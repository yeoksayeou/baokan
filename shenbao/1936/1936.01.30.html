<p>今日國際和平最大之障礙莫過於野心國家無限度之土地慾望與侵略行動但最足令人失望者卽國際間對於此種破壤國際和平之　武行為不能有一致的澈底的對付方法與行動自上决大戰而後國際間有識人士咸知兵凶戰危敗者雖創鉅痛深莫可名狀勝者亦精疲力竭恢復為難故於和平之要求倍覺殷切其表現淤事實者首則有國聯盟的之締結稍後又有非戰公的之成立二者之中允以國聯盟的具有實際的效力蓋十六條之規定對於侵略者有制裁之力量也據是而觀世界之政治家對於國際和平之維持固曾盡其極大之努力顧事實所昭示我人者卽僅有保持國際和平之公約而無維持和平公的之一致的决心與行動則戰爭與侵略終無以消滅也</p>
<p>縱觀三五年間國際事態之演變破壞世界和平之國家雖屬少數維持國際和平之國家雖屬多數然和平勢力之所以終未能戰勝　武好戰之勢力者卽在愛好和平之國家不能有眞正擁護和平排斥侵略之决心與共赴此一鵠的之一致的行動如「九一八」事件以英法等强國為骨幹之國聯若能對侵略者施以制裁而非戰公的發起人之美國又能進為實力上之策應則遠東局面自當大為改觀同時國聯有此一度懲戒黷武國之事實表現則其聲威之振必非今日之此卽意大利之對阿侵略戰爭不至爆發亦未可知蓋意大利之對阿侵略實于國聯不能對日制裁窺破弱點始敢冒天下之大不韙以步日本之後塵故今日之和平實為整個的若於某一區域不能量澈共和平之目的乃欲於他處保持其安全於勢必不可能蓋惡例一開則懷有同樣野心之國家皆將接踵而起也</p>

<h3>中央救災組織方針</h3>
<p>貝克顧問自於民國五年應交通部之聘來華後。留華已有廿年。先後在山東陝西山西等省創辦工振。跋涉災區不辭勞苦。年來歷任國府救濟水災委員會黃河水災救濟委員會等委員。中央振務委員會顧問等職。計廿年中無一日不從事於救災之工作。近以回國在卽。本諸以往之經騐。著有本篇。舉以相示。譯者識貝顧問有年。敬其熱忱。佩其良言。因譯之以供關心振務者之參考焉。譯者端源。</p>
<p>徵諸史乘。救災恤貧。向爲歷朝帝王所重視。弛懈之漸。當在淸末。古時救災之實施。先盡縣力。縣力不及。則以省力。省力不繼。則以國力。或積極的由國庫支撥賑欵。或消極的以命令豁免賦稅。自國民政府成立以後。庶政漸舉。對於救災。有更深切之注意焉。</p>
<p>救災凖備金</p>
<p>廿四年七月一日財政部實行將救災準備金列入預算。此可視為政府於救災工作切實負責之一重要步驟。然而救災金之存在。足以引起各省分配之爭議。因而稍有災害。卽故意誇大其災象之嚴重性。以期多獲支配。而各代表欲在本省爭面子。更不惜長篇累牘。將本省災况說得曠古絕後。致其結果。中央對於各省災况。不能得共實在。而於振欵之支配。亦不能得其公正。</p>
<p>公正不偏之災况展吿非不可獲</p>
<p>是故政府必須在各省函電之外。另覓災情之詳實報吿。以為支配之根據。今實業部中央農業實騐所之農情報吿。金陵大學對於農村之調查。俱足以供應用。由此種種報吿中。可以知悉災地收成情狀。一般食糧之貯蓄量。生活程度之比較。以及人口等事項。以資鑑別各災區內需要之輕重。而對於振欵之支配。得有更公允之比例焉。</p>
<p>按戶散放這不易</p>
<p>欲求災戶與災戶間之散放得公平之支配。較之省與省間之支配得當允為困難。或有避却此種困難。逕行免去調查手續。而按戶一例予以振濟者。此種辦法自不足採。按戶調查。本之救災原則。實屬必要。但此種工作。决非現有下級官吏可辦。一則官吏缺乏此種經騐。二則官吏為原有職務所覊。亦無充足之時間以供應用。是故向來各災區內所放外來振欵。須由外來辦振者實施調查。而後施放。而在調查之際。人民知其為查振人員。則凡有所詢。必以窮苦求振為答。將無一人不為非振不活者矣。如欲認眞細查。則以面積之廣。不獨費用甚巨。而且費時甚多。待其調查竣事。施放已失時效。何况卽認眞調查。被欺仍所不免乎。</p>
<p>施行工振為公平救濟之方法</p>
<p>如欲免去欺騙。减省調查費用。節短調查時間。則振欵散放。應得採用工振。凡災民加入工作者。按一最低之標凖給値。使其盡一日之力。得以所獲最低之値。購置最廉食料。足以養活一家老小。工値不宜超出此標準者。恐有競爭工作之危險。振欵易於竭盡。及誘致不應受振者亦插足在內故也。今在最低値工振制度之下。再以公示揭明災工姓名。則對於不應受振者之朦混。可以得有效之限制矣。如其施行此法。於較為富庶之省。而災工應徵者寥寥者。則足以徵明該地方尙有餘力。足以自給。無中央振濟之必要。若是則省與省間。災民與災民間。振欵之支配可得而均也。</p>
<p>但上述工振。自與國家徵工有別。工振給災工以最低工値。足以購置最廉食料。維持一家生活。是故曰振。徵工在平時雖屬可行。而在災區內則不應與工振同時存在。</p>
<p>災工之管理。亦應與普通工程上之僱工有異。不宜取包工制。在包工制下。工値經大包小包之手後。工人實得幾何。無從詢問。故災工之組織。應以二十五人至三十人為一排。設立排頭。直接統轄。並應設有訴願機關。禁止排頭尅扣舞弊。粗視之。此種辦法較諸包工制雖需增添許多排頭工頭之工資。而實際則因直接管理之緣故。可减少許多隔膜與工潮之發生。增進工作之效能。最後結果。仍較包工制為有利。而如以工作單位與辦法佈吿週知。並實行秘密視察。則一切工頭對於工人常有之惡習。以及種種弊端。皆可掃除殆盡。全國經濟委員會與各省建設廳所築公路。對除天災之防止。自有極大之效果。但其工程之本身。尙未能利用災工。使之對救災發生直接之作用。今後如能在災區內改用上述工振辦法。則在建設之外。更可生救災之效用矣。</p>
<p>義振之組織</p>
<p>壯丁之外。其有老弱寡孤乏入照顧。而自身又無力工作者。應取何法以救濟之乎。夫誰為無依無靠非濟不活者。此惟其鄰居知之。非可由中央振務機關所派來查放人員得而鑑別者也。是故中央振欵不應用在義振。而應以地方之欵。由地方團體分別振濟之。中央與省政府旣担負壯年人及其家屬之救濟。地方之寡孤老弱。儘地方之力救濟之。當無不足。</p>
<p>積穀制亟應恢復</p>
<p>義振應由本地慈善團體辦理。已如上述。本地之財力。又自何而來乎。積穀之制。行之於中國已久。至少每縣必有一倉。豐歲所藏。卽是地方之財力。所以謀歉年之不及也。沿江河交通之地。倉庫之設允感重要。高低之地。相隔無幾。此盈彼虛。常相反比。如其設立公倉。互相調劑。自可互免窮迫之苦。沿江濱湖灘地。為汗泥所積成。土質肥沃。圍而耕之。在水小之年。收獲特豐。但其地原屬江湖之一部。為容納洪水之地位。故堤圍之築。工事之設施。要不宜妨害其容納洪水之功用。在旱歲水位不高。自應利用耕植。以資生產。但遇有大水時。應不得强阻其為洪水之容納。而以鄰邑為壑。處此時期。卽應以積穀為維持。而可母求於他人。故如倉庫之制能在灘田地方積極實施。則灘田農民生活得有保障。國家之水利設施。亦可免遭反對與阻碍矣。</p>
<p>現在政府與人民對於倉庫之建設。已有積極之行動。內政部於民國十九年一月十五日曾頒行各地方倉儲管理規則。夫內政部為一監督之機關。而提倡之責任。仍在各振務機關團體也。</p>
<p>在積穀倉制未普遍設立以前。地方國體。如何担荷義振之方法。可以此决山東應付水災之方法為鑑。山東省之辦法。係將災區內之災民。移至鄰縣就食。移食人數。以各該鄰縣原有人口為標準。不得超過一定之百分數。故旣不致爲鄰縣之累。而被災者亦免為餓　焉。</p>

<h3>中國自然區域簡說　中央大學敎授</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>近年中國地理學日漸發達，自然區域的研究也漸趨精密，尤以竺可楨先生的八大區域，提綱挈領，常為地學家所依據。（丁文江等編中國分省新圖載有此圖）。鄙人曾說中國地理以地形為第一綱領，氣候為第二綱領。但地形分佈較為複雜，不如氣候較有系統，竺先生的分區，以氣候為主，同時兼顧地形方面。近年新的研究像土壤區域植物區域等，與竺先生的氣候區域相比觀，常有相和益彰之妙。鄙人從前所編敎科書曾分中國為二十三區，當我可用這八大區來統攝。現在把這八大區的基本事實，簡單說明於後。</p>
<p>華南區　或稱嶺南區，包括福建廣東廣西三省，一月（最冷之月）平均溫度在攝氏十度以上，雨量在一千公里厘至一千五百公厘左右。這區域的特色，可以說沒有冬天，但是與　帶的終年皆夏又不同。因為尙有春季或秋季的調節，所以稱為副　帶（Subtropicai）氣候，海南島則完全位於熱帶。除了珠江三解洲以外，本區大都是邱陵地，南嶺山脈遠不及北嶺之整齊而雄峻，最高也不過二千公尺。河流除珠江系統外多獨自入海，其上流多深入分水嶺脊，湘桂同源為最著名的現象。本區植物在氣候較冷時有落葉現象之發生，稱為夏林區域，以別於熱帶雨林的色彩。廣東棕桐科植物，如椰子，檳榔，蒲，葵等，觸目皆是。海南島為中國惟一可種樹膠之區。閩廣又盛產副熱帶果實，如香蕉，鳳梨，荔枝，龍眼，橘柚，橄欖等是。本區山地居多，人烟稠密，多海久發展，為南洋及美國等處華僑之故鄕，偏僻的山地尙有未開化民族存在如黎人猺人是。</p>
<p>華中區　或稱大江區，大致為長江流域各省，冬季各月平均溫度在攝氏十度以下，但十一月份尙在十度以上，雨量在七百五十公厘以上。本區氣候特色，為四季節奏甚為分明，各月雨量分佈亦頗均勻。地形大部分為平原與邱陵地，如大江三角洲為沖積平原，大湖區域有湖成平原。漢水上流已經到了高山地帶，但漢中附近為一局部平原，漢族之名由此而起，北面由秦嶺棧道通長安，極富於歷史興味。又四川成都附近也是一種內陸平原·比漢中平原規模更大。本區植物落葉現象殊為顯者，在邱陵地或高山針葉樹常位於闊葉樹之上，邱陵地水道多暢通，林業頗盛，以松杉為主，　葉樹種類極多，楓與樟樹皆長至甚大。四川一省雖在長江流域，但甚氣候特溫暖，冰雪不常見，故有副　植物如榕樹，荔枝，橘柚，甘庶等。蓋四川為一盆地，中間邱陵地海凌，僅六百公尺左右，四圍山脈高自一千至四千公尺，西北二方高山綿巨，尤有罪蔽冬季寒風之效。四川水利亦極佳，古稱江之利在蜀　之　在楚，大江自出三峽以後始多水患。大江中下流的平原以種水稻為主，水牛縱橫，草舍零落，為世界上居民最稠密之地，中國大米市皆在於此。邱陵地之生產以茶，麻，銻，　，瓷器，竹紙等為最重要。大江三角洲，水道條分縷析，以桑園棉毛田為原料，成為中國工業中心，尤以絲業棉業均為最盛。舟山羣島漁業甚為發達。</p>
<p>華北區　或稱黃淮區，包括黃河流域中下游各省，以秦嶺淮水與華中區分界，故陜西南部屬華中區江蘇安徽北部屬華北區。本區十一月份平均溫度在攝金工十度以下，但在零度以上，全年平均溫度在攝氏十度以上，全年雨量在四百公厘以上。本區東部除山東半島外為大平原，由黃河淮水海河等冲積而成。惟水道屢經遷徒潰决，又有運河縱貫南北，洽水問題最為重要。陜西中部渭河流域為內陸平原，陜北與山西均為高原，海拔一千公尺左右，中間亦有局部盆地適於耕種。本區以數千年農墾之結果，森林多被砍伐，問有若干高峯猶存殘景，以冬季嚴寒而乾燥之故，闊葉樹與針葉樹多相雜而生，果木如桃梨之類發育異常完美。淮河為中國農業上之重要界綫，分別南方之水田與北方之旱田，華北作物多為小麥高梁玉蜀黍小米之類，是謂　　區域。陜西則漢中平原為爾田區域，逾　嶺以北　渭河平原，亦為旱　區域，華北產棉花亦甚重要，礦業則河北河南山東詣省，煤礦　　甚發達，黃河西岸山西陜西二省煤礦綿藏極富，陜北之石油山東之貿鋁礦，在國防上尤有價値。山東半島為東三省移民之　源地，農民多數　　偕往，單身者　往秋歸。</p>
<p>東北區　本區幾括東北省全部，全年平均溫度在攝氏十度以下，每年至少有五個月在攝氏零度以下，全年雨量在五百公厘左右，最多有達一千公厘者。本區地形大都為平原與邱陵地。松花江與遼河流域之平原，即所謂松遼平原，屬於平蕪帶。平蕪亦為一種草原，樹木甚少見，惟原通常皆指乾燥區域，平蕪則較為濕潤。東北平原現已改造面民農業區域，氣假雖甚嚴酷，而土壤肥沃，雨澤充沛，不麥大豆，產量至豐，為我國移民之尾閭，亦為天留之農寶庫。目前東北平原地之居民約二千萬人，可再容納二千萬人。長白山與興安嶺森林亦極著名，有所謂窩集者，即大山老林之意。東省木材如紅松，杉松，黃花松，等，均供建築材料，用途最廣。平原與邱陵接觸之地礦產尤富，煤鐵石油金礦等，礦業發達為全國最。</p>
<p>雲貴區　雲南貴州二省為高原地，海拔一千至二千公尺，其氣候為副熱帶之改善者，寒署變遷甚少，有四時如春之快，全年平均溫度在攝氏十四度至十八度之間，全年雨量在七百五十公厘以上，氣候雖佳，而地形甚為崎嶇，俗有「地無三里平」之諺，昆明等處之湖成平原，為高原環境之最佳者，但限於局部，此區植物暢茂，多特異之種類，而森林不多，農產以玉蜀黍為主。又因交通困難，開發較　，漢人大都由明淸二代由大江區遷往者。貴州高山尙為苗族之窟宅。雲南西部地形差異甚大，怒江瀾滄江下流，地勢低下，氣候炎熱，有熱帶性植物，與華地區相似，至大理以北，高山疊峙，而以高植物著稱於世。故雲南西部之民族常分三層，白美居於火熱之河谷，野人居於寒冷之高山，漢人則居於一千三四百公尺左右之高原，其地氣候凉爽，最適健康。</p>
<p>草原區　本區包括東三省之西邊熱河省及察哈爾綏遠寗夏三省之南部，及甘肅省大部分之地，全年平均溫度在攝氏五度至下度，全年雨量在三百至四百公厘。本區大致為高原地形，即黑龍江省之呼倫貝爾高原，內蒙高原，甘肅高原是，甘肅高原溝堅遍布，古稱隴坂，地形亦頗崎嶇。黃河上流經過本區，沿河或擴為內陸平原，如寗夏平原，河套平原是。本區以雨量過少，致成為不雜樹木之乾燥草原，以多年生草本為主要成分蒙人遊牧於此，居於帳幕，以牲畜皮毛為生計，蒙古馬匹向來在邊政上甚關重要。黃河沿岸便於灌溉之處，農業亦頗發害，蘭州所產小麥烟草及果樹，品質甚佳。寗夏河套一帶，農田亦限於渠道經流之處，寗夏以產大米著，綏遠等地以小麥為主要糧食，質味均殊，為他　所未有，蓋以生長時期短促使然。</p>
<p>蒙新區　外蒙古新疆及甘肅省之河西區（甘凉肅州一帶）屬之，全年雨量减至二百公厘以下，成為沙漠帶，因位於大陸中心，冬夏寒署變遷至為劇烈。水道多　於鹽湖，是謂內流區域。蒙古新疆地形不同，新疆山脈較高，且迴環四合，故盆地之形勢特著，天山北部稱為凖噶爾盆地，天山南路稱為塔里木盆地，甘肅河西區因有南北二山之對峙，成為長廓形之地，均屬高山地帶，蒙古則高原坦蕩，山脈不高，而復散漫，僅科布多鳥梁海一帶稍見盆地之跡象。本區在氣候上屬沙漠帶，植物極少且極疏散，不毛之赤地實較植物生長地為多。本區居民皆居於沙漠周圍之沃地，即所謂水草田，零星散布，如海中之島嶼，故亦稱沙島，惟賴駱駝隊以相聯貫。此等肥田皆藉高山雪水涓涓下注以資灌溉，村落周圍或渠道兩旁，皆種有白楊與柳樹，遠望頗為葱蘢。農作物如米麥棉絲，局部言之，頗為豐饒，果品如葡萄西瓜，尤見稱於世。至於高山區域雨量在百公厘以上之處亦有森林，如天山北坂之樅樹（即杉松），其最著者。外蒙古自庫倫以外，受北冰洋濕氣之餘澤，已入西伯利亞森林帶，在水道上亦屬於北冰洋的系統。本區民族頗複雜，外蒙古大部分為蒙人，間有漢商，天山北路漢回蒙哈（哈薩克）四族雜處。天山南路漢回二族雜處，大城市均有漢回二城，河西區以漢人為主，其地自古為中亞陸路交通之要道，在國防上極為重要。</p>
<p>西藏區　本區兼包西藏西康靑海及甘肅四川雲南接壤之地，平均海拔皆在三千公尺以上，周圍復有五千公尺以上之高山雪嶺。冬季西藏全境溫度皆遠在冰點以下，在夏季亦僅南方較低之高原有五六個月平均溫度在冰點以上，西藏大部分之地，雨量與草原區相似。就大體而言，本區為一寒冷的荒漠地，其地非完全無雨，但其少量之雨，大部分皆下降成雪。本區最高之地為西藏北部，海拔達五千公尺，皆為荒山窮谷，不毛之地。長江大河之發源地及靑海沿岸，草地甚為寬廣，宜於放牧。至於江河支流的谷地，如靑海西寗，西康巴安等地，海拔較低，（但在全國已為各省會之最高者）農業漸盛。西藏拉薩位於海拔三千公尺之河谷中，居民亦事農耕。本區最普通之農作物為靑粿，乃一種耐寒之大麥。又代表本區之動物為　牛，其性極耐寒苦，如稱駱駝為沙漠之舟，牛亦可稱為寒漠之舟。凡有靑粿犁牛之處，即為西藏族游牧所及之範圍，這也是人地關係顯著的例證。</p>

<h3>上海之新藥業（續）　中國微信所主編上海工商業概況之十一</h3>
<p>（二）藥品及藥商之種類</p>
<p>藥品種類——按照新藥業常用之分類法，藥品種類可分為下列六種：</p>
<p>一原料：此又分為工業及醫用兩種。工業原料如鹽酸，硝酸，大蘇打。紅　等，除少數由藥房販運外，大多數則由大豐，國泰，國華，寳興，振業等工業原料商經辦。醫用原料如退熱餅，安知必林，甘錄，灰碘等，必須經過配製手續始可應用。</p>
<p>二成藥：如百　機，阿司匹　，自來血，怕勒托等，購得後即可服用之製成品，即為成藥。此又可分為二種，一種出國外輸入，一種係由本國藥商自行配製，但其原料之採用仍多來自國外。</p>
<p>三針藥：如福爾賜保命等，雖係一種製成品，但針藥之施用，必須經過注射手續，非任何人皆能使用。</p>
<p>四機械：名自繁多，不勝枚舉，槪分之有：花柳科機械，牙科機械，眼科機械，獸科機械，兒科機械，婦科機械，外科機械等。</p>
<p>五化妝品：化妝品旣有化醜為妍之醫療功能，而其配合成分又多係醫用原料，現雖一部為他業所奪，但仍不失為新藥業中重要營業之一。如大陸藥房之雅霜，中西藥房之明星花露水，好來公司之面友，在全部營業額中，佔極大地位。</p>
<p>六雜品：如紗布棉花橡皮膠等。</p>
<p>藥商種類——上海之藥商，按其營業性質或營業方式而言，有製造，販賣，調劑，等等區別。其奮鬥製造者，有信誼等十五家，今將其廠名，地址及其主要出品列表於後：</p>
<p>除製造外，同時又兼販賣及調劑者，則有五洲等八家：</p>
<p>此外，販賣兼調劑者，有華美等十家；專營販賣者，有大中華等九家；專營調劑者，有新劑及中央兩家，今一併列記於后，以供查考：</p>

<h3>參觀植物油燈記</h3>
<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>自從本刊仰堯先生一度介紹植物油燈以後，頗引起一般關懷國貨人士的注意；筆者也是其間一份子；只緣油燈一物，它的普遍性，是不分熱鬧的城池，偏僻的村莊，都有它的脚影兒；我國有句成語：敎做「開門七件事，」這七件事，就是「油」「鹽」「柴」「米」「醬」「醋」「茶」了；其實米不一定家家戶戶都有福分享受，　粱肉的固然白飯無虞，飽　食的同胞們，也到處可見，但是無論四壁怎樣蕭然？唯其一盞星星螢火，是少不了的，雖一燈如豆，相對黯然，這盞燈依舊是不可或缺；關於燈的需要，關於國貨前途的興衰繁枯，關於堵塞民族經濟漏巵，仰翁都曾縷述過個中利害，現在毋庸　言；如今植物油燈，已經開始發售，我且把目擊經過，奉告讀者，這個發行廣告，是在新年元旦日觸現眼簾的；我記明了經售處所，那天特異地前往觀光，走進愛多亞路的益豐搪瓷廠發行所，知道樣品雖有六七種，而正式發售的纔僅一式；左首櫥櫃上點了盞油燈，是實地給顧客參觀的，我對樣式光亮，都表示滿意；現在有幾點鄙陋之見，應與原發明人商榷，售價雖只三角八分，似乎猶難普及，因為市上一般煤油燈，僅二角左右，相差幾及一倍！恐怕非農村細民，個個可以戶購一盞，燈心應增小號，俾更節油量；燈罩清潔法，燈油加添法，應咐使用簡圖，及文字說明，比方經售該燈的益豐發行所，應設暗室兩小間，點植物油燈，煤油燈，各一盞，光亮的判別，使顧客得到有力鐵證，至於經售店員，應遴選富有商業修養者擔任，不論交易之成否，應詳答顧客探問，總之這是件新興國貨事業，要犧牲！要普及！以得到大衆信仰與購用為最高原則！筆者觀感所及，拉雜書此，讀者可將仰堯先生之參觀記參閱也。</p>
<h3>談談紹興酒</h3>
<p>— 紀一介</p>
<p>說到我國產酒的種類，不在少數，約略計之，有浙江的紹興酒，江蘇的洋河高粱，山西的汾酒，安徽的大麺，遼寗的牛莊高粱，都是很著名的，因為紹興是我國最著名的產酒量之鉅，行銷之廣，任何酒類都夠不上牠，紹興酒在國貨酒類中，旣然佔第一位，那是值得一談的，此本文之所由作也。</p>
<p>眞眞紹興酒，係用鑑湖水所製，旣得天賦良好的水質，復經千餘年製造的經騐，故其酒，質厚而味醇，有藏至二三十年的陳紹興酒，飲之有香清意遠，不可名言之妙，一般有太白淳于劉伶之癖者，天天在酒中討生活，關於酒的新陳美惡，到口一試，便知分曉，且飲量亦愈練愈大，每飲輒盡四五六觔，還有婚喪欵客，祭祀酬神，均需用酒，於此，紹興酒每年消耗額，可想而知了。</p>
<p>紹興地方，大小酒家，一共有一千八百餘家，大釀戶每家每年造酒數千缸，小釀戶則數百缸數十缸不等，總計全縣每年產酒數量，在二十萬缸以上，價值達四千數百萬元，除一部分在本地販賣外，大都運銷杭州，上海，轉運至長江，珠江，黃河各流域，以及東三省等處，卽海外如南洋新嘉坡，印度各埠，也有輸出，其在本地販賣的，稱本莊，行銷外埠的，稱路莊，路莊酒約佔全年產額百分之五十，僅捐稅一項，年約九百餘萬元，躉批零賣的酒商，以及賴酒衣食的技士工人，不下數千萬人，不可謂不發達了。但因造酒方法，猶仍舊貫，所用器械，亦未改良，以致近年來，營業方面，逐漸為外國酒商所奪，出產數額，亦漸見減折，長此以往，紹興酒業，勢將一蹶不振，近聞某國已在東北籌設大規模的釀酒廠，以期抵制紹興酒的輸入，如果紹興酒業，再不急起直追，研究改良製造推銷之法，以圖挽救，竊恐將來，難免同絲茶一樣的失敗呢。</p>

<h3>最低限度的提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>政府中人先要嚴格的用國貨　國貨工廠和商人要一致服用</p>
<p>一天，許多朋友談提倡國貨的辦法，大家都說得極澈底，極扼要，胡君西園孫君道勝的主張，更覺乾脆，實在也是提倡國貨底最低限度的條件。他們說：</p>
<p>一至少限度，在政府機關服務的人員，要一律的嚴格的服用國貨。在政府做事，吃政府飯用政府錢的，尙不去用國貨，誰來用國貨？這般人不愛國，呌誰去愛國？</p>
<p>二至少限度在國貨工廠和國貨公司商店服務的人，要一致的嚴格的服用國貨，在國貨工廠商店做事的，吃國貨飯用國貨錢的，倘自己不用國貨，呌誰去用國貨？你們自己先不信仰國貨，有誰來信仰國貨。</p>
<p>在座的黃任之，林康侯，諸文綺，張惠康，許曉初，王性堯，徐緘若諸公，都拍手贊成認為這是最起碼最低限度的請求，希望不必高談，不必闊論，大家先做到這一點，再談別種。</p>

<h3>初試鋒芒　中華籃球隊擊敗麥令　廿員戰士輪流上塲　理想陣綫已餓端倪</h3>
<p>出席全國籃球預選賽之華北·南京·上海·三隊、經已三度作戰、刻選拔委員會正在審密檢察各個技能、挑選正式人員、昨特的麥令司在申園試賽、俾資精愼觀察、觀者達八九百人、由三隊輪替與麥令作戰、强頑之麥令、抵有追隨之力、而無獲勝可能、上半時為一八對十六、結果四七對三五、中華吿捷、</p>
<p>登峯造極　中華隊集全國球星二十名應戰、先由王玉增三鴻斌牟作雲李紹棠王南珍之最為理想之精銳、攻打頭陣、跳球之後、傳遞之敏捷、穿梭之矯活、嘆為觀止、博得四座采聲雷動、在牟作雲開紀錄之端後、五將珠聯璧合、王玉增得全軍之努力、於十分鐘內、六度建績、回顧麥令、一籌難展、比較為二十對五、登入最高峯、</p>
<p>相持之局　於是我軍即調馮志華尹貴仁蔡演雄上場、攻守之形勢、較為寬施、勃利士史帝兒乃漸漸獲分、追至十三對二十二、旋又調徐亨代替王玉增、局勢依然無甚開展、成相持之勢、分數各餓增加、至時間休息時、中華以二八對十六居先、</p>
<p>形勢略鬆　檸檬之後、列陣再戰、中華陣上更有調動、往來攻守、與前場之後十分彷彿、但麥令仍為望塵莫及之嘆、前鋒進衝格格不相入、僅憑衛士薛拂期及墨飛遠投建分、中華則沈聿恭立績、彼此各餓中的、在此段落中、我軍紀錄較彼多四球、</p>
<p>最後演出　嗣此之後、中華再調第叫批生力軍作戰、攻守之間、益形呆滯、於是麥令之史帝爾勃利士頻頻進窺、風浪屢見被其連加九分、比數追至三十一對四十、在旁運籌帷幄之董舒宋三君、决定再調首批作戰、將士出場、居然水到渠成、麥令掙扎雖烈、相形之下、為七五之比耳、鑼聲一響、戰事完畢、中華以四七對三五得勝、定明日再與全滬錦標海賊探討矣、雙方成績如左、</p>

<p>『也不說你是抱憾嗎』？裴先生問道，看他那種變態，甚為憂慮。</p>
<p>『我沒有什麼抱憾』。</p>
<p>『我不等他請求，就饒了他』，韜摩說道，覺得看到勇敢的唐恩受了辱比膽怯的乃德受了辱還要難過。</p>
<p>『也不要人饒』，唐恩又粗聲粗氣回答道。</p>
<p>『等到你獨自一個兒，把這件事想過一番之後，也許你要的，我現　不願告訴你我是多麼驚駭和失望，不過等了一下之後我會到你房裹來和你細談』。</p>
<p>『沒有什麼干係』，唐恩說道，他本要以挺撞的口吻繼續說去，然而等他仰頭一見了裴先生那種憂愁的臉色，叉怔住了；於是，就以剛才的一句話作為臨走的話兒，便離了那房間，就彿他覺得也不能再多留一刻了。</p>
<h3>高麗隊守門欠佳　四比五敗於華北隊　上半時高麗先發制人連得三球　下半時華北時來運來反敗為勝</h3>
<p>高麗延禧大學足球隊、此决乘春節假期、作一年一度之長征、初職逢港滬西人聯隊、失敗固在意中、惟昨日第二戰逢華北、以四比五又遭慘敗、上半時高麗會以三比〇遙遙居前、華北僅恃十二碼球、打破鴨蛋、惟下半時高麗動作慌張、連失四城、　被華北以五比四超出、領隊馬的翰笑容滿面、對茲一班燕幽健兒、頗懷厚望也、</p>
<p>金成　連中三元　開賽後、華北先攻、洪聖恩在戒備區內撞人、被判十二碼、孫福來主踢、脚頭雖急、惜徧出網外、華北失此良機、反被高麗攻破要壘、金成　勇冠三軍、能盤能射、在離門五六碼處、舉足叩網、首開紀錄之門、中綫開球後、姜璐屢决沿邊進襲、惜與中路不能取得聯絡、無功而返、中堅譚福禎盤球略遲、被韋惠德搶去、三數傳遞、叉為金成　攻入一球、四座球迷、無不為華北擔憂、此後高麗攻勢仍盛、華北後防、險象環生、楊春英慌忙失措、一個大意、又被金成　一蹴進網、造成三比零絕對優勢、</p>
<p>十二碼扳回一城　華北諸將、見要防連夕失守、一時全軍用命、齊心反攻、姜璐孫永泉左衝右突、運蹴中路、高麗內衛急於救球、又犯重視、二决被判十二碼球、華北隊鑒於第一球之失、乃鄭重將事、仍由孫福來主踢、不偏不倚、正中網心、造成一比三、此時五前錄漸能呼應、聯成一氣、孫福來中路發球、惜過高未進、姜璐沿邊再進、帶球深入、正欲射門、被守門搶去、祇逼成角、最後李鳳樓截球遠射、被守門接住、上半時遂吿終了、</p>
<p>左右翼各樹一功　檸檬後、易陣再戰、高麗大舉進攻、華北後防空虛、被柳喜春從容蹴進一球、此時怒惱邊將姜璐、在左路指揮作戰、這面孫、永泉恰巧趕到、得球方射、居然申的、高麗反攻未就、球又被譚福楨攔刦、運送前方姜瑯奔抵敵門、利用左脚、反鈎進網、三比四祇負一球、全軍聲勢益震、譚福楨奮勇應戰、略受小創、未幾即入陣重戰、</p>
<p>小姜璐奠定勝局　高麗諸前鋒、雖在前方候機進襲、惜中路不善接濟、徒呼負負、而華北諸將、愈戰愈勇、孫永泉孤軍深入、盤過三關、對門力射、造成四四和局、球迷皆大歡喜、最近姜璐又出其偷營故智、見球已到脚、不待落地、歪鈎人網、五比四反敗為勝、奠定江山、未幾銀笛長嘯、時間終了、散場後、球迷圍住搬場汽車、爭看小將姜璐風頭之健、頗不亞於李球怪也華北隊楊春英　張學堯　朱淸玉徐斐民　譚福楨李鳳樓姜璐　閻承寬孫福來趙啟春　孫永泉高麗隊金忠炫鄭龍珠洪聖恩田璘秀（下）韓甲錫　丁海敦（上）金演碩　金成　　李裕　　李奉鎬　韋惠德　柳喜春</p>

<h3>英國小學體育科分隊訓練法（三）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>領隊的職責、</p>
<p>領隊並不是一個有名無實的領袖、他應有正當的職責、起初、他是領導全隊、如採隊時、他自己先立在前面排好、然後全隊照着他排、或做其他活動時、他自己先做、然後全隊跟着他做、後來、敎師可讓領隊命令全隊排齊、看是吾排在正常地點、或排得整齊、在做分隊活動時、教師要訓練領隊安排全隊的隊員都有輪値活動的機會、在發令時、領隊應立在距離全隊適當的地方、在變換隊形時、領隊司在前引導、叫全隊跟着他走、以成新的隊形、這些領隊的職務應該及早成立、任何領隊能先做到即可得到敎師的讚許、領隊應該負責取出和歸還各種運動器具、後來、他還要負責將這些器具安置適賞、並能劃分塲地、這些工作可以在敎師的指導之下練習做好、假如在活動中需要帮助時、領隊應首先帮助隊員、但是每僩隊員也應輪流帮助他人、必要時、領隊也應負責記載隊員各個人的成續如跳遠等但是這種記載隊員也可自已輪流担任、領隊應該注意全隊隊員是吾均能有目的地練習、或餓適當的輪流、因而可以保持活動的興趣、他也要注意敎師所說明的規則是吾都為隊員所遵守、如跳前要走幾步等、有時、敎師可以詢問領隊、在隊員中有那些人做得最好的、然後請這些人出來做給全體看、同時敎師加以批評、這樣才可使全體兒童得着正確的表演和良好的結果、</p>
<p>利用競爭心</p>
<p>競爭心是鼓勵努力的動機、特別是在體育活動中、競爭是多數兒童自然的傾向、隊與隊之間的競爭是一個良好的刺激、而且是每隊忠心合作練習的動機、但是敎師要注意過分的競爭和在細微的事件上競爭、倒反要减少興趣、還有、不要强迫兒童去作隊與隊之間的競爭、競爭的動機頂好要發自兒童的需要、現在有一種競爭尙未為多數學校所採用的、就是各個人要設法與他自己過去的成績競爭、設法打破他自已過去的紀錄、還餓一種良好的競爭方法、就是鼓勵全班和全隊的份子共同競爭、設法達到全班或全隊的最高標凖、這些競爭的方式都是分隊訓　中可以採用的良好訓練方法、　（完）</p>

<p>本委員會認為兒童讀物，是兒童的「精神的食糧」、影響於兒童敎育、極其重大、所以乘這兒童年實施的期間、徵集全國兒童讀物二千多種、一萬幾千册、自二十五年一月三十日起、至二月五日止、公開展覽於首都、並且在首都展覽之後、預備運送出去、巡迥展覽於全國各重要地方、在開會的開始、謹將舉行兒童讀物展覽會的旨趣、揭櫫如左、</p>
<p>（一）供國人槪覽以正國人　對於兒童讀物的觀感</p>
<p>國人對於兒童讀物、大槪都很忽略、有的以為無足重輕、置之不聞不問不議不論一列、有的只看到一部分、覺得和自己的主觀不相合、便大聲疾呼、斥為謬妄……這些態度、都足以摧毀兒童讀物改進的新苗而有餘、此决、我們把各種兒童讀物集中一處、公開展覽、請國人概覽一番、我們以為至少可以使國人知道、　我國的兒童讀物、居然有這麼許多、差不多也是「皇皇巨著」、在出版界上佔有重要的地位、　這些書、也都是花了許多著作家的心思、許多出版家的財力……編印成的、並不是偶然的無聊、　「供以應求」、這是一定的道理、兒童們需要這些書、所以出版界才出版這些書、兒童們何故需要這樣的書、而不需要舊式的「三字經」以及「聖經賢傳」、這裹面也一定「自有道理」、　這些書、和十多年二十多年前的兒童書、面目已經大大改變了、為什麼要改變、其中也一定有一個重要的原因、　道些書自然有好有壤、可取可去、在只見一鱗半爪、未窺全豹、未加仔細研究的以前、不能輕下斷語、一筆抹殺、</p>
<p>（二）供專家研究以為改進　並選擇兒童讀物之一助</p>
<p>我國的兒童讀物、有好有壤、如果不加研究、不予批評、那末不但著作人和出版界無所準繩、不知所以改進之道、就是學校家庭、也無所準繩、無從選擇取去、此决、我們把兒童讀物、集中一處、並且把外國的兒童讀物做參考資斜、聘定幾十位研究有素的專家、組織評判委員會、加以研究、予以評判、並且希望未被聘的專家、也把好的意思、盡量寫出來、送交評判委員會或者本委員會參考、我們以為研究的結果、一定會有一個系統分明的報吿書編印出來、指點兒童讀物的一般優點和共同缺點、貢獻給著作界、出版界以及學校家庭、為改進兒童讀物或選擇兒童讀物之標準、自然、評判委員會等的研究結果、未必就可以算是最精確的標準、但是有助於兒童讀物的改進和選擇、那是可以斷言的、</p>
<p>（三）供文壇參考以期新舊　文學家多多致力於兒童　讀物之編著</p>
<p>我國新舊文學家、大多不注意於兒實讀物、允不屑編著兒童讀物、以為兒童讀物是「薄物小篇」、是「卑卑不足道」的東西、用不到自已去注意或努力、因此、出品瑕瑜互見、較偉大的作品、也無從產生、旣往的新舊文學家、也因興之所至、偶然翻譯或著作過一兩本兒童讀物、例如「愛的敎育」「托爾斯泰童話集」「小坡的生日」……之類、但是又因未用「大衆語」和「兒童語」編著的緣故、往往文字艱深、非多數兒童所能了解、此决、我們把各種兒童讀物、和各國優良兒童讀物、集中一處、請新舊文學家多多注意、我們希望大家鑒於兒童讀物的重要、鑒於外國文學家研究兒童文學的趨勢（各國多有兒童文學研究會、蘇聯大文豪高爾基也正研究提倡兒童文學、一九三四年、捷克京城、會開兒童文學作品展覽會、我國也選送優良讀物前往陳列……）、不再鄙視兒童讀物、急起研究著作、多多產生精純而偉大的作品、以使兒童讀物、大大地改觀、</p>
<p>此外、因道决的展覽、出版界或者也能因觀感所及、一變向來的態度、多多徵求善本、並改善印刷裝訂、以使兒童讀物精益求精、那末、本委員會的舉行這一次讀展、就更有意義了、會已開幕、希望國人專家·文學家·出版界……　袂來看、多多注意多多用力……以求造　於　童、幸甚幸甚、（完）</p>

<h3>淸末以來我國小學敎科書槪觀</h3>
<p>— 吳研因</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>淸朝末年、學校沒有興辦的以前、我國的兒童讀物、大的分兩種、一種是啟蒙的、例如三字經·百家姓·千字文·神童詩·千家詩·日用雜字書·日記故事·幼學等、一種是預備應科舉的考試的、例如四書·五經·史鑑·古文辭之類、這些讀物、有的沒有敎育的意義、有的陳義過高、不合兒童生活、而且文字都很艱深、敎學時除了死讀、死背誦之外、也不能使兒童們明暸到底讀的是些甚麼、兒童讀這些書、一定要花上了七八年的工夫、讀得爛熟了、再由老師開講、然後才能漸漸地明白一點字義跟章句、至於聖賢的大道理、往往讀了一輩子讀到老死、也讀不出甚麼來、固然從這些讀本讀起、再讀下去也會讀出幾個所調「通儒」來、但是一則成功的只是少數的天才、一則這些少數的天才也往往書讀通了、天才也成為廢才棄才了、這些廢才棄才、有的迂腐昏庸不辨粱麥、有的在妄放肆不近人情、……比了外國天才成為發明家科學家……有益於國計民生的眞是不勝可憐可惜之至、學校旣興、這些讀物、自然應當漸漸地退出了兒童敎育的領域、另有新興的小學敎科書、給兒童們做增進智慧的食糧、</p>
<p>新興的小學敎科書從淸來到現在、可以說常常在改革進步之中、究竟怎麼樣的改革進步呢、這個最好把現在的小學敎科書跟從前的小學敎科書、互相比較研究、再跟現代各國的小學敎科書、互相比較研究、然後詳細地分析說明、現在我沒有分析說明的工夫、只能籠統地憑自己所見到的、說一個大概出來、我覺得小學敎科書最重大的改革進步、大概有下列的幾點、</p>
<p>（一）白話文崛起　淸朝末年跟民國六年以前的小學敎科書、都是文言、商務印書館最新敎科書的文言、雖然比蒙學讀木蒙學課本的文明、簡明了些、但是要兒童了解、仍是很不容易、所以接着商務印書館等又有材料比較减少、文字比較淺顯的所謂簡明敎科書等出版、民國元年、中華書局崛起、發行一套新中華敎科書、這類敎科書、文字反不簡明、雖然因為政治的關係、很被小學敎育界所採用、但是不旋踵而就自然消滅、商務中華為求適應時勢需要起見、又各編了材料更少文字更淺顯的敎科書、所謂共和國敎科書·新制敎科書·實用敎科書·新式敎科書等等相繼出版、但是文言無論如何淺顯、兒童總不能直接了解、小舉敎課、把五分之四的工夫、用在讀書上面、結果也只造成了少數勉强能文的高材生、跟所謂國民敎育相差太遠、民國六年左右、我們覺得文字是一種工具、文言白話、功用差不多、但是白話文是用語言寫出來的、讀時容易明瞭、不必花去翻譯講解的工夫、作文也容易要說甚麼就寫甚麼、因此、主張小學用白話文編敎科書、就在所辦的小學裹、自編白話敎材、敎授兒童、坊間敎科書、首先加入一兩課白話課文的、就是中華的新式敎科書、辦法很不澈底、到了「五四運動」以後、文學革命和國語運動的高潮掀起、北京敎育部也竭力提倡國語、於是民國九年以後出版的小學敎科書、例如商務的新法敎科書中華的新體敎科書等、就都用白話編輯、文言敎科書就漸漸地歸於自然淘汰了、現在文言敎科書幾乎完全絕跡、即使有一兩本還被書坊私賣、保守派私用、但是力量究竟薄弱得　、不久的將來怕也一定會因不便敎學、歸於自然淘汰的、小學敎科書改文言為白話、這是一種重大的進步、也是小學敎學的自然趨勢、敎育部的提倡不過是促其速成罷了、敎育部即使不提倡、這趨勢也一定自然會來的、所以現在雖然還有人主張小學敎科書參用文言、或者竟强迫用文言甚至讀經、我想這不過是一時的現象、將來也一定會自然消滅、小學敎科書改用白話的結果、小學兒童讀書的能力、確實增進了許多、低年級六七歲的小孩也居然會自動地看起各種補充讀物來、高小畢業生雖然沒有讀過文言、可是用淺近文字寫作的書報、他們也粗枝少葉能够閱讀了、讀白話能收得這樣的效果、似乎不近情理、其實原因是很簡單的、因為高年級讀的白話課文、跟報紙記事體的文言、很相接近、所以結果、讀了白話也能看文言書報、這自然是就大體說、要是有人反說過來說、「自己從前在小學讀文言、結果能看文言書報、並且能寫很好的文言或白話論文、自己的兒子現在在小學讀白話、却就不但不能作文、並且不能看報丁、」那是他們父子兩個人的特殊情形不能概括多數、</p>
<p>（二）兒童文學抬頭　民國十年以前的敎科書、中間也有些童話寓言一類的故事、例如鷸蚌相爭·憑公移山·永某氏之鼠，黔驢之技等、但是分量很少、那時的初小國文、包括一切常識、大半是說明文、高小各種敎科書、更多數是說明文、說明文是很乾燥乏味的、讀的人對他生不出興味來、所以小學用這類敎科書、兒童大概興趣索然、大有一肯者諄諄聽者藐藐一的現象、有經騐的小學敎員、都知道這並不是一種好辦法、所以主張給兒童多讀些有趣的文字——允其是在國文中、一方面要兒童强記文字符號獲得運用文字的能力、一方面要兒童了解內容、獲得雜俎式的知識、未免「事倍功半」、「吃力而不討好、」所謂「兩敗俱傷」倒不如編些輕鬆的故事給兒童讀、使兒童只覺故事有趣、就不知不覺地肯去努力閱讀、無形中把文宇符號也熟習了、因為有這主張、所以民國四五年時的國文敎科書中就有了煤炭談話、水之自述等一類的課文、這類課文、把煤和炭的成因功用、水的變態等用擬人的對話體或自述體做出、這就是所謂「兒童文學化」、跟說明文根本不同了、民十左右又有人提倡兒童文學、他們以為兒童一樣愛好文學、坱需要文學、我們應當把兒童的文學給予兒童、因此　童文學的高潮就大漲起來、所謂新學制的小學國語課程就把兒童文學」做了中心各書坊的國語敎科書、例如商務的新學制·中華的新敎材新敎育·世界的新學制……就也拿兒童文學做標榜·採入了物話·寓言·笑話·自然故事·生活故事·傳說歷史故事兒歌民歌等等、別的敎科書如歷史地理等、也有人主張滲入此二文學的趣味但是沒有完全做到、自然、那時的所謂兒童文學是很幼稚的、不過從前的敎科書、內容太現實、而且用抽象的說明叙述、好此前幾年申報附刋的常識、沒餓幾個人要看、民十以後的敎科書、採入了和兒童生活比較接近的故事詩歌、好比是比較有趣的畫報·電影刊物、要看的人、也當然多起來了、兒童文學在敎科書中抬頭、一直到現在、並沒有改變、近幾年來、雖然有人因為反對所謂「烏言獸語」、反對整個的兒童文學（「烏言獸語」不能代表整個的兒童文學）恨不得把兒童文學攢出小學敎科書去、可是據敎育部去年擬了問題發交各省市小學敎育界研究的結果小學敎育界仍舊全國一致地主張國語課程、應當把兒童文學做中心、我們環顧歐美各國的小學敎科書、差不多早巳「兒童文學化」了、美國的小學敎科書允甚、蘇聯文壇近來也竭力提倡兒童文學、創造兒童文學、可見兒童文學决不會跟小學敎科書分起家來、即使有時被强迫而分家、也只是一時的現象、</p>
<p>（三）敎育目的逐漸正確</p>
<p>最初的小學敎科書、很注重修身忠君、愛國等的材料、民國以後、把忠君崇滿和不合民國宗旨的材料革去、加入了關於民主政治的自由思想、民四五因為袁世凱要做皇帝各書店也有所謂實用敎科書等出版、避去了民國共和等的字樣、因為第一次世界大戰的結束、和國內軍閥屢次內戰的恐怖、國內外都倡導和平、我國民十以後的小學的敎科書、例如新學制新敎育新敎材等、就幾乎成了無目的、無宗旨的世界通用讀本、很缺少民族精神和國家思想的表顯、這確是當時敎科齊的最大的缺點、民國十六年以後、革命空氣瀰漫了全國、小學敎科書例如商務的新時代·中華的新中華。世界的新主義等、就充滿了許多國民革命跟三民主義等的敎材、不過那時的敎科書、文字旣很草率、內容又未免多了些叫口號式的叫囂、民國廿年以後的敎科書、例如世界的新標凖、開明的開明、商務的復興、中華的新小學、大東的新生話等、叫囂的氣燄低了些、目的也逐漸正確了、各科敎科書、大概都能依照部定的各科課程標準編輯、國語敎科書、也能把民族精神做骨幹、特別注重救國雪恥等的敎材、而以發明故事、科學故事、讀書方法指導等等參雜其間、外界不明眞相、對於現行的小學敎科書、有兩種極矛盾可笑的看法、一方面一部分名流要人、以為小學敎科書只是些「烏言獸語」、沒有民族思想不能養成國的民族意識、一方面日本人却以為民族思想太濃了、認為是「仇日敎育」、逼着中國政府、要求修改小學敎科書、其實、我國的小學敎科書、雖然有些「鳥言獸語」、和民族思想、並不衝突、例如羊拒狗、狗拒狼等、就隱寓弱者抵抗强暴的意識、至於彰明較著關於民族思想的敎材、例如「李牧却甸奴」「蘇武牧羊」「班超定西域」「淝水之戰」「岳飛拒金」「采石磯虞允文却敵」袁崇煥却滿」「戚繼光平寇」……等課文、在小學敎科書中眞是不勝枚舉、國恥敎材、例如一鴉片之戰」「中法聯軍之役」「甲午之戰」……五三」「五九」「九一八」「一二八」等等也無不應有盡有、我以為說現在敎科書沒有民族思想、是盲目的、說現在的敎科書是「仇日」、也是一種誣罔、一個民族有一個民族的獨立精神跟光榮歷史、我們要獨立、我們亦是抵抗侵略、並不想侵略人家、我們只是根據歷史事實立言、並非虛構叫囂、如果世界上的公理還沒有完全毀滅的話、誰可說我們不應如此呢、</p>
<p>（四）敎材分量逐漸增加　　最初的敎料書如最新國文蒙學課本等、分量原不算少、後來、覺得文言文難於敎學、才逐漸把分量减輕了、民十以前的小學敎料書、分量實在太少、差不多只有一點枯骨、沒有筋肉、民九以後、改文言為白話、小學敎科書的分量、仍舊沒有增加、一本敎科書、往往只有一張新聞紙二十二開的四十八面、差不多一張半新聞紙、就可以裝訂成一本敎科書、最多的也不過六十四面、少的甚至只有三十二面、因此、各種敎村、都不能用文字充分的叙述、就是所謂兒童文學、也只是平舖直叙、沒有什麼描寫、實在當不起「文學」兩僩字、兒童讀了這樣貧弱得可憐的敎科書、所獲得的、實在太少了六年畢了業、跟初級中學也銜接不起來、最顯然的、初中敎科書少大約每本有二三百面、而小學六年級的敎科書、只有五六十面、兩相比較、大槪是五與一之比、你想分量相差到如此之多、怎麼銜接得起來呢、民國二十年以後、小學敎科書的分量、才逐漸增加了、其中以一兩種國語敎科書例如世界的國語新讀本兒意的兒童國語讀本等、增得加算最多、有的初級國語、多到一百七八十面、有的高級國語多到二百多面、比了以前、分量增加了好幾倍、內容也自然充實了、不過、有幾家的敎科書、分量仍舊極少、允其妃算術敎科書、連練習　也沒有幾個、（木文未完、續登明日本報敎育消息欄內）</p>

<p>紗市晨漲午跌、趨勢暗淡、蓋以現紗銷路轉趨沉寂、各帮進胃大滯、全日成交較前大為减色、致人心尤挫、但多頭方面、仍堅持不放、故檯面未見十分鬆動、午後拍開空盤、黑板甚多云、</p>
<p>標紗頭盤一度反動</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因上日跌風太熾、反動驟起、各月一致開拍高盤、且上日現紗生意活潑、散空抵補、二二盤甚堅、迨至收盤、聞現紗銷場大為减色、大阪三品紗市略挫、結果各月比上日收盤價漲四·五·六·八·九角、午後開盤各月一致下降、局勢突虛、因場中新買者缺乏、現紗交易僅三百包左右、於是人氣頓見衰弱、結果各月比上午收盤價跌二·四·七角、查賣出長豐八百五十包、裕大三百包、大豐七百五十包、達記三百包、信誠二百包、泰昌二百包、愼記二百包、買進潤康九百五十包、生源一千包、同和八百包、仁豐五包、長豐一千包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月跌三至四磅音、國外停市、華盛頓方面無發展、故市勢頗形不安、先以外商賣出而疲、旋以同業限價買進而回、終因經紀商·南方·及本地帮賣出、多頭了結、再度跌小、業外平談、雙方謹愼、現貨市場平靜、結果現貨跌十磅音、期貨二至七磅音、英印棉均因英皇葬事停市、原電錄左、（廿八日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　金融帮又起買　粉麥激漲無已</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤、各月份初定、繼則橫跳、洋麥報價、芝加哥曾跌一二角左右、故初尙平靜、旋為本月份因交割已近、外埠廠家均思抵回、近日現銷又頗活動、致人心高昂、大有軋空之勢、至遠期聞金融帮頗有染指、在此廠出稱少之際、高昂自覺容易、故近期即漲四分零、二三四月份激漲五六分之巨、六月份新粉因近斯之故、最高亦提至三元一角、迨至下行開盤、因金融帮又有收買、一二三月份又漲二三分、旋則大戶多頭回脫、遠期廠方亦有套售、故三四六月份即步回二三分不等、惟本月份因空戶受軋、仍然挺健、後步觀察、本月份當難斯低落云、</p>
<p>麥市各有份均見一致良好之象、以底碼不豐、距新收時期、尙遙遙無斯、業內外人心、早呈穏固、近則粉市逐步高漲、更引起業中人之注意、故開價時即漲三五分、後則又復步提、迨至下午開盤、本月份因貨量不足、即高提七分二月份以下則錢莊帮聞有大量收買、致交易甚暢、幸有老多頭回出、及客戶之套賣、漲勢遂見停頓、惟以近况而言、將來難免呈紛擾之局耳、現麥高貨未開、中次貨提高五分、開漢口麥四元七角、次六角四分、由阜豐辦一千包、福新辦四百包云、</p>
<h3>黃豆為餅銷帶起</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因餅銷活潑、全市成交期現各餅約有四萬六七千片、故廠家豆豆胃依然蟬聯、行情續緊三四分、辦去車輪各豆萬餘包、杜豆沙黃廣汕兩帮採取二千餘包、市砌四五分、四平街豆廣帮妥去四車、價漲五分、洋莊芝蔴因賣買兩擯、致未做開、聞行情尙未遠離、照結束時之十一元八角價、洋行有雷報發出、能否成交易、須看國外情形云、</p>

<h3>南北貨　金針菜突各升三四元</h3>
<p>金針菜近日以存底漸稀、趨勢大緊、昨晚聞有數十包、因貨主不肯多售、而行方進意頗濃、故開價突升三四元、今日行盤勢必再加、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經紅盤尙有所待</h3>
<p>因海外絲業市價續小、故本埠紅盤交易、似尙有所待、前日各出口行雖已照常辦公、然廠商咸欲略見彩頭而售貨、以故前日並無交易、</p>

<p>五金自經盤開出後、本埠印刷廠·製罐廠·香烟廠等等、因鑒於馬口鐵市勢之挺硬、多下手採辦、開出達七八百箱、惟市上流通貨愈少、故執貨者心思奇好、市盤益固、如美貨之一百磅雙連以斷擋關係、價已漲至五十二元、九十磅雙連亦以底存單薄、開價亦高至四十元、意德諸貨、亦以到貨不繼、市勢亦優、開價九十磅雙連意貨售三十七元五角、德貨三十六元五角、法貨因底存較夥、行情仍開三十五元、故前昨交易以此貨走勢為最爽、九十磅單連之英國貨、其新貨北蘇州路某五金號新到五百箱、價開十七元五角、聞已拋出二百餘箱、客路如津·烟·靑·徐·各帮昨市亦多問津、此外各馬口鐵、昨亦頗有活動氣象云、</p>

<h3>黑格爾論中國歷史</h3>
<p>— 李建芳</p>
<p>為近代歷史哲學之靈魂的黑格爾，他在他的大著歷史哲學中曾時時論到中國歷史。他雖是一個唯心哲人，對於中國的事實也有許多不了解的地方，但他對於中國歷史所給的某些批評和指示，則雖在現在也仍不失其重要性。</p>
<p>這篇小文的目的，旣不是要人們無條件的信服黑格爾對中國歷史的分析和議論，也不是要批評黑氏對中國歷史的分析和議論—皆不是，這篇小文的目的，只是想把這位偉大精深的哲人在他那時代對於我們的歷史所下的某些，雖在今日仍不矢其時效的意見摘要的寫在這裏，以供國人和歷史家之參考。我以為黑氏對中國民族的精神發展所下的某些批評確是我們這在老民族想認識自己時不可多得的指示。我們接受黑格爾這種指示比接受在骨子裏充滿民族偏見，但為某種原因或利益不惜對我們備極稱贊的國際上，一般來到中國走江湖的名人學者們，向我們說出許多廉價恭维话，要有意义得多。</p>
<p>閒話少說，現在就來把黑格爾對中國民族的意見簡短的加以叙途。</p>
<p>黑格爾把世界各民族活動的地盤分為三種：第一，是沒有河流灌溉的高地；第二，是河流灌溉的平原或盆地；第三，是沿海地帶。中國民族活動的地羅是屬於第二種。</p>
<p>地理關係有甚麽重要呢？不，黑格爾乃至馬克思却是非常重視歷史之地理因素的。因為中國民族活動的地盤是屬於第一類的，中國民族很早就食河流淤積之賜而開始他的文明活動。農業很快地就達到熟練程度，共同生活的法律制度也跟着出現。因為農業是重要「預計」的，科學和怪性也就同時出現。所以，在這裏很早便樹立起偉大的文明帝國。</p>
<p>雖然這個民族在極古時代就發生光輝燦爛的文化生活，但他却是局限於自己內部的。他與海的原理沒有交涉，至少在完成他的特有原理時，他不曾與海的原理交涉過。並且假如他與海的原理有過交涉，那這原理還不能做這民族的文化與敎育的因素。這只有在他自己被人訪問，被人探求場合，對於他才能有一種更進一步的歷史關係，所以，這種民族的精神生活達到一定高度時，如沒有外力的推動便裹足不前了。</p>
<p>但從一般的民族發達史說，人類的或民族的精神發展是與兒童的長成相類似的。兒童只在其身體和精神愈前進時，方能愈脫離對父母的依賴。而民族也只有在其精神愈達發揚時，他才能愈脫離自然的命令而進入自由之境。但假如這個民族的精神發展為其自然環境所局限時，這個民族雖有精神生活，但却不能說他是一個自由的民族。</p>
<p>按黑氏之意，人類精神發展可分為下之三階段：一精神沉潛於自然之階段；二精神雖脫離自然而入於意識，但因牠是直接自自然性生出來，因而與自然有關係，對自然負有要素的義務之不完全自由階段了；三精神之純粹自由和普遍自由階段。中國民族的精神生活始終是處於第一階段的。因此，不管這個民族，過去出過多少偉人賢哲，然而在中國人，他們的道德上的各種規律和自然法則一樣，都是外部的實證命令之結果，強制的權利與強制的義務，或彼此間的禮儀的規定，並且人倫心術之自由，在這個民族內是完全缺乏的。道德為國家的事務並且由政府和法官來執行。一個抽象的主觀意象，即賢人和聖人的意象，在中國成為一種學說和思想的頂點。所以×在這個民族內，儘管他有反省的哲為和藝術等，但他却不能把牠們提高到自然的主人地位，總是在自然的奴隸地位。</p>
<p>這是我摘錄黑格爾在一百多年前對中國民族的批評，我不知道我們這不長進的民族在這長時期之內並且特別是在現在是否在實際上改變過黑格爾對我們弱點的批評和指示和是否使黑格爾對我們的批評和指示失去時效？</p>
<p>但是，這還不足長。下面更有可怕的指示！只要這個平原的民族是安於現狀的，這個民族就非不斷的趨於死滅不可。死滅之原因有二：一是因內在的要求之滿足和精神之枯絕而招來的設施停止和政治失效，一是高原的遊牧民族和海外來的商業民族之入寇。中國在鴉片戰爭以前的外患是前者，在鴉片戰爭以後的外患是後者。自然，後者比前者更厲害。</p>
<p>由於滿足現狀，這個民族在多方面便斷了念頭，他已墮落在無生氣的習慣之內，並且趨向於自然的死亡。他雖然還能長期過着沉淪生活，但這種活氣只是各個人之特殊關心的活氣，已不再是民族的活氣。因此，這個民族其應受災害，其應受奴隸，就不可避免了。每一次歷史的大災害來到之後，在過去總要經數十年甚至數百年才能再由死中復生。而新的復生至一定限度時，一個可怕死亡又重新開始。</p>
<p>換句話，中國的民族史，是郭沫若的「鳳湼槃」篇；</p>
<p>天色昏黃了，</p>
<p>香木集高了，</p>
<p>鳳已飛倦了，</p>
<p>凰已飛倦了，</p>
<p>鳳啄香木，一星星的火點迸飛。</p>
<p>凰扇火星，一縷縷的香烟上騰。</p>
<p>鳳又啄，</p>
<p>凰又扇，</p>
<p>山上的香烟彌散，</p>
<p>山上的火光彌滿。</p>
<p>足！足！足！</p>
<p>五百年來的眼淚傾瀉如瀑，</p>
<p>五百年來的眼淚淋漓如燭！</p>
<p>春潮漲了，</p>
<p>春潮漲了，</p>
<p>死了的宇宙更生了！</p>
<p>雖然牠更生了，雖然牠更生了，但因為牠不能於西方的各民族歷史一樣，不能從反老還童之中，加工牠自己改造牠自己，並傾全力昇華牠自己，所以不久，又只好重歌詩人的「鳳凰湼槃」草。中國民族的精神生活在過去從沒有走出過這輪　圈子之外。這就是黑格爾對中國歷史的認識。這也可以說是這位偉大唯心哲人對我們的策勸！</p>
<h3>論潔本小說</h3>
<p>— 蔣鏞</p>
<p>最近開明書店出版了幾種舊小說的刪節本，名之曰潔本小說，意思是把原書的「糟粕」成分刪去了，而專留下些「精英」，這樣，原書便很「淸潔」，適合於靑年的閱讀了。其實，有許多地方還是須待考慮的。</p>
<p>讀書小說，最重要的是能夠了解作者的全人格，思想，和他處的時代；其次才到小說的內容。至於情節的趣味和文辭的修練該是次要的事。如果我們所需要的祗是情節的趣味的「精英」，則讀小說專事追求趣味的態度實在是不可取的；如果說我們所需要的祗是文辭的修練「精英」，則似乎是要把舊小說來做靑年的語文科的範本，而不應該把舊小說來做範本是成問題的，舊小說能不能夠做現代文的範本也是成問題的；如果要用刪節本來表現作者的全人格，思想，和他所處的時代，則無疑地原本要比刪節本表現得更完全。故潔本小說，倒底是否是眞適宜於靑年的閱讀是問題。</p>
<p>說到靑年課外閱讀的時間問題，則潔本小說並不見得會幫助多少。因為潔本小說不能使人得到完全的滿足，則讀者在讀了潔本小說之後，勢必一定要進一步再去尋讀原本，這一方面是基於讀者的進取和好奇心理要求完全的滿足，一方面我們也確信得在紅樓夢，水滸和三國誌這三部書的本身裏也確具有這種魔力，故本小說云者，其實是祗叫靑年多讀一遍潔本而已，這在時間上是祗有增多沒有减少的。</p>
<p>於是剩下未便還祗有一個理由：潔本小說經過刪節而比較「淸潔」的。接着，我們便覺得在開明已出的三種潔本小說的原，都是流傳得極廣的盡人皆知的小說：智識靑年，知道决擇較易，要使潔本小說流傳到一般社會去，却是絕不可能做到的事。諸葛亮借東風，石碣上刻定的天星地煞，通靈石在托生寳玉之類的迷信傳說，絕不會因原本上刋着而影響靑年的思想，因為課本上灌輸的科學知識已足使靑年們明確地認識；而其餘，刪節了的，靑年還是可從原本上得到的。又如西游記一書也是流傳極廣的舊小說，它的文筆恣暢而活潑，情節亦僥於趣味。然而刪節者將何從入手呢？因無從入手固不妨不列入潔本小說之內，然而西游記的廣大的讀者是决不會减少的。</p>
<p>所以，為實踐潔本小說的原來目的，要使讀者（不限定靑年）知道這小說的那一部分是該捨棄的「糟粕」，什麽是應該攝取的「精英」，而知所抉擇；則多出幾册舊小說讀法或小說鑑賞法，或「紅樓夢讀法」，「應該怎樣讀水滸」和「三國誌鑑賞法」等等，倒是比較實際的工作。不過一部書的出版，出版家是另有其生意眼的。</p>
<h3>評「科學生活」</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>出版者：南京中央大學科學生活月刋社。</p>
<p>在一切雜誌公司裏，很可以覺察雜誌界暴露了一種慘痛而無恥的動向：用電影明星，裸體照片的銅圖來吸引着一般過着悠閑生活的姐兒公子的讀者羣衆。出版家儘在賺錢的份上用功夫：一切導示文化的責任，倒是滿不在乎的。</p>
<p>要是有人做一下子統計：很可以跟每月脂粉進口的統計同樣的驚人：</p>
<p>「近身五尺，會令人傷風中鉛毒。」誰說低級趣味的毒不比鉛毒來得厲害呢。</p>
<p>辦枯燥的科學刋物，出版家是沒有這種勇氣的；無疑會虧本得一敗塗地；中央大學的幾位學生最近自掏腰包辦成了一種「科學生活」；委實是一種大膽的嘗試，（據說每期祗銷到三四百本。）我們除了用摯誠的態度來介紹這條脆弱的小生命外；並想於內容方面，作一次忠實的探檢；</p>
<p>此雜誌的程度率，適合於初中學生，內容均屬短篇，分為「科學論壇」，「科學時評」，「科學世界」；「科學知識」；「科學通訊」；「科學對話」；「科學動向」；「科學漫畫」；「珍聞隨鈔」等　種。</p>
<p>讀完了「科學生活」二册；很佩服中大學生努力的精神；同時理智　動着自己的判斷力！</p>
<p>發生着下面數點意見：</p>
<p>取材欠嚴肅——科學書籍的鵠的，以灌輸知識為先；空泛而人云亦云的，宜力求避免；如第二期「科學知識」欄里的無綫電普通原理；就是多餘的文字，以及「科學漫畫」一欄；過於無聊；一無眞確的指示。</p>
<p>介紹應增加——各種新發明物的形態，原理的介紹，寬付闕如，時代的科學就不需要消極的針砭，應着重於積極的探視。</p>
<p>無論如何，「科學生活」的同人的努力是可敬佩的，在這全國靑年躊躇徬徨的時代；我們企望着有一種嚴肅的學風來捲掃一切骯毒的俗霧。「科學生活」的動向乃是我們所期待着的。</p>
<h3>介紹一部中國工學文具書（下）</h3>
<p>— 鍾怡</p>
<p>文學產品——這裏面又分已知作年和未詳作年兩格，表明作品產生的時代關係。</p>
<p>備註——這是做證據材料的附錄。</p>
<p>此外在書的肩頭上，更引各史書食貨志，以見當時社會情形。這結合史實·年代·文學產品·作家生卒成功一個大組織，實在是一個創舉，而且是本書的惟一特色。</p>
<p>這本書的優點很多，我現在舉他重要的來說：</p>
<p>搜羅廣闊：他在凡例上說：</p>
<p>「關於各時代文學作品——詩·賦·詞·曲·小說——有見必收，故作者之去取，亦以有文學作品流傳於今日者為定。但如陸賈·枚皋等，雖為遺編可考，然其於文學上之地位，實有不可泯滅者；附載其傳，以明因革。」從這一點上看，就可以知道他所收的作家之多。决無成見或者派別的分別，實在是史家應有的態度，非他書所能及。</p>
<p>取材嚴密：他這書的取材，完全以文字學為中心；所以他所載的時事，多詳於社會方面，如戰爭·飢荒·移民等；所載作家小傳，也偏於品性和環境方面，而對於官職的遷動，很少說明；這一點也是他的特點，使我們不能不佩服他取材的謹愼和嚴密。再者年代不可考的，用一個「疑」字注在下面，這更是「其所不知，蓋闕如也」的古義，不像近人的好牽強武斷。</p>
<p>備注精確：這是本書的又一特點。我們從他的備註裏面，可以得到許多材料和有力的證明。就拿第一頁屈原來說，他在「作者生」一欄裏說：「原之生也，當在戊寅之歲。」並沒提出有力的證據；可是他在備註裏，引疑年錄來證明，就使得他前面的話有根據了。其他選載關於文學評話，如第一册頁三引柳子厚云云，頁三十四引方以智詩說云云，第三册頁三十四引顏民家訓竹林詩評云云，很多很多；極有幫助於我們硏究文學時的參考。</p>
<p>眉注周詳：眉注所引，都是各史書食貨志；他按着年代分別的引出；這於硏究文學產生背景時，極有幫助。也是本書的一特點。</p>
<p>以上所說，都是犖犖大者。其他譬如第四册附有的作家產生地域圖和表以及姓氏檢目，這都是給閱者以極大的便利的。</p>
<p>不過，這一部書，也不是一點沒有可以商討的地方的。個人以為在公暦一欄以下，應當添一甲子欄，因中國古時紀事，常有旣不寫朝代又不寫年數而僅寫甲子的；這一點似不能不特地注明。還有年代與年代之間，似乎也應當加一隔綫，以醒眉目；至於多費一點紙，那到顧不了許多。這兩點很希望再版時，能有增改。</p>
<p>總之，這是一部値得我們介紹的文學工具書。可惜現在才出了第一編；據作者說，還有五編未出，個人希望他能夠早早出來，以供給這飢荒的出版界。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>帝國主義的眞面目</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>帝國主義和弱小民族，兩方的利害永遠是相衝突的。世界一天有帝國主義存在，弱小民族便一天難以抬頭。這决東菲之戰，英法二國，表面上好像很能為阿比西尼亞出力，實際却完全是替本身的利益打算。看他們在國聯一會倡議制裁一會又主張分割，便知道其用意所在。且近日據巴黎傳來消息，列强對於意阿戰爭的前途，均以為萬一菲洲民族，得以戰勝歐洲一强國，則不獨歐洲列强的均勢，將被牽動，卽各殖民地的和平與秩序感受危險。故現要由國聯組織調查委員會，派往阿國，實地調查戰爭狀況，再乘機擬一和平方案，呈交國聯，以謀意阿問題和解。這項和平方案，一面固應重視意大利的需要，一面亦應肯定歐洲協助阿國，同時，倫敦亦傳英國政府現欲設法使東菲戰事儘速結束，這其用意，非盡爲謀國聯政策的成功，實爲顧全意大利，緣在不久的將來，意國或將成爲維持歐洲均勢的重要因索，自未可再任其爲殖民地事件，而耗損經濟和軍事的實力。</p>
<p>意大利獨佔阿此西尼亞，自非列强所願意，但阿比西尼亞戰勝意大利，更非列强所喜歡。原因這次阿比西尼亞的勇敢抗敵，已引起全世界各弱小民族的興奮。將來阿比西尼亞果一旦戰騰歐洲的强國意大利，則各弱小民族必更增强他們的信心，向壓迫者作解放的鬥爭。這於帝國主義是不利的，會使它們不能高枕面臥。列强所以顧慮萬一菲洲民族，得以戰勝歐洲一強國，則不獨歐洲列強的均勢，將被牽動，卽各殖民地的和平興秩序，亦將感受危險，便是這個意思。故它們現時就要想出一和平方案，急謀意阿爭端的解决。</p>
<p>東菲戰爭，兩方相持至三個多月之久，最初意大利雖大獲勝利，近來財軍事進展很遲，且又屢吿失敗。一方意大利國內受國聯的制裁，經齊物質，亦甚感困迫。况現在雨季已臨，行軍更屬阻碍重重，戰事前途，意大利實難有必勝的把握。因是意大利對東菲糾紛的態度，近已有變更的徵象。據日內瓦所傳消息，謂現有理由可信如有任何實際的和平建議於今日提出，則必受羅馬與數星期前逈不相同的待遇，惟何人倡議，實爲難决的問題，由這一點我們便可以看出意大利最近的氣燄，已不如往日之盛。同時也可以明白列強欲對意阿事件迅</p>
<p>帝國主義所依賴以喘息生存的，是殖民地，若各殖民地的和平與秩序，一發生動搖，自非它們之福。故列强一看見東菲戰事已閙成僵局，便覺惶惶不安，對殖民地下起關心來，急欲以和平的方法，使阿比西尼亞就範，以為鎭壓世界弱小民族之計。據可靠方面傳說，英國政界有勢力人士，頃向政府建議，擬由英國政府，發起召集一和平會議，俾得依照國聯盟的第十九條的規定，將若干種現行條約，從事修改，藉合意德二國，在領土經濟及殖民方面所懷的願望，可獲滿足。這是列強對世界殖民地的再分割，這事不久英國外交代表亦會在國聯說過，耍是將來這會議能實現，則弱小民族勢將再被列强擺布，聽任它們爭肥掠美。</p>
<p>分割世界弱小民族以維持本身的生存，這便是今日帝國主義的眞面目。弱小民族今後要解除列强壓迫的痛苦，惟一的出路，只有聯合成一陳綫，向它們作生死的抗爭。</p>
<h3>藥針房</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>回到故鄉的第二天，便到鎭西頭去看外祖母，她家院子空落落地沒一個人，沒一點動靜，我知道旁人都出了門，蹶子三舅也不會出去，就站在院中提高了嗓子嚷：</p>
<p>「三舅在家嗎？」</p>
<p>「呵，誰？」</p>
<p>「我，」</p>
<p>「大祥？進來吧，」</p>
<p>掀起麻包片門簾，我邁進屋里去，屋里仍是那麼暗沉沉的，像罩着一團濃黑的烟，三舅正立在桌台旁包藥，待他扭轉身來，向我笑着收拾了桌上的東西，一顚一蹶的搬着他那幹義和團時摔拆了的右腿，走到這沿邊坐下，指着那黃黃地發着潮濕氣的蓆子對我說：</p>
<p>「坐下，坐下你什麼時候家來的？」</p>
<p>因為在這里邊的那個窗子下，正有一個女人光着胳膊在給自己打瑪琲，我怕仿害她的光綫，便在靠鍋台的一邊坐下，她左手食指跟中指挾住針筒，姆指顫顫哆哆的向下壓擠着那藥水，針頭啃着散滿紫色斑點的右胳膊，那地方順着筒里的藥水慢慢减少，肉皮便漸漸鼓漲起，成了一顆半片蠶豆形的　疽，管子越來越空了。她趕快把針放下，使手　輕搔着那財滿瑪琲汁的胞，盤着的腿試騐着一點點伸開，渾身晃搖兩下，手仍是不停的揉搓着，過了一陣，她瞇上眼晴，背抵着墻，便沉醉得不動了。</p>
<p>三舅把針拿過來，在化藥的小酒盅里注滿了水，使針頭抵住盅底，他右手握着管子，左手大姆指和食指揑住「壓管」向回抽，到管子吸足了白水，他便斜舉起針來向窗紙射去，窗紙輕輕發出一片響聲，我不由的想起這根玲瓏的小一水管雖不如都市上自來水寵頭粗野，容易激的學子們昏倒，可是在我們的同胞中，也正有很多千方百計的弄點錢，來買這根小毒水管子注射自己，一直昏迷，麻痺，緩緩腐潰到死。</p>
<p>舅父年靑的時候是個靈利且有本領的漢子，三十多歲時在關外為一個女人使刀子通倒了個情敵，便不得不拋了愛人跑回家來，因為帶來了點錢，回到故鄉便跟鎭上一個花烟館的姑娘姘上，以後學上扎瑪琲，一天就比一天窮了。那姑娘也跟了另一個人去，他知道自已吃了虧，就從吃虧里悟出來份本領，在自已家中也開了間藥針房，他整天不出屋，每日賺的够自已吃飯過癮了，就滿足的混着日子。</p>
<p>他看我半天想不起話來，骨魯着那眼白非常大的眼珠子喘了口氣說：</p>
<p>「關外這當兒是屬宣統管，是屬　　管？」</p>
<p>「屬　　，宣統是個哄人的榥子！」</p>
<p>他沒留心聽我的話，却想起他在關外的那些事來，就止不住的一述串講着：關外的雪有多麼厚，人們都穿着胡拉草的鞋矛過冬，哈爾濱不知那來的那些洋婊子，那地方有多麼富，高梁利子比小蒲扇大，簡直洋錢可以着箥箕收，說到末了，便興奮的拉到他那件光榮的而感慨的事上：</p>
<p>「要不着殺死那王八羔子，我怎麼也不回來，也弄不上這他媽倒霉玩意，」</p>
<p>一邊說着，一邊小心的將藥針放到蓆上，這時那女人爬下　來，她掏給了舅父三塊錢的票子，把桌上包好的五個小紙包握在掌心里，便沙拉沙拉的兩隻尖脚拖着雙破男人鞋走出屋去，舅父兩手張着鈔票對着窗紙照那些花紋，看完兩張，最末那張河北省銀行的照了又照，顯得很不放心，我探過頭去看了看說</p>
<p>「怎麼？」</p>
<p>「縣里有　　人賣假河北省票子，化三十塊錢可以買一百塊錢的，賣買不好再使他媽張假的就毀啦！」</p>
<p>「怎麼看的出來？」</p>
<p>他指給我看那灰色的圈里道：</p>
<p>「你看，這兒有座暗塔，假的就沒有，」</p>
<p>我佩服舅父的這份聰明，却也覺得奇怪的是：以前像剛出去的這樣照顧主，至多買兩吊錢的，現在一下就是三塊洋，舅父倒說賣買不好，就不相信的悶着。）</p>
<p>「賣買還不好？」</p>
<p>「呵，」他把腿帶解開，將三張鈔票放在襪筒里，又用帶子緊　的緾好，便說：「你還不知道，咱爺們不走運就是拉，徠水，涿州，好幾縣都有招自治軍的，雖說是暗着，比明的膽子都大，那里頭發餉不只給錢，還給瑪瑪琲，四鄉左近有癮的全投了去，我還賣誰的錢？剛才出去的這個娘們，她男人就在涿州郭大禿子司令部里！她說　　人給運了一汽車瑪琲來，大祥，你說那得多少錢？還發白面，（海羅美）說佔了涿州城人發一兩，瑪琲白面隨你檢，唉，」他冷一下拍着他拆了的腿，「要不着這個孽障東西，咱爺們不得弄個排連長當當！」</p>
<p>他廋稜稜的黃檢上，漸漸着紅色人是有點憤恨命運，却也有點感旣，也從　頭的小白鐵　里拈出小小的一個紙包來，抖到酒盅里，使針由茶杯里及足了水，激筒般的射着那白光閃閃的粉末，他又要打針了。我便吿訴他要到北屋看外祖母回來了沒有。</p>
<p>他點頭笑了笑，便剝起褲管，露出他那瘦瘦的乾癟腿子，我低着頭走了出來。</p>
<h3>砲樓上</h3>
<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>一旦在鄉間住上了三四天，心頭就漸漸覺得厭倦起來，何况整天困在砲樓裹，活活的替這批南貨做活土地，越發使人感到不耐煩而枯燥：有時在極無聊的時候，只好在侷促的樓上唱唱小調，來解除積鬱的悶氣，不然，就索性和衣來睏他媽的一大覺，只要老閻不在家裏，怎麼胡鬧也沒人管得着。反正胡大頭也把我們待得客客氣氣，自然更不會來理會，我們這幾位粗獷的傢伙。</p>
<p>夜裏，老閻不知鬼混到什麼地方去了。一直到天亮還不見歸來，我們睡得很早，把槍桿兒倚在床邊，以防夜裹萬一有什麼事。剛睡下床不久，老宋斗的就從床上爬了起來，好像觸起了日麼心事。我在床上反轉身來，看他有日麼動靜。他走到桌子那邊去斟了一杯茶，把洋汕燈弄得亮了一點，就在桌子旁邊的椅子上坐下了。他喝了一口茶，回頭看見我正睜大眼睛朝他望，他笑了笑：「小莊，你也還沒有　着嗎」？我點點頭，他於是就走近床前來，呻了一口氣：「整天困在這裹眞要悶死，白天睏得多了，夜裹，就睡不着，眞苦……媽的，老子打算明天到外邊去舒一口氣，你想怎麼若？大家輪流換換班，不要弄得大家都鬱悶得要死……」我眼睛盯着他那圓渾渾的眼珠子，和那粗大的眉毛，點着頭表示同意。</p>
<p>他沒有留心到我對於他的注視，陰鬱地抬起了頭，從袋裏掏出了一包香烟，是蹩脚的土貨。順便抽了兩口出來，遞一口給我，轉身到洋油燈那邊去把香烟燃着了，然後又沉沉地陷進沉思裏。我覺得老宋今晚的神情有點怪，然而又不便向他探聽些日麼話：話傢伙挺聽明，不容易在別人面前透露他自己的心事。於是我只好黔不做聲，讓可怕的靜默佔據了這個陰沉的世界。</p>
<p>老宋沉思了一會，漸漸也好像想起了我對他的注意，回頭朝我恍了一下子，立刻就拍拍我的肩背：「小莊，你付了銅鈿回家過年了沒有？過年，唉，眞是不容易的，這是一個關口，幾乎就像是個生死關頭似的！沒錢的眞不容易度過。你記得從前跟我們在一道的在炳麼？他就是因為過不得年關才尋死的！我眞擔心，——」他突然像憶起了些什麼，說到活裏就歇住了。望望我看他的臉色，躊躇地，像想說又不能說似的。我也知道他有莫大的隱痛，然而他素來是個極端能忍耐，能自制的人，什麼事都永遠藏在心裏頭裹；也就為了如此，所以他永遠是蘊藏着無限的苦痛和悲鬱。往往在一種可怕的靜默裏，他寥廓的心田也就常常和這悲苦的忍耐抗戰起來；像這樣的情形，我每每可以從他苦難的神色上看得出來的，而今晚，也正是一個很好的例子。……</p>
<p>我看着他底躊躇的神氣，心裹很有點難過，猛的就從被窩裏伸了手，一把抓住老宋的臂膀，眼睛盯着他陰沉的臉，抑鬱地說：「老宋，難道你連我也不相信嗎？每决看到你想說而又中止，可是肚子裏却老是滿肚心事。這樣的情形，我看得太多了，你老是不肯說，我自然了解你的苦處，可是，我們已經相好了話麼多年頭，還分什麼彼此！老實說，老宋，我一看到你躊躇得那麼樣，我就很有點難過。我想你一定不大相信我的！」……</p>
<p>他發熱的兩眼朝我望望，搖了搖頭，然後又回轉身去，用着帶啞的嗓子說：「小莊，我相信你！但是我沒有什麼好對你說，我心裏着實太難過了。我威逼過人，甚至我也同樣在徐老板的威勢下逼過自己的伙伴。想起來眞難過！假如不是我，替徐老板催賬催得那麼兇，老汪就决不會尋死！一想起他，這個結實的老伴，我眞痛楚極了！我為什麼要兇成這樣子呢？……今年家裏來信，說年關不易過，我眞擔心，年老的父親會耐不住而走上老在這條路！……」他不再說下去了，我發現他的眼眶裏含着晶瑩的淚水。</p>
<p>沉默了一會，他又拍拍我的肩背說：「唉，小莊，吃這口飯眞難，是死路，一輩子也沒出息，沒好處！我做錯的事太多了小以前年紀輕，沒主見，憑一時的氣盛，就上了人家的大當！現在想來眞後悔！……」</p>
<p>我沒話好說了，想不到我這幾句話居然會使平日少說的老宋這末大發傷感起來。我看他的悲鬰好像會更擴展下去，不得不勸慰了他一下子。而狗正就在這時狂吠了起來，大家驚駭了一下，聽聽村外好像有脚步聲，而且四更的竹拆聲也饗了。漸漸，夜又在沉默着。</p>

<h3>Selection of Sino-Japanese Ambassadors: Both Sides Agree – Official Announcement Soon – Ariyoshi Called at the Foreign Ministry Yesterday to Bid Farewell – The National Government Awards Ariyoshi a Medal</h3>

<h3>Prince De Assembles Subordinates for Discussions on Mongolian Affairs</h3>
<p>Following the National Government's explicit order to establish the Autonomous Political Committee for Leagues and Banners in Suiyuan Territory, appointing Shakdurjab as chairman, according to information from Mongolian residents in Beiping, Shak has telegraphed the central government expressing his humility.

<h3>The Hebei-Chahar Incident: Negotiations Face Complexity and Difficulty – Doihara Meets with Visitors at the Tokiwa Hotel in Tianjin Every Day – Some Parties Demand Further Demonstrations from the Hebei-Chahar Authorities</h3>
<p>Every day in Tianjin, Doihara meets with Chinese individuals at the Tokiwa Hotel. In recent days, people from all over have traveled great distances to visit, and some who could not secure a meeting left written proposals. Some parties believe that the abolition of the Jidong organization is already an open demonstration and demand that the Hebei-Chahar Standing Committee take a further step, reaching a point where autonomy is both formal and substantial. The daily revenue of one million yuan from customs duties in North China is to be entirely withheld, and the consolidated tax, salt tax, and tobacco and alcohol taxes must not be remitted to Nanjing. Postal, telegraph, aviation rights, and railways must also be autonomous. If there are difficulties, or if there is a deficit after independence, some parties are determined to provide assistance. Furthermore, local councils must be established in the cities and counties of Hebei and Chahar provinces, and autonomy movement figures must be elected as councilors to oversee the progress of Hebei-Chahar affairs. Once all of this is realized, some parties will order the abolition of the Jidong government to unify Hebei-Chahar administration. Those responsible for negotiation have reported to the Hebei-Chahar authorities that the future of negotiations is extremely complex and difficult. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Sources from the Beiping side received a telegram from Tianjin stating that Doihara was still in Tianjin as of last night before heading north, and rumors of a trip to Taiyuan are unreliable. Cheng Xihou, special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Beiping, has not received any telegram invitations from any parties recently, so he has not made any preparations for a long journey. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>The diplomatic issue of Hebei-Chahar in Beiping is still ongoing. It is said that Doihara is still in Tianjin. According to relevant authorities, the current diplomatic situation is temporarily stabilizing. There is still no solution to the Jidong issue. In the Chahar area, the puppet army of Li Shouxin has occupied six counties and established a temporary military government in Zhangbei, replacing the county magistrates of Zhangbei, Guyuan, and other six counties. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Sources in Beiping claim that the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations will continue in Tianjin. Qin Dechun went to Tianjin at the invitation of Song Zheyuan to participate in the discussions. The Hebei-Chahar issue has recently encountered repeated setbacks, so it is difficult to predict whether a result can be achieved soon. Recent rumors that Doihara has gone to Taiyuan have not been confirmed here. As for the rumors that Yan Xishan telegraphed Cheng Xigeng to go to Taiyuan to negotiate with the Japanese side, Cheng stated that it is absolutely not true, and the central government has no such intention. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>According to a responsible person from the Chahar provincial government in Zhangjiakou, Zhang Zizhong is now completely obedient to the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee for negotiations on the Chahar issue. This area has not received any orders from the central government, and Feng Yuxiang has not sent anyone to Chahar. The situation in Zhangyuan is as peaceful as usual. The report in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 25th is completely fictitious. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Current Status of Customs and Salt Tax Revenue in the Jidong Area</h3>
<p>The Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs Office stated that the customs revenue situation at the various ports of Qinhuangdao Customs, the Great Wall, and the tax checkpoints of Tianjin Customs are as usual. The puppet Jidong government has not intercepted anything. The revenue from various customs offices is deposited in the Central Bank and remitted to the central government. Although some parties have repeatedly spread news of customs duties being withheld, their intention is to create a fait accompli through rumors, but they fear that it will not be as easy as they expect. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>According to sources from the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office in Tianjin, the puppet Jidong government had set up new lead wharves in the Tanggu and Lutai salt flats and planned to collect salt taxes. After negotiations, the puppet side has removed them, and the salt industry can freely transport and sell salt. The monthly income from the Changlu salt tax, after deducting the collateral for various loans and public bonds, is still deposited in the Central Bank and remitted to the central government. The surplus is remitted to the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee for the administrative expenses of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee and the expenses of various military forces. This matter has been approved by the central government. As for the matter of remitting 250,000 yuan to the Jidong government each month, the Changlu Transport Commissioner's Office has not yet received an order as of now.

The Guangxi Provincial Party Headquarters also sent a similar telegram to Hu. Zhang Renmin, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Group Army, said that after Hu received the telegram from Li and Bai, he felt unwell, and the central government repeatedly telegraphed urging him to come to Nanjing, so his trip to Guangxi is still undecided.

<p>Guangzhou According to official news today, the Guangxi leaders are now planning to invite Hu to visit Nanning.

<p>Guangzhou Officials claim that Hu Hanmin's blood pressure was 180 this afternoon. Doctors advised him to rest, so Xiao Focheng's scheduled meeting with Hu this afternoon has been canceled. It is said that Hu has not yet decided on his trip to Nanning. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Clash Between Changping Militia and Security Forces – Ceasefire After Mediation</h3>
<p>Tianjin The newly organized militia of Luan County in the puppet Jidong area, led by Xiao Zaixing, moved into Changping County, intending to occupy the defense area of Feng Shoupeng, the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Security Regiment. A clash occurred on the morning of the 27th. The security team tightly closed the city gates, preventing entry and exit. The militia attacked from the outside, resulting in several hours of fierce fighting. Local gentry pleaded earnestly, and both sides ceased fire. The militia retreated to the vicinity of the Ming Tombs. The puppet Jidong government dispatched Li Yunsheng, the commander of the 5th Security Regiment, to investigate. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Beiping Since Changping was forcibly placed under the jurisdiction of the Jidong area, Feng Shoupeng's troops of the war zone security team entered the county from outside the Great Wall and stationed in the city, and the local order was generally peaceful. On the 27th of this month, suddenly thousands of armed militia from the county demanded to enter the city, but Feng's troops refused, and both sides opened fire immediately. All city gates were tightly closed that night, and the situation was tense. The conflict only stopped last night. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. Most of the militia are still gathered at a certain location not far from the city. The city is tightening its guard, and the security team's defenses have not slackened. The people are extremely panicked, and the situation is quite chaotic. The county is a defense area of a certain unit of Liu Ruming's division. In addition to sentries on guard, they also telegraphed Pingjin, requesting instructions on how to respond. (Special dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Beiping Changping, 20 miles north of Beiping, was occupied today by about 1,000 bandits. The area is within the Jidong Autonomous Region. It is said that the bandits first planned to invade the territory under the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, but were blocked by Song Zheyuan's troops. The bandits then turned to Changping, and the Jidong militia was unable to resist. Changping fell to the bandits. Communication between here and Changping has now been interrupted, so the situation is unclear, but Yin Rugeng told the Japanese today that he will send more militia to retake Changping soon.

<h3>Contradictory Phenomena in the International Arena</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>The greatest obstacle to international peace today is none other than the insatiable territorial desires and aggressive actions of ambitious nations. However, the most disappointing thing is that there is no consistent and thorough approach or action in the international community to deal with such destructive armed behavior that damages international peace. Since the end of the Great War, informed people in the international community have generally known that war is dangerous and perilous. Although the losers suffer immense pain that cannot be described, the victors are also exhausted and find recovery difficult. Therefore, the demand for peace is even more urgent. The first manifestation of this in reality was the conclusion of the League of Nations Covenant, followed by the establishment of the Pact of Paris (Kellogg-Briand Pact). Among the two, the League of Nations Covenant is considered to have practical effect, as Article 16 provides for sanctions against aggressors. Based on this, it can be seen that the world's statesmen have made great efforts to maintain international peace. However, what reality shows us is that if there is only a covenant to maintain international peace but no consistent determination and action to maintain peace, then war and aggression will never be eliminated.</p>
<p>Looking at the evolution of international affairs in the past three to five years, although the number of countries that undermine world peace is small and the number of countries that maintain international peace is large, the reason why the forces of peace have ultimately failed to overcome the forces of war is that peace-loving countries cannot have a real determination to uphold peace and reject aggression, nor can they have a consistent action to achieve this goal. For example, if the League of Nations, with strong countries such as Britain and France as its backbone, could impose sanctions on aggressors in the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident), and if the United States, the initiator of the Pact of Paris, could further provide practical support, then the situation in the Far East would naturally be greatly changed. At the same time, if the League of Nations had this example of punishing warmongering countries, its prestige would certainly be greater than it is today. Even the Italian aggression against Abyssinia might not have broken out. It was precisely because Italy saw the League of Nations' inability to sanction Japan that it dared to risk the world's disapproval and follow in Japan's footsteps. Therefore, peace today is holistic. If the goal of peace cannot be thoroughly understood in a certain region, and one tries to maintain its security elsewhere, it is bound to be impossible. Once a bad precedent is set, countries with similar ambitions will follow suit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current Italo-Ethiopian dispute is another major test of whether the League of Nations can fulfill its functions and establish its prestige. The success or failure of this test depends entirely on whether the countries that have always claimed to uphold the League of Nations have the determination to implement the principles of the League of Nations. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the international community has unanimously condemned Italy's actions, and Britain's attitude towards Italy has been firm. The League of Nations also passed economic sanctions in November last year. At that time, many commentators said that if the League of Nations and the powerful countries that supported it could consistently achieve their goal of subduing the aggressor, it might not be a way to revive the prestige of the League of Nations. If it could also apply what was applied to Italy to the Far East, then its contribution to the re-establishment of world peace would be significant. Unfortunately, the reality in the international community is unsatisfactory. On the one hand, at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian war, the disagreement between Britain and France prevented them from curbing Italy's ambitions early and eliminating the war in its infancy. Even after the outbreak of the war, the League of Nations could only pass mild sanctions because the interests of the two countries were different. As a result, Italy's brutal war against Abyssinia could still proceed without obstruction. However, the creation of this situation can be said to be due to the disharmony between Britain and France. Only until recently has the situation changed. Britain and France have fully cooperated in the military field. In theory, sanctions against Italy could be strong and effective. However, in reality, Britain and France have concerns. If Italy fails greatly, it may endanger the balance of power in Europe, and the colored races in the colonies may rise up in revolt against white rule. Therefore, the oil embargo, which was planned long ago, has been delayed until now and is still shelved. The fact that incomplete sanctions at present cannot curb aggressive actions is already obvious and undeniable. If one wants the authority of the League of Nations to be restored and world peace to be established in this way, how can it be achieved?</p>
<p>As for the Far East, the country that is constantly being invaded by Japan is China, the country that is constantly being threatened by Japan is Soviet Russia, and the countries that are affected by Japan's continental policy are the powerful countries of Britain and the United States. However, in reality, Soviet Russia and China are restrained by their respective situations and cannot join hands. Britain and the United States also need to cooperate in the Far East to subdue Japan. However, in reality, the two countries are competing for world economic hegemony and have no hope of cooperation. With so many contradictions, it is impossible to curb the actions of aggressor countries and eliminate their arrogance. Therefore, the chaos in the world today is caused by the cowardly policies of politicians in various countries who seek only to maintain the status quo and avoid trouble. If they continue in this way without thorough reform, the outbreak of a world war will be a matter of time.</p>

<h3>British and French Authorities in London Discuss Current Situation in Europe, Germany Plans to Restore Armaments in the Rhineland, France Feels Threatened and Seeks Help from Britain</h3>
<p>Paris - The Associated Press learned today that French Foreign Minister Flandin, who is currently in London to attend the funeral of the late British King George, took the opportunity to discuss with British Foreign Secretary Eden the issue of the demilitarized Rhineland area stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. According to well-informed sources, Flandin also plans to meet with British Prime Minister Baldwin and discuss the London Naval Conference, which is currently suspended. The meeting between Flandin and Eden on the eve of the funeral shows that they attach great importance to the political situation in the Rhineland. German newspapers have recently been making great efforts to promote the rearmament of the area. It is also learned that French Ambassador to Germany François-Poncet has formally reported to the French government that, judging from the general trend, Germany will take the opportunity to boast its military strength in the Rhineland on the occasion of the third anniversary of the establishment of the German Nazi government next Thursday. The French side is also deeply afraid that German leader Hitler will take this opportunity to once again abandon the Treaty of Versailles. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris - According to a diplomatic correspondent for the Journal, although Britain believes that there is no immediate danger regarding Germany's plan to re-establish defenses in the demilitarized zone on the banks of the Rhine, it is prepared to assist France's policy of preventative preparedness. Belgium, which is also dependent on France, is likely to sympathize with this policy. It is also said that former Prime Minister Laval, fearing that the Rhineland would be threatened by Germany, contacted Rome before resigning and inquired whether Italy was still prepared to fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Treaties while fighting in Abyssinia. The Italian government immediately stated that the number of troops sent by the country to East Africa was only seven divisions. If Germany violated the clause in the treaty that prohibited the establishment of defenses in the Rhineland, Italian forces would be sufficient to deal with the situation. The only concern was the lack of financial resources. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London - French Foreign Minister Flandin recently returned here from Windsor Castle and made a statement to a reporter from this agency, saying, "I came here only to attend the funeral of the late British monarch. Although I had talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden, it was only a casual visit. When we reminisced about the past, we also took the opportunity to discuss various external issues related to the two countries.

Flandin had already discussed this issue with Runciman last year when he was Prime Minister of France, but today's talks were only informal.

(28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London - Foreign sources say that France will issue public bonds in London. Financial figures in the British capital believe that this is premature and will not be realized at least until the French Sarraut Cabinet gains the trust of the Chamber of Deputies.

It is said that French Foreign Minister Flandin may have discussed this matter with Minister of Commerce Runciman this afternoon. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Reopened Four-Power Naval Conference Holds More Hope for an Early Compromise, Drafting of Warship Notification Plan Completed, Qualitative Restrictions to be Discussed Soon</h3>
<p>London - The naval conference reopened today with more hope for an early compromise than before, because the representatives have become more intimate during the recess, especially the British and American representatives. The technical committee that is planning to exchange details of warship construction plans completed its draft this morning, stipulating that signatory countries must, within the first four months of the year, notify of warships they intend to build within four months after the issuance of the notification. When the committee meets this afternoon, it will begin to handle qualitative restrictions. It will reduce the tonnage of battleships to 34,000 tons and the caliber of guns to 14 inches based on previous talks. Currently, battleships are 35,000 tons and the caliber of guns is 16 inches. It is said that Britain, France, and Italy are all willing to reduce the tonnage of battleships and the caliber of guns even further than this, but the United States does not agree. Regarding cruisers, France and Italy agree with Britain's proposal to reduce the tonnage of cruisers from 10,000 tons to 7,500 tons and the caliber of guns from 8 inches to 6 inches. There is hope for a compromise solution on this matter. The third issue involves the stage of inviting other countries such as Germany and Russia to participate in the discussion. The British representative believes that it is better to invite other countries to participate in the discussion before deciding on the final draft. However, the French representative believes that it is only necessary to ask other countries to sign. It is said that the French signature may be attached to the condition that Germany must also sign. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Right Wing of Italian Northern Army Repeatedly Attacked by Abyssinian Army, Mussolini Sends Telegram of Commendation to Front, Safe Turn of Events</h3>
<p>Rome - The right wing of the Italian army in the Danbian area of northern Abyssinia has recently been repeatedly attacked by the Abyssinian army. Fortunately, Italian East Africa High Commissioner and Front Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio was able to deploy troops effectively and defeat the Abyssinian army. Upon receiving the good news, Prime Minister Mussolini deeply praised the general and sent him a telegram of congratulations. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome - According to the latest news from the southern front in Qianjili, the number of Abyssinian soldiers killed and captured is over 5,000. In other words, General Tafari's initial offensive power has now been lost by more than half. Italian officials say that a branch of the Italian army that has reached Magamuli has twice driven back remnants of the Abyssinian army who were trying to reach the Wabama River. A total of 550 Abyssinian soldiers were killed, and the rest fled upstream to Natalduria, intending to join forces with the Abyssinian army stationed in Immi. However, this Italian army has occupied Bond and now occupies two-thirds of the main road from Dulo to Lentulo, so it can intercept fleeing soldiers. At the same time, the Italian army is currently advancing on towns outside of Bond. Another branch of the Italian army is currently protecting the right flank of the Italian army to prevent the Abyssinian army from attacking from the Immi side. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Denies Italian Reports</h3>
<p>The Abyssinian Emperor today issued a statement from the Western Front Headquarters, stating that the Italian army had been defeated and retreated in the northern region and near Wogaden, which they had already admitted without hesitation. The Italian people were thus discouraged. The Italian authorities, seeing the need to boost morale, falsely claimed great victories for the Italian army in the Magal area of the northern front and the Qianni Jili area of the southern front. In reality, Abyssinian General Taixi had not suffered any setbacks in the Qianni area but had withdrawn his troops stationed on the plains north of Doro to the mountains north of Ni Zhili, preventing the Italians from using tanks. The Abyssinian offensive northwest of Magal resulted in great losses for both sides, but after the Italian army was forced back, it abandoned its heavily fortified positions, which were then occupied by the Abyssinian army. The Italian army's claim of this as a great victory is inconsistent with the facts. Abyssinia frankly admits that the Italian army has superior equipment and a large air force, which greatly hindered the Abyssinian army. However, Abyssinia now knows how to avoid aerial attacks, and the morale of the Abyssinian army is currently excellent. The Abyssinian Emperor expressed regret over the repeated delays of the League of Nations' oil embargo and stated that the Paris peace plan was opposed by the whole world and that those who initiated it later withdrew from the international political stage, which shows that the world will never want to encourage Italy to violate its international obligations and attack weak countries again.

<h3>Confused News on Southern Front Situation</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - Our correspondent, Aochaina, reports that the government here has not made any announcements regarding the southern front situation, except to deny reports from the Italian side. Therefore, news about the southern front situation is very confused. It was recently widely rumored that General Mulu Guetai, the Minister of the Army who is currently commanding military operations on the northern front, has been ordered to transfer to the southern front to take over military affairs in the Sidamo area. However, this has not been confirmed. According to official sources, the Abyssinian army on the southern front is currently concentrating its forces at various strategic locations opposite the Sidamo mountains, and General Nasipu's troops are also rapidly moving south from Wogaden Province. This action is clearly intended to contain the Italian army's right flank, which has been confirmed. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Results of Greek General Election: Liberal Party Wins Victory; Occupies 127 Seats in the 300-Seat House; Prime Minister Submits Resignation to the King</h3>
<p>Athens - The Greek Liberal Party, led by Sophoulis, has achieved a surprising victory in the general election. According to the latest statistics, the Liberal Party occupies 127 seats in the 300-seat House of Representatives. The Independent Liberal Party, Republican Party, and Agrarian Party, which are close to the Liberal Party, also won several seats each. Therefore, the Liberal Party can receive the support of 142 seats in the House of Representatives. At the same time, several parties opposed to the Liberal Party can also gather 143 seats. Therefore, the Communist Party, which occupies 15 seats, can play a pivotal role between the two parties. Liberal Party leader Venizelos, who is in Paris, has decided not to re-enter politics. It is expected that the King will ask Sophoulis to form a government of national unity, and the opposition party or part of the opposition party may agree to participate in the cabinet. The Greek election was very peaceful, and the number of voters across the country was said to be very enthusiastic. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Republican Party: Presidential Candidate Selection; Borah Publicly Announces Political Views</h3>
<p>Brooklyn, USA - Senator Borah, a progressive Republican senator from Idaho, has been repeatedly rumored to be a Republican presidential candidate. However, he has repeatedly refused to make a formal statement. Today, he announced his active stance. Borah spoke at a joint meeting of progressives from various parties today, urging voters to "break free from the shackles of political giants." At the same time, he also opposed Congress's abuse of power to win the support of the business community. He is well aware that the public has a strong sentiment for pensions, so he suggested that the government legislate to pay pensions of $60 per person per month. Borah strongly attacked President Roosevelt for secretly concluding commercial agreements with other countries, but he did not explicitly mention the president, nor did he criticize the content of these agreements. On foreign policy issues, Borah strongly advocated strict neutrality. Political experts from various parties today said that Borah's speech was tantamount to a public declaration that he was willing to be a Republican candidate. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>New York - Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Borah, a progressive Republican, recently delivered a speech to members of his party. One passage regarding U.S. foreign policy and neutrality stated: "Everyone now seems to want to maintain neutrality. However, maintaining neutrality and trying to stop competition from other countries are mutually exclusive. The correct path for us to follow is to completely separate ourselves from the intricate political problems of other countries. If we want to avoid being dragged down by European events, there is no other way but to absolutely and resolutely isolate ourselves from Europe." (Havas, 28th)</p>

However, if he joins forces with other third-party groups, his power should not be underestimated. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Louisiana Governor Allen Dies Suddenly; Another Enemy of Roosevelt Weakened</h3>
<p>Baton Rouge, USA - Louisiana politics weakened again today, and President Roosevelt lost one less enemy. Governor Allen of that state, who succeeded former Governor HeLong as senator, suddenly died of a cerebral hemorrhage, just a few days after seizing the party's opposition to the New Deal. Allen was the first person to approach HeLong after HeLong was assassinated in the state government last year. He was not a powerful figure in HeLong's faction, but he was the nominal leader of the faction. During the primary election held in the state last week, Allen was elected as the Democratic candidate for HeLong's vacant Senate seat. As far as Louisiana is concerned, the Democratic primary is equivalent to a formal election. After learning of his election, Allen immediately declared that he would continue HeLong's anti-Roosevelt movement. This election is a clear proof of the public's opposition to the New Deal. Allen was a lucky politician who never failed in his repeated elections. However, he never hoped to return to the arena. He supported HeLong throughout his life and regarded him as his teacher.

<h3>Mutual Assistance Smuggling Suppression Measures Formulated</h3>

<h3>Cheng Tianfang's Grand Gathering En Route to Germany: Tea Party Held to Entertain Chinese Passengers; Mr. Cheng Delivers Impromptu Speech Encouraging Each Other</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, departed the country on December 24th of last year, accompanied by his staff, aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Bremen." On January 5th, while traversing the Indian Ocean, Mr. Cheng hosted a tea party. All thirty-one attendees were present, and Mr. Cheng delivered a speech, followed by a response from Sun Duguang. Subsequently, everyone engaged in free conversation and enjoyed refreshments. At 5:00 PM, they stood in solemn attention to sing the Kuomintang party song and shouted "Long Live the Republic of China" three times before dispersing. The text of Mr. Cheng's speech is recorded below: "We fellow Chinese compatriots, numbering over thirty, are traveling on the same ship. Some are going to England, some to France, some to Germany. Some are going for inspections, some to study, and some to serve the government. Although our destinations and missions differ, we have unexpectedly met and are living together. This is truly a rare opportunity, so I specially invited everyone to this tea party. It should have been held on New Year's Day, but due to the ship docking at various ports in recent days, it was postponed until today. I feel this journey is very pleasant. The waves are small, and the routine is very regular. Every place we visit evokes deep interest. However, even in this extreme pleasantness, there are also unpleasant feelings. Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Penang, Perak Bay – these many places have such beautiful scenery and such clean streets, yet the majority of the local Chinese compatriots, hundreds of thousands or even over a million, are all under the rule of a very small number of foreigners and subjected to extremely harsh treatment. Isn't this unpleasantness amidst pleasantness? Thinking deeply about the reasons for this unequal treatment, one is due to the insufficient self-governance capabilities of the overseas Chinese themselves, their inability to unite and organize, so that despite their large numbers, they remain powerless to compete with Westerners. The second is due to the weakness of our national power. Even when subjected to unfair treatment, the country is unable to protect the overseas Chinese. Regarding the first point, we hope that the knowledge and self-governance capabilities of the overseas Chinese can be improved through the concerted efforts of all parties. Regarding the second point, if the country becomes increasingly strong, overseas Chinese citizens will naturally be respected. Speaking of this, I am saddened by the news I have received in the two weeks since leaving the country. Everywhere brings pain. Recently, enemy troops again arbitrarily bombed and destroyed our cities and killed our people in Chahar. The North China Incident is also expanding daily. I don't know what kind of changes will occur in the near future. These are all very sad news. However, despite our sadness, we must absolutely not despair or be pessimistic. The rise and fall of countries and nations in the world is a constant throughout history. As long as we can strive when we are weak, it is very possible to turn weakness into strength. Indeed, China is now at the most difficult and dangerous time in its history, but I believe that as long as we work hard, the national crisis can definitely be averted. When we look at past history, it will increase our courage. China has five thousand years of glorious history, but its misfortune has only been in the recent century. Comparing one hundred years to five thousand years is really not a big deal. Perhaps the next hundred years will be even more glorious than the past five thousand years. Let's look at European history again. At the beginning of the 19th century, Germany was almost entirely occupied by Napoleon. But by the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, France was defeated and Germany won. France ceded the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany and paid huge reparations. In less than fifty years, the situation changed dramatically again. As a result of the European War, Germany was defeated by France again, and the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine returned to France. But recently, Germany has raised its head again. In just one hundred and thirty years, there have been three or four changes. From this, who knows if the changes in East Asian international relations in a few decades will not be the same as those between Germany and France at that time? If we carefully examine the current situation, we must never lose courage. Not only should we not lose courage, but we should also increase our courage. We should take Germany in the Napoleonic era, France after the Franco-Prussian War, and Germany after the Great War as good examples. With China's large population and abundant resources, it surpasses any other country. I believe that national rejuvenation will definitely be easier than for other countries. Finally, regarding ourselves, our words and actions in the country only affect individuals, but once abroad, every citizen, not just diplomats, represents the country. Every move, every word, and every action deeply affects the country's honor. Naturally, because our country is weak, we will suffer humiliating treatment, but our own words and actions must not be open to any criticism. If our position is not right and we receive unfair treatment, then we must strive to resist and correct it. I hope everyone pays attention to this. Those of you going to Germany can see each other often after arriving in Europe. Those going to England and France, I hope you will also communicate often, so that the friendship we have developed on the ship can be maintained forever. I wish you all good health and to work hard for the country!" (January 5th, sent from the "Bremen")</p>
<h3>Central Disaster Relief Organization Policy</h3>
<p>Since Consultant Baker came to China in response to the invitation of the Ministry of Communications in the 5th year of the Republic of China, he has resided in China for twenty years. He has successively founded work relief organizations in Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces, and has traveled through disaster areas without fear of hardship. In recent years, he has successively served as a member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and a consultant to the Central Relief Committee. In these twenty years, there has not been a single day that he has not been engaged in disaster relief work. As he is about to return to his country, he has written this article based on his past experience and shared it with us. The translator has known Consultant Baker for many years, respects his enthusiasm, and admires his wise words, so he has translated it for the reference of those who care about relief work. Translator: Duan Yuan.</p>
<p>Throughout history, disaster relief and poverty alleviation have been valued by emperors of past dynasties. The gradual relaxation of this began at the end of the Qing Dynasty. In ancient times, the implementation of disaster relief first exhausted the resources of the county. If the county's resources were insufficient, then the province's resources were used. If the province's resources were insufficient, then the national resources were used. Either actively allocating relief funds from the national treasury, or passively exempting taxes by order. Since the establishment of the National Government, various administrative measures have been gradually implemented, and more serious attention has been paid to disaster relief.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Reserve Fund</p>
<p>On July 1st of the 24th year, the Ministry of Finance implemented the inclusion of the disaster relief reserve fund in the budget. This can be regarded as an important step taken by the government to earnestly take responsibility for disaster relief work. However, the existence of the disaster relief fund is enough to cause disputes over allocation among the provinces. Therefore, if there is even a slight disaster, the severity of the disaster is deliberately exaggerated in order to obtain more control. And the representatives want to save face in their own provinces, and do not hesitate to make lengthy descriptions, describing the disaster situation in their province as unprecedented. As a result, the central government cannot obtain the true picture of the disaster situation in each province, and the allocation of relief funds cannot be fair.</p>
<p>Fair and Impartial Disaster Situation Reports Are Obtainable</p>
<p>Therefore, the government must seek detailed reports of the disaster situation in addition to the provinces' letters and telegrams as a basis for allocation. The agricultural information reports of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and the rural surveys of Jinling University are sufficient for application. From these reports, one can know the harvest situation in the disaster area, the general storage of food, the comparison of living standards, and population and other matters, so as to identify the severity of the needs in each disaster area, and to obtain a more fair proportion for the allocation of relief funds.</p>
<p>Distribution by Household Is Not Easy</p>
<p>To seek a fair distribution among disaster-stricken households is more difficult than making a proper allocation between provinces. Some may avoid this difficulty and directly eliminate the investigation procedure, and provide relief to each household uniformly. This method is not sufficient. Investigation by household is necessary in accordance with the principle of disaster relief. However, this kind of work cannot be handled by the existing lower-level officials. On the one hand, the officials lack this kind of experience, and on the other hand, the officials are constrained by their original duties and have no sufficient time to apply. Therefore, the external relief funds released in each disaster area in the past must be implemented by external relief workers who conduct investigations before releasing them. And during the investigation, when the people know that they are investigation and relief personnel, then all questions must be answered with poverty and seeking relief, and no one will not be able to live without relief. If you want to investigate carefully, the area is so wide that not only is the cost huge, but it also takes a lot of time. By the time the investigation is completed, the release has missed the deadline. What's more, even if the investigation is serious, being deceived is still inevitable.</p>
<p>Implementing Work Relief Is a Fair Method of Relief</p>
<p>If you want to avoid deception, reduce investigation costs, and shorten investigation time, then the release of relief funds should adopt work relief. Those disaster victims who join the work are given a minimum standard value, so that they can use their daily efforts to obtain the lowest value to purchase the cheapest food to feed their families. The work value should not exceed this standard, for fear of the danger of competing for work. Relief funds are easily exhausted, and those who should not be relieved are also induced to get involved. Under the lowest value work relief system, the names of disaster workers are publicly announced, so that the confusion of those who should not be relieved can be effectively restricted. If this method is implemented in a relatively wealthy province and there are few disaster workers recruited, it is sufficient to prove that the area still has the remaining strength to support itself and that central relief is not necessary. If so, the allocation of relief funds between provinces and between disaster victims can be obtained equally.</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned work relief is different from national conscription. Work relief gives disaster workers the lowest work value, which is enough to purchase the cheapest food to maintain a family's life. Therefore, it is called relief. Conscription is feasible in peacetime, but it should not exist at the same time as work relief in disaster areas.</p>
<p>The management of disaster workers should also be different from the employment of workers in ordinary projects. It is not advisable to take the contracting system. Under the contracting system, how much do workers actually get after the work value passes through the hands of large and small contractors? There is no way to ask. Therefore, the organization of disaster workers should be in rows of twenty-five to thirty people, with row leaders directly in charge. There should also be a grievance mechanism to prohibit row leaders from deducting and engaging in fraud. At first glance, this method requires adding many row leaders and foremen's wages compared to the contracting system, but in fact, because of direct management, many estrangements and labor unrest can be reduced, and the efficiency of work can be improved. In the end, it is still more advantageous than the contracting system. And if the work unit and method are announced to the public, and secret inspections are implemented, then all the bad habits and various malpractices of the foremen towards the workers can be completely eliminated. The highways built by the National Economic Commission and the construction departments of the provinces have a great effect on preventing natural disasters. However, the project itself has not yet been able to use disaster workers to make a direct impact on disaster relief. In the future, if the above-mentioned work relief method can be used in the disaster area, then in addition to construction, the effect of disaster relief can be generated.</p>
<p>The Organization of Relief</p>
<p>What method should be used to relieve the old, weak, widowed, orphaned, and those who lack care other than the strong men, and who themselves are unable to work? Only their neighbors know who is helpless and cannot live without relief. It cannot be distinguished by the personnel sent by the central relief agency. Therefore, the central relief funds should not be used for relief, but should be used by local funds, and the local groups should be relieved separately. The central and provincial governments are responsible for the relief of the adults and their families, and the local widows, orphans, old and weak are relieved by the local government as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Grain Storage System Should Be Restored Urgently</p>
<p>Relief should be handled by local charities, as mentioned above. Where does the local financial resources come from? The system of storing grain has been practiced in China for a long time. At least each county must have a granary. The grain stored in a good year is the local financial resource, so as to plan for the year of shortage. The establishment of warehouses in places along the river and along the river is important. High and low places are not far apart. This surplus and that deficiency are often opposite. If public warehouses are established and adjusted each other, they can avoid the suffering of poverty. The beach land along the river and lake is formed by the accumulation of mud and sand. The soil is fertile. When the water is small, the harvest is particularly abundant. However, the land originally belongs to a part of the river and lake, and is the place to accommodate floods. Therefore, the construction of dikes and the facilities of the project should not hinder the function of accommodating floods. In dry years, when the water level is not high, we should use cultivation to produce. But when there is a big water, we should not be able to strongly prevent it from accommodating floods, and use neighboring towns as gully. In this period, we should use grain storage to maintain, and we can ask others. Therefore, if the warehouse system can be actively implemented in the beach land, the lives of the farmers in the beach land can be guaranteed, and the national water conservancy facilities can be exempted from opposition and obstruction.</p>
<p>Now the government and the people have taken positive action on the construction of warehouses. The Ministry of Internal Affairs promulgated the local warehousing management rules on January 15th of the 19th year of the Republic of China. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is a supervisory agency, and the responsibility of promotion is still in the hands of various relief agencies and groups.</p>
<p>Before the grain storage system is widely established, how can the local country assume the method of relief? We can take the method of coping with the flood in Shandong as a reference. The method in Shandong Province is to move the victims in the disaster area to the neighboring counties for food. The number of people who are moved to food is based on the original population of each neighboring county, and must not exceed a certain percentage. Therefore, they will not be a burden on the neighboring counties, and the victims will be spared from starvation.</p>

<h3>The Lunar New Year Has Passed: The Hankou Business Market Is Bleak; Most Have Turned into Disaster-Stricken Businesses; Closures Outnumber New Openings; Except for Banks That Made a Slight Profit, All Others Suffered Losses</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Lunar New Year in Wuhan, except for military and political organs that continued to work as usual, the business market conducted a total conclusion on the 23rd of this month, Lunar New Year's Eve. Banks facing industrial and commercial enterprises or Qian Zhuang, Qian Zhuang facing industrial and commercial enterprises, Ji industrial and commercial enterprises wholesale merchants facing retailers, all long-term debts were respectively concluded, and occasionally there were those who paid interest to transfer the period. Fortunately, the matter of debt owed greatly affecting the market was avoided. The reason why this difficult pass was able to be passed safely is that since last spring, the fall in prices has formed a financial panic, and no relief measures have been sought, which has ultimately led to an increase in the elimination effect. Stores with insufficient capital or operating losses have already closed down one after another, and cannot wait until the end of the year. From the 24th to the 27th of this month, all stores in the city were completely closed. The market opened on the 28th. The profit and loss of the past year is not yet certain, but what can be generally known is that the banking industry has made a slight profit, and all others have suffered unbearable losses. In the future, they will either reorganize, close down, or reduce the scope, and lay off employees. The result will inevitably directly reduce the prosperity of the market and indirectly affect social stability. Currently, in terms of changes in the business community, there are no increases or decreases in the banking industry. Qian Zhuang has newly opened Hengxiang and reorganized Yongyuan, closed down Lianyi, Xiexing, Dingxin, and Zikang, and increased capital in Changyu. In other industries, closures are generally more than new openings. According to Huang Wenzhi, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, most of the businessmen in this city have become disaster-stricken businesses under the long-term high pressure of the depression, which shows the bleakness of the market in the future. In addition, the Yu Yuan Silver House bankruptcy case, which triggered a financial panic tide at the end of June last year, after the Ministry of Finance sent a commissioner Shen Zhiqing to clean up, is estimated to owe 1.5 million yuan, to be repaid at 30%, which requires 450,000 yuan. Shanghai shareholders have already recognized 160,000 yuan, together with 140,000 yuan in cash collected in Hankou, to repay 20% in advance. The rest will be waited for the manager of the bank, Wang Huiqing, to regain his freedom and then go to Shanghai to raise funds, which has generally come to an end. In addition, the Wuchang First, Zhenhuan, and Minsheng three yarn factories, which have been shut down for a long time, have recently heard that the authorities are actively planning to resume work, so that 20,000 unemployed workers can maintain their livelihoods. However, it is said that the content is complicated and there are many difficulties. Whether they can get their wish, or whether they can continue for a long time after resuming work, in this time of public and private distress, it is difficult to predict. (28th)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Students: All Automatically Resume Classes; The New Resolutions of the General Assembly of School Representatives: National Salvation Plan to Be Drafted by the Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: All students above secondary level in Wuhan established the National Salvation United Association some time ago, held demonstrations, and went on strike on the 29th of last month. Although the authorities advanced the holidays, they did not actually resume classes. Now that the start of the school term is approaching, this issue needs to be resolved urgently. On the 28th, the fourth general assembly of representatives was held at the Provincial Second Women's Middle School. More than 60 representatives from more than 30 schools attended, and Wu Xingfu, You Guoliang, and Yang Zhenhua were elected as the presidium. Cheng Qibao, Director of the Department of Education, and Yang Jin Yu, member of the Provincial Party Department, were also invited to attend. After the meeting, Cheng Qibao spoke first, saying that the student movement has now become one with the government, which is the result of President Chiang's meeting. He hoped to pay attention to three points: Everyone should stand on the same front, and words and deeds should be consistent; Actions should be rationalized, and do not forget reason because of temporary anger; Future movements should have a fixed plan, follow the order, bury themselves in hard work, and be a strong backing for the government. Yang Jin Yu spoke next, hoping to determine a complete plan, and please pay attention to four points: Have the determination to believe in the leader; Strengthen the student patriotic movement organization; Organize an intelligence team; Promote domestic goods. Then Wu Xingfu, chairman of the presidium, and Wu Daoming, representative, successively reported and discussed the solution to the Yingcheng incident. They all believed that the government's punishment of the culprit Yao Chucai was too light, and other perpetrators had not yet been punished. It was decided to discuss it again after consulting the opinions of the Yingcheng Student National Salvation United Association. Then they discussed the resumption of classes and the continuation of national salvation work, and decided on two cases: 1. All schools will resume classes uniformly from today, and the executive committee will draft a declaration of resumption of classes; 2. The principles of student movement work were passed, and the executive committee was asked to draft an implementation plan. The problem of resuming classes, which had been delayed for a month, was completely resolved at this point. (28th)</p>
<h3>The Loss After the Collapse of the People's Embankment in Juancheng: More Than 100 Villages Were Flooded, Population About 100,000; Mr. Pu and Mr. Gu Went to Huanghuasi to Inspect</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, recently received a report from Qin Daoyu, the magistrate of Juancheng County, stating that the receding levee of Juancheng and the Dongwang people's levee were successively hit and collapsed by the ice flood. The water flowed to the northeast. The area of Juancheng County flooded is about 100 li long from east to west and 10 li to 20 li wide from north to south. A total of 100 villages were flooded, with more than 10,000 households and a population of more than 100,000. There are still more than 10 villages surrounded by the ice flood. Now there are more than 100,000 disaster victims in the territory, shivering in the ice and snow, without clothes or food, and the situation is extremely miserable. He requested Han to forward a telegram to the central government to rush for relief to save the disaster victims. Han then telegraphed the situation reported by Qin Daoyu to the central government and asked the central government to provide emergency relief.</p>
<p>Pu Deli and Gu Sang, water conservancy experts from the League of Nations, led by the National Economic Commission, arrived in Jinan from Beijing on the evening of the 26th. On the 27th, they went to Huanghuasi and Dongzhuangkoumen with Yang Baopu (engineer of the Economic Commission), Dai Qi (engineer of the Economic Commission), Song Wentian, director of the Xiaoqingcheng Engineering Bureau of the Shandong Construction Department, and Pan Yifen, chief engineer of the River Affairs Bureau, to inspect whether the flood from the Juancheng people's embankment can enter the river from Huanghuasi, and whether Dongzhuangkoumen has any impact. Pu and others departed from Jinan at 8:00 a.m. that day, arrived at Luokou at 9:00 a.m., and crossed the river by boat. Although it was frozen, it was fortunate that the water rose and was able to cross. After crossing the river, they advanced westward along the embankment and arrived at Guanzhuang at 11:00 a.m. They got off the car and rested at the flood control headquarters. The second team of the Yellow River Survey Team was stationed here. Then they took a car westward and arrived at Taochengbu at 3:00 p.m. They still rested and dined at the flood control headquarters to inspect the situation of the Yellow River. The Yellow River is now frozen, and large ships can no longer pass, only small boats. That night, they stayed in Taochengbu. Gu and others originally planned to go along the Jin embankment to Dahetou, which belongs to Hebei, cross the river to inspect Dongzhuang. Because they were afraid that they would not be able to pass by boat, they prepared to store the car in Taochengbu on the 28th, and then cross to the south bank of Yangzha, from Yangzha to Lishengtun, to Dongzhuang. If the journey goes smoothly, they could arrive at Dongzhuang on the evening of the 28th. On the 29th, they will inspect Dongzhuangkoumen again. On the 30th, Gu will go to Kaifeng to transfer to Xi'an to inspect the West Highway, and then take a plane to Lanzhou. Pu Deli, Yang Baopu, and Dai Qi will go to Kaifeng with Gu, and then part ways and return to Nanjing to report their orders. Song Wentian and Pan Yifen will return to Jinan by the original route.

<h3>Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Field Holds Aquatic Products Promotion: Open Exhibition on February 1st and 2nd</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Field, because the people of Zhejiang Province still lack knowledge of aquatic products and have little understanding of the importance of the aquatic products industry, decided to hold an aquatic products promotion meeting at the Dinghai field site on February 1st and 2nd (February 1st is the anniversary of the establishment of the field). There are six exhibition rooms and the entire field is open for public viewing. It is heard that the exhibits include fish fry sources, fish farming, condensation manufacturing, and fishing village construction, which are very wonderful and contain profound meaning. The exhibition dates are set for 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the 1st and 2nd. Thousands of copies of popular industry books are available for distribution to guests. The opening ceremony will be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 1st, and officials or representatives of various agencies and groups are invited to participate. According to the person in charge of the field, this time, a small-scale publicity exhibition will be held in Dinghai first, and in the future, it is planned to expand it to Hangzhou and other places in order.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Guangdong Provincial Industries Recently</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Government, based on the Three-Year Governance Plan, is actively promoting the development of industries such as cement, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, fertilizer, and sugar refining. A reporter, through the introduction of Lin Jingwen, the manager of Guangdong Provincial Material Products, had the opportunity to visit the cement, caustic soda, nitric acid, and fertilizer plants. The following is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>All four plants are located in the Guangdong Provincial First Industrial Zone in Shitougang, Xicun, Guangzhou. The cement plant is the largest in scale, facing the river in the front and backed by the Yuehan Railway, making the transportation of raw materials and products convenient. The plant was approved by the Guangdong Political Committee in 1928, and mechanized soil production began in June 1933, with operations commencing in July. The initial investment was over four million yuan. The main raw materials for cement production are limestone from Yingde and Huaxian, and soil from the outskirts of Guangzhou. It produces 210 tons of "Five Rams" brand cement per day. The plant is equipped with crushers, washing machines, raw material mills, slurry towers, rotary kilns, coal mills, clinker mills, and packaging machines. Raw limestone is transported from the mine to the plant, where it can be up to a foot in size. After being crushed into smaller pieces by the crusher, it is mixed with slurry and sent to the raw material mill. The raw material mill is shaped like a long cylinder, with various sizes of steel balls inside. Electricity is used to rotate it, and the crushed stone entering the mill is impacted by the steel balls, turning it into slurry. The slurry is then pumped through the slurry tower and into the rotary kiln. The rotary kiln is over eighty meters long and over two meters in diameter, placed at an angle and rotated continuously by electricity. The slurry flows in from the top of the kiln, while pulverized coal is blown in from the bottom. The heat rises and flows against the slurry, driving out the moisture and maturing the clinker. The clinker is then mixed with gypsum and sent to the clinker mill to be ground into a very fine powder. The powder is then packaged into barrels or bags using packaging machines and transported to various places for sale. Because supply cannot meet demand, the plant has been profitable every year since it started operation. The electricity used by the plant is self-supplied. It has two steam boilers, a 1,500-kilowatt turbine generator, and a 600-kilowatt wind-powered generator. The latter is for temporary use, while the turbine generator is used for power generation on a regular basis, averaging about 25,000 kilowatts per day.</p>
<p>The caustic soda plant was approved by the provincial government in 1932 and was established in the summer of 1935. It produces caustic soda, bleaching powder, and hydrochloric acid, all of which are important materials for various industries. However, it suspended production shortly after starting due to the need to purchase parts and supplement equipment. The raw material used by the plant is salt, which is extracted from Kanbaichang. Except for porcelain tubes which were purchased from England, all other important machines were purchased from the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States.</p>
<p>The sulfuric acid plant is not very large in scale. It uses sulfur as a raw material and produces sulfuric acid through electrolysis. Daily production is not enough to meet sales demand. Recently, the plant decided to use iron sulfide as a raw material instead, because the price of sulfur is too high, which greatly raises the cost.</p>
<p>The fertilizer plant is also currently closed for renovation. The fertilizer produced here is either nitrogenous fertilizer or phosphorous fertilizer. The plant produced phosphorous fertilizer when it started. According to the plant's staff, after the plant is reopened, it will also produce nitrogenous fertilizer in order to meet demand.

<p>Songjiang: Robbers Caught in Jinshanzui</p>
<p>Li Mingding, the squad leader of the 12th Security Brigade stationed in Caoging, Punan County, recently received a tip that Luo Zixiang, a suspected robber in the case of robbing the wealthy Wu Yunsheng's home in Huan'an, was hiding in his home in Jinshanzui. He led a team to raid the house quietly the night before last. He also learned that Luo Zixiang was also suspected of being involved in a robbery case in a certain town in Fengxian County. Squad leader Lou had Luo arrested and sent to Songjiang and transferred him to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. Meanwhile, Squad leader Lu was ordered to continue to investigate other criminals.</p>
<p>Nanhui: Snack Shop Owner Kills Partner for Affair</p>
<p>A male corpse of about thirty years of age was found on the 13th beside the guard embankment in Beiqu Chiwan, Yancang Town, Second District. Blood stains were all over the ground, indicating that the person had been murdered. The town government reported the case to the district, who transferred it to the county for investigation. The corpse had three fatal knife wounds. The county ordered that the murderer be arrested and brought to justice. At the end of the old calendar year, Zhou Fuchen, a patrol officer of the water police of the county's Public Security Bureau, learned that the case was due to Zhang Chunlin, the owner of the snack shop in the town, having an affair with Xu, the wife of the shop assistant Tian Niansheng, and murdering Tian in order to permanently take Xu as his mistress. Zhang Chunlin, the accomplice Zhu Asi, and the corpse's wife Xu were arrested and brought to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. Zhang Chunlin and Zhu Asi fully admitted to killing Tian Niansheng and have been sent to the county for trial.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Son-Killing Case to Reopen Arguments</p>
<p>The case of Ling Zhou, the wife of Ling Rongchang, a resident of Yingqiao Lane in the city, killing her two sons with a knife has been brought to public prosecution by the court's prosecutor under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for murder. After several court hearings, the criminal court concluded the trial and originally scheduled the sentence for the 28th. However, the presiding judge Liu, for the sake of caution in handling the case, issued a criminal ruling to reopen the verbal debate at 2 p.m. on February 6th. Subpoenas were issued, stating that attendance was mandatory, and witnesses Ling Rongchang's mother, Ling Tu, and landlord Ma Baoshan, defense lawyer Tang Mingfeng, Ling Rongchang, Ling Zhou, and others were summoned.</p>
<p>Changshu: Groundbreaking Ceremony Held at Baimao Gate</p>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for the giant Baimao Gate in Changshu, which is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in Jiangsu Province, is scheduled to be held on the 30th in Dongzhang City, Changshu. The matter is under the overall direction of Dong Wenqi, an engineer from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. The engineering materials and the acquisition of more than eighty acres of land were completed by the end of last year. It is reported that Kong Xiangxi of the National Economic Commission and Chuan Rulin of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association will personally participate in the groundbreaking ceremony. The project office has arranged several special vehicles at the Changshu bus station to take passengers to Zhitang Town, and then take a steamship to Dongzhang City. The ceremony is quite grand. This giant gate costs more than 400,000 yuan and is scheduled to be completed in eight months, which can be said to be a major project in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Nantong: Overview of Various Industries After Final Accounting</p>
<p>Last year, Nantong's industries were mostly depressed due to the impact of the global recession. However, the cotton industry happened to coincide with the currency reform. When the new cotton was launched on the market, Chinese and foreign cotton merchants benefited from the floating exchange rate and purchased as much as possible, which led to a rapid rise in the cotton market, and various firms and banks made huge profits. The industries that suffered the most losses were the pawnshops, and the money houses were also at the end of their rope. Of those that were listed on the market in the year of Bingzi (1936), only three, namely Dongyuan, Yingtai, and Zhizhi, remained; the rest were all closed.</p>

<p>Tax Police Captain Robs and Awaits Interrogation</p>
<p>Yi Da Soy Sauce Garden in Dongquanmen, Yangcheng, was robbed by two robbers with a Hefei accent around 10 p.m. on the 22nd. They broke in with box cannons and pistols and robbed more than ten yuan in foreign currency. The victim, Gao Yingqi, chased them to Jiangbei Bathhouse in Guqiting, where they encountered Wang Xinhua and Liang Gangfeng, patrolmen from the second branch, who bravely arrested Li Yaoshan and Li Shaoji and seized a Browning pistol with the number 4692 and several bullets, as well as a White pistol with the number 23038 and five bullets, and tax police badges. The case has now been handed over to the Public Security Bureau. After investigation, Li Yaoshan, 28 years old, and Li Shaoji, 37 years old, who are cousins and from Hefei, denied the robbery. The plaintiff, however, testified that they were indeed the robbers. In addition to handing Li Yaoshan over to the tax police corps as requested by the corps, the bureau has transferred Li Shaoji along with the plaintiff to the court. According to Li in the detention room, he came to Yangzhou on the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month to borrow money from his younger brother to spend the New Year. After drinking on the 28th, he went to the soy sauce garden to exchange small bills, and a conflict occurred, but he was accused of robbery. It is also heard that Li Yaoshan is currently the captain of the 102nd team of the tax police corps. On the 27th, the court's prosecutor's office has sent a letter to the tax police corps asking them to send Yaoshan to the court for questioning with the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Four Opium Offenders Paraded Through the Streets</p>
<p>On the 26th, the county government selected four opium addicts and escorted them to the anti-smoking propaganda meeting at the Xinmin Theatre to listen to lectures. After the meeting, they were paraded through the streets. First came the troops, followed by the band, then the representatives of the organizations, then the public security police, and then the opium offenders, each wearing a square of white paper with the words "opium offender" written on it. Finally, there were several police officers bringing up the rear. All the addicts who saw this were terrified.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Many Money Houses Close Down and Reorganize</p>
<p>Hangzhou's silver and money industry has reopened after the old lunar year, but the money industry is facing difficulties and it is hard to be confident about its future operations. Considering the current situation, it is better to close down as soon as possible to avoid future failures. Yesterday, several houses voluntarily announced their closure, including Yinyuan and Lunyuan Zhuang of the Zhejiang gang and Hengyu Zhuang of Dongjielu. The above-mentioned houses had a considerable history in Hangzhou's financial circles and a large business scope. They were closed down due to the managers and shareholders' unwillingness to continue operating. Tongtai Zhuang is undergoing reorganization, with the addition of Xingji. There have been changes in shareholders. There is also news of Anfu Zhuang reorganizing, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Mob Smashes Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Wu Rujian, the director of the Seventh Public Security Bureau in Xinfeng, Jiaxing, investigated gambling in a blacksmith shop in Xishi on the second day of the first lunar month, which provoked public anger. People flocked to the bureau. Director Wu also ordered the police to arbitrarily arrest onlookers, so the crowd smashed the equipment in the bureau. Later, the garrison suppressed the situation. The police arrested Wang Er, Han Ape, Dong Ahu, Lin Jinqian, Chen Yuchun, Shen Yongting, and other six people, and after torturing them, they were sent to the county government for review yesterday. The county government believes that the bureau failed to stop gambling and prevent the riot, so they appointed Zheng Chunxiang as the new director. However, Lin Jinqian, Chen Zichun, Shen Yongting, and the other three were severely injured by torture and have filed a lawsuit with the court for relief.</p>

<h3>A Brief Introduction to China's Natural Regions - Professor of Central University</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese geography has become increasingly developed, and the study of natural regions has become more precise. In particular, Mr. Zhu Kezhen's eight major regions, with their concise and comprehensive outlines, are often used as a basis by geographers. (The "New Map of China by Province" compiled by Ding Wenjiang et al. contains this map). I have said that in Chinese geography, topography is the primary guideline, and climate is the secondary guideline. However, the distribution of topography is more complex, and is not as systematic as climate. Mr. Zhu's zoning is based on climate, while also taking into account topography. Recent new studies, such as soil regions and plant regions, when compared to Mr. Zhu's climate regions, often have a harmonious and beneficial effect. In the past, I divided China into 23 regions in the textbooks I compiled. Now I can use these eight regions to summarize them. Now, the basic facts of these eight regions will be briefly explained below.</p>
<p>South China Region: Also known as the Lingnan Region, it includes the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The average temperature in January (the coldest month) is above 10 degrees Celsius, and the rainfall is around 1,000 to 1,500 millimeters. The characteristic of this region is that there is no winter, but it is different from the year-round summer of the tropics. Because there is still adjustment in spring or autumn, it is called the Subtropical climate. Hainan Island is located entirely in the tropics. Except for the Pearl River Delta, most of this region is hilly. The Nanling Mountains are far less regular and majestic than the Beiling Mountains, and the highest point is no more than 2,000 meters. The rivers, except for the Pearl River system, mostly flow into the sea independently, and their upper reaches often penetrate deep into the watershed ridge, with the Xiang and Gui rivers sharing the same source being the most famous phenomenon. The plants in this region experience deciduous phenomena when the climate is colder, which is called the Summer Green Forest region, to distinguish it from the tropical rainforest. Palm plants in Guangdong, such as coconuts, betel nuts, cattails, and sunflower palms, are everywhere. Hainan Island is the only region in China where rubber trees can be planted. Fujian and Guangdong are also rich in subtropical fruits, such as bananas, pineapples, lychees, longans, oranges, grapefruits, olives, etc. This region is mostly mountainous and densely populated. There has been a long history of maritime development, and it is the home of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the United States. There are still uncivilized ethnic groups in remote mountain areas, such as the Li and Yao people.</p>
<p>Central China Region: Also known as the Great River Region, it roughly includes the provinces in the Yangtze River basin. The average temperature in winter months is below 10 degrees Celsius, but it is still above 10 degrees in November, and the rainfall is above 750 millimeters. The climate of this region is characterized by a clear rhythm of the four seasons, and the rainfall distribution in each month is quite uniform. Most of the terrain is plains and hills, such as the alluvial plain of the Great River Delta and the lacustrine plain in the Great Lakes area. The upper reaches of the Han River have reached the alpine region, but the area near Hanzhong is a partial plain, from which the name of the Han people originated. To the north, the Qinling plank road leads to Chang'an, which is full of historical interest. Also, the area near Chengdu in Sichuan is an inland plain, with a larger scale than the Hanzhong Plain. The deciduous phenomenon of plants in this region is very obvious. In hilly or alpine areas, coniferous trees are often located above broad-leaved trees. The waterways in the hilly area are mostly unobstructed, and the forestry is quite prosperous, mainly pine and fir. There are many types of broad-leaved trees, and maple and camphor trees grow very large. Although Sichuan Province is located in the Yangtze River basin, its climate is very warm, and ice and snow are rare, so there are subtropical plants such as banyan trees, lychees, oranges, grapefruits, and sugar cane. Sichuan is a basin, with the hilly area in the middle only about 600 meters above sea level, and the surrounding mountains are 1,000 to 4,000 meters high. The high mountains in the northwest and west, in particular, have the effect of shielding the cold winter winds. The water conservancy in Sichuan is also excellent. There is an ancient saying that "the benefits of the Yangtze River are in Shu, and the irrigation of the marshes is in Chu." The Great River did not have many floods until after it came out of the Three Gorges. The plains in the middle and lower reaches of the Great River are mainly used for growing rice. Water buffaloes roam and thatched huts are scattered, making it the most densely populated place in the world. China's major rice markets are all located here. The most important products of the hilly areas are tea, hemp, antimony, tung oil, porcelain, and bamboo paper. The Great River Delta has waterways that are divided into numerous branches, and it uses mulberry gardens and cotton fields as raw materials, making it the industrial center of China, especially the silk and cotton industries. The fishing industry in the Zhoushan Islands is very developed.</p>
<p>North China Region: Also known as the Huang-Huai Region, it includes the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River basin. The Qinling Mountains and the Huai River divide it from the Central China Region, so the southern part of Shaanxi belongs to the Central China Region and the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui belong to the North China Region. The average temperature in November in this region is below 10 degrees Celsius, but above zero degrees Celsius, the average temperature throughout the year is above 10 degrees Celsius, and the annual rainfall is above 400 millimeters. The eastern part of this region, except for the Shandong Peninsula, is a large plain, formed by the alluvium of the Yellow River, the Huai River, and the Hai River. However, the waterways have repeatedly migrated and collapsed, and the Grand Canal runs through the north and south, so the water problem is most important. The Wei River basin in central Shaanxi is an inland plain. Northern Shaanxi and Shanxi are both plateaus, with an altitude of about 1,000 meters, with partial basins in between that are suitable for cultivation. As a result of thousands of years of agricultural development in this region, most of the forests have been cut down. There are some high peaks that still retain some remnants of the forests. Due to the severe and dry winters, broad-leaved trees and coniferous trees often grow together. Fruit trees, such as peaches and pears, develop exceptionally well. The Huai River is an important boundary line in Chinese agriculture, separating the rice paddies of the south from the dry fields of the north. The crops in North China are mostly wheat, sorghum, corn, millet, etc., which is called the dryland farming region. In Shaanxi, the Hanzhong Plain is a rice field region, and the Wei River Plain north of the Qinling Mountains is also a dryland farming region. Cotton production in North China is also very important. In terms of mining, the coal mines in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces are very developed. The coal mines in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces on the west bank of the Yellow River are extremely rich in coal reserves. The oil in northern Shaanxi and the bauxite mines in Shandong are particularly valuable in national defense. The Shandong Peninsula is the source of migration for the three northeastern provinces. Most farmers move there together, while single people go there in the fall and return.</p>
<p>Northeast Region: This region covers almost all of the Northeast provinces. The average temperature throughout the year is below 10 degrees Celsius, and for at least five months of the year, it is below 0 degrees Celsius. The annual rainfall is around 500 millimeters, with some areas reaching 1,000 millimeters. The terrain of this region is mostly plains and hills. The plains in the Songhua River and Liao River basins, known as the Songliao Plain, belong to the prairie zone. A prairie is also a kind of grassland with very few trees. However, while grasslands usually refer to dry regions, prairies are relatively humid. The Northeast Plain has now been transformed into an agricultural region. Although the climate is very harsh, the soil is fertile and the rainfall is abundant, with rich yields of wheat and soybeans. It is the final destination of migration for our country and a treasure trove of agriculture left by heaven. Currently, the Northeast Plain has a population of about 20 million people, and it can accommodate another 20 million people. The forests in Changbai Mountain and Xing'an Mountain are also very famous, with what is called "woji," which means old forests in the mountains. The wood in the eastern provinces, such as red pine, fir, and yellow flower pine, is used for building materials and has the widest range of uses. The mineral resources are particularly rich in the area where the plains and hills meet. The mining industry, including coal, iron, oil, and gold, is the most developed in the country.</p>
<p>Yun-Gui Region: The provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou are plateaus, with an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 meters. The climate is an improved version of subtropical, with very little change in cold and heat. The average temperature throughout the year is between 14 and 18 degrees Celsius, and the rainfall throughout the year is above 750 millimeters. Although the climate is good, the terrain is very rugged. There is a saying that "there is no three miles of flat land." The lacustrine plains in Kunming and other places are the best in the plateau environment, but they are limited to local areas. Plants in this region are lush, with many unique species, but there are not many forests. The main agricultural product is corn. Because of the difficult transportation, the development is relatively slow. Most of the Han people migrated from the Great River Region during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The high mountains in Guizhou are still the homes of the Miao people. The terrain in western Yunnan is very different. The lower reaches of the Nujiang and Lancang Rivers have a low terrain and a hot climate, with tropical plants similar to the regions of South China. To the north of Dali, the high mountains are stacked, and it is known for its high-altitude plants. Therefore, the ethnic groups in western Yunnan are often divided into three layers: the Bai live in the hot river valleys, the savages live in the cold high mountains, and the Han Chinese live on the plateau at an altitude of about 1,300 to 1,400 meters, where the climate is cool and most suitable for health.</p>
<p>Grassland Region: This region includes the western part of the three northeastern provinces, the Jehol province, and the southern part of the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, and most of Gansu Province. The average temperature throughout the year is between 5 and 0 degrees Celsius, and the rainfall throughout the year is between 300 and 400 millimeters. This region is generally a plateau terrain, namely the Hulunbuir Plateau in Heilongjiang Province, the Inner Mongolia Plateau, and the Gansu Plateau. The Gansu Plateau is covered with gullies, which is called Longban in ancient times, and the terrain is also quite rugged. The upper reaches of the Yellow River pass through this region, expanding along the river into inland plains, such as the Ningxia Plain and the Hetao Plain. Due to insufficient rainfall in this region, it has become a dry grassland without trees. The main component is perennial herbs. The Mongols graze here, living in tents and making a living from livestock skins. Mongolian horses have always been very important in border affairs. Agriculture is also quite developed in places along the Yellow River that are convenient for irrigation. The wheat, tobacco, and fruit trees produced in Lanzhou are of excellent quality. In Ningxia Hetao area, farmland is also limited to places where canals flow. Ningxia is known for producing rice, and Suiyuan and other places mainly produce wheat. The quality and taste are unique and not found elsewhere, because the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Mongolia-Xinjiang Region: Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Hexi Corridor (the area around Ganliang Suzhou) of Gansu Province belong to this region. The annual rainfall is reduced to below 200 millimeters, making it a desert zone. Because it is located in the center of the continent, the changes in cold and heat in winter and summer are extremely drastic. Most of the waterways end in salt lakes, which is called the endorheic region. Mongolia and Xinjiang have different terrains. The mountains in Xinjiang are higher and surrounded on all sides, so the basin shape is particularly prominent. The northern part of the Tianshan Mountains is called the Junggar Basin, and the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains is called the Tarim Basin. The Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province forms a long corridor shape due to the confrontation between the north and south mountains, which are all alpine regions. Mongolia, on the other hand, has a vast and flat plateau, with low and scattered mountains. Only the Kobdo area and Uriankhai show signs of a basin. This region belongs to the desert zone in terms of climate. There are very few and very sparse plants, and barren red land is more common than places where plants grow. The residents of this region all live in fertile areas around the desert, which are called water and grass fields, scattered like islands in the sea, so they are also called sand islands. They rely on camel caravans to connect them. These fertile fields are irrigated by the trickling of snow water from the high mountains. White poplar and willow trees are planted around the villages or along the canals, which are quite lush from a distance. Crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, and silk, locally speaking, are quite abundant. Fruits such as grapes and watermelons are particularly well-known in the world. As for the high mountain areas, there are also forests where the rainfall is above 100 millimeters, such as the fir trees (i.e., cedar and pine) on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, which are the most famous. Outside of Kulun, Outer Mongolia is affected by the remaining moisture of the Arctic Ocean and has entered the Siberian forest zone. On the waterways, it also belongs to the Arctic Ocean system. The ethnic groups in this region are quite complex. Most of Outer Mongolia is Mongolian, with some Han merchants. In the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains, the four ethnic groups of Han, Hui, Mongolian, and Kazakh live together. In the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains, the two ethnic groups of Han and Hui live together. Major cities have Han and Hui cities. The Hexi Corridor is mainly inhabited by Han Chinese. Since ancient times, it has been an important route for land transportation in Central Asia and is extremely important in national defense.</p>
<p>Tibet Region: This region includes Tibet, Xikang, Qinghai, and the bordering areas of Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. The average elevation is above 3,000 meters, and the surrounding areas have high snow-capped mountains above 5,000 meters. In winter, the temperature throughout Tibet is far below freezing. In summer, only the lower plateaus in the south have an average temperature above freezing for five or six months. In most of Tibet, the rainfall is similar to that in the grassland region. Generally speaking, this region is a cold desert. It is not completely rainless, but most of the small amount of rain falls as snow. The highest place in this region is northern Tibet, with an altitude of 5,000 meters. It is all barren mountains and poor valleys, and barren land. The source of the Yangtze River and the Qinghai coast have wide grasslands that are suitable for grazing. As for the valleys of the Jiang River tributaries, such as Xining in Qinghai and Ba'an in Xikang, the elevation is lower (but it is the highest among the provincial capitals in the country), and agriculture is gradually flourishing. Lhasa, Tibet, is located in a river valley at an altitude of 3,000 meters, and its residents also engage in farming. The most common crop in this region is highland barley, a cold-resistant barley. Another animal that represents this region is the yak, which is extremely cold-resistant. If the camel is called the ship of the desert, the yak can also be called the ship of the cold desert. Wherever there is highland barley and ploughing yaks, that is the range of nomadic Tibetan tribes, which is a significant example of the relationship between people and land.</p>

<h3>Brokers Discuss Remedial Measures for Cash Delivery Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Due to the Ministry of Finance's order that all transactions of public bonds in January on the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange must be delivered in cash and no rolling over allowed, brokers, caught off guard, found it particularly difficult to deliver in cash for entrusted transactions from other cities and arbitrage trading. Therefore, they convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss remedial measures. Most bond prices rose sharply after trading began. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brokers Association Meeting Yesterday: Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange Brokers Association convened a meeting on the eighth floor of the exchange. All brokers attended. He Peiyuan was elected chairman to discuss the Ministry's order for cash delivery. It was generally agreed that the Ministry's order must be obeyed, but the reality could not be ignored. For those entrusted to sell from other cities, the cash was not in Shanghai, and for those engaged in arbitrage, buying in the near term and selling in the long term, neither had cash to deliver. Therefore, He Peiyuan, Zhu Anfu, and Qiu Lianggui were elected as representatives to present their opinions to the board of directors, requesting them to appeal to the Ministry of Finance for understanding. Apart from those who could deliver in cash, those with genuine difficulties should be allowed a grace period to remedy the situation. It is reported that the board of directors has agreed to make representations to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Market Announcement of Cash Delivery: Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market issued an announcement stating, "Having received a Ministry order, from the 29th of this month onwards, sellers must deliver all bond transactions in cash. For all transactions made by sellers before the 29th of this month, they should also send the bonds to the exchange to complete cash delivery," etc.</p>
<p>Most Bond Prices Rose After Opening: Yesterday morning, after the bond market opened, prices were firm due to the requirement for cash delivery. Although some fell, most continued to rise. The final settlement in the afternoon was delayed until 6:00 PM due to the brokers' association meeting, which was a special event. As for the January deliveries, they could have been settled the day before, but had to be postponed for a day or two due to the requirement for cash delivery. Therefore, although the January deliveries were not completely settled yesterday, trading had stopped. Since the March issues must be traded after delivery, only February cash issues were traded in the market yesterday. Although there were many buying in, many real goods were also released.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Ordered to Establish: Released Prisoner Protection Association, Jiangsu High Court Orders Second Special Prison to Organize, Warden Sends Letters Requesting Assistance from Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court believes that the protection of released prisoners is closely related to preventing recidivism and maintaining social stability. Therefore, it has specifically instructed the Second Special Prison of Jiangsu and Shanghai to effectively organize a Released Prisoner Protection Association. After receiving the order, Prison Warden Sun Xiong sent letters to various charitable organizations in the city, including the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, yesterday, requesting assistance to jointly plan the undertaking. The original letter and the outline of the protection association's organization are recorded below:</p>
<p>Prison Official Letter: Respectfully, in accordance with the instructions from the Fourth Division of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Court Order No. 401, we received instructions from the Judicial Yuan, Order No. 717, forwarding the resolutions of the Judicial Conference regarding the establishment of the Released Prisoner Protection Association, instructing us to investigate and comply. Considering the importance of protecting released prisoners, this department previously promulgated the Rules for Rewarding Released Prisoner Protection Affairs on February 5, 1930, to actively promote the cause. On October 18, 1932, we formulated the Organizational Outline of the Released Prisoner Protection Association, which has been followed. Recently, we have found that only a few provinces have reported the establishment of such associations. We hereby issue a reminder, urging you to supervise the wardens of the new prisons to actively promote the organization of the association by local charitable organizations, and to supervise the cooperation of the county prison coordination committees to promote and popularize the initiative. This is imperative, etc. Upon receiving this order, we were instructed to comply and effectively implement it. Considering that the protection of released prisoners is closely related to preventing recidivism and has a significant impact on social security and national prosperity, Shanghai has long been known for its wealth, but in recent years, its economy has declined, all industries have withered, and unemployment has increased, leading to a growing number of people committing crimes and entering prison. Fortunately, upon their release, their reputation is tarnished, they lack the means to make a living, and recidivism is rampant. The establishment of the Released Prisoner Protection Association is imperative. We have long admired your forest for its courage and righteousness. We hereby record the order, and enclose the Rules for Rewarding Released Prisoner Protection Affairs and the Organizational Outline of the Released Prisoner Protection Association for your review. We hope that you will contribute your great wisdom and jointly promote the undertaking, generously open your purses, and together support the cause. We earnestly look forward to your response.</p>
<p>Organizational Outline: The purpose of the Released Prisoner Protection Association is to protect those who have completed their sentences, are released on parole or bail, and enable them to achieve success. Those released prisoners who are destitute and have no means of support but have genuine evidence of reform can enjoy the following protection: Introduction: Introduce them to various places based on their skills. Transportation: If a released prisoner is from another province and must return home, efforts should be made to provide transportation. Assistance: Provide loans for food and clothing, which they can repay after finding employment. Investigation: Conduct regular investigations into their conduct, etc., to provide guidance. Those who are willing to fulfill their obligations in accordance with the purpose of the Released Prisoner Protection Association are members. Those who provide financial support and assist in all activities are supporting members. They may pay a one-time membership fee of five yuan or an annual membership fee of one yuan. Members pay an entrance fee of one yuan, but those who wish to provide special assistance are not subject to this limit. The Released Prisoner Protection Association elects the following officers to perform their respective duties: A certain number of directors, a certain number of staff. In order to understand the released prisoner's personal relationships, behavior during imprisonment, and hopes upon release, the staff of the Released Prisoner Protection Association may visit the prison at any time and request to meet with prisoners. The establishment of the Released Prisoner Protection Association should be carried out in accordance with the procedures for establishing civil organizations promulgated by the central government. At the end of each year, the Released Prisoner Protection Association should submit its protection achievements to the High Court of each province for transmission to the Ministry of Judicial Administration.</p>
<p>Reward Rules: Article 1: Those who handle the affairs of protecting released prisoners shall be rewarded in accordance with these rules. Article 2: Rewards are divided into the following two categories: (A) Those who have handled the affairs mentioned in the previous article for more than three years with outstanding achievements, or who have donated more than one thousand silver dollars, shall be given a certificate of commendation. (B) Those who have handled the affairs mentioned in the previous article for more than five years with outstanding achievements, or who have donated more than five thousand silver dollars, shall be given a plaque. Article 3: The wardens of the prisons in the previous article shall submit the applications for each reward to the supervisory authority for transmission to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification. Article 4: The petitions submitted by the wardens shall separately record the following items: (a) Regarding those who handle affairs: The age and origin of the handler, the process of handling and future plans, the number of years and achievements of handling. (b) Regarding those who donate silver dollars: The age and origin of the donor, the amount of silver dollars donated.

<h3>Lu Zuofu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Negotiating the Mortgage of Sichuan Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Shiye News Agency reports: Lu Zuofu, Director of the Department of Construction of Sichuan Province, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chongqing route. He is staying at the Minsheng Industrial Company. According to reporters' inquiries, in addition to inspecting the company's business and planning this year's improvements and developments, Lu's visit is also because the province's Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been ordered to begin construction by Chairman Chiang, and 50 million yuan in public bonds will be issued to be used for road construction funds. Financial assistance from Shanghai is urgently needed, and he plans to visit the authorities of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank today to negotiate the mortgage of these public bonds.</p>
<h3>China National Industries Association Organizes Southwest Industrial Inspection Tour: Inviting Leaders from Domestic Industrial and Commercial Circles to Participate, Qian Chengxu Talks About the Motives and Objectives of This Action</h3>
<p>The China National Industries Association in Shanghai has formally accepted the invitation of the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments and will organize a Southwest Industrial Inspection Tour, following the precedent of the Shandong Inspection Tour two years ago. Leaders from domestic industrial and commercial circles will be invited to participate, and the tour is scheduled to depart no later than the 25th of next month. The tour is expected to stay in Guangdong and Guangxi for two weeks to conduct inspections, and then return to Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed Qian Chengxu, Secretary-General of the Association, yesterday to inquire about the motives and objectives of this trip. His detailed answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Departure Motivation: According to Qian, in March of last year, Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, sent Yang Zhuoan, Director of the Provincial Bureau of Industry and Commerce, to Shanghai to visit leaders of the Shanghai industrial community to discuss the issue of Guangxi's use of domestic goods. At the same time, he delivered a letter from Chairman Huang to the Association, inviting colleagues to visit Guangxi to see the province's various construction projects. In April of the same year, Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and Yang Zhuoan, Director of the Guangxi Bureau of Industry and Commerce, came to Shanghai together to represent the Guangdong Provincial Government and visit the Association, also expressing the same invitation. Since then, personal letters between Shanghai and Guangdong have been frequent, but leaders from both places have regretted not having the opportunity to meet each other. Later, in December of last year, Zou Haibin, Huang Xuchu, Huang Jilu, and others visited Shanghai at the same time. The Association led them to visit various factories, and they were all impressed. Before leaving, they repeatedly reiterated their previous invitations, so the Association promised to gather colleagues together in February of this year to visit the scenic spots of Guangdong and Guangxi, and to reciprocate the warm invitations of the two provinces. The Association has issued a notice, hoping that most colleagues can participate and go.</p>
<p>Inspection Objectives: In recent years, China has faced many national crises. The domestic goods market has undergone many changes, the sales channels for goods have narrowed, and the lifeline of domestic goods is difficult to maintain. Guangdong and Guangxi do not manufacture cotton yarn, flour, or other products due to time and geographical reasons. All their needs depend on foreign goods. Therefore, as long as the production areas plan, promote, and cooperate to lay a foundation, the future of domestic goods will greatly benefit. After colleagues arrive in Guangdong, they will conduct a thorough inspection and study of the current status of production and consumption in various parts of the southwest, so that after returning north, they can contribute the results of their inspections to major manufacturers in Shanghai for reference, striving to establish close ties between industry and economy in the southwest and Shanghai, so that production and consumption in both places can meet supply and demand.</p>
<p>Letter of Invitation: The Association sent a letter to leaders in the industrial and commercial circles yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, last spring, colleagues from our Association were invited by the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments to go south to inspect industries and constructions and connect the industrial economy between the southwest and Shanghai. Although many people participated later, the departure times of each person were not consistent, and the trip could not be made. Last winter, Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi Province, and Zou Lu, President of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, came to Shanghai one after another and reiterated their previous invitations, and hoped that colleagues could provide concrete plans for the domestic goods market on this trip to facilitate their promotion. In addition to being grateful for the kindness of Zou and Huang, colleagues from our Association deeply feel that it is necessary to promote domestic goods in the southwest. Therefore, it was decided to organize the tour of Guangdong and Guangxi following the organization of the Shandong Inspection Tour two years ago, to visit the scenic spots of the two places. The departure date is set for between February 25 and February 30 of this year, and the inspection period will be no more than two weeks at the latest. All procedures will be notified in a separate letter at that time. We have long known that you care about industry and have a burning enthusiasm. We are sending this letter specifically, hoping that you will join us. If you agree, please reply in advance so that we can inform the authorities of the two provinces."</p>
<p>List of Invitees: The association has sent letters of invitation to the following individuals: Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Wang Yaochen, Zhu Jingan, Yang Jingshi, Hu Juewen, Zhu Gengtao, Zhang Zemin, Li Yanshi, Wang Yinqiao, Wang Yunwu, Wang Qiyu, Ji Jiannan, Wang Boqi, Wu Yun Chu, Hu Xiyuan, Qian Chengxu, Yao Xizhou, Yan Yousan, Lu Feibo Hong, Lao Jingxiu, Cai Sheng Bai, Dai Gengxin, Yan Qingxiang, Liu Jingji, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xue Fuji, Li Yuancheng, Gu Xinyi, Sun Zhongwu, Cheng Nianpeng, Zhang Huikang, Ren Shigang, Ding Zhixiang, Zhang Shoupeng, Liu Liqing, Rong Desheng, Cai Jiansan, Qian Fenghao, Mu Jingtang, Liu Piji, Tu Gongfu, Fei Liangsheng, Zhan Jingtang, Chen Jiefu, Wu Bosheng, Lu Zhitian, Yao Zuobin, Yin Zhizhong, Zhou Zixi, Miao Jicun, Ma Bosheng, Zhou Baiming, Yang Wenshen, Liu Guojun, Yan Yutang, Xu Zhiyi, Rong Yingsheng.</p>

<h3>Two-Tenths Increase in Freight Rates for All Shipping Lines; Shanghai-Ningbo Line Implemented First; China Merchants, Four Allied Companies Announced</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the worldwide economic downturn on China's shipping industry, the Shanghai Shipping Association requested the issuance of shipping industry bonds. However, due to the lack of funding, the request was repeatedly rejected by the government. To save the declining industry, a general meeting resolved to increase freight rates by 20% on all routes starting from New Year's Day in the 25th year of the Republic of China and to find ways to implement it. Now, the Shanghai-Ningbo line has been scheduled to implement this on February 1st.

<h3>Specially Built by the Dutch Royal Company: Three Fast Mail Ships to Central and Southern Africa; 12,000-ton Class</h3>
<p>There have never been direct mail ships from Shanghai to South Africa. Since last year, when the Dutch Royal Steamship Company extended the routes of six of its East and South Africa combined shipping vessels to Shanghai, Shanghai has had direct flights to Central Africa. The length of this route is unique in the Far East. Now, due to business development, the company is specially building three new express mail ships to exclusively operate between Shanghai and South Africa. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Specially Built Fast Ships</p>
<p>The Dutch Royal Mail Steamer Company K.P.M. Line (Royal Packet Nav. Co.) has been operating six ships, including the Houwen, Deswen, and Logiven, with a capacity of 5,000 tons since last year, sailing to Shanghai, Java, South Africa, and returning via East Africa. Business has been good. Passengers and cargo can be directly shipped between Central and South Africa. Only this company has ships on this route, and there are no other competing companies. Therefore, the Dutch Royal Mail Steamer Company has decided to develop this route into a formal mail ship service, abolish the six old ships, and specially build three new express ships to exclusively operate on the Shanghai-South Africa route, emphasizing both passenger and cargo transportation.</p>
<p>New Mail Ship Layout</p>
<p>The three express mail ships on the Central Africa route have been decided by the Dutch Royal Company to have a net carrying capacity of 12,000 tons each and to be constructed with the latest world-class structure, engine fuel, and excellent passenger accommodation. Special attention is paid to heat protection equipment, as they are specifically designed for tropical routes, allowing passengers to enjoy coolness on board. Each ship will have 83 first-class cabins and 90 second-class cabins, with larger cabins to provide passengers with more space. The engine horsepower will be specially increased, with a minimum speed of 17 nautical miles per hour, and the speed can be increased when necessary.</p>
<p>Decision on Naming</p>
<p>The names of the three mail ships have been discussed by the company several times and decided to use the names of the most famous Dutch shipping merchants as ship names: One is the Ruys, another is Tegelberg, and the third is Boissevain. All three ships will operate in Shanghai. The interior of the three ships is like a sea palace. It is said that the cost is about 20 million Chinese yuan, which shows the solidity of the hull and the magnificence of the equipment.</p>
<p>Route Has Been Assigned</p>
<p>These three mail ships are the formal route between Shanghai and South Africa, sailing once a month. The route that has been agreed upon is from Shanghai to Little Luzon, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Mauritius, Lourenco, Marques to Durban, East London, via Port Elizabeth to Mossel Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and returning via Tamtavi and Reunion, Rodriguez, and then to the South Sea Islands before coming to China.</p>
<h3>Fu Rulin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Meet Kong</h3>
<p>Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and Director of the Economic Research Office of the Central Bank, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 7 a.m. yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went straight to his residence for a rest, then went to the Central Bank to handle important official matters, and met with Finance Minister Kong to report and request instructions.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Minister to China; Lacorte Delayed Arrival in Shanghai; Expected to Arrive on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Brazilian Minister to China, Lacorte, arrived in China to take office. According to the message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office yesterday, Lacorte was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday on the Changxing Company's Russian Queen ship. However, due to a slight indisposition en route, he landed in Japan for a short rest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was notified by telegram, and it was rescheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Daolai Company's President McKinley ship on the 3rd of next month. At that time, the deputy directors of the Foreign Affairs Office, Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, will, together with representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai, Branco, go to the ship to welcome him. Lacorte will rest briefly after arriving in Shanghai and then proceed to Beijing to meet Foreign Minister Zhang to discuss the date of presenting his credentials. He will then be seen by Chairman Lin after approval.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Holds Police Chief Exam; Examination System Implemented for Future Appointments</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, noted that among the police chiefs in the city, there are quite a few who work diligently and abide by the law. He ordered the directors of each branch bureau to recommend outstanding police chiefs for promotion. A total of 150 police chiefs recommended by the directors of each branch bureau took the police chief exam at the police training center the other day. As a result, outstanding police chiefs Du Yongmao, Hu Min, Zhang Huixiang, He Lin, Jiang Tianqian, Xuan Shanjun, Yang Jihua, Cao Zhen, Song Kuitong, Zhu Jiapu, Xing Xiaoshun, Chen Yiqing, Xuan Guowei, Zhou Junfu, Zhu Donghe, Hu Gang, Li Daorong, Lü Shoushan, Gu Weixuan, Shen Ronghua, and 20 others were selected. This exam was extremely strict. In addition to testing academic subjects, it also focused on their usual work performance and conduct. After Director Cai personally inquired about each person in detail, they were all promoted to probationary patrol officers. The first three, Du Yongmao, Hu Chongmin, and Zhang Huixiang, were immediately assigned as patrol officers to the Laobeimen Police Station and the Wenmiao Road Police Station. The rest will be promoted as vacancies arise. It is heard that Director Cai will use people based on talent and implement an examination system in the future. Police officers will be promoted to police chiefs, police chiefs will be promoted to patrol officers, patrol officers will be promoted to section members and bureau members, etc., and promotions will be made by grade, so that every police officer has the opportunity to be promoted in order to reward a group of police officers who abide by the law and work hard. It is said that this is the first time in the history of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau that police chiefs have been promoted to patrol officers.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Municipal Government Cables Shanghai to Request Suppression of the Exchange Rate Difference for Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a cable from the Hangzhou Municipal Government yesterday, stating that, according to the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the exchange of silver subsidiary currency in Hangzhou follows the Ministry's regulations of 12 jiao of silver subsidiary currency per 1 yuan of legal tender. The association convened a meeting to determine the method and repeatedly announced it. Most of the exchange merchants can comply, and the citizens also find it convenient. Now, according to the silver coin industry, the stock of silver subsidiary currency in Hangzhou is thinning out. Upon inquiry, it is learned that in Shanghai, each yuan of legal tender is only exchanged for about 10 jiao of silver subsidiary currency and 20 copper coins, which is a huge difference. Hangzhou and Shanghai are close, and there are many people traveling back and forth. Even according to the legal number, each person is only allowed to carry 50 jiao, which is already a considerable amount. Moreover, it is inevitable that unscrupulous merchants will buy a large amount and smuggle it for profit. In this situation, the outflow of silver subsidiary currency in Hangzhou is increasing, and the original exchange method may not be able to be maintained. Therefore, this cable requests your government to quickly instruct the method for compliance and requests to send a cable to the Shanghai Municipal Government of the Ministry of Finance to suppress the number of exchanges in the north of the city, so as to be consistent and avoid division. The telegraph is solemn and urgent, etc. Based on this, in addition to the instructions and separate telegrams, we hereby send a telegram to your government to check and quickly order the investigation and suppression to maintain the market and stabilize it, and hope to see a reply, etc. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly investigate and suppress it with the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Adds "Gold" to the Rules for Inspecting Issuance Reserves</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee yesterday, stating that the inspection rules for the Issuance Reserve Management Committee formulated by the Ministry were sent on December 23, 24th year of the Republic of China for reference and distributed to all sub-committees for compliance. Now, upon inspection, the word "silver" in the phrase "current silver" in Article 5 of the rules (such as existing currency and silver in the warehouse) is missing the word "gold". Correspondingly, please check and add the correction and inform all sub-committees to comply with the addition of the correction.</p>
<h3>The Machine Industry Association Delegation Departed Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation specially invited factory employees to organize a tour group due to the importance of factory safety and hygiene at the Industrial Ah Nuan Exhibition held by the Ministry in Beijing. Participants included Cai Shengbai of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Hu Xiyuan of Yapu Er, Wu Yun Chu of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, and Ji Jiannan of Wuzhou Lu Zhixue Sanyou Industrial Society, totaling more than 20 people. They have now completed preparations and took the special express train to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. yesterday (29th), led by Secretary-General Cheng Shouchu for a visit.</p>
<h3>Representatives from This City Departed Yesterday to Attend the Rural Economic Conference in Anhui Province; Including Zou Bingwen and Five Others</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has specially invited bankers and agricultural experts from Beijing and Shanghai to develop agriculture and revive the rural economy, and has scheduled to convene a rural economic discussion meeting in Wuhu on the 30th and 31st of this month. It is learned that the banking industry in this city has appointed Li Zhongsi, Wu Shengguo, Zou Bingwen from Shanghai, Wang Zhixin from Xinhua, and expert Yang Yinpu to participate. As the conference date is approaching, the representatives took a special train to Beijing yesterday afternoon and departed for Wuhu with the representatives from Beijing to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Telephone Problem Conference Decides to Petition the French Municipal Council; Qu Zhenhua and Two Others are Appointed as Representatives</h3>
<p>The price increase of telephone in the concession is imminent. The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee has repeatedly gathered to discuss and negotiate with the Public Works Bureau. Although the Director-General Zhong Si of the Bureau promised a written reply, the Committee has not yet received it. It was previously reported that the Committee sent Gu Wensheng and others to negotiate with the French Municipal Council yesterday morning. As the representatives had not been appointed in advance, they did not petition yesterday. As the implementation of the new system is imminent, the Committee has appointed Qu Zhenhua, Kui, and Gu Wensheng as representatives to prepare a document within this week to the French Concession Municipal Council and negotiate with the Director-General. The purpose is to reconsider the price increase and to consider the welfare of the public during this period of economic downturn when various industries are declining, instead of only thinking about the interests of the company.</p>
<h3>French Air Attaché to China, Fei Shizhe, Returns to France to Report for Duty; And Request Instructions on Sino-French Air Transport Matters</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Colonel Fei Shizhe, French Air Attaché to the Chinese Embassy, previously served to negotiate Sino-French air transport matters with China, which is mostly completed. He is now returning to his country for a trip, going south from Peiping, and then taking the Daolai Company's President Coolidge ship, via the United States, and transferring to France to report to the government and give instructions.</p>
<h3>The Masters Association Requests the Cancellation of the Ban on Crew Members Getting On and Off Ships at Songkou</h3>
<p>The Masters Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications, stating that the request is to consult the Ministry of Finance and order the Shanghai Customs to quickly cancel the ban on passengers and crew members from freely boarding and disembarking ships at Wusongkou in order to facilitate transportation. Since the Customs issued the order in the 23rd year of the Republic of China that all Chinese ships hiring Yangtze River pilots must be commissioned by the Customs, the Customs banned crew members and passengers from boarding and disembarking ships freely at Wusongkou in order to prevent shipowners from taking advantage of the opportunity of passengers and crew members boarding and disembarking ships to privately hire pilots. However, Wusongkou is an important transportation hub for water and land. Hundreds of ships come and go every day, either sailing from the Yangtze River to overseas or from overseas to the Yangtze River. There are not a few passengers and crew members who want to leave Shanghai to take ships at Songkou or leave ships at Songkou to go to Shanghai. They have always been able to board and disembark ships freely and are not subject to legal restrictions. Now, in order to prevent shipowners from privately hiring Yangtze River pilots, the Customs requires passengers and crew members who want to board and disembark ships to apply for a pass to be allowed to pass, which is to partially block the important transportation hub for water and land and disregard the convenience of the people. This is not only asking people to cut their feet to fit the shoes, but also reaching one of the four major policies of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Is this the ultimate intention of national legislation? Moreover, the Customs has banned shipowners from privately hiring Yangtze River pilots, and those who violate the ban should be subject to appropriate punishment. Now, the convenience of transportation for the people is deprived, which is a very inappropriate measure. Since the Customs implemented this semi-blockade policy, the business of our country's small ships in Wusongkou has suddenly declined, and most of the small ships seen are flying foreign flags, which has an impact on international concepts. It is urgent to present this request to the Ministry of Finance and order the Shanghai Customs to quickly cancel the ban on passengers and crew members from freely boarding and disembarking ships at Wusongkou in order to facilitate transportation. This is in the public interest.</p>
<h3>The City's National Goods Year Conference Asks All Associations to Work Hard to Promote Them</h3>
<p>The City's National Goods Year Sports Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking them to order their affiliated associations to work hard to promote national goods. The original text stated: The National Goods Year for Women, the National Goods Year for Students, etc. in the past can be said to have achieved little. This year's National Goods Year for Citizens is a whole Shanghai citizen movement. My colleagues learn from the past and think that most ordinary citizens blindly follow and are passive. If stores can promote more national goods and have more opportunities to come into contact with citizens, then citizens will believe in and buy national goods. This is the most fundamental way to promote them. Therefore, we specifically ask your association to inform all industry associations to urge members to promote national goods in order to show promotion and encourage each other. The citizens are very fortunate, and the national goods are very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Starting from the 1st of Next Month, the 43rd Train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Will Stop at Anting Station; Cancellation of Stop at Tianfu'an Station</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the two railway bureaus, starting from February 1st, the 43rd Shanghai-Zhenjiang 3rd and 4th class section train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway (departing from Zhenjiang West Station at 10:00 a.m.) will add a two-minute stop at Anting Station (arriving at 4:18 p.m. and departing at 4:20 p.m.), and tickets to and from the station will be sold. Starting from the same day, the 43rd train will cancel the stop at Tianfu'an Station.</p>

<h3>German Female Writer, Maga Tissen, Returns to Shanghai; The Husband is Dutch and Has Therefore Changed Nationality; The Consulate is Investigating the Source of the Rumors</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the report that a German female writer, Maga Tissen, was killed near Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou has been proven to be completely false. Furthermore, Ms. Maga safely returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. According to the investigation, although the lady was born in Germany, she is now of Dutch nationality because she is married to a Dutchman. She is currently a reporter for a German newspaper in Shanghai. The truth about the rumors that occurred the day before yesterday has been transferred from the German Consulate General in Shanghai to the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai for investigation. The Dutch Consulate has sent staff to visit Ms. Maga once yesterday. The Consulate will release news today.</p>
<h3>Silver Industry to Hold Meeting Next Month to Discuss Silver Fineness</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of silver fineness used by silver shops nationwide, the Silver Shop Association of this city has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to find a solution. In order to sympathize with the business difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to allow 30% adulteration of silver and has instructed the Chamber of Commerce of this city to transfer the consultation to the Association for processing according to the law. According to Mr. Chuan Shengmao, chairman of the Association, the method approved by the Ministry of Finance, although more than the silver content stipulated in the past, still cannot manufacture fine utensils. Silverware in our country is valued for its fine carvings. If the silver content is reduced, the hardness will increase, which will inevitably be difficult to carve and lose its inherent beauty. Furthermore, the silver shop industry is based on selling silverware. If the silver content is reduced to 30%, there will only be the name of selling silver but not the reality of selling silver, and the business will inevitably be affected, even to the point of being unable to maintain it. Therefore, the industry still cannot comply with the revised method of the Ministry of Finance and has scheduled a general meeting of members at the Association on the 1st of next month to discuss the request for another method.</p>
<h3>After Final Settlement, the Silk Industry Has Made Considerable Profits; Each Silk Shop Opened Yesterday; Silk Factories Will Also Start Work Tomorrow or the Day After</h3>
<p>The silk industry in this city declined sharply in the first half of last year. However, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the currency system reform, sales in various places have been very smooth. As a result of the final settlement at the end of the lunar year, each silk shop and silk factory has made a profit. A reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the silk market yesterday that when silk prices in this city plummeted before last autumn, each silk shop purchased a huge amount of goods, and the costs were quite low. Each silk shop hoarded a large amount of inventory between August and September. After October, foreign sales gradually moved, and prices rose sharply. After the Ministry of Finance implemented the currency system reform in November, the selling price rose even more sharply, breaking the new record of recent years. In terms of customers, the Sichuan group had the best sales, followed by Hubei, Jiangxi, and various provinces in South China. Although the situation in this street was worse, the larger shops such as Lao Jiu and Dashengfu and dozens of others hoarded more inventory and made quite a lot of profit. According to statistics, after the final settlement of each silk shop and silk factory in this city, the results are rare in recent years. Each silk shop is accustomed to closing for five days during the Lunar New Year and opened yesterday. Each silk factory will also start work tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3>The Dean of the Shanghai West Plain People's Maternity Hospital Was Accused of Fraud by Students; The Hospital Had No Equipment and Was Not Registered; The Dean Said that the Students Violated the Rules and Were Expelled; —The Court Judge Will Visit the Hospital for Inspection Tomorrow—</h3>
<p>Chen Pixian, a Ningbo native, the dean of the Shanghai West Plain People's Maternity Hospital at No. 112 Maigen Road, was recently accused of fraud by Li Bin, a Zhenjiang native, a former intern at the hospital residing at No. 13 Shuntai Lane, Wuding Road, in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce interrogated him in the Fifth Criminal Court. In addition to defending himself, Chen Pixian also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. Li Bin claimed that the defendant posted an advertisement on August 7 last year to recruit interns. I saw the advertisement in my hometown and came to Shanghai to take the exam. At that time, the defendant said that he would register with the Health Bureau, so I paid two years of board and lodging fees. However, after entering the hospital, there were no formal teachers to teach, and there was no registration certificate. There were only one or two prescriptions. I felt that if this continued, I would waste my precious time. I dropped out of school on December 22, and the fees paid were not refunded. I presented the case to the Health Bureau to investigate whether the hospital was registered, and the reply was that it was not registered. Moreover, the hospital equipment was quite incomplete, and there were no formal doctors, so I filed a complaint. Chen Pixian replied that he lived at No. 112 Maigen Road and was originally the Hongkou Maternity Hospital. I was a doctor there. On August 15 last year, I took over and changed it to the Shanghai West Plain People's Hospital. The plaintiff was indeed a student recruited by the Shanghai West Plain Maternity Hospital and paid a fee of 100 yuan. According to the regulations, he practiced during the day and taught at night, taught by Dr. Shan Xue. There are currently four male students and seven female students. The plaintiff was expelled for violating school rules, engaging in improper behavior with female students, and privately stamping the accounting seal. As for the registration, it is currently in preparation. In addition to the two doctors from Nanjing specializing in eye and lung diseases, there are also two doctors in this hospital. The plaintiff's accusations are not true. I submit the charter and the plaintiff's love letter to a female student's syllabus, etc. to prove it. Student Song Jinghui proved that the plaintiff was indeed expelled for violating school rules. Judge Zhan believed that it was necessary to visit the hospital to inspect the case and scheduled to visit it at 10:00 a.m. on the 31st of this month and set another date for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Heavy Sentences for Two Women in Private Sale of Red Pills Case; Three Taels of Red Pills Sentenced to Twelve Years; The First Special Court Deals Strictly with Drug Cases</h3>
<p>Since the First Special District Court began handling smoking and drug cases in accordance with the regulations on punishing smoking and drug crimes, it has been half a month, and no drug offenders sentenced have been given heavier sentences. Until yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui sentenced two cases of selling red pills. The sentences given to the principals were unprecedented. When Judge Liu read the sentence, he told the woman selling red pills, Zhou Jin, that according to the law, she should be sentenced to death. Now, considering that the number of red pills seized was small, only three taels, so she was given a lighter sentence of twelve years of imprisonment. The principal in another case was also a woman, Wang Abao. Not only did the woman sell red pills, but she was also addicted to them herself. Therefore, the court also sentenced her to twelve years of imprisonment for the crime of private sale and three years of imprisonment for the crime of private smoking, with a combined sentence of thirteen years. Wu, who was privately smoking red pills at Wang's place, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and ordered to be sent to a hospital for compulsory rehabilitation together with Wang. Since the court implemented the new regulations, there have been several smokers sent to the hospital for compulsory rehabilitation every day. There are no public drug rehabilitation centers in the Public Concession, so the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's smoking cessation hospital sends a car every morning to the First Special Court to transport the criminals sentenced to compulsory rehabilitation to the hospital for rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao's Calligraphy Helps with Relief</h3>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, sent a letter to the flood relief associations in various provinces yesterday, stating that he thanked the associations for their kindness in requesting Mr. Xiang Bo to donate his calligraphy. This winter, Xian and his son will also follow the example of previous years and do their best to provide assistance to the capital, Luoyang, Chang'an, Wugong, and his hometown of Wuxing, as well as the ancestral tomb in Guanghan, where he is registered. He does not dare to say that he is giving, but only to comfort his unbearable heart. He has also given a small amount to the children in the disaster areas of Jiangsu and Shandong. The total amount is beyond what Xian can afford. He respectfully accepts and thanks the elder Mr. Xiang's calligraphy, but does not dare to offer money or silk to disrespect the respected elder of the nation. He asks the colleagues of the association to understand. He offers eight screen strips, with a proposed price of 340 yuan, and a small couplet, with a proposed price of 40 yuan. They were originally hung in the room to warn and encourage himself, but now they are donated to the winter relief association to help in a small way. If there are kind people who are willing to develop a great Bodhi mind and donate both wealth and Dharma, then the wish to attract jade is not a tiger. Sincerely wish you good fortune. Dai Chuanxian.</p>
<h3>The Wet Nurse in the Kang Nanshan Family Stole Money and Set Fire; Cried for Help After Setting the Fire; The Original Loot Was Copied from the Cotton Pants</h3>
<p>Kang Nanshan, a 25-year-old Ningbo native, resident of No. 1311 Caojiadu Town, Shanghai West, works as a salesman at the Laogongmao Foreign Firm in the Public Concession. His family is well-off, and his parents are alive. His 58-year-old mother, Qin, and the wet nurse, Cai Hu, a 27-year-old Yangzhou native, who was hired a month ago after Kang's wife gave birth to twins, slept together in the west-facing living room. A few days ago, the wet nurse saw the owner bring 500 yuan in banknotes from outside and hide them.</p>
<h3>Fire at Tan Jia Bridge: Elderly Employee Dies, Chiang Chin-chung Throws Incense Stick After Drinking, Destroying Eight Rooms and Causing Five Thousand in Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around two o'clock, a fire suddenly broke out in the goods warehouse of the Fuxing Silk Weaving Factory, owned by Shao, located behind the tile-roofed bungalows of the Dehe Electric Silk Weaving Factory on the eastern end of Tan Jia Bridge, Zhabei. Officers from the Tan Jia Bridge Police Station of the Xin Zha Branch Bureau and the Pengpu Security Corps heard about it and telephoned the Fire Brigade, which dispatched fire trucks and ambulances to extinguish the blaze. The fire was extinguished by a little after three o'clock. Later investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was an elderly employee of the factory, named Chiang Chin-chung, 59 years old, from Huzhou. Taking advantage of the factory's New Year holiday shutdown, Chiang drank and got drunk in the warehouse, throwing an incense stick into a pile of waste paper, causing the fire. He panicked and was unable to extinguish it. At the time, the factory's gatekeeper, named Zhao A-liu, was awakened from his sleep and tried to drag Chiang Chin-chung out, but Chiang stubbornly refused, leading to his death in the fire. His abdomen was ruptured, his intestines spilled out, and he was burned to a crisp. When the fire was raging, the Tan Jia Bridge Police Station took Zhao A-liu to the police station and sent him to the Xin Zha Branch Bureau for questioning. At the same time, the local Baojia leader, Tan Mao-kun, was instructed to report the matter to the Shanghai Local Court for inspection. Around four o'clock in the afternoon, prosecutor Xiao Jin-ying, clerk Zhang Guo-huai, and coroner Shen, etc., arrived at the scene. They examined the body and determined that the deceased, Chiang Chin-chung, had indeed been burned to death. The body was handed over to the factory to prepare a coffin for burial. The deceased had a younger sister who worked as a servant in the Shao family and had no children. Yesterday, it was seen that the factory had a total of eight tile-roofed bungalows destroyed, including a machine. According to the person in charge, Mr. Shen, the total loss was five thousand yuan. Fortunately, they had fire insurance. As for Zhao A-liu, who was detained, he is 60 years old, also from Huzhou, and a fellow villager of the factory owner.</p>
<h3>Mother's Helper Commits Arson After Theft: Cai Clan Arrested by Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>In a certain Westerner's home, No. 5, Lane 120, Peikai'er Road, Eastern Shanghai, a Yangchow native named He Wei-qun, 22 years old, was employed as a houseboy. He performed his duties diligently and was deeply appreciated by his employer. His mother, Madam Hou, nearing 50, and his wife, Madam Qiu, 21, rented a room upstairs at the De Tai Inn, No. 277, Dalian Wan Road. Around 7 o'clock last night, due to trivial family matters, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had an argument, which escalated into a physical fight. Afterwards, Madam Hou ran to He's workplace to complain about everything. When He returned after finishing his duties, he scolded both of them severely. Afterwards, they were both filled with resentment. Around 9 o'clock, his wife, Madam Qiu, suddenly had the idea of suicide. She secretly bought a dose of "heavy smoke" and returned. Just as she was about to swallow it, she was spotted by her mother-in-law, who snatched it and shared it with her. Before long, they both developed symptoms of poisoning and vomited violently. After He noticed this, he immediately reported it to the Huishan Concession Police, who dispatched officers to rush to the scene. They sent them to the hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It is said that they had taken too much poison and their lives were in danger.</p>
<p>In the home of a certain Shanghai resident, a mother's helper named Cai, taking advantage of the opportunity to steal money, was arrested by the Cao Jia Du Public Security Bureau yesterday. It is said that a certain Shanghai resident had a trusted mother's helper, Cai, who had been hired for many years. Her employer's mother lived in the same room as the mother's helper. The mother's helper saw money in the drawer of the mother's room. Driven by greed, she stole the key and secretly stole the banknotes yesterday morning. At noon, while the owners were having lunch downstairs, the mother's helper set fire to the house, intending to deceive the owners. After starting the fire, she ran downstairs and shouted, "Fire!" The family members panicked. They reported to the Fire Brigade by telephone and sent a water cart to put out the fire, while also trying their best to extinguish the flames. As a result, bedding and other items were burned. When the items were checked, the banknotes in the drawer were missing. Because the mother's helper was highly suspicious, they searched her person and found the original stolen five hundred yuan and two silver dollars in the cotton padding of the mother's helper's cotton trousers. They immediately called the police, who took the mother's helper to the Cao Jia Du Public Security Bureau. The Bureau Chief, Tan Bao-shou, questioned her, and Cai confessed without hesitation. She also confessed that she had conspired with other maids to steal. The Bureau Chief immediately dispatched senior police officers to summon the introducer, Chen Jin-shi, 40 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 40, Yong Ting Lane; Shen Jin-shi, 35 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 17, Sanmin Lane; Miao Zhang-shi, 34 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 149, Lu Xue Residence; Zhang You-cai, 42 years old, from Sanyang, residing at No. 152 of the same address; and Feng Wang-shi, a maid from Nanjing, 35 years old, etc., to the bureau for questioning. However, Feng denied conspiring to steal. The bureau, in addition to ordering the owner to first take back the seized stolen goods, also detained the mother's helper and maids for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Attempt Suicide by Poison: Quarrel Leading to Violence, Both Lives in Danger</h3>
<h3>Public Concession Orchestra: Winter Performance Plan, Free Performance for Japanese Children</h3>
<p>Regarding the Public Concession's orchestra's winter performance program, it was previously decided that classical symphonic concerts and light popular concerts would be held alternately each week, in order to allow the general public to enjoy them widely. However, this regulation was of a trial nature. Now that the program has been running for some time and the results are very good, the Public Concession's Music Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that it continue until the end of winter. However, the previous two decisions to hold trial youth concerts, one on November 8th and the other on December 20th, both resulted in income shortfalls, failing to cover even the rental fee of the Lyceum Theatre. Therefore, the Music Committee decided to discontinue them. Furthermore, the Japanese residents of Hongkou had previously requested that the Public Concession Orchestra hold a concert for Japanese children at the North Sichuan Road Song and Dance Theatre. The results were good. Now, the owner of the theatre suggests that if a free concert can be held specifically for Japanese children, the theatre is willing to lend the venue without charging rent. The Music Committee has discussed this and believes that if there are no expenses for the Public Concession, the free concert for Japanese children can be held again. It is said that the Public Concession's Board of Directors has expressed its approval of the Music Committee's above-mentioned suggestions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamships: Abolishing Tip System for Stewards, Starting February 1st, Changing to Employment System, Salaries and Food Provided by the Company</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of legal tender by the Four Companies in the Ningbo route, the prices of hardware for ships have risen sharply, and coal prices have also skyrocketed. Yesterday, the price per ton even increased by 1.5 yuan. Therefore, starting from February 1st, the Shanghai-Ningbo steamships of the Four Companies will increase the original freight rate by 20%, regardless of whether the goods are coming or going. All customers and customs brokers have been notified. Furthermore, among the Four Companies, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiang Tian steamship has abolished the tip system for stewards and the charge for alcohol, changing to an employment system with monthly wages and food provided. The company will lose several thousand yuan per month, but passengers will be spared the extra cost of tickets and alcohol, which has been praised by everyone. Now, Taikoo, Sanbei, Ningshao, etc., are all following suit. Starting from February 1st, the price of round-trip tickets will be increased by 20% according to the fixed amount. This increase will be used to pay the wages and food costs of the stewards on board. At the same time, stewards will not be allowed to demand any tips from passengers. However, the monthly salary of the stewards is limited to 12 yuan and not more than 24 yuan. The Four Companies have all signed and implemented this agreement. The Shanghai-Ningbo steamships are able to completely abolish the old custom of tips, breaking decades of bad habits. This is largely due to the efforts of Liu Hongsheng. Passengers traveling back and forth each year can save a huge sum of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in extra tips. For example, if the ticket price is 3 yuan, the tip is also 3 yuan. Each steamship has 300,000 yuan in passenger fares per year, which means that passengers have an additional 300,000 yuan in alcohol charges. Now that this has been completely eliminated, it is truly a cause for celebration.</p>
<h3>Viennese Dancer's Home Robbed: Sister and Driver Responsible</h3>
<p>Liang Die-ying, a Cantonese dancer at the Vienna Dance Hall on Dahua Road, lives at No. 29, Lvyang Village, Lane 733, Kangnaot Road, West Shanghai. In addition to her mother, Liang Xu-shi, her sister, Yue-qin (15 years old), and a driver from Tongzhou, Qian Shan-chang, also live there. All of Liang's valuable jewelry and silver dollars were kept in a small silver box. The day before yesterday afternoon, Liang needed to withdraw some money and opened the silver box. She immediately discovered that 1,600 yuan in cash and 1,200 yuan worth of jewelry were missing. She immediately reported it to the Gordon Road Police, and Detective Zhu Meng-qi went to investigate. Yue-qin had already fled. At the time, it was suspected that Qian Shan-chang was a major suspect. He was taken to the police station, and a portion of the stolen goods, 499 silver dollars, was found on him. According to Qian's confession, the cash and jewelry were stolen by Yue-qin, who stole Liang's key and opened the silver box. She gave him 500 yuan and planned to flee to Nanjing at noon the day before yesterday. The detectives went to the railway station to arrest Yue-qin, but were unable to find her. Yesterday morning, Qian was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Jiang Bao-lian, explained the situation and filed charges against him for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. Because Yue-qin still needs to be apprehended, he requested permission to postpone the trial. Liang Die-ying also submitted a petition. When questioned, Qian Shan-chang confessed that Yue-qin stole the money and gave him 500 yuan. Judge Yang Qian-chang verified the confession and ordered Qian to be remanded in custody. The trial was postponed for one week.</p>
<p>Taikoo Company, a British company, suspended the operation of the Ningbo-bound New Beijing steamship and replaced it with the Tongzhou steamship. The stewards on the ship had a major dispute. There were more than 150 stewards on the New Beijing steamship and more than 30 on the Tongzhou steamship. The company only allowed 50 stewards to remain on the New Beijing steamship and 15 on the Tongzhou steamship, and dismissed the rest. However, the stewards did not agree. Yesterday, when the Tongzhou steamship was diverted, the stewards from both ships rushed to board the ship. The company reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who dispatched a large number of detectives to board the ship to persuade them, but the matter was not resolved. They were then driven ashore. The matter is still under dispute.</p>
<h3>Meifeng Bank Case: Continued Hearing the Day Before Yesterday, Second Defendant Brown's Testimony Inconsistent</h3>
<p>At nine o'clock on the 28th, the Meifeng Bank case continued to be heard in the American court. American Judge Hackley and Assistant Prosecutor Watson, formerly Dr. Silote, the prosecutor, both appeared in court in person. Tianjin lawyer Evans represented the first defendant, Mr. Raven, the general manager of Meifeng Bank. Lawyers Franklin and Watson represented the second defendant, Mr. Brown, the deputy general manager of Meifeng Bank. The prosecutor charged the first and second defendants with 16 counts of embezzlement and fraud. Dr. Silote rigorously interrogated the second defendant, Mr. Brown, asking in detail about the trading of American stocks and the gradual withdrawal of huge amounts of margin from the American brokerage firm. This took several hours to complete. The American court continued to open at nine o'clock yesterday morning to examine the second defendant. The prosecutor stated that Mr. Brown's testimony was obviously intentionally false. Therefore, he refuted and questioned each section of the inconsistent testimony in detail yesterday morning. The most detailed questioning was still about the purchase and sale of American securities on behalf of customers. The prosecutor still believed that Brown's testimony was intentionally avoiding the key points. Finally, it was planned to examine the first defendant, Raven. An American doctor, Dr. Deng, testified that Raven was in poor health. The judge scheduled the hearing to continue this morning.</p>
<h3>Chinese and American Consortia: Plan to Jointly Establish Chinese Rayon Factory, American Side Has Started Planning, But Requires Assistance from Our Government</h3>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency reports that our country's domestic silk has always been a world-renowned commodity, with huge annual sales abroad. Since the invention of rayon in Europe and the West through scientific methods, our country's natural silk has suffered a major blow. Because rayon is cheaper than real silk and its color is brighter than natural silk, silk manufacturers have adopted rayon in order to reduce costs and make it easier to sell their products. As a result, foreign rayon has been dumped in the Chinese market, and domestic raw silk has lost its vitality. Although our government has repeatedly increased tariffs to show its restrictions, due to the huge profits involved, foreign rayon continues to be smuggled into the country in a constant stream and in large quantities. Last spring, the industrial authorities had a plan to establish a rayon factory themselves, but it was not realized due to the huge investment and lack of funding. Last winter, the American Far East Economic Survey Group came to China and also believed that rayon was a permanent market for China. They once planned with powerful Chinese consortia to jointly invest in the establishment of a large-scale rayon factory in China. After the survey group returned to the United States, they prepared a detailed report to study the specific methods of establishing a Chinese rayon factory. However, they also put forward important opinions, requiring the Chinese customs to strictly crack down on the smuggling of rayon imports in order to benefit the factory plan. It is said that powerful consortia on both the Chinese and American sides are working hard to promote the realization of this plan.</p>
<h3>City Public Security Bureau Explains: Measures for Smokers to Exchange Permits While Traveling, Register at the City or County of Arrival to Cancel the Original Permit, Exchange a Temporary Travel Permit for a Travel Certificate</h3>
<p>The City Public Security Bureau reports that few smokers obtained travel permits as a result of the smoker registration last year. Because the people have many misunderstandings about the measures for smokers to exchange permits while traveling, some citizens have recently submitted a request to the bureau to explain these measures. Therefore, the bureau has issued the following detailed measures for exchanging permits while traveling:</p>
<p>Measures for Exchanging Permits: All items stipulated in Article 5 of the Measures for the Registration of Smokers Within a Limited Time refer to those who hold poor people's tobacco cessation licenses. Poor people traveling with their licenses can apply to the tobacco control authorities in the city or county of arrival to have a seal affixed to the original license for continued use. It is not necessary to obtain another travel permit. However, those who hold ordinary limited-time tobacco cessation licenses should, if they move to an area outside the jurisdiction of this city or county, follow the provisions of Article 8 of the Regulations on Enforcing Tobacco Cessation and Banning Smokers, holding their original license to register with the city or county of arrival, and request the city or county of origin to cancel the original license. If they are traveling temporarily, they may exchange the original license for a travel permit. This travel permit has been prepared by the Tobacco Control Supervisory Office and issued to the bureau for use.</p>
<p>Regulations on Registration: Attached are Article 8 of the Regulations on Enforcing Tobacco Cessation and Banning Smokers and Item 5 (D) of the Measures for the Registration of Smokers Within a Limited Time: Article 8 of the Regulations on Enforcing Tobacco Cessation and Banning Smokers: Those who have obtained a limited-time tobacco cessation license should, if they move or travel outside the jurisdiction of this city or county, hold their original license to the city or county of arrival and request the original county or city to cancel it. However, those who are traveling temporarily may exchange the original license for a travel permit. Item 5 (D) of the Measures for the Registration of Smokers Within a Limited Time: If the licensee moves or travels outside the jurisdiction of the city or county in Article 5, they may hold their original license to the competent authority of the city or county of arrival to apply for a seal to be affixed for continued use, without having to exchange it for a travel permit, as a gesture of consideration. Those who have exceeded the six-month time limit of this license should re-pay the fee to exchange the license and must submit the old license to the exchange agency to be sent back to the original issuing agency for cancellation.</p>
<h3>The Three Bureaus of Society, Public Security, and Health Negotiate: Measures to Ban Live Plucking of Pig Bristles, Issue a Circular to Relevant Organizations to Comply and Implement on Schedule, The Pig Trade Association Will Hold a Meeting Today to Rectify Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Pig Industry Association has suspended weighing for three days starting on the 28th to discuss and rectify business. It is said that the association has drafted measures to rectify business, which will be submitted to the full industry meeting for approval today before implementation. Regarding the ban on live plucking of pig bristles, the three bureaus of society, public security, and health have jointly negotiated measures. After reporting to the municipal government for the record, an announcement will be issued. The Bureau of Society will issue orders to the Fresh Pig Industry Labor Union, the Fresh Pig Retail Industry Association, the Fresh Pig Industry Association, the Fresh Pig Slaughter Industry Association, the Fresh Meat Industry Association, and other organizations to comply. The announcement of the Fresh Pig Industry Association and the original text of the instructions of the Bureau of Society are recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement from the Pig Trade Association: Respected Sirs, our association has previously resolved through a temporary emergency meeting of industry representatives to suspend weighing for three days starting on the 28th of this month, in order to discuss measures to rectify business. The Business Management Committee has resolved through a series of meetings to draft a business rectification plan, which includes (A) a draft outline of business rectification and (B) a draft of business rectification measures, as the guidelines for the industry's future business rectification. It should be submitted to the full industry meeting for approval and then announced for implementation. It is specifically scheduled to hold a meeting of all industry representatives at our association on the morning of the 30th of this month at 9:00 AM. It is hoped that your precious firm will send two fully authorized representatives to attend the meeting on time and work together to promote progress. Sincerely, The Shanghai Fresh Pig Industry Association, January 29, 1936.</p>
<p>Order from the Bureau of Society: It has been found that there have been incidents of live plucking of pig bristles on imported pigs in the city. This not only hinders inspection, but also abuses livestock and often leads to disputes. Although repeated announcements have been made to strictly prohibit it, it is still being neglected. Therefore, our bureau has negotiated with the two bureaus of public security and health on January 21 of this year to determine the following effective measures: Starting on February 20 of this year, pig bristles must be cut off before pigs are imported, in order to prevent the cruel act of live plucking for profit. In the future, any incidents of live plucking of pig bristles should be treated as animal cruelty and severely punished in accordance with Article 7 of the city's Slaughter Inspection Regulations. The Public Security Bureau should order its subordinates to comply, strictly enforce the regulations, and report to the Municipal Government for record-keeping, public announcement, and notification to the governments of the counties of origin of the pigs to notify pig vendors to comply. This order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Silver Transportation on Two Railways: Fees Changed to be Charged According to Passenger Transport Regulations</h3>
<p>The transportation of silver on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was originally contracted by the Dafeng Company. After the company ceased operations, the owners were temporarily responsible, with the owners sending people to purchase tickets and escort the silver. The freight was still calculated according to the rate set when the Dafeng Company was contracted. This rate was compared with the freight rates stipulated in the passenger car transportation regulations. The freight rate on this route was lower for short distances and higher for long distances, each with its own advantages. Now, in order to be consistent with all routes, the management bureaus of the two railways have decided to cancel the previously set separate freight rate from February 1 and change it to be charged according to the freight rates stipulated in the passenger car transportation regulations. The loading and unloading fees will be charged according to the loading and unloading package regulations.</p>

<h3>City Social Affairs Bureau: Actively Preparing for Temple Registration, Divided into Three Categories: Population, Property, and Ritual Objects, Starting from Late Next Month Until the End of June</h3>
<p>Regarding temple registration in this city, due to the Ministry of Interior's promulgation of regulations on the 4th of this month, after these regulations are implemented, all provinces and cities should conduct a new general registration of all temples within their jurisdiction, with the deadline for completing the initial temple registration set for the end of June this year. After receiving the order, the Bureau is now actively preparing for the implementation. According to the person in charge speaking to reporters, registration should begin in late next month (February). The most important aspects of the temple registration regulations are: (1) All publicly built, funded by donations, or privately built altars, temples, monasteries, and Taoist abbeys where monks and Taoists reside, should be registered in accordance with these regulations, in addition to complying with laws regarding household registration and real estate registration. (2) Temple registration should be applied for by the abbot. If there is no abbot, the application should be made by the manager. (3) Temple registration includes the following three items: Population registration, Property registration, Ritual object registration. Population registration is limited to monks and Taoists, but other residents should be reported incidentally (the aforementioned monks and Taoists refer to monks, nuns, Taoist priests, and female Taoist priests). Property registration includes religiously, historically, or artistically significant idols, statues, ritual implements, musical instruments, sacred objects, scriptures, sculptures, paintings, and all other antiques that should be preserved. (4) If a temple fails to register after notification or a newly established temple fails to apply for registration, registration should be enforced. Without special reasons, the abbot or manager may be replaced. If false information is reported or there is intentional concealment, upon discovery, in addition to enforcing supplementary registration, the abbot or manager may be replaced. If the circumstances are serious and violate criminal law, the case will be sent to the court for prosecution.</p>

The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<h3>Qin Weiye Escapes Kidnapping, Five Kidnappers Interrogated Yesterday, Those Found Unrelated Have Been Released, Qin Himself Has Gone to Ningbo and Not Returned, Initiated by Yan Jinhai</h3>
<p>Qin Weiye, the managing director of Tongyuan Bank on Tianjin Road (erroneously reported as Tongyuan in previous reports), was in his private car, number 2200, on the morning of the 15th of this month, with chauffeur Wu Asheng driving. Just as he boarded the car at the entrance of the Lianzhuli alley on Avenue Edward VII where he resided, several kidnappers swarmed into the car, each brandishing a handgun, intimidating Qin and Wu, ordering them to be silent, and forcing Wu to drive the car. Wu, being quite alert, drove along Chengdu Road and saw a trolleybus approaching. Wu deliberately collided with it, bringing both the car and the trolleybus to a screeching halt. Realizing the unfavorable situation, the kidnappers successively got out of the car and fled. Afterwards, Qin reported the incident, and the Jing'an Temple police apprehended eight male and female suspects, including Li Yizhi, involved in the case, and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered them to be detained for further investigation, as reported previously. In recent days, after investigation by Chinese and Western detectives handling the case, except for two men and one woman who were found to be unrelated and had been released with the court's approval, the remaining five men from Jiangbei, Li Yizhi (aka Da Zai), Wang Shaoqing (aka Ding Kezhen), Chen Yaonian (aka Chen Shaoqing), Zhang Er, and Zhao Qinghong, were brought to court again yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Lawyer Zhang first described the circumstances of the kidnapping as confessed by the defendants at the police station, stating that Qin Weiye lived at number 30 Lianzhuli and was about to go to Tongyuan Bank to handle business at 11:00 AM on January 15th, with his chauffeur Wu Asheng. Just as they were leaving Lianzhuli, three kidnappers suddenly got into the car with Qin and sat next to him, showing their handguns and ordering him to be silent. Another kidnapper got into the car and sat next to Wu, also forcing Wu to drive the car with a gun. This kidnapper, because he could drive, originally intended to drive Wu away and replace him, but before he could do so, Wu had already crashed the car into a trolleybus, stopping it. This kidnapper got out of the car and was still thinking of removing the obstacle to continue driving when Wu also took the opportunity to get out of the car and shouted "Kidnapping!" Thereupon, the two kidnappers sitting next to Qin, fearing that people in the trolleybus would notice, got out of the car one after another and fled. Only then was Qin safe and sound. Now Wu has been brought to the case and can prove the situation at that time, but Qin has gone to Ningbo and has not returned. Next, Wu Asheng testified about the situation of encountering the kidnappers that day. Questioned the defendants Li Yizhi and others, confessed that this matter was initiated by Yan Jinhai, and the handguns and ammunition were all issued by Yan, etc. Zhao also hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend him. Judge Liu then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Excrement Thrown on Bai Yushuang, Investigation Reveals Jealousy Among Competitors as the Mastermind, Another Accomplice Apprehended</h3>
<p>Bai Yushuang, a female performer of Bengbeng opera from Tianjin, also known as Li Guiqin, walked out of the alleyway of her residence at number 7 Sanxingfang, Beile Road, at 9:00 PM on the 27th. While hailing a rickshaw, intending to go to the Empire Theater to perform in the Yanyajing drama, she was suddenly attacked by an unknown young man from the same hometown, Zhao Yuqing, who threw a package of feces wrapped in oiled paper on her head. As a result, Bai's face and the gray overcoat she was wearing were completely stained with golden excrement. She shouted loudly, and the detective apprehended Zhao, who was handed over to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The circumstances have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Reason The supervising officer Jiang Futian and detective Liu Jinrong handling the case, after rigorous investigation, yesterday accompanied detectives from the Ximen Public Security Bureau to number 15 Xinshunli, Dapulu, to apprehend Zhao Yuqing's accomplice, Zhao Yurui (35 years old, Zhao's brother). According to his confession, Bai was envied by her competitors, who instigated the throwing of feces, etc. Zhao Yurui is now being held in custody and will be handed over to the court for questioning today. On the other hand, the detectives handling the case are investigating the mastermind to bring him to justice according to the law. Details will be recorded and reported later after further inquiries.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the "January 28th" Commemorative Meeting Pay Homage to Xiao De's Tomb</h3>
<p>Also Sent a Letter of Condolence to Xiao's Mother, and Visited the Tomb of Martyr Huang Yuquan</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, representatives from all walks of life in the "January 28th" Fourth Anniversary Commemorative Meeting paid public tribute to the tomb of Martyr Xiao De yesterday and also visited the tomb of Martyr Huang Yuquan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Floral Offering Ceremony</p>
<p>Tao Xingzhi, Yan Esheng, Li Gongpu, and Ms. Zhang Manyun, the four representatives from the Memorial Meeting the day before who were selected to commemorate American Flying Colonel Xiao De, prepared wreaths yesterday at 12:00 noon and went to the Hongqiao Airport, where they were accompanied by station chief Qin Xijun to pay public tribute in front of Martyr Xiao De's tomb. The order was as follows: 1. Representatives take their places; 2. Pay the highest respect to Martyr Xiao De, bowing once, bowing again, and bowing a third time; 3. Offer flowers; 4. Read the eulogy; 5. Observe silence; 6. The ceremony is completed, representatives withdraw.</p>
<p>Letter of Condolence to Xiao's Mother</p>
<p>At the same time, the four representatives also sent a letter of condolence to Xiao De's mother, expressing their condolences. A reporter from the New Sound Society translated the original text, which reads: "Dear Mrs. Xiao De, on the second day of the Fourth Anniversary of the January 28th Incident, we, representing the people of all walks of life in Shanghai, pay tribute to the tomb of your beloved son, Colonel Xiao. Colonel Xiao's heroic sacrifice inspired the enthusiasm of the entire Chinese people. Other pilots are using this tool to harm weak nations, while Colonel Xiao sacrificed himself for justice, establishing a supreme model for pilots. Now the Chinese people are rising up in unison. We firmly believe that freedom and equality will be achieved through the united efforts of the people. We respectfully extend our best wishes to the mother of Colonel Xiao, who sacrificed himself for justice, and wish a new world that truly seeks the happiness of mankind a long life."</p>
<p>Visiting Huang Yuquan's Tomb</p>
<p>At the same time, according to station chief Qin Xijun of the flight station, in addition to the American Xiao De's sacrifice in the January 28th Incident, there were also Zhao Puming and Huang Yuquan who died for the country in the Chinese aviation field. Martyr Zhao died in Hangzhou, and the Puming Flight Field has been established in Hangzhou as a memorial. Martyr Huang died in Shanghai and was buried in Hongqiao Airport. In addition, Shi Bangfan was injured and lost an arm in flight at the same time as Zhao Puming, and is now in Nanjing. The four representatives for the memorial service believed that Martyr Huang's sacrifice for the country was commendable in his loyalty and bravery, and since he was close at hand, even though they were not on a mission from the General Assembly, they should pay their respects. After paying respects to Xiao, they asked Station Chief Qin to lead them to Martyr Huang's tomb to pay their respects and offer sacrifices. The ceremony concluded at one o'clock, and they returned.</p>
<h3>Salt Affairs Department Denies Tax Increase on Sulfuric and Nitric Acids</h3>
<p>The opposition of Shanghai's chemical industry groups to the taxation of sulfuric and nitric acids was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to a spokesperson from the Salt Affairs Department to a reporter from the New Sound Society, the Ministry of Finance used to collect a surplus of one yuan per box for sulfuric and nitric acids. The new measures promulgated by the Ministry have cancelled the surplus and are actually a tax reduction. How can there be talk of a heavier tax? Furthermore, the new measures pay special attention to promoting national goods and protecting domestic products, and strictly crack down on foreign goods. These measures should be welcomed by all those who love to use national goods, such as the Kaicheng Tianli National Acid Manufacturing Factory and other related parties. Now, the city's Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and Enamel Association have telegraphed the Ministry, using the excuse of hindering the sale of national goods, which is very incomprehensible. Perhaps they are attempting to continue the old system of collecting a surplus of one yuan per box for sulfuric and nitric acids at the sales office, but failing that, they are changing direction and fabricating talk of a heavier tax.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster Situation in Fuyang, Report from the China Inland Mission Received by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road has already allocated more than 300,000 yuan for the relief of the Yangtze and Yellow River floods. It has been struggling to continue its efforts, so in the face of the drought in northern Anhui, apart from providing a limited amount of relief to Huoqiu, it fears to fully appeal on behalf of the victims in other areas to seek assistance from all walks of life. Now, it has also received a joint letter from Pastor Xing Yizhen and Li Fusheng of the China Inland Mission in Sanhejian Linshuiji, Fuyang County, strongly begging for relief in those two places. The tragic situation is unbearable to read. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully requesting, last year's drought was severe and the suffering was extreme. The area around Sanhejian Linshuiji was particularly severe, with more than 23,000 famine victims. At the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, because they could not afford to buy wheat seeds, many changed to planting rapeseed to get through the famine. Unexpectedly, as soon as the rapeseed emerged from the ground, men and women formed groups and gangs and dug them up empty, turning the land into a barren wasteland. How can the starving people survive? The tragic situation of Dou'er helping girls, etc., is difficult to describe in writing. Those who talk about it are heartbroken, and those who hear about it are terrified. If we do not quickly devise a plan for disaster relief, we will see the starving die on the roads and bones scattered in the fields, which is truly unbearable to witness. We should appeal to the famine victims as much as possible, so we send this special letter. Moreover, the river embankment from Linshui to Sanhejian is a key point for the water sources of the Shanhe River, the Shi River, etc. The embankment was severely breached by a flood twenty years ago. The construction in the twenty-first year was not completed and is still stalled to this day. Moreover, within the river embankment surrounding Sanhejian, there are 300 acres of fertile land, and the East Town of Sanhe is also located within it. The river embankment was also breached in that year. In the twenty-first year, only the breaches were filled. The investigation revealed that the construction of the two river embankments requires 20,000 yuan, more than 2,000 workers, and two months. If funds are allocated to provide relief by hiring laborers, the embankment surrounding the two places will be completed, which would be immeasurable and the memory would last forever. If you do not grant relief by hiring laborers, please allocate funds to rescue them. Life and death are at stake, and the lives of the people are at stake. Please approve.</p>

<h3>Flower Club Case Published, Female Hooligan Appeals</h3>
<p>Lu Laoqi, also known as Wenying, a 35-year-old famous female hooligan and Flower Club King from Nanxiang, was previously wanted by the French police with a warrant issued by the Second Court for participating in opening a large Flower Club and suspicion of inciting the assassination of horseman A Liu Shao Wenbin, who died. She was not apprehended for two years. It was not until 9:00 PM on December 5th last year that the French police inspector Qian Chenglong and others apprehended Lu at No. 5 Yurenli, Yunnan Road, and handed her over to the Second Special Court. The police department investigated the case of inciting the assassination, but due to the lack of evidence, she was not prosecuted and was only prosecuted for gambling. After Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly held court sessions, he sentenced Lu to two years of imprisonment on New Year's Eve last year for jointly intending to profit from gambling in a crowd, and fined her 1,500 yuan. If the fine is commuted to labor service, the total amount shall be converted in proportion to the number of days in six months. During the appeal period, she was ordered to pay a surety of 6,000 yuan for her appearance at any time. Later, Xie Tingxin, the owner of Yongfengtai South Goods Store at the intersection of Xinqiaojiekou, Caishi Street, was responsible and filed a statement guaranteeing her release. The details have been reported previously. It is now heard that Lu, dissatisfied with the original judgment, has filed a statement with the High Third Branch Court stating her reasons for appeal. The Second Special Court has compiled all the case files and submitted them to the High Third Branch Court for review. The date of the hearing is not far away.</p>

<h3>Bicycle Repair and Rental Industry Increases Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Repair and Rental Industry Association recently raised prices because the cost of vehicle raw materials has skyrocketed and business is sluggish, resulting in the closure of more than 100 businesses throughout the city. There are even more that are in a state of unsustainable maintenance. Therefore, a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was convened at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. Those who attended were Li Fengting, Wang Chongye, Yu Hongsheng, Xu Zhongliang, Liang Jingzhai, Cao Guojun, Zhu Hengli, Sun Hongchun, Han Baotai, Lin Maolang, Xu Lianjin, Li Xiaoshi, and more than ten others. Chairman Li Xiaoshi resolved that from January 24th, the prices for rental vehicles will be increased uniformly. The rental price for a large-size bicycle will be 2 jiao per hour, 1 jiao 5 fen for a medium-size bicycle, and 1 jiao for a small-size bicycle. If the time exceeds ten minutes, it will be counted as half an hour. If it exceeds half an hour, it will be counted as one hour to maintain costs. The resolution was unanimously passed and immediately notified to all colleagues in the industry for compliance. Those who violate or act contrary to the regulations will be reported to the competent authorities for severe punishment. In addition, the new certificates of the association have been printed. Colleagues can exchange their old certificates for new ones at the association during the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's New Pharmaceutical Industry (Continued) No. 11 of the General Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce Edited by the Chinese WeChat</h3>
<p>(2) Types of Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Merchants</p>
<p>Types of Pharmaceuticals—According to the commonly used classification method in the new pharmaceutical industry, the types of pharmaceuticals can be divided into the following six categories:</p>
<p>1. Raw Materials: These are further divided into industrial and medical types. Industrial raw materials include hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sodium thiosulfate, red lead, etc. Except for a small amount sold by pharmacies, most are handled by industrial raw material merchants such as Dafeng, Guotai, Guohua, Baoxing, and Zhenye. Medical raw materials such as antipyretic cakes, antipyrine, glycerol, and gray iodine must undergo formulation procedures before they can be used.</p>
<p>2. Prepared Medicines: These are finished products that can be taken after purchase, such as Panacea, aspirin, Zilaixue, and Paratol. These can be further divided into two types: one is imported from abroad, and the other is formulated by domestic pharmaceutical merchants themselves, but the raw materials used are mostly from abroad.</p>
<p>3. Injectables: Although they are a type of finished product, such as Fortiss and Promin, the administration of injectables must go through injection procedures and cannot be used by just anyone.</p>
<p>4. Machinery: There are numerous types of machinery, too many to list. Generally speaking, there are: venereal disease machinery, dental machinery, ophthalmological machinery, veterinary machinery, pediatric machinery, gynecological machinery, surgical machinery, etc.</p>
<p>5. Cosmetics: Since cosmetics have the medical function of turning ugliness into beauty, and their ingredients are mostly medical raw materials, although some of them have been taken by other industries, they are still an important business in the new pharmaceutical industry. For example, Yaschuan of the Continental Pharmacy, Star Flower Water of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, and Mianyou of the Haolai Company account for a very large position in the total turnover.</p>
<p>6. Sundries: Such as gauze, cotton, rubber, etc.</p>
<p>Types of Pharmaceutical Merchants—Pharmaceutical merchants in Shanghai, according to their business nature or business method, are distinguished by manufacturing, selling, dispensing, etc. There are fifteen manufacturers, such as Xinyi, etc. Their factory names, addresses, and main products are listed below:</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing, there are also eight that simultaneously engage in selling and dispensing, such as Wuzhou:</p>
<p>In addition, there are ten that engage in selling and dispensing, such as Huamei; nine that specialize in selling, such as Da Zhonghua; and two that specialize in dispensing, namely Xinjiji and Central. They are listed together below for reference:</p>
<p>Shen Bao National Goods Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Vegetable Oil Lamp</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yun Xun</p>
<p>Since Mr. Yang Yao of this publication once introduced the vegetable oil lamp, it has aroused the attention of people who are concerned about national goods. The author is also one of them. The ubiquity of oil lamps means that whether it is a bustling city or a remote village, they can be found everywhere. There is an idiom in our country: it is called "the seven things to start the day," and these seven things are "oil," "salt," "firewood," "rice," "sauce," "vinegar," and "tea." In fact, not every household is fortunate enough to enjoy rice. It is common to see people who have no worries about white rice and are well-fed. But no matter how bare the walls are, one flickering lamp is indispensable. Even if the lamp is as small as a bean, and the surroundings are dim, this lamp is still essential. Mr. Yang has repeatedly described the advantages and disadvantages of the need for lamps, the rise and fall of national goods, and blocking the leakage of national economic resources. Now there is no need to elaborate. Now that vegetable oil lamps have begun to be sold, I will tell readers what I have witnessed. This launch advertisement appeared on New Year's Day. I wrote down the location of the sales office and went there specifically for a look that day. Entering the Yifeng Enamel Factory sales office on Avenue Edward VII, I learned that although there were six or seven types of samples, only one style was officially for sale. On the left side of the cabinet was a lighted oil lamp for customers to see in person. I expressed satisfaction with the style and brightness. Now I have a few humble opinions that I should discuss with the original inventor. Although the selling price is only 38 cents, it still seems difficult to popularize, because the general kerosene lamps on the market are only about 20 cents, a difference of almost twice! I am afraid that not every poor rural family can buy one lamp. The wick should be smaller to save more oil. Instructions for cleaning the lampshade and adding lamp oil should include a simple diagram and text description. For example, the Yifeng sales office selling the lamp should set up two small dark rooms, with a vegetable oil lamp and a kerosene lamp lit in each room, so that customers can make a powerful and convincing judgment about the brightness. As for the sales staff, they should be selected from those with commercial training. Regardless of whether the transaction is successful, they should answer customer inquiries in detail. In short, this is a new national goods industry that requires sacrifice and popularization! To gain public trust and purchase is the highest principle! I have written down my observations. Readers can also refer to Mr. Yang Yao's visit report.</p>
<h3>Talking About Shaoxing Wine</h3>
<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>Speaking of the types of wine produced in our country, there are quite a few. To roughly count them, there are Shaoxing wine from Zhejiang, Yanghe sorghum liquor from Jiangsu, Fenjiu from Shanxi, Damei from Anhui, and Niuzhuang sorghum liquor from Liaoning, all of which are very famous. Because Shaoxing is the most famous wine-producing area in our country, its production volume is huge, and its sales are wide, no other type of wine can match it. Since Shaoxing wine occupies the first place among domestic wines, it is worth discussing, which is why this article was written.</p>
<p>Genuine Shaoxing wine is made with Jianhu water. Having been endowed with good water quality and having gone through more than a thousand years of manufacturing experience, its wine is thick in quality and mellow in taste. There is aged Shaoxing wine that has been stored for 20 or 30 years. Drinking it has a fragrant, clear, and profound charm that cannot be described in words. Generally, those who have a penchant for Li Bai, Chun Yuyi, and Liu Ling live their lives in wine every day. They can tell the difference between new and old, good and bad with a single sip. Moreover, the amount they can drink increases as they practice. They often drink four, five, or six catties at a time. In addition, wine is needed for weddings, funerals, entertaining guests, and worshiping gods. From this, the annual consumption of Shaoxing wine can be imagined.</p>
<p>In Shaoxing, there are a total of 1,800 large and small wineries. Each large winery produces thousands of vats of wine each year, while small wineries produce hundreds or dozens of vats. In total, the county produces more than 200,000 vats of wine each year, worth more than 40 million yuan. In addition to a portion being sold locally, most of it is shipped to Hangzhou and Shanghai, and then transshipped to the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Yellow River basins, as well as the three northeastern provinces. There are also exports overseas, such as to Singapore and various ports in India. Those sold locally are called "Benzhuang," and those sold to other ports are called "Luzhuang." Luzhuang wine accounts for about 50% of the total annual production. The tax revenue alone is about 9 million yuan per year. There are tens of millions of wine merchants who wholesale and retail, as well as skilled workers who rely on wine for their livelihoods. It cannot be said that it is not developed. However, because the wine-making methods are still the same as before, and the equipment used has not been improved, in recent years, foreign wine merchants have gradually taken away business, and the output has gradually decreased. If this continues, the Shaoxing wine industry will inevitably decline. Recently, I heard that a certain country is planning to set up a large-scale winery in the Northeast to resist the import of Shaoxing wine. If the Shaoxing wine industry does not catch up quickly, and research and improve manufacturing and sales methods in order to save itself, I am afraid that it will inevitably suffer the same failure as silk and tea in the future.</p>

<p>A Word of Advice</p>
<h3>The Minimum Extent of Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Government officials must strictly use national goods first. National goods factories and merchants must unanimously comply.</p>
<p>One day, many friends discussed ways to promote national goods. Everyone spoke very thoroughly and concisely. The proposals of Mr. Hu Xiyuan and Mr. Sun Daosheng were even more straightforward and were indeed the minimum conditions for promoting national goods. They said:</p>
<p>First, at a minimum, personnel serving in government agencies must strictly use national goods uniformly. Those who work for the government, eat government food, and use government money still do not use national goods. Who will use national goods then? If these people do not love the country, who will love the country?</p>
<p>Second, at a minimum, people working in national goods factories and national goods companies and stores must unanimously and strictly use national goods. Those who work in national goods factories and stores, eat national goods food, and use national goods money, yet do not use national goods themselves. Who will use national goods then? If you do not believe in national goods first, who will believe in national goods?</p>
<p>Huang Renzhi, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Huikang, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Xingyao, Xu Jianruo, and others present applauded and agreed that this was the most basic and minimum request. They hoped that there would be no more lofty talk or broad discussions. Everyone should do this first before discussing other things.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Issues a Circular Announcing the Purpose of Education During National Crisis: Only When All Schools Maintain Stability and Normalcy Can Great Results Be Expected</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th) The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all education departments and schools on the 29th, announcing the purpose of education during the national crisis. The original order states: "The country is in danger, and young people are depressed. Recently, students in various provinces and cities have made patriotic expressions in groups. Their motives have been understood by the government and society. However, some students in some schools have taken actions that have crossed the line, so that school discipline cannot be maintained, and national education is shaken. Recently, the principals of various schools who came to Nanjing, bearing the heavy responsibility, jointly issued a declaration. In addition to expressing their support for the integrity of national territorial sovereignty and doing their best to implement education that meets the needs of the national crisis, they also unanimously stated that they would sanction strikes and acts that damage discipline. Their words are earnest and thought-provoking. President Chiang attaches great importance to education and cares about the training of young people. His order on the 28th of this month provides detailed instructions on this kind of sanction. The Ministry is responsible for strictly following the order and doing its best to safeguard education without the slightest laxity. The life of education is the life of the nation. Once it is stopped or disrupted, there is no hope of national salvation. Therefore, destroying schools is definitely not patriotism. The principle is clear. In the future, education plans should be revised to adapt to the needs of the national crisis. The Ministry will carefully formulate them in accordance with the order. However, the implementation of this kind of plan must be carried out while schools at all levels maintain a stable and normal state in order to achieve great results. It is hoped that the principals and faculty of all schools in the country will uphold a firm and unyielding spirit, strictly abide by the order, implement school discipline, and ensure that school order is fully restored, so that there will be no more interruptions in classes. It is hoped that the youth of the country will channel their emotions into reason, put effort into practical work, and serve the country with perseverance. Do not be driven by temporary emotions, and do not be incited by a few who lack reason. We must know that the current national crisis is valued by the youth, and the future of the nation depends on the youth of today. It is urgent to hone our skills in time. In addition to strictly following the order and handling matters conscientiously, we hereby declare our thoughts in detail and earnestly. The order is hereby issued to all education departments and schools."</p>

<h3>The First Batch of Zhuyin Hanzi Typefaces Have Been Cast: Primary School Textbooks Are About to Change; Short-Term Free Education and Public Education Extracurricular Reading Materials Will Absolutely Adopt This Zhuyin Typeface</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to promote Zhuyin Hanzi, has now entrusted the China Bookstore in Shanghai to cast the 3,700 most commonly used characters and the 1,300 next most commonly used characters, for a total of about 5,000 characters, selected by Li Jinxi and others from the former National Language Unification Commission. After several months, the first batch of four No. 3 typefaces has been cast. Their scope of application is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  In official primary school Chinese language textbooks, only new characters in the text will use this typeface; non-new characters will not use it.</p>
<p>2.  Textbooks for all subjects other than official primary school Chinese language should uniformly use this typeface, because subjects such as arithmetic, social studies, and nature each have their main purpose, which is not to practice language. Therefore, all characters should have Zhuyin to avoid reducing the efficiency of teaching the subject due to language barriers.</p>
<p>3.  All extracurricular reading materials used in official primary schools, as well as all reading materials and textbooks used in short-term compulsory education and public education, must absolutely use this typeface to facilitate reading and increase knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Promotes Literacy Education for Silk Factory Workers: The Measures Have Been Approved by the Municipal Government and Have Been Implemented Since January</h3>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the "Shanghai Municipal Labor Literacy Education Implementation Measures," the literacy schools for workers in various industries in this city, which are handled by the Municipal Social Bureau, were originally based on factories, companies, and stores as units. However, the situation in the silk factory industry is special. Based on past experience, it is deeply understood that it is difficult to achieve good results without making changes. Therefore, the Bureau, together with the Literacy Education Committee, with the consent of the Silk Factory Industry Association, formulated the "Shanghai Municipal Silk Factory Industry Labor Literacy Education Measures" and submitted it to the Municipal Government for record. The original measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The establishment of silk factory labor literacy schools shall not be based on factories as units, but shall be established in districts based on the addresses of the workers, and shall be handled by the Literacy Education Committee. The expenses shall still be borne by the silk factories.</p>
<p>2.  All silk factories that start or continue to start work on or after January 1, 1936, shall bear a labor literacy education fee of 50 cents of national currency per machine, regardless of the length of the business period, and shall pay it in one lump sum, and only once.</p>
<p>3.  The silk factory labor literacy education fee shall be collected by the Silk Factory Industry Association, regardless of whether it is a member of the Wusi Factory Industry Association, and the Industry Association shall be responsible for all other accounting responsibilities. The monthly income and expenditure shall be reported to the Social Bureau by the Industry Association on a regular basis.</p>
<p>4.  If a silk factory has not paid the labor literacy education fee for more than two weeks after starting work, the Social Bureau may impose a punishment as appropriate.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to bearing the labor literacy education fee, the silk factory shall also bear the responsibility for investigating whether the workers are literate and assisting the silk factory labor school.</p>

<h3>Shenmei Middle School Decides to Close</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) The privately-run Shenmei Girls' Junior High School on Meibaige Road in this port has been operating for many years and has had good results in the past. In recent years, because the original founder has been unable to take care of it, the person in charge has failed to carry out the original plan. As a result, school affairs have gradually declined. The education authorities have made some accusations. There were not many elementary school students last semester, and the middle school departments at all levels were unable to form classes. The board of directors believes that such a situation is not in line with the purpose of promoting education and cultivating young people. Therefore, it recently submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to close the school. It is now learned that the Education Bureau will approve it.</p>

<h3>Making a First Appearance: The Chinese Basketball Team Defeats Mailing; Twenty Warriors Take Turns on the Court; the Ideal Lineup Has Already Begun to Emerge</h3>
<p>The North China, Nanjing, and Shanghai teams attending the national basketball preliminary round have already fought three times. The selection committee is currently carefully examining various skills and selecting formal personnel. Yesterday, the Mailing team was specially invited to play a trial match in Shenyuan for careful observation. The audience reached 800 or 900 people. The three teams took turns playing against Mailing. The strong and stubborn Mailing team had the strength to chase but no possibility of winning. The first half was 18 to 16. The result was 47 to 35. China won.</p>
<p>Reaching the Peak: The Chinese team gathered 20 basketball stars from all over the country to fight. Wang Yuzeng, San Hongbin, Mou Zuoyun, Li Shaotang, and Wang Nanzhen were the most ideal and elite and attacked the front line. After the jump ball, the agility of the passing and the agility of the shuttling were breathtaking and won thunderous applause. After Mou Zuoyun opened the record, the five players cooperated seamlessly. Wang Yuzeng gained the efforts of the entire army and scored six times in ten minutes. Looking back at Mailing, they could not make any progress. The score was 20 to 5, reaching the highest peak.</p>
<p>A Stalemate: Then, our army immediately sent Feng Zhihua, Yin Guiren, and Cai Yanxiong to the field. The situation of offense and defense was relatively relaxed. Boris and Steele gradually gained points, chasing to 13 to 22. Then Xu Heng was sent to replace Wang Yuzeng, and the situation remained unchanged, forming a stalemate. The scores increased. At the time of the timeout, China led with 28 to 16.</p>
<p>The Situation is Slightly Relaxed: After the lemon, the team was rearranged and fought again. The adjustment of the Chinese team was very similar to the previous half, but Mailing still sighed that they could not catch up. The forwards could not break through, relying only on guards Xue Fuqi and Mo Fei to score from long range. China then scored by Shen Yukong. Each side scored. In this segment, our army recorded four more goals than them.</p>
<p>The Final Performance: After that, China sent the third batch of fresh troops to fight. The offense and defense became more sluggish. As a result, Steele and Boris of Mailing frequently attacked, and storms were frequently seen as they added nine points in a row. The score was chased to 31 to 40. Dong Shu and Song, who were planning strategies on the sidelines, decided to send the first batch of troops back into battle. As soon as the soldiers entered the field, it was a natural success. Although Mailing struggled fiercely, the ratio was 7 to 5. When the bell rang, the battle ended, and China won with 47 to 35. It is scheduled to discuss the All-Shanghai Championship with the Pirates tomorrow. The scores of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Children's Education Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1) (6) (1)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Don't tell me you're not sorry?" Mr. Bhaer asked, greatly worried by his abnormality.</p>
<p>"I'm not sorry for anything."</p>
<p>"I forgave him before he asked," said Tommy, finding it harder to see brave Dan disgraced than timid Ned.</p>
<p>"Don't want to be forgiven either," answered Dan gruffly again.</p>
<p>"When you've been alone, and thought it over, perhaps you will. I don't want to tell you now how shocked and disappointed I am, but after a bit, I'll come to your room and have a quiet talk with you."</p>
<p>"It's no use," said Dan, he was about to continue in a defiant tone, but when he looked up and saw Mr. Bhaer's worried face, he hesitated; so, with just that one sentence as his farewell, he left the room, as if he felt he couldn't stay another moment.</p>
<h3>Korean Team's Poor Goalkeeping Leads to 4-5 Defeat Against North China Team; Korea Takes Early Lead with Three Goals in First Half; North China Turns the Tide in the Second Half</h3>
<p>The Korean Yonsei University football team, taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday, embarked on their annual long expedition. They initially faced the Hong Kong and Shanghai Westerners' League team, and their defeat was expected. However, in their second match yesterday against North China, they suffered a crushing 4-5 defeat. In the first half, Korea led comfortably with a 3-0 score. North China only managed to score through a penalty kick, breaking the duck. However, in the second half, Korea's actions became flustered, conceding four goals in a row, and North China overtook them with a 5-4 lead. Team leader Ma Dehan smiled broadly, expressing high hopes for this group of Hebei and Beijing athletes.</p>
<p>Kim Sung Scores a Hat-Trick: After the start of the match, North China attacked first. Hong Shengen fouled someone in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun Fulai took the shot, but despite his eagerness, he unfortunately missed the net. North China lost this good opportunity, and instead, Korea broke through their stronghold. Kim Sung excelled, showing both dribbling and shooting skills. From five or six yards from the goal, he kicked the ball into the net, opening the scoring. After the kickoff, Jiang Lu repeatedly launched attacks along the wing, but unfortunately, he couldn't connect with the center, resulting in no success. Center-back Tan Fuzhen dribbled the ball slightly slowly, and it was intercepted by Wei Huide, who passed it a few times, and then Kim Sung scored another goal. All the fans in the stands couldn't help but worry about North China. After that, Korea's attack remained strong, and North China's defense was in a precarious situation. Yang Chunying panicked and made a careless mistake, and Kim Sung kicked the ball into the net again, creating an absolute advantage of 3-0.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Pulls One Back: Seeing that their defenses were constantly being breached, all the North China players mobilized and launched a concerted counterattack. Jiang Lu and Sun Yongquan charged left and right, dribbling into the center. The Korean inner defense was anxious to save the ball, and committed another foul, resulting in a second penalty kick. The North China team, learning from the first missed penalty, took the matter seriously, and still let Sun Fulai take the shot. He hit the center of the net squarely, making the score 1-3. At this time, the five forwards were gradually able to coordinate, forming a cohesive force. Sun Fulai passed the ball from the center, but it was too high and didn't go in. Jiang Lu advanced along the wing again, dribbling the ball deep, but just as he was about to shoot, the goalkeeper snatched it away, only forcing a corner. Finally, Li Fenglou intercepted the ball and shot from a distance, but it was caught by the goalkeeper, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>Left and Right Wings Each Score a Goal: After the lemon, the teams changed sides and continued the battle. Korea launched a large-scale attack, leaving North China's defense empty, and Liu Xichun calmly kicked in a goal. At this time, the angry winger Jiang Lu directed the battle on the left. On the other side, Sun Yongquan happened to arrive, and when he got the ball, he shot and actually scored. Korea's counterattack was unsuccessful, and the ball was intercepted by Tan Fuzhen again, who carried it forward. Jiang Lan rushed to the enemy's goal, and used his left foot to hook the ball into the net, making the score 3-4, only one goal behind. The morale of the entire team was greatly boosted. Tan Fuzhen fought bravely, suffering a minor injury, but soon returned to the battle.</p>
<p>Little Jiang Lu Seals the Victory: Although the Korean forwards were waiting in front for a chance to attack, unfortunately, the center was not good at providing support, resulting in vain efforts. On the other hand, the North China players became more and more courageous as they fought. Sun Yongquan penetrated deep into the enemy's lines, dribbling past three defenders, and shot at the goal, creating a 4-4 tie. The fans were overjoyed. Recently, Jiang Lu again used his tactic of sneaking around, and seeing that the ball had reached his foot, he didn't wait for it to land, and hooked it into the net, making the score 5-4, reversing the defeat and sealing the victory. Soon after, the silver whistle sounded, and time ran out. After the game, the fans surrounded the team's car, eager to see the prowess of the young general Jiang Lu, which was not inferior to that of Li HuiTang (球怪). North China Team: Yang Chunying, Zhang Xueyao, Zhu Qingyu, Xu Feimin, Tan Fuzhen, Li Fenglou, Jiang Lu, Yan Chengkuan, Sun Fulai, Zhao Qichun, Sun Yongquan. Korea Team: Jin Zhongxuan, Zheng Longzhu, Hong Shengen, Tian Linxi (Sub), Han Jiabxi, Ding Haidun (Up), Jin Yanxi, Jin Cheng, Li Yu, Li Fenghao, Wei Huide, Liu Xichun.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses Weightlifting and National Martial Arts Regarding Attending the Olympic Preliminaries; Chu Decides to Accompany the Athletes on a Trip to Germany and Will Translate His Existing Sports Writings into German</h3>
<p>The World Games will be held in Berlin in August of this year, the eleventh session, and a number of athletes from our country will participate. A reporter visited Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee and director of the National Sports Association, yesterday to inquire about the details, and he made the following remarks. This time, Germany will hold the eleventh World Games in Berlin, and our country will participate on a large scale. In addition to 80 athletes, there will be another 20 inspection commissioners, totaling more than 100 people, which can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. The German government has given special preferential treatment, sending special ships to welcome our country's athletes, which is especially appreciated. This time we send athletes abroad to participate in various sports, and although winning the championship is not expected, it is a great opportunity to visit advanced countries, broaden our horizons, and learn from them. Of course, this participation will focus on ball sports and track and field, but our country's inherent national martial arts also have considerable value and should not be ignored. At last year's Shanghai Sixth National Games, the various performances of national martial arts were already valued, and it must be said that women's performances have progressed faster. Europeans and Americans do not yet fully understand Chinese martial arts, and their belief in Japanese judo is not as deep. The reason for this is that the Japanese have been able to use the strengths of Chinese boxing and make it scientific, and the Japanese have made the same effort to promote judo as they have with other promotions. We have been promoting national martial arts for seven or eight years, and although there are national martial arts halls in the central government and various provinces and cities, they only provide instruction and practice. There have been few so-called scientific martial arts inventions. Although I have not been able to devote all my energy to sports, I have been studying for a long time in my spare time and have gained some insights. I have used the strengths of national martial arts to invent Tai Chi exercises and various sports machines. This time, I very much want to go to Germany, and I have already translated my existing sports writings into English and French, and now I am translating them into German so that they can be distributed at that time. Regarding the selection of weightlifting and national martial arts performances, the board of directors of the National Sports Association has designated me and Zhang Zhijiang, Shen Siliang, and Ye Liang as the selectors, with me as the convener. Mr. Zhang is abroad, and only Mr. Shen and Mr. Ye can be consulted at present. Fortunately, the selection principles have already been decided by the conference. Weightlifting athletes are easier to select because the method is simple, as long as they can lift heavier weights. However, there are many categories of national martial arts, so it is necessary to be both broad and precise, and to have skills in both bare hands and weapons, in order to be selected. Because there are only six people, it is hoped that a small number of people can show a variety of wonderful national martial arts. The preliminary selection is scheduled for May 15th, and the re-selection will be held on May 21st. The association will send letters to the local education departments and martial arts organizations in advance, and each place will recommend two or three people to report to the Shanghai National Martial Arts Hall at that time. The round-trip travel expenses and accommodation fees will be borne by the recommending organization, and the expenses after the re-selection will be borne by the association. This notice will be issued soon so that each place can find athletes. Four weightlifting athletes will be selected, two from the mainland and two from the Nanyang Islands. There will be twelve people in the initial selection for national martial arts, and six in the re-selection. These six people will be formally sent out. It is hoped that all places will pay special attention to the selection when recommending athletes. We are looking for talents with good character, high martial arts skills, and youth, in order to win glory for the country.</p>
<h3>Soccer King and Others Did Not Appear; Small Soccer Match Caused a Dispute Yesterday; The Audience, Feeling Cheated, Demanded a Refund, Causing the Match to Be Suspended; Audience's Anger Subsided Slightly When Game Vouchers Were Used to Support Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The local small soccer association, taking advantage of the presence of soccer king Li Huitang in Shanghai, specially organized the Lianghua and Mixed teams, which once represented the city in the small soccer performances at the Sixth National Games, to meet at the Huxi small soccer field on Bailinan Road yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Soccer king Li and famous general Li Shoyou were invited to join Lianghua in the battle. Due to the awe of the soccer king's name, the stands on the left and right were packed. The soccer king arrived at the field at 4:05 p.m. amidst thunderous applause. Li Shoyou, Sun Jinshun, Wan Xianghua and others did not arrive due to other matters. After the soccer king performed the opening ceremony, he left the field, and some of the audience expressed their dissatisfaction with this matter and shouted for refunds, which was echoed by the entire field, causing great chaos. The security team and defense corps that were maintaining order at the field were unable to maintain it. Liu Chunshu and Zheng Liankun of the Huxi small soccer association were surrounded by the audience, and the stalemate had not been resolved as of 5 p.m. According to this match, the ticket prices were divided into two types: four cents and two cents (洋). Because there were no ticket stubs, there was no way to distinguish between them. A compromise solution was proposed: all the proceeds from yesterday's match tickets would be transferred to charitable organizations, and the receipts would be made public to show credibility. Although the audience suffered a slight loss, they could be forgiven for their difficulties because it would benefit disaster victims. However, as of the evening, most of the audience still did not sympathize and refused to leave.</p>

<h3>British Elementary School Physical Education Team Training Method (3)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The Responsibilities of the Team Leader</p>
<p>The team leader is not just a nominal leader, he should have proper responsibilities. Initially, he leads the entire team, such as when forming a team, he stands in front first and lines up, and then the entire team follows him to line up, or when doing other activities, he does it himself first, and then the entire team follows him. Later, the teacher can let the team leader order the entire team to line up and see if they are lined up in the normal place or lined up neatly. When doing team activities, the teacher should train the team leader to arrange for all the team members to have the opportunity to take turns in activities. When giving orders, the team leader should stand at a suitable distance from the entire team. When changing formations, the team leader leads the way in front, telling the entire team to follow him to form a new formation. These team leader duties should be established as early as possible. Any team leader who can do it first will receive praise from the teacher. The team leader should be responsible for taking out and returning various sports equipment. Later, he will also be responsible for placing these equipment appropriately and dividing the field. These tasks can be practiced well under the guidance of the teacher. If help is needed in the activity, the team leader should first help the team members, but each team member should also take turns helping others. When necessary, the team leader should also be responsible for recording the results of each team member, such as the long jump, etc., but this record can also be taken in turns by the team members themselves. The team leader should pay attention to whether all the team members can practice purposefully or take turns appropriately, so that they can maintain interest in the activity. He should also pay attention to whether the rules explained by the teacher are followed by the team members, such as taking a few steps before jumping, etc. Sometimes, the teacher can ask the team leader which team members have done the best, and then ask these people to come out and do it for the whole group, while the teacher criticizes them. This way, all the children can get correct performances and good results.</p>
<p>Utilizing the Competitive Spirit</p>
<p>The competitive spirit is the motivation to encourage effort, especially in physical education activities. Competition is a natural tendency for most children. Competition between teams is a good stimulus and a motive for each team to practice loyally in cooperation. However, the teacher should pay attention to excessive competition and competition on minor matters, which instead reduces interest. Also, do not force children to engage in competition between teams. The motivation for competition should ideally come from the needs of the children. There is now a type of competition that has not yet been adopted by most schools, which is that each individual tries to compete with his own past performance, trying to break his own past record. There is also a good competition method, which is to encourage all the members of the class and the team to compete together, trying to reach the highest standard for the whole class or the whole team. These forms of competition are all good training methods that can be used in team training. (The End)</p>

<p>Special Issue of the National Children's Reading Materials Exhibition</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Holding a Children's Reading Materials Exhibition</h3>
<p>Announcement by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>The committee believes that children's reading materials are the "spiritual food" of children and have a great impact on children's education. Therefore, during the implementation of this Children's Year, we have collected more than 2,000 kinds of children's reading materials from all over the country, totaling more than 10,000 volumes. From January 30th to February 5th of the 25th year, they will be publicly exhibited in the capital, and after the exhibition in the capital, they will be prepared to be transported and exhibited on a tour in various important places across the country. At the beginning of the conference, we will present the purpose of holding a children's reading materials exhibition, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To Provide the People of the Country with an Overview to Correct Their Views on Children's Reading Materials</p>
<p>The people of the country mostly ignore children's reading materials. Some think that they are insignificant and pay no attention to them, do not discuss them, and do not debate them. Others only see a part of them and feel that they are not in line with their own subjective views, and then loudly denounce them as absurd... These attitudes are enough to destroy the new seedlings of children's reading materials improvement and leave room to spare. This time, we will concentrate various children's reading materials in one place and publicly exhibit them, inviting the people of the country to take an overview. We believe that at least we can let the people of the country know that our country's children's reading materials actually have so many, which are almost also "massive works," occupying an important position in the publishing industry. These books have also taken the minds of many authors and the financial resources of many publishers... to compile and print, and are not accidental and boring. "Supply to meet demand" is a certain truth. Children need these books, so the publishing industry publishes these books. Why do children need such books, and not the old-fashioned "Three Character Classic" and "Sacred Scripture and Virtuous Biography?" There must also be "its own reason" in this. These books have greatly changed in appearance from the children's books of more than ten or twenty years ago. Why should they be changed? There must also be an important reason in this. These books naturally have good and bad, and can be taken or discarded. Before seeing only a part of them, not seeing the whole picture, and not studying them carefully, one cannot make rash judgments and write them off with one stroke.</p>
<p>(2) To Provide Experts with Research to Improve and Select Children's Reading Materials</p>
<p>Our country's children's reading materials have good and bad. If they are not studied and not criticized, then not only will authors and the publishing industry have no guidelines and not know how to improve, but also schools and families will have no guidelines and no way to select and discard. This time, we will concentrate children's reading materials in one place, and also use foreign children's reading materials as reference materials, and hire dozens of well-studied experts to organize a judging committee to study and judge them. We also hope that experts who have not been hired will also write out their good ideas as much as possible and send them to the judging committee or this committee for reference. We believe that the results of the research will definitely be a systematic and clear report compiled and printed, pointing out the general advantages and common shortcomings of children's reading materials, and contributing to the writing industry, the publishing industry, and schools and families, as standards for improving children's reading materials or selecting children's reading materials. Of course, the research results of the judging committee, etc., may not be the most accurate standards, but they will help improve and select children's reading materials, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>(3) To Provide a Reference for the Literary World, Hoping That New and Old Writers Will Devote More Effort to Compiling and Writing Children's Reading Materials</p>
<p>Most of our country's new and old writers do not pay attention to children's reading materials, and even disdain to compile and write children's reading materials, thinking that children's reading materials are "thin and small articles," and are "humble and unworthy of mention," and that they do not need to pay attention to them or make efforts. Therefore, the products show both flaws and perfections, and greater works cannot be produced. The new and old writers of the past have also occasionally translated or written one or two children's reading materials due to their interest, such as "Education of Love," "Tolstoy's Fairy Tales," "Little Slope's Birthday," etc., but because they were not compiled and written in "mass language" and "children's language," the writing is often difficult and few children can understand it. This time, we will concentrate various children's reading materials and excellent children's reading materials from various countries in one place, and invite new and old writers to pay more attention. We hope that everyone will learn from the importance of children's reading materials and from the trend of foreign writers studying children's literature (various countries have children's literature research associations, and the Soviet great writer Gorky is also studying and promoting children's literature. In 1934, the capital of the Czech Republic held an exhibition of children's literature works, and our country also selected excellent reading materials to send for display...), no longer despise children's reading materials, and urgently start studying and writing, producing more pure and great works, so as to greatly change the appearance of children's reading materials.</p>
<p>In addition, because of this exhibition, the publishing industry may also change its previous attitude due to its impressions, seek out more good books, and improve printing and binding, so that children's reading materials can be more perfect. Then, the committee's holding of this reading exhibition will be even more meaningful. The meeting has already opened, and we hope that the people of the country, experts, writers, and the publishing industry... will come to see it, pay more attention, and put more effort into it... in order to create fortune for children, which is fortunate indeed! (The End)</p>
<h3>The Preparations for the National Children's Reading Materials Exhibition</h3>

<p>The National Children's Year Implementation Committee held a National Children's Reading Materials Exhibition in accordance with Article 27 of the Implementation Measures Outline. The original opening period was in December of the 24th year, but later, because the reading materials collected from foreign countries and remote provinces and cities could not be sent on time, the opening was postponed to January 30th. The preparation for this meeting took from June of the 24th year to now, a full seven months. Now, the preparations are described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Collecting Reading Materials</p>
<p>Current elementary school textbooks and various other children's reading materials published by domestic bookstores were collected directly from the bookstores by the committee.</p>

<p>Children's reading materials self-compiled by domestic educational institutions and the results of research on children's reading materials were collected by the committee from local educational administrative agencies.</p>
<p>Excellent foreign children's reading materials were collected by the committee by requesting the Ministry of Education to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which ordered the embassies abroad to collect ten kinds each from the educational institutions in the host countries.</p>
<p>Bad children's reading materials popular in society were collected by the committee from small book stalls.</p>
<p>(2) The Organization and Work of the Preparatory Committee</p>

The committee was established on October 31st. For the convenience of handling affairs, the committee was divided into six sections: general affairs, collection and compilation, layout, communication, review, and discipline. The committee was responsible for the general affairs section and the collection and compilation section, the Social Bureau was responsible for the layout section and the discipline section, the Nanjing Municipal Children's Year Implementation Committee was responsible for the communication section, and the National Compilation and Translation Museum was responsible for the review section. Xue Tianhan, Qian Yonghe, and Yang Ruihong were elected as standing committee members and were responsible for presiding over the preparatory work. The committee has held six preparatory meetings in total during the preparation period of three months. All matters relating to the purpose of the exhibition, the location of the exhibition, the organization of the judging committee, the selection of judges, the classification of reading materials, the method of cataloging, the layout of the venue, the reception arrangements, and the method of printing special issues in newspapers were decided by the committee.</p>
<p>(3) The Organization of the Judging Committee</p>
<p>According to the decision of the second preparatory meeting, personnel with experience in elementary school education and research on children's reading materials were invited to serve as judges. A list of names was immediately drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Education to invite Liu Yingshi and 33 others to serve as judges and organize the Judging Committee, and Wang Weixin was elected as the convener. On November 29th, the first meeting was convened to decide that the committee would judge supplementary reading materials. The committee also divided all the judges into four groups according to the nature of the supplementary reading materials: literature and art, society, nature, and industry journals and periodicals. Wang Wanzhong was the convener of the literature and art group, Wang Weixin was the convener of the social group, Pan Pingzhi was the convener of the natural group, and Xue Tianhan was the convener of the series journal group. The committee has held three meetings so far, and the judging form, judging standards, and instructions on how to use the judging form have been formulated by the committee.</p>
<p>(4) Classification of Reading Materials</p>
<p>All the children's reading materials received are divided into four categories: textbooks, supplementary reading materials, reference books, and children's reading materials popular in society. The textbook category is divided into ten groups: civics, hygiene, physical education, national language, society, nature, arithmetic, handicraft, fine arts, and no music. The supplementary reading material category is divided into four groups: literature and art, society, nature, and industry journals and periodicals. The reference book category is divided into two groups: foreign reading materials and research on children's reading materials. The children's reading material category popular in society only includes bad reading materials belonging to the serial picture category and is no longer divided into groups.</p>
<p>(5) Estimated Number of Reading Materials</p>
<p>The reading materials we have collected this time, in terms of source, include eleven countries: England, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United States, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Soviet Russia, Poland, and Denmark. Domestic products include twenty provinces and cities: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Chahar, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Guangxi, Nanjing, Qingdao, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai. There are ten bookstores: Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Da Dong Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Children's Bookstore, New China Book Company, Popular Bookstore, Zhengzhong Bookstore, and Chunqiu Bookstore. In terms of quantity, there are 297 kinds of current elementary school textbooks in our country, totaling 1,935 volumes. There are 1,508 kinds of supplementary reading materials, totaling 5,630 volumes. There are 199 kinds of reference books in the research group, totaling 222 volumes, and 217 kinds of foreign reading materials, totaling 288 volumes. There are 229 kinds of children's reading materials popular in society, totaling 4,412 volumes. The total is 2,450 kinds, totaling 12,498 volumes. In addition, there are more than 100 kinds of outdated textbooks in our country, totaling 2,000 volumes, which are not included. All reading materials have been compiled into a detailed catalog, which can be printed after the meeting. (The End)</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Elementary School Textbooks in Our Country Since the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan Yin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Before the establishment of schools in the late Qing Dynasty, children's reading materials in our country were broadly divided into two categories. One category was for enlightenment, such as the "Three Character Classic," "Hundred Family Surnames," "Thousand Character Classic," "Poems of Child Prodigies," "Thousand Family Poems," "Everyday Use Character Book," "Diary Stories," and "Elementary Learning." The other category was for preparing for the imperial examinations, such as the "Four Books," "Five Classics," "Historical Mirror," and "Ancient Prose." Some of these reading materials lacked educational significance, while others contained overly profound ideas that did not suit children's lives. Moreover, the language was very difficult. During teaching, besides rote reading and memorization, children could not understand what they were reading. It took children seven or eight years to thoroughly memorize these books, and then the teacher would explain them, gradually allowing them to understand the meaning of the words and sentences. As for the great principles of sages, they often read them for a lifetime, until they died, without understanding anything. Of course, starting with these textbooks, one could continue reading and produce a few so-called "learned scholars." However, either success was only achieved by a small number of geniuses, or these few geniuses often became useless after mastering the books. Some of these useless individuals were pedantic, muddled, and unable to distinguish between good and bad, while others were reckless, unrestrained, and out of touch with human feelings... Compared to foreign geniuses who became inventors and scientists... it is truly pitiful and regrettable that they were not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. With the rise of schools, these reading materials should naturally gradually withdraw from the realm of children's education, and new elementary school textbooks should provide children with food for enhancing their intelligence.</p>
<p>The newly emerging elementary school textbooks have been constantly reformed and improved since the late Qing Dynasty. How exactly have they been reformed and improved? The best way to understand this is to compare and study the current elementary school textbooks with the former ones, and also compare and study them with the elementary school textbooks of various modern countries. Then, a detailed analysis and explanation should be provided. Currently, I do not have the time for detailed analysis and explanation, so I can only provide a general overview based on what I have seen. I believe that the most significant reforms and improvements in elementary school textbooks are roughly the following:</p>
<p>(I) The Rise of Vernacular Chinese</p>
<p>The elementary school textbooks from the late Qing Dynasty until 1917 were all in classical Chinese. Although the classical Chinese used in the latest textbooks published by the Commercial Press was more refined and concise than that in the enlightenment textbooks, it was still very difficult for children to understand. Therefore, following the Commercial Press, publishers released so-called concise textbooks with relatively reduced material and more accessible language. In 1912, the Zhonghua Book Company rose to prominence and published a set of New Zhonghua textbooks. However, the language in these textbooks was not concise. Although they were widely adopted by the elementary education community due to political reasons, they soon disappeared naturally. To adapt to the needs of the times, the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company each compiled textbooks with even less material and more accessible language, such as the Republican Textbook, the New System Textbook, the Practical Textbook, and the New Style Textbook, which were published one after another. However, no matter how simple classical Chinese was, children could not understand it directly. Elementary school teaching spent four-fifths of the effort on reading, which only produced a small number of barely literate high-achievers, which was far from the goal of national education. Around 1917, we realized that language is a tool, and classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese have similar functions. However, vernacular Chinese is written in spoken language, which is easier to understand when reading, without the need for translation and explanation. Writing is also easier, allowing one to write whatever one wants to say. Therefore, we advocated using vernacular Chinese to compile elementary school textbooks and compiled vernacular Chinese materials to teach children in the schools we ran. The first textbooks in the market to include one or two vernacular Chinese lessons were the New Style Textbooks published by Zhonghua Book Company, but the method was not thorough. After the May Fourth Movement, the tide of the Literary Revolution and the National Language Movement rose. The Ministry of Education in Beijing also vigorously promoted the national language. Therefore, the elementary school textbooks published after 1920, such as the New Method Textbooks by the Commercial Press and the New System Textbooks by Zhonghua Book Company, were all compiled in vernacular Chinese, and classical Chinese textbooks gradually became naturally eliminated. Now, classical Chinese textbooks are almost completely extinct. Even if there are one or two still being privately sold by bookstores or used by conservatives, their influence is ultimately weak. In the near future, they will inevitably be eliminated due to the inconvenience of teaching. The change from classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese in elementary school textbooks is a major progress and a natural trend in elementary school teaching. The Ministry of Education's advocacy only accelerated the process. Even if the Ministry of Education did not advocate it, this trend would have come naturally. Therefore, although some people still advocate using classical Chinese in elementary school textbooks or even forcibly using classical Chinese and reading classics, I think this is only a temporary phenomenon and will eventually disappear naturally. As a result of the change to vernacular Chinese in elementary school textbooks, the reading ability of elementary school children has indeed improved a lot. Children aged six or seven in the lower grades can even automatically read various supplementary reading materials. Although high school graduates have not studied classical Chinese, they can roughly read books and newspapers written in simple classical Chinese. It seems unreasonable that reading vernacular Chinese can achieve such results. In fact, the reason is very simple: the vernacular Chinese lessons read in the higher grades are very close to the journalistic style of classical Chinese in newspapers. Therefore, the result is that reading vernacular Chinese can also enable one to read classical Chinese books and newspapers. This is naturally a general statement. If someone refutes this by saying, "I used to study classical Chinese in elementary school, and as a result, I can read classical Chinese books and newspapers and write very good classical Chinese or vernacular Chinese essays. My son is now studying vernacular Chinese in elementary school, but he can not only not write essays, but also cannot read newspapers," that is a special situation of their father and son and cannot be generalized to the majority.</p>
<p>(II) The Rise of Children's Literature</p>
<p>Before 1921, some textbooks also contained stories such as fairy tales and fables, such as "The Snipe and the Clam Fight," "Yu Gong Moves the Mountain," "Mr. Yong's Rat," and "The Donkey of Guizhou," but the amount was very small. At that time, elementary school Chinese language included all kinds of common sense, and most of it was expository writing. High school textbooks contained even more expository writing. Expository writing is very dry and tasteless, and readers do not develop any interest in it. Therefore, when elementary schools used this type of textbook, children were generally uninterested. There was a phenomenon of "those who are willing to teach are ignored by those who are willing to listen." Experienced elementary school teachers know that this is not a good method. Therefore, they advocated giving children more interesting texts to read—especially in Chinese language. On the one hand, children should be forced to memorize character symbols and acquire the ability to use language. On the other hand, children should understand the content and acquire miscellaneous knowledge. This inevitably leads to "doing twice the work for half the result" and "putting in effort without getting good results." It is better to compile some light-hearted stories for children to read, so that children only find the stories interesting and unconsciously make an effort to read, and unknowingly become familiar with character symbols. Because of this advocacy, there were lessons such as "Coal Talks" and "The Autobiography of Water" in Chinese language textbooks in 1915 and 1916. These lessons used anthropomorphic dialogue or autobiographical form to describe the causes and functions of coal and charcoal, and the changes of water. This is what is called "children's literature," which is fundamentally different from expository writing. Around 1921, some people advocated children's literature. They believed that children love literature just as much and need literature. We should give children the literature that belongs to them. Therefore, the high tide of children's literature rose greatly. The elementary school Chinese language curriculum of the so-called New School System made "children's literature" the center. The Chinese language textbooks of various bookstores, such as the Commercial Press's New School System, Zhonghua's New Teaching Materials and New Education, and the World's New School System, also used children's literature as a selling point, adopting stories, fables, jokes, natural stories, life stories, legends, historical stories, children's songs, folk songs, and so on. Other textbooks, such as history and geography, also advocated incorporating the fun of children's literature, but this was not fully achieved. Of course, the so-called children's literature at that time was very immature. However, the content of the previous textbooks was too realistic and used abstract explanations and narrations, just like the common sense section in the Shen Bao supplement a few years ago, which few people wanted to read. The textbooks after 1921 adopted stories and poems that were closer to children's lives, like more interesting pictorials and movie publications, so naturally more people wanted to read them. The rise of children's literature in textbooks has not changed to this day. In recent years, although some people have opposed the so-called "animal language" and opposed the entire children's literature ("animal language" cannot represent the entire children's literature) and wished to expel children's literature from elementary school textbooks, according to the results of the Ministry of Education's research on issues sent to the elementary education community in various provinces and cities last year, the elementary education community across the country still unanimously advocated that the Chinese language curriculum should make children's literature the center. When we look around at the elementary school textbooks in Europe and the United States, almost all of them have already been "children's literatureized." The elementary school textbooks in the United States are even more so. The Soviet literary world has also been vigorously promoting children's literature and creating children's literature recently. It can be seen that children's literature will never separate from elementary school textbooks. Even if they are sometimes forced to separate, it is only a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>(III) The Educational Purpose is Gradually Correct</p>
<p>The earliest elementary school textbooks focused on materials such as self-cultivation, loyalty to the emperor, and patriotism. After the Republic of China, materials that were loyal to the emperor and violated the principles of the Republic of China were removed, and free thought regarding democratic politics was added. In 1915 and 1916, because Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor, various bookstores also published so-called practical textbooks, avoiding words such as the Republic of China. Because of the end of World War I and the terror of repeated civil wars among domestic warlords, peace was advocated both domestically and internationally. The elementary school textbooks in our country after 1921, such as the New School System, New Education, and New Teaching Materials, almost became universal reading materials without purpose or aim, lacking the expression of national spirit and national thought. This was indeed the biggest shortcoming of the textbooks at that time. After 1927, the atmosphere of revolution permeated the country. Elementary school textbooks, such as the Commercial Press's New Era, Zhonghua's New Zhonghua, and the World's New Doctrine, were filled with many teaching materials on the National Revolution and the Three Principles of the People. However, the language of the textbooks at that time was very sloppy, and the content inevitably contained too many slogan-like shouts. The textbooks after 1931, such as the World's New Standard, the Kaiming's Kaiming, the Commercial Press's Revival, Zhonghua's New Elementary School, and the Datong's New Life Talk, had lower shouting momentum, and the purpose gradually became correct. The textbooks of each subject can generally be compiled in accordance with the curriculum standards set by the Ministry. Chinese language textbooks can also make the national spirit the backbone, especially focusing on teaching materials such as saving the country and wiping out shame, and mixing them with invention stories, science stories, and reading method guidance. The outside world does not understand the truth and has two extremely contradictory and ridiculous views on the current elementary school textbooks. On the one hand, some celebrities and dignitaries believe that elementary school textbooks are just some "animal language" and do not have national thought and cannot cultivate the country's national consciousness. On the other hand, the Japanese believe that the national thought is too strong, considering it to be "anti-Japanese education," forcing the Chinese government to demand revisions to elementary school textbooks. In fact, although some of our country's elementary school textbooks have some "animal language" and national thought, they do not conflict. For example, "Sheep Resist Dog" and "Dog Resist Wolf" implicitly contain the consciousness of the weak resisting the strong. As for the clearly stated teaching materials on national thought, such as "Li Mu Repels the Huns," "Su Wu Herds Sheep," "Ban Chao Pacifies the Western Regions," "Battle of Feishui," "Yue Fei Repels the Jin," "Yu Yunwen Repels the Enemy at Caishiji," "Yuan Chonghuan Repels the Manchus," and "Qi Jiguang Pacifies the Pirates"... there are truly countless such lessons in elementary school textbooks. National humiliation teaching materials, such as "The First Opium War," "The Sino-French War," "The Sino-Japanese War"... "May Third," "May Ninth," "September Eighteenth," and "January Twenty-Eighth" are all included. I believe that saying that the current textbooks do not have national thought is blind, and saying that the current textbooks are "anti-Japanese" is also a slander. A nation has its own independent spirit and glorious history. We want independence, we also resist aggression, and we do not want to invade others. We are only stating facts based on historical facts, not fabricating shouts. If the justice in the world has not been completely destroyed, who can say that we should not do so?</p>
<p>(IV) The Amount of Teaching Material Gradually Increases</p>
<p>The earliest textbooks, such as the Latest Chinese Language Enlightenment Textbook, did not have a small amount of material. Later, it was felt that classical Chinese was difficult to teach, so the amount was gradually reduced. The elementary school textbooks before 1921 had too little material, almost only a skeleton without muscles. After 1920, the language was changed from classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese, but the amount of material in elementary school textbooks did not increase. A textbook often had only 48 pages of 22-size newspaper, almost one and a half newspapers could be bound into a textbook. The most was only 64 pages, and the least was only 32 pages. Therefore, various teaching materials could not use words to fully narrate. Even the so-called children's literature was just a flat narration without any description, which was not worthy of the word "literature." Children who read such poor and pitiful textbooks gained too little. They could not connect with junior high school after graduating in six years. The most obvious thing is that junior high school textbooks have about two or three hundred pages per book, while elementary school sixth-grade textbooks only have fifty or sixty pages. Comparing the two, the ratio is roughly five to one. If you think about the amount of material differing so much, how can they connect? After 1931, the amount of material in elementary school textbooks gradually increased. Among them, one or two Chinese language textbooks, such as the World's New Chinese Language Reader and Er Yi's Children's Chinese Language Reader, increased the most. Some elementary Chinese language textbooks have as many as one hundred and seventy or eighty pages, and some advanced Chinese language textbooks have more than two hundred pages. Compared to before, the amount of material has increased several times, and the content is naturally richer. However, some textbooks still have very little material, especially arithmetic textbooks, which do not even have a few exercises.

<h3>Finance: Exchange Rate Hardens, Gold Market Besieged by Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>—Floating Rate Continues to Drop Five Dollars—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's confidence remained difficult to revive. Chinese merchants were excessively pessimistic about the US dollar and continued to sell off. The exchange rate remained firm, leading to easier activity for sellers. As a result, the market continued to fall by five dollars. Early in the morning, overseas dispatches reported that the British market was closed, and American banks showed no changes. Exchange rates had already contracted. Sentiment outside the market was very calm. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was still listed at 1144.6 yuan. In pre-market trading, the opening price was 50 yuan. Fuxing Yong sold short, falling to 6.5 yuan. Retail investors and Richang and others slightly absorbed, rising to over 7 yuan. The morning opened flat, and trading remained sideways, but selling pressure was heavier, leading to a breakdown. Banks remained actively buying, and buyers maintained support at lower prices, resulting in some rebound. HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, having little impact. China Merchants continued to sell off, stimulating selling pressure, making it difficult to boost sentiment. The market gradually moved downwards. The silver equalization tax was not listed, and banks took advantage of the depreciation to buy. There was much sideways trading after the fall, but the exchange rate remained loose, and banks' appetite also leaned towards buying near and selling far. The gold market remained difficult to support, allowing sellers to regain control. There was too much floating, and more liquidation flows followed, leading to a downward spiral. At noon, the situation became even more sluggish, and underlying sentiment was not optimistic. This was due to the solid short position of major players, which led to the decline in bond prices. Yesterday, the bond price rose to 7.8 yuan. The morning and afternoon market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1157.2 yuan, 0.1 yuan lower than the previous close. Dadecheng Hengyu advanced to 7.3 yuan. Zhichang, Dadecheng, Fuxing Yong, Richang, Yuanmao Yong sold off, falling to 5.5 yuan. Yuli HSBC bought February shillings at 375. Huixiang, Dingkang, Richang, Yicheng, Fuxing Yong came in, gradually rising to 7.4 yuan. HSBC's official exchange rate had little impact. China Merchants continued to sell foreign exchange, with Jinjiang, Huixiang, Xianghe, Tiancheng, Xiangying, Xiangfu, Xingyuan, Maoyong selling off, falling to 4 yuan. The silver equalization tax was not changed, having little impact. However, at this time, due to Fuxing Yong and Qiafeng Yong buying, it rose to 4.7 yuan. Wangfayong, Richang, Tongyu Run, Qiafeng, Chunyuan Yong, Yuansheng Yong, Shunmao sold off, falling to 3 yuan. Fuxing Yong and Richang Fusheng Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy strips. HSBC ate January US dollars at 8125, rising to 5.1 yuan. Dingkang, Chunyuan Yong, Dadecheng, Yingfeng Heng, Tongtaichang, Yuansheng Yong, Yuanmaoyong jointly supplied, falling to 1.4 yuan. Fuxing Yong Richang came in, rising to 2.4 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Hengyu sold again, to 1.3 yuan. Jiaotong ate January US dollars at 30 yuan. Dafayong, Chunyuanyong, Fuxing maintained, rebounding to 2.4 yuan. The noon closed at 1152.3 yuan. After the close, floating traders such as Richang sold off, falling to 1.5 yuan. Dafayong and others continued to buy, rising to around 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price based on the Central Bank's standard gold price was still 1144.6 yuan, about 8 yuan higher than the closing price, and 5 yuan lower than the previous close. February was recorded at 1144 yuan, March at 1152 yuan. The morning replenishment price was 1144 yuan, and the pure gold price was 1157.2 yuan. The spot market was stable. Pure gold was sold by local silver shops to Yingfeng Heng for over 100 taels, priced at 5 yuan more. Tianjin goods were priced at 6 yuan more, but there was no counter-trade. Due to Dafeng Hengyu, Xinxingxiang, Yuanmao Yong selling bonds, the bond price rose slightly. Initially, the multi-party sold bonds at 7.3 yuan, but lacking shorts, Dafeng Heng came to sell bonds, with Yingfeng Heng and Huixiang each buying 70 strips at 7.5 yuan. Dadecheng sold 35 strips to Fuxing Yong, and Dafeng Heng sold 21 strips to Tongfeng Heng, both at 7.5 yuan. Yuxinxiang sold 14 strips to Yingfeng Heng at 7.7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong sold 105 strips to Yicheng at 7.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was normal. Overall, Yuxinxiang, Qiafeng Yong, Dafayong, Yicheng, Dingkang, Fuyu, Hongkang, Yongfu, Qinyong, etc. were on the buying side, while Dadecheng, Shunmao, Huixiang, Hengchang Yong, Tongchun, Chang Hengyu, Tianfa, Yuansheng Yong, Fengchang, Zhongfeng, Richang, etc. were on the selling side. Dadecheng and Hengyu Richang advanced first and then retreated, Renfayong and Fuxing Yong retreated first and then advanced. The Dalian and Guangdong gangs remained inactive.</p>
<p>It was found that the half-day market was still weak. The morning opened at 1157.2 yuan, the highest price was 1157.4 yuan, the lowest price was 1151.3 yuan, and the noon closed at 1152.3 yuan, with a fluctuation of 6.1 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The total number of transactions in the half-day was 10,927 strips.</p>
<p>For the February strips that have not yet been settled, the multi-party accounts for over 800 from Dachangxiang, over 600 from Yingxiang, over 500 from Huixiang, over 300 from Hengchang Yong, over 200 each from Jingfu, Yuxinxiang, Qiafeng Yong, Hengyu, Yongfeng, and over 100 each from Futaiheng, Yicheng, Yuanmao Yong.

The chips totaled 12,936 strips, with 53 bulls and 32 bears.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Continue to Sell, Exchange Rate Hardens</h3>
<p>—Jiaotong Still Maintains Spot US Dollars—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate hardened because Chinese merchants were pessimistic about the future of the US dollar and continued to sell off. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that the British market was closed and the New York silver market was unchanged. The US dollar contracted by 1.25 against the British pound and by 1.75 against the French franc. The exchange rate opened in the morning, with the recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence 375 and 4375 against each other, and the American liquor at 29.9375 yuan, which was flat with British and American rates compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged, having little impact. After the opening, banks traded with each other, remaining flat. After entering the market, Chinese merchants suddenly came to supply. However, because HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with both British and American rates unchanged, the market was prosperous despite a slight loosening in the middle. The silver equalization tax was announced unchanged, and banks were still buying on the cheap, which was supportable. The remaining Chinese merchants still had a selling appetite, and the banks also threw away the near and far faces, so the process continued to ease. By the noon close, the recent selling price of British exchange was 1 shilling 2 pence 4375, and the American exchange was 29.9375 yuan and 30 yuan against each other, compared to the previous close, British and American each eased 0.03125, and the forward exchange eased 0.0625 for British and hardened 0.125 for US. Chinese merchants sold off about 300,000 US dollars. Central Communications and others still bought spot US dollars, and British-American Tobacco and Yuli slightly bought shillings. Chinese merchants also bought shillings. The half-day transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities: Ministry Order Restricts Speculation; Bond Rebound Suddenly Rises; Gold Short Soars by 3.6 Yuan; Trading Suspended Today and Tomorrow for Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the dispute from the previous day had been resolved. However, a Ministry order suddenly arrived, stating that from today onwards, all sales must be accompanied by the delivery of physical goods. Even previous short positions must pre-deliver the physical goods to the exchange. Although the market only trades February futures for one month, trading was still extremely active. When trading opened at 10:30 AM, due to the aforementioned Ministry order, floating short positions were aggressively covered, especially by retail investors. The price soared by several cents to three yuan. Yesterday and today were completely different, entirely dictated by the Ministry order. Without goods, short selling was impossible, and original short positions became panicked. Therefore, brokers held a meeting to save their existing short positions and exempt themselves from delivering physical goods. The exchange authorities have already turned to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. However, brokers often have both long and short positions, which balances out for the exchange. If the long positions want to sell and close out, it is considered a new transaction for the exchange, and according to the Ministry order, physical goods must be delivered. For brokers, it is simply closing out, so difficulties arise. Although the exchange allows for reconciliation on a case-by-case basis, brokers will suffer huge losses. In summary, the physical delivery requirement is the only good emergency method to protect the long positions and maintain market prices. However, rumors of interest rate cuts and postponements are not diminishing, causing fundamental damage, and physical goods will inevitably be squeezed out. On one hand, floating short positions disappear, and on the other hand, floating long positions increase sharply. At the same time, arbitrageurs are completely unable to act, because selling forward contracts requires physical delivery, and the arbitrageurs have not yet received the spot goods for this month. After several hours of discussion, no concrete solution had been reached, so the closing was delayed until after 5 PM before trading resumed. Because troop reductions were only slightly positive in the opening session, it then surged by 2.5 yuan. The 20th issue also rose by 1.89 yuan. However, sellers on the floor, such as the 5th, 16th, 33rd, 34th, and 43rd, were still very active, possibly with long positions exiting or physical goods flowing out. Their strength should not be underestimated. Therefore, it can be seen that the sellers at this time must have physical goods to deliver. As a result, the upward trend gradually weakened. The 22nd issue only rose by 0.3 yuan, and the 223rd issue even fell by 0.9 yuan. Positive 6 also fell back by 0.065 yuan. If the postponement becomes a reality, market prices may still not rise due to physical delivery. Market results: a large increase of several cents to several yuan, but gold shorts rose by as much as 3.6 yuan. The total turnover was about 20 million. The results of the increases and decreases are listed below. Today and tomorrow will be closed for two days to handle the settlement of January futures (unit: yuan).</p>
<h3>Currency Rumors Subside; American Stock Investors' Intentions Grow Stronger</h3>
<p>New China Foreign Trade reported that on the 28th, the New York stock market advanced under the leadership of railway stocks. Railway stocks reached a new high since 1934, and utility stocks rose to their highest level since 1933. Inflation rumors have subsided, and investors' intentions are strong. However, industrial stocks saw some profit-taking after the bulls profited, and steel stocks closed with little change from the previous day. General Motors announced its 1935 earnings, amounting to 3.69 yuan per share, compared to 1.9 yuan last year. Automobile stocks then soared, but profit-taking by bulls caused them to fall back. Farm equipment stocks rose sharply, and aircraft stocks were firm. Investors purchased large quantities of American Telephone and Telegraph. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that pension funds would be raised through orthodox methods, causing silver stocks to fall. In the bond market, government bonds were very strong, and small exchange stocks were firm. The total daily turnover was 2.29 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Decline; Yarn Futures Want to Rise but Turn Back</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a bleak trend. Actual yarn sales turned sluggish, and all groups had large backlogs. The total daily turnover was significantly lower than before, further discouraging sentiment. However, the bulls still insisted on not letting go, so the floor did not show much loosening. The afternoon opened with short covering, and there were many blank boards.</p>
<p>The Opening Session of the Marked Yarn Briefly Rebounded</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened higher in the morning due to the sharp decline the previous day, causing a sudden rebound. All months opened at higher prices, and the spot yarn business was active the previous day, with short covering, and the 22nd issue was very firm. By the closing, it was heard that the spot yarn market had declined significantly, and the Osaka Sampin yarn market had slightly weakened. As a result, all months rose by 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.09 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw all months decline, and the situation suddenly became weak. Because there were few new buyers in the market, only about 300 bales of spot yarn were traded, and the sentiment suddenly weakened. As a result, all months fell by 0.02, 0.04, and 0.07 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 850 bales were sold by Changfeng, 300 bales by Yuda, 750 bales by Dafeng, 300 bales by Daji, 200 bales by Xincheng, 200 bales by Taichang, and 200 bales by Shenji. 950 bales were bought by Runkang, 1,000 bales by Shengyuan, 800 bales by Tonghe, 5 bales by Renfeng, and 1,000 bales by Changfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Less Than 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were heavily cleared. A total of 453 bales were traded for the day, with average prices. The purchase amount for each group is listed below.</p>
<h3>Bull Absorption Prevents Letting Go; Cotton Market Relies on Support</h3>
<p>The cotton market was mediocre, but the bulls absorbed and did not let go, so the market state relied on support. However, the US cotton situation was still deteriorating, and there was some discussion that Indian cotton inventories were increasing, and the future was bearish. There were quite a few sellers.</p>
<p>Dachangcheng Buys Marked Cotton</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning, and US cotton was still weak and falling. The marked gold also presented a hovering situation. The Indian cotton market was closed due to the Emperor's funeral, and recent months were still flat and tired. However, when auctioning to distant months, the banking community came to buy again, and Dachangcheng kept buying in, and it turned to soar. After the second session, it fell back again. As a result, it was close to a rise of 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat and lifeless, but when auctioning to distant months, Tongji's long positions increased firmly. As a result, near months fell by 0.05 yuan, and distant months rose by 0.1 yuan. It was found that 2,100 piculs were sold by Hexing, 6,500 piculs by Gengfeng, 800 piculs by Yuanda, 2,700 piculs by Yuanxingchang, and 700 piculs by Yuanda. 3,800 piculs were bought by Tongji, 800 piculs by Yuda, 5,500 piculs by Dachangcheng, 1,100 piculs by Changfeng, 1,200 piculs by Changhe, 1,900 piculs by Senkang, 1,200 piculs by Runkang, and 1,300 piculs by Shengyuan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Shenxin and Wing On Start Buying</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales can still be maintained. Shenxin and Wing On are still diligently buying, with a source of 760 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Falls Again Due to Bull Profit-Taking; British and Indian Cotton Markets Are Closed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was sluggish. All months fell by 0.03 to 0.04 pounds. Overseas markets were closed, and there was no development in Washington, so the market situation was quite uneasy. It was first tired due to foreign merchants selling, and then it was recovered by the industry buying at limit prices. Finally, due to brokers, the South, and local groups selling, and bulls taking profits, it fell again slightly. Non-industry discussion was average, and both sides were cautious. The spot market was calm. As a result, spot prices fell by 0.1 pounds, and futures prices fell by 0.02 to 0.07 pounds. British and Indian cotton markets were closed due to the Emperor's funeral. The original telegram is recorded on the left (28th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for White Rose Creek cotton on the 29th was 201.5 rupees, a decrease of 1.25 rupees compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Rangoon Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>A Mumbai telegram on the 27th stated that the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 5,135 bales, including 200 bales to Dalian, 1,631 bales to Osaka, and 3,300 bales to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Grains: Financial Groups Buy Again; Flour and Wheat Soar Unabated</h3>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning, and the months were initially set, then jumping around. The Chicago quotation for foreign wheat fell by around 0.12 yuan, so it was initially calm. Then, because the delivery of this month was approaching, factories in other places all thought of returning to cover, and recent spot sales were also quite active, raising the sentiment, with a strong momentum for squeezing shorts. It was heard that financial groups were quite involved in distant months, and it was easy to raise prices because the factories claimed that they were short on supply. Therefore, the recent period immediately rose by 0.04 yuan, and the second, third, and fourth months soared by a huge 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. The sixth month new flour also rose to a maximum of 3.1 yuan due to recent events. When the afternoon market opened, because financial groups were buying again, the first, second, and third months rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan again. Then, large long positions unwound, and distant factories also sold short, so the third, fourth, and sixth months stepped back by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. However, this month is still strong because short positions are being squeezed. After further observation, it will be difficult for this month to fall.</p>
<p>Wheat prices all showed a consistent good sign, with meager bottom codes and a long way to go before the new harvest season. The sentiment inside and outside the industry has long been stable. Recently, the gradual increase in the flour market has attracted more attention from people in the industry, so the opening price immediately rose by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, and then rose again. When the afternoon market opened, the first month was raised by 0.07 yuan due to insufficient cargo volume, and it was heard that the money shop group had bought a large amount below the second month, causing the transaction to be very smooth. Fortunately, old long positions returned and customers sold short, so the upward trend stopped. However, in the current situation, it will be difficult to avoid a chaotic situation in the future. Spot wheat high-grade goods have not opened, and medium-grade goods have been raised by 0.05 yuan, opening Hankou wheat at 4.7 yuan, and second-grade at 4.64 yuan, handled by Fufeng Office with 1,000 bales, and Fuxin Office with 400 bales.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Driven by Bean Cake Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market, due to the active bean cake sales, the whole city traded about 46,000-47,000 pieces of futures and spot bean cakes, so the factory soybean intake continued, and the market continued to tighten by 0.03-0.04 yuan. The office went to the Chariot Wheel and various bean stores for more than 10,000 bags of various beans, with the Doudousha, Guangdong, and Shantou groups adopting more than 2,000 bags. The market was quoted at 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. The Siping Street Bean Shop of Guangdong compromised four carts, with the price up 0.05 yuan. The foreign village's sesame did not open due to selling and buying, and it was heard that the market had not yet left the closing price of 11.8 yuan. The foreign firm had a mine report to send out, and whether the transaction can be made depends on the domestic situation.</p>
<h3>Quanzhou and Shantou Groups Smoothly Handle Rough and Early Rice; Stockpiling Households' Intake Suddenly Surges</h3>
<p>Yesterday's early rice market was quite active, because the current customer demand continued to prosper, and there was a sudden surge in hoarding, with the Quanzhou group being very greedy yesterday in addition to the Shantou group. The Quanzhou and Shantou groups handled a total of more than 3,000 bags of Hekou, Shashi, and other unpolished rice, and the household's later demand was still active, and the market continued to look good. The four households absorbed more than 5,000 bags of Jiangxi late and Hunan oil rice. The intake of our street village was also good, with 2,000 bags of Wenzhou Liu early rice, 2,500 bags of Jiangxi early and late rice, yuan unpolished rice, etc., 600 bags of Shashi machine rice, and 200 bags of Cantonese rice. In terms of the market being filled with stockpiles, it seems that it can be temporarily stabilized, but after being handled by the local customers and hoarders, the price has gradually increased by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan to 0.1 yuan. Unpolished rice is relatively popular.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 10,000 Bags of Green, Red, and White Sugar Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to be tight for coarse white sugar, and the situation was flatter for green and red sugar. The Association's set price for 24 coarse sand spot goods was 22.75 yuan, up 0.1 yuan. Re-export goods traded at 7.65 yuan, up 0.05 yuan. East Red (NKC) was 16.65 yuan, and 8th White was called for 22.25 yuan, with re-exported YT at 7.25 yuan, and TK at 7.3 yuan, all with transactions. 9th White YRO was called for 21.85 yuan, and re-exported Tong was traded at 6.85 yuan. The local factory's fine white sugar rose again by 0.1 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 21.6 yuan, No. 2 was 21.4 yuan, No. 3 was 21.2 yuan, No. 4 was 21 yuan, and No. 5 was 20.8 yuan. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Corporation's marked exchange of 5,400 bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar was 22.7 yuan, up 0.05 yuan, all cleared through exchange. No. 2 Cantonese fine white was 21.45 yuan, and No. 4 was 21.25 yuan, both up 0.05 yuan, with a total of 230 bags traded. The Numbered goods had Chao Bang opening Afanti Estate Qing at 10.5 yuan, and Gao Huanggang Qing at 10.1 to 10.2 yuan, with a total of more than 2,000 bags traded. The Cantonese and Hong Kong groups opened more than 500 pieces of Beihai slice green, at 8.5 yuan, and the Jian group opened more than 1,000 bags of Diao green, priced at 9.5 yuan, and slightly lower for the latter.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Lily Buds Suddenly Rise by 3-4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Lily buds have recently become increasingly scarce in inventory and the trend has become very tight. Last night, there were reportedly dozens of bags, but the cargo owners were unwilling to sell much, and the traders' intention to buy was quite strong, so the opening price suddenly rose by 3-4 yuan. Today's market is bound to rise again.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Trade Still Waiting for Positive Market</h3>
<p>Because overseas silk prices continue to be low, the local positive market trading seems to still be waiting. Although the export firms have returned to work as usual the day before yesterday, manufacturers are all willing to see a little bit of good news before selling their goods, so there was no transaction the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Market Base Solid</h3>
<p>Since the hardware market opened, local printing factories, can factories, cigarette factories, etc., have purchased a lot of goods because they have seen that the tinplate market is very strong, opening to seven or eight hundred boxes. However, the circulation of goods in the market is becoming less and less, so the holders of the goods are in a surprisingly good mood, and the market base is more solid. For example, American goods, one hundred pounds double, have risen to fifty-two yuan due to the break block relationship. Ninety pounds of double is also in short supply, and the opening price is as high as forty yuan. The Italian and German goods are also excellent in the market because the arrival of goods cannot keep up. The opening price of ninety pounds of double Italian goods is thirty-seven yuan and five angles, and the German goods are thirty-six yuan and five angles. French goods are the most popular because there is a lot of stock, and the market is still opening at thirty-five yuan. Therefore, the transactions the day before yesterday and yesterday were the most refreshing for this goods. For British goods of ninety pounds single, 500 boxes of new goods have arrived at a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road, and the price is 17.5 yuan. It is reported that more than two hundred boxes have been sold. Customers such as Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Xuzhou were also very interested in the market yesterday. In addition, various tinplates were also quite active yesterday.</p>
<h3>Most Hardware Businesses Can Make a Profit</h3>
<p>Although the hardware industry was in a difficult situation last year, the result was still good. Although some companies suffered slight losses due to the impact of the sharp drop in the first order, Taiping closed down mostly due to differences in shareholder opinions, and most of them were still good. Among the large hardware businesses, there are more than 20 companies such as Yuanheng Yuanfeng Yichang Yongxing Zhenfeng Hengfeng Licheng Yukang Hengyu, and it is heard that the total profit is between 7,000-8,000 and 70,000-80,000. In addition, each company also has a profit of 4,000-5,000. The iron industry such as Yida Ruid Dajin Yike Chhengli and other companies are the best, and their profits are between 10,000 and 50,000. The small hardware industry is also doing well, but it has been badly affected by the bankruptcy of the Ningbo Money Shop, so the profits are relatively small. It is heard that Yuan Taiyong Tongchang Zhengji Xiang Da Yuan Rui Xin Shun Rui Chang Shun Shunli Hengda Xiangheng Da Chang are the best.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Pomelo Oil Industry's Year-End Profit</h3>
<p>White tung oil's export trade accounted for an important position last year. The full-year quantity, apart from silk and tea, can be second to none. However, foreign traders purchase and manage, and they delve into the inland areas. In places such as Wanxian in Sichuan and Changde in Hunan, various countries have set up shops and managed, so Hankou, which used to be a centralized market, is now on its last legs. Shanghai was originally a re-export place, and there were no goods exported locally. In recent years, due to the sharp increase in production in Zhejiang Province, this port has also exported, and it has been increasing year by year. By the year before last, there was a quantity of 10,000 tons, and last year there were about 12,000-13,000 tons exported, and a total of about 70,000-80,000 tons were re-exported from Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces, so those who deal in tung oil in this port are full of vitality. However, there are also quite a few people who also operate in foreign industries. For example, Ding Taide and Qianfeng, both miscellaneous grain stores, have been operating tung oil for several years, and their annual quantity is actually more than the tung oil industry, and the profits are also excellent. It is heard that both companies have hundreds of thousands of gold left over, while those who operate tung oil have been left behind. The year-end profits of the various tung oil industries in this port are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: A Review of the Cotton Cloth Industry Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry Association announced the operating conditions of the industry in the 24th year, saying that in recent years, my country's cotton cloth industry has been greatly increased by foreign factories in China, and the technical improvements of Chinese factories have gradually been able to replace imported cotton cloth with cheaper fabrics. Among the imported goods this year, Western goods are the most unique with cotton velvet, followed by poplin, foreign yarn, linen yarn, bleached cloth, adhesive cloth, Taixi, twill silk, warp marked cloth, raw cloth, fine cloth, etc. Among the Japanese goods, feather silk and foreign yarn are the most, followed by Yuehua velvet, flannel, and printed straight tribute. In total, there are less than 20,000 pieces. My country can imitate all except cotton velvet and Taixi, but there are few popular products. Most of the foreign textile factories in the factory are located in a corner of Shanghai. There are three British companies, and the production is mainly white goods. Their light-weight coarse cloth and cotton blankets have always been in a leading position in the market. Bleached cloth and willow bleached cloth used to be widely sold, but recently they have gradually been taken over by Chinese goods. In addition, there is one bleaching, dyeing, and printing factory, which issues blue cloth, bleached cloth, printed pique, and solid printed cloth, which are sold well throughout the country. There are a total of 30 Japanese factories, and the production volume is huge. Color goods are mainly single-thread pique, straight tribute, printed cloth, printed straight tribute, and bleached cloth. White goods are mainly grey cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and eight-four cloth. Domestic and foreign sales are smooth. The raw material grey cloth required by our country's bleaching, dyeing, and printing factories also depends on it, so if the market sales are prosperous, there will be a shortage. Qingdao Japanese factories also have a large number of white goods, which are transported to Shanghai for sale. My country's textile printing and dyeing industry has also gradually developed, and the items and quantities of color goods have been greatly expanded, which is enough to meet the needs of the domestic market. However, fine cloth, fine twill, and eight-four cloth, the main road white goods, are inferior in technology and higher in cost. In addition, the anti-goods movement in Zhejiang and Fujian has been eliminated, and sales have decreased, so they have all shifted their attention to color goods and grey cloth. This year, the domestic financial panic became increasingly urgent. January and February were before and after the Lunar New Year's Day. In the past, there were stockpiles and red market transactions, but now there are very few transactions. The spring goods, as late as the end of March and April, began to launch, and each road was quite active, especially the wholesale in this street, and the area along Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, and the Yangtze River was the most active. And when the end of April was approaching, the silver root was urgent, and the transaction was declining again. Only Sichuan and Yunnan handled smoothly. In May and June, only Shantou, Xiamen, Sichuan, and Zhejiang had poor sales. The rest of the land was quiet. In July and August, each road improved, and September and October were especially lively. Tianjin, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shantou, Xiamen, this street, and the various ports along the Yangtze River, as well as Shandong for a long time, all started buying autumn and winter goods, until the end of November. In these three months, color goods and white goods were all surprisingly popular, and because of the soaring financial situation and the shrinking foreign exchange, the cost gradually increased, and the hoarding households rose up, and the market price soared. By the time the cash concentration was implemented, the people's minds were increasingly firm. However, this kind of extra transaction was purely promoted by the stimulation of the managed currency policy, so at the end of the year, although there are more profits than losses among the industry, considering the declining purchasing power of the domestic people, and the increasing loss of economic interests and territorial sovereignty, it seems that it is not possible to achieve the prosperity of the cotton cloth industry in one fell swoop. The association convened a temporary members' meeting at the Jinli Office at 2 p.m. on the 27th to discuss various goods markets. See the market prices of the previous day.</p>
<p>The woolen cloth industry has also opened its doors and the transaction launch period will have to wait another ten days. The numbers of woolen cloth in previous year that were liquidated included Hongxing, Yuanda, Qiafeng, Fuxing, etc., those who changed the numbers were Yuehuakang, Wancheng Yong, Quanjit, etc., those who merged were Shengchang, Yishengxiang etc, those who relocated included Fengyu, Yukang, etc., those who magnified and expanded included Hongxiang, Fuxin, etc., and there was almost no new founder, only temporary sales yards such as the Chessboard Street Market and Datong etc. The comparison table for the market prices of various colors of woolen material over the past year is on the left.</p>

<h3>Hegel on Chinese History</h3>
<p>— Li Jianfang</p>
<p>Hegel, the spirit of modern historical philosophy, frequently discussed Chinese history in his magnum opus, *Philosophy of History*. Although a philosophical idealist and lacking understanding of many Chinese realities, some of his criticisms and insights regarding Chinese history remain significant even today.</p>
<p>The purpose of this short essay is neither to unconditionally accept Hegel's analysis and arguments about Chinese history, nor to critique them—neither is it. The sole purpose of this essay is to summarize the opinions of this great and profound philosopher from his era regarding our history, which still hold relevance today, for the reference of our countrymen and historians. I believe that some of Hegel's criticisms of the spiritual development of the Chinese nation are invaluable insights for our ancient nation when seeking to understand itself. Accepting Hegel's guidance is far more meaningful than accepting the cheap flattery from international celebrities and scholars who, though internally filled with national prejudice, spare no praise for us due to certain reasons or benefits while traveling China.</p>
<p>Enough idle talk. Now, let us briefly describe Hegel's views on the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Hegel divides the terrain of activity for various nations in the world into three types: first, highlands without river irrigation; second, plains or basins with river irrigation; and third, coastal areas. The terrain of activity for the Chinese nation belongs to the second type.</p>
<p>What is the importance of geographical relations? No, Hegel and even Marx highly valued the geographical factors in history. Because the Chinese nation's terrain of activity belongs to the first type, the Chinese nation benefited from river sedimentation very early on and began its civilization. Agriculture quickly reached a level of proficiency, and the legal system for communal living followed suit. Because agriculture is important for "forecasting," science and art also emerged simultaneously. Therefore, a great civilized empire was established here very early.</p>
<p>Although this nation developed a brilliant cultural life in ancient times, it was limited to its own interior. It had no involvement with the principle of the sea, or at least it did not interact with the principle of the sea when completing its unique principle. And even if it had interacted with the principle of the sea, that principle could not have served as a factor in the nation's culture and education. This nation could only have a more advanced historical relationship when visited or explored by others. Therefore, when this nation's spiritual life reached a certain height, it stagnated without external forces.</p>
<p>However, speaking generally from the history of national development, the spiritual development of mankind or nations is similar to the growth of children. Children can only become more independent of their parents as their bodies and minds advance. And nations can only enter a state of freedom by becoming more detached from the dictates of nature as their spirit becomes more developed. But if a nation's spiritual development is limited by its natural environment, that nation may have a spiritual life, but it cannot be said to be a free nation.</p>
<p>According to Hegel, the spiritual development of mankind can be divided into the following three stages: first, the stage where the spirit is immersed in nature; second, the stage where the spirit has detached from nature and entered consciousness, but because it is directly born from naturalness, it is related to nature and bears the incomplete freedom stage of the obligation of elements; third, the stage of pure and universal freedom of the spirit. The spiritual life of the Chinese nation has always been in the first stage. Therefore, no matter how many great men and sages this nation has produced in the past, their various moral rules and natural laws are the result of external positive commands, mandatory rights and mandatory obligations, or regulations of etiquette between each other, and the freedom of human conscience is completely lacking within this nation. Morality is the business of the state and is enforced by the government and judges. An abstract subjective image, that is, the image of virtuous men and sages, becomes the pinnacle of doctrine and thought in China. Therefore, within this nation, despite its reflective philosophy and arts, it cannot elevate them to the position of master of nature, but always remains in the position of slave to nature.</p>
<p>This is my excerpt of Hegel's criticism of the Chinese nation from more than a hundred years ago. I do not know whether our nation, which has not made much progress in this long period, and especially now, has actually changed Hegel's criticisms and instructions on our weaknesses, and whether it has made Hegel's criticisms and instructions lose their timeliness?</p>
<p>However, this is not enough. There are even more frightening instructions below! As long as this nation of the plains is content with the status quo, it will inevitably continue to move towards death. There are two reasons for death: one is the cessation of facilities and the ineffectiveness of politics brought about by the satisfaction of internal demands and the depletion of the spirit, and the other is the invasion of nomadic peoples from the highlands and commercial peoples from overseas. China's external troubles before the Opium War were the former, and the external troubles after the Opium War were the latter. Naturally, the latter is more severe than the former.</p>
<p>Due to satisfaction with the status quo, this nation has given up on many aspects. It has fallen into lifeless habits and is moving towards natural death. Although it can still live a life of decadence for a long time, this vitality is only the vitality of individual special interests, no longer the vitality of the nation. Therefore, it is inevitable that this nation will suffer disasters and be enslaved. After each major historical disaster, it always takes decades or even centuries to be reborn from death. And when the new rebirth reaches a certain limit, a terrible death begins again.</p>
<p>In other words, the national history of China is like Guo Moruo's poem "The Nirvana of the Phoenix":</p>
<p>The sky is dim,</p>
<p>The fragrant wood is piled high,</p>
<p>The phoenix is tired of flying,</p>
<p>The female phoenix is tired of flying,</p>
<p>The phoenix pecks at the fragrant wood, sparks of fire burst forth.</p>
<p>The female phoenix fans the sparks, strands of fragrant smoke rise.</p>
<p>The phoenix pecks again,</p>
<p>The female phoenix fans again,</p>
<p>The fragrant smoke on the mountain dissipates,</p>
<p>The firelight on the mountain fills the air.</p>
<p>Enough! Enough! Enough!</p>
<p>Five hundred years of tears pour down like a waterfall,</p>
<p>Five hundred years of tears drip like candles!</p>
<p>The spring tide has risen,</p>
<p>The spring tide has risen,</p>
<p>The dead universe is reborn!</p>
<p>Although it is reborn, although it is reborn, but because it cannot, like the histories of Western nations, transform and reshape itself from a return to youth, and devote all its efforts to sublimate itself, it will soon have to sing the poet's "Phoenix Nirvana" grass again. The spiritual life of the Chinese nation has never gone beyond this cycle in the past. This is Hegel's understanding of Chinese history. This can also be said to be the exhortation of this great idealist philosopher to us!</p>
<h3>On Abridged Novels</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yong</p>
<p>Recently, Kaiming Bookstore published several abridged versions of old novels, calling them Abridged Novels, meaning that the "dross" components of the original books have been deleted, leaving only the "elite," so that the original books are very "clean" and suitable for young people to read. In fact, there are many places that still need to be considered.</p>
<p>When reading novels, the most important thing is to be able to understand the author's full personality, thoughts, and the era in which he lived; secondly, the content of the novel. As for the fun of the plot and the training of rhetoric, they should be secondary matters. If what we need is only the "elite" of the fun of the plot, then the attitude of reading novels only to pursue fun is really not desirable; if it is said that what we need is only the training of rhetoric "elite," then it seems that old novels are to be used as models for young people's language courses, and it is problematic to not use old novels as models, and whether old novels can be used as models for modern writing is also a problem; if you want to use abridged versions to express the author's full personality, thoughts, and the era in which he lived, then undoubtedly the original will express it more completely than the abridged version. Therefore, whether abridged novels are really suitable for young people to read is a question.</p>
<p>Speaking of the time issue of young people's extracurricular reading, abridged novels do not necessarily help much. Because abridged novels cannot give people complete satisfaction, readers will inevitably have to further seek and read the original, on the one hand, based on the reader's enterprising and curious psychology requires complete satisfaction, on the other hand, we are also convinced that the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, *Water Margin*, and *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* themselves also have this magic power, so the so-called abridged novels are actually just telling young people to read the abridged version again, which only increases and does not decrease in time.</p>
<p>So the only reason left is: abridged novels are more "clean" after being abridged. Next, we feel that the originals of the three abridged novels that have been published by Kaiming are all widely circulated and well-known novels: Intellectual youths know that it is easier to make choices, but it is absolutely impossible to make abridged novels circulate to the general public. The superstitious legends such as Zhuge Liang borrowing the east wind, the heavenly stars and earthly evil spirits engraved on the stone tablet, and the spiritual stone reincarnating as Bao Yu will never affect the thoughts of young people because they are printed on the original, because the scientific knowledge instilled in the textbooks is enough for young people to clearly understand; and the rest, the deleted ones, young people can still get from the original. Also, *Journey to the West* is also a widely circulated old novel, its writing is free and lively, and the plot is also fortunate to be interesting. However, how will the abridger start? Because there is no way to start, it is okay not to include it in the abridged novels, but the vast number of readers of *Journey to the West* will never decrease.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to practice the original purpose of the abridged novels, to make readers (not limited to young people) know which part of this novel should be discarded as "dross," and what should be absorbed as "elite," and to know what to choose; then publishing a few more volumes of old novels reading methods or novel appreciation methods, or "Dream of the Red Chamber Reading Method," "How to Read Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms Appreciation Method," etc., would be more practical work. However, the publication of a book, the publisher has its own business acumen.</p>
<h3>Review of "Scientific Life"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>Publisher: Nanjing Central University Scientific Life Monthly Magazine.</p>
<p>In all magazine companies, it is easy to detect a painful and shameless trend exposed in the magazine industry: using copper images of movie stars and nude photos to attract the reader groups of ladies and gentlemen who live a leisurely life. Publishers are only working hard to make money: they don't care about the responsibility of guiding culture.</p>
<p>If someone does a statistical survey: it can be as shocking as the monthly statistics of imported cosmetics:</p>
<p>"Within five feet, it will cause a cold and lead poisoning." Who says the poison of low-level taste is not more powerful than lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Publishers do not have the courage to run boring scientific publications; they will undoubtedly lose money and be completely defeated; a few students from Central University recently paid out of their own pockets to start a "Scientific Life"; it is really a bold attempt (it is said that each issue only sells three or four hundred copies.) In addition to introducing this fragile little life with a sincere attitude; we also want to make a faithful exploration of the content;</p>
<p>The degree of this magazine is suitable for junior high school students, and the content is all short stories, divided into "Scientific Forum," "Scientific Current Affairs Commentary," "Scientific World"; "Scientific Knowledge"; "Scientific Communication"; "Scientific Dialogue"; "Scientific Trends"; "Scientific Comics"; "Strange News Follow-up," etc.</p>
<p>After reading two volumes of "Scientific Life"; I admire the spirit of the Central University students' efforts; at the same time, reason is stirring up its own judgment!</p>
<p>The following points of view have occurred:</p>
<p>The material is not serious enough——The purpose of scientific books is to instill knowledge first; empty and cliché ones should be avoided as much as possible; such as the ordinary principle of wireless electricity in the "Scientific Knowledge" column in the second issue; it is superfluous text, and the "Scientific Comics" column; is too boring; it has no true instructions.</p>
<p>The introduction should be increased——The introduction of the shape and principle of various new inventions is widely lacking, and the science of the times does not need negative criticism, but should focus on positive exploration.</p>
<p>In any case, the efforts of the colleagues of "Scientific Life" are admirable. In this era when young people all over the country are hesitating and wandering; we look forward to a solemn academic style to sweep away all the dirty vulgar fog. The trend of "Scientific Life" is what we are looking forward to.</p>
<h3>Introduction to a Chinese Engineering Stationery Book (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>Literary Products——This is further divided into two sections: known year of creation and unknown year of creation, indicating the temporal relationship of the work's production.</p>
<p>Remarks——This is an appendix of evidentiary materials.</p>
<p>In addition, on the shoulder of the book, *Treatises on Food and Money* from various historical books are quoted to show the social situation at that time. This combines historical facts, years, literary products, and the birth and death of writers to form a large organization, which is really a pioneering work and the only feature of this book.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to this book, and I will now mention the important ones:</p>
<p>Wide Range of Collection: He said in the preface:</p>
<p>"Regarding the literary works of various eras——poems, fu, ci, songs, novels——all are collected when seen, so the selection of authors is also determined by those who have literary works circulating today. However, if it is like Lu Jia and Mei Gao, although there are examinable extant chapters, their position in literature is truly indelible; their biographies are attached to show the changes." From this point of view, you can know how many authors he has collected. There is absolutely no prejudice or distinction between factions, which is really the attitude that historians should have, and is beyond the reach of other books.</p>
<p>Strict Selection of Materials: The selection of materials for this book is completely centered on philology; therefore, the current events he recorded are mostly detailed in social aspects, such as wars, famines, and immigration; the writer's biographies are also biased towards character and environment, and there is little explanation of official positions; this is also his characteristic, which makes us unable to but admire his caution and strictness in the selection of materials. Furthermore, those whose years are unverifiable are marked with a "doubt" below, which is even more of the ancient meaning of "what is unknown, is left out," unlike the recent people who like to be far-fetched and arbitrary.</p>
<p>Precise Remarks: This is another feature of this book. From his remarks, we can get a lot of materials and strong evidence. Take Qu Yuan on the first page as an example, he said in the "Author's Birth" column: "The birth of Yuan was probably in the year of Wu Yin." He did not provide strong evidence; but in the remarks, he quoted *The Examination of Years of Doubt* to prove it, which made his previous words have a basis. There are many other selections of literary commentaries, such as page three of the first volume quoting Liu Zihou, page thirty-four quoting Fang Yizhi's *Poetry Talk*, and page thirty-four of the third volume quoting Yan Min's *Family Instructions on Bamboo Grove Poetry Criticism*, etc.; which are very helpful for our reference when studying literature.</p>
<p>Detailed Marginal Notes: The marginal notes quoted are all *Treatises on Food and Money* from various historical books; he quoted them separately according to the era; this is extremely helpful when studying the background of literary production. It is also a feature of this book.</p>
<p>The above are all the most important things. Other things, such as the map and table of the authors' birth areas and the surname index attached to the fourth volume, provide great convenience to the readers.</p>
<p>However, this book is not without its negotiable points. I personally think that a Jiazi column should be added below the Gregorian calendar column, because in ancient Chinese records, there are often cases where only the Jiazi is written without writing the dynasty or the number of years; this point seems to be particularly noted. Also, there should be a dividing line between years, to make the eyebrows clear; as for spending a little more paper, that can't be taken into account. I hope that these two points can be added and modified in the next edition.</p>
<p>In short, this is a literary tool book worth introducing. It is a pity that only the first compilation has been published; according to the author, there are five compilations that have not been published. I personally hope that he can come out as soon as possible to supply this famine-stricken publishing industry.</p>

<h3>The True Face of Imperialism</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The interests of imperialism and weak nations are always in conflict. As long as imperialism exists in the world, it will be difficult for weak nations to raise their heads. In the Abyssinian War, the two countries of Britain and France seemed to be very helpful to Abyssinia on the surface, but in fact, they were completely planning for their own interests. Looking at their advocacy of sanctions and division at the League of Nations, one can know their intentions. And recently, according to news from Paris, the powers believe that if the African nation wins over a strong European country, it will not only affect the balance of power among European powers, but also endanger the peace and order of the colonies. Therefore, the League of Nations is now organizing a survey committee to be sent to Abyssinia to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the war situation, and then take the opportunity to propose a peace plan to be submitted to the League of Nations to seek a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian problem. This peace plan should not only pay attention to Italy's needs, but also affirm Europe's assistance to Abyssinia. At the same time, London also reported that the British government now wants to find a way to end the East African war as soon as possible. This intention is not entirely for the success of the League of Nations policy, but to take care of Italy, because in the near future, Italy may become an important factor in maintaining the balance of power in Europe, so it cannot be allowed to consume its economic and military strength for colonial events.</p>
<p>It is certainly not what the powers want for Italy to monopolize Abyssinia, but it is even less what the powers like for Abyssinia to defeat Italy. The reason is that Abyssinia's brave resistance has aroused the excitement of weak nations all over the world. If Abyssinia defeats Italy, a strong European country, the weak nations will definitely increase their confidence and fight for liberation against the oppressors. This is unfavorable to imperialism, which will make them unable to rest easy. The powers are worried that if the African nation wins over a strong European country, it will not only affect the balance of power among European powers, but also endanger the peace and order of the colonies. That is what it means. Therefore, they now want to come up with a peace plan and urgently seek a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute.</p>
<p>In the East African War, the two sides have been holding each other for more than three months. Although Italy won a great victory at first, the recent military progress has been very slow, and it has repeatedly reported failures. On the one hand, Italy's domestic economy has also felt very difficult due to the League of Nations' sanctions. Moreover, the rainy season has now arrived, and the march is even more obstructed, and Italy really has no certainty of winning in the future of the war. Therefore, Italy's attitude towards the East African dispute has recently changed. According to news from Geneva, it is said that there is now reason to believe that any practical peace proposal submitted today will receive a treatment that is very different from what Rome had a few weeks ago, but who will propose it is really a difficult question. From this point, we can see that Italy's recent arrogance is not as strong as it used to be. At the same time, it can also be understood that the powers want to quickly resolve the Italian-Abyssinian incident.</p>
<p>What imperialism relies on to survive is colonies. If the peace and order of the colonies is shaken, it will certainly not be their blessing. Therefore, when the powers saw that the East African war had become a stalemate, they felt uneasy, began to care about the colonies, and urgently wanted to use peaceful methods to make Abyssinia submit in order to suppress the weak nations of the world. According to reliable sources, influential people in British political circles have recently suggested to the government that the British government should initiate a peace conference so that some current treaties can be revised in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, so that the desires of Germany and Germany in the territorial economy and colonies can be satisfied. This is the re-division of the world's weak nations by the powers. This matter was also said by the British diplomatic representative at the League of Nations not long ago. If this conference can be realized in the future, the weak nations will be manipulated by the powers again, allowing them to compete for beauty.</p>
<p>Dividing the world's weak nations to maintain their own survival is the true face of today's imperialism. If weak nations want to get rid of the pain of oppression by the powers in the future, the only way out is to unite into a front and fight them to the death.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Needle Room</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The second day after returning to my hometown, I went to the west of the town to see my maternal grandmother. Her courtyard was empty and silent, without a single person. Knowing that everyone else had gone out, but my third uncle with the limp wouldn't, I stood in the courtyard and raised my voice to shout:</p>
<p>"Is Third Uncle home?"</p>
<p>"Huh, who's there?"</p>
<p>"It's me,"</p>
<p>"Da Xiang? Come in,"</p>
<p>Lifting the burlap curtain, I stepped into the room, which was still so dim, as if shrouded in a thick black smoke. Third Uncle was standing by the table, wrapping medicine. When he turned around, he smiled at me and tidied up the things on the table, hobbling and stumbling on his right leg, which had been broken when he joined the Boxers. He walked to the edge of the bed and sat down, pointing to the yellow, damp mat and saying to me:</p>
<p>"Sit down, sit down. When did you come home?"</p>
<p>Because under that window inside, there was a woman with bare arms giving herself a morphine injection, I was afraid of affecting her light, so I sat down by the stove. Her left index and middle fingers pinched the syringe, her thumb trembling as she pressed down on the medicine. The needle bit into her right arm, which was covered in purple spots. As the medicine from the syringe slowly decreased, the flesh gradually swelled up, forming a blister shaped like half a broad bean. The syringe became emptier and emptier. She quickly put down the needle and gently scratched the blister, which was full of morphine juice. She stretched out her crossed legs a little at a time, swaying her whole body back and forth, her hands still rubbing incessantly. After a while, she squinted her eyes, leaned against the wall, and became lost in her stupor.</p>
<p>Third Uncle took the needle, filled a small medicine cup with water, and held the needle tip against the bottom of the cup. He held the syringe in his right hand and pinched the plunger with his left thumb and index finger, pulling it back. When the syringe was full of white water, he tilted the needle upwards and squirted it at the window paper, which made a slight sound. I couldn't help but think that although this delicate little water pipe was not as crude as the city's tap water, which easily made students faint, many of our compatriots were doing everything they could to scrape together money to buy this little poison pipe and inject themselves, falling into a daze, numbing themselves, and slowly decaying to death.</p>
<p>When my uncle was young, he was a clever and capable man. When he was in his thirties, he stabbed a love rival to death for a woman in Guanwai, and had to abandon his lover and run home. Because he brought back some money, he hooked up with a girl from a opium den in town after returning to his hometown, and then learned to inject morphine, becoming poorer day by day. The girl also left with someone else. He knew he had lost out, so he learned a skill from his loss and opened a pharmacy needle room in his own home. He didn't leave the house all day, earning enough to feed himself and satisfy his addiction, and he was content to muddle through life.</p>
<p>He looked at me for a long time, unable to think of anything to say, rolled his eyes, which were very large, and took a breath, saying:</p>
<p>"Is Guanwai under the jurisdiction of Emperor Xuantong at this moment, or under whose jurisdiction?"</p>
<p>"Under whose? Xuantong is just a puppet!"</p>
<p>He didn't pay attention to what I said, but remembered the things he had done in Guanwai, and couldn't help but tell a string of stories: how thick the snow was in Guanwai, how people wore shoes made of Hu La grass to get through the winter, how he did not know where those foreign prostitutes in Harbin came from, how rich the place was, how sorghum profits were bigger than small palm fans, and how foreign money could be collected with a basket. At the end, he excitedly pulled it to his glorious and emotional event:</p>
<p>"If I hadn't killed that bastard, I would never have come back, and I wouldn't have gotten this damn thing."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he carefully placed the medicine needle on the mat. At this time, the woman climbed down from the bed. She handed Third Uncle three dollars in bills, clutched the five small paper packets that had been wrapped on the table in her palm, and shuffled out of the house in her two sharp feet, dragging broken men's shoes. Third Uncle held the banknotes up to the window paper to examine the patterns. After looking at two of them, he examined the last one from the Hebei Provincial Bank again and again, looking very worried. I leaned over and looked and said:</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Some bastards in the county are selling fake Hebei Provincial Bank notes. You can buy a hundred dollars for thirty dollars. If the business is bad and you use a fake one, it'll be ruined!"</p>
<p>"How can you tell?"</p>
<p>He pointed to the grey circle and said:</p>
<p>"Look, there's a dark tower here. The fake ones don't have it."</p>
<p>I admired my uncle's cleverness, but I also found it strange that previously, a patron like the one who had just left would at most buy two strings of cash, but now it was three dollars at once. Third Uncle said that business was bad, so I didn't believe him.</p>
<p>"Business is still bad?"</p>
<p>"Heh," he untied his leg strap, put the three banknotes in his sock, and wrapped it tightly with the strap. Then he said, "You don't know, our luck is bad. Lai Shui, Zhuozhou, several counties are recruiting self-government armies. Although it's done secretly, they're even bolder than if it were done openly. The pay there is not only money, but also morphine. All the addicts in the surrounding villages have gone to them. Who am I going to sell to? The woman who just left, her husband is in Guo Datuzi's headquarters in Zhuozhou! She said someone transported a truckload of morphine. Da Xiang, how much money do you think that is? They also give out white flour (heroin), saying that if they take Zhuozhou City, everyone will get an ounce. You can take as much morphine and white flour as you want. Sigh," he patted his broken leg. "If it wasn't for this evil thing, I could have been a company commander!"</p>
<p>On his thin, yellow cheeks, which were gradually turning red, there was a bit of resentment against fate, but also a bit of emotion. He also picked out a small paper packet from the small white iron can on the head, shook it into the cup, filled the needle with water from the teacup, and injected the glittering white powder like a hydraulic cylinder. He was going to take another shot. I told him I was going to the north room to see if my maternal grandmother had come back yet.</p>
<p>He nodded and smiled, then peeled off his trouser leg, revealing his thin, shriveled leg. I lowered my head and walked out.</p>
<h3>On the Blockhouse</h3>
<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>Once you've lived in the countryside for three or four days, you gradually start to feel bored. What's more, being stuck in a blockhouse all day, slaving away for this batch of southern goods, makes you feel even more impatient and bored. Sometimes, when I'm extremely bored, I can only sing a little tune on the cramped floor to relieve the accumulated stuffiness. Otherwise, I'll just go to sleep in my clothes. As long as Old Yan isn't home, no one cares how much we mess around. Anyway, Hu Datou treats us very politely, so naturally he won't bother with us rough fellows.</p>
<p>At night, Old Yan didn't know where he had gone to mess around. He didn't come back until dawn. We went to bed very early, leaning our guns against the bedside to prevent anything from happening in the middle of the night. Soon after I lay down, Old Song suddenly got up from the bed, as if something was on his mind. I turned over in bed to see what he was doing. He went to the table and poured himself a cup of tea, turned up the kerosene lamp a little, and sat down on the chair next to the table. He took a sip of tea, turned around and saw that I was staring at him with wide eyes. He smiled, "Little Zhuang, are you still awake?" I nodded, and he walked closer to the bed and groaned, "Being stuck in here all day is really suffocating. I slept too much during the day, so I can't sleep at night. It's really hard... Damn it, I'm planning to go outside tomorrow to stretch my legs. What do you think? We can take turns to change shifts, so we don't all get depressed to death..." I stared at his round eyes and thick eyebrows, nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>He didn't notice me watching him, but looked up gloomily, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, a shoddy local product. He pulled out two cigarettes and handed one to me, turned to the kerosene lamp to light the cigarettes, and then sank into deep thought. I felt that Old Song's expression was a little strange tonight, but I didn't want to ask him anything. The guy was very clever and didn't easily reveal his own thoughts to others. So I had to keep quiet, letting the terrible silence occupy this gloomy world.</p>
<p>Old Song pondered for a while, gradually seeming to notice me paying attention to him. He glanced at me, then immediately patted my shoulder. "Little Zhuang, did you send money home for the New Year? New Year's, ah, it's really not easy. This is a hurdle, almost like a life-or-death crisis! It's really not easy for those who don't have money to get through it. Do you remember Zai Bing, who used to be with us? He killed himself because he couldn't get through the New Year! I'm really worried—" He suddenly seemed to remember something, and stopped talking. He looked at my face, hesitating, as if he wanted to say something but couldn't. I also knew that he had a great hidden pain, but he had always been an extremely tolerant and self-controlled person, always hiding everything in his heart. Because of this, he always harbored infinite pain and sorrow. Often in a terrible silence, his desolate heart would often fight against this bitter endurance. I could always see such a situation from his distressed expression, and tonight was a good example...</p>
<p>Looking at his hesitant expression, I felt a little sad in my heart. I suddenly reached out from the quilt and grabbed Old Song's arm, staring at his gloomy face and said dejectedly, "Old Song, don't you even trust me? Every time I see you wanting to say something but stopping, but your stomach is always full of thoughts. I've seen this situation too many times. You never want to say it, and I naturally understand your difficulties, but we've known each other for so many years, why should we be so formal! To be honest, Old Song, I feel a little sad whenever I see you hesitating like that. I think you must not trust me very much!"...</p>
<p>His hot eyes looked at me, he shook his head, and then turned back, saying in a hoarse voice: "Little Zhuang, I believe you! But I don't have anything good to tell you, I am really too sad. I've coerced people, and I've even been forced by Boss Xu to coerce my own partners. It's really sad to think about! If it wasn't for me, pressing Boss Xu for debts so fiercely, Old Wang would never have killed himself! I really feel so painful whenever I think of him, that sturdy old partner! Why did I have to be so fierce? …This year, I received a letter from home saying that it’s difficult to get through the New Year, and I'm really worried that my elderly father won't be able to bear it and will go down the same road!…" He didn't say any more, and I found that his eyes were filled with crystal tears.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he patted my shoulder and said: "Alas, Little Zhuang, it's really hard to make a living in this business, it's a dead end, there's no future or benefit in it! I've done too many wrong things, I was too young and had no ideas, and I fell into someone's trap just because of a moment of impulsiveness! I really regret it now!…"</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. I didn't expect that my few words would make Old Song, who was usually taciturn, feel so sad. Seeing that his sadness seemed to be expanding, I had to comfort him for a while. Just then, the dog started barking wildly. Everyone was startled, and we heard footsteps outside the village, and the sound of the fourth watch bamboo clapper also sounded. Gradually, the night was silent again.</p>

<p>Opening Piece: "Spring Boudoir Complaint"</p>
<p>Thousands of reds and purples in the bright spring sky. Weak willows covering the blue smoke. The spring is like a brocade in the eyes. My heart is full of tears. Counting the twelve railings of the painted balustrade. Also, the green grass invades the curtain before the steps. I was born a melancholic girl. I feel drowsy all day long. Especially since the eyebrow-painting man left. The double fish have been unable to deliver letters. I want to weave a palindromic poem to send. But it is impossible. The water is far and the mountains are long and there are thousands of roads. Feelings are deep. The intentions are endless. Secretly use money to predict the future. Alone I do not sleep in the silver jar. No dreams on the solitary quilt are like years. Afraid to embroider mandarin ducks in front of the window. The thread of the thread always pulls the hatred. Lonely in the deep boudoir, shadows accompany each other. Burning incense is too lazy to add. Afraid to see the purple swallows murmuring on the roof. Afraid to see the butterflies dancing in pairs. Who can I tell the hatred in my heart. I can only pity myself for all kinds of sadness. Helpless, he has not fulfilled his wish to be ennobled. Pity me, youth passes away and years are mistaken. All that is left is the flowers on the building laughing alone.</p>

<p>Opening Piece: "Simple Prodigy"</p>
<p>A gust of west wind blows across the east. Passing the small bridge, I saw an old fisherman. Three meals a day as a subsidy. I am. I am trying my best to study. Suddenly I heard three knocks on the chai door. I saw torches and lanterns. The servants all dispersed. Only the beautiful girl was left alone. Could it be. Classmates come to tease. Could it be. Demons in the mountains meet. Miss, listen. Call husband. Not a wall flower. I am not an unknown girl. My father is called Ma Rong in the court. Greedy for wealth, I will offer you as a gift. Offered to Liang Ji as the West Palace. I don't want to follow the traitor. Therefore, I. I wrote a poem on the wall. My father happened to see it. A great thunder in my heart. I only saw that the first couplet was. Fame will bring wealth. The second couplet is. Wealthy days will turn poor. I will send the governor to arrest you. Arrest clearly offer to the husband. Simple student, listen. Face flushed. I think thousands of gold. Why bother to go to jail. I think lady. Living in hall at home. Difficult to live is. The wall collapses and the house is full of wind. The lady is serving her with servants at home. Difficult to live is. A solitary lamp accompanied in the room. The lady is. Eating delicacies at home. Difficult to live is. Three meals a day often fall empty. The lady is. Wearing silk and satin at home. Difficult to live is. The two shoulders are bare. I advise you to return home early. Avoid suffering here. Miss, listen. Two tears thick. I'll crash to death and return. Lest others say east to west. They are in trouble. Here comes. The old fisherman who sent charcoal in the snow. Act as a matchmaker to make a good match.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on "Battlefield Heroes" will be released at the Great Light soon</h3>
<p>During the prosperity of silent films, Paramount Pictures once produced a war romance epic called "The World Flows", which is still praised by the world today. In view of the great success of "The World Flows", the company began preparing to produce "Battlefield Heroes" (ie Martyr's Blood) The Lives of Bengal Lancer four years ago. The script was adapted from the famous novel by Freischesis Siblang, depicting a tragic and enthusiastic story.</p>
<p>Because the company produced this film, it specially dispatched personnel, led by Judd Sack, to India to conduct on-the-spot investigations and take location shots. It lasted for a long time and cost a lot of money. As a result, 200,000 feet of film was shot, but only a part of it was used as a background.</p>
<p>The film features magnificent palaces, mysterious and beautiful dances, fierce and tragic wars, tense plots, and realistic performances. Anyone who watches it will sigh that it is a unique masterpiece in the film industry.</p>
<p>The protagonists of this film are Jarley Cooper, Frei Xu Dong, Li Que Langwell, Kasdan Ting Sir, Obrey Smith, and Catherine Baek. This long-awaited masterpiece will be released at the Great Light soon. Please wait and see.</p>
