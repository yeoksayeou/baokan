<p>時評</p>
<h3>人民團體協助防遏走私之有效方法</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>吾人對於走私事件向以爲除政府積極講求防遏辦法以外人民亦應盡其責任以爲協助本報經濟專刊一七六期中曾痛切言之最近漏稅私貨有自南北漏稅口岸附近地帶而進擾上海及沿江市塲之趨勢危機所迫已引起本埠各同業公會之活動在言論方面如昨報所載馬寅初君之廣播講演更力主加强工商團體組織利用各種相互關係以防止走私是則人民團體恊助政府緝私一事在事實上與言論上均有相當之進展矣茲請進而言恊助之方法</p>
<p>一曰宜共求防止走私各法令發生實效政府於走私問題問進行外交之解决允置重於對奸商之法律制裁及稽核統制兩月來公布「稽究進口貨物運銷暫行章程」及「防止路運走私辦法施行細則」修正「懲治漏私條例」皆所以阻私貨之販運保隙正當之營業者也在稽查進口貨物運銷章程中明定各地同業公會或商會稽查貨物運銷之權力巳使人民團體協助緝私獲有法律之根據日來本埠糖業公會之懸賞徵求報吿私貨轉運公會之通吿拒運無照洋貨及綢業公會等之活動其足以增進緝私之效力固不待言倘各業公會及各人民團體能依法繼起則奸商知恐懼私貨無銷路走私之遏止實效可見矣</p>
<p>二曰發揮組織力監視奸商及貪小利者吾人曾謂「假使無奸商私貨卽無從出銷有私貨而不顧奸商亦無能爲力」至如何使國內無奸商如何使有私貨而貪小利者不敢顧則有待於大衆之監視大眾勢散而無力更有藉於現存人民團體發揮其組織力量在目前空氣中販售私貨之爲違犯國法購用私貨之不齒於社會已造成一種公論故人民團體之監視奸商與貪小利者償可以法律道德爲工具助政府法令之施行勉同羣以母隳人類德性則走私者縱有護符無所藉口其能奈我何</p>
<p>私貨猖獗不僅影響關稅收入已成中國工商業之重大問題走私之防北關係複雜本非施用一種方法所能有效近來政府旣盡其力以遏阻走私人民團體自應爲國民經濟關係起而協助政府共去內在之障礙庶國外之營此不正事業者因無所憑藉無可圖利知難而退外交之解决亦有可言矣</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>重農歟？重工（上）　曾迪光</p>
<p>國家之經濟基礎，不外農工商三者，惟此三者之緩急先後，則不能不將一國所處之環境與時代，先行付諸考慮，方能有正確之立論。</p>
<p>溯自哥倫布發現新大陸（一四九二年）以後，西毆各先進國家，咸因海外貿易獲得巨大利益，於是羣起開拓殖民地，唯恐落他人之後，其時西毆各國人士，殆皆迷信立國應以商業為本：重商主義遂應時代潮流而產生。</p>
<p>重商主義之主要觀念，歸納言之，雖可分為左述三端：</p>
<p>（一）為力謀國外貨幣之流入；</p>
<p>（二）為力謀保持國外貿易之順勢；</p>
<p>（三）為設法提高國內生產力。</p>
<p>然國外貿易本為吸收外國貨幣之最重方法，而工業則為商業之前軀，故此三種中心觀念，實有非常密切之關係。重商主義之主要目的，旣為力謀保持國外貿易之順勢——輸出超過輸入——以期國外貨幣流入本國；故為貫澈此種目的計，政府務必一方鼓勵國內工業之振興，藉以增加出口額；他方務必於可能範圍內，阻止外國商品之流入。</p>
<p>吾人若以今日眼光，研究重商主義之基本觀念，則不難洞悉其錯誤之所在。蓋貨幣之重要機能，除為交換媒介外，復為價值之尺度，故貨幣數量與商品之價值，不獨有異常密切之關係，且彼此恰成一反比例。設有一國求欲增加出口減少進口，藉以吸收國外貨幣，究有何種結果，？貨幣數量學說曾明示吾人增加國內之貨幣數量，必使國內商品之價格提高，其結果則使輸出減少而輸入增加，貨幣復源源流出，故企圖藉賴國外貿易之差額吸收國外貨幣，實無異痴人說夢。況貿易差額與支付差額，性質上亦有所不同，所謂貿易差額者，乃指商品輸出輸入之差額而；所謂支付差額者，則不僅指商品輸出入之差額，且包括各種投資遠本付利之差額，國際間資本出入之差額，各種匯欵之差額，各種勞役酬報之差額，賠欵之支付，以及獎金之贈與等等而言。故貿易差額為負者，其支付差額或為盈，如戰前之英，德，法，三國是；貿易差額為盈者，其支付差額或為負，如戰前之美國是。由是可知，欲合賴國際貿易力量以求一國之富庶，事實上殊不可能。</p>
<p>復次，重商主義信徒，雖曾企圖設法提高國內生產力，然彼等之目的，旣在力求商業利潤，故彼等對於工業，乃視為吸收國外貨幣與夫保持貿易差額之手段，未免倒果為因，故十六七世紀時執國際貿易牛耳之國家如西班牙，葡萄牙，與以工業為基礎之英法競爭，立卽失敗，實因未將國內工業基礎，努力鞏固之故也。</p>
<p>自重商主義之勢力衰敗以後，重農學派之勢力，乃繼之而統制西歐經濟思想界。重農學派之主要觀念，簡而言之，亦可歸納為左述三端：</p>
<p>（一）主張政府對於國民之經濟活動，務宜採取放任政策；</p>
<p>（二）以為一切事業皆係不生產的，唯有農業能有凈生產；</p>
<p>（三）主張廢除一切租稅，僅向農業課賦單一稅。</p>
<p>此種理論，若以今日眼光觀之，亦有不妥之處。蓋政府對於國民之經濟活動，若完全採用放任政策，只求保護人民生命財產之安全，甚屬危險。若認農民為唯一之生產者，工商皆為遊食之民，則與理相悖。蓋所謂生產也者，乃指增加財貨之效用而言；農民出貨於地，使其供人使用而獲得效用，工人改變財貨之形式，使其愈能適合人類之需要，商人變動財貨之位置，以此地之所餘補他地之不足，其工作皆在增加財富之效用。故農工商三界，同為生產者，自屬不成問題，而單一稅之論據，亦不攻自破矣。</p>
<p>明乎往昔重農商派之理論，吾人乃可參酌我國所處之環境與時代，進而討論欲求改造我國，應以何者為經濟之重心。</p>

<p>（東京）以社會黨首領萊翁白倫爲首班之法國左翼內閣一旦成立、必强化法蘇提携進、而影響於蘇聯之東亞政策、故外務當局對該內閣今後之政策、與以深甚之注意、茲綜合外務當局之觀察如下、　左翼內閣出現之根本理由、係反映對德安全保障之强化及排斥國社黨之國民的要求者、爲對德安全保障强化之故、雖要求國聯之改組强化、然不能急速實現、故必强化法蘇提携、阻止德國之威脅、　對日關係直接的雖無變化、然若强化親蘇政策、必誘致蘇聯强化東亞政策、故其影饗未可蔑視、（五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>德陸軍要人　將奉派來遠東</h3>

<h3>英俄海軍談判</h3>
<p>蘇聯堅持原來主張　英波談話順利進行</p>
<p>（倫敦）英俄兩國海軍談話、本日在外務部賡續進行、雙方意見仍有參差、蓋英國主張英俄兩國未來海約所可規定之限制辦法、旣適用用波羅的海、亦應適用於遠東方面、此在蘇聯則仍堅持原來主張、以爲日本若一日不受同樣限制辦法之的束、則英俄未來海約卽僅適用於歐洲方面、此際談話進行趨勢、蘇聯主張似佔上風、將來解决途徑似當以此爲根據云、另一方面英國與波蘭問海軍談話亦在賡續進行中、不日可吿成功（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英俄兩國對近今倫敦成立海軍條的原則所作非正式之談話、因英國不能接受俄國所提出其遠東艦隊不在談話範圍內之保留、遂發生頓挫而停止會談、俾雙方代表各商諸共本國政府已閱十日、今日雙方復會談於英外交部、而討論雙方質的限制條的之全部範圍、聞已獲有滿意之進步、談話並不涉及量的限制、談話之唯一目的、乃在以倫敦海軍條的質的限制與預先交換造艦程序之條文併成英俄間之雙方協定、質的限制之運用、當然將視日本之態度而定、亦猶倫敦條的之本身須視日本造艦程序而發生效力也、同時英國海軍界希望俄國所提及不將其遠東艦隊列入此决談話範圍之保留、終能撤回、蓋英國如接受俄國之保留、則人將認爲英國許俄艦隊在遠東海而自由行動、此種印象爲英國所切欲避免者也、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>新總理白倫略歷</h3>
<p>（巴黎）國務總理萊翁白倫、生於巴黎、現年五十四歲、茲誌其略歷於决、一八九〇年畢業於高等師範學校文科、一八九五年考入平政院、賡續供職至二十四年之久、直至一九一九年當選衆議員、始乃退職、</p>
<p>一八九九年加入社會主義各項團體、當時各該團體幷不統一、萊翁白倫乃於是年、與其同學友人組織社會主義統一會、幷追隨社會黨先進若萊斯、（若萊斯係於一九一四年德國對法宣戰時、被政敵所暗殺）努力於團結運動、經過六年奮鬥、始於一九〇五年組成社會黨幷發表「勞工與社會主義者歷屆大會史」一書膾炙人口一九〇四年襄助若萊斯創辦「人道報」一九〇六年拋棄社會黨鬥士生活而於公務之暇致力於文藝創作幷於歐戰爆發數年之前在「晨報」發表戲劇與文學之批評文字均已彙編成書、一九一四年大戰爆發、社會黨放棄原來主張、出面參加內閣、該黨黨員桑巴担任公共工程部長一席、乃挽萊翁白倫祖任機要處長、一九一九年十一月十六日當選爲衆議員、幷自彼時起担任社會黨國會黨團秘書、從事條文工作、幷不時在衆議院充任發言人一九二〇年社會黨全國代表大會、在都爾城開會時、極端派人士主張接受第三國際政綱、致與其他各黨員意見不合、乃脫黨而組織共產黨、萊翁白倫與其政友仍竭力維持社會黨原來組織、幷自是年起、改稱爲正統派社會黨、一九二一年任「人民報」總經理、該報卽成爲正統派社會黨機關報、</p>
<p>一九二八年衆議院改選萊翁白倫曾一度落選、但翌年四月、該院缺額議席、舉行補選時、重又重選、社會黨國會黨國、并推之爲黨團主席、自是厥後、每屆選舉、無不連任、</p>
<p>一九三六年、卽本年四月二十六日與五月三日、眾議院改選、社會黨、急進社會黨與共產黨三黨、係以人民陣綫共同政綱、出而競選、結果大獲勝利、社會黨乃一躍而爲第一黨、萊翁白倫亦卽依照慣例、出任國務總理、（哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德報評法政局</h3>
<p>（柏林）半官報「外交政治評論」對於法新政府之組織、謂「新法內閣之閣員多數誹議普恩賚所採政策、但住內閣中之著名閣員亦不少竭力主張實行訂立法蘇協定者、」德國對於法國新政府完全無不公允批評、因德國素來主張各國對於本國內政方針、當有自主之權、於是德國自身亦希望有對內政自主權不受外來干涉、以此觀之、則大衆陣錢之若干口號、於德絕無驚奇、倘此種口號祇行之於國內、該報末謂希望德法間有眞實諒解、並望新政府能在此方面努力成功（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>法工潮蔓延全國　具有革命性質</h3>

<h3>上海之五金業</h3>
<p>— 中國微信所主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之二十七）</p>
<p>近年以來，五令營業，雖受社會不鍛氣之影響，但較其他各業，則又良好。惟同業聞競爭頗烈，以致獲利亦校昔日為薄耳。</p>
<p>至五金之製造廠家，在本市者，可分為製釘廠，鋼鐵廠，銅皮廠友五金零件廠三種，茲列述於次。</p>
<p>製釘廠上海之裂釘廠，共範圍較大者，為臨青路之公勤，檳椰路之王福，及福寧路之中國三廠，其他尚有小廠五六家。自華商製釘廠典辦後，外貨之元釘，遂漸告褻退矣。</p>
<p>鋼鐵廠上海之有製造鋼條，不過最近三年之事，而以新和興廠成立最早。誠廠係前和與廠之後身，設廠於清東，興業廠繼其後，於去年開設，廠址在平涼路，生產量視銷售情形而增減。</p>
<p>銅皮廠本市製造銅皮之廠家，計有岳州路之中國，　真人路之中華，寧武路之和興，　育會路之南　，及狄　威路之七星廠等，除中國廠羨裂銅絲外，錄皆專製銅皮。其中以中國銅廠成立較早，約在五六年前，其他各廠，係近四五年間成立。各廠所山之各秘銅皮，以銷售本摔各工廠多，外埠不居多。自有國產　供應市上後，外貨進口，即逐年減少。</p>
<p>五金零件廠所謂九金零件廠，範圍至廣，如刀。鋸。鎖。鉸。鏈，自來水用之凡爾等等，皆為其產呂，廠之規模，大多為小範圍，間有機器亦兼營製造。就中門鎖之製造，現今計有三家，即康元製罐廠之五金部，有金屬製品廠，及嘉定之合作五金公司是也。該三家均係仿製西式彈射門鎖，出口良好。銷行於本外埠，外貨方面，不免遭受打擊也。</p>
<p>最近國府實業部在北新涇設立中央機器廠，聞不久即可開工製造管子，鐵皮，銅鐵條等．範圍頗為廣大，他日正式出貨行銷，對於　平之舶來品必多一大抗衡力量也（完）</p>

<h3>敎師節與兒童節</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>轟轟烈烈的四月四日兒童節、過去未久、盛大的敎師節又來了、我們知道爲什麼要有兒童節呢、因爲這二十世紀是由女權運動而達到兒童權利擴張的世紀、愛倫凱女士簡直稱爲這是「兒童的世紀」、旣然這整個世紀是屬於兒童的、那末這整個世紀是改進兒童的生活、諜兒童的幸福、也就是這整個世紀、要推進兒童的事業「兒童年」「兒童節」這種種名詞、無非是重視兒童、鼓勵大家來提倡兒童事業、使個個兒童、將來都成爲好國民、强國家、</p>
<p>「兒童節」固然重要「敎師節」似乎更重要、因爲敎師是栽培敎育兒童的、他的一言一行、都能影響到兒童的將來慶祝敎師節、無非勉勵我們敎師更奮發更努力、怎樣做敎師、俞子夷先生說得好、做敎師第一要條梅花、梅是人天開得最早的花、可以代表一種「先見之明」的精神、第二要像冬青、冬青經冬不凋的、是常常青的、第三又要像老少年、就是說、做敎師的要有老成的見解、而具孩子的天眞、怎樣做敎師、像梅、像冬青、又像老少年、</p>

<p>全國兒童繪畫展覽會特刋</p>
<h3>藝術敎育之改進</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>—代發刋詞—</p>
<p>籌備半截出品數萬之全國兒童繪畫展覽會於今日舉國上下熱烈贊助聲中揭幕矣！集全國兒童美術作品於一堂，由全國藝術敎育專家作評判，此其意義，固不僅在展覽而已也。查閱展覽會之辦法大綱，開宗明義所昭吿於吾人者，其舉行展覽之目的，厥為藝術敎育的改進，則吾人於展覽之餘，應如何依據評判之結果，分別優劣之所在，硏究今後之改　，以完成展覽之使命耶？公展不敏，敢就管見所及，於敎育方面略抒所懷，藉以就正於賢達，</p>
<p>竊以藝術敎育之改進，厥為藝術與敎育打成一片，夫藝術敎育之目的，决不僅在技能之培養，而尤重於情感的陶冶，故敎學藝術者，除於藝術本身的技能而外，收效乃宏；反之，僅具敎育學識，而無藝術修養，結果之失敗，亦無　致，明乎此，吾人試再觀察今日藝術敎育之師資，能同具藝術修養與敎育學識者究有幾人？藝術學校僅知培養繪畫專家，師範學校僅知培養敎育人才，於是藝術師資，非有藝術修養而無敎育學識，即有敎育學識而無藝術修養，藝術與敎育，各不相謀，造成分離割裂之現象，於是所謂藝術乃無可避免失敗之厄境。今而後，果欲謀藝術敎育之改進者，則如何培養藝術與敎育打成一片之師資，實為首要之圖。竊以藝術學校之畢業生，如須擔任藝敎任務，則在校時必須灌輸敎育學識；師範學校之畢業生，如須担任藝敎任務，則在校時必須學習藝術技能，夫然後雙方兼顧，無所頗偏，藝術敎育之師資，始臻健全，藝術敎育之改進，方克有濟，甚望全國重視藝術敎育者，於此三致意焉。</p>
<h3>兒童與藝術</h3>
<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>天眞的兒童，好像潔白的絲；絲可以染成燦爛奪目的顏色，可以組織錦繡華麗的綢緞；這接收燦爛奪目的顏色，錦繡華麗組織，雖然是絲的本性，絲的個性；但是少不了人工支配。換言之，兒童可以養成民族的中堅，可以養成創造時代的國民，這民族的中堅，時代的國民，雖然是兒童的本能，兒童的個性，但是也少不了敎育的訓練。我們知道了這一點，那末，在兒童的本能和個性經過敎育訓練的過程中，就應當加以深切的注意。—因為白的絲可以染成紅的顏色，也可以染成黑的顏色，同時純潔的兒童可以養成創造時代的國民，也可以放浪成為民族的惡劣份子。</p>
<p>兒童受敎育的重要，旣如上述，而敎育的範圍很廣，方法很多，有的趨重於用腦，所謂智識敎育；有的趨重於勞動，所謂技能敎育；而這些智識與技能的敎育，均感枯燥乏味，均非兒童時期所需要與適合的敎育，兒童所適合與需要的，是手腦並用的趣味化的敎育；繪畫藝術，便是手腦並用，富於趣味的良好敎育。所以兒童施以藝術的敎學，目的不在造成藝術家，是對於全體的兒童，與以接近藝術的機會，培養他們美的興感，誘啓他們美的本能，樹良好的敎育基礎，養成創造時代的國民，使全體的兒童有　　美化的機會，欣賞宇宙間的美，得到美的陶鎔，而提高民族的品格，養成高尚和平的民族精神。</p>
<p>兒童和藝術的關係，前面大約的說了，現在則把藝術的旨趣，依據兒童的立場，加以述明。</p>
<p>自然界的一切　象，都含有美的成分，兒童有愛美的本能，對於美的東西，不期然而然的興起精神的活動表現，這种表現，就是兒童的趣味，兒童在接　美的景物而發生趣味的時候，他所有不愉快的情緒，都可以無形的消失，增起他欣賞美的趣味，使兒童懂得欣賞的方法，得到欣賞美的經騐，對於其他美的對象，隨在發生美的趣味，使兒童的趣味，逐漸的豐富，心情也逐漸的愉快，智體也因此而逐漸發達，達到他最圓滿的要求，這是藝術對於兒童趣味的涵養。</p>
<p>趣味的發生，雖由於美的引誘，而所以接受美的引誘，亦由兒童天賦的美感，美感的作用是由於人類的各器官接觸美的物件，領略到物件所含有的美點，心意上就發生了審美的活動，這所謂趣味，兒童旣有愛美的本能，當然有美感的興起，人類的感覺器官，是不進則退的，藝術就可以訓練兒童的感覺器官，鍜錬兒童的審美本能，同時兒童天賦的美感，因為時常接觸高尚的美的環境，也得潛移默化的純潔而高尚起來，不致於退化或腐化，這是藝術能陶冶兒童的美感。</p>
<p>人類的個性，也是天賦的特質，兒童的個性大都天眞爛漫，對於他自己的判斷，非常主觀的，他自己發表的製作，感覺到很豐富而滿足的趣味，這可貴的個性，就可利用藝術的機會來助長和發展他的優點，同時可以校正他的劣點，誘導兒童的個性入於正軌，以免放縱過度，難以改造，這是藝術可以發展兒童的個性。</p>
<p>人類對於固有的環境，總是感覺不滿足的，時時有改進的企圖，這種改進的作用，就是創造力，也是人類可貴的本能，在兒童時期，應當引起藝術製作的動機，使兒童自由發表自由創造，使兒童的創造本能，因此而特別的發展。上外還可以利用兒童欣賞藝術品的眼力；製作藝術品的手腕；硏究藝術品的腦力，使兒童的手，眼，腦三者同時間運用，平均的發展。</p>
<p>我們明瞭藝術與兒童的密切關係，我們承認兒童時期，為人生最重要，最有期望的時期，在這時期之中，應當施以良好的敎育基礎，其方法雖很多，要以藝術的感化力量為最深，所以潔白如絲的兒童，我們可以利用藝術的作用來敎育訓練，造成民族的中堅，養成時代的國民。</p>

<h3>全國兒童繪畫展覽會籌備經過</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>全國兒童繪畫展覽會在中國，尚是初次的創舉，經過了將近五個月的籌備，在今日舉國上下，萬方矚目中開幕了。這五個月里頭的籌備經過，是値得向全國人士作一個報吿的。</p>
<p>舉辦這個展覽會的主旨，是硏究幷提倡兒童繪畫，啟發兒童創造力，幷謀藝術敎育之改進。</p>
<p>發起舉辦這個展覽會的是全國兒童年實施委員會，因為舉行的地點在上海，所以又委託上海市敎育局中華慈幼恊會中華藝術敎育社上海市兒童實施委員會和上海市兒童幸福委員等會負責籌備，即由各該機關社團自行派選代表為籌備委員，組織籌備會主持進行。</p>
<p>籌備會於本年一月二十日組織成立，同日舉行第一次會議，分配各項職務，開始規劃會務進行。最初的工作，是從事各種法規章　的釐訂，因為這是會務進行的依據，所訂的章則，除全國兒童年實施委員會訂發的辦法大綱以外，尚有徵品細則，徵品要點，評判委員會簡則，出品審査標準，出品評判標準，繪畫表演辦法，出品獎勵辦法，徵集獎品辦法，徵集畫家作品辦法，徵集藝敎論著辦法，出品審査辦法，出品陳列辦法，來賓參觀須知，繪畫表演評獎辦法等等十餘種，均經籌備會先後通過</p>
<p>各種法規章則訂定以後，一方面隨時公布，一方面呈請敎方育部通飭各省市遵照，同時便開始徵集出品，計自二月十日起至五月十日截止，共收到二十餘省市之出品近五萬件，琳琅滿目，美不勝收，這是使我們十分慶幸的。</p>
<p>除了徵集兒童的作品是徵集的主体以外，為了充分發揮展覽的意義起見，我們又向全國藝術家徵集作品，敎育家徵集論著。徵集藝術家作品的目的，是供給兒童欣賞觀摩，以引起其興趣。徵集敎育家論著的目的，是搜集各方意見，供全國人士的硏究，謀藝術敎育的改進</p>
<p>因為這樣，在這次展覽會塲裏，除了兒童的作品以外，還有畫家作品陳列室點綴在裏頭，這可以說是這次展覽會的新花樣之一。至於藝敎論著，因為參觀人在短短時間中决不能仔細閱讀，所以不再陳列，而直接發交各報作特刋材料，如果經費許可的話，當在事後　刋專書，以供全國人士的硏討。</p>
<p>此外，我們為觀察外籍兒童的作風起見，又向上海各外人設立的學校徵求作品，經工部局華人敎育處的恊助，居然也有不少國籍的兒童出品來參加，於是我們又另闢外籍兒童出品陳列室，供參觀者的參攷，這也是這次展覽會的又一花樣。</p>
<p>然而，花樣還不止此，我們為了攷察兒童對客揮毫的能力起見，在展覽期內，又舉行兒童繪畫表演，事前訂定辦法，徵求兒童參加，共有一百六十餘人，僻處邊疆的察哈爾，亦不遠千里而來，這該使我們何等的慶幸呢！</p>
<p>我們綜觀這一次展覽會的成功，實在是羣策羣力的結果，雖然成績不一定盡如人意，然而政府的提倡，社會的贊助，都足以使我們感奮，隻可惜同人等力有未逮，尚難辦理欠善的地方，這惟有說句老話，請大家原諒了。</p>
<h3>兒童畫之眞諦</h3>
<p>— 兪寄凡</p>
<p>兒童畫，亦可說是自由畫，像模寫範本等毫無創作意味的繪畫，决非是兒童畫。是靠託兒童本身的力量，寫出浮於兒童本身之心中者，或兒童本身所看見者，纔得說是兒童畫。此種繪畫，當然具有創作的意味，並能滿足兒童之美的衝動。</p>
<p>要知道，惟有能滿足本身之美的衝動的繪圖，纔得具有創造性，纔得有主觀的大歡喜，纔得成為美的藝術。所謂美」，全在能徹底的滿足本人之衝動，其他則無從求其標準。而兒童所描寫的繪圖，若依原理說，無非是某種衝動的表現。例如因為心中有想獲得枇杷之衝動或欲望，於是就在紙面或牆壁等處，描寫枇杷。然「食」的衝動之欲望，决不限於枇杷，因此有時更描寫至別動果實。而在描寫時候，祗把滿足「食」的衝動為主眼，絕對不被畫面的形式（色彩，構圖等）所束縛。換言之，成人在描寫時所遵守的法則，在兒童是絕對想不到的。</p>
<p>藝術敎育之主旨，卽在使兒童之自我表現。尚　　展，祗得有滿足衝動方面求取。並須使其滿足能徹底，所謂徹底，即是各自主觀之一切的滿足。</p>
<p>小學一年級兒童們所描寫衷心得滿足的繪圖，在成人看來，雖不覺得有甚趣味，然從兒童的立塲言，確可說是具有獨創意味之美的藝術。所以兒童的繪圖，决不能依成人的標準來評判，而兒童在描寫繪圖時，更非敎師所得指導。</p>
<p>雖說不得指導，亦非完全放任，在兒童描寫繪圖時，敎師們應有適當的設計。而所謂設計，並非指導兒童（例如應該怎樣描寫，或不宜如此描寫等）是想法以使兒童的衝動得以徹底滿足，亦可說是鼓勵兒童滿足其本身之衝動，至於與兒童以忠吿，暗示，討論，參考等，亦斷難解决此問題，此問題，全仗兒童自己解决。</p>
<p>所以要把自由畫，當作兒童畫之中心者，意味即在處。最簡單的說來，繪畫敎育之基礎，應置於兒童的興味上，並須把兒童本身的描寫為其出發點。</p>
<p>在此次全國兒童畫展的審査期中，看到了各省的出品，眞得稱「兒童的繪畫」，並不多見，而最多者，或是借兒童的手筆，描寫敎師的造意，或由敎師模擬兒童的興味，修改畫面。為此寫這短文，希望敎師們先能明瞭兒童畫之眞諦，從事繪畫敎育，以謀兒童畫之向上發展。</p>

<h3>對於全國兒童畫展會的感想</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>全國兒童年實施委員會，及上海市敎育局等機關共同籌備的全國兒童繪畫展覽會，已於今天在上海市中心區開幕。籌備期間，塵被委為評判委之一，曾將各地學校所參加的出品檢閱一番。覺得在大體上，我國藝術敎育是有了顯著的進步。單是兒童繪畫一項，不論在內容方面，或是技術方面，雖不能件件合於徵品的宗旨及原　。但有不少的出品，依據兒童心理評判，確乎是具有創作性的。他們的描寫，固屬稚拙，却更流露出幽默輕快活潑單純的情調，而顯然與成年人的作品不同。他們雖摹倣，但並不是求其脫胎或酷肖，僅是藉摹倣為一種工具，以表達他們對事物的觀感而已。並且他們絕不受任何束縛，或嚴守成規，所以描出的畫幅，祇求意達而不在形似，成為一種畸形的東西，反在在表現出他們自由獨特的個性，我們如將這自由獨特的個性。給以良好有效的訓練，不難充分發展偉大的天才。所謂良好有效的訓練，就是藝術的敎育。所以這次全國兒童畫展的要旨，最後一條是改進藝術敎育，於此可見藝術敎育的重要。値此國運危急之際，藝術敎育更須特別注意　重視。譬如戰爭一事，實為人類史上不可避免的事實，關係國家的存亡至大，全國民衆均不應忽視。可是事實上，一般成年人還在做迷夢，對於戰事絕無感覺，反而在兒童未泯的天眞中，為愛國心所驅使，把軍事上的用件，例如飛機戰艦，機關槍，大刀等等……當做無上的好題材。他們的識辨，有時竟比大人更充分，並且十幅戰事　如有國際關係，他們的畫境，完全是我勝人敗，我存仇亡，這是多麽可貴而値得注意的一件事。一個民族的復興，種種物質方面建設之重要，當然無庸置議，可是這种精神上，心理上的建設，是先决的問題，萬不可不注意。把這種愛國的熱忱，加以培養，使其充分的發展，國家因之强盛，民族因之復興，那末不但是畫展最後的目的達到了，就是繪畫的一部份目的和使命也就在此了。</p>

<h3>日意人造絲杭帮採辦獨健</h3>
<p>邇來人造絲市價日漲、而綢價並不稍升、故綢廠進胃殊弱、惟杭帮交易獨秀、昨又向日意洋行購進一百二十號金魚牌五箱、價三百七十五元、一百二十號三號、司尼挨有光棧單、三百四十四箱、價九十元、不連稅、私貨存底甚少、但已無市面、現華北私貨、走銷非常困難、故價格再行下降、天津一百二十號天橋牌、為一百七十一元、一說已跌至一百四十元、周村二百四十餘元、高陽二百二十元、</p>

<h3>糧食　抵空復起　麵粉初跌繼回頭　最後反比上日好起一二分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初則平軟、下午反呈堅漲之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大雨處、、均回漲三四角左右、開價時、以洋麥雖報好、而日來天時　覺良好、因此人心見平、各月份較之前日、計落一分左右、惟交易沉寂、上落亦微、迨至下午開盤、一部分空頭、因時局謠言不息、近期復有多頭之　住、因此起而抵補、少數之廠家籌碼、亦聞陸續抵回、是以人心突轉激昂、較上午反漲三分左右、較前日則好一二分不等、觀目下情形、就天時及本年麥產而言、未看俏利、但外來之打擊、頗可憂慮、故前途暫難鬆動云、</p>
<h3>南京新麥聞已售開　－價三元八角－　標準午後為粉市帶起</h3>
<p>昨日期麥、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋無神之象、因洋麥雖報好三四角、惟天時晴暢可喜、故雙方賣買觀望居多、各盤交易旣少、出入亦殊無幾、這至下午開盤、初仍平平、後因粉市見俏、各月份遂亦帶起三四分、人心亦頗堅勁、至本年小麥、聞南京新麥已有售開、價三元八角、無錫蘇州幾處、不久亦將見樣開價、照業中人推測、一至湧檔、如無意外變化、尚看平落、否則當以粉銷為轉移云、</p>
<h3>食米市况益形疲落</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、仍有二十餘號、公貨共六千餘石、本街銷路、依然平常、惟包胃北洋帮動辦高料薄稻及厚粳各千餘包、故市况　疲、厚早粳價跌落一角、薄稻除高料勉定外、中市貨悉短角外、杜洋尖亦現疲勢、陰變元貶下近角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源見旺、約四十餘號、客方因天時漸熱、欲求脫售、而受主則僅就鮮艷價廉者略徵動辦、致市價白粳又小一角左右、薄稻小去數分、陰變元小角許、羊埠客尖零胃呆滯不堪、價修去六七分、其餘各貨、亦見疲小、</p>
<h3>閩帮停辦客秈續跌</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况又轉平軟無神、因閩帮運辦數天後、昨已停手、且其辦胃祗有一天暢旺、第二天以後、即無整票交易、人心乃逐漸軟化、昨日全市未有開手、即內地與泉州各戶亦多觀望、市上祗有本街趁小應酬、市面勢難站足、昨日高次各檔均見繼續平落數分、後市如本客仍無暢化、則市價或須再度趨軟也、全日聞出江西米一千一百八十七包、台米五百六十九包、江北米七百包、統為本街辦去云、</p>
<p>五月份糧價統計（續三日）</p>
<h3>南北貨　興花桂圓產價轉定</h3>
<p>興花桂圓、前以雜路貨步跌、兼之新圓均看豐收、故產價曾狂跌十餘元、如原貨四元至過六十餘元、並聞新圓已有拋價、極為廉宜、故人心更虛、但查　來申市雜路貨底存漸缺、價亦稍見回好、而興化新圓登塲須在八月中、為期尚遠、是以興化陳圓產價漸趨平定、惟此間各上牌興化正二以底價過高、去化極稀、市勢甚疲、無正式市價、後市尚恐下游云、</p>
<h3>五金　正副焊錫均無起色</h3>
<p>焊錫銷場以本街廠家為大宗、最近本街廠家大半减工停工、是以銷路亦因之大　、而天津復裝來雜錫不少、售價　更無起色、行情比之先　跌落二三元不等、如正號貨每担沽五十九元、副號沽五十四元、但亦祗有零星交易云、</p>
<h3>正號黑鐵皮勢將斷檔</h3>
<p>一尺六尺十八張正號黑鐵皮、最近市上現貨已有斷檔之勢、蓋到貨已吿絕跡、而底存亦寥寥無幾、故市上流通貨異常稀少、標準行情因之步步趨高、刻市每扎沽九元三四角、比前又高二角半之多、據大衆觀測、恐九元五六角行情、下星期中或有實現可能云、</p>

<h3>模範的新女性</h3>
<p>— 蘊琴</p>
<p>我所寫述的，並不是能同聶老太太，和黑衣宰相夫人纏奮，那樣齊名的入物，乃是我認為是我們現代婦女界中，不可多得的好模範。伊是我親戚的隣居，所以我詳細知道了伊的一切，我萬分的羨慕，和欽佩伊，而未得伊的許可，就寫了出來，請恕俄不能書明伊的姓名。</p>
<p>伊是受過高等教育的女子，在十年前，已結了婚，伊的丈夫，是狠精幹敏捷的，在大學畢業時候，就想出洋留學，因為經濟不裕，未能立時辦到，只好向社會中去謀衣食，他們早有了兒女，一切開支，是不能免的，但是伊能刻苦的自己操作着，一日間的事，眞似課程表一樣的做去，將節省下來的錢，積蓄起來，而要完成伊丈夫的志願。這個消息，被一位知己朋友知道了，自動的願意輔助他們，（聽說這位朋友，亦很節儉，確是他們的同志）於是伊的丈夫，就實行云遊學，現在已有二年了，伊在家裏，教育着三個兒女，雖然不用傭人，而小孩子的整潔，實在比人家有婢僕的，還要勝過幾倍，對於子女，處處能合乎家庭教育，去誘導他們，伊並且很有醫學上的常識，保護着子女的康健，個個都是活潑而健美的，生活在這種環攬中的小兒女，是何等幸運呢！伊很想待丈夫學成歸國之後，再繼續求學，古諺云「有志竟成」，是不難達到目的的。</p>
<p>我國的婦女，倘能個個如此，埋頭苦幹，造成完善的家庭，有了完善的家庭，始能有强盛的國家，二萬萬女同胞們，當此國難臨頭的時候，我們要快快起來，盡一份子責任，切莫落在人後呀！</p>
<h3>小家庭和節育</h3>
<p>— 美眞</p>
<p>這的確是一個重大的問題。當然囉，中等以上家庭中婦却不必斤斤計较於「節育」。因為伊們可以僱用奶媽哺嬰，大的孩子可以呌阿媽照顧，自己可以一點不必操心。</p>
<p>所謂小家庭，兩人全要致力於生產運動的，甚或不然，男的在外做事，女的在家中燒飯，整理房間……等。這種家庭在現社會中，不計其數。有一個小孩子却還不要緊，正可增進家庭的樂趣。但，孩子多了怎樣呢：女的一方面當然忙的不亦樂乎，對於教養方面就比較差點，而男的由公事房拖著疲倦的身體回來，正需要在恬靜的家庭裏，得到些安慰。孩子多，鬧的不亦樂乎，大人們間接受的影響也不少，足以防害家庭的樂趣。筆者有一打以上的朋友，差不多全是一年生一個，旣感身體的難以恢復康健，又不勝小孩的麻煩，夫婦們全感到莫大的痛苦。</p>
<p>「節育」便成了一般人所希望，只是不得其奧妙，只有望洋興嘆了。甚望婦女專刋可以請一可靠的醫生，按期披露關於節育的智識，不重空說，只重實際。更望同胞姊妹有得諸節育之妙方者，公開討論，以使向隅者，得到光明。</p>
<p>當然，「節育」是整個社會問題，在中國，處處落後的社會裏，也只有我婦女界一同云研討了。</p>
<h3>怎樣哺乳嬰兒？</h3>
<p>— 嚴芝</p>
<p>對於哺乳嬰兒問題，先得詳細研究一下母乳，因為母乳所含的成分，最適合於嬰兒的消化，無過厚和積滯之患，世間沒有比母乳更精美健康。然而，每因意外，嬰兒不能獲得這天然的食，於是不得不另覓他種食物來替代。</p>
<p>有許多婦人，用牛乳來哺嬰見，這很不妥的。稍有經騐的母親與護士們，皆知道嬰兒單食牛乳，不能生長，我們不妨將牛乳和人乳比較一下，就可明瞭了。</p>
<p>甲·人乳呈中性反應，牛乳僅呈酸性。</p>
<p>乙·人乳不含細菌，半乳含無數細菌。</p>
<p>丙·人乳的成分，若以百分比計算，含有脂肪三·三·蛋白質〇·七·乾酪素〇·八·乳糖七·〇·而牛乳含脂肪三·五·蛋白質〇·七·乾酪素二·八·乳糖五·〇。</p>
<p>無疑的，人乳與牛乳的差異甚遠，普通把牛乳用稀水調和，以哺嬰兒，這委實不能作為生理上正當的嬰兒食品。</p>
<p>其次，有用煉乳來代牛乳，普通的有三種。</p>
<p>甲·含有乳酪而加糖質者。</p>
<p>乙·含有乳酪而未加糖質者。</p>
<p>丙·乳酪已除去者，究竟其成分亦好像牛乳一般，並且沒有一種可稱完全適當的食品，以飼養六個月以下的嬰兒，至以六個月以上，應首先二種可做嬰兒一部份的食品。（乳酪撇去的，仍不適宜）。</p>
<p>還有飼育嬰兒常用奶糕，那裏知道六個月以下的嬰兒，實不易消化粉食，若勉强哺乳，很易致疾。據醫家的實馳上的證明，七個月以後的嬰兒，始可用粉食飼養。</p>
<p>賢慧的母親們，哺乳嬰兒是一件不可忽視的工作，因為嬰兒的健康與否，全視乎你們的注意哺乳呵。</p>
<h3>日本的標準結婚</h3>
<p>— 一髪</p>
<p>我國自實行集團結婚以來，不但全國風行。各國報紙，亦莫不引為美談。自從上海集團結婚的照片，在日本報紙上登載之後。素來勤儉的日本人，對此大為讚美。最近日本生活改善中央會製定了標準結婚式，不久也可風行起來了。</p>
<p>日本的結婚式，禮節繁重，金錢的耗費，不亞於我國的舊式結婚。從前日本有一句俗語，「有了三個女，便家產蕩然，」可見其糜費之大了。他們也都抱看這是女兒一生一度的大典，非全力使伊光榮一次不可的舊觀念。因此每年有二千圓左右的收入，為了婚嫁的耗費，常至負債。我國現在大聲疾呼的說着國難時期，日本便定為非常時期，警惕自己。這標準結婚，便又是日本非常時的結婚，所以用意又更進了一層。</p>
<p>據他們規定，日本每年能收入千五百圓至二千圓的家庭，在全國中可以佔十分之七八。這種家庭的婚姻費用，只能支出全年收入的三成。也就是以三百元左右為標準結婚費。結婚時最耗費的是衣服裝飾，約佔十分之七。其餘三成是儀式應酬及一切雜費。生活改善會曾向百貨公司調查最合宜的奩物，自衣服被褥鞋襪起至衣櫥鏡台，約二百二十元，計僅二十餘件。原來日本的結姻禮物，也非實用品。並且主家領了人家的禮物之後，仍舊要相當的回禮。現在標準結婚，便斷然取銷了回禮的舊習慣。</p>
<p>日本家屋狹小，大都借菜館禮堂旅館及神社去舉行神前結婚，或是佛前結婚，耗費較大。於是標準結婚以在新郎自宅結婚為絕對條件。新夫婦在家內佛台前及祖先神位前舉行婚禮，認為最有意味。招待的客人以三十入為限，男宅二十人，女宅十人。男宅的賓客是近親，朋友，及同事。女宅方面除親友外還有學校裏的教師。欵待賓客的酒席，每入約合三元五角，如是新婦方面負担了三十多元的酒席費之外，尙有五十元的化妝費車費及一切雜費。在日本的婚姻中，新郎方面，只有欵待親友的酒席費及儀式費而已。比女子方面，負担要輕得多，所以他們的標準結婚，是以女子方面為例的。</p>
<p>婚姻儀式的改良，以嚴重而少耗費為目的，男子方面讚同的較多，而女子方面，大都尙不能有澈底的認識。卽如我國的集團結婚，尙不能達到理想的流行，雖有複雜的原因，但事實上以女子方面反對而不能加入的並不是少。所以中日兩國的兩種新式結婚，那一種能通行，或者便可表示那一國的女性有自新的勇氣。</p>
<h3>女性論</h3>
<p>— 王嗣英</p>
<p>詩人密爾頓稱女性為「神的最後傑作」。黑格兒則讚美做「萬有之冠」。又多媚兒曾唱過「女性是萬有的花香」；拉瑪琴却名之曰「地上的天使！」</p>
<p>女性是能够表示人格的價值的最高美的最大的可能性的靈器。古希臘人說女性是禮拜神的宮殿，就因為女性是純粹的淸純馥郁的香，完全高絕塵俗而且包括一切塵界之香！因而發揚女性美，便是發揚神的美；同時也是發揚男性的美。這樣看來。如果沒有女性的地方，便沒有了男性的道德！</p>
<p>古今來有許多詩人差不多都認為女人是神將他最愛的天使使作他的化身。女人在世界上，是生活的光。有女性的地方，才照着溫馨和煦的光，才有着甜快明朗的快樂，女性就是天地間唯一的芳香！</p>
<p>文人的作品裏，幾乎全部在寫女性美；否則也是有關愛情的故事。德大詩人歌德不僅活在女性中間，而且會為綠蒂的緣故寫下了風行全世界的「少年維特之煩惱」。劇聖莎翁也是一半寫女性的劇本多：「羅密歐與朱麗葉」豈不是一個例子？</p>
<p>倘我們大膽地說一句：世界是女性的世界，怕也很少有人來反對吧？事覽是最雄辯：大思想家馬克思在戀愛的時候，日夜思慕的燕妮：吃巴黎的菜也不香了，看雄偉的山也不高了。好像在巴黎大學都懶於上課！如果不是後來「有情人終成眷屬」，那一部「資本論」就不能脫稿，也未可知！再看羅馬大將愷撒被米迷於Cleopatra的期間，兵收功去，曾不灰必；仍然貪戀彼女之豐腴肉體，叱咜風雲，「力拔山兮氣蓋世」的楚覇王你總該知道吧！在烏江自刎之前，還和虞姬飲酒舞劍，才死去的！若說：「女人是禍水」是表示女人的偉大；那一笑傾城，再笑傾國也絕非侮辱女性的話，我們看歷史上周幽王為　姒之一笑，不惜舉烽火以戲諸候。西施的撒嬌，夫差的心兒不知飄到耶裏去了。不全是說女人者轟風雲於大陸，改變乾坤的魄力麼？不過女人所用的武器，不是什麼三寸不爛之舌，宣傳什麼主義，什麼學會……而是軟化，性風政策罷了。</p>
<p>我常聽着一些人罵女性是幾個錢一斤？這是根本的錯誤—女人的價值，你要知道：就是六大洲五大洋也換不了啊！</p>
<p>讀者諸君：以為何如？</p>
<h3>莫遷怒到孩子</h3>
<p>— 韻芳女士</p>
<p>教養兒童實在是件極難的事情，有許多孩子教養得不好，這完全是父母的過失；卽使小孩子的先天不足，身有缺陷，這也是父母的過失；但是一般父母並不事先研究，待小孩一有問題時，就把他做一個試騐品或犧牲品，怎不可惜呢？</p>
<p>現在我要報告的，就是大人遷怒於小孩的事：大凡是一個人，都是有喜怒哀樂的，有了喜怒哀樂，做父母的在家庭裏最容易遷怒到小孩身上去。在快樂的時候，對他的子女非常和善；在發怒的時候，就要遷怒於他的孩子。有一次我家後樓的夫婦口角了，（兩入都是智識階級）過後不到半小時，他們的孩子手裏捉了一隻螳螂很高興的帶跑帶跳的進來。這孩子平時非常好問，無論一事一物都需要他的母親回答，這一次又要問他的母親了。照例像這種好機會，儘可利用偶發事項和目前實物，指導一些關於螳鄉的常識；但他的母親正在發怒的時侯，就拿起了檯上未完成的鞋底，重重的打小孩子的臉，打得他大哭不止。當晚這孩子因受驚太甚而發大熱，不上二天，一命嗚呼了。事後我曾對他們解釋這件事，他們很是後悔；但已無補於事了。</p>
<p>像上述這種遷怒的事實，可以說沒有一個父母不犯這罪惡，小孩子沒有抵抗的能力，父母要在小孩子身上出氣是很容易的。你自己喜怒無常，小孩子却跟着你受晦氣，這是我們做父母的應當深以為戒的，尤希望我約姊妹們能特別的注意！</p>

<h3>現代婦女的使命</h3>
<p>— 張已立女士</p>
<p>現代婦女，負有提高我們自己地位的使命，我們應該用我們自己的力量，來開拓我們自己的前途，顯示我們婦女的特能，剷除社會上對於婦女們輕視的心理，所以我們婦女，應該注意下列的十要：</p>
<p>儀態要大方。　體格要鍜鍊。　學問要切實。　見識要深遠。　心地要光明。　頭腦要淸新。　思慮要周密。　行為要莊重。　衣着要樸素。　服務要敏捷。</p>
<p>同時我們婦女，應該注意下列的十不：</p>
<p>不買外國貨。　不做花瓶。　不慕虛榮·　不事修飾。　不自視太低。　不倚賴男子。　不膽怯怕羞。　不讓男子佔先。　不為社會環境所屈服。　不可把改造社會的責任完全推諉給男子。</p>
<h3>致留在日本奈良的汾姊　（續）</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>——第二封信——</p>
<p>汾！你瞧！這件事已演變到了這樣的地步，該用什麼方法云過制它不再繼續惡化呢？最難的是大姊自己還不願意離婚；伊卽使要提出訴訟，目的也只好「請求維持同居義務」。</p>
<p>這一類的事情我雖幸而還沒有親身經過呀，但耳朶月裏所聽到的，眼裏所見到的已着實不少；大致現代一般人對於「戀愛自由」的解釋還不曾認識淸楚，只知道推翻舊道德，不知自己成立一種新的道德，於是經薄事件便層出不窮了，而最多的便是已經自由戀愛成功，已經結婚的人重復又和別人戀愛。</p>
<p>那末將如何設法挽救呢？好在我目下　是一個「無業游民」，有的是時間；而且我始終相信凡　總有辦法，只要有時間去想，不管怎樣的難事，也未　想不出好的辦法來。因此我便根據了大姊所知道的一切，以及姊夫本人的環境，對方的地位等等，通盤　慮着。大姊是從小和你一樣的領教我的「鬼聰明」的，便像一個害着重病的病人向一位名醫求診似的靜悄悄地坐候着，希望我能够給伊一張，「藥到病除」的藥方。</p>
<p>開藥方原不是難事，但要對症却就不易，我替大姊籌慮了半天，一而再，再而三的想了四五條對策，可是不單大姊覺得沒用，連我自己也覺得太幼稚可笑，便一槪廢棄；到最後才給我想出了一個「釜底抽薪」的妙法。所謂「釜」，自然是指姊夫，而「薪」自然是那劉女士了。但如何抽法呢？說來倒是很滑稽而又很乾脆的。</p>
<p>昨天早上决定對策，下午即刻實行；凑那劉女士回家進膳的時候，我伴着大姊直截爽快的去見伊，先進去時當然不說眞姓名，後來坐定了才告訴伊。這一去眞是伊所萬萬料不到的，而且我已預先知照大姊，不准伊露出一絲半毫的吃醋面孔，我是越發的裝得笑容可掬，全不像是來　事的樣子；因此更使那劉女士感覺到非常的詫異和難受。</p>
<p>大姊先拿出當初姊夫寫給伊的「信誓旦旦」的情書若干封來授給劉女士看，問伊現在所收到的和這幾封有幾分相像？接着又問伊一個肯離掉了自己從前所追求的所戀愛的妻子而和另一個女人結婚的丈夫，是否靠得住？可能保定他將來一定不再重新來一套？</p>
<p>這兩點一提出，劉女士已羞愧得無可容身了；大姊後又更進一步的把姊夫的經濟狀况一古腦兒的說給伊聽，並用三張當票來做結果。於是劉女士便哭起來了。我和大姊去安慰伊，還說如其肯照，小玲的話，大姊願意自動奉護汾，你猜結果怎樣吧？姊夫是白得了一個薄倖的惡名，反失却了一個情人。大姊倒添一位閨友，今天還要帶小玲上劉家去吃飯咧！</p>
<p>我不敢自信為這個辦法必然百試百效，但可以說：至少要比「哭」「打」「罵」「上公堂」等等高明得多了！</p>
<p>你們夫婦和諧，自然不會有留着「參攷」的必要；只是「　關至戚」，理當「據實奉聞」。一笑。　　妹雪上</p>

<h3>馮文鳳女士論巾幗英豪</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>對秦良玉秋瑾宋慶齡深致敬佩　婦女能舍身救國必可解除國難</p>
<p>最近曾參觀兩次女子書畫展覽會，一是康同壁楊令　合組的，一是中國女子書畫會舉行的，我看了大為贊嘆，覺得她們精心習作，居然有如此美滿的成功。本來中國從前一般婦性，多是三步不出　門，終日在深閨裏做些女紅，便算了不得的工作；聞有些吟詩繪畫，也不過拿來自娛，不想給人家知道的。可是近二十年來，女學　盛，風氣轉變，而女子在社會的地位，也大不相同了。就拿女子研究藝術來說，數量固然增加，質量也大為精　，但都不想聯絡，門戶之見　深。自從三年前中國女子書畫會成立之後，綱羅國內女書畫家百餘人，聞誠合作，造成了一個空前的集團，倒是一椿很可喜的事呢。</p>
<p>此番展覽會中，有七十餘位女書畫家的作品，琳琅滿目，各有特色，例如馮文鳳女士的書法，蒼深樸　，雄奇古厚，沒有一些纖弱姿態，我因此便想訪問這位　女士，恰巧遇到陸了丹林，願親自紹介，於是兩人便向白　南路鄧齊進發。馮女士竭誠出迎，看她性情很是豪爽。丹林說：「馮女士是廣東鶴山人，她父親　韓先生，是粵省的金石名家，　　歷代碑帖極富，當她七八歲時，她父親便教她讀書，臨碑，繪畫，她有　藝術天才，好　不倦，下了幾年苦功，篆隸正草各體書法，都有想當成績。在十四歲那年，香港舉行售品賑災　，她被請當衆揮毫，寫些屏　扇　，賣到六百多金，時有神童之稱。翌日中山先生在總統府　軍十　勞會，她是一幅馬棚火災圖，賣了　四百元。近十年來參加了多次畫展，獲得中外獎章獎狀四十餘作，在華南女藝界她已有很好的地位。一個女子能得如此榮譽，自　偶然，她有　　譬如一日的勤學精神，不管　什麼，這　它不曾成功麼？</p>
<p>我問她在古今歷史中最佩服那幾位巾幗英豪？女士想了一想：「這話很難說，因為數千年來超羣卓越的女性，實在太少，有的也太偏於賢妻良母，對國家確是很少貢獻　。此刻我所能憶起的，如明末的秦良玉，文武兼全，　　多謀，當時外敵凌夷，她率兵禦寇，屢著戰功，像她這樣的人，正是現中國最需要的人才，希望我們女界，要學她的榜樣，大家有上前綫殺敵的勇氣，國難終有解除的一天。一位是秋　五烈士，她對中國文學有　　，她的國家觀念很深，能犧牲了一人，家一切的　　，而舍身為國，為女界歷史上平添一道光輝，值得我們效法的。　於　在，我對於款慶　女士的印象也很好，她有堅苦好學　　　不妥恊的精神，她有意志，有靈魂，有人格，不管她的政見如何，為人是有特長之處的。此外當然也有奇特的人才，可是待繼續的努力，天下後　，自有公論。</p>
<p>她主張女　塵研究藝術，旨趣比較近些，婦女要有團結合的精神。　市女性太　重享樂，沒有　實際工作。她自己每大早起七至九時，練習書畫，已二十年不　，還喜歡吟詩，攝影，綱球，游泳。這些事在個人方面講，的確有益而有趣，能做到的大槪　於中上階級的人，我很盼望中上的女子，無論在精神與物質方面，能多補助一般勞苦的婦女大衆，有飯大家吃，有福大家享，這豈不更好麼？</p>

<h3>百日咳</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>Pe　tussis</p>
<p>本症卽頓咳。又名痊咳。係傳染百日咳菌而起。六歲以內小兒最易罹之。輕症一日咳三至卅回。重症多至百回。有呈單純支氣管粘膜炎者。有合併卡他兒肺炎者。初期用鎭咳劑卽治。（一元）以後須用溴化鉀或菌液。（二元）</p>
<h3>精液Sperma</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾</p>
<p>精液為男性生殖液。射出時為濃黏稠性。作乳白色。有特臭。呈　性反應係睾丸等生殖腺之分泌物。內有多量之精虫。遊泳其間。係子嗣之泉源。一回之射精量約三至四公撮。一公撮中約有精虫六萬頭。</p>
<p>精液除為子嗣之泉源外。且髓腦亦全恃其營養。故凡患有精系病如遺精等症者。每兼訴有腦弱健忘。頭暈失眠之苦。對症發藥自以生殖腺內分泌製劑「生殖素」為最效。</p>
<p>惟遺精病源。更在輸精管之鬆弛。故「希米脫氏固精片」尤為重惡之主劑。此患者所不可不知也。</p>
<p>至於早洩腎痿衰弱等症。除「生殖素」為必不可少之內服劑外。如欲速求治愈。宜兼受無痛苦之電療。</p>
<h3>遠年胃痛（病理治法）</h3>
<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>胃痛一症。人每視為不治絕症。因而遷延失治。纏綿久年者。比比皆是。要知胃痛並不難治。祗以胃痛病源。不一而足。或緣胃酸過多。或基胃炎腫脹。或因胃壁剝蝕。或由胃筋拘　抽刺。更有因胃神經戟痛及幽門脹　作痛者。如用藥局限一隅。而不面面顧到。固屬無從治療。卽能用藥兼顧上述種種病源。幸吿治療。然以久病之胃。病根雖除。如不加以培補以壯健之。則仍非根治之道也。</p>
<p>患者周志雲。患胃痛垂十八年矣。藥來痛去。藥去痛來。困苦難堪。去冬由其至戚韋志成君介紹來診。余以「胃痛靈」能兼顧前述之種種之病源。而「健胃素」又為培補胃　之無上良劑。卽囑向太和藥房購取。依法餌服。連服四盒。胃痛卽去根。除胃　頓轉壯健。愈後輟藥停服。亦絕不再發云。</p>
<h3>神經衰弱症</h3>
<p>— 任國祥</p>
<p>世態演進。人事日趨煩劇。刺戟孔多。感慨萬端。於是神經衰弱。遂成為目今社會之通病。</p>
<p>神經衰弱。變症最多。輕重雖殊。其病源咸在生殖腺內分泌之缺乏或失常。治法自以內服「生殖素」為最對症。吾人曾用以救治衰弱患者。克奏最美滿之效果。</p>
<p>今春余曾用以治愈蔡長初君之發育不全。鮑傳耕君之未老先衰。朱雲厚君之貧血腎虧。並以（女用生殖素　治愈楊新民夫人之小產腹痛。為期均未逾一月云。</p>
<h3>骨痛肢麻治法一例</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵</p>
<p>骨節痠痛。非僅由於風濕內蘊。更有梅毒性與淋濁性之分。如投藥未能兼顧。則無從根治。故根治之法。自以去風濕及搜餘毒兼顧為上。否則病勢漸增。四肢麻木。半身不遂。動脈硬化。卒中猝倒。在在堪慮。</p>
<p>去秋有李佐卿君。來訴有骨節痠楚。手足麻木之苦。經余察得李君實因餘毒內蘊所致。卽囑向中西藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」。連服五盒。不惟毒除瘋去。且骨節輕鬆。筋絡舒暢。手足亦立轉靈活。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>
<h3>王士英醫師戒烟講座</h3>
<p>烟害流毒。垂九十年。弱國病民。拜賜實多。欲圖自强。自非先除烟毒不為功。此其所以政府嚴令禁烟。上下雷厲風行也。</p>
<p>吸烟末路已近。期限迫在眉睫。及此不戒。則大辟臨身。悔之晚矣。</p>
<p>戒烟問題旣為通國所急切注意。則醫師貢其經騐心得。亦天職所在也。因舉數例。俾資有志自　者。得所遵循云爾。</p>

<h3>慢性病之危險和治療</h3>
<p>— 徐中道</p>
<p>有一些普通醫學知識者，均知慢性淋病難治，但十有八九鮮知淋病轉入慢性之危險，故一般患者，設一旦已身淋病轉入慢性，均以急性之症候已過，從此便可太平無事，往往放任着不加醫治，因此鑄成急性再發，急性合併症，尿道狹窄症，及傳染妻子等危險，蓋尿道內有潛伏之淋醫，隨時有再發之可能，更能損害尿道及隨時作崇，侵及鄰近和遠隔之臟器，如發生急性睪丸炎，急性關節炎，心臟炎等之痛苦症狀，故對慢性淋病之治療，應更愼重，</p>
<p>慢性淋病之治法—淋病轉入慢性，應內服防腐利尿，制止淋菌發育，減少分泌，鎭痛收歛之內服藥劑，若淋病內服新藥「滅殺淋」Mesailn，據余臨床實騐，確頗有應效，一方面再施以電療，蓋淋菌長電熱，為世界醫者所公認，凡經四十二度之電力，淋菌即無生存之餘地，余凡遇久治不愈之慢性淋病，恒以內服「滅殺淋」Mesaln，外施短波透熱電氣療治，均能根治，屢試不爽，誠根治慢性淋病之最適療法也　（完）</p>
<h3>雀汗斑面瘰粉刺原因治療</h3>
<p>— 張桂祥</p>
<p>雀斑汗斑面瘰粉刺均係面聞之皮膚疾患，大致於青春發動期，因分泌機能亢進，皮脂積滯所致，或於神經血管障碍而起，均累累叢生於面頰鼻樑等處，雀斑汗斑多呈深黃褐色，狀如針頭，或如小豆，雖厚敷脂粉，亦能隱約可見，最可恨者，愈敷脂粉，而雀斑愈多，蓋因受脂粉中之鉛質毒，更引起雀斑繁增也，晚近雖多各種美容品在報紙中宣傳，能治雀斑，大致均係　質油性之雪花，或含有鉛質之蜰粉，敷之不但無效，反日見增多，因此受累者無數，據之央社二日南京電，衛生署以婦女化妝面粉，多含鉛質，經年餘精密化騐結果，含鉛質者百分之四十有奇，為害甚重，竟連暢銷全球之法國和貝甘香粉，亦含有鉛質百分之二五，九五·該署並撥有製粉新方，試騐滿意，正擬發行，蓋雀斑汗斑面瘰粉刺等，亦係皮膚疾患之一種，非敷脂粉搽雪花所能見效，必須以專治之一種，非敷脂粉搽雪花所能見效，必須以專治是項疾患之藥品，副以無　油質或鉛質之香精品配製，方能治療，聞最近有Beautyl「美麗」一種，應銷市上，專治雀斑面瘰粉刺等患，頗見功效，因「美麗」完全採專治雀斑改造皮膚糙粗之藥品，佐以精貴香品，依最新科學方法配合，對治雀斑汗斑粉刺面瘰等患，有不可思義之神效，誠現在青年患雀斑面瘰之好友也（完）</p>
<h3>胃病治療之重要</h3>
<p>— 馮賡財</p>
<p>我人之日常生活營養補給，必須賴胃之消化力旺盛，設一旦發生障礙，則百病因之而起，茍無特效藥以治聞，必日為病魔所纏擾，而永無健康之一日，甚至因營養不良，肌肉日見消瘦，精神萎靡，引起癆症，成不治之疾，據國內醫藥界統計，乃食物不潔，或飲食失和所致，對此種疾患治療，市上雖多成藥，但大致含有麻醉性之藥劑，服後祇能見效一時，對病者未能澈底根治，反能延成慢性，根治不易，晚近有「胃寶」發明，該藥無絲毫麻醉性藥品，含有功能調和益胃之生理機能，根治各種胃病，頗具功效，余累經臨床實騐，確見奇效，茲特述之報端，以介紹患胃病者也（完）</p>

<p>— 葉起明</p>
<p>神經的發育是靠着一種特殊的神經細胞之分裂，由於這種的分裂，那無數散佈於周身的神經織維才能伸長發展，大家想必都知道，我們身體內的神經可為兩大類，即中樞神經，（Cen-tral　Nervous　System）與末梢神經（Peripheral　Nerues）而前者又可分腦髓（Brain）與脊髓（Spinal　Cord）兩部份，牠們在青春期都表現量與質的發展和變化，就中尤以腦髓的發達關係青年生活極大，牠在青春期隨着其牠官能發達而發達，大概普通的人腦的中層部在十七八歲時，其神經細胞數已大增，即是神經的織維比以前逐漸增多，這種增加力一直可延長至三十餘歲，但要是在青春期營養不良，或不正當的行為（如手淫及過分縱慾等），使體內的性器官與生殖腺的分泌作用受着妨害，影響到全喬峰，因此神經織維的發達亦受阻礙，使無數天才的腦髓不能得到應當發育的程度，更因之而發生神經衰弱症，（如記憶減退，頭暈目眩，遺精早洩，性機能失常等症狀）故青春期如發生上例症狀，應即清心寡慾，改良日常環境生活，并內服燐質荷爾蒙製劑，若『安爾神』Arolsen藥片，使神經細胞更生活動力，生殖腺內泌作用復常，則青春期之神經織維再復增多，蓋神經織維發達，則智識亦同時發達，而青年的思想亦因之純正，辦事耐力亦能增強，事業就因之亢進，故神經系與整個人生關係甚是偉大，青年於青春期之神經發育和補助法，不可不注意。（完）</p>
<h3>皮膚病之完善治療</h3>
<p>— 范志成</p>
<p>皮膚病均係傳染所來，種類之多，筆難盡述，如各種風癬，疥瘡，脚濕，濕瘡等症，考其原因，乃毛狀菌所致，蓋我國地處溫帶，毛關菌繁殖特盛，尤於用南方一隅，患者特多，因其傳染性頗強，且極難根治，時發時愈，對於精神痛苦萬分，因其能阻碍神精細胞之機能，故德國於大戰後，知對皮膚病根治之重要，由大化學療病家毛更羅氏，悉心研究，發明皮膚病之特效方法，如最近發明專治皮膚病之敷劑『減絕菌』Misulzine，能深透皮膚內層，殺滅毛狀菌之特效藥，以及電療方面，有人工太陽燈，及柯羅梅亞燈之照射，均為現代皮膚病之完善治療物也。（完）</p>

<h3>且慢慶祝</h3>
<p>— 子彬</p>
<p>六六的敎師節又到了，本市的敎員們又在興高采烈的籌備種種節目，準備屆時熱烈慶祝一番，什麼遊藝節目呀，聚餐呀，都在分頭進行中。</p>
<p>坐了一年的冷板凳，難得有一天「敎師節」，來熱烈慶祝一下，那自然是頗為應當的。不過，在「多難」的現狀下，「敎師節」是否是聚聚餐，看看遊藝節目，或者聽聽名人演講就算了事呢？說起來是頗為掃興的，聚餐，遊藝節目之外，似乎總應該再做一點旁的事情，像平日應做的那樣的事情，雖然名義上是「敎師節」，那一天就也似乎應該熱烈慶祝一番。</p>
<p>不多幾天之前，某地小學敎員因為欠薪過多而自殺的新聞，好像剛巧有過；而和刊載籌備慶祝敎師節新聞的同日報紙上，松江的地方通訊便有「中小學敎員索薪」的新聞，這兩條新聞參照着來讀，多少總使人是感到有些刺激的。這還是敎員本身的事情。</p>
<p>此外，過去得不久的僞國改敎科書的事情，我想服務於敎育界的，有切身之痛的敎員們總也不見得會忘記，這樣嚴重的滅種的慘禍，敎員們在這個「敎師節」裏，便該痛定思痛的來有所表示。</p>
<p>除了農村破產，沒有機會受敎育的文盲且不去說它，就以現有的鄉村敎育來說，牠是一副怎樣破碎的局面？這在服務於敎育界的敎師們應該是最明白的，就以我們局外人從報紙上看來，已經不難想像出來。</p>
<p>或許說，這是鄉村間的事情，和我們都市的上海不關，那麼，我們就以上海來看，也儘有許多慘不忍睹的事情。</p>
<p>上海是有很多的所謂「弄堂小學」也者的，我有幾位朋友在這裏面擔任這「清高神聖」的事業，他們的待遇呢，說起來簡直難以使人相信，每天吃好幾個鐘頭的粉筆灰，而一個月的酬勞便祇有大洋十幾元，這十幾元的酬勞，有時候不湊巧，也時常欠上這麼二三個月。</p>
<p>這神聖的事業何以會弄成這樣凄慘的局面？這原因是不說也夠顯明的；在這樣的局面下，我們下一代的所謂「國家命脈」將會受到怎樣的「敎育」呢？想起來眞是使人不寒而慄，然而敵人却連這一些都不放鬆，他們一方面用種種手段來侵略，而在侵略所得的所謂「自治區」內，連這樣可憐相的「敎育」，還得把敎科書改成所謂「王道」，「忠君」的「奴隸敎育」。</p>
<p>在這樣嚴重的局勢下，貪得無厭的敵人得寸進尺的向我們進逼中，我們的敎師們祇想在「敎師節」那一天熱烈慶祝一番，未免有失「敎師節」的本意吧？想到都德「最後一課」中的老教師，我們眞有欲說無從之慨。</p>
<p>且慢慶祝！現在不是慶祝的時候！</p>
<h3>黃花篇</h3>
<p>— 梁啓筠</p>
<p>在焦灼的期待了差不多將近一個月，舅父底復信一來到，我幾乎像年老的慈母，看到了久別家鄉的兒子底歸來似的狂喜着。捧住它，興奮得連眼淚也流了出來。</p>
<p>我底舅父，陞和隆茶棧底管賬，矮胖個子，脚氣病患者，懂得錢是好東西的小商人。從外貌看上去好似有點狡猾的樣子，其實那脚色却是極其懦弱的。頭一天，他一瞧見我，劈頭就扯着我說，「哦，人長大了呢，該懂事些了，不要再像從前跳蝦那麼地跳來跳去。」他把我端詳了一會，又把說話繼續下去。「少泉，你表弟也不成材。雖然還聽我底話，但祇會用錢，却不會去賺。沒出息！……唔，還有你底表妹，一天到晚，滿嘴自由，自由，什麼新時代，什麼二十世紀，唉眞煩膩，那傢伙總有一天我趕她去做婊子的。羞家門啊，祖宗神主牌都睜大眼珠不安着呢……」</p>
<p>「那末，我底事情怎樣了？」除了關於我底生活問題之外的話，我都不要聽的。</p>
<p>「你——你，我已經為你在茶棧裏謀了一個管倉底助手的位置。」</p>
<p>「不壞吧——」</p>
<p>「十五塊錢月薪。我做了快十年了，也不過是三十五塊錢咧。」</p>
<p>我又失望，同時又似乎滿意。矛盾的意志時常在心裏搏戰着。人是在矛盾的氣圍裏邊活着的啊。……</p>
<p>轉眼間，春天一日一日的老了。季節開始蛻變啦。</p>
<p>每逢陽曆四月底至五月的時候，經過梅雨時節，朝一陣雨，暮一陣雨，雨停了，風溫和了。季節也就暖起來。可是，那年眞有點異樣，一塲一塲的雨是落了。天氣却還是老着臉皮，不肯稍動一下。</p>
<p>那天底黃昏，舅父不知在外面觸了什麼霉頭，一踏進門檻，就太息了一聲，便，</p>
<p>「唉，眞該死，天造孽哪！春行冬令，這都是那班摩登女帶累的啊。」</p>
<p>「不是呢，你不知道麼，往年我們底北方有很廣大的地方把寒風遮攔住。如今沒有了。北方底冷風，就一直吹到我們這裏了。」我說。</p>
<p>表妹用憂鬱的眼光掃了我一下。——她是懂得我底意思的。</p>
<p>一家人除開表妹外就沒有人可以談得來了。但，她也時常都避實就虛地和我說着非常牽強的話語。我是知道她底心事的。她愛過一個男人，那人據說也愛她。這，當然是舅父生平所反對的啦，不時都以不能入耳的難堪的言詞譏諷着她或者是咒罵她。她看來好似處之泰然的樣子。其實也是憤然極了的。不過為了未來底光明蠱惑了她，太多美麗的憧憬圍繞了她，她祇好暫時忍耐着。忍耐并不是很好壞的事。有誰敢說在冰雪重凝之下的火山沒有爆發的一天呢！可是，連這一點小得像星星一樣的冀望，都給剝蝕了。有一夜，表妹很晚纔回來。是舅父去開門的。他一眼瞧見那男人，就憤不自勝的說：</p>
<p>「要做就做到底，我把女兒交給你，假使我底女兒有什麼三四，一概惟你是問呀。」</p>
<p>說完，還要找那男人拚命。</p>
<p>那男人一溜烟跑了。以後在通過了一次們後就絕了踪跡。</p>
<p>而舅父為了這事，也和舅母吵了一次大大的架。值是希罕的，是舅母傃開通起來。她說「我們這一代完結了，下一代也應該讓他們過一些日子纔是」</p>
<p>舅父氣得翻白眼。連聲大呼「反了，反了。」我清晰地記得他曾經歇了一頓飯沒有喫。過後，又好像沒有這一回事似的談笑着。而表妹底不幸倒成為鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>她孤獨了，她寂寞了，沒有東西能給她以滿足的慰藉的。</p>
<p>也許就是為了那件事，她成天兒都憂鬱着吧。……</p>
<p>人們相處在一起，往往不會想起互助，祇是彼此的發現對方的缺點，因之彼此誰都輕視誰，攻許着，誹謗着。我在舅父家裏住慣了，基於雙方思想永不能融和，以及上面所說的「人之常情」之下，時常發生非惡意的口頭爭執是有的。</p>
<p>在我底記憶裏邊的某一晚，春底夜啊，柔和的空氣帶了點潮濕，窗外，纖纖的細雨正落着，落着。每在兩天，那蘊藏在心裏的憂鬱又在齧噬着我底稚弱的心了。——本來是很明快的雨點呀，怎么一下地也變得汚水了呢！</p>
<p>人靜了。祇剩舅父和我兩個。他埋頭在讀一折書「花月痕」。我，無聊地翻着當日報紙，他走了過來，挨近我，說道：</p>

<h3>The Situation in North China: Sideways Discussions in Tianjin, Centered on Tashiro and Nagami; Qi Xieyuan and Lu Zongyu Also Participate; Tianjin Authorities Confer on Maintaining Security</h3>
<p>Song Expresses Non-Acceptance of Conditions Involving Loss of Sovereignty and Territory</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4 p.m. on the 5th, there was a meeting at the Japanese residence in Zhang Garden, centered on Tashiro. Nagami, Ishii, Iida, Nakai, and other staff, along with Yin Rugeng, Qi Xieyuan, Shi Yousan, Ling Zongyu, and more than thirty others, held sideways discussions on the situation in North China. They dispersed at 6 p.m. Song Zheyuan has decided to use his strength to maintain security in North China, and will not accept any conditions involving loss of sovereignty or territory. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsumuro Teiichi will come to Tianjin on the 7th to visit Tashiro. On the 6th, he first sent Major Hamada to Tianjin by plane to report on the progress of diplomatic negotiations in Peiping. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major General Kuwaki of the Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters, accompanied by Major Kohira, head of the surveying team, arrived in Tianjin on the night of the 4th after speaking with military attachés Matsumuro and Imai in Peiping to conduct surveys. On the morning of the 5th, they accepted invitations from Tashiro and Nagami to attend a meeting at the Zhang Garden residence to discuss recent events in North China. They will transfer to Jinan and Qingdao on the 6th to conduct surveys. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major Kuwahara Araichiro, attached to the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Tianjin on the 5th to visit Tashiro. Tashiro met with Commander Ueda. Major Tsuruta, attached to the Japanese garrison in North China, left for Changchun on the 5th to take up a new post attached to the Kwantung Army. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4 p.m. on the 5th, Security Commander Liu Jialuan and Public Security Bureau Chief Sun Weidong summoned officers of the rank of company commander and above from the garrison troops in the suburban area, and officers of the rank of squadron leader and above from the police security teams, to a meeting at the Security Department to discuss methods for maintaining security inside and outside the city of Tianjin. Sun Weidong stated that Tianjin's security is absolutely not in danger and urged citizens to remain calm and carry on with their businesses, without alarm or anxiety. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song has ordered Liu Jialuan to concurrently serve as the director of the Wuhe Water Police Bureau, to command inside and outside of Tianjin. He took office on the 5th. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Xiao Zhenying came to Peiping today. The actions of Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, are very secretive. Well-informed Chinese sources claim that he has gone to Tokyo on an important mission, but the Japanese claim that Chen has gone to Guangzhou and will return to Peiping. This is currently a question mark. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Rumors have gradually subsided in recent days. The Peiping Public Security Bureau has secretly ordered the arrest of those spreading rumors. Japanese military attaché Imai denied the rumors and asked that the Japanese side maintain a consistent stance. The situation in the North remains the same, and there is absolutely no change in reality. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai Takeo said that recently there have been rampant rumors in Peiping and Tianjin, such as the deployment of Japanese troops to Nanyuan, the southward transfer of the 29th Army, and that the families of many important people have left Peiping and returned to their hometowns, all of which are unfounded rumors. Although the rumors have no basis, many people who do not understand the truth are confused, such as students opposing the southward transfer of the 29th Army and going on strike, which is one example. In the past two days, the rumors have gradually subsided, and people's hearts have also calmed down slightly. In short, the Japanese deployment of troops in North China is purely to protect Japanese residents, and its attitude towards North China remains the same as before and will never be easily changed. It is hoped that everyone will not worry. The incident of Japanese soldiers being shot and killed by British soldiers is still under negotiation. The truth about the bombing in Tianjin has not yet been determined and is currently under investigation. Commander Tashiro can come to Peiping after the 20th. I have not heard of General Matsumuro's recent return to his country. The reporter then asked about the recent reports in the Japanese press on the southwest, which are the opposite of what the Chinese press has received. Imai replied that he only saw the reports and did not know the actual situation. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Zizhong has been away from Peiping for a long time. Chahar Province's political affairs need to be handled. On the morning of the 5th, at 11:15, he took the Peiping-Suiyuan train back to Zhangjiakou. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shi Yousan Organizes Anti-Communist Army</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain party ordered Shi Yousan to organize an "Anti-Communist Army". Shi appointed Bai Jianwu as the commander of the First Army Corps and Wang Delu as the commander-in-chief. They are currently actively active in the Japanese Concession here. (5th, China United Press)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Paper Money Plummets</h3>
<p>Financial Panic Intensifies</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Financial panic here is becoming more and more intense. Today, 1,984 yuan of Guangdong paper money is required to exchange for 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. The public is selling Guangdong paper money in droves, and there are almost no buyers. The authorities have not yet announced measures to maintain the market. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Granted Three Months Leave</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Affairs Council decided at a meeting on the 5th to grant Zou Lu a three-month leave and allocate 50,000 yuan for travel expenses. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Zhao Daiwen Assumed the Position of Chairman of Shanxi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yan Changed the Appointment of Chen Cheng as the Oath Overseer Due to Illness</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhao Daiwen assumed the position of chairman in the Provincial Government Zisheng Hall at 9 a.m. this morning. More than a thousand people from various agencies and organizations attended the ceremony. The ceremony was extremely grand. Yan Xishan changed the appointment of Chen Cheng as the oath overseer due to illness. Zhao's oath stated that he would never waste a penny or misuse a person, and that he would never engage in embezzlement, bribery, or acceptance of bribes. It is rumored that there will be a partial change in the committees of the provincial government. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Today is the first seventh day of Li Shengda's death anniversary. Yan sent Zhao Daiwen and Chen Cheng, Fu Zuoyi, and others to pay their respects. After Chen paid his respects to Li, he immediately took a plane to Xi'an to meet with Zhang Xueliang to discuss the suppression of the bandit army. Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Jun, Zhang Fakui, and others all sent telegrams to Li's family to express their condolences. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Suiyuan Shanxi Disaster Relief Association remitted 10,000 yuan to Shanxi for disaster relief, and Hubei remitted 2,000 yuan. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhao Pikang returned to Taiyuan late tonight to congratulate Zhao Daiwen on his new position and to report to Yan on the situation in Hebei and Chahar. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Build New Memorial Stele at Dagukou</h3>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese built a new memorial stele at Dagukou for Lieutenant Colonel Hattori and Major Shiraishi, who died in the Boxer Rebellion. The unveiling ceremony is scheduled for the 17th. At the same time, the groundbreaking ceremony for the naval pier will also be held. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Southwest Generals Deny Rumors by Telegram, Claiming Absolutely No Intention of Civil War; Li Zongren Suspends Return to Guangxi; Guangxi Army Still Stationed in Original Defenses</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Says Absolutely No Possibility of Civil War</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren suspended his return to Guangxi on the 5th. The Political Council believes that the Japanese are spreading rumors and provoking animosity between Beijing and Guangdong in order to benefit from the situation. It has decided to issue a telegram to the world to deny the rumors and declare that there is absolutely no intention of civil war. Chen Jitang telegraphed Yang Dezhao to enter Beijing to present the Southwest's opinions to Jiang. The Guangdong currency continued to fall on the 5th, with each yuan only worth five jiao in Hong Kong currency. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Xunzhi said on the 5th that the 7th and 15th Armies of Guangxi are still stationed in the Guilin and Quanzhou areas, and it is absolutely untrue that they have entered Hunan. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Executive Department held a joint meeting on the 5th and decided to send Chen Rong and 10 others to form the Hu Hanmin History Compilation Committee. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Feng Yuxiang on the 5th. Regarding the rumors in recent foreign telegrams and the problems of North China and smuggling, Feng explained and answered them one by one and expressed his opinions as follows: The news in foreign newspapers recently that the Allied Press reported that war would break out between the central government and the southwest is purely a provocation and rumor with ulterior motives. I am familiar with the central government and know that the central government will never put forward the so-called five conditions to the southwest. The central government's troops in the provinces surrounding Guangdong and Guangxi have already been transferred to other places one after another. The so-called attack on Guangdong and Guangxi with 350,000 troops is a ridiculous and unfounded rumor. At the same time, the relationship between the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi and the central government is becoming closer and more progressive day by day. Even if there are differences in the urgency of steps to save the country and survive, they can all discuss them openly from the perspective of being beneficial to the country and the nation. Therefore, in the current situation where the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, neither the central government nor the southwest can or want to engage in a civil war of self-destruction. Those foreign rumors, based on their consistent policy, want to systematically create opposition between the central government and various provinces, between provinces, and even between every person in every province, so that our country will become a divided and constantly civil war-torn situation, thereby diverting attention from domestic and foreign opposition to the aggressors. At the same time, they can achieve their ambitions without firing a single shot. Compare these rumors with the recent events in North China, and you can understand the intention behind these rumors. It is not difficult to understand their attempt to destroy the newborn forces in our country's national crisis. I absolutely believe that only when the Chinese people do not fight the Chinese people, unite like a family, and concentrate their efforts to make arduous struggles can we achieve the final victory of saving the country and surviving. Speaking of North China, because the aggressors are advancing step by step, the degree of danger is naturally becoming more serious day by day. This is an undeniable fact. However, we must never have the mistaken perception that North China has already been destroyed. In fact, since November of last year, North China has been maintained in hardship. We must know that our countermeasure is only the unity of officials and people. If we can unite by one point, we will increase the strength of saving the country by one point. If the entire country, from top to bottom, further strengthens the belief in solidarity and saving the country, and gradually tightens our national barriers and aligns our fighting pace in spirit and material, we will have the most magnificent and brightest future of victory. Regarding the large-scale smuggling problem, it is really no longer within the scope and meaning of ordinary so-called smuggling. Therefore, on the one hand, we earnestly hope that all levels of agencies will strictly implement the regulations on punishing tax evasion and various smuggling activities. On the other hand, we also hope that the people of the whole country will consciously rise up to investigate and suppress smuggled goods, resist smuggled goods, and strive to consolidate our country's economic barriers, so that smuggled goods will fundamentally disappear in the country. We should also use our greatest strength to protect state-owned industries and not allow our national economy to be harmed in the slightest. This is the lifeblood of our entire nation, and everyone should unite to protect this lifeline and strengthen this vital money. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>External Order: Ambassadors and Consuls Stationed Abroad Deny Rumors</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Japanese newspapers have fabricated rumors that the heads of the Southwest are plotting to form an independent government and have already begun military operations. This matter has been absolutely denied by the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities. As for the Japanese newspapers' claim that a large central army is concentrated in Fujian, Jiangxi, and other places, it is even more unfounded and is obviously intended for other purposes. A certain important person from the central government has already issued a statement to condemn it. The people of the country should not be confused by rumors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Japanese newspapers' fabrication of this news and its dissemination to various places are sufficient to disrupt international hearing. Therefore, it has specially telegraphed its ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad to strongly deny these unfounded rumors to the host countries in order to correct international perceptions. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Astonishing news from the Far East has been frequently reported in recent days. Today, the Chinese Embassy issued a formal statement denying it, saying that this news is not only unfounded but also malicious. Reuters, which is extremely cautious and well-informed, and has good judgment on Chinese affairs, inquired about three aspects. They all do not believe the news that the Nanning and Guangdong areas will start a civil war, saying that no party in China will have the thought of starting a civil war in the current critical situation. Everyone still regards smuggling in North China as a very important event. Therefore, everyone is paying close attention to the British government's economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, going to Tokyo. Although the price of Chinese bonds has fallen sharply, few have been sold. The best bonds are extremely difficult to buy. (5th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Effective Methods for People's Organizations to Assist in Preventing Smuggling</h3>
<p>—Year</p>
<p>We have always believed that, in addition to the government actively seeking ways to prevent smuggling, the people should also fulfill their responsibility to assist. We have expressed this passionately in issue 176 of our economic supplement. Recently, tax-evading smuggled goods have had a tendency to enter Shanghai and markets along the Yangtze River from areas near tax-evading ports in the north and south. The impending crisis has aroused the activities of various trade associations in this port. In terms of opinions, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, Mr. Ma Yinchu's broadcast lecture further advocated strengthening the organization of industrial and commercial groups and utilizing various relationships to prevent smuggling. Therefore, the matter of people's organizations assisting the government in cracking down on smuggling has made considerable progress in both facts and opinions. Now, please let's go a step further and talk about the methods of assistance.</p>
<p>First, we should jointly seek to make the various laws and regulations for preventing smuggling effective. The government's diplomatic solutions to the smuggling problem should be given more weight than the legal sanctions against unscrupulous merchants and the auditing and control. The "Provisional Regulations on Investigating and Controlling the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods" and the revised "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures to Prevent Road Smuggling" and the "Regulations on Punishing Tax Evasion" promulgated in the past two months are all aimed at preventing the trafficking of smuggled goods and protecting legitimate businesses. The Regulations on Investigating and Controlling the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods clearly stipulate the power of local trade associations or chambers of commerce to investigate and control the transportation and sale of goods, which has given people's organizations a legal basis to assist in cracking down on smuggling. The recent activities of the Sugar Industry Association in this port in offering rewards for reporting the transit of smuggled goods, the association's notice refusing to transport undocumented foreign goods, and the activities of the Silk Industry Association, etc., undoubtedly increase the effectiveness of cracking down on smuggling. If trade associations and people's organizations can follow suit according to the law, unscrupulous merchants will know fear and smuggled goods will have no market. The practical effect of curbing smuggling will be visible.</p>
<p>Second, exert organizational power to monitor unscrupulous merchants and those who are greedy for petty gains. We once said, "If there are no unscrupulous merchants, smuggled goods will have no way to be sold. If there are smuggled goods but no unscrupulous merchants, there is nothing they can do." As for how to ensure that there are no unscrupulous merchants in the country and how to prevent those who are greedy for petty gains from daring to patronize smuggled goods, it depends on the supervision of the masses. Because the masses are scattered and powerless, they must rely on existing people's organizations to exert their organizational power. In the current atmosphere, selling smuggled goods is a violation of national law, and purchasing smuggled goods is looked down upon by society. This has created a public opinion. Therefore, people's organizations' monitoring of unscrupulous merchants and those who are greedy for petty gains can use laws and morals as tools to assist the government in implementing laws and regulations and urge fellow groups not to abandon human virtues. Then, even if smugglers have talismans, they will have nothing to rely on. What can they do to me?</p>
<p>The rampant smuggling not only affects tariff revenue but has also become a major problem for China's industry and commerce. The prevention of smuggling involves complex relationships and cannot be effective by using only one method. Recently, the government has done its best to curb smuggling. People's organizations should, for the sake of the national economy, rise up and assist the government in removing internal obstacles together, so that those foreign companies that are engaged in this dishonest business will retreat in the face of difficulties because they have nothing to rely on and nothing to gain. Diplomatic solutions can also be discussed.</p>

<h3>Soviet Pravda Comments on the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda commented on the North China incident, saying, "The radical measures of the Japanese military have greatly influenced the growth of the anti-Japanese movement in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment has spread widely among the people of North China, creating a real threat to Japan's continued aggression. The movement to resist Japanese aggression has aroused serious attention in Tokyo. In fact, large parts of North China and Inner Mongolia are already resisting the Japanese authorities. In various important and military locations, the old Japanese garrisons have been expanded and a large number of new garrisons have been added. Both are assisted by a large number of tanks, armored vehicles, chemical teams, and air forces. The concentration of iron fists in North China not only wants to clear out all anti-Japanese elements and foreign troops on the North China battlefield but will also penetrate into the Yellow River Basin and Inner Mongolia. Japan is actively engaged here, as is the case in Central and Southern China." (5th, TASS)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Legislative Yuan's session on the 5th to discuss the Zhejiang Public Debt Consolidation Regulations, in addition to Ma Yinchu's report on the review process, Zhejiang members Lin Binlou, Tong Lisun, and others believed that using the land tax surcharge, i.e., the special land tax construction levy and surtax, as the fund for these public bonds would set a precedent for local governments issuing public bonds and increasing land tax surcharges. They advocated that the existing land tax surcharges in Zhejiang should be investigated first. Ma Shichu replied that the land tax surcharge must not exceed twice the regular tax, which has been clearly stipulated by the National Government. If Zhejiang Province wants to increase the land tax surcharge to serve as a public bond fund, the Ministry of Finance will not approve it, and the people can refuse to pay it. After Ye Chucang's explanation, the case was successfully passed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor: Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>Agriculture or Industry? (Part 1) By Zeng Diguang</p>
<p>The economic foundation of a country is based on agriculture, industry, and commerce. However, the order of importance and urgency of these three must be carefully considered in light of the environment and era in which a country finds itself, in order to arrive at a correct conclusion.</p>
<p>Since Columbus discovered the New World (1492), the advanced countries of Western Europe have benefited greatly from overseas trade, and they have rushed to develop colonies, fearing to be left behind. At that time, people in Western European countries almost all believed that a country should be based on commerce, and mercantilism emerged in response to the trend of the times.</p>
<p>The main ideas of mercantilism can be summarized into the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) To strive to bring foreign currency into the country;</p>
<p>(2) To strive to maintain a favorable balance of foreign trade;</p>
<p>(3) To find ways to increase domestic productivity.</p>
<p>However, foreign trade is the most important method of absorbing foreign currency, and industry is the precursor to commerce. Therefore, these three central ideas are very closely related. The main goal of mercantilism is to strive to maintain a favorable balance of foreign trade—exports exceeding imports—in order to allow foreign currency to flow into the country. Therefore, in order to achieve this goal, the government must encourage the development of domestic industry to increase exports, while at the same time preventing the inflow of foreign goods as much as possible.</p>
<p>If we study the basic concepts of mercantilism with today's perspective, it is not difficult to see where its errors lie. In addition to being a medium of exchange, currency is also a measure of value. Therefore, the quantity of currency and the value of goods are not only closely related, but also inversely proportional. What would be the result of a country seeking to increase exports and decrease imports in order to absorb foreign currency? The quantity theory of money has clearly shown that increasing the amount of currency in a country will inevitably raise the prices of domestic goods, which will result in a decrease in exports and an increase in imports, and the currency will flow out again. Therefore, attempting to absorb foreign currency by relying on the surplus of foreign trade is no different from a fool's dream. Moreover, the trade balance and the payment balance are different in nature. The so-called trade balance refers to the difference between the export and import of goods, while the so-called payment balance refers not only to the difference between the export and import of goods, but also includes the difference between various investments, principal and interest payments, the difference between international capital inflows and outflows, the difference between various remittances, the difference between various labor service compensations, the payment of indemnities, and the granting of bonuses, etc. Therefore, a negative trade balance may have a positive payment balance, as was the case with Britain, Germany, and France before the war; and a positive trade balance may have a negative payment balance, as was the case with the United States before the war. From this, it can be seen that it is virtually impossible to rely on the power of international trade to achieve a country's prosperity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although mercantilist believers have attempted to find ways to increase domestic productivity, their goal was to seek commercial profits. Therefore, they regarded industry as a means of absorbing foreign currency and maintaining the trade balance, which put the cart before the horse. Therefore, countries that dominated international trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as Spain and Portugal, failed immediately when competing with England and France, which were based on industry, because they did not make efforts to consolidate their domestic industrial foundation.</p>
<p>After the decline of the power of mercantilism, the power of the Physiocrats followed and dominated the Western European economic thought community. The main ideas of the Physiocrats can also be summarized into the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) They advocated that the government should adopt a laissez-faire policy toward the economic activities of the people;</p>
<p>(2) They believed that all industries were unproductive, and only agriculture could have a net product;</p>
<p>(3) They advocated abolishing all taxes and only levying a single tax on agriculture.</p>
<p>From today's perspective, this theory also has its shortcomings. It is dangerous to adopt a completely laissez-faire policy for the government's attitude towards the economic activities of the people, only seeking to protect the safety of people's lives and property. It is contrary to reason to think that farmers are the only producers and that industry and commerce are all idlers. The so-called production refers to increasing the utility of goods. Farmers produce goods from the land, making them available for human use and obtaining utility. Workers change the form of goods, making them more suitable for human needs. Merchants change the location of goods, supplementing the shortage of this place with the surplus of other places. Their work is all about increasing the utility of wealth. Therefore, there is no question that agriculture, industry, and commerce are all producers, and the argument for a single tax is also self-defeating.</p>
<p>By understanding the theories of the mercantilists and Physiocrats in the past, we can then consider the environment and era in which our country finds itself, and then discuss what should be the economic focus for transforming our country.</p>

<h3>France's Pro-Russian Policy</h3>
<p>Japanese Authorities Closely Watching</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Once a French left-wing cabinet headed by Socialist leader Léon Blum is established, it will inevitably strengthen Franco-Soviet cooperation and affect the Soviet Union's East Asian policy. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to the future policies of the cabinet. The following is a summary of the observations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The fundamental reason for the emergence of the left-wing cabinet is to reflect the national demand for strengthening security guarantees against Germany and rejecting the National Socialist Party. For the sake of strengthening security guarantees against Germany, although it is required to reorganize and strengthen the League of Nations, it cannot be realized rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen Franco-Soviet cooperation to prevent the threat from Germany. Although there is no direct change in relations with Japan, if pro-Soviet policies are strengthened, it will inevitably lead to the Soviet Union strengthening its East Asian policies. Therefore, its influence cannot be ignored. (5th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Important German Army Figure to be Dispatched to the Far East</h3>
<p>With a Special Mission</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Lechner, Commander-in-Chief of Bavaria, will soon be dispatched to the Far East with a special mission. The exact nature of the mission has not yet been revealed by the authorities. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Insists on Original Position. Anglo-Polish Talks Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>(London) Anglo-Russian naval talks continued at the Foreign Office today. There are still differences between the two sides, as Britain argues that the restrictions that can be stipulated in the future Anglo-Russian naval agreement should apply not only to the Baltic Sea, but also to the Far East. The Soviet Union still insists on its original position, believing that unless Japan is subject to the same restrictions one day, the future Anglo-Russian naval agreement will only apply to Europe. At this point, the trend of the talks seems to be in favor of the Soviet Union's position, and the way to resolve the issue in the future seems to be based on this. On the other hand, naval talks between Britain and Poland are also continuing and are expected to be successful soon. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The informal talks between Britain and Russia on the principles of the recent London Naval Treaty were stalled because Britain could not accept Russia's reservation that its Far Eastern fleet was not within the scope of the talks. The meeting was suspended for ten days to allow representatives of both sides to consult with their respective governments. Today, the two sides resumed talks at the British Foreign Office and discussed the entire scope of the qualitative restrictions of the treaty between the two sides. It is reported that satisfactory progress has been made. The talks do not involve quantitative restrictions. The sole purpose of the talks is to combine the qualitative restrictions of the London Naval Treaty with the provisions for prior exchange of shipbuilding programs between Britain and Russia. The application of qualitative restrictions will, of course, depend on Japan's attitude, just as the London Treaty itself must take effect depending on Japan's shipbuilding program. At the same time, the British naval circles hope that Russia can withdraw its reservation that its Far Eastern fleet will not be included in the scope of the talks, because if Britain accepts Russia's reservation, it will be recognized that Britain allows Russian fleets to operate freely in the Far East, which is an impression that Britain is eager to avoid.

He urged workers not to insist on their stubborn attitude, saying that France's democracy will usher in a great future. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new French Prime Minister Blum has formed the largest cabinet in French history today, with 20 Socialists, 11 Radical Socialists, 1 Communist, and 3 non-parliamentary members. The new cabinet will hold its first decisive meeting on Friday to draft an emergency plan to be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) At the beginning of the establishment of the new cabinet, the labor strike situation has not changed.

In addition, the new Minister of Interior Salengro and Minister of Labor Lero have already begun to deal with the resolution of the labor strike issue tonight. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Socialist cabinet was established at 11 p.m. last night. Except for the hardline newspapers, all other newspapers failed to be delivered due to the strike of the drivers of the Hachette News Agency. Therefore, the news of the establishment of the cabinet was delayed until this morning, when it was published by the left-wing newspapers. All these newspapers were delivered by special messengers on bicycles. Workers scrambled to read the newspapers as soon as they saw them. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The British newspapers are paying close attention to the establishment of the new French cabinet and are mostly expressing sympathy. The News Chronicle reported, "The British public opinion has expressed sympathy and goodwill at the beginning of the administration of the new French Prime Minister Léon Blum. Although France is currently encountering difficulties, its severity is not as great as it appears. Now that a powerful figure is in charge of the central government, everything can be easily solved. When US President Roosevelt took office in the past, he also faced many difficulties, which were arguably greater than the difficulties faced by the French government at this time. Fortunately, difficulties and hardships are a good opportunity for powerful people to exercise their skills." The Daily Citizen reported, "The French economic crisis can only be resolved by the devaluation of the franc." (5th Havas Telegram)</p>

He concluded by saying that the significance of the results of the re-election of the previous Chamber of Deputies is that the people are eager to revitalize themselves through the existing system and are very aware of the price they have to pay for unclear actions. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Brief History of the New Prime Minister Blum</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum was born in Paris and is now fifty-four years old. Here is a brief history of him: In 1890, he graduated from the Higher Normal School with a degree in literature. In 1895, he entered the Council of State and continued to serve there for twenty-four years, until he was elected as a member of parliament in 1919, when he resigned.</p>
<p>In 1899, he joined various socialist groups. At that time, these groups were not unified. Léon Blum organized the Unified Socialist Association with his classmates and friends in that year, and followed the socialist leaders such as Jaurès (Jaurès was assassinated by political enemies in 1914 when Germany declared war on France) to work hard on the unification movement. After six years of struggle, he formed the Socialist Party in 1905 and published the book "History of Workers' and Socialists' Congresses," which was very popular. In 1904, he helped Jaurès found "L'Humanité." In 1906, he abandoned the life of a socialist fighter and devoted himself to literary creation in his spare time. Several years before the outbreak of the European War, he published dramatic and literary criticisms in "Le Matin," which have been compiled into books. In 1914, when the Great War broke out, the Socialist Party abandoned its original position and came forward to participate in the cabinet. Samba, a member of the party, took the position of Minister of Public Works and appointed Léon Blum as his chief of staff. On November 16, 1919, he was elected as a member of parliament and has since served as the secretary of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group, engaging in legislative work and serving as a speaker in the Chamber of Deputies from time to time. At the National Congress of the Socialist Party held in Tours in 1920, extremists advocated accepting the Comintern platform, which led to disagreements with other party members, who left the party and organized the Communist Party. Léon Blum and his political friends continued to maintain the original organization of the Socialist Party and, since that year, renamed it the Orthodox Socialist Party. In 1921, he became the general manager of "Le Populaire," which became the organ of the Orthodox Socialist Party.</p>
<p>In the 1928 re-election of the Chamber of Deputies, Léon Blum was once defeated, but in April of the following year, when a by-election was held for a vacant seat in the Chamber, he was re-elected. The Socialist Party's parliamentary group elected him as the chairman of the parliamentary group. Since then, he has been re-elected in every election.</p>
<p>In 1936, that is, on April 26 and May 3 of this year, the Chamber of Deputies was re-elected. The Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Communist Party jointly ran for election with the common platform of the Popular Front. As a result, they won a great victory, and the Socialist Party jumped to become the largest party. Léon Blum also took office as Prime Minister according to custom. (Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Paris Stock Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the new Blum government, the stock exchange presented an optimistic atmosphere this morning, because it is expected that the new Prime Minister will find ways to stabilize the labor strikes. The prices of public bonds are all firm, and the price of the stock of the Bank of France has risen by 230 francs. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>

The train will connect with the Aquitania mail ship and sail to the United States. The total amount of cash transported is 143 boxes, worth 150 million francs. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Comment on the French Political Situation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official newspaper "Foreign Political Review" commented on the organization of the new French government, saying, "Most of the members of the new French cabinet slander the policies adopted by Poincaré, but there are also many well-known members of the cabinet who are working hard to implement the Franco-Soviet agreement." Germany has no unfair criticism of the new French government at all, because Germany has always advocated that all countries should have the right to self-determination in their domestic policies. Therefore, Germany itself also hopes to have the right to self-determination in domestic affairs without external interference. From this point of view, some of the slogans of the Popular Front are not surprising to Germany. If these slogans are only implemented domestically, the newspaper said that it hopes that there will be true understanding between Germany and France and that the new government can work hard to succeed in this area.

<h3>Labor Strikes Spread Throughout France, Possessing Revolutionary Characteristics</h3>
<p>Situation Deteriorates Further Yesterday. Participants Reach 300,000</p>
<p>(Paris) The sit-down strike movement is more severe than yesterday. Workers at the Renault automobile factory in Billancourt went on a short strike and then resumed work. Now, they accuse the employer of not complying with the terms of the contract and have declared a strike again. This move is very important, because it is the first time that a large manufacturer has broken a contract and gone on strike again after settling the contract. 80 factories in the North Province, with a total of 60,000 workers, are now on strike. The weaving industry is affected. The total number of strikers is 300,000. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike wave has now spread throughout the country, and flour mill workers have also joined, causing panic in the supply of bread. Although Communist leaders have previously stated that they will never obstruct the supply of general food, the strike of motor vehicle drivers has indeed made it difficult to supply vegetables, meat, fish, and other foods. Workers at the Paris western suburb gas plant have also abandoned their posts, causing the gas in the gas tank to gradually decrease. A large number of workers, agitated by the left-wing elements in power, have gone on strike to pressure the future new government to recognize workers' demands for increased wages, reduced working hours, and collective bargaining agreements. The important coal mines in the Liévin district have now been affected. After the failure of the mediation negotiations held by the metallurgical factory employers at the Ministry of Labor, a statement was issued stating that this strike has evolved into an unprecedented revolutionary state and is a great threat to private property rights. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike wave has recently spread to the northern coal mining areas. About 5,000 workers in the Longueville mining area left the mines and quietly returned home because there were not enough coal cars in the mine and the coal cars outside the mine stopped running. 1,000 workers in the Ternan mining area occupied the mines and refused to leave. In addition, 2,000 workers in the metallurgical factories and iron factories in the Sambre River basin in the northeast have also decided to strike and occupy the factory buildings. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Because the drivers of the newspaper delivery company are on strike and cannot deliver newspapers, only six newspapers are published: "L'Humanité," "Le Populaire," "Le Peuple," "L'Aurore," "La République," and "Action Française." Among them, "Le Populaire," the organ of the Orthodox Socialist Party, "L'Humanité," the organ of the Communist Party, and "Le Peuple," the organ of the General Confederation of Labor, all said that the labor strike was very large and did not express dissatisfaction. "Le Populaire" reported, "Regarding the fact that the metallurgical industry union was able to sign a work contract with the capitalists on behalf of the workers, the labor and capital sides conducted negotiations yesterday, but the employer's union refused to continue negotiations on the pretext that the striking workers had not all withdrawn from the factory buildings, and therefore declared a breakdown. This is the most important thing yesterday. In fact, each employer has already promised to allow the union to sign a work contract on behalf of the workers. This decision is intended to create an atmosphere with the excuse that the workers have not all withdrawn, so that people who are not left-wing or right-wing about the labor strike will be disgusted, and each employer will be able to go back on his word." The Communist Party's organ "L'Humanité" reported, "The power of this strike movement is great. The main reason is that the standard of living has continued to increase for several years, and workers' wages have been tightened. The Popular Front encountered this difficult situation at the beginning of its administration. The Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor will certainly support it without reservation, so as to be able to act as an arbitrator to seek a quick solution to the labor strike." As for the tone of "L'Aurore," the organ of the General Confederation of Labor, it is more pessimistic, saying that Italian workers have also occupied factories, and the fascist regime was established as a result. This must be prevented in France. "Moreover, French workers account for a minority of the national population, which is the same as in Italy. The Popular Front was won because farmers, merchants, and the petty bourgeoisie voted in favor of it. These people are used to the old ways and are deeply troubled by changes in life. They should be taken into consideration. Although the current situation will not cause panic, it has a tendency to become more serious and cannot be ignored. Before taking office, the new cabinet was constrained by constitutional forms, which delayed the opportunity. At this time, it should take action to seek its own effectiveness." The royalist organ "Action Française" was headlined "France Under Jewish Control" and said that the strike movement has revolutionary characteristics and that the period of panic has arrived.

<h3>Italian Troop Movements Near Brenner Pass Intended to Warn the Powers to Lift Sanctions</h3>
<p>Some Say It's Related to Austrian Restoration</p>
<p>(Rome) Rumors are rife about troop mobilizations and movements, causing great tension throughout Italy. Although the authorities have denied reports of large-scale maneuvers near the Austrian border and the Brenner Pass on the road from Germany to Italy, it is widely believed that something is about to happen. The authorities have maintained strict secrecy regarding troop movements, so no confirmed information has been obtained to date. The Brenner Pass may see demonstrations against the continued sanctions, as Austria is also opposed to sanctions. Several quarters believe that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg's visit to Italy is related to the possibility of a Habsburg restoration. However, it is generally believed that Mussolini is currently trying to strengthen Italian-German solidarity and will not take any action that would offend Germany. Furthermore, a Habsburg restoration would likely trigger intervention by Yugoslavia, as the Little Entente (Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia) has always strongly opposed the restoration of the Austrian monarchy. Mussolini is currently staying at a country villa, refusing to see guests. Mussolini always retreats to this place before making major decisions. It is expected that Schuschnigg and Mussolini will meet today outside Florence. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in Geneva are greatly concerned after news of large-scale Italian war preparations emerged today. According to reports, schools in northern Italy will close one month before the scheduled holidays so that school buildings can be used for military purposes; a number of naval reservists have been called up; two classes of reservists have received orders to be ready to deploy; Italian expatriates in Geneva have been warned to be ready to assemble; military activities are currently underway on the French and Yugoslavian borders. The significance of this news is unclear to people in the League of Nations. The fact that this surprising news emerged at the same time as Italian Governor-General of Addis Ababa, Marshal Badoglio, is returning home suggests that it is intended to warn the powers against tightening or maintaining sanctions against Italy, or that it is related to the Habsburg restoration in Austria. Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg is currently visiting the Tuscan port of Viareggio in Italy, where he may meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, leading to speculation about a Habsburg restoration. It is reported that Germany and Italy have reached a compromise on the Austrian restoration. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

Therefore, he realized that cooperation between China and Japan could realize the situation that Britain hoped for in China. Therefore, Ross came to Japan again to discuss China's economic problems and issues related to Japan and Australia, Japan and Britain, and other issues related to the UK and Japan.

<h3>Japanese Fascist Party, Kokuhonsha, to Dissolve Within Days</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Kokuhonsha, which is a major force among Japanese patriotic groups, aiming to strengthen the patriotic movement, and believed to have a voice in political institutions, is on the verge of dissolution due to changes in social circumstances. This Kokuhonsha was founded by Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma in March of Taisho 3 (1914), with the heads and backbones of military, judicial, and local officials as its main constituents. There are a total of 200,000 general members belonging to 170 branches scattered throughout the country, making it a very powerful group.

<h3>Japanese Police Lead Ronin to Commit Violence in Jinan, Beating Customs Officers and Looting Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Central Government dispatched customs officers to Jinan at the end of last month to organize an inspection office, determined to investigate and ban smuggled goods, smuggled goods have still been coming to Jinan from Tianjin for three or four days. In addition to the 32 packages of cigarette paper that were transported yesterday, which have already been transported away, those detained at the station include 290 tons of white sugar and 45 tons of raw silk, which are guarded by the customs office pending negotiations. Today (the 3rd), four Japanese policemen led many Koreans and Chinese traitors to the station to see the head of the customs office, Ye Yuchun, and demanded the goods. One of the Japanese policemen, named Nishino Masamori, had a card printed with the words "Ministry of Foreign Affairs Investigation Department Jinan Japanese Police Station Service." His words were extremely barbaric and unreasonable. He said that Tianjin is also Chinese territory, so why is my freight company allowed to operate in Tianjin, and Jinan has no customs, so why are you forcibly detaining my goods? Ye Yuchun showed him the Central Government's official document, and the Japanese policeman smiled grimly and threw it on the ground, saying, "Our Japanese Consulate does not recognize your inspection office." Ye still tried to dissuade him from transporting the goods, pending a negotiated resolution for their return. The Japanese policeman refused to listen, and also said that there are Japanese troops in Tianjin and Japanese naval forces in Qingdao, which can arrive within a few hours. If you forcibly detain my goods, are you willing to bear this responsibility? Negotiations lasted for about an hour without results. At that time, Zhao Binglin, the chief of the Jinpu Railway Police Section, was there. Seeing that negotiations were fruitless, the Japanese policeman ordered the Koreans to move forward to transport the goods. Zhao Binglin and Ye Yuchun still wanted to dissuade them, but they were crowded up and beaten, and the smuggled goods were forcibly carried out of the station, loaded onto vehicles, and transported to Japanese foreign firms. In an instant, they were gone. Zhao and Ye immediately telegraphed the situation to the Customs Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Jinpu Railway Bureau.</p>
<h3>After the Great Flood in Guangdong Province, Various Regions Face Famine and Await Relief; Rice Fields in the East and West Rivers Are Mostly Submerged, with No Hope for the Early Rice Harvest</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: At the beginning of this year's spring, various regions of Guangdong Province suffered from severe drought. The fields were cracked and unable to be plowed, and the early rice seedlings were planted out of season. Food shortages were widespread, and villagers were calling for relief. Unexpectedly, in mid-May, torrential rains fell in all the rivers, lasting for more than ten days. The fields that had been parched and dry in the past were suddenly turned into wetlands. The only remaining rice crops that had not been damaged by the drought were then submerged in water. According to investigations, the areas that suffered the greatest losses were Gaoyao and Luoding counties in the West River region, and Huiyang, Boluo, and Heyuan counties in the East River region. In recent days, telegrams requesting relief from the floods have been pouring in from various groups. According to reports, in the first and sixth districts of Gaoyao County, due to the surge of the West River, the rice fields in all villages were submerged in the vast floodwaters, and tens of thousands of starving people were crying out for food. On the 26th, the Gaoyao Chamber of Commerce and the Zhaoqing Charity Hall telegraphed the provincial authorities to allocate funds for relief. In Luoding County, the entire region had suffered from drought for the past four months. Since May 6th, there had been torrential rains every night for more than twenty days, turning the fields into a vast expanse of water. The water level of the Long River rose by more than ten feet, and all the rice and miscellaneous grains were washed away. In the East River region, the most severe disaster was in Heyuan. On May 16th and 17th, there was continuous heavy rain, and the river water suddenly rose by more than thirty feet. The city was turned into a swamp, and the water depth in the shops was more than ten feet. Two shops on Chongchang Hualong Road and one shop on Taiping Road were washed away, and two elementary school students drowned. More than one hundred acres of rice fields in Dongpu Township were submerged. After the flood, famine followed. In Boluo County, a great flood entered the city in the middle of last month, and the water level on Pingdi, Xianqian Road, Qiaotou Road, and Tielu Lane reached more than ten feet. Outside the South Gate, the water level reached the eaves of the houses. Residents fled to the First Market to live. The price of rice rose several times a day, and white rice rose to one dollar and six cents per peck. Most of the poor disaster victims were starving. Nine houses in the Chicken Market were washed away by the flood, seven houses collapsed on Lower Street, and three houses collapsed outside the South Gate. All the rice fields in the villages were lost. Heping County, located in the upper reaches of the East River and surrounded by mountains, experienced a sudden mountain flood on the 17th of last month. The number of houses destroyed in the city was countless, and more than one hundred acres of rice fields were submerged. More than twenty feet of the river embankment collapsed, and there was no hope for the early rice harvest. The disaster was unprecedented in the past twenty years. After the floodwaters of the East River receded at the end of last month, there was another torrential rain on the first day of this month, and the floodwaters rose again by more than five feet, causing the villagers to feel terrified. Conghua County, located between the Northeast and Second Rivers, was originally a rice-producing area. However, due to continuous rain in recent days, the mountain floods have surged, and low-lying areas have been submerged by the floods. According to statistics, more than fifty acres of early rice in the first district have been lost, and more than thirty acres of miscellaneous grains have been lost.

<h3>Fujian Province Strictly Cracks Down on Smuggling</h3>
<p>Coastal areas have established inspection offices and implemented strict smuggling prevention measures. Fuzhou correspondence: The Provincial Tax Inspection Office, which is responsible for investigating and cracking down on smuggling, was officially established on May 28th. Its branch offices in the coastal areas of eastern and southern Fujian will also be fully established by the beginning of June. The provincial government has also formulated measures for coordinating smuggling prevention. The following is an excerpt: (1) The Tax Inspection Office is responsible for inspecting and verifying provincial tax work, limited to special business taxes, such as gasoline, kerosene, Yang wax candles, fertilizer, sugar, tea, seafood, and other smuggling matters. (2) When smuggled goods are seized, they must be auctioned or punished, and the provincial taxes that should be paid must be paid first and allocated to the department. At the same time, the inspection office patrol station or branch office must notify the competent authority. (3) After the smuggled goods are auctioned or punished, the inspection office will issue a sales receipt. For gasoline, kerosene, Yang wax candles, fertilizer, etc., a registration certificate must also be attached. If it is transported to other places, a tax bill or transportation bill must be filled out. However, all bills and registration certificates shall be issued by the department. (4) If county governments, tax authorities, road protection teams, automobile companies, and automobile stations obtain confidential reports on smuggling, they must quickly notify the nearby inspection office or the security team responsible for smuggling prevention. (5) Patrol stations or branch offices and security teams must quickly go to investigate when they receive confidential reports from county governments, tax authorities, road protection teams, automobile companies, and automobile stations in order to achieve practical results. (6) If patrol stations or branch offices need the assistance of county governments, tax authorities, road protection teams, automobile companies, and automobile stations, they should provide as much convenience as possible within their capabilities when they receive their notice. (7) Other coordination methods should be discussed and handled by each patrol station and each branch office with the tax authorities, automobile companies, and the county government in their jurisdiction. (8) If the patrol station or branch office has a confidential report on smuggling in the cargo trucks of automobile companies, or if there are suspicions that need to be checked, they may be checked at any time at the bus station or nearby location. (9) In order to expedite smuggling prevention, patrol stations or branch offices and smuggling prevention security teams may use the telephone lines of the joint counties when they need to use the telephone. (10) The original tax authorities that specialize in smuggling prevention should gradually centralize and unify their work under the management of the inspection office, and the smuggling inspectors should be dismissed in order to save expenses. The dismissal of regional police officers will be determined by another order from the department. (11) If the tax authorities also handle smuggling prevention matters, in addition to transferring the smuggling prevention duties to the inspection office, all collection matters will still be handled by the original authorities. (12) The inspection office should issue various forms and styles of documents regarding the collection of taxes by various tax authorities to each patrol station or branch office for distribution to the staff for careful identification. If merchants purchase and transport goods with tax bills or registration certificates, they should immediately check and release them. If there are no documents or the goods do not match the documents, they should be treated as smuggled goods. (13) After the candidates for each branch office are appointed, the inspection office should convene them for training on the names, organizational system, tax rules and penalties, tax bill stickers, and smuggling prevention methods of each special tax bureau. (14) In order to make each patrol station or branch office understand the connection between smuggling prevention, in addition to these measures, the inspection office should formulate smuggling prevention guidelines and issue them to each patrol station or branch office for compliance.

<h3>Zou Lu Leaves Guangdong to Go Abroad; Requests Three Months Leave from the Southwest Political Affairs Council to Attend the International Education Conference in Europe</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Zou Lu, member of the Southwest Party Committee and President of the National Sun Yat-sen University, recently requested leave from the Southwest Political Affairs Council, starting from the 22nd of this month, due to the current situation and circumstances, to go to Europe to attend the International Education Conference. Therefore, after requesting leave, he planned to go abroad. However, due to the sudden death of Mr. Hu Hanmin, Zou's departure was delayed. He left Guangdong for Hong Kong to wait for a ship after the public memorial service for Mr. Hu. He finally left the country on the Italian postal ship Victoria on the 28th. Accompanying him were Professor Cheng Honghao of the School of Chemistry of Zhongda University and Mr. Liu Zhenxian. Xiao Guanying, the former director of academic affairs of Zhongda University, was on the same ship. Those who saw him off included professors from various colleges of Zhongda University, Qu Fangpu, the head of the Guangdong Finance Department, Cheng Hongxuan of the Municipal Party Committee, and dozens of others. When Zou was about to leave, he made a public statement to reporters, the original text of which is as follows: "I am going abroad this time at the invitation of the International University Conference from June 24th to 27th, and to participate in the commemoration of the 550th anniversary of Heidelberg University in Germany. If time permits, I will also attend the World Education Conference to be held in England in early August, and visit the Berlin International Sports Conference. I was originally scheduled to take the German ship Garachen Slave to Europe on the 22nd of this month, but due to the death of Mr. Hu, I changed to the Italian ship Victoria, which is sailing today. The round trip is expected to take three months." That afternoon at 4 o'clock, those who came to see him off gathered at the dock. The port of departure only returned at 5 o'clock. It was found that Zou was accompanied by industrial education, and then went to France, Germany, England, Czechoslovakia, and Russia. Liu Zhenxian attended the World Mathematical Conference. It is said that Zou Lu has requested Deng Zhiyi, the president of the Southwest Political Affairs Institute and acting dean of academic affairs, to act on his behalf during his trip abroad. According to external rumors, Zou will stay in Europe for three months. When he returns, he may go to Beijing first to handle central party affairs. (May 29th)</p>
<h3>Jinan City Bans Strange Clothing; Police on Duty Enforce the Law Impartially; Modern Women Embarrassed on the Thoroughfare</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Government, in order to implement the New Life Movement and promote old morals, has set standards for the clothing worn by people in society and decided to implement a ban on strange clothing starting on June 1st. In recent times, young men and women have been tending towards modern fashion. This is not often seen in Jinan among men, but among women, at the beginning of summer, they are vying to show off their unique styles and compete with each other. Their shirts are so long that they drag on the ground, and their sleeves are shorter than their elbows. Their pants are meant to cover their lower bodies, but they are shorter than their knees. They choose materials that are as light as clouds and as thin as cicada wings, and their colors are intended to be bright, with jade colors displayed, attracting attention as they pass through the streets, and confusing passers-by. This not only hinders the view but also damages public morals. Since the government issued the announcement, many people have automatically changed their clothing. However, there are still some people who are obsessed with modern fashion and have not changed.</p>
<p>Today (the 1st) is the first day of the implementation of the ban on strange clothing. The police of the Public Security Bureau are responsible for banning and dissuading people from wearing strange clothing. The morning was not very tense. But in the afternoon, as the sun set, modern women began to go out, either to go to entertainment venues or to stroll slowly through the streets. The police enforcing the law were very busy. The West Gate Street is the thoroughfare of Jinan City and the commercial port, and the traffic of people coming and going is heavy. The police on duty there are especially iron-faced and impartial, inspecting and taking samples without any favoritism. When they encounter people who pass the standard, they first advise them to change their clothes and allow them to pass. Many women are ashamed and embarrassed, and bow their heads and leave. There are also those who refuse to be persuaded and argue with the police. There are also those who turn from shame to anger and respond with harsh words. For a time, the passers-by on the side of the road stopped to watch, and the pedestrians on the West Gate Road became crowded.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuju, has always followed the law. This time, he is especially serious about taking samples of strange clothing, and his subordinates are even more swift and vigorous. According to the results of the implementation today (the 1st), Wang Xi, a female nurse at Qilu Hospital, was sent to the police station by the police in charge. In addition, five women, Wang Yuzhen, Hu Jingzhi, Jin Caifeng, Wang Guoqing, and Sun Suzhen, were taken to the police station on West Gate Street for refusing to listen to the police's advice. Tonight (the 1st), Wang Xi and the other seven people were sent from the Da Ximen Public Security Bureau substation to the third branch of the city and then to the general bureau. They were released after being reprimanded by the judicial section.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Security Brigade Commander Transferred</h3>
<p>Zhao Zanchen, commander of the 12th Security Brigade, has been in office for more than a year. He has trained soldiers, rectified internal affairs, and investigated bandits. He has a good reputation and has been praised by the inspection committee of the Military Commission. Last month, he was ordered to go to Punan to suppress bandits and successfully captured the bandit leader Li Xiang, who had robbed cars. The bandit atmosphere in Punan has been cleared, and the people are grateful. Recently, the Provincial Security Command has ordered the commander to be transferred to Taixing to be replaced by Yang Bianheng, the commander of the brigade. The handover procedures are currently being carried out.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Request to Increase the Price of Silkworm Cocoons</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Farmers' Association has repeatedly reported from various district farmers' associations that the price of mulberry leaves is high this year, but the cocoon industry association stipulates that the highest price of cocoons is 30 yuan. This is too different from the cost. It is requested to increase the price of cocoons in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, a joint meeting of representatives from various district farmers' associations and the cocoon industry was held in the auditorium of the county party headquarters. More than 80 people attended, including Li Yangping and Tang Pu'an. The following resolutions were made: (1) The method of drying cocoons by scattered households will be abolished this year, so that farmers cannot dry cocoons freely, which is close to coercion. A unanimous protest should be made to open it up as soon as possible. (2) The opening date will be determined by the conference on June 6, but silk factories use the name of cooperation to collect cocoons one day in advance in order to avoid all donations and taxes. This should be strictly prohibited. (3) The price of fresh cocoons, combined with the current silk market, can still make a profit of 40 yuan. It should be stipulated as 40 yuan per load. After the above three resolutions were made, Su Weibin, Yang Bangjie, and five others were appointed to petition the county government's cocoon improvement management committee and the cocoon and mulberry model area. Li, the section chief of the county government, said that the three items raised were all related to the people's livelihood and would be submitted to Magistrate Long to expedite the formulation of relief measures. Zhou Yuanxun, director of the cocoon and mulberry model area, said that the issue of increasing the price of cocoons has been discussed with the county government, and a definite solution will be found within a few days. At this point, the representatives left happily. It was also heard that Zeng Jikuan, director of the Improvement Association, arrived in Wuxi at 12 noon yesterday to inspect the improvement matters. Magistrate Long and Committee Member Li of the Party Department had discussed the cocoon price issue with him once. In addition, according to reports from various places, the cocoon debt of the Cocoon Industry Association also varies. The following is a breakdown: (1) Liyang: The opening scales were opened successively on the 3rd and 4th, with the highest cocoon price being 30 yuan and the lowest being 24 yuan. (2) Suzhou: The opening scales were opened on the 3rd, with the highest being 40 yuan and the lowest being 20 yuan. (3) Yixing: Some cocoon shops opened their scales on the 4th, with the highest being 30 yuan. (4) Jiangyin: The opening scales are scheduled for the 7th, with the highest cocoon price being 30 yuan and the lowest being 21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Station Investigates Smuggling</h3>
<p>Smuggling in North China is expanding day by day and has already encroached on the Jinpu and Jinghu lines. In order to prevent road transport smuggling, the Zhenjiang Customs specially sent Gu Zhongyi and Shen Jicheng to Wuxi on the night train the night before, and contacted Station Master Li Guisheng. Yesterday, they also went to various places to conduct a thorough investigation to see if there were any smuggled goods, and decided to establish a smuggling prevention inspection office at Wuxi Station. Shen and Gu will be stationed in Wuxi on a regular basis to actively investigate smuggling matters.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Jingchuan Road Construction Completed</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Jingchuan, a virtuous man from Wuyi, was a local in the town. The locals built Jingchuan Road to commemorate the national hero, and redesigned and rebuilt his original reading place in the southern suburbs, giving it a new look. It is reported that Jingchuan Road and the reading place have been completed one after another, and the completion ceremony will be held at the reading place on the 14th of this month. On that day, people attending will be picked up and transported free of charge by several cars of all sizes from the Wuyi Company by land, and by boat from the Dakai Iron Factory, which has newly invented a hard firewood-burning boat, by water. You can also visit Baitang outside the southern suburbs. Party and state dignitaries Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Zhou Fohai, Cai Zimin, and others will come to Changzhou to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Dispute over Selling Japanese Coal</h3>
<p>Liujiang coal from Lin County, Hebei, has always been transported and sold to the Nanjing-Suzhou, Shanghai-Zhenjiang area, and its sales are quite wide. Since the mine was taken over by the neighboring Taiji Company using the special power of the Japanese in the spring of last year, the coal has been transported to the Mitsui Depot in Shanghai, named Hebei White Coal, and sold everywhere. Coal and lightering industries in various ports have vigorously maintained justice and agreed to refuse to handle it, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Department was petitioned to order a ban. The matter was suspended indefinitely. The coal has been accumulating in the Shanghai depot for a long time with no solution. Mitsui has repeatedly negotiated with the Liujiang Company authorities in Shanghai, but no solution has been reached, and they have tried their best to find another way out. At the beginning of January this year, Yu Yiqin, Lu Ruixiang, and Lin Junbao from Wujin, and Sha Wenda and Hua Ruiqing from Jiangyin, were moved by profit and disregarded everything, and secretly contacted to sell it. An agreement has been reached, and it was decided to set up a general sales office in Wujin and a branch sales office in Jiangyin. All the coal sold will be transported by lighter from the Yangtze River and unloaded and transported from Huangtiangang Port. However, the Kaiyun and Zhongxing wharves believe that the coal is related to national personality and people's morality, and participation in the activity is close to a certain role, and they unanimously refused to lighter it. At the same time, Yin Zhongren, a representative of the Liujiang Company, presented the matter to the Jiangyin Party and government organs, ordering the county chamber of commerce and the coal industry association to effectively stop and punish it. Now there are 3,000 tons of coal ships scheduled to be transported to Cheng on the 6th, and will continue to be transported in the future. People inside have prepared everything, and the coal ships will stop at the center of the river at Huangtiangang Port to start evil, and the Pu Huiqiao North River East Former Customs site has been rented as a warehouse. Shen Fugeng contracted all the loading and unloading work, and the lightering boats were shipped from Shanghai because no one rented them out. If there is any obstruction, the Liujiang Company has again presented the matter to the Party and government organs, strictly preventing it, fearing that it will cause a major dispute.</p>
<h3>Changshu Pilot Severely Injured in Beating</h3>
<p>Zou Zinan, a second-class pilot who returned from Japan after completing his studies on the 28th of last month, was originally from this town. After returning to Shanghai, he took the opportunity to return home to visit his relatives before going to Beijing to serve. After Zou arrived in Changshu on the 1st, his relatives held banquets to welcome him back. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 3rd, on his way home after drinking, he had a quarrel with a woman. The police station of a company's branch station, mistaking him for a thug, tied him and his brothers and servants together and beat them severely with whips and wooden sticks, causing Zou and others to suffer serious injuries. Zi Nan's internal organs were severely damaged. He was then taken to the general bureau, and after explaining the situation, he was released on bail. He is currently in the hospital, and Zou Zinan's injuries are difficult to recover for a while. The public security substation, knowing that it had caused trouble, reported that public property had been damaged and that seven police officers had been injured. The society was quite unfair for a time.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Axe Gang Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Fugui, the leader of the Jiaxing Axe Gang, had previously committed a crime. He was arrested by the County Public Security Bureau and sent to the county, and was sentenced by the Provincial Security Office. He was released from prison last year and remained in He. Recently, Chen has been involved in irregular incidents. On the afternoon of the 4th, the city district detective team first arrested Chen's accomplice Geng Longshi, and then arrested Chen Fugui. He is currently being held in the detective team, and after investigating Chen's irregular incidents and arresting his accomplices, he will be investigated and dealt with.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Batch of Thieves Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing District Administrative Inspectorate and the Security Command were ordered to execute by firing squad at the Da school grounds at 9 am on the 4th seven thieves who had been robbing in Shaoxing and Xiao counties: Ren Zhanglai, Chen Huabao, Chen Wuba, Wu Ziqing, Chen Alian, He Jiafa, and Lin Jin'ao. It was found that the criminals were arrested in Hangzhou by the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital in October last year. The Shaoxing County Government sent personnel to Hangzhou to welcome and bring them back. The confessions were sent to the command headquarters, and they confessed to robbing Ying Shunchang, Anchang, Liang Arui, Liang Awang, Liang Ayue in Daranzang, Shaoxing County, and Chen Mingtai and Chen Aitong in Tangtou Nan'an, Xiaoshan County. They were sentenced to death and reported to the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government for approval. On this day, a team was sent to take the criminals held in the court's detention center, verify their identities, and bind them to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Others Return North and Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday; Sun and Others Deny Rumors of Southwest Unrest; Yang Dezhao Will Go to Beijing Today to Meet President Jiang</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Xu Chongzhi, Li Wenfan, Fu Bingchang, and Yang Dezhao, the special envoys of the Central Government to pay tribute to Hu Hanmin, Luo Yicao, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Guangdong River Management Committee, Zhang Tingfan, a member of the Central Committee, and Yu Hongjun, a representative of Mayor Wu, and other gentlemen, left Hong Kong together on the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's President Taft and returned north. They arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday. Those who went to welcome them included Li Dachao, a representative of Mayor Wu, Wang Zhinan, a representative of Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, Liu Weichi, Jian Youwen, Lin Baisheng, Zhuang Zhihuan, Liu Houwu, a member of the Supervisory Committee, Cai Jingjun, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cheng Tiangu, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Ziqun, and Tang Zhaoshi, and many others. After Sun and others disembarked, they took three small ferries, Yuebao, Jinghui, and Jingguang, and crossed the river separately. At 1:30 pm, they landed at the new customs wharf and returned to their private residences to rest. Tang Haian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Li Hongwen, a representative of Yan Xishan, stayed in the port for a while and did not return north on the same ship.</p>
<p>President Sun Discusses the Peace in the Southwest</p>
<p>When President Sun changed to the Yuebao small ferry to cross the river, he sat on a sofa and read Chinese and foreign newspapers with a very relaxed attitude. Reporters from various newspapers approached him and formed a circle. Sun smiled and said, "I am reading newspapers to find news. There is no news for you." A reporter asked about the news of the Southwest unrest reported by Japan. Sun replied in a humorous tone, "This is what the Japanese hope for." The reporter asked, "Then what is the truth?" Sun said, "This is just what the Japanese hope for, and the truth is that there is nothing." "Although I did not talk about state affairs in Guangdong, from what I have observed, the Southwest is quite peaceful. The rumors are not credible." After Sun finished speaking, he continued to read the newspaper and did not want to make other statements.</p>
<p>Yang Dezhao Denies War Rumors</p>
<p>Yang Dezhao is Chen Jitang's representative in Beijing. His return north by ship is enough to be the opposite of the war rumors. Yang denied the war rumors to reporters on the ferry. According to Yang, the Allied Press of Japan reported that there would be unrest in the Southwest against the Central Government. This is absolutely untrue and not credible. At this time of serious national crisis, the whole country is united and has not even thought about it. How can we cause civil war and bring about our own destruction? Mr. Chen Bonan has always supported the Central Government, and his intentions have never changed. The rumors are obviously made by someone else with a purpose. I hope that the country will not lightly believe them and fall for their tricks. Yang continued, "If the Southwest were to have unrest as reported by the foreign news, then why would I come north again today?" I have a personal letter from Mr. Chen Bonan to President Jiang, and I will go to Beijing tomorrow (that is, today) to meet him and hand it over."</p>
<p>Luo Yiwei Talks About Hu's Funeral in Guangdong</p>
<p>Xu Chongzhi, Li Wenfan, and others also denied the rumors of unrest in the Southwest. Regarding the issue of Chairman Hu's burial place, they said that it has not yet been decided. Luo Yiwei, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Guangdong River Management Committee, came north earlier to discuss the issue of dredging the Pearl River. He then returned south and took care of the funeral affairs of Hu Zhongxi. He also came to Shanghai on the ship yesterday. According to Luo, Mrs. Hu insisted on burying Hu's remains in Guangdong. Because Mrs. Hu wanted to see Hu's burial with her own eyes, but she was ill and could not bear the hardships of the trip, she insisted on burying him in Guangdong. Longyandong near Huanghuagang has now been selected as the burial site. Regarding the issue of dredging the Pearl River, the National Economic Commission sent water conservancy expert Pu Deliwan to inspect the south. He has also completed his work and returned north on the same ship. Dredging is necessary, but the funding is still to be discussed.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram to the National Government Regarding the Increase of Japanese Troops in North China and Smuggling Incidents</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday to the National Government's Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urgently request negotiations with Japan regarding the increase of troops in North China and smuggling incidents. The telegram read: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing: The increase of Japanese troops in North China and the protection of smuggling incidents has previously been the subject of telegrams from public organizations across the country requesting your esteemed Yuan and Ministry to initiate negotiations. However, these issues have not abated and have, in fact, worsened in recent days. Smuggled goods are rampant, and the market is in disarray. Japan is recklessly disregarding international treaties, and its intentions are clear to all. Furthermore, the Boxer Protocol allowed foreign troops to be stationed along the route from Beiping to the sea to protect the safety of the embassies, not to protect overseas Chinese. Now, Japan is misinterpreting the treaty and deploying troops outside the areas stipulated in the treaty, engaging in smuggling, obstructing our country's sovereignty, and undermining our country's finances. This is the most egregious thing. We hereby respectfully submit this to your esteemed Yuan and Ministry, earnestly requesting that you promptly initiate forceful negotiations and strive for our rights based on the treaty. This is extremely important. Respectfully, Wen Lanting, Acting Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bows." (Seal)</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association Sends Telegram</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, which read: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing: The recent large increase in Japanese troops in North China and rampant smuggling have caused great damage to national sovereignty and customs revenue. Upon investigation, the greatest excuse for Japan's troop increase in North China is the Boxer Protocol and the protection of overseas Chinese. In reality, the Boxer Protocol only allows each country to station a certain number of troops in Beiping and along the Ping-Feng Railway to protect the embassies and maintain traffic on the railway. Its purpose is limited to passive defense, and there is no need to station large numbers of troops. Now, the traffic to the Beiping embassies and the Ping-Feng Railway is in no danger whatsoever, so using this as an excuse must mean other intentions. As for the protection of overseas Chinese, the excuse is the threat from the communists, and they must increase troops to protect the overseas Chinese. However, after the communist bandits in Jin were suppressed by the government, they have been gradually eliminated, and our government has always fulfilled its responsibility to protect the overseas Chinese in North China. Using the protection of overseas Chinese as an excuse is extremely suspicious. As for smuggling incidents, since Zhu Hui's activities in August, the scope of smuggling has expanded even further. Government customs revenue has suffered a loss of over 30 million yuan in the last nine months. Moreover, the Japanese side condones and protects the smuggling activities of Japanese and Korean individuals, and uses the pretext of the Tanggu Agreement to obstruct customs' anti-smuggling efforts. Their intention is nothing more than to reduce our government's tax revenue, undermine the customs system, and gradually separate the customs administration of North China from the central government. Therefore, the increase of troops and smuggling incidents in North China are currently a major crisis. If effective countermeasures are not taken, the nation's sovereignty cannot be complete, and the independence of customs will be threatened. We especially telegram your esteemed (Yuan) (Ministry) to promptly lodge a strong protest again to achieve the purpose of withdrawing the stationed troops and stopping smuggling. Then the nation will be fortunate indeed. The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Association, bows." (Seal)</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Troops in North China and Protects Smuggling; All Sectors Telegram Requests for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, encouraging various industries and businesses to act with patriotic sincerity and a sense of urgency, to mutually abstain from purchasing and selling smuggled goods, so that smuggling would be eliminated through mutual support from top to bottom. (As previously reported by this newspaper) The telegram was immediately forwarded to various industries for their information. Currently, the cotton cloth, silk, velvet, and sugar paper industries are all affected by smuggling, and their business has sharply declined. In addition to requesting the City Chamber of Commerce to forward their requests to the government for prompt prevention, they are also actively taking measures to stop it. For example, the Sugar Industry Association is offering a reward of 500 yuan for confidential reports of smuggled sugar. The Electrical Machinery Silk Velvet Industry Association is sending personnel to inspect whether companies in the same industry are importing artificial silk. The Cotton Cloth, Satin, and Crepe Industry Association has notified its members to refuse to purchase smuggled goods. At the same time, state-owned factories hope that the government will promptly crack down on smuggling, and that the people will voluntarily abstain from purchasing smuggled goods. The following are excerpts of the telegrams:</p>
<h3>A Visitor from Hong Kong Discusses Zou Lu's Abrupt Departure Abroad</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports: "Central Committee member Zou Haibin, a central figure in the Guangdong Party and government institutions, suddenly left Guangdong to go abroad during the period of the public memorial for Chairman Hu, which has attracted attention from all parties. Mr. Zou had already accepted an invitation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference and was about to go to Europe, but this sudden departure was unexpected. I met a gentleman yesterday who had just come to Shanghai from Hong Kong and who saw Mr. Zou every day. He said that on the day after Zou left Guangdong, he sent a letter from Hong Kong to the military authorities, the content of which included something along the lines of, 'I have had over twenty years of friendship and cannot bear to see you fall for the foreigners' scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese, and make yourself a tool of their tyranny. Since my advice is not heeded, what is the point of staying?' This makes the reason for Zou's departure clear. The gentleman also said that Zou's luggage was hurriedly packed and that many of his friends in Guangdong were not informed beforehand. Even his travel expenses were not yet arranged, and he would have to find a solution after he went abroad."</p>
<h3>China National Industries Foreign Trade Association Hosts Banquet for Qiu Yuanrong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China National Industries Foreign Trade Association initiated a commercial inspection tour of Southeast Asia, uniting major factories to send personnel to conduct on-the-ground inspections in Southeast Asia, seeking the development of national products, bringing a large number of samples of national products, and cooperating with local Chinese chambers of commerce to hold grand exhibitions of national products. Letters have been received in succession from Surabaya, Singapore, Penang, Selangor, and other places, expressing their welcome and cooperation. Recently, Mr. Qiu Yuanrong, director of the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the Netherlands East Indies Overseas Chinese Importers Association, and standing committee member of the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee, came to Shanghai to inspect the situation. He took the opportunity to discuss exhibition methods with the inspection tour group. Yesterday afternoon, the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association hosted a banquet for Mr. Qiu at the New Asia Restaurant, with Wang Xingyao, Cai Shengbai, Ye Youcai, Zhang Huikang, and others in attendance. According to Mr. Qiu, the overseas Chinese merchants in Batavia raised a special fund of 2,000 guilders (approximately 8,000 yuan in national currency) last year for the purpose of organizing a national product exhibition. They invited manufacturers who had exhibited in Singapore to participate, but were unsuccessful. This time, they hope that more manufacturers will participate.

Although we have been promoting domestic products for many years, we still have a lot of ignorance about the situation overseas. You have worked hard in promoting domestic products in the United States, so we ask you to give us your valuable teachings on the actual situation so that we can learn from you. We hope that you will continue to work hard to strengthen the position of Chinese domestic products in the international market and to strengthen the foundation of national prosperity."

<h3>Survey of Dredging of the Pearl River: Pu Deli Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>He will Report to Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen Regarding the Collection of Additional Customs Duties as Funding, Which is Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Yu of the National Economic Council, due to the Guangdong province's plan to dredge the Pearl River, dispatched Luo Yiche, director of the River Management Committee, to Beijing to request assistance from the central government and to collect additional customs duties to finance the dredging. Considering that this matter concerns local construction, the central government dispatched Pu Deli, a water conservancy expert from the Economic Council, to Guangdong at the beginning of the month to survey the Pearl River's water flow and dredging project. Mr. Pu returned to Shanghai yesterday with Luo and others on the Ta Hutuo wheel. He will report to Kong Xiangxi and Zhu Ziwen, standing committee members of the Economic Council, on the survey. According to Luo, the collection of additional Guangdong customs duties to finance the dredging of the Pearl River still needs to be discussed with the central financial authorities. It is expected that this matter, which concerns national construction, will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren is in Shanghai for Treatment of Foot Ailment; Wang Luyi Comes to Shanghai for Instructions on Supervisory Yuan Affairs</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, came to Shanghai on the 3rd by car via the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway because of a severe foot ailment, so he could be treated more conveniently. According to those around Yu, the President's foot ailment is an old one that has recurred. This year, due to weather conditions, the swelling and pain are worse, making movement very inconvenient. He is still taking the medicine prescribed in Beijing, and has not sought medical treatment from other physicians or hospitals. This illness is a damp-heat condition (referred to as "foot qi" in the South), so moving to a different location for treatment may lead to a quicker recovery. It is difficult to determine when he will return to Beijing. Wang Luyi, Secretary-General of the Control Yuan, came to Shanghai on the 4th to ask for instructions from Yu regarding Control Yuan matters.</p>

After receiving the telegram, the company reported it to the insurance company and telegraphed the vessel for further details.</p>

<h3>Minister to the Netherlands, Jin Wensi, Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday, Will Return to His Hometown to Visit His Family Before Returning to His Post Abroad</h3>
<p>Our Minister to the Netherlands, Jin Wensi, has returned to the country to report on his duties and his leave is coming to an end.

<h3>Reasons for the Decline of the Cigarette Industry: Affected by Smuggled Paper</h3>
<p>In recent years, the cigarette industry in Shanghai has declined due to the impact of privately produced cigarettes. It has been found that the paper used for these illegal cigarettes is generally supplied by those who evade taxes and smuggle. It is transported from various ports and sold to the interior, reaching tens of thousands of boxes per month, resulting in significant losses in customs duties, tobacco leaf tax, and unified cigarette tax, estimated at 2-3 million yuan. The cigarette industry is the first to bear the brunt, and its business is even more depressed. Repeated requests to the government to strictly suppress smuggling have had some effect, but in recent months, the smuggling of cigarette paper has become even more rampant. All cigarette factories are in a state of fear and anxiety, hoping that the government will take effective measures to stop the smuggling of cigarette paper. The cigarette paper used by the official cigarette factories in Shanghai is purchased from various companies approved and registered with the tax authorities. The purchase procedure requires a firm certificate from the Cigarette Association and then a purchase permit from the tax authorities, which allows them to buy the amount on the permit. When manufacturing cigarettes, the amount of cigarette paper used and the number of cigarettes produced must be filled out on a daily basis and submitted to the resident factory staff for verification. The management is strict and the procedures are thorough, and it is impossible to purchase smuggled cigarette paper. It is hoped that the transportation of smuggled cigarette paper will be stopped to stabilize the industry.</p>
<h3>Shipping Guild Telegrams Request to Stop Foreign Vessels from Sailing to Lianyungang; British Taikoo Gansu Approved to Sail on the 7th</h3>
<p>Since Lianyungang was opened as a commercial port, products along the Longhai Railway have been exported through the port. The state-run China Merchants is solely responsible for the Longhai Railway joint transport of goods, and the private-run Hezhong Dazhen Shipping Company jointly handles the non-joint transport of goods on the Longhai Railway. In addition, the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company sends ships to transport the coal from the mine. Now, the British Taikoo Steam Navigation Company, given the sharp decline in cargo, has been forced to suspend the sailings of the Chengdu, Zhejiang, Gansu, Chongqing, and other ships that sailed between Guangdong, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Now it has sent the Gansu ship (2,000 tons gross) to sail the Shanghai-Lianyungang route, and it is approved to load cargo in Shanghai on the 7th and sail to Lianyungang. After hearing this, various private shipping companies believe that the sailing of the Gansu ship is damaging China's national shipping industry and have requested the Shanghai Shipping Guild to quickly telegraph the Ministry of Communications to stop it.</p>
<h3>National Maritime, Railway, Postal and Telecommunications Party Departments and Trade Unions: Petition in Nanjing the Other Day; Request to Add National Assembly Delegate Quotas for Special Trade Unions</h3>
<p>The national seafarers, railway, postal, and telecommunications special party departments, trade unions, and societies, requesting the addition of National Assembly delegate quotas for special trade unions, were first initiated by the Pinghan Railway, followed by the China Seamen's Special Party Department and Trade Union, the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Department, and the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Trade Union, which jointly decided in Shanghai to send a telegram to the national seafarers and railway special party departments and various types of trade unions, to jointly petition in Nanjing. On the Shanghai side, organizations that joined enthusiastically included the National Postal Workers' General Union, the National Postal Employees' General Association, and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, all of which agreed. On June 4th, they gathered in the capital, Nanjing, to petition the central government and relevant departments of the National Government. They arrived in advance on June 3rd and set up a liaison office at the Nanjing branch of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Union at Xiaguan Station. Those present at the time included Hu Qi and Zhu Donglin, representatives of the China Seamen's Party Department; Li Dasan, Wang Weiduan, and Yang Youren, representatives of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Party Department; Liu Wensong, representative of the Pinghan Railway Party Department; Liu Xi, representative of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Party Department; Duan Jianmin, representative of the Zhengtai Railway Party Department; Xu Shaodun, representative of the Jiaoji Railway Party Department; Yu Zhida, Cheng Zhuang, Ji Ruisen, and Xu Youyun, representatives of the Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, and Hankou districts of the Seamen's Party Department; Wang Yalen and Li Jianbai, representatives of the China Seamen's Union; Zhao [blank] and [blank] Renfu, representatives of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union; Xu Fu, representative of the Pinghan Railway Union; Xu Guozhi and Li Qingxi, representatives of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Union; Yuan Qiaofu and Zhang Yunhe, representatives of the Nanxun Railway Union; Gan Shusheng, representative of the National Postal Workers' General Union; Guo Dewei and Li Wenhuan, representatives of the National Postal Employees' General Association; Zhang Yi-Yi and Deng Shien, representatives of the Nanjing Postal Workers' Union; Jiang Jiade, representative of the Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Workers' Union; He Yongcheng, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the National Telecommunications Workers' Federation; Mao Yuyi, Zhu Xiaodong, Fan Yunqi, and He Jiaobing, representatives of the Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou branches of the Seamen's Association; and Liu Chengbing, Zhang Binghua, and Deng Rusheng, representatives of various societies, totaling more than forty people.</p>
<p>Decision-Making Methods</p>
<p>After the representatives arrived, they held a discussion meeting at the Nanjing branch of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Union at 3 PM on June 3rd. They elected Wang Yalen, representative of the Seamen's Union, as chairman, and Yang Youren, representative of the Railway Party Department, and Li Jianbai, representative of the Seamen's Union, as recorders. It was decided to petition the Central Executive Committee, the Central Department of Mass Training, the Central Organization Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior on June 4th. In addition to the separate petitions submitted by each trade union, the participating representatives jointly submitted a petition. Liu Xi, Li Jianbai, Zhao Shusheng, and He Yongcheng were designated to draft the joint petition. Li Qingxi and Liu Xi were designated as the leaders during the petition. Liu Wensong, Li Dasan, Zhang Yunhe, Wang Yalen, Zhao Shusheng, Li Jianbai, He Yongcheng, and Xu Shaodun were designated as spokespersons for the petition. Each representative was responsible for their own meals and travel expenses, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Union was responsible for handling the petition arrangements. It was decided that the departure point for the petition would be at the Nanjing branch of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Union at 8 AM on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>In the National Assembly Delegate Election Law, there are no provisions for the number of delegates from special trade unions such as railways, maritime, postal, and telecommunications. Special trade unions were first advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and their organizations are well-established, with a large number of members. They have fought for the revolution for many years and have made significant contributions. Now that constitutional government is being implemented, it is difficult for special workers across the country to remain silent if special trade unions are excluded from the National Assembly. In addition to requesting that the National Assembly Delegate Election Law be revised and that the number of delegates from special trade unions be included, we jointly dispatch representatives to present the situation in person, respectfully requesting an audience and prompt adoption and implementation to respect public opinion and legal benefits. We are sincerely grateful. Respectfully submitted, etc.</p>
<p>Separate Petitions</p>
<p>Representatives of various agencies and organizations gathered at Xiaguan at 8 PM on the 4th. They hired four-person carts to first petition the Central Party Headquarters. It happened that the Central Committee was holding a regular meeting. Zhou [blank] Fo, Minister of the Department of Mass Training, was designated to receive them. The petition representatives designated Liu Wensong and other seven people to present their petition. Minister Zhou accepted it. They then went to the Ministry of Interior, where Cai Peizhen, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, received them and promised to forward their petition to Minister Jiang. In the afternoon, the representatives continued to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan, where they were received by senior officials.</p>

<h3>Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Celebrations: Medical Association Begins Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's fundraising efforts to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday have been enthusiastically supported by all walks of life since the start of the campaign. The Shanghai Medical Association has also begun organizing a donation team since June 1st and has sent notices to all members. The notice states: "Respected colleagues, since the city initiated the purchase of aircraft for birthday celebrations, all public organizations have enthusiastically participated. We recently received a letter from the Aeronautical Association hoping that our association would raise a large sum to exclusively donate an aircraft named 'Physician.' Although this is almost an ideal, our colleagues have limited abilities and it is difficult to achieve in a short time. However, we must still try our best to fulfill our responsibility as a citizen. Therefore, the fifth executive committee meeting decided to organize a fundraising team to start soliciting donations from June 1st for a period of two weeks. All our members are requested to generously donate to support this grand event. The team leaders will visit each member to collect donations. We hereby notify you in advance and request your attention. The names of the fundraising team leaders are as follows: Medical Team!

<h3>Party and National Flag Promotion Group Begins District-Based Publicity Today; City Government Transmits a Letter to the Concession Authorities for Assistance Based on the Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Party and Government agencies and various groups organized the Shanghai Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee to implement the unified promotion of the national flag, they have been actively working hard.

Eight people, including Wang Yunqing, Yao Weiru, Yu Yuqing, Zhu Kunshan, Zhang Naixian, Shen Zhaoxiong, Yao Puchang, and Mo Peiqin, serve as group leaders and first promote the flags in the six districts of Ximen, +Liupu, Caojiadu, Zhabei, the City Center, and Xinzha, according to the areas of the Public Security Bureau. The Taxpaying Chinese Association and the Citizens' United Association are responsible for promoting the flags in the First and Second Special Districts, and are now starting to do so. The committee had requested the Municipal Government to send letters to the concession authorities for assistance, which has been approved, and the Municipal Government has sent the letters to the concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Announces Outline for Reorganizing Private Shipping Industry; Association Holds Meeting and Divides into Two Groups to Discuss Implementation; Shipowners Hope for Ways to Recover Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Long Feipeng, Acting Minister of Communications, convened a special meeting with various private shipping companies at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau in Shanghai on the 16th of last month. After drafting an outline, the ministry has promulgated it, totaling eight articles, stipulating various implementation methods: 1. Conducting ship registration; 2. Reorganizing scheduled routes; 3. Promoting shipping cooperation; 4. Purchasing new ships; 5. Rewarding the construction of new ships and the demolition of old ships; 6. Adjusting sailing schedules; 7. Supervising freight rates and ticket prices; 8. Supervising operations. The ministry order was received by the shipping companies at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Deliberating on Implementation</p>
<p>After receiving the ministry order, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association immediately distributed the outline for reorganizing the private shipping industry to the shipping companies and convened a meeting with the shipping companies to discuss implementation methods. Companies such as Sanbei and Ningshao participated. At the meeting, it was decided to divide the companies into two groups: scheduled routes and unscheduled routes, and to hold further meetings to comprehensively regulate the industry. Shipping companies with scheduled routes are the scheduled group representatives, and shipping companies with unscheduled routes are the unscheduled group representatives, and conveners were designated.</p>
<p>Group-Based Handling</p>
<p>The unscheduled route group and the scheduled route group have successively held meetings at the Shipping Club, convened by the conveners, to invite various scheduled and unscheduled shipping companies to discuss specific implementation measures.

<h3>Telephone Problem Committee Sends Letter to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Collect Evidence for Transferring the Letter to Chinese Directors for Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Respected colleagues, we previously received a letter from the Taxpaying Chinese Association of the Public Settlement regarding the negotiation of the telephone price increase in the special district, stating that it is necessary to collect evidence and review whether the company's income exceeds 10% in order to propose negotiations. In addition to notifying users to quickly report new price payment bills and inaccurate counts exceeding the number of times (Special District Telephone Problem Committee inside the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge), the number of reports received so far is small and cannot be used to verify whether the company's income exceeds 10%. Therefore, according to Item 2 of the conditions attached to the Shanghai Telephone Company price increase method passed by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, in accordance with the contract signed by the company and the Public Works Department, if the income exceeds one point, the company should waive half of the excess amount. Item 3: All company expenses should be reduced as much as possible. Item 4: If future income exceeds one point, the Public Works Department should immediately convene the Board of Directors to discuss reducing telephone charges. In order to facilitate the collection of user documents, we are sending this letter to your association, informing all industry associations and instructing members to send telephone bills to our association for forwarding to the Taxpaying Chinese Association to request the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department to seriously negotiate and re-discuss reducing telephone charges. As it concerns the vital interests of merchants and people, we hope that you will grant our request to facilitate the process. Looking forward to your reply."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Control Committee Replies: Suppressing Cocoon Prices is Clearly Unjustifiable; Sampling and Testing Have Refuted the Association's Earlier Request; Silk Improvement Committee Replies That It Has Been Forwarded for Verification and Handling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Association telegraphed the National Economic Council, the Silk Improvement Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Control Committee, requesting the prompt release of the seized and prohibited spring cocoons. Replies have been received successively: The National Economic Council and the Silk Improvement Committee replied: "We have learned of the matter. Please consider the difficulties of the merchants and request the Zhejiang Province to return the low-priced spring cocoons. We have already sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and handle this matter. Please be informed. Special reply." The Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Control Committee replied: "We have learned of the matter. The standard price for fresh cocoons this year was previously approved by the Provincial Government and distributed for compliance. Currently, many cocoon firms in various places are purchasing spring cocoons at prices much lower than the central price, which is clearly seeking unjustifiable profits and deliberately suppressing prices. How can they use occasional changes in the overseas silk market as a cover-up afterward? As for the size of the cocoon reeling, it originally varied in different places. Our association has separately sampled and tested reeling, and is striving to complete it as soon as possible. In short, our association's control and management of cocoon purchasing is originally intended to balance the interests of farmers and merchants. Secondly, we cannot allow merchants to harm farmers in order to gain a false reputation for leniency. The request should not be discussed. Please be informed." The Zhejiang Provincial Government replied: "We have learned of the matter. We have already ordered the Zhejiang Eastern Silk Cocoon Control Committee to quickly release the shipments, and according to the signed reply, we have already instructed the cocoon purchasing offices in various places to comply. Please be informed."</p>

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Funds Well Drilling for Hebei Farmers</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road has always focused on construction and disaster relief. The disaster prevention work it has organized over the years, such as road construction, dike repairs, river dredging, well drilling, and fundraising, has been effective and highly praised by society. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, the commission realized that droughts occurred frequently in the provinces of North China, causing great losses. Therefore, it proposed the idea of drilling wells for irrigation. Liang Mengting, the former president of the commission, and the American Red Cross assisted with a large amount of funds to serve as a foundation. Over the past fifteen years, more than 400,000 yuan has been lent to farmers in Hebei and Shandong provinces to drill wells. A total of 5,727 wells have been completed. Each well can irrigate 16 mu of land, which can irrigate more than 90,000 mu of farmland. Recently, farmers in 21 counties of Hebei have again borrowed money from the commission to drill wells. It is reported that loans have been selectively disbursed and the remainder are under review.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting Sues Zhang Zheng Case; Zhang Bofang Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zheng Chengqing Went to Japan Under Official Order, to Appear in Court Next Time; Zhang Bofang Admitted Notification but Denied Extortion; Chen Zhibei and Pei Yunqing Testified to What They Heard and Saw; Zhang Ordered to Submit a 10,000 Yuan Guarantee to Prevent Escape</p>
<p>Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing, colluded with the chamber in April of this year to dismiss staff member Zhang Bofang, forged a document in the name of the City Chamber of Commerce to conduct an investigation, and falsely signed the name of Chairman Yu Zuoting, falsely accusing Zhang Rongchu, the general manager of the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, that the raw materials for the party and national flags produced by the factory were Japanese goods, attempting to extort 50,000 yuan. Zhang Rongchu clarified the truth with Chairman Yu, reported Zhang, and the National Government secretly investigated and confirmed the truth. The actions of Zheng and Zhang were deemed to have violated Article 210 of the Criminal Law for forging documents and Article 313 for damaging credit. Therefore, Chairman Yu Zuoting of the City Chamber of Commerce, representing the City Chamber of Commerce, hired lawyer Yuan Hanyun to file a self-complaint against Zheng and Zhang to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The Special Court had already conducted a trial on the 29th of last month, but both defendants claimed illness and did not appear, so the court ordered a rescheduled hearing. These details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday at 2 PM, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in Criminal Court One.</p>
<p>Zheng Chengqing Absent</p>
<p>According to his lawyer, Zheng was in Qingdao for health reasons, but now his family claims that Zheng has gone to Japan and cannot appear in court. Only Zhang Bofang and his defense lawyer appeared in court. Zhang Bofang testified that he is 37 years old and currently the manager of Zhonghe Chemical Soap Company. Three years ago, he was an investigator in the Business Section of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce. Zheng Chengqing is his brother-in-law. In July 1934, Zhang Rongchu, introduced by Mr. Wang Xiaolai, joined Zhonghe Soap Company as a shareholder with 5,000 yuan. At that time, Zhang issued a check, but it could not be cashed when due and remains unpaid to this day. In March of this year, Zheng Chengqing mentioned to me that there were many criticisms from the outside world regarding the raw materials of the party and national flags produced by the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, secretly informing the chamber that the raw materials were Japanese "84 cloth" from the Japanese company Dongmian Yanghang. He said that he had been ordered by Chairman Yu to investigate secretly. Upon hearing this, I</p>
<p>Notified Zhang Rongchu Out of Friendship on March 17th to allow him to prepare and to take this opportunity to urge him to pay the unpaid shares, etc. Judge Jiang then questioned Zhang Bofang, saying that according to the wording in the two letters, there was no mention of urging the payment of shares, only references to Zhang Rongchu using Japanese goods and needing to smooth things over with Zheng Chengqing, etc. Also, was the forged document from the City Chamber of Commerce taken by you? Zhang replied that he took it on April 16th. He said that he initially did not know that the document was forged. He saw it on Zheng's desk at home and took it to Huaxinglong in Tianjin Road to show Zhang for review to prove its authenticity. Unexpectedly, Zhang refused to return it, saying that since the document was in his hands, he could only apologize. However, he did not mention at that time that the matter had been escalated and that he should smooth things over with Mr. Wang and Luo, nor did he extort 50,000 yuan. He claimed ignorance regarding the forging of the document and the false signing of Chairman Yu's name. According to Zhang Rongchu,</p>
<p>The Unpaid Shares are Indeed True, but Zhang Bofang first came and asked me to smooth over the issue of Japanese goods with Zheng Chengqing. I refused because the products of our factory are all domestic goods and can be inspected at any time. On April 16th, Zhang came again with the document and demanded 50,000 yuan. At that time, I was talking with Mr. Zhang Zilian inside, and Chen Zhibei and Chen Zhixin came to visit me, so they all heard and saw it. Then, witness Chen Zhibei testified that he worked at the Party and National Flag Production and Sales Headquarters at 18 Taiwan Road. On April 16th, at Zhang Rongchu's place, he heard Zhang and Zhang arguing, so he went inside. He only heard Zhang Rongchu say to Zhang, "In these times, your City Chamber of Commerce still wants to</p>
<p>Extort 50,000 Yuan." At that time, Zhang immediately wanted to take back the document, but Zhang refused, hence the argument. Witness Pei Yunqing testified that he lives at Tongsheng Money Shop on Tianjin Road and is currently a supervisor at the City Chamber of Commerce. After this incident occurred, he summoned Zhang Rongchu, Zheng Chengqing, and Zhang Bofang for a conversation on April 22nd and 23rd at the chamber. Zhang's wording at the time was similar to what he said today, while Zheng Chengqing directly admitted to falsely signing and said he needed 50,000 yuan to smooth things over. He then truthfully reported this to the Executive Committee. Yu Zuoting testified that he was completely unaware of this matter before it occurred. Zheng Chengqing had never mentioned it to him until Zhang Rongchu called him to inquire, at which point he learned about it. Judge Jiang then ordered that the case be rescheduled to be heard again at 2 PM on the 12th of this month. Zhang Bofang is suspected of a major crime and there is a risk of him fleeing, so he is ordered to submit a 10,000 yuan guarantee. Zheng's defense lawyer is also ordered to notify Zheng Chengqing to appear in court next time, or else an arrest warrant will be issued.</p>

A portrait was hung in the center, decorated with flowers. A sacrificial table was placed in front, with a spirit tablet and vegetable offerings. The ground was covered with wreaths from various circles. The coffin was placed behind the curtain. The body was dressed in the mortuary and the funeral was held at 10 AM. The ceremony followed the customs of the basic hometown. Madam Hu and her sons and daughters were in attendance, weeping sadly. After the ceremony, the memorial service was held immediately.</p>
<p>Burial in Autumn. Hu's coffin will be temporarily placed in Shed C of the funeral home and will be transported back to his hometown of Yin County for burial in the autumn. It is said that Hu's conduct was pure and he was especially charitable. Therefore, his funeral is simple, and Hu's friends are discussing the aftermath. The date of the memorial service has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Condolence Telegram from Kong and Wu. Minister Kong, who was in Beijing, received the news of Hu's death and sent a telegram of condolence. The original telegram reads: "To Madam Hu, I was shocked to hear of Mr. Mengjia's passing. I hope you will restrain your grief and take care of the important matters. I send this telegram of condolence." Wu Dingchang seconded. Colleagues from the Central, Communications, and other branch offices in various locations also sent telegrams of condolence.</p>
<p>Condolence Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Council. Hu served as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years from 1930 to 1934, and also served as a member of the Public Utilities Committee and the Security Committee, serving the community. Both Chinese and foreigners admired him. Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, sent a letter to Madam Hu in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, expressing his deep condolences.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Assault and Murder of a Patrolman by Vagrants at the Xiqin Institute; Iron Bars and Files Used in the Attack; Principal Offender Escaped, Others Recaptured</h3>
<p>At 4:20 AM on the morning of the 4th, patrolman Lu Yecai was murdered at the Xiqin Institute for Vagrants in Caohongjing Town, Shanghai, after being lured into a room by vagrants Yao Benren and others. The three murderers escaped over the wall. The details are as follows: The institute is run by various charitable organizations in Shanghai and houses about 800 vagrants, most of whom are unemployed or addicted to vices and were sent by their families for confinement. The original term was one year, but it has been changed to three years. The director of the institute, Wu Tang, usually educates and cultivates the vagrants, and his work has been successful. The patrolmen in the institute are well-trained and guard the institute day and night. However, at 4:20 AM on the morning of the 4th, someone in room 29 of the East Dormitory of the institute (occupied by six people, including Wu Xianlin from Suzhou, Yao Benren from Shanghai, Gao Shuiling, Gao Fuxiang, Pan Koushou from Taixing, and Hong Jianfu from Zhejiang, all sent by their families) suddenly called for a patrolman. Lu Yecai went to investigate and saw that someone was digging a hole to escape. Lu opened the lock and entered the room. Unexpectedly, the vagrants, including Wu Xianlin, used a blanket to cover Lu's head to prevent him from making noise, and then used pre-prepared iron bars and files to strike and stab him, causing his head to be broken and blood to gush out. Seriously injured, he fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, Wu and others took the key from Lu's body, opened rooms 24, 27, 28, 30, and 4, released more than 20 vagrants, broke through the side door, and fled north. At this time, patrolman Lu Zijun outside had already noticed and blew the whistle. All the patrolmen heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the leaders, Yao Benren, Wu Ruilin, and Gao Yongling, had already escaped over the wall. The others were recaptured. The injured patrolman Lu Yecai was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but he died in the hospital at 11 AM due to the severity of his injuries. Director Wu sent staff member Pu Hanping to take care of the situation. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Xiao, appointed by the local court, arrived at the scene to conduct an examination, confirming that the death was caused by assault. The body was handed over to the victim's sister, Cui Lu, for burial, pending investigation. The murderers, Pan Koushou, Gao Fuxiang, and Hong Jianfu, were handed over to the Caohongjing Police Station along with the iron bars and files for further investigation by the court. The deceased was 27 years old, from Hefei, Anhui. He joined the institute in the winter of 1924. His parents are still in his hometown and he was not yet married. He was the only son of his family and his family is very poor. His tragic death in the line of duty is truly pitiful.</p>
<h3>Wang Shubao Cries Injustice in the Shooting of Ji Zhongtang; Witnesses Testify He is Not the Owner of the Xiang Stage; Official Orders Further Investigation Due to Lack of Evidence</h3>
<p>Wang Shubao, the owner of the Xiang Stage, was implicated in the shooting death of Ji Zhongtang, a detective who was dismissed during the Shanghai War of 1932. After handbills were distributed, the prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court filed a public prosecution. Judge Wu Deying held a hearing yesterday afternoon. Ji Wu, the wife of the victim, testified that she is 40 years old, from Yancheng, and lives in a shack next to the railway bridge on Dayang Bridge. Her husband, Ji Zhongtang, was killed in Zhangjia Lane during the January 28th Incident. At that time, her aunt Ji Chen filed a complaint. She now seeks justice. Ji Chen, 65 years old, from Yancheng, and resident of 9 Shunxingli testified that her nephew Ji Zhongtang was killed on the afternoon of May 4, 1932, in Wei Cui's teahouse in Zhangjia Lane. Zhang Xiaowanzi reported the death. Zhang Xiaowanzi told her that the murderers were Wang Sanshizi, Zheng Xiaoheizi, and Wang Shubao, who shot him with handguns because her nephew had been a detective and had arrested Wang and Zheng. Zhang Xiaowanzi had pointed out a Wang Shubao at the Xiang Stage, but it was not the current Wang Shubao. The real Wang Shubao had a longer face, was fatter, and was younger. To find out the truth, she needed to ask Zhang Xiaowanzi. Zhang Xiaowanzi, also known as Zhang Xiaowuzi, 30 years old, from Yancheng, a performer, and resident of 14 Zhangjia Lane, testified that Ji Zhongtang was his teacher. He did not know Wang Shubao. That day, a Wang Shubao, along with his disciples Sanshizi and Zheng Xiaoheizi, killed Ji Zhongtang for revenge. The murderer Wang Shubao was from the north and had pockmarks on his face. He had seen him at the Xiang Stage at the time and wanted to report him to the Japanese headquarters, but they escaped. It was not the current Wang Shubao, etc. Wang Shubao testified that he is 48 years old and owns the Xiang Stage theater. He did not know Ji Zhongtang, Wang Sanshizi, or Zheng Xiaoheizi. During the Japanese occupation in 1932, the Japanese military headquarters was near the Xiang Stage. He was not living in Zhabei at the time. During that time, a group of outlaws acted lawlessly, killing and arsoning, doing all kinds of evil. If anyone can prove that he had ever walked in Zhangjia Lane at that time, he would be willing to be shot. He was falsely accused. Wei Cui, 49 years old, from Yancheng, who used to run a teahouse, testified that Ji Zhongtang was killed in her shop. The owner of the Xiang Stage was not among the murderers at the time. The official stated that the case had no leads and ordered further investigation before further consideration. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Beach Bathing Area to Open Tomorrow; Unique Architecture and Novel Equipment</h3>
<p>Since the Gaoqiao Beach Bathing Area in this city was taken back by the municipal government last year and jointly operated by the Municipal Industry and Trust Bureau and the Municipal Ferry Administration, all equipment has been completely renewed. Last summer, it was very popular among tourists, who praised it as the newest and most perfect seawater bathing area. The area is still not sleeping on its laurels and has added various new facilities this year: (1) Construction of an open-air shower area. The area already has a large men's and women's shower room, equipped with many hot and cold water shower heads for tourists to rinse off. To facilitate tourists, a large concrete open-air shower area has been built behind the beach on the grass behind the cool room area. The shower area is uniquely built with a concrete fountain column in the center, surrounded by four mermaid statues with shower heads in their mouths, connected to the water tower to spray clean water. Tourists can rinse off nearby after bathing in the sea. It is surrounded by Ningbo yellow sand, which can be used for resting and sunbathing. It is currently under construction and will be completed soon. (2) Additional cool rooms. Last year, the area had many temporary cool rooms with beds, curtains, bedding, etc., which could be used for accommodation at very low prices. Therefore, last summer, tourists rented them in advance every weekend and holiday. This year, the area has rebuilt 20 permanent cool rooms with more exquisite construction and equipment than last year. (3) Increase the planting of trees and flowers. This year, the area has purchased more than 1,000 saplings of various trees, such as plane trees and maple trees, and hundreds of plants of water peaches, flat peaches, peach trees, wisteria, and various flowers from the Zhenru Huang's animal husbandry farm, planting them throughout the area. A lotus pond has been newly built in front of the cool room, interspersed with various red and white lotuses to embellish the scenery and increase the interest of tourists. (4) Added a lifeboat for rescue. (5) Rental of rubber mermaids. The area has custom-made dozens of rubber mermaids of various styles from Austria, which are novel in style and convenient to use, specially prepared for those who do not know how to swim to learn. These rubber mermaids have not been seen in Shanghai and are the first time in China. It is heard that the area will be fully opened on the 7th of this month, as the weather has been getting hotter in recent days and there are many tourists. All kinds of meals and cold drinks will still be handled by the Waterfront Hotel.</p>
<h3>Treatment Issues Unresolved Yesterday After Thirteen Fish Businesses Entered the Venue</h3>
<p>After the persuasion of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, Shengji and other thirteen ice-fresh fish businesses decided to join the fish market for cooperation. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the board of directors of the fish market held a special meeting in the Zhonghui Bank building. Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Kuai Yanfang, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shenzhi, Yu Zuoting, and General Manager Wang Xiaolai attended. Du Yuesheng presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussion, it was agreed that the thirteen fish businesses could join. The service fee was originally 2%, with 1/4 collected by the market and all the workers in each business paid by the market. Now, the market will no longer collect the 1/4 and each business will handle its own workers, but they must pay a handling fee of 1/4 of the 2% for unloading. The eight businesses that joined earlier can be exempted from this handling fee first. This handling fee will be allocated to Shengji and other thirteen businesses in the future based on the amount of business of each business. This method is slightly different and they request equal treatment. No agreement was reached, so it was decided to hold another meeting to discuss the solution.</p>

<h3>Axe Murder and Gun Kill Over Eight Yuan Debt; Tea House Gathering Leads to Serious Case; Ji Shilin Dies</h3>
<p>At around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, a gang gathered at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road in the French Concession. The police dispatched patrolman Sun Qiwan, number 76, to investigate. The gang members attacked with axes, and Sun shot and killed one person. The details of the tragedy are as follows:</p>
<p>Female Lender Pawns Gold Ring</p>
<p>Gao Aji (also known as Gao Gengsheng), 46 years old, from Suzhou, lives at 8 Runde South Lane, Laguna Road (Huanghe Road) in the French Concession, specializes in lending money, and is married to Ms. Chen, 44 years old. On April 28 of last year, Ji Amao (nicknamed Xiao Chongming), a rogue living at 24 Lanxin Lane, Bai'er Road, borrowed a gold ring from Ms. Chen, pledging eight yuan, promising to return it on time.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Debt Resolution</p>
<p>Later, Ji was imprisoned for committing a crime in a smuggling case, so Ms. Chen's gold ring was never returned. Recently, Ms. Chen heard that Ji had been released from prison and repeatedly demanded repayment from Ji to no avail. Ms. Chen invited her tenant, Chen Zuoan, a local, 39 years old, to reason with Ji the day before, but to no avail. Ji even insulted Ms. Chen at her home and arranged to meet at the Yongyihe Tea House, 54-58 Huanghe Road, at 2 PM yesterday for a discussion.</p>
<p>Patrolman Faces Gang</p>
<p>At around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, Ms. Wu Chen and Chen Chanyun arrived at the Yihe Tea House to wait. Chen reported to the French police beforehand as a precaution. The police ordered Patrolman Sun Qiwan, number 76, to investigate. Soon, Xiao Chongming also led his elder brother, Ji Shilin (nicknamed Blind Man, 32 years old, currently working as a coal carter at Yangjing Pier No. 1), and many other gang members, who swarmed in, creating a turbulent situation. Before they could say a few words, the gang members were holding benches and chairs, intending to fight.</p>
<p>Axes and Guns</p>
<p>Patrolman Sun Qiwan felt that the situation was not good and immediately stood up to stop them. Ji Shilin, Xiao Chongming's elder brother, mistakenly thought that Sun was a friend of Ms. Chen who had come to help, so Xiao Chongming took out an axe and Ji Shilin raised a stool and hit Sun. In a moment of desperation and for self-defense, Sun took out his gun to try to stop the violence. Unexpectedly, Ji showed no fear. It was not until the police whistle rang loudly downstairs that Ji and others ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Ji Shilin Killed by Bullet</p>
<p>Sun chased downstairs, confident that he would capture the gang. As he chased west to the entrance of Xiangxing Tailor Shop at 8 Jiaqin Road, the handgun in Sun's hand suddenly fired, and a bullet was ejected, hitting Ji Shilin in the left back, piercing his chest, and killing him instantly. Ji Amao stopped when he saw his elder brother fall to the ground. Sun immediately took Ji and Ms. Chen into the police station.</p>
<p>Sun Detained</p>
<p>The police were notified and immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign patrolmen, along with Ji Amao and Chen, to the scene to investigate in detail. They notified the Renfu Branch to send officers to take the body to the morgue, pending inspection by the Second Special District Court. The other parties involved, including Sun, were detained, pending transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Heroism of British Youth, Philman; Rescues Japanese Woman Who Jumped into River</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at about 11 PM on Thursday (the 15th), a Japanese woman jumped into the Huangpu River from the Waibaidu Bridge Park, apparently intending to commit suicide. A young Englishman, Philman, not yet 20 years old, was sitting a few feet away, talking with two companions. Upon hearing the cries, he ran to the riverbank to look. The tide was rapid, and in an instant, the woman disappeared into the darkness, her life in danger. Seeing this situation, Philman quickly took off his coat and jumped into the river, fighting the tide. After a while, he swam the woman to the shore. Many people had gathered on the shore and quickly helped to pull the woman out of the water. The woman was young and already unconscious. She was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Philman, who lives at 1050 Apartment, Yu Garden Road, had received drowning training, so he was not hurt after entering the water. His heroic act is commendable.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I am writing to you in response to two news items published in your newspaper on June 4 regarding the female corpse who committed suicide by poisoning at Pushan Hospital. The statements made therein are completely inconsistent with the facts. Ma Xingzhen had already stopped working and left the factory two months ago, and the male worker Yu He Gua did not abuse her in any way. Furthermore, Yu Zhuting is not a hooligan, but the brother of our factory owner and a legitimate businessman. The suicide of Ma Xingzhen was caused by a quarrel between husband and wife. The report in your newspaper does not conform to the facts and is likely based on inaccurate rumors. This matter concerns the reputation of our factory, and we respectfully request that you correct the record.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Chongfu Silk Weaving Factory</p>
<p>June 5th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the article published in your newspaper on June 2 about the foundry factories preparing a meeting due to labor costs and raw material prices, we find that it does not conform to the facts. The workers' collective strike was actually due to the arrest of Ni Lunian, a worker at the Guanji Factory, for a criminal offense. The workers of various factories then went on strike together. Furthermore, the trade association is still in the process of being organized and has not yet received a permit from the Municipal Party Department. There has been no preparatory committee established, and the claim that Fan and An were appointed as directors of the preparatory committee is completely untrue. We believe that the Xinsheng News Agency has provided inaccurate information and request that you correct the record to reflect the true facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sang Zhigui, Lou Shuangbao, Dai Senlin, and Fan Guoan</p>
<p>Founders of the Shanghai Foundry Trade Association</p>
<p>June 5th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in your newspaper on June 4 concerning Xu Wancheng issuing a special publication criticizing the local court and Zhao, the prosecutor, considering it libel and requesting the president of the court to summon him for questioning. The article vaguely mentions bribery by Zhao, the prosecutor, of the Shanghai Local Court. There are several prosecutors named Zhao in the court, including Zhao Yongzhou and Zhao Yuesheng. There are also similar-sounding names like Shao Qinzhi and Cao Baozhen. According to Xu Wancheng's publication, the president of the court, Luo Tong, was also involved in bribery. Therefore, the claim is that Prosecutor Zhao was summoned for questioning. Since I began serving, I have been committed to honesty and integrity and have tried to reverse the decline in morality. My work in Tianjin, Koubei, Wuchang, Northern Hubei, Nanjing, Huangpi, Shousi, Fuyang, Hefei, and other places is well known. I was recently transferred to the Shanghai court, where I hoped to work with my colleagues to be pioneers in recovering consular jurisdiction in our country. This is my sincere desire and can be witnessed by heaven and earth. Unexpectedly, I have been affected by defamatory language. Since I came to the court, I have never handled any case involving Xu Wancheng. The president of the court has not questioned me about it. The name Cao is a level tone, while Zhao is a falling tone. How can it be said that the names are similar? Is this an insinuation? Please publish a correction regarding the news of the court president questioning me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cao Baozhen, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court</p>

<h3>The Hardware Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the Chinese WeChat</p>
<p>(Excerpt 27 from the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview)</p>
<p>In recent years, the hardware business has been relatively good compared to other industries, although it has been affected by social instability. However, competition among businesses is fierce, resulting in lower profits than in the past.</p>
<p>The hardware manufacturing factories in this city can be divided into nail factories, steel factories, copper sheet factories, and hardware parts factories. These are listed below.</p>
<p>Nail Factories</p>
<p>The larger nail factories in Shanghai are Gongqin on Linqing Road, Wangfu on Binye Road, and China on Funing Road. There are also five or six smaller factories. Since Chinese-owned nail factories have taken over, imported raw nails have gradually declined.</p>
<p>Steel Factories</p>
<p>The manufacture of steel bars in Shanghai is only about three years old, with Xinxinghe Factory being the earliest. Cheng Factory is the successor to the former Heyu Factory and is located in Qingdong. Xingye Factory followed, opening last year at Pingliang Road. Production volume increases or decreases depending on sales.</p>
<p>Copper Sheet Factories</p>
<p>There are several copper sheet manufacturers in the city, including China on Yuezhou Road, Zhonghua on Zhenren Road, Hexing on Ningwu Road, Nan on Yu Yuhui Road, and Qixing Factory on Diwei Road. All specialize in the manufacture of copper sheet, except for the China Factory, which also manufactures copper wire. Among them, the China Copper Factory was established earlier, about five or six years ago. The other factories were established in the last four or five years. The various secret copper sheets produced by each factory are mostly sold to factories in this province and less to other ports. Since domestically produced copper has been supplied to the market, imports have decreased year by year.</p>
<p>Hardware Parts Factories</p>
<p>The so-called hardware parts factories cover a wide range, such as knives, saws, locks, hinges, chains, water taps, etc., all of which are their products. The scale of the factories is mostly small, and some also engage in machine manufacturing. Among them, there are currently three door lock manufacturers: the hardware department of Kangyuan Can Factory, the Metal Products Factory, and the Jiading Cooperative Hardware Company. All three are imitating Western-style spring-loaded door locks, and exports are good. They are sold locally and in other ports, inevitably impacting foreign goods.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government established the Central Machinery Factory in Beixinjing. It is said that it will soon begin manufacturing pipes, iron sheets, copper and iron bars, etc. The scope is quite large, and when it officially ships its goods for sale, it will be a major force against imported goods.

<h3>Teachers' Day and Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>The boisterous Children's Day on April 4th has not long passed, and the grand Teachers' Day is here again. We know why there is a Children's Day because the 20th century is a century in which the women's rights movement has led to the expansion of children's rights. Ms. Ellen Key simply called it the "Century of the Child". Since this entire century belongs to children, then this entire century is about improving children's lives, spying on children's happiness, and promoting children's causes. "Children's Year" and "Children's Day" are all about valuing children and encouraging everyone to promote children's causes so that every child will become a good citizen and strengthen the nation in the future.</p>
<p>While "Children's Day" is important, "Teachers' Day" seems even more important because teachers cultivate and educate children, and their words and deeds can affect the future of children. Celebrating Teachers' Day is simply to encourage our teachers to be more motivated and work harder. As for how to be a teacher, Mr. Yu Ziyi put it well: the first requirement for being a teacher is like a plum blossom. The plum is the earliest flower to bloom in the world and can represent a spirit of "foresight". The second is to be like a holly, which does not wither in winter and is evergreen. The third is to be like an old child, that is, a teacher must have mature insights but also possess the innocence of a child. How to be a teacher? Be like a plum, like a holly, and like an old child.</p>

<h3>Chengzhong School Achievement Exhibition: Arithmetic Teaching Aids Design</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Chengzhong Middle School Achievement Exhibition on Tangshan Road. The thousands of charts, models, and specimens from various subjects were exquisitely drawn and widely selected. The arithmetic teacher Chen Yuesheng's design of more than eighty arithmetic wall charts and more than twenty teaching aids were novel and rare, and of particular value. It is found that teaching arithmetic in middle schools is often troubled by the time-consuming nature of writing and drawing on the blackboard, the unsanitary nature of flying chalk dust, and the glare that disturbs the line of sight, which cannot be avoided. Chen's creation not only eliminates the above-mentioned drawbacks but also makes full use of suitable colors and clever arrangements, clearly expressing each step, each system, each principle, and each method, allowing people to understand its meaning at a glance, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. It is truly a powerful tool for arithmetic teaching methods.</p>
<h3>June 6th: Caries Prevention Day</h3>
<p>Caries is closely related to children's health. Governments and health education experts in the East and West attach great importance to it and stipulate a certain day of each year as Caries Prevention Day to promote it and directly promote the attention of children's parents. Li Xinfu, director of the Children's Dental Hospital of the Family Industry Society, and Chen Chaozheng, chief physician, etc., in view of this, have specifically designated June 6th of this year as the first Caries Prevention Day in the country, in order to arouse the attention of the people and enable children to enjoy health and happiness. It is reported that on that day, the hospital will conduct all consultations from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, without collecting medical fees, and there will be gifts. However, in order to avoid crowding, it is limited to 200 people. The next day, Sunday, will continue for one day, but it is only limited to oral examinations, also limited to 200 people. It is reported that adults are afraid of being too crowded, so the consultation will be suspended for two days.</p>

<h3>World Games Track and Field Preliminaries: Sprint Tests Today at Shen Garden: Ten People Tested in Three Events, Total of Five Names Selected: Qualified Athletes from the Training Class Granted Exemption from Testing</h3>
<p>The selection of track and field team members for our country's participation in the World Games has been scheduled to take place tomorrow at Shen Garden, where they will compete against the West Alliance team to observe each person's performance and posture to seriously select official representatives. A total of 56 men and 9 women from the men's training class, totaling 65 people, will participate in the preliminaries. After the selection committee reviewed the athletes who registered for the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter events, it found that many of them did not meet the association's announced qualification standards for participating in the World Games preliminaries. However, in order to promote the younger generation, it was decided that except for those who had passed the test results in the Ping training class, the rest must hold a test competition at Shen Garden at 3:00 pm today to determine the team members attending tomorrow. The number of people selected for the three events is decided as follows: (1) 100 meters: 2 people; (2) 200 meters: 2 people; (3) 400 meters: 1 person.</p>
<p>The following athletes must be on time to participate in the competition. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Mingliang, Ma Gulun, Cheng Jinguan, Zhang Jiakui, Ye Songping, Chen Yongfu, Fu Jincheng, Yan Zhaoshen, Li Yanxiang, Zhu Aixian. Other athletes who have registered to participate in other events, although they also have unqualified results, but there is no actual conflict, the selection committee approved them to join the competition together.</p>
<p>From 1:00 pm today, you can collect the number cloth and athlete badge from the association office.</p>
<h3>Ma Yuehan Talks About: It is Still Too Early for Women to Participate in the World Games</h3>
<p>Ma Yuehan, the person in charge of track and field training guidance and selection, has arrived in Shanghai from Ping. According to him, the original plan was for 12 track and field representatives to participate in the World Games, but due to economic constraints, it is not yet certain whether the number of places will be increased. As for the selection criteria, it will be based on performance, character, age, whether they can continue to practice in the future, and the promotion of sports. The representatives going this time do not expect to score points. I personally advocate that each representative participating in the event must observe the situation during the competition and report in detail on the postures of excellent athletes in order to improve. As for women's sports, I have always strongly promoted them, but in view of the results and the lack of proper protection of physiology, participating in the World Games seems too early. Also, after the closing of the World Games in the future, I will go to Europe and the United States with Dong Shouyi and Song Junfu to conduct on-site investigations on sports. As for the Li Huitang incident, which concerns national dignity, I advocate strict investigation.</p>

<h3>The Football Committee Enforces the Law Impartially: Fudan and Railway Teams Deprived of Competition Rights: Each Had Two Players Suspended from Next Season's Competition: The Railway Team was Warned and Fined One Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Football Committee held a meeting at the Dentoumo Hotel at 7:00 pm the night before last (the 4th). Committee members Jiang Xiangqing, He Chunhui, Ma Detai, and Le Xiurong attended, with Zhang Le (referee) attending as an observer. Jiang Xiangqing chaired the meeting, and Shi Zhaokang and Zhang Huiqing were the secretaries. The reporting matters (omitted). The discussion matters were the dispute in the Chinese Character Group final between the Fudan and Railway teams. During the discussion, the chairman asked Mr. Zhang Le to leave, and at the same time, because Committee Member He had a relationship with the Railway team, for the convenience of both the committee itself and Committee Member He privately, the chairman also asked him to temporarily leave. Then, based on the registration of responsibility (the committee believes that the reports and protests of the two parties involved and the records in the newspapers should not be used as legal bases), a detailed study was conducted for three hours. The resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Players from both the Fudan and Railway teams used force. The right to compete this season is suspended, and the Chinese Character Group is not awarded a championship.</p>
<p>(2) Liu Zuxiu of Fudan and Yang Shengwu of Railway, who first used force, are suspended from competition for one season next season. Li Chuanxin of Railway and Chen Shixi of Fudan, who continued to use force, are suspended from their right to compete until December 31, 1936.</p>
<p>(4) After the unfortunate incident occurred, the Fudan team remained on the field to demand a continuation of the game, while the Railway team was unwilling to continue the game and left the field immediately. Also, during the dispute, the cheering staff of the Railway team poured into the field, making it impossible for the referee to exercise his powers, which was wrong. According to Articles A and B of Article 8 of the Association's Charter, the Railway team is given a written warning and fined one yuan to warn against the future.</p>
<p>The above resolutions were agreed upon by Committee Members Jiang, Le, and Ma, accounting for a majority of the five committee members. After the discussion, the chairman asked Committee Member He to resume his seat and reported the results. Everyone agreed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Jiang Lianggui to Study in Germany</h3>
<p>Jiang Lianggui, director of the undergraduate department of the East Asia Sports College, is a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang. He graduated from the Department of Physical Education of the College of Education of the National Central University and holds a Bachelor of Education degree.

<p>Special Issue of the National Children's Painting Exhibition</p>
<h3>Improvement of Art Education</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>—Opening Remarks—</p>
<p>The National Children's Painting Exhibition, prepared halfway and containing tens of thousands of works, opens today amid enthusiastic support from the whole country! Gathering children's art works from all over the country in one hall, and judged by national art education experts, its significance is not only in the exhibition. Looking at the outline of the exhibition's measures, what is announced to us at the beginning is that the purpose of holding the exhibition is to improve art education. Then, after the exhibition, how should we base ourselves on the results of the evaluation, distinguish the location of the good and bad, and study the future improvements to complete the mission of the exhibition? Gongzhan is not talented, dare to express his thoughts on education in order to correct the worthies,</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the improvement of art education lies in integrating art and education into one. The purpose of art education is not only to cultivate skills, but also to focus on the cultivation of emotions. Therefore, teaching art, in addition to the skills of art itself, will have a greater effect; conversely, if you only have educational knowledge and no artistic cultivation, the failure will be unavoidable. Knowing this, let us observe the teachers of art education today, how many people can have both artistic cultivation and educational knowledge? Art schools only know how to cultivate painting experts, and normal schools only know how to cultivate educational talents. Therefore, art teachers either have artistic cultivation and no educational knowledge, or they have educational knowledge and no artistic cultivation. Art and education do not interact with each other, creating a phenomenon of separation and division. Therefore, the so-called art is in an inevitable state of failure. From now on, if we want to seek improvement in art education, then how to cultivate teachers who integrate art and education is the primary plan. I humbly believe that if graduates of art schools need to undertake art education tasks, they must be instilled with educational knowledge while in school; if graduates of normal schools need to undertake art education tasks, they must learn artistic skills while in school. Only then will both parties be taken care of, with no bias. The art education teachers will be sound, and the improvement of art education will be successful. I hope that all those who value art education in the country will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Children and Art</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>A naive child is like a blank piece of silk; the silk can be dyed into dazzling colors, and it can be woven into splendid and gorgeous brocade. Receiving dazzling colors and weaving splendid brocade are inherent to the nature and personality of silk; however, human intervention is indispensable. In other words, children can be cultivated into the backbone of the nation, and they can be nurtured into citizens who create the era. These backbones of the nation and citizens of the era are inherent to the instincts and personalities of children; however, education and training are indispensable. Once we understand this point, then we should pay close attention to the process of education and training of children's instincts and personalities – because white silk can be dyed red, and it can also be dyed black, and at the same time, pure children can be cultivated into citizens who create the era, and they can also become depraved and become inferior elements of the nation.</p>
<p>The importance of education for children is as described above, and the scope of education is broad and the methods are numerous. Some emphasize the use of the brain, which is called intellectual education; some emphasize labor, which is called vocational education; but these intellectual and vocational education methods are felt to be dull and boring, and are not the education needed and suitable for children. What is suitable and needed for children is interesting education that uses both hands and brains. Painting art is a good education that uses both hands and brains and is full of interest. Therefore, teaching art to children is not aimed at creating artists, but at giving all children the opportunity to approach art, cultivate their aesthetic inspiration, stimulate their aesthetic instincts, lay a good foundation for education, cultivate citizens who create the era, give all children the opportunity to beautify themselves, appreciate the beauty of the universe, receive aesthetic influence, improve the character of the nation, and cultivate a noble and peaceful national spirit.</p>
<p>The relationship between children and art has been roughly discussed above. Now, the purpose of art will be explained from the perspective of children.</p>
<p>All phenomena in nature contain beautiful components. Children have an innate ability to love beauty. They spontaneously exhibit mental activities and expressions towards beautiful things. This kind of expression is the child's interest. When children come into contact with beautiful scenery and develop an interest, all their unpleasant emotions can disappear invisibly, increasing their interest in appreciating beauty. By enabling children to understand the methods of appreciation and gain experience in appreciating beauty, they will develop an aesthetic interest in other beautiful objects as well. This gradually enriches children's interests, makes their moods gradually more pleasant, and promotes the gradual development of their intellect and body, achieving their most complete aspirations. This is the cultivation of children's interest through art.</p>
<p>The emergence of interest is due to the attraction of beauty, but the acceptance of the attraction of beauty is also due to children's innate aesthetic sense. The function of aesthetic sense is that human organs come into contact with beautiful objects, appreciate the beauty contained in the objects, and aesthetic activities occur in the mind. This is what is called interest. Since children have an innate ability to love beauty, they naturally have the rise of aesthetic sense. Human sensory organs either advance or retreat. Art can train children's sensory organs, temper children's aesthetic instincts, and at the same time, children's innate aesthetic sense, because they are often exposed to a noble and beautiful environment, can also be subtly purified and become noble, so that it will not degenerate or corrupt. This is the way art can cultivate children's aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>Human personality is also an innate quality. Children's personalities are mostly innocent and unrestrained. They are very subjective in their own judgments. They feel a rich and satisfying interest in their own published works. This valuable personality can be used to take advantage of the opportunity of art to promote and develop their strengths, and at the same time, can correct their weaknesses, and guide children's personality onto the right track, so as to avoid excessive indulgence, which is difficult to transform. This is how art can develop children's personality.</p>
<p>Human beings are always dissatisfied with their inherent environment and always have the intention of improving it. This kind of improvement is creativity, and it is also a valuable instinct of human beings. In childhood, we should arouse the motivation for artistic creation, so that children can freely express and create, so that children's creative instincts can be specially developed. In addition, we can use children's eyesight to appreciate works of art, their skills to create works of art, and their brainpower to study works of art, so that children's hands, eyes, and brains can be used at the same time and develop evenly.</p>
<p>We understand the close relationship between art and children. We recognize that childhood is the most important and promising period in life. During this period, we should lay a good foundation for education. Although there are many methods, the transformative power of art is the deepest. Therefore, for children as white as silk, we can use the function of art to educate and train them, creating the backbone of the nation and cultivating the citizens of the era.</p>

<h3>The Preparation Process of the National Children's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>The National Children's Painting Exhibition is a first of its kind in China. After nearly five months of preparation, it has opened today under the attention of the whole country. The preparation process over these five months is worth reporting to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The main purpose of holding this exhibition is to study and promote children's painting, inspire children's creativity, and seek improvement in art education.</p>
<p>The initiator of this exhibition was the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. Because the exhibition was held in Shanghai, it entrusted the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the China Child Welfare Association, the China Art Education Society, the Shanghai Municipal Children's Implementation Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Children's Happiness Committee to be responsible for the preparation. Each of these organizations and societies selected representatives to form a preparatory committee to preside over the work.</p>
<p>The preparatory committee was established on January 20th of this year, and the first meeting was held on the same day to assign various duties and begin planning the work of the association. The initial task was to engage in the drafting of various laws and regulations, because this was the basis for the work of the association. In addition to the outline of methods issued by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, there were also detailed rules for solicitation, key points for solicitation, simple rules for the judging committee, product review standards, product judging standards, painting performance methods, product award methods, method of collecting prizes, method of collecting works by painters, method of collecting art education treatises, product review methods, product display methods, visitor guidelines, painting performance award methods, and more than ten other types, all of which were successively approved by the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>After the various laws, regulations and rules were formulated, they were announced at any time, and submitted to the Ministry of Education to notify all provinces and cities to comply. At the same time, the collection of entries began. From February 10 to May 10, nearly 50,000 entries were received from more than 20 provinces and cities. The exhibits were rich and beautiful, which made us very fortunate.</p>
<p>In addition to collecting children's works as the main body of the collection, in order to fully demonstrate the significance of the exhibition, we also solicited works from artists and treatises from educators across the country. The purpose of soliciting works from artists was to provide children with appreciation and observation to arouse their interest. The purpose of soliciting treatises from educators was to collect opinions from all parties for the research of people across the country and seek improvement in art education.</p>
<p>Because of this, in this exhibition hall, in addition to children's works, there are also painter's works displayed in it, which can be said to be one of the new features of this exhibition. As for art education treatises, because visitors cannot read them carefully in a short period of time, they are no longer displayed, but are directly sent to newspapers as special edition materials. If funds permit, they will be published as special books afterwards for people across the country to discuss.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to observe the style of foreign children, we also solicited works from schools established by foreigners in Shanghai. With the assistance of the Chinese Education Office of the Public Concession, children of many nationalities actually participated in the exhibition. Therefore, we also opened a foreign children's exhibition hall for visitors to refer to. This is also another feature of this exhibition.</p>
<p>However, the features are not limited to this. In order to test children's ability to wield a brush for guests, we also held children's painting performances during the exhibition. We formulated methods in advance and solicited children to participate. There were more than 160 people in total, and even Chahar, which is located in a remote border area, came from thousands of miles away, which should make us so fortunate!</p>
<p>Looking at the success of this exhibition, it is really the result of collective efforts. Although the results may not be entirely satisfactory, the government's promotion and the support of the society are enough to make us feel excited. It is only a pity that my colleagues are unable to do everything, and there are still some shortcomings in the handling, which can only be said in an old saying, please forgive everyone.</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Children's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Yu Jifan</p>
<p>Children's paintings can also be said to be free paintings. Paintings such as model copies that have no creative meaning are definitely not children's paintings. It is only when children rely on their own strength to write out what floats in their hearts or what they see that they can be said to be children's paintings. This kind of painting naturally has a creative meaning and can satisfy the child's aesthetic impulse.</p>
<p>It must be known that only paintings that can satisfy their own aesthetic impulses have creativity, have great subjective joy, and become beautiful art. The so-called "beauty" lies entirely in being able to thoroughly satisfy the impulses of the individual, and there is no other standard to seek. And the paintings depicted by children, if based on theory, are nothing more than the expression of a certain impulse. For example, because there is an impulse or desire to obtain loquats in the heart, loquats are depicted on paper or walls. However, the impulse and desire for "eating" is not limited to loquats, so sometimes it is depicted to other fruits. And when depicting, only satisfying the impulse of "eating" is the main focus, and it is absolutely not bound by the form of the picture (color, composition, etc.). In other words, the rules that adults abide by when depicting are absolutely unimaginable to children.</p>
<p>The main purpose of art education is to make children express themselves. Furthermore, development can only be sought in terms of satisfying impulses. And it must be made to thoroughly satisfy them. The so-called thoroughness is the satisfaction of everything subjective to each individual.</p>
<p>The pictures that elementary school first-grade children depict that are sincerely satisfying, although they may not be very interesting to adults, can indeed be said to be beautiful art with original meaning from the child's point of view. Therefore, children's paintings cannot be judged according to adult standards, and teachers cannot guide children when they are depicting paintings.</p>
<p>Although it is said that there should be no guidance, it is not complete laissez-faire. Teachers should have appropriate designs when children are depicting paintings. And the so-called design is not to guide children (for example, how to depict, or should not depict like this, etc.) but to think of ways to make children's impulses thoroughly satisfied, and it can also be said to encourage children to satisfy their own impulses. As for giving children advice, hints, discussions, and references, it is difficult to solve this problem. This problem depends entirely on the children themselves to solve.</p>
<p>Therefore, the meaning lies in making free painting the center of children's painting. To put it simply, the foundation of painting education should be based on children's interests, and the starting point should be the children's own depiction.</p>
<p>During the review period of this national children's painting exhibition, I saw the exhibits from various provinces. There were really not many that could be called "children's paintings", and the most were either using children's handwriting to depict the teacher's ideas, or the teacher imitating the children's interests and modifying the picture. For this reason, I wrote this short article, hoping that teachers can first understand the true meaning of children's paintings and engage in painting education to seek the upward development of children's paintings.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the National Children's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The National Children's Painting Exhibition, jointly organized by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, has opened today in the central area of Shanghai. During the preparation period, Chen was appointed as one of the judging committee members and reviewed the entries participated in by schools in various places. I feel that in general, China's art education has made significant progress. For children's painting alone, whether in terms of content or technique, although not every piece meets the purpose and principles of the solicitation, there are many works that, judged according to children's psychology, do have creativity. Their depictions are inherently naive and clumsy, but they reveal a humorous, light, lively and simple mood, which is clearly different from the works of adults. Although they imitate, they do not seek to be reborn or exactly like, but only use imitation as a tool to express their views on things. And they are absolutely not subject to any constraints or strictly abide by the rules, so the paintings they depict only seek to express the meaning and not the likeness, and become a deformed thing, but they express their free and unique personality everywhere. If we give this free and unique personality good and effective training, it is not difficult to fully develop great talents. The so-called good and effective training is art education. Therefore, the last of the main points of this National Children's Painting Exhibition is to improve art education, which shows the importance of art education. At this time of national crisis, art education needs special attention and importance. For example, war is an inevitable fact in human history, and it is of great importance to the survival of the country, and the people of the whole country should not ignore it. But in fact, most adults are still dreaming and have no feeling for the war. On the contrary, in the unspoiled innocence of children, driven by patriotism, military supplies such as airplanes, warships, machine guns, broadswords, etc. are regarded as supreme good subjects. Their identification is sometimes more complete than that of adults, and if there is an international relationship in ten war paintings, their painting situation is entirely that I win and people lose, and I survive and enemies die. This is such a valuable and noteworthy thing. The importance of the construction of various material aspects in the revival of a nation is of course beyond doubt, but this kind of spiritual and psychological construction is a prerequisite and must not be ignored. Cultivating this patriotic enthusiasm and making it fully developed will make the country strong and the nation revived. Then, not only will the ultimate goal of the painting exhibition be achieved, but also a part of the purpose and mission of painting will be achieved here.</p>

<h3>Securities - Uncertain Environment - Government Bonds See Heavy Selling Pressure Again - This Month's "Wu" Issue Suffers the Steepest Decline - Bullish Efforts Slightly Recover the Market After Hours</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was rife with rumors again. Sharp fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate caused widespread panic, and the eager selling was driven by the financial sector. The sold bonds were all from the current month, indicating that they were all holding actual bonds. The bulls on the market had to temporarily avoid the pressure. The situation was particularly bad in the morning, with the "Wu" issue falling the most sharply. The bulls repeatedly tried to remove the minimum price limit. Therefore, it is now hoped that the outflow of actual bonds will help the market recover. However, the bull's defenses have been built up excessively, leading to over-expansion. If they are released, their rapid decline would be difficult to control.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading saw the "Wu" issue being sold off heavily by trader number 47 at the opening, leading to a selling frenzy. Traders numbers 35 and 78 also engaged in selling. On the buying side, only a few retail investors were covering short positions. The market price plummeted by more than half a yuan. In the second session, the "Wu" issue was slightly sold by number 54, causing a further drop of over half a yuan. Subsequently, numbers 4 and 11 bought aggressively, driving the price up again. As a result, various issues further down the list recovered by about one jiao. In the afternoon, the selling pressure eased slightly. Numbers 4 and 11 continued to raise prices, making strenuous buying efforts, and pushed the prices back up by five fen, one jiao to four jiao. Trading volume decreased at the close, the market situation was chaotic, with prices fluctuating up and down, ranging from five fen and one jiao to two jiao. The daily market price result was a slight decrease ranging from one jiao to six jiao and a half. The total turnover amounted to 6,030,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A comparative table of the results of the price increases and decreases is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth - Actual Sales are Active - Yarn Market's Decline Considerably Eases - Financial Sector's Long Positions Still Rolling Over Near-Term Futures</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning, and the situation appeared more calm. This was because current yarn sales remained healthy, with strong demand from Sichuan buyers and decent procurement from Yunnan buyers, slightly boosting market sentiment. However, most people still leaned towards a bearish outlook, as warehouses were full of yarn, and there was no hope for a large outflow of these cotton yarns in the short term. However, the financial sector was reportedly absorbing a significant amount of near-term rollover futures.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Brand Yarn Falls in the Morning but Recovers in the Afternoon: The opening of the forward yarn market was sluggish due to long positions rolling over from the previous day and weak buying sentiment. The price of imported cotton rose only moderately, and trading in the market was slow. Prices trended downward across all months, with far-dated futures breaking the 200 yuan level. Market commentators said that the atmosphere was unfavorable and unanimously leaned towards a bearish outlook. After the second session, the situation weakened considerably. As a result, all months fell by six or seven jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, after the market opened, the market sentiment remained depressed. However, later on, news circulated that spot yarn purchases were active in both Sichuan and Yunnan, and that raw cotton was tight. Short covering pushed prices up gradually. As a result, all months rose by three, four, five, and six jiao compared to the morning's closing price. It was found that 750 bales of Zhenda yarn were sold, 1400 bales of Mingde, 700 bales of Hexing, 450 bales of Senkang, 450 bales of Taichang, 2030 bales of Changfeng, 650 bales of Runkang, 500 bales of Jinghua, 400 bales of Yongchang, 650 bales of Renfeng, and 800 bales of Guangchang. 350 bales of Deda were bought, 800 bales of Chengji, 950 bales of Yuda, 450 bales of Tongji, 3400 bales of Gengfeng, 1000 bales of Shengyuan, 700 bales of Xincheng, 750 bales of Shenji, and 700 bales of Dachangcheng.

<h3>Rumors of Coarse Cotton Movement - Cotton Falls and Then Recovers</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose, and the trend was relatively tight. This was because current cotton demand from factories was strong, and purchasing from external factories was also developing, further boosting market sentiment. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that 20,000 dan of coarse cotton had been sold to the military outfitting department, which further boosted market sentiment.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Slightly Recovers in the Afternoon: The forward cotton market opened with US cotton rising two to ten points, Indian cotton rising 0.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Osaka's Three Grade cotton falling 2.3 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and all months fell by two jiao. Moreover, there were many discussions about the lack of a satisfactory solution for coarse cotton. The second session was uneventful. As a result, all months fell by five fen to one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the opening of each month was mixed, with fluctuations of five fen. Later on, it was heard that cotton factories were still actively purchasing, and both domestic and foreign factories had needs. Rumors circulated about large-scale movement of coarse cotton, further boosting market sentiment. As a result, all months rose by five fen to two jiao and a half compared to the morning's closing price. It was found that 1300 dan of Dafeng cotton were sold, 2200 dan of Taichang, 1300 dan of Yuan Yi Yi, 1100 dan of Yi Chang, 1300 dan of Changfeng, and 1800 dan of Xincheng. 900 dan of Tongji cotton were bought, 2600 dan of Juxing, 1800 dan of Yuda, 1700 dan of Dachangcheng, 1400 dan of Dafeng, 1300 dan of Renfeng, 1100 dan of Runkang, 1300 dan of Jinghua, 1000 dan of Xinhua, and 2200 dan of Yuanxingchang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Factories Procure Spot Cotton: Consumption of spot cotton is active, with both domestic and foreign merchants procuring it. The source is reported to be 210 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>US Cotton: Distant Months Rise, Near Months Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with positive news from Liverpool. However, due to selling from the Far East and the mainland, long positions were liquidated. Political instability in France and reports of rain in Alabama caused all months to fall by three to six points. Subsequently, industry players bought at limit prices, leading to partial recovery. The volume of hedging sales and long liquidations was absorbed by retail and speculative buying. However, scattered showers in the eastern region made buyers cautious. In the afternoon, industry players were indecisive. Brokers and short sellers bought actively, leading to a firm close. The spot and July contracts fell by three points, while the remaining months rose by two to eight points. English cotton fell by four points for spot and four to five points for futures. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases of new Baroach and Oomra cotton by European exporters, but then weakened due to the rise in silver coins and the liquidation of long positions. Speculators bought July and August Baroach and sold April and May Baroach. The net result was that Fullgood rose 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Oomra rose 0.75 to 1.75 rupees, and Baroach rose and fell 0.75 to 1 rupee. Original telegraph recorded left, (4th report).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Baroach cotton on the 5th was 212.5 rupees, up 1 rupee from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Private Estimates of US Cotton</h3>
<p>A New York dispatch on the 4th stated that Pannill released the current estimate, with production at 70.6% and cotton collection at 12,465,000 bales. The acreage for Babad cotton was 32,585,000 acres. The previous estimate (May 7th) for acreage was 32,140,000 acres.</p>
<h3>Three Grade Yarn and Cotton Slightly Fall</h3>

The largest buyers and sellers are excerpted below (unit: bales):</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Printed Piece Goods Sell Well in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market was affected by persistent rumors, continued depreciation of Guangdong-Guangxi currencies, and further deterioration of sales in Guangdong. Market sentiment was quite uneasy. Japanese firms were willing to sell off their holdings of fine cloth and fine twill for the current month at market prices. However, various parties remained cautious, and only a small number of offers were made, totaling approximately 300 pieces. There was still good buying interest in printed cotton piece goods from Hunan Province. Sales included various factory's printed plain silk fabrics, linen gauze, satin, printed cloth, foreign yarn, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill, totaling one hundred and several dozen pieces. Hubei merchants continued to ship one or two hundred pieces of lower-grade fine cloth from local factories and fine twill from various Changzhou dyeing and weaving factories, as well as Lanji brand fine cloth. However, colored goods were quite sluggish. Other goods in the market were able to hold steady.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Japanese and American Silk Prices Slightly Rebound - Lyons Suddenly Declares Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese and American silk prices both showed firmness. New York's 83-degree Japanese silk rebounded by 3 points, and 75-degree silk rebounded by 2 points.

The Lyons silk market suddenly declared weakness yesterday. Shanghai silk A-grade and B-grade etc., each load fell by 2 francs, and legal currency fell by about 25 yuan per load. Trading by foreign firms in Shanghai was as sluggish as usual. Only a little over a hundred lianas were bought yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Italian Rayon Purchases Strong from Hangzhou Buyers</h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of rayon has been rising daily, while the price of silk has not increased slightly. Therefore, the buying interest from silk factories is particularly weak. However, trading from Hangzhou buyers is particularly strong. Yesterday, they purchased another five cases of 120s Goldfish brand from Japanese and Italian firms at a price of 375 yuan. 344 cases of 120s No. 3, Sinee light-gloss filament, were priced at 90 yuan, excluding tax. The inventory of privately-held goods is very low, but there is no market. Currently, privately-held goods in North China are very difficult to sell, so prices have declined again. Tianjin's 120s Sky Bridge brand is priced at 171 yuan. One rumor says it has fallen to 140 yuan, Zhoucun is at over 240 yuan, and Gaoyang is at 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hua Bu Zhenmei Opened Yesterday - Qihong Exports Continue to be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market remained active. British firm Jardine Matheson continued to show strong buying interest in Qimen medium and low-grade black tea. Yesterday, few Tunxi Zhenmei were sold. Only Xiehe imported a single type of Ruifang Zhenmei at a price of 90 yuan. Few Chouxin Zhenmei were traded. Because of the dwindling inventory, Su'an Zhenmei prices remained stable. Hua Bu Zhenmei was opened by Fushi at a price of 66 yuan, similar to the old prices. Trading in local Zhenmei was even more sparse. Pingshui Pearl Tea prices were initially lowered at the opening. Various foreign firms received overseas telegrams complaining of high prices, so they also offered much lower prices. Although the goods are getting better, prices have not increased. After Jinlong and Xiehe moved the market on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, the market was still fluid, but the selling price was found to be gradually tightening. The highest price was about 57 or 58 yuan, the medium grade was 55 or 56 yuan, and the lowest grade was 53 or 54 yuan. Compared with the goods sold at the opening, prices seem to have fallen by several yuan. The report yesterday that pearl tea had risen by 3 or 4 yuan was a misreport. There were slight transactions in pearl tea yesterday. Yongfa bought over 100 pieces, Yongxing imported 70 pieces, and Doud bought over 60 pieces, with prices ranging from 53 to 55 yuan. In addition, a total of more than 4,700 boxes of black and green tea were traded throughout the city. Black tea was still the best from Zhidelu firms, with prices all stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Decreased Transactions in Guangdong Coarse White Label</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw flat sales and a stable trend. The Sugar Association's clearing prices for 24s coarse sand white spot and re-export goods were unchanged, and there were no transactions. East red white also saw little movement. Only 50 bags of spot No. 8 East White YT mark were traded at 21.4 yuan. The buying interest in domestically produced Chaozhou sugar remained weak because the Shantou exchange rate was rising. For brand goods, only a batch of Mianchi was offered, including 83 bags of Huaguang red at 12 yuan, over 100 bags of Thai red at 11.9 yuan, and several hundred bags of bag red at 11 yuan. In addition, over 30 bags of Xiaoyang white were sold at 12.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The term for the joint-stock company's closing yesterday was due, and the total quota for Guangdong coarse white was 7,057 bags. The listed price was unchanged, but the number of transactions decreased compared to Wednesday. The result was that 395 bags of Guangzhou Wuyang coarse white were sold at 21.8 yuan, Quxi another 10 bags at 21.8 yuan, City Central Sand 10 bags at 19.8 yuan, and No. 4 Mianbai 30 bags at 20.6 yuan. There were few other transactions.</p>

<h3>Grains - Short Covering Rebounds - Flour Initially Falls and Then Recovers, Ultimately Better Than the Previous Day by One or Two Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially appeared flat and soft after opening in the morning, but rebounded strongly in the afternoon. Prices for foreign wheat, reported from Chicago and Canada, rose by about three or four jiao. At the opening, although foreign wheat was reported higher, the weather in recent days was perceived to be good, so market sentiment was flat. Prices for each month fell by about one fen compared to the previous day, but trading was quiet and fluctuations were minimal. By the afternoon opening, some short positions covered due to persistent rumors of instability and recent long positions were holding steady. Some factory chips were also heard to be gradually covered, so market sentiment suddenly turned bullish, rising by about three fen compared to the morning and by one or two fen compared to the previous day. Given the current situation, in terms of weather and this year's wheat crop, a bullish outlook is not expected, but external shocks are cause for concern, so the future is difficult to predict for the time being.</p>
<h3>Rumors of New Nanjing Wheat Sales - Price at 3.8 Yuan - Standard Grades Lifted the Flour Market in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was generally listless and range-bound after the opening in the morning. Although foreign wheat was reported higher by three or four jiao, the clear and pleasant weather was welcome, so both buyers and sellers were mostly in a wait-and-see mode. Trading in each session was scarce, and price fluctuations were minimal. At the afternoon opening, it was still flat initially, but then rose by three or four fen in response to the bullish flour market. Market sentiment was also quite firm. As for this year's wheat crop, rumors say new Nanjing wheat has been sold at a price of 3.8 yuan. Wuxi and Suzhou are also expected to show samples and announce prices soon. According to industry insiders, a flood of supply is expected. If there are no unexpected changes, a flat or falling market is expected, otherwise it will depend on flour sales.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over twenty vendors still arrived with supplies, totaling over 6,000 shi of public goods. Sales on this street were still average. However, the Northern gangs bought over 1,000 bags each of high-quality Bo Dao and thick Jing, so the market was increasingly sluggish. Thick Zaojing prices fell by one jiao. Except for Gao Liao, Bo Dao were mostly priced at one jiao less than mid-grade goods. Du Yangjian also showed weakness, with Yinyuan falling by nearly one jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various river ports were plentiful, with about forty vendors arriving. Due to the increasingly hot weather, sellers wanted to unload their goods, but buyers only slightly purchased the freshest and cheapest goods, causing Baijing market prices to fall by slightly less than one jiao. Bo Dao was down by several fen. Yinyuan was slightly less than one jiao. Yangbu Kejian was stagnant, with prices reduced by six or seven fen. Other goods also showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Fujian Buyers Stop Buying Ke Xian - Continued Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market turned flat and soft again. The Fujian buyers stopped buying yesterday after several days of purchases. Furthermore, their buying interest was only strong on one day. From the second day onwards, there were no whole-ticket transactions, so market sentiment gradually softened. No deals opened throughout the city yesterday. Interior and Quanzhou vendors were also mostly in a wait-and-see mode. Only vendors on this street were making small, opportunistic deals. The market was difficult to stabilize. Yesterday, high and mid-grades continued to fall by several fen. If Ke Xian sales do not improve, prices may soften again. It was reported that 1,187 bags of Jiangxi rice, 569 bags of Taiwan rice, and 700 bags of Jiangbei rice were sold throughout the day, all bought by this street's vendors.</p>
<p>Grain Price Statistics for May (Continued from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Dried Goods - Xinghua Longan Production Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Xinghua longan prices had previously declined due to mixed-grade goods and expectations of a bumper harvest of new longans. Production prices had fallen by more than ten yuan, for example, from over 4 yuan to over 60 yuan. It was also rumored that new longans were already being sold at extremely low prices, so market sentiment was even more weak. However, a review found that the inventory of mixed-grade goods in the Shanghai market was gradually running out, and prices had slightly recovered. Furthermore, new Xinghua longans are not expected to arrive until mid-August, which is still far off, so the production prices of old Xinghua longans have gradually stabilized. However, the market is very sluggish for authentic grade 2 Xinghua longans due to high base prices. There is no official market price, and downstream prospects are worrying.</p>
<h3>Metals - Primary and Secondary Soldering Tin Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>The main buyers for soldering tin are the factories on this street. Recently, most factories on this street have reduced or stopped production, so sales have decreased significantly. In addition, there is a lot of mixed tin coming from Tianjin, so the selling price has not improved and is two or three yuan lower than before. For example, the primary grade is selling for 59 yuan per dan, and the secondary grade is selling for 54 yuan, but transactions are only sporadic.</p>
<h3>Authentic Grade Black Iron Sheet About to Run Out</h3>
<p>The inventory of 1 foot by 6 foot 18-gauge authentic grade black iron sheet is currently running out on the market. Arrivals have ceased, and the remaining inventory is very low, so the goods in circulation are extremely scarce. As a result, standard market prices are rising step by step. The current market price is 9.3 to 9.4 yuan per bundle, which is 2.5 jiao higher than before. According to general observations, the price of 9.5 to 9.6 yuan may be realized by the middle of next week.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Women's Supplement</p>
<h3>A Model New Woman</h3>
<p>— Yunqin</p>
<p>What I am about to describe is not someone of the same fame as Mrs. Nie or the Black-Clad Prime Minister's wife. Rather, it is a model in our modern women's world that I believe is rare and wonderful. She is my relative's neighbor, so I know all about her in detail. I admire and respect her immensely. I have written this without her permission, so please forgive me for not revealing her name.</p>
<p>She is a highly educated woman who married ten years ago. Her husband is very capable and agile. When he graduated from university, he wanted to study abroad, but he was unable to do so immediately due to financial constraints. He had to go out into society to earn a living. They already had children, and all expenses were unavoidable. But she was able to work hard and do everything herself. Her day was like a timetable. She saved the money she saved in order to fulfill her husband's wishes. This news was known to a close friend, who voluntarily offered to help them. (I heard that this friend is also very frugal, and is indeed their comrade.) So her husband was able to travel and study. It has been two years now. She is at home, educating her three children. Although she does not employ servants, her children's cleanliness is even better than those who have servants. She is able to guide them everywhere in accordance with family education. She also has a lot of medical knowledge and protects her children's health. They are all lively and healthy. How fortunate are children living in such an embrace! She wants to continue her studies after her husband returns home. The old saying "Where there's a will, there's a way" makes it is not difficult to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>If the women of our country could all be like this, bury themselves in hard work, and create a perfect family, we would have a strong nation. Two hundred million fellow women, at this time of national crisis, we must quickly rise up, do our part of the responsibility, and not fall behind!</p>
<h3>Small Families and Birth Control</h3>
<p>— Meizhen</p>
<p>This is indeed a major problem. Of course, women from middle-class and above families do not have to worry about "birth control." Because they can hire nannies to breastfeed, and the older children can be taken care of by servants. They don't have to worry about anything themselves.</p>
<p>So-called small families are those where both partners are committed to production, or at least the man works outside and the woman cooks and cleans at home. There are countless families like this in today's society. It's okay to have one child. It can increase family fun. But what if there are more children? On the one hand, the woman is busy, and the education of the children suffers. On the other hand, the man comes home from work tired and needs to be comforted in a quiet home. If there are too many children, it will be noisy, and the adults will be affected, which is enough to prevent family fun. I have more than a dozen friends who are almost all having one child a year. They feel unable to recover their health and are overwhelmed by the trouble of the children. The couples all feel great pain.</p>
<p>"Birth control" has become something that people hope for, but they don't know the secret. They can only sigh. I hope that the Women's Supplement can invite a reliable doctor to disclose knowledge about birth control on a regular basis. Don't focus on empty talk, focus on practicalities. I also hope that sisters who have gained the secrets of birth control can openly discuss them so that those who have missed out can gain enlightenment.</p>
<p>Of course, "birth control" is a social problem. In China, in a backward society everywhere, only we women can discuss and study it together.</p>
<h3>How to Breastfeed an Infant?</h3>
<p>— Yanzhi</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of breastfeeding, we must first study the mother's milk in detail, because the ingredients contained in mother's milk are best suited for the infant's digestion, and there is no danger of being too thick or accumulating. There is nothing more exquisite and healthy than mother's milk in the world. However, due to accidents, infants cannot obtain this natural food, so they have no choice but to find other foods to replace it.</p>
<p>Many women use cow's milk to feed infants. This is very inappropriate. Mothers and nurses with a little experience all know that infants cannot grow by eating cow's milk alone. We may as well compare cow's milk and human milk to understand.</p>
<p>A. Human milk is neutral, while cow's milk is acidic.</p>
<p>B. Human milk does not contain bacteria, while semi-milk contains countless bacteria.</p>
<p>C. The composition of human milk, if calculated as a percentage, contains 3.3% fat, 0.7% protein, 0.8% casein, and 7.0% lactose. Cow's milk contains 3.5% fat, 0.7% protein, 2.8% casein, and 5.0% lactose.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the difference between human milk and cow's milk is very large. Commonly diluting cow's milk with water to feed infants cannot really serve as a physiologically appropriate infant food.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are evaporated milk to replace cow's milk. There are three common types.</p>
<p>A. Contains cheese and added sugar.</p>
<p>B. Contains cheese but no added sugar.</p>
<p>C. The cheese has been removed. After all, its composition is also like cow's milk in general, and there is no food that can be called completely suitable for feeding infants under six months of age. As for those over six months of age, the first two types can be used as part of the infant's food. (Those with the cheese removed are still unsuitable).</p>
<p>There is also milk cake, which is often used to feed infants. Little do they know that infants under six months old actually do not easily digest powdered food. If forced to breastfeed, it is easy to cause illness. According to medical certification, infants over seven months old can be fed with powdered food.</p>
<p>Virtuous mothers, breastfeeding is a work that cannot be ignored, because the infant's health depends entirely on your attention to breastfeeding.</p>
<h3>Japan's Standard Wedding</h3>
<p>— A Snippet</p>
<p>Since our country implemented group weddings, they have not only become popular nationwide, but foreign newspapers have also praised them. Ever since photos of Shanghai's group weddings were published in Japanese newspapers, the traditionally frugal Japanese have greatly admired them. Recently, the Central Association for Improving Lifestyles in Japan formulated a standard wedding ceremony, which is expected to become popular soon.</p>
<p>Japanese wedding ceremonies involve many formalities, and the expense is no less than that of traditional Chinese weddings. There used to be a saying in Japan: "Having three daughters will wipe out your family fortune," which shows how extravagant they can be. They all held the old view that this was a once-in-a-lifetime event for their daughters and that they had to make her shine. Therefore, families with an annual income of around 2,000 yen often went into debt to cover the wedding expenses. Our country is now loudly proclaiming a time of national crisis, and Japan has designated this as an extraordinary period, warning themselves. This standard wedding is Japan's "extraordinary period" wedding, so the intention is even more profound.</p>
<p>According to their regulations, families in Japan with an annual income of 1,500 to 2,000 yen account for 70-80% of all families. The cost of marriage for these families should only be 30% of their annual income. That is, about 300 yen should be the standard wedding cost. The most expensive part of a wedding is clothing and decoration, accounting for about 70%. The remaining 30% is for ceremonies, social activities, and miscellaneous expenses. The Life Improvement Association surveyed department stores for the most appropriate trousseau items, from clothing, bedding, shoes, and socks to wardrobes and dressing tables, totaling about 220 yuan and only about twenty items. Originally, Japanese wedding gifts were not practical items. And after the host family received gifts from others, they still had to give equivalent return gifts. Now, the standard wedding decisively cancels the old custom of return gifts.</p>
<p>Japanese houses are small, so most people borrow restaurants, auditoriums, hotels, and shrines to hold Shinto or Buddhist weddings, which are more expensive. Therefore, the standard wedding has set the absolute condition of holding the wedding at the groom's home. The new couple holds the wedding ceremony in front of the Buddhist altar and ancestral shrine at home, which is considered the most meaningful. The number of guests invited is limited to 30, 20 at the groom's house and 10 at the bride's house. The guests at the groom's house are close relatives, friends, and colleagues. The bride's side includes relatives, friends, and teachers from school. The cost of the banquet for the guests is about 3.5 yuan per person. If the bride's side bears more than 30 yuan for the banquet, there are still 50 yuan for makeup, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses. In Japanese marriages, the groom's side only bears the banquet expenses and ceremony fees for relatives and friends. The burden is much lighter than the bride's side, so their standard wedding takes the bride's side as an example.</p>
<p>The improvement of marriage ceremonies aims to be solemn and less costly. Men are more in favor of it, while women mostly do not yet have a thorough understanding. Even our country's group weddings have not achieved the ideal popularity. Although there are complex reasons, the fact is that it is not uncommon for women to oppose and not participate. Therefore, whether these two new types of weddings in China and Japan can be popular may indicate which country's women have the courage to reform themselves.</p>
<h3>On Women</h3>
<p>— Wang Siying</p>
<p>The poet Milton called women "God's final masterpiece." Hegel praised them as "the crown of all existence." Duomei'er once sang that "women are the fragrance of all existence"; Lamajin named them "angels on earth!"</p>
<p>Women are spiritual vessels capable of expressing the highest beauty and greatest potential of personality. The ancient Greeks said that women are palaces for worshiping God because women are purely pure, fragrant, completely transcending the mundane, and encompassing all the fragrances of the mundane world! Therefore, promoting the beauty of women is promoting the beauty of God; and at the same time, it is also promoting the beauty of men. From this perspective, if there is no woman, there is no male morality!</p>
<p>Throughout history, many poets have almost believed that women are the incarnations of God's most beloved angels. Women are the light of life in the world. Where there are women, there is warm and harmonious light, and there is sweet, cheerful joy. Women are the only fragrance in the world!</p>
<p>Almost all literary works are about the beauty of women; otherwise, they are stories about love. The great German poet Goethe not only lived among women but also wrote "The Sorrows of Young Werther," which swept the world because of Lotte. The dramatic saint Shakespeare also wrote mostly plays about women: isn't "Romeo and Juliet" an example?</p>
<p>If we boldly say that the world is a woman's world, I'm afraid few people would object, right? Facts are the most eloquent: when the great thinker Marx was in love, he thought of Jenny day and night: even eating Parisian food didn't taste good, and seeing majestic mountains didn't seem high. It seemed like he was too lazy to attend classes at the University of Paris! If they hadn't "become a family in the end," that "Das Kapital" might not have been completed! Looking at the Roman general Caesar, during the period when he was captivated by Cleopatra, he abandoned his military achievements; he still coveted her plump body. You should know Chu Bawang, who commanded the wind and clouds and "whose strength could uproot mountains and whose spirit covered the world!" Before committing suicide in Wujiang, he still drank and danced with Consort Yu before dying! If saying "women are a source of trouble" is an expression of women's greatness; then that one smile topples a city, and another smile topples a country is by no means an insult to women. We see in history that King You of Zhou did not hesitate to light beacon fires to amuse the feudal lords for the sake of Bao Si's smile. Xishi's coquettishness made King Fuchai's heart fly to who knows where. Isn't all this saying that women have the power to stir up storms on the continent and change the world? However, the weapons used by women are not eloquent tongues to promote any doctrines or associations... but softening, gender policies.</p>
<p>I often hear some people scolding women as worth only a few pennies per pound? This is a fundamental mistake—the value of women, you need to know: cannot be exchanged for the six continents and five oceans!</p>
<p>Readers, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Don't Take Your Anger Out on the Children</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yunfang</p>
<p>Raising children is really a very difficult thing. Many children are not raised well, which is entirely the fault of the parents; even if the child is born with deficiencies or has physical defects, it is also the fault of the parents; but most parents do not study in advance, and when the child has a problem, they treat him as an experiment or a sacrifice, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Now I want to report on the matter of adults taking their anger out on children: In general, a person has joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures. With joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures, parents are most likely to take their anger out on their children at home. When happy, they are very kind to their children; when angry, they will take their anger out on their children. Once, the couple in the building behind my house had a quarrel (both are intellectuals). Less than half an hour later, their child caught a mantis in his hand and ran in happily. This child usually asks a lot of questions, and his mother needs to answer everything. This time he wanted to ask his mother again. As usual, this kind of good opportunity can be used to guide some common sense about mantises based on accidental events and current objects; but his mother was angry and picked up the unfinished shoe sole on the table and hit the child's face heavily, making him cry. That night, the child had a high fever due to excessive fright, and in less than two days, he died. Afterwards, I explained this matter to them, and they regretted it very much; but it was too late.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned fact of taking anger out on children can be said that no parent is free from this crime. Children have no ability to resist, and it is easy for parents to vent their anger on children. You are capricious, but the children suffer because of you. This is what we parents should take as a warning, and I especially hope that my sisters can pay special attention!</p>

<h3>The Mission of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhang Yili</p>
<p>Modern women have the mission of improving our own status. We should use our own strength to open up our own future, display our women's special abilities, and eliminate the social perception of women's inferiority. Therefore, we women should pay attention to the following ten points:</p>
<p>Be generous in demeanor. Exercise your physique. Learn practically. Have far-reaching insights. Have a bright heart. Have a clear mind. Think carefully. Behave with dignity. Dress simply. Serve quickly.</p>
<p>At the same time, we women should pay attention to the following ten prohibitions:</p>
<p>Do not buy foreign goods. Do not be a vase. Do not pursue vanity. Do not indulge in decoration. Do not underestimate yourself. Do not rely on men. Do not be timid and shy. Do not let men take the lead. Do not succumb to the social environment. Do not completely shirk the responsibility of transforming society to men.</p>
<h3>To Sister Fen, Staying in Nara, Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>——Second Letter——</p>
<p>Fen! Look! This matter has evolved to such a point, what method should be used to stop it from continuing to deteriorate? The most difficult thing is that the eldest sister herself is unwilling to divorce; even if she wants to file a lawsuit, the purpose is only to "request the maintenance of cohabitation obligations."</p>
<p>Although I am fortunate not to have personally experienced this kind of thing, what I have heard in my ears and seen in my eyes is indeed a lot; generally, modern people's interpretation of "freedom of love" is not yet clear, they only know to overthrow the old morality, but they do not know how to establish a new morality themselves, so the incident of lightheartedness emerges endlessly, and the most common is that people who have already succeeded in free love and have already married repeatedly fall in love with others.</p>
<p>Then how can we try to save it? Fortunately, I am currently an "unemployed vagrant" and have plenty of time; and I always believe that there is always a way, as long as you have time to think, no matter how difficult it is, you will always think of a good way. Therefore, I considered everything based on everything the eldest sister knew, as well as the situation of her brother-in-law and the status of the other party. The eldest sister has been taught my "ghost cleverness" since she was a child like you, so she waited quietly like a patient with a serious illness seeking medical treatment from a famous doctor, hoping that I could give her a prescription for "medicine to cure the disease."</p>
<p>Writing a prescription is not difficult, but it is not easy to treat the symptoms. I thought about it for a long time for the eldest sister, and I thought about four or five countermeasures again and again, but not only did the eldest sister feel useless, but I also felt too naive and ridiculous, so I abandoned them all; in the end, I came up with a wonderful method of "drawing firewood from under the cauldron." The so-called "cauldron" naturally refers to the brother-in-law, and the "firewood" is naturally that Ms. Liu. But how to draw it? Speaking of it, it is very funny and very straightforward.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I decided on a countermeasure, and I implemented it immediately in the afternoon; when Ms. Liu went home for dinner, I accompanied the eldest sister to see her straightforwardly, of course, I didn't say my real name when I first went in, and then I told her after I sat down. This trip was something she never expected, and I had already informed the eldest sister in advance that she was not allowed to show a trace of jealousy, and I pretended to be smiling, not like I was here to find fault; therefore, it made Ms. Liu feel very surprised and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The eldest sister first took out some love letters written to her by her brother-in-law when they were "swearing oaths of love" and gave them to Ms. Liu to read, asking her how similar the ones she received now were to these? Then she asked her if she could rely on a husband who was willing to abandon his wife who he had pursued and loved before and marry another woman? Could he guarantee that he would never do it again in the future?</p>
<p>When these two points were raised, Ms. Liu was ashamed and could not find a place to stand; the eldest sister then further told her about the economic situation of her brother-in-law in one breath, and used three pawn tickets as a conclusion. So Ms. Liu cried. The eldest sister and I comforted her and said that if she was willing to follow Xiao Ling's words, the eldest sister would be willing to take care of Fen voluntarily, guess what the result was? The brother-in-law got a bad name for being ungrateful for nothing, but lost a lover. The eldest sister added a close friend, and she is going to take Xiao Ling to the Liu family for dinner today!</p>
<p>I dare not be confident that this method will work every time, but I can say that it is at least much better than "crying," "beating," "scolding," "going to court," and so on!</p>
<p>Your couple is harmonious, so naturally there is no need to keep it for "reference"; it is just "a matter of concern for close relatives," so it should be "reported truthfully." Laugh. Younger sister Xue</p>
<p>Special Report of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Ms. Feng Wenfeng Discusses Heroines</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Deeply Admiring Qin Liangyu, Qiu Jin, and Soong Ching-ling, Women Who Can Sacrifice Themselves to Save the Country Can Surely Resolve National Crises</p>
<p>Recently, I attended two women's calligraphy and painting exhibitions, one jointly organized by Kang Tongbi and Yang Lingyu, and the other held by the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association. I was greatly amazed to see that they had achieved such wonderful success through their painstaking efforts. Originally, most Chinese women in the past did not leave their homes and spent their days doing needlework in their boudoirs, which was considered a remarkable achievement. It was heard that some who composed poetry and painted only did so for their own amusement and did not want others to know. However, in the past twenty years, women's schools have flourished, customs have changed, and the status of women in society is very different. Taking women's research in art as an example, the number has increased, and the quality has greatly improved, but they do not want to connect with each other, and the sectarianism is deep. Since the establishment of the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association three years ago, it has brought together more than a hundred female calligraphers and painters in the country, who work together sincerely, creating an unprecedented group, which is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>In this exhibition, there are works by more than seventy female calligraphers and painters, with a wide variety of styles and unique characteristics. For example, Ms. Feng Wenfeng's calligraphy is deep, simple, vigorous, ancient, and thick, without any delicate posture. Therefore, I wanted to visit this Ms. Feng. Coincidentally, I met Lu Danlin, who was willing to introduce me personally. So, the two of us headed to Deng Qi on Baiyun South Road. Ms. Feng greeted us sincerely. Seeing that she was very forthright. Danlin said: "Ms. Feng is from Heshan, Guangdong. Her father, Mr. Han, is a famous epigrapher in Guangdong Province. He has a rich collection of rubbings from past dynasties. When she was seven or eight years old, her father taught her to read, copy inscriptions, and paint. She has artistic talent and is tireless in her studies. After a few years of hard work, she has achieved considerable success in various styles of calligraphy, including seal script, clerical script, regular script, and cursive script. At the age of fourteen, Hong Kong held a charity sale of goods to raise disaster relief funds. She was invited to write on the spot and sold screens and fans for more than six hundred yuan, and was known as a child prodigy at the time. The next day, Mr. Sun Yat-sen held a military consolation meeting in the presidential palace. She sold a picture of a stable fire for four hundred yuan. In the past ten years, she has participated in many art exhibitions and won more than forty Chinese and foreign medals and certificates. She already has a good position in the female art world in South China. A woman can get such honor, of course, not by accident. She has a spirit of diligence, like one day, no matter what she does, can she not succeed?"</p>
<p>I asked her which heroines in ancient and modern history she admired the most? Ms. Feng thought for a while: "This is difficult to say, because there are too few outstanding women in the past few thousand years, and some are too focused on being virtuous wives and good mothers, and they have indeed made very little contribution to the country. At the moment, what I can recall are Qin Liangyu in the late Ming Dynasty, who was proficient in both civil and military affairs, resourceful, and resourceful. At that time, foreign enemies were invading, and she led troops to resist the invaders, repeatedly making war achievements. People like her are exactly the talents that China needs most now. I hope that our female circles will learn from her example, and everyone will have the courage to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and the national crisis will eventually be resolved. One is the martyr Qiu Jin. She has a deep understanding of Chinese literature, and her national concept is very deep. She can sacrifice one person, all family happiness, and sacrifice herself for the country, adding a glorious chapter to the history of the female circles, which is worthy of our emulation. As for Soong Ching-ling, I also have a very good impression of her. She has a spirit of perseverance, studiousness, and uncompromising. She has will, soul, and personality. Regardless of her political views, she has special talents as a person. Of course, there are also other unique talents, but we need to continue to work hard. Future generations will have a fair judgment."</p>
<p>She advocates that women study art, and her purpose is relatively close to it, and women must have a spirit of unity. The women in the city are too focused on pleasure and have no practical work. She herself practices calligraphy and painting every morning from 7:00 to 9:00, and has not stopped for twenty years. She also likes to compose poetry, photography, tennis, and swimming. These things are indeed beneficial and interesting in terms of individuals. Those who can do it are probably only in the upper-middle class. I very much hope that middle-class women, both in spirit and material, can give more assistance to the general working women. Everyone eats when there is food, and everyone enjoys when there is happiness. Wouldn't this be better?</p>

<p>Modern Medicine Journal</p>
<h3>Whooping Cough</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Pertussis</p>
<p>This disease is also called pertussis. Also known as convalescent cough. It is caused by the transmission of pertussis bacteria. Children under six are most susceptible to it. Mild cases cough three to thirty times a day. Severe cases cough up to a hundred times. Some present as simple bronchial mucosal inflammation. Some are combined with catarrhal pneumonia. Cough suppressants are used for treatment in the early stage. (1 yuan) Potassium bromide or bacterial solution must be used later. (2 yuan)</p>
<h3>Semen Sperma</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Semen is male reproductive fluid. It is thick and viscous when ejaculated. It is milky white. It has a special odor. It presents a alkaline reaction. It is the secretion of the gonads such as the testes. It contains a large number of sperm. Swimming in between. It is the source of offspring. The amount of ejaculation at one time is about three to four public sips. There are about 60,000 sperm in a public sip.</p>
<p>In addition to being the source of offspring, semen also relies on its nutrition for the medulla and brain. Therefore, those who suffer from seminal diseases such as nocturnal emission often complain of weak brains, forgetfulness, dizziness, and insomnia. The most effective medicine for symptomatic treatment is the gonadal endocrine preparation "Reproductive Element".</p>
<p>However, the source of nocturnal emission is more in the relaxation of the vas deferens. Therefore, "Himit's Semen Consolidating Tablets" are especially the main agent for severe aversion. This is what patients must know.</p>
<p>As for premature ejaculation, kidney failure, and weakness, in addition to "Reproductive Element" being an indispensable oral agent, if you want to seek a cure quickly, you should also receive painless electrotherapy.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Stomach Pain (Pathological Treatment)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>People often regard stomach pain as an incurable disease. Therefore, it is delayed and untreated. Those who have been lingering for many years are everywhere. It should be known that stomach pain is not difficult to treat. Only the source of stomach pain is different. Or it is due to excessive stomach acid. Or it is based on gastric inflammation and swelling. Or it is caused by gastric wall erosion. Or it is due to gastric muscle contraction and stinging. There are also those caused by stomach nerve pain and pyloric distension pain. If the medicine is limited to one corner, and it is not taken care of in all aspects, it is naturally impossible to treat. Even if the medicine can take care of the various sources of the above-mentioned diseases, fortunately, it is treated. However, the stomach of a long-term patient has had its root cause removed. If it is not nourished to strengthen it, it is still not a radical cure.</p>
<p>The patient Zhou Zhiyun has suffered from stomach pain for eighteen years. The pain goes away when the medicine comes, and the pain comes when the medicine goes. The suffering is unbearable. Last winter, he was introduced by his relative, Mr. Wei Zhicheng, to come to the consultation. I used "Stomach Pain Spirit" to take care of the various sources of the aforementioned diseases. And "Stomach Strengthening Element" is also the supreme good agent for nourishing the stomach. I told him to buy it from Taihe Pharmacy and take it according to the law. After taking four boxes in a row, the stomach pain was eradicated. In addition, the stomach turned stronger. After the cure, the medicine was stopped and he did not take it again.</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The world is evolving, and human affairs are becoming more and more troublesome. There are many irritations, and there are countless feelings. Therefore, neurasthenia has become a common disease in today's society.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia has the most changes. Although the severity is different, the source of the disease is in the lack or abnormality of the gonadal endocrine. The most effective treatment is to take "Reproductive Element" internally. We have used it to treat weak patients and have achieved the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>This spring, I used it to cure Mr. Cai Changchu's underdevelopment, Mr. Bao Chuan geng's premature aging, Mr. Zhu Yunhou's anemia and kidney deficiency, and (Female Reproductive Element) cured Mrs. Yang Xinmin's miscarriage abdominal pain. The period did not exceed one month.</p>
<h3>An Example of Treatment for Bone Pain and Limb Numbness</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Joint pain is not only due to internal rheumatism, but also due to syphilis and gonorrhea. If the medicine cannot take care of it, it will be impossible to cure it. Therefore, the best way to cure it is to take care of both removing rheumatism and searching for residual toxins. Otherwise, the disease will gradually increase. Limb numbness. Hemiplegia. Arteriosclerosis. Stroke. Sudden collapse. There are reasons to worry.</p>
<p>Last autumn, Mr. Li Zuoqing came to complain of joint pain and numbness in his hands and feet. After my examination, Mr. Li was actually caused by residual toxins. I told him to buy "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" from Zhongxi Pharmacy and take them. After taking five boxes in a row, not only did the poison go away, but also the joints were relaxed and the muscles were smooth. The hands and feet also immediately became flexible. He happily thanked me and left.</p>
<h3>Doctor Wang Shiying's Smoking Cessation Lecture</h3>
<p>The harm of tobacco has been spreading for ninety years. Weakening the country and sickening the people. There are many thanks for the gift. If you want to become strong, you must first remove the poison of tobacco. This is why the government strictly prohibits smoking. Top and bottom are in full swing.</p>
<p>The end of smoking is near. The deadline is imminent. If you don't quit at this time, the death penalty will come upon you. It will be too late to regret it.</p>
<p>Since the issue of smoking cessation has been urgently concerned by the whole country, it is also the duty of doctors to contribute their experience and insights. Therefore, I will give a few examples to help those who are determined to quit smoking to follow.</p>
<h3>(1) Smoking Cessation, Treatment of Diseases, and Strengthening the Body for Women</h3>
<p>Development of the breasts. Restore health and beauty. Remove poison and quit addiction. Regain youth.</p>
<p>(Patient) Mrs. Ni Zhaoxiong, 38 years old.</p>
<p>(Main complaint) Amenorrhea. Leukorrhea. Breast atrophy. Weak body. Heavy addiction. Withered face.</p>
<p>(Treatment) At the beginning of spring, I was accompanied by Mr. Ni to seek smoking cessation. I told her to buy and take the famous gynecological medicine "Female Reproductive Element" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to nourish and quit smoking, regulate menstruation and treat diseases, and use "Leukorrhea Spirit" externally to remove inflammation and cleanse the belt. The period was one month. Ke Gao safely quit the addiction.</p>
<h3>(2) Bone Pain and Stomach Pain Smoking Cessation Method</h3>
<p>(Patient) Mr. Wei Junxiang, 45 years old.</p>
<p>(Main complaint) Bone pain and limb numbness. Weak stomach and intermittent pain. Addicted for many years. Repeated quitting has failed.</p>
<p>(Treatment) This spring, I was introduced by his colleague Mr. Tang to come to the consultation. I told him to buy "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" from Zhongxi Pharmacy to treat his bone pain and limb numbness, and to take "Stomach Pain Spirit" to treat his pain cause. Take "Stomach Strengthening Element" to strengthen his weak stomach. After the symptoms were cured, "Reproductive Element" showed its safe smoking cessation effect. He was in good spirits and quickly recovered his health. The period was only about a month before and after.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Self-Treatment Experiences for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>(A letter from Mr. Fang Zhendong states) My wife, née Yang, comes from a distinguished family. After marrying me, she suffered from leukorrhea due to excessive childbirth. Because her appearance was a concern, she mistakenly delayed seeking medical attention, causing the condition to worsen. She had difficulty walking during the day and could not sleep peacefully at night. In the previous month, I had no choice but to write to you, requesting a recommendation for an effective self-treatment medication. I received instructions from your "Disease Q&amp;A" column and promptly purchased two boxes of "Leukorrhea Remedy" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Simalu (Fourth Avenue). Following the instructions, I inserted one tablet every other day. Initially, for the first three days, the purulent discharge increased. From the fourth day onwards, it gradually decreased. Before finishing the two boxes, this hateful leukorrhea was completely cured. The vagina was clean, almost like a virgin. My wife and I both feel deeply grateful and cannot express our thanks adequately. I am also sharing this information for those suffering from the same condition.</p>
<h3>Introducing Venereal Disease Experts: Dr. Yu Bofu, Dr. Zhan Nianceng</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhan Nianceng has profound knowledge and extensive experience. He has well-equipped electrotherapy devices. He is skilled in treating spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, syphilis, leukorrhea, kidney atrophy, phimosis, and various venereal diseases, with the confidence to bring back spring with his hands.</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A (Letters must include a detailed address and return postage)</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang from Korea</p>
<p>Hong Gao – You suffer from neurasthenia, forgetfulness, insomnia, premature ejaculation, cold limbs, and dizziness. The source of the illness lies in reproductive decline and endocrine deficiency. "Reproductive Element" is the most suitable medication. For spermatorrhea, take "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidating Pills." If you have a weak stomach, poor appetite, and are thin, you can take "Stomach Strengthening Pills" to improve your appetite and increase your weight.</p>
<p>My younger brother has masturbation, phimosis, and spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>Tang Zhiqin – Masturbation should be strictly forbidden. Spermatorrhea can be treated with "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidating Pills." Combining it with "Reproductive Element" to replenish deficiencies is even more effective. For phimosis, consult Dr. Zhan Nianceng for a painless surgery. As for your neighbor, Miss Zhang, I can help procure medication for bedwetting. Each dose costs one yuan.</p>
<p>Body odor and hair loss</p>
<p>Lu Xin – Yao Song previously provided detailed explanations of the pathology and treatment methods in this publication. I can dispense the medication for you, costing two silver dollars. There are two types of medicines used in combination.</p>
<p>Freckles and trachoma</p>
<p>Mr. Shi – Mr. Ping – Mr. Wu – The principles of freckles were described in detail in the previous issue. I can dispense the medication for one yuan per dose. For trachoma, it is best to consult an ophthalmologist for surgery. If you choose self-treatment with medication, it will be slower. I can dispense it for two yuan. Attention to those asking for medical advice! Remaining responses will be published next Wednesday in this publication!</p>
<h3>Actual Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) Second floor of China Trust Company at the corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Early Marriage, Sexual Overexertion, and Kidney Deficiency Saved</p>
<p>Patient: Jiang Jianzhang, 29 years old, from Zhejiang, businessman. (Chief complaint) – Kidney deficiency. (Medical history) – Mr. Jiang married too early and had a weak constitution. He usually ignored health maintenance and overexerted himself sexually, leading to kidney deficiency. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and the condition worsened daily. Both sexual function and vitality were lost, causing great mental suffering and leading to neurasthenia with numerous symptoms. Last winter, after seeing a colleague who suffered from spermatorrhea and kidney atrophy successfully treated by me, he asked to be introduced for treatment. (Treatment) – In addition to the latest scientific surgical and electrical treatments, I also prescribed targeted medication and instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Reproductive Element" from the Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking it, his vitality was rekindled. After about a month, his kidney disease was cured early, and the symptoms of neurasthenia gradually disappeared, achieving the most satisfactory result. He presented me with a plaque inscribed with "Miraculous Hands Bring Back Spring" and departed with joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>(2) Masturbation and Injury Leading to Frequent Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient: Lin Ruiqing, 19 years old, from Nanjing, trainee at a certain bank. (Chief complaint) – Spermatorrhea. (Medical history) – Three years ago, Mr. Lin was induced by bad friends to masturbate. Day after day, in the dark, he frequently indulged, causing significant damage to his vitality. He became thin and weak, with depleted blood and a weakened spirit. By the time he realized the harm and stopped, he had developed spermatorrhea, with the frequency increasing to more than ten times a month. Greatly alarmed, he sought treatment from me last winter. (Treatment) – In addition to recommending health maintenance methods, I also prescribed targeted medication and instructed him to purchase the famous preparations "Reproductive Element" and "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidating Pills" from Wing On Company. After taking less than two boxes, the frequency of spermatorrhea decreased sharply. He continued to take several boxes with peace of mind, and the spermatorrhea was completely cured. His body recovered to a healthy state, his muscles developed, his spirit was revitalized, and his weight increased. He was completely transformed.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Clinical Case Studies of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Vitality Rekindled, Pregnancy Achieved After a Long Marriage</p>
<p>Patient: Zhao Ziyun, 35 years old, from Wuxi, worker. (Chief Complaint) – Kidney atrophy, back pain, infertility after a long marriage, weakness. (Medical history) – Mr. Zhao is skilled in mechanical science, handsome, and capable. He has held important positions in factories and has always been highly regarded by the factory. However, in his early years, he enjoyed flirting with women, leading to significant damage to his reproductive glands. He suffered from severe kidney atrophy and nocturnal emission, with depleted vitality and declining sexual function. After more than ten years of marriage, there was no hope of having children, and he was in a state of extreme neurasthenia. He came to me for treatment last winter. (Present symptoms) – Fear of labor, irritability, kidney deficiency, back pain, night sweats, palpitations. (Treatment) – In addition to electrotherapy, I recognized that the root of Mr. Zhao's problem lay in the reproductive glands, and no other preparations could be effective. I instructed him to purchase and take "Reproductive Element" from the Sino-British Dispensary. After taking half a dozen boxes, all symptoms were miraculously cured. In early spring, he introduced his colleague, Mr. Jin, to me for treatment of the same venereal disease. I learned that his wife was several months pregnant.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea, Insomnia, Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient: Tong Chuqing, 25 years old, from Wuxian, works in a certain agency. (Chief Complaint) – Spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, brain weakness, depleted essence. (Medical history) – Mr. Tong was poisoned by erotic books in his early years and mistakenly developed the bad habit of masturbation, leading to relaxed sperm control, insomnia, body tremors, and the various symptoms he complained of. He repeatedly took tonics, but because they were not targeted, they were not fully effective. Last winter, the symptoms became more frequent, making him exhausted and unable to cope. He was introduced to me by his colleague for diagnosis. (Present symptoms) – Enlargement of the prostate gland, relaxation of the vas deferens, neurasthenia and weakness. (Treatment) I observed that the source of Mr. Tong's illness was such that it could not be cured without treating both the root and the symptoms. I prescribed "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductive Element." Mr. Tong purchased and took them as directed from the Five Continents Pharmacy. After taking them, his sperm control was strengthened, his brain was healthy, and his body was strong. He continued to take them for a month with peace of mind. Not only was the spermatorrhea cured, but he also slept peacefully at night. All his ailments were eliminated, restoring the youth he should have had.</p>

<h3>The Dangers and Treatment of Chronic Diseases</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongdao</p>
<p>Those with some basic medical knowledge all know that chronic gonorrhea is difficult to treat, but eight or nine out of ten people are unaware of the dangers of gonorrhea becoming chronic. Therefore, most patients, once gonorrhea becomes chronic, assume that the acute symptoms have passed and that they can be carefree from then on, often neglecting to seek treatment. This leads to the dangers of acute recurrence, acute complications, urethral stricture, and infection of their wives. The urethra harbors latent gonococci that can recur at any time, further damaging the urethra and causing trouble by invading nearby and distant organs, such as acute orchitis, acute arthritis, and painful symptoms of carditis. Therefore, the treatment of chronic gonorrhea should be more cautious.</p>
<p>Treatment of chronic gonorrhea – When gonorrhea becomes chronic, one should take internal medications that are antiseptic, diuretic, inhibit gonococcal growth, reduce secretions, and have analgesic and astringent effects. Regarding the new internal medicine for gonorrhea, "Mesailn," according to my clinical experience, it is indeed quite effective. On the one hand, electrotherapy should be administered. It is a globally recognized medical fact that gonococci are sensitive to heat. Gonococci cannot survive in an electric field of 42 degrees Celsius. Whenever I encounter chronic gonorrhea that has been treated for a long time without a cure, I always administer "Mesailn" internally and short-wave diathermy externally, which can cure the condition thoroughly and has been repeatedly proven effective. It is indeed the most suitable treatment for chronic gonorrhea. (End)</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatments for Freckles, Sunspots, Facial Scars, and Acne</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guixiang</p>
<p>Freckles, sunspots, facial scars, and acne are all skin conditions that affect the face. They generally occur during puberty due to increased secretion and accumulation of sebum, or due to neurovascular disorders. They often appear on the cheeks and bridge of the nose. Freckles and sunspots are often dark yellow-brown, shaped like pinheads or small beans. Even with thick layers of powder, they can still be faintly visible. The most hateful thing is that the more powder you apply, the more freckles appear. This is because the lead in the powder is toxic, causing the freckles to proliferate. Recently, although various beauty products have been advertised in newspapers as being able to treat freckles, most are either greasy cold creams or lead-containing powders. Applying them is not only ineffective but actually increases the problem. As a result, countless people have suffered. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the second of this month, the Ministry of Health found that women's facial powders often contain lead. After more than a year of meticulous chemical testing, it was found that more than 40% contain lead, which is very harmful. Even the globally popular French and Belgian face powders contain 25.95% lead. The Ministry has developed a new powder formula that has been tested and found satisfactory and is preparing to release it. Freckles, sunspots, facial scars, and acne are all types of skin conditions that cannot be effectively treated by applying powder or cold cream. One must use medications specifically designed to treat these conditions, supplemented with fragrance products free of oil or lead. Recently, a product called "Beautyl" has been sold on the market, which is specifically designed to treat conditions such as freckles and facial scars and has been found to be quite effective. This is because "Beautyl" is made entirely from medicines specifically designed to treat freckles and improve rough skin, combined with precious fragrance products using the latest scientific methods. It has an incredible and miraculous effect on conditions such as freckles, sunspots, acne, and facial scars. It is truly a good friend for young people suffering from freckles and facial scars.

<h3>The Importance of Treating Stomach Problems</h3>
<p>— Feng Gengcai</p>
<p>Our daily nutritional intake depends on a strong digestive system. If this is impaired, hundreds of diseases will arise. If there is no effective medicine to treat them, one will be plagued by illness forever without a healthy day. This can even lead to malnutrition, muscle wasting, mental fatigue, and consumption, becoming an incurable disease. According to statistics from the domestic medical community, this is caused by unclean food or imbalanced diets. Although there are many over-the-counter medications for this condition, they mostly contain anesthetic ingredients. After taking them, they only provide temporary relief and cannot thoroughly cure the patient, instead prolonging the illness into a chronic condition that is difficult to cure. Recently, "Wei Bao" (Stomach Treasure) was invented. This medicine contains no anesthetic drugs and has the function of regulating and benefiting the stomach's physiological functions, thoroughly curing various stomach problems with quite good efficacy. I have repeatedly confirmed its remarkable effects through clinical experience. I am writing this in the newspaper to introduce it to those suffering from stomach problems. (End)</p>
<h3>Nerve Development and Supplementation During Adolescence</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiming</p>
<p>Nerve development relies on the division of a special type of nerve cell. Through this division, the countless nerve fibers distributed throughout the body can elongate and develop. Everyone must know that the nerves in our body can be divided into two major categories: the central nervous system (Central Nervous System) and the peripheral nerves (Peripheral Nerues). The former can be further divided into the brain and spinal cord (Spinal Cord). They both exhibit quantitative and qualitative development and changes during adolescence. Among these, the development of the brain is particularly important to the lives of young people. It develops along with the development of other functions during adolescence. Generally, in the average person, the number of nerve cells in the middle layer of the brain increases greatly by the age of seventeen or eighteen, meaning that the nerve fibers gradually increase compared to before. This increase can continue until the age of thirty or so, but if there is malnutrition or improper behavior (such as masturbation and excessive indulgence) during adolescence, the secretory function of the internal sexual organs and reproductive glands will be hindered, affecting the entire body. As a result, the development of nerve fibers is also hindered, preventing the brains of countless geniuses from reaching their proper level of development. This can lead to neurasthenia (such as memory loss, dizziness, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and sexual dysfunction). Therefore, if the above symptoms occur during adolescence, one should immediately purify their heart and reduce desires, improve their daily environment, and take phosphorus hormone preparations internally, such as "Arolsen" tablets, to revitalize nerve cells and restore the internal secretion function of the reproductive glands. Then, the nerve fibers will increase again during adolescence. When the nerve fibers are developed, intelligence also develops simultaneously, and the thinking of young people will be purer, their work endurance will be enhanced, and their careers will flourish. Therefore, the nervous system is greatly related to one's entire life, and young people should pay attention to nerve development and supplementation during adolescence. (End)</p>
<h3>Perfect Treatment of Skin Diseases</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhicheng</p>
<p>Skin diseases are all caused by infection. There are so many types that it is difficult to describe them all, such as various types of ringworm, scabies, athlete's foot, and eczema. The cause is the presence of trichophyton. Our country is located in a temperate zone, and trichophyton proliferates particularly well, especially in the southern corner, where there are many patients. Because it is quite contagious and very difficult to cure completely, it comes and goes, causing great mental suffering. Because it can hinder the function of nerve cells, Germany realized the importance of completely curing skin diseases after the Great War. The great chemical therapeutic physician Mao Gengluo carefully researched and invented an effective method for skin diseases. Recently, he invented "Misulzine," a dressing specifically designed to treat skin diseases that can penetrate deep into the inner layer of the skin and kill trichophyton. In terms of electrotherapy, there are artificial sunlamps and Kuro Meier lamps, which are all perfect treatments for modern skin diseases. (End)</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Readers with questions about illnesses can submit their inquiries by letter. Please write clearly. If there are multiple questions, please list them as 1, 2, 3, 4 to separate them. The illness and its history should be explained in detail and concisely.

I will reply in a separate letter.</p>
<p>Pain Before and After Meals</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Zheng Ziyun of this city) I am sixteen years old and usually healthy. Suddenly, two years ago, I would occasionally experience pain in my chest. At first, I didn't pay attention to it. Recently, the pain after meals has become more severe than before, stopping after five minutes. If I eat a lot of food when the pain occurs, it can be slightly relieved. Also, my face is yellow and lacks color. Please provide guidance. (Answer) Your condition is likely a stomach problem caused by an imbalanced diet. You can try taking "Wei Bao" (Stomach Treasure) purchased from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, which may be effective. It is best to consult a doctor for a more appropriate diagnosis. Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, has excellent equipment and low consultation fees. You can seek treatment there.</p>
<p>Sudden Metrorrhagia</p>
<p>(Question from Ms. Le Yunqing of this city) I am 25 years old, have been married for several years, and have not yet conceived. Since last year, I have suddenly been suffering from metrorrhagia, which has not yet healed. I often feel dizzy and have a headache, and my memory is declining. I don't know if this will affect my ability to conceive. Please recommend a good doctor or medicine.</p>
<p>(Answer) Ms. Le Yunqing, the various ailments you are experiencing are caused by the metrorrhagia. You should treat it quickly, otherwise, it may become dry blood consumption, which will greatly hinder your ability to conceive. Dr. Feng Shanliang, a gynecology expert on the second floor of 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, has considerable experience in gynecological diseases. You can seek treatment there. Consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. The consultation fee is $1.20.</p>
<p>Will It Recur?</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Chen Juwen of this city) Three weeks ago, I suddenly developed small bumps on the glans penis with fluid. According to the doctor, it was a chancre, which has now been cured. However, there are still two small raised areas that are slightly painful to the touch. Will it recur? Please recommend a good doctor or medicine.</p>
<p>(Answer) Although the chancre has been superficially cured, it has not been completely eradicated and is likely to recur. You can go to Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, and undergo Kuro Meier lamp treatment and injections of Dermatol to completely cure it.</p>
<p>Is It Completely Cured?</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Zhang Chen of this city) I previously suffered from leukorrhea and was treated by a doctor. After about three months, it recurred due to excessive drinking. The leukorrhea dripped as before. I then washed it myself with medicated water. After more than a month, the leukorrhea stopped. It has been a month since then, with no abnormalities. Can this be considered cured? Is there still a risk of infection if I have relations with my wife at this time? Please advise!</p>
<p>(Answer) Although you have been partially cured by washing it yourself and there are no symptoms now, according to medical theory, it is not a thorough cure. It is best to consult a specialist doctor for a more appropriate examination. Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, has excellent equipment and has specialists for venereal diseases. You can seek treatment there.</p>
<p>Mistakenly Indulged in Masturbation</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Huang Biao from Hongkou in this city) I am now eighteen years old. When I was twelve years old, I was mistakenly induced by bad friends to develop the habit of masturbation. I have not been able to quit it to this day. In the last three or four years, whenever I move my armpits slightly, I sweat profusely. Although there is no odor, I always feel uncomfortable. Please recommend a good medicine or doctor.</p>
<p>(Answer) You should quickly quit masturbation, purify your heart, reduce your desires, and read more upright books. Avoid reading obscene novels again. On the one hand, purchase and take the endocrine-balancing nerve tonic "Arolsen" tablets from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to restore the function of your internal secretions, which may lead to a cure. It is best to consult a venereal disease specialist at a hospital for faster results. Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, is fully equipped with various local treatment machines. You can seek treatment there!</p>
<p>Whole Body Eczema</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Wang from this city) A month ago, I suddenly developed eczema all over my body, causing intense pain and itching. I have tried applying various ointments, but none have been effective. I am writing to your publication to request a recommendation for a good medicine or place to seek treatment!</p>
<p>(Answer) You are suffering from a virulent skin condition. You can purchase "Misulzine" from the Five Continents Pharmacy and apply it externally after bathing. At the same time, combine it with electrical treatment for faster results. Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, has an artificial sunlamp specifically for treating skin diseases, with great effectiveness.</p>
<p>Mental Confusion</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Cao from this city) Two years ago, I had a bad habit of masturbation. After getting married a few months ago, I have quit masturbation, but due to excessive sexual activity, I am now mentally confused, forgetful, dizzy, and unusually weak. Please recommend a good medicine for treatment!</p>
<p>(Answer) You are suffering from neurasthenia due to excessive indulgence. You can purchase the nerve tonic "Arolsen" from the Five Continents Pharmacy, which can gradually cure you. However, it is also important to purify your heart, reduce your desires, and strictly refrain from sexual activity.</p>
<p>Urethral Pain</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Wang from this city) A week ago, I occasionally visited Korea Village for pleasure. Unexpectedly, I have been experiencing urethral pain when urinating, with white pus flowing from the urethral opening. It seems to be leukorrhea. Is there a fastest way to treat it and see immediate results? Please provide detailed instructions.</p>
<p>(Answer) You are suffering from acute leukorrhea. With appropriate treatment, you can see immediate results. You can purchase the gonorrhea medicine "Mesalin" from Shi Company's Western medicine department. You must also have appropriate treatment. You can go to Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, and undergo short-wave diathermy.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Hold Off on Celebrating</h3>
<p>— Zibin</p>
<p>Teacher's Day on the sixth of June is coming again, and the teachers of this city are excitedly preparing various programs to celebrate it enthusiastically. Variety shows and dinners are being organized separately.</p>
<p>After sitting on the sidelines for a year, it's rare to have a "Teacher's Day" to celebrate enthusiastically, which is naturally quite appropriate. However, under the "difficult" current circumstances, should "Teacher's Day" simply be a matter of gathering for dinner, watching variety shows, or listening to famous speakers? It is quite disappointing to say so, but besides dinner and variety shows, something else should always be done, something like what should be done on a regular day. Although it is nominally "Teacher's Day," that day should also be celebrated enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Not many days ago, there was news of an elementary school teacher in a certain place committing suicide because of excessive back pay; and on the same day's newspaper that published the news of the Teacher's Day celebrations, there was local news from Songjiang about "Primary and Secondary School Teachers Demanding Salary." Reading these two pieces of news together is somewhat stimulating. This is still about the teachers themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, I think the teachers serving in the education field with their own bitter experience, will certainly not forget the textbook revision affair of the pseudo-state not long ago. Teachers should reflect deeply on this serious disaster of racial extinction during this "Teacher's Day."</p>
<p>Apart from the bankruptcy of the countryside and the illiteracy that has no opportunity to receive education, let's not talk about it, but just take the existing rural education, what a broken situation is it in? The teachers serving in the education field should be the most clear about this, and it is not difficult for us outsiders to imagine from reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a matter of the countryside and has nothing to do with our urban Shanghai. Then, let's look at Shanghai, where there are many shocking things.</p>
<p>There are many so-called "alleyway elementary schools" in Shanghai. I have a few friends who are engaged in this "pure and sacred" undertaking. Their treatment is almost unbelievable. They eat several hours of chalk dust every day, and their monthly salary is only a dozen or so dollars. Sometimes, these dozen or so dollars are often owed for two or three months.</p>
<p>How could this sacred undertaking be reduced to such a miserable situation? The reason is clear enough even without saying it; in such a situation, what kind of "education" will our so-called "national lifeline" in the next generation receive? Thinking about it makes people shudder, but the enemies will not let go of even these things. On the one hand, they use various means to invade, and in the so-called "autonomous regions" they have invaded, even such pitiful "education" has to have the textbooks changed to so-called "royal ways" and "loyalty to the emperor" as "slave education."</p>
<p>In such a serious situation, with the greedy enemies inching closer to us, it would be against the original intention of "Teacher's Day" for our teachers to just think about celebrating it enthusiastically on "Teacher's Day," right? Thinking of the old teacher in Daudet's "The Last Lesson," we are truly at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Hold off on celebrating! Now is not the time to celebrate!</p>
<h3>Yellow Flower Chapter</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>After an anxious wait of nearly a month, my uncle's reply finally arrived. I was almost as overjoyed as an elderly mother seeing her long-lost son returning home. Holding it, I was so excited that tears streamed down my face.</p>
<p>My uncle, the accountant at Shenghelong Tea Company, a short, plump man with athlete's foot, a small businessman who understood the value of money. From his appearance, he seemed a bit sly, but in reality, he was extremely timid. The first day he saw me, he started by grabbing me and saying, "Oh, you've grown up, you should be more sensible now. Don't go hopping around like a shrimp like you used to." He sized me up for a while, then continued, "Shaoquan, your cousin isn't turning out well either. Although he still listens to me, he only knows how to spend money, not how to earn it. Useless!... Hmm, and then there's your cousin, all day long, her mouth is full of freedom, freedom, what new era, what twentieth century, sigh, so annoying. One day I'll drive her to be a prostitute. Shame on the family, even the ancestral tablets are wide-eyed and uneasy..."</p>
<p>"Well, how about my matter?" I didn't want to hear anything except about my living arrangements.</p>
<p>"You—you, I've already secured you a position as an assistant in the tea warehouse."</p>
<p>"Not bad—"</p>
<p>"Fifteen dollars a month. I've been doing this for almost ten years, and I only make thirty-five dollars."</p>
<p>I was disappointed again, yet also seemed satisfied. Conflicting wills were constantly battling in my heart. People live in an atmosphere of contradiction...</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, spring grew old day by day. The seasons began to change.</p>
<p>Every year from the end of April to May, after the plum rain season, a rain shower in the morning, a rain shower in the evening, the rain stops, and the wind is gentle. The season warms up. However, that year was truly a bit unusual, one rain after another fell. But the weather still wore an old face, refusing to budge even slightly.</p>
<p>That evening, my uncle must have encountered some bad luck outside. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, he sighed and said,</p>
<p>"Alas, damn it, a disaster caused by heaven! Spring behaving like winter, it's all because of those modern women."</p>
<p>"No, don't you know, in previous years our north had vast areas that blocked the cold winds. Now they are gone. The cold winds from the north blow straight to us here," I said.</p>
<p>My cousin gave me a sweeping glance with melancholy eyes—she understood what I meant.</p>
<p>Besides my cousin, no one in the family could get along with me. But even she often spoke to me evasively, saying very far-fetched things. I knew what was on her mind. She had loved a man, and he supposedly loved her too. This, of course, was what my uncle opposed most in his life, constantly using unbearable and embarrassing words to ridicule or curse her. She seemed to be calm and composed. But in fact, she was extremely indignant. However, she was seduced by the bright future, surrounded by too many beautiful dreams, so she had to endure for the time being. Endurance is not necessarily a bad thing. Who dares to say that a volcano under heavy snow and ice will not erupt one day! But even this small, star-like hope was eroded. One night, my cousin came home very late. My uncle went to open the door. As soon as he saw the man, he said, beside himself with anger:</p>
<p>"If you're going to do it, do it all the way. I'll hand my daughter over to you. If anything happens to my daughter, I'll hold you solely responsible!"</p>
<p>After saying that, he even wanted to fight the man to the death.</p>
<p>The man ran away in a puff of smoke. After one meeting, he disappeared completely.</p>
<p>And my uncle, because of this matter, had a big fight with my aunt. What was rare was that my aunt seemed to have opened up. She said, "Our generation is over. The next generation should be allowed to live some of their own lives."</p>
<p>My uncle rolled his eyes in anger. He repeatedly exclaimed, "Rebellious, rebellious!" I clearly remember that he skipped a meal. Afterward, he chatted and laughed as if nothing had happened. But my cousin's misfortune became an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>She was lonely, she was desolate, and nothing could give her satisfying comfort.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of that incident that she was melancholy all day long...</p>
<p>When people are together, they often don't think about helping each other, but only about discovering each other's shortcomings. Therefore, everyone despises each other, attacks each other, and slanders each other. I was used to living in my uncle's house. Based on the fact that the two sides could never merge their thoughts, and based on the "human nature" mentioned above, verbal disputes, not malicious, often occurred.</p>
<p>In my memory, on one night in spring, the gentle air was a bit humid, and outside the window, fine rain was falling, falling. Every other day, the melancholy hidden in my heart gnawed at my fragile heart again—originally very bright raindrops, how did they suddenly become sewage!</p>
<p>Everyone was quiet. Only my uncle and I were left. He buried himself in reading a play "Traces of Flowers and the Moon". I, bored, was flipping through the newspaper of the day. He came over, moved closer to me, and said:</p>
