<p>（倫敦）英外相艾登今日在下院言及德國覆文、謂過去數日之事件、分為二類、一與德政府陳述歐洲和平新方案之來文有關、一與英法比三國政府間涉及三月十九日白皮書之往來文件有關、四月一日德特使里賓特羅浦至外部遞德國覆文、昨日渠吿里氏、英政府對於德國最近提議、僅有初步研究之時間、將繼續硏究之、因認其甚關重要、應予以愼重之檢討也、渠又吿以英國之目的、在使談判進行、俾促成最後解决、英國將竭其全力以期達此目的、請以此意轉達希特勒、惟德國對於一種中間時期一點、迄未能採納英政府意思云、</p>
<p>英外相繼向下院聲明、英法比三國參謀部之未來談話、决不增重英國之政治上義務、此項談話僅涉及談判未進行時之中間時期、且純為技術性質、英政府已向法比二國政府說明昨日送交法比二國之函、重行聲明英國將維護羅卡諾公約之義務者、並不含有英國認調和業巳失敗之意、參謀部之談話將在倫敦開始、日期尙未决定、但俟必要布置辦妥後卽將舉行、英國决定舉行參謀部談話之主要目的、不過欲對於信任之恢復有所補助耳、英政府認此談話不致碍及解决云、英外相答勞合喬治之問話、謂軍事方案决不見諸實施、除非法比遭遇無端攻擊耳云、答外相又保守黨愛斯特之問話、謂英屬海外自治領雖非羅卡諾公約簽字國、但英政府將以談判之種種經過情形詳吿之、至於意國曾吾以羅卡諾公約擔保國之資格函致法比、聲明願維護羅卡諾公約義務與昨日英國所發出者同、則渠未有所聞云、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>（麥唐納問）各關係國參謀部所當舉行之談話、意大利是吾參加、</p>
<p>（首相答）英國政府現所贊成參加之參謀部談話、係與法比兩國參謀部共同舉行者、至意國政府是吾擬與法比兩國舉行同樣談話、英國政府尙未接獲任何情報、</p>
<p>（麥唐納問）此項參謀部談話、是吾可以展緩舉行、以待對德談判獲有進步之後、再行開始、</p>
<p>（首相答）英法比三國參謀部、所當舉行之談話、係對目前時局加以討論、此層業由艾登外相提出解釋、夫對德談判欲其成功、必須恢復各關係國間之信任心、始克有濟、此項參謀部談話、卽為恢復信任心之要素、故展緩舉行之說、政府未便予以贊成、</p>
<p>（麥唐納問）請政府對下議院提出保證、此項參謀部談話、務須由內閣嚴加監督、其目的務以防禦性質為限、不可如反對派自由黨領袖路易喬治所主張、為對德作戰而發、</p>
<p>（首相答）本人今特提出保證、政府對於此項談話、自當以有效之方式、嚴密加以監督、至路易喬治之主張、則純屬幻想耳云云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>德代表作補充說明　針對蘇聯顯而易見</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國代表里賓特洛浦、曾於午後訪問外部决官在西泰爵士、舉行長時間談話、當就英國政府對於德國備忘錄中若干點所要求補充說明者、提出解釋事後、里賓特洛浦卽在長途電話中、與希特勒元首交談、歷時頗久、據德國大使館人士聲稱、里賓特洛浦當在倫敦勾留若干日、尙未决定云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於德國與毘隣各國訂立互助公約問題、頃據德國代表團左右人士切實說明、謂德國僅願與西隣各國簽訂此項公約、而不願與東方奧國·捷克·波蘭·與蘇聯諸國締結之、蓋各該國「政策旣不安定、而又互相敵視、形成對峙、德國若果與之訂立互助公約、或將不得不在各該國間、擔任仲裁者之地位、此非德國所願、」故就德國之意、不如簽訂一般天空公約、而將上述各國包括在內、較為愈也云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）德國備忘錄全文、於本日午後始在此間發表政界人士加以評論、謂希特勒元首旨在取得英國輿論之同情心、此其手腕殊為靈敏、又謂觀於備忘錄所提和平計畫、德國所注重者為西歐方面、而在東歐方面則並無保證安全之願望、其視錢所指針對蘇聯、允為顯而易見云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國負責方面對於希特勒答覆四國建議之備忘錄、認為完全消極、謂德國對案將使集體安全互助制度及國聯本身皆歸失敗、羅卡諾公約簽字國皆認定在開始談判整理歐洲和平以前、德國所破壤之國際法律、必須至少恢復一部、但德國今對其所擬計畫、幾已全部拒絕之矣、德國備忘錄漢視海牙國際法庭、而主張新的公斷法庭、至於詳則並未申叙、此舉直為對於國聯之重大打擊、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間各界人士對德復文之反響、可以下述三點概括之、　德復文中所提議締結之「安全公約」、是否能與現行各互助公約毫無牴觸、　德復文中所提出關於限制空軍行為各點、似未曾包含於其所提議之天空公約以內、　德復文中堅持須各國對其違犯條約之行動不加顧問時、方能重入國聯、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）外交部長佛蘭亭頃於晚間七時、晋謁薩勞總理、當就德國備忘錄所造成之局勢舉行會商、歷一小時始畢、關於此層、負責人士頃宣稱、德國對於東西兩方邊界、顯以為攻守之勢旣殊、故其所採方略自不能從同、該國一俟在萊茵河防禦工事建造完成之後、卽可不虞英法兩國之干涉、而無西顧之憂、然後向東歐中歐發展、此層不可不防、至於法國則現仍主張和平、係一整個的、幷信守集體安全制度一項原則、今後國際局勢不論如何發展、法國行動自當以此項態度為依據也（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）阿比西尼亞政府頃向國聯會秘書長愛文諾送致牒文、要求國聯會對於意國加緊制裁、及在財政上援助阿國、並謂意國雖已接受國聯會行政院十三國委員會之申請、而在原則上允卽開始議和、但進行戰事依然如故、至其所操作戰手段允為殘暴、務望國聯會迅速向意國政府有所行動、俾其尊重戰時法例、結論謂「國聯會各會員國之重要職責、在使公理戰勝强權、阿國政府茲特申說此點、諒不致目為奢求也」云云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據羅馬方面消息、意國政府業已接受國聯會十三國委員會主席之邀請、與該委員會接洽意阿議和問題、此間阿比西尼亞公使館對於此訊、表示懷疑、謂「此項消息、尙未正式證實、就吾人視之、意國卽使接受邀請、其目的亦無非為避免媒油禁運辦法之實施而已、此際該國若在談判期內停止軍事行動、則吾人始信其具有和平誠意也」云云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）此間負責方面今日宣稱、査內湖區雖為英國之勢力範圍、但英國對於意軍進佔該湖附近地點、無須憂慮、蓋首相墨索里尼必能言行一致、尊重英國在該地之利益也、此間否認意軍佔據該地含有政治作用、及此决進攻動機在於乘此英國專注萊茵問題無暇他顧之時、以武力解决意阿之爭執、官方宣稱、吾人動機純屬軍事性質云、今日戰報謂、除貢達外、意軍並已攻克馬薩登基及拉斐二鎭、阿皇禁衛軍已有多人投降意軍、阿皇現在向台西急退中、意軍空軍現正自東西兩方齊向臺西夾攻、空軍及砲兵在阿千奇湖以北亦甚活躍云、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>— 兪飛鵬</p>
<p>在世界當中，有了人類，就有了兒童，現在的成人，就是從前兒童，現在的兒童就是將來的成人，也就是擔負國家社會事業的人們。所以一個民挨盛衰的成因，直可說是完全建築在兒童的身上，古代有一句話，十年樹木，百年樹人，樹木能有十年培植，才可希望牠的枝葉茂盛，而人非百年不可，樹人須要百年的功夫，這不是完全靠着一代一代的兒童嗎？</p>
<p>如今二十世紀的時代，人類正各自拼着性命求他的民挨生存，因為弱肉强食，巳成為天演的公例，沒有强盛的民族，就沒他的噍類，世界上有許多民族，血戰多年求他的解放，或是開闢他的疆土，無非是為他子孫着想，和為他的民族種子求生機。</p>
<p>民族在一個衰弱不堪的時候，唯一的希望，是在提心吊膽的把他興盛起來，或是恢復起來。恢復的方法很多，從前越王勾踐，幾乎被吳王夫差，滅亡了，幸而越王想出種種方法來，洗滌他的恥辱，第一個方法，就是十年「生聚」，十年「敎訓」，「生聚」就是從「量」的方面努力，「敎訓」就是從「質」的方面用功夫。</p>
<p>現在依據一般調査，全國的兒童約有一萬萬人，比之各國，數目實在可觀，就「量」的觀察，也就觳雄視一方，但在「質」的方面看起來，比諸歐美國家，不能不退避三舍了！</p>
<p>講究兒童培植的方法，各國都有許多計畫和方案，蘇聯會頒布有一個小朋友的小五年計畫，世界各國也曾分別規定日期作為兒童節，大家在慶祝和熱鬧，我們中國自然也同感需耍，而且需要的程度似乎更加嚴重迫切。</p>
<p>在兒童年的工作，可分為三方面：一是兒童的健康，目的在「量」的充實；二是兒童的敎育，目的在「質」的充實；又一是兒童的保障和救濟，目的在「質量」並顧，特別注意於救護遭遇不幸的兒童。在兒童年實施的辦法當中，又曾規定，就是說「組織兒童儉約儲蓄會」。現在我們要把這項用意簡單的說明一下。</p>
<p>我們人類生存的工具，總理的遺敎上，曾經說過衣食住行四大要素，在上古的時候人類生活簡單，對於這四項要素，並顯不出若何重要，但是時代嬗遞，直到文明進化的今日，巳非此四項不可了，至於維持這四項要素的必需條件，又是甚麼呢？可以不言而喻的就是經濟學上所講的三種要素：一是土地。二是勞力。三是資本。簡單的說金錢就是資本的交換代表物。</p>
<p>在一個沒有生產能力的小學生或是中學生裏頭，對於金錢的關係比蛟的沒有多大，因為他們的生活，大半是寄託在一個父或兄的身上，所以到手的金錢，也不知道牠的來處，或是拼着勤苦，或是流着血汗，他們一到手便要花去，雖不能說揮金如土，但至少也不知道從事儉約，以謀將來的幸福。</p>
<p>現在我們交通部，為着全國一萬萬以上兒童將來的幸福着想，特就郵政儲金局裹，籌辦一種「兒童儲金」。基金十分穩固，利息特別優厚，手續力求簡便，務使各個兒童，都得享受這種利益，最小的兒童，並且可以請託學校老師代辦，幾分錢或幾角錢也可以隨時儲蓄，譬如你能每天節省糖果餅餌的三個銅子，一月也可儲存三角錢，一年也可以儲存三元多錢，再加上你的父母或親戚給你的賀儀，和郵局給你的利息，等到幾年畢業之後，不就是有一筆很大的欵項嗎？</p>
<p>一般人在社會上常有句口號，就是說：「金錢萬能」，你如果要實現你的希望，或是成就你的事業，沒有金錢，是不能發生効力的，小朋友們唯一的希望，就是想有讀書的機會，由小學而中學而大學，若在有力升學的家庭，固然不感覺甚麼困難，但是在我們國家中產以下的社會裏，失學的兒童和無力升學的兒童，恐怕要比較多出幾倍呢！（據調査所得全國兒童約在一寓萬人，在學校裏的只有一千二百萬人）假使每個兒童都能彀懂得儲蓄的道理，從初級小學起，就能由父母或親長給他一個有儲蓄必要的暗示，或者時時鼓勵他儲蓄的興趣，不是他的入學升學或成人的事業，都可以解决嗎？</p>
<p>社會上一般犯罪的事實為着金錢而構成，這是一個極普遍的現象。但是仔細考察一個人貧乏的原因，一半是不能耐勞苦，一半是不肯節約，另一方面，也因為的慾望過高。為滿意他的慾望，於是就生出浪費靡弛種種惡習，兒童們如果能養成節約的美德，平時知道儲蓄的道理，一旦需用金錢的時候，就可以應付裕如，便不致感到甚麽貧乏的飢荒了！這就是交通部郵局籌設兒童儲金的一個動機。</p>
<p>今年是兒童年，我們交通部沒有別的慶祝你們，祇希望全國小朋友和小朋友的父母兄姊，以及學校老師們，從今天兒童節起督促你們儲蓄習慣的養成，實現你們偉大的計畫，我們歡呼：</p>
<p>兒童儲金制度萬歲！</p>
<p>兒童年萬歲！</p>
<p>中華民國萬歲！</p>

<p>寄皮箱不知手槍　問　他把箱子放在什麽地方、答放在桌上、我也沒有注意、問從來怎樣、答我把牠收到房裏、放在牀底下、皮包並不重、因為鎖着、我不知道裏面是什麼、問你什麼時候才知道裏面是手槍、答就在那一個星期中、賀坡光來開了箱子、我也看見手槍、當時我面部表示不快、問他為什麽放在此地、他不開口、第二天郭智峯就來拿去了、問就是這枝手槍嗎、答好像還要長一點、問私藏手槍、就是不行刺也要犯罪、你何以讓他們放了一個星期呢、答本案是非常事件、我雖看見手槍、並不知道他們要刺汪院長、他們為什麼要放在我家裏、我不知道、我也不能深責他們、問他们行刺已經三次、每次都是用招租帖表示已否動手、如果沒有動手、就把招租帖貼在一定的地方、然後把一個人打電報通知他们、第二次電報是你去打的，是不是、答根本無此事、問這是張玉華供的呀、答無此事、審判長乃宜讀張之供詞、盧仍狡賴、</p>
<p>否認曾發電通知　問你在偵查庭說過、可以到電報局去查看電報、是不是你簽的名、如果調到得、當然是與你有利的、但是你在那一個電報局發的電、是那一天發的、發給誰的，你得告訴本院、才好去查呀、答我根本不知道、怎樣告訴你、審判長乃將各點訊問張玉華、張犯槪以謂不清楚搪塞、問你用過晨光社多少錢、答我沒有用過、問張玉華不是送過你五十塊錢的嗎、答無此事、問你自己供過說、他們送我五十塊錢、我不要、他們一定要送、怎麼可賴呢、答沒有這回事、審判長乃將盧犯在偵查庭中筆錄提示、盧犯始答稱、這五十塊錢是十二月二十七日張玉華到鎮江、約我遊金焦二山、我因脚上有濕氣、不能走、他送錢給我、我在鎮江家裏收的、問他叫你拿這錢逃走、是不是、答不是、問叫你走、也许是好意啊、答但當時不是這樣的、問你在憲兵司令部供過說、「他們與陳鉻樞李濟珠有關係、經費是由華克之向王亞樵轉向陳李拿來的、他們要打中央要人、我以為不會成事實、所以沒有告發」、是不是、答這個筆錄靠不住、問你在首都地方法院及本院偵查庭都供過、你記得嗎、答我祇說平時聽見他們說、有一個姓孫的、一個姓沈的、要對軍事領袖不利、並不知計劃如何、孫鳳鳴也沒有見過、問然則你祇是收藏手槍而已、答我當時並不知情、並且玻唸佛二十年戒殺救生的、</p>
<p>查證據改期再審　至此、審判長乃謂、本案今日不能終結、各辯護律師如對調閱卷宗方面、有何意見，可以陳述、各律師乃分別陳述意見、審判長旋命書記官宣讀李項盧三犯供詞、均經簽名、審判長遂正式諭知本案因尙須調查證據、調閱卷訊、本日不能宣告辯論終結、改期再開庭繼續審宗、俟定期後、再行送達傳票、各被告仍還押、宜布退庭、時為五時五十分、（完）</p>

<p>新聲社記者、特訪晤丘君於寓决、據述、南洋荷屬各埠華僑、自去歲經政府當局及僑商胡文虎宣傳、對祖國情形、均已明瞭、國產商品輸入、亦漸增多、從前華僑經營日貨者、均改營國產品、故國貨銷路、漸見發達、國產罐頭食品、及水泥雨傘麵粉鋼鐵器皿等類、需要頗鉅、自荷幣减値、每一荷盾値國幣二元、尤為國貨輸入之好機會、故希望國內工業界、從速努力向南洋推銷、俾獲得海外巿塲、</p>
<p>日貨現正急謀發展</p>
<p>日本商品、過去在南洋推銷、因賴華僑商肆之經售、並不自設商塲、祇有專營批發之行號、自華僑改營國貨後、日人鑒於市塲被奪之危殆、遂相繼自設商店、規模不大、尙難與華僑商店競爭、僑胞初相約不購用日貨、惟日貨賴本國輪運、及銀行界經濟上之調劑、貨運迅速、成本極輕、則為我華僑所不及、</p>
<p>亟盼實現三種事業</p>
<p>故現在南洋華僑、希望祖國政府、及銀行工商界、從速實現三種事業、　開辦南洋航綫、使國貨運往南洋、直接運輸、擺脫外商輪運之束縛、　設立大規模銀行、調劑華僑金融、　創設國貨推銷機關、俾僑商不須跋涉長途、歸國採辦商品、</p>
<p>蘇島華僑生活狀况</p>
<p>蘇島、為荷屬爪哇所管轄、地處重要、商業繁盛、每年土產胡椒戈丕椰乾等貨物、輸出數額甚鉅、全島華僑計有三十一萬餘人、十分之四經營商業、餘均作工、生活尙稱安定、惟在社會因格於國勢、雖有如許僑胞、終不若他國少數僑民之强大、故設遇事件發生、當地政府不免稍有偏袒、至荷政府現對華僑入境稅、每人仍徵一百五十盾、合國幣三百元、貨物進口稅、則一律徵收百分之三十云、</p>

<p>估計價値須五六萬元昨調解未成　金在法庭瀝陳乃妻最近行為不端　又傳金陸糾紛已經某人調停解决</p>
<p>前本市土地局長金里仁（皖籍、）於遜淸光緖三十二年、娶名妓蘇州女子朱雪卿（原名陸燦娟）為繼室、迄今巳三十餘年、自經任土地局長後、即在曰克路大光明影戲院後三〇二號自建五層樓洋房一宅為同居之所、最近金陸燦娟以乃夫又與粵女麥佩貞結合、並在西子湖畔建富麗堂皇之洋房、作</p>
<p>藏嬌處所　復與某名舞女同居於市中心區民壯路三七號、而對本人生活費用、則五月不付、於是延凌啟鴻律師、向第一特區法院訴請調解離婚、並給付膽養費六萬元、而金亦延江一平·吳寳泰·律師提出管轄問題、致調解未成、陸氏遂另向上海地方法院調解處訴請別居、並要求給付贍養費三萬元、而金則指陸氏曾</p>
<p>與彈詞家　馮子美（別號河東生）同赴杭州、致調解又未有結果、惟金則以本人所有通商銀行股票古董字畫等、悉為陸氏取去、估計價値五六萬元、遂亦向特一法院調解處聲請傳陸氏到案調解、將財物返還、此案於昨日下午、由特一法院推事孟庭柯開十二法庭傳審、陸</p>
<p>燦娟未到　由凌啟鴻律師代理、金則與吳寳泰律師到庭、據金陳述為與被聲請人非正式夫婦、祗同居關係耳、至其所取去之物、為通商銀行股票二百十五張、上海電話公司股票五股、古拉克倫磅公司股票五十股、以及漢冶萍股票·中國·中孚·銀行存單、皮衣兩箱、漢玉古玩銀器等値價　萬餘元、並稱此次</p>
<p>情變原因　實緣於民國二十二年、被聲請人在書塲結識一表弟周漱庵、即與唐鳳春合唱果報錄之彈詞家馮子美、時我住於白克路六號、嗣馮一度失踪、人均言為金太太所匿、我聞之、即與彼謂人言我將作烏龜、爾須自重、但據我現所知、當時馮即住於</p>
<p>我家隔壁　之四號內、食物均由彼送去、有四川人李某可證、且二十三年時、我跌傷手臂住於醫院、馮時在我家、有某寺住持覺非可以證明、因是日覺非亦在、後由彼以汽車先送馮至新新旅館、後送覺非至振華旅館、總之我與陸燦娟同居三十年、</p>
<p>今竟反目　至如此地步、其原因實基於此、我因此事致名譽大受影響云云、凌律師辯稱、聲請人之聲請全非事實、因陸燦娟現尙住於金四處公館之一、即白克路三〇二號也、至股票則為聲請人記名者、何所謂返還、故</p>

<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>國定四月四日為兒童節，實倡自中華慈幼協會。茲又屆第五次舉行之期矣。恰適値兒童年擴大運動之期全國各省巿有盛大的慶祝，以喚醒多數民衆提倡兒童事業，復興民族，國運昌大，此其始基。</p>
<p>今日之兒童，即將來國家之主人，孔子曰：後生可畏，西哲有言：『國家文明的進步，隨着兒童的脚跟』。凡此種種，皆可以闡明兒童為民族之生命，文明之生機，國家之元氣，社會之質點，不容忽視。然則由是言之，吾人對於今日之兒童節，實有無上的希望。兒實節之慶祝，更有重大之意義。</p>
<p>先養成健全之分子，方有健全之社會，有健全之社會，然後有健全之國家，是以近年來吾以此義，策進本會，明吿邦人。無如慈幼之事業，正在進行，而外侮之來，又相接踵，本未固而先受摧殘，力未充而復遭打擊，瞻念前途，實深悚懼！欲謀救國宜從根本上着手，須先培養國家生命所寄托之兒童，以十年生聚，十年敎訓之義，以敎養國內多數之兒童，國難可解，外侮永絕，使我五千年之中華民族，常能屹然獨立於世界。</p>
<p>觀一國之盛衰，莫不視乎其兒童敎養之良吾而定，則吾人當此兒童年中之兒童節，其意義之重大，當　異乎尋常，又無可待言。趁此時期，更揭其意義如次：須知兒童為國家之兒童，非父母所私有，故其敎之養之，國家應負其責，試觀歐美各國，對於兒童保育，設有種種機關，以盡其敎養兒童之職責，可以知矣，此一義也；兒童敎養必須有平等之機遇，無論其貧富，以及有父兄與吾，應使其各得其所，無衣食之堪虞，又應使之各有所學，謀天能之發展，端其始以謀其終，俾成為健全分子，以安社會，而强國家，比又一義也。所冀海內賢達，宣傳此義，勸導社會，督促政府，以謀慈幼事業之發展，而建百年樹人之大計！倘能自茲以往，國難可解，敵國外患，永不復見，吾國人今日所舉行紀念之兒童節，庶為不虛矣！</p>
<h3 id="c153">敎養兒童與民族前途 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>兒童是綿延中華民族生命的種子，中華民族前途的存亡興衰，全在今日之兒童；今日兒童前程之有無希望，其資任則在今日之父母，今日之社會，與今日之政府。所以今日之父母，今日之社會，與今日之政府，應切實負起愛護兒童，敎養兒童的責任。愛護兒童，敎養兒童，非為一家一族之事；其有關於國家為民族的前途者實甚大。古語云「幼吾幼，以及人之幼」。所以我們愛護兒童，並不是私兒童。國民政府所以定今年為兒童年，就是要全國人民知道兒童與國家民族，關係的重要。現在我國一般人民對民族的觀念，還似乎太淺；而對於家族的觀念，則似乎太深。我們如果能够以為家族打算的觀念，轉移到為民族來打算，我敢相信中華民國中華民族决不會有今日這種不幸的遭遇，就算是有了今日這種空前危難的遭遇，我們也可以有力量來渡過這個危險，打破這個困難。不幸全國人民到今日，却還都祇為自己的一家一姓一族來打算，不能為整個國家民族來打算。所以中國雖然有四萬萬五千萬人，的佔全世界人口四分之一，差不都有全歐洲各國人口之衆，却還不免被少數民族來壓迫，來欺侮，來支配！</p>
<p>這個原因在什麽地方呢？分開來說；第一，就是我們四萬萬五千萬的人民等於一般散沙，沒有團結，大家祗為個人打算，為一家一姓一族打算，不為國家民族來打算，道赴第一個原因。第二，就是我們大都對於『不孝有三，無後為大』，的道理，懂得不透澈，祗知單純的傳種，而不知培植這個種子。須知人多而不受敎育，是沒有用處的，沒有力量的。世界上往往有不受敎育的多數民挨，為受敎育的少數民族所壓迫欺侮與支配。所以祗求量的增多，不求質的改良，是沒有用的，韓非子曾說：「愚民百萬，謂之無民」，我們到草棚裹去看看我們貧苦同胞，在街路上看看我們的苦力同胞，他們不受敎育，他們沒有智識，他們沒有民族意識，國家民族的存亡興褒，好像與他們沒有關係。我們再到貧民窟裏去看看我們貧苦兒童的情形怎樣？我們貧民窟的十個兒童，就幾乎有十個兒童有病，不是有眼病，就是有其他的病，他們平日專在汚水裏垃圾堆煤屑堆上過生活，體格不健，智識也沒有。如此兒童將來長大成人後，怎樣會有能力，怎樣能够為國家民族來吐氣揚眉！常人僅僅知道『不孝有三無後為大』的表面意義，殊不知我們有了後，不去好好敎養；任其放浪不肖，甚或罄家蕩產，却更為不孝。墨索里尼說：『國家的命運，繫於人口的增加』不是父親的人可以說不是人！這句話，雖不失為一種與國熱情的流露。但是若在我們人口本甚衆多的中國，如果僅事量的加增，而不圖質的改進，那還不能算是眞正忠於國家。所以我們今日最大的任務，不僅在傳種，而是在培養優良的種子。大家要為國家民族的前途着想，來愛護兒童，敎養兒童，使今日之兒童，不要變成了亡國之種。</p>
<p>復興德國的哲學家斐希德（Fichte）和我有同樣的意見。當時德國受了拿破崙的壓迫，毫無辦法；他因此大聲疾呼，勸全國國民以「培養優良的國民種子自任」，後來不到廿幾年就把德國從根救起來了！這一點，我們不能不趁今天的機會，希望全國之為人父者，特別注意，從今以後，大家要切切實實的負起愛護兒童，敎養兒童的責任，以圖我們中華民族的復興！在國定兒童年這一年期內，我們不但要努力提倡推行兒童事業；同時還要喚起全國人民的注意，使他們對於兒童有一個新的觀念；我們更要喚起全國的兒童認識自己地位的重要，今日為兒童，將來即是中華民族的主人翁，也即是繼續中華民族生命的份子。</p>
<p>上海市政府關於兒童事業，在可能範圍之內，一定去努力推行，决不敢入棄責任；尤其是關於貧苦兒童事業，當特別注意。如去年計劃實施的貧民住宅，即其一例。每一貧民村，有二三百間或三四百間房屋；在每一個貧民村內，我們最注意的，也就是關於兒童的福利。我們的計劃：要在每一個貧民村內，設個簡易的診療所，一個小學校，一個兒童的樂園，使貧苦兒童有病可去醫治，有學校可去讀書，又有小小的園地供他們玩耍，使他們可不再到汚水裏煤屑堆上去過生活。此外還有一個小小的兒童寄托所。其餘在南市有貧民兒童寄兒所，在各區有衛生事務所；關於兒童的衛生與檢騐，如小學生體格檢騐，我們都十分注意。但是兒童事業，是一個偉大而重要的事業，决不是政府的能力所能做得到，必須整個社會與政府一致來努力推行，始克有濟，所以今天我們同時還要喚起上海市民一致來贊助兒童事業的推行。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c154">本年中葡盃停賽　約定葡萄牙二十五日對中國隊比賽 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>據沈嗣良談、中葡杯足球賽、本屆自恊進會捐贈銀盃後、原擬在四月中旬　續舉行，現已决定作罷、其原因為西聯足球程序尙有三分之一未賽、葡隊不能抽暇應約、更以世運足球在港預選完畢後、代表隊即須來滬、邀本埠勁旅作三塲練習賽、時間勢有衝突、故已與葡體育會商洽將此舉暫行作罷、並擬約葡萄牙隊與我國世運代表隊作友誼比賽一塲、以資切磋、日期則决定於本月二十五日舉行，至世運代表隊在滬舉行之三塲練習賽、與賽隊除葡萄牙已可决定外，其他兩場現尙在接洽中云、</p>
<h3 id="c155">我國出席台維斯杯代表　在港表演後原輸出發　許承基林寳華雙打竟遭意外損失　單打許勝徐煒培蔡惠全不敵林珍 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>香港通訊、台維斯杯網球比賽、即將舉行、我國已决定選派許承基鄭兆佳為代表、前往出席、嗣以林寳華藝術亦臻上乘、且擅雙打、遂准其目費隨隊出國、並決以許為隊長、林為管理員、而甫自英國歸來之蔡惠全、球術計屬優良、亦願自費參加、經巳邀准、許林兩氏、以賽期在邇、已由滬乘意鄄船利亞號首途、二十八日晨七時三十分抵港、旋於十一時三十分應本港木球會之約、赴該會球場作表演比賽、下午五時、偕蔡惠全原輪離港，途次各地、如時間許可、均擬登岸與各地名手作友誼比賽、藉資練習、鄭兆佳現仍留美、將逕赴歐出席、茲將在港比賽情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>雙打許林竟敗陣</p>
<p>十一時三十分、許承基林寶華等、聯袂至木球會球場、先與蔡惠全徐煒培作雙方表演比賽、許林一組、先以三比一局佔先、迭被蔡徐一組、追回平手、許林再勝一局、及被蔡徐追及、且直勝兩局、以六比四殺敗許林、因時間關係，雙打僅作一盤比賽、查許林之敗、非因球術不如蔡徐、惟因輕率從事、致受意外損失耳、</p>
<p>許承基勝徐煒培</p>
<p>雙打比賽後、繼由許承基對徐煒培作單打比賽、共賽二盤、許以六比零、六比一獲勝、是場許之表演頗佳、發球尤使徐氏幾無法應付、勝來殊不費力、不失名將風度、</p>
<p>大林珍勝蔡惠全繼之者為SA林珍對蔡惠全、蔡之球術、本頗不差、惟發球之技、異常平凡、且氣力不及林珍、故第一盤先勝一局後、迭被林珍取回五局、急起直追、至三比五、最後一局、又為林珍所獲、遂以六比三先負、第二盤林珍以二比零佔先、其後蔡雖搶回二局、仍不免六比二再敗、</p>

<p>今天是兒童節，是小朋友們歡欣歌舞的大節日；這一天可說是完全屬於小朋友的。我們於竭誠慶祝之餘，就應該給小朋友們謀幸福，所以特地出一個「兒童幸福」專頁，作一份薄薄的禮物。內中所選刋的幾篇文字，於小朋友們智德體三育上多少有一些貢獻，請小朋友們不要客氣，全都哂納了吧。我們平日雖也非常歡迎小朋友們的大作，承小朋友們不棄紛紛寄來；可是為篇幅有限，不能多登，這是十分抱歉的事情。今天兒童節，為使小朋友們高興起見，因便選登了幾篇特地出一個「兒童園地」專頁。譬如小朋友們在學校開慶祝兒童節的遊藝會的，大家登台表演一番；我們在台下聚精會神看着聽着，準備拍手讚美哩。</p>
<h3 id="c193">怎樣改去惡習慣？ <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，今天我來和諸位談談習慣的問題。</p>
<p>在我們人類的起居飮食，行動言語，各種極平常極普通的行為上，每個人都有一點兒習慣；這習慣如果是良好的，那末他的生活，便也是良好的；如果他的習慣是不規則的，那末他的生活，也是不規則的。比如某某人，他習慣於早起身，愛淸潔，勤讀書，戒除零食，節儉用錢，你想，這是不是一種良好的生活習慣呢？有着這種種良好的生活習慣的小孩子，誰會不喜歡他的？在學校是一個好學生，在家裏是一個好子弟，這是一件最有面子的事情，而這些光榮的面子，又是全靠着有良好的生活習慣得來的。</p>
<p>比如你們同級裏，又有一位小朋友，每天上頭一課都因為起來得晏而遲到，那末敎師和同學，會不會稱讚他呢？每决背書默書都背不出默不出，因為他不肯用功勤讀的緣故，你們要不要取笑他呢？又因他不知淸潔，時常在面孔上，衫襟上弄上一大塊墨汚，又在衣袖上揩着一團團的鼻涕，你們厭惡不厭惡他呢？如果他毫不曉得和愛待人，常常為了些小事情，便駡起同學來，你們喜歡不喜歡他呢？我想，像這樣一個可憎的人，你們不見得會喜歡他的吧？你知道他為什麽不為你們所喜歡呢？這就是不良的生活習慣害了他的，因為他沒有養成好習慣呀！</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，看見我上面說的兩個例子，大家心裏一定有八九分明白的了，現在我更加多說兩句，就是習慣不是生來就有的，是一件一件的學上來的。習慣都在小時候養成，所以小時候，對於凡百行為，都要當心，要時時問問自己：「我做的事情，是良好的呢？或者是不良好的呢？」如果覺得是不良的，要馬上改過來，不要馬虎下去，倘然一馬虎，將來便成了一種惡習慣，再要改，那時也就非常艱難了。</p>
<p>好的孩子們，他會時常自己檢點，不會給惡習慣所害的。</p>
<h3 id="c194">怎樣研究科學？ <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>在現代做人，對於各項科學應略具門徑；而涉獵各項科學這一步工作，尤須從兒童時期做起。</p>
<p>有人說：兒童的頭腦簡單，所以兒童不容易學習科學。</p>
<p>正因為兒童的頭腦簡單，所以兒童比成人更易於接近科學。科學不是別的，只是使特殊事件發生的條件的硏究。從兒童的簡單的頭腦看來，任何事情都是特殊的，都足以引起他的好寄心與求知的欲望。日月星辰，雷電風雨，以至如放在火上的鍋子裏的水會沸騰與一塊石頭會墜下之類的日常事件，對於深熟世故的成人，大抵是不必求解的當然的事情，但對於天眞無邪的兒童，未有不引起他的「怎樣發生」的疑問的。懷疑是硏究科學的唯一重要條件；善於懷疑的兒童當然比成人更易自然地學習科學。使兒童獲得科學知識的機會是很多的。怎樣利用這些機會給兒童灌輸科學知識，乃是負敎導兒童之職的成人的責任。</p>
<p>也有人說：科學乾燥乏味，非兒童的天性所喜。</p>
<p>這話更大謬不然。只要敎導得法，科學不但常於趣味，而且具有為兒童的天性所喜的童話中的美麗的仙境。</p>
<p>「林中睡美人」是兒童愛聽的童話之一。在這個故事中，仙人一怒之下，行使了他的魔法。於是宮中的公主，廐中的馬，庭前的犬，屋頂的鴿，廚房中的廚夫，以及皇帝皇后所有的廷臣，都中了他的魔法而睡着了。宮廷的周圍長出一帶堅密的籬笆，宮廷的內部變得如死一般沈寂。直到過了一百年，一個勇武的王子來到，披戴鮮艷的花裳的一座荊棘的籬笆在他面前解了圍；王子走入宮廷，到公主酣睡着的室中，一個甘美的接吻，頓使伊和伊周圍的人物都蘇甦。</p>
<p>在科學中也有與此彷彿的神仙故事嗎？有的。水是世上非常忙碌非常活動的東西。或則奔流河中，或則衝激石上，或從噴泉飛濺，或從屋頂滴瀝，風吹池面時則又縐成漩漪。可是，這麽忙碌這麼活動的水有時竟會驟然中了魔法而變得完全靜止不動的。在一個嚴寒的冬日早晨，開窗一望，昨日還在屋旁奔流的河水如今靜止不動了，被河水衝激的石頭被包圍在聲硬的冰塊當中了。池上的漣漪停止了動蕩。從屋頂滴瀝的水點變成透明的冰柱。每一株樹上都有如水晶一般的一粒一粒的水珠在哪裏打盹。噴泉變成一株玻璃樹，倒懸着許多透明的長形的有尖端的葉子。原來牠們都中了「冰凍仙人」的魔法，他牢牢地把「冰」緊握着，不讓牠溜走。</p>
<p>過了幾星期，也許過了幾天，也許只過了幾小時，勇武的太陽照臨大地。灰黯的雲霧在他面前消散了，有如故事中的籬笆在王子面前　解了：陽光和冰凍的水接了一個溫和的吻，牠就溶解了，有如王子的甘美的接吻蘇甦了公主。於是河水又奔流了，水點又滴瀝了，噴泉又飛濺了，在明朗而溫暖的陽光之下一切都回復了生命。</p>
<p>在科學中，如童話一般的美麗動聽的故事，多至不勝枚舉。誰說科學是乾燥乏味的。</p>
<p>科學的領域無窮，人生的壽命有限，有志硏究科學的小朋友，切　錯過從早學習的機會！</p>
<h3 id="c195">怎樣使你的作文進步？ <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 柳思雋</p>
<p>小朋友：你們在學校中國文一科，得分最少的，大概總是作文吧。你們也許以為作文是艱難的，共實不然。這裏且來吿訴你們一些使作文進步的方法罷。</p>
<p>從前人早已說過，要國文好，作文做得　，應該多看多讀多作，不過怎樣多看多讀多作，還是有商量的餘地的。</p>
<p>多看　應該看什麽東西呢？我以為要作文進步，不應該只看國文，應該無論什麽書都看。為什麽呢？因為作文所以代表言語，講話必須要有所知道，然後能講得出，所以作文也得有所知道然後能做得出，要有所知道，便要多看各種的書，單看國文，知道的是有限的。</p>
<p>多讀　這一法就應該多讀國文書了。因為多看是求多得知識，所以範圍要廣，多讀不只在求知識，並且還要研究他的結構，句法，辭藻。換句話說：就是不只求其內容，並且還要研究他的形式；那就是文字。國文書的文學——比較講究一些，所以多讀限於國文。</p>
<p>多作　多作那就要除了學校中的作文之外，還應該自動的習作。自動的習作，與其多作幾篇長文，還不如只作日記有益。為什麽呢？因為在你們這時候，見聞不廣，思想幼稚，作文必感困難，日記則不限題目，不論長短，只要你有一些感想或見聞雜事，便可下筆。所以借此練習丈字，作日記，是最好的一法。</p>
<p>此外要使作文進步，還須練習二件事情：一·觀察，二·思索。觀察所以使你增加識見；思索所以鍜練你的思想。二者都是使作文進步不可少的要素。</p>
<h3 id="c196">怎樣選擇故事書？ <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>現在坊間所流行的故事書，大致總不外下述的三種：　神怪故事，　名人故事，　科學故事。</p>
<p>神怪故事之中，分着二種：一種是正式的書坊中所發行的，都是風老人，雪姑娘，猴子哥哥，白兎妹妹，以及月宮仙境，海島神山等故事。還有一種是不正式的書舖所印行？而由門板書攤發售的劍仙，俠客，狐精，妖怪等故事。</p>
<p>名人故事之中，包含着中外古今的名人，如政治家，科學家，探險家，忠臣，孝子，烈女等等。但同時，也有很多是以中國傳統的封建思想為中心而編成的。</p>
<p>科學故事，因為是兒童的讀物，所以也有很多是為引起兒童的閱讀興趣起見，故意把科學原理，說得過分的神奇。但自然也有是很合理的。</p>
<p>最近，據一位在書業中服務的朋友吿訴我，「神怪故事的銷路最好，名人故事，次之，但只及神怪故事的百分之十五，科學故事，除了說得過於神奇，近乎魔術的，偶然還能銷掉幾本之外，合理的科學故事，簡直的沒人問鼎，出版之後，永無再版的可能。」</p>
<p>接着，我叉遇到一位當小學校長的朋友，和他談起小學生閱讀故事的問題，他說，「初年級的小學生，專愛讀風老人，雪姑娘一類的故事。高年級的，愛讀劍仙俠客。這幾乎是小學生界的普遍現象。名人故事，和科學故事是强迫着高年級的小學生閱讀的，但瞧着他們似乎是毫無興趣的，總沒有讀神怪故事的那麽有味。」</p>
<p>為甚麽毫無意義的神怪故事，大家偏那麽愛讀，越有價値的故事，如名人故事，科學故事，偏不受小朋友們的歡迎呢？</p>
<p>這雖然是一個小問題，但我覺得這對於小朋友的前途，是有相當的嚴重性的，所以特地提出來，求敎育家們，設法糾正呀。</p>
<h3 id="c197">怎樣組織「讀書聯誼會」？ <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 增庚</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，當你們在課餘之後，當你們在星期日或是休假的時候，你們不是感覺到獨自一個人讀書的單調和乏味嗎？我知道，你們亦曾經因為一個人的自修而提不起興趣，亦曾經因為一個人的讀書而發生對於書本上不能得到明瞭的困難。現在我願發起一個「小朋友讀書聯誼會」，來帮助你們解决困難，來調劑着你們的單調。</p>
<p>這個「小朋友讀書聯誼會」，我們有二人以上就可以成立了。我們並不需要收會費等等，只要每人拿出自己的書本，擇一個比較淸靜的地方，大家在一起看，讀，寫，以及作敎師要我們在課外作的功課，有不能明瞭的地方，我們互相的研究討論，如遇不能解决的問題，我們可以暫為保留，去求父母師長們的指敎。</p>
<p>除去了讀書的互相硏討以外，我們還要在勞作方面求合作，我們還要在友誼方面求聯絡。一個小團體，就是社會的一個縮影，過慣了團體的合羣生活，那麽將來踏進社會，就不會感覺到生疏了。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我把「小朋友讀書聯誼會」的簡章，擬些在下面：</p>
<p>一，定名—小朋友讀書聯誼會。</p>
<p>一，宗旨—以研討學識，聯絡感情，養成團體生活的習慣為宗旨。</p>
<p>一，會員—如品格端正，有志求學者，均得為本會會員。</p>
<p>一，組織本會設會長一人，負召集之職，幹事二人，負會中佈置之職。</p>
<p>一，導師—本會得聘請家長師長各一人為導師，負敎導之責。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，看了上面五條很簡單的章程，我想决不是一件很艱難的事情吧？盼望你們今後自己去邀幾個同學，或是鄰居的小朋友們，大家一齊來着手凖備，組織成一個很健全的「小朋友讀書聯誼會」，來努力着你們學識的硏討，感情的聯絡，以及團體生活習慣的養成。</p>

<p>— 上海巿立培本小學學生黃儒坤</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友啊！</p>
<p>兒童節到了，我們要怎樣去紀念它呢？是不是把你們爸爸媽媽給你們的錢，買些好吃的糖果，請請你們的好朋友。或者邀幾個小朋友到家裏，開個小小的慶祝會去紀念它。可是這不是紀念兒童節的眞諦，都是耗費金錢與光陰的，無意識的舉動，那末我們要怎樣去紀念它呢？</p>
<p>在這國難當頭奇恥未雪的今日，我希望小朋友們，從今年兒童節起，立志做一個有作有為的好學生，用我們的冷靜的頭腦，敏銳的目光，和玲瓏的手腕，努力求知，努力工作，為中華民國培養一分原氣，為中華民族創造一分光榮，為人類社會刷去斑斑汚點，才不負今日的兒童節。</p>

<p>吳校長說：「你們的成績很好」，自然我們不敢自滿，我們共有報吿六百多張，標本二百餘種，購得書報器械許多種的花，養的魚都長大了。</p>

<p>— 蘇州景海小學學生張懷良</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，你們知道儲蓄的益處嗎？現在我來講一件故事給你們聽，像美國的幼童把他們每天的吃糖果的錢儲起來，然後再儲到銀行去生利息，不到半年，他們的儲蓄金，巳經積了三百萬金元，就把這筆欵造了一雙很夭的軍艦，軍艦的名宇，就呌亞美利加的幼童，這一種是靠着他們儲蓄，但是講到儲蓄先要節儉和决心。</p>
<p>最後，我要吿訴諸位小朋友們，先要節儉，否則把所餘下來的錢都化了。現在我想出一種法子，你們到鉛皮店裏去做一隻儲蓄盒子，把餘下來的錢放在裏面，積滿了幾元，便儲到銀行去生利息，這不是一舉兩得嗎，勸諸位小朋友快去實行吧！</p>

<p>— 上海民生小學學生謝吉庭</p>
<p>有一個農夫，當他種好了田回來的時候，他走過一條水溝，看見有一條大肚皮的雌蛇，想過水溝，過不過去。他就用鋤頭帮忙它托過去，雌蛇回到洞裏，對雄蛇說：「我方才遇了危險，生命幾乎送掉。」雄蛇說：「怎麼會幾乎送掉性命呢？」雌蛇說：「我過水溝的時候，一個農夫用鋤頭要打我，幸虧我逃得快，否則被他打死了。「雄蛇說：「晚上我準替你報仇好了。」</p>
<p>到了晚上，他就尋到農夫家裏，伏在農夫的床頂，等機會。恰巧農夫的妻子也是大肚皮，伊上床睡覺的時候爬不上去，農夫便帮忙伊送上床去。農夫並且將他在路上帮助那大肚皮蛇過水溝的事，一五一十的說給妻子聽。雄蛇在床頂上聽見這話，知道雌蛇說誑非常生氣，回到洞裏，便把雌蛇咬死了。</p>

<p>— 上海靑華小學學生徐梅先</p>
<p>我們校裏有一條很嚴的校規：「便是不准隨意吐痰」。先生吿訴我們說：「痰是最不潔的東西，它裏面含有細菌。如果一個病人吐的痰，被風吹乾之後，那細菌就隨着空氣飛揚，吸進人們的口鼻，達到肺管裏面了。」所以，痰是傳染病的媒介，而且有了吐痰的習慣，往往呌人厭惡。一天有個學生，他忘記了這條校規，呼的一聲，把一口痰吐在地上。像這種情形，我想最好我們要罰他掃一星期的地，倒一星期的痰盂，可使他們受了這種的敎訓，便可痛改前非，把痰吐在痰盂裏。要是不看見痰盂，身邊每一個人要預備一張紙，這樣呢！如人人照着做，從此以後，便養成了他們良好的習慣了。</p>

<h3 id="c217">敬吿全國兒童書 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>兒童節來了，照例又是一番熱閙，大人先生們也在興高采烈地開會，行禮如儀，擴大慶祝。但是，如果有不識趣的人問：這樣子與兒童有什麼好處？那才是天曉得。這個，我們暫時帶住了吧，我們先來談談這一隊英勇的「西湖兒童旅行團」的奇跡，以對兒童節致敬。</p>
<p>讀者相信不會善忘吧。三月二十九日從杭州翁家山小學開來了十個小學生，在南火車站和上海人士會見了。奇怪的是他們都是未成年的小孩子，最長的一個也不過是十五歲的女孩子。他們不要成人領導，他們完全是自動的組織。他們的目的，是為了「不願永遠困守在籠子似的學校裏，閉塞的山村裏」，而「要以廣大的社會當學校，廣大的羣衆做先生。要走進各種不同的社會，經騐各種不同的生活，接觸各種不同的人物，學習各種不同的知能」，所以才到上海來的。他們的經費也是平日做小先生的日記賣得來的稿費，而且帶來的只有八十塊錢，恐怕不够，還帶來了一本他們自己寫的「普及敎育經騐談」預備賣掉換來了旅費。同時，他們更大的原因，是試試離開父母家庭學校，有沒有自治的能力；而他們到上海的目的，不是為了這裏的車水馬龍以及窮奢極侈的繁華，而是看看社會各階層人物的痛苦，和被侵略被壓迫至什末地步。這幾天他們正在實現他們的理想，到各地參觀，也許在四月五日便又回學校去了。對於這樣一個旅行團，我們會發生怎樣感想？尤其是一班兒童專家們。</p>
<p>在三月三十日他們還發了一個「敬吿全國兒童書」，但是道個宣言到現在我們還沒有看見在報上發表，不過便算是不看那宣言，我們也可以理會那宣言的力量了，因為他們本身的「行動」，便是一篇最强有力的話「敬吿全國兒童書」。這不用「事實」寫成的「宣言」，不特敎訓了全國昏迷迷的有錢孩子，和書獃子的不懂事的小學生，幷且還老老實實地敎訓了一般又在理論上下工夫，完全不去替兒童實際設想的所謂兒童敎育專家。他替中國的兒童，開闢了一條光明的道路。</p>
<p>最後，我們再伸述這一個活的「敬吿全國兒童書」的意義，幷向兒童節提出一個議案：在這樣的一個民族危急關頭裏，便是小學生也不應該埋着頭在課室裹書本子裏，他把要讀活的書，要讀以社會做課本的書。同時，我們需要的兒童敎育，是配合翁這個國難非常時期的兒童敎育，養成兒童對社會的正確認識，及充份發揮兒童的能力；而不是一般官僚式貴族式的敎育。要替兒童謀幸福的先生們，請澈底一些吧！不要在花樣番新上加工夫了。</p>
<h3 id="c218">兩母女 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>因為要從一個同鄕的店中搬出，我便到埋埋街去找房子。這街，是在一個荒曠的地段，Manila人呌它是貧民區。是一條　　　，終年堆滿垃圾，塵埃和光頭赤足髒孩子的沙土路。從街頭直到街尾只有四五間小得可憐的「菜仔店」吵架，扭打，却是常有的。</p>
<p>轉過埋埋橋，我便放緩了脚步慢慢的走着，這注意兩旁的店舖：是否有貼召租字樣的房子。終於在街的盡頭給我發</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>現了一家，門口貼着張歪歪斜斜地寫着：Room　to　Let召租紙條的房子。於是我便在這家房子附近跑着，看看有沒有什麽，便跑近門去敲着。這樣過有了四五分鐘之久，才聽見一個破嗓子從裏面直吆喝出來，接着門於是也啊的開了。是一個跛了一足，挂了拐杖的老太婆。我向她說明了來意，她向我上下打量了一下，便請我進去。</p>
<p>雖然她是跛了一足的老婆子，爬起樓梯來却很敏捷，一點也不像有教病的樣子。她絮絮叨叨地這爬着那腐蝕了的樓梯，一邊用歎息的聲調訴說着：</p>
<p>我們底房子，先生，包管你一看便滿意，光綫和空氣都是在埋埋街踏破了鐵鞋沒處找的。至於寄往的，只有我們一家，母女兩個，沒有孩子會吵鬧你的。……，她便帶我到一間房子外站着，輕輕地用拐杖在地板上敲着，向前廂房溫和地呌道：蒂拉！有客人來看房子，快把房子的鎖匙帶出來。</p>
<p>前廂房裏有一個清脆的聲音回答着，接着便是一陣細膩的拖鞋聲，一個十五六歲的女孩子半裸着跑了出来。她向我微微地點着頭，我也忙着回點了頭，面上感動啊有點溫熱。</p>
<p>房子看了，現在是輪到我們講價錢的時候了，她們一開口就要五隻洋一個月，我說；「見鬼！這是什麽樣的一條街道，這又是什麽樣的房子，一個月要五隻洋」。老太婆着急了，便重重的敲着拐杖，啞者嗓子道：「先生你要看淸楚啊！這是好空氣，好光綫的哩，而且我們是沒有孩子的，乾乾淨淨兩母女。」……，</p>
<p>我接着說：「老太太這我老早就知道了，不過房租是在太貴點，我吃不消」！於是我準備着拿起帽子。說聲對不起，跑了。老太婆焦急地站起來忙把我底帽子按住，又把房價直减到三隻半洋。我想想倒也差不多，便答應下。放了一隻定洋，說晚上搬進去，便走了</p>
<p>晚上，我雇了一輪馬車，把一箱書，兩件破行李，一綑被蓋搬進去，嶄新的獨立生活便開始。</p>
<p>過了幾天，這兩個孤苦的母女底生活問題，漸漸地引起我底注意，而且很快地便感到了興趣。那個失誤六歲的女孩子，是整天坐在家裏的，跛足的老太婆陪着她。白天坐在後亭子間看書看得倦了，我便常靜坐默聽從前廂房傳來的哄笑聲。吟味，硏究着它底意義。這笑聲有時從那個跛脚老太婆的破嗓子發出的是特別嚮亮，間也雜以敲拐杖，和蹈足聲，這顯然是有什麽可笑的事使得她手舞足蹈起來了。</p>
<p>一陣笑聲過後，我便又恨淸晰地聽到了那個好孩子的聲音，她大聲地，用着嚴肅的姿勢說道：「……於是保羅便開始了他英勇的航行。這航行很費他底苦心，因為上帝為着要試騐他是否有不變的信心，便差遣了許多行使雷，雨，風，電的神們，使海島的風浪大作：但是保羅一點也不膽戰，他堅决，他英勇地駕御着那隻舟邁開了洶湧的波濤前進。終於那個珊瑚島便被發現，而他也就一下子成為世界上無二的富豪了。……」</p>
<p>這段冒險故事的敘述，使跛足的老太婆感嘆了。因為她底病了的脚，她底拐杖，再也不在地板上敲的答答地嚮了。我相信她一定為那美麗的珊瑚島而神往了。</p>
<p>到了晚上，我出門去吃飯，回來時，前廂房却巳是静寞寞的。再也聽不見跛脚老太婆破嗓子的哄笑，蒂拉冒险故事的叙述。知识一重浓重的沉寂。蒂拉不在了，老太婆则漠然地坐在一隻破沙發上，面孔埋在臂彎　。過分的寂寞也許要使她感到憂鬱，因此她每一回聽到我底脚步聲，便從前廂房拄了拐杖跛出來，向我　　地道着晚安。但當我問她是否也用過晚餐，她底面孔便微微的泛着紅　，慚愧地摇着頭，說「蒂拉巳經出去買了……，</p>
<p>往往在相隔不久，扶梯上走動的脚步聲便嚮了，這是說蒂拉巳經回來：然而不止她一個，還帶有另一個來。這個在街角或什麽地方被帶着來的人，有時是些喝得泥醉的美國水手，有時是吝嗇的馬車夫，有時又是苦力樣的人們。可是這個老太婆却往往故意裝做不知道，我初搬進來的時候不知道這是怎麼一回事常吿着她說：「蒂拉已經回來了」！她便故意用話扯開，用着種種問　把我糾纏住，使我不能專注地去傾聽在這時前廂房內能夠聽到的下流談話，哄笑，和種種令人不快的嚮聲。有時她向我辯論着上帝的存在問題，有時她又向我責問：日本人對於菲律濱有沒有存在着野心？這位老太婆，她是有涵養的，據說從前也是大戶人家出身，後來沒落了。</p>
<p>當我們底談論有時中止時，我便能夠清晰地聽到了前廂房種種異動和聲息。有時是蒂拉底低弱的訴苦和鳴咽，有時是喘息和淫猥的浪語。在這時，老太婆沉默着，她底＼心是被愁苦啃傷了。</p>
<p>末了，這些暴徒被送走了，蒂拉等了一會也跟着出去：可是她很快，便又回来，輕輕地敲着我們底房門，用一種犯罪的怯弱的聲調說道：媽媽，麵包買來了！</p>
<p>老太婆忙溫和的答應着，有回頭向我抱歉地說道：對不住，先生，今晚多有吵擾你。……又道着晚安，才悄然地，像一匹被趕逐着的，鼠兒似的跛出去。</p>

<p>— 雷石楡</p>
<p>吃茶·酒塲·咖啡</p>
<p>隨便走進任何的街上，如果你的耳朶正是直接着從窗裏或半掩的門縫流出的留聲機的音浪的波動的時候，朋友，要是沒有趕辦急事的話，或者有那種感覺的興味的話，那末，請緩弛一下步武，（就是站那麼一刹那也不要緊的），偏過頭瞥瞥那門扉上或那門額的一角的像看守衙門的丘八似的牌示上有沒有「吃茶」或「純吃茶」等的字樣。不，就是初到東京的人也不會那麼呆頭呆腦站着端詳的，那些字樣不是遠遠可望見的麼，而且那洋式的門面已顯示一種特色的標記。那麼，乾脆點說，要是高興的話，請進去休息多少時候吧。當你正要走進去的時候，那麼笑容可鞠的或倚在門旁或正「迎頭趕上」去招呼你的年少茶女，用柔有彈力而淸婉的腔調呌着：</p>
<p>——伊列勢！（請進來）</p>
<p>裏面排列着簡樸二雅潔的桌子，講究點的話，還有沙發椅子給你坐的。你喜歡什麽就喝什麽吧，有紅茶，咖啡，檸檬，……。不必講究斯文或裝闊佬，喝一角或角半一杯的什麽，坐一兩個鐘頭也聽你的便。有各種音樂給你滌耳且不用說，也有報紙什麽給你遊目的。不聽不看也吧，獨自呆坐着也没有人笑，假如嫌寂寞，約一兩位朋友或跟慣熟的茶女談笑談笑也可以。因為那些客人不過是學生，文士或有閒階級者，他們不會發生什麽驚擾的，可放心坐下去。</p>
<p>聽說十月革命前後的期間，俄國的詩人們常在吃茶店朗讀詩或談論的問題</p>
<p>但東京的吃茶店，至少也具有供一般小布爾消閒的功用。</p>
<p>如果碰見樣式差不多，但門面更裝煌，規模也更大，而字樣標識着：Cafe或「洋酒」的這樣的處所時，至少先要估量一下口袋裏的　蓄才好，進去的時候，不可太斯文，也不可太壯闊佬，太斯文的話，咖啡文會把你當做傻瓜似的調笑，太裝闊佬，會在　　的臂上，嚦嚦的　間迷失了吝嗇的感覺。就是以平常的姿態也要準備應付差不多輪流似的來伴坐或對坐的她們那『我要杯什麽』或臨別時『請給點小　我吧』等的要求。</p>
<p>那是卑賤的生活吞噬了她們的廉恥，磨練狡黠的技術。</p>
<p>進咖啡店的人，也至少能滿足她們的欲求的全部或一部才算合格似的</p>
<p>「洋酒」也差不多，或更使人陶醉也說不定，因為「酒」的力量比「咖啡」的力量還强烈似的。雖然在咖啡店裏面喝的也是各種各樣的酒。不過我不嗜酒，對那樣的經騐也很不充分，只還記得曾見過一兩次五顏六色的衣裝，般紅的唇兒，桃花樣的頰兒……。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhangjiakou News: The pseudo-army under Li Shouxin, which has occupied six counties in northern Chahar, Guyuan, Baochang, Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, and Huade, totaling more than 3,000 people, has recently been busy transferring troops southward and appears to be peering into Zhangjiakou. Most of the lower-ranking officers in the army are from a certain country, and all orders are given in a certain country's language. Recently, they have also used a certain country's script to compose military songs and forced soldiers to sing them, with extremely absurd wording. Also, many people from a certain country have recently arrived in Duolun from northern Chahar and are stationed in the office of Dongmiao Zhuotebazhapu, spreading rumors in all directions, inciting Mongolian autonomy under the pretext of preventing communism.

<h3 id="e7">Children's Day of the Children's Year <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Today is the National Children's Day, and this year is also the National Children's Year. The emotion is deep and the meaning is doubled. The central government has issued a general order to various places to expand the celebration, in order to refresh people's minds and make them fully aware that children are the hope of the future and bear the mission of promoting what is beneficial and eliminating what is harmful. On this day, we should nurture their education, protect their health, guide their thinking, and correct their words and deeds so that they can form a sound and complete personality to meet the country's earnest needs. To ensure the effectiveness of this maintenance, it depends on the spirit of coordination and the division of responsibilities among school teachers and family fathers and brothers. Looking at today's social phenomena, it seems that it is still not possible to achieve what people want, so I will take this opportunity to reiterate.</p>
<p>Historically, parents regarded children as private property, disregarded the principles of education, and used their emotions to control them based on their likes, dislikes, loves, and hates. They judged right and wrong based on their own opinions. Sometimes they abused their power and cut off children's lively functions. Sometimes they indulged in cooing and nurturing, cultivating laziness in their children. When affectionate, they were like pearls in their palms. When angry, they were like objects for venting. Those who can truly take care of the children's personality and guide them towards a correct and reasonable direction are rare. Even now, in this era of ideological change, ordinary people no longer adhere to the concept of children as private property as they did in the past, but their methods of thorough education are still mostly lacking. It is true that family environments vary greatly, and the minds of fathers and brothers are inevitably different. Hard-working people often suffer from the inability to care for their children, while leisurely husbands often indulge in self-abandonment. Who would be willing to express their comprehensive awareness and anticipate their children's future plans? At most, they would carefully find a suitable school and transfer the responsibility of education to others. As for primary school organizations, they are vast in urban areas and numerous in rural areas. However, seeking pure and complete ones is like searching for treasure from sand, which is extremely rare. The reason for this is that social habits have failed to attach importance to primary school teachers. Those with superior skills and intelligence often turn their heads and refuse to take the job. Even if they occasionally take on the role, they are still displeased and unwilling to understand the children's personalities with a love for education. In terms of managing school affairs, they are also uneven. Some take profit as a prerequisite, while others take following the old ways as ability. The curriculum is not well-adjusted, and management is difficult to anticipate. This allows a large number of children to mingle with good and bad, and the gradual contamination is inevitable. Looking at the overall situation, isn't it worrying?</p>
<p>The purpose of the Children's Year is to seek the overall welfare of children. Even in today's loud calls, there is still a phenomenon of wrist-cutting. It should be something that wise authorities are deeply concerned about. The way to remedy this is that the authorities should, within the scope of possibility, do their best to increase primary school funding, strictly select school organizations and provide subsidies, and assess teachers' abilities at any time and improve their salaries. They must ensure that the mediocre do not have the opportunity to muddle through and that talented people can devote themselves to teaching and school affairs can be fully developed. Children have good gains, and the knowledge class should also remind the attention of the family fathers and brothers, so that they can work together with the school teachers to seek the balanced development of children. At the same time, they should also set an example, be good at taking and giving up, avoid useless actions, and prevent bad impressions. In this way, children's thinking will become sounder day by day, and the future of the country will depend on it.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Gao Guizi arrived in Peiping by Eurasia aircraft from Zhengcheng at 11:20 this morning. According to reports, Shaanxi-Shanxi transportation has now been restored. Zhujia Chuan is an important military crossing, formerly defended by the 5th Brigade of the Shanxi Army. After the bandits entered Shanxi, the Shanxi Army withdrew, and it is now defended by this division. In Shaanxi, only Liu Zidan is a large bandit gang, numbering about 3,000 people. The remaining bandits number about 10,000 in total. They are scattered. Zhang Xueliang has ordered that the remaining bandits be eliminated within one month. Northern Shaanxi has barren land and poor people, and there is a lack of food. After the communist bandits arrived, they greatly requisitioned civilian food, with six-eighths as public grain and four-tenths as civilian grain, causing the people to distrust them and surrender in droves. Now, military villages are being established with residential bases, and each team is setting up a fortress every ten li to implement armed protection for the returning people. However, this is a political problem. There are more than a thousand bandits in northern Shanxi who have entered the mountains, and more than a thousand in western Shanxi who are small gangs. Hongdong, Zhao County, and other places in Shanxi are large gangs and are being suppressed. Xu Xiangqian's bandits are still in Sichuan.

Eden also gave another letter, which reportedly mentioned that the scope of the talks between the general staffs of France and Britain should be limited to politics. In addition, the mutual obligations stipulated in the first letter will only take effect after the governments of Britain, France, and Belgium decide that mediation has failed. Eden will announce his views on the German government's reply in the House of Commons today. Eden met with German Special Envoy Ribbentrop yesterday. Ribbentrop also held a meeting with Vansittart, the permanent head of the Foreign Office. It is reported that Ribbentrop will stay in London for several days. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Based on the draft agreement established at the Locarno Conference on March 19, the British government will send letters to France and Belgium to guarantee the security of each country. Foreign Secretary Eden handed over these letters to French Ambassador Corbin and Belgian Ambassador Machian at 6:15 PM this afternoon. In addition, another letter stating that the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium should immediately begin contact in accordance with Article 3 of the Locarno Agreement draft was also delivered at the same time. (Note: Article 3 of the draft agreement states that during the transition period, in order to implement the mutual assistance provisions of the Locarno Treaty, the general staffs of the countries concerned should hold talks to maintain the effectiveness of the treaty until a new treaty is established to replace the original Locarno Treaty.) The government has now decided to compile these letters and various documents related to the talks between the general staffs of the three countries into a White Paper and submit it to the House of Commons tomorrow. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that the letter that the British government should put forward to guarantee the security of France and Belgium in accordance with the Locarno draft agreement has been sent by British Foreign Secretary Eden to French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. The content of this letter is very similar to the original wording of the draft agreement. In addition, another letter was also sent at the same time as the previous letter, which defines the meaning and scope of the talks that should be held between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium. In short, (that is, the participating countries cannot give rise to any new political obligations, and the military organizations of the countries concerned are also not affected by this (referring to Britain's unwillingness to take any preparatory measures in national defense, such as adopting conscription)). After receiving the letter from the British government, Ambassador Corbin to Britain submitted two reply letters to British Foreign Secretary Eden. The first letter stated that the British letter had been received and that the wording of the letter was copied to show that the security guarantee has now become a relative mutual assistance system. The second letter on the meaning and scope of the talks between the general staffs of the three countries also follows the wording of the British letter. However, the above exchange of letters did not specify the date for the talks between the general staffs. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e59">British Foreign Secretary Explains the Diplomatic Situation to the House of Commons; Will Do His Best to Promote Peace Negotiations <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the German reply in the House of Commons today, saying that the events of the past few days are divided into two categories: one is related to the German government's letter stating the new European peace plan, and the other is related to the exchange of documents between the governments of Britain, France, and Belgium involving the White Paper of March 19. On April 1, German Special Envoy Ribbentrop went to the Foreign Office to deliver the German reply. Yesterday, he told Ribbentrop that the British government only had time for a preliminary study of Germany's recent proposals and will continue to study them because it believes they are very important and should be carefully reviewed. He also told him that Britain's goal is to make negotiations progress so as to promote a final solution, and Britain will do its best to achieve this goal. Please convey this to Hitler. However, Germany has not yet adopted the British government's idea for an interim period.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary then declared to the House of Commons that the future talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium will not increase Britain's political obligations. These talks only involve the interim period when negotiations are not in progress and are purely technical in nature. The British government has explained to the governments of France and Belgium that the letter sent to France and Belgium yesterday, which re-stated Britain's obligation to uphold the Locarno Treaty, does not contain the intention of Britain recognizing that reconciliation has failed. The talks between the general staffs will begin in London, and the date has not yet been determined, but they will be held as soon as the necessary arrangements have been made. The main purpose of Britain's decision to hold talks between the general staffs is only to help restore trust. The British government believes that these talks will not hinder the solution. In answering Lloyd George's question, the British Foreign Secretary said that military plans will never be implemented unless France or Belgium is attacked without provocation. In answering a question from Conservative Party member Esther, the British Foreign Secretary said that although British overseas autonomous territories are not signatories to the Locarno Treaty, the British government will inform them in detail of the various processes of the negotiations. As for the fact that Italy had written to France and Belgium in the capacity of guarantor of the Locarno Treaty, stating that it was willing to uphold the obligations of the Locarno Treaty, which was the same as that issued by Britain yesterday, he had not heard of it. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons held a meeting today, and Captain Peter MacDonald, a Conservative Party member, asked the government about the talks that should be held between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium. Prime Minister Baldwin answered them one by one. The Prime Minister also declared that regarding the situation caused by the German memorandum, Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to attend the House of Commons at 11:00 AM tomorrow to issue a declaration. The questions and answers between MacDonald and the Prime Minister are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(MacDonald asked) Is Italy going to participate in the talks that should be held between the general staffs of the countries concerned?</p>
<p>(Prime Minister replied) The general staff talks that the British government currently agrees to participate in are those held jointly with the general staffs of France and Belgium. As for the fact that the Italian government is planning to hold the same talks with France and Belgium, the British government has not received any information.</p>
<p>(MacDonald asked) Can these general staff talks be postponed until progress has been made in the negotiations with Germany before they begin?</p>
<p>(Prime Minister replied) The talks that should be held between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium are to discuss the current situation. This has been explained by Foreign Secretary Eden. If negotiations with Germany are to succeed, the trust between the countries concerned must be restored. These general staff talks are an element of restoring trust, so the government cannot agree to the postponement proposal.</p>
<p>(MacDonald asked) Please provide assurances to the House of Commons that these general staff talks must be strictly supervised by the Cabinet, and that the purpose must be limited to defense and must not be developed for war against Germany, as advocated by Louis George, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party.</p>
<p>(Prime Minister replied) I would like to assure you today that the government will supervise these talks effectively and strictly. As for Louis George's claim, it is purely fantasy. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) When British Foreign Secretary Eden met with German Special Envoy Ribbentrop at the Foreign Office yesterday, he raised several questions, which Ribbentrop noted down one by one. He will probably answer verbally after Easter. The main question is, what does Germany mean by saying that if Germany rejoins the League of Nations, it will demand equal colonial rights within a considerable period of time? Does "considerable period" mean half a year, one year, or longer? Does Germany want to recover all or part of its former colonies? Other questions related to the definition of "troops" in the March 7 memorandum of Hitler, including irregular troops and air forces. Eden also asked about Germany's intention to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts with Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, and Austria, and whether Germany wanted to abandon the Hague International Court of Justice and establish a new international court.

<p>German Representative Makes Supplementary Explanation; Targeting the Soviet Union is Obvious</p>
<p>(London) German representative Ribbentrop visited Foreign Office official Sir Westaj at noon and held a long talk. He provided explanations regarding the supplementary explanations requested by the British government on several points in the German memorandum. Afterwards, Ribbentrop spoke with Führer Hitler on a long-distance telephone for a long time. According to people from the German embassy, ​​Ribbentrop will stay in London for several days and has not yet made a decision. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of Germany concluding mutual assistance treaties with neighboring countries, it was recently stated by people close to the German delegation that Germany is only willing to sign such treaties with its western neighbors and is unwilling to conclude them with eastern Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union. It is said that "the policies of these countries are unstable and hostile to each other, forming a confrontation. If Germany were to conclude mutual assistance treaties with them, it might have to act as an arbitrator between these countries, which Germany does not want." Therefore, according to Germany, it is better to sign a general airspace agreement and include the above-mentioned countries. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The full text of the German memorandum was only published here this afternoon. Political figures commented that Führer Hitler's aim is to gain the sympathy of British public opinion, and his tactics are very clever. It is also said that looking at the peace plan proposed in the memorandum, Germany focuses on Western Europe, while in Eastern Europe there is no desire to guarantee security. Its finger is clearly aimed at the Soviet Union. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e62">German Memorandum: Reactions in Paris <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Believed to be of a completely negative nature, sufficient to cause the League of Nations itself to fail.</p>
<p>(Paris) French authorities believe that Hitler's reply to the four-power proposal, in the form of a memorandum, is completely negative. They say that the German proposal would lead to the failure of the collective security and mutual assistance system, as well as the League of Nations itself. The signatories of the Locarno Treaty all believe that before beginning negotiations to reorganize European peace, the international laws broken by Germany must at least be partially restored. However, Germany has now rejected almost all of the proposed plans. The German memorandum disregards the International Court of Justice at The Hague and proposes a new arbitration court, without providing detailed explanations. This action is a major blow to the League of Nations. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The reactions of various circles here to the German reply can be summarized in the following three points: Whether the "Security Pact" proposed in the German reply can be compatible with existing mutual assistance pacts without conflict; The points concerning the restriction of air force actions proposed in the German reply do not seem to be included in the proposed Sky Pact; Germany insists that it can only rejoin the League of Nations if other countries do not intervene in its treaty violations.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin paid a visit to Prime Minister Sarraut at 7:00 PM to discuss the situation created by the German memorandum. The meeting lasted for one hour. Regarding this, responsible officials have declared that Germany clearly believes that the offensive and defensive positions on the eastern and western borders are different. Therefore, the strategies adopted cannot be the same. Once the defensive fortifications on the Rhine River are completed, Germany will not have to worry about interference from Britain and France, and will have no worries about its western flank. Then, it can develop towards Eastern and Central Europe. This must be prevented. As for France, it still advocates peace as a whole and adheres to the principle of collective security. No matter how the international situation develops in the future, France's actions will be based on this attitude. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry stated that the German government's reply and the various suggestions it made are currently being carefully examined by Foreign Minister Flandin and members of the cabinet. No definitive opinions will be expressed for the time being. Political circles here firmly believe that the French government's opinion will not be formally announced until tomorrow at the earliest. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin has telegraphed French ambassadors to Britain, Corbin; Germany, François-Poncet; Italy, Chambrun; and Belgium, Laroche, summoning them back to the country. A meeting will be held at the Foreign Ministry at 3:00 PM tomorrow to discuss the situation created by the German memorandum. Prime Minister Sarraut will also attend the meeting. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministry has summoned ambassadors stationed in the Locarno Pact countries to the capital for a meeting tomorrow. The scope of discussion will be limited to all issues arising from the German reply, so that the ambassadors and officials can avoid discrepancies in their discussions with the governments of their respective host countries on this issue. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun, summoned by French Foreign Minister Flandin, has already set off to return home. It is rumored that Chambrun is carrying Italy's requests, namely the abolition of sanctions so that Italy can morally regain its original status (i.e., no longer be designated as an aggressor nation). If France can accept this, Italy can actively participate in European affairs, otherwise, it will remain neutral. This statement has been acknowledged by responsible parties. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin met with British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps at 5:00 PM to explain the French government's initial impressions of the German memorandum. He said that the memorandum's content is almost entirely negative in nature. Germany's intention is to emphasize bilateral treaty systems while opposing collective mutual assistance systems, which could cause the League of Nations' efforts to organize peace to fail. In addition, Flandin expressed his desire to convene a meeting of the four signatory nations of the Locarno Pact next Tuesday or Wednesday, to be held in Brussels or Paris. Regarding this, it is heard that the British government will submit a reply soon. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>Ethiopia Expresses Doubt Whether Italy's Acceptance of Invitation to Negotiate Peace with the League of Nations is Sincere</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has made three appeals to the League of Nations: Financial assistance; Removal of obstacles that some member states of the League of Nations are still imposing on the transportation of military equipment to the Abyssinian army; Exerting utmost efforts to intensify the current sanctions against Italy to the fullest extent. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, requesting that the League of Nations intensify sanctions against Italy and provide financial assistance to Abyssinia. It stated that although Italy has accepted the application of the Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations Administrative Council and has agreed in principle to begin peace talks, the war continues as before, and the methods of warfare used are extremely brutal. It is hoped that the League of Nations will take prompt action towards the Italian government so that it respects wartime laws. The conclusion states, "It is the important duty of the member states of the League of Nations to make justice prevail over power. The Abyssinian government specifically reiterates this point and hopes that it will not be seen as an extravagant request." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Madariaga, chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations Administrative Council, invited the Italian government yesterday to directly discuss the issue of Italian-Abyssinian peace negotiations with the committee. According to an official announcement, the Italian government has replied that it will comply. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Rome, the Italian government has accepted the invitation from the chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations, Madariaga, to contact the committee to discuss a solution to the East African war. The Abyssinian embassy here expressed doubt about this news, saying, "This news has not been formally confirmed. From our point of view, even if Italy accepts the invitation, its purpose is nothing more than to avoid the implementation of an oil embargo. If the country ceases military action during the negotiation period, then we will believe that it has peaceful intentions." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Although the Italian government has accepted the letter from the chairman of the Committee of Thirteen (the Spanish representative), Madariaga, inviting it to discuss ways to resolve the East African war, the hope of finding a way to end the war quickly under the auspices of the Committee of Thirteen seems very slim. According to political circles here, the plan of the Committee of Five and the proposals agreed upon by Hoare and Laval but abandoned, which were previously regarded as a possible basis for resolving the East African war, are no longer an issue. Regarding the rumor that the Abyssinian Emperor has sent a special envoy to meet with the commander-in-chief of the Italian army, official circles here have denied it. Although it is not widely believed that Mussolini has put forward concrete peace proposals, the French ambassador is now returning to Paris for vacation, and it is generally thought that the ambassador may take this opportunity to inquire about the opinions of his government.

<p>Anti-Italian Sentiment Continues to Reignite, Italy Denies Any Political Motives</p>
<p>(London) The recent victories of the Italian army in Abyssinia, including the capture of Gondar, bringing them closer to the British sphere of influence, have caused concern in Britain. Coupled with the Italian army's brutal methods of warfare, British people, filled with indignation, have seen a resurgence of anti-Italian sentiment. People supporting the League of Nations are now promoting the policy of intensifying sanctions against Italy and have scheduled a large-scale rally on the 9th of this month to call for support. The executive committee of the Federation of Organizations Supporting the League of Nations has also passed a resolution, the core of which is that Italy should immediately cease its war against Abyssinia, and the Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations should decide on effective sanctions to be imposed on Italy, such as an oil embargo, restrictions on oil shipping, and, if necessary, cutting off transportation between Italy and Abyssinia. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Responsible officials here declared today that although the Lake Tana area is within Britain's sphere of influence, Britain need not worry about the Italian army's advance into locations near the lake, because Prime Minister Mussolini will surely be consistent in word and deed and respect British interests in the area. They denied that the Italian army's occupation of the area had any political motives and that the decision to attack was motivated by taking advantage of Britain's focus on the Rhineland issue, leaving it no time to attend to other matters, to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute by force. Officials declared that their motives were purely military in nature. Today's war report stated that in addition to Gondar, the Italian army has also captured the towns of Massatanki and Raffa'i. Many members of the Abyssinian Emperor's Imperial Guard have surrendered to the Italian army. The Abyssinian Emperor is now retreating rapidly towards Taissy. The Italian air force is now attacking Taissy from both the east and west sides, and the air force and artillery are also very active north of Lake Ashangi. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since occupying the city of Gondar in northern Abyssinia, Italy is now only a few dozen kilometers away from Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile. It is rumored that people in the Italian cotton industry have devised a plan to block the lake water to prevent it from flowing into the Blue Nile and its tributaries, thereby harming British cotton planting in British-controlled Egypt and Sudan. This statement has been denied by the semi-official Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, which called it a fabrication and said that the Italian government has accepted and will continue to abide by the restrictions (as stipulated in the 1925 Anglo-Italian Protocol). Therefore, all British interests currently within Abyssinia will remain intact. The above rumors are just a tactic adopted by some newspapers to confuse the public. "It is regrettable that this kind of conspiracy is occurring at this time." (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>The Makhani region, south of Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa and Enba Arraschi, controls the vital routes to Taissy and Addis Ababa, and is of extreme strategic importance, making it a place that both armies must fight for. The gain or loss of this road is enough to determine the victory or defeat of the overall situation. Therefore, the Italian military authorities are threatening the Abyssinian army defending this line with the greatest military force, and almost all of the elite troops assigned to defend this line are the Abyssinian side's best troops, including the Imperial Guard personally commanded by the Abyssinian Emperor, in an attempt to make a final stand. The fierceness of the fighting is unprecedented since the start of the war. The Italian army relies on the shelling of field artillery, the bombing of the air force, and the simultaneous advance of armored vehicles and tanks. As for the Abyssinian army, they use stillness to counter movement, focusing on close combat. The great battle has not yet ended. Military authorities here are quickly mobilizing all reserve soldiers in order to support the Abyssinian army on the front lines. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<p>Asmara. According to news from the Italian military headquarters, a fierce battle took place between the Italian and Abyssinian armies in the Lake Ashangi area in northern Abyssinia on the 31st of last month. As a result, the Italian army won a great victory. In this battle, Italian officers and soldiers suffered approximately 1,200 casualties. The Abyssinian army suffered heavy casualties, and even Minister of Posts and Communications Makos was killed. The Italian air force was extremely active in this battle. The day was foggy, and all aircraft had to fly at low altitude, so 17 aircraft were hit by various types of Abyssinian bullets, four of which were heavily damaged. However, only three air force personnel were injured. After the battle, all aircraft returned to their bases. It seems that the Imperial Guard commanded by the Abyssinian Emperor is concentrated in the Mali an Achangi Mahakchi area northeast of Lake Ashangi. It is possible that the Abyssinian Emperor intends to fight the Italian army again, but some believe that after this heavy blow, the Abyssinian Emperor may decide to sue for peace with the Italian army. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. The government recently issued a communique stating that on the 31st of last month, Abyssinian troops in the north attacked the Mai Kiwote Batta area, and four of the seven small fortresses set up by the Italian army were captured by the Abyssinian army. Two hundred Italian white soldiers and one thousand indigenous troops were killed. On the 1st of this month, Abyssinian troops in the north engaged the Italian army again. The Italian army was unable to resist and retreated in defeat, leaving behind 500 corpses, including 36 officers and 200 indigenous soldiers, as well as many machine guns and several cannons. On the Abyssinian side, a total of 887 soldiers were killed and 345 were injured. From this point of view, although the Italian artillery fire was extremely fierce, the Abyssinian army was still able to achieve a great victory. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Asmara. According to news from the Italian military headquarters, small teams of Abyssinian troops have recently attempted to infiltrate the Italian front lines in Bameikang and Zaifdi in the north, but they have all been repelled by the Italian army and suffered heavy losses. In addition, a large number of Abyssinian deserters have come to the Italian front lines to surrender, most of whom are members of the Abyssinian Emperor's Imperial Guard. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Vienna) After the Lower House passed the "Federal Compulsory Service" law yesterday, the government issued a semi-official announcement, detailing the implementation regulations of this law. It stated that 40,000 men born in 1915 should be conscripted in two phases in October of this year and April of next year. The term of service is six months, except for those with reserve officer candidate qualifications. Men born before 1915 and up to 1900 will be conscripted successively, with a term of service of one to two months. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic. Regarding Austria's adoption of the Labor and Military Service Law, the governments of the three Little Entente countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania) are constantly contacting each other by telephone to decide on their attitude.

However, it is still unknown whether this protest will be jointly issued by the three countries or separately. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Little Entente countries today notified Western European countries, stating that if Hungary follows in Austria's footsteps and implements the restoration of conscription, the Little Entente countries will take military action. According to observations here, this statement by the Little Entente countries is due to two concerns: first, they are deeply concerned that the defeated countries in the previous World War will rise up again to recover their lost territories; second, they are deeply concerned about the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty; and third, they are deeply concerned that Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria will form a group to endanger peace in Central Europe.

<p>Emphasis on Removing Obstacles to Economic Development, East Asia Policy Includes Engagement with Britain and the United States, The US Government Expresses Goodwill Towards Arita</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In a statement after assuming office, Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita strongly emphasized the two points of defending against the Red ideology and breaking away from the current state of economic foundation. According to the new Foreign Minister, during the past month, he was stationed in China as ambassador, exchanged opinions with the Chinese leadership, and on the way back home, he detoured through North China, entered "Manchukuo," and repeatedly consulted with Japanese government-appointed organizations. As a result, he is well aware that in implementing the China policy and maintaining close relations between Japan and Manchukuo, the urgent task should be to remove obstacles hindering Japan's trade and economic development through diplomatic efforts, so that Japan's economic diplomacy can have a bright future. To implement this policy, it is necessary to do so with decisive determination. Therefore, in the China policy, there is no need to adhere to the so-called three principles, and national relations should be gradually adjusted using methods appropriate to the situation. Anti-communism between China and Japan is a priority. In the policy towards Russia, the first priority should be to resolve pending issues and strive for the concretion of the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchukuo. As for the East Asia policy, it should not only be a policy for handling the mutual relations of East Asian countries, but should also include the policies towards Britain and the United States. Under the slogan of unifying diplomacy, he intends to implement what he believes in. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington. There is goodwill here towards the newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Arita once served as the First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the United States and is very familiar with the relationship between the United States and the Pacific. Arita will probably continue Hirota's policy, trying to improve trade relations between Japan and the United States, and calmly deal with thorny issues between the two countries.

<p>Total Number Not Less Than 150,000, Divided into Two Units to Fight the Enemy in Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to reliable sources, the number of volunteer soldiers has recently increased several times compared to before. Their total number is no less than 150,000. The main base area is around the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the rest are scattered in Hunchun, Panshi, Zhuhe, Mishan, Hulin, Dongning, Ning'an, Muling, Zichuan, Tangyuan, and other places. The organization is divided into two units. One is called the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Allied Army, which is divided into six armies. Its strength is the most powerful, its equipment is completely modernized, and its warfare is based on guerrilla tactics that divide into smaller units. Moreover, it has densely deployed cell organizations in various rural villages, and its intelligence is extremely sensitive. Therefore, although the Japanese and Manchukuo armies have continuously "suppressed" them, they have not been able to harm them in the slightest. The names of the commanders of each army are as follows: Yang Jingyu, commander of the First Army; Wang Detai, commander of the Second Army; Zhao Shangzhi, commander of the Third Army; Li Yanlu, commander of the Fourth Army; Zhou Baozhong, commander of the Fifth Army; Xie Wendong, commander of the Sixth Army. The second is called the Northeastern Volunteer Army, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Wu Yicheng and Deputy Commander Kong Xiancheng. Its combat effectiveness is also very strong, but its equipment is slightly inferior to that of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. (Hualian Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Border Conflicts Constant, Puppet State Issues Protest to Foreign Countries, Commentary in the London Times <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Changchun) "Manchukuo" has issued another protest to Outer Mongolia, seriously warning that if the Outer Mongolian government does not immediately adopt effective measures to stop the provocative acts against "Manchukuo" on the border, then the relationship between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia will undergo extremely serious changes. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented today on the border conflicts between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, saying that such conflicts have occurred frequently recently and have become commonplace, and there is no reason to be alarmed. At most, they are just local contacts, followed by diplomatic protests between Changchun and Kulun, and excessively righteous roars from Moscow and Tokyo. Neither side wants war nor can they afford war. Meng Kester's guiding report stated that if the Kwantung Army insists on pursuing its policy of expanding its influence into Mongolia, then Soviet Russia will be forced to reject it. This is an important question today. Stalin recently stated that Soviet Russia will fight for the independence of Outer Mongolia. This statement has also put Stalin in a difficult position, because if he allows Japan to continue to invade Mongolia, then his words and actions will be inconsistent and he will lose face. Face is an important factor in the Far East. If Soviet Russia rejects its invasion, then the Japanese government will feel that for the sake of Japan's prestige, it must support the Kwantung Army. The answer to this question is of course that the Japanese government will definitely rise up to help them. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After arriving in Tokyo on the 3rd, Major General Isogai met with others, including Interior Minister Adachi and Ketsui Umetsu, and reported his arrival.</p>
<p>Major General Isogai arrived at Tokyo Station at 9:00 PM on the 3rd and immediately returned to his home in Setagaya. Major General Isogai told reporters that China's attitude towards Japan has not changed much from what he reported when he returned to the country in early February. He is now determined to assume the important position of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau and will carry out all tasks with a spirit of serving the country with his life, following the orders of his superiors. As for foreign relations, recently the border incidents have occurred frequently and are gradually becoming tense. To what extent these incidents will develop in the future cannot be predicted, but in order to decisively implement what the empire believes in and promote national prestige, we must have full awareness and preparation. This is not just a problem for the military, but a problem for the entire nation, and it is also a problem of strengthening national power. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from Kulun, the reports in Tokyo that Mongolian troops and Mongolian aircraft used poison gas bombs in the recent border conflicts are all malicious rumors. At the same time, it is speculated that the purpose of these false reports is to enable the Japanese and Manchukuo sides to use poison gas bombs in future attacks. In previous conflicts, they had already used all kinds of weapons except poison gas. (Tass, 2nd)</p>

<p>Telegram from Nanjing The Shen Bao Newspaper Office forwards to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association: Reading the newspaper, we learned that the daily rental for a rickshaw in Shanghai has reached 85 cents. Because of the 8-cent reduction in daily rent, the owners have taken back the vehicles, resulting in the unemployment of 20,000 rickshaw pullers. The number of family members suffering from cold and hunger must be several times that number. Such heavy rent, such ruthless methods, is no different from leading people to eat each other. Social order is so unfair, is it not the same as building a tall building on top of a volcanic lava flow? We hope you will uphold justice, help the weak and support the poor, and stand on the position of the same nation, and will not tolerate such inhumane phenomena. Luo Jialun, Jiang.</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Significance of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications Establishing Children's Savings <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Feipeng</p>
<p>In the world, with mankind, there are children. Today's adults were once children, and today's children are the adults of the future, the people who will bear the responsibilities of the nation and society. Therefore, the cause of a nation's prosperity or decline can be said to be entirely built upon its children. There is an ancient saying: "Ten years to grow a tree, a hundred years to cultivate a person." Trees can be expected to have lush branches and leaves only after ten years of cultivation, while a person requires a hundred years. Cultivating a person requires a hundred years of effort. Is this not entirely dependent on generation after generation of children?</p>
<p>Today, in the 20th century, humans are fighting for their national survival with all their might, because the survival of the fittest has become a universal law of evolution. Without a strong nation, there is no hope for its kind. Many nations in the world have fought bloody battles for years to seek their liberation or to open up their territories, all for the sake of their descendants and to seek survival for their national seed.</p>
<p>When a nation is in a state of utter weakness, the only hope is to revive or restore it with trepidation. There are many ways to recover. In the past, King Goujian of Yue was almost destroyed by King Fucha of Wu. Fortunately, King Yue came up with various methods to wash away his shame. The first method was ten years of "breeding" and ten years of "teaching." "Breeding" means making efforts in terms of "quantity," and "teaching" means putting effort into "quality."</p>
<p>According to general surveys, there are about 100 million children in the country, which is a considerable number compared to other countries. From the perspective of "quantity," we can look upon one side of the world with heroic spirit, but from the perspective of "quality," we cannot help but retreat three houses compared to European and American countries!</p>
<p>When it comes to methods of cultivating children, various countries have many plans and programs. The Soviet Union has promulgated a small five-year plan for children, and various countries around the world have also designated dates as Children's Day. Everyone is celebrating and having fun. China naturally feels the need as well, and the need seems even more serious and urgent.</p>
<p>The work of Children's Year can be divided into three aspects: first, children's health, with the goal of enriching "quantity"; second, children's education, with the goal of enriching "quality"; and third, children's protection and relief, with the goal of taking both "quantity and quality" into consideration, with special attention to protecting children who encounter misfortune. Among the measures implemented during Children's Year, it was also stipulated that "children's thrift and savings associations" should be organized. Now we want to briefly explain this intention.</p>
<p>Regarding the tools of our human survival, Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s teachings once mentioned the four major elements of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. In ancient times, human life was simple, and these four elements did not seem so important. However, as times change and civilization evolves, these four items have become indispensable. What are the necessary conditions to maintain these four elements? It goes without saying that they are the three elements mentioned in economics: first, land; second, labor; and third, capital. Simply put, money is the exchange representative of capital.</p>
<p>For a primary or middle school student who does not have the ability to produce, the relationship with money is not very significant, because most of their lives are entrusted to their father or brother. Therefore, they do not know where the money comes from, whether it comes from hard work or bloodshed. They spend it as soon as they get it. Although we cannot say they squander it like dirt, at least they do not know how to practice thrift to seek future happiness.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of the future happiness of more than 100 million children across the country, our Ministry of Communications has specially established a "Children's Savings" scheme within the Postal Savings Bureau. The fund is very solid, the interest rate is particularly favorable, and the procedures are kept as simple as possible, so that every child can enjoy this benefit. Even the smallest children can ask their school teachers to handle it on their behalf. A few cents or a few dimes can be saved at any time. For example, if you can save three copper coins a day on candy and snacks, you can save 30 cents a month, and you can save more than three yuan a year. Plus the congratulatory gifts from your parents or relatives and the interest from the post office, wouldn't you have a large sum of money after a few years of graduation?</p>
<p>People in society often have a slogan, which is: "Money is omnipotent." If you want to realize your hopes or achieve your career, without money, it cannot be effective. The only hope for children is to have the opportunity to study, from elementary school to middle school to university. If you are in a family that can afford to go to school, you may not feel any difficulties, but in our country, there are probably several times more children from lower-middle-class societies who drop out of school and cannot afford to go to school! (According to surveys, there are approximately 100 million children nationwide, but only 12 million are in school.) If every child can understand the principle of saving, starting from elementary school, their parents or elders can give them a necessary hint of saving, or constantly encourage their interest in saving, wouldn't it be possible to solve their admission, further education, or adult career problems?</p>
<p>The fact that crimes in society are generally committed for money is a very common phenomenon. However, if we carefully examine the reasons for a person's poverty, half of it is due to the inability to endure hardship, and half of it is due to the unwillingness to be thrifty. On the other hand, it is also because their desires are too high. In order to satisfy their desires, they develop all kinds of bad habits such as extravagance and dissipation. If children can cultivate the virtue of thrift and usually know the principle of saving, they can cope with money easily when they need it, and they will not feel the famine of poverty! This is a motive for the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications to establish children's savings.</p>
<p>This year is Children's Year. Our Ministry of Communications has no other way to celebrate with you. We only hope that all children and the parents, siblings, and school teachers of the children will urge you to develop saving habits from today's Children's Day onwards and realize your great plans. We cheer:</p>
<p>Long live the children's savings system!</p>
<p>Long live Children's Year!</p>
<p>Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<h3 id="e85">Key Suspects in the Wang Jingwei Case, Yu Likui, Etc., Officially Questioned by Hong Kong Government; Prosecuting Lawyer States the Case; Nanjing Requests Extradition <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong correspondence, Yu Likui (also known as Li Zi'an, also known as Li Shiru), Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, four persons, were previously arrested by the Hong Kong government. On November 1 of last year, Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, was assassinated. Yu and others are suspected of being accomplices. The Nanjing government learned of this and sent a letter to Hong Kong requesting their extradition for trial. The defendants pleaded not guilty and hired lawyer Xian Bingxi to represent them. The Hong Kong government hired lawyer Shi Duzhili to appear in court as the prosecutor. The case has been questioned several times. On the afternoon of March 30, at 2:30 p.m., Magistrate Shi Gaofei Lu again brought the case to court. After the court opened, lawyer Shi Duzhili said that this case had been delayed for a long time and should now be tried. There are four defendants in this case, and they should be tried together. Lawyer Xian Bingxi agreed. Then lawyer Shi Duzhili stated the case, roughly saying, "The government accuses the defendants of intending to commit the crime of assassinating important Chinese figures Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei. Although this action was initiated by other political figures, as far as this case is concerned, the four defendants should bear the blame. In other words, they are bound to a certain existing organization that intends to brew riots. In 1934, the first defendant</p>
<p>Yu Likui met a man named Wang Yaqiao in Shanghai. This person was a key figure in the organization and had planned several incidents, some successful and some unsuccessful, and had killed several people. In 1934, they fled to Hong Kong. At the same time, other people joined the organization. The joiners did not know what they did. However, they were very friendly with Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui. In previous interrogations, a witness testified that the defendants had traveled to many places in 1934 and 1935, but he did not know what they were doing. At the beginning of 1934, a large reward was offered for the assassination of Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei. Very few people knew about this, only two or three people. The former defendant Yu Likui was one of them. As for the source of the reward, they kept it secret. Apart from two or three people, no one in the bureau could find out. Between June and July 1934, a man named Hua Kezhi came to Hong Kong from Nanjing to discuss the establishment of a news agency in Nanjing. The first defendant Yu Likui also attended. Later, the news agency was named Chenguang. The purpose of establishing this agency was nothing more than to use the privileges of journalists and photographers to get close to various important people in order to take action. By September 1934, the Chenguang News Agency was established. The president was Hua Kezhi, and the editor was He Boguang, who is now detained in Nanjing. Others include Zhang Yuhua and Liu Shurong. As for Sun Fengming, he was registered as a journalist. After the registration procedures of the agency were completed, everyone proceeded to design the murder of Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei and planned to act on November 1. The Kuomintang Congress was held on that day, and all the important figures attending had to gather for a photo. At this time, all the guards had to leave their posts, and the photographers could approach the important figures because they had passes, so they could approach the important figures at will for the convenience of their work without being obstructed. Therefore, the murderer could take this opportunity to draw his gun and aim. Before the establishment of the Chenguang News Agency, they had discussed who to send to carry out the assassination. Later, Hua Kezhi proposed, and Sun Fengming was selected. During the discussion in Hong Kong, they also decided that if Sun Fengming did not have enough courage, the third defendant would be replaced.</p>
<p>Hu Dahai goes there, and Hu often volunteers for this. On November 1, 1934, the Kuomintang Congress was held, and Sun Fengming went as ordered. He had the opportunity to carry out the assassination, but the meeting was changed temporarily. Although Sun met Jiang Jieshi, he was a little timid because it did not match the scheduled time to act, and he returned disappointed. Hong Kong was very dissatisfied when they learned of this. They did not trust Sun Fengming very much. At the same time, they planned to send the third defendant Hu Dahai instead. After several discussions, it was decided to give Sun Fengming another opportunity. However, in order to encourage his actions, he was specially summoned to Hong Kong to listen to the instructions of the person in charge and to ask him whether he was willing to continue working. At that time, Sun Fengming came to Hong Kong with Zhang Yuhua and stated at the meeting that he was willing to continue serving. The person in charge then decided to act again on November 1, 1935. At that time, Hua Kezhi came to Hong Kong to report on the progress in Nanjing and asked for money. The second defendant</p>
<p>Zhou Shiping has also been to Shanghai and Nanjing to inspect the news agency and study whether Sun Fengming has made up his mind. At 8:30 a.m. on November 1, Sun Fengming went to the Kuomintang headquarters to wait until the central committee members took a photo. Sun fired three shots at Wang Jingwei, but he was eventually knocked down by the guards and injured by gunfire. Both were sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. The next day, Sun died of his injuries. Before he died, he made a confession, pointing out many accomplices. After Sun's death, the police found a photo and a reporter's pass on him, and immediately went to the Chenguang News Agency to search the premises. When they arrived at the agency, everyone in the agency had fled, and the documents were burned. A large pile of paper ashes was left, but the police still picked up a piece of scrap paper, on which were written the names of Wang Jingwei and a low-level staff member. The staff member was a registrar for the Chenguang News Agency, but this matter had nothing to do with him. After the unsuccessful assassination of Wang, Hua Kezhi came to Hong Kong to report the whole story in detail and raise money to help those who were arrested and imprisoned. At that time, several people in Hong Kong, along with Sun Fengming's wife, brought a large sum of money from Hong Kong to provide relief, and the first defendant, Yu Likui, was the main person in charge. The second defendant Zhou Shiping provided material assistance. As for the third defendant Hu Dahai, he worked very hard to run around and devoted himself the most. The police found a large number of documents at his place, proving his actions. The fourth defendant</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan is Wang Yaqiao's most trusted secretary and once went to Nanjing to investigate the financial expenditures. A lot of documents were found on the third defendant, including Wang Yaqiao's handwriting. There was also a letter of repentance in the documents, saying that he was very ashamed of this failure and that he would surely be able to get what he wanted in the future. The content talked about taking pictures and had words such as "shocking the world." After the statement, Qu Di, the secretary of the Government Secretariat, testified that he had received the official document from Nanjing. The official ordered that the case be adjourned for further trial.</p>

<p>Earlier Departure from the Chenguang Society: Asked when did you leave the Chenguang Society? Answer: October 30th. Asked why was it necessary to leave? Answer: Originally, Li Huaicheng asked me to go to Shanghai together, but because the exit permit was not obtained, I didn't go. Now that I have explained it clearly, I left. Asked what did you talk about on the evening of October 28th? Answer: That was after dinner, casual conversation after drinking. We talked a lot. Sun Fengming talked about patriotism, and Hua Kezhi expressed his support. Li Huaicheng asked me to go to Shanghai. Asked, weren't you discussing international issues and national affairs? Answer: I don't remember. Asked, they have all confessed, and Li Huaicheng just confessed too. How can you deny and say you don't remember? Answer: I don't remember now. Asked, didn't you encourage Sun Fengming? Answer: I didn't encourage him. I didn't tell him to go kill someone. Asked, so you knew he was going to assassinate someone? Answer: He didn't say for sure who he would assassinate. Asked, didn't they talk about assassinating President Wang? At this point, the presiding judge summoned the accused Li. Li said, "These were just exaggerations by young people." The presiding judge refuted him, saying, "Even if they were exaggerations, you can't deny that you didn't know." Answer: I was drunk and confused at the time. They said they wanted to warn someone, but I didn't know who they wanted to warn. Asked, according to you, you have nothing to do with this case. Why did you move two or three times after arriving in Shanghai? Answer: For convenience. Asked, where did you live after arriving in Shanghai? Tell me. Answer: I originally wanted to live at Li Huaicheng's house, but because there was no bed, I first stayed at the Andong Hotel. The next day, because I was visiting Mingyou, I moved to the Chunjiang Hotel, and later moved to a hotel on Carter Road. Asked, didn't you meet Hua Kezhi after the incident? Answer: Yes. He said that he originally wanted to kill Chairman Chiang, but he didn't know how he killed President Wang. I even said that they shouldn't have done that. Asked, according to you, you knew that Hua Kezhi instigated the assassination. He is a good friend of yours, and you lived together for two or three months. How could he not have told you beforehand? Answer: He didn't express any intention. I was always on guard against being used by them.</p>
<p>Received Twenty Yuan Afterwards: Asked, he gave you twenty yuan and told you to leave, is that right? Answer: Yes. Asked, what day did you leave Nanjing? Answer: The 31st. Asked, did you know about escorting Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters? Answer: I didn't know. Asked, you all left Nanjing after the meeting on the 28th. As soon as you left, the incident happened, and it happened three times in total. The process was very complicated, and there was a background. You lived in the society, ate in the society, and left secretly. Today, you just deny everything and want to overturn the case. Don't say that the court can't believe you, I'm afraid you yourself can't believe it. Answer: There are many coincidences in the world. Asked, can't happen again and again and again. Answer: I don't know anything. Asked, obtaining the exit permit was the means of assassination. You obtained it for them, how can you deny knowing? Answer: I really didn't know. I introduced He Poguang to obtain it.</p>
<p>Refuted and Left Speechless: Asked, why did you always live in the Chenguang Society? Answer: Because my life was drifting, I had no possessions, and I lived one day at a time to save some money. The presiding judge refuted him, saying, "So anyone can live in the Chenguang Society?" The accused Xiang was speechless. Asked, have you been to Fujian? Answer: I went with Li Huaicheng because a girlfriend who was not my wife was teaching there. We wanted to seek a living with Mo Ziang. Asked, have you worked in the People's Government? Answer: No. Asked, how long did you stay in Fujian? Answer: Two or three weeks. Asked, have you been there before? Answer: I have been to Xiamen before. Asked, do you know anyone in the People's Government? Answer: I don't know anyone. Li Huaicheng, Hua Kezhi, and I all went there to seek a living. Asked, do you remember what was said at the meeting on the evening of the 28th? Answer: I was drunk and confused at the time and didn't pay attention. Asked, who is Sun Fengming's person? Answer: I don't know him. I only know that he is Wang Yaqiao's person. I don't know if he came with Hua Kezhi. Asked, do you know about the gun test? Answer: I don't know. Asked, you arrived in Shanghai on the 31st, why did you leave the Chenguang Society on the 30th? Answer: Because Li Huaicheng lived in Bafutang, I lived closer to the Mengyuan Hotel. When I left, I told them that if Li came, I would say that I lived in the Mengyuan Hotel. Asked, why did you have to go to such lengths? Clearly, you knew that something was going to happen, so you moved out. Don't try to deny everything completely. Answer: I really didn't know. At this point, the presiding judge warned the accused Xiang, saying that the content of the case was very clear. It would be understandable if you denied the minor points, but don't deny everything completely. The accused Xiang still insisted that he knew nothing. Asked, have you committed a crime before? Answer: No. Asked, didn't you commit a kidnapping case in Shanghai before and were sentenced to three years in prison? Answer: No such thing. Please have the court investigate. At this point, the presiding judge announced that the interrogation was over. The time was 3:55 PM.</p>
<p>The Accused Lu, a Former Lawyer, More Cunning in His Denials:</p>
<p>The presiding judge summoned Lu Qingqi. The accused Lu was a former lawyer, so he was more familiar with the law than the other accused. His denials were also more cunning than those of the other accused. Asked, who introduced you to the Chenguang Society? Answer: I didn't join the Chenguang Society. Asked, do you know the other defendants? Answer: Yes, I know them. Asked, do you know when the Chenguang Society was organized? Answer: I don't know. Asked, when did you go to the Chenguang Society? Answer: March of the 24th year. Asked, do you know the purpose of their running the Chenguang Society? Answer: I don't know. I only knew it was an assassination organization after reading the indictment. I didn't even know when I was arrested. Asked, do you know Sun Fengming? Answer: I don't know him. I have never seen him before. Asked, why did they leave the gun at your house? Answer: In early August of last year, Guo Zhijia came to my house and brought a leather suitcase that was more than two feet tall and one foot wide, saying that Zhang Yuhua asked him to bring it to my house.</p>
<p>Left Suitcase, Unaware of Gun: Asked, where did he put the suitcase? Answer: On the table. I didn't pay attention. Asked, what happened next? Answer: I took it to the room and put it under the bed. The suitcase wasn't heavy. Because it was locked, I didn't know what was inside. Asked, when did you find out that there was a gun inside? Answer: Sometime during that week, He Poguang came and opened the suitcase. I also saw the gun. At that time, I showed displeasure on my face. Asked, why did he put it here? He didn't say anything. The next day, Guo Zhifeng came and took it away. Asked, is this the gun? Answer: It seemed to be a little longer. Asked, hiding a gun is a crime even if you don't assassinate anyone. Why did you let them leave it for a week? Answer: This case is a very important event. Although I saw the gun, I didn't know that they were going to assassinate President Wang. I don't know why they wanted to put it in my house. I couldn't scold them too harshly. Asked, they have tried to assassinate three times. Each time, they used a "rental notice" to indicate whether they had acted. If they hadn't acted, they would post the "rental notice" in a certain place, and then one person would send a telegram to notify them. You sent the second telegram, didn't you? Answer: There is no such thing at all. Asked, Zhang Yuhua confessed this. Answer: There is no such thing. The presiding judge then read Zhang's confession. Lu continued to deny it cunningly.</p>
<p>Denied Sending Telegram Notification: Asked, you said in the investigation court that you can go to the telegraph office to check the telegram. Is it your signature? If it can be found, it will naturally be beneficial to you. But which telegraph office did you send the telegram from, what day did you send it, and who did you send it to? You have to tell the court so that we can check it. Answer: I don't know anything. How can I tell you? The presiding judge then questioned Zhang Yuhua on various points. The accused Zhang generally evaded by saying he was not clear. Asked, how much money have you used from the Chenguang Society? Answer: I haven't used any. Asked, didn't Zhang Yuhua give you fifty yuan? Answer: No such thing. Asked, you confessed yourself that they gave me fifty yuan, I didn't want it, but they insisted on giving it to me. How can you deny it? Answer: No such thing. The presiding judge then presented Lu's written record from the investigation court. The accused Lu then began to answer, saying, "Zhang Yuhua came to Zhenjiang on December 27th and asked me to tour Jinshan and Jiaoshan. Because I had dampness in my feet and couldn't walk, he gave me the money. I received it at my home in Zhenjiang." Asked, did he tell you to take this money and run away? Answer: No. Asked, maybe he wanted you to leave was out of good intentions. Answer: But that wasn't the case at the time. Asked, you confessed at the Gendarmerie Headquarters that "they had a relationship with Chen Gengshu and Li Jizhu. The funds were taken by Hua Kezhi from Wang Yaqiao and then from Chen and Li. They wanted to attack central figures. I thought it wouldn't happen, so I didn't report it." Is that right? Answer: This record is unreliable. Asked, you confessed this in the Capital District Court and the investigation court of this court. Do you remember? Answer: I only said that I usually heard them say that there was someone named Sun and someone named Shen who wanted to harm military leaders, but I didn't know the plan. I have never even seen Sun Fengming. Asked, so you only hid the gun? Answer: I didn't know anything at the time, and I have been reciting Buddhist scriptures for twenty years, abstaining from killing and saving lives.</p>
<p>Investigate Evidence and Adjourn for Retrial: At this point, the presiding judge said, "This case cannot be concluded today. If the defense lawyers have any opinions on reviewing the case files, they can state them." The lawyers then stated their opinions separately. The presiding judge then ordered the clerk to read the confessions of the three accused, Li, Xiang, and Lu, all of which were signed. The presiding judge then formally announced that the debate could not be concluded today because further investigation of evidence and review of case files were required. The retrial will be held on a later date. Once the date is set, summons will be sent. The defendants will remain in custody. Court adjourned. The time was 5:50 PM. (End)</p>

<p>The county has been doing well in suppressing opium, but recently, the family members of opium offenders Fu Runxiang and Xu Kaiyuan, who were sentenced for failing to appear after being summoned, Fu Wangshi and Xu Gaoshi, accused Pi Yun Town Chief Ding Shilong of extorting thirty yuan under the pretext of the case in a provincial complaint. The county has ordered an investigation. On the 2nd, the county ordered the police to summon the case for investigation. The two sides gave different versions of the story. The magistrate ordered that Town Chief Ding Shilong be detained and the plaintiffs, Fu Wangshi, etc., be ordered to return. On the 3rd, another hearing was ordered. According to Ding Shilong, Fu Runxiang was a person who failed to appear after being summoned. He was ordered to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau and then to the County Government to be sentenced to six months in prison. Later, he suddenly applied for registration for self-renewal, which was exempted from criminal punishment. Therefore, he bore a grudge and was falsely accused. Moreover, when submitting the list of informants, he was inadvertently seen by others and spread abroad. Therefore, they formed a united front and conspired to frame him. The plaintiff's statements about the source of the bribe money of thirty yuan were inconsistent. The official ordered the plaintiff to post bail for investigation, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The telephones of the County Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations in the county have been reclassified, resulting in an additional monthly fee of one yuan.

Recently, Chairman Cheng of the Chamber of Commerce repeatedly negotiated with the Bureau's personnel, but the Bureau stated that the regulations had already been changed and it was difficult to reverse. Therefore, the Bureau sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce asking it to forward to the various associations (i.e., those with telephones) to collect the outstanding balance of the previous payments. The Chamber of Commerce then convened a meeting of representatives of the relevant associations (i.e., those with telephones) on the afternoon of the 2nd. As a result, it was resolved to continue to strive for a reduction.</p>

<p>Issued Written Statement Stating the Mission of the Trip, Scheduled to Return to Shanghai and Visit Beijing on the 4th of Next Month</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of the Philippines, it has been striving to develop various undertakings of the new country. A delegation of members of Congress has been specially sent to organize a study tour to visit China and Japan. Another news study tour, which was invited by the Japanese authorities, traveled with the delegation. It passed through Shanghai on the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru yesterday afternoon and left for Japan on the same ship last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Delegates</p>
<p>The study tour organized by the Philippine government consists of three members of Congress. The list is as follows: Guillermo Villanueva (head of the delegation), Pedro Vera, Manuel A. Alzate, and their families. After the Chichibu Maru arrived in Shanghai, the delegates were accompanied by Mr. Wang, the manager of the China Prosperity Bank in this city, to disembark and tour. That evening, they boarded the original ship and set sail at 12:00 AM. They are scheduled to return to China on the 4th of next month for a week-long tour. The itinerary is as follows: On the 5th, they will go to Beijing. On the 7th, they will return to Shanghai. On the 8th, they will go to Hangzhou. On the 10th, they will leave Shanghai for Hong Kong. The delegation also carries many letters, which they will personally present to our government authorities when they come to China next time.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>When the delegation arrived in Shanghai, it issued a written statement as follows: This delegation was organized by colleagues elected by the Congress by order of the government. The purpose is to study whether the markets of China, Japan, and the Far East and Europe are suitable for the sale of our country's products, so as to improve commerce and industry. The delegation also represents the people of our country to extend sincere congratulations to your country. The Chinese living on the Philippine Islands are very friendly to the people of our country. China and the Philippines began trading one hundred years ago. We hope that the relationship between the two countries will become closer in the future.</p>
<p>Establishment of Consulate Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>According to the delegation, in addition to studying commerce, they will also visit other undertakings. As for the establishment of a Philippine consulate in China, it must be approved by the Congress in Washington and has not yet been determined. As for organizing a trading company, it will be decided after we have completed our study and reported to the government.</p>
<p>Press Also Came</p>
<p>Another news study tour came with the delegation, consisting of eight members. The list is as follows: P. Calica (head of the delegation), G. Castillo (the above two are members of the country's propaganda department), F. mongahos., F. B. Icasiono (the above two are from the Forum News), S. Lopez. (Guide News), J. Collos (Freedom News), F. Leano (Financier), M. Concepci6n (poet), etc.</p>
<p>New National Atmosphere</p>
<p>According to Icasiono of the delegation, he told the Central News Agency reporter that the delegation was invited by the Japanese press. The itinerary is the same as that of the members of Congress. Since the establishment of the independent government of the Philippines, President Quezon has been working hard on construction, sparing no effort. Various administrative facilities are also making progress. Recently, it was also stipulated that people over the age of 20 will generally receive military training, which began on April 1. Now the Philippine government is autonomous in everything except foreign affairs. Icasiono continued, the Philippine press is still relatively developed. There are 12 daily newspapers, written in English, Spanish, and Italian. There are 40 weekly publications. There are also 4 Chinese-language newspapers founded by Chinese. The Forum News, to which I belong, has a daily circulation of 35,000 copies. This trip will be about a month later, and I will come to China again for investigation.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou Discusses the Purpose of Sponsoring the Association</p>
<p>People from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, are actively preparing for the Shanghai International Exposition to revive the city's declining economy. Preparations are underway separately, and the construction of the exhibition site has already begun and is expected to be completed by the end of May, with the opening on July 1st. Many Chinese and foreign manufacturers have been contacting them to participate in the exhibition, and exhibits from various places have been shipped to Shanghai one after another. The China National Products Sales Cooperative Association held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved to notify all member factories nationwide to participate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolution to Participate</p>
<p>The China National Products Sales Cooperative Association held a regular meeting at the Zhengyi Society of the Continental Department Store yesterday at noon. Over fifty directors attended, including Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Yixian, Wang Zhixin, Fang Jiange, Wu Qingtai, Pan Yangyao, Sun Ruihuang, and Wang Zhengfang. The meeting was chaired by Wang Zhixin. In addition to discussing association affairs, the chairman proposed the issue of the association's members participating in the Shanghai International Exposition. After discussion, it was resolved that the association, organized by legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants, with a pure purpose, should notify all member factories to participate in order to promote national products.</p>
<p>Letters to Members</p>
<p>In accordance with the resolution, the association sent letters to all member factories yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that Mr. Dulu, a foreigner residing in Shanghai, and Mr. Tang Shuping, a Chinese merchant, plan to hold the Shanghai International Exposition from July to the end of August this year on Yangshupu Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai. The scale is grand and unprecedented. We have heard that many products from Britain and the United States have been added, and it is expected that the number of visitors will be considerable. Recently, representatives from the expo contacted the association and warmly welcomed Chinese manufacturers to join the exhibition. At the last regular meeting, it was resolved to send a letter to all member factories to solicit participation. The association stipulates that each unit occupies 196 square feet (14 feet long and 14 feet wide), with an exhibition hall 9 feet high. The rental fee for each unit for two months is 430 national currency yuan, and 530 yuan for corner locations (including water, electricity, and room fees). If more than four units are rented, the association can provide design and construction services free of charge. If members can rent several units together, they may be able to request a discount on the rental fee. If your factory agrees to participate, please inform the association of the number of units you intend to rent as soon as possible so that we can gather the information and contact the expo on your behalf. This is to notify all member factories. China National Products Sales Cooperative Association."</p>
<p>Lin's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Bankers' Association, stated that the Shanghai International Exposition held in Shanghai is sufficient to save the city's economic decline. In addition to expressing his sympathy, he also listed his name in support. According to Mr. Lin, the earliest supporter of the association was Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau. He conducted a detailed investigation of the purpose and economic status of the expo's organizers. According to Mr. Guo, the earliest organizer, Dulu, came to Shanghai to select a vacant lot at the old site of the Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road as the expo site. His purpose was to promote products and expand trade. Mr. Guo believes that its purpose is pure, and that such an exhibition is indeed beneficial during this period of industrial and commercial depression. After investigating its economic status, it is also very reliable. For national product factories with group guarantees, rent is not collected in advance, and the method is also very appropriate. In addition to personally listing his name in support, Mr. Guo also sent a letter inviting him to list his name in support. After receiving Mr. Guo's invitation, he also conducted an investigation and learned that the organizers of the association are Tang Shuping and Dulu. Mr. Tang is a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, and the purpose he proposed is supported by the industrial and commercial sectors. The association only collects the rental fee from participants at the opening, and national product factories are protected. The method is quite appropriate, so he also agreed to support it. He believes that any exhibition, if the economic source does not rely on rent, the planning is proper, and the management is appropriate, will be of great benefit to the sale of national products.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Bank Clearing House Expands Operations and Increases Total Amount <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance Bills, etc., Have Begun to Circulate in the Market</p>
<p>The Bank Clearing House, affiliated with the Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Reserve Committee, was established on January 10th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. After a successful trial operation, it gradually expanded. In addition to the member banks of the Bankers' Association, the China-One Trust Company and the Four Banks Savings Society are also members of the clearing house. Since reaching an agreement with the Money Trade Joint Reserve to collect money shop bills and after the Central Bank joined, the clearing volume has increased. For example, yesterday's total amount was 31,340,339.09 yuan, the clearing amount was 10,211,190.02 yuan, the transfer amount was 18,821,305.07 yuan, the amount for money shops was 1,738,488.14 yuan, and the amount for others was 1,177,611.49 yuan.

In accordance with the convention, the exchange will sign and accept the bills. These bank acceptance bills have already circulated in the market. All sectors are happy to accept them due to their well-known credit. At the same time, the exchange handles discounting. Yesterday, the discount rate for 90-day bank acceptance bills was 1.2 cents per thousand yuan per day. Re-discounting is handled by the Central, China, and Communications banks. It is heard that the exchange will gradually expand its operations after a successful trial run, with the aim of rescuing the market and increasing credit chips.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Qiu Yujin Discusses the Dutch Currency Devaluation: A Good Opportunity to Promote National Products in Nanyang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Hopes to Establish Promotional Organizations as Soon as Possible; Also Hopes the Government Will Open Shipping and Banking Services</p>
<p>Qiu Yujin, a Chinese merchant from Nanbang Port, Su Island, Dutch East Indies, has returned to China to investigate the actual situation of domestic products in order to develop the sales of national products in Nanyang. Mr. Qiu entered Beijing via Guangdong and Fujian last week, met with Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, and made all the necessary arrangements. He arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd and is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel. He will visit the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association to make arrangements, and plans to return to Nanyang next week.</p>
<p>Excellent Opportunity to Promote National Products</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed Mr. Qiu at his residence. According to him, the Chinese in various ports of the Dutch East Indies have gradually understood the situation in their motherland since last year through publicity by the government and overseas Chinese merchants such as Hu Wenhu, and the import of domestic products has also gradually increased. Chinese who used to run Japanese goods have switched to running national products, so the sales of national products are gradually developing. There is a great demand for domestic canned foods, cement umbrellas, flour, ironware, and other items. Since the devaluation of the Dutch currency, with each Dutch guilder worth two national currency yuan, it is an even better opportunity to import national products. Therefore, it is hoped that domestic industries will make efforts to promote sales in Nanyang as soon as possible in order to obtain overseas markets.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Are Now Seeking Rapid Development</p>
<p>In the past, Japanese goods were promoted in Nanyang by relying on the sales of Chinese commercial shops and did not establish their own shops. Only wholesale firms were operated. Since the Chinese switched to operating national products, the Japanese, seeing the danger of market seizure, have successively established their own shops. The scale is not large, and it is still difficult to compete with Chinese shops. The overseas Chinese initially agreed not to purchase Japanese goods, but Japanese goods rely on domestic shipping and the economic adjustments of the banking sector, so the transportation is rapid and the cost is extremely low, which is unmatched by our overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Urgently Hoping to Realize Three Types of Undertakings</p>
<p>Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Nanyang now hope that the motherland's government and the banking and commercial sectors will realize three types of undertakings as soon as possible: opening shipping routes to Nanyang to directly transport national products to Nanyang and get rid of the constraints of foreign shipping; establishing large-scale banks to adjust overseas Chinese finance; and establishing national product promotion organizations so that overseas Chinese merchants do not have to travel long distances to return to China to purchase goods.</p>
<p>Living Conditions of Overseas Chinese in Su Island</p>
<p>Su Island is under the jurisdiction of Dutch Java. It is an important and commercially prosperous location. The annual output of native products such as pepper, coffee, and coconut dried goods is very large. There are more than 310,000 overseas Chinese on the island, 40% of whom are engaged in commerce, and the rest are working. Life is relatively stable, but in society, due to the national strength, although there are so many overseas Chinese, they are not as powerful as the small number of overseas Chinese from other countries. Therefore, when incidents occur, the local government is inevitably somewhat biased. The Dutch government still charges each overseas Chinese an entry tax of 150 guilders, equivalent to 300 national currency yuan, and a uniform import tax of 30%.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Resolution of Rickshaw Dispute: Vehicle Operators Resume Business This Morning; Shanghai Municipal Council Vehicle Committee Reaches Agreement with Vehicle Owners Yesterday; April Licenses Available for Collection from 6th Onward; Mutual Aid Society Fees Payable by the End of This Month <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhong Si, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Massey, Chairman of the Vehicle Committee, and Mr. Yin Zhiling, representative of the vehicle operators, held discussions at the Shanghai Municipal Council Vehicle Committee at 11:00 AM yesterday. As a result of the discussions, the vehicle operators agreed to resume rickshaw services from this morning, operating as usual. April licenses can be collected from the 6th of this month. The mutual aid society fees can be paid by the end of this month, without the need to prepay them at the same time as license collection. The above conditions were all signed and agreed to by Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, and Hou Shao'an, representatives of the Vehicle Operators Association, to be followed accordingly.</p>
<p>Temporary Meeting</p>
<p>After Representative Yin reported back to the association, the vehicle owners considered the negotiations satisfactory. Subsequently, an emergency meeting was held at 4:00 PM, resolving that: Negotiations were successful, and business will resume on the morning of the 4th; All unlawful rickshaw pullers who dragged away vehicles and handed them over to the police will have their vehicles retrieved by the respective vehicle owners upon presentation of their licenses; The police are requested to investigate missing vehicles; Rickshaws on the streets that are incomplete or damaged should be detained by the police at any time, and the owners notified to retrieve them to avoid losses; Statistics on the number of losses should be compiled; and April licenses should be collected and business resumed immediately.</p>
<p>Losses on Both Sides</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Rickshaw Pullers Association, speaking to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, the business suspension of three days resulted in a loss of 21,600 yuan in vehicle rental fees. Losses due to damaged vehicles and missing items amounted to over 26,000 yuan, totaling approximately 50,000 yuan. According to Chen Guoliang, the representative of the rickshaw pullers, the loss for the rickshaw pullers during the three days, with two pullers per vehicle per day, at one yuan per person, totaled 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Southern District Announcement</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department summoned more than ten representatives from rickshaw businesses and rickshaw pullers in the French Concession's special district at 9:00 AM yesterday, holding a joint meeting in the police station. As a result of the discussions, to avoid escalation, it was decided to first allow the vehicle operators to resume business and release vehicles as usual. As for the issue of opposing rent reduction, vehicle operators can negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council again after resuming business. After the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM, the French police immediately posted an announcement regarding the resumption of business by vehicle operators at the entrance of the Southern District branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society, stating: "Announcement: The public rickshaw operators in the French Concession have decided to resume business today. All rickshaw pullers can directly rent vehicles from the original vehicle owners or contractors as usual, to make a living. Please be informed accordingly."</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Business</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Operators Association announced yesterday: "Upon investigation, the Rickshaw Committee decided to implement new regulations from April 1st, forcibly collecting mutual aid fees and restricting the registration of rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers, based on their own interests, declared a cessation of mutual aid fee payments. The vehicle operators believe that the rent reduction issue is relatively minor, while the issues of restricting rickshaw puller registration and forcibly collecting mutual aid fees not only greatly affect the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers but are also deficient in legal principles. It is difficult for us to act. Therefore, we were forced to temporarily suspend business from April 1st, awaiting a resolution. However, this suspension of business was purely a peaceful negotiation, especially with the concern for maintaining the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods in mind. After the suspension of business, we repeatedly tried our best to maintain the issue of relieving the rickshaw pullers' living conditions. Unexpectedly, a portion of rickshaw pullers, under the leadership of the Mutual Aid Society, engaged in excessive actions and disruptive events, which was truly unexpected and deeply regrettable. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities deeply feel that prolonging this suspension will impact social security and the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods, which are all concerning. They negotiated with the representatives of this association to find a solution, deciding to postpone the payment of this month's mutual aid fees, collect 2.09 yuan to receive April licenses, and continue to process the registration of rickshaw pullers. This association believes that this result has achieved the initial intention of the vehicle operators in suspending business to protect their livelihoods. For the sake of social prospects and the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods, we should first resume business. As for other issues, we will negotiate separately. In addition to separately advising all vehicle operators to unanimously resume business from today, this association deeply apologizes for all disruptions to social traffic and inconveniences to passengers during the suspension of business. As for the April licenses, this association has already paid for them. All vehicle owners who have paid the donation to the Shanghai Bank should bring their payment receipts from April 5th onwards, first to this association for verification and license collection. Fearing that this may not be fully known, this announcement is specially made."</p>
<p>Vehicle Operators' Statement</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Vehicle Operators Association made a statement to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter yesterday, stating: "The vehicle operators' suspension of business originated from opposing the Shanghai Municipal Council Vehicle Committee's implementation of new regulations from April 1st. The main points of these new regulations are threefold: Forcibly collecting mutual aid fees; Restricting the registration of rickshaw pullers, which is detrimental to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of unemployed rickshaw pullers; and Reducing rental fees without reducing the mutual aid fees. We believe that the rent reduction point is secondary. The vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers have a relationship as close as lips and teeth, which is extremely important. If accumulating business can sustain vehicle operators, we are happy to support rent reduction. However, the two [registration restriction and mandatory fees] are related to greatly limiting rickshaw puller registration, immediately causing tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers to be unemployed due to not being registered. The Mutual Aid Society has been established for twenty months, collecting 300,000 yuan from the rickshaw pullers' hard-earned money, but with little achievement. The rickshaw pullers, seeing this obligation without rights and no possibility of continued burden, declared to this association their refusal to pay and requested that all vehicle operators not prepay. This association believes that the payment of mutual aid fees by the vehicle operators is essentially a collection on behalf of payment and must be based on the principle of mutual agreement. Now that the payers have expressed their refusal, the vehicle operators cannot make the payment on their behalf. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council is ordering compulsory collection, placing the vehicle operators in a difficult position and wanting to avoid the risk of having their licenses revoked or fined a large sum by the council. They were forced to temporarily suspend business from April 1st, awaiting negotiations. After the mutual suspension of business, the vehicle operators repeatedly tried to maintain the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods. Unexpectedly, a portion of rickshaw pullers, under the leadership of the Mutual Aid Society, engaged in excessive actions and disruptive behavior, which is deeply regrettable. On the morning of the 3rd, at 11:00 AM, Mr. Zhong Si, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, felt that prolonged delays would have a major impact on social prospects and the livelihoods of the poor. He negotiated with Mr. Yin Zhiling, the representative of this association, to find a solution. After consulting with Mr. Massey, Chairman of the Vehicle Committee, it was decided that: Payment of the April mutual aid fees would be postponed, and licenses would be issued for 2.09 yuan, allowing for business operations; and the registration of rickshaw pullers would continue. This association believes that solving the two major problems of mutual aid fees and rickshaw puller registration fulfills the association's initial intention of protecting the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods, so we can express our agreement. We have already notified all vehicle operators to resume business immediately. However, during the suspension period, we are deeply grateful for the warm sympathy and assistance from party and government agencies, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, all Chinese directors, and people from all walks of life. This association deeply apologizes for all disruptions to social traffic and inconveniences to passengers during the suspension period."</p>
<p>Cancellation of Relief</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society issued a notice to its members: "Notice: According to the resolution of the board of directors of this association yesterday, since most members of this association currently have no rickshaws to pull, this association intends to provide each member with one jiao and five fen of silver dollars per day from April 4th to maintain their livelihood. This proposal has been approved by the custody committee, and all procedures have been prepared, awaiting implementation. However, we have now received news that the vehicle operators will resume renting vehicles as usual from April 4th. Therefore, we are specially notifying all members to resume rickshaw pulling work as usual. The above relief is no longer necessary, and this association is deeply fortunate that the members' livelihoods can return to normal and not be cut off, which is more perfect than the above relief provided by this association."</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society issued a correction letter, stating: "Sir, recently your newspaper has carried news related to our association, but some of the reports are untrue, and the truth is unclear. We hereby request that the following corrections be made: Our association is an organization for the welfare of public rickshaw pullers in the International Settlement. Its internal organization and work have long been known to all walks of life. Social undertakings are already difficult to manage, let alone the difficult situation and numerous obstacles faced by our association. However, we do not slack off in our work because of this. If it is said that all our work is only for the enjoyment of one or two hundred people, then any rickshaw puller can prove the enthusiastic participation in our five clinics, six bathhouses, six children's schools, mutual aid department, and other projects. People from all walks of life can also come and inspect in person to understand the truth. In addition, our work has statistics, and all receipts and expenditures have accounts, procedures are solemn, and the organization is strict. How can our association fabricate facts to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand? As for the current organizational charter, it was decided by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and how can our association intervene? A few people, without investigation, say that our association once instigated rickshaw pullers to forcibly drag vehicles, or that many rickshaw pullers came to the association to cause trouble. All of these are unfounded. Since the April 1st suspension of vehicle release, our association has sincerely comforted and persuaded the rickshaw pullers to seek a proper solution with peaceful means. At the same time, the board of directors of our association also convened a special emergency meeting and resolved yesterday (2nd) that from the 4th, all members of the association who have no rickshaws to pull will be given one jiao and five fen of silver dollars per day to temporarily maintain their livelihood. The locations are as follows: Upstairs of the Xiaocaichang Market on Dongjiaxing Road; Gordon Road Police Station; Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Yuezhou Road. Every other day, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, they will receive it once, that is, three jiao of silver dollars each time. It will be stopped when most vehicles have been released. In short, our association will do its best to assist as much as possible, and our association is also deeply concerned about social order and tranquility. This is addressed to the gentlemen of the Shen Bao Newspaper."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Explanation from the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the Difficulties of Issuing New Bonds, Telegram Sent to the Shanghai Banking Association Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance issued new public bonds to reorganize old debts, with a total issuance of 60 million yuan. The bond regulations and the principal and interest repayment schedule have been drafted by the Department of Finance and passed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government's meeting. Director of the Department of Finance, Cheng Yuanfan, took them to the capital to submit them to Finance Minister Kong for review. The specific plan for reorganizing old debts has also been changed and finalized. The central point of the change is to divide the old seven public bonds issued by Zhejiang Province into four types (A, B, C, and D) for collection and reorganization. The repayment period is also divided into four periods: 14 years, 16 years, 18 years, and 20 years. Type A is the Highway Public Bonds and the Repayment of Old Debts Public Bonds, with a repayment period of 14 years and an annual interest rate of one percent, now reduced to 0.9 percent. Type B is the Construction Public Bonds and the Disaster Relief Public Bonds, with a repayment period of 16 years and an annual interest rate of 0.8 percent, now reduced to 0.7 percent. Type C is the Clearing Old Debts Public Bonds and Treasury Bills, with a repayment period of 18 years. The annual interest rate of the Clearing Old Debts Public Bonds is 0.8 percent, now reduced to 0.7 percent, while the monthly interest rate of the Treasury Bills remains unchanged at 0.5 percent. Type D is the Local Public Bonds, with a repayment period of 20 years and an annual interest rate of 0.6 percent, which remains unchanged. After reorganization, each public bond will still be calculated at 100 yuan. Whether the lottery will be drawn evenly each year has not yet been determined. However, in order to maintain credit, the 13th Construction Public Bond and the 9th Treasury Bill lottery for principal and interest payments at the end of April will still be handled according to the original plan. As for the portion of the loan collateralized by the Shanghai-Hangzhou banking industry, the Department of Finance will negotiate individually and handle it separately. The following is the telegram sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to the Shanghai Banking Association: (Omitted Title) Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, Zhejiang Province has undertaken construction projects, with huge expenditures. After the elimination of taxes, income has decreased significantly. In recent years, it has also suffered from disasters, and tax revenue has been even shorter. Budgetary income and expenditure have not been balanced, and the annual deficit has always relied on borrowing to make up for it. To date, the total amount of bonds issued, unpaid principal, interest on various loans, and funds to be allocated amount to more than 57 million yuan. The depth of accumulation is undeniable. It is estimated that the debt burden to be paid in the 25th year amounts to more than 11.11 million yuan. The amount is so large that it exceeds one-half of the total annual income of the province. Currently, when preparing the budget, debt expenses cannot be shortened, and various administrative expenses cannot be reduced. Since income is difficult to meet expenses, the budget cannot be established, and even the originally designated debt fund is unavoidable. If we do not take timely measures to reorganize, it will be difficult to continue to maintain. Rather than losing credit in the future, we should plan in advance. The provincial government is planning to reorganize debts this time, not only to alleviate financial difficulties, but also to stabilize future credit. It has already transferred the Department of Finance to consider and handle the issuance of reorganization public bonds. The issue of postponing interest reduction will be considered in detail, taking both sides into account. The loan portion will also never unilaterally abolish the original agreement. At this time of local financial crisis, the people and the government are closely related. Your association manages the city's finances and hopes to discuss it in detail to maintain the overall situation. Please inform and forward to all bondholders for their information.</p>

<p>The second phase of issuing opium smoking licenses in this city began on the 1st. All smokers in this city should apply for registration and license renewal at the sub-bureaus and patrol teams in their place of residence. The deadline for license renewal is May 31st. Those who fail to renew their licenses after the deadline will be prosecuted by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for smoking without a license. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the license renewal has already begun. It is feared that many smokers in this city still do not thoroughly understand the significance of license renewal and the penalties. In order to prevent the foolish people from testing the law, it has been specifically decided that from today, it will cooperate with the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee to organize a propaganda team to adopt a citywide district propaganda system. Teams will be dispatched within the jurisdiction of each sub-bureau to distribute propaganda materials to the public and give open-air lectures to awaken the public's attention. Last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau organized the registration of smokers. The citywide register of smokers has been completed by the bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Military Commission for review. There are a total of 30,833 smokers in the city, with a citywide population of 2,028,814 people. On average, there are 15 smokers per thousand citizens.

<h3 id="e122">A Report on the Exhibition of New Handicrafts on the German Round-the-World Giant Ship – Sports Equipment and Various New Literary and Art Supplies, as well as Models of Trains, Cannons, and Silver Airplanes – The Revival of Germany is Certainly Not Accidental <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) The annual world tour ship has become a very fashionable trend in recent years. Major European and American shipping companies are trying to figure out the psychology of passengers and are making meticulous designs, using excellent giant ships and special arrangements to ensure that passengers do not feel bored or lonely during long voyages. This time, the German Hamburg America Line's world liner, the Reliance, is such a plan.</p>
<p>Touring Shanghai</p>
<p>The Reliance, from New York, USA, via the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the Far East, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The voyage has lasted 86 days, and two-thirds of the 40,000-mile journey has been completed. The 232 members toured Shanghai yesterday, and this morning they must set sail for Qinhuangdao to visit North China, explore the scenic spots of the Great Wall, and admire the greatness of the ancient palace. Then, they will follow Japan, cross the Pacific Ocean, and return to the United States, which will require another 53 days of voyage before returning to New York.</p>
<p>Handicraft Exhibition</p>
<p>It is heard that Hamburg America Line and North German Lloyd are the two major shipping companies in Germany. This time, the world ship is dispatched to the Reliance, which is the first time to the Far East. The equipment and decoration of the ship are beautiful and magnificent, and it can really surpass the "Queen Mary". After arriving in Shanghai, in order to facilitate the members to get on and off, it specially docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Because there is an exhibition of new German handicraft products in the ship, the reporter obtained a visiting certificate in advance and went to the ship for sightseeing at 11:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Spring Breeze Like Scissors</p>
<p>Not many visiting certificates were issued for this exhibition, and the time was limited to 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. In the spring breeze like scissors, the reporter went to Gonghexiang Wharf by car with unlimited hope. He saw a white giant ship like a palace on the sea, already docked. The coolies on the pier were busy loading and unloading goods from the Ewo and Tonghe ships, and the sound was endless. At the docking place of the giant ship, there were piles of bronze porcelain jade wares leather goods, colorful and all over the ground. These are all antique dealers taking the opportunity to catch customers, hoping that the tour members will buy their items.</p>
<p>Start Visiting</p>
<p>When the reporter boarded the ship, he was greeted cordially by the crew at the entrance. Most of the visitors to the ship were Westerners, and there were only a few Chinese. The Chinese and Westerners who came to the ship mostly came with the same purpose: to visit the exhibits. A crew member led me through the magnificent hall and dining room, over two decks, to the highest Su Deck, and then began to visit the exhibits.</p>
<p>Sports Equipment</p>
<p>What is displayed on the upper deck is completely sports equipment, with hundreds of items. The reporter is a layman to sports. Football basketball racket ball tennis are all available. Each category has the name of the factory and instructions, but all are in German. A crew member performed and explained the racing boat, the push-pull machine used to practice arm strength, and the freehand exercise equipment. Then he went to the exhibition room of handicraft products, which contained all the items used in the latest garden houses. The crew member also pointed out that this material has been used in the "Reliance" ship to install the "New Era" room, which is strong, beautiful, and both.</p>
<p>Literary and Art Supplies</p>
<p>Secondly, he went to the literary and art supplies exhibition room. Almost all stationery and supplies are available, and all are novel. The most important are Montblanc fountain pens and pencils. There are a total of two hundred and several kinds of fountain pens, and there are also more than seventy kinds of pencils. There are also new-style leather notebooks, exquisite and elegant, which have not been seen at sea. As for the newly produced porcelain and glassware in Germany, they are arranged on the table, one category per table. One type is similar to cloisonné, but without flowers. There is also an agricultural product exhibition room, all of which are pure steel hoes, or three-bend hooks, or five-pointed rakes, which have never been seen in China, all Wol brand.</p>
<p>Trains and Cannons</p>
<p>Finally, visit the new-style train model, another room is arranged, and the room is equipped with upper and lower intersecting circular railway lines, and car routes. The train is divided into electric vehicles and steam vehicles, a total of four or five kinds, and the cars are also divided into several categories, all Ma klin brand. The manager turned on the motor, the pole lights in the railway were all lit, and each train flowed around, up and down staggered, and galloped. The cars also rushed up and down, but the car road was all three tracks. In the railway room, there were also displayed large cannon models, which can automatically go up and down, armored tank models, and cavalry models, which are military representations.</p>
<p>Silver Airplane</p>
<p>After the reporter visited this room, he was led by the crew to the front cabin to visit various different aircraft models displayed, including seaplanes, passenger planes, and other application planes, each with a number, and the body was silver. All are hung in the middle. In addition, there are Siemens' new products of machine parts and supplies. At this time, the reporter was dazzled and unable to see everything. Because the time had reached twelve o'clock, he resigned and returned on the way. Nian Germany's revival is really not accidental.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Zhou Shimin Sued by Maid for Obscenity Case; After Mediation, it is Known to be Settled; Yesterday's Continued Hearing Approved Withdrawal <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong merchant Zhou Shimin is a major shareholder of the Shanghai China Insurance Company. His family lives at No. 10 Fen'anfang, Dongxi Huade Road, Public Concession. Last month, Zhou was suddenly sued in the First Special District Court by a Ningbo woman named Zhang Jinxiu, who worked as a maid in his house, for the crime of obscenity. The general idea of her complaint is: Zhang Jinxiu has been working as a maid in Zhou's house. She is over the age of maidenhood and has a pretty appearance. Zhou Shimin saw her beauty and inevitably had ulterior motives. He took the opportunity to seduce her, but because his wife's surveillance was very strict, it was difficult to fulfill his wishes. Last spring, Zhou's wife gave birth, and the defendant was like a turtle escaping its shell, chasing the plaintiff. At that time, the defendant was still addicted to bad habits and was lying down all day alone with the lamp. He took the opportunity to seduce her under the pretext of asking the plaintiff to load cigarettes. He used sweet words, coercion, and inducement to the best of his ability. At that time, the plaintiff was also temporarily weak-willed and fell into his trap, and was raped. Moreover, she became pregnant because of this. Unexpectedly, good things are more tortuous, and the spring is leaked, and Zhou's wife found out. The voices of opposition rose. Zhou saw that things had reached this point and there was no way to deal with it, so he ordered Zhang Jinxiu to leave temporarily to avoid his edge. How could he have never heard from the defendant since then. Now Zhang Jinxiu is nine months pregnant, and for the sake of the piece of meat in her belly, she had no choice but to file a lawsuit, and asked the court to quickly summon the defendant Zhou Shimin to court for punishment according to the law, et cetera. The case has been approved by the court, and has been summoned and heard once. Because the defendant did not appear, the continued hearing was rescheduled to the 26th of last month. At that time, Zhou Shimin still did not surrender, and only entrusted lawyer Wei to appear in court, representing the statement that the defendant had just returned to Shanghai from Suzhou and suddenly suffered a cold, so he could not appear in court. He presented two prescriptions to the court on the spot and requested a reschedule. However, the plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the defendant had indeed personally gone to the law firm to handle the settlement procedures, but because the two sides were too far apart, they had not been able to reach an agreement. Now that he suddenly claimed to be sick, it was close to a pretext to evade. He should ask the court to issue a warrant for arrest. Then the judge Jiang Shuzi turned to question Zhang's purpose of filing the lawsuit. Zhang Jinxiu immediately proposed in court, requesting the court to order the defendant Zhou Shimin to pay a total of 11,190 yuan for living expenses and children's education expenses. At that time, the court warned her that it was not yet known whether Zhou Shimin was guilty, and it was not appropriate to demand such a large amount of money. However, because the defendant did not appear, there was no way to hear the case, so he declared that it would be rescheduled once again, and the continued hearing would be held on April 3, and Zhou's lawyer was ordered to inform the defendant that he must appear in court at the next hearing, otherwise he would be arrested. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the date of the continued hearing arrived again. Judge Jiang still sat in the first criminal court for the hearing. In addition to Zhang Jinxiu and the original defendant's lawyer, Zhou Shimin still did not appear in court. At that time, the court prohibited the public from listening to the hearing because the case involved obscenity, so the details of the hearing are not clear. However, it is reported that the mediation has been agreed in the second reschedule, so the court approved the withdrawal of the request from both parties at the same time yesterday, and the court ruled that Zhou Shimin was not guilty. A storm can be announced to be quelled.</p>

<p>The Liujiang Coal Mine in the Lin Yu County of Hebei Province was seized by a certain party, and more than 60,000 tons of coal in the mine were also seized. The Hebei Provincial Government has repeatedly consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan, but it has not been resolved. The Liujiang Coal Mine Company reported to the Coal Industry Guild of this city, and it was resolved to inform the industry that Liujiang coal must not be sold before the mine is recovered, otherwise the membership will be expelled and the industry will be economically cut off. However, Zhang Yanzhang, a Ningbo native, who opened the Youxin Coal Store at No. 1 Sanxinli, Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, ignored the resolution of the Coal Industry Guild and boldly purchased a large amount of Liujiang coal and tried his best to sell it. The Liujiang Coal Mine Company reported the information, and the guild investigated and confirmed that it was true. Zhang Yanzhang deliberately violated the resolution and revoked his membership, and informed the industry to implement an economic cutoff, and Zhang began to be isolated. However, he did not repent, but said that Liujiang damaged his reputation, and hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Liujiang, a Yuyao native, in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye held a hearing. The plaintiff admitted to selling Hebei coal, and then the defendant's lawyer stated the process of Liujiang being involved in government communication and the Coal Industry Guild's resolution one by one, and said that Youxin Coal Store's sale of coal violated the guild's resolution. The guild has investigated and confirmed that it is true, and asked the court to order witnesses to be summoned to court, which can prove it. The court then ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to Friday afternoon next week.</p>

<p>Ge Yunjin, the doorman of Ruihua Fang, Lane 285, Lafayette Road, French Concession, was suddenly attacked by three robbers in the police pavilion when he was on duty the night before last. The robbers took out iron bars and injured Ge's head and fled. Later, detectives Tao Desheng and Zhang Ziying of the French Concession Police Department, Bao Tan Tao Ronglin and Zhu Ju, and others successively arrested the perpetrators Pan Zhiyun (24 years old, Jintan native, living at No. 26 Delongfang, Laobote Road) and Cao Ziqing (25 years old, Haimen native, living at No. 2 Longxingfang, Kangnaotuo Road, Caojiadu), and seized two iron bars, and brought them into the police station for investigation. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The plaintiff Ge Yunjin was not present because he was seriously injured and was being treated in the hospital. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi requested a reschedule for investigation, and then Bao Tan Tao Ronglin said that the defendant and others went to the police pavilion of Ruihua Fang the night before last, falsely using the name of a lawyer from No. 24 of this lane, and called the plaintiff out. At that time, the plaintiff believed it to be true and poked his head out to ask, and was attacked by Ruo with iron bars and tried to seize the gun. Fortunately, the victim held the gun tightly with both hands, so he was not robbed. According to the interrogation of the two defendants, they admitted that they were instigated by Zhang Zhifeng, who was at large, to take revenge and seize the gun, and planned to rob the salary of a certain iron factory in Zhabei. When asked, Pan Zhiyun said that the civilians used to set up scenery in the Weiyang Grand Stage. Cao Ziqing introduced him to Zhang Zhifeng, who was at large. Zhang said that he was the son-in-law of a Sun family in Laoshenfu Road, because Ge Yunjin instigated and had an affair with Zhang's wife at his father-in-law's place. Also, when Zhang opened a cigarette paper shop at the entrance of Ruihua Fang last year, he was also played by Ge in front of the landlord and the shop was closed. Therefore, he hated him and called the civilians to help him take revenge, and instructed the civilians to hit Ge's lower body, et cetera. When asked Cao Ziqing, the confession was similar, but he denied planning to rob the gun, it was completely revenge. Judge Zhang Chaozuo ordered the defendants to be returned to prison, and the hearing will be held again on the 9th of this month. At the same time, he ordered the police to strictly arrest the principal offender Zhang Zhifeng for joint investigation.</p>

He also defrauded Liu Yuanfu, the owner of a woodworking shop at No. 334 Xiafei Road, of 160 yuan in property. The total amount defrauded from various places before and after was more than 10,000 yuan. The victims reported the fraud to the police and the court issued a warrant for his arrest, but he has not been arrested. Detective Jin Bingwen of the French Concession Police Station found that the Westerner had opened the Meihua Foreign Company at No. 205 Yuanmingyuan Road, British Concession, a fictitious name, and defrauded goods from various places again. Therefore, he went to the address and arrested Li Ruolaige the day before yesterday. According to the confession, he is an American citizen. After being sent to the US Consulate for investigation, he is not an American citizen. Therefore, he was still taken back to the French Concession Police Station by Jin Detective. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police prosecuted him for fraud and requested a reschedule for investigation. After Judge Qiu questioned the defendant, he ordered him to be returned to prison and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>

<p>The China Blind People's Institute on Hongqiao Road was founded 24 years ago. Hundreds of blind people, men, women, old and young, have benefited from it. In addition to providing food, clothing, and shelter, the Institute also provides considerable education and useful skills. This is the only organization in Shanghai that assists blind people to help themselves. In recent years, the number of blind people in need of assistance has increased day by day. The Institute currently supports about 90 Chinese blind people, and another 76 deaf-mutes. It all depends on the director, the Englishman Fu Yaji, and his wife to maintain it through fundraising. Because the donations received are not enough to cover the expenses, and the need for funds is urgent, a large group of enthusiastic women, including many famous figures in social circles and charitable causes, are willing to come forward to help. They will sell a kind of souvenir on various streets in Shanghai today, and the money earned will be used to subsidize the Institute. They also hope that the public will generously donate to the cause, so that the poor people who are sinking in darkness can get a little sunshine. Anyone who wants to visit the Institute can go at any time. The staff of the Institute is welcome, and it is also very interesting to see the hard-working and exquisite products made by blind children.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Amicable Insurance Company Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Amicable Life Insurance Company held a shareholders' meeting at 4:00 PM on the 3rd of this month (Friday) at its head office at Number 17, The Bund, Shanghai. The shares represented by the shareholders present exceeded the legal quorum. The meeting was chaired by General Manager Meng Fu, whose report briefly stated that although the general economic situation in China last year was not very good, the company's business still showed progress. The amount of insurance, the amount of reserves, and the assets all increased. The current total amount of insurance has reached 59,846,000 yuan, a record for the company. The liability reserve reached 6,601,274.14 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000,000 yuan compared to the previous year. As for the total assets, they were 7,204,795.67 yuan at the end of 1934, but increased to 8,305,866.50 yuan at the end of December last year. The total amount of new insurance added last year reached 12,462,189 yuan, of which 5,437,881 yuan were established in China, and 7,024,308 yuan were established in Annam, Malaya, and the Philippines. Therefore, in terms of new policyholders added last year, China saw a slight decrease, while other regions increased by 10%. (Omission) Furthermore, due to the failure of certain things in Shanghai last year, the company's investment suffered some losses. However, these losses were all covered by the company's reserves, so they will not affect the policyholders' reserves, nor will they damage the company's capital. Therefore, policyholder dividends can be paid as usual without any changes. This report can be said to be the end of the company's nineteenth year of operation. From the perspective of policyholders, this kind of achievement is very satisfactory. First, there is no change in the policyholders' dividends. Second, the company's economic strength is very strong. Even from the perspective of shareholders, it is very gratifying, because after the company is properly managed and the internal affairs are solid, even if the public reserve suffers a slight loss, the company's credit and the goodwill of the policyholders will definitely increase.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wang Shubao, Owner of the Xiang Stage, is Accused of Murder; the Cause is a Love Triangle Involving Actress Yu Yanfang; Five Years After the Incident, the Deceased's Mother Discovered the Truth and Sued in Court <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In a house at No. 100 Zhangjia Lane Road, Zhabei, during the chaos of the January 28th Shanghai Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China, a person named Ji Zhongtang from Hai'an, who was a detective in the former Municipal Police Bureau, was shot and killed by a group of rioters. Ji was injured and died on the spot. After the war subsided, the Police Bureau discovered two suspects in the case and sent them to the local court for interrogation. However, due to lack of corroborating evidence, they were released. Five years later, the deceased's family repeatedly investigated and learned that the main culprit in Ji's murder was a certain Wang, the owner of the Xiang Stage Theater. They filed a lawsuit with the local court prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation and punishment according to the law, in order to redress the injustice for the deceased. The court accepted the lawsuit and issued a summons for Wang, but he could not be found. Therefore, an arrest warrant was issued. A detailed report of the case is as follows:</p>
<p>The Shooting</p>
<p>The victim in the case, Ji Zhongtang from Hai'an, was in his thirties and had been a detective in the former Municipal Police Bureau. He was dismissed from his position due to a case and sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the local court. He was released from prison at the time of the January 28th Shanghai Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China. A friend of Ji's, a certain Sheng, and Yu Yanfang, an actress from the Xiang Stage Theater (from Zhenjiang, specializing in female roles, in her twenties), once had a love affair and lived together with great affection. Later, Yu Yanfang became a concubine. Yu Yanfang was eager to break away from her relationship with Sheng, but Sheng insisted on not wanting to, and a dispute arose. Sheng complained and threatened to harm Yu Yanfang. Before long, Yu Yanfang was walking alone one night and was attacked by a group of hooligans who threw excrement at her. A person named Zhou was arrested on the spot and sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the court. Zhou appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court, but before the case could be concluded, Zhou died of illness in prison. The matter between Sheng and Yu Yanfang remained unresolved and was about to become a stalemate. Ji, posing as a peacemaker, planned to mediate. He went to the Xiang Stage Theater to meet with Wang Shubao and Yu Yanfang to discuss the matter. However, on the way, he was lured by a group of rioters into the kitchen of a tea house owned by an old woman named Wei Chen in No. 100 Zhangjia Lane Road, where they threatened him with guns and shot at him. The bullet hit a vital spot, and Ji died on the spot. The perpetrators fled without a trace after the incident. At the time, only Zhang Xiaowanzi, who lived nearby, witnessed Ji's tragic death.</p>
<p>Innocent Suspects</p>
<p>After the war subsided, the deceased's family reported the case to the Police Bureau. Two suspects, Zheng Xiaoheizi and Shi Zitou, were arrested and sent to the local court for interrogation and then transferred to the criminal court. It was repeatedly heard that the court summoned them, but since Ji's family had no sufficient evidence to present, Zheng and Wang were found not guilty due to insufficient evidence and were released. Ji's mother was heartbroken that her son had been brutally murdered and the injustice had not been redressed. She repeatedly investigated and learned that the mastermind behind the murder was Wang Shubao, the owner of the Xiang Stage Theater (from Hai'an, in his fifties) on Middle Dalu Road. The cause was a love triangle involving Yu Yanfang. She invited Zhang Xiaowanzi, who had witnessed the incident, to testify and filed a lawsuit with the local court prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation and prosecution according to the law.</p>
<p>Arrest of the Mastermind</p>
<p>The court approved the lawsuit, and the prosecutor ordered an investigation. Ji's mother requested in court that an arrest warrant be issued for Wang to be brought to court for questioning. The prosecutor approved the request. The arrest warrant was dispatched to the French police station. The police were waiting for the warrant and, at around 6:00 PM, turned to the police station for assistance. They rushed to the Xiang Stage Theater on Middle Dalu Road to arrest him. The suspect Wang, fearing punishment, fled upon hearing the news and could not be apprehended. The police reported the situation to the court, and the court has issued an arrest warrant and is determined to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Estimated value of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan; mediation failed yesterday; Jin Liren stated in court that his wife's recent behavior was improper; it is also rumored that Jin and Lu's dispute has been resolved through mediation by someone.</p>
<p>Jin Liren (from Anhui), the former director of the Municipal Land Bureau, married Zhu Xueqing (originally named Lu Canjuan), a famous prostitute from Suzhou, as his second wife in the 32nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. It has been more than 30 years since then. After becoming the director of the Land Bureau, he built a five-story Western-style building at No. 302, behind the Da Guangming Cinema on Yike Road, as a place to live together. Recently, Jin and Lu Canjuan's husband was combined with the Yue woman Mai Peizhen and built a splendid Western-style house on the shore of West Lake.</p>
<p>A place to hide beauties, and cohabiting with a famous dancer at No. 37 Minzhuang Road in the city center, while failing to pay for his own living expenses for five months, she hired attorney Ling Qihong to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to mediate for divorce and to pay 60,000 yuan in maintenance. Jin also hired attorneys Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to raise jurisdictional issues, resulting in the failure of mediation. Lu then filed a lawsuit with the mediation office of the Shanghai Local Court to request separation and to pay 30,000 yuan in maintenance. Jin then pointed out that Lu had</p>
<p>Went to Hangzhou with the storyteller Feng Zimei (also known as Hedongsheng), resulting in another failed mediation. Jin then stated that Lu had taken away all of his shares, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings from the China Bank, with an estimated value of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. He then filed a petition with the mediation office of the Special First Court to summon Lu to court for mediation and return the property. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Meng Tingke of the Special First Court in courtroom number 12. Lu</p>
<p>Canjuan did not arrive, represented by attorney Ling Qihong, while Jin and attorney Wu Baotai appeared in court. Jin stated that he and the respondent were not formally married, only cohabiting. As for the items taken away, there were 215 shares of the China Bank, 5 shares of Shanghai Telephone Company, 50 shares of Gulaklund Lumps Company, as well as Hanyeping shares, China, China Fu, bank deposit slips, two boxes of leather clothing, Han jade antiques, silverware, etc., worth tens of thousands of yuan, and stated that this</p>
<p>The reason for the emotional change was that in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the respondent met a cousin named Zhou Shouan in the bookstore, and then Feng Zimei, a storyteller who sang "Guobaolu" with Tang Fengchun. At that time, I lived at No. 6 Baike Road. Later, Feng disappeared once, and people said that he was hidden by Mrs. Jin. When I heard this, I told her that people said I would be a cuckold, and you must respect yourself. But as I know now, Feng lived at</p>
<p>No. 4, next door to my house, and food was delivered by her. A Sichuanese man named Li can prove this. Also, in the 23rd year, I broke my arm and stayed in the hospital. Feng was at my house at that time, and Juefei, the abbot of a certain temple, can prove this, because Juefei was also there that day. Later, he sent Feng to the Xinxin Hotel first, and then sent Juefei to the Zhenhua Hotel by car. In short, I have lived with Lu Canjuan for 30 years.</p>
<p>Now, we have turned against each other to such an extent, and the reason is based on this. This incident has greatly affected my reputation, etc. Attorney Ling argued that the petitioner's petition was completely untrue, because Lu Canjuan is still living in one of Jin's residences, namely No. 302 Baike Road. As for the shares, they are registered in the petitioner's name, so what is there to return? Therefore,</p>
<p>Disagree with the petition. Jin then stated that these items were taken from Minzhuang Road. Judge Meng stated that since the respondent expressed disagreement, the mediation should be declared unsuccessful. However, according to the reporter's information, all the problems of the Jin and Lu couple have been resolved through mediation by certain celebrities.</p>

After questioning by the director, the child said that he lived in Longhua Xinqiaotou, both his parents were dead, and his grandmother went out to beg today and was lost on the way. He requested relief, etc. After hearing the confession, the director felt very sympathetic and immediately prepared a document to send to the bureau and then to the Poor People's Education and Care Institute for custody.</p>

This year, the Ningbo Gang transported several kinds of props from Ningbo to join the competition, which caused a stir far and wide. At that time, the viewers along the way will be extremely crowded, and it is feared that it will obstruct traffic. Yesterday, the director ordered the subordinate police to pay attention to the demons and strengthen the key roads with double posts to strictly protect them, so as to maintain order.</p>

<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>The designation of April 4th as Children's Day was initiated by the China Child Welfare Association. Now we are approaching the fifth observance. It coincides with the nationwide expansion of the Children's Year movement. Provinces and cities across the country are holding grand celebrations to awaken the public to the importance of promoting children's welfare, revitalizing the nation, and ensuring the prosperity of the country. This is the foundation.</p>
<p>Today's children are the masters of the nation's future. Confucius said: "The young are to be regarded with respect." A Western philosopher said: "The progress of national civilization follows in the footsteps of children." All of this can illustrate that children are the life of the nation, the source of civilization, the vitality of the country, and the essence of society, and cannot be ignored. Therefore, in this context, we have boundless hope for today's Children's Day. The celebration of Children's Day has even greater significance.</p>
<p>Only by nurturing healthy individuals can we have a healthy society. Only with a healthy society can we have a healthy nation. Therefore, in recent years, I have promoted this idea within our association and made it clear to the people of our country. Unfortunately, the work of child welfare is still in progress, but foreign aggression continues unabated. The foundation has not been strengthened, but it has been destroyed first. The strength has not been increased, but it has been hit again. Looking ahead, I am deeply apprehensive! To seek national salvation, we should start from the root and first cultivate the children on whom the life of the nation depends. With ten years of replenishment and ten years of education, we can educate and nurture the majority of children in the country. National difficulties can be resolved, foreign aggression can be permanently eliminated, and our 5,000-year-old Chinese nation can always stand tall and independent in the world.</p>
<p>The prosperity and decline of a country are determined by the quality of its children's education and upbringing. Therefore, the significance of Children's Day in this Children's Year is undoubtedly extraordinary and self-evident. Taking advantage of this period, let us further clarify its meaning as follows: It must be understood that children are the children of the nation, not the private property of their parents. Therefore, the nation should be responsible for their education and upbringing. Looking at European and American countries, they have established various institutions for child care to fulfill their responsibility of educating and raising children. This is one meaning; Children's education and upbringing must have equal opportunities, regardless of their wealth or poverty, and whether they have parents or not. They should all be able to get what they need, without worrying about food and clothing, and they should all be able to learn and develop their talents. We should start well and end well, so that they can become healthy individuals, to secure society and strengthen the nation. This is another meaning. I hope that all capable people in the country will promote this idea, encourage society, and urge the government to develop the cause of child welfare and build a long-term plan for cultivating talents! If we can do this from now on, national difficulties can be resolved, and foreign enemies will never be seen again. The Children's Day that we Chinese people celebrate today will not be in vain!</p>
<h3 id="e153">Educating Children and the Future of the Nation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Children are the seeds that perpetuate the life of the Chinese nation. The survival, prosperity, and decline of the Chinese nation's future depend entirely on today's children; whether today's children have a promising future depends on today's parents, today's society, and today's government. Therefore, today's parents, today's society, and today's government should earnestly take on the responsibility of caring for and educating children. Caring for and educating children is not just a matter for one family or clan; it has a great impact on the future of the nation and the country. As the saying goes, "Care for your own young, and extend that care to the young of others." So, we care for children, not just our own children. The National Government designated this year as Children's Year to make the people of the whole country aware of the importance of children to the nation and the country. At present, the general public in our country seems to have a too shallow concept of the nation, while their concept of the family seems to be too deep. If we can transfer the concept of planning for the family to planning for the nation, I dare to believe that the Republic of China and the Chinese nation would not have suffered such an unfortunate encounter today. Even if we have such an unprecedented crisis today, we can have the strength to overcome this danger and break through this difficulty. Unfortunately, the people of the whole country are still only planning for their own family, clan, and surname, and cannot plan for the entire nation and country. Therefore, although China has 450 million people, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, almost as many as all the countries in Europe, it is still inevitably oppressed, bullied, and dominated by a small number of ethnic groups!</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? To break it down; firstly, our 450 million people are like a pile of loose sand, without unity. Everyone is planning only for themselves, for their own family, clan, and surname, and not for the nation and country. This is the first reason. Secondly, we mostly do not thoroughly understand the principle of "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest." We only know about simply passing on the seed, but we do not know how to cultivate this seed. It must be known that it is useless to have many people who are not educated, and they have no power. In the world, there are often many uneducated people who are oppressed, bullied, and dominated by a small number of educated ethnic groups. Therefore, it is useless to only seek an increase in quantity without seeking an improvement in quality. Han Feizi once said: "A million ignorant people are as good as no people." Let us go to the straw huts to see our poor compatriots, and look at our coolie compatriots on the streets. They are not educated, they have no knowledge, and they have no national consciousness. The survival, prosperity, and decline of the nation and the country seem to have nothing to do with them. Let us go to the slums to see the situation of our poor children. Almost all ten children in our slums have diseases, either eye diseases or other diseases. They usually live in sewage, garbage piles, and coal cinder piles. They are not physically healthy, and they have no knowledge. How can such children have the ability and be able to raise their heads and show their faces for the nation and the country when they grow up! Ordinary people only know the superficial meaning of "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest," but they do not know that if we have offspring but do not educate them well, and let them be unrestrained and unworthy, or even squander their family fortune, it is even more unfilial. Mussolini said: "The fate of the nation depends on the increase in population." Only fathers can be said to be human! This sentence, although it does not fail to be a kind of outpouring of patriotic enthusiasm, if we are in China, where the population is already very large, if we only increase the quantity without improving the quality, then it cannot be regarded as truly loyal to the country. Therefore, our greatest task today is not only to pass on the seed, but also to cultivate excellent seeds. Everyone must think about the future of the nation and the country, care for children, and educate children, so that today's children will not become the seeds of national subjugation.</p>
<p>The German philosopher Fichte, who revived Germany, had the same opinion as me. At that time, Germany was oppressed by Napoleon and had no way out; therefore, he loudly called on the people of the whole country to "take it upon themselves to cultivate excellent national seeds." Later, in less than twenty years, Germany was saved from the root! We must not miss today's opportunity to hope that all fathers in the country will pay special attention to this. From now on, everyone must earnestly take on the responsibility of caring for children and educating children in order to revitalize our Chinese nation! During this Children's Year, we must not only strive to promote and implement children's undertakings, but also awaken the attention of the people of the whole country, so that they will have a new concept of children; we must also awaken the children of the whole country to recognize the importance of their own position. Today they are children, and in the future they will be the masters of the Chinese nation, and they will also be the elements that continue the life of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government will definitely work hard to promote children's undertakings within its capabilities, and will never dare to abandon its responsibilities; especially for the undertakings of poor children, we should pay special attention. The public housing for the poor planned and implemented last year is one example. Each poor people's village has two to three hundred or three to four hundred houses; in each poor people's village, what we pay the most attention to is the welfare of children. Our plan is to set up a simple clinic, a small school, and a children's playground in each poor people's village, so that poor children can go to the doctor when they are sick, go to school to study, and have a small garden to play in, so that they can no longer live in sewage and coal cinder piles. In addition, there is also a small children's care center. In addition, there is a poor children's nursery in Nanshi, and there are health clinics in various districts; we pay close attention to children's health and inspections, such as physical examinations for primary school students. However, children's undertakings are a great and important cause, which the government cannot do alone. The entire society and the government must work together to promote it in order to succeed. Therefore, today we must also call on the citizens of Shanghai to support the promotion of children's undertakings. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e154">This Year's Sino-Portuguese Cup Cancelled; Provisional Agreement for Portugal to Play China Team on the 25th <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Siliang, the Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, originally planned to be held in mid-April after the Shanghai Association donated a silver cup, has now been canceled. The reason is that one-third of the Western Football League's schedule remains unplayed, and the Portuguese team cannot spare the time to accept the invitation. Furthermore, after the World Games football preliminaries in Hong Kong are completed, the representative team must come to Shanghai to invite local strong teams to play three practice matches. The time will inevitably conflict, so it has been discussed with the Portuguese Sports Association to temporarily cancel this plan and to arrange a friendly match between the Portuguese team and our country's World Games representative team for mutual learning. The date is tentatively set for the 25th of this month. As for the three practice matches held by the World Games representative team in Shanghai, in addition to the Portuguese team, which has been decided, the other two matches are still being negotiated.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Our Country's Representatives to the Davis Cup Performed in Hong Kong Before Departing; Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua's Doubles Suffered an Unexpected Loss; In Singles, Xu Won, While Xu Weipei and Cai Huiquan Lost to Lin Zhen <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Davis Cup tennis competition is about to be held. Our country has decided to select Xu Chengji and Zheng Zhaojia as representatives to attend. Later, because Lin Baohua's skills also reached a high level and he was good at doubles, he was allowed to accompany the team abroad at his own expense, and Xu was appointed as the captain and Lin as the manager. Cai Huiquan, who had just returned from England, was considered to have excellent ball skills and was also willing to participate at his own expense, which was approved. Xu and Lin had already left Shanghai on the Italian ship "Lia" because the competition period was approaching. They arrived in Hong Kong at 7:30 AM on the 28th, and then at 11:30 AM they went to the Hong Kong Cricket Club's stadium to perform a match at the invitation of the club. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, they left Hong Kong on the same ship with Cai Huiquan. If time permits, they plan to land in various places along the way and play friendly matches with famous players in various places for practice. Zheng Zhaojia is still in the United States and will go directly to Europe to attend. The details of the match in Hong Kong are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Xu and Lin Unexpectedly Lost in Doubles</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, Xu Chengji, Lin Baohua, and others went to the Cricket Club's stadium and first played a doubles exhibition match with Cai Huiquan and Xu Weipei. The Xu and Lin team took a 3-1 lead, but the Cai and Xu team caught up and tied. The Xu and Lin team won another game and were caught up by Cai and Xu, and then won two consecutive games, defeating Xu and Lin 6-4. Due to time constraints, only one set of doubles was played. It was found that Xu and Lin's defeat was not because their ball skills were inferior to Cai and Xu, but because they were careless, resulting in an unexpected loss.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Defeated Xu Weipei</p>
<p>After the doubles match, Xu Chengji played a singles match against Xu Weipei. A total of two sets were played. Xu won with 6-0 and 6-1. Xu's performance in this match was quite good. His serve made it almost impossible for Xu to cope. He won very easily, without losing the demeanor of a famous player.</p>
<p>Lin Zhen Defeated Cai Huiquan</p>
<p>The next match was Lin Zhen against Cai Huiquan. Cai's ball skills were not bad, but his serving skills were very ordinary, and his strength was not as good as Lin Zhen's. Therefore, after winning the first game in the first set, Lin Zhen took back five games in a row. He quickly caught up to 3-5, and Lin Zhen won the last game, so he lost 6-3 first. In the second set, Lin Zhen took a 2-0 lead. Although Cai won back two games later, he still lost 6-2 again.</p>

<p>Yoyow will face the French Business Association; Yoyow's players will have to shoulder a dual workload; Tung Wah First Division will face Lacrosse again</p>
<p>Since the Western Football League accelerated its schedule, the order has gradually become tense, and the venues in Jiaozhou, Hongkou, and the Racecourse have gradually concluded. Therefore, all competitions have to be held entirely in Shen Garden and Yiyuan. Today there are only two matches each for the first and second divisions. Tung Wah Second Division will face Western Business, and the First Division will face Lacrosse again, both held in Yiyuan. Although Sun, Li, and Jia have gone to Hong Kong to attend the World Games preliminaries, based on the score of eight to three last week, they can still be confident of victory. Yoyow will face strong opponents in both the First and Second Divisions today. The Second Division will face St. Francis, which is also quite exciting. The First Division will face the undefeated French Business Association, which will be a bloody battle. During the period when Yoyow's three generals, Chen, Zhang, and Liang, are traveling south, both the forwards and defense will be affected. Today, they will encounter two strong enemies in a row, and the future of the championship will be greatly affected. Furthermore, Jiang Shan-jing and Zhong Yu-xiang are on a spring outing in Hangzhou. If they do not return in time, Zhang Rong and Xi Qiaosheng will replace them. Wang Cai-gao will continue to serve as the goalkeeper for both the First and Second Divisions. Sun Da-mao also has a dual workload.

<p>Rumors Benefit Many Parties; Standard Gold Briefly Excited; Outcome Still Returns to Stability</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw silver prices rise, and raw gold prices fall, but market sentiment remained positive. This was largely due to a rumor circulating since last Saturday that a certain bank was planning to export cash. The rumor boosted buying, also because raw gold could be used as legal tender collateral. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and New York remain stable. A very small number of Indian buyers at the 大條脚地關 (a specific location, likely a trading hub) were posting bids at the closing price. Sellers were offering at the posted price plus 0.0625, with buyers reportedly willing to wait at 0.0625 below the posted price. Forward silver prices in Montreux rose slightly. Exchange rates had begun to contract. London raw gold fell to one penny. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates revealed both London and New York were stable, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was posted at 1143.2 yuan. Off-market pre-market trading opened at 46 yuan strong, lacking sellers. Market sentiment remained positive, with major players such as 大德成, 元昌, 永福餘 all buying, driving the price up to 6.8 yuan. 福興, 永大, 大德成 then began selling, causing the price to fall to 6.3 yuan. The morning opened flat. Buying interest continued strongly after opening, leading to further increases, but many took the opportunity to sell at the higher prices. The price soon gradually declined. HSBC's posted exchange rates revealed both London and New York were stable. Prices fluctuated briefly, but a large number of large players cutting losses led to a period of weakness. After the silver equalization tax was announced to increase by half a percent, prices stabilized. Rumors continued to benefit the market, and buyers continued to be active, eventually pushing prices up again. The market was slightly erratic around noon, with a slightly flat outlook for the afternoon, although there was some brief stability. However, the final situation seemed unlikely to improve. Swap rates were posted by the long positions yesterday at five yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1146.4 yuan, the same as the previous close. Although 鼎康 was selling at 6.3 yuan, 大德成, 恒餘, 春源, 永惠祥, 鼎康, 天成祥 all entered the market, with Shanghai picking up May shillings at 4375 and half a penny, pushing the price up to 6.9 yuan. 恒昌, 永福興, 永生源, 永洽豐, 永大發 all actively sold, pushing the price back down to 6.2 yuan. 愼大, 永惠祥 took advantage of the lower prices to buy. HSBC's posted exchange rates revealed both London and New York were stable, still rising to 6.7 yuan. 愼大, 永恒餘 sold, falling to 6.1 yuan. 鼎豐, 乾元, 永洽豐, 永恒餘 continued to buy at the lower prices.

<p>Large Players Aggressively Pushing Up Public Bonds, Rises Still Seem Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market conditions continued to struggle with a weak rebound. Even with prices being pushed up, the rise still seemed weak. Observing the four types (乙, 丙, 丁, 戊) of bond being released over the past few days, only four types were being bought, apparently as a smokescreen. This has been going on for several days, and the quantity of sales greatly outnumbers the buys. Therefore, the forward prices of four of the bond types have risen a large amount in the past two days (1.20 yuan), while type 戊 has risen only 0.40 yuan. This shows that the unloading of the bonds has been organized. The sellers at the trading table acted with deliberation, whereas the buyers seemed to have an artificial air about them. The morale of the people can be seen, and there are few optimists. If the 甲 type slips even slightly, it will fall rapidly. Considering the number of disturbances and the emptiness of the peoples' hearts, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future. Otherwise, it would result in a repeat of the boring, meandering market. Opening yesterday saw types 4 and 35 being bought, and types 16, 26, and 47 being sold. The 甲 type, 16, was bought, and the retail sales also saw more buying than selling. Market prices across the board continued to rise by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. Type 丁 for this month rose by 0.65 yuan. The floating sales of types 11 and 16 were particularly high. Apart from the 甲 type being supported by type 16 and not seeing highs or lows, the rest saw consistent small retreats of 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The afternoon opening saw the sixteen type continuing to sell the aforementioned four types, and eleven and forty-three saw more buying. Therefore, although type 戊 fell by 0.25 to 0.4 yuan, types 乙 and 丙 rose by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Although 16 still saw buying, as 35 suddenly had a large number of longs being dropped and exiting, and the market lost 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, market prices were chaotic. Closing saw 16 once again focusing on pushing up the 甲 type, and the rest continued to see selling. Only 47 saw a bit of support. Therefore, aside from the 丁 type falling by 0.4 yuan, the rest continued to rise by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. The overall market conditions were that the large player longs had no way out, so they thought of raising prices to avoid a sharp fall. But the environment didn't permit it, and it was only seen that their efforts were fruitless. Yesterday's result was that prices continued to rise by 0.2, 0.3, to 0.45 yuan. Only type 戊 this month had fallen back by 0.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 3.945 million, of which type 丙 accounted for 1.665 million. The results of the rises and falls are compared in the table to the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: hundreds of yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (the 2nd), US stocks, bonds, and commodities, excluding miscellaneous grains, tended to rise because of the continued expansion of domestic commerce. The US dollar rose slightly due to looser European cables, and buyers scrambled. As a result, industrial stocks were raised to a new high since 1931. The market then turned to railway stocks. The early market advanced under the leadership of automobile and steel stocks. Commercial stocks rose, and mail order, copper, oil, aircraft, and electrical appliances were particularly outstanding. Rubber stocks rose slightly, and agricultural implements loosened at the end. Steel and automobile stock longs also began unloading in the afternoon. Small exchange stocks rose slightly. In the bond market, domestic bonds and corporate bonds were very strong. The total daily turnover was 2.19 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market rebounded and rose slightly. As the actual green foreign cotton turned up, morale was excited and Shenji simultaneously purchased a large quantity. According to market rumors, they were entrusted by a certain bank, and the mood grew increasingly nervous. However, trading of spot yarn felt increasingly sluggish. Broadly speaking, the market situation has not broken out of its hovering state.</p>
<p>Shenji Absorbs Large Quantities of Traded Yarn</p>
<p>The traded yarn market opened in the morning with slight increases in each month. Because American cotton had recovered, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was closed, and market sentiment was good. Although sellers continued to put on pressure, Shenji bought in large quantities, and the market situation turned firm. As a result, each month increased by 0.5, 0.6, or 0.7 角 (a unit of currency) compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw continued good conditions. Each month increased by 0.2 or 0.3 角. After the second session, it was heard that business in spot yarn was not smooth, and Changfeng sold. The trading within the exchange became extremely sparse. As a result, near months increased by 0.1 角 (a unit of currency) compared to the morning close, and far months fell by 0.2 角 (a unit of currency). Sold: Tongji 800 bales, Juxing 1050 bales, Hexing 950 bales, Changfeng 1700 bales, Tonghe 450 bales, Jinkang 750 bales, Shengyuan 500 bales. Bought: Tongji 1400 bales, Yuanji 750 bales, Shenji 1600 bales, Dachangcheng 1250 bales, Xiecheng 500 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales were clearer than the previous day. According to a survey, various groups bought a total of 470 bales for the entire day. The sales price increased by 0.5 角 (a unit of currency). The buying amount for each group is as follows.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Turns Firm, and Strength Reappears. Largely Because American Cotton Recovers and Shenji Purchases Aggressively, Tongji Also Increases Stakes, and the Market Mood Takes a Pretty Turn. Far Months Emerge Beyond the Five Yuan Mark, But Present Cotton Factories Reportedly Face Unusual Sluggishness</p>
<p>The traded cotton market opened in the morning, and American cotton rebounded by 8 to 13 points. Indian cotton saw only short position swap transactions and fell by 1 to 2 rupees and 25. The Osaka Sanpin cotton market was closed, and market sentiment turned nervous. Buying momentum was particularly strong, and the market price rose steadily. Changcun, Juxing, Meiji, and Dafeng sold, and Shenji, Changhe, and Tongji aggressively bought. As a result, with the exception of this month, each month went beyond the five yuan mark, and each month rose by 0.25 to 0.35 角 (a unit of currency) compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a relatively dry trading table and good momentum. Each month continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.1 角 (a unit of currency). As the second close approached, it turned peaceful again. As a result, each month increased by 0.05 to 0.1 角 (a unit of currency) compared to the morning close. Sold: Meiji 4800 piculs, Juxing 4100 piculs, Changfeng 7500 piculs, Runkang 1000 piculs, Shengyuan 2300 piculs, Yikang 1500 piculs, Ruiyuan 2100 piculs, Dafeng 1200 piculs, Ruida 2500 piculs, Yongda 1100 piculs.

The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Consumption of Spot Cotton Grows More Sluggish</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton has turned sluggish and the factory needs are increasingly deserted. 280 bales of Laiyuan Yao cotton and 310 bales of Tong cotton arrived.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 55.75, Rihua Factory Inlets 84 Pieces Spot Goods Sent to Factory</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn and Cotton Market of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange will be closed for three days on the 10th, 11th, and 13th of this month.

<p>(Hankou Correspondence) Cotton in the city is scarce due to the high prices in the producing areas. City reserves are less than 80,000 bales, and quite a few of these are in the hands of hoarders. As it is between harvests, they expect market prices to rise and are unwilling to sell. In addition, the cotton reserves of the Hankou yarn factories are extremely low. Along with the brisk sales of yarn, buying will inevitably rise. The yarn factories in Hunan and Jiujiang are taking the opportunity to buy, and Shanghai factories and speculators, seeing the rise in Shanghai cotton prices, are also buying in Hankou. Therefore, the market is active. Because hoarders are unwilling to sell, market prices have a tendency to continue to rise. Reserves surveyed in the middle of the month: 62,000 dan of fine staple cotton, 18,000 dan of coarse staple cotton. The price per 100 市斤 (a unit of weight): 41 yuan for superior grade fine staple cotton, 39 yuan for ordinary, 38 yuan for superior grade coarse staple cotton, 36 yuan for ordinary.</p>
<h3 id="e183">US Cotton Market Gradually Stabilizing <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening of the American cotton market saw traders and foreign companies buying and few sellers. New buyers appeared, and each month increased by 1 to 5 points. After careful research, some merchants believe that the proposed cotton lending program is constructive, as the lending limit is low, low prices can be avoided, and it does not compete with new cotton. Therefore, the market gradually stabilized. Afterwards, there was slight hedging and profit-taking, but the increased demand for July was absorbed. As a result, there were 13 points, and futures rose 9 to 13 points. British spot cotton fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 2 points. Indian cotton saw slight speculative buying, and recent short positions moved to far months. Calicut fell by 1 rupee, Oomra fell by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Broach fell by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left. (Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Also, according to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for the March/April/May period was 198.5 rupees, up 1.75 rupees from the previous day's close, and the opening forecast for Broach for the July/August period was 200.5 rupees, up 1.75 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the imported rice market, continued arrivals from various ports in the Yangtze River and Wenzhou and Taizhou, but limited arrivals. Owners' thoughts remained tight. However, due to the approach of the Qingming Festival, local customers' sales were stagnant. Although small hoarders were active, trading was small, and some floating parties sought to sell. This market's appetite was also not as active as it had been a few days ago. Prices at each top-tier level uniformly trended weaker. Although the market was similar to the previous day, the actual value has been reduced by 2 or 3 分 (a unit of currency). However, if sales are strong after the festival, the market can turn around. Total daily openings: 1,670 packages of Jiangxi rice, 68 packages of Wuhu and Anqing, 600 packages of Jiangbei fire rice, 150 packages of Taizhou rice, and a shortage of 50 packages of broken rice.</p>
<p>There was spotty light rain in the southwest United States. Prices fell due to weakness in foreign markets and short-sellers unloading. Tang Mawen estimated the harvest of winter wheat at 530 million bushels, and Snow estimated it at 520 million bushels.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the various groups' sources increased compared to before, with a total of more than 40 groups arriving (totaling more than 9,000 石). Retail sales were slack, and only the Tianjin and Qingdao groups handled 1,400 or 1,500 packages. Therefore, the market was weak. Thick early japonica rice prices fell by 0.15 to 0.20 yuan. Thin indica rice fell by slightly more. Du Yangjian rice has not been traded, apart from Bian Yuan Ping rice trending weaker.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the weather was sunny and warm. There were 32 or 33 sources downriver. Store employees were mostly returning home to sweep graves, and trading was small.

<p>The soybean oil cake market was characterized by low spot arrivals and active sales, resulting in insufficient reserves. Furthermore, prices in the producing areas steadily increased, especially with frequent price rises communicated from Liaoning. The market was always optimistic. Yesterday, due to consecutive market holidays, local firms received telegrams from Dalian, noting that spot prices there were climbing intermittently. There were also numerous rumors in the market, with news spreading that a certain party was aggressively buying. As a result, market sentiment grew even firmer. Businesses and groups covering their positions were active. The afternoon saw even more dramatic gains, with the listed oil for April/May rising sharply by 0.65 yuan. The listed prices for other months also increased by 0.035 to 0.05 yuan, and listed soybean cake also increased by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan, while listed soybeans increased by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan.</p>
<p>The soybean oil cake market was in high spirits. The rally has not stopped. Although spot sales lacked large-scale purchases, the tendency remained strong due to the combined effects of environmental conditions and tight supplies. Yesterday's market recorded three train cars of Chen soybeans from Bengbu, 1,600 packages of border soybeans from Hankou, 300 packages of Du soybeans, 500 packages of Sha Huang soybeans, 29,500 pieces of soybean cake for both spot and future delivery, 720 pieces of soybean oil for both spot and future delivery, and 550 pieces of peanut oil.</p>

<p>Since sesame oil prices surged to 25.6 yuan last week, producing areas have also taken notice and prices have risen. As a result, the volume of goods arriving from various sources remains low. Coupled with the daily rise in raw material costs, owners' intention to sell has become firmer. It was reported that 340 or 350 cans of Huaiyuan goods had been opened previously, but the price increased to 27 yuan as a local business bought them, increasing sharply by 1.4 yuan. It is noted that there were approximately 30,000 cans of accumulated goods in the city. Although there were no large transactions, prices cannot be ignored due to the high price of raw materials.</p>

<p>Due to the thin harvest last year, the amount of Jinshan lychee dries arriving and in stock was low. Therefore, prices were very high. However, businesses in the industry predict that this year's harvest will increase. According to news from the producing areas, the seedlings have not sprouted due to the unresolved spring chill. Observations regarding the harvest are uncertain. Therefore, Shanghai has not seen much activity. Current stocks in the market are indeed limited, with only slightly more than 100 boxes of flat twigs and 400 or 500 boxes of round twigs. Traders are calling for 82 or 83 yuan for high-quality flat twigs and 70 yuan for high-quality round twigs, with lower prices for lower quality goods.</p>

<p>Domestic woolen fabrics have seen continued and broad sales recently. Zhanghua and Haijing have both released samples of Western-style suit materials. In recent years, all sectors have favored wearing domestic goods. Currently, popular and affordable woolen fabrics like serge and tweed in various men's and women's colors are selling well. Yihua's sales are particularly strong, followed by Zhanghua in second place, Haijing in third, and then Unified and Wuxi Xiejing. Hailin's thick serge, 918 serge, and various Huate tweeds are even more renowned, displaying a bold ambition to defeat imported goods. In the capital, sales of domestic woolen fabrics and knitwear have surged. Yesterday, Unified's No. 1 Western suit fabric sold for four yuan and thirty cents, No. 2 for three yuan and sixty cents. Xiejing's medium-thick serge was four yuan and twenty cents, checkered gabardine three yuan and fifty cents, and Zhanghua Jingqing fabric sold for one yuan and sixty cents.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Metals  West Iron Sales Brisk  Significant Arrivals of Big Guangdong Leather <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>West iron manufacturers have been expanding their business considerably in recent days, with dozens of transactions occurring daily. Customer support is also strong, leading to a particularly prosperous market trend. Prices are quite firm due to holders' insistence on high prices and scarce arrivals. Each box sells for thirty-five yuan, five jiao more than before. According to overseas pricing, the most recent price is seven yuan and five jiao in gold, and there are no spot goods arriving in Shanghai in the near future, so the market situation is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>The source of Big Guangdong leather has always been mostly British, American and German goods. Recently, however, Japan has also shipped a large quantity of spot goods. The market is softer than before, with each picul selling for eight yuan, two jiao and five fen (thick colorful), while thin colorful sells for nine yuan, four jiao and five fen per picul. Transactions are sluggish due to inactivity by customers, resulting in a rather stagnant market.</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Today is Children's Day, a grand festival for children to rejoice and dance; this day can be said to belong entirely to children. While we sincerely celebrate, we should also seek happiness for the children, so we specially publish a "Children's Happiness" special page as a small gift. The selected articles within will contribute in some measure to the children's intellectual, moral, and physical education. Please, children, do not be shy and accept them all. We usually welcome the children's works very much, and they have been sending them in droves; however, due to limited space, we cannot publish many, which is very regrettable. For the Children's Day today, to make the children happy, we have selected and published several articles and created a special "Children's Corner" page. For example, when children hold a celebratory performance for Children's Day at school, everyone performs on stage; we are attentively watching and listening from the audience, ready to applaud and praise.</p>
<h3 id="e193">How to Get Rid of Bad Habits? <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Dear children, today I am here to talk to you about the problem of habits.</p>
<p>In our daily life, diet, actions, and speech, everyone has some habits; if these habits are good, then their life is also good; if their habits are irregular, then their life is also irregular. For example, someone who is in the habit of getting up early, loving cleanliness, studying diligently, abstaining from snacks, and saving money, do you think this is a good life habit? Who wouldn't like a child who has these good life habits? Being a good student at school and a good child at home is the most honorable thing, and these glorious honors all come from having good life habits.</p>
<p>For example, among your classmates, there is a child who is always late for the first class because he gets up late, so will the teacher and classmates praise him? Every time he is unable to recite or write from memory because he is unwilling to study diligently, do you want to make fun of him? Also, because he doesn't know how to be clean, he often gets a large patch of ink on his face and shirt, and wipes clumps of snot on his sleeves, do you find him disgusting? If he doesn't know how to treat people kindly and often scolds his classmates for small things, do you like him? I think you probably won't like such a detestable person, will you? Do you know why he is not liked by you? This is because bad life habits have harmed him, because he has not developed good habits!</p>
<p>Dear children, after seeing the two examples I mentioned above, everyone must have a good understanding in their hearts. Now I will say a little more, that is, habits are not innate, but are learned one by one. Habits are formed in childhood, so in childhood, you must be careful about all your actions, and always ask yourself: "Is what I am doing good? Or is it bad?" If you feel it is bad, you must correct it immediately and not be sloppy. If you are sloppy, it will become a bad habit in the future, and it will be very difficult to change at that time.</p>
<p>Good children, they will often examine themselves and will not be harmed by bad habits.</p>
<h3 id="e194">How to Study Science? <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>To be a person in the modern world, one should have some basic knowledge of various sciences; and the first step in studying various sciences must start from childhood.</p>
<p>Some people say: Children's minds are simple, so children are not easy to learn science.</p>
<p>Precisely because children's minds are simple, children are easier to approach science than adults. Science is nothing more than the study of the conditions under which special events occur. From a child's simple mind, everything is special and enough to arouse his curiosity and desire for knowledge. The sun, moon, stars, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, as well as everyday events such as water boiling in a pot placed on the fire and a stone falling down, are generally considered obvious and unquestionable events by sophisticated adults, but for innocent children, there is always the question of "how it happens." Doubt is the only important condition for studying science; children who are good at doubting are of course more likely to learn science naturally than adults. There are many opportunities for children to acquire scientific knowledge. How to use these opportunities to instill scientific knowledge into children is the responsibility of adults who are responsible for educating children.</p>
<p>Some people also say: Science is dry and boring, not liked by children's nature.</p>
<p>This statement is even more wrong. As long as the teaching is proper, science is not only often interesting but also has the beautiful fairyland in fairy tales that children's nature likes.</p>
<p>"Sleeping Beauty in the Woods" is one of the fairy tales that children love to hear. In this story, the fairy used her magic in a fit of anger. As a result, the princess in the palace, the horses in the stable, the dogs in the courtyard, the pigeons on the roof, the cooks in the kitchen, and all the courtiers of the emperor and empress were put to sleep by her magic. A dense fence grew around the palace, and the interior of the palace became as silent as death. It wasn't until a brave prince came a hundred years later that the fence of thorns, wearing bright floral clothes, unraveled before him; the prince entered the palace and went to the room where the princess was sleeping soundly, and a sweet kiss instantly revived her and the people around her.</p>
<p>Are there similar fairy tales in science? Yes. Water is a very busy and very active thing in the world. It either flows in the river, or rushes against the rocks, or splashes from the fountain, or drips from the roof, and when the wind blows on the surface of the pond, it wrinkles into whirlpools. However, this busy and active water can sometimes suddenly be enchanted and become completely still. On a cold winter morning, looking out the window, the river that was still flowing next to the house yesterday is now still, and the rocks that were washed by the river are surrounded by hard ice. The ripples on the pond have stopped moving. The water droplets dripping from the roof have become transparent icicles. Every tree has crystal-like water droplets dozing there. The fountain has become a glass tree, hanging upside down with many transparent, long, pointed leaves. It turns out that they have all been enchanted by the "Ice Fairy," who holds "ice" tightly, not letting it slip away.</p>
<p>After a few weeks, maybe a few days, maybe only a few hours, the brave sun shines on the earth. The gray clouds dissipated before him, just like the fence in the story unraveled before the prince: the sunlight and the frozen water gave a gentle kiss, and it melted, just like the prince's sweet kiss revived the princess. So the river flowed again, the water droplets dripped again, the fountain splashed again, and everything returned to life under the bright and warm sunlight.</p>
<p>In science, there are countless beautiful and moving stories like fairy tales. Who says science is dry and boring?</p>
<p>The field of science is infinite, and the life of a person is limited. Children who aspire to study science must not miss the opportunity to learn early!</p>
<h3 id="e195">How to Improve Your Writing? <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Sijun</p>
<p>Children: In your Chinese language class at school, the subject with the fewest points is probably writing. You may think that writing is difficult, but it is not. Here are some ways to tell you how to improve your writing.</p>
<p>People in the past have long said that to be good at Chinese and write well, you should read, read, and write more, but there is still room for discussion on how to read, read, and write more.</p>
<p>What should you read more? I think that to improve your writing, you should not only read Chinese, but you should read all kinds of books. why? Because writing represents language, and you must know something before you can speak it, so you must also know something before you can write it. To know something, you must read all kinds of books. Reading only Chinese will limit what you know.</p>
<p>The method of reading more should be to read more Chinese books. Because reading more is to seek more knowledge, the scope should be wide. Reading more is not only to seek knowledge, but also to study its structure, sentence structure, and rhetoric. In other words: it is not only to seek its content, but also to study its form; that is, words. Chinese books are more particular about literature, so reading more is limited to Chinese.</p>
<p>In addition to writing in school, you should also practice writing automatically. It is better to write diaries than to write many long articles automatically. why? Because at this time, your knowledge is not wide, and your thoughts are immature, so you will feel difficult to write. Diaries are not limited by topics, regardless of length. As long as you have some feelings or trivia, you can write. Therefore, writing diaries is the best way to practice writing.</p>
<p>In addition, to improve writing, you must also practice two things: one is observation, and the other is thinking. Observation allows you to increase your knowledge; thinking allows you to train your thinking. Both are indispensable elements for improving writing.</p>
<h3 id="e196">How to Choose Story Books? <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The story books currently popular in the market generally fall into the following three types:  Mythical stories,  Famous people stories,  Science stories.</p>
<p>Mythical stories are divided into two types: one is issued by formal bookstores, which are all stories about wind old men, snow girls, monkey brothers, white rabbit sisters, as well as moon palace fairylands, and island gods. There is also a kind that is printed by informal bookstores? and sold by door-panel book stalls, such as sword fairies, knights, fox spirits, and monsters.</p>
<p>Among the stories of famous people, there are famous people from China and foreign countries, ancient and modern, such as politicians, scientists, explorers, loyal ministers, filial sons, and martyrs. But at the same time, there are also many that are compiled with the traditional feudal ideology of China as the center.</p>
<p>Because science stories are children's reading materials, many of them deliberately make scientific principles overly magical in order to arouse children's reading interest. But there are naturally very reasonable ones.</p>
<p>Recently, according to a friend who works in the book industry, "Mythical stories sell the best, followed by stories of famous people, but only 15% of the sales of mythical stories. Science stories, except for those that are too magical, almost like magic, can occasionally sell a few copies. Reasonable science stories are simply not asked about. After publication, there is no possibility of reprinting."</p>
<p>Then, I met a friend who was a primary school principal and talked to him about the problem of primary school students reading stories. He said, "Primary school students in the early grades love to read stories such as wind old men and snow girls. High school students love to read sword fairies and knights. This is almost a common phenomenon in the primary school student world. Stories of famous people and science stories are forced upon high school students, but they seem to have no interest at all, and they are not as interesting as reading mythical stories."</p>
<p>Why are meaningless mythical stories so popular, and more valuable stories, such as stories of famous people and science stories, unpopular with children?</p>
<p>Although this is a small problem, I think this is quite serious for the future of children, so I specially put it forward and ask educators to find ways to correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e197">How to Organize a "Reading Friendship Association"? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Geng</p>
<p>Dear children, after your classes, when you are on Sundays or holidays, don't you feel the monotony and boredom of reading alone? I know that you have also lost interest in self-study alone, and you have also encountered difficulties in understanding the books because of reading alone. Now I would like to launch a "Children's Reading Friendship Association" to help you solve difficulties and to adjust your monotony.</p>
<p>This "Children's Reading Friendship Association" can be established with two or more people. We don't need to collect membership fees, etc. As long as everyone takes out their own books, chooses a relatively quiet place, and everyone reads, reads, writes, and does the homework that the teacher asks us to do outside of class together. If there are places that we don't understand, we research and discuss them with each other. If we encounter problems that cannot be solved, we can temporarily retain them and ask our parents and teachers for guidance.</p>
<p>In addition to the mutual discussion of reading, we also need to seek cooperation in labor, and we also need to seek contact in friendship. A small group is a microcosm of society. If you get used to the collective life of the group, then you will not feel strange when you step into society in the future.</p>
<p>Here, let me put the charter of the "Children's Reading Friendship Association" below:</p>
<p>1. Name - Children's Reading Friendship Association.</p>
<p>2. Purpose - The purpose is to discuss knowledge, connect feelings, and develop the habit of group life.</p>
<p>3. Members - If the character is upright and those who are determined to study, they can be members of this association.</p>
<p>4. Organization The association has one president, who is responsible for convening, and two executives, who are responsible for the arrangement of the association.</p>
<p>5. Instructor - The association may hire one parent and teacher as instructors, who are responsible for teaching.</p>
<p>Dear children, after reading the above five very simple articles of association, I think it is definitely not a very difficult thing, right? I hope that in the future, you will invite a few classmates or neighboring children to prepare together and organize a very sound "Children's Reading Friendship Association" to work hard on the discussion of your knowledge, the connection of feelings, and the development of group life habits.</p>

<p>— Huang Ruikun, student of Shanghai Municipal Peiben Primary School</p>
<p>Dear children!</p>
<p>Children's Day is here, how should we commemorate it? Is it to use the money your parents give you to buy some delicious candies and invite your good friends. Or invite a few children to your home to hold a small celebration party to commemorate it. But this is not the true meaning of commemorating Children's Day. They are all wasteful of money and time, and unconscious actions. So how should we commemorate it?</p>
<p>In today's situation where the country is in trouble and the shame has not been washed away, I hope that children, starting from this year's Children's Day, will be determined to be good students who are capable and promising, use our calm minds, sharp eyes, and exquisite wrists, work hard to seek knowledge, work hard, cultivate a share of vitality for the Republic of China, create a share of glory for the Chinese nation, and wipe away the stains on human society, so as not to fail today's Children's Day.</p>
<p>Children! Let's encourage each other!</p>
<p>Your child Huang Ruikun April 4th</p>

<p>Since Principal Wu painted Mr. Ling Qizhao's article "How to Organize a Children's Science Research Association" on the sign and guided us to organize it, a semester has passed in a hurry. Looking back on the work of this association this semester, it can be considered diligent. I am the captain of the ten-person team. I have to attend a team leader meeting once a week? Discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Principal Wu said: "Your results are very good." Naturally, we dare not be complacent. We have a total of more than 600 reports, more than 200 kinds of specimens, and many kinds of flowers and fish purchased from books, newspapers, instruments, etc. have grown up.</p>
<p>Okay, after school starts, we will work harder. When summer vacation comes, I will report again!</p>

<p>— Zhang Huailiang, student of Suzhou Jinghai Primary School</p>
<p>Dear children, do you know the benefits of saving? Now I will tell you a story, like the young children in the United States saving the money they eat candy every day, and then saving it to the bank to generate interest. In less than half a year, their savings have accumulated three million gold yuan, so they used this money to build a very夭 battleship. The name of the battleship is called the American children. This kind of thing is based on their savings, but when it comes to saving, you must be thrifty and determined.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell you children, first you must be thrifty, otherwise all the remaining money will be spent. Now I want to come up with a way. You can go to the sheet metal shop to make a savings box, put the remaining money in it, and when it is full of a few yuan, you can save it to the bank to generate interest. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone? I advise you children to go and do it!</p>

<p>— Xie Jiting, student of Shanghai Minsheng Primary School</p>
<p>There was a farmer who, when he came back from planting his fields, walked across a ditch and saw a big-bellied female snake trying to cross the ditch but couldn't get over it. He used a hoe to help it over. The female snake returned to the cave and said to the male snake, "I just encountered danger and almost lost my life." The male snake said, "How could you almost lose your life?" The female snake said, "When I was crossing the ditch, a farmer wanted to hit me with a hoe. Fortunately, I escaped quickly, otherwise I would have been killed by him." The male snake said, "I will definitely avenge you tonight."</p>
<p>In the evening, he found the farmer's house and lay on the roof of the farmer's bed, waiting for an opportunity. Coincidentally, the farmer's wife was also big-bellied. When she went to bed, she couldn't climb up, so the farmer helped her up to the bed. The farmer also told his wife in detail about helping the big-bellied snake cross the ditch on the road. The male snake heard this on the roof and knew that the female snake was lying. He was very angry. He returned to the cave and bit the female snake to death.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Do Not Spit Anywhere <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Meixian, student of Shanghai Qinghua Primary School</p>
<p>There is a very strict school rule in our school: "That is, no spitting anywhere." The teacher told us: "Sputum is the most unclean thing, it contains bacteria. If the sputum of a patient is dried by the wind, the bacteria will fly with the air and be inhaled into people's mouths and noses, reaching the lungs." Therefore, sputum is a medium for infectious diseases, and having the habit of spitting often makes people disgusted. One day a student forgot this school rule and with a whoosh, spat a mouthful of sputum on the ground. In this situation, I think it is best to punish him to sweep the floor for a week and pour the spittoon for a week, so that they can be taught this lesson and can repent of their past mistakes and spit the sputum into the spittoon. If you don't see the spittoon, everyone should prepare a piece of paper. In this way! If everyone does this, from now on, they will develop good habits.</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The kidneys are responsible for purifying the blood and removing toxins. If the kidneys are deficient, not only will the body be weak and vitality lost, but the "uric acid" in the blood will not be adequately eliminated, leading to the formation of "uric acid crystals." These crystals, shaped like碎 glass shards, wreak havoc in various parts of the body, causing symptoms such as lower back, back, bone, joint, and muscle pain. Furthermore, if the arteries harden, one is prone to stroke.</p>
<p>"Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" function to dissolve uric acid, eliminate residual toxins, dispel rheumatism, and prevent hardening of the arteries and stroke. Therefore, they are an excellent remedy for treating lower back, back, bone, joint, and muscle pain. They are especially effective for those suffering from numbness in the hands and feet, hemiplegia, and complete paralysis.</p>
<p>However, if lower back pain is caused by bodily weakness, then it is advisable to take "Reproductive Essence." I once successfully treated Mrs. Yan Yongfeng's lower back pain with "Female Reproductive Essence" and Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets in early winter, which is clear proof.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Safe Smoking Cessation for Seminal Emission and Stomach Pain <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Opium is a poisonous substance, but smoking it can mask pain and suffering. Therefore, those suffering from illnesses and not effectively treated by medicine often forget the dangers and indulge in it to quench their thirst with poison. They compete in thinking that smoking is a good idea. By the time the addiction is deep and ingrained, the pain remains, and the illnesses increase. Quitting becomes difficult. Thus, the poison of tobacco penetrates deeper, and the root of the illness becomes more profound. Both treatment and cessation are intertwined like a net, trapping the person within, like being shackled. Alas, it is both sad and painful.</p>
<p>Last autumn, a patient named Mr. Tang Yuren came to me complaining of seminal emission and stomach pain when trying to quit smoking. This caused mental fatigue, and he had repeatedly failed to quit completely. I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Relief" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to cure his stomach ailment and to take "Stomach Strengthening Pills" to nourish his weakened stomach. He also took "Himi Gu's Semen-Preserving Tablets" to cure his seminal emission and "Reproductive Essence" to nourish his depleted body. Because "Reproductive Essence" has the dual effect of removing toxins and breaking addiction, he felt mentally happy and free from pain when quitting. It had both therapeutic and quitting effects, successfully achieving safe smoking cessation.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Gao Xianting states:) My wife has always been delicate. Since marrying me, her menstruation has never been regular. Five or six years ago, she developed leukorrhea. She experiences abdominal pain during menstruation, making her even weaker. In recent years, she has often suffered from insomnia and premature ejaculation. There is no hope for childbirth. We have been married for sixteen years without any children. (Omitted paragraph) Last spring, through the introduction of a close relative, we consulted with Doctor Zhan Nianzeng. Following his instructions, we purchased "Female Reproductive Essence" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Remedy" for external use from Taihe Pharmacy. We applied both internally and externally for about five weeks. The leukorrhea cleared, her menstruation regulated, and she became stronger. Premature ejaculation also subsided, and vitality was restored. Now, my wife is pregnant and about to give birth. Although the gender is uncertain, I am deeply grateful for the skills of the famous doctor and the effectiveness of the famous medicine. I am writing this to express my gratitude and to provide information for others suffering from the same condition.</p>

<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The brain is the highest spiritual palace of the human body. Its nourishment relies entirely on the sublimation and flourishing of essence. Those addicted to masturbation and self-pollution exhaust their essence, leading to brain weakness. Symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, and forgetfulness then arise. The treatment should focus on nourishing both the brain and the essence.</p>
<p>A patient named Meng Yuting came to me last winter complaining of weak essence, brain weakness, insomnia, and forgetfulness. Upon questioning, I learned that he also suffered from seminal emission and premature ejaculation. I instructed him to purchase "Himi Tuo's Semen-Preserving Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to strengthen his seminal gate and to take "Reproductive Essence" to nourish his essence and strengthen his brain. Once the emissions ceased, his essence was sufficient, and his brain flourished. All his ailments were eliminated, and he became strong again, appearing completely different from before.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Masturbation – Seminal Emission <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Its harm is equivalent to bloodletting and starvation.</p>
<p>The bad habit of masturbation has become an open secret among young people. Not only men engage in it, but women also do.</p>
<p>Masturbation and self-pollution, practiced daily, cause the vas deferens to become relaxed, easily leading to seminal emission and nocturnal emission. Not only is vital essence frequently depleted, and the brain marrow damaged, but life force is destroyed, and illnesses proliferate.</p>
<p>Essence is the most precious thing in the human body, directly related to offspring and indirectly nourishing the brain marrow and the entire body. Therefore, those who masturbate or suffer from seminal emission have depleted essence and weakened brains, leading to muscle wasting, mental fatigue, loss of health, and the emergence of various illnesses.</p>
<p>The treatment involves strictly abstaining from masturbation and focusing on health preservation. Take "Himi Tuo's Semen-Preserving Tablets" internally to treat seminal emission. Once the seminal gate is secured, it can stop leakage. Also, take "Reproductive Essence" to replenish the loss. When life force is restored, it can open the source. Last winter, I successfully treated seminal emission and nocturnal emission in students Lu Wenzhuo, worker Chen Xiang, and employee Zhuang Shaotang, achieving the most satisfactory and effective results.</p>

<p>Patient Feng Xiechang, 41 years old, from Shaoxing, working class. (Complaint) – Kidney weakness, premature ejaculation, painful smoking cessation, weak body, and mental fatigue. (Medical History) – Mr. Feng was fond of dalliances and excessive engagements in his youth, leading to damage to his sexual function and premature ejaculation. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and he suffered from kidney weakness. Furthermore, he had become addicted to smoking in his early years. Due to his illness, quitting was extremely painful, and he was unable to complete the process. He was mentally fatigued, afraid of exertion, and reluctant to move. Last autumn, after seeing a colleague safely quit smoking with my help, he asked him to introduce him for consultation. (Treatment) – In addition to administering painless electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from Huamei Pharmacy to restore his life force and eliminate his tobacco addiction. Within a month, he successfully and safely quit smoking.</p>

Furthermore, dietary imbalances and internal dampness led to the various symptoms she complained of. Last summer, Mr. Huang accompanied her to my clinic for treatment. (Treatment) – I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Essence" and "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from Zhongxi Pharmacy and "Leukorrhea Remedy" for external use. After several follow-up visits, her condition gradually improved. In early winter, I visited the residence of Mr. Zheng Hanhong near Mr. Huang's home.

<h3 id="e217">Respectfully Announcing to the Nation's Children <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>Children's Day is here, and as usual, there's a burst of enthusiasm. Adults and teachers are also excitedly holding meetings, performing rituals, and expanding celebrations. But, if an tactless person asks: What good does this do for the children? Only heaven knows. Let's put that aside for now and talk about the miracle of this brave "West Lake Children's Travel Group" as a tribute to Children's Day.</p>
<p>Readers probably won't forget. On March 29th, ten elementary school students from Wengjia Hill Elementary School in Hangzhou came to meet with people in Shanghai at the South Railway Station. What's strange is that they are all underage children, the oldest being a fifteen-year-old girl. They don't want adult leaders; they are completely self-organized. Their purpose is because they "don't want to be trapped forever in cage-like schools or isolated mountain villages," and they "want to use the vast society as a school, and the vast masses as teachers. They want to enter all kinds of different societies, experience all kinds of different lives, contact all kinds of different people, and learn all kinds of different knowledge," so they came to Shanghai. Their expenses also come from the manuscript fees earned from writing little teacher's diaries, and they only brought eighty dollars, which they were afraid would not be enough, so they also brought a book they wrote themselves, "Experiences in Popularizing Education," which they planned to sell to exchange for travel expenses. At the same time, their greater reason is to test whether they have the ability to govern themselves away from their parents' families and schools; and their purpose in coming to Shanghai is not for the bustling traffic and extravagant luxury here, but to see the suffering of people in all walks of life, and to what extent they are invaded and oppressed. These days they are realizing their ideals, visiting various places, and maybe they will return to school on April 5th. What kind of feelings will we have about such a tour group? Especially a group of children's experts.</p>
<p>On March 30th, they also issued a "Respectfully Announcing to the Nation's Children," but we haven't seen that declaration published in the newspaper yet, but even if we don't read that declaration, we can understand the power of that declaration, because their own "actions" are the most powerful "Respectfully Announcing to the Nation's Children." This "declaration" written with "facts" not only teaches the nation's dazed wealthy children, and the bookish elementary school students who don't understand things, but also honestly teaches the general so-called children's education experts who are working hard on theory and completely failing to actually consider children. It has opened up a bright road for China's children.</p>
<p>Finally, we reiterate the significance of this living "Respectfully Announcing to the Nation's Children" and propose a motion to Children's Day: in such a critical moment of national crisis, even elementary school students should not bury their heads in textbooks in the classroom. He wants to read living books, to read books with society as a textbook. At the same time, the children's education we need is children's education that matches Weng's extraordinary period of national disaster, cultivating children's correct understanding of society and fully developing children's abilities; rather than general bureaucratic aristocratic education. Teachers who want to seek happiness for children, please be thorough! Don't put effort into novel patterns anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Two Mothers and Daughters <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>Because I had to move out of a fellow villager's shop, I went to Buried Street to find a house. This street is in a barren area, which the Manila people call a slum. It's a路 , filled with garbage, dust, and bare-headed, barefooted dirty children all year round. There are only four or five pitiful "vegetable shops" from the beginning to the end of the street, and quarrels and fights are common.</p>
<p>After turning over Buried Bridge, I slowed down and walked slowly, paying attention to the shops on both sides: to see if there were any houses with signs for rent. Finally, at the end of the street, I found one with a crookedly written sign on the door: Room to Let. So I ran around this house to see if there was anything, and then ran to the door and knocked. After four or five minutes, I heard a broken voice yelling from inside, and then the door opened with an "ah." It was an old woman with a limp and crutches. I explained my purpose, and she looked me up and down, then invited me in.</p>
<p>Although she was an old woman with a limp, she climbed the stairs very quickly, not at all like someone with a disease. She chattered as she climbed the corroded stairs, sighing as she said:</p>
<p>Our house, sir, I guarantee you will be satisfied at first sight, the light and air are something you can't find anywhere in Buried Street. As for the residents, there's only our family, a mother and daughter, no children to disturb you. ..., she led me to stand outside a room, gently tapping the floor with her crutch, and warmly called to the front厢房: Tierra! A guest has come to see the house, quickly bring out the key.</p>
<p>A crisp voice from the front厢房 answered, followed by a delicate sound of slippers, and a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl ran out half-naked. She nodded slightly to me, and I hurriedly nodded back, feeling a little warm on my face.</p>
<p>The house was looked at, now it was our turn to talk about the price, they asked for five pesos a month as soon as they opened their mouths, I said; "Damn! What kind of street is this, what kind of house is this, five pesos a month". The old woman became anxious, and heavily tapped her crutch, and said in a hoarse voice: "Sir, you have to see clearly! This has good air, good light, and we don't have children, just a clean mother and daughter." ...</p>
<p>I continued: "Old lady, I already knew that a long time ago, but the rent is a bit too expensive, I can't afford it"! So I prepared to pick up my hat, say sorry, and run away. The old woman anxiously stood up and hurriedly held down my hat, and directly reduced the rent to three and a half pesos. I thought it was about right, so I agreed, put down a deposit of one peso, said I would move in that night, and left.</p>
<p>That night, I hired a horse carriage, and moved in a box of books, two pieces of broken luggage, and a bundle of quilts, and a brand new independent life began.</p>
<p>After a few days, the livelihood issues of these two lonely mothers and daughters gradually attracted my attention, and I quickly became interested in them. That失誤 six-year-old girl sat at home all day, accompanied by the limping old woman. During the day, when I got tired of reading in the back pavilion, I would often sit quietly and listen to the laughter coming from the front厢房. I savored and researched its meaning. This laughter was particularly loud sometimes coming from the broken voice of that limping old woman, and was sometimes mixed with the sound of tapping crutches and stomping feet, which clearly indicated that something funny was making her dance with joy.</p>
<p>After a burst of laughter, I could clearly hear the good girl's voice again, she said loudly, in a serious posture: "... so Paul began his heroic voyage. This voyage took a lot of his hard work, because God, in order to test whether he had unwavering faith, sent many gods who wielded thunder, rain, wind, and electricity, causing the sea island's wind and waves to rage: but Paul was not afraid at all, he resolutely and heroically steered the boat and advanced through the raging waves. Finally, the coral island was discovered, and he suddenly became the richest man in the world. ..."</p>
<p>This narration of the adventure story moved the limping old woman. Because her diseased foot, her crutch, no longer tapped loudly on the floor. I believe she must have yearned for that beautiful coral island.</p>
<p>When I went out for dinner in the evening, the front厢房 was already quiet. I could no longer hear the limping old woman's broken laughter, or Tierra's narration of adventure stories. Only a heavy silence. Tierra was gone, and the old woman sat blankly on a broken sofa, her face buried in her arms. Perhaps the excessive loneliness made her feel depressed, so every time she heard my footsteps, she would come limping out of the front厢房 with her crutch, and道 to me. But when I asked her if she had had dinner, her face would slightly flush, and she would shake her head shamefully, saying "Tierra has already gone out to buy it..."</p>
<p>Often, not long after, the sound of footsteps on the扶梯响了, which meant that Tierra had already returned: but not only her alone, but also another person. This person, who was brought from the street corner or somewhere, was sometimes a drunken American sailor, sometimes a stingy coachman, and sometimes a laborer. But the old woman would often pretend not to know, when I first moved in, I didn't know what was going on and often told her: "Tierra has already returned"! She would deliberately change the subject, and entangle me with various questions, preventing me from focusing on listening to the vulgar conversations, laughter, and various unpleasant sounds that could be heard in the front厢房 at this time. Sometimes she would argue with me about the existence of God, and sometimes she would question me: Do the Japanese have any ambitions for the Philippines? This old woman was cultured, and it is said that she used to come from a wealthy family, but later fell into decline.</p>
<p>When our discussions sometimes stopped, I could clearly hear the various movements and sounds in the front厢房. Sometimes it was Tierra's weak complaints and sobs, sometimes it was panting and obscene浪语. At this time, the old woman was silent, her heart torn by sorrow.</p>
<p>Finally, these thugs were sent away, and Tierra followed them out after a while: but she returned quickly, gently knocking on our door, and said in a criminal and timid voice: Mom, the bread is bought!</p>
<p>The old woman hurriedly replied gently, and turned back to me apologetically: I'm sorry, sir, there was a lot of noise tonight.... She also said good night before quietly, like a persecuted mouse, limping out.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Tokyo Miscellany <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Shi Yu</p>
<p>Tea, Saloons, Coffee</p>
<p>If you happen to walk into any street and your ears are directly catching the sound waves of a phonograph flowing out from a window or a half-open door, friend, if you don't have urgent business to attend to, or if you have that kind of interesting feeling, then, please slow down your pace, (even just for a moment is fine), turn your head and glance at the sign on the door or the corner of the door frame, like a guardhouse sentry, to see if there are words like "tea" or "pure tea." No, even someone who has just arrived in Tokyo wouldn't be so dull-witted as to stand there staring; aren't those words visible from afar? Moreover, the Western-style facade already displays a distinctive mark. So, to put it bluntly, if you're happy to, please go in and rest for a while. As you are about to walk in, a young tea girl, with a charming smile, either leaning by the door or "rushing up" to greet you, calls out in a soft, elastic, and clear tone:</p>
<p>——Irasshai! (Welcome!)</p>
<p>Inside, there are simple and elegant tables arranged, and if you want something more refined, there are also sofas for you to sit on. Drink whatever you like; there's black tea, coffee, lemon, etc. You don't have to be pretentious or act like a big shot; drink a cup of whatever for a dime or fifteen cents, and sit for an hour or two if you like. There is various music to cleanse your ears, and of course, there are newspapers for you to browse. You don't have to listen or look, and no one will laugh if you just sit there alone. If you feel lonely, you can invite a friend or two, or chat with a familiar tea girl. Because those customers are just students, scholars, or people of leisure, they won't cause any disturbance, so you can sit down with peace of mind.</p>
<p>I heard that during the period around the October Revolution, Russian poets often read poetry or discussed issues in tea shops.</p>
<p>But the tea shops in Tokyo, at least, serve the function of providing leisure for the petty bourgeoisie in general.</p>
<p>If you encounter a place that is similar in style, but with a more extravagant facade, a larger scale, and signs marked: Cafe or "Western Liquor," then you should at least first assess the savings in your pocket before entering. When you go in, don't be too pretentious, nor too flashy; if you're too pretentious, the coffeehouse intellectuals will ridicule you as if you were a fool; if you act too much like a big spender, you will lose the feeling of thrift in the embrace and chattering voices of the girls. Even if you are in a normal pose, you should also prepare to deal with the demands of the girls who come to sit with you or sit opposite you, almost in rotation, asking "I want a cup of something" or "Please give me a little something" when they leave.</p>
<p>It is the abject life that devours their sense of shame and hones their cunning skills.</p>
<p>People who go to coffee shops are considered qualified only if they can satisfy all or part of their desires.</p>
<p>"Western Liquor" is about the same, or perhaps even more intoxicating, because the power of "liquor" seems stronger than the power of "coffee." Although various kinds of wine are also drunk in coffee shops. However, I don't like alcohol, and my experience in that area is very insufficient; I only remember having seen colorful clothes, bright red lips, and peach-like cheeks once or twice...</p>

<p>China and the West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Songjiang"</p>
<p>The Liangshan bandit Song Gongming. Gathering fleeing outlaws. Even to the point of seizing the treasury, injuring officers and soldiers. Everyone robs houses and plunders villages. Moreover, those thirty-six ruffians. Dared to run wild in Shandong and Hebei. "Acting on behalf of heaven" is a deceptive phrase. Temporarily waiting for amnesty to stabilize their hearts. But encountering official troops with no merit. Only because of, the multitude</p>
