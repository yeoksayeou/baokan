<p>大約一年前吧，各國報紙上就盛傳着，德日兩國將訂立反俄的軍事同盟協的。從此以後，在私人談話中也時常有人提到這種事件。最近幾星期來，德國報紙登載日本的新聞特別多。單讀各報社論對於日本一致深致同情的陣綫，許多入就覺得，目前兩國間合作的程度已經到了成熟的地步。尤其一二星期來、由東京上海各地所傳來的電訊，更足以證明　公佈協的的時間已愈傳愈近。最近一星期中，德國駐英大使，希特勒特任的全權大使李班特洛勃先生就往返倫敦柏林兩次。李氏爲主持國社黨外交政策的要人，他的實權遠在德國外交部長之上。他這樣僕僕風塵，自然負有一種重大的使命。果然，久傳的德日協的終於十一月廿五日正式在柏林簽訂了。簽訂協約時德方的代表人爲李氏，而不是由外交部長耐拉特先生出面，這也是可以注意的一點。</p>
<p>當天下午七時，德國宣傳部部長哥白爾司博士用他淸朗的聲調在無綫電話中向德國人民公佈這種消息。哥博十的得意，這是大家可以想像得到的。因爲新近德意同盟以後，又來一個德日同盟，年來德國孤立的外交形勢至此便打破了一半；又何况，據哥博士說，這個協約對於世界和平是一個有價値的補助，因爲像德日這麼强的兩個國家合作起來，共產國際根本就無從施其伎倆。第二天德國各報就異口同聲歡迎這個新約。許多報紙都能按照哥博士的意旨寫社論文章。大家公認日本也同德國一樣，正受共產黨的威嚇。德日兩國同盟，純粹爲了拯救人類的文化。日本，據說，也是一個文化古國呢！</p>
<p>德日協約，從官方所發表的原文看來，最重要的一點，就是此後兩國切實合作，採取有效的方法反抗國際共產黨，這是說，無論國內或國外的，直接的或間接的共產黨行動。這種方法，是否軍事行動也包括在內，協約內却沒有註明。但最値得我們注意的，却是協約原文的第二條。經過這一條的規定，就是德日兩國有「權」帮助第三國淸除該國內部的共產黨。換一句話，德國有「權」公開帮忙佛蘭戈將軍反對西班牙人民陣綫的政府，只要佛蘭戈將軍公開請求德國帮忙的話。原因瑪德里政府是一共產黨」。在這個前提下，甚至於日本可以不得到我們的同意，自動替我們「勦共」，不是麼，自從東北事變至今，日本不是天天都在替我們『勦共』？經過這個協的以後，是吾德國也來加入？眞的，近來國際間急公好義的人愈來愈多。</p>
<p>德國爲什麼需要訂立這種協約？也許因爲戚到外交的孤立，所以需要一個同盟國。但最重要的目的，自然在於聯日制俄，打破法俄捷克的軍事協定。萬一未來歐洲發生戰事，最少蘇俄有東顧之憂。日本爲什麼需要這個協約？也許希望得到一個歐洲同盟國用以牽制英俄在遠東的行動，一面可以從容侵略中國。據許多外國報紙記載除了明文的協的外，尙附帶有一秘密的協的。旣然說是秘密，我們自然無法知道。不過有一點大約可以相信的，就是德國將帮忙日本擴充空軍。日本根據年前一位美國記者遊日歸來後口述，日本的空軍幾乎全用德國的材料幷德國的技術人員。此日旣然說是兩國同盟，那末軍事上的合作當無法避免。就在這一點上面，我們中國人不應該輕易放過。</p>
<p>自從德意切實合作以後，在歐洲組織『新十字軍』，征俄的空氣突然濃厚起來。德國是否眞的有遠征蘇俄的計劃，這我們猜測不出，另一面，同我們中國人反正也毫不相干，因爲參加戰爭的是德國人與俄國入，最多也不過是國際的法西斯蒂黨與國際的共產黨的爭鬥而已。不過，據一部分人的說法，德俄衝突還是表面文章，第一，德俄兩國沒有共同的邊界。其次，德俄兩國最近互相攻擊愈劇烈，而同時兩國間貿易却愈增高。假如眞的有戰事，爲什麼反授敵人以武器？於是結論，反俄反共是烟幕。實際上，德國將來與捷克波蘭恐怕有問題，而這個軍事行動名義上仍是『反共』。蘇俄不過是一個副角色，幷不是主要的對象。</p>
<p>我們不知道德國的最後目的在那裏。但我們却很明白日本的未來計劃。這我們覺得十分遺憾的，就是德國報紙對於此次德日協約只向英國提起不妨礙英國的遠東利益，而忘記了遠東的眞正主入中國的利益。年來中德間的商務日趨發達，許多人正希望由此增進兩國的友誼，而正在這時候，却發生這樣不幸的事件。德國國社黨當局也許不知道德日協約簽訂以後，對於中國將要發生如何不良的影響。中國人民，中國政府在這個協約之下將遭遇一種歷史士空前的難關。這個協約，名義上雖是對付蘇俄，反對共產黨，但實際上日本人的想法，幷不就等於德國人，他們是利用這個約來對付中國的。</p>
<p>大部分德國人歡迎這個協約，理由就是日本也來參加反對蘇俄，反對共產黨。實際上，德國恐怕又要同上次世界大戰時一樣，再上人家一次當。日本人怎樣反對共產黨幷蘇俄呢？在中國長城上條起砲壘來，一面却在德國報紙上宣傳這就是『防共』的工作。中國長城離蘇俄邊界有多少遠？這個地方的砲壘是對付誰的？就這麼不合邏輯的宣傳法，然而大部分德國讀者却相信那是事實。這裏自然是常識問題。</p>
<p>當德日協約簽訂以後，日本駐法大使曾向法外部解釋，這個協約不是對付蘇俄。日本唯一的目的只在於預防本國幷『鄰境』內的共產黨活動。第二天，德國報紙登載，日本同盟社消息，日本决採取嚴厲的方法對付共產黨，特別在於東三省幷華北一帶。在東三省幷華北一帶『勦共』，這就是日本人的本意，也就是侵略中國的好題目。</p>
<p>日本人對於德日協約的解釋，自然比德國人爽快得多了！（十一月廿六日）</p>

<h3 id="c38">世界和平與德國 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>歐洲的局勢。目下似乎到了很嚴重的時期。據柏林電訊。德國當局宜布禁止壯丁自由出國。又下令技能工作者亦須準備擔任軍役。顯然由於國內經濟危機的深刻。德國打算發動國際戰爭來轉移人民的視綫了　　然而。我們對於世界和平却還無須十分悲觀。一則德國如果要發動戰爭。在國際金融上。非有奧援不可有了奧援。她才可以在戰塲上持久作戰。可是。誰都知道。目下德國的財政金融。因爲過去四年重整軍備的緣故。早就弄到山窮水盡的地步。要想從國際金融方面得到援助。以鞏固戰時財政。當然沒有多大的希望。目下世界最大部份的戰時資源和金融。操在英美法三大民主國家的手裏。這三國對於德國軍備財政。一向不曾公開的接濟過。如果戰事發生。德國在金融上必然要陷於被封鎖。的狀態那麽德國卽使發動戰爭。也不會有勝利的前途的。　其次。世界和平的力量。最近數月間。顯然已經增强不少了。自從英美法三國貨幣協定成立以來。在三大民主國家的共同行動之下。侵略國家的經濟地位更加孤立。而且日德意三國的合作關係。也漸有渙散的趨勢。第一意大利在地中海均勢的支配上和德國不能共同行動了。墨索里尼首相發表宣言之後。斯特柴萊陣綫又盛傳着復活的空氣。這對於德國外交是很大的打擊。第二。日本對於華盛頓條約第十九條約規定。最近已正式表示着願意和美國進行談判。日本外交上這樣的表示。不能不算是新動向的萌芽。如果這種看法不錯。那末。現在德國雖然積極準備着戰爭。但是它的經濟地位和外交關係郤還可以使大戰危機延緩下去呢。</p>

<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>六·做駐外記者</p>
<p>德國國社黨國外政治部部長盧森堡先生，是國家社會主義（外國報紙常稱爲希特勒主義）一個最重要的理論家。他的書籍，不但爲我們硏究國家社會主義的良好材料，據說，他還是一位主持德國對外政策的要人。他每月常誚客一次，而每次總有一位國社黨名人的演講。被請的人物，都是各國駐德的外交官幷新聞記者。有一决演講的人是國社黨挺進隊（SA的總隊長魯策先生。魯策先生的演說，大意說明目前世界的不安定，都是由於猶太人·共產黨·蘇俄·搗亂的結果，並德國愛護世界和平的苦心。他的論調在德國，我們雖常可以聽到，不會覺得有什麼新穎，但當天的聽衆是各國的外交官並新聞記者，而他們中間父有不少猶太種人，例如坐在我的隔座的是蘇俄眞理報的駐德記者，他恰恰是魯策先生當天所攻擊的對像：猶太人。共產黨·蘇俄國籍·雖然當魯策先生演說時，　位記者，却處處泰然，在他的臉部上根本就沒有什麼表情，只不斷地拚命抽香烟。後來我暗地裏問他的感想，他說，「不是麼，過慣了也覺得沒有什麼。」於是我想起德國記者在莫斯科的遭遇。</p>
<p>一位英國記者却說，「先生，你別只替德。俄·兩國的「同行」據憂。事實上最可憐的還是我們這一批「民主制度一國家的駐外記者。我們今天不知道明天會不會被人家驅逐出境，本國所給我們的保障，只是一紙空文的抗議。德俄兩國是獨裁制度的國家，今天德國政府驅逐一俄記者出境，明天立刻莫斯科就會少了一個德記者，所以這兩國的記者，敢於盡量攻擊對方的弱點，不必有所顧忌，他們才値得羨慕。像咱們一樣唯有天天提心吊膽！」</p>
<p>七·一位女記者</p>
<p>自從德國國社黨執政，哥白爾司博士担任宜傳部部長以後，駐德的外國記者採訪新聞就感覺到特別困難。普通駐外記者採集新聞的來源有二：參閱當地國的報紙。可是全部德報經渦宜傳部檢查以後，在那里不容易找出特別的材料來，所有重要的政治新聞都在官方指定的時間下各報同時發表。這麼一來，直接，德國的記者無法發展個人的才能。間接，外國駐德記者也連　受着影響。其次，就是常與當地國人士來往，年來因政治的關係，普通德人與外國記者的交遊逐漸减少。這一點，更成爲駐德外國記者的致命傷。除了幾個名記者以外，大家都漸感到吃這碗飯的不容易。雖然仍有一次例外。</p>
<p>幾個月前，常德國將要進兵萊茵河的前數日，柏林即謠傳將有重大事變。各國記者自然大家四出打聽，希望立刻採訪出這種新聞。不過大家空費了許多氣力，結果　是等到德國官方的通吿發出後才知道。中間只有一位波蘭的女肥者居然在進兵二十四小時前已獲得全部消息，她立刻卽將這個新聞電達華沙。於是這家波蘭報紙便是世界上第一家刊登此項新聞的報紙。波蘭外交部讀到該報後，才電詢駐柏林波蘭大使，德國進兵萊茵河事件的眞相。可見德國政府在外交界方面此項消息也保守得十分嚴密。</p>
<p>在歐洲，女訊者是不怎樣被人家重視的。就新聞界中人也存這種觀念。此次道位女記者亦那麼困難的情形下，居然創造出一個新紀錄。她的得意，我們可以想像得到。後來我把這一段故事吿訴了一位熟人。他說：「哼！那是一個女記者，自然！我說：老兄，你可別誤會了。我認識她，她是一位年紀四五十歲的女太太」。</p>
<p>八，倫敦的報紙</p>
<p>英國政治家愛說，英國的海軍是世界第一，陸軍也是世界第一，空軍不久也是世界第一。這種論調，路透社在中國報紙上也經力宣傳。理由倒也十分簡單，英國的殖民地滿佈全球，旣然人家不肯這麼說，那末只好自已出塲。</p>
<p>月前英國前任首相麥克唐納在英國新聞記者聯合會中照例也說，英國報紙是世界弟一。這句話就是麥克唐納先生不說。我們倒也想替它鼓吹一下。英國的報紙不但在編輯上，印刷上，銷數上够得上這個榮譽，她不但做到成爲教育民衆的工具。最重要的，閱讀報紙巳算是人民日常生活的一部分，無論在火車地道車，公共汽車上，你幾乎到處可以看到每個乘客都備有一份報紙。從極右的報紙　郵報起，至極左的共產黨機關報每日工人報止，從尊嚴的泰晤士報起，至汽車夫老媽子所閱讀的星期日報世界新聞報止，（該報銷數三百三十五萬份）形形色色俱備。在這中間，你不難按照自己的口味選擇一份報紙來閱讀。或者同時閱讀份報紙也不會使你覺得乾燥無味，因爲每　報紙都有她特殊的地方。英國普通一盒香烟定價要六偶辨士，而每份報紙的所費只一個辨士。</p>

<p>曁南與西商昨日重逢於申園、作西聯足球甲組之第二循環賽、蓋殿軍之爭也、曁南於上月中曾一度振作、無如好景不常、近來又覺江河日下、昨日王南珍因晚間有鐵城盃籃球賽、與尹貴仁同時缺席、葉培初亦因考試未釗、陣容更見零落、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>卜　結果、西商更得背日順風之利、曁南雖先取攻勢、但轉瞬卽被截去、同時腹地即吿險境、相持七分鐘、終被西商左翼愛律遜於底綫傳中時、恰中徐鴻蔭身彈人網中、先開紀錄、此後屢遇險境、幸捍衛有方、未曾再失、但局勢仍爲西商所操縱、暨南於萬難中方獲一次攻門機會、並於十五碼處得罰任意球、張日元開來雖好、終以蔡道進來遲一步、交臂失之、迨三十四分鐘時、愛律遜又進襲鬥下、衣甫格來扶得德魯塞跨下漏出之球、一碰中的、西商凈勝二球、暨南奮力反攻、距休息約四分鐘時、蔡道進沿邊挺進、舉足傳中　丕永楠於十五碼處遙射、方扳回一球、但兩分鐘後、關技揚誤犯手球、被罰十二碼、傑克執罰命中、西商遂以三比一領先上半時、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>再戰後、曁南地利得宜、但昊天不助、風勢頓息、致遲鈍之脚頭、未能藉風之助致薜雍源·伍樹芬·石永楠·等連獲佳機、均爲西商兩衛一一救出、雖攻勢轉盛、但九仭之功、又盡虧於一簣、角逐十七分鐘反　西商大舉進攻、曁南門下、粉亂異常、衣甫格來扶乘虛一脚、遂以四對一奠定大局、嗣後曁南雖仍節　進展、以陳鎭祥調前衝鋒、終未有成、惟當伍樹芬進至敵門約五碼處、吉勃孟奮不顧身、搶出營救、伍脚頭堅硬、不幸適中吉之小腹、球被獲救、而人亦　傷倒地、比賽暫停、西商以左前衛慕爾調後守門、吉勃孟暫出休息、幸數分鐘後、即吿平復、而時間亦相近終了、勉力支撑、終以四對一結束全局、西商獲勝、按曁南第一次遇西商時、亦以二對一敗績則此後進展、西商當較具優勢而殿軍一席、西商大致亦可脫穎而出矣、雙方陣容如下、</p>

<p>民衆進步</p>
<p>據陳氏談、自西安事變發生後、閩省頗爲安謐、金融界雖於十三·十四·兩日極度緊張、但亦卽趨於平穩、蓋人民得悉、委座在陝安全、深信必能早日出險也、年來民衆進步迅速、對於國家，對於領袖、均有深切之認識、以領袖之自由爲自身之自由、以領袖之安全爲自身之安全、十七日閩省、得滬電誤傳蔣委員長出險、人民自動燃放爆竹以慶祝、所費達三萬元、迨至二十五日、得悉蔣委員長安抵洛陽、人民歡喜若狂、紛紛燃放爆竹、所費達十萬元之鉅，於此足見人民之擁護政府與愛戴領袖也、政府平日訓練民衆之效果、於此亦得事實之表現矣、本人深信一旦民族之生死戰爆發、入民必能在政府領導之下、一致努力、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信傳主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之四十）</p>
<p>至本年之電器材料市况，初亦平淡，入秋以後，始吿蓬勃，其間且因時局不定，客戶多添備現貨，銷路更旺。電池電筒及帶有軍事性之電料固無論矣，卽一般之燈泡亦突呈供不應求之趨勢。據十一月三日大公報所載，本埠出品較著之各廠，工作莫不繁忙，九月份且間有開添夜班，增產以應市銷者。同業中近時雖有虧歇者，要以歷來經發不善有以致之，非一朝一夕之故也。茲將各廠產銷概况較著者略述如下：秋季各大廠之燈泡產量及營業總額首推亞浦耳廠，計產泡二百五十萬只交易價値達五十萬元左右。次之爲華德廠，產量四十四五萬只，營業價値二十萬元，復次爲福來勝廠，產量雖超過華德廠計有五十萬只，但以盡爲售價低廉之泡，故營業額反不及該廠，祗四萬元而已。再次爲永明廠，產泡四十萬只，營業價値，因另有電珠銷售在內，有五萬四五千元云。再目前滬市電燈泡之銷售，雖較上季活躍，但市價狀况因原料價格之平定，故並無上漲之象。而一般小廠，且因受市上極度低廉之無牌燈泡傾銷影響，不得不暗中貶其行盤以分銷矣，惟各大廠之出品，則能按照固有盤出售。至花色燈泡，如三用泡，五用多絲泡之類，以其製造特異，不若普通燈泡，受出品衆多之影響，且亦未受無牌外貨之傾銷影響，因之市價方面，較其他普通品稍勝一籌，例如中央廠之三用泡，每只沽售國幣四角，然以初次銷行亦不得不减低　扣，以求推廣也。</p>
<p>各項電器材料之市價，最近因內外時局之影響，漲風已甚顯著，加皮綫花綫，今已較前漲二成，其他各種產品，因與外來原料均有關係，廠家爲顧全血本計，勢非增價不可。惟增價以後，銷售更難，此實經營業者之一大困難也。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c167">全國糧食運銷局之職責 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 包毅</p>
<p>最近財政部遵照行政院決議，設置全國糧食運銷局，對於糧食的購買運銷與盈虛調劑，凖備統籌管理。此項運銷局，二十三年曾一度提出進行，後因種種牽制，未獲實現。但運銷局在整個糧食問題的解決方面，始終有非常的意義。現在舊事重提，運銷局正在積極籌辦中，其應有的任務以及注意事項，實有研究的必要。</p>
<p>通常以爲中國糧食問題的　結，是因頻年災與每單位耕地生產力的縮小，並非爲糧食恐慌的絕對因素。歉收年份，地主糧商的囤　居奇，往往使糧價高過於自然增高的限度，卽可說明社會經濟組織的缺憾能够超越天然的原因，促成糧食的恐慌。運銷局處理糧食盈虛的調劑，就須認識總產量多寡的問題中更有糧食占有不均的一點。</p>
<p>同時因爲國內運輸簡陋，交易手續複雜，縱使各地豐歉不同，理論上可以調劑，事實上還須仰賴外糧。災年糧價昂貴，外糧湧入，轉爲抑平，而同季節的豐收區域，仍釀成穀賤傷農的現象。豐年糧價應跌，但因外糧進口或傾銷之故，往往跌過自然跌落的限度，（註一）亦有時因國外收買，反而太貴。（註二）國際市塲影響中國糧食的盈虛，對中國國情的實際需要，並不符合。根本原因，當然是糧價的變動。外糧價跌或中國糧價漲，外糧輸入加增；外糧價轉高，或中國糧價跌落，外糧進口卽減。外糧進口額由本國糧價的高低轉移，又一方面本國糧價並非單純的決定於產量的數額，於是外糧進口的無政府狀態，致使本國糧食市塲愈益混亂。而國內外糧價的相互關係，遂爲運銷局應行注意的第二要點。</p>
<p>運銷局的任務，包括購買·　積·運送·與銷售的經營。主要的關鍵，却在糧價的控制。因爲糧價的變動，能够左右購買，儲積，運送，與銷售的數量與其地域的分配。就內地糧食的運銷論，糧販收集各市鎮的糧產額，是決定於內地糧價，外加運輸費及中介費，折合城市糧價所剩餘的利潤的。當兩種糧價折合數目不能維持糧商利潤時，糧商就舍本糧而競購外糧。（註三）就地主糧商的壟斷論，多數糧食從貧農處轉移到地主糧商的囤積中，近期遠期的糧價，給予地主糧商的利潤率成爲囤積或脫售的凖繩。遊人變動的彈性如能減少，地主糧商投機謀利的可能性當然也減少。糧食流通得保持正常的狀態。那末最高最低糧食價格的酌定，成爲運銷的主題了。</p>
<p>統制糧價從最高最低糧價的確定着手，同時還須有機的運用運銷中所有的過程。例如豐年糧價低落，運銷局依據國內外糧價指數與物價指數及生產費，規定最低價格，自行高價購買，或國營出口（註四）所購糧食一面儲積，一面絡繹運送各消費區域，或出售或仍儲積預備來年平價。如遇到年成荒歉，熑　騰貴，運銷局仍參照國內外糧價指數與物價指數，規定最高價格，使地主糧商知糧價不致再漲，而紛紛售出。一面將歷年儲積的倉穀，抑價銷售，一面免收外糧進口稅。必要時才向中外採辦，或轉賣，或填補倉儲。糧高訂購外糧須經運銷局在整個中計劃准許。總之，根據糧價統制政策，全部運銷的事宜，都須有組織的策動。因此運銷局需要前後銜接左右聯絡的附屬機關。</p>
<p>照日本米穀局的組織，內分米政，調查內地，外地，經理，等課，以及米穀事務所。米政譚，執掌米穀政策上的各種調查，米穀需給往來的調查，米穀的貯藏獎勵，米穀事務所及其辦事處的事務及不屬於其他各課所主管的事務。調查課，執掌關於米穀生產費的調查，米穀現有數額的調查，米穀移動的調查，標準最低最高價格，米穀加工運送貯藏，換購，貸放，交換，加工及整理，公定最低最高價格之米穀的範圍及其相差價格，米穀統制法施行令某數條約報吿等事項。外地課，執掌朝鮮台灣或外國米穀的買進賣出貯藏，換購，交換，加工，及整理等，所有米穀輸出入的許可，粟，高梁，及黍，輸入的限制，米穀，粟，高梁，黍，輸入稅的增減或免除。外地米穀事情調查的事務，執掌關於米穀需給調節特別會計，屬於前條會計的國有財產，物品及營繕，一般會計事項中米穀部分的整理歸納諸事項。米穀事務所執掌關於米穀法旅行的事務。（註五）中國糧食運銷局的精神，可說與日本米穀局的完全相同。因此運銷局的內部組織，至少有米政調查，內地，外地，經理，等課以及米穀事務所。各課相互間的關係，結成運銷局機能的基礎，在綜合的政策中，各課相機進行。但因財政困難，各課附庸機關未能分佈廣寬，深入鄉間，運銷局儘可委派專員與各縣縣政府合團辦公。一切由運銷局主管機關直接指揮，並旅行獨立的特別會計制度，跟縣政府的經費絕不混併。原有的有關於糧食與一般　業經濟建設的設置，例如內政，財政，交通，鐵道各部以及特種機關，均須准照運銷局的要求而合作。</p>
<p>不過運銷局還須注意二點，一爲糧價統制中，規定最高價格的功用大過於最低價格的功用。二爲現有的農業倉庫與地方倉儲應均歸運銷局經營。關於第一項，因爲物租與穀物借貸的普遍，許多農民將收獲繳納地租或償還債務，很少係自動出售。市塲上糧食主權多屬地主與糧商，規定最低價格，高價收買，於地主糧高有利，於貧農無益。及因收買政策使貧農在表黃不接期內，高價購買口糧。（註六）這問題關係於整個生產制度，運銷局是無法應付的。但正因爲地主糧商操縱糧產，糧價無限制的騰貴最有害於一般消費者與貧農。所以規定最高價格，抑低糧價，受損失的大半係地主與糧商。保護消費者與貧農的意義，實較最低價格所有的作用爲深。運銷局運用糧價統制策的時候，此點應該分別清楚。關於第二項，運銷局建立一個系統劃一的貯藏機關。貯藏在運銷過程任調節的機能，係一重要的階段。現有的農民倉庫，雖有儲藏的形式，但因儲存的糧食多爲富農地主糧商輩所有，於是非惟不能調節糧價，却能擾亂糧價，何況農業倉庫所兼有的接濟金融的職能，對於大多數無糧可押的農家，毫無益處。所以運銷局可承借金融界的游資，整　全國農業倉庫。將農業倉庫的機能單純化，成爲糧食統制政策中專門儲藏的塲所。農業金融的流通，則由農本局負責。至於地方他儲，主要宗旨爲備荒卹貧，地方倉儲平凖糧價的能力，往往被甚他地方糧食的影響所冲消。除非在全國糧價統制政策實施之下，地方倉儲遵循運銷局有計劃的指使，方得　效。農來倉庫與地方倉領土勻由運銷局支配，凡所儲存的糧食，卽可按照需要，預先（註七）或臨時運送各處，總之須與糧價的穩定，盈虛的調劑相喚應</p>
<p>全國糧食的運銷局對於中國整個糧食問題的解決，負在重大的使命。其主要的任務當爲糧價的統制，無論購買，積儲，運送與出賣，都須在糧價的控制中有機的進行，才能發揮運銷的全部機能；同時處處要注意富農地主與糧商以及外糧在國內糧食市塲的特殊作用。</p>
<p>（註一）二十年大水，二十一年豐收，而洋米進口，一則甚少，一則反多，實因十九年豐年，二十年足以自給，（指長江流域）及至大水，已在秋初，其時引爲恐慌者爲來年度的民食，商人訂購洋米，其雖豐收洋米進口反多，米價跌過應有的限度。</p>
<p>（註二）今年幾全國豐收，而有人乘機來華收買，糧價　漲出乎意外，實豐年不應有之現象。</p>
<p>（註三）民族雜誌三卷十二期，曹裕民：稻麥改進與均輸第二〇三六頁：</p>
<p>（註四）今年行政院頒布食糧調節暫行辦法第二條，准許出口，其根據係本年食糧市價與上年同期問相差有限，而本年十個月間，據海關報吿，食糧輸入遠在輸出之上。但各國今年麥價上漲，同時日本又向中國暹羅安南大量採購米糧，－－暹羅安南米糧輸華客且有减少勢，中國放任輸出，而無限制，來年　糧，卽無爾補辦法，出口由運銷局經辦所謂國營者實有必要。</p>
<p>（註五）徐淵若　日本之農村合作與農業倉庫第十一頁：</p>
<p>（註六）規定最低價格，高價收買糧食，徒使富農地主糧商受惠而貧農毫無利益，日本富農穀統制法所遭遇的刑棘卽如此。</p>
<p>（註七）今年豐收，粵漢路裝運不及，致使粵省仍有輸入洋米趨勢，倘若運銷局通盤計劃，收獲期後，湘鄂贛皖等產地餘糧即可預告格續運粵，積存來年調節，產地糧食由運銷局收買，糧價不致因產量一時擁擠而跌落，每年預告將產地餘糧陸續運存銷地，臨時不致因裝運不及而價貴，運銷局必須以收買儲藏的方式進行運銷的管理，此亦原因之一。</p>
<h3 id="c168">各省糧食管制之回顧（續） <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>安徽　皖省亦爲米產過剩省份；長江下游各埠以及沿海缺米省份常恃蕪湖米糧之供給。故垸省米產，在我國之糧食地位上，亦甚重要。今年垸省當局應付本省之糧食問題：先取倉儲政策爲中心，其儲押資金之來源，係由上海中華農業貨欵銀團所供給；該銀團負責人，已與建設財政兩廳簽訂農業倉庫貨欵合同一百萬元，由該省農倉管理處指定在鳳陽等二十四縣建築省倉；在其他各縣普設縣倉；今省縣倉庫，先後均於九月底前完成。各倉主持人亦已向銀團辦事處照章領欵辦理農業貸欵業務。嗣以國未外輸問題發生，華北方面派人入皖大量吸收米糧，一般好商莫不深入農村，向農民搜　米糧，以資北運。致市上來源稀少，糧價飛漲。至此情形，當局乃決定頒皖米出境禁令，以作亡羊補牢之計。然鄰省市因正式民用而吿　者，仍得咨准接濟。由此，皖省之糧食貿易，卽爲省地方政府所管理。至於日後省內儲米運銷出　，建設廳正在擬具皖米銷粵之計劃。</p>
<p>乙　米產自給省份</p>
<p>江蘇　江蘇爲米糧最富於流動性之省份。其歷年輸入之米糧，非供本省之消費；而其輸出之米糧，亦非盡爲本省所生產。收此推定，蘇省米穀生產，在平常年中，足堪　給。自國米漏海問題。重感嚴重。省府當局爲恐有　之歲，奸徒運糧資敵起見；乃於十月二十七日在省府會議時，即通過　『江蘇省嚴禁食糧出口暫行辦法』十條；通飭各屬嚴禁糧食出口，於是全省之糧食貿易卽受省當局之嚴密監督。（按已於十二月八日經省府會議决廢止）</p>
<p>丙　米產不足省份</p>
<p>浙江　浙省糧食，統言之，每年均感不足；析言之，則盈虧亦實互見。舉例以言：寗紹固有待於外米之接濟，而溫台則每年均有鉅量之流出。故浙江實爲缺米省份，已可證明。浙省當局對本年之糧食問題，其應付方針以倉儲事業爲中心：蓋欲在做到「浙人吃浙米」之目的也。故將全省農倉事業劃分三類：（一）省農倉庫，（二）縣農倉庫，（三）鄉鎮倉庫。省農倉庫之建築，由省當局向中國農民銀行商借農倉建築貸欵四十萬元；指定在金華，鰲江，海門，硤石等處建築省倉四所。借欵期限爲三年，周息一分，本年度祇付利息，二十六年度起開始還本。今借欵合同已經省付會議通過，雙方當可正式簽字。在縣農倉方面，決定借用各縣原有積穀倉改建，不再另建新倉，以節經費。在鄉鎮倉方面，則規定暫時借用原用各鄉鎮倉應用。每縣縣，鄉，鎮倉之數量，規定至少之所。除省農倉庫規定在明年秋收前完成外：縣，鄉鎮倉則統限於本年九月底前一律籌妥，以備今秋儲押之用。其儲押資金來源，亦由中國農民銀行所供給，總額聞爲三百萬元；但視事實上之需要，得隨時增加。惟自國米漏海問題發生後，當局爲防波及浙省民食計，乃由民政廳擬定「浙江省食糧調劑辦法大綱」九條。提請八六六次省府會議通過，由民廳飭屬遵照。於是浙米之運往各地者，紛紛均爲常地扣留；浙江全省之糧食貿易，卽籠罩於省政府管制之內。</p>
<p>河南　河南亦係糧食不足省份。在國米外輸問題剛在萌動之前，豫省當局，因鑒於夏熟麥糧大批漏海之可慮；故省府卽通過「河南省糧食出境暫行辦法」六條，以資管制。是以豫省今年之糧食貿易，爲今秋最早之受省當局管理者。</p>
<p>山東　魯省糧食，年有入超；其不足情形，自不待言。今歲入秋以來，各縣禾稼豐收。魯民正在稱慶中；乃國米外輸問題日趨嚴重。省府迭接膠東濱海各縣電吿；某國從中指使奸商購糧出口；且以魯北地接冀境，若不嚴加厲禁，實屬不堪設想！乃於十月二十日，提出省府會議研計辦法。結果，決交民政，財政，建設三廳會同籌劃糧禁方針。最近，　省常局亦嚴禁糧食出口矣。</p>
<p>此外尚有若干省份；如晋省於十一月四日，訓令同蒲路局備車將凖備在津南之存糧，集中運赴太原。或因尚未實施糧食管制，或因地域特殊，不克實施糧食管制；前者如閩，粵等省，後者如冀察當局，容當別論。</p>
<p>（三）糧食管制辦法之優劣</p>
<p>我人試就已經實施糧食管制之省份視之，大致在米穀過剩省份，係以倉儲政策隔壁改善運銷爲中心問題；在米穀不足省份，係以倉儲政策與監督糧食貿易爲中心問題。茲再就其優點與劣點，分別論列如次。請先言其優點：</p>
<p>（一）處置迅捷　我國糧食行政，顯然已踏入議而不決，決而不行之境地中。如糧食問題，在數年前早有統制運銷之成議；然總以種種糾纏，迄今懸案不決。今次新穀登塲而糧價暴漲，其爲因雖多；然其最可怖者，厥爲奸徒之運糧資敵！此種問題，當非平常之糧食問題可比。若不採緊急手段以堵截；而循依行政手續之區呈於縣，縣呈於省，省呈中央請示公式辦理。勢必坐誤民食非淺。須知奸商運糧漏海，爲一種非公開之秘密行動；其工作之敏捷，誠可稱神出鬼沒，令人實不易監視，若不就地迅予解決，則一轉瞬間，大量糧食，可盡非我有！此次各省採此急救手段而禁糧出口，不失爲應急手段之一。</p>
<p>（二）地方性問題由地方解決　查我國整個之糧食問題，不外乎有三（一）生產不能自給，（二）倉儲制度未備，（三）運銷方法不良。然若嚴格言之：在此三個糧食問題的大前提下，尚可區別其性質爲二類：（一）爲有全國一致性之糧食問題，（二）爲有地方局部性之糧食問題。前者固宜由中央統盤籌謀解決；後則非由地方因地制宜不可。若就今年各省之倉儲，運銷政策而言：則頗足值得我人稱　。如皖贛二省，均係米產過剩之區，浙江復爲米產不足省份；就其地方性之糧食問題而言：若前者放任過剩米產擁　市上，則其省內稻農，勢必普遍蒙受穀賤傷農之損失；役後者放任農民將僅有米產掃數出售，則來年勢必遭受春荒之危險。故解決方針，惟有推行倉儲政策以調節之。次就湖南而言：則湘米向係過剩之區；其地方性之糧食問題，正與皖，贛二省相同。今湘省以改善運銷爲入手，而將湘米銷粵；其功能與倉儲政策亦復相同。此大部分含有地方性之糧食問題，最佳目宜由脚踏實地之地方政府　謀解決。蓋從地方政府解決其切身關係之地方問題，其利益約有四端：（一）經費節省，（二）有責任心，（三）認識問題之核心，（四）易於管理。</p>
<p>以上所述：爲此次各省糧食管制之優點；以下再將缺點　　。</p>
<p>（一）省自爲政　乏聯絡　此次各省糧食管制之最大缺點，卽在祇知省自爲政而不知彼此聯絡統盤籌謀。顯與筆者前曾主張之「全國一致分工合作」辦法，大有出入。如就湘·皖·贛三省運銷方針而言：自湘米銷粵之風聲傳播後，而皖·贛米產均誤認粵省係一個米糧之極大倉庫；故均擬將過剩米產銷粵省是否能銷納三省米糧之間　。故事實上預測其必然失敗。須知廣東雖爲缺米省份，然與著稱「南國穀倉」之安南，暹羅等產米之區，密邇昆連。據歷年以來海關報告：粵省洋米進口，占全國洋米進口總額每年平均恒在三分之二左右。可知粵省民食從感不足，然不難可仰給於洋米抵補。而此次湘米銷粵無異在取得洋米之市塲而代之。試想原有之洋米市塲被占，在洋米之生產各國，是否卽係干休？我人若就目前之情形推測，則前途暗礁殊多！如湘米銷粵風聲傳佈以來，長沙之米價日見高漲；省府爲恐影響銷粵湘米之成本起見，故於十月二十五日訓令各縣市佈吿商民：一體擁護湘米銷粵計劃，毌得乘機操縱，違背售約。由此視之，從中作崇者，顯然別有任用；希圖阻撓湘米銷粵積極進行後，汕頭雜糧業同業公會已迭次開會，公然反對，表面上雖係對少數人欲操縱米市之表示；然實際上已派人前往香港聯絡南北行以謀應付。而南北行方面，聞已同情此舉；擬增厚資本，在廣州汕頭兩地，設立洋米運銷處。且在西貢·仰光之火磬米穀業，亦願爲後盾後盾聲援。查火磬米穀業，　與香港南北行有密切關係；歷年洋米銷粵，均由南北行，專輪承辦。今其作如此之勾結，在我人誠未可忽視。預料湘米入粵，洋米勢必跌價傾銷。何況粵省要求減免洋米進口稅之運動繼起，此其二。且據最近報載羅馬電訊：據國際農業研究院　表之報吿，谓本年度印度全境連同頃甸在內之種稻面積，據初步估計：約爲三一、七四八、〇〇〇公頃。據去年增加百分之二·八。（見十一月二日申報）查印·頃二地，亦爲我國洋米供給之泉源。其產量增加，其餘糧亦勢必傾銷來華。粵省係屬洋米傾銷之近水樓臺，當然亦爲印·頃米糧所不放棄。此其三。然我人試思湘米銷粵之最大目的：在謀湘省過剩米產得藉運銷改善之調劑，而不致威脅湘米價格之慘落；俾全湘稻農，均可避免豐收成災之襲撃。今因此種種原因，其結果，勢必得不償失。若再放任皖米贛米無計劃的異途同銷人粵，則適資洋米傾銷搗亂之助力；勢必造粵省有米無市之狀態。故此舉善則善矣；但在事前省目爲政祇知盲然推進，而無整個省與省之籌謀，恐具前途，結果尚不能業觀。</p>
<p>（二）禁糧出口非省力能勝任　目前實施之糧禁省份，雖其方針各省不同；但在其施行之糧禁辦法中：可找出一共同點。卽實施糧禁各省，大致均以禁糧「出口」爲着；而以監督「出境」爲着手。其實禁糧漏海，係全國一致性之糧食問題，斷非一個局部省區所能勝任。如甲省在實施糧禁，而乙省則仍自由流通；在實施滑之徒，利用我國各不相謀之缺點，而轉輾偷漏，偷漏，則成爲禁者自禁，漏者自漏。此其一。我國沿海各口，縱可嚴密堵截：而華北長城一帶，藩離早經盡失。倘中央實施　個禁糧漏海政策，而糧食在國內流通自仍不在禁止之例；然糧食之流入華北，其與漏海出口有　區別。由此可知，禁糧出口，在在感覺棘手，此其二。在此二都禁糧不可能之　斱合下，各省實良禁，則一般正當糧高勢必因禁糧而重度變相厘金的留難。一般正當稻農，將因奸走播弄流言，而使穀賤如泥。彼此相互激盪，一般國民之民食問題，將由實施糧禁而愈見嚴重。</p>
<p>（三）無永久性　目前各省之粮食管制。其最后·点，卽在无水久性。须知我国粮食问题，山来已久；决非如最近各省之暂　应付而能宣吿解决。</p>
<p>（四）結論</p>

<p>（二）我國糧食統制之　　不決，實因太篇重於糧食貿易的統制所然。蓋整個之糧食經濟，包括生產，運銷，消費三類；目前高喊的糧食編製，僅在統制運銷上着力。然糧食之運銷統制，實　異統制愈難實；須知目前站在米糧生產者，不在最大多數之糧食消費者；而在一部份之糧金融與糧食販賣商。糧食統制在放棄糧食生產的統制與消費的統制之後盾，而孤獨的統制運銷；故其反搞力之撲，祇見甚偃撃，祇見其偃旗息豉「再待　會！故筆者主張第二條糧食營綫，今後之糧食統制，應不能以　銷統制爲解決之途徑爲解決途徑；以統制糧食之生產與消費爲着手。　生產消費統費獲有頭緒，則運銷統制，不艱迎兇而解，否則　恐待勞而無功，豈能以運辦理兩字爲能解決糧食之運銷也。（完）</p>

<p>人生是苦惱的，艱難的，然而，它也是甜蜜的，光明的。</p>
<p>在一個人的生命史的過程中，它的發展，往往不是直綫的，而是在彎曲地進行，它中問一定會遭過到許多的障碍，危臉，但是，衝破這重重的阻碍的，却正是毅力和奮鬥！</p>
<p>據說入類的生存，是一直被「希望」所支配着，世界上無論何種人，沒有一個是不抱希望，果然，這中間有些人的希望是合理的，有些人懷着的却是奢望，痴望，甚至是胡亂的妄想，可是，他們的都是依着自己的希望，做生存的根據，那是同樣的，「希望眞是人類的社會的進化之母！</p>
<p>歷史决定了我們的命運，把在當前的正是一個極端苦悶，紛擾的時代，我們要克服這苦悶，解除這紛擾，這不僅要我們的勇敢，犧牲，同時，更應該認淸奮鬥的目標，有着堂皇的明白的自信，加以艱苦不斷地鬥爭！</p>

<p>又聞王錯珊和豆腐，馮玉祥先生曾在逸經上發表過「近代第一流廉吏王鐵珊先生」一文，中有這麼一段話：我們這次在一起，快有一年的光景，簡直是時刻不離。最使我佩服的，他雖在官塲中，過着一輩子生活，他却沒有半點官僚習氣。他有幾個很好的嗜好，一是喜歡吃豆腐，他常常蹲在地上吃，很津津有味似的。人活在世界上，能有一盌豆腐吃，就再快樂沒有了。我和他說；從前淸朝的湯文正潛庵先生官至督撫，每天吃飯的菜只有一盤豆腐，所以入家都稱他豆腐湯。你老人家和他眞可算是知己了。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「玻璃杯」是上海很流行的一種切口，差不多人盡知曉。照六書上講，這是「會意」格。因爲幹着這項職業的女茶役，不用茶壺茶杯，而用玻璃杯。「以物及人」，便有「玻璃杯」的徽號</p>
<p>「玻璃杯」的創始，當推十年前的神仙世界。－在福州路浙江路轉角，關閉已有多年。－當時因爲花樣兒新鮮，又是蠻有刺激味的，端的鬨動了整個上海，風魔了不少浮薄子弟。當時抱着「醉翁」心意的遊客，泡杯茶丢出一元代價，在伊們目光中還是刮皮客人；十元五元泡杯茶，胡胡調，希冀達到特殊目的，倒也不算一回事。因了進益的豐富，所以當時要謀這項職業，並不容易，貌美年輕之外，還要加上一副籠絡遊客的特殊手段。</p>
<p>嗣後各遊藝塲相繼效顰，女茶役便如「過江之鯽」般的投効，妍媸老少，色色俱備，生涯也大不如前。伊們爲了環境和生活，有的不得不幹着特項的交易。這並非作者誣蔑，至少有十分之六七是幹着這項交易的。不信，瞧瞧報紙上的桃色案件和姦殺事件，女茶役佔着相當數量</p>
<p>講到伊們的生活，也怪可憐的。伊們泡茶的塲子，總有一個頭目承包。這頭目除了供給一頓菲薄的晚膳外，泡去一杯茶，須要繳納二角的茶資；以外的收入，纔歸伊名下享受。倘使泡茶的客人稀少，或竟吃湯糰，那末也要受到頭目的冷嘲熱諷。因此面貌稍差和勾搭手段不高妙的女菜役也常自怨命苦，高喊着吃飯難咧</p>
<h3 id="c179">遵化的梨 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 朱伊人</p>
<p>每年一到吃「梨」時節，總要想起當年在冀省遵化縣吃過的那種「佛見喜」－梨。</p>
<p>「佛見喜」是遵化的特產，它運銷各處，便統稱一聲「天津梨」了。其實眞正的「佛見喜」，並不那麼多。同時也的確此別的可口。</p>
<p>「佛見喜」是又甜又脆又嫩又細的雅梨。尤其是在遵化就地吃那種梨，從樹上摘下來到售賣的攤上，所經時間，至多不過一天，它的新鮮，實在不是其他的梨可比，這一點是非親歷遵化者，享不着吃新鮮「佛見喜」的權利的。</p>
<p>水葉舖標着「四時鮮菓的招牌的意義，就是證明水菓這東西，貴乎新鮮才好吃。所以遵化的「佛見喜，等到一運出境，也就遜色了，因此在外埠簡直也聽不到「佛見喜」的名稱。</p>
<p>筆者在遵化的時侯，一閒着便打算買梨吃，薄習的割梨的手段很純練了，每次把它一層薄熟的皮割下來，連右手拿的小刀子還未放手，左手上的白玉般的梨，便來不及的送到嘴裏了，一口瓊漿玉露，灌到心田中，眞有使人麻醉的不肯息手，而同時這樣割一陣吃一陣，也當爲一個經濟的消遺品。因爲「佛見喜一在本地僅售二三個銅元一只，價廉物美，這才名符其實呢。</p>
<p>我在一個春季裏，曾駐遵化城東六十餘里的一個小鎭「鐵廠鎮」月餘，公暇便作郊外散步，見到一處處的菒園，便要走云看一看，那兒便有大種的梨樹，正戚放着雪白的花朶。還有籐莖蔓延的葡萄樹之類。我置身這白花綠葉林中，留戀的小想出來。那園主還股股地對我說：「請你們到秋季裏來玩，來吃「佛見喜」。可惜我連一個夏季都等不到便離了一鐵廠鎭」，甚至述整個的遵化也分別了，追想已往，不禁悵然！</p>
<p>所以每逢到賣梨的上市，我便要引起當時吃梨的情景。</p>
<p>我想「佛見喜」，我想念產「佛見喜」的遵化。</p>

<p>— 李衛</p>
<p>阿二是辦公室裏的待役，他是綏遠××地方人；長得高大的身材，粗黑的皮膚，體格是蠻强壯的。平日常穿了一件藍色罩衫，似乎舊得看不出原來顏色，在領襟袖口那一面，常閃射出一綫油光，這並不是他不愛淸潔，因爲經濟迫他這樣呀！我們同事都待他很好；他非但做事謹愼，又能耐苦；有時我們要什麽物件，他不等我們吩咐，就知道是什麽了。</p>
<p>可是，向從綏遠戰事爆發後，他的舉動變得父呆又慢，終日緊蹙着的眉毛下，那兩隻黑大的眼珠，常發出凶惡的光芒。我們深知他是在恐怖故鄕的毀滅，很同情地原諒他，但他現在所感到的痛苦，還是在不識字，不能看報知道戰事勝敗的一點。</p>
<p>每天的早晨，他捧了報紙送進來，好像全身的力氣，都用到手裏。他眼看著我們默默地地看報不知今天的消息怎樣？在旁邊只是着急，有時忍耐不住了，就輕輕地走到我的身旁，馨音是有些顫抖，向我輕微地問：</p>
<p>「李先行，我們又打勝仗了嗎？」</p>
<p>大約是前幾天的一個早晨，我吿訴他二十四日早晨，我們軍隊已佔了百靈廟，那就是土匪的盤據地是非常重要地方。他當時聽了我的話，立刻面上浮上一片喜色；並且不斷地告訴我們綏遠的風俗，地方風景，最後並且說：「綏遠人都很强壯不怕冷，現在那裏的天氣，冷得耳朶鼻子，都要脫落的。」這些話常使同事們聽得津津有味。</p>
<p>現在我們好久不見他吸香烟丁，我們問他什麽緣故？他這樣地回答我們說：</p>
<p>「先生們，你們都拿錢去捐助打仗，可是我沒有錢呀我又不能天天餓了肚，把飯錢省下來去援助。所以我只得戒了香烟，每月倒有二塊多錢哩！並且我决定這樣省下去，必須要把這些土匪呀！鬼子呀！打得乾凈而停止打仗的時候才止。他說完了話，面上現出了勇敢帶希望的喜色，眞使我們都感動，全　的同咆們，醒醒吧，道個生死存亡的關頭！</p>

<p>友梅笑道：這樣說起來，表哥也把我當了一們文字知已了。說時，眼向國器一脧，立刻兩手同揺起，笑道：我可不能這樣高攀。國器道：李小姐一客氣起來，就什麼話都感到是客氣的。友梅笑道：這並不是客氣，有道是實劍贈與烈士，紅粉贈與佳人，把什麼東西送人，就是把抬舉着當了一種什麽高尙的人。表哥送雜誌給我那就把我常了一個愛好文學的了。國器道。李小姐還能說不是愛好文學的人嗎？不是愛好文學的人，像我這樣的閑事，也許不會管的。凡管這種事的人，都是有一點書呆子氣味的，友梅抿嘴笑着，把身子一扭道：我呆子是個呆子。不過够不上加一個書字罷了。國器向來就沒有那種勇氣。敢同女人說話。和友梅這樣對面而談，一來因爲他十分豪爽，不帶兒女子的羞澀之態。一一來彼此是親戚，已經見而慣了的。以前說了此鄭重付託，或感謝的話，還不怎麽難措說，現在彼此漸漸說到笑話了，這又感着詞窮起來。便也在書架子拿了一柄摺扇，在胸面前緩緩的扇着。屋子裏靜極了，那窗戶外懸的竹簾子，微微的搖撼着，瑟瑟有聲。友梅將眼光放到書架子的書上，好像有一分很注意的神氣，然後笑道：表哥這書架子上的書，大槪要以詩方面的佔多數呵。國器道：談不上一個多字，不道就那書架子上的書比較起來，是關於詩一方面的要多上幾本。友梅道：表哥的詩，作的很好，改大我送一把褶扇過來，請表哥題兩句詩在上面，可以嗎？國哭道：我那會作詩……底下一句婉謝的話。還不曾說出來呢，友梅回轉眼珠來，向他很快的射了一眼。國器只好把話忍了下去，立刻換轉口風道：假使李女士不怕我寫壞了扇子，你就拿來罷。友梅　了這話，似乎得着一種什麼可　的東西一樣，眯了變眼，結書架上笑起來。國器也不知道偶今天前來，究有什麼用意。若是為了江夢　傳話，這次根本無關。（一一五）</p>

<p>— 賡元</p>
<p>現在在北大担任化學系主任的曾照倫先生，從前在南京中央大學，也曾做過化學系主任。曾先生一向是「土布主義」實行者，看來很像一個土老兒。有一次中央大學開校務會議，校長新到任，並不認識曾先生。可巧這一次會議，準時而人會議室者，只有這位新任的校長，和會先生二人。校長坐定之後，以爲他是一個不懂禮貌的茶房，便呌他出去。曾先生從容不迫的退席，隨口道一旣請我來，又要我去，那眞笑話。」校長聽到這兩句話，知道事情不妙。後來打聽明白，便呌茶房，重去請他，參加會議。可是這立曾先生並沒有去，僅囑茶房答覆校長道：一等我到一趟上海去改裝後再會罷。」校長討了個沒趣，深愧自己的疏忽，便托了許多有名人物，一再與曾先生解釋。後來雖沒有發生甚麽問題，好像這位校長始終沒有得到曾先生的諒解。</p>
<p>現任行政院秘書長翁詠霓先生，不但是一個薄海共仰的地質學家，而且一向實行一節的主義。前年中央擬請他但任敎育部長不就的時候，他自北平到南京，住在中央飯店。有一天中午，某部部長在官邸中請他吃飯，他穿了一件半新不舊的綢袍子，坐了一輛人力車，從容赴宴。安知部長官邸中的門房，平時看慣坐汽車，衣華服的來賓，外加他們的頭腦中，並無翁姓闊客，所以淸他在傳達室內，躭擱了十幾分鐘後，含着經視的口吻道：「朋友！你要會部長嗎？今天有事，不會各，過幾天你再來吧。」翁先生想，旣然大家有事，不能踐約，那只有回去了，所以毫無表示的回到旅館中，呌茶房備了一客客飯果腹。後來到了下午一點多鐘，某部長催請的電話來了，並且說明，請了各部長官作陪，業已到齊等等。翁先生至此，始恍然明白，然也只得把經過講明，某部長聽了，於十二分尷尬之中，氣得無話可說，只有馬上親自去道歉，可是翁先生却始終並沒有介意。</p>
<p>在上海任某局長的程君、有一次穿了一件新製的布質衣服，赴某聞入的家宴。進了門後，因不認識　經；未免遲疑徘徊，可巧迎向來了一個類似閣人的大漢。也不問怎嗎，便招呼他道：「你這裏罷。他跟着進去，見一小室之中，茶烟雜陳，布置得還不錯。他便隨意吃了一點東西，後來他覺到何以不見主人，且無相識者，於是與同座者寒喧一番，方知這些人都是某委員或某廳長的隨從和保鏢，局長心知誤會，也惟有急急退出之去。最後紟他找到主人，才與正式的賓客同餐。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c183">談談留日學生「情死」事件 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>事情關到男女間的秘密，報上就有値得舖張揚厲寫來有聲有色的資料了。何况，又是壯烈而含有非常艷膩風光的所謂「情死呢？</p>
<p>留日學生朱祖菜與薛映芝倆在日本三原地方準備情死」未遂，隔了二天，女的又在橫濱旅館裏要飲藥自殺了。這事情，其實也平常。但據說：三原地方是日本歷來已出名的「情死」處所，而中國人到那里光顧的，這遝是第一次。這是値得誇張的第一點。再則，朱薛兩入的此次所以要「情死」，除了爲「情」一點不必說是當然的理由外，據說還有一個原因，是爲痛國家之混亂，蔣委員長之被刦持，不勝痛心於國家之事而出此的。這理由就光明得怕人了。爲國而死，誰不該聞而肅然起敬？只是，要救蔣委員長出險，是否兩個人去「情死」了就有辦法？而且，爲痛心於國家之事而出於「情死」，這理由也實在太使人不易明白。中國人好戴高帽子，有句笑話：豆腐店死了老扳娘，銘旌上寫的，却是：賞戴花翖×品銜太子太保內閣大學士×相國府隔壁豆腐店老板娘××氏之喪。這雖一個諷刺人的寓言，事實未必有此，但本是只爲情死而却硬要冠上爲國而死的好聽名詞，這與豆腐店老板娘的銘旌冒用相國名銜何異呢？我就看着有些不大入眼。</p>
<p>就說是眞的爲情而死，　末又何必來其「情」呢？愛情之圓滿達到，原是求取人生一部之樂趣，今却以死赴之。或說：這是日本風氣，日本之可以爲我取法者何限？却偏偏去學上了這不長進的舉動，是否留日的目的是原來如此！我們眞覺痛心，一年一年出洋去的所謂留學生，數十年來，總該有幾十萬了。但至今我們却不見到多少留學生對中國有什麽特殊的貢獻。反之，眞能在中國幹一些有益事的，倒未必都是出洋通的留學生。自然不能抹殺留學生中有一部分特出的人才，但數目實是太少了。對於自己，對於國家，似乎都有一些抱歉罷</p>
<p>新近從日本回來一個朋友，說到東京市的夜生活，包括跳舞塲茶店等等，三分之二的長期顧客，倒都是中國的留學生。。這話大槪不假。還說：咱們的友邦，對中國留學生，特別保護，尤其愛護有錢而能揮霍的子弟．據說，若中日一旦發生問題，留日學生全體歸國，單是東京一處，跳舞塲茶室就得關門一半。這是多可痛心的事實啊。這雖與朱薛兩人之情死，無甚直接關係，但說到此處，也頗値得一提了。</p>
<p>糊糊塗塗的生活，今日看來已决難再得持久，終有一天，血肉橫飛的日子，會判定了我們誰是眞能挺着身子向求生的路上走，誰是會更走下了十八層的地獄中去！</p>
<h3 id="c184">陶然亭 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>多値得奇異，素來很少爲人注意的，我那住居的所在，不知又是走了那一步運，現在，不但爲故鄕的人們，在茶餘酒後，當做閒談的資料，而南國，而山城，而任何文化所通達的地方，也都發生了幕　的憧憬。</p>
<p>不是麼？到北平遊歷的人，下了火車以後，假使你借間一聲此地有什麽好的去處，那回答差不多是一律的，遠一點總說什麼萬壽山頤和園之類，近一點呢？也是什麽北海，中南海和中山公園等等地方，如果你有懷古的觀念，不要緊，他會吿訴你天壤在那裏，景山又在什麽所在，使得遊歷的人可以由那許多地方獲取偉大富麗的景物，水秀山靑，明廊翠瓦，帝室之所居，又是多令人艷羨呵！</p>
<p>而緊在我附近的那個「陶然亭，輕巧的被人安置在腦後了。置在腦後，說起來也是有理由的，蘆葦，墳園，包圍着整個的孤亭，你倘使喊一聲，除掉老遠的有一種回嚮外，簡直的聽不到人聲，寂寞地，讓年頭一度一度的溜去了。而且，靠在近前的「南下窪子」——那貧民的住區，這地方是不亞於上海人之視江北草棚的，凌亂，齷齪，霉臭，總之那是不能讓高等人們「一瞥」的，又何必給外來的人以惡劣的印象呢？</p>
<p>許是自己天生得下賤，從幼小到童年，我就歡喜那被人看不起的南下窪子，而且，也就歡喜淸冷孤寂的陶然亭。</p>
<p>春天，北國的溫暖是比較遲緩的，淸明時節，草長鶯飛，從我住的「南橫街」頭，同了三兩個年歲差不多的伙伴，一轉灣，走上「黑窰廠一，這條街並不長，南端，我們炫赫一生的賽金花所一度停寄的「三聖庵」，也就在這裏，廟字頗爲不小，佈置得也還雅潔。再往南，南下窪子就列在眼前，所謂窪子」，在當初無非是地面較低，有池塘水沼，少有住户的意思，逐漸的，生活不容許住在紫禁城內」的人，設法喬遷了，於是，這地方被開發着，造成了一個特殊的環境。再下去，穿過屹然獨立的一個什麼閣，閣下有大的門洞，小菩薩則供奉在閣上的那間小房子裏。「窰台」像一座土山，荒敗得不成個樣子，立在閣的門前，走上去，幾問破廟都壞了山牆，一隅，却搭了兩間傾斜的小屋，住了兩對年老的夫婦，如果有一陣大風，不是把他們葬身在瓦礫堆中，就可能的使他們連人帶屋子都吹倒臺下去—從前，這裏是一個「窰窟」，熊熊地火燃燒着，使貨色一批批的運到「黑窰廠」裏去，但勝跡呢？隨着過眼的烟雲消滅了，留給人的是掌故的系念喲！幾年前，據說填沒的恫口還有痕跡，而現在，是被野草掩蓋了。</p>
<p>順了平坦的路面一直轉過去，兩側都是些葦塘，春天的煦風吹蕩着原野，太陽溶化了那厚結的冰層，皺紋隨了風向吹過去，粼粼地，根深的葦苗又怒發了。呵，這裏，埋去了我們可愛的童年，也含蘊着無限的値得迴旋的勝跡吶—</p>
<p>在路面的盡端，就是陶然亭，兩扇大門總是緊閉着。春天，料峭的寒風還沒有退盡的時候，這裏很少見客人的影子，交到夏令，耐不住燥熱的沐浴，當陽光跌下了香山的背面時候，附近的男女揮着蕉扇，徜徉在悠然的境界裏，連續不斷。倘使你想有較長的逗留，能够舒服的坐一會，不妨到亭裏去，有茶，有熱手巾，所費有限，站在像露臺樣的走廓底下，往南看，不遠是外城的城牆，漆黑的，城垜鋸齒似的引伸到那一個城樓，又從城樓伸展到漫茫的一頭去。其餘三面都是葦塘，華子比人還高，野札子（鳥名）躱在這裏唧喳的亂呌，月色吞噬了這整個的原野，再領略一下雄偉</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>的蚌聲，四周沉寂着，輕風飄過了耳旁，禁不住的，是有些陶然之感的。</p>
<p>秋天了，蘆葦的尖上結了灰白的穗子，那絨絮飄着，飄着，蟋蟀拉開了嗓子嘹喨的吶喊，葦枝蕭蕭地，條索，淸凄，慢慢地，嚴霜蝕去了牠們的生存，塘裏，又變成一片黃，陶然的人們呢？早已蹬在火坑上取暖了，剩下的，還是孤獨而寂寞的陶然亭呵！</p>
<p>離開了被人看不起的所在已經好幾個年頭，想不到，竟爲了「一代美人」而又掛上人的口，在這嚴冷的冬天，我想，陶然亭該不會因爲美人的香塚而打破沉悶的空氣吧？</p>
<h3 id="c185">橋 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>橋像一個佝僂着背伏在平坦的路上的愚蠢的人，礙人，礙性口也礙冬天的風景。</p>
<p>橋挽下破船入家的炊烟，則有馬口鐵的爛烟突也冒不到橋上來，而從橋洞下迤過。看那條掛在船艙上的破蘆蓆子，在風中被煽動着，天冷了。給人以溫暖的感覺的不是沒有，橋頭上立着一座烘山芋的土灶。</p>
<p>賣烘山芋的老婆子穿得像孩子們一樣，棉襖是臃腫的，鞋子是臃腫的，頭頸也是臃腫的。孩子們有通紅的面頰，鼻子下掛着淸鼻涕。他們躱在墻垠下，用貪婪的眼光看着賣烘山芋的老婆子。</p>
<p>像挾着冰雪的西北風抓着墻的胸，發出悲凄的嘶呌的聲音。生了火爐的室子是溫暖的，可是孩子們却只有僵凍了的黑手，和一把籃子，籃子裏將放下垃圾山上拾來的翡翠。</p>
<p>賣烘山芋的老婆子伸出像生活一樣枯澀的手搭了一回，拿起鐵鉗，向灶肚裏夾起烘得很透火的山芋，一陣山芋的焦香從灶口冒出來，散在雄勁的凜冽的風中。</p>
<p>孩子們拖着衣角抹去水一樣的淸鼻涕。</p>
<p>箍着鐵輪的垃圾車又來了，拉車人彎着腰從橋的那端爬過來。孩子們一溜烟地跑過去，像迎着他們的爸爸那麽地帮着老了的拉車人推着車，把車推到垃圾山上去。</p>
<p>貪婪的黑手在垃圾堆上抓着，掃着，但是天冷了。</p>
<p>垃圾車又拉到了橋上，橋發出吱吱的呻吟。橋像一個佝僂着背伏在平坦的路上的愚蠢的八，礙人，礙牲口也礙冬天的風景。</p>
<h3 id="c186">舊雨 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 林吉</p>
<p>逢到淸閑沒有事的時候，我有一個幾年來不曾改變的習慣，喜歡獨自個兒帶一本書或者幾份報紙到茶室去坐它一二個點鐘，翻翻報紙，喝杯淡味的龍井茶，看看荼室裏來來往往的人們，體味着淸閒底幸福。</p>
<p>透過玻璃窗，是漸漸黑下來的寒冬底夜。風一定吹得很緊吧，每一個行人都把額子縮到翻了起來的大衣底領子裏去，嘴裏吐着白氣。電車載滿了歸家的人，轆轆地馳過。把自己藏在窗子裏邊，看街上人們底活動，是別有一種感覺的呢。</p>
<p>因爲已經過了喝茶的時候，這裏稀疏地留下沒有幾個入：有一桌正在吃他們底晚餐。就在那放滿了糖炒排骨，紅燒魚頭，油鷄的桌子底隔隣，我發見了一張熟極了的臉，然而一時却又想不起他底名字來。他底頭本來是低垂着的：這邊時忽然搓了起來，注意到我了。那尖下巴，長長的臉，隆起的鼻子，祗是頭髮長得多了，這不是——我們都站了起來，還是我走得快，跑到他底對面，問他道：</p>
<p>『你是何志成吧，省立五中畢業的？』</p>
<p>『對了』他伸出手來握着我的；我立卽感到他底手很瘦，而且冷，他很快地，就縮回去了。他還記得我，說出我底姓名，又接續下去說·『你還那樣年靑，沒有什麽改變呢！我們，我們有五年不見了吧？』</p>
<p>我點點頭，坐下了。我也許沒有什麽改變，但是他却實在改變得太多了。從他底額紋上，一看就可以知道他追幾年來是經過了多少人世底風霜。我們在中學底時侯，是同住在一間宿舍裏的；每當夜深人靜以後，我們還不肯就睡覺，喜歡各自說出自己底希望，遠大的志願。我還記得他向我說過：『我目前最迫切的希望，是明年畢業以後，能够如願到上海去進大學。我們現在所處的環境雖然不好，目前的社會雖然黑暗，可是我們靑年要起來改造它！』第二年，他果然在貧苦的環境中，得到了進大學的機會、我們是同船到上海來的。但是，在考試之後，我們被取錄的學校却不同，於是我們幾年的同窗生活一下子被分開了！那時我們還時常見面，依然保持着年靑的天眞，老是說起改造社會的抱負。我們讀到大學三年級的時侯，不幸的消息傳來，他底父親在一塲苦病中，沒有來得及看見自己底兒子成功，就撤手逝去了！而一家底生活擔子，立刻移上了這二十三歲靑年底肩膀。那時我在南京旅行，回到上海，只得到他一封簡短的信，說他决定回家一行，此後的行踪，却還沒有一定……而從此他也再沒有給我一點消息，這是使我覺得十分奇怪的。現在，我們不意重逢了，他就向我解釋了在生活底激流中掙扎着的人，有時實在是沒有寫信的機會的。我自己此刻正在這種狀態裏，所以我是很理解他的。他告訴我這五年裏他奔走着，爲了要牛活，還去當過兵。他那艱苦的生活經騐說得越多，我就越受到感動</p>
<p>『來到上海，因爲不知道你還在不在這裏，——就是在，也不能打聽到你底住址，所以要是不在茶室裏碰頭，恐怕不知道什麽時候才能見面哩！』他這樣地結了束。</p>
<p>於是，我吿訴了他自己的住址，也的略對他說了自己底生活情形。</p>
<p>『眞是一天不如一天了！』　個人一同地感歎着。</p>
<p>外面已經是黑夜了，都市底夜是喧囂的。我看看時候不早了，夜裏我還得赴一個朋友底的會，便向他吿辭了出來。外面寒風括得正緊，疏星在天上閃灼着，一家洋式建築上面的大鐘正打着九點——噹，噹，噹……聲音異常沉重地打在我底心上。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「啼笑因緣鞭撻鳳喜」</p>
<p>將軍怒目膛圓睜，手執籐鞭樓上行。不防我。昨宵因事天津去。你竟是，背地偸身走出門。咳你這下賤人。抽一鞭。罵一聲。手揮目送不留停。但見他，雪膚雲鬢亂。衣衫不整露胸襟。鳳喜聽。戰兢兢。滿身香汗直淋淋。隔牆有耳終防覺。窗外豈無竊聽人。誰料是，盛怒將軍聞此語。頓然冷笑二三聲。你心中之事都明白。莫非是，密的佳期續舊情。我想你，蓬巷蝸居身下賤。淸歌檀板作營生。如今不改尋常態。只恐怕，狐尾還防活現形。只道你，改絃易轍書生扮。變作堂堂女學生。到此地，坐享榮華多富貴。錦衣玉食好歡心。誰知你，一身媚骨天成性。瞞不過，露水姻緣一段情。你竟然，暗中送我綠頭巾。蓬蒿不是淸高品。只當得，路柳牆花野草生。燕雀焉能產鳳子。當然没福做夫人。</p>

<p>金燄提起金燄，可以說沒有一個人是不知道的，的確，金燄在銀幕上給予人們的印象是很深刻。不是誇張的話，他之得在中國所有的男演員隊中獲得了電影皇帝的最高的評價，决不是偶然的，正表示出他有眞實的才能。現在壯志凌雲」中扮演順兒，那力的表演，力的動作，很深刻的把一個剛毅果敢的靑年僩性表現了出來，有驚人的成功。　　王人美　正和金燄一樣，王人美女士也是不容你忘掉的一個電影演員。過去，王女士一向是以一種天眞潑野的表演爲觀衆所愛慕的，自從結婚以後一般都以爲她將轉變作風，其實一點都不，在這部「壯志凌雲一中，她飾的就是一個雄健潑辣的野女孩子，也許是由於她對於人生更有了豐富的經騐，她把她所飾演的黑妞那角色是更表演得爐火純靑了。</p>
<p>王次巃　把銀盤「宿將」的頭衛上，該是不會錯的，我王次龍真是電影界一個多才多　的人员。十幾年来，他始終是在努力着自己的前程，絕不因為「後生可畏才」而稍。妥「壯志凌雲」中他飾一個漢奸，經過那沉着老練的演技，把奸險刁毒的漢奸姿態刻書得淋漓盡　，使人看了真會覺得他是壞蛋。</p>
<p>韓爛根　當今影壇唯一的小丑。在滑稽動作中含着人生嚴肅的意味，是韓先生演技獨特的地方，「壯志凌雲」中扮一個被人共認爲沒出息的胆怯靑年，結果，却是爲了保護國旗而偉大的犧牲了。演技的深刻眞耐人尋味。</p>
<p>田方　自從「吉地」以後，田方是與我們闊別久了。不錯，田先生的志向是値得我們稱譽的，他知道自己的演技還不够出人頭地，所以一真沉默著，然而努力着自己藝術的修養。現在「莊知淩雲」中東山再起，他果然給了我們非常的滿意，他扮演田德厚那個從自私自利到壯烈犧牲的靑年，表演出幾重人格，沒有一點鬆懈的地方可以給我們非議。</p>

When Chairman Chiang was detained in Xi'an, everyone across the country and overseas, no matter who they were, were running around to inform each other, neglecting sleep and meals, anxiously seeking to rescue the leader and praying for the leader's safety. This kind of affection and concern was like encountering an emergency involving one's father, brother, or close relatives. This is all due to Chairman Chiang's years of hard work and sincerity. Because the people love the leader, they recognize the importance of the country even more. This kind of emotion will move the world and is also the foundation for the revival of our nation. After this incident, I know that the leader will repay our country and people with even more diligence and greatness. From now on, all domestic suspicions and dangers will naturally disappear without a trace. Now that I have returned, I especially hope that the people of the whole country will help the leader with the love they have for the leader, so that the course of the National Revolution and the cause of national revival will progress to a greater and more successful state. I think the people of our country must have the same thought. As for the military and civilians in the Northwest during this period, they must listen to orders and live in peace, and wait for the central government and Chairman Chiang to deal with the aftermath fairly. This is especially what I hope for. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>

Attendees included Ma Chao-chun, Fang Zhi, Wang Shijie, Zhang Zhijiang, Gu Zhenglun, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Shufang, Shao Hua, Chu Minyi, Zhang Daofan, Zhou Bomin, Peng Erkan, Zhou Fu, Yuan Yeqiu, Wang Gupan, Chen Jianru, and others, as well as over two hundred thousand participating citizens. Chairman Ma Chao-chun presided over the event and delivered a welcome speech. Subsequently, He Yingqin, representing Chairman Chiang, delivered a thank-you speech. After celebratory slogans were shouted, various participating groups of citizens began a parade. Participating groups all displayed celebratory banners, and individuals held small celebratory flags, accompanied by a large number of firecrackers to demonstrate their joy. Celebratory songs were sung at the venue, and shouts of "Long live Chairman Chiang" resounded continuously. Boy Scouts and military police maintained order at the venue. The Central Film Studio dispatched personnel to film the event. Airplanes scattered colorful paper strips with slogans from the sky above the venue, creating a beautiful scene. All government agencies, organizations, schools, businesses, and households in the capital uniformly flew flags to mark the occasion. Celebratory slogans were posted on all main streets and in front of residences. The grandeur surpassed the records of previous grand gatherings in the capital. The welcome speech by Ma Chao-chun and the thank-you speech by Chairman Chiang are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ma Chao-chun's Welcome Speech: Our leader has safely returned from Xi'an. For the past three days, we have been enthusiastically celebrating, and the previous thirteen days of heavy sorrow and indignation fully demonstrated our fervent affection for our leader. It fully demonstrated the importance of the leader to the Party and the nation, and even more fully proved that the national leader and the people have already become one, an inseparable entity. We must understand that the existence of a great person must be based on an unshakable virtue and power, which no one can conspire to violate. I remember Confucius had two famous sayings: "Heaven gave me virtue; what can Huan Tui do to me?" Therefore, when a great person occasionally encounters danger, not only can he have confidence in himself and avoid being harmed, but the people of the country also believe this. In the past, Confucius encountered hardships in Chen and Cai, and Sun Yat-sen suffered misfortune in Guangzhou. The results further proved the great character of Confucius and Sun Yat-sen. That is why we believed that Chairman Chiang's misfortune could be safely overcome, which is the same principle. Chairman Chiang's misfortune this time was a comprehensive test of our entire nation's response to emergencies. Although, as I said earlier, Chairman Chiang's escape from danger was due to the inspiration of his unshakable great personality, the unified strength of our national public opinion, the Central Government's decisive and swift response to the situation, and the sincere loyalty and courage of our armed comrades were also major factors in promoting a swift escape from danger. The formation of these factors is truly the result of our leader's leadership and education. Our leader must be pleased that we have appropriately handled the Xi'an Incident. If we can carry forward this spirit and, under the leadership of the leader, work hard to resolve the national crisis and revitalize the nation, we will surely succeed.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Thank-You Speech: He Yingqin, representing Chairman Chiang, read aloud Chairman Chiang's thank-you speech: Today, I am deeply grateful for the kindness of all comrades and compatriots in the city who have held this grand gathering and given me so much comfort. In the past half-month, not only in Nanjing, but also compatriots and comrades throughout the country, concerned about the future of the country, cared for my personal safety, expressed justice together, and shared their worries, until yesterday, on my way back, their worried expressions were finally relieved and they cheered enthusiastically. This kind of fervent emotion, in addition to my personal deep gratitude, is sufficient to make the whole world recognize that the Republic of China is an organized nation and that the Republic of China is a powerful country. Although I have suffered physical pain for more than ten days, I feel boundless comfort and excitement because I have felt the unanimous and solemn expression of the whole country. I am not good at managing people and lack the skills to quell chaos, which has caused the people of the country to worry a lot. This time I return with guilt, how dare I accept the excessive praise of the people of the country. I only hope that we can work together for the spirit of the country and the nation, and work hard in accordance with the established national policies. Today, because of soreness in my waist and legs, it is inconvenient for me to walk, so I cannot personally attend the meeting. I respectfully entrust Comrade He Yingqin to represent me in expressing my thanks to everyone and wishing everyone good health. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>

It can be seen that compatriots throughout the country have a deep understanding and belief in the principles of our Party, and then there is this manifestation of unity of purpose. Therefore, the lesson we have learned from the resolution of the Xi'an Incident is that no matter what difficulties the country encounters, as long as the people of the country are united, obey the Central Government, and support the leader, all difficulties can be solved easily. From now on, we will work hard together under the leadership of Chairman Chiang." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Foreign Media's Views After the Conclusion of the Shaanxi Incident <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China, has now been successfully concluded, and various newspapers here have commented on it. The newspaper Le Journal stated, "The original plan of the traitors was based on two things: one was the anti-Japanese movement of Chinese nationalism, and the other was the support of the Soviet Union. However, after the incident occurred, the young nationalists were not moved, and the most obvious result of this incident was the decline of communism and the strengthening of China's anti-communist spirit." The correspondent of Le Petit Parisien in Shanghai telegraphed, "Although General Chiang Kai-shek was in trouble in Xi'an for thirteen days, there were no disagreements within the Chinese government. On the contrary, people from all factions were able to abandon their prejudices and jointly address the emergency. If this incident had occurred ten years ago, there would have been great chaos in the country. This shows that China has made great progress under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek."

Recently, [Wang] and Li Shouxin and others gathered in Shangdu to discuss taking Suiyuan West and North as their targets, regrouping Zhang's bandit army to attack us.

This Xi'an Incident occurred when the war in the front was fierce. All the generals and soldiers are enduring the cold and snow, and have also increased this unexpected worry. I feel so sad and tired, and I can think of them doubled. Relying on the revolutionary righteousness of Chairman Fu and all the generals, the command is as stable as Mount Tai, and all the soldiers are tireless and unshakable. They have encouraged loyalty and bravery, defended the country against the enemy, and promoted the reputation of the army. I am sure that they will not fail the trust of the central government and the expectations of the people. With this fierce and steadfast morale, we will be able to overcome any difficulties.

<p>(Tianjin) Kato, the secretary of the Japanese embassy in Tianjin, visited Horiuchi on the 27th to discuss countermeasures for the current situation. Since the suspension of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the North China policy of the three Japanese agencies in Tianjin (army, navy, and overseas) has been directly implemented by the military.

We are now urgently seeking remedies. A certain senior staff member of the military department, Xia Bangchu, has been dispatched back to the country for instructions. As a certain party's policy has not been determined, the situation in Hebei and Chahar has temporarily eased. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The current organization of police agencies in our country is based on the organizational outline of public security bureaus at all levels promulgated by the Ministry of Interior in October of the 17th year of the Republic of China. It has been seven or eight years since this system was implemented, and it is felt that it is not yet sound, and the name of the public security bureau is also not entirely appropriate. At this time of serious national crisis, the stability of the region lies in the police. If such an important organization is not reorganized, it will not be able to fulfill its responsibilities. In view of this, the Ministry of Interior formulated an organizational outline for police agencies at all levels in July of this year, which was submitted for approval and promulgation. In addition, based on Article 16 of the outline, three provisional regulations on the organization of police agencies in provincial capitals, cities, and counties were separately drafted. Now, these three regulations have been promulgated nationwide by the Ministry of Interior on the 26th and will be implemented uniformly. Starting from New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China, they will all be changed to police bureaus. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Germany and Japan Conclude Anti-Comintern Pact <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Lieshan</p>
<p>About a year ago, newspapers in various countries were already widely reporting that Germany and Japan were about to conclude a military alliance against Russia. Since then, this event has been frequently mentioned in private conversations. In recent weeks, German newspapers have published an unusually large amount of news about Japan. Simply reading the editorials in various newspapers, all expressing deep sympathy for Japan, many people felt that the degree of cooperation between the two countries had reached a mature stage. Especially in the last week or two, dispatches from Tokyo and Shanghai have increasingly indicated that the time for the announcement of the pact is approaching. In the past week, the German ambassador to Britain, Mr. Ribbentrop, Hitler's special envoy, has traveled back and forth between London and Berlin twice. Mr. Ribbentrop is a key figure in charge of the Nazi Party's foreign policy, and his actual power far exceeds that of the German Foreign Minister. His frequent travels naturally carry a significant mission. Indeed, the long-rumored German-Japanese pact was finally formally signed in Berlin on November 25th. It is also noteworthy that Mr. Ribbentrop represented Germany at the signing of the pact, rather than Foreign Minister Neurath.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock that evening, Dr. Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, announced the news to the German people in a clear voice via wireless telephone. Goebbels' elation is something everyone can imagine. Because after the recent German-Italian alliance, there is now a German-Japanese alliance, and the isolated diplomatic situation of Germany over the years has been broken by half. Moreover, according to Dr. Goebbels, this pact is a valuable contribution to world peace, because with two such strong countries as Germany and Japan cooperating, the Communist International will have no way to use its tricks. The next day, all German newspapers welcomed the new pact in unison. Many newspapers were able to write editorials in accordance with Dr. Goebbels' intentions. Everyone agreed that Japan, like Germany, is being threatened by the Communist Party. The German-Japanese alliance is purely for saving human culture. Japan, it is said, is also an ancient cultural country!</p>
<p>Looking at the official text of the German-Japanese pact, the most important point is that from now on, the two countries will cooperate effectively and take effective measures to resist the International Communist Party, that is to say, domestic or foreign, direct or indirect communist actions. Whether these methods include military action is not specified in the pact. But what we should pay most attention to is Article 2 of the original text of the pact. According to the provisions of this article, Germany and Japan have the "right" to help a third country eliminate the Communist Party within its borders. In other words, Germany has the "right" to openly help General Franco oppose the Spanish Popular Front government, as long as General Franco publicly requests Germany's help. The reason is that the Madrid government is "a Communist Party." Under this premise, even Japan can, without our consent, automatically "suppress the Communists" for us, can't it? Since the Northeast Incident, hasn't Japan been "suppressing the Communists" for us every day? After this pact, is Germany also coming to join in? Indeed, there are more and more people with a sense of justice in the international community recently.</p>
<p>Why does Germany need to conclude this pact? Perhaps because it feels diplomatically isolated, it needs an allied country. But the most important purpose is naturally to contain Russia by allying with Japan, and to break the military agreement between France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia. In the event of a future war in Europe, at least Soviet Russia will have worries in the East. Why does Japan need this pact? Perhaps it hopes to obtain a European ally to contain the actions of Britain and Russia in the Far East, so that it can calmly invade China. According to many foreign newspapers, in addition to the express pact, there is also a secret pact attached. Since it is said to be secret, we naturally have no way of knowing. However, one thing that can be believed is that Germany will help Japan expand its air force. According to a US journalist who visited Japan a year ago, Japan's air force almost entirely uses German materials and German technical personnel. Now that it is said that the two countries are allied, then military cooperation cannot be avoided. On this point, we Chinese should not easily let it go.</p>
<p>Since Germany and Italy have cooperated closely, the atmosphere of organizing a "new crusade" in Europe to conquer Russia has suddenly become strong. Whether Germany really has a plan to expedition to Soviet Russia is something we cannot guess. On the other hand, it has nothing to do with us Chinese anyway, because the participants in the war are Germans and Russians, at most it is just a struggle between the international Fascist Party and the international Communist Party. However, according to some people, the conflict between Germany and Russia is still just a facade. First, Germany and Russia do not have a common border. Second, the more violently Germany and Russia attack each other recently, the more trade between the two countries increases at the same time. If there is really a war, why give weapons to the enemy? Therefore, the conclusion is that anti-Russian and anti-communist are smokescreens. In fact, Germany will probably have problems with Czechoslovakia and Poland in the future, and this military action is still nominally "anti-communist." Soviet Russia is just a supporting role, not the main target.</p>
<p>We don't know where Germany's ultimate goal lies. But we are very clear about Japan's future plans. What we feel very regrettable is that German newspapers only mentioned to Britain that the German-Japanese pact does not hinder Britain's Far East interests, while forgetting the interests of China, the true master of the Far East. In recent years, commercial relations between China and Germany have become increasingly developed, and many people are hoping to increase the friendship between the two countries through this. But at this time, such an unfortunate event has occurred. The German Nazi Party authorities may not know what kind of adverse effects the signing of the German-Japanese pact will have on China. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will encounter an unprecedented historical difficulty under this pact. Although this pact is nominally aimed at dealing with Soviet Russia and opposing the Communist Party, in reality, the Japanese think differently from the Germans. They are using this pact to deal with China.</p>
<p>Most Germans welcome this pact, the reason being that Japan has also come to participate in opposing Soviet Russia and opposing the Communist Party. In reality, Germany is probably going to be fooled by others again, just like in the last World War. How does Japan oppose the Communist Party and Soviet Russia? By building bunkers on the Great Wall of China, while at the same time promoting in German newspapers that this is the work of "preventing communism." How far is the Great Wall of China from the Soviet border? Who are these bunkers in this place aimed at? Such an illogical propaganda method, yet most German readers believe that it is a fact. This is naturally a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>When the German-Japanese pact was signed, the Japanese ambassador to France explained to the French Foreign Ministry that this pact was not aimed at dealing with Soviet Russia. Japan's only goal is to prevent communist activities in its own country and "neighboring areas." The next day, German newspapers published a dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency stating that Japan has decided to take strict measures to deal with the Communist Party, especially in the Three Eastern Provinces and North China. "Suppressing the Communists" in the Three Eastern Provinces and North China is Japan's original intention, and it is also a good topic for invading China.</p>
<p>The Japanese explanation of the German-Japanese pact is naturally much more straightforward than the German explanation! (November 26)</p>

<h3 id="e38">World Peace and Germany <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The situation in Europe seems to have reached a very serious stage. According to a Berlin dispatch, the German authorities announced a ban on young men freely leaving the country and ordered skilled workers to prepare for military service. Apparently, due to the deepening domestic economic crisis, Germany intends to launch an international war to divert people's attention. However, we do not need to be too pessimistic about world peace. On the one hand, if Germany wants to launch a war, it must have financial support internationally in order to sustain the war on the battlefield. However, as everyone knows, Germany's finances have long been exhausted due to the rearmament of the past four years. There is naturally not much hope of obtaining assistance from the international financial community to consolidate wartime finances. At present, the largest part of the world's wartime resources and finance is in the hands of the three major democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France. These three countries have never openly provided assistance to Germany's military and financial affairs. If war breaks out, Germany will inevitably be in a state of financial blockade. In that case, even if Germany launches a war, it will not have a victorious future. Secondly, the power of world peace has obviously increased a lot in recent months. Since the establishment of the currency agreement between Britain, the United States, and France, the economic status of aggressive countries has become more isolated under the joint action of the three major democratic countries. Moreover, the cooperative relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has gradually become dispersed. First, Italy cannot cooperate with Germany in the control of the balance of power in the Mediterranean. After Prime Minister Mussolini issued a declaration, the air of the revival of the Stresa Front spread again. This is a major blow to German diplomacy. Second, Japan has recently formally expressed its willingness to negotiate with the United States on the provisions of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty. Such an expression in Japanese diplomacy cannot but be regarded as the germination of a new trend. If this view is correct, then although Germany is actively preparing for war now, its economic status and diplomatic relations can still delay the war crisis.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At approximately 9:15 AM on the 27th, a relatively strong earthquake was felt throughout most of the Kanto region and the southern part of the Chubu region, with the most intense tremors felt in Shizuoka Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Chiba Prefecture. In some cases, even clocks stopped. The epicenter was located south of Nojimazaki in Chiba Prefecture, near the seabed off the coast of Oshima Island. The range of the earthquake appears to be quite wide. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Central Meteorological Observatory issued the following statement regarding the earthquake that occurred on Niijima Island: At 9:15 AM on the 27th, part of the seabed 4,000 meters deep near Niijima Island in the Izu Islands, 10 kilometers below the surface, collapsed and caused an earthquake due to a fault. Niijima Island, which is near the epicenter, experienced a strong earthquake. Although aftershocks continue, there should be no danger. (Domei dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Niijima Island police in the Izu Islands to the Metropolitan Police Department, an earthquake occurred on Niijima Island at 9:10 AM. Landslides and fissures have occurred within the jurisdiction, and many houses have collapsed. Investigations are currently underway. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Izu Niijima Island: On the afternoon of the 26th, Niijima Island seemed to feel continuous earthquakes due to underground movements on the seabed. The islanders were deeply suspicious and fearful. At 9:15 AM on the 27th, a major strong earthquake occurred. Most of the stone buildings collapsed or developed cracks. Although wooden houses avoided collapse, they were severely tilted. All the mountains also had landslides, and the roads cracked, making walking dangerous. Fortunately, there seem to be no deaths or injuries at present. Only two or three people are missing in the mountains, so the youth groups are conducting searches. Because of the frequent earthquakes, the islanders are all trembling and temporarily have to sleep in the open. The entire island has prepared for fire prevention and prohibited lighting fires. Therefore, Niijima Island can be said to be a fireless island. In addition to the rain, there is no preparation, so the islanders who are outdoors are very sad. Also, Oshima Island and Miyake Island are safe and sound. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Niijima Honmura Village Office to the Tokyo Prefectural Office at 1:00 PM on the 27th, a major earthquake occurred on Niijima Island, and the houses were completely destroyed. The shocks continued, making it impossible to investigate. According to the news received by the Electrical Department of the Tokyo Telegraph and Telephone Bureau, all the power lines on the island were destroyed, making it difficult to restore them temporarily. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Yokosuka: The Yokosuka Naval Base, upon receiving news that Niijima Island was completely destroyed, urgently dispatched a flying boat commanded by Lieutenant Fukuoka of the Naval Air Corps at 1:40 PM on the 27th to investigate the facts. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Izu Niijima Island: An Island with Southern Flair, Natural Hot Springs and Scenic Views; Islanders Mostly Live by Fishing</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Izu Niijima Island, which is reported to have been completely destroyed, is located far at 24 degrees north latitude, surrounded by black seas, like a stone remotely tied within the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the Izu Seven Islands. It has 740 households and a population of over 4,000. The islanders engage in fishing and cultivate and manufacture camellia oil. The old and the young are all honest and simple, living and working in peace and contentment, with a strong southern atmosphere. The coastline is all white sand, and hot springs flow constantly through the rock crevices, harmonized by the tide. The islanders who have been blessed with this nature have recently operated the Niijima Hot Spring Hotel and five or six other inns, making it the most suitable health resort in the Kanto region.

<p>(Washington) After the close of the Pan-American Peace Conference, international circles here have been widely discussing the possibility of Canada's future participation in the Pan-American peace coordination. Well-informed sources have learned that the reasons for both proponents and opponents are as follows: A. Reasons for proponents: (1) After Canada's participation, the American peace group can extend from the South Pole to the North Pole. In the event that Canada faces the danger of aggression in the future, it can obtain new diplomatic assistance. (2) Canada also has considerable commercial and financial relations with Latin American countries, so it can obtain most-favored-nation treatment. (3) If the United States participates in the system of controlling armaments or restricting trade with belligerent countries, the risk of American factories relocating to Canada can be avoided. (4) Pan-American cooperation is almost entirely in the technical and cultural fields, and Canada's participation can facilitate all aspects. B. Reasons for opponents: (1) Canada's relationship with the British Empire will make the close relationship between the dominion and the independent countries of America illogical, and may cause inconvenience to London. (2) After cooperating with South American countries, Canada cannot simultaneously maintain commercial ties with various parts of the Empire, because the agricultural products of South American countries are in competition with Canada's products. (3) If British Canada can participate in the Pan-American Group, then the territories of the Netherlands and France, such as the West Indies, can of course also participate. In this way, the Pan-American movement will have a Europeanized color. (4) In the event of unexpected events, Canada's activities in the Pan-American Group will be difficult to handle because it must consider London's opinions. (National News dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Mr. Kellogg, the former Secretary of State of Minnesota, USA, who jointly initiated the Paris Peace Pact with French Foreign Minister Briand, gave a speech here, praising President Roosevelt, saying that he has been diligently seeking sincerity and trust among nations, and said, "The President's personal visit to Central and South America to complete the mission of peace is enough to make other countries follow suit and work together for peace. I am very pleased with this. If countries are currently at war, the leader of the war will be the first to suffer.

The Philippines can also be a dangerous place in the Far East, so he opposes the establishment of a naval base in the Philippines. For 20 years, he has never believed that Japan coveted the Philippines, but today it is very different from the past. He only hopes that Japan can also participate in the above-mentioned neutrality agreement. As for the point that the Philippines is protected by the United States, King also opposes it. He believes that after the Philippines is completely independent, even if it is attacked by other countries, the United States should not fight for it, but only accept the fait accompli like Abyssinia.

<p>(Berlin) It is formally announced here that Germany has taken "necessary measures" to have the Spanish leftist government release the German merchant ship "Palos," which was seized yesterday. The nature of the "measures" has not been disclosed. An official stated that the ship was not carrying contraband and that it was seized outside Spanish territorial waters. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The case of the German ship "Palos" being intercepted by a Spanish government warship yesterday is indeed feared to cause a serious international dispute. According to a German news agency, the German ship was detained outside Spanish territorial waters near Bilbao. The German authorities held an emergency meeting in Berchtesgaden and immediately ordered several warships to sail at full speed to Bilbao. At the same time, a communiqué was issued stating, "Germany has now begun to take necessary measures to rescue the detained German ship." Furthermore, a well-informed spokesman stated today that if the Spanish government returns the "Palos" safely to Germany, the case can be concluded immediately. However, if the ship and its crew suffer any damage, a very serious situation will inevitably arise. It is generally believed that there are currently about six to nine German warships in Spanish territorial waters. These ships have recently been anchored in Gibraltar, Málaga, and San Sebastian. According to an official announcement, the "Palos" is a ship of the Oldenburg Portuguese Company of Hamburg. This time, the ship was sailing from Hamburg to various Spanish ports. It was stated that the ship was not carrying munitions, but the Spanish government detained the ship's cargo and three passengers, which is unreasonable. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the German merchant ship "Palos" was detained by government warships in the waters of the Basque Autonomous Region of Spain a few days ago, it was generally believed that the German government would immediately dispatch several warships to the port of Bilbao.

In addition, all Soviet merchant ships sailing to Spanish waters have been equipped with small cannons for self-defense. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">French Government Proposes New Plan to Implement Non-Intervention Agreement; German and Portuguese Attitudes Are Key <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, France presented a new plan to European powers to tighten the ban on the transportation of arms, troops, and financial resources to Spain. It was stated that if other countries agree, France is willing to accept any necessary measures to implement this ban. It is understood that if German Führer Hitler can prohibit German volunteers from enlisting in Spain, then Britain and France are still prepared to provide economic assistance to Germany today. However, if Germany insists on interfering in Spanish affairs, France also reserves the right to assist the Madrid government with appropriate methods. The fate of the new plan will depend on Portugal's attitude, as only France and Portugal border Spain, and only France and Portugal have the power to prohibit the smuggling of arms. Today, France's anxiety about Spanish affairs is increasing, as it is reported that foreign ships are transporting arms to both sides in a continuous stream. In recent days, twenty foreign aircraft have flown from Morocco to Spain, ten of which were German aircraft. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Before Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with British Ambassador to Italy Drummond this morning, it is reported that he met with the French Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Mr. Blondel. It is likely that Mr. Blondel, on behalf of the French government, offered advice to Italy on the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain to enlist. According to reports, when the London Non-Intervention Committee on Spanish Civil War discussed the issue of prohibiting volunteers from enlisting, the representatives of Germany and Portugal refused to discuss this issue separately from the entire issue of indirect assistance to the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. (Note: The so-called indirect assistance refers to financial assistance and the dispatch of volunteers to enlist.) Subsequently, the French Foreign Ministry instructed its ambassadors in Germany and Russia and its minister in Portugal to request these countries to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain to enlist. This is the same in nature as the negotiations conducted by Mr. Blondel today. Regarding this matter, Italy, Germany, and Portugal will likely consult with each other first before providing a response. It is also reported that Count Rossi, an Italian officer who went to Mallorca Island in Spain for inspection, left the island before October. The residents of the island held a warm farewell. This move shows that Italy has made concessions to Britain and France on the Spanish issue, and the work of the London Coordination Committee can therefore be facilitated. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The Sunday Times recently published an article commenting on Germany's policy towards the Spanish events, stating, "Based on the various signs, the German government is likely considering whether its assistance to the Spanish Nationalist authorities is worthwhile based on the report of the Spanish 'debts'. The cost of Germany's assistance to General Franco's government is very high, and this must be taken into account on the German side. If it is believed that Germany will obtain manganese ore produced in Spain and other raw materials needed by Germany as exchange goods, then whether this transaction is worthwhile is also a big question. According to the opinions of observers here, Germany does not seem to be making a profit. Furthermore, General Franco would have no possibility of conquering Spain without the assistance of foreign troops. Therefore, even if the Nationalist forces win, they must rely on foreign aid to consolidate their position in the country. If so, is Germany prepared to have a portion of German troops occupy Spain for a considerable period of time after the Spanish Civil War ends? This is indeed a big question." The newspaper also stated, "The outcome of the Spanish Civil War is one of the things that German Führer Hitler is most concerned about. It has become an open secret that Hitler wants to gain victory abroad in order to divert the attention of the people at home and maintain his declining prestige. In the current situation, Germany's financial and economic situation is on the verge of rapid collapse. If German diplomacy suffers a setback in Spain, Hitler's political prestige will be greatly affected. This is also a well-known fact." (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Barcelona: The two sons of former President Zamora, namely Luis and José, returned home to volunteer for combat and arrived here yesterday from France. Their father, originally a moderate Catholic party member, tried hard to dissuade them from making this trip beforehand and notified the authorities in Limoges to detain them once, but because the two sons were determined to go and both had formal passports, he was unable to stop them. Luis and José gave a speech to the press here to respond to their father's words published in the French "New Era Newspaper." (Note: Their father had said that his sons were ignorant and had been fooled.) They said, "Even when we were living in a foreign country, we had long had the desire to serve our motherland. This trip is entirely voluntary. No one came to us beforehand to make an appointment." It is not accurate to say that we are doing this because we are being oppressed. "Before we left, we formally applied to our country's embassy in France for a passport to return home. The rumor that we applied for a passport under a false name is also not true. When we arrived in Limoges, France, the local police tried to stop us, but we were unmoved. It can be seen that we are indeed determined." We are new recruits from the 1933 and 1935 classes. Since the government has ordered the conscription of new recruits, we should pack our bags and return home to serve the government forces. "It should be known that this matter is not a matter of sons being forcibly taken away by others, but rather a matter of sons fulfilling their duties, which cannot be prevented by others."

<h3 id="e60">Agreement on Maintaining the Status Quo in the Mediterranean; British-Italian Agreement Drafted; Signing to Take Place Soon; Full Text to Be Published Today or Tomorrow <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The gentlemen's agreement between Britain and Italy on the Mediterranean issue was drafted three days ago and sent to London to solicit the opinions of the British government. Once the British side provides a response, the signing can take place. The draft agreement is divided into four or five sections, the most difficult of which is the section on both sides respecting the existing status in the Mediterranean. Initially, both sides intended to mutually promise to maintain the naval balance of power in the Mediterranean, but because the composition of the British and Italian Mediterranean fleets is very different (the British battleships are more numerous than the Italian fleet), it was necessary to abandon this proposal and replace it with the phrase "respect the existing status" to make it more flexible. Not only should the naval tonnage of both sides maintain the status quo (the British naval tonnage in the Mediterranean is 100,000 to 125,000 tons more than that of Italy), but the naval bases established by both sides should also maintain the status quo. The ongoing projects (Britain is building naval bases in Haifa Port in Palestine, and Italy is building naval bases in the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean) can still be continued by both sides. The above sections are not detailed in the agreement, but are only a matter of gentleman's faith, but they are extremely important in spirit. The dispute between Britain and Italy has been delayed for more than a year and can now be brought to an end, and the general atmosphere can be eased. Furthermore, the gentleman's agreement is not aimed at any other country, and the signatories mutually agree to work for the cause of peace. The route from Britain to India and the route from Italy to East Africa are guaranteed by both sides. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that British Ambassador to Italy Drummond visited Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano at 11:00 this morning to discuss matters. Therefore, the gentleman's agreement between Britain and Italy on the Mediterranean issue can be established quickly. The full text will likely be published next Monday or Tuesday. It is reported that its content is very brief, not exceeding twenty lines typed on a typewriter. It only states that Britain and Italy mutually guarantee to maintain peace and freedom of navigation in the Mediterranean and mutually respect the existing status in the Mediterranean. The last level is the most difficult point of negotiation. According to reports, Italian officer Count Rossi led Italian troops to Mallorca Island in the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean in September to set up defenses, with the intention of staying on the island for a long time. This matter was a major reef in the relationship between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean. However, it is now reported that Count Rossi withdrew from the island ten days ago, and the negotiation of the gentleman's agreement between the two countries was able to take a sudden turn for the better, apparently facilitated by this move. Furthermore, general observers believe that there will be no provisions on various naval technical issues in the agreement. However, Italy's future attitude towards the Spanish events will be changed by this agreement. If so, the general situation in Europe can be eased. The most important issue thereafter is the German issue. Opinion here expresses support for the rapprochement between France and Germany and between Britain and Germany, believing that the foundation for this rapprochement should lie in (1) Germany abolishing its policy of economic self-sufficiency and restoring normal economic relations with other countries, and (2) that country revising its arms policy.

<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the news of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's escape and arrival in Luoyang at 6:00 PM on the 25th reached Beiping, all newspapers immediately published special editions. Newspaper boys also shouted wildly on the streets, spreading the news throughout the city. After 7:00 PM, students from various schools set off firecrackers to celebrate. Commander Song Zheyuan first received a telegram from Liu Jianqun at 9:00 PM on the 25th, and then received a telegram from He Yingqin at 12:00 AM. That night, he sent a telegram to Luoyang to express his condolences to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and ordered the entire city of Beiping to fly flags in celebration on the 26th. On that day, students from various schools held celebration meetings in the morning and afternoon and held celebration parades. Starting at 8:00 AM, they set off in groups, carrying slogans celebrating and supporting Commander-in-Chief Chiang and posting them throughout the city. It is estimated that more than 30 middle schools and universities participated in the parade, with nearly 20,000 male and female students wearing military training uniforms or uniforms, showing great enthusiasm. When the students were parading in the morning, the Beiping police, who had been ordered to be on alert in recent days to prevent student unrest, thought that the student parade on the 26th was such a preparation, so they tried to stop it. Yang Likui, a professor at Normal University, and others went to the city government to visit Mayor Qin Decun to explain their intentions, saying that the student parade was celebratory in nature and that the students from various schools were being supervised by teachers and would not have any accidents. Qin sent personnel to inform the police to let them go and ordered Chen Jiyan, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to send mounted police to protect them. After Yang and others left, the police also received orders, and the students continued the parade. At noon, a general meeting was held in front of Tiananmen Square until 1:30 PM, and the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, the parade continued until about 5:00 PM, when they lined up and returned to school.</p>
<p>After Song Zheyuan heard that Commander-in-Chief Chiang had escaped, he made a statement on the morning of the 26th, saying, "I received telegrams last night proving that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has escaped. In addition to sending a telegram to Luoyang that night to express my condolences to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, I also see this as a blessing for the country and the people. After the Xi'an Incident occurred, I received a telegram from Zhang Hanqing and immediately replied, expressing two points: (1) I have always supported the central government, and (2) I resolutely implement the anti-communist policy. Later, I heard that the government thoroughly rectified the disciplinary net, and I believed that the border officials should obey the central government's主張when the leader suffered such an accident so that they could quell the situation as soon as possible. I also hope that Zhang Hanqing can accommodate the opinions of all parties as soon as possible to maintain the prestige of the central government and the dignity of the leader. I am very pleased that the incident has been peacefully resolved. From now on, my policy is to support the government and thoroughly eliminate the communists." (26th)</p>

<p>Over Four Hundred Opium Dens Operate Openly Under the Protection of Concessions</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since the central government stipulated a two-year ban on drugs and a six-year ban on opium, Tianjin, despite its special environment, has strived to implement these policies, dealing a blow to a certain party's poisoning policy. As the end of the year approaches, the term for the drug ban is coming to a close. Drug offenders have only about ten days left to live. From January 1st of next year, anyone caught will be executed immediately. Here is a summary of Tianjin's anti-drug achievements and progress over the past two years:</p>
<p>Drugs Within Concessions</p>
<p>The types of drugs, according to the Strict Prohibition of Highly Addictive Drugs Ordinance, are divided into several types, including opium, gold pills, red pills, morphine, and white pills. Among them, opium is the most prevalent. Its source is opium dens within a certain concession. Within a certain concession, besides Rue de Chusan, opium dens are found everywhere in the streets and alleys. Most are run by Koreans and operate openly under the protection of a certain party. The total number reaches more than four hundred and twenty. Drug addicts flock there day and night. Each opium den is crowded with people, the business is thriving, forming a grand spectacle. The municipal authorities have repeatedly sent notes to a certain concession, requesting them to investigate and prohibit these activities, but to no avail. The implementation of a certain party's poisoning policy cannot be effectively stopped. Recently, many Koreans have been carrying bags filled with drugs, peddling them in the counties and villages of the interior. The Hebei Provincial Government, upon receiving reports, specially dispatched Councilor Chen Shusheng to various counties to, together with local authorities, monitor Koreans leaving the country and hand them over to the Tianjin Japanese Police Department for handling. As of this month, eleven batches, totaling eighty-three people, have been apprehended.</p>
<p>Establishment of Rehabilitation Centers</p>
<p>At the beginning of the drug ban implementation, the first thing was to establish rehabilitation facilities to help addicts quit. In the spring of the previous year, when Zhang Ting'e was the mayor of Tianjin, despite the city treasury being severely strained, he managed to prepare and establish a rehabilitation center with five hundred beds, accommodating addicts who voluntarily sought treatment or were caught in drug cases. At that time, those who had a slight desire to reform flocked to seek rehabilitation, including university students, former county magistrates, secretaries, or government officials. Currently, for the sake of easier management, the municipal government has merged the rehabilitation center into the Municipal Second Hospital, but the scale and organization remain the same. According to the statistics released by the center, from the date of its establishment to the end of November of this year, a total of 14,621 people have been rehabilitated, with women accounting for six percent. However, according to estimates, the total number of drug addicts in the city reaches 60,000, so only one-sixth of them have been rehabilitated in the past two years. The center is now preparing to close down. From January 1st of next year, drug offenders will be executed. It is unknown where these 50,000 drug addicts will be placed.</p>
<p>Statistics on Drug Cases</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, in order to handle cases involving highly addictive drugs, specially established the Drug Case Trial Office. It began operating on January 1, 1935. Most of the cases accepted were those captured by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. Occasionally, a few were transferred from the Tianjin Security Command for trial. The total number of drug cases is about two thousand, involving more than three thousand criminals. Among them, eleven have been executed by firing squad, including two for manufacturing drugs, three for trafficking drugs, three for transporting drugs, and three for relapse. The remaining were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from twenty days to fifteen years. After all judgments were made, they were submitted to the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office for approval and then transferred to the Hebei Third Prison for execution. Currently, the office still has more than eighty pending cases, which are being cleared. It is also scheduled to close at the end of this year. Because the date for executing drug offenders is approaching, the municipal government has specially ordered all agencies to conduct anti-drug publicity, with cautionary slogans and startling murals visible everywhere. The Public Education Center is also holding parades and performing the drama "Shooting Opium Addicts" to promote the awakening of drug addicts.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Burns Drugs</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate its determination to ban drugs, the Tianjin Municipal Government specifically scheduled a drug burning at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month next to the rehabilitation center outside the main station. From the June 3rd Opium Prohibition Day commemoration to November 30th, a total of 8,585 taels, 6 mace, 1 candareen, and 5 ho of raw opium and opium paste, and 2,546 taels, 5 mace, 0 candareen, 7 li, 4 hao, and 5 si of drugs were seized and newly collected. All were burned publicly. In addition to preparing a list and submitting it to the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office for approval, notices have also been sent to various agencies and organizations, inviting them to send personnel to supervise the event to ensure solemnity. According to Ma Yanchong, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, from January 1st of next year, anyone who manufactures, traffics, or uses drugs will be executed immediately upon capture, regardless of any difficulties. For this purpose, Peiping has purchased two thousand coffins for standby. This city can do the same if necessary. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Southern Fujian: Poisoned Salt Incident in Yongchun - Official Salt Transport to Yongchun Blocked, Public Food Supply Feared - Quanzhou Salt Bureau Denies Poisoning <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: A recent incident of poisoned salt in Yongchun County, Southern Fujian, has caused public panic. Previously, on the 21st, the Shuide Salt Bureau transported a batch of new salt from Quanzhou. On the same day, the Taixing Store in Wulijie, Yongchun, began selling the new salt that night. After eating the salt, soldiers of the First Company of the 11th Security Regiment stationed in the county experienced collective abdominal pain. Inspection of the food and cooking utensils revealed nothing unusual. It was decided to test the newly purchased salt, and it was discovered to contain nitric acid and mercury, poisonous substances. The regimental headquarters, based on the situation, immediately sent troops to investigate together with the district office. However, the person in charge of Taixing Store had already fled. On the 22nd, the regimental headquarters sealed up the salt stored in Taixing Store and the Yongde Official Salt Distribution Center, and sent troops to guard it. Within a few hours, the news spread throughout the city. Those who had purchased the new salt dared not eat it, and those without salt dared not buy more. It was found that the Salt Bureau had transported a total of 3,000 dan of new salt this time. On the afternoon of the 22nd, twelve salt boats from the Second District were transported upstream from Jinjiang and were also monitored by troops sent by the regimental headquarters, who were not allowed to unload and sell the cargo. Zhang Kewu, the commander of the 11th Security Regiment, telegraphed the Quanzhou Salt Bureau, stating that the poisonous salt had been sealed and that it was hoped that good salt would be transported to Yongchun as soon as possible to alleviate the salt shortage. As a result, the price of old salt originally stored in Yongchun rose sharply, selling for one dime per catty, yet people remained suspicious and hesitant, resulting in panic. However, the Quanzhou Salt Affairs Bureau denied the poisoning. On the 23rd, a notice was issued in Yongchun, stating: "Case investigation shows that on December 22nd of this year, Wang Bin, the distributor of the Yongde Official Salt Distribution Center, reported that the district office, together with the military, surrounded the Penglai Official Salt Retail Store, claiming that the salt sold contained poisonous substances. Investigation reveals that the salt was indeed transported from the Quanzhou General Office and there are no anomalies. Please telegraph the Yongchun 11th Regiment headquarters and the county government to stop the situation. Based on this, investigation reveals that all official salt distributed by various retail stores belonging to the Yongde Distribution Center was transported from this office. The official salt of this office is entirely from formal salt fields and has undergone chemical testing before leaving the factory. Since no accidents have occurred elsewhere, it is incomprehensible why there is a rumor of poisonous substances in a corner of the Wulizhen area. In addition to telegraphing military and government agencies to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations, this notice is hereby issued to the people of Shuide and counties for their information (omitted below)." However, the salt has not been unsealed as of the 24th, and people dare not buy salt. The Salt Bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation together with the county government and the regimental headquarters. (December 27th)</p>

<p>Since the sudden collapse of the Chunyu Bank in the Western Suburbs in 1933, it has accumulated debts of more than 200,000 yuan. After years of litigation, a solution is gradually being reached. However, a few creditors, including Fan Feng, represented by Chen Maochang, hired lawyer Chen Hanru to file a lawsuit of objection. After mediation by the execution court failed, Fan and others sued Chen Maochang at the prosecutor's office for colluding with depositors and forging meeting minutes for a 20% repayment agreement, damaging the rights of other creditors. The prosecutor's office accepted the complaint and once summoned Chen for questioning, ordering Chen to provide cash bail pending trial.</p>

<p>The capacity of the prison and detention center in this county was originally set at 400 inmates. Recently, due to a sharp increase in opium-related cases, the number of detainees and convicts in both places has reached more than 600, exceeding the original capacity by more than half, resulting in extreme overcrowding. Ye Chengshu, the warden of the prison and concurrently the director of the detention center, has submitted a request to the county government for permission to alleviate the situation through bail and parole. However, after a recent investigation, the number of inmates in the prison and detention center who meet the requirements for parole is very small. It is now proposed to allocate a portion of the inmates to learn crafts in order to alleviate the overcrowding. The search for factory locations is currently underway and is expected to be realized soon.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Random Notes from a Trip to Europe (2) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan</p>
<p>6.  Being a Foreign Correspondent</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg, the Minister of the Foreign Political Department of the German National Socialist Party, is one of the most important theorists of National Socialism (often referred to as Hitlerism by foreign newspapers). His books are not only good materials for us to study National Socialism, but he is also said to be a key figure in charge of German foreign policy. He often hosts guests once a month, and each time there is a speech by a famous member of the National Socialist Party. The people invited are all foreign diplomats and journalists stationed in Germany. One time, the speaker was Mr. Lutze, the Supreme Commander of the National Socialist Party's Stormtroopers (SA). Mr. Lutze's speech mainly explained that the current instability in the world is the result of Jewish, Communist, and Soviet Russian troublemaking, and he expressed Germany's sincere efforts to safeguard world peace. Although we often hear his arguments in Germany and do not find them particularly novel, the audience that day was foreign diplomats and journalists, and many of them were of Jewish descent. For example, sitting next to me was the German correspondent for the Soviet Russian newspaper Pravda, who happened to be the target of Mr. Lutze's attack that day: Jews, Communists, and Soviet Russian nationals. Although that correspondent was present during Mr. Lutze's speech, he remained calm throughout, with no expression on his face, and only kept smoking cigarettes desperately. Later, I secretly asked him for his thoughts, and he said, "What else can I do? I'm used to it and don't feel anything." Then I thought of the experiences of German journalists in Moscow.</p>
<p>A British journalist said, "Sir, don't just worry about the 'colleagues' from Germany and Russia. In fact, the most pitiful are we foreign correspondents from 'democratic' countries. We don't know if we will be expelled tomorrow. The guarantee our country gives us is just a piece of empty paper of protest. Germany and Russia are dictatorships. If the German government expels a Russian journalist today, Moscow will immediately be missing a German journalist tomorrow. So journalists from these two countries dare to attack each other's weaknesses as much as possible without any scruples. They are the ones to be envied. Like us, we can only be worried every day!"</p>
<p>7. A Female Journalist</p>
<p>Since the German National Socialist Party came to power and Dr. Goebbels became the Minister of Propaganda, foreign journalists stationed in Germany have found it particularly difficult to gather news. There are two main sources for ordinary foreign correspondents to gather news: referring to local newspapers. However, after all German newspapers have been checked by the Propaganda Department, it is not easy to find any special materials there. All important political news is published simultaneously by all newspapers at the time designated by the authorities. In this way, German journalists are unable to develop their personal talents directly. Indirectly, foreign journalists stationed in Germany are also being affected. Secondly, frequent interactions with local people. In recent years, due to political reasons, the interactions between ordinary Germans and foreign journalists have gradually decreased. This point has become a fatal injury for foreign journalists stationed in Germany. Except for a few famous journalists, everyone is gradually finding it difficult to make a living. Although there is still one exception.</p>
<p>A few months ago, in the days before Germany was about to march into the Rhineland, rumors spread in Berlin that there would be a major event. Foreign journalists naturally went out to inquire, hoping to immediately report on this news. However, everyone wasted a lot of effort, and in the end, they only found out after the German official announcement was issued. Only one Polish female reporter actually obtained all the news twenty-four hours before the advance. She immediately telegraphed this news to Warsaw. As a result, this Polish newspaper was the first newspaper in the world to publish this news. After reading the report, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Polish ambassador in Berlin to inquire about the truth of the German advance into the Rhineland. It can be seen that the German government kept this news very secret in the diplomatic world.</p>
<p>In Europe, female reporters are not highly valued. People in the journalism industry also have this view. This time, the female reporter actually created a new record in such a difficult situation. We can imagine her pride. Later, I told this story to an acquaintance. He said, "Humph! It's a female reporter, of course! I said: Brother, you can't misunderstand. I know her, she is a middle-aged woman in her forties or fifties."</p>
<p>8. London Newspapers</p>
<p>British politicians like to say that the British navy is the best in the world, the army is also the best in the world, and the air force will soon be the best in the world. Reuters has been actively promoting this view in Chinese newspapers. The reason is very simple. British colonies are all over the world. Since other people are unwilling to say so, then we have to come forward ourselves.</p>
<p>A month ago, former British Prime Minister MacDonald, as usual, said at the British Journalists' Association that British newspapers are the best in the world. Even if Mr. MacDonald didn't say this, we would also like to promote it for it. British newspapers not only deserve this honor in terms of editing, printing, and circulation, but they have also become a tool for educating the public. Most importantly, reading newspapers has become a part of people's daily lives. Whether on trains, subways, or buses, you can almost see every passenger with a newspaper. From the far-right newspaper, the Mail, to the far-left communist organ, the Daily Worker, from the dignified Times to the Sunday papers read by carters and maids, such as the News of the World (which has a circulation of 3.35 million copies), there are all kinds. In this process, you can easily choose a newspaper to read according to your taste. Or reading several newspapers at the same time will not make you feel dry, because each newspaper has its own special features. In the UK, an ordinary box of cigarettes is priced at six old pence, while each newspaper only costs one penny.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Nine Wins in Nine Matches: Tung Wah Wins Reserve Team Championship - French Club Forfeits Yesterday <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football League Reserve Team League, since its inception, has enjoyed good weather, so the forty-five matches have concluded satisfactorily yesterday. The two authorities in the football world, Chinese and Western, Tung Wah and French Club, met yesterday in the final closing match. However, Tung Wah, with the strength of eight wins in eight matches, had already secured the championship. Knowing they had no hope, and with a lack of players, the French Club temporarily announced their forfeiture. Tung Wah thus maintained their invincible honor with nine wins in nine matches and won the inaugural Reserve Team Championship. The Reserve Team Silver Cup, which was formerly the Senior Cup suspended for many years, was also kept by Tung Wah. However, yesterday in Hongkou Park, the audience expected the match to be exciting, so no less than 3,000 people surrounded and watched. In order to avoid disappointing the audience, both sides temporarily negotiated and changed the match to a friendly game. The French Club also supplemented their team with three elite players from the A team, Robert Stoffer, Willie Walter, and Pike. Chen Jixiang was still the referee, and the match took place on the same field. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. After the restart, Robert Stoffer scored again, but Jia Jiliang equalized again to make it 2-2. In the end, four to two, the French Club won by a narrow margin. Currently, the Tung Wah authorities, in order to celebrate the safe return of Military Committee Chairman Chiang, are preparing to go to Beijing in the New Year to have a celebratory match with the local strong team. Xie Guoren was specially dispatched on the night train yesterday after the match to contact everything. The Tung Wah lineup yesterday was as follows:</p>

<p>Jinan and Western Merchants met again yesterday at Shen Garden for the second round of the West League A Group football match, competing for the fourth place. Jinan had rallied briefly in the middle of last month, but the good times did not last long, and recently it has felt like its performance is declining rapidly. Yesterday, Wang Nanzhen was absent due to the Iron City Cup basketball game in the evening, and Yin Guiren was also absent at the same time. Ye Peichu was also absent due to exams, making the lineup even more sparse.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>As a result, Western Merchants had the advantage of the sun at their backs and the wind at their sails. Although Jinan took the initiative, they were quickly intercepted, and at the same time, their own territory was in danger. After holding on for seven minutes, Western Merchant's left winger, Allison, crossed the ball from the baseline, hitting Xu Hongyin, who deflected it into his own net, opening the scoring. After that, Jinan repeatedly encountered dangerous situations, but fortunately, the defense was effective and they did not concede again. However, the situation was still controlled by Western Merchants. Jinan only managed to get one scoring opportunity with great difficulty, and won a free kick 15 yards out. Although Zhang Riyuan's kick was good, Cai Daojin was a step too late and missed the chance. When 34 minutes had passed, Allison attacked again, and Yifu Glai Fu received the ball that De Luse missed between his legs and scored with one touch, giving Western Merchants a two-goal lead. Jinan fought back vigorously, and about four minutes before the break, Cai Daojin advanced along the wing and crossed the ball. Pei Yongnan shot from 15 yards out, pulling back one goal. However, two minutes later, Guan Jiyang mistakenly committed a handball, and a penalty was awarded. Jack scored the penalty, giving Western Merchants a 3-1 lead at halftime.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After the restart, Jinan had the advantage of favorable terrain, but heaven did not help them, and the wind stopped suddenly, causing their sluggish feet to fail to take advantage of the wind. Xue Yongyuan, Wu Shufen, Shi Yongnan, and others had several good chances, but they were all saved by the two defenders of Western Merchants one by one. Although the attack intensified, all their efforts were in vain. After 17 minutes, Western Merchants launched a large-scale attack, and the area in front of Jinan's goal was chaotic. Yifu Glai Fu took advantage of the situation and scored with one shot, securing the victory with a 4-1 lead. Afterwards, although Jinan still tried their best to attack, with Chen Zhenxiang moved forward to charge, they ultimately failed to achieve anything. However, when Wu Shufen advanced to about five yards from the opponent's goal, Gilbert Meng desperately rushed out to save, but Wu's hard foot unfortunately hit Gilbert's lower abdomen. The ball was saved, but the person also fell to the ground injured. The match was temporarily suspended, and Western Merchants replaced their left forward Moore with a goalkeeper, while Gilbert Meng temporarily went out to rest. Fortunately, after a few minutes, he recovered and barely managed to hold on until the end of the game, which ended with a 4-1 victory for Western Merchants. According to the first time Jinan met Western Merchants, they also lost 2-1, so Western Merchants should have a greater advantage in the future development, and Western Merchants can generally stand out in the fourth place. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Merchants Association</p>
<p>Gilbert Meng</p>
<p>Greenberg, Hollistin</p>
<p>Moore, Jack, Han Meng</p>
<p>Allison, De Luse, McLellan, Yifu Ge, Lai Fu, Tou Tuo Meng</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Huang Shideng</p>

<p>Among the three games of Shanghai basketball clubs last night, the game between Yi San Post Office and Shang Zhong was the most exciting.

<h3 id="e94">MEASURES TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE USE OF RADIOS ANNOUNCED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education formulated and announced the measures to maintain the effective use of radios on the 26th. The original text is as follows: (1) The education halls and bureaus in each province and city should, in accordance with the provisions of item 3 of the broadcasting education implementation measures issued by the Ministry, quickly delineate broadcasting education guidance areas and appoint graduates of the Ministry's electrical education training class to serve as guidance officers in each area. (2) Each broadcasting area should establish a radio repair center so that it can be repaired at any time when parts are damaged. However, for provinces and cities with a small number of radio stations, a repair center may be established within the hall or bureau, and repair tools should be purchased to carry out repairs. The purchase of these repair tools should be paid for by the education halls and bureaus of each province and city to the Ministry for ordering from various factories on their behalf (each set of radio repair tools costs 210 yuan). However, the Ministry may provide subsidies to remote and poor provinces. If the professional personnel who repair radios, such as the electrical education personnel who have been sent by the provinces and cities to the Ministry for training, are not qualified due to insufficient academic qualifications, the education halls and bureaus of each province and city may first select one or two of the best-educated among them and report them to the Ministry. The Ministry will transfer them to major electrical machinery factories for internships. The internship period is temporarily set at two months. During the internship period, the original service unit will continue to pay the original salary on a monthly basis. (3) When the radios in each school or library in each province and city cannot receive sound or encounter other obstacles, they should immediately report to the broadcasting education guidance area to which they belong for repair. (4) If the parts are too badly damaged to be repaired, they may be sent by the education halls and bureaus of each province and city to the Ministry for replacement with a new machine. The round-trip transportation costs will be borne by the original radio station, but the Ministry may provide subsidies to remote and poor provinces. (5) The dry batteries prepared for DC radios can usually only be used for two or three months. After that, new batteries must be purchased. Each frame radio must purchase new dry batteries at least four times a year. The purchase of these dry batteries should be based on a comprehensive calculation of the number of dry batteries that need to be replaced for all the radios installed in the schools and libraries in the province and city, and the purchase should be ordered in large quantities from the Ministry, and the cost of each set of dry batteries, 19 yuan and 6 jiao, should be paid at one time, so that they can be purchased from the Construction Committee's Lei Machinery Factory. (6) The Ministry may consider providing subsidies to schools and libraries in remote and poor provinces that need dry batteries. (7) If the education halls and bureaus of each province and city and each school or library have any questions about the situation of radios, they can directly ask the broadcasting education committee of the Ministry.</p>

<p>Two Railway Party Branches</p>
<p>The Special Party Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, on the occasion of Chairman Chiang's safe return to the capital, specially convened the party members of the railway yesterday in the railway bureau auditorium to hold a celebratory meeting for Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. More than a thousand colleagues from various departments attended. At the start of the celebration, they first sang the Party Song and the Leader's Song. Then, Chairman Chen Chengshi respectfully read the Premier's testament. Following this, Chairman Li Dasan reported on the significance of the celebration, with the gist as follows: "Today's celebration of Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing is of great significance. First, the greatness of the leader's personality: in Xi'an, he faced adversity, unyielding in the face of coercion, placing life and death aside. Second, Zhang Xueliang and others, incited by treacherous individuals, staged a rebellion, but after reading the leader's diary, they were deeply moved by his sincerity, suddenly awakened, and respectfully escorted the leader back to Nanjing to exercise his duties. We know that the leader's captivity was the crisis of the Chinese nation. Today, the leader's safe return to Nanjing is the glory of national revival. From now on, we should continue to work hard, be loyal to the Party and the nation, support the leader, and abide by the Premier's teachings to achieve the goal of China's independence, freedom, and equality," and so on. After that, Railway Bureau representative Secretary Fan Shouzhi, Chief of the Xiao Transportation Office Wei Guo, Party Branch Standing Committee member Chen Chengshi, and Secretary-General Shi Guoyuan delivered speeches in succession. After shouting slogans, the entire group went downstairs, took a photo in front of the gate, and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Security Teams</p>
<p>The Party Affairs Guidance Committee convened representatives from subordinate party branches and teams yesterday to hold an enthusiastic celebration of Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. More than three hundred and fifty representatives from party branches and teams attended. The meeting was originally chaired by Mayor Wu, who also served as a committee member, but due to Mayor Wu's important official duties, Committee member Shi Ziya took over as chairman. He led the attendees in performing the rituals as required and delivered a report on the spot, stating briefly, "Since the leader's misfortune, the people of the country have been filled with worry and indignation. This is because Chairman Chiang's safety is the safety of the nation and the country. Fortunately, Heaven has blessed China, and Chairman Chiang has safely arrived in Nanjing to exercise his duties. In the future, our nation and country will once again advance under the leadership of Chairman Chiang towards the three paths of independence, freedom, and equality. The bright and splendid future is foreseeable. My comrades and compatriots, from now on, should redouble our efforts, adhere to the leader's national salvation ideas, and eliminate national difficulties. This is why I wish our leader had experienced such hardship for the sake of the country, suffering several days of confinement, but his military duty was also irreproachable," and so on. Then, Deputy Commander Hua Zhou of the General Regiment gave a speech, stating briefly, "Since Chairman Chiang's misfortune, social order has been well-maintained, and the whole country has responded calmly. Ultimately, through the inspiration of Chairman Chiang's great personality, and the expression of the collective strength of the people, he escaped danger and came to Nanjing. This demonstrates that our country's organizational strength has been enhanced. By using this strength to save the country, what country cannot be saved? I hope that our compatriots will learn from this experience, and, without being idle or slack, under the leadership of our leader, unite sincerely, and move forward in unison. The day of light will not be far away," and so on. Then, they shouted slogans, and the resounding cheers shook the sky. The joyful scene is hard to describe with words.</p>
<p>The Entire City's Labor Circles</p>
<p>The city's General Labor Union, on the occasion of Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing, specially convened representatives from the city's labor circles at 2:00 PM yesterday to hold a celebratory meeting. Representatives from more than eighty labor unions attended, including those from the hat-making industry in the Fourth District, pharmacies, the cotton spinning industry in the Tenth District, ink manufacturing, civil shipping, winemaking, the candle industry, the Fourth District cigarette industry, the Fourth District shipbuilding industry, the First District shipbuilding industry, the firewood industry in the Fifth District, the fresh pork industry, the paper-making industry in the Fifth District, the postal service, the cotton spinning industry in the Fifth District, the sauce industry, the paper-making industry in the First District, the towing and barge industry, the wooden shipbuilding industry, southern goods, the British public bus company, the ivory industry, elevators, the cleaning industry in the First District, the cosmetics industry in the First District, water and electricity in the Sixth District, bus drivers, soap and medicine in the Ninth District, leather manufacturing in the Sixth District, military uniform manufacturing in the Sixth District, cardboard, and the public bus company in the Sixth District, etc., including Fan Yifeng, Li Hua, Zhou Qigui, Liu Zhigang, Zhang Yuanming, Bao Boyi, Hu Menglin, Li Fuqing, Ding Kunshan, Tang Zhengqiao, Le Junwen, Wu Houbao, Wang Jianchong, Bao Jiasheng, Yu Dongsheng, Hu Peiji, Yu Hongzhang, Wang Bingkui, Mo Songli, Shui Xiangyun, Shen Jiabin, and others, totaling more than three hundred people. After performing the rituals as required, Chairman Ju Xuexiang first reported on the significance of the celebration, stating briefly, "Since Chairman Chiang escaped danger in Xi'an on the afternoon of the 25th of this month, the people across the country have been pleased and gratified, especially in Shanghai. Our labor circles deeply feel that Chairman Chiang's leadership has been effective and should celebrate even more. Now that Chairman Chiang has safely arrived in the capital and Zhang Xueliang has also come along, it is evident that he has indeed shown a determination to repent. The central government can grant him a lenient punishment. The Shanghai City Party Branch has specially decided to convene a citizens' assembly tomorrow to celebrate Chairman Chiang's escape from danger. As for the method, it will be reported by Standing Committee member Ye Xianggao of this union." He added, "Now that foreign insults are becoming increasingly urgent, the only person who can lead the nation's revival and liberate the workers is Chairman Chiang, who can shoulder this heavy responsibility. Therefore, we can only support the leader to revive the Republic of China and liberate the suffering of the workers. The purpose of today's meeting is to celebrate Chairman Chiang's escape from danger, his continued governance, and the revival of the Chinese nation," and so on. Then, Standing Committee member Ye Xianggao reported on the method of the citizens' assembly to be convened by the City Party Branch tomorrow, hoping that the workers would enthusiastically participate to show the enthusiasm of our labor circles in supporting the leader. Subsequently, Standing Committee member Shao Xubai gave a speech, stating briefly, "Since our supreme leader encountered misfortune in Xi'an, the people across the country have been shocked, as the country was in the midst of unification and resistance against the enemy was just beginning, encountering such a great disaster has placed the country in a critical situation. In addition to requesting the central government to punish the rebels, the Shanghai labor circles have also convened a labor circles discussion meeting to discuss maintaining local order. During these fourteen days, although there were some disputes, they were resolved immediately through the mediation of the Party and government. This proves that the workers have recognized the seriousness of the situation and are willing to step back to maintain order. Furthermore, the same calm response and adaptability of business circles and others are sufficient to prove the increased awareness of the people across the country. When the news of Chairman Chiang's escape from danger arrived, the enthusiastic emotions of the people from all walks of life were unprecedented, which is even more sufficient to prove the enthusiasm of the people in supporting the leader. We dare to say that this situation is no less than that of Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy. From this incident, it can be seen that the strength of the Chinese people has been fully demonstrated. Our country has transformed from scattered sand into unity and from disorganized to organized. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the country will not be difficult to revive and the lost territories will not be difficult to recover," and so on. In addition, the Yongjin Society, organized by the city's labor circles, and all the workers undergoing training held celebrations separately in the courtyards of their factories after receiving the news of Chairman Chiang's escape from danger. At the same time, in order to express its support for the leader, the society decided to convene a general assembly on New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China to hold a grand celebration.</p>

<p>The Junkers aircraft No. 15 of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, which was detained in Xi'an, departed from Xi'an at 8:40 AM yesterday, carrying government officials Chen Cheng, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Jicheng, Qian Dajun, Wei Lihuang, Wan Yaohuang, Chen Diaoyuan, Zhu Shaoliang, Jiang Fangzhen, Jiang Xiaozhong, Section Chief Shao, and others, a total of eleven people. It stopped briefly in Zhengzhou around noon and arrived in Nanjing at 2:00 PM. Except for Jiang Fangzhen, who came to Shanghai on the same plane, all others disembarked in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Pilot Celebrates Airplane's Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The airplane departed from Nanjing at 2:10 PM. According to the scheduled itinerary, it could have arrived at Longhua Airport at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. However, the pilot had been trapped in Xi'an for two weeks, and he was very happy to return to Shanghai safely. He specially flew around the city three times to mark the celebration. It finally landed at the airport at 4:25 PM. At that time, the company personnel were all at the airport to welcome them and extended their sympathy to the pilot and mechanics. They also opened champagne in the airport office to show their appreciation. The pilot, Ross, the mechanic, Fei Xier, and the telegraph operator all raised their glasses and drank heartily. However, each person had been trapped for more than ten days and had not shaved for a long time, and their short beards were disheveled. Amidst the joyful expression, their appearance was very comical.</p>
<p>Recounting the Situation at the Time of the Incident</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reporter rushed to the airport in advance to wait. According to the person in charge of managing the cargo on the plane, when the incident occurred, it was around 8:00 PM on the 11th. Gunshots were heard, starting sparsely and becoming dense. At that time, they only felt panic and confusion and did not understand what was happening. Only at dawn did they learn that an incident had occurred. Zhang Xueliang's soldiers stationed at the airport had already killed several people. However, the exact situation was still unclear because the airport was heavily guarded and completely isolated from the outside world, making it impossible to inquire about the facts. After several days, due to food shortages, the pilot negotiated and obtained several bags of flour. On the 25th, they learned that the incident had been resolved. The machinery of the airplane at Xi'an Airport had not been damaged, so there were no losses.</p>
<p>Jiang Fang Returns to Shanghai on the Airplane</p>
<p>Jiang Fangzhen, a famous veteran of the army, took a plane from Nanjing to Xi'an on the 11th of this month, originally to report to Chairman Chiang on his visit to various European countries for inspection. Unexpectedly, he encountered the incident and was also detained. He returned to Shanghai on the plane yesterday. After meeting with Jiang at the airport, the Xin Xin News Agency reporter went to visit his private residence on Guofu Men Road. According to him, when the incident occurred on the night of the 11th, he heard sparse gunshots at the Xijing Guest House and did not mind them. He still slept soundly. The next morning, the mutinous soldiers entered the guest house to search, and only then did he understand. Mr. Shao Yuanchong suddenly fled that night and was shot dead by the mutinous soldiers. Mr. Shao Lizi's wife was injured. The rumor that she had passed away is not accurate. This morning, he left Shaanxi and returned to Shanghai on the Eurasia airplane, designated by government order.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the company's regular flight No. 17 Junkers arrived in Shanghai at 6:15 PM last night. According to information obtained by the Xin Sheng News Agency, the generals who were detained in Shaanxi, Qian Dajun, Mao Bangchu, and others, totaling fifteen people, took this plane south. They disembarked when the plane passed through Nanjing, and none of them came to Shanghai on it.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Italian Consul General Bonaigli Scheduled to Return to His Country Next Month <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Count Bonaigli, the Italian Consul General stationed in China, will be departing for his home country to take up a new position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Count has resided in Shanghai for two years and has enjoyed a considerable reputation among Chinese and international circles. He has been committed to promoting Sino-Italian relations on a regular basis. In recent months, he has inspected Italian churches in Xi'an, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, and other places, learning that they have increased from fifteen to twenty-three in recent years and have established free schools. The expansion of their operations is largely due to the support of the local authorities. It is believed that after the Count returns to Rome, he will report the beneficial news of China's current situation to the Italian government, further strengthening the relations between the two countries. The Italian community in this city has prepared to host a banquet to bid farewell to the Count.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Chen Zhaoying Discusses Rapid Progress of Fujian Province People, Love for Country and Leader, Taking Pride in Using National Products <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhaoying, Inspector of Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, flew from Fujian to Shanghai yesterday and stayed at Mr. Zhang's residence on Moore Road. He is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to report to the Central Government on the recent situation in Fujian Province and the process of his inspection tour in eastern Fujian. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Mr. Chen yesterday afternoon and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Progress of the People</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen, since the Xi'an Incident, Fujian Province has been quite peaceful. Although the financial circles were extremely nervous for two days, the 13th and 14th, they quickly stabilized. This is because the people learned that Chairman Chiang was safe in Shaanxi and were deeply convinced that he would be out of danger soon. In recent years, the people have made rapid progress and have a deep understanding of the country and the leader, regarding the leader's freedom as their own freedom and the leader's safety as their own safety. On the 17th, Fujian Province received a telegram from Shanghai that falsely reported that Chairman Chiang had been in danger, and the people spontaneously set off firecrackers to celebrate, spending as much as 30,000 yuan. On the 25th, when they learned that Chairman Chiang had safely arrived in Luoyang, the people were overjoyed and set off firecrackers, spending as much as 100,000 yuan. This is enough to show the people's support for the government and their love for the leader. The effect of the government's usual training of the people is also manifested in this fact. I am deeply convinced that once the war of national survival breaks out, the people will be able to work together under the leadership of the government.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Fujian Province</p>
<p>The Party, government, and military in Fujian Province can cooperate closely, and every movement and undertaking can be jointly promoted, with multiplied effects. During my inspection tour of various places in eastern Fujian, although the transportation is inconvenient, the people are also very progressive. Moreover, the people in several places are proud of using national products and ashamed of using foreign goods. Imported goods have completely disappeared. This phenomenon will be even more widespread in the future. The troops are making great efforts to suppress the remaining bandits in eastern Fujian, and it is expected that they can be wiped out within a month and a half. Recently, Fujian Province has been promoting the Baojia system, and the burden on the people is relatively heavy. The provincial government is currently planning to reduce it.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing Soon</p>
<p>President Yu has been ordered to go to Shaanxi to express his condolences. It is said that he will leave for Beijing in a day or two. I will enter Beijing tonight (the 27th) and plan to stay in Beijing for a few days before transferring to Zhejiang to inspect the expansion of the Binshan Baisha Elementary School.</p>
<p>Supporting Suiyuan Fundraising Campaign</p>
<p>Binshan County Baisha Elementary School has achieved great results in the implementation of special education. On November 17th of this year, it held a fundraising event for the whole school to support Suiyuan. The donated funds were sent to this newspaper to be transferred to the front line. It is now known that the school recently implemented a Suiyuan support center training and, after class, united with all sectors of society to hold an expanded Suiyuan support fundraising campaign. Each team went to the Yangxing Town area to distribute leaflets and solicit donations from door to door. A total of 19.5 yuan was donated and has been sent to this newspaper to be transferred to the front line. It is also known that the school has printed the fundraising accounts and posted them on the streets to report to the donors.</p>

<p>After the news of Chairman Chiang's escape from Xi'an and arrival in Luoyang spread, everyone rejoiced. After hearing the news at more than 7 pm on the 25th, all institutions, shops, and residents in Wusong set off firecrackers, and the sound of firecrackers was incessant. The enthusiastic situation was truly unprecedented. At that time, Cheng Songling, the owner of Dafeng Wood Company on Waima Road and a reporter for the Xinwen Daily in Wusong, took his son Xizhi, who was nine years old, home after a night banquet after paying respects at the home of the late famous doctor Zhong Yuyu. While they were walking home, the street was full of firecrackers and excitement. Xizhi, a nine-year-old child, heard passers-by say that Chiang Gong had escaped danger and returned to Beijing. He immediately jumped, clapped his hands, laughed, and walked while laughing until he laughed at home. Unexpectedly, his little mouth was suddenly crooked from laughing. His father was shocked when he saw it and specially invited a doctor to treat him, and he did not recover until yesterday. This is also an interesting story in the midst of cheers.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Wenzhou fishing boat Zheng Shuntai Ou Zi No. 328 loaded firewood chips and stone chips from Ou to Shanghai. After unloading, it loaded umbrellas, bamboo stones, alkali, and other southern goods to Zhejiang. It exited Shanghai at 2 pm on the previous day (the 26th) and sailed to the ferry pier in Gaoqiao City. Suddenly, a tugboat of the Dredging Bureau towed an iron-shelled mud barge and exited from the rear. Because the tugboat was going too fast, it collided with the port side of the Zheng Shuntai, and water entered the cabin and sank immediately. After the accident, the tugboat did not stop and continued to sail away. Seven crew members of the fishing boat, Xie Guixian, etc., swam to the shore and landed, so they were not drowned. The shipowner, Zheng Huanshan, suffered heavy losses because the ship and goods were all sunk. Moreover, the area is an important channel for ships to enter and exit, and he is afraid of obstructing navigation. He specially asked Yang Bao and the customs broker to file a report with the Zhanghuabang Customs Hebos Division, requesting that measures be taken to salvage the sunken ship and negotiate with the Dredging Bureau for valuation and compensation in order to uphold justice and maintain shipping.</p>

<p>The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association recently investigated and found that there are more than 500,000 residents in this concession. Now that it is severe winter, petty thieves are active, and robberies, etc., are frequently heard. They have already sent a letter to the police authorities asking them to pay attention. Moreover, the association believes that residents who are suspected of committing crimes must be searched when necessary. However, in the spirit of a country ruled by law, the residence and body of the people should be absolutely free and inviolable except in accordance with legal procedures. In the past, there were always those who broke into people's homes without holding a court search warrant, which was really inappropriate. The association has sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, asking the French authorities that in the future, if there is a situation of searching residents, they should follow legal procedures and not infringe on the freedom of the people, etc. After receiving the letter, the French Municipal Council has separately replied to the association, saying that the requested letter has been forwarded to the French Consul-General for review.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Tea in the Dutch East Indies: Japanese Tea and Local Tea Rise to Compete, 12,000 Unemployed Chinese Merchants <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>China's tea exports have always been sold to Europe, America, and various parts of Southeast Asia. Recently, due to the willful squeeze of tea grown in Europe and America and tea from India and Ceylon, Chinese tea has plummeted. Sales in Southeast Asia are also in a very dangerous situation. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency learned from various parties such as tea exporters and overseas Chinese affairs agencies in this port that tea sales in Southeast Asia have been maintained in the past three years. Recently, due to the dumping of Japanese tea and the gradual development of local tea businesses by natives, the Chinese tea market is far from as good as before. The Dutch East Indies tea market has always been uniquely popular with Chinese tea, with annual sales of about several million yuan. There are more than 20,000 Chinese engaged in this industry, and three times as many people depend on it for a living, directly or indirectly. They are quite profitable and occupy an important position in the economy of overseas Chinese. However, six or seven years ago, the Dutch East Indies government was determined to promote local tea planting and sent specialized personnel to guide it. It has had significant results and encouraged residents to buy and drink local tea. Moreover, local tea is cheap, and to this day, local natives and local-born Chinese are happy to use it. Chinese tea has therefore been greatly impacted. In addition, Japanese and Taiwanese tea are also being sold in an attempt to implement their Nanhua policy. Chinese tea is therefore more suppressed. This year, the input of Chinese tea to the Dutch East Indies has greatly declined compared to last year. Last spring, the input of Chinese tea to the Dutch East Indies was 3,000 kilograms, and Japanese and Taiwanese tea, according to the report of the Dutch East Indies Chamber of Commerce, reached more than 1.4 million kilograms. This year, it will be even more active. At present, Chinese tea is in a slump and is in danger of complete collapse. Currently, 70% of Chinese stores that purely operate Chinese tea have closed down. The number of overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs as a result has reached 12,000 to date. More than 9,000 people have returned to their ancestral home due to unemployment. The impact on the lives of overseas Chinese is very serious. The main reason for the collapse of the Chinese tea market is that the cost is too high to compete. Overseas Chinese are paying close attention to this.</p>

<p>Zhao Shen, a 53-year-old woman from Gaoyou, Jiangbei, who lives at No. 58 Boxiang Village, Laozhenfu Road, French Concession, recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Pei Jinfu, a fellow villager residing at No. 15 Jianye Lane, Fulvli Road, of seducing and hiding her daughter, requesting investigation, and attaching a civil suit to recover her daughter. According to the complaint, the plaintiff's daughter, nicknamed Abao, is 20 years old this year. In August of last year, she came to Shanghai with neighbors to work as a servant. It was not known that after arriving in Shanghai, there was no news. It was not until the beginning of October in the old calendar this year that the plaintiff came to Shanghai to look for her and learned that she was working as a servant in the defendant's house. After being seduced into adultery, she was not allowed to communicate with her family. She has already given birth to a son after being raped. The defendant has violated Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, the crime of obstructing morality. Moreover, the plaintiff's daughter has been betrothed to a man in her hometown and is scheduled to be married in the first month of next year. The defendant already has two wives and concubines. When the plaintiff went to find her daughter, the defendant prevented her from meeting. She requests that the defendant be investigated and handled according to law. According to the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff, Zhao Shen, and her lawyer to the court for questioning on the morning of the day before. The defendant was not present. The court ordered that the defendant be summoned again on the 30th for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e128">After Shortening the Expiration Date, the Pawnshop Business Gradually Turns Around <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>This year, the first batch of pawnshops in this city will expire on New Year's Day. Due to the influence of falling prices and changes in the style of full goods for many years, most of them have suffered losses. Therefore, in December of last year, they submitted an application to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to change the expiration date of pawned goods to twelve months (originally eighteen months) in order to save the crisis. From New Year's Day this year, all pawnshops in the city have been implementing this uniformly. In this way, the storage time is reduced, and the sale of goods is not as easy to suffer losses as in the past. At the same time, this year, the price of goods has risen, and the selling price of full goods has also increased accordingly. Therefore, pawnshops this year have shown vitality. Moreover, since the industry implemented the shortening of the pawn period from New Year's Day this year, it will be twelve months until New Year's Day next year. Therefore, a notice will be published in the newspaper in the coming days to urge pawnshop customers to redeem their goods.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Amendment to the Regulations for Managing Prepared Medicines; Notice from the New Medicine Association; Effective January 1st <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of New Medicine Associations yesterday issued a notice to its members nationwide, stating that the Ministry of Health of the Executive Yuan had approved document number Yi Zi 7358, regarding the review of the Regulations for Managing Prepared Medicines. These regulations were promulgated and implemented by the former Ministry of Health in the 19th year of the Republic [1930] and have been in effect for six years. Several provisions are no longer suited to the actual situation, and the permissible limits of narcotic drugs in prepared medicines require revision. Previously, numerous Chinese and foreign pharmaceutical merchants had requested amendments, and opinions were solicited from various parties for consideration. Simultaneously, a general registration of prepared medicines was conducted to meet current needs. Subsequently, the revised Regulations for Managing Prepared Medicines were completed and a draft was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Now, Directive No. 4274, issued on November 28th of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], has been received, approving the record for future reference. Article 15 of the revised regulations stipulates that the effective date of these regulations shall be determined by the Ministry of Health through an order. Furthermore, the general registration of prepared medicines had previously been extended to cease on November 30th of this year. These revised regulations are now scheduled to take effect on January 1st of the 26th year of the Republic [1937]. In addition to separate announcements and communications, and reporting the effective date to the Executive Yuan for record, copies of the revised regulations are hereby issued for the association's information and for dissemination to all colleagues in the industry.

<h3 id="e145">Postal Knowledge Questions (4) <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Question: "In your last Q&amp;A, you stated that ordinary stamps either have an image of Dr. Sun Yat-sen or various martyrs. It seems that there are no other designs. However, I recently purchased several kinds of stamps with sailing ship designs from the post office. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>Answer: The stamps with the images of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs are the new version of stamps that have been successively issued since 1931. The stamps with sailing ship and train designs are older stamps that are still available in post offices, so they are being sold at the same time as the new version. The types of these old version stamps are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Ordinary stamps with sailing ship and train designs: There are eleven denominations: ½ fen, 1 fen, 1½ fen, 2 fen, 3 fen, 4 fen, 5 fen, 6 fen, 7 fen, 8 fen, 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Stamps with agricultural harvest designs: There are six denominations: 1 jiao 3 fen, 1 jiao 5 fen, 1 jiao 6 fen, 2 jiao, 3 jiao, 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Stamps with a round gate design: There are five denominations: 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 20 yuan.</p>
<p>2. Airmail stamps: Printed in two colors, with an image of an airplane and the Great Wall, and the Kuomintang emblem on the tail. There are five denominations: 1 jiao 5 fen, 3 jiao, 4 jiao 5 fen, 6 jiao, 9 jiao.</p>
<p>3. Postage due stamps: Blue and brown, with the words "欠資" (Postage Due) printed in the center. There are eight denominations: ½ fen, 1 fen, 2 fen, 4 fen, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 2 jiao, 3 jiao.</p>
<p>The sale of all of the above stamps, along with single and double postcards with sailing ship and train designs and stationery with a Jiahe design, will be limited to December 31 of this year. Starting January 1, 1937, they will all be discontinued. Within one month after the discontinuation (i.e., from January 1 to January 31, 1937), the public can still use the above-mentioned ordinary stamps, airmail stamps, postcards, or stationery as usual. However, starting February 1, 1937, they will be completely abolished and will no longer be valid. However, if the public still has unused items at that time, they can, within six months after the abolition (i.e., from February 1 to July 31, 1937), exchange them for new versions of ordinary or airmail stamps or new versions of postcards (with Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamp) or special postal cards (with 5 fen Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamp) at the local post office according to the face value. The new version of postcards are only available in single cards of 1 fen (local delivery), 2½ fen (domestic), 1 jiao 5 fen (international), and double cards of 2 fen, 5 fen, 3 jiao, and 6 jiao. For example, if someone has an old 6 fen single postcard and exchanges it at the post office, they can receive ordinary stamps worth 6 fen, or two 2½ fen postcards and one 1 fen postcard, or six 1 fen postcards. In short, the value of the items exchanged must be equal to the original face value. The same applies to the public who has old versions of postage due stamps and wants to exchange them for new versions of stamps, postcards, or special postal cards.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Local Security Guard Xu Tingzhong Shot Dead by Zhang Jinbao; Police Strictly Investigating Zhang <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the second day of last month, at around 8:00 pm, in the Xujiaqiao area of Zhabei, a local security guard named Xu Tingzhong was ambushed by multiple thugs armed with pistols and was fatally wounded on the spot. Details of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the police have determined that the mastermind behind the murder was the notorious gangster Zhang Jinbao (nicknamed "Bandit Jinbao"). Zhang was previously arrested by the Public Concession Police for theft and possession of illegal firearms, and was interrogated and sentenced by the First Special District Court to imprisonment, which he served at Tilanqiao Prison. While Zhang was in prison, his concubine, Ms. Lin, worked at the Zhongxing Silk Factory on Tianbao Road and had an affair with a factory employee named Yu. Zhang learned of the affair after his release and, in a fit of jealousy, secretly plotted revenge. However, his plans were discovered by Ms. Lin and Yu, who, fearing for their lives, informed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters through Yu about Zhang's possession of red pills and other drugs. The Garrison Headquarters ordered an investigation team to search Zhang's house in conjunction with the police. A large number of red pills were found on the spot, but Zhang was out and was not arrested. With the evidence confirmed, the Garrison Headquarters issued a warrant for his arrest and sealed his house. Zhang, suspecting that the local security guard Xu Tingzhong had instigated the affair, retaliated against Xu by instructing his accomplices to shoot him. After the incident, Zhang fled to the Wusong countryside. The police dispatched officers to arrest him, but Zhang fled without a trace. A strict investigation is underway to arrest and punish him.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor, I have been working and living in Shanghai for many years with my wife in Shenjia Lane, No. 71, Pudong. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of this month, my wife disappeared without a trace. I have been searching all day long, but there is still no sign of her.

I will be eternally grateful. I will now list my wife's appearance below.

<h3 id="e166">Shanghai's Electrical Manufacturing Industry (Continued) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor, China Credit Information</p>
<p>(A General Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 40)</p>
<p>As for the market conditions for electrical materials this year, they were initially flat, but after entering autumn, they began to flourish. During this period, due to the unstable situation, customers stocked up on goods, and sales were even stronger. Batteries, flashlights, and electrical materials with military applications were naturally in demand, but even ordinary light bulbs suddenly became in short supply. According to a report in the Dagongbao on November 3rd, the major factories in this city that produce these goods were all busy, and in September some even opened night shifts to increase production to meet market demand. Although some businesses in the industry have recently failed, this is mainly due to long-term mismanagement, not a sudden occurrence. The production and sales of the major factories are briefly described below: In the fall, the A. O. Ear factory had the highest light bulb production and total sales, producing 2.5 million bulbs with a transaction value of about 500,000 yuan. Next was the Huade factory, which produced 440,000 to 450,000 bulbs with a sales value of 200,000 yuan. The Fulai Sheng factory was next, with a production volume exceeding the Huade factory at 500,000 bulbs, but because they were all low-priced bulbs, the sales volume was lower than that of the Huade factory, at only 40,000 yuan. The Yongming factory was next, producing 400,000 bulbs, with a sales value of 54,000 to 55,000 yuan, including the sale of electric beads. Currently, although the sales of light bulbs in the Shanghai market are more active than last season, the market price situation has not increased due to the stable price of raw materials. However, small factories have had to secretly lower their prices to distribute their goods due to the impact of the extremely low-priced, unbranded light bulbs sold on the market. However, the products of major factories can be sold according to their original prices. As for colored light bulbs, such as three-way bulbs and five-way multi-filament bulbs, their unique manufacturing means that they are not as affected by the large number of products as ordinary light bulbs, and they are also not affected by the dumping of unbranded foreign goods. Therefore, the market price is slightly better than other ordinary products. For example, the Central Factory's three-way bulb sells for 40 cents in national currency, but in order to promote sales, it is also necessary to reduce the price slightly.</p>
<p>The market prices of various electrical materials have recently shown a significant upward trend due to the influence of the domestic and foreign situation. Insulated wire and flower wire have already increased by 20% compared to before. Other products are related to foreign raw materials, and manufacturers must increase prices in order to protect their capital. However, sales are even more difficult after the price increase, which is a major difficulty for operators. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e167">Responsibilities of the National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the decision of the Executive Yuan, established the National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to take overall control of grain purchasing, transportation, sales, and surplus/deficit regulation. This Transportation and Sales Bureau was once proposed in the 23rd year (of the Republic, i.e., 1934), but failed to materialize due to various constraints. However, the Transportation and Sales Bureau has always been of great significance in solving the overall grain problem. Now that the matter has been brought up again and the Transportation and Sales Bureau is being actively prepared, it is necessary to study its proper tasks and considerations.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the crux of China's grain problem is the reduction in per-unit arable land productivity combined with frequent disasters, rather than an absolute factor of grain panic. In years of poor harvest, landlords and grain merchants hoarding and speculating often cause grain prices to rise beyond the limits of natural increases, which illustrates that the defects of social and economic organization can surpass natural causes and lead to grain panic. The Transportation and Sales Bureau, in handling the regulation of grain surpluses and deficits, must recognize that the uneven distribution of grain is a problem even more significant than the issue of total output.</p>
<p>At the same time, because of the simplicity of domestic transportation and the complexity of transaction procedures, even if the harvests vary from region to region, and theoretically can be adjusted, in reality, it is still necessary to rely on foreign grain. In disaster years, when grain prices are high, foreign grain pours in, which helps to suppress prices; however, in the same season, the harvest regions still suffer from the phenomenon of low grain prices hurting farmers. In a good harvest year, grain prices should fall, but often fall beyond the natural decline due to the import or dumping of foreign grain (Note 1); sometimes they are too expensive due to foreign purchases (Note 2). The impact of the international market on China's grain surpluses and deficits does not meet the actual needs of China's national conditions. The fundamental reason, of course, is the fluctuation of grain prices. When foreign grain prices fall or Chinese grain prices rise, foreign grain imports increase; when foreign grain prices rise or Chinese grain prices fall, foreign grain imports decrease. The amount of foreign grain imports shifts with the level of domestic grain prices; on the other hand, domestic grain prices are not simply determined by the amount of production. Therefore, the anarchic state of foreign grain imports leads to an increasingly chaotic domestic grain market. The interrelationship between domestic and foreign grain prices is the second key point to be noted by the Transportation and Sales Bureau.</p>
<p>The tasks of the Transportation and Sales Bureau include the operation of purchasing, stockpiling, transporting, and selling. The main key, however, is the control of grain prices. This is because the fluctuation of grain prices can affect the quantity and regional distribution of purchasing, stockpiling, transporting, and selling. In terms of the transportation and sales of inland grain, the amount of grain that grain merchants collect from various towns is determined by the profit remaining after deducting transportation costs and intermediary fees from the inland grain price when converted to the urban grain price. When the converted amount of the two grain prices cannot maintain the profit of the grain merchants, the grain merchants will abandon the domestic grain and compete to purchase foreign grain (Note 3). In terms of the monopoly of landlords and grain merchants, most of the grain is transferred from poor farmers to the stockpiles of landlords and grain merchants, and the profit rate given to landlords and grain merchants by short-term and long-term grain prices becomes the standard for stockpiling or selling. If the elasticity of price fluctuations can be reduced, the possibility of landlords and grain merchants speculating for profit will naturally be reduced, and the circulation of grain can maintain a normal state. Then, the determination of the highest and lowest grain prices becomes the theme of transportation and sales.</p>
<p>Controlling grain prices starts with determining the highest and lowest grain prices, and at the same time, it is necessary to organically use all the processes involved in transportation and sales. For example, when grain prices fall in a bumper year, the Transportation and Sales Bureau stipulates a minimum price based on domestic and foreign grain price indices, price indices, and production costs, and purchases at a high price, or exports through state-owned enterprises (Note 4). The purchased grain is stored on the one hand, and continuously transported to various consumption areas on the other hand, either for sale or for continued storage in preparation for price stabilization in the coming year. If there is a shortage in a year of poor harvest and prices soar, the Transportation and Sales Bureau will still set a maximum price with reference to domestic and foreign grain price indices and price indices, so that landlords and grain merchants know that grain prices will not rise further and will sell their grain one after another. On the one hand, the grain stored over the years is sold at a reduced price, and on the other hand, the import tax on foreign grain is waived. When necessary, purchases are made from China and abroad, or resold, or used to replenish storage. The purchase of foreign grain at high prices must be approved by the Transportation and Sales Bureau in its overall plan. In short, according to the grain price control policy, all transportation and sales matters must be organized and promoted. Therefore, the Transportation and Sales Bureau needs affiliated agencies that are interconnected and coordinated.</p>
<p>According to the organization of the Japanese Rice Bureau, it is divided into rice policy, survey of inland areas, foreign areas, management, and other sections, as well as rice offices. The Rice Policy Section is responsible for various surveys on rice policy, surveys on the exchange of rice supply and demand, rice storage incentives, affairs of rice offices and their offices, and affairs not under the jurisdiction of other sections. The Survey Section is responsible for surveys on rice production costs, surveys on the existing amount of rice, surveys on rice movement, standard minimum and maximum prices, rice processing, transportation, storage, exchange, lending, exchange, processing, and arrangement, the scope of rice with officially set minimum and maximum prices and their price differences, and reporting on certain articles of the Rice Control Enforcement Ordinance. The Foreign Section is responsible for the purchase, sale, storage, exchange, processing, and arrangement of rice from Korea, Taiwan, or foreign countries, all permissions for rice import and export, restrictions on the import of millet, sorghum, and glutinous millet, and increases, decreases, or exemptions of import taxes on rice, millet, sorghum, and glutinous millet. The Foreign Rice Affairs Survey Section is responsible for the adjustment of the special account for rice supply and demand, state-owned property, articles, and construction belonging to the aforementioned account, and the sorting and summarizing of rice-related parts of general accounting matters. The Rice Office is responsible for matters related to the Rice Law (Note 5). The spirit of the Chinese Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau can be said to be completely the same as that of the Japanese Rice Bureau. Therefore, the internal organization of the Transportation and Sales Bureau should at least include rice policy surveys, inland, foreign, management, and other sections, as well as rice offices. The relationship between the sections forms the foundation of the Transportation and Sales Bureau's function, and each section proceeds in a coordinated manner in a comprehensive policy. However, due to financial difficulties, the affiliated agencies of each section cannot be widely distributed and deeply rooted in the countryside. The Transportation and Sales Bureau can appoint commissioners to work jointly with the county governments of various counties. Everything is directly commanded by the competent authorities of the Transportation and Sales Bureau and follows an independent special accounting system, and the funds of the Transportation and Sales Bureau are never mixed with the expenses of the county governments. The existing installations related to grain and general industrial and commercial economic construction, such as the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Communications, Railways, and special agencies, must cooperate according to the requirements of the Transportation and Sales Bureau.</p>
<p>However, the Transportation and Sales Bureau must also pay attention to two points: first, in grain price control, the function of stipulating the maximum price is greater than the function of stipulating the minimum price; second, the existing agricultural warehouses and local granaries should all be operated by the Transportation and Sales Bureau. Regarding the first point, due to the prevalence of rent in kind and grain loans, many farmers pay land rent or repay debts with their harvest, and few sell it voluntarily. The ownership of grain in the market mostly belongs to landlords and grain merchants. Stipulating a minimum price and purchasing at a high price is beneficial to landlords and grain merchants but not to poor farmers. Furthermore, the purchasing policy causes poor farmers to purchase food at high prices during the period of shortage (Note 6). This problem is related to the entire production system, and the Transportation and Sales Bureau cannot cope with it. However, precisely because landlords and grain merchants manipulate grain production, the unlimited increase in grain prices is most harmful to general consumers and poor farmers. Therefore, stipulating a maximum price and suppressing grain prices mainly harms landlords and grain merchants. The significance of protecting consumers and poor farmers is actually deeper than the effect of the minimum price. When the Transportation and Sales Bureau uses the grain price control strategy, this point should be clearly distinguished. Regarding the second point, the Transportation and Sales Bureau should establish a systematic and unified storage agency. Storage is an important stage in the transportation and sales process and functions as a regulator. Although existing farmers' warehouses have the form of storage, the grain stored in them is mostly owned by wealthy farmers, landlords, and grain merchants. Therefore, not only can they not regulate grain prices, but they can disrupt grain prices. Moreover, the financial assistance function of agricultural warehouses is of no benefit to most farming families who have no grain to mortgage. Therefore, the Transportation and Sales Bureau can borrow circulating funds from the financial sector to reorganize the national agricultural warehouses, simplify the function of agricultural warehouses, and turn them into specialized storage places in the grain control policy. The circulation of agricultural finance is then the responsibility of the Agricultural Bank. As for other local storage, the main purpose is to prepare for famine and relieve poverty. The ability of local granaries to stabilize grain prices is often offset by the influence of grain from other regions. Only when the national grain price control policy is implemented and local granaries follow the planned instructions of the Transportation and Sales Bureau can it be effective. Farmers' warehouses and local granaries are all under the control of the Transportation and Sales Bureau, and all stored grain can be transported to various places in advance (Note 7) or temporarily as needed. In short, it must correspond to the stability of grain prices and the regulation of surpluses and deficits.</p>
<p>The National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau bears a major mission for the solution of China's entire grain problem. Its main task should be the control of grain prices. Whether it is purchasing, stockpiling, transporting, or selling, it must be carried out organically under the control of grain prices in order to exert the full function of transportation and sales; at the same time, attention must be paid to the special roles of wealthy farmers, landlords, and grain merchants, as well as foreign grain, in the domestic grain market.</p>
<p>(Note 1) In the year of the great flood in 1931 and the bumper harvest in 1932, the import of foreign rice was either very little or, on the contrary, more. The reason is that in the bumper year of 1930, 1931 was sufficient for self-sufficiency (referring to the Yangtze River basin). By the time of the great flood, it was already early autumn. At that time, what caused panic was the people's food for the coming year. Merchants ordered foreign rice, so although there was a bumper harvest, the import of foreign rice was more, and the rice price fell beyond the appropriate limit.</p>
<p>(Note 2) This year there was a bumper harvest in almost the entire country, but some people took the opportunity to come to China to purchase, and the grain price unexpectedly rose, which is a phenomenon that should not occur in a bumper year.</p>
<p>(Note 3) "Improving Rice and Wheat and Equalizing Transportation" by Cao Yumin, Nationalities Magazine, Volume 3, Issue 12, page 2036:</p>
<p>(Note 4) Article 2 of the Interim Measures for Food Regulation promulgated by the Executive Yuan this year allows exports. The basis is that the food market price this year is not significantly different from the same period last year, and according to customs reports, food imports in the first ten months of this year were far above exports. However, wheat prices have risen in various countries this year, and Japan has also purchased large quantities of rice from China, Siam, and Annam. The export of rice and grain from Siam and Annam to China is also decreasing. If China allows exports without restrictions, there will be no supplementary measures for grain next year. It is necessary for the Transportation and Sales Bureau to handle the so-called state-owned exports.</p>
<p>(Note 5) "Rural Cooperation and Agricultural Warehouses in Japan" by Xu Yuanruo, page 11:</p>
<p>(Note 6) Stipulating a minimum price and purchasing grain at a high price only benefits wealthy farmers, landlords, and grain merchants, while poor farmers receive no benefit. This is the predicament encountered by the Japanese Wealthy Farmers Grain Control Law.</p>
<p>(Note 7) This year, there was a bumper harvest, but the Yuehan Railway could not transport it in time, resulting in a trend of importing foreign rice in Guangdong Province. If the Transportation and Sales Bureau makes an overall plan, after the harvest season, the surplus grain from the producing areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui can be gradually transported to Guangdong for storage and regulation in the coming year. The grain in the producing areas will be purchased by the Transportation and Sales Bureau, and the grain price will not fall due to the temporary congestion of production. Every year, it is announced that the surplus grain from the producing areas will be gradually transported to the sales areas, and the price will not be expensive due to the lack of transportation. The Transportation and Sales Bureau must manage the transportation and sales in the form of purchasing and storage. This is also one of the reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Review of Grain Control in Various Provinces (Continued) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>Anhui: Anhui Province is also a rice-surplus province; the various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and rice-deficient coastal provinces often rely on the supply of rice from Wuhu. Therefore, the rice production in Anhui Province is also very important in the food status of our country. This year, the Anhui provincial authorities are dealing with the province's food problem: first, they are taking the warehousing policy as the center, and the source of its storage mortgage funds is provided by the Shanghai China Agricultural Credit Syndicate; the person in charge of the syndicate has signed an agricultural warehouse credit contract of one million yuan with the Construction and Finance Departments, and the Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Management Office is designated to build provincial warehouses in twenty-four counties including Fengyang; county warehouses are generally set up in other counties; the provincial and county warehouses will be completed before the end of September. The heads of each warehouse have also received agricultural loan business from the syndicate office in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, the issue of grain being exported abroad arose, and people from North China went to Anhui to absorb a large amount of rice, and good merchants went deep into the countryside to search for rice from farmers to be transported to the north. This resulted in scarce sources on the market and soaring grain prices. At this point, the authorities decided to issue an order banning the export of Anhui rice to remedy the situation. However, neighboring provinces and cities can still be assisted with the approval of formal civilian applications. As a result, the grain trade in Anhui Province is managed by the provincial government. As for the future storage and transportation of rice in the province, the Construction Department is drafting a plan for selling Anhui rice to Guangdong.</p>
<p>B. Rice Self-Sufficient Provinces</p>
<p>Jiangsu: Jiangsu is the province with the most fluid rice and grain. The rice imported over the years is not for consumption in the province; and the rice exported is not all produced in the province. It is estimated that Jiangsu's grain production is sufficient in normal years. Since the problem of national rice leaking to the sea, it has been severely felt. The provincial government, fearing the years of shortage and that traitors would transport grain to support the enemy, passed ten articles of the "Temporary Measures for Strictly Prohibiting the Export of Food in Jiangsu Province" at a provincial government meeting on October 27; ordering all subordinate regions to strictly prohibit the export of food. Thereupon, the province's food trade was under the strict supervision of the provincial authorities. (Note: It has been decided to abolish it at the provincial government meeting on December 8)</p>
<p>C. Rice Deficient Provinces</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Generally speaking, Zhejiang Province feels that there is a food shortage every year; specifically, surpluses and deficits are actually mutually visible. For example, Ningbo and Shaoxing need the assistance of foreign rice, while Wenzhou and Taizhou have a large outflow every year. Therefore, it can be proved that Zhejiang is a rice-deficient province. The Zhejiang provincial authorities' policy for dealing with this year's food problem is centered on warehousing: the aim is to achieve the goal of "Zhejiang people eating Zhejiang rice." Therefore, the province's agricultural warehouse business is divided into three categories: (1) Provincial agricultural warehouses, (2) County agricultural warehouses, (3) Township warehouses. The construction of provincial agricultural warehouses is funded by the provincial authorities borrowing 400,000 yuan in agricultural warehouse construction loans from the Farmers Bank of China; four provincial warehouses are designated to be built in Jinhua, AoJiang, Haimen, and Xiashi. The loan term is three years, with a weekly interest rate of one percent. Only interest is paid this year, and repayment of principal begins in the twenty-sixth year. Now the loan contract has been approved by the Provincial Payment Conference, and both parties can officially sign it. In terms of county agricultural warehouses, it has been decided to borrow and renovate the original county granaries, and no new warehouses will be built to save expenses. In terms of township warehouses, it is stipulated that the original township warehouses will be temporarily borrowed for use. The number of county, township, and town warehouses in each county is stipulated to be at least one. In addition to the provincial agricultural warehouses, which are stipulated to be completed before the autumn harvest next year, county, township, and town warehouses are all limited to being prepared by the end of September this year for storage and mortgage this autumn. The source of funds for storage and mortgage is also provided by the Farmers Bank of China, and the total amount is said to be 3 million yuan; however, it can be increased at any time depending on the actual needs. However, since the issue of national rice leaking to the sea arose, the authorities drafted nine articles of the "Outline of Measures for Food Adjustment in Zhejiang Province" by the Department of Civil Affairs in order to prevent it from affecting the people's food in Zhejiang Province. It was submitted to the 866th Provincial Government Conference for approval, and the Department of Civil Affairs ordered it to be followed. As a result, the rice destined for various places in Zhejiang was detained in Changdi; the entire food trade in Zhejiang Province was shrouded in the control of the provincial government.</p>
<p>Henan: Henan is also a grain-deficient province. Before the issue of national rice being exported abroad had just sprouted, the Henan provincial authorities, in view of the concern that a large amount of summer-harvested wheat and grain would leak to the sea; therefore, the provincial government passed six articles of the "Temporary Measures for Grain Export from Henan Province" for control. Therefore, this year's grain trade in Henan Province was the first to be managed by the provincial authorities this autumn.</p>
<p>Shandong: Shandong Province has an annual excess of imports of grain; its shortage is self-evident. Since the beginning of autumn this year, the crops in various counties have had a bumper harvest. The people of Shandong are celebrating; but the problem of national rice being exported abroad is becoming increasingly serious. The provincial government has repeatedly received telegrams from coastal counties in Jiaodong; a certain country is instigating unscrupulous merchants to purchase grain for export; and since northern Shandong borders Hebei, it is really unimaginable if strict prohibitions are not imposed! Therefore, on October 20, it was proposed to the Provincial Government Conference to study the measures. As a result, it was decided to hand it over to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments to jointly plan the grain ban policy. Recently, the Provincial Standing Committee has also strictly prohibited the export of grain.</p>
<p>In addition, there are still some provinces; such as Shanxi Province, which, on November 4, instructed the Datong-Puzhou Railway Bureau to prepare vehicles to transport the grain stored in southern Tianjin to Taiyuan. Either because food control has not yet been implemented, or because the region is special, food control cannot be implemented; the former includes provinces such as Fujian and Guangdong, and the latter includes the Hebei-Chahar authorities, which will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>(3) Advantages and Disadvantages of Grain Control Measures</p>
<p>Let us try to look at the provinces that have already implemented food control. Generally speaking, in rice-surplus provinces, the focus is on improving transportation and sales through warehousing policies; in rice-deficient provinces, the focus is on warehousing policies and supervising grain trade. Now, let us discuss their advantages and disadvantages separately. First, let's talk about its advantages:</p>
<p>(1) Prompt Handling: China's food administration has obviously entered a state of discussing without deciding and deciding without acting. For example, the food problem has had a consensus on unified control of transportation and sales for several years; however, it has been entangled in various ways, and the case has not been resolved so far. The new grain has been on the market this time, and grain prices have soared. Although there are many reasons for this; the most terrible thing is that traitors are transporting grain to support the enemy! This kind of problem cannot be compared with ordinary food problems. If emergency measures are not taken to block it; and if it is handled in accordance with the administrative procedures of reporting to the county, the county reporting to the province, and the province reporting to the central government for instructions. It will inevitably delay the people's food supply. It must be known that unscrupulous merchants transporting grain to leak to the sea is a non-public secret operation; the agility of their work can be described as miraculous, making it really difficult to monitor. If it is not resolved quickly on the spot, a large amount of food can be completely lost in an instant! This time, the provinces have adopted this emergency measure to ban grain exports, which is one of the emergency measures.</p>
<p>(2) Local Problems Solved by Local Authorities: The entire food problem in China can be divided into three: (1) Production cannot be self-sufficient, (2) The warehousing system is not prepared, (3) Transportation and sales methods are not good. However, strictly speaking: under the premise of these three food problems, its nature can still be distinguished into two categories: (1) Food problems with national consistency, (2) Local food problems. The former should be solved by the central government's overall planning; the latter must be solved by the local authorities adapting to local conditions. As far as the warehousing and sales policies of various provinces this year are concerned: they are quite worthy of praise. For example, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces are both rice-surplus areas, while Zhejiang is a rice-deficient province; in terms of their local food problems: if the former allows the surplus rice production to flood the market, the rice farmers in the province will inevitably suffer widespread losses due to cheap grain hurting farmers; the latter allows farmers to sell all the rice they have, and they will inevitably suffer the danger of spring famine next year. Therefore, the only solution is to promote the warehousing policy to regulate it. Next, take Hunan as an example: Hunan rice has always been a surplus area; its local food problem is the same as that of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. Now, Hunan Province is improving transportation and sales as a starting point, and selling Hunan rice to Guangdong; its function is also the same as the warehousing policy. For most of the food problems containing locality, it is best to be solved by the local government that is down-to-earth. Solving the local problems that are closely related to the local government has about four benefits: (1) Cost savings, (2) A sense of responsibility, (3) Recognizing the core of the problem, (4) Easy to manage.</p>
<p>The above is the advantage of the food control in various provinces this time; the following will discuss the shortcomings.</p>
<p>(1) Provinces Govern Themselves: Lack of Contact: The biggest drawback of this food control in various provinces is that they only know that the provinces govern themselves and do not know how to contact each other for overall planning. It is obviously very different from the "national unified division of labor and cooperation" method previously advocated by the author. For example, in terms of the sales policy of Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces: since the news of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong has spread, the rice production in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces has mistakenly believed that Guangdong Province is a huge rice warehouse; therefore, they all plan to sell the surplus rice to Guangdong Province to see if it can accommodate the rice from the three provinces. In fact, it is predicted that it will inevitably fail. It must be known that although Guangdong is a rice-deficient province, it is closely connected with rice-producing areas such as Annam and Siam, which are known as the "Granary of the South." According to the customs reports over the years: the import of foreign rice in Guangdong Province accounts for an average of about two-thirds of the total import of foreign rice in the country every year. It can be seen that the people's food in Guangdong Province is still insufficient, but it is not difficult to rely on foreign rice to make up for it. And this time, Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong is no different from taking the market of foreign rice and replacing it. Just imagine whether the countries that produce foreign rice will give up if the original foreign rice market is occupied? If we speculate based on the current situation, there are many hidden reefs in the future! Since the news of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong spread, the price of rice in Changsha has been rising day by day; the provincial government, fearing that it would affect the cost of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong, instructed the counties and cities on October 25 to announce to merchants: to support the plan of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong, and not to take the opportunity to manipulate and violate the sales contract. From this, it can be seen that those who are plotting from it obviously have other intentions; trying to hinder the active progress of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong. The Shantou Grain Industry Association has held meetings many times and publicly opposed it. On the surface, it is an expression of a small number of people who want to manipulate the rice market; but in fact, they have sent people to Hong Kong to contact the North and South Banks to seek solutions. And the North and South Banks have heard that they sympathize with this move; they plan to increase their capital and set up foreign rice transportation and sales offices in Guangzhou and Shantou. And the Huoxi Grain Industry in Saigon and Yangon is also willing to provide backing and support. The Huoxi Grain Industry has a close relationship with the North and South Banks in Hong Kong; the sale of foreign rice to Guangdong over the years has been handled by the North and South Banks on special ships. Now that they are colluding in this way, we really cannot ignore it. It is expected that when Hunan rice enters Guangdong, the price of foreign rice will inevitably fall and be dumped. What's more, the movement to request the reduction and exemption of foreign rice import tax in Guangdong Province continues, this is the second. And according to the latest news from the Roman Telegraph: According to the report published by the International Institute of Agriculture, the area of rice planting in the entire territory of India, including Qingdian, this year is estimated to be about 31,748,000 hectares. According to last year, it increased by 2.8%. (See Shen Bao, November 2) India and Qingdian are also the source of foreign rice supply for our country. With the increase in their production, their surplus grain will inevitably be dumped in China. Guangdong Province is a close neighbor of foreign rice dumping, and of course it will not be abandoned by Indian and Qingdian grain. This is the third. However, let us try to think about the biggest purpose of Hunan rice being sold to Guangdong: to seek the adjustment of Hunan's surplus rice production through transportation and sales, so as not to threaten the tragic decline of Hunan rice prices; so that all Hunan rice farmers can avoid the attack of bumper harvests turning into disasters. Now, due to these various reasons, the result will inevitably outweigh the gains. If we allow Anhui rice and Jiangxi rice to be sold to Guangdong without a plan, it will only help foreign rice to dump and disrupt the market; it will inevitably create a situation where Guangdong has rice but no market. Therefore, this move is good in itself; but before the event, the provinces govern themselves and only know how to blindly promote it, without the overall planning between provinces, I am afraid that the future results will not be optimistic.</p>
<p>(2) Banning Grain Exports is Not Something that Provinces Can Handle: Although the policies of the provinces that are currently implementing grain bans are different, a common point can be found in their implementation of grain ban measures. That is, the provinces that implement grain bans generally focus on banning grain "exports" and focus on supervising "exit from the province." In fact, banning grain from leaking to the sea is a food problem of national consistency, which is definitely not something that a local province can handle. For example, if Province A is implementing a grain ban, while Province B is still freely circulating; those who are slippery will take advantage of the shortcomings of our country's lack of coordination, and transport and leak it repeatedly, then the result will be that those who ban it will ban it themselves, and those who leak it will leak it themselves. This is the first. Although the coastal ports in our country can be strictly blocked: the barriers along the Great Wall in North China have long been lost. If the central government implements a grain ban policy, and the domestic circulation of grain is still not prohibited; but the inflow of grain into North China is different from leaking to the sea for export. From this, we can know that banning grain exports feels very tricky everywhere, this is the second. Under the combination of these two impossible grain bans, the legitimate grain prices in various provinces will inevitably be heavily hindered by the transformation of taxes due to the grain ban. The legitimate rice farmers will make grain as cheap as mud due to rumors spread by traitors. Mutually激盪, the people's food problem of the general public will become more serious due to the implementation of the grain ban.</p>
<p>(3) No Permanence: The final point of the current food control in various provinces is the lack of durability. It must be known that the food problem in our country has been around for a long time; it is definitely not something that can be solved by the temporary response of the provinces recently.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>For the sake of today's plan. In addition to continuing to work hard according to the late Premier's instruction to operate the food purpose "not to redeem money, but to provide for the people"; the author can contribute two food routes in the future at this time, to be used for reference.</p>
<p>(1) The recent implementation of food control in various provinces; its advantages are indeed facts; but its shortcomings cannot be denied by us. If we can improve its shortcomings and utilize its advantages, it will be of some help to the future of the people's food. Therefore, the author advocates the first food route, that is, for the provinces that have recently implemented food control, the various facilities related to the grain trade should be reorganized into grain transportation and sales offices to manage the matter. On the one hand, local food control is used to assist the Central Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau in its work; at the same time, it relies on the consistent food policy of the central government to eliminate the spirit of provincial self-government and lack of coordination.</p>
<p>(2) The indecision of our country's food control is actually due to too much emphasis on the control of the grain trade. The entire food economy includes three categories: production, transportation and sales, and consumption; the current food production is only focused on controlling transportation and sales. However, the control of grain transportation and sales is more difficult to implement; it must be known that those who are currently standing on the side of rice producers are not the majority of food consumers; but a part of the grain financiers and grain dealers. Food control is abandoned after the control of grain production and the consumption of the consumer as a shield, and lonely control of transportation and sales; therefore, its anti-resistance is only seen. Therefore, the author advocates the second food line, that is, the future food control should not be resolved by controlling transportation and sales as a way to solve the problem; but by controlling the production and consumption of food as a starting point. Once the production and consumption of food have a clue, the control of transportation and sales will not be difficult to solve, otherwise, I am afraid that it will be a waste of effort. How can the two words "manage" and "handle" solve the transportation and sales of food? (End)</p>

<p>Last week's public debt market coincided with the last week of December futures. The market process was a process of turning from weak to strong. The initial environment above the cover was the Xi'an Incident, which still tended to be dull. The market sentiment was also extremely weak. The market price was gradually declining due to the mutual rejection of bulls and bears. Therefore, the last day of this month did not lead to fierce crushing. Until the weekend, due to the safe escape of Chairman Chiang, people's hearts were greatly shaken, and the market soared. The atmosphere of weakness suddenly became vigorous, and the trend was also very strong. Today is the beginning of February, and because the situation is suddenly clear, the prospect should continue to have the possibility of progress. The entire week's process is described as follows: Monday was a chaotic day with intense competition between bulls and bears. The market price rose or fell, quite inconsistent, and formed a revolving shape. On Tuesday, the trend continued to be dull, and large households' entry and exit were also quiet (both bulls and bears were busy or升均busy adjusting positions. The market price rose by one or two corners to half a yuan due to brewing. On Wednesday, the news of the situation was still严元, and there were still many spot transactions on the surface. However, the gold industry gradually showed up, and the market price unanimously fell back by one or two corners to eight corners. On Thursday, it was the last day of December futures, and because the market sentiment was weak, large households continued to sell, and retail bulls were also eager to cut their losses. The market situation showed a short squeeze. Friday was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and the market was closed for one day. On Saturday, only January futures were traded. Because of the good news of Chairman Chiang's safe arrival in Luoyang, people's morale suddenly showed excitement, and large households had huge absorption. The market price rose unanimously by one yuan and one corner and a half and one yuan and three corners and a half, and the atmosphere was extremely vigorous. As a result of the entire week, the average of December was lower compared to, and the list is as follows: (Unit effectiveness unit 100 yuan)</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Life is full of sorrow and hardship, yet it is also sweet and bright.</p>
<p>In the course of a person's life history, its development is often not linear, but proceeds in curves. It will inevitably encounter many obstacles and dangers along the way. However, it is precisely perseverance and struggle that break through these heavy obstacles!</p>
<p>It is said that the survival of mankind is always governed by "hope." No matter what kind of person in the world, there is no one who does not hold hope. Indeed, the hopes of some of these people are reasonable, while others harbor extravagant hopes, daydreams, or even absurd fantasies. However, they all rely on their own hope as the basis for survival. It is the same. "Hope is truly the mother of the evolution of human society!</p>
<p>History has determined our fate and placed us in an extremely distressing and turbulent era. To overcome this distress and resolve this turmoil, we not only need courage and sacrifice, but also a clear understanding of the goals of our struggle, a glorious and clear self-confidence, coupled with arduous and unremitting struggle!</p>

<p>— Yang Gong Huai</p>
<p>Huaqing Pool. It was where Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stayed the night before he was kidnapped to Xi'an, located south of Lintong County, on Mount Li. There are hot springs on the mountain. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty built the Tangquan Palace here, and Emperor Xuanzong changed it to Huaqing Palace, further developing the hot spring wells into pools. Yang Guifei (Imperial Concubine Yang) once bathed here, hence Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" contains the line, "In early spring, she was bestowed a bath at Huaqing Pool, where the warm spring waters were smooth and washed away her creamy skin." In front of the pool, there is a wooden archway with the three characters "Huaqing Pool" inscribed on it, written by Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan. Passing through the archway, weeping willows line the path, creating a serene and secluded landscape. The pool is located within Huaqing Park and is managed by the China Travel Service, using the profits to develop Huaqing Pool. The current facilities of the pool are mostly Europeanized. The pool is divided into two: one is a single-person pool, and the other is the Guifei (Imperial Concubine) Pool, both paved with small tiles. The Guifei Pool is larger and can accommodate four people bathing together. It is said that the bathing price is one yuan per person. The single-person pool is slightly smaller, but the facilities and bathing price are the same. The water temperature is suitable, with no sulfur odor, so it is most suitable for bathing. Is this why Huaqing Pool enjoys such a great reputation?</p>
<h3 id="e177">Tofu and Celebrities <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Yuan</p>
<p>When Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, studied in Paris in his early years, he specialized in chemistry. One day, he suddenly thought of tofu, the most nourishing food in China, which had never existed in European countries. He specially wrote a treatise expounding the functions of tofu and published it in the Paris Daily. At the same time, he opened a tofu company in Paris, which caused a sensation among people of all kinds in that area. Everyone wanted to taste it quickly. Therefore, the business of Li's tofu company prospered from this. So, tofu going abroad started with Li. Those who talk about the history of tofu must know this.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Wang Tieshan and tofu, Mr. Feng Yuxiang once published an article "Mr. Wang Tieshan, the First-Class Honest Official of Modern Times" in Yijing, which contains the following passage: We have been together this time for almost a year, and we are simply inseparable at all times. What I admire most is that although he has lived in the officialdom all his life, he has not had the slightest bureaucratic habit. He has several good hobbies, one is that he likes to eat tofu. He often squats on the ground to eat it, and it seems very tasty. People living in the world can have a bowl of tofu to eat, and there is no more happiness. I said to him; In the past, Tang Wenzheng Qian'an of the Qing Dynasty was an official to the rank of governor and governor, and the only dish he ate every day was a plate of tofu, so everyone called him tofu soup. You old man can really be regarded as a confidant of him.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Glass Cup <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"Glass Cup" is a very popular slang term in Shanghai, known to almost everyone. According to the Six Writings, this is a "semantic association." Because the female tea servants who engage in this occupation do not use teapots or teacups, but glass cups. "By extension of the object to the person," they have the moniker "Glass Cup."</p>
<p>The origin of "Glass Cup" can be traced back to the Immortal World ten years ago. - Located at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road, it has been closed for many years. - At that time, because the style was novel and quite stimulating, it caused a sensation throughout Shanghai and captivated many frivolous youths. At that time, tourists with "Drunken Old Man" intentions would throw out a one-yuan tip for a cup of tea, still considered skinflint customers in their eyes. Tipping ten or five yuan for a cup of tea, joking around, hoping to achieve special purposes, was not a big deal. Because of the abundant income, it was not easy to seek this occupation at that time. In addition to being beautiful and young, they also had to have a special means of winning over tourists.</p>
<p>Subsequently, various entertainment venues followed suit, and female tea servants poured in like "carp crossing the river," with all kinds of appearances, ages, and colors. Their careers were not as good as before. For the sake of the environment and life, some of them had no choice but to engage in special transactions. This is not a slander by the author. At least six or seven out of ten are engaged in this transaction. If you don't believe it, look at the pink cases and rape and murder incidents in the newspapers. Female tea servants account for a considerable number.</p>
<p>Speaking of their lives, it's also quite pitiful. Their tea-making places are always contracted by a boss. In addition to providing a meager dinner, the boss has to pay a tea fee of two cents for each cup of tea brewed. The remaining income is enjoyed under his name. If there are few tea-making guests, or they only eat soup dumplings, then they will also be subjected to the boss's cold sarcasm. Therefore, female tea servants with slightly poorer appearances and less skillful flirting methods often complain about their miserable lives, shouting that it is difficult to eat.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Pears of Zunhua <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yiren</p>
<p>Every year when it comes time to eat "pears," I always think of the "Buddha's Delight" pear that I ate in Zunhua County, Hebei Province.</p>
<p>"Buddha's Delight" is a special product of Zunhua. When it is sold everywhere, it is collectively called "Tianjin Pear." In fact, there are not so many real "Buddha's Delight" pears. At the same time, it is indeed more delicious than other pears.</p>
<p>"Buddha's Delight" is a sweet, crisp, tender, and delicate Ya pear. Especially the kind of pear that is eaten on the spot in Zunhua, from the time it is picked from the tree to the stalls for sale, the time elapsed is at most one day. Its freshness is really unmatched by other pears. This point is that those who have not personally visited Zunhua do not enjoy the right to eat fresh "Buddha's Delight."</p>
<p>The meaning of the sign "Four Seasons Fresh Fruits" at Shuiye shop is to prove that fruits are most delicious when they are fresh. Therefore, Zunhua's "Buddha's Delight" loses its color once it is transported out of the country. Therefore, you can hardly hear the name "Buddha's Delight" in other places.</p>
<p>When the author was in Zunhua, whenever I was free, I planned to buy pears to eat. My clumsy skill of cutting pears was very pure. Every time I cut off a thin layer of cooked skin, before I even put down the knife in my right hand, I couldn't help but send the jade-like pear in my left hand to my mouth. A mouthful of nectar and jade dew poured into my heart. It really made people anesthetized and unwilling to stop. At the same time, cutting and eating like this was also an economical pastime. Because "Buddha's Delight" only sells for two or three copper coins each locally, it is cheap and good, which is truly worthy of its name.</p>
<p>In one spring, I stayed in a small town "Tiechang Town" more than sixty miles east of Zunhua City for more than a month. When I was free, I would take a walk in the suburbs. When I saw a garden, I would go in and take a look. There were large kinds of pear trees planted there, which were blossoming with snow-white flowers. There were also vines spreading with grape vines. I put myself in this forest of white flowers and green leaves, and I lingered and didn't want to come out. The owner of the garden also said to me with a look of encouragement: "Please come and play in the autumn and eat 'Buddha's Delight'." It's a pity that I couldn't even wait for a summer before I left Tiechang Town, and even said goodbye to the entire Zunhua. Recalling the past, I can't help but feel lost!</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever pears are sold on the market, I am reminded of the scene of eating pears at that time.</p>
<p>I think of "Buddha's Delight", I miss Zunhua where "Buddha's Delight" is produced.</p>
<h3 id="e180">People of Suiyuan <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Li Wei</p>
<p>A Er is a waiter in the office. He is from ××, Suiyuan. He is tall, has dark skin, and is quite strong. He usually wears a blue jacket, which seems so old that you can't tell its original color. A line of grease often shines on the collar and cuffs. This is not because he doesn't like cleanliness, but because his economy forces him to do so! Our colleagues treat him very well; he is not only careful in his work, but also able to endure hardship; sometimes when we want something, he knows what it is without us telling him.</p>
<p>However, ever since the war in Suiyuan broke out, his movements have become dull and slow, and under his constantly furrowed eyebrows, his two large, black eyes often emit a fierce light. We knew that he was terrified of the destruction of his hometown and sympathetically forgave him, but the pain he now felt was that he was illiterate and could not read the newspaper to know the outcome of the war.</p>
<p>Every morning, he brought the newspaper in, as if all his strength was used in his hands. He watched us silently reading the newspaper, not knowing what today's news was? He was just anxious beside him, sometimes he couldn't bear it, so he walked gently to my side, his voice trembling slightly, and asked me softly:</p>
<p>"Li Xiansheng, have we won another battle?"</p>
<p>About a few days ago one morning, I told him that on the morning of the 24th, our army had occupied Bailing Temple, which was a very important place for the bandits to entrenched themselves. When he heard my words at the time, a look of joy immediately appeared on his face; and he kept telling us about the customs and scenery of Suiyuan, and finally said: "The people of Suiyuan are very strong and not afraid of the cold. The weather there is so cold that the ears and noses will fall off." These words often made my colleagues listen with great interest.</p>
<p>Now we haven't seen him smoking for a long time, we asked him what the reason was? He replied to us like this:</p>
<p>"Sirs, you all take money to donate to fight the war, but I have no money and I can't be hungry every day and save the money for meals to help. So I have to quit smoking, and I have more than two yuan a month! And I decided to save it like this, and I must wait until these bandits and devils are wiped out and the war stops before stopping. After he finished speaking, a look of courage and hope appeared on his face, which really moved us. All the colleagues in the whole world, wake up, this is a critical moment of life and death!</p>

<p>Youmei smiled and said: So it seems that cousin also regards me as a literary confidante. As she spoke, she glanced at Guoqi, and immediately shook her hands together, smiling: I can't reach that high. Guoqi said: Once Miss Li becomes polite, she feels that everything is polite. Youmei smiled: This is not politeness. There is a saying that a real sword is given to a martyr, and beauty is given to a beauty. Giving something to someone means raising them up as something noble. Cousin gave me magazines, which means he often regards me as a lover of literature. Guoqi said: Can Miss Li still say that she is not a lover of literature? If you are not a lover of literature, you may not care about such idle matters as mine. Anyone who cares about this kind of thing has a bit of a bookish air. Youmei pursed her lips and smiled, twisted her body and said: I am a fool, a fool. But I am not qualified to add the word book. Guoqi has never had the courage to talk to women. Talking face-to-face with Youmei like this is partly because she is very forthright and does not have the shyness of a girl, and partly because they are relatives and have seen each other often. It was not difficult to say the serious entrustment or words of gratitude before, but now that they are gradually talking about jokes, he feels speechless again. So he also took a folding fan from the bookshelf and slowly fanned it in front of his chest. The room was extremely quiet, and the bamboo curtain hanging outside the window was shaking slightly, making a rustling sound. Youmei put her eyes on the books on the bookshelf, as if she was paying close attention to something, and then smiled: Cousin, most of the books on this bookshelf are about poetry. Guoqi said: It can't be said that there are many. I don't know that compared to the books on that bookshelf, there are a few more books about poetry. Youmei said: Cousin's poems are very well written. I will send a folding fan over and ask cousin to inscribe two lines of poetry on it, okay? Guoqi said: I can't write poetry... the next sentence of refusal. Before he could say it, Youmei turned her eyes and quickly shot him a glance. Guoqi had no choice but to hold back his words and immediately changed his tone and said: If Miss Li is not afraid that I will spoil the fan, then you can bring it. Youmei heard these words, as if she had obtained something desirable, narrowed her eyes and smiled on the bookshelf. Guoqi didn't know what her purpose was in coming here today. If it was to convey a message from Jiang Meng, this time it was completely irrelevant. (115)</p>
<p>Character Sketches</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Few Stories of "Paying Attention Only to Clothes" <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Zhaolun, who is now the head of the Department of Chemistry at Peking University, used to be the head of the Department of Chemistry at National Central University in Nanjing. Mr. Zeng has always been a practitioner of "native cloth doctrine" and looks like a country bumpkin. Once, National Central University held a school affairs meeting. The new president had just arrived and did not know Mr. Zeng. Coincidentally, only the new president and Mr. Zeng were on time for the meeting in the meeting room. After the president sat down, he thought that he was an impolite tea boy and ordered him to go out. Mr. Zeng calmly withdrew and said, "Since you invited me, you want me to leave again, that's really a joke." The president heard these words and knew that things were not good. After inquiring, he asked the tea boy to invite him again to attend the meeting. But this Zeng did not go, only instructed the tea boy to reply to the president: "I will wait until I go to Shanghai to change my clothes and then we will meet." The president was embarrassed and deeply ashamed of his negligence, so he entrusted many famous people to explain to Mr. Zeng again and again. Although no problem occurred later, it seemed that this president never got Mr. Zeng's understanding.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Yongni, the current Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is not only a geologist admired by the world, but also a consistent practitioner of frugality. When the Central Government intended to invite him to serve as Minister of Education but he declined last year, he went to Nanjing from Peiping and stayed at the Central Hotel. One day at noon, a certain minister invited him to dinner at his official residence. He wore a half-new, half-old silk robe, took a rickshaw, and went to the banquet calmly. How could he know that the doorman in the minister's official residence was used to seeing guests in cars and fancy clothes, plus there was no wealthy guest named Weng in their minds, so they kept him in the reception room for more than ten minutes, and said with a contemptuous tone: "Friend! Do you want to see the minister? There is something going on today, so I won't see guests. Come again in a few days." Mr. Weng thought that since everyone had something to do and could not keep the appointment, he had no choice but to go back. So he returned to the hotel without saying anything and asked the tea boy to prepare a meal for himself. Later, after one o'clock in the afternoon, the minister's phone call came to urge him, and he explained that he had invited the ministers to accompany him and had already arrived, etc. At this point, Mr. Weng suddenly understood, but he had no choice but to explain the situation. After hearing this, the minister was so embarrassed that he was speechless and had no choice but to apologize in person, but Mr. Weng never cared.</p>
<p>Director Cheng, who is in charge of a certain bureau in Shanghai, once wore a newly made cloth dress to a dinner party at the home of a certain famous person. After entering the door, he hesitated because he did not know the host. Coincidentally, a big man who looked like a cabinet member came to meet him. Without asking anything, he greeted him and said, "You are here." He followed him in and saw a small room with tea and cigarettes mixed together, and the layout was not bad. He casually ate something. Later, he felt that he had not seen the host and there were no acquaintances, so he greeted the people sitting with him, only to learn that these people were all followers and bodyguards of a certain member or a certain director. The director knew that he had misunderstood and had no choice but to leave quickly. Finally, he found the host and had dinner with the official guests.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Discussing the "Love Suicide" Incident of Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>When it comes to the secrets between men and women, newspapers always have information worth exaggerating and vividly describing. Not to mention the so-called "love suicide," which is both tragic and intensely sensational?</p>
<p>Students studying in Japan, Zhu Zucai and Xue Yingzhi, attempted "love suicide" in Mihara, Japan, but failed. Two days later, the woman tried to commit suicide by taking poison in a Yokohama hotel. This kind of thing is actually quite common. However, it is said that Mihara has historically been a famous place for "love suicides" in Japan, and this is the first time Chinese people have patronized it. This is the first point worth exaggerating. Furthermore, the reason Zhu and Xue wanted to commit "love suicide" this time, besides the obvious reason of "love," is said to be because they were deeply saddened by the chaos in the country and the kidnapping of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This reason is frighteningly noble. Who wouldn't respectfully stand at attention upon hearing of dying for the country? However, would "love suicide" by two people actually help rescue Chiang Kai-shek? Moreover, the reason of "love suicide" stemming from being saddened by national affairs is too difficult for people to understand. Chinese people like to put on airs. There's a joke: When the owner's wife of a tofu shop dies, the epitaph reads: "Awarded the title of Imperial Tutor and Grand Secretary of the Cabinet to the Honorable Consort's Next-Door Tofu Shop Owner's Wife, Madame XX." This is a satirical fable, and such a thing may not actually happen, but to attach the honorable term "dying for the country" to what is merely a love suicide is no different from the tofu shop owner's wife's epitaph usurping the title of the consort. I find it quite distasteful.</p>
<p>Even if it were truly for love, why resort to "love suicide"? The fulfillment of love is originally meant to bring joy to life, yet now people are choosing death for it. Some might say: this is Japanese culture. There are countless things we can learn from Japan, yet we insist on imitating this unproductive behavior. Is this really the purpose of studying in Japan? We truly feel heartbroken. Year after year, so-called overseas students go abroad, and over the decades, there must be hundreds of thousands of them. But to this day, we haven't seen many overseas students make any special contributions to China. On the contrary, those who can truly do something beneficial in China are not necessarily overseas-educated students. Of course, we cannot deny that there are some outstanding talents among overseas students, but their number is too small. It seems that they have let themselves and the country down.</p>
<p>A friend who recently returned from Japan said that in Tokyo's nightlife, including dance halls and tea houses, two-thirds of the long-term customers are Chinese students. This is probably true. He also said that our friendly nation provides special protection for Chinese students, especially cherishing the sons and daughters who are wealthy and can spend lavishly. It is said that if a problem were to occur between China and Japan and all the students studying in Japan returned home, half of the dance halls and tea houses in Tokyo alone would have to close down. This is such a heartbreaking fact. Although this has no direct relationship with Zhu and Xue's love suicide, it is still worth mentioning.</p>
<p>A muddled life, it seems, can no longer last. One day, a day of flying blood and flesh will come, and it will be judged who can truly stand tall and walk the path of survival, and who will fall into the eighteenth level of hell!</p>
<h3 id="e184">Taoran Pavilion <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>It is quite strange. My residence, which has always been little noticed, has somehow taken a turn. Now, it is not only a topic of casual conversation for people in my hometown after tea and wine, but also evokes dreams and aspirations in the South, the mountain cities, and any place where culture reaches.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? When people travel to Beiping and get off the train, if you ask what good places there are to visit, the answer is almost always the same: the Summer Palace and the Longevity Hill if you go a little further, or Beihai, Zhongnanhai, and Zhongshan Park if you stay closer. If you have a sense of history, they will tell you where Tiananmen is and where Jingshan is, so that travelers can appreciate the magnificent and beautiful scenery, the lush waters and verdant mountains, the residence of the imperial family, which is so enviable!</p>
<p>But the Taoran Pavilion, right near me, is easily placed at the back of their minds. Putting it at the back of their minds is understandable. Reeds and graveyards surround the entire solitary pavilion. If you shout, you will hear only a faint echo, and you will hear no human voice. It quietly allows the years to slip by. Moreover, the "Nanxia Wazi" nearby – the slum – is viewed no differently than the people of Shanghai view the Jiangbei grass shacks. It is messy, filthy, and moldy. In short, it is not a place for high-class people to "glance" at, so why give visitors a bad impression?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just that I was born lowly. From my youth to my childhood, I liked the Nanxia Wazi that people looked down on, and I also liked the quiet and lonely Taoran Pavilion.</p>
<p>In spring, the warmth in the North comes relatively late. During the Qingming Festival, the grass grows and the swallows fly. From my residence at the head of "Nanheng Street," I would turn with two or three companions of similar age and walk onto "Heiyaochang." This street is not long. At its southern end is the "Sansheng Temple," where Sai Jinhua, who once shone brightly in our lives, once stayed. The temple is quite large and elegantly decorated. Further south, the Nanxia Wazi comes into view. The so-called "Wazi" was originally just a lower-lying area with ponds and marshes and few residents. Gradually, those whose livelihoods did not allow them to live within the Forbidden City sought ways to move here. Thus, this place was developed into a special environment. Further down, you pass through a stately pavilion with large doorways at the bottom and a small Buddha enshrined in a small room on the upper floor. The "Yaotai" is like a dirt mountain, dilapidated beyond recognition, standing in front of the pavilion's door. Walking up, you see that several broken temples have damaged walls. In one corner, two leaning shacks have been built, inhabited by two elderly couples. If a strong wind were to come, it could either bury them in the rubble or blow them down along with their houses. In the past, this was a "kiln," with a raging fire burning, sending batches of goods to "Heiyaochang." But the historical sites? They have vanished like passing clouds, leaving only memories of the past! A few years ago, it was said that there were still traces of the filled-in kiln openings, but now they are covered by weeds.</p>
<p>Following the flat road, you pass by reed ponds on both sides. The warm spring breeze ripples through the wilderness, and the sun melts the thick layer of ice. The wrinkles ripple in the direction of the wind, shimmering. The deep-rooted reed seedlings sprout vigorously. Ah, here lies buried our beloved childhood, and it also contains countless historical sites worth reminiscing about—</p>
<p>At the end of the road is Taoran Pavilion. The two gates are always closed. In spring, when the chilly winds have not yet subsided, there are few visitors. When summer comes, unable to bear the heat, people wave their banana leaf fans and stroll in the serene surroundings, one after another, as the sun falls behind Fragrant Hills. If you want to stay longer and sit comfortably for a while, you can go to the pavilion. There is tea and hot towels, and the cost is limited. Standing under the veranda-like corridor and looking south, you see the outer city wall not far away, black and jagged, extending to the city gate tower and then stretching to the distant horizon. The other three sides are reed ponds, with reeds taller than people. Wild birds (bird name) hide here, chirping noisily. The moonlight engulfs the entire wilderness. Take in the magnificent sound of the clams, the surroundings are silent, and a gentle breeze passes by your ear. You can't help but feel a sense of tranquility.</p>
<p>In autumn, the tips of the reeds are covered in grayish-white ears, and the fluff floats, floats. The crickets raise their voices in loud cries. The reed branches rustle, slender and desolate. Slowly, the severe frost erodes their existence, and the pond turns yellow again. Where are the people of Taoran? They have long since stepped onto the heated kang to warm themselves. What remains is the lonely and desolate Taoran Pavilion!</p>
<p>It has been several years since I left that despised place. I never imagined that it would be mentioned again because of a "beauty of a generation." In this harsh winter, I think Taoran Pavilion will not break the dull atmosphere because of the beauty's fragrant tomb, right?</p>
<h3 id="e185">Bridge <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>A bridge is like a stupid person with a hunched back, lying on a flat road, obstructing people, animals, and the winter scenery.</p>
<p>The bridge saves the cooking smoke of broken boats entering the home, but even the rusty tin chimneys cannot reach the bridge and pass under the bridge arch. Look at the broken reed mat hanging on the cabin, fanned by the wind. It's cold. What gives people a sense of warmth is a clay stove for roasting sweet potatoes at the end of the bridge.</p>
<p>The old woman selling roasted sweet potatoes is dressed like children, her cotton-padded jacket is bloated, her shoes are bloated, and her neck is bloated. The children have red cheeks and snot hanging from their noses. They hide under the wall, watching the old woman selling roasted sweet potatoes with greedy eyes.</p>
<p>The northwest wind, carrying ice and snow, grabs the chest of the wall, making a sad hissing sound. The room with the stove is warm, but the children only have frozen black hands and a basket, which will hold the jade scavenged from the garbage mountain.</p>
<p>The old woman selling roasted sweet potatoes stretches out a hand as withered as life itself, picks up the iron tongs, and pulls a well-roasted sweet potato from the stove. A smell of burnt sweet potato emerges from the stove, scattering in the strong and piercing wind.</p>
<p>The children drag their clothes and wipe away the watery snot.</p>
<p>The garbage truck with iron wheels is coming again. The cart puller bends over and climbs over from the other end of the bridge. The children run over in a puff of smoke, helping the old cart puller push the cart to the garbage mountain as if they were welcoming their father.</p>
<p>Greedy black hands grab and sweep on the garbage heap, but it's cold.</p>
<p>The garbage truck is pulled onto the bridge again, and the bridge makes a creaking groan. The bridge is like a stupid person with a hunched back, lying on a flat road, obstructing people, animals, and the winter scenery.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Old Friend <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ji</p>
<p>Whenever I am free and have nothing to do, I have a habit that has not changed for several years: I like to take a book or a few newspapers to a tea house and sit there for an hour or two, read the newspapers, drink a cup of light Longjing tea, watch the people coming and going in the tea house, and savor the happiness of leisure.</p>
<p>Through the glass window, it is gradually getting dark on a cold winter night. The wind must be blowing hard, every pedestrian shrinks their forehead into the collar of their upturned coat, white air coming out of their mouths. The trams are full of people returning home, rumbling past. Hiding myself inside the window and watching the activities of people on the street is a different kind of feeling.</p>
<p>Because it's already past tea time, there are only a few scattered people left here. One table is eating their dinner. Right next to that table full of sugar-fried spare ribs, braised fish head, and oily chicken, I found a face that was extremely familiar, but I couldn't remember his name for a moment. His head was originally lowered, but then he suddenly straightened up and noticed me. The pointed chin, the long face, the prominent nose, only his hair was longer, wasn't this – we both stood up, I walked faster and ran to his opposite, asking him:</p>
<p>"Are you He Zhicheng, a graduate of Provincial Fifth Middle School?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he stretched out his hand and shook mine; I immediately felt that his hand was very thin and cold, and he quickly retracted it. He still remembered me, said my name, and continued, "You're still so young, you haven't changed at all! We, we haven't seen each other for five years, right?"</p>
<p>I nodded and sat down. I may not have changed much, but he has really changed too much. From the lines on his forehead, you could tell how much of the world's hardships he had gone through in the past few years. We lived in the same dormitory when we were in middle school; whenever the night was quiet, we were reluctant to go to sleep and liked to talk about our hopes and grand ambitions. I remember him saying to me: "My most pressing hope right now is to be able to go to Shanghai to study at a university next year, as I wish. Although the environment we are in now is not good, and the current society is dark, we young people must rise up and transform it!" The following year, he did get the opportunity to go to university in the midst of his poverty. We came to Shanghai on the same boat. But after the exam, we were admitted to different schools, so our years of studying together were suddenly separated! At that time, we still met often, still maintaining our youthful innocence, always talking about our ambition to transform society. When we were in our third year of university, the unfortunate news came that his father had passed away in a painful illness, without having the time to see his son succeed! And the burden of the family's livelihood immediately shifted to the shoulders of this 23-year-old youth. At that time, I was traveling in Nanjing, and when I returned to Shanghai, I only received a short letter from him saying that he had decided to go home, but his whereabouts after that were still uncertain... And from then on, he never gave me any news, which made me feel very strange. Now, we have unexpectedly reunited, and he explained to me that people struggling in the torrent of life sometimes really have no opportunity to write letters. I myself am currently in this state, so I understand him very well. He told me that in the past five years, he had been running around, and in order to make a living, he had even been a soldier. The more he talked about his difficult life experiences, the more moved I became.</p>
<p>"Coming to Shanghai, because I didn't know if you were still here – even if you were, I couldn't find out your address, so if we didn't run into each other in the tea house, I'm afraid I wouldn't know when we would meet!" he ended like this.</p>
<p>So, I told him my address and briefly told him about my own life situation.</p>
<p>"It's really getting worse day by day!" We both lamented together.</p>
<p>It was already dark outside, and the city's night was noisy. I saw that it was getting late, and I had to attend a friend's meeting that night, so I said goodbye to him and came out. The cold wind was blowing hard outside, sparse stars were twinkling in the sky, and the big clock on top of a Western-style building was striking nine o'clock – dong, dong, dong... the sound struck my heart with unusual heaviness.</p>

<p>The general glares angrily, eyes wide, wielding a rattan whip, ascending the stairs. Unprepared. I went to Tianjin yesterday because of something. And you, secretly slipped out. Alas, you lowly person. One lash. One curse. The hand waves and the eyes follow, without stopping. But see, snow-white skin and cloud-like hair disheveled. Clothing disheveled, revealing the chest. Fengxi listens. Trembling. Perspiration dripping from head to toe. Ears on the wall will eventually detect. How can there be no eavesdroppers outside the window. Who would have thought, the general, in a fit of rage, heard these words. Suddenly, he sneered a few times. I know everything in your heart. Could it be, a secret rendezvous renewing old feelings. I thought, you were a humble resident of a poor lane. Making a living by singing and playing clappers. Now you haven't changed your usual ways. I'm afraid, your foxy tail will show. I thought you had changed your tune and dressed as a scholar. Transforming into a respectable female student. Coming here, to enjoy wealth and luxury. Dressed in silk and eating delicacies, pleasing your heart. Who knew, your bones were naturally seductive. You couldn't hide the fleeting affair. You actually, secretly put a cuckold's hat on me. Grass and wormwood are not noble. They are like roadside willows, wall flowers, and wild grasses. How can a swallow produce a phoenix? Of course, you are not destined to be a lady.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Roar! China" (Written by Chen Shaomin) The beautiful land of China for five thousand years. Founding the nation, dominating East Asia, at the center. Today, the countryside is bankrupt, the city is emaciated. Internal and external troubles are pressing in. Under iron hooves, the strong enemy arbitrarily destroys our land. Overwhelming oppression is truly unbearable. Might even extinguishes justice. The beautiful divine land has come to this. How many are the brave children of China? Aspiring to save the nation today. Urgent. Difficult. Unrepentant in dedicating oneself to the country. Smiling as you go to the battlefield. For justice. For peace. A hundred battles, a hundred victories, establish the great. We would rather break our heads. Than change our will. Not killing the enemy. Swear not to return. Willing to donate our heads for the nation. Not afraid of the enemy's guns and cannons. From now on, emulate the former sages and sleep on firewood and taste gall. Long-term resistance requires unity. Do not be indecisive and fickle. How can you love yourself when your country is destroyed? Jade and stone burned together is truly unbearable. I urge you all, love your family, first love your country. Preserving every inch of land is the top priority. Living in peace and working happily is what everyone desires. When that time comes, the world will be for the public to freely discuss. World peace and national prosperity will come.</p>

<p>Speaking of Jin Yan, it can be said that there is no one who does not know him. Indeed, Jin Yan's impression on the screen is very deep. It is not an exaggeration to say that he earned the highest praise of "Movie Emperor" among all Chinese male actors, and it is definitely not accidental, which shows that he has true talent. Now, in "Soaring Ambitions," playing Shun'er, his vigorous performance and powerful actions profoundly express the heroic nature of a resolute and decisive youth, with astonishing success.</p>
<p>Wang Renmei Just like Jin Yan, Ms. Wang Renmei is also a movie actor that you cannot forget. In the past, Ms. Wang has always been loved by the audience for her innocent and wild performances. Since her marriage, it was generally thought that she would change her style, but actually not at all. In this "Soaring Ambitions," she plays a strong and spicy wild girl. Perhaps because she has more rich experience in life, she performs the role of Black Girl even more skillfully.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong It would not be wrong to crown Wang Cilong with the title of "Veteran General" of the silver screen. Wang Cilong is truly a versatile person in the film industry. For more than ten years, he has always been working hard for his future, and never slackens because of the rise of talented younger generations. In "Soaring Ambitions," he plays a traitor, and through his calm and experienced acting skills, he vividly portrays the treacherous and cunning demeanor of the traitor, making people really feel that he is a bad guy.</p>
<p>Han Langen The only clown on the current film scene. The fact that his comedic actions contain the serious meaning of life is the unique aspect of Mr. Han's acting skills. In "Soaring Ambitions," he plays a cowardly youth who is generally considered to be unsuccessful, but in the end, he makes a great sacrifice to protect the national flag. The profoundness of his acting is truly thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Tian Fang It has been a long time since we parted ways with Tian Fang after "Good Land". That's right, Mr. Tian's ambition is worthy of our praise. He knows that his acting skills are not yet outstanding, so he has been silent, but striving for the cultivation of his art. Now, in "Soaring Ambitions," he makes a comeback, and he has indeed given us great satisfaction. He plays Tian Dehou, a youth who transforms from selfish and self-interested to heroic sacrifice, and expresses several layers of personality, without any laxity that we can criticize.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Four Major Stars Co-Star in "The Wife Stealer" <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>As the New Year approaches, amidst this atmosphere of universal joy, the Nanjing Grand Theater's contribution to the honor of Shanghai residents is the public screening, starting January 1st of next year, of MGM's exceptionally humorous blockbuster, "The Wife Stealer." This film is a great comedy co-starring four radiant stars from Hollywood. The cast includes the passionately romantic Jean Harlow, star of "Suzy," the witty and humorous William Powell, star of "Miss China," the expressive Myrna Loy, star of "The Great Ziegfeld," and the ruggedly straightforward Spencer Tracy, star of "Fury." With four major stars co-starring in one film, its value is evident. The story is extremely fresh and touching, centering around a man "borrowing" a wife as the core of the entire film. From this starting point, countless branches and layers of humor arise. During the New Year's holiday season, this film is truly a must-see for Shanghai movie fans.</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Word on "Street Angel" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Muzhi, the director and screenwriter of "Street Angel," says: The theme and style of this story are completely different from his "Cityscape." In "Street Angel," there isn't a single character wearing beautiful clothes; the story is entirely a sketch of the lives of people at the very bottom of society.</p>
<p>"Street Angel" features singers, news vendors, barbers, musicians, children buying pears, prostitutes, procuresses, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e194">"The Adventures of Robin Hood" Star Errol Flynn <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Heroic Posture in the New Film "The Adventures of Robin Hood"</p>
<p>"Street Angel" contains two songs, imitations of folk songs, "Crying for the Seventh of July" and "Intimate [Missing Text] Read and Get [Missing Text]". Tian Han wrote the lyrics.</p>
<p>Zhao Huishen plays a prostitute who has been forgotten, having lived a life of flesh for many years. She is a portrayal of the many women wandering the streets, despised by people. Wei Heling has great sympathy for her.</p>
<p>Street angels live nocturnal lives. Since filming began, director Yuan Muzhi has been working until dawn every night.</p>
<p>"Street Angel" recently borrowed the Xiaoyao Bathhouse to film a bathing scene, offering many gimmicks.</p>
<h3 id="e195">China United Broadcasting <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>"China United Symphony" is a masterpiece of collaboration by all directors and stars of China United. It has now been completed and will premiere in Shanghai on New Year's Day in the 26th year [of the Republic, likely 1937]. The entire film is divided into eight parts, directed by eight people. Their order is: Situ Huimin's "Two Pennies," Fei Mu's "Spring Boudoir Broken Dream," Tan Youliu's "Stormy Night," Shen Fu's "Trio," He Mengfu's "Moonlit Sketch," Zhu Shilin's "Grandson's Ghost", Sun Yu's "Lunatic's Rhapsody" and Cai Chusheng's "Little Five Heroes."</p>
<p>"Little Five Heroes" is one of the liveliest and longest segments of "China United Symphony," with more than two hundred child actors joining in cameo roles. It is anticipated [Missing Text], co-starring child stars Wen Nannan, Cao Weidong, Ge Zuozhi, Tang Zhenbao and Miao Zhenyu, all lively, innocent, clever and lovely.</p>
<p>Fei Mu's "Spring Boudoir Broken Dream" uses sound and music entirely to represent dialogue. Although the actors in the entire segment do not speak, it never feels like anything is missing. Its transcendent design and novel concept are unprecedented.</p>
<p>He Mengfu's segment "Moonlit Sketch" is entirely composed by musician Sha Mei, with six-part chorus. It is performed and voiced by Lang Yuxiu, completely filled with Chinese flavor, with the sentimental air of a poet, like a short essay from the Qi Liang period.</p>
<p>"A Match Made in Heaven" features a scene of the Zhong Qin Factory, operated by Liu Jiqun, which is large in scale, accommodating two thousand workers, bustling and lively. Han [Missing Text] Langan once owned a bank and invented a chicken farming method. Using scientific methods to raise chickens, the eggs laid were ten inches in diameter and weighed ten pounds, the largest eggs in the world.</p>
<p>In Sun Yu's new work "Spring Returns to the World," the trench scene used Studio One and Studio Two connected in haste. Because of its ingenious design, it looked desolate. In order to achieve realism, the City Security Team was specially asked to lend four machine guns and more than five hundred rifles, firing live ammunition, the sound of gunfire thundering, and bullets like rain. Cameraman Huang Shaofen almost didn't dare to step forward to film.</p>
