<p>時評</p>
<h3>蒙德婁會議閉幕</h3>
<p>討論土耳其海峽設防問題的蒙德婁會議。自從上月二十二日開幕以來。經過若干時的停頓與無數决的爭辯。現在已經功德圓滿地閉幕了。新海峽公約於昨晚十時在蒙德婁城簽字。其主要內容的有下列幾點。（一）各國商船不論在平時或戰時。都得自由通過。（二）非黑海沿岸各國所屬軍艦得在平時駛入海峽。或在黑海停留。但以三萬噸為限。不過潛水艇與航空母艦。一律不許通過海峽。（三）在戰爭時期。中立國所屬軍艦得以自由通過。但以土耳其亦為中立國為條件。至各交戰國所屬軍艦則不許通過梅峽。不過因執行國聯行政院命令或因履行區域公約。而此項區域公約已由土耳其簽字加入者。不在此例。（四）土耳其認為有戰爭危險時得任便禁止外國軍艦通過海峽。（五）撤消海峽國際管理委員會。（六）新公約簽字後。土耳其卽得在海峽兩岸。重行設置防禦工事。</p>
<p>蒙德婁會議的圓滿結果與新公約的締成。實是土耳其外交的絕大勝利。因為洛桑條約中關於侵害士國主權的所有規定。在新公約中都已一掃而光。試舉其重而大者說。洛桑條約規定韃靼尼爾與博斯破魯斯海峽二岸解除武裝及海峽由特設的國際委員會管理。而新的則准許士國在海峽二岸設防並撤消國際管理委員會。洛桑條約規定在戰爭時期。如士耳其為中立國時。各國各種戰艦。除受平時之噸位限制外。仍可日夜自由通過。這所謂各國。自然也包含交戰的國家在內。而新的則規定戰時各交戰國家的軍艦。除了履行國聯盟的與區域協定之義務外。一律不准通過。洛桑條約規定在戰爭時期。如土耳其為交戰國時。中立國的軍艦仍可自由通過。而新的則不許中立國軍艦自由通過。新的又規定不許潛水艇與航空母艦通過海峽。軍用機亦不許飛過海峽之上。拿新公約與洛桑條約相比。土耳其已在蒙德婁會議中獲得很大的勝利了。</p>
<p>新公約的締成。不但是土耳其的勝利。而且也是蘇聯的勝利。蘇聯一向贊助土國之海峽設防的要求。而對於戰時封鈹海峽與黑海艦隊自由開入地中海一點。堅持允力。在這次蒙德婁會議中。曾為了這個問題。同英國發生嚴重的衝突。幾至會議破裂。不歡而散。蘇聯之所以堅持在戰時封銷海峽。是因為藉此可以鞏固其第一道的國防陣綫。而英國之所以反對戰時封鎖海峽與黑海艦隊自由開入地中海。是想在戰時可發揮其地中海的海軍力量。把大隊軍艦開入黑海。早日撲滅其可能的敵人。同時其地中海的覇權。可不受蘇聯黑海艦隊的威脅。不過後來由於法國的調解與英國的讓步。蘇聯的主張終於獲得了最後的勝利。</p>
<p>英國之所以對蘇聯讓步。大部的原因。可以說是由於意國的拒絕參加會議。意國對於土國的恢復海峽設防。因為本身利害的關係。是取反對態度的。英國原希望國聯决議撤消對意制裁後。意國能參加蒙德婁會議。同它採取共同的態度。可是意國不但主張非把所有的對意制裁辦法（如地中海海軍互助協定）撤消後。不能參加國際會議。而且還與德國勾結。拉攏德奧訂立親善協定。在這種情形下。英國如果堅持自己的主張。則不但蒙德婁會議不能成功。而且對於以合法手段要求修改條約的行動。也給以很大的打擊。這不啻間接鼓勵德國的片面廢的。破壞國際法治的秩序。因此種種關係。英國就毅然對蘇讓步。而蒙德婁會議也就急轉直下而得圓滿成功了。</p>
<p>蒙德婁會議的經過與結果。不但對於近東和平有重大的貢獻。而且也增厚了集體安全制度的力量。這於想在近東伸展勢力的意國與素以反蘇聯的前錄自命的德國。自然是一個很大的打擊。蒙德婁公約簽定以後。行見歐洲的侵略陣綫與和平陣綫的分野。更有明顯的表現。而未來大屠殺的爆發。也將更形迫近一步了。</p>

<h3>陳濟棠下野前　最後掙扎之一幕　謀召集非常會議組新政府　陳李宣誓就聯軍正副司令　電港邀蔣蔡重編十九路軍　韶州無戰事桂軍調到北江</h3>
<p>廣州通信、自二中全會議決免陳濟棠本兼各職、同時撤銷西南執行部　及政務會兩機關後、陳與桂之李白、初仍擬作最後掙扎、並欲乘機發展西南新局面、在政治方面、計畫新設抗日救國政府、西南執行部及政委會、業於十五日發出宣言內容、否認二中全會各議案、而由留粵各中委、在廣州召開中央執監委員非常會議、召集海外內各執監開會、擬倣照前四屆中委在粵　召開非常會議辦法、除中委外、各地代表、均歡迎參加、十七日、西南執行部及政務會開會議、議決尅日組織非常會議秘書處、着手籌備、非常會議開會日期、擬定八月一日、各省代表招待所、於開會前成立、通告海外內及各省各機關團體、趕速開會、選定出席非常會議代表、粵省各界團體接到通函後、曾有召集會議推　選代表之舉、該項非常會議召集之用意、卽欲產生抗日救亡國民政府、非常會議主席入選、陳濟棠屬意於蕭佛成、但蕭氏近以夙疾復發、數天前業已離粵赴港、陳因特派林翼中張任民二人赴港敦勸蕭氏回粵、結果不得要領、惟陳李白是時對於組府之進行、堅欲硬幹到底、而不知陳已不能久支矣、</p>
<p>當此之時、陳李白已組織抗日救國軍第一第四集團軍聯軍總司令部、在石井兵工廠設立聯軍總　部行營、委張國元為辦公廳主任、陳李二人則於十六日上午十一時、在西南政委會大禮堂舉行宣誓、就一四集團軍聯軍總　副司令職、是日、觀禮者有粵桂長官數百人、政委會派劉蘆隱為監誓員、行禮如儀、陳李並作誓詞、誓畢、監誓員致訓詞、次由陳李分致答詞、於是就職一幕告終、</p>
<p>陳李白同時又謀充厚力量、迭與前十九路軍將領蔣光鼐·蔡廷鍇磋商當林翼中張任民赴港　勸蕭佛成回粵時、並順訪蔣蔡急欲恢復十九路軍、十七日西南政務委員　會且正式電香港邀蔣蔡出任艱鉅、至關於恢復十九　路軍所有兵士、完全以桂省民團改編、餉項則由粵省負担、該項預備成軍之桂省民團、亦已有由桂源源到粵、為數約一萬五千人、誠不料此舉終成畫餅也、</p>
<p>軍事方面、十八日以前、江北最為緊張、蓋此路為余漢謀部入粵必經之　孔道、陳濟棠軍之駐韶州樂昌一帶者、節節引退、並未與余部接觸、外傳韶州已發生戰事、實屬不確、但粵漢鐵路　廣韶段日夜軍運之忙、則為向所少見、又陳李白之計畫、初決縮短防綫、以期作長期負隅、故先後將駐韶關之粵軍撤至英德　清遠　江口源潭軍田翁源一帶、而以桂軍任北江作戰之前鋒、翁照垣師萬餘人、迅調來粵助戰、十五日夜、由桂省取道粵小北江　開赴樂昌、以迄韶州、而桂軍第四十四師王贊斌部、另周祖冕一師、則取道梧州、溯西北東下、由三水開至英德以上、以迄馬壩烏石韶州以南、任西南抗日軍之先頭部隊、但韶城自陳濟棠軍各師於十五　晚撤退後、陷於恐慌時期亘一夜、至十六日晨、余漢謀部第一師始率隊入城、布告安民、故此次韶關、並無戰事發生、可謂幸矣、</p>
<p>東江之陳濟棠軍、亦將取內綫防禦戰略、閩邊粵第四軍第三軍已放棄　閩粵邊防地、卽將集重兵於興甯、連平和平、策應北江軍事、然而各軍將士皆厭惡內戰、故延至十八晚、陳濟棠終不能不下　野離粵、一時緊張之粵局、於此亦卽趨於緩和矣、</p>
<h3>華北走私　將有解決途徑　到濟私貨日益減少</h3>

<h3>南巡假話</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>畲民的生活狀况</p>
<p>假如你先去金華麗水各縣育嬰所去參觀、同樣的會使你大吃一驚、好像世間眞有了「女兒國」、不然那裏怎麼不輕易發現小男孩呢、再到鄉下去打聽、「女兒是賠本貨」的詛罵聲、以及一「重男輕女」的資料、更是美不勝收、接着就要使你惻然動心、恨不能起前人而鞭問、為什麽要用許多不近情理　的禮教、以束縛沉溺女性的命運、竟到這步田地、</p>
<p>可是常此提倡女權、高唱入雲的年代、果想進一步而把踐踏在惡俗下的鄉村婦女、實際的解放出來、那麼「禮失求諸野」、只消就近去請教避居山隅的畬民、因為在他們　那個特殊的　社會裏、不獨不會發現「重男轻女」的现象、相反的還得欣賞着女子康壯活躍的能力、</p>
<p>浙東的畬民、是由福建廣東流徙來的、漢人在浙東雖不敢說是土生土長、但至少是比他們先來千百年、所以漢人　才又稱　他們為「畬客」、浙東本來多山地、少平原、眞所謂「後來居上」的畬民、當然只好挈族上山、山地崎嶇難耕、不得不勉盡人力、去和自然奮鬥、於是反養成了他們堅忍耐勞的習性、和保持兩性間平均發展能力的機會、現在麗水縉雲泰順宣平各縣、崇川峻嶺中、都成了他們聚族而耕、以滋以息的世界、甚至永康蘭谿義烏的鄉下、也漸有他們的蹤跡、這不是偶然的事、</p>
<p>畬民的體貌　習俗和言語、都與漢民不同、衣服裝飾、男的與漢人差不多、婦女卻大相不同、通常她們赤着腳、穿着滾邊鞋、打着布裏腿（俗稱絞腳、）走路矯捷之狀、可與士兵媲美、腰圍青布裙、胸襟鑲着很寬的白邊、另夾上兩條紅緣、看着特別的耀眼、未出嫁的女子、頭上祗圍着青布巾、已嫁的婦人、頭上便帶着竹筒式的帽子、約有三寸長短、中間空虛、外包紅呢、再嵌以銀邊、和前後釘上銀　、挿上銀簪、掛上珠串、全副打扮、價值五六元、族姓尊卑的區別、就看那竹筒的高低來做標準、（藍雷兩姓較高、鐘婁等姓次之、）髮髻梳盤於頭頂、嵌上那頂竹筒帽、顫巍巍的怪惹人注意、有人說、這是一種被征服民族的遺痕、因為那樣的裝束、很像被戰勝的民族、强迫呌她們梳成那樣的頭髻、以便隨時抓提之用、但她們則說這是以前皇帝的恩賜、</p>
<p>住食問題、比當地普通戶農、却尋不出多少異點、小康之家、却住瓦房、貧窮戶多住草屋、吃的以雜糧為主、逢年節祭祀、才間或吃米、此外雖與烟酒結不解緣　的很多、但紅丸毒品、却畏若蛇蝎、這不是法令的森嚴、實際是不曾聞過　媒介物雅片　的香味、</p>
<p>婚姻實行一夫一妻制、因為男女地位平等、社交比較公開、解決還不覺有什麽大困難、同姓不在五服之內、可以結婚、儀式簡單、不尚財帛、女子出嫁、由父母聊備筵席、邀請至近的親族、並選父母雙全的女伴、和新娘共食送別席、新娘坐在席上、須如泣如訴的唱着一種歌曲、以示惜別、母親依依難捨、有的情不自禁、竟至泣不成聲、但新娘為了女友的打趣、或因人作弄來迎娶她的新郎、忍不住心花怒放、反會破啼為笑、土人有一首兒謠、「山裏山、灣裏灣、蘿　開花結牡丹、牡丹娘子要嫁人、石榴娣娣做媒人、媒人到、好商量、轎夫到、哭爹娘、上轎哭三聲、下轎拜觀音、」這正是形容這深山幽谷的佳人、出嫁時喜在眉頭笑在心的韻事、</p>
<p>新娘到了婆家、雖也有祭祖宴客的事、但都很簡單、不事鋪張、三朝以後、她便把家務和農事、很爽快地担負起來、懷孕快要臨盆、產子不到彌月、倘正遇着農忙、她們依然纏好裏腿、去幹劳作、男子反多坐享清福、抱抱孩子、很多蒙藏两族、「男治内女治外」的形態、但因交通較便、常到城市做買賣的、為了生存競爭並習化於漢俗的關係、已逐漸改變、而成為兩性共同勞作、共同享樂了、</p>
<p>女子當任耕種勞作的能力、因為並不遜於男子、所以婚後生兒育女、便無輕重愛憎之分、老年無子有女、可以招壻、連女子也不生一個、便向他人保養、撫育一如己出、俟大了一樣招壻、但在彼族社會組織機構中、女子占有生產經濟的重要地位、保養人家的小娣娣、比保養小寶寶有時還難、不客氣的說、因為男孩大了、多數反成了好吃懶做的廢物啊、在這樣畸形的狀態下、我不到同族的女孩、於是城裏有名無實的育嬰所、便是他們選抱珠兒的目的地、而那些女兒國的許多小生命、也只企望他們來做救命菩薩、女兒招壻立家、改姓登譜入族、就有財產繼承權、不幸丈夫早死、孀婦可自由改嫁、獨媳婦當然更可續贅、並無須單方面的守節、</p>
<p>畬民職業、以務農為本、間以飼猪打麻為副業、經營商業的、絕無僅有、這顯然是受了山居環境的限制、此外另有在城市中、世襲開執事行的、在一般人的眼中、便把他們和「惰民」「九姓漁戶」（係元時駐兵遺裔、元亡、此輩求為奴隸以免死、多操挑槓、屠薙、喜娘、諸役、）同等看待、稱為「賤民」或「小姓人」、而今民族平等、當然應以正當勞工業目之、可無疑義、</p>
<p>大部份的山居畬民、類多性情和善、勤苦耐勞、到城市來做買賣、和土著人亦頗相得、而本族互助團結的精神、且為漢人所不及、可惜文化智識低落、迷信程度很深、染了疾病、說是被神降災、有所欣遇、也歸功於神之所賜、於是不惜用很多金錢、去請巫覡禳解和謝恩、年節祭祖、單用三牲體、不用熟食、幷秘密舉行不給外人看　、致引起無謂的猜疑、說他們供奉着的始祖、是個大頭的槃弧之像、這與內地的清真寺和教堂、有些人想參觀而不得參觀、就悞傳裏面是崇奉如彼如此的怪像、都是同樣的無意識、而難於憑信的事、</p>
<p>不過畬民不曾受過相當的基本教育、這是事實、前清時、腦筋敏活的、入過私塾、要求參與科舉考試、可惜又碰了　　朝廷的釘子、民國以來、雖號教育機會平等、畢竟格於牢不易破的習俗、這裏縱沒有歧視的心裏、但他們還有些「羞與為伍」的關念、甯願躲在私塾、讀些「三百千千」的一類舊書、不願而亦無力跨進正式學校來讀有用的科學書、倘當局認為調整整個中華民族的步伐、對畬民獎勸從學的問題、是目前刻不容緩的要圖、當然再不可「忽然置之」、何况彼族男女平等團結精神的優點、還好對當地重男輕女的惡俗、打上一劑救廢補偏的興奮針、</p>

<h3>華商紗廠聯合會　定期會商救濟紗業　日商在華擴展實力華商危殆　推代表向中央請願要求援助</h3>
<p>我國紗業現受走私及紗廠大量之傾銷影響、處境日蹙、已成無法維持之勢、日商乘機遂大量投資、進行收買、决以天津為中心、積極增加錠數、並擴充植棉區、以達掌握全華業、故我國紗業前途、已成覆巢之卵、全國紗業聯合會定期將召開聯席會議、討論挽救辦法、茲探各情如後、</p>
<p>日商投資　收買華廠</p>
<p>天津裕元紗廠、已於本年五月間賣於日商鐘紡會社後、刻正改裝機件、定名為裕豐第二分廠、(第一分廠在滬)原有紗錠七萬將擴充至十萬、另購附近小劉莊地畝、擬於明年春間動工建築第三分廠、亦可容紗錠七萬及布機一千台、計劃在三年後、使小劉莊成為日人僑華之工業區、並有東洋紡織業會社、亦在特四區計劃創一新紗廠、先設紗錠五萬、再續加擴充、在兩年內、須增至十萬錠、其次如裕大紗廠、自由日本紡織會社經營後、原有紗錠兩萬、現已擴充至四萬、尚有寶成紗廠、亦因無力經營、於本月十七日、由債權團以十七萬五千元拍賣與裕大紗廠接管、刻正在進行改裝增加紗錠、尚有裕大紗廠、自於七月初由日商收買後、改為公大第六分廠、除原有紗錠七萬、刻擬擴充至十五萬錠、除紡細紗外、並擬自行織布、照最近情勢、天津全部份華商紗廠、均將被日商一一收買、三年以後、可掌握全中國紗業云</p>
<p>尚有三廠　續行收買</p>
<p>除裕元·寶成·裕大等三紗廠、已由日人收買外、尚有華新紗廠、刻亦由日商興中公司、大倉公司東洋紡織社鐘社等進行收買中、其次如誠孚信託公司經營之北洋恒源兩紗廠、亦因無法與日商競爭、連日開會討論、結果决定出售於日人經營、不久亦將成交、日本紗業界、但據本埠紗廠聯合會特電津詢問、則電復「報載失實絕無此事」云云、現除積極收買天津全部份華商經營之紗廠外、並對唐山·石莊·青島·等地之華商紗廠、亦在注意中、擬將進行收買、故華北各華商紗廠、遭此嚴電威脅、已成覆巢之卵、前途殊堪憂慮也、</p>
<p>各地設肆　廉價傾銷</p>
<p>前述各廠已成為日商經營之基礎外、並進一步計劃壟斷全中國紗業起見、故一方側重於我國所不能紡織之細紗為主、一方對於運輸辦法、向我國當局要求優異待遇、對於應納之營業稅及其他捐稅、亦不定納、並為掌握全華紗銷起見、已在長江一帶、及蕪湖各埠、設肆售紗、廉價傾銷外、一俟天津所收買之各廠整理完畢、開工出品後、再將在華南華中及重要市鎮、由日商前往設肆售紗、因其不納各種捐稅、故華紗勢難競爭、其雄心之大、可見一斑也</p>
<p>實部派員　赴德考察</p>
<p>實業部方面、對日商在華設廠傾銷日紗、認為若無整個計劃、勢難挽救、茲為明瞭國外紡織業情形、俾資借鏡起見、已派余建勛氏赴德國考察、余氏業於本月十五日來滬、辦理出國手續、定明日)二十二日)搭乘總國郵輪波慈德姆號直赴德國、專行考察紡織及人造絲、期定六個月、</p>
<p>廠商聯會　籌謀挽救</p>
<p>全國華商紗廠聯合會、業於華紗銷路已成危機、而天津各華商亦被日商投資收買、全國紗業已成覆巢之卵、若無具體整個計劃、勢難挽此危運、故現由該會理事會集商、擬具提案後、將召開會員大會、通告各地華商紗廠、派員來滬出席、共商辦法、再推代表晋京、分向各院部請願、要求有力之援助、以維實業、</p>
<p>徐桴整頓　滬市財政計劃</p>
<p>約分七大項目</p>
<p>本市原為全國商業之中心地、中外觀瞻所繋、然自事變後、收入銳減、而支出反形增長、因此年來財政、異常拮据、記者昨晤最近從日本考察市政返國財政局設計委員胡一臧君、談及徐局長整頓滬市財政計畫如下、本局徐局長自蒞任以來、廢寢忘食、從事整頓、未及三月、已將前任債務、完全理清、目下徐局長為確立財政方針、建設模範的市財政起見、規劃進行者、約分七端、卽　整頓房捐、　清理田賦舊欠、　增益公產收入、　確立會計制度、　勵行預算、　肅清各種捐稅積弊、　振作辦事精神等、其間田賦一項、積欠達五六十萬元、現正設計清理、徵收房捐、亦有改良辦法、公產方面、劃分縣市區域後、研究其性質、分別利用、他如會計制度辦事規則、以及其他整個計畫、經秘書吳修·吳乾虁·科長陳峻·石磊·夏懋　諸先生之努力研究、均渙然刷新、凡從前流弊逐一革除、一方為整理土地計、亦派專家設計、總期上海市財政地政、可為全國之模範云云、</p>

<h3>多頭大批出籠　標紗又見狂瀉　遠期暴跌二元餘</h3>

<p>（標紗步步下挫）標紗前市開盤、本月八月均呈狂漲之象、因七、八月陳花多方擠軋、形勢嚴重、近期紗被其牽動七、八月狂跳一元五、七角、拍至遠期、反見下跌三、四角、至七、八角、一元一角、二盤仍屬無勁、因澄記、通記、多頭大批出籠、檯面鬆懈、市盤步步下挫、結果本月比上日收盤價漲三角、遠跌一元二角至醫院八角、午後開盤、被上午多方出檔後、氣象轉平、買者缺乏、同時棉市平庸、紗市愈弱、盤盤不振、長豐、潤　最買千賣、標紗結果各月比上午收盤價均跌六七角至一元、查賣出澄記七千二百包、通記二千一百五十包、豐泰二千五百五十包、裕大七百包、慎記六百包、大昌成三千四百五十包、同和八百包、振大八百五十包、合興一千一百五十包、長暨二千七百五十包、潤康一千三百包、買進大豐一千包、錦昌二千二百五十包、森康二千九百五十包、長豐三千四百包、潤康一千零五十包、慎記二千六百包、義成一千八百包、泰興一千三百包、仁豐九百包、裕康九百五十包、信誠八百五十包、一日間高低價及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布祗有津帮不動</h3>
<p>昨棉布市情、因紗花回疲、業內人心略軟、而疋頭廠商因花貴關係、心思仍屬堅挺、實銷又轉佳好、各貨無不奇缺、呈明鬆暗緊之象、售盤多數均與上週彷彿、行銷以本廠印花絨、彩條絨、白　絨、細布、細斜、各廠嗶嘰、直貢縐呢、印花直貢、嗶嘰、花標、等貨為最繁、東貨細布、因售盤業已大漲、各染廠本月份定價足敷應用、進意轉淡、惟現貨仍大感缺乏、下檔本廠細布客路需要最為殷切、漢口帮辦進現貨一百數十件、湘贛等帮、本廠細布細斜嗶嘰縐紋呢等貨、需要仍然不惡、皖帮亦辦進白貨細布及色貨鴻章廠嗶嘰直貢等一百餘件、川帮走銷、本廠花絨、彩條絨、縐紋呢、嗶嘰、直貢等貨仍未銷衰、廣帮因時局專機、人心安定、粵帮騰漲、粵市貨底頗形缺乏、故辦貨心思異常活躍、昨日成交本廠細斜五百餘包、細布五六十件、及綸昌花布直貢嗶嘰等五十餘箱、烟台青島帮進意亦活潑、昨進鴻章慶豐美恒等廠各牌綫呢二百餘件、惟津帮最為岑寂云、</p>
<h3>糧食　期麥進出頓見岑寂</h3>
<p>昨日期賣市面、各月一致平寂、因洋麥報價、芝加哥又大跌一元左右、坎拿大小八角左右、利物浦小半辦士、故開價後、交易見清、價呈疲滯、惟業外人心尙佳、故難大落、迨至下午開盤、交易依然不振、價亦盤旋、因此種高昂之市價、祗有外行買進、業中人反多套售、且洋麥如果續鬆、遠期合價愈近、此則不可不注意也、現麥市面、因扳戶扳售甚力、各廠吃大二分、開蚌埠管店明光麥四元五角半、淮安竹鎮麥四元四角六分、大橋麥四元三角六分、漢口麥四元四角、江北麥四元三角八分、高郵麥四元四角五六分、江新州麥四元三角、蕪湖麥四元三角二分、由福新去一萬包、申大又一千包、阜豐去一千包云、</p>

<h3>期粉轉帳交易不少</h3>
<p>麵粉市面、上下午開盤、各月份仍照新限價賣買、惟聞進過正式手續者、為數不多、大部分均屬雙方轉賬、惟非正式之暗盤、因洋麥報價、人心轉虛、如八月份祗加一分後則加半分多、頭亦願脫手、至於廠家現貨、前週尙須加五分、今則聞已不加、交易所之成單、可以抽買云、</p>
<h3>新黃荳旺到續跌</h3>
<p>昨日新黃豆去路、雖有汕頭帮及本街繼續採辦、但其來源日湧、故市難以轉定、大勢步疲、昨市最高貨祗開五元六角、中關最低價開五元四角、次貨竟無人問訊、昨統市做開九江城門豆一千二百餘包、其他未開、陳豆因豆餅銷路尙好、故廠家辦豆見接、昨成交開原豆十三車、蚌補豆四車、駐馬店豆二千包、行情比前市略疲三四分云、</p>
<h3>中次白粳走化尙佳</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮東源仍稀、祗到十二三號、貨共二千四五百石、本街銷塲較昨略活、包胃青島龍口帮辦六百餘包、故厚薄稻行情高貨又見帶緊幾分、中宿貨平平、杜洋尖及陰變元無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源約念號、市上各貨銷塲、白粳高料平淡、中次者續有去化、市價高定、中下者價稍緊、白元續有零拆、價又緊五六分、薄稻無榮辱、陰元貨稀、價形提升、羊尖去路仍呆、價高檔平疲、中次又見疲勢、埠客尖零銷平淡、價又見軟勢、其餘各貨、尙形平和、</p>
<h3>客秈湧到銷路亦暢</h3>
<p>昨客秈客化甚旺、尤以內地甯波為食、北洋帮亦起辦裝、本街亦有應酬、市面頗有向榮之象、但以連日到頭甚旺、貨主亦擬趁機求脫、查在最近三天中、新到共有二萬五千包以上、卽前日一天中亦有一萬多包、來源尤以長江為旺、江西最多、此次湘漢、到頭一旺、市價遂難上展、故昨開各價均與前相似、惟人心與市氣均較見活潑、北洋帮辦去湘靖一千多包、內地與甬帮則去安慶機米漢口糙與江西中次各米、本街祗辦江西高身貨、統計全市開出有七千多包云、</p>
<h3>金融　為佣金未解決　標金昨無形停業</h3>
<p>經紀人要求當日了結交易……作為未納…減半收費…所方未允</p>
<p>金交理事會為維持營業起見、通告於十六日起增收經手費為每條國幣一角、除經紀人獎勵金二分半外、凈收七分半、經紀方面、於十五日開公會討論、認為原則接受、惟要求改為進出兩方面共一角、除獎勵金二分半、換言之卽單面三分七厘半、並要求展緩至二十日實行、當蒙理事會對於延期部份接受、惟對於減收經手費為雙面凈徵七分半、則未能允准、經紀人於十七日召集二次會議、議決關於過夜條子、准照所方所修改之經手費辦理、惟關於當日了結之賣買、定為未納交易、其佣金減半收取、由會長向所方交涉、孰料未有結果、經紀人公會會長事後亦未明白公告、結果如何、以致各經紀人懷疑難決、昨日為增加佣金之實行期、各經紀人遂不敢貿然下塲賣買、半天間無形停市、</p>
<h3>買戶較稀　滙市略轉鬆動</h3>

<h3>證券　公債交易掉期居多　市呈近高遠低之象</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況大都堅穩、交易以掉期為多、賣戶雖湧、市價竟不受壓迫、仍屬空頭掉期為多、兩廣大體解後、已與公債市場、不關休戚、七月份期貨無多日、籌碼當尙有一番傾軋、大都交貨者以四十七號為多、收貨者則屬於川帮居多、本月份期貨、尙餘四千萬左右、浮多則已獲利、當圖出路、浮空則不易再有意外機會、除斬割及掉期外無他途、公債市況於交割後、亦可趨於平穩、昨日經過、賣戶如十一、以及二十一、四十八號等、堪稱踴躍、三十五號之空頭掉期、亦甚熱鬧、而四號及二十號買進、則非常熱鬧、散戶亦進多出少、市價仍漲五分一角至二角半、趨勢仍極堅穩、次盤十四號賣出比十一號為尤湧、四號繼續抬價、而空方掉期則最為熱鬧、一律呈近高遠低之象、市價結果、大都續漲五分一角至二角、惟甲種近期漲五角半為最多、丁丙兩種遠期、尙微小五分、成交總數、共計九十七萬元、茲將其漲結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>糖市　汕滙暴跌潮糖高漲</h3>
<p>昨潮糖據航空函訊、青赤白糖產價一致上騰、如上提青為十五元三角、高黃崗青十四元五六角、隆港青十二元五角、比前均升一元左右、餘如冰花白二十二元、奇白二十元、高枝洋十九元、高綿赤十八元二角、次不一、又據汕頭電訊、匯水變動甚鉅、上午為一千二百四十元、下午一千二百元、比週六降去七八十元、故此間號盤頓見活躍、明合提青三十餘包、開十二元、比升元許、士合高綿赤九十八包、十五元、比升半元、廣帮開出惠州赤（又名原圍赤）二百餘包、十三元、比升三四角、建帮開出漳刁青四百餘包、九元八角、</p>
<p>合組公司昨為本週第一次標兌粵糖之期、計總定額為六千七百三十七包、標價如前、當售出順德廠五羊粗白十包、二十一元八角、曲溪廠又一百包、二十一元三角、市中砂白五百六十包、十九元三角、四號綿白三十包、二十元六角、其餘原價未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新海南圓肉已登場　新金菜地價升一二元　新漳枝到多市難望好</h3>
<p>新金菜　近以粵閩兩帮銷路活躍、而尤以徐州菜最合各帮需要、故申帮向地頭採購者為數特多、因此產假突見激升、昨電步漲一二元之譜、行盤有隨升之望、</p>
<p>新圓肉　首批新海南圓肉、聞產區業已登場、昨據號方電訊、已有小數由香港轉裝、大約日內卽可抵申云、</p>
<p>新漳枝　第三批新漳枝、昨由濟南輪運到七百餘箱、其中除轉口外、申市佔大部份、其餘金山枝等亦連日有到、號盤開價步鬆、聞未開之額、連海口枝在內共達萬餘箱、時實無回好之望</p>
<h3>絲茶　橫濱絲市晨漲午回</h3>
<p>邇來海外絲價頻漲、最近則漸復下降、蓋先因今庚日本春　欠佳、幾及百分之三十、故六月以還、絲價步漲、自六百十四元逐漸盤上、直達七百五十元大　、但後據確訊、本年度日本農林省發表、日本全國　收預測為三千九百四十九萬八千九百九十貫、較去年實收、津減少百分之一、六、於是市氣漸鬆、紐約絲價亦告回軟矣、昨日橫濱現貨售開七百四十七元半、期貨七三九元、較上週六升二元至五元許、然交易俱未見旺、至午後遂告回小、紐約昨日無市、申埠市況清堅、缺乏交易、絲價較上週初、亦回小一二十元云、</p>
<h3>日意人造絲走銷頗强</h3>
<p>日貨人造絲缺乏、價格猛漲、昨一百二十號天橋牌四百二十一二元、太陽美女牌四百十元、成交十餘箱、意貨街存難厚、惟因價較日貨為廉、走銷殊暢、成交亦鉅、計一百二十號二號司尼挨有光棧單六十餘箱、價一百十二元、三號三十餘箱、價一百零五元、購者為杭帮蘇帮及本埠綢廠、本埠某字號向意商司尼挨洋行開進一百號四號求利有光、棧單貨二百八十五箱、價九十九元、又某字號、向日商阿部士洋行定購一百五十號天橋牌無光二十箱、價一百五十八元、外稅、本月份交貨、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉歐銷轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶市況、交易尙不寂寞、婺源屯溪等路高莊珍眉綠茶、銷路復活、抽芯提尖貨頂盤開出一百四十元、惟普通莊貨因市上存底豐厚、售盤仍難回高、針眉綠茶、亦有零星交易、蝦目珠茶一項、銷路頗俏、售價亦繼續上漲、至祁寗紅茶、昨市略見走銷、怡和協和錦隆等行、均有進胃、惟售價較上週又跌一二元至三四元不等云、</p>
<p>又據茶葉公會報告云、各路珍眉、因存底不厚、到茶亦綏、尤以佳者極少、以致昨日市面無甚發展、惟高莊抽珍昨有售出價一百三十六元、同孚保昌均略有成交、價以略堅、但中莊抽珍售出僅一百十一二元、價較前為疲、土莊抽珍錦隆約有二百件進辦、價六十五元至七十五元、高莊貢熙白頭行家仍頗有辦胃、尤以九十元之特別貢熙進意為濃、平水珍眉、錦隆擇普通者約辦入五百餘箱、價二十九三十元云、</p>
<h3>五金　扎鐵存底甚感稀薄</h3>
<p>昨日五金交易較前熱鬧、出口亦繁、英鋼板七厘半一分開出四五百扎、價比前高一角、竹節鋼條一百噸、由南京建築帮辦去、價一百二十四元五角、馬口鐵會司鐵仍由廠家及客帮辦去四五百箱、查底存甚少、市頗堅挺、扎鐵廠家及用戶均搜辦不已、但底存奇缺、行情高起二角半、每扎（二百磅）沽二十六元、此外各金屬品、難均有開出、但市無甚榮辱、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （寒梅）</p>
<p>世間很多的女子對於伊丈夫的行動是監視得十分細心的；但是，伊們對於國家民族的生死存亡，却都不問不聞。</p>
<p>世間很多的年靑女子都高喊着「男女平權」的口號；但是，伊們當着愛人的面則又是：「你們男子應該要讓我們女子一點呀！」</p>
<p>世間很多衛道的君子，他們認為男女合校是有傷風化的，短褲裸臂是有碍觀瞻的；但是，當他們看見了妓女的手絹，却一樣做詩，遇到了姨太太的墳墓，却一樣的塡詞，眞猜不透他們究竟是什麽心腸。</p>
<p>「貞烈」二字，在「舊禮敎」的社會裏，幾乎是專有的金字招牌。女人們為了它，不知道犧牲了多少寳貴的生命。</p>
<h3>天空間的軍火商</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>槍砲現在是在需要之中，但是還不及飛機這般的急切需要。槍砲是比較容易得到的，但是飛機郤就困難了。因此現代私運軍火的商人已經把目光移轉到飛機上去。有些小國肯出重價收買各式各樣的飛機。在英國不論何種軍火未得外交部的許可，都不能出口的，准許出口的都發給一張執照，但是裝運商用的飛機出口並不禁止的。利用這一點，飛機便可冒充商用而運到各中立國去。在數小時內，這些外表和平的載客飛機一變而為兇猛殘酷的戰爭利器了。於是再運到收買飛機的國家去。這樣，禁止出口的命令是遵守的而私運軍火者依舊可以自由活動。</p>
<p>私運飛機是在南美洲的玻璃維亞與巴拉圭戰爭時期中開始的。首先想到做這種業務的是一個富有冒險精神的靑年工程師。他化了許多姓名，把市塲上所有出售的舊飛機和各種機器配件完全收買下來。為了避免對於他業務上種種的不利起見，他在深夜裏把舊飛機和各種機器配件裝上運貨汽軍，運到一座廢棄的敎堂的地窖裏去私藏着，預備過幾天一有機會便裝船運到海外去。</p>
<p>有一夜他的秘密幾乎被人發覺，幸虧他有念智，否則是很危險的。原來他正在忙亂地把飛機機件從運貨汽車上卸下的時候，有一個鄉鎭的警察坐着脚踏車迎面而來。忽然這個警察停車下來了，拿出電筒一照，喊道，「喂，做甚麽啊？」這位工程師不慌不忙，不加思索，回答道：「不做什麽。這些都是價値低廉的鋼琴機件。我要把它們裝置起來，製造完善的鋼琴，我發見把它們藏在敎堂的地窖裏，要便宜得多，因為租費是十分低廉的啊。」</p>
<h3>海桃雋談</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>雪藕氷桃，又是應時鮮品了，上海的桃，是素來有名的，據我所知，有黃泥牆桃，露香園桃，和龍華桃。</p>
<p>那黃泥牆的故址，卽今蓬萊市塲，當時的園主人，姓衛，字介堂，是一位隱於園藝的風雅士，他鰥居不娶，並沒有子嗣，除了種桃，又豢養了一頭獅子狗，有林和靖梅妻鶴子之風，這頭狗很是兇悍，據說夜間多偷桃的東方朔，不得不藉此防備的，那園本名「益壽」，是取神異經：「東方有樹，名曰桃。其子和核作羹，食之令人益壽」的意思，榜額出於孝廉公馮梓臣手筆，仿董香光體，很是瀟灑，因為他的圍墻是黃泥的，俗人稱為黃泥牆，益壽的名反而掩沒不彰了，每到夏日，朱實離離，和綠葉映襯着，別有一種景色，凡納二百錢，便可為入幕之賓，在桃蔭下品茗憇坐，任意指定樹頭的巨桃，由園丁採擷下來，以供大嚼，多少不拘，飽啖為度，但不能携帶出外，後來外間劣桃充着黃泥牆的很多，甚至有以蛀壞的桃，用燈草塞沒蛀孔，更用桃毛掩飾的，不久衛介堂死了　　黃泥牆便也鞠為茂草了。</p>
<p>現今九畝地，尙有露香園街的名目，原來那露香園是「和豫園日涉園稱為海上三大園的，可惜這三大園都成陳跡了，露香園的水蜜桃，表皮有硃紅的圈，說是每經一次雷震，桃上便添了許多的圈兒，所以稱為「雷震紅」，為地方官供獻上峯之用，且產額不多民間是不易得嘗的</p>
<p>龍華蟠桃，至今仍存留着，和玉露桃滋春桃爭一日之短長，距龍華寺大約三里多路，有地名呌俞家灣的，是桃花最盛之處，市上喚賈的龍華蟠桃，便是俞家灣的產物，聞日本東京也有龍華蟠桃出售，不但甘美，並且無核，是用龍華蟠桃的種子，加以科學法栽植的。</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （張皇）</p>
<p>——賣票人面上英法分界——</p>
<p>我和妻帶了二個孩子乘電車往西門去。這輛電車是通過英法兩租界地面的。我照例先買到分界交點東新橋站的車票，授給賣票人兩張票錢。出其不意的客氣，他推掉票錢不受，向我擠了兩擠他的一只眼。在他這鬼祟的行動上，我悟到他要揩油，（上海的大衆語，就是取得非分的錢財），還要我替他暫為保留。這是恐怕查票人上車來。他可假借忙碌未及賣票的話頭對付着。是預築一道防禦綫的用意。我暗忖：我何樂而為他私人盡這意外的義務，更祖負一個通同作弊的罪名。可是我終於遵他的暗示，把那密集微生物的銅幣保守在掌中，直到抵站纔被收去。他並沒有感謝的表示，我也像交卸了一樁公事般的毫無異議。這巳成為公衆所在的慣例。</p>
<p>接着，電車駛入法租界地面，我再掏出兩張車票的數目交與賣票人。賣票人還是此人，不過他的臉色立刻莊嚴起來說敎一般的：「票子須買四張，沒有還價！」我會意　是孩子應盡的義務，就在他催迫一聲「爽氣點！」的口音之間補費與他。他在賣票完事後與其他乘客表明心跡似的閒談道：「法蘭西的章程兇來兮！四歲的孩子就得買票。一不留神，便吃重罰呢！」</p>
<p>於是，我在這個賣票人的臉上，發現了幅電車路綫圖，那上面有英法二租界的界綫，分劃的很清楚，很淸楚！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>這竹梢儘管是不會同平常兩樣的，不過這時看起來，好像是很有意義，所以慢慢的放着步子，把這些竹梢看完，走出巷子口去了。國器站定了脚，又回頭看，然而這條這巷子裏，比以前是更顯着寂寞，速小販賣東西的吆喚聲，也一點都聽不到了。他也不再猶豫，逕直的走回家去。到家以後，只呌了一聲母親，便到書房裏，兩手臂環抱着放在桌沿上，自己却是呆了眼光，看了文具邊，那一尊維納絲的偶像出神。所幸家裏女僕劉媽，巳經是復職了，房裏進進出出是他小主人的態度如何與他無關，他也不怎樣的放在心上。吃午飯的時候劉媽呌了他好幾次，他才扶了桌子慢慢的站了起來，然後皺了眉毛，向堂屋裏走。可是一走出房門來，立刻滿臉推下了笑容，向母親道：今天的午飯，早得多了。章老太道：不呀。我以為比平常要晚二三十分鐘，你會撥急呢。你怎還說是早？國器笑道：我可並不是嫌飯晚了。我在書房裏，隨便翻了兩頁書，就不想到了吃午飯的時間了。章老太道，不要多說了，快吃飯罷，恐怕這已經是誤了你的時間。國器聽了這話，臉上就是一紅；心想誤了時間的事，母親也會知道嗎？然而偷看老人家的顏色，是很大方，很慈祥的。他臉上和平常的情形一樣，並不帶什麽疑惑的樣子，這才放了心，坐下來，從容吃飯。飯後，章老太指着墻上的掛鐘道：已經是一點鐘了，你還不該上學堂去嗎？國器聽到這樣一催，心裏又是一動，然而看看母親的態度，還是靠了桌沿坐下，將臉微仰着，帶慈祥的笑容看人。好像他心裏很盼切，又很安慰似的。（五〇）</p>
<h3>香臭之扇骨</h3>
<p>— 淸瘦</p>
<p>扇骨有香氣，如檀香所製者，今恒見之，不足為異，而有專取惡臭，以為可郤暑辟瘟之用者，則人知之者尠，試述其名一曰「阿魏，」一曰「麝香，」此兩物皆藥用品，而一香一臭，以之入扇骨之上端，時以鼻嗅之，如酷暑旅行，極合衛生。</p>
<p>「阿魏，」為一種植物，係多年生草，其葉似胡蘿菔，花細色黃，　聚如繖狀，根中富有白汁，截之，流出如注，濃厚且較乳漿而過之，迨乾後，漸結成固體，其性能發生惡臭，然此種氣質，可祛邪穢，而避疫癘；故於藥肆中購一二錢，置於扇之大骨上端，黏成半圓形，一如墳起然，恐其剝落，用刀微刮骨面，俾有磨擦力，則可永久弗脫，在夏秋之間，旣可拂暑，又可掩鼻，一物兩用，其良好之品也。</p>
<p>「麝香，」產自四川雲南，雌者無香，唯雄臍之下部，有一腺囊，其液時時分泌，而其芳澤可聞諸四野，故獵者往往以嗅覺所及，得其踪跡之所在，其形如小麋，文若虎豹，其　有香，為人所逐，卽自投高岩，伸爪剔出其香，臨死，猶拱四足以護其臍，其物之珍貴可想，今國醫藥上，亦為重要之用品；特贗者則其芳不烈，故購時須有鑒別之識力，如眞者只須一二分，輸入扇之大骨中，則舉手輕搖，共香刺入鼻孔，有時竟可充滿一室，洵異品也；最好扇骨刻花者，且可於極細微之空隙中灌進，允能歷久不散，唯麝香粉末，切忌乾燥，及樟腦硫磺等接觸，否則，卽失其固有之性，不可不慎也。</p>
<p>唯此一香一臭之扇骨，近時已不多見，昨在塔蔭，見姚書雲醫家，備用此兩柄，而幷得聞其薰蕕之來歷，因特述之如此。</p>

<h3>日本觀察日蝕的趣聞</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本民間關於日蝕，也有一種迷信。乃是在日蝕以後，結婚的不論男女一方面，總不能滿足，難於偕老。所以這次日蝕，在北日本農間，便有提早結婚的事實。而女子方面，事前不知道日蝕，一些也沒有預備，大有左右為難的苦痛。</p>
<p>英國斯脫郞敦博十是有名的天文學家，於一九一四年，便開始第一次覜察日蝕，現在已是第六次的觀察了。他費了六星期的航海時間，五十多天的準備，方才將觀測機械配置就緒，滿想在日本得着很好的成績回去。這次他是在上斜里觀測，十八日陰雨，把他急得要命。看見村人在上斜　神社祈願快晴，他也好奇的去進了香。那知道神社無靈，在十九日日蝕的時候，滿天烏雲，連太陽也看不清楚。只好垂頭喪氣，分解了機械預備回國，斯脫郎敦一隊，是住在上斜里的小學校裏，臥室是由女子裁縫室改造的。和他同來的學生，還沒有學着日本習慣，不要說穿了皮鞋走到草蓆上去，連舖在蓆上的被褥上也有了脚印。</p>
<p>住在中頓別的捷克觀察隊的去約爾博士，好像是到過日本的。其餘三個人還是第一次，之後，便是滿池的肥皂水，以後使沒有人能入浴，非完全丟掉不可。他們又聽不懂日本話，管理浴室的老婆子，眞是把他們沒有辦法了。我國的余靑松技師和鄒女士是住在中頓別的附近枝幸地方，得着意外美滿的成績，夫的爾博士和余技師十分投機，已同行到我國，參觀南京的天文台。</p>
<p>日本理研仁科博士，獨自住在斜里嶽的小屋裏觀察着，那裏離開札幌要有一天路程。因為要便利消息，便用了兩個人，運送郵件和電報。每一個人只拿着幾封很輕的書信往來步行着，而可得兩元半的酬勞。因為那裏不但山路崎嶇，並且中途很有遇着熊的危險。但是日本郵政的無微不至，是很可佩服的。</p>
<p>十九日天氣預報，東風曇，有地方小雨。後來南風，一時晴，夜間南風轉東風，時時曇。但是淸早起身，便是大雨。下午雨止，烏雲中略有日光，於是中央氣象台的電話，便大忙起來，但是那裏看得淸楚。上野科學館上站滿着失望的女學生。各學校的小型望遠鏡，完全失去了效用，只好在敎室裏聽着敎師的「日蝕演講會」，聊以解嘲。</p>

<h3>一個和尙一份齋</h3>
<p>— 黃貽淸</p>
<p>倒是分食的好榜樣！</p>
<p>和尙吃齋飯，一個人一份，食　預先闖在桌上，食時靜寂無聲，連喝粥都不許發簌簌的聲音。　碗，可略避　，蠅的沾染。他們的菜，是幾種菜蔬合煮在一塊兒的素齋，吃不到什麽動物性蛋白質，在民族的繁榮上說來，固然滋養殊嫌不够，不過為便於他們淸心寡慾着想，不喫動物性食物，倒也很對的。喝粥不許發聲音，固然未免矯枉過正，但喫飯時候老是且喫，且大談特談其「天」，喉間懸壅垂（小舌頭）疲於奔命，忙個不了，難免忙裏有錯，弄得東西喫到氣管裏去發嗆，本來也不對。而和　喫齋，尤其足供艷羨的，便是一人一份的分食辦法。</p>
<p>平常一個害霍亂，痢疾，或腸熱的人，大象還容易知道不宜和他共食。一個害白喉的人，大家也還容易知道不宜和他共食。可是遇到不很重的肺癆病人，面部還沒有露醜相的梅毒病人，或是明知他書喉痛，牙痛的人，以為不打緊，便滿不在乎地和他共食，一些兒不介意。至於木顯任何病象的人，在一般人看來，那更以為都是好人，不是病人，無須和他分食的。那裏知道健康人口腔裏，實在也常常有兩種相依為命——營共生作用——的微生物，一種呌做梭狀桿菌，一種呌做奮森氏螺旋體，在裏面活着。嘴裏有臭味時，這兩種微生物繁殖得特多。有時牙齦腫痛，滿口發急性炎（牙齒不良和不講口腔衛生的人，特易發生這種情形，）或是致咽部發咽峽炎，就是這兩種小東西在裏面作祟。咽頭左右，咽頭上壁，和舌根部各扁桃體上，並且常常含有一種鏈球菌。中年人或少年人扁桃體慢慢兒肥大發炎，致咽頭腫脹，嚥吐都很艱困（俗稱喉痺），或是突然發炎，致腫痛發熱（俗稱喉蛾），也就是這平時躱在裏面的細菌在那兒作祟。尋常不害白喉，並沒接觸過白喉病人的人，嘴裏也常有白喉菌（固然，一部份含的是無毒性菌，可不致傳白喉病，）言和白喉病人接近的人，允常含菌，而他們自己仍可不病，健康如常。別種痰唾傳集病，像腦脊髓熱等等，郵子也很多。結核病和梅毒兩種慢性惡毒傳染病，有時病人撑上了，自己尙且不知道，或者自己和旁人都以為他早已治好，實際他所用器皿，未必沒有傳染可能。至於顯然害了白喉，結核等等痰唾傳染病，或微生物徧竄全身的梅毒，嘴裏各自有特殊的毒性菌體，給你知這要和他分食的，眞只佔得傳病危險情况的萬分之一二罷了。人家嘴裏吐出來的東西。除非嬰兒不懂什麽，情痴不管什麽，大概都認為是髒的。那末要知共菜合食，自然囉，舉箸取菜，出入口腔之際，筷頭上和旁人交換些唾液和各自養家的細菌，是免不了的。</p>
<p>俗話說的「一個和尙一份齋」，是個譬喻，着重在一個「和尙」，要給他一份「齋」。不過事實上和尙喫齋，也却一個人擱一份，所以作者便擱起了分量的應當注重，附會到衛生的分食法上了。可是卑之無高論，要實行衛生觀點上的一人一份制，在一個學校或社團裏，仿行起來？固然很容易，在一個家庭裏，想驟然大改革，老實說：總未免有些扞格難行。家庭間如能採取共菜分食制，多備幾把筷兒和調羹，作公用食器，另備各自送到嘴裏的筷，調羹和杯碗，由父母兄弟，諸姑姊妹各自認定，專供一人使用，已是上乘。實際如果一家人確知個個健康，絕無病痛，口腔衛生又都很講究，那末平時合食，原來也無妨。萬一有人發現喉痛，牙痛，以及種種口鼻排洩物傳染病（括傷風），口粘膜觸染病，儘可臨時參用和尙喫齋的制度，敎這個有病痛的家人暫時分食，做個「酒肉和尙，」學着參禪。但這是最低限度的辦法，必要時，當然務能實行才是。凖此，都會人士請客宴會，也不一定要「掛起洋商招牌」，喫什麽西餐，儘可探取「爾愛其羊，我愛其禮」的精神，取「珠」還「犢」，中菜西喫，也落得簡省而又乾凈。不過現在各地備中菜西喫排塲的餐　還不多，間或有之，售價往往比西餐還貴，實在令人愛好不來。</p>
<p>思想過敏的朋友，也許蒿目社會窮困，認為（分食必先足食，上海灘上向送飯人搶賸餘食物喫的「癟三」，未見得一個個因不衛生而死盡；內地大多數人够喫就好了，那裏講得到隔開湌盤，無關緊要的分食）。假使有人這麼想，那末，朋友！須知衛生雖和社會問題關切極密，可也自然有個分野。衛生在這兒，是銜接着「有了够喫的分料，才能講得到分食」，進一步勸人「有了够喫的分料，還要實行其分食」的。</p>

<h3>福而島之少女療養院</h3>
<p>該院成立於一九二九年，建築費一百七十萬馬克，佔地的百畝，位置在島之西北部，院旁有沙灘，可供海沿，該院由國家保險機關管理之，專門收容一般女子職員之患病者前往休養之用，不另取費。</p>
<p>全院略作日形，共有一百三十個床位，經常費每月三萬餘馬克，平均每人每日須費十馬克半，以手術室之應用甚少，且無醫藥與院產利息之支出，故特省，每室二人者居多數，各室均東南向，俱有隔離之洋台，及壁橱冷熱水設備，底層為盥洗室，供療養者在海浴後或體操後洗面之用，X光療室一大間，按摩室十餘間，又塵內游泳池，用機器汲進海水，而保持常溫者，三面均窗，四壁為磁磚，作淡綠色，其位置之大小，與全屋之色彩，與我國虹橋療養院之交誼廳，甚為相仿，其後為屋內運動塲，室之一端，設有舞臺，可供開會演講開演電影音樂及戲劇之用，第一層之正中為前廳，左為閱書室，右為遊戲室，如棋子等類俱備，室作淡黃色，置有花草數事，淸雅絕俗，過前廳為樓梯上下之大道，其廳事長可十公尺，寬亦如之，四壁作淡紅色，雜以朱椽明鏡，煥麗莊嚴，兼而有之，盡右之甬道，為大飯廳，綺窗四闢，牆均以本色木質為之，其燈光亦採用直綫發光器，而各室之掛燈亦均純採圓形，與虹橋療養院所採用者完全相同，且出自同一廠家，其手術室亦位置向北，四壁為無光之淡灰色磁磚，其燈光亦用無陰影之採光器，其廠家又與虹院所用者相同，世界之大，不意乃巧合如斯也。</p>
<p>綜觀該院之特點除地理上具有海洋空氣之治療性質以外，他如所有臥室悉數南向，每室均有附屬之洋臺，辦事室均向北面，與虹院相同者一，該院注意於色彩之調和，每層均各不同，卽以門論，如作紅色，其門框四周作黑色，或加以套色，如淡灰深灰淡綠深綠者是，虹院之設色，亦每層不同，特該院為適合少女心理計，色彩分外艷明，而一種恬靜風光，大致相類，無一片白色以致耀目之弊，該院臥室用具，全用鋼鐵器具，而虹院則用電鍍克羅明之鋼具，不致發銹，則有過之者矣，而於各種之採光設備，走廊之避音設備，每室之壁橱冷熱水管及熱汽管等裝置，亦皆完全相司也。</p>
<p>院長克來司氏之言白，該院成立之年，適値德國遭遇最嚴重之時期，失業問題之嚴重，政局之變化，內憂外息，相因並來，但政府並不以是而廢棄其建設方針，巍巍乎北海之濱之少女療養院，仍依原定計劃而完成之，當時來院之患者，有百分之三十屬於營養不良者，今則已减為百分之十六，於此可見其社會一般情狀之進步矣。住院之平均日數，為四十二天，治療方法，全以天然療養為主旨，不用藥物，如失眠之人，施以溫浴，則多能酣睡矣。但其治療之結果，每以直接的海洋氣候為標準，如在室內緊閉窗戶，不能享受直接海洋氣候者，則結果多不良，故患者尙須注意其能適合於氣候之習慣，蓋海洋氣候之刺激性極大，對於人體旣能發生治療功用，若應用不愼，同時亦能發生危害也。故在何種情形之下、宜來此間療養，乃</p>
<p>讀者試思該院利用近世科學之權威，集多數專家之智力，耗費鉅量之金錢，（每個床位平均計為一萬七千馬克，我國之虹橋療養院，平均計每室為一萬金。）以完成此美麗之少女的天堂，巍巍乎矗立北海之濱，果屬純無缺點之可言乎，曰亦有之，夫國家之建設，以謀公衆之福利為前提也，以平常之店員而論，其平日之生活，以耐勞勤苦者居最多數，乃一旦罹病，令其來此，則養尊處優，如入天國，雖復元可期，若他日復換故業，卽不免有重墮苦境之感，而一切均不能習慣矣，故國家之此種建設其用意雖善，然非公衆所能日日享受也</p>

<p>均一片荒涼之區耳，除天然之海洋氣候外，初無特殊之風景可言，乃德人經之營之，不特成為醫學上療養之要區，且將成為歐北著名之避暑區，每年之前往這暑及療養者，逹數十萬人，以福而一島而言，兒童之往療養者，已年在二萬人以上，其直接則對於病家收莫大之功效，間接則對於其國家不知增盛幾許之生產力，嗚呼，何其盛也。不寗惟是，觀於海白林博士犧牲其畢生之精力，專門研究海洋療養學，以經營該島，且不惜毁其全家，其勇往直前之毅力，與夫研究學術之態度，在在足以令人肅然起敬焉。我國具有最悠久之文化歷史，最沃壤之土地山川，沿海諸島，莫不景物秀美，卽以普陀而論，以遠勝福而島百倍，然而不聞有何種新建設也，豈我華眞無人乎？人力不能勝天乎，抑猶酣睡未醒自暴自棄乎？嗚呼，觀乎海氏之毁家興島，其亦可以興矣。</p>
<h3>辦理農村衛生之因難及解決方針（一）</h3>
<p>— 劉農</p>
<p>在復興農村時期中，衛生也是一樁極重要，而為當代醫學家所公認為急應努力實行的事件，近數年來，當局對農村衛生非常重視，努力不斷地向全國各地農村中推進，作者個人也曾在農村中做了好多時衛生工作，以過去的觀察和經騐，覺有許多困難和城市大不相同，計有十二條提出來，大家討論討論：</p>
<p>農民的知識簡陋：因為農民受過教育的很少，故知識很簡陋，對於灌輸他們的衛生知識，難以接受，因之，效力較小。</p>
<p>迷信太深：數千年來，護神拜佛的思想已深刻地印在他們的腦中，疾病之好歹，都靠鬼神主宰，如將科學治療介紹給他們，他們是很少相信的。</p>
<p>交通不便：鄉村道路崎嶇，非山卽水，一遇天雨，則路上泥濘沒膝，交通工具，一樣全無，故出外工作，大都是靠步行，所以以同樣的工作人員，時間上為行程佔據太多，工作時間减短，成效亦因之减少，工作時間减短，成效亦因之减少，並且有更多的工作，因交通不便，就不易舉行了。</p>
<p>經濟困難：在整個中國農村社會裏，處處都表現着不景氣，因為經濟關係，衛生設備，不得不簡單，死亡率和疾病率自然比較城市增高。</p>
<p>服務於農村的人很少：因為鄉間環境較劣，受經濟的壓制，對於工作人員的待遇較城市為低，而同時在鄉村工作的人困苦多，生活不舒適，樂於在農村工作的人數自然减少，有時因交通不便，一出門走十里八里，是極普通的事，夏天在烈日之下，冬天在雨雪之中，要遇到接產或出診重病時，不能托故不去，吃得了這種苦的人，非有眞正服務的精神，才能幹得，否則只有失敗。</p>
<p>設備簡單：農村因經濟及樸儉關係，一切設備，均趨向簡陋，各項工作不能請專門人員負責，請人必定要請件件多懂多能負責的人，但是在現在辦理農村衛生各地方，他們聘請人員，大多以經濟之多寡為轉移，所請的人，不但要能吃苦耐勞，并且要從簡單的設備中，做出收效的工作，這實在是一件很困難的事件。</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>三，番曼陀羅華Datura　Tatula，L.</p>
<p>Stechapfel（德）Thorn　apple，（英）</p>
<p>（植物）為美洲原產，以後蕃生於各地，一年草也。形狀與曼陀羅華類似。莖帶紫色。葉為卵形，波狀齒牙經緣。花淡紫色。蒴果作卵形，密生長刺。種子作粒狀，黑色。</p>
<p>白花番曼陀羅華D．Stramonium，L.，形狀槪與前種相同，惟莖呈淡綠色，花為白色。</p>
<p>（生藥）曼陀羅葉Folium　Stramonii，係於前述兩種植物開花之時，採集其葉而乾燥之者也。葉為卵圓形，長達二公寸，邊緣彎曲，有鋸齒，其端尖銳，基部作楔形。葉面不帶毛茸。葉柄長約二公分內外。</p>
<p>（成分）葉含有總　Alkaloid約0.4％，其主要成分為HyoscyaminC17H23NO3，傍有少量之　Alkaloid。又含有著量之硝石KNO。</p>
<p>種子含有總　Alkaloid約0.4％，內中以　Hyoscyamin為主。又含有脂肪油約　25％，內中以　Palmitin，Stearin等為主。</p>
<p>（藥用）曼陀羅葉，可用以製喘息烟草。德国藥局方所收载喘息烟草　Folia　Stramonii　nitrati（Asthmakraut）之製法如次。</p>
<p>曼陀羅葉（細切）六〇〇·　炭酸加里一·〇　鹽素酸加里四·〇　硝酸加里二〇〇·　水四〇〇·</p>
<p>先將鹽類溫溶於水，再將葉浸入，使吸收溶液，乾燥卽成。種子適於作　Hyoscyamin　或Atropin之製造原料。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（三八）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一九六問）　牙頸部分，感覺酸痛，應該怎樣治療？</p>
<p>答　如係牙頸部腐融成為槽溝（但不是蛀洞，並不汚黑）而致酸痛時，應該塡補。如係牙肉退縮，牙根露出，以致知覺敏銳時，應該請牙醫生用硝酸銀溶液塗佈。</p>
<p>（第一九七問）　牙齒變了色，能够恢復本來的顏色嗎？</p>
<p>答　牙齒有時因牙髓壞死，或因用丁香油硝酸銀等藥物，或由他種原因而致，或由他種原因而致變成褐黃黑綠等顏色，非常不美觀。如果請牙醫生用適當方法漂白，可以恢復原色。</p>
<p>（第一九八問）　牙齒受打跌等外傷時，應該怎樣醫治？</p>
<p>答　如發生劇烈疼痛時須先止痛，再抽牙髓患牙應該休息，不可咬物，如果外傷很重，發生牙根膜炎及化膿等症時，必須把患牙拔去，如有齒槽骨折斷，也要同時取出</p>
<p>第七節　補牙問題</p>
<p>（第一九九問）　補蛀牙時，用車車牙，會損害牙齒嗎？</p>
<p>答　蛀洞裏的腐蛀部分，如果不車凈，則不能充分消毒，補後結果必不好。所以補蛀牙時的車牙，是有益無害的。</p>
<p>（第二〇〇問）　補牙所用的材料，最普通的是什麼？</p>
<p>答　就是一種帶銀色的合金，尋常呌做銀粉，很為堅固耐用。</p>
<p>（第二〇一問）　前面的牙齒，應該用什麼材料塡補？</p>
<p>答　應該用白色的磁粉。牠有顏色深淡的各種，袛要揀和牙齒顏色相配的磁粉，補上去，就可以和天生的一樣。</p>
<p>（第二〇二問）　水門汀可以用來補牙嗎？</p>
<p>答　水門汀因為耐久的程度稍差，祗適用於補小兒的乳牙，和其他暫時的封塡。</p>
<p>（第二〇三問）　還有什麼材料可以補牙嗎？</p>
<p>答　還有金鑲嵌，合金鑲嵌（和銀粉的合金不同）及磁鑲嵌。這種鑲嵌，系先用臘做成模型，翻砂出來的，補時用水門汀膠連，就可堅固耐用。對於銀粉或磁粉不能補好的大蛀洞，此種鑲嵌，尤為適宜。有時為增加堅固起見，再套上一個金套。此外又可用金箔補牙，極為耐用。但價旣昂貴，手術又很麻煩，普通多不用。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九十二）從腎臟炎說到眼底的變化（上）</p>
<p>解剖學上有所謂泌尿器者。是指腎臟，輸尿管，膀胱，及尿道而言。其中，尤以腎臟最為重要。牠的形狀。恰如蠶豆。分為外緣，內緣，及前後兩面。長徑殆為垂直。下端少向外方。表面滑澤。而呈暗褐赤色。牠的位置。是在腰部的深部。位於第十一肋骨與腸骨櫛的中間。在脊椎柱，橫膈膜的腰部及腰筋的左右兩側。各有一個。腎臟為一種濾淸吸收排泄尿液的特殊臟器。牠能輸送尿液於膀胱。是有輸尿管專司此職。</p>
<p>講到腎臟如何可以發生炎症一層。牠的原因範圍很廣。茲特分條述之如左</p>
<p>傳染性原因　屬於這一種原因的最多。槪發於諸種傳染的經過中或經過後。是卽所謂傳染性急性腎臟炎。例如猩紅熱，實扶的里，肺炎，丹毒，腸梯扶斯，急性關節僂麻質斯，瘧疾，及梅毒等等。常可發生。</p>
<p>寒冷性原因　由這種原因所引起的腎臟炎稱為寒冷性急性腎臟炎</p>
<p>外傷性原因　由這種原因所引起的腎臟炎稱為外傷性急性腎臟炎</p>
<p>傳播性原因　槪由傳播而來。稱為傳播性腎臟炎。普通發於淋疾，膀胱炎，腎盂炎，及腎臟周圍炎等時。</p>
<p>中毒性原因　是由服用藥濟及毒物而起稱為中毒性急性腎臟炎。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>各國高懸休戰白旗</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>十五日羅馬電，本日乃係各國撤銷對意制裁辦法之日，意國全境，自午前八時起至七時半止以一律懸旗，以誌慶祝，墨索里尼於晚間行下旗禮時，御白色制服，向傳聲筒發表廣播演說，音吐淸朗，雜以笑聲！其言曰，本日為七月十五日全世界參加對意制裁辦法之日，各國咸於是日，在其制裁陣綫之壁疊上，高懸休戰白旗，吾人於此所見者，不僅為降服之標識，且亦為常識恢復之兆也云云，意相此種音吐淸朗，雜以笑聲的演說，十足表現首相愉快與勝利的神情，聞者咸歡呼若狂，首相並一再出臨露台，向帬眾答謝，滬上超等名角，唱完大鼓，臨入幕時，聽眾一致高呼「再來一個」，其情形極其相似。</p>
<p>墨索里尼對於各國撤消制裁，為什麽這樣得意呢？天然得意，當墨索里尼對阿用兵時，世界各國，一致反對，國聯會决議意國為侵略國，併决議而且被告對意經濟制裁，尤其是英國，更為激烈，調集艦隊，集中地中海，以示武裝調停，並有封鎖蘇彝士運河之擬議，此時意國的情形，何等嚴重，但是結果為墨索里尼虛聲所恫喝，封鎖政策，亦未實現，居然在九月之中，竟把阿比西尼亞版圖，攫歸墨氏之掌握，這樣冒危險，臨患難，艱難辛苦而成的事業，在墨氏安得而不歡欣不愉快，？</p>
<p>國聯方面為什麽這要撤消封意制裁呢？這是何等煞風景的事情呀！在國聯方面，亦自有不得已的苦衷，墨索里尼深知國聯方面，最怕的是德國，自德國重整軍備以後，英法諸國，知德國的厲害，决非任何一國所能控制，於是倡議集體安全之策，用以控制德國，而集體安全之中，尤以意國有舉重輕之勢，墨氏窺破國聯此種弱點，便高喊着撤消制裁，則德意行將合作，一面耀武揚威，準備犧牲，此種恫嚇，國聯安得而不懼，因為列强對付德國，已經不易，若意德聯盟，不啻為虎生翼，如何了得，法國本欲意國帮忙，對於制裁一事，本來不大贊同，英國到此，亦絕無辦法，只得將國聯决議的制裁案，同意撤消，這事在國聯方面何等失風，在墨氏方面何等得意，宜乎其誇口曰，「全世界對意制裁各國，咸於是日在其制裁陣綫之壁疊上，高懸休戰白旗」。</p>
<p>國聯對意制裁業經撤消矣，而集體安全之制，果能達到目的否乎？曰是不然，不撤消對意制裁，而集體安全之制勢必瓦解，對意撤消制裁，而集體之制更要瓦解，此何以故？墨氏深知列强意見的不一致，與利害的不相同，本無集體可以安全之可能，又知英法諸國，暮氣已深，遇事多所欲慮，這無勇氣，卽使集體安全，亦難得堅强之陣綫，不若與突飛猛進之德國携手，兩雄並立，而重開歐洲的新局面，如是不但可以為所欲為，而意國的地位，亦得藉以增高，所以國聯對於撤消制裁之舉，自表面上看來，似乎上了意國的大當，而在事實上，勢亦不得不如此也，墨索里尼又謂「吾人於此所見者，不僅為降服之標識，是以為常識恢復之兆」其常識為何？卽「以强為勝」四字而已，歐洲局面之演變，我將拭目而觀之。</p>
<h3>車水（二）</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>她句句聽得很淸楚，而且並沒有漏掉一個他所發的鼻音。她只得裝着沒聽見的樣子，然而一字一句，已如粗長的鐵釘，直刺進她胸膛去了。「車水派孩子誰忍心，假使慶生活在世上，還用呌瘦小的孩子去做大人工嗎……「小癆病鬼」……這名字，這名字」她想到這裏眼淚就直拋了。</p>
<p>水車擱在八畝裏牛皮港堤上，毒煞煞的太陽下，車槓上掛着五張背皮，炙曬焦了，兩張是壽根叔家的田夥計的，兩張是順富歪嘴兄弟倆的，另一張是那樣的小而薄脊骨綳出顯露在外面，這不是毛小那孩子的背皮嗎，兩根細腿亦跟緊着其餘八根粗大的腿踏着車軸的鎯頭。</p>
<p>田夥計跟順富歪嘴們都打着調門的號子，毛小嘗不會，可是他不能哼出嘴來，畢身的力氣都用在腿上，胳膊伏在車槓上跟扔烙鐵一樣燙，眼睛前像飛着無數的金蒼蠅，汗從眼皮掛下，汗溢住在短褲腰裏，他還時刻提防着「吃田雜」（被車軸的鎯頭撞腿脚踝骨），而有時，壽根叔家的田夥計硬捉弄他，拚命踏得快，他的脚跟不上，只得吊起來，上不上，下不下，他常常急得號呌着他的媽。</p>
<p>「你媽上土地廟望道士去了。小癆病鬼！」</p>
<p>有時候，田夥計們索性要把他扔在港裏吃一飽水。終於毛小嚇得不敢喊呌，不敢哭，抹抹眼睛爬上水車去，牌子一癟一癟，可憐的苦相。</p>
<p>小中時候，順富歪嘴的老婆送「上茶」來了，壽根叔家的女忙工亦送來了，毛小可沒有誰給他送「上茶」的，想喝別人茶壺裏一口柳葉茶都不許，只好雙手捧些被太陽蒸熱了的水喝下，他的腸子幾乎熱得燒起來，古怪的肚裏多容易餓。他開始怨恨他的媽，「要我做生活又不給我吃。」他坐在水車邊那棵桂楊樹下，忽然又想起明天爸的忌日，有飯，有綫粉湯。有煎豆腐吃了。</p>
<p>毛小似乎忘記暫時的饑餓，他巴望媽打街上帶回一條白魚？（完）</p>

<h3>胡鼻子</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>每天早上，當菜販子從老遠的鎮上挑着滿滿的菜筐列市街來的時候，不論下着雨，刮着風，胡鼻子不遲也不早，拖着一套比他細小的身體要寬大一倍以上的破軍衣，踩着一雙脚跟碰不着鞋沿的大皮鞋，一路唱着不成腔的京調上合與茶館來了。</p>
<p>那是縣成里發生戰事的那一年，胡鼻子被拉去扛槍彈，做一個刀像囚犯一樣的工作，他從一個屍骨身上剝下了那一套寬大的軍衣逃了回來。那件事情胡鼻子常在茶館里誇大口：祗有俺胡鼻子有這膽量！哼，那個灰鬼子的腸子都掛在外面，有一羣蒼蠅在那牢什子上做家，那味兒比腐了的鹹魚都臭上十倍，俺一點也木吹牛，把他翻了個身，一下子就剝了下來，可是那條褲子已開了花，屁股上染着一大堆血漬，像女人的……說到這里胡鼻子高興地笑了起來。</p>
<p>茶館里有人鼓着清脆的掌聲，也有人像戲院子里一樣喝起彩來。這樣，胡鼻子更忘形了，他用大拇指捺着他的酒糟的大鼻子，預備用更穢褻的謊語來胡扯。可是合興老闆從櫃台內洩了出來，他閃到胡鼻子身後，兜手過來扭着他的鼻子說：</p>
<p>「像女人的什麼？像女人的什麼？胡鼻子你說！」</p>
<p>笑聲愈來愈高了。門外呌賣的一個個閃了進來，他們知道胡鼻子在茶館里每天要鬧一點笑話。合興老閭又是個慣擾胡鼻子的敵手。所以從早上到夜晚，合興茶館里總是黑壓壓地坐着來撩牙兒聽新聞的茶客。胡鼻子是不賈茶錢的，每天還要擾老閭三餐飯食。因為胡鼻子能够拉來許多茶館，老閭的故意撩胡鼻子的開心，彷佛雙方的恊定似的。「像女人的什麼？」在胡鼻子的嘴里本來可以扯出一大串話來的，在眾人的笑聲哄起的時候他却祗用大拇指捺着他的酒糟的大鼻子，裝做難為情的樣子，一扭脖子喊燒餅攤上的夥計要兩個燒餅，又像他已經盡了他的義務似的應該收入他的所得的酬報了。但是屋角里另外一個聲音又哄起了更大的笑聲。</p>
<p>「胡鼻子，像你的女人的不像？」</p>
<p>那問話的是挑水阿二，他知道胡鼻子碰着放白鴿的把戲，當阿二當眾宣佈那幕喜劇的時候，胡鼻子也冒過火，他的鼻子像一個紅蘿蔔那樣地火了起來，他扭住阿二的那條又粗又大的手臂，他的細小的身體在那寬大的破軍衣里更顯得毫無着落了，祗見他的兩條細小的腿在地上蹦着跳着，像一只老鼠。阿二故意運足氣工，站起身起來，擋空手臂旋圈子。胡鼻子雖然緊抓着阿二的手臂，但是旋得猛烈的時候，他終於一條蚯蚓似的被摔在遠遠的地上了。</p>
<p>半嚮，胡鼻子坐不起身來，他的眼前飛着閃光的金星，面色又紅變白，胡鼻子就那樣發過一次瘋，他奔到燒餅攤前搶了柄切麺的板刀向阿二奔去，合興老閭見要闖出人命來，他老鷹提小鷄的把胡鼻子合身一抱，鎖在後面小房子里。</p>
<p>這回事後，胡鼻子的笑話更多了。胡鼻子的名聲老遠地傳散開去，到市街來的人都要在合興茶館里泡壺茶來見見那位風趣的人物。</p>
<p>胡鼻子今年已經三十開外了。他本來是做小買賣的，也時常到合興茶館里做賣買。那時候他的那個酒糟鼻子已經在生意上佔很大的便宜了。茶客們喜歡和他撩開心，他的賣買就特別好起來。胡鼻子慢慢積起幾個錢，就想娶老婆，不知他在什麼地方偷偷摸摸被歹人串騙了放白鴿，那把戲他以為是很秘密的，却被挑水阿二在茶館里講了出來。</p>
<p>但是胡鼻子對女人沒有斷過念頭，他一積起幾個錢，又上什麼地方去逛了，漸漸連做賣買的本錢都丟了，於是他每天拉著那套破軍衣到合興茶館里坐地，由許多人在自己身上找笑料，騙老闆的三餐飯。現在總是他自己故意談起女人的笑話，把他的老婆的放白鴿的故事由人家來接腔，博得茶館里賣滿座，那些茶客們高興。他像一件貨品一樣，被侮辱和諷刺在市街上出賣着。</p>
<h3>騷動</h3>
<p>— 雪野</p>
<p>—旅途雜記之一</p>
<p>四面盡是遼闊無際的平野，火車馳走的速度雖還是一樣，可是在視覺里却好似是遲緩些了。時間已是將近黃昏，但那夏日的夕陽，却還是像火盤般的放射出刺肉的熱光。從雨後積水的田里，那一排排整齊的綠色底新苗的空隙間反射出來的光綫，在原野間就好像是直堅起來般的萬條金光在窗外閃耀的旋轉着。這時的原野是靜寂着，只有車輪的聲音響亮地在奏着旅人們的進行曲。</p>
<p>漸漸地已近黃昏了，太陽沒入在遠方平原的地平綫下反映在西方天際的彩霞雖還在閃亮，但飛流在天空上的黑色的薄雲，却向着大地上投下了灰色的暗影了。這時車廂里的旅客們有的已在吃着晚餐，有的却忙亂的整理着行裝準備着下一站的下車，車廂里是很嘈雜的動亂着。</p>
<p>尖銳而響亮的警笛，衝破了黃昏原野的靜寂，在列車的最後狂鳴，這聲音，這刺耳的響亮，把一長串的軍廂里的人聲壓住了，就連那機輪軋動的聲響，也似乎受到了恐怖而低弱了。人的臉，在靜默之中個個的現出了莫明其妙的驚怕底顏色，心和呼吸也在急遽的悸動着。一刹那的靜默，又開始的騷動起來，車廂的窗上，人的頭在愰動着，車輪的聲音也與警笛同時的停止了。</p>
<p>從車長室的車廂里跳下了一大羣的人，一個個地現着驚慌的臉色向着列車的後面走去，旅客的車廂里也一陣騷動起來，從一個個的車門上，跳下了一羣羣的人，騷動的人聲，這時佔有了原野的世界。</p>
<p>經過了十分鐘的停止，響了一聲汽笛，車輪又轆轆地前進了，同時列車上的每一車廂里，也嘈雜地喧鬧起來了。</p>
<p>「好在還沒有跌死，要是死了那可麻煩呢！」</p>
<p>「跌下去他還會走哩！他還帶着一個很大的被包，真危險呀！」</p>
<p>「聽車里人說，他是在最後第三節車跳下去的，所以看得很清楚。」</p>
<p>「看他的樣子窮得得呢，……做這種危險事真也可憐。」</p>
<p>無原則的東一句西一句的流進耳里，旅途是寂寞的，旅客們用着剛才發生的事件作為談笑的資料是一直的繼續着。</p>
<p>夜是到來了，襲進旅人們的心扉的更是無限的寂寞了，這時望着黑色一片的原野，想像着一點鐘以前的事件，心里也像黑夜的天空一般，蒙上了一層黑色的雲塊。</p>
<p>—為了沒有錢，為了怕查票的唾罵，為了生存，終於把生命在危險的事件上拼命。這就是人生，這就是今日的現實社會了。</p>

<h3>British Newspaper's Thoughts on the Guangdong Incident</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers have all reported on the collapse of the Guangdong Province mutiny incident, but because attention has been absorbed by the Spanish civil war, there are no comments on it in the newspapers. The price of Chinese bonds today is very stable, and it is clear that it has not been affected by recent events, but transactions are narrow and it is difficult to cope with large purchases. Experienced observers do not believe that a civil war will really break out in China. Chinese and foreign people who have been to China have solemnly stated that the anti-internal strife sentiment among young, lower-ranking officers in China is very significant. British newspapers have expressed regret over Chen Jitang's departure and have mourned Chen's friendly relations with Hong Kong over the years, but they all agree that China's primary goal at present is the unified administration of the central government. All newspapers hope that the Nanjing government can extend the currency reform to South China in the future, and also exercise greater jurisdiction over the smuggling situation there, and reap beneficial results.

<h3>The Montreux Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>The Montreux Conference, which discussed the issue of fortifying the Turkish Straits, has now concluded successfully since its opening on the 22nd of last month after a period of stagnation and countless arguments. The new Straits Convention was signed in Montreux City at 10 pm last night. Its main contents are as follows. (1) Merchant ships of all countries shall be free to pass through, whether in peacetime or wartime. (2) Warships belonging to countries not bordering the Black Sea may enter the Straits in peacetime or stay in the Black Sea, but are limited to 30,000 tons. However, submarines and aircraft carriers are not allowed to pass through the Straits. (3) In wartime, warships belonging to neutral countries may pass freely, provided that Turkey is also a neutral country. As for warships belonging to belligerent countries, they are not allowed to pass through the Straits, except those carrying out orders of the League of Nations Council or fulfilling regional conventions, provided that Turkey has signed and joined this regional convention. (4) Turkey may prohibit foreign warships from passing through the Straits at will when it considers there is a danger of war. (5) Abolish the International Management Committee of the Straits. (6) After the new convention is signed, Turkey may re-establish defensive fortifications on both sides of the Straits.</p>
<p>The successful outcome of the Montreux Conference and the conclusion of the new convention are a great victory for Turkish diplomacy. All provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne that infringed upon the sovereignty of the country have been swept away in the new convention. To cite the most important ones, the Treaty of Lausanne stipulated that the coasts of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus Straits should be demilitarized and the Straits should be managed by a special international committee, while the new one allows the country to establish defenses on both sides of the Straits and abolish the International Management Committee. The Treaty of Lausanne stipulated that in wartime, if Turkey is a neutral country, all kinds of warships of all countries, in addition to being subject to tonnage restrictions in peacetime, may still pass freely day and night. The so-called all countries naturally include belligerent countries. The new treaty stipulates that warships of all belligerent countries shall not be allowed to pass through unless they fulfill the obligations of the League of Nations and regional agreements. The new treaty also stipulates that submarines and aircraft carriers are not allowed to pass through the Straits. Military aircraft are also not allowed to fly over the Straits. Compared with the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey has won a great victory in the Montreux Conference.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the new convention is not only a victory for Turkey, but also a victory for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has always supported the country's request to fortify the Straits, and has insisted on allowing the Black Sea Fleet to freely enter the Mediterranean during wartime. In this Montreux Conference, there was a serious conflict with Britain over this issue, almost leading to the breakdown of the conference. The reason why the Soviet Union insisted on sealing off the Straits in wartime was to consolidate its first line of defense. The reason why Britain opposed the blockade of the Straits and the free entry of the Black Sea Fleet into the Mediterranean during wartime was to exert its Mediterranean naval power in wartime and open a large number of warships into the Black Sea as soon as possible to extinguish its possible enemies. At the same time, its Mediterranean hegemony would not be threatened by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. However, later, due to the mediation of France and the concession of Britain, the Soviet Union's position finally won the final victory.</p>
<p>The reason why Britain made concessions to the Soviet Union was largely due to the refusal of Italy to participate in the conference. Italy took an opposing attitude towards the restoration of the fortification of the Straits because of its own interests. Britain originally hoped that after the League of Nations resolution to lift sanctions against Italy, Italy could participate in the Montreux Conference and take a common attitude with it. However, Italy not only insisted that it could not participate in international conferences unless all sanctions against Italy (such as the Mediterranean Naval Mutual Assistance Agreement) were lifted, but also colluded with Germany to draw Germany and Austria together to conclude a friendship agreement. Under these circumstances, if Britain insisted on its own position, it would not only prevent the Montreux Conference from succeeding, but also deal a major blow to actions seeking to amend treaties by legal means. This would indirectly encourage Germany's unilateral abolition and disrupt the international rule of law. Therefore, for various reasons, Britain resolutely made concessions to the Soviet Union, and the Montreux Conference turned sharply and was successfully completed.</p>
<p>The process and results of the Montreux Conference not only made a significant contribution to the peace of the Near East, but also increased the strength of the collective security system. This is naturally a major blow to Italy, which wants to expand its power in the Near East, and Germany, which has always prided itself on being anti-Soviet. After the signing of the Montreux Convention, the division between the aggressive front and the peace front in Europe will become more obvious, and the outbreak of a future massacre will be closer.</p>

Attendees included Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Cheng Qian, Wang Yongbin, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and commissions of the National Government, totaling approximately 400 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then gave an impromptu speech on the importance of national economic construction. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM after the speech. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin delivered a speech on "The Importance of National Economic Construction" at the National Government Commemorative Week on the morning of the 20th. He first analyzed in detail the fundamental reasons why China's economy has not developed in the past hundred years. Then, he described the reasons for the economic difficulties China has faced in recent years. He further stated that the soundness of a nation's economy is of great importance to the survival and development of that nation. The current state of China's national economy is perilous, causing people to live in poverty, making it difficult to stabilize social order, and making it difficult to balance financial revenues and expenditures. This phenomenon is naturally a major blow to the nation's survival and development. If we want to revive the nation, we must first find ways to improve this foundation of national survival. The scope of national economic construction is extremely broad, but in essence, it is nothing more than seeking a fundamental solution to the people's livelihood problem. Its object is the improvement of the lives of all people, which is the realization of the Three Principles of the People, with the Principle of People's Livelihood as its goal. He continued that the construction of the national economy consists of no more than two paths: one is proactive, which is to create production; the other is passive, which is to practice thrift. If we can follow both paths simultaneously, it will be easier to achieve the goal. Finally, he stated that the work of national economic construction is extremely arduous. If we want to complete this work, we must have the unified participation and joint efforts of the entire nation, from top to bottom. He believes that the results will be remarkable in the future. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng's report at the Central Commemorative Week on the 20th contained the following main points: The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, based on a peaceful approach and a strict attitude, resolved the Guangdong-Guangxi problem. This was of course because the Central Government had put in a lot of effort, but it was also the result of local areas deeply understanding that the government and military orders of China must be unified now, and working together to that end. We must not slacken in the future, but must be doubly cautious, united in sincerity, and work hard to overcome national difficulties. At this plenary session, this brother had a proposal to establish an agency to regulate the people's food supply. With this perfect system, we can be prepared in times of famine and prevent low grain prices from hurting farmers in times of plenty. I personally believe that the following points are necessary for the regulation issue to be resolved satisfactorily, namely: (1) good seeds to increase production, estimating the amount of land so that it can circulate freely; (2) exploring a cooperative spirit to determine sales channels; (3) developing transportation, reducing freight costs, and removing unlimited embargoes to ensure smooth flow; (4) the government should set grain prices to eliminate exploitation and issue securities to increase purchasing power. The above points are my personal opinion, which I hope all comrades will study. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Imposes Income Tax: To Be Implemented on the First of Next Month</h3>

<h3>National Government Issues Order: Equality for Men and Women in National Elections; General Office of National Elections Informs All Election Supervisors</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The women's circles petitioned the government to reiterate the clear announcement that, in the execution of various elections, all male and female citizens who are legally entitled to vote or be elected should be treated equally without discrimination. The Executive Yuan forwarded this to the National Government. On the 20th, the National Government specially ordered the General Office of the National Assembly Delegates to inform all election supervisors to pay attention to the following original order: This is an order for instructions. According to the Executive Yuan's No. 1563 report on June 26, 1936, Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Period of Political Tutelage states, "Citizens of the Republic of China are equal before the law, without distinction as to sex, race, religion, or class." Article 8 of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China states, "The people of the Republic of China are equal before the law." The rights and obligations of the people are equal before the law, with no distinction between men and women. However, recently, representatives elected by the women's circles came to the Executive Yuan to petition, claiming that although the National Assembly Delegate Election Law promulgated by the National Government and the implementing regulations passed by the Executive Yuan granted male and female citizens equal rights to vote and be elected, the social customs of our country for many years have not seen equal rights and obligations for men and women in practice. If there is no clear announcement, it is feared that there will be misunderstandings when executing various elections in the future, leading to discriminatory treatment, which would be inconsistent with the original intention of the law. They requested that the National Government, when the General Office of the National Assembly Delegate Election is established in the future, clearly order the office to inform all legal election supervisors that, in the execution of elections, all male and female citizens who are legally entitled to vote or be elected should be treated equally without discrimination, in accordance with the intention of the law. Therefore, this official document is prepared and submitted for your review and implementation. In view of this, in addition to instructing that the submitted documents should be acknowledged in full, it is hereby ordered that the General Office of the National Assembly Delegate Election should be instructed to forward the instructions for notification. This order! (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th. He said that the Guangdong-Guangxi affair has been resolved, which is truly a blessing for the country. If the authorities in Guangxi Province can clearly express their obedience to the Central Government, then the internal stability of the country will be further consolidated. After the establishment of the General Office of National Elections, due to the urgent proximity of the National Assembly period, it has directly ordered the provinces and cities to establish election offices as soon as possible to handle all election matters. In general, the citizen oath registration can be completed before August 15th, and the preliminary elections are expected to be completed by the end of September. As for whether it can be completed as planned in practice, it is not yet certain, but the General Office is determined to do its best to ensure that the National Assembly opens on schedule. The recent resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi affair will undoubtedly facilitate the progress of the elections. The date for the inauguration ceremony of the Director and Deputy Directors of the General Office has not yet been determined. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Spain to Restore the Monarchy: National Banks Said to Have Suspended Cash Payments; 6,000 Refugees Arrive in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>London: General Franco, the leader of the current Spanish rebels, has made the restoration of the monarchy one of the aims of his uprising. Alfonso, who was forced to abdicate and leave the country in April 1931, may be restored to the throne. It is reported that Franco has telegraphed the government, saying that the Spanish restoration movement will be completely victorious within days. Franco also opposes the bombing of Moroccan civilians by aircraft and asks the government to end the pointless bloodshed. The revolutionary movement is gaining momentum. Franco's telegram has naturally attracted much attention.</p>
<p>At the same time, London received a telegram stating that the Spanish destroyer Churruca was driven out of Spanish Melilla and engaged in combat with the rebels, and bombarded the town of Cádiz (note: the town is the most beautiful place in Spain). There was a shooting incident in San Sebastián today, with some deaths and injuries. The two islands of Las Palmas and Tenerife in the Canary Islands are now under the control of the military authorities. Workers who started a general strike have been ordered to resume work tomorrow. Also, the report that General Franco has landed in the port of Cádiz has not yet been confirmed. Seville has now fallen into the hands of the rebels. The local radio station issued a message at 2:30 AM this morning, stating that Andalusia, Castile, Aragon, and Navarre have all been occupied by the revolutionary army. There is currently no news from Galicia, Asturias, Catalonia, and Madrid. London received a telegram from Gibraltar relayed from the Spanish capital, stating that all Spanish banks suspended transactions for forty-eight hours and have now announced the suspension of cash payments.</p>
<p>Residents of the town of La Línea near Gibraltar are terrified that fascist aviators will attack the extreme rebel faction that has not yet surrendered in the town, so they are all fleeing in panic. More than 6,000 people have now arrived in Gibraltar. Two tugboats of the British Navy sailed from Gibraltar to Malaga today to carry British nationals out of the country. At the same time, Spanish Morocco has become tranquil because the chieftain opposed attacking Ceuta and other places and intervened. Non-Spanish vehicles are allowed to pass, but all kinds of Spanish vehicles have been requisitioned by the authorities. The attitude of the three Spanish warships anchored in Tangier is doubtful. According to a telegram from Porto, unrest is brewing in San Sebastián. Thugs are indiscriminately shooting from the windows of hotels with pistols, injuring many people. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Madrid - The situation in the capital is extremely precarious. Although the authorities claim that Madrid is calm as usual and there are no incidents, sporadic gunfire has occurred and only ceased after a long period. The government announced that soldiers who do not sympathize with their officers are free to leave their posts. Consequently, hundreds of soldiers took the opportunity to desert and surrender to the authorities. Trucks filled with civilians carrying rifles, pistols, and swords are patrolling the streets of the capital. Miners from northwestern Spain arrived in the capital today on several trucks to offer their services and are willing to fight for the government. Tonight, Madrid issued a public statement saying that rebels in Barcelona attempted to raid a prison but were repelled by loyal army aircraft. Another report states that two rebel regiments attacked the city of Cadiz, and the provincial governor and other provincial authorities are now besieged in the city hall. According to a public statement released by the authorities today, the government is capable of controlling the overall situation, and the main naval force still supports the government.

All Spanish towns near this port have been brought under their control. Local trade union members and communists are putting up strong resistance. The rebel army is still using machine guns and old cannons to fire at them. The crackling sound continues throughout the night, clearly audible here. It is reported that there have been numerous deaths on both sides, and hundreds of injuries. Residents seeking refuge here have reached a total of 3,000, mostly arriving in small boats along the coast. Many of the children they bring are poorly clothed and hungry. Local people are providing as much assistance as possible. It has recently been learned that [Moroccan official] General Kindelan flew to the city of Algeciras, not far from here, last night. General Franco, the commander-in-chief, is scheduled to arrive there tomorrow to personally direct military operations in the surrounding area. The city is said to have surrendered to the rebels, but broadcasts from Madrid still claim that the navy is loyal to the republican government and is prepared to prevent the landing of Moroccan rebels and will launch a fierce attack at the first opportunity. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Tangier - Various messages from radio stations in Seville, Cadiz, and Ceuta, Spanish cities (all occupied by the rebels), have recently been received here. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A telegram from General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Moroccan rebels, to General Queipo de Llano, commander of the Seville garrison, was broadcast by the Seville radio station. It stated, "I have assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief in Tetouan (capital of Spanish Morocco). All honorable and patriotic troops are under my command. I hereby earnestly request that all troops throughout Spain and Morocco loyal to the government immediately come over to our side." The telegram also stated that the garrisons and security forces in the Spanish mainland provinces of Andalusia, Valencia, Valladolid, Burgos, Aragon, and the Canary and Balearic Islands have all joined the anti-government movement. The only exception is the capital city of Madrid. The government has now dispatched numerous aircraft to bomb undefended towns, killing countless women and children, which is inhumane and should be severely punished.</p>
<p>The message stated that Commander-in-Chief General Franco arrived here this afternoon and was warmly welcomed by the local people.</p>
<p>A radio message from Cadiz, Spain, stated that General Pinto, the garrison commander there, recently issued an order that any resident who privately possesses firearms or attempts to endanger lives or damage public institutions will be executed without mercy.

<h3>US Silver Purchase Program, Senate Investigation Committee to Prepare Report</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned here today that the Senate Silver Investigation Committee intends to prepare a report in November, after the presidential election, explaining the improvement of relations between China and the United States after the signing of the silver agreement between the two countries. The chairman of the committee, Senator Pittman, has decided to convene a meeting of the committee members before the new Congress convenes in January next year to conclude the investigation report of the past two years. According to responsible sources, Pittman is convinced that the Sino-American agreement has greatly reduced criticism of the silver purchase program in the United States and has changed China's attitude towards the program. Other silver senators also said that American public opinion has gradually become favorable to the silver program because the Sino-American agreement has allowed the United States to move away from London and purchase silver from China and other silver-producing countries. Impartial observers who previously believed that the program was detrimental to China's interests have also changed their views, saying that the silver purchase program is actually beneficial to China.

<h3>Locarno Question, Britain, France, and Belgium to Re-negotiate, and Will Discuss Danzig Question</h3>

<p>(London) The prime ministers and foreign affairs authorities of Britain, France, and Belgium are scheduled to hold a Locarno conference in London on the 22nd of this month. At that time, the issue of the Free City of Danzig will also be raised for informal discussion. There is no doubt about this. The measures recently adopted by the authorities of the city, namely the abolition of various freedoms enshrined in the constitution, are in effect a coup d'état. As for what kind of reaction there is in British official circles, it is impossible to know because all the important people went to other places for rest at the end of the week. It is now learned that the staff of the Foreign Office will study the opinions of various parties on the city of Danzig tomorrow and prepare a detailed report in a short time to be submitted to Foreign Secretary Eden and forwarded to Prime Minister Baldwin, so that the Prime Minister can decide whether to convene an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the matter or to deal with it through ordinary diplomatic channels. Political figures here attach great importance to the measures taken by the Danzig government and are asking what actions the Polish government will take on this matter. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) After the authorities of the Free City of Danzig decided to abolish various freedoms enshrined in the constitution, Foreign Secretary Eden, who is the current chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, should decide whether to convene an emergency meeting of the Council or to convene representatives of Britain, France, and Portugal to hold a meeting. (The Council has previously resolved to appoint representatives of Britain, France, and Portugal to study the Danzig issue together with Poland.) If it is decided to convene a meeting of the Council, the Locarno conference, which was originally scheduled to be held here, should be moved to Geneva to avoid a conflict of time. Regarding this matter, French Ambassador Corbin explained to Foreign Secretary Eden this morning that his country is very concerned about both the Locarno case and the Danzig issue. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - According to news obtained here, the situation in the Free City of Danzig is still relatively calm. Various demonstrations are planned to be held in various places in Poland, such as Krakow, Katowice, and Lviv, to oppose Germany's ambitions for the city of Danzig. In addition, General Dorelzner, president of the Polish Naval Colonial Association, recently crashed into the sea and died in an airplane accident off the port of Gdynia. The funeral will be held there tomorrow, and President Mościcki will personally attend the funeral. Dorelzner is responsible for most of the work in developing the Polish navy and air force. During tomorrow's funeral, the participants will take the opportunity to hold a demonstration to prove that Poland should also be among the naval powers. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Suppression of Northern Smuggling: Japan and Jews Have No Intention to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Regarding assistance with smuggling in North China, Japan and the Jews have no intention of cooperating with our suppression efforts. Diplomatic circles believe that if Ambassador Kawagoe can reach a solution with us, the Japanese side can thoroughly suppress the vagrants and eliminate smuggling. Otherwise, they will continue to adhere to their policy of not protecting and not interfering. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: In the past week, fewer smuggled goods have been transshipped from Tianjin to Japan via the south. More than ten firms established by smuggling vagrants in the Japanese concession, such as Sanxiang Yanghang and Haixin Yanghang, have suffered excessive losses and have closed down. The remaining dozens are also struggling. Several Jin bank money shops have closed down because they accepted artificial silk and sugar as collateral from smuggling vagrants. The loans for each bag of sugar were nine yuan, and now, including interest, they have exceeded the market price, resulting in unsustainable losses. As a result, even if the vagrants want to guarantee loans with cash, no one cares. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Vagrant Trade Association stated that the special trade goods transported southwards are subject to strict inspections by the inspection offices on the southern sections of the Pinghan and Jinpu railways, making it impossible to transport them smoothly. Currently, the only way is the Tianjin-Jinan section. The various special trade merchants have little hope and will request the Jidong government to guarantee the southbound route, as the goods have already paid the relevant taxes when shipped from Jidong. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Customs has received an order from the Ministry of Finance stipulating that the informant's bonus for smuggling reports will be issued at 50%, but the amount of the bonus received shall not exceed the value of the smuggled goods after they are landed.

<h3>Taxation on Stock Interest Income</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Various trade associations in Shanghai have listed five points in the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax that should be amended and submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for transfer to the Central Political Council for review. Regarding the point that stock interest income should not be taxed, a certain financial expert recently expressed his opinion that there is no double taxation in theory when taxing stock interest income, because companies and shareholders are two separate entities. A company is a legal person, and a shareholder is a person. Legal persons and people enjoy dual rights to the state, and their obligations should also be dual. Therefore, taxing the company's profit income in addition to taxing the shareholder's stock interest income is definitely not double taxation. Furthermore, Britain, the United States, and France all adopt this legislative example, and it is not an original creation of our country. As for the claim that the tax rate for this dual taxation in the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax passed by the Legislative Yuan is too high, it is not a legislative issue but a policy issue, because the government's taxation on capital profit income should be heavier than that on labor income. In addition, the regulations have a provision that interest income from statutory savings funds of civil servants and workers should be tax-exempt. According to the current various labor laws and regulations, there are no such regulations. It is hoped that the authorities will have a clear explanation after the promulgation and implementation of these regulations, so as to follow them. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Explains the Measures for Shin Hsin to Hire Temporary Workers</h3>

Do the provisions of Articles 27 and 29 of the Factory Law apply? The ministry has now explained as follows: The temporary worker cards issued by Shin Hsin No. 1 Factory do not specify a time period. If the workers continue to work in the factory for more than three months, they can be handled in accordance with Interpretation No. 1155 of the Judicial Yuan. If the oral contract does not specify a period, the provisions of Article 27 of the Factory Law naturally apply. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang's Last Struggles Before Resigning: Plans to Convene an Extraordinary Meeting to Form a New Government; Chen and Li Sworn in as Commander and Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces; Telegram to Hong Kong Inviting Chiang and Tsai to Reorganize the 19th Route Army; No Fighting in Shaozhou, Guangxi Troops Transferred to the North River</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee decided to remove Chen Jitang from all his concurrent posts and simultaneously abolish the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Council, Chen and Li Bai of Guangxi initially intended to make a last-ditch struggle and seize the opportunity to develop a new situation in the Southwest. In the political aspect, they planned to establish a new government for resisting Japan and saving the nation. On the 15th, the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Council issued a declaration denying all the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. They planned that members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees remaining in Guangdong would convene an extraordinary meeting in Guangzhou. They intended to convene overseas and domestic executive and supervisory committees, imitating the previous four sessions of the Central Committee held in Guangdong, where they convened an extraordinary meeting. In addition to the central committee members, representatives from all regions were welcome to participate. On the 17th, the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Council held a meeting and resolved to establish a secretariat for the extraordinary meeting to start preparations. The opening date for the extraordinary meeting was set for August 1st. Reception centers for representatives from various provinces would be established before the meeting. Notices were issued to overseas and domestic organizations and groups in various provinces to convene meetings and elect representatives to attend the extraordinary meeting as soon as possible. After receiving the notices, various groups in Guangdong Province held meetings to elect representatives. The intention of convening the extraordinary meeting was to create a national government for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Chen Jitang favored Xiao Focheng as the chairman of the extraordinary meeting. However, Xiao Focheng recently suffered a recurrence of his old illness and had left Guangzhou for Hong Kong a few days ago. Therefore, Chen specially sent Lin Yizhong and Zhang Renmin to Hong Kong to urge Xiao to return to Guangdong, but they were unsuccessful. However, Chen, Li Bai, and others were determined to push forward with the formation of the government, not realizing that Chen could not sustain it for long.</p>
<p>At this time, Chen and Li Bai had organized the Allied Forces General Headquarters of the First and Fourth Group Armies of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. They established the Allied Forces General Headquarters at the Shijing Arsenal, appointing Zhang Guoyuan as the director of the office. On the morning of the 16th, Chen and Li held a swearing-in ceremony in the auditorium of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, taking office as Commander and Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces of the First and Fourth Group Armies. Hundreds of Guangdong and Guangxi officials attended the ceremony. Liu Luyin, sent by the Political Affairs Council, was the supervisor of the ceremony. Chen and Li made oaths. After the oaths were completed, the supervisor delivered a speech, followed by Chen and Li, who gave their replies. Thus, the inauguration came to an end.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen and Li Bai sought to strengthen their forces, repeatedly consulting with Chiang Guangnai and Tsai Tingkai, former generals of the 19th Route Army. While Lin Yizhong and Zhang Renmin went to Hong Kong to persuade Xiao Focheng to return to Guangdong, they also visited Chiang and Tsai, eager to restore the 19th Route Army. On the 17th, the Southwest Political Affairs Council formally sent a telegram to Hong Kong inviting Chiang and Tsai to take on this arduous task. As for all the soldiers of the restored 19th Route Army, they were entirely reorganized from the Guangxi provincial militia, with the expenses borne by Guangdong Province. The Guangxi provincial militia, which was prepared to form the army, had already been arriving in Guangdong from Guangxi in a steady stream, numbering about 15,000 men. Unexpectedly, this measure ultimately became an empty promise.</p>
<p>In military terms, the area north of the river was the most tense before the 18th. This road was the necessary route for Yu Hanmou's troops to enter Guangdong. Chen Jitang's troops stationed in the Shaozhou and Lechang areas retreated in stages without contacting Yu's troops. Rumors that fighting had broken out in Shaozhou were inaccurate. However, the busy military transportation on the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway day and night was unprecedented. Furthermore, Chen and Li Bai initially decided to shorten the defense line in order to hold out for a long time. Therefore, they successively withdrew the Guangdong troops stationed in Shaoguan to the areas of Yingde, Qingyuan, Jiangkou, Yuantan, Juntian, and Wengyuan, and assigned the Guangxi troops to be the vanguard in the North River operations. Weng Zhaoyuan's division of more than 10,000 men was quickly transferred to Guangdong to assist in the battle. On the night of the 15th, they took the route through the Xiaobei River in Guangdong from Guangxi and headed to Lechang and Shaozhou. Another division of Guangxi troops, the 44th Division of Wang Zanbin, and a division led by Zhou Zumian, took the route through Wuzhou, going east and southward, from Sanshui to the north of Yingde, all the way to Maba, Wushi, and south of Shaozhou, to serve as the vanguard of the Southwest Anti-Japanese Army. However, since the withdrawal of Chen Jitang's troops from Shaozhou on the evening of the 15th, the city was in a state of panic for a night. On the morning of the 16th, the First Division of Yu Hanmou's troops led a team into the city and issued a notice to reassure the people. Therefore, it can be said that no fighting occurred in Shaoguan, which was fortunate.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's troops in the East River area also adopted an internal defense strategy. The Fourth and Third Armies of Guangdong on the Fujian border had abandoned the border defense areas between Fujian and Guangdong and were about to concentrate heavy troops in Xingning, Lianping, and Heping to coordinate with the military operations in the North River. However, the officers and soldiers of all armies were disgusted with the civil war. Therefore, Chen Jitang was finally forced to resign and leave Guangdong on the evening of the 18th. The tense situation in Guangdong at that time also eased at this point.</p>
<h3>Smuggling in North China to Have a Solution; Number of Smuggled Goods Arriving in Jinan Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Smuggling in North China has been going on for two months, and the numbers are alarming. Taking the smuggled goods transported from Tianjin to Jinan as an example, in addition to several military transports of over a thousand tons of white sugar, almost every one of the 305 trains on the Pingpu line daily contained smuggled goods. At most, there were eight or nine hundred pieces per day. On several occasions, the train cars were damaged. At the least, there were also dozens of pieces. The average was two or three hundred pieces, which was the most common. As of now, there are no fewer than twenty or thirty thousand pieces. The most common type is rayon, followed by white sugar and cigarette paper, then cloth and needles, and occasionally rubber shoes, ironware, and dyes. Jinan City has long been overflowing with them. In the past three or four days, the trend seems to have subsided slightly, with only a few dozen pieces per day. The Japanese police monitor and register the goods at the station every day. It is said that legitimate Japanese merchants are very opposed to smuggling. This is probably the main reason for the reduction in smuggled goods. According to the police sent to the station by the Japanese Consulate, the consulate no longer allows smuggling. Those that have already been transported are only allowed to be unloaded once. All smuggled goods are stored in hotels after being unloaded and are not allowed to be sold privately. Judging from this situation, the problem of smuggling in North China may have found a solution. It is hoped that the transportation of smuggled goods to Jinan will disappear, and the reality may not be far away. Today (the 18th), 68 pieces of smuggled goods were transported from Tianjin to Jinan, including 13 pieces of rayon, 25 pieces of cigarette paper, and 27 pieces of cloth.</p>
<p>In addition, Kimura Yoshito, the Japanese Chief of Transportation of the Jiaoji Railway, came to Jinan from Qingdao to inspect and contact the Japanese Consulate to stop the transportation of smuggled goods eastward on the Jiaoji Railway. It is said that Kimura's contacts in Jinan were successful. Before leaving, he instructed the railway staff not to allow any smuggled goods to be transported eastward. If any illegal Koreans forcibly load the goods, they should notify the Japanese Consulate by telephone to send personnel to the station to stop them.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Opening of Monks' and Taoists' Training Class</h3>
<p>The county government presented it to the Second District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office for approval to hold a training class for monks and Taoists. It first started with the temples in the city. The county magistrate and the chief of the Public Security Bureau served as the director and deputy director, respectively. Shen Zongliang, secretary of the county, served as the training director, and Wang Tou, director of the anti-smoking bureau, served as the dean of studies.

The monks and Taoists receiving training are very excited. It is said that the nuns in various nunneries will also participate in the training.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Two Bizarre Cases of Sucking Essence</h3>
<p>Two bizarre cases of masters sucking the essence of child apprentices have recently occurred in Suzhou. The details are as follows: Lu Fuming, a partner of the Chunyangtai Tea and Fruit Store outside Xumen Street, has a hidden illness and no wife. Qian Xingyuan, an apprentice in the store, 21 years old, shared a room with Lu. Last summer, he felt someone sucking his private parts in his sleep. At that time, he suspected it was a demon, so he did not say anything. However, his body became weaker day by day. According to the doctor, it was caused by masturbation. Until recently, in the middle of the night, Qian Xingyuan felt someone taking off his pants and sucking his essence in his dream. He got up and saw that it was Lu Fuming. His suspicion was finally confirmed. Lu Fuming did not allow Qian Xingyuan to say anything at the time. The next day, he returned home and told his parents about the incident, crying. His father, Qian Shoubao, arranged to meet with Lu Fuming at the Jingge Teahouse on Lindun Road in the evening of the 19th to discuss the matter. Because Lu denied it outright, he twisted him to the police precinct and sent him to the sub-bureau. Qian Shoubao and others were ordered to return, and Lu Fuming was detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 20th. Zhang, the section chief, interrogated him. Lu claimed that Qian Xingyuan stole snacks and he beat him, so he maliciously framed him. He was sent to the district attorney's office for interrogation. Wu Yifei, the owner of the Xinchang Cigarette Paper Store at Baiting Bridge on Shantang Street outside Xumen, sucked the essence of his apprentices Zhang and Li Xingqing. Zhang has already been given money and sent back to Hangzhou. Li Xingqing is being treated at Ruan Jiemin Hospital because of his weakness. He recently filed a complaint with the district attorney's office, accusing Wu Yifei. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, the district attorney's office summoned the plaintiff and defendant to court for questioning. Prosecutor Shan Lüwenqin opened the court for investigation. The plaintiff presented a discount card for 30 yuan of medicine and two boxes of Solid Essence Pills sent by the defendant, as well as a doctor's diagnosis as evidence. The defendant denied the matter. As a result, the court ordered the defendant Wu Yifei to be detained and the plaintiff to be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Silk Workers' Strike Expected to be Resolved</h3>
<p>The strike in our city has lasted for six days. After the political change and the repeated persuasion and mediation of Provincial Special Commissioner Zhang Gongren, work was resumed on the 18th. In the previous two days, the number of female workers in each factory was very small. Most workers were still waiting to see. In a few factories, there were no workers at all. As of yesterday, the 20th, all factories have been working as usual and the order is good. Female workers have also entered the factories to work. Therefore, the resumption of work has been resolved. However, the issue of improving treatment is still difficult to resolve. The county government has repeatedly summoned representatives of both labor and capital to the county to discuss solutions. The principles were agreed upon the other day, with wages standardized at 4.7 jiao per day. The issue of bonuses will be discussed later. The salaries of factory staff will be the responsibility of each factory. The arrested workers will be interrogated and released after thorough investigation. The county will issue a public notice. However, the capitalists believe that they cannot accept the point of agreeing on a daily wage of 4.7 jiao, and stated that the factory's situation was originally at the end of its rope, barely surviving. The factory can only let it take its course. Therefore, the principles agreed upon by the county government were again invisibly cancelled. Sun Xiangfeng, a member of the county party headquarters, believed that if this matter remained unresolved, the losses to both labor and capital would be heavy. At midnight on the other night, he invited Xue Shouyun, Hua Shaochun, Qian Fenghao, and others in charge of the industry association to make a final mediation. The capitalists stated that if the resumption of work in each factory was good tomorrow (i.e., yesterday, the 20th), then the principle of a standard wage of 4.7 jiao could be accepted. By yesterday morning, most factories had resumed work. Only the workers in Guangchengyuan and Kangda factories in Huangbudun were waiting to see. All parties believed that the issue of wage increases could be resolved satisfactorily. The county government again invited labor and capital to mediate at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 20th). After the industry association formally accepted the principles, the strike should be fully resolved.</p>
<h3>Main Culprit in Cocoon Bank Robbery Case Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Qian Yuanju cocoon bank in Houyangfang in the second district was robbed of 6,532 yuan in cash and foreign currency at 9:00 PM on June 6 this year. The robbers escaped at the time. The situation has been recorded in previous reports. After the case occurred, Zhong Lihe, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, searched everywhere, but there were no clues. On the 13th of this month, the Fourth Branch of the Changshu Public Security Bureau arrested a young man and woman in Gangkou Town, known for their extravagant behavior and suspicious appearance, and seized 1,103 yuan in notes and fractional notes from the Siming Bank, and detained them for investigation. Later, Zhou Ding, the director of the branch, sent detectives to Wuxi to meet with detectives from the local detective team. They learned that the Yuanju cocoon bank in our city had been robbed of a large sum of money, most of which was in Siming Bank notes. They then knew that they were the robbers in the Yuanju cocoon bank robbery case. Detective Gu reported the situation to Yu. Zhou, the director of the branch, severely interrogated them in court. The suspect initially hesitated and denied it. After repeated questioning, he confessed the truth. According to his confession, his name is He Yunding, 22 years old, from Zhuji, Zhejiang. He served as a soldier and admitted that he conspired with others to rob the Yuanju cocoon bank. He also confessed that he called a prostitute, Cao Jinniang, to accompany him at the Jiangsu Hotel in Shanghai. The next day, they went to Yu together and held a wedding ceremony at the Daxin Hotel in Siqian Street, renting a house to live together in Gangkou Town. When the prostitute Cao Jinniang was interrogated, she stated that she knew nothing about the case. Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau of our city, prepared a document yesterday morning and sent personnel to Yu to bring the two suspects, He and Cao, to Wuxi and ordered them to be detained and transferred to the county government for verification.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Road Workers Gather to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Our county plans to build a branch road from Yangjian to the Jiangbian in Fushan, west of the Xihu Road trunk line, named Yangfu Highway, under the plan of the Construction Department. This construction project is contracted by Changhua Company and others, which recruited workers to construct the road. It will soon be completed. However, these road workers often rely on their numbers to be rude and make trouble unreasonably. They previously beat a woman from Gangkou to death. The murderers are all in custody. Unexpectedly, they are now intensifying their efforts. The other day, they gathered hundreds of people and surrounded Liu Changli, the town chief of Fushan, demanding supplies. Otherwise, they would ask to pay off the owed grain. Liu was unable to escape the encirclement and paid off five dan of white rice on their behalf. At the same time, a similar incident occurred at the office of Jiang Bokang, the town chief of Gangkou. They also seized goods from shops without any reason. The town chiefs were afraid of accidents, so they jointly came to the county to ask for instructions. County Magistrate Chen summoned Zhao Xuanzhang, the director of the road project, to the county and asked him to stop it. He also presented a report to the Construction Department for instructions on how to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Purchasing Arsenic to Murder a Deaf-Mute Husband</h3>
<p>There is a widow, Yang Cai, in Wuqiaoxiang, Qibaoliujia, Jiuhu, Wujiaqiao, in the fifth district of our county, who is already 60 years old. She only has one son named Shanxiang, who is in his twenties, and is deaf and mute. He married a wife, Zhu, who is 23 years old. She was adopted as a child bride and only got married last year. Cai herself works as a hired worker outside to supplement the family income. However, her daughter-in-law Zhu was unhappy because she married this deaf-mute husband, so she sought another lover. Ji Shizi, a fellow villager, had a relationship with the woman, and the two were very affectionate. This spring, they planned to separate from the deaf-mute husband and find another match. They also filed a lawsuit in court accusing her aunt of forcing the marriage. After the investigation, the prosecution was dropped. Zhu harbored resentment in her heart after returning home. The other day, she secretly bought arsenic and mixed it into wheat flour and induced her deaf-mute husband to eat it. Coincidentally, her aunt Cai suddenly returned home that day because of something and discovered that her son had symptoms of poisoning. At that time, she invited her neighbor Zhao Xinglong to help with the rescue and reported it to the village chief Li Kanghou and others to investigate the matter. They saw Shanxiang lying on the door, his fingers were blue, his eyes were red, and he was vomiting uneasily. Li and others took the vomited material and sealed it. They immediately arrested the murderer Zhu and sent them to the Fifth District Office in Daqiaozhen for a brief interrogation. On the 18th, they transferred them to the Jiangdu Court. Chief Prosecutor Li opened the court for interrogation and ordered Zhu to be detained pending investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Chen Xiangrong Shot in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Chen Xiangrong, a resident of Baisha Bay in our county, was arrested in connection with the robbery of silk in Shengjialangxia, Jiaxing, and has been detained in the security commander's detention center for five months. The main culprit in the silk robbery, Ru Changming, has already been executed. Chen was implicated by Ru's confession, so he was severely interrogated many times and confessed to the conspiracy. According to Jiaxing News, Chen Xiangrong has been executed by shooting by the Jiaxing District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office. When he was escorted to the execution ground, Chen shouted that he was wronged. According to local people, Chen is a native of the area and does not seem to be the type to traffic in stolen goods, and he is only 19 years old, so he has no courage. This time, he was implicated, which is a warning to those who are not careful in making friends.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Jin District Sugar Factory Decides to Close</h3>
<p>The Jin District Cooperative Sugar Factory has been operating for four years. Last year, it once again purchased machinery and expanded its equipment. Due to poor management, the losses have reached more than 80,000 yuan. After the Construction Department sent personnel to investigate, it originally planned to raise funds to reorganize and manufacture brown sugar factories. Due to financial difficulties, it was decided to shut down and the factory was ordered to close. All the machines will be lent to Yongjia for trial use.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Shaoxing Section Preparations for Construction</h3>
<p>In order to complete the entire line of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Ministry of Railways is actively preparing for the construction of the Hangzhou-Shaoxing section. It has appointed Zhang Haiping as the director of the engineering office to be responsible for preparations. Zhang was summoned to Nanjing by Hangzhou yesterday to ask the Ministry of Railways for instructions on everything and to organize the Hangzhou-Shaoxing Section Engineering Office in Xiaoshan. The section is about 100 kilometers long, and it is divided into three engineering sections to start construction surveys simultaneously. After construction starts on August 1, it is expected to be completed within one year.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Track-Laying Project</h3>
<p>The track-laying project on the Hangzhou-Ningbo section is being carried out in two sections. From Jiangbian in Xiaoshan to Cao'e in Shaoxing, it is under the control of the Ningbo section. The Zhakou section is under the control of the Hangzhou section. Currently, the Jiangbian to Shaoxing section has begun preparations. Track laying will begin on September 1 this year. The Hangzhou section of the project bypasses Baitashan and reaches the Qianjiang Bridge. The earthwork has begun to be filled and is expected to be completed in about a month. The track on both sides will be completed before the Qianjiang Bridge is completed. The Ningbo section also plans to open to traffic first and hold a traffic ceremony after the track is connected over the railway bridge.</p>
<h3>Five Children Drown While Fishing</h3>
<p>Every summer, the lunar new moon tide in the Qiantang River is particularly large. The area near Xiaosibu in Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, is close to the river beach. The tide is larger than in other places. On the night of the 17th of this month, three children from the Feng family and four children from the Zheng family from the local residents went to catch the tidal fish when the tide came. Unexpectedly, there were more fish after the heavy rain that afternoon, but the waves were also larger than last month. Just as they were entering the river to fish, the waves suddenly came, and they were unable to escape to the shore in time. All seven children were swept away by the waves. Two of the children were older and ran to the shore, avoiding drowning. The whereabouts of the other five children were still unknown until the tide receded.</p>
<h3>False Tales of the Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>The Living Conditions of the She People</p>
<p>If you first visit the infant asylums in Jinhua and Lishui counties, you will be equally shocked. It's as if a "land of daughters" truly exists in this world. Otherwise, how is it that little boys are not easily found? If you go to the countryside to inquire, you will find an abundance of information like the curses that "daughters are a losing proposition" and the "valuing sons over daughters" mentality. This will then move you with pity, wishing you could call upon the predecessors and question them: why use so many unreasonable customs to bind and drown the fate of women, to such an extent?</p>
<p>However, in this era of constantly promoting women's rights and singing their praises to the skies, if you truly want to go a step further and practically liberate the rural women who are trampled under these bad customs, then "if the rites are lost, seek them in the wilderness." You only need to consult the She people who live in the mountain corners nearby. Because in their unique society, not only will you not find the phenomenon of "valuing sons over daughters," but you will instead admire the robust and active abilities of women.</p>
<p>The She people of eastern Zhejiang migrated from Fujian and Guangdong. Although the Han people in eastern Zhejiang cannot be said to be native-born, they at least arrived centuries before the She people. Therefore, the Han people also call them "She Guests." Eastern Zhejiang originally had many mountains and few plains. The She people, who truly "came later and surpassed the earlier arrivals," naturally had no choice but to bring their families up the mountains. The mountains are rugged and difficult to cultivate, so they had to do their best and struggle with nature. As a result, they developed the habit of perseverance and the opportunity to maintain the balanced development of abilities between the two sexes. Now, Lishui, Jinyun, Taishun, Xuanping, and other counties, with their towering mountains and steep ridges, have become their world, where they gather their families and cultivate the land to thrive and multiply. Even in the countryside of Yongkang, Lanxi, and Yiwu, their traces are gradually appearing. This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The appearance, customs, and language of the She people are different from those of the Han people. Their clothing and decorations are similar to those of the Han men, but very different for the women. Usually, they are barefoot, wearing shoes with rolled edges, and cloth leggings (commonly known as "wrapped feet"). The agility with which they walk is comparable to that of soldiers. They wear blue cloth skirts around their waists, and their chest fronts are inlaid with very wide white edges, with two red edges added, which look particularly dazzling. Unmarried girls only wear blue cloth scarves on their heads. Married women wear bamboo tube-style hats on their heads, about three inches long, hollow in the middle, covered with red felt, and inlaid with silver edges, and silver pieces are nailed on the front and back, with silver hairpins inserted and beaded strings hung. The entire outfit is worth five or six yuan. The distinction between clan seniority is determined by the height of the bamboo tube (the Lan and Lei surnames are taller, the Zhong and Lou surnames are second, etc.). The hair is combed and coiled on top of the head, with the bamboo tube hat embedded, trembling and attracting attention. Some say that this is a remnant of a conquered people, because that kind of attire is very similar to the victorious nation forcing them to comb their hair in that way, so that they can be grabbed and lifted at any time. But they say that this was bestowed by the emperor in the past.</p>
<p>The problem of living and eating is not much different from that of ordinary farmers in the local area. Well-off families live in tile houses, while poor families mostly live in thatched houses. They mainly eat coarse grains, and only occasionally eat rice during festivals and sacrifices. In addition, although many are inextricably linked with tobacco and alcohol, they fear red pills and drugs like snakes and scorpions. This is not due to the strictness of the law, but because they have never smelled the fragrance of the medium, opium.</p>
<p>Marriage is based on monogamy. Because men and women have equal status and social interaction is relatively open, solving this is not a big problem. People with the same surname who are not within the five degrees of mourning can marry. The ceremony is simple and does not emphasize wealth. When a woman marries, her parents prepare a feast, invite close relatives, and choose female companions with both parents alive to eat the farewell feast with the bride. The bride sits at the feast and must sing a kind of song as if weeping and complaining, to show her reluctance to part. The mother is reluctant to let go, and some cannot help but sob. But because of the jokes of her friends, or because someone makes fun of the groom who is coming to marry her, the bride cannot help but be overjoyed and will laugh through her tears. There is a children's rhyme among the locals: "Mountains in the mountains, bays in the bays, radish flowers bloom into peonies, peony girls are getting married, pomegranate sisters are matchmakers. The matchmaker arrives, good to discuss. The porters arrive, crying for parents. Get on the sedan and cry three times, get off the sedan and worship Guanyin." This is exactly a description of the joy in the eyebrows and laughter in the heart when the beauties of these deep mountains and secluded valleys get married.</p>
<p>When the bride arrives at her husband's house, although there are also things like ancestor worship and banquets, they are all very simple and do not involve extravagance. Three days later, she will take on the family affairs and farm work very readily. When she is about to give birth, even before a month after giving birth, if it happens to be the busy farming season, they still wrap their leggings and go to work. Men, on the other hand, often enjoy a life of leisure and hold the children. Like many Mongol and Tibetan ethnic groups, the model is "men govern inside, women govern outside." However, because transportation is more convenient, and they often go to the city to do business, due to survival competition and assimilation into Han customs, they have gradually changed and become a state of joint labor and joint enjoyment between the two sexes.</p>
<p>Because the ability of women to engage in farming labor is no less than that of men, there is no distinction between valuing or disliking children after marriage. If an old person has no sons but has daughters, they can recruit a son-in-law. If they do not even have a daughter, they will foster one from others, raising her as if she were their own. When she grows up, they will recruit a son-in-law. However, in the organizational structure of their society, women occupy an important position in production and the economy. It is sometimes more difficult to foster a little girl from someone else's family than to foster a little baby. To put it bluntly, because most boys become lazy and good-for-nothing as they grow up. In this deformed state, I cannot find girls from the same clan. Therefore, the infant asylums in the city, which are famous in name only, are where they aim to select and adopt jewel-like girls. And those many little lives in the land of daughters only hope that they will come and be their saviors. Daughters recruit sons-in-law to establish families, change their surnames, and register in the genealogy to have the right to inherit property. If the husband dies young, the widow can remarry freely, and of course the only daughter-in-law can continue to recruit a husband without having to remain chaste unilaterally.</p>
<p>The occupations of the She people are mainly farming, supplemented by raising pigs and playing mahjong. There are very few who engage in business. This is obviously limited by the mountainous environment. In addition, there are those in the city who inherit the occupation of running errands. In the eyes of ordinary people, they are regarded the same as "lazy people" and "fishermen of the Nine Surnames" (descendants of soldiers stationed during the Yuan Dynasty. After the fall of the Yuan Dynasty, these people sought to be slaves to avoid death, and mostly engaged in carrying poles, butchering, matchmaking, and other occupations), called "lowly people" or "people of small surnames." Now that there is ethnic equality, they should of course be regarded as legitimate laborers, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Most of the She people who live in the mountains are kind-hearted, hardworking, and able to endure hardship. They get along well with the natives when they come to the city to do business. The spirit of mutual assistance and unity within the clan is even better than that of the Han people. Unfortunately, their cultural knowledge is low and they are very superstitious. When they get sick, they say that it is a disaster brought down by the gods. When they encounter something happy, they also attribute it to the gift of the gods. Therefore, they do not hesitate to spend a lot of money to invite shamans to pray for blessings and express gratitude. During festivals and ancestor worship, they only use the three sacrificial animals, not cooked food, and hold secret ceremonies that outsiders are not allowed to see, which causes unnecessary suspicion. It is said that the ancestor they worship is a large-headed image of Panhu. This is similar to how some people want to visit mosques and churches in the interior but are not allowed to, and mistakenly spread that they worship such and such strange images inside. These are all equally unconscious and difficult to believe.</p>
<p>However, it is a fact that the She people have not received a proper basic education. During the Qing Dynasty, those with agile minds entered private schools and requested to participate in the imperial examinations. Unfortunately, they ran into a snag with the imperial court. Since the Republic of China, although there has been talk of equal educational opportunities, they are ultimately restricted by customs that are difficult to break. Even if there is no discrimination here, they still have some conception of "being ashamed to associate with them," preferring to hide in private schools, reading old books like the "Three Hundred Character Classic" and the "Thousand Character Classic," unwilling and unable to enter formal schools to study useful science books. If the authorities believe that adjusting the pace of the entire Chinese nation and encouraging the She people to study is a matter of urgency, then of course they can no longer "suddenly put it aside." Moreover, the advantages of the ethnic group's spirit of gender equality and unity can also serve as a stimulant to rescue and correct the bad customs of valuing sons over daughters in the local area.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Provinces and Cities Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday. Yu Rongquan and Five Others Were Publicly Elected as the Presidium. Wang Xiaolai Reported that the Proposals Were Divided into Three Groups for Review.</h3>
<p>In order to develop commerce and improve the organization of merchant groups, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce specially convened representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities to hold a joint meeting. As of the day before yesterday, the registered representatives from various provinces and cities included the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, as well as representatives from Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other provinces and cities. The opening ceremony was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives in Attendance: Zhou Zishi, Liang Rendao, and Wan Zhucun from the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Nanchang City Chamber of Commerce; Tao Yutang and Huang Xiren from Wuhu; Xu Xinggong from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce; Cheng Ganqing, Yu Xiaochuan, and Wang Jingting from the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce; Liu Wenting and Wang Deting from the Qingdao City Chamber of Commerce; Xu Guosen and Liu Yangshan from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce; Luo Huizong from the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce; Gu Huaibing from the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce; Zhu Yaoting from the Henan Chamber of Commerce; Yuan Duanfu from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce; Zi Yuting from the Shandong Chamber of Commerce; Zheng Longwen from Jinan City; Wang Xiaolai, Ge Jiechen, Du Yuesheng, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, and Xu Xiaochu from the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce; Cai Chang and Liang Bingjian from the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce; Chen Xinyan from Nanjing City; Yu Rongquan, Gao Bochang, and Yin Jingshen from Hankou City; Gu Suming from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce; Wang Yungugu from Wuhu; Zhang Shuliang from Shanxi, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: After the meeting began, Wang Xiaolai, a representative of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, reported the purpose of the convocation and the names of the registered representatives from various provinces and cities. Next, five people were publicly elected as the presidium as follows: Yu Rongquan, Yu Xiaochuan, Yuan Duanfu, Cai Chang, and Wang Xiaolai. After the election, the opening address was delivered by Chairman Wang Xiaolai: "Distinguished representatives of the chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities, in response to the invitation from our chamber, you have traveled through mountains and rivers in the height of summer to come to Shanghai to attend this joint meeting. As the host, our chamber extends its unlimited welcome and deep gratitude. Since 1928, there has been no opportunity for formal contact and meetings between commercial groups in Shanghai and representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces. This joint meeting provides an opportunity for a good meeting, no different from old friends reuniting after a long separation. The joy is difficult to express. Although Shanghai bears the false name of being the first commercial port in the country, in recent years it has been affected first by the Shenyang and Shanghai incidents, and then by the export of silver and the depreciation of real estate, causing great panic in the market. By the time the legal tender was implemented and silver gradually stabilized, it was affected by the situation in North China and smuggling, resulting in the blockage of the path for domestic products to be sold in the north. The state of Shanghai's commercial decline in recent years can be said to be the worst in the country. The main purpose of convening this joint meeting is to rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of the chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to jointly seek a solution to save the situation. Because Shanghai is the first line of defense for commerce in the country, if the front line is defeated, it will inevitably spread to the rear, and the harm will only be a matter of degree and time. Distinguished representatives have come to Shanghai despite the summer heat, truly demonstrating the great spirit of sharing weal and woe and being in the same boat. This meeting aims to break the blockage of the path for the sale of domestic products through collective effort. Therefore, we pay the most attention to the issue of the tax system. Secondly, in order to improve commerce, we must first improve the organization of merchants themselves. Although China has had chambers of commerce since the 27th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the system of guilds and associations, which was the predecessor of trade associations, has a history of hundreds of years. To be fair, the organization of merchant groups is earlier than that of other sectors. However, due to the long-standing laissez-faire policy, even after the reorganization of guilds or associations into trade associations in 1918, with clearer powers and more specialized responsibilities, there are still shortcomings of isolation and dispersion, which are not enough to exert their great effectiveness. As the saying goes, 'If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools.' Chambers of commerce and trade associations are the only driving force for promoting commerce. We must first strengthen their organization so that all commercial facilities in the future can respond as easily as the arm is controlled by the body and the finger is controlled by the arm, no longer like the current situation where chambers of commerce and trade associations are divided into two, and trade associations and the same industry are divided into two. In this way, anything that should be developed or reformed can be done immediately and implemented thoroughly. Although our chamber is the host of this joint meeting, we only put forward key proposals and do not seek too many. It is sincere because everyone has their own business and takes time out to come to Shanghai, and time is precious. Rather than being broad and lacking essentials and wasting time, it is better to focus on a few major cases that are easier to handle. I offer this frankness and ask for your guidance." Next, Secretary Director Yan Esheng reported on the letters and telegrams of request for leave from representatives, and that as of today, a total of seventeen proposals have been received, divided into three groups: those related to commercial law, those related to commodities, and those related to commerce.</p>
<p>Group Review: After the report, members of the proposal review committee were appointed, still divided into three groups: Commercial Law Group, Director Zhu Yaoting, Deputy Director Luo Qinghua, members Yin Jingshen, Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Jingting, Xu Guosen, Xu Xinggong, Zhang Shuliang, Liu Wenting, Wang Deting, Chen Xinyan, Tao Yutang, and Ke Ganchen; Commodity Group, Director Wan Zhucun, Deputy Director Ge Jiechen, members Luo Huizong, Liu Yangshan, Gao Bochang, Yuan Duanfu, Zhou Zishi, Liang Rendao, Wang Yungugu, Huang Xiren, Jin Runxiang, and Xu Xiaochu; Commercial Group, Director Zi Yuting, Deputy Director Xu Ji, members Jin Rongqiao, Wang Xiaolai, Zheng Longwen, Cheng Ganqing, Cai Chang, Liang Jingxuan, Jia Shaowu, Du Yuesheng, and Gu Suming. Next, representatives from various provinces and cities, such as Xu Xinggong and Chen Xinyan, gave speeches. The meeting adjourned for a photo.</p>
<p>Second General Assembly: At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the three groups of commercial law, commodities, and commerce were convened by the directors Zhu Yaoting, Wan Zhucun, and Zi Yuting respectively, and the members of each group reviewed them at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the review reports have been compiled. It was not completed until 6:00 p.m. At 7:00 p.m., the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for the representatives of various provinces and cities, which ended at about 9:00 p.m. The second general assembly will be held at the chamber at 9:00 a.m. today to discuss the review reports of each group. At 8:00 p.m., the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce representative Wang Xiaolai and others will host a banquet for the representatives of various provinces and cities at the International Hotel on Jingan Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Views on the Resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi Issue</h3>
<p>The Lessons It Gives Us Are Four. Central News Agency reports: The Central News Agency reporter learned that the news of Chen Jitang's resignation and arrival in Hong Kong has now been confirmed. He specially visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng to ask about his feelings on the resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi issue. Mayor Wu told him: "In this Guangdong-Guangxi incident, the central government has made painstaking efforts to maintain the national laws and disciplines, always adhering to the spirit of leniency and generosity of the Premier, and dealing with it peacefully. Its hard work in taking into account unity, peace, discipline, and prosperity should be seen by the people of the country. China has many difficulties, with internal and external pressures. Since we are unfortunate enough to encounter this change, we should learn valuable lessons from this painful incident in order to prevent future mistakes. Then, if we do not forget the past, we can learn from it, and the future of the country is not without opportunities for change. As far as my personal views are concerned, the lessons that the Guangdong-Guangxi incident gives us are four: The resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi issue, although due to the appropriate handling by the central government, also benefited from the unanimous condemnation of public opinion throughout the country. Moreover, the people's ability to judge national affairs has improved compared to the past. Those who borrow names to pursue private interests are not enough to confuse people's hearts. This incident is enough to serve as a warning to those who act rashly and advocate militarism. The only prerequisite for saving the country and resisting foreign aggression is unity, the unification of political and military orders. This is an undeniable historical lesson. Since the Republic of China, there have been many sources of political orders, and the political orders have been inconsistent. The country has had many difficulties, and it has been unable to concentrate its national strength to deal with the changes in the world, which is really painful. From now on, the central government's political orders can be absolutely unified. This is not only a new page in the political history since the Republic of China, but also a good sign of a turning point in the country's destiny. I deeply hope that the people of the country will work hard to maintain it."</p>

<p>Hu Wencan</p>
<p>With the pacification of the situation in Guangdong, the Central Committee members who stayed in Guangdong and came north to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, except for Huang Linshu, Deng Qingyang, etc., who have returned south one after another, it is now learned that Mr. Hu Wencan also took the Dollar Steamship Company's President Lincoln on the 18th, returning south from Shanghai to Hong Kong first to meet with Mr. Xiao Focheng to discuss everything, and then return to Guangdong. He will soon return north again to report the situation in Guangdong Province after the incident to the central government.</p>
<p>Wang Shouting</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Wang Shouting, Commander of the Naval Training Squadron, has been ordered to come to Shanghai. He arrived at Songjiang on the Hai Rong cruiser yesterday morning. After the ship dropped anchor, Mr. Wang landed at Songjiang and took a car to Shanghai. In the afternoon, he went to the Gaoyangmiao Headquarters to read official documents.

Mr. Bogomolov does not plan to stay in Shanghai for too long because of the hot weather in Shanghai, and plans to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today or tomorrow, visit Foreign Minister Zhang, and then change trains to go north to Beiping and then to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. He will return south after the weather cools down in the autumn.</p>
<h3>The Gauze Exchange Stopped New Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the occurrence of dangers, the Chinese Gauze Exchange has stopped all new cotton transactions for July and August since yesterday, and an additional three yuan per picul will be charged in addition to the special margin cash. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Transactions Stopped: Because the price of cotton yarn and cloth has been fluctuating recently, the Exchange notified the Brokers Association yesterday that, in accordance with Article 357, Item 13 of the Business Rules, all new cotton transactions for July and August will be suspended except for existing old customers in order to prevent dangers.</p>
<p>Additional Cash Collection: Yesterday, the Brokers Association and merchants in the market were also notified that each broker will collect an additional three yuan per picul for new cotton transactions for July and August (a total of nine yuan for July and six yuan for August) in addition to the special margin cash that has been disclosed. The two deposit accounts will be collected as usual, and the principal margin will be collected as usual.</p>
<h3>The Gold Industry Handling Fee Has Been Negotiated and Will Open as Usual This Morning. One Dime Per Bar, Daily Transactions Will Be Reduced by Half. The Brokers Association Is Scheduled to Hold a Meeting Today to Report.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Exchange, in view of the sharp decline in transactions, decided through a meeting of directors to change the handling fee paid by brokers to the exchange to one dime in national currency per bar of marked gold from July 16. In addition to the brokerage incentive of 2.5 cents in national currency, the exchange actually received a handling fee of 7.5 cents in national currency. After negotiating with Zhan Liansheng, chairman of the Brokers Association, it was changed to be implemented yesterday and announced to the public. However, the brokers requested the exchange to make changes, so the opening at 9:00 a.m. yesterday failed. At 2:00 p.m., Xu Busheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Exchange, held a joint meeting with Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Brokers Association, and others to discuss the solution. It was agreed that the opening would resume as usual from the 21st. The handling fee will be one dime per bar, the brokerage incentive will be 2.5 cents, and the daily transactions will be reduced by half, that is, 5 cents per bar, and the brokerage incentive will be 1.25 cents. The Brokers Association is scheduled to hold a brokers meeting at its headquarters on North Wuxi Road at 2:00 p.m. today to report on the progress. According to a reporter from the New Sound Society, in accordance with the amended Article 48, Paragraph 2 of Chapter 9 of the Business Rules, "The amount of commission and handling fee shall be determined by the Board of Directors within the scope of four dimes in national currency per bar of marked gold. The broker shall receive 75% as commission, and the exchange shall receive 25% as handling fee." If one dime is collected, although it is two-thirds higher than before, the sharp decline in transactions is very different from before, and it is difficult to maintain with one dime in handling fee.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Will Send Personnel to the South to Negotiate the Reorganization of the Guangdong Monetary System, Determine Principles, and Study Steps. Tang Hai'an Stayed in Hong Kong and Did Not Return to Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the issue of the central government reorganizing the Guangdong monetary system, according to a reporter's inquiry in the financial community on the morning of the 20th, in order to unify the national monetary system, the central government has decided to change the Guangdong currency to the silver dollar system. It has repeatedly sent personnel to the south to negotiate with the Guangdong authorities on the implementation methods, but Chen Jitang did not cooperate, and it has not been completed. With the failure of the Guangdong-Guangxi incident this time, Chen has left Guangdong and fled. In order to complete the reorganization of the Guangdong monetary system as soon as possible, the financial authorities have decided to take advantage of the Guangdong military and political reforms and send personnel to Guangdong to negotiate with the Guangdong financial authorities and financial community on the implementation methods. The candidates will be Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Bei Songsun, Manager of the Bank of China. According to Mr. Bei, the date of going south has not yet been decided. How to reorganize the Guangdong monetary system will of course be based on the principle of not harming the social economy and people's livelihood. As for the implementation steps, they are still under detailed study. Reports said that Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, who was ordered to go to Guangdong to negotiate the reorganization of the Guangdong monetary system, has already returned to Shanghai. According to Tang's residence in this city, Mr. Tang is still in Hong Kong, and it has not been decided when he will go north.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Foundation Bureau Funding: Banks Can Immediately Determine Allocations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with Shanghai's financial circles, established the Agricultural Foundation Bureau. After deliberations on the organizational outline and fundraising methods, presided over by Minister of Industry and Commerce Wu Dingchang and financial representatives, the bureau's fixed capital was set at sixty million yuan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce committed to underwriting half of this amount, to be paid in five years, with six million yuan to be allocated this year. The decision of whether to request appropriation from the Ministry of Finance or for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to raise the funds independently will be made within days. The financial sector's commitment to underwrite the other half was decided in principle at a meeting last Saturday. Of the six million yuan to be paid this year, commercial banks will underwrite five million yuan, proportionally based on one percent of their total savings deposits. The remaining one million yuan will be determined by the Agricultural Bank itself. Currently, banks are calculating their underwriting amounts based on their savings deposits. The Bank of China is expected to underwrite approximately 800,000 yuan, the Chinese Farmers Bank approximately 600,000 yuan, and the Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank combined 500,000 yuan. Other banks are expected to underwrite amounts between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan. Once underwriting is completed within this week, a meeting will be held to report on the progress, elect directors to be reported to the Ministry, and then formally establish the bureau. It is rumored that Qian Xinzhi is favored by all parties for the position of president, but the president will ultimately be elected through mutual election within the board of directors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a New News Agency reporter's investigation, Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank have already decided to undertake slightly less than one-tenth of the total amount of thirty million yuan, specifically two and a half million yuan, with each bank underwritiing 1.25 million yuan, to be paid in five years. Other banks, including the Bank of Communications, have also determined approximate amounts. A second joint meeting is scheduled for this week, during which individual reports will be presented and decisions made. At that time, twelve merchant shareholder directors will be mutually elected and reported to the Ministry of Industry for formal establishment at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mill Association: Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Relief for the Cotton Industry; Japanese Expansion of Power in China Endangers Chinese Merchants; Representatives to Petition the Central Government for Assistance</h3>
<p>China's cotton industry is currently suffering from the impact of smuggling and large-scale dumping by Japanese mills, its situation worsening daily and becoming unsustainable. Japanese merchants are seizing the opportunity to invest heavily and carry out acquisitions, determined to use Tianjin as a center to actively increase the number of spindles and expand cotton planting areas, with the aim of controlling the entire Chinese industry. Therefore, the future of China's cotton industry has become precarious. The National Cotton Industry Association will convene a regular joint meeting to discuss rescue measures. The following is an investigation into various situations:</p>
<p>Japanese Investment: Acquiring Chinese Factories</p>
<p>After the Tianjin Yuyuan Cotton Mill was sold to the Japanese Kanebo Company in May of this year, it is currently undergoing machinery modifications and being renamed Yufeng Branch No. 2 (Branch No. 1 is in Shanghai). The original 70,000 spindles will be expanded to 100,000. In addition, land has been purchased in nearby Xiaoliuzhuang to construct Branch No. 3, which can also accommodate 70,000 spindles and 1,000 looms, with construction scheduled to begin in the spring of next year. The plan is to transform Xiaoliuzhuang into an industrial area inhabited by Japanese in China within three years. Furthermore, the Toyo Textile Company is also planning to establish a new cotton mill in Special District No. 4, initially installing 50,000 spindles and then expanding, aiming to increase to 100,000 spindles within two years. Secondly, after the Yuda Cotton Mill was managed by the Japanese Textile Company, the original 20,000 spindles have now been expanded to 40,000. In addition, the Baocheng Cotton Mill, also unable to continue operations, was auctioned off by creditors to the Yuda Cotton Mill for 175,000 yuan on the 17th of this month and is currently undergoing modifications to increase spindles. Moreover, the Yuda Cotton Mill, after being acquired by Japanese merchants in early July, was renamed Gongda Branch No. 6. In addition to the original 70,000 spindles, there are plans to expand to 150,000 spindles, and in addition to spinning fine yarn, plans are also being made to weave cloth independently. According to the recent situation, all Chinese-owned cotton mills in Tianjin will be acquired by Japanese merchants one by one, and in three years, they will control the entire Chinese cotton industry, it is said.</p>
<p>Three More Factories: Continuing Acquisitions</p>
<p>In addition to the Yuyuan, Baocheng, and Yuda cotton mills, which have already been acquired by the Japanese, the Huaxin Cotton Mill is also currently being acquired by the Japanese Xingzhong Company, Okura Company, Toyo Textile Company, and Kanebo Company. Secondly, the Beiyang Hengyuan cotton mills, operated by the Chengfu Trust Company, are also unable to compete with Japanese merchants and have been holding meetings for days to discuss the matter. As a result, the decision was made to sell the mills to Japanese operators, and a deal will be concluded soon. According to the Japanese cotton industry, the Shanghai Cotton Mill Association sent a special telegram to Tianjin for inquiry, and the reply stated, "The report is untrue and there is no such thing." Currently, in addition to actively acquiring all Chinese-owned cotton mills in Tianjin, Japanese merchants are also paying attention to Chinese-owned cotton mills in Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Qingdao, and other places, planning to carry out acquisitions. Therefore, the Chinese-owned cotton mills in North China are facing this severe threat and have become precarious. Their future is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>Establishing Branches Everywhere: Dumping at Low Prices</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned factories becoming the foundation for Japanese operations, plans are being made to monopolize the entire Chinese cotton industry. Therefore, on the one hand, the focus is on fine yarn that China cannot spin, and on the other hand, preferential treatment is requested from the Chinese authorities for transportation methods. Business taxes and other levies are also not paid regularly. In order to control the sales of all Chinese cotton, branches have already been established in the Yangtze River area and various ports in Wuhu to sell cotton at low prices. Once the factories acquired in Tianjin are fully renovated and production begins, Japanese merchants will establish branches in South China, Central China, and important towns to sell cotton. Because they do not pay various taxes and levies, it is difficult for Chinese cotton to compete. Their ambition is evident.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Germany for Investigation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that it will be difficult to remedy the situation of Japanese factories being established in China and Japanese cotton being dumped without a comprehensive plan. In order to understand the situation of the textile industry abroad and learn from it, Yu Jianxun has been sent to Germany for investigation. Yu arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month to complete the procedures for going abroad and is scheduled to take the Dutch mail steamer Potsdam to Germany tomorrow (the 22nd), specializing in investigating textiles and rayon, with a term of six months.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Association Plans Rescue Measures</p>
<p>The National Chinese Cotton Mill Association believes that the sales channels for Chinese cotton have become critical and that the Chinese merchants in Tianjin have also been invested in and acquired by Japanese merchants. The entire cotton industry has become precarious. If there is no concrete and comprehensive plan, it will be difficult to reverse this dangerous situation. Therefore, the council of the association is currently gathering to formulate a proposal. Afterwards, a general meeting of members will be convened to notify Chinese cotton mills in various places to send representatives to Shanghai to discuss solutions. Representatives will then be sent to the capital to petition various ministries and departments, requesting strong assistance to maintain the industry.</p>
<p>Xu Fu's Rectification: Shanghai's Fiscal Plan</p>
<p>Approximately Divided into Seven Major Items</p>
<p>This city was originally the commercial center of the entire country, attracting attention from both Chinese and foreigners. However, since the incident, revenue has sharply decreased, while expenditures have conversely increased. Therefore, in recent years, finance has been extremely difficult. Yesterday, our reporter met with Mr. Hu Yizang, a design committee member of the Finance Bureau who recently returned from Japan after studying municipal administration. He discussed the Shanghai's fiscal rectification plan of Director Xu as follows: Since taking office, Director Xu of our bureau has been working tirelessly and has completely cleared up the debts of his predecessor in less than three months. At present, Director Xu is working to establish fiscal policy and build a model municipal finance. The plans being implemented are approximately divided into seven areas, namely: rectifying housing taxes, clearing old land tax arrears, increasing public property income, establishing an accounting system, implementing budgets, eliminating various tax and levy malpractices, and revitalizing the spirit of doing things. Among them, the land tax arrears amount to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and clearing up is currently being planned. There are also improved methods for collecting housing taxes. Regarding public property, after dividing the county and city areas, its nature is being studied and utilized separately. Other things like accounting system operating rules, and other overall plans, have been extensively studied and revamped by Secretary Wu Xiu, Wu Qiankui, Section Chief Chen Jun, Shi Lei, Xia Mao and other gentlemen, removing each of the past malpractices. On the one hand, experts have also been dispatched to plan for land consolidation, with the overall goal of making Shanghai's municipal finance and land administration a model for the entire country, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shantytown Residents in Eastern and Western Shanghai Petition; United Association to Proceed Today; Sends Letters to Various Sectors Outlining the Situation</h3>
<p>Shantytown residents in the eastern and western districts of Shanghai, in order to negotiate the demolition order issued by the Municipal Council, formed the Shanghai Shantytown United Association and decided to petition various parties today. Yesterday, letters were sent to various sectors outlining the situation. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Shanghai Appeals</p>
<p>The letter from the shantytown residents of the Eastern District, a document appealing to all sectors, states: "Respectfully, when we, the shantytown residents of the Eastern District, read the four conditions reported on the 16th, we were all moved to tears of joy. However, these four conditions do not cause any harm to the Municipal Council, and we shantytown residents can only bear the pain and accept them without demolition. Therefore, our representatives have followed the above conditions and started to compile a chain guarantee, which can be completed in a few days. When it is completed, it will be announced and we will jointly take responsibility to supplement the insufficiencies of the Municipal Council. Afterwards, if there are any obstructions to construction or transportation, we will relocate on our own and will not be allowed to seek land to rebuild. Only in this way will there be no increase and a gradual decrease. This should be known to all sectors. Today's report (17th) quoted a person in charge of the Municipal Council as saying, 'There is no such proposal.' We, the shantytown residents of the Eastern District, were shocked. The above conditions are not unreasonable, and forcing execution under the pretext of the appearance of the city is not what those with social awareness would do. Moreover, although class distinctions in cities of various countries tend towards equality, it is inevitable that there will be a wide gap between rich and poor. How can China, which lags behind in production, maintain perfection? Therefore, we earnestly request your association to uphold reason and fulfill the conditions, so that industry and commerce can be stabilized and people's livelihoods can be hoped for. At present, there is a real need to preserve shantytowns in the midst of the dilapidated state. According to the recent survey of shantytowns, 30 to 40 percent are laborers of the Municipal Council, 10 to 20 percent are factory workers, and 40 to 50 percent are unemployed, crying for food. Who has pity on the desolation? We have always admired your association as a shield for the citizens and are sure that you can relieve our suffering and prevent us from becoming displaced. Otherwise, improving the appearance of the city will harm the appearance of the city, and planning for security will harm security, which is of no benefit. The harm will be immediately apparent. If we can stop at the edge of the cliff, withdraw the order, and fulfill the conditions, then we, the shantytown residents, will be immensely grateful and await orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Western Shanghai Begs for Assistance</p>
<p>The shantytown residents of the Western District also sent letters to various sectors yesterday begging for assistance. The original text states: "In order to present our grievances and request assistance to relieve the people's suffering and comfort the frightened masses, we are the shantytown residents of the Western District, numbering more than eighteen small areas, with more than a thousand shantytown families. We have been repeatedly eliminated by the Public Concession Municipal Council, which recognized 318 of our families as legal residences and issued us house numbers. Suddenly, on June 26th and 27th of this year, staff were dispatched one after another to take away 13 house numbers on Yichang Road, 15 on Moqian Mountain Road, 3 on Haifang Road, and 15 on New Tokyo Road, totaling 46 house numbers. It is thought that the locations of the house numbers taken back are indeed remote, not at the intersection of important routes, and do not hinder the appearance of the city. Moreover, they are places where Chinese people rent from Chinese people, and the grass sheds built after paying land rent every year have been permitted by the landlords and have never been dangerous. Suddenly, they were trampled upon and we were given until the 26th of this month to demolish and relocate. Thinking of our 300-plus families, with more than 3,000 mouths to feed, with nowhere to live, women and children were extremely frightened, as if living in boiling water, and wept all day long. Fortunately, we read in the third page of the News Report of the 16th of this month (Thursday) that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, out of compassion, proposed four methods for the shantytown residents of the Eastern District to mediate with the Municipal Council, which have been approved by the authorities. However, our 318 families also belong to the Special Zone and earnestly request assistance to persuade the Municipal Council to treat us equally, to issue the house numbers that were taken back to the households, so as to calm the frightened masses. We are immensely grateful and await orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Today's Petition</p>
<p>Since the shantytown residents of the two districts formed the Shantytown United Association, they are scheduled to petition the Municipal Council Taxpayers' Association and the Citizens' Association today. Their goals are: 1. To request the Municipal Council to build public housing; 2. If the Municipal Council builds roads and landlords build houses, permission should be granted for relocation; 3. To guarantee that the number of shantytowns will not increase in the future. The representatives to petition have already been designated as Hu Yumen, Xu Yiqun, Tian Ruishan, Sun Weijin, Jiang Yibo, Wang Chengguang, Xu Xipeng, Liu Jinshan, Xu Jingqing, Deng Xiuzheng, Wang Qitai, Sun Hongkui, Xu Xiyuan, Yin Yifu, Sun Xudan, Zhang Wenyun, Liu Wuchen, Tang Anping, Gu Xuebo, Liu Xuezhuo, Wang Jiayu, Wang Daomeng, Guo Bingzhi, Jiang Shanchang, Ji Yunshan, Jia Zidong, Zhang Ziying, Dong Maoxiang, and Ye Shuting, a total of twenty-nine people.</p>
<h3>City Education Association Telegraphs Request for Li Bai to Withdraw Troops Back to Guangxi</h3>
<p>A Shanghai News Agency report states that the City Education Association telegraphed: "Director Li Delin and Deputy Director Bai Jiansheng of Guangxi, Your Excellencies, since the troops of the Two Guang Provinces have advanced into neighboring provinces, the situation is serious and the people of the entire nation are heartbroken. We have previously telegraphed requesting you to stop at the edge of the cliff, and we hope that you will consider it. Now, the generals in Guangdong, unable to bear the disintegration, have all returned to allegiance, which shows that revolutionary soldiers are able to deeply understand justice. Hearing this from afar, we are deeply impressed. Commissioner Chen Jitang has also recently left Guangdong to go to Hong Kong and return power to the central government. Now, according to telegrams, the Guangxi troops entering Guangdong not only have not retreated, but have even sent all their forces into Guangdong. The intention behind this is difficult to fathom. As for the major plan to save the country, it has already been decided by the full session, and the two of you have been appointed as national defense committee members and the pacification directors of Guangxi Province. You should each fulfill your duties and quickly withdraw the troops entering Guangdong, and unite with the generals in Guangdong to obey the orders of the central government, complete national unification, and gather national strength to resist foreign aggression."</p>
<h3>National Federation of Machine Workers Sends Representatives to Petition in the Capital, Presenting the Guangdong Authorities' Oppression of the People's Movement</h3>
<p>Han Wenhui and Li Huiru, representatives of the Guangzhou China National Federation of Machine Workers Rescue Association, arrived in Beijing yesterday from Hong Kong and immediately went to the Mass Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters to petition. They were received by Xu Xiaoyan, the chief secretary of the department. Representatives Han presented a petition and reported the circumstances of the illegal seizure of the association by the Southwest authorities, hoping that the central government would find a way to guide the association to be presided over by the association's good workers, so as to avoid the suspension of association affairs. Mr. Xu promised to review the original submission in detail and submit it to the Central Standing Committee for review and instruction. The representatives were satisfied and left. According to Han and Li, the association was established in the sixth year of the Republic of China, and the construction of the association was entirely funded by pure machine workers in Nanyang, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. They assisted the government in participating in the revolutionary work and have a long history, which has long been understood by the society and the people. Unfortunately, in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Guangdong authorities forcibly seized the association and illegally dispatched reorganization committee members, and convened a fake representative conference to achieve their own ends. During the recent changes in the Two Guang Provinces, Chen Jitang bought hundreds of people and planned to come to Beijing to petition and engage in sabotage. The fake committee also sent many people masquerading as worker representatives to participate. Pure workers in various places were indignant that the fake reorganization committee attempted to come to Beijing under false pretenses to confuse the public. In addition to issuing a declaration to deny it (see Hong Kong newspapers of July 4), they specially sent themselves to Beijing to present the truth to the central government, asking the central government to relieve the suffering of the workers and find a way to hand over the association to the good workers of the association to preside over association affairs.</p>
<h3>All Circles' Anti-Smuggling Association Actively Promotes Work; Sends Letters to Yu and Wang Urging a Quick Return to Shanghai; Visits Finance Minister Kong to Seek Guidance</h3>
<p>Various circles in this city, in view of the rampant smuggling, which affects customs duties and hinders the promotion of domestic goods, held a joint conference of public bodies and decided to establish the All Circles' Anti-Smuggling Association. After electing Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and 35 others as executive committee members, the executive committee members elected Yu Qiaqing, Wang Jiean, Cao Zhigong, Qu Zhenhua, Lu Muqin, and five other committee members as representatives in order to assist the government in actively preventing smuggling. They were originally scheduled to go to the Central Bank at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi for instructions in order to follow them. However, because Committee Member Yu Qiaqing was still staying in Putuo and Committee Member Wang Jiean went to Suzhou for business, they were unable to go together. It is now learned that the association has sent letters to the two committee members, Yu and Wang, urging them to return quickly. As soon as Yu and Wang return to Shanghai, they will go to visit Finance Minister Kong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: Reduced Freight Charges</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has submitted a report to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth produced by Shanghai's various dyeing and weaving factories may, based on the certification issued by the Shanghai Municipal Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and the transportation certificate issued by the unified tax authorities, have freight charges calculated at 20% off the current general freight rate or special price. A trial period of one year has been tentatively set, starting on August 1.</p>
<p>Police Officer's Murder Case</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Workers Union Sends Letter to Municipal Public Security Bureau to Arrest the Murderer; Sets a One-Week Deadline to Arrest and Execute the Murderer; Severely Punish Negligent Senior Police Officers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to the submission of Zhang Baoquan, the son of the late member of our union, Zhang Longhai, 'My late father, Zhang Longhai, was a postman in the Central District Post Office. He was honest and diligent in his service. He lived in a bungalow at No. 131 Hetan West Road, Jiangwan, for three years. On the evening of the 15th of this month, at about 8 p.m., Yang Chunyi (also known as Chunyi), who is currently a police officer, suddenly came to my father's residence, lingered for a moment, and then left immediately. About an hour later, he returned to my father's residence and broke in through the front door. He took out a Mauser pistol and shot at my father. The bullet hit a vital part, and my father died immediately. After the murderer Yang Chunyi shot my father, he also shot my father's mistress, Shen Cuie (27 years old), and her sister, Sifang (also known as Xiaomei, 18 years old). Shen Cuie died on the spot, and Shen Sifang was also seriously injured. At the time, the murderer Yang Chunyi was wearing a police uniform. After the incident, he lingered for a while. The Jiangwan police received the report but did not pursue him urgently, allowing the murderer to escape leisurely. Yang Chunyi, as a police officer, used public weapons to kill people, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, I specially request your association to provide impartial assistance and send a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, setting a deadline to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.' At the same time, our union's 26th special group (Central District Post Office) also submitted the same situation. Our union has also sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the situation is true. For the time being, regardless of the motive for Yang Chunyi's shooting of Zhang Longhai and his mistress, legally speaking, Yang Chunyi, as a police officer, has the responsibility to maintain local order and protect the people. Now he is using public weapons as a tool for private murder, maintaining local order is precisely disrupting local order, protecting the people is precisely harming the people. Where is the discipline of the police? Where is the law of the country? The responsible senior officers are to blame. And the Jiangwan Police Station did not pursue the murderer urgently afterwards, causing the murderer to escape leisurely, which is also difficult to deny its negligence. According to the submission, we hereby request you to urgently order the arrest of the murderer, ensuring that he is arrested and executed within one week, and severely punish negligent senior police officers in order to uphold the law of the country and maintain police discipline. This is what we hope for. We hereby submit this to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and hope to receive a reply."</p>

<h3>Missing Japanese National Found: Ito Yoshiro Has Been Admitted to Fumin Hospital; Recognized by a Waiter from the Hanaya Restaurant</h3>
<p>Ito Yoshiro, a 20-year-old Japanese national working at the Hibino Yoko store on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession, left his residence at about 9 p.m. on the 17th of this month, claiming to be going to Wusong Road to buy Western-style shirts and shirts, carrying 20 yuan in cash. However, he never returned. Afterwards, his family reported the incident to the Japanese consulate, which informed all municipal police agencies and requested an investigation. Details have also been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Ito has been found and sent to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. He was discovered by a waiter at the Hanaya restaurant opened by the Japanese on Zha Pu Road. At about 10 p.m. the day before yesterday, a young Japanese man came to the Hanaya restaurant, bought a cup of coffee, paid, and left. However, he returned shortly afterwards and asked the waiter to prepare dinner for him. At that time, the waiter saw that he was confused and his words were vague, and he was very surprised. Observing his expression, he recognized him and immediately telegraphed the Japanese consulate. The police station assigned police officers to identify him, and it was indeed correct. However, because he was confused, he could not speak. A rescue ambulance was urgently summoned to take him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After examination, it was determined that he had taken poison. As of last night, he had slightly regained consciousness, but why he fled and suddenly took poison has not been announced.</p>
<h3>Beer Manufacturing Expert Zhu Mei Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Meijun, a brewing chemistry engineer who studied in Belgium, returned to Shanghai at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. Zhu is from Sichuan. In 1932, he went to France. When he was in China, he saw that people in all walks of life used shochu as a beverage, which was very harmful to their health. Therefore, he thought of something to replace this beverage. The only thing that could replace it was beer. However, beer manufacturing in China was very rudimentary, and most of the beer on the market was foreign. Therefore, Zhu went to France to study beer manufacturing. Two years later, he transferred to the Belgian National Institute of Industrial Fermentation and Manufacturing, which is the only school in Europe specializing in training beer manufacturing talents. After Zhu graduated, he was introduced by Count Van Bock to intern at the Schaerbeek Royal Brewery for six months. His knowledge and experience are extremely rich. Mr. Mi is the first Chinese person to succeed in studying in Europe. This time, when he returns to China, he will begin to contact various parties in Beijing and Shanghai to raise capital to open a large-scale brewery, so as to reduce the value, suit the purchasing power of the general public, and take regaining profit rights as the greatest goal.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Direction: Heading North-Northwest</h3>
<p>Regarding the two hurricanes discovered in the South Pacific, at 6 a.m. on the 20th, according to the Observatory's report, one of the hurricanes, lingering around the coast of Annam, seems to have disappeared. The other hurricane, blowing, has changed to north-northwest and has now blown to the sea surface at 20 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude. The hurricane center is 120 nautical miles. The wind's behavior is unclear. It is still far from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The High Tides the Day Before Yesterday Did Not Exceed Predictions; There Will Be a Spring Tide Next Month; The Municipal Council Begins to Fill in Low-Lying Roads; Godowns and Warehouses Are Equipped with Defenses</p>
<p>The Huangpu River is experiencing high tides due to the autumn floods. Fortunately, there has been no wind or rain, and the tides have not exceeded predictions. However, there will be a spring tide next month, and it is feared that it will overflow the banks. The Municipal Council has begun to build up low-lying roads, and godowns and warehouses along the river are also preparing flood control works. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Previous and Yesterday's High Tides Did Not Exceed Predictions; Large Tide Expected Next Month; Public Works Department Begins Raising Low-Lying Roads; Warehouses and Storage Facilities All Constructed with Defensive Works</h3>
<p>Because the Huangpu River is experiencing the autumn flood season, high tides have occurred frequently. The high tides of the past few days fortunately did not coincide with wind and rain, and did not exceed predictions. However, there is a large tide expected next month, and there is concern that it will overflow the banks. The Public Works Department has already begun raising low-lying roads, and warehouses and storage facilities along the river are also preparing flood prevention works. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Previous and Yesterday's High Tides Did Not Exceed Predictions</p>
<p>The Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau predicted continuous high tides starting from the 19th. On the mornings of the previous and yesterday, because there was no wind or rain, the recorded levels did not exceed predictions. The water levels were only slightly above 11 feet. However, the high tide at 1:47 AM this morning reached 12 feet and 5 inches, less than 1 foot from the height of the Bund embankment of 13 feet. If it does not exceed the predicted water level, low-lying roads will inevitably still be flooded.</p>
<p>Next Month's Large Tide Is Likely to Overflow the Banks</p>
<p>The Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau has also completed measurements for next month's high tides. The highest tides are predicted to occur on August 18th and 19th. The predicted level for the high tide at 0:18 AM on the 18th is 12 feet and 5.4 inches (only 4.6 inches from the Bund embankment). The predicted level for the high tide at 0:51 AM on the 19th is 12 feet and 8 inches (only 2 inches from the Bund embankment). Not only is there a risk of the tide coming ashore if it coincides with wind and rain, but even in calm weather, an embankment less than 13 feet high could be breached, which deserves attention.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Raises Low-Lying Roads</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau, in view of the arrival of the autumn flood season and the rising high tides of the Huangpu River, has begun raising low-lying roads. Work has already begun on a section of Nanjing Road at the intersection of Zhejiang Road, on the side of Wing On Company, raising the road surface by a specified 2 feet. At the same time, a section of Jiujiang Road from Yinghua Street in the west to Hubei Road in the east is also being raised. There are many other low-lying road surfaces that are also planned to be raised in sequence.</p>
<p>Warehouses and Storage Facilities All Undertake Defenses</p>
<p>As for the riverside warehouses of various banks and the storage facilities of shipping companies, since the year before last, flood prevention works have been constructed separately, raising the foundations of warehouses and storage facilities by 3 to 5 feet to prevent high tide incursions. Currently, various warehouses and storage facilities have been repairing these flood prevention works to ensure safety. At the same time, various shipping companies will also jointly issue notices to cargo owners to take delivery of stored goods, otherwise, the cargo owners will be responsible for any losses due to tidal immersion.</p>
<h3>Xu Qizhong Bankruptcy Case: Collusive Plan, Sham Resolution; Those Under 300 Yuan to Be Repaid 40% by Family; Remainder to Be Distributed Proportionately from Auction Proceeds</h3>
<p>The Xu Qizhong scandal bankruptcy case was reconvened yesterday morning at 10 AM by the First Special Court on the third floor of the China General Banking Corporation on Nanjing Road for the third creditors' meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present</p>
<p>The creditors present yesterday included: Ying Cizhen of the Wendi Brothel; Zhou Rongtang of the Yiyuan Furniture Company; Zou Arong of the Zou Juxing Clothing Shop; Zhang Xingchang of the Wang Shunchang Furniture Store; Yu Songxiang of the Xintong Motor Company; Wang Yuanchen of the Quji; Zhao Congyan of the Li Han Car Company; and Shen Liang, Hu, and others, totaling ten households, with claims amounting to 25,033.97 yuan. The debtor, Xu Qizhong, also attended with his attorney, Yu Zhongluo.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The presiding committee was composed of Zhao Guangju, a judge from the First Special Court, and Yu Sifang, a certified public accountant serving as the bankruptcy administrator. Judge Zhao first reported that the amount of claims present at today's meeting did not reach three-quarters of the total registered and unregistered claims, and therefore a settlement plan could not be decided. Next, CPA Wang Sifang reported on (1) the process of auctioning off the assets turned over by Xu Qizhong, (2) the remaining items to be auctioned off, including two Public Works Department car permits, which had been reclaimed by the Public Works Department, (3) the creditor Ying Huizhen, after initiating a separate lawsuit, had been awarded a judgment by the court that the principal of her claim should be 10,000 yuan, (4) four creditors, Gao He Women's Shoes, St. Anna Dance Hall, Paramount Ballroom, and another, sent letters stating that they could not attend the creditors' meeting due to lack of time but expressed their agreement with the settlement plan.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>After the report, creditor Zhao Congyan and others spoke in succession, all stating that although the amount of claims present at today's creditors' meeting did not reach three-quarters of the total registered and unregistered claims, the difference was minimal. If compared with the registered amount, it had exceeded three-quarters. They requested that the presiding committee consider the unnecessary travel of the creditors and allow the adoption of a sham resolution method to vote on the settlement plan. The presiding committee agreed. The result of the vote was a unanimous approval of the revised settlement plan proposed by the debtor. Judge Zhao ruled that the settlement plan was approved, but because the amount did not meet the legal requirement, its validity would need to be reviewed and approved by the court after the bankruptcy administrator submitted a report. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Approved Plan</p>
<p>The settlement plan approved by the creditors' vote is as follows: (1) Claims under 300 yuan will be fully settled by the debtor's family raising 40% in cash. (2) The Yong An Real Estate Company will be paid with 1,000 yuan of Jiang Zhe Bank stock that it holds as collateral. (3) Claims above 300 yuan, excluding Yong An Real Estate Company, will be settled proportionally with the proceeds from the auction of the bankrupt's assets and 15,000 yuan of Meixing Real Estate Company stock that the bankrupt's family has agreed to contribute. (4) If the above plan is fully approved by the third creditors' meeting, a representative will be appointed by the debtor's family to guarantee the implementation of the settlement.</p>

<h3>Saint John's University Student Beat Cook to Death; Fly Found in Fried Rice, One Yuan Taken as Collateral; Tragedy Occurs When It Is Not Returned After a Month</h3>
<p>Li Gan from Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, and He Cangyun from Guangdong Province, both 20 years old, were students at Saint John's University on Jessfield Road, western Shanghai. The meals for the students were contracted by Zhang Yuanquan (57 years old, from Wuxi). On June 15th of this year, Li Gan bought a plate of egg fried rice from the kitchen, costing two jiao, which was delivered to Li's dormitory by the cook, Pu A-kui. However, after Li had eaten half of it, he suddenly discovered a fly in the rice. Because the weather was hot at this time, the presence of this poisonous thing in the rice was related to hygiene, so he went to the kitchen to negotiate. At that time, Zheng Jinhai, a kitchen bookkeeper, was calculating accounts with Zhang Yuanquan. There were large and small legal currencies on the table. Li then took a one-yuan bill from the table, saying that it would be used as a temporary collateral, and that if no illness occurred after seven days, it would be returned. However, three days later, because the school had a summer vacation, all the students who lived nearby packed up and returned home. Li Gan's residence was at No. 64, Lane 381, Hardoon Road, so he also took his luggage home.</p>
<p>In the rush, he did not return the one yuan that was being held as collateral. He Cangyun, because he was from Guangdong, was far away and needed to study, so he still lived in the school. Until the 18th of this month, He's tutoring period expired and he also needed to return to his hometown. Li borrowed a book from He and needed to return it urgently, and the book was borrowed from the school library and lent to Li, and it could not be returned without a school exit certificate. Therefore, on the afternoon of this day, Li brought the book to Saint John's University to visit He Cangyun. Unexpectedly, Zhang Yuanquan and Pu A-kui asked Li to return the one yuan. There was a slight quarrel at the time. When Li handed back the book to the library and returned to the dormitory, they quarreled with Zhang, Pu, and others at the door again. Zhang and others accused Li of being a robber and snatching five silver dollars, which angered them. He Cangyun immediately went forward to reason with Zhang Yuanquan, and then started fighting, hitting Zhang's neck hard. Zhang suddenly fell to the ground injured. Zhang was taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, but the treatment was ineffective and he died at 4:10 PM. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to take Zhang's</p>
<p>body to the morgue. Li Gan and He Cangyun were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division Eight of the First Special Court. Police attorney Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for the crime of causing death by injury in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and described the above situation. According to Pu A-kui, a witness, Li took off Zhang's straw hat during the first quarrel, and during the second quarrel, because Li and others wanted to beat Zheng Jinhai, Zheng hid behind Zhang Yuanquan, and Zhang went forward to persuade them not to do it, so He Cangyun punched Zhang</p>
<p>to the ground. Zheng Jinhai also testified to everything. When questioned, Li Gan denied hitting anyone, and He Cangyun also denied punching anyone, only admitting to pushing Zhang, who then fell to the ground. They also hired lawyer Lu Xingyuan to request bail. After reviewing the confession, Judge Huang Risheng ruled that both defendants would remain in custody and be retried on Wednesday. Zhang Zongru, the prosecutor, went to the morgue to inspect the body. It was determined that the deceased Zhang Yuanquan died from injuries caused by being beaten while alive. The body was handed over to his wife, Zhang Ju, for burial after signing an agreement.</p>

<h3>Thief Drowned in Huangpu After Falling; Body Recovered with No Gunshot Wounds; Thief's Hands Bound and Covered in Wounds; Court Orders Thorough Investigation after Autopsy</h3>
<p>A clock was stolen from the Baotai Railway Station in Wusong. Railway police arrested Xie Xiaoanzi, a 25-year-old thief from Shandong, at No. 102 Yangmatou in Baotai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. After strict interrogation, the railway police patrol leader Zhang Ruixiang and police officer Li Suiming, along with two others, escorted Xie Xiaoanzi to the small wheel at Yangmatou for hanging. Xie Xiaoanzi took the opportunity to jump into the Huangpu River, and the railway police opened fire. Xie Xiaoanzi sank to the bottom of the river and drowned. The police officer on duty took the railway police officer Li Suiming into custody at the Wusong Police Station. The cause of death was initially believed to be caused by gunshot wounds. However, when the body was recovered yesterday, there were no gunshot wounds. However, the thief's hands were bound, and his whole body was covered in wounds. The arch of his feet was also injured, and was large and purple. This was evidence that the deceased had been tortured after being arrested, and the injury to the feet was caused by the bar. (The method is to place a bamboo or iron rod inside the arch of the feet, and two people step on each end, which is extremely painful.) The local police were ordered to report to the District Court. Yesterday, prosecutor Li Xulin and examiner Xuan Zhiming arrived at the scene to inspect the wounds, confirming the above-mentioned wounds and drowning before death. An order was issued to collect the body for burial and await further investigation.</p>

<h3>Chen Huizhang Case Support Association Yesterday Petitioned the Municipal Government; To Petition the Municipal Party Headquarters Today; Scheduled to Receive All Sectors and Expand Organization</h3>

<p>Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday to Punish the Culprits</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Support Association sent Zhang Shiying, Xu Yitong, and Liu Xin to petition the Municipal Government. As it was past office hours, they only submitted the petition, which read as follows: "Petition Regarding the Tragic Death of Rickshaw Puller Chen Huizhang Brutally Beaten by British Sailors, Requesting Serious Negotiations with the British Consulate to Punish the Culprits and Provide Compensation to Comfort the Spirit of the Wronged and Safeguard National Dignity. We have learned that Chen Huizhang, a rickshaw puller from Yancheng, was brutally beaten to death by three British sailors on the morning of the 8th of this month at 3 AM in front of the British Sailors' Association on Bubbling Well Road when they refused to pay the fare. The rickshaw puller's head was fractured and he died from his injuries. The Xinzha Police Station investigated and immediately arrested the murderers and brought them back to the police station. The body was inspected by Prosecutor Zhang Zongru of the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, who confirmed that he had died from serious injuries caused by being beaten while alive. Various newspapers in this city have reported on this. However, the authorities have not yet indicated how they will deal with the murderers, which causes deep anxiety. Regarding the survival of the entire nation and the relationship of international equality, all of our citizens should speak out and strive to protect our national rights and fight for the lives of our people. We, the fellow villagers from Jiangsu and Anhui in Shanghai, are closely involved and have a strong sense of responsibility, and cannot remain silent. If we do not seek to punish the murderers, how can we avenge our shame? Therefore, we publicly submit this petition to your esteemed government, requesting that you consider the importance of national rights and human life, and immediately engage in serious negotiations with the British Consulate, not stopping until the goals of punishing the murderers, apologizing, providing compensation, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again in the future are achieved. In addition to submitting this petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we respectfully submit it to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai."</p>

<p>The association is scheduled to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the First Special District Citizens' Union today to make the same request for punishing the murderers, providing compensation, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. At the same time, to enable all sectors to understand the truth, they will schedule within the next few days to host all sectors of commerce, academia, industry, and the news media to report on everything, and plan to unite all legal organizations in the city to discuss expanding the organization and future coping measures.</p>

The election of supervisory committee members resulted in the selection of Wang Yunwu, Zai Mengzou, Wang Zhuoqing, Li Zhiyun, and Zhou Juting. Zhang Jinglu and Shen Jixian were elected as alternates. (6) A proposal to amend the constitution stated that members more than six months in arrears should be removed from membership. It was also resolved that the association's constitution had not been revised for a long time and was inconsistent with current laws for industrial and commercial associations, and therefore should be amended accordingly. The interpretation of dereliction of duty by committee members was also discussed and resolved to be: (A) Repeated absence without reason for five or more consecutive times without delegating another officer of the association as a representative. (B) Failure to carry out tasks entrusted by the association without reason. Both were passed. Wang Songliang proposed raising funds to rebuild the old Booksellers' Guild building, which currently houses the Chongde Elementary School, to be rebuilt as the association's headquarters while still operating the school. The guild still had a surplus of three thousand yuan that could be allocated. Zhang Shuliang said that when the Booksellers' Chamber of Commerce and the Booksellers' Guild were ordered to reorganize into an association, the Chamber of Commerce's surplus of approximately five thousand yuan had been allocated to the association as a fund. However, the Guild's assets had not yet been transferred, and the association should not covet them. Therefore, this proposal could not be discussed unless the old Guild transferred its remaining assets. Party and government representatives agreed. Wang's proposal was retained by the association. The executive committee proposed that the association, in compliance with the Ministry of Education's order to promulgate standardized book prices, had drafted sixty-four implementation measures based on Article 3, Section 2, and Article 29 of the association's constitution, which had been announced to the industry. However, due to insufficient preparation, a notice was issued to postpone implementation for six months. However, the Ministry of Education's ten measures had been announced to the industry and should be followed uniformly. As a further step, it was proposed to revise the industry rules based on the drafted sixty-four articles or to simply pass the sixty-four articles through the general meeting. After discussion by the member representatives, it was proposed to establish a drafting committee for the industry rules, based on the sixty-four implementation measures drafted by the executive committee. The proposal was put to a vote and passed. Subsequently, nineteen companies, including Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Wenrui, Guangyi, New China, Beixin, Author, and Shanghai Magazine, were elected as drafting committee members, convened by Commercial Press, with a deadline of one month for completion. It was also resolved that the executive committee should pay special attention to the implementation of the ten measures promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and that the industry should strictly report those who failed to comply. The meeting adjourned after the discussion, at 8 PM.</p>
<h3>染業工會請撤消　印花稅處罰</h3>
<p>The Dyeing Industry Union requests the cancellation of stamp tax penalties.</p>
<p>Unions are not commercial firms or factories; receipts are not business invoices.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dyeing Industry Union yesterday petitioned the City Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union, requesting that they forward to the Central Government a request to revoke the court's ruling to penalize the union for failing to affix stamp tax to the monthly fee receipts collected from workers. The original petition stated: "We petition for a request to be forwarded to the Central Government and consulted with the Ministry of Judicial Administration, ordering the Shanghai District Court to revoke the ruling and penalty for affixing stamp tax to union monthly fee receipts. It has come to the union's attention that the monthly fee receipts issued to all workers of the Ruizhe Factory were inspected by stamp tax inspectors and deemed to have insufficient stamp tax affixed. After the Shanghai District Court filed a complaint, the union was summoned for interrogation. The union, based on 'Article 34 of the Trade Union Law, which exempts trade unions from income tax, business tax, and registration tax,' and Article 3, Section 3, of the General Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, 'Certificates issued by governments at all levels or autonomous bodies for handling public treasury funds or public funds,' and Section 8, 'Documents used internally by public or private institutions or organizations that do not create external rights and obligations,' argues that the union is a legal entity, not a commercial business, and that the receipts issued to workers are not business invoices, so there is no need to affix stamp tax. We have submitted this to the Ministry and requested the court to suspend acceptance of the case to comply with laws and regulations. Unexpectedly, the court misinterpreted the provisions and ignorantly ruled for a penalty (the ruling is attached separately) of nine yuan. The union argues strongly and has filed an appeal. We hereby specially petition your Ministry to forward this to the Central Government and quickly consult the Ministry of Judicial Administration, ordering the Shanghai District Court to immediately revoke this ruling that violates laws and regulations, for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3>陳澄醫師被控案　死者家屬請剖驗　陳醫師請將診斷書送醫學會　是否開棺剖騐須調查後再核</h3>
<p>The Case Against Dr. Chen Cheng: Family of the Deceased Requests Autopsy; Dr. Chen Requests Submission of Diagnosis to Medical Association; Whether to Exhume and Autopsy Requires Investigation and Review.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng, director of Pu'an Hospital at 451 Tangshan Road and Gongping Road intersection in Hongkou, who formerly served as a military doctor in the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and concurrently as the medical director of the Naval Shanghai Hospital and the director of surgery at Renji Hospital, was recently sued by Madame Ma Dong of Changzhou, through a lawyer, in the First Special Court's Criminal Division, alleging negligence in his professional duties leading to death. He had been summoned by Judge Feng Shide, which was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held, and both parties arrived on time. According to the plaintiff, Madame Ma Dong, her deceased son, Ma Laoda, originally worked at an umbrella factory on Tangshan Road and died after only four days of illness. Before being sent to the defendant's hospital, he had not been injected or consulted with a doctor for treatment. The body is currently at the Huaiyang Guild Hall in Zhabei, and she requests an exhumation for examination to reveal the truth. The defendant, Chen Cheng, testified that Ma Laoda stayed in a regular ward with more than ten other patients. Several of these patients have since recovered and been discharged. Furthermore, the patients who are still hospitalized stated that before the operation, his mother (the plaintiff) had given him opium to swallow, and half of it fell to the ground, which his mother searched for but could not find. The deceased's large intestine was blocked by an inch, which could only be treated by surgery. When Ma Laoda came to the hospital, he reported abdominal pain for more than ten days. Five or six days after his death, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Huishan Police Station came to investigate, and he gave them the details. This month, the plaintiff's lawyer came to inquire and said that the family had reported that if he gave some money, they would settle. He replied that he performed approximately five hundred surgeries a year, with an average mortality rate of eight percent, so how could he give money? He requested the court to summon the patients who shared the ward with the deceased and to submit the diagnosis to the medical association for review to see if there were any errors. Judge Feng stated that the case still required investigation and adjourned the hearing to the 29th. Regarding the exhumation and autopsy, it would be decided after investigating whether it was necessary.</p>

<h3>寺廟總登記</h3>
<p>General Registration of Temples</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Interior established regulations for the registration of temples, requiring all temples in provinces and cities to conduct a general registration, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau began processing in early March. The deadline for completion was the end of June. However, because there are many temples in the city, although more than 150 have applied for registration, many have not been able to submit the required documents in time. After the Shanghai Buddhist Association and Taoist Association requested an extension, the city government has forwarded the request to the Ministry of Interior for consideration. According to Article 11 of the Temple Registration Regulations, any temple that fails to register after the announcement or any newly established temple that does not apply for registration will be subject to mandatory registration. Without special reasons, the abbot or manager may be replaced. Abbots or managers of all temples should apply for registration as soon as possible to protect their rights. Registration forms can be obtained from the Social Affairs Bureau free of charge. To clarify the meaning of registration to citizens and related parties of all temples, the bureau has scheduled Lei Kenan to broadcast "The Meaning and Methods of Temple Registration" on the city government radio station at 6 PM this evening, frequency 900 kHz.</p>

<h3>樂振葆貝潤生等　被控毀証侵佔案　各被告稱原告所訴不實　案情複雜諭候改期再訊</h3>
<p>Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, and Others Accused of Destroying Evidence and Embezzlement; Defendants Claim Allegations are False; Complex Case Adjourned for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Le Zhenbao of Taichang Wood Company at 740 Nanjing Road, a native of Ningbo; Zhang Lanping, manager of Ruikang Pigment Store at 10, Lane 22, Shandong Road, a native of Suzhou; Bei Runsheng, a wealthy pigment merchant at 5, Lane 5, Beile Road; and Le Gengrong, manager of Hengli Bank on Tianjin Road, a native of Ningbo, have recently been sued in the Second Criminal Court by Ma Shangjie, 53, a native of Shaoxing residing at 3, Yideli, Laobeimen Street, French Concession, who was recently elected as the legal representative of the Shanghai West Pigment Association. They are represented by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun, alleging three crimes: handling public assets, destroying evidence, misappropriating public funds, embezzlement, and breach of trust. They request a legal investigation and reserve the right to private prosecution. Upon receipt of the complaint, the court, yesterday morning around 9 AM, dispatched Judge Chen Shuoying and Clerk Wang Baoxun to the Second Criminal Court for a hearing. The four defendants, except for Bei Runsheng, who was ill and unable to attend, along with their defense lawyers Wu Linkun and Yan Yinwu, arrived to await the hearing. The plaintiff, Ma Shangjie, arrived with his attorney, but because he suffered from a cold, he was represented by his attorney Chao Kun, who stated the intention of the prosecution: The nine industries in this city, including Western medicine and pigments, Western wood products, foreign sundries, foreign merchandise, brokers, piece goods, glass, hardware, and kerosene, jointly formed the Nine Industries Association in Zhenxingli, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, and elected the four defendants in this case to handle affairs. At the time, during the European War, the Western pigment industry made substantial profits, contributing significant capital and accounting for the largest share of the Nine Industries Association's assets. A commemorative stele was erected to last for posterity. The fund was intended for purchasing real estate and productive construction. The defendants, taking advantage of the opportunity, frequently profited from the assets, reaching a value of 500,000 yuan, managing it as private property. Furthermore, they conceived schemes to defraud, fraudulently overpaid expenses in past years, and never disclosed the accounts publicly, improperly transferring all fund revenues to Hengli Bank for their own economic control, held illegally by a third party, showing the defendants' intention to embezzle. The defendants also painted over and obliterated the stone tablet recording the names of the Nine Industries' contributors. The Nine Industries Association was renamed the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association, then the Zhenxing Club, and later again the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association. The plaintiff, believing that the defendants intended to erase the property rights of the Nine Industries, and that public associations had long been abolished by the current law, proposed to separate and recover the joint assets of the West Pigment Industry. After negotiations, the defendants initially agreed to allocate the three-story building at Zhenxingli as the West Pigment Industry's association headquarters, later changing it to a monthly allowance of 150 yuan. They then reneged on the agreement. After further negotiations, the monthly allowance was increased to 300 yuan. The defendants suddenly changed the Foreign Goods Commercial Association to the Renyi Shanhui (Benevolence and Righteousness Charity Association), turning all assets into a charitable organization and misappropriating and withholding the allowance. The plaintiff's association's 18th executive supervisory committee meeting resolved that the four defendants were guilty of repeated embezzlement, breach of trust, and destruction of evidence, violating Articles 336, 342, and 165 of the Criminal Law. They request a legal investigation. The court questioned the defendant Le Zhenbao, who stated that the Nine Industries Association was nominal. Because the foreign firm compradors and brokers could not constitute an industry, it was actually the Foreign Goods Commercial Association. He had been doing business in Shanghai for 53 years and was one of the founders of the association, attending meetings, and the property was managed by others. Zhang Lanping stated that the association was registered with the city party headquarters. The Nine Industries Association was just a colloquial term. Because the clubhouse was used to host celebrations, the Zhenxing Club was established. The stone tablet in the association was covered with lime powder by craftsmen when they built a raised floor, and there was no destruction. Le Gengrong stated that he did not manage all of the association's assets. As for the Renyi Shanhui, as a charitable organization, he was only an advisor for donations. The court, after reviewing the statements, determined that the case was complex and ordered the defendants to submit written defenses for review. The three defendants all claimed that the plaintiff's allegations were false and requested permission to file a counterclaim. As a result, the court adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 27th and then adjourned.</p>
<h3>周百興毆斃祖父案　法案今日宣判</h3>
<p>Zhou Baixing's Case of Beating His Grandfather to Death to be Pronounced Today</p>
<p>Zhou Baixing, a 19-year-old villager from Zhoujiazhai, Xisanli, Sanlintang, Pudong, was a vagrant and gambler. Late at night on June 1st of this year, he returned home after losing at gambling and asked his grandfather, Zhou Shaoqing (also known as Zhou Meiyu), for money. Instead, he was severely scolded, which enraged Baixing, who beat his grandfather. Unfortunately, the injuries were fatal, and Shaoqing died immediately. Baixing, realizing the severity of his actions, fled to Shanghai, hiding at the home of his father-in-law, Zhou Xuegen, at 139, Jia Zi, Lixuezhai, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau learned of this and dispatched Chief Constable Wang Binbo, together with the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, to arrest Baixing and bring him to the station. Because the case involved harming a relative, he was transferred to the District Court for detention the next day (June 4th). The District Court repeatedly tried the case on the 15th of this month, presided over by Judge Chen Kangyu, who declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for today (the 21st).</p>

<p>Huaihai Reclamation Area Consortium to be Established</p>
<p>Water Conservancy to be Responsible by the Provincial Government; Cotton Improvement Institute to be Established</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to borrow a large sum of money from banks in Shanghai to manage the Huaihai salt reclamation and dredge the new canal. It has invited China Communications Bank and other banks to inspect the area. Last month, various banks in this city organized an inspection tour of the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area cotton fields, visiting the Huai and Jiang areas to inspect the actual situation and organize a lending syndicate for the reclamation area. The banks are currently discussing the procedures and inviting other banks to join in cooperation. The organizational procedures are largely the same as those of the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate. The total amount of the loan must be determined by a special commissioner sent by the provincial government to Shanghai for negotiation, and then subscribed by each bank. Once it matures, a reclamation area loan syndicate will be established, with a general office in Shanghai and a branch office in Huaibei to handle the loan matters. Cotton planting will be managed by the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee, which will establish a cotton improvement institute in Huaibei to improve cotton varieties. Water conservancy projects are also being prepared. In addition to the portion allocated by the provincial government, the remaining funds needed will be borrowed from the syndicate, following the loan procedures of the Shaanxi Wei River Diversion Project, and are scheduled to be completed within five years. Starting in the sixth year, the loan will be repaid in installments. The provincial government is now planning to send Commissioner Ge to Shanghai to negotiate the loan procedures with banking leaders.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Recruiting Team Headquarters Office of the China Aeronautical Association held its 68th office meeting at the office at 2 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th) to discuss fundraising guidelines. General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretary Zhang Yuliang, and 15 others attended. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. The chairman reported that since the start of the office's recruiting and fundraising campaign, the recruiting teams have worked hard to promote it, and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically supported it. Although the market is depressed, the results are still good. The details of Shanghai citizens' enthusiasm for saving the country through aviation have been repeatedly published. Various industries continue to collect aviation-saving funds as usual. The cooked food industry automatically suggested collecting contributions in January of this year. After the office convened a meeting of the industry, it was decided to proceed and draft collection methods. The municipal government approved and announced it. However, the industry association was reorganized and temporarily suspended. Now that the reorganization committee has been established, a meeting was convened a few days ago, deciding to conduct a trial run on August 1st. It has requested assistance from party and government agencies and requested the industry to work hard on this. As for the fundraising to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a memorial for Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday, the association initiated it, and all parties responded enthusiastically. Various sectors and groups in the city, in particular, enthusiastically donated. The Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association resolved to raise 100,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft, collecting donations on goods from the industry, and drafted committee bylaws and detailed rules for donations, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. The association will earnestly assist in the process. Receipt booklets and public donation certificates for the city's districts, Tu, and Bao to raise funds for the purchase of aircraft for birthday wishes were issued by the association and began soliciting donations on July 15th. Citizens in each district expressed their love and support for the leader and donated enthusiastically, and it is expected that the results will be excellent in the future. Subsequently, the field secretaries reported on the progress of negotiations, and then discussed the fundraising guidelines. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Xu Wenliang Escapes Danger; Kidnappers Interrogated Yesterday; Further Interrogation Postponed Due to Injuries to Two Other Bandits; Xu Wenliang Testifies Good Treatment in Bandits' Lair</h3>
<p>Xu Wenliang, the Chinese manager of the Mei Foo Petroleum Company, a Cantonese man of 52 years old, residing at No. 1305 Yu Yuan Road, was suddenly invaded by seven armed bandits at approximately 3:00 AM on the 14th of this month. They robbed him of 400 yuan in cash and a diamond ring. Before leaving, they kidnapped Xu Wenliang and fired a shot. Xu's family reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, under the diligent investigation of Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Detectives Wang Xichang, Wang Yongjun, Zhou Yushan, and Kong Guangxiao, the police successively apprehended nine kidnappers in the past few days, including Cao Chunbao, Lu Laisheng, Zhang Heshang, Zhang Guiqing, Zhang Xu, Yang Chunshan, Lu Agen, Tang鶴鳴, and Shen Tingyan.</p>
<p>The hostage, Xu Wenliang, was rescued and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, except for Cao Chunbao and Shen Tingyan, who were hospitalized due to injuries, the other seven, including Lu Laisheng, were escorted to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, then rose to present the case, stating that the first defendant, Cao Chunbao, was an informant for Police Detective Wang Xichang. He had participated in prior discussions to report to the police station. However, the kidnappers discovered that Cao was an informant and abducted him along with them on July 14th. Cao was also shot and subsequently sought treatment at the Red Cross Hospital, which reported it to the police station. The police were instructed to investigate. According to Cao's testimony,</p>
<p>kidnapper Lu Laisheng was arrested on Hongqiao Road at 11:00 AM on the 18th of this month. He confessed that the hostage was hidden in a bungalow at No. 1, Yangjia Lane, Nanxiang. The police, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, went to the address and arrested Zhang Heshang and Zhang Guiqing. However, the hostage Xu Wenliang was nowhere to be found. At the same time, a bandit woman, Zhang Xu, was seen fleeing upon the arrival of the detectives. The detectives pursued her, but a dog came forward to obstruct them, barking fiercely and attempting to bite. The detectives fired a shot, killing the dog and apprehending Zhang Xu. It was then learned that the hostage had been moved to a bungalow at No. 1 Hongqiao Town. The detectives broke down the door and found the hostage inside, guarded by three bandit accomplices: Yang Chunshan, Lu Agen, and Tang鶴嗚. The hostage was rescued, and Yang, Lu, and Tang were arrested. At that time, two other bandits fled and fired to resist arrest. The detectives</p>
<p>also drew their guns and returned fire, wounding one bandit (Shen Tingyan) in the arm and legs. He was captured. The other bandit escaped. A checkbook and two wallets were found in the room, all items stolen from the victim's home. Currently, Cao Chunbao and others have not yet recovered from their injuries, so a postponement without a specific date is requested. Subsequently, the hostage Xu Wenliang testified that he stayed in the two bandits' dens for a total of five days and was treated well. The defendant Lu Laisheng was present at the scene and used a gun to kidnap me, forcing me into a green car, which went west along Zhongshan Road into the countryside. Yang Chunshan, Lu Agen, and Tang鹤鸣 took turns guarding me. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Huang Risheng ordered Lu Laisheng and others to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Chen Ze Accused of Privately Selling the Property of a Party in Litigation to Pay Public Fees; Court Orders Buyer Zuo Yaoqing to Submit the Sales Contract</h3>
<p>According to 국민社, Zhu Shisheng, a resident of Zhao's Residence, Mayushan Road, Yinxiang Port, this city, and his wife, Zhang, were wealthy and had established the Nanyang Department Store. They had one son, Miaosheng, aged thirteen, and three daughters, Zhu Fuying, the second daughter Wumei, and the youngest daughter Zhaodi, all of whom were grown and married. After Shisheng passed away in the 20th year of the Republic, the 3.3 li of rice paddy land under Zhu Qinting's name, No. 532, Tiziwei, Twenty-three Bao, Thirteen Tu, Shangyi, were inherited in five shares by Zhu Zhang, Zhu Miaosheng, and the three daughters, including Zhu Fuying. However, Zhu Zhang entrusted the title deeds to lawyer Chen Zemin, who sold the land to the local bailiff Zuo Yaoqing in the 24th year of the Republic. Now, Zhu Fuying and her two sisters have learned that they have a three-fifths shared ownership of the land and have hired lawyer Chen Kunyuan to sue their mother, Zhu Zhang, lawyer Chen Zemin, and the bailiff Zuo Yaoqing in the District Court for privately selling other people's real estate. The court approved the request and summoned them to the 14th Civil Court for interrogation yesterday (the 20th) at 9:00 AM. First, lawyer Chen Kunyuan, representing Zhu Fuying and her sisters, appeared in court, stating the object of the claim and the reasons for the lawsuit. Then, lawyer Zhao Futing, representing lawyer Chen Zemin, also appeared in court, stating that Chen Zemin was acting as Zhu Zhang's agent at the time, and the sale of the land was also Zhu Zhang's action, not a private disposal. Zuo Yaoqing appeared in court, stating, "I originally did not trust Zhu Zhang, but later, because lawyer Chen was willing to issue a receipt on her behalf, I dared to buy it. I did not initially know that the plaintiffs were co-owners." Zhu Zhang testified in court, "The land is jointly owned by five people. I did not entrust lawyer Chen Zemin to sell it. I inadvertently owed him public fees and temporarily deposited the receipt with lawyer Chen. I never signed for the sale, and I did not receive any money. Only now do I know that it has been bought by Zuo Yaoqing." At this point, the court ordered Zuo Yaoqing to submit the sales contract and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 29th of this month.</p>

<h3>Chinese Silk Exports Doubled in the Past Year</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Association, due to the poor silkworm harvest in Japan last year and the improved purchasing power of Europeans and Americans, the demand for goods was urgent, and market prices were high.

<p>Japanese merchants are purchasing grain in the Yangtze River basin, which has a significant impact on our people's food supply.

According to the reporter's investigation, Japanese merchants are purchasing a large amount of grain in Wuxi, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and other places. 30,000 bales of wheat were shipped to Japan a few days ago. Now, due to the frequent rise in wheat prices in the United States and Australia, Japanese merchants' desire to purchase from China is increasing sharply.

<h3>First Week of World Games Football; China Meets Great Britain; Japan Meets Sweden in Another Match</h3>
<p>Berlin, July 19 (Reuters) - The draw for the World Games football tournament was held today, and in the first week of matches, China will face Great Britain, and Japan will meet Sweden in another match.</p>

Therefore, although China is unfortunately meeting Great Britain in the first week of the World Games, based on the performance of our team in Southeast Asia and India, there has been considerable progress, and we will surely be able to provide Great Britain with fierce resistance.</p>

As a result, these personnel still fill various schools after two years. Therefore, we specifically request that your bureau instruct all schools not to continue hiring public education personnel who have not been reviewed or have failed the review from the next semester to uphold the law. If they continue to disobey, please have your bureau severely punish them. This is for the public good.</p>

<h3>Yu Songjun Discusses the Sino-German Midwifery School</h3>
<p>Dr. Yu Songjun, Principal of the Sino-German Midwifery School in this city, issued the following statement: This school was established in the 14th year. We dare not boast about all the past achievements, but according to the Municipal Education Bureau's general review of the 23rd annual inspection report, the school was praised for its conscientious management, adequate equipment, and comprehensive teaching and practice, and its achievements were rated as A. Recently, Zhong Daozan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education, also stated in his report on vocational education in Shanghai that the school cooperates with the Sino-German Hospital, has a large number of beds, with an average of 20 to 30 inpatients per day, and has no problem with internships. There are many teaching reference materials, and the school buildings are also suitable. The Ministry and Bureau have issued orders acknowledging the school's handling situation, which is quite commendable. This time, the Ministry of Education received a report from Principal Qu Jinqin of the Central Midwifery School stating that the school's staff was slow in their attitude, did not provide adequate service, and was considered to be slack in management. This was really unexpected. According to the investigation, Mr. Qu arrived at the school after 4:00 PM on the day of the inspection. At that time, the school's duties had already been completed. First, the academic affairs officer Mao led the tour of the entire school and the internship hospital, and then Acting Principal Wu arrived at the school to meet him. When asked if he had inspected all the departments, Mr. Qu said that he had already finished inspecting them and then left. According to the usual practice of schools, if visitors come to the school after the students have left school, even if they are refused a visit, they cannot be criticized. The staff of this school has always known to treat visitors with due respect and humbly ask for advice. When officials from the Ministry of Education come to the school, they would never dare to be slow in their attitude. However, other flattering methods are not the forte of those who run schools with high ambitions and integrity. Mr. Qu came to the school after the school had finished class. At that time, academic affairs officer Mao first led the tour of the various departments, and Acting Principal Wu rushed over to meet him. The conversation between the two parties was also very pleasant. The statement that the staff was slow in their attitude and unwilling to receive and inspect the school is not true. However, Mr. Qu is an expert in midwifery education in our country. The last time he came to our school for inspection, we were hoping that he would give detailed and practical instructions on equipment, teachers, teaching, and internships. Unexpectedly, Mr. Qu did not make any comments on the above, but only criticized the school's reception staff. This is really confusing. The case has now been submitted by the school to the Municipal Education Bureau and forwarded to the Ministry of Education, ordering Mr. Qu to clearly state which staff member of the school had a slow attitude, what the slow attitude was, whether it was serious, and whether it was considered unforgivable and had special value for being brought up, so that it can be investigated and dealt with strictly. If the staff of the school has any improper attitude, it is a matter of personal habits and character, which is purely a matter of private morality. The entire school should not be forced to suffer the consequences. Conversely, if the committee members sent by the Ministry of Education are found to have used their position to arbitrarily find fault and report untruths, they should be held fully responsible by the committee member and transferred for disciplinary action to purify the officialdom.</p>

<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School: Qinghua Primary and Secondary School at No. 428 White Road has been able to admit students to the school for all previous Shanghai Municipal Council poor children's scholarship examinations. For example, in the 22nd year, Zhou Jiye and Zhang Zudao, and in the 23rd year, Luo Qiusheng.

According to the college's admissions committee, the postponement has been approved for a few days, and examinations will be given as students arrive. However, there are not many places left, and those who are interested should register as soon as possible. It is also understood that the college, in view of the current low level of Chinese language proficiency, has difficulty in finding students who meet the advanced standards. Therefore, the advanced level only allows students to move up from the junior level and does not recruit new students. Anyone who applies for the junior level, whether they are junior high school or elementary school graduates, only needs to have a basic understanding of Chinese or be willing to study hard to take the examination. This year, special advanced classes are also set up for university and senior high school students, who are exempted from the entrance examination. However, registration must be done in person, and the tuition fee is 40 yuan per semester, which is the same as the advanced level. The courses still start with the Analects of Confucius and Mencius as the main subjects in order to instill basic knowledge of Chinese studies. However, the progress of studies is faster and only requires two years of study.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: July-August Period Flowers, Stop New Trading</h3>
<p>Today, the cotton yarn exchange market experienced tumultuous conditions for the July and August old flower markets, with sudden rises and falls, like a fierce storm. According to market rumors, there is an organized bull company inside, and the atmosphere of squeezing is also quite strong. Some firms bought a lot, while others sold a lot, making the actions extremely bizarre. It was found that on Friday (i.e., the 17th), the July outstanding balance was only 130,600 dan, and the August outstanding balance was 239,900 dan. By Saturday (i.e., the 18th), the July outstanding balance suddenly increased by 24,400 dan to 160,400 dan, and the August outstanding balance increased by 33,400 dan to 273,300 dan. The authorities, in view of the approaching delivery period, found that the number of chips had increased instead, the situation was serious, and the momentum was surging, so they should have added a special deposit of 6 yuan. However, the other party had sufficient financial resources. According to market rumors, all payments were made with cashier's checks, and the quantity was entire. Therefore, the office discussed the matter and resolved on the evening of the above day (Saturday) that, in accordance with the provisions of Items 1 and 2 of Article 157 of the Exchange Business Regulations, new trading of cotton flowers for the July and August periods will be suspended from July 20th to avoid squeezing. Therefore, when the first round opened yesterday, the July period jumped by 1.55 yuan to 51.50 yuan, and the August period followed by 0.75 yuan to 90.07 yuan. By the second round, this month suddenly fell back by 1.50 yuan, and August also fell by 0.60 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation turned slightly moderate.</p>
<p>In addition, the delivery date for the July period yarn flower is now scheduled for the 30th. The market will suspend trading in this month's yarn flowers on the 27th, 28th, and 29th, and the market will suspend meetings on the delivery day.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of Recent New Trading, the Ups and Downs of the Cotton Market, Up and Down by 1.50 Yuan, New Flowers Slightly Down by 0.60 to 0.70 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton market for new cotton fell sharply, breaking the 3 yuan mark in October, revealing the lowest price in recent times. This is due to the recent good weather, and overseas Indian and American cotton have both fallen, causing people to feel tired. However, the situation for July and August old flowers in the morning was serious, with July jumping wildly by 1.55 yuan. In view of the surging momentum, the office suspended new trading for the July and August periods. In the afternoon, the market situation turned slightly moderate.</p>
<p>(October Period Flowers Enter the 3 Yuan Mark) Before the opening of the spot flower market, the office decided to suspend new trading for the July and August periods, as the number of chips for July and August old flowers increased again on the previous day. The market was full of discussions. When the first round opened, July jumped by 1.55 yuan to 51.50 yuan, reaching the peak, and August followed by 0.75 yuan. However, new flowers were affected by the poor performance of foreign cotton and fell by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. In the second round, this month suddenly fell by 1.50 yuan, and August also fell by 0.60 yuan, but the bulls did not take action, and the distant months were flat. As a result, compared with the closing price of the previous day, July rose by 0.05 yuan, August rose by 0.50 yuan, and distant months fell by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the momentum was moderate. July remained at 50 yuan, and August hovered outside the 50 yuan mark. There were no major transactions for new flowers in the second and third rounds. By the time the market closed, old flowers had fallen back by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan, and new flowers had fallen sharply by 0.30 to 0.45 yuan. The sales registration was 1,500 dan for Chengji, 5,300 dan for Dafu, 2,100 dan for Hengyi, 1,300 dan for Juxing, 2,500 dan for Shenji, 3,300 dan for Yuanyi, 3,900 dan for Runkang, 2,500 dan for Mingde, 2,500 dan for Heyu, 2,400 dan for Taichang, and 2,600 dan for Yongda. The purchases were 8,200 dan for Yuda, 3,700 dan for Dafeng, 1,900 dan for Xiecheng, 5,100 dan for Dachang, 2,300 dan for Yuanxingchang, 2,000 dan for Changhe, 2,300 dan for Changji, and 4,700 dan for Yuanyi. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Flowers, Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Compared to Previous Day, Number of Outstanding Balances</p>
<p>July, 51.50, 49.95, 49.95, Flat, 160,400</p>
<p>August, 50.70, 50.00, 50.00, Up 0.05, 273,300</p>
<p>October, 43.45, 42.90, 42.90, Down 0.65, 357,400</p>
<p>November, 43.00, 42.65, 42.65, Down 0.65, 308,600</p>
<p>December, 43.10, 42.70, 42.70, Down 0.70, 124,200</p>
<p>Total, 1,333,910</p>
<p>Demand from Cotton Mills is Very Weak</p>
<p>The consumption of raw cotton is sluggish, and the demand from mills is extremely weak. Various parties believe that the price is high, making transactions difficult. 300 bales of Yao flowers have arrived.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Emergence of Bulls, Marked Yarn Sees a Sharp Decline, Forward Contracts Plunge by More Than Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the downward trend is intensifying, likely because American cotton continues to decline, fluctuating erratically, entirely due to the nervousness of speculators. This morning, securities firms and certain bullish parties emerged in large numbers, the market loosened, and sellers rushed in, causing the market to decline step by step. As for spot yarn, the long-dormant sales channels of the Guangdong merchants have quietly opened up recently.</p>
<p>(Marked Yarn Declines Step by Step) At the opening of the marked yarn market, both this month and August showed signs of a sharp rise, due to the intense squeezing of old cotton from July and August, creating a serious situation. Recently, yarn has been affected by this, with July and August jumping by 1.57 yuan. When auctioned for forward contracts, prices fell by 0.34 yuan to 0.78 yuan, or 1.1 yuan, with the second round of bidding still lacking strength. This was because Chengji and Tongji, along with a large number of bulls, emerged, loosening the market and causing prices to decline step by step. As a result, the price for this month rose by 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while forward contracts fell by 1.2 yuan to 0.8 yuan. At the afternoon opening, after the morning's large sell-offs, the atmosphere turned calm, and buyers were scarce. At the same time, the cotton market was mediocre, and the yarn market weakened further, with prices remaining stagnant. Changfeng and Runkang were the most active, buying and selling in quantities of one thousand. In the end, the prices for each month of marked yarn fell by 0.67 yuan to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 7,200 bales were sold by Chengji, 2,150 bales by Tongji, 2,550 bales by Fengtai, 700 bales by Yuda, 600 bales by Shenji, 3,450 bales by Dachangcheng, 800 bales by Tonghe, 850 bales by Zhenda, 1,150 bales by Hexing, 2,750 bales by Changji, and 1,300 bales by Runkang. Purchases included 1,000 bales by Dafeng, 2,250 bales by Jinchang, 2,950 bales by Senkang, 3,400 bales by Changfeng, 1,050 bales by Runkang, 2,600 bales by Shenji, 1,800 bales by Yicheng, 1,300 bales by Taixing, 900 bales by Renfeng, 950 bales by Yukang, and 850 bales by Xincheng. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weak This Past Week</h3>
<p>The Bombay cotton industry initially rose with foreign prices at the beginning of the week, but a reaction soon set in during the session. Speculators occasionally bought in, but market prices remained weak. Japan and Europe were quite active, while China was quiet. Indian yarn factories were not very active. The cotton harvest is progressing very well, except for a few areas affected by excessive rainfall. According to forecasts, rainfall will increase, but it is generally beneficial. The weekly statistics are appended below (units in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Three Grades of Yarn and Cotton are Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Osaka, 20th: Three grades of yarn futures fell by 0.1 to a rise of 1.3 yuan, with the near month at 212.9 yuan and the far month at 205.8 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.1 to a rise of 0.25 yuan, with the near month at 69.85 yuan and the far month at 64.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Only Tianjin Merchants Are Still Inert in Cotton Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the decline in yarn and cotton prices, the sentiment in the cotton cloth market was slightly softer, but piece goods manufacturers remained firm due to the high cost of cotton. Actual sales also turned better, and all goods were in short supply, showing a phenomenon of apparent looseness but actual tightness. Most selling prices were similar to last week. Sales of printed flannel, colored striped flannel, white flannel, fine cloth, fine twill, various factory serges, Zhigong crepe, printed Zhigong, serge, and flowered labels were the most active. Eastern goods fine cloth, because the selling price has already risen sharply, and the price set by various dyeing factories this month is sufficient for application, the intention to purchase has turned weak, but the spot goods are still greatly lacking. Downstream factories have the most urgent need for fine cloth. Hankou merchants are purchasing over one hundred pieces of spot goods. Merchants from Hunan and Jiangxi still have a good demand for fine cloth, fine twill, serge, and crepe de chine. Anhui merchants are also purchasing over one hundred pieces of white fine cloth and colored Hongzhang factory serge and Zhigong. Sichuan merchants continue to sell flower flannel, colored striped flannel, crepe de chine, serge, and Zhigong. Due to the stability of the situation in Guangdong, people's hearts are settled, and the Guangdong market is booming, with a shortage of goods, so the intention to purchase is extremely active. Yesterday, over five hundred packages of fine twill, fifty-sixty pieces of fine cloth, and over fifty boxes of Lun Chang flower cloth, Zhigong, and serge were transacted. Merchants from Yantai and Qingdao also have a lively intention to purchase, and yesterday they purchased over two hundred pieces of various brands of line serge from Hongzhang, Qingfeng, and Meiheng factories, but Tianjin merchants are the quietest.</p>
<h3>Grains: Futures Wheat Trading Suddenly Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market was consistently quiet across all months. Because the quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago, fell sharply by about one yuan, Canadian wheat by about eight cents, and Liverpool by a little less than half a penny, trading was light after the opening, and prices were sluggish. However, sentiment outside the industry was still good, so prices were difficult to fall significantly. By the afternoon opening, trading remained weak, and prices also hovered. Because of this kind of high market price, only outsiders buy in, while people in the industry mostly sell to hedge. Also, if foreign wheat continues to loosen, the forward contract price will get closer, and this should not be ignored. In the spot wheat market, because the handlers are selling hard, various factories are eating up large portions at 0.02 yuan. Bengbu Guandian Mingguang wheat opened at 4.55 yuan, Huaian Zhuzhen wheat at 4.46 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 4.36 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.4 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.38 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 4.45-4.46 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat at 4.3 yuan, and Wuhu wheat at 4.32 yuan. Fuxin took 10,000 packages, Shen Da took another 1,000 packages, and Fufeng took 1,000 packages.</p>
<p>Local Wheat July Large: Closing Price　July 10th Closing Price　Comparison</p>
<p>July Futures　4.51　4.50　Down 0.01</p>
<p>August Futures　4.74　4.71　Down 0.03</p>
<p>September Futures　4.94　4.92　Down 0.02</p>
<p>October Futures　5.07　5.04　Down 0.03</p>
<p>November Futures　5.16　5.12　Down 0.04</p>
<p>December Futures　5.23　5.17　Down 0.06</p>
<p>US Wheat Market: The weather is slightly cooler with showers, and wheat may be saved. The bulls took profits on a large scale, and short selling was also enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat　July 17th　July 18th　Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>September　105.125　101.75　Down 3.375</p>

<h3>Numerous Ledger Transfer Transactions for Flour Futures</h3>
<p>The flour market, in both the morning and afternoon openings, continued to trade at the new limit prices. However, it was reported that the number of transactions that went through formal procedures was small, with most being ledger transfers between the two parties. However, in unofficial dark market trades, due to the quotations for foreign wheat, sentiment turned weak. For example, the August contracts were only added 0.01 after being added 0.005, and the bulls are also willing to sell. As for spot goods from factories, which previously had to be added 0.05, it is now heard that they are no longer added, and exchange orders can be bought.</p>
<h3>The Booming Trend of New Yellow Soybeans Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although Shantou merchants and local merchants continued to purchase new yellow soybeans, the supply continued to surge, so the market was difficult to stabilize, and the overall trend was weak. Yesterday, the highest-grade goods only opened at 5.6 yuan, and the lowest price for middle-grade soybeans opened at 5.4 yuan. Inferior goods were not inquired about at all. Yesterday, the Tongshi market saw over 1,200 packages of Jiujiang Chengmen soybeans transacted. Chen soybeans, because bean cake sales are still good, factories are still willing to purchase soybeans. Yesterday, 13 carloads of Kaiyuan soybeans, 4 carloads of Bengbu soybeans, and 2,000 packages of Zhumadian soybeans were transacted. Prices were slightly weaker by 0.03-0.04 yuan compared to the previous session.</p>
<h3>Medium-Grade White Glutinous Rice Sales Are Still Good</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply of Dongyuan goods from various merchants was still scarce, with only numbers 12 and 13 arriving, totaling 2,400-2,500 piculs. The sales market in this area was slightly more active than yesterday, with merchants from Baowei, Qingdao, and Longkou purchasing 600+ packages, so the price of thick and thin rice for higher-grade goods became slightly tighter again. Middle-grade stored goods were average, and the prices of Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan were neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various routes downstream was about the 20th. The sales market for various goods on the market, white glutinous rice, high-quality materials were flat, medium-grade ones continued to sell, and the market price was high. Medium- and low-grade prices were slightly tight. White Yuan continued to be sold in retail, and the price was 0.05-0.06 yuan tighter. Bo Rice sales were neither good nor bad, and the price of scarce Yinyuan goods increased. Yangjian sales remained sluggish, and the price was at a high plateau and weak. Medium-grade prices showed a weakening trend again. The sales of port customers’ tip rice were flat, and the price was softening again. The rest of the goods remained peaceful.</p>
<h3>Large Arrival of Ke Xian Rice, Sales Also Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice sales were very strong, especially inland Ningbo. Merchants from Beiyang also started packing, and local merchants also responded, with a promising market. However, arrivals have been very strong for several days, and cargo owners also plan to take the opportunity to sell. It is found that in the last three days, there have been more than 25,000 packages of new arrivals, including more than 10,000 packages on the day before yesterday. The supply is especially strong from the Yangtze River, with the most from Jiangxi. With the strong arrival this time from Hunan and Hubei, market prices are difficult to increase. Therefore, the prices opened yesterday were similar to the previous ones, but sentiment and market atmosphere were more active. Merchants from Beiyang bought more than 1,000 packages of Xiangjing, inland and Yong merchants bought Anqing machine rice, Hankou coarse rice, and Jiangxi medium-grade rice, and local merchants only bought Jiangxi high-grade goods. It is estimated that more than 7,000 packages were opened in the city.</p>
<h3>Finance: The Gold Exchange Was Virtually Closed Yesterday Due to Unresolved Commission Issues</h3>
<p>Brokers Requesting Same-Day Settlement Transactions...As Unpaid...Reduced Fee...The Exchange Refused.</p>
<p>In order to maintain operations, the Gold Exchange Council announced that it would increase the handling fee from the 16th by 0.1 yuan per contract. After deducting the 0.025 yuan brokerage incentive, the net income would be 0.075 yuan. The brokerage community held a public meeting on the 15th to discuss the matter, believing that the principle was acceptable, but requested that it be changed to a total of 0.1 yuan for both entry and exit, deducting the 0.025 yuan incentive, which in other words is 0.0375 yuan per side, and requested a postponement to the 20th for implementation. The Council accepted the postponement, but did not approve the reduced handling fee of a net 0.075 yuan for both sides. On the 17th, the brokers held a second meeting, deciding that overnight contracts would be handled according to the revised handling fee by the Exchange, but that same-day settlement transactions would be designated as unpaid transactions and the commission would be reduced by half, and the chairman would negotiate with the Exchange on this matter. Unexpectedly, there was no result. The chairman of the brokers' association also did not clearly announce the result, leaving the brokers uncertain. Yesterday was the implementation date for the increased commission, and the brokers did not dare to rashly enter the market to trade, resulting in a virtual market closure for half a day.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bond Trading Mostly Consisted of Swaps, Market Shows a Near-High and Far-Low Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market conditions were mostly firm and stable, with trading mostly consisting of swaps. Although sellers surged, market prices were not suppressed, and most were short swaps. After the resolution of Guangdong and Guangxi, it was no longer related to the government bond market. With few days left for the July futures, there should still be some squeezing of chips. Most of those delivering goods were Number 47, while those receiving goods were mostly from Sichuan. About 40 million in futures remain for this month. Long positions have already made a profit and should seek an exit. Short positions will not easily have unexpected opportunities, and there is no other way but to cut losses or swap. After delivery, the government bond market can also tend to be stable. Yesterday, sellers such as numbers 11, 21, and 48 were quite enthusiastic. The short swaps of Number 35 were also very lively, while buying in Number 4 and Number 20 was very lively. Retail investors also bought more and sold less, and market prices continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. The trend is still extremely firm. In the second session, Number 14 sold even more than Number 11, Number 4 continued to raise prices, and short swaps were the most lively, uniformly showing a near-high and far-low trend. As a result, market prices mostly continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, with the July Type A rising the most at 0.55 yuan, while the distant-term Type C and Type D were still slightly down by 0.05. The total number of transactions was 970,000 yuan. The results of the increase are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Market Rose in the Morning, Returned in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Recently, overseas silk prices have frequently risen, but recently they have gradually declined again.

However, according to confirmed information, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that the total cocoon harvest in Japan this year is expected to be 39,498,990 kan, decreasing by 1.6% compared to last year's actual harvest, so the market gradually loosened, and New York silk prices also softened.

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Han Mei)</p>
<p>Many women in the world monitor their husbands' actions very carefully; however, they neither ask nor hear about the life and death of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>Many young women in the world shout the slogan of "equal rights for men and women"; however, when they are in front of their lovers, they say: "You men should give us women a little bit!"</p>
<p>Many moral gentlemen in the world believe that co-education of men and women is harmful to social customs, and that wearing shorts and bare arms is detrimental to decency; however, when they see a prostitute's handkerchief, they still write poems, and when they encounter the tomb of a concubine, they still fill in lyrics. It is really impossible to guess what they are thinking.</p>
<p>The word "chaste and virtuous" was almost an exclusive gold lettered signboard in the "old etiquette" society. For its sake, women sacrificed countless precious lives.</p>
<h3>Merchants of Armaments in the Sky</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Cannons and firearms are in demand now, but not as urgently as airplanes. Cannons are relatively easy to obtain, but airplanes are difficult. Therefore, modern merchants of smuggled arms have shifted their focus to airplanes. Some small countries are willing to pay high prices to buy all kinds of aircraft. In England, no arms of any kind can be exported without the permission of the Foreign Office, and those permitted for export are issued a license, but the export of aircraft for commercial use is not prohibited. Taking advantage of this, aircraft can be disguised as commercial aircraft and shipped to various neutral countries. Within a few hours, these outwardly peaceful passenger planes can be transformed into fierce and brutal instruments of war. Then they are transported to the countries that buy the aircraft. In this way, the ban on exports is observed, and arms smugglers can still move freely.</p>
<p>The smuggling of aircraft began during the war between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America. The first to think of doing this business was a young engineer with a spirit of adventure. Using many aliases, he bought up all the old airplanes and various machine parts for sale on the market. To avoid all kinds of disadvantages to his business, he secretly loaded the old aircraft and various machine parts onto trucks at night and transported them to the basement of an abandoned church for safekeeping, preparing to ship them overseas in a few days when the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>One night his secret was almost discovered, but fortunately, he was quick-witted, otherwise, it would have been very dangerous. It turned out that he was busily unloading airplane parts from a truck when a town policeman came riding a bicycle. Suddenly, the policeman stopped his bicycle, took out a flashlight and shone it, and shouted, "Hey, what are you doing?" The engineer calmly and without hesitation replied, "Nothing. These are all cheap piano parts. I'm going to put them together and make complete pianos. I find it much cheaper to hide them in the basement of the church, because the rent is very low."</p>
<h3>Casual Chats by the Sea</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Snow lotus root and ice peaches are fresh seasonal products again. Shanghai's peaches have always been famous. As far as I know, there are Huangniqiang peaches, Luxiangyuan peaches, and Longhua peaches.</p>
<p>The old site of Huangniqiang is now the Penglai Market. The owner of the garden at that time, surnamed Wei, named Jietang, was an elegant gentleman who lived in seclusion in horticulture. He was a widower and never remarried, and had no children. In addition to growing peaches, he also kept a Pekingese dog, in the style of Lin Hejing's plum wife and crane children. This dog was very fierce, and it is said that Dongfang Shuo, who often stole peaches at night, had to guard against it. The garden was originally named "Yishou", which was taken from the "Classic of Divine Wonders": "There is a tree in the east called peach. Its seeds and kernels are made into soup, and eating it will bring longevity". The plaque was written by Xiaolian Gong Feng Zichen in the style of Dong Xiangguang, which was very elegant. Because its surrounding wall was made of yellow mud, common people called it Huangniqiang, and the name Yishou was overshadowed and not well-known. Every summer, the red fruits were lush, and the green leaves set off a special kind of scenery. For two hundred cash, one could be admitted as an honored guest, sipping tea and resting under the peach trees, and arbitrarily designating the giant peaches on the treetops, which the gardener would pick for them to eat as much as they liked. However, they could not be taken out. Later, many inferior peaches outside pretended to be Huangniqiang peaches, and some even used moth-eaten peaches, filling the moth holes with lamp wicks, and then covering them with peach fuzz. Not long after, Wei Jietang died, and Huangniqiang also became overgrown with weeds.</p>
<p>Today, there is still a Luxiangyuan Street in Nine Acres. Originally, Luxiangyuan, along with Heyuyuan and Risheyuan, were known as the three major gardens by the sea. Unfortunately, these three major gardens have all become relics of the past. The Luxiangyuan honey peaches have a vermilion circle on the skin, which is said to be added to the peaches every time there is a thunderstorm, so they are called "Leizhenhong". They were used by local officials to offer to their superiors, and because the output was small, ordinary people could not easily taste them.</p>
<p>Longhua pan peaches still exist today, and compete with Yulu peaches and Zichun peaches for a day's length. About three miles from Longhua Temple, there is a place called Yujiawan, which is the most abundant place for peach blossoms. The Longhua pan peaches that hawkers call in the market are products of Yujiawan. It is said that Longhua pan peaches are also sold in Tokyo, Japan. Not only are they sweet and delicious, but they also have no pits, and are grown scientifically from Longhua pan peach seeds.</p>
<h3>Notes on What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Huang)</p>
<p>——The Ticket Seller's Face, the Dividing Line Between England and France——</p>
<p>My wife and I took our two children to the West Gate by tram. This tram passes through the British and French Concession territories. As usual, I first bought tickets to Dongxinqiao Station, the junction of the concession areas, and handed the ticket seller the money for two tickets. Unexpectedly, he politely refused to take the money and winked at me. From this sneaky behavior, I realized that he wanted to skim money (the common Shanghai expression for obtaining illicit money) and wanted me to keep it for him temporarily. This was probably because he was afraid that the ticket inspector would get on the tram. He could pretend to be busy and not have sold the tickets. This was meant to build a defensive line in advance. I thought to myself: Why should I be happy to fulfill this unexpected obligation for him personally, and even shoulder the guilt of colluding in fraud? But I finally followed his hint and kept the copper coins, dense with microorganisms, in my palm until we arrived at the station and they were taken away. He did not express any gratitude, and I felt as if I had handed over a public affair without any objection. This has become a common practice in public places.</p>
<p>Then, the tram entered the French Concession territory, and I took out the amount for two tickets again and handed it to the ticket seller. The ticket seller was still the same person, but his face immediately became solemn and he said in a lecturing tone: "You must buy four tickets, no bargaining!" I understood that it was the children's due obligation, and I paid the extra fare to him between the tones of his urging "Be quick!" After selling the tickets, he chatted with other passengers as if to express his feelings, "The French regulations are fierce! Children of four years old have to buy tickets. If you are not careful, you will be severely punished!"</p>
<p>So, on the ticket seller's face, I discovered a tram route map, on which the boundary lines between the British and French Concessions were divided very clearly, very clearly!</p>
<h3>Swapping the Phoenix and the Luan</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; Quiet Night, Alone, Write a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>Although these bamboo tips are not different from usual, at this moment, they seem to have a lot of meaning, so he slowly walks along, finishing looking at these bamboo tips, and exits the alley. Guoqii stops, and looks back, but this alley, more than ever, seems more lonely, and even the shouts of street vendors selling things, cannot be heard at all. He no longer hesitates, going straight home. After arriving at home, he only calls out to his mother, before going to his study, both arms embracing along the edge of the desk, his own gaze blank, staring at the stationery, the idol of Venus, lost in thought. Luckily, the family maid, Liu Ma, has already been rehired, and her coming and going in and out of the room, is unrelated to her young master's attitude, she does not much care. When it is time to eat lunch, Liu Ma calls him several times, only then does he slowly rise from the desk, then, frowning, he walks toward the main room. But as soon as he walks out the door, his face immediately pushes down into a smile, to his mother, saying: Today's lunch is very early. Mother Zhang says: No. I thought it would be twenty or thirty minutes later than usual, and that you would be anxious. Why do you say it is early? Guoqi says: But I am not complaining that lunch is late. In the study, I casually flipped through two pages of a book, and then forgot about the time for lunch. Mother Zhang said, do not speak so much, quickly eat, perhaps this is already interrupting your time. Guoqii hearing these words, his face turns red; thinking that the matter of missing time, mother also knows about it? But stealing a look at the old woman's expression, she is very generous, very kind. Her face is the same as usual, not bringing any doubtful appearance, only then does he relax, sit down, and calmly eat. After lunch, Mother Zhang points to the wall clock, saying: It is already one o'clock, shouldn't you be going to school? Guoqii hearing this reminder, his heart moves again, but looking at his mother's attitude, he is still leaning on the edge of the table, lifting his face slightly, looking at others with a kind smile. It's as if his heart is filled with longing, and with comfort. (50)</p>
<h3>Fragrant and Stinky Fan Ribs</h3>
<p>— Qing Shou</p>
<p>Fan ribs with a fragrance, such as those made of sandalwood, are commonly seen today and are not considered unusual, but there are also those who specifically take foul odors for the purpose of repelling heat and warding off plague, which few people know about. Let me describe their names, one is "Asafoetida," and the other is "Musk." These two items are both medicinal products, but one is fragrant and the other is foul-smelling. By putting them on the upper end of the fan ribs and smelling them from time to time, they are very suitable for hygiene during hot summer travel.</p>
<p>"Asafoetida" is a type of plant, a perennial herb with leaves resembling carrots and small yellow flowers clustered like an umbrella. The roots are rich in white juice, which flows out like a stream when cut, thick and more so than milk. After drying, it gradually solidifies, and its properties generate a foul odor, but this kind of odor can dispel evil and avoid epidemics. Therefore, purchase one or two coins from a pharmacy and place them on the upper end of the large ribs of the fan, sticking them into a semi-circular shape, like a raised mound. To prevent it from falling off, lightly scrape the surface of the bone with a knife to create friction, so that it can be permanently fixed. Between summer and autumn, it can both dispel heat and cover the nose, serving two purposes with one item, making it a good product.</p>
<p>"Musk" is produced in Sichuan and Yunnan. Females have no fragrance, only the lower part of the male's umbilicus has a glandular sac, which secretes fluid from time to time, and its fragrance can be heard in the fields. Therefore, hunters often use their sense of smell to find its whereabouts. Its shape resembles a small deer, and its patterns resemble tigers and leopards. Its secretions are fragrant, and when pursued by people, it throws itself off high cliffs, stretches out its claws to pick out its fragrance, and even in death, arches its limbs to protect its navel. The preciousness of this item can be imagined. Today, it is also an important product in national medical prescriptions. However, counterfeit musk lacks strong fragrance, so one must have discerning knowledge when purchasing it. If it is genuine, only one or two fen are needed to be inserted into the large ribs of the fan, and when you raise your hand and gently shake it, the fragrance will pierce your nostrils, sometimes even filling a room, making it a truly unique product. The best fan ribs are those with carved flowers, and they can be poured into the extremely fine gaps, which can last for a long time. However, musk powder should be kept away from dryness and contact with camphor and sulfur, otherwise, it will lose its inherent properties and must be handled with care.</p>
<p>However, these fragrant and foul-smelling fan ribs are rarely seen in recent times. Yesterday, in Tayin, I saw Dr. Yao Shuyun having these two handles, and also heard about their origins, so I have described them in this way.</p>

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes About Observing the Solar Eclipse in Japan</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>There is also a superstition in Japanese folk beliefs about solar eclipses. It is said that after a solar eclipse, neither the man nor the woman who gets married will be satisfied and it will be difficult to grow old together. Therefore, this solar eclipse led to early marriages in the farming areas of northern Japan. The women, however, did not know about the solar eclipse beforehand and were not prepared at all, causing them great distress.</p>
<p>British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington began his first observation of a solar eclipse in 1914 and is now observing it for the sixth time. He spent six weeks at sea and more than fifty days preparing before he had the observation equipment set up, hoping to return with good results from Japan. This time he observed it in Kamishari, but it rained for 18 days, making him very anxious. Seeing the villagers praying for clear weather at the Kamishari Shrine, he was curious and went to burn incense as well. But the shrine was not effective, and on the 19th, the day of the solar eclipse, the sky was full of dark clouds, and even the sun could not be seen clearly. He had no choice but to hang his head in disappointment, disassemble the equipment, and prepare to return home. Eddington's team was staying at the Kamishari Elementary School, and the bedroom was converted from a women's sewing room. His accompanying students had not yet learned Japanese customs, and not only did they walk on the tatami mats with their leather shoes, but they also left footprints on the bedding laid on the mats.</p>
<p>Dr. De Joer of the Czech observation team living in Nakatonbetsu seemed to have been to Japan before. The other three were there for the first time. After that, there was a pool full of soapy water, making it impossible for anyone to bathe, so it had to be completely discarded. They also did not understand Japanese, and the old woman managing the bathhouse really did not know what to do with them. Our country's technician Yu Qingsong and Ms. Zou lived in Esashi, near Nakatonbetsu, and obtained unexpectedly satisfactory results. Dr. Fielder got along very well with Yu, and they have traveled together to our country to visit the Nanjing Observatory.</p>
<p>Dr. Nishina of the Japanese Institute of Physics and Chemistry lived alone in a small hut on Mount Shari to observe, which is a day's journey from Sapporo. To facilitate communication, he used two people to transport mail and telegrams. Each person walked back and forth carrying only a few very light letters and received a reward of two and a half yen. This was because not only was the mountain road rugged, but there was also a high risk of encountering bears along the way. But the meticulousness of the Japanese postal service is admirable.</p>
<p>The weather forecast for the 19th was easterly winds, cloudy, with local showers. Later, southerly winds, partly sunny, southerly winds turning easterly at night, often cloudy. But when they got up early in the morning, it was raining heavily. The rain stopped in the afternoon, and there was a faint sunlight in the dark clouds, so the Central Meteorological Observatory's telephones became very busy, but where could it be seen clearly. The Ueno Science Museum was full of disappointed female students. The small telescopes of various schools were completely useless and could only listen to the teachers' "Solar Eclipse Lectures" in the classroom for consolation.</p>

<h3>One Monk, One Portion of Vegetarian Food</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>It's indeed a good example of individual portions!</p>
<p>When monks eat vegetarian food, each person gets one portion. The food is placed on the table in advance, and there is silence during the meal. Even making slurping noises when drinking porridge is not allowed. A bowl can slightly prevent flies from touching the food. Their dishes are vegetarian, several vegetables cooked together. They don't get much animal protein. From the perspective of national prosperity, the nourishment is certainly insufficient. However, for the sake of their desire to be pure of heart and have few desires, not eating animal food is quite right. Not allowing slurping noises when drinking porridge is certainly an overcorrection, but it is not right to always eat and talk at the same time, with the uvula (little tongue) busily working without end, inevitably making mistakes and causing food to enter the trachea and causing choking. And what is especially enviable about monks eating vegetarian food is the individual portion method.</p>
<p>Usually, in the case of someone suffering from cholera, dysentery, or intestinal fever, most people easily know that it is not appropriate to share food with them. When someone has diphtheria, everyone also easily knows that it is not appropriate to share food with them. But when encountering a patient with not very serious tuberculosis, a syphilis patient whose face has not yet shown unsightly signs, or someone who clearly has a sore throat or toothache, people think it doesn't matter and share food with them nonchalantly, not caring at all. As for people who do not show any symptoms, in the eyes of most people, they are thought to be good people, not patients, and there is no need to share food separately with them. Little do they know that in the mouths of healthy people, there are actually often two kinds of microorganisms living in symbiosis, one called Fusobacterium and the other called Borrelia vincentii. These two microorganisms multiply especially when there is bad breath. Sometimes, when the gums are swollen and painful, the mouth is full of acute inflammation (people with bad teeth and those who do not practice oral hygiene are especially prone to this situation), or when the throat develops tonsillitis, it is these two little things that are causing trouble. Furthermore, the tonsils on the left and right sides of the throat, the upper wall of the throat, and the base of the tongue often contain a streptococcus. When the tonsils of middle-aged or young people slowly become enlarged and inflamed, causing the throat to swell, making swallowing and spitting difficult (commonly known as throat obstruction), or when they suddenly become inflamed, causing swelling, pain, and fever (commonly known as throat moth), it is also these bacteria that usually hide inside that are causing trouble. People who do not have diphtheria and have not been in contact with diphtheria patients often have diphtheria bacteria in their mouths (of course, some contain non-toxic bacteria that do not cause diphtheria). People who are close to diphtheria patients often carry the bacteria, but they themselves may still not get sick and remain as healthy as usual. There are also many other diseases transmitted through sputum and saliva, such as cerebrospinal meningitis. In the case of the two chronic and deadly infectious diseases, tuberculosis and syphilis, sometimes the patient endures it, and even they themselves do not know, or they and others think that they have been cured long ago. In reality, there may still be a possibility of infection from the utensils they use. As for those who have obvious sputum and saliva-transmitted diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis, or syphilis, in which microorganisms have spread throughout the body, there are special toxic bacteria in their mouths, letting you know that separating food from them accounts for only one or two ten-thousandths of the danger of transmission. Things spat out from other people's mouths, unless it is a baby who doesn't understand anything, or a love-struck person who doesn't care about anything, are probably considered dirty by everyone. So, you should know that when sharing dishes, naturally, when you raise your chopsticks to take food and bring it to your mouth, it is inevitable to exchange some saliva and household bacteria with others on the chopsticks.</p>
<p>The saying, "One monk, one portion of vegetarian food," is a metaphor, emphasizing that a "monk" should be given a portion of "vegetarian food." However, in fact, monks do put aside one portion per person when eating vegetarian food, so the author has focused on the importance of quantity and attached it to the hygienic method of separate portions. However, even if it is humble with no high-minded argument, what about imitating the individual portion system from a hygienic perspective in a school or organization? It's certainly easy, but in a family, it is always somewhat difficult to implement a sudden large-scale reform. If families can adopt a system of sharing dishes and separating portions, preparing more chopsticks and spoons as communal eating utensils, and separately preparing chopsticks, spoons, and bowls that are sent to the mouth, designated by parents, siblings, aunts, and sisters for exclusive use by one person, that is already excellent. In reality, if a family is certain that everyone is healthy and has no ailments, and that everyone pays attention to oral hygiene, then it is originally okay to share food normally. In case someone is found to have a sore throat, toothache, or various infectious diseases transmitted through oral and nasal excretions (including colds) and oral mucosal contact, you can temporarily refer to the system of monks eating vegetarian food, teaching this family member with the ailment to temporarily eat separately, becoming a "carnivorous monk" and learning to practice Zen. But this is the minimum method. When necessary, it is of course necessary to be able to implement it. Accordingly, when people in urban areas invite guests to banquets, they do not necessarily have to "hang up the sign of a foreign merchant" and eat Western food. They can explore the spirit of "I love their etiquette because you love their sheep" and return the "pearl" for the "calf", eating Chinese food in a Western style, which is both simple and clean. However, there are not many restaurants preparing Chinese food in a Western style in various places now, and when there are, the prices are often more expensive than Western food, which is really off-putting.</p>
<p>Overly sensitive friends may look at the poverty of society and think that (separate portions require sufficient food first. The "beggars" who snatch leftover food from delivery people on the Shanghai Bund have not all died from being unhygienic. Most people in the inland just need enough to eat, how can they talk about separating plates and unimportant separate portions?). If someone thinks this way, then, friends! You must know that while hygiene is closely related to social problems, it also has a natural distinction. Hygiene here is connected to "having enough food to eat is a prerequisite for talking about separate portions," and further encourages people to "implement separate portions even when there is enough food to eat."</p>
<h3>A Report on Inspecting the North Sea Islands of Germany (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Management Methods: Among hundreds of children, they are divided into several small teams, each team has a captain and staff in charge of various affairs. There are classes such as gymnastics, singing, and drawing. There are also teachers lecturing on the ground while the children are seated in rows under the trees.</p>
<p>The most important staff members are the food manager, the laundry manager, and the general affairs manager, who are assisted by seven people. In addition, there are twelve other staff members who specialize in various services, and there is a separate manager for the garden.</p>
<p>Economic Situation: Each child pays the academy three marks per day, which is the only source of funding for the academy. However, this can only maintain daily expenses. Expansion or repairs require separate fundraising methods.</p>
<p>Principal's Speech: The principal gives a speech to the children leaving the academy every time, saying: "I sincerely wish you happiness, but I hope you will not forget everything in the past. When you came to the island, weren't your faces not very pale? Now they are red and lively. Therefore, please do not forget all the courses here. Go to bed early and sleep soundly. In the morning, wash your face and rub your chest with cold water. Please ask your mother to rub your back as well. Bedding should be tidy and clean and receive plenty of sunlight. You should often wander around the sports field and the bright lake, and the riverbank, no matter how far or near. You must know that exercise can strengthen your muscles and bones, making you intelligent and courageous. Brush your teeth before bed and wash your feet before bed. Everything must be orderly and maintain good health. Not only that, but also pay attention to moral and intellectual education, so that you will become good citizens in the future."</p>
<h3>The Sanatorium for Young Women on Fohr Island</h3>
<p>This sanatorium was established in 1929 at a construction cost of 1.7 million marks. It occupies one hundred acres of land and is located in the northwest of the island. Next to the sanatorium is a beach for seaside activities. The sanatorium is managed by the national insurance agency and is specifically for female employees suffering from illness who need to recuperate, free of charge.</p>
<p>The entire sanatorium is roughly in the shape of the sun and has a total of 130 beds. The monthly operating cost is over 30,000 marks, averaging 10.5 marks per person per day. Because the operating room is rarely used and there are no expenses for medicine or interest on the sanatorium's property, costs are particularly low. Most rooms are for two people and face southeast, each with a separate balcony and hot and cold water facilities in the wall cupboards. The ground floor has washing rooms for those recovering to wash their faces after bathing in the sea or exercising. There is a large X-ray room, more than ten massage rooms, and an indoor swimming pool that uses machinery to draw in seawater and maintain a constant temperature. Three sides have windows, and the four walls are tiled in light green. The size and color of the location are very similar to the reception hall of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in our country. Behind it is an indoor sports ground. One end of the room has a stage for meetings, speeches, movies, music, and dramas. The center of the first floor is the front hall, with a reading room on the left and a game room on the right, equipped with things like chess pieces. The room is light yellow and decorated with several flower arrangements, making it elegant and refined. Beyond the front hall is the main staircase, ten meters long and wide. The four walls are light red, mixed with vermilion rafters and bright mirrors, creating a splendid and solemn atmosphere. At the end of the right corridor is the large dining hall, with lattice windows on all sides. The walls are made of natural wood, and the lighting uses linear lighting fixtures. The wall lamps in each room are purely circular, exactly the same as those used in the Hongqiao Sanatorium and from the same manufacturer. The operating room is also located facing north, with walls of matte gray tiles. The lighting also uses shadowless lighting fixtures from the same manufacturer as those used in the Hongqiao Sanatorium. The world is so large, yet such coincidences occur.</p>
<p>In summary, the characteristics of the sanatorium, in addition to the therapeutic nature of the ocean air in terms of geography, include all bedrooms facing south, each room having an attached balcony, and the offices facing north, the same as the Hongqiao Sanatorium. The sanatorium pays attention to the harmony of colors, with each floor being different. Even the doors, if red, have black door frames, or are shaded, such as light gray, dark gray, light green, and dark green. The color scheme of the Hongqiao Sanatorium is also different on each floor. However, the sanatorium's colors are particularly bright to suit the psychology of young women, and the tranquil scenery is generally similar, without the disadvantage of white causing glare. The sanatorium's bedroom furniture is all made of steel, while the Hongqiao Sanatorium uses chrome-plated steel furniture, which does not rust, which is an advantage. The various lighting equipment, soundproofing equipment in the corridors, and the installation of wall cupboards, hot and cold water pipes, and steam pipes in each room are all exactly the same.</p>
<p>According to the director, Mr. Clais, the sanatorium was established in the year when Germany experienced the most severe period. The seriousness of unemployment, the changes in the political situation, internal worries, and external troubles all came together. However, the government did not abandon its construction policy because of this. The magnificent sanatorium for young women on the coast of the North Sea was still completed according to the original plan. At that time, 30% of the patients admitted to the sanatorium were malnourished, but now it has been reduced to 16%. From this, we can see the progress of the general social situation. The average number of days of hospitalization is 42 days. The treatment methods are all based on natural recuperation and do not use drugs. For example, people suffering from insomnia can often sleep soundly by taking a warm bath. However, the result of the treatment is always based on the direct marine climate. If the windows are tightly closed indoors and the direct marine climate cannot be enjoyed, the results are often poor. Therefore, patients must pay attention to their ability to adapt to the climate, because the marine climate is extremely stimulating. It can have a therapeutic effect on the human body, but if used carelessly, it can also be harmful. Therefore, under what circumstances should one come here for treatment?</p>
<p>Readers should consider whether this beautiful paradise for young women, built on the coast of the North Sea by utilizing the authority of modern science, gathering the intelligence of many experts, and spending huge amounts of money (averaging 17,000 marks per bed, while the Hongqiao Sanatorium in our country averages 10,000 taels of silver per room), is truly without flaws. It is not. The construction of the country is based on seeking the welfare of the public as a prerequisite. For ordinary shop assistants, their daily lives are mostly based on hard work and diligence. But once they get sick, they come here and live in comfort, as if entering heaven. Although recovery is expected, if they return to their old jobs in the future, they will inevitably feel as if they have fallen back into hardship, and they will not be able to get used to everything. Therefore, although the intention of this kind of national construction is good, it cannot be enjoyed by the public every day.</p>
<p>Hui Kang said that the islands of this number were a desolate area many years ago. Apart from the natural marine climate, there was no special scenery to speak of. However, after the Germans managed them, they not only became important medical recuperation areas, but will also become famous summer resorts in Northern Europe. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people come to these resorts for summer vacation and recuperation. Taking Fohr Island as an example, more than 20,000 children come for recuperation every year, which directly has a great effect on the families of the sick. Indirectly, it increases the productivity of the country, I do not know how much. Alas, how prosperous it is! Moreover, Dr. Hai Bailing sacrificed his life's energy to specialize in the study of marine recuperation and to manage the island, and did not hesitate to destroy his entire family. His courage and perseverance, and his attitude towards academic research, are all worthy of our respect. Our country has the most long-standing cultural history, the most fertile land, mountains and rivers, and the coastal islands are all beautiful. Taking Putuo as an example, it is a hundred times better than Fohr Island. However, I have never heard of any new construction. Is it true that there is no one in China? Can human power not overcome nature? Or are we still sound asleep, abandoning ourselves? Alas, seeing Hai's destruction of his family to build the island, it can also inspire us.</p>
<h3>Difficulties and Solutions in Rural Hygiene (I)</h3>
<p>— Liu Nong</p>
<p>In the era of rural revitalization, hygiene is also an extremely important matter, and is recognized by contemporary medical experts as an event that should be implemented urgently. In recent years, the authorities have attached great importance to rural hygiene, and have been continuously promoting it in rural areas across the country. The author has also done a lot of hygiene work in rural areas. Based on past observations and experiences, I feel that there are many difficulties that are very different from those in cities. There are twelve points that I would like to bring up for everyone to discuss:</p>
<p>Farmers' knowledge is simple: Because very few farmers have received education, their knowledge is simple. It is difficult for them to accept the hygiene knowledge that is instilled in them, and therefore, the effectiveness is smaller.</p>
<p>Superstition is too deep: For thousands of years, the idea of protecting gods and worshiping Buddha has been deeply imprinted in their minds. Whether diseases are good or bad depends on the gods. If scientific treatment is introduced to them, they rarely believe it.</p>
<p>Inconvenient transportation: The roads in the countryside are rugged, either mountains or water. Once it rains, the roads are muddy up to the knees. There are no means of transportation at all. Therefore, most of the work outside is done on foot. So, with the same number of workers, the time spent on the journey takes up too much time, the working time is shortened, and the effectiveness is also reduced. Because the working time is shortened, the effectiveness is also reduced, and more work is difficult to carry out due to inconvenient transportation.</p>
<p>Economic difficulties: Throughout the entire Chinese rural society, everywhere shows a recession. Because of economic relations, hygiene facilities have to be simple, and the mortality rate and disease rate are naturally higher than in cities.</p>
<p>Few people serve in the countryside: Because the environment in the countryside is relatively poor and suppressed by the economy, the treatment for staff is lower than in cities. At the same time, people working in the countryside suffer more and live uncomfortably. The number of people who are happy to work in the countryside naturally decreases. Sometimes, due to inconvenient transportation, it is very common to walk ten or eight miles out of the house. In the summer, under the scorching sun, and in the winter, in the rain and snow, when you encounter a delivery or an emergency illness, you cannot refuse to go. Only those who can endure this kind of suffering with a true spirit of service can do it, otherwise, they will only fail.</p>
<p>Simple equipment: Due to economic and frugal relations in rural areas, all equipment tends to be simple. Each job cannot be responsible by specialized personnel. When hiring people, you must hire people who know and are responsible for everything, but in the various places where rural hygiene is now being handled, they hire people mostly based on the amount of money. The people who are hired must not only be able to endure hardship and work hard, but also be able to produce effective work from simple equipment. This is really a very difficult event.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>3.  Thorn Apple Datura Tatula, L.</p>
<p>Stechapfel (German) Thorn apple (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) Originally from America, it has since grown in various places, and is an annual herb. Its shape is similar to Datura alba. The stem is purple. The leaves are oval with wavy serrated edges. The flowers are pale purple. The capsules are oval and densely covered with thorns. The seeds are granular and black.</p>
<p>White-flowered Thorn Apple D. Stramonium, L., the shape is generally the same as the previous species, but the stem is light green and the flowers are white.</p>
<p>(Medicine) Datura Leaf Folium Stramonii, is collected when the aforementioned two plants are in bloom, and dried. The leaves are oval, up to two decimeters long, with curved edges and serrated teeth, the tips are sharp, and the bases are wedge-shaped. The leaf surface is not hairy. The petiole is about two centimeters long.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The leaves contain about 0.4% of total alkaloids, the main component of which is Hyoscyamin C17H23NO3, with a small amount of alkaloids. It also contains a trace amount of niter KNO.</p>
<p>The seeds contain about 0.4% of total alkaloids, mainly Hyoscyamin. It also contains about 25% of fatty oil, mainly Palmitin and Stearin.</p>
<p>(Medicinal) Datura leaves can be used to make asthma tobacco. The German Pharmacopoeia contains the method for preparing asthma tobacco Folia Stramonii nitrati (Asthmakraut) as follows.</p>
<p>Datura leaves (finely cut) 600, Potassium Carbonate 1.0, Potassium Chlorate 4.0, Potassium Nitrate 200, Water 400.</p>
<p>First, dissolve the salts in warm water, then immerse the leaves to absorb the solution, and dry them. The seeds are suitable for use as raw materials for the manufacture of Hyoscyamin or Atropin.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Teeth (38)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 196) What should be done to treat tooth neck pain?</p>
<p>Answer: If the neck of the tooth is corroded into a groove (but not a cavity, not black) and causes pain, it should be filled. If the gums recede and the root of the tooth is exposed, causing sensitivity, the dentist should apply silver nitrate solution.</p>
<p>(Question 197) Can discolored teeth be restored to their original color?</p>
<p>Answer: Teeth sometimes turn brown, yellow, black, or green due to pulp necrosis, the use of clove oil or silver nitrate, or other reasons, which is very unsightly. If you ask a dentist to bleach them with appropriate methods, they can be restored to their original color.</p>
<p>(Question 198) What should be done to treat teeth when they are injured by falls or other external forces?</p>
<p>Answer: If severe pain occurs, you must first stop the pain, and then extract the pulp. The affected tooth should rest and not bite on things. If the external injury is very serious and periodontitis and suppuration occur, the affected tooth must be extracted. If there is a fracture of the alveolar bone, it must also be removed at the same time.</p>
<p>Section 7 Filling Teeth</p>
<p>(Question 199) Will using a drill to drill teeth when filling cavities damage the teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: If the decayed part of the cavity is not drilled clean, it cannot be fully disinfected, and the filling will definitely not be good. Therefore, drilling teeth when filling cavities is beneficial and harmless.</p>
<p>(Question 200) What is the most common material used to fill teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: It is a silver-colored alloy, commonly called silver amalgam, which is very strong and durable.</p>
<p>(Question 201) What material should be used to fill the front teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: White porcelain powder should be used. It comes in various colors, from light to dark. You only need to choose a porcelain powder that matches the color of the teeth, and when it is filled in, it will look the same as the natural teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 202) Can cement be used to fill teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Because cement is not very durable, it is only suitable for filling children's milk teeth and other temporary fillings.</p>
<p>(Question 203) Are there any other materials that can be used to fill teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: There are also gold inlays, alloy inlays (different from silver amalgam alloy), and porcelain inlays. These inlays are made by first making a wax model and then casting them. They are glued with cement when filling, which is firm and durable. These inlays are especially suitable for large cavities that cannot be filled well with silver amalgam or porcelain powder. Sometimes, to increase firmness, a gold crown is added. In addition, gold foil can be used to fill teeth, which is extremely durable. However, because it is expensive and the operation is very troublesome, it is generally not used.</p>

<p>(92) From Kidney Inflammation to Changes in the Fundus (Part 1)</p>
<p>Anatomically, there is something called the urinary system. It refers to the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Among them, the kidneys are the most important. Its shape is just like a broad bean. It is divided into the outer edge, inner edge, and front and back sides. The long diameter is almost vertical. The lower end is slightly outward. The surface is smooth and dark reddish-brown. Its location is in the deep part of the waist, located in the middle of the eleventh rib and the iliac crest, on the left and right sides of the vertebral column, the lumbar part of the diaphragm, and the lumbar muscles. The kidneys are a special organ that filters, absorbs, and excretes urine. It can transport urine to the bladder. The ureter is responsible for this function.</p>
<p>When it comes to how inflammation can occur in the kidneys, the range of its causes is very wide. Here, I will list them in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Infectious causes: This is the most common cause. It generally occurs during or after various infections. This is the so-called infectious acute nephritis. For example, scarlet fever, real typhoid fever, pneumonia, erysipelas, intestinal typhus, acute articular rheumatism, malaria, and syphilis, etc., can often occur.</p>
<p>Cold causes: Nephritis caused by this cause is called cold-induced acute nephritis</p>
<p>Traumatic causes: Nephritis caused by this cause is called traumatic acute nephritis</p>
<p>Dissemination causes: Generally, it is transmitted. It is called disseminated nephritis. It usually occurs when there is gonorrhea, cystitis, pyelonephritis, and perinephritis.</p>
<p>Toxic causes: It is caused by taking medicine and poisons, called toxic acute nephritis.</p>

<h3>All Countries Hoist White Flags of Truce</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Rome, 15th. Today is the day when all countries are to lift sanctions against Italy. Throughout Italy, flags were hoisted from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. to celebrate. Mussolini, wearing a white uniform, delivered a broadcast speech into the microphone during the lowering of the flag ceremony in the evening. His voice was clear and mixed with laughter! He said, "Today, July 15, is the day when countries around the world participated in sanctions against Italy. On this day, all countries are hoisting white flags of truce on the walls of their sanction lines. What we see here is not only a sign of surrender, but also a sign of the restoration of common sense." The Premier's clear voice, mixed with laughter, fully expressed the Premier's joyful and victorious expression, which made the listeners cheer wildly. The Premier also repeatedly appeared on the balcony to thank the crowds. The situation was very similar to when a top-notch performer in Shanghai finished singing a drum song and the audience unanimously shouted "One more!" as he entered the curtain.</p>
<p>Why is Mussolini so proud of the lifting of sanctions by various countries? Naturally he is proud. When Mussolini used troops against Abyssinia, countries around the world unanimously opposed it. The League of Nations resolved that Italy was an aggressor state, and also resolved and declared economic sanctions against Italy. In particular, the United Kingdom was even more fierce, gathering a fleet and concentrating it in the Mediterranean to show armed mediation, and there was a proposal to block the Suez Canal. At this time, Italy's situation was so serious, but as a result, it was threatened by Mussolini's empty voice, and the blockade policy was not realized. In September, he actually seized the territory of Abyssinia into the hands of Mussolini. Mussolini could not be happy and joyful for such a cause achieved by taking risks, facing difficulties, and enduring hardships?</p>
<p>Why did the League of Nations lift the sanctions against Italy? What a disappointing thing! The League of Nations also has its own unavoidable difficulties. Mussolini knows that what the League of Nations fears most is Germany. Since Germany rearmed, the United Kingdom and France know Germany's strength and cannot be controlled by any one country. Therefore, they advocated a collective security strategy to control Germany. Among collective security, Italy has a pivotal influence. Mussolini saw through this weakness of the League of Nations and shouted to lift the sanctions, so that Germany and Italy would cooperate, and he prepared to sacrifice himself while flexing his muscles. The League of Nations could not but fear this threat, because it was already difficult for the great powers to deal with Germany. If Italy and Germany formed an alliance, it would be like adding wings to a tiger, how could it be tolerated. France originally wanted Italy to help, and did not agree with the sanctions in the first place. At this point, the United Kingdom also had no way, and had to agree to lift the sanctions resolution of the League of Nations. How much face did the League of Nations lose in this matter, and how proud was Mussolini? It is right for him to boast, "All countries that sanctioned Italy around the world are hoisting white flags of truce on the walls of their sanction lines on this day."</p>
<p>The League of Nations' sanctions against Italy have been lifted, but can the collective security system achieve its purpose? The answer is no. If the sanctions against Italy are not lifted, the collective security system will inevitably collapse. Lifting the sanctions against Italy will cause the collective system to collapse even more. Why is this? Mussolini knows that the great powers' opinions are inconsistent and their interests are different, so there is no possibility of collective security. He also knows that the United Kingdom and France are already deeply old and have many considerations when encountering things. They have no courage. Even if there is collective security, it is difficult to get a strong front. It is better to join hands with the rapidly advancing Germany, so that the two heroes can stand side by side and reopen a new situation in Europe. In this way, not only can he do whatever he wants, but Italy's position can also be enhanced. Therefore, the League of Nations' lifting of sanctions may seem to have been fooled by Italy on the surface, but in fact, it has no choice but to do so. Mussolini also said, "What we see here is not only a sign of surrender, but a sign of the restoration of common sense." What is this common sense? It is just the four words "strength wins." I will wait and see how the European situation develops.</p>
<h3>Waterwheel (II)</h3>
<p>— Leon</p>
<p>She heard every word clearly, and didn't miss a single nasal sound he made. She had to pretend not to hear, but every word was like a thick, long iron nail, piercing straight into her chest. "Who would have the heart to have a child pump water? If Qing Sheng was still alive, would he let such a skinny child do such hard work... 'Little consumptive'... that name, that name..." She couldn't help but burst into tears at the thought.</p>
<p>The waterwheel was parked on the Eight Acres' Oxhide Harbor embankment. Under the searing sun, five back skins were hanging on the waterwheel lever, baking and scorching. Two were from the farmhands of Uncle Shougen's family, two were from the disfigured Shunfu brothers, and the other was that small, thin one with the bony spine showing. Wasn't that Mao Xiao's back skin? Two thin legs were following the other eight thick legs, stepping on the waterwheel axle's hammer.</p>
<p>The farmhands and the Shunfu brothers were all singing work songs. Mao Xiao couldn't sing along, but he couldn't say a word. All his strength was being used on his legs. His arms were leaning on the waterwheel lever, as hot as touching a branding iron. He felt like countless golden flies were flying in front of his eyes. Sweat was dripping from his eyelids, sweat was pooling in the waistband of his shorts, and he was constantly wary of being "eaten by the field" (his legs and ankles being hit by the waterwheel axle's hammer). Sometimes, the farmhands of Uncle Shougen's family would deliberately tease him, stepping as fast as they could. His feet couldn't keep up, so he had to hang there, neither up nor down. He would often cry out for his mother in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Your mom went to the Land God Temple to see the Taoist priest. You little consumptive!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, the farmhands would simply throw him into the harbor to drink his fill of water. Eventually, Mao Xiao was so scared that he didn't dare to shout, didn't dare to cry. He wiped his eyes and climbed onto the waterwheel, his face looking pitiful and wretched.</p>
<p>At noon, Shunfu's disfigured wife brought "tea to the field," and the female helpers of Uncle Shougen's family also brought it. But no one brought "tea to the field" for Mao Xiao. He wasn't even allowed to drink a sip of willow leaf tea from someone else's teapot. He had to hold some water that had been heated by the sun and drink it down. His intestines almost burned with heat. He got hungry easily, it was strange. He began to resent his mother, "You want me to work, but you don't give me anything to eat." He sat under the osmanthus tree next to the waterwheel and suddenly remembered his dad's death anniversary tomorrow. There would be rice, vermicelli soup, and fried tofu to eat.</p>
<p>Mao Xiao seemed to forget his temporary hunger. He looked forward to his mother bringing back a white fish from the street? (End)</p>

<h3>The Hook-Nosed Man</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Every morning, as the vegetable vendors came from distant towns, carrying baskets overflowing with produce to the market street, rain or shine, the hook-nosed man, never late nor early, dragging a tattered military uniform more than twice the size of his thin body, and wearing oversized leather shoes that his heels couldn't reach, would sing out-of-tune Beijing opera airs as he went to the He Xing teahouse.</p>
<p>It was the year of the war in the county seat that the hook-nosed man was conscripted to carry guns and ammunition, doing work like a prisoner. He stripped that oversized military uniform off a corpse and escaped. The hook-nosed man often boasted about this in the teahouse: Only I, the hook-nosed man, have such guts! Humph, that foreign devil's intestines were hanging out, and a bunch of flies were making a home on that thing, the smell was ten times worse than rotten salted fish, I'm not exaggerating, I flipped him over and stripped it right off, but the pants were torn, and the buttocks were stained with a big pile of blood, like a woman's… At this point, the hook-nosed man laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>Some in the teahouse clapped crisply, while others cheered like in a theater. This made the hook-nosed man even more carried away. He pressed his thumb against his bulbous, liquor-soaked nose, preparing to spin even more obscene lies. But the He Xing owner came out from behind the counter, darted behind the hook-nosed man, and twisted his nose, saying:</p>
<p>"Like a woman's what? Like a woman's what? Hook-nosed man, tell us!"</p>
<p>The laughter grew louder and louder. One by one, street vendors calling out their wares peeked in, knowing that the hook-nosed man stirred up some amusement every day at the teahouse. The He Xing owner was also a habitual antagonist of the hook-nosed man. So from morning to night, the He Xing teahouse was always packed with tea drinkers who came to pick their teeth and hear the news. The hook-nosed man didn't pay for tea, and even bothered the owner for three meals a day. Because the hook-nosed man could attract many tea drinkers, the owner's deliberate teasing of the hook-nosed man seemed like a mutual agreement. "Like a woman's what?" The hook-nosed man could have spun a long story from his mouth, but when the laughter of the crowd rose, he only pressed his thumb against his bulbous, liquor-soaked nose, pretending to be embarrassed, turned his neck, called out to the sesame cake vendor for two cakes, as if he had fulfilled his duty and should receive his due reward. But another voice from the corner of the room triggered even louder laughter.</p>
<p>"Hook-nosed man, is it like your woman's or not?"</p>
<p>The one who asked was the water carrier Ah Er, who knew that the hook-nosed man had encountered the "releasing the white dove" trick. When Ah Er publicly announced that comedy, the hook-nosed man had also gotten angry. His nose turned as red as a carrot. He grabbed Ah Er's thick arm, his thin body looking even more out of place in the oversized, tattered military uniform. Only his thin legs were seen bouncing up and down on the ground like a rat. Ah Er deliberately gathered his strength, stood up, and swung his arms in circles. Although the hook-nosed man tightly gripped Ah Er's arm, when the spinning became violent, he was finally thrown far away like an earthworm.</p>
<p>After a while, the hook-nosed man couldn't get up. Golden stars flashed before his eyes, his face turning from red to white. The hook-nosed man had that kind of fit once. He ran to the sesame cake stall, grabbed a knife for cutting noodles, and ran towards Ah Er. When the He Xing owner saw that someone was about to be killed, he picked up the hook-nosed man like a hawk picking up a chick, embraced him, and locked him in the small room at the back.</p>
<p>After this incident, there were even more jokes about the hook-nosed man. The hook-nosed man's reputation spread far and wide. People who came to the market street all wanted to have a pot of tea in the He Xing teahouse to meet that amusing character.</p>
<p>The hook-nosed man was already in his early thirties this year. He originally did petty trading and often came to the He Xing teahouse to do business. At that time, his bulbous nose already gave him a big advantage in business. The tea drinkers liked to joke with him, and his business became particularly good. The hook-nosed man slowly accumulated some money and wanted to get married. He secretly got cheated by bad people with the "releasing the white dove" trick. He thought the trick was very secret, but it was revealed by the water carrier Ah Er in the teahouse.</p>
<p>But the hook-nosed man never gave up on women. As soon as he accumulated some money, he went to some place to wander around, and gradually even lost the capital for doing business. So he dragged that tattered military uniform to the He Xing teahouse every day, sitting there, letting many people find jokes on his body, and deceiving the owner for three meals. Now he always deliberately talked about jokes about women, letting others pick up on the story of his wife's "releasing the white dove", earning a full house in the teahouse, making those tea drinkers happy. Like an item, he was insulted and ridiculed, being sold in the market street.</p>
<h3>Agitation</h3>
<p>— Xueye</p>
<p>—One of the Travel Notes</p>
<p>All around is a vast expanse of plains. Although the train's speed remains constant, it appears to be slower in sight. It is nearly dusk, yet the summer sunset, like a fiery disk, still radiates searing heat. The light reflected from the pools of water after the rain, through the neat rows of green seedlings, appears as if countless golden rays stand upright, spinning outside the window across the fields. At this moment, the plains are silent, with only the sound of the train wheels loudly playing a marching tune for the travelers.</p>
<p>Gradually, dusk approaches. The sun sinks below the horizon of the distant plains, and the reflected sunset glow still gleams in the western sky. However, dark thin clouds flying across the sky cast gray shadows upon the land. Inside the train cars, some passengers are already eating dinner, while others are busily packing their luggage, preparing to disembark at the next station. The train cars are noisy and turbulent.</p>
<p>A sharp and loud whistle shatters the stillness of the dusk plains, blaring wildly at the rear of the train. This sound, this piercing loudness, suppresses the voices within the long string of train cars. Even the sound of the rolling wheels seems to have become terrified and weakened. In the silence, people's faces reveal an inexplicable color of fear, and their hearts and breaths palpitate rapidly. A moment of silence, then the agitation begins again. Faces peer out of the train car windows, and the sound of the wheels stops simultaneously with the whistle.</p>
<p>A large group of people jumps out of the car behind the conductor's compartment, each wearing a panicked expression as they walk towards the rear of the train. A commotion also arises within the passenger cars, and groups of people leap out of each doorway. At this moment, the clamor of people fills the world of the plains.</p>
<p>After a ten-minute stop, a whistle blows, and the wheels begin to roll forward again. At the same time, each train car becomes noisy and clamorous.</p>
<p>"Luckily, he didn't fall to his death. If he had died, that would have been troublesome!"</p>
<p>"Even after falling, he could still walk! And he was carrying a large bundle of bedding, how dangerous!"</p>
<p>"I heard from people in the car that he jumped from the third to last car, so they saw it clearly."</p>
<p>"Judging from his appearance, he was extremely poor... it's pitiful to do such a dangerous thing."</p>
<p>Random snippets of conversation reach the ear. The journey is lonely, and the passengers continue to use the recent event as a topic for conversation and amusement.</p>
<p>Night arrives, and an even greater sense of loneliness invades the hearts of the travelers. At this moment, gazing at the black expanse of the plains, imagining the events of an hour ago, the heart, like the black night sky, is covered with a layer of black clouds.</p>
<p>—For lack of money, for fear of the conductor's scolding for not having a ticket, for survival, ultimately risking life in a dangerous act. This is life, this is the reality of today's society.</p>

<p>As the saying goes: 'When a blind man farts, the sighted can't get away in time.' It's like we ask a blind man to tell fortunes, the old blind man rambles on, but we have to follow it, which takes a lot of time. Therefore, a blind man's rambling cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>Here are four babbling blind women who are fantasizing about knowing the shape of an elephant. They have no other way to know the shape of the elephant except by touching it with their hands. These four blind women went to the elephant pen to touch the elephant. Before long, they all left with cheerful and beaming faces. The guardian asked, 'Have you all figured out the shape of the elephant?' Because the elephant is large, each blind man only touched a part of the elephant. A said, 'The elephant is originally like a cylinder.' B said, 'It's like a wall.' C said, 'It's a thick rope.' C and D said, 'It's a broom.' Therefore, the four argued endlessly. The guardian laughed and said, 'Go and touch it more carefully!' As a result, the four blind men seemed to wake up from a dream and said, 'It turns out that what A called a cylinder was only touching the elephant's leg, what B called a wall was only the elephant's belly, what C called a thick rope was the nose, and what D called a broom shape was only touching the elephant's tail.'</p>
<p>So, dear children: whenever we want to know something in detail, we must study it carefully, otherwise there will be no results. So we cannot touch a part and talk about the whole like blind men touching an elephant, otherwise we will never be able to understand the whole picture. Dear children:</p>
