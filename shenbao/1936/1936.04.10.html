<h3>李維諾夫　答覆全文</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）各報登載中國與蘇聯政府交換文件、李維諾夫答覆中國代辦吳南如之四月八日說帖宣稱、</p>
<p>「四月七日君奉貴國政府命令、授余說帖一份、另有一份、於同日遞交蘇聯駐華大使鮑格莫洛夫、說帖內容申述一九三六年三月十二日蘇聯與蒙古人民共和國政府簽草的事伴、據謂該約侵犯中國主權、且違反一九二四年五月三十一日之中蘇恊定、因此南京政府認爲可以提出抗議、</p>
<p>「茲爲答覆上述一切、余特聲明、蘇聯政府不同意於中國政府說帖中對蘇滿草的所作解釋、因此亦不能承認中政府之抗議爲有理由、</p>
<p>「無論簽訂草的事實、或草的各條、均未絲毫侵犯中國主權、蘇聯亦未向中國或蒙古人民共和國作何種土地要求、</p>
<p>「草約之簽訂、在形式上及事實上均不致使蘇聯與中國、及蘇聯與蒙古人民共和國間關係有所變更、此種關係久已存在、蘇聯簽訂互助草約、乃因鑒於一九二四年在北京所結中蘇協定、不致因此歪曲、且仍繼續有效、</p>
<p>「蘇聯政府茲特重行申明、上述恊定關於蘇聯部份、此後繼續發生效力、</p>
<p>「關於與中華民國各自治區域締結協定之形式權利問題、此可回顧一九二四年九月二十日蘇聯政府與東三省政府在瀋陽所訂協定、該的並未引起中華民國政府任何抗議、甚至中國政府且已承認上述瀋陽協定、與北京恊定俱有同等效力、</p>
<p>「同時且須注意、蘇蒙協定並不妨礙第三國之利益、因祇蘇聯或蒙古人民共和國成爲侵略犧牲、被迫保衛自己領土之際、始有效力、</p>
<p>「根據上述一切、蘇聯政府不得不認為中國政府抗議並無理由、同時表示深切保瞪、使中華民國政府確知蘇蒙草約並不違反北京恊定、且亦符合蒙古人民以至中國人民之利益」、（九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>「蘇蒙議定書」的透視</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>蘇聯和外蒙日前在庫倫簽訂了「蘇蒙議定書」。規定此後蘇聯或外蒙受第三國侵略時。締約國的一方應以各種援助給予被侵略者。我中央當局以蘇聯此種舉動。不但蔑視我國主權。而且違反民國十三年中俄解决懸案大綱協定的諾言。本月七日特向蘇聯政府提出抗議。乃昨日蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫的答覆。竟稱蘇聯此舉並未侵犯我國主權。並且說這議定書不但有利於外蒙。就是對中國也有益。雙方對於侵犯主權問題。見解正相反對。請就此點。從歷史關係上來檢討一番。</p>
<p>外蒙在我國北陲。東連遼黑。西接新疆。南界熱察綏寗。北和蘇聯西伯利亞接壤。不但是我國北方的屛藩。且是日蘇爭霸東亞所必爭的地方。日俄戰爭以前。舊俄因地理上的便利。首先南侵民國紀元前一八五年的恰克圖界約。就是南侵的開始。日俄戰爭以後。舊俄旣不得志於滿洲。便傾全力以侵外蒙。民國元年。慫恿外蒙脫離我國而獨立。翌年。更和日本締結第三次密約。分蒙古爲東西兩部。以東經一百十六度十十七分爲界。相互默認前者是日本發展的範圍。後者是帝俄發展的範圍。後來我國雖於民國三年五年。和舊俄締結中俄協約和中俄蒙協約。使舊俄在法津上承認外蒙是我國領土的一部份。但以國家多故。國防未固。徒靠條約的規定。終究不能阻止舊俄勢力的潛入。「十月革命」以後。蘇聯廢棄日俄密約。日本就嗾使白俄謝米諾夫侵佔庫倫派員煽惑蒙匪獨立。民國九年以後。盤踞庫倫的白俄。雖被蘇聯擊退。而我國在外蒙的宗主權却因民國十年和十二年的蒙俄協約和蒙俄密約而遭蘇聯的蹂躪了。民國十三年五月卅一日。中俄解决懸案大綱協定在北京簽字。其第五條一欵規定『蘇聯政府承認外蒙爲完全中華民國之一部份。及尊重在該領土內中國之主權。』從法理上看來。現在我國在外蒙的宗主權已經獲得了蘇聯的承認。可是事實。上蘇聯不但更加積極的以政治經濟的力量經營外蒙。且在我國欲行使主權於外蒙的時候。常常暗中阻撓。九一八後。日本向大陸進展不已。蘇僞邊境時起衝突。日蘇戰爭大有箭在弦上的趨勢。日本爲應付這未來的戰爭。不得不先在大興安嶺方面。從事布置。以謀進軍的便利。同時蘇聯方面亦以外蒙爲防日戰爭的要塞。不惜蔑視我國主權。擅和外蒙締約。以適應它本身的利益。「蘇蒙議定書」便是在日蘇兩國這種備戰的形勢下產生。</p>
<p>然而無論如何。一國對於他國的領主權。非加尊重不可。否則便是侵略。從前李維諾夫給侵略國下定義的時候。也作着這樣的解釋。蘇聯旣然承認外蒙是我國領土的一部份。自應尊重我國的主權。卽使它認爲事實上有所必要。而須和外蒙締結任何條約。也應直接和外蒙締約。此其侵犯我國主權。違背中俄解决懸案大綱協定的諾言自不待言。所以這種議定書。於理於法。我們都是不能予以承認的。</p>

<p>（日內瓦）法國外長佛蘭亭、曾於本日午後、與英國外相艾登會晤、幷面致機密照會一件、蓋以德國對於羅卡諾會議於三月十九日所制定之恊定、業已明白表示態度、羅卡諾公約各簽字國、自應有所决定、照會所載、係將法國對此之見解、詳細說明、提供英國研究云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）羅卡諾公約各簽字國代表、須俟比國內閣齊蘭總理抵此之後、始可認眞開始討論、法國外交部長佛蘭亭、昨日曾與英國外相艾登談話兩小時之久、當向艾登發出聲明、謂羅卡諾會議前於上月十九日所成立之恊定、德國旣已明白拒絕、則羅卡諾公約簽字各國所當與德國進行之談判、卽須予以中止、與英國對於法比兩國安全所發出之諾言、亦當付諸實施、此外佛蘭亭幷主張應由國聯會行政院提出建議案、藉以維護和平、而回復國際法治云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）佛蘭亭外長昨在日內瓦曾向英國外相艾登提出機密照會一件、小巴黎人報、頃加以評論云、「此項照會內容、雖極端秘密、但有可得而推知者、法國對於德國、已不信其有成立妥恊之願望、爰乃要求羅卡諾公的各簽字國、採取必要辦法、用以强迫德國自承謬誤、而有以補救之、此外德國擬在萊茵河區域、建造鋼骨水泥防禦工事、用以隔絕法國與中歐各同盟國、尤非法國所能容忍、羅卡諾公約其他各簽字國、若果無意援助法國、則法國自當保留自由行動之權、」事業報載稱、「佛蘭亭外長、當已向英國外相艾登聲明、一俟對德談判、認爲失敗之後、擬在經濟金融上採取相當手段」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法國和平方案　國聯並不歡迎</h3>
<p>認為徒唱高調英亦表示冷淡</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國在其答覆四月一日希特勒備忘錄文中提出之歐洲和平方案、日內瓦與柏林對之、大都不甚歡迎、日內瓦認此爲幻想的野心的、且爲莫可實施的、卽法人之在日內瓦者亦未有熱烈歡迎之表示、德人方面則指此爲人爲的、且缺乏誠意、並謂法國方案將過去十年中種種已喪失之原因悉數羅致之、柏林外部某要員語路透訪員、謂德國不欲立卽拒絕法國之對案、此項對案不過將種種意思編列之耳、並未有切實統素、而其建議多爲業已證明不能實踐者、祗將從前已經討論之計劃重行提出而已、至於法國所發德國已吾放棄其對於米美爾但澤等要求之問話、則吾人已有種種担任、世人可無庸自擾也云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國對德國備忘錄之覆文中所關全歐安全方案、今晨各報皆冷淡遇之、而從英政府重行努力集合各國、籌劃歐洲之解决辦法、每日電聞謂法國之建議、其一部分乃完全不能實行者、國際糾紛近今之經騐、已瞪明各國合編之警備軍與歐洲實在狀况相距極遠、法國覆文已使英政府不得不重覔談判之新途徑、在談判未開始前、將有歐洲和平之若干幻想、使人迷離恍惚云、每日導報謂目前急迫之問題、爲準備集體的努力之方法、便法德方案與其他各國或將供獻者合成一實際而可經衆接受的整個方案云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論謂法國各種建議是吾可見諸實施、殊堪疑問、歐洲尙未可謂爲已至可大規模、放棄其所要求的主權之成熟時期、但以整個言、法國建議乃精細遠大之計劃、未可以純粹破壞的批評應付之、但須與德國提議併合研究之、目前所急需者、在袪除種種障礙、庶可討論有秩序的和平之永久組織云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）晨郵報頃評論法國政府所提出之建設計劃、略謂「佛蘭亭外長、對於國聯會與集體安全、曁各項國際義務之神聖性、似仍抱有希望、但以最近事變而論、則此種希望、恐將成爲泡影、阿比西尼亞乃係國聯會會員國、盡人皆知之其主權與領土完整、雖由盟約加以保證、其命運如何、則在未定之天、神聖云乎哉、此外意軍所採作戰方法、聞已違反日內瓦公約、而使用毒瓦斯、神聖云乎哉、然則國聯會與其工具、尙不足以替代昔日之同盟制、而有以保障安全明矣」、晨郵報並謂「佛蘭亭外長之意、其在改善國聯會、此而非所能、則當予以結束歟」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報抨擊　法國式之和平</h3>
<p>備忘錄如高聳雲霄之大厦</p>
<p>（柏林）官方對於法國備忘錄、初本保守緘默、迨至今晨、各報始乃猛烈加以批評、此或由於希特勒元首發出訓令所致、亦未可知、德意志總彙報載稱、法國備忘錄、有如高聳雲霄之大厦、重在好高鶩遠之宣傳、「抑知法國人心目中之和平、實非德國人所謂和平、祗須略一瀏覽、卽知希特勒元首所提出之建議、簡單明瞭、而法國備忘錄、則結構空虛、純屬幻想耳」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法國備忘錄公佈之後、政府尙未加以研究、故官方幷未發表批評、元首希特勒、頃已離此赴巴維耶省員許德斯迦登城之別墅、作數日勾留、目前未與外交部有何接觸、至德國代表里本特洛浦、則現在倫敦、須至明日始可返國、中途尙擬在科崙城停留、此後是吾逕往貝許德斯迦登城覲見希特勒、抑由科崙城遄返柏林、則刻猶未悉、截至現在爲止、德國方面之評論法國備忘錄者、僅有日內瓦德國方面所發表之半官式文吿一件、其言曰、法國衆議院競選運動、正在進行之中、此項備忘錄、係爲競選而發、「其所謂建設計劃者、不過剿襲舊時成案、並未提出實際有益之建議、日內瓦人士、甚感失望」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>比國報紙　亦諷法國審愼　衆議院討論兵役案</h3>
<p>比京　多數報紙評論法國備忘錄、雖或措詞審愼、但多表同情、其書若曰、「法德兩國爭端、仍然存在、無可諱言、法國在法理上所處地位、自屬無懈可擊、德國究亦自詡爲合法、未知何以調處之、法國內閣總理薩勞、自始卽已採取堅决而又審愼之態度比國人均望其能以保持之、」天主敎機關報二十世紀報、對於法國、獨發表反對意見云、「萊茵河區城問題、若在此際重行提出、實乃冒昧之舉、此在比國視之、僅屬地方事件、至以吾人固有之常識、而論此項爭端、允宜局部解决、然後乃將一切不安原因、逐漸加以剷除、其事實較妥洽」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　衆議院昨日討論兵役制時、齊蘭總理曾發表宣言云、「余定於明日前往日內瓦參加國際談判、自當剴切說明、軍備競爭、實乃自取滅亡之道、此義各國均當知之、」按兵役制改革案、原係政府所提出、其內容乃要求衆議院以全　予政府、俾得自由决定入伍名額、幷延長兵役期限、業由衆院國防委員會表决通過、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西班牙　內閣辭職慰留</h3>
<p>五星期內選舉新總統</p>
<p>瑪德里　柴麋拉前總統辭職之後、亞查那總理曾向臨時總統巴里奧提出辭呈、當由巴里沃予以慰留、故巳打銷辭意、頃據消息靈通人士所稱、柴摩拉前總統、對於衆議院投票結果、原擬向憲法法庭提出聲訴、現已作罷、不日將携眷赴高陀伐省潑利哥城作寓公云、此際繼任總統者、究以何人最有希望、衆議負休憇室中、紛紛猜測、大槪最所推重者、自爲巴理沃、惟巴氏政友則謂、渠現任衆院議長、並爲統一共和黨領袖、在政治上地位極隆、且國務總理一席、捨現總理亞查那外、當以巴氏資望最符、故未必願膺元首之選云、政界人士以爲共和國民黨頭袖洛曼、或有繼任總統之望、渠雖未積極參加政治活動、但左派人民陣綫、卽彈劾柴摩拉者、則全體予以擁護云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>此項計劃乃以下開各項原則爲根據、</p>
<p>權利平等國際義務須加以尊重、法國政府以爲和平若果以各民族之需要與慾望爲轉移、則和平終不可期、</p>
<p>國際法治當有强制性質相當保障、</p>
<p>稱霸之事在所不許、法國政府以爲各國均得在某種情况之下、尤其是在軍備問題之下、自由放棄一部份主權、各國軍力苟有軒輊之處、幷得締結普遍的互助公約以補救之、</p>
<p>至在政治上所可採取之辦法、法國政府以爲歐洲大陸實乃組織集體安全制之標準區城、但歐洲全部、若果認爲過於遼闊、未便依據互助原則而成爲唯一單位、則將其劃分爲若干區域、從而成立若千區域公的、並在國聯會範圍之內、組織全歐洲委員會、扭任組織事宜、亦無不可、關於各國現行疆界之變更、須由關係各國互相同意、始可予以實行、但各國在二十五年之內不得要求變更現行疆界、此外關係各國、對於條約義務之履行、尤其是關於軍縮問題、務當商定適當辦法、或當包括軍事手段在內、關於此　、歐洲一般公約或區域公約各簽字國、均當指定陸軍空軍海軍部隊、撥歸國聯會與全歐洲委員會指揮、此項委員會並當監視各項條欵義務之履行、一俟互助制度組織完成、則切實縮减軍備之舉、卽可實現、全歐洲委員會討論軍縮問題時、祗須有三分之二之多數、卽可加以决定、歐洲現行與未來各項條約、並須提付該委員會備案、其有與歐洲一般公約或與區域公約相牴觸者、得由該委員會宣吿無效、</p>
<p>備忘錄嗣乃提出經濟建議案五項、以爲經濟改進首重維持和平、歐洲政治組織成立之後、自須進而着手經濟組織、其要如次、</p>
<p>歐洲各國之間、宜採用關稅優惠制、並互相訂立關稅條約、用以發展貿易、</p>
<p>簽訂國際恊定、或簽訂歐洲恊定、用以限制現行關稅保護政策、實行關稅休戰、並設立國際貿易法庭、藉以防任意廢止商務恊定、</p>
<p>在歐洲範圍之內、組織貨幣信用制度、</p>
<p>殖民地富源之分配、宜加以改正、俾歐洲各國均可獲得必要之原料、</p>
<p>上述各項辦法、當由全歐洲委員會特設股員會加以處理、並提付國際會議討論、此項會議不問國聯會會員國或非會員國、均當請其加入、</p>
<p>第二備忘錄至是乃提出結論云、此項和平計畫、與國聯會盟約不相牴觸、而相融合、國聯會所載各項原則、亦卽此項計畫所根據之最高法律云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法西主義的社會基礎（下）</h3>
<p>— Joseph　Barncs作　不忍譯</p>
<p>自然，他們是把法西主義看做眞的社會革命，看做使權力從一階級轉移至另一階級或轉移至國家的主義的。他們預料着中等階級在與大資本事業妥恊的初期有足够的力量與生氣。幻想着到某一時期國家觀念的發達會使這些事業全部收歸國有。法西主義的許多略帶神秘的外貌，以及它對於戰爭效能的注重，顯然爲的是造成矢忠於國的羣衆觀念。統治民族的最後的具體計畫，無論在意國或在德國都還沒有弄淸楚。法西主義和國社主義的輕視計畫與理論的坦白的機會主義，不免受到這樣的批評。</p>
<p>從社會主義者看來，這一切都是純粹的虛張聲勢。斯脫拉契在他的「資本主義危機的性質」中說道：「法西主義者自認爲以小資產階級爲基礎的獨立階級勢力。這一種全部概念是完全虛構的。實在說，法西主義永遠而且到處是一種工具，却不屬於利用大資本家做牠的無意的同盟者的小資產階級，而屬於利用小資產階級做傻子的大資本家」。</p>
<p>社會主幾者指示說：法西主義不曾在任何國家「握有」權力，它的權力是資本主幾在需要徽募烟動家與私人軍隊以維持他們瀕於崩壞的地位的時候所給予的。這見解就把法西主義看做財政的和產業的帝國主幾所利用的一種陰險的特殊工具。</p>
<p>在這關於法西主義的社會基礎的兩種極端的解釋之間，就沒有折衷的健全的解釋了。自由主幾與民主主義者也看不淸手段與目的的；他們先有了關於法西主義所播布的恐怖與迭克推多制的問題的成見，從而所產生的分析，無關於所包含的現實的恊力政治。因爲這不是神學的問題，也不是論理學的問題，只是引導文明人去行使或去接受某種政治行爲這一種運動問題，這一種社會經濟問題。</p>
<p>法西主義者自己對這問題也並不給以多大的　明。如他們自己所說，他們所注重的是演造歷史而不是寫述歷史。英國法西主義者—同時也是一個精明的歷史學者—愛冷氏只以不屑回答的口吻來對付史脫拉契的辯論，同時，他自己却提出一個關於法西主義的勃與的解釋。在最同情於法西主義的著作中，他的言詞可以說是典型之一。他說：「在危機的速度正在促醒人民的目前緊要關頭中，法西主義是對着兩種人同樣地呼籲的，一種是氣質上保守而精神上懷堅强的國家觀念的意志幼稚的中等階級，另一種是具革新的見解，會因左翼領袖不能實現他們的願望而失望與激怒的更少數更活動的個人」。</p>
<p>這話雖然模糊得很，却啟示了許多問題，必須解答這些問題然後可以猜測法西主義的生機與是否適於他國。在法西斯運動後面的熱情是否完全由揚整器與敬禮演習構成的？被棄的中等階級是否終於能够組織起來，獲得權力：雖然一百餘年來中等階級不曾在西歐社會扮演過統治階級的角色，但它是否巳把它的理想與它的價値傳播得那麽廣泛，至於獨占主義者仍夢想變成小資本家？</p>
<p>最後回答這些問題的該是法西主義本身罷。這要看它在給它投票的小市民與接濟它的銀行家和產業家之間怎樣的選擇，或者看它怎樣成功地逃避選擇。</p>
<p>尙未試騐法西主義的國家，是可以獲得比較迅速的回答的。這回答必須以比目前通行的更透澈的對於中等階級的硏究與分析爲基礎。這分析，第一，會把中等階級的歷史重新寫過，尤其在對於資本家階級和對於無產階級的關係方面。第二，會暴露中等階級的經濟力量的根源，會了解中等階級的生機怎樣學藉擴張着的商業的或地理的邊界。除非有了這樣的分析，即使法西主義的術語學也是不能作爲使人認識的可靠的工具的。</p>

<h3>蔡增基　談江輪改革事宜</h3>
<p>實行碼頭上售票及限制票額　整頓衛生設備改進貨客兩運</p>
<p>國營招商局、自經蔡增基担任總經理後、積極整頓、不遺餘力、新新社記者、昨晤蔡氏、據談該局改革江輪予客商之利益頗詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>江輪過去積弊</p>
<p>蔡氏談、本局自奉令改組以還、秉承交通部整頓計劃、依次施行、雖屬頭緒紛繁、難期一蹴奏效、然而分工合作、呆望計日成功、最近江輪改制、亦即整頓計劃之一端、查在昔江輪售票、不加限制、往往乘客超過艙位一二倍有奇、兼以散兵莠民、混雜其間、吸烟聚賭、亂狀畢呈、船上已無秩序可言、更焉遑顧及衛生、故積習相沿、各江輪對通艙乘客之待遇、幾等於非人生活、况每輪茶房少則六七十人、多則百三四十人、船工均不給工資、全賴私售舖位及索取酒資為服務之代價、統艙乘客購票登輸以後、須向茶房再購舖位、始有休息之所、即本有固定舖位之官房艙亦常藉詞有人預定、以為勒取小費之工具、至酒資一項、長途者常在票價三成以上、短程者竟與票價相等、公然訛索、恬不為怪、凡此種種汚點、悉為江輪所獨具、曾經趁搭江輪、匪不詳悉、本局忝屬國營航業機關、當茲厲行新生活運動之際、革故鼎新、不容瞻顧、</p>
<p>改革各項設施</p>
<p>茲將改制後各項設施及期望逐步實現者略述如下、一·實行碼頭上售票也、本局除仍委託殷實行號代理售票外、即目四月一日起、實行在各埠碼頭設　售票、未經售票者、一槪不准登輸、此後散兵莠民、無人溷跡、船上秩序、容易維持、以前之惡劣現象、可望逐漸廓清、且乘客到達碼頭、即可購票登輪、雖生外旅告、亦不致有無從問津之苦、史無須轉輾託人、致受意外捐失、二·限制票額不使濫載也、乘客超過艙位、必有一部分乘客、費同等票價、不能獲得同等待遇、且人數逾額、航行危險、關係尤鉅、茲經限制票額、進一步再將所有艙位編定號次、總以購得船票、即享有艙位為原則、客乘客不致擁擠、更可免購票後、不得艙位之虞、三·整頓船上衛生也、第一二兩項、實行以後、乘客當感安適、茲更從衛生設備、力謀整頓、並承新生活總會、派遺視察團員、駐輸指導、務收清潔整齊之效、此後於乘客健康、定有相當裨益、四·規定茶房薪工酒資、禁止婪索也、僱用茶房、不給工資、其流弊已如上述、故本局本勞工服務原則辦理凡在如江輪服務之茶役、一律月給相當工資、使個人生活、先告解决、至酒資一項、則聽從客便、雖經規定、以票價一成為標準、但少給變不得有所爭論、婪索更絕對不許、</p>
<p>期望各界合作</p>
<p>以上各點、為改制後進行事項之一斑、本局當必使之一一實行、並永遠維持、以表現國營航業之精神、稍盡服務社會之職責、惟是限制票額以後、與無限制票額者競爭營業、本局將受極大捐失、各輪業務人員、逢事務長以迄茶房、均改由本局發給薪工、則去支出增加、亦為自然之結果、是改制後、本局負擔極鉅、在政府為謀整頓航業、曁謀多數人之利益計、固不惜為鉅大之犧牲、然欲使政府整頓計劃、逐步實施、使國營航業、發揚光大、實有厚望於愛國人士之羣起劻助、共負其使命也、查他國航業公司營業之發達、雖屬管理得宜、然茍非得其本國各界人士合作扶助之力、曷克臻此、本局江輪改制實為改革業務之　矢、此後改進貨運、整頓棧房碼頭、必絡續努力進行、以　愛護本局者之期望、惟是本局旣已不惜鉅大捐失、進行改革、所願各界人士、本愛國熱忱、推愛本局對於貨客兩　、多所惠顧、俾本局業務、得以日臻發展、則目前縱稍有犧牲、亦冀收效將來、至本局一切措施、客有　於管見、思慮未週者、更望進而敎之、幸甚幸甚、</p>

<h3>上海之火腿販賣業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之廿一）二本市之火腿販賣商</p>
<p>本市經營火腿者，有蘭谿帮，丹陽帮，寗波帮，鎭江帮，徽州帮等之區別。金華蘭谿帮之腿商，雖爲數不多，但均係純粹經售火腿之商號：至若寗帮，鎭帮，徽帮等之商店，亦佔少數，佔數最多者爲丹陽帮計占全數百分之四五十。但丹陽帮大部均係出售凍肉之醃臘號而兼營大腿者，故不能爲純粹之腿商也。在九一八前，上海經售火腿之商號，共有二百餘家，今已遠不及此數，現在上海範圍較大之腿號，的八九家，前曾有九家聯合而自稱大同行，則該業並無大小同行之區別，惟此數家腿號，其範圍確比他家爲大。茲將名單列後，以供參考。</p>
<p>店名　地址　經理姓名</p>
<p>駿豐　河南路拋球塲　詹志良</p>
<p>豐　北福建路　婁仁壽</p>
<p>南萬有全　東門路　蔡際卿</p>
<p>北萬有全　南京路　董紹智</p>
<p>金蘭　南京路　關儒卿</p>
<p>同豐　東門路　汪五廷</p>
<p>茂生和　南京路　汪五廷</p>
<p>同生和　河南路　吳楚善</p>
<p>（註）同豐，茂生和，瑞生和三家係聯號。腿商同業，以前曾共同設有腿業公所，因南腿之產地爲金華，故其公所即附設於西門外金華會館內。自腿業公會成立後，公所名義，不復存在。現腿業公會，設在福州路公和里內，有書記常駐會中，管理一切會務。至於公會費，各家並不一律，大店每月交費二元，中店每月一元，小店每月六角。腿商資本，大小不一：如在產地自設莊口收買貨物，則非有十五萬元左右之資本不可；如係中等商號，則有三四萬元已足；若係醃臘而兼售火腿者，其範圍更小，有資本數千元已敷支配矣。</p>
<p>腿商營業，自民國十八年以後，日漸發達，各地銷路，亦殊興旺，若能繼續進展，則前途正無限量。不意九一八瀋案發生之後，繼以一二八之滬戰，上海市面，日漸衰落，各地銷路，又復呆滯，哈爾濱，遼寗等地，昔日素有大批銷數者，今已完全停止交易。去年五·六·七·八月，腿市為最衰落時期，上海北腿售價，每擔最小跌至二十四五元，較買進時之成本（每担的四十五六元）須虧蝕二十元一擔。今年稍有轉機，每担售價已漲至三十三四元（市秤），但產地因歷年虧蝕，產額已較前大减。南腿須存貯一二年後可以出售，去年上海售價，每担約四十元，今年稍回漲，約售四十六七元。聞腿商仍難獲利，或謂每担仍須虧蝕數元。　（完）</p>
<h3>上海人　春游的豪興</h3>
<p>前昨出發者一萬餘人游覽費估計四十萬元</p>
<p>（本報特寫）從今天起、到從今年起特別定了一個「下禮拜一（十三日）止、是掃墓節」的緣故、往年祇有耶穌復活節、便是上海所洋行中西職員出外旅行、謂外國淸明節Easter　Hol今年有了掃墓假、整批華idays的假期了、照往年　人的銀行職員、也携着如的經騐、在這個假期內、上花美眷、紛紛到火車站去、海許多中外人仕、必出外　回家掃墓、是爲人子者去旅行一番、可是今年的應盡的義務、何况又在淸游客、比較前幾年格外來明乍過不寒天氣的季節、得踴躍、這是因爲銀行業掃墓踏靑、有互相連帶的關係、眞是兩全其美、名正言順、不過除了銀行業外、其他各機關、均不給假、有墓難掃、爲人子者、於心安乎、</p>
<p>閒言休絮、記者爲調查此二日中出外旅行的人數、特地到旅行機關和交通機關去詢問、知道一個大槪的情形、第　先談旅行的地方、據說因為假期短促、跑遠路的很少、到杭州的最多、金華蘭溪次之、蘇州無錫又次之、黃山天目山再决之、到莫干山以外國人爲多、第　說人數、前幾天不算、單是前昨二天、到杭州去的有一萬餘人、金華蘭溪的五百人、蘇州約四百人、無錫的三百人黃山的一百人、天目山約八十人、莫干山約五十人、總共約一萬一千餘人、第　佔計費用、當然有錢的人、一家老幼到杭州去燒香、化上幾百元、不算一回事、現在我們平均計算、每人用三十五元、這一萬一千餘人的游覽用費、大約是四十萬元、</p>
<p>以上所說、是從火車去的、其以私人汽車沿滬杭公路開了去的人、究竟有多少、一時也無從調查、</p>
<p>至於水上旅行呢、有怡和公司所發起南京游覽團Nanking　Excursion　Trip、昨天晚上、已乘公和輪出發了、長江雖然是混黃的水、但緩緩經行、却也足以飽飫水色天光之趣、另外乘船到寗波去雪竇游覽的人、也不在少數、還有Sir.F.Lirth-Ross也組織一個旅行團到寗波、是乘新北京動身的、</p>
<p>記者又到北火車站去看看、熱鬧非常、廣塲上汽車成陣、大廳裏仕女如雲、月臺上更是一簇一簇的人、每一個人臉上浮着滿意的微笑、手裏拿了照相機和望遠鏡、婦女們穿着鮮艷的新裝、兒童們跳躍左右、眞是一派昇平氣象、雖然昨天的天氣有些嫩寒、但比前兩天低氣壓的熱悶、要爽朗得多、</p>
<p>興會最高的、莫過於杭州的旅館主人和小划子了、裏湖一帶的高等旅館、像西冷飯店·新新旅館·等、所有房間、早已預定一空、昨天下午、用長途電話向杭州定房間的、大有其人、均抱遲已不及之感、至於杭州的小划子、準定要刨黃瓜兒、搖船一天、非法幣四元不可、</p>
<p>上海人總是熱在、四十萬元的游覽費在三四天內就這樣的化完了、然而以風景馳譽世界的杭州市、却表示極度的歡忻、</p>

<h3>職業補習敎育的十種重要性（二）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>上面還是就靑年的父兄說的、再就靑年自身來說罷、小學畢業了、因爲家貧、不能升入中學、中學畢業了、因爲家貧、不能升入大學、無可奈何、只好入工廠商店去當學徒做工了、他眼看見一班同時畢業的同學、成績雖不如我、可是因爲他父兄有錢、可以享受升學的幸福、看到自己哩、只是沉淪在工商界做一個徒弟、或低級的職員啦、於是就越想趣不平、越不痛快、這不是社會上一種實在的情形麽、千萬不要看輕了這種情形啊、要知道靑年懣悶之氣、抑鬱之懷、影響於社會、實在是異常重大啊、如若有了職業補習敎育、這個問題、也可以解决了、一面做工、一面入學、並行不悖、便利得很啦、有小學畢業程度的、入初中相當的補校、有初中畢業程度的、入高中相當的補校、有高中畢業程度的、入專科相當的補校、儘可年限長一些、循序漸近、吿可以修完他所要修的學業、並且在這一種補校內學、比較入正式學校、做正式學生、還要能得着實惠、因爲他是爲需要而來學啊、那末、個人升學目的達了、職業知能、也特別增進了、同時職業的地位、也逐漸提高了、所有社會靑年懣悶不平之氣、也完全消滅了、請問、這樣敎育重要不重要呢、這是從不能升學的靑年心理上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>再就一般學生來說罷、中學畢業、不升學的有事做嗎、未必有、大學畢業、總應該得業罷、也未必、職業學校畢業、還不應該有事麽、還是未必、那末、畢業升學、又有什麽一定可貴呢、然則不入學校行麽、那却是也不行、究竟怎樣辦呢、我以爲最好的辦法、不如使靑年受過國民敎育後、即入職業界、到了職業界後、再入職業補習學校（這當然是指中等以上職業補習學校而言）比較合宜一些、當然、國民小學、是義務敎育、那是要普及的、不消說得、其餘如預備升學的初中高中、預備入職業界的職校、預備敎書的師範、如何設立、設的數目多寡、如何去學、入學的人數多寡、我們皆可以暫時不問、讓他另求合理的措施、我們現在則專來希望有大量的職業補習學校設立、以應一般小學畢業後巳入職業界靑年的需求、認靑年入了職業界、即應該來補校肄業、這不但是他的權利、並且是他的義務、我們要把一般社會觀念轉移過來、認定有了職業再入補校的靑年、是十分可貴、十分可敬、反之、入無聊大學、學不到本領、空戴一頂方角帽子的入，是未必有用、如此則職業補習敎育的價值就馬上增高起來了、這是就畢業學生出路上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>再說到敎育政策罷、試問、國家要辦敎育、是不是希望他能幫助改良社會、希望他能幫助改良社會產業、大學專科的科學敎育、應用科學敎育、固然是樹立改進產業之本、正式職業學校敎育、是養成多數改進產業的職工、可是、大學專科、數旣有限、就是入正式職業學校的人、又能有多少、我們却是希望這種帮助改進產業的敎育、眞能普及社會、大顯效能、那末、職業補習敎育、恐怕是再好沒有的一種利器了、因爲他能使整烟職業界的靑年和成人、人人皆得着適當的訓絲、使他們增加生產知能啊、試問、這一種敎育、應該不應該推廣、應該不應該定爲國家最要的敎育政策、這是從國家敎育政策上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>就敎育效用上說、固應認定職業補習敎育是十分重要、就是就改進全國產業、增加全國富力來敎、也不能不特別謀職業補習敎育的推廣、我們試想一想、一國有若十萬靑年和成人、白天在農塲工場商場做工、帮助國家社會生產、早上晚上去學習職　知能、使他生產工作效率裕外進步、格外提高、這一種效用多麽大、倘若不是這樣、則生產效率、從何增加、若是僅有高級技術人才、而沒有受過相當訓練的中級低級職工、以供其騙使、恐怕仍然是無用罷、於此便可證明出來職業補習敎育的價値和他的重要性了、這是從增加生產效能上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>再就職業敎育自身來說罷、職業敎育、原是以正式農工商職業學校爲正宗、可是、現在不然了、正式職業學校以外、還有職業補習學校、還有職業指導、可以說全部職業敎育的構成、以此三者為要素、竟如鼎的三足、缺一不可、因爲只有職業學校、絕不能使職業敎育普徧化、有了職業學校、再有職業補習學校、則職業敎育、乃可以言普及、這是一定而不可移之理、在正式職業學校、要有正式設備、正式學生、當然學生是他事不做、專來做學生、不要說今日的中國、職業學校、不能普設、就是在歐美、又何嘗能普設呢、况且職業學校畢業生出校有無職業可就、也還要看社會情形如何、若職業補習學校、所收的已在職業界做事之人、當然便利得多、不會發生這些問題了、這眞是可以補助正式職業學校效力之不足、可以使職業敎育的效力普徧於社會、這是從職業敎育自身效能上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>

<p>學校調查　上海英國學校槪况（一）胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海英國學校共有七所；公立者計有公共租界工部局立西童公學五所；私立者計有英僑設立男女英童學校各一所。工部局立五所西童公學對於公共租界內納稅西人子弟均可准其入學；是以校內一切訓敎設施雖以英國敎育原則爲主，但因同時顧到其他各國僑民之子弟，不能實施純粹英國式的敎育。而私立英童學校因入學學生均爲英僑子弟，且其組織與管理均由滬上英僑主持，是以校中一切設施均可代表純粹英國敎育的特性。本文先述私立英童男子學校概况；尙有私立英童女子學校概况容後另文介紹。本文承該校校長奎克牧師多方供給消息，並承惠贈該校簡况一冊，至爲感謝！</p>
<p>一，代表英國敎育的學校</p>
<p>私立英童男子學校原名The　Cathedral　Boys　School,Henry　Lester　Endowmeni直譯出來，就是雷司德遺產基金設立座堂男子學校。原來該校最初是由江西路二一九號聖三一　堂（編者按：座堂就是主敎駐在的禮拜堂）在一九零二年設立的；那時設立該校的目的是在招收座堂的唱詩班兒童。後來，入學兒童逐漸加多，該校乃成爲英童的學校。但是該校最初興建的校舍是不適合敎育理想的；因此英國鉅富商人雷司德氏在臨死時遺囑捐助該校一筆鉅欵重建新校舍。那時，聖三一座堂願意租地一方，供給該校興建校舍，於是該校乃有校地及經費來源。一九二九年九月，新校舍落成，學生人數增多，該校乃正式成爲英童男子學校。</p>
<p>該校設立的目的有兩點：第一點是在準備英僑兒童回國時可以進入本國的公立中學；第二點是在供給不回祖國的兒童在滬亦能享受類似英國公立中學的敎育。雷司德氏在其遺囑中規定該校學生必須是英國子民，年齡滿七歲以上，且係身家淸白者。該校編制有預科兩年，中學六年。預科等於我國高小，中學分初高兩級，初級兩年，高級四年。該校畢業生可參加英國建橋大學在滬舉行之入學考試；如考試及格則可直接免試升入英國各著名大學。該校在訓敎設施以及風氣各方面盡量設法與英國學校同化；所聘敎職員均係英國各大學畢業人材，　以實施此種英國式的敎育。</p>

<h3>紐約股票頗起起伏</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報吿、昨（八日）紐約股市、以商業報吿順利、一度曾創一九三一年以來之新高峯、後以週五係耶穌臨難紀念、休業一天、浮多獲利出籠、遂起鬆動、査促進市况上漲之因素、計　通用汽車公司今年第一季內共售出汽車五〇〇、一六七輛、為六年以來第一季之最高紀錄、　電力與鋼鐵世紀之報吿、橡皮與化學股價都步漲、飛機股自昨日跌後、今復回升、小交易所股票呆而參差、債市漲跌互見、其中美政府公債參差帶疲、全日成交一百六十五萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花　籌碼感枯　紗市邁步前進</h3>
<p>紗市續漲、趨勢良好、蓋以一般金業商曁公債商金融界一律拖進、且吸收大量包額、關閉不放、致市場籌碼殊感乾涸、裕康·大昌成·潤康一致買進、因之形勢堅挺、市盤乃邁步前進矣、</p>
<p>大昌成猛力拖進</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月跳高開拍、以場中新賣戶缺乏、檯面緊迫、市價徐徐上昇、但現紗交易不暢、客方購辦殊鮮、同業心思仍屬看疲、因之形勢和緩、二三盤時裕康·　豐·潤康·遠記等一致前來拖進、結果各月比上日收盤均漲六·八角至一元一·二·三角、午後開盤、市態平淡、因紗銷不起、二盤回挫、但入後大昌成忽來照市猛力購買、致市氣轉挺、結果各月上午收盤價均漲一·二·三角、査賣出者大孚一千七百包、通記七百五十包、裕大六百五十包、錦昌一千一百五十包、愼記一千四百包、元一六百五十包、長豐四百五十包、買進恒益一千二百包、裕康三千八百五十包、達記一千一百五十包、明德一千零五十包、合興一千一百五十包、　豐二千七百五十包、潤康二千二百五十包、大昌成六千零五十包、永大七百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷不滿五百包</p>
<p>現紗銷路依然沉悶、査到日各帮買去統計四百五十二包、售價堅定、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>棉花市氣愈緊　多空競爭劇烈</h3>
<p>棉市堅定、且漲氣殊烈、實錄外棉趨漲、各路產地存貨枯薄、市價亦漲、因之人心愈形鞏固、而銀行界與金業一意購進、市價尤挺、惟信誠大量拋出、多空兩方一齊加碼、成交量日增、將後之波浪、仍屬汹險也、</p>
<p>遠期花出六元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月續見高翔、形勢緊俏、場中新賣戶極形缺乏、且美棉堅定而五至九磅音、印棉停市、大阪三品花漲二、三、四角、裕康·潤康·長和·達記·　豐等努力收買、市場籌碼愈帶緊俏、惟信誠愼記獲利吐出、結果各月比上日將盤價均漲二·三角、午後開盤市價平庸、因通記晨進午出、信誠繼續拋空加碼、受其壓迫而回挫、二盤以後、大昌成突來猛力拉進一萬三千一百擔、長和裕康亦加碼、且自明日起、春假停市四日、一般穩健者皆軋直以避風險、遠月穿出六元關口、最高峯復達六元〇五分、迨至收盤時、多頭出籠遠月回小五分至一角半、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一角、遠月漲跌五分、査賣出者計信誠一萬一千三百担、源興昌三千担、生源二千三百担、永昌二千一百担、元一四千五百担、愼記四千五百担、恒德三千二百担、森康二千九百担、大孚五十担、通記六千四百担、裕大二千二百担、愼昌一七百担、買進大昌成一萬三千一百担、長和八千二百担、潤康九千八百担、　豐三千五百担、合興二千五百担、明德二千六百担、達記三千八百担、裕康八千八百担、恒益一千九百擔、一日間最高低價及將盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉到銷兩平</p>
<p>現棉消費平庸、各廠進胃呆滯、來源到姚花六百〇三包、通花七十六包、</p>
<h3>新陳美棉買戶活動</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、交易活動、各月漲四五磅音、晨初因利物浦消息良好、現貨堅昂、每週天氣報吿不利、市况向上、同業買進陳棉、經紀商及外商買進新棉、其後五月期及七月期有多頭了結、國內外略有獲差利者賣出、惟立為買戶吸收、中途以買進囤棉而在場中套賣、一部份發生反動、旋以同業及經紀商再度買進、又形堅定、據報棉商交四五月期借欵棉花、而求目下市價、惟為廠家拒絕、結果現貨漲六磅音、期貨漲六至九磅音、英棉現貨漲七點、期貨漲七至十三點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（八日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、九日七八月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百零一羅比半、較上日收盤漲二·五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花尚稱堅穩</h3>
<p>九日大阪電、三品期紗漲一角至一元二角、近月為一百九十四元六角、遠月為一百九十六元五角、期棉漲跌五分至二角、近月為六十三元五角、遠月為六十一元五角、</p>
<h3>實銷不振廠需停滯　漢口棉市平疲</h3>
<p>（漢口通信）本市棉花、狀况平疲、因實銷不振、廠需停滯、次貨積存、脫售不易、市價略低二·三角、但湖南第一紗廠等臨場購辦、去　轉健、全市成交折合市秤共計二千零十四市担又三十斤、產銷除監利為粗絨外、其餘均屬細絨、市價最高為宋埠產三十九元、最低藍和產三十七元三角、茲將售開情形分列於後、</p>
<h3>糧食　北帮吸收遠期粉　期麥昨先停市</h3>
<p>粉市昨預定今日起停市二天、須週一開拍、因此雙方了結均活、全日成交數又增至五十六萬包以上、惟遠期各月份因天氣不正、而國外市面繼續報漲二三角、業內外人心大都望好、北洋帮亦有遠期吸收十萬多包、祗本月份了結較多、故遠期各月份繼續步升、而本月份收價反見平落實、</p>
<p>麥市昨期麥因糧所停市三天、須到星期一重行開拍、期麥交易完全停頓、然人心亦在望好中、現麥廠胃不貪、貨主亦因欲求結束售出、故行情反見平平、昨廠去二千五百包、價五元三角二分至五元二角八分云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、早區迄未降雨、空頭補進、謠傳英國因存底稀薄、頗感不安、拆欵息輸入大宗加麥以厚存底、氣溫甚低、大體言之、屬於不利、</p>
<h3>薄稻大連帮進胃頗濃　本街銷塲亦稍見活動</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍稀、共到二十餘號、（貨共近五千石、）故人心較昂、本街銷塲稍見活動、形勢帶緊、市况見秀、厚　粳價升起角砠、薄稻包胃雖祗天津大連帮辦去一千四五百包、然略秀數分耳、杜洋尖帶高角許、陰變元亦鮮、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源卅四艘、市上白粳去路、高貨略有成交、中次績有去化、高檔定立、中次略轉緊勢、早稻定立、薄稻到銷兩平、市况平定、陰變元及各秈價形挺立、其餘各貨均無甚上落、</p>
<h3>客秈市勢殊形活潑　洋米赤穩定</h3>
<p>昨日客秈略有到頭、但本街去胃續旺、雖無客帮問津、而市氣頗見活潑、高次各擋一律堅定、後後市以產價高昂、貨主與囤戶心思均堅、故行情一時不易下落、昨日售開贛米三千餘包、溫台米一千七百八十二包、湘米一百包統為本街辦去、價與前市相似、洋米前有四貢一小批到中、但貨主均堅持不出、市勢亦屬穩定、昨由本街辦去小紋一百包、碎米三百包、厦門去洋糯米五十包、價與前市相近、</p>
<h3>油豆餅無一不漲</h3>
<p>油豆餅市况、前昨雖一度稍挫、但其漲風尚未稍衰、且連電續緊、汕厦內地等豆餅銷路復盛、統市計開貼現各牌廠餅四萬三千餘片、行情漲三四分、豆油做開期現各油六百八十件、行情漲五六角不等、花生油亦加起一二角、成交八百洋、故　油廠及內地車坊見市面不易轉　、黃豆交易頓見開展、計談成漯河豆一千六百餘包、四平街豆七車、范家屯大粒豆二車、行情均　起一角左右、杜豆沙黃南洋去路頗勁、交易各豆八百餘包、市漲近角、</p>
<h3>糖市號方糖貨開出略增</h3>
<p>昨糖市依然平定、公會劃盤、如二四粗砂白以及東赤白本廠綿白等、均原價無更動、交易寥寥、國產潮糖、昨以汕匯略縮、比前小去五元、稍現振色、號貨開出、汕頭綿白數十包、十八元二角、又枝洋百餘包、十三元六角半至十三元二角、又枝赤二百餘包、十二元七角至六角半、又半南靑百數十包、十八元、又普通京赤十一元四角、又次興化靑八元九角、共成交百數包、</p>
<h3>雜項三柰產價虛抬防跌</h3>
<p>三柰據汕頭訊、因採客爭辯、產價抬起二元許、加上一切外費、已超出申市三四元、漸成倒懸之局、但申市本以貨底軋缺、隨到隨　而漲、茲已銷胃已吿滿足、故後到三十件、迄已多日、尚無受手、反有轉疲之趨向、並聞汕頭有續到七十件、如申銷不動、則產價　必轉鬆云、</p>
<h3>五金花園鉛絲存底稀薄　前昨定出一萬四五千扎</h3>
<p>花園鈖絲近日市况、頗覺良好、市貨有不敷分配之勢、標準比前好起五六角之多、每扎行情已開高至三元八角半、異存貨甚為單薄、後購者頗多向隅之嘆、因之海外定貨營業、殊形繁盛、査前昨兩日、久孚巖井三井等洋行、均有做出、盯交數達一萬四五千扎之多云、</p>
<h3>東洋鉛絲到貨充斥</h3>
<p>東貨新鉛絲、近來三菱匯山大阪諸棧均有大批現貨裝到、是以本市流通貨殊為充斥、幸人心良好、市商賴以站住不跌也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　元芳羽綢小二三角</h3>
<p>昨為週四、元芳第二九八四次叫荘、陳列各貨計三十四箱、市形春銷雖發動、因逢西　復活節、當日出貨占多、價高略撳、泰西緞及元絨貢呢府綢四種上落微細、羽綢降二三角、洋紅藍布各見下墜、白洋紗及漂布當銷之際、價尚堅挺云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市亦將休息四天</h3>
<p>今日為耶穌復活節、海上西商循例休假四日、在十三號　將無國外交易、華商方面、通事及客商亦有假此機舍、返籍掃募、或作遠游者、故海上絲市、將因此而休息四天云、</p>
<h3>本年度　出口茶葉檢騐新辦法　（續）</h3>
<p>（四）我們談到著色茶　著色茶出口、本來應嚴加禁止、自從美國在一九一一年頒布著色茶禁止條例以後、因我　茶商的不加注意、於是日本茶就大景的能在美國推銷、法屬的非洲、在一九三二年、也有主張禁止有毒著色茶的進口、雖然該地政府、還沒實行、因為是土人所吃的茶葉、殖民地政府自然不願事業嚴厲執行、但也很有危險、最近法國政府積極在安南方面研究茶葉、就是明證、俄國是銷華茶最大的主顧、近年他們也以華茶著色之故、反夫購買日本茶做代替品了、實業部各商品檢騐局、以著色茶的歷史太久銷行太廣、徇茶商的請求、才定了個逐漸取締的辦法、對於著色茶的濃度、每年訂有三種顏色不同的最高標準、凡出口的著色茶、顏色與標準相同或更濃的、就禁止出口、這樣一年年的可以減少著色茶的濃度、又為顧全茶商選用無毒黃色色料的困難、曾派定職員、專門研究茶用無褚色料、在二十三年、發明改良無毒黃色色料八種、經過上海市洋荘茶業同業公會和上海市製茶業同業公會試用滿意並由製茶　同業公會出資設廠製造、改良色料、因為原料精、所以成本較大、售價不免較有毒色料為高、可是力量强、應用的分量較有毒色料為少、兩相比較、用改良色料、較有毒色料、還要經濟、祗因各地茶號工人、向來沒有用慣、所以在製造時候缺少了把握、從今年起、又新做了一種「十號黃」比以前的各種更進步了、前月並由本局邀集茶商、討論决定了幾個辦法、</p>
<p>甲、上海溫州及平水、規定每家至少一担、屯溪玉山、每家至少半担、婺源遂安、每家至少二十斤、除玉山由本局逕函該縣縣政府令各茶號購用外、其餘各處、由各茶棧分派各家、承銷試用、如試用尚有未甚滿意之處、可由各茶棧或茶號、逕函上海商品檢騐局、分別改進、</p>
<p>乙、各茶棧應負責分別督促各茶號購用、並由本局隨時派員、赴各地調査指導、</p>
<p>以後茶商、如再不用改良的顏料、一經騐出、就要受禁止出口的處分、著過顏色的茶、倘使不能出口、連內銷也就無人過問的、茶商的損失不是很大嗎、</p>
<p>（五）關於茶箱問題　為什麼要改革和取締不良的茶箱、又另有一本說明書、可以參看、此地不再多說、但是對於製造改良茶箱、還有兩點、應該特別注意、</p>
<p>一、茶箱鎖口處的四根三角木條、最好在鉛　放進後、再釘上去、每要的一端接笋處、如能做得略平、釘起來更能適合、否則也沒多大關係、</p>
<p>二、現在改良的茶箱、因為每條邊上、都有了三角形的木條、所以舊有的鉛罐、不容易很密貼地放進去、以後新做的鉛罐、應該改為弧形或圓形的邊緣、那樣才能夠把鉛罐和整個箱子密貼起來、不但沒有空隙、就是裝茶的數量、也不會減少、照我們計算、比較原來每箱的茶量、不過減少一斤、</p>
<p>此外各地茶商、倘有不明瞭或疑難的地方、不妨來函詢問、我們當竭誠予以答覆、（下略）（完）</p>

<h3>近代文學中的女性觀</h3>
<p>— 須沉</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>且看一看在世界近代文學之中，婦女的位置是如何地被描寫着的。</p>
<p>第一，要說到巴爾札克「從妹彼得」中的郁羅夫人。</p>
<p>如大家所知，「從妹彼得」，是描寫了所謂郁羅公爵那放蕩的貴族生活，被當時布爾喬亞新興勢力所壓，而逐漸減亡去的姿態的。那是描出貴族階級之滅亡和布爾喬亞階級之勃與——這種巴爾札克當時法國的階級社會的，歷史底的傑作。</p>
<p>恩格爾斯把巴爾札克這成功看作巴爾札克的寫實主義。誠然，巴爾札克因爲看消楚了當時的現實社會，所以具體的地描寫出了歷史的眞實。只是在巴爾札克那「寫實主義」之中出來的郁羅夫人是怎樣的呢？這個夫人，是被作爲毫無自己的意見，富於宗敎的熱情，不抵抗此世之醜惡而著望於來世的，那種現世的「聖女」似地描寫着的。巴爾札克是通過了他那種主觀——即把這樣的女性當作自已的理想女性而追求着——而描寫着的。</p>
<p>我們可以把巴爾札克的理想女性，放在郁羅夫人身上。也可以想像到道樣的女性，在那滅亡的法國貴族階級之中性中，是實在的。那麽，這恐怕就是作爲滅亡的貴族階級之象徵而向之哀悼的地描寫下來的女性吧。</p>
<p>描寫完整的典型而站在新興階級方面的巴爾札克，不但在他那新的革命性上，即在女性觀上，也以從各種現世之罪惡中淨罪的聖女——這一種舊的一時代前的封建主義之理想化作爲女性的要求的。所以，從郁羅夫人身上說，巴爾札克是並不曾看見新的女性，而也未能成爲那女性解放之將來的朋友。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>巴爾札克以後，自然主義全盛期的作家有左拉，弗羅培爾，莫泊桑等。左拉在「女優娜娜」中寫出了娜娜，弗羅培爾在「波華荔夫人」中寫出了波華荔；莫泊桑在「女的一生」中寫下了謝恩奴。把這些女性從其作品之歷史的評價抽出來看時則道些人，可以說並不是衹被作爲生物的半面而描寫着的。自然，人是生物；不把人作爲生物而描寫，就談不到描寫人的基礎的。但同時，人也是社會的動物。人類的歷史，是人從「作爲生物的自己」確立「作爲社會人的自己」的，努力的道程。</p>
<p>有人曾說過：『歷史者，是人在「人中的自然上走回到「人中的人」的努力』。這就是說：人把「人的」自然屬性（生物的本能）鍜錬爲「人中的人」（文化的，社會的性質；人聞性。）——這種努力，是人類社會之歷史的本質。因此，人的眞正恣態，是生物的要素和社會的。人間性的要素混合而成的一體。</p>
<p>所以作家描寫起人的恣態來，倘祇始終於那生物的側面，就沒有描寫到人間的半面，而也就是沒有看出人的社會關聯和生活發展。</p>
<p>自然主義文學的基本的意識形態，是止於「生物的人之發見」的唯物論。因而該時代的如上幾位作家，都並不以生物的人爲主。這與前時代的有人方法，巳可說是一個大大的革命了，但在現代（目前），却還是不够的。</p>
<p>理解了這點，再體味自然主義文學，就可以知道一個很好的敎訓：即如娜娜或謝恩奴的悲劇，是「人在生活上不追求人間的文化的東西」的這個悲劇。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在自然主義文學之中，只有在易卜生和般生的作品上，才有　　要求主張婦女的人間的權利恢復——戀愛結婚離婚自由等——這婦女解放思想放在作品中呼唱的傾向。易卜生的「傀儡家庭」和「海上夫人」，般生的「手套」等，是大家所熟知的。但在這些作品，只看得見婦女戀愛結婚自由等的革命主張；對於政治的經濟的自由，作者不曾想到。</p>
<p>這只要是知道娜拉，愛麗黛，斯淮淮等女人公的名字的人，都可明白。當時在歐洲，已經開始了對資本主義的人民的反抗——經濟的政治的解放之要求。從這見地上看，易卜生和般生的婦女解放思想就只是一種小布爾喬亞的革命思想。</p>
<p>德國有個批評家叫做埃侖脫的，曾這樣批評過。</p>
<p>總之，易卜生的思想，是對婦女無權利之一部的眞正發言；但對於「婦女眞正要有這樣的自由非先有經濟的政治的解放不可」這事，却仍然沒有明白。所以易卜生的戲劇，不久就從大衆失去魅力了。</p>
<p>說得明白點，就是：易卜生在作品中說了不能不給婦女以戀愛的自由和人格的自由，但這樣給法呢？像娜拉那樣即使給與了，走出到社會，但社會能保證那自由麽？如要保證，就得用什麽方法？……易卜生對於這些其次生出的間題沒有解答，所以結果是失去了婦女問題的重要性。</p>
<h3>沒有春天</h3>
<p>— 梅雨</p>
<p>沒有一朶首　花，</p>
<p>沒有一朶金鳳花。</p>
<p>像我們的往年，</p>
<p>一樣沒有春天！</p>
<p>一樣沒有春天——</p>
<p>在血戰的前綫，</p>
<p>在荒蕪的田野，</p>
<p>在震軋的機前，</p>
<p>在灰色大厦夾峙喧鬧的路邊，</p>
<p>失業的流浪者，</p>
<p>哀憐的賣笑者，</p>
<p>像無家的病犬，</p>
<p>在寒風里戰顫。</p>
<p>讓時代的英雄們，</p>
<p>挿上戰鬥的翅膀，</p>
<p>奪回我們的春天吧！</p>
<h3>漁人</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>（菲律濱，沒有季候的島。）</p>
<p>赤道上的國土是永遠生長在憂鬱里的，椰林中抖素着玫瑰花香的晚風，帶來了紓散的黃昏。</p>
<p>是三日，不見春天的季候。漁人西瑪丁老人，已從海濱帶着失望歸來。他那沉重的脚步聲，使我從倦怠的沉睡里甦醒了。輕輕的張開眼來，看見茅屋里已經抹着一層濃厚的灰暗，心暗地吃驚着：「見鬼！爲什麽剛一合眼天就黑了。」於是從木架上爬下來，邁開步跑出門去。</p>
<p>從海邊揚過了一陣帶着鹽濕味的腥風，使人禁不住要輕輕的打顫着，落日的餘輝也已經變成微弱的一抹了，浮在遠遠的水波紋上。</p>
<p>這時，里娜，一個漁村里美麗而憂鬱的少女，低着頭正沒入在深思里，輕步從對過的椰林里出來，牠底健碩的背影，悄然地帶來了一陣哀惋的歌聲</p>
<p>「……靑春好像是一朶美麗的花兒，姑娘！請莫負此，負此良宵……。」</p>
<p>接着是一陣尖亮的口哨和高亢的笑聲。然而這，對於我：一個年靑的漁人，是毫不相干的；於是便又信步，轉回屋里。茅屋已是頹坍不堪了，潮濕而又狹隘的。老人西瑪丁無言地坐在一把跛了脚的木凳上，正在默想着他寶貴的回憶：別離了三年而現在尙丟失在深山野林里的妻，兒，家屋和耕牛……</p>
<p>他有一個很大的願望：就是要在黎剎省的山野里，建立他理想中的巨屋和三頭體面的公牛。慫恿着他從老遠的故鄕。丟落了老婆兒子到這兒來的是它，而當在疲憊時，使他感到亢奮而高提起漁網的也是它；然而，普遍的不景氣，殖民地飢餓的橫流，撲燬了他底希望，而至於現在負起了債，麵包店里已經老早向他聲明過；不許再賒！想到這兒，這個憂鬱而又失望了的老人，便禁不住要悽然嘆息了，聲音是這麽地絕望而又感傷的。……</p>
<p>「你是一顆人們心底里的星，一盞美麗的明燈！……」低的歌聲又在暗的椰林里抖動了</p>
<p>西瑪丁老人，這時突然好像想起了什麽似的，抬起頭來，正想向門外大聲叫：「西寗！」却看見我正呆在他面前站着，於是便暴躁，而又滿含着斥責的口調：</p>
<p>「你發昏了，爲什麽這時還不上燈！」</p>
<p>「沒有椰油了！」我懶懶地答，兩眼還是死盯盯的向他瞧着</p>
<p>「那麽麵包呢！」他焦燥地喊着，可是聲調是多麽地顯得柔弱和無力啊。</p>
<p>「麵包店已老早說過，不肯賒賬了！……」</p>
<p>老人抬起頭望一望那滿溢住夜色的天空，又兀長的嘆息着，悲苦地把他那篷鬆的頭埋在枯瘦的手掌里便不聲不響了</p>
<p>滿月巳沉沉地浮動在那茫茫的海之邊沿，夜像無波的秋水般的柔靜着。……</p>
<p>幾聲充滿了熱力的笑聲，嵌在椰樹的葉尖又被輕輕的抖落了；一頭長毛狗便站在一個曠塲上，面對着海邊的月亮昂然叫吠，一會却又不知不覺的悄然不響。</p>
<p>這時從漁村的另一方面，正有人在用一種粗亢的高聲，在低低的唱着：</p>
<p>「……我們像是一羣無主的孤兒，從海角流到天邊，疲憊伴來了飢餓，飢餓……然而，有誰能來憐憫，賜與以可貴的麵包？……」</p>
<p>西瑪丁老人夢囈般的抬起頭，他感動了，輕輕聳着兩肩，低聲的對自己喃道：「……然而，有誰能來憐憫，賜與以可貴的麵包？……」默默的搖着頭，便又苦痛地啞默住了。</p>
<p>夜，寂靜着，不久整個漁村便在憂鬱里睡熟了。</p>
<h3>口夜</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>我是非常喜歡夜的，我覺得夜比白畫有風趣得多，白盡太嘈雜，而且一切的東西在日光之下太淸楚，絕不如在朦朧的月光之下，能引起人的依戀之情。無論讀書與作文，在白天都是不相宜的，因爲往往惦記着有許多事要作，心裏總是不能安寗，到了深夜一切都不能辦了，無論多麽要緊的事，也只好等着明天再辦，所以心是安靜的，撰文也好，讀書也好；出遊那是更不必說了，如果再有月亮，便較白天有風趣得多。有天在一個朋友家回來，已是深夜了，那時還是秋天，風更淸凉的，天空高朗的，月色是潔白如水，把這一條我時常經過的馬路，照得異常的幽美，以前絕沒有看見過這樣的景象，我眞沒有想到這一條馬路在白晝塵土飛揚，人聲喧鬧，車馬亂竄的討厭，到夜間會這樣淸靜幽美得令人如此愉快，因此我便領悟了夜是可以增人的情感的；如果一對戀人白晝在花園裏閒談我們便不覺得怎樣，可是他們要月夜在花園裏閒談，我們立刻覺得有一種美感，彷彿讀了一句纏綿詩似的；夜中的簫聲，要比白畫感人之力爲深；在白晝我們如果聽見一個寡婦的啼聲，並不覺得這樣，可是在深夜便不同了，她的悲哀的音波，完全貫入我們的耳中，立刻我們也悲哀起來。夜因爲淸靜的綠故，所以一切的聲音都很能動人：如打更的梆子聲，隣家的鐘聲，賣蘿蔔的光細的喊聲，遠處的犬吠聲，都像經過擴音機把音波放大了似的，使人聽着絕不能以爲這是很平凡的音聲，立刻便有一種反應，像讀完一首凄凉的詩，或是看了一幅幽美的畫似的，那種感覺</p>
<p>我對於詩也有喜歡讀描寫夜景的，什麽「犬吠」山秋意靜，敲門時有夜歸僧」。什麽：「夢覺疎鐘嗚遠寺，一池明月芰荷香」。都使感覺幽靜的美。古的人散文，專寫夜景的還很少，我讀過的只有王維和秦少遊二人的兩小段，現將牠錄在下面：</p>
<p>「北陟玄壩，淸月映郭，夜登華子岡，輞水淪漣，與月上下，寒山遠火，明滅林外，深巷寒犬，吠聲如豹，村墟夜春，復與疎鐘相聞。」</p>
<p>——王維。</p>
<p>「元豐二年，中秋後一日，天宇開霽，林間月明，可數毫髮，自普寗凡經佛寺十五，皆寂不聞人聲，道旁廬舍，或燈火隱顯，草木深鬱，流水止激悲鳴，殆非人間之境。」！</p>
<p>——秦觀。</p>
<p>這兩段小品寫得都很好。我覺得夜不僅是有風趣的，同時也可以增人的文思的，我們在疲倦了之後，燃上一枝烟，細細的凝思着要寫的文句，絕沒有人來擾亂，只聽着筆劃在紙上的聲音，這是多麽有意味的事！中外許多的名作家，都是被夜的帮助才完成了他們的傑作的吧？</p>
<h3>作家和言語</h3>
<p>— 鄭伯奇</p>
<p>文學是言語的藝術，作家應該是言語的技師——固然不必一定要做言語的魔術師。作家和言語有不能須臾分離的宿命。</p>
<p>作家不一定是雄辯家。事實上，有許多文章寫得好的人反而不會說話。但，要寫好文章，對於言語非有十分理解，十分運用的力量不可。驅使言語的力量，雖不是作家的能力的全部，然如這却是必要不可缺的部分。</p>
<p>用怎樣的言語才可以適當地表示客覜的某一形象，用怎樣的言語才可以適當地表現主觀的某一種情感，這是作家最緊要的工作。法國大小說家佛祿貝爾嚴格訓練莫泊桑的，就是這一點。</p>
<p>本來，作家對於言語是很敏感的。一出娘胎，他所聽到的，所使用的，就是他寫作時所用的工具。論理，這樣的言語，他去理解，去運用，比較應該容易。可是事實上，並不是那麽一回事。言語，是作家很難征服的一個對象</p>
<p>若是作家所用的言語，並不是有生以來他所常用的那種話，而是別個地方，或者別種社會所有的言語，那就更難了。</p>
<p>不必用外國語來作例，單就中國來說罷：叫廣東人寫上海語的對白，叫黃包車夫寫大學敎授的議論，無論怎樣，都是不大可能的。</p>
<p>現在中國作家的一個大困難也就在這種。中國現在還沒有一定的標準語，即使有所謂「普通語一，但這也並不是每個人從小就用過的活生生的語言，因此，一個人寫作的時候，對於他所最要緊的工具先感到困難了。在這裹，我們不能不羨慕老舍先生。他能够完全用自己日常所講的話來寫作是値得算一件幸福的事。</p>
<p>有許多靑年在模倣老舍先生用北平話來寫東西，可是他除道亂用您，亂用咱們，亂用幹嗎，亂在語尾上加兒字以外，一點北平話的味兒都沒有，這倒反引起讀者的不快。</p>
<p>林琴南反對白話文，曾說過：「吾恐浙江安徽之白話固不如直隸之佳也。」這倒有點給他說着了。別種語系出身的作者，比起北方語系的作者，在言語方面，的確吃虧不少。</p>
<p>文言文的復興，語錄體的流行，雖然另有社會背景存在，但言語的困難也不失爲一個重要的原因。</p>
<p>征服言語，確爲中國現代的作者困難的工作</p>
<h3>馬路牌出品</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>一連下了三天雨，王老頭子躱在家裹閑着，不能出去作生意。說來道已是隆冬時分，却還下着連雨，這事情是北方地帶所沒有的，反之，倒要常常下些雪。今天好容易晴了天，他喜出望外，迎着太陽趕忙把他那套生產工具帶到老地方擺設出來他的灘子；灘址在一個十字路口旁邊，地方雖然算不得怎樣熱鬧，來往人等和車輛也不算少。　冬之晨風帶着寒氣順着馬路蕩漾着，把那些深藏在牆角中的霉濕氣味揚起來了，但馬路上却完全乾了，若是有一個陌生人來了時，哪裏會相信這是一條經過了三天連雨洗刷的馬路呢，這却不能不歸功於外國人鋪設的油漆馬路的善政了。這時，烘山芋的，提籃子賣大餅油條的，還有稀飯擔子全搶了先抖擻開深沉的睡意，在馬路上營業起來，豆漿灘緊靠着賣粢飯的也擺設出來，朝空中冒着一團團的熱氣，——一種叫人們在冬天早晨歡喜的熱氣。</p>
<p>這正是上下工的時候，男女人成羣結隊地走着，不一會工夫，分別把脚步停在各個不同的吃食灘的近旁，用着早點，黃包車夫趁無人呼喊時，也停下車子大口地喝着稀飯，呼嚕呼噜地喝得很忙迫，似乎怕多費時間有人喊車時失了生意。王老頭子的生意也來了，幾個面孔熟悉的主顧，見面先問：</p>
<p>「怎麽這二天沒有出來作生意？」</p>
<p>緊接着似乎想起來道三天是落雨的，自然無法擺灘子作生意，於是趕忙又說道：</p>
<p>「可是因爲落雨麽？倒忘記了這一回事情」。</p>
<p>他們有的掏出四個銅板，還有人掏出八個，買去一兩盒「馬路牌」香烟。烟盒子式樣很多，中國的「公司牌」「金鼠牌」「白金龍」「小美麗」「紅金龍」「聯珠牌」不但樣樣有，就連外國烟「五華牌」「發達爾」「克雷斯」也全有的，冷眼看去這些烟盒很耀眼，但這只是烟盒不同而巳，內中的烟絲却全是一樣的。人們都管這一種香烟叫「馬路牌」，就因爲是在馬路上製造出來的。王老頭子現在正運用他的小機器趕製出品呢——這「馬路牌」出品。</p>
<p>在一個方斜小板箱的斜面中間地方，削出一條橫縫，縫子裏捲藏一條長的牛皮紙，紙上捲着一根木棍，把香烟紙塗好漿糊平放在橫縫下面，放烟絲在橫縫紙兜裏，然後把木棍朝前一轉，等放回手時，那新的出品——一枝香烟便露出來，一待剪齊了香烟的兩端，全部工作便吿完成。</p>
<p>王老頭子作得很熱，不一會就作好了一大堆</p>
<p>「王老頭子，來一包」。</p>
<p>坐在黃包車底座上剛剛喝完稀飯的趙阿金大聲喊道。王老頭子很順從地遞過去一包，兩眼直釘釘地望着他的主顧出神，他在等待着某種東西。</p>
<p>趙阿金抽着一枝香烟，想起他還未付錢，就說道：</p>
<p>「王老頭子，明天把你錢。」</p>
<p>錢，四個銅板，正是王老頭子所等待拿到手的，明天把錢，他不同意，雖然這也是位老主顧，照理說一定欠不過明天，他却願意收進現錢。他沒有答應，呆着一會，却笑嘻嘻地說道</p>
<p>「這個，哈哈，這個……」</p>
<p>「行啦！」那一個拋過四個銅板，叫道，「不够交情，白照顧你這些天。早把晚不把，說起來還不是一個樣！你怕我逃跑了不成？哼，才四個銅板的事情。」</p>
<p>拿到四個銅板之後，王老頭子的話語可多起來：</p>
<p>「哪裏的話，老主顧啦，眞是沒有一點關係，還有不行的麽？我跟你說着玩玩就是啦。你生氣麽？那你可不對，是你太多心，你油罷，錢不錢的是小事，有錢無錢全不能叫你空着嘴。」</p>
<p>若說「人老奸，馬老滑」的話，那把這話加在王老頭子的身上是不算過分的，他眞够奸滑，一方面收到了現錢，一方面還把別人敎訓了一大頓；不，這話不該這樣說，王老頭子不願意賒欠也有他的苦衷，實在這年頭無論大小生意全很難作，進現欵，手頭裏比較活便一些。趙阿金本是個氣粗的渶子，把王老頭子的歹話當成好話聽，反倒不安地說他也不過只是講着遊戲話，請求王老頭子切莫多心。王老頭子自不會多心的，生意作到手比什麽都好。他也未再答言，下頭又繼續製造着「馬路牌」出品。</p>
<p>王老頭子不僅製造「馬路牌」香烟，他自已還抽呢，這一點，和一般工人製出貨品自己不能享用的情形又大不相同。現在，他停下手裏的工作，揀出一枝捲得比較壞的香烟抽着，趁這時他在休息。</p>
<p>不要看輕這「馬路牌」小手工業，未從開工也要拿出些本錢。先說香烟紙，一千張就要四角大洋，烟絲一塊錢買四斤，再加上香烟盒子，雖然十文錢可以買十只，不算貴，聚少成多究竟也要開銷一些，再算進那架小機器，一出貨，頂少也要兩三塊錢才行。</p>
<p>王老頭子本不是作這生意的，他原在一家外國人家作打掃院子收拾花圃的工作，就是外國人所說的苦力，這家作到那家，一連作了八九年，現在因爲上了年紀就被歇了，誰高興化錢僱用年邁力衰的老頭子！下事之後，他聽從一個朋友的主意作了這門生意。不作這生意，閑着他閑不起，他是個活人，不能不吃，閑下去就要餓死的。</p>
<p>這「馬路牌」香烟他本來買五個銅板一包，後來怎樣也賣不上那個價錢，只能賣四個銅板一包了，因爲他的主顧不是工人就是黃包車夫，誰都沒有多餘的錢，誰都不能不計較一個銅板的。還有一個使他跌價的原因，那是因爲他的同行一天比一天加多，人家賣的多是四銅板一包，他自不能不跌價。這也不賠錢，一塊錢四斤的烟絲正該賣這樣價錢；但他却知道別人一包四銅板的貨色，實在是一塊錢五斤的烟絲，照理應該賣三個半銅板一包，現在他們賣四個銅板，已經比他賺多了。幸而抽烟的人們還都有一種鑑別貨色好壞的能力，他們旣經比較出別家貨色的差劣，自然就樂於購買他的香烟，因而他的生意還不退板。</p>
<p>太陽抬高了頭，街上熱鬧起來，管理交通燈的印度阿三上了班，大姐，娘姨提着籃子到小菜場去買菜，汽車跑得連成了一串，天氣也漸覺暖和一些了。</p>
<p>兩個拾拉圾的孩子，帶着兩副骯髒的面孔，從遠處奔過來，站到王老頭子的面前，呼呼喘喘放下身後的破筐，每人檢出一大堆空空的香烟盒。王老頭子恰好抽完他的一枝香烟，就向那大孩子問道：</p>
<p>「小二子，你拾到多少隻盒子？」</p>
<p>接着，打一個呵欠，又向另外那一個：</p>
<p>「你呢，小三子，你今天帶來幾隻？」</p>
<p>小二子那一堆十七隻，小三子那一堆十四只，一共三十一隻空盒，小二子合一塊又數一遍沒有錯，便答道：</p>
<p>「一共三十一隻，該要——該要三十一文錢」</p>
<p>「三十一文錢，錯是不錯，可是你們看看裏面的貨色，不是有好多隻齷齪的麽。」王老頭子說完揀出兩隻破盒子給他們看。「你們看看，這樣的盒子也能用麽？也好費錢麽？」</p>
<p>兩個孩子全楞住了，王老頭子不買，他們就換不到銅板，對於銅板，他們是何等需要啊！過一會，小二子揣着一副恐懼的心情怯怯地朝王老頭子問道：</p>
<p>「依你，——依你呢？你怎樣說？你——你不要麽？」</p>
<p>「怎能不要呢。」王老頭子計上心來。「這麽辦罷，算我吃點虧，好壞都留下，兩下方便，給你們二十五文錢，有六七個盒子不能用，不算數。拿去這三十文錢，」他遞給大孩子，「下欠五文錢下回再算罷。若是別人，萬萬不要買你們這樣壞盒子的。知道麽？」</p>
<p>兩個孩子連聲應諾，拿着銅板欣然走去，一邊走着，一邊在計議着化用到什麽地方，怎樣化用。……</p>
<p>王老頭子很懂得作生意的法門；想賺錢，處處要取巧。現在他把那幾個聲說不能用的空盒倒儘先用上了，他爲自己道種剝削勞力的妙事歡笑着。</p>
<p>「王老頭子，你這向生意可好吧？」</p>
<p>猛然聽到這聲沉重的問話，王老頭子先楞了一會，隨後就猜到來人是那一位。一點沒有猜錯，正是第一天領他來此作生意佔地盤的那位大好老，沒有他帮忙，他這生意是作不成的，飲水思源，應謝盛情。王老頭子趕忙站起身，遞過去一包香烟，這就是他表答謝意的一點小心思，他不吝惜這點消費。他陪笑說：</p>
<p>「先生，託福生意還好，抽一包嘗嘗。你老今天怎麽這樣得閑？近些日未見你老一面，一定太忙吧？」</p>
<p>六先生是抽「白金龍」的，不要他的「馬路牌」，這一來，倒把王老頭子弄得不知怎樣是好了。面對着他的恩人他却不能報點恩情，他的心裏還會安然的麽。在和恩人講話時，他非常留神，若是有一句話不當心，說走了嘴，得罪了六先生，那他的生意恐怕就難得作成。所以王老頭子每句話說得都是萬分小心的比起剛剛和趙阿金小二子說話的神情大不相同。</p>
<p>六先生已然走過去了，王老頭子香烟雖然沒有送出去，却知道並沒有得罪恩人，至於恩人不同他多打招呼，那因爲人家的工夫寳貴，又兼是個有身分的人，論情理也不會多同他攀談的。</p>
<p>他坐下身子，又開始工作，香烟一枝枝被捲出來。</p>
<p>左近地方有人在喊他了：</p>
<p>「王老頭子，再來一包香烟。」</p>
<p>王老頭子停下手，把一包香烟送到主顧的手裏去，收到錢，剛好回到老地方，又聽到有人喊他了：</p>
<p>「王老頭子，再來一包香烟。」</p>
<p>今天王老頭子的生意眞不錯，他樂得很，肚子裏餓了，望望身後烘得正熟的山竽灘，止不住喊道：</p>
<p>「喂！來一只山竽」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>讀「人口問題與節制生育」</h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>繼山額夫人之後，馬丁夫人又到了上海，並且，在昨天公開演講了一次：「人口問題與節制生育」。</p>
<p>據報上的演講辭，這一次演講的意義，可歸納爲下面幾句話：「無論何國，如不能予人民以生活上之安適，卽應提倡節制生育，提倡生育者，實應視生產者之能力而定」。</p>
<p>馬丁夫人是看到了「當此社會制度未改革前，正有千萬兒童，宛轉呻吟於苦痛之饑寒生活中」的，他看到了「英國現有二百萬人失業」者中，「其子女卽鮮有受敎育之機會」，所以主張「須共父母有工作後，始再生產」。</p>
<p>「其父母有工作後」，其子女者是否卽有「受敎育之機會」？這是疑問的，以我國的情形來說，無產者的獨養子連衣食都不週者，眞是遍地皆是；再退一步來說，「其父母有工作後」，孩子是生了，其父母者又失業了又怎樣呢？再以我國的情形來說，因爲外來的及內在的種種原因，中上之家的沒落在近年來是非常之多的；依此看來，我們豈僅「節育」而已，簡直是該消滅生育了。</p>
<p>再以依「吾人之經濟情形，可生產撫養若干子女，卽生產若干」來說，好像惟有富翁的子女們纔能成爲優良一份子了，事實上是怎樣呢？遠的不必說，就以當天的報來做例子罷，就有一位富商之子的「桃色破產」案，可見富翁之子也不一定是「優良」份子的。</p>
<p>人是由生活環境來决定的，「有花園而無兒童」，和「有兒童而無花園」，也正是這社會制度所造成的最好的說明，因爲有「千萬兒童」的「宛轉呻吟於苦痛之饑寒生活中」，便不要「千萬兒童」，那是多麽可笑的刻舟求劍的辦法呀！</p>
<p>最後，馬丁夫人還以英國和印度的嬰孩死亡率來作比較，說是「兩地均有公民敎育，現在英國生活程度提高，生活快樂，印度反是，不同者，英人能節育，印度則否」。好像印度的所以「反是」者，完全是因爲不節育所致的。</p>
<p>殖民地的印度的貧困，果然是爲不節育所致嗎？在一切待遇上，他和「同一政府統治」的英國是同樣的嗎？這個，我想祇要稍稍留意于世界近况，是不難回答出來的。這種替帝國主義作傳聲筒的飾辯，我們應該把它揭穿開來。</p>
<p>就以「生活程度提高，生活快樂」的英國來說說不是也有「二百萬」的失業羣，及其「鮮有受敎育機會」的子女們嗎？「生活快樂」究竟是指些什麽呢？他們是和殖民地的奴隸們享受着同樣的命運的。</p>
<p>改良主義或人道主義他的動機或許是無可厚非的，然而在客觀效果上，它往往成爲麻醉大衆的工具，使得大衆有所徘徊觀望，而結果却依舊使大衆成爲俎上之肉。</p>
<p>節制生育論者正和其他的改良主義者同樣，它所做的，祇是問社會讓步而不是問社會抗爭，因之他的效果亦祇是使大衆引頸候戳！何况，在節育的烟幕下，還暗藏着替帝國主義者的說敎意味呢。</p>
<h3>小女人</h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>這個小女人就是砲兵第三營上等兵幼三的老婆，一個身材瘦削，神精恬靜溫和而且誠摯的年靑小女人。一個陌生人，一個外來的客商，絕不會相信她已經是一婦人，而且是一個已有一個六歲女兒的婦人了。</p>
<p>當幼三爲着村里頓不住，馱着包袱要去投軍時，曾吿訴她道：「好好兒的看顧孩子吧，我想只要是順手能够撈點兒什麽的，不過一兩年我便會回來」！他溫和的笑着，可是却是笑的那麽悽慘，悲傷，踏開步在槐樹下一燜便消失了，永遠消失了。然而，這却已是三年前的事了。</p>
<p>幼三已經投軍去了，家里缺乏了脚手，同時又請不起人工，她只得把家里那畝半薄田押給一個鄰鄕的親戚，借點錢在家里那所倒還寬曠的草房里，排着幾條桌檯，架起坑床，開起小酒店和十二支牌（註：一種賭具）塲。</p>
<p>這生意馬上便興隆起來了，農民們瘋狂似的從村里底每家破茅舍每個小角落溜了出來，又很快地匯擠在她底草房里，大聲吆喝，喊嚷。因爲着醉，酒盃便灌到鼻孔里去。父親和孩子，爲着三句半話互不中聽而扭打起來。賭徒們則在兩三個小銀輸贏不淸，而互用拳頭敲擊胸膛。直到我們底店主婦，從她底臟汚的櫃台上跑下，溫和地說道：</p>
<p>「諸位這是吵的多麽可怕，多麽可怕的啊！簡直就和集里一樣……」</p>
<p>於是乎爭鬧平息。人們回復了他必要的坐位，理性的談論，爭辯，又復充溢了這狹隘的塲所。</p>
<p>這個小女人，有時自己也喝醉的，爲着成羣的年靑農民向她這麽親昵地喊道：</p>
<p>「幼三嫂來這麽一盃，祝福幼三哥馬到成功！……」</p>
<p>於是他們自己高高的舉起酒盃，傾喉直注，而她便要開始着不安和焦慮。她是個已習慣於到了有人用親昵的口調呌她男人的名字時，便要觸動一種急　的感覺的。這種感覺，往往使她變成半瘋狂。這時，她底眼睛爲不安燃曉了，她底腦子便不斷地燜灼着他，一個壯健的，有着寬大肩膊和胸膛的年靑農民　單鈍得近於蠢拙的微笑，於是她也微笑起來了，手不自覺地拿起吸酒器，從罐子裏吸取着家製的白乾，一碗一碗地傾注到她枯竭的喉嚨裏，直到她底蒼白的面孔也泛起了紅暈，兩眼燃燒着赤紅的火熖。她底感覺開始模糊了，她感到了這屋子裏的空氣是這麽的悶窒，混濁，幾至於使人欲嘔。眞的，在這時她很渴望着空氣，發深與撫慰，雖然祇是那麽一點兒。於是她便鎖住她底錢櫃，呌六歲的小女孩坐着看店，跨開步望門外奔跑去。賭徒們顧着自己底十二支牌。酒徒們已磕頭在桌上打鼾了。可是却有幾個年靑的半矇矇的夥子跟着她出去。到</p>
<h3>娜拉（廿一）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作著　忻炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉正悲哀地想出去投河自殺，郝爾茂猛力地把房門推開！</p>
<p>郝爾茂：娜拉！你這混賬的婦人！幹得好事！</p>
<p>娜拉：（睜着眼望他丈夫，冷冷的答道）我現在方纔完全明白了。</p>
<p>郝爾茂：你斷送了我的終身幸福，你斷送了我的前程。我現在被你送到那個光棍的手裹，由他勒索，我只好件件依他！至於我和你兩個人，外面還是照常做夫妻，至於孩子，我不敢把他們托付給你了。從今以後，不能再講什麽快樂不快樂，只有遮蓋遮蓋，裝個面子罷了正當郝爾茂發怒的時候，女僕愛蘭又送了封信進來，郝爾茂看了幾行跳起來說道：娜拉，我們有救了，我們兩個人都沒事了。（把借據外面封信都丟在火爐裏燒了以後。）娜拉，我知道你幹那件事情全爲愛我，你千萬不要放在心上。我敢睹咒，我已經饒恕你了。</p>
<p>娜拉：多謝你饒恕我！（向右邊出去）</p>

<p>了門外，那便是一片空闊的田野，她大踏步的奔跑着，發瘋也似的，那些年靑的農民，便在她底背後追趕，嘴裏輕輕的吹着吻哨和低微的呼嘯。</p>
<p>他們奔逐着，在田野裏，在草塲上，而終於沒入於坡靑樹叢裏。她停脚站住猶豫起來了，在她底模糊的腦子裏，他幻想着一個影兒，一個爲她所愛過，抱過熟稔的影兒。這時却全身染滿了血污，癱倒在那兒，離她跟前不遠的田野上；然而，當她定睛看時，却沒有了。她心想：「一定的，他不回來了，他死了！」於是心酸着，咽聲的哭了。</p>
<p>直到她底瘦削的臂膊，被幾隻粗壯的手掌攫住，而且身子也跟着被懸吊起來時，她才知道在她背後原來還有人跟着。跟着的，這是什麽人呢？年靑的，健壯的，像幼三一樣的可愛，勇敢的農民。然而，她却感到一種受侮辱的憤怒；因爲她感到了自己已被這些暴徒們架進那坡靑樹林的深處，進那僻靜的，少男少女們幽會的樹林裏去，而且被輕輕的按倒，有人在撕開她底衣襟，有人在摸索她底胸膛，有人在……。她暴怒了，她底酒淸醒了，她突然想起了自己是在被人用無理的暴力侮辱與損害了。然而，她不能掙扎，人家死緊的按住她，於是她突然尖嘯起來，用憤怒的聲調喊道：</p>
<p>「你們這狗，欺侮得我好啊！幼三吿訴我，他明早就要回來！……」</p>
<p>幼三，幼三，一個粗暴的上等砲兵！年靑的農民顫慄起來了。他們曾都飽嘗過他底苦頭，村裏人沒有一個不怕他的，可是他們現在却侮辱他底老婆，一個溫柔，可愛的小女人。於是大家輕輕的鬆開手，跳躍着，像一粒皮球滾出去</p>
<p>他從田野裏回到家時，是已經深夜了。十二支牌賭散了，酒徒們也散了，她六歲的小女孩却還坐在櫃台上，像一個聰敏的小掌櫃似的打着盹。她跑向她，用手輕輕的撫摸着她底頭髮，她咽聲的哭了。</p>

        <h1>1936.04.10</h1>
<h3>Soviet Reply Delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday; Diplomatic Authorities Carefully Studying and Preparing Appropriate Handling</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Soviet Union's formal reply to our protest document has been delivered to our embassy in the Soviet Union. Simultaneously, instructions were telegraphed to the Soviet embassy in China to deliver a copy to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry is currently conducting a thorough study. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signing a protocol, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing its infringement on our national sovereignty and violation of the Sino-Soviet Agreement, lodged a serious protest with the Soviet government on the 7th of this month, declaring the protocol invalid. It is now learned that the Soviet government has formally replied to our protest on the 9th, delivering it to our embassy in the Soviet Union. At 5 PM that same afternoon, the Soviet embassy in China also delivered a copy of the reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that our diplomatic authorities are currently carefully studying the reply, preparing to take appropriate action. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia has rejected the Chinese government's protest against the mutual assistance agreement concluded between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia. Today, Foreign Commissar Litvinov sent a reply to the Chinese chargé d'affaires, stating that China's protest is without basis and expressing his firm belief that the Republic of China government will surely recognize that the agreement does not violate the Sino-Russian Treaty signed in Beijing on May 31, 1924, and that the agreement benefits both Mongolia and China. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Full Reply</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Newspapers are publishing the exchanged documents between the Chinese and Soviet governments. Litvinov's reply to the Chinese chargé d'affaires Wu Nan-ju's April 8th note states:</p>
<p>"On April 7th, you, acting on the orders of your government, presented me with a note, another copy of which was delivered on the same day to the Soviet ambassador to China, Bogomolov. The note states that the agreement drafted between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Mongolia on March 12, 1936, allegedly infringes on Chinese sovereignty and violates the Sino-Soviet Agreement of May 31, 1924. Therefore, the Nanjing government believes it can lodge a protest.</p>
<p>"In response to all of the above, I hereby declare that the Soviet government does not agree with the interpretation of the Soviet-Mongolian agreement made in the Chinese government's note, and therefore cannot acknowledge that the Chinese government's protest is justified.</p>
<p>"Neither the fact of signing the drafted agreement nor its articles infringe on Chinese sovereignty in the slightest. The Soviet Union has also made no territorial claims of any kind on China or the People's Republic of Mongolia.</p>
<p>"The signing of the drafted agreement, in form and in fact, does not cause any changes in the relationship between the Soviet Union and China, and between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Mongolia, a relationship which has long existed. The Soviet Union signed the mutual assistance drafted agreement considering that the Sino-Soviet Agreement concluded in Beijing in 1924 will not be distorted as a result, and will continue to be valid.</p>
<p>"The Soviet government hereby reiterates that the aforementioned agreement regarding the Soviet part will continue to be effective hereafter.</p>
<p>"Regarding the issue of the formal right to conclude agreements with the autonomous regions of the Republic of China, it is worth recalling the agreement concluded on September 20, 1924, between the Soviet government and the government of the Three Eastern Provinces in Shenyang. That agreement did not provoke any protest from the Republic of China government, and even the Chinese government has recognized that the aforementioned Shenyang agreement has the same effect as the Beijing agreement.</p>
<p>"At the same time, it should also be noted that the Soviet-Mongolian agreement does not harm the interests of third countries, as it is only effective when the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of Mongolia become victims of aggression and are forced to defend their own territories.</p>
<p>"Based on all of the above, the Soviet government cannot but consider the Chinese government's protest to be unfounded, and at the same time expresses its deep assurance to make the Republic of China government know for sure that the Soviet-Mongolian drafted agreement does not violate the Beijing agreement, and is also in accordance with the interests of the Mongolian people and even the Chinese people." (TASS dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Statements from Soviet Russian Political Circles</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Political figures have recently issued statements regarding the protocol signed between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia, stating that what this protocol stipulates is that when the territory of one of the signatory countries is threatened by aggression, the other party should fulfill its obligation of mutual assistance with all kinds of aid. This meaning is more substantial than the declaration made by Outer Mongolian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Genden in January of this year (Genden once said, "We hope that if Outer Mongolia is invaded, Soviet Russia will come to its aid.") It is also more explicit than the remarks made by Communist Party General Secretary Stalin to the American Associated Press editor Howard (matter in March of this year), referring to the paragraph where the independence of Outer Mongolia is threatened. However, there are no detailed provisions for mutual assistance clauses in the protocol, because Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia had already established a verbal mutual assistance agreement in 1934. The present specific signing of the protocol is to state the past agreement. As for why Soviet Russia adopted such a resolute attitude, it is said that the frequent disputes on the Mongolian-Manchurian border have contributed to it. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting told reporters that the Russian-Mongolian agreement clearly violates the "Outline for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), and there is no need for further criticism. Its infringement on Chinese sovereignty is also undeniable. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, ​​Saratochev, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 11:00 AM on the 9th to express his views on the Sino-Soviet incident. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Imai Flew to Shanxi; Reinforcements Arrived in Lishi to Encircle and Suppress; All Crossing Points in Shanxi and Shaanxi Have Been Strictly Sealed Off; Xu Donghai's Bandit Troops Defeated in Fangshan County</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Haidong's bandit troops fled from Xing County to the Zhaozhuang and Daxigou area south of Fangshan County. Yesterday afternoon, they engaged in a four-hour battle with Li Shengda's unit, Huo Duan's brigade, etc. We captured a large number of prisoners. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled south. Also, the bandits who fled south from Lin County via Dawu Town arrived near Lishi County yesterday evening. The city is heavily defended, and reinforcements have arrived outside the city to encircle and suppress them. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) After Yang Chengyuan's unit recovered Xiangling, it is now dispatching teams to search and suppress bandits in Beishu Village and Jiasong Village, 30 miles south of the county seat. It seems that the main force of the bandit army is still lurking in that area. Commander Guan telegraphed that the northbound train of the Tongpu Railway has crossed Shicun and will arrive in Linfen in one or two days. There are no traces of bandits along the railway line in that area. Bandit crossing points in Shanxi and Shaanxi have been sealed off. According to a military official in charge, the bandits' route of arrival has been cut off, and their retreat route has also been cut off. The remaining bandits in Shanxi are now being severely attacked by the various routes of the National Army. The bandits have suffered heavy casualties, and it is expected that they can be eliminated soon. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Legislative member Deng Hongye left Taiyuan for Beijing this afternoon. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Our army is strictly preventing the remaining bandits from Shaanxi from crossing the river eastward, deploying heavy forces along the river, strictly sealing off all crossing points, and patrolling back and forth along the coast to cut off the connection between the remaining bandits and their old nest in northern Shaanxi. The routes of the bandits in the province have been cut off, and they are being suppressed by the National Army day by day. Their numbers are decreasing, and their ammunition is lacking. It can be eliminated soon. After Yang Cheng's division recovered Xiangling on the 5th, they continued to search and suppress the remaining bandits in the suburbs of the city. They are now advancing toward the bandits in the Beishu Village and Jiasong Village area, more than 30 miles south of Xiangling. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Guo Brigade of Yang Chengyuan's unit engaged in a fierce battle with more than 2,000 bandits in Jiaxi and Jia Villages south of Xiangling on the morning of the 8th. By 3:00 AM, the bandits retreated to the nearby mountaintops and stubbornly resisted. Only at 6:00 PM did they completely collapse and flee. They appeared to be fleeing towards Xiangning County. Our army is still advancing. After Song Kentang's division recovered Hongdong County, Lu Ji and Guan Linwei's units have entered to assist in the suppression. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military attaché Imai flew from Beiping to Shanxi by Japanese plane at 7:30 AM today to investigate the bandit situation. He is scheduled to fly back on the 10th. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lieutenant Colonel Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Japanese Army Department in Tianjin, and Major Mai Moulin flew to Suiyuan at 7:00 AM on the 9th to侦察共势. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tong Zemin, the security commander of the First District of Hebei, has taken office. The headquarters is located in Cangxian County, governing more than ten counties including Cangzhou, to strictly prevent 共祸. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>No Bandit Traces in Suiyuan Territory</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain agency received a telegram from Suiyuan at 4:00 PM on the 8th, stating that there are no bandit traces in the territory. Xu Haidong and other bandits, 2,000 to 3,000 people near Xing County in northern Shanxi, once fled north.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the "Soviet-Mongolian Protocol"</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia recently signed the "Soviet-Mongolian Protocol" in Kulun. It stipulates that if either the Soviet Union or Outer Mongolia is invaded by a third country in the future, the contracting party should provide various forms of assistance to the invaded party. Our central authorities believe that this action by the Soviet Union not only disregards our national sovereignty, but also violates the promise of the "Outline for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" agreement of the 13th year of the Republic (1924). A protest was lodged with the Soviet government on the 7th of this month. However, in the reply from Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov yesterday, it was claimed that this action by the Soviet Union did not infringe on our national sovereignty, and that this protocol is not only beneficial to Outer Mongolia, but also beneficial to China. The two sides have completely opposite views on the issue of infringing on sovereignty. Let's examine this point from a historical perspective.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia is located on our northern frontier, bordering Liaoning and Heilongjiang in the east, Xinjiang in the west, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia in the south, and bordering Soviet Siberia in the north. It is not only a screen for our northern region, but also a place that Japan and the Soviet Union must compete for in their hegemony in East Asia. Before the Russo-Japanese War, Tsarist Russia, due to geographical convenience, first invaded the south. The Treaty of Kyakhta in 1851 was the beginning of this southward invasion. After the Russo-Japanese War, Tsarist Russia, having failed in Manchuria, devoted all its efforts to invading Outer Mongolia. In the first year of the Republic (1912), it incited Outer Mongolia to secede from our country and become independent. The following year, it concluded the Third Secret Agreement with Japan, dividing Mongolia into eastern and western parts, with 116 degrees 17 minutes east longitude as the boundary. Each tacitly acknowledged that the former was Japan's area of ​​development and the latter was Tsarist Russia's area of ​​development. Later, although our country concluded the Sino-Russian Agreement and the Sino-Russian-Mongolian Agreement with Tsarist Russia in the third and fifth years of the Republic (1914 and 1916), making Tsarist Russia legally recognize Outer Mongolia as part of our country's territory, due to multiple national troubles and an unstable national defense, relying solely on the provisions of the treaty could not ultimately prevent the infiltration of Tsarist Russian forces. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union abandoned the Japanese-Russian Secret Agreement, and Japan instigated the White Russian Semyonov to occupy Kulun and send personnel to instigate Mongolian bandits to become independent. After the ninth year of the Republic (1920), although the White Russians entrenched in Kulun were repelled by the Soviet Union, our country's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia was trampled on by the Soviet Union due to the Mongolian-Russian Agreement and the Mongolian-Russian Secret Agreement in the tenth and twelfth years of the Republic (1921 and 1923). On May 31, 1924, in the thirteenth year of the Republic, the "Outline for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" was signed in Beijing, with Article 5 stipulating that "The Soviet government recognizes Outer Mongolia as an integral part of the complete Republic of China and respects China's sovereignty within that territory." From a legal point of view, our country's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia has now been recognized by the Soviet Union. However, in reality, the Soviet Union has not only been more actively managing Outer Mongolia with political and economic power, but has also often secretly obstructed our country's exercise of sovereignty in Outer Mongolia. After the September 18th Incident, Japan continued to advance into the mainland, and conflicts arose from time to time on the Soviet-Manchurian border. The trend of a Japanese-Soviet war was imminent. In order to cope with this future war, Japan had to first engage in deployments in the Greater Khingan Range area to facilitate military advancement. At the same time, the Soviet Union also regarded Outer Mongolia as a fortress for the anti-Japanese war, and disregarded our country's sovereignty by arbitrarily concluding a treaty with Outer Mongolia to suit its own interests. The "Soviet-Mongolian Protocol" was produced under this situation of war preparations by Japan and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, in any case, one country's lord-ship rights over another country's territory must be respected. Otherwise, it is aggression. When Litvinov defined an aggressor country in the past, he also made such an explanation. Since the Soviet Union recognizes Outer Mongolia as part of our country's territory, it should respect our country's sovereignty. Even if it believes that it is necessary in fact to conclude any treaty with Outer Mongolia, it should conclude it directly with Outer Mongolia. This infringement on our country's sovereignty and violation of the promise of the "Outline for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" is self-evident. Therefore, we cannot recognize this kind of protocol in terms of reason or law.</p>
<h3>Amending the "Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering National Currency"; All Seven Articles Amended, Two Articles to be Discussed by the Legislative Yuan Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong previously proposed to the Executive Yuan, stating in brief that since the implementation of the legal tender, private transactions, public and private receipts and payments must not use cash, and silver coins held should be exchanged for legal tender. However, as the people have been accustomed to using silver coins for a long time, it is inevitable that some will privately hoard silver coins and silver, or even smuggle them out of the country for profit, which hinders the promotion of the legal tender. It is urgent to clearly define the law, to stipulate punishments for those who use silver coins or silver as general currency, or who hide, collect, deliver, receive, smuggle, or carry them privately, so as to warn those who break the law and complete the legal tender policy. It is noted that the "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering National Currency" was promulgated and implemented by the National Government on July 15th of last year. These regulations must be supplemented in light of the current situation. The original regulations have now been revised and are proposed to be submitted for deliberation and promulgation in order to conform to the facts and facilitate promotion. Premier Sun approved it to the Finance and Criminal Law Committees for review. The two committees completed the review long ago and submitted it to the Executive Yuan meeting last week for deliberation. Because the agenda was crowded, it was not proposed. It is now proposed to the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 10th for deliberation. The "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering National Currency" after the two committees' review and revision have seven articles. Except for Articles 1 and 2, which are newly revised, the rest retain the existing provisions. The newly revised provisions are as follows: Anyone who uses silver coins or silver as general currency shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than six months, detention, or a fine not more than twice the value of the currency or its equivalent, or both. The same shall apply to those who collect, deliver to others, or transport with the intention of providing it for use, or with the intention of profiting. The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to those who have been permitted by government order due to special circumstances. Anyone who buys, sells, or destroys silver coins or Central Mint strips with the intention of profiting shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years, and may also be fined not more than three times the value of the currency or its equivalent.

<h3>Issues Regarding the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly; Fu Bingchang Has Two Points of Opinion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of dividing districts in various provinces for the election of representatives to the National Assembly, according to Fu Bingchang's opinion, provinces should be divided into ten or several districts depending on the size of the province. The number of people to be elected in each district should follow the principle established by Sun Yat-sen that the county should be the unit of local administration, and the number of people should be allocated according to the number of counties, as stated in his will. However, since counties vary in size and population density, he proposes two points to remedy this: First, in counties with prosperous populations and developed commerce, vocational elections are sufficient to compensate. Second, places with prosperous markets have mostly become cities, and the number of candidates to be elected in cities is double that of counties. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>

In the future, the mint will open and mint new types of subsidiary coins issued by the central government, and has submitted a report to the Political Council for approval. During the trial run, one-cent subsidiary coins will be minted first, and other two-cent and five-cent coins will also be minted one after another. The expenses of the mint are paid by the Political Council, and thousands of pounds of raw materials have been purchased.

<h3>France Submits Secret Document to Britain, Demanding a Firm Stance Against Germany; If No Assistance is Provided, It Will Act Freely; The Rhine Issue Should Be Handled Primarily by the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Flandin met with British Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon and personally delivered a secret note. Germany has clearly expressed its attitude towards the agreement formulated by the Locarno Conference on March 19. The signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty should make a decision. The note contains a detailed explanation of France's views on this matter, provided for British study. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty must wait until Belgian Prime Minister Janson arrives here before they can seriously begin discussions. French Foreign Minister Flandin spoke with British Foreign Secretary Eden for two hours yesterday and issued a statement to Eden stating that since Germany has clearly rejected the agreement reached by the Locarno Conference on the 19th of last month, negotiations between the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty and Germany must be suspended. The promises made to France and Belgium regarding security should also be implemented. In addition, Flandin also advocated that the Council of the League of Nations should put forward a proposal to maintain peace and restore international rule of law. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin presented a secret note to British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday in Geneva. Le Petit Parisien commented on it, saying, "Although the contents of this note are extremely confidential, it is possible to infer that France no longer believes that Germany is willing to reach a compromise. Therefore, it is requesting the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty to take necessary measures to force Germany to admit its mistakes and remedy them. Furthermore, Germany's plan to build reinforced concrete fortifications in the Rhine area to isolate France from its allies in Central Europe is intolerable to France. If the other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty are unwilling to assist France, then France must reserve the right to act freely." L'Intransigeant reported, "Foreign Minister Flandin has stated to British Foreign Secretary Eden that once negotiations with Germany are deemed to have failed, he intends to take appropriate measures in the economic and financial spheres." (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Daily Telegraph of London reported yesterday that if Germany violates Article 42 of the Treaty of Versailles and builds fortifications in the Rhine area, France should send troops to occupy the Saar region. It also stated that France is now preparing to attend the Council of the League of Nations with Germany to discuss the proposals put forward in Germany's memorandum, but only on the condition that Germany participates in the organization of a European collective security system. French Foreign Minister Flandin formally denied this and stated that international rule of law has been destroyed since Germany sent troops into the Rhine area. Negotiations with Germany can only proceed after the situation is restored to its original state. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Unwelcomes French Peace Plan</h3>
<p>Believing it to be Mere High-Sounding Talk, Britain Also Expresses Indifference</p>
<p>(London) The European peace plan proposed by France in its reply to Hitler's memorandum of April 1 has generally been met with little enthusiasm in Geneva and Berlin. Geneva considers it to be fanciful, ambitious, and impracticable, and even the French in Geneva have not welcomed it warmly. On the German side, it is described as artificial and lacking sincerity, and it is said that the French plan includes all the reasons for failure that have been lost in the past decade. A senior official in the German Foreign Office told a Reuters reporter that Germany does not want to reject the French counter-proposal immediately. This counter-proposal is merely a compilation of various ideas and does not contain any concrete elements, and its suggestions are mostly those that have been proven impracticable, merely re-proposing plans that have already been discussed. As for France's question of whether Germany has given up its claims to Memel, Danzig, etc., "we have already made various assurances, and the world need not worry itself." (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The European security plan related to France's reply to the German memorandum has been met with indifference by the newspapers this morning, and they believe that the British government should renew its efforts to gather countries to plan for a solution in Europe. The Daily Telegraph stated that part of France's proposal is completely impracticable. Recent experience of international disputes has made it clear that a joint guard force of various countries is far removed from the actual situation in Europe. The French reply has forced the British government to seek new avenues for negotiation. Before negotiations begin, there will be some fantasies of European peace that will confuse people. The Daily Mail stated that the urgent problem at present is to prepare a method of collective effort, so that the French-German plan and other contributions from various countries can be combined into a practical and generally acceptable overall plan. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times editorial today stated that it is highly questionable whether France's various proposals are practicable. Europe cannot yet be said to have reached a mature stage where it can largely abandon the sovereignty it demands. But taken as a whole, the French proposal is an elaborate and far-reaching plan and should not be met with purely destructive criticism. It should be studied in conjunction with the German proposal. What is urgently needed at present is to remove various obstacles so that an orderly and permanent organization of peace can be discussed. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post commented on the construction plan put forward by the French government, saying, "Foreign Minister Flandin seems to still have hope for the League of Nations and collective security, as well as the sacredness of various international obligations, but in light of recent events, this hope may turn into a bubble. Abyssinia is a member state of the League of Nations, as everyone knows, and although its sovereignty and territorial integrity are guaranteed by the covenant, its fate is uncertain. Is this sacred? In addition, the combat methods adopted by the Italian army are reported to have violated the Geneva Convention and used poison gas. Is this sacred? Therefore, the League of Nations and its tools are not enough to replace the old alliance system and guarantee security." The Morning Post also said, "Foreign Minister Flandin's intention is to improve the League of Nations. If this is not possible, should it be ended?" (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Criticize "French-Style" Peace</h3>
<p>The Memorandum is like a Towering Skyscraper</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials were initially cautious and silent about the French memorandum, but this morning the newspapers began to criticize it fiercely. This may be due to instructions issued by Führer Hitler, but this is uncertain. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that the French memorandum is like a towering skyscraper, focusing on ambitious propaganda. "But the peace in the minds of the French is not what the Germans call peace. A brief glance is enough to know that the proposals put forward by Führer Hitler are simple and clear, while the French memorandum is structurally empty and purely illusory." (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the French memorandum was published, the government has not yet studied it, so officials have not made any criticisms. Führer Hitler has left here for his villa in Berchtesgaden in Bavaria for a few days. He has not been in contact with the Foreign Ministry at present. As for the German representative Ribbentrop, he is now in London and will not be able to return to the country until tomorrow. He plans to stop in Cologne on the way. It is still unknown whether he will go directly to Berchtesgaden to meet Hitler or return to Berlin from Cologne. As of now, the only German commentary on the French memorandum is a semi-official statement issued by the German side in Geneva, which said that the French parliamentary election campaign is underway, and this memorandum was issued for the campaign. "The so-called construction plan is merely a plagiarism of old cases and does not put forward any practical and beneficial suggestions. People in Geneva are very disappointed." (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Newspapers Also Mock French Caution; House of Representatives Discusses Military Service Law</h3>
<p>Brussels: Most newspapers comment on the French memorandum, although they may use cautious wording, but mostly express sympathy. Their books say, "The dispute between France and Germany still exists, and it is undeniable that France's position in terms of jurisprudence is impeccable. Germany also claims to be legal, but it is unknown how to mediate it. French Prime Minister Sarraut has adopted a firm and cautious attitude from the beginning, and the Belgian people all hope that he can maintain it." The Catholic publication Vingtième Siècle expressed opposition to France, saying, "If the Rhine region issue is re-proposed at this time, it is a rash move. In Belgium, it is only a local event. As for our inherent common sense, this dispute should be resolved locally, and then gradually eliminate all the causes of unease, which is more appropriate." (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Brussels: When the House of Representatives discussed the military service system yesterday, Prime Minister Janson issued a statement saying, "I am scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow to participate in international negotiations, and I will explain frankly that the arms race is a path to self-destruction. All countries should know this." The military service system reform plan was originally proposed by the government, and its content is to request the House of Representatives to give the government full powers to freely decide the number of recruits and extend the term of military service. It has been approved by the House Defense Committee. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Demands Results; Albania Willing to Negotiate Directly with Italy</h3>
<p>But the Peace Talks Must Be Watched by Neutral Observers; If Italy Accepts, It Will Begin Within the Next Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen decided yesterday to re-entrust Chairman Madariaga and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to explore the opinions of Italy and Albania regarding the peace issue. The Albanian representative, the country's ambassador to France, Gjevaheri, has accepted the request of British Foreign Secretary Eden, stating that he is willing to conduct direct negotiations with Italy, but requests that neutral observers closely monitor the talks. These observers may be concurrently held by Madariaga, but this is uncertain. If Italy can accept this procedure, then negotiations between Italy and Albania can begin within the next week. It is not yet known whether Italy will immediately cease fire or wait until Italy and Albania reach an agreement before ceasing fire. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the dispute between Italy and Albania, the Albanian representative, the country's ambassador to France, Gjevaheri, visited British Foreign Secretary Eden and stated to him that his government is now prepared to conduct peace talks, but the negotiations should be conducted within the scope of the League of Nations. Eden then consulted with Madariaga, chairman of the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. Observers believe that Britain and several other national delegations firmly believe that concrete steps must be taken to resolve the dispute between Italy and Albania before they can leave Geneva. Therefore, the Committee of Thirteen may have to extend its session until after Easter. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen entrusted Chairman Madariaga and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol yesterday to inquire with the two parties involved whether they could cease hostilities before April 14. Observers here claim that it is difficult for Italy to comply. Its reply will probably not be more than two points: 1. After the Committee of Thirteen proposed peace negotiations in March of this year, Albanian troops first attacked Italian troops. 2. Wherever the Italian army goes, the natives applaud and celebrate as liberators and are now assisting the Italian army in pursuing the troops belonging to the Albanian Emperor.

<h3>Britain and France Have Different Priorities on the Italian Issue</h3>
<p>The Committee of Thirteen Discussed for a Long Time</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Thirteen met today for a long time to consider whether to immediately begin peace talks between Italy and Albania. After discussion, it was resolved to authorize Chairman Madariaga and League Secretary-General Avenol to visit the Italian representative to the League Council, Aloisi, to inquire about Italy's attitude towards a ceasefire. According to British Foreign Secretary Eden, if the efforts of the two cannot agree on a ceasefire, the British government must reserve its attitude. Eden also firmly stated that there should be no further delay. We must make the war end immediately and negotiate within the League of Nations framework. French Foreign Minister Flandin did not think it was appropriate to act hastily and proposed that the two be given until April 14 to receive a reply from Rome. Eden replied resentfully that the Committee did not seem to be accused of acting hastily. The Committee should have discussed the use of poison gas by Italian troops in Albania and resolved to establish a small committee of public law experts to review the violation of the 1925 convention prohibiting the use of gas. The Committee also discussed whether to discuss it or whether it should be handed over to the League of Nations Council for discussion. The British delegation sent a document to the Committee based on reports from Abyssinians and non-Abyssinians, stating the use of poison gas by Italian troops and presenting the evidence of Dr. Mele, a British Red Cross volunteer, Dr. Mark, a worker in the British ambulance team, Dr. White Roswell of Ireland, and a talk from Dr. Junod, an official of the International Red Cross, indicating that they had treated many Abyssinian soldiers poisoned by gas in Abyssinia. The Committee then adjourned until 4 p.m. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A special dispatch from our agency's diplomatic correspondent reveals that after the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen met today, it has been proven that Britain and France have different opinions on resolving the dispute between Italy and Albania. France advocates that if the war between Italy and Albania is to be stopped quickly, sanctions must also be stopped at the same time. This is the same as Foreign Minister Flandin's speech in the House of Representatives on March 20 (in which he said that both the war between Italy and Albania and sanctions against Italy should be stopped quickly). In Britain, it is advocated that if Italy refuses to negotiate, sanctions should be intensified because of the country's use of suffocating gas. Foreign Secretary Eden also said, "The fate of Europe depends on whether this issue can be resolved. Assuming that London, Paris, and Berlin are attacked by toxic gas, what will be the damage? We cannot help but be frightened when we think about this." Regarding this matter, Foreign Minister Flandin believed that the Italian and Albanian armies were reported to have committed atrocities, and if the Red Cross needs to conduct an investigation, it should be done without distinction. However, this kind of problem is related to combat methods, and the Committee of Thirteen has no right to make a decision. Therefore, it proposed to organize a committee of legal experts to investigate whether there was any violation of wartime laws. The British delegation recently issued a document stating the various evidence of the Italian army's use of suffocating gas, including the reports submitted by the doctors of the British Red Cross ambulance team and the notes repeatedly sent by the Albanian government to the League of Nations.

<h3>League of Nations Investigates Italian Use of Poison Gas; British Representative Presents Various Pieces of Evidence; A Legal Staff Committee is Now Organized to Handle It</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen appointed a legal expert staff committee yesterday to draft a report on the combat methods of the Italian and Albanian armies, so that it can be submitted for discussion today. It is known that the Committee of Thirteen has decided to discuss it at 4 p.m. today. According to general knowledge, the results of the study by the expert staff committee are that the protests submitted by the two parties involved, Italy and Albania, regarding the combat methods of the other party must first be discussed by the League of Nations Council, because this issue is not within the scope of the Committee's authority. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Thirteen continued its meeting at 4 p.m. this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Eden presented a brief memorandum on the spot for discussion. The memorandum was related to the issue of the Italian army's use of poison gas. After a long debate, the Committee passed a resolution to establish another expert committee to study the legal point of view of this violation of the international convention on wartime affairs, whether the Committee of Thirteen has the right to jurisdiction, or should be handed over to the League of Nations Council for resolution. Regarding the mediation of the dispute between Italy and Albania, it was also resolved to ask the Chairman to quickly conduct preliminary talks with the Italian representative to the League Council, Aloisi, who is currently in Geneva, together with League Secretary-General Avenol. Once there is a clue, formal discussions will be held. At this point, the meeting adjourned until tomorrow afternoon. (National News dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen met this afternoon at 4 p.m. and ended at 6:30 p.m. The legal experts of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Badevant, the legal experts of the British Foreign Office, Malkin, and the Spanish representative Ariwen were appointed to form a legal expert staff committee to specialize in studying the combat methods of the Italian and Albanian armies, especially the issue of the Italian army's violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the use of suffocating gas in Albania (according to this protocol, it was signed on September 20, 1925, stating that the signatory countries prohibit the use of various toxic gases and microbial methods in combat). The Committee must submit a report when the Committee of Thirteen continues its meeting at 4 p.m. tomorrow afternoon. In addition, the Committee of Thirteen also re-entrusted Chairman Madariaga and League Secretary-General Avenol to explore the opinions of the two parties involved, Italy and Albania, regarding the peace issue. The Italian representative Aloisi will come here tomorrow, and Madariaga will meet with him at that time. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Still Seeks to Make Itself Important by Relying on Germany and Austria to Deal with the League of Nations' Intensified Sanctions</h3>
<p>(Rome) Well-informed sources recently stated that if the League of Nations' proposal to intensify sanctions against Italy is implemented, Italy will take countermeasures politically. Italy is prepared to change its attitude towards the European situation and will henceforth promote friendly relations with Austria without hesitation. Austria has recently adopted a work-service military system and has begun to rearm. Although Germany is wary, it is sympathetic, so the original estrangement between Italy and Germany has been reduced a lot. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Investment in China: Armed Protection Ultimately Does More Harm Than Good - Words from the Secretary-General of the Anti-War Association</h3>
<p>Kansai: Mr. Libby, Secretary-General of the American Anti-War Association, declared today that no matter how much money is spent on armaments, it will be difficult to protect American investments in China. He predicts that the U.S. military budget for the coming year will exceed $1,000,000,000. He also stated that American investments in China amount to only $130,000,000, but if one were to resort to war to protect this amount of investment, it would cost a huge sum of $40,000,000,000. From this, it can be seen that protecting investments by force is actually a losing proposition. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Spain - Cabinet Resigns, Asked to Stay</h3>
<p>Elect New President Within Five Weeks</p>
<p>Madrid: After the resignation of former President Zamorra, Prime Minister Azana submitted his resignation to interim President Baliwo, but Baliwo asked him to stay, so he withdrew his resignation. According to well-informed sources, former President Zamorra originally intended to appeal to the Constitutional Court regarding the results of the House of Representatives vote, but has now abandoned this plan and will soon move his family to the city of Puerto Rico in the state of Cordova to live as a commoner. At this time, who is the most promising successor to the presidency? Speculation abounds in various quarters. Generally, the most respected candidate is Baliwo himself. However, Baliwo's political friends said that he is currently the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the leader of the United Republican Party, and his political status is extremely high. Moreover, as for the position of Prime Minister, apart from the current Prime Minister Azana, Baliwo is the most qualified. Therefore, he may not be willing to accept the election as head of state. Political figures believe that Roman, the head of the Republican National Party, may have hopes of succeeding as president. Although he has not actively participated in political activities, the left-wing People's Front, which impeached Zamorra, fully supports him. (Eighth Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid: Since President Zamora formally announced his resignation, according to the provisions of the current Spanish constitution, the election of the new president should be handled within five weeks from the date of the president's formal resignation. In other words, a qualified presidential elector must be elected before May 14 of this year to help the Congress elect a new president. According to general observations, the three candidates with the highest voices for the new president are: Mr. Baliwo, former Prime Minister and current Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Arponas, former President of the Constitutional Draft Review Court, Mr. Pesters, former Speaker of the Senate and leader of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party.

<h3>U.S. Presidential Election</h3>

The Progressives and La Follette's Third Party are now in cahoots with the Democratic Party. However, Borah has already obtained a majority of the 24 delegates designated to attend the Republican National Convention. Therefore, in the presidential election between Roosevelt and Borah, it is still impossible to predict who will win. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>France's Second Memorandum</h3>
<p>(Paris) In addition to submitting the first memorandum in response to the German memorandum, France also submitted a second memorandum detailing the peace plan, which begins by saying, "The Government of the French Republic, in making this proposal, aims to maintain the honor of all nations and have them fulfill their promises, respect the equal rights of all nations, encourage international trade, and achieve universal, complete, and lasting peace, and by genuinely limiting armaments, to take steps to reduce armaments, in order to achieve genuine peace."</p>
<p>This plan is based on the following principles:</p>
<p>Equality of rights and respect for international obligations must be ensured. The French government believes that if peace depends on the needs and desires of various nations, then peace will ultimately be unattainable.</p>
<p>The rule of international law should have mandatory and substantial guarantees.</p>
<p>Hegemony is not allowed. The French government believes that all countries should be able to freely relinquish part of their sovereignty under certain circumstances, especially in the matter of armaments. If there are disparities in the military strength of various countries, a universal mutual assistance pact can be concluded to remedy this.</p>
<p>As for politically viable measures, the French government believes that the European continent is the standard region for organizing a collective security system. However, if the whole of Europe is considered too vast to become a single entity based on the principle of mutual assistance, it can be divided into several regions, thereby establishing several regional public bodies. Within the framework of the League of Nations, a pan-European committee can be organized to take on organizational matters, which is also possible. Changes to the existing borders of various countries must be implemented only with the mutual agreement of the countries concerned. However, countries may not demand changes to the existing borders within 25 years. In addition, the countries concerned must agree on appropriate measures for the fulfillment of treaty obligations, especially with regard to arms reduction, which should include military means. Regarding this matter, each signatory to the general European convention or regional conventions shall designate army, air force, and naval units to be placed under the command of the League of Nations and the pan-European committee. This committee shall also monitor the fulfillment of the obligations of various provisions. Once the mutual assistance system is organized, genuine arms reduction can be realized. When the pan-European committee discusses the issue of arms reduction, it only needs a two-thirds majority to make a decision. All current and future treaties in Europe must be submitted to the committee for record, and those that conflict with the general European convention or regional conventions may be declared invalid by the committee.</p>
<p>The memorandum then puts forward five economic proposals, believing that economic improvement is primarily to maintain peace. After the establishment of a European political organization, economic organization must be started. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>European countries should adopt a preferential tariff system and mutually conclude tariff treaties to develop trade.</p>
<p>Sign international agreements or European agreements to limit current tariff protection policies, implement a tariff truce, and establish an international trade court to prevent the arbitrary abolition of commercial agreements.</p>
<p>Organize a monetary credit system within Europe.</p>
<p>The distribution of colonial resources should be corrected so that European countries can obtain the necessary raw materials.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned measures should be handled by a special committee established by the pan-European committee and submitted to an international conference for discussion. All member states or non-member states of the League of Nations should be invited to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>The second memorandum then concludes that this peace plan is not in conflict with the League of Nations covenant, but is integrated with it. The principles contained in the League of Nations are the highest laws on which this plan is based. (Eighth Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Blue Book - Publishes Documents on Germany</h3>
<p>Total of 59 Types</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet released a Blue Book this morning containing 59 documents, of which a long telegram from Foreign Secretary Eden to Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps on March 26 of this year is the most important. The telegram details the diplomatic talks conducted by the British government from June 1924 to March 7 of this year (the date Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty) to organize a European peace mechanism. This talk can be divided into five parts: Negotiations for the conclusion of the Eastern European Convention, from June 1934 to May 1935 (the time of the signing of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty); The exchange of documents between the countries concerned regarding the question of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is in conflict with the Locarno Treaty, from May 1935 to August of the same year; Progress on negotiations regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Convention during the same period; Negotiations regarding the Sky Convention and the limitation of air force armaments; Attempts made to continue negotiations with Germany from November 1935 to March of this year. The telegram briefly states that "In the view of the British government, the original French draft of the Eastern European Convention had shortcomings in that the guarantees it gave to France and the Soviet Union were not equal to the guarantees it gave to Germany. For this reason, Britain and France held talks in London on July 11, 1934, to remedy this. As a result, the following approach was drafted: that the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Finland, and the Baltic countries (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) conclude a mutual guarantee of non-aggression and mutual consultation convention, and that the Soviet Union accept the obligations of the guarantor states of the Locarno Treaty for France and Germany, while France accept the obligations stipulated in the above-mentioned mutual non-aggression and mutual consultation convention for Germany and Russia, provided that its obligations are not in conflict with the obligations France bears under the League of Nations Covenant." After this approach was determined, Britain immediately urged the countries concerned, especially Germany and Poland, to accept it, but neither country agreed. Germany also made it clear in the autumn of 1934 that it was willing to maintain peace in Eastern Europe in a way that was acceptable to both sides. Therefore, France and the Soviet Union signed a protocol in Geneva on December 5 of that year, mutually agreeing that neither country would participate in any negotiations that aimed at concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements that would hinder the establishment of the Eastern European Convention. On March 25, 1935, former British Foreign Secretary Simon and Foreign Secretary Eden (then Lord Privy Seal) went to Berlin together. German leader Hitler informed the British cabinet members of the outline of the proposed Eastern European Convention, the content of which advocated that Eastern European countries conclude bilateral non-aggression pacts and separately conclude arbitration, conciliation, and consultation agreements, and that each of these countries provide a promise not to assist aggressor countries to supplement this. "At the time, leader Hitler also stated that if the above-mentioned bilateral agreements were to be included in a multilateral agreement system, the German government would not oppose it. However, since Germany did not approve of mutual assistance methods, it would not be convenient to join the mutual assistance convention. During the meeting between Britain, France, and Italy in Stressa last April, the German government, at the request of British Ambassador Sir Phipps, issued an announcement stating that Germany was prepared to participate in the Eastern European Convention in accordance with the outline outlined on March 25, provided that the other signatory countries agreed on mutual assistance methods, but with the condition that the mutual assistance methods be included in individual agreements. After this announcement was issued, the French government decided not to wait any longer and immediately negotiated a mutual assistance convention with the Soviet Union." At that time, Britain asked France whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was in conflict with the Locarno Treaty. France immediately replied that "France has put forward an absolute condition for the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, that is, the obligations of this treaty are not only subject to the restrictions of the application of the League of Nations Covenant, but also subject to the restrictions of the application of the Locarno Treaty. The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was finally signed and established on May 2 of last year. On the 21st of the same month, German leader Hitler delivered a speech stating that France and the Soviet Union had already formed a military alliance. What kind of impact and consequences this agreement will have on the treaty obligations borne by the countries concerned by the Locarno Treaty, Germany hopes to obtain an accurate explanation. As far as Germany is concerned, the German government will fulfill all obligations arising from the Locarno Treaty." Afterwards, the countries concerned exchanged documents on the issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was in conflict with the Locarno Treaty. Former British Foreign Secretary Sir Hoare ordered Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps on July 5 of last year to express to the German government that the rights and obligations of all signatories to the Locarno Treaty, including Germany, have not been harmed or changed by the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. It is hoped that the German government will recognize this. In the same month, the British government again contacted Germany, wanting to repeat the judgment on the Eastern European Convention. Regarding this matter, German Deputy Foreign Minister Bulow informed the British representative on August 22 of last year that the German government could not make any statement before October.

<h3>Ministry of Justice Clarifies Ambiguities Regarding Gambling Crimes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Zhejiang Higher Court submitted a request for clarification regarding ambiguities in gambling crimes. The Ministry of Justice explained: 1. Gambling for property within one's own residence or household, not in a public place or a place accessible to the public, does not constitute a crime under Article 266 of the Criminal Law. 2. If the homeowner or head of household, with the intent to profit, provides their residence for gambling and skims from the winnings, they shall be jointly held criminally liable. However, those who are injured or those who gamble are not committing a crime since it's neither a public or publicly accessible place. 3. If there is credible evidence that gambling crimes are being committed in the residence of a current official and the situation is urgent, judicial police may directly search the premises in accordance with Article 131, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law. However, the points raised in the document do not involve any circumstances under Articles 267 or 268 of the Criminal Law, and since no crime has been committed, arrests may not be carried out.

<h3>Japanese Military Representative Stationed in Tianjin, Matsumuro Takayoshi, Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Ordered to Advance to the Great Wall Line to Preside Over Hebei-Chahar Diplomatic Negotiations</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the Hebei-Chahar situation, after Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, went to Tianjin last month to exchange views with relevant parties in a private capacity, it is now known that the discussions have largely taken shape as of the 30th of last month. In the near future, both parties can begin negotiations based on the agreed scope.</p>
<p>Regarding Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, before Doihara returned to his country, the Japanese Kwantung Army came forward, and Doihara's qualification was as a special representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army. After Doihara's return, Matsumuro Takayoshi succeeded him, but his qualification was changed to a representative of the Japanese army in Tianjin, responsible for all future Japanese negotiations in North China.</p>
<p>Matsumuro once served as an advisor to Feng Yuxiang during the National Army era and was very congenial with Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying. His appointment to this position leads to general speculation that future negotiations may be better than in the past. Matsumuro arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the morning of the 6th to set up the Beiping Representative Office of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin. He began working within days. The organization is divided into four sections, with Hamada as his assistant. On the 6th and 7th, Matsumuro met with reporters from China, Britain, the United States, Germany, and France at the Fusang Hotel. The content of his talks varied due to his position. In general, he spoke relatively politely to the Chinese press, adopted a tone resembling a statement to the Japanese press, and used the full range of diplomatic rhetoric to the British, American, German, and French reporters, without committing to anything.</p>
<p>In summary, Matsumuro has prepared to begin Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations. Song Zheyuan is also scheduled to return to Beiping within a week to take charge personally. According to unofficial news, the Japanese Central Military Department seemed to have issued a certain order on the 2nd of this month, dispatching the [unclear] division to advance to the Great Wall line. At the same time, the counties in the "war zone" have been busy vacating houses in recent days. However, the relevant parties here say they have not received such reports. The truth will soon be confirmed.</p>
<p>Matsumuro Expresses Views on Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue was once stalled after the Japanese representative Doihara returned to his country. Matsumuro Takayoshi, attached to the command of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, arrived in Beiping on the 6th at 11:38 AM on the 6th train of the Beining Railway. After getting off the train, he went to the Fusang Hotel to rest. He is scheduled to establish an office attached to the command of the Japanese garrison in Dongjiaominxiang around the 10th. Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun hosted a banquet on the 7th to welcome Matsumuro. When reporters interviewed Matsumuro at the Fusang Hotel, Matsumuro was wearing a Japanese major general-level military uniform and spoke Chinese fluently. However, he said with a smile that he had been away from China for a long time and had forgotten most of his Chinese. He then switched to speaking Japanese, which was translated by an interpreter. His remarks were recorded as follows: "In the future, all negotiations in North China will be handled by the representative of the Japanese government attached to the command of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin. I came to Beiping as a representative of the garrison command and will be stationed in Beiping permanently, responsible for all communication and liaison matters between China and Japan. I will not leave Beiping in the short term and have not prepared to visit Jin, Chahar, or Suiyuan. I will set up an office attached to the command in Beiping, but I definitely do not intend to set up a special agency. The office organization is simple, with only one assistant besides myself. The office is currently being set up and will take about ten days to establish. Regarding the North China issue, because I have been away from China for a long time, I am not clear about the situation. I only saw that the lives of the people seemed more difficult than when I last came to China on the way to Beiping. Regarding Hebei-Chahar negotiations, because I have just arrived in China from Japan, my mind is like a blank sheet of paper and I have no impressions. Therefore, I have no comments to make. However, to seek Sino-Japanese friendship, both parties should be based on sincerity, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the goal. I met Chairman Song Zheyuan several times in Tianjin. Because I am an old friend of Song, we were happy to meet after a long separation. Besides reminiscing about the past, we did not discuss anything else. I am not very familiar with the increase in troops by the Japanese garrison in North China. Regarding the communist bandits disturbing Shanxi, I believe that the spread of the communist scourge is not just a problem for China, but a major problem for the entire East Asia. China is suffering from the communist scourge, and Japan is also deeply concerned. Therefore, Japan attaches great importance to this. As for the current situation of the anti-communist military in Shanxi Province, because it is an internal problem of China, I do not want to express any opinion." In addition to making remarks to the press, Matsumuro also issued his inaugural address as follows: "I am very happy to be newly appointed in the old capital, which was once the crown of cultural regions in the world, and to work with old friends towards new tasks. My task is to work with the officials and people of North China, based on established policies, to quickly complete the clarification of North China to establish a foundation for East Asian peace. However, the communist scourge has spread to Shanxi Province, which is known as a peaceful homeland. Wherever they pass, even chickens and dogs are silent, and the area becomes desolate. Moreover, there are actions in various places that are ignorant of the overall situation in East Asia. Therefore, it can be said that the current situation in North China has reached the greatest crisis and is in a state of suffering. Therefore, I believe that now is the time to rise up and sweep away the 'bad elements' and raise the clear banner of 'anti-communism.' In particular, the reddening of North China is something that the Japanese garrison, which is in an important position to protect Japanese residents, cannot ignore. We also sincerely hope to clarify North China as soon as possible, so that it can become a 'land of happiness' for the people. The entire Japanese nation is determined to make any sacrifices for this. Although I am of limited ability, since I have been ordered to take this position, what I hope from the wise officials and people is that they will realize that violating the policy of 'Sino-Japanese cooperation' is an act of 'destroying the country and misleading the people,' and fully observe and understand the current situation and the true intentions of the Japanese side, and discuss the true path of Sino-Japanese cooperation and saving the country and ensuring the well-being of the people, and resolutely work together to thoroughly prevent communism and make North China clear."

<h3>Japanese Textile Industry Extends Influence Towards Tianjin</h3>
<p>Cheaply Taking Over Bankrupt Yarn Factories, Toyo Textile Company Building New Factory</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese textile industry, under the guidance of the South Manchuria Railway Company, has recently decided to invest in North China. It has been decided to build large-scale yarn factories in Tianjin, including the Toyo Textile Company, the Dai Nippon Textile Company, and the Kanebo Textile Company. The latter two are progressing more slowly in their investigations, so they are currently only buying closed yarn factories in Tianjin, intending to改造 machines to engage in both spinning and weaving. Kanebo Textile Company plans to also set up a woolen factory in addition to these two businesses, intending to purchase raw materials in Jingjiakou to spin wool, wool fabrics, and other goods in Tianjin. In Tianjin, the Baocheng and Beiyang factories, known as the six major yarn factories in Beiyang, are both heavily indebted. The board of directors has cleared them multiple times, but without success. Taking advantage of the factories' plight, Kanebo Textile Company, due to various relationships, is unwilling to come forward itself, so it has entrusted the Tianjin Yuda Yarn Factory to contact Baocheng on its behalf, and the Yicheng Foreign Firm, a shareholder of Yuda, is acting as the nominal investor, funding a lease or a one-time payment for takeover. The two sides are in the process of negotiating the terms. The shareholders of Baocheng are hesitant to sell, so they are willing to sign a contract to lease the factory to Yicheng for a short period of time, but they are still hesitant to sell it outright. The Dai Nippon Textile Company is in contact with the Beiyang Yarn Factory, while the Toyo Textile Company also wants to buy the Beiyang Yarn Factory. The owner of the Beiyang Yarn Factory, Zhang Ruiting, is willing to sell to the Toyo Textile Company because it offered a higher price. The Dai Nippon Textile Company is still working hard to win it over due to business competition. In addition, after the Yuyuan Spinning Mill stopped production and cleared its assets for more than a year, it originally planned to be reorganized as the Xinyi Company, recruiting new shares to maintain operations. However, because of losses of more than five million yuan over the years, Chairman Lu Chongzhi went to Shanghai to contact banks, financial institutions, and industrialists for loans, but waited in Shanghai for several months without results. The factory owes the Japanese Okura Trading Company more than three million yuan, and more than three million yuan of stock has fallen into Japanese hands, secretly controlled by the Japanese. It has no ability to recover, and the Japanese creditors are pressing for payment, so there are discussions of selling. The Kanebo Textile Company is in the process of buying it, and the terms have been agreed upon. The approximate price is 3.3 million yuan, which, after offsetting debts, leaves nothing. The Kanebo Textile Company is preparing to complete the takeover of the factory this month and start production next month. Yuyuan is the largest of the six yarn factories in Beiyang, with a capital of five million yuan and 30 years of operation. The main factory is divided into four branch factories: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, with 70,000 spindles. Although the machines are old, they are sturdy and durable. If managed properly, it can still be successful. Now it has been bought by the Japanese, which is a great loss to the industrial circles of North China.</p>
<p>The Toyo Textile Company is not only buying existing yarn factories in Tianjin, but also plans to build a large yarn factory with 150,000 spindles in Tianjin. It has acquired two plots of vacant land in the Fourth Special District of Tianjin (former Belgian Concession), each about a hundred acres, located in front of the Fourth Special District Public Office, to the left and right of the Texaco Petroleum Storage. The company acquired them at a low price and has completed all the formalities. Construction is scheduled to begin on April 15th and be completed by the end of this year. The first installation will be of 50,000 spindles, and 5,000 hardworking and enduring male and female workers will be recruited from Dalian to engage in spinning. At the same time, the company will continue to buy land and continue to build, aiming to reach the capacity to accommodate 150,000 spindles. According to the observation of the Japanese textile industry, the yarn sales in North China are very good, and the cotton production is also rich. If managed legally, Japanese merchants can monopolize the sales markets in the five provinces.</p>
<p>The Cultural Enterprise Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to help the Japanese yarn industry extend its influence in North China, is cooperating with the South Manchuria Railway Company to invest in eastern Hebei and Jiaodong, providing farmers with cash and lending 100,000 catties of cotton seeds from the Korean Governor-General's Office to supply agricultural use and experiment with improved cotton planting, so as to facilitate the supply of raw materials. Recently, the puppet Hebei (East) government is also renting a thousand acres of land in Tongxian to experiment with planting cotton, probably also to supply raw materials. (6th)</p>
<h3>Bubbling Poisonous Atmosphere in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Smokers Consume Two Thousand Yuan Daily; A Detoxification Center Established to Thoroughly Eradicate the Problem</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In recent years, white powder has become exceptionally prevalent in Bengbu. Unscrupulous merchants and local ruffians secretly transport and sell it for people to smoke, profiting from it. This type of drug, originally called heroin, is known as "Lao Hai" among Anhui people. It is purely extracted from the essence of opium, and its harm is extremely severe. It can not only lead to national ruin but also to the extinction of the race. Bengbu is a den of iniquity in northern Anhui, and the number of degenerate individuals addicted to this bad habit is increasing daily. Furthermore, some members of the underworld, tired of the old, are turning to white powder. Initially, smokers believe it is cheaper and more convenient than opium, but after prolonged addiction, the opposite is true. Those deeply addicted develop an earthy complexion and, at most, die from the drug within four or five years. It is impossible to avoid the destruction of life and the weakening of the race, harming the country and the people. There is truly nothing more egregious than this. According to those concerned about the poisonous atmosphere, it is estimated that no fewer than three thousand people in Bengbu consume this type of drug, spending approximately two thousand yuan daily, amounting to over seven hundred thousand yuan annually. The wealthy drug dealers have been known as the "Four Great Kongs," and there are numerous individuals secretly engaged in retail sales. Although military and police agencies occasionally make arrests, the traffickers, unafraid of the law, continue to take risks and transport drugs as before. To thoroughly eradicate drugs, the Public Security Bureau has established a detoxification center, sending arrested addicts for compulsory detoxification. After their addiction is broken, they are released only after providing a written guarantee promising to accept the death penalty if they relapse. If sellers are apprehended, they are sent to the Fengyang County Government to be severely punished according to the drug prohibition regulations. Although the authorities strictly prohibit drugs, the number of smokers and sellers has not decreased, which is a great concern for the future of our people. (April 8)</p>
<h3>Two Hunan and Hubei Supervisory Envoys Secretly Investigate Wuhan Dike Defenses</h3>
<p>Letters Sent to Responsible Agencies Urging Attention</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: As the spring flood season approaches, the water level in the Yangtze and Han Rivers is rising daily. According to the Jianghan Customs water level mark, it rose another 1.2 meters yesterday, the 7th, totaling 4.2 meters in the past week, equivalent to over ten English feet. All provincial and local dikes are being hastily reinforced by the responsible agencies. The Two Hunan and Hubei Supervisory Envoy's Office, mindful of the devastation caused by last year's floods, recognizes that this year's major flood season is rapidly approaching. Many dikes and embankments have not been repaired or are unlikely to be completed on time. In addition to dispatching personnel to various locations for investigation, the office has specially assigned counselors to secretly investigate the condition of dikes and embankments in Wuhan. The current investigation reveals the situation of important dikes and embankments in Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou. Letters have been sent to the responsible agencies urging them to expedite construction. In Wuchang, the body of the Wuhui Dike is mostly composed of sand. Areas where the Shi Dike's slope is damaged should be repaired as soon as possible to prevent wave erosion. Particular attention should be paid to the Tangfang section of the dike, where the dike foot is hollow. It is hoped that the responsible parties will gather funds and begin construction as soon as possible. An inquiry has been sent to the Wuchang County Government, requesting their attention. In Hankou, the Changfeng North and South Embankments have 22 major and minor breaches in the South Embankment, and dike funds have not yet been secured. The North Embankment has 21 major and minor breaches and is still being piled. These two embankments are crucial to the safety of Hankou and urgently need repair. Letters have been sent to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the Hankou Municipal Government for inquiry. In Hanyang, the breaches in the Yongfeng Embankment should be repaired as soon as possible. The Provincial Government has been requested to expedite construction. (April 7)</p>
<h3>The Social Foundations of Fascism (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— By Joseph Barncs, Translated by Bu Ren</p>
<p>Naturally, they view fascism as a genuine social revolution, as a doctrine that shifts power from one class to another or to the state. They anticipate that the middle class, in the initial compromise with big capital, will have sufficient strength and vitality. They fantasize that, at some point, the development of national ideals will lead to the nationalization of all these enterprises. Many of fascism's slightly mystical aspects, and its emphasis on the efficiency of war, are clearly intended to create a mass conception of loyalty to the nation. The ultimate concrete plans of the ruling nation, whether in Italy or Germany, are not yet clear. Fascism and National Socialism's disdain for plans and the frank opportunism of theory are inevitably subject to such criticism.</p>
<p>From the socialist perspective, all of this is pure posturing. Strachey, in his "The Nature of Capitalist Crisis," states: "Fascists consider themselves an independent class force based on the petty bourgeoisie. This entire concept is completely fictitious. In reality, fascism is always and everywhere a tool, not belonging to the petty bourgeoisie, which uses big capitalists as its unwitting allies, but to the big capitalists, who use the petty bourgeoisie as fools."</p>
<p>Socialists point out that fascism has never "held" power in any country; its power was given by capitalist powers when they needed to recruit agitators and private armies to maintain their collapsing position. This view sees fascism as a sinister special tool used by financial and industrial imperialists.</p>
<p>Between these two extreme interpretations of the social foundations of fascism, there is no compromise or sound explanation. Liberals and democrats also fail to see the means and the ends; they begin with preconceived notions about the terror and dictatorship spread by fascism, and the resulting analysis has nothing to do with the implicit political cooperation that is involved. Because this is not a theological issue, nor a matter of logic, but a movement issue, a socio-economic issue, that guides civilized people to exercise or accept certain political behaviors.</p>
<p>The fascists themselves do not provide much clarification on this issue. As they themselves say, they are focused on creating history rather than writing it. The British fascist—and also a shrewd historian—Arendt addresses Strachey's argument with a dismissive tone. At the same time, he himself proposes an interpretation of fascism. In the writings most sympathetic to fascism, his words can be described as one of the most typical. He said: "In the current critical moment when the speed of the crisis is awakening the people, fascism is appealing equally to two kinds of people, one is the middle class, who is temperamentally conservative and spiritually has a strong national idea of the will of the young, and the other is a more innovative view, and will be disappointed and angered by the left-wing leaders who can not achieve their wishes of the fewer, more active individuals."</p>
<p>Although these words are very vague, they reveal many questions that must be answered before one can guess the viability of fascism and whether it is suitable for other countries. Is the passion behind the fascist movement entirely composed of amplifiers and salute exercises? Can the abandoned middle class finally organize itself and gain power? Although the middle class has not played the role of the ruling class in Western European society for more than a hundred years, has it spread its ideals and its values so widely that monopolists still dream of becoming small capitalists?</p>
<p>The final answer to these questions should be given by fascism itself. It depends on how it chooses between the small citizens who vote for it and the bankers and industrialists who support it, or how it succeeds in avoiding a choice.</p>
<p>Countries that have not yet tested fascism can get a relatively quick answer. This answer must be based on a more thorough study and analysis of the middle class than is currently common. This analysis, first, will rewrite the history of the middle class, especially in relation to the capitalist class and the proletariat. Second, it will expose the roots of the economic power of the middle class, and will understand how the vitality of the middle class is expanding through commercial or geographical boundaries. Without such an analysis, even the terminology of fascism cannot be used as a reliable tool for making people aware.</p>

<p>District One Prepares to Dredge the City River</p>
<p>The city river in this county was dredged last year under the auspices of the Chenghuang Dredging River Committee. However, due to various complications, three sections were left uncompleted. After Magistrate Li took office, he immediately transferred the Dredging Committee to the First District Office, ordering them to prepare for the work. He also dispatched the chief of the Third Section to survey the main and tributary river channels, draw up charts, and issue orders for implementation. The First District Office has now invited bids for dredging. The river channel from Fenghuangshan Bridge outside the West Gate to Bailongtan River is estimated to be 3123.75 cubic meters of earth, the bottom of Hulong Bridge and the Hetai Weir River is estimated to be 569.25 cubic meters of earth, the power company to the West Suspension Bridge is estimated to be 1698 cubic meters of earth, the West Suspension Bridge to Fenghuangshan Bridge River is estimated to be 2805 cubic meters of earth, and the West Shuiguan Bridge to Tao Xing Bridge is estimated to be 7486.9 cubic meters of earth.

<p>Lascivious Monk Dies of Illness in Mistress's Home</p>
<p>Hengpei, the abbot of Chao Guo Temple, was over thirty years old and fond of women. He had two mistresses in Songjiang.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Boat Capsizing Tragedy Occurs at Jian Shan Lake</p>
<p>Dianshan Lake, located near Jinjiazhuang in the Fifth District of the county, spans over six li. Due to continuous strong winds, a boat capsizing tragedy occurred around 7 PM on the 8th. Over thirty boats sank, mostly stone boats. Countless people drowned.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Lawyer He Qi Released on Bail in Suzhou</p>
<p>Since assuming office, Zhu Shusheng, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, has had an excellent reputation. However, in February of this year, he was attacked by Zhu Xiongwu, a former clerk of the Jiangsu High Court who had been dismissed from his position, and others, in the name of the Jiangsu Judicial Improvement Association, who printed and distributed a large number of pamphlets. After investigation, it was discovered that Zhu Xiongwu and others were responsible. The High Procuratorate dispatched a prosecutor to search Zhu Xiongwu's residence and discovered evidence of bribery and malpractice during Zhu Xiongwu's tenure. Zhu Xiongwu was handed over to the Wuxian District Court Procuratorate for investigation. After the investigation by Prosecutor Lü, Chen Chaozan, a former clerk of the Qingjiangpu First Branch Court, and lawyer Lu Wenguang were also arrested and detained on suspicion. Chen Shitao, a criminal court judge of the Wuxi County Court, was also suspected of accepting bribes and was ordered to be released on bail. Various related parties were summoned for interrogation multiple times. On the afternoon of the 8th, Ji Yunqing and others from Wuxi were summoned for investigation, asked about everything, and then ordered to return. It was then learned that lawyer He Qi, residing at No. 98 Garden Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, Shanghai, was also a major suspect. A secret telegram was sent to the Shanghai Second Special District Court to arrest He Qi. On the night of the 8th, He Qi was escorted from Shanghai to Suzhou. Upon arrival at the District Court, because it was too late, no one was responsible, so he temporarily stayed at the Jingde Road Garden Hotel that night. On the morning of the 9th, he was escorted to the District Court, where Prosecutor Lü opened court for investigation, ordering him to be released on bail after providing a guarantor. It is said that the reason for He Qi's arrest was that the correspondence between He Qi and Chen Chaozan seemed to be related. He had been summoned twice, but He refused to appear, so he was arrested.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Li Genbao Arrested. Li Genbao, a notorious bandit from Taihu, a native of Shuzhuang, committed numerous crimes in the lakeside villages. In November of last year, the thirteen major robbery cases in Manshan, Taihu, were also committed by this bandit and his gang. The search and arrest were unsuccessful. Zhou, the district chief of the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau, had consulted with the Wujiang and Wuxi counties and instructed the water police under his jurisdiction to strictly apprehend the bandit. Shao, the captain of the investigation team of the Wujiang Branch Public Security Bureau, learned that the bandit was hiding in Dongshan, Dongting. He immediately dispatched detectives and successfully captured the bandit, escorting him to the team headquarters. According to the interrogation, he confessed to robbing Zhou Pinzhang's family in Dongshan, obtaining over a thousand yuan to share, and admitted to robbing Manshan and other places. He was sent to the Wujiang County Government on the 9th and will be sent to the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau within days for interrogation.</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle in Heavy Storm</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Corrections to the Land Survey Notice</p>
<p>Citizens Ye Lifeng and Zhu Sishi of Liantang, Daxiao Zheng, and others in the Third District of Qingpu submitted a petition to Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: The Qingpu County Land Bureau has made numerous errors in handling the land survey, making registration impossible. For example, the notice only has the new number and no old number, making it impossible for people to verify, mistake one. Also, the boundaries of the land are not filled in, or if they are, they do not match the fish-scale register, mistake two. Also, the land in Figure 58 of District 3, Ward 41, was mistakenly entered into Figures 53 and 54, causing confusion and making it impossible to investigate, mistake three. Also, some notices write Fengjing Xu, and some write Liantang Xu, but Fengjing and Liantang are both town names and not Xu names. Such carelessness makes it difficult for people to register. We are now planning remedial measures and request that the County Bureau correct the notices, based on the fish-scale register and the Qingpu County Continued Records, which contain the boundaries of the Figures and Xu and the old numbers, and send them again to facilitate registration.</p>

<h3>Garrison Command Orders Proclamation Urging Smokers to Register Universally. This is a Special Measure During the Reporting Period</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command recently received a telegram from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Chief Prohibition Commissioner, Chiang, on the prohibition methods of February 25, stating: The purpose of organizing smoker registration was to obtain accurate statistics in order to determine the standards for phased prohibition. However, since the end of registration at the end of last year, many cases of private opium smoking have occurred in various places, proving that the smoker registration conducted in various provinces, cities, and counties still has omissions. Therefore, the Measures for Reporting Smoker Registration have been specially formulated, and in February, the general principles of reporting and the strict enforcement of registration were ordered. Now, to implement the meaning of reporting and promote universal registration, it is specifically stipulated that provincial, city, and county governments, garrison security commands, and other military agencies authorized to conduct military trials, for cases of private opium smoking discovered since January 1 of this year, that have already been sentenced, regardless of whether they have been executed or not, or that have not yet been approved, should uniformly revoke the original judgment. All cases that have been discovered but not yet sentenced should be ordered to register in accordance with Article 3 of the Measures for Reporting Smoker Registration, exempt from punishment, and released immediately after registering and receiving a license to avoid unnecessary burdens. This is a special measure during the reporting period. After the reporting is completed, the procedures for handling cases of private opium smoking will be ordered separately. In addition to sending a telegram, the Geng telegram and reporting measures are attached for immediate compliance and to be forwarded to subordinates for strict compliance. After receiving the order, Commander Yang, in addition to complying, promulgated it on the 8th for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Garrison Command Releases a Large Number of Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>A Last Opportunity for Self-Renewal. Ordered to Re-Register, Temporarily Provide a Guarantee and Release. The Public Security Bureau Discusses General Reporting Steps Yesterday Morning. Dagong Society Reports: The Songhu Garrison Command, to give opium smokers a last opportunity for self-renewal, specially obtained approval from the Military Affairs Commission to release over 300 opium offenders in detention with lighter circumstances on bail, returning them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for re-licensing. The city's general reporting of opium smokers was discussed yesterday morning to proceed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overcrowding in Detention Centers</p>
<p>The city's opium prohibition work, since its beginning on July 1 of last year, has been carried out diligently by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in accordance with the Military Affairs Commission's opium prohibition measures, divided into voluntary and compulsory periods. Over 30,000 people have registered. Since the registration deadline, strict investigation work has been carried out, breaking over 300 opium dens and arresting over 800 opium offenders. All have been interrogated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for judgment and detention. However, the Garrison Command, due to limited detention center space, has caused overcrowding of opium offenders, resulting in difficulties in detention. The details have been reported to the Military Affairs Commission for review and handling.</p>
<p>Opium Offenders Renew Themselves</p>
<p>The command recently received an order from the Military Affairs Commission regarding the release of detained opium offenders who have been sentenced or not, returning them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for re-licensing and registration, temporarily providing a guarantee and releasing them. The command has now released over 300 male and female opium offenders with lighter circumstances, returning them to the Public Security Bureau to handle the re-licensing procedures. Those with more serious crimes will be transferred to detoxification centers for detoxification, then released with a guarantee. This is giving opium offenders a last opportunity for self-renewal. If they are arrested a second time or reported by someone and the results of the investigation show that they are still smoking opium, they will be punished by military law.</p>
<p>Discussion of Reporting</p>
<p>Since the Regulations for Reporting Opium Smokers were issued by the Opium Prohibition Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, the Opium Prohibition Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau convened a meeting of all personnel at 10 AM yesterday to study each article of the reporting regulations and formulate implementation steps. The general reporting period will begin within days.</p>
<p>Random Checks at Any Time</p>
<p>In recent days, the city's military and police authorities have intensified their work on the opium prohibition movement. The methods for reporting opium smoking by personnel of various agencies, public officials, and staff of mass organizations are also detailed in the reporting regulations. The first step is to request various agencies and organizations to report voluntarily, and then give them a considerable amount of time to quit smoking. Then, random checks will be conducted at any time. If they are found to be smoking again, they will be dismissed and punished.</p>

<h3>Minister of Railways Zhang Gongquan Publishes Reflections on Inspecting the Southwest Railways - Direct Access to Guangzhou Possible in the Second Half of Next Year - Guangxi's Poverty Promotes Its Progress</h3>
<p>Minister of Railways Zhang Gongquan recently returned to his department after inspecting the Southwest railways. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency obtained his officially published reflections on the inspection as follows: This time, I traveled from Hangzhou to Guangzhou to inspect the railways, spending a total of 21 days on the round trip. Before starting the journey, I had the following hopes: (1) How should we prepare in the future to achieve the goal of direct through train service from Shanghai to Guangzhou? After the inspection, I feel that if there are no unexpected obstacles to the current plan, it can be achieved in the second half of next year. The Qiantang River Bridge is expected to be completed around April or May next year. The bridge construction project had many concerns in the past, but now it is largely not a problem. After the completion of the Qiantang River Bridge, it is hoped that the Yuping Railway can be connected to the Yuehan Railway in June next year. However, at the same time, the light rail section of the Hangjiang line must be replaced with heavy rail. The connection project between the two lines in Hangzhou must also be carried out in parallel in order to realize the hope of direct access between Guangdong and Shanghai. This inspection is intended to contact all parties so that various matters can be prepared quickly and completely. (2) The Yuehan Railway is currently divided into three sections: Xiang-E, Zhu-Shao, and Guang-Shao. However, if it is still divided into separate sections after the upcoming opening to traffic and cannot be managed jointly, it will not only be uneconomical but also difficult to unify management and external relations. Therefore, I went to various provinces to discuss with the local authorities so that they could understand the matter of consolidation. When I arrived in Xiang-E, I first consulted with the two chairmen of the Hubei and Hunan provincial governments. When I arrived in Guangdong, I consulted with Commander-in-Chief Chen. The results were extremely satisfactory. All parties deeply understand the importance of railways to the country and greatly support the unified management of the Yuehan Railway. Therefore, in the near future, the three sections of the Yuehan Railway can be merged into one. Therefore, I have the following reflections: (1) Railways can promote mutual understanding and consensus, and create close relationships between provinces. If the railway crosses several provinces, it is always hoped that they will have the same concept of the railway and cherish it. In the past, various provinces did not understand the railway very well, and there were cases of acting independently. This was the case in Xiang-E, and also in Guang-Shao. The Ministry believes that the provinces cannot cooperate. In fact, we are running the railway business to assist the unity and close relationship of the provinces. The railway authorities cannot think that the responsibility is completed after the construction of the railway. They should still make the provinces understand that the railway is an organization to help communication and unification. Therefore, after the completion of the railway, the Ministry must explain to various places so that there is no separation between provinces and between provinces and the central government. Not only is the flow of goods and passengers smooth, but also the spirit between provinces and between provinces and the central government is communicated, so that it can fulfill its mission. Otherwise, if they each have their own interests and cannot cooperate, it will greatly hinder the future of the railway business. We should help the local authorities to eliminate this kind of obstacle. This is the responsibility of the Ministry and the directors of various railway bureaus, and it is also the biggest reflection after my observation and return. (2) There are too many staff members in various railways. This is because the directors of the bureaus have often been replaced in the past. New directors must use a batch of new people, but the old ones are not easy to remove, and they accumulate more and more. At the same time, their backgrounds are different, so it is impossible for them to fully understand the unified thinking and spirit of the national railway. The thoughts of railway employees across the country are different, so the management and reform plan of the railway are not easy to promote, and training cannot be completed in one day. Then, how to unify their thoughts and spirits? The only way is to personally visit and contact the personnel of each bureau to make their thoughts and spirits change considerably. This is the second point that I feel is necessary to go out for inspection. (3) After this inspection, I feel more deeply the importance of railway construction in our country. The provinces I passed through are all poor and financially exhausted. Even if water conservancy is handled or rural loans are released, the benefits of rural restoration are extremely slow. The agricultural products produced locally are inherently low in value, and it is impossible to transport them by expensive automobiles. Those with more goods are abandoned on the ground, and those with shortages buy goods at high prices. May I ask, in this situation, how can the living conditions of farmers be improved? The so-called method of improving the living conditions of farmers, in addition to raising the prices of agricultural products, there is no more effective method. If we rely on currency to raise prices, China has not yet reached this level. Therefore, only by expanding sales channels and reducing transportation costs can we implement the most basic and universal methods. In the past, Hengzhou eggs were sold for 17 cents per hundred, but now they are sold for more than 40 cents. The reason for the increase in sales price is that the railway has been opened and sales channels have been expanded. From this, we can see that if we want to increase the prices of agricultural products and improve the living conditions of farmers, the quickest and most convenient method is to use the railway. (4) The large-scale production in the southwestern provinces, in addition to agricultural products, is minerals. The development of minerals is originally a source of wealth, but if there is a lack of railway transportation, the output is too large to generate profits. In the southwestern provinces, it is impossible to develop agricultural products at present, but if minerals are developed without railway transportation, not only will the products not have sales channels, but also the development equipment will not be imported. Therefore, I believe that railway construction is extremely related to the recovery of the southwestern economy. In the southwestern provinces, it is really necessary to quickly build railways. At the same time, I feel that future route surveys cannot be based on population, cities, and terrain as the main basis for route surveys. We must develop a certain industry as the standard for route surveys, and we must also consider the economic, national defense, and industrial plans of the entire country, so as to avoid the future being considered inconsistent with the economic plan, re-transforming it, and wasting resources. Therefore, in the future, which province should develop industry, which province should develop agriculture, and which province should develop mining, we must first determine the entire plan, and then the route survey and construction of the railway will have a basis. Therefore, we should have a full understanding and preparation for this view and plan. (5) There are too many personnel in various railways. If we want to reduce them, the cost will be too high, and it will be difficult to continue. The only way is to build more new roads and allocate and transfer the original personnel, which is enough to remedy the disease of overstaffing, and can also conform to the purpose of selecting people for the job, and the adverse phenomena caused by layoffs will not be discovered. In the future, each railway bureau should determine the number of employees, and no arbitrary increase is allowed beyond the number. When there are vacancies in the original personnel, they must not be replenished. At the same time, new roads should use old railway personnel as much as possible. According to this plan, after several years, the personnel and funding problems of the railway may be completely resolved. In addition, after inspecting the two Guangdong provinces, I feel that Guangdong has recently been striving to develop economic construction, and there are many factories established, such as chemical industrial factories, sugar factories, and other industries, but they are all in their infancy. It will take a long time to see the results. The province's economy was difficult last year, but fortunately, overseas Chinese benefited more from the increase in tin prices in Nanyang, so more remittances were sent to Guangdong, which was enough to make up for it slightly. Otherwise, the local economic situation may be more difficult. From an objective point of view, the local taxes in Guangdong Province are too heavy. The provincial government is now trying to remedy it. The only advantage of Guangxi is diligence and thrift. Everyone who goes to Guangxi says that Guangxi is progressing. I don’t know that the reason for its progress is entirely due to poverty. The provincial government's annual income is 30 million yuan (silver dollars), only one-tenth of that of Guangdong. In addition, there is an annual trade deficit of more than 20 million yuan, and its economic and financial difficulties can be known. Therefore, Guangxi cannot but strive to survive in this difficult and difficult environment. When I went to Nanning, I did not see anyone wearing silk clothes or foreign clothes. Therefore, I believe that poverty can promote the progress of a province. The policies and goals implemented by Guangxi are all in line with the Central New Life Movement and the policies established by the Central Government. If those who serve in the Central Government can recognize that our situation has also reached the point of poverty, then progress will be faster. In short, our central government is now living on debt, and has a spirit of working hard in poverty, then the railway business will definitely have great progress. Extending it, if all departments have such ideas, are content with poverty, and are brave enough to work hard, then the central government will definitely prosper, and the progress of the national politics and economy will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Establishment Meeting of the Ministry of Industries' Fish Market Today</h3>
<p>Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Preside Over the Election of Directors, Supervisors, and Managers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industries' Fish Market, after negotiations between Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries and Mr. Duesheng, a fish merchant in this city, decided to jointly operate it by officials and merchants. There were twists and turns due to misunderstandings in the Ice-Fresh Fishery Association. After mediation by gentry and merchants, the association's sympathy was obtained, and the shares were fully paid up. The establishment meeting will be held today. Minister Wu, accompanied by the Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and will attend to preside over the meeting. According to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Principle of Joint Operation by Officials and Merchants Decided</p>
<p>The opening of the fish market has been delayed due to changes in the business model. Recently, Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with fish merchant leader Du Yuesheng and others and decided to jointly operate it by officials and merchants. The capital was fixed at 1.2 million yuan, half from officials and half from merchants. The subscribers of merchant shares are the Ice-Fresh Fishery Association and the River-Fresh Fishery Association, each for 50,000 yuan, non-fishery merchant shares for 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 300,000 yuan will be temporarily paid by the Ministry of Industry and gradually transferred. Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi were elected as representatives to negotiate separately.</p>
<p>Ice-Fresh Fishery Agrees to Cooperate</p>
<p>The members of the Ice-Fresh Fishery Association initially expressed their unwillingness to cooperate because they were concerned that their own business would be affected, which led to the resignation of the association's president, Du Yuesheng. After emergency consultation by the association, they earnestly retained him. Gentlemen and merchants, such as Yu Yanfang and Fang Jiaobo, invited the managers of various fish shops to talk a few days ago and explained in detail, and they were sympathetic and agreed to cooperate, and each shop voluntarily subscribed for 20,000 yuan of shares. The remaining 30,000 yuan was supplemented by borrowing the association's property. However, the association requested that the business rules of the market be discussed in detail and that the interests of the fish shops be taken into account, which was also accepted by Yu et al., and it was decided to unanimously advocate when discussing the detailed rules.</p>
<p>Fish Industry Conference Advocates Six Points</p>
<p>The association, for the sake of its own interests, held a meeting yesterday and decided on six points to notify the members, solicit their opinions, so as to practically advocate at the shareholders' meeting, and request that clear provisions be added to the detailed rules. The original text of the six points is as follows:  The 100,000 yuan owed by the fish market to the Bank of Communications, which is transferred to the association for approval, although there are fish market shares as collateral, is still the responsibility of each member. The shareholders of the fish shops now have the intention of closing down the joint venture fish shops from time to time. It is feared that it will be difficult to agree to solicit consent on this issue.  In addition to the shares that each member has subscribed for, the number is insufficient, and it is jointly agreed to maintain the previous proposal and supplement it by borrowing funds from the public office property.  The fish market should set up a branch market in the original 16 shops in the fish market center and designate each fish shop as a market affairs officer. All fish should be handled by the market affairs officer fish shop to exercise its powers.  Preserve the original loan distribution and sales business of each fish shop. The fish shop exercises its duties as a market affairs officer, limited to 23 companies, and no more will be added in the future.  The method of buying and selling is still the original method of successive buying and selling.  No matter how the commission is stipulated, each fish shop must still enjoy the original 8%, but the commission for fresh and salted boats will still be handled according to the current commission deduction.</p>
<p>Minister and Director Come to Shanghai to Preside Over</p>
<p>According to reporters from the Central News Agency, the market has determined that the merchant shares are 300,000 yuan, which has been fully collected by the Bank of China, and the official shares of 600,000 yuan have also been paid, and the 300,000 yuan of merchant shares to be paid have also been allocated. Therefore, Xu Tinghu, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry, was dispatched to Shanghai one day in advance to arrange the meeting, and Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Director Xu also had a talk with the merchant shareholders Yu Qiaqing, Yu Yanfang, Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Shenzhi, etc. yesterday afternoon and decided to hold the establishment meeting at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Directors and Supervisors Can Be Elected Immediately</p>
<p>The fish market was previously decided to be handled by the Ministry, and the Ministry had appointed directors and managers. Now that the organization has changed, the former manager Yu Kaizhan has resigned and is rushing to hand over. The shareholders' meeting will elect directors to take over. According to the new organization regulations, there are 11 directors, 6 appointed by the Ministry and 5 elected by the merchants. Although the merchant shares have not been fully collected, the distribution of the number of directors will not be changed. The selection of the manager must also be decided by the board of directors. The number of supervisors remains the same as originally determined, with 3 appointed by the Ministry and 2 elected by the merchants. The above-mentioned directors, supervisors, and managers will be elected at the establishment meeting. As for the organizational outline and business rules, they will be approved by the board of directors and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for promulgation and implementation. Its official opening for business is not far away. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Muslim Groups Welcomed Ma Hongkui Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ma...Loved Religion and Country, Talked About...With the Country's Survival, Religion Survives</p>

The meeting commenced at 2 PM, with Li Yunsheng elected as the temporary chairman. He reported on the purpose of the meeting and delivered a welcoming speech, stating, "Today, the ten mosques of Shanghai are holding a welcome meeting for Chairman Ma. Chairman Ma has been leading troops for many years and has contributed to the party and the country. This goes without saying. However, Chairman Ma has also wholeheartedly supported religion, Shanghai, and various religious education, charity, and public welfare undertakings. Today's warm welcome is a sincere expression. We hope Chairman Ma will give us guidance." Ma Hongkui then gave a speech, saying, "Shanghai's co-religionists, I am truly undeserving of such kindness. However, in this time of national crisis, we are all citizens and should fulfill our duties to the country with a heart that loves religion, protecting the country. As they say, 'With the country's survival, religion survives; with the country's demise, religion perishes.' As the ancients said, 'If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?' I hope to encourage each other with you all." His words were extremely cautionary. Finally, Tie Jun and Ma Tianying also gave speeches. They then visited the newly built building, had some refreshments, and went to the Qinglian Street Muslim Association. After a meeting, the entire group took a photo and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Cai Zengji Discusses the Reform of River Steamers</h3>
<p>Implementing Ticket Sales at Docks and Limiting Ticket Numbers; Rectifying Sanitary Facilities and Improving Both Freight and Passenger Transportation</p>
<p>Since Cai Zengji took over as General Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been actively rectifying and sparing no effort. The reporter from Xinxin News Agency met with Mr. Cai yesterday, and he spoke in detail about the benefits of the company's reforms to passengers and merchants on the river steamers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Past Problems of River Steamers</p>
<p>Mr. Cai stated, "Since the company was ordered to reorganize, it has been implementing the Ministry of Communications' rectification plan step by step. Although there are many tasks and it is difficult to achieve success overnight, we are cooperating and working hard to achieve success day by day. The recent reform of river steamers is also one aspect of the rectification plan. In the past, ticket sales for river steamers were not restricted, and passengers often exceeded the number of berths by one or two times. In addition, scattered soldiers and undesirables were mixed in, smoking, gambling, and creating chaos. There was no order on the ship, let alone hygiene. Therefore, due to long-standing habits, the treatment of third-class passengers on river steamers was almost inhuman. Moreover, each ship had at least sixty or seventy teahouse waiters, and as many as one hundred and thirty or forty. The ship workers were not paid wages and relied entirely on privately selling berths and soliciting tips for their services. After purchasing tickets and boarding the ship, third-class passengers had to buy berths from the teahouse waiters before they had a place to rest. Even the official cabins with fixed berths often claimed that they were reserved to extort tips. As for tips for alcohol, they often amounted to more than 30% of the ticket price for long-distance trips, and were even equal to the ticket price for short trips. Outright extortion was rampant. All of these shortcomings were unique to river steamers. Anyone who has traveled on river steamers knows this in detail. Our company is a state-owned shipping agency, and at this time of vigorously promoting the New Life Movement, we must reform and innovate without hesitation."</p>
<p>Various Reform Measures</p>
<p>The various measures after the reform and the expectations for gradual implementation are briefly described as follows: 1. Implementing ticket sales at the docks. In addition to continuing to entrust reputable firms to act as ticket agents, the company will implement ticket sales at the docks in various ports from April 1st. Anyone who has not purchased a ticket will not be allowed to board the ship. From now on, scattered soldiers and undesirables will not be able to enter, and order on the ship will be easily maintained. The previous bad phenomena can be gradually eliminated. In addition, passengers can purchase tickets and board the ship upon arrival at the dock, so even tourists will not have the difficulty of not knowing where to go. They will not have to go through others and suffer unexpected losses. 2. Limiting the number of tickets to prevent overloading. If passengers exceed the number of berths, some passengers will pay the same price for tickets but will not receive the same treatment. Moreover, exceeding the number of people will be dangerous for navigation. Therefore, the number of tickets has been limited, and all berths will be numbered. The principle is that those who purchase a ticket will have a berth. Passengers will not be crowded, and they will not have to worry about not having a berth after purchasing a ticket. 3. Rectifying hygiene on the ship. After the first two items are implemented, passengers will feel comfortable. The company is also striving to rectify hygiene facilities and has invited members of the New Life Movement General Association to station on the ship for guidance to achieve cleanliness and order. This will definitely benefit the health of passengers. 4. Stipulating the salaries and tips for teahouse waiters and prohibiting greed. The drawbacks of hiring teahouse waiters without paying wages have already been described above. Therefore, the company is handling this in accordance with the labor service principle. All teahouse waiters serving on river steamers will be paid a considerable monthly salary so that their personal lives can be solved first. As for tips for alcohol, it will be up to the passengers, although the standard is stipulated to be 10% of the ticket price. However, there should be no dispute if less is given, and greed is absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Hoping for Cooperation from All Sectors</p>
<p>The above points are only a glimpse of the matters carried out after the reform. The company will definitely implement them one by one and maintain them forever to demonstrate the spirit of state-owned shipping and fulfill its duty to serve society. However, after limiting the number of tickets, the company will suffer great losses in competition with those who do not limit the number of tickets. All business personnel on the ships, from the chief of affairs to the teahouse waiters, will be paid salaries by the company, so the increase in expenses is a natural result. Therefore, the company bears a huge burden after the reform. The government is willing to make huge sacrifices for the sake of rectifying the shipping industry and seeking the interests of the majority. However, in order to gradually implement the government's rectification plan and promote state-owned shipping, it is hoped that patriotic people will rise up to assist and share the mission. Although the development of shipping companies in other countries is due to good management, how can they achieve this without the cooperation and support of people from all walks of life in their own countries? The reform of the company's river steamers is truly a firm intention to reform the business. In the future, improving freight transportation and rectifying warehouses and docks will be carried out continuously to live up to the expectations of those who care for the company. However, since the company has not hesitated to make huge sacrifices to carry out reforms, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will, with patriotic enthusiasm, extend their love to the company for the benefit of both freight and passengers, so that the company's business can develop day by day. Then, even if there are some sacrifices at present, it is hoped that the benefits will be reaped in the future. As for all the measures of the company, if passengers have any opinions, or if there are any oversights, it is hoped that they will teach us. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>The Spanish National Day Celebration on the 14th; The Spanish Consul-General Receives Officials from Various Countries</h3>
<p>The 14th of this month is the Spanish National Day. Mr. Ferlenlai, the Consul-General of that country in Shanghai, has specifically scheduled to hold a grand tea party at the Consulate-General at No. 1449 Avenue Joffre on the morning of that day, inviting officials from China and various countries to extend their congratulations, and convening expatriates to celebrate.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Responds to the Chamber of Commerce That Documents Internally Compiled Should Be Stamped, Distinguishing Between Scattered and Compiled Orders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt internal documents that do not create rights and obligations from stamp duty after they are used and compiled into a book. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Document No. 9145, stating, "Both telegraphs from Xian and Ma have been noted. Article 11 of the Stamp Duty Rate Table, under the nature column for books and registers used by businesses, stipulates that all general and branch books and registers established by shops or banks in relation to their business belong to this category. Moreover, Article 11 of the Detailed Rules stipulates that books and registers compiled from loose leaves should still be stamped according to the example for books and registers. The so-called books and registers refer to all books and registers related to business. The original article does not call them account books but books and registers, and the intention is here. If the documents used internally are bound into a book, then they are the same style and have the same effect as other books and registers, and they cannot be called books and registers that are not related to business. The previous approval of the Ministry for internal documents that are compiled into a book and stamped according to the example for books and registers is in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Stamp Duty Rate Table and Article 11 of the Implementing Rules, and is not an illegal collection. Moreover, the documents used internally are intended for notification or reporting when used individually, but after being compiled into a book, the purpose of use is to check the accounts, which is the same as the purpose of using books and registers. Since books and registers should be stamped before use, these documents should also be handled in the same way when compiled into a book, which is not in conflict with the provisions of Article 5 of the Stamp Duty Law. In short, there is no problem with internal documents that are compiled using paper wrappers or tied with rope, and are not made into the style of books and registers. Otherwise, they should still be handled according to the example for books and registers in order to prevent abuses. This approval is hereby transferred for your information."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Denies Ordering New Ships from Italy</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that a Japanese newspaper in this port reported that the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has ordered new ships from the Shanghai branch of the Italian Russell Terrier Ship Company, and that the contract has been established. According to the person in charge of the company yesterday, this is not true.</p>
<h3>The 54th Administrative Meeting of the Headquarters of the Aviation Association Mobilization Team</h3>
<p>The Headquarters of the Shanghai Mobilization Team of the China Aviation Association held its 54th administrative meeting at its office on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (8th) at 4:00 PM to discuss matters related to the ongoing mobilization for donations. Those present included Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Li Songtao, Lu Zhangyan, Yang Peiwen, Zhu Shengyang, Li Huiran, Huang Jun, and others. The chairman was Li Dachao, and the recorder was Chen Shuo. The chairman's report briefly stated that the association launched a campaign to raise funds for the purchase of aircraft to expand the patriotic aviation movement and celebrate Generalissimo Chiang's birthday. Provinces and cities have responded successively, and compatriots from all over the country and various agencies, organizations, and individuals in this city have enthusiastically donated to show their respect and support for the leader. The number of donations is increasing every day. In addition, many people with enthusiasm for social undertakings and reputable agencies, organizations, and individuals have been solicited as initiators to increase strength, and many have agreed to participate. Also, the special birthday congratulatory tickets are divided into Heaven, Earth, Middle, Righteousness, Peace, Prosperity, Longevity, Good Fortune, and Cross. Many groups, factories, and individuals have purchased them in recent days. The association has sent letters to each mobilization team leader to intensify mobilization and make efforts, and they are working hard to complete the mission as scheduled. The collection of patriotic aviation rescue funds from the civilian shipping industry was previously entrusted to Mobilization Team 441. Since starting in November of last year, the results have been mediocre for several months, and disputes have arisen repeatedly. In order to effectively rectify this, the office was moved to this office last month. Although shipowners are enthusiastically contributing, the wharf area is wide, and there may be omissions. A solution has been proposed and a letter has been sent to the Finance Bureau to collect funds on behalf of the association. A solution will be found soon. Other industries such as the hotel and restaurant industries are working very hard, and the mobilization results are excellent. Then, each field secretary reported on the progress of contact and inspection. Several fundraising proposals were discussed until the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. In addition, Lei Jichang and Wang Renshan of the Baoxing No. 2 Flour Mill in Bengbu donated one yuan and one jiao in national currency last month to support the patriotic aviation rescue movement. The headquarters of the mobilization team received another donation of one yuan and one jiao yesterday and has sent a letter of thanks. Also, the Birthday Celebration Committee received responses from Wang Xiaoying, Tang Naijian, Liu Qiman, Zhou Hanyi, and Cao Qinyu to the birthday celebration fundraising campaign, each sending one yuan in national currency. The committee has sent letters to express its thanks and requested that they make more efforts to promote the campaign. Furthermore, the Birthday Celebration Committee received a letter from the Shanghai Lingerie United Association yesterday, expressing its strong support for purchasing aircraft to celebrate Generalissimo Chiang's birthday. The association plans to request members of the industry and other industries to perform plays to raise funds for support. The committee has sent a letter praising their enthusiasm and asking them to proceed with their efforts immediately.</p>

All three qualities, according to Premier [Chiang Kai-shek], were inherent virtues of our country. In today's turbulent society, these virtues are perceived as unattainable. We, the survivors, must learn from him. Next, Lu Xuepu spoke, noting that Liang Shiyi had already been studying the national currency issue since the Era of the Three People’s Principles [early Republic of China period]. All the recent measures implemented had been considered by Liang at the time, demonstrating his great foresight and making him a visionary of his time.

<h3>Merchants Unite to Transport Less-than-Carload Freight; Shippers Now Responsible for Escorting Goods; Standardized Escort Measures Established</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Railways notes that practices vary across railway lines regarding whether shippers are responsible for escorting less-than-carload freight. This inconsistency creates difficulties in handling through freight. To facilitate merchants and promote through freight, standardized measures have been established. An order has been issued to inform all railway lines that, in accordance with Article 7 of the General Rules for Goods Transportation (except for flowers and trees), and in accordance with Business Circular Freight Category No. 12, goods transported with a minimum charge equivalent to 2,000 kilograms do not require an escort. The railway will take care of them along the way, but will not be responsible for losses. If the shipper applies and wishes to send an escort, it should be handled in accordance with Article 41 of the General Rules for Goods Transportation. The above measures will be implemented from May 1st of this year. It is reported that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have been ordered to instruct their traffic departments to comply.</p>

<h3>Young Couple Attempt Suicide Due to Love and Poverty</h3>
<p>Tan Shenghua and Wu Aifang Unable to Secure Betrothal Gifts Lead to Tragedy</p>
<p>The Wu Palace Hotel at 152 Fuzhou Road, Fujian Road, received a young couple the day before yesterday. They checked into the hotel together. The hotel clerk guided them to room 631. The man, who identified himself as Tan Shenghua, 23 years old, from this area, a businessman, and the woman, Wu Aifang, 18 years old, retired early that night. However, around 7 AM yesterday, the tea attendant heard cries coming from the room, mixed with vomiting. He knocked on the door, but received no response after a long time. Sensing something was wrong, he reported to the clerk, who managed to climb in through the transom window. He found both of them rolling in bed, their faces pale. The bedding was stained with blood and traces of poison. Two empty poison bottles were on the table next to the bed. Realizing they had attempted suicide by poison, he immediately reported to the police station and had them rushed to the hospital for treatment. Their conditions were critical. Police officers found a note left by the couple in room 631, which read, "Please notify Xu Shenshan of the International Telegraph Office immediately." Based on this note, the police began an investigation. It was learned that the man's name was indeed Tan Shenghua, residing at 1 London Road, Zhabei, and had worked for the Dada Automobile Company, a Japanese firm on Avenue Foch [now East Yan'an Road]. He had been unemployed since the January 28 Incident. The woman had studied at Deqing Girls' Primary School, residing at 4 Xiang'an Lane, Bao'an Road, Zhabei. The couple had known each other for a long time and had developed a close relationship. After their relationship was discovered by their parents, marriage was discussed. However, Tan was unable to afford the betrothal gifts due to financial difficulties. The woman's family repeatedly pressed for the gifts in the shortest possible time. Tan had no choice but to propose postponing the engagement, scheduled for February 23rd of this year. However, busybodies mocked him, claiming that Tan was intentionally delaying, intending to abandon her. The cold irony was jarring to the ear. Wu Aifang's parents were displeased and scolded their daughter. Feeling aggrieved, Wu ran away from home and went to Tan. After discussing the situation, they believed they would never be able to live together. The emotions of love and depression collided, leading to this tragedy. The poor customs drove two young people to resort to this drastic measure. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>The Franconia Carries World Cruise Members to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>A 144-Day Journey Through 19 Countries and 35 Ports</p>
<p>The Franconia, a British world cruise ship managed by Thos. Cook &amp; Son, belongs to the Cunard Line. The ship, with a gross tonnage of 20,000 tons, is equipped with unparalleled luxury. It has sailed on world cruises six or seven times. It departed from New York on January 7th, arriving at Le Brea, then proceeding to Brazil in South America, then Jamestown, and rounding the Cape of Good Hope to South Africa. It visited Madagascar and Sicily, then proceeded to Ceylon, the Dutch East Indies, and finally Hong Kong and Shanghai. The places it visited in Africa were rarely visited by previous cruises. This trip aroused the interest of adventure among the cruise members.</p>
<p>Delayed Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The ship was originally scheduled to arrive at Wusong on the night of the 8th, but was delayed due to fog at sea. It finally arrived at Wusong at 12:55 PM yesterday. Thos. Cook &amp; Son sent a pilot to guide the ship into the port. It berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 2:30 PM, twelve hours behind schedule. Three representatives from Thos. Cook &amp; Son also took a launch to Wusong to greet the cruise members and discuss the itinerary.</p>
<p>Sightseeing Itinerary</p>
<p>Three hundred and fifteen cruise members arrived, including the famous explorer Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke was most interested in this trip to South Africa. The ship docked at Gonghexiang Wharf at 2:30 PM yesterday. Thos. Cook &amp; Son had prepared a large number of cars, which transported the cruise members to various parts of the city and Jiangwan for sightseeing. In the evening, they had dinner at the Cathay Hotel. This morning, they boarded the ship to Qinhuangdao, visiting Tianjin and Beijing.

<h3>Gu Gengmei Sues Lin Xianglin for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Savings Book Deducted, Seventy Taels of Gold Embezzled; Lin Sends Defense Statement from Yongjia to Shanghai</p>
<p>Aftermath of Property Grab Case</p>
<p>Lin Xianglin, residing at 24 Qiantou, Yongjia County, Wenzhou, schemed to seize his uncle's inheritance. He fraudulently obtained a savings certificate worth $50,000 from his cousin Lin Xinying. Fearing that Lin Xinying's husband, Gu Gengmei, would interfere, he bribed Wang Rusong, an officer of the Yongjia Public Security Bureau, with $350. He also instructed Lin Xinying to falsely accuse Gu Gengmei of embezzlement at the Public Security Bureau. The case was discovered by the director of the bureau, who handed over Wang Rusong, Lin Xianglin, and others to the Yongjia District Court. After interrogation, Wang Rusong was sentenced to two years and six months in prison for accepting bribes. Lin Xianglin was sentenced to one year in prison for instigating false accusations. It has been learned that Gu Gengmei recently hired lawyer Liu Shifang to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Lin Xianglin of embezzlement. The main points of the lawsuit allege that the defendant, Lin Xianglin, is the cousin of Gu's wife, Lin Xinying. He had long coveted the assets of the plaintiff's mother-in-law and repeatedly sowed discord in front of Xinying. The plaintiff went to Wenzhou in the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] to serve as the director of the Ouhai Hospital and resided there with his wife. At the same time, he often went to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Visiting His Mother</p>
<p>The defendant took the opportunity to slander Xinying, falsely claiming that the plaintiff had an affair in Shanghai. Falling for the scheme, Xinying entrusted the defendant to come to Shanghai in November of last year, bringing back to Wenzhou the contract savings book seals stored at the Shanghai Bank and the Tongyi Trust Company. He also handed over the key to the safety deposit box at the Shanghai Bank and the seal used to open the box. The defendant arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of the same month and went to the Shanghai Bank and Tongyi Trust Company's safety deposit box to remove all the gold placed inside. This included a savings [amount] of $500 in the name of Gu Gengmei at the Continental Bank, two savings books in the name of Gu Gengmei at the Shanghai Bank, each with $500, and 70 taels, 1 mace, and 7 fen of gold, totaling $7,999.38 in national currency. This savings and gold were the plaintiff's private property and unknown to Xinying. Therefore, Xinying did not entrust him to bring them back. The defendant planned to embezzle them. He withdrew the savings and interest from the two banks.</p>
<p>Withdrew the Full Amount</p>
<p>(totaling $1,579.73 in national currency) and sold the gold. He never handed over the two items to Xinying. In February of this year, the plaintiff went to the Shanghai Bank to open the safety deposit box and found that the savings book and gold were gone. He learned that it was the defendant who had done it. His actions constitute the crime of embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Code. He requests judgment ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff $9,579.11 in national currency, plus interest. Yesterday afternoon, judge Zhan Liangce presided over the hearing of the case in the Ninth Criminal Court. Because the defendant's residence is</p>
<p>In Yongjia County</p>
<p>The summons entrusted the local district court there to cooperate with the summons. However, after receiving the summons, Lin Xiang [lin] did not surrender to the court, but delayed filing a defense statement, stating that the location where the case occurred was in Yongjia [county], and there are previous cases that can be [used]. Therefore, there are still questions regarding jurisdiction. Judge Zhan briefly questioned the plaintiff Gu Gengmei and the witness Lin Xinying and ordered the case to be rescheduled to await the summons of the defendant for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Requests Ban on Passengers Carrying Binoculars</h3>
<p>Included in the Ministry-Issued Regulations, Approved by the Ministry</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation to add a provision banning passengers from carrying binoculars to the passenger regulations issued by the Ministry. Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation issued approval No. 705, stating that the request to add a provision to the regulations banning aviation passengers from carrying binoculars is approved.

<h3>Fishing Disturbance in Yu Garden, Jiangwan</h3>
<p>One Person Caught Stealing Fish, Chinese Police Interfere, Over Ten Village Women Injure Police Officer</p>
<p>Last night at approximately 9 PM, the gardener of Yu Garden Fish Pond on Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, discovered villagers intruding to steal fish. He chased after them and apprehended one person on the spot, calling the police to take him to the station. A Chinese police officer from Hongkou Park interfered. At the same time, a village woman gathered a crowd of over ten people who blocked the road and acted violently. One police officer was injured. The men and women involved in the incident were detained and taken to the main station for investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Caught Stealing Fish</p>
<p>Yu Garden on Jiangwan Road is a private garden built by a Cantonese businessman named Deng. It has a fish pond where fish are raised and bred. This has attracted the covetousness of nearby villagers who often bring nets at night, climb over the fence, and steal fish. The garden caretaker, Yao Huaichuan from Xuzhou, was reprimanded by the garden owner. At around 9 PM last night, Yao discovered shadows moving in the fish pond, realizing that someone was stealing fish. He went to interfere. The villagers fled in a panic with their nets. Yao apprehended one person, Zhao Liansheng (17 years old) from Pudong, along with the nets. He called Gao Hehan, a police officer from the Jiangwan Road police station, intending to take him to the station for investigation. When they arrived at the garden gate, Chen Baozong (25 years old) from Jiading, who works as Chinese police officer No. 83 at Hongkou Park, suddenly interfered and spoke rudely. Officer Gao planned to take him to the station together.</p>
<p>Surrounded and Attacked En Route</p>
<p>As the group passed in front of 63 Garden, Wang Zhu Shi, the wife of Wang Abing, who runs a teahouse, gathered a crowd of over ten people carrying wooden sticks and rushed up to them, demanding that Officer Gao release Chen and Zhao. Officer Gao ignored them and was surrounded and attacked by the crowd, who tore his face and bruised his right [arm]. Yao was also injured on his fingers and face. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Officer Gao blew his whistle. Police officers from nearby posts rushed over, and the crowd dispersed. Only the village woman Wang Zhu Shi was arrested, along with Chen Baozong and Zhao Liansheng, and taken to the North Station Branch for questioning. It is reported that the bureau believes Chen and the other three men and women dared to assault police officers, were involved in theft, and are truly hateful. They will be sent to the main bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer He Qi Escorted to Suzhou</h3>
<p>Court Did Not Allow Bail</p>
<p>Lawyer He Qi, Zi Qingyuan, residing at 98 Garden Lane, Rue du Pere Robert, French Concession, once served as a judge in the Civil Division of the Shanghai First Special Court. Recently, a case involving Zhu Xiongwu and others suing for fraud and defamation in the Wu County District Court implicated Lawyer He, so the Wu County District Court telegraphed the Shanghai Second Special Court, which dispatched police officers to arrest Lawyer He the day before yesterday and escort him to the Second Special Court. After Judge Li Changnian questioned him, he ordered He Qi to provide two joint shop guarantees for release to surrender himself for questioning. As He [Qi] was finding guarantors, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court arrived and opposed bail, demanding that he be immediately transferred to custody. Lawyer He and his attorney Chen Chou repeatedly requested that he be allowed to surrender himself. As a result, Judge Li ordered court police officers Ji Shoubin and Pan Yuyi to escort He overnight to the Wu County Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Nanhui County Government Sued</h3>
<p>The County Government Did Not Punish the Deceased’s Estate for Short Payment of Public Funds After the Death of the Tax Collection Clerk</p>
<p>Guarantor Suffers and Seeks Legal Relief</p>
<p>Zhang Xiang Sheng from Datianzhu Village outside the East Gate of Nanhui County, Pudong, acted as guarantor for the late Pu Yansheng, who served as a tax collection clerk in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. According to regulations, a guarantee certificate was required. After Pu Yansheng died of illness, the Nanhui County Government calculated that Pu Yansheng was short 1,825 yuan in public funds and ordered Zhang to pay the compensation. Zhang argued that Pu Yansheng had land and property worth over 3,000 yuan, which was sufficient to cover the debt. He requested that the county government first dispose of the deceased Pu Yansheng's estate. If that was insufficient, the guarantor should then compensate for the remaining amount. However, the county government did not respond to his request and repeatedly sent officials to arrest Zhang Xiang Sheng and押交[unknown term], forcing Zhang to flee to Shanghai. He hired lawyer Yang Changchi to file a lawsuit with the Jiangsu High Court, seeking relief. The defendants are listed as the Nanhui County Government and Pu's heirs. The petition requests that the competent authorities be designated to hear the case. The High Court designated the Shanghai District Court to handle the case. Yesterday, Judge Han Jingdou opened the trial. Only Yang, Zhang's attorney, appeared in court. He stated that Zhang Xiang Sheng is 46 years old, from Nanhui, residing in Nanhui Sanguo Bajia. The plaintiff guaranteed that Pu Yansheng would act as a tax collection clerk in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], owing 1,825 yuan. However, the county government directly ordered the plaintiff to compensate. The principal debtor had 19.27 mu of land and 4.5 rooms, totaling over 3,000 yuan. The plaintiff repeatedly requested that the property of the principal debtor be disposed of first. However, the county government ignored this and insisted on arresting the plaintiff, violating Article 745 of the Civil Code. Therefore, the lawsuit requests that the Jiangsu High Court designate this court to hear the case. It also requests a judgment that Pu Yansheng's property be sealed and used to compensate first. If that is insufficient, the plaintiff will then supplement the amount. Finally, a declarative judgment is requested. The judge stated that the case requires investigation and ordered a future hearing.</p>
<h3>Salmon Tax Evasion Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Ye Zhenchang, owner of Zhenda Fish Firm; and Weng Zhaofang, shareholder and manager of Jieshun Salted Goods Firm in Xiaodongmen Xian Gua Street; and Zheng Yunsheng, manager of Shengji Salted Goods Firm in 16 Pu; along with Ye’s younger brother Ye Zhenqin and Zhang Benhua, were all reported by their colleagues Zhu Xusheng, Zhao Lianfang, and Chang Junfa to the Nanshi District Court last autumn. The report stated that Ye et al. had used fraudulent means to evade tariffs on over 6,700 dan of salmon shipped from Soviet Russia to Shanghai, with a tariff value of over 70,000 yuan, evading national taxes and violating serious laws. Fearing exposure and unforgiving judgment under law, they voluntarily surrendered themselves. Prosecutor Xiao investigated and found the accusations to be true, filing a public prosecution. Judge Wu Deying held numerous hearings, totaling over eight. Ye Zhenqin and Zhang Benhua avoided appearing and were ordered to be arrested. The defendants in court were thoroughly investigated, and arguments were concluded. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. The judge noted that the defendants are all reputable merchants who had accidentally violated the law, so the sentences were reduced. Ye Zhenchang was fined 1,000 yuan. Weng Zhaofang and Zheng Yuansheng were each fined 200 yuan. The informants Zhu Xusheng, Zhao Lianfang, and Chang Junfa were each reduced to a fine of 50 yuan, allowing them to reform. The trial against the fugitives Ye Zhenqin and Zhang Benhua was suspended until they are apprehended. After the verdict, the defendants' lawyers declared in court that they were dissatisfied. The judge stated that they could appeal according to the law after receiving the judgment.</p>
<h3>Sentence for Trafficking Narcotics</h3>
<p>Xu Shixun Sentenced to Twelve Years</p>
<p>The Puda Pharmaceutical Factory at 73, Lane 432, Avenue Petain, was opened by Yang Xinan (also known as Yang Jisheng) and specialized in producing and selling various pills and liquids containing potent narcotics. After testing by the Central Hygiene Experiment Institute in Nanjing, it was discovered that the medicines were adulterated with morphine. The Institute sent a letter to the Shanghai Health Bureau, which forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau, which instructed the police to arrest employees Xu Shidong and Yang Shouzhang at the Puyuan Pharmaceutical Factory. They confiscated products such as An Nao Bu Wan [Brain-Soothing Pills], Dwarf Gourd Essence, An Nao Bu Han [Brain-Soothing Sweating Pills], and Dwarf Gourd Pills. They were sent to the First Special Court. Xu was remanded in custody, and Yang was released on bail pending sentencing, as previously reported. The presiding judge Liu Yugui, because further investigation and evidence were needed, rescinded the conclusion of arguments. Yesterday morning, he presided over a further hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendants hired lawyers Chen Zhen and Shi Jiutang to defend them. Judge Liu announced the verdict in court: Xu Shixun is sentenced to twelve years in prison for continuously trafficking narcotics, and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. Yang Shouzhang is not guilty. Six boxes of Hundred-Supplement Holy Medicine, that is, Dwarf Gourd Pills, are confiscated and destroyed. The ledgers recording the Dwarf Gourd Pills are confiscated. The An Nao Wan, Dwarf Gourd Essence, and An Nao Juice, were examined by the Forensic Institute and found not to contain narcotics, and are to be returned.</p>

<h3>Special District Rickshaw Pullers Association: General Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussion on Assisting the Municipal Council in Re-registering Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>After the rickshaw merchants in the Special District requested the registration of rickshaw pullers, the Municipal Council agreed to re-register them. The Council specifically stipulated the re-registration method: one rickshaw allows for the recommendation of one puller, three rickshaws allow for two pullers, and for those with a large number of rickshaws, one puller is allowed for every two rickshaws. The registration will begin on the 14th. The Special District Rickshaw Pullers Association held a general meeting of its members at its office at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 90 people, including Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Wang Kunyi, Lu Dexing, and Qiu Jixiang, attended. Gu Songmao chaired the meeting and first reported on the results of the negotiations with the Municipal Council after the previous strike. The Association received a written notice from the Rickshaw Committee regarding the registration method. After discussion, it was resolved that: All rickshaw owners must guide unemployed rickshaw pullers to register as soon as the re-registration begins; To ensure that all rickshaw owners are aware of the re-registration, the Association will send letters to summon the directors of the five districts (Southeast, Northwest) to notify them separately. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. In addition, the Association sent a letter stating that Luo Jialun, president of National Central University, criticized the strike as inhumane to the rickshaw merchants. The Association clarified that it was forced to take such measures due to the Rickshaw Committee's repeated rent reductions and the difficulty of rickshaw pullers unwilling to pay mutual aid fees.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Weather Turned Cold</h3>
<p>Since Sunday, the weather has suddenly become hot, with the temperature rising to over 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Pedestrians on the street wore camel hair or cotton clothes again, otherwise, it would not be enough to keep warm.</p>
<h3>French Concession: Revised Method for Collecting House Tax</h3>
<p>When the Rental Amount Includes Water, Electricity, or Equipment, the House Tax Can Be Appropriately Reduced Proportionately</p>
<p>The house tax levied by the French Concession Municipal Council is fixed at 13% of the rent. The tax is collected based on the rent receipts issued by the landlords. In the past, there were no deductions or reductions for the benefits enjoyed by the tenants. Recently, the Council prepared its budget for this year and revised the house tax calculation method. If the rent is used as the basis for the rental value, the total amount of house tax will be reduced in proportion to the amount of benefits enjoyed by the tenants, such as: Rent including water supply should be reduced by 5%; Rent including electricity supply should be reduced by 5%; Rent including garbage incineration equipment should be reduced by 5%; Rent including heating or cooling equipment should be reduced by 10%; Rent including elevator equipment should be reduced by 10%. However, the total reduction due to the above benefits cannot exceed 30% of the total rent. Regarding houses with equipment, the reduction method should be determined by the Director of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council or his representative, based on the scale of the equipment enjoyed by the tenants. However, this reduction cannot exceed 15% of the net value of the rent after the reduction for the benefits enjoyed by each tenant.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Cables Request to Postpone Relocation of Tombs in Ningbo City</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Unscrupulous People from Excavating and Correct the County Government's Relocation Announcement</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reported that Yu Hede, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, was concerned that the Yinxian County Government in Zhejiang Province had set a deadline for the demolition and relocation of all tombs in Ningbo City, causing the people to be at a loss. He telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and Zhao Cisheng, Commissioner of the Yinxian Administrative District, requesting them to consider the difficult situation and quickly correct the situation.

<p>Telegram to Chairman Huang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province Chairman Huang Junjian, As reported, the Yinxian County Government announced that all existing tombs, floating coffins, and exposed coffins in the Ningbo city area must be demolished and relocated before May 10th. It is understood that the relocation of floating coffins and exposed coffins has long been implemented in Ningbo City. As for the existing tombs, there are registered regulations, and it is not appropriate to include them indiscriminately, which may cause disputes. In recent days, in rural areas outside the railway and provincial road areas, unscrupulous people have taken the opportunity to excavate tombs for profit, which is inhumane and has aroused public resentment. Therefore, we hereby request your Excellency to instruct the Yinxian County Magistrate to correct the hasty and inappropriate aspects of this announcement and order him to strictly prohibit excavation in rural areas to reassure the people. We await your reply. Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, Yu Hede, et al., respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram to Commissioner Zhao, Ningbo, Yinxian District Administrative Commissioner Zhao Xun, As reported, the Ningbo County Government announced that all tombs in the old city area of Ningbo, regardless of whether they are existing tombs, floating coffins, or exposed coffins, must be demolished and relocated before May 10th. The fellow villagers from the old city area in Shanghai are deeply alarmed and have come to the Association to inquire about the details and request assistance. It is understood that the demolition and relocation of floating coffins and exposed coffins has already been carried out in Ningbo, and those that have not been relocated are being registered by various townships and towns according to orders. Now, a sudden order has been issued to demolish and relocate the existing tombs as well, and the deadline is imminent, causing the people to be at a loss. In addition to reporting to Chairman Huang, we respectfully request you to consider the difficulty of demolishing and relocating existing tombs and quickly correct the announcement of the Yinxian County Government to reassure the people and avoid disputes. We await your reply. Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, Yu Hede, et al., respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Ham Trade in Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(Part 21 of the Overview of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai) 2. Ham Merchants in the City</p>
<p>The ham merchants in the city are distinguished by their origins: Lanxi, Danyang, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, and Huizhou. Although the number of Jinlan and Lanxi ham merchants is small, they are purely ham merchants. The Ningbo, Zhenjiang, and Huizhou merchants also account for a small number. The Danyang merchants account for the largest number, accounting for 40-50% of the total. However, most of the Danyang merchants are frozen meat and cured meat shops that also sell hams, so they cannot be considered purely ham merchants. Before the September 18th Incident, there were more than 200 ham shops in Shanghai. Today, the number is much lower. Currently, there are only eight or nine relatively large ham shops in Shanghai. There used to be nine shops that formed a "Great United Association," but there is no distinction between large and small shops in the industry. However, these few shops are indeed larger in scope than others. A list of their names is provided below for reference.</p>
<p>Shop Name Address Manager's Name</p>
<p>Junfeng Henan Road, Paochengchang Zhan Zhiliang</p>
<p>Feng North Fujian Road Lou Renshou</p>
<p>South Wanyouquan East Men Road Cai Jiqing</p>
<p>North Wanyouquan Nanjing Road Dong Shaozhi</p>
<p>Jinlan Nanjing Road Guan Ruqing</p>
<p>Tongfeng East Men Road Wang Wuting</p>
<p>Maoshenghe Nanjing Road Wang Wuting</p>
<p>Tongshenghe Henan Road Wu Chushan</p>
<p>(Note) Tongfeng, Maoshenghe, and Ruishenghe are affiliated shops. Ham merchants used to jointly establish a Ham Industry Association, but since the production area of southern ham is Jinhua, the association was attached to the Jinhua Guildhall outside the West Gate. Since the establishment of the Ham Industry Association, the name of the association no longer exists. The current Ham Industry Association is located in Gongheli, Fuzhou Road, with a secretary stationed in the association to manage all association affairs. As for the association fees, they are not uniform for each shop. Large shops pay two yuan per month, medium shops pay one yuan per month, and small shops pay six jiao per month. The capital of ham merchants varies in size. If they set up their own buying stations in the production area to purchase goods, they must have capital of around 150,000 yuan. For medium-sized shops, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan is sufficient. For cured meat shops that also sell hams, the scale is even smaller, and a capital of several thousand yuan is enough to manage.</p>
<p>The ham business has gradually developed since 1929, and sales in various places have been very prosperous. If it can continue to develop, the future is limitless. Unexpectedly, after the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Shanghai market gradually declined, and sales in various places stagnated again. Harbin, Liaoning, and other places, which used to have large sales volumes, have now completely stopped trading. From May, June, July, and August last year, the ham market was at its lowest point. The selling price of northern ham in Shanghai fell to a minimum of 24-25 yuan per dan, which was a loss of 20 yuan per dan compared to the purchase cost (45-46 yuan per dan). This year, there has been a slight turnaround, and the selling price has risen to 33-34 yuan per dan (Shanghai scale). However, due to years of losses, production in the production area has decreased significantly. Southern ham can be sold after being stored for one or two years. Last year, the selling price in Shanghai was about 40 yuan per dan. This year, it has rebounded slightly to about 46-47 yuan. It is said that it is still difficult for ham merchants to make a profit, or that they still have to lose several yuan per dan. (The End)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Residents' Spring Outing Extravaganza</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 People Departed in the Past Two Days, Estimated Spending of 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Starting today, and especially with the designation of "next Monday (the 13th) as Tomb-Sweeping Day," coupled with the existing Easter holidays for Western employees of Shanghai's foreign firms, Chinese bank employees are also taking advantage of the tomb-sweeping holiday. Drawing from past experience, many Chinese and foreign individuals in Shanghai are bound to travel. Returning home to sweep the tombs is a duty incumbent upon all children, especially as it coincides with the pleasantly mild weather following the Qingming Festival. This year's wave of tourists is even more enthusiastic than in previous years, stemming from the interconnected nature of bank holidays and tomb-sweeping outings, a truly perfect and legitimate combination. However, besides the banking sector, other institutions are not granting holidays, leaving some with tombs they cannot sweep. Can those who are children of their parents feel at ease?</p>
<p>Enough with the digressions. To investigate the number of people traveling in these two days, this reporter made inquiries at travel agencies and transportation companies, gaining a general understanding. First, regarding travel destinations, it is said that due to the short holiday, long-distance trips are rare. Hangzhou is the most popular destination, followed by Jinhua and Lanxi, then Suzhou and Wuxi, and finally Huangshan and Tianmu Mountain. Moganshan is mostly frequented by foreigners. Second, concerning the number of people, excluding previous days, in the past two days alone, over 10,000 people went to Hangzhou, 500 to Jinhua and Lanxi, about 400 to Suzhou, 300 to Wuxi, 100 to Huangshan, about 80 to Tianmu Mountain, and about 50 to Moganshan, totaling over 11,000 people. Third, regarding estimated expenses, naturally, wealthy individuals or families who go to Hangzhou to burn incense may spend hundreds of yuan without a second thought. Now, if we calculate an average of 35 yuan per person, the travel expenses for these 11,000 people amount to approximately 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above figures pertain to those traveling by train. The exact number of people driving along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway in private cars is difficult to ascertain at this time.</p>
<p>As for water travel, the Nanking Excursion Trip organized by Jardine Matheson departed last night on the "Gonghe" steamship. Although the Yangtze River is filled with muddy yellow water, the leisurely journey offers a sufficient opportunity to soak in the scenery of the water and sky. In addition, many people are traveling to Ningbo by boat to visit Xuedou Temple. Furthermore, Sir. F.Lirth-Ross has also organized a tour group to Ningbo, departing on the "New Beijing."</p>
<p>The reporter also visited the North Railway Station and found it bustling with activity. Automobiles formed rows in the square, fashionable women resembled clouds in the hall, and the platforms were filled with clusters of people. Each person wore a satisfied smile, holding cameras and binoculars. Women wore brightly colored new clothes, and children jumped around, creating an atmosphere of peace and prosperity. Although yesterday's weather was a bit chilly, it was much more refreshing than the sultry heat of the previous few days due to low pressure.</p>
<p>Those with the highest spirits were none other than the Hangzhou innkeepers and small boat operators. High-end hotels around the Inner Lake, such as the Xiling Hotel and the Xin Xin Hotel, had all their rooms booked in advance. Yesterday afternoon, many people were making long-distance calls to Hangzhou to reserve rooms, only to find it was already too late. As for the small boats in Hangzhou, they are sure to "shave the cucumbers," demanding no less than four yuan in legal tender for a day of rowing.</p>
<p>Shanghai residents are always enthusiastic about spending, with 400,000 yuan in travel expenses being spent in just three or four days. However, the city of Hangzhou, renowned worldwide for its scenery, expresses extreme delight.</p>

<p>Four, Summary of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>Operational Requirements</p>
<p>The methods for classroom exercises, extracurricular exercises, and examinations are the same as those for junior high school. However, high school students have a more ample understanding ability and should have their interest in independent study stimulated and their ability to conduct independent research cultivated. Therefore, attention should be paid to the following matters: Designate teaching materials in advance and have students preview them. For simpler materials, students can be assigned to ask and answer questions in the classroom in lieu of didactic explanations. After studying a chapter or a substantial section, students should be required to create their own summaries in the form of tables or diagrams. Reference materials should be designated, and students should be directed to conduct group or individual independent consultations under the guidance of teachers, reporting the general outline of the results obtained or creating difficult problems outside the textbook for independent calculation and discussion. If it is not possible for all students in the class to complete this extracurricular assignment, it should be done by those with better aptitude and academic ability. In addition to lecturing on the regular curriculum, if there is extra time, students can practice their note-taking skills in the classroom, and then organize and transcribe their notes for the teacher to evaluate. Special teaching materials such as the following should be added: computational practice with compasses, theodolites, and levels; methods for calculating the range of guns and cannons; determination of angles of depression and angles of deflection in ordinary and military surveying; measurement of the angle of elevation of a gun; calculations of transportation and consumption; and methods for various investigations and statistics.</p>
<p>Two, Teaching Method Key Points</p>
<p>From the second academic year onward, this curriculum is taught in two groups, A and B. In addition to carefully teaching according to the teaching material outline, teachers must also pay attention to the following: (I) General Remarks: The high school curriculum is the second circumference of the junior high school curriculum, so there should be a practical connection between the two. The initial portion of the high school mathematics curriculum is the same as the junior high school teaching material. It is appropriate to select more difficult problems for review and to introduce deeper studies from there. Junior high school mathematics focuses on the mastery of calculation skills and understanding of basic concepts. The method of study is to induce general rules from examples and special cases. High school, on the other hand, should focus on the theoretical aspects, using the deductive method to conduct a more systematic study. Due to the complexity and depth of mathematical principles, junior high school students may not fully understand them. Therefore, the junior high school teaching material should still be reiterated in high school, but with different details, emphasis, and interests, so as not to bore students and to have the advantages of reviewing the old and knowing the new, and stripping away the silk. (II) Trigonometry: High school trigonometry should be centered on trigonometric functions. Acute-angle trigonometric functions and the solution of right triangles have already been studied in junior high school, so high school can start with general-angle trigonometric functions for comparison and demonstration of generalization. This is not only seeking the universality of theory but is also a necessary knowledge for those studying physics. The trigonometry taught in junior high school is primarily simple, while high school should pay attention to the properties of trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities, and equations (all of which should be compared with corresponding problems in algebra) for use when conducting higher mathematics. (III) Geometry: High school geometry should train students' ability to automatically explore and pay attention to logical order, so as to achieve a considerable degree of rigor. Geometry places the most emphasis on logical order. Junior high school students are young and immature, and it is not easy to strictly adhere to it. High school geometry teaching should pay special attention to this training, but the degree of theoretical rigor should be limited to what students can feel is necessary and can understand. The theorems already learned in junior high school should be dissected again using an enlightening method, and the method of proof by contradiction should be used as much as possible to clarify the path of thinking. The relationships between theorems should be used to form a system, showing the consistent thread of the entire geometry, so that students can grasp the key points and increase their ability to apply them. However, the system should be viewed from a theoretical perspective to facilitate understanding and memory and should not be reduced to rigid classification. Parts that were not taught in detail in junior high school should be supplemented, and attention should be paid to the two parts of loci and construction problems. In addition to reasoning and proving problems, these two parts can also develop students' ability to explore and invent. Geometric proofs and constructions should use algebraic methods as much as possible within the possible scope to find the relationship between known and unknown quantities. Solid geometry focuses on clarifying spatial properties and measurement methods, so that students can see through the figures on the plane and understand the structure of various solids in order to connect with the drawing of utensils in the drawing class. (IV) Algebra and Higher Algebra: High school algebra should focus on functions and equations. Students do not easily understand the concept of function. Teachers should explain it carefully when deriving the variations of elementary functions to establish its foundation. The quadratic function is the most suitable example. Junior high school graduates can understand the method of solving equations, so high school algebra should focus on the general properties of equations, the principle of co-solution, discussing the changes in solutions ("equations containing parameters") and increasing or decreasing ("such as the roots of fractional equations and irrational equations"). The quadratic equation is the entry point to equations and is most suitable for training students' thinking. Higher algebra focuses on equation theory. The existence of complex numbers is a prerequisite for the establishment of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Determinants are a powerful tool for the elimination method. Although series are limit operations and differ greatly from algebraic properties, all expansions of functions rely on them and are the foundation of analytic geometry. Therefore, more attention should also be paid to them. Application problems of equations should not be limited to daily facts but should be connected with geometry, trigonometry, physics, and chemistry. In practical problems, attention should be paid to the accuracy of the results obtained. Numerical solution methods for higher-degree numerical equations have many practical uses and should be known by those who study calculation. Probability is the core of statistics and should also be taught in general terms. (V) Analytic Geometry: High school analytic geometry should integrate algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to show the mutual use of these subjects. On the one hand, it serves as a general conclusion to the mathematics subjects in the middle school stage, and on the other hand, it establishes the foundation for higher-level research. Analytic geometry should be connected with algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to solve geometric problems and to fully express the interconnected nature of the various parts of mathematics. To make the figure and quantity correspond to each other, it is necessary to use generalized geometric elements, so analytic geometry cannot but differ from synthetic geometry (such as the problem of finding the angle bisector). In all such places, it is best to make beginners pay attention to clarify their understanding and avoid confusion. If there is sufficient time, the meaning of Impossible Construction should be briefly indicated. (End)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Circular: Advocate for Anti-Drug Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular on the 8th to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating, "Approved is the public letter No. 343 on Prohibition Policy, dated February 29th, of the 25th year [of the Republic], from the Anti-Smoking Committee of the National Government Military Commission. The letter states, 'Upon review of the proposal by Committee Member Zhong Ketuo at the Committee's first regular meeting, to promote the public's anti-drug movement to facilitate a two-year drug prohibition and six-year opium suppression policy, and the proposals by Committee Member Ma Liang and Committee Member Ma Pingchen, to promote anti-drug education and anti-smoking propaganda, and to utilize social moral sanctions to enhance the power of political laws, so as to achieve rapid results, the matter was discussed jointly and resolved to send a letter to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Education for reference and implementation, to arouse the public's correct understanding of the government's determination to prohibit smoking, its policies, and methods, so as to unite all levels and jointly resist drugs. The records are on file. This Committee deeply believes that drug and opium prohibition is the most important task of the government, has already issued general orders to the entire country to comply, and is also a point of extreme attention for friendly countries. The deadline is pressing, and the laws are strict, allowing no pretense. However, most of the people in various places who smoke opium and other drugs are ignorant and unknowing, and easily fall into the legal net. It is imperative to widely disseminate information to persuade and guide them, to show the intention of not punishing them without first educating them. Accordingly, the instructions of the Chairman of the Military Commission and Concurrent Supervisor of Drug Prohibition and the declarations and announcements of this Committee are enclosed herewith and forwarded to you. Please examine them for reference. We urge the Ministry of Education to adopt Committee Member Ma's proposal to promote anti-drug education and to instruct its affiliated provincial and municipal education bureaus and schools at all levels to expand propaganda, so as to achieve practical results and complete the task.' The above is approved. The matter concerns the important policy of opium prohibition and should be handled accordingly. In addition to replying and issuing separate orders, we are forwarding the enclosed printed materials, ordering your department to comply immediately and to instruct all affiliated departments to comply accordingly. This order."</p>

<h3>Ten Important Aspects of Vocational Supplementary Education (II)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>The above was said from the perspective of the youth's parents and elder brothers. Let's talk about it from the perspective of the youth themselves. After graduating from elementary school, they cannot enter middle school because of poverty. After graduating from middle school, they cannot enter university because of poverty. Helpless, they have to go to factories and shops to be apprentices and workers. They see a group of classmates who graduated at the same time, whose grades are not as good as theirs, but because their parents and elder brothers are rich, they can enjoy the happiness of further education. Looking at themselves, they are just sinking into the industrial and commercial world as an apprentice or a low-level clerk. Thus, the more they think about it, the more unfair and uncomfortable they feel. Isn't this a real situation in society? Do not underestimate this situation! You must know that the youth's frustration and depression have a very significant impact on society. If there is vocational supplementary education, this problem can also be solved. They can work on one hand and go to school on the other, which is very convenient. Those with elementary school diplomas can enter supplementary schools equivalent to junior high schools. Those with junior high school diplomas can enter supplementary schools equivalent to senior high schools. Those with senior high school diplomas can enter supplementary schools equivalent to specialized schools. They can take a longer time to learn step by step and complete the studies they want to pursue. Furthermore, learning in this kind of supplementary school is more practical than being a formal student in a formal school because they come to learn out of need. Then, the individual's goal of further education is achieved, the vocational skills are especially enhanced, and the status of the occupation is gradually improved. All the frustration and discontent of the youth in society are completely eliminated. Tell me, isn't this kind of education important? This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of the youth who cannot continue their education.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Let's talk about ordinary students. Do middle school graduates who do not go on to further education have jobs to do? Not necessarily. Should university graduates get a job? Not necessarily. Shouldn't vocational school graduates have something to do? Still not necessarily. Then, what is so valuable about graduating and going on to further education? But is it okay not to go to school? That is also not okay. What should we do then? I think the best way is to have young people enter the workforce after receiving national education, and then enter vocational supplementary schools (this of course refers to vocational supplementary schools above the secondary level). This is more appropriate. Of course, national elementary schools are compulsory education, which should be popularized. That goes without saying. As for the establishment of junior high schools and senior high schools for those preparing for further education, vocational schools for those preparing to enter the workforce, and normal schools for those preparing to teach, how to establish them, how many to establish, how to study, and how many students to enroll, we can temporarily leave aside and let others seek reasonable measures. We now focus on hoping for the establishment of a large number of vocational supplementary schools to meet the needs of young people who have already entered the workforce after graduating from elementary school. We believe that young people who enter the workforce should attend supplementary schools. This is not only their right but also their obligation. We must shift the general social perception to recognize that young people who have a job and then enter supplementary school are very valuable and very respectable. Conversely, those who enter useless universities, do not learn any skills, and just wear a square hat are not necessarily useful. In this way, the value of vocational supplementary education will immediately increase. This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of the career paths of graduates.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>Let's talk about education policy. May I ask, when a country runs education, is it hoping that it can help improve society, and that it can help improve social industries? Scientific education and applied scientific education in universities and specialized schools are, of course, the foundation for establishing and improving industries. Formal vocational school education is to train the majority of workers who improve industries. However, the number of universities and specialized schools is limited, and how many people can enter formal vocational schools? We hope that this kind of education that helps improve industries can truly be popularized in society and show great effectiveness. Then, vocational supplementary education is probably the best tool. Because it can enable all young people and adults in the entire industry to receive appropriate training and increase their production skills. May I ask, should this kind of education be promoted? Should it be designated as the country's most important education policy? This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of national education policy.</p>
<p>In terms of educational effectiveness, we should certainly recognize that vocational supplementary education is very important. Even in terms of improving the nation's industries and increasing the nation's wealth, we must especially plan for the promotion of vocational supplementary education. Let's imagine that a country has tens of thousands of young people and adults who work in farms, factories, and commercial places during the day, helping the country and society produce, and in the morning and evening, they study vocational skills, so that their production and work efficiency is greatly improved. How great is this kind of effect? If it is not like this, then how can production efficiency be increased? If there are only senior technical talents, but no mid-level and low-level workers who have received appropriate training to be used, I am afraid it is still useless. From this, we can prove the value and importance of vocational supplementary education. This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of increasing production efficiency.</p>
<p>Let's talk about vocational education itself. Vocational education was originally based on formal agricultural, industrial, and commercial vocational schools as the orthodox path. However, now it is not the case. In addition to formal vocational schools, there are also vocational supplementary schools and vocational guidance. It can be said that the entire composition of vocational education has these three elements, just like the three legs of a tripod, none of which can be missing. Because vocational schools alone can never popularize vocational education. With vocational schools, and then with vocational supplementary schools, then vocational education can be said to be popularized. This is a certain and unchangeable principle. Formal vocational schools require formal equipment and formal students. Of course, students do nothing else but study. Not to mention today's China, vocational schools cannot be universally established. Even in Europe and America, how can they be universally established? Moreover, whether vocational school graduates have jobs to take after leaving school depends on the social situation. If the vocational supplementary school admits people who are already working in the industry, it is of course much more convenient and these problems will not occur. This can really supplement the lack of effectiveness of formal vocational schools and make the effectiveness of vocational education universal in society. This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of the effectiveness of vocational education itself.</p>
<h3>Shen Siliang Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</h3>

<p>School Investigation - An Overview of British Schools in Shanghai (I) by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>There are a total of seven British schools in Shanghai; five public schools are the Municipal Council Western Public Schools established by the Public Concession; and two private schools are English Boys' and Girls' Schools established by British expatriates. The five Western Public Schools established by the Municipal Council admit the children of Westerners who pay taxes in the Public Concession. Therefore, although the training and educational facilities in the schools are mainly based on British educational principles, they also take into account the children of expatriates from other countries, and cannot implement purely British-style education. However, since the students enrolled in private English schools are all children of British expatriates, and their organization and management are all managed by British expatriates in Shanghai, all facilities in the schools can represent the characteristics of purely British education. This article first describes the overview of the private English boys' school; the overview of the private English girls' school will be introduced in another article later. The author is very grateful to Reverend Quake, the principal of the school, for providing information in many ways and for providing a booklet about the school!</p>
<p>1.  A School Representing British Education</p>
<p>The original name of the private English boys' school was The Cathedral Boys School, Henry Lester Endowment, which directly translates to the Cathedral Boys' School established by the Lester Heritage Fund. Originally, the school was initially established in 1902 by Holy Trinity Church (Editor's note: a cathedral is the chapel where the bishop resides) at No. 219 Jiangxi Road; the purpose of establishing the school at that time was to recruit children for the cathedral choir. Later, the number of children enrolled gradually increased, and the school became a school for British children. However, the school buildings initially built were not suitable for educational ideals; therefore, the wealthy British merchant Mr. Lester bequeathed a large sum of money to the school in his will to rebuild the new school buildings when he was dying. At that time, Holy Trinity Cathedral was willing to lease a piece of land to the school for the construction of school buildings, so the school had a source of land and funding. In September 1929, the new school buildings were completed, and the number of students increased. The school officially became an English boys' school.</p>
<p>The school was established for two purposes: the first is to prepare British children to enter public middle schools in their home country when they return home; the second is to provide children who do not return to their home country with an education in Shanghai similar to that of British public middle schools. Mr. Lester stipulated in his will that students at the school must be British citizens, be at least seven years old, and have a clear background. The school is organized into two years of preparatory courses and six years of middle school. The preparatory course is equivalent to our country's higher elementary school, and the middle school is divided into junior and senior levels, with two years in the junior level and four years in the senior level. Graduates of the school can participate in the entrance examination held in Shanghai by Cambridge University in the United Kingdom; if they pass the examination, they can directly enter famous universities in the United Kingdom without examination. The school tries its best to assimilate with British schools in terms of training and educational facilities and atmosphere; the teachers and staff employed are all graduates from British universities to implement this British-style education.</p>

<h3>Finance - Raw Gold Rises - Gold Bar Market Gradually Activates - Result Rebounds by One Yuan and One Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market rebounded due to the rise in raw gold and a slight increase in large buyers' interest, but there was no shortage of sell-offs at high prices, and the heat seemed quite vague. Due to the Spring Festival holiday, the result was quite quiet. In the early morning, overseas silver markets showed English contraction and American stability.

After opening, there was a mixed demand from large buyers, with more long positions. Later, due to a slight blockage in the bank, there were more sellers, and the market once weakened. The HSBC listing announcement revealed that both British and American currencies suddenly stabilized. Later, the large buyers jointly purchased bars, gradually pulling up the market. Although the silver balancing tax announcement fell by half a cent, the buying interest still vibrated, and finally turned firm. Unexpectedly, the bank still came to sell, and there was a flow of sell-offs taking advantage of the high prices. The general trend was flat and tired at noon. The after-market gradually declined. Later, as the bank sold shillings and the Indian silver report rose by 2 annas, it gradually declined. Large buyers then bought back at true low prices. Thus, the final market was stable again. Spot contracts fell by 4.3 yuan in May. The market conditions for today are recorded below.</p>

Yuanmaoyong, Qingfayong, Futaiyong, Fuxingyong, Dafayong Hengyu purchased, rising to 3.1 yuan. Tongtaichang sold forcefully, and the closing price was still 1143.1 yuan. The market was peaceful after closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was raised to 1145.6 yuan for the standard gold bar price of the Central Bank, about 2.5 yuan higher than the closing price, and 3 jiao higher than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 1138 yuan, and 1143 yuan for May. The morning water supplement was 1138 yuan, the same in the afternoon. The pure gold price was 4 yuan higher, at 1146.6 yuan.

Yicheng Shendayong advanced first and then came out, Da Decheng Fuxingyong came out first and then advanced.</p>
<p>It was found that the market conditions for one day were uncertain, and the spread was 1142.6 yuan, and the closing price was 1143.1 yuan. The highest price was 1143.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 1142.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1.5 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 1.1 yuan from the previous close.

<h3>Chinese Merchants Lack Activity - Foreign Exchange Situation Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was slightly uncertain due to the lack of involvement of Chinese merchants and the varying appetites of banks. In the early morning, overseas telegraphs indicated that London's large contracts contracted by 0.0625 in both near and far terms.

After opening, the bank slightly sold US dollars, but as the HSBC listing announcement revealed that both British and American currencies were stable, the market remained stable. Banks traded with each other, and the process was mediocre. After entering the market, the silver balancing tax announcement fell by half a cent, but as people's hearts were unexpectedly good, Chinese merchants slightly pulled up the market, so there was still no impact. Banks still sold forward US dollars and made arbitrage exchange. The market was stable in the first half. Later, as the market was still flat, it was extended to the close. The near-term selling price was strong at one shilling and two and a half pence for British exchange, and 29.875 and 9375 yuan for American exchange, compared to the previous close, with British exchange slightly looser and American exchange slightly tighter.

<h3>As the End of the Fourth Month Approaches, the Financial Situation Still Feels Sluggish</h3>
<p>In past years, during the long flood season, deposits and withdrawals in the banking and money industries were extremely busy. However, this year, everything has come to a standstill. Moreover, long-term loans from Ningbo also cannot be transferred, and almost all must be settled. In order to avoid danger and ensure their own safety, banks and money shops can hardly take care of everything. Although long-term settlements yesterday were only a little over 300,000, the amount that needs to be settled in the recent few days is no less than ten million. It is unknown how to resolve this. The interbank loan rate remains at 8%. In the interbank bill market, morning transactions involved over 3.4 million in transfers and over 400,000 in new transactions. Afternoon transactions involved over 700,000. Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 500,000. Repurchases of foreign collateral loans amounted to over 700,000, and new loans made amounted to over 200,000. According to insiders, major banks have slightly agreed to lend over 1 million in credit. Issues amounted to over 1.7 million locally and over 300,000 elsewhere. Money shops received over 42.2 million in foreign public bills and over 3.4 million in foreign head loans. Remittances from various sources amounted to over 400,000. Bank receipts included over 2.4 million in foreign bank bill receipts and various goods. Bank receipts for foreign banks included over 2.4 million in foreign bank bill receipts, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 600,000 in special transfers. Chinese banks received over 2.78 million in bill receipts, over 4.2 million in various goods, remittances, mortgages, tax deposits, and miscellaneous receipts, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 400,000 in remittances. Japanese banks received over 2.2 million in bill receipts, over 3.5 million in various miscellaneous receipts, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 700,000 in special transfers. The market price of subsidiary currency showed that Jiangjiao still had no market. Guangdong small silver dollars rose by one li, calculated at 11 jiao, 9 fen, and 8 li, but still differed from the open market price by 2 li. Morning transactions amounted to 30,000 jiao, and there were no afternoon transactions. Copper coins remained unchanged at 302,000 wen. Transactions in copper coins amounted to 14,100 yuan, equivalent to 4,700 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Starting today (the 10th), which is Friday, it is the foreign Qingming Festival holiday. Foreign banks and firms will be closed for four days (including Sunday the 13th), and will reopen as usual on the 14th. Chinese banks will also close for four days, but money shops will operate as usual.</p>
<p>The total value of negotiable instruments at the local clearing house on the 9th was 48,716,202.36 yuan in national currency, including 15,537,643.56 yuan for clearing, 29,702,094.93 yuan for transfers, 1,911,375.9 jiao for collections by money shops, and 1,565,087.89 jiao for other collections. The interest rate for interbank loans from the Bank Joint Reserve Committee was one jiao per thousand yuan per day. The discount rate for bank acceptances with a maturity of 90 days was 1.2 fen per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Grade A Bonds See the Most Significant Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was about to open after a four-day holiday. Market sentiment was increasingly sluggish. Any trading was nothing more than the closing of transactions by scattered retail investors. After the holiday, people feared changes, so they temporarily jumped out of the vortex to avoid danger. However, there was relatively more buying of Grade A bonds with number 55, perhaps because of Mr. Chen Guangfu's trip to the United States, assuming that there would be loan relations. But what the actual results will be is still difficult to predict. Overall, because of the strength of Grade A bonds, the trend was slightly firm, but the overall situation still did not escape a stagnant, oscillating pattern. The opening prices for Grade E and B bonds were good for 5 fen, but then there were no changes. Grade D bonds did not open at all. There was also no interest in forward B bonds. In the secondary market, Grade A bonds were good for 5 fen to 1 jiao, while the rest saw mixed ups and downs, oscillating between 5 fen and 1 jiao. Forward B and D bonds also failed to open. In the afternoon, Grade A bonds rose again by 1 jiao, while the rest were still uneven, fluctuating between 5 fen and 1 jiao. At the close, Grade A bonds rose again by 1 jiao, while the rest were mostly flat. Grade D bonds had no market in either session. Buyers included numbers 16, 35, and 55, while sellers included numbers 10, 20, and 48. Market price results: Grade D bonds were down slightly by 1 jiao, Grade B bonds were uniquely good by 2 jiao and a half, while the rest were all good by around 5 fen to 1 jiao. Grade A bonds were uniquely good by 1 jiao and a half. The total transaction value was 1.71 million yuan. Starting today, there will be a four-day holiday, and the market will reopen as usual on the 14th. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction value unit: hundred yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Fluctuate Significantly</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday (the 8th), the New York stock market once reached a new high since 1931 due to a favorable business report. Later, because Friday was Good Friday and the market was closed for one day, many investors took profits, causing a slight decline. The factors promoting the market rise include: General Motors Corporation sold a total of 500,167 cars in the first quarter of this year, the highest record for the first quarter in six years; Reports from the electricity and steel industries; Rubber and chemical stocks rose in price; Aircraft stocks rebounded today after falling yesterday. Stocks on the small exchange were stagnant and uneven. The bond market saw mixed ups and downs, with U.S. government bonds showing mixed and tired performance. Total trading volume for the day was 1.65 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Feeling the Scarcity of Chips, the Yarn Market Advances</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with a good trend. This is because general financiers, public bond dealers, and the financial industry have all entered the market and absorbed a large number of packages, closing them off and not releasing them, resulting in a severe shortage of chips in the market. Yue Kang, Dachangcheng, and Runkang all bought in unison, resulting in a firm situation and the market advancing steadily.</p>
<p>Dachangcheng Pulls in Vigorously</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for marked yarn saw prices jump higher in each month. Because of the lack of new sellers in the market and tight conditions on the trading floor, market prices rose slowly. However, spot yarn transactions were not smooth, and customer purchases were rare. Industry sentiment was still bearish, so the situation was moderate. During the second and third sessions, Yue Kang, Fung, Runkang, Yuanji, and others came forward to pull in unison, resulting in each month rising by 6.8 jiao to 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the market opened flat. Because yarn sales did not improve, there was a setback in the second session. However, after entering the market, Dachangcheng suddenly came to vigorously purchase at the market price, causing the market atmosphere to turn firm. As a result, each month's opening price in the morning rose by 1.2 and 1.3 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 1,700 bales, Tongji 750 bales, Yuda 650 bales, Jinchang 1,150 bales, Shenji 1,400 bales, Yuanyi 650 bales, and Changfeng 450 bales. Hengyi bought 1,200 bales, Yue Kang 3,850 bales, Daji 1,150 bales, Mingde 1,050 bales, Hexing 1,150 bales, Fung 2,750 bales, Runkang 2,250 bales, Dachangcheng 6,050 bales, and Yongda 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Fall Short of 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that various guilds bought a total of 452 bales. The selling price is firm. The purchase amounts for each guild are listed below.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Atmosphere Becomes Tighter; Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm and the rising momentum is particularly strong. Actual records show that foreign cotton is trending upwards, inventories in various producing areas are scarce, and market prices are also rising. As a result, people's confidence is becoming more consolidated, and the banking and financial industries are buying with a single mind. Market prices are particularly firm. However, Xincheng is selling off in large quantities, with both bulls and bears adding to their positions, and the volume of transactions is increasing daily. The future waves are still turbulent.</p>
<p>Distant-Month Cotton Breaks Through the 6-Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for marked cotton saw prices continue to soar in each month, with a tight situation. New sellers in the market were extremely scarce, and U.S. cotton was firm and five to nine points higher. Indian cotton was suspended, and Osaka Sanpin cotton rose by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. Yue Kang, Runkang, Changhe, Daji, and Fung worked hard to buy, and market chips became increasingly tight. However, Xincheng and Shenji took profits and sold, resulting in each month rising by 2 and 3 jiao compared to the previous day's opening price. In the afternoon, the market price was mediocre. Because Tongji entered the market in the morning and exited in the afternoon, and Xincheng continued to short and add to their positions, it was suppressed and retraced. After the second session, Dachangcheng suddenly came and vigorously pulled in 13,100 dan. Changhe and Yue Kang also added to their positions. Moreover, starting tomorrow, the market will be closed for four days for the Spring Festival holiday. General cautious investors are hedging straight to avoid risk. The distant-month contract broke through the 6-yuan barrier, and the highest peak reached 6.05 yuan again. By the time of closing, the bulls exited, and the distant-month contract retraced slightly by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. As a result, this month fell by 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the distant-month contract rose or fell by 5 fen. It was found that Xincheng sold 11,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,000 dan, Shengyuan 2,300 dan, Yongchang 2,100 dan, Yuanyi 4,500 dan, Shenji 4,500 dan, Hengde 3,200 dan, Senkang 2,900 dan, Dafu 50 dan, Tongji 6,400 dan, and Yuda 2,200 dan. Dachangcheng bought 13,100 dan, Changhe 8,200 dan, Runkang 9,800 dan, Fung 3,500 dan, Hexing 2,500 dan, Mingde 2,600 dan, Daji 3,800 dan, and Yue Kang 8,800 dan. ,Hengyi 1,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and opening prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Arrivals and Sales Are Balanced</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre. Purchases by various factories are sluggish. Arrivals included 603 bales of Yao cotton and 76 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Buyers Active in New and Old American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, and trading was active. Prices for each month rose by 4 and 5 points. At the beginning of the morning, due to good news from Liverpool and firm and rising spot prices, and unfavorable weekly weather reports, the market rose. Traders bought old cotton, and brokers and foreign firms bought new cotton. Later, there was profit-taking on the May and July contracts. Some domestic and foreign players who had small profits sold, but Lihua absorbed the sales. Part of the market reacted due to buying cotton for stockpiling and selling short on the exchange. Then, traders and brokers bought again, and the market firmed up again. It was reported that cotton merchants were borrowing cotton for delivery in April and May and seeking the current market price, but were rejected by manufacturers. As a result, spot prices rose by 6 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 9 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 7 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 13 points. Indian cotton was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 8th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the July-August contract of Bailuoxi cotton on the 9th was 201.5 rupees, up 2.5 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Still Relatively Firm</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram of the 9th: Sanpin futures yarn rose by 1 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The nearby month was 194.6 yuan, and the distant month was 196.5 yuan. Futures cotton rose or fell by 5 fen to 2 jiao. The nearby month was 63.5 yuan, and the distant month was 61.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Sales are Weak and Factory Demand is Stagnant: Hankou Cotton Market is Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The cotton situation in this city is flat and tired. Due to weak spot sales and stagnant factory demand, substandard goods are stockpiled and difficult to sell. Market prices are slightly lower by 2 and 3 jiao. However, Hunan First Yarn Factory and others made purchases on the spot, and the situation turned healthier. Total sales for the city, converted to market weights, were 2,014 market dan and 30 jin. Except for coarse lint from Jianli, the rest of the production and sales were all fine lint. The highest market price was 39 yuan for Songbu cotton, and the lowest was 37.3 yuan for Lanhe cotton. The sales situation is listed separately below.</p>
<h3>Grains: Northern Guild Absorbs Distant-Month Flour; Futures Wheat Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The flour market was scheduled to be suspended for two days starting today, and will reopen on Monday. Therefore, both sides were actively closing out positions, and the total trading volume for the day increased to more than 560,000 bags. However, due to irregular weather and continued price increases in foreign markets by 2 and 3 jiao, most people inside and outside the industry are optimistic about the distant-month contracts. The Beiyang Guild also absorbed more than 100,000 bags of distant-month contracts. Only the current month saw more closing out of positions, so the closing price of the current month actually fell flat.</p>
<p>The wheat market's futures wheat was completely suspended yesterday because the grain exchange was closed for three days and will reopen on Monday. However, people are still optimistic about the situation. Spot wheat factories are not greedy, and cargo owners also want to sell out to close out positions, so prices are actually flat. Yesterday, 2,500 bags were sold to factories, priced at 5.32 yuan to 5.28 yuan.</p>
<p>There has been no rain in the early regions of the United States, and short sellers are covering. Rumors have it that the United Kingdom is feeling uneasy due to thin inventories and is remitting funds to import large quantities of wheat to build up inventories. Temperatures are very low. Generally speaking, this is unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Dalian Guild Has a Strong Appetite for Bo Dao (Thin Rice); Sales in This Street are Also Slightly Active</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various guilds were still scarce, with a total of more than 20 arriving (totaling nearly 5,000 shi), so confidence was relatively high. Sales in this street were slightly active, and the situation was tight. The market was promising. The price of thick geng rice rose by 1 jiao. Although only the Tianjin and Dalian guilds bought 1,400 to 1,500 bags of bo dao rice, the prices were slightly higher by a few fen. The price of Du Yangjian rose by a jiao, and Yin Bian Yuan was also scarce.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 34 boats of sources from various rivers. White geng rice on the market had some transactions for high-quality goods, and medium-quality goods were also being sold. High-end prices were stable, and medium-quality goods became slightly tighter. Early rice prices were stable, and bo dao rice arrivals and sales were balanced. The market was stable. Yin Bian Yuan and various xian rice prices were firm, and the rest of the goods did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian (Customer Xian Rice) Market Situation is Particularly Lively; Yang Rice is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were some arrivals of Ke Xian rice, but sales in this street continued to be strong. Although there were no customers from other guilds asking about it, the market atmosphere was quite lively. High and medium-quality goods were all firm. In the future, because production prices are high, cargo owners and stockpilers have firm intentions, so prices will not fall easily for the time being. Yesterday, more than 3,000 bags of Gan rice, 1,782 bags of Wen Tai rice, and 100 bags of Xiang rice were all bought by this street. Prices were similar to the previous market. Previously, a small batch of Si Gong yang rice arrived, but cargo owners insisted on not selling, and the market situation was also stable. Yesterday, this street bought 100 bags of small Wen and 300 bags of broken rice. Fifty bags of Xiamen yang glutinous rice were sold at prices similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Oil Bean Cakes All Rise</h3>
<p>The oil bean cake market situation: Although there was a slight setback once before yesterday, the rising trend has not weakened at all. Moreover, telegrams continue to tighten, and sales of bean cakes in Shantou, Xiamen, and inland areas are booming again. It is estimated that 43,000-odd cakes of various branded factories were opened, and prices rose by 3 to 4 fen. Six hundred and eighty pieces of current and futures oil were sold, and prices rose by 5 to 6 jiao. Peanut oil also rose by 1 or 2 jiao, and 800 pieces were transacted. Because the oil factories and inland workshops saw that the market was not easy to turn around, yellow soybean transactions suddenly expanded. It is estimated that more than 1,600 bags of Luohe beans, seven carts of Sipingjie beans, and two carts of Fanjiatun large-grain beans were agreed upon. Prices all rose by about 1 jiao. Du bean, sand yellow, and southern goods were selling quite strongly. Eight hundred-odd bags of various beans were transacted, and the market rose by nearly a jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Volume of Cube Sugar Released is Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained flat and stable. The association divided the market, and the prices of No. 24 coarse sugar, white sugar, and locally produced cotton sugar remained unchanged. Transactions were few. The price of domestic Chao sugar showed a slight rebound because the Shantou exchange rate shrank slightly, falling by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. As for factory goods, dozens of bags of Shantou cotton sugar were released at 18.2 yuan, as well as more than 100 bags of Zhiyang at 13.65 yuan to 13.2 yuan, more than 200 bags of Zhi Chi at 12.7 yuan to 6.5 yuan, more than 100 bags of Ban Nan Qing at 18 yuan, ordinary Jing Chi at 11.4 yuan, and secondary Xinghua Qing at 8.9 yuan, totaling about 100-odd bags.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Production Prices of San Nai (Galangal) are Artificially Raised; Prevent Price Drops</h3>
<p>According to Shantou news, due to disputes among pickers, production prices of San Nai have been raised by about 2 yuan. Adding all external expenses, it has exceeded Shanghai's market price by 3 or 4 yuan, gradually forming a top-heavy situation. However, Shanghai's market was originally short of goods, and prices have risen with each arrival. Now that sales have been satisfied, 30 pieces have arrived for many days but there is still no buyer and it is turning more tired. It is also heard that another 70 pieces are continuing to arrive in Shantou. If Shanghai's market cannot move, then production prices will inevitably turn loose.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Inventories of Garden Galvanized Iron Wire are Scarce; 14,000 to 15,000 Bundles Were Fixed Yesterday and the Day Before</h3>
<p>The recent market situation for garden galvanized iron wire has been quite good. Market goods seem to be insufficient for distribution. The standard is higher than before by 5 or 6 jiao. The price per bundle has been opened up to 3.85 yuan. Inventories are very thin, and many subsequent buyers are sighing at not being able to buy them. As a result, overseas ordering business is particularly prosperous. It was found that in the past two days, Jiufu, Iwai, Mitsui, and other foreign firms all made orders, and the number of fixed deliveries reached as many as 14,000 to 15,000 bundles.</p>
<h3>Arrivals of Eastern Galvanized Iron Wire are Overflowing</h3>
<p>New galvanized iron wire from the East has recently been arriving in large quantities at Mitsubishi, Hongshan, and Osaka warehouses. As a result, there is a particularly overflowing amount of circulating goods in this city. Fortunately, confidence is good, and merchants are relying on it to stand firm and not fall in price.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yuanfang Feather Crepe de Chine Down 0.2-0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday, and Yuanfang's 2984th call for bids presented 34 boxes of various goods. Although spring sales have started, the current day was occupied with shipments due to the Western Easter holiday. Prices were slightly depressed. The four types of Taisi satin, Yuanrong Gongni, and Fuchou saw slight fluctuations. Feather crepe de Chine fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Western red and blue cloth each saw a fall. White cotton yarn and bleached cloth, during the sales season, still had firm prices.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: The Silk Market Will Also Be Closed for Four Days</h3>
<p>Today is Easter, and Western merchants in Shanghai will be closed for four days as usual. There will be no overseas transactions on the 13th. On the Chinese merchant side, compradors and merchants are also taking this opportunity to return to their hometowns to sweep tombs or travel far. Therefore, the Shanghai silk market will be closed for four days as a result.</p>
<h3>New Measures for Export Tea Inspection This Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>(4) Let's talk about colored tea. The export of colored tea should have been strictly prohibited. Since the United States issued the Colored Tea Prohibition Ordinance in 1911, Japanese tea has been able to sell well in the United States due to the negligence of Chinese tea merchants. In 1932, French Africa also advocated prohibiting the import of toxic colored tea. Although the local government has not implemented it, because it is tea eaten by the natives, the colonial government is naturally unwilling to implement it strictly, but it is also very dangerous. Recently, the French government has been actively researching tea in Annam, which is clear evidence. Russia is the largest customer for Chinese tea. In recent years, they have also purchased Japanese tea as a substitute because Chinese tea is colored. The Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has determined that the history of colored tea is too long and the sales are too wide, and at the request of tea merchants, a gradual ban method was set. The highest standards for three different colors of colored tea concentration are set each year. All exported colored tea with the same or darker color as the standard is prohibited from export. In this way, the concentration of colored tea can be reduced year by year. In order to take care of the difficulty of tea merchants in selecting non-toxic yellow coloring materials, officials were assigned to specialize in the research of tea-use non-yellow coloring materials. In the 23rd year, eight types of improved non-toxic yellow coloring materials were invented. After the Shanghai Foreign Tea Trade Association and the Shanghai Tea Industry Association were satisfied with the trial use, the Tea Industry Association funded the establishment of a factory to manufacture improved coloring materials. Because the raw materials are fine, the cost is relatively large, and the selling price is inevitably higher than that of toxic coloring materials. However, the strength is strong, and the amount used is less than that of toxic coloring materials. In comparison, using improved coloring materials is more economical than using toxic coloring materials. However, workers in tea shops in various places have not been accustomed to using it, so they lack confidence in manufacturing. From this year onwards, a new type of "No. 10 Yellow" has been made, which is more advanced than the previous types. Last month, the bureau invited tea merchants to discuss and decide on several methods.</p>
<p>A. Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Pingshui stipulate that each household must have at least one dan, Tunxi Yushan must have at least half a dan, and Wuyuan Suian must have at least 20 jin. Except for Yushan, which is directly sent by the bureau to the county government to order tea shops to purchase it, the rest of the places are distributed to each household by the tea shops for trial use. If there are still any unsatisfactory aspects of the trial use, the tea shops or tea houses can directly send a letter to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for improvement.</p>
<p>B. Each tea shop should be responsible for supervising each tea house to purchase and use it, and the bureau will send personnel to various places to investigate and guide at any time.</p>
<p>In the future, if tea merchants do not use improved pigments, they will be prohibited from exporting once they are inspected. If the colored tea cannot be exported, no one will care about domestic sales. Isn't the loss of tea merchants very big?</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the tea box issue: There is another brochure that explains why we want to reform and ban inferior tea boxes, which can be consulted. I won’t say more here, but there are two points that should be paid special attention to for manufacturing improved tea boxes.</p>
<p>1. The four triangular wooden strips at the locking point of the tea box are best nailed on after the lead cylinder is put in. If the tenon joint at each end can be made slightly flat, it will be more suitable when nailed together. Otherwise, it doesn't matter much.</p>
<p>2. Because the improved tea boxes now have triangular wooden strips on each side, the old lead cans are not easy to put in very tightly. In the future, the newly made lead cans should be changed to curved or rounded edges so that the lead cans and the entire box can be tightly attached. Not only is there no gap, but the amount of tea loaded will not be reduced. According to our calculations, it will only reduce about one catty compared to the original amount of tea per box.</p>
<p>In addition, if tea merchants in various places have any unclear or difficult questions, they may send a letter to inquire, and we will wholeheartedly answer them. (Omitted below) (End)</p>

<h3>Feminine Perspectives in Modern Literature</h3>
<p>— Xu Chen</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how women are portrayed in modern world literature.</p>
<p>First, we must talk about Madame Hulot in Balzac's "Cousin Bette."</p>
<p>As everyone knows, "Cousin Bette" depicts the decadent aristocratic life of the so-called Duke Hulot, gradually declining under the pressure of the emerging bourgeois forces of the time. It portrays the demise of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie—a historical masterpiece of Balzac's depiction of the class society of France at that time.</p>
<p>Engels regarded Balzac's success as Balzac's realism. Indeed, Balzac accurately observed the reality of society at that time, so he concretely depicted historical truth. But what kind of person is Madame Hulot who emerges from Balzac's "realism"? This lady is portrayed as lacking her own opinions, full of religious enthusiasm, and not resisting the ugliness of this world but hoping for the afterlife, a kind of "saint" of the present world. Balzac portrayed her through his own subjectivity—that is, by pursuing such a woman as his ideal woman.</p>
<p>We can place Balzac's ideal woman in Madame Hulot. We can also imagine that such a woman was real among the dying French aristocracy. Then, perhaps this is a woman who is depicted as a symbol of the dying aristocratic class, to be mourned.</p>
<p>Balzac, who completely depicted the typical and stood on the side of the emerging class, not only in his new revolutionary nature, but also in his view of women, took the idealization of the feudalism of the old era—a saint who is cleansed of all worldly sins—as the requirement for women. Therefore, judging from Madame Hulot, Balzac never saw the new woman, nor could he become a friend of the future of women's liberation.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After Balzac, the writers of the peak of naturalism included Zola, Flaubert, and Maupassant. Zola wrote about Nana in "Nana", Flaubert wrote about Madame Bovary in "Madame Bovary"; Maupassant wrote about Jeanne in "A Woman's Life." When these women are viewed outside of the historical evaluation of their works, it can be said that they are not only depicted as a biological side. Of course, people are biological; one cannot talk about depicting the foundation of humans without depicting them as biological beings. But at the same time, humans are also social animals. The history of mankind is the process of human effort to establish "oneself as a social being" from "oneself as a biological being."</p>
<p>Someone once said: "History is the effort of humans to return from 'nature in humans' to 'humans in humans'." This means: humans temper the "human" natural attributes (biological instincts) into "humans in humans" (cultural, social nature; humanity.)—This kind of effort is the historical essence of human society. Therefore, the true posture of a human being is a unity mixed with biological elements and social human elements.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a writer begins to describe the posture of a person, if they only focus on the biological side, they have not described half of the human being, and they have not seen the human social connection and life development.</p>
<p>The basic ideology of naturalistic literature is materialism that stops at "the discovery of biological humans." Therefore, the above-mentioned writers of that era did not primarily focus on biological humans. This can be said to be a major revolution from the previous method, but it is still not enough in modern times (present).</p>
<p>Understanding this point and then savoring naturalistic literature can reveal a good lesson: that is, the tragedy of Nana or Jeanne is the tragedy of "people not pursuing human cultural things in life."</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>In naturalistic literature, only in the works of Ibsen and Bjørnson is there a tendency to demand and advocate the restoration of women's human rights—freedom of love, marriage, divorce, etc.—putting this idea of women's liberation into the works and singing it out. Ibsen's "A Doll's House" and "The Lady from the Sea" and Bjørnson's "A Gauntlet," etc., are well known to everyone. But in these works, only revolutionary advocacy of women's freedom of love and marriage can be seen; the authors did not think about political and economic freedom.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows the names of female characters such as Nora, Ellida, and Svava can understand this. At that time in Europe, resistance of the people against capitalism—demands for economic and political liberation—had already begun. From this point of view, Ibsen and Bjørnson's ideas of women's liberation are only a kind of petty-bourgeois revolutionary thought.</p>
<p>A German critic named Ellen Key once criticized it this way.</p>
<p>In short, Ibsen's thought is a true voice for a part of women's lack of rights; but he still did not understand that "women must have economic and political liberation first if they truly want this kind of freedom." Therefore, Ibsen's plays soon lost their appeal to the masses.</p>
<p>To put it plainly: Ibsen said in his works that women must be given freedom of love and freedom of personality, but how to give it? Even if it is given like Nora, and she walks out into society, can society guarantee that freedom? If it is to be guaranteed, what method should be used?… Ibsen did not answer these subsequent questions, so the result was the loss of the importance of the women's issue.</p>
<h3>No Spring</h3>
<p>— Plum Rain</p>
<p>Not a single budding flower,</p>
<p>Not a single golden phoenix flower.</p>
<p>Like our past years,</p>
<p>There is no spring!</p>
<p>There is no spring—</p>
<p>On the bloody front line,</p>
<p>In the barren fields,</p>
<p>Before the rumbling machine,</p>
<p>On the noisy roadside sandwiched by gray buildings,</p>
<p>Unemployed wanderers,</p>
<p>Pitiable smiling sellers,</p>
<p>Like homeless sick dogs,</p>
<p>Trembling in the cold wind.</p>
<p>Let the heroes of the times</p>
<p>Put on the wings of battle,</p>
<p>And take back our spring!</p>
<h3>Fisherman</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>(Philippines, an island with no seasons.)</p>
<p>The land on the equator is forever growing in melancholy. The evening breeze that shakes rose fragrance in the coconut grove brings a relaxing dusk.</p>
<p>It has been three days without seeing the season of spring. The old fisherman, Simon Ding, has returned from the beach in disappointment. His heavy footsteps woke me from my tired sleep. I gently opened my eyes and saw a thick layer of darkness smeared in the thatched hut, and I was secretly surprised: "Damn! Why did it get dark as soon as I closed my eyes?" So I climbed down from the wooden frame and ran out the door.</p>
<p>A salty, fishy wind blew from the seaside, making people unable to help but shiver gently. The afterglow of the setting sun had also turned into a faint smear, floating on the distant water ripples.</p>
<p>At this time, Lina, a beautiful and melancholy girl in the fishing village, with her head lowered, was immersed in deep thought, and walked lightly out of the opposite coconut grove. Her strong back silently brought a burst of sad singing</p>
<p>"...Youth is like a beautiful flower, girl! Please do not fail this, fail this beautiful night..."</p>
<p>Then there was a sharp whistle and a high-pitched laughter. However, this is irrelevant to me: a young fisherman; so I walked back to the house again. The thatched hut was already dilapidated, damp and narrow. The old man Simon Ding sat silently on a wooden stool with a lame leg, silently thinking about his precious memories: his wife, children, house and耕牛 that have been separated for three years and are still lost in the deep mountains and forests...</p>
<p>He has a big wish: to build his ideal giant house and three decent bulls in the mountains of Rizal Province. It was he who encouraged him to leave his wife and children from his distant hometown to come here, and it was he who made him feel excited and lifted the fishing net high when he was tired; however, the general depression and the rampant famine in the colony shattered his hopes, and he is now in debt. The bakery had long since declared to him; no more credit! Thinking of this, the melancholy and disappointed old man could not help but sigh sadly, his voice so desperate and sad. …</p>
<p>"You are a star in people's hearts, a beautiful lamp!..." The low singing vibrated again in the dark coconut grove.</p>
<p>The old man Simon Ding suddenly seemed to remember something, and he raised his head and wanted to shout loudly at the door: "Xi Ning!" But he saw me standing in front of him blankly, so he said in an irritable and reproachful tone:</p>
<p>"Are you crazy, why don't you turn on the lights at this time!"</p>
<p>"There's no coconut oil!" I replied lazily, my eyes still staring at him.</p>
<p>"Then what about the bread!" He shouted anxiously, but his tone seemed so weak and powerless.</p>
<p>"The bakery has long said that it won't give credit!..."</p>
<p>The old man raised his head and looked at the sky filled with night, and sighed again for a long time, painfully burying his disheveled head in his thin palms and remained silent.</p>
<p>The full moon was floating heavily on the edge of the vast sea, and the night was as soft and quiet as the waveless autumn water. …</p>
<p>A few bursts of enthusiastic laughter were embedded on the tips of the coconut trees and were gently shaken off; a long-haired dog stood on an open space, facing the moon by the sea and barking proudly, but after a while, he unconsciously became silent.</p>
<p>At this time, from the other side of the fishing village, someone was singing in a rough and loud voice:</p>
<p>"...We are like a group of orphans without masters, flowing from the corner of the sea to the horizon, fatigue is accompanied by hunger, hunger... However, who can pity and give us valuable bread?..."</p>
<p>The old man Simon Ding raised his head in a sleepwalking manner. He was moved, shrugged his shoulders slightly, and murmured to himself: "...However, who can pity and give us valuable bread?..." He shook his head silently, and then fell into painful silence again.</p>
<p>The night was silent, and soon the entire fishing village fell asleep in melancholy.</p>
<h3>Night Talk</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>I like the night very much. I think the night is much more interesting than the daytime. The daytime is too noisy, and everything is too clear under the sunlight. It is not as good as under the hazy moonlight, which can evoke people's attachment. Whether it is reading or writing, it is not suitable during the day, because I often think about many things to do, and my heart is always restless. In the late night, everything cannot be done. No matter how important things are, I have to wait until tomorrow to do it, so my heart is quiet. Whether it is writing or reading; needless to say, going out for a stroll is much more interesting than during the day. If there is a moon, it will be more interesting than during the day. One day I returned from a friend's house, it was already late at night. It was still autumn, the wind was cooler, the sky was clear, and the moonlight was as white as water, making this road that I often passed look unusually beautiful. I had never seen such a scene before. I really didn't expect this road to be so annoying during the day with dust flying, people shouting, and vehicles running around. At night, it would be so quiet and beautiful that it made people so happy. Therefore, I realized that the night can enhance people's emotions; if a pair of lovers chat in the garden during the day, we don't think it's anything, but if they chat in the garden on a moonlit night, we immediately feel a kind of aesthetic feeling, as if we have read a lingering poem; the sound of the flute in the night has a deeper power to move people than during the day; if we hear the weeping of a widow during the day, we don't feel it, but it's different in the late night. Her sorrowful sound waves completely penetrate our ears, and we immediately become sad. Because the night is quiet, all the sounds are very moving: such as the sound of the night watchman's clapper, the sound of the neighbor's bell, the thin cry of selling radishes, and the barking of dogs in the distance, all seem to have the sound waves amplified by a loudspeaker, making people unable to think that this is a very ordinary sound. Immediately, there is a reaction, like finishing a sad poem or seeing a beautiful painting, that kind of feeling</p>
<p>I also like to read poems that describe night scenes, such as "Dog barks" Autumn in the mountains is quiet, the sound of knocking at the door tells of a monk returning at night". What: "Dream awakens to the sound of distant bells from the monastery, a pond of bright moon and lotus fragrance". All make me feel the beauty of quietness. In ancient times, there were very few prose writers who specialized in writing night scenes. I have only read two short paragraphs from Wang Wei and Qin Shaoyou. I will now record them below:</p>
<p>"Going north to Xuanba, the clear moon shines on the city, climbing Hua Zi Gang at night, Wang River ripples, rising and falling with the moon, cold mountain distant fire, flickering outside the forest, deep alley cold dogs, barking like leopards, village ruins night spring, echoing with sparse bells."</p>
<p>——Wang Wei.</p>
<p>"In the second year of Yuanfeng, the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the sky was clear, the moonlight was bright in the forest, and even the smallest hair could be counted. From Puning, passing through fifteen Buddhist temples, all were silent and no human voice was heard. By the roadside, the cottages, or the lights were hidden and revealed, the grass and trees were deep and lush, and the flowing water stopped and cried sadly, which was almost not a human realm!"</p>
<p>——Qin Guan.</p>
<p>These two pieces are written very well. I think the night is not only interesting, but also can enhance people's literary thoughts. After we are tired, we light a cigarette and think carefully about the sentences we want to write. No one will disturb us. We only hear the sound of the pen strokes on the paper. What a meaningful thing this is! Many famous writers at home and abroad have completed their masterpieces with the help of the night, right?</p>
<h3>Writers and Language</h3>
<p>— Zheng Boqi</p>
<p>Literature is the art of language, and writers should be language technicians—of course, they don't necessarily have to be language magicians. Writers and language have a destiny that cannot be separated for a moment.</p>
<p>Writers are not necessarily orators. In fact, many people who write well cannot speak well. However, to write well, one must have a thorough understanding and the power to use language fully. The power to drive language, although not the entire ability of a writer, is a necessary and indispensable part.</p>
<p>What kind of language can appropriately express a certain image of the objective, and what kind of language can appropriately express a certain emotion of the subjective, is the most important work of the writer. The great French novelist Flaubert rigorously trained Maupassant on this point.</p>
<p>Originally, writers are very sensitive to language. From the moment they are born, what they hear and use is the tool they use when writing. Logically, it should be easier for them to understand and use such language. But in fact, it is not the case. Language is a difficult object for writers to conquer.</p>
<p>If the language used by the writer is not the kind of language they have used since birth, but the language of another place or another kind of society, it is even more difficult.</p>
<p>There is no need to use foreign languages as an example. Just in China: it is impossible for a Cantonese person to write dialogue in Shanghai dialect, or for a rickshaw puller to write the arguments of a university professor, no matter what.</p>
<p>One of the major difficulties for Chinese writers now lies in this. China does not yet have a standard language, even if there is a so-called "common language," but this is not a living language that everyone has used since childhood. Therefore, when a person writes, they first feel difficulty with the tool that is most important to them. Here, we cannot help but admire Mr. Lao She. His ability to write completely in the words he speaks in daily life is something to be counted as a fortunate thing.</p>
<p>Many young people are imitating Mr. Lao She by writing things in Beijing dialect, but besides randomly using "nin," randomly using "zamen," randomly using "ganma," and randomly adding the "er" sound to the end of words, there is no Beijing dialect flavor at all, which instead causes readers to feel unhappy.</p>
<p>Lin Qinnan opposed vernacular Chinese and once said: "I fear that the vernacular Chinese of Zhejiang and Anhui is not as good as that of Zhili." This is somewhat what he said. Authors from other language families are indeed at a disadvantage in terms of language compared to authors from the Northern language family.</p>
<p>The revival of classical Chinese and the popularity of the recorded speech style, although there are other social backgrounds, the difficulty of language is also an important reason.</p>
<p>Conquering language is indeed a difficult task for modern Chinese authors.</p>
<h3>Road Brand Products</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>It had been raining for three consecutive days, and Old Man Wang was stuck at home, unable to do business. Speaking of which, it was already deep winter, yet it was still raining continuously. This was something that didn't happen in the northern regions, where it usually snowed often instead. Today, the sky finally cleared up, and he was overjoyed. Facing the sun, he hurriedly brought his tools and set up his stall at his usual spot. The stall was located next to an intersection, and although the area wasn't particularly bustling, there was a decent amount of traffic. The winter morning breeze, carrying the cold, rippled along the road, stirring up the musty dampness hidden in the corners of the walls. However, the road was completely dry. If a stranger were to come, they would never believe that this was a road that had been washed by three days of rain. This was undoubtedly thanks to the good governance of the foreigners who laid the asphalt road. At this time, the sweet potato roasters, the basket-carrying sellers of large pancakes and fried dough sticks, and the congee carriers all rushed to shake off their deep sleepiness and set up shop on the road. The soy milk stall, right next to the glutinous rice seller, also set up, emitting puffs of hot air into the sky – a kind of warmth that people welcomed on winter mornings.</p>
<p>It was the time when people were going to and from work. Men and women walked in groups, and before long, they stopped near various food stalls to have breakfast. Rickshaw pullers, when no one was calling for them, also stopped their carts and gulped down congee. They slurped and ate quickly, as if afraid that taking too much time would cause them to lose business when someone called for a rickshaw. Old Man Wang's business also picked up. Several familiar customers, upon seeing him, first asked:</p>
<p>"Why haven't you been out for business these past two days?"</p>
<p>Then, as if remembering that it had been raining for three days and he naturally couldn't set up his stall, they quickly added:</p>
<p>"Oh, was it because of the rain? I forgot about that."</p>
<p>Some took out four copper coins, while others took out eight, to buy one or two boxes of "Road Brand" cigarettes. There were many styles of cigarette boxes. Not only did he have all kinds of Chinese brands like "Company Brand," "Golden Rat Brand," "Platinum Dragon," "Little Beauty," "Red Golden Dragon," and "Linked Pearls Brand," but he also had foreign brands like "Five Flowers Brand," "Fada'er," and "Crest." At a glance, these cigarette boxes were dazzling, but that was just because the boxes were different; the tobacco inside was all the same. People called this type of cigarette "Road Brand" because it was made on the road. Old Man Wang was currently using his small machine to produce it – this "Road Brand" product.</p>
<p>In the middle of the slanted surface of a small rectangular wooden box, a horizontal slit was carved out. Inside the slit, a long strip of kraft paper was rolled up, with a wooden stick rolled inside the paper. Cigarette paper coated with paste was placed flat below the horizontal slit, and tobacco was placed in the paper pocket of the horizontal slit. Then, the wooden stick was turned forward, and when it was released, the new product – a cigarette – would be revealed. Once the two ends of the cigarette were trimmed, the entire process was complete.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang worked diligently, and soon he had made a large pile.</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, give me a pack."</p>
<p>Zhao Ajin, who had just finished drinking congee while sitting on the rickshaw seat, shouted loudly. Old Man Wang obediently handed over a pack, his eyes fixed on his customer, waiting for something.</p>
<p>Zhao Ajin, while smoking a cigarette, remembered that he hadn't paid yet, so he said:</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, I'll pay you tomorrow."</p>
<p>The money, four copper coins, was exactly what Old Man Wang was waiting to receive. He didn't agree to "pay tomorrow." Although this was a regular customer, and logically he would definitely pay him back tomorrow, he preferred to receive cash. He didn't agree. After a moment of silence, he said with a chuckle,</p>
<p>"This, haha, this..."</p>
<p>"Alright!" the other man said, tossing four copper coins over. "Not enough to show my friendship, taking care of you all these days. Sooner or later, it's all the same! You're afraid I'll run away, aren't you? Hmph, it's only a matter of four copper coins."</p>
<p>After receiving the four copper coins, Old Man Wang became much more talkative:</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? You're a regular customer, of course, there's no problem at all. I was just joking with you. Are you angry? Then you're wrong, you're overthinking it. Money is a small matter; whether you have money or not, I can't let you go hungry."</p>
<p>If it's said that "old people are cunning and old horses are slippery," then it wouldn't be an exaggeration to apply that saying to Old Man Wang. He was indeed cunning, receiving the cash and also lecturing the other person. No, that's not how it should be said. Old Man Wang didn't want to give credit for a good reason; it was really difficult to do business, big or small, these days. With cash in hand, it was easier to manage. Zhao Ajin, who was naturally rough and forthright, took Old Man Wang's bad words as good words and said uneasily that he was just joking, asking Old Man Wang not to take it to heart. Old Man Wang certainly wouldn't take it to heart; making a sale was better than anything. He didn't reply any further and continued to produce "Road Brand" products.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang not only made "Road Brand" cigarettes, but he also smoked them himself. This was very different from the situation where ordinary workers made goods that they couldn't afford to use themselves. Now, he stopped his work and picked out a cigarette that was rolled rather badly to smoke, taking a break.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this "Road Brand" small handicraft industry; even before starting work, some capital was needed. First, cigarette paper: a thousand sheets cost forty cents. Tobacco cost one dollar for four pounds. And then there were the cigarette boxes. Although ten cents could buy ten boxes, which wasn't expensive, it still added up. If you included the small machine, it would cost at least two or three dollars to get started.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang wasn't originally in this business. He used to work for a foreigner, sweeping the yard and tending the flower garden, what foreigners called a "coolie." He worked for one family after another for eight or nine years. Now, because he was old, he was laid off. Who would want to spend money hiring an old man with failing strength? After losing his job, he followed a friend's advice and started this business. If he didn't do this business, he couldn't afford to be idle. He was a living person and had to eat. If he was idle, he would starve to death.</p>
<p>He originally sold these "Road Brand" cigarettes for five copper coins a pack, but later he couldn't sell them for that price and could only sell them for four copper coins a pack, because his customers were either workers or rickshaw pullers. No one had extra money, and everyone had to count every copper coin. Another reason for his price drop was that the number of his competitors was increasing day by day. Most people were selling for four copper coins a pack, so he had to lower his price. He wasn't losing money this way. Tobacco that cost one dollar for four pounds was supposed to be sold at that price. But he knew that the tobacco in the four-copper-coin packs sold by others was actually tobacco that cost one dollar for five pounds, which should logically be sold for three and a half copper coins a pack. They were already earning more than him by selling it for four copper coins. Fortunately, smokers still had the ability to distinguish good quality from bad. After comparing and finding that the goods from other shops were inferior, they naturally preferred to buy his cigarettes, so his business hadn't declined.</p>
<p>The sun rose higher, and the streets became lively. The Indian policeman who managed the traffic lights came on duty. Older women and maids carried baskets to the market to buy vegetables. Cars ran in a continuous stream, and the weather gradually became warmer.</p>
<p>Two trash-picking children, with dirty faces, ran over from afar and stood in front of Old Man Wang, panting heavily and putting down their broken baskets. Each of them took out a large pile of empty cigarette boxes. Old Man Wang had just finished smoking his cigarette and asked the older child:</p>
<p>"Xiao Erzi, how many boxes did you collect?"</p>
<p>Then, yawning, he asked the other one:</p>
<p>"And you, Xiao Sanzi, how many did you bring today?"</p>
<p>Xiao Erzi's pile had seventeen boxes, and Xiao Sanzi's pile had fourteen boxes, for a total of thirty-one boxes. Xiao Erzi counted them again to be sure, and replied:</p>
<p>"A total of thirty-one, which should be – should be thirty-one copper coins."</p>
<p>"Thirty-one copper coins, that's right, but look at the condition of the boxes. Aren't many of them dirty?" Old Man Wang said, picking out two broken boxes to show them. "Look, can these kinds of boxes be used? Is it worth the money?"</p>
<p>The two children were stunned. If Old Man Wang didn't buy them, they couldn't get copper coins. How much they needed copper coins! After a while, Xiao Erzi, with a fearful heart, timidly asked Old Man Wang:</p>
<p>"According to you – according to you? What do you say? You – you don't want them?"</p>
<p>"How can I not want them?" Old Man Wang thought of a plan. "How about this, I'll take a loss and keep them all, good and bad, so it's convenient for both of us. I'll give you twenty-five copper coins. Six or seven of the boxes are unusable, so they don't count. Take these thirty copper coins," he handed them to the older child, "I'll owe you five copper coins, and we'll settle it next time. If it were anyone else, they definitely wouldn't buy such bad boxes from you. Understand?"</p>
<p>The two children nodded repeatedly, took the copper coins, and happily walked away, discussing where to spend them and how to spend them.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang understood the tricks of doing business; if you want to make money, you have to be clever everywhere. Now he used those empty boxes that he had said were unusable first, laughing at his cleverness in exploiting labor.</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, is your business good these days?"</p>
<p>Suddenly hearing this deep voice, Old Man Wang was stunned for a moment, then guessed who it was. He wasn't wrong; it was the kind man who had first brought him here to do business and occupy this spot. Without his help, he wouldn't have been able to do this business. He knew the importance of gratitude and should show his appreciation. Old Man Wang hurriedly stood up and handed over a pack of cigarettes. This was his small way of expressing his gratitude, and he didn't begrudge this small expense. He said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Sir, thanks to you, business is still good. Have a pack and try it. Why are you so free today, sir? I haven't seen you lately. You must be too busy, right?"</p>
<p>The Sixth Master smoked "Platinum Dragon" and didn't want his "Road Brand." This left Old Man Wang at a loss. How could he be at peace when he couldn't repay his benefactor? He was very careful when talking to his benefactor. If he accidentally said something wrong and offended the Sixth Master, his business would be difficult to continue. Therefore, Old Man Wang spoke every word with great caution, which was very different from his attitude when talking to Zhao Ajin and Xiao Erzi.</p>
<p>The Sixth Master had already walked past. Although Old Man Wang hadn't given away the cigarettes, he knew that he hadn't offended his benefactor. As for why his benefactor didn't greet him more, it was because his time was valuable and he was a person of status, so logically he wouldn't chat with him much.</p>
<p>He sat down and started working again, rolling cigarettes one by one.</p>
<p>Someone nearby was calling him:</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, another pack of cigarettes."</p>
<p>Old Man Wang stopped working, delivered a pack of cigarettes to the customer, and collected the money. Just as he returned to his spot, he heard someone calling him again:</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, another pack of cigarettes."</p>
<p>Old Man Wang's business was really good today. He was very happy, and his stomach was rumbling. Looking at the sweet potato stall behind him, where the sweet potatoes were roasting, he couldn't help but shout:</p>
<p>"Hey! One sweet potato, please."</p>

<p>Informal Discussion</p>
<h3>Reading "Population Problem and Birth Control"</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Following Mrs. Sanger, Mrs. Martin has also arrived in Shanghai and gave a public lecture yesterday entitled: "Population Problems and Birth Control."</p>
<p>According to the lecture reported in the newspapers, the significance of this lecture can be summarized in the following sentences: "No matter what country, if it cannot provide its people with a comfortable life, it should advocate birth control. The advocacy of childbearing should be determined by the ability of the producers."</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin saw that "before social systems are reformed, there are millions of children groaning in the painful hunger and cold life." She saw that among the "two million unemployed people in England," "their children rarely have the opportunity to receive education," so she advocated "reproduction should only occur after parents have work."</p>
<p>"After the parents have work," will their children then have the "opportunity to receive education"? This is doubtful. In our country's situation, the only children of the proletariat who lack even food and clothing are truly everywhere. Taking a step back, "after their parents have work," the children are born, but what if the parents become unemployed again? Again, considering our country's situation, due to various external and internal reasons, the decline of middle- and upper-class families has been very prevalent in recent years. Based on this, shouldn't we only "control births," but simply eliminate births altogether.</p>
<p>Furthermore, saying "We should only produce as many children as our economic situation allows us to raise and nurture" seems to imply that only the children of the wealthy can become good members of society. Is this the case in reality? Not to mention distant examples, even the newspapers of the day have the example of a "scandalous bankruptcy" case of the son of a wealthy businessman. This shows that the sons of the wealthy are not necessarily "good" members.</p>
<p>People are determined by their living environment. "Having a garden without children" and "having children without a garden" are the best explanations for this social system. Because there are "millions of children" "groaning in the painful hunger and cold life," we shouldn't have "millions of children." That is such a ridiculous method of carving a mark on a boat while searching for a lost sword!</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Martin also compared the infant mortality rates of England and India, saying that "both places have civic education. Now the living standards in England have improved, and life is happy, while India is the opposite. The difference is that the British can control births, while the Indians cannot." It seems that India's being "the opposite" is entirely due to a lack of birth control.</p>
<p>Is the poverty of colonial India really caused by a lack of birth control? In all aspects of treatment, is it the same as England, which is "ruled by the same government"? I think that anyone who pays even a little attention to the recent situation in the world can easily answer this. We should expose this kind of whitewashing that serves as a mouthpiece for imperialism.</p>
<p>Even in England, where "living standards have improved and life is happy," aren't there also "two million" unemployed people and their children who have "rarely an opportunity to receive education"? What exactly does "happy life" refer to? They are enjoying the same fate as the slaves in the colonies.</p>
<p>The motivation of reformism or humanitarianism may be beyond reproach, but in terms of objective effect, it often becomes a tool for anesthetizing the masses, causing the masses to hesitate and wait, and as a result, the masses still become meat on the chopping block.</p>
<p>Advocates of birth control are just like other reformists. What they do is only to ask society to make concessions, not to fight against society, so the only effect is to make the masses wait with bated breath to be stabbed! Moreover, under the smoke screen of birth control, there is also a hidden meaning of preaching for imperialists.</p>
<h3>Little Woman</h3>
<p>— Ye Ge</p>
<p>This little woman is the wife of You San, a private in the 3rd artillery battalion. She is a slender, calm, gentle, and sincere young woman. A stranger, a visiting merchant, would never believe that she is already a married woman, and even a woman who already has a six-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>When You San, unable to make a living in the village, carried his bundle and went to join the army, he told her, "Take good care of the child. I think that as long as I can make some money, I'll be back in a year or two!" He smiled gently, but it was such a miserable, sad smile. He strode away under the locust tree and disappeared, never to be seen again. However, that was already three years ago.</p>
<p>You San had already joined the army, and the family lacked manpower. At the same time, they couldn't afford to hire anyone. She had to mortgage the one and a half acres of thin land at home to a relative in a neighboring village, borrow some money, and set up a few tables and benches in the spacious thatched house at home, opening a small tavern and a "twelve-branch game" (Note: a type of gambling tool) establishment.</p>
<p>The business immediately flourished. The farmers frantically emerged from every broken thatched house and every small corner in the village, and quickly crowded into her thatched house, shouting loudly. Because of drunkenness, wine glasses were poured into nostrils. Fathers and children fought over three and a half sentences that they didn't understand. Gamblers, over two or three small silver coins, fought with their fists beating their chests. Until our landlady ran down from her dirty counter and said gently:</p>
<p>"Everyone, how terrible this is, how terrible! It's just like a market..."</p>
<p>Then the commotion subsided. People returned to their proper seats, rational discussions and debates again filled the narrow venue.</p>
<p>This little woman sometimes got drunk herself, because crowds of young farmers called out to her so intimately:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law You San, let's have a drink to bless Brother You San with success!..."</p>
<p>So they raised their glasses high and poured them straight down their throats, and she began to feel uneasy and anxious. She was accustomed to feeling a kind of urgency whenever someone used an intimate tone to call her husband's name. This feeling often drove her half-crazy. At this time, her eyes burned with unease, and her mind was constantly burning with him, a strong young farmer with broad shoulders and chest, and a simple smile that bordered on stupidity. So she smiled too, and unconsciously picked up the wine dipper and drew homemade white liquor from the jar, pouring bowl after bowl into her parched throat, until her pale face flushed red, and her eyes burned with fiery flames. Her senses began to blur, and she felt that the air in the house was so suffocating and turbid that it almost made her want to vomit. Really, at this time she longed for air, for relief and comfort, even if it was just a little. So she locked her money box, told her six-year-old daughter to sit and watch the store, strode out the door and ran. The gamblers were busy with their twelve-branch game. The drunks were snoring on the table. But several young half-asleep fellows followed her out. At</p>
<h3>Nora (21)</h3>
<p>— Written by Wan Chao-chen, Explained by Xin Xin</p>
<p>Nora was sadly thinking of going out to drown herself when Helmer forcefully pushed open the door!</p>
<p>Helmer: Nora! You damned woman! Look at the good deed you've done!</p>
<p>Nora: (staring at her husband, coldly answering) I now fully understand.</p>
<p>Helmer: You have ruined my lifelong happiness, you have ruined my future. I am now sent into the hands of that scoundrel to be extorted by him. I have no choice but to comply with everything he says! As for the two of us, we will still act as husband and wife on the outside. As for the children, I dare not entrust them to you. From now on, there will be no more talk of happiness or unhappiness, only covering up and putting on a facade. Just as Helmer was furious, the maid Eileen delivered another letter. Helmer read a few lines and jumped up, saying: Nora, we are saved, we are both fine! (After throwing the IOU and the outer envelope into the stove to burn.) Nora, I know you did all that for love of me, please don't take it to heart. I swear, I have already forgiven you.</p>
<p>Nora: Thank you for forgiving me! (Exits to the right)</p>

<p>the door, there was an open field. She ran at a large stride, like crazy, and the young farmers chased behind her, lightly whistling and softly calling.</p>
<p>They chased, in the fields, in the meadows, and finally disappeared into the groves on the hillside. She stopped and hesitated. In her blurred mind, she imagined a shadow, a familiar shadow that she had loved and hugged. At this time, it was covered in blood and collapsed there, not far from her in the field. But when she looked closely, it was gone. She thought, "Surely, he won't be back. He's dead!" So, heartbroken, she cried in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>It wasn't until her slender arms were grabbed by several strong hands, and her body was also suspended, that she realized that there were still people following behind her. Who were following? Young, strong, as lovely and brave as You San. However, she felt a sense of insulted anger. Because she felt that she had been dragged by these thugs into the depths of the hillside grove, into that secluded grove where young men and women meet, and was gently pressed down, someone was tearing open her clothes, someone was groping her chest, someone was... She was furious. She sobered up from the wine. She suddenly realized that she was being insulted and harmed by unreasonable violence. However, she couldn't struggle. People held her down tightly, so she suddenly screamed, shouting in an angry tone:</p>
<p>"You dogs, you bully me so well! You San told me he's coming back tomorrow morning!..."</p>
<p>You San, You San, a rough private in the artillery! The young farmers trembled. They had all suffered under him, and no one in the village was afraid of him, but they had now insulted his wife, a gentle, lovely little woman. So everyone gently let go, jumped, and rolled out like a rubber ball.</p>
<p>When she returned home from the fields, it was already late at night. The twelve-branch game had broken up, the drunks had dispersed, and her six-year-old daughter was still sitting on the counter, dozing off like a clever little shopkeeper. She ran to her, gently stroked her hair, and cried in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>Crushing the enemy and achieving success, returning home in glory. Zhu Chundeng received the imperial decree to return to his hometown. But who knew? He didn't see his kind mother or his wife. He hurriedly called for his aunt to ask what had happened. The wolf-hearted woman had a silver tongue. She said that the mother and daughter-in-law had gone to the afterlife. Hearing this was like a thunderbolt. His heart was broken with hatred. He held a memorial service and helped the poor. He performed good deeds to pray for the departed souls. But who knew? The mother and daughter-in-law were still alive. They had suffered family disasters and were hiding in the deep mountains. The shepherd lived with his flock. He looked at his family but dared not return. He swallowed his tears and endured the hardship of begging. Husband and wife met at the tomb. Looking at their faces, they were surprised and suspicious. After a thorough questioning, the truth came to light. Only then did he know that his aunt's conscience was wounded. His mother cried until her tears were dry. On the spot, he changed into official robes and received imperial decrees. After suffering came sweetness, and his eyebrows finally relaxed. The wicked woman was anxious at this time. She knelt in the center and swore to dispel suspicions. But who knew? Before the oath was finished, a blue dragon arrived. In an instant, she turned to ashes. One cannot escape the consequences of their own evil deeds.</p>

<h3>Little Miss Marker Premieres in Paris</h3>
<p>"Little Miss Marker" is Shirley Temple's most successful masterpiece, with songs and dances, and full of fun, which can be called the highest peak of the eighth art. Shirley dances the hula, plays an old woman, and performs a one-act play in the film, every move is endearing. The Paris authorities are serious about selecting films. In order to cater to the audience's psychology, taking advantage of this spring holiday, they will premiere it today after "A Farewell to Arms."</p>
<h3>Laurel and Hardy's New Work "Block-Heads"</h3>
<p>Nanjing Screening</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Since Chen Ningqiu joined the Shanghai Theater, the checks from the theatrical seniors have been issued again, and there are as many as four (two are still pending). Although the previously issued "Red Light in the Darkness" was given as the second installment. Now let's just write a short note for now: First time, "Poverty is Not a Crime", scheduled to be staged around the end of April or early May; Second time, "Red Light in the Darkness", "Thirty Million Refugees"; Third time, "Thunderstorm"; Fourth time, "William Tell".</p>
<p>Also, some people are saying that I am obviously a "bourgeois" figure. Many people seem to see me more clearly than I see myself.</p>
<p>The propaganda for "Go to Nature" has been written very lively recently, but it is said that the official release date is still in mid-June.</p>
<p>Li Lili asked someone to send out a message for her: her performance for the Bright Moon Society is completely voluntary. Therefore, this miscellaneous note is written as above, to serve as a message.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiyun, Xu Qinfang and others went to Southeast Asia with the Star Troupe to sell their talents for money. The stars who stayed in Shanghai, in addition to unveiling satin shops and "crowning" the queen of dance, also helped out on stage. Recently, following Li Minghui, Yang Naimei also joined "The Comedian" for a while.</p>
<p>Yang Naimei seems to have said that if she had the opportunity, she was planning to make another film as a memorial. Could it be that bringing out the title of a former movie star and making an appearance on stage like this would serve as a memorial?</p>
