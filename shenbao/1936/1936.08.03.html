<h3>農村復興之現實條件</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>頻年國人無不視救濟農民為要圖。救濟之道不一。而懸鵠所求者要皆為復興農村。凡所施行之方案其成效何若。未便懸揣。但就見聞所及。尙有使人不能已於言者。統制運銷為求農產品推銷便利。農民無中間商之剝削。用意良善。然為防虞投資之損失。故意壓抑進價。使農民所得。轉或不逮於曩昔。則大非統制之初意矣。蓋統制運銷首須促進品質。平衡供求。方能使農民免旡妄之損失。農村有復興之希望。今則往往異是。購賤價之原料。售高價之成品。徒為商人造機會而已。至籌設倉庫。收押農產。姑不論其辦法能否優越於典當業之受質農產品。如其作價稍高。（卽近於市價）則市價反動之來。損失堪虞。低則又何以自解於剝削農民。若收受商販之貨。俾事周轉。又恐為虎傅翼。利歸商人故。以都市金融勢力一旦厠身於農村間。環境頓異。面目皆非。無此素養。而欲成此事實。正與强以外國成法移植中國相似。其不跋前疐後者幾希矣。</p>
<p>農村投資本非商業銀行事。年來以工商業放欵房地產押欵。有時憚而不敢為。資金無出路遂。向內地移動。蓋此一途。徑旣可遂其營利之目的。又可博得復興農村之美名。况自經法定以儲蓄存欵四之一。投資於農村。依法行事。更無顧慮。卽不喜經營者。亦以勉遵法意之故。直接間接。不得不有所點綴。一般人多以投資農村。至為穩妥而。不明農村放欵係。一種專門業務。有非普通商業銀行所能勝任。卽用以為儲蓄存欵作準備。是否兩利。亦饒有研究之餘地。年來銀行停業時有所聞。而於其儲蓄存欵作何淸理。求之報章。不可多見。平時以無限責任相號召。對其運用所生之結果。尙且如是。其餘當可想見矣。</p>
<p>今年來農民似稍蘇喘息。此則由於豆麥之價漲。而其成因。固與去年桐油之漲。同自外來。豆價為大連所操縱。一年來並油餅之價。所漲達幾倍。小麥有期市塲之投機。及日商採辦之影響。價亦倍蓰。雖非粉廠所願。而農民固已色喜然物價升降。聽命於人。能貴能賤。權不我屬。卽使一時有所獲。其危險亦堪虞。蓋我國至今日。並豆麥而亦不能自給故也。</p>
<p>從各方面以為觀察。救濟之聲浪雖高。農民之疾苦未除。此殆由於理論與事實之不相應。農民最富於守舊。尤其我國農民。多半未受敎育。新設施難免不似柄鑿之難容。故不從現實加以深切研究。非但徒勞無益。農民且反感不便。與救濟本旨。大相逕庭。如從農民實際生活者想。因勢利導。以事改進。則復興農村庶有成功之望矣。</p>

<h3>肅軍異動與政變（一）</h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>「五·一五」後日本政治上特產物之一，就是「肅軍」。林陸相為了肅軍闖下了滔天大禍。現在寺內陸相也正在努力於此，這使每個日本人，每個關心日本政治的人，都不免同聲要問：「肅軍」是可能的嗎？「肅軍」的對象是誰呢？會不會由「肅軍」而引起「二·二六」同樣的波瀾呢？</p>
<p>「異動」雖然是定期的，但自林陸相登台發揮人事的手腕起，牠也成為日本政治動向的指示器。每次「異動」前，有許多新聞推測牠，公佈後，成千成萬地討論牠批評牠。寺內陸相自就職起作異動多决了，據云「八月一日的異動一，是過去異動的關鍵，牠會為我們指出：「肅軍」的工作，已達到何種的程度；反映在「異動」的名單中，所指示的政治意義為何。軍部如算是探研日本政治的核心，那末，了解「異動」後軍部的陣容，和由該陣容而呈現的政治動向，這確是現階段中華民國國民應有的而且必有的常識。</p>
<p>廣田內閣的任務，當拜受大命之日，是「肅軍」和「國際協調」；迨更易組閣參謀，方把「國際協調」改換為「庶政一新」。「肅軍」，自齋藤內閣成立之日起，已列人施政的主要議程，可是為着荒木貞夫的鋒芒，他不敢觸着牠；換湯不換藥的岡田內閣，觸了牠而逗出「上惱宸襟」的政變；現在廣田內閣，却敢負上這個任務來，這似乎不可解了。「庶政一新」是廣田借軍部的胆，出之于口筆之于書的。他敢對過去內閣，至少是齋藤和岡田的內閣，與以體無完膚的潑辣指摘，也似乎不可解了。可是，如果我們把這兩個不可解的東西聯繫起來，我們便一目了然。「肅軍」和「庶政一新」是相關的，一肅軍」完成（？）之日，應是廣田內閣「庶政一新」之時。「肅軍」而不能一新庶政，必然地有泰山似的力量，壓在廣田的背上，牠就是「政變」。這裏應快些向我們的讀者聲明：在同種同文「善鄰裏，「政變」不一定需要野中四郎式昭和武士道的行為，就是內閣的更迭，也可以使用這個驚人的字眼。所以由「肅軍」而「異動」，由「異動」而「政變」，恐怕在廣田內閣的命運裏，早已註定了吧？</p>
<p>這三個問題旣成為探討現階段日本政治的核心，我們應否從各方面詳詳細細地討論着牠呢？那是必需的，但在本文裏，却沒有這樣的計劃，因為與牠有關係的其他問題，幾乎在前决發表之「廣田內閣到何處去」中統統說過了。現在，另從軍部派別消長這一點去探究，牠或許可言人所未言，也或許更適合於關心日本問題者的胃口。</p>
<p>通常我們所說的軍部，僅限於陸軍一隅，何以，把海軍置諸不顧呢？難道永野海相掃蕩「國體明徵派」的人事，不算是「肅軍」嗎？如果牠應列於軍部的「肅軍」課程中，何以我們不把牠興陸軍的相提並論呢？這就是現階段日本政治之謎之一。陸相荒木貞夫在「五·一五」的起訴書中，絞盡了他所能够思索的腦汁，用「言海」中所有乏「忠君愛國」的字眼，來形容古賀淸志中尉的行為，而海相不角岑生，却從法典中去找詞句。「二·二六」政變時，三宅阪成為叛徒的光臨所，代表叛軍的村中孝决們，也明目張胆地把「趣意書」和要求的條件，交給「天皇陛下」的官吏，海軍呢，他沒有這樣折衝的興趣，一聞警訊，立卽召回演習的艦隊警備海口，到危急之日，還由橫洪派遺陸戰隊向首都推進，使京浜的電車不通。政變之後，所謂「陸軍將星」者，在偕行社中忙着善後，而受川島陸相推薦之寺內大將的態度，也成為廣田組閣的難關；海軍却十分溫和地處現着牠。這表明了軍部中陸兩軍的政治態度，是如何地差異。差異的原因，在於傳統的懸殊，和敎育等等的不同，這裏不能詳說，但却足為我們的讀者指明，人們用陸軍來代表部，不是無因</p>
<p>沒有一個人敢雨海軍是沒有派別的。因為「艦隊派」與「陸地派」，「武斷派」與「文治派」的名詞，常常在日本的刊物中發見。海軍這樣的分派，不大影響到政治的舞台，陸軍便非如此。人們會根據「二·二六」悲劇主角永田少將的人事工作，於荒木派字垣派之外，另用「肅軍派」等等的名詞。可是從今日成為政治然點看來，如簡單地了解荒木和宇坑的陣容，以及明白中派——如植田謙吉等——的活動，好似使我們校易把握了日本政爭時軍部的地位。</p>

<h3>日本旅行記（十一）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者胡仲持胡一臧</p>
<p>在編輯局的會客室里，我們跟東亞部部長神尾茂通信部記者本鄉賀一飛機師新野會了面。神尾和新野兩君是去年乘朝日訪問機到上海的時候相識的。本鄉君則是住在北平的記者，新近才返國。承這三位友邦同業者的指教，我們領略了朝日新聞社內部組織的大體。（註）在閑談中間，神尾君向我們提出了這樣的一個疑問：「為什麽貴國人老指望淸日俄戰爭呢？」「怪呀！這是那兒來的話？我們相信至少敝國的一般知識分子是决不希望我們的兩個鄰國開戰的。因為大家知道一開戰我們就要做第二的比利時了。」這是我們的回答。</p>
<p>我們跟三位朝日記者談了半個鐘頭。於是一位担任着「案內」（引導參觀）職務的朝日職員陪了我們到社內各部分去參觀。朝日社是日本可誇的文化機關，凡是到大阪觀光的團體少不得上那里去參觀一次。因此參觀的人們，天天都有，在春夏之交所謂觀光節，特別多。我們跟着一佃從鄉村來的觀光團和一羣小學生，依着規定的參觀路綫一步一步地走去，經過了好些靠牆的鐵闌干的走廊。這些走廊的有半牆高，是專為參觀者而設的。各部門又都高掛着木板，寫有簡單的說明，也是專給參觀者看的。我們先在寫眞電送空看到了寫眞電送機。這據說是世界第一精巧的西鬥加羅路司·台雷芬根式的機件，裝接在普通的電話綫上，可以自由自在地收發着照片，從這機上收攝的照片差不多淸晰得跟底片一樣。接着我們經過了編輯的門口，依着報紙的製作程序參觀過去。各部門的工作效率都很高，機械設備也都很新，而工塲的整齊和淸潔尤其値得我們的贊佩。廣大的印刷間里，接連地排列着二十一架新式的印刷機器，前端有不住地轉動着的鋼片組成的極長的帶子承受了各架機器上印出的報紙，搬送到發送課去。印刷機器中間，有四架呌朝日式電光輪轉機，是根據了朝日社的技術經騐，打了圖樣定造的，印刷能力特別大，每小時可印報十六萬大張。此外就都是美國式的超高速度輸轉機了。</p>
<p>經過了普通的參觀程序，承本鄉君的引導，我們還進編輯局去參觀。成百的人們聚集在一佃極寬敞的廣廳里分頭工作着。這正是編輯局最忙的時間，因為次日朝刊的初版一到下午八點鐘就得印出來，趕夜車寄到遠處云。此後隨時要更改版子，把新到的消息挿進云，大部分可不會變動（朝刊和夕刊每天都出許多决，報角上的英文字母標示着版决）在我們看來，他們辦事機能的　活，簡直比得上現代戰爭中的大軍司令部。他們時常派飛機到遠地去探訪消息，用傳信鴿到窮鄉僻壤去帶信。他們隨時從朝日專用的長途電話綫跟東京福岡通話。對於社內共他的部門，尤其聯絡得十分緊密。編輯局里裝有眞空運送機通到社內的許多部鬥，送稿子到排字部去就應用着這機械。但是在編輯局那樣的部門，比起物質的設備來，究竟還是工作的精神重要得多了。關於這一點，我們所得到的印象就是秩序的整齊和組織的嚴密。此外我們還見到裝了玻璃框高揭在壁上的四條「編輯綱領，」給大家遵循着：</p>
<p>朝日編輯綱領（譯文）</p>
<p>第一。以維護天壤無窮的皇基為目的，圖謀國家的安泰與國民的幸福。</p>
<p>第二。善導國民的思想，使文化日日新，資國運的隆昌，伴世界的進運。</p>
<p>第三。不偏不黨，不忘公平無私正義人道的觀念。評論穩健妥當，報道確實敏捷。</p>
<p>第四。紙面的記事常常淸新，但也考慮到對於社會的影響。具忠實重厚的氣風，抉不陷於輕薄。</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席吳市長致詞云、諸位來賓、諸位隊員、今天是上海市第一期受訓公民舉行畢業典禮的日子、這典禮給了上海三百五十萬市民以深刻的印象、更給了對於國家的一種新的觀念、政府所以要訓練全國公民的目的有二、第一、是要加强公民投票體魄、第二是吿訴全國公民要養成守紀律的良好習慣、這兩個目的、除了訓練之外、就不能達到、各位知到、要建設項目個近代的國家、不是一個短的時間可以建設成功、不是少數人民的努力所能建設成功的、要建設一個近代的國家、要維持國家的獨立、必須要有强壯的體魄和守紀律的習慣、公民是直接建設國家的份子、他對國家有義務、國家對他有權利、公民必須先盡義務、國家才有權利給他、公民對國家最大的義務是服兵役、勞働服務·納稅·和受敎育·如能取得公民的資格、而盡此義務、國家才能建設起來、才能獨立生存、政府為加强國民建設國家的能力、加强維持國家獨立的能力起見、所以挑選有公民資格的人、加以訓練、使其加强體魄、使其養成守紀律的習慣、我們知道、建設一個近代的獨立的國家、個人能享受和平的生活、而使民族富强、就非公民人人能盡應盡之義務、不可、諸君是公民、政府要諸君參加建設新的國家、所以要諸君受訓、受訓不但能增加建設國家的能力、並且要增加本質的能力、諸君在滬、從事於士農工商、我們要做本位的努力、將來結果不但使事業成功、並且影響於社會國家很大、要有健全的體魄和守紀律的精神、才能担當大事、不怕困難、所以諸君對於本身的事業、也不能缺少這兩個條件、都市的風俗習慣、較異於農村、所以都市公民的體格和道德、更須受訓、諸君畢業之後、不要忘了受訓期間所得的敎訓、永遠保持着受訓的精神、以此建設國家、挽救國難、和使本身的事業、得到成功、</p>

<h3>生絲外銷　可望激增</h3>
<p>商檢局檢騐品級　可與日本絲競爭</p>
<p>生絲一項、原為我國主要產品、惟以生產技術落後、致華絲在世界市塲中、一落千丈、自經當局積極提倡改革以來、頗見進步、產量亦有增加、而世界各國對生絲消費力、漸又轉强、故去歲絲價上漲、最高達千元以上、實為近數年來所罕見、故華絲外銷亦得漸有轉機、昨據實業部國際貿易局發表、以世界生絲唯一消費國、美國生絲集散情狀觀察去年日本絲、輸入美國為四千六百十二萬四千六百斤、較一九三四年四千二百二十三萬八千斤、約增加百分之五、消費額為四千七百十一萬七千一百斤、亦較前年有四十八萬零六百斤之增加、故絲價得隨之上漲、至我國生絲外銷、自去年下半年起、卽由極度衰落中轉佳、輸出驟增、而本年蘇浙等省、育蠶農民增加、繭產豐收、華絲外銷、亦呈蓬勃氣象、計去年六月一日起、本年五月底止、卽輸往美國、已達二萬五千二百六十五包、全部絲輸出、則為五萬六千零二十五包、較上年同時期、增加達百分之三十强、七月上旬、國外絲價、愛紐約交易所多方情勢堅好之影響絲價遂逐日上騰、國內絲市、今春江浙一帶農村、受農民銀行貸欵帮助、且去路甚濃、絲價堅挺、如果不受其他影響本年絲市前途、可望不致失敗、惟關於檢騐生絲品級、實應加注意、貨品劃一、當不致受日絲排擠之影響、</p>

<h3>新任粵省要員　定十日前在粵集中　根據劉維熾氏所談</h3>
<p>實業部政務决長劉維熾、調任廣東省建設廳長、赴廬謁蔣院長請示畢、前日返京後、卽於當晚乘十一時夜特快車離京來滬、昨晨七時許抵北站下車、當返國富門路私邸休息、新聲社記者特往訪、據談如次、</p>
<p>定期在粵集中</p>
<p>劉氏首談所有新任命粵省人員、的定限期本月十日前、在粵集中、本人預定於五日、乘美郵格蘭脫號輸、如時間不及、延至七日、乘法郵阿拉米斯號輪、啟程赴粵、黃主席·（慕松）曾市長·（養甫）許廳長·（崇淸）岑秘書長·（學呂）定明後日內來滬、王應長（應榆）現在陝西、亦卽可乘飛機趕來、均在五日或七日可乘輪首途、惟渠等或有改乘飛機者、悉聽自便、要之總須在十日前趕抵廣州、</p>

<h3>桐油三專家　考察返滬　發表湘鄂桐油印象　張嘉鑄氏在杭會商</h3>
<p>中國植物油料廠籌備處、前派桐油技術專家林天驥·吳錦銓·劉瑚·赴湘鄂考察桐油業槪况、並曾赴漢口長沙常德三處視察、已於上月二十日返滬、茲據其書面報吿、摘錄所得印象如下、</p>
<p>各方態度</p>
<p>（一）湘鄂兩省長官、對於設立油廠、極表熱忱、並承詳細指導、與以種種便利、（二）漢口之外商煉油廠、亦樂予引導參觀、極可感念、（三）外商對於設立桐油精煉廠、以為政府將實行統制、不免懷疑、（四）少數華商、受人鼓動、祗顧目前之利、不諳政府改良桐油之大計、致與外商同一心理、甚至有鼓動內地油商情事、頗屬遺憾、（五）內地油商、深明大義、多贊成本廠計劃、並望政府予反對者以有效處置、</p>
<p>油業趨勢</p>
<p>（一）近年交通便利、煉油業逐漸移近桐油產區、可以减少運費及捐稅等繳用、漢口距產區較遠、故原有之煉油廠、已多停閉、（二）為提高油質及便利油商起見、精煉桐油廠、應普通設置於桐產區、如重慶常德·宜昌·老河·等處、</p>
<p>改進技術</p>
<p>（一）漢口素為桐油集中之市塲、目前外商所設之煉油廠、僅限於初步工作、故出口桐油、尙未達到精煉劃一程度、為亟須改進之點、（二）士法榨油不盡、且損害油質、有改用機器製榨之必要、（三）湘鄂兩省、近年提倡植桐、頗為努力、但缺乏整個計劃、並亟應採用科學方法、指導農民、以收實效、以上各點、不過犖犖大者、詳情聞已由籌辦處轉呈實業部云、</p>
<p>（又訊）中國植物油料廠籌備處主任張嘉鑄氏、日前與桐油技術專家劉瑚赴杭州、晤建設廳長伍廷颺氏、計議浙江桐農油商之合作推進計劃、伍廳長對於扶助桐農、極為熱心、並商確在杭州溫州二處、設立煉油廠之計劃云、</p>

<p>沈立人發表意見</p>
<p>新新社云、我國開征所得稅之期、以籌備手續艱鉅、業經再度延期、至九月一日開征、本市會計師沈立人、發表征收所得稅意見、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>應考慮之問題</p>
<p>國府於本年度預算案中、列入所得稅五百萬元、以吾國人口之衆、地域之廣、此數雖不知共由何根據而得、但以數字而諭、實屬微細、然由此可表示吾國對於課稅制度、漸趨於平等原則、亦堪欣喜、所得稅開征之期、原定七月一日、今巳再度延期、改為下月初、籌備工作之艱鉅、已可想及、卽將來征收時、其手續當較其他課稅、麻煩不少、更有進者、目前征收所得稅、僅為試騐性質、設本年度之全部收入、尙不敷支出之用者、以後是否賡續辦理、蓋考諸英國、曾有全年征稅費用、超逾所得稅額、此點當為籌備當局考慮所及也、新稅之施行細則、聞都六十條、惟未公佈、不知其內容為奚如、至若暫行條例中、則區收稅方法為三類、一為營利所得、一為薪給所得、一為利息所得、後二者性質較簡、施行亦易、茲姑勿論、惟就營利事業而言、頗多商酌之餘地、直接稅籌備處長高秉坊氏、發表談話、亦有同感、茲就木人從事會計事業之立塲而言、將吾國目前征收所得稅應攷慮之開題、分陳於後、</p>
<p>節省經費問題</p>
<p>（一）節省經費問題、前日報端所載、孔財政部長表示之意見、謂新稅之征收費用、須力求减省、然依據暫行條例第一條之規定、凡營利所得之征收手續、須分成兩步、第一步計算所得與資本實額之百分比率、第二步將規定稅率與所得額相乘、始得應征之稅額、於是征收機關、在審核時、亦須經過此二步手續、設以上海一埠而論、將來收入所得稅之報吿表、無慮數十萬份、則必雇用多人、以從事此種覆核工作、支出經費、遂無由節省、且自表面上觀之、以資本實額與收益比較、以定納稅之多少、似頗公平、實則經營企業者、對於所需之資本額應有精密之考慮、始能確定、資木愈大、收益愈多、累進以抽稅、亦殊合理、若資本多、收益少、此係經營不善所致、政府固不必特別减低其稅率也、所得稅之繳納、必須塡製報吿表、此種手絞、大都由納稅營業之會計員任之、會計上對於損益計算書通行之格式如左、（甲）銷貨實額、（乙）减去銷貨退回及折讓銷貨成本、（丙）毛益、（丁）减去各項營業費用、（戊）純益、本人對於所得稅報吿表之分類、認為應與損益計算書相似、俾各事業之會計員、易於塡製、征收機關、旣省指導之勞、復可便於審核、費用自可節省、其式擬議如左、（子）收入總額、（丑）减去免稅部份、（寅）可稅所得、（卯）减去應除費用、（辰）應稅所得、上列二表之分類、完全相符、可稅所得、相當於毛益、應稅所得、相當於純益、其義殊易明瞭、無庸解釋、</p>
<p>防止逃稅問題</p>
<p>（一）防止逃稅問題、捨前列節省經費問題而外，對於逃稅之如何防止、至堪注意、際茲百業凋零、新稅實施、納稅者正求避免或少納之道、如不詳加規定、將來稅收、或須大受打擊、今將較重要之數項、分列於次、（一）資本實額、如征收時必以資本實額與所得為比率者、則在暫行條例中、對於資本實額四字、如何解釋、亦未規定、就吾人所知者、資本實額、有原實額·凈實額·及平均額數種、計算方法、各不相同、對於所得稅之比率、遂亦大有差異、且我國獨資與合夥營業、較公司組織為多、其資本並無規定、儘可時加更改、以便所得額與資本之比率、常在百分之五以下、如逢此種情形、征收機關、其將如之何、（二）商品佔値、各國對於商品之佔値、大都採用成本與市價孰低為準、但各種貨物之市價、亦非一律、狡猾者流、儘可將其存貨减低佔値、其結果純益必少、而得免稅、縱須繳納、為數亦微、故在施行細則中、應規定期終存貨與下期、期初存貨之估値、須採同一標準、卽使納稅者將存貨低佔、致少收稅欵、仍可補償於明年也、（三）免稅部份、暫行經例第二條中已規定若干免稅部份、惟須注意虛設各秤基金、以圖逃稅者、例如勞力之撫卹金·養老余等、共利息亦應加入與本金·並由勞工自行組織委員會、以保管之、（四）營業費用之扣除、按照第七條第一項所載、第一類之所得、以純益額課稅、據此、則營業費用、自須减去、然如何扣除、頗成問題、暫行條例中對於此點、並無規定、營業費用、依其性質、可分二類、</p>
<p>必須扣除種類</p>
<p>（甲）必須扣除者、（一）數額可以確定之營業費用、薪工·房租·廣吿·水電·以及其他定額之營業費用、此類計算簡易、無甚問題、（二）數額可以預算者、如折舊及倒帳等、其定率之高低、與純益數額、正成反比、故其影響頗巨、如由納稅者任意自定必將折舊率及倒帳率提高、所得稅之收入、卽須减少、歐美征收所得稅先進各國、防止此種逃稅方法有二、一為將各種資產之折舊率、分門別類、詳加規定、印為表册、發交納稅者、以資遵循、一則規定如折舊率及倒帳率、確定以後、次年如將比率减低、則此節省之數、卽作為收入、仍須征稅、反之作為損失、譬諸本年之倒帳凖備定為百分之十、計一千元、而决年在倒帳中反收回五百元、此數即作為收入之一、如此規定以後、糾紛必可减少、（三）數額難於决定者、會計學上、對於資本支出與費用支出二者之區別、有時難於判斷、此種困難、在編製所得稅報吿表時、亦易遇之、例如機器之修理、及局部更換等、應屬於扣除者、抑不應扣除者、唯一解决方法、卽視其為費用支出者、與其他營業費用一同扣除、若為資本支出則吾、歐美各國更有將各種固定資產之修理、及更新等費用、詳細分類、編成一册、審核者、卽可據此而定、</p>
<p>或可扣除種類</p>
<p>（乙）或可扣除者、此種賞用、扣除與否、各國有不同之規定、對於吾國、須審察民情、權衡習例、始可决定、（一）其他直接稅、課稅可分直接與間接二種、惟些一者之判別、殊非凖確、普通如田賦房捐所得稅遺產稅等、均屬直接稅、所謂重稅者、應指同一之直接稅而言、征稅當局、理應考查巳行之直接稅中有無重稅、如與所得稅術突者、設法扣除、（二）保險費、房屋所保之火險、應為費用之一、人壽保險類乎儲蓄、本不應扣除、但我國壽險事業、尙極幼稚、為提倡起見、不妨列作特別扣除項目、（三）職工膳宿、外國對於普通事業之職工、大都不供膳宿，吾國情形稍有不同、如為獨資營業、規模較小之商號、職工膳宿、均由業主供給、就理言、祗應扣除職工一部份、但事實上、多與業主膳宿所費混合、難於區別、其膳宿之應供給與吾、亦須規定、（四）捐欵、外國對於捐欵、均免除繳稅、收入較鉅之富翁、樂於捐輸、美國近已在直接稅中、添一賑捐稅、所以防制此種逃稅也、依照我國情形、應吾扣除、及如何設法防止偽作捐欵、以圖逃稅、亦須考慮、（五）兒童敎養費、暫行條例第二條第三類、雖有規定、敎育儲蓄之每年所達息金未滿一百元者免稅、但兒童敎養費之支出、是否亦應扣除、就理言、所收稅率、應與父母之收入成反比、更有父母年老倚子女為生者、則其子女之收入中、亦應免除一部份之稅收也、</p>

<h3>最近物價的趨向及其前途</h3>
<p>— 子夐</p>
<p>一九三一年起，我國物價，迅速下落；在各類物價上落之中，有一個規則性的發展，就是出口物價的下落，較批發物價為速，而批發物價的下落，又較入口物價為速。因此三者的差度逐漸增大，自成一個規律化的决序。假如把三種物價的指數繪成一個綫圖，牠的决序便很顯明的顯示在圖上，三者的趨向雖然相似，但在程度上則大有差別。這個差別便顯示了中國經濟的極不幸的命運中國在國外貶低匯價與銀價上漲的兩重壓迫之下，要在國際市塲中維持他僅有的一點出口，不得不極力壓低出口物價，以謀出口商品在國外售價能與國際物價恊調。這樣出口的物價便不得不愈壓愈低，商品的交換條件——物物交換率——亦就愈來愈不利，農民從前以一天半的勞動可以換得肥田粉十斤，到了一九三五年的夏天，便要花兩天半的勞動才能換得同量的肥田料，這就是所謂的剝削式的交換條件。自從去年十一月幣制改革之後，局面便完全相反了。我們放棄了那古老的銀本位，匯價在十一月三日至四日的一個夜裏，突然降低了百分之四十以上而加以穩定了。物價不再受升騰中的匯價所支配而轉為受匯價突然低落的作用了。於是乎各類物價，同趨上漲，消沉的國民經濟，在冥土旅行的路上，受了非常的刺激，一時不少興奮之象，國民經濟的吾極泰來，似可逆睹。但八月來物價的上漲及其趨向，却有二種事實，為一般所同注意。第一，各類物價的高漲，最甚者僅在幣制改革後的一二個月，卽去年的十一月十二月。此後數月，卽見漲風疲弱，有遲滯不前之象。第二，各類物價，高漲的程度彼此頗覺不同。在幣制改革之初，漲高最甚者厥為入口物價，其次為出口物價，再次始為批發物價及生活費指數。及後數月的趨向，則頗多不同。出口物價繼續上漲，入口物價則一度昻奮之後，卽感遲移不前，有反行退縮模樣。假如把是述三種物價繪成一圖，其趨向殊不若幣制改革以前的規律化。批發物價與出口物價同升，入口物價則微見下落，並無安定的關係，茲以輸出輸入批發各指數及其情形如下：</p>
<p>輸出物價與批發物價，在改革幣制之初，雖其高漲程度不如入口物價之甚，但後來却現逐步上騰的趨勢。入口物價，在幣制改革之初，雖其升騰較驟，但後來却現遲滯之象。關於這種現象的解釋，是頗値得注意的。一派盲目學者，以為去年貨幣改革時，物價雖有一度突漲趨勢，後來則頗現遲滯之象，不見有繼續飛進之事，因此而頻發悲觀的議論。此近皮相之談，可不待言。他們只知道中國的匯價已經貶低，但忘記了中國的匯價在一日夜貶低了百分之四十以後立卽加以穩定。在一個穩定的匯價之下，是否需要一種突飛的物價，他們便沒有考慮到了。另一派人的見解，却比較進步。他們以為幣制改革之後，出口物價上漲最速，且保持繼續上升之勢，進口物價較出口物價為安定，批發物價與生活費指數更較進口物價為安定，因此提出樂觀的意見，謂中國的對外交換條片——物價交換率——將日見有利，人民可以以較少的勞動換得同量的洋貨，剝削性質的交換率，不再為我國經濟的災害。其次，原料出產者的農民，在出口物價高漲與交換率轉向有利的情形之下，經濟狀况將逐日好轉，其得益將較之其他各階級為大。全國最大多數的人民收入較前增加，國民經濟的發榮更屬有望。因此他們似乎希望出口物價繼續居於領袖的地位高漲，因為這是使原料生產者收入增加和使對外的商品交換條件更轉向有利的途逕。這種見解雖然較前一種見解為高明，但仍不無可以討論的地方。以下吾人試析論吾人對於物價趨向現狀的意見。</p>
<p>第一，在一個匯價穩定的情形之下，絕對不需要一種變遷劇烈的物價。此種理由，甚為簡單，凡有普通銀行貨幣常識者無不瞭了。蓋價匯旣然穩定，物價升騰過速，或竟至於無一定止境，則貨物出口，將感困難，國際收支，將因之而受影響，穩定的匯價，亦將遙受調整的作用，甚之至於無法維持其穩定而崩潰矣。理論如此，而國際近事，允可引為佐證。英鎊勢力的所以强固，最主要的一點，在於國內物價能維持安定。吾人假定，倘英國國內物價，短期內忽漲高百分之十或二十，則吾人敢斷英國朝野將不以為喜，反羣相驟然，感鎊價維持的困難矣。法郞最近的所以一再出現危機，最主要的一點，不在於物價的低落，而在於法政府力謀緊縮以企出口物價與國際物價相協調的情形之下，忽然物價為反面的上漲，使法國國際收支更陷於絕境。我們假定法國國內物價短期內冉漲高百分之十或二十，則法郞價格，必歸崩潰，其勢殆明如觀火。此兩國近事，均可作為吾人的參考。蓋物價安定，為匯價穩定的前提條件，我國事固同出一例也。我國匯價，雖已降低的百分之四十，但現已保持固定，不使稍有漲落，倘國內物價忽然漲百分之五十，則貨物出口，將較改革以前更難，洋貨入口，反較改革以前更易，其對於我國經濟的為利為害，不辯自明矣。是以數月以來，物價無急激變動，吾人不但不引為憂，且私心相慶，認為這是最良好的現象。願國人勿為謬論所欺，以為一舉足之勞，卽可使物價上昇如登天也。物價漲高太速，不單匯價將受反面調整的影響，目國內信用膨脹，利益分配不勻，造成利潤膨脹Loflation　of　profts的現象，不單於國民經濟無補，抑且為新的恐慌播下種籽矣。今後的物價，但求能於安定中作緩性的上升，對於奠定國幣信用，整調國內的經濟結構，卽為最有利的貢獻。在飈式的物價變動，不但非吾人之所歡迎，且應全力避免其出現者也。</p>
<p>第二，出口物價上漲較進口物價為速，其對於國民經濟的有利程度，亦有一定限制，不能放任此種局面的無限制發展。在幣制未改革以前，出口物價下落最速，使我們在國際貿易上的物價交換條件，日趨不利，一般公認為剝削方式的貿易。自幣制改革以後，出口物價在初一二月的變動雖不如入口物價之速，但後來數月，則入口物價有停滯不前之象，出口物價則有逐步上升的趨勢，這種發展，誠如樂觀派的解釋，我們的對外交換條件，有逐日轉向有利之勢。原料生產者的收入，有比例增加的可能。但我人認為觀察這個問題，應再從另一方面看。假如入口物價，保持比較的安定，而國內的其他物價，則逐步上升，如幾月來國內的情形所示，則入口的貨物，有無增加的可能，這是很大的一個疑問。假定國外的物價無重大的變動，我們的匯價又釘定不變，那嗎入口物價，將無重大的漲落，這是可以斷言的。入口物價因匯價的穩定而不變，而國內的一般物價水平，則逐日漲高，其意義卽為洋貨的銷售便利，假如無其他因子作用，則入口增加，國際收支轉向不利，必為事實所不能免，此其一。第二，出口物價逐日上升，而匯率則已固定，其意卽我國貨物在國外售價逐步上漲，其結果必將影饗我國的輸出貿易，亦是一個疑問。在匯率固定而出口物價上升的情形之下，倘無其他特殊勢力作用，不能免的出口能力將因之而受削弱。我們再以我國的具體情形比較，允使吾人不得不存此種疑念。吾人茲試看本年六月與去年同期物價的漲跌程度：</p>
<p>本年六月出口物價數去年六月漲高白分之二十七·一、入口物價只漲高十八點六。批發物價漲高十四點，世界各國物價，其漲高無有如吾人之速者。出口物價理論上應與國際物價協調，迅速漲高的結果，必致與國際物價失却均衡，使我國的國際貿易，亦轉趨不利，此為大有可能的趨勢也。轉觀最近數月國際貿易情形允使吾人不得不存此種憂慮。例如農產的出口指數，貨幣改革時一度躍至一百以上後，現又降在六七十之間矣。是以吾人認為在匯價穩定的情形之下，出口物價長此高漲，决不是有利而無弊，倘無安定的辦法，恐適足為未來的隱患也。</p>
<p>總之，吾人之見，物價自幣制改革後，雖一度上升，但立卽保持相當程度的穩定，這田寗是可喜的現象，吾人今後所望者仍為物價的穩健安定。而絕非在　式的物價也。至於出口物價離開入口物價而獨自繼續上升，在適當的限度內吾人雖亦認其有利，但如趨勢長此不變，其結果恐不免於影響我國的國際收支也。吾人今日似不應望物價之高升，而應望出口物價及一般物價水平的安定。政府的政策，似亦應以此點為依歸。於此吾人要附帶的提出一個警告，物價安定，為匯價穩定的必要條件，謀物價的穩定，則法幣的發行，不得不再三謹愼也。</p>
<h3>中國合作運動之本質</h3>
<p>— 陳仲明</p>
<p>—及其所負之使命—</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>合作運動係資本主義社會的惡疾已經形成而且日益暴露以後的產物。資本主義社會的惡疾，在經濟形態上暴露為「不均」「不足」「不定」三位一體的矛盾現象。此種現象一到籠罩着資本主義社會全部時，光明燦爛的資本主義黃金世界立刻就會變成恐慌，戰爭，殘殺，失業，飢餓，死亡的黑暗地獄。</p>
<p>合作運動係挽救此種悲慘命運的諸般方法之一，先進的合作者從倫理學社會學和經濟學等理諭上，來認定合作運動為人類社會的唯一出路，人類只有以合作考的資格來管理社會，管理世界，才能踏進和平的優美「大同世界」。</p>
<p>此極遠大的理想與目標，無疑的値得我們崇拜，不過世界各國沒有兩個完全相同的歷史背景，也沒有兩個完全相同的社會制度。由不同的歷史背景及不同的社會制度所產生出來的社會運動，自然不能完全同一的標準模型。其次，一種社會運動理論之建立，開初時，大都係一些偉大的先知先覺者或前進的學者與理論家，受着客觀事實和高超思想之激動而為遠大的世界觀創造之嘗試，但因各人所感受的客觀事物及所採取的研究方法有異，故雖從同一基點出發，而結果竟大相逕庭。</p>
<p>世界各國合作運動所走的路綫，正如上面所說，或因國情不同，或因領導者之觀點五異，遂演成目前各種龐雜不齊之局面。</p>
<p>資本主義國家的合作運動，不過為懷柔農工，廻避恐慌，及緩和社會革命之一種工具，其所採用之合作制度，係以資本主義為本位的附麗形式。社會主義國家的合作運動，則以社會主義經濟建設為前提，在發展的步驟上說，係對於落後的農村之共產主義化的讓步。此外純合作主義者因觀點及所持理論之不同，儼然形成為消費派與生產派兩個營壘。</p>
<p>世界各國合作運動旣有如此分歧龐雜之趨向；因此中國合作運動應採行何種合作制度勢非先將上述各種不同趨向之理論依據加以簡明之檢討不可。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>經濟學硏究的領域，通常包含生產，交易，分配，消費等四個部門。經濟學中，得到此四種部門之完整充實，還是晚近的事。亞當斯密只注意生產與交易。馬爾塞斯，理嘉圖始注意到分配。馬克思從生產交易與分配的發展中來否定資本主義之生產。限界效用學派以降，消費的科目，才被學者認為應當嚴加注意的命題。此種學說史上之演變情形，事實上亦正是經濟史演變過程中所起的相應反映的結果。</p>
<p>合作運動之消費派與生產派，其最高目的未始不同，所異者出發點而已。消費認定消費為經濟生活之目的，生產不過為滿足此種目的之手段。所以消費行為乃人人所必具有之普遍行為；因之消費者之陣營，較之生產者有着絕對的多數。資本主義社會之消費者完全受着特定的生產關係所支配，受壓迫者受犧牲者都是消費者之大羣。惟有消費者自身組織起來，有計劃的有方法的管理生產，才能革除資本主義社會之惡疾。所以消費派所主張之合作制度，在物盡其用，人盡其才，廢除利潤，滿足需要四種原則之下，由發展消費合作社，組織批發合作社，進而直接創辦生產事業，以完成消費者管理生產之最高目標。</p>
<p>至於生產派之理論，則容留着不少的法國空想社會主義與英國基督敎社會主義之情調。博立葉要另造一個「法蘭遲」會生產組織，以代替壓迫和反抗的矛盾社會，遂開了法國生產合作之先河。基督敎社會主義者從敎義上倫理的觀點，同情於工人階級生活之貧苦與卑賤，以為工人祇有組織生產合作社，才能享受人類的幸福。</p>
<p>此外，關於資本主義國家與社會主義國家所採為政策之合作制度，一則在固有制度之下，聊備臨時附麗之一格，一則在理想制度不能卽刻實現之前，用為臨時過渡之橋樑。社會主義國家有它特異的政治機構得以操縱自如外，資本主義國家的合作制度不能發展為全般的主要的中心社會制度，可無待言。</p>
<p>三，</p>
<p>中國的合作運動應該是三民主義的合作運動。三民主義是解决中國一切革命問題的唯一主義。「建國之首要在民生」，民生主義之哲理基礎在民生史觀；因此，中國的合作運動之基礎，亦應安置在民生之上。</p>
<p>準此，「生」為人類之最高目的，消費與生產，不過為滿足此種目的所採用之一種手段的兩種過程。因此，在三民主義合作之立塲，消費與生產應該統一於三民主義合作者之一身，不應任意割裂為生產者與消費者兩個對立的營壘，卽就是要求消費與生產之調和，以完成民生問題之全部解决。</p>
<p>其次，中國的合作運動，乃是民族經濟自主的運動。民族所受的壓迫，主要為帝國主義者之經濟壓迫。帝國主義者經濟侵略之結果，使中國的社會經整個的陷入於恐慌的萬丈深淵中。中國合作運動之使命，負荷着建立中國獨立之經濟單位，從國際帝國主義經濟侵略中。爭取民族經濟之自主。復此，中國的合作運動，是國民經濟建設運動之骨幹。中國生產落後，需要從事國民經濟建設運動，這與生產發達到極點的資本主義社會僅要求解分配與消費問題之社會改良運動，有本質之不同。因此，中國合作運動之使命，一面要建設經濟國防，防禦侵略，而一面要發展生產事業，力謀自給。在此種經濟建設的目標下，提高農工業的生產，已成為决定之前提。為要打破都市於農村間的鴻溝，使農工商業得到調整的步驟，則亦只有努力從事合作的國民經濟建設。</p>
<p>四，</p>
<p>最後，中國的合作運動，是地方自治健全單位的創立運動。地方自治以人民生活之全部安全為前提，人民生活之安定，只有普遍發展合作事業才有保障。總理於地方自治開始實行法上，指出地方自治團體應辦之事業，除淸戶口立機關等六項外尚有農業合作，工業合作，交易合作，銀行合作，保險合作等事業。合作事業是要遵照總理所提示的各種合作社以樹立集體的社會的生活中心。這樣發展的結果，一定成功為中心的全般的社會組縐，由此租以合作社為中心的社會組織之創立，以促進地方自治本單位之健全，眞正的全民的無階級的民主政治，才有實現的把握。</p>
<p>三民主義的中國，不採取漸就毀滅之資本主義制度，不認階級，反對鬥爭，也沒有社會主義國家特異的組織。國民的全體為促進「生」之眞善美；同時應調和生產與消費的全部過程</p>
<p>因此，中國的合作運動不能生吞活剝地抄襲舶來的形式，而是應該如前面所述，在三民主義基本原則之下，依據民族經濟之自立，國民經濟之建設，地方自治健全之創立的偉大目標，以規則地適當的姿態。同時中國的合作制度，也就應該對着中國合作運動所負的各種使命，使生產者與消費者有機的密切的聯繫起來遵照總理所提示的類別，作和平的平衡的普遍的展開，以建立三民主義政治經濟的社會中心，進一步造成公平平等博愛的大同世界，為全世界全人類築成無上快樂的「伊甸」。</p>
<h3>金融資本籠罩中之電影事業</h3>
<p>— 沙駝</p>
<p>沙駝各國電影事業的概况</p>
<p>電影是現時代的寵兒，電影業在現代已成為重要產業之一了。據美國商業部的統計，去年全世界的電影院共有八萬七千二百九十九間，共中美國就有一萬五千三百七十八座，英國有五千七十間，德國有四千七百八十二問，意大利有四千二百二十一間，法國有四千間，日本有一千六百三十四間，捷克斯拉夫有一千八百三十三間。</p>
<p>就影片的製作方面說，當然是美國佔第一位。平均每年可以產生七百部流行的影片。英國一年可以產生一百九十部，德法每年均在百部以上。日本的電影院的數目雖然還比不上捷克，但製片的數目每年却在四百部以上，僅居美國之後，這不能不算是一種矛盾現象。</p>
<p>有了幾千間電影院的國家，每年僅產生百部左右的影片，當然是不够的，所以除了美國日本以外，各國電影院，差不多都要兼演外國影片。日本生產的影片，也只够自給還談不到輸出。在世界影片業最佔勢力的當然是美國，差不多全世界上演的影片，美國片要佔百分之七十至八十，所以現在沒有一個國家不感受美國影片的壓迫。至於我們中國，更不用說了，試看國內第一流的電影院，有幾家不是以好萊塢美女為號召呀！</p>
<p>電影事業之金融資本化</p>
<p>中國的影片業，近年雖然稍見活潑，但是在質量方面都還落後，量的方面每年產片恐怕還不及五十部，從質的方面說，每年好片不知能有幾部，日本的影片，在量的方面雖然足以自豪，然亦以粗製濫造者居多。這是因為電影在歐美各國已成為大企業，獲有金融資本家的援助。而在中國，資本利率起碼在一分以上，普通工業尚且用不起這種高利資本，何况新興幼稚的電影業。我們試看美國的電影業，雖然在歐戰後始見發達，但在道廿年中幾有一日千里之勢，這原因完全在歐戰後美國金融資本之發展，電影業也金融資本化了。現在美國對於電影事業的投資額，已在二十億美元之上，單就影片製作的費用說，每年也要一億五千萬美元。</p>
<p>除了美國以外，英德兩國的電影業也有相當的金融資本勢力為後盾，在其餘國家，影業與金融資本的結合程度都甚淺。</p>
<p>固定資本的吸收</p>
<p>電影業吸收固定資本的方法，與一般工業差不多，在美國，大概都利用投資銀行及信託公司，發行股票或公司債。然後在證券交易所公開拍賣。英國電影業的債券則多為長期，大概都在十年左右。法德兩國電影業很少自己發行債券，其資金多靠銀行供給。所以製片大權，亦操在金融資本家的手裏。誰都知道，德國鳥發公司的大老闆是一位軍火商人，所以其產生的影片亦以鼓吹軍國主義，宜傳軍火買賣為原則。</p>
<p>至於製片的資金，帶有流動性質，回收時期較短，所以用不着發行債劵。像美國製一影片，有時費用竟達二三百萬元，這種資金就要靠銀行來供給了。美國電影製片年度，開始於每年七月，約在五六月之間，各影業巨頭便要親自出發與銀行瘹涉借欵。可是銀行僅願供給製片公司的資金，對於個人製片者多不願意投資，所以個人製片者多向經理推銷影片的公司</p>
<p>法國影片大槪多是個人製作的作品，在其本國很難獲得資金的援助。近幾年來反被美國資本侵入。美國的影片公司常常以資金供給法國的優秀製片家，其作品除在法國推銷外，並輸入美國，這可以說是電影事業國際化的一個過程。</p>
<p>德國自國社黨秉政後，設置宣傳部，統制電影事業甚力。一方面限制外國影片的輸入，一面提倡國產影片。官方的德意志銀行對於烏發影片公司，每年都有巨額投資。同時有一個影業信用銀行，專門供給個人製片者的資本</p>
<p>美國銀行投資影業的方法</p>
<p>美國銀行或信託公司，投資給製片公司，普通以每一部片為單位。每一部片的借欵都要另訂契的，所以可稱為分釗的投資。當影片公司欲向銀行借欵時，必先向銀行當局提出下列諸件：（一）影片的故事，（二）演的角色，（三）製片豫算，（四）財務報告書。銀行審查的結果，倘認為故事與角色配搭完美，作品有成功的希望，製片的豫算確實可靠，然後便可以訂的借欵。但是借欵都是隨用隨付，與活期存欵一樣。借欵以後，製片公司須每週提出精組的製作報告，受銀行監督，倘銀行認為與豫定製片程序不合，可以停付借欵。因為如此，所以美國影片大致都能照豫定的期間出片。</p>
<p>製片商一完成陰片（Negative）顯影過的軟片，呌做陰片，其明暗黑白與撮攝的對象是相反的），便須交存銀行保管，做借欵的担保品，推銷影片的公司如果要翻印陽片（PositireFilm就是從陰片印成的，就是影射於銀幕上的軟片），可向銀行要求翻印。但是銷片公司要對銀行負責，將新片的收入統交銀行支配。銀行於收到後，先收回借欵，有餘始交製片公司與銷片公司。銀行收回借欵後，便可發還軟</p>
<p>借欸期間不一定，大槪以完成影片的期間為標準，早則三個月，遞則六個月。借欵利息大抵均在借欵中預先扣除。</p>
<p>德政府扶植影片業的方法</p>
<p>德國銀行投資於製片公司的方法，大致與美國情形相同。因為美國是影業的先進國，其投資方法與成規自足為他國效法。不過德國銀行對於製片公司的借欵，照例每片只能借白分之七十的製片費，其餘百分之三十要製片公司自己籌劃。這是恐怕製片公司犯依賴借欵粗裝</p>
<p>德國有一個官商合辦的影業信用銀行，可以說是世界上惟一的影業銀行。這個銀行是國社黨政府統制全國電影業的總機關。此銀行有官股三千萬馬克，有政府派的董事，有銀行界派的董事。尤其可注意者，此銀行不僅有官商界的重要份子參加，目綱羅一切與電影事業有關的工商份子在內。如例軟片製造公司，有聲電影裝置專家，攝影公會，電影院，均派代表為此銀行之董事，所以這個銀行對於電影事業的資本與按術方面，都有相當的監督，惟其如此，始能執行國社黨的宜傳政策。</p>
<p>這個銀行的投資方向，都在個人製片者。譬如一個有名的探險隊如果要製作探險影片，宜傳國社黨的對外政策，便可以向這個銀行請求借欵，銀行並且可以派專家指導。近年德國個人製作影片的成績非常美滿，可以說完全是這個銀行的功勞。</p>
<p>中國電影業的發展途徑</p>
<p>中國電影業，近年確有進步，但和外國影片相比，質量一方面都還幼稚，這個原因常然是資本缺乏。因為資本缺乏，在人村，設備，種種方面，都不免因簡就陋，粗製濫造，更可憐的是連粗製濫造比較可以看一看的影片，合起來每年也不過是寥寥幾部。因之外國影片源源輸進，經濟的損失不必說，共於我們精神上的影響實大。資本主義國的影片，不是宣傳帝國主義的威德，便是鼓吹色情文化，决不能作我們的精神食糧。所以我們現在也應當學德國與日本的樣子，限制外片輸入，力謀影片自給。政府與銀行界，義應共同援助國產影片公司。並可藉此監督影業，促進其製片方法之合理化，經營方法之科學化。製片公司方面，如欲獲得資本上的援助，亦須撇除積弊，力謀公開，用科學的方法經營　在用人財務種種方面，均須向社會公開，放棄同業間傾軋行為，以共同建設中國本位的電影藝術。</p>

<p>每隊對希特勒之敬禮、均別出心裁、五十一隊中均無相同者、</p>
<p>最先入塲者為希臘隊、而最後者為德國隊、其餘各國選手隊則由德文字母循該國名字而分別之、於是埃及隊（Egyptians）為最先因埃及在德文為（Aegypten）</p>

<p>奧林匹克宣布開幕</p>
<p>常各隊就位後、利華德博士在簡短演辭中、督述奧林匹克之義、在此演說後、希特勒起立謂「余宜布奧林匹克運動會開幕」、是時掌聲如雷、萬民歡騰、在此熱情當中、三千信鴿亦同時放出、其中不少環繞會塲週、瞻仰選手教采、然後高飛出發者、其决為世運火炬之最後傳遞者、全身衣白衣由石堦緩步而下、橫過運動塲上、手持火炬、於是千英里之火炬跑至此巳吿一段落、</p>
<p>釋放信鴿十二萬頭</p>
<p>在世運開幕之日、共有十一萬信鴿釋放、其目的在傳播世運開慕消息於全歐各國、並作迅速時間之比賽、此項信鴿來自德國各部者固多、而來自瑞典·丹麥·波蘭·捷克·匈牙利·希臘意大利、及奧大利者亦不少、自今晨五時起卽决第釋放、其中所飛途程過一千五百基羅公尺者甚多、奧林匹克委員會巳具有獎品給與優勝者、</p>

<h3>亞林匹克運動會的種種（三）</h3>

<p>（三）會員</p>
<p>國際亞林匹克委員會（亞林匹克的行政機關）到現在止，已有五十五國加入為會員。茲以各國英文國名第一宇母的先後，彙誌如下：阿方尼斯湯·阿根廷·澳大利·奧地利·比利時·巴西。保加利亞·加拿大。智利。中國·哥倫比亞·古巴。捷克斯拉夫·丹麥·歐根度·埃及·安司東尼亞·芬蘭·法國·德國·不列顚·希臘·海堤·荷蘭·洪都拉斯·匈牙利·印度·愛爾蘭自由邦·冰島·意大利·日本·拉脫維亞·列沙尼亞·羅森堡·麥爾太·墨西哥·摩那加·紐的倫·挪威·巴拿馬·秘魯·菲律濱·波蘭·葡萄牙·洛台西亞磊羅馬尼亞·俄羅斯·南菲·西班牙·瑞典·瑞士·土耳共·烏拉圭·美國·南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>（四）第一屆大會</p>
<p>回顧一八九六年第一屆亞林匹克復興大會舉行於希臘國都雅典的時候，一切的一切，都不是後人所想像而知的。然而在四十年前的時代，有這樣盛大的規模，也眞是出乎意料的。第一次開會的塲地，是一狹長偉大的建築物，峙立於希梅多斯山Hymettos的山麓，直到伊里索斯河Hissos的左岸，這史冊上所載的古運動塲，乃得復見於今日的現實世界。這運動塲是近代歐洲同類建築物中的最先完成者，是一位希臘的愛國志士阿佛洛夫Averoff獨資捐造的。今為第一屆亞林匹克大會舉行地址。這四十八排大理石琢成的看台，益顯得燦爛雄偉，而愈增觀止之嘆了。</p>
<p>邀請參加的國度共有三十四，但實際上參與競賽者祗十二國。項目也祗十二種，且大都是希臘古代的傳統節目。雅典全城的人民在熱的興奮着，全市裝綴得煇煌矞麗。競賽最精彩的節目是馬拉松長跑，這是純萃的古代希臘的國粹競技，對於優勝者尊崇備至，國王喬治一世伴着太子在决勝點參觀，不惜降尊纡貴地和馬拉松的優勝者魯易士Luis親與握手，他的侍從也都上前和魯易士擁抱，這時候的魯易士，雖古之凱旋將軍也不過如比了。</p>

<h3>適得其反</h3>
<p>— （陳亮）</p>
<p>馬路上已有『中暑倒斃』的苦力、時疫醫院　報吿亦很『忙碌』、大氣是認眞的熱起來、『火傘高漲』『赤帝施威』是做新聞的老用得着的句　，在這鍋爐間似的處境下、經濟時間都未能允　爬上山頂躺在海濱的人們，就只得和氷塊扇之類結不解錄了。</p>
<p>吃冰，打扇，上屋頂花園，下游泳池，人們都認為唯一的解暑之法，於是氷，扇，花園，水……都被認為可親可愛的淸凉地和淸凉物，有失此將無以度夏之槪。可是事實上亦有適得其反者，你瞧那被太陽炙熱了的大街上，滿身大汗的喚着『陰凉哇買氷呵…』的孩子，他們為什麽熱紅了頸根呢，大塊的氷不就在他們手中嗎？可是他們為擔愁氷的溶化而奔呼，因用力奔呼而更感暑熱之灼爍。</p>
<p>這昭示了：氷的本質雖陰凉，但在販賣陰凉的是享受不到的。在生活的桎梏中，卽使在自己身邊的東西，都相反地成了一種『累贅』。</p>
<h3>冰結凝小姐</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>十字路口，三顆法國梧桐後面的那家「大麗飲冰室」裏，在冰結凝上市時，來了一位像小鳥也似的美麗的姑娘，漆黑的頭髮，烏黑的眼珠，富有曲綫的身段，在各個蓋着玻璃面的圓桌之間，像蝴蝶也似的飄來飄去招待着全室紳士型的顧客。伊會說一口流利的英語，會說幾句膚淺的法語，會說帶有三分湖南土音的國語會說幾句不下流的粵語。有人問伊姓甚麽？伊俏皮地笑着說，「冰結凝」於是大家便都呼之為「冰結凝小姐」。</p>
<p>這位冰結凝小姐，據說是老閱登報而招聘得來的，訂着合同二個月，每月支給報酬四十元。同時，還支給這二個月中的總收入的百分之五，作為分紅。依據估計，每天伊或許可得二元左右。入額外小賬，或許每天可得十元。因為在大麗飲冰室中。一天到晚，是座上客常滿的，為的是冰結凝小姐，的確是太可愛了。某博士說，在冰結凝小姐招待的大麗飲冰室中，坐一會，可以忘却馬路上的一百餘度的高熱。所以他每天至少得上三次大麗把每晚上舞塲的功課都忘了。</p>
<p>據說，這位冰結凝小姐，是廣東的父親，和長沙的母親，所生的。現在北平某大學的文學系三年級肄業。今年的暑期中，跟着朋友到上海來旅行，逢塲作戲的充一下子女招待。伊家裏。是很富有的，所以預備把這二個月中，所得的報酬掃數的分贈給若干慈善機關充經費。近來伊對於這種職業生活，很興趣，伊說，「我或許能在這二個月中，得到不少的生活經騐。若能從顧客身上得到充分的材料，或許，在明年的暑假之前，我將寫成一本在計劃中的My　Clierl問世」。</p>
<p>近來，常有愛慕者，向伊求照片，伊總得收取二元的代價，而給與一幀用英文簽着「一個慈善事業的促進者——冰結凝」的六寸半身照。因為這二元的代價，伊也是預備全數捐給慈善機關的。此外，伊每天，還得收到一二十封不相識者的投函，其中也有出於戲謔的。伊收到了這些信，總是說，「這個太淺薄了」，便一笑置之。</p>
<h3>蓮</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>蓮之為花，高澹無上，誠有如周濂溪所謂：「出污泥而不染，濯淸漣而不妖，亭亭凈植，香遠益淸」者·滬上居家，限於地位，無一池半塘以植蓮，乃於庭除間，列一二瓦缸，碧葉絳苞，搖曳於疏簾短箔之際，自僥一種景色·慰情勝無，亦固其宜·</p>
<p>六硏齊筆記有云：「每歲蓮初透水，未及葉際，為驟雨所淋，輒中夭，予出新意，剪荷葉線縫之作兜鍪狀，名曰蓮笠·雨前遍覆之，良有濟也，戲詠之曰：「欲展凌波步，先為行雨裝，璧羅深覆額，擁髻悄藏香·莫倚傾珠蓋，應同裏玉囊·自憐嬌小甚，脈脈待恩光」，使濂溪翁有知，定引六硏齊主人為知己·</p>
<p>種蓮有一秘訣，加豬毛於底，能令花荿·又別蓮花之開否，可視葉面之綠筋，若有二十四條，必開花一枝·又若久不發花，必因肥料不足所致，可擇葉之深綠者，摘去數莖，不使多吸滋養，則發花必速·</p>
<p>昔李笠翁謂：「蓮可目可口，至其可人之口者，則蓮實與藕，皆並列盤餐，而互芬齒頰者也·」高濂四時幽賞綠亦云：「蓮實之味，美在淸晨，水氣夜浮，斯時正足·若日出露晞，鮮美已去過半·當夜宿岳王祠側，湖蓮最多，曉剖百房，飽啖足味·藕以去水為佳，色綠為美」·如此口福，不羨神仙矣·</p>
<p>孫漱石蘭韋謂其少時曾遊也是園，觀並頭蓮·當年諸名士有詩唱和，佳作如林·韻事流傳，迄今尚有能道之者·予家自遷居城南，也是園近在咫尺·惜園歸公產，不容涉足·未知此玉香花影，猶呈瑞異與否耳·</p>
<h3>凉風洞</h3>
<p>— 尚士</p>
<p>諸曁石彭山之凉風洞，為溽暑時之唯一淸凉處。其地離城約二十里，見滿由亂石縱橫，孔隙甚尠。洞踞山之半腰，其側有孤廟一所，荒凉滿目，進數步，卽為凉風洞。洞口不廣，直徑約三尺左右，故入洞時必傴僂以進，漸行漸高，十餘丈後，岩石聳起，較入口更高，可直立。惟其間陰風怒號，寒氣迫人，二三丈後，多不敢前，而岩石嶙峋，支洞甚多，皆昏黑無光。洞且狹，須爬行，具燈火，執繩索，因洞深而盤旋曲折，故必以繩索一端盤洞外，一端執之，隨進隨放，傳出洞時得緣索而返，無迷津之苦。洞因陰冷故雖大暑可在內冰凍食物。若上山時汗流浹背，抵洞頓覺冷氣沁心，須御夾衣，其凉爽蓋可知矣。洞內常有寒氣外溢，遠望迷茫各烟霧狀。近岩崖處，洞濕淋漓，更淸快。土人謂洞極幽深，直通錢江；惟從無人能窮其究竟，故不能證其言之不謬。鄕人關於洞之神話尤多；有謂神仙三十六，當年曾以鳴簫吹笛抵洞者；有謂洞為錢璆王鞭山之亂石所戚者，此皆民間傳說，未可憑信也。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨寄哀吟</p>
<p>雖然那雪白的米飯大碗的盛着，可是决引不起自己的食慾來，只好坐下來，扶起筷子來，先挑了一小夾子白米飯，放到嘴裏去咀嚼着。童老太坐在桌子橫頭，剛把筷子碗扶了起來，見他那補沒有精神的樣子，因問道：你為什麽吃不下飯。國器笑道：今天下午，在學堂吃了回點心。現在到了吃飯的時候，反而吃不下去了。章老太道：吃不下去，就不用吃了。國器道：我只是想用茶泡飯，吃點兒鹹菜。章老太道：你這兩大正是用心思的時候，可是不能多吃，那是最容易停食的。國器這倒不能不心裏一動，慈母算是設想得週到。於是撥掉了半碗飯，將豆腐湯把飯浸得透透的，然後唏哩呼嚕的吃了起來。飯後，章老太道：呌你不要吃，你偏又勉強吃了這大半碗。不要馬上就到書房看書去了，出去玩玩罷，或者找朋友談談心。國器對於母親的話，自然是不便拒絕得，可是自己又十分的意態消極，只好戴了帽子出門，就在附近巷子裏轉轉。自己並沒有怎樣的介意，這兩隻脚却是自然的踏到江家附近的這條巷子裏來。這時，天色已然深黑，那直長的巷子，更顯着幽暗。這市民的住宅區裏，雖是有了電燈，可是幾十戶人家，才有一盞。那一盞電燈，在電燈桿上，又是透露着那焦黃的顏色，在有心事的人看來，眞說不出這是一種什麽凄凉的意味。正這樣的緩緩地走着，心裏很覺不安的時候。旁邊有一扇大門開了。有兩個婦人走了出來。前面二個婦人，手裏捏了一盞玻璃盞子燈，口裏唧咕着道：又要上一趟大街。我們這位小姐又生起病來。只管磨人。後面一個婦人道：你看那後樓，外面就三面是空地。晚上有大月亮，開了窗子賞什麽月。整晚的讓凉風吹着，還有個不生病的嗎？提燈的婦人道：他那裏受了什麽凉？今天下午還出去一趟呢。我看女孩子大了，就都有心事的。他是害了心病。說着話，那兩個婦人就走遠了。那大門半掩着，閃出一線光來。國器仔細打量着，正是江家。因為每日經過附近走十幾條巷子，偶然也走到過這地方來，曾有一次，看到江夢蘭，是在這裏下人力車的。（五五）</p>

<h3>冰結凝廠剪影</h3>
<p>— 玉卿</p>
<p>熱來！又到了冰結凝上市的時節了，的確，在衹是講究吃的上海人看來，好像這個夏天衹有靠着冰來過日子，於是冰結凝就變做為有閑階級高貴人們的唯一的消暑品了。可是，製造冰結凝的工人們卻沒有嘗着冰結凝的滋味呢，雖然在工作時候的汗在流下來。</p>
<p>走過臨半路，走進了××冰結凝製造廠。招徠我們的是一位穿着西服的少年，在來賓參觀的簽名簿上寫下了自己的姓名，就開始參觀。</p>
<p>像爬山跨嶺似的走上了四層樓，是混合間—這混合間就是冰結凝原料配合的地方。不過當我們參觀的時候並沒有看見人在配料，也許是已經停止了吧？祗有二三個工人在收拾地方。祗是聽着那位招待我們的先生的報吿，像學校裏上理化課時候聽敎師講原理也似的，報吿了一番關於冰結凝的配合原料，手續，這裏　附設有一架製造人工白脫油的機器，祗看見像劣等肥皂塊也似的臘黃的東西，不住地在滾出來。</p>
<p>我們又回了下來，走過化騐室，再到冷凝間，這裏就是由混合間導送下來裝置的地方。就所謂是市面上發售的冰結凝。裝包的都是女工，祗見伊們手不停止地在裝置着。據那位招待我們的先生說，冷凝間，共有四座冷凝器，十五分鍾之內每座冷凝器可以製成冰結凝十加倫，每加倫大概可以裝成紙包六打，同時他還說：一天出品至少有一千加倫。由此我們可以想像得到大都會人們的吃的勁道，消費程度。</p>
<p>在歸來的路上，火毒的太陽射在頭頂上，背脊骨，辣豁豁地眞有些吃不消。走過某一個轉灣角子上，看見有一個拉車同胞正在喝着馬路施茶，於是那精緻的飲冰室的一幕複攝的對照鏡頭便湧上了我的腦海。</p>
<p>走進屋裏，臭汗一身。</p>

<p>其實，這是什麽秘訣呢？簡直婦人小孩，沒有一個不知道的。不過大家不肯去照行吧了！那方法便是俗語說的心定自然凉。除去已經有了電風扇冰汽水的閣老們外。這確是一個獨一無二而合於平民階級的經濟消暑妙法，那麽；人們為什麽不去做呢。其實，一個人對於身外來的一切，看得淡些就得了。何必老是弄的心神不定；徒折壽數呢？况且在炎熱的夏天，心神定了，內面凉，外面也凉，不很好嗎？</p>

<p>— 蔡選靑</p>
<p>宋丞相趙葵，溧陽縣人，當時諫臺，奏參其目不識丁，葵憤而辭職，雖奉旨慰留，堅不肯從，歸建水亭二，一在縣北，一在縣南，相距數里，夏日避暑亭內，曾賦句云：水亭四面朱欄繞，簇簇游魚戲萍藻，六龍畏熱不能行，海水煎澈蓬萊島，身眠七尺白暇鬚，頭枕一枝碧瑪瑙。祇吟成六句卽睡去，旁有侍姬蓮香，代續云：相公猶嫌扇力微，行人正在紅塵道。吐屬雋永，雅　鄭家詩婢之風趣矣。予因憶前在軍中十餘年，盛暑行軍，最以為苦，卽求一惡木之陰，暫息而亦不可得，偶見層雲遮日，卽覺有片刻淸凉，當賦句云，當空火繖烈如燒，最苦紅塵行路遙，安得濃雲常蔽日，淸陰四佈暑能消。</p>
<h3>避暑在柯岩</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>紹興柯岩，眞是個淸凉世界，胡天游石簡山房集中，列舉越中石宕，歸美於柯西的七星岩，極言其人工斧　的奇形怪狀，我們倘于夏天入柯岩，旣有淸凉襲肌的石室，復有掩蔽日光的修篁。而碧水幾潭，斷欄數尺，亦復撩人幽緒。然而也很有可議的地方，就在於屋宇的廢敗，淸潔的不講，遊人到此，可以坐臥棲息的亭榭院落不多。日前報紙上面曾載着上海某旅行社提倡到柯岩去避暑；柯岩的石色潭光，陰森寒意，誠然能夠吸引暑天的遊人的。</p>

<p>劣藥現形記</p>
<p>— 南通醫大畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<h3>透膜殺菌藥之失敗</h3>
<p>有住南京路之王君，於近二月前，罹得淋病，先由某庸醫誤行粗暴之手術，繼又介紹伐克辛之內服藥，謂有透膜殺菌之功，王君頗具醫學常識，謂伐克辛為外用注射藥，安可以他人之淋菌內服？遲疑未决，某庸醫仍勸服用，王君不得已而服之，不便反見不利，尿道管閉塞，脹痛欲裂，肛門會陰十分鈍痛，由同事介紹來餘處治療，經用顯微鏡檢查之後，見其病灶上之粘膜淋菌滿佈，有如毛叢。於是以透膜殺菌為號召之劣藥，遂被事實所證明而整個失敗。即施以手術與電氣療法後，囑服「克淋儂」，以驅淋消炎防腐利尿，服至六七瓶後，厥疾始瘳。經用血淸檢查，無淋毒反應，遂證明根治矣。</p>
<p>前南洋醫科大學敎授</p>
<h3>鄭源和醫師肺病瑣談</h3>
<p>診所寗波路四川路口　診時下午四時至六時</p>
<p>要剷除肺癆病灶　第一須堅固肺內之隄防</p>
<p>你生了肺病沒有？</p>
<p>我們談到治療肺病，什麽人都知道須得殺滅結核菌，然後其他各症，才有痊癒可能，這自然是一種根本辦法。可是呢，結核菌要他死，眞是談何容易？因為他外皮是一層脂肪樣的東西，富有抗酸性的能力，無論什麽藥物，都難以滲透進他這層膜質，所以不怕你的藥在理論上講得怎樣好，實際却很難達到殺滅他的目的。</p>
<p>因此，德國有位肺病專家，呌做徒梅的，他是在大學醫科當專門敎授的人。平常總是朝夕想要發明一種肺病物效藥，便根據了結核菌膜質解除後，容易受到藥性的原理，創製了一種脫除結核菌外膜之劑，又把它混合了其他滅菌與增生組織的藥品，經過許許多多消毒手續，製成功「補肺拿爾」一藥。迭經動物試騐，證明有殺菌療癆之力，於是施之肺病患者，一星期內患者痰中的結核菌，即行絕跡，而其他喀血發熱，咳嗽咯痰，盜汗胸痛，食慾减退，體重减損等徵象，也同時逐步减輕，精神漸漸旺盛起來，一兩個之中，肺部有完全治好結疤的。不過本藥須連服半打以上，因為肺病不是一兩瓶所能醫好的。最好同時以此藥與男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」並服，原因是肺病人多有神經衰弱，如心悸失眠健忘等，女子則有月經不調，男子則有腎虧遺精，而此兩藥正能治這些疾患，遺精並須兼服「耐氏育精片」。</p>
<h3>本年霍亂可免　但是—疫痢甚為流行　居民飲食須注意淸潔</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>今年雖為虎列拉週期年，但因為預防得法，或可免除。據衛生當局報吿，疫痢有將流行之傾向，這種痢疾極為猛烈，一經沾染，便有生命之憂，這雖然由於病菌作崇，可是誘因却多係急性胃腸炎之嘔吐下痢所引起的。</p>
<p>急性胃腸炎，就是夏令所常見之病，如腹痛下痢，或是水瀉，一日二三回或數十回不等，嘔吐作噁，見食生厭，發熱，胸部灼熱，很容易轉成痢疾，所以我們應當趕緊防治，在胃腸炎初起的時候，就應該選服消導健運的「強胃精」這是德國赫保寗亞博士所發明的胃腸專藥，能夠淸除胃腸內之腐敗酸酵食物，一經進服，保能痊癒。我近來用此藥治癒的很多，容後繪製表格報吿之。</p>
<p>急性胃腸炎又易於變為慢性，一至慢性，則有胃口不開，見食生厭，胃滯胃呆，食物不化，噯氣泛酸，噁心胸悶，食後脹痛等，而由消化不良引起之大便秘結，痔血，或糞溏洩瀉，多屁，以及小兒吐乳綠便，服此一藥，以改造消化機能，輔給榮養，即能收效，而得按步就班矯除之，因其含有維他命B及其他榮養成分，故善治缺乏維他命B之脚氣症及久病不復原榮養不足等症。</p>
<h3>失孕之原因與治療</h3>
<p>— 鄭源和醫師</p>
<p>失孕之原因甚多，而月經失調實為主因。患者恒有月經超前落後，或子宮大量出血，面色萎黃枯敗，身體殲弱，迎風欲僕，全失康強健美典型，更安有受孕之望乎？從僥倖受孕，其所生之子，亦非夭即病也。</p>
<p>關於此症之處置，宜矯正其卵巢，蓋月經不調，十九皆卵泡之刺激素缺乏也。欲行治療，非增加刺激素不可。「補女容」一藥，係卵巢荷爾蒙所製成。對於因月經不調而來之絕孕症，確有良效。去歲有林太祥夫人，久苦月經不調，腰酸脚軟，婚後四年，迄未一孕，歷經醫治，及遍服中外催孕藥，毫無效果。經人介紹余處醫治，乃囑服「補女容」，約五星期，月經即按期而至，乳房高聳，逾一年而獲一子，舉家皆大歡喜云。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師生殖系疾患講座</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>預提精液——春藥害人</p>
<p>精液是我人之生命線，身體健康與否，全以精液充實與否為斷，然身體健康，精液旺盛，因濫施手淫與房事，結果精液亦必竭蹶，如早洩遺精，陰莖勃起力不全等，皆為精液竭蹶之表現。但患者貪於近利，不圖根本之治療，往往購服從前生殖一類名詞之春藥，預支精液，興奮一時，旋即一蹶不振，茍非予以適當之合理療法，不僅幸福斷送，且人生最大之生殖任務，亦將不能執行矣。因此項春藥流毒甚廣，故時有受害者乞余治療，下述周姓病人即其例也。</p>
<p>數月旣不良，而遺精早洩諸患，又接踵而起。因誤信生殖一類之春藥，服後雖一時感到興奮，但過後即萎頓不振，必重服之而後可，不想連服數星期後，雖投以大量之此類劣藥，一無效騐。始急改投餘處治療，經余用科學方法檢查之後，見其靑春腺均被此類春藥麻痺，形如枯木，除行靜電療法外，兼進大量之「補體康」，以改造其生殖腺之組織，而促生新精液，未及月餘，已完全治愈，一切規復正常，體重增多，重返靑春時代之姿容矣。凡曾服生殖一類名詞之春藥者，均須注意此種不良之惡果也。</p>
<h3>因白帶而使子宮出血</h3>
<p>— 金月仁醫師</p>
<p>一般女子皆以為白帶一病，可以無須醫治，故多忽略，豈知凡是人體粘膜濕潤之處，最易被細菌所托足，至滋生大患。往往因細菌之侵襲，而致子宮大量出血，故子宮與　道，時有潰爛之事。身體日漸瘦削，遂至困憊，向所視為不足重輕之白帶，至此有失生命之危險矣。</p>
<p>關於此患之適當治療，宜投以「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，此片有防腐消炎，鎭痛驅菌之效，不論遠年新起之白帶，用後於三數星期中，即可將白帶排除，局部乾潔如處女。此片妙在患者可向各藥房自行購用，不須醫生指示，有去病之功，而無不良作用，此則久為婦女界中所認識也。凡因淋病而來者，可兼服「克淋儂」，因體處及月經不調等症者，可兼服「補女容」則功效尤為易見矣。</p>
<p>療淋知識</p>
<h3>淋病之根本辦法</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>除了非特殊療法外別無生路！</p>
<p>淋病之為害，已屬盡人皆知，服藥不當，則致變症百出，其最著者，如淋毒性狹心症，心瓣膜炎，關節炎等，或喪失生命，或成為殘廢，危險寧堪設想？故病家選擇藥物，極宜謹愼，以前因淋病並無特效藥，以是應運而產生之各種製劑，日新月異，如透膜殺菌療法，伐克辛注射等是也。余前時曾一度賞用伐克辛注射，（病家注意，伐克辛只能注射，决無內服之理）。迨後見其副作用甚大，往往引起險惡病變，遂中止用此，其時余適從日本帝國醫大返國後，方擬作遊歐之舉，適淋病「克淋儂」一藥發明，其有效成分，即採動植物之胆汁及類脂肪，與旣經提凈之色素，合製為「克淋儂」內服劑，余當即發生莫大之興趣，乃取此供臨床之實習，其獲效之迅捷，藥性之王道，固非一切淋藥所能望其項背，自此藥問世，德國醫院醫師，無不爭先採用，由是而傳遍歐美各國，病家不論男女，均一致樂用此藥，終亦莫不以此而收根治之效也。</p>
<p>依余臨症經騐，淋藥除「克淋儂」外，求效宏質純之製劑，是猶緣木求魚，終不可得。惟「克林儂」乃世界大淋病專家Beide博士所發明，為治各種急慢性淋濁及倂發症之特效劑。但女子可兼外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，則治愈之時日，尤能縮短。「克淋儂」能昂盛人體局部及全身之抗淋免毒喰菌力，服後保奏斷根！</p>

<h3>精神沉鬱由何而起？原因係遺精頻仍</h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>夢遺對於身體與精神上，厥害甚大，最顯著者，為身體瘦削，精神沉鬱，頭痛，頭重，脊痛，生殖器痛，身體疲癆，有強度倦怠之感，其遺精之程度，恒由此加深。陰莖勃起力不足，生殖不能等，亦由此而起，施治之法，宜服「耐氏育精片」以鎭攝神經，鞏固其輸精管，使生殖系之組織，恢復正常，一方多作郊外散步遊行，以愉快其精神，其他對於淫書淫畫，嚴禁勿近，依此妥善治療，則厥病未有不霍然而愈者，余嘗治一方姓病人，遺洩無度，體削眼陷，形狀亟亟可危，因囑往永安公司西藥部購服「耐氏育精片」，呑服未及四五瓶，果霍然而愈，此則事實勝於嚴雄辯矣。</p>
<h3>疾病答問</h3>
<p>會陰脹痛</p>
<p>答程前裕君，足下之淋病放尿不暢，陰莖會陰脹痛，係為劣藥所誤，領毒深入，致變後部尿道炎，及攝護腺炎合倂症，可進服「克淋儂」，以殺菌祛淋，能請姚菊巖醫師檢查治療亦佳。</p>
<p>體重日减</p>
<p>答李君玉君，貴恙已成性神經衰弱，故有早洩不舉之症。又因慮性興奮與精液致脂肪日减，故體重見輕也。除節慾與戒絕手淫外，可投服「補體康」，以壯健神經，而促生殖系之強化。則早洩等病可瘳，體重自亦漸可恢復而增加矣，切忌再服春藥一類之興奮劑，以免陷不能收拾之地步。</p>

<p>失眠本一種病態，但吸食雅片者，十九有失眠之患，是煙毒與神經衰弱，實有莫大之關係，故欲戒食雅片，須先愈其神經衰弱。清其煙毒。此事可於下例證之。</p>
<p>蘇春生君，因患遺精之疾，致入黑籍，煙癮深痼，每夜煢然一燈，非至天明破　不肯罷休，此蓋神經虚性興奮也。身體日弱，近以禁煙雷厲風行，曾戒煙數次，不想戒煙不戒病戒，戒病不戒煙。蓋煙雖戒絶，而厥病復發也。乞余負責戒絶，隨囑往中西大藥房購蛋黄素與内分泌製劑之「補體康」，服用二星期後，煙癮日輕，至朞月而夙　全去，見煙生厭矣。蓋「補體康」有恢復已麻醉之神經，及澄清血液中之煙毒，同時有强壯生殖系之組織效力，故其功效，非一般煙藥可比也。余自陸軍醫科大學畢業後，臨床三十餘年，每用「補體康」戒煙毒者，爲數尤夥云</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>本市求業者突增</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>求業者突增，換一句說法是失業者突增一這是据日前大公報載向職業指導所所得的統計：自本月以來，該指導所得請求談話及申請求職業登記者，日益增加。每日最多者達八九十人；至少也得有五十餘人。平均每日總在六十人左右。据說此所以突然增加的原因，一部份係失業者之謀業，一部份則為學校之畢業生；因本月適値各學校期終了，所以一般修業期滿之學生，均紛請登記，而致數字驟增云。</p>
<p>記得是幾個月前各報曾載有國際勞工局中國分局所發一九三五年的本市失業人數，總計達六十餘萬人之多。若以全市人口三百萬計，那末每五人中有一人是失業者了。但這不過是去年的事，而且他們所得估計的數字是否正確，還是問題。然而在道樣求業者每日五十，一百地驟增的情狀之下，使我們更得看出這失業問題的嚴重性之一般了。</p>
<p>在這里，我們相信今日求業者所以突然增加，大部份是為了各校適値暑假，因致一般修業滿期的畢業生在「畢業卽失業」的情况之下不得不去向「職業介紹所」去先行請求登記，而掛個號了，雖然他們在今日談話，登記完了後，還不知在那一日，那一月，那一年才令有半個位子空出來待他挨進去呢？</p>
<p>但是，失業，失業，這現象却原不是「古已有之」的——要知在那個「茹毛飲血，穴居野處」的原始時代，人類正過着那「共同勞動，共同分配」的集體社會生活；所以，在那時旣說不上有什麼「業」，當然更不會有什麼「失」的了。然而時到今日，隨着資本主義的抬頭與發展，這個現象——失業問題，却成為世界現代各國所不可掩飾的嚴重的社會病態之一。而且，在各資本主義國家的生產方法與財產關係永遠矛盾着的經濟制度一日不變革，不改善之前，這失業現象將一日不會離去。</p>
<p>但是，在我們這個素稱為「地大，物博，民庶」的中國，牠實在談不上是什麼資本主義的「文明社會」，正相反，牠是個十足的半殖民地的社會經濟組織。所以，好多年來，在各資本主義列强相爭着為我們在經濟上，政治上，文化上……作種種「合作」，「援助」，「提携」之下，確實占了他們不少的光。此如本市的所以有成為世界各大商埠之一而榮稱為「東方紐的」就在此。然而，今日之失業問題的所以日趨嚴重，也就在此！</p>
<p>不是嗎？在今日，所謂「東方紐的」的上海，早已遠不如四年來「事變」前的光景了。我們不單是有着幾十萬，幾百萬的失業者被驅逐在飢餓與死之錢上在傾軋，在掙扎，與一般「修業期滿」的學生要遭有「畢業卽失業」的危險，就是一般暫時在業的人們也何嘗不是憂慮着將遭到失業之神的降臨了，不見嗎？農村破產了，都市凋疲着，而工廠相繼倒閉，商店淸理，緊縮，裁員……以至傀儡組織的擴大，」特殊貿易一的猖……等等！</p>
<p>所以，我們相信：不只是上海一市，也不只是「適値學期終了」，這個嚴重的失業人數將要繼續不斷的驟增，延漫，連綿于無止境，要是我們再不急起把這個半殖民地的經濟組織澈底地改造一下的話……</p>
<h3>中國救濟婦孺會留養院訪問記（續）</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>兒童是由該院輔生分組管領的，每人領十名；輔生卽是由該院所留養之婦女中選出者，還有衛生組，專管理淸潔的，分編為甲乙丙三組，每組擔任四小時，但擔任此項工作的也有獎勵金可得。不過，外院的衛生組却是由男生擔任的。</p>
<p>再進去是縫紉間，用了幾個老媽子在縫補破衣的，堆積間，是堆積各種衣服及用具的，左首是外院的浴室，在一個大廳的傍邊，是一個小食堂，凡有傳染病及其他疾病的人，都是在這裏進膳</p>
<p>至於內院；它是在隔壁，和外院及幼稚院都隔籬着的。這裏也有一個食堂，一個浴室，和幾十間臥室。情形是和外院彷彿的，不過設備上稍微有點出入。並且那些女生有的在縫紉機上工作，有的却在刺繡或做其他事情。</p>
<p>到各處去參觀了一週，回到辦公室前的葡萄棚下休息的時候，我又提出了幾個問題，譬如：進院出院的手續，女生擇配的情形，男生的出路，在院時各生學習技藝及生產等。</p>
<p>沛先生的答復：這裏的男女幼稚各生，本來原是由公共租界捕房裏移送來的，所以進院時並無什麼手續，但遇有犯案尙未了結，及尙有其他原因須經庭訊時，則必由院中派人陪往。而進院者亦須經院中一度詳細審問及調查，如其有親戚族人者當着領去，在外埠則由院裏派人送返。倘實在無所依靠了，方准正式留養，不過先要在敎養班裏經過一個月的訓練。至於出院，凡是本入之家族來領，隨時均可，惟本人要求出院者須要在一年以上，並有正當去處者才能允許。</p>
<p>女生擇配是一年舉行一次，但完全徵求本人同意，院中不過是在保護人的地位，其不願擇配者聽便。男生至相當年齡時，由院裏設法介紹以各項職業，或薦至工廠中去工作。</p>
<p>在院時，除一部份派以勞働服務外。女生敎以縫紉刺繡等技能，男生亦有手工之練習，但所作工作均由院中分別給獎，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>院中各生平時絕對禁止離開自己所在之院一步，有事時亦須由輔生陪同到辦公處去接洽，惟輔生及衛生組能在院中自由往來走動。</p>
<p>現在院裏的幼稚生之十七八患均有眼疾，此點我希望該院當局注意。（完）</p>
<h3>西瓜攤</h3>
<p>— 舍利</p>
<p>七月，火熱的天。</p>
<p>人們都揮着汗，不住地搖動芭蕉扇，埋怨着太陽。擺西瓜攤的老五，雖然也熱得渾身臭汗，但他的心里却是愉快的：瞧見那麼大的一個西瓜，切開來不到半點鐘就賣光了，他樂得嘻開嘴儘是笑。他得戚謝這熱天，感謝這太陽。</p>
<p>每個夏天，西瓜上市的時侯，老五的攤子就在這拐灣角兒上出現了。他做這生意已經好幾年，這兒的人他差不多都認識，來買他的西瓜的，都是他的老主顧。</p>
<p>黃瓤細皮大西瓜，</p>
<p>三個銅板買一塊。</p>
<p>老五天天這麼喊着，有好多過路的人，被他這喊聲吸引住了，於是跑過來，扔下三個銅子，買了一塊西瓜捧着吃。老五便越喊越起勁。</p>
<p>今年的天特別熱，太陽的威力就好像要把世界溶化了似地，連馬路旁梧桐樹的葉子也低下了頭。老五用手巾拚命地擦着汗，心里高興地想：</p>
<p>——他媽的，老天做主，這一季賣下來，總可以還淸舊債了罷！</p>
<p>可是，那天早上，當老五又把西瓜祖子挑來，預備擺攤的時候，却發現對面人行道上多了一樣東西，那是一個白漆橱箱，前面寫着很大的紅字：「天津酸梅湯」。橱箱上面用木架子張着篷，還有兩盆盆景，葉子綠茸茸地。一個長子很威風地站在那盆景後邊。</p>
<p>老五的心里徒然不高興起來，簡直是有點憎恨那長子，他不該擺在這兒，搶他老五的生意。但後來他看見那長子的生意並不好，自家雖然比昨天冷落點，顧客却也不少，他先前的憎恨和不高興就消失了。</p>
<p>——瞧你有本領把我的顧客拉過去</p>
<p>他簡直很瞧不起那長子了。</p>
<p>但第二天，他忽然發覺那長子的前後，顧客漸漸地多起來，而自家的攤子就很少有人來顧問。他一打聽，便馬上知道原來那長子把酸梅湯减了價，只賣三個銅板一杯，而且是冰凍的。老五氣得只是乾咕眼，想了想，只好也减價。他拭了拭快要流到嘴角邊汗，發急地喊</p>
<p>又大父甜格西瓜，</p>
<p>只賣兩個銅板一大塊！</p>
<p>這喊聲等於虛空，走路的人連睬也不睬他，就怱忽地走過了；有的却踅到對面去。</p>
<p>——這狗子！簡直是要我的命！</p>
<p>這個仇不報，他還算得個男兒漢？</p>
<p>他把那兩隻眼睛死死地瞅着那長子。</p>
<p>畏子這時候沒生意，也把眼睛瞅着他。</p>
<p>——你瞧我幹嗎？肉他娘的小婊子</p>
<p>那長子走過來了。</p>
<p>——你駡誰，</p>
<p>——罵你你便怎樣？咬老子的鳥去！</p>
<p>他也迎了上來，滿面通紅，微微有點喘氣。那長子一聲也不響，一伸手就是一個嘴巴，打得他退後了一步，他還想衝上來，但，咚！長子兜胸一拳把他打倒了，還帶翻了攤子，西瓜滾了一地</p>
<p>——好！打的好！是好漢你等着，別跑！</p>
<p>他掙扎着爬起來，檢起了地上的西瓜，臨走時這樣說。</p>
<p>——等你媽，呌她來就是了。</p>
<p>那長子冷笑了一下，仍舊回到對面去了。</p>
<p>第二天，老五沒有再來擺攤子，大槪是受了傷，躺在家里牀上吧！</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>接到了法院的判决書，李成第一個急白了臉。他全身像掉到冰窖子里去了似地，只是發抖着。「八個月的房租限期交淸，否則……」李成不敢再那麼殘忍地想下去了。他的心兒猶如被萬千把的刀在割着。他看見他一家六口，年老的媽媽，年輕的妻子，一個沒了父母的姪女，兩個幼小的孩子，現在都被驅逐到街頭上來了，像呌化子那麼地，年老的媽媽只是放開喉管儘是大哭着，孩子，妻子，也都在哭泣着。啊啊！這一幅悽厲的景象在李成的眼前幻映着，李成差點沒急斷了氣。</p>
<p>他的年老的媽媽，他的年輕的妻子，只楞着雙眼呆看着他發急。是的，有什麼辦法呢？錢不是像空氣那麼容易得到的，做賊做强盜，是要觸犯法律的，雖然把錢偷來或是搶來並不是去享樂或浪用，只是為了要把自己跟老母，老婆，自己的孩子們有一所房屋住下罷了呀！可是法律却哪管得你這些撈什子呢？</p>
<p>李成被困窘的現實一脚跌到悲苦的</p>

<h3>重慶的轎夫（上）</h3>
<p>— 自今</p>
<p>—重慶通訊—</p>
<p>『好個重慶城，山高路不平，上坡累得死，坐轎當　雲。』</p>
<p>這是重慶流行的一首俗歌。從這首俗歌裏，你就可以知道轎子在重慶的行的問題上所佔的重要性。</p>
<p>重慶，那是長江上游的一個商埠，在川省更是一個軍事上必爭的險要的山城。從江岸仰望上去，那層層疊疊的城屋市街，都是搁置在峧崖削壁之上，十分的危險，異樣的崇高，生長在十里洋塲的海上的人看見了，卽不興『蜀道難』之感，也會驚駭那是一個地理上的奇蹟。</p>
<p>因為那是建築在山嶺上的一個城池，市街都是坡坎崎嶇，高低不平，走起路來，眞是把你累得死！生長在都市裏的人，要靠自己的脚步來解决交通問題，那不但是有損都市人的體面，而且在時間上也是大不經濟。然而，地理上的關係决定了重慶的命運，不特最新式的流綫型汽車不能從虁門搬運進去行駛，就是用人力拉的東洋車，也不能自由奔馳於那高低不平的市街上，於是應運而生的，就有那一大批批的從農村跑到都市裏來找飯吃的轎夫，他們為了活命，管不得筋骨酸軟，他們出賣血與汗，用轎子抬人來換飯吃，來替重慶解决了這嚴重的交通問題。</p>
<p>重慶的轎夫之多，正如像上海的黃包車夫一樣。這些轎夫，完全來自農村，他們多係鄕村裏的雇農和佃農等，前者給主人做活，（俗稱為帮長年）每年工錢平均不過百吊，工錢高者如所謂『大長年』每年亦不過百餘吊至二百吊，合成川省幣價，每年所入，僅有數元以至十元之微，要是單身漢到還可以馬虎過去，假如家裏有個黃臉妻，或者不幸而生育了三男四女，那他們靠着這幾元錢來維持全家數條性命，那不會餓死，也得將那鳩形鵠面的兒女賈掉幾個。所以，這些雇農在這般慘境之下，就不能不企圖別謀生路，於是，他們就一大羣的跑到都市裏去了；後者和雇農並沒有二樣，他們大多是在高利貸下借來百十吊本錢，向地主佃幾塊乾田乾土，種點雜糧來維持一家幾丁口的生活，年頭兒好，收穫的糧食，除了主人的租糧外，到還可以勉强應付下去，要是遇到災荒之年，或者軍閥們打起仗來，那他們可完了！他們寄托在那幾塊乾田乾土上的希望，完全打成粉碎！不但收穫無望，就是想種植都不可能！然而，主人的租息是要納的，他們在痛苦的呻吟中，也祗有紛紛的離開農村溜到都市裏來，各人帶着一個美麗的希望和快樂的憧憬。</p>
<p>因為需要的關係，前些時這些轎夫在重慶，是佔有頗為重要的地位的，他們來百農村，平時已有抬滑桿的經驗，而且有的是力，所以到了這山城不久，都練得一副驚人的抬轎底絕藝來，他們有一副銅筋鐵骨的腰幹，有一對粗壯堅實的手膊，更有一雙行走如飛的飛毛腿，他們抬轎子的秘訣，是『腰兒要硬，腿兒要軟』八個字。這意思是挺硬了腰身以保持轎子之平穩，活軟了腿子以加强行走之速度，他們在平地行走起來，人坐轎裏，恍如坐了汽車在柏油路上徐駛着那樣舒適。要是上坡，那就是他們大顯身手的好機會，前面一個儘量的用雙手把轎搭由肩部拖曳到背部來，後面的一個就儘量的高舉雙手撑托着後方的轎搭，這樣，就是上登坡坎，轎子也會保持相當的平衡，人在轎中，只是感覺到輕鬆的在向上昇騰，飄飄然如凌虛御風的那麼樣快感。下坡的時候，就是前者舉而後者提，轎子只是平穩的往下墜，有如置身空中下落的輕氣球中，那種快威，只有經騐過來的人才能領味得到。</p>
<p>深淵了里了，一個殘酷的念頭陡地兜上他的心頭上來，「是的，把自己殺死了吧！自己辛辛苦苦終日忙碌着，可是還得不到一餐飽，一宿安呢？」他的淚流下來了，向着他的老母老婆瞥了一眼，在墻角落里，他又看見他的發呆了的孩子們，正用着驚恐的眼珠子瞧着他。是的，他們的爸爸平時是多威嚴呀！可是今天却也像他們往日受了一點怨屈似地哭了起來了。他們哪曉得他們的爸爸此時正在受着碎心的苦痛呵。</p>
<p>可是李成立刻又有一個念頭兜上他的心頭來：「是的！自殺是最要不得的懦弱者的行為，不，是下恥者的行為。一個年靑的人，是始終不會被惡劣的環境所屈伏的，他是應該負有改造環境的責任。是的，我怎末好想到這末一個下恥的念頭來呢？」他把流在面頰上的淚拭乾了。他對他的老母說：（未完）</p>

<h3>遜淸德菱郡主扮演「大地」一主角</h3>
<p>— 萊</p>
<p>賽珍球布克夫人所作「大地」一書，早已遍傳世界，美國米高梅影片公司於三　前開始攝製，曾來華拍取喪機及其他中國民俗，後因導演喬治希爾Goger　Hill自殺逝世，擱淺甚久，數月前始恢復開拍，目下正在積極進行中。現又有一引人注目之消息，卽該片中荷花一角，由德菱郡主扮演之說，合同雖未簽訂，但郡主已在試演中則為事實。據聞德菱郡主曾在法國女伶沙拉班那（Sarah　Bnrnhardt）指導下學過戲劇，也曾隨美國鄧肯女士學過舞蹈，此為好萊塢影刊Cinema載之消息，確吾待攷，苟成事實，則此有關中華國體之女角，將由德菱演之矣。</p>
<p>按：沙拉班那為法國已故女名伶，聲　之大，殆有甚於梅蘭芳之在中國，沙女士演「茶花女」劇。力膾炙一時。至於鄧肯女士為美國古典派舞者之先進，為古典舞鼻祖Wagner之得意門人云。</p>
<h3>歐美報章一致推薦的「小男兒」</h3>

<p>「情愛，和平，動人，美麗……唯奧爾珂德筆底下才能濃郁地煊染這些。」</p>
<p>「萬衆一卷……在銀幕上一樣可以震驚全球。」</p>
<p>「使你會心的微笑……使你不期然的神往。」</p>
<p>「無疑為本年度鉅片之一。」</p>
<p>「是奧爾珂德作品中最可愛最光榮的一部。」</p>

<h3>Yue Army Has Not Entered Guangxi; Guangxi Government Formation Difficult to Realize; Guangxi Decides to Increase Eight and Nine Armies; Various Wuzhou Agencies Move to Guiping; Rumor of Bai Chongxi's Family Arriving in Hong Kong; Foreign Nationals in Qinzhou and Lianzhou Ordered to Leave</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) As of the 2nd, the Yue Army has not entered Guangxi, making it difficult to form a Guangxi military government. The Central Government still wants to resolve the issue through political means. Yu Hanmou appointed the Guangxi veteran Huang Quan Mengzhi as a Four-Route Advisor. Foreign nationals in Qinzhou and Lianzhou have been ordered to leave. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi agents are causing disturbances in various parts of Guangdong. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Various agencies in Wuzhou were ordered on the 2nd to relocate to Guiping. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi has decided to increase the Eighth and Ninth Armies. The commander of the Eighth Army is tentatively set as Li Pinxian, and the commander of the Ninth Army is Yang Zhenxian. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Bai Chongxi's wife, along with her children and more than 30 pieces of luggage, arrived in Hong Kong from Wuzhou on the Jiangning ship on the 2nd. She seems to intend to find a house and reside there for a long time. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guiyang The Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters wired the Central Government yesterday, stating that since the Second Plenary Session, the Central Government's policy for resolving the current situation has emphasized leniency, and it has not investigated the past actions of those who have deviated. However, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have other intentions and have delayed accepting their appointments. They also plan to form a bogus government to encroach on the Guangdong border. Although the Guangxi army in southern Guizhou has withdrawn, it has supplied a large number of funds and weapons to bandits like You Yu Jiu and Cao Tianquan, who are causing disturbances in various counties in southern Guizhou. Wherever the poisonous atmosphere reaches, cities become empty. Their stubborn adherence to their wrong ways and obvious rebellious actions have reached a point where there is no possibility of forgiveness. The Central Government should be requested to immediately transfer the matter to the National Government to issue a clear order for a punitive expedition, in order to maintain discipline and safeguard the nation's destiny. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Air Traffic Between Guangdong and Guangxi Severed</h3>

He visited Li Zongren on the evening of the 1st and earnestly advised him. It is said that Li is determined to go his own way. Li Pinxian's loyal advice was rejected, and he appears to be taking a passive stance and plans to leave Guangxi for elsewhere within the next few days. (2) The bogus autonomous government was originally scheduled to be established on the 1st, but it was ultimately changed to the 5th due to the opposition of the majority of the armed people's militia. 1,500 members of the people's militia stationed in the suburbs of Nanning were disarmed and dismissed on the afternoon of the 1st due to their opposition to Guangxi province colluding with a certain country to harm the country and the people. The deputy commander of the militia, Huang Guicun, was detained. The people's militia in various places are therefore opposing it even more fiercely. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Telegrams Guangxi, Urging Li and Bai to Accept New Positions; Transfers to New Positions Have No Effect; Plans to Visit Guangdong in the Near Future; Eagerly Hopes to Have a Meeting and Conversation</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) Kuling telephone report: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to Li and Bai on the 1st. The original text is as follows: Yongning, Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng, Admiration, I received your secret telegram on the 28th early on, and I have been waiting for your reply, but rumors on the street all say that you two will reject the new appointment and will not hesitate to resort to force, and there is even a rumor that a self-governing military government will be formed on August 1st. These kinds of rumors are spreading widely. I am saddened to hear them, but I do not believe that you two will take such action. Now, the rumor that a government will be formed on August 1st has not been realized, and I am even more confident that you two will be able to love the Party and the country and will never betray the Central Government, so as not to bring shame to the history of the revolution. I sent you a telegram, but I have not received a reply, and you have not indicated that you will take up the new position. My colleagues in the Central Government, and in private, receive telegrams that seem to indicate that you two still have some estrangement and misunderstandings with the Central Government, so I do not hesitate to express my earnest opinions to you two again. After repeatedly reviewing your recent telegrams to the comrades of the Central Government, I have summarized them to be about two points: (1) You believe that the Central Government's transfer of you two to new positions has another purpose. (2) You believe that the National Government's announcement of the new appointments is a violation of the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, and even criticize it as being unlawful and untrustworthy. If you two observe in this way, this is truly a great misunderstanding. First, regarding the first point, I dare to tell you two frankly that the Central Government's new appointments are nothing more than, on the one hand, cherishing your revolutionary history and achievements, and relieving the difficulties of the environment in which you two are situated, so as to give full play to your talents to serve the Party and the country, and, on the other hand, thoroughly realizing the unification of the country, strengthening the unity of our Party, so that people can give full play to their talents and work together in a unified manner to develop strength to resist foreign aggression. If you want to talk about purpose, this is the only purpose. There is not a single word of falsehood in what I said in my telegram. If you two speculate from the perspective of malicious intent, you will be misled by a thousand miles. Moreover, before and after the Second Plenary Session, whenever I talked to my comrades in Guangxi about the Guangxi issue, I always thought that if this continued, you two would have irredeemable suffering, because since June 1st, the number of troops has more than doubled, military expenditures have increased sharply, the price of paper money has plummeted, commodity prices have been shockingly expensive, and society has been filled with sorrow. In addition, conscription of soldiers and grain has aroused resentment among the people. If they do not obey, they are imprisoned, and disturbances occur one after another, and the people are not at peace. Therefore, even if the issue of the military is not discussed, the social economy and the suffering of the people are like this, and I know that you two will not be able to improve the situation. At that time, the Central Government issued new orders for pacification, and at the same time, specially appointed you two as members of the National Defense Council, hoping that you two could come to Beijing to discuss in detail how to deal with the aftermath of the Guangxi situation, but you two hesitated and did not take up the positions, so I transferred Ji Kuan back to Guangxi and sent you two to the Central Government and Zhejiang Province, truly to put myself in your position, on the one hand, I could not but take into account the vitality of the people of Guangxi and the base on which you two have worked hard, and at the same time, I did not want you two to feel that it is not easy to untie the knot of the present national crisis. If things have reached this point, and the Central Government wants to entrust you two with the task of reorganizing the Guangxi situation and taking responsibility to the end, so as to restore the original state before June 1st, it would be forcing you two to do what is difficult. Therefore, this time, the transfer to new positions is really to preserve your good name for a long time, to leave the people of Guangxi with a good impression of you two, and the country can also rely on your talents. The Central Government's painstaking efforts and my sincerity in loving my friends are nothing more than this. If you two think about it calmly, it will not be difficult to dispel the misunderstanding on the first point. As for the second point, the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the orders of the government were all announced on July 13th, but on the 15th, you still held the so-called Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces. You not only did not show any observance of the Central Government's resolutions, but the Guangdong and Guangxi newspapers arbitrarily opposed the Central Government. I repeatedly instructed Ji Kuan, Bo Xuan, and Li Qing to send telegrams to persuade you, hoping that both public and private interests could be taken care of, so that the overall situation could be resolved satisfactorily, but you two did not give a clear reply. Later, although Bo Nan went to Hong Kong, I thought that you two would be able to accept the new position without any hesitation, but my expectations were in vain. Even after Wuo Qi returned to the province, and the order to develop had been issued for more than ten days, you two had not yet taken up the position. The government colleagues believed that you must have real difficulties if you two were hesitating, so they transferred you two to new positions as a place of transition. When the new order was announced, your telegrams expressing your intention to take up the positions arrived at the same time. Although there was a time difference, the Central Government's reliance on you two has not changed from the past. Since you two are willing to accept the previous mandate for pacification, there is no reason why you would not be willing to accept the new mandate. We have dedicated ourselves to the Party and the country, and we have been dispatched to various places. The scope is vast and there are many undertakings. Why must we be confined to a specific region to be able to show ourselves? Delin is serving in the Central Government and making greater contributions. Jiansheng has changed to preside over provincial administration. Zhejiang and Guangxi are both part of the country, so what choice is there to make? Therefore, if you two truly want to show your bright and open mind, to complete the unification and unity of the Party and the country, and to show the whole country the norms of supporting unification and obeying the Party and the country, then all orders should be gladly accepted without hesitation. As for the appointment of local officials, it is originally the authority of the government. The Plenary Session also did not restrict any changes. The powers and responsibilities of the Party and the government have always been stipulated in this way, and should not be regarded as violating the resolutions and criticized as being unlawful and untrustworthy. Since the new order was announced, it has been more than a week, and public opinion throughout the country has hoped that you two will maintain your good reputation and bring benefits to the country. However, you two have not yet shown any sign of accepting the Central Government's new mandate. Instead, I have heard that you are increasing defenses and building fortresses, and mobilizing troops, and there are even rumors that you two have the determination to attack Guangdong and invade Hunan. This is an extremely dangerous plan, and you two should carefully consider it. Whether the Central Government cherishes national power and hopes for peace has long been shown to China and foreign countries, and even the national public opinion will never allow the use of force and self-destruction internally. If you two send troops to neighboring provinces, please note that today's public opinion is definitely not what it used to be. If you enter or leave any province without the Central Government's order, no matter how strong your troops are, you will not be tolerated by the people and will only trap yourselves in a desperate situation. If we claim to be soldiers and citizens of China, then we will not only have no way to go if we do not follow the Central Government's orders, but we will also have no place to stand. Therefore, today we must recognize the trend of the times, respect the power of public opinion, and not rely solely on military force. All of the above, once analyzed, I know that you two will definitely agree with what I have said. However, there may be some who do not speak out, so I cannot but hope that you two will show a willingness to dispel public doubts. In short, the key to our success or failure today must be judged by conforming to reason and circumstances. Any measures that conform to reason and respond to circumstances will not fail. If they are contrary to the great righteousness of the revolution and contrary to the trend of the times, then going against reason and resisting the trend will not benefit either public or private interests. The main reason for this matter must be that we have been separated for too long. I have not been able to convey my sincere intentions to you two, my brothers who have shared life and death for many years, and I am deeply ashamed. I dare to express my heartfelt thoughts and state what I have seen, without concealment or embellishment, in detail to you two. I earnestly hope that you two will consider the interests of the country and the nation, value the sincerity of the Central Government and the expectations of the people, dispel all suspicions, and make a wise decision as soon as possible, accept the new mandate, and express your intention to take up the position, so as to show your true sincerity of being selfless and devoted to the public, and to comfort the eager expectations of the whole country. In the shortest period of time, I also plan to visit Guangdong and sincerely hope to have a meeting and conversation with you two to discuss in detail the full range of issues so that unification can be realized, peace can be achieved, and the country and the local area can benefit, and everything can be discussed thoroughly to formulate a long-term plan for the country, which will also consolidate the foundation of the revolution. If you agree with my humble words, please reply by telegram to show your intent, and I will set off to Guangdong immediately to discuss everything in person. We have shared hardships for many years, and I am confident that we will be able to come together to show our sincerity and comfort the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven. Words cannot express all my thoughts, and I only hope that you will carefully consider them. Chiang Kai-shek, East (1st), Printed. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Rogues Plan to Form Armed Smuggling Groups; Smuggled Goods Piling Up, Unable to Be Cleared; No Shipment From Tianjin to South Via Jinpu Railway for Half a Month</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) No smuggled goods have been shipped south from Tianjin via the Jinpu Railway for half a month. Since the 1st, the Tianjin suburbs of Wuhe have been patrolled by the Water Police Bureau, the Security Command, military police, and customs personnel to crack down on smuggling.

<h3>Current Grain Situation in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the City Grain Association, this year's wheat harvest is extremely abundant, and wheat ships and merchants coming to Beijing to purchase wheat are very enthusiastic. Now the wheat season in the market has ended. This month, the average number of wheat ships per day is one hundred and dozens. Because of the poor sales of local wheat, only a dozen or so flour mills remain in Beijing. The Datong Flour Company has stockpiled 200,000 Zu (a unit of measurement), and grain stores and mills have purchased less than 100,000 Dan (another unit of measurement). Gaorongchang, Chentongji, Yutong, and other grain stores purchased 600,000 Dan on behalf of the Shanghai Fuxing Flour Company. Initially, the price was 4 yuan and 12 jiao per Dan, but now it has risen to 5 yuan and 12 jiao. New grains have entered the market in various places, and many rice ships have arrived in recent days. There are more than 40 rice ships outside the Zhonghua Gate every day, carrying up to 2,000 Shi (another unit of measurement) of rice. There are even more at Xiaguan, so the price of rice has fallen. The current market price for Ju rice is 6 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao per Dan, Huangshu rice is about 9 yuan, and Heishu rice is 10 yuan, 1 or 2 jiao, and the price is likely to continue to fall. New rice from the suburbs of Beijing will be available on the market in the middle of the month, and new rice from Jiangbei and Anhui province will arrive in Beijing in large quantities around the 20th. Shanghai rice merchants have recently entrusted rice stores in Beijing to purchase large quantities of rice, but because the rice stores that stockpiled rice last year have suffered great losses, other buyers can maintain their operations. Zhonghua Gate has always been a rice market, but since the Beijing-Wuhu Railway opened, business has declined sharply, because the rice stores in the city who used to purchase from the grain mills are now going directly to Anhui to purchase, which can save brokerage fees and the expenses of measuring grains.

<h3>The Reality of Rural Revival</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>For years, all Chinese people have regarded relieving farmers as a crucial goal. There are various ways to provide relief, but the ultimate aim is to revitalize the countryside. What is the effectiveness of the implemented plans? It is difficult to predict. However, based on what has been seen and heard, there are things that one cannot help but speak about. Unified marketing is intended to facilitate the sale of agricultural products and to eliminate exploitation by middlemen. The intention is good. However, to prevent investment losses, purchase prices are deliberately suppressed, so the farmers' income may actually be less than before. This is not the original intention of unified marketing. Unified marketing should first promote quality and balance supply and demand so that farmers can avoid unwarranted losses and the countryside can have hope for revitalization. Now, it is often the opposite. Purchasing raw materials at low prices and selling finished products at high prices merely creates opportunities for merchants. As for establishing warehouses to store agricultural products, let's not discuss whether the methods can be better than pawnshops accepting agricultural products as collateral. If the valuation is slightly higher (close to the market price), then losses are expected when the market price declines. If it is lower, how can it be justified to the farmers as not exploiting them? If merchants' goods are accepted to facilitate turnover, it is feared that it will strengthen the merchants and the profits will go to them. When urban financial power suddenly enters the countryside, the environment changes drastically, and the appearance is no longer the same. Without this foundation, wanting to achieve this is like forcibly transplanting foreign rules to China. It is unlikely that it will not be full of setbacks.</p>
<p>Rural investment is not the business of commercial banks. In recent years, they have sometimes hesitated to provide loans for industrial, commercial, and real estate purposes. With no outlet for funds, they are moving towards the interior. This way, they can achieve their profit-making goals and gain a reputation for revitalizing the countryside. Moreover, since it is legally required to invest one-fourth of savings deposits in rural areas, there are no worries about acting in accordance with the law. Even those who do not like operating in this way have to do some token investment to comply with the law. Many people think that investing in rural areas is very safe, but they do not understand that rural lending is a specialized business that ordinary commercial banks cannot handle. Even if it is used as a reserve for savings deposits, there is room for study on whether it is mutually beneficial. In recent years, bank closures have been frequently heard, but how their savings deposits are handled is rarely seen in the newspapers. In normal times, they call for unlimited liability, but the results of their operations are still like this. The rest can be imagined.</p>
<p>This year, farmers seem to have breathed a sigh of relief. This is due to the rise in the price of soybeans and wheat, and its cause is the same as the rise in tung oil last year, coming from abroad. Soybean prices are manipulated by Dalian. In the past year, the price of soybean cake has increased several times. Wheat has been affected by speculation in the futures market and purchases by Japanese merchants, and prices have also increased significantly. Although it is not what flour mills want, farmers are happy. However, price fluctuations are at the mercy of others, and we do not have control over whether prices are high or low. Even if there are gains temporarily, the danger is worrying, because our country, even with soybeans and wheat, is not self-sufficient.</p>
<p>From all aspects, although the call for relief is high, the suffering of farmers has not been eliminated. This is probably due to the inconsistency between theory and practice. Farmers are most conservative, especially in our country. Most of them are uneducated, so new facilities inevitably seem incompatible. Therefore, without in-depth study based on reality, it is not only futile but also causes farmers to feel annoyed and inconvenienced, which is contrary to the original purpose of relief. If we think from the perspective of farmers' actual lives, guide them according to circumstances, and improve things, then there may be hope for successful rural revitalization.</p>
<h3>The Jingqu Railway Officially Starts Construction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jingqu Railway, starting from Xuancheng in Anhui Province and heading south through Quzhou in Zhejiang Province, is now under construction in separate sections. Construction officially began last week and is expected to be completed in three years. As for the Jiliao Railway, it is necessary to cross the Yellow River. If a new railway bridge is built, it will cost a lot. To save expenses, it has been decided to borrow the Jinpu Yellow River Bridge. The joint route starts from Jinan and passes through Changqing, Renping, and other counties in Shandong Province to Liaocheng. The budget is 6 million yuan. The fundraising for the project is jointly undertaken by the Shandong Provincial Government and the Ministry of Railways. Shandong Province has already recruited merchant shares, and the Ministry of Railways is also raising funds. The council is located in Jinan. Surveying will be completed within the year, and construction will be completed in three years. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Pays Attention to the Suffering of Boatmen</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau requested that a new penalty rule be formulated for overdue inspections of sailboats, and that the navigation authorities handle it themselves. The Ministry of Communications replied that sailboats often do not have a fixed freight rate, and overdue inspections are inevitable. To be considerate, the case should be handled according to the severity of the situation, and they should be sent to the court for punishment or warned separately. The navigation authorities should also provide explanations of laws and regulations at any time to make them understand, so that boatmen can reduce suffering. The section on self-punishment is not approved. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>France Asks Britain and Italy to Maintain Neutrality Towards Spain, Otherwise It Will Also Supply Arms to the Country; German Cruiser Sails into Rebel Port</h3>
<p>(Paris) Official sources recently stated that the French government will send telegrams to the British and Italian governments this afternoon, asking them to strictly maintain neutrality towards the Spanish situation and to implement it immediately. Once replies are received from the British and Italian governments, the same request will be made to countries related to the western Mediterranean. The government has now clearly announced that although France previously unilaterally decided to prohibit the transport of arms to Spain, the Spanish rebels are now being supplied with arms by foreign countries, so France believes that it is no longer bound by this unilateral decision. It is hoped that the countries concerned will have satisfactory answers on the issue of maintaining neutrality, so that the current difficulties can be quickly eased, and the international disputes that are already pressing can be avoided. Official sources also said that the French government's aspirations are nothing more than two points: (1) Foreign interference in the Spanish civil strife will have international implications, and this danger should be avoided; (2) The current Spanish government is the legitimate government, which has been officially recognized by various countries. The government is now engaged in suppressing the rebellion in order to restore domestic peace and order, and France should maintain friendly relations with this legitimate government. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The French Embassy delivered a note to the Foreign Office this morning, arguing that the countries along the Mediterranean should immediately establish an agreement to strictly maintain neutrality toward the Spanish civil strife. Because the Foreign Office will not be open for business until Tuesday morning, it is difficult to ascertain the British official attitude at this time. However, people at the French Embassy believe that this note has been sent by the Foreign Office's duty personnel to Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden, both of whom expressed sympathy for it. Some people in diplomatic circles believe that the British government will definitely maintain its original position, that is, the supply of arms to Spain, whether from official or private sources, is prohibited, but ordinary trade between Britain and Spain should not be interfered with.

<h3>France Releases Detained British Aircraft</h3>
<p>Four Fokker aircraft belonging to the British Airways Company in Bordeaux, France, originally intended to fly to the capital of Portugal. When they passed through this port, they were detained by the authorities of the Gironde Province for several days. After negotiations by the British government, the French government has allowed them to fly back to Britain. The aircraft flew from here to London today, ending a dispute.

<h3>Italy Aiding Spanish Rebels, Britain Feels Uneasy; Italy Denies Coveting Morocco</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the matter of several Italian Savoia aircraft flying to Spanish Morocco, well-informed sources here recently stated that the aircraft belong to the country's official air force. It is also rumored that Spanish rebel leader General Franco has reached an agreement with the Italian government, promising certain political interests in exchange for Italian assistance to the rebels. It is most likely that the political interests will be given to Italy in the Balearic Islands. People on the right wing here, who previously sympathized with the Spanish rebels, immediately thought that if General Franco were to win, the result would inevitably have an adverse impact on Britain, so their attitude has changed. In addition, the Italian government is currently investigating the aircraft incident. Once the investigation has results, it will notify France, and the French government will forward it to Britain. Political figures here expect that the investigation results will not be satisfactory. As for France's intention to convene a conference of countries related to the Mediterranean, including Britain, France, and Italy, political figures still believe that it is better to conduct talks through diplomatic channels than to convene a full meeting. If a full meeting is held, it cannot be successful unless Russia and Germany participate together. However, the two countries are in opposition to each other, so it is difficult to ensure the conference's success. In addition, France has also suggested convening a conference of countries that guarantee the neutral status of the port of Tangier. This is also opposed by political figures, because Spanish warships are allowed to refuel in British Gibraltar, but it is unfair to prohibit them in Tangier. In short, Britain and France are currently closely linked on this issue. The future trend will be determined by the results of Italy's investigation of the aircraft incident. Political figures also pointed out that the British and French governments have agreed to prohibit all arms from being transported to Spain, while ordinary commercial goods can be freely exported without restrictions. This can be seen from the fact that the four Fokker aircraft belonging to British Airways Company have been released by the authorities of the port of Bordeaux, France, and returned to Britain.

<p>(Paris) It is widely rumored here that the Italian Fascist Party has reached an agreement with the Spanish right-wing rebels. If the Fascist Party succeeds in this revolution, Spain will cede a port in the Balearic Islands to Italy. Since the Italian bomber crashed on the Moroccan border on July 30, the panic of international disputes has been increasing. (1st Day National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign newspaper published a statement by Spanish Foreign Minister Basilio, saying that Italy has coveted Spanish Morocco. The Italian newspaper here recently published an article refuting this statement, saying, "No one in our country has any intention of interfering in Spanish Morocco. It was like this in the past, and it is still the same now. The Spanish Foreign Minister's slanderous remarks give our country reason to refute them." In addition, rumors that Spanish rebel leader General Franco is willing to cede Ceuta to Italy as a reward for Italian assistance to the rebels have also been denied by the newspaper. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tetouan, Spanish Morocco Spanish rebel Chief of Staff General Armada recently told our reporter that the Italian aircraft that landed in French territory did fly to Spanish Morocco, but their purpose was to transport Italian expatriates back to their country. Our reporter questioned why so many machine guns were found in these aircraft. General Armada replied, "I have said everything I want to say, and I do not want to elaborate." Our reporter then asked when the war would end. General Armada replied, "The reason why we have not won a great victory immediately is due to Soviet interference and the failure of a part of the navy to respond. But our army will launch a major offensive soon and will win a complete victory." Our reporter saw seven aircraft parked at the airport here, two of which were German Junkers, and one was Italian Savoia. It is not known whether there are other aircraft parked in the hangar. Our reporter then went to Ceuta and encountered ten trucks full of foreign troops heading to Ceuta. It can be seen that General Franco is indeed planning to transport foreign troops to mainland Spain by sea or by air. Although Ceuta has been bombed by government warships and aircraft in recent days, it has not suffered major damage. (2nd Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish left-wing government is furious today because foreign aircraft are helping the rebels resist the government. The authorities here warned other countries that neighboring countries that help the rebels will be considered an act of war or will trigger a European war. The left-wing newspaper "Claridad" also said today that the rebels may hope that Fascist countries will provide assistance, and specifically named Portugal, Italy, and other countries. At the same time, the government ordered all administrative staff of universities and middle schools to be dismissed and replaced by new people appointed by the Ministry of Education within two weeks. The Ministry of the Interior ordered soldiers not to freely supplement or search private residences. Travelers returning here from Guadarrama reported today that the battle there was fierce and similar to the situation during the European war. (1st Day National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid Foreign Minister Basilio recently told the press that after Ambassador to Italy Di Castelci and Ambassador to Germany Godinho successively resigned, the government ordered Ambassador to Switzerland Arciniega to be promoted to Ambassador to Italy, and Minister to Norway Miskovic to be transferred to Chargé d'Affaires to Germany.

<h3>The Spanish War is in a Stalemate on All Fronts; Government Forces Make Slight Progress; Rebels Eagerly Await Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Madrid The government claimed victory today on both the northern and southern fronts. Although the rebels have controlled some provinces, they have still not broken through the gates of Madrid. The rebels have also failed to defend Albacete to cut off Madrid's food supply, which is a mistake. (1st Day National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid Since the outbreak of the rebellion, the northern city of San Sebastian has experienced fierce fighting, and foreign expatriates have fled. Our reporter was able to enter the city with great difficulty and sent a telegram saying that although the city is still in a state of war, streetcars are running as usual, but few shops have reopened. Governor Adora told our reporter that the rebels are still entrenched in Pamplona in Navarre Province. They previously attempted to seize Irun, Oyarzun, and Renteria, but were repelled by our troops. They then attempted to attack government troops down the Oria River, but were also unsuccessful. As for the government troops' battle plan, they are currently planning to form two columns to advance towards Pamplona and Logroño in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In addition, the situation in Valencia Province in the southeast is stable, as is Catalonia Province. The government troops in that province, starting from Barcelona, are now approaching the rebel base of Zaragoza. In short, the government troops will surely win, it is only a matter of time."

<p>Barcelona Huesca is still occupied by the rebels. Government troops are advancing towards the city, and the outposts are only four kilometers from the city. An attack will be ordered today or at the latest tomorrow. (2nd Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid Two trains loaded with military supplies from Alcázar to Valladolid were bombed by several government aircraft. The boilers of the two locomotives were hit and exploded, and all the vehicles derailed. All the military supplies on board exploded. The aircraft then flew back to Valladolid and bombed the rebels, setting several fires in the city. (2nd Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Regarding the Spanish war news, there were no major developments between the government forces and the rebels last night. Both sides seem to want to avoid a decisive battle at present and are only engaged in strategic arrangements in order to wait for the opportunity to move. The rebels obviously want to link up the northern and southern fronts and attack the capital Madrid from both sides, while the government forces are sharpening their swords and preparing to meet them head-on. This is the main point. The rebel radio station in Seville broadcast a very simple message last night, only saying that there was a small contact between the two sides in the Somosierra and Guadarrama areas north of the capital, and the situation did not change. It also said that the security team in Castellón Province in the east had indeed rebelled. On the other hand, the Madrid government issued a message saying that the government forces had won a slight victory. It also said that although the security team in a village 100 kilometers from Avila had rebelled a few days ago, it surrendered to the government yesterday. The security team in the village of Ispor in Granada Province also surrendered to the government forces. According to non-official sources, the village of Sastaigo near Zaragoza has recently been recaptured by the government forces. Also, the government troops led by General Asensio are now only eight kilometers away from Granada Province. (2nd Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Swedish Merchant Ship Found Carrying Arms</h3>
<p>(Paris) A Swedish merchant ship recently anchored in the port of Sète in the Hérault Province and was scheduled to sail to the Canary Islands in Spain (one of the rebel bases in the Atlantic) on the 3rd of this month. Officials discovered that the ship was carrying 15 tons of explosives and 50 kilograms of bomb detonators. The local Spanish consul has asked the Madrid government for instructions on this matter.

<h3>Communists Cut Off Fascists' Heads</h3>
<p>Gibraltar British expatriates from Malaga and other small cities arrived here yesterday on the British destroyer Greyhound. It is said that Spanish communists, in order to save ammunition, only used knives and axes to cut off the heads of captured Fascist Party members and threw the bodies into the sea. Many headless bodies have been found along the coast of Malaga. The government forces intend to attack La Línea, San Roque, and Algeciras within days, so the Spanish Communists have to try to save ammunition for the war. Travelers from Tangier said that foreign airships often arrive at Moroccan ports, especially in Melilla. It is said that foreign troops are now being transferred daily by the rebel leader General Franco to Valencia. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Torpedo Boat Defects to the Rebels</h3>
<p>Gibraltar Last night, a Spanish torpedo boat, without a flag, entered the port of Algeciras. Judging from its actions, it seemed to be surrendering to the rebels. A few days ago, a government airship was forced to land in Gibraltar. The rebels sent two representatives from La Línea to the area to contact the airship's pilot, claiming that if all the crew members could surrender, then their family members who are being held by the rebels would be safe and unharmed, otherwise they would be executed in the future. However, the pilot has not yet responded. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Sudanese Articles Signed, Stipulating Joint Administration System</h3>
<p>Cairo Regarding the various military articles of the new treaty negotiated between Britain and Egypt, an agreement has recently been reached. Subsequently, negotiations on the Sudanese issue continued, and an agreement has also been reached, and a preliminary signing was held yesterday, stipulating that the Sudanese region should restore the Anglo-Egyptian joint administration system before 1914. The Sudanese region, south of mainland Egypt, along the upper reaches of the Nile, was originally part of Egypt. After 1899, it was changed to Anglo-Egyptian joint administration. In 1924, Britain recognized Egypt as an independent country, and at the same time regarded Sudan as a British colony. (2nd Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Minister Will Urge Cabinet to Implement Innovative Administration, Believing it is the Remaining Mission After the Military Purge</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Expanding armaments, thoroughly purging the military, and reforming the administration are the three major missions declared by Army Minister Terauchi, who took office after the February 26th Incident. This regular military reshuffle was also carried out from the perspective of thoroughly purging the military, making considerable sacrifices. Regarding the declaration at the time of taking office, there is no regret in the implementation. However, the Army Minister's plan to thoroughly purge the military was originally intended to be realized simultaneously with expanding armaments and reforming the administration. Only by integrating the whole can its significance be expressed. Therefore, regarding the realization of reforming the administration, it is considered that it is extremely difficult to implement only by the army. It should be a prerequisite that the entire cabinet has the determination to implement it. However, regarding the expansion of armaments, the army has established a new twelve-year national defense enrichment plan, and the 3 billion yuan required for the first six years has been roughly grasped. The army has notified the government of this situation. In view of the current international situation, the army believes that this level of military expansion is a minimum estimate and should be realized. Therefore, the army, taking the February 26th Incident as an opportunity, has now begun to implement the purge and expansion of the military, and has established its own policy. The only remaining part is the part recognized by the government or the financial authorities, which will be a matter for the future. The Army Minister is gradually realizing the purge and expansion of the military, and the only remaining issue is the reform of the administration, which is his mission. However, the army's hope for this matter is the reform of administrative institutions, the stability of national life, and the establishment of a national policy towards Manchuria. The army has already notified the cabinet of the above-mentioned matters in official documents. However, regarding the comprehensive control and planning of national policy, the government has not yet decided on its attitude. Therefore, Army Minister Terauchi's hope for the Hirota cabinet to reform the administration is extremely strong. He will earnestly urge the government to make a decision and implement it.

<h3>Japanese Economy: Plans to Develop in the South Seas, Stating No Ambition to Expand Territory</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese diplomatic work is based on maintaining and developing the people's livelihood, centered on the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, and focusing on adjusting diplomatic relations with China and Russia. However, South Seas policy is also an important part of diplomatic work. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to adjust the relationship between various policies and achieve unified diplomacy, will establish a South Seas Section within the Eurasian Bureau in mid-September. Japan's South Seas policy has no territorial ambitions, and is only based on economic development. It goes without saying that it will avoid unnecessary oppression of the South Seas islands and handle all issues with a peaceful attitude. The implementation of the South Seas policy must consider the positions of Britain and the Netherlands, which have Australia and the Dutch East Indies as their background, and its countermeasures are extremely cautious and calm. Recently, proponents of Japan's southward advance policy have been loudly advocating the South Seas policy, causing Australia and the Dutch East Indies to feel threatened, making it difficult for the Japanese government to take a stand in this regard. In view of this fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided on a policy to implement a unified South Seas policy. (2nd day Allied News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Uchisawa, the Consul-General in Manila, the Philippine Assembly is currently deliberating on a number of bills that have a significant impact on Japanese companies, goods, and exports to the Philippines. Although most of them were proposed by government representatives, they seem likely to pass the Assembly and become law. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very concerned that the implementation of these laws will have a significant impact on the 30,000 Japanese residents in the Philippines and the annual exports to the Philippines, which amount to 50 million yuan. It has ordered Consul-General Uchisawa to actively lobby to prevent their passage through the Assembly. If these laws are enacted, their implementation requires the approval of the President of the United States, so Japan still has room to negotiate with the US government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also believes that since Japan's exports to the Philippines exceed imports by 30 million yuan annually, it will not rely solely on protests to deal with the Philippines. It plans to use economic cooperation to ease Philippine sentiments. (2nd day Allied News)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Outer Mongolian Relations: Russian Ambassador's Speech at Oxford</h3>
<p>(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky recently delivered a speech at the Oxford Summer School, referring to the relationship between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. He stated, "The Soviet Union has no imperialistic intentions towards Outer Mongolia. What it is promoting is a socialist policy. Therefore, Outer Mongolia also views the Soviet Union with goodwill, and a genuine friendship between the two countries has emerged spontaneously." Maisky then described the Soviet Union's assistance to the Outer Mongolian Revolutionary Party in transforming the country, saying that the Soviet Union's actions were devoid of any profit-seeking motives. "There used to be commercial relations between the two countries, and there still are, but these are normal trade relations based on the principle of equality. An examination of the profit and loss figures of Russian-Mongolian trade will reveal that the Soviet Union actually suffers more losses than gains." In short, Russia and Mongolia have no mutual exploitation, and their relationship is completely new, created only after the establishment of socialist countries. Therefore, Mongolia's friendly relations with the Soviet Union are a matter of course. Even now, when facing external threats, it turns to the Soviet Union for help, as it did in 1921, there is nothing surprising about it. Russia and Mongolia fought together fifteen years ago, resulting in a sincere friendship. In March of this year, they signed a mutual assistance pact, which is nothing more than a reaffirmation of this friendship, with no other intention." Finally, Maisky mentioned the Anglo-Russian naval agreement, saying that it could be signed soon. (2nd day Havas News)</p>
<h3>Military Purge Changes and Coups (1)</h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>One of the special products of Japanese politics after "May 15th" is the "military purge." Minister of the Army Hayashi caused a huge disaster for the sake of the military purge. Now Minister of the Army Terauchi is also working hard on this, which makes every Japanese person, every person who cares about Japanese politics, inevitably ask in unison: Is a "military purge" possible? Who is the target of the "military purge"? Will it cause waves similar to the "February 26th" incident?</p>
<p>Although "changes" are periodic, they have become an indicator of Japanese political trends since Minister of the Army Hayashi took office and demonstrated his personnel skills. Before each "change," there are many news reports speculating about it. After it is announced, tens of thousands of people discuss and criticize it. Minister of the Army Terauchi has made many decisive personnel changes since taking office. It is said that "the August 1st change is the key to past changes. It will point out to us the extent to which the "military purge" work has been achieved and what the political significance indicated in the list of "changes" is. If the military is considered the core of exploring Japanese politics, then understanding the lineup of the military after the "changes" and the political trends presented by that lineup is indeed a necessary and essential common sense for the people of the Republic of China at this stage.</p>
<p>The mission of the Hirota Cabinet, from the day it received the mandate, was "military purge" and "international coordination." When the cabinet changed its chief of staff, it replaced "international coordination" with "renewal of all government affairs." "Military purge" has been on the main agenda of policy implementation since the establishment of the Saito Cabinet, but because of Araki Sadao's sharp edge, he did not dare to touch it. The Okada Cabinet, which changed the soup but not the medicine, touched it and provoked a coup that "aggravated the Emperor's concerns." Now the Hirota Cabinet dares to take on this task, which seems incomprehensible. "Renewal of all government affairs" is what Hirota dared to say and write, borrowing the courage of the military. He dares to give scathing criticism to past cabinets, at least the Saito and Okada cabinets, which seems incomprehensible. However, if we connect these two incomprehensible things, we will understand at a glance. "Military purge" and "renewal of all government affairs" are related. The day the "military purge" is completed (?), should be the time for the Hirota Cabinet's "renewal of all government affairs." If "military purge" cannot renew all government affairs, there will inevitably be a force like Mount Tai pressing on Hirota's back, which is the "coup." Here, we should quickly state to our readers: In "good neighborly relations" with the same race and culture, "coup" does not necessarily require the actions of Shiro Nonaka-style Showa Bushido. Even the change of cabinet can use this startling term. Therefore, from "military purge" to "changes," and from "changes" to "coup," I am afraid that it has already been predetermined in the fate of the Hirota Cabinet, hasn't it?</p>
<p>Since these three questions have become the core of exploring Japanese politics at this stage, should we discuss them in detail from all aspects? That is necessary, but there is no such plan in this article, because almost all other issues related to it have been discussed in the previously published "Where is the Hirota Cabinet Going?". Now, exploring from the point of view of the rise and fall of military factions, it may be possible to say what others have not said, and it may be more suitable for the appetite of those who care about Japanese issues.</p>
<p>Usually, what we call the military is limited to a corner of the army. Why do we disregard the navy? Doesn't Navy Minister Nagano's purge of personnel from the "National Polity Clarification Faction" count as a "military purge"? If it should be included in the military's "military purge" curriculum, why don't we compare it with the army's? This is one of the mysteries of Japanese politics at this stage. Minister of the Army Araki Sadao exhausted all the brains he could think of in the indictment of the "May 15th" incident, using all the words lacking "loyalty to the Emperor and love for the country" in "Words of the Sea" to describe the actions of Lieutenant Kiyoshi Koga. But Navy Minister Uneo Saneomi looked for words in the legal code. During the "February 26th" coup, Miyakezaka became the place where the rebels visited, and the leaders of the rebels, Takashi Muranaka and others, openly handed the "Statement of Intent" and the requested conditions to the "Emperor's" officials. The navy, on the other hand, had no interest in such compromise. Upon hearing the alert, it immediately recalled the training fleet to guard the harbor. On the day of the crisis, it also dispatched marines from Yokosuka to advance towards the capital, causing the Keihin tram to be shut down. After the coup, the so-called "army generals" were busy with the aftermath in the Kaikōsha, and the attitude of General Terauchi, recommended by Minister of the Army Kawashima, became a difficult obstacle to the Hirota cabinet. The navy, however, was very moderate in dealing with it. This shows how different the political attitudes of the army and navy are in the military. The reason for the difference lies in the disparity in tradition, education, etc. This cannot be explained in detail here, but it is enough to point out to our readers that there is a reason why people use the army to represent the military.</p>
<p>No one dares to say that the navy has no factions. Because the terms "Fleet Faction" and "Land Faction," "Militaristic Faction" and "Civilian Faction" are often found in Japanese publications. This kind of factionalism in the navy does not have much impact on the political stage, but the army is not like this. People will use the personnel work of Major General Nagata, the tragic protagonist of the "February 26th" incident, to create the term "Military Purge Faction," etc., in addition to the Araki Faction and the Uga Faction. But from today's perspective, it seems that understanding the lineup of Araki and Uga simply, and understanding the activities of the middle faction—such as Kenkichi Ueda, etc.—makes it easier for us to grasp the position of the military in Japanese political struggles.</p>

<h3>Emperor Haile Selassie's Ambition Undiminished: Still Striving for Restoration Movement</h3>
<p>(London) Since attending the League of Nations General Assembly at the beginning of last month, the Emperor of Abyssinia has left Swiss territory and is residing here as an exile. Today, he gave an interview to a reporter from the Sunday Chronicle, stating, "I will not give up my ambition to struggle and fight for the independence of my motherland. When I was in Geneva, I submitted a draft resolution to the League of Nations General Assembly, requesting a loan of ten million pounds. Although it failed, the road to borrowing is still not closed. I have formed a committee here to be in charge of debt raising. The results achieved recently are very good, which is enough to invigorate us. Many of my troops are now scattered in the northern and southwestern parts of Abyssinia. From now on, their food and ammunition will be adequately supplied.

<h3>Death of French Airplane Manufacturer: The First Person to Fly Across the English Channel</h3>
<p>(Paris) The world's first seaplane aviator, Louis Blériot, passed away here today at the age of sixty-four. Blériot was born in 1872. He studied the design of aircraft structures in his youth, invented a bird-type aircraft, and won a prize of 100,000 francs from the French Academy of Sciences. In 1909, the London Daily Mail offered a prize of 25,000 francs, seeking aviators to make a non-stop flight across the English Channel between sunrise and sunset. Blériot made his own plane and completed the feat on July 24 of that year, becoming the first person to fly across the English Channel. (2nd day National News)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous French airplane manufacturer, Bleriot, recently passed away here at the age of sixty-four. He flew a self-made small airplane (with an engine of only 35 horsepower) across the Strait of Calais on July 25, 1909. He was the first person to fly across the sea in history. He then devoted himself to the airplane manufacturing business. During the European War, he invented a type of heavy bomber that could rise to an altitude of 6,000 meters, which was a miracle at the time. After the war, he devoted himself to studying the manufacturing method of high-speed airplanes that could ascend to the stratosphere, and also made many contributions. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is a pioneer in the aviation industry. (2nd day Havas News)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous French aviator Bleriot, the first person to fly across the English Channel, died of illness here today at the age of sixty-four. Bleriot is like the Lindbergh of that time. When he flew across the English Channel in 1909, his great achievement and dangerous feat were the same as Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic in 1927. Although the two events are eighteen years apart, the names of Bleriot and Lindbergh will be closely linked and shine in the history of aviation. The two men successively achieved great achievements that seemed impossible at the time, and both directly promoted the progress of aviation. It is said that Lindbergh's dedication to aviation was partly motivated by Bleriot's early achievements. In the year Lindbergh became famous, Bleriot's feat had become a daily occurrence, and the progress of the aviation industry was also very rapid. Bleriot was born on July 1, 1872, in Cambrai. His father was a manufacturer, so he came into contact with machinery in his childhood. When he grew up, he studied at a specialized school and obtained an engineering degree. After completing his military service, he served as an artillery officer in Tarbes. In his spare time, he liked to study the structure of automobiles. After several years of experimentation, he invented a car searchlight in 1896. Four years later, the diagram of the famous aircraft built by Ader was displayed at a meeting in Paris. Bleriot was moved by it, so he abandoned the automobile and studied the aviation science that was still in its infancy at that time. Bleriot was determined to make a practical airplane, and he almost forgot to eat and sleep, experimenting more than ten times. The capital he had obtained from his car searchlight was almost completely lost. In 1906, with the help of two friends, he founded the first airplane manufacturing factory in France. On September 17, 1907, Bleriot's dream came true. On that day, he flew his self-made monoplane for a distance of 186 meters. Afterwards, he gradually improved, and other young aviators and manufacturers also came to him. On June 27, 1908, Bleriot flew bravely and won the "Starter Award" of 1,200 francs (equivalent to 10 US dollars). On October 31 of that year, Bleriot made his first long-distance flight, flying from Toury to Artenay, a distance of 60 miles. He stopped once in the middle, and the world was amazed, because at that time, it was almost unbelievable that he could land and take off again with this wonderful machine. The following year, Bleriot conducted a major pre-war aviation experiment, announcing that he would fly across the English Channel on July 25, which shocked the crowd, and many were worried about Bleriot, but Bleriot actually flew from Calais to Dover on that day. The French government sent the destroyer "Escopette" to guide him. At the time, no one expected that Bleriot's speed would exceed that of the destroyer. Bleriot's plane initially flew above the destroyer, but then seemed to be disturbed by the thick smoke emitted by the ship's chimney, so it flew slightly out. As a result, the plane gradually flew forward, and although the destroyer "Escopette" tried to move forward, it could not keep up. Bleriot's plane finally completed the 38-kilometer strait between England and France in 38 minutes. Bleriot's great achievement won him the prize of 1,000 pounds offered by a London newspaper to the first person to fly across the strait. When Bleriot arrived in England, he was warmly welcomed everywhere. When he returned to Paris, his countrymen also held a grand parade to welcome him. The French government also congratulated Bleriot and awarded him the honorary rank of military officer. The plane he flew was on display, and he accepted an invitation from the United States to perform aviation technology. Several years later, Bleriot began to recall the dangers he encountered when flying across the strait, saying that landing was actually unsafe, because he had to inspect the white rocks along the coast of Dover for more than ten minutes before he could identify them. Bleriot had repeatedly encountered dangers when flying for the first time, and his self-made airplane had also crashed many times during test flights. His most proud achievement in his early years was when he was able to stay in the air for eight minutes in a strong wind in July 1908, and in June 1909, he broke the record for staying in the air for a long time three times in a row. The first time he stayed in the air for 18 minutes and 30 seconds, the second time for 36 minutes and 55 seconds, and the third time he reached 50 minutes and 8 seconds. Between 1909 and 1911, Bleriot flew through the capitals of various countries many times, and devoted all his efforts to training young aviators to continue his career. He himself specialized in airplane construction. During the European War, the airplane factory he operated supplied thousands of airplanes to the French and Allied forces. Later, he manufactured a large number of airplanes for French military use. (2nd day Reuters News)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Shen Bao newspaper, from Kaifeng: Recently, we read in your newspaper about the Yellow River breaking through the Guantai levee. This is not in accordance with the facts. The Guantai closure dam has already accumulated six to seven hundred meters of dry beach towards the river. It is still two to three li away from the main current, and the water has not yet flooded the beach. How could there be a breach? A couple of collapses occurred recently due to the sandy soil, which is inevitable given the years of decay in the willow dikes of the Yellow River embankment. We have ordered the River Bureau and the Fengqiu County government to immediately mobilize laborers to reinforce the earthworks and complete the repairs. There is no dangerous engineering to be addressed. Furthermore, the Guantai closure project was completed in April of the 24th year of the Republic and was inspected and accepted by officials dispatched by the National Government. It was then handed over to the Henan River Bureau for reception and management. This was reported long ago. Years have passed, and the Henan River Bureau is fully responsible for the repairs and maintenance. As the safety of the dikes is concerned, please check and correct your report to clarify the true situation. This is our earnest hope. Yellow River Conservancy Commission, East.</p>
<h3>Travel Journal of Japan (11)</h3>
<p>— Shen Bao Reporter Hu Zhongchi and Hu Yizang</p>
<p>In the reception room of the Editorial Bureau, we met with Mr. Kamio Shigeru, head of the East Asia Department, reporter Hongo Gaichi of the Communications Department, and pilot Shinno. Mr. Kamio and Mr. Shinno met when the Asahi visiting aircraft arrived in Shanghai last year. Mr. Hongo is a reporter stationed in Beiping who recently returned to Japan. With the guidance of these three friendly colleagues, we gained a general understanding of the internal organization of the Asahi Shimbun. (Note) In the middle of the conversation, Mr. Kamio asked us a question: "Why do your people always look forward to the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars?" "How strange! Where did you hear that? We believe that at least the general intellectuals in our country definitely do not want our two neighboring countries to go to war. Because everyone knows that once a war breaks out, we will become the second Belgium." This was our reply.</p>
<p>We talked with the three Asahi reporters for half an hour. Then, an Asahi employee responsible for "annai" (guided tours) accompanied us to visit various departments within the company. The Asahi Shimbun is a cultural institution that Japan can be proud of. Any group that visits Osaka must visit it. Therefore, there are visitors every day, especially during the so-called tourist season between spring and summer. We followed a tourist group from the countryside and a group of elementary school students, following the designated tour route step by step, passing through many corridors with iron railings along the walls. These corridors are half-wall high and are specially designed for visitors. Each department also has wooden signs hanging high, with simple explanations, also specially for visitors. First, we saw the photo telegraph machine in the photo telegraph room. This is said to be the world's most sophisticated Si Du Jia Luo Lusi·Tai Leifen Gen-style machine, connected to ordinary telephone lines, which can freely send and receive photos. The photos taken from this machine are almost as clear as negatives. Then we passed the entrance of the Editorial Department and visited in accordance with the newspaper production process. The work efficiency of each department is very high, the mechanical equipment is also very new, and the tidiness and cleanliness of the factory are particularly worthy of our admiration. In the vast printing room, twenty-one new printing machines are lined up one after another. At the front end, extremely long belts made of constantly rotating steel sheets receive the newspapers printed from each machine and transport them to the distribution department. Among the printing machines, there are four Asahi-style electro-optical rotary machines, which were custom-made based on the Asahi Shimbun's technical experience and have a particularly large printing capacity, capable of printing 160,000 large sheets of newspapers per hour. In addition, there are all American-style ultra-high-speed transfer machines.</p>
<p>After the normal tour, with the guidance of Mr. Hongo, we also visited the Editorial Bureau. Hundreds of people gathered in an extremely spacious hall, working separately. This is the busiest time for the Editorial Bureau, because the first edition of the next morning's newspaper must be printed by 8 PM, and sent by overnight train to distant places. After that, the edition must be changed at any time to insert newly arrived news. Most of it will not change (morning and evening editions are published many times every day, with the English letters on the newspaper corner indicating the edition). In our opinion, the vitality of their work function is simply comparable to the headquarters of a large army in modern warfare. They often send planes to distant places to investigate news, and use carrier pigeons to send letters to remote areas. They communicate with Tokyo and Fukuoka at any time through Asahi's dedicated long-distance telephone line. They are also in very close contact with other departments within the company. The Editorial Bureau is equipped with a vacuum transport machine that connects to many departments within the company. This machine is used to send manuscripts to the typesetting department. However, in a department like the Editorial Bureau, the spirit of work is ultimately more important than material equipment. Regarding this point, the impression we got was the orderliness of the organization and the strictness of the organization. In addition, we also saw four "Editorial Guidelines" posted in high glass frames on the wall for everyone to follow:</p>
<p>Asahi Editorial Guidelines (Translation)</p>
<p>First. With the aim of maintaining the eternal imperial foundation, we will strive for the peace of the country and the happiness of the people.</p>
<p>Second. We will guide the people's thoughts well, make the culture new every day, contribute to the prosperity of the national fortune, and accompany the progress of the world.</p>
<p>Third. Without bias or partisanship, we will not forget the concepts of fairness, impartiality, justice, and humanity. We will comment prudently and appropriately, and report accurately and quickly.</p>
<p>Fourth. The articles on the page should always be fresh, but we must also consider the impact on society. We will maintain a faithful and profound style, and never fall into frivolousness.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Underway, Japanese Troops Constantly Conducting Exercises in the Suburbs of Beiping, Preparations for the Construction of the Cangshi Railway, Japanese Military Attaché Discusses Economic Issues, Japanese Advisors Hired by the Hebei-Chahar Council</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the stationing of Japanese troops in Beiping and Tianjin was completed, the Japanese soldiers stationed in Fengtai have been frequently dispatched in teams to conduct exercises in places such as Lugou Bridge, with a constant number of about one hundred people. On the 27th, several dozen Japanese soldiers stationed in Fengtai went to Beiyuan for exercises. At that time, a unit of the 29th Army was also conducting exercises in the same area. The two sides were very close, and conflicts almost occurred during their respective exercises. The Japanese side is expected to make some representations about this. The Foreign Affairs Committee also had a secret discussion on this matter during its regular meeting on the 28th. Subsequently, the person in charge of the committee explained everything to the Japanese side, and this matter is expected to be concluded. On the evening of the 28th, a Japanese elementary school student riding a bicycle on the Diplomatic Corps Street was beaten for not having lights and disobeying police orders. As a result, a small disturbance was caused, which has not yet been resolved, but it is not expected to cause a major problem.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Cangshi Railway, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee previously ordered Pan Yugui to be responsible for the preparations. The construction cost estimated by Pan is about 40 million yuan, while the railway authorities estimate it to be more than 30 million yuan. The Transportation Committee held its second regular meeting on the 28th and put forward this case for detailed discussion, but no concrete results have yet been obtained. The Economic and Transportation Committees are currently working together to devise a plan. However, this matter is also within the scope of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China. Whether it will be handled independently by our side in the future, or whether it will have to wait for Wang Kemin to come north to negotiate joint operation with the Japanese side, is still uncertain. Mr. Wang was originally scheduled to return to Beiping in July, but due to environmental reasons, he failed to do so. It is difficult to predict when he will be able to come north in the future. However, it is heard that powerful figures here have made proposals for Mr. Wang to preside over the Economic Committee, and Mr. Wang is also concerned about the scope of the Economic Committee here, fearing that it will cause many inconveniences in future work. This is also one of the reasons for his delay in coming north.</p>
<p>At the reception with Chinese and foreign reporters on the 31st, Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai Takeo talked about economic issues. He said that the Japanese side hopes that China and Japan can promote economic cooperation and development. If this can be done, the Japanese side is willing to do its best to help. The Hebei-Chahar authorities are currently hoping to carry out work, and the Japanese side has expressed its goodwill towards them and is willing to help them achieve this goal. However, the economic development of North China is not possible with empty words. It must be promoted step by step. It is believed that our expectations can be achieved. It has not yet been heard where to start, but North China is the oldest land in China and has thousands of years of history. Therefore, if you want to do something, it must be in accordance with habits. If you do things in a special way, it may be difficult to achieve success. He also said that on the evening of the 29th, Chairman Song and Matsumuro Takayoshi invited Chinese and Japanese officers to a get-together, and on the evening of the 30th, there was a banquet for the Chinese and Japanese academic circles, which was of great benefit in spirit. My feelings about these two get-togethers can be summarized in two points: 1. Existing misunderstandings can be eliminated. 2. Psychology can be clarified and ideas can be connected. The Japanese garrison headquarters in Tianjin expanded its organization on the 1st. Kawabe and Matsumuro were both summoned by Japanese Army Commander Tashiro to Tianjin on the 1st for consultations.</p>
<p>The Japanese advisors hired by the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee are as follows: Nishida Koichi (former Consul-General in Jinan) as diplomatic advisor, Nakajima Daisaburo (Lieutenant Colonel) and Sakurai Tokutaro (Major) as military advisors, Saji Daiji (former Director of the Tokyo Telegraph and Telephone Bureau) as transportation advisor, ×× Takagi Daisan as advisor, and Yamazaki Ginji as Beining Railway Bureau advisor. It has been decided that Nishida and others will take office on the 1st.</p>

<h3>Kunshan Economic Construction Association Established</h3>
<p>The branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee of this county has been officially established on the 1st after active preparations by the county government. Twenty-six heads of various agencies, groups, and schools have been hired as committee members, and twenty-four people including Wu Baofeng have been hired as commissioners. Chen Shouhe, Huang Zhenhuan, and Shen Guixiang have been appointed as secretaries, and Yang Chuanru has been appointed as director of the general affairs section. Chen Shouhe also serves as the director of the executive section. It has been determined that June 1st and December 1st of each year will be the dates for the general assembly.</p>
<h3>Changshu Epidemic Still Prevailing</h3>
<p>Although the weather here has recently turned cooler, epidemics are still being discovered, especially the Bie Luo Sha (sudden infant death) disease. Xia Zhixing, who lives in the Land Temple in the north gate, fell ill in the afternoon of the 1st. His whole body was ice-cold, and he died at about 4 o'clock, which was extremely rapid. Although the Public Security Bureau is planning to establish an epidemic prevention hospital, the budget expense of 650 yuan per month for the use of the reserve fund has not yet been approved by the Finance Department after being submitted, resulting in the delayed opening of the hospital. The public is eager for the hospital to be established as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>
<h3>Car Station Chief Replaced</h3>
<p>The Tanghu Automobile Company started operating on August 15th last year. Because the Changshu station controls the Shanghai, Wuxi, and Suzhou lines, the position of station chief was filled by Xie Xian, the younger brother of the Construction Department Chief Shen Baixian. It has been more than a year since then. Now, the company has transferred Shen to serve as the Shanghai station chief and dispatched Zhu Duanfu to Changshu to succeed him. The two sides are scheduled to take over the matter on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Three Fugitive Thieves Captured</h3>
<p>The home of Chen Xiangchun, a resident of Chen Lane, Zhangjiaqiao West, outside the South Gate of the Second District, was robbed last year by more than a dozen thieves who took away a box gun, a pistol, and a rifle, as well as many bullets, 170 yuan in cash, and jewelry, resulting in huge losses. Subsequently, the Detective Team of the County Public Security Bureau cracked the case in Hushu Pass, Suzhou, and arrested four bandits, Tao Yalin, Chen Heshang, Yu Rengen, and Zhu Zengxiang. One box gun and one rifle were recovered and transferred to the court for interrogation and custody. Zhong Jihe, the captain of the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau, continued to hunt down the fugitive thieves in this case. The day before yesterday, he led detectives Wang and Dai, as well as several detectives, to Youchepang, West Street, Hushu Pass, Suzhou. He remotely saw four small boats parked in a row, with bright candlelight in one of the boat cabins, offering sacrifices to the god horse, with three animals and fresh fruits. Captain Zhong and others rushed to ambush them. At that time, three male bandits, as well as women and children, were captured and bound. A Brownlin pistol was found in the cabin, which was the original stolen goods from Chen Xiangchun's home. They were all taken back to Wuxi, where the team interrogated them. The three thieves, Zhou Heshang, Chen Jinsheng, and Zhu Fusheng, confessed that they had robbed Chen's home. According to the confession, the County Public Security Bureau will transfer them to the court on the 3rd for interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>Guiding Autumn Silkworm Affairs</h3>
<p>The autumn silkworm season is about to begin. The silkworm demonstration area in this county has prepared for autumn guidance. The locations and candidates for the guidance stations in each township have also been determined. A letter was sent to each guidance station the day before yesterday, scheduling them to report to the demonstration area on the 3rd. At 8:00 a.m. on the 4th, a departure guidance meeting will be held. On the 5th, they will all depart and go to each township to prepare for all autumn silkworm guidance matters. The date for the distribution of autumn seeds is approximately around the 20th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Three Farmers Injured by Electric Shock</h3>
<p>She Sanbao, She Fengbao, and Zhang Fubao, farmers in Dagojia Lane, Changshou Kunshan Township, Third District, were working on the mountain at about 4:00 p.m. on the 30th when a sudden thunderstorm struck. With a thunderclap, all three were electrocuted and fell to the ground. Sanbao's hair and pubic hair were burned off, and his chest was scorched. Fengbao's right eyeball was damaged and protruded. Fubao was less severely injured. All three were sent to the Dongwai Gospel Hospital for treatment. The lives of two of them are in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Nantong Socialite Sentenced for Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Fang Yu, a famous socialite in Tongcheng, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau for selling drug pills. The maid Chen Ma was also arrested. The two of them pushed the blame on each other, and the case was unresolved. The special commissioner's office is now clearing up the backlog of cases. The Provincial Government has dispatched Pan Bingying to Nantong to sort them out. Fang Yu and Chen Ma have each been sentenced to seven years in prison.</p>
<h3>Court Promotion and Inspection Transfers</h3>
<p>Hong Xiheng, a judge of the Nantong District Court, has been ordered to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court. Jiang Nongquan, a judge of the Qingjiangpu High Court, has been transferred to Nantong. Prosecutor Liu Shiqing has requested leave, and Lu Qi, a prosecutor of the Songjiang District Court, will temporarily replace him.</p>
<h3>River Collapse and Embankment Breach Rescue</h3>
<p>Tongyi has been experiencing violent storms and the river tides have risen sharply. The Yao Port river embankment has collapsed sharply. The residents of the polder are using sandbags to urgently block the breach and are working in shifts day and night to rescue it.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang New Grain Entering the Market Situation</h3>
<p>The autumn rice harvest in the provinces of Upper Jiang is abundant, and rice boats are arriving in Zhenjiang one after another. The north of Jiangsu Province has also announced a good year. The new grain has already entered the market. Even the rice market in this city has seen a price drop, decreasing by about one yuan per stone compared to a few days ago. When the new rice floods in the future, the price will definitely drop sharply. As for the price of wheat, because of</p>
<p>the rain during harvest, the wheat was moldy, and the harvest was slightly inferior. Therefore, the drop is limited.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Court President Requests Resignation</h3>
<p>Guo Wei, president of the Jiangdu District Court, requested his resignation from the High Court because he wanted to return to his native Changning, Hunan Province. Guo has now notified the accounting office to complete the handover procedures. However, it is not yet known whether the High Court will approve his resignation.</p>
<h3>District and Town Conflict Case Transferred to the Province</h3>
<p>Tang Zuomin and Wang Jiading, two assistants from the Fourth District Office of this county, brought along household registration police Hua Yizhi, Wu Xianjie, and Zhu Xiangzhong on the 18th of last month to collect the fourth installment of opium suppression licenses in Xiannv Town. When they checked the home of the opium addict Fan Jinhao, they saw Jiang Shoushan, an opium addict who had already quit. Tang and others believed that Jiang was suspected of relapse and that Fan was evidence of supplying people with opium. As a result, the two sides argued with each other. The town chief of the town, Wang Zhuyu, heard about it and brought along the town's militia to track them down and question Tang, asking why they brought so many people to the town day and night without notifying the town chief and entering people's homes to search. Therefore, Town Chief Wang believed that Tang and others were suspected of extortion and bribery, while Tang and others believed that Wang was guilty of obstructing official duties. As a result, the two sides clashed with each other, almost resorting to violence, and the situation was extremely serious. The county government heard the news and summoned both parties to the government for investigation for more than a month. Because the case was complicated, all the witnesses, including Tang Zuomin and Wang Zhuyu, were sent to the province the day before yesterday with a written statement. After careful investigation by the Zhenjiang Garrison Command, Wang Zhuyu was released on bail, while the rest were detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Luhe Expedite Citizen Registration</h3>
<p>The matter of citizen oath registration in this county was previously ordered by the Provincial Department to be completed by August 15th. Now, because the time is pressing, County Chief Qi convened a temporary meeting of district chiefs for discussion in order to actively carry it out. After the meeting, it was resolved that the deadline for investigating citizens would be August 4th, the deadline for citizen registration would be August 8th, the citizen oath date for each township would be August 12th to 14th, and the date for each district to report the number of citizens who have taken the oath and to send the citizen roster would be August 15th. After the resolution, the county government issued a notice to the district chiefs to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Performing Obscene Plays</h3>
<p>In Houzi Township, Third District of this county, some people recently collected money to perform obscene plays. The county government has sent police to investigate and prohibit it. Unexpectedly, the villagers, without fear of the law, actually led a group of actors to hide in Donghe Township in this district during this investigation. Zheng Birong in the township took the opportunity to advocate collecting money from door to door and performing on a large scale. The local Bao chief not only did not stop it but dared to protect it. County Chief Qi learned that this was true through investigation and secretly dispatched the judicial police to rush to investigate and arrest them overnight. Zheng Birong, who took the lead, and the Bao chief who shielded the performance were arrested and sent to the case to be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Reclaiming Sanmen Bay Project</h3>
<p>To develop Sanmen Bay, the construction authorities have decided to first select those projects that are simple to construct and effective to implement. The plan to build a sluice gate and road in Che'ao Port requires 160,000 yuan, which can reclaim more than 5,000 acres of arable land, save about 60,000 acres of farmland water conservancy on both sides, and save about 15 kilometers of pond bank repair. The project is funded and constructed by the farmers themselves. It requires 28,000 yuan to build a dike, enclose the crossing, and set up sluice gates for cultivation. It can obtain 4,000 acres of mud land. Furthermore, the Jiangshan mud dike needs 11,000 yuan to build a dike and sluice gate, and reclaim more than 1,000 acres of mud land, which can be used as a small commercial port. The funding for other port water conservancy projects such as Yishi Jian Tiao Hu Zhu will be raised by the benefited farmland.</p>
<h3>Fire Kills Four People</h3>
<p>At 1:20 a.m. on the 2nd, the home of Zhang Guanzhao, a resident of No. 214 Xia Yangshi Street, Hangzhou, was destroyed by a fire caused by careless use of mosquito coils, which spread to the houses. Zhang, his wife, and son were all awakened in their sleep but could not escape in time and were burned to death. A 12-year-old girl from the opposite surname also died tragically in the fire. More than a dozen houses were burned down, with losses exceeding 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: The Number of Smokers in the Anti-Smoking Center Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Since Yin County launched a general investigation into opium addiction on July 26th, all smokers found have been sent to the district anti-smoking center for verification. Moreover, the number of opium offenders sent from various counties has surged. The district anti-smoking center is already unable to accommodate them. Forty opium offenders were transferred to the detention center of the local court for custody. However, the number of arrivals far exceeds the number of departures, and there is still a feeling of not being able to accommodate them. Therefore, yesterday, eleven opium offenders, including Zhang Deren, who had already been sentenced, were temporarily released on bail.</p>
<h3>A Woman in the Countryside Gives Birth to Quadruplets</h3>
<p>In Zhongshan'ao, Lianshan Township, Fenghua, there is a farmer named Bao Lichen who married Chen from the same township. She is over twenty and has already given birth to a son, who is now eight years old. Last year, she became pregnant again and carried the pregnancy to full term. The day before yesterday, she experienced severe abdominal pain, and a midwife was called to assist with the delivery. After a short while, she gave birth to a daughter. However, the abdominal pain did not subside. Soon after, she successively delivered two more daughters and a son. The three daughters all died shortly after birth, while the boy's cry was very loud. Because the incident was unprecedented, it caused a sensation far and wide.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation by Railway and Highway</h3>
<p>The Caoyong section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, in order to facilitate passengers, plans to implement joint transportation with the Xiaoshao and Caogao Xin two highways. All joint transportation methods have been agreed upon by both parties and submitted to the Railway Bureau for approval. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 15th, but due to lack of time, it was rescheduled to start on August 1st. It is now known that the Railway Bureau yesterday issued an order to all relevant stations of the Caoyong section to comply with the relevant regulations.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Manufacturing Den Discovered</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Public Security Bureau's Detective Team received a tip on the 29th, stating that someone was manufacturing red pills at No. 317 Guijia Lane, Jiangbei Shore. At 2:30 PM, detectives were dispatched, along with the Fourth Branch Bureau Chief and police, to investigate the address. Because the reported address was based on the old system, which had long been abolished, a search was conducted door-to-door. Subsequently, two red pills, half a can of white powder (raw material for making red pills), and scattered items used for making pills were found in the room of Yang Xiufu and Yang Xiaoshuai, residents of No. 418 Houmalu, who were from Huangyan. Yang et al. and the landlord Hu Yuzhao were taken to the team for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Iron Ore Discovered in Changxing</h3>
<p>Changxing is surrounded by high mountains and ridges, and its resources are very rich. The Changxing coal mine has long been mined, yielding considerable profits. Recently, another iron ore deposit has been discovered near the Lijiaxiang Shishan. After expert analysis, it is considered to have abundant components and excellent quality, and it is predicted that it can be mined for more than a hundred years. Currently, Yan Yusan and Shen Chunshan of the county plan to jointly form an alliance with industrialists in Shanghai to submit a request to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Military Affairs to invest in mining.</p>
<h3>Bank of Korea: Expanding Operations in North China, Assisting Economic Development by Directly Circulating Japanese Currency; Japanese Military in North China to Make Water Conservancy a Prerequisite for Economy</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Japanese Bank of Korea is expanding its operations in North China to complete its central economic development agency. The plan has been roughly finalized. However, in order to suit the deployment plan, Director Matsuyama has been specially sent to North China for inspection. Matsuyama came to Tianjin in the middle of last month and investigated in Tianjin for about a week. He has now transferred to Qingji and is scheduled to return to his country in the middle of this month to report to the head office. According to sources here, the Japanese side is quite concerned about the risks of investing in North China and is worried about any instability in the currency, which could affect the entire plan. Therefore, it intends to use the strength of the Bank of Korea to help make Japanese currency directly circulate within Hebei and Chahar, so that economic development can be guaranteed and the promotion of all enterprises can also achieve complementary effects. If this kind of conspiracy is realized, the so-called economic development of North China can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Bank of Korea itself does not have this motive. It is entirely encouraged by the Japanese military. In the future, it plans to expand the original two branches in Tianjin and Qingdao into branches, set up branches in Pingji, and set up sub-branches in Tongzhou, Tanggu, and Tangshan. In addition to the purpose of promoting the direct circulation of Japanese currency in the market, it also operates savings, mortgages, and loans. Regarding this matter, according to observations in the Tianjin financial community, North China is a silver-using area, and its currency system has not deviated from the central government. Although there are now more types of paper money in circulation, they are all guaranteed by the legal currencies of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and the people do not feel any inconvenience. If the Bank of Korea is allowed to circulate Japanese gold-based currency on the market, the result will be that the price of legal currency will be subject to fluctuating effects, and eventually it will become a case of the tail wagging the dog and being manipulated by others. Therefore, the authorities should pay serious attention to this matter and should not allow it to circulate vaguely.</p>
<p>The Japanese Garrison Headquarters in North China hired Dr. Sakamoto, a famous water conservancy engineering expert from Japan, several months ago, along with three of his assistants. After three months, they traveled to Baotou, northern Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar, and inspected the upper reaches of the Yongding River, as well as the upper and lower reaches of the Hai River in great detail. Last week, they completed a dredging plan for the two rivers. After going to Jinan to meet with the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe in Shanghai, he returned to his country. The Japanese Garrison Headquarters relies heavily on him and wants to use the plan he developed to first dredge the two rivers as a forerunner for developing the economy of North China, so that there will be no water disasters along the two rivers, and the effect of irrigation can be achieved through water conservancy. The fertile fields along the river can all grow cotton, and the Japanese textile industry can then obtain raw materials, which can be used inexhaustibly. The benefits of economic development can be enjoyed once and for all. Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Japanese Garrison Headquarters, once told Chinese reporters about this matter, saying, "Although there is talk about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, no concrete plan has ever been drawn up. The Japanese Embassy and the North China Garrison Headquarters have not convened any meetings to prepare. Although the Japanese side plans to invest tens of millions of yuan in North China to develop mineral resources and water conservancy, if China, as the owner, is not willing to accept it, the Japanese side will not force it. Japan's real purpose is to restore North China to its prosperity ten years ago, and to restore the people's purchasing power to the past. At least they must have the same ability as the people of Manchuria, so that the Japanese economy can be developed and national defense can be indirectly consolidated. Dr. Sakamoto, the water conservancy expert currently hired by the military, has decades of water management experience. The Osaka water conservancy was built by him. After investigating the Yongding River and the Hai River, he said that he is very confident that he can manage them well. The military will definitely support his plan and take the lead." From this, we can see the direction of the Japanese side's emphasis on economic development. (August 1st)</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Mayor Wu said in his speech, "Distinguished guests, team members, today is the day of the graduation ceremony for the first class of trained citizens in Shanghai. This ceremony has given the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai a profound impression and a new concept of the country. There are two purposes for the government to train citizens across the country. The first is to strengthen the physical fitness of citizens, and the second is to tell citizens across the country to develop good habits of observing discipline. These two purposes cannot be achieved without training. Everyone knows that to build a modern country is not something that can be done in a short period of time, nor can it be achieved by the efforts of a few people. To build a modern country and maintain national independence, it is necessary to have a strong physique and habits of discipline. Citizens are directly responsible for building the country. They have obligations to the country, and the country has rights to them. Citizens must first fulfill their obligations before the country has the right to give them. The greatest obligations of citizens to the country are military service, labor service, taxation, and education. If they can obtain the qualifications of citizens and fulfill these obligations, the country can be built and can survive independently. In order to strengthen the ability of the people to build the country and strengthen the ability to maintain national independence, the government has selected people with citizenship qualifications for training to strengthen their physique and develop habits of discipline. We know that to build a modern, independent country, individuals can enjoy a peaceful life and make the nation prosperous, and that it is impossible without every citizen fulfilling their due obligations. You are citizens, and the government wants you to participate in building a new country, so you are required to receive training. Training can not only increase the ability to build the country, but also increase the ability of the essence. You are engaged in agriculture, industry, and commerce in Shanghai. We must make efforts in our respective positions. In the future, the results will not only make our careers successful, but also have a great impact on society and the country. We must have a sound physique and a spirit of discipline in order to undertake major events and not be afraid of difficulties. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be lacking for your own careers. The customs and habits of the city are different from those of the countryside, so the physique and morality of urban citizens must be trained even more. After graduation, do not forget the lessons learned during the training period, and always maintain the spirit of training, so as to build the country, save the country from disasters, and make your own careers successful."</p>
<p>Guest Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "I am very happy to participate in the graduation ceremony of the first class of trained citizens in this city today. I deeply hope that citizens with training qualifications will actively participate in the training, and I hope that all graduates will always maintain the spirit of 'straw sandals to save the country' today, and move forward in the mud to defend our country and be a model citizen." Chu Minyi then gave a speech, hoping for a consistent will and action, working hard to be self-reliant. Finally, the team member representative Tao Gongxuan gave a reply and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Silk Exports Expected to Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Commercial Inspection Bureau Inspects Grades; Can Compete with Japanese Silk</p>
<p>Raw silk was originally a major product of our country. However, due to backward production technology, Chinese silk has plummeted in the world market. Since the authorities have actively promoted reform, progress has been made and production has increased. Moreover, the consumption power of raw silk in various countries around the world has gradually increased again. Therefore, last year's silk prices rose, reaching a maximum of more than 1,000 yuan, which was rare in recent years. Therefore, the export of Chinese silk has also gradually turned for the better. According to the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, observing the situation of the only raw silk consumer country in the world, the United States, last year Japanese silk imported into the United States was 46,124,600 pounds, an increase of about 5% compared to 42,238,000 pounds in 1934. The amount of consumption was 47,117,100 pounds, which was also an increase of 480,600 pounds compared to the previous year. Therefore, silk prices rose accordingly. As for the export of raw silk from our country, it has improved from extreme decline since the second half of last year, and exports have increased sharply. This year, farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have increased silkworm farming and have a bumper cocoon harvest. The export of Chinese silk is also showing a booming trend. From June 1st last year to the end of May this year, 25,265 bales have been shipped to the United States, and the total silk export is 56,025 bales, an increase of more than 30% compared to the same period last year. In early July, foreign silk prices were affected by the good situation in the New York Stock Exchange, and silk prices rose day by day. This spring, rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were helped by loans from the Farmers Bank, and the road ahead was very strong. Silk prices are firm. If it is not affected by other factors, the future of the silk market this year is expected to not fail. However, attention should be paid to the inspection of raw silk grades. If the goods are uniform, they should not be affected by the exclusion of Japanese silk.</p>
<h3>National Sugar Production and Sales Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Retroactively Approved and Amended Article 21 of the Articles of Association; Three Internal Groups Started Working Immediately</h3>
<p>After the election of directors of the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association, the association was originally scheduled to be established on August 1. However, due to the fact that Chairman Feng Rui was in Guangdong and could not come to Shanghai, the establishment was delayed. Now, because all parties are expecting the association to be established quickly, the board of directors decided to hold an inaugural meeting at the Dianchuntang Sugar Shop on Fuyou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Yuan Liang, retroactively approve the amended articles of association, and officially start working on the same day. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday, representatives from sugar factories in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Shandong provinces, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, the Sugar Industry All-Group Company, Xiehe, Heyuan, Yuansheng, Daxing, Yuda, Henghexing, Shenghe, Dachang, Yuantaiheng, Taiji, Shihe, Zhonghe, Yukang, Xiesheng, Yufengheng, Fangcuihe, Baohe, and Tongfengxiang and other sugar dealers, as well as the directors of the association, Yuan Liang, Lu Zuofu (represented by Zhang Shulin), Feng Rui (represented by Lin Qunyi), Zheng Zenan, Chen Yuren, Yang Wenshao, Lang Guangrui, Shi Yucun, Huang Jiangquan, Jiang Yachen, Chen Xinfu, etc., and Zheng Lai (represented by Huang Guoen), Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Liang Hejun, Chairman of the Food Sugar Management Committee, Zhu Changnian, Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of the Sanbei Company, Chen Yiting, Member of the Municipal National Goods Promotion Association, and more than 100 people, and Yu Pu, Chief of the Yemiao Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, led police officers to protect the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Yuan Liang was publicly elected as chairman and Xue Meiting was the master of ceremonies. After performing the ceremony, the chairman first gave an opening speech, saying that he was very honored that the association was established today and that the competent authorities and various groups had sent personnel to participate. Sugar is the second largest import of our country and is one of the necessities of life. The annual sales volume is about 20 million dan. In the past, most of it was supplied by foreign sugar. Now, our country, seeing the huge leakage every year, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Sichuan and other provinces have successively planned to set up mechanized sugar factories to recover interests. According to what I know, ten years ago, the statistics of sugar consumption in various countries, every year per person, the United Kingdom was 90 pounds, the United States was 70 pounds, Japan was 40 pounds, and China was 2 pounds. Recently, China has increased several times, so we must work hard to revitalize domestic sugar. The first is "production", and factories should be set up to improve manufacturing. The second is "sales", and we should find ways to promote sales. The purpose of this association is to seek the production of domestic sugar and develop sales power. I hope we will sincerely unite and jointly shoulder the responsibility of production and sales.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Then Zheng Zenan reported on the preparatory process, saying that in November last year, Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Forestry Bureau and General Manager of Guangdong Sugar, passed through Shanghai and talked with Shanghai sugar merchants about the proliferation of domestic private sugar and the increasingly dumping of foreign sugar, and that the sugar factories in Guangdong had gradually increased their sugar output, which had met the needs of the Chinese people. In order to prevent smuggling and dumping of foreign sugar, he proposed to form a production and sales group organization, which was supported by the government and prepared to organize the "China National Sugar Production and Sales Association." After active preparation, 14 people including Huang Jiangquan had been elected as directors of the association, and Feng Rui had been appointed as chairman. The articles of association consisted of ten chapters and twenty-five articles, which were passed by the general meeting of members on the 29th of last month and submitted to the Food Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee for registration and approval by the Ministry of Finance. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held on August 1, and Chairman Feng Rui was telegraphed to fly to Shanghai to preside over it. However, Chairman Feng Rui was busy with trading and could not fly to Shanghai, and various matters of the association needed to be handled quickly after the establishment, so the inaugural meeting was specially held today.</p>
<p>Retroactive Approval of the Articles of Association</p>
<p>Except for Article 21, all the articles of association of the association were passed by the general meeting of members on the 29th of last month. Now, Article 21 is specifically revised to "The resolutions of the general meeting of members of this association must be carried out with the attendance of more than half of the member representatives and the consent of more than half of the representatives. If the number of attending representatives is less than half, a provisional resolution may be carried out, and the results will be notified to all representatives. The general meeting of members will be reconvened one week later, within two weeks, and a resolution will be carried out on the provisional resolution with the consent of more than half of the attending representatives." The motion for retroactive approval was resolved to pass the original text. However, in order to avoid disputes between production and sales in the future, it will be submitted to the board of directors for research and remedy.</p>
<p>Speech and Notes</p>
<p>After passing the motion for retroactive approval of the amended articles of association, Liang Hejun, Chairman of the Food Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee of the Ministry of Finance, gave a training speech, saying, "I am ordered by the government to manage the transportation and sales of food, and I have unlimited feelings about the establishment of the National Sugar Production and Sales Association. I am impressed that sugar factories and sugar dealers across the country can unite and assist the government to prevent smuggling. After smuggling is eliminated, domestic sugar can be revived. Therefore, the government expects your association to succeed very much, and at the same time hopes to improve sugar making and sales, so that foreign sugar will not be dumped into our country's market again, which is fortunate for the country and fortunate for the people." Then Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, represented Huang Guoen and Yu Qiaqing Chen Yiting and others gave speeches, and the speeches were omitted for length. Finally, Yuan Liang gave a thank-you speech, photographed and had tea, and the meeting dispersed at 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>Official Office</p>
<p>The association is divided into three groups: general affairs, administrative affairs, and financial affairs. Lin Qunyi is the director of general affairs, Zheng Zenan is the director of administrative affairs, and Shi Yucun is the director of financial affairs. The association will officially start working today. The address of the association is in the Shanghai Sugar Industry Joint Company on Minguo Road. The association will issue a certificate to prove the legitimate transportation of domestic sugar after verification.</p>
<h3>Machine Federation Regularly Inspects Factory Equipment</h3>
<p>Inspect Once a Week</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency: The problem of factory inspection in the concession has been subject to many negotiations with the municipal government due to twists and turns in the middle, and no solution has been found. Industrial safety is very important to both labor and management. The sanitation management equipment must be safe, and inspection is urgently needed. Therefore, industrial safety is closely related to the industry itself. Although the authorities have specific measures for this, it may be difficult to implement them for a while. Even the Taichang tragedy in the Zhengtai tragedy and the equipment that the Public Works Bureau considers satisfactory have had unprecedented incidents. The Machine-made National Goods Factory Federation of this city has specially initiated the automatic factory inspection and hired Hu Xi, Cheng Shouchong, Zhang Zhongjie, etc. as inspectors to take turns visiting the equipment of the member factories. The inspection is scheduled to be conducted once a week. The association had previously printed and distributed the automatic factory inspection method to its members to temporarily promote the soundness of the industry in order to make amends for the past. The inspection has been scheduled to start.</p>

<h3>New Guangdong Province Officials to Gather by the 10th: According to Mr. Liu Weichi</h3>
<p>Liu Weichi, the Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Industries, who has been transferred to the position of Director of the Construction Bureau of Guangdong Province, visited President Chiang at Lushan to receive instructions. After returning to Nanjing the day before yesterday, he took the 11 p.m. express train to Shanghai that evening. He arrived at the North Station around 7 a.m. yesterday and returned to his private residence on Guofu Men Road for rest. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency paid him a special visit. The following is what he said:</p>
<p>Gathering in Guangdong on Schedule</p>
<p>Mr. Liu first stated that all newly appointed Guangdong Province personnel must gather in Guangdong before the 10th of this month. He himself is scheduled to take the American postal ship "Grant" on the 5th. If time does not permit, he will postpone it to the 7th and take the French postal ship "Aramis" to Guangdong. Chairman Huang (Musong), Mayor Zeng (Yangfu), Director Xu (Chongqing), and Secretary-General Cen (Xuelu) are scheduled to come to Shanghai within the next few days. Wang Yingchang (Yingyu) is currently in Shaanxi and can also rush here by plane. All will be able to take a ship on the 5th or 7th. However, if some of them prefer to take a plane, they are free to do so. In any case, they must arrive in Guangzhou before the 10th.</p>
<p>Steps for Innovative Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Liu then answered the reporter's questions, saying that the innovative construction plan for Guangdong Province will be decided after inspecting the current situation in Guangdong. There is no specific plan yet, but it will consist of two steps. The first step is to reorganize the existing construction, because in the past three years, the construction in Guangdong Province may not have been entirely appropriate or fully completed, and reforms are needed everywhere. The second step is to expand and implement various new plans.</p>
<h3>Three Tung Oil Experts Return to Shanghai After Inspection, Share Impressions of Tung Oil in Hunan and Hubei; Mr. Zhang Jiazhu Consults in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the China Vegetable Oil Factory previously sent tung oil technical experts Lin Tianji, Wu Jinquan, and Liu Hu to Hunan and Hubei to investigate the general situation of the tung oil industry. They also visited Hankou, Changsha, and Changde. They returned to Shanghai on the 20th of last month. According to their written report, the following is an excerpt of their impressions:</p>
<p>Attitudes of Various Parties</p>
<p>(1) The governors of Hunan and Hubei provinces expressed great enthusiasm for the establishment of oil factories and provided detailed guidance and various conveniences. (2) Foreign oil refineries in Hankou were also willing to guide the tour and provide access for observation, which is greatly appreciated. (3) Foreign merchants suspect that the government will implement control over the establishment of tung oil refineries. (4) A small number of Chinese merchants, instigated by others, only care about immediate gains and do not understand the government's grand plan to improve tung oil, resulting in the same mentality as foreign merchants, and even instigating inland oil merchants, which is quite regrettable. (5) Inland oil merchants understand the overall situation, mostly support the factory's plan, and hope that the government will take effective measures against those who oppose it.</p>
<p>Trends in the Oil Industry</p>
<p>(1) In recent years, transportation has become more convenient, and the oil refining industry has gradually moved closer to the tung oil production areas, which can reduce transportation costs and taxes. Hankou is farther from the production areas, so many of the original oil refineries have been closed. (2) To improve oil quality and facilitate oil merchants, tung oil refining factories should be commonly established in tung producing areas, such as Chongqing, Changde, Yichang, Laohe, etc.</p>
<p>Improving Technology</p>
<p>(1) Hankou has always been a central market for tung oil. Currently, the oil refineries established by foreign merchants are limited to preliminary work, so the exported tung oil has not yet reached the level of refined and uniform quality, which needs to be improved urgently. (2) The traditional pressing method is inefficient and damages the oil quality, so it is necessary to switch to machine pressing. (3) The provinces of Hunan and Hubei have been promoting tung tree planting in recent years with great effort, but lack an overall plan and urgently need to adopt scientific methods to guide farmers to achieve practical results. The above points are just the main ones. It is said that the Preparatory Office has forwarded the details to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) Zhang Jiazhu, director of the Preparatory Office of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and tung oil technical expert Liu Hu recently went to Hangzhou to meet with Wu Tingyang, director of the Construction Bureau of Zhejiang Province, to discuss a plan for cooperation between tung farmers and oil merchants in Zhejiang. Director Wu is very enthusiastic about helping tung farmers and has confirmed plans to establish oil refineries in Hangzhou and Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Law Completed Drafting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The drafting committee for revising industrial and commercial laws and regulations, jointly formed by the Commercial Committee and the Industrial and Commercial Law Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held its first decision-making meeting on the 29th of the previous month, drafting 17 articles of the Guild Law, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday at 1 p.m., the committee held another meeting. Pan Yangyao, Lu Jiazi, Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, and Xu Yongzuo were present, chaired by Luo Qinghua. Ke Ganchen, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Zidong, Director of General Affairs, attended the discussion. By around 5 p.m., all seven chapters of the Chamber of Commerce Law had been revised. As soon as the draft implementation rules are ready, a joint meeting of the Commercial and Legal Committees will be convened to publicly discuss it. It is expected that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will submit it to the Ministry of Industry next week for adoption.</p>

<h3>US Far East Economic Expert Arrives in Shanghai, Mr. Su Hua to Arrive Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the Foreign Press Association, Mr. Su Hua, Foreign Trade Manager of the US California Chamber of Commerce in Oakland, an authoritative researcher on Far East economic issues, has been dispatched to Shanghai, which shows that trade groups in California are paying increasing attention. Mr. Su is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Tuesday (the 4th) aboard the Dollar Line's "President Grant" ship. It is reported that he will stay in Shanghai for a considerable period to meet with local business leaders to discuss everything. Mr. Su is also here as a representative of Oakland's manufacturers, who plan to find ways to expand their trade scope in the Far East. Mr. Su's trip to the Far East is expected to last three months and will focus on investigation and relationship building. Mr. Su will also be in contact with local representatives and trade association officials. According to Mr. Pennell, President of the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, Oakland's overseas trade will inevitably increase day by day. Mr. Su previously served as Director of the Overseas Trade Department at Armstrong University and later engaged in advanced research at Georgetown University. People in Shanghai are very willing to meet with him.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Director of Guangdong Navigation Administration, Yao Bolong, Arrives in Shanghai Today to Await Ship to Guangdong to Take Office</h3>
<p>After the Guangdong Incident was resolved, various facilities in Guangdong need to be reorganized urgently. Navigation administration in Guangdong is very important to transportation, so the Ministry of Communications has specially appointed Yao Bolong as the Director of the Guangdong Navigation Administration to oversee everything. Mr. Yao has served in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways for many years and has rich experience in navigation administration. He has now completed his instructions from Acting Minister Yu in Nanjing and is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Nanjing today to await a ship to Guangdong to take office.</p>
<h3>Japan Expands Banks in China: Taiwan and Korea Banks Seek to Control the Economy of Southern and Northern China</h3>
<p>In order to control the economy of North and South China, Japan has decided to expand the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan. The Bank of Korea is designated to be responsible for North China, adding branches in important places in North China. The Bank of Taiwan is responsible for South China, adding branches in important places in South China. Therefore, our country's banks attach great importance to the expansion of the above two banks. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has specially recorded the history of the two banks as follows: (1) The Bank of Korea was originally the Bank of Korea, established in 1909 with a special license from the Japanese government. In 1911, one year after Japan annexed Korea, the bank was reorganized and established as the Bank of Korea. The head office is located in Seoul, Korea. Branches in China include Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Andong, Dalian, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Xiaoxiguan, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, Lushun, Longjingcun, Fujia Dian, and Ge Yang, a total of 18 locations. The capital is 40 million Japanese yen, with 25 million Japanese yen already paid up. The public debt is more than 6 million Japanese yen. (2) The Bank of Taiwan was established in Taipei by Japan after the Sino-Japanese War and the Treaty of Shimonoseki, when Taiwan was ceded to Japan. It is a joint venture between the government and private merchants. It opened in 1899. The head office is located in Taipei. Branches in China include Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hankou, Shanghai, Shantou, Fuzhou, and Hong Kong, a total of seven locations. The capital is 15 million Japanese yen, and the public debt has reached more than 2.7 million Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Banking Circles in This City Plan to Establish Branches in Siam</h3>
<p>The results of the inspection tour to Siam by our country's inspection team have been compiled by Ling Bing, the head of the inspection team, into a detailed report to the Executive Yuan. It is learned that after the team returned to China and gave a detailed account of the situation in Siam, banking circles in this city learned that out of the 12 million people in Siam, most of them are Chinese compatriots. They are now planning to establish a bank in Siam, which will be led by the Bank of China to complete the mission. The second step of the plan is to open up shipping routes, which will be planned by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in conjunction with Chinese merchant shipping companies. Currently, only the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation and a few other companies such as the Italian Mail Steamer Company are doing business with Siam.</p>
<h3>Zhu Changnian to Report to Work Today, No Intention to Go to Lushan Recently</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Zhu Changnian, the newly appointed acting superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, officially took office the day before yesterday. Yesterday, because it was a weekly holiday, he went to the Shanghai Sanatorium around 10 a.m. to meet with Tang Shaoyi to discuss everything. He is scheduled to report to work at the Customs Superintendent's Office today. The report that Mr. Zhu will go to Lushan to visit Finance Minister Kong is denied by Mr. Zhu. The above rumor is absolutely inaccurate, because all the details have been telegraphed to Minister Kong for approval, so there is really no need to go there again.</p>
<h3>Jin Wensi Travels from Shanghai to Lushan to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>Jin Wensi, our country's minister to the Netherlands, has returned to China to report on his work. His vacation has expired, but because public and private affairs have not been completed, the date of his return to office has not yet been decided. It is now learned that Mr. Jin has traveled from Shanghai to Nanjing the day before yesterday and then to Lushan to pay respects to President Chiang for instructions. According to Mr. Jin's family, the date of the minister's return to office will be decided after the weather cools down in autumn.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Law Sends Chen Gemin to Guangdong, Scheduled to Depart by Ship on the 5th</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in view of the fact that the separated southwestern judiciary of the past has now been unified, and that rectification and reform are very important, has decided to send Councilor Chen Gemin to Guangdong to inspect, understand the actual situation, and lay the foundation for improvement. Mr. Chen will come to Shanghai from Nanjing within a few days and is scheduled to take the Dollar Company's "President Grant" ship on the 5th to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Czech Minister to China, Mr. Feigl, Went to Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Czech Minister to China and Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Feigl, left Shanghai yesterday morning with his wife and children on the Japanese ship "Nikkichi Maru" to Japan. It is reported that Mr. Feigl's trip is purely for summer vacation and has no other mission. He will return to Shanghai next month.</p>
<h3>Acting Consul Sugihara Returned Home Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Sugihara Arata, the former acting Japanese Consul General to Shanghai, was transferred back to his home province by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He left Shanghai with his family at 7:30 a.m. yesterday aboard the Japanese Mail's "Chichibu Maru" to return to his country. When he boarded the ship the night before, Japanese Consul General Wakasugi, Consul Terasaki, and Gan Nong, the head of the Japanese Resident Group, all went to the pier to see him off.</p>
<h3>Hongxing Sock Factory Fires Workers, Factory Refuses to Allow Them to Eat, Workers Request Party and Government Assistance Again</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee persuaded all the workers of the Hongxing Sock Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession to resume work first, a meeting was convened the day before yesterday to mediate the dispute between the two parties. Because the factory insisted on firing eight people and was willing to pay severance pay, but the workers believed that the factory's dismissal was unreasonable, the mediation failed. Yesterday, when the factory was serving meals, the dismissed workers Tu Jingqing, Ye Peiqing, Tang Caisheng, Zheng Yongli, and others entered the dining hall to eat. However, the factory manager, Li Mingqi, refused to allow the workers to enter the meal and notified the police station, which sent more than ten detectives and factory guards to escort the workers out of the factory, causing anger among all the workers and causing a disturbance. The labor union sent people to persuade them before things calmed down. Currently, the workers believe that since a dismissal relationship has not been established, the workers should continue to enter the factory for meals as usual. In response to the factory's unreasonable refusal, in addition to submitting a report to the Party and government agencies requesting negotiations, they will still enter the factory as usual, so the dispute may be difficult to resolve for a while. The issue of levying income tax.</p>
<p>Shen Liren Expresses His Views</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the date for our country to levy income tax has been postponed again to September 1 due to the arduous preparation procedures. Shen Liren, an accountant in this city, expressed his views on the collection of income tax, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Issues to Consider</p>
<p>The National Government included 5 million yuan for income tax in this year's budget. Although this number is not known on what basis it was obtained, given the large population and vast territory of our country, it is actually very small. However, this shows that our country is gradually moving towards the principle of equality in the taxation system, which is also gratifying. The date for the collection of income tax was originally set for July 1, but it has now been postponed again to the beginning of next month. The arduousness of the preparation work can be imagined. In the future, when collecting taxes, the procedures will be more troublesome than other taxes. Furthermore, the current collection of income tax is only for trial purposes. If the total revenue for this year is not enough to cover the expenses, will it be continued in the future? Considering the example of the United Kingdom, there have been cases where the cost of collecting taxes for the whole year exceeded the amount of income tax. This point should be considered by the preparatory authorities. It is said that there are 60 articles in the implementation rules for the new tax, but they have not been published. It is not known what their content is. As for the provisional regulations, the tax collection methods are divided into three categories: profit income, salary income, and interest income. The latter two are simpler in nature and easier to implement, so let's not discuss them for now. However, as far as profit-making businesses are concerned, there is much room for discussion. Gao Bingfang, Director of the Direct Tax Preparation Office, also expressed the same feeling. From the standpoint of a person engaged in accounting, I will present the issues that should be considered for the collection of income tax in our country at present.</p>
<p>Issue of Saving Expenses</p>
<p>(1) The issue of saving expenses. The opinion expressed by Finance Minister Kong in the newspapers the day before yesterday stated that the cost of collecting new taxes must be reduced as much as possible. However, according to Article 1 of the provisional regulations, the collection procedures for profit income must be divided into two steps. The first step is to calculate the percentage of income to the actual amount of capital. The second step is to multiply the prescribed tax rate by the amount of income to obtain the taxable amount. Therefore, the collection agency must also go through these two steps during the review. Taking Shanghai as an example, in the future, there will be hundreds of thousands of income tax report forms, so it will be necessary to hire many people to engage in this kind of review work, and expenses will not be saved. Moreover, from the surface, it seems quite fair to compare the actual amount of capital with the income to determine the amount of tax to be paid. In fact, those who run businesses should have a precise consideration of the amount of capital they need before they can determine it. The larger the capital, the more the income, and it is also very reasonable to levy taxes progressively. If the capital is large and the income is small, this is due to poor management, and the government does not need to specially reduce its tax rate. The payment of income tax requires filling out a report form. This kind of procedure is mostly done by the accountants of the taxpayer's business. The common format for the profit and loss statement in accounting is as follows: (A) Actual sales amount, (B) Subtract sales returns and discounts, cost of sales, (C) Gross profit, (D) Subtract various operating expenses, (E) Net profit. I believe that the classification of income tax report forms should be similar to the profit and loss statement, so that the accountants of each business can easily fill it out. The collection agency will save the labor of guidance and can easily review it, and expenses can be saved. The proposed format is as follows: (A) Total income, (B) Subtract tax-free portion, (C) Taxable income, (D) Subtract deductible expenses, (E) Taxable income. The classification of the above two tables is completely consistent. Taxable income is equivalent to gross profit, and taxable income is equivalent to net profit. Their meanings are very easy to understand and do not need to be explained.</p>
<p>Issue of Preventing Tax Evasion</p>
<p>(1) In addition to the issue of saving expenses mentioned above, how to prevent tax evasion is also very important. At this time when all industries are declining, with the implementation of the new tax, taxpayers are seeking ways to avoid or reduce taxes. If detailed regulations are not added, future tax revenue may be greatly impacted. Now, I will list the more important items in the following categories: (1) Actual capital amount. If the actual capital amount is to be used as a ratio with the income during collection, how the four words "actual capital amount" are to be explained is not specified in the provisional regulations. As far as we know, there are several types of actual capital amounts: original actual amount, net actual amount, and average amount. The calculation methods are different, and the ratio of income tax is also very different. Moreover, sole proprietorships and partnerships are more common than corporate organizations in our country, and their capital is not fixed and can be changed at any time, so that the ratio of income to capital is often less than 5%. In such a situation, what will the collection agency do? (2) Valuation of goods. Most countries adopt the principle of whichever is lower, cost or market price, for the valuation of goods. However, the market price of various goods is not uniform. Cunning people can reduce the valuation of their inventory, and the result will be less net profit, so they can avoid tax. Even if they have to pay, the amount will be small. Therefore, the implementation rules should stipulate that the valuation of inventory at the end of the period and the valuation of inventory at the beginning of the next period must adopt the same standard. Even if the taxpayer undervalues the inventory, resulting in less tax revenue, it can still be compensated for in the following year. (3) Tax-free portion. The interim regulations have stipulated some tax-free portions in Article 2, but attention should be paid to those who falsely set up various funds in order to evade taxes, such as labor compensation, old-age pensions, etc. The interest on these should also be added to the principal and managed by a committee organized by the workers themselves. (4) Deduction of operating expenses. According to Article 7, Paragraph 1, the income of the first category is taxed on the amount of net profit. Based on this, operating expenses must be deducted. However, how to deduct them is quite a problem. There are no provisions in the interim regulations for this point. Operating expenses can be divided into two categories according to their nature:</p>
<p>Types That Must Be Deducted</p>
<p>(A) Those that must be deducted: (1) Operating expenses whose amount can be determined: salaries, rent, advertising, water and electricity, and other fixed operating expenses. This type is easy to calculate and there are not many problems. (2) Operating expenses whose amount can be estimated: such as depreciation and bad debts. The level of their fixed rates is inversely proportional to the amount of net profit, so their impact is quite large. If the taxpayer arbitrarily sets the depreciation rate and bad debt rate high, the income from income tax will have to be reduced. The advanced countries in Europe and the United States that collect income tax have two methods to prevent this kind of tax evasion. One is to classify the depreciation rates of various assets and add detailed regulations, print them into a booklet, and issue them to taxpayers to follow. The other is to stipulate that once the depreciation rate and bad debt rate are determined, if the rate is reduced in the following year, the amount saved will be regarded as income and must still be taxed. On the contrary, it is regarded as a loss. For example, if the bad debt reserve for this year is set at 10%, totaling 1,000 yuan, and 500 yuan is recovered in bad debts in the decision year, this amount will be regarded as part of the income. After such regulations are made, disputes will be reduced. (3) Those whose amount is difficult to determine. In accounting, it is sometimes difficult to judge the difference between capital expenditures and expense expenditures. This kind of difficulty is also easy to encounter when preparing income tax reports. For example, machine repairs and partial replacements, etc., should they be deducted or not? The only solution is to treat them as expense expenditures and deduct them together with other operating expenses. If it is a capital expenditure, then in the United States and Europe, there are even detailed classifications of the repair and renewal expenses of various fixed assets, compiled into a booklet, so that auditors can use this to determine.</p>
<p>Types That May Be Deducted</p>
<p>(B) Those that may be deducted. Different countries have different regulations on whether or not to deduct this type of reward. For our country, we must examine the public sentiment, weigh the habits, and then make a decision. (1) Other direct taxes. Taxes can be divided into direct and indirect. However, it is not accurate to distinguish between the two. Generally, such as land tax, housing tax, income tax, inheritance tax, etc., are all direct taxes. So-called heavy taxes should refer to the same direct tax. The tax authorities should investigate whether there are any heavy taxes in the existing direct taxes. If there is a conflict with income tax, try to deduct it. (2) Insurance premiums. Fire insurance for houses should be one of the expenses. Life insurance is similar to savings and should not be deducted. However, the life insurance business in our country is still very immature. For the sake of promotion, it may be listed as a special deduction item. (3) Employee meals and lodging. In foreign countries, employees of ordinary businesses are generally not provided with meals and lodging. The situation in our country is slightly different. In the case of sole proprietorships and smaller-scale shops, employee meals and lodging are provided by the owners. In theory, only the employee's portion should be deducted. However, in fact, it is often mixed with the owner's meals and lodging expenses, and it is difficult to distinguish. Whether meals and lodging should be provided must also be stipulated. (4) Donations. Foreign countries generally exempt donations from tax. Wealthy people with large incomes are happy to donate. The United States has recently added a charity tax to direct taxes, so it is to prevent this kind of tax evasion. According to the situation in our country, whether to deduct it and how to prevent fake donations to evade taxes must also be considered. (5) Children's education expenses. Although Article 2, Category 3 of the provisional regulations stipulates that the interest on educational savings that does not reach 100 yuan per year is tax-free, should the expenditure on children's education also be deducted? In theory, the tax rate should be inversely proportional to the parents' income. Furthermore, for parents who are old and rely on their children for a living, a portion of their children's income should also be exempt from taxation.</p>
<h3>District Offices Should Correspond with Organizations Using Official Letters</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, saying, "We have recently received letters and telegrams from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Henan Sheqi Cymbal Chamber of Commerce, the Hubei Ouchikou Chamber of Commerce, the Anhui Huoshan County Chamber of Commerce, the Hubei Pengyi Market Chamber of Commerce, the Jiangxi Leping County Chamber of Commerce, the Fujian Shangyang Town Chamber of Commerce in Yugan County, the Fuqing County Chamber of Commerce, and the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, etc., requesting to forward the request to withdraw the order of the district office to use orders for documents to agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations. The district office and local industrial and commercial organizations are both people's autonomous organs. In the past, the use of official letters did not hinder the promotion of autonomy. If the district office must use orders, the good district head may not have any abuses, but the unscrupulous ones will inevitably abuse their authority over the local people, which may adversely affect the future of autonomous work. We hereby send this letter to your association, asking you to investigate and argue according to reason, and to withdraw the order of the district office to use orders for documents to industrial and commercial organizations, so as to value legal entities and prevent abuses, etc. Therefore, we hereby telegraph to your government and ministries for review and verification, and sincerely request that the order of the district office to use orders for documents to agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations be withdrawn. In the future, official letters will be used for correspondence to prevent abuses. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Chairman Lin Kanghou.</p>

<h3>Heavy Rain Again in Shanghai Yesterday; Hot Weather Like Late Autumn; Watermelon Market Prices Plunge for Days</h3>
<p>Since the heavy thunderstorm in Shanghai on the 31st of last month, the weather has not cleared up, and it has been overcast all day, with extremely unstable climate. Yesterday, there were showers in both the morning and afternoon, and the rain became heavier after 4:00 PM and did not stop in the evening. Although the time is in the hot season, the weather is cool, like late autumn, which can be described as abnormal. It is reported that the watermelon market in the local goods industry has fallen from more than five yuan to about three yuan per batch (300 jin) in the past three days, and few people are interested. The cold drink shops are deserted, truly empty enough for sparrows to be caught.</p>
<h3>Narcotics Seized in Brothel; Proprietor Sentenced to Two Years</h3>
<p>At No. 44 Xiaohuayuan Road, Zhejiang Road, someone secretly organized a human meat market (commonly known as a "salted meat shop") and provided opium smoking equipment. Customers with smoking habits could also buy and smoke opium at a considerable price. This was discovered by Western Detective Fang Te of the Flower Tax Squad of the Old Gate Police Station, who led Chinese Detective Zhang Jizhi of No. 1013 Hua Sandao to search the premises a few days ago. At that time, there were no prostitutes or customers, but two opium pipes, two containers of opium paste, one opium lamp, six ounces of red pills, thirty-one packages of raw opium, three containers of opium ash, and other smoking paraphernalia were seized. The proprietor, Shen Shousheng from Suzhou, was arrested and sent to the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, a clerk from the police station, prosecuted him in accordance with Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Regulations. Shen also confessed that the opium was exclusively for customers to smoke when they came to the shop. After questioning by Judge Feng, the sentence was announced: Shen was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and the seized smoking paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>

Yesterday morning, another batch arrived at the South Shanghai market, and its quality is still good. It is predicted that a large batch will arrive in the coming days, and prices will have to be suppressed. As for the market prices of common rice, Ke Xian rice, and Yin Yuan rice (glutinous rice), they are all tight due to the rainy weather, with price increases of more than a few cents.</p>

<h3>New Labor Service Corps of the New Life Movement; Armbands Should Be Uniform</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city issued a special order to various groups to comply with the following in order to standardize the armbands of the New Life Labor Service Corps: "For compliance, according to the letter from the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, it has been found that the New Life Labor Service Corps organized by various agencies, groups, and schools in this city have been established one after another and will soon begin to provide external services. However, the armband is an item that urgently needs to be prepared. In order to achieve uniformity, all armbands that do not meet the regulations of the General Association are not allowed to be worn. Therefore, the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales General Bureau has been commissioned to produce a large number of armbands according to the style issued by the General Association, which have been printed. The cloth is made of high-quality domestic goods and printed with non-fading paint. After being reviewed and qualified by this association, they are allowed to be issued. The price of each armband only recovers the cost of six cents. In addition to reporting to the General Association to inform all provinces, counties, and cities across the country to adopt them uniformly, we also request your department to instruct your subordinates to obtain the required number and price directly from this association in order to achieve standardization and facilitate promotion, etc." Based on this approval, in addition to issuing instructions, the association is ordered to comply and purchase the required number of armbands at the prepared price directly from the New Life Movement Promotion Association, and to instruct its subordinates to comply with it as necessary. This order.</p>
<h3>A Traveler Takes Poison in the Great China Hotel</h3>
<p>In the Great China Hotel, No. 605 Xizang Road, Public Concession, a traveler surnamed Zhang, nearly thirty years old, for some unknown reason, swallowed tranquilizer pills to commit suicide at 1:00 PM yesterday. Before long, the poison took effect and was beyond remedy. The waiter discovered this and summoned an ambulance to rush to the Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took too much poison and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Four More People Sue the Mei Hua Bank, Suing Gu Yubo and Others for Not Honoring Checks; The Court Must Investigate Before Further Hearings</h3>
<p>After the Mei Hua Bank at No. 230 Jiujiang Road closed, lawsuits have arisen one after another. Now, Xiao Yuliang, Shen Enzhen, Luo Xiangsheng, Sun Chaoyong, and others have hired Lawyer Lin Zaoqing to file a complaint in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Gu Yubo, shareholder and manager; Zhang Xusheng, shareholder and deputy manager; Chen Yizai, shareholder; Bao Ziwen and Li Yijin, shareholder and director of affairs; and Wu Qinglei, shareholder and business director, for not honoring checks, and request a declaration of provisional execution. Xiao holds a Mei Hua bank check dated May 7 of this year, amounting to 7,000 yuan in national currency, while Shen, Luo, Sun, and others also each hold the bank's checks, amounting to 5,200 yuan in national currency, totaling 12,200 yuan in national currency. When they went to collect the money when they became due, they were not cashed. Although they have repeatedly reported it, they were ignored. The bank is registered in Hong Kong and has not registered with the National Government in accordance with the Banking Law, so it cannot be regarded as a legal person. Therefore, the shareholders are actually partners and should be jointly responsible for repaying all debts. Therefore, it is requested that they be ordered to jointly and severally repay 12,200 yuan, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum until the date of repayment, and a declaration of provisional execution. Yesterday, the First Special Court held a hearing. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the complaint, Qian Zheng, the clerk representing Zhang Xusheng, immediately stated that Zhang was not a shareholder of Mei Hua and that the plaintiff should provide conclusive proof. According to banking practice, checks cannot exceed a ten-day time limit, but the checks presented by the plaintiffs have a term of up to nineteen days. Moreover, there are multiple checks, all of which were issued when the bank collapsed, and the checks were issued in the name of Deng Gu Yubo, which is suspicious. The reason why the plaintiffs obtained the checks has not been explained. Therefore, it is requested that the plaintiffs be summoned to court to explain. The court verified the report and ordered a postponement for further hearings after investigation.</p>
<h3>Chen Huizhang Case Support Association; Invited People from All Walks of Life Yesterday; Chen's Father Wept and Knelt Down, Begging</h3>
<p>The Chen Huizhang Case Support Association, for the brutal murder of Chen Huizhang by British sailors, invited people from all walks of life yesterday. The rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association and the rickshaw pullers' association also hosted a large petition at the same time. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Support Association invited people from all walks of life at the Jianghuai Fellow Association. Yang Chungkui of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Xing Hua of the Fish Market, Sun Choucheng of the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Sun Zhaokang of the Yancheng Fellow Association, Zhang Wencai of the Lianshui Fellow Association, and Gu Jun, and others, totaling more than 400 people, with Su Chunlian, Zhang Shiying, Xu Yong, Wei Weiqing, and Li Longtu as the presidium. Zhou Weigao and others were sent by the Rickshaw Pullers Association, and Cang Gongwen, Xu Zhulin, He Wushan, Zhu Fengxiang, and other directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, and more than a hundred rickshaw pullers went to petition.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Su Chunlian reported, "We are very honored to have you here today for the reception of our association to people from all walks of life. As for the cause of this matter, it was very small, but the result was very serious. When this happened, three sailors were detained by the police station, but they were released without following the procedures. This is one point of disagreement. Also, because of the release of the three perpetrators, the identification of witnesses was resumed, turning the active criminals into suspects. Because they could not be identified, criminal charges could not be established, and civil charges were even more difficult to establish. However, the warship was willing to pay for the consolation, which is obviously contradictory. There are two ways to deal with this matter: (1) Punish the murderers in accordance with the criminal law for the public good; (2) Request consolation for the private good. However, this matter is of great importance, and it relies on everyone's wisdom and efforts to make a fair and just protest in order to achieve results. Therefore, I hope that all sectors of society will jointly support us."</p>
<p>Report on the Process</p>
<p>It was decided that Zhang Shiying would report on the process, advocating one: punish the murderers; two: consolation; three: apology; four: guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. This matter is not just a matter for one person or one village, but a shame to the Chinese nation. Just like the case of Nakayama Hideo Hyosho, the Japanese attached so much importance to it, but Chen Huizhang also belongs to mankind, but he is ignored. Also, when the traitors in Tianjin were killed, the Japanese government demanded 30,000 yuan from us for consolation and 1,000 yuan for funeral expenses, but the Chen Huizhang case only offered 500 yuan. Why is the former valuable and the latter cheap? The organization of the Support Association is to fight for the entire nation," and so on. It was decided that Xu Yong, Li Longtu, Wei Weiqing, and others would give speeches, the main points of which were: (1) To persevere to the end and expand the organization; (2) To ask the authorities to observe the trial; (3) To comfort the family members and not be lured by money; (4) To recover consular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Successive Speeches</p>
<p>It was decided that Gu Jun would speak briefly, saying, "I hope that your association's four goals will be resolved as soon as possible. If we do not achieve our goals, we will protest against imperialism. Do not forget that this is a means of imperialist oppression. The death of Chen Huizhang is a little blood of the Chinese nation." Yang Chungkui said, "I hope that we will not show weakness and jointly devise practical countermeasures to serve as a warning." Sun Choucheng said in his speech, "The death of Chen Huizhang is as light as a feather, while the deaths of Nakayama Hideo Hyosho and the traitors in Tianjin are as heavy as Mount Tai. You should know that the Chen Huizhang case is not a matter for the Jianghuai Fellow Association, but a matter for the Republic of China. Human beings should be equal, and we cannot ignore him just because he is a rickshaw puller and not an official." Finally, Sun Bawu and others spoke, with long speeches.</p>
<p>Chen's Father Wept After the meeting, Chen Huizhang's father wept to the crowd about the process and his family situation, and knelt down and wailed. At that time, Zhou Weigao, the representative of the Rickshaw Pullers Association, and Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, Xu Zhulin, Zhu Fengxiang, and Lu Deguang, and more than a hundred others, held flags and petitioned the assembly, demanding (1) Punish the murderers; (2) Consolation; (3) Apology. The presidium received them separately and agreed to submit them to the council for discussion. The original petition is recorded as follows: "We are presenting this petition for the case of the brutal assault of rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang by British sailors, appealing for the upholding of justice in order to protect national sovereignty and respect the lives of the people. Although we representatives are coolies, we are also citizens. Rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang is also a member of the Republic of China. Now he has been innocently brutally beaten to death by foreign sailors. Such an act of overwhelming the host is not only contemptuous of the lives of the people, but also insults our national sovereignty. All compatriots cannot remain silent. We representatives feel especially concerned, since we are all subject to the same fate. At 3:00 PM on July 27th, we held an emergency meeting of rickshaw pullers at the West District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, and decided on (1) punishing the murderers; (2) apologizing; (3) consolation; (4) guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again, and other matters, and designated Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, Zhu Fengxiang, and Xu Zhulin as representatives to send letters of support. Recently, we have learned that August 2nd is the date for your association to host a meeting with people from all walks of life to report the truth. We representatives are filled with grief and emotion. In addition to sending representatives to attend the meeting, we have also gathered our colleagues to petition the meeting, begging your association to uphold justice, argue on the basis of reason, and not stop until the goals of punishing the murderers, apologizing, consolation, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again are achieved, in order to protect national sovereignty and respect the lives of the people. The compatriots are fortunate, and the country is fortunate."</p>

<h3>Laundry Collapses on Donghengbin Road; Eight Workers Injured</h3>
<p>Inside the Yu Bingji Laundry at No. 2 Peideli, Donghengbin Road, Zhabei, at about 12:00 PM yesterday, the laundry workers were having lunch together in the pavilion upstairs when the house, due to years of disrepair and corrosion, and because the floorboards could not bear the weight, suddenly broke. The entire floor of the pavilion collapsed, and the walls on all sides also collapsed one after another due to the vibration. As a result, none of the workers in the pavilion escaped and all fell down, and all were injured by bricks, stones, and wooden beams. When the collapse occurred, the sound was like a huge thunder, shocking the neighbors.

<h3>Silk Industry Bank Adjusts Business Strategy; Jiaxing Branch Opens This Month; Notice of Closing Four Branches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, with the assistance of Jiangsu Bank, especially with the support of the Bank of Communications, and the subsequent appointment of the new General Manager Lu Zidong and Deputy General Manager Lu Longzhi, has greatly increased its reputation and rapidly advanced its business, showing a vigorous atmosphere. The bank, in view of the lack of financial institutions in Jiaxing since the decline of the Qian industry, is preparing to establish a branch there to adjust the surplus and deficit. The Tangwan Street has been surveyed as the location of the bank, and the house decoration is in progress. It is heard that the official opening is scheduled for this month. Other places, such as Huzhou, are also important silk towns. In the past two years, the silk industry has seen good development, but the local liquidity of funds has not been fully developed. The silk industry has asked the bank to establish a branch in Huzhou, and it is heard that it is also in preparation. It is also known that the bank held an important business meeting on August 1 to decide on a new adjustment policy for future business. In view of the changes of the times, all the branches established in the city and abroad in the past need to be re-allocated. Therefore, it was decided to close the East Xihuade Road Hongkou Branch, the Kader Road West District Branch, the Kaizier Road Baxianqiao Branch in this city, and the Nanjing Branch in other cities, starting from August 3. At the same time, they were closed and announced in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai respectively. All the staff of the branches have been transferred properly. That evening, the colleagues of the General Branch of the Bank in this city held a grand dinner party on the roof of the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road to celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of the Bank on July 6. All employees, from Chairman Wang, General Manager Lu, and Deputy General Manager Lu, participated, creating a grand scene for a time.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Buddhist Association Will Revise Its Constitution Again; The Standing Committee Notified Yesterday; The Supervisors Express Their Opinions</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association in this city sent a letter to all directors and supervisors yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, since the establishment of the association in the Republic of China in 1929, it has been six sessions until the summer of 1935. Because of being busy protecting the Buddhist property, the association has not been able to promote other important matters. The Buddhist associations in various provinces often did not report to this association when handling association affairs, and even the organization of Buddhist associations in cities and counties did not report for record. The membership fees that should be paid are mostly recognized but not paid, or not paid in full, resulting in an abnormal gap between the three-level Buddhist associations. The Buddhist associations in various provinces have failed to support the National Assembly at the top and failed to lead the cities and counties at the bottom. The handling of association affairs has not followed the right track, which is undeniable. Therefore, at the Seventh National Congress, in accordance with the central guidance for improvement, all guest Buddhist associations were abolished, and the city and county associations were used as branch associations, directly guided by this association, and the constitution was revised and submitted to the central party and government agencies for approval and record. Since the revision of the constitution at last year's congress, this association has been organizing and registering branch associations in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Entering Through the Front Door and Exiting Through the Back Door; Scamming Leather Slippers; More Than 500 Pairs in Total</h3>
<p>Huang Kuanmin from Zhenjiang, 26 years old, runs the Guangda Shoe Factory at No. 1140 Xinmin Road, Zhabei. A street runner named Xie Wenrong, accompanied by a guest named Zhang Zue, was introduced to the factory by an introducer named Li Adong a few days ago to purchase 500 pairs of leather slippers, priced at 250 yuan. Huang then sent an old clerk to follow the customer's car to unload the goods at No. 11 Tong'anli, Yong'an Street. Zhang then instructed the clerk to go to the Overseas Chinese Bathhouse to collect the money. The guest, Zhang Zue, entered through the front door, turned around and escaped through the back door without a trace. Xie waited for a long time and did not see him, so he rushed to No. 11 Tong'anli to pick up the goods, only to find that Zhang had already moved the goods, resulting in the loss of both money and goods. Later, he met the original introducer, Li Adong, on Minguo Road, and when questioned, Li denied the introduction. He immediately called the police Wu Jinyou to arrest him and take him to the Yemiao Police Station for investigation. After questioning by Inspector Chen, he found that the case belonged to a new type of scam involving property. He ordered the case to be sent to the General Bureau for investigation. Since the cancellation of the provincial council, some people have raised objections, causing disputes and affecting the progress of the association's affairs. Otherwise, it could be promoted smoothly and its effectiveness could be seen. In order to avoid various misunderstandings, this association has adopted the draft constitution of the suggester and distributed it to all colleagues for preliminary research. The matter is deeply and greatly related to the interests of Buddhism. We hope that you will seriously review, study, and refer to it, and send your opinions to the association before August 15th of the lunar calendar, so that they can be submitted to the fourth meeting of directors and supervisors for discussion before being submitted to the congress for discussion. This association will always use the majority opinion for voting in order to promote public interest and benefit the Buddhist community. This is what we pray for. Boy Sun Jinyu, 11 years old, local accent, wearing a yellow vest, striped cloth shorts, bald head, barefoot, got lost near Bansongyuan Road, South Railway Station at 3:00 PM yesterday. The police station in charge found him. It is said that his parents are in the countryside and do not want him anymore. Therefore, a document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for relief.</p>

<h3>Murder of a Seven-Year-Old Boy: Confession of the Criminal Obtained; Corpse Sent to Zhenru for Forensic Examination</h3>
<p>Wang Zhanian, a 28-year-old man from Taizhou residing in a thatched shed along the road, more than a hundred paces north of Zhongshan Road on Hutai Road, Zhabei, worked as a refueling assistant at the North Railway Station. His elder brother, Changnian, lived with him. On the morning of the 25th of last month, Zhanian's eldest son, Yu Hong, only seven years old, disappeared while playing outside the house. The family searched without success and learned that he had been lured away by a neighboring boy named Gui Changyu. They immediately reported Gui to the Tanziawan Police Station under whose jurisdiction they fell, who transferred him to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, and then forwarded him to the Public Security Bureau. He was then escorted to the Shanghai District Court. The investigating judge ordered the plaintiff, Wang Zhanian, to bring Gui Changyu out and instructed him to find the child. Unexpectedly, around 4 PM on the 29th, a child's corpse was suddenly discovered in the Bai Pi Qiao River within the jurisdiction of the Pengpu Town Police Station.</p>
<p>The body was promptly retrieved and placed on the bank. The police station reported this to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which notified the deceased child's father, Wang Zhanian, to identify the body. He confirmed it was indeed his son, Wang Yuhong, based on two small braids, a pair of small cloth pants, and a trouser belt. In addition to reporting to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy, the plaintiff reported the</p>
<p>circumstances of the crime</p>
<p>to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. The Sub-bureau Chief secretly dispatched a detective squad, who successively apprehended five suspects. The statements of the defendant(s) are recorded as follows: The plaintiff, Wang Zhanian, stated that he lived in a self-built thatched shed in Guanyintang, Hutai Road. The shed consisted of nine rooms, which he shared with his elder brother, Changnian, who worked at a gas company for a living. Wang Changnian testified that</p>
<p>after the incident occurred,</p>
<p>Lu A'gen and Zhou Bingrong, who ran a small shop in the area, invited him to an empty house to discuss the matter, saying that Yang Jinbao, who was on the run, could find the child, but demanded a reward of 200 yuan, which was not paid. He did not expect that his nephew had already been murdered. The rest of his statement was similar to the above. The defendant, Zhou Bingrong, testified that he was 28 years old, from Funing, and lived on Hutai Road, working as a cart pusher. He initially denied everything but later admitted that he and the fugitive "Oldest" Yang Jinbao had a grudge against Wang Zhanian, and they planned to</p>
<p>lure the child out</p>
<p>and extort 200 yuan from him. However, they couldn't get the money and were reported to the police, so they killed the child and threw the body in the river wrapped in a reed mat.

Fan Dapeng testified that he was 37 years old, from Funing, lived in a thatched shed on Hutai Road, and made a small living, as well as</p>
<p>being arrested for opium use.</p>
<p>Tan A'gen testified that he was 37 years old, from Shanghai, lived at 36 Guanyintang, and denied killing the child. He only admitted to knowing Fan and the others and admitted to smoking opium. Another person, named Mao A'wu, 34 years old, a local, lived at No. 10 Hutai Road and made a living by farming. He was</p>
<p>arrested along with the others</p>

<h3>Miss Liu Chunpu's Daughter's Wedding</h3>

<h3>Qingliang Temple Property Dispute: Partial Execution of Old Buildings Today; Valuation and Purchase of the Entire Property Underway</h3>
<p>The property dispute involving Qingliang Temple and the mortgagee, Sheng Yulin's Tonghe Foreign Firm, has been in litigation for several years. The court ruled in favor of execution, but public opinion opposed the mortgaging and sale of religious relics in order to preserve the temple property. Therefore, local people organized a support association and initiated administrative remedies, leading to delays until now. Last week, the court reopened the debate and advised both parties to reconcile, but to no avail. Therefore, it was decided that at 9 AM today, the execution of several old buildings next to the temple, a dozen or so rooms, will be allowed first. As for the relocation of the rest, a grace period will be granted to find a way to negotiate. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired with Qinghai, the abbot of the temple, who said that the temple is a local public property and a religious building. Because Tonghe has not been sincere in negotiations, it has been impossible to resolve the matter. As for the more than ten old houses that were executed today, the temple had already renovated them at a cost of millions. If Tonghe repays this cost, it will be difficult to dispose of this property. The Maintenance Committee's intention is to purchase the entire temple property from Tonghe at the price stipulated by the Public Works Department, which may be a solution. This is currently underway, but the outcome depends entirely on whether Tonghe is sincere in resolving the dispute. Therefore, although it is called execution now, it actually cannot resolve this dispute.</p>
<h3>Robbers Identified by Accomplices</h3>
<p>Pan Hongyu's cigarette and paper shop at No. 37 Kunming Road was closed and locked at 10:45 PM on October 19, 1933. Unexpectedly, five robbers armed with weapons broke in and tried to rob the shop. Unable to open the iron gate, the shop assistants sounded the alarm, and the robbers fled in different directions. Subsequently, the Hongkou Police apprehended four robbers involved in the case: Han Songlin, Tao Jingen, Tang Jiquan, and Liu Heshang, and sent them to the First Special Court. After interrogation, they were sentenced to prison and are currently serving their sentences. The accomplice who supplied the guns for the case, a Ningbo native named Lu Gencai, remained at large. Until last winter, he was arrested for another robbery and sentenced to eight years in prison. Recently, Cui Chengke, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, learned of this and went to the prison to have the four robbers, Han, etc., identify him as their accomplice. He was brought back to the police station the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, described the incident and presented evidence from the convicted robbers Han, Tao, Tang, and Liu, proving that Lu initiated the plan, provided the money to buy the guns, and went to rob the shop. When questioned, Lu made evasive statements. Judge Xiao sentenced Lu Gencai to three years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Private Prosecution Cases Still Received Directly by the Court; However, the Reasons for New Cases Should Be Simultaneously Sent to the Prosecutor to Prevent Abuses Such as Filing Both a Private Prosecution and a Public Indictment</h3>
<p>The President and Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court recently received instructions from the Jiangsu High Court, stating that: "The Department of Judicial Administration's Order No. 3360 was received. The Chief Prosecutor of the Hunan High Court reported, 'The private prosecution system was originally intended to reduce complexity and improve litigation. Since its implementation, private prosecution documents have been directly received by the court. There is no communication between the court and the prosecutor. Cases have occurred where private prosecutions are filed before the prosecutor concludes the investigation of a public indictment, or private prosecutions are filed after disposition, or public indictments are filed while private prosecutions are underway, or even the same case involves both private and public indictments. Because the court and the prosecutor have separate jurisdictions, and the facts often differ, they handle cases separately, leading to confusion. It is only after the fact that the issues are discovered and corrected, resulting in repeated delays and litigation burdens. This not only harms the people but also undermines the dignity of the law. I have repeatedly considered this and respectfully request that your department issue an order to all courts that, in the future, private prosecution cases be received and transferred by the prosecutor, so that the provisions of Articles 315 and 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law can be easily implemented, and the above-mentioned abuses will not arise. All information regarding the implementation of the private prosecution system and its remedial measures are hereby submitted for your review and implementation.' According to this, it is true that failing to communicate between the two parties in private prosecution cases makes it difficult to avoid the various abuses mentioned in the original report. However, if all private prosecution documents are received and transferred by the prosecutor, it would not only increase the burden, but also make it easier to confuse private and public indictments. The court should continue to receive them directly, but whenever there is a new case, the reasons for the case should be sent to the court's prosecutor for review to remedy situations where a private prosecution is filed before a public indictment is concluded, or a private prosecution is filed after a public indictment is disposed of, or both a private prosecution and a public indictment are filed simultaneously, or a case involves both private and public indictments. Please comply with this order and instruct your subordinates to do the same." Upon receiving this order, the President and Chief Prosecutor of the court are to be instructed to comply. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Land Measurement Begins in Luhang and Gaohang</h3>

The Bureau is now beginning to measure the land in Blocks 8, 17, and 18 of Section 22 of Luhang District, and Blocks 52 and 53 of Section 22 of Gaohang District. Landowners should pay attention to the following items: (1) The land chief will distribute reporting forms to landowners. Landowners should fill them out truthfully within ten days of receiving the forms and have the land chief collect them and deliver them to Surveying Team No. 1 at No. 26 Zhangjiaqiao Town East Road, Luhang District, or landowners can deliver them to the surveying team themselves. (2) If landowners do not receive the reporting forms because their addresses are unknown, they can fill out the forms themselves at the Bureau or Surveying Team No. 1. (3) If landowners cannot fill out the field list name and acreage because the field lists are mortgaged, they should immediately copy them from the pawnbroker and not refuse. (4) When the land is measured, landowners must, together with the land chief, clearly point out the boundaries to the surveyors.</p>
<p>Or pre-authorize a representative to identify the boundaries. Otherwise, the Bureau will only rely on the land chief's instructions, and landowners will be responsible for any errors that occur in the future. The above four items are related to landowners' consolidation of property rights. In addition to instructing the land chiefs in each block to comply, it is necessary to issue a public notice so that landowners pay special attention. This notice, also serving as the director, Xu Fu.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Recent Trend of Prices and Their Future</h3>
<p>— Zixiao</p>
<p>Since 1931, China's prices have fallen rapidly; among the ups and downs of various prices, there is a regular development, that is, the decline in export prices is faster than wholesale prices, and the decline in wholesale prices is faster than import prices. Therefore, the difference between the three gradually increases, forming a regular sequence. If the indices of the three types of prices are plotted on a line graph, the sequence is clearly displayed on the graph. Although the trends of the three are similar, there is a great difference in degree. This difference shows the extremely unfortunate fate of the Chinese economy. Under the double pressure of overseas devaluation and rising silver prices, in order to maintain its only point of export in the international market, China had to try its best to suppress export prices so that the sales price of export commodities abroad could be in harmony with international prices. In this way, the export prices had to be suppressed lower and lower, and the terms of trade—the rate of barter—became more and more unfavorable. Farmers used to be able to exchange ten catties of fertilizer with one and a half days of labor, but in the summer of 1935, they had to spend two and a half days of labor to exchange the same amount of fertilizer. This is the so-called exploitative terms of trade. Since the currency reform in November of last year, the situation has been completely reversed. We abandoned the old silver standard, and the exchange rate suddenly dropped by more than 40% in the night of November 3rd to 4th and was stabilized. Prices were no longer dominated by the rising exchange rate but were turned to be affected by the sudden decline in the exchange rate. As a result, all kinds of prices tended to rise together. The depressed national economy, on the road of traveling in the underworld, received extraordinary stimulation, and there was a temporary appearance of excitement. The return of the national economy from adversity seemed foreseeable. However, the rise in prices and its trend since August have two facts that are generally noticed. First, the most severe rise in various prices was only in the one or two months after the currency reform, namely November and December of last year. In the following months, the rising trend was weakened, showing signs of stagnation. Second, the degree of rise in various prices was quite different from each other. At the beginning of the currency reform, the highest increase was in import prices, followed by export prices, and then wholesale prices and the cost of living index. The trend in the following months was quite different. Export prices continued to rise, while import prices, after a period of exuberance, felt hesitant and showed signs of retreating. If the three types of prices mentioned above are plotted on a graph, the trend is not as regular as before the currency reform. Wholesale prices and export prices rise together, while import prices show a slight decline, with no stable relationship. The following are the indices and situations of export, import, and wholesale prices:</p>
<p>Although the degree of increase in export prices and wholesale prices at the beginning of the currency reform was not as high as that of import prices, they later showed a trend of gradual increase. Although the rise in import prices was more rapid at the beginning of the currency reform, they later showed signs of stagnation. The explanation for this phenomenon is quite noteworthy. A group of blind scholars believe that although prices had a sudden rise during the currency reform last year, they later showed signs of stagnation and did not continue to soar. Therefore, they frequently issued pessimistic arguments. This is superficial talk and need not be discussed. They only know that China's exchange rate has been devalued, but they forget that China's exchange rate was immediately stabilized after being devalued by 40% in one day and night. They did not consider whether a sudden price surge is needed under a stable exchange rate. The views of another group of people are more progressive. They believe that after the currency reform, export prices rose the fastest and maintained a continuous upward trend, import prices were more stable than export prices, and wholesale prices and the cost of living index were more stable than import prices. Therefore, they put forward optimistic opinions, saying that China's terms of trade—the rate of price exchange—will become more and more favorable, and people can exchange the same amount of foreign goods with less labor. The exploitative exchange rate will no longer be a disaster for China's economy. Secondly, farmers, who are producers of raw materials, will see their economic situation gradually improve under the circumstances of rising export prices and favorable terms of trade, and their benefits will be greater than those of other classes. The income of the largest majority of people in the country will increase more than before, and the prosperity of the national economy is even more promising. Therefore, they seem to hope that export prices will continue to be in the leading position of rising, because this is the way to increase the income of raw material producers and make the terms of trade more favorable. Although this view is more insightful than the previous one, it is still open to discussion. Below, we will try to analyze our opinions on the current situation of price trends.</p>
<p>First, under a stable exchange rate, there is absolutely no need for a drastic change in prices. This reason is very simple, and everyone with common banking and monetary knowledge understands it. Since the exchange rate is stable, if prices rise too quickly, or even without a certain limit, it will be difficult to export goods, the balance of international payments will be affected, and the stable exchange rate will be subject to reverse adjustment, and even collapse because it cannot maintain its stability. The theory is like this, and recent international events can be cited as evidence. The most important point of the strength of the pound is that domestic prices can be maintained stable. We assume that if domestic prices in the United Kingdom suddenly rise by 10% or 20% in the short term, we dare to assert that the British government and the public will not be happy about it, but will suddenly feel the difficulty of maintaining the pound price. The most important point of the recent repeated crises of the franc is not the decline in prices, but that under the circumstances that the French government is trying to tighten up in order to make export prices in line with international prices, suddenly prices rise in the opposite direction, making France's international payments even more trapped in a desperate situation. We assume that if domestic prices in France rise by another 10% or 20% in the short term, the price of the franc will inevitably collapse, and the situation will be as clear as watching fire. The recent events in these two countries can be used as our reference. The stability of prices is a prerequisite for the stability of the exchange rate, and the situation in our country is the same. Although our country's exchange rate has been devalued by 40%, it is now kept fixed and not allowed to fluctuate slightly. If domestic prices suddenly rise by 50%, it will be more difficult to export goods than before the reform, and it will be easier to import foreign goods than before the reform. Its advantages and disadvantages to our country's economy are self-evident. Therefore, we are not worried about the fact that prices have not changed drastically in the past few months, and we secretly congratulate ourselves, thinking that this is the best phenomenon. I hope that the people of the country will not be deceived by fallacies, thinking that with a little effort, prices can rise to the sky. If prices rise too quickly, not only will the exchange rate be affected by reverse adjustment, but also domestic credit will expand, the distribution of benefits will be uneven, and a phenomenon of profit inflation (Loflation of profits) will be created, which will not only not help the national economy, but also sow the seeds of new panic. In the future, we only hope that prices can rise slowly in stability, which will be the most beneficial contribution to laying the foundation for national currency credit and adjusting the domestic economic structure. A galloping price change is not only not welcomed by us, but should also be avoided with all our efforts.</p>
<p>Second, there is also a certain limit to the degree to which export prices rise faster than import prices, which is beneficial to the national economy, and this situation cannot be allowed to develop indefinitely. Before the currency reform, export prices fell the fastest, making our terms of trade in international trade increasingly unfavorable, which was generally recognized as an exploitative mode of trade. Since the currency reform, although the changes in export prices in the first one or two months were not as fast as those of import prices, in the following months, import prices showed signs of stagnation, while export prices showed a trend of gradual rise. This development, as the optimistic interpretation suggests, our terms of trade are gradually turning to be favorable. The income of raw material producers has the possibility of increasing proportionally. However, we believe that this issue should be viewed from another aspect. If import prices remain relatively stable, and other domestic prices gradually rise, as shown by the domestic situation in the past few months, then there is a big question whether it is possible to increase imports. Assuming that there are no major changes in foreign prices and our exchange rate is fixed, then it can be asserted that there will be no major fluctuations in import prices. Import prices do not change due to the stability of the exchange rate, while the general price level in the country gradually rises. The meaning is that the sales of foreign goods are more convenient. If there is no other factor at work, it is inevitable that imports will increase and the balance of international payments will turn to be unfavorable. This is one. Secondly, export prices rise day by day, and the exchange rate has been fixed. The meaning is that the selling price of our country's goods abroad gradually rises, and the result will inevitably affect our country's export trade. This is also a question. Under the circumstances that the exchange rate is fixed and export prices rise, if there is no other special force at work, it is inevitable that the export capacity will be weakened as a result. We further compare with the specific situation in our country, which makes us have to have this suspicion. Let us now look at the extent of the rise and fall of prices in June of this year and the same period last year:</p>
<p>The export price in June of this year was 27.1 percent higher than in June of last year, while the import price only rose by 18.6 percent. Wholesale prices rose by 14 percent, and no other country in the world has risen as fast as ours. Export prices should theoretically be in line with international prices, and the result of rapid increases will inevitably lead to a loss of balance with international prices, making our country's international trade also tend to be unfavorable. This is a very possible trend. Looking at the recent international trade situation, we have to have this worry. For example, the export index of agricultural products once jumped to above 100 during the currency reform, but now it has fallen to between 60 and 70. Therefore, we believe that under the circumstances of a stable exchange rate, a continued rise in export prices is by no means beneficial without any drawbacks. If there is no stable solution, it is feared that it will be a hidden danger for the future.</p>
<p>In short, in our opinion, although prices rose once after the currency reform, they immediately maintained a considerable degree of stability. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. What we hope for in the future is still the steady stability of prices, and absolutely not galloping prices. As for export prices leaving import prices and continuing to rise on their own, we also recognize that it is beneficial within an appropriate limit, but if the trend remains unchanged for a long time, the result may inevitably affect our country's international balance of payments. It seems that we should not hope for high prices today, but should hope for the stability of export prices and the general price level. The government's policy should also be based on this point. Here, we want to add a warning that the stability of prices is a necessary condition for the stability of the exchange rate. In order to seek the stability of prices, the issuance of legal currency must be repeatedly cautious.</p>
<h3>The Essence of China's Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongming</p>
<p>—And the Mission It Bears—</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement is a product of the ailments of capitalist society, which have already taken shape and are increasingly exposed. The maladies of capitalist society, in economic form, are exposed as the threefold contradictory phenomena of "inequality," "insufficiency," and "instability." Once this phenomenon envelops the entirety of capitalist society, the bright and brilliant golden world of capitalism immediately transforms into a dark hell of panic, war, carnage, unemployment, hunger, and death.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement is one of the various methods to save this tragic fate. Advanced cooperators, from the perspectives of ethics, sociology, and economics, recognize the cooperative movement as the only way out for human society. Only by managing society and the world with cooperative qualifications can humanity step into a peaceful and beautiful "world of great harmony."</p>
<p>This extremely grand ideal and goal are undoubtedly worthy of our admiration. However, no two countries in the world have completely identical historical backgrounds, nor do they have completely identical social systems. Social movements arising from different historical backgrounds and different social systems naturally cannot have completely identical standard models. Secondly, the establishment of a social movement theory is initially an attempt by some great seers or progressive scholars and theorists, inspired by objective facts and lofty ideas, to create a grand worldview. However, due to differences in the objective things that each person perceives and the research methods adopted, even though they start from the same starting point, the results are vastly different.</p>
<p>The paths taken by cooperative movements in various countries around the world, as mentioned above, have evolved into the current complex and uneven situation, either due to different national conditions or due to differences in the viewpoints of leaders.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement in capitalist countries is merely a tool to appease farmers and workers, avoid panic, and alleviate social revolution. The cooperative system it adopts is an appendage form based on capitalism. The cooperative movement in socialist countries takes socialist economic construction as a prerequisite, and in terms of development steps, it is a concession to the communization of backward rural areas. In addition, pure cooperativists, due to differences in viewpoints and theories held, have distinctly formed two camps: the consumer faction and the producer faction.</p>
<p>Since the cooperative movement in various countries around the world has such divergent and complex trends, it is essential to conduct a concise review of the theoretical basis of the various trends mentioned above before deciding which cooperative system China's cooperative movement should adopt.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The field of economic research usually includes four sectors: production, exchange, distribution, and consumption. It was only recently that these four sectors were fully enriched in economics. Adam Smith only paid attention to production and exchange. Malthus and Ricardo began to pay attention to distribution. Marx negated the production of capitalism from the development of production, exchange, and distribution. Since the marginal utility school, the subject of consumption has been regarded by scholars as a proposition that should be strictly noted. This evolution in the history of doctrine is, in fact, the corresponding reflection of the evolution of economic history.</p>
<p>The highest goals of the consumer and producer factions of the cooperative movement are not necessarily different; the difference lies only in the starting point. The consumer faction recognizes consumption as the purpose of economic life, and production is merely a means to satisfy this purpose. Therefore, consumption behavior is a universal behavior that everyone must possess. As a result, the consumer camp has an absolute majority compared to the producer camp. Consumers in capitalist society are completely dominated by specific production relations, and the oppressed and the sacrificed are the large groups of consumers. Only when consumers organize themselves and manage production in a planned and methodical manner can the maladies of capitalist society be eradicated. Therefore, the cooperative system advocated by the consumer faction, under the four principles of making the best use of things, making the best use of talents, abolishing profits, and satisfying needs, develops consumer cooperatives, organizes wholesale cooperatives, and then directly establishes production enterprises to complete the ultimate goal of consumers managing production.</p>
<p>As for the theory of the producer faction, it retains many sentiments of French utopian socialism and British Christian socialism. Fourier wanted to create another "phalanstery" production organization to replace the contradictory society of oppression and resistance, thus pioneering French production cooperation. Christian socialists, from a doctrinal and ethical perspective, sympathized with the poverty and lowliness of the working class's life, believing that workers could only enjoy human happiness by organizing production cooperatives.</p>
<p>In addition, the cooperative systems adopted as policies by capitalist countries and socialist countries are either a temporary appendage under the inherent system or a temporary transitional bridge before the ideal system can be realized immediately. Socialist countries have their unique political institutions to manipulate freely. It goes without saying that the cooperative system of capitalist countries cannot develop into a general main and central social system.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>China's cooperative movement should be the cooperative movement of the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People is the only doctrine for solving all revolutionary problems in China. "The primary task of national construction lies in the people's livelihood." The philosophical foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood lies in the historical view of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the foundation of China's cooperative movement should also be placed on the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Accordingly, "life" is the ultimate purpose of humanity, and consumption and production are merely two processes of a means adopted to satisfy this purpose. Therefore, from the standpoint of the Three Principles of the People cooperative movement, consumption and production should be unified in the same entity of the Three Principles of the People cooperative movement, and should not be arbitrarily divided into two opposing camps of producers and consumers, which is to demand the coordination of consumption and production to complete the entire solution of the people's livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, China's cooperative movement is a movement for the economic autonomy of the nation. The oppression suffered by the nation is mainly the economic oppression of the imperialists. As a result of the economic aggression of the imperialists, China's society as a whole has fallen into a deep abyss of panic. The mission of China's cooperative movement is to bear the burden of establishing China's independent economic unit and strive for the economic autonomy of the nation from the international imperialist economic aggression. Furthermore, China's cooperative movement is the backbone of the national economic construction movement. China's production is backward and needs to engage in the national economic construction movement. This is essentially different from the social reform movement of capitalist society, which has reached the extreme of production and only requires solving the problem of distribution and consumption. Therefore, the mission of China's cooperative movement is to build economic national defense and defend against aggression on the one hand, and to develop production enterprises and strive for self-sufficiency on the other hand. Under this goal of economic construction, increasing agricultural and industrial production has become a decisive prerequisite. To break the gap between urban and rural areas and to take steps to adjust agriculture, industry, and commerce, we can only strive to engage in cooperative national economic construction.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Finally, China's cooperative movement is a movement to create sound units of local self-government. Local self-government takes the complete security of the people's lives as a prerequisite, and the stability of the people's lives can only be guaranteed by the widespread development of cooperative enterprises. The Premier, in the law on the commencement of local self-government, pointed out that the undertakings to be undertaken by local self-government organizations include agricultural cooperation, industrial cooperation, trade cooperation, banking cooperation, and insurance cooperation, in addition to six items such as clearing household registration and establishing institutions. Cooperative enterprises are to follow the various cooperatives suggested by the Premier to establish a collective social life center. As a result of this development, it will surely succeed in becoming a central overall social organization. From this, the establishment of a social organization centered on cooperatives will promote the soundness of the basic unit of local self-government, and the realization of a truly national, classless, and democratic politics will be assured.</p>
<p>The China of the Three Principles of the People does not adopt the capitalist system that is gradually being destroyed, does not recognize classes, opposes struggle, and does not have the unique organization of socialist countries. The entire nation promotes the truth, goodness, and beauty of "life"; at the same time, it should coordinate the entire process of production and consumption.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's cooperative movement cannot blindly copy imported forms, but should, as mentioned above, under the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People, according to the great goals of national economic independence, national economic construction, and the establishment of sound local self-government, adopt a regular and appropriate posture. At the same time, China's cooperative system should also organically and closely link producers and consumers according to the various missions borne by China's cooperative movement, follow the categories suggested by the Premier, and carry out a peaceful, balanced, and universal development to establish the political and economic social center of the Three Principles of the People, and further create a fair, equal, fraternal world of great harmony, and build an unparalleled happy "Eden" for the whole world and all mankind.</p>
<h3>The Film Industry Under the Control of Financial Capital</h3>
<p>— Sha Tuo</p>
<p>Overview of the Film Industry in Various Countries by Sha Tuo</p>
<p>Film is the darling of the modern era, and the film industry has become one of the most important industries in the modern era. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, there were 87,299 movie theaters worldwide last year, including 15,378 in the United States, 5,070 in the United Kingdom, 4,782 in Germany, 4,221 in Italy, 4,000 in France, 1,634 in Japan, and 1,833 in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>In terms of film production, the United States is, of course, the number one. On average, it can produce 700 popular films each year. The United Kingdom can produce 190 films a year, and Germany and France can each produce more than 100 films a year. Although the number of movie theaters in Japan is not as high as in the Czech Republic, the number of films produced each year is more than 400, second only to the United States, which cannot be considered a contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>Countries with thousands of movie theaters can only produce about 100 films each year, which is certainly not enough. Therefore, with the exception of the United States and Japan, movie theaters in other countries almost always show foreign films as well. The films produced in Japan are only enough for self-sufficiency and cannot be exported. The United States is certainly the most dominant force in the world film industry. Almost 70% to 80% of the films shown around the world are American films. Therefore, there is no country that does not feel the pressure of American films. As for China, it goes without saying. Just look at the first-class movie theaters in the country, how many of them are not using Hollywood beauties as a selling point!</p>
<p>The Financial Capitalization of the Film Industry</p>
<p>Although China's film industry has shown some vitality in recent years, it is still lagging behind in both quality and quantity. In terms of quantity, the annual film production is probably less than 50 films. In terms of quality, I wonder how many good films there are each year. Japanese films, although proud in terms of quantity, are mostly of poor quality. This is because film in Europe and the United States has become a large enterprise, with the assistance of financial capitalists. In China, the capital interest rate is at least one cent or more. Ordinary industries cannot afford this high-interest capital, let alone the emerging and immature film industry. We can see that the American film industry, although it only began to develop after the European War, has made rapid progress in the past 20 years. This is entirely due to the development of American financial capital after the European War, and the film industry has also become financially capitalized. The current investment in the film industry in the United States is more than 2 billion U.S. dollars. The cost of film production alone is 150 million U.S. dollars each year.</p>
<p>In addition to the United States, the film industries in the United Kingdom and Germany also have considerable financial capital power as a backing. In other countries, the degree of integration between the film industry and financial capital is very shallow.</p>
<p>The Absorption of Fixed Capital</p>
<p>The method of the film industry absorbing fixed capital is similar to that of general industries. In the United States, investment banks and trust companies are generally used to issue stocks or corporate bonds, and then they are publicly auctioned on the stock exchange. The bonds of the British film industry are mostly long-term, usually around 10 years. The film industries of France and Germany rarely issue their own bonds, and their funds mostly rely on bank supply. Therefore, the power to produce films is also in the hands of financial capitalists. Everyone knows that the boss of the German Ufa company is a arms dealer, so the films it produces are based on the principle of promoting militarism and advertising the sale of arms.</p>
<p>As for the production funds, they have a liquid nature and a short recovery period, so there is no need to issue bonds. For example, in the United States, the cost of making a film sometimes reaches 2 or 3 million yuan. This kind of funding must rely on banks. The American film production year starts in July each year. Around May or June, the film industry giants have to personally set out to negotiate loans with banks. However, banks are only willing to provide funds to film production companies, and are mostly unwilling to invest in individual producers. Therefore, individual producers mostly promote films to companies that sell films.</p>
<p>Most French films are personal works, and it is difficult to obtain financial assistance in their own country. In recent years, it has been invaded by American capital. American film companies often provide funds to outstanding French producers, and their works are sold in France and imported into the United States. This can be said to be a process of internationalization of the film industry.</p>
<p>After the National Socialist Party took power in Germany, it set up a propaganda department to control the film industry. On the one hand, it restricted the import of foreign films, and on the other hand, it promoted domestic films. The official Deutsche Bank has a huge investment in the Ufa film company every year. At the same time, there is a film industry credit bank that specializes in providing capital to individual producers.</p>
<p>Methods of American Banks Investing in the Film Industry</p>
<p>American banks or trust companies invest in production companies, usually on a per-film basis. Each film's loan must be contracted separately, so it can be called a fractional investment. When a film company wants to borrow money from a bank, it must first submit the following documents to the bank authorities: (1) the story of the film, (2) the cast, (3) the production budget, and (4) the financial report. As a result of the bank's review, if it believes that the story and the cast are perfectly matched, the work has the hope of success, and the production budget is indeed reliable, then it can order the loan. However, loans are paid as needed, just like current deposits. After the loan, the production company must submit a detailed production report every week, subject to bank supervision. If the bank believes that it does not conform to the pre-determined production procedure, it can stop paying the loan. Because of this, most American films can be released within the predetermined period.</p>
<p>Once the producer completes the negative film (the developed film, called negative film, its light and dark black and white are opposite to the captured object), it must be handed over to the bank for safekeeping as collateral for the loan. If the company that sells the film wants to reprint the positive film (PositireFilm is printed from the negative film, that is, the film shot on the screen), it can ask the bank to reprint it. However, the film sales company is responsible to the bank for handing over all the income from the new film to the bank for distribution. After receiving it, the bank first recovers the loan, and the surplus is handed over to the production company and the film sales company. After the bank recovers the loan, it can return the soft film.</p>
<p>The loan period is not fixed, and is generally based on the period of completion of the film. It is as early as three months and as late as six months. Loan interest is mostly deducted in advance from the loan.</p>
<p>Methods of the German Government Supporting the Film Industry</p>
<p>The method of German banks investing in production companies is roughly the same as that of the United States. Because the United States is an advanced country in the film industry, its investment methods and established rules are sufficient for other countries to emulate. However, German banks only lend 70% of the production cost per film to production companies, and the remaining 30% must be planned by the production company itself. This is afraid that the production company will rely on loans to install coarsely.</p>
<p>Germany has a film industry credit bank run jointly by the government and merchants, which can be said to be the only film industry bank in the world. This bank is the general organ of the National Socialist Party government that controls the national film industry. This bank has 30 million marks of government shares, directors appointed by the government, and directors appointed by the banking community. It is especially noteworthy that this bank is not only attended by important figures from the government and business circles, but also includes all industrial and commercial figures related to the film industry. For example, the film manufacturing company, sound film equipment experts, photography associations, and movie theaters all send representatives to be directors of this bank. Therefore, this bank has considerable supervision over the capital and technical aspects of the film industry. Only in this way can it implement the propaganda policy of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>The investment direction of this bank is all in individual producers. For example, if a famous expedition team wants to produce an adventure film and publicize the National Socialist Party's foreign policy, it can request a loan from this bank, and the bank can also send experts to guide it. In recent years, the achievements of German personal film production have been very satisfactory, which can be said to be entirely due to this bank.</p>
<p>The Development Path of China's Film Industry</p>
<p>China's film industry has indeed made progress in recent years, but compared with foreign films, both quality and quantity are still immature. The reason for this is that capital is lacking. Because of the lack of capital, the investment in personnel, equipment, and various aspects is inevitably simple and crude, and the production is of poor quality. What is even more pitiful is that even the crude and poorly made films that can be seen are only a few each year. Therefore, foreign films are imported in a steady stream. The economic loss goes without saying, and the impact on our spirit is great. Films from capitalist countries either promote the power of imperialism or advocate pornographic culture, and cannot be our spiritual food. Therefore, we should now learn from Germany and Japan, restrict the import of foreign films, and strive for film self-sufficiency. The government and the banking community should jointly assist domestic film companies. In this way, we can supervise the film industry and promote the rationalization of its film production methods and the scientificization of its management methods. If film production companies want to obtain capital assistance, they must also eliminate accumulated malpractices and strive for openness, and operate in a scientific manner. In terms of personnel and finance, everything must be open to the public, abandon the infighting between colleagues, and jointly build Chinese-based film art.</p>
<h3>Correction Letter from Tianjin Beiyang Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>To the editor: After reading the article titled "The Textile Industry in North China Under Japanese Control" in the Economic Supplement of your newspaper on July 20, I will not comment on whether the news about the various textile factories in Tianjin is completely reliable, but regarding the statement in your article that our factory was acquired by Japanese capital in June, this does not conform to the facts, and I hope you will correct it to avoid confusion. Our factory was originally leased and operated by Gongji, and it has suffered heavy losses in recent years, so it was transferred to Chengfu Trust Company for operation. All transfer and receiving procedures were completed on May 21, and it was published in the newspaper. Our company, for the livelihood of the workers, started operations on June 1. On the one hand, it actively reorganized, and it has been going smoothly for two months. On the other hand, it plans to thoroughly improve the original 25,000 spindles and expand it to more than 37,000 spindles. The drawings and plans have been largely finalized. This news has also been published in major newspapers in Tianjin, and I believe the editor has also seen it. Your newspaper has always been known for its fair and upright views and accurate news at home and abroad. Now, without careful investigation, it publishes this inaccurate text, which is a pity for your newspaper. I dare not speculate that the drafter has ulterior motives. In the future, regarding the news of the yarn factory, it is best to inquire in detail from the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the government agency or the Chinese Yarn Factory Federation of the commercial group, and do not engage in anti-propaganda for the national factory. I am very fortunate. Furthermore, the Chinese textile industry has been on the verge of danger in recent years due to various reasons. If the Chinese people and the government do not work together to save it, the national industry and the people's livelihood will be unimaginable. I hope you will take this into consideration. Chengfu Management Beiyang Commercial First Textile Factory. July 24.</p>
<p>Editor's note: In the article "The Textile Industry in North China Under Japanese Control" published in this supplement on July 20, regarding the Beiyang Yarn Factory, the editor added an annotation when sending the manuscript, just to cast doubt and verify the facts, which I think is what the readers have seen. After receiving the letter from the Beiyang Factory, I immediately inquired from the reply from the writer Sen Yu, only to know that the source of this news was "seen in the Shanghai China Daily on June 22, and also in the talks of the leaders of the yarn industry published in the Shanghai Daily Evening News on July 5 and 6, and in the Central News Agency Beiping telegram in the Current Affairs News on July 12, and in the Beiping special telegram in the China Daily on July 13. Since I saw the Tianjin telegram from your newspaper, the manuscript has been sent out, and it is too late to revise it. The person (the writer calls himself) deeply hopes that what was transmitted by the previous newspapers is not true, so that the national industry can retain a glimmer of hope, which is what we urgently hope for," and so on. Since it is based on newspaper reports, and the Beiyang Yarn Factory only corrected it after this article was published, it can be seen that it is not "ulterior motives" and "anti-propaganda."</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Exchange Public List, 448 Items Collected and Resolved Today</h3>
<p>For the Gold Exchange's public list for August, the short side had already settled yesterday, including 378 items from Qiafengyong and 70 items from Yuanchangyong. Today, the long side should collect 448 items, including 147 items from Yingxiang, 84 items from Futaiheng, 56 items from Qingfayong, 42 items each from Qianchangxiang and Dachangxiang, 35 items from Shengyuanyong, and 21 items each from Chunyuanyong and Hengchangyong. The settlement price is 1129 yuan. Excluding the public list's current month's items, there are 938 items remaining, including 9 long positions and 6 short positions.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Last Week, Abruptly Turned Downstream After Delivery</h3>
<p>Last week, from July 27 to August 1, the Huashang Securities Exchange was for the delivery of futures for July and the listing of futures for September. After another round of sharp rise in the market situation, it gradually turned downstream. The reason is that the market's rising wind was too strong. Once the floating long positions were released, it immediately caused fluctuations. Last week, only the August futures were traded on Monday. People's minds were extremely firm, and it rose another 8 jiao to 1 yuan 2 jiao. With the Guangdong affairs settled, this is a natural phenomenon. On Tuesday, the filming of the September futures began. The opening price was particularly attractive. Buyers were eager, fearing to fall behind. Category A even saw a high price of 70 yuan. Compared with the highest price of 71 yuan including interest in July, it exceeded a huge amount of 2 yuan, which was really too high. Therefore, there was no rumor in the decisive settlement, and the return wind had risen, and it suddenly returned more than half a yuan. However, it still rose by 1 jiao to 1 yuan or so. Wednesday was the delivery of July futures, and the market was closed. On Thursday, news from Guizhou Province poured in, and the floating long positions were uncertain. The falling wind immediately rose, falling by 8 jiao to 1 yuan 4 jiao. However, the market price was too high, and a slight loss could not stop the short side's selling. Although it was relatively stable on Friday, the falling wind was still huge on Saturday, falling another 1 yuan. Categories E, D, and C have all returned to the 60 yuan mark, and most of them have returned from the highest price by more than 2 yuan to more than 3 yuan. This is entirely caused by the too rapid rise. As a result, the market price has mostly returned by 1 yuan to more than 2 yuan. The total number of transactions totaled 35,170,000 yuan. The results of the overall rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Liverpool Closed, American Cotton Trading Very Dim</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, and each month rose by 4 to 5 pounds. Due to the closure of Liverpool, trading in the market was very dim.

<h3>Seafood: Squid Shortage Leads to Price Increase</h3>
<p>(Squid) Currently, the inventory in the city is scarce across all shops, especially for the box-packed squid, which is even more in short supply. Recently, Sichuan brokers have been actively purchasing. According to a telegram from Hakodate, over a hundred packages have already been shipped. However, due to supply shortages and price increases in the producing area, the cost of the goods in transit is estimated to be 88 or 89 yuan. Local merchants who received the news earlier have already been pre-selling to customers, with asking prices around 90 yuan, waiting for the goods to arrive and quickly resell them. Second-grade squid for Zhou is selling for 83 yuan for old stock, 84 yuan for cold storage stock, and 85 yuan for improved stock (high-quality box-packed squid). The inventory of American-produced Golden Mountain canned squid is also dwindling, with current transactions around 80 yuan.</p>

<p>(Berlin) The 11th Olympic Games opened today with participants from 50 countries. (Dispatch from Central News Agency Special Correspondent on the 1st) The United States, which dominated the sprint events at the Los Angeles Olympics four years ago, seems likely to maintain its authority at this year's Olympics. Jesse Owens clocked an astonishing 10.3 seconds in the 100m preliminary round, equalling the 1932 record of the bespectacled intellectual runner Tolan of Michigan. Owens' time was the best of today's preliminary rounds. In the second round, Owens further set a new world record with 10.2 seconds, witnessed by 80,000 spectators. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) At 10:30 AM on the 2nd, the men's 100m preliminary rounds were held at the stadium, divided into 12 groups, with the top two from each group qualifying. Chinese athlete Zhuang Jincheng got off to a slightly slow start in the fifth group, falling behind by five meters and failing to qualify. Cheng Jinguan, in the eighth group, fought bravely but finished fourth, six meters behind and failing to qualify. Liu Changchun had a good start in the eleventh group, running second until 30 meters, but then ran out of steam and failed to qualify by six meters. Simultaneously, the men's high jump preliminary round started at 1.70 meters, rising to 1.80 meters. Chinese athlete Wu Bi'xian cleared both heights, but failed to clear 1.85 meters on all three attempts, touching the bar on the third attempt and being eliminated. Also, the men's shot put preliminary round was held at the same location at 11:00 AM, where Chinese athlete Chen Baoqiu also failed to qualify. (Dispatch from Central News Agency Special Correspondent on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) China was unlucky today, with no athletes qualifying in four different preliminary events. Those eliminated were Zhuang Jincheng and Cheng Jinguan in the 100m, Wu Bi'xian in the high jump, and Chen Baoqiu in the shot put. Liu Changchun did not participate. Zhuang Jincheng participated in the fifth group of the preliminary round and had a good start, taking the lead until halfway, but gradually fell behind and finished fourth. The first place in this group was McFeigh of Canada, with a time of 10.8 seconds. Cheng Jinguan also had a good start in the eighth group preliminary round, but also finished fourth. The first place in this group was Buschmeyer of Germany, with a time of 10.7 seconds. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the Olympic Games; US Athletes Do Not Salute the Podium</h3>
<p>German Athlete Representative Takes Oath</p>
<p>At that time, the cannons fired in unison, and 1,000 homing pigeons were released simultaneously. The Olympic torch was then carried into the stadium by German athletes, and the Olympic flame was lit. This flame will continue to burn until the closing day of the Games on August 16th. After the opening ceremony, Louis, the winner of the marathon at the first Games, presented an "olive branch," symbolizing peace, to Chancellor Hitler. The audience then stood up and cheered, and the orchestra played a new Olympic piece composed by the famous German composer Strauss. Then, Ismer, a German athlete who had won a championship at the previous Games, led the team leaders from each country in taking the oath. Ismer stood in the middle, with the team leaders from each country standing around him in a semicircle. The ceremony was very solemn. The athletes of each country then left the stadium in formation, and the audience cheered to send them off.</p>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 2nd. Yesterday, the World Games were declared open by Chancellor Hitler with a simple speech, saying "I now declare the 11th Olympic Games open." Over ten thousand participants cheered before Hitler, and the 5,000 athletes from 52 countries passed by, saluting with the Nazi Party salute or other salutes. Thirty thousand homing pigeons were released, so that they could spread the news of the opening of the Games all over the earth. At the same time, the crowd sang the national anthem and the Horst Wessel song. The orchestra, led by the famous composer Strauss, played the Olympic song. At this time, a German athlete carried the torch from Greece to Hitler's platform and lit the Olympic flame. This flame will be extinguished only after the closing ceremony. When the Chinese team passed the podium, they received great cheers and did not perform the Nazi salute, but only removed their hats and placed them on their chests. When the American team passed in front of the podium, they suddenly received some boos, because the American team did not salute. (American rules do not allow the flag to be lowered, and some of the athletes in the team did not remove their headscarves.)</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 1st. The opening ceremony of the 11th Olympic Games was held this afternoon at 4:00 PM, with unprecedented grandeur and solemnity. From early morning, spectators had been entering the stadium one after another, waiting quietly. By the time of the opening, the stadium and surrounding streets were packed with people, totaling no less than 250,000. The Hindenburg zeppelin flew in the sky, circling the stadium several times, and the spectators cheered when they saw it. German Chancellor Hitler arrived at the venue at 3:30 PM, wearing a yellow uniform, with an Iron Cross on his chest and a swastika armband on his left arm. When he entered the stadium, the crowd stood up and sang the national anthem "Deutschland über alles", and all raised their arms in the Nazi salute. Then, a German girl presented the Chancellor with a bouquet of flowers. Shortly after, the national flag of the Chancellor and the five-ring flag of the Olympic Games were hoisted on either side of the podium. At this time, members of the Storm Troopers sang the national anthem in unison, and then the Olympic bell on the high tower rang out, and the flags of the 52 nations slowly rose to the top of the flagpoles and fluttered in the sky.</p>
<p>Louis Leads the International Parade</p>
<p>The athletes of each country then formed a team and entered the stadium, parading around the stadium once. The leader was Louis, a Greek who won the marathon at the first Olympic Games in 1896. He was 65 years old, dressed in ancient Greek costume, full of spirit, and marched forward. The audience cheered wildly. After Louis were the athletes of the Greek team, because the Olympic Games originated in Greece. The athletes of other countries marched in order according to the first letter of their country's name, and the last was the German athletes, as Germany was the host of the Games and should be at the rear. When the German athletes entered the stadium, the audience sang the national anthem again to welcome them.</p>
<p>Hitler Announces the Opening of the Games</p>
<p>After the parade, the athletes of each country lined up in the center of the stadium, standing quietly. Each team had a leader holding the national flag, standing in the front row, facing the podium. A small podium was set up in the center of the stadium. First, Lewald, Chairman of the German Committee of the Olympic Games, took the stage to speak, paying tribute to Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France, the founder of the modern Olympic Games. After his speech, Chancellor Hitler officially announced the opening of the Games.</p>
<p>Light Rain Does Not Reduce Enthusiasm</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Berlin, August 1st. 100,000 spectators had already gathered in the stadium before the scheduled opening time, in a fervent mood, waiting for this grand opening ceremony. Although it was drizzling, the enthusiasm of the spectators was not diminished. The only addition to the stadium was countless umbrellas. The "Hindenburg Men's Airship" appeared in the sky over the stadium, slowly approaching, like a large crow, and the crowds around the stadium were all able to see it clearly.</p>
<p>"I Awaken the Youth of the World"</p>
<p>At exactly 4:00 PM, German Chancellor Hitler, Count de La Tour, Dr. Lewald, and members of the Olympic Committee, all dressed in morning dress and wearing full chains, entered from the west entrance of the stadium, one after another. As the 100,000 spectators stood up to salute, the orchestra immediately played the German national anthem. Hitler then proceeded to the front of the stage and took his seat. At that moment, the drizzle stopped and the weather cleared up again. Umbrellas were no longer seen in the stadium until the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Olympic bell, hanging high on a 70-meter-high monument tower, rang loudly at this time, announcing its mission, saying "I awaken the youth of the world." As the cannons fired, the flags of the 52 nations rose one after another around the stadium, fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Athletes From All Nations Enter the Stadium in Single File</p>
<p>At this time, those whom the spectators had traveled thousands of miles to see were now present: the athletes from all nations entering the stadium in single file, passing the Chancellor's observation platform, circling the track once, and then regrouping in the center of the stadium.</p>
<p>Each team was led by an adjutant holding a white board with the name of the country written in German. Following this white board was the flag bearer of that country, and the coaches and managers of the team were arranged behind them. Finally came the athletes. The stadium was dazzling, because the uniforms worn by the athletes of each country were specially made and even more pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Each Team Salutes in Unique Ways</p>
<p>The salute of each team to Hitler was unique. No two of the 51 teams were the same.</p>
<p>The first team to enter the stadium was the Greek team, and the last was the German team. The athletes from the remaining countries were arranged according to the German alphabet of their country's name. Therefore, the Egyptian team (Egyptians) was the first, because Egypt in German is (Aegypten).</p>
<p>The Egyptian team saluted Chancellor Hitler with a raised hand, but the Argentine team turned to the right as a whole. The Austrian team lowered their flag to the ground, and the Belgians marched in goose step. The South African team removed their hats as a salute. As for the Swiss team, they had a special idea. The flag bearer threw the flag into the air and then caught it with his hand, doing so several times. The teams from Castile and Haiti saluted with shouts, but since each team had only one person, there was no one to echo the shout except for the flag bearer. When the French team entered the stadium, the entire stadium was silent. When the team's flag bearer passed in front of Hitler's observation platform, he lowered the tricolor flag almost to the ground, and all the team members gave the Olympic salute. Apart from the Austrian team, the French team was the most popular with the audience.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games Are Declared Open</p>
<p>After each team was in place, Dr. Lewald, in a brief speech, described the meaning of the Olympics. After this speech, Hitler stood up and said, "I declare the Olympic Games open." At that time, the applause was thunderous, and the people cheered. Amidst this enthusiasm, 3,000 homing pigeons were released at the same time. Many of them circled the stadium, admiring the athletes, and then flew off. Finally, the last bearer of the World Games torch, dressed entirely in white, walked slowly down the stone steps, across the stadium, holding the torch. The torch relay of thousands of miles had come to an end.</p>
<p>120,000 Homing Pigeons Released</p>
<p>On the opening day of the World Games, a total of 110,000 homing pigeons were released, with the aim of spreading the news of the opening of the World Games to all countries in Europe, and to compete for the fastest time. Many of these homing pigeons came from various parts of Germany, and also from Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and Austria. They have been released since 5:00 AM this morning, including many that have flown over 1,500 kilometers. The Olympic Committee has prizes for the winners.</p>
<h3>Women's Javelin Preliminary Round: New World Record Set; German Frau Fiehe Sets Record of 44.69 Meters</h3>

<p>(4) The First Games</p>
<p>Looking back at the first revived Olympic Games held in Athens, the capital of Greece, in 1896, everything was beyond the imagination of later generations. However, for an era forty years ago, such a grand scale was truly unexpected. The venue for the first meeting was a long and magnificent building, standing at the foot of Mount Hymettos and extending to the left bank of the River Ilisos. This ancient sports ground, recorded in history books, was able to reappear in the modern world. This sports ground was the first of its kind in modern Europe to be completed, funded solely by a patriotic Greek, Averoff. It is now the venue for the first Olympic Games. The forty-eight rows of marble grandstands added to its brilliance and grandeur, making it a sight to behold.</p>
<p>A total of thirty-four nations were invited to participate, but in reality, only twelve nations participated in the competition. There were only twelve events, and most of them were traditional Greek ancient programs. The people of Athens were in a state of excitement, and the whole city was decorated in splendor. The most exciting event was the marathon, a pure essence of ancient Greek national sport. The winner was greatly honored. King George I, accompanied by the Crown Prince, watched at the finish line and did not hesitate to shake hands with the marathon winner, Luis. His attendants also stepped forward to embrace Luis. At this time, Luis was no less than a triumphant general of ancient times.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Counterproductive</h3>
<p>— (Chen Liang)</p>
<p>On the road, there are already coolies who have "died of heatstroke," and the epidemic hospitals are also very "busy." The atmosphere is really heating up. "Fiery umbrellas rise high" and "the Red Emperor displays his power" are phrases that old newsmen can use. In this boiler-like situation, people who cannot afford the economic time to climb to the top of the mountain and lie on the beach have to form an inseparable bond with ice and fans.</p>
<p>Eating ice, fanning, going to roof gardens, going to swimming pools, people think are the only ways to relieve the heat. Therefore, ice, fans, gardens, water... are all regarded as kind and lovely cool places and cool things. Without these, there would be no way to spend the summer. But in fact, there are also those that are counterproductive. Look at the children on the streets scorched by the sun, covered in sweat, shouting "Shade, buy ice..." Why are their necks so red? Isn't a large piece of ice in their hands? But they are running and shouting because they are worried about the melting of the ice, and they feel even hotter from the effort of running and shouting.</p>
<p>This shows that: although the essence of ice is cool, those who sell coolness cannot enjoy it. In the shackles of life, even the things around oneself become a "burden" in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>Miss Ice Cream</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>At the "Dali Ice Cream Parlor" behind the three French parasol trees at the intersection, when Ice Cream was launched, a beautiful girl like a little bird came, with jet-black hair, dark eyes, and a curvy figure, between the glass-covered round tables. Like a butterfly, she fluttered around, serving the gentlemen-type customers in the whole room. She can speak fluent English, a few superficial French sentences, Mandarin with a three-point Hunan accent, and a few non-vulgar Cantonese sentences. Someone asked her what her surname was? She smiled playfully and said, "Ice Cream." So everyone called her "Miss Ice Cream."</p>
<p>It is said that this Miss Ice Cream was recruited through an advertisement in the old newspaper, with a contract for two months, and a monthly salary of forty yuan. At the same time, 5% of the total income of these two months is also paid as a bonus. According to estimates, she may be able to get about two yuan a day. In addition to the extra small account, she may get ten yuan a day. Because in the Dali Ice Cream Parlor. From morning to night, it is full of guests, because Miss Ice Cream is indeed too cute. A certain Dr. said that sitting in the Dali Ice Cream Parlor served by Miss Ice Cream can make you forget the high heat of more than 100 degrees on the street. So he goes to Dali at least three times a day and forgets the homework of the evening dance hall.</p>
<p>It is said that this Miss Ice Cream was born to a Guangdong father and a Changsha mother. She is currently a junior in the Department of Literature at a certain university in Beiping. This summer, she came to Shanghai for a trip with a friend, and temporarily filled the role of a daughter to entertain. Her family. Is very wealthy, so she plans to donate all the rewards she has received in these two months to several charitable organizations for expenses. Recently, she has been very interested in this kind of professional life. She said, "I may be able to get a lot of life experience in these two months. If I can get enough materials from the customers, perhaps, before the summer vacation next year, I will write a planned My Client."</p>
<p>Recently, there are often admirers who ask her for photos. She always charges a price of two yuan and gives a half-length photo of six and a half inches signed in English "A Promoter of Charity - Ice Cream." Because of the price of these two yuan, she also plans to donate all of it to charitable organizations. In addition, she has to receive one or twenty letters from strangers every day, some of which are teasing. When she receives these letters, she always says, "This is too superficial," and dismisses it with a smile.</p>
<h3>Lotus</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>The lotus flower is noble and supreme, truly as Zhou Dunyi said: "It emerges from the mud yet remains unstained, it is washed by the clear ripples yet is not seductive, it stands tall and pure, its fragrance travels far and becomes more clear." Those who live in Shanghai are limited by their location and do not have a pond to plant lotuses, so they place one or two tile jars in the courtyard, with green leaves and red buds swaying between the sparse curtains. They feel that this is a kind of scenery. Comforting emotions is better than nothing, and it is appropriate.</p>
<p>The Six Yan Zhai Notes says: "Every year when the lotus first emerges from the water, before it reaches the edge of the leaves, it is often nipped by sudden rain. I came up with a new idea: cut lotus leaves and sew them into the shape of a helmet, called the lotus hat. Before the rain, I covered them all over, which was very helpful. I joked and sang: "If you want to spread your Lingbo steps, you must first prepare for the rain. The jade cover is deeply covering your forehead, and you are quietly hiding your fragrance. Don't rely on the tilted pearl cover, you should be the same as the jade sac inside. Pity yourself for being so small, waiting for the grace of light. If Master Lianxi knew, he would surely draw the owner of Six Yan Zhai as his confidant.</p>
<p>There is a secret to planting lotus: adding pig hair to the bottom can make the flowers flourish. Another way to tell whether the lotus will bloom is to look at the green veins on the leaf surface. If there are twenty-four, a flower will bloom. Also, if it does not bloom for a long time, it must be because of insufficient fertilizer. You can choose the deep green leaves and pick off a few stems to prevent them from absorbing too much nourishment, then the flowers will bloom faster.</p>
<p>In the past, Li Yu said: "The lotus is pleasing to the eye and the mouth. As for what is pleasing to the mouth, the lotus seeds and lotus roots are both placed on the table and mutually fragrant to the teeth." Gao Lian's Four Seasons Leisure Appreciation also said: "The taste of lotus seeds is best in the early morning. The water vapor floats at night, and it is just enough at this time. If the sun comes out and the dew dries, the freshness has gone by more than half. When staying overnight on the side of the Yue Wang Temple, there are the most lake lotuses. Slice a hundred rooms in the morning and eat them to your heart's content. Lotus root is best when it has been drained of water, and the green color is the most beautiful." With such a blessing, I don't envy the gods.</p>
<p>Sun Shushi and Lan Wei said that when they were young, they once traveled to Yuyuan Garden to watch Siamese lotuses. In those years, many famous people wrote poems and sang in harmony, and the good works were like a forest. The elegant story has been handed down, and even today there are those who can tell it. Since my family moved to the south of the city, Yuyuan Garden is close at hand. Unfortunately, the garden has been turned into public property and is not allowed to enter. I don't know if the jade fragrance and flower shadows still present auspicious signs or not.</p>
<h3>Cool Breeze Cave</h3>
<p>— Shang Shi</p>
<p>The Cool Breeze Cave of Stone Peng Mountain in Zhuji is the only cool and refreshing place during the sweltering summer. It is about twenty miles from the city, filled with crisscrossing and disorderly rocks with very few gaps. The cave is located halfway up the mountain, and beside it is a solitary temple, desolate and bleak. After taking a few steps, one arrives at the Cool Breeze Cave. The cave entrance is not wide, about three feet in diameter, so one must stoop to enter. Gradually, it becomes higher, and after more than ten feet, the rocks rise up, higher than the entrance, allowing one to stand upright. However, within, the yin wind howls angrily, and the cold air is oppressive. After two or three feet, many dare not go further. The rocks are jagged, with many side caves, all dark and without light. The cave is also narrow, requiring crawling. One must have a light and hold a rope. Because the cave is deep and winding, one end of the rope must be tied outside the cave, and the other end held while proceeding, releasing it as one goes. When exiting the cave, one can return by following the rope, avoiding the suffering of getting lost. Because the cave is yin and cold, one can freeze food inside even during the hottest days. If one is sweating profusely while climbing the mountain, upon reaching the cave, one will immediately feel the cold air penetrating the heart, requiring a lined jacket. The coolness is truly evident. Cold air often spills out of the cave, appearing as a misty smoke when viewed from afar. Near the rocky cliffs, the cave is dripping wet, even more refreshing. Locals say the cave is extremely deep, leading directly to the Qiantang River; however, no one has ever been able to reach its end, so the truth of this cannot be verified. There are many local legends about the cave; some say that thirty-six immortals once played the xiao and flute near the cave; others say that the cave was formed by the disorderly rocks from King Qian Chu’s whipping of the mountain. These are all folk tales and cannot be relied upon.</p>

<h3>The Phoenixes Switch Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Sound are Uncertain, Floating and Sinking; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted, Generously Sending Elegies</p>
<p>Although the snow-white rice was served in a large bowl, it did not arouse his appetite. He had no choice but to sit down, pick up his chopsticks, and first select a small pinch of white rice, putting it in his mouth to chew. Old Mrs. Tong sat at the head of the table, just about to pick up her chopsticks and bowl, when she saw his listless appearance, so she asked: "Why can't you eat?" Guoqi smiled: "This afternoon, I ate some snacks at school. Now that it's time to eat, I don't feel like eating." Old Mrs. Zhang said: "If you can't eat, then don't eat." Guoqi said: "I just want to eat tea-soaked rice with some pickles." Old Mrs. Zhang said: "You are using your mind a lot these days, but you can't eat too much, as that easily leads to food stagnation." Guoqi couldn't help but be touched by this. His mother's thoughtfulness was indeed comprehensive. So he pushed away half a bowl of rice and soaked the remaining rice thoroughly with tofu soup, then slurped it down. After the meal, Old Mrs. Zhang said: "I told you not to eat, but you insisted on eating this large half-bowl. Don't go to the study to read right away, go out and play, or chat with friends." Guoqi naturally couldn't refuse his mother's words, but he was feeling very passive, so he put on his hat and went out, wandering around the nearby alleys. He didn't particularly pay attention, but his feet naturally led him to the alley near the Jiang family's residence. By this time, the sky was already dark, and the long, straight alley seemed even more gloomy. Although there were electric lights in this residential area, there was only one light for every few dozen households. That one electric light, on the electric pole, emitted a yellowish color, which seemed particularly desolate to those with worries. Just as he was walking slowly like this, feeling very uneasy, a large door opened beside him. Two women came out. The woman in front held a glass lantern, muttering: "We have to go to the main street again. Our young lady is sick again. Always bothering people." The woman behind said: "Look at the back building, it's open on three sides. On nights with a big moon, she opens the windows to admire the moon. Letting the cool breeze blow all night, how could she not get sick?" The woman with the lantern said: "Where did she catch a chill? She even went out this afternoon. I think girls get preoccupied when they grow up. She's suffering from lovesickness." As they spoke, the two women walked away. The large door was half-closed, revealing a sliver of light. Guoqi looked closely and saw that it was indeed the Jiang family's residence. Because he passed through the nearby area every day, going through dozens of alleys, he had occasionally walked through this place before. Once, he had seen Jiang Menglan getting out of a rickshaw here. (55)</p>

<h3>Ice Cream Factory Sketch</h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>It's hot! It's that time of year again when ice cream hits the market. Indeed, it seems that for Shanghainese people who are so particular about food, they only have ice cream to rely on to get through the summer. So ice cream has become the only summer treat for the privileged class. However, the workers who make ice cream don't get to taste it, even though they sweat while they work.</p>
<p>We walked past Linban Road and entered the ×× Ice Cream Factory. We were greeted by a young man in a Western suit. We signed our names in the visitor's registration book and began the tour.</p>
<p>We climbed up to the fourth floor, which was the mixing room—where the raw materials for ice cream are blended. However, when we visited, we didn't see anyone mixing ingredients, perhaps because they had already stopped? Only two or three workers were cleaning up. We just listened to the report from our host, like listening to a teacher explain the principles in a science class, giving us a report on the ingredients and procedures for mixing ice cream. There was also a machine for making artificial butter, and we only saw waxy yellow things that looked like inferior soap bars constantly rolling out.</p>
<p>We went back downstairs, passed the laboratory, and then went to the freezing room, where the mixture from the mixing room is sent to be frozen. This is where the ice cream sold on the market is made. All the packing is done by female workers, and we saw them constantly packing. According to our host, there are four freezers in the freezing room, and each freezer can make ten gallons of ice cream in fifteen minutes. Each gallon can be packed into about six dozen paper packages. He also said: "We produce at least one thousand gallons a day." From this, we can imagine the eating power and consumption level of the people in the metropolis.</p>
<p>On the way back, the scorching sun beat down on our heads and backs, making us feel uncomfortably hot. As we passed a corner, we saw a rickshaw puller drinking tea from a roadside tea stand. Then, a contrasting scene of an exquisite ice cream parlor flashed into my mind.</p>
<p>We entered the house, covered in stinky sweat.</p>

<p>Summer Special</p>
<h3>A Calm Mind is Naturally Cool</h3>
<p>— (Baiguo)</p>
<p>Actually, what is this secret? Even women and children know it. But everyone is unwilling to follow it! That method is the saying that a calm mind is naturally cool. Except for those high officials who already have electric fans and ice soda. This is indeed a unique and economical way to cool off that suits the common people, so why don't people do it? In fact, one only needs to take a detached view of everything external. Why always be restless, just shortening your lifespan? Moreover, in the hot summer, if your mind is calm, the inside is cool, and the outside is also cool, isn't that good?</p>
<h3>Escaping the Heat at a Waterside Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Cai Xuanqing</p>
<p>Zhao Kui, the Song Dynasty Prime Minister, a native of Liyang County, was at the time an admonisher, impeaching him for being illiterate. Kui angrily resigned, and although an imperial edict was issued to appease him and keep him in office, he firmly refused to comply. He returned home and built two waterside pavilions, one in the north of the county and one in the south, several miles apart. He would escape the heat in the pavilions during the summer. He once composed a line: "The waterside pavilion is surrounded by vermilion railings on all four sides, and schools of fish play among the duckweed." The six dragons fear the heat and cannot travel, and the sea water boils away, revealing the Penglai Island. Lying asleep with a seven-foot white beard, his head pillowed on a branch of green agate. He only composed six lines before falling asleep, and his serving maid, Lianxiang, added the rest: "The Prime Minister still finds the fan too weak, and the travelers are still on the dusty road." Her phrasing was elegant and reminiscent of Zheng Jia's poetry maid. I recall that when I was in the army for more than ten years, marching in the intense heat was the most difficult thing. I sought the shade of a wretched tree to rest for a moment, but it was not to be found. I happened to see layers of clouds blocking the sun, and I immediately felt a moment of coolness, and I composed a line, "The fiery parasol in the sky burns fiercely, and the travelers on the dusty road suffer the most. How can I always have thick clouds blocking the sun, so that a cool shade can be spread everywhere to dispel the heat?"</p>
<h3>Escaping the Heat in Keyan</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Keyan in Shaoxing is truly a cool and refreshing world. Hu Tianyou's "Collection of Shijian Mountain House" lists the stone quarries of Yue, praising the Seven Star Rock of Ke Xi, praising the artificial axe carvings for their strange shapes. If we enter Keyan in the summer, we have not only the cool stone chambers that caress the skin, but also the tall bamboos that shield the sunlight. And the several pools of blue water and the broken railings also stir up people's secluded emotions. However, there are also some questionable aspects, which lie in the dilapidated state of the buildings, the lack of cleanliness, and the scarcity of pavilions and courtyards where visitors can sit, lie down, and rest. The other day, a newspaper carried a report about a Shanghai travel agency promoting escaping the heat in Keyan; the stone colors, pool light, and gloomy coldness of Keyan can indeed attract summer tourists.</p>
<h3>Summer in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>The umbrella-like sun hangs in the sky, and summer has quietly arrived in the world. The whole of Shanghai is melting.</p>
<p>The buses are especially crowded, and the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park has broken the record for the year.</p>
<p>Black-licensed cars speed into the French Concession, and pot-bellied gentlemen kiss the red lips of young girls in the dark carriages, while the chauffeurs curse the American sailors who are hugging saltwater girls and getting drunk.</p>
<p>Every tram platform is packed with people, which is the most economical way for poor young men to go for a ride.</p>
<p>"Ice cream, sour plum soup, shaved ice, Russian soda." Every street is filled with these seasonal trades.</p>
<p>"I hate this, a caged bird, with wings but unable to fly." A bachelor in a west-facing room keeps chanting his old tune.</p>
<p>Summer is in Shanghai, and the whole of Shanghai is melting.</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<p>Record of the Appearance of Inferior Medicines</p>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<h3>The Failure of "Transmembrane Sterilization" Drugs</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang, who lives on Nanjing Road, contracted gonorrhea about two months ago. First, he was mistreated by a quack doctor with a crude operation, and then he was introduced to oral vaccines, claiming that they had the effect of "transmembrane sterilization." Mr. Wang had some medical knowledge and said that vaccines are external injection drugs, so how could someone take gonorrhea bacteria orally? He hesitated and could not decide, but the quack doctor still advised him to take them. Mr. Wang reluctantly took them, and instead of benefiting, he suffered. The urethra became blocked, and he felt distending pain and tearing. The perineum and anus were very sore. He was introduced by a colleague to me for treatment. After examination with a microscope, the mucous membranes of the affected area were covered with gonorrhea bacteria, like a mass of hair. Thus, inferior medicines that advertised "transmembrane sterilization" were proven to be a complete failure. I performed surgery and electrical therapy, and instructed him to take "Kelinong" to dispel gonorrhea, reduce inflammation, prevent putrefaction, and promote urination. After taking six or seven bottles, the disease finally subsided. After a blood serum test, there was no gonorrhea toxin reaction, thus proving that he was cured.</p>
<p>Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<h3>Doctor Zheng Yuanhe's Casual Talk on Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Clinic: At the intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Clinic hours: 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>To Eradicate Lung Tuberculosis Lesions, First, You Must Strengthen the Internal Defenses of the Lungs</p>
<p>Do you have lung disease?</p>
<p>When we talk about treating lung disease, everyone knows that we must kill the tuberculosis bacteria, and then other symptoms can be cured. This is naturally a fundamental solution. But how easy is it to kill tuberculosis bacteria? Because their outer skin is a layer of fatty substance, which is highly resistant to acid. No matter how good your medicine is in theory, it is difficult to penetrate this membrane and kill the bacteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, a German lung disease expert named Tu Mei, who was a specialist professor at a university medical school, always wanted to invent an effective lung disease drug. Based on the principle that tuberculosis bacteria are easily susceptible to medicine after their membrane is removed, he created a drug to remove the outer membrane of tuberculosis bacteria and mixed it with other antibacterial and tissue-regenerating drugs. After many sterilization procedures, he successfully produced "Bufei Na'er." After repeated animal experiments, it proved to have the power to kill bacteria and cure tuberculosis. So he administered it to lung disease patients. Within a week, the tuberculosis bacteria in the patient's sputum disappeared, and other symptoms such as hemoptysis, fever, cough, phlegm, night sweats, chest pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss were also gradually reduced. The spirit gradually became vigorous, and in one or two months, the lungs were completely healed and scarred. However, this medicine must be taken for more than half a dozen at a time, because lung disease cannot be cured with one or two bottles. It is best to take this medicine in conjunction with "Buti Kang" for men or "Bvnvr Rong" for women. The reason is that lung disease patients often have neurasthenia, such as palpitations, insomnia, forgetfulness, etc., and women have irregular menstruation, and men have kidney deficiency and spermatorrhea. These two medicines can treat these diseases. Spermatorrhea must also be taken with "Nai's Yujing Pian".</p>
<h3>Cholera Can Be Avoided This Year, But— Epidemic Dysentery is Very Popular, Residents Must Pay Attention to Cleanliness in Food and Drink</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Although this year is a cholera cycle year, it may be avoided due to effective prevention. According to reports from health authorities, there is a tendency for epidemic dysentery to become popular. This type of dysentery is extremely fierce, and once infected, there is a danger of life. Although this is due to the prevalence of germs, the inducing cause is often caused by vomiting and diarrhea caused by acute gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>Acute gastroenteritis is a common disease in summer, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or watery stools, two or three times a day or dozens of times. Vomiting, nausea, aversion to food, fever, and burning sensation in the chest can easily turn into dysentery, so we should hurry up and prevent and treat it. At the beginning of gastroenteritis, we should choose to take "Qiangwei Jing", which clears the stomach and promotes digestion. This is a special medicine for the stomach and intestines invented by German Dr. He Baoningya. It can remove the corrupted and fermented food in the stomach and intestines, and it is guaranteed to heal after taking it. I have recently cured many people with this medicine, and I will draw up a form to report it later.</p>
<p>Acute gastroenteritis is also easy to become chronic. Once it becomes chronic, there will be loss of appetite, aversion to food, stomach stagnation, food that does not digest, belching, acid reflux, nausea, chest tightness, bloating and pain after eating, etc. Constipation, hemorrhoids, or loose stools, farting, and infant vomiting of milk and green stools caused by indigestion can be treated with this medicine to transform digestive function and supplement Rong Yang, so that it can be corrected step by step. Because it contains vitamin B and other Rong Yang ingredients, it is good for treating beriberi caused by lack of vitamin B and Rong Yang deficiency that has not recovered from a long illness.</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatment of Infertility</h3>
<p>— Physician Zheng Yuanhe</p>
<p>There are many causes of infertility, and menstrual disorders are the main cause. Patients often have premature or delayed menstruation, or heavy uterine bleeding, pale and withered complexion, weak body, and desire to fall when facing the wind, completely losing the typical healthy and beautiful appearance. How can there be any hope of conception? Even if they are fortunate enough to conceive, the children they give birth to are either short-lived or sick.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, it is appropriate to correct the ovaries, because menstrual disorders are mostly caused by a lack of follicular stimulation. If you want to treat it, you must increase the stimulus. "Bvnvr Rong" is a medicine made from ovarian hormones. It is indeed effective for infertility caused by menstrual disorders. Last year, Mrs. Lin Taixiang suffered from menstrual disorders, back pain, and weak legs for a long time. She had been married for four years and had not conceived a child. She had undergone medical treatment and taken various Chinese and foreign fertility drugs, but with no effect. After being introduced to me for treatment, I instructed her to take "Bvnvr Rong". After about five weeks, her menstruation came on schedule, her breasts were raised, and she had a child more than a year later, which made the whole family very happy.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Jvyan's Lectures on Reproductive System Diseases</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Clinic hours: 10 AM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Premature Extraction of Semen—Aphrodisiacs are Harmful</p>
<p>Semen is the lifeline of our people. Whether the body is healthy or not depends entirely on whether the semen is full or not. However, if the body is healthy and the semen is strong, the semen will inevitably be exhausted as a result of excessive masturbation and sexual activity. For example, premature ejaculation and spermatorrhea, and incomplete erectile ability of the penis are all manifestations of semen exhaustion. However, patients are greedy for immediate gain and do not seek fundamental treatment. They often purchase aphrodisiacs of the previous reproductive type to pre-extract semen and get excited for a while, and then immediately become depressed. If they are not given appropriate and reasonable treatment, not only will happiness be ruined, but also the greatest reproductive task in life will not be able to be carried out. Because this type of aphrodisiac is widely spread, there are often victims asking me for treatment. The following patient surnamed Zhou is an example.</p>
<p>After several months of discomfort, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation followed. Because he mistakenly believed in aphrodisiacs of the reproductive type, he felt excited for a while after taking them, but he became depressed afterwards and had to take them again before he could. Unexpectedly, after taking them for several weeks, even with a large amount of this type of inferior medicine, there was no effect. He hurriedly changed his treatment to me. After I examined him using scientific methods, I saw that his youth glands were paralyzed by this type of aphrodisiac, shaped like dead wood. In addition to static electricity therapy, I also administered a large amount of "Buti Kang" to transform the tissues of his reproductive glands and promote the production of new semen. In less than a month, he was completely cured, and everything returned to normal. His weight increased, and he returned to the appearance of his youth. All those who have taken aphrodisiacs of the reproductive type must pay attention to this type of bad consequences.</p>
<h3>Uterine Bleeding Caused by Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Jin Yver Ren</p>
<p>Most women think that leukorrhea is a disease that does not need to be treated, so they often ignore it. How can they know that the wettest parts of the human body's mucous membranes are the most easily infested by bacteria, leading to major problems? Often, due to the invasion of bacteria, heavy uterine bleeding occurs, so the uterus and vagina often have ulcers. The body gradually becomes thin and eventually exhausted. The leukorrhea, which was considered unimportant, now has the risk of endangering life.</p>
<p>Regarding the appropriate treatment for this disease, it is appropriate to administer "Ka er Xvdi's Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. This tablet has the effect of anti-corrosion, anti-inflammatory, pain relief, and bacteria removal. Regardless of the leukorrhea that has been going on for a long time or that has just started, it can be eliminated in three to several weeks after use, and the local area is as clean and dry as a virgin. The beauty of this tablet is that patients can buy it from pharmacies themselves without the need for a doctor's instructions. It has the effect of removing disease and has no adverse effects. This has long been recognized by the female community. For those caused by gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can also be taken, and for those with body pain and menstrual disorders, "Bvnvr Rong" can also be taken, so the effect is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Treatment Knowledge</p>
<h3>Fundamental Methods for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Zongkun of Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>There is no way out except for special therapies!</p>
<p>The harm of gonorrhea is already known to everyone. Improper medication can lead to hundreds of complications. The most significant are gonorrhea-related angina, valvular heart disease, arthritis, etc., which can either result in loss of life or become disabled. The danger cannot be overstated. Therefore, patients should be extremely cautious when choosing medication. In the past, because there was no specific medicine for gonorrhea, various preparations that emerged in response to the situation were constantly changing, such as transmembrane sterilization therapy and vaccine injections. I once used vaccine injections (patients should note that vaccines can only be injected and there is no reason to take them orally). Later, I saw that the side effects were very large, often causing dangerous pathological changes, so I stopped using it. At that time, I had just returned from the Imperial Medical University of Japan and was planning to travel to Europe when the medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" was invented. Its effective ingredients are the bile and lipids of animals and plants, combined with pigments that have already been purified to produce the "Kelinong" oral agent. I immediately became very interested and took this for clinical practice. Its rapid effectiveness and medicinal properties are beyond the reach of all gonorrhea drugs. Since this drug came out, doctors in German hospitals have been competing to use it, and it has spread throughout Europe and the United States. Patients, regardless of gender, are unanimously happy to use this drug, and they all achieve a radical cure with it.</p>
<p>According to my clinical experience, in addition to "Kelinong," it is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree to find a preparation with high quality and purity. Only "Kelinong" was invented by Dr. Beide, a world-renowned gonorrhea expert, and is an effective agent for treating various acute and chronic gonorrhea and complications. However, women can also use "Ka er Xvdi's Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which can shorten the time to recovery. "Kelinong" can enhance the human body's local and systemic anti-gonorrhea immunity and phagocytic power. It is guaranteed to provide a permanent cure after taking it!</p>
<p>Casual Talks About Sexually Transmitted Diseases</p>
<h3>What Causes Mental Depression? The Reason is Frequent Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Dai De</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is very harmful to the body and mind. The most obvious symptoms are thin body, mental depression, headache, head heaviness, back pain, genital pain, body fatigue, and a feeling of intense fatigue. The degree of spermatorrhea is always deepened by this. Insufficient penile erection and inability to reproduce also arise from this. The method of treatment is to take "Nai's Yujing Pian" to calm the nerves and consolidate the vas deferens, so that the tissues of the reproductive system return to normal. On the one hand, take more suburban walks to cheer up the spirit. Other pornographic books and paintings should be strictly forbidden. If you treat it properly in this way, the disease will be cured. I once treated a patient surnamed Fang who had excessive leakage, a thin body and sunken eyes, and his condition was extremely dangerous. I instructed him to buy "Nai's Yujing Pian" from the Western Medicine Department of Yong An Company and swallow it. After swallowing less than four or five bottles, it was miraculously cured. This fact is better than eloquence.</p>
<h3>Disease Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Perineal Distending Pain</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Cheng Qianyv, Your gonorrhea is causing urinary obstruction and perineal distending pain due to misdiagnosis with inferior medicine. The toxin has penetrated deeply, causing complications of posterior urethritis and prostatitis. You can take "Kelinong" to kill bacteria and dispel gonorrhea. It is also good to ask Dr. Yao Jvyan for examination and treatment.</p>
<p>Daily Weight Loss</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Li Jv Yu, your illness has become sexual neurasthenia, so you have symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence. Also, because you worry that sexual arousal and semen cause daily fat loss, your weight is decreasing. In addition to abstinence and quitting masturbation, you can take "Buti Kang" to strengthen the nerves and promote the strengthening of the reproductive system. Then premature ejaculation and other diseases can be cured, and your weight can gradually recover and increase. Be sure not to take excitants such as aphrodisiacs again, so as not to fall into an irreversible situation.</p>

<h3>Insomnia and Opium</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Insomnia is a kind of illness, but among opium smokers, nine out of ten suffer from insomnia. This shows that opium addiction and neurasthenia are greatly related. Therefore, to quit opium, one must first cure the neurasthenia and clear the opium toxins. This can be exemplified by the following case.</p>
<p>Mr. Su Chunsheng, due to suffering from spermatorrhea, became addicted to opium. Every night, he would light a lamp and continue smoking until dawn, which was a sign of nervous hyperexcitability. His body weakened day by day. Recently, with the vigorous enforcement of the anti-opium campaign, he attempted to quit several times. However, he didn't quit the disease when quitting opium, nor did he quit opium when quitting the disease. Although the opium was quit, the illness relapsed. He asked me to help him quit. I prescribed "Bokang", an emulsion of egg yolk and endocrine preparations, from the Zhongxi Pharmacy. After taking it for two weeks, his opium craving lessened day by day, and within a month, his nightly smoking completely stopped, and he developed a dislike for opium. This is because "Bokang" has the effect of restoring anesthetized nerves, clearing opium toxins from the blood, and strengthening the tissues of the reproductive system. Therefore, its efficacy is unmatched by ordinary opium remedies. Since graduating from the Army Medical University, I have been in clinical practice for over thirty years, and I have used "Bokang" to help many people quit opium addiction.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in Job Seekers in This City</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>A sudden increase in job seekers is another way of saying that there is a sudden increase in the unemployed. This is based on statistics obtained from the Employment Guidance Center, as reported by the *Ta Kung Pao* a few days ago. Since this month, the number of requests for consultations and applications for job registration at the Guidance Center has been increasing daily. The maximum number has reached eighty or ninety people per day, and the minimum has been more than fifty. On average, the total is around sixty people per day. It is said that the reason for this sudden increase is partly due to the unemployed seeking employment and partly due to school graduates. Because this month is the end of the term for various schools, students who have completed their studies are rushing to register, which has caused the numbers to increase sharply.</p>
<p>I remember that several months ago, newspapers published the number of unemployed people in this city in 1935, issued by the China Branch of the International Labour Office, which totaled more than 600,000 people. If we take the city's population as three million, then one in every five people is unemployed. However, this was only last year, and whether the estimated figures they obtained are accurate is still questionable. However, with the sudden increase of fifty or a hundred job seekers every day, we can see the general seriousness of the unemployment problem even more clearly.</p>
<p>Here, we believe that the sudden increase in job seekers today is largely due to the fact that various schools are in summer vacation, which has led to graduates who have completed their studies having to go to the "employment agency" to register first, because of the situation of "graduation is unemployment". Although they have finished talking and registering today, they still do not know on which day, which month, or which year half a seat will become available for them to squeeze into.</p>
<p>However, unemployment, unemployment, this phenomenon is by no means "always existed" - it should be known that in the primitive era of "drinking blood and eating fur, living in caves", human beings were living in a collective social life of "common labor, common distribution". Therefore, at that time, there was no such thing as "employment", and of course, there was no "loss" of it. However, today, with the rise and development of capitalism, this phenomenon - the unemployment problem - has become one of the serious social maladies that cannot be concealed in modern countries around the world. Moreover, before the economic system in capitalist countries, where the methods of production and property relations are always contradictory, is reformed and improved, this unemployment phenomenon will not go away for a single day.</p>
<p>However, in our country, which is known as "vast land, abundant resources, and numerous people", it cannot really be called a capitalist "civilized society". On the contrary, it is a completely semi-colonial social and economic organization. Therefore, for many years, under the various "cooperation", "assistance", and "support" provided by various capitalist powers competing for us in terms of economy, politics, culture... we have indeed benefited a lot from them. For example, the reason why this city has become one of the major commercial ports in the world and is honored as the "New York of the East" lies in this. However, the reason why the unemployment problem today is becoming increasingly serious also lies in this!</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Today, the so-called "New York of the East," Shanghai, is far less prosperous than it was four years ago before the "incident." We not only have hundreds of thousands, millions of unemployed people being driven to the brink of hunger and death, crushing and struggling, and students who have "completed their studies" facing the danger of "graduation is unemployment," but also people who are temporarily employed are worried about the arrival of the god of unemployment. Don't you see? The countryside is bankrupt, the cities are withering, and factories are closing down one after another, shops are liquidating, tightening, laying off employees... and even the expansion of puppet organizations and the rampant "special trade"... and so on!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that it is not only Shanghai, and it is not only "the end of the semester," that this serious number of unemployed people will continue to increase sharply, spread, and extend indefinitely, unless we urgently and thoroughly transform this semi-colonial economic organization...</p>
<h3>A Visit to the China Relief Society for Women and Children’s Orphanage (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>The children are managed by the auxiliary birth group of the orphanage, with each person in charge of ten children. The auxiliary birth personnel are selected from the women living in the orphanage. There is also a hygiene group, which specializes in cleaning and is divided into three groups, A, B, and C, each responsible for four hours. However, there is also a reward for those who perform this work. However, the hygiene group in the outer courtyard is staffed by boys.</p>
<p>Further in is the sewing room, where several old women are mending torn clothes. The storage room is where various clothes and supplies are piled up. On the left is the bathroom of the outer courtyard. Next to a large hall is a small dining room, where people with infectious diseases and other illnesses eat.</p>
<p>As for the inner courtyard, it is next door, separated from the outer courtyard and the kindergarten. There is also a dining room, a bathroom, and dozens of bedrooms here. The situation is similar to that of the outer courtyard, but the equipment is slightly different. And some of the girls are working on sewing machines, while others are embroidering or doing other things.</p>
<p>After visiting all the places for a week, when I returned to rest under the grape trellis in front of the office, I raised a few more questions, such as: the procedures for entering and leaving the orphanage, the situation of girls choosing a partner, the way out for boys, and the skills and production learned by the students in the orphanage.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei's reply: The boys and girls in the kindergarten here were originally transferred from the Public Concession Police Station, so there are no procedures for entering the orphanage. However, if there is an unfinished case or other reasons that require a court hearing, the orphanage must send someone to accompany them. Those who enter the orphanage must also be questioned and investigated in detail by the orphanage. If they have relatives, they will be taken away. If they are in another city, the orphanage will send someone to return them. If they really have no one to rely on, they will be officially allowed to stay in the orphanage, but they must go through a month of training in the education class first. As for leaving the orphanage, anyone whose family comes to pick them up can leave at any time. However, those who want to leave the orphanage must have been there for more than a year and have a proper place to go before they can be allowed.</p>
<p>Girls choose their partners once a year, but it is entirely with their consent. The orphanage is only in the position of a guardian, and those who do not want to choose a partner are allowed to do so. When boys reach a certain age, the orphanage will find ways to introduce them to various occupations or recommend them to work in factories.</p>
<p>While in the orphanage, in addition to assigning some labor service, girls are taught skills such as sewing and embroidery, and boys also have manual exercises. However, the work they do is rewarded by the orphanage to encourage them.</p>
<p>Students in the orphanage are absolutely forbidden to leave their own courtyard step, and if anything happens, they must be accompanied by the auxiliary birth personnel to the office to negotiate. Only the auxiliary birth personnel and the hygiene group can move freely in the orphanage.</p>
<p>Now, seventeen or eight of the kindergarten students in the orphanage have eye diseases. I hope that the authorities of the orphanage will pay attention to this. (The End)</p>
<h3>Watermelon Stall</h3>
<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>July, a scorching day.</p>
<p>People are waving their fans and complaining about the sun. Lao Wu, the watermelon stall owner, is sweating all over, but he is happy in his heart: seeing such a big watermelon, it sells out in less than half an hour, and he is happy to grin and smile. He has to thank the hot weather and the sun.</p>
<p>Every summer, when watermelons are on the market, Lao Wu's stall appears on this street corner. He has been doing this business for several years, and he knows almost everyone here. The people who come to buy his watermelons are all his regular customers.</p>
<p>Yellow-fleshed, thin-skinned big watermelons,</p>
<p>Three copper coins for a piece.</p>
<p>Lao Wu shouts this every day. Many passersby are attracted by his shouting, so they run over, throw down three copper coins, buy a piece of watermelon, and eat it. Lao Wu shouts even more vigorously.</p>
<p>This year the weather is particularly hot, and the power of the sun seems to melt the world, and even the leaves of the sycamore trees by the roadside are drooping. Lao Wu wipes his sweat with a towel, thinking happily:</p>
<p>--Damn it, God willing, if I sell this season, I can pay off my old debts!</p>
<p>However, that morning, when Lao Wu picked up the watermelon load again, ready to set up his stall, he found something more on the sidewalk opposite. It was a white lacquer cabinet, with large red letters written on the front: "Tianjin Sour Plum Drink." A canopy was stretched over the cabinet with a wooden frame, and there were also two potted plants with green leaves. A tall man stood majestically behind the potted plants.</p>
<p>Lao Wu's heart suddenly became unhappy, even a little resentful of the tall man. He shouldn't have set up here, stealing his Lao Wu's business. But later, he saw that the tall man's business was not very good, and although his own stall was a little less busy than yesterday, there were still many customers, and his previous resentment and unhappiness disappeared.</p>
<p>--See if you have the ability to pull my customers over.</p>
<p>He simply looked down on the tall man.</p>
<p>But the next day, he suddenly realized that the number of customers in front of and behind the tall man was gradually increasing, while very few people came to his own stall. After inquiring, he immediately knew that the tall man had reduced the price of sour plum juice, selling it for only three copper coins a cup, and it was iced. Lao Wu was so angry that he just rolled his eyes. After thinking about it, he had no choice but to reduce the price as well. He wiped the sweat that was about to flow to the corner of his mouth and shouted anxiously:</p>
<p>Big and sweet watermelons,</p>
<p>Only two copper coins for a big piece!</p>
<p>This shout was like a void, and the people walking by ignored him and walked past in a hurry; some turned to the opposite side.</p>
<p>--This dog! He's simply trying to kill me!</p>
<p>If he doesn't avenge this, can he still be considered a man?</p>
<p>He stared at the tall man with his two eyes.</p>
<p>The tall man had no business at this time, and he was also staring at him.</p>
<p>--What are you looking at me for? You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>The tall man walked over.</p>
<p>--Who are you cursing?</p>
<p>--What if I curse you? Go bite my balls!</p>
<p>He also greeted him, his face flushed, and breathing a little heavily. The tall man didn't say a word, and with one hand he slapped him, causing him to take a step back. He still wanted to rush up, but, thump! The tall man punched him in the chest and knocked him down, and overturned the stall, and watermelons rolled all over the ground.</p>
<p>--Good! Good job! If you're a good man, wait for me, don't run away!</p>
<p>He struggled to get up, picked up the watermelons on the ground, and said this as he left.</p>

<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>Upon receiving the court's judgment, Li Cheng's face turned white in fright. He felt as though he had fallen into an ice cellar and was shivering all over. "Pay the eight months' rent within the deadline, otherwise..." Li Cheng dared not continue to think so cruelly. His heart was being cut by thousands of knives. He saw his family of six, his elderly mother, his young wife, a niece without parents, and two young children, now being driven out onto the streets, like beggars. His elderly mother was just wailing loudly, and his children and wife were also crying. Ah! This tragic scene was flashing before Li Cheng's eyes, and Li Cheng almost died of anxiety.</p>
<p>His elderly mother and his young wife just stared blankly at him in a panic. Yes, what can be done? Money is not as easy to obtain as air. Stealing and robbing are crimes, even though stealing or robbing money is not for enjoyment or waste, but just to have a house for himself, his old mother, his wife, and his children to live in! But the law does not care about these things.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Sedan Chair Carriers (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zijing</p>
<p>—Chongqing Correspondence—</p>
<p>"What a Chongqing city, the mountains are high and the roads are uneven, climbing uphill is exhausting, riding in a sedan chair is like riding the clouds."</p>
<p>This is a popular folk song in Chongqing. From this folk song, you can know the importance of sedan chairs in Chongqing's transportation.</p>
<p>Chongqing is a commercial port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and it is also a strategically important mountain city in Sichuan Province. Looking up from the river bank, the layered city houses and streets are all placed on cliffs, which is very dangerous and unusually high. People who grew up in the foreign concessions of Shanghai, even if they don't feel the "difficulty of the Sichuan road," will be shocked that it is a geographical miracle.</p>
<p>Because it is a city built on mountains, the streets are all sloped, rugged, uneven, and it is really exhausting to walk! For people who grew up in the city, relying on their own footsteps to solve transportation problems is not only detrimental to the face of urban people, but also uneconomical in terms of time. However, geographical relations have determined Chongqing's fate. Not only can the latest streamlined cars not be transported from Kuimen for driving, but also the rickshaws pulled by manpower cannot run freely on the uneven streets. As a result, a large group of sedan chair carriers who ran from the countryside to the city to find food were born. In order to survive, they did not care about their sore muscles. They sold blood and sweat, carried people in sedan chairs to exchange for food, and solved this serious transportation problem for Chongqing.</p>
<p>The number of sedan chair carriers in Chongqing is just like the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai. These sedan chair carriers all come from the countryside. Most of them are hired farmers and tenant farmers in the countryside. The former works for the master (commonly known as long-term helper), and the average annual wage is only a hundred strings of cash. The higher wage earners, such as the so-called "senior long-term helper", are also only a hundred to two hundred strings of cash per year. Converted into Sichuan provincial currency, the annual income is only a few yuan to a mere ten yuan. If it is a single man, it can still be muddled through. If there is an unhappy wife at home, or if he is unfortunate enough to give birth to three sons and four daughters, then they rely on these few yuan to maintain the lives of several members of the whole family. If they don't starve to death, they have to sell a few of the scrawny children. Therefore, these hired farmers, under such tragic circumstances, cannot but try to find other ways to make a living. As a result, they went to the city in large groups. The latter is no different from the hired farmers. Most of them borrowed a hundred or ten strings of capital at high interest rates, rented a few pieces of dry land from the landlord, and planted some miscellaneous grains to maintain the lives of a few people in the family. If the year is good, the harvested grain, in addition to the landlord's rent, can barely cope. If they encounter a year of disaster, or the warlords start fighting, then they are finished! Their hopes pinned on those few pieces of dry land are completely shattered! Not only is there no hope of harvesting, but even planting is impossible! However, the landlord's rent is still to be paid. In their painful groans, they have no choice but to leave the countryside and slip into the city, each carrying a beautiful hope and joyful longing.</p>
<p>Because of the need, these sedan chair carriers occupied a very important position in Chongqing some time ago. They came from hundreds of farms, and they already had experience in carrying sliding poles. Moreover, some of them had strength. Therefore, after arriving in this mountain city, they all practiced an amazing skill of carrying sedan chairs. They have a copper-ribbed iron-boned waist, a pair of thick and strong arms, and a pair of flying legs that walk like the wind. The secret of carrying sedan chairs is the eight words "the waist should be hard, the legs should be soft." This means straightening the waist to maintain the stability of the sedan chair, and softening the legs to increase the speed of walking. When they walk on flat ground, the person sitting in the sedan chair feels as comfortable as sitting in a car slowly driving on an asphalt road. If it is uphill, that is a good opportunity for them to show their skills. The person in front tries to use both hands to drag the sedan chair from the shoulder to the back, and the person behind tries to raise both hands to support the sedan chair at the rear. In this way, even when climbing uphill, the sedan chair will maintain a considerable balance, and the person in the sedan chair only feels relaxed and ascending upwards, floating like riding the wind in the void. When going downhill, the former raises and the latter lifts, and the sedan chair just falls steadily downward, like being in a light balloon falling in the air. Only those who have experienced it can taste that kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>In the abyss, a cruel thought suddenly came to his mind, "Yes, kill myself! I have been working hard all day long, but I still can't get a full meal or a peaceful night's sleep!" His tears flowed down, and he glanced at his old mother and wife. In the corner of the wall, he saw his dazed children, looking at him with frightened eyes. Yes, their father was usually so majestic! But today he also cried as if they had suffered a little grievance in the past. They didn't know that their father was suffering a heartbreaking pain at this time.</p>
<p>But Li Cheng immediately had another thought come to his mind: "Yes! Suicide is the most undesirable act of a coward, no, it is the act of a shameless person. A young man will never be subdued by a bad environment, and he should have the responsibility to transform the environment. Yes, how could I have thought of such a shameless thought?" He wiped the tears flowing on his cheeks. He said to his old mother: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040), 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Wenxuan Searches the Nunnery"</p>
<p>Wenxuan, a loyal and righteous young lad,</p>
<p>Searches for his master at the nunnery, sad.</p>
<p>He looks everywhere, no trace he can find,</p>
<p>Tears stream down his face, leaving him blind.</p>
<p>He stumbles upon the Guanyin Pavilion,</p>
<p>Kneels on the prayer mat, begging for salvation.</p>
<p>"My master's gone, no news to share,</p>
<p>The mistress at home is in despair.</p>
<p>She scolds and beats me without reason,</p>
<p>Saying I'm foolish, beyond all season.</p>
<p>She gave me a deadline, again and again,</p>
<p>But I don't know where my master has been.</p>
<p>Today's the deadline, it's drawing near,</p>
<p>If my master doesn't return, I fear,</p>
<p>I'll be sent to court, to face the rod,</p>
<p>My death is nothing, blessed by God,</p>
<p>But pity the mistress, so anxious and frail,</p>
<p>Great compassionate Guanyin, who never fails,</p>
<p>Show mercy, save us from this plight,</p>
<p>Grant my master a vision, day or night,</p>
<p>Advise him to return to his wife,</p>
<p>To avoid discord, and end the strife.</p>
<p>Let me escape unjust suffering's sting,</p>
<p>And my name, with my master's, will sing.</p>
<p>By imperial decree, the nunnery will be adorned,</p>
<p>Wenxuan cries his heart out, forlorn,</p>
<p>His deep sorrow touches the heart,</p>
<p>Silently pitying the young boy's part.</p>
<p>She wants to appear, to offer aid,</p>
<p>But fears the nuns will be betrayed.</p>
<p>The taste of marriage she has not known,</p>
<p>In two or three days, he'll turn home alone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the boy won't face death's doom.</p>
<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang, Double Pearl Ball</p>
<p>Lin Ji (122), 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Gold and Beauty"</p>
<p>What moves the heart with ease?</p>
<p>Gold and beauty, if you please.</p>
<p>Gold can sway the common man's will,</p>
<p>A beauty's words, like an imperial skill.</p>
<p>See how many youths have fallen low,</p>
<p>For gold and beauty, this much we know.</p>
<p>Remember Xiang Yu, the hero bold,</p>
<p>At Wujiang, his story's told.</p>
<p>Reluctant to part from his beloved Yu Meiren,</p>
<p>Look at corrupt officials, vying for power within,</p>
<p>They crave gold, never ceasing,</p>
<p>Some brothers fight, their bond decreasing,</p>
<p>Some murder for wealth, their souls defiled,</p>
<p>Some turn against loved ones, love exiled,</p>
<p>Some couples are separated, lands apart,</p>
<p>Some lose conscience, a blackened heart,</p>
<p>Some lose virtue, sacrificing all,</p>
<p>Gold, you hold such power, causing our fall,</p>
<p>You incite evil, with supreme might,</p>
<p>Harming so many, day and night.</p>
<p>You invert right and wrong, with great force,</p>
<p>So gold can buy a beauty, of course.</p>
<p>See how beauties of old held magic sway,</p>
<p>Overturning kingdoms, leading astray.</p>
<p>Remember Tang Jieyuan in "Three Smiles,"</p>
<p>He gave up love for beauty's wiles.</p>
<p>In "Double Pearl Phoenix," Wen Bizheng sold his soul,</p>
<p>To the Heavenly Official's door, losing all control.</p>
<p>He didn't want to be a scholar, you see,</p>
<p>But a low-ranking servant, for all to glee.</p>
<p>Don't laugh, Wu, don't look down,</p>
<p>Who doesn't love beauty, in every town?</p>
<p>Beauty, you're hateful, abusing your power,</p>
<p>Only valuing silk robes, in every hour.</p>
<p>For you, siblings turn against each other,</p>
<p>For you, fathers and sons cause a bother.</p>
<p>I think, if you weren't in this world,</p>
<p>Thieves wouldn't run wild, their banners unfurled.</p>
<p>If you weren't in this world,</p>
<p>We could strengthen our bodies, make our nation world.</p>
<p>If you weren't in this world,</p>
<p>No more inheritance disputes, no lives hurled.</p>
<p>If you weren't in this world,</p>
<p>Families wouldn't revolt, their stories unfurled.</p>
<p>All because of gold's dazzling gleam,</p>
<p>All because of beauty's alluring dream.</p>
<p>See how most men desire beauty's lure,</p>
<p>And women crave gold, forever pure.</p>
<p>So they deceive and love, for gold and silver's gain,</p>
<p>How many heroes die, in endless pain?</p>
<p>Countless are born, for your sake,</p>
<p>To dominate, to manipulate, to break.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu, The Righteous Demon's Tale</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1120), 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening While Ill (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>Confined by illness, years drift by,</p>
<p>Wasting my body, and my heart sighs.</p>
<p>I recall the days of spring illness,</p>
<p>When tender branches, lacked nature's kindness.</p>
<p>How long ago, the cicadas sang, outside the pearl blinds,</p>
<p>In the green gauze window, coolness finds.</p>
<p>Osmanthus fragrance mixed with medicine's scent,</p>
<p>The phoenix tree's fall, autumn's sentiment.</p>
<p>Now, fallen leaves and cold winds bite,</p>
<p>I know the earth slumbers in the winter's night.</p>
<p>Time wasted in illness, a blurred scene,</p>
<p>Spring departs, winter turns, a fleeting mean.</p>
<p>By the lonely lamp, a slender shadow's stretch,</p>
<p>Medicine stove and tea pot, a constant sketch.</p>
<p>Sleepless nights, I toss and turn,</p>
<p>Deep thoughts linger, lessons I learn.</p>
<p>Bitter, sour, spicy, sweet, all in one,</p>
<p>Separation, joy, sorrow, my fate outrun.</p>
<p>Bitter indeed, illness never ceases,</p>
<p>Hateful indeed, medicine always increases.</p>
<p>Sad indeed, the moon doesn't shine, who will care,</p>
<p>Tragic indeed, merciless rain's despair.</p>
<p>Few hours of sleep, but keen perception,</p>
<p>Sinking deep, tears shed with reflection.</p>
<p>Now I say, don't think my body is weak,</p>
<p>Look at the world, its woes speak.</p>
<p>A minor illness, will pass with spring,</p>

<h3>The Descendant of the Qing Dynasty, Princess Deling, Plays a Character in "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" has long been known worldwide. MGM started filming it three years ago. They came to China to shoot funeral scenes and other Chinese folk customs. Later, because director George Hill committed suicide, it was shelved for a long time. Filming resumed a few months ago and is now in full swing. Now there is another eye-catching news item: the role of Lotus in the film is said to be played by Princess Deling. Although the contract has not been signed, it is a fact that the princess is auditioning. It is said that Princess Deling studied drama under the guidance of French actress Sarah Bernhardt, and also studied dance with American Ms. Duncan. This is news published in the Hollywood film magazine Cinema. The truth is yet to be confirmed, but if it becomes a reality, then this female role related to Chinese national dignity will be played by Deling.</p>
<p>Note: Sarah Bernhardt was a deceased famous French actress, whose reputation was probably even greater than that of Mei Lanfang in China. Ms. Sarah's performance in "La Dame aux Camélias" was once very popular. As for Ms. Duncan, she was a pioneer of classical dance in the United States and a proud student of Wagner, the founder of classical dance.</p>
<h3>"Little Men," Unanimously Recommended by European and American Newspapers</h3>
<p>Screening at the Cathay Theater starting tomorrow</p>
<p>"Little Men" is an immortal masterpiece by Ms. Alcott, praised alongside her "Little Women" and "Good Wives." It has now been adapted into a movie, starring an all-child cast from Hollywood, making it a rare treasure among American films in recent years. The film will be screened at the Cathay Theater starting tomorrow. Here are some excerpts of the excellent reviews of the film from famous European and American newspapers for the readers.</p>
<p>"Little Men will always touch your heart!"</p>
<p>"It is the most precious of American romance films!"</p>
<p>"Love, peace, moving, beautiful... Only Alcott's pen can richly render these."</p>
<p>"Popular with all... It can shock the world on the screen as well."</p>
<p>"It will make you smile knowingly... and make you yearn unconsciously."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly one of the big films of the year."</p>
<p>"It is the most lovable and glorious of Alcott's works."</p>
<p>Second Factory</p>
<p>"Hearts United in Life and Death" and "Qingming Season" to be filmed simultaneously</p>
<p>The Star Second Factory on Avenue Albert has been established for nearly a month, and the interior decoration of the studio has been completed. "Hearts United in Life and Death" and "Qingming Season" (starring Liming Hui) will be filmed simultaneously. "Hearts United in Life and Death" is currently catching up with Chen Boer's scenes. The male lead, Yuan Muzhi, has recently been studying the makeup of the prisoner in the play. Based on Muzhi's past makeup experience, there will definitely be many amazing contributions in this play.</p>
<p>First Factory</p>
<p>"Night Meeting" and "Eternal Smile" being filmed simultaneously</p>
<p>At the Maple Bridge General Factory, "A Begonia Red" has been completely filmed, and "Xiao Lingzi" is being edited. "Night Meeting" (directed by Li Pingqian) written by Yao Sufeng and "Eternal Smile" (directed by Wu Cun) written by Liu Na'ou are being worked on in a tense atmosphere at the same time. "Night Meeting" stars Gu Lanjun, Gong Jianong, etc. Gong Jianong plays a blind man in this film. "Eternal Smile" stars Hu Die.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>The "Spring Color" bi-weekly magazine published nine photos of Li Lili in a swimsuit in front and back, "sensual and beautiful", "only selling for eight cents".</p>
<p>It is said that in this year, "rumors" have become a bit "incomprehensible".</p>
<p>"A Begonia Red" writes a story that begins in the warlord era. There is a military governor from that era, and his "battle map" and photos of women he planned to "conquer" were actually compiled into a large album. At that time, the conversations among those military officers and bureaucrats mostly came from the ranks of women. "A Begonia Red" is a very interesting and very real exposure of a kind of corrupt and poisonous officialdom black screen.</p>
<p>Lan Ping starring in Cai Chusheng's new work "Wang Laowu", the conditions have been roughly agreed upon, and the contract can be signed within days.</p>
<p>The wolves needed in "Records of Cold Moon and Wolf Smoke" will be borrowed from zoos in various places.</p>
<p>The cast list for Yi Hua's new film "Guangling Tide" has been finalized. The leading actors are Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Kai Xuan, Zhu Fei, etc.</p>
<p>The inaugural issue of Shanghai Beach Semi-Monthly Magazine was published today. The content mainly focuses on drama and film, and other topics such as dance, opera, broadcasting, and children are also covered. The editor of the magazine, Liu Yawei, extremely welcomes "objective and rigorous discussions".</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan performed at the Hongri Swimming Pool yesterday. Her diving posture was excellent and attracted much attention.</p>
