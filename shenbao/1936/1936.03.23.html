<h3>農村生活叢談</h3>
<p>— 兪慶棠主編</p>
<p>無錫東南鄉農民的田賦負担　翁祖善</p>
<p>一，沒有搔着癢處</p>
<p>在農村經濟崩潰的過程中，「田賦」也盡了極大的破壊任務。從來一般學者大多集中於賦額多寡和附加稅等方面研究，他們的筆尖很少能够觸到「積弊甚深」的徵收制度，這是一個很大的錯誤。附加稅增加的速率固是可驚，但我們如果把農民的額外支出來一看，便會發現這「無形的附加稅」常超過有形的附加稅數倍！所以要瞭解苛徵暴歛的實况，除了觀察有形的數字以外，必得向徵收的方式和徵收的過程中去找尋。數年來我們聽到的無非是：「附稅重疊，民不堪命」，「人民感受痛苦之深，厥爲附稅，」「各省田賦附稅繁多……致農民痛苦萬分，」之類的言論。其實都沒有搔着癢處！</p>
<p>中國農民的素性是馴良的。他們現在雖然一年一年的瘦了，可是「上勿欠皇糧，下勿欠私債」的輕鬆還是在每一個農民的腦袋裏憧憬着。現在無錫的田賦附加稅已增加到正稅的一·六倍，他們還是「典質以償」，絕無怨言！惟有這「無形的附加稅」，沒有一定的數額，一任催徵吏的勒索，無法逃避！有一位靑年的農民曾經說過：「我想，吃了農民每畝五升米糧的「圖正」，總應當體恤我們窮苦人了。那知道他聯絡鄉長，無惡不作，連在完糧國課上也要大敲竹槓。這樣的貪得無厭，我們就是流盡了汗，滴盡了血，終身像牛馬一樣的工作着，也是供養不起他們！」這確是代表大多數被剝削者的呌喊。催徵吏的橫徵暴歛，實不容再加忽視！</p>
<p>二，一般的觀察</p>
<p>依我所知道——無錫果南鄉——不論「自對投櫃」或由圖正代完，額外的支出總是逃不掉的。應完錢糧多少的確數，要看了「由單」（通知書）才知道，而由單就在岡正手裏。往往一期田賦開征已經數月，而圖正的由單尙未發出。這在知書識字的地主，商人並不感到困難——可以自己到糧櫃上去抄數。但在一般農民則簡直毫無辦法，非百般央求圖正不可。普通，農民的錢糧都由圖正經手代完。或先期墊支，再向農民加倍收費。兇狠的圖正更是信口勒索，一無標準。由單固然不發，甚至串要也拿不到手。在誠樸的農民，以爲錢已付出，萬事皆了。又那要會想到一二年以後還要吃押追舊欠的官司？這一種「欠不在民，收不入官」的實例，多得不可以數計。除了「浮收」「揟串」以外，還有額外的需索也是很大。一年中支出不止一决，可以向農民勒索的也不祗圖正一人。照普通情形（農民雖然無力支付，但已視爲當然的標準），「區書」「圖正」，每年各向農民收取二决：稻熟時每畝收米一二升，麥熟時每畝收麥一二升。米麥價格低落的年份則改收現金，以不比米麥最高價格少收爲原則。至於兇狠的每畝收到五六升或祇收白米不收小麥的也時有所聞。在這裏更有二點可以注意：第一，所謂每畝每年收取米麥各一二升，並不是一個絕對數，大抵十畝以上的，奇零數不計，十畝以下的往往超過此數。而這裏不足十畝的農戶却有百分之六十三以上。第二，勒索的多少，以距離城鎭遠近爲比例。離城近，收得少。離城遠，收得多。市鎭上收得少，鄉村裏收得多。至於「窮鄉僻壤」或三家村裏，則「天高皇帝遠」更是「無法無天」了！</p>
<p>這是一般的觀察。</p>
<p>除了口頭的零星材料以外，我還作了一决簡單的調査。這决調査到有九個花戶，田地五十四畝五分。串面正附稅合計三十二元八角一分七厘（註一）實際支出法幣七十五元五角，糙米二石四斗八升，小麥一石八斗五升，折合法幣二十六元六角一分（註二）。合計一百零二元一角一分。實際支出相當於正稅八倍强，相當於正附稅三倍强。浮收額相當於附稅三倍半弱。下面就是幾個實際的例子：</p>
<p>在這個統計裏我們可以看到農民每畝的田賦支出是何等地可驚！然而政府的實際收得呢？</p>
<p>註一，無錫田畝有平田，圩田，　田等名目，科則以平田爲標準，每畝一·〇一六九元。其餘都不足一元。此五十餘畝中無平田，故每畝平均祇六角零二厘。</p>
<p>註二，本日市價糙米每擔七八元，今作七元算。小麥每擔七元元角，但收穫時祇四元五角，故今作五元算。</p>

<h3>靑海旅行記（續）　跳神的一幕</h3>
<p>一年二度的跳神，按例將要開始，隨着人潮擁到右面的廣場中。我們在殿前得到一個栽絨的坐位、這時塲中已無隙地。四週的觀衆，由軍隊拿了皮鞭指揮他們坐下，十幾個有照相機的攝影者，已經翻上了屋頂。內中也夾雜了幾個拿電影機的外國人</p>
<p>鼓鑼聲響亮起來了，人聲也靜了，廣場的中間來了四個跳舞的骷髏，接着又是滑稽的大頭和尚，兇惡的牛頭馬面，和玲瓏活潑的小鹿子。一幕一慕的跳舞，隨着鼓鑼的音律疾徐進退。最後的一幕，盤中端出一個糌粑的魔鬼，放在場中。牛魔王式的神道，在一陣在舞以後，就跪在魔鬼的面前，舉起右手的匕首，將盤中的魔鬼戮成數段，幾頭鹿神，就在分散糌粑的四圍，搖頭擺尾慶祝着勝利。這是一段西藏宗教的故事，斬除破壞宗教的魔鬼。他們每一個寺院的跳神，多有道樣大同小異的一幕。</p>
<p>當地的漢人，因此就附會着「斬年。年就淸初平西的年羹堯，他到塔爾寺斬了大喇嘛八人，就是現在葬在「小金瓦寺」前的八塔。寺中喇嘛，就世代的痛恨他。每年跳神，把他控成糌粑的魔鬼，而分尸數段，以作報復。所以魔鬼就代表年，這一幕跳神就稱」斬年。」</p>
<p>遊人多如鯽</p>
<p>在寺中祇見到滾滾的塵土，和人山人海的觀衆。據寺中德估計赴會得人總數在三萬人以上。其中十分之六十番人，十分之二蒙人，漢回也占十分之二，尚有七八個來看熱閙照相的外國人。今年因爲班禪大師駐蹕此地，蒙藏人民，朝聖陵，拜活佛，看燈會，一舉三便。有許多是阿拉善柴達木的蒙民，玉樹囊謙的藏民，他們都不遠千里而來，所以往年更形熱鬧。</p>
<p>他們的帳房，下滿了十里週圍的山溝中。狹小的山路上，塞滿了往來鯽的人頭。許多番士穿着緞子的新裝，背後拖着沉重的銀碗，頭飾，珊瑚貝壳琳琅滿身。拉着駱駝的蒙古人，很多點綴其間，使人引起異樣的情調。</p>
<p>從粵沙爾到塔爾寺，一條數里長得山路上兩旁下面張了賣買人的帳篷。蒙藏的人民在此地更擠得密不通風。攤子上的銅鐵器，布匹首飾，紅紅綠綠的花紙，熱氣騰騰的小吃，無不利市十倍。</p>
<p>十五的早上，我們上山去透透空氣，蒙藏的男女們數十成羣的已在山徑上禮拜，於塵埃寸積中撲得像泥苦菩薩一樣，這纔表示他　長頭的誠心。</p>
<p>今天班禪大師在大殿前誦經。三千五百個喇嘛，拍手擲足討論經典。如痴如在的觀衆，在數百步以外的石級前，朝着班禪的影子　頭，也有許多沒有見着影子而下跪的，還有千萬個力弱者，站在後面，他們的前額觸不到寺門口的蹬石，使他們虛此千百里遠來的誠意。</p>
<p>美麗酥油燈</p>
<p>今天的晚上，就中元宵的塔會，自有喇嘛教的地方，都推，爾寺的酥油燈，最為精巧華麗觸所以蒙藏人民，也都以前額一賞酥油燈架為榮。</p>
<p>酥油燈的製造，遠在半年以前，製造酥油燈的藝匠，領着寺中一千五百兀的酥油，靜坐在秘室中按造，此時禁止任何人的參觀。</p>
<p>元宵夕陽下山以後，他纔將偉大的酥油燈，供在綉有佛　的帳房—天棚—中，任人鑒，第一决參觀的是班禪大師，第二决纔輪到吾們，在黑暗中由二個喇嘛提了燈籠來響導我們前面開路的一位喇嘛，他用皮鞭在人叢中打開一條小路，直通到大金瓦寺的右面熄煌的燈光之下。</p>
<p>兩個大酥油燈分擺着東西兩個地點，像五彩浮雕式的牌樓，直聳到高的二丈的天棚頂上。下面點着一排明亮的酥油燈，照着牌樓中央一尊生動的佛像，佛像的兩旁叉佈置着亭台樓閣，樹木花草騎馬的人，散步的人，都在遊樂。佛頂上的一所亭子中，有四五個人在循環轉動，和走馬燈一樣。人物的衣服，花木的色調，鮮艷悅目，製工的精巧生動，全和眞的一樣，允其是在搖動的燈光底下，幾乎使人置身在巴黎臘人館中。最令人觸目驚心的，在華屋的上空，徘徊着一雙雙翼的轟炸機，地下又是一尊正在放射的開花大砲，這似乎象徵戰爭的頂兆。</p>
<p>人太擠了，我們忙着退出來，緊隨着嘛喇，繞着大金瓦寺，轉了一圈，一路供着的小酥油燈的地方共有七八盧，但是製工色調都很差了，大都祗有三角　的一塊花板，和一個二三尺高德佛像。看的人也沒有像前面的擠，誠心的老婆子，都在朝着牠叩頭。</p>
<p>明天會期過了，我們早上八點鐘，坐着原車回去。一路的帳房都在絡續的拔卸，人潮又各向歸途中擁去。</p>

<h3>識字運動的重要和推行（下）　教育部科長</h3>
<p>— 鐘靈秀</p>
<p>但是實行此項辦法，非政府下最大决心，用嚴厲强迫方法不可。同然其中有要重職務的人，不能個個有時間去敎人識字，我們可以想出其他的補救辦法，以替代之。是師資問題，也就不成多大問題了。至於識字課本，需要很多，有經費能印刷，固然很好。如果沒有經費，可由識字的人，每人抄寫三份，給他應該敎的不識字人。這樣，課本印刷費也可省却了。還可由敎育行政當局，令各級學校學生每人每學期抄寫幾份。有習字一門者，可拿習字時間改爲抄寫識字課本。以全國的大學生，專科學生，中等學校學生，高小學生，總計起來，每年必可抄寫數千萬份，這又是一個補救識字課本的辦法。此外推行識字敎育所需要之紙張筆壘，也可利用破舊紙筆和包裹物件的紙張，及各種廢棄的油印品的背面，把牠整理平正，就可做不識字者寫字算數的用紙。所謂「廢物利用」，想盡許多窮法子來補救，必定有許許多多可以利用的東西。如此說來，是校舍，師資，課本，紙筆等等都有相當的補救辦法，處處都可以節省經費，雖不能够全部節省，也可以節省一大部份，所以經費問題，也就不十分成問題了。那末，强迫識字敎育的辦法，只要政府下最大的决心，嚴厲督促，各方合力動員，實在可以雷厲風行的放膽做去，沒有十分困難的。</p>
<p>以上各項是積極的方法，此外尤應再用消極的方法來督促之，以濟强迫辦法之窮，茲分述於後：</p>
<p>十六歲以上，五十歲以下的不識字人，必須於限期內一律入附近民衆學校，識字學校，或其他識字處所，受識字敎育，違者處罰。</p>
<p>十六歲以上，五十歲以下不識字的人，必須於規定期限內，認識規定最低限度的字，如過期仍未認識規定應認議的字，須處罰之。</p>
<p>在各交通路口，城門口·車站·碼頭，設文盲査騐處，凡不能證明其已識字者，必須受檢騐，程度及格者通過，不及格者納「文盲捐」後，始准放行。</p>
<p>各機關·團體·工場·公司·銀行·商店等，僱用之人，必經考詢，不識字者，概不錄用。</p>
<p>識字限期已過以後，凡汽車夫，馬車夫，黃包車夫，査明不識字者，不發車證，不准駕車拉車。</p>
<p>圖書館，博物館，敎育館，體育場，公園，及其他游藝場所入門處，設識字檢查處，已識字者可自由出入，不識字者，須納「文盲捐」或買門票，始准入覽。</p>
<p>以上幾個積極的辦法，和幾個消極的辦法，如果雙方並用，效果必定大著。但恐遺漏的地方，自必很多，尙希熱心識字運動同志們多多補充，這裏不過略舉幾個例子。</p>
<p>近兩年來，各省市對於識字運動，積極推行，厲行强迫，成效卓著的很多。如上海市，靑島市，南京市，江蘇省，福建省，江西省，湖北省，安徽省等均極努力。最近的將來，必能依照計劃，一一實現，殊堪欽佩！現在國難嚴重，日深一日，無知無融的文盲，不但是不能够挽救國難，並且是萬不能立足於優勝劣敗之二十世紀的世界，我們應該抱定「三民主義政治下不容有文盲存在」的决心，努力從事，積極推行，希望全國同胞羣起注意，促其成功。</p>

<h3>点滴</h3>
<p>— （周旭升）</p>
<p>要使自己生活有意義有價值，那麼，就得去社幹會上不論大小只求切實需要的一切的事。</p>
<p>我們在正途上努力幹去，能用掉一分力量，就可以　　出一分經　來，所以成功的因素，便是一分一分的努力的總和。</p>
<p>被人欺侮的難受，總比不上自欺的險惡。</p>
<p>『世界是可詛咒的，但如果你對於世界僅是止於抱怨，那麼，最可詛咒的還是自己。』我們經過了上面幾句話的警惕，便應該如何努力自己對於世界所負的責任啊！</p>
<p>面對鏡子，就可以很清澈的看出自己容顏上面染有的汚點，可是社會的黑暗，事態的詭譎和人心的險詐，我們用什麼方法才可以把他透視個一明二白呢？</p>
<h3>從昭關到浣沙溪</h3>
<p>— 詹若耶</p>
<p>因了伍子胥的乞兵，在歷史上造成了一個轟轟烈烈，無人不曉的地方，這便是昭關。當伍員間關入吳時，路經歷陽，（即今和縣）乞飯於一浣紗女，女恥之，投溪而死，後人感其貞烈，，祠供祀。這便是現在的浣紗溪。</p>
<p>昭關在含山縣西門外，出城二十里即到，這來回四十里的路程，所賴以維持交通的，僅是幾匹驢子而已。昭關是夾在萬山之中，那氣象倒是非常壯嚴的，萬山重疊，僅這麼一個關口，周邊是什麼也沒有。也許是因為山勢比較高吧，相反的把一個昭關對比得那麼矮小，矮小而且黑暗，老遠望去，竟是還有點歪斜！看到這，恍如置身在一個中世紀的古城裏，一種懷古的幽情，－不，一種說不出來的情緒，縈繞在你的心門，這樣，可以使你更相信了古時所謂「丸泥可以封函關」的那一句話。</p>
<p>浣紗祠是在和縣，現在卻變成了一個尼姑菴，它的大名還不為當地人普遍的知道，其荒涼是可知了。當我懷熱烈的情緒，去探這古跡時候，卻給我懷着一份失望的心情回來了。讀者們可別用　蘿山下的若耶溪的幻想來讀這浣紗溪吧！原來所謂溪者，僅是一弘綠水，沒有樹，也沒有山，背景是一列土牆，數塊菜畦，如此而已。而它給予我的印象是空虛，這麼樣的一個地方，太辜負了這個美麗地含有穠郁的詩意的地名了。</p>

<p>先賢有兩句格言道：「一粥一飯，當思來處不易！」其實吃飯吃粥的大羣，畢竟有幾人真能體　到這兩句話的命意？說也難怪，豐衣足食的朋友，只知道「飯來張口」，「睡來閉眼」，誰還想什麼格言不格言？現在有兩個明證，卻不容你馬虎過去；萬頭　動的施粥廠，是要「先吃皮鞭後吃粥」的！一粒入口，實在不容易，不經一番拼命掙扎和管理施粥人員的努力維護秩序，休想分到一勺半瓢的米湯，先吃皮鞭後吃粥！卻非故意形容之詞，還有呢，便是「散飯」，這名詞雖然陌生，曾經在江輪上做過一兩回乘客，腦袋裏都會立刻反映到散飯的一幕；如行駛滬揚綫的小長江輪，所謂統艙乘客，迢迢數百里，票價不足法幣一元，包括乘客飯資，這雖不算什麼「施」，總可稱公司當軸嘉惠平民的半慈善方便之門吧，每到散飯，一雙毛竹筷，再給一隻粗瓷碗，那碗既非景德　，也不是宜興　，大約千百年後，可以選進博覽會咧；遠遠瞥見熱騰騰的黃米飯，由幾名下級輪役一籮一籮挾在腋下走出來，這一羣餓虎　鷹，莫不爭先恐後向前奪取，與其說散不如說搶了，這一陣劇烈騷動，當然勝過施粥廠的門前；一個個蹲着吞着，又防範着股下的小包　給偷了去，這種手足耳目並用的緊張空氣，大有十八位畫師寫不出的神態；像這糙米飯，在朱門之家，自然連　養的狗都不願下嚥，在他們卻可立盡數器，如食山珍海味；什麼東西佐飱呢？四枚銅元青菜，或是一碗綫粉油豆腐，這時候兒啼女呌，往往吵成一團，婦人們一面吃飯，一面哼着催眠曲，搖嬰孩入睡；什麼教人間地獄，這就是一幀縮影；伊們本來是要鑽進都會混口飯吃的，都會的破碎凋零，都會的捧不到飯碗，在沒有踏上都會的碼頭以前，卻先盡量地給了伊們一個暗示，這散飯搶飯的一幕，大概是象徵了都會的吃飯難吧。</p>

<p>第二十四回　利重美人輕傖夫割愛　志高雙足健壯士投荒</p>
<p>周有容插嘴笑道：那還不如我。心既結實，皮肉也結實，心結實，是不接受老百姓的哀告。皮肉結實，那是好經受皮鞭子。志前笑道：周縣長又發牢騷了。有容道：我若不是為了內人一個人在西安，我也跟了各位到西邊去。我的目的不同，只想到敦煌去看點東西。卓然笑着搖搖頭道：周縣長還是迷戀那石寶裏會出文字之室吧？若是還有石室文件，早也就弄得紙角都沒有了，還能等我們去搜羅嗎？不過談到敦煌縣，卻是一個有趣味的地方，那裏每一條街，是甘肅每一個縣名每一個縣名的街上，就住的那一縣的人，不但語言是那一縣的，而且婚嫁風俗，始終保持着那一縣的習慣。有容笑道：這倒奇了，為什那裏的居民，界限分得這樣的嚴哩？卓然道：敦煌向來是個邊縣，並無人民，那裏的人民，全是在甘肅各縣，調去駐防的。換句話說，那裏也就是甘肅縮小的一省。志前拍着手站起來道：我這回到新疆去，可以去看看了。卓然道：到迪化去，是不經過敦煌的。不過我們為了增加程先生的興趣起見，可以繞道到敦煌去看看的。志前越聽了這話，越是感到興奮，笑道：別人到西北來，都怕吃苦，但是我的理想不同，覺得是越能吃苦，越能增加興趣。但不知道二位決定那一天啟程？卓然道：因為沒有了日子了，所以特意來到周縣長這裏來，請程先生過來商量。我們打算明天上午就動身，不知道程先生可來得及！志前倒想不到行走得這樣子快，不覺口裏吸了兩口氣，現出躊躇的樣子，伸手摸了兩摸腰。石公道：假使程先生要展期一半天，也可以的。因為我們和平涼一個朋友，商量好了，在那裏會面。（四一八）</p>

<h3>日本的死刑</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本從前亦盛行殺頭和槍決的，現在大都採用絞決。大凡　盜殺人，放火殺人，叛逆罪者，都有處死刑的可能。在第一審判了死刑，自己懺悔而願意服罪，放棄上訴的，寥若晨星。大都要經數次上訴駁回而執行的。死囚在監獄裏，只要聽得看守者的腳音，便惴惴自危的問着今日是否執行死刑。看守者無論如何不肯對貪生的死囚說明執行的日期，一定要將死囚領到看守部長室裏，宣讀了「今日依據司法大臣的命令，執行死刑」之後，死囚方始知道死期已到。其時便很快的加了手銬，以防抵抗。平日自暴自棄的惡囚，此時便要神色大變，全身痤　着。</p>
<p>到絞首台的旁邊，那一個肯自己走上了，總是要幾個人強抱着。哭的，呌的，狂暴的，呼冤的，可說是人生最慘的一刹那了。唯有女囚除哭泣之外，少見暴亂的。絞頭台的傍邊設着為死囚祈禱的佛壇。佛前供着幾個饅頭和一杯茶，是供給死囚臨死時吃的。這個饅頭吃的人也有，但是兩隻手早已顫得不堪了，一杯茶終是潑翻了完結。</p>
<p>在執行死刑時神色自若的，要推前農商務省參事官的由田憲。他因為營米失敗，向放重利的借了錢，無法歸冋，便唆使兩個學生，用棒球棒把放債的打死，斬成數塊，用木匣裝着，丟在水裏。後來事情被洩，於是這農學士的農商務省高等官，便變成階下囚。當執行死刑的時候，神氣自若，吃了兩個饅頭，一杯茶，向看守的和執刑的道了謝，然後從容的登台。他的妹子知道刑期，送來了一件白色　衣，上面滿寫着「南無阿彌陀佛」。以為他就刑時穿着，可以減少苦痛的。</p>
<p>除了政治犯特別犯之外，死囚都是混住在一間屋子裏的，這是因為怕他自殺的關係。獨有名大米龍雲的囚犯，因為兇惡得搶人家的食物，於是獨自囚禁着。他是姦盜殺人放火的大盜，日本各地的女尼，被他淩辱的不知多少。他住在監裏，食不能飽，便迫着看守的去買麵包幹點，錢是沒有的，看守的沒有辦法，便得着他的同意，將他的死體，預先買給某大學，作為解剖的實　，得洋三十元。把自己將來的死體買掉，而供自己大嚼，恐怕要推日本的大米龍云為第一人了。</p>

<h3>詹詹錄</h3>
<p>— （章戈）</p>
<p>蔡元培先生曾說過：「現代青年應具三個基本條件：獅子樣的體力，猴子樣的敏捷，駱駝樣的精神。」大家都知道是很有價值的話。還有黃任之先生對於中國人需要的三個條件也有同等的價值，他說：，「中國要有俄國的精神，德國的科學，美國的財富，這三樣集合起來，中國不強而自強起來了」。</p>
<p>歷史上有二個姓馬的外國人，一個把我們中國比做天堂，一個卻把中國比做地獄，前者是馬可波羅的東方聞見記，後者是馬爾薩斯的中國人口現象。有人以為這二個人的主張太極端。其實我們把社會詳細觀察，就可見到一面是天堂，另一面是地獄。</p>
<h3>御廚豆腐</h3>
<p>— 蟄存</p>
<p>宋牧仲西陂類稿，載清聖祖南巡，恭紀蘇撫任內迎　盛事，某日有內臣頒賜食品，云宋犖是老臣，與眾巡撫不同，着F照將軍總督例一體頒賜。並傳旨云：朕有日用豆腐一品，味異尋常，因宋巡撫是有年紀的人，可令御廚太監，傳授於巡撫廚子，為後半世享用云。福建梁茞林中丞，曾附載奇聞隨筆，惜其法不傳於外，頗引為憾，後偶閱隨園食譜，載有八寶豆腐，亦清聖祖賜徐健安尚書方也。尚書取方時，御膳房去費一千兩，其法用嫩豆腐切碎塊，加香　屑，蔴菇屑，松子仁，瓜子仁，杏仁等屑，餘如雞肉屑，火腿屑，筍丁等，入濃雞汁中炒滾起鍋，食用瓢不用箸，令食之尤宜，當與賜宋牧仲之豆腐辦法無異也，予謂如此配搭烹調，任何食物，皆當鮮美適口，豈豆腐為然？亦可見從前專制帝王，玉食萬方之奢侈也。</p>

<p>省立學校的學生，學業不好，品行壞，年級低，甚至補習班的學生，徽章是終日不離，至於學業好，品行優良，年級高的學生，徽章是不掛的。</p>
<p>甚至社會上沒有學問，沒涵養的人，愈說得天花亂墜，鬼神失色，至於有學問有涵養的人，決不多說話·</p>

<h3>小男兒（二）（〇）（八）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>其時馬先生正走過來，便站住了脚，说幾句安慰鼓勵的話，「親愛的，你已是盡你的心以促進那種好境界。繼續維持你的信心，你的努力，求你小試騐的成功，證明它不是不，」這好人從沒有失去他對於人類的篤信，依舊希望見到和平，善意，和快樂能充沛於大地之上。</p>
<p>「父親，我郤沒有那麽奢望。我但願給這些孩子們一個家庭，在這裏他們可以學習到幾種單純的性質，這樣，當他們投身到茫茫人寰裏，去打出他們自己的生路時，他們的困苦，容可减少一些。誠實，勇敢，勤勞，對於天，對於人，和對於自己的篤信；我所努力以求的，便在這裏罷了。</p>
<p>『這本來是一切的一切了。給他們這些帮助，然後讓他們去經營獨立而榮譽的一生；不管他們遇到何種成功或失路，我想他們總會記得和祝福你們的努力的，我的好女婿和好女兒。」</p>
<p>這時那敎授已經加入了他們的一集團；當馬先生說話時，他伸出兩手，一手給他女婿，一手給他的女兒，並且向他們一看，他們便覺有無上的安慰。後來蜀和她的丈夫並立一晌，安安靜靜談着，自覺他們的「夏耘」，旣然得到了那位聰明長者的贊許，必然是很好的</p>

<h3>蘇聯經濟政策的趨向</h3>
<p>— 為元</p>
<p>蘇聯經濟政策已經過幾種不同的方法，大概說來，可以分為四個時期，第一·一九一七年至一九二一年為軍事共產主義時，第二一九二一年至一九二八年為新經濟政策時期，第三。第一個五年計畫時期，第四，就是目前的第二個五年計畫時期。</p>
<p>在第一個時期的時候　蘇聯政府企圖統制國內完全的經濟生活，道雖然不能隨時隨地的見諸實行，可是在這時期中確乎是蘇聯政府統治中重要的動機。</p>
<p>第二個時期　就是新經濟政策時期和第一個時期不同的地方，在於廢棄第一時期所行的國家經濟統制中專賣的原則。新經濟政策是一種雙重制度，政府一方面保留對於幾乎各種重工業的統制，實際上全部的信用制度，國際貿易及運輸等也在統制之列，另一方面許可農民耕種自己的田地和自由的交易。</p>
<p>第三時期　政府壟斷各種生產品及貿易，對於農業，允為注意。以個人為基礎的個農制取銷，而代以集團制市場上出賣農產物是被禁止的。價格一定不易。消費嚴加限制。政府統管全國的生產和分配，當局以一定的價格得到巨量的穀類及他農產物。就這一點看來，當局是成功的。可是以當局想增加或改進農產品一點說來，並無成效，一因在集團農場中不准有私產，一因農民須將剩餘以低廉定價出售。更有一點，就是當局無法消滅那些不合法的自由市場，因為在自由市場裏的價格比較政府所定的水準高得好幾倍。</p>
<p>第四時期的特點　就是政府賦予農民的的特許。農民一旦依照五年計劃所規定的部份交付給國府之後，政府特許他們可以將剩餘的貨物以高價出售於自由市場。道樣，多少可以補償他們因按定價出售而遭的損失。自一九三三年一月起，當集團農產特准貿易的時候，自由市場除了幾種限制外，叉成為合法的了從那時起，除國家定糧機關以低廉的定價將產物分銷給工人及雇員而外，同時國家及合作商店以遠超統制度價的貿易也有着並行的發展。因此物價制度當然日趨混亂。蘇聯盧布不足為價値均一的標準牠的購買力也因各地員情的不同而互異，虛薪金的水準已不能誘掖工人們增加生產。並而，政府以過去經騐，已深知普遍的分配統制非但很不經濟，而且很不易處理的。政府方面也明白；統制供應對於農業發展上以及消費最多貨物的改良上都是有妨碍的，因上述種種原因，蘇聯政府自一九三五年一月起廢止定價統制供應和定糧卡制度，而創一貨一價的水準。</p>
<p>第一次五年計聲期中。還有一個基本原則，——就是農業「全體」集團化，蘇聯政府也有重行考量的必要。後來，在集團制中准許幾種私農場。一九三五年二月新法規定「集團農場所用之果田，除房屋所佔之地外，得佔四分之一公頃至二分之一公頃，地區異常者，得佔一公頃」：「五穀，棉，糖蘿葡，亞麻，大麻，馬鈴　及蔬菜等種植區域之每集合農場得畜為己用：母牛一頭，小牛二頭，牝豚一頭，及其幼畜，——如果集團農場的管理部認為　豚一頭不足，得畜二頭及其幼畜，——綿羊及山羊不得多過十頭，母鷄及兎頭數不限及蜂房數不為過二十」，有飼養牲畜業的農業區國裏，每集團農場得畜為己用：母牛二三頭及二三頭以上之家畜，在遊牧區域，集團農塲得畜為己用：母牛八頭至十頭，綿羊及山羊共一百頭至一百五十頭，母鷄頭數不限，馬不得過十頭，駱駝五頭至六頭。如此，在集團制度中，私農場的存在已被認為合法，集中農場中的私人利益也受着鼓勵。結果，農產物普遍的增加也得到相當的成效。</p>
<p>本期中還有一個特點　就是蘇聯政府不以法合規定最大生產額，這種方法在第一次五年計劃的時候是經採用過的。五年計劃各部的完成雖有不同，而預定的估計却年復一年地增加，結果因了工人和技士的技術關係，要想强行過量的生產，生產的標準上不免遭到惡劣的影響。這個錯誤是蘇聯當局所承認的。現在注意到產品的質量的提高，把量的要求减至適中。如果這句話是對的，那末一九三五年計劃所需的量，當比一九三四年的少，一九三五年計劃中，一九三五年的計劃，巳顧到國內工業的實力，而不專以增加產量為能事。道樣，這計畫各部完成較為均勻。現在工業和農業產品，在質的方面，都有進步，當局對於手工及技術人員的態度，也已改變。新法規定的工資標準，細工和粗工有着顯著的差別。</p>
<p>這些新的趨向，在蘇聯國內經濟政策及國營的各種事業上，都是很明顯的，——普通學校和大學的改組，憲法的修改，籍以將選舉制度變為民主化，在手工和腦力工作的酬勞上，的估計，並把國營和私人實業聯在一起。</p>
<p>現在的經濟制度下，除了集團農場內外的私農場外，都是由國營或國家管理機關來辦的，而在新經濟政策制度下，只有那與軍事有關的經濟事業是由國家直接管理。</p>
<p>這次蘇聯經濟政策變遷，是件很重要的事情，蘇聯企圖一方面助長私人事業，一方面實施國家經濟統制，將來能發展至若何程度，現在無法預霄，不過這企圖的本身無疑地是眞着遠大性的。</p>
<h3>斯泰哈諾夫運動下蘇聯產業之動向</h3>
<p>— 何氷</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>關於蘇聯斯泰哈諾夫運動，國內曾有幾次介紹過，但這運動在蘇聯所已發生的實際效力如何，則尙少有人提到。這運動可說是蘇聯第二次五年計劃的最重要特微，也是蘇聯社會主義經濟建設更進一步的表現，這運動不僅已燃燒起蘇聯全國靑年男女熱血，就見在先進的資本主義的國家，對於使生產效率提到當時可能的技術最高標準這一點上，也沒有不驚異的</p>
<p>什麽是斯泰哈諾夫運動，便是產業效率的增進。斯泰哈諾夫本是蘇聯「簡單的說獨叭斯礦區」之「路爾煤礦」中的一個普通煤坑夫，但突然間變成了世界聞名的，被稱為「勞動的雄」「英歷史的人物」去年十一月十四日起，莫科斯特為舉行盛大的斯泰哈諾夫運動大會，根據斯泰哈諾夫運動的始祖斯泰哈諾夫本人的報告這運動的發生，是在他所工作的煤礦中工作的效率極慢，他及他同志，早想設法改進，終於在去年九月一日，他在煤礦六小時中採掘了百零二噸煤，到九月九日，增加到了百七十五噸，堆滿了十一架貨車，產生了世界的記錄。這鑛區中本來每一勞動者的採掘量，平均祇六至七噸，而斯泰哈諾夫一人超出了「二十五人」的勞動效率。</p>
<p>現在，蘇聯的執政者已把斯泰哈諾夫運動推廣於全部　　　部門外，甚且已普及於軍備，文化等領域，斯泰哈諾夫運動成為促進蘇聯全部社會主義建設的槓杆。本來蘇聯對於改進生產技術，增加勞動率的運動，很早就發生，一九一九年李寗曾說「在最後的意義上，使新社會機構得以勝的，勞動生產效率實是最重要的問題。資本主義曾創造了在奴隸時代未曾見過的勞動生產效率，同樣因社會主義創造較新較高度的勞動生產效率，所以能把資本主義敵底的克服」。在第一决五年計劃時代，蘇聯提出了「爭取新的技術」，「技術足以解决一切」的口號，為使自農業國向工業國轉變，發起了廣大的「突擊隊」雲動，吸引無數的產　工人為突擊隊員，充分的灌輸其技術智識，如以突擊隊運動為容一决五年計劃之代表特徵的話，則斯泰哈諾夫運動即為第二次五年計劃的代表特徵，在其成效與影響上，自然是比突擊隊運動再進一步，不過，斯泰哈諾夫的成功，自以過去的建設為基礎的，如斯泰林所說，在突擊隊運動時，工人多沒有技術的智識，所以非常困難，但現在，體力勞動與精神勞動之間，雖仍有鴻溝，但有技術智識的靑年工人，却已很普及了。</p>
<p>一切遝動的發生，都具有實際需要，這是一定的。斯泰哈諾夫運動之所以能在蘇聯成功，拋開其他條件不說，就是蘇聯目前產業——尤其是重工業，在技術上改進的需要，實是童大的原因之一，反之，雖則是工業先進的國家，如英美，在這一切生產過剩的時候，原有技術尙在低落，新技術不但不會發生，就要是需也是很少的。</p>
<p>原來，蘇聯自革命以後，產業雖有突飛的進步，但因原先究竟是落後的農業國家，在若干的工業部門，仍不能有預定的那樣發展。第二决五年計劃中，最使蘇聯當局感到困難的，是有幾個主要的重工業部門，頗形不振，如　問題不能克服，蘇聯的危機是極大的。</p>
<p>一九三五年，是蘇聯第二次五年計劃的第三年度，年來各重工業雖續有進步，但較之原定的計劃相去還是距離很大，如以製鐵，採煤及石油來說，則製鐵業在一九三五年度預定的製鐵計劃是：</p>
<p>生鐵一千二百五十十萬公斤</p>
<p>鋼鐵一千二百萬公斤</p>
<p>延鐵八百五十萬公斤</p>
<p>但到去年六月末，生鐵的生產額是六百萬四千公斤，祇達到計劃的百分之四八，反而不及一九三四年度一千萬公斤的成績，鋼鐵生產額在同期不到六百萬公斤比之生鐵更為不及。延鐵也一樣沒有達到預定目的。</p>
<p>一九三五年預定的採煤計劃是一億二百二十萬公斤，在去年上半期生產額計四千九百七十八萬公斤，相當於這年計劃的百分之四五。五，七月八月九月，以下也沒有完成預定計劃，蘇聯重工業中採煤業的不振，是很顯著的，去年八月，蘇聯政府曾發出警吿「蘇聯燃料不足，對於國民經濟打擊極大，採煤業的不振，應即為解决。」</p>
<p>蘇聯對於石油業，在組織上及在技術上，曾費了許多的改善努力，所以年來日見進步，在一九三四年，蘇聯的石油業已佔到世界第二位，僅决於美國，但依照蘇聯預定計劃及國內情形言，則相去仍遠，一九三四年度石油生產達到預定計劃的百分之八八·八，如依其儲藏量來說，其數量實過微，（蘇聯全國石油資源儲藏量佔全世界百分之三二，的三十十億餘公斤。）一九三五年預定採油三千三十三萬公斤，（石油及瓦斯均在內），實際上並沒有達到，允其蘇聯有名的「格羅示奴伊」油田，出產額反而减少。</p>
<p>在這樣的塲合，如何發展這些重工業，自為蘇聯當局所焦心竭慮，一見斯泰哈諾夫的成功，自必利用之作盛大的運動，以推行於各產業部門。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>斯泰哈諾夫運動給予了蘇聯各產業部門以如何的影響呢？一般地說，就祗到今日，已有若干部門，生產額比較以前已增加了三倍至五倍。允其是在斯泰哈諾夫運動發祥地的採煤業，成績更為顯著。烏奥羅西羅夫煤田及斯烏愛爾獨羅夫斯庫煤田，成績特佳，在去年十一月末，把去年度的計劃完全完成。即烏奥羅西羅夫煤田於十一月末，生產額達到預計的百分之一零四·七，斯烏愛爾獨羅夫斯庫煤田也達百分之一零零。二。在其他產業部門中，生產効力之世界紀錄也續有發生，據蘇聯有名的技術家庫拉索夫斯塞的計算，自從開始斯泰哈諾夫運動以來，重工業的勞動生產効率一般地已增加了百分之一六·三，這數字是很可驚人的。</p>
<p>茲先把斯泰哈諾夫運動影響下，各重工業部鬥技術的改進情形略為一述。</p>
<p>（一）製鐵業如上述，蘇聯製鐵業本不振，但自斯泰哈諾夫運動發生後，到去年十二月，蘇聯全國一日的生產類，已有；</p>
<p>鋼鐵四〇，〇〇〇公斤</p>
<p>生鐵三八，五〇〇公斤</p>
<p>的規定，鋼鐵超過了生鐵。製鐵部門技術的改進更是銳意進行，據蘇聯報紙所載：</p>
<p>「鎔鑛爐」的利用，即以美國最優秀的製鐵工場來比較，在哈巴工場（第三號爐）利用鎔礦爐的佔百分之〇·九一三，阿利契巴工場（第四號爐）佔百分之〇·九八，路肖工場工第一號爐）百分之〇·九三，而在蘇聯呢，在默契愛夫工場佔有百分之八七。與美國最優秀的工場相較，雖尙形不如，而其改進之速，已可驚人</p>
<p>用默爾胎爐，在美國大概可製一平方米的鋼五·五噸，但在蘇聯，用同一爐，出產五·〇二—五·二四噸，已很普遍，有的可出六噸，最優秀的斯泰哈諾夫式工塲，且可出八—十二噸。</p>
<p>（二）採煤業本業在去年度上半期很不振，但自下半期來，即吿恢復，在去年十一月末，蘇聯全國生產成績達到預定的百分之九三·五，未到達的已很少。而在斯泰哈諾夫發祥地路爾煤田，成績更驚人，每一架採煤機平均可採十七噸，而英國的最高不過十一噸。每一交班時間平均可出炭六十噸，美國的最高記錄為之打破。</p>
<p>（三）石油業蘇聯的石油業雖有顯著的進展，但仍有許多缺點存在，對於預定計劃的完成，因之妨碍頗甚。即許多缺陷中，主要的是鑿井設備的不充分，所以，去年石油計劃中的重要部份，即為鑿井計劃。蘇聯鑿井技術的水準比較美國為低，這種鑿井計劃將為今後擴大生產的基本前提條件。但是，這僅就一般而言，在斯泰哈諾夫式的採油部門，其成績之優秀，又當別論，特別是在默伊內夫挈地方，尼契淸技師的鑿井速度，竟至突破了美國的記錄。一九三四年美國油田平均鑿井速度，一個月內每一機器的四百十二米，而尼契淸技師却高至一千二百四十三米，只要一看這樣高的數字，還不能和美國最高的記錄相匹敵嗎？因之，蘇聯近年來　　的速度，有如下之增加！</p>
<p>一九三二年七四三（千米）</p>
<p>一九三三年八三八</p>
<p>一九三四年一、二四〇</p>
<p>一九三五年（計劃）一、六〇〇，然與美國在這一年內　井規模自一千萬米至一千五百萬米相較，則蘇聯計劃中的一百六十</p>
<p>（四）機械工業除上述三種工業以外，在</p>
<p>（A）自動車工業中，高　基自動車工塲的薩烏伊契愛夫（人名）在一小時內，可製八十三獨自動車工塲，這比之蘇聯生產速度最高的夫　倍</p>
<p>（B）這還不是最高的，夫奥獨工場中有柯拉珂者，每小時可製一百十八個機件，而高函基工場的獨拉金，每小時可製一百四十個。</p>
<p>（C）用迴轉削斷機製造汽筒蓋，在德國，一小時內製造五十個，但在蘇聯的奥路琪尼契粹工場中，郭獨夫應用德國製的「烏愛爾內爾」機，一小時內可製一千四百三十個，這是多少驚人的數目：</p>
<p>（D）氣熔接的世界最高記錄為九十三米，而在蘇聯的契洛夫工場中，每一交替時間中有一百二十六咪。</p>
<p>其他類似的情形，在蘇聯報紙上幾乎每日都有發見，雖則斯泰哈諾夫運動的成効，究到了怎樣程度，現在還不能說，但蘇聯今日的重工業，比第一次五年計劃所完成的，已進展了極多，那是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>（五）輕工業斯泰哈諾夫運動在輕工業方面的作用，也和在重工業方面同樣，到一九三五年，可說在輕工業上的各種落後因素，為之一掃而空。到一九三五年初為止，輕工業達到了這年預定計劃的百分之一〇二·四，依照鐵道運輸，這是蘇聯經濟部門中最發達的一種。其中，允其是食料品，如把一九三五年與一九三四年同期比較，各業均有如下的增加；</p>
<p>肉類七九、四（千噸）</p>
<p>腸結類五二、三（田）</p>
<p>魚類一六四（問）</p>
<p>薩勒砂糖三四九、六（同）</p>
<p>角砂糖二二四、七（同）</p>
<p>植物性油五三（同）</p>
<p>動物性油一一、二（同）</p>
<p>獸乳製品三七（同）</p>
<p>菓子類四八、四（同）</p>
<p>罐結類一八六、四（百萬罐）</p>
<p>澱粉製品二三、二（千噸）</p>
<p>飮料品二、〇八五（千Decalire）</p>
<p>紙烟六〇（一億技）</p>
<p>烟斗用烟草，八二二（千袋）</p>
<p>麻油六、九（千噸）</p>
<p>（惟火酒减少了九十四萬四千Decalire）</p>
<p>輕工業的發展，是第二决五年計劃的重要部門，在一九三四年，僅完全預定計劃的百分之九五·六，到一九三五年，因原料生產豐富，國民生活也豐裕起來，蘇聯政府因之决定增加生產百分之二—二〇，因之，在去年十二月初，即完成了預定計劃的百分之一〇二·四。此外，蘇聯對於織物開始大量生產，生產額的增加，隨之更多：</p>
<p>棉織品二六億六八〇〇萬米</p>
<p>毛織品七〇〇〇萬米</p>
<p>亞麻織品二億三〇〇〇萬米</p>
<p>絲織品二億八〇〇〇萬米</p>
<p>此外，鐘錶，留聲機等文化用具的生產，也有顯著的增加，輕工業與人民生活最有關係，輕工業的發展，也是蘇聯國民生活向上的表示，斯泰哈諾夫運動對於輕工業技術的改進，影響也極大，例如在斯泰哈諾夫運動第一决大會時，據烏伊諾庫勒督活女士的報吿，她在一年前僅管十六座到二十六座織機，現在她可以管理一百四十四座織機。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>現在，再來看一下蘇俄一般的產業進展狀况及其在世界的地位。作為一切工業之基礎，又在各帝國主義包圍下，必須發展軍需工業的前提下，蘇聯自然重視重工業，允其鋼鐵工業的發展。在蘇聯本國預定的計劃內，鋼鐵工業的發展，並沒有達到預期的程度，但與各資木主義國家比較，允其是在過去經濟恐慌，生產激遽减少的幾年中，蘇聯在這方面的進展是非常大的。如以生鐵生產的速度來說，各資本主義國家述到其今日的狀况，平均需時五十八年，而蘇聯則不過十年間：</p>
<p>生鐵生產擴大的速度（蘇聯與其他資本主義國家的比較）</p>
<p>資本主義諸國</p>
<p>再就實際的生產數來說，蘇聯鋼鐵生產的發展很快，如在一九二九年退到一九三五年上半年計止，所佔比率是自百分之四·六，累增至百分之二一·七，鋼鐵則自百分之四·三，累增到百分之一四·六，這種擴大，對於蘇聯全部產業的發展，影響是極大的。</p>
<p>一九三五年是第二次五年計劃的第三年度以全部工業來說，在一九三五年的上半期，完成了預定計劃的約百分之四八·九，比之前年同期的四六·一，成績見增加了的。其中，作為蘇聯經濟之基軸的重工業，成績最好，在一九三五年，有許多部門，比之一九三四年超越許多，成績比較差一些的，為燃料工業，各部門各別情形，如下表！</p>
<p>重工業各部門照預定計劃所完成的百分數，</p>
<p>就是蘇聯政府自己也承認，在各種工業中，以重工業發展的速度為最快，如下表所示！</p>
<p>如上表，可見二。及二。以下各部門增加的速度，均不及。一。為快，國家重要性工業，生產手段的生產工業，及重工業發展很大。但這祇就比率上來說，自第二决五年計劃開始後，消費品生產的絕對數也已激遽發展，生活品不足之聲，早已沒有，所以在單獨方面說，消費品生產的增加也是一樣的快。</p>
<p>這還僅就一九三五年的上半期而言，斯泰哈諾夫運動的發展，盛於下半期，因材料不足，雖因這裏尙還不能舉出具體數字，然如上節所述，必然超越上半期，那是沒有疑問的。</p>

<p>康健之路</p>
<h3>食慾不可忽視</h3>
<p>— 黎福民</p>
<p>胃臟欲其嬌弱則易，欲其强健殊難，胃健者食必多，消化佳良，精神飽滿，然遇事操勞，用腦過甚，必食慾减退，而致慢性胃病，喪失健康。住杜美路何錦帆君，勞心食减，見飯生厭，噯氣泛酸，食後脹悶隱痛，迭治莫瘳，便秘　瘦，精神不振，日就衰弱，後投余處求治，經囑服「强胃精」，改造其胃梭能，以昂盛食慾，果獲良效，食量大增，精神煥發，大便通暢，日前得其來書，謂自服二藥月許，三年夙息，一旦霍然，生機重萌，身體復健，每値宴會，狼呑虎嚥，四座為驚！前後宛若兩人云</p>
<h3>性神衰弱治騐珍聞</h3>
<p>— 南昌陳訓慈來稿</p>
<p>久婚新姙</p>
<p>余友孫伯華君，成婚十年，迄未有孕，嗣知孫君於發育時代，誤犯手淫，致罹性神經襄弱，先為遺精，滑精，結婚後，病勢更迫，發有陰莖不能勃起之趨勢。精液冷薄，以致夫婦感情冰炭，嗣由其滬上友人寄贈德國梅倫博幾明之「補體康」二瓶，孫君服完後，病勢巳去其半，乃往南昌中華大藥房續購半打，服後筋肉充實，遺精滑精等病，皆完全治愈，而乾道强壯，夫婦感情因以融洽，有逾新婚。前日余因事赴孫君之家，見其优儷壯健逾恒，孫君並報吿自己病情，與服「補體康」之經過如是。又謂今日內子懷孕，皆受「補體康」之賜云。</p>
<h3>鄧源和醫師肺病臨床實騐錄</h3>
<p>血痰欬嗽遺精盡瘳</p>
<p>患者金祖耀君，廿六歲，學界。病　—結婚過早，房勞斵喪，遂起咯血。病狀—胸脇刺痛，咳嗆多痰，　夾血點，氣息短促，日暮體溫增高，　骨潮紅，失眠遺精，神情萎靡，各藥　效，四年以來，身虧體削。嗣由友人繆　永君介紹至余處診治。處方—診斷左肺有空洞，右肺尖結核點密佈，即對症投藥，囑購服德國「補肺拿爾」凝血補肺，而除欬痰；一方面並令服德國「補體康」以治遺精失眠。的兩星期，血痰消失，欬止食增，夜眠安枕，精固神足，恐其再發，乃堅囑其續服三星期，以保斷根，日前忽得其來書，謂因二藥對症，故為期匝月，身體迅復壯健，體重銳增，不啻重慶更生云</p>
<p>欬嗆痰唾央婦並救</p>
<p>患者章雪丹君，年卅二歲，商界。病歷—早歲傷於手淫，叉復操勞過度，時發單聲欬。病狀個痰唾白沫，胸時隱痛，欬嗽雖少，而氣息促迫，食慾减退，失眠盜汗，遺精陽萎，體大虧憊，不可支持，藥治殆通，終鮮確效。直至去春始來余所求診。處方—X光檢肺，病至三期，非普通藥物所能奏效，急囑服德國「補肺拿爾」壯補肺臟，則欽痰必瘳；同時囑兼服「補體康」，則失眠自愈，遺精告痊。遵服月餘，果獲良效。其夫人亦夙患欬症，月事不正，乃囑依法服用「補肺拿爾一，並合服德國「補女容」以調經，卽臻全治。上週彼表娃來診療，述及章君夫婦自經此决根治後，身壯體健，雖工作操勞，而精神彌佳，且章夫人上月已喜獲弄璋云。</p>
<h3>莫斯科各醫院治淋統計</h3>
<p>歷來各國對於淋藥之研究，可謂彈精竭慮，不遺餘力，而終未能創製一功效確切之良劑，以故夙有淋菌猛於虎之喩，然近年因科學進步，卒有德國淋病聖藥「克淋儂」之發明，於是打倒一切淋藥，而學者亦盡棄其研究之業，一致擁護此並世無兩之名劑！泰西各國，無論醫　或男女病家，莫不習用「克淋但」，因之淋病患者减少百分之八十三。卽以蘇聯論：查彼邦對於外藥進口，素極嚴格，惟一克淋儂」則提倡彌力，且完全　免進口稅，蓋因其藥性王道，效力至是騰人故也。惟須確切認明「克淋儂」三字！據莫斯科各醫院精密統計：服此藥三四瓶，迅獲徹底全治者，竟達百分之九十八以上！閶有不能治愈者，則係因在治癢期間，不聽醫師吩咐，擅自　酒勞作，不愼攝生，故預後不甚佳良，實則若能服此藥愼加調治，未有不全臻根斷者，此徵諸已治愈之人雖房事酣飮，從不復發之事實即可證明。噫！今而後，淋病難治之論，將從此推翻矣！</p>
<h3>兩性發育不全問題</h3>
<p>— 包致平醫師</p>
<p>吾人對於性的發育，多不注意，大抵在靑年時代，因缺乏性智識，所以多犯手淫自凟之惡癖，致正待發育之靑春腺，遂橫被摧殘，於是男性則有身體矮小，生殖器發育不全，遺精，早洩，腎虧，生殖力勃起不充分，女性則月經遲至，白帶頻來，身體肥矮或消瘦，其兩性相同之症狀，則有艷夢，失眠，頭昏，目眩，腰膝酸痛，精神恍惚，作事無恒，記憶力薄弱等。凡發育不全之男女，皆為不姙之主因。</p>
<p>德國生殖學家梅倫博士，為解决兩性發育不全之難題起見，竭數十年之心血，發明男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，二藥係擷取靑春旺盛期之雌雄兩性動物，如獅虎猩猩海狗等睪丸及卵巢荷爾蒙，分別製成，（男用雄性動物，女用雌性動物）服此藥後，能於二三星期內，改造生殖系之組織，使兩性發育達於正常，前述諸症，因以排除，不姙者卽姙。如女子有白帶者，「補女容」與「卡而雪地氏陰道片」同用，功效允偉云。</p>
<h3>德國淋病特效藥　克淋儂實騐寫眞</h3>
<p>— 盛在强</p>
<p>（一）急性淋之急治法</p>
<p>患者沈華鍾君，年廿五歲，住老北門。某夕為友戲弄，卽感淋病，旋尿道卽作刺痛，泌出茶綠色之分泌物，內混有血球甚多，龜頭腫大，包皮翻轉，尿意急促，但排尿時又十分困難，致少腹會陰等處，有脹悶鈍痛之感，夜閒起疼痛性之射精，幸沈君頗富醫學常識，知此為念性淋，卽投余處乞爲治療，余以沈君之病，必須內服消炎殺菌之藥，始能遏止病勢，卽囑其內服德國治淋名藥「克淋儂」，以消炎殺菌，通暢小便，使菌毒從小便內排除，的二星期後，尿蝪痛止炎消，續服一星期而全愈。沈君雅好體育，聞自此病愈後，仍從事訓練體育不倦，從未復發云。</p>
<p>（二）夫妻白濁</p>
<p>患者何受福君，患淋病後，機以遺精，故身體十分羸弱，每在疲勞後，精液汨汨而出，且雜有血點，尿亦溷濁異常，蓋淋毒性精囊炎與滑精併發症也。乃投以「克淋儂」及「補體康」，前後服用五星期而全愈，經用血淸檢查，絕無淋菌踪跡，保證斷根，但何君夫人，亦患白濁多年，臘道紅腫，陰鬥腐爛，乞余介紹良藥，遂囑其內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以除膣道炎腫，陰門腐爛，四星期，膣道與陰門部分病灶，完全治愈，平復如初，淋病亦根治矣。何君夫婦久艱嗣育，自此病治愈後，即懷孕矣。</p>
<h3>老年哮喘症</h3>
<p>— 戴德</p>
<p>哮喘症，恒發於中年以上之人，咳痰氣急，煩苦最甚，往往陷於心臟麻　而死，故急宜根治。據余臨症實騐，　具除咳化痰，平氣定喘等殊效之藥，獨推德國「補肺拿爾」為最！儿一切慢性氣管炎，小兒百日咳，傷風，均有　騐，且此藥不但因含　魚熊　之肝。肺。　。荷爾蒙，以壯補虛弱，慷胃增食，防止一二三各期肺癆；並因係蛋黃素複製削，用於烟客咳痰及戒　，允為對症，力厚而性純，毫無刺激，若能常服，補肺强身。</p>
<h3>抗淋血淸愈我沉疴</h3>
<p>— 新浦傳佈慈來函</p>
<p>昔年染淋，初不經意，後則醫　雜投，未受其益，病益難愈，兩側畢丸腫硬，痛楚萬分！去秋復又少腹疼脹，小便頻數，日行廿餘次，坐臥難安，骨節　痛。其苦實非筆墨所能盡，纏綿月許，困瘦不堪。幸經周吉人醫師指示，請姚菊巖醫師施治；經用最新德國發明之抗淋血淸治療，數日即放尿暢利，腹脹全消，未及兼旬，睪腫亦散，痛苦立減。乃用電氣療法，的二星期，全部平復，尿液澄淸。八年沉疴，霍然而起！生機日旺，壯健回復，不啻重生。今閱年餘，得保無恙。因念名醫名藥之功難忘，用函伸謝！藉作同病者之借鏡云。</p>
<h3>白帶可以自治</h3>
<p>— 金月仁</p>
<p>白帶為女子最常見之病，凡手淫與粗暴之房事，皆能擦破膣道粘膜，傳染細菌，遂成白帶。而白帶亦最易招惹細菌，發生不測之險症，固不僅為不孕之大原因也。但一般女性，對此等隱病，恒羞於告人，更不肯求醫治療，余對此病，如係因丈夫淋病而來者，即令其內服「克淋儂」外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」拴塞膣道，三四星期無不治愈，因體虛而久患白帶者，「卡而雪地氏」與「補女容」同時服用，亦恒能於短期內治愈，愈後可以照常生育。此等療法，可以在家自療。聞近來女子採用此等自療法，治愈者甚多云。</p>

<p>淋與滑精</p>
<p>季吾德問：余年二十七歲，身弱，患滑精症已十餘年。前月又得淋病，初則洩出白色，機之以血。屢治未愈，尿管時覺有物阻碍，乞代介紹最有效之良藥！</p>
<p>答…滑精為性神經衰弱之症，不治將深；可速服「補體康」欲徹底根治淋菌，最好請姚菊巖博士治療，於未治以前購服「克淋儂」亦可。</p>
<p>經絕濁流</p>
<p>愛鳳女士問：我素有月經病，自去年起，被丈夫將淋病傳染於我，以致月經停閉，惟有白帶下流。現擬內服「補女容」，不知可吾。</p>
<p>答…貴恙除服「補女容」外同時須外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一方更宜服「克淋儂」，則對於各方面都可顧而易愈。</p>
<p>肺病食減</p>
<p>張叔賡問：敝人患肺病已有三年，近更加甚，吐出痰沫，血絲甚多，夜間盜汗潮熱，身瘦不食。千萬乞示有何良藥將此病治愈。</p>
<p>答…此肺病恐已至第三期矣，殊為危險。可服「補肺拿爾」以治肺病，「强胃精」以振消化機能。則病自可愈，</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病臨床報告</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>老白濁難愈原因與根治法</p>
<p>老白濁難愈之情形，盡人而知之。以余多年來臨症上之經騐，凡素患淋病，雖與女子同房一次，亦有傳染對方之可能；女性膣道，適　淋菌易於生存之地。故不潔之男性，縱雖與女子一度春風，其後男性之淋病，雖經醫生治療證明斷根，但其後復與前日女性同房，此而女性之淋菌，仍傳染已經治愈之男子如是互相傳染，淋病寗有斷根之一日乎？</p>
<p>余遇凡有妻室之淋病患者，不論其新濁老淋，用二種治法，一即將男子老淋病，先以抗淋血淸與電氣療法，及同時投以內服藥「克淋儂」，一方令患者之妻子，內服「克淋儂」，外用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」拴入膣道，其膣道中縱有淋菌，遇此藥未有不死滅者，余自用此治法以來，成績異常優越，雖多年老白濁，治愈後，永不復發。凡有妻子而罹淋病者，無論曾吾傳染妻子，其妻子總以用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為宜，俾有淋病者可以治癢淋病，無淋病者，亦可保險不為淋病所傳染。實一舉二得之治法也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>上海猶太人紀念民族鬥士</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>上海共有猶太人的五百餘人，本月十六日上午十時全上海的猶太人為紀念他們的民族英雄特羅普愛爾多氏死難十六周年，為促成重返巴力斯坦運動，特在慕爾鳴路三十五號猶太總會舉行一次盛大的紀念遊行。</p>
<p>我們大家曉得猶太這個民族，失去他們的國家已有兩千五百多年了，直到現在，他們沒有固定的國土，（聞說蘇聯已有一個猶太人的國家了），足跡遍及於全世界，雖然因為他們善於經商，一小部分的人曾操縱了英美的一部分的金融統治權，可是亡國的痛苦，只要人家的一個輕蔑的微笑，那是已足够使你受用了。</p>
<p>是的，猶太人失了他們的國土有兩千五百多年了，然而他們直到現在，還有要重返自己的國土這種或許被人認「奢望」之念。在上海的五百多個（記着，只五百多個呵！）猶太人，為着準備復國，在十六日那天的集會里，他們已經把靑年武裝起來了：分成幼童，　年，壯年，（分海陸軍），女子等數隊。這種壯烈的行動，在他們是感到亡國的慘痛而所以使之的，在我們將做「準亡國奴」（？）的中國人民看來，實在是要涕淚滂沱了呵！</p>
<p>在猶太人的古國中，現在是雜居着阿剌伯人和猶太人，一九一九年特羅普愛爾多回到巴力斯坦去作建立祖國運動，不幸被阿刺伯人殺死，被殺前，特氏和他的同志五十多人曾作激烈的抗戰。生前特氏曾說過以下這些壯烈的話；「我是一個猶太民族主義者，不管其他，沒有階級，沒有私慾，沒有自己。我是一塊鐵，願為國家而用。如果國家需要一個車輪，我就是一個車輪，如果國家要一根釘，一頭犂，一把鐮刀，我就是！猶太民族主義者是國家願望的結晶，為國犧牲一切！」這些話，現在被武裝了的猶太靑年都能深深地銘記在心中，猶太民族是永遠不會滅亡的了！「楚雖三戶，亡秦必楚」，現在，猶太不是比「三戶」多得多了嗎？</p>
<p>人家亡了二千五百多年的國，現在尙且竭力在作復國的準備，我們究竟是還沒有還沒有到亡國的地步。</p>
<h3>綠色的島</h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>——旅途雜記</p>
<p>航海的第四天，我們到了一座高大的山峯的口岸了</p>
<p>「那是綠色的島」！你看，多麽美麗的島啊！你讀過封神榜，那舊神話里不</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>是描畫過很多有趣的仙境嗎？好吧，我們就算他是蓬來三島吧！」</p>
<p>老伯父迷着眼珠子的望着遠方，一邊拍着我的臂膀。</p>
<p>「島國的山峯是綠色的，老遠的地方也是綠色的。誰都會相信那是神話的蓬萊三島吧？看哪，叢生着茸茸的草，把巨大的而齊整的，西洋的建築物點綴着，一級一級地排列上去一直到那躱在雲霧里的頂尖，山峯的頂上變成了許多迷人的幻影。</p>
<p>太陽遠躱在東海里，所望見的盡是一片深情朝霞把華麗的島國罩籠着，處女似地含笑的呵！</p>
<p>看吧，那西南的一邊，就是九龍，九龍跟綠色的島好似兩姐妹一般，美麗，撩人！你想一想，誰有錢住在這里就享福了」。</p>
<p>老伯伯那麽地指着，嚕囌着，可是，我却不懂得那意思：</p>
<p>「為什麽呢？這己不是我們的國土了。也許做了奴隸啦」。</p>
<p>「小萊兒！你為什麽還要孩子似的說那些話呢」？</p>
<p>他的臉孔顯得陰起來啦，就好像神話裏被戰敗了的仙翁，那痙孿的臉孔漸漸地發顫了。他透了一口氣地，望着深綠色的海。—海面舶着好多華麗而大火船，長長的軍艦，就好像示威的瞪着海岸。一些小汽船飄呀的在行走着，噴出了白色的泡沫。</p>
<p>他說的話有點兒感傷了。</p>
<p>「這世界，到處都是一樣的，有錢人跟有錢人在一起，那管得臉孔和他們的祖國啦！這里，都是那麽樣的物結合成了一個現世紀特產物了。當然，沒有錢的人，也許被剝得，沒有錢的人，在這里的就是奴隸了。」</p>
<p>我懂了，他的話就像一碗冷水淋上我的身上一樣，我的心兒也在跳動起來了，那美麗綠色的島里，却掩飾着那麽多的毒瘡呀！</p>
<p>小火船載着我們進港口，慢慢地，我們一老一少的並立着，靠着欄桿和飄忽的海風接吻着。</p>
<p>「等一會兒我帶你去看看好幾年前的工廠吧！那是我做過工的地方，小萊兒，你可知道？好幾年前省港大罷工的時候，這兒却變成了一個死港了，眞的沒有生氣，一切有錢人的臉孔掛上了焦急的神色啦，我也是那羣里的一個，也會帶着同伴跨過山，遊過海的，回到省城去了。」</p>
<p>老伯伯還是講他的故事，那一串一串不完的，可是的船己到岸啦，那遙長的土敏土的堤岸和高高洋房己睡醒了似的，張大了嘴巴，透出了雜亂的聲音，等候那不斷地進來的旅客們投進牠的懷抱里去·老伯伯又扭緊了我的手：</p>
<p>「我們去玩玩吧，但里面沒有神話里一樣美麗的東西呵！」</p>
<p>不錯，我很陌生地東張西望，那狹小的騎樓底下，還躱着陰影，兩層的電車疲乞地走着。每一家舖子都飄着：「大减價」！「貼本出賣」！………那旗子好像從別處飛來的一樣。</p>
<p>不知不覺，我們己跑到山背上，從綠色草場上望綠色的海面，處女似的太陽又照耀着島國的一切了。</p>
<h3>寂寞</h3>
<p>— 朱明霞</p>
<p>現在己經記不得幾歲了，總之在很小的時候，我突然感到寂寞了。第一次感到寂寞是在母親的眼睛裏。</p>
<p>是一個春天的下午，專門估農民們生意的鄉鎭，在這農忙時候，是靜得連人聲也沒有。我們的家，因為房屋較多，坐憇的一連是離店面很遠，因此在這下午是更靜得連一隻飛過的鳥的拍羽的聲音也可以聽到。小天井裏滿足太陽，但是因為連陰影也沒有，所以反而不覺得了碎石一叢小草高興的長着。</p>
<p>母親坐在一張竹椅上縫衣服，我坐在一張小櫈上開看，不知道還是因為這靜寂的空氣　迫得不能開口呢；還是不想破壞這沉靜的空氣，我們誰都不說一句話？好久，母親忽然悠然的哼起我所以沒有聽見的歌來，這歌聲軟得好像一聲低微的嘆息，就在這歌聲越哼越低的時候，忽然遠處傳來，「丁當」「丁當」的聲音，這是鎭尾的那家鐵店的打鐵。</p>
<p>本來是整塊的岑寂，這時因為打鐵的聲音的敲碎而更加顯得岑寂的濃厚了。同時鄰家燒什麽點心的炊烟，更輕輕的嫋着。這時母親突然放下手裏的縫紉，眼睜睜的望着這亂石中間的一叢小草，也現在這時候，我突然在母親的眼睛中看到我經一次看到的東西————「寂寞」。</p>
<p>像一塊沉重的鉛壓上我的心頭，以此再也無法推開。</p>
<p>是的，在某一些時候，我也曾經忘記了這「寂寞」的。但是這時間並不很久長，同時時間一年一年的過去，這塊鉛也一年一年的加重了。最近這塊鉛重到幾乎載不起的地步。</p>
<p>以大體說來，寂寞的襲來說是從下午開始，特別是晚上，錯黃的電燈一亮，這寂寞總是分外的加重。黃仲則詩「百憂如影落燈前」，我想這裏所謂百憂到一半是寂寞。</p>
<p>假使是有知識的人，那末他大槪總感到寂寞的。歷來描寫寂寞的文章太多了，但只有魯迅先生的一節是眞的寫出了寂寞：</p>
<p>「一所很大的洋樓裏，除我而外沒有別人，我沉靜下去了。寂靜濃到如酒，令人微醺望後窗外，骨立的亂出中許多白點，是叢塚；一粒深黃色的火，是南普陀寺的下班燈。前面則海天蒼茫，黑絮一般的放色簡直要撲上心坎裏。我靠了石欄遠眺，聽得自己的心音。四面彷彿是無量的悲哀，苦惱，零落，死滅，却雜人這寂寞　，使牠變成藥酒，加色，加味，加香……」</p>
<p>因為魯迅先生不是弱者，所以他能够咀嚼這樣濃的寂寞，我不知道世界上到底有多少人就為了這單純的寂寞而自殺？</p>
<p>寂寞並就是悲哀，但是他較之悲哀更使人難受，何况當一個人感到難堪的悲哀，他往往己經以寂寞的重壓下出來了。</p>
<h3>更夜</h3>
<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>在爐火辟拍地響着，和被窩漸漸地溫暖起來的時候，則使對於空疎的房間，人們不禁有着太貪婪的寂寞戀。</p>
<p>窗外，夜風挾着寒冷强調地吹着，在電燈桿頂端的四五根弦綫上配置了凜冽的調子，也强調地奏了起來。夜，有一些恐怖，和一些寒冷。</p>
<p>但是，更恐怖更寒冷的是困頓的眠夢中，疏落地飄了起來的畏寒的更聲。</p>
<p>一隻梆子和一盞燈子一同地，探測着無底的三更五更。</p>
<p>更夜的夜行人，幽靈一般地邁着步子，夜一樣古怪而沉靜的步子。恐怖和寒冷也在他的心底。</p>
<p>對於空疎的房間，有着太貪婪的寂寞戀。對於荒涼的更夜，我是懷了急忙會晤的心情那麽兒期待着。</p>
<p>在困頓的夜裏，我撫摸着疲憊的生活的傷痕，我徒然地用着休息來敷在傷痕上面，徒然地用着悄聲的自然數目來按摩了痛楚；於是有着滯重的太息，在無個睡眠困頓的夜裏。</p>
<p>沒有睡眠慾的亢進，反而對於疏落的更聲，有了親切的味感，懷着那麽急忙的心情期待着。</p>
<p>夜，沒有雜亂的音籟，沉靜得像大海那麽地無涯涘。更聲投於夜的大海裏邊，像一塊石子投於闇闇的水漬裏，密密地擴散着夜一樣可怕的音波。</p>
<p>從遠處的屋角裏湧了過來的梆子的音波，湧進了我的室子裏來，於是我的耳鼓把我牠重新地敘述了一遍，在我的耳管裏便有了裊裊溺溺的音符，低低地迥蕩着的音符。</p>
<p>梆子的音響漸漸地近了，又漸漸地遠了，我記起那條狹小的街巷是彎曲的，抺過了這一條彎曲的街巷，那湫隘的小木橋和泥路直穿過我的屋子，而且躺在屋子的窗外。</p>
<p>漸近着更夫，更換聲，和一盞弱小的紙燈一同地，撩着我的急忙的心，沒來由地我嚥住了太息，一些恐怖和一些寒冷的自私的太息。</p>
<p>迎着古怪的夜行人走來的方向，我們無諱忌地撑起了半截身子，濾過我的惺忪的眼珠，安暇而詫異地望着，那戴着破氈帽的幽靈樣的夜行人，那慵懶的　紅的燈，和那單調的梆子的聲響，落落地探測着無底的更夜。</p>
<p>像聽見了賣夜食者的呌聲那麽地，我感覺無限的深湛味，在眞空的情緒裏，低迥着。</p>
<p>不是聽了更聲吵擾睡眠，而是更聲對於我親切的感覺，催眠的功效。</p>
<p>乞　　　　那些疏落但又親切的更聲。</p>
<p>更聲遠去了，在電燈桿頂端的四五根弦綫上留下餘零的微弱的調子。</p>

<p>（唱）你們正為着我們老百姓，為着千百的婦女兒童，受了極名譽的傷，躺在這病人院的床上，各位先生各位勇士，帝國主義，為着要逃脫深刻的恐慌，他們是這樣的瘋狂，自從佔領了我們的北方，又進攻到我們的長江。</p>

<h3>彈詞</h3>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇　長生殿「宮怨」</p>
<p>西宮夜靜百花香。欲播珠簾春恨長。貴妃獨坐沉香榻，高燒紅燭候君王。高力士。啟娘娘。今宵萬歲落昭陽。太眞聽說添愁悶。懶洋洋自去却宮妝。和衣睡倒鴛衾上。見一輪明月照宮　。孤單冷　　睡！</p>
<h3>娜拉（十三）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作圖　忻炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉心神不定地走來走去，看到那一箱子的奇裝跳舞會用的衣服格外心亂了，她試控地問媽阿納：要是她離開了孩子，孩子們是否會忘掉她？她又想出去……</p>
<p>當她心緒煩亂的時候，林敦夫人來了。林敦夫人答應帮她修整那件「意大利的漁女」的舞衣。在她們的談話裏，談起了南陔醫生，林敦夫人以為南陔和她有什麽茍且，責備她為什麽做事這樣不檢點？</p>
<p>娜拉解釋着說，借錢給她的並不是南陔，南陔是一個可憐的脊骨癆者，他對林敦夫人的名字好像非常熟悉，而郝爾茂見面時反而好像一些也不認識的緣故，是因為郝爾茂一聽到她提起從前的朋友便非常妬忌，而南陔却歡喜聽她談從前的事情。</p>
<p>談起錢，林敦夫人看出了娜拉的心神不定的神色，於是問她究竟有什麽事瞞着她。</p>
<p>娜拉正要說出來，郝爾茂却回來了。</p>

<p>陣陣心酸淚兩行。勸為人莫把君皇伴。伴駕猶如伴虎郎。想正宮何等花容貌。何故將媽撒邊傍。倒不如。嫁一個風流子。朝歡暮榮度時光。紫薇花相對紫薇郎。</p>

<h3>滑稽大王羅克新作「無膽英雄」將公映</h3>
<p>— （秋）</p>

<h3>Overview of Methods for High-Altitude Weather Observation</h3>
<p>Nanjing: There are six methods for high-altitude weather observation used by the Central Meteorological Observatory: 1. Pilot balloons: After the balloon rises, its planarity and azimuth are observed from the ground using instruments to calculate its speed and direction. 2. Tethered balloons: Instruments are suspended from the balloon and tethered with sun-dried silk. After the balloon bursts at high altitude, the instruments can be recovered to observe the records. 3. Radiosondes: The rising distance is the highest, but the instruments must be allowed to fall naturally. 4. Manned balloons: People ascend with the balloon, carrying instruments and recording at any time. 5. Kite observations: Large kites are used to suspend instruments for high-altitude weather observations. 6. Aircraft observations: Ordinary weather observations are carried out inside the aircraft. Among them, China does not have the equipment for manned balloons. Kite and tethered balloon observations were once tested in Beiping. Aircraft observations are currently handled by the Aviation General Station on a monthly basis. Pilot balloons are released once a day in both Nanjing and Beijing. Radiosondes are released simultaneously by various countries according to international regulations to observe the climate conditions around the world during the same period. In the past, radiosonde experiments used acoustic recording. The results of the test in July of last year, although the instruments were found in Panyang, were unsuccessful because the instruments were damaged. The instruments used this year are automatically recorded and were found in Nantong. The test results are satisfactory. The instruments released on the 20th of this month have not yet been reported. These instruments are very light and can drift with the wind. Because Nanjing is not far from the sea, they may have fallen into the sea, and it is unknown. The release date designated by international regulations is in July, and they must be released again at that time. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany Considers Reply: Future of European Situation Depends On It; Berlin Meeting Late Into The Night, No Decision Reached; Locarno Pact Is Not Unchangeable</h3>
<p>Berlin: German officials held an important meeting last night at 12 o'clock to discuss the Locarno Peace Plan. Attendees included the German leader Hitler, Ribbentrop, who is attending the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in London, Aviation Minister General Goering, Foreign Minister Neurath, Army Commander Blomberg, and Naval Commander-in-Chief, etc. As of the time of this dispatch, there is no knowledge of any resolution. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: General Ribbentrop, the German delegate to the League of Nations Executive Council meeting, will bring back Hitler's reply to the proposals in the Locarno Pact formed by England, France, Belgium, and Italy, tomorrow. Ribbentrop flew to Berlin last night on a special plane, and immediately went to Wilhelm Street to report everything to Hitler, so that the German government could be fully informed before responding. Before the German reply arrives, the situation will temporarily become calm. British Foreign Secretary Eden is ready to be consulted at any time. Yesterday afternoon, he went to Chequers, stayed overnight with Prime Minister Baldwin, and returned to the Foreign Office today. Everything opened in the Locarno Pact is just a suggestion from the four countries. If Germany proposes another plan to maintain the overall situation during the interim period before a new solution can be convened and established, and it can be agreed upon by the four countries, it is not necessarily unchangeable. This has already been stated in the agreement of the four countries, and General Ribbentrop is also aware of it. However, any contribution must come from all parties. Now the public is eagerly awaiting Germany to make some concessions in order to proceed with the discussion of the broad range of events caused by Hitler's recent memorandum. France has already made a great contribution to the overall situation. People from all walks of life here say that France has temporarily shelved its major rights under the Locarno public agreement. France has not only withdrawn its request for Germany to withdraw its troops from the Rhineland, but also accepted a position that, if the judgment of the Hague Court is unfavorable to France, France will abide by it. Furthermore, France will also endure the relationship caused by the impact on the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: All sectors here are now waiting quietly for Germany's reply to the draft agreement of the Anglo-French-Belgian-Italian agreement. Political figures believe that the German government will definitely refuse to accept all of the draft. What the British government is worried about now is not how the reply will be worded, but the tone and theme of the reply, so that there is still the possibility of continuing the meeting. (21st Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin: A senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently commented on the draft agreement formed at the Locarno Conference, saying, "This document is based on the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles as its destination. Politicians from various countries were gathering in London yesterday, and they almost got the dates wrong, thinking that they were still 17 years ago." As for how the German government will respond, it is currently unknown. It is said that before Monday, Leader Hitler will not express his position. When the leader delivers an election speech in Wroclaw on the sixth resolution tomorrow, he may mention this matter and explain the German attitude in detail. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Berlin Newspapers Criticize Four-Power Agreement, Oppose Establishing Temporary Demilitarized Zone</h3>
<p>Berlin: The newspapers in Berlin are all criticizing the draft of the Locarno Treaty and remain silent on the government's adopted policy. The Nazi Party's organ, the "Attack Newspaper," reiterated Chancellor Hitler's speech in Hamburg yesterday, saying, "We are fighting for our national rights and will never retreat a single step." It also stated that the draft treaty's proposal to establish a temporary demilitarized zone (20 kilometers east of the Rhine River) within German territory is an absurd concession. "As for seeking justice from the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, Germany does not object in principle, but this method is not timely at the moment. The mutual assistance pact between France and Russia is a conflict between us and the Locarno pact, not a legal issue, but a political one." A renowned reporter, Schaffer, published an article in the Berliner Tageblatt, stating, "The draft Locarno Conference agreement is not a 'fait accompli,' but a list of wishes expressed by the signatory countries as a basis for negotiation. Unfortunately, this draft agreement is overly ambitious and harmful to Germany's dignity. Even if negotiations are desired, it should be thrown into the wastebasket. If the British want to continue discussions, they should first eliminate major obstacles, namely, the establishment of an international police force within 20 kilometers east of the Rhine River and seeking justice from the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Germany can refuse this outright, or propose a counter-proposal. In short, a compromise that is not appropriate is insufficient to solve the current difficulties, which everyone should know." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Newspapers continue to comment on the draft Locarno Treaty, but the German government's attitude remains unexpressed. Regarding the establishment of a temporary demilitarized zone east of the Rhine, only the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that it is unacceptable to Germany. The Kreuzzeitung stated, "The memorandum proposed by the Locarno Conference has not been unanimously agreed upon by the four signatory countries. Italy has not yet signed it. According to news from Rome, the Italian government still maintains a reserved attitude." The Lokal-Anzeiger stated, "The effect of the decisions made at the London Conference is still unknown, but any solution that does not take into account German honor and Germany's needs for survival is unacceptable to Germany. This is what all countries should remember." The semi-official Berliner Börsen-Zeitung criticized Britain, stating, "British diplomacy has failed to be independent to such an extent that the prestige of the Foreign Office has been diminished. It is natural for the British newspapers to come out and defend it, but the Foreign Office must work hard to extricate itself to be effective." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Eastern European Security: Poland is Extremely Concerned and Sees Promoting Relations with France as Essential</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Former Chief of the General Staff, General Sikorski, recently published an article in the Warsaw Courier, the organ of the moderate opposition party, discussing recent changes in the military situation in European countries. He stated, "If Poland wants to deal with these changes, the most sound way is to maximize the alliance between Poland and France. If both countries can act in good faith, this alliance can be integrated with the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact previously proposed by France. I know that the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact is not welcomed by Poland, but if we continue to oppose it, the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact may become a military alliance between France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Now, if Poland takes the initiative to participate in a general non-aggression pact, the country's position will inevitably become stronger and the situation will change for the better." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The government's newspapers, the Polish Courier and the Polish Express, are severely criticizing the Locarno Four-Power Agreement and expressing concern about the League of Nations, which has never been seen before. The Polish Courier stated, "Since the establishment of the League of Nations, international disputes have been resolved without bloodshed more than once. Take the German abrogation of the Locarno Treaty on March 7 as an example. If France and Belgium did not have the League of Nations as a shield, who knows what kind of tragedy would have occurred? We must cherish this shield, otherwise war may break out at any time." The Polish Express commented on the news from London that Poland advocated convening a meeting of Germany's neighboring countries, saying, "Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister, said in his speech to the League of Nations Council that 'Any event that is related to the interests of a certain country should not exclude that country from the discussion.' The so-called convening of a meeting of Germany's neighboring countries must have arisen from this. However, if the memorandum submitted by the German government on March 7 is indeed submitted for discussion in the future, the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty should naturally participate. Even other countries involved should be allowed to participate, but this is different from the so-called convening of a special meeting." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Strong Opposition in the British House of Commons to Bearing Military Obligations</h3>
<p>London: Today, all newspapers here revealed news of opposition in the British House of Commons to the draft four-power agreement, especially regarding two proposals: that the German border be temporarily guarded by international troops, and that Britain bear military and political obligations. This opposition is as strong as the previous opposition to the Hoare-Laval Pact. The Daily Mail declared, "The British House of Commons has expressed opposition to the important proposals of the four-power draft, which makes us feel the urgency of a new crisis is imminent." (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>On Establishing Peace: Belgian Newspaper Changes Tone to Favor Germany and Suppress France</h3>
<p>Beijing: The "Weekly Sound Newspaper" here, which usually praises France in its commentary, published an article today entitled "Permanent Construction," suddenly changing its original tone and defending Germany, saying, "German citizens have only one wish, which is, as Hitler said, to seek peace with neighboring countries. If we can use more reason to criticize the facts, we can promote mutual understanding and seek to rebuild the European political situation, which will be more perfect than what was stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. Those who specialize in concluding military agreements and refuse to negotiate with Germany should know the reasons for the outbreak of the past World War and know what to be vigilant about." (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Observers Believe Germany Will Not Firmly Refuse and Isolate Itself</h3>
<p>Moscow: A semi-official person recently commented on the draft agreement reached at the Locarno Conference, stating, "Justice and common sense have prevailed, which can be seen in the resolutions passed by the Locarno Conference. I believe the German government will not explicitly refuse it. Germany's economic and financial difficulties are increasing day by day, and it may not explicitly refuse this draft agreement to confront the world's consciousness, leading to complete isolation. The general public also believes that the spirit on which the Locarno draft agreement is based is an important step in the cause of peace, because 'moral forces have been mobilized as a result.'"

<h3>German Parliament to Be Re-elected at the End of the Month: List of Candidates Released; Most Are High-Ranking Leaders of the Nazi Party</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Parliament's general election is scheduled for March 29. The Nazi Party has nominated 1,035 candidates, most of whom are high-ranking leaders of the Nazi Party, and the rest are people who have contributed to the party. The number of members of the new parliament will be the largest ever, but the exact number will depend on the number of voters. The total number of voters exceeds 44 million. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The government has released the list of candidates for the House of Representatives. There is one candidate for every 60,000 people nationwide, for a total of 1,035 candidates. All are members of the Nazi Party, with Chancellor Hitler heading the list. The candidates are divided into two parts: 59 of them appear on the lists in each constituency and will undoubtedly be elected. All cabinet members and party leaders affiliated with the Nazi Party, such as Saar Regional Commissioner Bürckel, Labor Service Director Hierl, SA Leader Lutze, SS Leader Himmler, Nazi Party Foreign Affairs Director Rosenberg, Nazi Party Youth Leader Schirach, and anti-Semitic agitator Streicher, are on the list. The remaining candidates include Ribbentrop, Germany's representative to the League of Nations Council, Papen, Minister to Austria, Hugenberg, former leader of the German National People's Party, Duke of Coburg, President of the German Red Cross, and Prince Wilhelm, the eldest grandson of the deposed emperor. However, Economics Minister Schacht, Foreign Minister Neurath, Finance Minister Krosigk, Justice Minister Gürtner, and Transport Minister Rubbergall are not party members and are not on the list of candidates. In addition, Defense Minister General von Blomberg did not submit his candidacy because the new military service law prohibits soldiers from engaging in political activities.

<h3>After the Franco-Soviet Pact Takes Effect, Discussions on Implementation Methods: Russian Ambassador Visits French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Paris: After the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact was approved by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (the Chamber of Deputies voted on February 27, and the Senate voted on the 12th of this month), it has taken effect. The Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin, met with Foreign Minister Flandin this afternoon to discuss implementation methods. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian Authorities Hold Talks in Rome: Seeking Closer Political and Economic Cooperation; Relations Between Austria and Czechoslovakia Show Signs of Approaching</h3>
<p>Rome: Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kánya are holding talks here with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is expected that an agreement will be reached to further strengthen the existing cooperation between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Other countries in the Danube region will also be allowed to participate. Hungary is reportedly seeking to include the revision of the Treaty of Trianon and the restoration of armaments into this agreement, but Austria has reservations about this. In addition, since Chancellor Schuschnigg's previous visit to Prague and Czech Premier Hodža's return visit to Vienna, relations between Austria and Czechoslovakia have become closer. This should be promoted in the future agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. It is also rumored that Chancellor Schuschnigg may travel to the capital of Yugoslavia to establish an Austrian-South Slav agreement, following the recent relations between Czechoslovakia and Austria, but this is unlikely to happen in the coming days. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: The Chamber of Deputies hosted Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Schmidt, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kánya this afternoon. Prime Minister Mussolini personally attended in his Party Army uniform. The Speaker of the House, Ciano, delivered a welcoming speech, saying that the relationship between Italy, Austria, and Hungary has always been very harmonious. After the League of Nations decided to impose sanctions on Italy last year, both Austria and Hungary refused to participate, and the relationship between the three parties became even closer. "The League of Nations, blinded by its own interests, does not hesitate to be hostile to Italy. Austria and Hungary have been able to correct this and treat Italy with true friendship and maintain a joint relationship with Italy, which Italy will never forget," he said.

<h3>Naval General Committee Approves Draft Naval Treaty: Italy Expresses Unwillingness to Be Restricted Until the Situation in the Mediterranean is Clarified</h3>
<p>London: The Naval Conference's General Committee reviewed the draft naval treaty this morning and approved it. Regarding Item 4 of Part 1, which states that signatory countries shall not build 10,000-ton cruisers, U.S. Chief Delegate Davis issued a statement saying that this provision is only effective during the treaty's validity period, i.e., before 1942. If the shipbuilding programs of the signatory or non-signatory countries exceed the scope stipulated in this treaty, then the guarantee clauses stipulated in this treaty may be invoked. The French delegate also expressed the same opinion. The delegate from the Union of South Africa declared that the Union was willing to sign the treaty individually. The delegate from the Irish Free State, Duranth, the Free State's special commissioner in London, said that the Free State had decided not to sign the treaty, citing two reasons: the Irish Free State is not a naval power, and the naval treaty could have a dangerous impact on the Free State's policies. This statement caused great shock, because Duranth had attended and participated in the Naval Conference since it opened at the end of last year, and only now did he suddenly express this opinion. The U.S. delegation will leave for New York as soon as the naval treaty is signed on Thursday morning next week. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Naval Decision Official Admiral Cavagnari spoke in the Chamber of Deputies today, referring to the naval treaty concluded by Britain, France, and the United States in London, saying that the treaty did not fully satisfy them technically, but that they were willing to do their best to eliminate the differences that now exist. The conclusion of the treaty will limit the full freedom of naval action, a freedom that they feel must be maintained within the naval scope as long as the current situation in the Mediterranean exists. The political situation caused by Italy's expedition to East Africa has created a crisis, which may cause a tragedy at sea. He is saying this not to reveal secrets, because this has long been expected. Italy's shipbuilding program is proceeding without slowing down. In addition to small warships, several submarines are now under construction. New cruisers, destroyers, and a large number of submarines will be launched this year. The supply of fuel required by Italy has greatly increased, and soon they will have the necessary reserves to safely cope with all possible disputes. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: Naval Determination General Cavagnari recently made a speech in the Chamber of Deputies stating that "The London Naval Conference has just drafted a naval treaty, and Italy's attitude towards this treaty will be reconsidered after the current situation in the Mediterranean is clarified." Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Italy has been forced to expand its national defense equipment due to the situation. "The future enemy has already felt it and should know that once an accident occurs, the Italian Navy will be able to cope with it and maintain its honor." He also said that the Naval Conference had no direct relationship with Italy at first, and the reason why Italy sent representatives to attend was to fulfill the promises made in the past. "As for the naval treaty drafted by Britain, France, and the United States, it is technically difficult to satisfy Italy, and it is significantly different from Italy's original claims. However, in order for this treaty to achieve concrete results, Italy has worked hard to bring divergent opinions closer together in order to ease naval competition. This has been the case in the past, and will continue to be the case in the future. In short, no matter what, even if the new naval treaty is declared immediately, it cannot affect Italy's complete freedom of action, because this freedom of action is required by Italy due to the situation. This attitude cannot be changed as long as the current situation in the Mediterranean has not been clarified," he said. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister to Abolish the House of Representatives: Replacing It with a Corporate Council; So That Representatives of Farmers and Workers Have the Opportunity to Participate; Twenty-Two Corporations Hold Their First Decisive Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Rome: According to reliable sources here today, Prime Minister Mussolini will announce the abolition of the Italian House of Representatives next Monday at the Pan-Fascist Corporation Conference, and replace it with a council of corporations. At that time, Mr. Mussolini will probably explain the detailed methods for electing representatives of corporations, so that employers, workers, farmers, technicians, and professionals across the country will each have representatives to organize Italy's legislative body, like a management of a large industrial company by experts. Over the years, Mussolini has organized Italy's corporations, always hoping that the domestic system would take the Corporation Department of the Cabinet as the highest authority, followed by the National Conference of Corporations, and the Central Committee organized by the twenty-two corporations, and then the local trade unions, so that there would be representatives in all regions. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: Prime Minister Mussolini formed twenty-two corporations in November 1934. These corporations are scheduled to hold their first decisive meeting here tomorrow, which will be chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini himself. The agenda is the progress of the various corporations since the League of Nations implemented sanctions. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Warship Damaged Again in Secret</h3>

<h3>The Issue of Domination of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>The election of foreign directors to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) in the International Settlement is scheduled for today and tomorrow, with voting by all foreign taxpayers. The Japanese side is demanding an increase in the number of Japanese directors from two to three, based on the reason that the population has increased sharply and the number of director seats should be allocated in proportion to the taxes paid. They officially submitted a list of three candidates for director at the last minute of the nomination deadline on the 14th of this month, declaring an automatic additional election. The Japanese side has been making extremely meticulous arrangements for the election campaign in recent days. The British and Americans are also sharpening their spirits to deal with the competition. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome of the election, if the Japanese side wins or if the SMC accommodates the Japanese side's will and agrees to a compromise plan to increase the number of directors, then the current situation of the SMC will inevitably be broken. From then on, Japan's power in the Shanghai International Settlement will have a legal basis and will inevitably expand and leap forward. Therefore, this election has a significant meaning in the history of the concession.</p>
<p>The foreign directors of the SMC have always been dominated by the British, who have held an absolute advantage of more than five seats. In the ten years before 1927, the British directors consistently held more than six seats, while the Japanese only had one seat. From 1927 to the present, the control of the nine foreign directors has been five for the British, two each for the Americans and Japanese. Only in the 1932 election did a Dane win an American director seat with the help of the Japanese. After the Japanese side made a request to increase the number of directors this year, the British and Americans, mindful of the 1932 repetition, also took swift action and held a primary election. As a result, the number of candidates proposed by the British and Americans is equal to the number of seats to be elected. It is unprecedented for British and Americans to have five or two candidates join the competition. From this, it can be seen that the British and Americans are trying to use concentrated electoral power to compete with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Among the foreign taxpayers with voting rights in the International Settlement, there are 934 British, 893 Japanese, 400 Americans, 200 Germans, and 1,073 from other countries. The Japanese are the most organized in voting. The number of Japanese voters has consistently been above 80%. In last year's election, 775 Japanese voted, 565 British, and 247 Americans and residents of other countries. This election, in terms of individual strength, will still be led by the Japanese. However, if the British and Americans can thoroughly cooperate, they can also get 1,334 votes according to last year's vote count, and it will be difficult for the Japanese to achieve their wishes without the help of residents of other countries. If the British and Americans cannot cooperate, then the British retaining five seats will not be a major problem, but the Americans will inevitably sacrifice one seat to supplement the Japanese. In short, if the British and Americans cooperate, it will be difficult for Japan to succeed. If they do not cooperate, it will be easy for Japan to succeed. The situation of the SMC is like this, and the entire situation of the Pacific can also be viewed in the same way.</p>
<p>However, from the standpoint of us Chinese, the ebb and flow of the power of the British, Americans, and Japanese in the SMC is still a key issue. What we should pay most attention to is the position of us Chinese in the SMC. If the current situation of the SMC does not change, then so be it. If there is a change, can we still not take the opportunity to strive for the equality of Chinese taxpayer rights? In terms of population, the number of Chinese living in the International Settlement is almost more than 18 times the total number of all foreign residents. The annual tax obligations borne by the Chinese account for 90% of the total. In law and in reason, the minimum number of Chinese directors should be more than half of the total number of directors. However, among the 14 directors, there are only five Chinese directors. This extremely unfair situation has long been opposed by us. Now that the Japanese, using the sharp increase in population as an excuse, have made a request to increase the number of director seats, it is time for us Chinese taxpayers to firmly fight for the equality of Chinese taxpayer rights.</p>

<h3>Imminent War Preparations Between Japan and Russia: Rushing to Expand Naval and Air Forces; Japanese Army Drafts a Six-Year Military Plan; Soviet Russia Launches 100 New Submarines</h3>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>The Army's 2 billion yen six-year military plan has been clarified. Its purpose is to expand the air force to match the Soviet Union. On the one hand, it plans to expand the current Army Aviation Headquarters to establish an Air Force Ministry, parallel to the Navy and Army ministries, to exclusively command the air force. However, the Navy opposes the establishment of the Air Force Ministry, unwilling to part with the naval air corps. Therefore, some people intend to propose a compromise, advocating that after the establishment of the Air Force Ministry, it should not interfere with the independence of the naval air corps for the time being, and then promote its automatic merger at an appropriate time. If the Air Force Ministry is inconvenient to establish at present, the current Aviation Headquarters will be upgraded to be parallel to the General Staff Headquarters to facilitate the exercise of air force command.

<p>According to reliable sources, in order to cope with the covetous glances of its two powerful neighbors to the east and west, the Soviet Union is not only spending huge amounts of national currency to strengthen its land and air forces, but also actively expanding its navy. Its purpose seems to be to build a large submarine fleet that dominates the world, and nearly a hundred have already been completed and launched. There are more being rushed to completion than this number. The deployment status is roughly 40 in the Baltic Sea, 20 in the Black Sea, 6 in Northern Europe, and 30 in the Far East.

<h3>The February 26th Incident Shocked the World: The Full Picture of the Japanese Coup; Suicide of Rebel Generals Adds to the Tragedy; Okada Escapes and Donates Property</h3>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>On February 26, an unprecedented rebellion suddenly occurred in Tokyo. At that time, the authorities, considering the serious nature of the incident, prohibited all reports except for the official announcement. However, on the 22nd, the scope of this report was slightly relaxed. According to reports, the twenty officers, including Captain Nonaka, who had been discharged, participated in this rebellion. The troops involved were parts of the 3rd Guards Regiment, the 1st Infantry Regiment, the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and the 7th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, totaling more than 1,400 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. Several civilians, such as Ikki Kita and Shūmei Okawa, also participated. They initially attacked the Prime Minister's official residence, the residence of the Minister of the Imperial Household Saitō, the private residence of the Inspector General of Military Education Watanabe, the private residence of the Finance Minister Takahashi, the residence of the Grand Chamberlain Suzuki, the dormitory of the former Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, the Yubara Itoya Hotel, and the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun. The three senior officials, Saitō, Takahashi, and Watanabe, were assassinated and killed, and the Grand Chamberlain Suzuki was seriously injured. Prime Minister Okada escaped by having his brother-in-law, Colonel Matsuo, die in his place. Count Makino also escaped unharmed. The rebel troops then occupied the high ground in Nagata-cho, Kojimachi Ward, centering on the Prime Minister's official residence and the newly built Diet building. A state of emergency was declared at 3:00 AM on the 27th, and the 1st and 2nd Guards Divisions were mobilized. Troops from nearby areas such as Sakura, Mito, Utsunomiya, Takasaki, and Matsumoto were successively sent to Tokyo to maintain order and take charge of security. At the same time, various means were used to suppress the rebel troops, and the rebel army surrendered without firing a shot on the afternoon of the 29th. Among the rebel officers, Captain Nonaka committed suicide, Captain Kono committed suicide, and most of the others, such as Muranaka, Isobe, and Okawa, as well as civilian participants, were detained in the garrison prison. As for the surrendered soldiers, they were separately detained in various districts. However, more than 1,320 of the soldiers were released from detention on March 18. As a result of this incident, the Okada cabinet resigned en masse. The mandate to form a cabinet was temporarily given to Prince Konoe, but he declined, so Foreign Minister Hirota was ordered to form a cabinet. After great difficulty, it was established on March 9, taking on the heavy responsibility of resolving the extraordinary situation. Furthermore, due to the occurrence of this ominous incident, six army elders, such as Hayashi, Mazaki, Abe, Araki, Minami, and Kawashima, felt responsible and resigned from their current positions. Although this unprecedented rebellion has been quelled, its shadow remains, such as the suicide of Major Amano, the injury of Major Katakura, and the suicide of Captain Aoshima and his wife. Many tragic stories are included in this account. (22nd Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada, who was attacked by rebel soldiers at 5:40 AM on February 26, the day the incident broke out, was able to escape because his brother-in-law, Colonel Matsuo, died in his place, saving his life. It is said that Prime Minister Okada was hiding in a closet in the inner room and was able to leave the official residence on the afternoon of the 27th, disguised among the mourners. His escape was described in a statement issued by Secretary Fukuda, which has already been reported. Since the incident, Prime Minister Okada has been living in seclusion in his Yodobashi residence, being extremely cautious, praying for the repose of the souls of the victims, and living a lonely life. It is said that he will donate all of his property to the Matsuo family and the families of the police officers who died, to express his gratitude. (22nd Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Rebel Soldiers Redeem Themselves Through Merit: Sent to Serve in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>It was previously reported on March 19 that more than 1,320 soldiers involved in the incident were questioned, released from detention, and ordered to return to their original units. Now, they live in the barracks with ordinary soldiers. Since most of these troops are to be sent to serve in Manchuria, the various units to which they belong must begin training. Some have been assigned to important duties and are treated the same as ordinary soldiers. Fortunately, the soldiers all know their mistake and deeply regret their previous actions. They are determined to wash away their shame in Manchuria and are now working with enthusiasm. (22nd Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held for Saitō's Remains</h3>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>The official funeral of Saitō Makoto, the former Minister of the Interior who died in the February 26th incident, was held at Honganji Temple in Tsukiji on the 22nd. The ceremony was extremely solemn and tragic. More than 700 wreaths were presented from various quarters. At 9:40 AM that day, his remains were escorted out of his residence by his family members. Funeral Committee Chairman Kodama and others participated in the procession. Members of the Japan Boy Scout League and a naval honor guard commanded by Colonel Hara also participated. The ceremony began at 10:30 AM, with the participation of Prime Minister Hirota, other cabinet members, naval admirals such as Suetsugu, Nakamura, Nomura, Kobayashi, Kato, and many other dignitaries from the political and financial circles and various fields. From 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, a farewell ceremony was held for the general public. (22nd Allied Press)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang</p>
<p>The Burden of Land Tax on Farmers in the Southeastern Countryside of Wuxi — Weng Zushan</p>
<p>1. Not Scratching the Itch</p>
<p>In the process of the collapse of the rural economy, "land tax" has also played a huge role in destruction. In the past, most scholars focused on studying the amount of tax and surcharges. Their pens rarely touched the "deep-rooted abuses" of the collection system, which is a big mistake. The rate of increase in surcharges is indeed alarming, but if we look at the farmer's extra expenses, we will find that this "invisible surcharge" often exceeds the visible surcharge several times! Therefore, to understand the reality of harsh levies and extortion, in addition to observing tangible figures, we must look for the methods of collection and the process of collection. For several years, what we have heard is nothing more than: "Surcharges are overlapping, and the people cannot bear it," "The people feel the pain most deeply from surcharges," "There are many land tax surcharges in various provinces... causing the peasants great suffering," and so on. In fact, none of them are scratching the itch!</p>
<p>The nature of Chinese farmers is docile. Although they are getting thinner year by year, the relief of "not owing the imperial grain above and not owing private debts below" is still what every farmer dreams of. Now the land tax surcharge in Wuxi has increased to 1.6 times the regular tax, and they still "pawn and mortgage to repay," with absolutely no complaints! Only this "invisible surcharge" has no fixed amount and is left to the extortion of the tax collectors, making it impossible to escape! A young farmer once said: "I think the 'Tu Zheng' who eats five liters of rice per mu of farmer's land should be considerate of our poor people. Who knew that he would collude with the village chief and do all kinds of evil, even making a big profit on the payment of grain to the state. With such insatiable greed, even if we shed all our sweat and blood, working like cattle and horses all our lives, we cannot afford to support them!" This is indeed the cry of the majority of the exploited. The extortion of the tax collectors should not be ignored any longer!</p>
<p>2. General Observations</p>
<p>According to what I know—Guonan Township, Wuxi—whether it is "self-assessment and deposit" or paid on behalf of the Tu Zheng, the extra expenses are always unavoidable. The exact amount of money and grain to be paid can only be known after seeing the "receipt" (notice), and the receipt is in the hands of the Gang Zheng. Often, several months after the start of the land tax collection, the Tu Zheng's receipt has not yet been issued. This does not pose a difficulty for literate landlords and merchants—they can go to the grain counter to copy the numbers themselves. But ordinary farmers have absolutely no way to do it and must beg the Tu Zheng in every way. Usually, the farmer's money and grain are handled and paid on behalf of the Tu Zheng. Or they advance the money first and then charge the farmers double. The vicious Tu Zheng is even more extortionate, with no standards at all. Not only is the receipt not issued, but even the serial number cannot be obtained. The honest and simple farmers think that once the money has been paid, everything is done. How would they ever think that they would have to face a lawsuit for back taxes after one or two years? There are countless examples of this kind of "the debt is not owed by the people, and the money is not received by the government." In addition to "floating receipts" and "secret receipts," there are also large extra demands. The expenditure is more than one item a year, and it is not just the Tu Zheng who can extort money from the farmers. According to the usual situation (although the farmers are unable to pay, they have come to regard it as a standard), the "Qu Shu" and "Tu Zheng" each collect two units from the farmers every year: one or two liters of rice per mu at rice harvest time, and one or two liters of wheat per mu at wheat harvest time. In years when the price of rice and wheat is low, cash is collected instead, with the principle that it should not be less than the highest price of rice and wheat. As for the vicious ones who collect five or six liters per mu or only collect white rice and not wheat, it is also often heard. Here are two more points to note: First, the so-called one or two liters of rice and wheat per mu per year is not an absolute number. Generally, for those with more than ten mu, the odd numbers are not counted, and those with less than ten mu often exceed this number. And 63% of the farmers here have less than ten mu. Second, the amount of extortion is proportional to the distance from the towns. The closer to the city, the less is collected. The farther away from the city, the more is collected. Less is collected in the market towns, and more is collected in the villages. As for "remote and backward areas" or in three-family villages, "heaven is high and the emperor is far away," and there is even more "lawlessness"!</p>
<p>These are general observations.</p>
<p>In addition to oral and scattered materials, I also conducted a simple investigation. This investigation covered nine households with 54.5 mu of land. The nominal regular and surcharge taxes totaled 32 yuan, 8 jiao, 1 fen, and 7 li (Note 1). The actual expenditure was 75 yuan and 5 jiao in legal tender, 2 shi, 4 dou, and 8 sheng of brown rice, and 1 shi, 8 dou, and 5 sheng of wheat, equivalent to 26 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen in legal tender (Note 2). The total was 102 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen. The actual expenditure was more than 8 times the regular tax and more than 3 times the regular and surcharge taxes. The amount of the floating receipt was slightly less than 3.5 times the surcharge. Below are some actual examples:</p>
<p>From this statistic, we can see how alarming the farmer's land tax expenditure per mu is! But what is the government's actual income?</p>
<p>Note 1: Wuxi has flat fields, polder fields, and shoal fields. The tax is based on the standard of flat fields, at 1.0169 yuan per mu. The rest are less than 1 yuan. There are no flat fields in these 50+ mu, so the average is only 6 jiao and 2 li per mu.</p>
<p>Note 2: Today's market price of brown rice is 7-8 yuan per dan, now calculated at 7 yuan. Wheat is 7 yuan per jiao per dan, but at harvest time it is only 4 yuan and 5 jiao, so it is now calculated at 5 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Ethiopian Government Sends a Note to Geneva: The League of Nations Should Mediate a Peace Agreement; Based on the Spirit of the Covenant, Respect Territorial Integrity; Request Effective Cessation of Italian Army's Brutal Acts</h3>
<p>Thirteen-Nation Committee to Meet Today</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The League of Nations Thirteen-Nation Committee is scheduled to meet at 10:30 AM on Monday, at which time a new Italian-Ethiopian peace agreement can be restarted. (21st National News Agency)</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government yesterday sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, expressing acceptance of the cessation of hostilities between Italy and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Minister to France, Gedamu Haile Mariam, came here from Paris yesterday to prepare to attend the League of Nations Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee. Another note was sent to Avenol, denying the talk of direct negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, and stating that reports that Italian troops had recently broken through Ethiopian defenses were also untrue. It said, "Six months after the start of the war, although the Italian army is brutal, the Ethiopian people have not yielded. Their determination to fight the enemy is even stronger. Rumors that the people of various parts of Ethiopia do not hold a unified attitude towards Italy are also groundless." The note also stated that the Ethiopian government has quickly expressed its acceptance of the peace proposal put forward by the Thirteen-Nation Committee. The Italian government's reply only agreed in principle. The Ethiopian government specifically requested the Council to ask Italy again whether it was prepared to "respect Ethiopia's territorial integrity and conclude peace with Ethiopia 'within the framework of the League of Nations and in the spirit of the Covenant.'" (22nd Havas)</p>

<p>The Ethiopian Minister to France, Gedamu Haile Mariam, also sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, stating that after Ethiopia was subjected to aggression, the member states of the League of Nations unanimously condemned Italy's acts of aggression. However, Italy turned a deaf ear and continued to bomb Ethiopia and foreign aid teams, and used poison gas to kill innocent civilians. The Ethiopian government hereby requested the Council to take necessary measures to stop these brutal acts. (22nd Havas)</p>

<p>A report from General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, received in Rome, only mentioned that the activities on the two fronts were very lively. However, according to news received from non-official circles, large-scale battles are currently underway. It is reported that the Ethiopian army on both fronts began attacking the Italian army's lines of communication yesterday. A total of two large armies participated. One was commanded by the Ethiopian Emperor and attacked twenty miles behind the Italian army outpost at Amba Aradam near Antalo. The other was a force commanded by Generals Seyoum and Gassas, which reportedly attacked the Italian army's line of communication between Ashiaghe and Magale from the side, sixty miles further north, and had gained an advantage. Even further north, the forces of General Ayilu had entered the territory of Eritrea. Italian planes are now bombing Jarre, where the commander of the Ethiopian army has reportedly established his headquarters under a rocky mountain invisible in the sky, and only a few of his guards know its location.

<h3>Severe Flooding in the Eastern United States: Followed by a Blizzard; Relief Work is Difficult; Material Losses Reach 500 Million Yuan; 300,000 Homeless</h3>
<p>Pittsburgh, USA: At a time of severe flooding, a blizzard has struck today, making it difficult for relief workers to try to prevent epidemics in this and dozens of other cities. The filth left behind after the floodwaters recede is very dangerous, so residents and relief workers are doing their best to clear it away at night in the darkness of ankle-deep snow. The military and government agencies are trying to restore the water supply and disinfect the reservoirs. In rural areas where the water has not yet receded, food and medicine are transported by car and plane. The authorities estimate that the losses in Pennsylvania will be between US$250 million and US$500 million. (21st National News Agency)</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>The peak of the floods in the United States is rolling downstream today. In the fourteen eastern states, at least 209 people have died, including men, women, the elderly, and children. 320,000 people have been left homeless. The minimum estimate of property losses is US$250 million, but Pennsylvania authorities have announced that even that state alone is more than that amount. The city of Hartford in Connecticut is still raining today, but the water has receded slightly at night. There appears to be new danger in northern New York State, as heavy rains have resumed, the snow has melted, and mountain torrents are flowing down, flooding both banks. Many industrial areas along the Merrimack River in northeastern Massachusetts have been flooded. Many of the electric plants there have also been shut down. The number of homeless and unemployed is countless. Fortunately, it seems that the dangerous period has passed tonight in most other places. (21st National News Agency)</p>
<p>Portsmouth, USA: The Ohio River continues to flow south, flooding the cities of Portsmouth, Gallipolis, Ironton, Ohio, and Plaisented and Huntington, West Virginia. Because residents there had precautions, they have all carried their belongings to higher ground, and relief work has been prepared early. (21st National News Agency)</p>
<h3>The American Industrial Reform Association: Submits Recommendations to Roosevelt; How to Avoid a Recession</h3>
<p>New York</p>
<p>The Industrial Reform Association today submitted a report to President Roosevelt, suggesting ways to avoid future recessions. The report opposes managing industry by government decree, such as the now defunct National Recovery Administration, but advocates legislation to control wages and prices to stabilize the American economic system. Unlimited competition can lead to unequal income, and if this continues, a more serious economic crisis will inevitably occur than this one. As for how to avoid it, the report suggests the following:</p>
<p>* Set minimum wages and maximum working hours to avoid labor price competition.</p>
<p>* Use collective bargaining to maintain wages above the minimum.</p>
<p>* Set minimum prices.</p>
<p>* Allow commercial organizations to enforce fair practices.</p>
<p>* Study the problem of technological unemployment.</p>
<p>* For the sake of labor protection, impose quantitative restrictions on imports and implement effective anti-dumping laws. (21st National News Agency)</p>

<h3>Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued): A Scene of Devil Dancing</h3>
<p>The annual Devil Dance was about to begin, and we were swept along with the crowd to the plaza on the right. We secured a carpeted seat in front of the temple, where there was already no empty space in the arena. The audience was seated by soldiers wielding leather whips, and over a dozen photographers with cameras had already climbed onto the rooftops. Several foreigners with movie cameras were also mixed in.</p>
<p>The sound of drums and gongs rose, and the crowd grew silent. Four dancing skeletons appeared in the center of the plaza, followed by comical big-headed monks, ferocious ox-headed and horse-faced figures, and lively little deer. Each dance scene progressed with the rhythm of the drums and gongs, advancing and retreating. In the final scene, a devil made of tsampa (roasted barley flour) was placed on a plate in the center of the arena. A bull demon king-like deity, after a series of dances, knelt before the devil, raised a dagger in his right hand, and hacked the devil in the plate into several pieces. Several deer deities then shook their heads and wagged their tails around the scattered tsampa, celebrating their victory. This is a story from Tibetan religion about eliminating devils who destroy religion. Most monasteries have similar, slightly different versions of this dance.</p>
<p>The local Han Chinese thus associated this with "slaying Nian." "Nian" refers to Nian Gengyao, who pacified the west in the early Qing dynasty. He executed eight lamas at the Tar Temple, who are now buried in front of the "Small Golden Tile Temple," marked by eight pagodas. The lamas in the temple have hated him for generations. Each year during the Devil Dance, they mold him into a devil of tsampa, dismembering him as revenge. Therefore, the devil represents Nian, and this scene of the dance is called "slaying Nian."</p>
<p>Tourists Swarm</p>
<p>Inside the temple, we only saw swirling dust and a sea of people. According to the temple's estimates, the total number of attendees exceeded 30,000, of which 60% were Tibetans, 20% were Mongols, 20% were Han and Hui people, and 7 or 8 were foreigners taking photos. This year, because the Panchen Lama was residing here, the Mongol and Tibetan people had a triple purpose: to pilgrimage, to pay homage to the Living Buddha, and to see the lantern display. Many were Mongols from Alashan and Qaidam, and Tibetans from Yushu and Nangqian, who had traveled from afar, making the event even more lively than in previous years.</p>
<p>Their tents filled the valleys for ten miles around. The narrow mountain paths were packed with a throng of people. Many Tibetan men wore new silk robes, with heavy silver bowls and headdresses adorned with coral and shells on their backs. Many Mongols leading camels were interspersed among them, creating a unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>From Yuershal to Tar Temple, the mountainside along the several-mile road was lined with merchants' tents. The Mongol and Tibetan people crowded here, packed like sardines. Copper and iron tools, fabrics, jewelry, colorful paper, and steaming snacks on the stalls all sold at ten times their usual price.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, we went up the mountain for some fresh air. Groups of dozens of Mongol and Tibetan men and women were already worshiping on the mountain paths, prostrating themselves until they were covered in dirt, showing their utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>Today, the Panchen Lama chanted scriptures in front of the main hall. Three thousand five hundred lamas clapped and stamped their feet, discussing the scriptures. An entranced audience prostrated towards the Panchen Lama's shadow from the stone steps hundreds of paces away. Many kneeled down even without seeing the shadow, and countless weak individuals stood behind them, their foreheads unable to touch the stone steps at the temple entrance, making their long journeys seem in vain.</p>
<p>Beautiful Butter Lamps</p>
<p>Tonight is the Lantern Festival. Wherever there is Lamaism, the butter lamps of Tar Temple are considered the most exquisite and magnificent, so the Mongol and Tibetan people are proud to have a glimpse of the butter lamp stands.</p>
<p>The butter lamps are manufactured far in advance, half a year prior. The artisans who make the butter lamps take 1,500 catties of butter from the temple and quietly create them in a secret room, where no one is allowed to observe.</p>
<p>After sunset on the Lantern Festival, they display the magnificent butter lamps in a tent – a canopy – embroidered with Buddha images, allowing people to admire them. The Panchen Lama is the first to view them, and then it is our turn. In the darkness, two lamas led the way with lanterns. One lama used a whip to clear a path through the crowd, leading us directly to the shimmering lights on the right side of the Great Golden Tile Temple.</p>
<p>Two large butter lamp displays were placed on the east and west sides, like colorful bas-relief archways towering to the top of the twenty-foot-high canopy. Below, a row of bright butter lamps illuminated a vivid Buddha statue in the center of the archway. On either side of the Buddha, pavilions, towers, trees, flowers, people riding horses, and people strolling were all arranged in recreational scenes. The clothing of the figures and the colors of the flowers and trees were bright and pleasing to the eye. The exquisite and lifelike workmanship was like the real thing. Especially under the flickering lamplight, it almost felt like being in a wax museum in Paris. Most strikingly, a pair of winged bombers hovered in the sky above the ornate buildings, and a blooming cannon was firing on the ground, seemingly symbolizing the ominous signs of war.</p>
<p>The crowd was too dense, so we hastily retreated, following the lama around the Great Golden Tile Temple. There were seven or eight places along the way with smaller butter lamps, but the workmanship and colors were much poorer. Most had only a triangular panel and a two- or three-foot-tall Buddha statue. The crowds were not as dense here, and the sincere old women were kowtowing towards them.</p>
<p>The festival will be over tomorrow. At eight o'clock in the morning, we took the original car back. The tents along the road were being dismantled in succession, and the crowds were heading back in all directions.</p>
<h3>The Plight of Chaozhou-Meizhou People Deceived into Going to Siam: Five to Six Hundred People Detained in Siam, Now Imprisoned Awaiting Bail and Release</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In recent years, industries and commerce in various parts of Southeast Asia have been in decline, and many overseas Chinese have returned home after losing their jobs. However, after returning home, these people still face unemployment, hunger, and cold due to the collapse of the rural economy in their hometowns. Therefore, they still seek opportunities to go to Southeast Asia. Last year, the prices of rubber and tin in Southeast Asia slightly increased, and industries and commerce showed signs of recovery. Overseas Chinese who heard the news vied to go there. Unscrupulous merchants on general ships and in hotels seized the opportunity to cheat and profit. They manipulated the prices of ship tickets and sent people around to deceive overseas Chinese, concealing passengers to various ports in Southeast Asia. As a result, they were repeatedly discovered by the colonial governments of Southeast Asia, leading to wrongful imprisonment. Recently, the number of impoverished overseas Chinese from Chaozhou and Meizhou who were deceived into going to Siam and ended up in prison has reached four to five hundred people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Since Siam implemented its immigration law, overseas Chinese going to Siam have been hesitant due to the cumbersome residency procedures. Ship companies and hotels have suffered from reduced revenue as a result. Therefore, they colluded to cheat and defraud. First, customer heads and escorts were sent out from various hotels to the Chaozhou area to falsely claim that the Siamese immigration regulations had been changed, that the residency fee and import license fee had been reduced to 50 baht, and that no other inspection procedures were required. If they were transported by these people from Shantou to Siam, they would only be charged 70-80 yuan per person for a safe passage. As a result, many villagers in the hinterland who intended to go to Southeast Asia but were unaware of the details were deceived. They borrowed from relatives and friends or sold their property to raise funds and went to Shantou with the customer heads and escorts to wait for ships to Siam. Once the money was paid, they were taken to the ship and hidden in bamboo baskets or in the corners of the cabins, coal piles, and cargo holds. The unscrupulous merchants only cared about money and did not care about the safety of the deceived passengers. On the 12th of last month, a certain ship represented by a certain company in Shantou sailed from Shantou to Siam. On the 20th of this month, upon arrival in Siam, the head of the Siamese Public Security Bureau, based on a report that the ship was secretly carrying a large number of passengers to escape entry, immediately dispatched more than 60 police officers, immigration officials, and undercover agents to inspect the ship. As a result, more than 180 people were apprehended. On the 29th of this month, a certain ship arrived in Siam again and was subjected to a strict inspection, resulting in the discovery of another 423 people. When the ship arrived in Siam, all the passengers were arrested. Due to the large number of passengers, the order was extremely chaotic. The inspection time for the ship lasted for more than 20 hours. Except for a small number of passengers with entry and exit permits who were fortunate enough to leave, the rest were not allowed to take a step beyond the bounds. The next day, after another inspection by immigration officials, those who were trying to sneak into the country were arrested and sentenced by the Siamese court to a fine of 200 baht each. However, because everyone admitted to evading entry, the punishment was reduced by half to 100 baht. Those who could not pay the fine were imprisoned for 100 days in lieu of the fine, and then deported back to their country upon completion of their sentence. After this tragedy occurred, overseas Chinese in Siam sought to rescue them. The Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce once held a meeting to discuss relief measures and initially intended to pay the fines on their behalf to get them out of prison. However, because the number of detainees reached 500-600 people, requiring more than 60,000 baht, and because of the current economic downturn, fundraising was difficult, so no agreement could be reached. As a result, it was decided to publish a notice explaining the difficulties of the Chamber of Commerce and asking relatives and friends of the detainees to find ways to rescue them, and to translate the Siamese immigration law and send it to the authorities in Shantou, Guangzhou, and Haikou to inform the public and avoid being deceived. At the same time, the General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various shipping companies, warning the ship staff not to deceive overseas Chinese into going abroad.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed at Tianjin Main Station Affects Railway Freight; Pseudo-Police Inspection of Passengers Leaving the Pass Also Affects the Business of the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since last winter, when a Japanese military police unit was stationed at the Tianjin Main Station of the Jinpu Railway to monitor train operations, it has been several months now and they have not yet withdrawn. The military police unit consists of five people, occupying half of the waiting room on the second platform of the main station as a temporary office, where they eat and sleep. Whenever freight trains arrive at the station, they go out to inspect the number and number of the cars and record them one by one. They are somewhat lenient with trains coming from the north, but they are unwilling to let trains going south pass easily unless the number of cars matches the number coming from the north, and even then they generally only allow trains with no more than fifteen cars to pass. At the same time, the Tianjin Main Station freight yard must store about thirty freight cars every day, which makes the Jinpu Railway's train operations extremely inconvenient. Recently, with the arrival of spring, freight transport is booming, and goods transported south are piling up in the freight yard like mountains. Freight owners have repeatedly urged the railway authorities to transport the goods, but because the scheduling is restricted by the Japanese military police, they cannot load as desired. The Jinpu Railway's Tianjin Office has negotiated with the Japanese side on this matter several times, but the Japanese side claims to have received secret reports, so this difficulty in foreign affairs is difficult to resolve in a short time. Earlier this month, the pseudo-National Border Police Team of Yuguan banned Chinese from leaving the pass and issued a new law requiring all passengers leaving the pass to pay 20 yuan for a special identification card. Those who leave the pseudo-national territory within one month can get 19 yuan back from the Yuguan Datong Company with the original card. The Beining Railway Bureau believes that this measure affects its business and has sent a letter to the Oriental Travel Agency for negotiation. Igarashi Fangji, the manager of the pseudo-Yuguan Datong Company, came to Tianjin for this matter to contact the Beining Railway and explained the process of handling this matter, seeking to avoid misunderstandings. The Beining Railway Bureau requested the company to consult with the pseudo-National Border Police to change the method in order to facilitate passengers and avoid losses to the railway's business. At the same time, passengers who were unaware of the new restrictions on entry outside the pass would not be stranded on the way. After Igarashi returned, the Oriental Travel Agency negotiated again, and the pseudo-Border Police began to be less strict in restricting passengers leaving the pass than before. Currently, they have adopted a quick method. Passengers taking the Ping-Shen through train get off the train at Yuguan and line up on the platform. The pseudo-police quickly inspect and interrogate them within the 40 minutes of the train's stop. At the same time, staff from the Datong Company sell exit permits. Upper-class people are charged one yuan per permit according to the old rules, while small vendors and laborers are still charged 20 yuan per permit to restrict entry. If the inspection is not completed when the train is about to depart, they are allowed to take the next pseudo-Fengshan Railway Shen-Yu through train to leave the pass. However, the Oriental Travel Agency and the Beining Railway Bureau believe that this is still not a convenient way for passengers, so they hope that the pseudo-police and people from the Datong Company can inspect passengers and sell exit permits on the train to save time and avoid delaying passengers' journeys. The station where the procedures will be handled is still under study. The pseudo-Border Police Team and the Datong Company have no objections to this principle and are waiting for their opinions to match before implementing it. (20th)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Recruiting Chinese Laborers to Open Mines; Many Workers from Wenzhou Apply; Japanese Side Also Sends Personnel to Fujian to Recruit Widows</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In recent weeks, many workers from Wenzhou have been traveling to Taiwan from Xiamen by ship, reportedly in response to an invitation from the Jilong Jin Guishan mining area in Taiwan. The mining area has been mined by Japanese entrepreneurs for gold, coal, and other minerals since the beginning of the Republic of China. Recently, due to the needs of the so-called emergency period, the mining has been intensified and there is a great need for labor. In addition to declaring that they will increase wages, the mine owners have ordered Chinese workers in the mining area to invite their relatives and friends to work, and have also sent personnel to Fujian to recruit workers, especially widows. As a result, many Japanese ships have traveled to Taiwan, carrying large numbers of workers from Wenzhou who have applied for the job, some bringing their families with them. It is said that gold mine workers can earn 50 Japanese yen per month, while coal workers can earn 30 Japanese yen per month. All food is paid for by the workers themselves, and travel expenses are also paid by the workers themselves. The entrance permit fee for workers going to Taiwan is about 13 yuan, while it is slightly higher for merchants, about 2 or 3 yuan more. Since the New Year, more than a thousand people have traveled to Taiwan in an endless stream. Many workers from Fuqing have also been exported from Fuzhou. Recently, it was discovered that people in Anxi were distributing leaflets recruiting workers to go to Taiwan. It is said that those who work in the mining area must first undergo training.

<h3>Henan Province Planting Trees Along the Zhangwei and Qi Rivers; Poor Results from Past Tree Planting; Construction Department Seeking Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Tree planting along the Zhang, Wei, and Qi rivers was carried out once last spring, with a total of 2,139,187 trees planted. Because there is a lot of good farmland on both banks, and the government is short on funds, it cannot buy it at market price. People are unwilling to let the trees survive due to their own interests, resulting in only over 150,000 trees surviving. In order to remedy this, the Construction Department reduced the width of the afforestation area to 50 meters last winter, stipulating that from November 15th to December 15th, the rivers should be cleared and measured in sections for afforestation, with a wooden stake inserted every kilometer to calculate the number of trees to be planted and the number of acres and labor required. From December 16th to January 15th of this year, the willow cuttings that should be planted were inserted. From February 1st to March 15th, persimmon, paper mulberry, yellow ash, ailanthus, chinaberry, walnut, cypress, poplar, ash, and other miscellaneous trees were planted. In addition to dispatching ten technicians from the Kaifeng First Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Xinyang Second Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Nanyang Third Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Luoyang Fourth Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and Huixian Fifth Agricultural and Forestry Bureau to various counties to supervise and guide, the county magistrate of the local area was also assigned as the chief supervisor, the section chiefs along the river were assigned as supervisors, and the afforestation area was divided into sections of every five or ten miles, with the section chiefs assigning the baojia chiefs as section leaders, and each team consisting of 50 afforestation laborers, with the section chiefs assigning team leaders. Currently, each county has reported completion. Except for mountainous areas such as Shexian, Tangyin, and Linxian, where planting is done according to the terrain, the rest are planted using the square planting method. The afforestation locations and lengths are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhang River: (A) Shexian, from Guojia Village on the border of Shanxi to the south of Hezhang Village, about 70 kilometers long, mostly planted on the mountainside or summit on the south bank. (B) Linxian, from Niuling on the border of Shanxi to the east of Huige Tavin Village, about 34 kilometers long, also planted on the mountainside on the south bank.

<h3>A Tour of the Central Hospital in Nanjing: A Towering Four-Story Building Stands Beside Zhongshan Road; Its Equipment is Comprehensive and the Number of Patients Seeking Treatment is Extremely High</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The Central Hospital is the leading national hospital in the capital. Under the leadership of Secretary Lu Tianmu, we were given a tour of the hospital. The following is a record of its general situation:</p>
<p>In 1929, after the wartime Military Medical Administration Committee was dissolved, the current hospital director, Liu Ruiheng, received a personal instruction from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to prepare the Central Model Military Hospital as soon as possible. It was to accommodate sick and wounded soldiers while also providing medical services to the public. Immediately, fifty acres of land formerly belonging to the Banner system at the corner of Zhongshan East Road and Huangpu Road were acquired as the hospital site. On one hand, thirteen wooden prefabricated hospital buildings and X-ray machines, along with other medical equipment, were ordered from the United States. On the other hand, specialists in various fields were hired, and medical services were immediately initiated. In January 1930, another instruction was received from Chairman Chiang to rename the Central Model Military Hospital as the Central Hospital and place it under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health. This marked the beginning of the hospital's establishment. In the spring of 1933, a newly constructed four-story building was completed, costing one million yuan. The overseas Chinese philanthropist Hu Wenhu donated 370,000 yuan, with the remainder provided by the government. On June 18th, all departments and wards were moved into the new building. All the previously constructed wooden buildings were then converted into school buildings, dormitories, and a library.</p>
<p>When the hospital was first established, it only had departments of Internal Medicine, Surgery, and Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, etc. In 1933, it was divided into departments of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry, Urology, Orthopedics, Dermatology, Pediatrics, and Tuberculosis. In addition, there were attached departments of Radiology, Electrotherapy, and Laboratory. The number of beds was also expanded from 275 to 336.</p>
<p>The hospital building is three-dimensional, shaped like two "凸" characters joined together. It faces south from the north. The outpatient department is on the west side, with the registration area to the left and the cashier's office to the right. In the center is a bronze bust of the donor, Hu Wenhu, surrounded by railings. Above it hangs a horizontal plaque inscribed with the four characters "益在民生" (Benefit to the People's Livelihood), presented to Hu Wenhu by the National Government. This area has many seats, intended as a waiting area for patients. Moving forward from here, the medical records room is on the left. For returning patients, after completing the registration procedures, their medical records are retrieved and sent to the attending physician. All past symptoms and diagnoses are recorded, following the model of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, with the intention of preserving them for twenty to thirty years. Therefore, all medical records from the opening in 1929 to the present are preserved. This is similar to the archives of general administrative agencies. On the right is the pharmacy, staffed by more than ten pharmacists and assistants, who were busily preparing medications. Several basic solutions were also pre-prepared for immediate use. Medications for inpatients are requisitioned from the pharmacy daily by the nurses, who then distribute them to the patients. Further ahead are the various department clinics, emergency rooms, and the social services department. For poor patients, after investigation by this department, all consultation fees and examination fees can be waived. Another section is the administrative department and the infectious disease ward, which has been isolated. It currently houses fifteen patients, including two children. The conditions include tuberculosis (consumption) in eleven people, pneumonia in one person, chickenpox in one person, gonorrheal eye disease in one person, and congenital syphilis in one person. Afterwards, we visited the electrotherapy department, which has several high-frequency diathermy machines and short-wave diathermy machines. Their function is to treat pneumonia and sterilize, among other things. In addition, there are hot light lamps, which can treat muscles and improve blood flow.</p>
<p>The eastern part of the second floor is the X-ray room. At this time, an X-ray examination was being performed on the arm of a child, perhaps six or seven years old. The child was crying because of the change in environment, but in reality, it was no different from a regular photograph and did not involve any pain. We then visited the operating room. In the center was a bed where more than ten doctors and assistants were performing surgery on a young woman. The temperature in the room was very high, and the doctors were all wearing light clothing and masks. It was said that this was to prevent respiration from affecting the patient's affected area. We faintly heard the young woman's cries, incessant and unending. It was presumed that she had received local anesthesia, so she was still conscious. The western part of the second floor is the second and third wards. First, second, and third class wards are available. First-class wards cost eight to ten yuan per day, second-class wards cost four yuan, and third-class wards cost sixty cents. Except for two or three first-class wards that were still vacant, the others were almost completely full. When patients need something or have a request, they can press the light switch. When the red light outside the ward turns on, a small light in the nurse's office also lights up at the same time, and they immediately come to inquire, avoiding the trouble of the patient shouting. The third floor is the fourth and fifth wards, exclusively for obstetrics and general gynecology. In addition, there are nurseries and delivery rooms. The fourth floor is the sixth, seventh, and eighth wards. The eastern part is the general surgical ward, with two rooms, each with twenty-six beds. Among them, three people were in tilt tables, head down and feet up, in a suspended position. This was because their affected area was in the lower limbs. The western part is the women's internal medicine and pediatric wards, which will also be fully occupied. There are strips of red and blue cloth tightly fixed to the beds. According to a nurse, the red color indicates that the patient needs to drink more boiled water, the blue color indicates that all food and drink should be avoided, and the yellow color indicates that specially prepared food should be given. According to Mr. Lu, every morning, there may still be some space in the beds, but by the afternoon, they are all occupied. Some patients are even turned away due to lack of capacity. According to records, Nanjing, as of recently, including Gulou Hospital and the newly opened Municipal Hospital, as well as other public and private hospitals, has a total of only 906 beds, averaging one bed for every 1,100 people, leading to a supply that cannot meet demand. To alleviate the suffering of patients, it is necessary for Nanjing to add more large-scale hospitals.</p>
<p>According to a report by Hospital Director Liu Ruiheng, the number of patients treated at the hospital in 1930 and 1931 was 57,823. In 1932, the number of outpatients was 46,607. In 1933, the number of outpatients was 71,827. In 1934, the number of outpatients was 96,630. The number of inpatients also increased sharply each year. In 1930 and 1931, it was 5,111. In 1932, it was 4,142. In 1933, it was 4,968. In 1934, it was 6,217. The number of discharged patients in that year was the same as the above figure. The number of deaths was 472. Compared with the 4,946 discharged patients and 401 deaths in 1932, the mortality rate had decreased compared to 1933. As for the number of outpatients and discharged patients in 1935, because the hospital's annual report has not yet been published, it is impossible to speculate. However, according to recent conditions, the number of inpatients each day is around 330, and the number of outpatients is around 500, for a total of 800 people. According to this statistic, the total number of people treated throughout the year will almost exceed 200,000. However, most inpatients are long-term cases. It can be asserted that the number of patients seeking treatment this year will be at least around 150,000.</p>
<p>Jiang Song: Investigate the Case of Resisting Arrest for Opium</p>
<p>Our county is conducting a general crackdown on opium offenders. In recent days, the county government has dispatched a large number of officials to arrest over a hundred opium offenders. The other day, the county government sent Hu Guanxian to inspect the opium den of Cao Yi in Zhelin. It was learned that people with Fengxian County opium licenses were smoking inside, which was clearly illegal. While waiting to consult with the patrol officer to take them to the station, another opium addict came to smoke. Upon inspection, it was found that the soil purchase accounting form did not have blue chops, indicating that the purchase was incomplete. All were ordered to be taken to the station, and the accounts of the opium den were taken back for submission. Unexpectedly, a group of ruffians gathered and shouted, snatching Hu's official briefcase and tearing the police officer's coat. Hu immediately went to the township office and submitted a written report to the county government for handling. Recently, the county government has ordered the arrest of the perpetrators.

Upon receiving this news, Sun resigned passively and automatically, going to the Tangxi County government in Zhejiang Province to serve as a secretary. His duties were temporarily assumed by Gan Shi Jiang Hong. While the provincial party headquarters was searching for a successor, there was no shortage of people in Suzhou seeking this position. They entrusted influential people to recommend them to the provincial authorities. As a result, all failed, and Sun Danzhen was ordered to continue in his position. Unexpectedly, less than two months later, more than forty party members, including Yang Naizhi, jointly filed a complaint with the central party headquarters yesterday, listing four charges against Sun Danzhen, including perverting the law and neglecting his duties, and engaging in embezzlement and corruption. They requested that the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters strictly and thoroughly investigate the matter to uphold party discipline.</p>

<p>Wuxi: Adding Road Surface to the Xiyi Road</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Xiyi Road, the Jiangnan Automobile Company has seen thriving business and annual profits. However, the road surface of the Meiyuan to Lujiang section and the Yixing to Tingqiao section was originally coal slag. Due to long-term erosion, it has been severely damaged. The company has now ordered workers to add crushed stone and coal slag. The Zhoufang Road, which extends for more than ten miles from the west of the Qiting Bridge to Gaosheng, is also being widened to three meters. There is also the Guanyang Road, which is currently under construction. This road is east of the Qiting Bridge and is more than sixty miles long. It will soon be completed.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Agricultural Bank Handles Seedling Loans</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, in order to alleviate the rural situation as the spring plowing season is approaching, has allocated six million yuan to order the farmers banks in various counties to handle seedling loans. After receiving the order, the Wujin Farmers Bank immediately prepared to handle this loan. It stipulates an interest rate starting at one cent per month and is lent to various cooperatives in principle. Starting next month, the loans will be disbursed, with the deadline for repayment set after the autumn harvest. It has also been decided to handle storage and mortgage loans in the autumn of this year and transportation and sales loans in the winter.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Conflict in Hou Shengzhen Investigation of Opium</p>
<p>Jiang Wenbao, an investigator from the Provincial Opium Prohibition Association, learned that someone was privately selling opium in the Yuhe Pharmacy in the second district of Hou Shengzhen. He telegraphed County Magistrate Yan and dispatched Shi Weigong and Wei Jitang, officials from the fourth section, to Hou. They searched the pharmacy and seized 134 taels of opium and arrested the opium trafficker Jiang Qianfu and others. Later, they went to the home of Shen Li to search, but found nothing. Afterwards, Shen Li questioned them, alarming the crowd, who shouted loudly. Investigator Jiang was beaten, but fortunately, the town's business corps rescued him and escorted him to the town office. The opium trafficker was handed over to the county for interrogation on the 21st.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Gathering to Uproot Mulberry Seedlings to Protect Righteous Graves</p>
<p>The area from Erbandianpu on Aozi Street outside the Dongguan Gate of Yangzhou City to the former Provincial Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Institute on the old Wutai Mountain outside the Bianyimen Gate is less than two li. This area was originally a righteous burial ground with about two thousand graves. This year, the institute needed land to plant mulberry seedlings and reported to the county bureau to acquire the land. On the 20th, it dispatched more than sixty workers, carrying mulberry seedlings, to plant them, inevitably damaging the graves. The local people, seeing the graves being destroyed and bones being thrown, suddenly rang the gong and gathered hundreds of people, uprooting all the planted mulberry seedlings, making a menacing scene. Fortunately, the workers at the site saw that there were many people and retreated. On the 21st, Wang Shishan, the town leader of Shenglongzhen, in addition to reporting to the county bureau, planned to submit a statement to the civil and military halls, stating the reasons for protecting the righteous burial ground.</p>

After receiving the order, in addition to the Huaiqi Section Works Office moving to Suqian first to make way, the bureau had already transported two batches of equipment, charts, and files to Pu. It had also sent technicians Xu Shouzhi and Zhang Peiqiu, and inspector Wang Zizun to Pu to arrange everything. On the evening of the 19th, Director Xu Dingkang, along with Secretary Shen Baojun and Engineer Sun Fengwu, arrived in Pu on the Xinchun special train with the remaining equipment.

<h3>The Importance and Promotion of Literacy Movement (Part 2): Section Chief of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>— Zhong Lingxiu</p>
<p>However, to implement this method, the government must make the greatest determination and use strict compulsory methods. Although some people in important positions may not have time to teach people to read, we can think of other remedies to replace them. In this way, the problem of teachers will not be a major problem. As for literacy textbooks, many are needed. It would be great if there were funds to print them. If there are no funds, literate people can each copy three copies and give them to the illiterate people they should be teaching. In this way, the textbook printing costs can also be saved. In addition, the educational administrative authorities can order students at all levels of schools to copy several copies each semester. Those who have a calligraphy class can change their calligraphy time to copying literacy textbooks. Taking into account the total number of university students, vocational school students, secondary school students, and upper primary school students across the country, tens of millions of copies can be copied each year. This is another way to remedy the shortage of literacy textbooks. In addition, the paper and brushes needed to promote literacy education can also be reused by using scrap paper and the paper used to wrap objects, as well as the back of various discarded mimeographs. If they are sorted and flattened, they can be used as paper for illiterate people to write and calculate on. So-called "waste utilization" can be used to find as many poor ways as possible to remedy the situation. There must be many things that can be utilized. In this way, there are considerable remedies for schools, teachers, textbooks, paper, brushes, etc. It is possible to save costs everywhere. Although it is not possible to save all costs, it is possible to save a large portion. Therefore, the cost problem is not very problematic. Therefore, as long as the government makes the greatest determination, strictly supervises, and mobilizes all parties to work together, the method of compulsory literacy education can be boldly implemented with swiftness and efficiency. There is no great difficulty.</p>
<p>The above are all active methods. In addition, passive methods should also be used to supervise them in order to remedy the shortcomings of compulsory methods. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>Illiterate people between the ages of sixteen and fifty must enroll in nearby community schools, literacy schools, or other literacy places within a certain period of time to receive literacy education. Those who violate this rule will be punished.</p>
<p>Illiterate people between the ages of sixteen and fifty must recognize the prescribed minimum number of characters within the prescribed time limit. If they still do not recognize the prescribed number of characters after the deadline, they will be punished.</p>
<p>Literacy verification points should be set up at all traffic intersections, city gates, train stations, and docks. Those who cannot prove that they are literate must be inspected. Those who pass the test will be allowed to pass. Those who fail the test must pay a "literacy donation" before being allowed to pass.</p>
<p>When hiring people for various agencies, groups, factories, companies, banks, stores, etc., they must be questioned. Illiterate people will not be hired.</p>
<p>After the literacy deadline has passed, drivers of cars, horse-drawn carriages, and rickshaws who are found to be illiterate will not be issued driving permits and will not be allowed to drive or pull carts.</p>
<p>Literacy checkpoints should be set up at the entrances to libraries, museums, educational halls, stadiums, parks, and other entertainment venues. Literate people can freely enter and exit. Illiterate people must pay a "literacy donation" or buy a ticket before being allowed to enter.</p>
<p>If the above active methods and passive methods are used together, the effect will be greatly enhanced. However, there will inevitably be many omissions. It is hoped that comrades who are enthusiastic about the literacy movement will make many additions. Only a few examples are listed here.</p>
<p>In the past two years, many provinces and cities have actively promoted the literacy movement and strictly enforced compulsory measures, with remarkable results. For example, Shanghai, Qingdao, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui are all working very hard. In the near future, they will be able to realize their plans one by one, which is admirable! Now, the national crisis is serious and getting deeper day by day. Illiterate people who are ignorant and uninformed will not only be unable to save the country, but will also be unable to stand in the world of the twentieth century, where the superior prevails and the inferior is eliminated. We should be determined that "there is no room for illiteracy under the Three Principles of the People" and work hard to promote it actively. It is hoped that people across the country will pay attention to it and promote its success.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Afternoon; He Will Go to Beijing After Recovering from a Cold</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui, who has decided to resign from his position as a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arrived in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month. He visited Hu Zhantang, chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and other important figures in the Southwest to discuss national affairs. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. on the Italian postal ship Victoria. Mr. Wang had a slight cold en route. After disembarking, he went to the hospital to recuperate. He will go to Beijing after his body recovers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Victoria entered the port at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf at 11:00 a.m. A large number of Mr. Wang's relatives and friends came to the port to welcome him. They included Secretary Tang Shixuan representing Mayor Wu, Zhou Yu, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang in Beijing, Guo Yun'guan, president of the First Special District Court, Wang Simo, president of the Second Special District Court, Xu Weizhen, president of the Second Branch of the High Court, Liang Renjie, president of the Third Branch of the High Court, Luo Tong, president of the District Court, and Deng Zuyu, a friend of Mr. Wang, and Mrs. Zhu, Mr. Wang's wife, and more than a hundred others.</p>
<p>Personnel Arriving Together</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was wearing a long blue silk gown and a thick scarf around his neck. His complexion was slightly paler than when he returned home last time, but his spirits were very good. He shook hands with the welcomers on the ship to express his thanks. Then, he met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship. Immediately afterwards, he disembarked and went to the Hong'en Hospital for treatment. Those who accompanied Mr. Wang to Shanghai included Cheng Tiangu and Mr. Wang's attendants Xiao Jinfang, Zhu Xiaoshan, and Feng Zhizheng. Wei Daoming, the former Minister of Justice, will postpone his arrival in Shanghai for a few days because of unfinished business in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, when he met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship, he gave a speech saying that he had decided to return home and had visited Mr. Hu Zhantang, chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities in Guangdong. Of course, there was some discussion on national and private matters. As for the details, I will talk about them in person later. Because I have a slight cold en route, I have decided to go to the hospital for treatment immediately after disembarking. I will have to stay in the hospital for a few days. After my body recovers, I will go to Beijing. Whether I will go to Fenghua to visit President Chiang is still undecided. Mr. Hu Zhantang's body has gradually recovered to health. He will go north to Beijing to take office after the spring warmth. Mr. Wang then gave his observations on the European situation, saying that although the European situation is very tense, according to what I have observed, there will be no war. The authorities of various European countries are now trying to avoid war.</p>
<p>Appointment with Chiang</p>
<p>Last night, according to Mr. Wang's secretary Xiao Jinfang speaking to a reporter from Xin Sheng She, Mr. Wang had telegraphed Fenghua after arriving in Shanghai to report to Mr. Chiang, saying in essence that after arriving in Shanghai, he entered the hospital for treatment due to illness. As soon as his condition improves slightly, he will go to Beijing. Mr. Wang has a chronic nasal disease. He will relapse whenever he catches a cold. This decision to return home and arrive in Guangdong via Hong Kong was due to the long sea journey and fatigue, and the weather in Hong Kong and Guangdong was also cold, which caused his nasal disease to recur. The journey to Shanghai made it worse. The ship's doctor advised him that if he did not receive proper treatment, there was a risk of it spreading. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, he went to the Hong'en Hospital and asked Bi Gang, a famous ENT doctor in the hospital, for diagnosis and treatment. According to Bi Gang, the disease is not dangerous and can be expected to heal in four or five days if it is well treated. It is expected that Mr. Wang will be able to enter Beijing within a week.</p>
<p>Sun and Xu Express Condolences</p>
<p>Since Wang Chonghui arrived in Shanghai and entered the Hong'en Hospital, because he was afraid of the wind and cold, he followed the doctor's advice and declined all social engagements. Therefore, he declined banquets from Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and others. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, and Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, first went to the Hong'en Hospital for a visit at about 1:00 p.m. However, because Mr. Wang was in poor spirits, they did not have a long talk and left after expressing their condolences. In addition, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also went to visit him.</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan Arrives in Shanghai to Talk About His Impressions of Inspecting the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, accompanied by secretaries Yang Yizhi and Gao Dajing, went to Hankou, Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places last month to inspect the current situation of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. He has now completed his task. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. on the Italian postal ship Victoria. Mayor Wu's representative Secretary Tang Shixuan, Director Zhou Jue of the Foreign Affairs Office, Huang Boqiao of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, Secretary Wang Zhinan of the Municipal Security Office, Zou Bingwen and Chen Xiangtao from the banking community, and Mr. Zhang's wife and dozens of others welcomed him. After disembarking, Mr. Zhang went straight back to his private residence and plans to go to Beijing to report to the ministry in one or two days. According to Mr. Zhang speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency on the ship, his trip to Guangdong, Hankou, Guilin, and other places was purely to inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The result was very satisfactory. The various sections of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be connected in May and will be open to traffic in September or October. The Guangdong Provincial Government will designate Huangpu as a commercial port and plans to request the Ministry of Railways to allocate funds to build a branch line. This matter is related to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway itself and is currently being discussed. As for the news report that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will be connected to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, I am not aware of it. I did not discuss this with the Guangdong authorities during my visit to Guangdong. As for the construction of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, the Ministry of Railways has this plan. How to proceed is still under discussion.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Ambassador Instructs Japanese Residents Not to Damage National Dignity</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," a welcome reception for Ambassador Arita was held in this port on the 21st, attended by over 300 Japanese officials and civilians. Ambassador Arita made the following remarks: "I am deeply regretful that I must return to my country so soon after taking office. During my sixteen-day stay in Nanjing, my meetings with key figures in Nanjing have given me a general understanding of the Chinese government authorities' intentions regarding the Sino-Japanese problem. The resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem will likely not be achieved overnight. However, the issue of China is extremely important to Japan and cannot be treated lightly. Therefore, we must seize every opportunity to work to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. I sincerely hope that residents will emphasize their character and refrain from any actions that may damage the nation's dignity."</p>
<h3>The Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, Liu Hangchen, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Negotiating Public Bond Mortgages with Various Banks; Construction Bank Investing in the Chengdu-Chongqing Road Construction</h3>
<p>Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and is staying at a friend's place. Liu's visit is to negotiate the mortgage of 15 million yuan of Sichuan Post-Disaster Public Bonds with the banking community and to organize the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to raise funds for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The New News Agency reporter investigated and reported on these matters as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiating Public Bond Mortgages</p>
<p>In order to complete the bandit suppression work and post-disaster reconstruction in Sichuan Province, the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Liu Xiang, requested the central government to issue 15 million yuan of the 25th Year of the Republic of China Sichuan Post-Disaster Reconstruction Public Bonds, which has been approved by the central government and is scheduled to be formally issued on April 1st. Sichuan Finance Director Liu Hangchen, in view of the urgent need for funds for financial consolidation and post-disaster affairs in Sichuan Province, came to Shanghai earlier this month to negotiate with the Central Bank for an advance loan of 2 million yuan to meet immediate needs, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Liu's current visit to Shanghai is to continue negotiations with the Central, China, and Communications Banks regarding the mortgage of the public bonds. He is scheduled to visit the authorities of the three banks today to earnestly discuss the mortgage methods. Once a result is reached, he will collect the printed public bond certificates from the printing bureau and take them back to Sichuan for issuance. It is reported that after the central government's consolidation of Sichuan's finances, things may get on track when the 25th year begins.</p>
<p>Organizing the Railway Company</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, prepared a plan and consulted with the Ministry of Railways. It was decided to organize the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to be responsible for the construction. According to the New News Agency reporter, the organizational regulations of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company were passed by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 21st. The total amount of shares is set at 20 million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares. The Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each recognize 22,500 shares, and the rest will be raised independently. The company may issue public bonds as appropriate to supplement construction funds and has decided to first build the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing and the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong. After completion, other lines will be expanded. Liu's visit to Shanghai is to conveniently contact the financial community for investment, so that the company can be established as soon as possible. It is also heard that Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, is scheduled to come to Shanghai soon to discuss the company's preparation matters with the financial and industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway</p>
<p>The construction funds for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were budgeted by Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, who also provided blueprints of the railway line to Railway Minister Zhang Jia'ao for instructions. It was approved and tentatively set at 48 million yuan in national currency. Lu had previously consulted with Song Zi'liang, General Manager of China Construction Bank, regarding an investment of 10 million yuan as construction funds for the road. In addition, a loan of 20 million yuan was pre-ordered from France for materials, so that construction could begin in the shortest possible time, with the aim of completing and opening the line to traffic within two years. The above loans are planned to be secured by the post-disaster public bonds issued on April 1st and a portion of the Ministry of Railways' third-phase public bonds.

<p>Paul Barentzen, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, in order to stipulate the procedures for claiming imported foreign goods stored in the wharves and warehouses of transport ships, recently issued Notice No. 1501, stating that starting from April 6th of this year, imported foreign goods stored in the wharves and warehouses of transport ships should be claimed according to the following regulations: All imported foreign goods that have been taxed and approved for release by the Customs must have the Customs-stamped bill of lading submitted to the customs officer stationed at the warehouse to verify that it matches the red inspection slip before they can be claimed. All imported foreign goods that have not been taxed and are reported for transfer or storage in the Customs warehouse must have the Customs-stamped transfer permit or storage permit submitted to the customs officer stationed at the warehouse for verification before they can be claimed. When necessary, goods removed from the warehouse should be re-inspected by customs officers. From the date of implementation of the aforementioned procedures, all goods that have been taxed and approved for release in the wharves and warehouses of steamships approved for direct storage of imported foreign goods must be removed within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) after the customs officer receives the red inspection slip. If the above-mentioned time limit is exceeded, the shipping company should transfer the goods elsewhere on behalf of the owner. All merchants should be informed accordingly. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Stabilize the Exchange Rate of Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy on November 4th of last year, it stipulated the exchange rate of subsidiary currency on the 9th of the same month: one legal tender yuan is equivalent to 3,000 copper coins or 12 dimes, and each dime is worth 500 copper coins. However, since the promulgation of this decree, there have still been those who outwardly complied but inwardly disobeyed. The exchange rate in Shanghai is even more inconsistent, with three phenomena: In the urban area, each yuan is exchanged for 3,050 copper coins or 12 dimes and 20 copper coins. In the French Concession, each legal tender yuan is exchanged for 2,980 to 3,000 copper coins or 10 dimes and 450 to 12 dimes. Furthermore, the exchange rates at tram stations, bus stations, etc., also change at any time, causing travelers to complain. The value of new subsidiary currency ranges from 9 dimes and 7 cents to 9 dimes and 9 cents. People feel deeply pained by the fluctuating exchange rates of miscellaneous coins and eagerly hope that the Ministry of Finance will have practical measures to deal with this. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance plans that during the implementation of the decimal system, those who deliberately manipulate exchange rates will be severely punished according to the law. On the one hand, more 1-dime, 2-dime, and 5-dime new subsidiary currency notes will be printed to supplement the deficiency of nickel coins.</p>
<h3>The Election of Foreign Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Begins Today</h3>
<p>Today and tomorrow (Monday and Tuesday) are the dates for foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession to vote for the foreign directors. The time is from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, without interruption at noon. There are two polling locations: one is the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Drill Hall, and the other is the Hongkou Police Station. The Traffic Section of the Police Department has stipulated that, in order to avoid traffic congestion, vehicles on Jiangxi Road west of the road must travel north, and vehicles on Fuzhou Road north of the road must travel east during the voting period. In addition, several Shanghai Municipal Council officials are on-site to take care of and direct everything.</p>
<h3>The Concessions' Interference in the Collection of Aviation Donations Arouses National Discontent; The Municipal Government Has Sent Personnel to Negotiate Separately; The Aviation Council Will Also Hold a Meeting to Respond</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the interference by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the patrol police of the French Concession in the collection of aviation salvation funds from the hotel industry, the confiscation of receipts, and the abuse of fines have been reported earlier. According to detailed information, the China Aviation Association received a letter from the Hotel Industry Association on the 12th of this month stating that at 2:00 PM on the 11th, the political department of the French Concession police summoned representatives of hotels such as the Asia, Da Hu, Da Fang, Guangtailai, Taian Inn, Ping An, Changjiang, and Taian Business Inn and obstructed the collection of aviation salvation funds in every possible way, imposing fines of 20 yuan on each establishment and threatening to increase the fine to 100 yuan if collections continued. The association asked the government to forcefully argue against this destruction of the patriotic movement. On the 19th, the association received another letter from the industry association, stating that in response to the unreasonable interference of the French Concession, an emergency meeting was convened to discuss countermeasures. While the meeting was in progress, successive reports were received from hotels in the Public Concession such as the Oriental, Great China, Jardine, Shenzhou, Central, New World, Great Jiangnan, Hongkou, and Lingnan, stating that personnel sent by the Municipal Council had ordered the surrender of all triplicate receipt books and account books for aviation salvation funds and forbade further collections, threatening to impose fines or revoke business licenses. Under this pressure, the businesses had no choice but to painfully suspend collections and requested that the association immediately forward a serious protest to the municipal government. The China Aviation Association, based on these letters, forwarded them for negotiation and replied to the industry association, stating that the authorities in the special district violated the will of the Chinese people by suppressing the aviation salvation movement and obstructing fundraising, which was unreasonable. The association said it had initiated separate negotiations and hoped that the industry association would promptly inform all members to continue their efforts to collect funds. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life paid close attention to the matter, because the collection of aviation salvation funds was entirely the result of the patriotic zeal of the Chinese people, who voluntarily and happily contributed. No one should interfere with this. The principle is obvious, but the concession authorities' unwarranted destruction of this effort goes against the principles of friendship. It is reported that the municipal government has sent secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Geng Jiaji to negotiate separately. The China Aviation Association will convene a board meeting in the coming days to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Imports of Annam Rice Amounted to 53 Million Yuan; Our Trade Surplus with France Was 15 Million; Our Trade Deficit with Annam Was 50 Million</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times News Agency, China's foreign trade has a large trade deficit every year. Last year, although Sino-French trade showed a surplus, there was a deficit with French Annam. If Annam's figures are included in those of France, China is in a trade deficit position. If we want to achieve a balance in international trade, the Chinese people must make efforts. The trade situation between the two countries last year is reported below.</p>
<p>Imports from France</p>
<p>China and France have had commercial relations for more than a hundred years. In the last few decades, with the exception of 1934, when China had a trade deficit, China has had a trade surplus in all other years. China's imports from France are mainly metals and mineral sands, but last year these items decreased compared to the previous year. A list of imports is extracted below: Metals, chemical products and pharmaceuticals, vehicles and boats, machinery and tools, wine, beer, spirits, drinking water, dyes, pigments, paints, varnishes, books, maps, paper skins, paper products, wool and its products, miscellaneous metal products, cotton, cotton yarn, candle soap, oils, fats, waxes, rosin, grains and grain flour, silk and rayon products, canned meats and vegetables, daily sundries, and others. Total imports last year amounted to 13,362,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports to France</p>
<p>China's exports to France are mainly textile fibers. Last year, exports of these products to France reached more than 14,194,000 yuan, a significant increase compared to the previous year, but less than in 1933. Animals and animal products totaled more than 3,631,000 yuan last year. Kernel sundries also increased last year, but tea exports declined, falling short of half of the previous year, and only a quarter compared to 1932. A list of China's important exports to France is listed below: Textile fibers, animals and animal products, kernels, wax, raw hides, tanned hides, leather goods, mineral sands, metals and metal products, piece goods, tea, plant-based dyes, and others. Total exports were 29,245,000 yuan. Compared between the two countries, China had a trade surplus of more than 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Annam Rice Volume</p>
<p>Among China's trade relations with French colonies, Annam is the most important. From 1886 to last year, China had a large trade deficit. In 1932, the trade deficit was the largest, reaching 77,694,451 yuan. Although it decreased to 36,846,000 yuan in the previous year, it increased again to 57,000,003 yuan last year. The important reasons for this are: first, Annam obstructs and mistreats Chinese goods in many ways, and second, China's rice supply is insufficient, so it purchases large quantities of rice from Annam every year. Last year, Annam rice imports to China reached 53,850,226 yuan, an increase of 22,420,145 yuan compared to the previous year. This is also China's most serious problem. Although Annam grain imports decreased last year, they still amounted to 3,252,975 yuan. Coal also still amounted to 2,717,670 yuan. A list of Annam's important imports is listed below: Rice, grains, coal, cement, medicinal materials and spices, dried shrimp, sundries, salted fish, cotton, rubber, paint, leather goods, wood, dried fish, smoked fish, glue and rosin, and others. The total imports to China last year were 59,973,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports to Vietnam</p>
<p>China's exports to Annam are mainly silk, which also increased last year. Secondary items include metal ores, tea and paper products, including silk, metal ores, paper, miscellaneous textiles, vegetables, fruits, piece goods, charcoal coal, tea, tobacco, sundries, and others. The total value of goods exported from China to Annam last year was 5,644,000 yuan. After offsetting imports and exports, China's trade deficit reached more than 50 million yuan. Although China has a trade surplus with France, when combined with Annam, China still has a trade surplus of over 30 million. Those concerned about international trade must pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Seamen's Party Headquarters Studies the Agenda of the International Labor Conference; The Seamen's Party Headquarters Special Commissioner's Office Orders Seamen's Organizations to Submit Reports by a Deadline</h3>
<p>The Office of the Special Commissioner for the Chinese Seamen's Party Affairs yesterday instructed various seamen's organizations that: "Regarding the agenda of the 20th International Labor Conference, which was previously copied and distributed to our office by the Central Department of Civil Training, it was ordered on February 21 of this year that all district departments and seamen's organizations should abide by it, study it separately, and submit reports within one week from the date of receipt of this document, so as to compile and submit them to the central government for reference. However, it has been a month and the reports from various districts and organizations have not been received. After this long period of time, it is assumed that the studies have been completed. Therefore, it is hereby re-ordered that all seamen's party departments and seamen's organizations in the Shanghai district must submit the results of their studies in writing to this office before the 23rd of this month. The district party departments in Hankou, Yichang, and other more distant areas must respond to this office before the 26th of this month. There must be no further delays. Furthermore, this office has repeatedly set deadlines for the submission of assigned tasks, but many districts have failed to complete them on schedule. It can be inferred that the work is delayed. You must pay attention to actively working in the future to promote party affairs and meet the requirements of the assessment. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3>The Tobacco Industry in the French Concession Requests Exemption from Paying Business and Sanitation Fees</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession received a report from the Second Branch of the Second District of the Citizens' Federation regarding the collection of fees from the tobacco industry by the Municipal Council and requested the Ratepayers Association to fight for justice. It has been learned that the original letter from the Ratepayers Association to the Municipal Council is as follows: According to a joint letter with the seals of ten tobacco shops, including Xinyutai, which specializes in selling Bing silk and does not sell other goods, the Municipal Council of the French Concession has been collecting tobacco fees on a monthly basis, and there are no other fees related to other types of tobacco. However, this year, the Municipal Council of the French Concession intends to collect classified business and sanitation fees from these shops, which is quite surprising. Upon investigation, the classified business and sanitation fee regulations only list the item "Tobacco Silk Warehouses" (with the note "Storage"). However, these shops are all retail stores and have no manufacturing facilities or storage areas. If the nature of the business is considered, these shops are actually the same as cigarette stores that sell cigarettes. Even larger cigarette stores also sell various types of Bing silk, such as raw silk, net silk, green leaf yellow tobacco, etc. Upon investigation, the aforementioned cigarette stores that also sell multiple types of tobacco do not have the name of classified business and sanitation fees. The situation of these shops is the same, but the scope is smaller, so there is no reason to pay classified business and sanitation fees. Therefore, we are submitting a statement of reasons, respectfully requesting you to forward it to the Municipal Council of the French Concession to achieve the purpose of canceling the aforementioned harsh taxes. We await your reply so that we can inform them.</p>

<h3>The Qingpu-Shanghai Highway is Temporarily Open to Traffic. A Short-Term Contract Has Been Signed with China Motor Company to Operate. The Ticket Price is 1.20 Yuan Per Person.</h3>
<p>Since the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway was completed, the public buses of the Qingpu-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company have not yet been completed. Therefore, a short-term contract has been signed with the China Motor Company on Malan Road to temporarily operate passenger cars between Shanghai and Qingpu. The ticket price is 1.20 yuan per person. A reporter from Central News Agency drove to inspect the entire route yesterday. The entire route starts from the Hongqiao Airport and goes directly to Zhongshan Park in Qingpu City, taking only 30 minutes. The entire road is relatively flat, but the road surface is too narrow, and it is very cramped for two cars to pass each other. There are a total of 22 bridges on the entire route, and 5 or 6 of them are quite high, which is too vertical, making driving on them slightly dangerous. The Qingpu-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company originally planned to hold a opening ceremony on April 1st and operate public buses with a ticket price of 80 cents per person. It is reported that the Shanghai terminus of the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway is adjacent to Hongqiao Airport, so it needs to be moved one kilometer south, and the relocation is currently being planned. It is feared that it will be difficult to open to traffic on schedule at that time.</p>

<h3>The Robber Jin Linfu Sentenced to Ten Years. Yang Sanguo Acquitted.</h3>
<p>The robbers Jin Linfu and Yang Sanguo, in January of this year, armed with weapons, went to Ruifuli on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession and attempted to rob Chen Jialin, who lived at No. 58 in the neighborhood, but failed.

They were arrested by the patrolmen and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Later, the French Police Department ordered detectives to bring the two robbers back, summoned the victims, and sent them to the Second Special Court. The Police Department prosecuted them for robbery and attempted murder. When questioned, the two defendants admitted that they had attempted to rob but failed, and that it was true that they had fired shots to resist arrest.

<h3>The Hearing on the Case of Shen Yanling's Divorced Concubine Suing for a Meeting with Her Children Was Concluded. The Verdict Is Scheduled to Be Announced on the 25th.</h3>
<p>Shen Yanling, a native of Wuxian who resides at No. 243 Gordon Road in West Shanghai, entrusted the care of his three sons born to his divorced concubine, Cheng Yuzhen, to his wife for several years and did not allow Ms. Cheng to see them, seemingly wanting to sever the relationship between mother and sons. Ms. Cheng, therefore, filed a lawsuit against Shen Yanling in the First Special District Court through a lawyer, requesting that she be allowed to meet her sons three times a month. After Judge Peng summoned and interrogated the parties, because there were still some points in the case that needed further investigation, the verdict was not announced as scheduled. On Saturday morning, Judge Peng reopened the court, and the lawyers of the plaintiff and defendant re-argued the case. The court ordered that the verdict be announced on the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3>Swedish Movie Star Warner Oland Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Actor Who Played Chinese Detective Charlie Chan Will Travel to Beiping and Qinhuangdao on the 27th</p>
<p>According to the Bi Dong News Agency, following Charlie Chaplin, another Hollywood star, Warner Oland, who specializes in playing the Chinese detective Charlie Chan, arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday with his wife, Edith Shearn, and a secretary. Because the Changxing Company's Asia Empress arrived an hour and a half earlier than announced, only a few people went to the port to welcome them. When the Far East representative of Fox Company went to the Gonghexiang Wharf to shoot a newsreel, Oland and his wife were already preparing to go to the Cathay Hotel to rest. Oland met with reporters from the Sino-Foreign News Agency at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon and gave a speech, saying that he would travel to Nanjing, Tianjin, and Beiping within a few days.</p>
<p>Few Welcomers Due to Early Arrival of Ship</p>
<p>After the news of Warner Oland-Charlie Chan's Eastern tour was released, movie fans in general were looking forward to it as they had been when Charlie Chaplin arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, due to the tide, the Asia Empress arrived at Gonghexiang Wharf at 12:00 noon, an hour and a half earlier than the forecast of 1:30 PM. Because the Central Supervisory Committee's Dr. Wang Liang also arrived at the Zhaoshang North Wharf on the Italian mail ship Victoria at 11:30 AM that morning, the Sino-Foreign press reporters were unable to take photos due to time constraints. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency boarded the Asia Empress at 12:30 PM to look for the "Great Chinese Detective." He learned that he was staying in Room 146 and went straight to his destination, but the detective was nowhere to be found. He hurriedly asked the servants, who said that he had gone to the deck to rest. He then remembered the scene when Charlie Chaplin arrived in Shanghai and hid from reporters on the deck, and thought that Charlie Chan might have read about it in the newspapers and was imitating him to play a trick to fool the reporters. So he rushed to the deck to look for him.</p>
<p>Hidden in the Large Dining Room, Munching on Toast</p>
<p>However, Chan was nowhere to be seen. Not only was there no trace of Charlie Chan, but there was also no one from the Chinese and foreign media present. So he returned to the old place and asked the tea room attendants, who said that he was in the large dining room munching on milk toast. It was almost noon, and Mr. Chan was preparing to have lunch on the ship before going ashore to rest. The reporter was worried that Oland had already gone to the hotel to rest and was feeling uneasy when he met a receptionist from the Cathay Hotel, who confirmed that Oland had not yet come ashore. So he stood at the pier and waited.</p>
<h3>Shanghai International Exhibition Seeks Participation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Site Located at the End of Yangshupu Road, Covering an Area of 200 Acres</p>
<p>Scheduled to Open Officially on July 1st</p>
<p>For the purpose of prospering the market and promoting international trade, Chinese and foreign people in this city have organized the Shanghai International Exhibition. The exhibition site is located on Yangshupu Road, covering an area of more than 200 acres. It is scheduled to open on July 1st. The preparatory office of the exhibition has sent letters to various factories and businesses seeking participation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Objectives</p>
<p>The organizational objective of the exhibition is to promote international trade. Shanghai has been a port for 95 years, and this is the first international exhibition. It is a good opportunity for Chinese national goods to attract foreign customers and expand sales. It is also possible to inspect the exquisite goods of other countries to serve as a model for improvement. The exhibition site is located on Yangshupu Road, on the banks of the Huangpu River, covering an area of more than 200 acres, about 2 million square feet, with convenient land and water transportation. All construction at the exhibition site is actively underway, and it is scheduled to open on July 1st and close in September.</p>
<p>Seeking Participation</p>
<p>The preparatory committee has been receiving a steady stream of letters and telegrams from merchants from various countries to discuss displays. At the same time, it is sending letters to various factories and businesses in this city seeking participation. Anyone with the following qualifications may participate in the exhibition: Manufacturers and producers from all over the world; import and export merchants or merchant factories or representatives of merchants or merchant organizations; various economic or travel organizations related to commerce; and various cultural institutions. Those who wish to participate can contact the preparatory committee of the Shanghai International Exhibition at No. 356 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Opinions of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>A reporter from New New News Agency met with Qian Chengxu of the General Chamber of Commerce of China yesterday and asked whether the Shanghai International Exhibition and the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition were the same organization. He replied that he had heard that the former was presided over by a Dutch merchant, and its location was at the old site of Shenxin No. 9 Factory on Yangshupu. Reading the English letterhead, it listed Guo Bingwen, Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, and Miao Zhongxi as sponsors. The Chamber of Commerce received a brief invitation from the exhibition on the 20th of this month. At the same time, it investigated the sponsors listed on the letterhead and found that they were not fictitious. Therefore, it has attached its name as a sponsor. As for the organization of the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, about two months ago, Mr. Millington, the manager of the Millington Advertising Company, a Shanghai foreign merchant, visited the Chamber of Commerce and showed a plan for displaying national goods to build Chinese-foreign commercial relations. After consideration, it was considered that the status of sponsor was not related to the organization itself, and its opening was in June next year. Therefore, he only allowed it to be a sponsor in the future. According to the company, the location is at the Shanghai Racecourse. In short, the Chamber of Commerce, in the position of a group, if its goal is proper and the participants are domestic celebrities, it can attach its name to it and assist it at any time to connect international emotions.</p>
<h3>Municipal People's Education Center: Kite Competition Finals Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over Two Thousand Spectators; Winning Competitors Announced</p>
<p>The Municipal People's Education Center, located on Wenmiao Road, held the second annual kite competition finals yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Shanghai Middle School playground in Wujia Lane, Hu-Min Road. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, also performed a kite demonstration. The number of spectators was extremely high. The Datong News Agency reporter records the details as follows:</p>
<p>Competing Kites</p>
<p>After the preliminary kite competition was held in the lecture hall the day before yesterday, the results of the selection yielded twenty-eight qualified kites. However, yesterday morning, there were also fifteen people who temporarily requested to participate in the performance, bringing the total number of kites to forty-three.

The competition began at 3:00 PM. First, Long Yingjie, director of the Recreation Group of the People's Education Center, reported on the significance of promoting healthy games. Then, Chu Minyi, on behalf of Gu Shunhua, gave a speech encouraging the participants. After the speech, the competitors slowly launched their kites. There were many types of kites, and the shapes were different. They flew sinuously, and in a moment, they entered the clouds, which was a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's Performance</p>
<p>The competition ended at 4:40 PM, and the kites were slowly pulled back. At this time, Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, arrived at the scene and brought three types of kites: butterfly, cicada, and eagle. Mr. Chu personally performed the demonstrations in sequence, waving his hands and watching, and the posture of letting go was extremely beautiful. By the time Mr. Chu finished the performance and put down the kites, it was already past 5:00 PM, so everyone happily went home.</p>
<p>Awarding the Winners</p>
<p>At that time, the final results were judged by four judges: Chu Minyi, Zhang Yunqing, Zhang Shuzhen, and Li Ziyang, based on the two items of height and stability. The top five kites were awarded a specially made silver cup each by the center. The remaining participating kites were also given a commemorative medal to encourage them.

<h3>China Oil Lamp Company: Founding Plant Oil Lamps</h3>
<p>Resisting Imported Kerosene; Economical and Safe; All Domestic Plant Oils Can Be Used</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Ling, a native of Guangdong, has studied in France for many years and has a deep scientific background. Witnessing the difficulties of the times, he devoted his intelligence to research and experimentation, and finally invented the plant oil lamp that is popular throughout the country today. Its structure is completely based on scientific principles and refined, and all kinds of domestic plant oils can be used. The light is bright, even better than foreign lamps, and it saves oil, avoids fires, and has no toxic fumes. It can be said to have all the advantages of economy, safety, and hygiene. Its impact is to actively resist imported kerosene, prevent huge amounts of money from flowing out of the country, and on the passive side, to burn domestic oils and increase agricultural production. If a national war breaks out and the source of kerosene is cut off, domestic plant oils will be everywhere, so there is no need to worry about the lack of fuel. It has been approved and rewarded by the Ministry of Industry and has been granted a patent. His friends Chen Zuyi, Yao Shoukang, Ding Tingbiao, Zhong Hanli, Liao Fuya, Lu Jiyin, Xiao賀昌 et al., believe that the plant oil lamp invented by Zhong Ling is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so they decided to prepare a company, open a factory to manufacture, and invited Chen Gongbo, Wei Huai, Lu Chao and other gentlemen to jointly launch the organization of the company, in order to proceed. Chen Zuyi was appointed as the director of preparation, and No. 218 Shandong Road, Shanghai, was selected as the location of the company. The capital amount was set at 150,000 national currency, and nearly half of it has been raised after a short period of recruitment. On the one hand, it has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, and has been approved, and on the other hand, a factory has been set up in Huade Road to manufacture. All management and transportation are carried out using scientific methods, in an orderly manner. The current products include wall lamps, table lamps, and glass lamps, which are of excellent quality and beautiful in style. (It is said that oil stoves and hanging lamps will be added in the future.) Under the rapid rotation of the spindle, thousands of lamps can be produced every day. At present, due to the high freight cost for transporting them to distant provinces, in order to reduce the consumption of customers, it is planned to set up branch factories in Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and North China, which are currently under preparation. However, the North China branch factory has now been established and can deliver goods next month, with a daily output of 6,000 lamps. Wind and rain lamps will also be manufactured in the branch factory. Jiangxi Province has also recently organized a cooperative to promote the sale of Chinese oil lamps, and Chairman Xiong has sent staff to preside over the matter, which is also to promote domestic products. The governments of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have also exempted local consumption taxes to encourage them, and central figures such as Chairman Lin, Wu Zhihui, and Huang Yingbai have either visited or requested lamps to test and burn them, and they have all praised them. At present, the manager's offices have been set up throughout the country, as well as in the Nanyang Islands, Annam, and India. The factory's shipments are almost in short supply. The company also believes that various vegetable oils in China already have their own sales channels on weekdays. Once the demand increases sharply, the price of oil will be affected. Therefore, it has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to issue a notice to the whole country to plant oil seedlings extensively, in order to increase oil production and keep oil prices low. It was approved by Circular No. 02055 and has been distributed to various provinces for planting. The company has also requested the National Economic Commission to issue a notice to silkworm farms to adopt oil lamps, in order to improve the results of silkworm rearing. It has also agreed to issue a notice.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Sends Members to Prisons to Lecture on Buddhism</h3>
<p>To Transform Their Psychology and Cross to the Other Shore Together</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that Hu Renqing, the warden of the Second Jiangsu Prison in this city, believes that the education of prisoners is highly valued in civilized countries. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued a notice to prison wardens in various provinces and cities to invite local philanthropists and Buddhists to give lectures on a weekly basis to transform them. Therefore, he sent a letter to layman Wang Yiting, the managing director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, requesting him to appoint a Dharma master to come to the prison to lecture on Buddhism, so that they can cross to the other shore together. It is heard that the Chinese Buddhist Association believes that the number of prisoners in the prison is the largest in the country, and it is important to spread Buddhism and transform their psychology. It has been decided to recommend Zhong Kanghou to preside over the matter, and to convene Dharma masters and laymen to give lectures at any time.</p>
<h3>Lu Yongsheng Beates a Thief to Death</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Ten Months in Prison</p>
<p>A thief, named Jia, around the age of thirty, stole a quilt that a rural woman, Shen, had spread out to dry on wasteland near Jinji Bridge Village in the French Concession last month. It was said that Jia had just been released from Caohejing Prison after serving his sentence, and was driven by hunger. When he was discovered and pursued by the victim, the thief fled along Xujiahui Road, and it happened that Lu Yongsheng, a local resident of No. 1073 Xujiahui Road, forty-six years old, who was usually a foreman in the Public Works Department, was returning home after work and saw the thief running towards him. Because his own home had also been stolen from many times, Lu hated the thief to the bone. Seeing the thief coming, he stepped forward, grabbed him, and beat him severely, causing the thief to fall to the ground injured and die. Later, the detectives arrived, arrested Lu, and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue. After examination by the prosecutor, it was confirmed that the thief had died from injuries sustained from the beating. Since no family members could be found, the morgue prepared a coffin. Lu was handed over to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After repeated trials, it was announced that the debate was over. The other day, Judge Li Changnian brought Lu Yongsheng to trial. Lu Yongsheng was sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment for injuring a person to death.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Datuan Town, Pudong; Bandits Punished</h3>
<p>Zhang and Wang Each Sentenced to Twelve Years</p>
<p>Fang Guichang, a farmer in the countryside of Datuan Town, Fengxian County, Pudong, had a wealthy family and owned a lot of land, which attracted the attention of bandits. On November 12th of last year, they gathered a crowd, carried weapons, broke into the house, and looted clothes and silver dollars, worth more than one hundred yuan. Before leaving, they also kidnapped Fang Guichang's twelve-year-old grandson, Fang Degen, and hid him in the firewood room of Song Zhangsheng's house in Liujia Wuhu, Beisong Township, Fengxian County, to demand a ransom. Fang Guichang received many letters from the bandits, as many as eight, demanding a price of 24,000 yuan, which was finally reduced to 1,400 yuan. It was also stated that if there was no sincerity in contacting negotiations, they would decide to tear up the ticket. Fang Guichang was greatly frightened when he received the news, and reported to various police agencies, requesting investigation and rescue. Last month, the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau successively arrested six kidnappers in the case, including Yang Huangjin and Zhang Linfa, and rescued the hostage Fang Degen. They were handed over to the procuratorate of the local court for interrogation, and a public prosecution was filed. The other day, Judge Wu Xiangzu came to the court to publicly try the case and announced the verdict. Fang Hongsheng, Yang Huangjin, and Zhang Linfa were all sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly committing robbery and kidnapping for ransom, and were deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhang Kejin and Wang Genfu, two offenders, jointly committed robbery and kidnapping for ransom, and were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. Song Tangsheng was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for helping to intend to kidnap for ransom and kidnapping, and was returned to prison to await instructions after the judgment.</p>
<h3>Wang Linbao and Others Accumulated Stolen Goods Worth Over Ten Thousands of Gold</h3>
<p>Dozens of Burglaries in the International Settlement</p>
<p>Lu Kunshui, the owner of the Lutianbao Silver Shop in Daqing Bridge and his partner Sun Guoquan, were arrested by French police detectives Xu Peichun and Bao detective Xue Youlin for receiving stolen goods from Wang Linbao and others and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. Later, Detective Xu successfully captured Wang's accomplices Liu Guobing and Dai Fuxing, who confessed to having stolen gold and silver jewelry from more than twenty homes. All the silver jewelry was sold to Lutianbao Silver Shop and Sun Buyun's house. After repeated trials by the Second Special Court, it was announced that the debate was over and a date was set for sentencing. The other day, when the defendants were brought to court for sentencing, the police lawyer claimed that the police had captured Wang's accomplice Wang Dashizi. He confessed that he was from Jiangbei, nineteen years old, and was previously a leather worker. He was recruited by Wang Linbao to steal from more than ten homes. All the silver jewelry was sold to Lutianbao Silver Shop. He didn't know they were thieves the first time, but the second time the people who sold the goods said they were stolen, totaling more than ten thousand gold. There were also dozens of burglaries in the Public Concession. Subsequently, British police detective Shi Ruixiang surrendered himself, requesting permission to transfer Wang et al. and the receivers of stolen goods for interrogation. However, Sun Buyun, one of the receivers of stolen goods, was not present due to illness. Judge Wang instructed that the case be re-examined on the 28th, and the defendants were returned to prison.</p>
<h3>Xie Yibin's Family Troubles Are Many</h3>
<p>Sons and Daughters-in-Law Repeatedly Disobeying Their Stepmother, Xie Zheng, Accuses Them of Defamation</p>
<p>Xie Yibin, a comprador of the Chaozhou people at Meizuishi Foreign Company on Jiujiang Road, remarried Zheng Qingqi as his successor after his wife passed away early, leaving behind many children, to take charge of the family. Unexpectedly, after Zheng took care of the marriage of the children of the previous wife, family conflicts arose, leading to several lawsuits in court. Since Zheng married Xie Yibin, she had given birth to a daughter and raised a foster son to relieve her loneliness. The children of the previous wife were quite dutiful to Zheng before they got married, and the siblings were also very harmonious. After each son married a daughter-in-law, they changed their attitude and regarded Zheng's children as thorns in their side. In three months, they plotted to kill Zheng's daughter. After the incident, the daughters-in-law also fled in fear of punishment. Zheng filed a complaint, and the Shanghai Local Court issued a warrant for arrest, but they were nowhere to be found. Xie's third son, Guoquan, passed away early, and the fourth son, Guozhen, was quite filial to Zheng. After marrying Zhou Huichang as his daughter-in-law, he listened to his wife and also changed his attitude. At that time, Xie Yibin was suffering from blindness, and he had temporarily entrusted the keys to the safe and the family property to Guozhen for safekeeping. Zheng had also deposited 1,500 yuan of her private savings and valuable jewelry with Zhou for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, Guozhen and his wife took the opportunity to embezzle them, and abused their elders, and moved out on their own. Zheng then reported to the police and filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court. After interrogation, Guozhen was sentenced to a fine of 50 yuan for injury, with a two-year suspended sentence. Therefore, Guozhen hated his stepmother even more, colluding with the former maid She to accuse Xie Yibin of confirming his identity, and during the court hearing, Guoquan's wife, Zheng (same surname), falsely accused Zheng of being her father and son's concubine. Therefore, Zheng felt that her daughters-in-law had repaid kindness with hatred, and she was unable to seek redress. She attempted suicide several times, but was rescued. Therefore, Zheng filed another criminal lawsuit against her daughter-in-law, Xie Zheng, for defamation in the First Special Court. After several summons, the defendant fled elsewhere and could not be summoned, and the court ordered a temporary suspension of the trial.</p>
<h3>Gen Tai Factory Lawsuit Intricacies; Cheng Yize Has No Relationship</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff's Application to Withdraw the Lawsuit Has Been Approved by the Court</p>
<p>Gen Tai Hehe Powder Factory, due to heavy debt, suddenly leased the factory to Hu Xiannan last year for operation. On the original brand name, the words "Yi Ji" were added. Later, the creditors of the factory, Siming Bank, learned that the factory owed more than 74,800 yuan in overdrafts, which had not been repaid for a long time. They leased the factory number privately, which was illegal. They filed a lawsuit against the factory owner Cheng Linsheng, Cheng's nephew Yize, manager Li Quanshen, and Hu Xiannan, claiming that they had changed their property and hindered their creditor's rights, and requested that the false lease contract signed by the defendants be declared invalid. The added word "Yi Ji" should be revoked, so that the original property of the first defendant would not be colluded and concealed, so that the plaintiff would not be in danger of creditor's rights. The First Special District Local Court had opened a court once. Cheng Linlin extended Tang Mingshi's lawyer's defense, saying that this lease did not hinder creditor's rights. Cheng Yize appointed Chen Zhen's lawyer, stating that he was not a shareholder of Gen Tai and was mistakenly implicated. The court then instructed to investigate and verify the case. Now, after the plaintiff, Siming Bank, investigated, it was determined that Gen Tai was indeed opened by Cheng Linsheng, and the lease was also done by Linsheng and his manager Li Quanshen. Cheng Yize was not a shareholder and had no relationship to the lease. He filed a statement stating the misunderstanding of suing Yize, and requested that the part of the lawsuit against Cheng Yize be withdrawn. After review by the trial judge, the decision was approved yesterday. As for the three defendants, Cheng Linsheng, Li Quanshen, and Hu Xiannan, they will still be summoned for trial at a later date.</p>

<h3>Villager Seeking Livelihood Encounters Swindler; Trusting Uncle Huang with Chicks, Attempting to Steal Chicks but Losing Money</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, a man was crying on Xinmin Road, Zhabei. Onlookers gave him silver coins and copper coins. After inquiring, it was learned that the man's name was Shen Xiaoqi, a villager from outside Suzhou's 阊门 (Changmen) Gate. Villagers call him Shen Xiaokui. He is thirty-seven years old. Last winter, Xiaokui had come to Shanghai to seek a livelihood but failed. He took a train home. On the train, he met an old man with white hair, about sixty-two years old, and they chatted very harmoniously. Xiaokui told him about his efforts to seek a livelihood in Shanghai. The old man claimed to be surnamed Huang, so he was called Uncle Huang. He was working as an assistant accountant in a factory in Shanghai. Xiaokui then asked Uncle Huang to find him a job. When the train arrived at Suzhou's Guanqianli Station, the two got off the train together and went to Xiaokui's house for dinner. They stayed overnight, and the next morning, Uncle Huang left. Before leaving, he told Xiaokui that if there were vacancies for tea attendants in the factory after he returned to Shanghai, he would write to his family and invite them to Shanghai. Shen believed it to be true. The previous Saturday, he received a letter from Huang, signed Huang Shoucheng, saying that there was a foreman vacancy in his factory, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan, and an extra ten yuan or so. However, there were still chief accountants and managers in the factory, so a little bit of socializing fee of twenty to thirty yuan was needed. After receiving the letter, Xiaokui was overjoyed to have such a good job, so he borrowed thirty yuan in legal tender from relatives and friends, and brought a package to Shanghai yesterday, to meet at a certain tea house on Beijing Road. When he arrived, Uncle Huang was already there. When they met, they were extremely friendly. Xiaokui gave the socializing fee of thirty yuan in legal tender. Huang took him to a certain teahouse in the Buxianqiao area of the French Concession to wait. Not long after, a chief accountant, Mr. Zhang, arrived, talked a few words, and Zhang led Xiaokui to see the manager. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly disappeared halfway. Because Xiaokui was unfamiliar with the area, he couldn't find him for a while. When he returned to the tea house, Huang was also gone. He then realized he had been swindled. The package he was carrying, containing short shirts and pants, had been swindled away. Because he had no relatives or friends in Shanghai, he couldn't go home.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Guangyuan County Asks for Disaster Relief Due to Banditry</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Sichuan Guangyuan County Charity Association reads: "Respectfully to all newspapers, we humbly submit that our Guangyuan is a mountainous area, historically known for its hardship. Since the founding of the Republic [of China], internal strife has been rampant. Our county is bordered by the provinces of Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu, and the constant movement of troops has exhausted the people with corvée labor. Later, warlords carved up the territory, extorting hundreds of thousands in military funds, compounded by corrupt local bullies who practiced layer upon layer of exploitation. The people had long been exhausted and at their wit's end, feeling as though there was no hope for survival. Unexpectedly, in the winter of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], the bandits of Sichuan invaded, Guangyuan was captured and recaptured three times over several years. The burning, killing, and plundering during this time were too numerous to describe. Fortunately, in the summer of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], our Central government's various divisions, together with the anti-bandit armies of this province, jointly suppressed the bandits, and the lost territories were gradually recovered. The people who had fled gradually returned. However, the autumn grain sowing season had already passed. Although they勉 try to plant, most of the crops were秀而不实. Autumn approaching, the government conscripted laborers to build fortifications and roads with utmost urgency. Before the work was completed, the food was already consumed. Now they have exhausted all edible葛根 tree roots and stripped all edible wild vegetables and fresh grass. The strong beg for food in all directions, while the weak die on the roads. The sight of abandoned children crying along the way is unbearable to hear. Moreover,抢食物之人 constantly emerge from villages and towns, surrendering themselves to the law, thinking there is糧食可食. The severity of the famine is imaginable. Fortunately, the military and political officials stationed in Guangyuan are promoting donations for relief, setting up shelters to care for children and hiring workers to bury corpses. However, the number of those seeking food and those dying of starvation is increasing daily, and it is impossible to sustain this with limited financial resources. The disaster-stricken people desperately need help. With our limited capabilities, we have repeatedly considered and can only beseech our military and political authorities and charitable philanthropists to show compassion and contribute generously. If you are willing to provide substantial funds for relief, please remit them to our county's Relief Sub-Association, so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims can celebrate their revival. Your kindness would be akin to rebirth. We earnestly submit this plea and implore your attention. The Guangyuan County Charity Association, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, kowtows respectfully."</p>

<h3>Jottings</h3>
<p>— (Zhou Xusheng)</p>
<p>To make one's life meaningful and valuable, one must go to the social organizations and do everything, no matter how big or small, that is truly needed.</p>
<p>If we work hard in the right way, we can contribute one point of effort, which can transform into one point of experience. Therefore, the factor of success is the sum of each point of effort.</p>
<p>The pain of being bullied is never as bad as the danger of deceiving oneself.</p>
<p>"The world is cursed, but if you only complain about the world, then the most cursed is yourself." After being warned by the above words, how should we strive to fulfill our responsibilities to the world!</p>
<p>Facing a mirror, we can clearly see the dirt on our faces, but the darkness of society, the treachery of affairs, and the insidiousness of people's hearts, what method can we use to see through them clearly?</p>
<h3>From Zhaoguan to Huansha Creek</h3>
<p>— Zhan Ruoye</p>
<p>Because of Wu Zixu's plea for troops, a well-known and significant place was created in history, and that is Zhaoguan. When Wu Yuan entered Wu through Jian Guan, he passed through Liyang (now He County), and begged for food from a silk-washing girl. The girl was ashamed, and threw herself into the creek to die. Later generations were touched by her chastity and martyrdom, and a shrine was built to worship her. This is the current Huansha Creek.</p>
<p>Zhaoguan is located outside the west gate of Hanshan County, twenty miles outside the city. The only means of transportation for this forty-mile round trip is a few donkeys. Zhaoguan is nestled among thousands of mountains, and the scenery is very majestic. The mountains overlap, with only this one pass, and there is nothing around it. Perhaps because the mountains are relatively high, Zhaoguan is contrasted as being so short and dark. Looking at it from a distance, it is even a little crooked! Seeing this, it is as if you are in a medieval ancient city, and a nostalgic feeling, no, an indescribable emotion, lingers in your heart. In this way, it can make you more convinced of the ancient saying that "a mud ball can seal Hangu Pass."</p>
<p>The Huansha Temple is in He County, but now it has become a nunnery. Its great name is not widely known to the locals, and its desolation is evident. When I went to explore this historical site with passionate emotions, I returned with a sense of disappointment. Readers, please don't use the fantasy of Ruoye Creek under Luoshan Mountain to read this Huansha Creek! It turns out that the so-called creek is just a pool of green water, without trees or mountains. The background is a row of earthen walls and several vegetable plots, that's all. And the impression it gave me was emptiness. Such a place has betrayed this beautiful place name with its rich poetic meaning.</p>
<h3>Distributing Rice</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yun Xun</p>
<p>The sages have two maxims: "For every grain of rice and every bowl of porridge, one should think of how hard it was to obtain!" In reality, among the large group of people who eat rice and porridge, how many can truly comprehend the meaning of these two sentences? It's no wonder, friends who are well-fed and clothed only know to "open their mouths when food comes" and "close their eyes when sleep comes." Who would think about maxims or anything else? Now there are two clear proofs that cannot be glossed over: in the crowded porridge distribution centers, one must "eat the whip first, then the porridge!" Every grain that enters the mouth is truly hard-earned. Without a desperate struggle and the efforts of the porridge distribution staff to maintain order, one cannot even hope to get half a spoonful of rice soup. "Eat the whip first, then the porridge!" is not just a descriptive phrase. There is also "Distributing Rice." Although this term is unfamiliar, anyone who has been a passenger on a river steamer once or twice will immediately recall the scene of "Distributing Rice." For example, on the Xiaochangjiang steamboats running the Shanghai-Yangzhou line, so-called steerage passengers pay less than one yuan in French currency for a journey of hundreds of miles, including the cost of meals. Although this is not exactly "charity," it can be considered a semi-charitable convenience provided to the common people by the company's management. Every time it comes to "Distributing Rice," a pair of bamboo chopsticks and a rough porcelain bowl are given. The bowl is neither Jingdezhen nor Yixing; perhaps it can be selected for an exposition in a thousand years! From afar, you can see the steaming yellow rice being carried out, basket by basket, by several junior boat crew members. This group of hungry tigers and eagles rush forward to grab it. It's more of a snatch than a distribution. This intense commotion is certainly greater than at the entrance of a porridge distribution center. Each person squats and swallows, while guarding against the small bundle under their buttocks being stolen. This tense atmosphere where hands, feet, ears, and eyes are all in use is a sight that eighteen painters could not capture. This coarse rice, naturally, even the dogs raised in wealthy families would not want to eat it, but for them, they can finish several bowls, as if eating delicacies. What do they eat with it? Four copper coins' worth of greens, or a bowl of vermicelli with fried tofu. At this time, the crying of children often creates a commotion. The women eat while humming lullabies, rocking their babies to sleep. What is called hell on earth? This is a miniature of it. They originally wanted to enter the metropolis to scrape together a living, but the metropolis is broken and withered, and they can't find a rice bowl. Before they even step onto the docks of the metropolis, they are given a preview. This scene of distributing and snatching rice probably symbolizes the difficulty of finding food in the metropolis.</p>
<h3>Spring City, Flowers Fly Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Lin Haozuo</p>
<h3>Xiaoxitian</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Love for Beauty Outweighs Duty; Worthy Men Cast Themselves into the Wilderness</p>
<p>Zhou Yourong interjected with a laugh: "That's still not as good as me. My heart is strong, and my flesh is also strong. A strong heart means not accepting the complaints of the common people. Strong flesh means being able to endure the whip." Zhiqian laughed and said: "County Magistrate Zhou is grumbling again." Yourong said: "If it weren't for my wife being alone in Xi'an, I would have followed you all to the west. My purpose is different, I just want to go to Dunhuang to see some things." Zhuoran shook his head with a smile and said: "County Magistrate Zhou is still obsessed with the idea that a stone treasure chamber will yield texts? If there were any stone chamber documents, they would have been rummaged through until not even a scrap of paper remained. Would they still be waiting for us to search for them? However, speaking of Dunhuang County, it is an interesting place. Every street there is named after a county in Gansu, and the people who live on that street are from that county. Not only is the language that of that county, but the marriage customs are also maintained according to the customs of that county." Yourong laughed and said: "That's strange, why are the boundaries between the residents there so strictly divided?" Zhuoran said: "Dunhuang has always been a border county with no people. The people there are all transferred from various counties in Gansu to garrison. In other words, it is a miniature province of Gansu." Zhiqian clapped his hands and stood up and said: "I can go and see it on this trip to Xinjiang." Zhuoran said: "Going to Dihua does not pass through Dunhuang. However, to increase Mr. Cheng's interest, we can take a detour to Dunhuang to see it." The more Zhiqian heard this, the more excited he became. He laughed and said: "Others come to the Northwest because they are afraid of hardship, but my ideal is different. I feel that the more hardship I can endure, the more interest it will add." But I don't know when the two of you have decided to set off? Zhuoran said: "Because there are no more days, we came here to County Magistrate Zhou's place to ask Mr. Cheng to come and discuss. We plan to leave tomorrow morning, I don't know if Mr. Cheng can make it in time!" Zhiqian did not expect to travel so quickly, and unconsciously took two breaths, showing a hesitant look, and reached out and touched his waist twice. Shigong said: "If Mr. Cheng wants to extend it by half a day, it is also possible. Because we have agreed with a friend in Pingliang to meet there." (418)</p>

<h3>Japan's Death Penalty</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>In the past, Japan also practiced beheading and shooting, but now it mostly uses hanging. Generally, those who commit robbery and murder, arson and murder, or treason are likely to be sentenced to death. Very few people confess and are willing to serve their sentences after being sentenced to death in the first trial, and give up appealing. Most have to go through several appeals before being rejected and executed. In prison, death row inmates worry every time they hear the footsteps of the guards, asking if today is the day of execution. No matter what, the guards will not tell the death row inmates who cling to life the date of execution. They must take the death row inmate to the warden's office and read out "Today, according to the order of the Minister of Justice, the death penalty will be carried out" before the death row inmate knows that their death is imminent. At that time, handcuffs will be quickly added to prevent resistance. The evil prisoners who usually give up on themselves will change their expressions greatly at this time, their whole bodies trembling.</p>
<p>Next to the gallows, no one is willing to walk up on their own, and several people always have to carry them up by force. Crying, screaming, raging, calling for injustice, it can be said to be the most tragic moment in life. Only female prisoners rarely riot, except for crying. Next to the gallows is a Buddhist altar set up for the death row inmate to pray. In front of the Buddha are a few steamed buns and a cup of tea, provided for the death row inmate to eat before death. Some people eat these steamed buns, but their hands are already trembling so badly. The cup of tea is always spilled.</p>
<p>Former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce Councilor Yuta Ken was known for his composure at the time of execution. Because his rice business failed, he borrowed money from usurers, and could not repay it. He incited two students to beat the usurer to death with baseball bats, cut him into several pieces, put him in wooden boxes, and threw him into the water. Later, the matter was leaked, and this agricultural scholar and high-ranking official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce became a prisoner. When he was executed, he was calm, ate two steamed buns, drank a cup of tea, thanked the guards and the executioners, and then calmly stepped onto the stage. His sister knew the date of execution and sent a white vest, covered with the words "Namu Amida Butsu." She thought that wearing it during the execution could reduce suffering.</p>
<p>Except for political prisoners and special offenders, death row inmates all live in the same room, because they are afraid of suicide. Only the prisoner named Damai Longyun was imprisoned alone because he was so vicious that he robbed other people's food. He was a big thief who committed adultery, theft, murder, and arson. It is not known how many nuns in various parts of Japan were humiliated by him. Living in prison, he could not get enough to eat, so he forced the guards to buy bread and snacks. He had no money. The guards had no choice but to get his consent to sell his dead body in advance to a certain university as an anatomy specimen, earning 30 yen. Selling his future dead body to feed himself lavishly, I'm afraid Damai Longyun of Japan must be the first person to do so.</p>

<h3>Zhanzhan Records</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Ge)</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei once said: "Modern youth should have three basic conditions: the physical strength of a lion, the agility of a monkey, and the spirit of a camel." Everyone knows that this is a very valuable statement. Mr. Huang Renzhi's three conditions for the Chinese people also have the same value. He said: "China must have the spirit of Russia, the science of Germany, and the wealth of the United States. If these three things are combined, China will become strong without even trying."</p>
<p>There were two foreigners named Ma in history. One compared China to paradise, while the other compared China to hell. The former is Marco Polo's "Travels of Marco Polo," and the latter is Malthus's "Essay on the Principle of Population." Some people think that these two people's views are too extreme. In fact, if we observe society carefully, we can see that one side is paradise and the other side is hell.</p>
<h3>Imperial Kitchen Tofu</h3>
<p>— Zhe Cun</p>
<p>Song Muzhong's "Xipi Leigao" records the southern tour of the Qing Emperor Shengzu and commemorates the grand occasion of welcoming him during the tenure of the Jiangsu Governor. One day, a court eunuch bestowed food, saying that Song Luo was an old minister, different from other governors, and should be bestowed in the same manner as generals and governors. It also conveyed an imperial edict saying: "I have a daily tofu dish, the taste is unusual. Since Governor Song is an elderly man, let the imperial kitchen eunuch teach it to the governor's cook, so that he can enjoy it for the rest of his life." Liang Zhilin, Vice Minister of Fujian, once included it in his "Random Notes on Strange Tales," but regretted that the method was not passed on to outsiders. Later, he accidentally read "Suiyuan Shidan," which contained eight-treasure tofu, also a recipe given by the Qing Emperor Shengzu to Xu Jian'an, Minister of the Ministry of Rites. When the Minister obtained the recipe, the imperial kitchen spent one thousand taels of silver. The method is to cut tender tofu into small pieces, add fragrant mushroom powder, hemp mushroom powder, pine nut kernels, melon seed kernels, almond kernels, etc., and other ingredients such as shredded chicken, shredded ham, and diced bamboo shoots, stir-fry in thick chicken broth, and serve. Use a ladle instead of chopsticks to eat it. It is especially suitable for eating. This should be no different from the tofu given to Song Muzhong. I believe that with such a combination of cooking, any food should be delicious and palatable, not just tofu. It can also be seen that in the past, autocratic emperors indulged in extravagance with jade food in all directions.</p>

<h3>Inverse Law</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jun</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered a law: the younger the person, the bigger the ego; the older the person, the smaller the ego. If you don't believe me, listen to me:</p>
<p>The staff in the agency, such as junior clerks and assistant staff, all wear shiny badges of the XX Department XX Hall, hanging on their collars, looking very proud. As for the XX Director and XX Chief, they don't wear badges.</p>
<p>Students in provincial schools who have poor academic performance, bad character, and are in lower grades, or even students in cram schools, wear badges all day long. As for students who have good academic performance, good character, and are in higher grades, they don't wear badges.</p>
<p>Even people in society who have no knowledge and no cultivation talk eloquently and make ghosts and gods pale. As for people who have knowledge and cultivation, they never talk much.</p>
<h3>One Head Sleep and Two Head Sleep</h3>
<p>— Qian Meizhang</p>
<p>Husband and wife are clearly sleeping head-to-head, but it is called "one head sleep." On the contrary, sleeping head-to-toe is called "two head sleep." The logic is incomprehensible. I would like to ask dialectologists about this.</p>
<h3>European Customs Wedding Gifts</h3>
<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>According to European customs, when relatives and friends get married, they must continuously give wedding gifts up to sixteen times. Moreover, the time and materials are fixed, unlike our country, where gifts are only given at the time of marriage, and the quantity and quality of the gifts are all up to the giver. Now, I will record the time and materials of the European wedding gifts for readers.</p>
<p>The first year is called the "Paper Wedding," and gifts made of paper are given. The second year is called the "Grass Wedding," and gifts made of grass are given. The third year is called the "Sugar Wedding." The fourth year is called the "Leather Wedding." The fifth year is called the "Wood Wedding." The seventh year is called the "Flower Wedding." The tenth year is called the "Tin Wedding." The twelfth year is called the "Linen Wedding." The fifteenth year is called the "Crystal Wedding." The twentieth year is called the "Porcelain Wedding." The twenty-fifth year is called the "Silver Wedding." The thirtieth year is called the "Pearl Wedding." The thirty-fifth year is called the "Coral Wedding." The fortieth year is called the "Jade Wedding." The fiftieth year is called the "Gold Wedding." The seventy-fifth year is called the "Diamond Wedding." Based on the names of the paper, grass, sugar, leather, and wood weddings, gifts are made with their materials. The intention is nothing more than to take the meaning that the longer the marriage lasts, the stronger the love becomes. To use this as a blessing has a profound meaning. May those who become husband and wife in the morning and sigh at parting in the evening take note.</p>
<h3>The Human World</h3>
<p>The late American humorist Mark Twain said: "A person who is pessimistic before the age of forty-eight knows too much; a person who is optimistic after the age of forty-eight knows too little." This sentence is not "humorous," but rather has a very strong sense of sadness.</p>
<p>Is it really "most pitiable is the human world"? (Zi Ying)</p>

<h3>Xiqing Group A Volleyball, Haiqing vs. Russian Army Final, 7:15 PM Tonight in Xiqing, Haiqing Is Confident of Winning the Championship</h3>
<p>The Xiqing 8th Volleyball Group A League, the Haiqing vs. Xiqing match, has already been held ahead of schedule the night before last. The entire event is coming to an end. Only the Haiqing vs. Russian Army match remains tonight. The match will start at 7:15 PM. According to the Haiqing Association, they defeated the Russian Army by 3-0 in the first round, so Haiqing's victory in this match is very certain, and there should be no problem in winning the championship. However, if the Russian Army can win 3-0 against Haiqing, then the scores of the two teams will be equal, and a final match will be held. It is expected that tonight's battle will be a fierce fight. Yesterday, there were three games each in Group B's first and second divisions. Except for Yiyuan's 2-1 victory over the Jews, the rest were all 3-0. The results of each match are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Xilian Football Group B Tournament, Youyou B Thrashes Xishang, The Strength of Both Sides Is Considerable, the First Half Ends in a Draw, In Summary, Youyou Scores Three Goals in the Second Half for a Total of Four</h3>
<p>The Xilian Football Group B Tournament, Youyou B vs. Xishanghui, clashed at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Youyou has won the Preliminary and Initial Zi Lin Cups one after the other and is invincible. Although Xu Wenkui did not play yesterday, his strength is still considerable. The forwards Sun Hupei and Xi Qiaosheng are unusually fierce. The defender Zhang Rong is like a lone warrior who can make up for Zhu Qiu's shortcomings. The center defense line is slightly weak. Xishanghui also performed well. The five forwards cooperate skillfully, especially the left forward Mike Reid is an invaluable talent. The defender G. McLean is also considered experienced. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, Youyou scored three more goals, winning 4-1. Yesterday, fans were in awe of Youyou B's reputation, and thousands of people came to watch. The referee was Li Nuosi.</p>
<p>Youyou B: Wang Caigao, Zhang Rong, Zhu Qiu, Wang Zhangxian, Yan Lianjin, Shen Baigui, Sun Hupei, Xue Yongyuan, Hu Youcheng, Xi Qiaosheng, Cheng Yize. Xishang B: Lin Kelei, Mai Hang, G. McLean, Cairo, G. McLean, Diazelle, Macleod, Harris, Thompson, Abegley, Quison.</p>
<p>Reciprocity, Each Scores a Goal</p>
<p>After the start, Youyou Hu Youcheng passed the ball forward. Xi Qiaosheng assisted from the side. Xiaomengchang was on the frontier with his troops. The enemy general came to block, and before three or five passes, the enemy right inside forward Abegley had already penetrated deep into Youyou's territory. Fortunately, Zhang Rong's rescue was effective, and he passed the ball to the front. Sun Hupei went alone, rushing straight to the enemy territory. G. McLean blocked the ball. Macleod invaded from the left, hooked it in one kick, and Abegley lightly flicked it to the top of Mac's head. Wang Youcai jumped and pressed it down, turning the danger into safety. Soon, Xiaomengchang got the ball from Xue Yongyuan, dribbled to the baseline, and hooked it in the middle. Sun Hupei ambushed in secret, raised his foot and shot fiercely, and the record was opened. After losing the goal, Xishang attacked with all their might but failed to score many times. Macleod launched an attack again, quickly breaking through three passes. The ball was passed to Thompson, who swept it across, and Wang Caigao fell to the ground and missed, resulting in a tie. Before long, the first half ended without a winner.</p>
<p>4-1, Youyou Sings a Song of Victory</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, Xishang B was not as fierce as in the first half. Looking at Youyou, they were unusually active. The five forwards pounced fiercely on the enemy camp. Hu Youcheng and Xue Yongyuan cooperated well, knocking on the door several times, but were all saved by the enemy goalkeeper Lin Kelei. Xi Qiaosheng made waves, attracting the attention of the whole audience. Then, Yan Lianjin sent A Dou from afar. Qiaosheng went alone, dribbling and rushing into the penalty area, pulling the bow and firing the arrow, scoring a goal and returning. The enemy army was already one goal behind and planned to fight to the death. Fortunately, Zhang Rong stood guard alone, and the enemy could not succeed. Soon, Hu Youcheng got the ball in the middle, dribbled to the left, and hooked it towards the center. Xi Qiaosheng did not take credit for himself and passed it to Sun Hupei. Hupei shot, and the enemy general Diazelle actually betrayed, knocking the ball into the net. After this, Youyou's momentum was immense, and Sun Damau repeatedly made unexpected moves, but unfortunately failed to score. Then, with the help of Xue Yongyuan, he went straight to the enemy territory. Lin Kelei was unable to catch up in time, and Damau calmly sent the ball into the empty goal. Before long, time ran out, and Youyou won 4-1.</p>
<h3>Xilian Group B Tournament, Donghua B Loses to Lancashire, Donghua's Bad Luck, A Big Loss of 6-1, In the Group A Tournament Yesterday, Dongxin Forfeited to Youyou</h3>
<p>The Donghua Football Club originally had two matches scheduled yesterday, one for Group A and one for Group B. However, the Group A match was forfeited due to an incident, causing the Youyou team to get two points without laboring. Donghua Group B vs. Lancashire clashed at Yiyuan at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Donghua's luck was bad, and they lost five goals in a row in the first half. Although they only had ten players in the second half, they counterattacked vigorously. As a result, each team scored one goal, and the game ended 6-1. Victory belonged to Lancashire. The referee was Shen Huichun. The battle record is as follows.</p>
<p>Donghua Loses Five Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After the opening, Donghua fought facing the sun. After three or five passes, Turner attacked and scored a goal. In the next ten minutes, the ball hovered in front of the Hua goal. Fortunately, Chen and Zeng Yin saved the situation, but the ball entered the left side. Ferrins picked it up and sent it to the center. Burton caught up and kicked it in. Donghua lost two goals in a row and tried hard to resist, but the enemy's defense was as strong as gold, making it difficult to cross. Soon, the enemy army rolled in again. Donghua's right midfielder lost his footing and was hooked away from the baseline by Taylor Fozart. Burton headed it, and the record was opened again. Less than two minutes had passed since the previous goal was lost. In an instant, Donghua was besieged many times. The enemy's central, left, and right three forwards kicked wildly. Zeng Peifu did not catch the ball steadily and lost it. Burton flicked it slightly and it went into the net again. Donghua made a push into enemy territory once, and a decision ball was kicked. Pilon hooked it out but failed, and the overconfidence caused the ball to pass between his legs, losing a good opportunity. Soon, the enemy launched a full-scale attack again, with iron cavalry rumbling in front of the goal. Peifu rushed out to meet them, but Turner kicked the ball into the net corner in secret. Before long, lemon time had arrived, and Donghua lost five goals.</p>
<p>Lancashire Wins a Big Victory</p>
<p>In the second half, Zhou Zhi left the field due to injury. Donghua only had ten players to play, but they retreated and advanced, and the enemy cavalry could not succeed. After about twenty minutes, Turner attacked the goal, and Zeng Peifu was dealing with it, but Chen Dehui ran out diagonally and missed, giving the enemy a good opportunity. As a result, Taylor Fozart simply flicked it and lost another goal. Under the extreme threat of the enemy, Donghua counterattacked from the right. Zhu Jingen picked it up and sent it to the center, and Cao Qinfang kicked it into the net, avoiding eating an egg. Finally, Donghua was penalized two penalty kicks, both of which were saved by Peifu. As a result, the game ended 6-1. Donghua was defeated. Lancashire was originally one of the strong teams. After Lai Hu inherited Ennis in Shanghai, he made quite a lot of achievements. Its Group B strength can also be called average. Yesterday's match showed that the two defenders Panson and Pilon defended extremely well, making it difficult for Donghua to cross the line. The front line was also quite sharp. Donghua's defense was still good, but the center defense line was extremely weak. The five forwards also lacked attacking power, especially on the two wings, giving the enemy many opportunities. Moreover, their kicks were weak. In the second half, they had a penalty kick opportunity, but they missed it. The lineups of the two teams are as follows.</p>
<p>Lancashire: Laihua, Panson, Pilon, Huo Haiqin, Keweike, Balan, Ferrens, Taylor Fozart, William. Donghua B: Zeng Peifu, Chen Dehui, Yin Zhengda, Jin Jiabiao, Huang Ruihua, Zhang Jun, Zhou Zhi, Shu Shipin, Cao Qinfang, Wu Binghao, Zhu Jingen.</p>
<h3>Four-Mile Flatland Cross-Country Race: Uneven Grouping Leads to Chinese Runners Being Eliminated; All Three Spots Taken by Russians; Key Athletes Like Wang Zhengling Absent, Greatly Reducing Strength</h3>
<p>The four-mile open flatland cross-country race, organized by the Westerners' Athletic Association, was held at Hongkou Park yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. The race rules stipulated that the starting order would be determined based on the usual performance standards of each racer. Initially, there were 43 participants, but ten key athletes, including Wang Zhengling, Wu Wenlin, Ling Xuewen, Zhang Liang, Xu Yanbo, Pan Gongbao, and Lifu Qinggu, were absent at the last minute. However, 14 people requested to join at the last minute, so there were still 43 competitors. The rules stated that only the top three finishers would be selected, and all three places were taken by Russians. No Chinese runners were among the winners.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Start</p>
<p>As the time arrived, 43 athletes gathered in front of the dressing room inside the west gate of Hongkou Park. The starter, Mike Na, blew the whistle, and the two weakest competitors, He Dequi and Xia Honggeng, started first. Subsequently, a group was released every 30 seconds until 10:30:30 AM, when the last group was released.</p>
<p>Mid-Race Situation</p>
<p>This race's grouping was exceptionally balanced, which should have led to fierce competition. However, because the strength of the 14 late entrants was unpredictable, there was a momentary misjudgment, and Su Keer, Si Diu Qing Fa Fu, Na Wei Xue Fu, and Ge Lao Lai Fu were placed in the third group. After the start, the three of them showed their skills, leading the way. Our Chinese athletes, Gu Huiyuan, Zhou Ruquan, Liang Yaoting, Qiu Zongcheng, Niu Hongquan, Wan Jinsheng, Wang Rulin, Li Duan, and Ma Riji, started later and chased with all their might, but the gap was too large. The Russian athletes had already passed Dong Qiu Zongcheng. Niu Hongquan unleashed their swift strides, closely following and emerging from the crowd shoulder to shoulder. By the time they reached the Hongkou swimming pool, the rankings were largely determined.</p>
<p>Arrival Order</p>
<p>The first to reach the finish line was the Russian athlete Si Diu Qing Fa Fu, with a time of 21 minutes and 5 seconds. The second was Na Wei Yun Fu, followed by the customs officer Mai Han, 70 meters behind. Hai Er Zu Lai's final sprint secured third place. The fifth place was Lao Lai Fu, and the first Chinese runner was Liang Yaoting in sixth place. Subsequently, Niu Hongquan, Gu Huiyuan, Qiu Zongcheng, Hua Xu, Zhou Ruquan, Chen Zhiming, and others arrived in succession. The winners' medals will be awarded during the Mike Na Cup Sino-Western cross-country race to be held on April 5th.</p>

<h3>Little Men (Part Two) (Zero) (Eight)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>At that moment, Mr. March came over and stopped, saying a few words of comfort and encouragement, "My dear, you have already done your best to promote that good state. Continue to maintain your faith, your efforts, and the success of your small experiment will prove it is not in vain." This good man never lost his belief in humanity, still hoping to see peace, goodwill, and happiness fill the earth.</p>
<p>"Father, I don't have such extravagant hopes. I only wish to give these children a home where they can learn some simple qualities, so that when they enter the vast world to make their own way, their hardships may be reduced somewhat. Honesty, courage, diligence, faith in heaven, in people, and in themselves; that is what I strive for here."</p>
<p>"That is everything. Give them these aids, and then let them lead independent and honorable lives; no matter what success or setbacks they encounter, I think they will always remember and bless your efforts, my good son-in-law and good daughter."</p>
<p>At this time, the professor had already joined their group; as Mr. March spoke, he extended both hands, one to his son-in-law and one to his daughter, and when he looked at them, they felt immense comfort. Later, Shu and her husband stood side by side for a while, talking quietly, feeling that their "summer cultivation," having received the approval of that wise elder, must be very good.</p>

<p>Economic Publication</p>
<h3>The Trend of Soviet Economic Policy</h3>
<p>— Wei Yuan</p>
<p>Soviet economic policy has gone through several different methods. Generally speaking, it can be divided into four periods: First, from 1917 to 1921, the period of military communism; second, from 1921 to 1928, the period of the New Economic Policy; third, the first Five-Year Plan period; and fourth, the current second Five-Year Plan period.</p>
<p>During the first period, the Soviet government attempted to control the complete economic life of the country. Although this could not be fully implemented at all times and in all places, it was indeed an important motivation in the Soviet government's rule during this period.</p>
<p>The second period, the New Economic Policy period, differed from the first period in that it abandoned the principle of state economic control and monopoly that was practiced in the first period. The New Economic Policy was a dual system. On the one hand, the government retained control over almost all heavy industries, virtually the entire credit system, international trade, and transportation. On the other hand, it allowed farmers to cultivate their own land and trade freely.</p>
<p>During the third period, the government monopolized various products and trade, paying close attention to agriculture. The individual peasant system based on individuals was abolished and replaced by a collective system. The sale of agricultural products in the market was prohibited. Prices were fixed and unchangeable. Consumption was strictly limited. The government took control of the nation's production and distribution, and the authorities obtained huge amounts of grains and other agricultural products at fixed prices. From this point of view, the authorities were successful. However, the authorities were not successful in increasing or improving agricultural products, because private property was not allowed in collective farms, and farmers had to sell the surplus at low fixed prices. Another point is that the authorities could not eliminate the illegal free markets, because the prices in the free markets were several times higher than those set by the government.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the fourth period is that the government granted privileges to farmers. Once farmers delivered the portion stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to the government, the government allowed them to sell the remaining goods at high prices in the free market. In this way, it could somewhat compensate them for the losses they suffered from selling at fixed prices. Since January 1933, when collective farms were specially allowed to trade, the free market, except for a few restrictions, became legal again. From then on, in addition to state grain agencies distributing products to workers and employees at low fixed prices, the state and cooperative stores also had parallel development with trade far exceeding the unified system prices. Therefore, the price system naturally became increasingly chaotic. The Soviet ruble was not a standard of uniform value, and its purchasing power varied from place to place depending on local conditions. The level of nominal wages could no longer induce workers to increase production. Moreover, the government, based on past experience, had realized that universal distribution control was not only very uneconomical but also very difficult to handle. The government also understood that controlling supply was detrimental to agricultural development and the improvement of goods consumed the most. For the above reasons, the Soviet government abolished fixed price control supply and the fixed grain card system in January 1935, and created a uniform price level for each commodity.</p>
<p>During the first Five-Year Plan period, there was also a basic principle—that is, the "complete" collectivization of agriculture. The Soviet government also needed to reconsider this. Later, several private farms were allowed in the collective system. The new law in February 1935 stipulated that "the fruit plots used by collective farms, excluding the land occupied by houses, may occupy one-quarter to one-half of a hectare, and those in abnormal areas may occupy one hectare": "Each collective farm in the planting areas of grains, cotton, sugar beets, flax, hemp, potatoes, and vegetables may raise for its own use: one cow, two calves, one sow, and its young animals—if the management of the collective farm considers one sow insufficient, it may raise two sows and its young animals—no more than ten sheep and goats, an unlimited number of hens and rabbits, and no more than twenty beehives." In agricultural areas with livestock breeding, each collective farm may raise for its own use: two or three cows and two or three or more heads of livestock; in nomadic areas, the collective farm may raise for its own use: eight to ten cows, a total of one hundred to one hundred and fifty sheep and goats, an unlimited number of hens, no more than ten horses, and five to six camels. In this way, the existence of private farms in the collective system has been recognized as legal, and the private interests of the centralized farms are also encouraged. As a result, a considerable increase in the general agricultural products has been achieved.</p>
<p>Another feature of this period is that the Soviet government does not legally stipulate the maximum production volume. This method was adopted during the first Five-Year Plan. Although the completion of each department of the Five-Year Plan was different, the planned estimates increased year after year. As a result, due to the skills of workers and technicians, trying to force excessive production inevitably had a negative impact on production standards. This mistake was recognized by the Soviet authorities. Now attention is paid to improving the quality of products, and the requirement for quantity is reduced to moderate. If this statement is correct, then the quantity required in the 1935 plan should be less than that of 1934. In the 1935 plan, the 1935 plan has taken into account the strength of domestic industry, and not focused solely on increasing output. In this way, the completion of each department of this plan is more balanced. Now, there is progress in both the quality of industrial and agricultural products, and the authorities' attitude towards manual and technical personnel has also changed. The new regulations stipulate that there is a significant difference in the wage standards between skilled and unskilled workers.</p>
<p>These new trends are very obvious in the Soviet domestic economic policy and various state-owned enterprises—the reorganization of ordinary schools and universities, the revision of the constitution to democratize the election system, the estimation of remuneration for manual and mental work, and the combination of state-owned and private industries.</p>
<p>Under the current economic system, except for private farms inside and outside collective farms, all are run by state-owned or state-managed agencies, while under the New Economic Policy system, only economic enterprises related to the military are directly managed by the state.</p>
<p>This change in Soviet economic policy is a very important matter. The Soviet Union is trying to promote private enterprises on the one hand and implement state economic control on the other. It is impossible to predict now how far it will develop in the future, but the attempt itself is undoubtedly true and far-sighted.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Soviet Industry Under the Stakhanovite Movement</h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Stakhanovite movement, there have been several introductions in the country, but few have mentioned the actual effects this movement has already had in the Soviet Union. This movement can be said to be the most important feature of the Soviet Union's second Five-Year Plan, and it is also a further manifestation of the Soviet Union's socialist economic construction. This movement has not only ignited the enthusiasm of young men and women across the Soviet Union, but even advanced capitalist countries are astonished by the fact that production efficiency has been raised to the highest possible technical standards at the time.</p>
<p>What is the Stakhanovite movement? It is the improvement of industrial efficiency. Stakhanov was originally an ordinary coal miner in the "Central Irmino Coal Mine" of the Soviet Union's "Simply Speaking Donbas Mining Area," but suddenly became world-renowned, known as the "Hero of Labor" and a "Heroic Figure in History." Starting from November 14th last year, Moscow held a grand Stakhanovite Movement Congress. According to the report of Stakhanov himself, the originator of the Stakhanovite movement, the movement occurred because the work efficiency in the coal mine where he worked was extremely slow. He and his comrades had long wanted to find a way to improve it. Finally, on September 1st last year, he mined 102 tons of coal in six hours, and on September 9th, it increased to 175 tons, filling eleven freight cars, creating a world record. The average mining volume of each worker in this mining area was originally only six to seven tons, while Stakhanov alone exceeded the labor efficiency of "twenty-five people."</p>
<p>Now, the Soviet Union's rulers have promoted the Stakhanovite movement to all departments, and even popularized it in the fields of military affairs and culture. The Stakhanovite movement has become a lever for promoting the Soviet Union's entire socialist construction. Originally, the Soviet Union had long launched movements to improve production technology and increase labor productivity. In 1919, Lenin said, "In the final sense, the most important issue is the efficiency of labor production, which enables the new social institutions to win. Capitalism has created labor production efficiency never seen in the era of slavery. Similarly, because socialism creates newer and higher labor production efficiency, it can thoroughly overcome capitalism." During the first Five-Year Plan era, the Soviet Union put forward the slogans "Strive for new technology" and "Technology is enough to solve everything." In order to transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, a large-scale "shock brigade" movement was launched, attracting countless industrial workers to become shock brigade members, fully instilling them with technical knowledge. If the shock brigade movement is regarded as the representative feature of the first Five-Year Plan, then the Stakhanovite movement is the representative feature of the second Five-Year Plan. In terms of its effectiveness and influence, it is naturally a further step than the shock brigade movement. However, Stakhanov's success is based on past construction. As Stalin said, during the shock brigade movement, workers often lacked technical knowledge, so it was very difficult, but now, although there is still a gap between physical labor and mental labor, young workers with technical knowledge have become very popular.</p>
<p>The occurrence of all movements has actual needs, that is for sure. The reason why the Stakhanovite movement can succeed in the Soviet Union, leaving aside other conditions, is that the Soviet Union's current industry—especially heavy industry—has a great need for technical improvement. Conversely, even in industrialized countries such as Britain and the United States, at a time of overproduction, the original technology is still declining. Not only will new technologies not occur, but the need for them is also very small.</p>
<p>Originally, although the Soviet Union's industry has made rapid progress since the revolution, because it was originally a backward agricultural country, some industrial sectors still could not develop as planned. During the second Five-Year Plan, what the Soviet authorities found most difficult was that several major heavy industrial sectors were quite sluggish. If the problems could not be overcome, the Soviet Union's crisis would be extremely serious.</p>
<p>1935 was the third year of the Soviet Union's second Five-Year Plan. Although various heavy industries continued to progress over the years, the distance from the original plan was still very large. Taking ironmaking, coal mining, and oil as examples, the planned ironmaking target for the ironmaking industry in 1935 was:</p>
<p>Pig iron: 12.5 million kilograms</p>
<p>Steel: 12 million kilograms</p>
<p>Rolled steel: 8.5 million kilograms</p>
<p>But by the end of June last year, the production of pig iron was 6.04 million kilograms, only reaching 48% of the plan, and was even less than the 10 million kilograms achieved in 1934. The steel production volume was less than 6 million kilograms in the same period, which was even less than that of pig iron. The same is true for rolled steel, which did not achieve the intended purpose.</p>
<p>The planned coal mining target for 1935 was 102.2 million kilograms. In the first half of last year, the production volume was 49.78 million kilograms, equivalent to 45.5% of the plan for that year. The plan for May, July, August, and September and later was also not completed. The sluggishness of the coal mining industry in the Soviet Union's heavy industry is very obvious. In August last year, the Soviet government issued a warning: "The shortage of fuel in the Soviet Union has a great impact on the national economy. The sluggishness of the coal mining industry should be resolved immediately."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has spent a lot of effort on the organization and technology of the oil industry, so it has been making progress day by day in recent years. In 1934, the Soviet Union's oil industry had already ranked second in the world, only behind the United States, but according to the Soviet Union's planned plan and domestic situation, the distance is still far. In 1934, oil production reached 88.8% of the planned plan. In terms of its storage capacity, the quantity is actually too small (the Soviet Union's total oil resource storage accounts for 32% of the world's total, more than 30 billion kilograms). In 1935, it was planned to extract 33.33 million kilograms of oil (including oil and gas), but it was not actually achieved. Even the Soviet Union's famous "Grozny" oil field has reduced its production volume.</p>
<p>In such a situation, how to develop these heavy industries is naturally what the Soviet authorities are worried about. Upon seeing Stakhanov's success, they will inevitably use it as a grand movement to promote it in various industrial sectors.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>What impact has the Stakhanovite movement had on the Soviet Union's various industrial sectors? Generally speaking, as of today, several sectors have already increased their production volume by three to five times compared to before. In particular, in the coal mining industry, where the Stakhanovite movement originated, the results are even more remarkable. The Voroshilov Coalfield and the Sverdlovsk Coalfield have performed particularly well, and completely completed the previous year's plan by the end of November last year. That is, the Voroshilov Coalfield reached 104.7% of the estimated production volume at the end of November, and the Sverdlovsk Coalfield also reached 100.2%. In other industrial sectors, world records for production efficiency have also continued to occur. According to the calculations of the Soviet Union's famous technician Kurasov-Sese, since the start of the Stakhanovite movement, the labor production efficiency of heavy industry has generally increased by 16.3%. This number is very surprising.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly describe the technical improvements in the various heavy industrial sectors under the influence of the Stakhanovite movement.</p>
<p>(1) Ironmaking industry: As mentioned above, the Soviet Union's ironmaking industry was originally sluggish, but since the Stakhanovite movement occurred, by December last year, the Soviet Union's daily production volume had:</p>
<p>Steel: 40,000 kilograms</p>
<p>Pig iron: 38,500 kilograms</p>
<p>Regulations, steel exceeded pig iron. The technical improvement of the ironmaking sector is even more vigorously carried out. According to Soviet newspapers:</p>
<p>The utilization of "smelting furnaces," even compared with the best ironmaking plants in the United States, the utilization of smelting furnaces in the Haba plant (No. 3 furnace) accounted for 0.913%, the Alicheba plant (No. 4 furnace) accounted for 0.98%, and the Lushao plant (No. 1 furnace) accounted for 0.93%, while in the Soviet Union, it accounted for 87% in the M契爱夫 factory. Although it is not as good as the best factories in the United States, the speed of its improvement is already amazing.</p>
<p>Using Merkel fetal furnaces, the United States can probably produce 5.5 tons of steel per square meter, but in the Soviet Union, using the same furnace, the output is 5.02-5.24 tons, which is very common, and some can produce 6 tons. The best Stakhanovite-style factories can produce 8-12 tons.</p>
<p>(2) Coal mining industry: The coal mining industry was very sluggish in the first half of last year, but it recovered from the second half of the year. At the end of November last year, the Soviet Union's national production performance reached 93.5% of the planned target, and there were very few that did not reach it. And in the Stakhanovite birthplace, the Ruhr Coalfield, the results are even more amazing. Each coal mining machine can mine an average of 17 tons, while the highest in the United Kingdom is only 11 tons. The average output of coal per shift is 60 tons, breaking the highest record in the United States.</p>
<p>(3) Oil industry: Although the Soviet Union's oil industry has made significant progress, there are still many shortcomings. The completion of the planned plan is greatly hindered by this. Among the many shortcomings, the main one is the insufficient drilling equipment. Therefore, the important part of the oil plan last year was the drilling plan. The Soviet Union's drilling technology level is lower than that of the United States. This drilling plan will be the basic prerequisite for expanding production in the future. However, this is only in general terms. In the Stakhanovite-style oil extraction sector, its outstanding performance is another matter. Especially in Moinerf Chech, engineer Nitchi Qing's drilling speed broke the American record. In 1934, the average drilling speed of American oil fields was 412 meters per machine per month, while Nitchi Qing's engineer was as high as 1,243 meters. Just looking at such a high number, can't it match the highest record in the United States? As a result, the speed of the Soviet Union in recent years has increased as follows!</p>
<p>1932: 743 (kilometers)</p>
<p>1933: 838</p>
<p>1934: 1,240</p>
<p>1935 (planned): 1,600, but compared with the scale of 10 million to 15 million meters of wells in the United States in this year, the Soviet Union's planned 160</p>
<p>(4) Mechanical industry: In addition to the above three industries, in</p>
<p>(A) In the automobile industry, Sauichiev (person's name) of the High 基 automobile factory can produce 83 independent automobile factories in one hour, which is more than the production speed of the Soviet Union's highest 夫 倍.</p>
<p>(B) This is not the highest. Krake in the Fao Du factory can produce 118 parts per hour, while Dura Jin in the High Hanji factory can produce 140 per hour.</p>
<p>(C) Using a rotary cutting machine to manufacture cylinder covers, Germany manufactures 50 in one hour, but in the Soviet Union's 奥路奇尼契粹 factory, Guo Du夫 applied the German-made "U Aier Nei Er" machine and can manufacture 1,430 in one hour. This is how amazing the number is:</p>
<p>(D) The world's highest record for gas fusion welding is 93 meters, while in the Soviet Union's Chekhov factory, there are 126 meters in each shift.</p>
<p>Other similar situations are found in Soviet newspapers almost every day. Although the effectiveness of the Stakhanovite movement has reached what level, it cannot be said now, but the Soviet Union's heavy industry today has progressed a lot more than what was completed in the first Five-Year Plan, that is no doubt.</p>
<p>(5) Light industry: The role of the Stakhanovite movement in light industry is the same as in heavy industry. By 1935, it can be said that various backward factors in light industry were swept away. By the beginning of 1935, light industry reached 102.4% of the planned plan for this year. According to railway transportation, this is the most developed of the Soviet Union's economic sectors. Among them, especially food, such as comparing 1935 with the same period in 1934, various industries have the following increases:</p>
<p>Meat: 79.4 (thousand tons)</p>
<p>Sausage casings: 52.3 (tons)</p>
<p>Fish: 164 (tons)</p>
<p>Saler sugar: 349.6 (tons)</p>
<p>Cube sugar: 224.7 (tons)</p>
<p>Vegetable oil: 53 (tons)</p>
<p>Animal oil: 11.2 (tons)</p>
<p>Animal milk products: 37 (tons)</p>
<p>Confectionery: 48.4 (tons)</p>
<p>Canned food: 186.4 (million cans)</p>
<p>Starch products: 23.2 (thousand tons)</p>
<p>Beverages: 2,085 (thousand decaliters)</p>
<p>Cigarettes: 60 (100 million sticks)</p>
<p>Pipe tobacco: 822 (thousand bags)</p>
<p>Hemp oil: 6.9 (thousand tons)</p>
<p>(Only spirits decreased by 944,000 decaliters)</p>
<p>The development of light industry is an important sector of the second Five-Year Plan. In 1934, only 95.6% of the planned plan was completed. By 1935, due to abundant raw material production, the people's lives also became prosperous. The Soviet government therefore decided to increase production by 2-20%. Therefore, by the beginning of December last year, it completed 102.4% of the planned plan. In addition, the Soviet Union began to produce textiles in large quantities, and the increase in production volume followed more:</p>
<p>Cotton fabrics: 2,668 million meters</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics: 70 million meters</p>
<p>Linen fabrics: 230 million meters</p>
<p>Silk fabrics: 280 million meters</p>
<p>In addition, the production of cultural appliances such as clocks and phonographs has also increased significantly. Light industry is most closely related to people's lives. The development of light industry is also a sign of the improvement of the Soviet people's lives. The Stakhanovite movement has also had a great impact on the technical improvement of light industry. For example, at the first Stakhanovite Congress, according to Ms. Uinokule Duturhuo's report, she only managed 16 to 26 looms a year ago, but now she can manage 144 looms.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Now, let's take another look at the general industrial progress of Soviet Russia and its position in the world. As the foundation of all industries, and under the premise of having to develop the military industry under the encirclement of various imperialist countries, the Soviet Union naturally attaches importance to heavy industry, especially the development of the steel industry. Within the Soviet Union's own planned plan, the development of the steel industry has not reached the expected level, but compared with the various capitalist countries, especially in the past few years of economic panic and sharp reduction in production, the Soviet Union's progress in this area has been very large. For example, in terms of the speed of pig iron production, it took the capitalist countries an average of 58 years to reach their current state, while the Soviet Union only took ten years:</p>
<p>The speed of pig iron production expansion (comparison between the Soviet Union and other capitalist countries)</p>
<p>Capitalist countries</p>
<p>Looking at the actual production numbers, the development of Soviet steel production is very fast. For example, from 1929 to the first half of 1935, the proportion occupied has increased from 4.6% to 21.7%, and steel has increased from 4.3% to 14.6%. This expansion has had a great impact on the development of the Soviet Union's entire industry.</p>
<p>1935 was the third year of the second Five-Year Plan. Taking the entire industry as a whole, in the first half of 1935, about 48.9% of the planned plan was completed, which was an increase compared to 46.1% in the same period of the previous year. Among them, heavy industry, which is the cornerstone of the Soviet economy, has the best performance. In 1935, many sectors surpassed 1934 by a lot. The performance was relatively poor for the fuel industry. The situation of each sector is as follows:</p>
<p>The percentage of completion of each sector of heavy industry according to the planned plan,</p>
<p>Even the Soviet government itself admits that among various industries, heavy industry has developed the fastest, as shown in the table below!</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, it can be seen that the speed of increase in each sector below 2 is not as fast as 1. The development of nationally important industries, the production industry of means of production, and heavy industry is very large. But this is only in terms of ratio. Since the start of the second Five-Year Plan, the absolute number of consumer goods production has also increased sharply. The voices of insufficient living products have long disappeared, so in terms of a single aspect, the increase in consumer goods production is also equally fast.</p>
<p>This is only for the first half of 1935. The development of the Stakhanovite movement was at its peak in the second half of the year. Due to insufficient materials, although specific figures cannot be given here, it is certain that it will surpass the first half of the year, that is no doubt.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: A View on the Past and Present of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn market has been advancing towards a peak. Upon investigation, the driving force behind its rise is completely the increase in the spot market price. The highest price for standard yarn on December 4th of last year was 202 yuan for the current month and 213 yuan and 40 cents for the forward month. Recently, standard yarn for the near month reached 207 yuan and 40 cents, an increase of 5 yuan and 20 cents, and the forward month reached 212 yuan and 30 cents, still 1 yuan and 10 cents lower. 20-count spot yarn Red Man Bell was priced at 200 yuan and 3 yuan last year, but has now reached 215 yuan and a half, an increase of 12 yuan and a half. The 16-count Red Man Bell price was 193 yuan, but is now selling for 209. An increase of 16 yuan and a half. 20-count Japanese yarn Blue Phoenix was 200 yuan last year, but recently it is 213 yuan, an increase of 13 yuan as well. In comparison, the spot price has risen sharply, and the forward standard yarn has not yet recovered the peak line of last year. The near-month standard cotton last year's high price was 42 yuan and 8 and a half cents, but recently it has reached 44 yuan and 4 and a half cents, an increase of 1 yuan and 7 cents. The forward month reached 46 yuan and 3 cents last year. The highest price once reached 46 yuan and 5 cents, which is still 2 cents and a half short. The spot cotton fire engine flower on December 4th sold for 45 yuan and a half, and the recent selling price is 50 yuan and 5 cents, an increase of 5 yuan. Tongzhou flower sold for 46 yuan and a half last year, and is now selling for 52 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan and a half. Observing the above situation, it is clear that the trend is actually towards a high level. However, in general, the industry tends to sell off because the price has reached a high point. As for the financial community and the gold industry gang, because the cotton yarn itself is solid, the standard yarn must look at 220 yuan, which is a deliberate situation. The forward yarn is between 212 yuan. The activity of the short side is particularly strong. The forward cotton is greatly impacted after each factory orders printed cotton, and the situation is more sluggish. In short, last year's annual harvest was poor, and the output decreased by 3 million dan, so the long side's thoughts are more intense. The following table lists the highest prices of last year's December 4th current and forward cotton yarn and the recent situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton rose and fell by three pounds. Near-month firms limited purchases and covered shorts, so the May and July contracts may approach spot prices. Cotton merchants moved May shorts to the far month. The outline of the farmland case is vague and insufficient to affect the market, causing foreign companies to sell short in the far month. Afterwards, some short accounts covered, and market prices rose again. Until the Smith case has a definite development, trading is very limited. The closing was firm, with spot prices up three pounds, futures up one to ten pounds. British spot cotton fell two points, futures rose one point. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters, and transactions were scarce. The Pingguo fell 0.75 to 1.5 rupees, Olmra fell 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (21st telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi flower on the 23rd was 196 rupees and a half, an increase of 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>A total of 40,033 bags. In addition, there are still 4,770 bags of miscellaneous sugar in the Xitaigu warehouse.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Sales Are Stagnant and Market Prices Continue to Fall - Northern Sales Are Moving, but It Is Still Difficult to Rise -</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs still arrived at 50. (A total of more than 10,000 stone of goods) Sales in this street are still stagnant, but Baowei has continued to handle more than 4,000 packages of thin rice and more than 1,000 packages of thick japonica rice from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs. However, the market is ultimately abundant and surging, and the trend is still soft. Therefore, the price of thick early japonica rice continues to be reduced by more than a corner, and the higher price of thin rice is several points lower, and the middle decision is beyond the scale. Duyangjian is also tired, and the Yinbian Yuan fell by another corner.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads under the river were Nian Siwu, and various transactions on the market were very sluggish. The top white japonica rice price was slightly outside the corner, and the middle decision was cut by two or three corners, the early rice followed by a short two corners, the thin rice short by one corner and four or five points, the Yinbian Yuan small one corner and six or seven points, the Yang Du Xian price fell by about a small two corners, and the remaining various rice were also slightly cornered.</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>Appetite Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>The stomach is easy to be delicate and weak, but it is difficult to be strong and healthy. People with healthy stomachs must eat a lot, have good digestion, and be full of energy. However, if you encounter hard work and use your brain too much, your appetite will inevitably decrease, leading to chronic stomach disease and loss of health. Mr. He Jinfan, who lives on Du Mei Road, lost his appetite due to hard work, disliked eating, belched and had acid reflux, and felt bloated and painful after eating. He was treated repeatedly without success. Constipation, weight loss, and lack of energy made him weaker day by day. Later, he sought treatment from Yu Chu. He was instructed to take "Strong Stomach Essence" to transform his stomach shuttle energy in order to boost his appetite. As a result, he achieved good results, his food intake increased greatly, his energy was radiant, and his bowel movements were smooth. A letter was received from him the other day, saying that after taking two medicines for more than a month, his three-year old breath was suddenly cleared, his vitality was re-emerged, and his body recovered to health. Every time he attended a banquet, he devoured food and drink, and the four seats were shocked! Before and after are like two people.</p>
<h3>Rare and Wonderful News of Neurasthenia Treatment</h3>
<p>— Manuscript from Chen Xunci in Nanchang</p>
<p>Newly Pregnant After Long Marriage</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Sun Bohua, had been married for ten years and had not yet conceived. Later, I learned that Mr. Sun had committed masturbation by mistake during his development period, resulting in neurasthenia. First, he had seminal emission and spermatorrhea. After marriage, the disease became more urgent, and there was a trend that his penis could not be erected. The semen was cold and thin, which caused the relationship between husband and wife to be icy. Later, a friend from Shanghai sent him two bottles of "Buti Kang" from Melenborg in Germany. After Mr. Sun finished taking them, half of the disease was gone. He then went to Nanchang Zhonghua Pharmacy to buy half a dozen more. After taking them, his muscles were full, and diseases such as seminal emission and spermatorrhea were completely cured, and his male reproductive capacity became strong. The relationship between husband and wife became harmonious, surpassing the honeymoon. The other day, I went to Mr. Sun's house for something, and saw that his spouse was healthy and strong, exceeding usual. Mr. Sun also reported his own condition and the process of taking "Buti Kang" like this. He also said that his wife is pregnant today, all thanks to the gift of "Buti Kang."</p>
<h3>Dr. Deng Yuanhe's Clinical Record of Lung Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>Cured of Hemoptysis, Cough, and Seminal Emission</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Jin Zuyao, 26 years old, student. History: Early marriage, excessive sexual activity leading to depletion, resulting in hemoptysis. Symptoms: Stabbing chest pain, frequent coughing with much phlegm, containing blood spots, shortness of breath, increased body temperature in the evening, flushed cheekbones, insomnia and seminal emission, listlessness. Various medications proved ineffective for four years, leading to emaciation. Later, introduced by a friend, Mr. Miao Yong, he came to me for treatment. Prescription: Diagnosis of a cavity in the left lung, dense tuberculous spots on the apex of the right lung. Prescribed medication according to the symptoms, instructed to purchase and take German "Pulmonal" to coagulate blood and nourish the lungs, while eliminating cough and phlegm. Simultaneously, prescribed German "Corpol" to treat seminal emission and insomnia. Within two weeks, hemoptysis disappeared, cough subsided, appetite increased, sleep was peaceful, sperm was strengthened, and spirits were sufficient. Fearing recurrence, he was strongly advised to continue for three weeks to ensure complete eradication. He recently wrote a letter stating that due to the effectiveness of the two medications, his body swiftly recovered and strengthened within a month, and his weight sharply increased, akin to a second rebirth.</p>
<p>Coughing, Wheezing, Phlegm, and Saliva Cured in Wife Simultaneously</p>
<p>Patient, Ms. Zhang Xuedan, 32 years old, businesswoman. History: Early damage from masturbation, coupled with excessive labor, leading to occasional single coughs. Symptoms: Phlegm and saliva with white foam, occasional chest pain, infrequent cough but rapid breathing, reduced appetite, insomnia and night sweats, seminal emission and impotence, extreme depletion, unbearable, medications proved largely ineffective. Sought consultation from me only last spring. Prescription: X-ray examination of the lungs revealed stage three disease, which could not be treated with ordinary medications. Urgently instructed her to take German "Pulmonal" to strengthen and nourish the lungs, thereby eliminating phlegm and saliva. Simultaneously instructed her to also take "Corpol," thereby curing insomnia and seminal emission. Following the prescription for over a month yielded positive results. Her wife also suffered from cough and irregular periods, so it was recommended she take "Pulmonal" according to the prescription, and combine it with German "Corpol" to regulate menstruation, leading to complete cure. Last week, her cousin came for consultation, mentioning that since the Zhangs had been thoroughly cured, they were physically strong and healthy, and despite hard work, their spirits remained high. Moreover, Ms. Zhang had happily conceived a son last month.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Gonorrhea Treatment in Moscow Hospitals</h3>
<p>Throughout history, various countries have devoted immense effort to researching gonorrhea medications, leaving no stone unturned, but ultimately failing to create an effective remedy. Thus, the saying "gonorrhea is fiercer than a tiger" has long been prevalent. However, in recent years, due to scientific advancements, the German gonorrhea panacea "Clinnon" was invented, thus defeating all other gonorrhea medications. Scholars abandoned their research efforts and unanimously supported this unparalleled remedy! In Western countries, whether doctors or male and female patients, everyone uses "Clinnon," resulting in an 83% reduction in gonorrhea patients. Taking the Soviet Union as an example: the country is known for its extremely strict regulations on importing foreign drugs, but "Clinnon" is promoted vigorously and completely exempt from import duties, because the medication's efficacy is so compelling. It is important to clearly recognize the word "Clinnon"! According to precise statistics from Moscow hospitals: over 98% of those who took three or four bottles of this medicine achieved swift and complete cure! Those who could not be cured were due to disobeying the doctor's instructions during treatment, indulging in alcohol and labor, and not taking care of their health. Therefore, the prognosis was not very good. In fact, if this medicine is taken with careful care, there is no one who cannot be completely eradicated. This can be proven by the fact that people who have been cured never recur even after engaging in sexual activity. Alas! From now on, the theory that gonorrhea is difficult to treat will be overturned!</p>
<h3>The Problem of Incomplete Sexual Development</h3>
<p>— Dr. Bao Zhiping</p>
<p>People often pay little attention to sexual development. Generally, during adolescence, due to a lack of sexual knowledge, many engage in the bad habit of masturbation, thus prematurely damaging the youth glands that are waiting to develop. As a result, males experience short stature, incomplete development of reproductive organs, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, insufficient reproductive strength for erection, while females experience delayed menstruation, frequent leukorrhea, obesity or thinness. Common symptoms in both sexes include erotic dreams, insomnia, dizziness, vertigo, sore waist and knees, mental confusion, inconsistency in work, and weak memory. All men and women with incomplete development are major causes of infertility.</p>
<p>In order to solve the difficult problem of incomplete sexual development in both sexes, German reproductive scientist Dr. Meren has spent decades of effort inventing "Corpol" for men and "Corpol" for women. The two medicines are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of vigorous male and female animals in their prime, such as lions, tigers, gorillas, and sea dogs, respectively (male animals for men, female animals for women). After taking this medicine, the structure of the reproductive system can be transformed within two to three weeks, allowing sexual development to reach normalcy, eliminating the aforementioned symptoms, and causing infertility to become pregnancy. For women with leucorrhea, using "Corpol" in conjunction with "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets" is said to be highly effective.</p>
<h3>German Gonorrhea Specific Medicine Clinnon Clinical Experience Photograph</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>(1) Emergency Treatment for Acute Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Shen Huazhong, 25 years old, resident of Old North Gate. One evening, he was teased by a friend and immediately felt gonorrhea. Soon, the urethra felt stabbing pain, secreting a tea-green discharge mixed with many red blood cells. The glans was swollen, the foreskin turned over, the urge to urinate was urgent, but urination was very difficult, causing a feeling of distension and dull pain in the lower abdomen and perineum. During the night, he experienced painful ejaculation. Fortunately, Mr. Shen was quite knowledgeable in medicine and knew this was acute gonorrhea, so he sought treatment from me. I told Mr. Shen that his illness required internal medication to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria in order to stop the progression of the disease. He was immediately instructed to take the famous German gonorrhea medicine "Clinnon" to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and facilitate urination, allowing the bacteria and toxins to be eliminated through urine. Two weeks later, the urethral pain stopped and the inflammation subsided. Continuing the medication for another week led to complete recovery. Mr. Shen is a lover of sports, and I heard that since recovering from this illness, he has continued to engage in tireless athletic training and has never relapsed.</p>
<p>(2) Leucorrhea in Husband and Wife</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. He Shoufu, suffered from seminal emission after contracting gonorrhea, resulting in a very weak body. After each period of fatigue, semen flowed out continuously and mixed with blood spots, and the urine was also abnormally turbid. This was a complication of gonorrheal seminal vesiculitis and spermatorrhea. "Clinnon" and "Corpol" were administered, and he recovered completely after five weeks of continuous use. Blood serum tests showed no traces of gonorrhea, guaranteeing complete eradication. However, Mr. He's wife also suffered from leukorrhea for many years, with redness and swelling of the vaginal tract and erosion of the vulva. I was asked to recommend a good medicine, so she was instructed to take "Clinnon" internally and use "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets" externally to eliminate vaginitis and swelling, and vulvar erosion. After four weeks, the lesions in the vaginal tract and vulva were completely cured, and the areas recovered as before. The gonorrhea was also eradicated. Mr. and Mrs. He had been struggling to conceive for a long time, and after the illness was cured, she became pregnant.</p>
<h3>Senile Asthma</h3>
<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Asthma often occurs in people over middle age. Coughing, phlegm, shortness of breath, and extreme suffering are most common, often leading to heart failure and death. Therefore, it is urgent to eradicate the condition. Based on my clinical experience, the medication with special efficacy in eliminating cough, reducing phlegm, and calming wheezing and asthma is undoubtedly the German "Pulmonal"! It has proven efficacy for all chronic bronchitis, infant pertussis, and colds. Moreover, this medication not only contains liver and lung hormones from fish oil to strengthen the weak, stimulate the stomach, and increase appetite, preventing stage one, two, and three pulmonary tuberculosis; it is also a lecithin preparation, which is suitable for smokers with cough and phlegm, and quitting smoking. It is powerful and pure, without any stimulation. If taken regularly, it can nourish the lungs and strengthen the body.</p>
<h3>Anti-Gonorrhea Serum Cured My Chronic Illness</h3>
<p>— Letter from Xinpu to Promote Compassion</p>
<p>I contracted gonorrhea in the past and didn't care at first. Later, I tried various medications, but they were ineffective, and the illness became more difficult to cure. The testicles on both sides were swollen and hard, causing extreme pain! Last autumn, I also experienced pain and distension in the lower abdomen, frequent urination, going more than 20 times a day, making it difficult to sit or lie down, and joint pain. The suffering was indescribable, and I became thin and weak after suffering for a month. Fortunately, Dr. Zhou Jiren pointed me to Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment. After being treated with the latest German-invented anti-gonorrhea serum, urination became smooth and unobstructed in a few days, the abdominal distension disappeared completely, and the testicular swelling also subsided in less than a fortnight, reducing the pain immediately. Electric therapy was used, and everything recovered completely in two weeks, with clear urine. Eight years of chronic illness disappeared suddenly! Vitality increased daily, health recovered, as if reborn. Now, after more than a year, I am still healthy. Remembering the unforgettable contributions of famous doctors and famous medicines, I am writing this letter of thanks! I hope it will serve as a reference for those with the same illness.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea Can Be Self-Treated</h3>
<p>— Jin Yueren</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is the most common disease among women. Masturbation and rough sexual intercourse can all break the vaginal mucosa and transmit bacteria, thus causing leukorrhea. Leukorrhea also easily attracts bacteria, leading to unexpected dangerous diseases, and is not only a major cause of infertility. However, most women are always ashamed to tell others about such hidden illnesses, and are even less willing to seek medical treatment. For this disease, if it is caused by the husband's gonorrhea, they are immediately instructed to take "Clinnon" internally and use "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets" to plug the vaginal tract. This is always cured in three to four weeks. For those who have suffered from leukorrhea for a long time due to physical weakness, taking "Car-Schaudinn" and "Corpol" at the same time can often cure the disease in a short period of time. After recovery, they can have children as usual. This treatment can be done at home. I heard that many women have recently adopted this self-treatment method and have been cured.</p>
<h3>Ask the Doctor Mailbox</h3>
<p>Our special experts will answer questions separately about lung diseases, stomach diseases, women's diseases, venereal diseases, and sexual diseases. If you do not want your letter to be published, please include sufficient return postage and send it to Kangjian Pharmaceutical Company, No. 869 Wuding Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Ji Wude asks: I am 27 years old, weak, and have suffered from spermatorrhea for more than ten years. Last month, I also contracted gonorrhea. At first, it leaked white, followed by blood. It has not been cured after repeated treatments, and the urethra often feels blocked. Please introduce the most effective medicine!</p>
<p>Answer…Spermatorrhea is a symptom of sexual neurasthenia, and it will worsen if left untreated; you can quickly take "Corpol." To thoroughly eradicate gonorrhea, it is best to ask Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment. Before treatment, you can buy and take "Clinnon."</p>
<p>Menstrual Abscess Discharge</p>
<p>Ms. Aifeng asks: I have always had menstrual problems. Since last year, my husband infected me with gonorrhea, causing my menstruation to stop, but white discharge flows down. Now I plan to take "Corpol" internally. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Answer…In addition to taking "Corpol," you must also use "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets" externally. It is also better to take "Clinnon," which can take care of all aspects and make it easier to cure.</p>
<p>Reduced Appetite with Lung Disease</p>
<p>Zhang Shukeng asks: I have had lung disease for three years, and it has recently worsened. I cough up sputum with a lot of blood streaks, night sweats and hot flashes, and I am thin and do not eat. Please tell me what good medicine can cure this disease.</p>
<p>Answer…This lung disease is probably in the third stage, which is very dangerous. You can take "Pulmonal" to treat lung disease and "Strong Stomach Essence" to boost digestive function. Then the disease can be cured.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinical Report on Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Reasons for Difficulty in Curing Chronic Leucorrhea and Methods for Thorough Treatment</p>
<p>Everyone knows that chronic leucorrhea is difficult to cure. Based on my years of clinical experience, if someone who has suffered from gonorrhea has sexual intercourse with a woman even once, there is a possibility of infecting the other person; the female vaginal tract is a suitable place for gonococci to survive. Therefore, even if an unclean man has only one sexual encounter with a woman, and the man's gonorrhea has been proven to be eradicated by a doctor, if he later has sexual intercourse with the woman, the gonococci from the woman will still infect the already cured man. If this mutual infection continues, how can gonorrhea ever be eradicated?</p>
<p>When I encounter gonorrhea patients with wives, whether it is new or old gonorrhea, I use two treatment methods: first, I treat the man's old gonorrhea with anti-gonorrhea serum and electric therapy, and at the same time administer the internal medicine "Clinnon." On the other hand, I instruct the patient's wife to take "Clinnon" internally and use German "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets" to insert into the vaginal tract. If there are gonococci in the vaginal tract, they will all die when they encounter this medicine. Since I have used this treatment method, the results have been exceptionally good. Even if it is chronic leucorrhea for many years, it will never recur after it is cured. For those with wives who have gonorrhea, regardless of whether they have infected their wives, it is always best for their wives to use "Car-Schaudinn Vaginal Tablets," so that those with gonorrhea can treat gonorrhea, and those without gonorrhea can also ensure that they are not infected by gonorrhea. This is indeed a one-shot, two-bird approach.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Shanghai Jews Commemorate National Fighters</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>There are more than 500 Jews in Shanghai. On the morning of the 16th of this month at 10 o'clock, all the Jews in Shanghai held a grand commemorative parade at the Jewish General Assembly at No. 35 Moore Road to commemorate the 16th anniversary of the death of their national hero Troplerder and to promote the movement to return to Palestine.</p>
<p>We all know that the Jewish nation has lost their country for more than 2,500 years. Until now, they have no fixed territory (it is said that the Soviet Union already has a Jewish country). Their footprints are all over the world. Although a small number of them have manipulated some of the financial ruling power in the United Kingdom and the United States because they are good at doing business, the pain of losing their country is enough for you to suffer with just a contemptuous smile from others.</p>
<p>Yes, the Jews have lost their country for more than 2,500 years, but until now, they still have the idea of ​​returning to their country, which may be considered a "luxury." In the gathering on the 16th, the more than 500 Jews in Shanghai (remember, only more than 500!) had already armed their young people in preparation for the restoration of their country: divided into young children, teenagers, adults (divided into army and navy), women, and other teams. This heroic action is caused by the pain of losing their country. To us Chinese people who are about to become "quasi-slaves to the country" (?), it is really heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Arabs and Jews now live together in the ancient Jewish kingdom. In 1919, Troplerder returned to Palestine to carry out the national construction movement and was unfortunately killed by Arabs. Before being killed, Mr. Te and his 50 or so comrades had waged a fierce resistance. Before his death, Mr. Te said the following heroic words: "I am a Jewish nationalist, regardless of anything else, no class, no selfish desires, no self. I am a piece of iron and I am willing to be used for the country. If the country needs a wheel, I am a wheel. If the country needs a nail, a plow, or a sickle, I am it! Jewish nationalists are the crystallization of the country's wishes, and they sacrifice everything for the country!" These words are now deeply engraved in the hearts of the armed Jewish youths. The Jewish nation will never perish! "Even if Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin." Now, isn't there much more than "three households" in the Jewish nation?</p>
<p>People who lost their country more than 2,500 years ago are still making every effort to prepare for the restoration of their country. We have not yet reached the point of losing our country.</p>
<h3>The Green Island</h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>——Travel Notes</p>
<p>On the fourth day of our voyage, we arrived at the port of a tall mountain peak</p>
<p>"That's the green island"! Look, what a beautiful island! Have you read "Investiture of the Gods"? Doesn't the old myth</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Are there many interesting fairylands described? Well, let's just assume that it is one of the three Penglai islands!"</p>
<p>The old uncle squinted his eyes and looked into the distance, patting my arm.</p>
<p>"The mountain peaks of the island country are green, and it is also green from a distance. Who would believe that those are the three Penglai islands in mythology? Look, lush grass is growing, decorating the huge and neat Western-style buildings, arranged level by level all the way up to the top, which is hidden in the clouds and mist, and the top of the mountain has become many charming illusions.</p>
<p>The sun is far away in the East China Sea, and all that is seen is a deeply affectionate rosy glow covering the magnificent island country, smiling like a virgin!</p>
<p>Look, the southwest side is Kowloon. Kowloon and the green island are like two sisters, beautiful and charming! Think about it, whoever has money to live here will enjoy happiness."</p>
<p>The old uncle pointed so much, nagging, but I didn't understand what it meant:</p>
<p>"Why? This is no longer our country. Maybe we have become slaves."</p>
<p>"Little Lai'er! Why do you still say those childish things?"</p>
<p>His face looked gloomy, like a defeated fairy in mythology, and his cramped face gradually trembled. He took a breath and looked at the deep green sea. —Many magnificent and large fireboats and long warships were anchored on the sea, as if glaring at the coast in protest. Some small steamships were floating and walking, spewing out white foam.</p>
<p>What he said was a little sentimental.</p>
<p>"This world is the same everywhere. The rich are with the rich, and they don't care about their faces or their motherland! Here, things are combined to form a special product of the current century. Of course, people without money may be stripped, and people without money are slaves here."</p>
<p>I understood, his words were like a bowl of cold water poured on my body, and my heart was also beating. That beautiful green island actually hides so many festering sores!</p>
<p>The small fireboat carried us into the port. Slowly, the old and the young stood side by side, leaning on the railing and kissing the fleeting sea breeze.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, I'll take you to see the factory from a few years ago! That's where I worked. Little Lai'er, do you know? During the Hong Kong and Guangzhou general strike a few years ago, this place turned into a dead port. There was really no life, and the faces of all the rich people were anxious. I was also one of that group, and I would also lead my companions across the mountains, swim across the sea, and return to the provincial capital."</p>
<p>The old uncle was still telling his stories, an endless string of them, but the ship had arrived at the shore. The distant and long jetty and the tall Western-style houses seemed to have woken up, opened their mouths wide, and revealed chaotic sounds, waiting for the constantly incoming tourists to throw themselves into its embrace. The old uncle twisted my hand again:</p>
<p>"Let's go play, but there aren't any beautiful things like in the myth!"</p>
<p>That's right, I looked around strangely. Under the narrow arcade, there was still hiding in the shadows, and the two-story trams were walking wearily. Every shop was fluttering with: "Big Discount"! "Selling at Cost"!... The flags seemed to have flown in from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, we had run to the back of the mountain, looking at the green sea from the green meadow, and the virgin-like sun was shining on everything in the island country again.</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mingxia</p>
<p>I can't remember how old I am now, but anyway, when I was very young, I suddenly felt lonely. The first time I felt lonely was in my mother's eyes.</p>
<p>It was a spring afternoon. The rural towns that specialize in estimating the business of farmers were so quiet during this busy farming season that there was not even a sound of people. Our house was farther away from the shop because there were more houses, so it was even quieter in the afternoon, so quiet that even the sound of a bird flapping its wings could be heard. The small patio was full of sunshine, but because there was not even a shadow, I didn't feel it. A clump of small grass was growing happily among the rubble.</p>
<p>My mother was sitting on a bamboo chair sewing clothes, and I was sitting on a small stool reading. I don't know if it was because the quiet air was forcing me not to open my mouth; or if I didn't want to break the calm air, neither of us said a word? After a long time, my mother suddenly hummed a song that I hadn't heard. The singing was so soft that it sounded like a low sigh. Just as the singing was getting lower and lower, suddenly the sound of "Ding Dang" "Ding Dang" came from a distance. This was the sound of the iron shop at the end of the town.</p>
<p>Originally, it was a whole piece of silence. At this time, the sound of hammering iron broke it and made the silence even thicker. At the same time, the smoke from the neighboring house cooking some snacks curled up gently. At this time, my mother suddenly put down the sewing in her hand and stared intently at the clump of small grass in the middle of the rubble. It was at this time that I suddenly saw something I had never seen before in my mother's eyes — "loneliness."</p>
<p>Like a heavy piece of lead pressing on my heart, I could no longer push it away.</p>
<p>Yes, at some times, I had forgotten about this "loneliness." But this time was not very long, and as time passed year after year, this piece of lead also became heavier and heavier year after year. Recently, this piece of lead has become so heavy that I can hardly carry it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, loneliness starts in the afternoon, especially at night. As soon as the wrong yellow electric light comes on, this loneliness is always particularly aggravated. Huang Zhongze's poem "A hundred sorrows fall like shadows before the lamp" I think half of the so-called hundred sorrows here is loneliness.</p>
<p>If someone is knowledgeable, then he will probably always feel lonely. There are too many articles describing loneliness throughout history, but only one section by Mr. Lu Xun truly writes about loneliness:</p>
<p>"In a large Western-style building, there was no one else except me. I calmed down. The silence was as thick as wine, making me slightly drunk. Looking out the back window, there were many white spots in the bone-like chaos, which were clumps of graves; a deep yellow fire was the evening bell of Nanputuo Temple. In front of me, the sea and the sky were vast, and the dark catkins-like colors were about to pounce on my heart. I leaned on the stone railing and looked into the distance, listening to the sound of my own heart. All around seemed to be boundless sorrow, suffering, desolation, and death, but they were mixed with this loneliness, turning it into medicinal wine, adding color, adding flavor, adding fragrance..."</p>
<p>Because Mr. Lu Xun was not a weak person, he was able to chew on such thick loneliness. I don't know how many people in the world have committed suicide because of this simple loneliness?</p>
<p>Loneliness is not sadness, but it makes people feel more uncomfortable than sadness. What's more, when a person feels unbearable sadness, he has often come out from under the heavy pressure of loneliness.</p>
<h3>The Night Watch</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>When the fire crackles in the stove, and the quilt gradually warms, it makes one have a greedy longing for solitude in an empty room.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the night wind blows hard, carrying the cold, arranging a piercing tune on the four or five wires at the top of the lamppost, playing it intensely. The night has some terror and some cold.</p>
<p>But what is even more terrifying and cold is the weary striking of the night watchman's clapper, floating sparsely in a troubled dream.</p>
<p>A clapper and a lantern together probe the bottomless third and fifth watches of the night.</p>
<p>The night traveler of the night watch, like a ghost, takes steps, steps as strange and quiet as the night. Terror and cold are also in his heart.</p>
<p>For an empty room, there is a greedy longing for solitude. For the desolate night watch, I hold a feeling of eager anticipation for a meeting.</p>
<p>In a troubled night, I caress the scars of a weary life, I futilely use rest to apply to the scars, futilely use quiet natural numbers to massage the pain; thus there is a heavy sigh, in a night troubled by sleeplessness.</p>
<p>Without an upsurge of sleepiness, but instead a feeling of closeness to the sparse sounds of the night watch, anticipating it with such eager feelings.</p>
<p>The night is without chaotic noises, as quiet as the endless sea. The sound of the clapper cast into the sea of night is like a stone cast into a dark puddle, densely spreading out sound waves as terrifying as the night.</p>
<p>The sound waves of the clapper, surging from a distant corner of a house, surge into my room, so my eardrums recount it to me again, and in my ear canals there are lingering, drowning notes, low, echoing notes.</p>
<p>The sound of the clapper gradually approaches, and then gradually fades away. I remember that the narrow street is curved, passing by this curved street, the narrow wooden bridge and the mud road lead straight past my house, and lie outside the window of the house.</p>
<p>Approaching the night watchman, the changing sound, and a weak paper lantern together, stir my eager heart, for no reason I swallow a sigh, a selfish sigh of some terror and some cold.</p>
<p>Facing the direction from which the strange night traveler comes, we brazenly prop up half our bodies, filtering through my sleepy eyes, watching leisurely and in astonishment, the ghost-like night traveler wearing a worn felt hat, the lazy, red lantern, and the monotonous sound of the clapper, desolately probing the bottomless night watch.</p>
<p>Like hearing the cry of a night food seller, I feel an infinite, profound taste, echoing low in the vacuum of emotions.</p>
<p>It is not that the sound of the night watch disturbs sleep, but rather that the sound of the night watch has a familiar feeling for me, a hypnotic effect.</p>
<p>Please - those sparse but familiar sounds of the night watch.</p>
<p>The sound of the night watch has gone away, leaving residual faint tones on the four or five wires at the top of the lamppost.</p>

<p>The western palace is quiet at night, and a hundred flowers are fragrant. Wanting to cast aside the beaded curtain, the sorrow of spring is long. The noble consort sits alone on the sandalwood couch, burning red candles high, awaiting the king. Gao Lishi. Reports to the Lady. Tonight the emperor is lodging in Zhaoyang. Taizhen hears this and adds to her sorrow. Lazily, she goes to remove her palace makeup. Falling asleep in her clothes on the mandarin duck quilt. She sees a bright moon shining into the palace courtyard. Alone, cold, she sleeps!</p>
<h3>Nora (13)</h3>
<p>— Drawing by Wan Chaozhen, Explanation by Xin Xin</p>
<p>Nora walks back and forth, restless, and seeing that box of strange costumes for the dance party, she feels particularly disturbed. She tentatively asks Mama Anna: If she leaves the children, will the children forget her? She wants to go out again...</p>
<p>When she is feeling troubled, Mrs. Lindon comes. Mrs. Lindon agrees to help her fix that "Italian Fisherwoman" dance dress. In their conversation, they talk about Dr. Nan Gai. Mrs. Lindon thinks that Nan Gai and she have some kind of improper relationship, and reproaches her for being so careless in her actions.</p>
<p>Nora explains that it was not Nan Gai who lent her the money. Nan Gai is a poor person suffering from spinal tuberculosis. He seems very familiar with Mrs. Lindon's name, but the reason why Helmer seemed not to recognize it at all when they met is because Helmer becomes very jealous whenever she mentions old friends, while Nan Gai likes to hear her talk about the past.</p>
<p>Talking about money, Mrs. Lindon sees Nora's restless expression, so she asks her what exactly she is hiding from her.</p>
<p>Just as Nora is about to tell her, Helmer returns.</p>

<h3>Yangtze Holds Hundred Flowers Dance Festival</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Yangtze Ballroom has been praised by all sectors of society, so last year it increased seating once, but even now late guests still lack seats and the reception is inadequate, which is deeply regretted. The owner of the Yangtze, in view of this, immediately expanded the room, increasing a large number of seats, and renovated it to accommodate a large number of dancers. The project is about to be completed, and a Hundred Flowers Dance Festival is specially prepared to open on March 21st, lasting for seven days until the evening of the 27th, to provide entertainment for all sectors, and to record the new ballroom, and to thank customers for their patronage over the years. The initiation of this event is to examine the individual nature of each dancer in the hall, their movement and stillness, quality and inferiority, height and weight, and then determine which flower they should be made up as, so that people and this flower have sympathy and the same nature. The strong interest in this, appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar, is precisely the idea of beauties like flowers for you to choose from. While dancing, the branches are radiant, the fragrance of the flowers is overflowing, leaning on the red and relying on the green, utterly infatuating, still hoping that ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, poets and writers, will evaluate them one by one, in order to conform to the theme of beauties like flowers, and increase interest.</p>
<h3>Slapstick King Luo Ke's New Work "The Cowardly Hero" to Be Released</h3>
<p>— (Qiu)</p>
<p>The works of Slapstick King Luo Ke in the past were all produced by his own company, and then entrusted to Paramount or other companies for distribution. But in these few years, he has always wanted to join another film company to make a film, hoping to achieve better results than his previous works. This is the reason why he made "The Milky Way," a film for Paramount. This story is based on a successful Broadway stage play, plus Luo Ke's excellent acting skills, its success is of course beyond doubt. The film includes laughter and romance, very rich, indeed a supreme masterpiece for movie fans to pass the time in spring. Co-starring with Luo Ke are also the mustachioed Adolph Menjou and the beautiful , etc. It is heard that the Grand Theater has decided to show this film immediately after "Barehanded Persuading the King" is finished, and it is expected that it will cause a sensation again.</p>
