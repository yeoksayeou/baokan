<h3 id="c10">日本蘇聯之空中宣傳戰爭 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>日本同蘇聯在遠東的備戰。不但在海陸空軍方面。已經到了短兵相接的地步。便是在宣傳方面。也到了互相衝突的階段。最近日本在長崎造一百五十基羅瓦特的廣播大電台。預備用强大的播音力。壓倒蘇聯伯力的廣播電台。便是明證。因為日本與蘇聯國體不同。統治階級的主張與理想。互相衝突。到了兩國間有戰爭的時候。宣傳上的决鬥。比之於軍事上經濟上的决鬥更要劇烈。而無綫電廣播。乃是宣傳最有效最便利的方式。</p>
<p>摟日本同盟社的消息。伯力電台違反了國際無綫電公約。偸用日本東京電台的波長度數。因為伯力的電台力量。比東京的大些。所以東京所放送的節目。被他攪擾得不能外達。當然這是日本一面之辭。也是日本造長崎大電台的藉口。然而遠東的空中宣傳戰爭已經開始。蘇聯與日本的宣傳侵略。已經相互的侵入國境以內。而宜傳戰爭會引起惡劣的感情。因此激動軍事上之行動。却是十分明顯的現象與可能的結果。</p>
<p>在前次世界大戰期中。德國因為宣傳的組織不嚴密。工具技術不及英法。在精神上心理上大受打擊。因而在軍事上受到失敗。魯登道夫將軍說德國之失敗。完全因為英法宣傳之勝利。近年以來。各國競以無綫電廣播為對外作宣傳侵略之工具。奧國的革命。便是德國國社黨在慕尼黑的無綫電廣播所引起的。莫斯科的大電台。按時用英法西等國語言。放送煽動各國無產階級革命的演說。因為「以太」是散滿空中。不受國界之限制的。所以宣傳之戰爭。隨時可以開釁。隨時可以施行報復。蘇聯與德國之間。蘇聯與波蘭。德國與波蘭之間。都有這種戰鬥。而最近西班牙內亂。政府與叛軍之無綫電廣播。更蹬明這個宣傳工具在戰爭上佔着重要地位。</p>
<p>遠東的空中宣傳戰。已經開始了。遠東的空中秩序。已經因日蘇之互相放送同波長之播音而擾亂了。伯力的電台是一百基羅瓦特。未來的長崎電台是一百五十基羅瓦特。而南京的電台只有七十五基羅瓦特。長崎可以壓倒伯力。伯力也可以壓倒南京。如果我們不從速建立大的電台。一旦遠東有戰爭。我們收音機中不是共產主義的宣傳。便是日本侵略的播音。領空權操在他人之手。是多危險多可怕的事。</p>

<h3 id="c113">財政部　改進我國銀行業　建立中央準備銀行完成使命　充實商業銀行活潑市面金融 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>新新社云、我國金融、經政府實施幣制政策、澈底改革以來、已趨穩定、財政當局、現正力謀改進金融樞紐之銀行業、使之統系化、俾充分發揮銀行機能、茲將各情分誌如决、</p>
<p>中央準　備銀行</p>
<p>中央銀行、為銀行之銀行、亦卽全國金融之中樞也、我國自中央銀行成立以來、對於資助銀行、調整金融、已具相當成績、如最近二年內、中央銀行會同中國交通兩銀行、拆放鉅欵、直接救濟同業、間接調劑市面、收效頗著、近復經理事會之决議、增加股本、進行改組為中央準備銀行、以便推廣票據貼現、與公開市塲之政策、發展中央銀行之機能、而完成銀行之銀行使命、該項改組計劃、已正在積極進行、將來實現後、則銀行信用、得以充分運用、農工商業、可望迅速發展、對全國經濟之復興與進步、實有莫大之補益、</p>
<p>發展特種銀行</p>
<p>我國特種銀行、經財政當局規定者、計有三種、（一）中國銀行為發展國際匯兌之銀行、（二）交通銀行為發展國內實業之銀行、（三）中國農民銀行、為發展全國農業之銀行、此三種銀行、各有特殊業務、以期完成國民經濟建設、如中國銀行在倫敦大阪兩處、本有分行，近復在紐約及新加坡添設分行、俾促進中外匯兌業務之發展、至於交通銀行努力投資實業、中國農民銀行普遍實行農村放欵、均依照原定計劃、按步進行、兼之中國交通增加官股、中國農民易名改組、並特准發行紙幣、與中中交三行法幣同等行使、三行實力、更見雄厚、相互扶助、發展我國農工各業、關係實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>充實商業銀行</p>
<p>商業銀行、為國內最普遍·最重要之銀行、關於商業之盛衰、關係至為密切、惟我國商業銀行中、規模偉大·資本雄厚者、為數尚少、而城市都會中、則小規模銀行之開設較多、該項現象、其弊害為各行本身實力分散、業務不易發展、且同業轉多競爭、故財部有鑒於此、對於商業銀行、務使增加資本、充厚實力、集中資金、使銀行組織健全化、恊助商業發展、活潑市面金融、如最近江浙中匯兩銀行之合併、四明銀行之籌議增加股本、綢業銀行之調整業務、均已逐步實施、充實內部組織、</p>
<p>推廣儲蓄銀行</p>
<p>我國儲蓄銀行之業務、因限於投資、機會狹小、未能充分發展、故國內純粹之儲蓄銀行而不多經營其他業務者、可謂絕無僅有、茲為推廣儲蓄銀行計、除由中國銀行添設儲蓄部外、復由中央銀行撥欵設立中央儲蓄會、鼓勵民衆儲蓄習慣、集中社會散資、同時力謀發展交通運輸、公用事業、開闢長期投資之新途徑、故此舉非僅運用餘資、發展企業、並可為社會造成節儉風氣、</p>
<p>實施銀行法規</p>
<p>我國銀行法規、業經明文公布、凡屬銀行、自應切實奉行、茲者、我國銀行制度、粗具規模、一切銀行法規、如中央銀行法。銀行法。儲蓄銀行法。信託法·以及特種銀行條例、聞均已决第詳加修正、不久當可實施、以保存戶權利、將來如商業銀行請求註册登記時、其開業資本總額·與發起入·經理人·之資格、均須嚴格審查、方可核准、而如銀行開業後、其業務範圍、經營方法、與營業狀况、均須隨時聽憑官員檢查、按時據實報告財部、以保障公衆利益云、</p>

<p>大公社云、楊樹浦海州路二十三號恒豐·友豐·大新·等三絲織廠全體工人、為要求恢復原有工資發生罷工後、黨政機關、恐糾紛延長、影饗廠方營業及工人生計、故特於前晨召集勞資雙方施行調處、當卽簽訂普加工資六厘、及被解雇工人、准予復工等四次和解筆錄、各該廠全體工人、均於昨晨六時三十分、一律進廠工作、秩序至為良好、所有該管捕房派駐中西探捕、於工人復工後、卽行撤退、</p>
<h3 id="c115">美亞二廠勞包雙方　談判解决　廠方接受取消等級　工方放棄其餘條伴 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>大公社云、閘北交通路美亞第二織綢廠、（現改為和濟）為工方要求普加每公尺工價一分、及取銷等級制、發生罷工風潮後、黨政機關及總工會、均派員進行調處、均無結果、前晚勞包雙方、直接再度談判之下、廠方（包工頭）已接受取消等級制、將乙丙兩字列入甲字計算、工方對普加工價及恢復九折工資、新工進廠待遇等條件、亦表示自動放棄、故糾紛遂告解决、前晚夜班男女工人、均一律進廠復工、</p>

<p>超募新工</p>
<p>該廠全體男女工人、為反對華經理魏子潛苛刻工人、並開除女工、激成怠工以來、已將兩星期、廠方自工人怠工風潮發生後、各部間工作完全停止、且値茲秋凉天氣、正出品加緊之時、受此影響、損失非小、為維持業務計、决定招募新工進廠工作、但工方得此消息後、已組隊嚴密偵詢、並監視新工入廠工作、</p>
<p>今晨請願</p>
<p>廠方通告怠工工人、於昨日結算應得工資、但全體工人、恐被廠方乘機監視行動、均未到廠領取、昨日為星期例假、全體工人、定於今晨上午十時、分赴市黨部、社會局、總工會、等各機關請願、一面將議决之八項條伴、向英大班匯司勃路克、提出直接談判、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>本年第二季上海工商業之異動概况，一般皆較本年第一季及去年同期為佳，據本所調查統計所得，可列表如下</p>
<p>上海工商業各項異動比較表</p>
<p>新創　擴充　收縮　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>二十四年第二季　二〇　一一　四六二　一一六</p>
<p>二十五年第一季　九一　四四　三二　九一六　二二二</p>
<p>二十五年第二季　一一一　　五一　二九　七一四　一八一</p>
<p>新創與擴充，第二季較第一季增多，收縮，改組與閉歇，第二報較第一季减少，適足證明社會經濟之漸趨好轉。至本年第二季之三個月中，六月份因季節關係，新創較前兩月稍减，閉歇則較增，詳細可閱下表：</p>
<p>本年第二季上海工商業異動按月比較表</p>
<p>新創　擴充　收縮　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>四月　五〇　一八　一四　二五三　六七</p>
<p>五月　三二　二〇　七　二三三　三六</p>
<p>六月　二九　一三　八　二二八　七八</p>
<p>合計一一一　五一　二九　七一四　一八一</p>
<p>至各項異動在各業間之分佈，據本所調查統計所得，可列表如下：</p>
<p>本年第二季上海工商業異動分業統計表</p>
<p>按上表觀察，可値注意者有三：一，銀行業有九家攔充，而收縮者僅一家；二，異動最人者為特種事業中之旅館業，飲食業，衛生業，娛樂菜，及販賣業中之飲食品業，其中尤以改組及閉歇之勢為甚；三，一般製造工業仍未能發展，合計新創僅十二家，但閉歇却達三十五家，幾三倍之。茲將四，五，六三月各業異動中之特別重要者，縷述於後，以供參考：（未完）</p>

<p>五時半决賽、哈定在最外綫、其次為曼蒂卡斯、懷愛脫、馬格爾海斯、勞林、最內圈為柏特生、最初二欄六人均同起同落、以後哈定卽漸占優勢、第三轉灣走人直綫後、哈定占先一公尺、懷愛脫緊隨不捨勞林亦在後拼命衝刺、至終點時、哈定仍保持一公尺之距離、奪得第一、勞林以一肩之差、戰敗懷愛脫、複賽成績最優之柏特生、反退居第四、其餘兩人、則落後的十公尺、哈定之成績、為五二秒四、較其本人一九三四年所造成五〇秒六之世界紀錄、及一九三二年所造成五二秒之大會紀錄、均大為减色、</p>

<p>關於改革夸省幣制問題，作者曾於上週在本刊發表「改革粵省幣制芻議」一文，主張：（一）以粵省現存白銀充作現金準備，發行大洋新法幣一萬二千萬元，其保證準備之數，則以中央公債撥充；（一）規定大洋法幣一元折合毫券一元六角之比率，以上項新發行之法幣，遂漸收回毫券一萬九千二百萬元，其餘毫券，則發行整理廣東金融庫券盡量吸收之；（三）規定法幣償還債務辦法：凡一切公私債務，其發生在粵省頒佈集中白銀法令以前者，（前文主張以二十四年十一月三日為劃分債務界綫，係為尊重中央法令起見，惟粵省實施法幣日期絞遲，自可斟酌地方情形，以粵省公布此項法令之日為準，　一律照加四四之比率以國幣償付，其在該日以後發生者，一律照加六之比率以國幣償付；（四）繼續發行大洋法幣一千萬元，以加　之比率，收買民間白銀，全數撥充法幣準備金。惟以上四點，不過為改革計劃中之犖犖大端，至於施行步驟，及詳密辦法，尙須待相當　間之調查與研究，而後始能確定。迨稿成奇交本刊發表後，又見報載財政部孔部長關於整理粵省幣制之談話，綜其談話內容，的可分為四點：（一）整理粵幣，應以粵民全體利害為前提，不應着眼於少數人之損益，更應嚴防過去濫發鈔票及不正當買賣之流弊。（二）粵省毫券信用，應亟謀鞏固，故須先行補充現金準備項下所短百分—七之數額及　成保證準備。（三）俟應辦手續完成後，再由財政部妥定收換辦法，施行法幣。（四）在過渡期間內，一切收付，仍准毫券照常使用，惟一切稅收，如係以中央法幣為本位者，倘無法幣，則應按當日市價，以毫券折合大洋法幣抵繳，但不得超過加五計算。據此：則中央對於整理粵幣，現已定有準確步驟，此後設立中央銀行發行大洋法幣以及集中準備，統一外匯諸端，不過改制中之技術問題，殊無討論之必要。而其中之最大關鍵，當前似尙無斬截辦法者，厥為毫券與大洋折合比率之一點。茲謹就個人管見所及，再申前議，以供研討。</p>
<p>（二）作者論旨</p>
<p>前文主張毫券與國幣折合之比率，定為加六，幷說明照此比率以收回毫券，則粵民不過損失百分之十，而中央政府亦得以措置裕如，實為整理粵幣制兩全之道。顧或有懷疑吾之主張，以為比率（本文所稱比率之高低係指毫洋折合大洋加水之多少而言）過高，無異貶低粵省幣値，深恐因此而致影響物價，减損粵民財產者；實則余之主張，祇係毫券自然貶値，而非毫洋貶値也。茲特再就對外貿易，僑胞匯欽，財產所得，以及物價，財政，產業諸端，分別闡明，以明吾說。惟於此尙有　先决問題：即將來中央在粵初步施行法幣，是否以法幣與毫券在市面同時流通；抑規定一切收付，祇准以法幣行使，而毫券則祗可用以調換法幣。此兩種辦法，雖不過祗有緩進急進之別，實質仍係殊途。惟根據現實狀况，參酌地方輿情，自應以採用緩進方法為宜。今姑假定採用緩進辦法，於新幣制施行後，法幣　毫券幷用，從而說明其所發生之影響如左：</p>
<p>（一）對外貿易　新幣制施行以後，外匯卽吿穩定，减少對外貿易上商人所負担之危險，旣已如前文所述；至於毫券折合國幣比率之高下，對於進出口商人，却無多大損益。蓋粵省對外貿易，無論輸出輸入，多假手外國商行，以毫洋或香港紙幣為本位，與外匯之高下，無甚關係。輸入商人在改制前向國外定貨，貨未售而賬已結者，則所得於售價騰貴之數，可償其幣價貶値之失，是無損亦無益也。貨未售而賬亦未結者，雖失諸結賬時幣價之貶値，而適得於售貨時物價之騰漲，是亦無損無益也。其在改制後始向國外定貨者，則計本售貨，均用新幣或照新幣折算，更無損益之可言。僅在改制前定貨，貨已售而貨欵尙未結收者，始不免蒙受相當損失；惟若以其所得之售價，事前轉購他項貨物，則損益適亦相抵。（父如收賬時，照下文法幣施行辦法辦理，則亦無損無益，）反之：輸出商人在改制前賣貨，貨已出而賬未收者；因貨價未漲而幣價已跌，則不免遭受損失，惟其以港幣為本位者，則亦無損無益。貨未出而賬亦未收，惟已接受定單者亦同。其在改制後始接受定單者，則幣値雖低，而貨價可酌量提高，是亦無益無損也。要之：折合率（卽毫洋與國幣折合比率，以下倣此）之高下，對於輸出人商人，均無多大損益；惟以粵省年來入超之鉅，若稍稍貶低幣値，以促進輸出而抑制輸入，亦為計之得者。特幣値若過度貶低，又使持有毫券者大蒙不利。故權衡兩者之閒，加六之比率，似頗為適當，此余半張低抑毫券價値之第一理由。</p>
<p>（二）僑胞匯欵　我粵同胞，僑居海外者為數極衆，數十年來積其辛勞所得，以匯回祖國者，其數目實在不少。據黃元彬氏之估計，自光緒　年起五十四年來華僑　欵之總數，的為六十二億元，數目之鉅，殊足驚人。卽最近在不景氣期中，每年滙返者，估計仍在二萬萬元以上，其中粵省至少當佔一半，此實為粵省金融及產業上之絕大源泉。我國對外貿易，年年入超，數十年來入超總額的為七十五億元左右，卽最近三年平均，每年仍有五萬　千萬元之鉅，此種國際收支上之大量損失，多賴僑胞匯欵之無形收入以資抵補。查每年僑胞滙歸數目，一方固因其本身經濟環境而有差異，一方則與國際間匯率之高低，亦有密切關連。例如：一九二〇年間世界銀賤風潮，華僑匯欵回粵者以憶萬計，反之：如最近數年余賤時期，其欵匯數目遂比較减少。故中央此次改革粵省幣制，如將毫券價値稍稍貶　，使匯欵回粵者無形中獲得相當利益，短期中卽不　誘致華僑大批匯欵，使粵省金融得以增加活動，資余充裕，產業發展，其有裨於粵省之經濟復與者，實非淺鮮，此又毫券價値應予抑低之第二理由。</p>
<p>（三）財產所得　一家之財產與個人之實際所入，不因幣値之變動而有所增减　亦猶國富實値之多少，不因金銀價格之變動而有所增减也。蓋卽金銀貨幣，亦不過為財富價値之尺度及交換之媒介，離此即失其本身之最大效用。紙幣則更不能與所代表之金銀同日而語。遑論粵省毫券自去歲十一月以至本年六月間濫發以來，實已失其為價值尺度之性質，故毫券價值　低，而財產之價値除毫券本身外，可謂毫無變動。蓋毫券貶値，原為毫券與國幣比率之變動，而非粵省財物與國外省外財物交換比率之變動也。今試再就前文所舉之例以明之，例如：上海出產甲項貨物，廣州出產乙項貨物，甲乙兩項貨物，在上海價格同為國幣一元，在廣州價格同為粵幣一元四角，粵省改制以後，則凡存有乙項貨物者，均可以之在上海出售，得價國幣一元，合粵幣一元六角，是則粵省商人之存有乙項或甲項貨物者，都不因改制之故，而使財物價値有所變更。更從對外貿易方面言之，例如：粵生絲價格，每包値粵幣五百元，美國麥粉　包値美金一百元，其時粵幣對美金之比率，的為一比五（粵幣向未取得外匯上地位，實際不能與美國通匯，此種比率，不過係從別種貨幣換算而來，）則輸出生絲一一包，可得美金一百元，而輸入美麥十包，亦須美金一百元，是生絲一包，可換美麥十包，粵省改制以後，假定粵幣對美金之比率，變為一比六，而生絲價格苟非受貨物本身供需差量之影響，則其價格當不致發生若何變動，亦為美金一百元；是輸出生絲一包，可得粵幣六百元，而輸入麥粉十包，亦需粵幣六百元，粵絲與美麥之交換比率仍無差異，從整個地域經濟方面觀之，粵省全民所有財產之價値，幷不因幣價之起跌，而有所增减。同理：以之反證個人財產所得，則改制以後，除持有毫券者不免損失百分之十外，其餘一般人之名目所得，雖見减少，然因國幣之購買能力，已顯異於前，除零星消費或不免較前稍覺虧損外，實際所得。仍無變更，是又可以斷言也。</p>
<p>（四）物價　物價之漲落，實為貨幣價値起跌之反映。此次改革粵省幣制，若實行貶低毫券價値百分之一，則物價自必隨之而起。然因木省與國內外貨物之交換比率，未嘗變動，則經過一定期間，物價當歸於平，此在前篇已詳論及之。且自法幣政策推行以後，毫券經人為及自然之力量，必然漸被吸收，是毫劵本身已失其為價値尺度之效能，僅可作交易之媒介，寢且離其他物價，而獨自起落，成為有價證券之一種，尙何足以左右物價之高下。至若毫劵全部收回以後，則毫洋（指銀角）除作暫時輔幣以外，已將根本消滅，更不足為幣制統一之梗。故雖定加六之比率以收回毫券，實際上與物價無關，卽與人民之生活無關也。在改制後之　二月內，若患物價無　定之標準，則鄙意以為補救亦非難事，可參酌廣州去年十一月以前六個月平均物價，而以該六個月當中毫洋與國幣之平均比率使折合國幣，更依傍最近期閒國內各大都市之物價，酌為損益，定一最高限制，不許市面上物價過度抬高，轉瞬省內新幣使用普通，而與他省貿易暢通，則般物價自必歸於常態也。</p>
<p>（五）財政　查粵省國家地方兩稅，每年收人的共五千餘萬元，禁絕烟賭及廢除苛雜以後，年收的七八千萬元，除其中一小部分原係以大洋為本位者外，餘俱收受毫洋。此次改制在過渡期中其向以毫洋為本位者，仍以毫券照常收付；向以大洋為本位者，如無大洋法幣，則准照當日行市以毫券折合大洋抵繳；此種辦法，原係顧全現實，體順輿情，自屬適當。惟改制以後，砍求法幣之推行，鄙意以為政府切收付，應以國幣授受，其向以國幣為本位者，自不成問題，其向以毫洋為本位者，則在毫券尙未消滅期內，凡持有國幣一元者，准予抵納捐稅一元六角，以昭公允，此種辦法，在政府稅收方面，雖不免同樣損失百分之十，然此種捐失，為時甚暫，一俟毫劵全部收回（可限定一年或　年之期間，全部收回，然後政府斟酌情形，另定一毫洋與國幣之折合率（此種折合率與毫洋折合率自有分別，大的可定為加四四左右），以為換算標準。比率旣定以後，凡一切向以毫洋為單位之數目，非前時定有契的關係者，無論公私收付，皆可以之折算國幣。（其有契的關係者，可照下文法幣施行辦法辦理，）如此，則政府所受損失為時甚暫，損失旣不甚大，法幣亦賴以推行。况粵省財政，根本巳屬紊亂，際此過渡期間，自須由中央補助。政府力面雖不能不稍有犧牲，而短期內卽可統一幣制，穩定金融，使稅源日趨豐裕，稅收因而增加，是亦計之得老。反之，若徒顧慮目前稅收减損之關係，而定為加五或加三之比率，以收換毫券，不特中央負祖過重，亦非一般粵民之福，其弊可於上文所述對外貿易僑胞滙欵諸端之反面求之。或謂國幣與粵幣之比率屢經更易，恐不足以取信粵民，不知加六之比率，僅係以法幣換回毫劵之比率，而非法幣對毫洋之比率也。蓋毫券自夫歲十一日以至本年六月間濫發以來，已失其代表毫洋之地位，雖可作交易之媒介，而不能作價値尺度之準則。此後政府一切稅收，萬不能因短期間之變動，及前此當局者之亂命，致使其收益减損至毫券跌價之程度（假定中央對於粵陳前時所發之毫券不予維持，則其跌價之程度或將低至五成左右，）其理固甚明也。</p>
<p>（六）產業　此次粵省改革幣制，如果推行順利，使幣制歸於統一，則粵省物價日漸安定，外滙亦趨平穩，投資者自必立見踴躍，金融活動，信用發展，產業亦必日趨發達，此在前篇已論及之惟折合率之高低，究與產業影響如何，是又不可不稍有說明。依作者意見，以為新幣制若果推行順利，使毫券之價格，成為貨幣以外之種有價證券，離其他物價而獨自漲落，則對於粵省工商產業，實無多大影響。惟當新幣制施行後之一兩個月，因毫券貶値，滙價低平之結果，自能刺激產業之發達，有利於粵省原有產業品之輸出。然經過一定期間，因幣制統一之關係，國內物價趨於平穩，則此種利益，必漸歸於消滅，期時產業之衰旺，除本省特殊原因以外，自當　國家經濟政策為轉移。或謂吾國生產事業，尙屬幼稚，一切新興工業，有待於外國機器與原料之輸入者甚多，粵省亦不能例外，故如此次改制，其折合率過高，則牛產成本亦貴，不能與舶來貨品爭衡；不知比率旣高，則外來機器原　雖貴，而舶來品之價格亦因以同時漲高，　方旣不能阻碍輸出（因此種新興工業，其出品在國內市塲雖貴，然在國外則迄無變更），而他方反足以稍稍抑制外貨之傾銷，實有利而無害。此父毫券價値應予抑低之第三理由。</p>
<p>總上以觀，金所主張加六之比率，對於物價，財產所得兩項，都無影響；對於國外貿易，僑胞匯欵，資金活動，以及產業諸端，均屬有利；又能設法避免此後稅收之損失；而其最大之妙用，允在顧全現實，利便法幣之施行，粵民（僅係毫券持有人）所受之損失有限，而政府之負担甚輕（請參閱前文），洵屬兩全之道。反之；若定為加　五或加三之比率，則稅收目前雖不致减損，惟一方中央負担過重，對外人超必致增加，僑胞匯欵因而停滯，資金逃避，信用緊縮，種種不利，層見迭出，其害有不可勝言者矣。</p>
<p>（三）法幣施行辦法</p>
<p>根據余所擬計劃，參照中央意旨，就前篇略加修正，擬定粵省施行法幣辦法如左：</p>
<p>（一）依照二十四年十一月三日財政部公布改革幣制之命令，以中央·中國·交通　銀行所發行之鈔票定為法幣。茲粵省省市兩銀行所發行之銀毫券（包括市立券），除納稅外，所有一切收付，仍准照常行使，但暫以　年為限。</p>
<p>（二）凡政府一切收付，概以中央法幣為限，人民繳納稅捐，得以法幣元抵繳毫洋一元六角，但暫以年為期，逾期另定比率。</p>
<p>（三）凡銀錢行號商店及其他公私機關或個人，持有上項銀奄券者，准以毫券一元六角調換中央法幣一元之比率，持赴中央銀行廣東分行無限制兌換法幣。自後一切收付，除法幣及毫券外，不得行使外幣或現金；違者全數沒收。</p>
<p>（四）舊有以毫洋（或稱廣東毫銀）或毫券（或稱廣東法幣）單位訂立之契的，應照原定數額，按當日卽訂立契的日毫洋或毫券折合國幣之比率換算國幣，於到期日概以中央法幣結算收付。如契的所定之給付，係按期計算者，在契的關係存續中，均應以原訂立契的日之折台率結算。</p>
<p>前項折合率槪不　超過加六，不得少過加三，由廣東省財政廳調查核定，另行公佈之。（作者按：此項折合率之公佈，可自民國十五年起至本法施行日之前一日止，如在一年間或月內價格無甚變動者，卽以該年或該月之平均折合率為其全年或全月之折合率，以省麻煩。如變動甚大，卽應按每日折合率公佈。至其在民國十五年以前者，則可統一劃一之比率）</p>
<p>訂立契的之當事人，如雙方同意，仍得以毫劵結算收付。</p>
<p>（五）二十四年十一月三日財政部公布之改革幣制法令，除本法別有規定者外，均適用之。</p>
<p>（四）銀二紙六之解釋</p>
<p>前交主張改制後第二步計劃，繼續發行大洋法幣三千萬元，以加二之比率，收買民間白銀；卽法幣一元，調換銀角一元二角。顧或者遂以為吾之改制計劃，所定國幣與粵幣之比率，忽而加六，忽而加二，（簡稱銀二紙六）未免矛盾。不知毫劵之地位，旣不能代表毫洋，已如上述，則其價格更不能與現銀相比，其理亦明。本年在施行管理貨幣制度之今日，中央法幣已成不兌現紙幣，是則夸幣之價格，亦不應着眼於貨幣之成色或其現金準備，作者亦曾考慮及此，惟以信用經濟尙未十分發達之我國今日，社會上一般人士之心理，仍斤斤着眼於現金準備之多少，其關係於貨幣之信用者甚大。本年六月間財部宣言，亦卽有見及此，而為所以鞏固幣制穩定金融之表示。粵省毫券，若眞以其準備之多少而定其價格之高下，則實際價格，不過等於原來四成三左右，卽毫券一元，的等於法幣三角六分（見前文）；今以加六之比率換算，是毫券一元等於法幣六角三分，已比原來增高百分之七上五（其計算式已見前文）。可知加六之比率，亦非全着眼於其準備金之多少，而實為統籌　顧之道。至於法幣一元調換銀角一元二角，其理由不外根據前文所述之兩點：一則係比照上海市價，二則係使與毫券價格跌落之程度，互相適應。今試以算式證明之如左：</p>
<p>據此：則毫券一元僅値銀角七角五分，是毫劵價格，跌落至原來價格白分之七十五，而非貶値一成。不知粵省自頒布集中白銀命令以後，以毫券一元二角，收買銀角一元，是其時毫券價格，早已跌落至十二分之十，今以十二分之十除七角五分，其得數仍為九角。</p>
<p>是毫劵價格，實際不過貶低百分之十，與前文兩式計算所得之結果，亦無少異。是可知銀二紙六之比率，實有深意存乎其間者也。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>總合余之改制計劃，一方旣係根據維護人民法益及减輕政府負担之兩大原則：而他方更考慮其對於國外貿易，僑胞滙欵，財產所得，以及物價產業，財政諸方面所發生之影響，以為决策。最後更依據法理，參配地方輿情，以定法幣施行之辦法。而其着眼點尤在闡明粵幣之地位，解釋毫券不足以代表毫洋，所定加六之比率，僅係以法幣換回毫券之比率，而非法幣對毫洋之比率，主張先定一年或二年之期間，徹底消滅毫券，再行逐漸廢除毫洋單位，旣可免除中央過重負担，復能兼顧粵民一般福利，雖非萬全之道，要亦穩健之策。然而事關改制大計，一切施行步驟，與及切實辦法，自有待於政府與國人之詳密研討。關於發行新幣，募集公債諸端，本文槪不贅論，惟折合率一層，鄙意以為中央此次因體念粵民痛苦，定為最高加五，已屬特別遷就，若定為加三或加二五，其害其大，不敢茍同。而筆者個人主張，則以為應分別粵幣之性質而定其比率，仍以白銀（指銀角）加二，毫洋（此處所稱毫洋，幷非　種實物，　係用以表示粵省原來所用之貨幣單位，卽粵　所稱毫銀本位是也）加四四，毫券加六之比率，較為介當也。</p>

<p>己時已過午時中，小乖姐送飯過田冲，我問乖姐什麽菜，橫切蘿蔔直切葱，一砲燉蛋擱常中。</p>
<p>遠望乾姐那廂來，手裏拿着紅綉鞋，我問乖姐怎麽賣？只賣鮮花不賣鞋，留着綉鞋做招牌。</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>有一位英國醫生，主張每天早餐前喝一杯淡和的熱茶，在身心兩方面都有莫大利益。他說：「曾有一位著作家把他的成名歸功於早餐前的一杯茶。還有許多飲食專家對於這種習慣，也很贊成的，因為在早餐前喝一杯淡和的茶，不但能彀刺激腹內的器官，而且可以使頭腦更加淸醒，不過素有胃弱症的人，或患慢性消化不良者，郤不能有這種習慣，因為他們是絕對不能喝茶的。假使你在臥床旁邊的桌上，放一套火酒爐子和一隻茶吊子，那麽在起身之後，就可以自己熱一杯茶喝了。</p>
<p>「中國茶比印度茶好，因為中國茶不像印度茶般的濃烈，我們所喝的茶最好是十分淡和而不加牛乳的，倘若仿俄國式，在茶裏加一薄片檸檬，那倒不妨。早餐中不宜有茶，每餐有肉吃時更不宜喝茶。肉與茶在一起是不大好的，而且是釀成不消化症的主要原因之一。但是很少有人注意及此，時常看見他們一邊喝茶，一邊吃豐盛的菜肴。</p>
<p>一午後喝一杯茶，也是很有益的，不過不能和許多夾肉麵包或糕餅麵食一同吃。我們所喝的茶都要熱，因為茶中含有旦奪（鞣酸），這是一種有收歛性的酸，在冷的時候，作用最大。睡前喝茶是毫無理由的，因為茶是一種有力的刺激物。一個人臨睡時喝了茶，常淸醒而不能入睡。這時候喝一杯熱開水，倒可以帮助消化的。</p>
<p>「用茶作嗽口水是最好的嘗試。錫蘭印度等栽植茶樹地方上的土人，不但喝多量的茶，而且把冷茶葉來淸潔仙們的牙齒。茶葉中所含的酸能堅强齒齦（俗稱牙肉），保護牙齒的。</p>
<h3 id="c183">碧蘿春 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>碧蘿春，誰都知道是一種洞庭東山出產的名貴茶葉，可稱為聞名中外。可是產量不多，而且到茶市上市的時節，全由幾家所謂「出客人家」包買了去。他們去作送人的禮物，或是由遠路的親戚託了代收的。市上茶店所出賣的碧蘿春，呌我們東山人的眼光看來，可說十有八九都是別種茶葉冒充的。</p>
<p>碧蘿春的名貴，是由於製得彎曲，細得像針尖，而且有着一層白色的毛，泡開來碧綠淸香，飲後津津有餘味，如啖橄欖先澀而後甜，沉於杯底，一旗一槍，根根剛像樹上採上來的相仿。</p>
<p>此茶製法，跟別地方的不同，用着煮飯的鑊子，製時先將鑊子用烈火燒熱，然後「撲靑」。（據說撲靑時的錢子燒得越熱越好，茶葉上的一層白毛，全在於撲靑時的鑊子熱度關係。）撲下速用雙手上下翻動，翻至茶葉漸漸發現潮濕時，灶裏的火暫時緩緩地停止，此時用雙手掌搓揉，搓成團狀再放散，搓至鑊熱度低了，灶裏冉加把柴，如此一鑊須經過五六十次的搓揉加柴，加柴和搓揉的手法，才成功了幾兩碧蘿春。總之東同的碧蘿春，完全靠着緩勻的文火跟搓揉的手法。</p>
<p>可惜我們東山茶樹，並不大量地種植，祗是莊戶人家的副產品，有的還是山中野生的，有的利用着果園邊的空地種幾株，除了頭批茶出賣外，以後所採的都留作自家的飲料用。</p>

<p>— 鍾嶽</p>
<p>久住在都市的人，再也想不到鄕間有這樣的消閒處所——茶館。</p>
<p>只要是人口稍密的村鎭，就能找到茶館，二家以至六七家不等。這種茶館，房屋狹窄，桌椅破舊，房屋大概都是兩進，第一進的後檐高出一些，以便陽光射入，和第一進的屋連着，中間並沒有天井，在第進的裏間，放着一隻很大的煤灶。並排淸的檯上，放些茶壺茶杯等什物，煤爐的橫對面，置一隻小缸，以作小便之用，</p>
<p>（因茶客儘量喝茶，小便也相當的多）在外間和裏間放上十幾副破舊的方桌和長凳，這樣鄕村茶館的設備齊全了。</p>
<p>在每天早七五六點鐘，老澱兼茶博士忙着起身，開排門，拉煤爐，烟霧煤灰頓時佈滿全屋，使人透不過氣來。接着茶客們跚跚其來，睡眼惺忪的檢位坐下，茶博士用漆黑的抹布揩着檯凳，然後泡茶，附帶一個傳染沙眼的面盆和手巾，茶客很正經的揩面，還把面巾充作牙刷之用，茶剛倒下，即見沉澱許多脚汁，水的淸潔與茶葉的好壞，可見一斑。有些茶客上茶館，帶了自備的茶壺，他講衛生嗎？（為何不帶茶杯）不是的，因他臨走的時候，可呌茶房冲上一壺滾然的茶，不另取費，帶回給老婆兒子們享用。茶客漸漸來多了，茶館頓時活躍起來，鄕人對於又麻將的興趣，不亞於都市的人，雖然目不識丁，但對一萬，二萬，東，南，西，北，全都認識，不差毫厘的。檯的四邊，圍滿了作壁上觀的人，一時劈拍嘈雜之聲，不絕於耳。還有幾個人圍坐一張檯上，放大了喉嚨，你一句我一句的說倘不休，這就所謂「吃講茶」，鄕人有一種脾氣，一有爭吵的事，動輙上茶館評理，一言不合，大演全武行，拍檯擊凳，拋壺擲杯，沒有旁人調解，戰爭决不停止，所以茶館的檯凳壺杯，有缺角的，跛足的，殘破不堪就是這個緣故！</p>
<p>一到晌午時間，茶客均一鬨而散。</p>

<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>儲蓄是美德，這是大衆所公認的，因為無論何人，總有逢到急迫需用的時候，在富有的人，固然不生問題，但在現今的社會間泰半都是經濟不裕的人，或者藉勞工度日的，那末遇到急需的時候，祗有向人借貸的一法，但向人借貸，有無又是不能確定的，惟有儲蓄才能解决這困難問題，從前的儲蓄，是拿白銀或銀元，藏在家里，或埋在地下，很是危險或不便利，現在好了，各銀行都辦有儲蓄一部，各人儘自己的收入，酌量提出一部分作為儲蓄，可以將欽送存到銀行裏去，但也要存入可靠的銀行，以免損失，現在把關於儲蓄一則小故事，寫在下面，以博一粲。</p>
<p>從前有某甲，雖貧而好飲酒，終日沉湎麴蘗，得錢旣買醉酒家，卽懷中無資，也要向各酒家賒欠，所以每逢年節，各酒家的酒帳，每難償付，甲妻屢勸不聽，怨恨異常，後來想得一策，限某甲祗准在家吃酒，並須經伊親自現欽去購，甲無奈允之，由是甲妻每往沽酒時，便從中提出欵項若干，私自存儲，日久積少成多，甲却不知此中玄奧，及年終，各酒家又紛紛來索舊欠酒帳，甲無法應付，將出走避債，甲妻曰：床角有儲金，速交出！結果淸償還有餘欵，甲問儲欵何來？甲妻吿以故，因深感妻的儲蓄妙計，能解債務痛苦，對伊便增加了不少情感。</p>
<p>上述的故事，雖無關宏指，但可以知道儲蓄的切要，是人人應當奉行的了。</p>

<p>夢蘭倒楚呆了一呆，見母親始終是那樣凝神的望着，倒忽然笑起來，因道：媽，你看我這種樣子，像了個什麽人？江太太怎好說是他像新娘子，便笑道：道孩子說什麽傻話？無論穿什麽衣服，你總還是你。夢蘭搖搖頭道：不，人的相貌，雖然是不會變，但是人的衣服，若和他平常的樣子差多了，那就變了一個人了。那些當偵探的人，士農工商，什麽樣子的人都做全了，不就為了他能够隨時隨地都可以改換面目，另變成一個人嗎？江太太道：那怎麽能把偵探打比呢？他們是會化裝。夢蘭笑道：這些我都不管了，反正我覺得這樣一來，像一樣東西了。很像上海繡衣店，那玻璃窗子裏作的人體模型。他說着，站得挺直，把兩隻人垂直了，臉子也扳住了，呆呆的站定，的莫有兩分鐘。江太太先還不知道所以然，一會子回想過來了，便笑道：這這孩子淘氣，把新衣服脫下來罷，不要弄髒了。夢蘭道才一扭身子笑道：這不是很像嗎？旣是你呌睨，我就脫下了。江太太坐在靠窗戶的一把椅子上，對姑娘看去，多少是感到一點無聊，很不在意的，蔣手邊書桌的靠邊抽屜，扯了開來。在那抽屜的閂眼裏，還挿了一把鑰匙呢。夢蘭看到，就搶過來，把抽屜推進去，而且將鑰匙一轉，鎖了起來。然後把鑰匙揑到手裏，紅了臉道：請你老人家，不要看我的抽屜。江太太這倒楞住了，望了他道：為什麽不能看？一個作小姐的人。還有什麽事，要瞞着母親的嗎？夢蘭慢慢的脫下了衣服，有五分鐘之久，然後答道，你老人家要看也可以，看到之後，請你不要見怪，那很不吉利。說着，他把鑰匙又交給了江太太，然後自己藏到垂下來的那半邊帳子裏去，換下繫着的紅裙子。江太太道：我知道，你這抽屜裏，並沒有什麽，故意裝出這個樣子來，惹我生氣的，我也懶說你了，越用好話勸你　你是越要生氣。他說了這話，也就自動的出門下樓去了。夢蘭見母親走了，一人坐在帳子裏，更是一動不動，順手在枕頭下面，抽出一塊繡花紡綢手絹來。因為手摸着枕頭，觸起了他睡眠的思想，就倒在枕頭上了。在兩小時以後，小蘭上變來，請他下樓去吃午飯。却見帳子外面，仲出小姐的兩隻脚，鞋子都沒有脫呢。（六七）</p>

<p>是一間廣大的長方形的屋子，白色壁，白色頃，白色燈球，給迷濛在薄霧裏的月兒似的，可是有着長長的兩行列。四葉電風在頭頂上打廻旋，把一點座客的談笑旋混在一起了。這裏百餘張小方桌全被都市中的悠閒分子佔據着。有洋行職員，有地皮掮客，有大學生，有愛好文藝的靑年，有老資格作家，有工程師，有閨閣名媛和交際花，有名妓和舞女。……</p>
<p>靠洋台懸着草綠色的窗慢，小方桌的布毯有米色的，橙黃色的，天藍色同，也有跟窗幔一樣的草綠色，那麽柔和的色調呵的。</p>
<p>這和古老的什麽「樓」，什麽「園」的品茗處，顯然有着不同的風格和趣味。這種充溢着各式各樣人的動態。不必限資格，不必問身價，祇消懷着一顆悠閒的心，跑進去揀一張桌子坐下，隨便地，向南國侍役要一壺紅茶或靑茶，接受他塊冷箱裏拿出的面巾，隨意的擦一擦鼻子或抹一採手。</p>
<p>點板烟斗，燃烟捲，折火柴，看新聞紙的副刋，靜默擬腹稿，合先令行市，談影片主角的優點，等候密友……各隨自己的需要。白衣侍役不會如其他塲所的用過分巴結的手段來纏。一杯香茗，一支烟草，一碟點心，會忘掉外邊鎔化了的柏油路，和路上怨忙着來去的人……</p>
<p>托點心盤子的，全是穿湖色長衣的，有着健康形體的少女，白色的圍身，那樣兩支長長的飄帶貼在腰背後，呌每個座客發生着輕快感。又燒包子，太極糕，鷄肉燒賣……從伊們白晳纖嫩的手裏送到面前，每客五分是感到極度的便宜了。這樣，會使一個消化不良症患者，漸漸增進食慾。塗克羅蜜的白亮的水果車，柔軟的橡皮輪從這一角滾到那一角。梨子，紫葡萄，Sunkist……有着新鮮的色澤，白瓷碟和牙柄小銀刀，由有着一頭烏黑鬈髮的女郞手裏遞過來，或者，由伊親手剖一隻梨子，你將會體味到孤獨並沒有枯澀！</p>

<p>— 孟傳安</p>
<p>十八日本刊載有舍利君「廣州的茶樓」一文，惜言之未詳，與事實亦稍有出入，今據所知者，拉雜寫來，狗尾之續，祈勿見譏也。</p>
<p>粵人嗜茶成癖，每日不至茶樓叙，卽覺不適，故茶樓應時而起，多如過江之鯽，無論大街小巷，必有三四點綴其間，而其種類可分為四，日「茶樓」「茶室」「茶居」「茶寮」</p>
<p>茶樓設於繁盛馬路中，建築偉大，陳設輝煌，茶具精巧，點心可口，茶資稍昂，間或請省港著名之女伶，輪流歌唱，（如月兒，奔月，華娘等卽出身其間，亦由此成名，）淸歌一曲，以娛來賓，前排座位，每盅五角至一元，非經濟充足者，不敢嘗試。最著名之茶樓如西濠口之「陶然」，惠愛馬路之，惠然，」粵秀路之「越秀」小北門外之「紅棉」長堤之「一景二大三元」等是。</p>
<p>茶室多賃樓上開業，佈置雅潔，座位無多，茶資分五分一角兩種，所製之包點，玲瓏適口，荼博士招待亦週到。此中最著名之茶室，為公園前之「公園茶室」惠愛東路之「五月花」等，茶客多學界中人。</p>
<p>茶居設於小馬路，範圍狹小，佈置簡單，而茶資非常便宜，每盅不過分二，分八，二分四，點心如又燒包，蝦餃，燒賣，粉果，馬拉糕，等每碟二件亦不過二分而已，一般經濟家多往就之，如中華北路之「又棧茶居」中央紀念堂前之「德宜茶居，」為彼中之俊俊者。</p>
<p>茶寮多設於窮山僻鄕間，臨溪而築，以茅為蓬，一桌一几，別有風趣，多用泉水烹茶，泉水甘冽，故茶芬芳，確非城市所能及。故久居城市者流，轉其目光，多向茶寮中品茶談心，每逢假日，則闢室竹戰，如小北門外寶漢路之「大寶漢」「小寶漢」等，車水馬龍，生涯極盛。</p>
<p>「茶樓上穿梭似地忙着的是賣各種點心的小販，」此實舍利君誤會，彼往來遞送點心者初非小販，乃茶主人所雇堂倌。（茶博士）專司招待容人，點心亦非堂倌所自賣，全間營業完全茶主人一手經營，點心每碟二件（只鷄球大飽皮蛋酥等一件）粵市茶規，點心可退，未食者可不計數；而滬市茶樓如「陶陶」新「雅」等則原碟計算，不能退回，此外省茶客，所不能不知者。</p>

<p>補給體中最要之免毒素吞喰淋菌務使片甲不留</p>
<p>淋病之所以自古目為難治，蓋以其病原菌與其他菌體不同。旣富於抵抗力，又易於繁殖。其傳染也，不潔性交後初黏附尿道口，於是其人尿道口，卽有白色粘液，分泌不淸。數日後淋菌自一為二，自二為四，繁殖不已，侵入尿道中，卽有茶綠色之濃液排出，小便混濁，莖痛如割，龜頭及包皮等處，均發生炎衝症狀。此為前尿道淋；斯時其毒素已進入血中，茍不卽時服以「克淋濃」撲滅血中之菌毒，而補給體中之免毒素則淋菌流竄各部。不僅後尿道淋之攝護腺炎，睪丸炎膀胱炎，接踵而起。而腎臟炎之輸尿管閉塞，關節炎之癱瘓，虹彩及結膜炎目盲，皆紛至沓來矣。</p>
<p>蒙製劑「補女容」，此藥能旺盛內分泌，促使靑春腺之正常發育，及規復卵巢機能上建全之功，效服「補女容」後，能在短期內使月經調順，而達催孕生育之目的。嘗有一馬姓女士，結婚八載，從未生育，夫婦感情冰炭，其夫籍口嗣育，疑另納小星。其月經異常紊亂，且經來血量少而暗淡，此卵巢機能失常，及卵泡刺激</p>
<p>論及淋病原因療法之「克淋儂」內服，以補給體中免毒素，讀者必將詫為未之前聞；而私謂以前所服各藥，從無此項効能；由是竊嘆已所患淋疾，實因劣藥致誤而化慢者！其實，讀者固只知其一，不知其二蓋余在莫斯科著名醫院實。習時，卽早已賞用「克淋儂」查其藥乃由德人彼得氏於動植物類脂肪中抽出之Lipoid，侶以純凈色素精煉而成。功擅亢進人體之强大防病免毒機能，無論男女何種急慢淋濁白帶（婦女可兼外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥），以及併發症如前述各種疾患，服之自半打至十瓶許，無有不從根全治者，且一無流弊。故在歐西各國，早已風行，吾華因醫學不發達，故近年來始行傳入，今後對於國人之患淋者，無異一福星降臨也。</p>

<p>—催孕必先調經—</p>
<p>凡是卵巢健全，巢泡刺戟素不缺之婦女，其對於月經亦必調整，而無超前落後之苦，若在處女時代，則發育平勻，絕無畸形之象，至結婚則受孕亦極易，惟有一般發育不全，如臀部乳房瘦削萎癟，面色萎黃，肌肉鬆弛，則此女子之月經，必甚凌亂，雖久姙仍不得孕，大凡月經不調，久婚不孕婦女，其身體必甚纖弱，如頭痛，目眩耳鳴，性情變異，易怒易哭，喜怒無常白帶下注，終於成為可懼之歇斯的里症。不僅月經失調停孕不育已也。</p>
<p>故調經催孕之根本方針，必須服梅倫氏發明之女用賀爾戟素缺乏所致，乃進服「補女容」四星期後，適又値經期，幸血量已增多而色亦殷然鮮艷，仍囑服勿惙，前後計服至六星期，經水按期而至，且有正常之血量，其不發育之乳房，亦達正常肥圓之狀態，肌肉細膩如凝脂。越一年果夢熊羆，今一子已二歲，夫婦愛情日密，其夫納妾之舉，早已打消矣。</p>

<p>遺精早洩，是一般性神經衰弱者，最易遭遇之疾患，此症一朝不痊，則人生即損失一天之幸福，不但此也，且因此陷生命於危險之境。考此等症狀之由來，多不外靑春發育期，犯了手淫或早婚房事過度，首將靑春腺破壞，致失去生理上之建全機能，興奮神經中樞，射精神經中樞，悉脫軌道而易於過放的興奮，故一觸即發，毫無樂趣，快感亦因此而减少而漸歸消滅，精神肉體受此雙重之壓迫，故身體困弱更甚，如頭痛失眠，腰酸脚軟無力，心跳，記憶力銳减，貧血面黃唇白，爪甲無光等症，紛然並起矣。</p>
<p>此等症狀旣由性神經衰弱而起，自不得不作積極的根本治療，而最適當之療法無過於內服「補體康」一方輔以靜電療法，則厥疾自可除去矣。性邁而西愛路之膠石天君，本一勇建靑年，後在校中為同學所嬲，遂犯自凟惡癖，成遺精早洩之患。迭服補品，了無功效，而身體日尪，終以腦力不齊，被迫綴學，乞余醫治，經用科學方法檢查之下，見其靑春腺十分萎墜，下部亦不見發育，乃趨進服大量「補體康」旺盛其靑春腺及挽救其衰弱，並服「耐斯遺精片」治其遺精，後再用電療」經過四五星期之努力治療，遺精早洩之次數，旣由疎而獲完全治愈，由遺精早洩而來之疾患，亦俱獲痊，下部日趨發達，檢查靑春腺確已健全。仍進某校繼續攻讀，以完成學業云。</p>

<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>（一）問：請述明癆病的定義　並第一第二第三各期症狀</p>
<p>癆病之定義，自廣義言之：凡為結核菌作崇之疾患，皆可謂為癆病。如淋巴腺結核，脊椎及關節結核，肺結核，皆是。就中以肺結核最多，故今日所言癆病，多帶有狹義性質，指結核一端而言。肺結核亦簡稱肺病。</p>
<p>肺病之進行雖緩，然其變化亦最速。故欲以常情恒其輕重，而定其屬於某一期，則殊類刻舟求劍，膠柱鼓瑟。且强分某一期者，乃係舊說。故今日最新科學醫師，多不問肺病人已至何期，而惟予以堅决之有效治療。不過大較言之，初期症狀為食减身疲，此為肺尖加答兒症之現象。第二期則有咳嗽咯血，胸痛潮熱等。第三期即見大咯血高熱，孱瘦失眠，心跳等。而通常肺病人亦均有神經衰弱之失眠症，婦女多有月經不調。據余多年研究，及世界著名肺病醫師之臨床實驗，在許多藥物中，惟有徒梅博士之「補肺拿爾」，最著抗菌滅癆之功，有病治病，無病防癆。確擅止血寗咳，收斂盜汗而退虛熱，以及健胃强身等偉效。最好以「補肺拿爾」與男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」同時進服，以補腦補血，增旺體力，則失眠心跳，健忘暈眩等，即獲全部瘳愈。且「補體康」善治陰萎，早洩，腰痛，如有遺精，可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」。「補女容」又能調經，及治一切月經病。如有白帶，可兼外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥。如此面面顧到，則肺病一二月後，即可痊愈不發矣。</p>
<h3 id="c194">白帶病之新療法 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>可在家自療，免勞醫生麻煩</p>
<p>白帶乃婦女最易見之病患，多由自凟與粗暴房事，擦傷陰道，致內部炎腫糜爛，白垢淋漓，小腹作痛，月經因而不調，受姙不易，伉儷之情，由冷淡，而破裂，患者恒精神挹鬱，羞於啟齒，不肯延醫診療，身體困頓，豐姿日削，憔悴不堪。</p>
<p>據余年來經騐所得，婦女對於白帶，並非可慮之病，亦不必定至醫生之門始可獲治，因現在已有德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一藥問世，有防腐止泌殺菌之功，雅宜在家自療，可免赴醫家求治之煩。用法可於每晚睡前納此藥一片於陰道中，次晨洗去，毫無任何烈性刺戟，於數星期內即可將白帶排除，即不再發。惟此病亦有先由丈夫傳染淋病而來者，宜兼服「克淋儂」，以除深部之淋菌。其因體虛而致白帶及月經不調，不姙者，宜同時購服「補女容」以調經血壯身，如此雙管齊下，標本兼治，則收尤速，歷經實騐多人，奏效卓著，實女界之新福音也。</p>

<p>— 滬南平民醫院院長鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>時序入秋，夜凉似水，偶不經意，則感冒潛來，而欬咳作矣，夫欬咳為帶有頑固性之疾患，藥治失當，或誤服劣藥，則成為痼疾，久咳不愈，肺臟壞損，遂轉癆傷，以致危殆，痰為百病之源，其起因亦多由於傷風，致令氣管發炎，痰液若不根除，則氣管擴張，成為痰臭症，每每誘發肺炎而頓死，其他變症則為百日咳，哮喘等。「補肺拿爾」為化痰除咳之唯一藥劑，其消弭氣管炎症，效力最宏，故無論何種欬患服之均奏美效，尤其此藥善除頑痰，故凡傷風，小兒百日咳，哮喘，久咳等，一經購服，即能於三星期至八星期左右，澈底根瘳。</p>

<p>— 武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>消化器官，包括口腔，唾腺，胃臟及腸等，而以胃為主要臟器。因胃司食物之取納，胃若罹病，則食物無所容受，影響全身營養。故胃病則其他消化器亦俱病，而嘔吐，噁心，嘈雜胸悶，見食生厭，噯氣吐酸之胃症，必伴發口苦口臭，與腸蠕進緩滯之大便秘結，多屁等，凡此消化器各病，以强胃為本，本治則諸恙自除。故以服德國「强胃精」一藥為主。「强胃精」不特善治以上各症。又兼善療缺乏維他命B之脚氣賬，蓋以其含有大量維他命B耳。</p>
<h3 id="c197">手淫症自療法　遺精病有淺深之不同療法當然亦各異 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路通和銀行對過</p>
<p>遺精病雖有由於先天不足，內分泌機能衰弱。然大抵皆為手淫所引起。故遺精病亦可包括於手淫症中。手淫症之症象，乃係頭暈，頭痛，健忘，失眠，心悸，思考力及判斷力衰薄等，而其主徵則為遺精症。遺精亦有淺深之不同。通常為夢精症，漸進而為無夢滑精症，更進則成早洩。此時性神經衰弱已極，輸精管疲弊不堪，不能控制精液，所以又有精液漏症，即用力或大小便後，精液點滴涓流。主治以向中西大藥房購服「耐而斯遺精片」為最。</p>
<p>不過療法亦有多端，要之，由手淫而來之遺精，須鎭攝其腦神經，增强其意志，則手淫自戒。遺精藥多數只能固精，而不能兼除手淫，獨「耐而斯遺精片」有增强意志戒止手淫之偉效，服之四五瓶左右，即獲根斷，而各種遺精症，亦獲痊瘳。如因性神經過度衰弱，陰萎腎虧，性發育不全，包皮等而發生之遺精，除服「耐而斯遺精片」外，可兼服「補體康」以旺盛內分泌，增加腎部發育，則諸恙自除。又如因肺病或急性淋病所致之遺精，除服「補肺拿爾」療肺或「克淋儂」除淋外，仍以進服「耐而斯遺精片」鞏固輸精管及兼服「補體康」旺盛內分泌機能為佳！</p>
<h3 id="c198">制伏執拗淋病 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 日本帝國大學醫科陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>以何療法最為有效？　是從前未曾解決問題！</p>
<p>從前有人以為淋病可勿藥而愈，亦有人謂淋雖藥而亦不能愈。其實皆為極端之論。不過淋病之執拗，固是事實，淋病而不醫治，實為自誤，其服藥而不愈者，實因未有特效藥以問世也。然自有德人彼得氏竭其數十年苦心研究結果，發明「克淋儂」之特效藥後，從前視為不能醫治之淋病，至此遂根本推翻。因「克淋儂」一藥係用黃色素與蛋白體混合製劑，服後即能在體內發生抗毒素，而奏殺菌減淋作用，此種作用，是在全身而不限於局部。凡有淋菌踪跡所在，此殺菌作用立見發生。故不損害健全部分，而執拗頑固之淋菌，遂全被「克淋儂」所制伏而根治矣，然從前舊法，僅注意於局部透膜殺菌，豈知淋菌為善竄之微生物，反使病勢擴大，而增治療上之困難，故遠不及「克淋儂」之被包圍殺菌法之迅速而完全也。</p>
<p>惟淋病患者，有許多已經結婚，而一次同房，即能將淋菌傳染其妻子，往往其妻子受傳染後，不知不覺，隔一二月始行發見白帶者，故丈夫自身之淋病雖已治愈，但妻子之淋毒未淸，未幾仍重新傳染于丈夫，而前功盡棄矣。安全之療法，宜同時治療，如一旦覺妻子已有淋毒性白帶，或子宮淋，陰道淋時，除內服「克淋儂」外，一方用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除白帶，可於三四星期中治愈之。此亦制伏執拗淋病之極佳療法也。</p>
<h3 id="c199">一個可注意之淋病再發症 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫大宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>奇！淋病好了三年之後，忽又因大醉之後而復發。怪</p>
<p>患者秦平君，三年之前曾患淋病，據述曾經治愈，但平日仍異常恪守衛生，於房事飲酒運動等，均其注意，故未有他變，僅於做事疲勞時，徵覺尿液溷濁耳。前年因友人結婚，秦君亦被邀入席，以為夙症多年未發，故從飲無度，泥醉而歸。侵晨，小便忽覺熱辣而刺痛，尿中淋系如絮，方司舊病未除而變發。疉服淸濁及透膜殺菌之藥而無聊效，遷延三四月後，反而變成睪丸炎。遂由同事王金寳君介紹，至余處治療，除令安靜用提睪帶外，同時投以「克淋儂」使體內發生抗淋殺菌作用，則散布各處淋菌，自可一鼓受擒，而作徹底之解决，果服至三星期後，睪丸腫痛全消，惟尿仍覺微有濁點，繼服至二星期左右，始淸瑩無垢，秦君恐仍未根治，另乞其他醫師行血淸檢查，前後達十數次之多，並無淋毒的反應。後又行劇烈運動酣飲等刺戟，仍無淋病的變動，於是始信根治。按秦君從前之病，表面上雖已獲痊，而實際上則淋菌仍潛藏深部，故身體疲勞時，即見尿液溷濁可證，若仍服一般局部透膜殺菌藥，僅能姑息獲一時的平靜，日後必仍一再的復發，故非服「克淋儂」决難獲痊也。</p>

<h3 id="c200">對於我國復興承蒙日本關切 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日太平洋學會開第六屆大會，首由中國代表胡適博士，發表演說，略謂，中國任何政府，凡力足以統一國家，而增强國家之地位者，皆非日本所能容忍，此在日本殆已成為國策云云。日本代表聞之，當卽起立反對，並聲明當於明日逐點加以答辯，我想日本在關外，在華北，這樣橫暴情勢之下，欲强辯日本並不反對我國的統一，確有難於自圓其說之苦，故不得不預先聲明，當於明日逐點加以答辯，並不如說書者流，大賣關子，「明日請早」事同一例也。</p>
<p>自經過一宵深思熟慮考量之後，我想芳澤先生，必定有一番冠冕堂皇的絕妙好詞發表，果然這一篇絕妙好詞，於前日報上公佈出來了，其答辯的重要關頭，約有三點，（一）中日同種同文，對於我國復興甚為關切，（二）日本並不反對我國統一，（三）日本反對我國統一，是我國自己不好。</p>
<p>其第一點，我國因與日本近在咫尺，且屬同文同種，確眞承蒙日本關切，受惠實多，以前的不算，九一八之役，是承蒙日本之關切也，一二八之役，是承蒙日本之關切也，優容一般漢奸浪人，搗亂華北政局，是承蒙日本之關切也，各處之「自由賣買」，我不說走私，是承蒙日本之關切也，飛機塲强行建築，軍隊無限增加，這無一而不蒙日本所關切。</p>
<p>其第二點，他說並不反對我國統一，拿什麽當證據呢？諾，他說數月以前，廣東陳濟棠失敗下野，廣東南京，復行團結，由是觀之，日本固未嘗阻礙中國之統一也，其實陳濟棠之失敗下野，胥由於粵省軍入自心之覺悟，不肯操同室之戈，而為漁翁所利用，此固日本所愛莫能助，而實戀戀不能忘情者也，故陳濟棠之下野，與日本無關，絕不足以證明日本並不反對我國統一的證據，此眞所謂隔靴搔癢之說也。</p>
<p>其第三點，謂中國屢次提高關稅，破壞對日條約義務，尤以不顧一九零五年議定書，而在滿洲建造南滿並行錢為甚，這種說法，便為反對我國統一，破壞我國統一之根據，要之提高關稅，和减輕關稅，原屬獨立國家的絕對自由，决不受任何國家所拘束，並且提高關稅，也並不是僅對日本一，國關稅提高，而其餘各國，均為例外，何以他國並不出而反對，而獨日本藉此為借端殺人呢？至於建築與南滿路並行綫，則以我國之土地，建築我國的鐵道，亦屬絕對自由，這是何因缘而竟開罪於日本如是之深，實亦深所不解者也。</p>
<p>芳澤先生又謂，回憶華盛頓會議，簽訂九國公約，保障中國領土完整，日本是所發起，此事是否為日本所發起，尙待考證，卽使日本發起，是否日本別有會心，尙不可知，然此事固當感謝，但試問九一八之後，種種破壞我國土地完整之事件，究為何國破壞之？國聯盟的，究為何國撕毀之？恐芳澤先生雖有百喙，亦不能為之妙解矣。我國僑胞，一批一批驅遣回國，而反謂華僑之在日本者，到處受人優待，東省高懸僞滿招牌，而又謂對於我國復興，甚為關切，噫是何言歟。</p>
<p>但是芳澤先生，究屬天良未泯，尙謂吾人事後追思，深知對付中國之行動，不無失當之處，則先生亦旣自知而自覺之矣，何以又說兩國各欲恢復正當感情，最好由中國改變其態度，而與日本合作，此語正是適得其反，假定兩國如欲恢復正當感情’應該日本先改變其態度，而與我國合作，方有恢復兩國正當感情之餘地，否則南轅北轍，將有不堪回首之日矣。</p>

<p>談運動與進補</p>
<p>强身之道，固須適宜運動以鍜鍊體魄，而允須調服滋補營養之劑，使血液盛旺，營養充分。蓋運動與滋補須雙方並重，互相表裏，未可偏廢也。</p>
<p>現代的補劑「人造自來血」補血强身，功效正確。「五洲乳白魚肝油」「地球脾麥精魚肝油」療虛健體，增加營養，號稱補品三傑，洵健康之要素，强身之捷經！</p>
<p>談婦女痛苦</p>
<p>婦女月信，一月一至，如點滴不休，或一月數至，殊感痛苦。反之若經閉澀少，鬱悶煩燥，則更危險！蓋太過與不及，均病態也。</p>
<p>五洲藥房有兩種妙劑，（一）月月紅，能通經活血。（一）女界寶，能滋補調經。均係婦科聖藥，功效正確，服之能澈底解除經病之痛苦。</p>
<p>談性病</p>
<p>身染淋濁性病，痛苦纏綿，後悔莫及。但旣經傳染，應速求合理治療，勿惑於江湖醫生之欺騙，及滑頭藥品之誇張宜傳，否則一誤再誤，悔之晚矣！</p>
<p>「的立平」為近代最完善之治淋專藥，效騐確實，毫無流弊，服後於利尿鎭痛，殺菌消炎，收歛淸濁諸功效，均能次第實現，而達全愈乃最合理想之療淋妙劑也。</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>好久想寫一篇花的文章，但是幾次提起筆來沒有寫得一個字。因為愛花成癖，在故鄕的院子里曾有數十盆我手植的花，在我離開故鄕之後都凋零了。當想寫一篇花的文章的時候，我馬上會記起那數十盆花朶死亡的難堪，終於擱了筆。</p>
<p>到上海來後，自然沒有種花的機會，而且環境也不允許你。退而求其次。想買幾技花來在案頭供奉，似乎也不很可能；那些鮮花舖子里雖然每天陳設着各種應時花朶，售價却實在太貴了。我幾乎像一個流浪人站立在麵包舖子玻璃窗外一樣，每天要到附折的一家花舖子門外去站立一會，那些花實在太可愛了</p>
<p>店主人是一個西洋女子，所以她的顧客也以西洋人為多數。星期六的下午及星期日的早上，購花的特別多，但是那些都不是愛花的人，他們是以花朶去和女友的愛情賭博的。所以售價太貴。那也是原因之一了。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>在南京路上有許多專賣白蘭花的小姑娘，老太婆自然也有。她們的主顧却以女客為對象了。她們喜歡站在百貨公司或綢緞舖的外面，見了購貨出來的女客，總是緊緊不捨地追隨着，希求脫手一支花，或者一個花球，但是那些小姑娘往往失望的，因為那些太太小姐們有「包月頭」的賣花人，按日早上送到她們府上去的。如果在黃昏時候，那末才是女客買花的時候，因為黃昏時走過那邊的女客，據說以上遊戲塲的為最多數；至於上遊戲塲為什麽一定要買一支花或一個花球綴在衣襟上，那是花的副作用了，未便多說。</p>
<p>這樣說來，那些小姑娘一天生意只做一個黃昏嗎？也决不是的，自有一些人化幾枚銅元和她們兜搭幾句油話，或者竟是擰一把手臂，抓一下手心，把買來的花一轉眼丟在馬路上了。那簡直是暴殄天物，然而也是花的副作用的一種</p>
<p>曾經和一個朋友在天色未明時上南陽橋去參觀花市。在鐵柵門的外面，直通到新開闢的和平路那邊去的行人道上及街心都是來趕市的賣花人。花市是以萬花樓茶館為中心，大家泡了一壺茶，在那裏等侯主顧，那些賣白蘭花的小姑娘這時候就在那裏穿來穿去，批了花來用鉛絲綴着。至於在賣買的時候，兜搭油話，和東掏西摸是更甚於南京路上的情形的。老太婆撅起了嘴嚕咕着批不到好花，生意要打折扣，但是那種下劣的侮辱是可以免除的。要是她也從小做賣花姑娘的，那她要悲哀自己的年齡跑得太快了；在批花的時候批不到好花，賣花的時候沒有人來和她搭腔，這正是象徵着花的命運呵！今天綴着衣襟上的，挿在膽瓶裏的，明天都已丟進了垃圾桶。</p>
<p>那天我眞高興極了。買了一束我最喜歡的大麗花。因為大麗花是我一位女友的名字，可惜我在愛情賭博上是失敗的，那一支鮮艷的大麗花現在不知挿在誰家的膽瓶裏？希望她永遠奪目可愛，不要像故鄕那數十盆花朶一樣凋落了。</p>
<p>現在我書桌上的耀裏挿着一支絹花，是百貨公司裏買來的，那花自然是大麗花了。雖然日子太久，花瓣上已滿貯了灰塵，紅色將變成暗黃色了。不過　為愛好的缘故，卽使由暗黃變成赭色，她終究是一支可愛的大麗花；而且我又買起高價的花朵，如果把她遺棄了，那個空着的膽瓶也將要失其效用了。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「啼笑因緣鞭撻鳳喜」</p>
<p>將軍怒目瞠圓睜。手執籐鞭樓上行。不防我。昨宵因事天津去。你竟是，背地偸身走出門。咳你這下賤人。抽一報。駡一聲。手揮目送不留停。但見他，雪膚雲鬢亂。衣衫不整露胸襟。鳳喜聽。戰競競。滿身香汗直淋淋。隔牆有耳終防覺。窗外豈無竊聽人。誰料是，盛怒將軍聞此語。頓然冷笑二三聲。你心中之事都明白。莫非是，密的佳期續舊情。我想你，蓬巷蝸居身下賤。淸歌檀板作營生。如今不改尋常熊。只恐怕，狐尾還防活現形。只道你，改絃易轍書生扮。艇作堂堂女學生。到此地，坐享榮華多富貴。錦衣玉食好歡心。誰知你，一身媚骨天成性。瞞不過，露水姻綠一段情。你竟然，暗中送我綠頭巾。蓬蒿不是淸高品。只當得，路柳牆花野草生。燕雀焉能產鳳子。當然沒福做夫人。</p>

<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>開篇「閨恨」（咪咪集創刋號）</p>
<p>秋景凋零已立冬。烏鴉羣羣喚寒風。硃砂雖吐陽光渠。月色微微夜霧濃。佳人獨坐呆思想。對孤燈不覺淚沾胸。不幸榷萱相繼卒。伶仃孤苦少弟兄。飄流無主他鄕寄。苦度光陰已幾冬。却被舅娘把姻親許。</p>

<p>說什麽風流公子宦門風。自從那年完花燭。誰知那大婦意氣不相同。他是無智無識無情輩。怎能够琴瑟唱和樂心胸。從無半句知心語。夫婦宛似陌路逢。恨他是花街柳巷常去宿。恨他是怪習與衆却不同。可恨月老無鑒察。錯牽紅絲恨無窮。我是方信古人言一句。紅顏薄命古今同。幾回思想悶心胸。終身冷落在深閨中。可憐奴是舊習千金女。怎能學得文明女子同。消遣無非琴一曲。玉笛難吹愁萬重。磋度華年鴛獨宿。半床錦被半床空。略覺神疲方入夢。却被那簷前寒鵲喚西風。我是凄凉無限訴蒼穹。</p>

<p>在戲台上——</p>
<p>觀衆為你的色藝傾倒，崇拜，瘋狂！</p>
<p>可是又有誰知你的實生活是那麽的凄凉？</p>
<p>你旣不能拒絕權門的侑酒飛觴，</p>
<p>無賴的丈夫又時時對你拳足加降，</p>
<p>因為你不能滿足他榨取的慾望！</p>
<p>而家庭間的負担又加在你的肩上，</p>

<p>也無力反抗，</p>
<p>因為封建的勢力正澎湃的高漲，</p>
<p>你這懦弱的女性呵；</p>
<p>一生就在這封建桎梏下埋葬！</p>
<p>含着苦痛的眼淚，</p>

<p>長途辛苦的跋涉，</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang has been discussing peaceful resolution methods with Wang Chonghui in recent days, with troop withdrawal from Guangxi as a prerequisite. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Several tens of thousands of troops under Gui Wang Zanbin, Tan Lianfang, and others have gathered to enter Hunan through Anhuang, Shahu, and Tuhua to seize Hengyang. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops are searching for salt and rice and forcibly conscripting laborers for transportation in the southern region, deploying defenses, and intending to station there for an extended period. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou's telegram to Li Bai on the 28th, the original text is as follows: (Omitted above) "I received your telegram, and I am deeply impressed. Your desire for peace is overflowing in your words, showing that the hearts of the people are not dead, which is so gratifying. However, the matters you mentioned are not based on facts. Navigation between Guangzhou and Wuzhou is as usual. Even the Hong Kong-Wuzhou ships have not stopped. Moreover, Yulin and Bobai in your area are rice-producing regions and also salt storage areas. There are no soldiers stationed in the southern region, so traffic can flow freely without obstruction. Why deny the facts and strongly claim it as an economic blockade, and then use this as an excuse to send troops to the southern region? As a guardian of the territory, what would I say to the frightened and uneasy people if the situation were reversed? Your brothers' love for peace should be manifested in facts. Do not give the nation a reason to criticize you. I urge you to quickly order Weng's troops to withdraw within a specified time, and then peace will soon be restored. After that, there will be a way to peace. I have conveyed everything to Chairman Huang Musong as you requested, and I have also noted your instructions." Humble greetings from your younger brother, Yu Hanmou. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Japan and the Soviet Union's Aerial Propaganda War <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The arms race between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East is now at a point of close quarters, not only in terms of naval, land, and air forces, but also in terms of propaganda, where mutual conflict has reached a critical stage. Recently, Japan built a 150-kilowatt broadcasting station in Nagasaki, preparing to use powerful broadcasting power to overwhelm the Soviet Union's Boli broadcasting station. This is clear evidence, because Japan and the Soviet Union have different state systems, and the propositions and ideals of the ruling class conflict with each other. When there is a war between the two countries, the propaganda duel will be more intense than the military and economic duels. Radio broadcasting is the most effective and convenient way to promote the propaganda.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Japanese Tongmeng News Agency, the Boli radio station violated international radio conventions and stole the wavelength of the Tokyo radio station in Japan. Because the power of the Boli radio station is greater than that of Tokyo, the programs broadcast by Tokyo are disturbed and cannot reach the outside world. Of course, this is Japan's side of the story and also an excuse for Japan to build a large radio station in Nagasaki. However, the aerial propaganda war in the Far East has already begun. The propaganda aggression of the Soviet Union and Japan has mutually invaded their respective borders. The propaganda war will cause bad feelings. Therefore, it is very obvious and possible that the military actions will be motivated.</p>
<p>During the last World War, Germany suffered a great blow in spirit and psychology because the organization of propaganda was not strict and the tools and techniques were not as good as those of Britain and France. As a result, it suffered military defeat. General Ludendorff said that Germany's failure was entirely due to the victory of British and French propaganda. In recent years, countries have competed to use radio broadcasting as a tool for foreign propaganda aggression. The revolution in Austria was caused by the radio broadcasts of the German National Socialist Party in Munich. The large radio station in Moscow regularly broadcasts speeches in English, French, Spanish, and other languages ​​inciting the proletarian revolution in various countries. Because the "ether" is full of the air and is not restricted by national borders, the war of propaganda can be provoked at any time and retaliation can be carried out at any time. There have been such battles between the Soviet Union and Germany, between the Soviet Union and Poland, and between Germany and Poland. The recent civil strife in Spain has also revealed that this propaganda tool occupies an important position in the war.</p>
<p>The aerial propaganda war in the Far East has already begun. The aerial order in the Far East has been disrupted by the mutual broadcasting of the same wavelength between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Boli radio station is 100 kilowatts, and the future Nagasaki radio station is 150 kilowatts, while the Nanjing radio station is only 75 kilowatts. Nagasaki can overwhelm Boli, and Boli can also overwhelm Nanjing. If we do not build a large radio station as soon as possible, once there is a war in the Far East, our radios will be full of either communist propaganda or Japanese aggressive broadcasts. It is dangerous and terrifying to have the air rights controlled by others.</p>

<p>(Chengdu) The bodies of Watanabe Kozo and Fukagawa Keiji were cremated at the Wenshu Temple in the North Gate on the 30th after being inspected by Matsumura, Kasuya, and others.

<p>(Chengdu) At 10:30 on the morning of the 30th, Tachihana Nobukazu, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, and Nakamura Masachika, a special correspondent for the Tokyo Osaka Asahi Shimbun, went to the Provincial Government to meet with Secretary-General Deng Hanxiang, with Secretary Li Youxi translating. The questions and answers are recorded as follows: First, Tachihana asked, "Both China and Japan should consider the Chengdu incident as unfortunate. I wonder what the Secretary-General's feelings are on this?" Deng replied, "The Provincial Government ordered the Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureau to send military and police to protect Tanaka Takeo and his party of four upon their arrival in Chengdu. The incident occurred on the evening of the 24th, and heavy troops were added. Many military and police were injured and killed. As a result of the rescue, only two people were rescued. The other two were scattered and disappeared in the chaos. It was not until the morning of the 25th that we learned that they had been killed. We failed to fully protect them to a safe area. I not only think this is unfortunate, but I also deeply regret it." Nakamura asked, "Why were there no large numbers of military and police protecting them when the incident occurred?" Deng replied, "There were only four Japanese merchants and reporters. The Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureau originally sent more than ten people to protect them in the store. This was usually sufficient. When the incident occurred, the thugs cut off the telephone lines. The security authorities rushed to the scene with large numbers of military and police after hearing the news. It was already in a state of chaos when they arrived, but they still tried their best to suppress the riots, resulting in many deaths and injuries on both sides. This is the fact at the time. If a large number of military and police had not arrived, Tanaka Takeo and Seto would have been able to escape. In short, if there were no reactionary elements and communist bandits taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble, this tragedy would not have happened." Nakamura asked again, "According to the Secretary-General, are the masses all pure, and are there any students among them?" Deng replied, "There are many people in the masses, and their knowledge is uneven. Since reactionary elements are mixed in, naturally there are also impure elements. As for whether there are students among them, it is impossible to distinguish at night." Nakamura asked, "What does the Secretary-General think should be done to resolve this matter?" Deng replied, "This is a local incident, so of course I hope that the local authorities will resolve it as soon as possible." Nakamura asked, "What is the Secretary-General's opinion on the establishment of a consulate in Chengdu?" Deng replied, "This matter should be handled in accordance with the orders of the Central Government." At this point, Tachihana, Nakamura, and others exchanged a few words and then took their leave.

<p>(Chengdu) Most of the newspapers in Rong City commented on the Rong case on the 30th. The Huaxi Daily said, "This is a case of being in the right place at the right time. Tanaka and others came to Rong just as the Communist bandits were miserably defeated and left Sichuan. Unscrupulous elements took advantage of the chaos to create a serious situation to increase the government's diplomatic difficulties. The government has done its best to comfort and treat the injured, and has investigated and dealt with the murderers. The emergency measures can be said to be sincere and thorough. Friendly countries will surely understand the fairness and speed of our government's handling. Now we will end this matter in a spirit of harmony to preserve the overall situation." The Xin Xin News wrote an article to Japanese colleagues who arrived in Rong, saying that Chinese journalists have never used common regretful incidents against our friendly countries to stimulate national sentiment to achieve political goals, and cited the cases of Wang Xitian and Ye Muhua being killed in Japan as examples, because they did not want to expand local incidents and become angry at a country and its people, thereby hindering the precious friendship between the two countries. The three colleagues came to Rong to investigate the truth with a fair attitude and fulfill their duties of reporting, and they will surely wipe out the recent unrealistic records in Japanese newspapers.

<p>(Guangzhou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened military officers in Guangdong Province at Whampoa Military Academy for a memorial week and delivered an address, the main points of which are as follows: (1) This time, all officers and soldiers of the four Route Armies worked together with one heart to set things right, restore the revolutionary base, and achieve peaceful unification. This is the most glorious and significant achievement in revolutionary history. However, we cannot be satisfied with the restoration of the revolutionary base; we must further restore the revolutionary spirit and realize the Three Principles of the People. Only then can we promote the existing glory and success. (2) All revolutionary armies are national armies. All revolutionary soldiers only know the entire nation and the entire people. The success or failure, gain or loss, honor or disgrace, life or death of everyone is for the whole, for the people. The lives of all revolutionary soldiers and the responsibility for national salvation and rejuvenation that they bear are for the whole. Therefore, all revolutionary soldiers must unite sincerely and not allow the slightest distinction or estrangement. (3) I am the commander-in-chief of the national army. My greatest responsibility is to teach all soldiers in the country the principles of being a modern soldier, so that all soldiers can become true modern soldiers, thereby creating a truly modern army with principles, discipline, and spirit, and establishing a modern society and country based on the Three Principles of the People. My main task in coming to Guangdong this time is also for this purpose. (4) The essence of modern military education lies in enabling soldiers to possess modern national morality and knowledge, as well as the noble character of modern citizens, in addition to military knowledge and skills, so that they can serve as role models for the general public. (5) To cultivate the model character of modern citizens and create true modern soldiers, our senior generals must first thoroughly eradicate all thoughts, actions, living habits of arrogance, luxury, indulgence, and idleness. We must vigorously practice "Party member's code of conduct" and "military discipline," lead by example, educate all subordinates, and influence the general public. Only then can we transform social customs, uplift people's spirits, build the country, and complete the revolution. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

French Minister of National Defense Daladier, Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin, Polish Ambassador to France Lukaszewicz, and many other military and political figures from both France and Poland were at the station to welcome him. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: General Ryz-Smigly, Inspector General of the Army, set out for France yesterday with his entourage. He passed through Vienna today without stopping and continued westward at 2:30 pm. According to reports, Ryz-Smigly's mission is military in nature and limited to the mutual relations between France and Poland, which is exactly the same as the purpose of French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin's visit to Warsaw some time ago. It is not true that Ryz-Smigly's trip to France was temporarily brought forward, as it was decided long ago that he would arrive in Paris before the French Army's autumn exercises. As for the claim that Ryz-Smigly's trip will bring about a major change in Polish foreign policy, it cannot be easily believed, because Polish policy is originally immutable. Any initiative taken internationally is based on the Franco-Polish alliance treaty of 1921 and there is no need for a change of course. The Warsaw "Daily Express" also recently stated that the Franco-Polish alliance treaty is of a permanent nature and has not changed in the slightest from the past. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish public is very interested in the visit to France by General Ryz-Smigly, Inspector General of the Army. Political circles also believe that the nature of the visit is more than just an international courtesy, and that in the current international situation, where crises are lurking everywhere, if the alliance between France and Poland can be further consolidated, it is what Austria and Switzerland should do. This is similar to the visit of French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin to Poland, which deserves special attention. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) General Ryz-Smigly, Inspector General of the Polish Army, is scheduled to arrive here today. Newspaper editorials have considered Ryz-Smigly's visit to be of great importance. "Le Matin" stated, "The relationship between the French and Polish peoples is very deep and has always been linked. Although it has undergone various political changes, it is permanently inseparable. The two countries are now working together, which is the best guarantee for peace." "Le Journal" stated, "Since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty, the Franco-Polish alliance treaty should be reorganized. The above-mentioned issue is the main topic discussed by General Ryz-Smigly and Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin. But in addition to this, Ryz-Smigly will also hold talks with various French cabinet members on various economic and political issues related to the two countries." Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez wrote an article in "L'Humanité" entitled "Long Live Poland," which stated, "We pay tribute to General Ryz-Smigly this morning in the name of the French passionate nation and the Communist Party, and we join with those who aspire to end the war in shouting 'Long Live Poland'."

<p>Bucharest, Romania – The new Tatarescu cabinet was formed last night. This morning at 1:00 AM, all cabinet members entered the palace to meet with King Carol and took the oath of office in the palace. Afterwards, Prime Minister Tatarescu addressed the press, outlining the new cabinet's policy guidelines. He stated that the new cabinet's policies would continue the established practices of the previous cabinet, with the aim of maintaining peace both domestically and internationally. The immediate priority is to ensure domestic stability, so that the public can share the benefits of prosperity.

<p>Disagreement with the Prime Minister's Political Views: The Reason for the Former Foreign Minister's Resignation</p>
<p>What surprises political figures here the most is the absence of former Foreign Minister Titulescu from the new cabinet list. Since 1922, Titulescu has held key positions as Foreign Minister for fifteen years without interruption. The foreign policy pursued by Romania was formulated by him, and he implicitly held sway over the political arena in domestic affairs as well. This cabinet reshuffle, with Mr. Titulescu unexpectedly missing out, was truly beyond initial expectations. Political figures are discussing this matter, with differing opinions. Some say that during the Montreal Conference in June of this year, Titulescu, representing his country, attended the meeting. During the negotiations, he suddenly heard that nationalist factions in the country were very active, so he rushed back to his country from Montreal to strongly advocate to Prime Minister Tatarescu the harm of nationalist factions, threatening to resign. Although it did not cause a political crisis at the time, Tatarescu could not help but feel uneasy, thinking that Titulescu's move was detrimental to the authority of the government. This may be one of the reasons for Titulescu's dismissal. Tatarescu, after obtaining the consent of Liberal Party leader Bratianu, sent a telegram to Titulescu, expressing gratitude for his contributions to the country over the past fifteen years and his previous enthusiasm for cooperation, but stating that, due to circumstances, he had to form a unanimous government in order to faithfully implement the Liberal Party's policies. Titulescu himself is currently vacationing in Eaux, France. After hearing the news of the cabinet reshuffle, he immediately stated that he would not criticize this move for the time being and that he would reserve his right to take any political action in the future.

<h3 id="e59">Holding a Gun in One Hand and a Hoe in the Other: Japan's Immigration Plan for the Northeast; 1 Million Households, 5 Million People to Be Moved in the Next 20 Years; Cultivating Fertile Land Drives the Northeast's Farmers to the Brink of Ruin <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from the China United News Agency – To solve the domestic difficulties of "overpopulation and insufficient land," Japanese imperialism has, since the September 18th Incident, intensified its exploitation of the people of the Northeast through political and economic means, and has actively implemented a policy of collective agricultural immigration, hoping to adjust the rural population issue and realize a rural regeneration plan. However, under the fierce impact of this policy, the farmers of Northeast China can only rely on the barren land left over after exploitation to live in hunger and cold. According to investigations, the total number of Japanese residents in Manchuria since the September 18th Incident has been less than one million, and most of them are related to employees of the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Kwantung Leased Territory. There are actually no genuine agricultural immigrants. After the September 18th Incident, the puppet government, following the wishes of the Japanese, made all facilities suitable for the needs of the Japanese, and at the same time, due to the increase in the military strength of the Kwantung Army and the number of Japanese officials, the number of Japanese people suddenly increased by 70,000 in less than two months, and their residential area has spread to various inland rural villages in Manchuria. At the same time, the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs took advantage of various preferential conditions obtained through armed aggression and began implementing a collective agricultural immigration policy in October of the 21st year. The Japanese who were relocated into the customs at that time were all demobilized soldiers from various counties in the domestic Northeast who were experienced in farming and animal husbandry, totaling 500 people. The relocation site was Jiamusi, downstream of the Songhua River. In February of the 22nd year, they were sent to Yongping Town, where they were divided into twelve tribes, each operating farming and animal husbandry. The Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Kwantung Army authorities, in order to strengthen their production capacity, also declared the town to implement an autonomous village system, and recruited families to immigrate together, so that they could permanently settle in the area. The area they are now cultivating totals 160 Japanese mu for soybeans, 120 Japanese mu for wheat, 80 Japanese mu for millet, and 60 Japanese mu for rice. In terms of animal husbandry, there are more than 700 heads of horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc. Other side businesses, such as manufacturing wheat flour, soybean oil, and soy sauce, are also quite developed. In July of the 22nd year, the second immigration was implemented, also with 500 people, relocated to Qihuli (Hunan Camp) adjacent to Yongfeng Town. This group of immigrants mainly engaged in agriculture, cultivating soybeans on 170 Japanese mu, wheat on 150 Japanese mu, and sorghum on 55 Japanese mu, in addition to 31 Japanese mu of paddy fields, with excellent harvests. The third immigration site was in Suiling (Wangrongmiao), also with 500 people, cultivating an area of 14,000 Japanese mu, mainly planting wheat and soybeans. In terms of animal husbandry, sheep production was also quite prosperous. The above three were all so-called trial immigrations, and because they were under the assistance of armed forces, the results gave the Japanese authorities satisfactory answers. Therefore, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs again gathered more than 400 people last summer, gave them strict training, and crossed the border in September to engage in pioneering activities in various counties of Heilongjiang. This is the situation of the fourth immigration. Recently, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Army Ministry, and the Kwantung Army authorities, in view of the excellent results of several past immigrations, have decided to allocate more than 600 million yen to implement a large-scale 20-year immigration plan to Manchuria (from 1937 to 1957), relocating 1 million households, totaling 5 million people, and have set the coming year to begin moving in 10,000 households, totaling 50,000 people. The relocation sites are as follows: (1) Northern Manchuria: 500,000 households (2.5 million people); (2) Suburbs of Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jinzhou: Undetermined number of immigrants; Rehe and Inner Mongolia areas: Undetermined number of pastoral immigrants; (3) Forest areas of Jilin Province: Undetermined number of forestry immigrants; Gold mining immigrants near Mohe in Heilongjiang: Undetermined number of immigrants. Under such severe destruction, most of the farmers in the Northeast have already armed themselves and organized or participated in volunteer armies to defend their own farmland. They attacked Qihuli, the reclaimed land of the second collective agricultural immigration by Japan, last spring, causing them heavy losses. After learning this lesson, they have deeply recognized the strength of the volunteer army's fighting power, so in addition to hoes, each person carries a rifle to guard against attacks by the volunteer army, and also performs the task of reconnaissance for the Kwantung Army.</p>

<p>Wang Qimei – During yesterday's discussion of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Pacific Conference, French representative and former Prime Minister Sarraut advocated for the creation of a new treaty, with enforcement clauses included to deal with countries violating the agreement. Japanese representative Kengo Adachi rebuked this proposal at yesterday's conference. He stated: "If the new treaty is based on enforcement clauses, then the League of Nations already faced various difficulties when implementing sanctions against Italy. Lessons of the past are not far away, and you must pay attention to them. As for Japan, I believe my government will feel uneasy about this issue of enforcement." British representative and former naval minister Alexander stated that lasting peace could not be achieved until the relevant countries adopted appropriate measures to maintain collective security. Next, Soviet representative Motilev spoke: "As far as Russia is concerned, if it were not for the Soviet Union of today but for the imperialist Russia before the revolution, the world situation would be beyond imagination. It is important to know that the Soviet Union has now completely eliminated the idea of ​​external development or aggression against other countries and has become the pillar of world peace. Is this change not obvious to everyone?" At this point, French representative Sarraut declared: "In Yusmei Park, all acts of harming living things have been banned. If this ban can be extended and applied to international life as well, would it not be a good thing? As for the claim that it is difficult for Eastern and Western countries to reach a compromise, I have never dared to believe it." (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>Madrid – The government has issued a bulletin on the war situation in various regions, stating, "The front line in the Estremadura region of the southwest is experiencing extremely fierce battles. The rebel army has concentrated its elite forces there, all equipped with the latest weapons, and with many aircraft. However, the militias are resisting strongly, and the rebel army has not yet succeeded. The front lines in the Andalusia region in the south and the Asturias province in the northwest are also experiencing intense battles, and it is difficult to determine who will win. There were no battles on other lines today." In addition, the government issued a broadcast message stating that while rebel aircraft frequently bombard the capital, it is difficult to have a significant impact. The rebel army is well aware of this, and its repeated attacks are intended to shake morale and prevent people from continuing to resist. Therefore, the government is using "resist to achieve victory" as its slogan. (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Burgos – According to news from Guipúzcoa province, several revolutionary army units have occupied the village of Bergoin, west of the city of Irún, and captured two cannons, two machine guns, and countless ammunition.

<p>Hendaye, Southern France – The Spanish revolutionary army again launched a fierce attack on Irún last night but was unsuccessful. It has stopped attacking this morning, seemingly waiting for reinforcements, and plans to capture the city via Fontarabie, four kilometers from Irún. Government troops inside Irún are extremely busy with troop movements. At 5:00 PM today, many trucks loaded with soldiers drove to the front line. An officer told our reporter that everything is fine on the front line, and the situation has not changed. San Sebastián was also completely calm today. (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, Southern France – Aircraft of the Spanish revolutionary army in the north flew to bombard the forts of Santa Engracia and Guadalupe near Irún this morning. However, because the aircraft dropped bombs from an altitude of 1,200 meters, the forts did not suffer significant damage. Government aircraft flew to Pamplona, the capital of Navarre province, one of the revolutionary army's bases, yesterday and carried out heavy bombing. According to the Spanish "Popular Front" newspaper, revolutionary army aircraft bombed a government military factory in Éibar (30 kilometers from Tolosa) in Guipúzcoa province yesterday, resulting in many casualties. (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from Spain received here, the Nationalist army's attacks on Irún and San Sebastián in the past week have not achieved their goals. The Nationalist army seems to have miscalculated the strength of the government side in these two cities. Government troops have only had crude and outdated weapons in the past four weeks, but they have now been replaced with the latest weapons. The Nationalist army's slow advance is also of great benefit to the enemy, as it allows the enemy to build trenches and prepare supplies. Thousands of miners have been sent by the Basque army to reinforce, so their strength is becoming more formidable. The French border near these two locations makes it very convenient for France to provide assistance, which also increases the strength of the Red Army. Military observers say that the only chance for the Nationalist army to break through Irún is to launch a full-scale attack on the city, regardless of the lives and property of civilians. Therefore, it is widely believed that there will be an unprecedented fierce battle on this front line next week, and its outcome may affect this civil war. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>

<p>Madrid – The government has issued a statement that 1,200 rebel troops in the Alcázar Palace in Toledo, south of the capital, have been besieged by government troops for many days. Government aircraft have completely destroyed the front wall of the palace. The civil governor of the city, Mr. Vanga, told our reporter that the rebel troops trapped in the Alcázar Palace have run out of food. Although many aircraft have tried to deliver food to support the rebel troops inside the palace, they have been monitored by government anti-aircraft artillery and have had to fly too high to drop supplies. Government troops have laid 300 kilograms of landmines around the palace walls. Under the current circumstances, it would be possible to take it down in a few hours, but in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, they are still waiting for the rebel troops to surrender voluntarily. However, to warn the rebel troops, several of the landmines have been detonated, and a loudspeaker has been used to inform the rebel troops that if they continue to resist stubbornly, the entire Alcázar Palace will be destroyed, and everyone will perish. Since issuing this warning, many rebel troops in the palace have been surrendering in groups every day. (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>Burgos – The "Nationalist Government" here issued an order today that the Spanish national flag should immediately be restored to the style of the monarchy era (i.e., the red, yellow, and red tricolor flag). Regarding the war situation on the front lines, it is reported that several columns of the revolutionary army have advanced towards the province of Guadalajara north of the capital, and Sivilcha is under siege and may fall at any moment. In addition, the revolutionary army's northern and southern routes have established contact, and the railway running north and south across the country is now operating normally. Many people from the Autonomous Province of Catalonia came here today to join the army, intending to form another team to assist in the war. These people had originally expressed sympathy for the revolutionary army since the start of the war, but due to poor conditions, they hid in the mountains, waiting for the opportune moment.

Important figures are arrested, tried, and convicted, while ordinary people are mostly executed without trial.

Those who are weak and powerless are unable to protect themselves in this situation. The rebel army now views the French as communist revolutionaries, while those who support the government suspect that France has secretly aided the rebel army with arms and ammunition.

Gwilym Griffiths, a Labour MP and former secretary of the South Wales Miners' Federation, also said that the current government will ask various trade union organizations to assist in the rearmament plan.

<p>If the goal is to provide abundant and inexpensive electricity, then no one would say that the current situation can be left unattended. Regarding future economic concepts, they cannot proceed according to liberalism, and only by implementing a certain degree of controlled economy. Standing on this fundamental concept, it is natural to manage public utilities such as electricity under state control. However, the question is how to do it. Which is better, the Ministry of Communications' proposal for private ownership and national operation or the proposal for private ownership and private operation? This is the subject of research. Recently, there have been opinions within the party advocating national ownership and national operation as a better option, but from the standpoint of public debt policy, I find it difficult to absolutely agree with national ownership and national operation.

<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Although the Central Government has sent senior officials to Guangxi to mediate the Guangxi affair, the mediation over the past half month has ultimately been ineffective due to Li and Bai's strong attitude. At present, the Guangxi army has taken action to break through and invade Guangdong. Since Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, and Leizhou, which border Guangxi and Guangdong, are located near the sea and adjacent to the French Guangzhou Bay, in order to open up sea routes for transportation, it is inevitable to invade the southern part of Guangdong Province as a base for the Guangxi situation. Therefore, the important agencies in Nanning had already been relocated to Wuming in advance, using the natural barriers of mountains and rivers as a base. At the same time, plainclothes troops were sent to invade the four prefectures of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, and Leizhou in Guangdong. These plainclothes troops of the Guangxi army had already dispersed into the Guangdong border before the 21st of this month. Therefore, on the 22nd, the agencies in Lianzhou and Beihai were disturbed once by the invading vanguard of the Guangxi army. The Hepu County Government and the Beihai branch of the Provincial Bank have packed up and moved important documents and silver coins, as well as tax revenue. All telephone bureaus and radio bureaus have also moved their equipment. Municipal bureaus, public security bureaus, and other agencies have also prepared to leave the city with their files. Later, it was discovered that the vanguard of the Guangxi army had taken the road through Yulin, Bobai, Shahezai, and arrived at Shisun on the evening of the 21st. (Shisun is about 130 li from Lianzhou in Guangdong). At the same time, a part of the Guangxi army entered the Guangdong territory of Luwu through Nanxiang. As a result, the Qinzhou government office moved after hearing the news. On the 24th of this month, the official troops of the Guangxi army arrived one after another. It is said that the Guangxi army's Su Zuxin division, about 4,000 to 5,000 people, entered Guangdong's Gaozhou and Leizhou from Yulin and Bobai. The Guangxi army's Zhou Zuhuang division, about 7,000 to 8,000 people, entered the Liangyang area (Yangjiang and Yangchun counties) was the Weng Zhaoyuan division. Therefore, since the 25th, Guangxi troops have been found everywhere in Liangyang, Gaozhou, Leizhou, Qinzhou, and Kangzhou in Guangdong Province. All highways south of Liangyang have been closed, and telecommunications traffic has also been cut off. Most of the tax revenue in the southern part has been intercepted by the Guangxi army. After the 26th, long-distance buses on the main highways from Kaiping County's Changsha to Meicha, and from Hua County to Leizhou and Suixi, were requisitioned by the Guangxi army for transporting troops. The Guangxi army's Zhou Zuhuang and Weng Zhaoyuan units occupied Lianjiang City on the 25th, passed through Anpu on the 26th, and arrived at Suixi on the 27th. Government officials fled to Guangzhou Bay. On the 28th, officials from Huaxian and Xinyi also fled to Meichashi (under Gaozhou). The Southern District Pacification Commissioner's Office has sent an urgent telegram requesting assistance. (August 29th)</p>

In the Jieshi area of Lufeng, more than 20 salt fields collapsed, and dozens of ships sank. In Yuanfeng Township in the first district of Haifeng, and Dawai She in the third district, the paddy fields and houses were flooded by the tidal wave caused by the hurricane. The water in the inner streets was more than three feet high. The fourth district became a swamp, and most of the roads were destroyed. The seawater flooded to the foot of Nanshan Mountain, and the breached levee caused the salt fields to be submerged. More than 30 thatched houses in Zhelang Township were blown down, and more than 20 fishing boats went missing. Zhongshan County is also a coastal area. Fortunately, there is a huge harbor to buffer the force of the wind; otherwise, the losses from this typhoon would have been unimaginable. However, during this typhoon, civilian houses collapsed in Shiqi, and seawater flooded the streets to a depth of two feet. In Qianshan, the water was knee-deep. Telephone and street light poles and wires in the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of the county were completely broken. The water in the sand fields was more than ten feet high, and dozens of houses collapsed in the second district. The disaster in the seventh district was unprecedented. The typhoon started in this area at about 3:00 a.m. on the 16th. Nanshui port was at the forefront because of its proximity to the sea. More than 50 houses were blown down in the entire port, and refugees were trapped on isolated islands, cut off from food and drinking water. Of the more than 200 fishing boats in the nearby fishing villages, only about 30 remained after the windstorm, which was also very tragic. The next day, people from all walks of life in the county sent people to provide relief with dry food and fresh water, and those who had no home to return to were transported back to the county seat for resettlement. In Taishan County, the Haiyan district of the county suffered the worst damage from the typhoon on the evening of the 16th. Xiaoluo Township in this district is located near the sea and has a high embankment to protect it from the tides. The embankment was built in the Shengqing Qianlong era. Various surnames lived together in the embankment, with a population of about 5,000, mostly making a living by fishing and farming. All was peaceful. Unexpectedly, on the night of August 16, a hurricane struck, and the embankment collapsed, and seawater rushed in. Eight out of ten houses in the entire village collapsed, and more than a thousand people drowned. Livestock, food, and utensils were all washed away. More than 4,000 refugees cried on the embankment, homeless, starving and waiting for help. It was a disaster unprecedented in the village for more than 200 years. In addition, all the embankments in the Haiyan district were breached by the water. In recent days, more than 470 corpses have been found, more than 1,700 houses have collapsed, and more than 1,000 refugees have been displaced. Recently, the county party headquarters has telegraphed the provincial authorities about the disaster and requested the government to allocate funds for emergency relief as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e85">Internal Strife Among Remnant Bandits in Western Fujian, Bandit Leader Qiu Jinsheng Removed from Office, Many Bandits Surrender Themselves to the District Office <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The remnant bandits in western Fujian have the pseudo "Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee" as their highest authority, commanding the bandit forces in Yan, Yong, Ping, Lian, and Shang in western Fujian, as well as Jing, He, Pu, Yun, and Zhao counties in Zhangzhou in southern Fujian. Zhang Dingcheng serves as chairman, Deng Zihui as vice chairman, and Tan Zhenlin and others as members. Recently, due to conflicts of interest, internal strife has occurred. Qiu Jinsheng, the pseudo eighth regiment leader, commander of the third anti-Japanese war zone, and member of the Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee, was removed from his concurrent positions as commander of the third district and member of the military and political committee by the pseudo Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee. At the same time, Chen Chaopan, the pseudo deputy chairman of the Yan South Zhang County Committee, was removed from all concurrent positions and expelled from the party for four months. The militia team in Yanxiang, Longyan County, recently searched bandit documents and found the newly published "Red Flag, Issue 4," which contained the process of Qiu's removal and the "Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee's" announcement of Qiu's crimes. It is said that Qiu is from Longyan and is the most powerful of the bandits. He gained the status of bandit leader in Yan and Yong. His eighth regiment is the main force of the bandits in western Fujian. He is usually arrogant and indulgent, and has conflicts with the chief of staff sent to the area by the pseudo Military and Political Committee. They are incompatible with each other, and he is also incompatible with the political commissar of the area. Many of the orders issued by the pseudo Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee are disobeyed, which has long been displeasing to Zhang Dingcheng. Therefore, this removal occurred. Although Qiu was forced to relinquish his concurrent positions as commander of the third district and member of the military and political committee, he still serves as the pseudo eighth regiment leader. After his removal, he was extremely indignant and tried to overthrow Zhang Dingcheng. Furthermore, there is also fierce infighting between Zhang Dingcheng and Deng Zihui. As for the reasons for Chen Chaopan's punishment, it is because he is at odds with Wei Jinshui, the chairman of the pseudo Yan South Zhang County Committee. This shows the intensity of the infighting among the bandits. The crimes of Qiu and Chen also show the depth of the corruption and deterioration of the bandits. Since the internal strife among the bandits, in the past week, many villagers in the fourth and sixth districts of Longyan who were forced to join the bandits have surrendered to the district office and the joint guarantee director with their guns. In Zhangzhou, since the 75th Division's Shi brigade suppressed the four counties of Jing, He, Ling, and Yi and recovered the Liangshan bandit den, after the news that bandit leader Zhang Changshui was shot and killed, the bandits along the Zhangzhou-Yian line on the Longyi Road have been eliminated. In the past week, the banditry in various counties in Zhangzhou has been relatively restrained. However, there are still bandit disturbances in Longyan and Zhangping in western Fujian.

<h3 id="e86">After Yang Yongtai Takes Office in Hubei: Political Measures in Hubei Province; Comprehensive Renovation of Administrative Organs at Provincial, District, and County Levels; Implementing "Six Transformations" to Save Rural Areas with a "Four-in-One" System; Completion of Highway Network Construction; Wuhan as a Garden City <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After enduring natural disasters and banditry, Hubei Province's key policies were progressing slowly. Only after Zhang Qun took office as Provincial Chairman were concrete plans made, but due to being summoned to the central government, he was unable to fully implement them. The central government, recognizing Hubei's crucial position, urgently sought to promote construction and specially appointed Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Military Affairs Commission Chairman's Office, concurrently as head of Hubei's administration. He assumed office on New Year's Day this year and has now served for eight months. Under Yang's management and planning, coupled with abundant agricultural harvests and financial stability, significant progress has been made in political measures. At the beginning of his tenure, Yang published his political views, outlining several key points, and has since been systematically advancing these goals. The most prominent is the improvement of administrative organs. All departments and offices have implemented joint office operations to unify government orders. All civil servants are managed according to military discipline, sweeping away the past habits of procrastination and inefficiency. The atmosphere has been completely transformed. After self-rectification, all administrative affairs have become well-organized. Regarding civil affairs, administrative inspector districts have been reorganized, with the original eleven districts reduced to eight. County government organizations have been improved, with revised personnel quotas and salaries, saving expenses. The implementation of district offices is being carried out in phases, with the first phase covering twenty-four counties including Wuchang, and the second phase covering twenty-four counties including Jiayu. The original one hundred and twenty-eight districts have been reduced to eighty-eight. Training of Baojia (neighborhood watch) and consolidation of public security are all based on the district offices as the backbone. The public security bureaus located in the district office residences are merged into the county government to complete the connection of security and seek coordination of police administration. In the Jianghan River basin area, river police have been added, and river Baojia are being compiled and investigated. In terms of opium suppression, 6,678 opium dens have been closed, and 124 drug rehabilitation hospitals and centers have been established. 20,062 opium addicts have been forcibly rehabilitated, and 41,900 opium addicts have been rehabilitated voluntarily. 120,000 kilograms of drugs have been burned, and 340,000 opium addicts have been registered. Opium seedlings have been eradicated throughout the province. Regarding financial affairs, independent county finances have been implemented, with the establishment of collection offices and county treasuries. The revenue and expenditure auditing system adopts a detached system, so that accounting and financial accounting are separate and independent, helping each other. Rent collectors have been abolished and replaced with tax collection supervisors to avoid extortion. Business tax bureaus have also been reorganized across the board. Business tax revenue has exceeded the quota. After the deed tax was reorganized, revenue increased by one times compared to the previous year. Regarding land tax and land administration, the two are inherently one. Except for the land survey reports, which have only been completed in six counties, and future assistance from the central government for aerial surveying is still needed, the reorganization of land tax has been effectively implemented. The methods are: unified collection, renovated institutions, strict performance assessment, rigorous auditing, and equalization of tax rates, revised tax amounts, stipulating that each mu of high-grade land will be taxed at 1.2 dimes, medium-grade land at 1 dime, and low-grade land at 8 cents. Overly heavy taxes will be based on the original amount, and the payment of coupon taxes will be waived. Land tax has increased by 1.13 million annually, which, together with the original tax amount of 3.34 million, totals 4.47 million, exceeding the highest tax amount of 4.16 million in the fifth year of the Republic of China. It has also been decided that this year will be the land tax year. Using the Baojia system, households will be asked about land, and land will be asked about grain. In the future, income can be doubled due to the land survey. As for the tax arrears of various counties, totaling 6 million yuan, they are also being thoroughly cleared. Regarding rural relief, Yang has proposed the slogan of "scientific, industrialized, organized, cooperative, militarized, and disciplined agriculture," also known as the "Six Transformations" policy. It is also the so-called "four-in-one system of management, education, raising, and sanitation." In order to organize agricultural products and facilitate freight transportation, the Agricultural Products Consolidation and Marketing Office and the Agricultural Products Consolidation and Marketing Design Committee have been specially established, one as the executive agency and one as the design agency. Other measures such as the establishment of cooperative treasuries, simple agricultural warehouses, handling of agricultural product mortgages, encouraging land reclamation and animal husbandry, promoting tung tree planting, and improving cotton seeds, ramie, and silkworm industries are all being actively carried out. Moreover, the Jianghan River basin often suffers from floods, and other counties are prone to drought. A water conservancy design committee has been formed to conduct research. In the upper reaches of the Xiang River, the construction of flood control dams and reservoirs has already begun. Water conservancy loans are also being offered, with the scope of loans including (1) repairing dikes, (2) building sluices, (3) repairing culverts, (4) dredging ditches, (5) dredging river ports, and (6) other drainage and irrigation equipment. The annual interest rate is only set at four percent. In the midst of passive prevention, it is an active move to seek benefits. Farmers in various counties have all expressed their convenience. Regarding construction, in addition to repairing dikes for flood prevention and dredging ponds for drought prevention, the completion of the highway network is also important. Among them, the Bazhi section is the most difficult. This section runs from Badong through Jianshi to Enshi, with a length of 208.0 kilometers, all high mountains and steep ridges. It is now open to traffic. The Chongtong section from Chongyang to Tongshan, the Tongxin section from Tongshan to Xintanpu, the Xinyang section from Xintanpu to Yangxin, and the Xinji section from Xintanpu to the boundary marker on the Jiangxi border are all built and opened to traffic this year. Together with the previous ones, a total of 3,600 kilometers of highways have been built. In addition, sections such as Shilai, Chongping, Yangjie, Yangqi, Xituan, and Tuanliu are under construction and will soon be completed. Sections such as Shili, Shizhu, Xiantong, and Yiwu are still in the planning stage. As for the construction of the provincial capital, there has been even more amazing development. Yang's goal is to realize the idea of a garden city, so that people from other provinces are happy to invest, so that it will gradually become prosperous. With the opening of the Yuehan Railway, agricultural products may be concentrated in Wuchang. Therefore, the construction of Wuchang is superficially to prosper the city, but in reality, it is still to relieve the countryside. Regarding education, education funding has been restored to the budget, and accumulated arrears over the years have been cleared. This year's budget is one-third higher than last year's. It has been determined that popularizing literacy education is the criterion for implementing national crisis education. More than half of the counties have established popular literacy education committees. Lianbao (joint guarantee) primary schools are being promoted by district offices and are also showing results. Other measures such as summer military training for teachers and staff, teacher certification, and the implementation of a full-time system, as well as the opening of township personnel training institutes, have either been implemented or are still in preparation. Before the summer military training for teachers and staff, many did not want to participate, but in the end, they all complied. They have now been training for many days and will soon be able to complete the task.</p>

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The transportation infrastructure in northern Anhui was originally underdeveloped. In past years, county roads between various counties were mostly bumpy, undulating, rugged, and uneven. Traveling by car on them often felt like a roller coaster ride. In recent years, the Provincial Department of Construction has been actively carrying out the construction of highways, and the administrative authorities of various counties have also been repairing the original roads in stages, striving to improve them. Compared with the county roads of the past, there has been great progress. The main roads along the Jinpu Railway and the Changhuai area have been largely completed. Those that have not been completed are still being actively extended. According to information obtained from the Highway Bureau, the section of highway from Bengbu to Guzhen has recently been repaired under the supervision of the Bengu Road Engineering Office. Four-tenths of the entire section has been completed, and the rest is being worked on to ensure completion on schedule. The roadbed from Bengbu to Zhengyang has been surveyed by engineer Ding Gongnan of the Bengu Road Engineering Office under orders. The entire line is about to be completed. As soon as the survey is completed, construction will begin. The section of highway from Mingguang to Shuanggou (under the jurisdiction of Si) has been started after a joint survey by the governments of Xuyi and Si counties. The section from Linhuai to Jiangba is being actively prepared and surveyed by the Linjiang Highway Engineering Office. The budget for the intermediate culvert project has been approved by the Provincial Highway Bureau and submitted to the Department of Construction for review. The entire project will not be completed until next year. (28th)</p>

<p>Ta Yan Buddhist Temple in Punan New Street was suddenly attacked by seven or eight robbers speaking a local dialect the day before yesterday (23rd). They knocked on the gate, tied up all the monks, and searched the temple for half an hour before escaping south. The abbot of the temple, Ren Zhao, checked the losses and found that more than twenty yuan in cash and clothing had been robbed. However, the abbot was afraid of making enemies with the bandits and did not dare to report it. Later, the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and sent police to investigate. They have asked the General Bureau to investigate and arrest the bandits.</p>

<p>Central Committee Member Wang Boling is purely filial. Since the death of his mother, he has been in great pain and has been chanting scriptures and eating vegetarian food without interruption. A funeral was held in the Western Hills last month. Wang built a hut by the tomb on the cemetery grounds. It is said that he is currently planning the design of the tomb himself and has entrusted monks from Gaomin Temple to purchase bluestone in the Suzhou area to build a memorial archway. He has also asked Committee Member Jiang Wei to personally inscribe the tombstone. Central Committee Member Liu Yazi and Supervisory Yuan Member Liu San separately wrote the tomb inscription and epitaph.</p>

<p>Guo Wei, the former president of the Jiangdu County Court, is one of the legal circles who studies academic matters. He has little interest in judicial administration. As a result, not long after taking office, he sought a way to get rid of it. Later, because most of the legal community advocated that he serve as a representative of the National Assembly in this session, Guo complied with the request of his colleagues and resigned from the position of president of the Jiangdu District Court and participated in the election. It was unexpected that Guo's acquisition of membership in the Bar Association was after the promulgation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law. Therefore, according to the law, he was not allowed to participate. It is truly Guo's misfortune.</p>

<p>According to New Sound News Agency, Chu Minyi, Deputy Director of the National Assembly Election General Office, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by train at around 7:00 AM yesterday. He told the New Sound News Agency reporter at his residence that the candidate lists in several provinces have already been submitted for the National Assembly election. The procedures are slightly slower in other provinces because citizens registered later. As long as various procedures are completed before October 10, there will be no problem. The General Office is now urging various provinces not to exceed the deadline, so that the conference can be held on schedule. As for the construction of the conference venue, the Fine Arts Exhibition Hall has been completed, and the National Academy of Drama and Music is being rushed. President Jiang cabled that the plaque of the National Academy of Drama and Music should be changed to the five characters "National Assembly Hall," which were written by Committee Member Jiang. It will be completed by the end of October. The report that it will be completed by the end of next month is misinformation. Chu also talked about the current situation of the Chairman of the Central Political Committee, Jingwei, saying that Jingwei's heart disease has improved, but his liver disease has not improved due to the hot weather, and neither has his diabetes. The sugar content in his blood is still above 200 per thousand. The doctor advised that the bullet in his back does not need to be removed. Even if it needs to be removed, his physical condition does not allow surgery. Therefore, there is no date for his return to China. It is expected that he will not be able to return until after four or five months, or even more than four or five months. Also, Tieci and Zeng Rongfu arrived in Shanghai by the same train yesterday morning.</p>

The plan is being planned by his friends in Shanghai. As for whether Yan's industries in Tianjin will be moved to Shanghai or whether a branch will be established in Shanghai, it will be decided after Yan arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Election General Office; Please Use Domestically Produced Paper for Ballots; Reimbursement Is Not Allowed for Those Who Have Purchased Imported Products <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Assembly Representative Election General Office in Nanjing yesterday, stating that since the promotion of domestic goods has been repeatedly ordered by the government in recent years, it is even more necessary for public officials to take the lead in practicing it in accordance with the meaning of leading by example. The election of representatives of the National Assembly this time is a major event related to the country, and the paper used for the ballots should be selected from suitable domestically produced paper in order to promote the national system and maintain rights. It is heard that some provinces have actually used imported newspapers to report on the purchase of ballot paper this time. The government's order to promote domestic goods cannot be realized in the provinces outside Beijing, which makes the general public hear and be bewildered. It is proposed that your office order the election offices in various places to use domestically produced paper for all ballots. Those who have purchased imported products should be ordered to discard them and not allow reimbursement. The ancients said that those who teach by example are followed, and those who teach by words are argued. If the wind blows, the grass will bend. It must start from here. I hope you will adopt this suggestion. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Chen Jie Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Various Diplomatic Issues; Hopes for a Reasonable Resolution to the Chengdu Incident; No Concrete Plan for Economic Cooperation Has Been Proposed <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Chen Jie, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai at 11 PM the day before yesterday via the 5 PM express train. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met him on the train and conducted the following interview: (Question) After the Chengdu incident, what measures has the government taken, and what is the guiding principle? (Answer) This incident occurred on the 24th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Wu Zexiang, the special envoy stationed in Sichuan, on the following day, reporting the Chengdu riot and casualties among the people, including Japanese residents. At that time, Minister Zhang was still in Guling and preparing to return to Nanjing. He immediately reported the matter by telephone. Zhang flew back to Nanjing on the 26th, convened a special meeting, and consulted with key government officials to discuss investigation and response methods. On one hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to inquire about the details of the riot and the situation of Japanese residents, urging them to strictly suppress the situation, intensify the pursuit of the perpetrators, and earnestly protect foreign nationals. On the other hand, the Executive Yuan telegraphed Liu, the Chairman of Sichuan Province, ordering him to promptly investigate and punish local military and police personnel who failed to provide adequate protection, and to immediately dispatch personnel from the Ministry to Sichuan to investigate the truth. That evening, Suma, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited Minister Zhang for other matters. Zhang immediately informed him of the situation he had heard and the government's handling of the matter, expressing deep regret and promising to do his best to seek a proper resolution based on a detailed report, with an open and sincere attitude, and fair and reasonable methods. He earnestly hoped that the Japanese side would also exercise patience and caution, and not allow a local incident to hinder the overall adjustment. The investigator's report on the case is expected to arrive in Nanjing shortly. The Japanese side has also dispatched Embassy Secretary Matsumura and Chongqing Consul Kasuya to investigate the matter, and it is expected that they will also provide a detailed report. This is the general process and guiding principle of the government's handling of this case. In short, the occurrence of this incident was truly unexpected by the government. The government has always paid great attention to the protection of foreign nationals. Based on the number of casualties among the Chengdu military and police and the situation described by Tanaka, who was rescued from the hospital by the Director of the Public Security Bureau, it can be seen that the situation at the time was critical and efforts were made to protect foreign nationals. Two principal offenders were executed by firing squad that same day. Today, the National Government reiterated the order to maintain friendly relations, which further demonstrates the government's clear attitude. (Question) Is there any concrete progress in Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? It is said that Wang Keyou will go north soon. Is this true? (Answer) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China has been discussed for a long time, but no concrete plan has yet been proposed. Wang is expected by both sides to realize this matter, and it is hoped that he can go north as soon as possible to take charge of the process. (Question) When will the newly appointed ambassadors to Russia and the United States take office? (Answer) The newly appointed ambassador to Russia, Jiang, has returned to Nanjing from Guling and is currently preparing for the handover and arranging departure procedures. It is said that he will depart in October. Ambassador to the United States, Wang, must wait until September 3, after leading the World Games delegation back from Italy, before scheduling his departure to the United States. (Question) There have been many changes in overseas embassies and consulates recently. Have you heard of any guiding principles for these changes? (Answer) Since Minister Zhang took office, the Ministry has focused on adjusting diplomatic relations externally and adjusting staff internally. After performance appraisals, the adjustment of Ministry staff is largely complete. However, the scope of overseas missions is larger and there are more staff members. Many of them have served abroad for a long time and are unfamiliar with the domestic situation. At the same time, some internal staff are not very familiar with the overseas situation. It is being considered to transfer staff internally and externally, selecting outstanding personnel from overseas missions for internal use, and assigning internal staff who are qualified and capable of being trained to overseas positions. The intention of talent development is incorporated into the adjustment. It is said that Chen's visit to Shanghai this time is to take care of personal matters and there are no other tasks.</p>

In order to arouse the members' interest in studying antiquities, the association also held an antiquities exhibition at the same time. People in Shanghai took advantage of the weekend holiday to visit the exhibition enthusiastically. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibition of Antiquities</p>
<p>The antiquities displayed by the association yesterday were generally divided into three categories: pottery, stone tools, and porcelain. (1) Those belonging to pottery include pottery pots, pottery statues, pottery jars, pottery urns, pottery fragments, epitaphs, and bricks. (2) Those belonging to stone tools include stone shovels, stone axes, stone spears, stone arrowheads, and stone balls. (3) Those belonging to porcelain are arranged according to the era, divided into Han porcelain, Six Dynasties porcelain, Tang porcelain, Northern Song porcelain, and Southern Song porcelain. In addition, the paper model of the Warring States period bronze plate and the Song Guan kiln temporarily sent to the meeting by antique collectors are particularly unique. These antiquities were mostly discovered in Gudang in Zhejiang Province, Qianshanyang in Huzhou, and Quanshan, Yan City, and Yue City in Jiangsu Province. Some also came from Shanxi and Xiamen. Wei Juxian explained them separately and gave enthusiastic instructions. The audience was very interested.</p>
<p>Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Cai Yuanpei delivered an opening speech, saying, "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Wu Yue History and Geography Research Association. The purpose of our association is based on the successive discoveries of ancient stone tools and pottery in Gudang, Qianshanyang, Shaoxing, Jinshan, and other places, which provide sufficient historical reference value. It proves that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a very high culture five or six thousand years ago, and it is certainly not as the legend says that Jiangsu and Zhejiang were still barbaric areas in the Spring and Autumn Period. Now, there must be many of these antiquities remaining in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. I hope that after the establishment of this association, members from various places can continue to discover more for research, so as to understand the evolution of history and the living conditions of our ancestors."</p>
<p>Adoption of Constitution</p>
<p>The constitution was then adopted as follows: (1) This association is named the Wu Yue History and Geography Research Association. (2) The purpose of this association is to study the history and geography of Wu Yue (temporarily limited to the land of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces). (3) Anyone who is interested in studying the history and geography of Wu Yue may apply for membership.

<p>Soliciting Investigation</p>
<p>In order to expand the investigation of antiquities, the association specially organized an Investigation Committee, invited the directors of the education bureaus of various counties to serve as ex officio members, and invited history and Chinese teachers from primary and secondary schools in various counties to serve as investigators. The solicitation letter is recorded as follows: "Respected Sir, this association was established to study the ancient culture of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and is named the Wu Yue History and Geography Research Association. Ancient stone tools used by humans before the use of bronze and iron have been discovered in Nanjing in Jiangsu, and Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Yuhang, Huzhou, and other places in Zhejiang. Pottery contemporary with stone tools has also been discovered in Yancheng in Changzhou, Jiangsu, Wucheng and Yuecheng near Shihu Lake in Suzhou, the coast of Jijiadun in Jinshan, and Zhapu in Pinghu, Zhejiang, Ganpu in Haiyan, and Shaoxing. These pottery wares all have geometric patterns printed on them with cloth. This discovery is of great significance to the ancient culture of Wu Yue. People generally believe that Jiangsu and Zhejiang were still barbaric areas in the Spring and Autumn Period. Since the discovery of these stone tools and pottery, it has been proven that Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a very high culture five or six thousand years ago. We now believe that there are many such stone tools and pottery wares in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, this association has resolved to establish an Investigation Committee, inviting the directors of the education bureaus of various counties to serve as ex officio members, and inviting history and Chinese teachers from primary and secondary schools in various counties to serve as investigators. In your spare time, after meals, and while walking by rivers, ponds, and small hills, please carefully inspect whether there are stone tools and pottery of the type printed on the back scattered on the ground. If you encounter any, whether complete or broken, pick them up and send a letter detailing the circumstances of the discovery, the shape of the stone tools, and the patterns of the pottery, so that this association can send personnel to investigate. If it is considered necessary to excavate, this association will submit a request to the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee for handling. Discoverers will receive considerable rewards. For this reason, we specially invite you to serve as an investigator and enclose samples of stone tools and pottery with this letter. Please investigate carefully. Sincerely, Correspondence Address: Wei Juxian, Central Bank, No. 15 Bund, Shanghai."</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Money Industry Association has a total of 47 member Huihua money shops, including Fuyuan, which have always regarded credit lending as their main business. Since it has been affected by the decline of the entire market, the number of factories, businesses, and companies that have closed down and gone bankrupt has increased, resulting in the credit system being on the verge of bankruptcy. Money shops have suffered greatly from credit lending. In view of this, the managers of various money shops have had to be particularly cautious about credit lending. Anyone who wants to establish a current account with a money shop and overdraft must have a reliable guarantor, and a overdraft limit will be set to reduce risk. Now, factories, companies, and businesses feel that the turnover of funds is quite difficult after the money shops have tightened credit lending, and they all hope that the money industry will restore the previous credit lending system. However, various money shops accept the principle of restoring the credit lending system, but believe that during this period, it must depend on the creditworthiness of the requesting factories, companies, and businesses.</p>

<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the Shanghai General Labor Union and its more than 80 affiliated trade unions held a public banquet for Zhu Xuefan, the representative of the National Labor Congress who had just returned to China, at the Atlantic Restaurant at 12:00 noon yesterday, and invited famous figures from the party and government to accompany him.

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After a few rounds of drinks, Zhou Xuexiang, the acting chairman of the General Labor Union, stood up and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "The city's labor community is holding a public banquet here for Mr. Zhu Xuefan, and many representatives are participating. We are especially honored that famous figures from the party and government have graced us with their presence. Mr. Zhu was appointed by the Central Government to attend the 20th National Labor Congress. As our country's labor representative, he negotiated and advocated for the benefit of the country's workers and won honor for the country. There have been eight sessions of our country's labor representatives attending the National Labor Congress. Looking back on the past, there have never been such good results as Mr. Zhu's attendance this time. At the same time, Mr. Zhu wants to promote our country's labor cause and learn from friendly countries. He has made special trips to various countries to inspect the labor situation and has gained a lot of experience. I hope that Mr. Zhu will contribute the strengths of advanced European and American countries to our country, unify the organization, concentrate our strength, obey the leader, and shoulder the important task of revitalizing the nation and consolidating the party and the country. On behalf of the city's labor community, I sincerely wish Mr. Zhu a bright future." Subsequently, Tong Hangbai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Department, Cheng Haifeng, director of the China Labor Bureau, Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section of the Third Division of the Social Bureau, delivered speeches in succession. (Speeches omitted.)</p>
<p>Zhu's Report</p>
<p>Amid enthusiastic applause, Zhu Xuefan stood up and reported on his experiences attending the National Labor Congress and inspecting the labor situation in various countries, briefly stating, "After I arrived in Rome, Italy, by ship, I was concerned about the labor situation in that country. Before Italy entered Rome, the political, diplomatic, and domestic problems were similar to China's situation and situation. After entering Rome, the political situation gradually became on track, with a comprehensive plan for the country and the people. The people's national concept is very strong. When the national affairs were first settled, labor-capital disputes occurred along with it, which was similar to the situation in our country after the Revolutionary Army established its capital in Nanjing in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China. The Italian people's leader, Mussolini, at this time, felt deeply about the national conditions and promulgated the Labor Charter, which contained 72 articles, stipulating that factories must not suspend operations without reason, and workers are not allowed to strike. In terms of organization, workers have the National Confederation of Trade Unions, and factories have the General Federation of Industrial Associations. In between, there is the establishment of the Industry Cooperation Department. Working hours, wage levels, etc., have labor-capital contracts signed. When labor-capital disputes occur, they are mediated by the general associations representing both workers and employers. If the two sides cannot resolve the dispute, it is submitted to the Labor Court for adjudication, which is carried out in a prompt manner. Once a ruling is made, both parties must absolutely obey. Any party that violates the ruling will be punished with fines and imprisonment. Since Mussolini took office and promulgated the Labor Charter, the increase in production, the reduction in unemployment, and the stability between labor and capital must be attributed to Mussolini alone. Secondly, the labor situation in Germany is somewhat similar to that in Italy. In 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany, the labor policy was laissez-faire. The labor organization was complex and took the same position as the Second International. Since Hitler came to power, he was determined to plan and reorganize the domestic labor organization into the Labor Corps. Hitler himself regarded himself as a protector, with advisors under the protector, factory owners as leaders, and workers as followers. He advocated that factory owners must wholeheartedly care for workers, and workers should enthusiastically reward factory owners. Labor and capital jointly set up a collaborative association. Under the collaborative association, there is a trust committee, which is equal to a trade union organization, and is responsible for labor welfare undertakings, investigating factory treatment of workers, and the production situation of workers. Both parties rely on the report of the trust committee. In addition to the trust committee, a supervisory committee is also established to be responsible for supervising all actions of the trust committee. In addition, there is a nominal court. If labor-capital disputes cannot be resolved, they are submitted to the court for disposal. Therefore, Germany's industrial development has surpassed that of European and American countries. Regarding workers' welfare undertakings, the promotion of sports, and proper entertainment, such as travel and swimming, the facilities are very thorough. Special attention is paid to female workers' childbirth. Insurance for death, accidents, and childbirth is exceptionally developed. The people of Italy and Germany love the country, obey the leader, and the executive personnel are impartial and serve the people. This is the spirit of nation-building that our country is worth emulating. In addition, Zhu also reported that there are an estimated one million overseas Chinese workers. Because the motherland is weak, they are often bullied and their lives are not guaranteed. The tragic situation was described in great detail. However, due to space limitations, more will be reported in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Chamber of Commerce Urges the Ministry of Finance to Lift the Prohibition on Flying Flowers <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, saying, "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 28th of this month, the Shanghai Flying Flowers Industry Association sent a letter stating that the association's member manufacturers were mistakenly listed in the prohibited category by the Jianghai Customs for the Ministry of Finance's prohibition of waste cotton exports. The matter concerns the business of the association's member manufacturers, has a huge impact on the whole, and the public is panicked. The association has sent representatives to the capital and then to Lu to petition the authorities, explaining the point of misunderstanding and prohibiting them together, and presenting the difference between the nature and purpose of waste cotton and flying flowers. On August 14, the representatives returned to Shanghai and reported that Minister Kong had fortunately agreed in person to order the Customs Service to correct the error and restore the original state. The association believes that the petition has been approved, so it is waiting quietly for a clear order, hoping to resume business as soon as possible. Since the export of flying flowers has been mistakenly banned, the business work of member manufacturers has been suspended in both cases, and more than two decades have passed. Not only is the loss incalculable, but the economy has also become difficult, and the lives of tens of thousands of workers have been unable to maintain. Therefore, there is an urgent need to withdraw the ban. For this reason, we urge your association to submit a telegram to the Ministry of Finance based on the facts, and ask the Ministry of Finance to quickly correct the order to mistakenly ban flying flowers, so that the association's industry can restore the original state as soon as possible. The urgency is beyond description. The association has learned that this matter was previously submitted to your department in a telegram on the 5th of this month, asking to handle the ban on exports of flying flowers and waste cotton separately. Subsequently, the association elected representatives to submit a face-to-face report to your department, and cited the fact that Japan does not prohibit the export of flying flowers, and only imports waste cotton as evidence, which is particularly detailed and clear. It is for reference in handling this matter. Subsequently, your department sent a telegram, stating that it had been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and reply, and that it would wait for the government's decision. However, the Yuanri telegram instruction received by the association after submitting this case to the Military Affairs Commission stated that the letter had been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling. It is known that although the motive for discussing the ban is related to military affairs, the Military Affairs Commission still allows your department to directly preside over the review and handling of the separate handling of flying flowers and waste cotton, and there is no claim. This is the main point of this case. After reviewing the situation, it should not take a long time due to repeated consultations. At this time, the Customs announced the prohibition of flying flower exports on August 4, and it has been more than 24 days now. Merchants cannot export goods that have already been transacted, and dare not continue to place orders for those that have not been transacted, resulting in huge losses. I hope that your department will review and verify, and quickly handle the matter separately, and send a telegram to the customs to lift the ban, which is for the public good. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<h3 id="e113">Ministry of Finance: Improving China's Banking Industry; Establishing a Central Reserve Bank to Fulfill Its Mission; Strengthening Commercial Banks to Invigorate Market Finance <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>New News Agency reports: Since the government implemented currency system policies and thoroughly reformed China's finance, it has become stable. The financial authorities are now striving to improve the banking industry, the hub of finance, to systematize it and fully leverage the functions of banks. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank</p>
<p>The central bank is the bank of banks, and the central hub of national finance. Since the establishment of the Central Bank of China, it has achieved considerable results in assisting banks and adjusting finance. For example, in the past two years, the Central Bank, together with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, has provided substantial loans to directly assist fellow banks and indirectly regulate the market, with significant results. Recently, the Board of Directors resolved to increase its capital stock and reorganize into a Central Reserve Bank to promote bill discounting and open market policies, develop the functions of the central bank, and fulfill its mission as the bank of banks. The reorganization plan is actively underway. Once realized, bank credit will be fully utilized, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are expected to develop rapidly, which will greatly benefit the recovery and progress of the national economy.</p>
<p>Developing Specialized Banks</p>
<p>The specialized banks of China, as stipulated by the financial authorities, are of three types: (1) the Bank of China, a bank for developing international remittance; (2) the Bank of Communications, a bank for developing domestic industries; and (3) the Farmers Bank of China, a bank for developing national agriculture. These three banks each have special operations to complete national economic construction. For example, the Bank of China already has branches in London and Osaka and has recently added branches in New York and Singapore to promote the development of Sino-foreign remittance business. As for the Bank of Communications' efforts to invest in industry and the Farmers Bank of China's widespread implementation of rural lending, both are proceeding step by step according to the original plan. In addition, the Bank of Communications increased government shares, and the Farmers Bank of China changed its name and reorganized, and was specially authorized to issue banknotes with the same legal tender status as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The strength of the three banks is even more robust, and their mutual support in developing China's agricultural and industrial sectors is of great significance.</p>
<p>Strengthening Commercial Banks</p>
<p>Commercial banks are the most common and important banks in the country, and they are closely related to the prosperity and decline of commerce. However, among China's commercial banks, there are still few that are large in scale and have strong capital. In cities, there are more small-scale banks. The disadvantage of this phenomenon is that the strength of each bank is dispersed, business is difficult to develop, and competition among peers increases. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, in view of this, requires commercial banks to increase capital, strengthen their strength, and concentrate funds to make the bank organization sound, assist commercial development, and invigorate market finance. For example, the recent merger of the Jiangzhe Bank and the China Remittance Bank, the planning of the Four Bright Bank to increase capital, and the adjustment of the business of the Silk Industry Bank have all been implemented step by step to strengthen the internal organization.</p>
<p>Promoting Savings Banks</p>
<p>The business of savings banks in China is limited by investment opportunities, which are narrow and have failed to develop fully. Therefore, there are few purely savings banks in the country that do not engage in other businesses. To promote savings banks, in addition to the Bank of China adding a savings department, the Central Bank has allocated funds to establish the Central Savings Association to encourage public savings habits and concentrate scattered social capital. At the same time, it is striving to develop transportation, public utilities, and open up new avenues for long-term investment. Therefore, this measure not only utilizes surplus funds and develops enterprises but can also create a thrifty atmosphere for society.</p>
<p>Implementing Banking Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>China's banking laws and regulations have been promulgated, and all banks should earnestly abide by them. Now, China's banking system has taken shape. All banking laws and regulations, such as the Central Bank Law, the Banking Law, the Savings Bank Law, the Trust Law, and the Special Bank Regulations, are said to have been decided to be revised in detail and will soon be implemented to protect the rights of depositors. In the future, when commercial banks apply for registration, the total amount of opening capital and the qualifications of the promoters and managers must be strictly examined before approval can be granted. If, after the bank opens, its business scope, operating methods, and business conditions must be subject to official inspection at any time and reported to the Ministry of Finance in a timely and truthful manner to protect the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Hengfeng, Dengsan Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Party and Government Mediation Signed Four Items <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the workers of Hengfeng, Youfeng, Daxin, and other three silk weaving factories on Haizhou Road, Yangshupu, went on strike to demand the restoration of their original wages. The party and government organs, fearing that the dispute would be prolonged and affect the factory's business and the workers' livelihoods, specially convened both labor and management to mediate the matter the previous morning. An amicable agreement was immediately signed for four items, including a general wage increase of six li and the reinstatement of dismissed workers. All the workers of the factories entered the factory to work at 6:30 yesterday morning in good order. All the Chinese and Western detectives stationed by the relevant police station withdrew after the workers resumed work.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Meiya Second Factory Labor and Contractor Settle Negotiation; Factory Accepts Cancellation of Grades; Workers Abandon Remaining Conditions <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that after the Meiya Second Silk Weaving Factory (now renamed Heji) on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, had a strike because the workers demanded a general increase of one cent per meter of work and the abolition of the grading system, the party and government organs and the General Labor Union sent personnel to mediate, but to no avail. Under the direct renegotiation between labor and the contractor the night before, the factory (contractor) has accepted the abolition of the grading system and included the B and C grades in the A grade calculation. The workers also expressed their automatic abandonment of the conditions such as the general increase in wages, the restoration of 90% wages, and the treatment of new workers entering the factory. Therefore, the dispute was resolved. The male and female workers of the night shift all entered the factory to resume work the night before.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Workers from Various Departments of the Anglo-American Third Factory to Petition Today <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that since the workers of the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Third Factory (renamed Yizhong Tobacco Company) on Huade Road, Pudong, have been engaging in a go-slow, all work in various departments has come to a standstill, and preparations are being made to recruit new workers. All the workers have submitted eight conditions to petition the party and government organs. However, the factory's attitude is to deal with it resolutely. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recruiting New Workers</p>
<p>The factory's entire workforce of male and female workers, in opposition to the harsh treatment of workers by the Chinese manager Wei Ziqian and the dismissal of female workers, has been engaging in a go-slow for two weeks. Since the occurrence of the worker go-slow, work in various departments has completely stopped. Moreover, at this time of cool autumn weather, when production is being stepped up, it has suffered a small loss due to this impact. In order to maintain operations, it has been decided to recruit new workers to enter the factory to work. However, after the workers received this news, they have formed a team to conduct strict inquiries and monitor the entry of new workers into the factory.</p>
<p>Petition This Morning</p>
<p>The factory notified the striking workers to settle their due wages yesterday, but all the workers, fearing that the factory would take the opportunity to monitor their actions, did not go to the factory to collect them. Yesterday was a weekly holiday. All the workers have decided to go to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Bureau, the General Labor Union, and other organs this morning to petition. At the same time, they will submit the eight conditions agreed upon to the English supervisor Herbert for direct negotiation.</p>
<p>Factory Attitude</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reporter recently inquired with the factory about how to resolve the current turmoil. According to the person in charge, after all the workers engaged in a go-slow, the highest responsible person in the factory had expressed acceptance of the workers' demands, and it could have been resolved earlier. However, the workers insisted that personnel issues be a prerequisite, which is actually interfering with the factory's administration. Now, the factory still hopes that the workers will resume work as soon as possible. As for any demands, it should be discussed at length. If the workers are obsessed, the factory will take resolute measures to maintain operations.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai regarding the aftermath of the Daishan tragedy, saying: To the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, I have received your telegram. Regarding the Daishan incident, I have previously sent a telegram in response to your letter, detailing the actual situation of the case. I have now received a further report of the situation. Upon investigation, only the person who initiated the trouble should be investigated. The rest of the accomplices should be spared from implication. As for the crackdown on fishing and salt, the situation should be carefully considered again, and proper methods of improvement should be discussed. All of these have been ordered by the Ministry to the Liangzhe Transport Envoy to comply with. As for maintaining order, in order to learn from past mistakes and prevent future troubles, it is necessary to deploy police teams to suppress and appease the people. In addition to reissuing an order to the Salt Affairs Inspectorate to instruct the tax police team to strictly restrain themselves and carefully handle matters, I hope you will reply accordingly. Ministry of Finance, You Yan Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Japanese Consular Conference Ends; Each Returns to Post; Kagesa Returns to Country Yesterday Morning <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul General Conference in South and Central China, with Taota, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the center, was held from the 27th.

Nakamura, stationed in Guangdong, has not returned to his country since he was transferred from Fujian to Guangdong, so he decided to take the opportunity to return to his country from Shanghai on the 2nd of next month. It is also learned that Suma's return to Beijing this time carries Kawagoe's orders regarding the Chengdu incident. Before his departure, he visited Kawagoe again at his Bixun Road residence at around 4:00 in the afternoon for a long talk. At the same time, Taota also went to Beijing with Suma last night and may return to Shanghai to wait for a ship to return to his country. In addition, Kagesa, the chief of the Manchu-Mongolian Class, a representative of the Japanese Army Ministry, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and, together with Kita, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, convened a meeting of military attaches.

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai's Total Citizen Report on Opium Smokers Decided to Extend to September 10th Deadline; Municipal Government and Commissioner's Office Posted Announcement <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Commissioner's Office for Reporting Drug Trafficking and Registering Opium Smokers in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality recently issued Announcement No. 354, which reads: "The Military Commission of the National Government and the Chief Supervisor of Opium Suppression Instruction No. 2607 states that Item 4530 of August 15, 25, requests an extension of the deadline for registering opium smokers and reporting drug trafficking for one month, until September 10, in order to achieve complete success. The request is noted and should be approved. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Commissioner Ma Liang for Registering Opium Smokers and Reporting Drug Trafficking to be informed, you are to instruct the Public Security Bureau to register all opium smokers in the city within the deadline, without leaving out any. In accordance with Article 7 of the Measures for Registering Opium Smokers and the instructions of Instruction No. 1019, prepare a statistical summary table of the number of registered opium smokers in the city, together with the city government's affidavit, and submit it to the Commissioner for verification. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to comply, the following announcement is made known to all." This announcement was issued in August of the 25th year of the Republic of China by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Commissioner Ma Liang.</p>
<p>New News Agency reports that since the Municipal Public Security Bureau received the order to start the total citizen report on opium smokers in this city on May 10, the original deadline was this month, the 10th. Later, due to special circumstances, the Drug Trafficking Commissioner and the Opium Smokers Reporting Commissioner jointly petitioned the Opium Suppression Supervisory Department to extend the deadline by one month, so that this city could increase its opportunities for self-renewal. The reporter specially visited Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the Opium Suppression Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, yesterday, who announced the recent opium suppression situation, saying that the Opium Suppression Commissioner's Office in this city was established on May 5, and the Opium Smokers Registration and Reporting by the Public Security Bureau started on the 10th. After being approved by the Opium Suppression Supervisory Department to postpone it for one month, it was set for September 10th. The reporting of opium smokers will end at the same time as the Opium Suppression Commissioner's Office in this city. The report that the reporting of opium smokers will end on the 31st is slightly inconsistent with the facts. In recent days, the Public Security Bureau has specially ordered its subordinates to intensify the investigation and crackdown work, and Section Chief Dai has gone to each branch to instruct the special police officers in charge of investigation and crackdown to urge them to intensify their work. As of yesterday, statistics show that more than 19,000 people have renewed their licenses in the second phase, more than 21,000 people have registered, and more than 13,000 people have quit opium addiction. More than 100 opium cases are solved every day. There are still many opium smokers quitting in various hospitals. In order to fundamentally eliminate opium smokers, the bureau will handle affidavits of residence after the total reporting deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Gu Zhuxuan Cannot Bear Life in Prison and Seeks Legal Relief; Hopes to Offset Prison Time with Days of Detention; Has Hired Lawyer to Petition Court for Release <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was arrested by the French Concession Police and sent to the Second Special Court for trial in connection with the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. He was sentenced to imprisonment. During the appeal period, he was detained outside the prison for illness and bribed the guards to smoke opium. The prisoners reported him, and the French Police Affairs Department filed a public prosecution. The Second Special Court sentenced him to eight months in prison. Gu refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Third Branch Court. As a result, on June 26, the murder case was completely revoked, and the original sentence was declared not guilty. The opium case was still sentenced to eight months in prison, with deprivation of civil rights for one year and abstinence for two months. After the final judgment was made on July 15 and sent to the Second Special Prison for execution, Gu filed a petition with the High Third Branch Court, requesting exemption from abstinence and exemption from the execution of the unexpired prison term. The High Third Branch Court consulted the Institute of Forensic Medicine to send a forensic doctor to assess Gu's opium addiction and confirmed that he had quit. The High Third Branch Court has ruled that Gu Zhuxuan's abstinence punishment is exempt from execution, and the other requests were rejected (i.e., the exemption from the sentence was not allowed). Therefore, after receiving this ruling in prison, calculating the prison term, it will expire on January 12 next year, which is still half a year away. Feeling that life in prison is too bitter, he has recently hired a lawyer to seek other legal relief and has filed a petition with the High Third Branch Court on Gu's behalf, requesting that all the days Gu has been detained since his arrest be offset against the prison term. Gu was arrested by the French Concession Police on September 10 of last year and transferred to the Second Special Court for detention in connection with the Tang Jiapeng assassination case. To date, it has been eleven months and twenty-one days. If all the days of detention are offset against the eight-month prison term for the opium case, he has been detained for three months and twenty-one days more and should be released. It is said that whether the High Third Branch Court will approve this request is still under study by the presiding judge of the High Court, as there is no precedent for this type of request, and there are no provisions in the law to rely on.</p>

Wang held a grudge. He lost money and was slapped, and the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. After a while, he waited near Yuanfang Road and McTavish Road. When Weng passed by, Wang rushed forward, twisted him, and punched and kicked him, knocking him to the ground, almost lifeless. Wang immediately fled. Weng was carried back to Yihe Workshop at No. 352 Dongbailaohui Road, where he died at 7:00 am on the 15th.

<h3 id="e128">This Year's Cotton Production Increases Sharply; Export to Japan is the Only Way Out <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>New News Agency reports that due to favorable weather and abundant agricultural production this year, the cotton harvest has also doubled compared to previous years. The estimated output is about 10 million dan. New cotton has been coming on the market in various places, and the cotton market has gradually become active. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Coming on the Market One After Another: According to the Cotton Industry Control Association, due to weather conditions, the time for new cotton to come on the market in various places varies by two or three weeks. The first to arrive in Shanghai was the Yuyao cotton from Zhejiang Province, two batches of which have already been transported. Cotton from Tongzhou, Haizhou, Taicang, and other places in Jiangsu Province has also arrived in Shanghai for sale. New cotton from Shaanxi and Henan provinces will have to come on the market one or two weeks later because the climate there is different from that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Only Way Out: The harvest in cotton-producing areas this year is more abundant than in previous years. According to cotton production estimates, the cotton fields in the main cotton-producing areas are more than 50 million mu, producing more than 16 million dan of lint cotton, which is the highest cotton production figure in the past 20 years. However, the estimated national cotton consumption is only about 10 million dan, and there is still a large surplus. The only way out is to rely on low prices to export to Japan.</p>
<p>Price Equilibrium: As new cotton comes on the market, various yarn mills have been buying it one after another, preparing to increase production to meet the needs of the autumn and winter market. The cotton market situation has gradually become active. Due to the abundant cotton harvest this year, coupled with the weak quotations for foreign cotton, the prices are extremely balanced. The opening price of high-grade new cotton is only between 42 and 43 yuan, and the price of September-October futures cotton is also within 40 yuan.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Martial Arts Hall is enrolling members.

<p>Mayor's Cup Match</p>
<p>Finally, the Mayor's Cup final was announced, and the audience became even more excited. The Zhonghua team was a rising star and had a strong desire to win. Lin Gendu broke the record first. Shunji's Luo Douwen, Zhang Jinhai, and other athletes were not willing to be outdone and launched a large-scale counterattack. Under heavy pressure from Zhonghua, they lost two goals in succession. After the time was reported, Shunji won the Mayor's Cup with a score of 2-1.</p>

<p>Middle Bar Rematch Final</p>
<p>The middle bar rematch was held at 3:00 PM, divided into two groups, with six people in each group. The top three participants were selected to participate in the final. In the first group, the world record holder, American athlete Harding, and the Far East record holder, Filipino athlete Whyte, competed fiercely. At the last bar, they were only half a step apart. Harding sprinted faster and won the first place by one and a half meters. German athlete Gulden had a good speed in the first five bars, posing a threat to Harding, but his stamina was insufficient and he was eventually eliminated. The third and fourth runners arrived at the finish line at the same time. The referee could not determine the ranking for a while. After the photo was developed, the decision was made. One person was able to participate in the final, while the other failed. There were both lucky and unfortunate people. In the first group, American athlete Patterson won extremely easily, reaching the finish line one meter ahead. The second and third places were very close. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Ha (United States) 53.2 seconds</p>
<p>Whyte (Philippines) 53.4 seconds</p>
<p>Mantikass (Greece) 53.5 seconds</p>
<p>(The following three were eliminated)</p>

<p>(The following three were eliminated)</p>
<p>Bossmans (Belgium) 53.4 seconds</p>
<p>Kovacs (Hungary) 54 seconds</p>
<p>Noteblock (Germany) 54.8 seconds</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM in the final, Harding was on the outermost lane, followed by Mantikass, Whyte, Magalhaes, and Laurin. Patterson was on the innermost lane. In the first two bars, all six people started and landed at the same time. After that, Harding gradually gained an advantage. After turning into the straight line at the third turn, Harding was one meter ahead. Whyte followed closely, and Laurin was also sprinting desperately behind. By the time they reached the finish line, Harding still maintained a distance of one meter and won the first place. Laurin defeated Whyte by one shoulder. Patterson, who had the best result in the rematch, fell back to fourth place. The other two were ten meters behind. Harding's result was 52.4 seconds, which was much lower than his world record of 50.6 seconds set in 1934 and his Olympic record of 52 seconds set in 1932.</p>
<p>(1) Harding (United States) 52.3 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Laurin (Canada) 52.8 seconds</p>

<p>800-Meter Final</p>
<p>The 800-meter final was held at 4:45 PM. Eight people qualified for the final. Two people had to be eliminated, so the competition was extremely fierce. When the gun was fired, Italian athlete Lanci false started. This was a rare phenomenon in track and field races. The race restarted. Canadian black Edwards took the lead and led the crowd. American black Woodlerov was in fourth place, following leisurely. In the first lap, sixteen flying legs advanced side by side, chasing closely. At 600 meters, Woodlerov enlarged his steps, relaxed as usual, and jumped to replace Edwards in the front. Edwards was unwilling to give in and once again bravely strived to be the first. It was just a flash in the pan. Woodlerov went out again at 700 meters and accelerated, sprinting desperately. At the same time, Italian athlete Lanci was also stepping forward behind. Although Edwards gritted his teeth and fought bravely, he was exhausted. As a result, Woodlerov won first place by three meters. The result was 1 minute 52.9 seconds, which was not outstanding. The second, third, and fourth places were one step apart. The United Kingdom was in a downturn, and McCabber and Bakerhouse of Hampshire were eliminated. (The world record and the Olympic record are both held by Hampson of the United Kingdom at 1 minute 49.7 seconds.)</p>
<p>(1) Woodlerov (United States) 1 minute 52.9 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Lanci (Italy) 1 minute 53.3 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Edwards (Canada) 1 minute 53.6 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Koczyski (Poland) 1 minute 53.8 seconds</p>
<p>(5) Hombestal (United States) 1 minute 54.6 seconds</p>
<p>(6) Williamson (United States) 1 minute 55.8 seconds</p>
<p>(5) (10) Fifth Day of the Games</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the Games, the weather was even worse. There was heavy rain during the pole vault trials at 12:00 PM, and there was heavy rain again at 6:00 PM. The weather was cold, resembling early winter. The crowd was crowded, but it did not diminish slightly. In addition to the track and field competition, there was a modern pentathlon (swimming), fencing, and rowing in the morning, and polo, fencing, hockey, football (Austria vs. Egypt, Poland vs. Hungary), fencing, and weightlifting in the afternoon. The Chinese martial arts team was originally scheduled to perform at the Games venue after the track and field was over, but because the pole vault final did not end until 9:00 PM, the time was too late, so the performance was rescheduled. The results of various track and field events are as follows:</p>
<p>Pole Vault Sino-American-Japanese War</p>
<p>The pole vault final became a confrontation between the American and Japanese athletes, a major battle, which was one of the most exciting scenes in the five days of the Games. Although they fought at night, the order of the top five was not decided until 9:05 PM. However, the spectators who cheered and cheered watched the game with great interest. The trial was held at 10:30 AM, with a total of 35 participants. It was stipulated that they must jump over 3.80 meters to participate in the final in the afternoon. The trial was divided into four groups, starting at 3.50 meters. A total of 25 people jumped over 3.80 meters. Chinese athlete Fu Baolu failed in the first jump at 3.80 meters. It was almost noon. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and there was a heavy rain, so it was stopped for 20 minutes. After the rain stopped, Fu jumped over lightly and freely, which was the only one in the Chinese track and field team to win the right to the final. The final began at 4:00 PM, starting at 3.60 meters. French athlete Klibin failed in three jumps and was the first to step down. When it was increased to 3.80 meters, Chilean athlete Sohlegel also retired. When it was increased to 4 meters, 16 people jumped over. An Kui Tao from Japan, who was defeated by Fu Baolu in the last Far East Games, was also among those who jumped over. Fu Baolu was timid and failed three times, so he was eliminated. When it was increased to 4.15 meters, Japanese athletes Nishida Shuhei and Oie Kio, and American athletes Meadows and Gray Reb, all passed on the first jump. Another American athlete, Sefton, passed on the second jump. The other 11 people all completed their merits. The pole vault final became a situation where the United States and three Japanese athletes confronted each other. At this time, the emotions of more than 100,000 spectators were extremely tense. When the Japanese athletes jumped, they all cheered and cheered, especially for Nishida Shuhei, who cheered even more enthusiastically. When the American athletes jumped, they whistled and made strange noises. This phenomenon may be caused by the psychology of helping the weak and eliminating the strong. But no matter whether it was cheering or strange noises, everyone became quiet and silent when they held the pole forward. When it was increased to 4.25 meters, Seton and Nishida both jumped over on the first jump. Meadows, Oie, and Gray Reb all failed to jump over. Among them, it was a pity that Gray Reb's whole body passed the bar very high, but he failed by touching the bar with his hand. On the second jump, when Meadows passed the bar, his left arm touched the bar, but it did not fall off, which was very lucky. Oie followed and jumped over, and the wilting momentum was quite natural. However, Gray Reb, who held the world record (4.37 meters), failed three times and ranked fifth. When it was increased to 4.35 meters, it was already a new record for the Games. (The old record was set by American athlete Miller, the champion of the previous Games. At this time, the twilight was vast, but fortunately the lighting equipment in the venue was excellent, and the lighting after the opening was as bright as day, so it could continue to be held. On the first jump, none of the four people passed. On the second jump, Meadows exerted all his strength and flew in with the pole, passing the bar with a beautiful posture. The whole venue burst into applause and cheers. The other three people all failed to jump three times, so Meadows settled in the top spot. When it was increased to 4.45 meters to try to create a record, Meadows had already jumped over his whole body, but his chest touched the bar when he landed, so he failed, which was a pity. In the next two jumps, he was exhausted and his performance stopped at 4.35 meters. Fu Dun, Oie, and Nishida competed for second place. They first jumped 4.35 meters, but none of them passed. When it was reduced to 4.25 meters, it was still the same. When it was reduced to 4.15 meters, Sefton still failed. Oie and Nishida jumped over one after another. Because they were from the same country, they did not want to compete again, so they tied for second place. This fierce battle did not end until 9:05 PM. Because it was too late for sixth place, they could not jump again, so the 11 people tied for the sixth place.</p>
<p>(1) Meadows (United States) 4.35</p>

<p>50,000-Meter Race Walk</p>
<p>The starting point and the finish line of the 50,000-meter race walk are both in the middle of the Games venue. The route taken is in the suburbs of Berlin. It starts at 1:30 PM. A report is made on the unveiling plate every considerable distance after leaving the Games venue. Therefore, the audience does not need to follow the racers to walk together, and they can also understand the progress of the competition. At 6:00 PM, British athlete Whitelock first walked into the venue amid the thunderous cheers of the whole venue. In less than two minutes, Swiss athlete Schweber also followed closely. After that, a competitor came in every two or three minutes. The four Chinese athletes participated, but each country was only allowed to participate in three events in each competition, so Zheng Chengshan did not participate. Cai Zhengyi, Zhou Yuyu, and Zhang Zaojiu did not perform well. Cai won 23rd place with a time of 5 hours 17 minutes, Zhou won 25th place with a time of 5 hours 25 minutes, and Zhang won 26th place with a time of 5 hours 29 minutes. As a result of the competition, the top 14 all broke the Games record (the old record was 4 hours 50 minutes and 10 seconds set by British athlete Green in 1932), which is really commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Central Implementation: Remedial Education for Out-of-School People (2): Ministry of Education's Radio Broadcasts and Lectures <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned counties and cities being required to establish people's schools in various townships in stages, all private schools, organizations, institutions, large factories, farms, stores, and companies in all cities across the country (such as the capital and the locations of provincial and municipal governments) and in areas with developed industry and commerce must establish at least one affiliated people's school to supplement the efforts of the township people's schools where their strength is insufficient.</p>
<p>After the above six-year deadline expires, by July of the Republic of China year 11, a total of 191 million out-of-school people in counties and cities across the country will have received training. The number of people in the people's schools affiliated with various institutions is not included in this calculation. Most out-of-school people under the age of 45 can receive training, and illiteracy can be eliminated throughout the country. B. Phased Provisions for the Number of Trainees: All out-of-school people aged 16 to 45 are the target of education, but because the number is too large to implement simultaneously, two phases should be specified as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Phase 1: That is, from the first year to the fourth year, a total of 86 million people can be trained. Priority should be given to training out-of-school men and women aged 16 to 30.</p>
<p>(2) Phase 2: That is, from the fifth year to the sixth year, all out-of-school men and women under the age of 45 will receive general training.</p>
<p>C. Compulsory Enrollment: In areas where people's schools have been widely established and are sufficient to accommodate the local out-of-school population, all physically healthy out-of-school young people and adult men and women should be ordered by the local organizations in charge of remedial education for out-of-school people to enroll in people's schools according to their age and family situation. Those who should enroll but do not will be given a written warning to their parents, guardians, employers, or themselves, setting a deadline for them to attend school. Those who do not heed the warning may have their names publicly posted as a warning. Those who still do not comply may be fined by the county or city education administrative agency, with the approval of the county government, from one yuan to five yuan, and still be ordered to enroll within a deadline. This fine can be used for the remedial education of out-of-school people in various localities.</p>
<p>D. Regulations on Deferred or Exempted Enrollment: Out-of-school people who have illnesses or other reasons that temporarily prevent them from enrolling may have their parents, guardians, employers, or themselves submit a written request for exemption. Those who have completed short-term primary schools or people's schools are considered to have received remedial education. Those who have received education equivalent to that of people's schools in private schools, families, or factories, companies, or stores, and have passed the examination by the local people's school and been certified, are considered to have received adult remedial education and may be exempted from enrollment.</p>
<p>E. People's Schools Should Be Established Independently in Rural Areas in Principle: The establishment of people's schools in counties and cities should follow the standards of autonomous regions, neighborhoods, townships, and towns. In the first year, one school should be established in a suitable location in each township, and then additional schools should be established year by year. Within the six-year deadline, efforts should be made to ensure that all out-of-school men and women in the entire township receive training to the extent possible. Those that can be established independently should be established independently as much as possible. When it becomes necessary in the future, they can be converted into higher-level people's schools or people's education centers to serve as the central institutions for promoting social education and improving rural areas.</p>
<p>3. Preparations for Implementation</p>
<p>Implementing remedial education for out-of-school people involves a large number of people and requires significant funding. All necessary teachers, school buildings, equipment, etc. must be comprehensively planned and prepared in advance. The matters that need to be prepared are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Training Teachers: According to Article 4 of the Outline of Measures, each county and city should add 20 to 40 schools starting from the 25th year of the Republic. Calculating an average of 30 schools per county, a total of 60,000 schools should be added nationwide in the 2,000 counties and cities. Assuming one principal/teacher per school, 60,000 teachers are needed. Starting from the second year, each county will add 20 schools, and a total of 40,000 schools will need to be added nationwide in the 2,000 counties and cities. Another 40,000 teachers must be added each year. Based on this calculation, 60,000 teachers are needed in the first year, 40,000 more are needed in the second year, totaling 100,000. 140,000 are needed in the third year, 180,000 are needed in the fourth year, 220,000 are needed in the fifth year, and 260,000 are needed in the sixth year. The number of people's schools with two or more classes, teachers other than the principal, and teachers in people's schools affiliated with various institutions and organizations are not included in this calculation. Therefore, the item of teachers must be prepared in advance and trained first in order to be allocated. The education departments of each province should establish teacher training classes for people's education in various regions, recruit students with the equivalent of junior high school graduation level, provide them with two months of training, and, after passing the examination, distribute them to counties and cities to serve as principals or teachers of people's schools. Municipalities directly under the central government should handle this in the location of the municipal government. If the trained teachers are still insufficient for allocation, they may consider appointing civil servants to serve concurrently as teachers of people's schools.</p>
<p>B. Raising Funds: To popularize remedial education for out-of-school people, the funds for running people's schools are to be managed by the municipal government in municipalities directly under the central government. In counties and cities in provinces, the principle is that the provinces and counties should share the burden as appropriate. When the central government has sufficient funds in the future, it may also subsidize them as appropriate. The funds for remedial education for out-of-school people in each province and city should be allocated according to the local situation, either from the provincial and municipal education funds or by designating a certain percentage from the total income of the province and city. The provincial and municipal education departments should prepare a budget each year before the start of the year. The funds for remedial education for out-of-school people in counties and cities should be allocated according to the local situation, either by designating schools or by designating special taxes. People should also be encouraged to donate as much as possible. Each county and city government should include it in the budget each year before the start of the year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e176">Re-discussing the Reform of the Currency System in Guangdong Province <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Deguang</p>
<p>(1) Key Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province, the author published an article titled "A Humble Suggestion for Reforming the Currency System in Guangdong Province" in this publication last week, advocating: (1) Using the existing silver in Guangdong Province as cash reserves to issue 120 million yuan of new legal tender in the form of silver dollars, with central government bonds allocated as the guarantee reserve; (2) Stipulating a ratio of one silver dollar legal tender to 1.6 yuan of subsidiary notes, and gradually withdrawing 192 million yuan of subsidiary notes with the newly issued legal tender, while issuing Guangdong Financial Treasury Bills to absorb the remaining subsidiary notes as much as possible; (3) Stipulating methods for legal tender to repay debts: all public and private debts incurred before Guangdong Province promulgated the order to centralize silver (the previous article advocated using November 3rd of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) as the dividing line for debts, out of respect for central government laws and regulations, but since the implementation date of legal tender in Guangdong Province was relatively late, the local situation can be considered, taking the date of Guangdong Province's announcement of this order as the standard), all debts should be repaid in national currency according to the ratio of adding 44%; those incurred after that date should all be repaid in national currency according to the ratio of adding 6%; (4) Continue to issue 10 million yuan of silver dollar legal tender to purchase silver from the public at the ratio of adding, with all of it allocated to the legal tender reserve fund. However, the above four points are merely the major outlines of the reform plan. As for the implementation steps and detailed methods, they still need to await considerable investigation and research before they can be determined. After the manuscript was completed and published in this journal, I also saw a newspaper report on Minister of Finance Kong's talk about reorganizing the currency system in Guangdong Province. To sum up, the content of his talk can be divided into four points: (1) The reorganization of the Guangdong currency should be based on the interests of all the people of Guangdong, and should not focus on the gains and losses of a few people, and it is even more necessary to strictly prevent the malpractices of excessive banknote issuance and improper transactions in the past. (2) The credit of Guangdong Province's subsidiary notes should be strengthened urgently, so it is necessary to first supplement the 7% shortfall in the cash reserve item and complete the guarantee reserve. (3) After the necessary procedures are completed, the Ministry of Finance will properly determine the exchange method and implement legal tender. (4) During the transition period, all receipts and payments are still allowed to use subsidiary notes as usual, but all tax revenues, if based on the central government's legal tender, should be converted into silver dollar legal tender at the market price of the day if legal tender is not available, but shall not exceed the calculation of adding 5%. Based on this, the central government has now set accurate steps for reorganizing the Guangdong currency. In the future, the establishment of the Central Bank, the issuance of silver dollar legal tender, the centralization of reserves, and the unification of foreign exchange are all technical issues in the reform and are not necessary to discuss. The biggest key to this is that there seems to be no decisive solution at present, which is the ratio of subsidiary notes to silver dollars. Now I would like to offer my personal humble opinion and reiterate the previous proposal for discussion.</p>
<p>(2) Author's Main Points</p>
<p>The previous article advocated that the ratio of subsidiary notes to national currency be set at adding 6%, and explained that by withdrawing subsidiary notes at this ratio, the people of Guangdong would only lose 10%, and the central government would also be able to handle it with ease, which is a win-win solution for reorganizing the currency system in Guangdong Province. However, some people may doubt my proposal, thinking that the ratio (the height of the ratio referred to in this article refers to the amount of water added when subsidiary notes are converted into silver dollars) is too high, which is tantamount to devaluing the currency value of Guangdong Province, and they are deeply afraid that this will affect prices and reduce the property of the people of Guangdong. In fact, my proposal is only the natural devaluation of subsidiary notes, not the devaluation of silver dollars. Now I would like to further clarify the impact on foreign trade, remittances from overseas Chinese, property income, and prices, finance, and industry, in order to clarify my point. However, there is still a prerequisite issue here: whether the central government will initially implement legal tender in Guangdong, allowing legal tender and subsidiary notes to circulate in the market at the same time, or stipulate that all receipts and payments should only be made with legal tender, while subsidiary notes can only be used to exchange legal tender. Although these two methods are only different in terms of gradual progress and rapid progress, they are essentially different paths. However, based on the current situation and considering local public opinion, it is appropriate to adopt a gradual approach. Now let us assume that a gradual approach is adopted, and after the implementation of the new currency system, legal tender and subsidiary notes are used together, and then explain the impact that will occur as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Trade After the implementation of the new currency system, the exchange rate will be stabilized, reducing the risks borne by merchants in foreign trade, as described in the previous article. As for the level of the ratio of subsidiary notes to national currency, it does not have much impact on import and export merchants. Because Guangdong Province's foreign trade, whether export or import, mostly goes through foreign commercial firms, using silver dollars or Hong Kong banknotes as the standard, which has little relationship with the level of foreign exchange. For importers who placed orders abroad before the reform and whose accounts have been settled before the goods are sold, the amount gained from the increase in selling price can compensate for the loss of currency devaluation, so there is no loss or gain. For those whose goods have not been sold and whose accounts have not been settled, although they will lose due to the currency devaluation when settling accounts, they will gain from the rise in prices when selling goods, so there is also no loss or gain. Those who place orders abroad after the reform will calculate the cost of selling goods using the new currency or converting it according to the new currency, so there is no loss or gain. Only those who placed orders before the reform and whose goods have been sold but whose payments have not been settled will inevitably suffer considerable losses; however, if they use the proceeds from the sale to purchase other goods in advance, the losses and gains will offset each other. (If payments are collected according to the legal tender implementation method described below, there will also be no loss or gain.) On the other hand, exporters who sold goods before the reform and whose goods have been shipped but whose payments have not been received will inevitably suffer losses because the price of goods has not risen but the currency value has fallen, but those who use Hong Kong dollars as the standard will also have no loss or gain. The same is true for those whose goods have not been shipped and whose payments have not been received, but who have already accepted orders. Those who accept orders after the reform can appropriately increase the price of goods even though the currency value is low, so there is also no gain or loss. In short, the level of the conversion rate (that is, the conversion rate between silver dollars and national currency, the same below) has no major impact on exporters and merchants; however, given the huge trade deficit in Guangdong Province in recent years, slightly devaluing the currency value to promote exports and suppress imports is also a good idea. However, if the currency value is excessively devalued, it will be greatly unfavorable to those who hold subsidiary notes. Therefore, weighing the two, the ratio of adding 6% seems to be quite appropriate. This is my first reason for semi-suppressing the value of subsidiary notes.</p>
<p>(2) Remittances from Overseas Chinese A large number of our Guangdong compatriots reside overseas. Over the decades, the amount of their hard-earned money remitted back to their motherland is considerable. According to Mr. Huang Yuanbin's estimate, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in the 54 years since the Guangxu era has reached 6.2 billion yuan, a huge amount that is truly astonishing. Even during the recent period of economic downturn, the estimated amount remitted back each year is still more than 200 million yuan, of which Guangdong Province should account for at least half. This is truly a huge source of finance and industry for Guangdong Province. Our country's foreign trade has a trade deficit every year. The total trade deficit over the past few decades is about 7.5 billion yuan. Even in the recent three years, the average annual trade deficit is still as high as 50 million yuan. This huge loss in international balance of payments is mostly offset by the intangible income from remittances from overseas Chinese. The amount of remittances from overseas Chinese each year varies due to their own economic environment, and is also closely related to the level of exchange rates between countries. For example, during the global silver price crisis in 1920, overseas Chinese remitted hundreds of millions of yuan back to Guangdong. Conversely, in recent years of low silver prices, the amount of remittances has decreased relatively. Therefore, if the central government slightly devalues the value of subsidiary notes in this reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province, so that those who remit money back to Guangdong will receive considerable benefits in intangible ways, it will not only attract a large number of remittances from overseas Chinese in the short term, allowing Guangdong Province's finance to increase its activity, funds to be more abundant, and industries to develop, which will greatly benefit the economic recovery of Guangdong Province. This is the second reason why the value of subsidiary notes should be suppressed.</p>
<p>(3) Property Income A family's property and an individual's actual income do not increase or decrease due to changes in currency value, just as the amount of national wealth does not increase or decrease due to changes in the price of gold and silver. Gold and silver currency are only a measure of wealth value and a medium of exchange, and they lose their greatest utility outside of this. Paper money cannot be compared with the gold and silver it represents. Moreover, since the excessive issuance of subsidiary notes in Guangdong Province from November of last year to June of this year, it has lost its nature as a measure of value. Therefore, the value of subsidiary notes is low, and the value of property, except for the subsidiary notes themselves, can be said to be unchanged. The devaluation of subsidiary notes is originally a change in the ratio between subsidiary notes and national currency, not a change in the exchange ratio between Guangdong Province's property and property in other provinces and countries. Now let's use the example mentioned in the previous article to clarify it. For example, Shanghai produces goods A and Guangzhou produces goods B. The prices of goods A and B are both one yuan of national currency in Shanghai and 1.4 yuan of Guangdong currency in Guangzhou. After Guangdong Province's reform, anyone who has goods B can sell them in Shanghai and get one yuan of national currency, which is equivalent to 1.6 yuan of Guangdong currency. Therefore, merchants in Guangdong Province who have goods B or goods A will not have any changes in the value of their property due to the reform. Furthermore, from the perspective of foreign trade, for example, the price of Guangdong raw silk is 500 yuan of Guangdong currency per package, and the price of American wheat flour is 100 US dollars per package. At that time, the ratio of Guangdong currency to US dollars was 1 to 5 (Guangdong currency has never obtained a position in foreign exchange, and cannot actually be exchanged with the United States. This ratio is only converted from other currencies). Then exporting one package of raw silk can get 100 US dollars, and importing 10 packages of American wheat also requires 100 US dollars. That is, one package of raw silk can be exchanged for 10 packages of American wheat. After Guangdong Province's reform, assuming that the ratio of Guangdong currency to US dollars changes to 1 to 6, and the price of raw silk is not affected by the difference in supply and demand of the goods themselves, then its price should not change much, and it is still 100 US dollars. That is, exporting one package of raw silk can get 600 yuan of Guangdong currency, and importing 10 packages of wheat flour also requires 600 yuan of Guangdong currency. The exchange ratio of Guangdong silk and American wheat is still unchanged. From the perspective of the entire regional economy, the value of all property owned by the people of Guangdong Province does not increase or decrease due to the rise and fall of currency prices. Similarly, using this to disprove personal property income, after the reform, in addition to those who hold subsidiary notes and inevitably lose 10%, although the nominal income of the rest of the general public will decrease, the purchasing power of the national currency has obviously changed from before. Except for sporadic consumption that may be slightly more costly than before, the actual income remains unchanged. This can also be asserted.</p>
<p>(4) Prices The rise and fall of prices is actually a reflection of the rise and fall of currency value. If this reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province implements a 1% devaluation of the value of subsidiary notes, prices will naturally rise accordingly. However, because the exchange ratio between wood province and domestic and foreign goods has not changed, prices will return to normal after a certain period of time, which has been discussed in detail in the previous article. Moreover, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, subsidiary notes will inevitably be gradually absorbed through artificial and natural forces. Subsidiary notes themselves have lost their effectiveness as a measure of value, and can only be used as a medium of transaction, and even rise and fall independently from other prices, becoming a type of valuable securities, so how can they be enough to control the level of prices. As for after all the subsidiary notes are withdrawn, the silver dollars (referring to silver coins) will be fundamentally eliminated except as temporary subsidiary currency, and will no longer be an obstacle to currency unification. Therefore, although the ratio of adding 6% is set to withdraw subsidiary notes, it is actually not related to prices, that is, it is not related to people's lives. Within one or two months after the reform, if there is no standard for prices, then I think it is not difficult to remedy it. We can refer to the average price of Guangzhou in the six months before November last year, and convert it into national currency using the average ratio of silver dollars and national currency during those six months. We can also set a maximum limit based on the prices of major cities in the country in the recent period, and not allow prices on the market to be excessively raised. Soon, the use of the new currency in the province will be common, and trade with other provinces will be smooth, and then prices will inevitably return to normal.</p>
<p>(5) Finance According to investigations, the total annual revenue from national and local taxes in Guangdong Province is more than 50 million yuan. After prohibiting gambling and abolishing miscellaneous taxes, the annual revenue is 70 to 80 million yuan. Except for a small portion of which was originally based on silver dollars, the rest are received in silver dollars. During the transition period of this reform, those that are based on silver dollars will still be received and paid in subsidiary notes as usual; those that are based on silver dollars, if there is no silver dollar legal tender, will be allowed to be converted into silver dollars at the market price of the day; this method is originally to take care of reality and cater to public opinion, and is naturally appropriate. However, after the reform, in order to promote the implementation of legal tender, I think that the government should use national currency for all receipts and payments. Those that are based on national currency will naturally not be a problem. Those that are based on silver dollars should allow those who hold one yuan of national currency to pay taxes of 1.6 yuan in subsidiary notes within the period before the subsidiary notes are eliminated, in order to show fairness. Although the government will inevitably lose 10% in terms of tax revenue, this loss is very temporary. Once all the subsidiary notes are withdrawn (a period of one year or years can be set to withdraw all of them), the government will then consider the situation and set another conversion rate between silver dollars and national currency (this conversion rate is different from the conversion rate of subsidiary notes and can be set at around adding 44%) as the conversion standard. After the ratio is set, all amounts that are based on silver dollars, unless there is a contractual relationship previously set, can be converted into national currency, regardless of public or private receipts and payments. (Those with contractual relationships can be handled according to the legal tender implementation method described below.) In this way, the government's losses will be very temporary, and the losses will not be very large. Legal tender can also be promoted as a result. Moreover, the finances of Guangdong Province are fundamentally chaotic. During this transition period, the central government must provide subsidies. Although the government cannot but make some sacrifices, it can unify the currency system, stabilize finance, and increase tax revenue in the short term. This is also a good plan. On the other hand, if we only consider the current reduction in tax revenue and set a ratio of adding 5% or adding 3% to exchange subsidiary notes, it will not only put too much burden on the central government, but also will not be a blessing for the general public of Guangdong. Its disadvantages can be found in the opposite of the foreign trade and remittances from overseas Chinese described above. Some say that the ratio of national currency to Guangdong currency has been changed repeatedly, which may not be trusted by the people of Guangdong. They do not know that the ratio of adding 6% is only the ratio of exchanging subsidiary notes for legal tender, not the ratio of legal tender to silver dollars. Since the excessive issuance of subsidiary notes from November to June of this year, it has lost its position representing silver dollars. Although it can be used as a medium of transaction, it cannot be used as a criterion for measuring value. In the future, the government must not reduce its income to the extent of the depreciation of subsidiary notes due to short-term changes and the chaotic orders of the previous authorities (assuming that the central government does not maintain the subsidiary notes issued by Guangdong Province in the past, its depreciation may be as low as about 50%). The reason is very clear.</p>
<p>(6) Industry If this reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province is carried out smoothly, making the currency system unified, then prices in Guangdong Province will gradually stabilize, and foreign exchange will also tend to be stable. Investors will naturally be enthusiastic, financial activities will develop, and industry will inevitably become more developed. This has been discussed in the previous article. However, how the level of the conversion rate affects the industry must also be explained. According to the author's opinion, if the new currency system is implemented smoothly, making the price of subsidiary notes a type of valuable security other than currency, rising and falling independently from other prices, it will not have much impact on Guangdong Province's industry and commerce. However, in the one or two months after the implementation of the new currency system, the devaluation of subsidiary notes and the low exchange rate will naturally stimulate the development of industry and benefit the export of Guangdong Province's original industrial products. However, after a certain period of time, due to the unification of the currency system, domestic prices will tend to be stable, and this benefit will gradually disappear. At that time, the prosperity and decline of industry, in addition to the special reasons of the province, will naturally be transferred to the national economic policy. Some say that our country's production industry is still immature, and many emerging industries need to import foreign machinery and raw materials, and Guangdong Province is no exception. Therefore, if the conversion rate of this reform is too high, the production cost will also be high, and it cannot compete with imported goods. They do not know that if the ratio is high, although the price of foreign machinery is expensive, the price of imported goods will also rise at the same time. The way is not only can not hinder the export (because this kind of emerging industry, its products are expensive in the domestic market, but there is no change in foreign countries), and the other way can slightly suppress the dumping of foreign goods, it is beneficial and harmless. This is the third reason why the value of subsidiary notes should be suppressed.</p>
<p>To sum up, the ratio of adding 6% that Jin advocated has no impact on prices and property income; it is beneficial to foreign trade, remittances from overseas Chinese, capital activities, and industry; it can also find ways to avoid the loss of tax revenue in the future; and its greatest advantage lies in taking care of reality and facilitating the implementation of legal tender. The losses suffered by the people of Guangdong (only subsidiary note holders) are limited, and the government's burden is very light (please refer to the previous article). It is a win-win solution. On the other hand, if a ratio of adding 5% or adding 3% is set to exchange subsidiary notes, although the current tax revenue will not be reduced, the burden on the central government will be too heavy, the trade surplus will inevitably increase, remittances from overseas Chinese will be stagnant, capital will escape, credit will be tightened, and all kinds of disadvantages will emerge one after another. The harm is unspeakable.</p>
<p>(3) Legal Tender Implementation Methods</p>
<p>Based on my proposed plan, referring to the central government's intentions, and making slight revisions to the previous article, the following methods are proposed for the implementation of legal tender in Guangdong Province:</p>
<p>(1) According to the order to reform the currency system promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on November 3, 1935, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender. The silver subsidiary notes (including municipal notes) issued by the two provincial and municipal banks in Guangdong Province, except for paying taxes, are still allowed to be used as usual for all receipts and payments, but only for a limited period of years.</p>
<p>(2) All government receipts and payments are limited to the central government's legal tender. People who pay taxes can use one yuan of legal tender to pay 1.6 yuan of silver dollars, but only for a period of years, and the ratio will be determined separately after the expiration.</p>
<p>(3) All silver shops, shops, and other public and private institutions or individuals who hold the above-mentioned silver notes are allowed to exchange the central government's legal tender at the ratio of 1.6 yuan of subsidiary notes for one yuan of central government's legal tender, and can go to the Guangdong Branch of the Central Bank to exchange legal tender without limit. After that, all receipts and payments, except for legal tender and subsidiary notes, shall not be made with foreign currency or cash; violators will be confiscated in full.</p>
<p>(4) Contracts established in the old unit of silver dollars (also known as Guangdong silver coins) or subsidiary notes (also known as Guangdong legal tender) should be converted into national currency according to the originally set amount, according to the ratio of silver dollars or subsidiary notes to national currency on the day the contract was established. On the due date, all payments shall be settled in the central government's legal tender. If the payment stipulated in the contract is calculated on a periodic basis, the conversion rate on the date the contract was originally established shall be used for settlement during the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned conversion rate shall not exceed adding 6% or be less than adding 3%, which shall be investigated and verified by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance and announced separately. (Author's note: The announcement of this conversion rate can be from 1926 to the day before the implementation date of this law. If the price does not change much in a year or month, the average conversion rate of that year or month shall be used as the conversion rate for the whole year or whole month to avoid trouble. If the change is very large, the daily conversion rate shall be announced. As for those before 1926, a unified and uniform ratio can be used.)</p>
<p>The parties who established the contract can still settle payments in subsidiary notes if both parties agree.</p>
<p>(5) The order to reform the currency system promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on November 3, 1935 shall apply to all except as otherwise provided in this law.</p>
<p>(4) Explanation of Silver Two and Paper Six</p>
<p>The previous article advocated the second step of the reform plan, continuing to issue 30 million yuan of silver dollar legal tender to purchase silver from the public at the ratio of adding two; that is, one yuan of legal tender exchanges for 1.2 yuan of silver coins. However, it may be thought that the ratio of national currency to Guangdong currency set in my reform plan is sometimes adding six and sometimes adding two (referred to as silver two and paper six), which is inevitably contradictory. They do not know that the status of subsidiary notes cannot represent silver dollars, as mentioned above, and its price cannot be compared with cash silver. The reason is also clear. Today, when the system of managing currency is being implemented, the central government's legal tender has become inconvertible paper money. Therefore, the price of currency should not focus on the color of the currency or its cash reserves. The author has also considered this, but in today's China, where the credit economy is not yet fully developed, the psychology of the general public in society still focuses on the amount of cash reserves, which has a great relationship with the credit of the currency. The Ministry of Finance's declaration in June of this year also saw this, and it was a representation of consolidating the currency system and stabilizing finance. If the price of subsidiary notes in Guangdong Province is really determined by the amount of its reserves, then the actual price is only equal to about 43% of the original price, that is, one yuan of subsidiary notes is equal to 36 cents of legal tender (see the previous article); now it is converted at the ratio of adding six, that is, one yuan of subsidiary notes is equal to 63 cents of legal tender, which is 75% higher than the original price (the calculation formula has been seen in the previous article). It can be seen that the ratio of adding six is not entirely focused on the amount of its reserves, but is actually a way to comprehensively consider all aspects. As for one yuan of legal tender exchanging for 1.2 yuan of silver coins, the reason is nothing more than the two points mentioned in the previous article: one is to compare with the Shanghai market price, and the other is to make the degree of the price drop of silver coins and subsidiary notes mutually adapted. Now let's prove it with an arithmetic formula as follows:</p>
<p>Based on this, one yuan of subsidiary notes is only worth 75 cents of silver coins, that is, the price of subsidiary notes has fallen to 75% of the original price, not depreciated by 10%. They do not know that since Guangdong Province promulgated the order to centralize silver, 1.2 yuan of subsidiary notes have been used to purchase one yuan of silver coins. At that time, the price of subsidiary notes had already fallen to 10/12. Now, dividing 75 cents by 10/12, the result is still 90 cents.</p>
<p>That is, the price of subsidiary notes has actually only depreciated by 10%, which is no different from the result obtained from the two formulas calculated in the previous article. It can be seen that the ratio of silver two and paper six has a deep meaning in it.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>To sum up my reform plan, on the one hand, it is based on the two major principles of safeguarding the people's legal rights and reducing the government's burden; and on the other hand, it considers the impact on foreign trade, remittances from overseas Chinese, property income, and prices, industry, and finance, as the basis for decision-making. Finally, based on legal principles and taking into account local public opinion, the methods for implementing legal tender are determined. And its focus is especially on clarifying the status of Guangdong currency, explaining that subsidiary notes are not enough to represent silver dollars, and the ratio of adding six is only the ratio of exchanging subsidiary notes for legal tender, not the ratio of legal tender to silver dollars. It is advocated that a period of one year or two years should be set first to completely eliminate subsidiary notes, and then gradually abolish the silver dollar unit, which can not only avoid excessive burden on the central government, but also take into account the general welfare of the people of Guangdong. Although it is not a perfect solution, it is also a stable strategy. However, since this is a major reform plan, all implementation steps and practical methods must be carefully studied by the government and the people of the country. This article does not dwell on the issuance of new currency and the raising of public debt. However, with regard to the conversion rate, I think that the central government's decision to set the highest ratio at adding five, out of consideration for the suffering of the people of Guangdong, is already a special accommodation. If it is set at adding three or adding two and a half, the harm will be great, and I cannot agree. And my personal opinion is that the ratio should be determined separately according to the nature of Guangdong currency, with silver (referring to silver coins) adding two, silver dollars (the silver dollar mentioned here is not a kind of real object, it is used to represent the currency unit originally used in Guangdong Province, that is, the silver dollar standard referred to in Guangdong) adding 44, and subsidiary notes adding six, which is more appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Securities The Bond Market Was Extremely Stable Last Week, With Only Four or Five Horns of Difference Throughout the Week <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Last week (August 24th to 29th), the Chinese Securities Exchange saw extremely stable market prices throughout the week. Although it was the last day of August, prices did not fluctuate much. The October market began, and although all issues were opened, there was not much difference. A riot occurred in Chengdu, but the market price of public bonds still changed little. Although the Guangxi situation remains unresolved, market prices also saw little fluctuation. The bullish trend is so firm for two reasons: commercial depression and abundant floating capital. Apart from a portion being used to evade foreign exchange controls, public bonds have become a relatively good investment for the middle class. According to some, seeing the bond market as easier to rise than fall, and with the closure of spot commodity investments, most have gone long. Therefore, unless there are major changes in the environment, the future market price will not change much. Looking back at last week, Monday was the last day for August futures. Although there was some squeeze, it was very limited, with market prices fluctuating between three and five. On Monday, only September forward months were traded, and trading was very sluggish, with market prices slightly better by two horns. On Wednesday, October futures started trading. A riot occurred in Chengdu, but due to the bullish firmness, the price only dropped by a small horn. Thursday was Confucius' birthday, and the market was closed. Friday was the delivery day for August futures, and the market was closed. On Saturday, there were rumors of clashes between the Guangxi army near Lingshan. At the same time, the situation in Sichuan remained unchanged. However, the market price only slightly dropped by one or two horns. The future trend is still being maintained. The week's market price ended with a mere three to five horns of difference. The total transaction volume was 23.16 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan).</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton U.S. Cotton Saw New Low Prices, Industry Limited Purchases Resulted in Stable Closing, Indian Cotton Market Price Fell Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the U.S. cotton market opened, reports indicated rain in Oklahoma and northwestern Texas. News from Liverpool was unfavorable. Cotton farmers actively hedged, and Liverpool and New Orleans sold. Brokers liquidated their long positions, and prices for all months fell by three to five points. However, when the market price fell to a new low, industry limited purchases were very strong. Some Japanese firms also purchased, causing the market to stabilize. Before there is progress in the weather, buyers are hesitant to purchase, and the closing was stable. Spot prices fell by eight points, futures fell by five to eight points. British cotton spot prices fell by nine points, futures fell by five to eight points. Indian cotton retail investors sold, and market conditions were sluggish. The amount sold by futures traders was absorbed by cotton merchants through spread trading. The price of Pingor fell by 1.75 rupees, and Omra and White Raw Cotton fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 29th):</p>
<p>Pingor 153.25, down 1.75, 17.9</p>
<p>Omra 187.00, down 2.25, 33.30</p>
<p>White Raw Cotton 208.75, down 2.25, 37.50</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 31st is: White Raw Cotton at 209 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; Omra at 188.5 rupees, the same as the previous day; Pingor at 153.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees.</p>

<p>Grains River Rice Market Showed Little Difference</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total source of goods from various gangs only reached the 12th and 13th, with a total of 2,400 to 2,500 piculs. However, as retail sales were sluggish, only the Qingdao gang purchased over 200 packages. Therefore, although the market relied on scarcity to remain stable, the price of thick and thin japonica rice in the central market saw a slight depreciation. Duyang Superior Rice remained flat, with no decline in price. Dongxin arrived with a total of 700 to 800 piculs, but due to sluggish sales, the price fell by one foot. There was no difference in price for new superior rice.</p>

However, white japonica new guest superior rice slightly moved. The market price for high-quality white japonica was slightly higher by three to five points, and the price for medium-quality rice was slightly lower by nearly one corner. The price for Bian Yuan thin rice Yangshe Pier was weak by several points.

<p>Looking into the distance, Elder Sister is coming from that side, holding red embroidered shoes in her hand. I asked Elder Sister how much they cost? We only sell fresh flowers, not shoes, we keep the embroidered shoes as a signboard.</p>
<p>The green tea trees are short and can't be climbed. I lean on the tea trees and sigh. We pick tea all day long and fry tea all night long until the fifth watch. How can we have time for idle talk?</p>
<h3 id="e182">Drinking Tea <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>An English doctor advocates drinking a cup of mild, hot tea before breakfast every day, saying it has great benefits for both body and mind. He said: "A writer attributed his success to a cup of tea before breakfast. Many dieticians also approve of this habit because drinking a cup of mild tea before breakfast can not only stimulate the abdominal organs, but also make the mind clearer. However, people with weak stomachs or chronic indigestion should not have this habit, because they should absolutely not drink tea. If you put a set of alcohol stoves and a teapot on the table next to your bed, you can heat a cup of tea for yourself after getting up.</p>
<p>"Chinese tea is better than Indian tea because Chinese tea is not as strong as Indian tea. The tea we drink is best to be very mild and without milk. If you imitate the Russian style and add a thin slice of lemon to the tea, that's fine. Tea is not suitable for breakfast, and it is even more unsuitable to drink tea when eating meat at every meal. Meat and tea together are not good and are one of the main causes of indigestion. However, few people pay attention to this, and they are often seen drinking tea while eating rich dishes.</p>
<p>"Drinking a cup of tea in the afternoon is also very beneficial, but it should not be eaten with many meat sandwiches or pastries. The tea we drink should be hot, because tea contains tannin, which is an astringent acid that has the greatest effect when cold. There is no reason to drink tea before bed, because tea is a powerful stimulant. A person who drinks tea before going to bed is often awake and unable to fall asleep. Drinking a cup of hot water at this time can help digestion.</p>
<p>"Using tea as a mouthwash is the best thing to try. Natives in places like Ceylon and India where tea trees are planted not only drink a lot of tea, but also use cold tea leaves to clean their teeth. The acid contained in tea leaves can strengthen the gums and protect teeth.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Biluochun <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Biluochun, everyone knows it is a precious tea produced in Dongting East Mountain, which can be called famous at home and abroad. However, the output is not large, and when it is on the market, it is all bought by several so-called "outgoing households." They use it as a gift to give away, or relatives from afar entrust them to collect it on their behalf. The Biluochun sold in tea shops on the market, in the eyes of us Dongshan people, can be said that eight or nine out of ten are other types of tea disguised as Biluochun.</p>
<p>The preciousness of Biluochun is due to its curved shape, as thin as a needle tip, and with a layer of white fluff. When brewed, it is emerald green and fragrant. After drinking, it has a lingering taste, like tasting olives, first astringent and then sweet, sinking to the bottom of the cup, one bud and one leaf, each root just like picking it from the tree.</p>
<p>The method of making this tea is different from other places. It uses a pot for cooking rice. When making it, first heat the pot with a raging fire, and then "撲靑" (pu qing). (It is said that the Qian Zi should be heated as hot as possible when pu qing, the layer of white fluff on the tea leaves is entirely related to the temperature of the pot when pu qing.) Quickly move your hands up and down when placing the tea into the pot, when the tea leaves gradually show signs of moisture, the fire in the stove is temporarily stopped slowly. At this time, rub it with both palms, rub it into a ball and then scatter it, and continue until the pot temperature is low, then add firewood to the stove again. In this way, one pot must go through fifty to sixty times of rubbing and adding firewood. Only the methods of adding firewood and rubbing can successfully produce a few taels of Biluochun. In short, Dongting's Biluochun completely relies on slow, even fire and the technique of rubbing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our Dongshan tea trees are not planted in large quantities, they are only a by-product of the peasants. Some are wild in the mountains, and some use the empty land next to the orchards to plant a few trees. Except for the first batch of tea sold, the rest of the tea picked is kept for their own drinks.</p>

<p>— Zhong Yue</p>
<p>People who have lived in the city for a long time can no longer imagine such a leisure place in the countryside - the teahouse.</p>
<p>As long as it is a slightly densely populated village, you can find a teahouse, two or even six or seven. These teahouses are narrow and the tables and chairs are old and dilapidated. The houses are probably two bays, the rear eaves of the first bay are higher so that sunlight can enter. It is connected to the first bay of the house and there is no patio in the middle. In the inner room of the first bay, there is a large coal stove. On the clean counter side by side, there are tea pots, tea cups and other sundries. Opposite the coal stove, there is a small tank for urination.</p>
<p>(Because tea drinkers drink as much tea as possible, there is also a considerable amount of urination) A dozen or so old square tables and long benches are placed in the outer room and the inner room, so the equipment of the village teahouse is complete.</p>
<p>Every day at seven or six o'clock in the morning, Lao Dian, who is also the tea house keeper, gets up busily, opens the door, pulls the coal stove, and smoke and coal ash suddenly fill the whole house, making people unable to breathe. Then the tea customers come slowly, find a seat with sleepy eyes, the tea house keeper wipes the tables and benches with a dark rag, and then makes tea. A basin and towel for spreading trachoma is attached. The tea customers wipe their faces very seriously and use the towel as a toothbrush. As soon as the tea is poured, you can see a lot of sediment. The cleanliness of the water and the quality of the tea leaves can be seen. Some tea customers bring their own teapots to the teahouse. Does he pay attention to hygiene? (Why doesn't he bring a tea cup?) No, because when he leaves, he can ask the waiter to pour a pot of boiling tea without extra charge and take it back for his wife and children to enjoy. More and more tea customers are coming, and the teahouse suddenly becomes active. The villagers' interest in playing mahjong is no less than that of people in the city. Although they are illiterate, they know all the numbers from one wan to ten wan, east, south, west, and north, without any error. The four sides of the table are surrounded by people watching. For a while, the sound of crackling and noise is endless. There are also several people sitting around a table, raising their voices and talking non-stop. This is what is called "eating jiang tea". Villagers have a temper. Whenever there is a dispute, they often go to the teahouse to judge. If they disagree, they put on a full martial arts performance, slapping the table, hitting the bench, throwing the pot and throwing the cup. The war will never stop without someone mediating. Therefore, the tables, benches, pots and cups in the teahouse are missing corners, lame feet, and dilapidated. This is the reason!</p>
<p>At noon, the tea customers all disperse in a rush.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Story of Savings <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Saving is a virtue, which is generally recognized by the public, because no matter who, there will always be times when they encounter urgent needs. This is certainly not a problem for the wealthy, but in today's society, most people are economically disadvantaged, or make a living by working. Then, when they encounter urgent needs, they only have the method of borrowing from others, but whether they can borrow from others is uncertain. Only saving can solve this difficult problem. In the past, savings were made by taking silver or silver dollars, hiding them at home, or burying them underground, which was very dangerous or inconvenient. Now it is better, all banks have a savings department. Each person takes out a portion of their income and considers it as savings, and can send the money to the bank for deposit, but they must also deposit it in a reliable bank to avoid losses. Now I will write a short story about savings below to gain a smile.</p>
<p>In the past, there was someone named Jia, who was poor but liked to drink alcohol. He indulged in wine all day long. When he got money, he bought alcohol at the wine shop, and even if he had no money in his pocket, he would ask for credit from the wine shops. Therefore, every year during festivals, the wine bills from the wine shops were difficult to pay. Jia's wife repeatedly advised him not to listen and was extremely resentful. Later, she came up with a plan to limit Jia to only drink alcohol at home and to have her personally pay the money to buy it. Jia reluctantly agreed. From then on, every time Jia's wife went to buy alcohol, she would secretly take out some of the money and save it privately. Over time, small amounts accumulated into a large amount, but Jia did not know the mystery in this. At the end of the year, the wine shops came one after another to demand the old wine debts. Jia could not cope and was about to run away to avoid debts. Jia's wife said: There is savings money in the corner of the bed, quickly hand it over! As a result, after paying off the debt, there was still money left. Jia asked where the savings money came from? Jia's wife told him the reason, and he was deeply impressed by his wife's savings plan, which could relieve the pain of debt, and his affection for her increased a lot.</p>
<p>Although the above story is not very important, it can be known that the necessity of saving is something everyone should follow.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: Jinxi Words Come Again, Drawing Emerald Leaves, Bridal Gown Surprises, Tears Wet the Crepe Gauze</p>
<p>Menglan was stunned, seeing her mother staring at her with such concentration, she suddenly smiled and said: Mom, what kind of person do you think I look like in this outfit? Madam Jiang didn't want to say that she looked like a bride, so she smiled and said: Why are you saying such silly things? No matter what clothes you wear, you are still you. Menglan shook her head and said: No, although a person's appearance will not change, if a person's clothes are very different from their usual appearance, then they will become a different person. Those who are detectives dress up as all kinds of people, farmers, merchants, and workers, just because they can change their appearance anytime and anywhere and turn into a different person. Madam Jiang said: How can you compare yourself to detectives? They know how to disguise. Menglan smiled and said: I don't care about any of these things, anyway, I feel like something in this outfit. It's very much like those mannequin models in the glass windows of Shanghai embroidery shops. As she spoke, she stood up straight, put her arms down vertically, held her face, and stood still for no less than two minutes. Madam Jiang didn't know what was going on at first, but after a while, she remembered and smiled: This, this child is naughty, take off the new clothes, don't get them dirty. Menglan twisted her body and smiled: Isn't it very much like it? Since you say so, I'll take them off. Madam Jiang sat on a chair by the window, looking at her daughter, feeling a little bored, and inadvertently pulled open the side drawer of the desk. There was still a key in the keyhole of the drawer. When Menglan saw it, she snatched it over, pushed the drawer in, and turned the key to lock it. Then she held the key in her hand, blushed, and said: Please, old lady, don't look at my drawer. Madam Jiang was stunned, looked at her and said: Why can't I look? A young lady, what else is there to hide from her mother? Menglan slowly took off her clothes, it took five minutes, and then replied, You can look at it if you want, but please don't be surprised after seeing it, it's very unlucky. As she spoke, she handed the key to Madam Jiang again, and then hid behind the lowered half of the curtain to change out of the red skirt she was wearing. Madam Jiang said: I know, there's nothing in your drawer, you're deliberately acting like this to make me angry, I'm too lazy to talk to you, the more I persuade you nicely, the more angry you get. After saying this, she automatically went out the door and downstairs. When Menglan saw her mother left, she sat alone in the tent, not moving at all, and took out an embroidered silk handkerchief from under the pillow. Because her hand touched the pillow, which aroused her thoughts of sleep, she fell on the pillow. Two hours later, Xiaolan came upstairs to invite her to go downstairs for lunch, but saw the lady's two feet sticking out from outside the tent, and she hadn't even taken off her shoes.

<p>It is a vast, rectangular room with white walls, a white ceiling, and white light globes, giving a hazy, moonlit effect, but with long rows on either side. Four-leaf electric fans whirl overhead, mixing together the chattering and laughter of the patrons. Over a hundred small square tables are occupied by leisurely urbanites. There are office workers from foreign firms, land brokers, university students, young people who love literature and art, veteran writers, engineers, daughters of noble families and socialites, famous courtesans and dancers...</p>
<p>Emerald green curtains hang by the veranda. The tablecloths on the small square tables are beige, orange-yellow, and sky blue, and some are the same emerald green as the curtains—such soft hues.</p>
<p>This is distinctly different in style and taste from the old-fashioned "lou" (tower) or "yuan" (garden) tea houses. It is filled with the dynamism of all kinds of people. There is no need to meet certain qualifications or ask about status. Just have a leisurely heart, walk in, pick a table to sit down at, casually order a pot of black tea or oolong tea from a Southern waiter, accept the cold towel taken from the refrigerator, and casually wipe your nose or dry your hands.</p>
<p>Light a pipe, roll a cigarette, strike a match, read the newspaper's supplement, silently draft ideas, inquire about the latest market prices, discuss the merits of film actors, wait for close friends… each according to their needs. White-clad waiters do not pester with overly obsequious means like in other establishments. A cup of fragrant tea, a cigarette, a plate of dim sum, will make you forget the melting asphalt road outside, and the hurried people coming and going on the road...</p>
<p>Those carrying dim sum plates are all young girls wearing lake-blue long dresses, with healthy figures, white aprons, and long, flowing ribbons on their backs, making every patron feel lighthearted. And steamed buns, Tai Chi cakes, chicken siu mai... delivered from their fair and slender hands to your table, only five cents per serving, feels extremely cheap. In this way, even someone with indigestion will gradually increase their appetite. The shiny white fruit cart, coated with chrome, rolls smoothly from one corner to another on soft rubber wheels. Pears, purple grapes, Sunkist oranges... have fresh colors. A white porcelain dish and a small silver knife with an ivory handle are handed over by a girl with a head of black curly hair, or, if she personally peels a pear for you, you will realize that loneliness is not bitter!</p>
<h3 id="e189">Four Types of Tea Houses in Guangzhou <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Chuanan</p>
<p>In the article "Tea Houses in Guangzhou" by She Li Jun published in this newspaper on the 18th, it is a pity that it was not detailed enough and also deviated slightly from the facts. Now, according to what I know, I will write it haphazardly, continuing the unfinished work like a dog's tail. Please don't ridicule me.</p>
<p>Cantonese people are addicted to tea. They feel uncomfortable if they don't visit a tea house every day. Therefore, tea houses have sprung up in response to the times, as numerous as carps crossing the river. No matter the main street or small alley, there must be three or four dotting the landscape. Their types can be divided into four: "tea houses," "tea rooms," "tea kiosks," and "tea sheds."</p>
<p>Tea houses are located in bustling main roads, with magnificent architecture, splendid decorations, exquisite tea sets, delicious dim sum, and slightly higher tea prices. Occasionally, famous female singers from Guangzhou and Hong Kong are invited to sing in rotation (such as Yue Er, Ben Yue, Hua Niang, etc. all came from these places and became famous as a result). A song sung with a clear voice entertains the guests. Front row seats cost from five jiao to one yuan per cup. Those without sufficient financial means dare not try it. The most famous tea houses are "Taoran" at Xihaokou, "Huirian" on Huiai Road, "Yuexiu" on Yuexiu Road, "Hongmian" outside Xiaobeimen, and "Yijing Erda Sanyuan" on Changdi, etc.</p>
<p>Tea rooms mostly rent upper floors to start their businesses, with elegant and clean decorations and fewer seats. Tea prices are divided into five-fen and one-jiao types. The buns and snacks made are exquisite and palatable, and the tea servants' service is also attentive. The most famous tea rooms are "Park Tea Room" in front of the park and "Mayflower" on Huiai East Road, etc. Most of the tea drinkers are from academic circles.</p>
<p>Tea kiosks are located on small roads, with small scope and simple decorations, and the tea prices are very cheap, only two fen, two fen eight, or two fen four per cup. Dim sum such as barbecued pork buns, shrimp dumplings, siu mai, fun guo, and Malay cake, etc. are only two fen per plate with two pieces. Most economical people go there. "Youzhan Tea Kiosk" on Zhonghua North Road and "Deyi Tea Kiosk" in front of the Central Memorial Hall are the outstanding ones among them.</p>
<p>Tea sheds are mostly set up in poor mountain villages and remote areas, built by the stream, with thatched roofs. A table and a few stools have a special charm. They mostly use spring water to brew tea. The spring water is sweet and refreshing, so the tea is fragrant, which is certainly not comparable to the city. Therefore, those who have lived in the city for a long time turn their eyes and mostly go to tea sheds to drink tea and talk. On holidays, they open a room to play mahjong. "Da Bao Han" and "Xiao Bao Han" outside Xiaobeimen on Baohan Road, etc., are bustling with activity and business is thriving.</p>
<p>"On the tea house, vendors are busily shuttling to sell various snacks." This is actually She Li Jun's misunderstanding. Those who come and go to deliver dim sum are not vendors. They are tea servants hired by the tea owner (tea masters) who are in charge of serving the guests. Dim sum is not sold by the tea servants themselves. The entire business is entirely operated by the tea owner. Dim sum is two pieces per plate (only chicken meat buns and century egg pastries are one piece). According to Guangzhou tea rules, dim sum can be returned. Those that have not been eaten are not counted; while Shanghai tea houses such as "Taotao" and "Xinya" calculate the original plate and cannot be returned. This is something that tea drinkers from other provinces must know.</p>

<h3 id="e190">A Comprehensive View on the Causes and Treatment of Gonorrhea <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Replenish the most important antitoxins in the body to devour gonococci and ensure that not a single one is left.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea has been regarded as difficult to treat since ancient times because its pathogens are different from other bacteria. It is not only resistant, but also easy to reproduce. As for its transmission, it initially adheres to the urethral opening after unclean sexual intercourse. Then, the person's urethral opening has white mucus and unclear secretions. After a few days, gonococci multiply from one to two, from two to four, incessantly invading the urethra, resulting in the discharge of thick, tea-green liquid, cloudy urination, stabbing pain in the penis, and inflammation symptoms on the glans and foreskin. This is anterior urethral gonorrhea; at this time, its toxins have entered the blood. If "Kelinnong" is not taken immediately to eliminate the bacteria and toxins in the blood, and the body is not supplied with antitoxins, then gonococci will spread to various parts. Not only will posterior urethral gonorrhea's prostatitis, orchitis, and cystitis follow, but also nephritis with ureteral obstruction, arthritis leading to paralysis, iritis, and conjunctivitis leading to blindness will come one after another.</p>
<p>Mon-made "Bu Nü Rong," this medicine can invigorate endocrine secretions, promote the normal development of the puberty gland, and restore the healthy function of the ovaries, achieving the effect of regulating menstruation in a short period of time after taking "Bu Nü Rong," and achieving the purpose of promoting pregnancy and childbirth. Once there was a Ms. Ma, married for eight years, never gave birth, and the couple's relationship was icy. Her husband, in the name of continuing the family line, suspected and wanted to take a concubine. Her menstruation was abnormally disordered, and the amount of blood was small and dull. This was ovarian dysfunction and ovarian follicle stimulation.</p>
<p>Discussing the internal administration of "Kelinnong" for the cause and treatment of gonorrhea, in order to replenish antitoxins in the body, readers will definitely be surprised as they have never heard of it before; and they privately think that the various drugs they have taken before have never had this effect; therefore, they secretly lament that the gonorrhea they suffer from is actually caused by inferior drugs and has become chronic! In fact, readers only know one thing, but do not know the other. When I was practicing in a famous hospital in Moscow, I had already appreciated using "Kelinnong." After checking its medicine, it was found that it was Lipoid extracted from animal and plant fats by a German named Peter, and refined with pure pigment. It is good at promoting the human body's powerful disease prevention and immunity function. Regardless of whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea, leucorrhea (women can also use "Ka Er Xue Di" as a suppository externally), as well as complications such as the various diseases mentioned above, taking it from half a dozen to ten bottles or so, there is no one who does not have a complete cure from the root, and it has no drawbacks. Therefore, it has already been popular in European and Western countries. Because medical science is not developed in our country, it has only begun to be introduced in recent years. From now on, it is no different than a lucky star descending for those in our country who suffer from gonorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Irregular Menstruation and Pregnancy Cessation <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>—Regulating Menstruation Must Come Before Promoting Pregnancy—</p>
<p>All women with healthy ovaries and sufficient ovarian follicle stimulation factors must have adjusted menstruation and have no worries about being ahead or behind. If in virginity, development is even and there is absolutely no deformity. It is very easy to conceive after marriage. Only those with incomplete development, such as thin and withered hips and breasts, sallow complexion, and loose muscles, their menstruation must be very irregular. Even after prolonged attempts at pregnancy, they still cannot conceive. In general, women with irregular menstruation and long-term infertility are very weak, such as headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, mood changes, irritability, easy crying, unpredictable mood, and leucorrhea. Finally, they become a terrible case of hysteria. It's not just about irregular menstruation and infertility.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fundamental principle of regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy must be to take Meilun's female hormone deficiency, then take "Bu Nü Rong." After four weeks, it happened to be the menstrual period again. Fortunately, the amount of blood has increased and the color is bright and vivid. Still instructed to take it without stopping. After taking it for six weeks, menstruation came on time and had a normal amount of blood. Her underdeveloped breasts have also reached a normal plump and round state, and her muscles are delicate as cream. A year later, she dreamed of bearing a child, and now her son is two years old, and the couple's love is getting closer and closer. Her husband's plan to take a concubine has long been dispelled.</p>

<p>Handling of Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are diseases that are most likely to be encountered by those with general neurasthenia. Once this disease is not cured, one loses a day of happiness. Not only that, but it also puts life in danger. The origin of these symptoms is mostly due to masturbation during adolescence or excessive early marriage and sexual activity, which first destroys the puberty gland, resulting in the loss of healthy physiological functions. The central nervous system of excitement, the central nervous system of ejaculation, all derail and are prone to excessive excitement, so it triggers at the slightest touch, with no pleasure at all. The feeling of pleasure is also reduced and gradually disappears. The spirit and body are under this double pressure, so the body is even weaker, such as headaches, insomnia, back pain, weak legs and feet, palpitations, memory loss, anemia, yellow complexion, pale lips, dull nails, etc. All kinds of symptoms arise.</p>
<p>Since these symptoms are caused by sexual neurasthenia, it is necessary to carry out active and fundamental treatment. The most appropriate treatment is to take "Bu Ti Kang" internally, supplemented by static electricity therapy, then the disease can be removed. Jiao Shitianjun, a resident of Ximai Erxi Road, was originally a brave and strong young man. Later, he was teased by his classmates in school and developed the bad habit of self-indulgence, resulting in nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. He repeatedly took tonics, but to no avail, and his body became weaker day by day. Finally, due to his lack of brain power, he was forced to drop out of school. He asked me for treatment. After examination using scientific methods, it was found that his puberty gland was very withered and there was no development in the lower part. Therefore, he was advised to take a large amount of "Bu Ti Kang" to invigorate his puberty gland and save his weakness, and take "Naisi Nocturnal Emission Pills" to treat his nocturnal emission. Then he used electrotherapy. After four or five weeks of hard treatment, the frequency of nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation was completely cured. The diseases caused by nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation were also cured. The lower part became more and more developed. An examination showed that the puberty gland was indeed healthy. He continued to study at a certain school to complete his studies.</p>
<h3 id="e193">100 Questions on Tuberculosis <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Former Professor Deng Yuanhe of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road Consultation Hours: 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>(1) Question: Please explain the definition of tuberculosis and the symptoms of the first, second, and third stages.</p>
<p>The definition of tuberculosis, in a broad sense: Any disease caused by tuberculosis bacteria can be called tuberculosis. Such as lymph node tuberculosis, spine and joint tuberculosis, and pulmonary tuberculosis. Among them, pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common, so the tuberculosis we talk about today has a narrow meaning, referring to pulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis is also referred to as lung disease.</p>
<p>Although the progress of lung disease is slow, its changes are also very rapid. Therefore, wanting to judge its severity with common sense and determine which stage it belongs to is like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword or sticking a string to tune a zither. And forcibly dividing it into a certain stage is an old saying. Therefore, today's latest scientific doctors mostly do not ask what stage the lung patient has reached, but only give him resolute and effective treatment. However, in general, the initial symptoms are reduced appetite and fatigue, which is a phenomenon of apical catarrh. The second stage includes coughing up blood, chest pain, and tidal fever. The third stage includes massive hemoptysis, high fever, emaciation, insomnia, and palpitations. And usually lung patients also have neurasthenia insomnia, and women often have irregular menstruation. According to my many years of research and the clinical experiments of world-renowned lung disease doctors, among many drugs, only Dr. Tumei's "Bu Fei Na Er" has the most obvious antibacterial and anti-tuberculosis effect. It can treat the disease if you have it, and prevent tuberculosis if you don't have it. It is indeed good at stopping bleeding, relieving cough, astringing night sweats, reducing false fever, and strengthening the stomach and body. It is best to take "Bu Fei Na Er" at the same time as the male "Bu Ti Kang" or the female "Bu Nü Rong" to nourish the brain and blood and increase physical strength, then insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, dizziness, etc. will be completely cured. And "Bu Ti Kang" is good at treating impotence, premature ejaculation, and back pain. If there is nocturnal emission, you can also take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills." "Bu Nü Rong" can also regulate menstruation and treat all menstrual diseases. If there is leucorrhea, you can also use "Ka Er Xue Di" externally as a suppository. In this way, taking care of everything, lung disease can be cured in one or two months and will not recur.</p>
<h3 id="e194">New Treatment for Leucorrhea <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Can be treated at home to avoid troubling the doctor</p>
<p>Leucorrhea is the most common disease in women, mostly caused by self-indulgence and rough sex, which abrasions the vagina, resulting in internal inflammation, swelling, and erosion, profuse white discharge, lower abdominal pain, and menstrual irregularities. It is difficult to conceive, and the love between husband and wife is from cold to rupture. Patients are often mentally depressed, ashamed to speak up, and unwilling to seek medical treatment. Their bodies are trapped, their appearances are diminishing day by day, and they are haggard.</p>
<p>According to my years of experience, leucorrhea is not a disease that women should worry about, and it is not necessarily necessary to go to the doctor's door to be cured. Because now there is a German "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablet" on the market, which has the functions of antiseptic, anti-secretion, and bactericidal. It is suitable for self-treatment at home, which can avoid the trouble of going to the doctor. The method of use is to insert one tablet of this medicine into the vagina every night before going to bed and wash it off the next morning. It has no harsh irritation and can eliminate leucorrhea within a few weeks and will not recur. However, this disease is also sometimes transmitted by the husband's gonorrhea. It is advisable to also take "Kelinnong" to remove the gonococci in the deep part. Those who have leucorrhea and irregular menstruation due to physical weakness and infertility should also purchase and take "Bu Nü Rong" at the same time to regulate menstruation, strengthen the body, and treat both the symptoms and the root cause. The effect is especially rapid, and it has been proven by many people. It is indeed the new gospel of the female world.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Autumn Cough and Phlegm <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Dean Deng Yuanhe of Shanghai South People's Hospital</p>
<p>As the seasons enter autumn, the nights are as cool as water. If you are not careful, a cold will sneak in, and a cough will occur. Coughing is a persistent disease. If the medicine is improperly treated, or inferior medicine is mistakenly taken, it will become a chronic disease. Prolonged coughs will not heal, and the lungs will be damaged, eventually leading to tuberculosis, which will be dangerous. Phlegm is the source of all diseases. Its cause is also mostly due to colds, which cause inflammation of the trachea. If the phlegm is not eradicated, the trachea will expand, becoming a sputum stench, often inducing pneumonia and sudden death. Other complications include whooping cough and asthma. "Bu Fei Na Er" is the only medicine for resolving phlegm and relieving cough. Its effect on eliminating tracheal inflammation is the most significant. Therefore, it has a good effect on all kinds of coughs. Especially, this medicine is good at removing stubborn phlegm. Therefore, all colds, children's whooping cough, asthma, prolonged cough, etc., once purchased and taken, can be completely cured in about three weeks to eight weeks.</p>

<p>The digestive organs include the oral cavity, salivary glands, stomach, and intestines, with the stomach being the main organ. Because the stomach takes in food, if the stomach is sick, then food cannot be accommodated, affecting the body's nutrition. Therefore, stomach disease will also cause other digestive organs to get sick, and stomach symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, noisy chest tightness, aversion to food, belching acid, must be accompanied by bitter mouth, bad breath, and slow intestinal peristalsis. Constipation and lots of gas. All digestive organs diseases are based on strengthening the stomach. When the root cause is treated, all diseases will be eliminated. Therefore, the main treatment is to take the German "Qiang Wei Jing." "Qiang Wei Jing" is not only good at treating the above symptoms, but also good at treating beriberi, which lacks vitamin B, because it contains a lot of vitamin B.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Self-Treatment of Masturbation Syndrome. Nocturnal Emission Disease Has Different Levels, And Naturally The Treatment Also Varies. <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Dai De</p>
<p>Clinic: Across from Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission disease is due to congenital insufficiency and weakened endocrine function. However, most of them are caused by masturbation. Therefore, nocturnal emission disease can also be included in masturbation syndrome. The symptoms of masturbation syndrome are dizziness, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, and weak thinking and judgment ability. The main symptom is nocturnal emission. Nocturnal emission also has different levels. Usually it is dream emission, gradually progressing to dreamless spermatorrhea, and further progressing to premature ejaculation. At this time, sexual neurasthenia is extremely severe, and the vas deferens is exhausted and unable to control sperm, so there is also sperm leakage, that is, after exertion or urination, sperm drips. The main treatment is to purchase and take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" at Zhongxi Drugstore.</p>
<p>However, there are many ways to treat it. In short, nocturnal emission caused by masturbation requires suppressing the brain nerves and strengthening the will, then masturbation will be stopped. Most nocturnal emission medicines can only consolidate sperm and cannot eliminate masturbation. Only "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" has the great effect of enhancing the will and stopping masturbation. Taking four or five bottles can be cured from the root, and various nocturnal emission symptoms can also be cured. If nocturnal emission is caused by excessive sexual neurasthenia, impotence and kidney deficiency, incomplete sexual development, foreskin, etc., in addition to taking "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills," you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" to invigorate the endocrine system and increase kidney development, then all diseases will be eliminated. Also, if nocturnal emission is caused by lung disease or acute gonorrhea, in addition to taking "Bu Fei Na Er" to treat the lungs or "Kelinnong" to remove gonorrhea, it is still best to take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" to consolidate the vas deferens and take "Bu Ti Kang" to invigorate the endocrine function!</p>
<h3 id="e198">Conquering Stubborn Gonorrhea <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Japanese Imperial University Medical School</p>
<p>What treatment is most effective? This is a question that has never been resolved before!</p>
<p>In the past, some people thought that gonorrhea could be cured without medicine, and some people said that gonorrhea could not be cured even with medicine. In fact, both are extreme arguments. However, the stubbornness of gonorrhea is indeed a fact. It is a mistake to not treat gonorrhea, and the reason why those who take medicine cannot be cured is because there is no specific medicine to be released to the world. However, since the German Peter devoted decades of painstaking research and invented the specific medicine "Kelinnong," gonorrhea, which was previously considered incurable, has been fundamentally overturned. Because "Kelinnong" is a preparation made by mixing yellow pigment and protein, after taking it, it can produce antitoxins in the body and play a bactericidal and anti-gonorrhea effect. This effect is systemic and not limited to the local area. Wherever there is a trace of gonococci, this bactericidal effect will be seen immediately. Therefore, it does not harm the healthy parts, and the stubborn and stubborn gonococci are all conquered and cured by "Kelinnong". However, in the past, the old method only paid attention to local transparent membrane sterilization. How do they know that gonococci are microorganisms that are good at escaping, which instead expands the disease and increases the difficulty of treatment. Therefore, it is far less rapid and complete than "Kelinnong's" encircled sterilization method.</p>
<p>However, many gonorrhea patients have already married, and one sexual intercourse can transmit gonorrhea to their wives. Often, after the wife is infected, she is unaware of it. It is not until one or two months later that leucorrhea is discovered. Therefore, even if the husband's own gonorrhea has been cured, but the wife's gonorrhea has not been eliminated, he will soon be re-infected by the husband, and all previous efforts will be wasted. For safe treatment, it is advisable to treat at the same time. If you realize that your wife already has gonorrheal leucorrhea, or uterine gonorrhea, vaginal gonorrhea, in addition to taking "Kelinnong" internally, you can also use "Ka Shi Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository to wash away the leucorrhea, which can be cured in three or four weeks. This is also an excellent treatment for conquering stubborn gonorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e199">A Noteworthy Recurrence of Gonorrhea <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Army Medical University</p>
<p>Strange! After three years of being cured of gonorrhea, it suddenly recurred after a bout of heavy drinking. Baffling.</p>
<p>Patient Qin Pingjun had suffered from gonorrhea three years prior. He claimed to have been cured, but he usually adhered to hygiene meticulously, paying attention to matters such as sexual activity, alcohol consumption, and exercise. Thus, there were no other changes, only that he faintly felt his urine was turbid when he was tired from work. Last year, Qin was invited to a friend's wedding and, thinking his old illness had not recurred for many years, he drank immoderately and returned home dead drunk. The next morning, he suddenly felt burning and stinging pain when urinating, and his urine was streaked with pus-like threads, realizing his old illness had not been eliminated and had flared up again. He took medicines for clearing turbidity and sterilizing the membrane, but they were of no avail. After three or four months of delay, it even turned into orchitis. He was then introduced by his colleague Wang Jinbao to me for treatment. In addition to ordering him to rest quietly and use a testicular support, I also administered "Clinon" to generate anti-gonorrheal sterilization within the body. The gonococci scattered everywhere could then be captured in one fell swoop and completely resolved. As a result, after three weeks of taking it, the testicular swelling and pain completely disappeared. However, his urine still felt slightly turbid. He continued taking it for about two weeks, and it finally became clear and spotless. Qin was afraid that he was not completely cured, so he separately asked other doctors to perform blood serum tests, as many as a dozen times, and there was no gonococcal reaction. Later, he also performed drastic exercises and heavy drinking and other stimulants, but there was no change in gonorrhea. Then he finally believed he was cured. According to Qin's previous illness, although he had ostensibly recovered, the gonococci were actually still hidden deep inside. Therefore, it can be proven that when his body was tired, his urine became turbid. If he still took ordinary local membrane-sterilizing drugs, it could only temporarily alleviate the symptoms and gain temporary peace. In the future, it would inevitably recur again and again. Therefore, it was difficult to get cured without taking "Clinon."</p>
<p>Readers' Corner</p>
<p>When purchasing the following specified medications, be sure to identify and buy them. Do not mistakenly purchase miscellaneous brand cheap and inferior drugs due to blindly believing in other people's words, which may endanger your life after taking them. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>Acute Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shushi: Your symptoms of swollen head, reversed foreskin, and unclear pus and blood in the urine indicate acute gonorrhea. You should ask Dr. Yao Juyan to perform "anti-gonococcal serum" and X-ray treatment. Before treatment, taking "Clinon" can also radically cure gonococci. After healing, it will not recur.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Dizziness</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Daolin: For your symptoms of nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and small external genitalia, you can take "Nes Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to astringe the spermatic duct and "Buti Kang" to restore weakness.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Zhen: For your symptoms of leukorrhea, lower abdominal swelling and pain, and delayed menstruation, you can use "Carl's Snow White" externally to treat leukorrhea and take "Bu Nv Rong" internally to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body. You can also take "Qiang Wei Jing" for poor appetite.</p>
<p>If readers have any difficult illnesses, please attach a return envelope and provide detailed information about your address and send it to Kangjian Pharmaceutical Company, 869 Wuding Road, Shanghai, and we will reply immediately.</p>

<p>A Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e200">Japan's Concern for China's Revival <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The Pacific Society held its sixth conference the other day. First, Dr. Hu Shi, the Chinese representative, gave a speech, stating that any Chinese government that is strong enough to unify the country and enhance the country's position will not be tolerated by Japan. This has almost become national policy in Japan. The Japanese representative stood up immediately to object and stated that he would answer point by point tomorrow. I think that under the current brutal situation of Japan in Guanwai and North China, it is difficult to justify that Japan does not oppose China's unification. Therefore, they had to declare in advance that they would answer point by point tomorrow, which is the same as the storytellers who sell off suspense, "Please come early tomorrow."</p>
<p>After a night of deep thought and deliberation, I think Mr. Yoshizawa must have made a magnificent speech. Sure enough, this magnificent speech was published in the newspaper the other day. The important points of his reply are about three points: (1) China and Japan are of the same race and culture, and are very concerned about China's revival, (2) Japan does not oppose China's unification, and (3) Japan opposes China's unification because China itself is not good.</p>
<p>For the first point, because China and Japan are close at hand and of the same culture and race, we are indeed grateful for Japan's concern and have benefited a lot. Not counting the past, the September 18 Incident was Japan's concern, the January 28 Incident was Japan's concern, accommodating ordinary Chinese traitors and ruffians to disrupt the political situation in North China was Japan's concern, and the "free trade" everywhere, I don't say smuggling, was Japan's concern. The construction of airfields by force and the unlimited increase of troops are all Japan's concern.</p>
<p>For the second point, he said that he does not oppose China's unification. What is the evidence? Well, he said that a few months ago, Chen Jitang of Guangdong failed and stepped down, and Guangdong and Nanjing reunited. From this point of view, Japan has never hindered China's unification. In fact, Chen Jitang's failure and stepping down were due to the Guangdong army's own realization that they were unwilling to use the same room's weapons and be exploited by the fisherman. This is something Japan could not help but really loathed to forget. Therefore, Chen Jitang's stepping down has nothing to do with Japan and is not enough to prove that Japan does not oppose China's unification. This is really the so-called scratching an itch through boots.</p>
<p>The third point is that China has repeatedly increased tariffs, violated treaty obligations to Japan, and especially disregarded the 1905 Protocol and built a parallel line to the South Manchuria Railway in Manchuria. This statement is the basis for opposing China's unification and undermining China's unification. In short, raising tariffs and reducing tariffs are the absolute freedom of independent countries and are not restricted by any country. Moreover, raising tariffs is not only aimed at Japan alone. If the tariffs of one country are raised, and all other countries are exceptions, why don't other countries come out to oppose it, but Japan uses this as an excuse to kill people? As for building a parallel line to the South Manchuria Railway, it is also absolute freedom to build China's railways on China's land. I really don't understand why this offends Japan so deeply.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshizawa also said that recalling the Washington Conference, the Nine-Power Treaty was signed to guarantee China's territorial integrity, and Japan initiated it. Whether this matter was initiated by Japan remains to be verified. Even if Japan initiated it, it is not known whether Japan has any other intentions. However, this matter should be thanked, but may I ask what country destroyed the various events that damaged China's territorial integrity after September 18? What country tore up the League of Nations? I am afraid that Mr. Yoshizawa, even with a hundred mouths, cannot explain it. Chinese compatriots are being deported back to China batch after batch, but they say that overseas Chinese in Japan are treated with courtesy everywhere. The pseudo-Manchu signboard is hung high in the eastern provinces, but they say that they are very concerned about China's revival. Alas, what is this?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Yoshizawa still has a trace of conscience, and said that we will deeply know that our actions against China are not without improprieties. Then, Mr. Yoshizawa is already aware of this. Why do you say that if the two countries want to restore proper feelings, it is best for China to change its attitude and cooperate with Japan? This statement is exactly the opposite. Assuming that the two countries want to restore proper feelings, Japan should change its attitude first and cooperate with China before there is room to restore proper feelings between the two countries. Otherwise, it will be a day that is unbearable to look back on.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Miscellaneous Autumn Talks <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Red Leaves</p>
<p>Talking about Dysentery</p>
<p>Dysentery is a type of infectious disease, divided into two types: bacterial and amebic. Patients first experience abdominal pain, followed by tenesmus, often thinking of going to the toilet, and excreting red and white pus-like substances. Their spirits are weakened, and their lives are at risk! The most effective treatment in modern times is to take the new drug "An Li Sheng" (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy). This agent has definite antiseptic and disinfectant effects. It can cure various types of dysentery, intestinal infections, and general infectious gastrointestinal diseases of unknown cause. It is worth recommending.</p>
<p>Talking about Exercise and Supplementation</p>
<p>The way to strengthen the body is to exercise appropriately to temper the physique, and also to take tonifying and nourishing agents to make the blood vigorous and nutrition sufficient. Exercise and supplementation must be equally emphasized, complementing each other, and neither can be neglected.</p>
<p>The modern tonic "Artificial Self-Blood" tonifies blood and strengthens the body, with accurate efficacy. "Wuzhou Milky White Cod Liver Oil" and "Earth Spleen Wheat Essence Cod Liver Oil" treat deficiency and strengthen the body, increasing nutrition, and are known as the three heroes of supplements. They are truly the elements of health and the shortcut to strengthening the body!</p>
<p>Talking about Women's Suffering</p>
<p>Women's menstrual periods come once a month. If they flow non-stop like dripping, or come several times a month, it is very painful. On the contrary, if the menstruation is closed, astringent, and infrequent, and they feel depressed and irritable, it is even more dangerous! Both excess and deficiency are pathological states.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy has two wonderful agents: (1) Yue Yue Hong, which can promote menstruation and invigorate blood; (2) Women's Treasure, which can nourish and regulate menstruation. Both are gynecological sacred medicines with accurate efficacy, and taking them can thoroughly relieve the pain of menstrual diseases.</p>
<p>Talking about Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>Being infected with gonorrhea and other venereal diseases causes lingering pain and endless regrets. But once infected, you should quickly seek reasonable treatment. Do not be deceived by the deception of quack doctors and the exaggerated propaganda of slippery medicines. Otherwise, one mistake will lead to another, and it will be too late to regret!</p>
<p>"Deli Ping" is the most complete modern drug for treating gonorrhea, with verified efficacy and no drawbacks. After taking it, the effects of diuresis, pain relief, sterilization, anti-inflammation, astringency, and clearing turbidity can be gradually realized, achieving a complete cure. It is the most ideal and reasonable magic medicine for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Flowers <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>I have wanted to write an article about flowers for a long time, but I have not written a single word after picking up the pen several times. Because I love flowers passionately, there were dozens of pots of flowers I planted by hand in the yard of my hometown. After I left my hometown, they all withered. When I think of writing an article about flowers, I immediately remember the unbearable death of those dozens of flowers, and finally I put down the pen.</p>
<p>After coming to Shanghai, naturally there is no opportunity to plant flowers, and the environment does not allow you to do so. As a second choice, I wanted to buy a few flowers to offer on the desk, but it seems not very possible; although those flower shops display various seasonal flowers every day, the price is really too expensive. I am almost like a tramp standing outside the glass window of a bakery, and I have to stand outside the door of an attached flower shop for a while every day. Those flowers are really too lovely.</p>
<p>The shop owner is a Western woman, so most of her customers are Westerners. There are especially many people buying flowers on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, but those are not people who love flowers. They are betting their love with their girlfriends with flowers. So the price is too expensive. That is also one of the reasons.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>On Nanjing Road, there are many little girls who specialize in selling white orchid flowers, and naturally there are also old women. Their patrons are mostly female customers. They like to stand outside department stores or silk shops, and when they see female customers coming out with goods, they always follow them closely, hoping to sell a flower or a flower ball, but those little girls are often disappointed, because those ladies have "monthly" flower sellers who deliver them to their houses every morning on a daily basis. If it is in the evening, then it is time for female customers to buy flowers, because the female customers who pass by there in the evening are said to be mostly from the game field; as for why those who go to the game field must buy a flower or a flower ball to decorate their lapels, that is a side effect of flowers, which is inconvenient to say more about.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, do those little girls only do business in the evening one day? It is definitely not the case. There are some people who spend a few copper coins and flirt with them, or even pinch their arms and grab their palms, and throw the flowers they bought on the road in the blink of an eye. That is simply a waste of natural resources, but it is also a kind of side effect of flowers.</p>
<p>I once went to Nanyang Bridge with a friend before dawn to visit the flower market. Outside the iron gate, the sidewalk and the center of the street that lead directly to the newly opened Heping Road are all flower sellers who come to the market. The flower market is centered on the Wanhualou Tea House. Everyone brews a pot of tea and waits for patrons there. Those little girls who sell white orchid flowers walk back and forth there at this time, stringing the flowers with lead wire. As for the situation of flirting and touching here and there during the sale, it is even worse than on Nanjing Road. The old women pouted and mumbled that they could not get good flowers and that business would be discounted, but that kind of vile insult could be avoided. If she had also been a flower-selling girl since she was a child, then she would have to grieve that her age was running too fast; not being able to get good flowers when buying flowers, and no one talking to her when selling flowers, this is exactly a symbol of the fate of flowers! Today, they are attached to the lapel and inserted into the vase, and tomorrow they will all be thrown into the trash can.</p>
<p>I was really happy that day. I bought a bunch of my favorite dahlias. Because dahlia is the name of one of my girlfriends, it is a pity that I failed in the love bet. I don’t know whose vase that bright dahlia is inserted into now? I hope she will always be eye-catching and lovely, and not wither like the dozens of flowers in my hometown.</p>
<p>Now I have an artificial flower inserted in the bottle on my desk, which I bought from a department store, and the flower is naturally a dahlia. Although it has been too long, the petals are full of dust, and the red color is about to turn dark yellow. However, because of my love for it, even if it turns from dark yellow to ocher, it is still a lovely dahlia; moreover, I have bought expensive flowers, and if I abandon her, that empty bottle will also lose its effect.</p>
<p>I have already written a lot, and I will leave the unfinished part to write when I have the opportunity.</p>

Looking out, it is an endless plain. Going up, up, the northwest corner gradually rises, directly adjacent to the mouth of the Yellow River. The Yellow River occupies an important position in the northern countryside. Ordinary people think that there is some "immortal energy."

<p>Farewell to Love from the Military</p>
<p>Recalling leaving the rear, forming a team, the military appearance is majestic, the military music is melodious, urging all the comrades in the army to leave their lovely hometown. In the crowds on both sides of the road, the loving parents, their tears dried up and their voices parched, the dear wife, heartbroken, mournfully, a farewell to life and death, crying sorrowfully, heroic ambitions shattered. The comrades are flustered, their solemn faces are even more tense, the hands holding the guns are also shaking randomly, and the tears are dripping down. Can the patriotic warriors be like this? How ridiculous, cowardly, hum, fools. Unexpectedly, a cry arose, my own parents and brothers are all there, and my dear wife and sisters are all there, mourning as if it were a farewell forever, crying sorrowfully with tearful voices, let me comfort them, but who knows that my lips are trembling, my stiff tongue cannot move, my throat is filled with tears, thousands of words, after all, where to start?

Whip once. Curse once. The hands are waving and the eyes are looking without stopping. But I see her, snow skin and cloud temples in a mess. Her clothes are not neat, revealing her chest.

I think you lived a humble life in a lane. Singing and playing the pipa for a living. Now I haven’t changed my usual ways. I’m afraid that the fox’s tail will still be revealed. I thought you disguised yourself as a scholar, and became a dignified female student. You came here to enjoy glory and wealth, and have a happy heart with beautiful clothes and jade food.

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Boudoir Resentment" (Mimi's inaugural issue)</p>
<p>The autumn scenery is fading, and winter has arrived. Crows crow in groups in the cold wind. Vermilion spits out sunshine. The moonlight is faint, and the night fog is thick. The beauty sits alone, lost in thought. Facing the lonely lamp, she doesn't realize that her chest is stained with tears. Unfortunately, her uncle and mother died one after another. She is lonely and has few younger brothers. Drifting aimlessly, she is寄 in another village. She has spent several winters in misery. But she was promised marriage by her aunt.</p>

<p>Saying that the gentleman is a romantic and noble official. Since the year of the candlelight wedding. Who knows that the first wife has a different temper. She is ignorant, unknowing, and unkind. How can they have a happy heart with zithers singing in harmony. There has never been a single word of intimacy. The couple seems to have met strangers. I hate that he often goes to the brothels and spends the night. I hate that his strange habits are different from others. It is hateful that the old man under the moon has no discernment. It is a great pity to have the wrong red thread. I believe a sentence of the ancients. Beautiful women have a thin life since ancient times. Several times I think of things that are depressing. I will be lonely in my boudoir for the rest of my life. It is pitiful that I am the daughter of the former rich family. How can I learn to be the same as civilized women. The only thing to dispel is the music. The jade flute is hard to blow with thousands of heavy sorrow. How sad is the splendor years, lonely sleeping. Half of the brocade quilt, half of the bed is empty. I feel a little tired and fall into a dream. But I was called by the magpies under the eaves calling in the west wind. I am infinitely desolate, suing the sky.</p>

<p>"Comedy writer" Huang Jiamo's other new work after "Incarnation Girl", "Xilimen", is now being filmed by Yihua Company, directed by Yue Feng. The script is Huang's proud work last year, which was highly praised by the producer (editor's note: that is, Yihua). Director Yue Feng and all the actors were very excited when working. The film has great and magnificent scenes, novel and compact plots, and is full of fun. It is unprecedented. It is not only a realistic portrayal of Chinese folk customs, but also a vivid form of typical rural figures. Everyone who has read the script of the film can't help but laugh and applaud. Director Yue Feng's technique is particularly bright and brisk, lively and interesting. The plot of the film is listed below to see a glimpse:</p>
<p>Village girl's beauty, playboy's admiration.</p>
<p>Marriage proposal competition, matchmakers compete.</p>
<p>Family education is wrong, the father indulges the son.</p>
<p>Beside the festival and filial piety archway, the widow is flirtatious.</p>
<p>Stopping the sedan chair to snatch the bride, getting rid of the golden cicada.</p>
<p>Fat pigs accompany the dowry, and daughters are in the same car.</p>
<p>Secretly crossing Chencang, please enter the urn.</p>
<p>The sins are deep, and He Yan shows filial piety.</p>

<p>On the stage –</p>
<p>Audiences are captivated, adore, and go crazy for your talent and beauty!</p>
<p>But who knows how miserable your real life is?</p>
<p>You cannot refuse the powerful figures offering wine and passing cups,</p>
<p>And your good-for-nothing husband constantly subjects you to fists and kicks,</p>
<p>Because you cannot satisfy his exploitative desires!</p>
<p>And the burdens of the family are added to your shoulders,</p>
<p>You don't resist,</p>
<p>You are also powerless to resist,</p>
<p>Because the forces of feudalism are surging high,</p>
<p>Oh, you weak woman;</p>
<p>Your whole life is buried under these feudal shackles!</p>
<p>Bearing tears of pain,</p>
<p>Drinking the bitter wine of life,</p>
<p>But you are also filled with bright hope,</p>
<p>Entrusting your life to your son,</p>
<p>However, your hope is soon extinguished,</p>
<p>Fate has carved another deep wound in your heart,</p>
<p>"Oh! It's over, my son is over, I'm over, everything is over,"</p>
<p>You are as grieved as if you have gone mad,</p>
<p>But the gluttonous kiss of the violent man is still not satisfied,</p>
<p>And sends his henchmen to force you to the military governor's mansion,</p>
<p>You are determined to die,</p>
<p>The banquet is filled with such tragic laughter and scolding,</p>
<p>And you even draw out a white blade to stab the violent man in the chest,</p>
<p>But you are, after all, a weak animal,</p>
<p>And are soon imprisoned in a high wall where the sun never shines,</p>
<p>Although you finally regained your freedom later,</p>
<p>You are already homeless,</p>
<p>Wandering in the vast sea of people,</p>
<p>Traveling a long and arduous journey,</p>
<p>Until you encounter your son whom you haven't seen for ten years,</p>
<p>A hint of a smile finally unfolds on your melancholic face!</p>
