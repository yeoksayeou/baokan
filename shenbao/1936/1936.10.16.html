<p>— 宜譯</p>
<p>蘇聯著名政論家康脫洛微支（Kantorvich）年前出版了一部關於遠東問題的權威著作，書名呌「美國在列强為中國的鬥爭裏」。（America　in　the　Struggle　for　China）他所根據的參考資料非常廣博。除了日報上雜誌上關於美國跟遠束關係的歷來的記載以外，他還從沙皇政府所遺留的從未發表的檔案上，參考過不少的資料。這部書在結未幾章就現代的遠東國際局勢分析了一番。出版以後，作者又在蘇聯各刊物上陸續發表了幾篇論文，探討這方面的局勢。美國作家哈萊忒·摩耳（Harriet　Moore）把　脫洛微支所作的這項研究歸納起來，寫成了一篇札記，登載在太平洋事情季刊九月號。那位蘇聯學者對於當今的遠東局勢作着怎樣的分析，我們從這里可以知道大槪了。現在就把摩爾的札記譯出如下：</p>
<p>現今太平洋的情勢受着三角式的日英美三强的政策的支配。其他國家雖也有牽述着的，可是他們的影響不是比較的不重要，就是有着固定的性質，可以當作方程式上的恒數看。日大用了軍事的和經濟的手段向外擴張的政策也一樣是固定的，然而這種擴　的方向和速度却因其他兩强的行動不能不受到影響。因此太平洋的情勢實際上是英美政策的變化所决定的。英美政策的基本目的並不變動。兩國都要保護他們現在的遠束利益，連那些在中國的利益在內，兩國都要在將來遠東的商業和投資上所可取得的優先權中間，至少為自國確定相當的一份：然而為要達到這等目標所採取的策略，以及從駐防軍所發生的壓力郤是變動的。</p>
<p>在一九三一——三二年，日本進兵滿洲的初期，英美的有效的壓力减縮到差不多沒有了。在華盛頓會議壓抑過日本的英美結合已經解體了。世界的經濟恐慌，英國的廢除金本位和戰債問題加深了兩國的矛盾，妨碍着遠東前綫上兩國的合作。英國對於勁敵的日本，並不害怕得怎麼厲害。商業競爭還是限於少數的工業。英國的反蘇聯戚情很强烈，指望着日本的擴張可以當作削弱蘇聯的手段，還可以用作防禦中國「革命」的堡壘。太平洋的英屬殖民地大都反對着反日行動，因為他們對日的貿易正在增進，而他們在中國的利益是微小的；如果日本只是向北力移動着，他們就不至於從日本侵略的進展遇到直接的危險。因此，英國所行使的政策就是利用了日本的行動，來推進它自己的反蘇聯和反美的企圖。英國玩着這麽一套把戲：把日本跟美國放在天平秤上，看誰輕誰重。</p>
<p>同時，美國行使着它的傳統的方策；竭力要用「道德的壓力」來保護自己。史汀生的「不承認」主義的發揮，對於日本的行為的抗議，在李　調査團，及其後來口頭的反對日本的擴張的表示上，跟國聯的合作：這些就是美國的行動的限度。美國也陷進了經濟恐慌，把注意力集中在那上頭。它的軍備很疏懈，因了胡佛的經濟計畫，連改良的步驟也無法着手。美國片面的道德的壓力顯然是沒有什麽效力，只不過獲得了國際上對於日本新地位的不承認，使問題延宕下去。英國不肯帮忙，美國沒有承認蘇聯，中國呢因為美國還一味希望着南京着力的緣故，沒有預備好怎樣有效的合作。因此美國徒然捱受了一番因「紙上」反對日本而惹起的煩悶，收不到什麽功效。</p>
<p>在接着的兩年中間，跟着世事的變化，兩國的地位轉移了。英國對於日本的恐懼心滋長起來。商業戰爭擴展到新的市塲和新的商品門類。上海的「間奏曲」，由於中英美暫時聯合的壓力，雖是日本的失敗，郤也使英國及其殖民地所抱的，以為日本的企圖只着眼於華北這一種幻想消除了。華盛頓條約的廢止使全世界的軍備競爭重復進行着。由於德國在各方面所表現的加深的侵略性，和意大利在阿比西尼亞的冒險，歐洲局勢更加緊張了。蘇聯的增長的力量漸漸地把英國的反蘇聯　子推到幕後去。蘇聯是在歐洲的安定方面一個偉大的潛勢力，英國非拉攏它不可，這成為顯明的情勢了。而且因為蘇聯强盛起來的緣故，在最近的將來，日本有把握地進攻蘇聯的可能性也消减下去。於是日本轉到南方，向英國的眞正利益進犯了。</p>

<h3 id="c50">中英信用借欵和利用外資 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>我們還記得六月二十一日。英國駐華經濟使節李滋羅斯爵士在上海招待記者時說。英國的製造商和出口商亟應與中國各銀行及政府當局治商。多多以信用投資援助中國進行建設計劃。使中國日趨繁榮。則受益者不僅一個英國。世界各國都有好處。李氏回國以後。就本着這個信念。在英國朝野間多方活動。經數月的努力。直到最近中英信用放欵恊定方才成立。由英國以信用放欵一千萬鎊貸給中國。中國得在英政府的擔保之下。購辦大批英貨。其辦法和本年七月間英國以信用放欵一千萬鎊貸給蘇俄時所訂的相同。現在協定內容還未發表。但七月間成立的英俄商業借欵協定內容的要點是。期限十年。年利五釐半。由蘇俄發行蹬券。在倫敦市塲流通。擔保於一定期內償還貸欵。以此例彼。是不難窺見協定的輪廓的。</p>
<p>國際間的信用借欵是很尋常的事情。這次借欵的數目又不鉅大。但其醞釀的經過。却巳有一年多了。去年三月。英國政府卽提議根據九國公約及一九二〇年的國際銀團協定。由各國集合力最貸欵給中國。援助建設。因日本反對而未進行。四月。英國又提議在南京召開討論中國幣制的會議。邀請日美法比諸國銀行代表參加。又因日本不同意而未見實現。後來英國派李滋羅斯爵士來華。調查中國經濟情形。在這期內李氏曾兩度去日。向日本當局提議共同對華投資。但仍未為日本所接受。英國的建議。旣遭日本再三拒絕。它自然要單獨對華投資。以貫澈它的信念了。</p>
<p>中英成立信用借欵的消息傳出後。東京方面就有劇烈的反響。外務省訓令駐英大使吉田調查眞相。俾籌對策。政界人士亦表示日本雖不欲反對用於促進中國復興事業的建設借欵。但任何借欵而含有政治性質。足以擾亂東亞安寗的。則日本未便袖手旁觀。不加抗議。我們對於這種觀戚。不欲有所批評。但願指出英國這次貸欵給中國的動機。原來近年英國的在華市塲。已感受到很大的威脅。而最近華北私貨充斥。又危害了英國的正當貿易。它為維持其在華市塲。推銷其過剩商品起見。不得不另覓途徑。貸欵給中國。就是它覓得的途徑。而中國。適在經濟建設。積極進行的時候。對於外國的信用借欵。當然是很需要的。</p>
<p>利用外資。就表面上說。本無所謂善。也無所謂惡。埃及利用外資。間因此而亡國。蘇聯利用外資。却因此而完成了建設。其間的成敗得失。不在利用外資的本身。乃在利用外資的方法。中國利用外資的歷史巳有四十年了。其中大部份沒有用在生產事業。卽有少數用在生產事業的。也沒有確守平等互惠的原則。故不但沒有得到利用外資的好處。反喪失了許多主權。今後利用外資雖巳成了中國必然的命運。但怎樣利用外資。正是目前應該打算的問題。依照目前的情勢和過去的歷史經騐。我們以為利用外資。至少應當確守平等互惠的原則。絕對限於生產事業的部門。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况、午前因標紗花價稍拌、布價亦乏變動、乃下午標紗花漲風重熾、布業人心益形高昂、日商洋行下月份期貨細布細斜開出五百餘包、及下午加起（每疋）一角以外、現貨派出不旺、而各路現銷大旺特旺、天津·靑島·漢口·長沙·重慶·汕頭·廣州·福州·內地需胃加强、故市盤騰漲不已、本色棉布供給大為缺乏、東貨細布細斜上　初、內地帮及本街因時局關係、縮手不墊棧單、而染廠吸納不已、現本街手貨缺乏、進胃立濃、昨棧單貨細布細斜粗布等貨、又搜辦五百數十件、及怡和廠粗布一百餘件、價亦再漲（每疋）五分至一角即漂布藍布亦吿騰漲、綸昌乾坤印怡和金三塔等著各下檔漂布均吿售罄、手貨加價三·四角不等、藍布元斜亦漲價、惟不及本色布疋之迅速、印花貨及整理布疋均因坯布缺乏、出品减縮、逐日派出走銷極佳云、</p>

<p>咋日粉市、上午開盤、各月份又見一致騰漲之象、因洋麥報價、芝加哥回好三四角、坎拿大漲五六七角不等、故開價時業內外人心、又震活口、市塲方面、以廠方已失控制之方、業外多頭、未免又吸收甚力、照目下情形、與新麥時期已經不同、一則有貨可求、一則已感落令感落令、且國外麥價、始終難合、人心之扳持、自覺更有勁也、各月份之漲度、近好二分零、遠好三四分、迨至下午開盤、近期尙平、遠期則出戶見稀、進戶則極暢盛、良因洋麥比價、猶覺此廉於彼耳、此後情形、如無禁止出口之明文、市面恐漲易而跌雜矣、</p>

<p>— 謝嗣</p>
<p>錫琮：</p>
<p>接你的來信，知道你的轉學考試己經考上了，我聽了很快活。你說：「從此每天可以少走一點路，可以把走路的時間省下來多讀一點書了。」這兩句話是很對的，可是讀書不是一件很隨便的事，不是祇要把所有的時間都埋頭在書本子上就行的事。接你的祖父來信，說你祇喜歡讀小說，祇要一本小說在手，就躺在籐椅上成天會弄得飯都不想吃，我雖不反對少年人看小說，但我以為這種辦法是不對的。讀書也和吃東西一樣，吃了的東西，要使胃能够消化，而且要能够消化得乾凈。「生呑活剝」，「貪吃無厭」是要壞肚子的，這是一點；其次，吃的東西如不先加揀點，也要吃壞肚子，古人所謂「病從口入」，就是吃的東西不加揀擇的緣故。讀書也是一樣，成天埋頭在書本子裏，會使腦子充血，不久腦子就會發眩，這是對身體很危險的。並且像你這樣的讀書方法，一定不能够完全明瞭書裏面的意思，——頂多祇明瞭了書裏面所記載着故事，這也是不對的。少年人讀書，一面固然要明白書裏的內容，而最重要的還是明白分析別人寫文章的方法。因為我們讀書，一方面固然是求知識，一方面還在獲得別人寫文章的方法，以為我們自己寫文章時的參考。假如讀書時不加批判，不體味方法，我們自己就永遠不會寫文章，永遠不能够把我們的思想用筆墨來傳達給世人了。你想這樣的讀書有什麽用處呢？這樣的讀書，縱然讀了一世，縱然把眼面前的書都讀完了，都記住了，還不是祇和一只書架子同樣嗎？說句笑話，書架子到還可以當柴燒，讀了書不會發表的書呆子除了吃飯一點沒有用處的。</p>
<p>最要緊的，吃的東西有所謂「飲食中毒」，讀的書裏的也是有毒的，如不加選擇，腦子也有中毒的危險。這一點我希望你多請敎請敎你的老師，如果你們的老師已經有你們應讀的書單子開給你們了的話，那就很好，如果沒有，你們或者可以請老師開一張，或者你自己可以把想讀的書先請老師去檢定一下，老師說行，你就仔細去讀，道樣也許可以免去你腦子中毒的危險！</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我要同你講一講我過去讀書的壞經騐了，我受學校敎育的年齡比你遲，像你這時候的年齡我還在小學校裏，可是身心的發達是和你差不多的，我那時所喜歡的也是小說。那時學校的先生是禁止學生看小說的，但是小說裏的故事比課本裏的東西有　味，而且課本除國文，算術，英文，歷史，地理，理科等要稍加複習外，每天空下來的時間很多，我又不喜歡運動——那時學校裏也不來强迫我們去運動，於是我們同學裏面就有好幾位有採取偷看小說消磨我們的多餘時間的方法了。我那時是住在學校裏的，假日也不想回家了，因為可以整天躱在寢室　讀小說。平日把小說放在床頭邊，天剛有點白茫茫的時候，就拿起床頭邊的小晚來耽讀，上自修班的時候，也把小說放在敎科書下面，先生的脚步一離開，我的手就把敎科書合攏了，眼睛也就同時注到下面的油光紙細字的書上面去了。連睡覺前至息滅菜油燈的十廿分鐘還不肯給牠空過，寗可衣服等息了燈後暗中模索着再脫。</p>
<p>我在後期小學——那時呌高等小學——的三年所給我的身心的是些什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，牠使我的眼睛變成了近視：因為那些小說都是像目前五號字那麽大的石印本，加上油光紙的反光。晚上菜油燈的光線和早晨魚白色的晨光都是隔着粗黃夏布帳子被利用的，都非把書砸着鼻子不可。起初覺得眼球發漲，後來看黑板字就非坐在第一二排不可了。等進了中學，終於不帶眼鏡不成了。</p>
<p>第二，養成了我的神經衰弱及失眠症：寢室裏沒有自修室的設備，讀小說大都是睡在床上讀的，血液就很順利地集注在頭部了。先覺得臉熱，再覺得腦漲。雖腦子已萬分疲乏，但是「不知究竟如何，且聽下回分解」，一刀下去，噯呀一聲，究竟死了沒有呢？於是也就管不得腦子的疲乏不疲乏了。而且即使萬不得已放了下來，小說裏的故事雖不干己，一塲一塲也不由你不去思考，開着眼睛思索不算外，閉上眼睛還免不了做許多惡夢或溫夢。這樣起初是不想睡，後來就速要睡也睡不着了。到後來才知道這就是「失眠」，這就是所謂神經衰弱！</p>
<p>第三，使我養成了對讀書的「囫圇吞棗」的壞習慣：讀小說只注意故事，凡是少年人大都是如此的吧。而我那時所讀的都是章回小說，如唐傳，征東，征西，七俠五義，水滸，濟公傳，鏡花緣等等，固然也有描寫簡潔的東西，但是說書者用的課本，別字破句固然很多，長條乾菜似的緾夾二文章亦居多數。於是為趕快知道故事的內容，一方面對書裏面的生字，不得不採取「殺强盜」主義——如「咱」「喒」我就把牠們念成「自」「咎」一直念了三年——一方又不得不採「跑馬政策」，把故事中認以為不重要的叙述都趕快一目幾行的跑過去。結果，看小說的方法是如此，到看非小說時，就沒有法子不如此了。我記得那時我們共讀了三冊英文，前兩冊的生字可以從第一頁第一字牌到最後一頁為止按次序背誦，而第三冊的非但不能背誦，連拼音也拼不到十之七八了。所讀過的書，也只能知道一個模糊的大概，要問起內容來，也决不能淸淸楚楚的回答了。</p>
<p>第四，使我的身體受了不可　救的損傷；我讀過的小說裏面，有許多的描寫都極惡劣，且有許多催人早熟的明示和暗示，把少年時代的我，弄得如老年人似的腰痛腿酸。目前一想起來，實不勝痛恨和追悔。不加選擇，一味亂讀的危險，對議力未定，好奇心重的少年人，實在比毒蛇猛獸還要厲害。</p>
<p>錫琮，我在小學時期的情形，現在回想起來還怕得很，總歸一句話，我希望你不要蹈我的覆轍！</p>
<p>上面的話，是我的感想和壞經騐，現在我來在積極方面和你談一談讀書的方法吧。</p>
<p>讀書的目的，一是求知，二是把自己的所知去吿訴別人。求知是要求淸淸楚楚的知，換句話說，就是所讀的書要能够完完全全的懂得，懂得以後，再以你在別處所得的知做根據來加以批判。有人說，知識未充的人——就算是指你這樣的初中學生說吧——的批判是不正確的，不正確的批判還是不批判好，其實這種暹輯是錯誤的：我們要知道知無止境，如果中學生不能批判，那末大學生在學者的眼光裏看來何常够得上有批判的能力呢？卽如公認的所謂學者，在科學層出不窮的進程中，也何常能一定不變的下批判呢？批判是鍜鍊知識的斧錘，所知愈多，批判愈確，不斷的求知，不斷的批判，才是讀書的方法。光是求知不作發表，上面已經說過，這是無用的書呆子的讀書方法，雖則發表的不一定是成熟的思想，但看不練習發表的能力，即至思想成熟時，也就不能運用圓熟的方法來發表了。</p>
<p>根據這種簡單的原則，凡讀一篇文或一本書，必須先注意兩點：一文章的結構如何？二，文章的思想如何？須仔細細的加以分析和檢討。所以你必須要預備一本讀書摘記本。讀完之後，必須要做一個報吿。這種報吿雖不一定給誰看，但過了些時，你就可以知道這些報吿正確或錯誤了，因為你的道種有計划的讀書，一定逐漸能使你的知　增加，批判正確的</p>

<p>— 夏丐尊</p>
<p>弘一和尙未出家時，於藝事無所不精，自書法·繪畫·音樂·文藝乃至演劇·篆刻皆卓然有獨到處。嘗為余言：平生於昔樂用力最苦，蓋樂律　演奏皆非長期鍊修無由適度，不若他種藝事之可憑藉天才也。和尙先後在杭州·南京以樂施敎者凡十年，迄今全國為音樂敎師者十九皆其薪傳。所製一曲·一歌風行海內，推為名作。入山以後，從前種種胥成夢影。一日，劉生質平偕余往訪和尙於山寺，飯罷淸談，偶及當世樂敎。質平歎息於作歌者之難得，一任靡靡俗曲流行閭閻，深惜和尙入山之太蚤。和尙亦為憮然，允再作歌若干付之，余與質平皆驚喜。此七年前事也，七年以來，質平及其學友根據和尙所作歌辭，分別譜曲，反覆推敲，必得和尙印可而後定。復經上海故新華藝術專科學校·浙江寗波中學等處實地演奏，始携稿詣余，謀為刊行。作曲者五人：質平為和尙之弟子·學詠·希一·伯英。為質平之弟子，　棠為質平之再傳弟子，皆音樂敎育界之錚錚者·歌曲僅五首，乃經音樂界師弟　葉之合作，費七年光陰之　　，亦中國音樂史上之佳話矣，歌名淸凉，和尚之所命也。和尙俗姓李，名息，字叔同，又字惜霜，浙之平湖人。</p>
<h3 id="c123">「滅亡」七版題記 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>滅亡是我底第一次問世的作品，那是在一九二八年寫成的。現在算起來已經隔了八年了。最近乘着七版的機會，把牠仔細閱讀一通，刪改了不少的處所，交給書店改版重排。我在三四年前就有刪改這書的心思，但別的事情纏着我，使我未能如願。今天看完書店方面送來的校樣，心裏很痛快，覺得也算了卻一樁心願了。</p>
<p>然而同時我又起了別的感想。我彷彿又回到寫作這書的時代去了。關於寫作這書的動機和經過，我在寫作生活底回顧一文裏說得很詳細。這文章已收在我底短篇小說第一集裏面，故不便附印在這里。我當時還寫得有日記，但在一二八之役散失了。我還寫過一篇滅亡作者底自白，是對於某一些批評家的答辯，裏面有一大段話是敘述我創造杜大心道個典型時的態度，我覺得可以引在道里：</p>
<p>「我寫杜大心底思想時完全取着客觀的態度，並不曾把我自己底思想完全滲進去。我雖然不是杜大心底信徒，但我愛他，我對他的態度是很公平的，我為出他底好處，同時我也寫出他底弱底。不過像剛果倫君底批評卻是有點不公道。他說杜大心『參加革命的動機是不正確的，他是以工作抑止自己的苦悶，以革命發揮個人的理想。」我承認杜大心『是一個羅曼諦克的革命家，』這是不錯的，但要說他參加革命的動機不正確，就未免太寃枉他了。他之所以成為羅曼諦克的革命家，他之所以憎惡人類，一是由於他底環境，二是因了他底肺病「人是怎樣一個卑鄙的東西呀！』如果杜大心像沙寧一樣說了這句話，他是有權利的。他參加革命是一件事，他以工作抑止自己底苦悶又是一件事，並不是因為要抑止自己底苦悶才來參加革命。人是一個複雜的，有機的東西，而有肺病的人更是多感的；參加革命之後，他不能就變成一部機器，他底環境依然使他苦悶，但他並不幻滅，並不放棄一切，當然只有拿工作來抑止自己底苦悶了。我自己當時也曾得着一個國內朋友底信，他說他很苦痛，日來「以忙為醉。「這不也是和杜大心一樣嗎？至於杜大心底死亡，我以為是必然的。剛君說『僅止因着一個朋友的朋友的被殺去犧牲自己的生命，去報仇，……不是革命黨人應有的態度」不過剛君如果再去深思一下，他一定會明白杜大心底面前只有死的一條路。一個憎惡人類憎惡自己的人，結果不是殺人被殺，就是自殺，在我看來他並沒有第三條路可走，何况杜大心又有肺病呢？復仇還是小事，最重要的是他底　期的肺病使「他開始覺碍這長久不息的苦　應該停止了，他想休息，他想永久地休息」而事實上在他，他只有「死才能够使他享着安靜的幸福」（三三〇頁）俄國政治家拉狄穴夫在靑年時期中會有一個同學得了不治之症，那人呌拉狄穴夫拿　藥把他毒死，拉氏不答應，卻在自己底日記上寫道：「不能忍受的生活應該用暴力來毀壞。『他自己後來也自殺了。杜大心『知道他自己在竭力向着死之路上走去，而且分明感到死是一天逼近一天，』當然會採取用暴力來毀壞生活的一條路。我自己是反對他採取道條路的，但我無法阻止他，我只有為他底死而哭。」</p>
<p>在初版本的滅亡的第一頁上我印過一句獻辭，我把這書歡給我的第一個哥哥，他是對於我的智的發展給了極大的幫助的第一個人。現在我刪去了這短短的獻辭，因為我的這哥哥巳經離開這世界了。我寫這書給他看，是為了求他瞭解我，讓我安心地去走我自己的路。然而我們終於不能瞭解地永遠分離了。</p>
<p>我反覆地翻閱着面前一頁一頁的校樣，想在這些油光紙上面找到什麽東西。我怕回憶，但是如今我又絕望地求助於回憶了。</p>
<p>暮春的凍風從窗外吹進來，周圍靜寂無聲，夜是很遲了。一個人枯坐在窗前寫些文章，有什麽用處？難道我不能够去做一點更有用的事情麽？</p>
<h3 id="c124">介紹兩本可讀的書 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 艾箕</p>
<p>……化學的故事和算學的故事……</p>
<p>人人都知道化學是近世科學之一，同時也都承認牠不是憑空而偶然產生的。但若問某某世紀前後的化學狀况怎樣？當時有那些化學家？他們有什麽永可紀念的貢獻？他的貢獻又怎樣得來？就不是人人可能答復了。譬如氫·氣·氮·氯等氣體是誰發現的？那一年發現？發現的詳細經過及方法怎樣？這些都是很有價値的問題。但道除非讀過化學史的人，恐怕誰也無從明瞭。又如卡文提什（Cavendirh）用什麼方法從空中發現硝酸？道爾頓（Dallon）用什麽方法測定原子量？構造學說怎樣萌芽？電子觀念和原子構造學說又怎樣發，起來？這除非化學史，而决不是死板的化學敎科書可以概括的有統系的告訴我們的。</p>
<p>說起敎科書，它有時固然可以引導學生們去硏究各學科，但有時它也是學生們研究各種學問的大障礙。因為它的內容是受着課程標準和其他方面的限制的，往往祇是片段的死知識，而不是有系統的活知識。</p>
<p>現在為了要使一般靑年學生對於化學能得一旣有系就而又活潑的知識起見，特介紹日人益用苦良著任一碧譯的化學的故事（開明版，價五角五分。）這是一部內容精彩揭要，譯筆流麗暢達的簡明化學史。它也是山於著者對於學校敎科書的不滿才產生的，這從下面著者序文中的一段話看出來：</p>
<p>「我在師範學校担任化學和物理的功課時，對於敎科　懷抱着痛切的不滿……學生所具有的學科的興趣，本來多　敎師的手腕，而如今的敎科書似手都把教師的手腕在制住。………化學原是富有興趣的學科，但照現在的敎科　的內容，是决不能使學生　足的。為補救這個缺　起見，站在與敎科　相異立塲，並且以興它絕無關係的方法　說化學的歷史，確實是必要的事。</p>
<p>上面是　　的旨　和立場，現在把它的內容　約的介紹一下：這　分為　後　　，前篇　　　　　（Luvci　ir）　　　　　，後稱叙述　　　　後　　。在拉　　以前，化學始終　　荒　的燃　　的　　中，得不到光明的普照照，直到拉瓦節的時代，他才大胆地把支配了化　數——年的　　　　　　倒了，從此化學得見天日，而　　　晨以至於現在的境地。所以著者就把化學的歷史劃，分為這樣的兩個時期。又前篇共四章。第一章為「化學的先驅·鍊金術「，說明化學起源於鍊金衛，而隨着鍊金衛的進步而逐漸發達的情形。第二章為」波義耳以前」，說明波義耳（Boyle）以前及在他的時代的化學的發展情形。第三章為「燃燒的學說」，說明自波義耳以後一百年間的化學家們的思想被荒謬的燃素說所支配的情形以及社勒（Schule）和普利斯特利（Priestley）發見氧的經過。第四章是「近代化學的建設，講拉瓦節打倒燃素說的情形以及和他仝同代的其他化學家對於化學的貢獻。後篇共分八章，就是「德維與其弟子，」「原子，分子說的發展」，「元素符號與化學式的由來」，「元素發見與週期律」，「溶液論之今昔」，「電離說的出現，」「原子與分子的大小，」「化學的革命」。我們祇要把這八章看過一篇，就可很有系統地知道自拉瓦節以迄現在的化學的大槪經過情形。</p>
<p>除上面所有的精彩的內容外，這書還蘊藏着好幾個特點，我們自應把他提出來談一談：第一，一般的化學敎科書，其內容的取捨，全以化學家的試騐的結果的有無為標準，所以不論理論上，或試騐上，凡無結果，或結果不良，以及結果與常則相反的，往往拋棄不講。但在這書中，迭因與結果並重，所以不以成敗論人，能使讀者們看出化學思想和觀察之變遷的線索。第二，普通編化學敎本的人，因了不得已的緣故，往往把數百年來乃至數千年來的化舉家們所造成的許多結果，毫無連系地編制起來，想把這些囫圇呑棗的裝到學者的腦袋裏去。不管牠會不會消化，弄得一個化學變成了很不自然的機械。這書的編制就沒有上面的弊病，他决不要我們很勉强的去硬記那印板式的事實。第三，它能指示我們認識化學是無止境的，並引導我們走上一條大路，敎我們努力去探掘化學所蘊藏着的寳窟。所以我方敢介紹這書。</p>
<p>其次，我們再來談談算學的故事。（開明版，定價六角五分）</p>
<p>假使我們向中學校的學生問：「你喜歡算學麼」？那恐怕他們的十分之七八將會回答：一我不大喜歡」，或有人會說：「我對牠頗覺討厭」。自曾考　辦以來，不及格的人數較多的學科恐怕也是算學。「艱道算學果是一種可憎的學科麽。它為什麼不易和人親近？被人歡喜呢？有沒有補救的方法呢？我不禁發生了這樣的疑問了。</p>
<p>「算學所具的純粹抽象性，是最不易領會的，一般人的討厭算學，說算學不容易　，大概是在這一點，而歷來的算學敎授，又是注意在這一點，所以會造成令人愈弄愈不懂的局面。有人給算學下定義，說是，不問牠是什麽，到還明白，你要間牠是什麽，反而愈弄愈不明白；這就是道出算學的抽象性的，對於平常一般人抽象得太利害了，確是不易理會。</p>
<p>「不過，一定要抽象得利害，纔算是算學嗎？在粗淺的地方，在實際的社會生活上，我們不是常常有算學的問題麽，為什麽一定要去學那書本上的抽象的不容易懂的算學呢？道便是歷來算學敎育失敗之所在。一般人並不要求怎樣高深的抽象的算學，而敎算學的偏不肯用具體的來代表抽象給一個明顯的實在，於是算學成為不可解不容易懂而為人所討厭的一種學科了。」</p>
<p>上面是章克標先生所著的算學的故事序文中的二段話。由這，我們可知道算學並不是生來就被人討厭而不易和人親近的，原因袛在人們不會好好地運用它，研究它。</p>
<p>近來，很有些人，常以生動活潑的筆調，來寫算學的小品文章。如劉薰宇先生的「數學園地」「數學趣味」便是。這種寫法，很可使學生們引起研究算學的興趣。這確是補救一般算學敎科書的不足的一個好方法。</p>
<p>不論研究何種功課，若想事半功倍，那末，硏究的方法先須由合而分，終須由分而合；換言之，就是先須以歸納的方法求得某畢科的所有重要概要，然後以演繹法推廣開去，最後再以歸納法把各項較廣博而眞確的知識綜合起來。惟有這樣的學習方法，才能使學科頭頭是道，左右逢源。學習算學的方法也應這樣，應先得一全部算學的概念，然後才能按步就班的研究上去。這本「算學的故事」就是應這樣的需要而產生的。請看章先生的話：「本書為靑年課外閱讀之用，求其淺　，故不說及算理………只是注意其發展的大槪情形罷了……區區之意，想由此可以多少增加些算學的興趣，對這乾燥無味的算學一科給予一點滋潤，使算學不致一味被視為討厭的學科。」</p>
<p>它的編制是這樣的：以算學一科發違的徑路為骨幹，記述自古至近世的各個有名算學家的遺聞逸事，以及各人對於算學上的各項貢獻。對於正式的算理是很少說明的，但也注意科學如何會興，如何會衰的因果關係。又它在表面上雖祇記述各個人物，但在骨子裏，我們很可看出那個時代的文化上以及政治上的背景，這就是本書的另一特性。</p>

<p>向來緝私之弊、、多在於吃曠呑蝕賣缺放私贓、詐索等事、自糟核所接收准北等十一區緝私機關、卽將緝私營改編為稅警、汰弱留强、嚴加訓練、所有官警之登庸黜陟、悉按稽核所人事管理章程辦理、以安職守、並實行軍需獨立、點名發餉、服裝槍械、亦由稽核所採投標方法購發、以往積弊、一掃而空、近年該數區內銷鹽數量之增進、實為未兼辦各區域所不及、</p>
<p>整理場產</p>
<p>吾國鹽塲、從未管理得法、故走私易、而鹽稅之損失、每年達數千萬元、鹽務糟核所成立後、即建築長蘆官坨、近年增建圍塲壕溝馬路、並於塲內設稅警分駐所及塲務所等、俾於存儲鹽斤外、同時管理灘產、駁運及防閑灘私、近五年來、淮北灘坨各項工程、亦次第設備、塲私銳减、魯浙蘇閩等亦正　築、將來各項工和吿竣、場私杜絕、稅收自旺、</p>
<p>改進運銷</p>
<p>如揚子四岸之輪銷制度、實為官鹽滯銷主因、現巳逐漸推行有限制自由貿易、以為廢止之初步、並准四岸淮鹽、無論在塲在岸、於法定價下、自由縮减、俾得競售、對於輪運、亦予提倡、以節運費、此外復取消浙東溫處二屬及福建延建邵三屬包商、實行自由貿易、開放南京市山東臨郯費沂四縣等為自由貿易區、俾作實施新鹽法之準備、</p>
<p>取締硝鹽</p>
<p>冀魯豫各區、每年因硝土鹽侵銷、稅收損失達三千餘萬元、民二十一年間、各省硝磺局歸稽核所並辦、至二十四年、硝磺收入增四倍以上、因製硝所出之硝鹽、現亦概行傾棄、以杜充食鹽走私、並於長蘆區會同地方官及公正士紳、勸導人民、平毀土鹽池、一面興辦水利、變更土質、消除土鹽、二十四年份該區稅收、較二十三年因以增加三百餘萬元、在河南則由公家撥欵、會同省方整理水道、改良土壤、並設改良鹼土農事試騐塲、成績甚著，數千年來鹽務中最困難之硝土鹽問題、已有解决之望、</p>
<p>平衡則</p>
<p>鹽稅稅則、民初稽核所成立以後、卽經從事整理、一度頗趨整齊、及後國事蜩螗、政局不定、地方政府率自擅加附稅附加、以致各成區域、輕重不一、國府成立後、極力整理、先行劃一稅日、將以前紛亂繁雜之各種各式名目、分別歸併、凡在產區繳納之塲稅、及中央附稅、統名之為正稅、在銷區繳納之岸稅、及中央附稅、統名之為銷稅、嗣財部於二十二年通令自二十三年一月一日起、所有中央正附稅及地方附稅、合計每担在十元以上者、一律减為十元、其在十元以下者、應俟察酌情形、徐圖改善、以均負担、現今各區稅則、業已漸見平衡、而歷來所有之各項陋規、則近年已根本革除矣、</p>
<p>稅收增加</p>
<p>査民國十三年稅收為七千五百餘萬元、歷年漸增、至二十四年為一萬八千三百餘萬元、其間允以稽核所兼辦行政緝私之成效為著、如民三至民十七年之十五年間、兼辦行政緝私之淮北等十一區、及未兼辦之廣東等九區之稅收、總平均數均為三千五百餘萬元、至民二十二年、前者為一萬一千四百餘萬元、後者僅四千五百萬元、相去達七千萬元之鉅、民二十二年後、因長蘆口北兩區劃入、則前者為一萬四千六百餘萬元、後者僅三千六百餘萬元、而鹽務經費一項、則自兼辦行政緝私以後、每年可减少三百五十萬元、近年稽核機關、職務雖有增加、經費則儘量卽省、二十四年度運行政經費之預算、尙不及稅收百分之五、而緝私方面之增加士警、添購槍械、且較前此開支為鉅、</p>
<p>外債减除</p>
<p>民國二年以後、鹽稅原為善後大借欵之惟一擔保、且因此而招致外人干涉鹽政之漸、國府成立以後、除以維護國家主權、改革稽核所管理外、所有外債事項、統歸財部主管、稽核所僅管稅收、更將善後借欵担保、盡移入關稅收入項下、掙出鹽稅、充實國用、目前由鹽稅担保之外債、已僅有英法借欵、克利斯浦借欵、湖廣借欵等三項、亦均於數年之內、可以分別償淸、綜之、吾國鹽政、自國府成立以來、進步之速、成績之著、實為前此所未有、目今立法院對於鹽務組織、已採一元制、自合於政治原理、苟本此一貫精神、使全國各區同樣予以整理、其成效當更有可觀云、</p>

<p>無頭箱屍案、自發生後、因所獲人犯林根弟、茅阿根、蔣元菼、供詞互異、旣承認於前、復翻供於後、致雖經迭次訊理、迄未能决、昨日午後二時、又經特一法院鐘清推專開刑二庭續訊、旁聽者仍擁擠不堪、先　捕房律師張師竹起稱、於本月三日、捕房會向林所帶庭時、於本月一日、本案開庭之前、林　弟由押所帶庭時、茅阿根之妻會向林謂、在庭供時、須說殺人在八月八日、不可說在九日、而退庭之後茅妻又將林根弟</p>
<p>毆擊一拳</p>
<p>並據其稱、在殺死彩英時、門上掛有紅色衣服一件、當時茅等卽令林穿着、以避免血跡染於身上、而林根弟於八月十三日、會向其母林許氏謂死人之衣服可否穿着、經其母痛罵一頓、今林許氏亦在庭、而大新公司方面今日亦有鄭德寶·曹厚卿·等到案、應　　訊、而本月六日下午四時、承辦此案之華探員黃福森、向西探目馬亞報吿、請茅會向其　如</p>
<p>能不辦罪</p>
<p>則當籌以四百元、該欵可向新閘救火會一號救火員借取云云、故本案三被吿、應請隔別硏訊、庭上准之、遂先向林根弟質問、據供、茅阿根之妻曾命我說殺人日期係在八日、否則卽欲打我、因此上次我卽供八日、實在係在八月九日、而當時茅·蔣·二人確係在塲、上次退庭之後茅妻又在我胸部毆打一拳云云、庭上卽傳林根弟之母到庭、據供、彼夫家實姓樂、而非林姓、住新疆路華振坊三十二號、林根弟</p>
<p>係其親女</p>
<p>彼之姓實由於自己所改、在本年八月十三日半夜十二時、我女突來向我說救火員送其舊衣服幾件、並稱死人之衣服、是否可穿、我答不可、並打其耳光一下、彼卽臥於地上、彼平日夜間、住於何處、我均不知、彼目係痴子、人均呼之為十三點、有時常睡於路中云云詰之林根弟、對其母所述、表示不錯、繼由證人　宏生投稱、、在大新公司為稽查、與林</p>
<p>根弟之母</p>
<p>係老鄰居、林原名桃李、有十三點之號、當捕房至大新公司調查時、會詢找林有否記憶、彩英其人、是否來充過女招待、不得而知云云、茅阿根之律師范剛卽起稱、本月三日、本律師會喬裝遊客至大新公司調査、據揚州班一號女招待朱鳳蘭稱、凡來充女招待者、均須有人介紹、故此點應請向鄭詢問、但據鄭答、在開慕之時、女招待頗感缺乏、凡有人願來充任者、歡迎之不及、焉用介紹云云、禮由上海市公安局</p>

<p>彩英租住</p>
<p>等語、嗣由馮張氏投稱、向居寗波、於本年廢歷三月二十二日來申、住於存福里二號亭子間、我女余馮氏、後因天氣炎熱、乃商得管弄人同意、暫住於三號之亭子間內、至七日念一日始回甬、在此期內、並無女招待之女子住衣服等物帶回家中、我乃向樂許氏詢問、據稱衣服並無帶回、祇詢及死人之衣可否穿着等語、餘事不知、又據鄭德寶（卽小德寳、證稱、在大新公司揚州劇塲為茶堂頭目、林根弟曾來做過女茶房、約一月左右、平日有十三點之樣子公司開幕時、進出之</p>
<p>數以百計</p>
<p>故野雞班之女招待、均不能於其內、左右隣亦無此等人物居住、我所睡之床、係用三塊木板搭成、捕房吊案之木板、卽係我睡覺者、庭上卽詢以該板上現經</p>
<p>驗有血跡</p>
<p>該血跡從何而來、答或係臭虫之血、亦未可知、庭上詢以林根弟、此人認識否曾否至存福里三號來過、答、我每日均睡於內、並未見過林根弟其人來過、故亦不相識云云、又據該氏之女余馮氏投稱、自一二八之後、卽住於存福里二號亭子間內、而三號內並無女招待者、住於其內、左右隣亦無作女招待之人云云、鍾推事乃命提蔣元菼至案、訊據供稱、我實無殺死彩英之學、以前所供、實因</p>
<p>受刑不過</p>
<p>所致、庭上乃詢以爾前在捕房供與彩英姘識、係由林根弟所介紹、後卽至金合旅館開一〇二號房間住宿、是否有此事實、答並無其事、遂由黃福森探目投禀向金台旅館調査情形、謂於九月二十一日上午十一時五分至五十分、帶同蔣元英至福州路二三一號金台旅館、因蔣不能記出當時所寫之姓名、故無法調査、范剛律師卽稱、據法醫騐得無頭屍體、</p>
<p>患有毒疾</p>
<p>故請庭上再將床板上之血檢騐、是否相同、而蔣元英之律師沈老祥則請將盛屍之箱及盛頭之蒲包上所留血跡、與床板上之血予以檢騐、是否同素、因若非同素、則此案卽可迎刃而解矣、庭上然之、詰之茅阿根、仍堅稱被誣、謂彩英面貌如何、身材如何、均不知悉、焉能殺彼、而林根弟前因聞我薪水頗大、故欲嫁我但我因其</p>
<p>狀若痴子</p>
<p>且與五六一號救火員姘過而某日晚林至新閘救火會我我、適我在樓上、而門口有三百號、八百零二號、兩救火員睡在、詎林竟撫摸該二人之下體、二人因此驚醒、向我吿知、經我將林大駡一頓、並不准其下次再來、致結仇隙、而對我誣陷云云、但林則否認、范律師卽起請庭上將林根弟送醫騐治、是否確有神經病症、及心理上變態、因據證人等之供述、林實有精神病也、鍾推事核禀、乃諭本案改期本月二十九日下午二時再訊、林根弟應送法醫研究所診斷有無精神病症再核、</p>

<p>調查經過</p>
<p>情形、謂本月十一號夜十時左右、戈登路捕房二九二〇號華捕在出事地點附近巡邏、突聞延平路膠州路口有槍聲數響、亟往調査、則見二七三號弄內、有一男子倒臥血泊中、槍傷頗多、乃以電話報吿捕房、飭救護車往將傷者車送紅十字會醫院、因不及救治、中途氣絕身死、尸送騐尸所、一面派探調查、因該處地處荒僻、人跡稀少、且死者衣服艦樓、以為黑籍中人、故决非謀財善命、諒係</p>
<p>被誘仇殺</p>
<p>再查死者前後身中大小不一之槍口、有十四處之多、照此情形、當時至少有兇手二人、各執手槍、曾與死者作猛烈之扭毆、致死者衣服撕破、除在該處檢獲彈充數枚外、並在死者身畔抄出紙頭三張、一為掛號單、一為滙票之收據、另一紙為仁和當之當票、捕房乃向郵局調查、據稱有住居檳榔路四百號門牌之康姓</p>
<p>前來寄款</p>
<p>中西探卽往檳椰路調查、詎並無四百號門脾、故其郵寄時所書之地址、實係僞造、繼乃至仁和當、查得於九月廿八號有住居檳榔路同茂里九百四十號之康姓前來質當小皮箱一隻、計二元一角五分、當時因原當票遺失、照章於補票時須具店保證明、故由同茂里　百卅一號許永興烟紙店蓋章作保、捕房當將所質之皮箱吊出、檢視之下、內有</p>
<p>紙條數紙</p>
<p>均為某警探隊長之通信處、及尹某之底稿一紙、內中所言則為婦女爭風吃醋之事、繼又赴許永興烟紙店調查、據店主許金山·許徐氏·夫婦二人稱、彼等與康文進素不相識、係由向業看門巡捕之張懷勝介紹作保、張住同弄九百四十號云云、中西探又往該處密查、見九百四十號進出之男女頗多、且均屬安徽人、故於昨晨往將</p>
<p>室中男女</p>
<p>十五人一併拘入捕房嗣經許徐氏指明內中之一人卽張懷勝、遂將張牧押、餘人釋放、查張前確受哈同洋行雇為看門巡捕、嗣因犯敲詐案被控、於本月七號被革、今捕房因調査手續、尙未完備、且查得擊斃康文進之手槍、係與本年四月十九號辣斐德路辣斐大戲院</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>擾攘中，人羣和車子在街道上流。從北到南，幾天來是忽然緊張，忽然冷寂，又忽然熱鬧起來。像個潰爛的癱，那忍耐不往的濃液，從被壓制中迸發開來，於是便向街道上流：最先是漂亮的汽車，笨重的搬塲車，然後是人力車，老虎車，甚至是兩脚的車；最先是漂亮的西裝，長袍，和秋裝的旗袍子，然後是短褂和短褲子，夾在這些大人中間是　知的小孩子，甚至也有在胸脯里懷抱了嬰孩。</p>
<p>空氣像鉛，展不開的是人心的鬱結；也像飄落着的楊花，在風雨中遍處飛灑。謠言揷起了翅膀，到處在飛；事實當前，人家的武裝搖動了喪家人的膽汁。</p>
<p>到現在是不是知什麼地方有安牢之家；家在人家屋詹底下。嚇壞了的靈魂經不起多决風雨的摧殘，問國魂何處？</p>
<p>可憐無吿的弱小子民，你們那兒去哪？</p>
<p>蹀躞於擁擠的街道中，看人潮在流轉。在行人道上，更在交叉的街口，成羣的骨碌碌的眼珠子在看什麼啊？車，不停止的車；人，走不完的人。在鄉村的道途上，人會疑心農村發生了災荒，是什麼地方泛濫了洪水，或太陽　乾了整個的村莊？逃難的人呀，亦都市，擺成了行列，沒有旗幟，沒有新的或舊的音樂，只是成列的車子，成列的人：所有幾個世紀的運輸工具，從汽車到一支扁擴；所有幾個世紀的服飾，從一九三七年式的新裝到泥腿褲子。</p>
<p>還要說什麼啊？你看那裏面有一個馬桶，一張蓆子，或一個破爛衣箱……椅子呀，鏡屛呀，各式傢具俱全。人呢？老婆婆抱着小孫子，老虎車上坐着鄉下人。工人和農人徒步走啊有車子坐的才是幸福呢。</p>
<p>一媽，阿拉要坐地那車子哪。」一個小孩孑哭。</p>
<p>女人的眉頭展不開。</p>
<p>「啥車子啦？」</p>
<p>小孩子的手指一指，一架漂亮的汽車從傍邊虎的一聲滑開過去了。</p>
<p>警察的手裏撲攫了一只坐墊。</p>
<p>黃包車夫哀吿道：</p>
<p>「謝謝儂呀！……</p>
<p>一支棍子揮下來。</p>
<p>「滾開，滾開。跑啦，跑啦。到鄕下逃難去吧！」</p>
<p>「嗤！」人叢中一個聲音笑了。</p>
<p>「打吧！讓他打吧！應該打一打吧！」全個都市和村莊的聲音。</p>
<p>聽呵！都市的聲音多麼混雜呢！</p>
<p>「呼呼……」</p>
<p>「吱吱……」</p>
<p>「篤篤……」</p>
<p>……</p>

<p>— 楚陽</p>
<p>近日每到了黃昏時節便起了心情的茫然悸動，就好像窗外那邊私人園子裏的秋柳搖曳在晚風裏一樣。</p>
<p>——秋的憂鬱呢？亡國的悲哀呢？還是生之困惱，病的倦怠所致呢？</p>
<p>自己也漠然不知所答，祇覺呆在屋子裏一身都不自在，一份報紙翻得亂亂地。桌上剛纔看過的一本「田園交響樂」被風吹得合起來，想着紀德的一句話：「沒有眼睛的人該是多麽幸福」！心更加沉下去……</p>
<p>這亭子間小得除了陳設着一床一桌一椅外步也邁不開，要休息一下，就祇有躺倒在床上了。床上有一封下午接到的信，本來是安閑地在江灣上大學的朋友在信尾說：「去年此時騷擾之狀又陳現於目前，遷徙者絡繹不絕，一夕數驚，頗不能自安，不禁羨慕兄等居住之平靜也。」</p>
<p>——啊，誰還能平靜麼？</p>
<p>一凡有中國人血者都不能平靜了喲！</p>
<p>不能平靜也還不是欵在亭子間裏發惱，智識份子永遠就是神經衰弱的Semtimentist，身與心都在不强健的矛盾狀態中。——又是這樣自己駡自己。</p>
<p>跳起來，看看天，天上不是沒有雲彩，夕陽正投過幾道金色的光，混上一層媒烟，這都市的天色總是沉悶甚於明朗的顏面。底下碰的重響一聲，使得我心驚一下，原來是下面住的那對靑年夫婦推着漂亮的小兒車出去散步。看着那瘦長的與嬌小的雙雙背影慢慢地向弄堂口走去，徒然便覺着自己的孤單來。本來也想出去散步的，但一想到一個人踽踽掠涼地　了着也就無趣，便又遲疑了。腦子裏卻浮現一個家的幻影：難道自己也在要求一個伴侶，一個家麽？</p>
<p>家興國，女人與生活，人生便是在這些欲望與意志的煩惱裏度它的日子。希望是有一個光輝的明天的，但今天這個黃昏，就好像是個無盡的黃昏！</p>

<p>— 隅</p>
<p>剖開了肚子檢査，原沒有一點墨水，然而要充滿腹經綸的蜘蛛的，還是我輩這些拿文字拼七巧板的文氓。驢子轉磨，轉來轉去，依然是這未一會事。可是驢子是可原諒的。它的轉磨，不是出於自願，而是被迫。在驢子身上，我們可以看到在肩胛上的覊軛，可以看到蒙在眼上的「滿眼」，在它的後面，我們也可以聽到駕卸者「呵嚇」的呼聲，或者鞭子「噼啪」的威脅。驢子是可憐的，我輩不禁這樣想。可是當它息駕以後，有些草料給牠，或者主人加惠，額外增添一些豆麥，或者慈婉地在它脊背上摸上幾把，這在驢子就覺得無限光榮，於是「咆哮」幾聲，自鳴得意。這在主人，是一種手段，而在驢子，不過表現其笨拙可憐而已。</p>
<p>驢子轉應，這是古已有之的事；然而牽出驢子去，虛張聲勞，卻未免和牽狗去耕田一樣滑稽。所以，前鬥來了狼羣，不張弓設矢，而把剛從駕上卸下的驢子去「咆哮聲聲」，以求嚇退，這簡直是和驢子一樣笨拙的把戲</p>
<p>雖然也會有驢子能「痴裏帶乖」，會蒙上虎皮，但虎皮的被人截穿，不過是早遲間事。當然就驢子講，它何嘗不自視龐然大物，但「技止此耳」，早已有人講過。然而除此技外，又有什麽好弄？</p>
<p>在驢子本身，它會設想它自己混身都是本領，正如我們會設想我們有千手千脚，我們會設想有好多光榮的頭銜。可是有人早已吿訴我那個從未加冕的「王冠」，已被人置在厠所的一角，而我們頭上所載的那頂帽子，乃是紙做的，類乎一個人動了公憤被捺去遊街時人家替我們戴上的那一頂尖銳的紙帽子差不多。如果曉得這一層，最好的辦法就是不必多事囉喳，正如驢子不必多事咆哮一樣。所以到了事不尋常的期間，百無　的我們，即是有用，至多也只能帮帮塲趁趁熱鬧。如此而已。不則即使有高明的意見，口對心講，是可以的，去草萬言策論，就必會覺得話從什麼地方說起呢？無從，而又固執地要說，辦法是有的。那就是「陳言」是抄。可是抄中國人的，得防備人家送上一個「文抄公」的徽號。最好的辦法，那末還是抄外國人的吧。</p>
<p>這兒我就是抄外國人的文寫。（因為技術不高明，連抄也不能抄全，這我自然管不了許多。）</p>
<p>我曾看過載在今年美國出版的亞細亞雜誌上那位號稱中國通的「賽珍珠」女士那篇China　Aginst　Jspan的大文，那樣的玄秘的論斷，我讀了以後，就覺得不快，第一是因為牠極端讚美日本。這兒我得聲明，我的不快，並不是因為她讚美日本。如果因為讚美日本，而就不快，有人也許要講我是中了狹溢國家主義的毒。但我相信並不是一盲目的國粹主義者。她的論斷，我所以反對，因為她也像其他帝國主義者的學者一樣，把帝國主義的侵略，認為是優秀民族開化落後民族的一種使命。她認為日本攫取了中國，對於中國物質上是有利益的，中國公路將要建造，商業將要發展，災荒將要防止，政治將要上軌道，匪徒將要絕跡，工廠將要添建，而鐵路網也將貫通全國。在物質方面是如此，而在精神建設方面，文盲則將日少，衛生情形則將大形改進，中國的沙眼，肺病，瘧疾，與鈎蟲都將大量减少。「誰都不能否認這些事實。「這樣的說話我眞疑心是出之於「王道樂土「宣揚者的口中，而不相信是出於曾與中國有因緣而與日本毫無關係的一個美國婦人之口。我不曉得她根據什麽來替帝國主義作義務的宣傳。這是她的高明的意見中我所反對的一點。</p>
<p>第點她是一個唯武器論者，她說中國在戰爭的立塲上，不能抵抗日本，因為中國除開大量的無訓練的人可充作砲灰外，毫無設備可言。　真把中國人視做她的貴國內的印第安部落都不如。我們知道美國自從建國後，雖然把那些印　安人使之「馴服」，把他們的土地逐漸搶奪過來。而驅逐他們至所謂保留區域。這樣的工作，幾世紀纔完成，一直到十九世紀的中葉，印第安人的反抗，還時有所聞，中間還曾有幾次，美國政府，吃過了幾次敗仗。我不相信一個四萬萬人的偉大民族會像她所說那樣容易被人家當做砲灰。這種印象的由來，也許因為中國人自己有些地方太曳氣的原故，東三省熱河無抵抗而遭人占領，冀省軍隊，經人一嚇而就撤退，那些自命為中國通的而其實一無所通的外國人，自然會覺得中國人只能做砲灰之用而無別用了。</p>
<p>第三點，我反對者，她簡直把中國人都當做些苟全性命自私自利的「寳貨」。自然這樣的人，不能說中國人中間沒有，可是她把道個汚辱的標識，加在中華民族的頭上，卻是我們所不敢領敎。雖則她沒有像她所讚美的鄰邦官佐松室孝良所說的中國「大部官民，率多利令智昏，顧家忘國，甚至甘心禍國，其目的只求一身一官集團的慾望解决，他若國事民生，「概不顧」那樣懷有惡毒的用意，卻犯了同樣的膚淺的錯誤。她說「在個人方面，中國人是隨遇而安的，如果沒有極大的享樂，卽是普通的小的快樂，也願意接受的，同時失敗對於他們不足為辱，而成功也不足為喜，求生至不能至最後限度然後纔甘心去死，而視生命較榮譽野心及愛國心為寳貴。</p>
<p>中國一切人部是否如她所說的呢？我不願意去到中國那些一長串的歷史中我人物來證明，因為那些人物已屬於過去的了。而活生生生活在我們中間的人，我可以找出好多階層各種類型的人物來證明並不是，凡中國人都可以歸入這一範疇中去的。</p>
<p>我總覺得那些所謂什麽『通』，也像許多學術上的一知半解的所謂專家一樣，先立了一個大前提，把宇宙一切現象都把它們簡單化了而列入那一大前提的前面，那一個大前提本身是否準確，他可不問，而一切現象又是否可歸入那大前提的裏面而推出一個結論，他也不問，他所唯一的目的，就在捉牢他那自以為是的大前提，而很快地找出結論，能够得到一個結論，不問結論是否眞實，然而他的目的已逮，他可以不管其他一切。所以外國的那些「支那通」只要到過一次上海，或者從上海跑過去幾里路，或者讀過幾本中國書，或者見個幾個中國人，或者看見了幾件中國的事物，他就認為已經知道中國以及中國人了。於是和這幾個中國人談過話，或者摭拾幾件他所眼見到耳聽到事，說「道便是中國」，或者說「這便是中國人。」更由這幾件事與這幾個人進一步就推斷說：「這便是中國的命運。」結果是天方夜譚中的中國人出現於外國人的前而，古宮博物院中的中國文物出現於外國人的前面，四書五經老莊哲學中的中國人的特質出現於外國人的前面，而中國那些敎養於外國居住於中國租界的所謂高等華人，也為騙外國人，引起外國人的好奇的原故，不惜迎合外國人的所好，故意抽象地虛構許多神秘的事物，把中國變做一個莫名其妙的國家，那些輕信的外國人，更信為實有其事，於是說某中國名人說中國是這樣，可見中國是這樣的了。</p>
<p>詭辯本身不是一個罪惡，然而別有企圖的詭辯卻是一個罪惡。無意造成的扭曲的詭辯是可原宥的，而有意造成的詭辯卻是不可原宥的。固然在我們的周圍，有許多尙沒有進達於脊椎動物階段的皮囊，但也有許多堅實硬正頂天立地的男士站在我們的前面。在北平大刀隊衝進了學校，以木棍徒手與警軍堅持幾小時而不退讓的是一種人，在天津，不願做漢奸而堅决以死命拚的又是一種人，在東北堅堅反抗旗幟的又是一種人，在廣大的中國黃土層的原野，沉默地等待民族解放信號的又是一種人。詩人桑德堡（Carl　Sandburg）的預言，也許不久總會席捲於我們的前面；</p>
<p>億兆人的蓬勃的熱情能够起來</p>
<p>成為一旋風；在飚一次發動，　誰能駕御呢？你麼？抑你麼？抑你麼？只有歷史，只有明天知道</p>
<p>因為每次的革變爆發出來像</p>
<p>它自己的動亂時間出生的嬰孩一樣</p>

<p>我站在一個孤墳之前，</p>
<p>摩挲殘損了的碑銘，讀不出長眠者底姓氏。</p>
<p>叢叢蔓草遮蓋了這高低不平的土堆，</p>
<p>知道這亡過了的旅人久已沒有誰來理會！</p>
<p>此地是寂寞的鄉村之外的寂寞的荒郊，</p>
<p>卽使尙有人烟，也還離得很遠；</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>突然由黃　來一封從異國寄來底霞的信。</p>
<p>四年了，多麽悠遠的四年的光陰啊！</p>
<p>關於霞的消息我一點也不知道，同樣的我底踪跡霞何嘗曉得呢？</p>
<p>是啊，四年來我們已經音信杳然了。</p>
<p>總之，自從「九一八」與「一二八」戰爭爆發之後，我們之間的愛底關係已經斷了，被砲火毀滅了。卽無情的砲火已經把我們當時種種的幻想打破了，粉碎了，消滅了。</p>
<p>就從那時期起，我們的思想，感情也跟着當時的環境起了極大的變化了。</p>
<p>在那時，我們各人是有各人自己的主張的。而彼此對於生活的認識又不同，見解亦是兩樣，所以我們終於無法融合了。</p>
<p>霞為了愛，所以他是很自私的，樣樣的事情都是從自己本身着想。我呢，說為了愛不如說為了理想，所以對於霞的個人主義的觀念常然是難於接近的。</p>
<p>可是，霞的個性是非常的頑固的，她想從我的複雜的生活裏把我拖進她那單純而溫柔底桃色生活之中。</p>
<p>這是怎樣可能哩！為了愛，我可以出賣自己的人格，靈魂和光榮的理想嗎？如果眞是需要這樣的話，那末我祇好犧牲了「愛」。</p>
<p>「愛」我想：該是推動人生的吧。「愛」是入類一種結合的力量。這種結合的力量，牠不是為了自己的幸福打算。「愛」，證種力量，牠是毀滅殘惡與黑暗的一種力量，創造偉大的光明的人生之一種力量！</p>
<p>因此，我感到霞對於我的愛是暗淡的，灰色的，微弱的，無意義的。所以我們之間的愛終於破裂了，消滅了</p>
<p>是這樣，從激烈的血戰中，我們的生命分離了。霞，於是傷心地走了。霞，於是傷心而憤懣　回到她那遼遠地被敵人蹂躪下的異國之家去了。從此，永別了，會經熱愛過我的霞啊！</p>
<p>在當時，臨別的一剎那之間，雖則我的心曾經感到萬分的酸痛。我相信，從此，霞和我永遠沒有見面的日子了。</p>
<p>這事情，與其說我們是失戀的不如說失意。與其說失敗不如說成功。因為——我們都是為着自己的前途而離散，决裂，鬥爭啊。</p>
<p>總之，就從戰爭那一年起，霞的印像不復銘刻在我的腦海里去，而我的影子自然也不會存在在霞的心中了。現實而殘酷的戰爭已經把我們的生命分化了。從此以後，四年了啊，我不復知道霞的消息了。反正，霞也毌需知道我一樣。</p>
<p>是的，四年了，多麽悠長的光陰啊。我是孤獨地生活着。但集體的鬥爭，工作，使我强壯而愉快，我沒有感到寂寞的悲哀，也不會因為這求愛而苦惱。</p>
<p>偉大的，無窮的人間底愛，牠比之於那個人的渺微的「愛」，不是光榮而幸福得多嗎？</p>
<p>四年了，多麼悠長的光陰啊。然而我仍舊一樣地活着。不斷地向着險惡的人生之路邁進。雖則在這時間，我是受過許多的挫折，碰過不少的釘子。可是，我的心沒有死，我的心還是熊熊地燃燒着鬥爭的火燄。</p>
<p>但，霞呢，現在怎樣了？現在雖則接到霞這封突然的來價。然而霞什麽也沒有吿訴我。不過，在霞這封簡單的信裏，隱的地我巳經體味到體的悲哀了。她雖則沒有顯明地表示出來，然而在這對信的字裏行間，我已經看出霞的斑斑的淚痕了。難道對於她目前那種奢侈的，頽唐的，墮落而無趣的太太底生活，已經厭惡了嗎？已經覺悟過來嗎？</p>
<p>四年了，多麼悠長的光陰啊。我們彼此所走的門徑絕然相反，而且愈走愈遠了。我們已經成為旅途上的陌生者了，甚至我們已經成為不可對立的敵人了。</p>
<p>現在，我想回答霞的，給她瞭解的，是我——</p>
<p>「這個人，曾經也熱愛你的琳，他始終沒有改變自己的主張，動搖過自己的信仰。他還是和過去一樣——站在爭求民族的解放和自由底戰綫上，奮鬥着而至臨到最後的一息！」</p>

<p>— 櫻子</p>
<p>呵！十年的日子過得多麼快！在這城市裏，我從小孩子很快地長成「大人」了。小孩子時候的記憶大抵是眞確的，我會記憶着這城市怎樣從頹敗，廢墟中生長起來，我差不多一眼，一眼看到它怎樣的慢慢從衰落，荒凉的境地中繁榮起來，新式的建築是漸漸多起來了，馬路是寬廣了，連空蕩蕩的新舊城大馬路兩傍也修築起不少的新式工廠，房子來。電燈明幌幌地照耀着，這草原中黃　昏時的大城市，霓紅燈和着那嘩拉嘩拉的廣播收音機在塞外的夜的街頭閃爍着。人們的生活也隨着慢慢在改變了，只是那不景氣還深深地籠罩着這城市，人肉的市塲是一天一天地在「擴大」了，那些隨着這城市成長起來的小市民們的生活，除卻了糜爛外什麽都談不上。</p>
<p>看過了這，我一個年靑人卻又看見了另一種景象，這一次是要將整個地塞外草原和城市會變成了「王道樂土」的吧？</p>
<p>拖着紅球尾巴的飛機也給草原上的人們多加了一番見識，看得熟慣了。照例的，聲乎是每天總有一兩架在靑靑天空上盤旋。衝過了淸冽的空氣，發出的嗡，嗡的響聲，擾亂着每一個人的視聲。從這視聽裏人們也都聽出了自己的「命運」，只是不知道人家幾時會下蛋，心裏時常在咕嚕着：「該不會下蛋吧？」</p>
<p>隨着這而來的是飄揚的紅球的白色旗，它像要刺穿着每一個年靑人底心，那下面是一個名目為公館的廣大的院落，那裏面究竟玩着什麼把戲，有誰知道呢！松田公館」「××公館」也在大街小巷隨處顯現着，這裏什麼時候成為「人家」的居留區域呢？</p>
<p>塞外草原和這一個沙漠中的大城市是在漸漸變了，它要變得我會認不得它本來的面目吧？而今，我卻要離開它了，這個生我長我而又在此地生活過十多年的城市！</p>
<p>憶想着平日聽慣看慣而不起感觸的：冬日大靑山頭白皚皚的積雪，一串串響過去的鼕，鼕，駝鈴聲，靑靑草原上吃草的咩咩的羊羣，還有那在黃昏時天空上悲號淸成千成萬的烏鴉……這時候對於我都是異常地親切而又感覺到眷戀的了。</p>
<p>塞外的友朋們呀，我預先祝福你們再見時：「別來無恙」！</p>
<p>這該不會成為空幻的夢想吧？</p>
<p>這一次我才眞眞實實地感到「離情」之苦了。（完）</p>

<p>報載行政院蔣院長壽辰，為國歷十月二十九日，本年恭值五十大慶院長主張節約運動，以此舉不必舖張，各機關長官是日僅用函柬或代電申賀不送禮物云：蔣院長痼瘉在抱，謙遜為懷，高山景行，聞者可以與矣。</p>
<p>蔣院長為黨國領袖，勞苦功高，全國民衆，於熱烈擁護之餘，久有購機祝壽之舉。此事關係國防，又當別諭，至贈送禮物，既奉諭停止，自應遵照。惟全國民衆及各機關長官，是日僅用函東或代電申賀，以我國幅員之潦闊，郵遞之需時，時間上恐有不及，或過時之虞，欲　補救辦法，惟有拍發交際電報是已。</p>
<p>查交際電報之用途，雖不止一端，而其意義，實倣行國際通行之賀電辦法。試觀歐美民衆，每逢國家元首之誔辰，大都均發賀電，共申慶祝。是日電局加班工作，忙碌不休，各方賀電，似雪片飛來，情緒熱烈，足見一斑。交通部創行交際電報，定價特為低廉，以便公衆通訊，胥為最適宜之慶祝辦法。</p>
<p>况蔣院長為國宣勞，遠在各國元首之上，凡我民衆，應於是日無論遠近，無論個人或團體，均　拍發交際賀電一通，一則表示擁護之誠，一則提倡節約之道，且時間經濟，手續簡單，意義隆重，辦法新頴，全國電局，均可拍發，愛國之士，當必樂於採用也。</p>

<p>— 遠明</p>
<p>在變幻莫測的國際商塲上角逐，而想出奇制勝，固然須具備超越的眼光，堅毅的魄力，和靈活的手腕，但是「消息靈通」，畢竟也是致勝的要素。像行情上落，來源狀况，銷路呆滯，或暢旺各方面，都要知道得快，並且要瞭如指掌，然後决定策略，迅赴時機，否則稍一遲緩，便被他人捷足先登，所以消息的遲速，在商塲中，是足以左右成敗的。欲求消息靈通，厥維通訊工具的利用得法，——就是探得商情以後，利用最快的通訊方法，傳遞回來，現在國際間最快的通訊，要算「電報」。可是傳遞電報的電路很多，快慢不同，所以利用電報通訊，還須要明瞭電路的選擇。從我們中國發到世界各國的電報，目下最快最好的一條電路，是「國際無綫電路」，——「快」是選擇電路的目標，「好」是包括服務週到，和給予公衆種種便利的表現。</p>
<p>國際無綫電報的優點，為何而是最快咧？因為他和各國的大都市間，都是直達通報，用的又是最新式的高速度機器，當然其「快」無比。並且時時刻刻注意到內部工作的改善，最値得注意的，有兩點：（一）嚴密校對，——一張電報的電文底準確性，是最為重要，所以國際電台專派受遵訓練的人員，担任校對工作，每一張電報，收到或發出後，隨卽校對一遍，倘有錯誤，不等到收報人査詢，立卽通知更正，這於收發報人方面，有極大的利益，因為假如等到收發報人發覺後，再行査詢，畢竟是延擱時間的，所以實行後，電報非常正確，毫無錯誤。（二）提高轉報速率，——上海電報局國際電台間本裝有專錢，接轉國內各處發往國外的電報，後來為更求快速起見，裝置複鑿機多部，使得各大局的國際電報，能够直接傳遞到國際電台。此項辦法，實行以來，電報傳遞的速率，更為增加不少了！此外如限制報差送到時刻，實行電話傳遞電報，都是與提高電報速率有關的。</p>
<p>所以經營國際貿易的商行，如果拍發國際電報，只要，註明經無綫電或Via　Cgra，一定會得到充分的滿意。在已經採用國際無綫電報的商行們，實際感覺到種種便利，當然相信我言不謬。在未經採用國際無綫電報的商行們，必定也希望電報傳遞迅速，儘可實騐記者所言是否確實？而且國際無綫電，是我國國營的新興事業，凡我國民，都應該擁護牠，採用牠，使得牠更形發達，何况牠所給你的報酬，又是分外迅速和服務週到種種便利呢？</p>
<p>我們知道：通訊事業越發達，通訊效率，越能改進；通訊方法，越能便利，通訊方法越便利，轉能促進國際貿易的繁榮。所以從事國際貿易家，為事業計，為愛國計，都不能不從大處着想，而一致地起來擁護這新興的國營事業，和電局密切的合作，共同促進國家經濟的復興。</p>
<h3 id="c198">國際電報價目問題 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>國際電報價目之規定，共成因頗為複雜。各國之國際電報價目互有高下，至為參差不齊，有距離相同而報價懸殊者，有金法郞價目相近，而各國折收本國貨幣之價値相去共遠者，原難一槪而論。我國現行國際電報價目，並非完全以距離為標準，惟距離究不失為規定國際電報價目之一種重要因素而已。</p>
<p>各國計算國際電報距離，因沿革關係，均以錢路途程為標準，不以空問距離為標準。例如我國至美國之電報錢路，係先經菲列濱或日本，故中美間報價應較菲美間日美問報價為高。此次上海市商會等團體以小呂宋至美國，及日本至美國之空間距離曁報價與中國至美國之空問距離曁報價相比，遽謂中美間報價較昂，實係未明上述原理所致。且小呂宋僅為菲律濱羣島之一埠，而日本亦僅為遠東多數國家中之一國。如欲將中國發往美國之電報價目與他國發往美國者相比，似宜將遠東重要各國發往美國之報價一併比較，方可明瞭全盤之眞相。茲列表比較如下：</p>
<p>往來地名　子午線　字金法郎價目　與中美間價目比較</p>
<p>中國——舊金山　三·七五</p>
<p>香港——舊金山（英國屬地）　三·七五　相等</p>
<p>澳門——舊金山（葡萄牙屬地）　四·一五　高〇·四〇</p>
<p>越南——舊金山　三·九九　高〇·二四</p>
<p>馬來聯邦及海峽殖民地——舊金山　四·三五　高〇·六〇</p>
<p>——舊金山　三·七五　相等</p>
<p>東印度——舊金山　四·三五　高〇·六〇</p>
<p>印度——舊金山　三·二五　低〇·五〇</p>
<p>日本——舊金山　三·〇五　低〇·七〇</p>
<p>菲律賓——舊金山</p>
<p>由小呂宋發出者　二·六五　低一·一〇</p>
<p>由呂宋島發出者　二·九〇　低〇·八五</p>
<p>其他各島發出者　三·五五　低〇·二〇</p>
<p>（按各國發至中國電報均以發至上海者為基本報價，其發至上海以外各地須另加本錢費。各國發至美國電報，均以發至舊金山者為基本報價，舊金山以外各地亦須另加本綫費，故上表均以發至舊金山者為標準）</p>
<p>自上表觀之，遠束各國發往美國之電報價目，有與中國發往美國之電報價目相等者，有較中國為高者，有較中國為低者，中美間電報價目殊不能謂為獨昂也。又我國交通部與美國無綫電交通公司及大東大北等電報公司，均訂有關於傳遞電報及收費等事項之報務合同，以資共同遵守。關於電報價目之增减，雖可由任何一方提出討論，但他方同意與否，仍須視理由是否充分及事實是否需要方可詳加考慮協商决定也。</p>
<p>上海市商會及中美貿易協會等四團體所謂試以一百字之電報一通，自上海發往舊金山，再由舊金山將原電發回上海，其間折中國國幣，上海方面須多付一百十餘元，可見我國國際電報報費之匯兌折合率亦較昂貴一節，事實上亦不盡然。蓋中美間往來電報之金法郞報價，雙方原屬相等，上項差額實因美國採取特殊貨幣政策所致，故欲求調整上項差額，其權亦操於美國而不操於我國也。按照目前情形，美金價値愈低或世界銀價愈高，所有中美間往來電報，在中國方面所付國幣數値與在美國方面所付國幣等値之差額亦愈大。現在黃國旣採特殊貨幣政策，同時又握操縱世界銀價之權威，故未來趨勢，恐將使上項差額，有增無减。例如按照目前我國外匯法定價格，我國如欲使中美報價之國幣數値相等，須將現行之金法郞折合率减百分之四十一左右（卽每一金法郞合六角七分）但美國購齦法案規定，銀價得提高至每盎同値美金一元角九分（現時祇値美金四角五分左右），此事如果實現，倘我國之外匯法定價格，仍能維持不變，則我國之金法郞折合率，須照現行價率减低百分之七十九（每一金法郞合二角三分五厘），方可使中美報價之國幣數値相等。如美國將來再貶低其貨幣價値，則我國之金法郞折合率，又須再减。如此辦理，豈非使我國之金法郞折合率，不以中國之外匯法定價格為依歸，而隨美國之貨幣政第為轉移耶　總之，美國現行之金法郞折合率與金法郞之眞正價値並不相等，所謂特殊貨幣政策是也。此項特貨幣政策，如不變更，則世界各國與美國往來電報，恐皆不取報費，故所定金法郎折合國幣價率，不能僅對發往某國或某一電路之電報適用。我國如將金法郞折合率减低，則對於發往世界各國電報之國幣價目，均須一律减低。惟我國結付各外國電報公司（無綫或水綫）之報費，因受國際電信公約及我國與各國所訂報務合同之束轉，均須仍按金法郞之十足價値計算，如此辦理，我國電政經濟方面須受重大損失，殊非目前財力所能許可。</p>
<p>國際貿易愈發達，則國際間往來電報愈多，此係一定之理。同時國際電報又為經營國際貿易所必需之通信工具，故减低電報價目雖可促進國際貿易，然此種力量，殊難確定。試說明如次，中美間之國際貿易，若增加百分之五十，則電報業務或可增加百分之五十。倘將中美間報價减低百分之五十，則中美間</p>
<p>我國電報雖為國營事業，但無國庫補助，故不能不兼顧經濟方面之收支平衡。假定中美間報價减低百分之五十後，中美間貿易亦能增加百分之五十，因此而使中美間歸報業務亦隨之增加百分之五十，則他價雖减而報費收入因業務發達之結果，或可不至如何减少。然國際電報價目减低後，促進國際貿易之效果旣難確定，則電報業務究能增加若干，殊無把握，而我國之國際電報報費收入，則勢必减少甚鉅，不僅使我國電政經濟增加困難，抑且為各外國水錢電報及無綫電報公司所難同意。</p>
<p>依據上述種種原因，我國現行之金法郞折合率旣與金法郎之匯兌價率相近，一時實無須輕易變更，則國際電報價目亦殊難驟予减低，其由至為明　當為各界所鑒諒也。</p>

<p>以社會主義稱雄于全球的蘇聯和着正在加速貫澈其軍國主義的德國，他們倆在國際上形成着二個極端的對立。可是，儘管是寃家對頭，卻常常會採取類似的一致動作。</p>
<p>譬如是最近罷，蘇聯設立了最高政府機關，聘請科學的專門人員十萬人，作進一步改革社會環境的工程。那裏面有七千餘醫藥專家，都是受過最高的醫學敎育的碩彥名流，而且大半為醫科大學的各科敎授，專任担負抗淋的工作。</p>

<p>— 美國Dr．Norden著　留俄楊道南醫師譯</p>
<p>睪丸精所含特異物質能鼓舞生命　精液耗喪　經和肌肉機能必被毀</p>
<p>嚇！精液不但是生殖的本源，而且含有一種有力的物質，足以鼓舞全身的肌肉和神經系的機能。法國大醫學家勃郞舍加耳氏，由年靑動物睪丸中採出呌做斯頒而馬丁（Spermain）的汁液，注射人體，便覺筋力旺盛，活氣增加，營養增進。證明人類的精液，同樣含有這樣的成分。若參照手淫者傷耗過多的精液，便見面黃肌瘦，疲倦無神，發育不良，性器短小；加以遺精的磨折，縱能苟延生命，也是不能結婚的，因為婚後的早洩陰委，痛苦太大。於此，足見斯頒而馬丁對神經和肌肉影響之重要了</p>
<p>西班牙性病專家Lumber氏證實，「耐而斯遺精片」為治止遺精手淫最對症良藥，因其獨含斯頒而馬丁，故遺精病性能頽弱服之最效，至于神經衰弱陰萎早洩，則宜兼服「補體康」。</p>

<p>人們的腸胃因為是容納各種食物的器官，終日操勞小息，所以也就最易于出毛病。</p>
<p>這種毛病起初多不顯着，多呈食慾减退，或見飯生畏；可是十九皆釀成消化不良症，胃部有壓重感，胸部灼熱刺痛，得食則脹疼等情，有的就成為猛烈的胃痛，每致人事不省。當然，胃痛不是市上一些麻醉胃藥所能奏效的，依德國Havelock實騐以服「强胃精」為首。</p>
<p>但是胃腸障碍一方也有不起胃痛的，卻發生嘔吐噁心，噯氣噎酸等現象，痛苦非常！德國「强胃精」的好處，就在能够掃除這類複雜症候。而且這藥的特點，還能除口臭多唾。又善療治大便秘結，屁多症。並因含維他命B，尤善治脚氣</p>

<p>……打破以前虛玄空論，　……歸到實際上的效能。</p>
<p>醫學是一種實際上的科學，不務玄言，尤其是淋病如此，蓋淋病一症，牠是一刻萬變的，不能單在紙上空談，　來醫家對於淋病問題，研究者雖多，而實際有效療法，卻是少見。但是科學終不畏難解之謎的。自從德國彼得氏發明了「克淋儂」一樂，這種發明可嘉的情形，一如艾利氏發明「六〇六」一樣。原來「克淋儂」是用一種純凈無瑕的黃色素和蛋白體之混合製劑，牠的功效，凡服了「克淋儂」後，全體的細胞，發生抗淋　菌的總動員，把所有淋病四面包圍而盡殱殺之，但其他健全部份，却絕對沒有損傷，這真是脚踏實地療法，也是在何白濁藥所不及的地方。</p>
<p>澳大利著名的花柳病錫四們說：曾用「克淋儂」治愈一位年約廿五六歲的爵士公子，他患淋毒性攝護腺炎已近五年了仍是沒有治好，後來經我治療，用「克淋儂」為內服藥，即大著功效。凡小便困難淋系痛楚，都完全治愈了。更進而用刺戟和騐血等檢査，都證明根治。一時哄動整個醫林。（譯者按：此事我在俄國勞働大學醫科畢業後，在歸國途中的赤塔時，即已聞知。）</p>

<p>戒除煙毒，非單方而培補所能奏效，必須旺盤全身荷雨蒙和蛋黃素，才能安全戒絕，德國梅倫博士根據此理，發明荷爾蒙蛋黃素劑「補體康」和女用「補女容」，為男女戒烟特效品，服後能確實無痛苦斷　，</p>

<p>自從這個學說被瑞士徒梅博士（肺病專家）發見後，各國肺病治療界莫不奉為圭臬。像荷蘭肺病醫院主任醫師Feldmann　M．D　及英國結核病療養院院長Dr．Wa　kfoff　與巴黎肺病療治所所長Daguette等博士之實騐，都證明徒梅氏的肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，不但有增殖結締細胞，防止癆茵向外發展之功；且能收縮肺弛緩，使其安靜。故有止水止血，清除厚痰同，消滅胸痛的偉效！肺即安靜，結核毒素即不致流人血中，而潮熱盜汗，諸恙　然；食增體健矣！如兼有神經衰弱，失眠頭痛，男子遺精，女子月經不調等，除服「補肺拿爾」外，宜兼服男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」以堵衰弱，好起來更較快連，大約一二月即愈。</p>

<h3 id="c214">華中運動會的糾紛 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>當我們從報上看到華中四省（皖·湘·鄂·贛）的運動會大規模舉行的新聞不久，很遺憾地卻又在報端上，發現了那差不多成為規例，每回運動會必有的糾紛了。這次的糾紛又是這樣像一個公式裏製造出來的一樣，（據本報十四日體育消息版載）最先是因為在萬咪賽時，鄂隊遲到，被取消資格。鄂隊不服，幷當塲毆傷皖省萬咪選手黃遠樹，擾亂會塲秩序。最後，聽說巳經湘省主席何鍵調解，由鄂代表向大會引咎，聲明帶隊同鄂，除向皖隊道歉，幷懲辦行兇者，才算了卻這一筆運動官司。</p>
<p>雖然，這筆官司算是和平解决，而且解决得也頗迅速和順利，沒有節外生枝。不過，從這糾紛中，我們更可以看到運動塲裏各方面的秘密了。換一句話說，更足以證明現在中國的所謂體育明星的制度，到底只是體育覺達的一個很大的阻碍。在中國奧林匹克選手從柏林吃鴨蛋歸來以後，這又是一個很好的敎訓了。同時，也是給予堅持體育明星制度的一個很好的答覆</p>
<p>現在，我們試來分析這糾紛的是非罷。</p>
<p>本來，像這樣的運動官司，是很常看見，也差不多是每一回運動會中常有的節目。當然，在運動員方面，是完全喪失體育原理，和沒理性的表現。不守時間而至遲到，被取消資格是很公平的裁判，也沒有不服的理由。便作為是眞的不服裁判，也只能作書面的抗議，提到會塲的裁判委員會上去。只表示不服，而不提抗議，這是不明白規則，還可原諒；至於不但不遵守規則，反而故意擾亂秩序，甚而至毆傷別省選手，這便無可原諒了。同時，還得特別指出，被害的黃遠樹是本屆萬咪的冠軍，（據本報長沙十二日電）那麽，更可證明鄂省選手的沒理性。這是無可疑義的，同時也是應該嚴厲懲治的。</p>
<p>不過，我們也不能把全副責任放在運動員的身上。運動員沒理性的違法舉動，雖然是他們本身的謬誤，不過，他們之所以如此，最少指導他們的人，和傳統的從事體育運動的錯誤觀念——體育明星的制度，也應該負一大半的責任的。體育只為造就體育明星，而不能普及到民衆去，這我們在這裏暫時不去說他，單是為了養成一般從事運動的入的錦標觀念，至發生像此决的無理性的糾紛來看，我們也不能替這種體育明星制度加以辯護的了。</p>
<p>如果體育還是狹隘地只為了造就幾個傑出的人材，替團體，替學校，替國家爭錦標，那末中國的體育一天還是和鬥牛塲一樣只是娛樂，和製造糾紛罷了。</p>

<p>— 錫山</p>
<p>（本報特稿）農村改進的聲浪，年來已遍及了全國各地，而切實辦法，具體步驟，大都仍在試辦程中，本市高橋區的農村改進會，卻已開始了實施的工作，其組織的目的，是希冀建成一個自治組織的健全單位，在市政的指導之下，成為全市最模範的一個農區，自創辦以來，已有三年的歷史，當初創時，報已故總理史量才先生亦曾予該會極大之帮助。昨日，我特走訪於該會，承幹張君招待，頗詳細的述明了該會內部的一切組織，及工作的實施情况：</p>
<p>改進會服務的區域，包括高橋及高行二區，合計有村落三百三十八個，戶口六千六百八十三戶。二區人民工作的範圍，包括農作，蓄牧及漁業三種，故該會在組織上亦頗廣大，係從（一）經濟，（二）自治，（三）敎育，（四）衛生，（五）農事，（六）工藝等數方面進行。服務人員的數十餘，分派於各區，總幹事為王揆生君，當創辦時，經費係由當地各熱心公共事業者捐助，其後規定經常費第一期每月七百元，第二期五百五十元，第三期四百元，包括薪金，伙食及辦公費，目下因已達第二期，故經常費每月已减至五百五十元，據張君所吿：開支因限於經費，雖不能充裕，然依預算規定，尙差可過去。</p>
<p>該會於農村經濟的行政方面，組有生產互助社及合作社：（一）生產互助社之設立，目的在救濟農民之經濟恐慌，蓋欲使農民不致因無資而停止生產。放欵的資金方面，係與上海銀行的農業部合作，總會及分區共設三十二社，互助社員每組至少五人，而負連帶償還的責任，對於放欵的用途及數目，皆予以極嚴密之調査，以適應借戶最低的需要為標準，據張君所述：如種田五畝，每畝酌合施肥須一元五角及雇工水合一元，則借予十元，在手續上，借戶須先申請登記，隨卽派員調査，如無欺朦情事，卽予放欵。（二）合作社之組織，包括產品合作運銷及農用品之購買，並推廣優良棉種，曾與中央大學楊思棉塲合作，推廣江陰白籽棉二五〇〇公斤，結果尙佳。</p>
<p>自治方面，該會將改進區劃成九個分區進行分區的自治組織，在民衆方面，除保衛團及業餘軍訓班外，各分會另產生靑年服務團，其組織的計劃，分成三個時期，第一為聯絡期，第二為訓練期，包括文字研究，職業指導，學術講演及保衛訓練等，最後為服務期其服務範圍目下進行者，有識字學校，衛生宣傳及家政改良等。</p>
<p>該會在敎育方面的工作，亦頗完備。在高橋的新港宅設立懿德小學，一切敎育工作，以此為集中推動點，其工作情况分有：（一）民衆圖書館，備有書藉二千餘冊，雜誌一千〇五冊，館內設有書揷巡廻文庫及敎育普及車。並附帶陳列農作標作標本，供民衆瀏覽。（二）男子夜校，設於該會的新港辦事處，據吿：學生程度已達小學三四年級之上，故目下已授尺牘·珠算·英語等課程。（三）婦女夜校，設於懿德小學，由該區女職員主持，學生有七十人，科本是採用上海市頒行的平民識字敎本，（四）開辦小先生訓練班，分赴區內各宅敎授識字，現已結束，畢業的小先生有十數人，（五）特約茶園九所，編貼民衆壁報，包括國際，國內及本市消息三項，我曾赴附近西街的一家茶園去參觀，見壁報所採集的消息撮要而簡明，字體整而大，很便於閱讀，並且該處更附設着一個問字代筆處，使農民减少文字上的困難程度。</p>
<p>農事的實施工作，該會劃定特約農田，與農民合作，予以優良的品種，及指導耕種方法，使農民可獲得美滿的收穫，並按時舉行農事展覽會，採集標本及掛圖，用種種引證方法，促農民改良和研究。張君又述及前曾設立示範農塲，播種小麥，靑菜及橄欖菜，試騐其是否適合於本地土壤的種殖，現已試辦完畢，目下在進行中的是籌備設立農村軋花廠及戽水合作社。</p>
<p>改進區內的衛生工作，係由高橋衛生事務所帮同服務，除調査死亡，疾病之槪况外，向農民宣傳家庭淸潔及衛生常識。在醫務上，設立民衆診療所。免費為農民診治，並時有衛生及拒毒運動的舉行。</p>
<p>工藝的訓練，有婦女刺繡班，因高橋一區，歸女對於刺繡是主要的副業，但技術太壞，致作品太劣，無人問津，故該會特開班訓練，設法改良，據云第一屆畢業者，有四十餘人，其次更設立鄉村工藝社，因年來市而蕭條，工商失敗，農村靑年都苦無出路，在此情况之下，該會又提倡農村工藝，由施某主任，招生練習六個月畢業，初期出品為藤</p>

<p>月亮像一柄鐮刀似的掛在天的西邊，沒有一顆星星，巡望樓上已打過了五更，在這寒氣逼人的黎明時候，城墻上突然有一條黑影射箭那樣地飛過。巡望樓上的守望兵偶然抬起頭來瞥了一眼，但是那條黑影已敏捷地爬過了城牙齒，彷彿一頭猴子，一個翻身逃過了高高的城墻，跌在墻脚下的草堆里。</p>
<p>這里已經近北關了，是一片沒有人跡的曠野，荆棘野草像高粱桿子似的高過半個人。那條黑影佝僂着身體，兩支手當做槳一般去擘折面前的野草，他是那樣忽忙，沒有顧慮到他的手上，脚上，或者身體那部份被荆棘刺破了皮膚，或許已經流着涔涔的血漬了。他要在最短的時間內逃過這片曠野，到達北關外面的碼頭上，碼頭上有着開往束西南北的小火輪，他祗要趕上一個船，他就是個自由的身體了。（未完）</p>

<p>春雲入夢最多情。警幻仙姑塵世臨。金釵十二同相叙。大觀園裏鬥娉婷。怡紅院。稻香村。省親別墅造來精。妙玉修行庵裏住。飄然仙子賽蓬瀛。何故為人稱檻外。沁芳閘畔流水淸。落英猶恐遭踐踏。黛玉多情花塚尋。巧遇怡紅佳公子。呆呆執卷暗沉吟。會眞記細閱中心動。愛煞鶯鶯羨張生。妃子瞥見難隱避。取來觀好半含嗔。假意欲行言稟吿，公子慇懃倍小心。二人留意情無限。彼此想思各有因。只怕你我胸懷不得心。</p>

<p>二十世紀福斯公司，今年曾傾其全力，攝成『精忠報國』Road　to　Glryo一片，在戰爭影片史上，建立了一個新紀錄，單說片中的三位主角吧，一個是茀德立馬區，一個是華納斐士德，再還有一個是里昂巴里摩亞，這三位明星，都是獨當一面的角色，現在合攝一片，當然是更有可觀了。再加本片的導演霍華豪克斯，又是一個專攝戰爭片的巨頭，所以本片的戰事場面，更較『西綫無戰事』為劇烈，聞中國領袖蔣委員長，慕該片之名，前特將該片運往廬山，親自觀看。該片不日將在本埠公映。</p>

<p>今晚在大光明獻映</p>
<p>華納公司最新出品的歷史航空鉅片『中國飛剪號』China　Clipper，已定於今（星期五）晚七時一刻起，在大光明公映了。該片係由潘德奧勃林，貝薇麗羅柏絲及羅斯亞立由大等十餘大明星所主演，描寫一班航空健兒的勇敢犧牲精神，在狂風暴雨的天空中，冒着生命的危險，去完成他們的志願。故事係根據不久以前所謂汎美航綫的『中國飛剪號』的長途飛行，其路綫係自靠近舊金山的太平洋海岸亞拉梅當起，至菲律賓羣島上，本片的宗旨，確能鼓勵冒險精神，激發進取思想，而演出的緊張激刺，更屬難能可貴，尤其是我們在高喊着『航空救國』的時候，對於這部影片，個個人部應該去欣賞一下。</p>

<p>岳楓君導演之『喜臨門』及『百響圖』兩片，均已先後完成，聞新光繼『小姊妹』後即映『喜臨門』片。</p>
<p>『喜臨門』為周　，馬陋芬，關宏達，秦桐，趙　娜，梁篤生諸大明星主演，劇中情節以揭破大家庭黑幕為題材，而滑稽發笑噱頭十足，全部幾十場戲場場會呌你笑痛肚皮，笑出眼淚。</p>
<p>『喜臨門』的劇本是黃嘉謨君手編的，據黃語人：是劇描寫鄉邨富室的荒淫恣肆，無惡不作，尤以色鬼的垂涎村女，詭計多端，笑話百出，真是合諷刺幽默，滑稽於一爐，觀是劇而不狂笑者，我不信也。</p>
<p>周璇為新華借去主演的『狂歡之夜』，輿論大佳，這次在『喜臨門』中，表演更見精彩，她扮的新娘子，半路上被人家來搶去，後來她去匿在　裏，會去悶死了為富不仁的老頭兒，真是曲折有趣，想入非非，此中奧妙，非待公映時看過，那就打不破這個悶葫蘆的。</p>

According to him, he accepted Song's invitation to serve as the Chairman of the Economic Commission and has discussed the issue of developing the North China economy with Song several times. Song has already drafted a general outline for economic development in his previous talks with Tashiro in Tianjin. Song has given simple instructions on the scope, and I will strive to proceed in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, coexistence, and co-prosperity externally, and maintain the interests of the people of North China internally, without losing rights or humiliating the country, so as to promote the economic development of the people. I have been out of political life for many years, and the situation in North China is special, so I feel more difficult to proceed with affairs than before. Currently, issues that need to be resolved, such as cotton planting and mining, should be started first. Other important issues, such as the construction of the Cangshi Road, will have to be gradually carried out after contacting all parties. I am scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 18th to visit the Japanese authorities to exchange views on the issue of economic development in order to formulate a concrete plan to move forward.

<p>Outline of Conscription and Labor Service Methods in Various Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>行政院頒布施行</p>
<p>Promulgated and Implemented by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan believes that there are still many areas for improvement in the handling of conscription and labor service in various localities. Therefore, it has formulated an outline of conscription and labor service methods for various provinces and cities for promulgation and implementation, with reference to past advantages and disadvantages and future needs. The main points are as follows: (1) The conscription and labor service undertakings in various provinces and cities should focus on self-defense, road construction, water conservancy, afforestation, and other projects. (2) All able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 45 must perform labor service for three to five days each year. However, those who are disabled and unable to work may be exempted. (3) When handling it, the local situation should be taken into account, and able-bodied men should be selected and dispatched in batches and by household on a rotational basis, with the principle of universal labor service. (4) Those who have jobs outside their place of origin should perform labor service in their place of residence. (5) The principle of conscription and labor service should be within 15 li of the residence of the service, and food and accommodation should be provided for those outside. (6) The period should be determined by the provincial and municipal governments in accordance with the local situation, making full use of the slack farming season and spare time, and reported for approval in advance. (7) Matters such as the collection, distribution, and repatriation of conscription should be handled in accordance with the principles of conscription. (8) The provincial and municipal governments should, in accordance with the central tasks of the original policy outline and the various matters stipulated in the conscription and labor service, consider the actual needs of various localities, delineate work areas, differentiate between urgency and importance, make proper plans, and pay attention to coordination to complete the tasks on schedule. (9) When carrying out the project, one month before the implementation, technical guidance personnel, supervisors, and various tools should be prepared. (10) The expenses should be minimized and included in the local budgets at all levels. (11) Three months before the implementation of conscription and labor service, the entire conscription and labor service plan and budget of the province and city, together with the plan charts of each project, should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval in accordance with this outline. (12) This outline will be implemented from the date of its promulgation. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>The Central Standing Committee Decides to Postpone the National Assembly, to be Convened Regularly After Representatives from Various Places are Elected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 23rd Standing Committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th. More than 20 people attended, including Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Ding Weifen, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Zhou Fo Hai, Fang Zhi, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong and Zhou Qigang. Feng Yuxiang chaired the meeting, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) Regarding the case of how to deal with the fact that various provinces and cities failed to complete the National Assembly elections according to the original schedule, it was resolved that the National Assembly should be postponed because the election of representatives to the National Assembly has not been completed on schedule and in accordance with the law. Once the representatives from all over the country are elected in accordance with the law, they will be convened regularly. (2) Passed the public burial of Wu Xingya and Xu Shaozhen. (3) Appointed Zheng Peng as the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Central Statistics Office. (4) Appointed Chen Bai as the Secretary of the Central Cultural Planning Committee. (5) Chen Guofu was elected as the chairman for the Central Memorial Week next Monday and reported. (6) Other routine cases. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee passed the postponement of the National Election on the 15th. According to Jiang Zuobin, whom reporters visited, only 17 provinces and cities reported the results of the preliminary election by the Double Ten Festival as originally scheduled. Some provinces and cities have not yet completed the oath registration of citizens. In view of the actual difficulties, the Central Government decided that it would be difficult to complete the elections by the original deadline, so it was decided to postpone them. This is neither a change of the previous agreement by the Central Government nor a request from various provinces. After the postponement, everything will proceed as usual, and the provinces and cities that have not yet completed the preliminary election will be urged to handle them in accordance with the law. After the preliminary elections in the provinces and cities are completed, the General Office of the National Election will submit a request to the Central Government for approval and send it back for the second election. According to my observation, it will take another three or four months to complete the election of representatives. The Central Government will then set the date of the meeting. The outside world's claim that the meeting will be postponed indefinitely is absolutely incorrect. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Central Committee said that the postponement of the National Assembly was decided by the Central Standing Committee due to actual needs. Since the establishment of the General Office of Elections, it has urged various provinces, cities, and professional groups to hold elections. Due to the vast territory and the lack of rapid local election organizations, only half of the regional and professional elections have been completed by the deadline of October 10 for the second election. Special elections are all pending. We must be cautious at the beginning. As for when the exhibition will be held, it will be determined by the speed of the election. At that time, the Central Standing Committee will make a decision based on the report submitted by the General Election Office. Whether the General Election Office will reduce the scope during the postponement of the conference will also be decided by the General Election Office after considering the situation and submitting it to the National Government for approval. The Central Standing Committee has not made a decision. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony of the Employment Training Class, Ding Weifen Reports on the Purpose and Process of Establishment, Weng Wenhao Reads the Admonition on Behalf of President Chiang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The opening ceremony of the Employment Training Class was held at the Central Political School at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Weng Wenhao, Ding Weifen, Wang Shijie, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Chen Shuren, Zhou Yawei, Chen Guofu, Lei Zhen, Zhang Lisheng, Liu Zhendong, and others, as representatives of President Chiang, as well as all the students and professors, totaling more than 400 people, attended. All faculty and students of the Central Political School and its four affiliated colleges attended the ceremony, totaling about 2,000 people. Ding Weifen presided over the ceremony and reported on the purpose of the establishment of the class and the preparation process. Weng Wenhao read the admonition on behalf of President Chiang, followed by Wang Shijie and Wu Dingchang giving admonitions. The ceremony ended with a group photo. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>The main idea of Wang Shijie's admonition is that the government is holding this class because it has seen two diseases in the lives of young people today: decadence and romance. Decadence is formed due to the lack of physical fitness and the inability to endure hardship, and romance is formed due to the lack of simplicity and heart rate. This class emphasizes physical training to promote physical health and spiritual training to improve living habits. I hope that all members will regard today's opening ceremony as the beginning of a new era in their new lives, so as not to fail the expectations of the country and society.</p>
<p>The main idea of Wu Dingchang's admonition is that at a time when national construction needs talents, there is unemployment. This is not only a loss for young people, but also a major loss for the government and society. The cause of national construction is progressing day by day, and those who are responsible for this advancement must first receive specialized training in order to be qualified. The purpose of this class is to be able to introduce and assign jobs to each member after graduation, so that everyone can make the best use of their talents. Only then can the mission of this class be said to be completed, otherwise young people will hardly be able to escape their responsibilities. I hope that everyone can abide by discipline, obey training, and complete the mission of this class. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Admonition</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Significance of Creation: The Essence of Education <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Employment Training Class held its opening ceremony at the Central Political School on the morning of the 15th. President Chiang's address, entitled "The Significance of the Establishment of the Employment Training Class and the Essence of Education," was read by Weng Wen. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In order to enable graduates of colleges and above throughout the country to engage in appropriate work and make the greatest possible contributions, the Central Government has specially prepared the Employment Training Class, affiliated with the Central Political School, which officially opens today. In this time of national crisis, gathering so many university and college graduates and providing them with job preparation training is a pioneering initiative by the government to directly address the problem of youth unemployment. The purpose is not only to solve the livelihoods of individual scholars. Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) will elaborate on the significance of the establishment of this class and the essence of education, to inform all students of this class. Learning in youth is for the ability to act in adulthood; learning is originally intended for practical application. If learning cannot be applied, it is a waste of effort for the individual and a loss and burden to society. It will be seen that the more scholars there are, the more idlers there will be, the more difficult people's lives will be, and the weaker and more incurable the country will be. Today, Chinese youth often find that their knowledge is useless and they are often unemployed. They use their knowledge inappropriately and achieve little success, eventually leading to the contradictory phenomenon of everyone seeking work and every job needing people. This not only exposes the defects of education but also evolves into a serious social problem. The state establishes education to cultivate talent. If there is learning, there must be application. If supply and demand are not balanced, both the public and private sectors will suffer losses. There are many reasons why so many intellectuals in our country are unemployed. For example, economic poverty and the failure of various industries to thrive, the lack of reform in governance and the failure to appoint the virtuous and capable, and social chaos and the inability to distinguish between talent and foolishness are all objective reasons why learning is useless. The state should do its best to find ways to eliminate these causes. However, observing the facts, those young people who are truly talented, intelligent, and have practical learning are ultimately few in number who are suppressed and wasted. And the demand for talent in emerging public and private undertakings is expanding daily, yet there is nowhere where it is not felt that truly suitable candidates are difficult to find. Therefore, defects in education and the lack of sound self-cultivation among young people are also undeniable facts. The mismatch between talent and career is a subjective reason that urgently needs to be remedied. As the saying goes, "To fail to teach the people to fight is to abandon them." The state establishes education to cultivate citizens and, when they become talented, to enable them to contribute their abilities to complement the workings of heaven and human affairs, so as to achieve the purpose of opening up things and completing tasks. This matter is no different from war. If the government cannot fulfill its educational responsibilities and allows young people who are unprepared and lack sound self-cultivation to lightly enter society, ending their lives in frustration and failure, how can it not be considered abandonment? Therefore, Zhongzheng has long regarded the relief of unemployed youth as the government's top priority, believing that China is striving for national rejuvenation, the need for talent is great, and the approach should be rapid. The government cannot sit idly by and watch the disconnect between manpower and career without seeking a prompt remedy. The fundamental solution is to seek practicality and application in education at all levels, while the short-term solution is to address the shortcomings of young people themselves, providing short-term special training to remedy the shortcomings of their past schooling, and then allocating them to jobs that suit their individual personalities, cultivating their interest in employment and service, and adding assessment and promotion, and guiding them to make the greatest contribution. Although the beginning is simple, the hope is great. This step will be followed and continued, so that all young people in the country can have learning that is useful, and application that is suitable for their learning, so that everyone has a job and every job gets the right person. The significance of the establishment of this class lies in this, and the fundamental essence of education in this class can also be stated: (1) Practical ability must be enhanced. The common ailment of today's youth is that they like to talk about empty theories and lack the ability to do practical work. They emphasize rigid knowledge and neglect practical learning. Even if they have special and profound attainments in theory and book knowledge, they rarely have a deep understanding of ordinary physical and human affairs, and how the subjects they have learned can be combined with practical things, nor do they bother to humbly study them. They only know how to observe the superficial appearance of everything, but cannot deeply examine its actual content, so that as soon as they leave the classroom, they feel lost, and when they encounter practical problems, they often feel at a loss. The education of this class is primarily to remedy this shortcoming. Although the time is short, it is essential to provide practical training to students in each subject, to thoroughly integrate what they have learned, and to guide them on how to apply it, so that their working ability can adapt to the actual situation of their employment. General training should focus on enriching common knowledge and understanding human affairs and the physical world. It should also emphasize the order of priority in all things, the methods of managing people and things, and the appropriateness of adapting to time and place, so that practical ability can be enhanced and what has been learned can be applied. (2) The concept of employment should be corrected. In addition to the problem of youth unemployment today, there is also the problem of being unable to settle down in a job. They compare the amount of compensation and treatment, and only seek work that is simple and easy. The prevailing trend is that even a few ambitious people cannot escape the pursuit of individual interests. This is a sign of national decline, and must be corrected first. People are born into a group, and who does not take the resources for food, clothing, education, and upbringing from society? To have received, one must give. Of the vastness of China, those who have received university or specialized education are very few. If these very few intellectuals are only concerned with their own well-being, who will shoulder the heavy responsibility for the prosperity and decline of the nation and society? Even in terms of personal achievement, one cannot establish a life without establishing a life of service and devote oneself to the distant and great. All the heroes and outstanding figures of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, who have achieved virtue and established careers and are immortal, have all taken the hunger and drowning of the world as their own responsibility, sacrificing themselves and serving the people, starting from the single thought of benefiting others. Yu the Great wore coarse clothes and ate poorly, exhausting himself for the sake of the world. Mozi rubbed his head and touched his heels, practicing frugality. Buddha said, "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell?" All of these are examples of embracing the great ambition of benefiting others and saving the world, and developing the spirit of service and sacrifice to complete their highest personality. Sun Yat-sen said, "Young people should aspire to do great things," and also said, "Life should be for the purpose of service." Zhongzheng has always adhered to Sun Yat-sen's teachings, explored the insights of past sages, and studied the true meaning of life, and has concluded that "the purpose of life is to improve the lives of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that succeeds the universe." I hope that all students in this class will understand the ultimate truth that righteousness and benefit are consistent, correct all selfish and self-serving concepts, and take saving the country and the world as the fundamental duty of scholars, so that entering the world to serve will have an active and upward interest, and there will be no worry of decline and waste. (3) The morality of service should be cultivated. The reason why public and private enterprises in our country are not prosperous is not only due to a lack of specialized talent, but also because those who are employed in general lack a deep understanding and habit of adhering to the morality of service. Therefore, the more people are employed by public and private institutions and organizations, the lower the efficiency. To mention the most obvious, such as respecting the system, obeying discipline, recognizing rights and responsibilities, cooperating and helping each other, and even cherishing public property, emphasizing timeliness, handling affairs meticulously, and being responsible in all matters, are all necessary conditions for the success of all undertakings. However, the more education today's youth receive, the farther their behavior and habits are from these service ethics. As a result, the general public regards employing knowledgeable youth as a difficult path, so how can it not create a large amount of unemployment? All of these phenomena have their social causes, but they are also a kind of defect in education that urgently needs to be remedied. Since this class is based on training and guidance for employment, the programs of service ethics must be clearly presented and students must be encouraged to practice them, so that those who are trained in this class will not be ashamed to be independent and striving members of the present era in any profession they take up in the future. They will be diligent and able to achieve something without supervision. The most important method for this training is to make the Twelve Rules of Conduct for Members of the Party the guiding principle, to show students the basics of dealing with the world and establishing themselves, and Zhongzheng's four words that he repeatedly reminds his comrades to "understand etiquette and righteousness, know integrity and shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline," he sincerely hopes that the students will be familiar with them throughout their lives, embody them and strive to practice them. Confucius said, "To act with shame is the beginning of responsibility." To know the sorrow of the weakness and poverty of the nation, all of which is due to the failure of the people to strive, then one must bravely take responsibility and think about how to save it. With this in mind to serve, then how can there be a moment of procrastination, with this ambition to work, then one must be able to endure hard work and not refuse complaints. This is also the highest standard of service ethics. (4) Daily life must be reformed. Any great undertaking starts from the ordinary. There is no one who can be promising if their daily life is not orderly, their habits are not pure and good, and their spirit is not invigorated. Today's youth often lead romantic lives, are infected with corruption, and are mentally depressed, resulting in weak bodies, fragile minds, and a failure to cultivate morality and careers. They are procrastinating and lazy, and they are afraid of difficulties and seek temporary peace, eventually leading to evil extravagance and self-abandonment. Such people, even if they have received higher education and have considerable talent and intelligence, will ultimately not be able to contribute to society and the country. In order to remedy this shortcoming, this class will strictly manage all aspects of students' daily life, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, without being annoyed by trivial details, so that students can regulate their bodies and minds through the orderliness of their lives, and develop a solemn and respectful attitude. Then, all external temptations will not be able to enter. No matter what kind of career they take up, they will be able to persevere to the end and achieve final success. I hope that all students in this class will be able to consciously govern themselves, work hard and strive, and strictly abide by the six principles of "neatness," "cleanliness," "simplicity," "diligence," "promptness," and "thoroughness" in all their living habits, actions, and attitudes, so that their lives can be "militarized" and productive, so as to establish the foundation for their future achievement of virtue and career. We must fundamentally recognize that life is war, so we should be cautious and fearful at all times, and make every effort to face the enemy as if in battle. In short, there must be a arduous struggle, and then there will be a complete success. The reform of daily life is the basis of all morality. (5) Revolutionary faith must be established. Youth who live in today's China must recognize the mission of the era they bear if they want to make achievements. What is the mission of this era? It is to build the country through revolution and revive the Chinese nation. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the highest guiding principles and the only bright road for our complete revolution and the restoration of the nation. Therefore, our faith is concentrated on this, our will should be unified on this, our spirit should be united by this, and our strength should be developed by this. Only then can we unite thousands of young people into one person, unite the aspirations of thousands of people into one, and jointly shoulder the great mission of reviving the Chinese nation. The students must know that "to annex the weak and attack the disunited, to take advantage of chaos and insult the perishing" has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so today. However, the cause of inviting insult must come from self-insult. There has never been a nation that was truly united and strong and ultimately insulted and destroyed by others. The emerging countries in the world at the beginning were not in distress and precarious, but only because their people could establish a revolutionary faith and, under the leadership of a single revolutionary doctrine and revolutionary government, struggled hard and never wavered, so that they could turn their country from danger to safety and from weakness to strength. With China's thick endowments, geographical advantages, cultural beauty, long history, and the greatness of the nation, if we do not destroy ourselves, who can destroy us? Once we are inspired, we will immediately revive. I hope that the students in this class will firmly believe in this belief, encourage themselves and encourage others, and the future of the country will be infinitely bright. (6) The spirit of self-reliance must be developed. There is one more most important meaning to tell the students, and that is self-reliance. The ancients discussed gentlemen, one said, "The gentleman strives for the root; when the root is established, the Way will come," another said, "The gentleman seeks in himself," and a third said, "Heaven's movement is ever vigorous; the gentleman strives for self-improvement without ceasing." The so-called "striving for the root" is self-cultivation. If a person can cultivate himself and illuminate his virtue, he can extend it to benefit the world, so it is said that "from the Son of Heaven to the common people, all regard self-cultivation as the root." If "the lazy cannot cultivate and the jealous fear others' cultivation," it is what the gentleman is most ashamed of. The so-called "seeking in oneself" is self-blame. The success or failure of a person's morality and career is all due to himself, and what can be relied on in the world is only oneself, so it is said, "Examine yourself first and blame others lightly," "Do not worry about not knowing, worry about not establishing," and "Do not ask about harvest, but ask about cultivation." The teachings of the past are all to encourage people to seek in themselves. "Striving for the root" is about things, "seeking in oneself" is about people, and the so-called "self-reliance" is about the fundamental spirit of these two. It is from this that the gentleman reflects on himself, inspires his will, cultivates virtue, and establishes a career. Only self-reliance has a positive and courageous spirit, only continuous efforts, only self-reliance has a great ambition of not admiring glory and profit, not greedy for enjoyment, not counting the gains and losses of the moment, and devoting oneself to achieving the greatest success in life. Zhongzheng sincerely hopes that the students will do their best to develop this spirit of "unceasing self-improvement," reflect on the progress or regress of their military morality and career at any time, strictly blame themselves, bravely renew themselves, and diligently cultivate themselves, so as to stand on their own feet and further establish others with self-reliance and save the country with self-rescue, then it will not only be the achievements of the students themselves, but also the benefit of the future of the country and society. The significance of the establishment of this class and the essence of education are roughly as described above. I hope that all the students who receive training will understand this meaning together, so that the education of this class can achieve a complete effect, and the students' morality and career will have the greatest success. When everyone does their best, the country will be revived. May the students strive! (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Far East Anglo-Japanese-American Triangular Relationship (Part 1) <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>—To be translated</p>
<p>Soviet renowned political commentator Kantorovich published some years ago an authoritative work on the Far East problem, entitled "America in the Struggle for China among the Great Powers". (America in the Struggle for China) His sources for reference are extensive. Besides the daily newspapers and magazine articles about the history of America's relationship with the Far East, he referred to a number of materials from the never before published archives left behind by the Czarist government. In the final chapters of this book he made an analysis on the modern international Far East situation. After its publication, the author published several essays one after the other in Soviet publications exploring the state of affairs in this area. An American writer, Harriet Moore, has summarized this research by Kantorovich and has written it as a note, and it was published in the September edition of the Pacific Affairs quarterly. From this we can know roughly the kind of analysis that the Soviet scholar is making about the current state of affairs in the Far East. We now translate Moore's notes below:</p>
<p>The current situation in the Pacific is being controlled by a triangular relationship in policy among the powers of England, Japan and America. Although other countries are also involved, their influence is either comparatively unimportant or has a fixed nature that can be seen as a constant in an equation. Japan's policy of using military and economic methods to expand outward is also fixed, however the direction and speed of this expansion cannot help but be affected by the actions of the other two powers. Therefore, the state of affairs in the Pacific is actually determined by the changes in British and American policy. The fundamental goals of British and American policy are not changing. Both countries want to protect their current Far East interests, including those in China, both countries want to at least determine a suitable share for their own country in the rights of priority that can be obtained in the future in the Far East in business and investment. However, the strategies adopted in order to reach these goals, as well as the pressure coming from the deployed troops, are changing.</p>
<p>In 1931-32, at the beginning of Japan's invasion of Manchuria, the effective pressure of England and America decreased to almost nothing. The Anglo-American union that had been suppressing Japan at the Washington Conference had already disintegrated. The world's economic panic, England's abandoning the gold standard and the war debt problem deepened the contradictions between the two countries and impeded the cooperation between the two countries on the Far East front line. England does not fear its formidable rival Japan all that much. Commercial competition is still limited to a small number of industries. England's anti-Soviet emotions are very strong, hoping that Japan's expansion could be seen as a means to weaken the Soviet Union, and could also be used as a fortress to defend China from "revolution." The British colonies in the Pacific mostly opposed anti-Japan action because their trade with Japan was increasing, and their interests in China were minuscule; if Japan was only moving north, they would not encounter direct danger from the progress of Japan's invasion. Therefore, the policy that England was practicing was to take advantage of Japan's actions in order to push forward with its own anti-Soviet and anti-American attempts. England was playing this game of putting Japan and America on a scale to see who was lighter and who was heavier.</p>
<p>At the same time, America was practicing its traditional plan: doing its best to use "moral pressure" to protect itself. The flourishing of Stimson's "non-recognition" doctrine, protesting Japan's actions, cooperation with the League of Nations in the Lytton Commission and in its later verbal opposition to Japan's expansion: these were the limits of America's actions. America had also fallen into an economic panic, and was concentrating its attention on that. Its military equipment was very sparse, and due to Hoover's economic plan, it was impossible to start on even the steps of improvement. America's unilateral moral pressure was clearly not very effective, it only obtained international non-recognition of Japan's new position, and delayed the problem. England was unwilling to help, America had not recognized the Soviet Union, and China, because America was still hoping that Nanjing would exert its strength, was not prepared to cooperate effectively in any way. Therefore, America endured a vexation caused by "on paper" opposing Japan, and did not receive any results.</p>
<p>In the following two years, following the changes in world affairs, the positions of the two countries shifted. England's feeling of fear towards Japan grew. The commercial war expanded to new markets and new categories of goods. The "interlude" in Shanghai, due to the temporary union of China, England and America, although was a defeat for Japan, also eliminated the illusion that England and its colonies had been holding, that Japan's attempts were only focused on Northern China. The abrogation of the Washington Treaty caused the world military arms competition to repeat itself. Due to the deepening aggressiveness shown by Germany in all aspects, and Italy's adventure in Abyssinia, the European situation became even more tense. The increasing strength of the Soviet Union gradually pushed England's anti-Soviet nature behind the scenes. That the Soviet Union was a great latent force in the aspect of European stability, and that England had to win it over, became the obvious situation. And because the Soviet Union had become stronger, Japan had lost the certainty of being able to attack the Soviet Union in the near future. Thereupon Japan turned southward, and was infringing upon England's genuine interests.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Shi Jianqiao's pardon order has not yet arrived in Tianjin. Officials say it is due to procedural matters and will take two weeks to arrive. On the 15th, a reporter visited Jianqiao in prison. She was wearing a grey cloth prison uniform with the number 108 sewn on the collar, and her face showed some worry. According to her, her cousin Dong Shaofang visited her this morning and showed her a newspaper report about the pardon. She felt quite surprised. She had already been sentenced to seven years by the High Court and had given up hope of being spared. She reads and writes every day, planning to spend these seven years in sorrow. Now, being pardoned, she feels lost and vulnerable. It is noted that Shi was sent to the court for detention on November 14th of last year, undergoing seven trials. She was sent to prison for execution on September 9th of this year, and has now been pardoned after only thirty-six days, which is completely unexpected. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Sino-British Credit Loan and the Use of Foreign Capital <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>We still remember June 21st. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic envoy to China, said while hosting reporters in Shanghai: British manufacturers and exporters should discuss with Chinese banks and government authorities about investing in credit to assist China in carrying out construction plans, so that China becomes increasingly prosperous, and the beneficiaries will not only be Britain, but all countries in the world will benefit. After Sir Frederick returned to his country, he actively campaigned in the British government and public circles based on this belief. After several months of efforts, the Sino-British credit loan agreement was finally established recently. Britain will lend China £10 million in credit, and China will be able to purchase large quantities of British goods under the guarantee of the British government. The method is the same as that stipulated in the British-Soviet Russian credit loan of £10 million in July of this year. The contents of the agreement have not yet been published, but the main points of the British-Soviet Russian commercial loan agreement established in July are: a term of ten years, an annual interest rate of 5.5%, and the issuance of loan certificates by the Soviet Russia to circulate in the London market, guaranteeing the repayment of the loan within a certain period. Taking this as an example, it is not difficult to see the outline of the agreement.</p>
<p>International credit loans are very common. The amount of this loan is not huge, but the process of its brewing has been more than a year. In March of last year, the British government proposed that, in accordance with the Nine-Power Treaty and the 1920 International Banking Consortium Agreement, countries should gather their strength to lend to China to assist in construction. This did not proceed due to Japanese opposition. In April, Britain proposed holding a conference in Nanjing to discuss China's monetary system, inviting representatives of banks from Japan, the United States, France, Belgium, and other countries to participate. This also failed to materialize due to Japan's disagreement. Later, Britain sent Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China to investigate China's economic situation. During this period, Sir Frederick went to Japan twice to propose joint investment in China to the Japanese authorities, but was still not accepted by Japan. Since Britain's proposal has been repeatedly rejected by Japan, it will naturally invest in China alone to implement its beliefs.</p>
<p>After the news of the establishment of the Sino-British credit loan came out, there was a violent reaction in Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed its ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, to investigate the truth and prepare countermeasures. Political figures also stated that although Japan did not want to oppose construction loans used to promote China's revitalization, any loans containing political nature that could disrupt the peace and tranquility of East Asia would not be ignored by Japan and would not be protested. We do not want to criticize this kind of view, but we hope to point out that Britain's motive for lending to China this time is that in recent years, Britain's market in China has felt a great threat, and recently, the flooding of smuggled goods in North China has harmed Britain's legitimate trade. In order to maintain its market in China and promote its surplus goods, it had to find another way. Lending to China is the way it has found. And China happened to be in a time of economic construction and was actively proceeding, and of course it was very in need of foreign credit loans.</p>
<p>The use of foreign capital, on the surface, has no so-called good or evil. Egypt used foreign capital and therefore perished. The Soviet Union used foreign capital, but therefore completed construction. The success or failure between them does not lie in the use of foreign capital itself, but in the method of using foreign capital. China has a history of using foreign capital for forty years. Most of it was not used in productive enterprises, and even if a small number was used in productive enterprises, the principles of equality and mutual benefit were not strictly adhered to. Therefore, not only did we not get the benefits of using foreign capital, but we lost many sovereign rights. Although the use of foreign capital has become China's inevitable destiny in the future, how to use foreign capital is exactly the question that should be considered at present. According to the current situation and past historical experience, we believe that the use of foreign capital should at least adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and be absolutely limited to the productive sector.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Signs of Policy Changes in Belgium <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Brussels) Political figures here explained the speech made by King Leopold II, saying that its purpose was to express that the country's diplomatic policy and international status will be changed. In the future, Belgium's situation will be the same as before the war. In other words, the tasks Belgium bears will only be limited to guaranteeing its own territory, and not maintaining alliances with other countries, so as to avoid promoting international conflicts. For this reason, Belgium does not want to maintain the Franco-Belgian alliance, nor does it want to participate in the new Locarno Conference. According to reports, the opinions put forward by the King in this speech have been revealed in the previous speeches of Prime Minister Zeeland and Foreign Minister Spaak, and public opinion has long been prepared. Finally, the King officially announced it. It is found that the Flemish nationality in Belgium has always advocated an independent policy in diplomacy, and this nationality has recently occupied a considerable force in politics, which is probably the reason for the sudden change in this country's diplomatic policy.

<h3 id="e52">The Belgian King Announces Neutrality, European Situation Changes Greatly, Belgium Decides to Strengthen Military Force to Defend Itself, Averting Being Drawn into the Vortex of War <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Brussels) The King presided over the plenary session of the cabinet today, which was his first since he ascended the throne on February 23, 1934. The King spoke at the meeting, advocating that the country restore its pre-war neutrality policy. It is said that this policy must firmly place Belgium outside the wars of its neighbors, and must have sufficient strength to defend Belgium from any war. The commendable actions of the Netherlands and Switzerland are worthy of emulation, and it is stated that this is solely for the purpose of protecting Belgium from any war that may occur, and that Belgium's army system must be reorganized. Belgium's current military organization is no longer able to cope with the new possibility of the enemy's rapid entry, and this shortcoming should be remedied urgently. According to a Reuters correspondent in Paris, French political circles were not surprised by the King's remarks. French Foreign Minister Daladier had a long talk with the Belgian ambassador yesterday, and the ambassador must have informed Daladier of Belgium's decision. However, everyone feels that this decision has far-reaching implications and will be related to any new Locarno agreement, and must be carefully studied before opinions can be expressed. Although the military staff departments of France and Belgium have closely cooperated to plan defense, the two countries have not signed a defense alliance. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The King's speech at the cabinet meeting, strongly advocating the restoration of Belgium's pre-war neutrality policy, has shocked the governments of European countries because this proposal has created a new political and military situation. Geneva regards this as a complete redefinition of Belgium's foreign policy. Although Belgium's remarks about the League of Nations should not be regarded as implying that Belgium's enthusiasm for supporting the League of Nations has weakened, everyone regards it as an obvious admission of the League of Nations' failure. There is also one thing that is particularly clear, that is, Belgium is no longer responsible for guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of other countries. The King's declaration is tantamount to cancelling the Locarno Pact and the Franco-Belgian military agreement of 1920. Everyone believes that Belgium is deeply afraid of the unpredictable changes in the Franco-Soviet Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, so it seeks to untie its guarantee on the Franco-German border. Now it is felt that a meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, namely Britain, Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy, is all the more necessary as soon as possible, but Belgium's current attitude will make it necessary to greatly modify the basis for discussion. The King's speech was like a bolt from the blue. French newspapers have made passionate cries because they all believe that it is enough to greatly damage the hope of establishing a new Locarno Pact. The famous French commentator Bertinaux said that Belgium has now erased itself in the security chapter of international affairs, and has freed itself from the shackles of international treaties without consulting any country. The general public's reaction to the King's speech is full of deep concern, because the Franco-Belgian alliance has long been an important factor in France's national defense preparations. Now, due to Belgium's actions, the Maginot Line must be extended from the Belgian border to the coast. Berlin is also paying close attention to the King's remarks. The Berlin Daily said that this is fundamentally related to Belgium's future diplomatic and military policies. In addition, there are no other comments yet. Paris said that even if this country strictly adheres to its new policy of neutrality and withdraws from the League of Nations, the obligation to allow any army to pass through the Belgian territory will still be valid for two years. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that, from the perspective of British and French security, Belgium's return to neutral status is a major blow to both countries. If Belgium strictly adheres to neutrality, then the talks between the staff departments of Britain, France, and Belgium under the new Locarno Pact will be impossible. If a war breaks out in Europe, British and French aircraft cannot fly over Belgium, otherwise it will obviously be a violation of Belgium's neutrality. Britain and France will also lose the benefit of using Belgian air force bases as a stable reconnaissance post in emergencies. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Belgian Cabinet Meeting Decides to Extend Military Service <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Brussels) The cabinet held a state meeting this morning, chaired by King Leopold III. It has been two and a half years since the King ascended the throne on, but today was the first time he chaired a state meeting. The government's draft military service bill was approved. This bill will be submitted for discussion at a special session of Parliament on the 27th of this month. Its content advocates that the term of service for infantry should be increased from sixteen months to eighteen months, and the term of service for artillery and engineering corps should be increased from eight months to twelve months. The King then gave an important speech, the main points of which are that Belgium must strengthen its national defense and become strong, so that neighboring countries will be deterred from invading Belgium or attacking third countries through this territory. Only then can Belgium engage in effective cooperation for peace in Western Europe and win the respect of peace-loving countries. Once something happens, various countries can also provide assistance to Belgium, especially since the obligations that Belgium bears in the international community should be limited to this, and it is unwilling to bear other obligations. The King then explained the reasons for Belgium's strengthening of national defense as follows: (1) Germany is reorganizing its military without sparing any effort. Italy and the Soviet Union have also been completely militarized. Even countries that love peace the most, such as Switzerland, have also begun to strengthen their national defense. Therefore, Belgium should take special measures to adapt to this situation. (2) Modern tactics are developing rapidly. This poses a greater threat to small countries like Belgium than to other countries. (3) After Germany re-established defenses along the Rhine River, the border line there has become the base for the country's future acts of aggression. (4) International treaties have been repeatedly violated in recent years, and even those freely signed by various countries have not been spared. As a result, the international security mechanism has been weakened. (5) Internal strife in a certain country has had repercussions internationally, and there is a risk of causing an unprecedented catastrophe. Based on the above reasons, Belgium has its own necessity to strengthen national defense. The purpose of the military policy adopted by Belgium is to prevent war, and not to conclude alliances with other countries in order to prepare for a victorious war. Since Germany abolished the Locarno Pact and re-established defenses along the Rhine River, Belgium's international position has almost returned to its original state before 1914. Now, to ensure Belgium's security, it is no longer possible to conclude alliances with other countries. Once Belgium is invaded, it must first resist alone, no matter what. The assistance measures stipulated in the alliance will only take effect after the act of aggression has occurred, which is too slow to be effective. Therefore, we must adopt a completely "Belgian" policy in the future, so that our country will not be dragged into the vortex due to disputes between neighboring countries, which is in line with the ideals of the Belgian nation. However, to implement this policy, we must make reasonable efforts in military and financial terms before it can be effective. The people of our country all have the desire to maintain peace and will definitely agree with this policy. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The French authorities believe that the King's speech has completely destroyed the entire post-war European system, and has broken all kinds of agreements signed by various countries in order to seek security.

<p>(Paris) The people of Paris were greatly shocked by the King's speech, because they had not heard of any preparatory discussions beforehand. Diplomatic circles, because the matter is of great importance, should be cautious in their statements, so they are now taking a silent attitude, but they believe that Belgium's return to complete neutrality will have a significant impact on the entire system of collective security. According to a dispatch from the Paris correspondent of Le Petit Parisien, Belgium's military plan stipulates the defense of various borders, including the Franco-Belgian border. The correspondent means that Belgium is probably afraid that when Russia and Germany start a conflict, France, if it invokes the Franco-Soviet Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, may take the route through Belgium to attack Germany.

<p>(Berlin) After the King of Belgium, Leopold III, delivered a speech yesterday, advocating for a diplomatic policy, the impression gained by political figures here was extremely good. It is believed that the more neutral countries there are, the fewer opportunities there will be for countries to stir up trouble. The King of Belgium's actions have made a significant contribution to world peace. As for the country's extension of the term of military service, it is sufficient to show that the country is unwilling to be drawn into the vortex of international disputes. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) After the King of Belgium, Leopold III, explained the policy of neutrality at the State Council of the country yesterday, officials here have not yet commented on it. Political figures stated that the future conference of the Locarno Five and the conclusion of the future pact on the banks of the Rhine River have thus occurred. Important new factors, Britain and France, should immediately conduct diplomatic talks and study them. British political figures also said that although Belgium was a permanently neutral country in 1914, it was still invaded by Germany. Looking at the past in light of the present, its geographical and military strategic position is the same. This situation cannot be controlled by the policies pursued by the government of the country. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the King of Belgium, Leopold III, delivered his speech yesterday, everyone here was shocked. People from the League of Nations believe that since the country has made a new stand on diplomacy, the negotiations between Western European countries on concluding regional pacts and implementing mutual assistance policies will not be able to continue, and the situation of the future Locarno Conference will also be completely changed. Also, the King of the country said that the guarantees on the international stage are no longer effective, and the implication is that he also opposes the strengthening of the effectiveness of the League of Nations. Political figures said that the purpose of Belgium's sudden change of policy is to prevent Bolshevism from spreading to Europe. The main motivation should be sought in the internal political situation. (15th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German government has today sent the British Foreign Office a reply to Britain's memorandum on the Locarno issue.

It is heard that although the reply leaves room for continued progress, it still opposes inviting Soviet Russia to participate in these negotiations. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the German chargé d'affaires in Britain, Bismarck, met with Foreign Office officials Westall this afternoon, and discussed the prospects of the Locarno Five Conference and the relations between Germany and France. It is heard that Bismarck mentioned the demonstrations held by the French Communist Party in the border areas of Alsace and Lorraine last Sunday, saying that Germany now has to take various preventive measures for the sake of preventing trouble before it happens, and that the construction of defensive works in the Rhine Province is also one of them. As for the Locarno Five Conference, Bismarck said that Germany is still prepared to conclude a new Locarno Pact, but stipulates that the scope of the pact should be strictly limited to Western Europe, and that Italy was only a guarantor country in the old Locarno Pact, not a protected country. In the future, the new Locarno Pact should also stipulate the security of Italy. Political figures now believe that Berlin's anti-Soviet Russian sentiment is still dominant, so it is feared that the hope of signing a new Locarno Pact will be difficult without a long delay.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is planning to establish a large-scale rice control organization in Tokyo to maintain supply and manage the market. It will handle the government's rice, stockpile grains, and manage other related matters. The Ministry also proposes to abolish the existing rice exchange offices operating in nineteen major cities in Japan, and compensate the 230 licensed rice merchants for their loss of income with government funds. It is reported that after the implementation of the above two measures, the current fluctuating rice prices will cease, and speculation in rice transactions will be eliminated. This is because the rice control organization will have the power to regulate rice prices. Its capital will be jointly raised by the government and the public. In effect, this organization will represent the government in regulating rice prices and controlling grain production throughout Japan. The total amount of private investment has not yet been determined, but the total capital will be approximately 40 million yen, and the government will guarantee an annual interest of 6% to the shareholders. Details of the above plan will be announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the near future. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Pittsburgh, USA Japanese Ambassador to the US, Saito, speaking to the crowd at the Carnegie Institute's anniversary today, said that war has not yet occurred in the Pacific region, and we firmly believe that this trend can be maintained. Saito recognized Japan's intention to invade China, saying that Japan only asks to cooperate with China to help China's rejuvenation. The assertion that Japan has made demands that undermine Chinese sovereignty is inaccurate. However, Saito tacitly admitted that the military occupation of land is reasonable, saying that the power between individuals always waxes and wanes. Once this waxing and waning is recognized by law, society will return to peace. However, from the perspective of national defense, this transfer of power has not yet been legalized and can only be achieved through war. Therefore, condemning war is tantamount to ignoring the waxing and waning of the power of various nations and obliterating the facts. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Chicago Lord Marley, Deputy Speaker of the British House of Lords, speaking at the Commercial Association here today, strongly urged Britain and the United States to deeply understand each other to prevent war in the Pacific. The Lord said that Japanese leaders aim to expand their power throughout the Pacific islands because the "enlightened" figures in the Japanese Navy and business leaders all want to realize the dream of expanding the Japanese Empire. Japan's recent abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty and the establishment of defenses on the mandated islands are all indications of increasing power in the Pacific. Moreover, Japan's activities in the Philippines have also increased, and it is expected that Australia and the Dutch East Indies will be affected. To prevent this, the only solution is a joint action by Britain, the United States, and Canada. If Japan cannot develop in the Pacific and does not attack Russia, it must limit its ambitions on the Asian continent. Japan's motives are contrary to democratic ideals. Its military and economic ideas hold that Japan can be self-sufficient, so the claim that its population can increase rapidly is a mistake. Japan is not a colonial country, and its real problem is how to obtain raw materials and how to sell its surplus production. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

This afternoon, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushanokoji, he will visit Foreign Minister Neurath and Hitler's confidant, the newly appointed Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, and other German dignitaries. He is scheduled to depart for Moscow on the 16th of this month, and on the 18th of this month, he will depart from Moscow and return to China via Siberia. Today, a Havas reporter interviewed Mr. Yoshizawa, who said, "Although the future of world politics is still bleak, I do not believe that there is a possibility of war between Germany and Russia, Germany and France, or Japan and Russia, or even between China and Japan. On the contrary, I firmly believe that the major European countries will be able to establish a broad economic agreement to ease the tense political situation. Therefore, it is necessary to reconvene the World Economic Conference. Although this conference is still a long way off, I believe there will be a day when it will be held." Yoshizawa continued, "I have been repeatedly asked by American friends in the United States whether there is a fact of an alliance between Japan and Germany. I have repeatedly stated that there is currently no alliance treaty between Japan and Germany, but it is difficult to predict in the future. As for the current negotiations between China and Japan, I earnestly hope that these negotiations will succeed. It is inevitable that China and Japan will reach an understanding, even if this understanding requires a long period of preparation, it will eventually be achieved." (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Situation in North China Turns Gloomy: Important Meeting of Japanese Army in Tianjin; Diplomatic Future Appears Pessimistic <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, the Chief of the Japanese Army's Special Service Agency in Shanghai, Kusonoki, arrived north on the 13th by China National Aviation Corporation plane to convey the opinions of the senior overseas leaders of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry on diplomacy toward China. At 3:00 pm that day, the Commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, Tashiro, specially convened all his staff for a meeting at his official residence on Miyajima Street. More than 20 people participated, including Chief of Staff Hashimoto and Senior Staff Officer Iida. Kusonoki reported on the meeting between Kawagoe and Chiang Kai-shek in Kyoto on the 9th of this month, as well as the recent diplomatic opinions decided by senior executives of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry agencies in Shanghai. After lengthy discussions, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm due to the complexity of the relationship and the multiple parties involved, making it difficult to make a decision quickly. Another meeting is scheduled for the 16th. At that time, the generals of the Japanese Kwantung Army will send staff officers Tanaka Kichiji, Ueda, and Itagaki. After the specific plan is decided at that time, Kusonoki will bring it back to Shanghai and convey it to Kawagoe to support the progress of diplomacy. Tashiro also ordered staff officer of the Command, Wachi Takaeji, to fly to Shanghai at 1:50 pm on the 13th to visit military attachés in Shanghai such as Kita, Sasaki, and Utsunomiya to explore their intentions. On the 15th, he went to Nanjing to visit Kawagoe to inquire about the diplomatic situation. On the 16th, he rushed back to attend the meeting convened by the Japanese Kwantung and North China command headquarters in Tianjin. It is reported that before the meeting was held, Kusonoki first visited Matsumuro and Kawabe in Peiping on the 14th to discuss the matter and planned to meet with Song. On the 15th or 16th morning, he flew to Suiyuan and Chahar to meet with the chiefs of the Japanese Kwantung and North China special service agencies, Kuwabara, Omoto, Hayama, and Yokoyama, to exchange intentions. On the same day, he returned to Tianjin to attend the military attaché meeting. It is heard that the result of Kawagoe's meeting with Chiang Kai-shek on October 9 was quite pessimistic in terms of diplomacy. Originally, the hopes held by the Japanese side were difficult to achieve. The two Japanese systems stationed in China, the Army and the Navy, almost wandered on the fork of peaceful concession and decisive war. Most of the Japanese residents in Peiping and Tianjin, in view of the failure of diplomacy, published papers in the newspapers expressing that the policies adopted by the overseas agencies of the Army and Navy provinces were digging their own graves and leading their national destiny into a tragic situation. Therefore, the Japanese Army Command in North China felt a great sense of responsibility and anxiety. The scope of the meeting at the Tomishima-cho official residence in Tianjin on the 13th generally determined that the four demands on China could not be withdrawn, but they would never insist on them. The first item, the construction of a buffer zone in the five provinces of North China, would be left to the leaders of the provinces themselves to decide. The second item, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, would be changed to start with North China first, or simply be called the economic development of North China. If there are equivalent alternative conditions for the third and fourth items, they can be withdrawn even if the quantity is lighter, so as to avoid a stalemate. It is also heard that the Japanese Kwantung and North China command headquarters are actually the basis for supporting Sino-Japanese diplomacy. At first, the two command headquarters observed the expansion of the four demands and the expansion of Japan's prestige, thinking that they could win without firing a shot. Now, they have not achieved their wishes, which is unexpected. It is still uncertain how to handle the so-called second step. At present, the talk of war seems to have passed. The collision between the two command headquarters is because the Russian side intentionally impedes the progress of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, and they have concerns. Those who initially advocated being tough to the end or advocating the use of force are now hesitant and worried about the diplomatic future.

<p>The following is the criminal judgment of the Jiangsu High Court regarding the case of Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng accused: Appellant Tan Zhuohong, male, 39 years old, resident of an apartment on Avenue Joffre, Shanghai, former judge of the Shanghai District Court, appointed defense lawyers Shan Yuhua and Yao Xiaoqiu; Appellant Yang Shaopeng, male, 48 years old, resident at No. 20, Lane 150, Baker Road, Shanghai, lawyer, appointed defense lawyers Lu Dingkui and Qian Jiazhen. The above-named appellants, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment of the Wu County District Court of the Republic of China on June 25, 1936, regarding their malfeasance case, filed an appeal. The court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>The original judgment is reversed. Tan Zhuohong, jointly guilty of requesting bribes for actions violating his duties, is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for four years; for abuse of authority in personally detaining someone, he is sentenced to one year of imprisonment; the sentences shall be served concurrently for a total of four years, with deprivation of civil rights for four years.</p>
<p>Yang Shaopeng, jointly guilty of requesting bribes for actions violating his duties, is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for four years.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>During Tan Zhuohong's tenure as a judge in the Shanghai District Court, he colluded with Yang Shaopeng, who was practicing law, to solicit bribes from litigants. In September 1935, Wu Peizhen filed a private prosecution with the Shanghai District Court against her husband, Li Keting, for the offense of interfering with marriage. Because Tan Zhuohong was handling the case, Tan Zhuohong abused his authority by detaining Li Keting. On the 9th of the same month, the court accepted Wang Bingnan and Lei Xianzhi (i.e., the law firm of Zhu Yisheng, the appointed agent for the civil lawsuit attached to the Wang Bingnan trademark counterfeiting case). Yang Shaopeng told Zhu Yisheng, "Judge Tan Zhuohong, who is handling the case, told me to tell you that if your client spends some money, the case can be handled to his satisfaction." Zhu Yisheng did not agree. Later, Zhu Yisheng relayed the incident of Yang Shaopeng soliciting a bribe to Zhao Deru, the business director of Lei Xianzhi's store. Zhao Deru also ignored it. Unexpectedly, Yang Shaopeng, still hoping there was a chance, repeatedly informed Zhu Yisheng by telephone, reducing the originally requested bribe of $2,000 to $400, and when he reduced it to $400 by phone, he stated that Tan would reopen the debate on Wang Bingnan's case, giving you one last chance," etc. Zhu Yisheng still refused. In October of the same year, Tan Zhuohong handled the private prosecution of Zhang Qidong and Yang Dingcheng against Song Dacheng for defamation. Again, using the same method, after the first trial, Yang Shaopeng, in collusion, went to Sun Zuji, the agent appointed by Zhang Qidong, et al., and stated that the evidence in the private prosecution case was weak, but if a considerable price was paid, the defendant could be severely punished. "Judge Tan sent me to contact you," and so on. Sun Zuji also did not agree. The private prosecutors Zhang Qidong, et al., having heard from Zhu Yisheng about Yang Shaopeng's solicitation of bribes, again believed it was right to refuse his request. Subsequently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, based on a confidential report, learned that Yang Shaopeng was soliciting bribes on behalf of Tan Zhuohong and ordered an investigation and reply. It also secretly ordered the chief prosecutor of this court to transfer Tan Zhuohong, et al., to another court for investigation. After receiving the order, the chief prosecutor of this court, along with the original files, ordered the prosecutor of the Wu County District Court to investigate. As a result, Tan Zhuohong, et al., were publicly prosecuted for dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The reasons for this case are discussed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the portion of Wu Peizhen's private prosecution against Li Keting, it is found that Wu Peizhen's private prosecution and the testimony provided during the first court hearing indicate that she and Li Keting have the status of a married couple. According to Article 319 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a private prosecution cannot be filed. After the appellant Tan Zhuohong took over the case, he should have directly ruled it inadmissible according to Article 326 of the same law, which would have been the proper course of action. However, he still scheduled hearings and, after questioning, ordered a security deposit of $1,000, and detained him without bail, which was not lawful. Moreover, upon investigation, Wu Peizhen's private prosecution cited Article 238 of the Criminal Law, the elements of which require a final judgment. Since the marriage between Wu Peizhen and Li Keting has not been definitively judged, it is clear that a crime has not been committed in substance. Therefore, there was no need for bail after questioning. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the appellant's order for bail was proper, and the subsequent detention was due to lack of bail, then once bail was provided according to the court's ruling, the reason for the detention disappeared, and there was no reason to continue the detention. However, when the appellant questioned the guarantor on the 15th, he demanded that the guarantor also be responsible for the attached civil lawsuit of $10,000, which can only be described as absurd. If we further assume that Wu Peizhen's attached civil lawsuit was filed after the court ordered bail, then the appellant's demand that the guarantor also guarantee the amount claimed in the attached civil lawsuit outside of the court's ruling could be justified. However, the investigation of the files reveals that Wu Peizhen's attached civil lawsuit of $10,000 was stated in the private prosecution document, and should have been examined by the appellant before the court ruling. Tan Zhuohong granted bail to Li Keting clearly because of the criminal matter, not for the attached civil lawsuit. Now, despite the guarantor's willingness to bear the $1,000 security deposit as per the court's ruling, he unreasonably demanded that the guarantor guarantee the amount claimed in the attached civil lawsuit. When the guarantor refused, he stated that he would allow the guarantor to consider and then question him again, thus continuing Li Keting's detention. His crime of abuse of power by detention is truly undeniable. In this regard, the appellant argued, "At that time, I only told the guarantor that there was an attached civil lawsuit of $10,000, but I did not want the guarantor to guarantee the attached civil lawsuit. The part about the guarantor guaranteeing it in the record is a mistake," etc. However, the record in question has been signed by the appellant, making it difficult to deny it as a record error. As evidenced by the fact that Li Keting's defense lawyer, Lu Jianai, appeared in court on the 17th of the same month, the appellant questioned him whether he was willing to guarantee the attached civil lawsuit of $10,000 in Wu Peizhen's lawsuit against Li Keting for marriage fraud, and only after he answered yes was Li Keting released. Therefore, there is no doubt that the words "the guarantor guarantees the attached civil lawsuit" in the record are not a mistake. Further investigation reveals that after Li Keting was detained, Yang Shaopeng went to Gao Junxiang's (i.e., Li Keting's defense lawyer) office. He described what Judge Tan asked you what your opinion of this case was, and Lu Jianai at the time described, I have an opinion, a spouse cannot privately prosecute, Judge Tan's illegal detention is wrong, please tell Judge Tan not to violate the law, etc., according to Gao Junxiang and Lu Jianai's consistent testimony. The appellant Yang Shaopeng not only clearly admitted at the time how Lu Jianai pointed out Tan Zhuohong's violation of the law, but also said, "I therefore called Tan Zhuohong, please refer to the law together, and handle it carefully." Tan Zhuohong also stated in the original trial, "I was harmed by your (referring to Yang Shaopeng) phone call," etc. It is the appellant Tan Zhuohong who first detained Li Keting abusively, intending to facilitate the solicitation of bribes, and then, when Lu Jianai pointed out his illegality, fearing disaster, voluntarily changed the original court ruling and did not allow him to provide bail, and directly handed Li Keting over to Lu Jianai, hoping to avoid responsibility. This is even more certain. The original trial was not improper in finding Tan Zhuohong guilty of abuse of power by detention in this part. The crime in Article 128 of the Criminal Law refers to the situation where a civil servant accepts a lawsuit that they have no right to accept. Wu Peizhen's private prosecution should be accepted by the court, but the application of the private prosecution procedure is inappropriate. The court should make a judgment of inadmissibility, which is different from the crime stipulated in the above-mentioned legal text. The original trial also found Tan Zhuohong guilty of this crime, but their opinion is not quite appropriate. Furthermore, the crime of soliciting bribes requires that the intention of soliciting has reached the other party or their appointed agent before it can be established. Otherwise, even if there is a soliciting act, it is still an attempt, and there is no explicit provision for punishment in the law. In this case, although the appellants colluded to solicit bribes, Yang Shaopeng only expressed the intention of soliciting bribes to Gao Junxiang, Li Keting's defense lawyer (according to Gao Junxiang, Yang Shaopeng asked what opinions he had, but he didn't explicitly mention money). This intention did not reach the detained Li Keting, so it is still an attempted solicitation. The original trial believed that the appellants were also guilty of soliciting bribes in this part, which is unfair and should be reversed and re-judged by this court.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Wang Bingnan counterfeiting trademark case and the Zhang Qidong et al. private prosecution of Song Dacheng for defamation cases, the investigation reveals that the appellant Tan Zhuohong handled the Wang Bingnan and Song Dacheng cases in October of last year. After the first hearing in each case, Yang Shaopeng went to Zhu Yisheng and Sun Zuji's law firms successively. He told Zhu Yisheng that Judge Tan told me to tell you to spend some money, and the case can be handled to his satisfaction. He continued to notify Zhu Yi by phone, instructing him to pay $2,000, and when Zhu Yi refused, he reduced it to $1,000, and finally to $400. He said when reducing to $400 that the case has been reopened for debate, and there is an undecided opportunity for you in court. He told Sun Zuji that the evidence in Zhang Qidong's private prosecution case was weak. Judge Tan told me to contact you. If a considerable price is paid, the defendant can be severely punished, etc. Zhu Yisheng and Sun Zuji pointed this out in detail as if they were describing a painting. Sun Zuji's statement that Yang Shaopeng said that the debate would be reopened is consistent with the record. That is, the appellant Yang Shaopeng did not deny that he went to Zhu Yisheng and Sun Zuji's law firms to discuss the cases. His defense was that he did not go to Zhu and Sun's firms on his own initiative, but that Zhu and Sun had called him by phone one after another, asking him to intercede with Judge Tan. Tan Zhuohong's main defense was that I did not know Yang Shaopeng, and Sun Zuji and Zhu Yisheng said that he would judge their cases and solicit bribes in my name. This is just Yang Shaopeng's behavior. How can it be considered my behavior? Not to mention that Yang Shaopeng does not admit this behavior, even if he did have this kind of behavior, it was just him using my name to swindle and deceive others, and it cannot be attributed to me, etc. However, Zhao Deru testified, "After this case was prosecuted, the criminal court held a hearing once. I went to Zhu Yisheng's place to inquire about the situation. Zhu Yisheng said that Yang Shaopeng came and told us to spend some money in court. We didn't pay attention because the evidence was solid." Zhang Qidong testified, "This case had a first hearing on October 14th last year. I went to Sun's law firm outside of the 10th and said, on the 16th of this month, lawyer Yang Shaopeng came to negotiate this case and said that he was Judge Tan who was handling the case in court, and asked him to say that our case's evidence was weak. If we want to convict the defendant, we must have a considerable price. At the time, I refused, etc. I said at the time that the refusal was correct." Yang Dingcheng's testimony was roughly the same. Furthermore, according to the testimony of Chen Fengming and Wang Jiacheng, after Yang Shaopeng met with Sun Zuji, Sun Zuji came back and said as a joke that to handle a small case, the judge in the court told him that my evidence was weak. To convict the defendant, I must pay a considerable price, etc., which is consistent with Zhu Yisheng and Sun Zuji's statements. This is sufficient proof that Zhu Yisheng and Sun Zuji's statements are credible. Therefore, the fact that the appellants solicited bribes can be confirmed. Moreover, the investigation reveals that Yang Shaopeng wrote to his wife, Chen Qinbao, from the detention center, stating, "I usually never received any money at home or on my person." "Thief Tan now wants to say some things that he shouldn't say, he wants to bite me and accuse me of fraud. My only evidence is the photo mentioned above. Sister Qingqin, be careful, be sure to hand the photo and the negative to Shen Xianniu for safekeeping. If Thief Tan harms me, I will use it as evidence, and Thief Tan will be in trouble. But don't show it now. Also, when the official asked for Mr. Chen Hanshi's address, I pretended to only know Shanjia Garden, and not the lane number. Now Chen has gone to Tianjin and Beiping. In case they find out Chen Hanshi's address and want to summon Mr. Chen, ask both teachers' wives to be sure to say that they don't know anything about men's affairs. Women don't know anything at all. (Omission) If Tan's family and lawyer Yang and I, as men, had any contact with Mr. Chen, force him to confess." "This letter must not be kept at home, nor should it be torn up. It can be given to Brother Shen to keep at his mansion." He also wrote to Zhang Shizhao, stating, "If I didn't uphold justice, he (referring to Tan Zhuohong) would really be in trouble. The reason for his usual behavior is hard to put into words," etc. Although the photo in question has not been seized, and Yang Shaopeng and his wife Chen Qinbao are unwilling to produce it, based on the above text, Yang Shaopeng's solicitation of bribes for Tan Zhuohong and the fact that his solicitation was not baseless, and that the fact of collusion to solicit bribes was known to Chen Hanshi's wife, et al., are ultimately obvious. Considering that Yang Shaopeng immediately notified Tan Zhuohong by phone after Lu Jia Ding pointed out Tan Zhuohong's illegal handling of the Li Keting case, asking him to refer to the law, and that Yang Shaopeng's home had Tan Zhuohong's business card, and Yang Shaopeng's letter mentioned that there was an invitation from Tan Zhuohong to a dinner at Da Jiali in his office drawer, the daily collusion between the appellants is even clearer. Tan Zhuohong's defense that he did not know Yang Shaopeng is an attempt to cover up the truth. The defense, etc., is all fabricated to avoid responsibility and cannot be believed. The original trial was not improper in finding that the appellants continuously solicited bribes in these parts. However, the crime of divulging secrets in Article 132 of the Criminal Law refers to the situation of divulging matters that should be kept secret. If a lawsuit is reopened for debate, it should be stated publicly that there is no so-called secret. When the appellant was soliciting a bribe in the Wang Bingnan case at the end, he claimed that the debate was reopened, giving you an undecided opportunity, just delaying the time to achieve the purpose of soliciting bribes. It is difficult to recognize that he also committed the crime of divulging secrets. Although the original trial found that the rules applied by the appellant in the Wang Bingnan case were not inappropriate, the original judgment sentenced the appellant for continuous offenses. Since other parts of the appellant have reasons for reversal, this part is ultimately unsustainable. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Scheduled Widening of Changqiao Street</p>
<p>Since the opening of the motor road in this city, the Changqiao Street outside the west gate has been the most convenient for connecting to the motor road and is located in the center of the West Gate Main Street. Therefore, entertainment businesses such as theaters are located here. The market on Changqiao Street has been growing year by year. However, the street is extremely narrow, and there is a risk of danger when two vehicles meet. The county government's 52nd meeting decided to widen the street, stipulating a width of 12 meters, with sidewalks of 1 meter on each side. The buildings on both sides should be taken into account. The existing road surface should be measured and a plan drawn up, which should be submitted to the finance and construction departments for instructions. It is now scheduled to start construction on February 15. The buildings on both sides of the street must be demolished and taken in accordance with the plan before December 5.</p>

<p>Theatrical Bandits Kill and Rob</p>
<p>About two miles outside the west gate of this county, in Baojia Township, District 1, farmer Yin Xingeng, who started by carrying water, built nine tile-roofed houses, which were coveted by bandits. At about 11 o'clock the night before, about 20 bandits broke into the side door. His son, Xilou, immediately went up to the roof and blew a whistle, which caused the bandits to fire at the roof, hitting his left leg and abdomen with six or seven shots. His son, Juezi, who was hanging upstairs, was also hit by stray bullets, injuring his forehead and hand. At this time, the neighbors were awakened and the sound of people was loud, and the bandits did not dare to rob and fled north after sounding their whistles. Xilou died of serious injuries. According to Yin Xingeng's family, six or seven of the bandits were wearing uniforms, leggings, and holding five or six long and short guns. Yesterday, the county Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate and reported it to the county government, which ordered the arrest. In addition, the home of Cao Chuanlin, a farmer in Zao Hong, District 1, was also robbed of more than 20 packages of cotton and more than 10 pieces of homespun cloth by more than a dozen bandits a few days ago. The servant Ni Xue was tied up with ropes and beaten, causing serious injuries. Yesterday, he was also carried to the county to have his injuries examined and request an investigation.</p>

<p>Promotion of Mechanical Silk Filatures</p>
<p>Since the Construction Department implemented the sericulture control, everything has gradually gotten on track. The price of silkworm eggs, the guidance of sericulture technology, and the cultivation of mulberry seedlings have all made considerable progress in recent years. However, the silk filatures have not been improved and are still old-fashioned silk kilns. They must be roasted by manpower, which increases costs and makes the quality of the goods uneven, which greatly affects the length of the silk. Currently, the cost of drying silkworm cocoons is about one yuan, which is unfavorable to farmers and silk merchants. If mechanical kilns are used, the cost of drying will be reduced, and each load will only cost about six or seven yuan. Currently, only Jintan County in Jiangsu Province uses mechanical kilns. In this county, Sitou Gongtailong silk filature also has a facility. However, the equipment cost is quite large, and official-merchant cooperation is required for investment and transformation. The Jiangsu Construction Department plans to gradually promote it starting in the spring of next year and must complete it within three years.</p>

<p>Rural Teachers Transformed into Agricultural Professionals</p>
<p>The rural normal school in Xitangqiao had all of its students graduate this summer, and the department ordered the school to be closed. It has repeatedly requested to continue, but has not been approved. This school was founded in 1932 and has already reached a certain scale, so it is a pity to close it suddenly. Currently, people in the education field, because schools are developed in the territory, but senior high schools are still lacking, have jointly petitioned to run an agricultural vocational high school so that ordinary children can have the opportunity to continue their education. The Department of Education believes that an agricultural vocational high school can indeed remedy the education in Changshu, and has approved it and instructed the Education Bureau to start preparing, and it is expected to be realized in the next semester.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Banknotes Consumed in Flames</p>
<p>Shen Fugeng, a farmer from Sanliqiao, Nantang outside the east gate, came to the city yesterday with his son in a boat to sell rice, totaling 18 shi of white rice, which was sold for 144 yuan in legal tender. After receiving the money, he planned to return home, but feeling hungry, Shen went ashore to have some noodles cooked. Fearing loss, he handed the money over to his son, strictly ordering him not to go ashore to prevent pickpocketing. Unexpectedly, his son saw that his father had been waiting for a long time and was not coming back, so he secretly hid the banknotes in the stove to prevent any problems. He then went ashore to find his father, but did not meet him. Unexpectedly, when he returned to the boat, he saw that his father had already returned and was lighting a fire to cook noodles. His son was shocked and called out, telling him that there were banknotes hidden in the stove. They quickly put out the fire and searched, but the 144 yuan in banknotes had been reduced to ashes. At that time, Shen's nerves went haywire, and all who saw it were greatly grieved.</p>

<p>In summary, the key lies first in:</p>
<p>Sound Economic Institutions</p>
<p>The Italian nation, through government-appointed personnel, has organized twenty-two industrial cooperation bureaus, bringing together consumers, sellers, and producers to work together to achieve balanced industrial and economic development. In addition, there are nine major trade associations for agriculture, industry, commerce, banking, insurance, and the free professions. Labor and management are organized separately to adjust their respective interests, striving for the overall improvement of the national economy. Because of this strict organization and these institutions, the government commands the whole nation as if it were a single person, directing it as easily as moving an arm. Its youth training is grounded in reality and pragmatism, offering much that is worthy of emulation. When the Italo-Ethiopian War was launched, the world assumed that the climate in East Africa was too hot and that marching there would be difficult. Little did they know that Mussolini had been training young people for fourteen years, having them train shirtless in the scorching sun at noon every day without interruption. Thus, they had become a formidable army capable of withstanding heat. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, although the army was far from home and faced economic hardship, it remained unwavering and ultimately achieved the final result. Although its aggressive militarism is difficult to sympathize with, the principles of national revival and construction are universally applicable throughout history. Today, China has suffered to the extreme, surviving nine deaths to reach one life. Success depends on self-reliance. The path to self-reliance begins with cultivating two types of strength:</p>
<p>Spiritual and Material</p>
<p>Modern warfare is not just a war of military force, but also a war of manpower, financial resources, material resources, and time. Therefore, how to tighten belts and save on food and clothing to cultivate more material strength for the country is the responsibility of every individual today. Given China's current poverty and the urgency of critical construction, everyone must not only be honest and serve the public, but must also take a step further by being economical and making one dollar do the work of two, and one minute do the work of two. Only then can we turn around the nation's destiny and have hope for the future. In terms of spiritual strength, we must cultivate a force that supports the leader until death, so that all national talent and wisdom can be concentrated under a single leader, sharing a common goal, taking the same steps, and uniting sincerely to fight together. We must recognize that Italy's ability to stand tall and dominate today is due to the success of Mussolini's iron-fisted politics. But Mussolini's ability to act decisively and do as he pleased was due to the countless "Mussolinis" throughout the country who supported him and sincerely defended him, enabling him to hold the reins and use them freely. We must realize that the vastness of our country's territory is like the whole of Europe. In the past, Napoleon, despite his great talent, failed to unify the European continent despite several expeditions. Our unified country is not comparable to the fragmented countries of Europe. However, given the low level of national education, the underdeveloped transportation, and the different lifestyles between the north and south, achieving unity is not easy. Today, with the pacification of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the unity of the whole country, it can be inferred that Generalissimo Chiang's talent surpasses even Napoleon's. Therefore, today, we should believe in doctrines and support the leader in spirit, and tighten belts and be economical in material terms. This is the only way to save ourselves from danger and achieve self-reliance in the future. Belief in doctrines and support for the leader should not be empty talk, but should start with oneself, set an example, and extend it to others. Tightening belts and being economical should not focus on theory, but should start immediately, put into practice, and be implemented earnestly. If everyone can be genuine and not pretentious, tell the truth, do real things, and match words with deeds, then the revival of China may be within reach. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Yarn and Cotton Prices Reach New Heights; Cotton Yarn Reaches 218 Yuan This Month; Short Covering Becomes More Urgent and Market Prices Soar <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning but rose sharply in the afternoon, and the trend remains tense. The shortage of yarn and the nervousness of short sellers caused buyers to swarm in as soon as the market tightened. The market price quickly jumped. It was reported in the afternoon that there were over 2,700 bales of 20-count Samsung yarn in the warehouse. This cotton yarn was said to be unwanted, but because the current stock has been exhausted, the Tianjin gang came to search for it and bought 500 bales, causing the selling price to rise by two yuan. As a result, the market was shaken and prices soared. The October price has reached a high of 218 yuan.</p>
<p>Prices Rise Two to Three Yuan Each Month</p>
<p>In the morning, the spot yarn market opened with long positions showing strong interest in near-term contracts, rising by four to seven jiao. Far-term contracts showed mixed gains and losses, fluctuating up and down by two to three jiao. After the second session, it was reported that yarn sales had decreased, and customer activity was lighter, causing market sentiment to weaken. However, due to the lack of spot yarn, long positions showed good interest. Some said that Japanese yarn could yield a profit of about twenty-five yuan per piece based on the cost of raw cotton and were very willing to open positions on far-term contracts, but yarn merchants were temporarily hesitant to accept them. Changyu, Wang Taixing, Gengfeng, Yongchang, and others sold off, while Taichang, Shenji, Yichang, Fukang, and others bought in. Volume was not strong. As a result, spot yarn prices for each month fell by two to six jiao compared to the previous day's close. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment was calm. There was no major trading in the second session. Unexpectedly, a surge in prices suddenly occurred in the third session, causing an urgent situation. It was said that there were about 3,000 bales of 20-count Samsung yarn available this month. The Tianjin gang bought 500 bales of this bargaining chip, and negotiations were underway for the rest. Also, the selling price was very high, so short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing prices to jump. In short, the spot goods are too scarce, so the price is likely to rise easily but not fall. The close for October was 218 yuan. As a result, each month's price rose by two yuan six jiao to three yuan three jiao compared to the morning close. Deda sold 1,750 bales, Changyu 3,400 bales, Wang Taixing 1,300 bales, Dachangcheng 1,900 bales, Shenji 2,850 bales, Taichang 1,100 bales, Changfeng 3,750 bales, Minghua 1,000 bales, Zhenda 1,200 bales, and Xingchang 700 bales. Mingde bought 2,250 bales, Hengyi 1,700 bales, Yuda 3,500 bales, Hexing 2,750 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Renfeng 1,200 bales, Runkang 1,600 bales, Yiji 800 bales, Tonghe 800 bales, and Ruida 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Reach 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still considerable. The statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 1,920 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by two yuan. The purchase volume of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Trade 30, Tianjin 700, Jiangxi 50, Nanjing 10</p>
<p>Hankou 400, Inland 360, Guangdong 105, Xuzhou 5</p>
<p>Shantou 10, Luzhou 60, Changsha 10</p>
<h3 id="e105">Cotton Also Pushes Towards New Heights; However, Due to Large-Scale Selling by Major Players, the Rise is Not as Strong as in the Yarn Market <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning but rose sharply in the afternoon, and the momentum is also pushing towards new heights. However, the major players are currently selling in bulk. A certain cotton company is selling a large amount, taking advantage of the availability of coarse cotton for delivery, so the cotton market is not as strong as the yarn market. However, the selling prices in various regions are difficult to loosen, and the price difference between yarn and cotton is too large given that yarn prices are constantly hitting new highs, so a reaction will be inevitable later on.</p>
<p>Far-Term Cotton Reaches 41.9 Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning, the spot cotton market opened with weak sentiment for the current month, while far-term months rose by five fen. Trading in the market was light. After the second session, due to the weakening of the yarn market, a slight decline began. The trend of American cotton was initially rising, and then it fell back. Market sentiment was mediocre. And with the surge of arrivals from all regions, the morale weakened and slumped. Hexing, Dafeng, Tongji, Shenchang, Changyu, Runkang, Yuanxingchang, Yichang, and others sold off, while Changfeng, Dafu, Mingde, Renfeng, Yuanda, Jue Tai bought in. The amounts were not large. As a result, spot cotton prices for each month fell by five fen to two jiao three fen compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon, the market was flat. Far-term months turned upwards. In the second session, there was a significant upward trend because Hexing, Gengfeng, and Runkang came to drag in large amounts. By the third session, as the yarn market jumped, cotton prices followed suit. Closing prices rose again, with far-term months closing at 41 yuan and nine jiao. As a result, each month's price rose by four jiao to five jiao six jiao compared to the morning close. Dafu sold 3,000 dan, Yujiu 3,500 dan, Dafeng 3,800 dan, Changyu 3,600 dan, Shenji 4,100 dan, Dachangcheng 3,400 dan, Yichang 7,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,000 dan, Changji 4,400 dan, Yuanyi 1,600 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Dachang 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 3,600 dan, and Xincheng 2,400 dan.

<p>Daily Factory Purchases of Spot Cotton Are Strong</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is still good, and Japanese factories are showing strong interest. The source is 2,640 bales of Yao cotton and 1,904 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool and Egypt, with increasing consumption. The trilateral economic agreement, benefitting the cotton industry, caused foreign firms and Wall Street to buy in, with each month rising one to eleven pounds. As short covering increased, there was a slight pullback. Spot cotton was firm and high, and the cloth market was firm and lively. Today's weather forecast predicts clouds or light rain in the east, and slight clouds in the central and western regions.

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: In the morning, cloth prices did not change much due to the slight fluctuation of spot yarn and cotton prices. In the afternoon, the rising trend of spot yarn and cotton prices reignited, and the cloth industry's morale became even higher. Japanese firms and foreign firms opened more than 500 bales of next month's fine cloth and fine twill futures, and the increase was (per piece) one jiao or more. The release of spot goods was not strong, but spot sales in various regions were very strong. Demand from Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Shantou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and inland areas increased, so the market continued to rise. The supply of unbleached cotton cloth was greatly lacking. Due to the current situation, inland gangs and local merchants have shrunk back from pledging warehouse receipts for Donghuo fine cloth and fine twill Shang Chu, but dyeing factories have been absorbing them incessantly. Spot goods in the market are scarce, and demand is intensifying. Yesterday, warehouse receipts for fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and other goods, were searched for and acquired at five hundred several dozen pieces. The coarse cloth from Yihua Factory also acquired one hundred over several dozen pieces, and the prices also rose again (per piece) by five fen to one jiao. Bleached cloth and blue cloth also rose. The various types of bleached cloth under the brands of Lun Chang, Qian Kun Yin, Yihua, Jin San Ta and other famous brands were all sold out. The prices of spot goods increased by three to four jiao. Blue cloth yuan twill also rose in price, but not as quickly as unbleached piece goods. Due to the lack of gray fabric, the output of printed goods and finished fabrics has been reduced, and the daily sales are extremely good.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Spot Piece Goods Also Rise Rapidly; Some Rise by One Jiao and a Half Per Yard; Some Rise by Three Yuan and One Jiao Per Piece <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday's flour market: In the morning opening, all months showed the same rising trend. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rebounded by three or four jiao, and Canada rose by five, six, and seven jiao or more, causing the internal and external markets to become active again.

Two, it felt as getting cold and cold. Besides, the wheat price in other countries are difficult to match, self-supporting feeling, which felt more powerful. Each month's range, near good is two fen and zero, far good is three to four fen. Opening in the afternoon, near term is flat, far-term is rare in leaving, very popular in going in. Because the price of foreign wheat is cheaper. Later, unless there are written laws to prohibit, the market fear prices will rise but fall.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, the opening this morning, the price of each month saw another high, because foreign wheat quotations, and returned to rise from three jiao and four jiao to five jiao six jiao seven jiao and so on. It's said to be difficult to settle down, because the rainfall is still felt insufficient, and annual earnings is not abundant. As a result, the market sentiment still gradually going up, and half of the domestic market is because the national wheat stock is insufficient to apply, half is because foreign countries are the background, resulting market sentiment, once you see foreign wheat price is high, calling the price is to vibrate. Each month immediately raised three or six or seven points in the morning. Until opening in the afternoon, the transactions are more Qing, the market tends to be flat, because the market rumors, China-Japan issues, will have good prospects.

<p>Northeast soybeans, this year's harvest is said to be only about 70%, causing costs to increase. Trading for profit is not easy. As a result, the city saw 4,200 packages of Niuzhuang Baimu soybeans for the first time yesterday (including a few hundred packages of green beans). The quality of this year's products is good, but the seeds are slightly smaller. Currently, oil pressing plants are still taking a wait-and-see approach, and exports are also restricted. Only the local market inquired about 507 packages, with prices of 6.45 yuan and 4.2 jiao. Additionally, 43 packages of green beans were traded at a price of 6.4 yuan. Given the current sluggish sales market and lack of trading profit, it will be difficult to receive subsequent batches. The market for other beans was also mediocre.

<h3 id="e116">Finance: Gold Standard Forward Fluctuations, Large Players' Selling Intentions Remain Strong, Resulting in a Further Drop of 70 Cents <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Although spot gold prices rose yesterday, stability was only slightly evident off-exchange. Large players increased their short positions and closed out long positions, leading to a downstream trend. The future market's fluctuations depended on forward premiums. Initial morning reports indicated stable or slightly higher forward silver prices in overseas silver markets, including London, New York, and Montreal, with exchange rates decreasing. London spot gold rose by one penny. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change for both London and New York, while customs gold units increased by two percent. The standard gold price was quoted at 1,154.70 yuan, with pre-market trading opening at 1,152.50 yuan or higher. Ding Kang Heng Yu sold off, falling back within two yuan. The morning opened lower. Although there was a brief rally after the opening, large players increased their short positions, and some long players also entered late. Buyers were hesitant. The HSBC exchange rate announcement showed no change for both London and New York, and the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. With a lack of changes mid-day, the trend weakened. Large players bought in at the lows, providing some support, and the market gradually stabilized by noon. Later, the market slightly weakened, but recovered as forward premiums fell, boosting confidence. However, the gains were limited as large players took profits, and the rising forward premiums pushed the market downstream again. In the end, the situation was uncertain. Yesterday, forwards were quoted at a premium of around 2.50 yuan by long players. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1,151.70 yuan, a drop of ten cents from the previous close. Hong Chang Yong bought a large position, pushing the price up to 1,152.10 yuan. Da De Cheng Yuan Mao Yong sold off, falling back to 1,151.60 yuan. Cheng Da Shang bought. HSBC's official exchange rate announcement showed no change for both London and New York, and the price rose to 1,151.80 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong and Da De Cheng continued to sell, and the silver equalization tax announcement showed no change, falling back to 1,150.60 yuan. Cheng Da, Da Chang Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Qia Feng Yong, and other firms maintained their positions by buying on the dips. The noon close was at 1,151.40 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was at 1,151.30 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, and Cheng Da sold, bringing the price down to 1,151.10 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Qia Feng Yong, and Cheng Da bought back, and forward premiums fell from 2.50 yuan to 2.00 yuan, then rose to 2.30 yuan. Qia Feng Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Sheng Yuan Yong, and other firms sold off, and forward premiums rose again to 2.50-2.60 yuan, then gradually fell to 1.00 yuan. Da De Cheng Lai Jin briefly rose to 1.80 yuan, while Heng Chang Yong sold off, pushing the price back down to 1.00 yuan. After fluctuating, the closing price was 1,151.10 yuan. After the close, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, and Yu Gou bought, providing more stability.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, rose to 1,154.70 yuan. According to the spot market price, the spot price was over one yuan higher. The registration price for this month was 1,146 yuan, and for November it was 1,151 yuan. The morning water price was 1,146 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were quoted at a premium of 3.75 yuan, and Hechi goods at a premium of 11.50 yuan, but there were no transactions. The selling price was quoted at a premium of 16.50 yuan, and Sheng Yuan Yong sold 140 taels to the Hankou guild and 70 taels to silver shops.</p>
<p>Trading was normal in the exchange. In total, Qia Feng Yong, Cheng Da, Chun Yuan Yong, Da Chang Xiang, Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, Yi Da, Fu Yu, and Tong Fu were among the buyers. Da De Cheng, Tong Feng, Heng Jing, Fu Shen, Da Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Zheng Chang, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, Ding Kang, Heng Chang Yong, and others were among the sellers. Da De Cheng bought after selling. Cheng Da, Chun Yuan Yong, Qia Feng Yong, and Sheng Yuan Yong bought first and then sold.</p>
<p>The day's market still saw mixed activity. The morning opening was at 1,151.70 yuan, and the closing was at 1,151.10 yuan. The high was 1,152.30 yuan, and the low was 1,150.60 yuan, a fluctuation of 1.70 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 70 cents from the previous close.</p>
<p>Forwards (November against October): The initial off-exchange quote was a premium of 2.20-2.30 yuan from long players. Although Ding Kang and Da De Cheng bought, Fu Yu, Da Chang Xiang, Qing Fa Yong, Wu Chang Xiang, Jiu Da, and Heng Chang Yong sold, pushing the price up to 2.50 yuan. Da De Cheng, Jing Fu, Tong Feng Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Cheng Da, and Yu Xin Xiang bought, falling back to 2.00 yuan. The official opening at 2:30 PM was a premium of 2.10 yuan from sellers.

Da De Cheng, Tong Feng Heng, and Cheng Da bought, falling to 2.30-2.40 yuan. Fu Xing Yuan Mao Yong sold, and the closing price rose again to 2.50 yuan. After the close, although Qing Fa Yong and Cheng Da bought, Da Chang Xiang sold and remained stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, short players issued 62 public orders from Fa Yong, 42 from Yong Feng, 35 from Qian Chang Xiang, 28 from Yuan Mao Yong, and 7 from Sheng Yuan Yong. Long players should receive 49 orders from Da Chang Xiang, 35 from Qia Feng Yong, 28 each from Da De Cheng and Fu Tai Heng, 21 from Ding, and 7 each from Da Heng and Wan Xing, for a total of 175 orders. The closing price was 1,146 yuan. Excluding the public orders for this month, there is a net surplus of 280 orders, with seven long players and one short player.</p>
<p>For November contracts that have not yet been swapped, long players have 1,800 from Qia Feng Yong, over 600 from Da Chang Xiang, over 400 from Fu Da, over 300 from Yuan Mao Yong, and over 100 each from Shen Kang, Yi Da, and Ding Kang. Short players have over 700 from Sheng Yuan Yong, over 600 from Da Heng, over 400 each from Qian Chang Xiang and Cheng Da, over 200 from Fu Tai Heng, and over 100 each from Run Chang Yu, Da Feng Heng, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, and Shun Mao.

<h3 id="e117">Exchange Rate Decline: Foreign Exchange Only Slightly Looser for Shillings - Bank of China Supports Sterling, Sells USD <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The exchange market saw declining exchange rates yesterday, with sterling loosening and the US dollar tightening, resulting in a relatively flat outcome. Initial morning reports from overseas telegrams indicated flat London large bills and short-term rates, stable New York silver market, and Montreal forward silver prices stable or up by as much as 4%. London spot gold rose by one penny. Sterling against the US dollar weakened by 0.08125, sterling against the French franc rose by 3 pounds, the US dollar against sterling weakened by 0.05625, and the US dollar against the French franc weakened by 0.06875. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change for both London and New York, while customs gold units increased by two percent. The morning opening exchange rate for forward sales was 1 shilling 2.4375 pence for sterling and 29.4375 yuan for the US dollar, indicating a stable sterling and a tighter US dollar by 0.0625. This was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, Chinese banks aggressively sold spot US dollars, so although foreign banks bought, the HSBC exchange rate announcement showed no change for both London and New York. The situation was not encouraging. Foreign banks sold shillings, and the Bank of China supported them. The silver equalization tax announcement showed no change. After this, the overall trend fluctuated, but the near-term US dollar tended to harden. Later, Chinese merchants continued to supply US dollars, and banks bought on the cheap, while also doing sterling and forward transactions, resulting in a flat outcome. By the close, near-term selling rates were 1 shilling 2.4375 and 2.46875 pence, and 29.5 yuan for the US dollar, indicating a slightly looser sterling and a stable US dollar compared to the previous close. The forward rates were similar. Chinese merchants slightly reduced US dollars, and the Bank of China bought spot shillings and sold US dollars. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price for near-term sterling was 1 shilling 2.4375 pence. China Xing sold spot to McGreggor at 2.4687. McGreggor bought December at 2.375. Citibank Mitsui sold spot to the Bank of China at 2.46875, and Citibank bought December at 2.375. Later in the market, HSBC sold January to Citibank McGreggor at 2.375, and Citibank sold October to Yuli at 2.46875. The closing selling rates were 1 shilling 2.4375 and 2.46875 pence, with October at a premium of 2.40625, November at 2.375 and 2.40625, December at 2.357 and January at a premium of 2.3125. The buying price was slightly higher.</p>
<p>The morning opening price for the near-term US dollar was 29.4375 yuan. The Bank of China sold spot at 0.5 yuan to Citibank McGreggor Hua Bi. McGreggor Citibank bought October at 0.5 yuan, and Shanghai bought December at 2.3125. The noon closing price for the near-term was 29.4375 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Later in the market, Mitsui Zhejiang bought November at 2.4375. Mitsui McGreggor bought December at 2.375. Mitsui sold October to Citibank at 0.5 yuan, and Continental sold October to Citibank at 2.4375. Citibank sold December to Continental at 2.3125. The closing selling price was 29.5 yuan, with October at 2.4375, November at 2.4375, December at 2.3125, and January at 2.25. The buying price was 0.0625 higher.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Securities: Bond Market Is Brewing, Retail Investors Absorbing Slightly, Prices Seem to Rise Slightly, C, D, and E All Break the 60 Yuan Mark <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw market conditions still fluctuating, with a brewing sense of change. The dull situation failed to break through. With the Sino-Japanese issue not yet clear, the bond market was not easily affected, so trading also decreased. Large players were mostly watching from the sidelines, with only some forward transactions on the trading floor. Retail investors absorbed slightly, and prices seemed to rise slightly. However, there were still many hidden reefs, and the future was still not optimistic. Yesterday, at the opening, No. 16 E-type bonds were lifted, and No. 5 and No. 35 were also bought. Market prices rose slightly by 0.05-0.30 yuan. At the settlement, No. 34 and No. 53 were bought slightly, and retail investors continued to absorb, rising another 0.11 yuan. At the afternoon opening, No. 6, No. 14, No. 33, and No. 35 were sold, falling back slightly by 0.05-0.15 yuan. Trading was light at the close. E-type bonds were slightly weaker, and the rest turned slightly stronger. The trend did not break free from fluctuation, and there were many changes ahead. As a result, market prices rose slightly by 0.05-0.30 yuan. C, D, and E types all broke the 60 yuan mark. The total transaction volume was 4,826,000 yuan. The resulting price changes are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e119">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Reports Rise, White Filature Yarn Trading Suddenly Booms <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets continued to be firm. Sales of white filature B grade were quite active. New York and Shanghai silk 7-8 denier saw a rise of 1 cent, and Leizhan Shanghai silk B grade rose 1 franc. Other silk products saw no major changes. The New York Stock Exchange raw silk near-term sales were up 1-1.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices also rose in tandem. The market was robust and not weak. Shanghai's American and French traders therefore became more active, and confidence became stronger. The silk market, which had been depressed for a long time, saw a busy day of business yesterday. If the Yokohama silk market can be more stable in the future, then Shanghai's silk market will be even more prosperous. On the domestic sales side, as the situation gradually returned to stability and foreign silk traders completed deliveries, there was also a strong buying intention, and trading could gradually become more prosperous. Yesterday, the entire city traded 400 bales, with foreign traders accounting for more than three-quarters.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Sugar Market: Five Fortune White Ice Arrived, Shortage of Both Existed, Mian Chi Production Price Increased By 20 Cents <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was stable yesterday. The guild's price for two-four coarse sand white, four-eight-nine East White, and local mian bai remained unchanged. There was some sporadic selling of domestic Qing, but not much. According to Shantou telegraphs, mian chi had only a few thousand bags in inventory, and prices rose by 10 cents due to frequent activity. There were approximately ten thousand bags of Chaoqing in total, which cannot be considered a large amount, and the trend was also tightening. Yesterday, Miscellaneous Road Qing saw the Jian Gang open 200 bags, priced at 13.10 yuan. Five Fortune Folded Ice became firmer due to the gradual shortage of arrivals and inventory, and future arrivals may need to rise slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e121">On Reading, to My Nephew <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Si</p>
<p>Xi Cong:</p>
<p>I received your letter and learned that you passed your transfer exam. I was very happy to hear that. You said, "From now on, I can walk less each day and save the time I spend walking to read more books." These two sentences are correct, but reading is not a casual matter. It's not just about burying yourself in books all the time. Your grandfather's letter says that you only like to read novels. As long as you have a novel in hand, you lie on the rattan chair all day and even forget to eat. Although I don't object to young people reading novels, I don't think this method is right. Reading is like eating. After you eat something, you need your stomach to be able to digest it and digest it cleanly. "Indigestion" and "gluttony" will ruin your stomach, that's one point; secondly, if you don't pick and choose what you eat, you'll also ruin your stomach. The ancients said, "Sickness enters through the mouth," which is because you don't pick and choose what you eat. Reading is the same. Burying yourself in books all day will cause your brain to become congested, and soon your brain will become dizzy. This is very dangerous for your body. And with your reading method, you definitely can't fully understand the meaning of the book - at most you only understand the story recorded in the book, which is also wrong. When young people read, on the one hand, they should understand the content of the book, but the most important thing is to understand and analyze the methods used by others to write articles. Because when we read, on the one hand, we are seeking knowledge, and on the other hand, we are gaining methods for writing articles by others as a reference for when we write our own articles. If you don't add criticism or taste the method when reading, you will never be able to write your own articles, and you will never be able to use pen and ink to convey your thoughts to the world. What's the point of reading like that? Reading like that, even if you read for a lifetime, even if you finish reading all the books in front of you, even if you remember them all, aren't you just like a bookshelf? As a joke, a bookshelf can still be burned as firewood, but a bookworm who has read books and can't express them is useless except for eating.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is so-called "food poisoning," and there is also poison in the books you read. If you don't choose carefully, there is also a risk of brain poisoning. I hope you will ask your teacher more about this. If your teacher has already given you a list of books you should read, that's great. If not, you can either ask your teacher to make a list, or you can first ask your teacher to review the books you want to read. If the teacher says it's okay, then read it carefully. That way, you may be able to avoid the danger of brain poisoning!</p>
<p>Writing this, I want to talk to you about my bad experiences reading in the past. I started school later than you. At your age, I was still in elementary school, but my physical and mental development was similar to yours. What I liked at that time was also novels. At that time, the school teacher prohibited students from reading novels, but the stories in novels were more interesting than the things in textbooks, and besides the Chinese, arithmetic, English, history, geography, and science classes that needed to be reviewed a little, there was a lot of free time every day. I didn't like to exercise - and the school didn't force us to exercise either, so several of us classmates adopted the method of secretly reading novels to pass our extra time. I was living at the school at that time, and I didn't want to go home even on holidays, because I could hide in the dormitory and read novels all day long. On weekdays, I put the novel by the bedside. As soon as the sky was a little bit white, I would take the small lamp from the bedside and read greedily. When I was in self-study class, I would also put the novel under the textbook. As soon as the teacher's footsteps left, my hand would close the textbook, and my eyes would simultaneously focus on the oily paper and small print below. Even the ten or twenty minutes before going to bed and turning off the vegetable oil lamp were not spared. I would rather fumble in the dark to take off my clothes after turning off the light.</p>
<p>What did the three years I spent in late elementary school - what was then called higher elementary school - give to my body and mind?</p>
<p>First, it made my eyes nearsighted: because those novels were all lithographic prints as large as the current font size 5, plus the reflection of the oily paper. The light of the vegetable oil lamp at night and the fish-white light of the morning were both utilized through the coarse yellow calico curtain, and I had to press the book against my nose. At first, I felt my eyeballs swell, and later I had to sit in the first or second row to see the words on the blackboard. When I entered middle school, I finally couldn't do without wearing glasses.</p>
<p>Second, it cultivated my neurasthenia and insomnia: the dormitory didn't have self-study room equipment, and I mostly read novels lying in bed, so the blood gathered smoothly in my head. At first I felt my face was hot, then I felt my brain was swelling. Although my brain was extremely tired, I couldn't help but think, "I don't know how it will turn out, let's listen to the next chapter." With one stroke, oh, did he die in the end? So I couldn't care about whether my brain was tired or not. And even if I had to put it down, the stories in the novel, even though they didn't concern me, I couldn't help but think about them one by one. Not only did I think with my eyes open, but I couldn't help but have many nightmares or erotic dreams with my eyes closed. In this way, at first I didn't want to sleep, and later I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to. Later I realized that this was "insomnia," this was so-called neurasthenia!</p>
<p>Third, it made me develop the bad habit of "swallowing dates whole" when reading: reading novels only pays attention to the story, and that's how most young people are, right? And what I read at that time were all chaptered novels, such as Tang Chuan, Zheng Dong, Zheng Xi, Seven Heroes and Five Justices, Water Margin, Ji Gong Zhuan, Jing Hua Yuan, etc. Of course, there were also things that were concisely described, but the textbooks used by the storytellers had many typos and broken sentences, and there were also many long, dry vegetable-like sandwiched articles. So, in order to quickly know the content of the story, on the one hand, I had to adopt the "kill the robbers" principle for the unfamiliar words in the book - for example, "咱" and "喒" I would read them as "自" and "咎" and read them like that for three years - on the other hand, I had to adopt the "running horse policy" and quickly skim over the descriptions in the story that I thought were unimportant. As a result, the way I read novels was like this, and when I read non-fiction, I couldn't help but do the same. I remember that we read three volumes of English at that time. The unfamiliar words in the first two volumes could be recited in order from the first word on the first page to the last page, but the unfamiliar words in the third volume could not only not be recited, but even the pronunciation could not be spelled to seventy or eighty percent. I could only know a vague general idea of ​​the books I read, and I could never answer clearly when asked about the content.</p>
<p>Fourth, it caused irreparable damage to my body: Many of the descriptions in the novels I read were extremely bad, and there were many explicit and implicit hints that urged premature maturity, making me, as a young man, feel as sore in my waist and legs as an old man. When I think about it now, I can't help but feel pain and regret. The danger of indiscriminately reading without selection is more terrible than poisonous snakes and beasts for young people who have unstable minds and strong curiosity.</p>
<p>Xi Cong, I am still afraid when I think back to my situation in elementary school. In a word, I hope you will not follow in my footsteps!</p>
<p>The above words are my thoughts and bad experiences. Now I will talk to you about reading methods from a positive aspect.</p>
<p>The purpose of reading is firstly to seek knowledge, and secondly to tell others what you know. Seeking knowledge is to seek clear and clear knowledge. In other words, the books you read must be completely understood. After understanding, you should add criticism based on the knowledge you have gained elsewhere. Some people say that the criticism of those who lack knowledge - even if it refers to a junior high school student like you - is incorrect. Incorrect criticism is still better than no criticism. In fact, this logic is wrong: we must know that there is no end to knowledge. If middle school students cannot criticize, then how can college students be considered capable of criticism in the eyes of scholars? Even those who are recognized as so-called scholars, in the endless progress of science, can they always make unchanging criticisms? Criticism is the axe that forges knowledge. The more you know, the more accurate your criticism will be. Constantly seeking knowledge and constantly criticizing is the way to read. Just seeking knowledge without making expressions, as mentioned above, is the reading method of a useless bookworm. Although the expression may not necessarily be a mature thought, if you don't practice the ability to express, even when your thoughts are mature, you will not be able to use skillful methods to express them.</p>
<p>Based on this simple principle, whenever you read an article or a book, you must first pay attention to two points: first, what is the structure of the article? Second, what is the idea of ​​the article? You must analyze and review it carefully. Therefore, you must prepare a reading notebook. After reading, you must make a report. Although this report is not necessarily for anyone to see, after a while, you can know whether these reports are correct or wrong, because your planned reading will definitely gradually increase your knowledge and make your criticism more accurate.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Preface to "A Collection of Cool Songs" <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Gai Zun</p>
<p>When Venerable Hongyi had not yet become a monk, he excelled in all artistic endeavors. He was uniquely accomplished in calligraphy, painting, music, literature, drama, and seal carving. He once told me that he had worked the hardest on music throughout his life, as musical theory and performance cannot be mastered without long-term practice, unlike other artistic pursuits that can rely on talent. The Venerable taught music in Hangzhou and Nanjing for ten years, and today, nineteen music teachers across the country are his disciples. His compositions and songs are popular throughout the country and are considered masterpieces. After entering the mountains, all previous pursuits became a dream. One day, Liu Zhiping and I visited the Venerable at a mountain temple. After lunch, we chatted casually and touched upon contemporary music education. Zhiping sighed at the difficulty of finding songwriters, lamenting the prevalence of vulgar songs in the streets and alleys, and deeply regretting the Venerable's early entry into the mountains. The Venerable was also moved and agreed to write more songs, which surprised and delighted Zhiping and me. This happened seven years ago. In the past seven years, Zhiping and his fellow students have composed music for the Venerable's lyrics, carefully refining them until they were approved by the Venerable. After performances at the Shanghai Former Xinhua Art School and the Zhejiang Ningbo Middle School, they brought the manuscript to me, seeking publication. There are five composers: Zhiping is the Venerable's disciple; Xue Yong, Xi Yi, and Bo Ying are Zhiping's disciples; and Xu Tang is Zhiping's great-grandson. All are outstanding figures in the field of music education. There are only five songs, but they are the result of collaborative efforts between teachers and disciples in the music world, spanning seven years. This is also a remarkable story in Chinese music history. The song is named "Coolness," as the Venerable commanded. The Venerable's lay surname is Li, his given name is Xi, his courtesy name is Shutong, and another courtesy name is Xishuang. He is from Pinghu, Zhejiang.</p>
<h3 id="e123">"Extinction" Seventh Edition Postscript <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>"Extinction" is my first published work, written in 1928. Now, eight years have passed. Recently, taking advantage of the seventh edition, I read it carefully, deleted and revised many parts, and handed it to the bookstore for a revised and reset edition. I had the idea to revise this book three or four years ago, but other things entangled me, preventing me from fulfilling my wish. Today, after reading the proofs sent by the bookstore, I feel very happy, feeling as if I have finally accomplished something.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, other thoughts arose in me. I seemed to have returned to the time when I was writing this book. Regarding the motivation and process of writing this book, I have described it in detail in my article "A Review of My Writing Life." This article has been included in my first collection of short stories, so it is not convenient to include it here. I also wrote a diary at that time, but it was lost in the January 28th Incident. I also wrote an "Author's Confession of Extinction," which was a response to some critics. There was a large passage in it describing my attitude when creating the typical character of Du Daxin, which I feel can be quoted here:</p>
<p>"When I wrote about Du Daxin's thoughts, I adopted a completely objective attitude and did not completely infuse my own thoughts into it. Although I am not a believer in Du Daxin, I love him, and my attitude towards him is very fair. I wrote about his strengths, but I also wrote about his weaknesses. However, the criticism from Mr. Gang Goren is somewhat unfair. He said that Du Daxin's 'motivation for participating in the revolution is incorrect. He uses work to suppress his depression and uses the revolution to express his personal ideals.' I admit that Du Daxin 'is a romantic revolutionary,' which is true, but to say that his motivation for participating in the revolution is incorrect is too unfair to him. The reason why he became a romantic revolutionary and the reason why he hated humanity are due to his environment and his lung disease. 'What a despicable thing man is!' If Du Daxin had said this sentence like Sanin, he would have the right to do so. His participation in the revolution is one thing, and his use of work to suppress his depression is another. It is not because he wants to suppress his depression that he participates in the revolution. Man is a complex, organic thing, and people with lung disease are even more sensitive. After participating in the revolution, he cannot become a machine. His environment still makes him depressed, but he does not become disillusioned or give up everything. Of course, he can only use work to suppress his depression. I myself once received a letter from a friend in China who said that he was in great pain and was 'using busyness as intoxication.' Isn't this the same as Du Daxin? As for Du Daxin's death, I think it is inevitable. Mr. Gang said, 'Sacrificing one's own life and seeking revenge merely because a friend's friend was killed... is not the attitude that a revolutionary should have.' However, if Mr. Gang thinks more deeply, he will definitely understand that Du Daxin only had one path in front of him: death. A person who hates humanity and hates himself will either kill or be killed, or commit suicide. In my opinion, he has no third option, especially since Du Daxin also has lung disease. Revenge is a minor matter. The most important thing is that his advanced lung disease made 'him begin to feel that this long-lasting suffering should stop. He wants to rest, he wants to rest permanently.' And in fact, for him, 'only death can bring him peaceful happiness' (page 330). The Russian politician Radek had a classmate in his youth who contracted an incurable disease. That person asked Radek to poison him with poison, but Radek did not agree. However, he wrote in his diary: 'Life that cannot be tolerated should be destroyed with violence.' He himself later committed suicide. Du Daxin 'knows that he is working hard to walk towards the road to death, and he clearly feels that death is approaching day by day.' Of course, he will take the path of destroying life with violence. I myself am against him taking this path, but I cannot stop him. I can only cry for his death."</p>
<p>On the first page of the first edition of "Extinction," I printed a dedication. I dedicated this book to my eldest brother, who was the first person who gave me the greatest help in my intellectual development. Now I have deleted this short dedication because my brother has left this world. I wrote this book for him to read in order to seek his understanding and let me go my own way with peace of mind. However, we finally separated forever without understanding each other.</p>
<p>I repeatedly flipped through the pages of the proofs in front of me, trying to find something on these glossy pages. I am afraid of recalling, but now I desperately seek help from recalling.</p>
<p>The cold wind of late spring blows in from the window. The surroundings are silent. The night is very late. What is the use of sitting alone in front of the window and writing articles? Can't I do something more useful?</p>

<p>— Ai Ji</p>
<p>... The Story of Chemistry and The Story of Arithmetic ...</p>
<p>Everyone knows that chemistry is one of the modern sciences, and at the same time, everyone admits that it was not produced out of thin air or by chance. But if asked about the state of chemistry around a certain century? Who were the chemists at that time? What memorable contributions did they make? And how did his contribution come about? Not everyone can answer that. For example, who discovered gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and chlorine? Which year was it discovered? What were the detailed processes and methods of discovery? These are all very valuable questions. But this can only be understood by those who have read the history of chemistry, I'm afraid no one can understand. Also, how did Cavendish discover nitric acid from the air? How did Dalton measure atomic weight? How did structural theory sprout? How did the concept of electrons and atomic structure arise? This is only possible in the history of chemistry, and it is definitely not a rigid chemistry textbook that can comprehensively and systematically tell us.</p>
<p>Speaking of textbooks, they can sometimes guide students to study various subjects, but sometimes they are also a major obstacle for students to study various subjects. Because its content is restricted by curriculum standards and other aspects, it is often just fragments of dead knowledge, not systematic and living knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, in order to enable general young students to gain systematic and lively knowledge of chemistry, I would like to introduce "The Story of Chemistry" (Kaiming Edition, priced at 55 cents) written by Japanese writer Masuyo Kura and translated by Ren Yibi. This is a concise history of chemistry with wonderful and essential content and fluent and smooth translation. It was also produced because the author was dissatisfied with school textbooks. This can be seen from a paragraph in the author's preface below:</p>
<p>"When I was teaching chemistry and physics at a normal school, I had a deep dissatisfaction with the textbooks... Students' interest in subjects is mostly in the hands of teachers, but now the textbooks seem to be restraining the teacher's skills. ... Chemistry is originally an interesting subject, but according to the content of the current textbooks, it is definitely impossible to satisfy students. To remedy this deficiency, it is indeed necessary to talk about the history of chemistry from a position different from that of the textbooks and in a way that has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The above is the purpose and position of the book. Now, let me briefly introduce its content: This book is divided into two parts, the former and the latter. The former part mainly describes Lavoisier and his era, while the latter part describes the era after Lavoisier. Before Lavoisier, chemistry was always in the barren burning flame of darkness, and could not get the illumination of light. Until the time of Lavoisier, he boldly overthrew the phlogiston theory that had dominated chemistry for hundreds of years. From then on, chemistry saw the light of day and developed from morning to the present state. Therefore, the author divides the history of chemistry into two periods. The former part has four chapters. The first chapter is "The Pioneers of Chemistry: Alchemy," which explains that chemistry originated from alchemy and gradually developed with the progress of alchemy. The second chapter is "Before Boyle," which explains the development of chemistry before Boyle and in his time. The third chapter is "The Theory of Combustion," which explains how the thoughts of chemists in the 100 years after Boyle were dominated by the absurd phlogiston theory and the process by which Schule and Priestley discovered oxygen. The fourth chapter is "The Construction of Modern Chemistry," which talks about Lavoisier's overthrow of the phlogiston theory and the contributions of other chemists of the same era to chemistry. The latter part is divided into eight chapters, namely "Davy and his Disciples," "The Development of Atomic and Molecular Theory," "The Origin of Element Symbols and Chemical Formulas," "Element Discovery and the Periodic Law," "The Past and Present of Solution Theory," "The Emergence of Ionization Theory," "The Size of Atoms and Molecules," and "The Chemical Revolution." We only need to read these eight chapters to systematically know the general course of chemistry from Lavoisier to the present.</p>
<p>In addition to all the wonderful content mentioned above, this book also contains several characteristics, which we should bring up and talk about: First, the content of general chemistry textbooks is selected based on the presence or absence of the results of chemists' experiments. Therefore, whether theoretically or experimentally, anything without results, or with poor results, or results that are contrary to common rules, is often discarded and not discussed. But in this book, both process and results are equally important, so it does not judge people by success or failure, and can allow readers to see the clues of the changes in chemical thought and observation. Second, people who compile ordinary chemistry textbooks often compile the many results created by chemists over hundreds or even thousands of years without any connection due to unavoidable reasons, trying to stuff these indigestible things into the brains of scholars, regardless of whether they will be digested or not, making chemistry a very unnatural machine. The compilation of this book does not have the above shortcomings. It definitely does not want us to force ourselves to memorize those stereotypical facts. Third, it can show us that chemistry is endless, and guide us to a broad road, teaching us to work hard to explore the treasure trove contained in chemistry. That's why I dare to introduce this book.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "The Story of Arithmetic" (Kaiming Edition, priced at 65 cents).</p>
<p>If we ask middle school students, "Do you like arithmetic?" then perhaps seven or eight out of ten of them will answer: "I don't like it very much," or some people will say: "I find it quite annoying." Since the college entrance examination system was established, arithmetic is probably also the subject with the most failing students. "Is arithmetic really a hateful subject? Why is it not easy to get close to people? Why is it not liked? Is there a way to remedy it? I can't help but have such questions.</p>
<p>"The pure abstractness of arithmetic is the most difficult to understand. The reason why most people dislike arithmetic and say that arithmetic is not easy to understand is probably at this point. And the arithmetic professors of the past have also focused on this point, so it will create a situation where people get more and more confused. Someone defines arithmetic as, if you don't ask what it is, you still understand, but if you ask what it is, you get more and more confused; this is to bring out the abstractness of arithmetic. For ordinary people, it is too abstract and indeed not easy to understand.</p>
<p>"However, does it have to be so abstract to be considered arithmetic? In shallow places, in practical social life, do we not often have arithmetic problems? Why must we learn the abstract and difficult-to-understand arithmetic in the books? This is where the failure of arithmetic education has always been. Ordinary people do not require such profound and abstract arithmetic, but those who teach arithmetic refuse to use concrete things to represent abstract things and give a clear reality. Thus, arithmetic has become an incomprehensible and difficult-to-understand subject that is disliked by people."</p>
<p>The above are two paragraphs from the preface of "The Story of Arithmetic" written by Mr. Zhang Kebiao. From this, we can know that arithmetic is not born to be hated by people and not easy to get close to. The reason is only that people do not know how to use it and study it well.</p>
<p>Recently, many people often use lively and lively writing styles to write arithmetic essays. For example, Mr. Liu Xunyu's "Mathematics Garden" and "Mathematical Fun." This kind of writing can very well arouse students' interest in studying arithmetic. This is indeed a good way to remedy the deficiencies of general arithmetic textbooks.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of homework you study, if you want to achieve twice the result with half the effort, then the method of research must first be from combination to division, and finally from division to combination; in other words, you must first use the method of induction to obtain all the important outlines of a certain subject, and then use the method of deduction to expand it, and finally use the method of induction to synthesize the various more broad and true knowledge. Only this kind of learning method can make the subject clear and easy to understand. The method of learning arithmetic should also be like this. You should first get a concept of the whole arithmetic, and then you can study it step by step. This book "The Story of Arithmetic" was produced in response to such a need. Please see what Mr. Zhang said: "This book is for young people to read outside of class. It seeks to be shallow and easy to understand, so it does not talk about arithmetic principles... It only pays attention to the general situation of its development... My humble intention is to increase the interest in arithmetic to some extent through this, and give a little nourishment to this dry and tasteless subject of arithmetic, so that arithmetic will not be regarded as an annoying subject."</p>
<p>Its compilation is like this: It takes the path of development of arithmetic as the backbone, and records the anecdotes and deeds of various famous mathematicians from ancient times to modern times, as well as the contributions of each person to arithmetic. It says very little about formal arithmetic principles, but it also pays attention to the causal relationship of how science rises and how it declines. Also, although it only records various characters on the surface, in essence, we can see the cultural and political background of that era, which is another characteristic of this book.</p>

<h3 id="e125">General Situation of Salt Administration Consolidation Since the Establishment of the National Government; Audit Agencies Concurrently Handle Anti-Smuggling Affairs; Unified Authority; Balanced Tax Rates; Increased Tax Revenue; Foreign Debts Can Be Cleared <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there have been many changes in China's salt administration, and the content is very complicated. Few people can thoroughly understand it. Since the Legislative Yuan passed the new salt law and the National Government promulgated it, how the new law is implemented and how the authorities have consolidated it in recent years have attracted the attention of society. A reporter specially visited a senior official of the Salt Administration Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance to ask about the consolidation of the salt administration and tax revenue since the establishment of the National Government. He provided a very detailed account, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Improving Organization</p>
<p>China's salt administration organization has separated administration and audit since 1923. The reason for this construction is that the audit agency is not without foreign debt contracts. However, since the establishment of the National Government, this restriction has been lifted, and it has always been enthusiastic and successful in consolidating the salt administration and rectifying tax revenue. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has successively transferred the administrative and anti-smuggling affairs of the eleven regions of Huaibei, Huainan, Zhe, Su, Lu, Min, Yu, Xiang, E, Xi, and Wan to Chinese auditors of the audit office for concurrent management in 1931 and 1932. Later, it was ordered by the Ministry to transfer the administrative and anti-smuggling agencies of Changlu, Northwest, and Sichuan to the audit agency for concurrent management, so as to unify authority and facilitate improvement. Although the concurrent management has not been long, the consolidation has achieved considerable results. In recent years, the progress of the consolidation of the salt administration and the obvious achievements are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Consolidating Anti-Smuggling Affairs</p>
<p>In the past, the malpractices of anti-smuggling were mostly in embezzlement, sale of posts, release of private goods, extortion, etc. Since the audit office received the anti-smuggling agencies of the eleven regions such as Huaibei, it reorganized the anti-smuggling camp into tax police, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong, and strictly training them. All appointments and dismissals of officials and police were handled in accordance with the personnel management regulations of the audit office to ensure job security, and independent military supplies were implemented, with roll calls and payments made. Clothing, firearms, and ammunition were also purchased and distributed by the audit office through bidding. The past malpractices were swept away. In recent years, the increase in the number of domestic sales of salt in these regions is indeed not as good as in other regions that have not been concurrently managed.</p>
<p>Consolidating Salt Fields</p>
<p>China's salt fields have never been managed properly, so smuggling is easy, and the loss of salt tax amounts to tens of millions of yuan every year. After the establishment of the Salt Administration Audit Office, the Changlu Guantuo was built. In recent years, enclosing walls, trenches, and roads have been added, and tax police outposts and field affairs offices have been set up in the field, so that in addition to storing salt, the beach production, transportation, and prevention of beach smuggling can be managed at the same time. In the past five years, various projects in Huaibei Tantuo have also been gradually equipped, beach smuggling has been sharply reduced, and Lu, Zhe, Su, and Min are also under construction. In the future, when various projects are completed, beach smuggling will be eliminated, and tax revenue will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Improving Transportation and Sales</p>
<p>For example, the wheel sales system on the four banks of the Yangtze River is the main reason for the sluggish sales of official salt. Now, restricted free trade is gradually being promoted as a preliminary step towards abolition, and Huai salt on the four banks, whether in the field or on the bank, is allowed to freely reduce prices within the statutory price to compete for sales. Transportation is also encouraged to save transportation costs. In addition, the franchise merchants in the two prefectures of Wenzhou and Chu in eastern Zhejiang and the three prefectures of Yanjian and Shao in Fujian have been abolished, and free trade has been implemented. Nanjing City and the four counties of Lintan, Fei, and Yi in Shandong have been opened as free trade zones to prepare for the implementation of the new salt law.</p>
<p>Suppressing Niter Salt</p>
<p>In the regions of Ji, Lu, and Yu, the loss of tax revenue due to the encroachment of niter soil salt each year amounts to more than 30 million yuan. In 1932, the Niter and Sulfur Bureaus of various provinces were merged into the audit office. By 1935, the income from niter and sulfur had increased more than fourfold. The niter salt produced from niter production is now generally dumped to prevent smuggling of salt for food. In the Changlu area, the local officials and fair gentry are also jointly advising the people to destroy the soil salt ponds, and at the same time, water conservancy is being carried out to change the soil quality and eliminate soil salt. The tax revenue in the district in 1935 increased by more than 3 million yuan compared with 1934. In Henan, the government allocated funds to jointly manage waterways and improve soil with the provincial authorities, and set up an agricultural experiment field to improve alkaline soil. The results were very significant. The most difficult problem of niter soil salt in the salt administration for thousands of years is expected to be solved.</p>
<p>Balanced Tax Rates</p>
<p>The salt tax rates were reorganized by the audit office after its establishment in 1913, and once tended to be tidy. Later, the country was in turmoil, the political situation was unstable, and the local governments took the lead in arbitrarily adding surcharges, resulting in different weights in each region. After the establishment of the National Government, it made great efforts to consolidate, first unifying the tax days and merging the various confusing and complicated names into categories. The field tax and central surtax paid in the producing area are collectively named the positive tax, and the bank tax and central surtax paid in the selling area are collectively named the sales tax. Later, the Ministry of Finance issued an order in 1933 stipulating that from January 1, 1934, all central positive and surtaxes and local surtaxes totaling more than 10 yuan per load should be reduced to 10 yuan uniformly. Those below 10 yuan should wait for consideration of the situation before gradually improving to equalize the burden. At present, the tax rates in each region have gradually become balanced, and all the long-standing bad rules have been fundamentally eliminated in recent years.</p>
<p>Increased Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The tax revenue in 1924 was more than 75 million yuan, which gradually increased over the years. By 1935, it was more than 183 million yuan, which can be attributed to the effectiveness of the audit office's concurrent management of administration and anti-smuggling. For example, in the fifteen years from 1914 to 1928, the total average tax revenue of the eleven regions such as Huaibei, which were concurrently managing administration and anti-smuggling, and the nine regions such as Guangdong, which were not concurrently managing, was more than 35 million yuan. By 1933, the former was more than 114 million yuan, and the latter was only 45 million yuan, a difference of as much as 70 million yuan. After 1933, due to the inclusion of the Changlu and Koubei districts, the former was more than 146 million yuan, and the latter was only more than 36 million yuan. The salt administration expenses have been reduced by 3.5 million yuan per year since the concurrent management of administration and anti-smuggling. In recent years, although the duties of the audit agency have increased, the expenses have been reduced as much as possible. The budget for administrative expenses in 1935 was less than 5% of the tax revenue, while the increase in police in anti-smuggling and the purchase of firearms were higher than before.</p>
<p>Reduced Foreign Debt</p>
<p>After 1913, the salt tax was originally the sole guarantee for the post-war large loan, and this led to the gradual interference of foreigners in the salt administration. After the establishment of the National Government, in addition to maintaining national sovereignty and reforming the management of the audit office, all foreign debt matters were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, and the audit office only managed tax revenue. The guarantee for the post-war loan was transferred to the customs revenue item to earn salt tax and enrich the national use. At present, the foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax are only the British-French loan, the Crisp loan, and the Hubei-Guangdong loan, which can be repaid separately within a few years. In summary, the progress of China's salt administration since the establishment of the National Government has been rapid, and the achievements have been remarkable, which was unprecedented before. At present, the Legislative Yuan has adopted a one-yuan system for the salt administration organization, which is in line with political principles. If this consistent spirit is followed and the same consolidation is carried out in all regions of the country, the results will be even more impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Banking Sector Agrees to Handle National Rice Transportation Loans; The Amount Should Be Determined Next Week; Grain Merchants Very Much Hope for Unified Cooperation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, this year's national rice harvest is abundant. In order to prevent the decline in grain prices from harming farmers, the government has ordered the banking sector to earnestly handle transportation loans to provide relief. It is reported that the banks are now negotiating to handle it collectively. Grain merchants also hope that the government and the banking sector will cooperate and coordinate. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Unstable Market Prices</p>
<p>In recent days, the market for miscellaneous grains has been fluctuating, and the rise and fall are unpredictable. The reason is nothing more than the influence of foreign merchants and gardeners' monopoly. However, normal merchants still hope that the government authorities will take effective measures to stabilize market prices and ensure people's food supply. According to inquiries from grain merchants, the fluctuation of miscellaneous grains this time is not caused by the normal supply relationship. For example, the price of rice soared by more than one yuan a few days ago, and then dropped by more than one yuan recently. In addition, the prices of flour and wheat have been rising sharply together, but recently the price of wheat is still rising, while the price of flour has fallen. This is indeed a rare and abnormal development in the food market.</p>
<p>Earnestly Unified Measures</p>
<p>It was further stated that in this extraordinary period, there are earnest and unified measures in both production and transportation. This is what our legitimate grain merchants are eagerly hoping for. At present, the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Finance and Finance are both paying close attention to the matter of grain and are gradually promoting it. The banking group is also gradually increasing the amount of loans released to rural areas. However, this matter should eventually have an earnest and unified method. Whether it is in transportation or production, there should be close contact. If the government and merchants can cooperate, the effect will be greater. In the future, it is hoped that the government and grain merchants will cooperate in transportation, and the government and the banking sector will cooperate in production loans. Everything will still be planned by the government in a unified manner, which can avoid the monopoly of foreign merchants and prevent the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. If so, the food market can be stabilized and the future of the people's food supply can be optimistic.</p>
<p>Banking Sector Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>The banks in the city have received orders from the Ministry of Finance to handle national rice transportation loans as much as possible to develop rural areas and regulate the people's food supply. According to the reporter's investigation, the banking sector attaches great importance to this. Previously, the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank suggested centralized handling, which was approved by the banks. More than ten banks gathered responsible persons in the Bank of China on the 15th to discuss.

<h3 id="e127">Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request for Clarification: Start Date for Taxing Business Profits <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance requesting clarification on the starting date for taxing business profits. The original petition stated: Regarding the matter of submitting a request, it is noted that on the 14th of this month, a letter from Changming Electric Company stated that, upon investigation of Article 1, Clause 1 of the Income Tax Regulations, Category 1 covers income from businesses, commercial firms, shops, and factories, or individual capital exceeding 2,000 yuan; furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's directive, Categories 1, 2, and 3, and all other income types, are to be taxed starting from January 1, 1937. Moreover, Rule 26 of the Detailed Rules for Implementing Income Tax stipulates that the tax payment deadline for both Categories A and B should be based on each industry's annual settlement period. Investigations reveal that each industry's annual settlement period varies, with some in June and others in December. For those in June, the shareholders' meeting is invariably held in August or September; for those in December, the shareholders' meeting is invariably held in March or April of the following year. While there is no issue for commercial firms that traditionally distribute dividends at the end of the year, companies organized according to company law must distribute dividends only after the shareholders' meeting, if there is a surplus. Now, the income tax for Category 1, Item A, and Category 3 (stock dividends) is to be levied from January 1, 1937. For companies settling accounts in December, the dividend distribution period is indeed after the tax start date, but the actual income is from profits earned before the end of December 1936. Laws should not be retroactive. Therefore, all companies settling accounts in December 1936 should not be required to pay income tax uniformly. For those with a settlement period in June of the following year, income tax should be levied for six months of income from 1937. Furthermore, the income tax on interest from deposits was originally scheduled to start on October 1st of this year. According to the Ministry of Finance's order, the interest income earned before October 1st is still to be fully distributed and exempt from taxation. Thus, the situation is the same for Category 1, Item A (business profits), and Category 3 (stock dividends). The Ministry's order to start taxation from January 1, 1937, must mean that only income earned after January 1st should be taxed. It should be stipulated that business profits and stock dividends earned before December 31, 1936, are exempt from taxation, which is in line with legal principles and factual circumstances. With the end of the year approaching, it is easy to cause misunderstandings when companies settle accounts. Therefore, we offer our opinion and request that your association submit this matter for discussion, present it to the Ministry of Finance, and announce a clear method that aligns with legal principles and reflects reality. Upon arrival at the meeting, it was noted that, apart from civil servant salaries and securities interest, all other income taxes are to be levied from January 1, 1937, as per the Ministry's general order. The meaning of starting taxation from January 1st should refer to the taxation of income earned from January 1st onwards, and not retroactively taxing income earned before January 1st. This is made even clearer by referring to the provisions of Article 26, Section 1 of the Detailed Implementation Rules. For Category 1, Items A and B, the business profits earned from January 1, 1937, onwards, if the settlement period is at the end of June, according to the provisions of Section 1 of that article, should be paid in one lump sum from August 1st to the end of October. This means that starting taxation from January 1st refers to clearly delineating the before and after boundaries of business profits, and does not mean that from January 1st, the business profits of 1936 must be retroactively paid together. The difference in this matter is significant. Based on the information in the letter, it is appropriate to prepare an official document to submit to your ministry for review and approval, and to provide clarification for compliance, which is beneficial to the public.</p>

<h3 id="e131">British Credit Loan to China: Total Amount is £10 Million, Stable Foreign Exchange After the Loan is Successful <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the British credit loan to China, the New Voice News Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday morning that the total amount of the credit loan is said to be £10 million. This is the result of negotiations between Mr. Leith-Ross, the special envoy dispatched by Britain to China to investigate the economic situation, and the Chinese financial authorities. Although Mr. Leith-Ross has returned home, his assistants who came to China, Mr. Hall Patch (currently the financial advisor to the British Embassy in China) and Mr. Rogers (currently an advisor to the Chinese Ministry of Finance), are both in Shanghai. This credit loan is not cash; it involves British goods. The British trade in goods with China will inevitably be more prosperous than before. When Mr. Leith-Ross was in China, the total amount discussed was £20 million, but now it has been reduced by half to £10 million. After the credit loan is successful, China's foreign exchange can be further stabilized, which will benefit both China and Britain and will not have much impact on China's banking sector.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Notary Office of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on August 1st of this year, many people have requested notarization. However, because this system is still new, requesters may not be clear about the procedures, which may cause difficulties. In order to facilitate the general public, the court authorities have specially printed a Notarization Guide, which lists the current laws and regulations on notarization in our country, the organization of the notarization agency, the procedures for requesting notarization, etc., in a categorized and summarized manner, in the form of a table, so that readers can understand it at a glance.

<h3 id="e147">Villagers' Appeal: Difficulty Paying for Encroached Land <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Because Jia Fujin lacks the funds to pay, they request no violation of the land outline. After the Shanghai Land Bureau surveyed the Yangjing area of Pudong, villagers were initially encouraged to exchange certificates because any encroached land could be temporarily approved for use. However, after Director Cai completely overturned the regulations regarding certificate application requirements, any encroached land now requires increased taxes and payment, otherwise, new certificates will never be issued. Consequently, those with substantial properties and profitable businesses can comply, but impoverished farmers whose land has been passed down through generations have no choice but to sell their homes to cover the Land Bureau's fees, or they cannot enjoy the rights of a landowner. The current landowner, Jia Dangjin, lacks the means to pay for the encroached land and has petitioned for its removal. The original petition is recorded below: A petition to request the Shanghai Land Bureau be instructed to approve the removal of encroached land to alleviate the people's hardship. I, a resident of 86 Jiajiage Road, Yangjing, Pudong, Shanghai, wish to register my ancestral home with the Land Bureau's certificate exchange office in December of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. I request an exchange for a new certificate. However, the bureau's staff claimed that the blueprint had been taken by Zhou Shaowen and asked that Zhou be notified to bring his certificate to the bureau for verification before a new certificate could be issued. This was delayed until February of this year when the blueprint was finally verified. Later, I received Land Bureau document number 将字第二二一, a notice stating, "... it is necessary to pay 125 yuan for the encroached land." However, due to rural bankruptcy in recent years and the lack of available work, I am unable to pay. I have repeatedly requested that the land be removed. I subsequently received Land Bureau document number 乙字第二五一九, which stated, "Received the petition... For the sake of maintaining complete household plots, the removal will not be permitted, and the price should be paid according to regulations." Given the current economic downturn, the lack of earning capacity, and the absence of property to sell, I am forced to cut into my own flesh to heal the wound, willing to request the removal of the encroached land. The Shanghai Land Bureau has repeatedly changed directors, and with each change, the regulations are altered. Previously, Article 12 of the Certificate Application Requirements stipulated that the use of a few fen or li of encroached land would be temporarily approved. Now, Director Cai has completely overturned this. The Land Bureau is now ignoring everything and rejecting the petition, which not only contradicts the purpose of the survey but also violates Article 19 of the Land Outline issued by the Executive Yuan's Order No. 3517 for general implementation, which states, "All land without tax or land with more land than tax will not be investigated retroactively, and free tax increases will be permitted without collecting supplementary tax fees or handling fees," and Article 28, "Land without a contract that has been peacefully occupied for a long time and is certified by neighbors as meeting the requirements of civil law shall be handled according to regulations." Therefore, I respectfully submit this petition, earnestly requesting your approval and instructing the Shanghai Land Bureau to approve the removal of the encroached land to alleviate the people's hardship, which would be a great kindness. Presented to Executive Yuan President Jiang and Vice President Kong, by petitioner Jia Fujin.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Da Hua Opium Case: Rescue Efforts Spread Like Wildfire; Shipping Association Cables Haimen Authorities to Rescue the Innocent and Avoid Implication <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ping An Shipping Company's Wintai liner, Da Hua, departed Shanghai for Taiwan. When the ship arrived in Haimen, military police searched the ship and found a large quantity of opium in passenger Jiang Xinglian's luggage inside the chief mate Chuan Runian's cabin. The passenger, the chief mate, and the opium were taken to the Joint Investigation Office and transferred to the Fourth District Anti-Opium Brigade for interrogation. Brigade Commander Su interrogated Jiang Xinglian, who admitted to smuggling opium. Chief Mate Chuan Runian was interrogated and found to have no involvement in the case. Jiang Xinglian was punished according to the law, and Chuan Runian was found innocent and released back to the ship. This occurred on the 5th of this month. On the 6th, military police returned to the Da Hua and rearrested Chief Mate Chuan Runian. Because the opium was found in the chief mate's cabin, not in the passenger's cabin, suspicion arose. He was detained until the ship sailed and has not yet been released. The Da Hua returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the shipowner reported the incident to the company, requesting assistance in rescuing the chief mate. Simultaneously, a petition was submitted to the Shipping Industry Association requesting assistance. Chuan Runian has served Da Hua with loyalty and honesty and has never committed any offenses. The Shipping Industry Association has also conducted an investigation and confirmed that Chuan Runian was unaware of the opium smuggling and had no involvement. Therefore, Mr. Chu Qiaqing drafted a telegram to the Haimen authorities, proving that Chief Mate Chuan was not involved in the case, requesting his prompt release and avoiding implicating the innocent.</p>

<h3 id="e151">The Headless Trunk Murder Case: Separate Interrogations Were Conducted Yesterday; The Two Accused Still Retract Their Confessions; Witness Yi Caiying Did Not Arrive at Cunfuli; Whether Lin Gendi Has a Mental Disorder Awaits Examination; Bloodstains on the Bed Board and Bloodstains on the Reed Mat Need to Be Analyzed <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Since the occurrence of the headless trunk murder case, because the statements obtained from the arrested suspects Lin Gendi, Mao A'gen, and Jiang Yuanxian were inconsistent, and after admitting to their involvement, they later retracted their confessions, repeated interrogations have failed to reach a resolution. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing of the Special First Court continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The courtroom was still packed with spectators. First, lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station stated that on the 3rd of this month, when the police brought Lin to court, Mao A'gen's wife told Lin that during the court hearing, he must say that the murder occurred on August 8th, not on the 9th. After the court hearing, Mao's wife punched Lin Gendi.</p>
<p>One Punch</p>
<p>He also claimed that when Caiying was killed, a piece of red clothing was hung on the door, and Mao et al. immediately ordered Lin to wear it to avoid bloodstains on his body. On August 13th, Lin Gendi asked his mother, Lin Xu, whether the dead person's clothes could be worn. His mother scolded him severely. Today, Lin Xu is also in court. Zheng Debao and Cao Houqing from the Great New Company are also present and should be questioned. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, Hua Detective Huang Fusen, who was in charge of this case, reported to West Detective Ma Ya, asking Mao to tell him that if</p>
<p>Can Not Be Punished</p>
<p>Then 400 yuan can be raised, and the money can be borrowed from Firefighter No. 1 of the Xinzha Fire Brigade, etc. Therefore, the three defendants in this case should be interrogated separately. The court approved it. First, Lin Gendi was questioned. According to the testimony, Mao A'gen's wife ordered me to say that the murder date was on the 8th, otherwise she would beat me. Therefore, last time I confessed that it was on the 8th, but it was actually on August 9th. At that time, Mao and Jiang were definitely present. After the last court hearing, Mao's wife punched me in the chest, etc. The court immediately summoned Lin Gendi's mother to court. According to the testimony, her husband's family name is actually Yue, not Lin. She lives at 32 Huazhen Lane, Xinjiang Road. Lin Gendi</p>
<p>Is Her Own Daughter</p>
<p>Her surname was actually changed by herself. At 12:00 AM on August 13th of this year, my daughter suddenly came to me and said that firefighters had sent her a few pieces of old clothes and asked if the dead person's clothes could be worn. I replied no and slapped her on the face. She immediately lay on the ground. I don't know where she usually lives at night. She is considered an idiot, and people call her "Thirteen O'Clock". Sometimes she often sleeps on the road, etc. When Lin Gendi was questioned, he said that what his mother said was correct. Then, witness Hongsheng testified that he was an inspector at the Great New Company and that he and Lin</p>
<p>Gendi's Mother</p>
<p>Are old neighbors. Lin's original name was Tao Li, and she was known as "Thirteen O'Clock." When the police came to the Great New Company to investigate, they asked if anyone remembered Lin and whether Caiying had ever worked as a hostess. Nothing was known, etc. Mao A'gen's lawyer Fan Gang immediately stated that on the 3rd of this month, this lawyer disguised himself as a tourist and went to the Great New Company to investigate. According to Zhu Fenglan, a Yangzhou class No. 1 hostess, anyone who works as a hostess must have someone to introduce them. Therefore, Zheng should be asked about this. However, according to Zheng's answer, at the opening, there was a shortage of hostesses, and anyone who wanted to work was welcomed, so there was no need for an introduction, etc. Li, Shanghai Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>North Station Branch</p>
<p>Police Officer Shi Tingyu No. 2129 and Police Officer Bi Futting No. 2136 and Police Officer Liu Haicun No. 2147 submitted cases one after another, proving that the police detectives once took Mao, Jiang, etc. with Yu and others to the accident site, No. 3 Cunfuli, and the prisoners led the way, etc. Furthermore, Zhang Guoliang, an inspector of the Great New Company, proved that Lin Gendi had indeed worked as a hostess at the company and was dismissed for stealing someone else's wallet, etc. The court then summoned the person in charge of the alley in Cunfuli, Ye Yu, to the case. According to the testimony, only an old woman, Feng Zhang, lived in the pavilion room at No. 3 in that alley, and no hostess</p>
<p>Caiying Rented</p>
<p>Etc., Later, Feng Zhang testified that she lived in Ningbo and came to Shanghai on March 22 of the old calendar [lunar]. She lived in the pavilion room at No. 2 Cunfuli. My daughter, Yu Feng, later agreed with the alley manager to temporarily live in the pavilion room at No. 3 because the weather was hot. She returned to Ningbo on the 7th of the first lunar month, and no hostess lived there during this period. Take the clothes and belongings home, I asked Yue Xu, and she said that the clothes were not taken back, only asking if the clothes of the dead could be worn, etc. I don't know about the rest. Also according to Zheng Debao (that is, Xiao Debao, testified that he was the tea hall leader at the Yangzhou Theatre of the Great New Company, and Lin Gendi had worked there as a waitress for about a month or so. She usually has a "Thirteen O'Clock" appearance. When the company opened, there were</p>
<p>Hundreds of entries and exits</p>
<p>Therefore, the hostesses of the "wild chicken class" [prostitutes] could not be among them, and there were no such people living in the houses on the left and right. The bed I sleep on is made of three wooden boards. The wooden board that the police station is handling is the one I sleep on. The court immediately asked that the board currently</p>
<p>Tested For Bloodstains</p>
<p>Where did the bloodstains come from? The answer may be the blood of bedbugs, or it may be unknown. The court asked Lin Gendi, do you know this person? Have you ever been to No. 3 Cunfuli? Answer, I sleep inside every day, and I have never seen Lin Gendi there, so I don't know each other, etc. According to the testimony of that woman's daughter, Yu Feng, she lived in the pavilion room at No. 2 Cunfuli after the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932], and no hostess lived in No. 3, and no one lived in the houses on the left and right who worked as a hostess, etc. Judge Zhong then ordered Jiang Yuanxian to be brought to the case. According to his testimony, I did not kill Caiying. The previous confession was</p>
<p>Due to Torture</p>
<p>Caused. The court then asked if it was a fact that he had confessed to having an affair with Caiying in the police station, as introduced by Lin Gendi, and then staying in room 102 of the Jinhai Hotel. He replied that it was not the case. Then, Detective Huang Fusen reported to the Jintai Hotel to investigate the situation, saying that on September 21, at 11:05 to 11:50 a.m., he took Jiang Yuanying to the Jintai Hotel at 231 Fuzhou Road. Because Jiang could not remember the name he wrote at the time, it was impossible to investigate. Lawyer Fan Gang immediately stated that according to the forensic doctor's examination, the headless corpse,</p>
<p>Suffers From a Venereal Disease</p>
<p>Therefore, please ask the court to re-examine the blood on the bed board to see if it is the same. Jiang Yuanying's lawyer Shen Laoxiang asked that the bloodstains left on the box containing the corpse and the reed mat containing the head be tested and compared with the blood on the bed board to see if they were of the same type, because if they were not of the same type, then the case could be easily solved. The court agreed. When Mao A'gen was questioned, he still insisted that he had been framed, saying that he did not know what Caiying looked like or what her figure was like, so how could he have killed her. Lin Gendi had previously heard that my salary was quite high, so she wanted to marry me, but because she</p>
<p>Looks Like an Idiot</p>
<p>And had an affair with a firefighter from No. 561. One night, Lin came to see me at the Xinzha Fire Brigade. I happened to be upstairs, and two firefighters, No. 300 and No. 802, were sleeping at the door. Lin actually fondled their genitals, and the two were startled and told me. I scolded Lin severely and forbade her to come again next time, which led to a grudge and framed me, etc. But Lin denied it. Lawyer Fan immediately asked the court to send Lin Gendi to a doctor for examination to see if she really had a mental illness and psychological abnormality, because according to the testimony of the witnesses, Lin really had a mental illness. Judge Zhong reviewed the report and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing at 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month. Lin Gendi should be sent to the Forensic Medicine Research Institute to diagnose whether she has a mental illness before further verification.</p>

The institute replied to the Bean and Rice Trade Association yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter stating that the use of overweight pecks by the peck officers is causing endless harm and requesting a notice to prohibit and correct this, we have approved this. Overweight and underweight pecks are both illegal. The Municipal Social Bureau has fairly stipulated the standards, and public pecks with missing half-pecks are available at both the North and South City offices. If a dispute arises over overweight or underweight pecks, it can be reported to the office, and the rice will be fairly measured with the public peck. If it exceeds the standard, the authorities will be immediately petitioned to punish them severely according to the law. As for the so-called 'retaining a sample,' it has always been disallowed. Now, as before, we will issue a notice to the North and South City industries to consistently follow the established cases. We should hereby respond and hope you will note this for our information."</p>

<p>After Ge Guanfu, a worker in the letterpress department of this newspaper, was tragically murdered on the 13th of this month, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, the court sent personnel to inspect the scene, and the family handled the funeral arrangements. A grand funeral was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, and many colleagues from this newspaper went to offer condolences. However, it was found that Mr. Ge's family was in dire straits, leaving behind an elderly mother, a younger sister, and a young daughter. At the same time, the executive committee of this newspaper, in view of Mr. Ge's tragic death and the fact that the murderer is still at large, has submitted a petition yesterday to the Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, ordering a strict investigation and arrest of the murderer. The text of the petition is recorded as follows: "For the murder of a husband, the murderer is at large, we earnestly request that you uphold humanity, immediately forward this petition to the Municipal Police Bureau, and swiftly arrest the murderer to uphold human life. Ge Guanfu, a worker of this newspaper, at about 3:00 p.m. on the 13th of this month, at his residence at No. 11 Sandu Lane, Daji Road, Nanshi, was murdered by his adulterous wife Liu Xiangbao and her lover, Mr. Lin, who conspired to chop his neck with a kitchen knife, killing him on the spot.

However, it has been found that the location of the case is within the jurisdiction of the Ximen Branch of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau. If the adulterer and adulteress are allowed to remain at large, not only will the deceased suffer injustice in the afterlife, but all the members of the union, as colleagues, who witnessed the tragic scene, will also feel ashamed towards the deceased friend. Therefore, we have no choice but to submit this petition to your union, to immediately forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to instruct its subordinates, and to issue a document to the police authorities of the special district to quickly arrest the murderer, to bring the adulterer and adulteress to justice as soon as possible, to punish them according to the law, to uphold human life, and to maintain law and order. We await your orders with respect. Submitted to the Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union." Furthermore, it is reported that after the Ge Guanfu case occurred, his relatives went to the Public Security Bureau to report that before Ge Guanfu died, Liu had instructed her cousin Guo Jufu (over twenty years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 9 Fude Lane, Wuzhen Road, Zhabei) to bring four conditions: (1) No abuse allowed, (2) Mother-in-law and husband's sisters not allowed to visit (Ge has three sisters, two married, and one sister who is only thirteen years old), (3) Move to another place of residence, (4) Pay a certain amount of living expenses each month. Ge believed that he could not neglect his mother or abandon his sisters, and that the conditions were harsh, so he did not agree. These conditions are still with Guo, who intends to negotiate further. Guo Jufu's mother received six hundred yuan in rent in her village when Guo was eleven years old. At that time, Guo and his father were both in Shanghai, and Liu was not yet married. She sent a letter to Shanghai, saying that Guo's mother had died suddenly. Guo rushed back to his wife's home for the funeral. When he held his mother's head while placing her in the coffin, blood gushed out from her neck, which had also been severed. Ge Guanfu's death was a replica of this. After investigation by the detective team, it was determined that Guo Jufu's past and the circumstances of his mother's unjust death, Liu's participation in Guo's mother's funeral before she was married, and her husband's current tragic death, made it necessary to investigate Guo Jufu. Therefore, Guo was arrested and interrogated the day before yesterday.</p>

The price increase notice is recorded as follows: "To whom it may concern, the price of Liuyang firecrackers has recently risen sharply, and since the beginning of autumn, due to fear of the Yangtze River drying up, transportation costs have increased. The cost of transporting goods to Shanghai has increased. Therefore, in order to maintain capital, the industry has no choice but to slightly increase the original selling price. It has been jointly decided that from October 15th of the Gregorian calendar, the prices will be sold at a 70% discount on the original code price. Please take note."</p>

<p>More than 20% of those examined within a month are patients. Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road in this city, in order to promote tuberculosis prevention work, has specially organized lung X-ray examinations.

A total of 96 students were examined, and more than 19% of them had lung diseases. This phenomenon among a small number of students is truly alarming.

It is reported that the hospital has submitted the examination results to the Social Bureau and the Health Bureau for statistics and has decided to continue to give preferential treatment to all sectors of society to promote popularization.</p>

The scene was extremely tragic. After investigation, the railway officials instructed the local bailiff to report to the local court and request an inquest.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Extortion Case Against the Manager of the Huiguo Ball Field: The French Police File a Public Prosecution, Accusing Him of Two Crimes: Extortion by Intimidation and Forgery of Seals; Yang Yiping Claims He Has Never Been Involved with the Ball Field <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The manager of the Central Huili Ball Field on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, the Spaniard Yasuosen (transliteration), previously received extortion letters from bandits demanding 500,000 yuan, stating that those who were willing to negotiate in good faith could contact Huang Yuanliang at the Dongya Hotel. He immediately reported this to the French police, who prepared a letter of consent to negotiate and placed it in the Dongya Hotel. Detectives, led by Zhou Buguang, waited. On the 30th of last month, Yang Yiping went to retrieve the letter and was immediately arrested, brought back, and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. During the investigation, it was also discovered that Yang had written a letter to Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city in the name of Song Yuanyuan, who resided at No. 89 Feifangfang, requesting relief. Wu sent his secretary, surnamed Guo, to meet with him, invited Yang to a meal, and gave him one yuan for pocket money. He also wrote a letter in the name of Ye Zujin to Deputy Director Yuan Chongzhi of the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan, requesting assistance. The French Police Department believed that the case was complex and that the investigation would take time, so it requested the Second Special Court to postpone the trial. The investigation by the French Police Department has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court presided over the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahua, the lawyer representing the French Police Department, stated that the defendant wrote extortion letters, demanding 500,000 yuan from the plaintiff. The words in the letter were all detrimental to the plaintiff. In addition, it was discovered that the defendant forged a seal in the name of Song Yuanyuan, wrote a letter to Mayor Wu, and defrauded him of money. He is now being prosecuted under Articles 346 and 217 of the Criminal Law for extortion by intimidation and forgery of seals. The defendant Yang Yiping stated that he had never been to the Huili Ball Field and knew nothing about the extortion letters. He came to Shanghai to escape marriage and was living in the Dongya Hotel, owing rent that he could not pay. Because he was starving, he wrote letters to Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Xu, requesting help. Last month, he saw a letter from Huang Yuanliang at the Dongya Hotel and remembered that he had a classmate named Huang Yuanliang in the Philippines, so he took the letter and was arrested. At this point, the court noted that the police report was lengthy and that there was no time to review it in detail, so the hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 23rd. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e168">French Police Crack Down on Cricket Gambling Den: Ye Mingji Sentenced to One Month Imprisonment; Assistants and Gamblers Fined <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The French Police, led by West Detective Biel (transliteration) and Chinese Detective Liu Kunbao, learned a few days ago that a rogue named Zhang Laosan was recently running a private cricket gambling den at No. 80, Lane 125, Caishi Road. Every night, many people were lured into the den to gamble, and the wins and losses were quite large. The owner collected 15 cents for every yuan bet, making a substantial profit. There was a strict ban on gambling, so at noon that day, the police, along with detectives Chen Tinghuai, Yuan Zhonghe, and Chen Zhiban, rushed to the address and searched the premises. The gambling boss, Zhang Laosan, had already fled upon hearing the news. Only the bookkeeper Ye Mingji, the assistants Gu Peigen, Su Pingan, Cai Heshang, Ma Huaide, Zhao Renbao, Zhang Gongjian, Mu Xiaoshan, Qin Liansheng, and thirty-three gamblers, including Huang Shen and Lu Chunting (who work at the China Merchants Automobile Company), Yu Xingen, and others, were apprehended. Twenty-four cricket jars, basins, and fighting cages, as well as more than forty yuan in gambling money in the form of large and small banknotes and copper coins, were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Branch Court for trial. Judge Qiu presided over the trial, and Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and prosecuted under Article 268 of the Criminal Law. During the court's questioning of the defendants, most of them tried to evade and deny the charges. The judge ruled that the evidence was complete and that there was no room for denial. He immediately sentenced Ye Mingji to one month's imprisonment, the assistants Gu Peigen and others to a fine of eight yuan each, and the gamblers to a fine of four yuan each as a warning. All confiscated items were confiscated as per the list.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Qin Cainan's Residential Mortgage Dispute <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Qin Cainan, a 51-year-old Wuxi native involved in the international drug trafficking case, was arrested by the French police for the drug case and sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. As a result, he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 4,000 yuan. Qin refused to accept the verdict and repeatedly appealed to the High Third Branch Court and the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for retrial. The original sentence of imprisonment and fine was upheld. He is currently appealing to the Supreme Court. During the appeal period, he paid 15,000 yuan in cash as bail. In October 1934, due to litigation, Qin mortgaged his residence at No. 725 Foch Road, French Registration No. 953, land and buildings, to the Siming Savings Association on Nanjing Road for 80,000 yuan, with a one-year redemption period. When the term expired, Qin was unable to redeem the property. On August 15th of this year, the auctioneer, Xie, according to Article 878 of the Civil Code, after negotiating with the debtor, sold the entire mortgaged property at a price of 96,786.50 yuan to the creditor and entered into a contract. Currently, Qin resides in the house and refuses to move out. Therefore, the Siming Savings Association has appointed a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qin Cainan for the delivery of the property, as well as interest calculated at ten yuan per day from August 16th of this year until the date of execution, and to bear the litigation costs. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the parties to the Seventh Civil Court yesterday, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, requesting a judgment on the object of the suit. The defendant's representative, lawyer Sun Zuji, responded by requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim and the request for provisional execution, stating that the defendant's agreement with the plaintiff was entered into out of necessity. At the time of the agreement, both parties agreed to postpone the disposal of the property for six months from the date of the agreement because the defendant's property was worth more than the estimated value. The defendant is currently residing in the property and is seeking a buyer to sell it at a good price in order to repay the plaintiff's debt. There were letters exchanged between the parties after the agreement, which are presented as evidence. The plaintiff's lawyer further stated that although there was a six-month postponement of the disposal, it was not a promise that the defendant could reside in the property but rather a promise that the defendant could find a new buyer within six months. After further arguments by both lawyers, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for 9:00 a.m. on the 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Forged Traffic Banknotes Discovered on the Market: The Names of the Eastern Three Provinces Traffic Banknotes Were Cut Off, and the Names of the Shanghai Banknotes Were Pasted on Seamlessly; The Original Banknotes Were Slightly Burned and Could Still Be Exchanged for New Banknotes <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a type of counterfeit legal tender from the Traffic Bank that had been patched up was discovered on the market. Because the patching technique was quite ingenious, it was difficult to detect the fraud. These patched banknotes were originally issued by banks in the Eastern Three Provinces. Because the banknotes issued by banks in that area were no longer in circulation after the Incident of the Three Eastern Provinces, some criminals took the opportunity to collect these banknotes, cut off the most important parts of the banknotes, such as the drawing in the middle and the name of the issuing bank, and replaced them with the drawing and the name of the Shanghai Traffic Bank. In this way, the useless banknotes from outside the customs became Traffic Bank legal tender. The cut banknotes were then slightly burned around the edges to expose the burnt marks, and then used to exchange for new banknotes at the Traffic Bank as "fire-damaged" banknotes. In short, after this procedure, one Traffic Bank banknote could be used as two, and the worthless banknotes from outside the customs could be used again. Compared to counterfeiting legal tender, this method was not only less costly and more profitable, but also simpler. As a result, patched banknotes appeared frequently on the market, and it was easy to be deceived if one was not careful. The Traffic Bank had also received these counterfeit banknotes and was now paying close attention to them and trying to eradicate them, as they were a menace to the financial community. The day before yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., Chuan Yi, a 36-year-old Cantonese man, together with Yang Yizhong, an apprentice from a money shop at No. 461 Sichuan Road, went to the Traffic Bank and took out eighteen Traffic Bank banknotes, each worth one yuan, with the drawing and the name of the bank in the middle cut off, leaving burnt marks and the numbers on the left and right completely intact, and requested to exchange them for new banknotes. The bank staff carefully inspected each banknote and saw that the damage was similar on each, and that it was not due to fire damage. Suspecting that they were patched banknotes, they instructed the bank's investigator, Hong Yutian, to take Chuan, Yang, and the original banknotes to the general police station. After questioning, it was confirmed that Yang was not involved and was released. Detectives Kang Zengxiang and Sun Jishan escorted Chuan to his residence at No. 16 Yongdeli, Tianjin Road, and searched the premises, finding one ten-yuan banknote that had been completely patched up, and several five-yuan, ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan banknotes with the name of the Guangdong Provincial Bank printed on them, totaling 12,700 yuan, and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Chuan, along with witnesses Yang Yizhong and Hong Yutian, escorted Chuan and the counterfeit banknotes to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Feng Shide conducted the interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the circumstances of the case. Because the case was important and required a detailed investigation, it was requested that the suspect be temporarily detained for investigation. The court then questioned Chuan Yi and ordered him to be detained for further interrogation in seven days.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenhua, a doctor at the Hongkou Women's Hospital at No. 290 Zhaofeng Road, and his concubine Chen Xiaobao were arrested and sent to the First Special Court on September 4 of this year for conspiring to kill a woman named Lu Aili and a man named Yu Gengsheng who had abortions, and burying their bodies underground. The interrogation has been completed and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 20th of this month. However, the police have been strictly investigating Zhang Wenhua's wife, Zhang Yao (39 years old, from Shanghai), and have been unable to arrest her in Pudong, so they requested that the Special Court issue an arrest warrant. The police finally arrested Zhang Yao. However, because she was six months pregnant and about to give birth, she was sent to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital. She gave birth to a daughter a few days ago. The Chinese and Western detectives of the police station have been conducting a detailed investigation into Zhang Yao's criminal involvement for days. The result of the investigation determined that Zhang Yao had no connection to the murder and body burning case. Therefore, Judge Zhong Qing of the First Court presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. When the police handed over the case, the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, immediately stated the previous situation and requested that the arrest warrant be revoked. Judge Zhong ruled that Zhang Yao's arrest warrant should be revoked.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Assassination of a Man on Jiaozhou Road; Police Solve the Case; Victim Shot in Fourteen Places; Gatekeeper Zhang Huaisheng Arrested <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 11th of this month, at approximately 10 p.m., an assassination occurred near Lane 273 of Jiaozhou Road near Yanping Road in West Shanghai.  The Gordon Road police station, upon hearing the alarm, dispatched investigators to investigate. The assailant(s) had already fled.  A man appearing to be 35 or 36 years old was found lying on his back in a pool of blood, covered in bullet wounds. The total number of wounds, large and small, amounted to fourteen.  He was rushed by vehicle to the Red Cross Hospital, but died en route. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination and</p>
<p>orders were given to arrest the perpetrator(s).</p>
<p>It is now known that after this case occurred, the responsible Gordon Road police station specially dispatched Chinese detective Liu Zhengang to conduct a detailed investigation for several days. He discovered that the deceased was named Kang Wenjin, from Anhui, residing at 940 Dongma Li, Binlang Road. Based on various clues, at approximately 6 a.m. the previous morning, Zhang Huaisheng, an Anhui native working as a gatekeeper, suspected of the crime, was arrested at 940 Dongma Li and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court to request his detention.  The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, then presented the case, detailing the</p>
<p>Investigation Process,</p>
<p>stating that on the night of the 11th of this month, at around 10 p.m., Chinese police officer No. 2920 from the Gordon Road police station was patrolling near the scene when suddenly several gunshots were heard at the intersection of Yanping Road and Jiaozhou Road. He rushed to investigate and found a man lying in a pool of blood in Lane 273, with numerous gunshot wounds. He immediately reported to the police station by telephone and ordered an ambulance to take the injured person to the Red Cross Hospital. However, he died en route before treatment could be administered. The body was sent to the coroner's office. An investigation was launched, but because the area was remote, with few people around, and the deceased's clothing was tattered, it was assumed that he was from the criminal underworld, so it was decided that the motive was not robbery for profit but</p>
<p>a premeditated revenge killing.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that the deceased had fourteen bullet wounds of varying sizes on his front and back. Based on this, it was determined that there were at least two assailants at the time, each wielding a handgun, who had engaged in a fierce struggle with the deceased, resulting in his clothes being torn. In addition to several shell casings recovered at the scene, three pieces of paper were found on the deceased: one was a registration form, one was a remittance receipt, and the other was a pawn ticket from the Renhe pawnshop. The police contacted the post office and were informed that a Mr. Kang from 400 Binlang Road had</p>
<p>come to send money.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign detectives immediately went to Binlang Road to investigate, but there was no number 400. Therefore, the address written on the postal form was forged. They then went to Renhe Pawnshop and found that on September 28, a Mr. Kang from 940 Tongmao Li, Binlang Road, had pawned a small leather suitcase for two yuan, one jiao, and five fen. Because the original pawn ticket had been lost, a guarantor was required to issue a replacement, as per the regulations. Therefore, Xu Yongxing Tobacco and Paper Shop at 131 Tongmao Li provided a seal of guarantee. The police retrieved the pawned suitcase and, upon inspection, found</p>
<p>several slips of paper inside.</p>
<p>These were the contact information for a certain police detective captain and a draft by a certain Yin, discussing a dispute over women. They then went to Xu Yongxing Tobacco and Paper Shop to investigate. The shop owners, Xu Jinshan and his wife, Xu, stated that they did not know Kang Wenjin and that Zhang Huaisheng, who worked as a gatekeeper, had introduced them to act as guarantors. Zhang lived at 940 Tongmao Li, and so on. Chinese and foreign detectives secretly investigated the area and found many men and women entering and exiting 940, all of whom were from Anhui. Therefore, yesterday morning, they</p>
<p>detained the men and women</p>
<p>fifteen people in the room. After Mrs. Xu identified one of them as Zhang Huaisheng, Zhang was arrested and the others were released. It was confirmed that Zhang had previously been employed as a gatekeeper by the Hardoon Company, but was dismissed on the 7th of this month after being accused of extortion. The police stated that the investigation procedures were not yet complete, and that the handgun used to kill Kang Wenjin was found to be the same one used in the</p>
<p>robbery and injury</p>
<p>at the Lafayette Theatre on Lafayette Road on April 19 of this year, and in the attempted robbery and shooting at 121 Lime Kiln, Caojiadu. Therefore, they requested permission to detain him. They then presented all the evidence. Zhang Huaisheng denied the accusations, stating that he did not know the deceased or the owner of Xu Yongxing Tobacco and Paper Shop. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confession and ordered Zhang to be detained for seven days for further review.</p>

The minister's secretary discovered that the letter was forged and had Zeng arrested and sent to the General Police Station, and then transferred to the First Special District Court for trial. These details have been reported in this newspaper.

The surcharge percentages vary from railway to railway, resulting in inconsistent total minimum fees. Railway merchants find this inconvenient. Furthermore, goods with surcharges calculated by volume or item as stipulated in the tariff table have been exempt from surcharges. Minimum freight should also be exempt to standardize and facilitate calculation. It is now specially stipulated that regardless of whether the goods are in full carloads or less than full carloads, the minimum freight will be exempt from surcharges, effective November 1 of this year. Clause 2 of the instructions No. 3684, Lianzi, issued by this Ministry on October 16 of last year, regarding the calculation of surcharges, should not apply to minimum freight. Furthermore, the ferry fee for crossing the river in the capital should still be collected separately and is not included in the minimum freight. In addition to separate orders, you are hereby instructed to comply and implement accordingly. The Bureau has instructed the Transportation Department to handle this matter.</p>

<p>Creditors Required to Register by End of Month. Tongyi Bank held a special shareholders' meeting on the 12th of this month and resolved to dissolve and liquidate.

They all agreed that the situation of the times and the market was worse than at the time of the suspension of operations, and there was no hope of resumption.

Yesterday, the coffin was moved to the Yongxi Hall of the Shaoxing Guild Hall, pending the arrival of his elder brother in Shanghai for the funeral.

<h3 id="e187">Letter <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, I read a news item in your newspaper titled "Yichang Enamelware Store Robbed," which was slightly inconsistent with the facts. I hope you will grant a correction to clarify the truth and list the details of my capture of the robber as follows: At 9 p.m. on the 12th of this month, I was on the Route 6 French Concession tram in Laoximen and got off at Xiaqiao, planning to visit relatives in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. Unexpectedly, when I reached the entrance of Huizhong Middle School, I suddenly heard a cry of "Catch the thief!" in front of me. I saw a person wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers running towards me, and the person chasing him kept shouting "Catch the thief!" At that time, I was moved by passion and, regardless of everything, bravely stepped forward to chase the thief. The thief then crossed the French Concession iron gate and fled towards the South Manufacturing Bureau Road. I followed him to the intersection of Manufacturing Bureau Road and Xie Xu Road, about nine feet away from the thief. I jumped up and tackled the thief to the ground, and I also fell on the thief's back. I tightly held the thief's hand, pulled him up, and held on to him. Later, the victim called for the police officer on duty, who arrived. I directed the police officer to hold the thief's upper body (near the arm), and then I seized the handgun. We then captured him. The report in your newspaper said that I and Wang Tongjie, police officer No. 19 of the Tangjiawan Police Station, gave chase, and the thief drew his gun to resist arrest, but the gun jammed and he was captured. It also said that a four-inch white Langlin handgun and six bullets were seized on the spot. This is inconsistent with the facts. The thief's handgun and bullets were all seized by me, and there is evidence to prove it (that is, after the thief was captured, I seized the handgun and immediately walked to the Ximen Sub-bureau to hand over the thief. During the transfer, I used the seized handgun as a protective weapon to guard against the thief's escape. When I arrived at the duty room of the Ximen Sub-bureau, I personally handed the gun over to a clerk named Huang for safekeeping. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the gun was loaded with bullets, so the clerk took it out for detailed inspection. The bullet had been struck by the firing pin, but fortunately the bullet failed to fire, otherwise I would have suffered an unexpected misfortune. However, it can be seen that the thief was ferocious. The above-mentioned situation was also explained in detail by the victim, Ou Fusheng, at the Ximen Sub-bureau. If the handgun had been obtained by the police officer on duty, why was I holding it in my hand all the way to escort the thief? Why did I personally hand over the gun and bullets to the bureau? There is no reason for me to have seized a four-inch white Langlin handgun and bullets on the spot with the police officer on duty. Therefore, I am writing to inform your newspaper of the detailed circumstances, hoping that you will grant a correction to dispel public doubts. This is addressed to the Great Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper. Respectfully submitted by Mo Ruo Min, October 14.</p>

<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>In turmoil, the crowd and vehicles flow on the street. From north to south, these few days have been suddenly tense, suddenly lonely, and then suddenly lively again. Like a festering sore, that unbearable pus bursts out of the suppression and then flows onto the street: first the beautiful cars, heavy carts, then rickshaws, "tiger" carts (two-wheeled carts), and even vehicles on two feet; first the beautiful suits, long gowns, and qipaos for autumn, then short jackets and shorts, and among these adults are ignorant children, and even some carrying infants in their arms.</p>
<p>The air is like lead, and what cannot be spread is the depression in people's hearts; it is also like flying poplar catkins, scattered everywhere in the wind and rain. Rumors have taken flight, flying everywhere; with the facts before them, the enemy's weapons shake the courage of the bereaved.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where there is a safe home now; home is under other people's eaves. Frightened souls cannot withstand the devastation of much wind and rain, where is the soul of the nation?</p>
<p>Poor, helpless, weak people, where are you going?</p>
<p>Walking through the crowded streets, watching the tides of people flow. On the sidewalks, and even at the intersecting street corners, what are groups of rolling eyes looking at? Cars, non-stop cars; people, endless people. On the roads in the countryside, people will suspect that a disaster has occurred in the countryside, that floods have occurred somewhere, or that the sun has dried up the entire village? The refugees, in the cities, form rows, without flags, without new or old music, just rows of cars, rows of people: all the means of transportation of several centuries, from cars to a single carrying pole; all the clothing of several centuries, from the new style of 1937 to mud-covered trousers.</p>
<p>What else is there to say? You see there is a chamber pot, a straw mat, or a tattered suitcase... Chairs, screens, all kinds of furniture are complete. And the people? An old woman is holding her little grandson, and a villager is sitting on a "tiger" cart. Workers and farmers are walking on foot. It is happiness to have a car to sit in.</p>
<p>"Mom, I want to sit in that car." A child is crying.</p>
<p>The woman's brow is furrowed.</p>
<p>"What car?"</p>
<p>The child's finger points to a beautiful car that suddenly slides past them with a growl.</p>
<p>The policeman's hand grabs a cushion.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller pleads:</p>
<p>"Thank you!"...</p>
<p>A stick comes down.</p>
<p>"Get out of here, get out of here. Run, run. Go to the countryside to escape!"</p>
<p>"Tch!" A voice laughs from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Hit them! Let them hit them! They should be hit!" The voice of the entire city and village.</p>
<p>Listen! How mixed the sound of the city is!</p>
<p>"Whoosh..."</p>
<p>"Squeak..."</p>
<p>"Tuk-tuk..."</p>
<p>……</p>

<p>— Chuyang</p>
<p>Lately, every time evening approaches, a sense of vague agitation arises within me, much like the autumn willows in the private garden outside the window, swaying in the evening breeze.</p>
<p>——Is it autumn melancholy? The sorrow of a fallen nation? Or the troubles of life, the weariness brought on by illness?</p>
<p>I myself am at a loss for an answer, only feeling uneasy staying inside, flipping through a newspaper aimlessly. A copy of "Pastoral Symphony" that I was just reading on the desk is blown shut by the wind, and I think of Gide's line: "How happy those without eyes must be!" My heart sinks even further...</p>
<p>This small attic room is so cramped that apart from a bed, a table, and a chair, there's no room to move. If I want to rest, the only option is to lie down on the bed. On the bed is a letter I received this afternoon. A friend studying at a university in Jiangwan wrote at the end of his letter: "The unsettling situation from this time last year has reappeared before my eyes. People are moving away in an endless stream, and we are startled multiple times a night, making it hard to feel at peace. I can't help but envy the tranquility you and others enjoy."</p>
<p>——Ah, who can still be at peace?</p>
<p>Anyone with Chinese blood cannot be at peace!</p>
<p>Not being able to be at peace doesn't mean one can simply sulk in an attic room. Intellectuals are forever neurotic sentimentalists, their bodies and minds in a state of weak contradiction. ——Again, I scold myself like this.</p>
<p>I jump up and look at the sky. It's not devoid of clouds, and the setting sun is casting a few golden rays, mixed with a layer of smog. The sky in this city is always more depressing than bright. A loud thud from below startles me. It turns out it's the young couple living downstairs pushing their beautiful baby carriage out for a walk. Watching their slender and petite figures slowly walk towards the entrance of the alley, I can't help but feel my own loneliness. I originally wanted to go for a walk too, but the thought of aimlessly wandering around alone in the cool air is unappealing, so I hesitate again. The illusion of a home floats into my mind: Could it be that I am also longing for a partner, a home?</p>
<p>Home prospers the nation, women and life... life is spent amidst the troubles of these desires and wills. I hope there will be a bright tomorrow, but today's twilight feels like an endless twilight!</p>
<h3 id="e191">China Through the Eyes of a "Sinologist" <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>After cutting open the belly to inspect, there isn't a drop of ink inside, yet those who demand a stomach full of well-reasoned strategies are still us, the literary hacks who piece together words like Tangrams. The donkey turns the millstone, turning and turning, still getting nowhere. But the donkey is forgivable. Its turning of the millstone is not voluntary but forced. On the donkey, we can see the yoke on its shoulders, the "blinders" over its eyes. Behind it, we can also hear the driver's shouts of "Giddy up!" or the whip's threatening "crack." The donkey is pitiful, we can't help but think. But when it is unharnessed, given some fodder, or the master shows favor by adding some extra beans and wheat, or gently pats its back, the donkey feels infinitely honored, and it "bellows" a few times, pleased with itself. To the master, this is a tactic, but to the donkey, it merely reveals its clumsy pitiableness.</p>
<p>The donkey turning the millstone is an age-old matter; however, to lead out the donkey and make a show of force is as ridiculous as leading a dog to plow the field. Therefore, when a pack of wolves comes before us, instead of drawing bows and setting arrows, we use the donkey, just unharnessed from the millstone, to "bellow loudly" in an attempt to scare them away. This is simply a trick as clumsy as the donkey itself.</p>
<p>Although there may be donkeys that can act "foolishly clever" and put on tiger skin, the piercing of the tiger skin is only a matter of time. Of course, as far as the donkey is concerned, it sees itself as a behemoth, but "his skill stops there," as someone has already said. But besides this skill, what else is there to do?</p>
<p>The donkey itself imagines that it is full of abilities, just as we imagine that we have a thousand hands and feet, and we imagine that we have many glorious titles. But someone has already told me that the "crown" that was never crowned has been placed in the corner of the toilet, and the hat we wear on our heads is made of paper, similar to the pointed paper hat that people put on us when we are paraded through the streets for public indignation. If we know this, the best way is not to be nosy, just as donkeys don't have to be nosy and bellow. So, in extraordinary times, we who are completely useless, even if we are useful, can at most help the scene and join the fun. That's all. Otherwise, even if there is a brilliant opinion, it can be told to the heart. Going to draft a ten-thousand-word policy proposal, one must feel that where does one begin? It's impossible, and yet stubbornly wants to say it, and there is a way. That is to copy "clichés." But if you copy the Chinese, you have to guard against people giving you the title of "plagiarist." The best way, then, is to copy foreigners.</p>
<p>Here I am copying foreigners' articles. (Because the technology is not advanced, I can't even copy completely, I naturally can't manage much.)</p>
<p>I once read Ms. Pearl Buck's great essay, "China Against Japan," in this year's American magazine Asia, who is known as a Chinese expert. After reading such a mysterious judgment, I felt unhappy, first because she extremely praised Japan. Here I have to declare that my unhappiness is not because she praises Japan. If I am unhappy because of praising Japan, some people may say that I have been poisoned by narrow nationalism. But I believe I am not a blind nationalist. The reason why I oppose her argument is because, like other imperialist scholars, she regards imperialist aggression as a mission for an excellent nation to civilize a backward nation. She believes that Japan's seizure of China is materially beneficial to China, roads will be built, commerce will be developed, disasters will be prevented, politics will be put on track, bandits will disappear, factories will be added, and the railway network will run through the entire country. It is so in material terms, and in terms of spiritual construction, illiteracy will decrease day by day, and the hygiene situation will be greatly improved. China's trachoma, lung disease, malaria, and hookworms will be greatly reduced. "No one can deny these facts." I really suspect that such words came from the mouth of the "Wangdao Paradise" propagator, and I don't believe that they came from the mouth of an American woman who had a relationship with China but had nothing to do with Japan. I don't know what she is based on to do the duty of propaganda for imperialism. This is one point that I oppose in her brilliant opinion.</p>
<p>The second point is that she is a believer in weapons alone. She says that China cannot resist Japan in the war because China has no equipment to speak of except for a large number of untrained people who can be used as cannon fodder. It really treats Chinese people as worse than the Indian tribes in her noble country. We know that since the founding of the United States, although those Indians have been "tamed" and their land has been gradually plundered. And drive them to the so-called reserved area. Such work took centuries to complete. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, Indian resistance was still heard from time to time. In the middle, the US government had suffered several defeats. I don't believe that a great nation of 400 million people can be easily used as cannon fodder, as she said. The origin of this impression may be because the Chinese themselves are too dragging in some places. The three northeastern provinces and Rehe were occupied without resistance, and the troops of Ji Province withdrew after being frightened by people. Those foreigners who call themselves Chinese experts but actually know nothing will naturally feel that the Chinese can only be used as cannon fodder and have no other use.</p>
<p>Third, what I object to is that she simply regards the Chinese as "precious goods" who cherish their lives and are selfish and self-interested. Naturally, it cannot be said that there are no such people among the Chinese, but she puts the stigma of humiliation on the head of the Chinese nation, but we dare not accept it. Although she did not have the malicious intentions of the neighboring Japanese officer Takashi Matsushita, who she admired, who said that the "vast majority of Chinese officials and people are mostly confused by profit and ignore the country, and even willingly harm the country. Their purpose is only to solve the desires of one's own official group, and they don't care about the country or the people's livelihood", she committed the same superficial mistake. She said, "On a personal level, the Chinese are adaptable, and if they don't have great enjoyment, even ordinary small pleasures are willing to accept. At the same time, failure is not a shame for them, and success is not a joy. They only give up dying when they cannot survive to the last limit, and regard life as more precious than honor, ambition, and patriotism.</p>
<p>Are all Chinese people as she said? I don't want to go to the long history of China to prove it with people, because those people already belong to the past. And the people who are alive and live among us, I can find many classes and types of people to prove that not all Chinese people can be classified into this category.</p>
<p>I always feel that those so-called "experts" are like many so-called experts in academics who only have a smattering of knowledge. They first establish a big premise, and simplify all the phenomena in the universe and include them in front of that big premise. They don't ask whether that big premise itself is accurate, and they also don't ask whether all phenomena can be included in that big premise to draw a conclusion. Their only goal is to grasp that big premise that they think they are right, and quickly find a conclusion. Being able to get a conclusion, regardless of whether the conclusion is true, their goal has been achieved, and they can ignore everything else. Therefore, those foreign "China Experts" only need to have been to Shanghai once, or ran a few miles from Shanghai, or read a few Chinese books, or met a few Chinese people, or saw a few Chinese things, and they think they already know China and the Chinese. So, after talking with these few Chinese people, or picking up a few things they have seen and heard, they say "that is China," or say "this is the Chinese." Furthermore, from these few things and these few people, they infer: "This is the fate of China." As a result, the Chinese in One Thousand and One Nights appear in front of foreigners, the Chinese cultural relics in the Ancient Palace Museum appear in front of foreigners, and the characteristics of the Chinese in the Four Books and Five Classics, Lao Zhuang philosophy appear in front of foreigners. And those so-called high-class Chinese who are educated in foreign countries and live in Chinese concessions, also cater to the foreigners' preferences and deliberately abstractly fabricate many mysterious things in order to deceive foreigners and arouse their curiosity, turning China into an inexplicable country. Those credulous foreigners believe that it is true, so they say that a certain Chinese celebrity said that China is like this, so it can be seen that China is like this.</p>
<p>Sophistry itself is not a sin, but sophistry with ulterior motives is a sin. Distorted sophistry caused unintentionally is forgivable, but sophistry caused intentionally is unforgivable. Of course, around us, there are many skins that have not yet reached the vertebrate stage, but there are also many solid and upright men standing in front of us. It is one kind of people who rushed into the school with wooden sticks and bare hands to insist on confronting the police in Beijing for several hours without retreating. It is another kind of people in Tianjin who resolutely risked their lives to fight if they were unwilling to be traitors. It is another kind of people who firmly resisted the banner in the Northeast. It is another kind of people who silently waited for the signal of national liberation in the vast wilderness of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The poet Carl Sandburg's prophecy may soon sweep over us:</p>
<p>The booming passion of hundreds of millions of people can rise up</p>
<p>to become a whirlwind; once a gust is launched, who can drive it? you? Or you? Or you? Only history, only tomorrow knows</p>
<p>Because every change bursts out like</p>
<p>A baby born of its own turbulent time</p>
<p>Extract a pattern that was not known before.</p>
<p>These many intrinsic characteristics brewed in China will naturally not be heard, seen, or tasted by our famous "China Expert," but time will always reveal the outer cover and push these brand-new facts to stimulate her eyes, the vibration of her ears, and the touch of her heart, and make her understand that "that is just China". "That is just the Chinese public."</p>

<p>— Xingjian</p>
<p>I stand before a solitary grave,</p>
<p>Caressing the worn and damaged inscription, unable to read the name of the one who sleeps eternally.</p>
<p>Clumps of weeds cover this uneven mound of earth,</p>
<p>Knowing that no one has cared for this deceased traveler for a long time!</p>
<p>This place is a desolate wilderness beyond a lonely village,</p>
<p>Even if there are still signs of habitation, they are still far away;</p>
<p>Except for woodcutters and shepherds occasionally passing by here,</p>
<p>All there is is the uncaring clouds drifting leisurely,</p>
<p>Wild rabbits coming and going at will.</p>
<p>This scene fills me with melancholy and hesitation,</p>
<p>Arousing from the depths of my heart my aversion to death.</p>
<p>I do not know what kind of person this silent departed one was,</p>
<p>But today I offer my utmost sympathetic mourning.</p>
<p>You must have had a glorious history worthy of song and tears,</p>
<p>Yet in the annals of God's chosen people,</p>
<p>Not a single word or sentence can be found about you!</p>
<p>Born with the grasses and trees, dead and rotting with the grasses and trees,</p>
<p>Leaving no trace of you in this desolate world for people to remember.</p>
<p>Was it the difficult days of hardship and adversity that made you panic,</p>
<p>Eagerly longing to come here to hide?</p>
<p>Was it the nagging illness that robbed you of your happy days,</p>
<p>Therefore, you silently nodded, agreeing to tranquil death?</p>
<p>Was it the cruel world giving you unbearable humiliation everywhere,</p>
<p>Filling you with anger, and interrupting the extension of your life?</p>
<p>Or did the bitter cup of love cool your burning heart,</p>
<p>Seeking extraordinary comfort, and willingly departing alone in desolation,</p>
<p>Walking listlessly and coldly?</p>

<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Suddenly, a letter from Xia, from a foreign country, arrived from Huang.</p>
<p>Four years, what a long four years!</p>
<p>I don't know anything about Xia's news, and Xia doesn't know my whereabouts either?</p>
<p>Yes, we have been out of touch for four years.</p>
<p>In short, since the outbreak of the "September 18th" and "January 28th" wars, the relationship of love between us has been broken, destroyed by artillery fire. The ruthless artillery fire has shattered, crushed, and eliminated all our fantasies at that time.</p>
<p>From that period on, our thoughts and feelings also underwent great changes along with the environment at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, we each had our own opinions. And our understanding of life was different, and our views were different, so we finally couldn't integrate.</p>
<p>Xia was very selfish for the sake of love, and she thought about everything from her own point of view. As for me, it is better to say that I was for the sake of ideals than for the sake of love, so it was often difficult to approach Xia's individualistic views.</p>
<p>However, Xia's personality was very stubborn. She wanted to drag me from my complicated life into her simple and gentle rosy life.</p>
<p>How is this possible! For the sake of love, can I sell my personality, soul and glorious ideals? If this is really necessary, then I have to sacrifice "love".</p>
<p>"Love," I think: should be the driving force of life. "Love" is a kind of cohesive force of mankind. This kind of cohesion, it is not for its own happiness. "Love," the force of evidence, is a force that destroys evil and darkness, and creates a great and bright life!</p>
<p>Therefore, I felt that Xia's love for me was dim, gray, weak, and meaningless. So the love between us finally broke and disappeared.</p>
<p>That's how our lives were separated in the fierce bloody battle. Xia, so went away sadly. Xia, then sadly and angrily returned to her distant foreign home that was trampled under the enemy. From then on, goodbye forever, Xia who once loved me passionately!</p>
<p>At that time, in the moment of parting, although my heart felt extremely painful. I believe that from now on, Xia and I will never meet again.</p>
<p>This matter, it is better to say that we are disappointed than disappointed in love. It is better to say that it is a failure than a success. Because - we are all separated, broken up, and fighting for our own future.</p>
<p>In short, from the year of the war, Xia's impression was no longer engraved in my mind, and my shadow naturally would not exist in Xia's heart. The realistic and cruel war has differentiated our lives. From then on, four years, I no longer know Xia's news. Anyway, Xia doesn't need to know me either.</p>
<p>Yes, four years, what a long time. I live alone. But collective struggle and work make me strong and happy. I don't feel the sadness of loneliness, and I won't be distressed because of this seeking love.</p>
<p>Isn't the great and infinite love of the world more glorious and happier than that person's insignificant "love"?</p>
<p>Four years, what a long time. But I am still living the same way. Constantly moving towards the dangerous path of life. Although during this time, I have suffered many setbacks and hit many nails. However, my heart has not died, and my heart is still burning with the flames of struggle.</p>
<p>But, Xia, how is she now? Now, although I received this sudden coming letter from Xia. However, Xia didn't tell me anything. However, in this simple letter from Xia, I have already tasted the sadness of the body. Although she did not express it clearly, I have already seen the traces of tears in the words between the lines of this pair of letters. Could it be that she is already disgusted with her current luxurious, decadent, degenerate and boring life as a wife? Have you already awakened?</p>
<p>Four years, what a long time. The paths we take are completely opposite, and they are getting farther and farther apart. We have become strangers on the journey, and even we have become irreconcilable enemies.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to answer to Xia, to let her understand, is that me——</p>
<p>"This person, Zeng Ye, loves your Lin, he has never changed his position and has never shaken his faith. He is still the same as in the past - standing on the battle line of fighting for national liberation and freedom, and fighting until the last breath!"</p>

<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>Ah! How fast ten years have passed! In this city, I quickly grew from a child into an "adult." The memories of childhood are mostly accurate. I remember how this city grew from decay and ruins. I almost saw with one glance how it slowly prospered from a state of decline and desolation. New-style buildings gradually increased, the roads were widened, and even the empty new and old city avenues were lined with many new-style factories and houses. The electric lights shone brightly, and in this prairie, the big city at dusk, the neon lights and the rattling broadcast radios flickered in the streets of the frontier at night. People's lives are also slowly changing, but the recession still deeply shrouds the city. The market for human flesh is "expanding" day by day. The lives of those small citizens who grew up with this city cannot be discussed except for corruption.</p>
<p>After seeing this, I, a young man, saw another scene. This time, the entire frontier prairie and city were about to be transformed into a "Paradise of the Kingly Way," right?</p>
<p>The planes with red ball tails also gave the people on the prairie more knowledge, and they got used to seeing them. As usual, there are always one or two circling in the blue sky every day. Breaking through the clear air, the buzzing sound it makes disturbs everyone's sense of hearing. From this sense of hearing and sight, people also heard their own "fate," but they didn't know when people would lay eggs, and they were always grumbling in their hearts: "Will they lay eggs?"</p>
<p>What followed was a white flag with a fluttering red ball, as if it wanted to pierce the heart of every young person. Below it was a vast courtyard called a public hall. Who knows what tricks are being played inside! "Matsuda Public Hall" and "×× Public Hall" also appear everywhere in the streets and alleys. When did this place become "someone else's" residential area?</p>
<p>The frontier prairie and this big city in the desert are gradually changing. It will change so much that I will not recognize its original appearance, right? And now, I am about to leave it, this city where I was born, raised, and lived for more than ten years!</p>
<p>Recalling the things I used to hear and see without feeling anything: the white snow on the top of Daqingshan in winter, the strings of winter bells ringing past, the flocks of sheep grazing on the green grassland, and the crows wailing in the sky at dusk... At this time, everything is unusually kind to me, and I feel attached to it.</p>
<p>My friends in the frontier, I wish you in advance when we meet again: "Have you been well since we last met!"</p>
<p>Will this not become an illusory dream?</p>
<p>This time, I really and truly felt the pain of "parting feelings" (End)</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Significance of Sending Telegrams to Celebrate a Birthday <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>According to newspapers, the birthday of Executive Yuan President Chiang Kai-shek is October 29th of the Gregorian calendar. This year marks his 50th birthday. The President advocates a frugality campaign, so this event should not be extravagant. Officials of various agencies will only send letters or telegrams of congratulations on that day and will not send gifts, it is said. President Chiang has a firm foundation and embraces humility. He is a shining example, and those who hear of it can agree with it.</p>
<p>President Chiang is the leader of the Party and the country, and his hard work is highly meritorious. The people of the whole country have long wanted to purchase airplanes to celebrate his birthday while warmly supporting him. This matter is related to national defense and should be discussed separately. As for giving gifts, since an instruction to stop has been issued, it should be followed. However, if officials of various agencies and the people of the whole country only send letters or telegrams of congratulations on that day, given the vastness of our country's territory and the time required for postal delivery, there is a risk that the time will be insufficient or overdue. The only way to remedy this is to send social telegrams.</p>
<p>The use of social telegrams is not limited to one purpose, but its significance is actually imitating the international practice of sending congratulatory telegrams. Looking at the people of Europe and America, whenever the birthday of the head of state is celebrated, they all send congratulatory telegrams to express their congratulations. On that day, the telegraph bureau works overtime and is busy. Congratulatory telegrams from all directions fly in like snowflakes, and the enthusiastic atmosphere is enough to see one aspect. The Ministry of Transportation initiated social telegrams and set the price at a particularly low level to facilitate public communication. It is the most appropriate celebration method.</p>
<p>Moreover, President Chiang's service to the country is far above that of the heads of state of other countries. All of our people should send a social congratulatory telegram on that day, regardless of distance, whether individual or group, to express their sincerity in support, to promote the way of frugality, and to be economical in time, simple in procedures, solemn in meaning, and novel in method. All telegraph offices in the country can send telegrams. Patriotic people will surely be happy to adopt it.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Necessary Conditions for Success of International Traders <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Ming</p>
<p>To compete in the ever-changing international business arena and to stand out, one must possess exceptional vision, unwavering determination, and skillful maneuvering. However, "being well-informed" is ultimately a key element for success. Matters such as market price fluctuations, source conditions, sluggish or booming sales, etc., must be known quickly and thoroughly. Only then can strategies be decided and opportunities be seized promptly. Otherwise, even a slight delay will allow others to get ahead. Therefore, the speed of information can determine success or failure in the business world. To be well-informed, the effective use of communication tools is crucial—that is, after obtaining commercial information, using the fastest communication methods to transmit it. Currently, the fastest international communication method is the "telegram." However, there are many telegraph circuits with varying speeds. Therefore, when using telegrams for communication, one must also understand how to choose the right circuit. The fastest and best telegraph circuit from China to the rest of the world right now is the "International Wireless Circuit"—"fast" is the objective for selecting a circuit, and "good" includes attentive service and providing various conveniences to the public.</p>
<p>Why is the International Wireless Telegraph the fastest and most advantageous? Because it communicates directly with major cities in various countries, using the latest high-speed equipment, making it incomparably "fast." Furthermore, constant attention is paid to improving internal operations. Two points are particularly noteworthy: (1) Strict Proofreading—the accuracy of the telegram text is of utmost importance. Therefore, the international radio station has specially assigned trained personnel to handle proofreading. Each telegram is proofread immediately after receipt or transmission. If there are any errors, they are notified and corrected immediately without waiting for the recipient to inquire. This is of great benefit to both senders and receivers because waiting for the sender or receiver to discover the error and then inquire would inevitably cause delays. As a result of implementing this, telegrams are extremely accurate and error-free. (2) Increasing Retransmission Speed—the Shanghai Telegraph Office originally had a dedicated line for the international radio station to relay telegrams from various domestic locations to foreign countries. Later, to further increase speed, multiple multiplex machines were installed, enabling international telegrams from major bureaus to be transmitted directly to the international radio station. Since the implementation of this measure, the speed of telegram transmission has increased significantly! In addition, measures such as restricting the delivery time of messengers and implementing telephone transmission of telegrams are all related to increasing telegram speed.</p>
<p>Therefore, for commercial firms engaged in international trade, if they send international telegrams, they only need to specify "via wireless" or "Via Cgra" to receive complete satisfaction. Those commercial firms that have already adopted international wireless telegrams have practically experienced various conveniences and will undoubtedly believe my words are true. Those commercial firms that have not yet adopted international wireless telegrams, but definitely hope for swift telegram transmission, may well experiment to see if what I say is true. Moreover, international wireless is a newly established state-owned enterprise in our country. All our citizens should support and adopt it to further its development, especially since the rewards it offers are exceptionally swift and include attentive service and various conveniences.</p>
<p>We know that the more developed the communication industry, the more communication efficiency can be improved; the more convenient communication methods become, the more they can promote the prosperity of international trade. Therefore, international traders, for the sake of their businesses and for the sake of patriotism, cannot but think big and unanimously support this emerging state-owned enterprise, cooperating closely with the telegraph bureau to jointly promote the economic revival of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Issues Regarding International Telegram Rates <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>The formulation of international telegram rates is quite complex. International telegram rates vary among countries, with significant discrepancies. Some distances are the same but prices differ greatly; some gold franc prices are similar, but the values of various countries' conversions to their own currencies vary widely. It is difficult to generalize. The current international telegram rates in our country are not entirely based on distance, but distance remains an important factor in determining international telegram rates.</p>
<p>Due to historical reasons, various countries calculate international telegram distances based on the length of the wire route, not the spatial distance. For example, the telegraph line from our country to the United States passes through the Philippines or Japan, so the price between China and the United States should be higher than the price between the Philippines and the United States or between Japan and the United States. This time, organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce compared the spatial distance and price from Little Luzon to the United States, and from Japan to the United States, with the spatial distance and price from China to the United States, and hastily concluded that the price between China and the United States was higher. This is actually due to a lack of understanding of the aforementioned principle. Furthermore, Little Luzon is only a port in the Philippine Islands, and Japan is only one of the many countries in the Far East. If one wants to compare the telegram price from China to the United States with those from other countries to the United States, it seems appropriate to compare the prices from various important countries in the Far East to the United States in order to understand the whole picture. A table is listed below for comparison:</p>
<p>Origin-Destination　Longitude　Price in Gold Francs　Comparison with China-US Price</p>
<p>China——San Francisco　3.75</p>
<p>Hong Kong——San Francisco (British territory)　3.75　Equal</p>
<p>Macau——San Francisco (Portuguese territory)　4.15　Higher by 0.40</p>
<p>Vietnam——San Francisco　3.99　Higher by 0.24</p>
<p>Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements——San Francisco　4.35　Higher by 0.60</p>
<p>——San Francisco　3.75　Equal</p>
<p>East Indies——San Francisco　4.35　Higher by 0.60</p>
<p>India——San Francisco　3.25　Lower by 0.50</p>
<p>Japan——San Francisco　3.05　Lower by 0.70</p>
<p>Philippines——San Francisco</p>
<p>From Little Luzon　2.65　Lower by 1.10</p>
<p>From Luzon Island　2.90　Lower by 0.85</p>
<p>From other islands　3.55　Lower by 0.20</p>
<p>(Note: The basic price for telegrams sent from various countries to China is based on those sent to Shanghai. Those sent to other locations outside Shanghai require additional inland fees. The basic price for telegrams sent from various countries to the United States is based on those sent to San Francisco. Other locations outside San Francisco also require additional line fees. Therefore, the above table uses telegrams sent to San Francisco as the standard.)</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the prices of telegrams from various countries in the Far East to the United States are sometimes equal to those from China to the United States, sometimes higher than those from China, and sometimes lower than those from China. The telegram price between China and the United States cannot be said to be uniquely expensive. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications of our country has signed service contracts with the American Wireless Transportation Company, Great Eastern, Great Northern, and other telegraph companies regarding matters such as telegram transmission and fee collection, which are to be jointly observed. Although any party can propose discussions regarding increases or decreases in telegram prices, the other party's agreement will still depend on whether the reasons are sufficient and whether the facts require detailed consideration and negotiation to decide.</p>
<p>The so-called attempt by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Sino-American Trade Association, and other four organizations to send a telegram of one hundred words from Shanghai to San Francisco, and then have the original telegram sent back from San Francisco to Shanghai, during which the Shanghai side must pay more than one hundred and ten yuan in Chinese currency, indicating that our country's international telegram exchange rate is also more expensive, is actually not entirely true. The price in gold francs for telegrams between China and the United States is originally equal on both sides. The above difference is actually due to the special monetary policy adopted by the United States. Therefore, the power to adjust the above difference rests with the United States and not with our country. According to the current situation, the lower the value of the US dollar or the higher the world silver price, the greater the difference between the amount of national currency paid in China and the equivalent amount of national currency paid in the United States for telegrams between China and the United States. Now that the Yellow Kingdom has adopted a special monetary policy and also holds the authority to manipulate world silver prices, future trends may increase the above difference. For example, according to the current legal exchange rate in our country, if our country wants to equalize the national currency values of the China-US prices, it must reduce the current gold franc conversion rate by about 41% (i.e., each gold franc equals 67 cents). However, the US Silver Purchase Act stipulates that the silver price may be raised to one dollar and twenty-nine cents (USD) per ounce (currently only worth about 45 cents). If this matter is realized and our country's legal exchange rate can still remain unchanged, then our country's gold franc conversion rate must be reduced by 79% of the current rate (each gold franc equals 23.5 cents) to equalize the national currency values of the China-US prices. If the United States further devalues ​​its currency in the future, then our country's gold franc conversion rate must be reduced again. Would this not make our country's gold franc conversion rate not based on China's legal exchange rate, but instead shift with the monetary policy of the United States? In short, the current gold franc conversion rate in the United States is not equal to the true value of the gold franc; this is what is meant by special monetary policy. If this special monetary policy is not changed, it is feared that all telegrams between the world's countries and the United States will not take into account fees, so the national currency price rate converted from the set gold franc cannot only be applied to telegrams sent to a certain country or a certain circuit. If our country reduces the gold franc conversion rate, then the national currency prices for telegrams sent to all countries in the world must be reduced across the board. However, our country's payment to various foreign telegraph companies (wireless or submarine) for fees, due to the restrictions of the International Telegraph Convention and the service contracts signed between our country and various countries, must still be calculated at the full value of the gold franc. If this is done, our country's telecommunications economics will suffer significant losses, which is hardly permissible with current financial resources.</p>
<p>The more developed international trade is, the more international telegrams there will be; this is a certain principle. At the same time, international telegrams are a necessary communication tool for conducting international trade. Therefore, although reducing telegram prices can promote international trade, it is difficult to determine this strength. Let me explain as follows: If international trade between China and the United States increases by 50%, then telegram business may increase by 50%. If the price between China and the United States is reduced by 50%, then between China and the United States...</p>
<p>Although our country's telegram service is a state-owned enterprise, it has no state treasury subsidy, so it must take into account the balance of income and expenditure in terms of economics. Assuming that after the price between China and the United States is reduced by 50%, trade between China and the United States can also increase by 50%, thus increasing the return telegram business between China and the United States by 50%. Although the price is reduced, the telegram fee income may not be reduced too much as a result of business development. However, since the effect of reducing international telegram prices on promoting international trade is difficult to determine, it is impossible to be sure how much telegram business can increase. Our country's international telegram fee income will inevitably be greatly reduced, not only increasing the difficulty of our country's telecommunications economics, but also being difficult for various foreign submarine cable telegraph and wireless telegraph companies to agree to.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, our country's current gold franc conversion rate is close to the gold franc exchange rate, so there is no need to change it easily at the moment, and the international telegram price is also difficult to reduce suddenly. The reason is very clear and should be understood by all sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e202">The Anti-Gonorrhea Movement in Two Rival Countries <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Dr. Hunlen Deke, translated by Dr. Chen Minbo, graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>...The Soviet government agencies designated over 7,000 experts to be responsible...More than 200 health bureaus in Germany promoted new methods for treating gonorrhea</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, which champions socialism globally, and Germany, which is accelerating its militarism, form two extremes of opposition in the international arena. However, despite being rivals, they often take similar and consistent actions.</p>
<p>For example, recently, the Soviet Union established the highest government agency, employing 100,000 scientific specialists to further reform the social environment. Among them were over 7,000 medical experts, all highly educated and renowned figures in medicine, most of whom were professors in various departments of medical universities, specifically responsible for anti-gonorrhea work.</p>
<p>In the past, the Soviet Union used the means of class dictatorship to eliminate gonorrhea, and any men and women suffering from gonorrhea were subjected to castration and confinement to prevent them from having sexual intercourse. Now, based on the research of these experts, the rational protein therapy of "Clinon" is taken internally, reducing 300,000 patients between 1934 and 1935.</p>
<p>To eradicate rampant gonorrhea, Hitler of Germany specifically established 200 health bureaus, forcibly surgically removing the function of gonorrhea patients to prevent mutual infection. However, after Dr. Peter's "Clinon" was nationally recognized, because patients experienced real effects after taking it, this surgery was stopped. More than 200 health bureaus have transformed into agencies promoting "Clinon." However, women with leukorrhea should also use "Karsol Sedative" externally!</p>

<p>The unique substance contained in the testicles can inspire life; loss of semen will inevitably destroy the functions of meridians and muscles.</p>
<p>Wow! Semen is not only the source of reproduction but also contains a powerful substance that can inspire the function of muscles and the nervous system throughout the body. The great French medical scientist, Mr. Broussais, extracted juice called Spermine from the testicles of young animals, and when injected into the human body, he felt his strength flourish, his vitality increase, and his nutrition improve. This proves that human semen also contains such ingredients. If you refer to the excessive semen loss of masturbators, you will see a sallow complexion, thin muscles, fatigue, and lack of energy, poor development, and short sexual organs; coupled with the torment of nocturnal emission, even if life can be prolonged, it is impossible to marry, because premature ejaculation and atrophy after marriage are too painful. Here, it is evident that Spermine is important to the nervous system and muscles.</p>
<p>Spanish venereal disease expert Lumber confirmed that "Neris Nocturnal Emission Tablets" are the most effective medicine for treating nocturnal emission and masturbation because they uniquely contain Spermine. Therefore, it is most effective for treating weakened sexual functions due to nocturnal emission. As for neurasthenia, atrophy, and premature ejaculation, "Butikang" should be taken concurrently.</p>

<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>It is the savior for those with bad breath and dry tongue; those with frequent farts and constipation should pay attention.</p>
<p>People's stomachs and intestines are the organs that hold all kinds of food, working hard all day long with little rest, so they are also most prone to problems.</p>
<p>These problems are often not obvious at first, often presenting as reduced appetite or fear of eating. However, most of them turn into indigestion, with a heavy feeling in the stomach, burning pain in the chest, and distending pain after eating. Some even become severe stomach pain, often causing unconsciousness. Of course, stomach pain cannot be effectively treated with some anesthetic stomach medicines on the market. According to the experiment by Havelock of Germany, taking "Strong Stomach Essence" is the first choice.</p>
<p>However, in one aspect of gastrointestinal disorders, there is no stomach pain, but vomiting, nausea, belching, and acid regurgitation occur, which is extremely painful! The benefit of German "Strong Stomach Essence" lies in its ability to eliminate these complex symptoms. Moreover, the characteristic of this medicine is that it can eliminate bad breath and excessive saliva. It is also good at treating constipation and frequent farts. And because it contains vitamin B, it is especially good at treating beriberi.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Drug Experiment</p>
<h3 id="e205">Gonorrhea Treatment that Stands Alone in the Medical Field <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Saloniki of Chile, translated by Dr. Yang Daonan, who studied in Russia</p>
<p>...Breaking away from previous illusory and empty theories,...Returning to practical effectiveness.</p>
<p>Medicine is a practical science, not engaged in obscure language, especially gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is a disease that changes ten thousand times in an instant. It cannot be discussed empty-headedly on paper. Although many medical experts have studied the problem of gonorrhea, there are few actually effective treatments. However, science is never afraid of difficult mysteries. Since Peter of Germany invented the medicine "Clinon", this invention is as commendable as Ehrlich's invention of "606". Originally, "Clinon" is a mixed preparation of pure yellow pigment and protein. Its effect is that after taking "Clinon", the entire cell activates the gonorrhea resistance general mobilization, surrounding all the gonorrhea in four directions and exterminating them. The other healthy parts are absolutely not damaged. This is really a practical treatment and also a place that leucorrhea drugs cannot reach.</p>
<p>The famous Australian venereologist, Si Shen, said: I once used "Clinon" to cure a young nobleman of about 25 or 26 years old, who had suffered from gonococcal prostatitis for nearly five years and still had not been cured. Later, after my treatment, using "Clinon" as an internal medicine, it had great effect. All difficulties in urination and pain in the urethra were completely cured. Furthermore, after using stimulation and blood tests, it was proved to be a complete cure. For a time, it caused a sensation in the entire medical field. (Translator's note: I learned of this incident in Chita on my way back to China after graduating from the Faculty of Medicine of the Labor University in Russia.)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Latest Smoking Cessation Method <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Scientific crystallization that cannot be denied; clearing away the heavy clouds for smokers</p>
<p>You should not think that smokers do not have the courage to practice smoking cessation methods. You must understand that nicotine is destroyed or even eliminated by tobacco toxins. If there are no tobacco toxins to refresh the mind, then fatigue, insomnia, yawning, nocturnal emission, and women's menstrual diseases will all appear one after another. Therefore, it is most difficult for smokers who have been smoking for many years to quit.</p>
<p>Quitting tobacco addiction cannot be effectively achieved by a single formula or tonification. It is necessary to replenish the whole body, including both hormones and egg yolk essence, in order to safely quit. Based on this principle, Dr. Melun of Germany invented the hormone egg yolk essence preparation "Butikang" and the female-specific "Bu Nü Rong", which are effective products for men and women to quit smoking. After taking them, one can definitely quit smoking painlessly.</p>
<p>Common Sense About Tuberculosis</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Latest Front Line in European and American Tuberculosis Sanatoriums <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

<p>(Clinic) Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road (Consultation Time) 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Including personal experimental examples</p>
<p>The treatment of tuberculosis has been discovered through scholars' continuous research that it is not sufficient to increase the number of lung connective tissue cells, which was previously thought to be the treatment of tuberculosis, but to contract the relaxation of the lungs and reduce its movement, that way, it can be cured without recurring.</p>
<p>Since this theory was discovered by Dr. Thumer (a tuberculosis expert) in Switzerland, the tuberculosis treatment community in various countries has regarded it as the criterion. Experimental studies by Dr. Feldmann M.D., director of the Dutch Tuberculosis Hospital, Dr. Wa Kfoff, director of the Tuberculosis Sanatorium in England, and Dr. Daguette, director of the Paris Tuberculosis Treatment Center, have all proved that Thumer's specific medicine for tuberculosis, "Bu Fei Na Er," not only has the effect of increasing connective tissue cells and preventing the spread of tuberculosis bacteria, but also has the ability to contract lung relaxation and make it quiet. Therefore, it has the great effect of stopping water, stopping bleeding, clearing thick sputum, and eliminating chest pain! When the lung is quiet, tubercle toxins will not flow into the blood, and symptoms such as night sweats and tidal fever will naturally disappear; appetite will increase and the body will be healthier! If you also have neurasthenia, insomnia, headache, nocturnal emission in men, irregular menstruation in women, etc., in addition to taking "Bu Fei Na Er", you should also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men or "Bu Nü Rong" for women to block weakness, and recover faster. It usually takes one or two months to recover.</p>
<p>Dr. Zheng's Clinical Experiment</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Su Shunhua from Hubei, 25 years old. Bleeding blood for two years, coughing with a lot of phlegm, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, extremely thin and weak. After taking "Bu Fei Na Er" and "Bu Ti Kang" for seven weeks, he was happily cured!</p>
<h3 id="e208">Talking About Leukorrhea in Nine Out of Ten Women <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Applying a comprehensive treatment</p>
<p>Why do women suffer from leukorrhea more often, while men never do? This is nothing more than the difference in the reproductive organs of the two sexes. The female vaginal tract is rich in secretory glands and is most easily attached to by bacteria. Diseases of the uterus, diseases of the ovaries, etc., are easily become leukorrhea, so there is a common condition of leukorrhea in nine out of ten women. The affected part is often infiltrated and eroded, the lower abdomen is swollen, urination is painful, and it is easy to cause irregular menstruation, chlorosis, etc. Therefore, problems also occur with conception. "Karsol Sedative Vaginal Tablets" have the effects of sterilization, antisepsis, anti-inflammation, pain relief, and secretion cessation. Therefore, it has special effects on women's leukorrhea. It can cure the disgusting leukorrhea in three or four courses. However, those who have already developed menstrual difficulties and neurasthenia can take "Bu Nü Rong" concurrently. Those who have been infected with gonorrhea due to unclean sexual intercourse and have developed leukorrhea can take "Clinon" internally, and still use this vaginal tablet as a suppository. It is even more comprehensive and meticulous treatment. It can also be treated secretly at home.</p>

<p>(Clinic:) Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation hours): 10 AM to 6 PM.</p>
<p>Management of Recurrent Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The recurrence of gonorrhea is the most detrimental to the condition, as each recurrence increases the gonorrhea bacteria's resistance. The most prone to recurrence is gonorrheal paraurethritis. Our urethra is thin and long, but the tube opening is as thin as a hair, so once gonorrhea bacteria enter through this small opening, they are not easily expelled. They then thrive in that location, causing repeated harm. Whenever there is sexual activity, drinking, strenuous exercise, or fatigue, they become active. However, after a brief period of recuperation, they remain dormant. Eventually, the urethra becomes swollen and painful, and pus accumulates, forming an abscess, which impairs the excretion of urine and ejaculation after intercourse. This causes lifelong suffering and poses a risk of infecting one's wife.</p>
<p>Mr. He Bingqing, residing on Niuzhuang Road, suffered from gonorrhea that recurred intermittently. His urethra was swollen, and urination was difficult. After reading my "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" (sold at Shanghai Dadong Bookstore), he sought treatment. After X-ray and electrotherapy, I prescribed "Kelinong" to combat gonorrhea and kill bacteria, eliminating all latent gonorrhea bacteria in the deep tissues. After taking it for five weeks, he returned for three follow-up examinations, and the condition was completely cleared. Blood tests were performed six or seven times, and no gonorrhea bacteria were found in any test, proving a radical cure. His wife's leukorrhea caused by gonorrheal infection was also treated with oral "Kelinong" and external "Carole's Vagina Tablets" as suppositories to eliminate the leukorrhea, and she recovered in three weeks. They have been living together ever since and now have a three-year-old son.</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Imperial University Medical School of Japan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang, whose name is withheld, has resided in Shanghai for many years. He suffers from thyroid swelling, with a tumor-like growth on his neck, incomplete development, decreased metabolic function, thickened skin with many wrinkles (as shown in Figure A), dulled senses, and a tendency to be sleepy. He has reproductive gland dysfunction, incomplete erectile strength, or even inability to achieve an erection, and also suffers from nocturnal emission, with or without dreams, three to four times a week. He has intellectual and mental impairments and poor memory, hence appearing foolish. This is a case of hypothyroidism. This condition not only impairs health but also makes it difficult to have children. He has been married for three years without conceiving. I treated his nocturnal emission with "Naiersi Nocturnal Emission Tablets" and also used "Butikang" as an oral medication to enhance the function of the thyroid and reproductive glands in the endocrine system, promoting normal development. After taking it for four weeks, the glandular swelling significantly reduced. He continued to take it, and after another two weeks, his development returned to normal. He became mentally alert, intelligent, and his sexual function gradually strengthened, returning to his pre-illness state. Not long after, he had a son. This proves that "Butikang" has the effect of invigorating the thyroid and sex glands, truly possessing the skill to rival nature.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Women's Diseases Where Patients Conceal Their Illnesses and Avoid Seeking Treatment <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Women often conceal their illnesses and avoid seeking treatment, and many difficult-to-treat diseases are commonly seen in women. Hence, the saying, "It is better to treat ten men than one woman," is insightful. For example, when a woman's ovarian function is abnormal, it causes menstrual irregularities. Moreover, their tendency to be sentimental irritates their nerves, leading to neurasthenia, anemia, reduced fat, a thin face, wrinkles on the forehead, prominent cheekbones, and a haggard appearance, insomnia, palpitations, and a constant flow of leukorrhea. It is difficult to expect such women to conceive.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition must involve promoting follicle-stimulating hormone to regulate menstruation and cure neurasthenia, insomnia, and other symptoms. The German "Bunurong" medicine has a special effect on the above-mentioned conditions. This tablet is made from female hormones to counteract and supplement the lack of various internal secretions. Therefore, it can cure menstrual irregularities and insomnia in a short period of time. After recovery, the spirit is lively, and the complexion is delicate and captivating. Madam Du Guiqing had long suffered from menstrual irregularities, insomnia, and vaginal discharge. Upon my recommendation, she took "Bunurong" and externally used "Carole's Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. She recovered in five or six weeks. It is no accident that "Bunurong" has become famous domestically.</p>
<p>Readers' Forum</p>
<p>The following medicines are all recommended by physicians who graduated from well-known domestic and foreign medical universities. Be sure to recognize the names of each medicine when purchasing. Do not be misled by others and mistakenly purchase miscellaneous inferior products, which will harm your condition!</p>
<p>Inability to Differentiate Semen from Turbid Urine</p>
<p>Editor: I mistakenly associated with a dissolute woman, and my urine became turbid and dripped, which has not been completely cured. Later, I also experienced nocturnal emission, and I was unable to differentiate semen from turbid urine, making my condition even worse. I purchased "Kelinong" and "Naiersi Nocturnal Emission Tablets" from Wing On Company and took them together. The turbid urine cleared, and the nocturnal emission stopped. In total, it took only about three weeks. (Jiang Wangni)</p>
<p>Asthma and Amenorrhea Editor: I have been suffering from amenorrhea for a long time and have been infertile since marriage. I have a weak mind and insomnia. Last winter, I also contracted asthma, which caused my face to turn pale, my mouth to turn white, and I could not lie down due to wheezing and profuse sweating. My husband purchased "Bunurong" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy for me, and after four weeks, my weak mind, insomnia, and other symptoms were completely cured, and my menstruation came on time. My body became healthier. However, what is the treatment for asthma? Please provide self-treatment guidelines? (Yue Lingzhen)</p>
<p>Answer: "Bofei Nar" is best for treating asthma.</p>
<p>Small Size</p>
<p>Editor: I masturbated when I was young, which caused my sexual organ to not develop and remain as small as a child's. I have no pleasure after marriage and suffer greatly from premature ejaculation. Please advise on treatment methods. (Guofu)</p>

<h3 id="e214">Disputes in the Huazhong Games <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>We have seen reports on the grand opening of the games for the four provinces of Huazhong (Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi). Regrettably, we have also seen reports of disputes, which seem to occur at every sports event. This case is remarkably similar to other cases (according to sports news from the 14th), starting with the disqualification of the Hubei team for being late to the 10,000-meter race. The Hubei team refused to accept the decision and injured Huang Yuanshu, a competitor from Anhui, and disrupted the competition. Eventually, He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, mediated, and the Hubei team took responsibility, apologized to the Anhui team, and punished the offenders.</p>
<p>Although this dispute was peacefully resolved quickly, we have seen the secrets of the field. This proves that our star system hinders athleticism. After athletes came back from Berlin with "duck eggs," this is another good lesson and answer to the star system.</p>
<p>We will analyze this conflict.</p>
<p>Such disputes are common in every event. Athletes violate the principles and lose rationality. Arriving late and getting disqualified is fair, and there is no reason not to accept it. If you disagree, you make a written complaint to the committee. Not knowing the rules can be forgiven, but disrupting order and even injuring athletes is unforgivable. It should be noted that Huang Yuanshu won the 10,000-meter race (according to news from Changsha on the 12th), proving the lack of rationality of the Hubei athletes. This should be severely punished.</p>
<p>We cannot place the full blame on the athletes. While athletes make irrational moves, their leaders and the system that encourages them, the star system, should take part of the blame. It will take a while to spread athletics to the masses. But looking at these senseless disputes, we cannot defend the star system.</p>
<p>If athleticism is narrowly for a few outstanding individuals to win on behalf of groups, schools, or nations, then Chinese athleticism is like bullfighting, just for entertainment and creating disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Visit to the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) In recent years, the call for rural improvement has spread across the country, but most practical methods and specific steps are still in the pilot stage. The Rural Improvement Association in Gaoqiao District of this city has already begun implementation. The purpose of its organization is to build a healthy unit with an autonomous organization, which, under the guidance of the municipal government, will become the most exemplary rural area in the city. It has been three years since its establishment. When it was first established, the late General Manager Mr. Shi Liangcai also provided great help to the association. Yesterday, I paid a special visit to the association. Mr. Zhang, the manager, received me and described in detail the internal organization and implementation of the work of the association:</p>
<p>The area served by the Improvement Association includes Gaoqiao and Gaoxing districts, totaling 338 villages and 6,683 households. The scope of work for the people in the two districts includes agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery. Therefore, the organization of the association is also quite extensive, proceeding in several aspects: (1) economy, (2) autonomy, (3) education, (4) hygiene, (5) agricultural affairs, and (6) crafts. There are dozens of service personnel, distributed in various districts, with Mr. Wang Kuizheng as the general manager. When it was first established, the funds were donated by local public-spirited individuals. Later, the regular expenses were stipulated to be 700 yuan per month for the first phase, 550 yuan for the second phase, and 400 yuan for the third phase, including salaries, food, and office expenses. Currently, it has reached the second phase, so the regular expenses have been reduced to 550 yuan per month. According to Mr. Zhang, although the expenses are limited by funds and cannot be abundant, they are still manageable according to the budget.</p>
<p>In terms of rural economic administration, the association has organized production mutual aid societies and cooperatives: (1) The establishment of production mutual aid societies aims to alleviate the economic panic of farmers, so that farmers will not stop production due to lack of capital. In terms of loan funds, it cooperates with the Agricultural Department of the Shanghai Bank. A total of 32 societies are set up in the general association and sub-districts. Each group of mutual aid members has at least five people and is jointly and severally liable for repayment. The use and amount of loans are subject to extremely strict investigation, and the standard is to meet the minimum needs of the borrowers. According to Mr. Zhang, for example, if planting five mu of land requires 1.5 yuan per mu for fertilization and 1 yuan for labor, then a loan of 10 yuan will be given. In terms of procedures, the borrower must first apply for registration, and then staff will be dispatched to investigate. If there is no fraud, the loan will be given. (2) The organization of cooperatives includes cooperative marketing of products and purchase of agricultural supplies, as well as the promotion of high-quality cotton seeds. It has cooperated with the Yangsi Cotton Field of the Central University to promote 2,500 kilograms of Jiangyin white seed cotton, and the results are good.</p>
<p>In terms of autonomy, the association divides the improved area into nine sub-districts to carry out the autonomous organization of the sub-districts. In terms of the people, in addition to the security corps and amateur military training classes, each branch association also generates a youth service corps. The organizational plan is divided into three phases. The first is the liaison phase, the second is the training phase, including literacy research, vocational guidance, academic lectures, and security training, and the last is the service phase. The service scope currently underway includes literacy schools, health propaganda, and home economics improvement.</p>
<p>The association's work in education is also quite complete. Yide Elementary School is established in Xinkangzhai, Gaoqiao, and all educational work is centered on this as a concentrated promotion point. The working situation is divided into: (1) A public library with more than 2,000 books and more than 1,005 magazines. The library is equipped with book inserts, mobile libraries, and educational outreach vehicles. It is also accompanied by displays of agricultural specimens for the public to browse. (2) Men's night school, located at the association's Xinkang office. According to reports, the students' level has reached above the third or fourth grade of elementary school, so they are now taught writing letters, abacus, English and other courses. (3) Women's night school, located in Yide Elementary School, is hosted by female staff in the area. There are 70 students, and the textbook is the literacy textbook for the common people issued by Shanghai City. (4) Running a small teacher training class to teach literacy in various houses in the district has now ended. There are more than a dozen small teachers who have graduated. (5) Appointed nine tea gardens to compile and post public wall newspapers, including three items: international, domestic, and local news. I went to visit a tea garden near Xijie and saw that the news collected on the wall newspaper was concise and clear, and the font was neat and large, which was very convenient for reading. There was also an inquiry and writing service attached to the place to reduce the difficulty of farmers in terms of writing.</p>
<p>The implementation work of agricultural affairs is that the association designated special contracted farmland to cooperate with farmers, giving them excellent varieties and guiding them in cultivation methods, so that farmers can obtain satisfactory harvests, and hold agricultural exhibitions from time to time to collect specimens and hanging pictures, using various citation methods to promote farmers' improvement and research. Mr. Zhang also mentioned that he had previously established a demonstration farm to plant wheat, green vegetables, and olives to test whether they were suitable for planting in the local soil. The trial has now been completed, and what is currently underway is to prepare for the establishment of a rural cotton ginning factory and a water-lifting cooperative.</p>
<p>The health work in the improved area is assisted by the Gaoqiao Health Office. In addition to investigating the general situation of deaths and diseases, farmers are educated on household cleaning and hygiene knowledge. In medical affairs, a public clinic is established to provide free diagnosis and treatment for farmers, and health and anti-drug campaigns are held from time to time.</p>
<p>The craft training includes women's embroidery classes. In Gaoqiao, women's embroidery is the main sideline, but the technology is too bad, so the works are too bad, and no one cares about them. Therefore, the association specially opened classes for training and tried to improve them. It is said that there are more than 40 graduates in the first session. Secondly, a rural craft society was established. In recent years, the city has been depressed, and industry and commerce have failed. Rural youths have no way out. Under this situation, the association has also promoted rural crafts, directed by Shi, and enrolled students to practice for six months to graduate. The initial products are rattan.</p>

<p>— Meiping</p>
<p>The moon hung like a sickle in the west of the sky, with no stars. The watchtower had already sounded the fifth watch. In this biting cold dawn, a black shadow suddenly shot across the city wall like an arrow. The watchtower sentry occasionally looked up and glanced at it, but the black shadow had agilely climbed over the city teeth, like a monkey, somersaulting and escaping over the high city wall, and falling into the grass pile at the foot of the wall.</p>
<p>This place is already near Beiguan. It is a wilderness with no people. Thorns and weeds are as high as sorghum stalks, taller than half a person. The black shadow crouched and used both hands as oars to break the weeds in front of him. He was in such a hurry that he didn't care about the skin on his hands, feet, or body being pierced by thorns, or perhaps already dripping with blood. He wanted to escape this wilderness in the shortest possible time and reach the pier outside Beiguan. There are small steamers heading east, west, north, and south on the pier. As long as he catches a boat, he will be a free body. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The wind blows the willow gently and gently. The Tingting floats gracefully and skillfully. I feel bored when I have nothing to do. Humming a song is good. I love you in the front building, listen carefully. Don't be annoyed. The conscience of every husband in the world is good. They work hard all day and night. Thousands of catties are for hard work. The heart is delicate and small. How can you not eat?</p>

<p>The wind blows the willow lightly and lightly. The slight calculation is slow and refreshing. Family matters are in the heart. A song is sung. My love in the front building, don't ring. Pay attention to what I want to say. Many family members in the world have no ending. The temperament is inherently dissolute. The behavior is too absurd. Love is not long. Change your mind casually. Cause so many disasters. Alas, one life is gone.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Long-Awaited War Film "Serve the Country Faithfully" to Be Released <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox has put all its efforts this year into filming "Serve the Country Faithfully," also known as Road to Glory, setting a new record in the history of war films. Just consider the three main actors in the film: Frederic March, Warner Baxter, and Lionel Barrymore. These three stars are all capable of carrying a film on their own. Now that they are acting together in one film, it is naturally even more worth seeing. In addition, the director of this film, Howard Hawks, is a leading figure specializing in war films. Therefore, the war scenes in this film are even more intense than "All Quiet on the Western Front." It is said that Chinese leader President Chiang Kai-shek, admiring the film's reputation, had it specially transported to Lushan to watch it himself. The film will soon be released in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Aviation Film "China Clipper" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Showing at the Grand Theater Tonight</p>
<p>Warner Bros.' latest historical aviation blockbuster, "China Clipper," is scheduled to be shown at the Grand Theater starting at 7:15 PM tonight (Friday). The film stars a dozen major stars, including Pat O'Brien, Beverly Roberts, and Ross Alexander. It depicts the brave and sacrificial spirit of a group of aviation pioneers, who risk their lives in stormy skies to fulfill their ambitions. The story is based on the long-distance flight of the "China Clipper" on the Pan American route not long ago, which started from Alameda on the Pacific coast near San Francisco and ended in the Philippine Islands. The film's purpose is to encourage the spirit of adventure and stimulate progressive thinking. The tense and exciting performances are even more commendable, especially at a time when we are shouting "Aviation to Save the Country." Everyone should appreciate this film.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Regarding "Happiness is Coming" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The two films directed by Yue Feng, "Happiness is Coming" and "Auspicious Patterns," have both been completed one after another. It is said that after "Little Sisters," Xinguang will show "Happiness is Coming."</p>
<p>"Happiness is Coming" stars Zhou Xuan, Ma Luofen, Guan Hongda, Qin Tong, Zhao Jingna, Liang Dusheng, and other major stars. The plot of the play takes exposing the inside story of a large family as its theme, and is full of humorous and funny gags. All dozens of scenes will make you laugh until your stomach hurts and tears come to your eyes.</p>
<p>The script for "Happiness is Coming" was written by Huang Jiamo. According to Huang, the play depicts the extravagance and depravity of wealthy families in rural villages, doing all kinds of evil. In particular, the lecherous old men covet the village girls, using all sorts of tricks, and making countless jokes. It truly combines satire, humor, and slapstick in one. I don't believe that anyone who watches this play won't laugh wildly.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan was borrowed by Xinhua to star in "Carnival Night," which received great praise. This time, her performance in "Happiness is Coming" is even more brilliant. She plays a bride who is robbed halfway. Later, she hides in a coffin and suffocates the wealthy and unkind old man to death. It is truly full of twists and turns, and makes people's imagination run wild. The mystery in this cannot be broken until it is seen at the public screening.</p>
