<p>南京　蔣副主席六日在中央黨部紀念週報告、原詞如下、各位同志、今天我們舉行新年第一次總理紀念週、兄弟在上次紀念週中、已講明我們本黨同志、應盡的責任、特別是五全大會以後、大家應有的覺悟的努力、在前次紀念週中、又將我們做人和革命建國的大道、扼要的向大家報告、主要的意思是說、我們要做人、一定有做人的道理、我們要革命、一定有革命的道理、我們要治理國家、建設國家、也一定有治國建國的道理、而且這些道理、是關連一貫的、是一定不易的我們必須遵循這個道理來努力、然後才能成功、我們到現在、做人還沒有做成、現代國民革命、還不能成功、新的國家還沒有建立、都是因為不得其道、即所謂人事未盡、絕對不可以歸之於天數命運、所以我們如果不明白這個做人革命和建國的道理、並且照着這個道理來努力、只是懵懵懂懂混過去、那末一定到最後失敗了、甚至弄到國家亡了、還不知道是什麽原因、所以我們不可不明此大道、隨時省察、而自强不息、日新其德、無論我們個人或是一個黨一個國空、都要有「日新又新」的精神、能繼續不斷的進步、然後才能生存發展、完成一切新的事業、開拓全新的生命、我們要能使自己個人和社會國家、能够日新又新、最要緊的一件事、就是要勤於反省、與勇於改過、並且要大家互相勸勉、親切琢磨、如果我們一般同志見到別人有錯誤、而不以親愛精誠的態度來規勸他、視同志如路人、以為他的錯誤無干己事、漠不關心、那就失了革命黨員的本分、其結果、無論黨員和黨、一定都無進步、我們自己也就對不起黨、對不起自己的同志了、因此我現在有一件事情、不得不先提出來和各位說一說、今天各位同志出席紀念週、我看到大家的精神都很好、一切都很整飭、很有秩序、心裏覺得很快慰、如果有一兩位同志、衣服雖然穿得整齊、而鞋子却沒有檢點、隨便穿着平常在寢室裏穿的鞋子、走進大禮堂來、出席總理紀念週、這實在是有些失檢、大家要曉得、我們一切事業、要從本身的修養做起而本身的修養、最基本最實際最容易表現出來的事物、就事食衣住行四項、至於服裝、又是時時穿着隨緊在身的東西、其重要更可想可知、所以一定要求由裏而外、從上至下、眞正整齊清潔、像我剛才所舉的一個穿睡鞋的例、雖然衣冠都很整潔、但是隨便穿了限於室內着用的鞋子、進到大禮堂、便是顧下不顧下、不合規矩了、大家不要以為這是一件小事、要知道我們革命黨做事、最要緊的一種精神、就是要澈底實在、無論什麽事物、一定要從上到下、澈裏澈外、實實在在完完全全的做好、絕不可見上遺下、有名無實、只講一個表面的形式、而無內在眞實的精神、過去我們一般人和一切機關、作事的毛病、就是在此、本黨自國民政府成立、担負治國的責任以來、已經有八年之久、其所以到現在還不能治好國家的原因、也是在此、從此以後、我們必須改過這種毛病、一切要實事求是、澈底做好、例如服裝一項、我們一定要從頭到脚、從裏衣到外衣、都能整潔、尤其是辦事和參加集會的時候、更要格外整齊、我們一切生活行動、要如此澈底實在和整齊劃一、若用現代的話來講、就是所謂「軍事化」「紀律化」、也就是我們所提倡的「禮義廉恥」之「禮」、古人講「禮者即事之治也……若無禮則手足無所措、耳目無所加、進退揖讓無所制、……田獵戎事失其策、軍旅武功失所制……官失其體、政治失其旋、加於身而措於前、凡眾之動失其宜、如此則無以祖洽於眾也」、已經講明「禮」就是指一切事物的秩序、就是講一切要紀律化、所以我們可以很簡明確切的解釋、「禮」就是「軍事化「、我們一個人、如果不明禮——不是軍事化、便不能成為一個現代的國民、更不能做一個現代的革命黨員、同樣一個社會或一個國家、如果無禮——不是軍事化、便不成其為現代的社會、現代的國家、便不能生存於現世界、所以我們如果要作現代的國民、要建立自由平等、能與世界各國並駕齊驅的現代國家、就非極力「尚武」、切實并澈底「軍事化」不可、所謂「尚武」和「軍事化」、并不是個個人要帶槍帶砲、而是要個個人能够修養「知信仁勇嚴」之武德、能够「明禮義知廉恥、負責任、守紀律」、從我們食衣住行等日常實際生活做起、一切要紀律化軍事化、也就是所謂「科學化」「現代化」、這一段話的意思、是指明兄弟所看到一兩同志的缺點、同時希望我們大家要互相勉勵實行、眞下「整齊劃一」合乎「禮義廉恥」、之「軍事化」的新生活、其次、兄弟前回在紀念週席上已講明大學之道、就是我們做人革命和建國最基本重要的道理、並且將大學之道的三個綱領、——所謂「在明明德」「在親民」「在止於至善」向大家解釋明白、今天再要繼續前次所講的意思、將大學之道的八項節目、和各位講一講、大學原經「故之欲明明德於天下者、先治其國、欲治其國者、先齊其家、欲齊其家者、先修其身、欲修其身者、先正其心、欲正其心者、先誠其意、欲誠其意者、先致其知、致知在格物」、接着再說、「物格而后致知致知而后意誠意誠而后心正、心正而后身修、身修而后家齊、家齊而后國治、國治而后天下平」這兩叚話、就是由終而始、再由始而終的反復指明我們由做人以至平天下八個緊要的節目、與合理的階叚、總理對於這一叚、由本而末、由內而外、由小而大、由近而遠之精微開展的政治哲學、極端贊佩、他說「大學中庸所說的格物致知誠意正心修身齊家治國平天下、那一叚話、把一個人從內發揚到外、由一個人的內部做起、推到平天下止、像這樣精微開展的理論……、就是我們政治哲學的智識中獨有的寶貝」、我們革命最後、最大的目的、就是要做到「世界大同」、就是要「平天下」、也就是要「明明德於天下」、所謂「明明德於天下」者、就是要令天下一切的人、都能發揮其固有的光明純正　明美善之德性、換言之、就是要使世界人類都能臻於文明康樂之境、世界人類、要如何才可以臻於文明康樂之境呢、這就是要實現我們總理的三民主義、所以「明明德於天下」這一句話之理實的政治的眞義、就是　使全世界人類、個個人信仰並奉行三民主義、使三民主義的光輝、普遍照耀於全世界、使全人類都能革除過去一切不光明正大、不合乎公理正義之心理和事物、而造成和平康樂光華燦爛的新世界、新文明、但是這個理想很高、這個目的很遠、我們要達到這個平天下的目的、一定要「先治其國」、就是先要將我們自己的國家治理好、先要使人們全國國民一切思想行動生活習慣能够澈底革新、實實在在篤信並力行三民主義、建設一個文明强盛之三民主義的新國家出來、必須先做到了這一步、然後才能使世界人類、都信仰並力行三民主義日新其固有之天德、共同來建立一個和平康樂的大同世界、如果我們自己的國民、仍舊污穢愉惰、萎靡不振、做了一種落伍的野蠻的人、我們的社會國家、始終是紛亂黑暗脆弱貧困、不像一個現代的社會和現代的國家、那末不論三民主義如何博大高明、不論我們的理想如何高尚美滿、人家無論如何不會佩服、不會相信、無論如何三民主義不會普遍實行於全世界、所以說「古之欲明明德於天下者先治其國」、但是國家很大的、國民是很多的、國事是很繁雜的、我們要治好一個國家、當然也不是隨便可以做到、必須先由一部分一部分做起、所以說「欲治其國者先齊其家、」所謂「家」照字義呆板的解釋、就是「家庭」、不過我們應推廣家庭的意思、泛指全國的家家戶戶、或國家以內一切團體機關和社會、例如我們的革命黨、就是一個家庭、我們一個學校、也可以說是一個家庭、所謂「齊家」、就是要從我們各人所屬的家庭學校機關團體、和所在的社會做起、利用政治和敎育上一切方法、使全國家家戶戶之事事物物、都能整整齊齊有條有理、社會上個個人都能有理守法、秩序井然、尤其是在經濟方面、要照孔子所謂「均無貧、和無寡、安無傾、」的理想、藉調查統計調整合作等一切有效的手段、來求得合理的分配、使人民的生活和社會的生存、得到平衡普遍的發展、大家食衣住行等一切物質生活、絕無過分的懸殊、與很大的不平、然後社會才能根本上求其安定和平、整齊劃一、我們要使一個家庭、一個團體、一個黨或一個社會、能够事事整齊劃一、有條有理又要從什麽地方做起呢、大學上說、「欲齊其家者先修其身」、一切要有我們本身的修養做起、講到修身的重要、兄弟實在非常慚愧懴悔、我想如果自己個人早能遵守總理的敎訓、照着我們固有的最寶貴的政治哲學、來努力修身的話、我們國家社會應當不致如現在這樣危險紊亂、一般青年也一定不致如現在這樣痛苦、現在國家社會一切之所以不能治好、就是因為我們一般黨命黨員過去沒有注意修身、不能事事以身作則、不能使民眾相信我們革命黨員、說什麽就能做到什麽、像過去那樣只知道貼標語喊口號、發宣言、而不能身體力行、實事求是、那裏有不失敗的道理、古人說、「為政不在多言、顧力行如何耳」、又說「其身正、不令而行、其身不正、雖令不從」、可見我們今後要領導民眾、要改造社會、治好國家、只有實實在在從修身做起、修身的第下工夫、就是要革新自憶的生活習慣、實行「整齊清潔簡樸勤勞迅速確實」的新生活、不過「身者心之器」、我們一切習慣的革新、還只是發露於外部的修養、其眞實的根本工夫、還在乎包藏於內體之心意、必須心正意誠、然後眞能言行端美而毫無虛偽、所以說「欲修其身者先正其心、欲正其心者、先誠其意」、所以我們無論何時何地、必須克制邪念、平息意氣、凝聚心神、端正意向、並且所將的話、所作的事、隨時要自己審查、一切要「仰不愧於天、俯不愧於人」、「裁之吾心而安、揆之天理而順」、（未完）</p>

<p>倫敦　軍縮會議之如何進展、全繫英國之態度而定、然若有提議質與量併行審議、則會議將瀕危機、惟日本之一樓希望、最初以為共同最大限原則或能被承認、若然則將不反對併行審議、但迄今該希望已歸泡影、故决定絕對反對併行審議、外國方面之觀測、頗以為日本將承認併行審議、故日本代表部或將向外人記者團表明、日本何故在未决定量的問題時、拒絕討論質的問題、（五日電通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日本於去年委員會時、實際已表明與英美兵力量之均等要求、故英美態度愈益强化、英美委員且公然宣稱、日本若參加會議則萬難妥協、因此軍縮會議若依目卞情形、遲早不免决裂、故大有僅由英美法意四國締結質的恊定、並通吿日本、進行將道德責任亦歸由日本負之之計劃、然日本絕不顧慮此類策謀、决以獨自之態度、始終邁進、（六日電通電）</p>

<h3>日本的新聞統制政策</h3>
<p>— 鄭宏述</p>
<p>國際通信社的背景，現狀與趨勢，不僅為行政外交當局及國際問題專家所當深切瞭解，而且也是生在這大時代的每一閱報者應有的常識。</p>
<p>最近日本外務省情報部長天羽英二氏大談其『外交戰上通信的威力』：他以為歐戰時德國的失敗，最大原因之一是通信方面受到英國封鎖的威脅；英國利用海底電綫的獨占，一方面截斷德國的通信網，一方面向全球宣傳德國的橫暴，於是使德國失却世界視聽而終歸失敗。這使他想起日本未來的命運而感慨地說：『日本與外國間所有的海底電錢差不多全屬英美支配，各報章所揭載的國際新聞都向英美支配下的通信社轉買，幾無自由獨立可言：我們每天所讀的國際新聞全依賴於外國的通信機，外國通信社，外國通信具的傳遞輸送，倘一朝有事，如何得了？這使我不由得覺着危懼！卽在平常無事的時候，每日儘管這樣將外國供給的新聞生吞活剝，也不免為我國新聞界的實情撫然長嘆！要脫離這種受國外牽制的桎梏，我與二三位同僚都堅决認定：卽使擱置了其他的建設，也非先成立個第一流的通信社以供給獨立自主的國際新聞不可。』其實日本固有的新聞聯合社（簡稱聯合）與電報通信社（簡稱電通），固然都與外國各大通信社訂定合同，聯合由英國的路透，法國的哈瓦斯（Agency　Havas），美國的A.P.（Associated　Press　of　America美國聯合通信社簡的略稱），蘇聯的塔斯（Tass　Agency），意大利的斯蒂芬尼（Agenzia　Stefani）等系統的通信社供給，電通則差不多純為美國A.P.系統電報的翻譯，但在我國的活動，允其是將我國新聞放送全世界這一點上，是已經占了很大的利益，負了很大的使命的。不過以世界制覇為目標的日本自然不肯就此滿足，而且目下又是不亞於歐戰發生當時的國際宣傳戰時代，由於客觀事實的逼迫與主觀慾望的需要，就有以獨立自主為號召的同盟通信社應運而生。</p>
<p>同盟通信社的成立，一方面是日本政府企圖問鼎英美數十年來在世界新聞播送上的領導權，一方面是對內實行新聞統制政策的新展開，前者如成立前美國聯合通訊社的提出抗議，成立當時遞相望月以追踪路透社為該社使命的宣言，以及成立後英美法各報的論難等都足證明。後者則日本政府企圖統制新聞已非一日，聯合與電通合併的計劃，早於三年前因『焦土外交』而聞名世界的內田前外相擬定，而且已得到軍部的援助與兩社的同意，現外相廣田繼任，對於這一點却是蕭規曹隨，向電通社長光永星郞幾度接洽收買辦法，但目下却突然方向轉換，另行成立新設的同盟通信社，此中必然有一段玄妙的曲折。</p>
<p>這種曲折在政治社會的立塲上說：是統制主義與自由主義的鬥爭；在經濟的觀點看來，則為大資本與中小資本的角逐。</p>
<p>為日本固有宣傳機關的聯合電通兩通信社中，聯合於昭和元年（西一九二六）成立，原由東方通信社與國際通信社蛻化，以東京朝日新聞，大阪朝日新聞，東京日日新聞，大阪每日新聞，時事新報，報知新聞，國民新聞與中外商業等八大報館為基礎；每年受外務省三十萬至五十萬圓的津貼，簡直可以說是政府的御用機關，所以對於政府的意志無不順從；但於明治三十三年（西一九〇〇）成立，較有悠長歷史的電通社却為光永星郞的私人企業，因之日本政府能吾貫澈內田前外相的合併計劃，以增加對內對外的宣傳效率，就得看收買電通社的步驟可吾達到。</p>
<p>政府的買收交涉起初非常順利，收買費先前是二百萬圓，並由內田前外相的推薦而使光永星郞為勅選貴族院議員；現外相廣田繼任後，在理應該功德圓滿，合併計劃卽可實施，統制目的卽可達到，不料光永星郞却突然變更態度，根據以下的理由不得不與政府破的：</p>
<p>一，與電通有密切關係的北海時報，福岡日日新聞，名古屋新聞等各地有力報館堅决反對政府收買。</p>
<p>二，電通的基本社員比聯合尙多百人以上，倘一旦知道收買成立，必起動搖，且其間大多數均抱反感。</p>
<p>三，三十六年來的堅苦奮鬥，好容易社務蒸蒸日上；而且原有的資本金已在百萬元以上，今受政府二百萬元卽將社內社外通盤讓渡，未免過於廉價。</p>
<p>此種反對政府收買論調，堅持最力的是北海時報社長東武，名古屋新聞社長小山松壽等，於是由政府讓步，將二百萬元的收買價增至二百五十萬元；但與電通有密切關係的各報館却仍堅持反對，使政府企圖合併聯合電通的初步計劃不得不宜吿失敗。三年來日本新聞統制的呼聲雖然高入雲霄，事實上却遲遲未能斷然實現者以此。不過日本政府的新聞統制是有整個計劃的，絕不能因為初步步驟的失敗而中止，於是將方向轉換，以素來受御用的新聞聯合社為母體，加上日本放送協會及全國各大報館，成立了這個稱為『世界第一流』的同盟通信社。</p>
<p>同盟通信社的成立，並非日本政府放棄收買電通的原有計劃，實在是强化統制主義的陣容，顯示巨大資本的壓力，使電通與北海時報，福岡日日，名古屋新聞等地方報館不得不趨於屈服而已！政府對於收買電通的折衝，往常原以外務當局為主力，自從同盟通信社成立，也就改由遞信省出面交涉，外務與軍部則由側面加以援助。最近秋田淸氏受望月遞相非正式的委托，奔走於電通及各地方報館之間，勸吿他們趕快參加同盟通信社，但事實上電通等與同盟通信社間的對立恐怕已成必至的形勢。電通等倘能接受勸吿而加入同盟，則三年來日本新聞統制的問題卽可吿一段落。否則須視電通的能力能吾與政府支持下的同盟通信社抗衡，北海時報，福岡日日名古屋新聞等地方報館，年來因為農村凋敝而失却大部分的讀者，及朝日，日日等的侵入內地，在門司，名古屋設立支社，給與她們以很大的威脅，她們的生命大都依存於電通，所以日本新聞統制問題的歸趨，還得看電通願不願加入同盟通信社，能不能與同盟通信社永恒地對立，換句話說：也就是日本政府以成立同盟通信社為收買電通的第二步策略能吾奏效。</p>

<h3>福州　去年商業衰落</h3>
<p>福州變為入超口岸　各業對外貿易退縮</p>
<p>福州通訊、閩省商埠、只有兩處、一為福州、一為厦門、閩東北貨物、均由福州進出、閩西南貨物、則由厦門進出、惟福州向為出超口岸、厦門向為入超口岸、乃去年福州出口貨物、大見减少、變為入超口岸、極引起經濟家之注意、茲將福州去年商業衰落情形、分述於下、</p>
<p>茶葉茶為閩省出口貨大宗、產自閩北建甌·崇安·政和·浦城·各縣、及閩東福安·福鼎·寗德·霞浦·壽寗·各縣、多銷於歐美各國、及華北東北各省、以前出口貨値、年在一千餘萬元、旋因印度錫蘭各地產茶競銷、民十以後、銷額遞减、加以茶商故步自封、泥守成法、益難與外茶抗衡、近則本產茶、年多一年、再以東北事變之後、抽收關稅、增重成本、銷額因之短絀、華北銷路、亦逐年减少、歐美各國、因日茶價廉、華茶不能與之競爭、去年出口、祗有四百餘萬元、幸本省所產之紅綠茶葉及白毫、天然之芬香氣味、國外人士多有嗜之、故國際貿易、不至斷絕、惟去年茶商首春採辦之茶、正在焙製時間、銷地價格、每担跌落八兩左右、各茶棧均虧蝕不貲、倒閉數家、</p>
<p>杉木·杉木亦為閩省出口貨大宗、採辦者有兩浙八帮、及天台長五帮、運銷浙江、天津·長江·台灣·各帮、以前銷額、亦有一千餘萬元、現在因外國木價、比較我國杉木低廉、銷額因之减少、閩北各縣木客、砍造木排運省者、因售價低落、多受虧折、卽本市杉木行、亦多宣吿歇業、去年出口數、僅値三百餘萬元、</p>
<p>紙張·閩北各縣產紙、多數行銷華北各埠、及東北四省、銷額年有二三百萬元、自東北版圖不屬我有之後、彼亦仿製低價之紙傾銷、閩紙運抵該地、且須完納關稅、多此一重負担、更難與之競銷、東北銷路、幾吿斷絕、華北亦受彩響、本巿經營紙業商號、虧折極鉅、銷路旣减、在山造紙廠槽、歇業亦多、去年出口、僅有七八十萬元、華北銷路、仍極呆滯、惟上月海紙售價、每塊尙有略增幾分、</p>
<p>笋業·筍產於閩北各縣、於秋末冬初、竹頭方始生筍、為數不多、類皆以生筍運往滬津各埠銷售、迨冬末春初、則因出產數量已多、用以曬乾、製為玉蘭片、至春季出產數量極多、則曬為筍乾、每百斤十餘元至二十餘元、去年因各地水災、購買力益見薄弱、價格跌落十分之二、銷路大减、全年銷額不及三十萬元、</p>
<p>漆器·以沈紹安牌號為最老、出品亦最優、銷路極暢、輸出各省及南洋各島、歐美各國、最盛時、年有一百餘萬元、近年受國際金融緊縮影響、及南洋各島商業衰敗、銷路銳减、年甚一年、現在銷額、每年僅有二十餘萬元、去年參加靑島鐵展會、江蘇國展會、台灣博覽會售賣、共得五萬餘元、漆器商認此、頗以為獲些裨益也、</p>
<p>紙傘·自民四改良之後、輸出南洋羣島、銷額年達一百餘萬元、惟自民十以後、南洋經濟衰落、銷路日見减少、傘商為競爭計、互相貶價、以劣品充數、信譽因之墜落、銷額只有四五十萬元、去年經該業工商自動禁用牛皮紙造傘、冀挽回對外貿易、由關係方面、合組紙傘出口檢査機關、以堅信譽、現採辦出口之紙傘商、僅有吳敬記及金山商行等數家、</p>
<p>角梳·角梳出品、運銷南洋最多、民元以前、銷額年可二十餘萬元、近年受化學製造之出品影饗、本巿如鄒振記·潤光厚等號、亦力加改良、至為優美、終因價格較化學製為昂、難與競銷、以致銷額日見减少、上年不及五萬元、</p>
<p>竹篾一項·運銷華北、轉售東北為多、從前每年售額的有三四十萬元、至民二十以前、尙有二十萬元之譜、自九一八事變之後、銷路大受影響、現在全年不及數萬元、</p>
<p>刺繡·閩省刺繡出品、尙見優良、分銷國內外、年額約達十餘萬元、近年各省銷路、幾至斷絕、卽國外南洋各島銷額、亦大銳减、最近每年出品只有三萬餘元、</p>
<p>古董·水部門·南門外·總督後·各地所製本頭古董、製工精巧、裝璜美術、頗受歐美各國及南洋羣島歡迎、以前每年輸出、計有三十餘萬元、營此業起家者、大有其人、近年受經濟衰落影響、銷額不過五六萬元、製造古董商店歇業者、何只半數、（一月四日）</p>

<h3>教育播音專刋　師範敎育之趨勢（上）</h3>
<p>— 中央大學敎育系主任　常道直</p>
<p>自從上次世界大戰以來，無論是澈底改造的蘇聯，部分改革的德·意·或勉維現狀的英·法，在其敎育制度和精神上，都經過了一番革新或修正；其中關於師範敎育部份之改革，均佔極重耍的地位。我們一再從近代歷史上看到一個國家每逢遭遇了非常的變故以後，在其全部政治的，經濟的，和文化的再生運動上，往往伴隨着一種新的敎育計劃，而在這整個的計劃中，師範敎育，每被視為實現此新計劃之關鍵。近代各國在承平時代，似乎對於社會上層階級子女之敎育，臨以較多的注意，等到遇了「民族競存」之生死關頭，才被迫地不得不盡力普及敎育於廣大的民衆。試一翻閱近代各國厲行普及敎育之歷史，便可以證實近代師範敎育機關，乃是專為造就此類初等敎育之師資而創設。</p>
<p>師範敎育旣然是應普及初等敎育之需要而產生，那末他的組織外形和訓練內容，必然要取决於初等敎育之性質與功能。我們要了解近代師範敎育之本質及其最近的傾向，不可不先將此點加以解釋。</p>
<p>原來在上决世界大戰以前，歐洲各國學制，多採行雙軌式：所有以普及初等敎育為主旨之公立初等學校，均係為社會下層民衆之子女而設；至於出身貴族和豪富家庭的兒童則概經由私立或公立預備學校，而中學，而大學。兩者殊途異趨，各不相涉，故有雙軌制之稱。當時政府的意思，認為對於一般民衆只須授以寫讀算之基本知能，並養成其忠順，虔敬，勤勞等習性；從而此等學校之師資，也只須備具傳授此等簡易知能之學識和技術，便一切認為滿意。英國於一八四六年所採行之敎生制（Papil　Teacher　System）可作為例證。按該制，凡有志充任小學敎師者，可於年齡達十三歲時，就一初等學校首席敎師，訂立五年契的，從其學習敎授技能，並補充其普通學識。此制在形式上及精神上，完全沿襲工商界所盛行之藝徒制。由此所產出之敎師，其學識與見界絕不致超越一般小學所需要之範圍以外的。</p>
<p>十九世紀中葉，政治上傾向保守之歐洲各國政府，都認定師範學校之課程超越敎授小學所需的最低限度，不惟非必要，而且是有害的。法國一八四八年臨時政府敎育委員會之報吿中即非難當時師範學校課程內容高出一般小學敎師服務上所需之程度以上，而認為此等訓練殊不適於鄕校敎師之狹窄而凡席的職務；且云『彼等將必然的，由不滿意現狀而傾向極端危險之政治的社會的理想』。該委員會認為理想的敎師應常是「思慮單純的，勤懇的，其需要當如其欲望之為有限的；對於他，他的生徒和他的鄕里便是他的全整的世界。」</p>
<p>同樣，普魯士政府，自一八四零年以來，除竭力抑制政治的，宗敎的異端以外，同時並對師範學院實行壓迫，常局者之意，謂當時一般社會及敎育界之騷動情形，乃由師範學院課程過涉高深所致；「由課程過於高深，所引起之野心，旣無實現可能，於是遂對其現前地位，感覺不滿足；並且煽動他人亦發生不滿足之感」。本此理由，遂擬大加限制師範學校之課程。一八四四年，又以政府命令禁止師範生任意無監導的涉獵圖書館中之藏書，以免分散其注意力，並令視學員特別注意學生所得誦讀之書目。一切情形與法國所表見者如出一轍。</p>
<p>十九世紀歐洲各國師範敎育上，尙有一共通點，即師範學校之學生皆以募自畢業小學者為主體。前面已經說過，在雙軌學制之國家，小學校乃為社會下層民衆之子女而設，因此師範學校所收容之學生自亦不能軼出此範圍。其結果，乃於無意間形成「種階級政策；即小學校之生徒及其敎師常為出身同一社會階級者。全套初等敎育由初等小學，而高等小學（或師範預科）而師範本科，自成一體系；通過全體系之各階叚後，復回到小學任敎，自為一循環。茲再舉例，說明如後：</p>
<p>法國：現制師範學校之入學資格通常為修畢高等小學普通科課程，三年；高小普通科可視為師範預科，其入學資格為年齡至少達十二歲，並持有初等小學證書。</p>
<p>德國：舊制師範生乃錄自修畢國民小學八年之畢業生，先人預備科三年，然後升入師範學院三年，</p>
<p>師範生所修習之學程，全然依據小學敎學之需要而規定，故其所歷經之教育年限，雖然有時長於一般中學，但因其所習無與高深學術之凖備硏究，事實上乃絕少升入大學之機會。在實行此種師範學制之國家，其師範學校與小學在國家敎育行政機關乃隸屬於同一主管司之下。例如法國教育部之初等敎育司所掌理之學校即包括幼兒學校，初等小學，高等小學，師範學校，以及訓練師範學校師資之高等初級師範學校，（共有二所，男女各一，不可與訓練中學師資之高等師範學校相混淆），將全部初等敎育組成一獨立的自足的體系，在法國可算得貫澈到極峯了。</p>
<p>前述法德兩國之師範敎育組織，可以視為十九世紀之代表的制度，十九世紀末葉以來，各國遠見的敎育家和敎育事業團體，逐漸表示對於當前敎育制度之不滿意；同時社會政治經濟形勢之推移，也使原始的初等敎育觀念不得不根本改變。概括言之，現代的小學敎育與歐戰以前不同之處可歸納為以下各點：</p>
<p>前决之小學乃是專為社會下層民衆而設，現代之小學逐漸成為全體的國民，在各依其志願，能力與興趣，受個別分化的敎育以前，所必須經歷之共同生活的階級。</p>
<p>前决之小學每有意或無意地，成為維持現前社會階級的分野之一種工具，現代的小學則特意地以羣集來自各種社會階級之兒童於一堂，乘其階級意識尙未形成以前，使共營協同的生活藉以發展其同心同德之精神，乃是化除人間階級畛域之最有效的手段。</p>
<p>前此之小學以傳授國民基本知能，造成馴服易使之民衆為目的，現代之小學則以端正兒童之身體的，道德的和知能教育之始基為任務。</p>
<p>從上述之小學教育新觀念，自然產生對於新型式的師資之要求。換言之，要使現代小學能够擔負此種新的使命，必須從訓練新時代的師資着手。以下先列叙各國現行師範學制之大概，然後將其所表現出來之特殊精神提要說明，藉以指示現代師範敎育之一般的趨勢。</p>
<p>現代各國之初等學校師資訓練機關，依其在全部學制中之地位，有仍未能脫出中等敎育之階段者，有已進而列於高等學府之林者：前者為法·意·俄等國，後者為英·德·兩國：美國之師範學校亦傾向以完全中學卒業為入學必備資格，似與英·德·現制頗相近似，惟美國之中學程度，通常較歐洲中學為低，故其師範學校尙未能與英·德·之師資訓練機關並駕齊驅，以下逐一列舉其現制之梗概：</p>
<p>法國：現行師範敎育制度，已於前面提及，凡修完師範學校課程，畢業考試及格者得充任試任敎員或臨時敎員，經二年後，通過敎育資格證書之考試，始得被仟為正式敎員。</p>
<p>意大利：敎師學院之修業期間共七年：初級科四年是為師範預科性質，高級科三年，是為師範本科。初級科之入學程度為小學，四年修畢。凡修畢敎師學院高級科，通過畢業考試者，得受初等學校敎師資格證書，但欲獲得正式任用者，尙須通過一次競爭考試，及格後，再試任敎職三年，並經視學員之推薦始得為正敎員。</p>
<p>蘇聯：小學（即所謂「四年制學校」）師資之主要訓練機關為敎育專科學校，共入學資格為「七年制學校」（約當小學四年初中三年）修業期問定為四年，在第一五年計劃時候，因急速擴張小學之故，以致師資供不應求，乃不得不多設二週的及一月的短期訓練班。據云入此等短期科者，共以前所受之正式教育，往往未能超過「四年制學校」之程度。</p>
<p>美國：訓練小學師資之機關及辦法頗形複雜，其程度亦至不齊。大抵鄉村小學師資之訓練場所，多為附設於中學校之師資訓練科，但都巿小學敎師所受，訓練顯見較為完善，自一九二〇年以來，趨向以中學卒業後，益以兩年之師範訓練為最低限度之標凖，其機關為州立·縣立·市立·或私立之師範學校及敎師學院。</p>
<p>英國：小學師資之訓練機關為單獨設置之訓練學院及附屬於大學之訓練部。訓練學院之入學資格為修畢中學課程，通過中學第一試並年齡已達十八歲者，大學訓練部之入學資格須已達十七歲，通過大學入門考試或通過中學第一試所得績分，足以免除其大學入門考試者。後者之入學資格稍嚴。訓練學院修業期間二年：修完規定學程，考試及格且實際敎學能力，經敎育部視學員認為滿意者，便得受領憑證，再經一年之試用期，便得被承認為「檢定的敎師」。大學訓練部之修業期間共四年；前三年專修習大學學位所必需之課程，末一年實施專業的訓練。全部學程修完，由大學舉行考試結束之。通過此項考試者授以敎育證書，持有者可據以取得初等學校敎師文憑，如該受試者業已獲有小學敎學之實際經騐。</p>
<p>德國：按一九一九年之聯邦憲法第一四三條「敎師之訓練辦法常依據適能於高等敎育之一般原則，為全國劃一的規定」是歐仗後德國各邦師範學制改造之凖據，依憲法條文之含義，師資訓練機關之入學程度，當與一般大學之入學程度相等，惟此項機關應為大學之一構成部分，抑為單獨設置之高等學府，則各邦之辦法略有差別。在普魯士與巴央兩邦設立兩年制的獨立敎育學院（apdagrgische　Akademie一九三三年改稱師資大學　Hochschnle　　urLehrerbildung），漢堡則將共完全納入大學以內，而為其一構成部分；撒克遜邦之辦法介於兩者之間，學術部分由大學任之，專業陶冶則由單設之敎育硏究所主持，普魯士現制師資大學修業期滿，以「敎職第一試」結束之，通過此項考試者得充「試任敎員」。凡欲獲得永久的任命者，須於任職二年至四年之期間內，應「敎職第二試」。撒克遜師資之訓練期間定為三年，其機關即來比錫大學與杜利斯登工科大學以及特於該二市設置之敎育硏究所；大學方面負責設置學理的科目，而敎育硏究所則從事敎育理論與實踐方面之訓練。</p>

<p>雲南自民國十九年以來、內部比較安定、故各級敎育、頗具規模、若與川黔二省相較、則完善多矣、但滇省各級敎資內容、尚待努力充實、甲·滇省現有雲南大學一所、內設有理工文法二學院、及醫學專修科、因經費年收七萬餘元、故設備甚簡學生亦少、且因交通不便、人才極形缺乏、惟該校校風尚佳、學生畢業出路、則以採礦冶金系學生為最好、乙·中等敎育各校設備尚可、校風亦善、所困難者、惟經費與師資耳、蓋因滇幣價值低落、滇幣一元、僅僅國幣一角、故為中等學校敎員者、雖月有七八百元薪金之收入、若合國幣計算、不過七八十元而已、因此中等學校敎員、多在校外兼事不能以全副精神服務、故滇省中等敎育之發展、尚須努力改進、丙·滇省初等敎育、辦理甚佳、因地方敎育經費、完全獨立、而各縣敎育行政人員亦多負責者、至於義務敎育、滇省在十九年時、曾實施過一次、現中央已補助十七萬元、而省府亦籌撥三十萬元、該省當局對於推行義敎熱忱、誠可敬佩、現規定每縣設十五校或三十班、據余所至各縣、短期小學均已如期開學矣、滇省邊疆及苗民敎育、亦已積極進行、現正籌設省立小學二十餘所、專收苗族子弟、幷設簡易鄉師數所、從事訓練辦理苗民敎育之師資、</p>
<p>總之、川黔滇三省、僻處西南、交通不便、自民元以　、內受封建殘餘勢力之剝削、外受帝國主義之侵略、以致政治黑暗經濟破產、年甚一年、因之敎育亦形衰落、滇省雖比較稍佳、但缺點仍多、去年中央軍到達西南後、三省政治漸趨好轉、當局對於敎育亦能在中央指導之下、循序漸進矣、惟處此國難非常嚴重時期、又値一九三六年之到來、川黔滇三省、已成為我民族生存之根據地、吾人應如何發展交通、改善人民生計、使有餘力、從事敎育而後敎育始得言澈底改進、是則有望我中央之切實不斷地指導與川黔滇三省當局及人民之最大努力也、</p>

<h3>世界運動界鱗爪　亞令配克五色輪旗之由來</h3>
<p>世界運動會之旗幟為白底、由靑黑黃綠赤五色輪圈順序連成之、其歷史知者殊鮮、茲述槪要如下、</p>
<p>黑色為阿非利加洲、黃色為亞細亞洲、綠色為歐羅巴洲、靑色為阿美利加洲、赤色為大洋洲（澳洲）、以故五色輪圈、為代表世界五大洲之意、近以猶太人種問題、德國曾一度差別、引起美國之反抗云、</p>
<p>第五屆世界運動會開會於瑞典京城（斯托克霍姆）後兩年、即為歐洲大戰爆發、（一九一四年）當年六月十四日古白丁男爵在巴黎自費發起組織萬國體育協會、當時即製成此五色輪旗五百枚、送各國委員、並於翌日創立二十週年紀念式、正式使用此亞令配克會旗、當時雖在大戰、此旗仍飄揚於美國落機山市政廳上也、</p>
<p>自後在第七屆大會、又加以刺繍、每屆開會後、此旗即由該屆開會之所在地保管、今年之柏林會、又將由美之落機山市長轉交於柏林市長焉、</p>
<p>世界最長之滑雪跳躍臺</p>
<p>世界最長之滑雪運動（　　）跳躍臺、已在美國波士頓正式築成、全距離為六百呎、中央為六十呎、經此震躍、即有七十五哩之加速力、滑雪者由最高點六百八十四呎處出發、經過四百九十呎長之跳躍區、更經過二百七十五呎之陸地橋大震躍、皆謂雖係著名之美國第一流選手、此激烈之運動、亦為世界第一冒險事云、聞此臺建築費為二萬金、</p>
<p>新西半拉式足球隊遠征日本</p>
<p>全澳洲大學選拔組織之拉式足球隊、在領隊斯密斯指導之下、已於十二月二十三日由新西蘭出發、遠征日本、一行二十五人、聞內一主將僅二十二歲、身高五呎九吋、體重一六六磅、（此球比賽與身材之大小、至有關係）選手年齡最大者、亦僅二十六歲、此球隊曾加有特別訓練、並獲有最高級之運聯戰法云、</p>
<p>拉式足球、即我國所謂橄欖球、乃近今日本各大學冬季運動最盛行之球戲、現東京各大學隊除參加聯盟比賽外、皆在加緊訓練、以備抗此强敵也、（此種橄欖球有所謂拉式與阿式、阿式盛行於美邦、拉式盛時於英國、規則上下無幾、）</p>
<p>英國招請棒球大王羅斯</p>
<p>目今世界棒球之熱盛者、首推美日兩國、惟近年歐洲、各國提倡不遺餘力、顯見猛烈之進步、在英國已見有職業棒球之風起、則該球之普遍現象、亦可見一斑、現倫敦諸棒球團體、擬增進玩藝及一般趣味起見、已在計劃招聘美國棒球大王倍倍羅斯前往、此事倫敦諸薪興職業球團、已在開始與美方接洽、聞此次倍倍羅斯渡英之條件、在彼出場指導比賽之報酬、與彼夫婦兩人之旅費、當顯見相當之巨額、但英方决不以此為憂、並設立棒球學校、請倍倍羅斯擔任講師等之計畫云、</p>
<p>日本組織第十二屆世界運動會籌備會</p>
<p>一九四〇年之第十二屆亞令配克會、將由日本招致、此消息已為一般之認識、此誠為日本宣傳工作之一大收獲也、於此更可見日本之用心於國際之事業、可謂拔全國朝野之力、以驅應矣、日方自得此項可能消息後、即組織招度第十二屆世界運動會籌備會在第一次會議於首相官邸、曾聘請全國體界聞人六十餘人、共同商討、各報亦致力宣傳、在十二月月初我國王正廷氏在東京時、亦曾由體育協會會長、以聯絡國際體育邦交、設席招待、並談及此事、王氏並表示極願將來在柏林會上樂於投同情票云、此雖為過去之閒話、亦可見彼等之重視於此舉動焉、茲錄彼籌備會最近形勢如下、</p>
<p>日方已决定東京神宮外苑中心、為大會會場、已在設計改造、約容十三萬人之大運動場、</p>
<p>游泳池即在現有之神宮原址、加以改造、</p>
<p>帆艇賽定在橫濱附近、漕艇地點尚在研究中、未决定、</p>
<p>拳鬥摔角等室內運動場、亦將於一九四零年前完全、地點在東京神田駿河臺上、</p>
<p>亞令配克村大體在多摩方面、</p>
<p>冬季競技場或在札幌、當在研究中、於今年二月决定、</p>
<p>總設備費為七百萬元、大會經費為一千萬元之預算、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（四）（四）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「現在，我的孩子，給我一個誠實的答語。你拿了那個錢沒有？」</p>
<p>「先生，我沒有！」乃德說了，以一種懇求的顏色仰視着他。</p>
<p>當那幾個字從戰慄的口唇落下來的時候，有人做着咝　的聲音。</p>
<p>「停止！」裴先生喊道，同時重擊着他的桌子，以嚴厲的目光向那聲音來處望着。</p>
<p>那邊坐着內達，解客和愛彌。內達和解客聽了就顯出不好意思模樣，愛彌却喊道：</p>
<p>「這不是我做的，姑丈！一個人跌下去還要去打他，我眞要羞死了。」</p>
<p>「好漢的心腸！」　摩喊道，他想到他的那塊不幸的洋錢生了這許多的是非，心裏也十分苦惱。</p>
<p>「大家靜！」裴先生命令道；等到大家靜下來了以後，他鄭重說道：</p>
<p>「我眞難過，乃德，不過許多證據都對你不利，你舊時的錯處又使我們容易疑心你，比起有幾個從不說謊的童子來，你今天是吃虧了。可是，孩子，你須記住，這一次的偷竊我並不說定是你做的；我非十分確切知道以後我不來罰你的，同時也不願再問這件事。我讓你和你的良心去决定好了。假如這是你犯的，隨便什麽時候，無論日夜，你可到這裏來認過，我會饒恕你，會帮助你補過的。假如你是無關的，這也是遲早總會知道的，一發見以後，我便立時要先向你謝罪，幷且要竭力向大家為你洗刷。」</p>

<h3>紗花　三品紗午後突跌　紗市欲漲又遭挫折</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、形勢益覺　弱不振、蓋以海外花紗狀况、一致傾向下游、大阪三品紗跌風尤熾、人心轉挫、午後市盤驟然下降、因長豐多頭突來了結、以致檯面鬆懈、惟現紗銷路漸形發展、湘粤滇諸帮採辦甚殷云、</p>
<p>標紗近漲速跌</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、市氣異常渙散、一片散漫無勁之狀、本月份竟拍空盤、拍至遠月、微見上升、但成交殊鮮、二盤以後、聞現紗銷塲起色、湘粤兩帮購辦尤旺、人心略振結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二·四·六角、惟六月期四盤全無拍開、均係黑板、足見交易之沉寂矣、午後開盤市勢帶挺、各月上漲三四角、因現紗生意活動、滇帮進胃亦展、查各方成交在二千二百包以外、料詎拍至三收盤、市價忽然轉挫、因大阪三品紗狂跌二三元、長豐多頭出籠、檯面稍鬆、即下墜、結果各月比上日收盤均跌五六角至一元一角、查賣出大孚四百五十包、賡豐一千包、長豐二千一百五十包、大豐四百五十包、潤康二百五十包、永昌二百包、明德二百包、長餘二百包、買進裕大三百包、大興二百五十包、泰昌五百五十包、同和三百五十包、通記六百包、泰興四百包、義成四百包、信誠五百包、一日間最高低及盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷二千餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路暢健、查全日各帮買去統計二千二百六十包、行情與上日無異各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>棉市收盤跌風亦熾</h3>
<p>棉市趨疲、因美棉疲弱無勁、印棉操業者大批賣出、跌勢益盛、而標金平定、人心愈見怠懈、現棉消費頗形沉悶、且交割時期提早二十日舉行、所以近期生意較為熱鬧云、</p>
<p>鄭標長和出籠</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月微見下降、因美棉暗澹無生氣、印棉跌勢又熾、塲中交易極形寥落、市情頗平、結果各月比上日收盤價跌五分至二角、午後開盤聞現紗消費良好、標金堅定、買氣稍激而漲一角半、但長和金業帮乘漲時又來出檔、大阪三品花猛跌六七角、三收盤忽然下挫、且跌風又熾、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二角半至三角、查賣出達記六百担、明德五百担、愼昌一千三百担、愼記七百担、永昌五百担、益康九百担、長餘一千担、長和六千一百担、買進源大五百担、大豐五百担、同豐六百担、元一八百担、益昶一千九百担、永大一千八百担、信誠三千四百担、同興七百担、源興昌五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>棉銷平常</p>
<p>現棉消費平庸、廠胃不爽、來源姚花五百担、通花八百二十包、</p>
<p>去年十二月中旬　華日紗出口統計</p>
<p>十二月中旬上海華日紗出口量總計一萬三千九百九十二包、其中華紗出口量為一萬〇五百九十八包、比上旬八千四百五十七包、增二千一百四十五包、日紗出口量為三千三百九十四包、比上旬之三千八百下七包、减少五百〇三包、茲將運往各地及包額如下、（單位包）</p>
<p>奧姆辣花减收　上週印棉市見堅挺</p>
<p>上週棉市堅挺、半因奧姆辣花减收、半因操業者樂觀所致、國外實需、未見進步、歐洲僅買小量加拉齊花、孟買方面、全不注意、中國呆滯、日本輸出、亦難滿意、印度廠家略有補充存底之意、眞實之消費需要仍缺、附錄上週統計如左、（單位千包）</p>
<p>印紗比較微軟</p>
<h3>糧食　遠期新紛獨漲四分半</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、交易旣甚淸淡、價亦上落無幾、本月份因客戶稍進、微見好面、二四月份則多頭了結、微落半分之譜、六月份新粉、以出戶甚稀、廠方不動、故好起一分外、迫至下午開盤、交易稍形起色、價亦回漲二三分、因目下籌碼枯寂、買戶一動、即易堅挺、如廠家一出、則下挫亦烈、觀上下市成交祗廿五萬幾千包、可知收束時期、當少發展云、</p>
<p>期麥買賣兩寂</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤、各月份殊形寂寞、良因洋麥報價、祗有一角之出入、業內外之交易、均因總結賬之故、無心買賣、且市上籌碼、愈見稀薄、致呈賣買兩寂之境、往後之新賣買、當見更少、故市面甚少進展之勢、各月份收價、大致與前週相仿、現麥交易、亦見沉寂、統市祗零星成交二三百包、價開九角至九角一分云、</p>
<p>洋麥得粉銷支持</p>
<p>海外小麥、美國潛在的麵粉需要、與全球小麥之統計地位、皆足使價格支持不墜、</p>
<p>杜米客秈銷路均活</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源共到四十餘號、（貨共八千餘石）、本街銷場頗活、故市色轉佳、若厚早等粳價升起一二角、薄稻包胃亦旺、計去有四五千包、薄稻行情亦見增高、計高料加五分、中市貨好八分、杜尖同升角許、洋尖乏貨、除變元貨稀、市勢俏色、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源略稀、約有三十餘號、市上白粳去路店銷依然動化、囤戶稍取、價緊一二角、早稻跟緊近角、薄稻亦帶緊勢、羊尖零胃續化、價略轉緊、白元零拆頗活、價加角外、客尖挺立、其餘各貨價、亦見緊勢、</p>
<p>（客秈）來源仍旺、存底亦充、形勢本月逐步趨落之象、惟昨日本街消化特旺、閘北行家進胃尤貪、人心向上、市氣活潑、高次各檔一律跳漲一角左右、全日開出贛米六千包、溫台米五千六百五十包、甬米六百八十五包、湘米二百包、沙市糙五百包、總計達一萬三千包以上、盡由本街辦去、目下本胃尚濃、今後去化再旺、則市價尚有步升之期望云、</p>
<h3>黃豆趨勢仍平穩</h3>
<p>黃豆依然平穩、昨開正陽關豆二車、價為四元六角至五角半、蘭封豆二百包、價為四元六角半、均由廠家辦去、其餘杜沙黃乍豆　豆以上中開貨居優、去路浙省南洋本街等尚能蟬聯、芝蔴洋荘貨訂二月份交貨買方吃十一元七角半、因售出乏人、致尚未成交、以標準連日上漲之軟、</p>
<h3>絲茶　乾繭缺乏絲價暗漲　假期中漲起五十元</h3>
<p>絲市在新年休假期中、暗漲五十元左右、誠出人意外、昨日滬埠雖無交易、然市氣頗稱俏利、蓋尚未停工之絲廠、現亦各繭荒、一般絲商咸高抬價、絲市又入淸堅之途、現白廠絲暗盤B字等級七八均度二〇·二二條份者價八百四十元、八三均度價九百元、一三·一五之　跳舞等級價九百五十元云、</p>
<h3>五金　新鐵絲靜極思動</h3>
<p>新鐵絲新近靜極思動、如福州溫州諸帮、均爭先收辦、成交達六七十桶之多、行情以年關迫近、同業急於求欵、所以比前鬆動、如中檔花色每擔估下四元、苟大批及現欵買賣、行情尚可低廉、細花色則開十六元五六角、亦比前便宜四五角、查目下市存現貨尚有二三百桶之譜、所以行情一節、一時不易回好、</p>
<h3>油市　總結賬前之白桐油　交易日趨岑寂：市價無甚參差</h3>
<p>白桐油因連日封關、故漢市各洋行亦停止辦貨、去年歲底收盤計每担五十一元洋規、今年開盤仍為五十一元、惟常德市面已由四十一元二角加至四十二元五角、致漢市亦稍見緊俏、但各地總結賬之期已近、各圖結束、恐交易日趨岑寂、大槪均在理辦前拋本月份之期油居多、所以現油交易都屬十噸之少數、市面縱俏亦屬紓綏、無激漲之可能、須待結賬後方有開始發展之望也、本埠洋行雖時有交易、但數更少、故專營出口之號家、存積亦不過多、遇有數十噸生意、須要數家合做、蓋所賴於挹注之浙省來源、亦無大宗可以運到、不能若漢市之旺產旺銷也、浙省足度貨聞每砠在四十七八元光景、惟聞前拋本埠號家之期貨、恐年內未必解淸、拋貨之不能如期交到、亦積習使然也、</p>
<h3>糖市　新潮靑降四五角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、依然平疲、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌二十二元半、轉口貨七元二角、均未成交、東赤及八東白均叫原價、本廠綿白振記一號一十一元半、二三四五號照退、號盤有潮帮前日開出新潮靑高下扯價九元八角、計七百餘包、昨又開二百餘包、計提荘靑十元四角、黃崗靑十元、次至九元八角、西靑仝價、比降四五角、又開出普通枝洋白數十包、十四元七角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　馬褲呢旺銷續漲</h3>
<p>馬褲呢實銷仍旺、大新街一帶裁銷尤盛、本埠各西服店亦續有配剪、其走銷駕於大衣料及人字呢之上、售價因存貨缺乏、且國貨出品不繼、又以馬褲呢春季亦為當令旺銷、致賣方特別樂觀而扳漲、市氣大有登峯造極之勢、昨孔士一百號每現售八元五角、老一〇〇五售七元七八角、新一〇〇五售七元、普通二號貨俱售五元六七角、國貨章華馬褲呢門售均為六元、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （倪尙龍）</p>
<p>新年有什麽可賀，快樂呢！，每一個人過一個新年反而在生命綫上短了一截。要是想到人生能有多少新年過，而在過去的年裏會成功了多少事業，不免令人反要戚嘆起來！</p>
<p>新的諧音就是「醒」，所以新年就是醒年；那麽沈醉在嫖賭中的朋友，該是醒的時候，從今後立志懺悔，再排定程序，洗心革面，做一個十足的好國民。</p>
<p>新年裏的日子是浪費的日子，人們袋裏的金錢在滾來滾去，但是朋友們啊！切莫忘記數千萬的災民，他們在冰天雪地裏無衣無食，奄奄待斃！你們新年裏一天所浪費的金錢，足够活不少災民的命啊！</p>
<p>每一個人過一個新年，心裏總有一個滿美的希望產生，然而往往沒有毅力而徒有希望，到了他日事過境遷，情形依然如舊，到底還只留着失望的創痕。</p>
<h3>迎合摩登</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>婦女的旗袍，長，短，寬，窄，高領，低領，長袖，短袖，高跨，低跨，長身筒，短身筒，……在這十年中，已翻了數不淸的花式兒，於是大家都皺了眉說，這麼的一年四季變花樣，赤了脚都跟不上。其實這年頭兒，甚麽東西不在那裏變花樣？不過旗袍的式樣兒，是比別樣東西，變得更快一些兒罷了。</p>
<p>譬如說罷，在街上東衝西撞的汽車，一九三二年，是流行着高個子的立體式的。一九三三年，是流行着榻鼻頭式的。一九三四年，是流行着大屁股式的。一九三五年，是流行着流錢型的。不知一九三六年，又將如何？</p>
<p>再如建築一項，由敎堂式而變為西班牙式而變為立體式，由立體式而變為少見柱子的美國海濱別墅式，再由這一式而變成流錢型，幾乎每年都有新花樣兒玩出來。因建築物的不絕變花樣，於是屋子裏的傢俱，也不絕地跟着變。在傢俱店裏，立體式的，流綫型的，痴肥臃腫，一大疊抽斗到地的，瘦骨稜稜，四根瘦腿，支着全身的，各式全備。但在櫥窗中陳列着的，却都是些小巧玲瓏，而構造十分簡單的。我於是乎知道小型的是一九三五或是一九三六式。</p>
<p>電影一事，這些年來，也在不絕地轉變。偵探片，滑稽片，神怪片，愛情片，哀情片，艷情片，戰事片，探險片，以及專事描寫羅馬宮庭，沙皇故事的歷史片，各佔據着一個相當時期的地位。而同時，我國的文藝界，也是不絕地在桐城派，飲冰室派，四六句派，新靑年派，鴛鴦蝴蝶派，革命文學派，幽默派，小品文派，大衆語派的路上打着轉，文人們不住地把筆尖兒變着花樣。</p>
<p>不錯，靜止，就是不進步。地球是不絕地前進的，地球上的一切，自然也不容作惰性的靜止的。儘着變罷，不耍做一個時代的落伍者。</p>
<h3>求人不如求己</h3>
<h3>柳亞子維也納下海記</h3>
<p>— 豐干</p>
<p>詩人柳亞子，蒿目時艱，灰心國事，皈依曾今可氏「打打麻將」久矣。偶爾涉足舞塲，却無勇氣下海。一九三五年大除夕，赴上海通社讌集於同興樓，與李大超·朱鳳蔚·黃寄萍·黃天鵬諸君曁徐蔚南夫人轟飲，不覺沉醉，遂至維也納，請李麗珍女士為導師，大拖其黃包車，至一十五次之多，見者謂詩人技術雖不高明，然其革命硬幹之精神，却深堪敬佩云，謂余不信，有詞為證：</p>
<p>（金縷曲）　五十居然叟。嘆平生百無一可，知非時侯。新學甚深微妙法，（定厂句）粉膩脂香不朽。笑鬱勃雲情依舊，恒舞酣歌吾輩事，看江山輕付纖兒手。滿腔血，總孤負。祝宗祈死頻年久，慚愧殺吳中名士。少微犯後，入抱溫馨憐楚細，難遣橫胸星斗，揾紅淚羅巾痕繡，莫道逢塲渾作戲，怕侯生輸與香君壽。忍醉我，新亭酒。（却酬）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>賈多才道：難道他敢覇佔人家的妻室不成？他若不把人送回來，我要請小西天裏面的客人出來，和他講一講這個理。茶房回頭看看窗戶外，就走近了一步，低聲道：你是我們的好客人，你老待我們茶房也很好，我們不能不顧着你。那藍夫人就因為前天得罪了全館店的人，今天故意這樣做女俠客，多這一回事。我聽聽這些客人的口氣，大概都說藍夫人做得不錯。你若是和他講理，恐怕你不見得會贏吧？賈多才定了一定神，將下巴直藏到懷裏去，忽然把頭昂了起來，向茶房望着道：他們那些女流……茶房急得只將兩隻手亂搖，輕輕的道：賈先生，你可不能這樣亂說，他們的消息，靈通得很，不到半個鐘頭，他們就全知道了。賈多才道：他們也不是梁山寨上下來的，他們要是胡來，我就到法院裏去吿他們。茶房笑道：他們早就料到了你有這麽一層，那藍夫人已經說了，你若是吿狀，他就去當你的被吿。你以為他們還怕事嗎？賈多才將桌子一拍道：混蛋！你小看了你老爺了。你老爺什麽大塲面都看過，到了西安來，我會在陽溝裏翻了船嗎？誰吿訴你的主意，敎你用這些大話來嚇我。混蛋！混蛋！茶房一番好意，却不料引得他這樣大駡起來，只得將身子向後連述退了兩步，直退到房門口去。賈多才又拍桌子道：還有什麽話，你只管說出來，老爺全不含糊。哼！我若是拿出手段來，敎你們認得我。他雖是把話來駡茶房的，可是揚了臉朝着窗子，直把這話，隔了玻璃窗子，送到樓上去。茶房趁他一個不留神，溜到房門外去，看看過廳裏，站了不少的旅客，都喀嘻的笑着，茶房伸了一伸舌頭，將頭向前一鑽，鑽到茶房屋子裏去了。（三八八）</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>沒有記事的日記</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>「新年了」！似乎有人在我耳畔這樣低語：</p>
<p>但我睜開眼來向四下應了一周，覺得自己的身體仍舊躺在那間陰黯的亭子間裏；灰色的牆壁，灰色的破床，灰色的傢具，依然是和以前一樣，我並沒有發現那裏有新年的氣象。一舊年和新年究竟有些什麽不同呢」？自己有點不相信似地這樣問着，可是不曾有人答應我，但門外孩子們的喀笑，和摜砲聲却冲破了我的懷疑。</p>
<p>「又是一年」！悄悄地站在窗前，想起自己又大了一歲；於是，我的心就沉重了起來。覺得我前幾天還年輕，而如今却老了。因為相隔雖祇幾天，但是却又不得不承認自己已經增加了一歲年紀！</p>
<p>流浪的日子過得眞快，在這里，我又已度過了一個年頭。然而回顧到過去的一年，自己眞如做了一場大夢，而且這夢是這樣地悠長的。</p>
<p>我不能再想我的過去，因為我過去沒有做過好笑的夢。我也不願想現在，因為我現在不會有平靜的生活。我更不敢去想我的將來，因為我於將來也不曾有過美麗的希望。那麼長，那麽遠的過程，只是在悲哀和血淚中度過來的。現在，自己已是一個給環境鬥敗了的戰士，負着重創，從陣上逃了回來，躺在沒有人跡的荒野裏呻吟了。可是，這呻吟的聲音也不敢放得怎樣高；恐怕給我的敵人聽到了，走過來給我一刺刀。然而，我也不願意有人來把我救去，只希望自己就這樣寂寞地死去，甚至連世界上一個人都不曉得我怎樣死去的消息！</p>
<p>為了自己不會像別的人們一樣，願意去做環境的俘虜和生活的奴隸，讓自己的靈魂去零碎出賣，受盡那冷酷的蹂躪與摧殘的苦痛，所以終於負着重傷逃到了這裏來。</p>
<p>在從前，我也曾勇敢地奮鬥過不少次，　　的歌聲和雄壯的吶喊也的確曾經　　　　　　年的心靈，使他們漸漸地從麻木中　　　。　時，自家也頗覺得有點兒自豪：</p>
<p>「我很年靑，我有毅力，只要奮鬥，不怕　牆鐵壁，一定會給我打出一條出路萊」。自已說着挺挺胸脯，彷彿就成了一名廳勇的戰士。</p>
<p>但，靑年會在生命中消失的，毅力會給生活破壞的，勇敢也終於變了頹廢；如今，自已只有躺在沒有人到的荒野裏嘆息了。</p>
<p>現在，我怕有人問起我今年幾歲，因為我一提到自己的年齡就要感到悲哀，慚愧！但　能够永遠不再想起它，讓它同我的青　一樣的寂寞地死去。——</p>
<p>默默地，拉上了窗子，走到桌邊，從桌底下舊書堆裹抽出那冊積滿堅埃的日記，翻開來，裏面却寫着這樣幾行：</p>
<p>一月一日：天晴，×××××××</p>
<p>一月二日：上午晴，下午陰，……</p>
<p>一月三日：颶風——</p>
<p>一月四日：晨有濃霧，下午小雨，？？？？</p>
<p>一月五日：雨雪紛飛，！！！！</p>
<p>日記只寫到一月五日為止，幷且都是用符號代替了紀事的，以後全是空白頁紙，沒有着一個字跡。這，我也明白，並不是一年中間沒有可記的事情，也不是自己太忙而連寫日記的工夫都沒有；如果說懶惰而不肯寫，那也是武斷的。其實是因為我的生活委實太悲慘了，所以不忍去記錄它，還是讓它去隨着時光一同地消逝在過去的影子裏吧！</p>
<p>可是，如今忽然重來翻開那冊沒有記事的日記，不禁使一切舊創新痕又復躍然紙上，雖然紙上沒有字，但在我記憶裏却寫得很淸楚，看了這一頁一頁沒有記事的日記，反而比有記事的更刺心，更觸目！</p>
<p>「又是新年了，我今年的日記寫不寫呢」？道樣問着自己，但是沒有回答。</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （懋德）</p>
<p>前天，我偶然經過一個地方，是在潭子口，住戶多半是江北人，用稻草蓋的小茅屋。街道祇有五六尺寬，兩面還放些東西，胖的人走起來的確有些困難。街上時時聞到臭味，大糞缸比茅屋還多，男女到處都可以大小便，我走了幾步，滿鞋都是屎。</p>
<p>這裏的住民多數是兩棲動物，有的以划小船過活，有的在河岸上做工吃飯，他們的生活非常的苦。每一艘小船裏總有五六個人，這五六個人之中有一個是他們全家的家長，其餘的是家長的妻子或子女。船上的划槳，貨物的運卸，都是家長的責任，所以家長也就是他們全家最重要的人物。有一條船，大概因為家長死了，他的妻子伏在船邊上嗚嗚的哭，許多人都集在岸上看，每人臉上都現出慘痛的神色。船內的婦人不住的向衆人祈求；伊的意思就是要我們捐上幾個錢給伊丈夫買棺材，岸上的人們向袋裏去摸的畢竟沒有幾位。</p>
<p>「如其有天堂，這該是地獄了！」回來的時候，我道樣的想着。</p>

<h3>第四次全國醫師代表大會會務報告（下）</h3>
<p>— 徐乃禮</p>
<p>四處理會員團體申請事件經過　是類案件，在此二年中積亦不少，其中有需轉呈上級機關者，有需轉達地方政府者，更有請求解紛釋疑者，茲為便利計，特分類述之如次，</p>
<p>轉呈上級機關者計七件。（甲）杭州醫師公會來文。請轉呈司法行政部·通飭各地法院。辦理有關醫藥案件。儘量聘用醫藥專家。參加探討或陪審·並切實加以科學檢騐一案。曾經上屆第三决執委會議决照轉。旋奉批示。關於醫藥案件。各級法院多依法選任專家鑑定。至於參加陪審制度。現行法令。並無根據。應母庸議。（乙）杭州醫師公會來文。請轉呈立法院從速頒布醫師法及藥師法一案。曾經三屆第九决執委會。議决照轉。雖奉批交法制委員會備査。但迄今未聞有起草是項法令之聲浪。故此後尙須繼續作有效之請求。（丙）鄞縣醫師公會來文。請轉呈內政部令行浙省民廳。轉飭該縣。依助產土條例。嚴厲執行一案。曾經三屆第十二决執委會議决照轉。呈文去後卽蒙批淮。且悉已經見諸事實。（丁）西京醫師公會來文對於敎部醫學敎育委員會所擬醫學課程大綱。有所指駁。請求加以嚴密審査一案。曾經三屆第十四决執委會。議决抄送各會員團體。徵集意見。並推委員五人負責審査。當時收到各地意見書多起。悉經審査委員會審査。結果歸納成要點八條。函送醫敎委員會請其採納。（戊）杭州市醫師公會來文。請轉呈內政部取消該地官廳禁北自由出售來沙而藥水一案。曾經三屆第十五决執委會。議决照轉。後亦已邀准。見諸事實。（己）上海市醫師公會來文。為取締醫藥廣吿文字。呈衛生署。通令各省市遵照醫師暫行條例第十八條認眞辦理外。並請本會一致請求一案。曾經提出三屆十八决執委會討論後。卽具呈衛生署。請其照辦。迨奉批示。悉已核准北平巿衛生局所定之取締規則。通令各地仿照辦理。但査北平市所訂規則原文。廣吿審査並無具體標準。爰經三屆第十九决執委會議决。再行呈請。並附具體辦法。請其採納。嗣又奉批留備採擇。（庚）閩侯醫師公會。為當地稅務局。徵收診所舖捐糾紛。來電請轉呈財政部衛生署豁免一案。當經三屆第二次執監聯席會議議决照轉曾於去年十二月奉財部快郵代電已經糾正矣　（辛）此外尙有無鍚醫師公會為醫用麻醉藥品請轉呈內政部衛生署予以保隙。及吳縣醫師公會為美醫藍文秘方療肺請轉呈衛生署取締各案。亦均照轉。不過結果並無澈底辦法。</p>
<p>轉函地方政府者。如南京醫師公會　馮子鈞誇稱治肺大王。不容於京市　竟復移地招謠．請本會就近函主管官署査禁案。曾分函滬巿衛生社會二局。請共取締。</p>
<p>為會名糾紛來請解决者。如雲南昆明醫師公會。泉州晉江醫師公會籌備會。廣州巿醫師公會。及最近吳縣醫師公食。均經地方黨部令改西醫公會名稱。來文請求解釋。迭經執行委員會提出討論。認為醫師公會名稱。係醫師暫行條例所規定。於理不容兩歧。前曾發生同樣糾紛。先例正多。均經本會力爭有效。故對於各地請求。均本此旨予以答覆。共間如廣州巿醫師公會問題。曾由本會一再函該省省黨部解釋。雖終得貫徹原有主張。然文字間之往返。已大廢時日矣。</p>
<p>其他請求解釋者。如寗鹽醫師公會為檢騐鴉片。於文字上發生疑問。沙巿醫師公會。為地方政府取締未頒部證之醫師。於辦法上發生疑問。鎭江醫師公會為修改章程中會員入會條文。及江陰醫師公會為助產士入會問題。均於資格上發生疑問來文請求解釋悉經執行委員會一一予以答覆。事屬瑣細。故不復詳細報告。</p>
<p>五　處理上級機關委辦事件之經過　此二年中。接受上級機關委託辦理之事件。為數不多。統而計之。不過三件。第一件二十三年九月。衛生署來函為廣東潮安醫師公會呈請解釋會員資格。囑代査核答覆。當經三屆第九次執委會决議。査據歷來各地設立醫師公會之成案照覆。同時並檢同本會各會員團體之現行章程附去。以供參考。第二件。去年三月。衛生署來函。中央為民運指委會。函徵醫師對於病家交付藥方一案。囑加具意見。當經三屆第十四决執委會討論。僉謂世界通例。處方之意義。本為指交配藥者調劑之用。至交付病家與吾。在醫師自有權衡。爰决議卽以此具覆。第三件。去年五月。上海特別巿黨部頒布各團體設立識字學校辦法。限二星期內籌備具報。當卽遵照辦理。並呈准市黨部編為第五十八校。於六月十日開學授課二閱月。雖結果經當局核准畢業者僅十三人然實際獲識字機會者四十餘人。大多數為職業關係。缺席時數過多。不克與考故也。</p>
<p>六處理其他臨時事件之經過</p>
<p>民國二十三年中央頒布嚴禁烈性毒品條件。對於醫用麻醉藥品。並無特別規定。醫藥二界均威不便。先接上海市新藥業同業公會來函。請作一致之主張。後又派員參加上海市醫師公會。藥師公會。製藥廠業同業公會等團體之聯席會議。嗣蒙政府容納各方意見。聞已指定衛生署。檢理醫藥用醉麻藥品授受事宜。想雖實現之期已不在遠。故此案之解决。不過時間問題矣。</p>
<p>此外二年來。疊接廣東，鎭海，及張家口等地公團或私人來函。請為一般適合變通登記辦法而逾期未領部蹬之醫師。代請補給。或請開班補習者亦不少。迭經執委會討論。認為如由地方政府代為主張。或有救濟辦法。故均依此作覆。</p>
<p>至於以私人名義來請解决法律上糾紛者。亦有數起。均經一一答覆。令其先向就近醫師公會申訴。蓋私人請求事件。向例不予受理故也。</p>
<p>七　其他報吿事項</p>
<p>此二年中通過新會員。計有張家口，西京。廣州。　北。欄候。　田等六團體。至於總事務所人事方面。亦略有變更。卽民國二十三年六月。經濟委員牛惠生君。因病請起。曾經三屆六决執委會議决。推夏愼初姜振勛代理。又為整理歷屆大會舊案。於二十三年八月添聘姜振勛君為總幹事。最近常務委員龐京周君出國考察。又經三屆二十一决執委議决。推姜振勛暫代。此外參加別種團體大會者。如中華醫學會第二屆大會在南京舉行。則推褚民誼，胡定安，金鳴宇，陳聞達，四委員參加。第三屆大會在廣州舉行。除推廣州市醫師公會常務委員就近出席外。又推牛惠生委員前往參加。又二十三年雙十節。全國慈幼領袖會議。及二十四年十一月十日全國新藥業公聯合會。均在滬開會。則推徐乃禮委員前往參加。</p>
<h3>病理學的發展（中）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十五—</p>
<p>可是，眞正可被稱為病理學的始祖的，還須推摩爾甘尼（Morgani）吧。摩爾甘尼的觀察比巴尼忒斯精細得多。一七六一年，他的名作「疾病的位置與原因」（De　Cansis　Norborum）出版。這里所記載的，是摩爾甘尼寫給一個靑年學生的連續的信扎；和巴尼忒斯的作品大致相彷，他記錄着一個病人的徵候及死後內部器官的察看。和巴尼忒斯相較，摩爾甘尼是更精細的觀察者和更實際的解剖者。他首先說明Mastoiditis和腦部膿瘡是從生膿的耳病而來的。裴里（Mathow　Baillie）是另外一個偉大的病理學者。地是十九世紀初期的人；他的那本關於病理解剖學的著作是頗著盛名的。</p>
<p>顯微鏡發明的完成，使病理學獲得重要的進步。一種科學的前進倚賴另一種科學的發明：這是常有的事。細胞學說，胚胎學，和微體解剖學，都是從顯微鏡的發明而來的。於是病理學者就依照微髖解剖學的方法，把疾病組織放在顯微鏡下察看，一八五八年，浮周（Rudolph　Virchow）的「細胞病理學」（Celluar　Pathology。這是病理學史中一個劃時代的事件。注意這個名稱吧。這是以細胞及細胞活動為基礎而論述疾病法則的一本作品。這作品和這作者對於醫學思想的影響，是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>依照浮周的見解，身體是「一個細胞，在這裏而每一個細胞都是一個公民。」因此，疾病就是「因外力活動而起的國中公民的衝突」。他發見：病人身體中的細胞和健康者身體中的細胞，木身並無差異，所不同的只在於細胞的活動狀况—列如長成的速度和位置等。「細胞生細胞」（Omnis　cellula　e　cellula），是浮周的偉大的生物學學說。所以，疾病細胞的祖宗一定是正常細胞。</p>
<p>細胞病理學的偉大的價値，在於浮周藉以就各種疾病察看各種組織的空前的透澈。浮周所說關於肺結核大細胞栓塞，癌腫細胞，癌腫易位，心臟實質，狼瘡，血塞，激動的流浪細胞，及其他論題的話，目前仍為認為與現存的病理學家們的意見同樣重要。從浮周的時候熱，病理學者們固然搜集了些新的技術，隨處增補了些零碎東西，但顯微病理學却是在一八五八年—就是浮周出版「細胞病理學」那一年—已完全成熟的。</p>
<p>這些工作樹立了關於疾病的任何正確知識的茶礎。但我們必須記得，非回小可的缺漏還是有的。就解剖所發見的一部分的變化，不能說明病理學的全部。譬如說：患腹部腫脹，發汗，發熱的人，死後給發見肝臟生膿。於是問題就起來了：什麽原因造成了肝臟的膿？原來病理解剖學只是藉以闡發疾病性質的第一步，本身却不能啟示器官變化的原因。又如：生前患水腫而達於昏量的人，死後給發見腎臟腫大，蒼白，有病色。我們便問：腎臟變化怎樣使他昏暈，怎樣使液質積聚在他的組織中？這也是病理解剖學所不能啟示的。這些問題的解答，還須等待浮周以後的許病理學家的硏究。細菌學的進步，植物有機體進入人體後使組織發生變化追學說的發明</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，供給了以前所未知的許多疾病的原因的說明。其他科學！尤其是化學和物理學—的進步，使專門學者得以硏究病體的組織和血液的化學變化。</p>
<p>這樣，今日的「病理學」是不僅包括關於疾病組織的形態的知識（病理解剖學）的，而且是包括關於使組織發生變化的那些煤介物的活動的變化的知識（細菌學，寄生物學，毒物學等），以及關於變化機能，分泌，病體的化學反應的性質的知識（病理生理學）的。</p>
<h3>預防流行性感冒（俗稱傷風）的方法</h3>
<p>— 等原著　陳生白節譯</p>
<p>當冬天光臨，氣候轉變的時候。在各處吾們會發現戚冒的流行。這正像其他傳染病一樣，是多麽可厭的一種病症，允其是關於它的預防，因為下面幾個條件而更比其他傳染病為難。</p>
<p>第一因為吾們還不完全知道它流行的因子，它的原發病原菌和特性。</p>
<p>第二因為本病是經過空氣的傳染。是有無數健康的或輕症的帶菌者。是有突然爆發性的。所以不能够實行一般的傳染病隔離法。</p>
<p>第三因為還缺少像種牛痘的特效的預防接種法。</p>
<p>但是從幾年來為了感冒的大流行而得來的經騐。吾們確信。倘使能够實行相當的預防法。那麽對於發病的數目。和因為威冒而續發的病患。至少有減少的可能的。預防的目標有二。就是傳染預防和發病預防。前者是說怎樣能够使有病的材料不會傳染到健康者的方法。後者是說當旣經感染之後。怎樣才可以不致發病的方法。</p>
<p>（甲）傳染預防法</p>
<p>本病的傳染。是由於有病呼吸道的濕潤分泌物。經過可見看到和不能看到的噴嚏，咳嗽，談話時的吐沫。因為直接和病人接觸的空氣媒介。或者附有新鮮分泌物的病人的手，手巾，帕子的接觸塗抹。而與以感染的機會。至於預防方法又可分為個人的和團體的兩種。</p>
<p>（一）個人傳染預防</p>
<p>從以上事實所吿訴。可以曉得。感冒的預防旣是這樣困難。那麽個人預防法。理應該由官廳制定。用無綫電，報張，傳單的宣示。一方面可以預備各個人的本病的發生。另一方面還可以減少傳染給他人的危險。當然家庭顧問醫生，醫院醫生。也不能忘掉他們對於整個家庭醫院裏人們的健康。有注意於實行個人傳染預防的義務的。下面是幾個忠吿。</p>
<p>子。為了限制吐沫傳染。對於咳嗽，噴嚏，談話有注意的必要。普通距離兩米突的談話。多少可以減少傳染的機會的。</p>
<p>丑。為了限制塗抹傳染。就應該注意於手巾，面巾的淸潔和接吻的禁止。</p>
<p>寅。儘可能範圍內。應該遠避含有傳染性的空氣，咳嗽，談話等的必要。</p>
<p>卯。禁止訪病。也是傳染預防的要圖。就是在不能不訪病的時候（像看護婦等）應該為了預防吐沫的傳染。載用防病口罩。或者內服奎寗（Chininum俗稱金鷄納霜）。</p>
<p>辰。帶一個簡單的防病面罩（像醫生所用的手術口罩的樣子。裏面襯兩三層消毒的紗布）。杜絕吐沫的侵襲。當然也是合理而切當的個人預防法。</p>
<p>已。有的人可以逃避到沒有或者很少流行性感冒的地方。以免除感染的機會。倘使能够並用奎寗內服預防法。那是更其妥當了。至於當流行期的旅行。當然要有考慮的。</p>
<p>（二）團體的傳染預防</p>
<p>吾們知道團體的傳染預防。應該由官廳，醫院，醫生。經過一致的規則。一定的步驟。實行統制的方法。才會達到目的。下面且列舉幾個綱目。</p>
<p>子。宣傳　團體傳染預防的第一步。就是應該向該團體裏宣傳個人預防傳染法。</p>
<p>丑。在相當時期裏。最好要閉鎖學校或遊戲塲。因為這樣。才不使人們有接觸聚集的機會。也就是不使人們有轉輾相傳的機會了。</p>
<p>寅。病人的隔離。更是預防上的要策。在軍隊，學校等團體生活的塲所。應該隨時檢査各個人的健康，隨時做精詳的報吿。</p>
<p>卯。病院戒嚴室的設備。這也就是隔離的意思。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十五）睫毛亂生症</p>
<p>在上下眼臉的邊緣上，生有細毛，就是我們所稱為的睫毛，與眉毛同樣增加面容的美觀，允以女子為然，歐美人的睫毛，比較我國人的睫毛，生得特別長，所以歐美女子的眼部，似乎更覺艷麗，講到睫毛的方向，本來一致向前，毫不接觸眼球，但是如果一旦發生睫毛亂生症，則睫毛的方向，卽可轉變，而由前方改向後方，牠的配置亦不規則，此時睫毛觸及眼球，常致引起眼球的刺戟症狀，發生羞明，流淚及發赤，角膜因有屢被睫毛摩擦，所以角膜的表層，常可發生混濁，有時竟可釀成角膜潰瘍或Pannus　Panuus的意義，就是角膜的上皮，發生肥厚，同時引起血管的新生，在患砂眼的時候最多，）等危險合併症，而患者亦卽感覺視力糢糊，或者竟至失明，亂生的睫毛，普通較健全的為短且粗，或如微細蒼白色的毳毛，亂生的部位，並無一定，有時祗占眼臉緣的一部分，有時可及眼臉緣的全部分，此乃全依亂生的輕重而異，再者睫毛往往可以併生而作前後二列，就中後一列的睫毛，則多向後方，這種病情，特稱之為睫毛重生症，牠的症候則與睫毛亂生症同。</p>
<p>睫毛亂生症的原因，誰有先天性及後天性的兩種，但依臨症上的所見，則概以後天性的為多，後天性的原因中，第一當推砂眼，因為患重症砂眼的時候，結膜及軟骨均發瘢痕的收縮，以致眼臉彎曲，眼臉緣壓迫眼球，患者常常苦於流淚，眼臉隨因一淚液的濕潤，引起糜爛，而睫毛亂生症亦多於此時發生，其他如結膜炎，眼臉緣炎，眼臉的病理新生物及由潰瘍或外傷所引起的瘢痕等等，亦均可引起睫毛亂生症。</p>
<p>睫毛亂生症的預防法，就是速謀排除後天性的原因，譬如患有砂眼，結膜炎，眼臉緣等病的時候，應卽治療，以免惹起本症，本症的治療法，卽在睫毛少數亂生時，可用睫毛鑷子，將亂生睫毛一一拔去，若再反復亂生，則應由眼科醫師施行電氣分解術，以求根治。</p>
<h3>防癆聲中吾人對於肺癆應有之認識（下）</h3>
<p>— 鍾志和</p>
<p>（已）公衆衛生　　改良學校工廠等處衛生上之設備，　檢査食物如牛乳等，　普及通俗衛生敎育，使一般入了解肺癆病之可怖，但從早療治，並非無治療之希望，　創立防癆院，强迫隔離，（由政府通令施行之）　設立防癆診療所，免費檢騐體格，並愛克司光檢査，　興辦健康保險，　贊助防痰會，予物質及精神上之援助（農工商學兵與政府通力合作，始能奏效，）　由衛生行政機關派醫師護士及衛生警察，按戶調査有無肺癆病人或疑似者，有之當立卽送入防癆院，　廚子患咳者當送防癆院，以免傳佈疾病，是為至要，（曾見某菜館廚子二人患肺癆，以之調烹，其危險豈非大哉，）</p>
<p>療治</p>
<p>輓近療治肺癆其網要注重於六項原則，苟病人能恒久忍耐，勇於合作，謹愼恪守，無稍忽懈，疾患之日趨於進步，漸入佳境，當可必也，茲分陳於下，（甲）絕對之休息肺癆患者，據近代醫學之研究，首重休息，其理由有四，　休息可以滅身體之消耗，　使血液循環緩慢，則結核桿菌無機可以蔓延，其毒素不致散佈全身，　减低血壓，可以防止咳血，　减低熱度，以及防止病窺之擴大，使損害處有結瘢疤之機會也。</p>
<p>（乙）豐富之營養肺癆病人消耗旣鉅，倘不設法補救之，則全身狀况愈趨愈下，將有不堪設想之危機，今擇營養覺富之食物，投予病人，使其體重日增，有補於病體之復原，其關係甚重大焉，然須注意下列之事項，　攝取易於消化之食物，如牛乳每日最佳服一磅，鷄蛋每日食二至六只，餘如蔬朵水果牛肉肝臟等，均須分配食之，　廢止一切兩餐問之零星食物，食當有節制，　一日三餐，宜有定時，每餐至少須隔四小時，　食宜細嚼，不可狼呑虎嚥，　食前後不宜運動或用腦，抑鬱時不可進食，　注意其消化力。</p>
<p>（丙）新鮮空氣和日光　結核桿菌嫌氧氣畏日光，故患者當居新鮮空氣之地，日光內富含紫外光綫，其有殺菌力，故病人之居室或臥室，宜多見日光，但直接之照射，病人每易激增體溫，並誘起咳血，不可輕易嘗試之為要。</p>
<p>（丁）適當之敎育令病人明了該病之原因症狀，以及預防療治之原理，與醫者相互合作，於之病預防，大有裨益焉。</p>
<p>（戊）精練之外科近代醫學進步，除內科療法外，可施用外科療法，以治肺癆，按病情之不同，以及病人體力之各異，分別適應治療之方法，　人工氣胸術，Artifical　Pneumothorax　胸廓成形術，Thoracoplasty　膈神經切斷術，Phrenicectowy油胸術，Qleo-thorax</p>
<p>（己）正當之藥物在正式醫師指導下，服正當可靠之藥物，以為補助，倘不察內容，見報端誇大之宣傳成藥，或奸商秘製之藥物，內多含麻醉劑，切忌內服，吾則日久癮成，反有害於病體，不可不審愼選擇，藥物中用以療治肺癆者，概括之有下列數種，　鈣鹽類製劑，無論注射或內服，能增加血液中鈣質之含量，對於肺部損害有助其組成石灰化，將病灶包圍起結疤現象，且對於咳血者能奏止血之效，此種製劑種類極多，尋常每多與葡萄糖混合，製成注射藥液或藥片，　魚肝油，雖可列入食物中，然多半之魚肝油內含碘燐等質，服之除能令人肥胖，增加體重外，因其富含維他命丁Aitamin-D對入體鈣質之新陳代謝大有佐助之功，輓近除鱉魚肝油Cod　Livei　Oil外，新出之比目魚肝油，Halibut　liver　oil　功能更强病人，服之極佳，　木焦油Cressate及共類似之製劑，對肺部有殺菌作用，服之能將肺部複雜之情形减少，而併發症或後發病亦因之遞减也，　肝臟製劑，內服或注射，功能補血，而肺癆忠者大都有貧血，以之療治，效亦不淺，　止咳化痰藥，以不含麻醉劑者為妥，不得已而須含有麻醉劑者，當遵醫師之勸導及監督，而善為施用之其他藥物種類繁多，倘一知半解，藥石妄投，其危險眞無窮也，愼之戒之。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（十五）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第八四問）慢性牙根膜炎怎樣形成的？</p>
<p>（答）急性症候消失後，常因牙根管沒有根治，膿毒猶存，或因牙床骨內　孽未淸，以致膿液常流。又膿菌常會潛藏於一個堅靭的小囊袋內，未易為藥力所剷　、患牙拔出後，附着於牙脚　的卽是，不知者往往誤認為附速的牙肉，其實就是慢性牙根膜炎病原。這病也可叫做慢性齒槽膿瘡（Chronic　Alveolar　Abscess）</p>
<p>（第八五問）慢性牙根膜炎的病象怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）常有小量膿液，從牙根管中流出。或造成一膿管，在靠近患牙根端部牙肉處流出。患牙稍覺酸軟浮動，顏色暗晦。患部牙肉深紅。然患者因為不感到若何苦楚，多不去注意牠，甚至不知道病的存在和膿汁的流出。但若膿路被阻，或骨部炎症復發，則一切病狀，又會變劇。又如身禮虛弱時，亦有回復急性的可能。</p>
<p>（第八六問）慢性牙根膜炎能够發生什麽危險？</p>
<p>（答）牠每日所釀成的膿液，其毒素或直接吸收，或因膿汁之嚥下在胃腸吸收。日積月累，常能引起全身各種疾病：如胃腸病，關節炎，肺病，眼病，腦病等。患者多不自知其病源在於口腔，往往捨本治標，久不見愈。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>共同防俄？</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>日外相將向我國提議，，依據向我國所提出之所謂「中日關係基礎」「三點政策」第三節，向蘇俄要求開放外蒙古，以容許其他外國，如蘇俄拒絕，卽成立所謂「中日軍事同盟」，以共同抵制蘇俄將外蒙蘇俄化。日外相謂：今華北問題已吿滿意解决（！）外蒙古奉蘇俄訓令，在政治上經濟上社會上與世界隔絕，故中日應共同向蘇俄要求開放。日本對華北問題，旣認已圓滿解决，外蒙自然成了它進一步進攻的目標。</p>
<p>「九一八」以來，日本總是掮着「反蘇」的招牌，遮掩了列强自私的眼，而在暗中大規模割取中國土地。這已是談論國際問題者的常識。現在日本又在抄老文章。其實它的眞正目標，是在中國北部接近外蒙的大部土地，自察哈爾。綏遠·寗夏·陝西以至新疆一帶，都在它繼續佔取的計劃中。這才是它本心所在，佔取蒙古尙在其次（自然，反蘇任務，它並未放鬆，不過目前蘇聯在遠東的和平力量尙超過日本的戰爭力量時，日本不願冒險先動而已，進攻蘇聯，是其最終目的，侵華為其初步）。現在華北旣已吿滿意解决，自然，中國整個黃河以北的土地，也非順序地被「滿意解决」不可。而這解决的藥方，便是「中日共同反俄」！</p>
<p>就常識而論，一個國家應「防禦」的，是正在向它邁步侵入的侵略國。共同反俄，現在是俄國在向我國進行激急的侵略呢？還是其他的國家？如說中國要防禦外國的話，那首先便是要抵禦正在向我激急侵入的國家！這正所謂「三尺童子，皆能知之」。說要和正在向我激急侵入的國家「提携」。「親善」。甚至「同盟」起來，向另一個並未向我侵略的國家去攻擊它，這結果是什麽？將是被提携者，被親善者，被同盟者，完全變成了我們的提携者親善者同盟者脚下的保護國！决沒有別的！然後驅使被同盟國家的人民，代做砲灰，去進攻主動同盟者所要進攻的國家。共同反俄的內容，原來如此！</p>
<h3>火</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>十二月的夜，像一面荒凉的郊原躺在黯淡的天體下，天上沒有星，也沒有月亮，雖然也還沒有降雪，而尖力子一樣的北風却在虎虎地刮着，行人是稀落得寥寥可數的？　　遠處有夜販的呌賣聲走過，一面篤篤地敲着梆子，凄慘的意味加濃着。大街盡頭那一站，排列着密密的高低不齊的草棚屋舍，屋簷互相緊挨着。無家可歸的流浪人，甲蟲似的拘着身，蜷縮着，在路旁拾取草梗紙球，花生殼的燃料物，三五個圍攏到那家蓬棚屋子門前，把拾來的東西扔在一堆，擦根火柴點着，於是那些東西燒着了，緩緩的燒旺起來，紅熊熊的火燄一陣一陣往上升，往上升。一夥兒擠在一塊，噓着氣鼻子的水一滴滴流下來，伸出凍殭的手拚命撫摩烤着。</p>
<p>為了天冷，高個子的巡捕也不知躲到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>火，火，火，燃着，再找些東西添上去，火更加狂盛了。火於是捲到蓬棚上面去了。蓬棚着火了。</p>
<p>闖禍，一個直覺的恐怖。流浪人全一溜煙逃沒。</p>
<p>很快很快地，火掠着草棚一家一家爬過去。等到屋子里的人發覺，跑出來，自已的草棚的家已經陷在烘烘的火窟當中了。</p>
<p>滔天的紅色的火花瀰漫了整個空間。</p>
<p>在火光的照射下：人聲騷亂着，足步慌張着。壯漢子眯着睡服奔出來，走到外面才想起掉下誰在火堆里，於是衝拖出個炙焦了腦袋的小子來，也有穿着單衫手裏抓着什麼東西在跳來跳去，也有年老的婦人跌在路旁半昏地吐着唾涎，也有小孩子找不着老子的。娘兒找不着女兒的。</p>
<p>一片嘈雜的啼哭混和着號啕的吶喊。混和着水龍機的橡皮管嘩嘩啦啦的噴水聲浪。</p>
<p>觀火景的人站滿了大街的兩旁。自由卡車，來了一大隊，印度阿三抓着皮一鞭子，雄糾糾的飛奔着，抽打着人的身子，把他們趕到遠處去。　　　　北風刮得越有勁，火勢也不稍熄，借着風的煽動，它是更加得意向草棚的地方拖過去，無限度的蔓延着。</p>
<p>戴着銅帽子的救火員，拿着長鋤子，追着它趕上前面把沒着火的屋子毀掉，攔阻它的去路。可是一陣狂大的風送來，助長了它的勢頭，它便可騰空滾上去。畢畢拍拍燒着了。</p>
<p>慘呌呼號的聲音隨着新燃的火，重行混雜地充滿了人們的耳際。響着尖銳）的銅鈴的紅十字救護車最忙碌，着開了空車子來，載了一車子被火砲烙過的人去。</p>
<p>大街的水河流似的泛濫着。</p>
<p>風略小，火燄也略略疲倦下來。在陰冷凄鬱的夜色下，那許多草棚的房子是變成一片七零八落的焦土了，於是悲絕的哭嚷又開始着　　　在陰冷凄鬱的夜色下，家毀了，兒子不見了，是葬在火山里吧，老婆不見了，是運到紅十字，受了傷重吧，自已也不知道的。可是有人發見從火堆拚死搬出來的什麼箱子，在凌亂中，呌火鳥兒吊去了。</p>
<p>家是沒有了。暫且在十二月的街角橫它一夜。但明天去到什麽地方呢？</p>
<h3>女神</h3>
<p>— 江　作</p>
<p>「叛逆徒！你們想往那兒逃跑？天誅快了，天子的神軍就要趕到。」顓頊的面上帶着得意的獰笑，高舉着血淋淋的銅刀，像瘋狗似的狂呌，率領了他的黨徒，向那不周山狂奔。（十七）</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>明天看著碎亂塊和灰燼的家，又從灰燼裏掘出一些燒爛的模糊的屍身，認認看，並不清楚，而自己是短少了誰，也許就是自己的兒女，自己的親人很也許就是那個隣家吧。</p>
<p>於是這里各自散去了，茫茫的人海里又多了一批不幸的人。</p>
<h3>「老頭」店</h3>
<p>— 唐雯</p>
<p>是十二月下旬，天上漆黑一片，山頂上狂風吼着，那些枯禿的樹枝就仿佛鬼魅一樣發出尖銳的呼聲，山道里沒有一個夜行人，間或有一二聲犬吠衝破這寂寞的空間。山脚下有一盞摇幌着的燈光，是這里招商客寓的門燈。店主人是個善於行商的老頭，帶着一個不很聰敏的伙計在這深山里開這招商客寓；因爲這山道是往來省城與泰安之間的要道，終年有行商的旅隊從這里經過，他就扼住這要口做筆穩賺錢的賣買。省城與泰安幹行脚的都知道這老頭兒。有時從省城批了貨物到泰安去做賣買，或是從泰安收集了農作物上省城去貨，在路上沒有餘錢，老頭兒總是和柔地答應客商的要求，在水牌上暫時宕筆帳，到賣了貨回路的時候歸還，所以帮口上有「住老頭」的一句行話，意思就是上老頭兒的招商客寓過宿。</p>
<p>「老頭」的賣買每天有兩個刻板的時候：一個中午時分的打尖，一個太陽下山時的過宿，因為這山道適是省城與泰安的半途。如果早上出發，午時到老頭店里打類，晚上到達目的地。午後出發就要在老頭店裏過宿了。到了陰曆年底，這山道上往來的商隊更多，收賑的，辦貨的都幹着年底結束，老頭每天清早督促那小伙計宰猪煮菜，太陽剛剛打中，他啣着旱烟袋踱到門前來，向兩頭探望着，見有驢車，幹脚的影子，他高舉起旱烟袋來打招呼，有時高興起來跑上三頭二百步去迎接他的主顧。年底的主顧都是富翁，放了畜　之後，就喊着肉啊酒啊要餐一個飽的。老頭有數十年做招商客寓的經驗，他奏養幾頭猪，釀幾甕酒，都是預備應付年底的生意的。平時那時做生意人同樣精明，一碟鹹菜過三大碗白飯，喝一兩白水酒的已是上好的主顧了。在年底，就不論做大賣買的，幹行脚的，放畜口的，腰板里藏着的是錢，辛苦了一年的生意人，喝一點高粱，嚼一頓大肉是作為「壓歲」的——這是做生意的迷信，賺了錢的大魚大肉，不賺錢的也得像像樣閪的嚼一頓，否則明年就做不到好賣買。</p>
<p>可是這年頭兒出了怪，這條從有歷史以來平安的山道，今年發生了數次劫案，省城里曾派了保安隊在要道口駐紮，但是大小劫案都是來無踪去無形的抓不到人。老頭搖頭嘆息着：「人心不古，世道日微！」他讀過書，他懂得這個；他担憂着劫案或許有一天要發生在他店里，那末，數十年辛苦積聚起來的錢都是白費心機，而且這份安穩賣買也無法繼續下去，現在那些商隊不都甯願繞二日夜的水道上省城去嗎？老頭恐惶着，每天啣着旱烟袋站在店門口望山頂—其實他望着太陽。正午過了，沒有打尖的客商，他希望太陽慢一點落山；太陽一落山，他的希望完了。好年好勢晚上都沒有客商，這個年頭兒還有趕夜路的人嗎？但是沒有用，陰曆年底很快地到了眼前，幾甕好酒都沒有開「泥坪」。（酒甕上的泥蓋）於是老頭在一天早上一股氣的跑上省城，回店時候帶來兩名腰里佩着盒子砲的保安隊，老頭顯得異常興奮，踏進店門就高聲喊着小伙計：</p>
<p>「小毛子，快點宰一只大雄雞，開一甕酒，兩位老總要常住在我們店里了。」</p>
<p>老頭面上開了光，偶或有客商來打尖住夜，他一定指着兩名保安隊說：「怕什麼呢，老總住在我們店里！繞二日夜的水道上省城是鬼兒子的主意，俺老頭做了幾十年賣買，從沒有差池，老總你說？」</p>
<p>老總們笑笑，每天有酒有肉，有什麼差池呢？</p>
<h3>醒後</h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>我醒了。</p>
<p>睡床靠近窗，隔着玻璃格子，看得見十二月中間之夜的天空，月光靜靜的溫柔的帶來一片冷落到枕邊來。窗外，風停樹靜，寒狗也不發一聲抖顫，一切都睡着靜着，任夜霜凍縮一切聲音，一切顫動。</p>
<p>望着上面小圓形的帳頂，冷清與寂寥交給我一個淒涼的心情。這個小房，不，是這個小床，它太空虛，太冷寞了。這深夜，伴陪我的只有這個小圓形的帳頂和一片清冷的月光啊；夢也把我扔下，於是我把眼光再移到窗外，那一角夜空，幾成了靜靜的藍色的海，它無邊深幽，沒有崖岸，我就是海上一隻舟呀。</p>
<p>然而，我望見尋幾隻星星了，它們不就是一點點希望的珠光嗎？唉，親切的故侶呀，你們也沒有把我忘記麼？你儘對我瞇起笑意的眼，是否要私私告訴我過往的一切？我終於大息起來，我記起故鄉秋夜星華月滿的天階……這一串美麗的夢兒，而今都在時間的輪齒下軋碎了，風光依舊的可是那天上的星星。</p>
<p>檯上小鐘的跳聲分明把時間一秒一分的拖過去。空間到了什麼時候了呢，天快光明了嗎？我眞有點焦急起來了，這隻小鐘又不會敲出點數來給我聽。我就想起家里那隻古舊的大自鳴鐘，人靜更深的夜半，那嘡嘡的鐘聲，聽來是多麼閑散悠遠啊。誰曾受驚於這美妙和鐘聲嗎？我不信！然而，今夜一樣更深，一樣人靜，一樣從夢里醒來，我只有孤冷的睡在異鄉的旅寓里想念隻古舊的大鐘。</p>
<p>遠遠送來火車響，又是第幾班夜行列車開行呢。我又想起幾個被生活逼着散逐征途的友人了，他們也是幸福的棄兒啊，今夜是否也同我一樣醒着麼？哦，生活，讓我為他們祝福罷。</p>
<h3>讓我回到南方去吧</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>對着眼前這飄雪片的隆冬，北風如尖刀虎虎地吹嘯着的日子，闇闇的天幕世間眞變成一個可怖的廢墟，還有什麼，值得人留戀呢？讓我回到南方去吧！南方，生長我的故鄉啊！那兒，海空遼闊的一邊，長年有着溫暖的陽光，柔和的季候風，蕩漾在微風里的泛着錦繡漣漪的湖水，在冬天里邊，所有的麗景依然保留着，梅子還綻開一樹粉紅色的花，白色的花，以及雜色的花，芬香灑漫郊外的原野。這些都是使人永遠倦戀不忘的。而在家園中是繚繞着更親暱的笑聲，欵密的話語，和更可愛的家人熱情的嘴臉……可是這里北國的冬日會有綠色的葉子，飄香的梅子麼？天老是愁抑着擺着古銅色，最後一瓣木葉也捲落到水溝中，不久就是連河溪亦凝成冰床的時候了。讓我回到南方去啊！死也願意死在生長的地方而這些日子流浪者的滋味是嚐够了的，長長的飄泊生涯已經摧折了年輕人的夢，年輕人的憧憬，蒼老了青春的心，我是感到異樣倦累了，然而這究竟只是幻想，在這冷風里，雪的日子里，我仍舊得終朝奔波着。不知為什麼而整天忙碌，若說是為生活，實在是太乏味了，並且我的精力差不多已無法再支持下去，如果還是這樣，也許明天，也許後天，我就會頹然地倒下來，我眞是需要一個溫和的境地安靜歇地息一一下。我憧憬着生長地的南方啊！</p>
<p>讓我回到南方去吧。這都會的色彩使人極度憎惡，這北國的冬日又使人感到索然無趣。在南方，我可以恢復甯貼的心靈，恢復精神上的均衡，重拾起舊時的墮夢，那兒有我所愛慕的東西。</p>
<p>讓我回到南方去吧。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>周璇戲弄大胖子</h3>
<p>——在「火燭之夜」中——</p>
<p>「花燭之夜」昨天拍關宏達背書一幕，一時笑聲充滿整個攝影棚，空氣極盡輕縣融洽，什麼原因呢？且聽我道來：——</p>
<p>原來關宏遠在「花燭之夜」中節一個李家的少爺，但他生性卻極愚笨，他的父親（姜修飾）見狀甚悲，然亦不得不加教誨，俾其能粗屢經導，「趙錢孫李」四字中之末尾李字終不能記憶腦中。姜修解釋說：「是我們姓李的李」，彼亦照樣答「是我們姓李的李」姜修說：「你麼這樣笨」？彼亦念「你怎麼這樣笨」，姜修觀此情形，不禁嘆息摇首而出。但他仍跑在地上念著「你怎麼這樣笨」不已，會是時，其家丫頭（周璇飾）出來睹狀，乃躡足走近棹邊舉起姜修的模樣，喊說：「是笨牛的牛」。</p>
<p>而在這中間，是有著無限滑稽的演出，一個頑皮小丫頭戲弄一個魯笨大少爺的情景，實足使人捧腹其間笑通肚子哩。</p>
<h3>國泰公映的「忠魂錄」</h3>

<h3>Xiao Zhenying Arrives in Tianjin, Visits Tada to Discuss Hebei-Chahar Affairs, Japanese Side Advocates Local Resolution of Chahar East Issue, Doihara's Departure from Changchun for Tianjin Undecided, Bao Yueqing Arrives in Peiping to Discuss Gathering of Puppet Troops in Zhangbei, Chen Juesheng Goes to Tianjin to Negotiate Loan Matters</h3>
<p>Tianjin. Xiao Zhenying returned to Tianjin from Peiping at 9:10 a.m. on the 6th and immediately went to the Municipal Government to review official documents. At 12:00, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, he visited Commander Tada at his residence in Zhang Garden in the Japanese Concession to discuss the Chahar East and Hebei East affairs. Chen Juesheng also exchanged views with Tada and Nagami regarding the puppet Hebei East government’s deduction of funds from stations east of Tanggu. The discussion lasted for about an hour before they departed. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch. Regarding the Chahar East affair, the representative of the Kwantung Army advocates a local resolution, treating it separately from the Hebei East and Tanggu incidents. It is also necessary to invite representatives from Inner Mongolia, including the leader of the Mongolian Security Force, Zhuo Shuhai, to participate in a four-party conference involving China, Japan, Mongolia, and Manchukuo, to decide on the defense zones and troop deployments outside the Great Wall in Zhangbei and surrounding counties. Our side has not agreed to this proposal. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Colonel Nagami, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison Army, returned to Tianjin from Yuguan at 6:30 a.m. on the 6th after inspecting the troops. Nagami stated that the Chahar East affair falls within the scope of the Kwantung Army and must be directly negotiated with Dabon, the military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, Tanaka, the head of the Chengde Special Service Organ, and Ueda, the head of the Duolun Special Service Organ. He can only assist from the sidelines. Commander Tada expressed the same view. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping. Bao Yueqing, Director of the Peiping Office of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, arrived in Peiping this morning from Zhangjiakou. According to him, the Chahar North issue is generally the same as what is circulating in Peiping. After the westward advance of the puppet troops led by Li Shouxin, none of our security forces are stationed in the remaining five counties except for Shangdu. However, the puppet troops are currently concentrated in Zhangbei County, and the puppet troops from other counties have not entered. Our security forces withdrew voluntarily, leaving the local defenses feeling empty. In response to the requests of merchants and residents, the Mongolian Security Force has been deployed to fill the defenses, with a total of 3,000 men. Therefore, each county can be allocated approximately two to three hundred men. It is difficult to predict the future developments regarding the Chahar North issue. As for the solution, it depends on Peiping’s opinion. If Peiping has no appropriate solution, the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee will resolve it locally to cope with the actual situation. De Wang has now sent personnel to Baocheng and the herding areas to invite Zhuo Shuxun, the commander of the security forces, and responsible personnel from various banners to a meeting at De Wang's residence in Pangjiang within the next few days to discuss countermeasures. De Wang remains in Pangjiang due to his mother's ongoing illness, while Yun Wang is in Bailingmiao, presiding over political affairs. Regarding the dispute in the Alxa Banner, which is an outstanding Mongolian issue, Tang Kesan arrived in Peiping a few days ago to meet with various parties and mediate. The central government has not yet allocated funds for the construction of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee. He himself is scheduled to visit Song Zheyuan this afternoon to discuss everything. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping. Regarding the issue of interception of funds on the Xinhe-Yuguan section, Zhang Jia'ao originally intended for the Railway Ministry to handle it independently after arriving in Peiping. Subsequently, it was decided that Chen Juesheng would be responsible for negotiating a solution with the Japanese side. It is reported that after Chen arrived in Tianjin, he will begin consultations today. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, a Japanese plane took off from the BaliTai airfield in Nankai, Tianjin, carrying Lieutenant Colonel Wachi Takaji, a staff officer of the Tianjin Garrison Army, to Changchun to exchange views on the Hebei East issue with the Kwantung Army headquarters. Opinions on resolving the Hebei East issue remain divided. Someone in Shenyang with influence desires to claim credit by directly negotiating with the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. This individual in Shenyang and the Kwantung Garrison Army headquarters still want the puppet Hebei East organization to exist as a source of autonomous policies. Therefore, the Tianjin Garrison has taken measures to prevent this individual in Shenyang from entering the Pass to negotiate. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Tanaka, the head of the Japanese Special Service Organ in Chengde, Ueyama, the head of the Duolun Special Service Organ, and Dabon, the military attaché in Zhangjiakou, left Zhangbei by plane on the 5th for Changchun to report that the talks between China and Japan in Zhangbei had yielded little result. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch. Zhuo Shuhai’s Mongolian Security Force, totaling 1,500 men, are now stationed in Zhangbei, Shichang, Guyuan, Kangbao, Shangdu, and Huade counties, with approximately two to three hundred men in each county. Discipline is good. Zhuo Shuhai himself is in Guyuan, while Li Shouxin is in Baocheng. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. The puppet Hebei East government’s New Yuguan Section Railway Supervisory Office has changed its approach to avoid its true name, encroaching on the Beining Railway administration. All official documents between the station masters and section chiefs east of Tanggu and the Railway Bureau must be reviewed by the office. Passenger and freight fares from major stations such as Tanggu, Tangshan, Luanxian, Changli, and Yuguan have been taken away, reaching 70,000 yuan. There is no definite figure for smaller stations. The Beining Railway authorities are deeply concerned about having no income but only expenses and plan to negotiate a way to stop the puppet government's withdrawals before the Hebei East issue is negotiated. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping. Xiao Zhenying is going to Tianjin today to meet with the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, who has just returned to Tianjin from Changchun, to discuss the Chahar East issue. However, formal negotiations must wait until Doihara returns to Tianjin from Changchun around the 10th before they can begin. Local authorities are reportedly optimistic about the outcome of the talks. According to foreign sources in Zhangjiakou, the six counties in Chahar East have now been taken over by "Manchukuo" personnel and Japanese advisors. Personnel from Suiyuan are very apprehensive, fearing that "Manchukuo" will further transport things westward. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping. Xiao Zhenying, accompanied by Chen Zhongfu, a member of the Diplomatic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, left for Tianjin by car at 5:45 a.m. on the 6th. It is reported that Xiao will visit Tada and Nagami to discuss preliminary ideas for resolving the Hebei East and Chahar North issues. It is reported that Doihara may return to Tianjin on the 10th. There are also reports that the Kwantung Army plans to send someone else to Tianjin to negotiate everything with the local authorities. Doihara may stay in Changchun temporarily. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping. Regarding the issue of the New Yuguan section loan of the Beining Railway being withheld by the traitor Yin, Zhang Jia'ao consulted with Song Zheyuan and others while in Peiping and planned to have the Railway Ministry send someone to demand it back from the traitor Yin. After several considerations, it was decided that Chen Juesheng, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, would handle it directly. Chen has already gone to Tianjin and will begin working on it. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Feng Yuxiang, Sworn into Office, Central Government Sends Li Liejun to Supervise the Oath, Chairman Lin Delivers a Speech of Encouragement</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Feng Yuxiang, Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, held a swearing-in ceremony at the National Government after the memorial service on the 6th. The Central Government sent Li Liejun to supervise the oath. Officials from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions attended the ceremony. After taking their seats, music was played. After Chairman Lin led the attendees in paying respects, the swearing-in ceremony was held. After the ceremony, Li Liejun delivered a speech, followed by a speech from Chairman Lin, and finally a response from Feng. The ceremony concluded with music at 11:00 a.m. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Li Liejun's speech at the swearing-in ceremony of Feng Yuxiang, Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission on the morning of the 6th, was as follows: "When the country is at peace, pay attention to the Prime Minister; when the country is in danger, pay attention to the Generals. Considering today's international situation and domestic conditions, it is indeed a time when both the Prime Minister and the Generals should be valued. The Central Government has carefully selected the Prime Minister and the Generals. Comrade Feng is one of them. At present, most countries in the world are exhausting the people's wealth and striving to expand their military preparations, which harbors the greatest crisis. However, from another perspective, in order to maintain international peace, it is necessary to have a foundation in military affairs. Our country, in this raging tide, should reorganize its existing military equipment. The Military Affairs Commission is the central hub of the military, with heavy responsibilities. Comrade Feng's achievements are brilliant and admired throughout the country. This time, he and Comrade Yan have been ordered to serve as Vice Chairmen. In the future, with the assistance of these capable individuals, the Chairman will benefit in military affairs. It goes without saying that he will also be able to discuss and plan other major plans to the best of his ability. Although, how can it be said easily? Therefore, there are some words of respect: The people can be approached but not looked down upon. 'The people are the foundation of the country; when the foundation is solid, the country will be secure.' Now, most of the provincial and municipal officials are military personnel, or they are familiar with legal administration. I still hope that the Military Affairs Commission will give them timely instructions to strictly abide by the central laws and regulations, cultivate a spirit of the rule of law, maintain the people's hearts, and promote the people's strength. This is one point. Sima Fa said, 'A country, though large, will perish if it loves war; the world, though peaceful, will be in danger if it forgets war.' Our country has always loved peace, but we must abide by the ancient teachings. This is the second point. The effectiveness of tactics is not as good as strategy; the effectiveness of policies is not as good as political strategy. Putting it all together, no matter which one is effective, it is not as good as national policy. This is the third point. As for 'advancing to think of being loyal, retreating to think of making up for mistakes, promoting their good, and correcting their evil,' the words of the sages have been regarded as the norm by the wise men of all ages who have shouldered the heavy responsibility of the country. This is the fourth point. Today, when Comrade Feng takes office, I respectfully offer these matters, knowing that Comrade Feng will certainly abide by the central government's intentions and expand its effectiveness." Feng Yuxiang replied, "Yuxiang is of limited talent and knowledge, and I am honored that the central government has not abandoned me and appointed me as Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. After receiving the order, I was very apprehensive. At this time when foreign insults are becoming increasingly urgent, Yuxiang, as a member of the party and a soldier, believes in the meaning of 'everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country' and dares not evade responsibility. Therefore, I accepted the new order without measuring my own abilities. Just now, I received four points of encouragement from Committee Member Li sent by the central government, and I also received training from Chairman Lin on military preparation. Yuxiang will sincerely assist Chairman Chiang in doing the work of national rejuvenation, fulfilling the responsibility of saving the country and ensuring its survival, and going through fire and water without hesitation. However, Yuxiang is inherently honest and hopes that all officials and comrades will often give me guidance so as not to fail. Today, I am taking office and I am grateful to all comrades for their presence. Thank you for your kindness." (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin's speech at Feng Yuxiang's inauguration stated, "This Chairman has always admired Comrade Feng. Comrade Feng is not only good at governing the army, but also at sharing weal and woe with the soldiers. He is truly a model for our armed comrades. This time, the central government selected him as the Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, which is truly a cause for celebration. In recent years, Chairman Chiang has spared no effort in planning and reorganizing military affairs. Now that he has the assistance of Comrade Feng, future achievements will surely be even greater. I hope that after taking office, he will continue to base himself on the spirit of the past, assess the national environment and strength, prepare the army and strengthen the military, in order to protect our national sovereignty."

<p>Nanjing. At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, the National Government held a memorial week. Those present included Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Jitao, Li Liejun, Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, Deng Jiayan, Wang Boqun, Ma Chaojun, Niu Yongjian, He Yingqin, Tang Shengzhi, Zhu Peide, Chen Tiaoyuan, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Musong, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Wu Dingchang, Wang Yongbao, Shi Ying, Chen Daqi, Jiao Yitang, Lu Zhonglin, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Xunyong, Cao Haosen, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government, totaling approximately 600 people.

Finally, he encouraged his colleagues to make diligence and frugality the foundation of their lives and of saving the country. The ceremony ended at 10:30 a.m. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th, "At the beginning of this new year, we all have a feeling that we must remove the old things of the past and move forward to a new and bright path. I remember that Premier Sun Yat-sen said in his teachings that most people today cannot be revitalized and easily degenerate, which is very bad, and we must avoid it. Although these words are very short, they have a very broad meaning. How can we be revitalized? How can we prevent people from degenerating? I think the first thing to do is to start with being diligent ourselves. If we are diligent, we will naturally succeed in everything. If the things that should be done today are left for tomorrow, and tomorrow they are left for the day after tomorrow, then everything will be abandoned. The second is to advocate thrift and not waste even a little. Not only should we not waste our own belongings, but we should also not waste public property. Moreover, not only should we be like this with daily utensils, but we should also have a sequence of priorities in our daily affairs and cherish our time, which is also a kind of frugality. The ancients said that diligence can make up for clumsiness and frugality can cultivate integrity, which is indeed a difficult theory. Diligence must not be laziness, frugality must not be greed, and without laziness and greed, one will not degenerate. At the beginning of this year, I will specifically talk about the words in Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings that urge us to be revitalized, hoping that everyone will be diligent and frugal in public and private matters in the future, and strive to move forward on the bright path." (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Vice Chairman Chiang's Report at the Memorial Week: "The Great Path of Being Human, Revolution, and Nation-Building"</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Vice Chairman Chiang delivered a report at the Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week on the 6th. The original text is as follows: Comrades, today we are holding the first Premier's Memorial Week of the new year. In the last Memorial Week, I already explained the responsibilities that our party comrades should fulfill, especially the awareness and efforts that everyone should have after the Fifth National Congress. In the previous Memorial Week, I also reported to you the great path of being human, revolution, and nation-building in a concise manner. The main idea is that if we want to be human, we must have the principles of being human. If we want to have a revolution, we must have the principles of revolution. If we want to govern and build the country, we must also have the principles of governing and building the country. Moreover, these principles are interconnected and consistent, and they are immutable. We must follow these principles and work hard, only then can we succeed. Up to now, we have not yet become successful human beings, the modern national revolution has not yet been successful, and a new country has not yet been established. This is all because we have not found the right way, that is, so-called "human affairs have not been exhausted," and absolutely cannot be attributed to fate or destiny. Therefore, if we do not understand the principles of being human, revolution, and nation-building, and strive according to these principles, but just muddle through, then we will definitely fail in the end, and even lead to the demise of the country without knowing the reason. Therefore, we must not fail to understand this great path, examine ourselves at all times, and constantly strive for self-improvement and daily renewal of our virtue. Whether we are individuals, a party, or a country, we must have the spirit of "daily renewal, and again renewal", and be able to continuously progress, only then can we survive and develop, complete all new undertakings, and open up a completely new life. If we want to enable ourselves as individuals, and our society and country, to be able to renew ourselves daily, the most important thing is to be diligent in introspection and courageous in correcting mistakes, and we must also encourage each other and sincerely learn from each other. If our comrades see others making mistakes, but do not advise them with a loving and sincere attitude, treat comrades as strangers, think that their mistakes have nothing to do with them, and are indifferent, then they have lost the duty of a revolutionary party member. As a result, neither the party members nor the party will make progress, and we will also fail our party and our comrades. Therefore, there is one thing I must first bring up and tell everyone. Today, I see that everyone's spirit is very good and everything is very orderly. I feel very gratified. If there are one or two comrades who, although their clothes are neatly dressed, their shoes are not properly checked, and they casually wear the shoes they usually wear in the bedroom and walk into the auditorium to attend the Premier's Memorial Week, this is really somewhat careless. Everyone must know that all our undertakings must start from our own self-cultivation, and the most basic, most practical, and easiest to express things in self-cultivation are the four aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. As for clothing, it is something that is always worn and closely follows the body, and its importance can be imagined. Therefore, we must ask for true neatness and cleanliness from the inside out, from top to bottom. Like the example I just mentioned of wearing slippers, although the clothes and hats are clean, wearing shoes that are limited to indoor use into the auditorium is to take care of the top but not the bottom, and is not in accordance with the rules. Don't think this is a small matter. You must know that the most important spirit for our revolutionary party to do things is to be thorough and practical. No matter what things are, we must do them from top to bottom, inside and out, practically, completely, and perfectly. We must never see the top and abandon the bottom, be nominally but not practically, only talk about a superficial form, and have no internal true spirit. In the past, the shortcomings of our people and all institutions in doing things were here. Since the establishment of the National Government, our party has shouldered the responsibility of governing the country for eight years. The reason why we have not been able to govern the country well until now is also here. From now on, we must change this shortcoming and be practical and realistic in everything, and do it thoroughly. For example, in terms of clothing, we must be neat and clean from head to toe, from underwear to outerwear, and especially when handling affairs and participating in gatherings, we must be extra neat. All our life actions should be so thorough, practical, neat and unified. In modern terms, it is what is called "militarization" and "discipline", which is also the "propriety" of the "four virtues" that we advocate. The ancients said, "Propriety is the governance of things... If there is no propriety, then the hands and feet have no place to put, the eyes and ears have nothing to add, and advances and retreats, bows and concessions have no control... Hunting and military affairs lose their strategy, and military skills lose their control... Officials lose their body, and politics loses its rotation, adding to the body and placing it in front, and the movement of the masses loses its appropriateness, in this way, there is no way to harmonize with the masses". It has already made it clear that "propriety" refers to the order of all things, that is, to talk about everything being disciplined. Therefore, we can explain very simply, clearly and accurately, "propriety" is "militarization". If a person does not understand propriety - is not militarized, he cannot become a modern citizen, let alone a modern revolutionary party member. Similarly, if a society or a country has no propriety - is not militarized, it cannot be a modern society or a modern country, and it cannot survive in the modern world. Therefore, if we want to be modern citizens, and to establish a modern country of freedom and equality that can compete with all countries in the world, we must vigorously "advocate martial arts" and practically and thoroughly "militarize". The so-called "advocating martial arts" and "militarization" does not mean that everyone should carry guns and cannons, but that everyone should be able to cultivate the martial virtues of "knowledge, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness", and be able to "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline", starting from our daily practical life such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, everything should be disciplined and militarized, which is also the so-called "scientification" and "modernization". The meaning of this passage is to point out the shortcomings that I saw in one or two comrades, and at the same time, I hope that everyone will encourage each other to implement it, and truly embark on a new life of "uniformity" that conforms to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame", and is "militarized". Secondly, I have already explained at the Memorial Week that the Great Learning is the most basic and important principle for being human, revolution, and nation-building, and I have explained to you the three principles of the Great Learning - the so-called "manifesting illustrious virtue", "renovating the people", and "abiding in perfect goodness". Today, I will continue what I said last time and tell you about the eight items of the Great Learning. The Great Learning originally said, "Those who wish to manifest illustrious virtue throughout the world will first govern their states. Those who wish to govern their states will first regulate their families. Those who wish to regulate their families will first cultivate their personal lives. Those who wish to cultivate their personal lives will first rectify their minds. Those who wish to rectify their minds will first make their wills sincere. Those who wish to make their wills sincere will first extend their knowledge. The extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things." Then it goes on to say, "When things are investigated, then knowledge is extended; when knowledge is extended, then the will becomes sincere; when the will is sincere, then the mind is rectified; when the mind is rectified, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, then the family is regulated; when the family is regulated, then the state is governed; when the state is governed, then the world is at peace." These two paragraphs repeatedly point out, from the end to the beginning, and then from the beginning to the end, the eight important items and the rational stages from being human to pacifying the world. Premier Sun Yat-sen extremely admired this subtle and unfolding political philosophy from the root to the branch, from the inside to the outside, from the small to the large, and from the near to the far. He said, "The passage in the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean about investigating the nature of things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, rectifying the mind, regulating the personal life, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world, develops a person from the inside out, starting from the inside of a person and extending to pacifying the world. Such a subtle and unfolding theory... is a unique treasure in our knowledge of political philosophy." The ultimate and greatest goal of our revolution is to achieve "the Great Harmony of the World", that is, to "pacify the world", that is, to "manifest illustrious virtue throughout the world". The so-called "manifesting illustrious virtue throughout the world" means to enable all people in the world to develop their inherent bright, pure, bright, beautiful and good virtues. In other words, it is to enable the world's human beings to reach a state of civilization, prosperity and happiness. How can the world's human beings reach a state of civilization, prosperity and happiness? This is to realize our Premier's Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the real political meaning of the sentence "manifesting illustrious virtue throughout the world" is to make all people in the world believe in and follow the Three Principles of the People, so that the brilliance of the Three Principles of the People will universally shine on the world, so that all mankind can eliminate all past dark and unjust, unreasonable and unjust psychology and things, and create a peaceful, happy, glorious and brilliant new world and new civilization. But this ideal is very high and this goal is very far. If we want to achieve the goal of pacifying the world, we must "first govern our state", that is, we must first govern our own country well, and first enable the thoughts, actions, living habits, etc. of the people of the whole country to be thoroughly reformed, truly believe in and vigorously practice the Three Principles of the People, and build a civilized and powerful new country of the Three Principles of the People. We must first achieve this step before we can make the people of the world believe in and vigorously practice the Three Principles of the People and daily renew their inherent virtues, and jointly establish a peaceful and happy world of Great Harmony. If our own people are still dirty, lazy, decadent, and acting as backward and uncivilized people, and our society and country are always chaotic, dark, fragile, and poor, and not like a modern society and a modern country, then no matter how broad and brilliant the Three Principles of the People are, and no matter how noble and beautiful our ideals are, people will not admire or believe them no matter what, and the Three Principles of the People will not be universally implemented in the world. Therefore, it is said, "Those who in ancient times wished to manifest illustrious virtue throughout the world first governed their state". But the country is very large, the people are very many, and the affairs of the state are very complicated. If we want to govern a state well, of course, it cannot be done casually, and we must start with one part at a time. Therefore, it is said, "Those who wished to govern their states first regulated their families". The so-called "family", according to a rigid interpretation of the literal meaning, is "family". However, we should extend the meaning of family to generally refer to all households in the country, or all groups, institutions and societies within the country. For example, our revolutionary party is a family, and our school can also be said to be a family. The so-called "regulating the family" means starting from the family, school, institution, group, and society to which we each belong, and using all methods of politics and education to make everything in all households in the country neat and orderly, and everyone in the society can be reasonable, law-abiding, and orderly. Especially in the economic aspect, we should follow Confucius' ideal of "equality without poverty, harmony without scarcity, and security without collapse", and use all effective means such as investigation, statistics, adjustment, and cooperation to seek a rational distribution, so that the people's lives and the survival of the society can achieve balanced and universal development, and there should be no excessive disparity and great injustice in everything such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and then the society can fundamentally seek stability, peace, uniformity. If we want to enable a family, a group, a party, or a society to be neat and orderly in everything, from what place should we start? The Great Learning says, "Those who wished to regulate their families first cultivated their personal lives". Everything must start with our own self-cultivation. Speaking of the importance of self-cultivation, I am really very ashamed and repentant. I think if I could have followed Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings earlier, and strived to cultivate myself according to our inherent and most precious political philosophy, our country and society should not be as dangerous and chaotic as they are now, and the general youth would definitely not be as painful as they are now. The reason why everything in the country and society cannot be governed well now is because our party members in general have not paid attention to self-cultivation in the past, cannot set an example in everything, and cannot make the people believe that what our revolutionary party members say can be done. Like in the past, we only knew how to post slogans, shout slogans, and issue declarations, but we could not practice what we preached and be practical. Where is there any reason not to fail? The ancients said, "Governing is not in many words, but in how to practice it with effort." They also said, "If one's person is upright, one will be obeyed without orders; if one's person is not upright, one will not be obeyed even with orders." It can be seen that if we want to lead the people, transform the society, and govern the country well in the future, we can only start with self-cultivation in a practical way. The first step in self-cultivation is to reform our own living habits and implement a new life of "neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, diligence, quickness, and reliability". However, "the body is the tool of the mind". All our habit reforms are only external expressions of cultivation, and the true fundamental effort lies in the heart and will that is contained within the body. The mind must be rectified and the will must be sincere, and then one can truly be upright in word and deed and have no hypocrisy. Therefore, it is said, "Those who wish to cultivate their personal lives first rectified their minds; those who wish to rectify their minds first made their wills sincere". Therefore, no matter when and where we are, we must restrain evil thoughts, calm our minds, concentrate our minds, and rectify our intentions, and we must examine ourselves at all times for what we are going to say and what we are going to do, and everything must be "worthy of heaven above, and worthy of people below", and "judge it in our hearts and be at peace, and measure it according to the principles of heaven and be obedient."

<p>Beiping. People from Inner Mongolia say that the climate in Inner Mongolia this year is unusually cold. In recent days, there has been continuous heavy snow, about three feet thick, which has blocked traffic. Cars travel only dozens of miles a day, and the temperature has reached 37 degrees below zero Celsius. The extremely cold climate is rare in the past decade, and many people and livestock have been frozen to death. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Economic World This Year</h3>
<p>Since the currency reform, the inherent instability factors in China's economy have not been eliminated, and external destructive forces have intensified. Can it escape the so-called major crisis of 1936 predicted by international fortune tellers this year? Although economic phenomena are constituted by society, and the crisis it encounters is certainly unavoidable, it all depends on our efforts.</p>
<p>We deeply know that China is an economically backward country and is often in a passive position. This is evident in the silver problem. In recent years, China's economy has been severely hit by changes in world silver prices. Although the price of silver has plummeted a few days ago and has recently returned to stability, the competition between Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Far East economic world is just beginning. Britain took the lead, the United States followed closely, and Japan used its skills from the side, hoping that China would be forced to surrender and fall into its arms when it was unable to resist the pressure from both sides. At the beginning of the implementation of our new monetary policy, Britain tried its best to maintain the price of silver in order to protect its interests among silver-using countries in the Far East. The Japanese seized the opportunity to transport Chinese silver. The United States countered by suppressing silver prices by not buying silver, making it unprofitable. However, the United States, which has accumulated gold and owns silver, is unwilling to give up its ambition to build a golden yuan empire, and will eventually manipulate the situation between gold and silver. Judging from the recent US-Mexico silver conference and plans to expand to Canada and South American countries, and then mention silver-using countries in the Far East, as well as the recent purchase of huge amounts of Chinese silver, there are no traces to be found. Therefore, the currency war in the past was finally forced to a point where it was useless. It is also hoped that the three countries will work together to stabilize the situation in the Far East in the future.</p>
<p>If China's exchange rate can be maintained stably due to the stabilization of international silver prices, then what will be the future of China's economy? Stable exchange rates can indeed facilitate exports, but most of China's exports are agricultural products, among which silk and tea are the mainstays. The international markets of these two products have already been seized by others, and it is even more difficult to expect other products to improve. China can also restrict imports, but in fact, I am afraid that it cannot be done. In recent years, there is almost nothing in Chinese people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation that is not foreign goods. Rice and wheat are relied on by the people for food, but there is a shortage of foreign rice and wheat imports. Although cotton has exports, a large amount of American and Indian cotton is also imported. Piece goods, woolens, and other industrial products cannot be said to have no production, but their materials mostly come from abroad. Therefore, after the implementation of legal currency, imported goods are often heard to increase in price, while the activities of local products are still insignificant. Although the price increase of foreign goods cannot be used to stimulate the price increase of local products, how can the country's production not be improved to reverse the situation of reduced people's purchasing power and difficult life? Some say that the exchange rate is more expensive and foreign investment is favorable, and we can absorb foreign capital to develop. I do not know that the absorption of foreign capital must first have considerable ability. If there is no ability, it will eventually be a fish on the chopping board and add a layer to economic aggression. In recent years, tariffs have increased and foreign merchants have set up factories in treaty ports. I do not know how many factories have been set up. As far as I have heard, all factories that have been selling well in the market and whose Chinese factories have gradually produced products that can compete with them have factories, so Chinese factories are still difficult to revive. If foreign capital is absorbed under this kind of situation, the Chinese can only get a small portion of their operating expenses and wages, but instead make the economic power of foreigners in China more consolidated. The gains and losses cannot be calculated in terms of reason. Therefore, what we hope from the economic world is to seek economic construction from a down-to-earth and pragmatic approach, and not to do everything possible to decorate the facade and muddle through for a while.</p>
<h3>Under the Threat of Japanese Puppet Troops, Outer Mongolian Authorities Are Determined to Resist; All Assets of Princes and Private Individuals Are Nationalized; The Executive Branch Is Full of Young and Energetic People</h3>
<p>Harbin. Japanese puppet troops are preparing to attack the Soviet Union and annex Outer Mongolia. Border disputes have occurred frequently recently. Since the breakdown of the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conference, the threat of Japanese puppet troops to Outer Mongolia has become more urgent. This has determined that after the head of Outer Mongolia arrived in the Russian capital, he has reportedly made up his mind to prepare to resist the enemy. The political and economic situation in Outer Mongolia has long been planned, and all assets of princes and private individuals throughout the territory have been confiscated and nationalized. The executives are mostly young people who have studied in Russia, Europe, and Japan. They are full of energy. The exact number of troops is unknown. The nationality is extremely complicated, such as Han Chinese, Mongolians, Koreans, and Soviet Russians. It is reported that all registered people throughout the territory can serve in the army. The infantry and cavalry can withstand desert and plain warfare. Moreover, the infantry and cavalry teams have recently been equipped with machine guns and cannons, and a military airfield is being built near Kulun. Flight performances like flocks of geese and crows are often seen. The contact of transportation is that the avenues have military vehicles and the small paths are loaded with camels. The financial control is extremely good. Paper money is commonly used in the folk. Banks are concentrated in the National Bank, so there is no need to worry about financial panic during the war. As for national education, it is helped by the Soviet Union. There are few out-of-school children. Although the general people's wisdom is still inevitably carrying the habit of stubbornness, they are unusually brave and ready to respond to the aggression of the strong enemy at any time.

<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese sources, recently, the Outer Mongolian army moved eastward from the south of Lake Bel and concentrated 200 combat aircraft in the capital, Kulun, actively defending the border against the invasion of Japanese puppet troops.

<h3>Japanese Side Says That the Japan-China Trade Association Can Be Established This Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo. The Japan-China Trade Association was originally scheduled to be established simultaneously by both sides at the end of last year, but it could not hold its founding meeting due to the entanglement of the North China issue. According to Japanese sources, Minister of Industry Wu has asked the Japanese Economic Federation to change the date of the founding meeting to the 27th of this month. The Japanese side also expressed considerable approval. It has been internally decided that the chairman of the Japanese side will be Kodama, the general manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank.

<h3>The London Financial Times Advocates: Continue Foreign Lending; Under the Current Trade Recovery, Britain Should Restore Its Creditor Status</h3>
<p>London - The Financial Times today advocated that Britain should continue to engage in lending to foreign countries. The reason it gave was that Britain is now gradually restoring its status as a creditor nation. It stated that the trade statistics for 1935 are expected to show a surplus of 30 million pounds in British gold. This figure represents the minimum annual surplus that can be hoped for under the current trade recovery. Therefore, gold will flow into Britain. If Britain does not want to imitate the United States in hoarding gold and avoiding the responsibilities of being a creditor, then it is now time to relax its precautions regarding foreign lending. Although we have not lent capital to foreign countries in the past four years, now is indeed a good opportunity to continue lending, at least up to the amount of the annual trade surplus. Even if a completely free capital market must be used, investors and the market have already learned their lesson, and it seems unlikely that they will abuse the authorities' permission. The newspaper also suggested that if the Treasury lifts the ban on foreign lending, it can still reimpose this ban when the British pound needs protection in the future. (6th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The London Silver Syndicate's Efforts to Maintain the Silver Market are Ineffective; Purchasing Futures is Likely to Result in Losses</h3>
<p>London - The Associated Press learned today that the silver syndicate recently organized at the initiative of a major British bank to jointly maintain the silver market purchased 30 to 40 million ounces of futures. These futures are now likely to result in losses because the price set at that time was seven to nine pence higher than the current market price, and most of them will expire and be delivered within two weeks.

<h3>Eastern Fujian Local Communists Attempt to Collude with Pirates</h3>
<p>Fuzhou - After being severely suppressed by the garrison troops, the strength of the local communists in Eastern Fujian has disappeared. Recently, they have been trying to collude with pirates, taking the opportunity to carry out activities, and transporting grain and ammunition by sea for supply. They appear in the waters near Fuyao and Xiyang Islands. The naval, land forces, and police have decided to jointly and thoroughly suppress them. Huang Ligui, Lin Naiqiao, Huang Jiaxi, Fan Tiemin, Ye Fei and other groups have fled into Pingnan County. Xie Zuolin's group has also fled from the Pingyang area of Zhejiang to Xiapu, and joined forces with Feng Pintai's group to plot the looting of grain for the winter. The Fujian and Zhejiang garrisons have launched a large-scale encirclement to annihilate them. (6th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>The London Naval Conference Reopens</h3>
<p>London - The First Committee of the Naval Conference, the General Committee, is scheduled to continue its meeting at Clarence House at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The delegations of various countries had gone to other places for the holidays during the recess, and have now returned here. All the delegations believe that the negotiations after the resumption of the meeting must be carried out actively. An agreement on "quantitative limitation" is likely to be established and must be determined as soon as possible. If it cannot be established, then the issue of "qualitative limitation" should be discussed. (5th Havas)</p>
<p>London - On the afternoon of the 5th, Japanese plenipotentiaries Nagano and Nagai visited the residence of British Counselor Craigie at his invitation. Mr. Craigie first reported the resignation of Foreign Secretary Hoare and requested understanding regarding the appointment of the new Foreign Secretary Eden as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. The two Japanese plenipotentiaries agreed on the spot and decided to formally decide on this issue in the First Committee on the 6th. Craigie then asked the Japanese representatives if there was a way to make the future meetings proceed smoothly, but the Japanese representatives did not answer. Shortly thereafter, American representatives Davis and Stanley and State Department official Philip came to visit. Therefore, the private British-Japanese talks and the British-American talks were merged. Later, French representative Admiral Dike also participated, and everyone exchanged various talks, adjourning at 6:00 PM. At today's meeting, the British and American representatives both wanted to raise the issue of disarmament, but this issue did not become a topic of discussion. Only Davis mentioned the current situation in North China and Manchuria. The Italian representative arrived in London on the evening of the 5th, but did not attend today's meeting. (6th Dentsu)</p>
<p>London - How the Disarmament Conference will progress depends entirely on the attitude of Britain. However, if there is a proposal to consider both quality and quantity at the same time, the conference will be on the verge of crisis. Japan had initially hoped that the principle of a common maximum limit might be recognized. If so, it would not oppose parallel deliberation. However, so far that hope has vanished, so it has decided to absolutely oppose parallel deliberation. Foreign observers seem to believe that Japan will recognize parallel deliberation, so the Japanese delegation may express to foreign reporters why Japan refuses to discuss the issue of quality before the issue of quantity is decided. (5th Dentsu)</p>
<p>London - Japan actually expressed its demand for equality with British and American military strength at last year's committee meeting, so the attitude of Britain and the United States has become increasingly strengthened. British and American committee members have even openly declared that if Japan participates in the conference, it will be very difficult to compromise. Therefore, if the Disarmament Conference continues according to the current situation, it will inevitably break down sooner or later. Therefore, there is a great plan to only have the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy conclude a qualitative agreement and notify Japan, transferring the moral responsibility to Japan as well. However, Japan will absolutely not consider such a strategy and will always advance with its own attitude. (6th Dentsu)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Office Counselor Craigie invited the two Japanese plenipotentiaries Nagano and Nagai to his home at 4:30 PM on the 5th to discuss ways to break the deadlock after the reopening of the Disarmament Conference. (5th Dentsu)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Questioned Extensively Regarding Fortifications on Mandated Islands</h3>
<p>League of Nations Secret Meeting Records Released</p>
<p>Geneva - The records of the recent secret meetings of the Mandates Commission have been released. During the meeting, the committee questioned the Japanese representative Ito extensively for two days regarding Japan's various activities in its mandated islands. A German named Furt had written to the committee detailing his treatment when he visited the Japanese mandated islands for health reasons, saying that he was subjected to unbearable suspicion and troublesome inspections. The Swiss representative of the committee, Rebate, who drafted the report on this matter, said that Japan did not admit to mistreating Furt or illegally restricting his freedom, and said that the Japanese officials on the island were very willing for the German to live there happily. In fact, the information provided by Japan did not seem to be completely satisfactory. If one reads the document provided by Furt and pays a little attention to it, then the disturbing impression that the committee gained from reviewing previous reports and listening to the speeches of the Japanese representatives is further confirmed. Since the islands mandated to Japan cannot be freely inspected by fair-minded people, it will ultimately be impossible to dispel people's concerns. The Japanese representative Ito expressed his opinion that Eastern and Western civilizations are different, and if Eastern problems are judged from a Western standpoint, they cannot be understood. There are no naval or land soldiers on the islands. The Dutch representative Vorz questioned Ito with a responsible article published in the Japanese English newspaper on December 14 (which stated that the islands mandated to Japan are air hubs leading to Australia and outposts of defense, so they are very valuable). The Japanese representative then promised to inquire about the information on this point and report it to the next meeting, and promised to find an answer regarding why various public works are marked on the map, but the wireless telegraph station is not.

<h3>London Sources Speak with Certainty: Japanese-German Military Alliance</h3>
<p>Secret Agreement Drafted with Sixteen Articles; Common Opposition to Russia is the Main Goal</p>
<p>Various Parties Do Not Believe That the United States Will Ultimately Dispel Its Suspicions</p>
<p>London - A very reliable non-official British source told the Associated Press today that Germany and Japan drafted a secret military alliance agreement four months ago, the main goal of which is to deal with Soviet Russia. However, this report could not be confirmed, and some parties do not believe it. According to this source, similar news has been circulating for two years. The aforementioned non-official source said that the agreement could have been made public, but in addition to the common German and Japanese opposition to communist activities, there is also a secret clause that contains detailed measures for military cooperation between the two countries if any one of them is attacked by Soviet Russia. It is claimed that this understanding has sixteen articles, one of which is that both countries will maintain benevolent neutrality if a world war breaks out. British officials today said that they were unaware of this clause, while Polish officials stated that they did not believe the rumor that Poland had also joined. The American diplomatic community here is most skeptical, believing that Germany is currently striving for British political sympathy and is unlikely to conclude such an agreement.

<h3>Close Japanese-Italian Relations; Italy Plans to Extend Far East Route to Osaka; Connect with Japan, Which is Outside the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to a message released by the Osaka Industrial Alliance, Italy's Far East route originally ended in Shanghai.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Communications Expands Wireless Network</h3>
<p>Second Phase Plan with Expenses of 2.5 Million; Seven New Aviation Wireless Radio Stations to be Established</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Ministry of Communications, in order to eliminate dangers due to the annual development of air routes, will establish new aviation wireless radio stations in Fukuoka, Hachijojima, Naha, and Kagoshima with an expense of 700,000 yen. Now, due to the expansion of the scheduled air network, it has decided to establish a second phase plan, investing 2.5 million yen, to establish seven new aviation wireless radio stations between Tokyo and Sapporo, between Japan and Korea, and between Osaka and Takawa, using shortwave power from 500 watts to 2,000 watts to report astronomical weather and aircraft arrival and departure times. The first phase plan for the Naha and Kagoshima radio stations will be completed in March of this year, and Fukuoka and Hachijojima in March of next year. The second phase plan will be completed in the new spring of Showa 13. The main cities of Japan will be equipped with a wireless network to ensure safe air flights and guarantee the certainty of scheduled flights. (6th Dentsu)</p>

<h3>Japan's News Control Policy</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hongshu</p>
<p>The background, current situation, and trends of international news agencies are not only something that administrative and diplomatic authorities and international affairs experts should deeply understand, but also common knowledge that every newspaper reader living in this great era should possess.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Eiji Amau, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke extensively about the "power of communication in diplomatic warfare." He believed that one of the biggest reasons for Germany's failure in the European War was the threat of communication being blockaded by Britain. Britain used its monopoly on submarine cables to cut off Germany's communication network on the one hand, and to publicize Germany's tyranny to the world on the other, thus causing Germany to lose the world's attention and ultimately fail. This made him think of Japan's future fate and say with emotion: "Almost all submarine cables between Japan and foreign countries are controlled by Britain and the United States. The international news published in newspapers is bought from news agencies under the control of Britain and the United States, with almost no freedom or independence to speak of. The international news we read every day depends entirely on foreign communication machines, foreign news agencies, and the transmission and transportation of foreign communication equipment. What will happen if something happens one day? This makes me feel apprehensive! Even in normal times, simply swallowing the news supplied by foreign countries in this way will inevitably make me sigh at the reality of our country's news industry! To break away from this shackle of being controlled by foreign countries, two or three of my colleagues and I firmly believe that even if other constructions are put aside, a first-class news agency must be established first to provide independent and autonomous international news." In fact, the Japan News United Association (abbreviated as Rengo) and the Telegraph Communication Company (abbreviated as Dentsu), which are inherent to Japan, have both signed contracts with major foreign news agencies. Rengo is supplied by news agencies of the Reuters in Britain, Havas in France (Agency Havas), A.P. in the United States (Associated Press of America, abbreviated), Tass Agency in the Soviet Union, and Agenzia Stefani in Italy. Dentsu is almost purely a translation of the American A.P. system telegrams. However, in our country's activities, especially in broadcasting our country's news to the world, it has already occupied a great advantage and shouldered a great mission. However, Japan, which aims to dominate the world, is naturally unwilling to be satisfied with this. Moreover, it is now an era of international propaganda warfare no less than the time when the European War broke out. Due to the compulsion of objective facts and the needs of subjective desires, the Domei News Agency, which advocates independence and autonomy, has emerged as the times require.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Domei News Agency is, on the one hand, an attempt by the Japanese government to compete for the leadership of the world news broadcasting that Britain and the United States have held for decades, and on the other hand, a new development in the policy of implementing news control at home. The former is evidenced by the protest raised by the American Associated Press before its establishment, the declaration made at the time of its establishment to trace Reuters as the mission of the agency, and the criticisms made by British, American, and French newspapers after its establishment. As for the latter, the Japanese government has been trying to control the news for more than a day. The plan to merge Rengo and Dentsu was formulated by former Foreign Minister Uchida, who was famous for "scorched-earth diplomacy" three years ago, and has already received the assistance of the military and the consent of the two companies. The current Foreign Minister Hirota has succeeded him and is following the old rules on this point. He has contacted Dentsu President Hoshirō Mitsunaga several times to discuss the method of acquisition, but now the direction has suddenly changed and a newly established Domei News Agency has been established. There must be a mysterious twist in this.</p>
<p>This kind of twist is, from the standpoint of politics and society, a struggle between totalitarianism and liberalism; from an economic point of view, it is a contest between big capital and small and medium capital.</p>
<p>Among the two news agencies, Rengo and Dentsu, which are inherent propaganda agencies in Japan, Rengo was established in the first year of Showa (Western 1926). It was originally transformed from the Toho News Agency and the International News Agency, and was based on eight major newspapers: Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Jiji Shinpo, Hochi Shimbun, Kokumin Shimbun, and Chugai Shogyo. It receives a subsidy of 300,000 to 500,000 yen from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs every year, and it can be said to be a government-designated agency, so it always obeys the government's will. However, Dentsu, which was established in the 33rd year of Meiji (Western 1900) and has a longer history, is a private enterprise of Hoshirō Mitsunaga. Therefore, whether the Japanese government can thoroughly implement former Foreign Minister Uchida's merger plan to increase the efficiency of domestic and foreign propaganda depends on whether the steps to acquire Dentsu can be achieved.</p>
<p>The government's acquisition negotiations were very smooth at first. The acquisition fee was initially 2 million yen, and Hoshirō Mitsunaga was made a member of the Imperial-appointed House of Peers on the recommendation of former Foreign Minister Uchida. After the current Foreign Minister Hirota took over, it should have been a complete success, and the merger plan could have been implemented and the purpose of control could have been achieved. Unexpectedly, Hoshirō Mitsunaga suddenly changed his attitude and had to break with the government for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. The powerful newspapers in various places that have close relations with Dentsu, such as Hokkaido Times, Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun, and Nagoya Shimbun, firmly oppose the government's acquisition.</p>
<p>2. Dentsu has more than 100 more basic employees than Rengo. If they know that the acquisition is successful, they will definitely be shaken, and most of them will have a sense of aversion.</p>
<p>3. After 36 years of hard work, the company's business is thriving; and the original capital has exceeded one million yen. Now, if the government receives 2 million yen, it will transfer the entire company, both inside and outside, which is too cheap.</p>
<p>The Hokkaido Times President Tobu Higashi and Nagoya Shimbun President Matsuju Koyama, and others have been the most vocal in opposing the government's acquisition. As a result, the government has made concessions and increased the acquisition price of 2 million yen to 2.5 million yen; however, the newspapers that have close relations with Dentsu still insist on opposing it, so the government's initial plan to merge Rengo and Dentsu has to be declared a failure. This is why the call for news control in Japan has been high in the sky for three years, but in fact, it has not been decisively realized. However, the Japanese government has a complete plan for news control, and it must not be stopped because of the failure of the initial steps. Therefore, it has changed its direction and established the Domei News Agency, which is called "the world's first-class" with the News United Association, which has always been designated by the government, as its main body, plus the Japan Broadcasting Corporation and major newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Domei News Agency does not mean that the Japanese government has given up its original plan to acquire Dentsu. In fact, it is strengthening the lineup of totalitarianism and showing the pressure of huge capital, so that Dentsu and local newspapers such as the Hokkaido Times, Fukuoka Nichinichi, and Nagoya Shimbun have to yield! In the past, the government's negotiations on the acquisition of Dentsu were mainly conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the establishment of the Domei News Agency, the Ministry of Communications has been in charge of the negotiations, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military have provided assistance from the side. Recently, Mr. Kiyoshi Akita was informally entrusted by Minister of Communications Mochizuki to travel between Dentsu and local newspapers to persuade them to join the Domei News Agency as soon as possible. However, in fact, the opposition between Dentsu and the Domei News Agency is likely to become inevitable. If Dentsu and others can accept the advice and join the Domei, the issue of news control in Japan for the past three years can be brought to an end. Otherwise, it depends on whether Dentsu's ability can compete with the Domei News Agency supported by the government. Local newspapers such as the Hokkaido Times, Fukuoka Nichinichi, and Nagoya Shimbun have lost most of their readers in recent years due to the decline of rural areas, and the Asahi and Nichinichi have invaded the inland, setting up branches in Moji and Nagoya, which has given them a great threat. Their lives mostly depend on Dentsu. Therefore, the trend of news control in Japan still depends on whether Dentsu is willing to join the Domei News Agency and whether it can eternally oppose the Domei News Agency. In other words, whether the Japanese government's second strategy to acquire Dentsu by establishing the Domei News Agency can be effective.</p>
<h3>Flooding in France</h3>
<p>Paris - Rivers throughout France are rising severely, the extent of which and the universality of its nature are unprecedented. Some places have already suffered from floods, and other places are also at risk of flooding. However, it is fortunate that the disaster has not yet occurred. The water level of the Seine River, which flows through Paris, has reached the alert point tonight. If it rises by another meter, navigation will be interrupted. The water level of the Loire River, both upstream and downstream, has already reached the shore, and some areas in the city of Landes at the estuary have become swamps. In addition, the downstream wind is strong, so the difference between the river water and the Atlantic Ocean level is only 50 centimeters. The Orne River near the city of Caen in the north also has a tendency to overflow to the shore. Some sections of the railway between Paris and the port of Bordeaux in southwestern France have been blocked by river water. The water level of the Saône River in the east has reached its highest point, and the Rhône River is also at risk of rising, so the southeastern corner is in a very dangerous situation. In addition, the waters of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers in the southwest have also reached the shore, and the low-lying areas of Agen, Marmande, and Bordeaux have been submerged. According to the National Meteorological Bureau, it will continue to rain in the coming days, but it will be intermittent. It is reported that the warm winter this year has been considered fortunate by the people of the country, but who knows that the water has been rising continuously, and everyone has turned joy into fear. People now hope that the climate will turn cold, so as to kill the water and avoid disasters. Regarding this matter, officials should have already taken various preventive measures, so even if the flood becomes a disaster, the losses should only be limited to material aspects.

<p>Abyssinia Capital - It is predicted today that fierce battles will break out on the northern and southeastern fronts, as the Italian army wants to penetrate the Abyssinian hinterland with its frontlines and consolidate its positions that are currently threatened by guerrillas. The Italian army is now planning to take a new and powerful offensive on all fronts before the bi-seasonal truce. The following points can prove this determination:</p>
<p>Italian military aircraft are intensifying bombing; two new Italian divisions have arrived in the Duro area; the traffic in Magal is increasingly at risk of interruption, and the Italian army urgently needs to protect itself; the Italian army claims that it will do its best to suppress the Abyssinian in order to avenge the cruel methods of the Abyssinian; in the past two weeks, the Italian army has released poison gas many times. (5th Kuomintang News Agency)</p>

Those who can expose the names of other traitors and inform the government forces will be pardoned. (5th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Rome - General De Destai, the son-in-law of the Abyssinian, recently divided his troops into three columns from the city of Doro on the southern route to attack the Italian frontlines. One of the columns is advancing along the border of British Kenya. According to military sources here, General Badoglio, the senior commissioner of East Africa and the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, stated in a press release issued today that the military operations on the Somaliland front of the southern route are aimed at meeting the column led by General De Destai of the Abyssinian. (6th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Rome - Today, a battle report was received from General Badoglio, the commander of the Italian army in East Africa, stating that the Italian aircraft on all routes were very active. The Italian army fought several small battles with the Abyssinian in the Danakil area and near the confluence of the Gabat River and the Bifale River, and drove back the Abyssinian outposts. In all the battles, two officers and two soldiers of the Italian army were killed or wounded. The Italian army on the Somali front has occupied the town of Amega on the banks of the Ganale Doria River.

<h3>Italian Air Force Bombs the Northern and Southern Fronts Rampantly</h3>
<p>Poison Gas in Heavy Fog Rains Down Like Rain - Abyssinian Army Has Not Suffered Major Losses</p>
<p>Taixi - Italian aircraft bombed the area around Amba Alagi, south of Magal, yesterday, dropping many gas bombs, killing four Abyssinian soldiers.

<p>Abyssinian Capital - The largest air force attack in a single day since the start of the war was on Saturday and Sunday. On that day, the Italian air force dropped bombs on both the northern and southern fronts. Observers said that all the Italian air force in East Africa participated in this battle. Most of the bombs dropped were poison gas bombs, but the Abyssinian authorities said that the losses in this battle were not comparable to the Italian military's waste of materials. The Abyssinian army fired rifles, and one aircraft was shot down and crashed, and the fuselage was burned. Both pilots were killed. Observers believe that the purpose of this battle is that the Italian army wants to launch a large-scale attack in Sudan, and its biggest goal is to cut off the road for transporting military supplies from Sudan, and to occupy militarily important castles on the border of Sudan in preparation for the use of the British and Italian in case of discord. Binwah City was completely destroyed by the Italian air force on Saturday and Sunday, leaving only ruins. The Egyptian Red Cross near the city was also bombed by the Italian army the day before, and all equipment was burned. Fortunately, no one was injured in this battle, because the alarm was released in advance, giving the people a chance to escape. (5th Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Swedish Ambulance Team Leader Describes the Bombing in Detail</h3>
<p>Stockholm - The Italian military aircraft carried out bombing in the city of Doro on the southern route of Abyssinia earlier. The Swedish Red Cross ambulance team there was bombed and destroyed. Dr. Hilland, the captain of the team, was injured and was sent to Abyssinian Capital by plane yesterday morning. According to a message received here from Abyssinian Capital, after Dr. Hilland arrived in Abyssinian Capital, he declared to the representative of the International Red Cross stationed in Abyssinian Capital, Mr. Blanc, and the representatives of the Abyssinian Red Cross about the bombing at that time, saying that "the Swedish ambulance team arrived at Marga Dadaga, 80 kilometers away from Doro City, on December 21 last year. The place is on the right bank of the Canal River, and it is five kilometers away from the outpost of the troops of Abyssinian Prince Suis Destai. All the flags and signs used by the Red Cross were displayed in obvious places, and one of the flags, which was three square meters, was particularly noticeable. There were no armed Abyssinian soldiers or Europeans in the vicinity. On the morning of December 22, two Italian aircraft suddenly hovered over the ambulance team, and then dropped bombs everywhere, and alternately fired machine guns at the ambulance trucks and the Red Cross flags. Fortunately, no one was hit. In the days that followed, Italian aircraft repeatedly flew over, flying very low, but did not drop bombs. In the battle on December 30, the Italian aircraft suddenly carried out a fierce bombing from a height of 200 meters, dropping no less than 100 explosive bombs. Afterwards, it fired machine guns and swept the ambulance team. All the tents of the team were bombed and destroyed. One of the tents where surgery was performed had as many as 450 bullet holes. 28 wounded soldiers who were left for treatment were tragically bombed to death.

<h3>Italy Considers Withdrawing from the League of Nations in Retaliation for Sanctions</h3>
<p>Rome - The world's resentment over the Italian aircraft bombing of the Swedish Red Cross in Abyssinia has increased the anger of the Italian people. The atmosphere here is very tense regarding the issue of whether Italy should withdraw from the League of Nations. The Italian semi-official newspaper Weekly said that Italy can no longer absorb the atmosphere of Geneva. "Or ask why Italy does not withdraw from the League of Nations. The answer to this question is: if Italy can resist all the torrents in Geneva, it is unwilling to increase the European disputes by withdrawing from the League of Nations, but Italy's ability to resist the torrents is limited, and everything now is to eliminate this kind of power." The Italian press is strongly criticizing the efforts of various countries to intensify economic sanctions by taking advantage of the Swedish Red Cross's accident. They also say that the Italian people do not believe that this kind of propaganda can make the oil sanctions implemented. Officials said that in retaliation for the sanctions, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations and will never use war as a threat. (5th Kuomintang News Agency)</p>
<h3>US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees Consider New Neutrality Bills</h3>
<p>The Lunn and Rayburn Proposals are More Severe - Investigation into the Morgan Bank Case Begins</p>
<p>Washington - The House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to consider the two neutrality bills proposed by its chairman, Congressman McReynolds, and Senator Pittman. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to consider them. The proposers all expect that the two bills will be sent to the Senate and House of Representatives without discussion. McReynolds' bill argues that the president may have the right to restrict the shipment of goods used for war, so that the amount shipped to the belligerent countries is limited to the amount in peacetime, except for food and medicine, and argues for severing financial ties with the belligerent countries. The purpose of this bill is to make the policy of President Roosevelt, who accepts any trade, the responsibility of the merchants themselves, into a legal system. Pittman's bill argues that the president should be allowed to restrict goods shipped to belligerent countries that exceed the amount in peacetime. Today, Republican Senator Nye also proposed a fourth neutrality bill. This bill has less freedom of action and decision than the other three. It is likely to be shelved by the committee, and Nye can only amend Pittman's proposal to extend his argument. A third bill that is more active than the first and second bills was proposed by Congressman Ludlow in the House of Representatives, arguing that after the outbreak of war, the United States should immediately prohibit the export of goods or any loans to the belligerent countries. At the same time, the special committee of the Senate to investigate the arms manufacturing industry, chaired by Nye, will begin today to thoroughly investigate the trends that drew the United States into the World War in the past. The committee is now considering inviting internationally renowned banker Morgan and his partner Lamont to attend the meeting to explain the situation of the United States assisting the Entente countries financially. Nye claims that this move can influence Congress to pass a law prohibiting loans to belligerent countries. (6th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington - Congressman McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, submitted a new Neutrality Act to the House of Representatives on the third day of the reopening of Congress, proposing to amend the current law so that it becomes a permanent Neutrality Act. There are also Congressman Nye, Congressman Clark, and Congressman Maverick who have jointly proposed another bill, which is more severe than the Reynolds bill, and will be sent to the Secretariat of the House of Representatives tomorrow. The most important difference between the two bills is that the Reynolds bill argues for granting the president the power to act conveniently, while the Nye et al. proposal wants to find a way to increase the mandatory measures in the current law (that is, measures that must be taken). The main points are as follows: Request for the automatic implementation of embargo measures. Once another country declares war, the United States should simultaneously announce an arms embargo. Adopt a quota system for the export business of war supplies, and use the average export volume within five years before the war as the standard. Strictly restrict commercial loans to belligerent countries. Prohibit American people from traveling in war zones, except for those who have special permission. If goods shipped to belligerent countries encounter danger in the middle, the responsibility should be borne by the foreign government that purchased the goods. Penalties should be imposed on belligerent ships that abuse the American flag. Those who violate this law will be fined US$100,000 or imprisoned for ten years (according to the Reynolds bill, the fine is US$10,000 and the imprisonment is five years). Since its establishment, the Senate Arms Sales and Manufacturing Investigation Committee, chaired by Nye, has strictly implemented the investigation work it has undertaken. The bill it has proposed is based on the public opinion created by the work of the committee, so it is naturally full of severity. (5th Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>US Supreme Court to Announce Verdicts in Three Lawsuits</h3>
<p>All Related to Government Policies</p>
<p>Washington - When the US Supreme Court opens today, it may announce the verdicts in the following three lawsuits, all of which are closely related to government policies. One is the Hoosac Mills case. The lower court previously ruled that the government had no right to control agricultural production and that the processing tax was illegal. The government refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The second is the Louisiana Grain Mill's request to prevent the government from collecting processing taxes. The third is the Penhaud case on whether the cotton control law is valid or not. According to legal experts, the processing tax will be ruled illegal. If so, the Roosevelt government will suffer a major blow and it will be necessary to find another way to collect new taxes. If the court overturns the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, Congress will be greatly shaken, and the registration of the Penhaud law will make the cotton control process more difficult to implement and will disrupt the cotton market.

<h3>East Hebei Issue: China and Japan Prepare for Negotiations</h3>

<h3>Yin's Rebellion Expands Military Strength</h3>
<p>Reorganizing the Security Team into the Pseudo-Fifth Division. Pseudo-Soldiers Rampant on the Beiping-Yuguan Express Train</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The East Hebei Puppet Autonomous Association has been reorganized into the Pseudo-Anti-Communist Autonomous Government. All scales are being expanded in an effort to show externally that it has independent and sound conditions. In terms of the army, the name has also been changed. The original Wartime Security First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth General Teams have all been renamed the Pseudo-East Hebei Anti-Communist Army First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Divisions. The originally appointed Security General Team Leaders Zhang Qingyu, Zhang Yantian, Li Haitian, Zhao Lei, and Li Yunsheng have been appointed as the division commanders of the various pseudo-divisions. The security team originally wore blue uniforms. Starting last week, they changed to gray military uniforms. The collar badges are inlaid with the two bronze characters "East Hebei" and the symbols of the pseudo-division and regiment. Each pseudo-division has jurisdiction over two regiments, and each regiment has three battalions, with 480 officers and soldiers in each battalion. Except for Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian's units, whose numbers and formations have not changed significantly, Li Haitian, Zhao Lei, and Li Yunsheng's three units have each recruited two large teams and reorganized them into two battalions in order to achieve uniform formation. Under the Pseudo-East Hebei Anti-Communist Government, there is a Pseudo-Security Department, headed by Dong Fengxiang, who is directly under the command of the rebellious Yin Rugeng and handles military affairs. The Pseudo-Security Department is located in Tangshan and was established on New Year's Day. The original 2,000-member militia in Luan County, which was forcibly trained by Liu Zuo Zhou when he served as the commander of the Third Wartime Security General Team, is now reorganized into a mixed brigade by the rebellious Yin, with Liu Runyuan appointed as the pseudo-brigade commander. The brigade has a total of two regiments, with Ning Yushi as the commander of the First Regiment and Xiao Fengwu as the commander of the Second Regiment, supervised by Li Haitian. Before the New Year, they were concentrated in Tangshan and Luan County, and uniforms were distributed after a roll call. On the 28th and 29th days of the twelfth lunar month, they were separately stationed in Qinhuangdao, Haiyangzhen, Shihe, Xinhe, Tanggu, Lutai, Ninghe, and other places. Recently, in order to suppress the people in various counties, the pseudo-government has ordered the various pseudo-county heads to recruit able-bodied men and organize them into standing-by regiments to strengthen their strength. However, the various counties have long been impoverished. Since the pseudo-organization was realized last year, the able-bodied men have been afraid of disaster and have fled abroad. Recruitment has been very difficult, so they have all reported back, requesting a postponement. Since the Pseudo-East Hebei Government expanded its army, each pseudo-division has hired foreign instructors and foreign personnel as staff officers, which is the same as the military system of the Pseudo-Manchukuo. Once the officers and soldiers of each pseudo-division are trained by foreign instructors, they immediately feel invincible. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, three soldiers of the Pseudo-Third Division Li Haitian's unit forcibly stopped the Beiping-Yuguan special express train and injured eight people. The details are as follows: On the afternoon of the 2nd, at about 5:00 PM, the Third Special Beiping-Yuguan Express Train of the Beiping-Shenyang Railway departed from Pingdong. When it arrived near Douzhangzhuang Station, because it was a special express train, it was not scheduled to stop at that station. Unexpectedly, at that time, three soldiers of the Pseudo-East Hebei Anti-Communist Army Third Division Li Haitian's unit, wearing gray uniforms, broke into the dining car and forced the train conductor Chen Tiqiang to stop the train at that station so that they could get off. The train conductor did not allow it, and a dispute occurred. The three soldiers beat Chen relentlessly. People in the dining car tried to dissuade them, and the train conductor managed to escape. He then notified the railway protection team in the car to take action. The railway protection team then coordinated with the Japanese military police in the car to go to the dining car to mediate. The three soldiers, relying on their strength, insisted on their claim and demanded that the train stop. The Japanese military police intended to arrest them, but the three soldiers drew their guns and fired dozens of shots. The order in the dining car was thrown into chaos. The time was 5:21 PM. The train had passed Douzhangzhuang and was about to arrive at Beidaihe. The three soldiers jumped off the train at the flag-waving point outside the station and fled. When the train arrived at Beidaihe Station, the railway protection team and the Japanese military police surrounded Dining Car No. 151 and searched it, but found nothing. This delayed the train by half an hour. It continued eastward and arrived at Shanhaiguan Station, where the Japanese military police at the station thoroughly searched the passengers in each section of the car, but also found nothing. When the pseudo-soldiers opened fire in the dining car, eight people were wounded, including: Squad Leader Bao Heting of the Fourth Railway Protection Team; a Japanese military policeman who was seriously injured and unable to speak; Japanese military police secret agent Su Qiaohua; Li Junqing; Japanese traveler Shimono Haranaga; Wang Zhiping, an inspector in the dining car, who was seriously injured and unable to speak; Yang Songmao, an accountant in the dining car; and a passenger surnamed Han. All the injured were sent to the Shanhaiguan Railway Hospital for treatment. The Japanese side believes that this incident has a background and is investigating it. (4th)</p>

<h3>Fuzhou: Commercial Decline Last Year</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Becomes an Import-Surplus Port: Foreign Trade Declines in All Sectors</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Of the commercial ports in Fujian Province, there are only two: Fuzhou and Xiamen. Goods from northeastern Fujian enter and exit through Fuzhou, while goods from southwestern Fujian enter and exit through Xiamen. However, Fuzhou has always been an export-surplus port, while Xiamen has always been an import-surplus port. Last year, Fuzhou's exports decreased significantly, turning it into an import-surplus port, which has attracted great attention from economists. The following is a detailed account of Fuzhou's commercial decline last year:</p>
<p>Tea: Tea is the largest export commodity in Fujian Province, produced in Jian'ou, Chong'an, Zhenghe, and Pucheng counties in northern Fujian, as well as Fu'an, Fuding, Ningde, Xiapu, and Shouning counties in eastern Fujian. It is mostly sold to various European and American countries, as well as provinces in northern and northeastern China. In the past, the value of exports was over ten million yuan annually. However, due to competition from tea produced in India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), sales have been declining since the tenth year of the Republic (1921). Furthermore, tea merchants are stuck in their old ways and cling to outdated methods, making it even more difficult to compete with foreign teas. In recent years, domestic tea production has increased year by year. After the Northeast Incident, customs duties were levied, increasing costs, and sales declined accordingly. Sales in northern China have also decreased year by year. European and American countries, due to the low price of Japanese tea, make it impossible for Chinese tea to compete. Last year, exports were only over four million yuan. Fortunately, the red and green teas and white tips produced in this province have a natural fragrance and aroma that are favored by many foreigners, so international trade has not been completely cut off. However, last year, the tea merchants' first batch of tea purchased in the early spring, while still being processed, saw prices in the sales areas fall by about eight taels per dan (unit of weight). All tea warehouses suffered heavy losses, and several went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Fir Wood: Fir wood is also a major export commodity in Fujian Province. Purchasers include the "Eight Gangs" of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, as well as the "Five Gangs" of Tiantai and Changwu, who transport and sell it to Zhejiang, Tianjin, the Yangtze River region, and Taiwan. In the past, sales were also over ten million yuan. Now, because foreign wood prices are lower than those of Chinese fir wood, sales have decreased. Wood merchants in various counties in northern Fujian who cut and raft logs to the province have suffered losses due to low selling prices. Even the fir wood businesses in this city have mostly announced their closure. Last year, exports were only worth over three million yuan.</p>
<p>Paper: Paper produced in various counties in northern Fujian is mostly sold to various ports in northern China and the four northeastern provinces, with annual sales of two to three million yuan. Since the northeastern territories no longer belong to us, they have also begun to imitate and produce low-priced paper for dumping sales. When Fujian paper is transported to those areas, it must also pay customs duties, adding to the burden and making it even more difficult to compete. Sales in the northeast have almost completely stopped, and northern China has also been affected. Businesses in this city that deal in paper have suffered huge losses. With sales declining, many paper mills in the mountains have also closed down. Last year, exports were only seven to eight hundred thousand yuan. Sales in northern China remain very sluggish. However, last month, the selling price of sea paper increased slightly by a few points per piece.</p>
<p>Bamboo Shoots: Bamboo shoots are produced in various counties in northern Fujian. In late autumn and early winter, bamboo shoots begin to grow from the bamboo roots, but in small quantities. These are mostly transported as fresh bamboo shoots to Shanghai, Tianjin and other ports for sale. By late winter and early spring, the production quantity increases, so they are dried and made into "magnolia slices". In the spring, when production is extremely high, they are dried and made into dried bamboo shoots, priced at over ten to twenty yuan per hundred catties. Last year, due to floods in various places, purchasing power weakened, prices fell by 20%, and sales decreased significantly. Total sales for the year were less than three hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Lacquerware: The "Shen Shao'an" brand is the oldest and produces the best products. Sales are very smooth, with exports to various provinces, the South Seas islands, and European and American countries. At its peak, annual sales were over one million yuan. In recent years, affected by the international financial crunch and the commercial decline of the South Seas islands, sales have sharply decreased year after year. Currently, annual sales are only over two hundred thousand yuan. Last year, participating in sales at the Qingdao Iron Exhibition, the Jiangsu National Exhibition, and the Taiwan Exposition yielded over fifty thousand yuan in total. Lacquerware merchants believe that this has brought some benefits.</p>
<p>Paper Umbrellas: Since the reform in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), exports to the South Seas islands have reached over one million yuan annually. However, since the tenth year of the Republic (1921), the economy of the South Seas has declined, and sales have been decreasing. In order to compete, umbrella merchants have been undercutting each other, using inferior products to make up the numbers, and their reputation has declined. Sales are only four to five hundred thousand yuan. Last year, the industry and commerce sector automatically banned the use of kraft paper to make umbrellas, hoping to restore foreign trade. Relevant parties jointly formed a paper umbrella export inspection agency to ensure credibility. Currently, there are only a few paper umbrella merchants purchasing for export, such as Wu Jingji and Jinshan Trading Company.</p>
<p>Horn Combs: Horn comb products are mostly sold to the South Seas. Before the first year of the Republic (1912), annual sales could reach over two hundred thousand yuan. In recent years, affected by chemically manufactured products, businesses in this city, such as Zou Zhenji and Run Guanghou, have also worked hard to improve their products, making them very beautiful. However, because the price is higher than that of chemical products, it is difficult to compete, resulting in a daily decrease in sales. Last year, sales were less than fifty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Bamboo Strips: Most of the bamboo strips are transported to northern China and resold to the northeast. In the past, annual sales were three to four hundred thousand yuan. Before the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), they were still around two hundred thousand yuan. Since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), sales have been greatly affected. Currently, annual sales are less than tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Embroidery: Fujian Province's embroidery products are still of good quality, and are sold domestically and abroad. The annual amount is about one hundred thousand yuan. In recent years, sales in various provinces have almost been cut off, and sales in the South Seas islands overseas have also decreased sharply. Recently, annual production has only been over thirty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Antiques: The "original head" antiques made in Shuimen, outside the South Gate, and behind the Governor-General's mansion are exquisitely crafted and artistically decorated, and are very popular in European and American countries and the South Seas islands. In the past, annual exports were estimated at over three hundred thousand yuan. Many people have started their businesses in this industry. In recent years, affected by the economic downturn, sales are only five to six hundred thousand yuan. More than half of the antique shops have closed down. (January 4th)</p>
<h3>Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou: Smuggling of Sugar Becomes More Prevalent</h3>
<p>Customs Has No Formal Sugar Imports: Customs Duty Losses Reach 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the increase in sugar import duties, the smuggling of sugar into Xiamen has become more prevalent. Sugar is a daily necessity. Although Fujian Province was originally a sugar-producing region, it has been suppressed by foreign sugar for decades, and the local sugar industry has been completely destroyed. It has no choice but to rely on foreign sugar. At the same time, Taiwan, separated by a narrow strip of water, has seen its sugarcane production increase year by year. Its primary outlet for sales is Fujian Province. The coastal ports of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen are numerous, and smuggling can be done by sailboats or small steamers and can enter anywhere. Currently, the sugar needed daily in the markets of Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou is all smuggled sugar that has not been formally imported. This has become an open secret. From November to the end of December last year, the Xiamen Customs had absolutely no formal declarations and tax payments for imported sugar. In December, the Customs seized ten batches of smuggled sugar, totaling 925 bags. Of these, 100 bags that were soaked and broken were auctioned in Xiamen, and the remaining 800 bags were shipped to Shanghai for auction. It is also reported that over 310 bags were smuggled into Xiamen, declared to the sugar tax bureau but not to the Customs. This is the situation of sugar smuggling in December. It is estimated that a total of over 5,000 bags of smuggled sugar were imported in the three months of October, November, and December. Each bag is estimated to weigh 166 catties, and the customs duty should be 23.6 yuan. Therefore, the loss of customs revenue from these 5,000 bags of smuggled sugar alone is no less than 120,000 yuan. Currently, smuggled sugar is sold for over 18 yuan per hundred catties in Zhangzhou, over 17 yuan in Quanzhou, and 20.02 yuan in Xiamen. If formally imported with tax payment, it would have to be sold for at least 23 yuan per hundred catties, a difference of over 6 yuan to over 3 yuan. No one dares to formally import sugar, which explains why there have been no formal declarations for imported sugar since November. The foreign sugar imported into Xiamen was sold in this city and transported to the Zhangma and Quanzhou areas. Recently, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Shima all sell smuggled sugar. The white sugar sold in Zhangzhou is all imported from the old towns along the coast of Zhangpu County. In Quanzhou, it is imported from ports such as Shenhu. In Xiamen, it is smuggled in along the island, with no fixed location. (January 4th)</p>
<h3>Southern Fujian Huian County: Malignant Malaria Is Rampant</h3>
<p>The Most Severe Transmission Is in Northern Huian: More Than 20,000 Patients</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, malaria has been prevalent in Huian County, Quanzhou, especially in northern Huian. The most severe areas are the fifth, fourth, eighth, and ninth Lianbao districts. According to local doctors, 19 out of 10 cases are malignant malaria. At the onset, most patients are in a coma and deep sleep, with various inflammatory attacks. Wealthy families mostly hire Western doctors for diagnosis and treatment, receiving injections and medications to recover. Those who cannot afford medical care buy quinine and Western medicine for one or two jiao to take, or take other Chinese medicines. Some also boil and take "cold frost" (local name for Huian herbs, harvested in winter) and various grass roots. Some recover, while others become severely ill and die, as they are sick without medical care. According to investigations, there are over 420 patients in the fourth Lianbao district, over 280 in the eighth Lianbao district, over 220 in Houcuo Township, over 70 in Waikeng, over 60 in Houzhai, over 340 in Andou, over 170 in Chaolin, over 180 in Tiandun, over 200 in Liushan, Wubian, and Yulin townships, over 370 in Dongzhuang Shebao, Xialongwei, and Xigu townships, over 90 in Xiwu, and over 350 in Gangqian, Hongku, and Wenban Hushi townships. In the ninth Lianbao district, there are over 300 patients in Qianhuang Township, over 150 in Xihuang, over 350 in Sanzhu, over 200 in Puan, over 240 in Zhongcuo, and over 120 in Yecuo. In the Shanyao area, it was first discovered in November, and the transmission is extremely rapid. In townships such as Guocuo, Sanchen, and Linbing, patients account for almost 70-80% of the population. There are no fewer than 20,000 patients in northern Huian. Over 160 people have died. The Huian County Relief Association is making every effort to treat the patients, but due to financial difficulties, they only have over 90 quinine pills, which is insufficient. Recently, the spread has become more severe. Because southern Fujian is in the subtropical zone, mosquitoes and gnats do not die in winter, and even breed more. The disease vectors are everywhere, so the transmission is rapid and widespread. The Huian County Government has sent a message to the provincial government, requesting immediate relief. The Huian County Party Department has also submitted a request to the Provincial Party Department, asking them to forward it to the Central Health Administration, requesting them to send medical personnel to Huian for treatment and epidemic prevention as soon as possible.

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Business Group's Cross-Border Fundraising Negotiation</p>
<p>Dong Jianzhi, the leader of the first team of the fourth branch of the Suzhou Business Group, has recently dispatched a large number of members to various places in the city to raise funds. On the 5th, two members went to Kongfu Si Lane in Fengmen to raise funds from door to door, stipulating a minimum amount of five jiao per person. Residents in that area were dissatisfied because the fourth branch was located in the east, west, and central markets of Lumen, so why were they fundraising here? A misunderstanding occurred. After mediation by Liu Xintang, the patrol officer of the jurisdiction, the members were persuaded to leave. At 10 p.m. that night, Dong Jianzhi led over 20 members, armed with live ammunition, to the Second Public Security Bureau to question Huang Tianyi, the chief of the bureau, demanding that Huang Tianyi prove that the members of the branch had not extorted donations. After Huang Tianyi telegraphed Liu Xintang, negotiations lasted for two hours before Huang Tianyi verbally proved that there was no extortion. The members then returned in formation. However, when the members arrived at the Second Bureau, nearby residents panicked. The Second Bureau dispatched police to explain the reason to dispel the misunderstanding. The various branches of the Suzhou Business Group will express their views on Dong's cross-border fundraising within a few days. Ji Houbai, the head of the general group, sent someone on the 6th to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Last Year's Total Production and Sales of Factory Silk</p>
<p>Wuxi was originally the richest area for silk production. In recent years, under the oppression of Japanese silk, the silk cocoon industry was on the verge of bankruptcy. In the autumn of last year, European and American silk sales were active, and the market rose sharply, and the silk cocoon industry has become prosperous. After winter, the silk market slumped. However, the total amount of factory silk produced, sold, and transported throughout the year has broken the record of the last four years. For twelve months of the year, the factory silk packed and transported by freight cars to Shanghai for export totaled more than 33,100 packages. More than 500 packages were loaded and transported by passenger cars. There are still a few that were shipped to Shanghai by small boats. Of these, foreign sales to Europe and the United States accounted for 90%, while user silk used by domestic silk factories accounted for only 10%.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Department Inspection Team Arrives in Changzhou</p>
<p>In order to improve the effectiveness of the secondary school achievement exhibition, the Jiangsu Education Department designated Gong Guanglang, Gu Yizhang, Zhou Bowen, and Zhang Zhukun to form an inspection team for the secondary school achievement exhibition. According to the convenience of the inspection route, the dates for the achievement exhibition of each school were determined and notified five days before departure. The inspection team departed from the province and arrived in Changzhou on the 5th. The provincial Changzhou Middle School achievement exhibition was held on the same day. The inspection team went to inspect it separately. The achievement exhibitions of other county-run and private secondary schools will be held from the 6th. The inspectors will also visit the schools separately for inspection. If they are completed within a few days, they will leave Changzhou for Zhenjiang and then to Yangzhou for inspection.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Demolition of Warehouse Resolved Through Mediation</p>
<p>In the case of Xiong Zhugao, the Director of the Education Bureau, demolishing the county's food management warehouse, the food committee members Zhu Danqing, Gu Haojia, etc., telegraphed the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Education Department, requesting that they send someone to investigate, order Director Xiong to restore the demolished parts to their original state, and severely punish him. Chen, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Yu and Zhou, the two directors of the Department of Civil Affairs and Education, issued a joint telegram, ordering Yan, the county magistrate, to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation within three days of receiving the telegram. Subsequently, Zhang, the special commissioner of the County Party Department, and Wang Nianhang, the Director of the Relief Institute, stepped in to mediate. All demolished items will be repaired by the Education Bureau at its own expense, restored to their original appearance, and returned to the Food Committee. It is reported that the Food Committee has accepted the mediation.</p>

<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The Internal Trade Strike Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Because the Xiaoshan fresh meat industry resisted paying education donations, all managers were meeting at the Chamber of Commerce when the county government found out and ordered them to be summoned to the county for detention. Two people were detained, and the remaining directors voluntarily went in for detention, totaling seven people. On the night of the 31st of last month, and the next day, they had not yet been released, so all eleven meat and fish shops in the urban area went on strike. The matter was about to escalate. The remaining merchants were preparing to go on strike to provide support. On the afternoon of the 4th, representatives from all industries went to the province to petition. Jin Shunquan, the manager of the bank, stepped forward to mediate. They telephoned the government to release the detainees, and the donations for education will be discussed later. The meat industry strike came to an end.</p>
<h3>Special Education Broadcast - The Trend of Normal School Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chang Daozhi, Head of the Education Department, Central University</p>
<p>Since the last World War, whether it was the thoroughly reformed Soviet Union, the partially reformed Germany and Italy, or the England and France that勉維持 their current state, their education systems and philosophies have undergone a revolution or correction; among them, the reform of normal school education occupies a very important position. We have repeatedly seen from modern history that after a country encounters extraordinary changes, its entire political, economic, and cultural rejuvenation movement is often accompanied by a new education plan, and in this entire plan, normal school education is often regarded as the key to realizing this new plan. In peaceful times, modern countries seem to pay more attention to the education of children from the upper classes of society, and only when they encounter the life-and-death juncture of "national competition" are they forced to do their best to popularize education among the broad masses of people. A review of the history of popular education in modern countries will confirm that modern normal school institutions were established specifically to train teachers for this type of elementary education.</p>
<p>Since normal school education arose in response to the need for universal elementary education, its organizational form and training content must depend on the nature and function of elementary education. To understand the essence of modern normal school education and its recent trends, we must first explain this point.</p>
<p>Originally, before the World War, the school systems of European countries mostly adopted a dual-track system: all public elementary schools, whose primary purpose was to popularize elementary education, were established for the children of the lower classes of society; as for children from aristocratic and wealthy families, they generally went through private or public preparatory schools, then secondary schools, and then universities. The two had different paths and did not interfere with each other, hence the name "dual-track system." At that time, the government believed that ordinary people only needed to be taught basic literacy and numeracy skills, and to develop habits of loyalty, piety, and diligence; therefore, teachers in these schools only needed to possess the knowledge and skills to teach these simple skills, and everything was considered satisfactory. The Pupil Teacher System adopted by England in 1846 can serve as an example. According to this system, anyone who aspired to become a primary school teacher could, at the age of thirteen, sign a five-year contract with the chief teacher of an elementary school, learning teaching skills from them and supplementing their general knowledge. This system, in form and spirit, completely followed the apprenticeship system prevalent in the industrial and commercial sectors. The knowledge and vision of teachers produced by this system would never exceed the scope required by general elementary schools.</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, the governments of European countries, which were politically inclined towards conservatism, believed that the curriculum of normal schools, exceeding the minimum required for teaching in elementary schools, was not only unnecessary but also harmful. The report of the Education Committee of the Provisional Government of France in 1848 criticized the curriculum content of normal schools at that time for being higher than the level required for general elementary school teachers, and believed that such training was not suitable for the narrow and mundane duties of rural school teachers; and said, "They will inevitably, out of dissatisfaction with the status quo, tend towards extremely dangerous political and social ideals." The committee believed that the ideal teacher should always be "simple in thought, diligent, and his needs should be as limited as his desires; for him, his students and his hometown are his entire world."</p>
<p>Similarly, the Prussian government, since 1840, in addition to making efforts to suppress political and religious heresies, also oppressed normal colleges. The authorities believed that the turmoil in general society and the education sector at that time was caused by the normal college curriculum being too advanced; "The ambition caused by the curriculum being too advanced has no possibility of realization, so they feel dissatisfied with their current position; and incite others to also feel dissatisfied." Based on this reason, they planned to greatly restrict the curriculum of normal schools. In 1844, the government issued an order prohibiting normal school students from arbitrarily and unsupervised browsing of the library's collection of books, so as not to distract their attention, and ordered supervisors to pay special attention to the list of books read by students. Everything was exactly the same as what France expressed.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, there was also a common point in normal school education in European countries, that is, the students of normal schools were mainly recruited from primary school graduates. As mentioned earlier, in countries with a dual-track school system, primary schools were established for the children of the lower classes of society, so the students admitted to normal schools could not escape this range. As a result, a "class policy" was unintentionally formed; that is, the students and teachers of primary schools were often from the same social class. The entire set of elementary education, from elementary primary school, to higher primary school (or normal school preparatory course), to normal school undergraduate course, formed a system; after passing through all the stages of the entire system, they returned to primary school to teach, forming a cycle. Here are some examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>France: The admission qualification for the current normal school is usually the completion of the ordinary course of higher primary school, three years; the higher primary school ordinary course can be regarded as a normal school preparatory course, and the admission qualification is an age of at least twelve years and a primary primary school certificate.</p>
<p>Germany: The old normal school students were recorded from graduates who completed eight years of national primary school, first entering the preparatory course for three years, and then entering the normal college for three years.</p>
<p>The academic courses studied by normal school students are entirely based on the needs of primary school teaching, so although the length of education they experience is sometimes longer than that of general secondary schools, because they have no preparation and research for advanced academics, there is actually little opportunity to enter university. In countries that implement this type of normal school system, their normal schools and primary schools are under the same competent department in the national education administrative agency. For example, the schools managed by the Elementary Education Department of the French Ministry of Education include kindergarten schools, elementary primary schools, higher primary schools, normal schools, and higher elementary normal schools for training normal school teachers (there are two in total, one for men and one for women, which should not be confused with the higher normal schools for training secondary school teachers), forming the entire elementary education into an independent and self-sufficient system, which can be regarded as being貫澈through to the extreme in France.</p>
<p>The normal school education organizations of France and Germany mentioned above can be regarded as representative systems of the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, far-sighted educators and educational organizations in various countries have gradually expressed their dissatisfaction with the current education system; at the same time, the shift in social, political and economic situations has also fundamentally changed the original concept of elementary education. In general, the differences between modern elementary school education and that before the European War can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The aforementioned primary school was exclusively for the lower classes of society, while the modern primary school is gradually becoming a stage of common life that all citizens must experience before receiving individually differentiated education according to their aspirations, abilities, and interests.</p>
<p>The aforementioned primary school intentionally or unintentionally became a tool to maintain the division of the existing social classes, while the modern primary school deliberately gathers children from various social classes in one hall, taking advantage of the fact that their class consciousness has not yet formed, to jointly operate a cooperative life to develop their spirit of unity of mind and purpose, which is the most effective means to eliminate the boundaries of human classes.</p>
<p>The former primary school aimed to impart basic knowledge and skills to citizens and create a docile and easy-to-use population, while the modern primary school aims to correct the foundation of children's physical, moral, and intellectual education.</p>
<p>From the above new concept of primary school education, naturally arises the requirement for a new type of teacher. In other words, to enable modern primary schools to undertake this new mission, we must start with training teachers of the new era. The following first lists the general outlines of the current normal school systems in various countries, and then summarizes the special spirit they express, in order to indicate the general trend of modern normal school education.</p>
<p>The elementary school teacher training institutions in modern countries, according to their position in the entire school system, some still have not been able to escape the stage of secondary education, while others have advanced to the ranks of higher institutions: the former includes countries such as France, Italy, and Russia, and the latter includes countries such as England and Germany: American normal schools also tend to require complete secondary school graduation as a necessary qualification for admission, which seems to be quite similar to the current systems in England and Germany, but the level of American secondary schools is usually lower than that of European secondary schools, so its normal schools have not yet been able to compete with the teacher training institutions of England and Germany. The following will list the outlines of their current systems one by one:</p>
<p>France: The current normal school education system has been mentioned earlier. Those who complete the normal school curriculum, pass the graduation examination, and are qualified as probationary teachers or temporary teachers, after two years, pass the examination for the education qualification certificate, and then they can be appointed as formal teachers.</p>
<p>Italy: The study period of the Teachers College is a total of seven years: the junior course of four years is the nature of the normal school preparatory course, and the senior course of three years is the normal school undergraduate course. The admission level of the junior course is primary school, completed in four years. Anyone who completes the senior course of the Teachers College and passes the graduation examination can receive the elementary school teacher qualification certificate, but to obtain formal employment, they must pass a competitive examination, and after passing, they must serve as a probationary teacher for three years, and be recommended by the supervisor to be a正敎yuan formal teacher.</p>
<p>Soviet Union: The main training institution for primary school (ie, the so-called "four-year school") teachers is the Education College, with admission qualifications of "seven-year school" (approximately the first four years of primary school and the first three years of junior high school). The study period is set at four years. During the first five-year plan, due to the rapid expansion of primary schools, teacher supply could not meet the demand, so many two-week and one-month short-term training classes had to be set up. It is said that those who enter these short-term courses often have formal education that does not exceed the level of "four-year school".</p>
<p>United States: The institutions and methods for training primary school teachers are quite complex, and their levels are also very uneven. Generally, the training places for teachers in rural primary schools are mostly teacher training departments attached to middle schools, but the training received by teachers in urban primary schools is obviously more complete. Since 1920, the trend has been to take secondary school graduation plus two years of normal school training as the minimum standard, and its institutions are state-owned, county-owned, city-owned, or private normal schools and teachers colleges.</p>
<p>England: The teacher training institutions for primary schools are independently established training colleges and training departments affiliated to universities. The admission qualification for training colleges is the completion of the secondary school curriculum, passing the first examination of secondary school and reaching the age of eighteen, and the admission qualification for university training departments must be seventeen years of age, passing the university entrance examination or passing the secondary school first examination with scores sufficient to exempt them from the university entrance examination. The latter has slightly stricter admission qualifications. The study period of the training college is two years: those who complete the prescribed academic program, pass the examination, and whose actual teaching ability is deemed satisfactory by the inspector of the Ministry of Education, can receive a certificate, and after a one-year probationary period, they can be recognized as "certified teachers". The study period of the university training department is four years in total; the first three years are devoted to studying the courses necessary for a university degree, and the last year is devoted to professional training. The entire academic program is completed and the university conducts the final examination. Those who pass this examination are awarded an education certificate, which holders can use to obtain an elementary school teacher diploma, if the examinee has already obtained practical experience in elementary school teaching.</p>
<p>Germany: According to Article 143 of the Federal Constitution of 1919, "The teacher training method shall always be based on the general principles suitable for higher education, and shall be uniformly stipulated nationwide," this is the准據basis for the transformation of the normal school system in various states of Germany after the欧仗 European War. According to the meaning of the constitutional provisions, the admission level of teacher training institutions should be equal to the admission level of general universities, but whether this institution should be a constituent part of the university or an independently established institution of higher learning, the methods of each state are slightly different. In the two states of Prussia and Bavaria, two-year independent education colleges were established (apdagrgische　Akademie, renamed Teacher University Hochschnle　　urLehrerbildung in 1933), while Hamburg completely incorporated them into the university and became a constituent part of it; the method of the Saxon state is between the two, with the academic part handled by the university and the professional training by the independently established Education Research Institute. In the current Prussian system, the Teacher University completes the study period with the "First Teacher Examination". Those who pass this examination can serve as "probationary teachers". Those who wish to obtain a permanent appointment must take the "Second Teacher Examination" within a period of two to four years of service. The training period for teachers in Saxony is set at three years, and its institutions are Leipzig University, Dresdent Technical University, and the Education Research Institute specially set up in the two cities; the university is responsible for setting up academic subjects, and the Education Research Institute is engaged in training in educational theory and practice.</p>

<h3>Europe-Asia's Third Giant Aircraft - Flew to Xi'an This Morning</h3>
<p>Aircraft No. 16 Was Transported from Changshu to Shanghai</p>
<p>The third Junkers-type three-engine giant aircraft that the Europe-Asia Airlines continued to lease from the German Lufthansa Airlines, after flying to Longhua at 4:00 pm on December 20 last year, sent workers the next day to inspect the machinery and repaint the party flag and company logo, which has been completely completed. It is now known that the aircraft has now been decided to join the Shanghai-Xinjiang and Shaanxi-Rong lines for service, and is scheduled to make its first flight from Shanghai to Xi'an at 7:00 am this morning. As for the German pilots who drove to China, such as Duchs, and four others, they are currently waiting for a ship to return home.</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 16 flew from Shanghai to Qin Prefecture in southern Shaanxi with passengers on December 23 last year. After the event, it returned to Shanghai via Zhengzhou, Nanjing and other places on the 25th. It was stranded in Changshu County.

<h3>Europe-Asia Airlines Approved to Plan - Preparing to Open the Beijing-Yunnan Line</h3>
<p>Determined to Restore the Ping-Yue Line This Spring - And Expand the Business of the Shanghai-Xinjiang Line</p>
<p>The Europe-Asia Airlines' plan to develop the aviation industry this year has been actively carried out since January. In addition to restoring the aviation business on the Ping-Yue and expanding the Shanghai-Xinjiang lines, it has also been approved by the Ministry of Communications to plan the Beijing-Yunnan line. According to Secretary Cha Zhenhu and the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency, the situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Restoring the Ping-Yue Route</p>
<p>The Europe-Asia's establishment of the Ping-Yue line was due to the suspension of the Lanzhou-West section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang line. In 1934, it applied for suspension and changed the plan, changing the Ping-Shaanxi line and the Yue-Shaanxi line to the Ping-Yue line. The entire line runs from Ping to Yue, via Zhengzhou, Hankou, Changsha to Guangzhou. Currently, the company plans to restore this line in the spring to facilitate North-South transportation.</p>
<p>Expanding Shanghai-Xinjiang Business</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Xinjiang route has been officially opened to traffic since April 1932. In June, it was extended to Lanzhou. In December, the Lanzhou-Dihua section was successfully trial-operated. Due to the Xinjiang Incident, it failed to open to traffic. It was only officially opened to traffic in May 1933. In September, the Xinjiang Incident occurred again, and the journey west of Lanzhou was suspended again. However, the company believes that this line is the only main route and refuses to abandon it easily. Moreover, it is gradually expanding its business. Li Jingcong returned from inspecting the Shanghai-Xinjiang line on Sunday and decided to add the newly borrowed Ceikes giant aircraft to the route for test flights within days.</p>
<p>Newly Opened Beijing-Yunnan Route</p>
<p>Regarding the Europe-Asia Airlines' preparations for opening the Beijing-Yunnan route, this matter is one of the new planned routes and has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and is in the process of preparing for trial flights. According to Secretary Cha Zhenhu, this route is a direct route from Beijing to Yunnan. Currently, there is no guarantee for the future business of this route. It is necessary to wait for the trial flight. If the results are excellent, it will be officially opened for flights, and it can fly back and forth twice a week.</p>

<h3>Jiang Bocheng Has Not Left Shanghai for Guangdong</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a telegram from Hong Kong said that Mr. Jiang Bocheng, President Chiang's representative in Guangdong, has arrived in Guangdong and met with the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi. The Central News Agency reporter inquired at the Jiang residence yesterday morning. According to his family, Jiang is currently in Shanghai dealing with private affairs and has not left Shanghai for Guangdong. However, it is understood that Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, stationed in Nanjing, left Shanghai for Guangdong at the end of last year to pay respects to Chen and report on everything. The telegram from Hong Kong may have been a misunderstanding. Yang has been away from his hometown for a long time, so he will take the opportunity to go south to visit his hometown and return north at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Have Not Yet Used Japanese Currency, Requesting Approval from Japanese Consulate for Filing, Our Authorities Are Investigating</h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, in order to dump Japanese goods, the Japanese residents in this port, in conjunction with several Japanese banks and larger Japanese stores, organized a consortium to issue 100,000 yuan of Japanese paper money to circulate in the market, so that it can be freely used within the Japanese resident community. It was originally scheduled to be issued starting on New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic. However, because the consortium applied to the Japanese Consulate General for filing but did not receive approval, and because all the procedures have not yet been properly prepared, it was not implemented as scheduled. According to the Shin Shi News Agency reporter's inquiries with the Japanese residents, the Japanese residents are now planning to continue to apply to the Japanese Consulate General for approval to protect the issuance. For the benefit of the Japanese residents themselves, they will strive for this matter. On the one hand, they are still actively planning the issue of paper money. In any case, it is imperative. Our foreign affairs authorities have also joined forces with the municipal government to send personnel to investigate the truth in order to negotiate.</p>

<h3>New Telephone System in Special District to be Implemented, All Sectors to Hold Regular Consultations to Cope, Meeting to be Held at Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 10th of this Month</h3>
<p>The new telephone fee system in the special district, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Concession, will be implemented on March 1st. At a time when Shanghai's social economy is in a state of panic, it is very difficult for the citizens to accept it. The Telephone Issue Committee was responsible for handling the matter on December 16th of last year. Because the implementation period is approaching, the committee has decided to hold its first committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Friday) in the regular meeting room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Palace Bridge to discuss response measures. Yesterday, a notice was sent to all committee members and consultant members to attend on time. The notice stated, "Notice: The issue of telephone price increases in the special district has been repeatedly opposed by various organizations in this city, but to no avail. It has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Concession and will be implemented starting on March 1st. At a time when all industries are declining, the company is blatantly implementing it regardless of public interests, which is not in line with public opinion. Various organizations in this city held a joint meeting on December 16th of last year and decided to organize the Shanghai Special District Telephone Issue Committee to be responsible for handling the matter. Because the price increase period is approaching, a board meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Friday) in the regular meeting room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss response measures. We hereby request you to attend on time and discuss the progress together. Shanghai Special District Telephone Issue Committee."</p>

<h3>Director of Trademark Bureau, Chen Feishi, Calls Officials to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>Chen Feishi, Counselor of the Ministry of Industry and acting Director of the Trademark Bureau, assumed his duties on New Year's Day. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, at the memorial week of the bureau, Director Chen gave instructions to all the officials, saying that the exclusive right to use a trademark is one of the four major privileges. The responsibility of this bureau is to examine and approve and revoke the exclusive right to use a trademark. Article 39 of the Trademark Law and Article 40 of the Implementing Regulations have both substantive and procedural requirements. There is no other way except to follow the laws and regulations. In name, it is an administrative agency, but it actually has judicial characteristics. The laws and regulations have provisions for time limits, so cases should be closed quickly to avoid intangible losses to merchants' rights. The law has procedures for review and re-evaluation, so it should be based on legality. Do not be stubborn or show favoritism. As for myself and all colleagues, we should regard ourselves as judicial officials. All the norms that judicial officials should abide by, such as not interacting with the parties involved, etc., are probably already known and able to be followed by all colleagues. I would like to encourage each other with the two words "abide by the law."</p>
<h3>China Construction Bank Company Prepares, Real Estate Mortgage Loan Bank, Carefully Studying and Preparing Steps, All Industries Eagerly Await Early Establishment of the Bank</h3>
<p>Regarding the preparation for the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank, after the Ministry of Finance designated a special committee to prepare a plan and ordered the China Construction Bank Company to plan the establishment, the company's board of directors approved the principles in principle, and General Manager Song Ziliang is actively planning various preparatory matters. According to the reporter of the New News Agency, the company believes that the establishment of this bank is of great importance to the credibility of China and foreign countries, so it strives for thorough and perfect organization in order to consolidate the foundation. Currently, General Manager Song Ziliang and various experts of the company are carefully studying the steps for the establishment of this bank. In the near future, the Ministry of Finance will initiate a large amount of capital stock to enrich the bank's capital and facilitate the process. In the future, all matters related to the bank's capital accounting will be separated from the company and independent. According to a real estate tycoon who told the reporter of the New News Agency, the activity of real estate has a close relationship with the prosperity or decline of the market. Therefore, if we want to make the market fully active, the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank is a matter of urgency. Therefore, since the Ministry of Finance ordered the China Construction Bank Company to actively prepare for the establishment, all industries are eagerly awaiting the early establishment of the bank.</p>
<h3>Shallow Water in the Upper Yangtze River Makes Navigation in Hunan Difficult</h3>
<p>Various shipping companies in this port received a telegram from Hankou reporting that the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is receding very quickly, especially in the Xiang River. Ships from Hankou to Changsha, Hunan, can now only sail to Guanyin Island. Beyond this, the river water is shallow and the ships cannot pass upstream. The goods destined for Changsha and other places are all blocked at Guanyin Island. In order to facilitate the transportation of goods, various shipping companies have agreed on a method to send barges from Changsha to Guanyin Island to transship the goods, so as to avoid interrupting transportation. However, due to the shallow water, the transportation of goods from Shanghai to Hunan is very difficult.</p>
<h3>Foreign Military Supplies to China Must be Certified by Our Embassy, Military Department Consults with Ministry to Instruct Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it has long been stipulated in the passport regulations that military supplies transported to China from foreign countries must be certified by our embassy in the country of origin. However, it is inevitable that various agencies and companies will not comply with this procedure. The Ministry of Military Affairs has specially consulted with the Ministry of Communications to order its subordinate agencies to strictly crack down on this. The original text is as follows: "It has long been expressly stipulated in Article 11 of the Passport Regulations that military supplies transported to China from foreign countries must be certified by our embassy in the country of origin. However, various agencies, schools, troops, companies, and merchants purchasing and transporting military supplies to China without going through this certification procedure are still unavoidable. Since they have not complied with the laws and regulations, it is bound to have a significant impact on cracking down on the smuggling of military supplies. Strict measures should be taken to crack down on this. In addition to consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the embassies abroad to handle the matter conscientiously, and consulting with the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs offices to check whether the passports have been certified by our embassies abroad in the country of origin when verifying the passports, if any military supplies are found that have not been certified, regardless of whether they are for military or civilian use, they shall not be allowed to be imported and shall be detained and reported to the ministry for verification (this does not apply to shipments originating from Hong Kong and Dalian, where there are no Chinese consulates), and in addition to issuing instructions, we hereby consult with you for verification and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Association Ratifies Improvement of Registration Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' General Labor Union convened a joint meeting of representatives yesterday. 57 people were present, including Qian Youfu, Chen Hongji, and Xu Zhaoyuan. Chairman Chen Guoliang was elected as chairman, and Comrade Hu recorded the proceedings. After paying respects to the party and national flag, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that on December 22nd of last year, he had contacted Mr. Zhong Sijun, the General Manager of the Public Concession, to request the improvement of rickshaw puller registration, stipulating 10,000 magnetic cards for rickshaw pullers, running in parallel with vehicle numbers. The remaining mobile rickshaw pullers will take turns switching shifts, recognizing 10,000 magnetic cards based on the union's membership, in order to avoid abuses, prevent thieves from stealing vehicles, and save the livelihoods of new rickshaw pullers from Jiangbei. Ratified and approved. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association will be abolished, and rickshaw puller relief work should be handled by impartial organizations and rickshaw puller representatives themselves in order to seek the welfare of rickshaw pullers. It was decided to send another letter to the Municipal Federation of Taxpaying Chinese Associations to negotiate quickly. Regarding the problem of relieving unemployed rickshaw pullers, the weather is currently very cold, and many unemployed rickshaw pullers are displaced, without clothes or food, and many are freezing to death. In addition, the old Lunar New Year is approaching, and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers are difficult. The union should find ways to provide relief. As a result of the discussion, in addition to requesting philanthropists to provide cotton clothing and rice coupons for assistance and relief, the chairman was elected to contact the concession authorities and allocate funds from the relief fund to quickly purchase cotton clothing and rice coupons, which will be collected and distributed to truly poor rickshaw pullers at the union office at 276 Lanyueai Road, Liyuanfang. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Association Sent Refugees Back to Their Hometowns Yesterday</h3>
<p>The refugees who fled to Shanghai due to the floods previously, because the old Lunar New Year is approaching, are eager to return to their hometowns to visit, so they have asked the Flood Relief Association to issue travel expenses. The authorities of the Flood Relief Association dispatched Director-General Chen Youtang, Ge Yunxun, and staff member Wu Zengting yesterday to distribute free boat tickets to each refugee at the association's office, and sent personnel to escort them to the Sanbei Steamship Company's Sanbei ship, sending them back to their original hometowns in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, etc., totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Donation of 20,000 Yuan Sent to Flood Relief Association for Distribution</h3>

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Continues to Issue Relief Funds to Disaster Victims in Zhabei, First Conducting Mail Registration</h3>
<p>The previous fire insurance compensation fund for disaster areas was allocated 20,000 yuan by the Social Affairs Bureau last year and distributed by the association. Because auditing was very troublesome, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to issue it directly. In October of last year, mail registration was conducted for disaster victims who had already registered with the association but had not received the funds. Then, in December of the same year, personnel were sent to the Zhabei Charity Organization to distribute the funds according to the names of the households registered by mail. The procedure was very simple. It is now reported that the bureau is still considering the needs of disaster victims who have not received the previous relief funds, and it announced in the newspaper starting on New Year's Day of this year that it will conduct mail registration again, which will end on the 15th of this month, and will not be extended. At the same time, households will be notified, and the funds will be distributed at the Zhabei Charity Organization before the end of the old year. Disaster victims who have already registered with the association but have not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau by mail should quickly report to the Second Division of the bureau to declare their registration. Those who have already registered by mail with the bureau and the bureau believes that funds can be issued, but have not received the notification due to a change of address, can also submit a letter within the deadline stating the reason and indicating the current address to request a supplementary issuance. Failure to do so will be deemed as a waiver. Please do not delay.</p>
<h3>The United Benevolent Societies' Shanghai South Temporary Shelter: A Visit Report</h3>
<p>A report from the Guowen News Agency: The Shanghai South Temporary Shelter for Winter Relief for the Poor, since its opening, has accommodated over 3,100 people. To accommodate the increasing number of people, the staff has been working diligently. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, our reporter visited the shelter located within the Chaozhou Guildhall to inquire about the situation. We were received by Director Zhang Zixin and Secretary Wang Yisun of the association, who led us inside to observe the poor. We noted that, although these individuals are homeless and destitute commoners, the order was remarkably calm. Mr. Zhang and others provided a detailed account of the overall situation of the shelter, stating briefly that the temporary shelters are established every winter by a meeting of the Shanghai United Benevolent Societies, convened in response to a request from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and under the supervision of philanthropists such as Tong Hongwang, Wang Yiting, and Huang Hanzhi of the association. Following established practice, a shelter is set up in the Shanghai South area to accommodate the poor who are without clothing or food. This year, the shelter was opened earlier than usual in the Chaozhou Guildhall, and a second shelter was established at the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. In the initial stages of preparation, the association consulted with local gentry and merchants, including philanthropist Zhang Xiaoliang, to solicit a large quantity of lumber from major timber merchants, approximately 20,000 feet, and hired workers to construct sheds and other structures. The interior is divided into sections for management, accounting, general affairs, storage, provisions, reception, registration, inspection, and sanitation. The reception of the poor began as early as December 15th of last year, and the number of people accommodated has now reached over 3,170. With the sudden onset of cold weather, the influx is expected to increase. When the poor arrive at the shelter, they are first questioned in detail, and their age, origin, and occupation are recorded on a registration form. They are then given a token, instructed to shave their heads and bathe, and admitted to the shelter. They are then issued cotton clothing and examined for any signs of opium addiction or other illnesses, in which case they are sent to local opium addiction treatment centers or provided with opium cessation medication daily to help them quit, or sent to charitable hospitals for medical treatment. The poor are provided with three meals a day. In previous years, the meals consisted of two congees and one rice meal. This year, due to fundraising difficulties, the meals have been changed to three congees per day, with a small amount of vegetables. Each session requires about 1,000 shi of rice, which is procured on a voluntary basis by rice merchant leader Mr. Gu Xin Yi. In terms of management, the poor are divided into groups of twelve, with one of the more literate individuals appointed as the group leader. Two people share a bed in the sleeping quarters, and cotton blankets are fully distributed. During meals and rest, they must obey the instructions of the group leader and are managed by administrators in shifts. The poor children are given basic literacy instruction. Order is maintained by police officers dispatched by the Public Security Bureau. These poor and unemployed workers are provided with food, clothing, and warmth, and they remain peaceful and content as they weather the severe winter. Once the old lunar year ends and spring warms, they will be dispersed in batches, either leaving the shelter on their own to seek employment, or through arrangements with factories and shops to find work, or given funds or transportation tickets to return to their hometowns. The elderly, lonely, and helpless, or orphaned children, are sent to relevant charitable organizations for education and relief. The shelter's expenses have no fixed source of funding and rely entirely on temporary fundraising efforts. Currently, in addition to a subsidy of 2,000 yuan from the Municipal Government, over 10,000 yuan was collected by various charitable organizations at the previous meeting. Furthermore, Minister Kong contributed 2,000 yuan, the China and Foreign Relief Association donated 2,000 yuan, the flood relief associations of various provinces contributed 1,000 yuan, and enthusiastic donations of clothing, rice, and funds from various philanthropists have been received. Chairman Wang has been tirelessly fundraising to ensure a continuous supply, which is truly a blessing for the poor. Every effort is made to economize on all income and expenditures, and reports are prepared every ten days and submitted to the Chairman for review, with all expenses meticulously accounted for and transparency as the guiding principle, so that a report can be prepared at the end of the shelter's operation and submitted to all sectors of society for verification. The shelter aims for openness and hopes that all sectors of society will provide guidance and visit.</p>
<h3>Reduction and Exemption of Land Tax in Gaoqiao and Other Districts: One-Tenth Exemption Due to Disaster</h3>
<p>Last year, there was a prolonged drought in the summer, and the growth of cotton and rice was incomplete. In the autumn, there was continuous rain, and the cotton bolls and rice ears rotted, resulting in a sharp reduction in harvest and extreme hardship for farmers. In order to understand the situation, the Municipal Government specifically ordered the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Finance and Land Bureaus, to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections in the disaster areas and to discuss remedial measures based on the inspection results. It is understood that the disaster situation in Gaoqiao, Tangqiao, Yangsi, and Yangjing districts is similar, with losses ranging from more than 40% to less than 50%. Therefore, it has been decided to implement Article 6 of the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Reporting and Tax Reduction Regulations, which stipulates a one-tenth reduction in land tax to show compassion. This has already been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Labor Unions of Two Railways Telegraph for Prompt Payment of Year-End Bonuses</h3>
<p>The Council of the Trade Unions of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways, directly under the Ministry of Railways, has repeatedly received requests from various branch unions to forward them to the Railway Bureau, but no response has been received. Therefore, yesterday (the 6th) afternoon, the standing directors of the union, Zhao Yu and Yuan Qiaofu, and supervisor Yao Xiaojiang, presented a petition in person to the Director of the Bureau, requesting prompt disbursement, and telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to instruct the Railway Bureau to expedite the distribution of bonuses to reassure the workers. The original telegram is excerpted below: To Minister Zhang and Vice Minister Zeng of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing: The year-end bonuses for the 24th year of the Republic have not yet been announced. The union has previously received requests from its subordinate branches to forward them to the Railway Bureau for prompt distribution. The union has repeatedly forwarded these requests to the Railway Bureau, but no response has been received. With the Lunar New Year having passed and the closing of accounts approaching, the workers are urgently expecting bonuses to supplement their income. It is a universal expectation. We have also heard that bonuses have been distributed on other railways, but there is still no definite news on this railway, causing general anxiety among the workers. In addition to instructing our members to work with peace of mind and await official orders, we are specially telegraphing to Your Excellency, requesting that you instruct the Railway Bureau to expedite the distribution of bonuses to reassure the workers. We urgently submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. The Council of the Trade Unions of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways, directly under the Ministry of Railways, respectfully bows. Yu.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South and Minhang National Products Exhibitions Open on the Same Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, organized by the Municipal National Products Year Sports Meet, and the Minhang National Products Exhibition, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, held their opening ceremonies yesterday afternoon. Details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Shanghai South The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, organized by the Municipal National Products Year Sports Meet, held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the market of the Lujiagang Xiaocaichang Fangsheng Bureau. Over two hundred guests and representatives from various sectors, including Lin Kanghou of the All-China Federation of Commerce, Xu Xiaochu of the All-China Federation of New Medicine, Chen Jiufeng and Liu Zhongying of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, Tao Leqin of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, Ge Futian of the Nantong Fellow-Villagers Association, and Xu Chengde of the Tatuhu Vehicle Mutual Aid Association, were present. Lin Kanghou, Xu Xiaochu, and Wang Hanqiang served as the presidium. After the required ceremonies, Xu Xiaochu first reported, "The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition is organized by the Manufacturers' Association on behalf of the Municipal National Products Year. We are very honored to have everyone participating in today's opening ceremony. Although our country has been advocating for national products for many years, the general public's love for foreign goods has become a habit, and it is not possible to change this in a short period of time. Although the amount of imports has gradually decreased as a result of several years of promoting national products, the export of goods has not increased. Therefore, we, as manufacturers, should strive to improve the quality of our products in order to resist the sales of imported goods. At the same time, we hope that the Chinese people will strive to promote domestic goods." Then, the guests made speeches, and the chairmen accompanied them to visit the market. The participating manufacturers also opened for business at the same time.</p>
<p>Minhang The Minhang National Products Exhibition Hall, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, opened on New Year's Day. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a supplementary opening ceremony was held at the Minhang County Public Education Center. Over one hundred representatives from organizations such as the Manufacturers' Association, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai County Party Headquarters, the County Government, the County Education Bureau, the County Public Security Bureau, the County Farmers' Association, and the County Women's Association were present. Liu Zhongying served as the chairman. After the required ceremonies, the chairman first reported, "Ladies and gentlemen, the Minhang National Products Exhibition is unprecedented. Although our National Products Exhibition has only been open since New Year's Day, its sales performance has already broken the record of other National Products Exhibitions in the district. This proves the enthusiasm of the Minhang community for promoting national products. We are very pleased about this, and at the same time, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all sectors of society on behalf of the participating manufacturers. For years the promotion of national products has occurred, its result still is that imported goods exceed exports several times over. The reasons for this are divided into two categories: 1. The general, modern countrymen take pride in consuming foreign goods, indirectly serving as unpaid promoters of foreign goods. 2. Manufacturers are ignorant and simplistic, failing to improve the quality of their products. We should thoroughly reform this unhealthy mindset in the future in order to achieve national prosperity and strength."</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Auctions Inventory to Repay Creditors</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai National Products Company on Nanjing Road has been affected by the sluggish market. Since it suspended business on June 4th of last year, its founder, Wu Zhihao, has been running around to obtain the understanding of the creditors, and has received the assistance of prominent Shanghai figures Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhang Shouyong, Zhu Meixian, and Chen Zhonggao, who sympathize with Wu's goal of promoting national products to save the country and benefit the people. They have organized a National Products Revival Committee, which has been fully prepared and the interior has been completely arranged. It is reported that the company will resume business on the 9th of this month and auction its inventory to repay the creditors. All goods will be sold at discounts ranging from 10% to 40% of the original price. Such a cheap opportunity is rare and is truly a boon for patriotic ladies. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. It is also learned that after the company has completed the auction of its inventory and repaid its debts, it will recruit new shareholders and expand its business.</p>

<h3>Post Office Robbery Case: Police and Lawyer Appeal, Requesting Extreme Punishment for Ji Rentang</h3>
<p>On the morning of September 9th of last year, the General Post Office on Sichuan Road was robbed of over 90,000 yuan in cash, and one bodyguard and one senior clerk were shot and killed by the robbers. The Public Concession Police apprehended the main offender, the monk Ji Rentang (also known as the Sikong Monk), and others, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. The court sentenced Ji to life imprisonment. Ji refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The reason for the appeal was that he was not in Shanghai when the robbery occurred and did not participate in it. The Legal Department of the Public Works Department also filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting the death penalty for the defendant, on the grounds that the original sentence was too lenient. Lawyer Gan Jingxian of the department argued that the post office is a government agency located in a downtown area, and such a major case of robbing over 90,000 yuan and killing two people and seriously injuring one person is extremely serious. The defendant, Ji Rentang, is a registered monk who was previously sentenced to imprisonment for trafficking in military supplies. His past conduct is not that of a good person. The original trial, based on evidence, determined the facts of the crime, and should be punished with the death penalty in accordance with Article 332 of the Criminal Code in order to deter bandits and eliminate a scourge. However, the original verdict lightly sentenced him to life imprisonment because it could not be proven that he personally committed the murder. However, the defendant and his accomplices premeditated and carried weapons. Before looting, they first opened fire and killed people, which means that the murders were premeditated. The defendant, as one of those who seized the stolen goods on the scene, should bear joint responsibility for the murders. Furthermore, he confessed in custody that there was a hole in his inner and outer clothing, which proves this. Therefore, it is requested that he be punished with the death penalty. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Yu Huating of the High Court, along with Judges Jiang and Zhou, held a criminal session for interrogation. Chief Prosecutor Zheng Yue also attended the session. After Ji and Public Concession lawyer Gan presented their reasons for appeal, Judge Yu reviewed the evidence and ordered the case to be rescheduled for further examination.</p>
<h3>Poisoning of Elder Brother Case: Defendant Retracts Confession During Continued Trial, Xue Shuncai Overturns Previous Testimony, Insisting That He Did Not Commit Such a Heinous Act</h3>
<p>Xue Shunxiang (35 years old), a barber from Yangzhou and owner of Qingji Barbershop at 155 Yalu Road, lived upstairs with his second younger brother Shuncai, third younger brother Shunxi, mother Xie, and wife Xia. Shuncai was known to be dissolute and often pawned his clothes to spend the money. When his mother and elder brother scolded him, he would shout back. As a result, he was 22 years old and still unmarried. His younger brother Shunxi was in his early twenties and was known to be frugal, which is why he was loved by his mother and had been engaged for some time. In early December of last year, Xue Xie took Shunxi back to their hometown for the wedding. Shuncai resented his elder brother Shunxiang. On the 8th, Shunxiang was thirsty at midnight. He took the opportunity to put red arsenic into the tea and gave it to him to drink. Shunxiang became ill and was sent to Tongren Hospital. The hospital was ineffective, and he died at 10:05 AM on the 11th. Zhou Yushan, a detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, arrested him and handed him over to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details of his confession have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shu Zizhi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that the defendant had retracted his confession in the police station during the adjournment because he was instigated by a Wang from another case. The suspect had another case in the Chinese territory, so the Shanghai District Court transferred them, he said. According to the deposition of his mother, Xue Xie, her second son, Shuncai, has always been a bad egg, often pawning newly made clothes to spend the money. He doesn't do business in the shop. Her elder son Shunxiang (the deceased) only had dampness in his legs, which he had had for many years. It didn't affect his work. He worked as usual every day. When she returned to her hometown, he was healthy. She received news that he had died after returning to Shanghai. His whole body was purple, but there was no blood in his eyes or nose. According to Xue Xia, the deceased's wife, she could not leave her bed at the time because she had just given birth to a child. She did not know when her husband drank the tea, as she was sleeping soundly. The defendant often quarreled with her husband in the past. When questioned, Shuncai completely overturned his previous testimony in court, saying that he and the deceased were brothers and would never commit such a heinous act. He asked for leniency. Judge Jiang ordered him to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>大華農場 司阍捕自殺 原因為貧病交迫</h3>
<p>Around 3 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Shuxun, a 28-year-old gatekeeper from Hunan at the Dahua Farm in Baxiqiao West Kiln, under the jurisdiction of the Zhabei North Station Branch, stole a self-defense pistol, number 11421, belonging to the farm owner, Zheng Bo. While on duty in his own bedroom, he suddenly committed suicide. The bullet entered from his right temple and exited from his left forehead, causing profuse bleeding and brain matter splattering. He immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. People who heard the noise went to investigate, but it was too late to save him, and he died. The incident was then reported to the Baxiqiao Police Station, which then reported it to the branch chief, Liang Fuchu. Police were dispatched to investigate. It was heard that the deceased had recently contracted tuberculosis and had been smoking opium to cope. His daily wages were not enough to cover his expenses, and he often complained, which led him to take this drastic measure. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Liang, in addition to reporting the situation to the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau for the record, instructed the local bailiff to report to the Shanghai Local Court to request a coroner's inquest. He also summoned the deceased's colleague, Liao Huaijin, for questioning, which confirmed the facts. The corpse was funded and coffined by Dahua Farm yesterday, awaiting the arrival of the deceased's family to claim it.</p>
<h3>Oil Painter, Russian, Dies from Coal Gas Poisoning, Confirmed by Court</h3>
<p>A Russian named Pei Laiqin (transliteration), 32 years old, an oil painter, lived and worked in Shanghai, without any family members. He lived alone in room number 1 on the second floor of an apartment building opened by Westerners at 150 Avenue Notre Dame in the French Concession. He hired a Chinese houseboy named Ji Changfu, who would leave early and return late. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, Pei Laiqin burned a coal briquette stove before going to bed, placing it in the room. As a result, after falling asleep, he succumbed to coal gas poisoning and suffocated to death. The next morning, when the employed houseboy went to work, he noticed Pei Laiqin hadn't stirred by late morning. He opened the door and entered the room, only to discover that Pei Laiqin had already died in bed. The burning coal stove was still lit. (These coal briquettes are of much larger quality compared to the ordinary coal briquettes used by the Chinese for fuel. Each briquette can burn for up to twenty-four hours before going out). The air in the room reeked of coal gas. The houseboy immediately reported it to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate whether the deceased burned coal briquettes for warmth due to the cold weather or whether it was a suicide. Unable to determine the cause, the body was transported to the coroner's office attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang, accompanied by a forensic medical scribe, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from coal gas suffocation. The body was buried by the Shanghai Municipal Council Charity Society. It is often heard that ignorant Chinese people die from coal gas poisoning. However, it is unheard of in Shanghai that a Westerner died from coal gas suffocation, which is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Xinyi Public Coal Company Thrown a Bomb Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Xinyi Public Coal Company at 20 Zhengxianfang, Changsha Road, was suddenly bombed at around 2 PM yesterday afternoon.

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Publishes Emergency First Aid and Prevention Methods for Coal Gas Poisoning, Severe Weather Makes Burning Coal Very Easy to Cause Poisoning, Use Artificial Respiration for First Aid and Add Prevention</h3>
<p>During this severe winter, many citizens burn coal for warmth to ward off the cold. However, with a slight carelessness, it is easy to get coal gas poisoning, which can even lead to death. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau has specially made a simple explanation of the causes and symptoms of coal gas poisoning, as well as various first aid and prevention methods, and made it public, hoping to draw the attention of citizens. The original text is excerpted as follows: Be careful of coal gas poisoning. The cause of coal gas poisoning: When coal is not completely burned, there is a bluish-green flame. This is the phenomenon of coal gas combustion. This gas is the main component of coal poison. Because it can combine with oxygen in the air, reducing the oxygen in the air. If inhaled into the lungs, it can combine with the hemoglobin of red blood cells, becoming a compound that is not easily decomposed, causing the blood to lose its function of transporting oxygen. The human body relies entirely on blood circulation and inhaling oxygen to live. Since it is harmed by this toxic gas, it will naturally tend to death. Symptoms of coal gas poisoning: When coal gas poisoning occurs, breathing is first rapid and urgent, and there is dizziness. Then there is vomiting and spasms, gradually leading to numbness of the hands and feet, unconsciousness, and the skin turns red, especially the cheeks. First aid for the poisoned: If the heart and pulse of the poisoned person have not completely stopped, quickly move them to a place with good air circulation (when moving the patient, it is advisable to lift the limbs or move them together with the stretcher and bed, gently and flatly, and do not be rough), loosen the clothing buttons, smell a small amount of ammonia water, massage the whole body, and perform artificial respiration (simple artificial respiration method: have the patient lie prone, turn their head to the side so that there is vomit in the mouth, the rescuer straddles and kneels outside the patient's legs, uses both hands to press hard on the patient's waist, and at the same time applies pressure to the body, then relaxes the hands, and leans the body back, repeat this until the patient can breathe automatically), and then extend medical treatment. Prevention: When using a stove indoors, there must be a chimney installed to vent outdoors. Before going to bed, the coal basin must be moved outdoors or completely extinguished. Do not close the windows tightly so that fresh air can circulate indoors and remove coal gas.</p>
<h3>Machine Association Compiles and Prints Safety Equipment Self-Inspection Method</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery and National Goods Factory Association stated that the issue of factory inspections in the concessions has been delayed for several years due to arbitrary difficulties from the concession authorities, resulting in repeated factory accidents. Therefore, the "Factory Safety Equipment Self-Inspection Method" has been specially compiled and printed and distributed to factories throughout the city to reduce dangers. The following is the full text recorded by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency: In factories, it is often necessary to pile up fuel and store raw materials, which often causes fires. The most flammable items in factories are nothing more than the following: Boilers, fuel rooms, steam flues, machine friction, air engines, generators, electrical transformers, electrical wires, gas pipes, gas burners, kerosene, gasoline, candles, lighters, and chemical drugs, coal piles, alcohol, wood, paper, etc., marsh gas in sewers, and spontaneously combustible materials. Because there are flammable items, and even spontaneously combustible materials, the spread of combustion can quickly spread like wildfire. If factory owners do not have sufficient fire prevention equipment and training on weekdays, tragedies will inevitably occur, even affecting lives. Those who work in factories should not take this lightly. The effective methods of prevention are as follows: (A) Building equipment and inspection: Factories are best built with steel-reinforced concrete. Methods for storing materials and fuels: Should be built with partition walls or fire-resistant bricks. In places where there is a slight possibility of fire, if built with wood, please treat the wood with a liquid medicine to make it less flammable. Fire-resistant liquid medicine can be purchased from the Ping'an Industrial Factory. Important offices should not be close to boiler rooms, fuel rooms, etc. Factories should adopt low-rise buildings, not too high. The roof should not be made of flammable materials. Install more emergency exits and emergency iron ladders (check whether there are piles of objects at the entrance and side of the stairs). Install fire hydrants. (B) Non-building equipment and inspection: Automatic fire extinguishing device (has it been installed?). Fire alarm (has it been installed?). Fire extinguisher (has it been purchased?). Fire buckets and sand buckets (have they been set up?). Ladders, iron hooks, etc. (have they been equipped?). Other rescue equipment. (C) Management equipment and inspection: Organize a fire brigade. The number of team members can be several squads depending on the size of the factory, led by a captain. Selection of fire brigade members. Training of general workers. Establish close contact with the police authorities. Workers are not allowed to smoke while working, and when smoking during breaks, they must do so in a smoking room or open space (those who throw cigarette butts must be severely punished). The captain should often check the workers' laziness and carefulness. Those who contribute to the fire brigade should be rewarded, otherwise they should be punished. A separate annual fire protection expense should be set up on the accounting books. The above are just general situations. Factory owners can choose to adopt them according to the different environments. I hope industrialists can pay attention to this, so that unfortunate incidents can be reduced, and the investment of capitalists and the lives of workers will be more guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Fundraising to Build a Fire Brigade in the City Center Area, Estimated Expenses of 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to protect the safety of citizens' property, the Shanghai Municipal Government has planned to establish a fire brigade in the city center and has started preparations. It has allocated a site at Xiangyin Road and Guoji North Road as the headquarters. The design has been completed, and the estimated cost is 110,000 yuan. However, due to the city's tight finances, it is difficult to raise these funds. Therefore, a temporary location will be established first. The municipal government believes that this construction is related to the safety of citizens and should not be delayed. Therefore, it has decided to launch a voluntary donation from merchants and residents in northern Shanghai, which has started on New Year's Day. It is hoped that the residents of northern Shanghai will understand the importance of fire protection for merchants and generously donate to ensure that the fire brigade in the city center can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Relief Association Reports on the Tragic Situation of Drought in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road has been handling flood relief efforts, it has been constantly busy. However, northern Anhui has also suffered a drought. Not only is the area extensive, covering several counties, but the tragic scenes are repeated. Except for Huoqiu, which can only be provided with slight assistance, it is truly difficult to raise donations and cotton resources are scarce. The following is a report received from Pastor Wu Ziheng and Deacons Huang Jichuan and Wang Huawu of the Fuyang Inland Mission: Respectfully reported: This year, the area of northern Anhui has been extremely lacking in rainfall from summer to autumn. The wheat harvest was already poor, and the autumn crops have withered again. The drought disaster is severe and rarely seen in ancient times. According to a thorough investigation, the most miserable place is Madian, east of Fuyang. There are people who have not had a meal for a day or two, or buy cotton seeds to eat, or buy sesame cakes and vegetables to eat. Some have even sold their children and the family is separated. The situation is tragic and unbearable. What can be imagined in winter and next spring? Ziheng and others are increasingly concerned about this disaster and cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we implore for the victims and plan to use the disaster victims to complete the Huai embankment, which was previously built by students near Sanhe Lingshui to replace relief work. Not only can Sanhe be protected from floods, but hundreds of miles down to Zhengyang, the fields will also benefit.</p>
<h3>Pushan Villa Reports on Charitable Activities in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Shanghai Pushan Villa has been conducting various charitable activities for more than twenty years, including burying exposed bodies, providing coffins and medicine. It has had a great impact on humanitarianism and hygiene. According to statistics for the past year, a total of 1,360 large coffins, 27,887 small coffins, and 1,450 bone boxes were collected and buried in the northern and southern Chinese-administered areas of Shanghai. A total of 14,194 large and small coffins were distributed, including 335 large coffins, 16,960 small coffins, and 1,450 inner boxes collected by the villa itself. In addition, 5,248 small coffins were collected by the Xieqiao Branch and the various charity halls in the southern French Concession. The public cemeteries and hygiene departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council also consulted on the abandonment of children's corpses and the unclaimed bodies from the coroner's office of various hospitals, collecting 837 large coffins and 5,414 small coffins. The Chinese Red Cross provided 22 large coffins, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital provided 51 large coffins, the Tongren Hospital provided 37 large coffins, the Lianyang Charity Association provided 27 large coffins and 230 small coffins, the Women and Children Relief Association provided 23 large coffins, the Emergency Epidemic Hospital provided 5 large coffins, the Renji Hospital provided 4 large coffins, the Shanghai Sanatorium provided 4 large coffins, the Guangren Hospital provided 3 large coffins, the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital provided 3 large coffins, the Infectious Disease Hospital provided 2 large coffins, the Shilong Hospital provided 2 large coffins, the Xinwei Relief Association provided 1 large coffin, the Railway Hospital provided 1 large coffin, the Shanghai Hospital provided 1 large coffin, the Chinese Mental Hospital provided 1 large coffin, and the Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital provided 1 large coffin. All of the above corpses were collected and transported by the villa to the Yidi Cemetery in Dachang for burial, with markers set up to await collection. In addition, the White Cross Pushan Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital on Xinmin Road in Zhabei provided medical treatment and medicine, totaling 21,218 surgical cases and 15,712 internal medicine cases. However, the expenses are huge and funds are in short supply. We still implore charitable gentlemen to generously assist so that various charitable activities can be sustained without interruption, then the merits and virtues will be boundless.</p>
<h3>Frequent Gunfire Detailed Record of Intercepting Robbers, One Robber Escaped, One Robber Arrested</h3>
<p>The robber, Chen Butang, 25 years old, from Yancheng, and his accomplice Zhou Laosan, who is at large, used to make a living pulling rickshaws. Recently, they have been unemployed and struggling to make ends meet, so they have become bandits. At 0:30 AM yesterday, Chen and Zhou, accompanied by a weapon, broke into the Yonghe Hotel, a small inn opened by Jiang Xuzhong (49 years old), a Ningbo native, at 66 Avenue de la Reine Jeanne in the French Concession, claiming to be borrowing a bed for the night. The inn owner was in the shop at the time and had not had time to reply. The two robbers heard the sound of mahjong in the back room. Chen, armed with a handgun, went first, followed by Zhou, who was empty-handed. They broke into the room next to the mahjong table, shouting "Don't make a sound!". The four gamblers, seeing the handgun, were dumbfounded and dared not resist. The two robbers rummaged through boxes and cabinets, but found nothing. At that moment, Chen, wearing a cotton jacket and short trousers, noticed a camel-colored woolen robe belonging to the shop owner hanging on the wall. Chen turned around and went outside and searched the drawer in the shop's counter, stealing thirteen yuan and eight jiao in paper money, which he hid on his person. He fled out the door, running south. The inn owner, Jiang Xuzhong, did not give up and secretly followed the robbers. When they reached the intersection of Route Amiral Bayle, they happened to encounter Patrolmen 110, 423, and other patrolmen passing by. He immediately reported that the two robbers in front, one wearing black (i.e., Chen) was carrying a handgun, and one wearing blue (i.e., Zhou) was empty-handed. Upon receiving the report, the two patrolmen turned around and gave chase, shouting for them to stop. Hearing the sound, the two robbers fled in different directions. Chen opened fire to resist arrest, turning east from Route Amiral Bayle into Route Hennequin, then into Route de l'Orme and south on Rue Chapsal, then back to Route Amiral Bayle, firing all the way. The Chinese and Vietnamese patrolmen chasing behind also returned fire, blowing their whistles. The robber fired six shots, and the patrolmen fired seven or eight shots, but none hit. When the robber fled to the intersection of Route Amiral Bayle, he happened to encounter Zhou Bingcheng, Tian Shiqing, patrolmen Zhong Benchang, and Vietnamese Patrolman 78, who heard the sound and intercepted him head-on. Chen still tried to open fire to resist, but the bullet jammed. In the nick of time, he threw the handgun to the ground and surrendered. The detectives retrieved a French-style four-inch Blancolin handgun from the road, with a bullet still inside, which had not been fired because it was jammed. They were all taken back to the police station for detention. During interrogation, he admitted to committing the robbery and said that the stolen money had been taken by Zhou, who had escaped. The cotton robe he was wearing was the victim's clothing. The police chief ordered him to take off his clothes. All the details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. He was sent to the Second Special Court yesterday, where Judge Xiong Huizhen presided over the trial in the Criminal Division. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and requested a postponement pending further investigation before filing the lawsuit. Then, Detective Zhong Benchang and Vietnamese Patrolmen 110 and 78, and Chinese Patrolman 423 reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant for resisting arrest with gunfire, and submitted the handgun and the original stolen camel woolen robe as evidence. When Chen was questioned, he confessed to the robbery and admitted that he had fired back because the patrolmen had fired at him. He said that he fired six shots into the ground. After verifying the confession in court, the judge adjourned the hearing to 2 PM on the 13th and ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>American Professor Jackson Gives Public Lecture at Jiaotong University, The Influence of Scientific Research on the Development of American Industry</h3>
<p>Professor Jackson from the United States was invited to China by the Chinese Electrical Engineering Society to give public lectures in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, he gave his first lecture at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. The topic was "The Influence of Scientific Research on the Development of American Industry." A brief summary of his speech is as follows: "The development of industry requires continuous improvement, so research is very important. All countries in the world attach importance to research to improve industry. Whether it is medicine, agriculture, or industry, there are specialists engaged in research. The United States spends a huge amount of money every year to support national and provincial research institutes, such as the Bureau of Weights and Measures and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Various industrial manufacturing plants also spend some funds every year for research purposes. At the same time, they also pay attention to the cooperation between factories and various schools. The scope of research is determined by the main institutions, and how to research is left to the researchers. Research can be divided into two types: one is the research of applied science, which seeks to improve existing industries in the short term, and the other is the research of pure science, which is also important, but its application will be in the future. For example, Thomson's invention of the squirrel-cage motor and Bell's invention of the telephone are all the results of applied science research." Professor Jackson will give another lecture at 4:30 PM this afternoon in lecture hall number 12 of the Engineering Building of Jiaotong University. The topic is "Industrial and Vocational Education in the United States."</p>
<h3>Tan Weixue Returns to China from the United States After Completing Telephone Inspection, Will Report to Beijing Soon</h3>
<p>Mr. Tan Weixue, the Chinese Deputy General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company and General Manager of the China Electric Company, was commissioned by the Ministry of Communications last September to go to the United States to inspect the telephone industry. While in the United States, Mr. Tan also took the opportunity to negotiate the issue of telephone lines on roads built beyond the boundaries of Shanghai. He was originally scheduled to return to China at the end of November last year, but his father passed away in the United States, and he was unable to depart after taking care of the funeral arrangements. It is now reported that Mr. Tan has completed his affairs in the United States and took a ship back to China last month. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and went to the telephone company to cancel his leave and return to work. He will go to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Communications soon.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Urges Collection of Land Certificates, Deadline for Collection is the End of February, Storage Fees Will Be Charged After the Deadline</h3>
<p>Previously, the issuance of land certificates in this city was delayed because the Land Bureau failed to complete the issuance within the prescribed period, and the owners allowed it to be delayed, which became a long-standing practice. This was detrimental to both the public and private sectors. Since Director Cai took office, he has strived for promptness in the issuance of certificates. After investigation, it was found that the previous director had accumulated more than 5,000 uncompleted land certificates, which were drawn and sent to staff to rush through the night and complete within one month. In addition, there are more than 10,000 old land certificate maps that have been signed and approved by the owners but have not been collected. The number is too large and difficult to store. It was previously planned to set a deadline for collection and charge storage fees after the deadline. It is now reported that in order to urge all landowners to collect their certificates, the Land Bureau has drafted a plan and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval, dividing the area and household, listing the names, and publishing notices in the newspaper, requiring all landowners to complete the collection at the bureau before the end of February 25th. After the deadline, each certificate will be charged a storage fee of 5 jiao for the first month, 1 yuan for two months, 1.5 yuan for three months, and 2 yuan for four months or less, which will be collected when the certificate is collected in the future. Months less than one month will be calculated as one month. The above measures are intended to arouse the attention of the public. It is hoped that all landowners will be able to collect their certificates on time. It is also heard that the Land Bureau's daily office hours, except for Saturdays and Sundays, have been extended to 9 PM every day. On Sundays, it will be open from 1 PM to 9 PM as usual. The people have praised this convenience.</p>
<h3>Public Rickshaw Pullers Must Hold Licenses and Wear Armbands, Notice from the French Concession Police Department</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has recently issued a notice to public rickshaw owners and pullers stating that from now on, all public rickshaws operating within the French Concession must have pullers who hold licenses and wear armbands. Rickshaw pullers with license numbers 1 to 10000 must hold and wear licenses and armbands issued by the Public Concession Council or armbands issued by the French Concession Police. Pullers with license numbers above 10001 must hold and wear licenses and armbands issued by the French Concession Police.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Talks About the Inevitable Price Increase of Domestic Electrical Appliances</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of various raw materials used in industry have been gradually increasing, which has led to a simultaneous increase in the prices of various industrial products. Since the end of last year, no fewer than a dozen types of products have officially announced price increases in newspapers. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association, at the Ya'pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory yesterday. Mr. Hu said that the products of the industry are divided into nine categories, such as light bulbs, motors, electric beads, flashlights, batteries, bakelite, electric lights, radio, and electric combustion. Most of the raw materials for each category are domestic products, but some, such as copper wire, magnetic steel plate, and pure tungsten, have not yet been produced domestically and must be imported. Now that import prices are gradually increasing, the cost of production is increasing. If the selling price is not slightly increased, there will be a risk of loss. Therefore, at the beginning of the new year, each category may discuss increasing the selling price to compensate.</p>
<h3>Huang Zenshi and Others Promote Domestic Fertilizer Powder, Chemical Expert Mr. Wang Chang'an's Research Crystallizes</h3>
<p>Fertilizer powder is now an important raw material for farmers to fertilize their fields. However, most of it comes from abroad, so a huge amount of money is leaked out every year. In view of this, chemical expert Mr. Wang Chang'an has used garbage as raw material and, after years of research, adopted scientific methods to produce a domestic fertilizer powder. Not only is its quality harmless to crops, but it also surpasses imported products. The price is relatively low. The residue left over from the refining process is made into fuel. It is a true innovation in domestic products to use waste and increase rural production. It is currently being promoted by Huang Zenshi and others in the fishing industry in this city, and they will invite leaders from various industries in Shanghai to join the list and submit a request to the Ministry of Industry for a special patent in order to facilitate sales.</p>
<h3>英商錦名洋行　函謝中央救火會</h3>
<p>On the 25th of last month, in the early morning, a fire broke out at No. 89 Fuzhou Road, in the Dunlop warehouse. Flames raged in all directions, making it impossible to approach. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade of the Public Concession mobilized all personnel and vehicles, erected aerial ladders, and made every effort to extinguish the fire. The firefighters also disregarded personal safety and bravely advanced. The fire was discovered around 3:30 AM and was completely extinguished around 10:00 AM. The warehouse was managed by the British firm Jinming &amp; Co. The company deeply appreciated the Fire Brigade's courageous efforts and hard work. Despite some goods being completely destroyed, a significant amount was salvaged. The company recently sent a letter to the Public Works Department expressing its deep gratitude to the Fire Brigade.</p>
<h3>衡山輪脫險抵潯</h3>
<p>The incident of the "Hengshan" steamer of the Sanbei Company running aground outside Jiujiang Port has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Shanghai headquarters telegraphed the Jiujiang branch to send barges to rescue the ship. The decision was made to open the cargo hold and unload the cargo to reduce the draft, allowing the ship to float. By 5:00 PM on the 5th of this month, the "Qingpu" steamer towed the "Hengshan," and the operation was successful by 6:00 PM. The "Qingpei" steamer then towed it to Jiujiang, where the unloaded cargo was reloaded. Yesterday, the company received a telegram stating that the "Hengshan" had been completely freed. Whether there was any damage to the bottom of the ship will be inspected after it arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>西門上海銀行　警鈐走電報警之虛驚</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 2:00 PM, the alarm bell wire in the Shanghai Bank at No. 1474 Zhonghua Road, Old West Gate, malfunctioned and falsely triggered the alarm. Bao Dingyin, the petitioning police officer stationed at the bank by the Old West Gate Public Security Bureau, fearing that bandits would take the opportunity to infiltrate and cause an accident, immediately drew his gun to maintain order. Unexpectedly, his Mauser pistol went off, firing a shot, but fortunately, no one was injured. Customers inside the bank, who were depositing and withdrawing money, scattered in panic, suspecting a robbery. At the same time, the Detective Division of the Old West Gate Branch received a warning and immediately dispatched all detectives, armed, to apprehend the thieves. Upon learning of the situation, they realized it was a false alarm caused by the alarm bell malfunction. However, the order in front of the bank was disrupted, and nearby shops were alarmed.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8:20 PM, Yu Baolong, a driver residing at No. 42 Taiping Lane, Luxuezhai, driving a private car (Shanghai license No. 2922) with driver's license No. 14430, was traveling west on Bailinan Road, Xuhui. At the intersection of Yuxing Lane, Yu Jinhua, a local resident, age 32, residing at No. 94 Siming Material Store, Fuxi Road, French Concession, was walking near the lane when he was unable to avoid the car and was struck and knocked to the ground. The car's wheels ran over Yu Jinhua's leg, causing him to lose consciousness instantly and bleed profusely.

<h3>田憲臣吸食鴉片判懲</h3>
<p>Tian Xianshen, a native of Ningbo, is only 28 years old but has a deeply ingrained addiction to opium. His home is located at No. 40, Lane 727, Tiantong Road. Due to the strict opium ban, the Municipal Public Security Bureau requested the concession authorities to cooperate in arresting opium offenders, aiming to completely eradicate the habit. Therefore, the various police stations in the Public Concession have been paying close attention to opium addicts. Tian's opium den was quickly discovered. A search warrant was obtained from the First Special District Court, and on the afternoon of the 5th, detectives were dispatched, arresting Tian and seizing opium paraphernalia and opium paste. He was taken to the Huishi Police Station, where, under questioning by the police chief, he was ordered to pay 500 yuan in cash to be released on bail. Yesterday morning, he was brought to the First Special Court. Judge Huang interrogated him. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case, requesting that the defendant be punished according to Article 263 of the Criminal Code. Tian Xianshen admitted to using opium without reservation. The court, after reviewing the evidence, sentenced Tian Xianshen to a fine of 250 yuan. If he is unable to pay, he will be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

<h3>西捕投丐入河案　英公堂正式起訴　檢察官控兩被吿殺人罪</h3>
<p>On the morning of December 1 last year, a tragic incident occurred on the Suzhou Creek in this city, in which a Western police officer threw a beggar into the river, causing his death. After investigation by the police authorities, the incident was confirmed. The British Consular Court prosecutor, Haines, also began investigating and summoned the two British police officers, Peters and Gittes, who were accused of intentional homicide. Yesterday, as the investigation of the case was completed, a formal indictment was filed with the British Supreme Court for China, accusing the two defendants of intentionally killing the Chinese man Min Debiao by throwing him into the river on December 1 of last year. Yesterday morning, the final investigative hearing was held. According to the defendant Peters, on the morning of December 1 last year, he and Gittes were traveling by car near Zhoujiazui Road, Xinjihama Road, when they saw a sick beggar on the ground. They took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but the hospital did not admit him because they did not consider his illness to be serious. They then transported the beggar to the Suzhou Creek on Filan Road and pushed him onto a Jiangbei sampan moored on the riverbank. They returned to the police station around 3:00 PM. They did not know how the man died. Prosecutor Haines listened to the statement and instructed that the case had been formally indicted and that there should be no further debate. The case should be formally tried in the British Supreme Court for China. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>陳望山之女　訴請確認父女關係</h3>
<p>Chen Wangshan, a wealthy real estate merchant, resides at No. 1 Yuqing Lane, Ha'er Road, North Sichuan Road. His daughter, Chen Baobao, recently hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a lawsuit with the local court to confirm their father-daughter relationship. The petition stated that Chen Wangshan has two children. His elder brother, Chen Yunting, is fond of traveling and spends money like water, resulting in heavy debts. His friend, Zhang Wenrui, urgently demanded repayment of the debt. Chen Wangshan's strict discipline made it impossible for Chen Yunting to repay. Chen Yunting, seeing that Chen Baobao was young and easily influenced, enticed her to commit adultery with Zhang Wenrui. When the father discovered the affair, Chen Yunting further encouraged Chen Baobao to elope with Zhang Wenrui and live together. At that time, Chen Baobao regretted her youth and lack of discernment, falling into their trap and becoming a substitute for her brother to repay his debts. In August of the same year, at the Yipinxing Hotel, Chen Yunting hosted a formal wedding ceremony with Zhang Wenrui, allowing them to arrange everything. Although the couple's relationship was harmonious, they had five children. Now, reflecting on the past, she feels as if she is waking up from a dream. She regrets running away from her father and has not seen him in over a decade, causing her great pain. Last year, she returned to Ningbo to visit her family several times but was rejected. Her brother, Chen Yunting, disregarded their past relationship and instigated everything against her in front of their father. The current national law clearly stipulates that women have the right to inherit from their fathers. Therefore, she specifically files this lawsuit to request a judgment confirming their father-daughter relationship. After receiving the petition, the court, presided over by Judge He Jingxian, held a hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Chen Baobao, and her lawyer, Tu, appeared in court and recounted the past events. The defendant, Chen Wangshan, did not appear but was represented by lawyer Lu Qi, who made a plea on his behalf. The judge instructed that this case is a personal lawsuit, and it would be best if the lawyers of both parties, together with the parties involved, invite relatives and friends to resolve the matter out of court. If they do not comply, another hearing will be held. The lawyers of both parties complied with the instruction and left the court.</p>

<h3>民化小學竊案　起因於情變　女教員代表校長告發　被告又爲女教員情人</h3>
<p>—暗藏當票不實不盡—</p>
<p>The Doupai Minhua Primary School at No. 10, Lane 251, Weihaiwei Road, was founded by Yu Shangxun, 26, from Ningbo, and Ding Jiasheng, also known as Ding Hao, 26, from Muyi. It has only been established for a little over five months. Yu serves as the principal, and Ding, along with his lover, Shen Shuqing, and one Zhu Bin, serve as teachers. The day before yesterday afternoon, Shen Shuqing, representing Yu Shangxun, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station that several sets of Western suits, a hat, and a raincoat, worth 77 yuan, had been stolen since October 6 of last year. Teacher Ding Chongxing was highly suspected, and an investigation was requested. Changshan Chinese detective Yang Xinzheng, along with Western detectives, went to the school to investigate. Two pawn tickets were found in Ding's suitcase. Upon investigation, they belonged to a part of the stolen goods. Ding was arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case, filing a public prosecution according to Article 320, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, requesting that he be investigated according to the law. Yu Shangxun then testified that the defendant serves as a math and Chinese teacher at the school, earning 12 yuan per month, including room and board. After the theft of the clothes on the night of October 5, he initially suspected the cook. However, after the police investigation, it was confirmed that the cook was not suspected. The reason for suspecting Ding was that before October 5, Ding frequently borrowed money from him. However, since the incident, Ding has not borrowed money from him, and he often seemed well-off. Recently, Ding claimed to have several pawn tickets, and if he could redeem them, he could get new clothes. Therefore, he suspected him and reported him to the police. As a result, the pawn ticket for a part of his stolen goods was found in Ding's suitcase. He requested a strict investigation. Ding Jiasheng confessed to stealing Yu's clothes, claiming that he was framed. He cited his colleague Zhu Bin as a witness. The court then summoned Zhu to the stand. According to Zhu, the defendant, Ding Jiasheng, and the female teacher, Shen Shuqing, were originally lovers. Recently, Shen transferred her affection to Principal Yu, leading to the lawsuit regarding the teachers needing to find guarantors, intending to expel Ding from the school, but failing to achieve the goal. On the 2nd of this month, when Ding was not at school, Shen intended to open the suitcase previously given to Ding. He told her that Ding was not present and that it would not be convenient. Shen said that it was fine, but asked him to supervise from the side. He agreed. Shen opened the suitcase, which contained Shen's clothes. Shen flipped through it for a long time, then leaned over and took out a bundle of papers similar to pawn tickets from a bag and placed it in the suitcase, instructing him not to tell Ding if he did not ask. He could not confirm whether the pawn tickets that were found were put in by Shen. Ding Jiasheng's defense lawyer, Sun Shian, then stated that the cause of the case was actually due to a love triangle. Because the defendant, Ding Jiasheng, and Shen Shuqing were living together for more than a year. Now, Shen has transferred her love to Yu, leading to this incident. The statement of the witness Zhu Bin is enough to understand the situation. He asked the court to investigate carefully. He would vouch for Ding's character. Judge Yang Qianchang, presiding over the hearing, determined that it was necessary to summon Shen Shuqing for questioning. Because Shen was not present, he ordered a postponement for another hearing. Ding Jiasheng paid 100 yuan bail and was released on bail to his defense lawyer, Sun, pending interrogation.</p>
<h3>人力車夫　互相會南區分會之榮譽　　車夫三百餘人　致送匾額三方</h3>
<p>The Southern District Branch of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association has been established for almost half a year. Its work has been purely for the benefit of the rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession of the district, including welfare, medical treatment, and schools. Everything has been done on a significant scale and has achieved effective results, which has won the favor of the members. Therefore, sixteen members, including Hui Youde, initiated a collection of funds from over 300 people to present three horizontal plaques as a memorial. The plaque for the association was inscribed with the words "The Gate of Happiness," the plaque for the clinic was inscribed with the words "Treating All Equally," and the plaque for the children's school was inscribed with the words "Sharing the Spring Breeze." The upper inscription on each plaque reads "Presented to the Southern District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association," "Presented to the Clinic of the Southern District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association," and "Presented to the Children's School of the Southern District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association." The lower inscription on each plaque reads "Respectfully Presented by Over 300 Rickshaw Pullers." Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, over 300 members, accompanied by a musical band, brought the plaques to the association at No. 50 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession. Rickshaw puller representative Hui Youde delivered a speech, briefly expressing gratitude for the association's various undertakings and presenting the plaques as a memorial. Chen Chunbao, the deputy director-general of the Silk Association, delivered a speech of thanks, briefly stating that everything the association has is for the benefit of the members, and the members are the masters. He, on behalf of the committee members, directors, and staff of the association, respectfully accepts this great honor and expresses his gratitude, hoping that the members will provide guidance at any time. Finally, Sui Quan, the secretary of the association's executive committee, delivered a speech, briefly stating that he was commissioned by the head office to establish a branch association. For half a year, under the guidance of the board of directors and the head office, he has been able to work with the members day and night, which has been very pleasant. However, due to time and environmental constraints, the various undertakings, although slightly effective, are still regrettable because they have not reached a satisfactory conclusion. Therefore, he feels both happy and ashamed today that the members are presenting plaques. In the future, he will continue to work together with sincerity, loyalty, and bravery to make up for the past and strive for the future, so as to achieve the complete enjoyment of a beautiful happiness for the members of this district. Then, the plaque with the words "The Gate of Happiness" presented by the members today will not be in vain. He thanks everyone with the utmost sincerity on behalf of the association's staff and wishes everyone a happy new year. After the speech, a photograph was taken, and the event dispersed.</p>

<p>The meeting was announced to begin at approximately 9:00 AM. Formalities were observed. Chairman Liu Dajun gave an opening speech, followed by Qu Fangpu, representing Chen Jitang, Hu Jixian, representing Provincial Chairman Lin Yunhai, and Guangzhou Mayor Liu Jiwen, who delivered speeches successively.

The following is a summary of the Chairman's welcoming address and the speeches of representatives from various organizations on that day:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Dajun stated in his address: "Today is the opening day of the twelfth annual meeting of our society. We are honored to have the presence of officials from various organizations. There are several reasons why our society decided to hold the meeting in Guangdong. Guangdong is the birthplace of trade between China and foreigners. At the beginning of trade with foreign merchants, all Sino-foreign trade was controlled by several firms in Guangdong. This is well known. Even in intangible international trade, Guangdong occupies an important position. In recent years, China's international trade has often been in a deficit. Fortunately, the foreign capital remitted by overseas Chinese in Guangdong (previously two to three hundred million yuan annually) has served as compensation. Overseas Chinese in Guangdong have also made significant contributions to helping foreigners develop their economies in the Americas and Southeast Asia. In terms of domestic economic construction, Guangdong Province also has a special relationship. Guangdong's minerals and agricultural products were among the first to be exported abroad. Coal, tin, tungsten, antimony, manganese, and other minerals are the main raw materials for the heavy industries of various countries. Silk has also long been welcomed by foreign countries. When Marco Polo arrived in Guangzhou in the thirteenth century, China's economic development was far ahead of Europe. The Americas had not yet been developed. By the nineteenth century, the economies of European and American countries had developed rapidly, while our country lagged behind. Even our eastern neighbor has followed in the footsteps of Europe and the United States and has become a strong country in East Asia. It can be seen that economic development is an indispensable condition for national establishment. Without economic construction, the result will only be a semi-colonial state. In recent years, our country has been catching up rapidly, and economic construction has made considerable progress. In the past one or two years, Guangdong has made even more rapid progress. There are two to three hundred factories run by the people themselves in Guangzhou and Kowloon. The silk factories in Shunde and Nanhai, and the factories in various counties, are not included. The various factories run by the province have also achieved results. In the future, when the entire Yuehan Railway is completed, products from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River can be directly transported to Guangdong for export. At that time, the prosperity of Guangdong will be assured. Because Guangdong occupies an important position in economic construction, our colleagues in this society have specially held this meeting here this year, and hope to investigate the industries operated by the provincial government. Our society has been established for twelve years and has more than six hundred members. Most of them serve in the political, academic, and financial sectors and cannot spare the time. Therefore, only fifty-eight people have attended this meeting. We are grateful for the hospitality of various organizations and for the encouragement of various officials to contribute opinions on the economic construction of Guangdong Province. Our colleagues will certainly do our best to repay the hospitality."</p>
<p>Representative's Address</p>
<p>Qu Fangpu (Director of the Guangdong Finance Department), representing Chen Jitang, stated in his address: "Today, the Chinese Economic Society is holding its twelfth annual meeting. Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang is unable to attend due to public affairs, so he has specially sent me to attend on his behalf and say a few words. Since the world recession spread, China has been particularly affected. Our country has always been based on agriculture, but now the rural economy has collapsed. Guangdong is a farming area, but now it is the opposite of normal. Agricultural products are not even sufficient for self-sufficiency, and we rely on foreign countries for agricultural products worth tens of millions of yuan every year. The Guangdong government is currently engaged in relief work for rural areas, and hopes that the economic experts present will provide guidance." Hu Jixian, representing Provincial Chairman Lin Yunhai, said, "There are many reasons for China's weakness, but economic decline is the main reason. In order to develop the economy and revitalize industry, our province has set a three-year administrative plan, most of which has been completed. I will only mention the industrial aspects. The factories that have been opened include the following: Xicun Cement Plant, with assets of 7 million yuan; Henan Textile Factory, with assets of 5 million yuan; Nantoutou Paper Mill, with assets of 5 million yuan; Xicun Fertilizer Plant, with assets of 2 million yuan; Xicun Soda Plant, 1.5 million yuan (the words "assets of" are omitted below); Xicun Sulfuric Acid Plant, 1 million yuan; Xicun Brewery, 1 million yuan; Xinzhao Sugar Mill, 2 million yuan; Shitou Sugar Mill, 4 million yuan; Jieyang Sugar Mill, 3 million yuan; Shunde Sugar Mill, 3 million yuan; Huizhou Sugar Mill, 5 million yuan; Dongguan Sugar Mill, 3 million yuan, totaling 42.25 million yuan. Those currently being prepared include: Steel Plant, 30 million yuan; Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, 20 million yuan; Glass Factory, 1 million yuan; Shipyard, 10 million yuan. The total length of highways in the province is 361,101 li, including 126,317 li of provincial roads, 17,602 li of county roads, and 58,764 li of township roads. The completed mileage is 268,230 li, including 107,590 li of provincial roads, 122,390 li of county roads, and 38,115 li of township roads. The uncompleted mileage is 92,817 li, including 18,727 li of provincial roads, 53,630 li of county roads, and 10,514 li of township roads. The cost of highway construction was 2,839,720 yuan in the first year, 1,816,717 yuan in the second year, and 2,079,255 yuan in the third year, totaling 6,735,146 yuan." (3) Guangzhou Mayor Liu Jiwen stated: "The spiritual life of human society is often inevitably influenced by economic behavior. Observations in the past history have sufficient facts to prove this. You are all economic experts, so there is no need to talk more about academic theories at this time. I will simply talk about the economic policies of our province and city. Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong Province and a large city in southern China. It has a population of 1,122,500 people and has always been an important economic town in China. Since the world recession hit, the economic foundations of the province and city have been shaken. In order to provide relief, the government has established a three-year administrative plan and is proceeding step by step. Guangzhou City is a part of this province, so it is also following the plan. According to my observations, the government's economic policy can be summarized into the following eight principles: 1. Accumulate government power and develop the national economy. 2. Use the power of the national economy to create wealth for the people and develop the national economy. 3. Under the principle of not harming the people's livelihood, seek to increase private economic income. 4. Under the principle of benefiting the people's livelihood, seek to increase private economic income. 5. Strive to achieve a balanced development of rural and urban economic construction. 6. Actively eliminate all obstacles that hinder economic development. 7. Implement a cooperative system to achieve a uniform development of the national economy. 8. Under the spirit of protectionist policies, promote the development of industry and commerce. In terms of policy implementation, the third, fourth, sixth, eighth, and fourth items are related to rectification or are passive, while the first, second, fifth, seventh, and fourth items are related to construction or are active. In short, the current economic policy of the government is based on the existing economic foundation and is combined with modern theories and needs to carry out separate plans to lay a new foundation for the economic base of the entire province. As for the economic part of the province's three-year administrative plan, some have been realized and some are still being worked on. I hope that you will provide guidance or criticism based on your observations so that the government can use them as a reference. I would be most grateful."</p>

<h3>Chen Lijiang Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting Education in the Southwest (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Lijiang discussed the state of education after his inspection of the three southwestern provinces. The recent education situation in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a continuation of Mr. Chen's discussion on the education situation in Yunnan:</p>
<p>(3) Yunnan</p>
<p>Yunnan has been relatively stable internally since 1919, so education at all levels is quite well-established. Compared with Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, it is much more complete. However, the content of education at all levels in Yunnan Province still needs to be strengthened. A. Yunnan Province currently has Yunnan University, which has two colleges: science and engineering, and liberal arts and law, as well as a medical specialty. Because the annual revenue is only more than 70,000 yuan, the equipment is very simple and there are few students. In addition, due to inconvenient transportation, there is a severe lack of talent. However, the school's ethos is good, and the career prospects for students are best for those majoring in mining and metallurgy. B. The equipment of secondary education schools is acceptable, and the school ethos is also good. The only difficulties are funding and faculty. Because the value of Yunnan currency is low, one yuan of Yunnan currency is only one-tenth of a national currency. Therefore, although secondary school teachers have a monthly salary of 700 or 800 yuan, if calculated in national currency, it is only 70 or 80 yuan. As a result, many secondary school teachers also work outside the school and cannot serve with all their energy. Therefore, the development of secondary education in Yunnan Province still needs to be improved. C. Primary education in Yunnan Province is very well-managed because local education funds are completely independent, and many county education administrators are also responsible. As for compulsory education, Yunnan Province implemented it once in 1919. The central government has now subsidized 170,000 yuan, and the provincial government has also allocated 300,000 yuan. The enthusiasm of the provincial authorities for promoting compulsory education is commendable. It is now stipulated that each county should set up 15 schools or 30 classes. According to the counties I have visited, short-term primary schools have all opened as scheduled. Border and Miao education in Yunnan Province is also actively underway. More than 20 provincial primary schools are currently being established to specifically enroll Miao children, and several simple rural teachers' schools have been established to train teachers for Miao education.</p>
<p>In short, the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan are located in the remote southwest and have inconvenient transportation. Since the beginning of the Republic, they have been exploited internally by the remaining forces of feudalism and invaded externally by imperialism, resulting in political darkness and economic bankruptcy, year after year. As a result, education has also declined. Although Yunnan Province is slightly better, there are still many shortcomings. After the arrival of the central army in the southwest last year, the politics of the three provinces gradually improved. The authorities are also able to follow the central government's guidance and progress step by step. However, at this time of national crisis, and with the arrival of 1936, the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan have become the base for our nation's survival. How should we develop transportation, improve the people's livelihood, and have the surplus capacity to engage in education, and then can education be thoroughly improved? This is dependent on the central government's earnest and continuous guidance and the greatest efforts of the authorities and people of the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Beijing to Add Primary Schools Next Semester</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The Beijing Social Affairs Bureau has decided to add 48 complete primary schools, 28 simple primary schools, and 100 levels of short-term primary schools next semester. It is estimated that more than 13,000 students can be added. Due to the shortage of teachers, 200 people will be recruited starting on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Completion Ceremony of Tang Weizhi's Rujingtang</h3>
<p>Tang Weizhi, the principal of the Wuxi National Studies School and the former president of Nanyang University, is renowned for his morals and scholarship. Last year, he turned seventy. Provincial students and alumni selected a site on the side of Qinshan Baoshan Mountain to build the Rujingtang as a memorial. It was completed on the 4th. Teachers and students from both schools and representatives from various academic groups gathered together. With white hair and rosy cheeks, he personally attended and earnestly encouraged everyone to rectify people's hearts and save lives. It is also said that he will personally come to lecture on auspicious days in spring and autumn in the future. After the Donglin Academy, this is a grand event.</p>
<h3>Major Middle Schools Resumed Classes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Public and private middle schools in this city were previously ordered by the authorities to start the holidays early. Now that the schools are at the end of the semester, they have resumed classes from today to hold major exams and graduation exams. Regarding the central government's regulations on sending representatives to Beijing, teachers and students of all schools are complying with the order to prepare for the selection so that they can go to Beijing to participate at that time.</p>
<h3>The City's Illiteracy Education Situation in the Past Six Months; The Second Phase's Results are Better Than the First Phase; The Labor Literacy School's Results are the Most Satisfactory</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate illiteracy throughout the city and popularize education, the municipal government has allocated 200,000 yuan to carry out compulsory literacy education, aiming to eliminate the 430,000 illiterates in the urban area within one year. Since its implementation began on July 1st last year, half a year has passed, and the first and second phases have graduated, and the third phase has also started. The past performance is recorded as follows: The Literacy Education Committee was established in April, and April to June was designated as the preparatory period for carrying out preparatory work. On June 3rd, teachers of literacy schools were tested, and 200 were selected and 50 were put on standby, and training was carried out. A Literacy Education Propaganda Week was held to investigate illiterates. There are a total of 434,452 illiterates in the city. On July 1st, the first phase of 219 schools opened, and 48,703 people enrolled. It ended at the end of August. 34,583 people took the exam, 20,107 passed, accounting for 55% of those who took the exam, 3,170 took the make-up exam, accounting for 9%, 11,300 failed, accounting for 33%, and 14,120 were absent, accounting for 29% of the enrollment. The second phase of 220 schools opened on September 1st. In order to increase the teaching effect, the original two-month graduation was extended to three months. 55,327 people enrolled in this phase, and it ended at the end of November. 38,259 people took the exam, 27,085 passed, accounting for 71% of those who took the exam, which is better than the first phase, 4,906 took the make-up exam, accounting for 13%, 6,268 failed, accounting for 16%, and the number of absences accounted for 31%. The private literacy school sponsored by the Municipal Party Headquarters had 45,103 examinees and 22,519 graduates, accounting for 50%, and 2,250 took make-up exams, accounting for 15%. In addition, the 71 labor literacy schools jointly run by the Literacy Association and the Social Affairs Bureau had 3,934 examinees and 3,033 graduates, accounting for 77%, with the best results, 41 took the make-up exam, and 850 failed, accounting for 27%. Based on past experience, it was felt that there were difficulties such as textbooks being too difficult, no satisfactory solutions for absenteeism, teachers not being interested, language barriers, etc. Improvements have been made since the third phase, focusing on the assessment of district directors and staff, adding the heads of public security sub-bureaus and sub-stations as deputy directors to assist in handling the matter, strictly assessing teachers, rewarding private schools for establishing schools, researching practical educational methods, and awakening the general mobilization of people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Primary Education Research Results: Review Meetings to be Held Regularly</h3>

<h3>This Week's Schedule for the Western League</h3>
<p>There are no good games to watch in this week's schedule for the Western League. Only the B-team preliminary cup match between Youyou and the Eastern Chinese team is palatable.

At the end of the first half, Eastern China led 35 to 17. In the second half, Eastern China substituted reserves, and John took the opportunity to launch a major offensive, gradually closing the gap to only six or seven points, with the score at 57 to 41 and 49 to 44. Eastern China reorganized and advanced again, and John's offensive stopped. The final result was 56 to 51.</p>

<h3>Global Sports Scene Snippets: The Origin of the Five-Ring Olympic Flag</h3>
<p>The flag of the World Games is white with five colored rings of blue, black, yellow, green, and red sequentially linked. Few people know its history. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Black represents Africa, yellow represents Asia, green represents Europe, blue represents the Americas, and red represents Oceania (Australia). Therefore, the five colored rings represent the five continents of the world. Recently, due to issues of the Jewish race, Germany once discriminated against them, causing resistance from the United States, it is said.</p>
<p>Two years after the Fifth World Games opened in the capital of Sweden (Stockholm), the Great European War broke out (1914). On June 14th of that year, Baron de Coubertin at his own expense, initiated the organization of the International Sports Association in Paris. At that time, five hundred of these five-ring flags were made and sent to the committee members of various countries. The following day, at the 20th-anniversary celebration, this Olympic flag was officially used. Although it was during the Great War, this flag still flew on the city hall of Rocky Mountain in the United States.</p>
<p>After that, at the Seventh Games, embroidery was added. After each session, the flag is kept by the host city of that session. This year, at the Berlin Games, the mayor of Rocky Mountain in the United States will transfer the flag to the mayor of Berlin.</p>
<p>World's Longest Ski Jump</p>
<p>The world's longest ski ( ) jump has been officially built in Boston, USA. The total distance is 600 feet, and the center is 60 feet. The acceleration force from this jump is 75 miles per hour. Skiers start from the highest point of 684 feet, pass through a 490-foot-long jumping area, and then through a 275-foot-long land bridge for a great jump. It is said that even for the most famous first-class athletes in the United States, this intense sport is the most daring thing in the world. It is heard that the construction cost of this platform is 20,000 gold pieces.</p>
<p>New Zealand Rugby Team to Embark on Japan Tour</p>
<p>The rugby team selected and organized by all Australian universities, under the guidance of team leader Smith, departed from New Zealand on December 23 to embark on a tour of Japan. The group consists of twenty-five people. It is heard that one of the main players is only twenty-two years old, five feet nine inches tall, and weighs 166 pounds (the size of the body is very related to this ball game). The oldest player is only twenty-six years old. It is said that this team has undergone special training and has obtained the highest-level sports league tactics.</p>
<p>Rugby, which is what we call "橄欖球" [gan lan qiu] (olive ball) in our country, is the most popular ball game in Japanese universities during the winter season. Currently, all university teams in Tokyo are intensifying their training in addition to participating in league matches to prepare for this strong enemy. (This kind of rugby has what is called "Rugby" and "American" style. The "American" style is popular in the United States, while the "Rugby" style is popular in the United Kingdom. The rules are almost the same.)</p>
<p>British Invite Baseball King Ruth</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular countries for baseball are the United States and Japan. However, in recent years, various European countries have spared no effort in promoting it, showing significant progress. In the United Kingdom, there is already a trend of professional baseball, which shows the universality of the sport. Currently, baseball organizations in London plan to increase the fun of the sport. They are planning to recruit American baseball king Babe Ruth. It is said that these newly emerging professional baseball teams in London have begun contacting the American side. It is said that the conditions for Babe Ruth's trip to England, the remuneration for his on-field guidance, and the travel expenses for him and his wife will be a considerable amount. However, the British side is not worried about this and is planning to establish a baseball school and invite Babe Ruth to serve as a lecturer.</p>
<p>Japan Organizes the 12th World Games Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The news that Japan will host the 12th Olympic Games in 1940 is generally known. This is truly a major achievement for Japan's promotional work. It shows Japan's commitment to international affairs and the effort of the entire nation to respond. After receiving this possible news, the Japanese side immediately organized the 12th World Games Preparatory Committee. The first meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence, and more than 60 well-known figures in the national sports world were invited to discuss it together. The newspapers also devoted themselves to promoting it. When Mr. Wang Zhengting of our country was in Tokyo at the beginning of December, the chairman of the sports association hosted a banquet to connect international sports relations and talked about this matter. Mr. Wang also expressed his willingness to vote in favor at the Berlin meeting in the future. Although this is past gossip, it can also show their emphasis on this action. The recent situation of their preparatory committee is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Japanese side has decided to make the outer garden of the Tokyo Meiji Shrine the center of the venue for the games and is designing and renovating a large stadium with a capacity of approximately 130,000 people.</p>
<p>The swimming pool will be renovated on the existing site of the Meiji Shrine.</p>
<p>The sailing competition is set to be held near Yokohama, and the location for rowing is still under study and has not been decided.</p>
<p>Indoor sports venues for boxing, wrestling, etc., will also be completed by 1940. The location is on Surugadai in Kanda, Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Olympic Village is generally in the Tama area.</p>
<p>The winter sports arena may be in Sapporo and is under study. A decision will be made in February of this year.</p>
<p>The total equipment cost is budgeted at 7 million yen, and the cost of the games is budgeted at 10 million yen.</p>
<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(4)(4)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Now, my child, give me an honest answer. Did you take that money?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I did not!" Ned said, looking up at him with a pleading expression.</p>
<p>As those words fell from his trembling lips, someone made a hissing sound.</p>
<p>"Stop!" Mr. Pei shouted, hitting his desk heavily, looking sternly at the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Sitting there were Neda, Jieke, and Aimi. Neda and Jieke looked embarrassed after hearing it, but Aimi shouted:</p>
<p>"I didn't do it, Uncle! I'd be ashamed to hit someone who has already fallen down."</p>
<p>"A good heart!" Mo shouted. He was also very distressed because he thought that his unfortunate foreign coin had caused so much trouble.</p>
<p>"Everyone be quiet!" Mr. Pei ordered; after everyone calmed down, he said solemnly:</p>
<p>"I am truly saddened, Ned, but many pieces of evidence are against you, and your past mistakes make us easily suspicious of you. Compared to several children who never lie, you are at a disadvantage today. But, child, you must remember that I am not saying for sure that you committed this theft; I will not punish you until I know for sure, nor do I want to ask about this matter again. I will let you and your conscience decide. If you committed it, you can come here to confess at any time, day or night, and I will forgive you and help you make amends. If you are innocent, this will be known sooner or later. Once it is discovered, I will immediately apologize to you and do my best to clear your name to everyone."</p>

<h3>Securities: Big Players Enter and Exit Frequently, Bonds Rise and Fall Suddenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was surprising. Although the rising trend was strong, the falling was also sharp. The entry and exit of big players was frequent. In the beginning, the long side was victorious, then the short side was victorious. The speed of the reversal was like a gust of wind and rain, changing in an instant. Upon closer examination, in the beginning, a large player Sheng, covered his short positions, and there were rumors that the deposit interest rate would be reduced. Big players bought in extremely enthusiastically, and the rising trend was even stronger than last Saturday. Subsequently, various banks that used legal currency, due to inventory checks, had insufficient reserves and had to sell bonds to offset the shortage. This kind of change was beyond the expectation of ordinary people, and it was too fast. In two days, it rose sharply to around 4 yuan. After this blow to the market situation, it was not easy to move upward for a while. Yesterday, the market opening, the rising trend was very strong. The gold short situation rose by as much as 2.2 yuan, and the rest also rose by several jiao (cents) to around 1.5 yuan. Numbers 4, 11, 21, 43, 69, and 77 bought in one after another. At the same time, although numbers 48 and 78 sold a lot, the supply and demand were absolutely disparate. In the second session, number 43 stopped buying, and the selling pressure from numbers 11, 48, and 54 gradually surged, gradually becoming tired. The more it went on, the more it felt weak. Although number 4 had bought in, it felt impossible to pull it up. The gold short moved forward sharply and retreated quickly, falling back by 1.15 yuan, and the rest also fell by several jiao (cents) to about 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon session, the falling trend rose sharply, beyond expectations. Numbers 11, 23, 48, 54, and 78 were extremely enthusiastic about selling. The market price continued to fall even more sharply. Number 23 closed 1.05 yuan lower, and the trend had softened, with the risk of continued decline. The market price result was extremely chaotic. Most of them rose by several jiao (cents) to 1 yuan, and numbers 19, 22, and 23 closed slightly lower. Therefore, today's market must still be chaotic. The total number of transactions was about 3 million yuan. The result of the rise and fall is compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Third-Grade Yarn Falls Suddenly in the Afternoon, Yarn Market's Attempt to Rise is Frustrated Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The situation became more and more weak. The situation of overseas cotton yarn was uniformly inclined to downstream. The falling trend of Osaka third-grade yarn was particularly strong, and people's hearts turned frustrated. In the afternoon, the market suddenly declined because Changfeng's longs suddenly closed, resulting in a loosening of the table. However, spot yarn sales are gradually developing, and Xiang, Yue, and Dian gangs are purchasing very enthusiastically, it is said.</p>
<p>Auctioned Yarn Rises Quickly and Falls</p>
<p>The auction yarn market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was unusually scattered, with a scattered and weak state. The current month was auctioned empty, and there were no bids. When it was auctioned to the far month, there was a slight increase, but the transaction was very few. After the second session, it was heard that the spot yarn sales market had improved. The Xiang and Yue gangs bought particularly vigorously, and people's minds recovered slightly. As a result, each month rose by 2, 4, and 6 jiao (cents) compared with the closing price of the previous day. However, the June period had no auctions opened in all four sessions, and all were blackboards, which shows the silence of the transaction. The afternoon market opened with a slightly stronger trend, and each month rose by 3 to 4 jiao (cents). Spot yarn business was active, and the Dian gang's intake also expanded. The transaction of each party was more than 2,200 bales, it was expected. Who knew that when it was auctioned until the third closing, the market price suddenly turned frustrated because Osaka third-grade yarn fell sharply by 2 to 3 yuan, and Changfeng's long positions came out, the table was slightly loosened, and it fell down. As a result, each month fell by 5 to 6 jiao (cents) to 1.1 yuan compared with the previous day's closing price.

<h3>Cotton Market Closing Shows Intense Declining Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening due to the weakness of American cotton and large-scale selling by Indian cotton operators, intensifying the decline. Benchmark prices are stable, and market sentiment is increasingly sluggish. Current cotton consumption is quite dull, and the delivery period is held twenty days earlier, so recent business is said to be more active.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Chang and Others Release Stock</p>
<p>The opening of the benchmark flower market saw slight declines in all months due to the gloom of American cotton and the intensification of the decline in Indian cotton. Trading in the market was extremely sparse, and the market situation was quite flat. As a result, all months fell by 5 to 20 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening heard that current yarn consumption was good, and benchmark prices were firm. Buying interest was slightly stimulated and rose by 15 cents, but the Changhe Jinye group took advantage of the rise to release stock again. Osaka Sanpin flower prices plummeted by 60 to 70 cents. The three closing prices suddenly slumped, and the declining trend intensified again. As a result, all months fell by 25 to 30 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Sales included Daji 600 dan, Mingde 500 dan, Shenchang 1300 dan, Shenji 700 dan, Yongchang 500 dan, Yikang 900 dan, Changyu 1000 dan, and Changhe 6100 dan.

<p>Cotton Sales Ordinary</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is mediocre, and factories are not satisfied. The source is 500 dan of Yao flower and 820 bales of Tong flower.</p>
<p>Late December of Last Year Hua Ri Yarn Export Statistics</p>
<p>The total export volume of Shanghai Hua Ri yarn in mid-December was 13,992 bales, of which the export volume of Hua yarn was 10,598 bales, an increase of 2,145 bales compared to the 8,457 bales in the previous ten days.

<p>Oomra Cotton Reduced Harvest Upper Week Indian Cotton Market Sees Firm</p>
<p>Last week, the cotton market was firm, partly due to the reduced harvest of Oomra cotton and partly due to the optimism of operators. There has been no progress in foreign real demand. Europe only bought a small amount of Karachi cotton. Bombay is completely inattentive, China is stagnant, and Japanese exports are also difficult to satisfy. Indian factories have slightly replenished their stocks, but real consumption needs are still lacking. The appendix shows the statistics for the upper week on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<p>Indian Yarn Comparison Slightly Soft</p>
<h3>Grain Distant New Flour Alone Rises Four and a Half Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, the morning opening, trading was very light, and prices fluctuated little. This month's prices slightly improved due to slight customer purchases. February-April saw mostly long position closings, with a slight drop of half a cent. June new flour rose slightly by one cent because of very little stock being released, and factories remained still. Pushed to the afternoon opening, trading slightly improved, and prices rebounded by two or three cents. Because current chips are scarce, buying is easily firm as soon as it moves, and prices also fall sharply if factories release stock. Looking at the upper and lower market turnover of only 250,000 odd bags, it can be seen that the closing period will see little development.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Trading Both Silent</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, morning and afternoon openings, were very quiet in all months. This is because there is only a dime's difference in the quotations for foreign wheat. Internal and external transactions are both unwilling to buy or sell due to the closing of accounts. Moreover, chips in the market are becoming increasingly thin, resulting in a situation of silence in both buying and selling. New buying and selling in the future will see even less, so the market has little momentum for progress. Closing prices for all months were generally the same as the previous week. Spot wheat trading was also quiet, with only sporadic transactions of 200 to 300 bags, with prices opening at 90 to 91 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Receives Flour Sales Support</p>
<p>Overseas wheat, the potential flour needs of the United States and the statistical status of global wheat are sufficient to support prices from falling.</p>
<p>Du Mi Ke Xian Sales Are Active</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, a total of more than 40 sources arrived from various groups (with more than 8,000 stones of goods). The sales market in this street is quite active, so the market situation has improved. If thick early Japonica rice prices rise by 10 to 20 cents, thin Indica rice bagging is also strong, with an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 bags sold. Thin Indica rice prices have also increased, with high grades adding 5 cents, and good quality middle-market goods adding 8 cents. Du sharp Indica also rose by about 10 cents. Foreign sharp Indica is in short supply, and the market for variable yuan goods is rare and brisk.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the sources from various riversides were slightly scarce, about 30 plus. The sales of white Japonica rice in the market are still active through store sales. Stockpilers are taking slightly, and prices are tight by 10 to 20 cents. Early rice is following closely by about 10 cents. Thin Indica rice also has a tight trend. Sheep sharp zero bagging continues to be active, and prices have slightly tightened. White Yuan zero break is quite active, and prices have increased by more than 10 cents. Customer sharp Indica is firm, and the prices of other goods are also tight.</p>
<p>(Customer Indica) The source is still strong, and the stock is also full. The trend this month is gradually falling. However, yesterday, the digestion in this street was particularly strong, and the dealers in Zhabei were particularly greedy in their intake. Market sentiment is upward, and the market atmosphere is lively. High-grade grades have all jumped by about 10 cents. Throughout the day, 6,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,650 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, 685 bags of Yongbo rice, 200 bags of Hunan rice, and 500 bags of Shashi rough rice were opened. In total, more than 13,000 bags were all handled by this street. At present, the intake is still strong. If sales continue to be strong in the future, then the market price still has the expectation of stepping up.</p>
<h3>Soybean Trend Still Stable</h3>
<p>Soybeans are still stable. Yesterday, two cars of Zhengyangguan beans were opened, with prices ranging from four yuan six jiao to five jiao and a half. 200 bags of Lanfeng beans were priced at four yuan six jiao and a half, all handled by factories. The remaining Du Sha yellow and Za beans and above are mostly medium-grade goods, and the sales channels in Zhejiang Province, Nanyang, and this street can still be maintained. The foreign sesame merchants ordered February delivery at a buying price of eleven yuan seven jiao and a half, but because there were few sellers, no transaction has been made. The standards have been rising softly for several days.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Dry Cocoons Are Scarce, Silk Prices Rise Secretly Rose Fifty Yuan During Holiday</h3>
<p>The silk market rose secretly by about 50 yuan during the New Year holiday, which was truly unexpected. Although there was no trading in Shanghai yesterday, the market atmosphere was quite brisk. Silk factories that have not yet stopped work are now short of cocoons, and silk merchants are generally raising prices. The silk market has entered a firm path. The current dark price for white factory silk B-grade grades 78 is 840 yuan for 20.22 denier, 900 yuan for 83 denier, and 950 yuan for 13.15 denier "Dancing" grade.</p>
<h3>Hardware New Wire Quietest For A Long Time</h3>
<p>New wire has recently been quiet for a long time and there are signs of changing. Fuzhou, Wenzhou and other groups are scrambling to buy it, with transactions reaching 60 to 70 barrels. Prices have eased compared to before as the year-end approaches and dealers are eager for funds. For example, medium-grade varieties are estimated at 4 yuan per dan, and prices can still be lower for large-volume and cash transactions. Fine varieties are priced at 16 yuan 5-6 jiao, which is also 4-5 jiao cheaper than before. It is estimated that there are still 200 to 300 barrels of spot goods in the market, so the price will not easily recover for a while.</p>
<h3>Oil Market White Tung Oil Before Closing Account Transaction Becomes More Calm: Market Price Has No Difference</h3>
<p>White tung oil's ports were closed for consecutive days, so foreign firms in Hankou also stopped transacting goods. The closing price at the end of last year was 51 yuan foreign standard per dan, and the opening price this year is still 51 yuan. However, the Changde market has increased from 41 yuan 2 jiao to 42 yuan 5 jiao, making the Hankou market slightly tighter. However, the period for closing accounts in various places is approaching, and everyone is trying to end the year, so trading is becoming more calm. Most of them are throwing away this month's futures oil before the accounts are settled, so spot oil transactions are few tens of tons. Even if the market is brisk, it is still easy and there is no possibility of a sharp rise. It is necessary to wait for the accounts to be settled before there is hope for development. Although foreign firms in this port sometimes trade, the number is even smaller, so the stockpiles of merchants specializing in exports are not too large. When there are dozens of tons of business, several firms have to work together, because the source of Zhejiang Province, which relies on input, does not have a large amount that can be transported. Zhejiang Province's full-length goods are said to be in the range of 47-48 yuan per bushel. However, it is said that the futures that were previously thrown to firms in this port may not be cleared within the year. The failure to deliver the goods on time is also a long-standing practice.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market New Chao Qing Drops Four to Five Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was still flat. The association drew plates. The spot price of 24 raw sugar white was called 22 and a half yuan, and the transit goods were 7 yuan 2 jiao, but no transactions were made. Dongchi and Ba Dongbai were both called at the original price. This factory's cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 11 and a half yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were refunded according to the number plate. The Chao gang opened a new Chao Qing price difference of 9 yuan 8 jiao the day before yesterday, accounting for more than 700 bags. Yesterday, another 200 odd bags were opened, accounting for Ti Zhuang Qing 10 yuan 4 jiao, Huanggang Qing 10 yuan, and then to 9 yuan 8 jiao. Xi Qing had the same price, a drop of 40 to 50 cents. Dozens of bags of ordinary Zhiyang white were also opened at 14 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Riding Breeches Selling Well, Continuing to Rise</h3>
<p>Riding breeches are still selling well, and tailoring sales are particularly strong in the Daxin Street area. Various Western clothing stores in this port also continue to cut. Their sales are higher than overcoat materials and herringbone serge. The selling price has risen because of the lack of inventory, the continued lack of domestic products, and the fact that riding breeches are also in season in the spring. The seller is particularly optimistic and raising prices, and the market atmosphere has a tendency to reach its peak. Yesterday, Kong Shi No. 100 was selling for 8 yuan 5 jiao, old 1005 was selling for 7 yuan 7-8 jiao, new 1005 was selling for 7 yuan, and ordinary No. 2 goods were all selling for 5 yuan 6-7 jiao. Domestic Zhanghua riding breeches door sales were all 6 yuan.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Ni Shanglong)</p>
<p>What is there to congratulate in the New Year, what is there to be happy about! Every person loses a section of their life line with each New Year. If one thinks about how many New Years one can live, and how much success one has had in past years, one cannot help but sigh!</p>
<p>The homophone of "new" is "awake," so the New Year is the Year of Awakening; then, those friends who are immersed in prostitution and gambling should be the time to wake up, from now on determined to repent, reschedule, wash their hearts and renew their faces, and be a complete good citizen.</p>
<p>The days of the New Year are wasteful days, and the money in people's pockets is rolling around, but friends! Don't forget the tens of millions of victims who are freezing and starving in the ice and snow, on the verge of death! The money you waste in one day of the New Year is enough to save the lives of many victims!</p>
<p>Every person has a beautiful hope in their heart when they pass a New Year, but often there is no perseverance and only hope, and when things pass and the situation remains the same, there are only the scars of disappointment left.</p>
<h3>Catering to Modernity</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Women's cheongsams, long, short, wide, narrow, high collar, low collar, long sleeves, short sleeves, high crotch, low crotch, long body, short body, ... In the past ten years, countless styles have been turned over, so everyone frowned and said, with so many patterns changing every season, it is impossible to keep up even barefoot. In fact, in this day and age, what doesn't change patterns there? However, the style of cheongsam changes faster than other things.</p>
<p>For example, the cars that bump around on the street, in 1932, the tall, three-dimensional style was popular. In 1933, the snub-nosed style was popular. In 1934, the big-butt style was popular. In 1935, the streamlined style was popular. I wonder what 1936 will be like?</p>
<p>Another example is architecture, which has changed from church style to Spanish style to three-dimensional style, from three-dimensional style to the rare American seaside villa style with pillars, and then from this style to the streamlined style, almost every year there are new patterns to play out. Because the buildings are constantly changing patterns, the furniture in the house is also constantly changing. In furniture stores, three-dimensional, streamlined, obese, a large stack of drawers to the ground, skinny, four thin legs, supporting the whole body, all kinds are complete. But what is displayed in the window are all small and exquisite, and the structure is very simple. So I know that the small one is the 1935 or 1936 style.</p>
<p>The film industry has also been constantly changing in recent years. Detective films, comedies, fantasy films, love films, sad films, erotic films, war films, adventure films, and historical films that specialize in depicting Roman palace courts and Tsar stories have each occupied a relatively long period of time. At the same time, the literary circles of our country are also constantly turning in the direction of the Tongcheng School, the Drinking Ice Room School, the Four-Six Sentence School, the New Youth School, the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School, the Revolutionary Literature School, the Humorous School, the Essay School, and the Mass Language School. Writers are constantly changing the patterns of their pens.</p>
<p>That's right, stagnation is not progress. The earth is constantly moving forward, and everything on the earth naturally cannot be allowed to be inert and static. Let it change, don't be a laggard of the times.</p>
<h3>Seeking Help From Others Is Worse Than Seeking Help From Yourself</h3>
<h3>Liu Yazi's Vienna Seafaring Record</h3>
<p>— Feng Gan</p>
<p>The poet Liu Yazi, with a sad view of the difficult times and a disheartened view of national affairs, has long converted to Zeng Jinke's "playing mahjong." Occasionally, he has set foot in dance halls, but has not had the courage to go to sea. On New Year's Eve in 1935, he attended a banquet at the Shanghai Tongshe in Tongxing Building, where he drank heavily with Li Dachao, Zhu Fengwei, Huang Jiping, Huang Tianpeng and Mrs. Xu Weinan, and became drunk. Then he went to Vienna and asked Miss Li Lizhen to be his tutor. He dragged her rickshaw more than fifteen times. Those who saw it said that although the poet's skills were not high, his revolutionary hard-working spirit was deeply admirable. If you don't believe me, there is a poem to prove it:</p>
<p>(Jin Lou Qu) Old man at fifty. Sighing that in his life, there is nothing that is good, it is time to know what is wrong. The new learning is very deep and subtle, the oily and greasy fragrance of the flesh is immortal. Laughing at the depression of cloud emotions as before, constant dancing and singing are our business, look at the rivers and mountains lightly entrusted to slender hands. Full of blood, always let down. Wishing Zongqi to die for many years, ashamed of the famous Wu scholars. After Shao Wei committed the crime, he was embraced with warmth and pity for the delicacy of Chu, it was difficult to send away the stars and constellations across his chest, and he wiped the red tears on his embroidered handkerchief. Don't say that the encounters are all just a play, I am afraid that Hou Sheng will lose to Xiangjun. Endure my drunkenness, the wine of the new pavilion. (In return)</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Three Loud Talk In the Room Striving to File a Lawsuit Connecting Old Friends for Mutual Benefit</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said: Could it be that he dares to take over someone else's wife? If he doesn't send the person back, I will invite the guests from Little Western Heaven to come out and reason with him. The waiter turned around and looked out the window, then took a step closer and said in a low voice: You are our good guest, and you always treat our waiter very well. We can't help but care about you. That Mrs. Lan just offended the entire hotel the day before yesterday, and today she is deliberately acting as a female knight, adding this one more thing. Listening to the tone of these guests, they all say that Mrs. Lan is doing a good job. If you reason with him, I'm afraid you won't win, right? Jia Duocai calmed himself, hid his chin straight into his chest, suddenly raised his head and looked at the waiter: Those women... The waiter was so anxious that he shook his hands wildly, and said softly: Mr. Jia, you can't say that, their news is very well-informed, and they will all know it in less than half an hour. Jia Duocai said: They didn't come down from Liangshan Village, if they act recklessly, I will go to the court to sue them. The waiter laughed: They have long expected that you have this layer, and Mrs. Lan has already said that if you sue, he will be your defendant. Do you think they are still afraid of things? Jia Duocai slapped the table and said: Bastard! You underestimate your master. Your master has seen all kinds of big scenes, and I won't capsize in the gutter when I come to Xi'an, right? Who told you the idea and taught you to use these big words to scare me. Bastard! Bastard! The waiter's good intentions unexpectedly caused him to scold him so loudly, and he had to retreat two steps backward, until he retreated to the door of the room. Jia Duocai slapped the table again and said: What else do you have to say, just say it, the master is not ambiguous at all. Hmph! If I show my skills, I'll teach you to recognize me. Although he was scolding the waiter, he raised his face and faced the window, and sent these words to the upstairs through the glass window. The waiter took advantage of his inattention and slipped out of the door, looked at the hallway, stood a lot of travelers, all laughing. The waiter stuck out his tongue and plunged his head forward, plunging into the waiter's room. (388)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Diary Without Entries</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>"It's New Year's"! It seemed someone was whispering in my ear:</p>
<p>But when I opened my eyes and looked around, I felt that my body was still lying in that dark garret; the gray walls, the gray broken bed, the gray furniture, were still the same as before, and I didn't find any New Year's atmosphere there. What is the difference between the old year and the New Year"? I asked myself a little incredulously, but no one answered me, but the children's laughter and the sound of firecrackers outside the door broke through my doubts.</p>
<p>"It's another year"! Quietly standing in front of the window, I thought to myself that I was another year older; therefore, my heart became heavy. I felt that I was still young a few days ago, but now I am old. Because although it has only been a few days apart, I have to admit that I have increased by another year of age!</p>
<p>The days of wandering pass quickly, and I have spent another year here. But looking back on the past year, I really felt like I had a big dream, and this dream was so long.</p>
<p>I can't think about my past anymore, because I haven't had any funny dreams in the past. I don't want to think about the present either, because I don't have a peaceful life now. I dare not think about my future even more, because I have never had beautiful hopes for the future. Such a long, so far process has only been spent in sorrow and tears. Now, I am a warrior who has been defeated by the environment, carrying serious wounds, and fleeing back from the battlefield, groaning in the deserted wilderness. However, I don't dare to let the sound of this groan be too loud; I am afraid that my enemies will hear it and come over and stab me with a bayonet. However, I don't want anyone to come and save me either, I just hope that I will die lonely like this, and no one in the world will even know how I died!</p>
<p>In order not to be like other people, willing to be a prisoner of the environment and a slave of life, letting my soul be sold piecemeal, suffering the pain of cold-blooded trampling and devastation, I finally escaped here with serious injuries.</p>
<p>In the past, I had fought bravely many times, and the songs of ...... and the heroic shouts did indeed ...... the hearts of the years, making them gradually ...... from numbness. At that time, I also felt a little proud:</p>
<p>"I am young, I have perseverance, as long as I fight, I am not afraid of the wall made of iron and will definitely create a way out for me." I said, straightening my chest, as if I had become a brave warrior.</p>
<p>But, youth will disappear in life, perseverance will be destroyed by life, and courage will eventually turn into decadence; now, I can only lie in the wilderness where no one is and sigh.</p>
<p>Now, I am afraid that someone will ask me how old I am this year, because I will feel sad and ashamed as soon as I mention my age! But I can never think about it again, let it die as lonely as my youth. ——</p>
<p>Silently, I closed the window, walked to the table, and pulled out that diary full of firm dust from the pile of old books under the table. When I opened it, there were only a few lines written inside:</p>
<p>January 1st: Sunny, ×××××××</p>
<p>January 2nd: Sunny in the morning, cloudy in the afternoon,……</p>
<p>January 3rd: Hurricane——</p>
<p>January 4th: Heavy fog in the morning, light rain in the afternoon,？？？？</p>
<p>January 5th: Flying rain and snow, ！！！！</p>
<p>The diary only wrote up to January 5th, and all the entries were replaced by symbols. After that, all were blank pages of paper, without a single word. I also understand this, it's not that there was nothing to record in the middle of the year, nor that I was too busy to even have time to write a diary; if I said that I was lazy and unwilling to write, that would also be arbitrary. In fact, it was because my life was too miserable, so I couldn't bear to record it, let it disappear with the passage of time in the shadows of the past!</p>
<p>But now, suddenly reopening that diary without entries, couldn't help but make all the old and new wounds leap onto the paper again. Although there are no words on the paper, they are written very clearly in my memory. Looking at this page after page of diaries without entries, it is even more poignant and eye-catching than the diaries with entries!</p>
<p>"It's New Year's again, should I write this year's diary"? I asked myself like this, but there was no answer.</p>
<h3>Notes on What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Mao De)</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I happened to pass by a place, which was in Tanzikou, where most of the residents were from Jiangbei, with small thatched houses covered with rice straw. The streets are only five or six feet wide, and some things are placed on both sides, making it difficult for fat people to walk. The street often smelled of stink, and there were more dung vats than thatched houses. Men and women could urinate and defecate everywhere. I walked a few steps and my shoes were full of shit.</p>
<p>Most of the residents here are amphibious animals. Some live by rowing small boats, and some work and eat on the river bank. Their lives are very hard. There are always five or six people in each small boat. Among these five or six people, one is the head of their whole family, and the others are the head's wife or children. Rowing the oars and unloading the goods on the boat are all the responsibility of the head of the family, so the head of the family is also the most important person in their whole family. There was a boat, probably because the head of the family had died. His wife was lying on the side of the boat and crying. Many people gathered on the shore to watch, and everyone's face showed a miserable expression. The woman in the boat kept begging the crowd; her meaning was to ask us to donate a few coins to buy a coffin for her husband. After all, not many people on the shore went to their pockets to get it.</p>
<p>"If there is a paradise, this should be hell!" On the way back, I thought like this.</p>

<h3>Fourth National Physicians' Representative Assembly Work Report (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xu Naili</p>
<p>4.  Handling Membership Organization Application Matters: There have been quite a few cases of this type in the past two years. Some needed to be forwarded to higher authorities, some to local governments, and others sought clarification and resolution of disputes. For convenience, they are categorized as follows:</p>
<p>Seven cases were forwarded to higher authorities: (A) Correspondence from the Hangzhou Physicians' Association requested forwarding to the Ministry of Judicial Administration an order to all courts to employ medical experts as much as possible when handling medical cases, to participate in discussions or as jurors, and to conduct thorough scientific testing. The previous Third Executive Committee meeting resolved to forward the request. The response received stated that courts at all levels mostly appoint experts for assessments in medical cases according to the law. As for participation in the jury system, current laws do not provide a basis, so it should not be considered. (B) Correspondence from the Hangzhou Physicians' Association requested forwarding to the Legislative Yuan a request for the prompt promulgation of the Physician Law and Pharmacist Law. The Third Executive Committee’s ninth meeting resolved to forward the request. Although the Legislative Yuan instructed the Legislative Affairs Committee to record it for future reference, there has been no sign of drafting such legislation to date. Therefore, effective requests must continue to be made in the future. (C) Correspondence from the Yin County Physicians' Association requested forwarding to the Ministry of Interior an order to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to strictly enforce the Midwives Ordinance in the county. The Third Executive Committee’s twelfth meeting resolved to forward the request. The official dispatch was immediately approved and is already in effect. (D) Correspondence from the Xijing Physicians' Association expressed objections to the medical curriculum outline proposed by the Ministry of Education’s Medical Education Committee and requested a thorough review. The Third Executive Committee’s fourteenth meeting resolved to circulate it to all member organizations to solicit opinions and appointed five members to be responsible for the review. Many written opinions were received from various locations and reviewed by the review committee. The results were summarized into eight key points and sent to the Medical Education Committee for adoption. (E) Correspondence from the Hangzhou City Physicians' Association requested forwarding to the Ministry of Interior a request to cancel the local authorities' ban on the free sale of Lysol disinfectant. The Third Executive Committee’s fifteenth meeting resolved to forward the request. It was later approved and is in effect. (F) Correspondence from the Shanghai City Physicians' Association requested that, in order to regulate the wording of medical advertisements, a report be submitted to the Ministry of Health requesting that all provinces and cities comply with Article 18 of the Provisional Physician Regulations. The Association was also requested to make a unified request. After discussion at the Third Executive Committee’s eighteenth meeting, a report was immediately submitted to the Ministry of Health, requesting its implementation. The response received indicated that the regulations set by the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau had been approved and ordered to be followed throughout the country. However, the original text of the regulations set by the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau lacked specific standards for advertising review. Therefore, the Third Executive Committee’s nineteenth meeting resolved to submit another request, attaching specific measures for adoption. The response received indicated that it would be retained for consideration. (G) Correspondence from the Minhou Physicians' Association reported a dispute over the collection of shop taxes from clinics by the local tax bureau and requested forwarding to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health for exemption. The Third Executive Committee’s second joint meeting of executive and supervisory members resolved to forward the request. A telegram from the Ministry of Finance last December indicated that the situation had been corrected. (H) In addition, the Wuxi Physicians' Association requested that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health provide protection for medical anesthetic drugs, and the Wu County Physicians' Association requested that the Ministry of Health ban the Blue Medicine Secret Formula for treating the lungs. Both cases were forwarded, but there was no thorough resolution.</p>
<p>Correspondence was forwarded to local governments, such as the case of Feng Zijun in Nanjing, who claimed to be the "King of Lung Treatment." He was not tolerated in Nanjing, so he moved elsewhere to spread rumors. The association was requested to send a letter to the responsible government office nearby to investigate and ban him. Letters were sent separately to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting joint action to ban him.</p>
<p>Some requests sought resolution of association name disputes, such as those from the Kunming Physicians' Association in Yunnan, the preparatory committee of the Jinjiang Physicians' Association in Quanzhou, the Guangzhou City Physicians' Association, and recently the Wu County Physicians' Association. All were ordered by local party headquarters to change their names to "Western Medicine Association." They requested clarification. The Executive Committee repeatedly discussed the matter and concluded that the name "Physicians' Association" was stipulated by the Provisional Physician Regulations and should not be ambiguous. Similar disputes had occurred before, and the Association had successfully defended its position in the past. Therefore, all requests from various locations were answered based on this principle. In the case of the Guangzhou City Physicians' Association, the Association repeatedly wrote to the provincial party headquarters to explain the situation. Although the original position was ultimately upheld, the exchange of correspondence wasted a great deal of time.</p>
<p>Other requests sought clarification, such as the case of the Ningyan Physicians' Association, which had questions about the wording of opium testing; the Shashi Physicians' Association, which had questions about the local government's crackdown on physicians without ministry-issued licenses; the Zhenjiang Physicians' Association, which sought to amend the membership admission clauses in its articles of association; and the Jiangyin Physicians' Association, which had questions about the membership of midwives. All sought clarification on eligibility and were answered by the Executive Committee. The matters were trivial, so no detailed report is provided.</p>
<p>5.  Handling Matters Entrusted by Higher Authorities: There were few events in the past two years entrusted by higher authorities. In total, there were only three cases. The first case occurred in September 1934, when the Ministry of Health requested assistance in investigating and replying to a request from the Chaoan Physicians' Association in Guangdong for clarification on membership eligibility. The Third Executive Committee’s ninth meeting resolved to reply based on the established cases of physician associations in various locations and attached the current articles of association of the association’s member organizations for reference. The second case occurred in March of last year, when the Ministry of Health forwarded a letter from the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee seeking physicians' opinions on the issue of patients being given prescriptions. The Third Executive Committee’s fourteenth meeting resolved that, according to world practice, the purpose of a prescription is to instruct the pharmacist to prepare the medicine. Whether to give the prescription to the patient is at the physician’s discretion. The resolution was submitted as a reply. The third case occurred in May of last year when the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters promulgated measures for the establishment of literacy schools by various organizations, setting a deadline of two weeks to prepare and report. The measures were immediately followed, and approval was obtained from the municipal party headquarters to be designated as the 58th school. Classes began on June 10 and lasted for two months. Although only thirteen students were approved as graduates by the authorities, more than forty people actually had the opportunity to become literate. Most had too many absences due to work, which prevented them from being examined.</p>
<p>6.  Handling Other Temporary Events:</p>
<p>In 1934, the central government promulgated strict conditions for the prohibition of highly addictive drugs. There were no special regulations for medical anesthetic drugs, which caused inconvenience in both the medical and pharmaceutical fields. First, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a letter requesting a unified position. Later, representatives were sent to participate in a joint meeting of the Shanghai City Physicians' Association, Pharmacists' Association, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, and other organizations. The government accommodated various opinions, and it was heard that the Ministry of Health had been designated to handle the transfer of medical anesthetic drugs. The resolution of this case is expected to be achieved in the near future. Therefore, the resolution of this case is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>In addition, over the past two years, letters have been received from public organizations or individuals in Guangdong, Zhenhai, Zhangjiakou, and other places, requesting assistance in applying for supplementary licenses for physicians who missed the deadline for registration but were generally eligible for flexible registration, or requesting the opening of refresher courses. The Executive Committee repeatedly discussed the matter and concluded that local governments could advocate for assistance or relief. Therefore, replies were made accordingly.</p>
<p>There were also several cases of individuals seeking resolution of legal disputes. Each was answered, instructing them to first appeal to the nearest physician association, as individual requests are not usually accepted.</p>
<p>7.  Other Reporting Matters:</p>
<p>In the past two years, six new member organizations were approved: Zhangjiakou, Xijing, Guangzhou, North, Lanhou, and Tian. There have also been some changes in the personnel of the General Office. In June 1934, Economic Committee member Niu Huisheng requested resignation due to illness. The Third Executive Committee’s sixth meeting resolved to appoint Xia Shenchu and Jiang Zhenxun as acting members. To organize the old cases of past assemblies, Jiang Zhenxun was hired as Secretary-General in August 1934. Recently, Standing Committee member Pang Jingzhou went abroad for observation. The Third Executive Committee’s twenty-first meeting resolved to temporarily appoint Jiang Zhenxun as acting member. In addition, for those who participated in other organization conferences, such as the second conference of the Chinese Medical Association held in Nanjing, Chu Minyi, Hu Dingan, Jin Mingyu, and Chen Wenda were appointed to participate. For the third conference held in Guangzhou, the Standing Committee member of the Guangzhou City Physicians' Association was appointed to attend nearby, and Niu Huisheng was also appointed to attend. For the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference on Double Tenth Day in 1934 and the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Association on November 10, 1935, both held in Shanghai, Xu Naili was appointed to attend.</p>
<h3>The Development of Pathology (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yueqi</p>
<p>—Medical Story Fifteen—</p>
<p>However, the true founder of pathology should be Morgagni. Morgagni’s observations were much more detailed than Bonetus’. In 1761, his famous work "The Seats and Causes of Diseases" (De Cansis Norborum) was published. It consisted of a series of letters from Morgagni to a young student, similar to Bonetus' work, documenting the symptoms of a patient and the examination of internal organs after death. Compared to Bonetus, Morgagni was a more meticulous observer and a more practical anatomist. He was the first to describe mastoiditis and brain abscesses as resulting from suppurating ear infections. Matthew Baillie was another great pathologist in the early 19th century; his book on pathological anatomy was quite famous.</p>
<p>The completion of the invention of the microscope brought about significant advancements in pathology. The progress of one science depends on the inventions of another; this is a common occurrence. Cell theory, embryology, and microscopic anatomy all stemmed from the invention of the microscope. Pathologists began to examine diseased tissues under the microscope using the methods of microscopic anatomy. In 1858, Rudolph Virchow's "Cellular Pathology" was a groundbreaking event in the history of pathology. Note the name: it is a work that discusses the principles of disease based on cells and cellular activities. The influence of this work and its author on medical thought cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>According to Virchow's view, the body is "a cell-state in which every cell is a citizen." Therefore, disease is "a conflict of citizens within the state caused by external forces." He discovered that the cells in the body of a sick person and the cells in the body of a healthy person are not inherently different; the only difference lies in the state of cellular activity, such as the rate and location of growth. "Every cell from a cell" (Omnis cellula e cellula) is Virchow's great biological theory. Therefore, the ancestor of a diseased cell must be a normal cell.</p>
<p>The great value of cellular pathology lies in the unprecedented clarity with which Virchow examined various tissues in various diseases. Virchow’s statements about large cell embolism in pulmonary tuberculosis, cancer cells, cancer metastasis, cardiac parenchyma, lupus, blood clots, migrating cells in inflammation, and other topics are still considered as important as the opinions of current pathologists. Since Virchow's time, pathologists have certainly collected some new techniques and added some bits and pieces here and there, but microscopic pathology had fully matured in 1858, the year Virchow published "Cellular Pathology."</p>
<p>This work laid the foundation for any accurate knowledge of disease. However, we must remember that there are still unavoidable omissions. The changes discovered during anatomical examination cannot explain the entirety of pathology. For example, if a person suffering from abdominal distension, sweating, and fever is found to have a liver abscess after death, the question arises: what caused the liver abscess? Pathological anatomy is only the first step in elucidating the nature of disease; it cannot reveal the cause of organ changes in itself. Or, for example, if a person who suffered from edema and became comatose before death is found to have enlarged, pale, and diseased kidneys after death, we ask: how did the kidney changes cause his coma and how did fluid accumulate in his tissues? This is also something that pathological anatomy cannot reveal. The answers to these questions had to wait for the research of many pathologists after Virchow. The progress of bacteriology, the theory that plant organisms enter the human body and cause changes in tissues, and the invention of theories</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>provided explanations for many causes of diseases previously unknown. The advancements of other sciences, especially chemistry and physics, have enabled specialists to study the chemical changes in diseased tissues and blood.</p>
<p>Thus, today's "pathology" not only includes knowledge of the morphology of diseased tissues (pathological anatomy), but also includes knowledge of the activities of those media that cause tissue changes (bacteriology, parasitology, toxicology, etc.), as well as knowledge of the nature of changes in function, secretion, and chemical reactions of diseased bodies (pathophysiology).</p>
<h3>Methods to Prevent Influenza (Commonly Known as Colds)</h3>
<p>— By Deng, Original Author, Translated by Chen Shengbai</p>
<p>When winter arrives and the climate changes, we find influenza prevalent everywhere. Like other infectious diseases, it is such an unpleasant ailment. Especially regarding its prevention, it is more difficult than other infectious diseases because of the following conditions:</p>
<p>First, because we do not fully know its causative agents, its primary pathogens, and characteristics.</p>
<p>Second, because the disease is transmitted through the air. There are countless healthy or mildly symptomatic carriers. There are sudden outbreaks. Therefore, general infectious disease isolation methods cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Third, because there is still a lack of effective vaccinations like smallpox vaccinations.</p>
<p>However, from the experience gained from the large influenza epidemics in recent years, we are certain that if appropriate preventive measures can be implemented, then there is at least a possibility of reducing the number of cases and the illnesses that develop due to influenza. The goals of prevention are twofold: to prevent transmission and to prevent the onset of the disease. The former refers to how to prevent diseased material from being transmitted to healthy individuals. The latter refers to how to prevent the onset of the disease after infection.</p>
<p>(A) Transmission Prevention Methods</p>
<p>The transmission of this disease is due to the moist secretions of the diseased respiratory tract, through visible and invisible sneezes, coughs, and saliva during conversation, due to direct contact with the patient's air medium, or contact with the patient's hands, towels, and handkerchiefs that have fresh secretions attached. This creates opportunities for infection. Preventive methods can be divided into individual and group methods.</p>
<p>(1) Individual Transmission Prevention</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be known that since influenza prevention is so difficult, individual prevention methods should be formulated by the authorities. Radio broadcasts, newspapers, and leaflets can be used to prepare individuals for the occurrence of the disease on the one hand, and reduce the risk of transmission to others on the other hand. Of course, family consultants and hospital doctors cannot forget their duty to pay attention to the implementation of individual transmission prevention for the health of the people in the entire family and hospital. Here are a few pieces of advice.</p>
<p>Zi: To limit saliva transmission, it is necessary to pay attention to coughing, sneezing, and talking. Talking at a normal distance of two meters can somewhat reduce the chance of transmission.</p>
<p>Chou: To limit contact transmission, one should pay attention to the cleanliness of towels and washcloths and the prohibition of kissing.</p>
<p>Yin: As far as possible, one should avoid air, coughs, conversations, etc., that contain infectious agents.</p>
<p>Mao: Prohibiting visits to the sick is also an important part of transmission prevention. Even when visits to the sick are unavoidable (such as by nurses), face masks should be worn to prevent saliva transmission, or quinine (Chininum, commonly known as quinine sulfate) should be taken internally.</p>
<p>Chen: Wearing a simple disease prevention mask (like the surgical masks used by doctors, lined with two or three layers of sterilized gauze) to block the invasion of saliva is certainly a reasonable and appropriate individual prevention method.</p>
<p>Yi: Some people can escape to places where there is no or very little influenza to avoid the chance of infection. If prophylactic use of oral quinine is also possible, it is even more appropriate. As for traveling during the epidemic period, it must of course be considered.</p>
<p>(2) Group Transmission Prevention</p>
<p>We know that group transmission prevention should be carried out by the authorities, hospitals, and doctors through consistent rules and certain steps to achieve the goal of unified control. The following are a few key points:</p>
<p>Zi: Propaganda: The first step in group transmission prevention is to promote individual transmission prevention methods within the group.</p>
<p>Chou: During the relevant period, it is best to close schools or playgrounds, because this prevents people from having contact and gathering opportunities, which means preventing people from transmitting the disease to each other.</p>
<p>Yin: Isolation of patients is an essential strategy for prevention. In places of group living such as the military and schools, the health of individuals should be checked at any time, and detailed reports should be made at any time.</p>
<p>Mao: The equipment in the isolation room of the hospital. This also means isolation.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(75) Trichiasis</p>
<p>Fine hairs growing on the edge of the upper and lower eyelids are what we call eyelashes. Like eyebrows, they enhance the beauty of the face, especially for women. European and American eyelashes grow particularly long compared to those of Chinese people, so the eyes of European and American women seem even more glamorous. Regarding the direction of eyelashes, they normally point forward uniformly, without touching the eyeball. However, if trichiasis occurs, the direction of the eyelashes can change, turning from forward to backward, and their arrangement also becomes irregular. At this time, the eyelashes touch the eyeball, often causing symptoms of irritation to the eyeball, causing photophobia, tearing, and redness. Because the cornea is repeatedly rubbed by the eyelashes, the surface layer of the cornea can often become cloudy, and sometimes it can even lead to corneal ulcers or Pannus (Pannus means that the epithelium of the cornea becomes hypertrophic and at the same time causes the growth of new blood vessels. It is most common when suffering from trachoma), and other dangerous complications, and the patient will feel blurred vision, or even blindness. Misdirected eyelashes are usually shorter and thicker than healthy ones, or like fine, pale vellus hairs. The location of misdirection is not fixed. Sometimes it only occupies part of the eyelid margin, and sometimes it can reach the entire eyelid margin. This depends entirely on the severity of the misdirection. Furthermore, eyelashes can often grow together in two rows, front and back. The eyelashes in the back row mostly point backwards. This condition is specifically called distichiasis, and its symptoms are the same as those of trichiasis.</p>
<p>The causes of trichiasis are congenital and acquired, but based on clinical observations, the latter is more common. Among the acquired causes, trachoma is the most important, because when suffering from severe trachoma, the conjunctiva and cartilage undergo cicatricial contraction, causing the eyelids to bend, and the eyelid margin to press against the eyeball. Patients often suffer from tearing, and the eyelids become eroded due to the moisture of tears, and trichiasis often occurs at this time. Other conditions such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, pathological neoplasms of the eyelids, and scars caused by ulcers or trauma can also cause trichiasis.</p>
<p>The prevention of trichiasis is to quickly eliminate the acquired causes. For example, when suffering from diseases such as trachoma, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis, treatment should be sought immediately to avoid causing this condition. The treatment for this condition is that when only a small number of eyelashes are misdirected, tweezers can be used to pull out the misdirected eyelashes one by one. If they repeatedly grow back in the wrong direction, then an ophthalmologist should perform electrolysis to achieve a radical cure.</p>
<h3>Our Understanding of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Amidst the Anti-Tuberculosis Movement (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>(E) Public Health: Improve sanitary facilities in schools, factories, and other places; inspect food such as milk; popularize common-sense hygiene education to make the general public understand the horror of pulmonary tuberculosis, but also understand that early treatment offers hope of recovery; establish anti-tuberculosis hospitals for compulsory isolation (to be implemented by government order); establish anti-tuberculosis clinics to provide free physical examinations and X-ray examinations; implement health insurance; and support anti-sputum associations by providing material and spiritual assistance (effective only through the concerted efforts of agriculture, industry, commerce, education, military, and the government). Health administrative agencies should send doctors, nurses, and health police to investigate households for tuberculosis patients or suspected cases, and immediately send them to anti-tuberculosis hospitals. Cooks suffering from coughs should be sent to anti-tuberculosis hospitals to prevent the spread of disease, which is of utmost importance (I once saw two cooks in a restaurant suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, using them to prepare food. Isn't that extremely dangerous?).</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>In recent treatments for pulmonary tuberculosis, the outline focuses on six principles. If the patient can be patient and enduring, willing to cooperate, and careful and conscientious without the slightest negligence, the disease will surely progress and gradually improve. These are described in detail below: (A) Absolute rest: According to modern medical research, rest is of paramount importance for tuberculosis patients. There are four reasons for this: Rest can reduce the body's consumption; slow blood circulation prevents the spread of tubercle bacilli and the diffusion of toxins throughout the body; reducing blood pressure can prevent hemoptysis; and reducing fever can prevent the spread of lesions, allowing damaged areas to form scar tissue.</p>
<p>(B) Abundant nutrition: Tuberculosis patients consume a great deal of energy. If measures are not taken to replenish it, the overall condition will deteriorate, leading to unimaginable crises. Now, choose nutritious foods and give them to patients to increase their weight, which is of great benefit to the recovery of the body. However, the following matters must be noted: Take easily digestible foods, such as one pound of milk per day (the best), two to six eggs per day, and other foods such as vegetables, fruits, beef, and liver, all of which must be allocated for consumption; abolish all snacks between meals and eat with moderation; three meals a day should be at fixed times, with at least four hours between each meal; chew food carefully and do not devour it; do not exercise or use your brain before or after eating, and do not eat when depressed; and pay attention to your digestive capacity.</p>
<p>(C) Fresh air and sunlight: Tubercle bacilli dislike oxygen and fear sunlight, so patients should live in a place with fresh air. Sunlight is rich in ultraviolet rays, which have bactericidal power, so the patient's residence or bedroom should be exposed to sunlight as much as possible. However, direct exposure often easily increases the patient's body temperature and induces hemoptysis, so it should not be easily attempted.</p>
<p>(D) Appropriate education: Make the patient understand the causes, symptoms, and principles of prevention and treatment of the disease, and cooperate with the doctor, which is of great benefit to preventing the disease.</p>
<p>(E) Skilled surgery: With the advancement of modern medicine, in addition to internal medicine treatment, surgical treatment can be used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis. According to the different conditions of the disease and the different physical strength of the patients, different treatment methods are adapted: Artificial Pneumothorax; Thoracoplasty; Phrenicectomy; Oleo-thorax.</p>
<p>(F) Proper medication: Under the guidance of a formal doctor, take proper and reliable medications as a supplement. If you do not examine the contents and see exaggerated advertisements for over-the-counter drugs or secret medicines made by unscrupulous merchants, which often contain narcotics, be sure to avoid taking them internally. Over time, addiction will develop, which will be harmful to the body. You must choose carefully. Medications used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis generally include the following: Calcium preparations, whether injected or taken internally, can increase the calcium content in the blood and help the lung damage form calcification, encapsulate the lesions, and cause scarring. This type of preparation has many types, and is usually mixed with glucose to make injection solutions or tablets. Cod liver oil, although it can be classified as food, most cod liver oils contain iodine and phosphorus. Taking it not only makes people fat and increases weight, but also contains a lot of vitamin D, which greatly helps the metabolism of calcium in the body. In addition to cod liver oil, the newly released halibut liver oil is more effective and is excellent for patients to take. Cressate and similar preparations have a bactericidal effect on the lungs. Taking them can reduce the complexity of the lung condition, and the complications or aftereffects are also reduced. Liver preparations, taken internally or injected, can replenish blood, and tuberculosis patients often have anemia. Treating it with it is also quite effective. Cough suppressants and expectorants should be free of narcotics. If it is necessary to contain narcotics, follow the doctor's advice and supervision, and use them properly. There are many other types of medicines. If you only have a superficial understanding and prescribe medicines indiscriminately, the danger is truly infinite. Be careful and refrain from doing so.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Teeth (15)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 84) How does chronic apical periodontitis form?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the acute symptoms disappear, it is often because the root canal is not completely treated, pus still exists, or the pus in the alveolar bone is not completely cleared, resulting in constant pus flow. In addition, pus bacteria often hide in a small, tough cyst that is not easily eradicated by medicine. After the affected tooth is extracted, what is attached to the root is the cause of chronic apical periodontitis. Those who do not know often mistakenly believe it to be attached gum tissue, but it is actually the pathogen of chronic apical periodontitis. This disease can also be called Chronic Alveolar Abscess.</p>
<p>(Question 85) What are the symptoms of chronic apical periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) A small amount of pus often flows out of the root canal, or a sinus tract forms and flows out of the gum near the root tip of the affected tooth. The affected tooth feels slightly sore, soft, and loose, and its color is dull and dark. The affected gum is deep red. However, because the patient does not feel much pain, they often do not pay attention to it, and may not even know that the disease exists and pus is flowing out. However, if the sinus tract is blocked or the bone inflammation recurs, all the symptoms will become severe again. It is also possible to revert to the acute form when the body is weak.</p>
<p>(Question 86) What dangers can chronic apical periodontitis cause?</p>
<p>(Answer) The toxins in the pus it produces every day are either directly absorbed or absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after the pus is swallowed. Over time, it can cause various systemic diseases, such as gastrointestinal diseases, arthritis, lung diseases, eye diseases, brain diseases, etc. Patients often do not know that the source of their illness is in the mouth, and often treat the symptoms rather than the root cause, and it takes a long time to heal.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Against Russia?</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Minister will propose to our country, based on the third section of the so-called "Three-Point Policy" on the "Foundation of Sino-Japanese Relations" proposed to our country, to demand that Soviet Russia open up Outer Mongolia to allow other foreign countries. If Soviet Russia refuses, it will form the so-called "Sino-Japanese Military Alliance" to jointly resist the Soviet Russianization of Outer Mongolia. The Japanese Foreign Minister said: The North China problem has now been satisfactorily resolved (!) Outer Mongolia, under the instructions of Soviet Russia, is politically, economically, and socially isolated from the world. Therefore, China and Japan should jointly demand that Soviet Russia open it up. Since Japan believes that the North China problem has been satisfactorily resolved, Outer Mongolia has naturally become its next target of attack.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, Japan has always brandished the banner of "anti-Soviet" to cover up the selfishness of the great powers and secretly seize Chinese territory on a large scale. This is common knowledge among those who discuss international issues. Now Japan is copying old articles again. In fact, its real goal is most of the land in northern China near Outer Mongolia, from Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Shaanxi to Xinjiang. This is what it really wants, and occupying Mongolia is secondary (of course, the anti-Soviet mission has not been relaxed. However, at present, when the Soviet Union's peaceful forces in the Far East still exceed Japan's war power, Japan is unwilling to take the risk of acting first. Attacking the Soviet Union is its ultimate goal, and invading China is its initial step). Now that the North China problem has been satisfactorily resolved, naturally, all the land north of the Yellow River in China must also be "satisfactorily resolved" in order. And the remedy for this solution is "China and Japan jointly anti-Russian"!</p>
<p>From a common-sense perspective, what a country should "defend" against is the aggressive country that is invading it. Jointly anti-Russian, is Russia now carrying out a fierce invasion of our country? Or other countries? If we say that China wants to defend against foreign countries, then the first thing is to resist the country that is invading us fiercely! This is what is called "even a three-foot-tall child knows it." To say that we should "cooperate," "befriend," or even "ally" with a country that is invading us fiercely to attack another country that has not invaded us, what is the result? It will be that the cooperated, befriended, and allied countries will be completely transformed into the protectorate of our cooperator, befriender, and ally! There is no other way! Then drive the people of the allied countries to act as cannon fodder to attack the country that the active ally wants to attack. The content of jointly anti-Russian is originally like this!</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>The night in December is like a desolate suburb lying under the dim sky. There are no stars or moon in the sky. Although it has not yet snowed, the sharp north wind is whistling fiercely. There are only a few pedestrians. In the distance, the cries of night vendors pass by, knocking on clappers, adding to the miserable atmosphere. At the end of the street, there is a row of dense, uneven thatched houses, with the eaves close together. Homeless vagrants, like beetles, crouch and curl up, picking up fuel materials such as grass stalks, paper balls, and peanut shells by the roadside. Three or five of them gather in front of the door of a thatched house, throw the things they picked up in a pile, strike a match, and light them. Then, those things burn, slowly burning more and more, and the red, blazing flames rise higher and higher, wave after wave. A group of people squeeze together, exhaling, and drops of water drip from their noses. They stretch out their frozen hands and frantically rub them to warm them.</p>
<p>Because it is cold, the tall constable has disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Fire, fire, fire, burning. Find some more things to add to it, and the fire becomes even more violent. The fire then spread to the thatched roof. The thatched roof is on fire.</p>
<p>Disaster, an instinctive fear. The vagrants all disappeared in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the fire swept over the thatched houses one by one. By the time the people in the houses realized it and ran out, their thatched houses were already trapped in a blazing inferno.</p>
<p>Towering red sparks filled the entire space.</p>
<p>Under the illumination of the firelight: people's voices are chaotic, and footsteps are hurried. A strong man ran out in his pajamas, only to realize that he had dropped someone in the fire, so he rushed in and dragged out a boy with a scorched head. Some were wearing single shirts and grabbing something in their hands, jumping around. Some old women fell on the roadside, spitting saliva in a semi-conscious state. Some children could not find their fathers. Mothers could not find their daughters.</p>
<p>A chaotic cry mixed with wailing shouts, mixed with the rushing sound of water spraying from the rubber hoses of the water dragons.</p>
<p>People watching the fire scene filled both sides of the street. A large team of free cars came. Indian Asans grabbed leather whips and dashed forward majestically, whipping people's bodies and driving them away. The stronger the north wind blew, the less the fire subsided. With the help of the wind, it was even more proud to drag past the thatched houses, spreading without limit.</p>
<p>Firefighters wearing copper hats, holding long hoes, chased it and rushed ahead to destroy the houses that had not yet caught fire, blocking its path. But a gust of strong wind came, helping its momentum, and it could roll into the air. It burned with crackling sounds.</p>
<p>The miserable cries and wails, along with the newly ignited fire, once again mixed and filled people's ears. The red cross ambulance, with its sharp copper bell ringing, was the busiest, opening empty cars and carrying a carload of people burned by the fire.</p>
<p>The water on the street flooded like a river.</p>
<p>The wind was slightly smaller, and the flames were also slightly tired. In the cold and desolate night, the many thatched houses had turned into a scattered piece of scorched earth. Then, the tragic cries began again. In the cold and desolate night, the home was destroyed, the son was gone, buried in the volcano, the wife was gone, taken to the Red Cross, seriously injured, I don't know myself. But someone found a box desperately carried out of the fire. In the chaos, the fire bird stole it.</p>
<p>The home is gone. Temporarily lie across the street corner in December for one night. But where to go tomorrow?</p>
<h3>Goddess</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zuo</p>
<p>"Rebellious traitors! Where do you think you can escape to? Heavenly punishment is coming soon! The Son of Heaven's divine army is about to arrive!" Zhuanxu's face was full of smug grin, holding up a bloody bronze knife, roaring like a mad dog, and leading his party to rush towards Buzhou Mountain. (Seventeen)</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Tomorrow, looking at the shattered pieces and ashes of the home, and digging out some burned, blurred corpses from the ashes, recognize them, but it's not clear, and who is missing from yourself? Maybe it's your own children, your own relatives, or maybe it's the neighbor.</p>
<p>Then, everyone dispersed from here, and another group of unfortunate people was added to the vast sea of people.</p>
<h3>"Old Man" Shop</h3>
<p>— Tang Wen</p>
<p>It was late December, the sky was pitch black, the wind was howling on the top of the mountain, and the withered tree branches made sharp cries like ghosts. There was not a single night walker on the mountain road. Occasionally, one or two dog barks broke the lonely space. At the foot of the mountain, there was a swaying light, which was the door light of the inn that recruited merchants here. The shopkeeper was an old man who was good at doing business. He ran this inn in the deep mountains with a not-very-smart waiter. Because this mountain road was the main road between the provincial capital and Tai'an, there were traveling merchant teams passing through it all year round. He took hold of this key point to do a steady business. The porters between the provincial capital and Tai'an all knew this old man. Sometimes, when they wholesale goods from the provincial capital to Tai'an to do business, or collect agricultural products from Tai'an to send to the provincial capital, and they didn't have any extra money on the road, the old man would always gently agree to the merchants' requests and temporarily write the account on the water sign. When they sold the goods and returned, they would pay it back. Therefore, there was a saying in the porters' language, "stay at the old man's," which meant to stay at the old man's inn.</p>
<p>The old man's business had two fixed times every day: one was lunch at noon, and the other was lodging at sunset, because this mountain road was halfway between the provincial capital and Tai'an. If you set off in the morning, you would have lunch at the old man's shop and arrive at your destination in the evening. If you set off in the afternoon, you would have to stay at the old man's shop. As the lunar year drew to a close, there were even more merchant teams traveling on this mountain road. Those who collected debts and those who bought goods were all busy with the year-end settlement. The old man urged the waiter to slaughter pigs and cook vegetables early every morning. As soon as the sun hit the middle of the sky, he would put his dry tobacco pouch in his mouth and stroll to the door, looking around in both directions. When he saw the shadows of donkey carts and porters, he would raise his dry tobacco pouch to greet them. Sometimes, when he was happy, he would run three to two hundred steps to meet his patrons. The patrons at the end of the year were all rich people. After letting the animals rest, they would shout for meat and wine to have a full meal. The old man had decades of experience in running an inn. He raised several pigs and brewed several urns of wine, all in preparation for the year-end business. At ordinary times, he was as shrewd as a businessman. A dish of pickles and three large bowls of white rice, and a tael or two of white water wine were already good patrons. At the end of the year, no matter whether they were doing big business or carrying goods, what they hid in their pockets was money. Businessmen who had worked hard for a year would drink some sorghum and chew a big piece of meat as "New Year's money" - this was a business superstition. Those who made money would eat big fish and big meat, and those who didn't make money would also have to chew on something decent, otherwise they wouldn't be able to do good business next year.</p>
<p>But this year, something strange happened. This mountain road, which had been safe since the beginning of history, had several robberies this year. The provincial capital had sent security teams to station at the key points of the road, but the robbers in both large and small robberies were elusive and could not be caught. The old man shook his head and sighed: "People's hearts are not as good as they used to be, and the world is declining!" He had read books, and he understood this. He was worried that a robbery might happen in his shop one day. In that case, the money he had accumulated through decades of hard work would be wasted, and this stable business would be unable to continue. Now, wouldn't those merchant teams rather take the two-day waterway to the provincial capital? The old man was terrified. Every day, he put his dry tobacco pouch in his mouth and stood at the door of the shop, looking at the top of the mountain - in fact, he was looking at the sun. Noon had passed, and there were no merchants for lunch. He hoped that the sun would set a little later. Once the sun set, his hope was over. There were no merchants even on good years and good days. Would there be anyone traveling at night this year? But it was useless. The end of the lunar year quickly arrived. Several urns of good wine had not been opened. So, one morning, the old man ran to the provincial capital in a fit of anger. When he returned to the shop, he brought two security team members with box cannons at their waists. The old man seemed exceptionally excited. As he stepped into the shop, he shouted loudly to the waiter:</p>
<p>"Little Maozi, quickly slaughter a big rooster, open an urn of wine, and the two old commanders will stay in our shop for a long time."</p>
<p>The old man's face was beaming. Occasionally, when a merchant came to have lunch or stay overnight, he would point to the two security team members and say: "What are you afraid of? The old commanders are staying in our shop! Taking the two-day waterway to the provincial capital is the idea of a devil's son. I, the old man, have been doing business for decades and have never had an accident, old commander, what do you say?"</p>
<p>The old commanders smiled. They had wine and meat every day, so what accident could there be?</p>
<h3>After Waking</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>I woke up.</p>
<p>The bed is close to the window. Through the glass panes, I can see the sky in the middle of December night. The moonlight quietly and gently brings a piece of desolation to the bedside. Outside the window, the wind has stopped and the trees are still. Even the cold dogs don’t make a single shivering sound. Everything is asleep and still, letting the night frost shrink all sounds and all tremors.</p>
<p>Looking at the small round top of the mosquito net above, loneliness and solitude give me a desolate mood. This small room, no, this small bed, it is too empty, too cold. This deep night, what accompanies me is only this small round top of the mosquito net and a piece of cold moonlight; even dreams have abandoned me, so I move my eyes to the outside of the window again, that corner of the night sky, almost becoming a still blue sea, it is boundless and deep, without shores, and I am a boat on the sea.</p>
<p>However, I saw a few stars, aren’t they a little bit of pearly hope? Alas, dear old friends, have you not forgotten me either? You keep squinting your smiling eyes at me, do you want to secretly tell me everything in the past? I finally sighed greatly, I remember the starry night sky and the moonlit sky in my hometown in autumn… all these beautiful dreams are now crushed under the wheel teeth of time, the scenery remains the same but it is the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>The ticking sound of the small clock on the table clearly drags time by one second and one minute. What time is it now, is it almost dawn? I’m really a little anxious, this little clock won’t ring out the numbers for me to hear. I thought of the old grandfather clock in my home, in the quiet and deeper half of the night, that clang clang sound of the clock, how leisurely and distant it sounded. Who has ever been frightened by this wonderful sound and the sound of the clock? I don’t believe it! However, tonight is just as deep, just as quiet, just as waking up from a dream, I can only sleep coldly in an inn in a foreign land and miss the old grandfather clock.</p>
<p>The sound of the train comes from far away, which night train is running again. I thought of several friends who were forced by life to scatter and embark on a journey, they are also happy outcasts, are they also awake tonight like me? Oh, life, let me bless them.</p>
<h3>Let Me Return to the South</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Facing this snowy winter, the days when the north wind is blowing like a sharp knife, the dark sky, the world has really become a terrifying ruin, what else is worth people to miss? Let me return to the South! South, the hometown where I grew up! There, on the side of the vast sea and sky, there is always warm sunshine, gentle seasonal winds, and lakes rippling with brocade ripples in the breeze. In winter, all the beautiful scenery is still preserved. The plums are still blooming with a tree of pink flowers, white flowers, and variegated flowers, and the fragrance is scattered across the fields outside the city. These are all things that make people forever tired and unforgettable. And in the home, there is more intimate laughter, intimate words, and the passionate faces of more lovely family members… But will the winter days in this northern country have green leaves and fragrant plums? The sky is always melancholy, placing a bronze color, and the last petal of the tree leaf also rolls into the ditch. Soon it will be the time when even the river and creek will freeze into ice beds. Let me return to the South! I am willing to die in the place where I grew up, and I have tasted enough of the taste of a wanderer these days. The long wandering life has already broken the dreams of young people, the aspirations of young people, and aged the heart of youth. I am feeling unusually tired, but this is ultimately just a fantasy, in this cold wind, in the snowy days, I still have to run around all day long. I don't know why I am busy all day long. If it is said to be for life, it is really too boring, and my energy is almost unable to support it anymore. If it is still like this, maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, I will collapse decadently. I really need a gentle environment to rest quietly. I yearn for the South, the place where I grew up!</p>
<p>Let me return to the South. The colors of this city make people extremely disgusted, and the winter days in this northern country make people feel bored and uninteresting. In the South, I can restore a peaceful mind, restore spiritual balance, and regain the old fallen dreams, there are things I love.</p>
<p>Let me return to the South.</p>

<p>Opening Verse: "The Widow"</p>
<p>The courtyard is deep and quiet, the moon is dim. A poor widow guards her room. Her face is pale without makeup. A long sigh, tears stream down her face. Dressed in plain clothes, her eyebrows lowered. Silently, she says nothing. Thinking back to the beginning,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Gentle as water, deeply pitying my concubine. My concubine's heart is as soft as cotton, loving my husband deeply. I hoped to raise our bowls together, eyebrows raised, and grow old together. A loving couple spent their time together. Who knew that flowers have no constant beauty, and the moon often wanes? Alas, your vitality couldn't sustain you, and you died so suddenly. I should have followed you down to the springs below. In the darkness, we could have poured out our hearts to each other. But because my parents-in-law are old. There is no one to care for these aging elders. Therefore, I sadly and depressedly prolong my remaining breath. I listlessly eat my meals alone. I stare intently at your vivid image. Why are you always smiling at my mother? I watch my youth and beauty wither away. My fading appearance is no longer beautiful. I sleep in the empty room, as desolate as iron. The phoenix is gone from the bamboo, leaving a lonely phoenix. The bitterness of my sorrowful state is like bitter tea. How can I stop my aching heart? My grievances fill my heart, with whom can I share them? The more I think, the more heartbroken I become. My delicate throat bursts into loud sobs. Startling the little birds on the branches, who all fly away. The parrot does not understand human sorrow. It imitates the weeping and crying sounds in front of the curtain. It cries until its voice is hoarse, its strength is exhausted, and it faints. It falls on the cold bed and cannot get up. Truly, death and separation are like a dream.</p>

<p>Xia Hesheng's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Verse: "Three Smiles and Spotting Autumn"</p>
<p>Luring the tiger from the mountain is the best plan. I laugh at Tang Yin for being so pretentious. Saying that Zhishan lured him to Suzhou. I am doing this because I am deeply grateful and dare not refuse. The gentleman listens, and is extremely angry. He hates the wild scholar's extravagant actions. You are just a scholar. Where would you find twelve women with golden hairpins lined up in two rows? It's not that I'm boasting today. Among the maids, there are only beautiful women. It wouldn't hurt to have the servant choose. He quickly summoned the housekeeper and the old woman. He ordered all the maids in the mansion to be gathered. He waited for the selection from the screen to form a pair. Good things are often delayed, as they say. Peaches and plums show their colors. Only the queen of flowers does not come out. Perhaps she is not yet dressed at this moment. Let's just choose ordinary flowers at random. We'll judge the slender swallows and the plump Yangs. After selecting several people, the day was already late. He felt listless and uneasy. Hongshan saw through the scholar's intention. He went into the room to discuss with his wife. The wife gave a test to the servant boy. She said, "It's like waiting for red lotus to welcome the summer rain." But he wants to climb the cassia tree and pluck the fragrance of autumn. This boy has a sharp eye indeed. He knew the key was in the pomegranate. He shook the bottle and smashed it, making a splashing sound. He closed the room, cried to death, and then came back to life.</p>

<h3>Zhou Xuan Teases the Fat Man</h3>
<p>——In "The Night of the Wedding Candles"——</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the filming of Guan Hongda reciting his lessons in "The Night of the Wedding Candles," laughter filled the entire studio. The atmosphere was extremely relaxed and harmonious. What was the reason? Let me tell you:——</p>
<p>It turns out that Guan Hongyuan plays a young master of the Li family in "The Night of the Wedding Candles," but he is extremely stupid. His father (played by Jiang Xiu) is very sad to see this, but he has no choice but to teach him so that he can barely succeed through guidance. He could never remember the last character "Li" in the phrase "Zhao Qian Sun Li". Jiang Xiu explained, "It's the 'Li' of our surname Li." He also replied, "It's the 'Li' of our surname Li." Jiang Xiu said, "Are you so stupid?" He also repeated, "Are you so stupid?" Jiang Xiu, seeing this situation, couldn't help but sigh and shake his head as he walked out. But he still ran on the ground, repeating "Are you so stupid?" incessantly. At this time, his family's maid (played by Zhou Xuan) came out and, seeing the situation, tiptoed closer to the table, raised her arms in Jiang Xiu's manner, and shouted, "It's the 'cow' of stupid cow."</p>
<p>In between, there was an infinitely comical performance, the scene of a mischievous little maid teasing a clumsy young master, enough to make people burst into laughter and hurt their stomachs.</p>
<h3>The "Record of Loyal Souls" Showing at Cathay is</h3>
<p>A Tense Patriotic Film</p>
<p>The "Record of Loyal Souls" Brown On Resolution, produced by the British Gaumont Company, is currently showing at the Cathay Grand Theater and is one of the greatest works on the European screen in 1935. This is a thrilling and tense patriotic military film, depicting an English hero, who, trapped in the enemy's clutches, is able to make a final struggle, sacrificing his personal life to obtain the highest price. His sincere patriotism is enough to move heaven and earth. The film's description of new naval tactics, its magnificent scenes, and the intensity of the battles, are unprecedented on the silver screen. This is truly a patriotic film that must be seen.</p>
<h3>"Sweet Sweet" Published</h3>
<p>Written by Zhou Tianlai, the whole book is written in lively and fluent language, with a naive and lively writing style, and the conclusion is filled with new attitudes and new discoveries. The book uses a ten-year-old child as the protagonist, setting off countless small companions and observing the social scene, which is unusually sophisticated and full of fun, not only cultivating children's creative interests, but also moving adults to return to the innocent ranks. The whole book contains more than 130,000 words, in a large hardcover volume, divided into four categories: correspondence, diary, essays, and travel notes. It is exquisitely illustrated by W. Buffoon, bound by Zhang Yingchao, and titled by Feng Zikai. The actual price is five jiao per book, eighty percent off for five or more books. The publisher is Wenguang Bookstore, No. 3 Yideli, Laobeimenwai Street, French Concession. The distributor is No. 480 Fuzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Grand Light Screenings of Blockbusters</h3>
<p>The Grand Light Theater is showing blockbusters in a row during the New Year. After "Little Overlord," it is followed by Magran Sullivan's "Tears of Love and Iron Hooves" So ked the Rose. This is a tragic and moving historical romance film, directed by Shang Yijinduo. Since its premiere, it has been very crowded. It is also said that after the end of this film, the theater will continue to show the tragic blockbuster "Jade Tragedy and Floral Sorrow" Mary Burns Fugitive. This is an unprecedented masterpiece by the tragic star Sheryl Wicksnail that overwhelms "Madame Butterfly." When it premiered in the United States, it broke all box office records.</p>
<h3>Star Magazine</h3>
<p>The glass shed newly built by Star Second Factory was completed a few days ago. The first film shot in the new shed was "Love Letter," directed by Li Pingqian.</p>
<p>"Love Letter" will be renamed "Peach and Plum Compete for Beauty." Currently, it's not doing well. Please approve it centrally.</p>
<p>"Spring Flower" and "Brothers in Action" are both about to be completed. "Spring Flower" only has a few outdoor scenes left, which will be taken in Hangzhou with the "Love Letter" outdoor scene crew recently.</p>
<p>When filming the scene of Sun Min's mansion in "Spring Flower," the set was very old and poor, a small Western-style house with all the necessary furnishings. In addition to his love for women, Sun Min also likes pugs and kittens. Director Wu Cun went to the City God Temple yesterday to buy two parrots to decorate the scene.</p>
<p>Because the background of "Robbery After Peach Blossom" is Qingdao, the decorations are mostly Japanese-style, such as cafes and dance halls.</p>
<p>Fan Ying plays Hu Die's second husband in "Brothers in Action." He has a staunch personality. In a scene shot a few days ago where he reprimands his son, his words were heavy and stern, moving the listeners.</p>
