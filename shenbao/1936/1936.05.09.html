<p>— 紀</p>
<p>自東菲戰事急轉直下意軍侵阿到了最後關頭的時候歐洲形勢起了幾個主要的變化第一是國際聯盟的崩續歐洲各弱小國家如挪威芬蘭瑞典丹麥荷蘭五國都準備相繼退出國聯而另成一北歐集團這一舉動不但削弱國聯最後機搆的應用而且也削弱英國在北歐的政治上的控制能力第二是巴爾幹小恊的諸國如希臘士耳其羅馬尼亞南期拉夫常設政治會議的召集協商各國所負軍事上相互義務問題海峽重行設防問題外交共同陣綫問題意國侵入阿爾巴尼亞問題以及萊茵河和德奧合併匈波接近匃牙利正式擴軍等問題</p>
<p>這兩個主要的變化是互相關聯的總括的一句話就是戰後歐洲維持均勢的局面已到了最後的動搖時期國聯不足恃英法諸强國不足以保障歐洲的和平宛如風中之燭非自力不足以圖存非集體的力量不足以抵禦外來的侵略因此種客觀的情勢就產生了區域安全制度</p>
<p>我們且放下北歐問題不談單就巴爾幹問題來講其所處的地位的確是可慮的自從德軍開入萊茵區域以後德國國社黨的政策竭力由奧國向巴爾幹諸國發展以圖伸張其勢力於地中海沉寂已久的德奧合併問題近來又趨緊張且有旦夕卽將實現的傳說同時匃奧也正式要求擴充軍備恢復徵兵制德國與保加利亞的秘密軍事結合也日慚公開這不但使小恊的與巴爾幹諸國感受嚴重的威脅而且使保加利亞對於一九三四年一月巴爾幹諸國成立公的時所提出的三項要求（　保障巴爾幹諸國境內保加利亞民族敎育宗敎與語言的自由　軍備的平等　通至愛琴海的土地　態度更加强硬於是巴爾幹小協的諸國就發生了共同的利害關係</p>
<p>在意大利方面因侵阿軍事的勝利必然地加强它打破現狀的决心此後對付★巴爾幹和中歐諸國的政策必更向獨佔的路上走意大利的侵略主義者一向對於巴爾幹的團結運動表示不滿意的它們認爲唯有古羅馬的聲勢才能使巴爾幹半島得到永久的和平它們不但耍求達爾馬興海岸的政治支配權和阿爾巴尼亞的全部支配權而且渴望着希臘的柯爾阜（Capfce)因此使與希臘昆連的士耳其在地中海方面的防務也威受了空虛遂不得不提出恢復達達尼爾海峽設防的要求</p>
<p>戰後的巴爾幹小協的諸國一向是投奔於國聯而依附於法國之下的自從去年一月法意羅馬協定以來事實上法國已失去其領導的能力巴爾幹的地位處於意德英法四國圍攻之中其情形的複雜與局勢的嚴重實在並不亞於萊茵河問題與奧國問題此决會議的召集無疑地是爲着解决這種困難的形勢而謀四國間的密切團結的</p>
<p>現在巴爾幹協的國政治會議已告結束而調整歐洲局勢正在積極的進展中今後的巴爾幹問題將益趨複雜了</p>

<h3 id="c41">答覆希特勒建議英政府備忘錄公布　提出問題表包含十一項措辭委婉要求補充說明 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府對於三月三十一日德國備忘錄所提出之問題表、今日用白皮書形式發表、除序言而外、共載有要點十一項、措詞尙屬委婉、一方面對於備忘錄若干點、曁德國當局所發表之宣言、表示滿意、一方面對於其他各點則要求補充說明、或要求加以修正、茲摘錄原文如下、</p>
<p>序言　英國政府深願歐洲各國能以相互承認獨立權與平等權利、並相互尊重其所接受之義務、並能以此為基礎、而樹立眞正持久的和平、但英德兩國、卽當進行範圍廣大之談判、自以恢復信用心為主要條件、德國政府於此、未能切實有所貢獻、甚以為憾、</p>
<p>問題表主文　　目下德國是吾願與關係各國締結誠實的條約</p>
<p>德國主張應將凡爾賽　的、曁由凡爾賽和約所產生各項條約、一概予以廢止、其所提出之論據、英國政府未敢贊同、</p>
<p>按之德國備忘錄第四項、「德國政府與德國民族顯有區別之處」似此眞正問題乃在目下德國對於歐洲政治的領土的現狀、是吾認為業已達到可以承認、並加以尊重之地步、其有認為不滿者、能吾與關係各國進行自由的談判、以冀成立協定而有以改正之、（卽不逕自改正之謂）</p>
<p>德國希特勒元首、前於去年五月二十一日在衆議院發表演說時、曾提議締結西歐天空公的、但不主張成立區域的天空軍備限制協定、以補天空公的之不足、此乃英國政府引以為憾者、</p>
<p>德國政府願與法比兩國商訂二十五年互不侵犯公的、而以英意兩國為担保國、此項公的究應以何種方式出之、須俟進行談判之後始可加以確定、凡此英國政府均巳備案、</p>
<p>德國凖備與東南東北部隣近各國商訂互不侵犯公的、此層英國政府亦巳備案、幷表示滿意、但此項　的能吾以互助協定充實之、英國政府亦欲知之、</p>
<p>「德國政府旣已聲明亟願重返國聯會、英國政府因而相信、德國所建議之雙方互不侵犯公的、必可與國聯會會員國所擔負之集體安全義務互相融合、幷相信此項公的、可在國聯會盟的範圍內運用之、不致發生何項困難、」</p>
<p>德國願與東南東北部隣近各國、商訂互不侵犯公的、固矣、所謂「東南東北部隣近各國」除直接毘隣各國之外、倘能包括蘇俄，拉特維亞·愛沙尼亞三國在內、則歐洲各項問題之解决、自必大形便利、此乃英國政府所深信者、</p>
<p>德國希特勒元首前於去年五月二十一日在衆議院發表演說、有云、「德國隨時均可簽訂國際公的、用以防止干涉他國內政舉動、英國政府茲樂於重申之、</p>
<p>德國所建議之國際仲裁法庭如何、英國政府茲特要求加以說明、幷聲明海牙方面已有國際常設法庭、</p>
<p>關於國聯會盟的與凡爾賽和的相分離一層、內容如何、英國政府深願德國政府補充說明之、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間今日得悉、英國駐德大使斐潑斯爵士提交德外長牛賴特之問題表、意在試探德元首希特勒對於一般問題之眞意、表中對於殖民地問題一概未予提及、蓋英國此時實不願討論恢復德國已失領土之問題也、且希望德國將來當能遵守國際義務、尊重奧國之獨立及米美爾與但澤自由城之法律地位云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>— 荘學本</p>
<p>（三）羣科灘蒙旂</p>
<p>未赴柴達木　「柴達木「盆地占着靑海全省三分之一的幅　、那裹靠近新疆、有純粹遊牧的蒙古民族、氣候溫暖、有已經墾植的農田、但是沙漠　地、人煙寥落、所以遊人商　進去的很少、政治勢力、也還沒有伸展進去、大好的原野至今、仍是一塊荒凉的白地、我從塔爾寺回到西寗以後、抱着侵入這一塊白地考察蒙古民族和地理的野心、但是那裏隔着西寗有十幾個馬站、一路都是荒郊、須自己携帶帳篷、道中不靖、須隨帶槍械、或有軍　護送、不是一個空手的人能隨便來去的、當時我同軍部交涉了一下、他們很願意派一個通蒙語的副官、二個衛兵、和二匹騎馬、護送我們、所以我們將路上一切應用的物件都預備好了等着、一速過了十二天、軍部中的副官一時還派不出來、多數因公出差了、所賸的幾個、祇能番語而不能象語、他們還是堅留多住幾天、</p>
<p>二月二十日的早上、我們焦灼得不能再等了、預到湟源去看機會、或者隨着大帮的商隊進去、淸晨八點鐘的時候、我們雇着一輛大車離開了西寗城、朝西向湟源進發、一路全是坦道、久晴未雨塵埃很大、吾們的氣管裏、飽吸了給前面騾蹄帶上來的灰沙、這段九十里路很大、直到太陽下山一點鐘以後、兩匹疲乏的騾子纔把我們拖進一所黑暗骯髒的騾馬店中、這裏是湟源的東關、</p>
<p>翌日上午、我們在縣政府會到一位新任的朱縣長和商會會長　他們對於我要赴柴達木露着難色、因爲正在陰曆新春的時期，大帮的商人還沒發動、如果少數人去、路上的自衛和住宿飲食以及雇夫馬等等多極困難、因此我們的熱望就遭了挫折、雖然我對於蒙古民族的考察、始終不願放棄、結果經一番考慮以後、决定了到靑海東北羣科灘的計劃、</p>
<p>湟源的景象　我們在湟源正正的擔擱一天、城中空着老羊皮襖、提着幾張剛剝的羔皮、在街上逛着求售的番人、和牽了駱駝蹣跚來往的蒙人很多、此地顯然是一個商業的大市場、靑海西部蒙番的交易都集中在這裏、每年出口的羊毛羔皮藥材數量很可觀、單是羊毛一項總數在二百萬斤以上、今年天津的羊毛價錢好、所以毛市更活躍、現在當地的市價每百斤售十五元、</p>
<p>湟源就是以前的「丹噶爾」、在民國二年纔改設縣治、牠控着柴達木及玉樹等蒙番之地的咽喉、所以在地理形勢上、也非常重要、現在自湟源以西、漢回居民逐漸稀少而至絕跡、人民生活、也由農業社會而退化到遊牧社會、一般人因此稱湟源以西爲「口外」</p>
<p>城池狹長的、面積很小、東西的半里、全縣的境域很大、有四千三百多方里、但是在本省各縣中比較面積還是較小的、地勢高二六三五公尺、附郭全是平地、臨着湟水之濱、土地肥美而出莊稼、修然的白楊蔚成疎落的森林、</p>
<p>城中居民、漢回什處、東關一帶、都是回敎徒居住、城中商舖、多陝甘商人、和省城的交通、大路上汽車也能走、郵政電話也都通、全縣的學校、以男女高小爲最高學府、邊塞的重地、而敎育落後可憐、</p>
<p>館子中吃飯很貴、一盤羊肉要六毛錢、一盤鶏要八毛錢、但是你祇吃飯而不吃菜、價錢就便宜了、一盤麵片或麵條祇有五分、因爲本地人的習慣、吃飯就不常吃菜、</p>
<p>大風吹倒馬　二十二日、我們起身赴「羣科灘」縣政府派了一名警察和三區烏拉馬護送、順着大路西走、農田土舍　在白楊林中、五裏達「湟水一、我」們在此和赴「哈拉庫圖」的大道分開、路北折、漢人的荘房漸漸稀少、兩邊的山坡向着大路進逼、</p>
<p>風和日麗的大氣、也慢慢變成刮風晦暗的天氣一陣一陣的疾風、不時的夾着沙土細石向我們面部襲來、左右的樹枝都嘶嘶的吼叫、空氣中滿佈着黃色的塵土、四週的景物全糢糊了、</p>
<p>二十里、湟水從一個陡削的山峽中流出、河　結成二尺厚堅冰、我們的馬踏上溜滑的冰坂進去、迎面的風吹得更兇、兩岸石壁露着嶙峋的骨幹、此地進去就是「扎薩寺」了、我們打算到寺裏休息一下、喝杯茶、</p>
<p>忽然石壁下呼呼的發出尖聲、起了一個很大的風沙旋渦、同吾們疾掃過米、這是我們第一决的經騐、臉上被碎石子擊得很刺痛、呼吸器也閉塞不　、眼　被逼淸緊閉、這時我俯代在馬背上夾緊了雙腿、怕馬溜滑而傾跌、乖覺的牲口、牠也低頭站立不能再走了、這時我們靜待着暴風的過去、一分鐘以後、耳邊的吼聲漸漸的寂滅、風勢過了、睜眼一看、黃沙迷目、我們一只駝行李的老馬、發現被吹倒在冰上、忙的將牠抬了起來、所幸還未壓傷、仍趕着前進、很小心而輕快的穿過峽口、防着第二决暴風雨的襲來、</p>
<p>山峽的裏面、地方開曠許多、山居土舍聯成一排很小的村落、隔河南岸山均中有一叢靑翠的山林、隱着很多的房舍、那裹就是「扎藏寺」、我們跨橋過去拜訪、在一所續緻的招待室中、喝了一杯茶、吃了一片饝、寺中的堪布（方丈）又領着去參觀經堂和大顚、</p>
<p>我們想再趕三十里路、所以又忽忽的跨上馬背、沿着山麓往北進去、猛烈的風沙仍不時襲來、我伏在馬背上挾着牠前進、但是馬也是動物、牠也抵抗不住天然的暴力、所以行動很遲緩、風勢大的時候牠祇站着不動、不門半小時走上三里路、此地夾路是農民的莊子、坡勢在上升了、高度達到二八四〇公尺、風勢愈吹愈大、迎面的沙石擊得不能睜眼、臉上的積垢、像鍋底一般、我們着警察去找宿處、很幸運的一個蒙古章京（鄉長）家裏招待了去、章京名「曹格提力」、他是一位能漢語而開通的蒙人、晚上談論着一切很不寂寞、</p>
<p>初八遊牧地　一日淸早、我們離開了這偭「白楊峽「的荘　子、誠懇而富友誼的曹老爺他騎了馬親自向北遠送二十里」、是日仍沿惶水上溯、河身比惶源以下狹小三分之二、兩傍的坡田仍有蒙古人開墾、但人烟逐漸稀少了、早上的寒威凌冽、而風勢輕微、</p>
<p>二十五里以後、馬改向湟水的東岸前進、山勢漸向兩面展開、坡坨　緩許多、殘黃的衰草、遮滿了原野、顯示出大地的枯索無生氣、前程渺茫極目見不到一所土房、或一個行人、這裏也沒有正式的道路、凡馬蹄所踹踏的山坡、也都能算道路、</p>
<p>近午的天氣、風叉在刮起來了、此地距海很近、所以天天午後刮大風　一條山溝引着我們進去、重又登上一个傾斜三十五度的山坡、在此地望見前面草坪上有一羣數百隻牛羊在散牧、當我們的行列經過牠們前面時、牠們都斜着頭膽仰我們這一批親來旅客的丰采</p>
<p>裏的牛全是腹毛垂地的牦牛、羊也都是大尾巴的綿羊、時在寒冷的冬天、故牛羊身上的絨毛更蒙茸得可愛、乾枯的草都已菀落貼地、但是牠們還咀嚼得退有味、所以瞟水未見瘦損幾許、因爲牠們都是原野的主人、</p>
<p>前面二三里外有幾個黑色的帳慕、（這是我一次見到的遊牧人帳幕、）絟着的大毛狗見遠的人影已在在吠、山路繞着帳幕的後面過去、犬毛狗的吠聲、喚起了幾個黑帳中的主人出外探視、</p>

<p>糖業設施　粵省建設三年計劃及糖業設施、查粵省經濟實况、每年由國內外輸入棉及棉織品、値一萬萬元、穀米二萬萬元、油類五千萬元、各種肥料三千萬元、大宗出口貨、除食糖外、他類極少、是以粵省建設三年計劃、幾致全力於糖業之發展、現經投資五千萬元、其中四千萬元、尙未淸付於各糖廠承造商、如捷克國斯可達鐵廠、及檀香山鐵廠等、蓋付欵辦法、係訂以三年或五年爲期、按月攤付、此輩外國廠商、乃深信不疑者、實以吾粵糖業、倘予五年爲期之關稅保護、必見成功耳、而粵省當局、正竭力張羅、將所有稅收餘欵及海陸軍預備費、亦挪作糖業建設之用、倘不予以保護而遭失敗、則全省經濟立受影饗、士製糖業固隨之破產、而受迷帶關係之數百萬人民生活、亦將發生嚴重恐慌矣、允有進者、若糖稅稍减、他種實業、勢必援例要求、則資本界將中止對國內實業投資、誠恐糖稅裁減之例、引用於一切商品</p>
<p>稅率比較　各國食糖進口稅率之比較、德國每公擔徽稅七一·三二、捷克七一·一五、奧國五九·五八、匈牙利九五·二九、法國五六·一八、比國九〇·四八、荷蘭九二·二九、波蘭一五一·四六、意大利一五一·四八、羅馬尼亞三四·五九、愛斯多利亞地七·五九、英屬印度二二·三〇、中國二一·七六、比較上表所列十三國食糖進口稅率、最高者意大利及波蘭、每公擔一五一·四八元、最低爲我國、每公擔二一·七六元、意波等稅率高於我者六倍、各國平均的七二·八一元、高於我者亦達三倍之多、故無論如何、我國食糖關稅、實難裁減、</p>
<p>必須保護　與新舊式糖業相依爲命之人數、全國食糖年產的一千五百萬擔、包括粵川閩桂舊式糖寮所製之片糖在內、直接間接工作於糖業之人數、最少亦有一千萬人、查一九三零年之產額、突降至四百萬擔、其原因爲稅率低、外糖價廉、大量傾銷自一九三二年更改食糖稅率後、糖業已獲復興之機會、如將目前稅率减低、則新舊式之糖業、將見毀滅無存、我國復將被遜而購入一九三〇年時之外糖數量、由是我國存銀、以購糖之故、每年將减少最低亦有一萬二千萬元之譜、同時貿易上將更陷於不平衡之地位、故爲復興糖業前途計、爲國家經濟前途計、國產塘業、必須極力保護也、</p>

<p>体育消息</p>
<h3 id="c179">參加世運的目的和希望　：李惠堂五月五日寄自香港 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>此次吾國足球隊除參加世界還動會外、並先赴南洋爪哇等地比賽二十餘場、在世運會後、　將遊歷各國比賽、此爲吾國足球界辦體育界空前創舉、而足球允爲吾　最發達之運動、故此次出國、球隊之行踪及比賽詳情、諒爲國人所極注意　、吾國足球隊隊長李惠堂君特撰述歐遊沿途生活及比賽情形、繼續在本報發表、幸讀者注意、茲先將李君「參加世運的目的和希望」一文錄左、（編者）</p>
<p>這回足球隊參加夏令配克大會、狠多對我們愛護過深而不懂大勢的人們、都會不約而同　拘着一種雷同的奢望、希冀着我們這一班健兒、在道破題兒第　次的參加中、從羣雄逐鹿的局面裏、把世界的冠軍實、帶回到中國來、這一種事實上雖有做到的可能性、但仍非其時的希望、在現在的情形看來、是無異於叫我們去挾泰山而超北海、這並不是把自己看得太低、事實上、我們天賦的體格、生活的舒適、訓練的方法、技術的程度、和國家社會提倡的誠熱、眞沒一樣可從比較上趕得上人家、</p>
<p>還有一部份的人們、以爲我們和在中國裏居留的外人們角逐起來、已譽得非常吃力、到世界足球舞台上去更屬小巫見大巫、在國難方殷經濟困窘的今日、實不該白費一注巨量的旅費、跑去獻醜外人、這論調驟　看來似有片面的現由、但我們已自知本身的稈度幼穉、便不應自滿自足、便應該設法尋機會來把程度提高、斷不宜坐守家園、因喳廢食、老無長進、又何况我國如果不參加世運則已、若要參加、則各項運動中自以足球的技術較爲可觀、校能一新外人的眼界、因此、主張不派隊參加、似乎也近於坐井觀大的一種淺見</p>
<p>我們這回參加的目的、我曾再三的說過並沒有謀奪錦標的野心、我們祇知把全副精神貫注到「努力」方面去、把我們的眞本領和氣力一分不留地統統拿出來、目的是在給予外人對我們有一優良的印象、我們的目的也不單止到柏林去參加世運四已、世運閉慕後、我們還想跑到其他的國度　領敎人家、對人家的優點、如技術如訓　方法如陣法變幻等等、加以愼密的觀察和考究、用盡心機設法來領會人家微妙之點、以小學生求　的興奮心理去求知求進境、把自家的身份當是一塊生鐵去被人打煉越打越成器、才不負此行、</p>
<p>我們這回參加的希望、是希望能把我國數千年來的東方文化和新時代的靑年精神、表現到全世界人士耳目集中的夏令配克、會裹、一洗外人們向對華的東方病夫惡劣心理、更重要的、是在我們歸國後、把我們這一次遠行所吸收的新智識、所領略的新敎材、以身作則地陶冶到我國的足球界裏、希望把我們學來的新本事、貫注到後進者的心腦中、如果要放棄球場生活的話、也要以敎練者的身份和資格、訓導一般後進的靑年們、使我們國內的足球有大體上普及上的進展、把現在的程度提高到世界水平線上、才不負此行、</p>
<p>在首都勵　社的歡宴席上、各位院長部長和長官們我們這次殷切的期望、包含在「努力觀察」、「採長截短」、八個字裏頭、這種對我們合理的期望、使我們感覺到我們這回使命的偉大、和責任的繁重、而不敢懈惰不努力、　我本人的答詞中、我也曾說過我們體育界現在所需要的、並不在乎一二十個或一二百　優秀的好手、根木上算起來我國四百兆人口裏頭、所產生的優秀份子　實是少而又少了、以四百兆裹而挑選出來的精銳、有時還敵不過人家一營的陸軍、就是勝了其實也不覺得甚麽榮耀、這無他、近年夾我們祗　章到畸形的發展、普遍方面竟未做過實際上的功夫、父何怪其然、所以我們感到需要的是全國普遍上的淮展、把四百兆同胞都弄到體育化、都明瞭　育的基木眞義、那時候那愁中國會有外侮、</p>
<p>總而言之、我們這番出國參加世運、除了努力觀察努力表現東方文明等類的責任外、最偉大而重要的工作、是在歸國後的將來、</p>

<p>談留日學務巳上軌道</p>
<p>明日晋京謁敎王報吿</p>
<p>留日學生監督處監督陳次溥、因奉敎育部王部長令召回國、於咋日下午三時、乘上海丸抵滬、即投逆旅休憩將於十日赴京、晋謁王部長、報吿留日學生及該處處務近况、並請示今後一切進行方針、在國內約有一月之勾留、然後返任、中央社記者晤陳監督於旅邸、據談、留日學生近况及日本最近政情、茲誌如下、</p>
<p>留日學務已上軌道</p>
<p>陳氏首稱、本人於去歲八月、奉派管理留已舉務出國、至今將屆九月、此次奉部令回國述戰、在滬不多勾留、即將赴京晉謁王部長、報吿一切、本人到仟後、頓處內同人恊力苦幹硬幹、以及國內外各方之指導援助、留日學務、巳得上軌道、此堪吿慰國人者也、但積極工作、更待今後之努力、故將於此次晋謁土部長時、有所請示、俾得遵循、</p>
<p>希望日本不濫錄收</p>
<p>陳氏繼稱、本人在日時、爲使我國留日學生咸能在嚴格敎育訓　之下、充實學力、以便將來爲國家效力、故特迭次往訪日本文部省及外務省文化事業部要員、以及各大學當局、希望日本敎育當局、對於我國學生、不當濫竽錄收、在我國學生方面、固以不能求得實益、受有大虧、而在日本學校之信用、將亦蒙受極大之影響、故日本敎育當局、對於我國此種顧全留學生實學之苦心、已能體念、爰允爲恊力糾正過去之積弊、此實足以吿慰於國人者也、</p>
<p>統一介紹日已承認</p>
<p>陳氏復稱、現在監督處已統一介紹留學生入學之事　、日本各校、對於未有監督處介紹書之學生、已拒絕入學、同時監督處對於僞造證件者、不獨將證件扣留、且將其押送返國、縱有內國內學校當局以私人關係、託人取得證明文件欺朦入鑒者、一經查明後、亦須取銷其學籍、現在留日學生在監督處登記者、約達五千餘人、</p>
<p>希望學生勿圖僥倖</p>
<p>過去留舉生中、往往不諳日語、目有自已猶未到過日本、僅託僑日友人報名入學者、此種情形、當屬非是、現監督處對於留日學生、非經核對像片、幷予鄭重考核、不給介紹書、但國內一般學生、往往仍未明瞭政府對於整頓留學事業之意旨、隋便出國、致受大虧、此種流弊、大抵由於學生缺乏守法精神、以及不務實學、希各憢倖之所致、今後　生應絕對矯正此種錯誤觀念、爲自己學業及國家民族前途着想、但仍望新聞界能隨時傳達此種消息、引起各方之注意、</p>

<h3 id="c231">我的母親 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 國立曁南大學朱瑛</p>
<p>二十年前的媳婦是不好做的，母親因爲忍受不住丈夫的虐待，公婆的責駡，那時就在牢獄似的大家庭裹逃了出來，背上還帶着一個襁褓中的女孩子—我。</p>
<p>媳婦逃走，出於世代書香之家，眞是再丟臉不過的事，於是夫家自然不容，我們外祖父母，也因爲大歸不孝，不受這丟臉的女兒，祇分了一些僅够維持生命的田地房屋，母女倆，便孤苦伶仃的在冷議熱諷下生活着。</p>
<p>二十年是像吹了一陣輕輕的春風，終於飛逝了，消失了，丟臉（？）的事，在人們腦殼上的遺影，早已淡漠而至於遺忘，就是生我的爸，也聽說在前年死去了，我呢？在母親　織十指的操作，困苦的生活下，終於完成了中等敎育，走入了高等學府的大門，但是回想母親含辛茹苦，二十年如一日，眞是何等的悲傷？</p>
<p>母親常常說：「我要不是爲了你，早就死了，我爲了你，才含垢忍辱的活到現在。」我知道，我雖然已是二十多歲的人了，但是母親的苦吃够了，他老人家的皺紋深了，頭髮也白了，眞使我不敢凝視！</p>
<p>母親！我在遙遠的滬濱，祝頌你老人家的康寗和愉快！</p>
<h3 id="c232">我的母親 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 松江女子中學王東明</p>
<p>我的母親是一個很平凡的女子，似乎沒有甚麽可歌頌的地方。但是伊的偉大就在於此，因爲伊在不聲不響中盡了伊的所能，使得父親在學術上有了很大的成就，使得我們弟兄姊妹都一個個成立起來。</p>
<p>外祖父是前淸的秀才，家敎很嚴，但談吐很詼諧。母親所受外祖父的影響很大，常喜說笑話，但自有一種荘重而使人不敢接近的氣概。母親自小沒有讀書，嫁過來後漸能看看普通的書信，後來家信也會寫寫了。</p>
<p>我前面已經說過母親的偉大並不在伊本身做了甚麽大事業，伊的偉大處，正是現在摩登女子所不屑幹的處理家務上。母親出嫁時還只有二十一二歲，但因爲是父親續絃的關係，她就做了三個孩子的母親，幸虧我的哥哥們都是男孩兒的性情，落拓而和順，和母親如親生母子一般。</p>
<p>母親初來，我家卽搬往北平，在北平，我們向來是沒有親戚故舊的。在那時，父親不是終日奔忙，便是在家閉門讀書，家事全歸母親料理。母親是這樣的年靑，要照料一個有了三個孩子的家庭，眞是不容易的事情，父親受到母親的帮助，使他覺到沒有室家之累而致力於學問，這是父親日後成就的大原因。</p>
<p>民國元年時，我們的家住在日本，在那時可說是我家經濟最困難的時候。父親雖說有一些事情做，但一面又要讀書，所以總是難以應付。母親自己又添了一個孩子——我的四哥。一切事務除了由中國帶去的一個老媽子外，別無他人帮忙。而上自父下至小孩的衣服鞋襪，有一件不是母親自己做，往往深更半夜還是不息。</p>
<p>我們從日本回來後，也會在上海住過，後來父親到了北平，全家也搬了去，而父親在淸華研究院敎書時，忽然在頤和園自殺了，母親在那時悲傷得幾不欲生。可是爲了我們七個子女的緣故，終於决心忍苦來敎養我們，帶了我們回到了故鄉。</p>
<p>父親的身後大家都知道是不名一文的，幸虧大的哥哥已能獨立，母親也千千方設法使我們都受到高中以上的敎育，伊常含着眼淚微笑着看哥哥們一個個成立起來。現在我最小的第弟已讀到了高中二，而且我們弟兄姊妹都能知道讀書機會的不易，和母親的苦心，故能用功讀書，校中的成績常能使母親多得一點生趣。</p>
<p>母親現在是老了，伊巳沒有當年精明　幹的氣　。這是伊近十年來所受憂患悲傷所致。但是母親　　　　　於社會的，却是永遠不朽的。</p>
<h3 id="c233">我的母親 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 南道女師　露茜</p>
<p>外祖父是窮得可怕的。他有兩個兒子，一個女兒當兒子們長大了的時候，他也帶着女兒走出了那破碎的家，外祖母靠着大兒子在染坊裏得幾個錢過活，而叉要分出些錢留給小兒子去私塾讀書。伊每天捧上了飯碗時，便想到出走的丈夫和女兒。</p>
<p>外祖父是流落在江南；同時他的女兒，也遇到救伊的人，這便是在义埠的豪富善人，也便是我的父親。</p>
<p>父親原來的家庭，是一個複雜的家庭，也是個大族，家裏娶過妻子，所生的子女，都已很大，並且都巳嫁娶。</p>
<p>這是很可證明父親的年歲的，他要比母親大二十幾歲，當母親進門後，家庭裏除支父親，是沒有人同情伊慰安伊的，伊含忍着，爲了生活，爲了情感。在那時大家庭裏，是蓄養着大批奴婢的，他們同樣的卑視着母親，並沒有想到自己。</p>
<p>父親是早出晚歸的，在外面辦公，所以和母親在一起的時間是很少的。於是母親的悲痛，一天天的深沉，常常憂鬱的，沉默寡言，睜着眼在凝神。</p>
<p>母親就在四面楚歌中，繼續生育了哥，姊和我，伊在那時是怎樣的，期待着這些孩子的長成，以得點生之安慰呀！可是當這些孩子，還沒有明瞭生之痛苦時，仍舊是要淘氣，惹母親增加痛苦，而獨自悲泣的。</p>
<p>那時候，不但母親沒有自由，我們同樣的都沒有自由；尤其是我，得不到一個人的歡心，常常被奴婢一陣毒打，所以；我幼時，是瘦得，白得可憐的。</p>
<p>在凄風苦雨中，我們也長成了。</p>
<p>父親又娶了，住在外面也生了兩個兒子，母親格外的沉鬱　　　　　長內心，</p>
<p>在一個夏天，　夏的天，　觀飾因年老，鹽黃失敗，家事的　　；和一切生活上的侵蝕，而死亡。母親望着這三個孤兒，含着淚，漸漸瘦　下去。那時，我十二歲，姊十四，哥十六。</p>
<p>『人淸還比秋雲薄　門前庭中，都靜寂得像一個古廟。一羣舉的人，依瀾走　街前，已往人的足跡都巳湮沒。母親揑着拳，在那兒徘徊。</p>
<p>伊拿不到僅有的生活費，家中的經濟權，仍是操縱在他人的手裏，他們是小心得不會讓金錢從手指縫裏漏一點半點出來。這時沒有人能解伊，除去伊的兒女們，伊咬緊着唇，把所有的首飾，都化光。呵！伊心驚着自已是一個四十幾歲的女人，寡婦。伊仍舊要和生活環境，肉搏下去</p>
<p>伊的奮鬥，伊的掙扎，把我們領到寬大的正路上去，因此近幾年來，哥巳有了事業，姊也當了敎員，只有我繼續着在求學。</p>
<p>母親的白髮，和皺紋裏，露出了希望快樂的光。伊說：一我巳趨向老境，願你們年靑的孩子，向前邁進吧！不要脫手，不要灰心。因爲你們巳意識到黑暗，便會去追求光明；光明也會照亮了你們的一切。願你們永久記住我的話！</p>
<p>我們望着那遼遠的天，笑着流淚了。</p>
<h3 id="c234">我的母親 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 上海允中女校林彬</p>
<p>夾着雪絲的頭髮，很高的鼻子，長而方的臉龐，印着爲勞力而生出的皺紋，一個被皺紋面侵滅的酒渦，一雙有着深刻的情感和慈愛的眼睛，——這就是我的母親的輪廓。</p>
<p>沿錢塘江畔的一個省縣裏，那地方就是我母親的生地。</p>
<p>我的母親是一個五十多歲的婦人，伊在小的時候，爲着那時封建的柵欄把伊束縛着，使伊沒有識字的機會，所以伊是一個睜着眼的盲目者，伊曾奮鬥和掙扎，要求一綫的希望使　　　　　一　　字的可　。　數千年封建的　　把伊的眼睛蒙住，數千年　女人的　　把伊的手脚　住，伊不能窺視光明，伊不能解說　　而奮鬥，所能的只有在勢利的，封建的，專制的，牢　　，和遭着同樣命運的女人作無病的呻吟</p>
<p>我的母親的父親和母親，雖然是前一世紀的人，但伊們竭力想在黯淡和冷硬的環境中賜一點光明給他們的愛女，但是結果同樣地遭到了被人　指的態度，他們眼看自己的女兒爲了黑暗的封建而埋葬了求知的想望。</p>
<p>後來，我的母親結了婚，伊勤儉地治着家，伊要把新舊交替時期中的一個家庭治得非常和平，純淸，和快樂，伊烹調飯菜，伊縫做衣服，伊在暇時，要我把國事講給伊聽，有時我努着嘴不肯看報，也不肯講給伊聽，伊就用母性的手撫着我的頭說：「孩子，你得可憐你的母親，伊從小沒有贖書的機會，所以現在不識字，不能看報，不能爲國家直接效力，你以後要把你所能够做到的事來帮助人們所不能做的事，懂得嗎？孩子」！聲音裏帶着悽凉，我的眼睛，有着悔恨的淚水。</p>
<p>雖然我的母親伊自己不曾讀過書，但當我放學後，經過一定的休息時閒，伊便得催我溫書，伊説：「你努力地讀書，是在堅固地建築你自己，書裏有你自己的影子在搖晃」！我很信任母親的話，便努力地建築自己，在書裏找自己的影子</p>
<p>我帶着母親給我的心，走進這世界，——但是不久以前母親已永遠離別了我，在臨終時對我說：「孩子，你不是我專有的女兒，我把你給了人類，你是人類的女兒，你要爲人類努力，你要爲人類犧牲」！、母親很愛我，伊的愛裏沒有　矜，欺騙，虛僞，所有的是光明，溫熱，偉大，雖然母親是永遠地離開了我，但伊並沒有把伊的愛從我心底帶走！這種愛在我的身體內滿溢着，在將來需要我散放它，我要拿母親的愛去愛人類，——我是人類的女兒——因爲母親的愛是不　　被一個人佔有，這　　應　　　地散出去，　該像陽光那樣地普照，使世間不會有一價被愛　棄的人！</p>
<p>我的母親，伊就這樣地過了一生，伊現在巳去世了，但是伊的愛卻繼續地生長！——因爲任何的東西不能壓滅世界上母親們的愛！</p>
<p>在母親節，祝福母親們的康健！祝福一般有母親的人們！——因爲我是一個沒有母親的孩子！但是，沒有母親的孤兒女，我們同聲來喚一聲「母親」！</p>

<p>我和母親不相見，雖然僅只二月餘，可是我覺得二月餘的時間，對於我實在太沉長了，二月餘來，在這客遊的天涯，在這舉目無親的異鄉，一顆遊子的心，無日不在　念着年邁的母親，尤其是當這杜鵑　聲澈野的春日，　深深地　動我落漢的心，我恨不得立刻回到母親的跟前，投到伊溫柔的　裏去，受伊溫暖的手撫摩着。</p>
<p>母親占據我整個的心　，有時我雖也愛書本，可是總沒有愛母親的熱情，實在母親也是唯一愛我的人，所以我最愛的也就是母親，在課後，在銀光瀉地的月夜，我憶起母親，這圓盤似的潔白的，不就是母親圓圓的臉嗎？在花香襲人的情晨，我也想到了母親，這片片的花朶，不就是母親美麗的微笑嗎？總之，凡是一切我所愛好的，我都認爲是我母親生命的縮影。</p>
<p>春光明媚，鳥語花香，我沉在昔日的回憶裹了，這是八年前的往事了；我自校裏放夜學歸來，捉了一雙小麻雀兒玩着，一條　　緊緊他　在省　的足上，幾乎被我玩着乖死了，不留意，被母親看到了，引起了伊心絃的共嗚，起了莫大的問情，伊的眼匯突然充滿了品瑩的淚珠，「珍兒；你愛媽媽嗎？」我手牽着　索，驚異地向着母親說：「媽媽，我愛的，我最愛的是媽媽！」母親撫摩着我的頭髮說：「你願意離開你的媽媽嗎？」「不，我永遠也不要離開媽媽；媽媽，你的眼請怎麽了？」我一手牽着繩索，一手立刻拉住了母親的衣角。「珍兒！你想想看，這鳥有媽媽嗎？」我哭了；我突然投到母親的懷裏，放聲大哭了起來……</p>
<p>枝頭上雀兒們在合奏着春曲，它們在享受着天倫的樂趣，可是我卻在這客遊的天涯，在這舉月無親的異鄉，獨自沉在昔日的回憶裏，渴念着我的母親。</p>

<p>— 大夏大學　楊淑娟</p>
<p>我十一歲的那年，父親就死去了。那時候我們家裏，一個年高的祖母，三個比我更小的弟妹，頂大的姐姐也只比我大一歲，我們一點世故也不懂，只知道圍着母親，守在父親靈前流淚。當時的情况，現在想起來，還是十分悲凉的。</p>
<p>父親死了以後，我們本地的豪劣，常常藉故欺凌我們，寫甚麽捐，我們也比別人派得多，母親無法，祇得周旋奔走於這些權勢者之門，常常要看到他們不正的臉色；可是母親從不曾有半點忿怒的顏色帶回來給我們看。</p>
<p>從母親的談話中，我們知道外祖母所給予母親的完全是典型的賢妻良母的敎育；而母親自身更充分的意識到自己是社會上負責任的人，所以母親對於一切社會問題，都感覺很大的興趣。母親不主張蓄婢，伊說：「使人家骨肉分離，是最不人道的事。」</p>
<p>母親治家，寓威嚴於慈祥，母親從不高聲叱駡人，可是誰對伊都存一種敬愛的心理。因此，我們家裏不但是井然有條，而且融融洩洩。</p>
<p>父親在日，性情豪俠，常因周濟朋友，千金不吝，父親歿後，債台高築，索債者盈門，母親一面要籌償舊債，一面要支特家用，同時還要顧慮到我們的學費，使我們不致失學；而母親卻常對我們說：「我送你們讀書，並不希望你們賺錢，讀書是明理的，只要你們將來能服務社會，，做一個完整的人，我的責任就盡了。」</p>
<p>我臨出來的時侯，母親還對我說：「不識字的人是非常痛苦的。你自己求得學間以後，不要忘記這些沒有機會讀書的人。」這意思很顯明的吿訴我，不要僅僅爲自己而讀書。</p>
<p>在我們故鄉，女子能够受到敎育的很少，母親居然在那頑固的封建勢力之下，毅然送我們姊妹讀書，一直到現在，—大學。</p>
<p>出來又是兩年了，我還沒有回去看看母親，這大量的經濟負擔，不知道使我的母親增加了幾許白髮，幾許縐紋。</p>
<h3 id="c237">我的母親 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 安徽大學畢業生金瑜</p>
<p>再比像母親那樣的純潔的愛是找不到的；再比像一　孩子圍繞母親那樣的使人感到有意味也是找不到的。</p>
<p>是的，「我父親是世界上最好的父親，我母親是世界上最好的母親。」我在那裏看見過這兩句話。</p>
<p>我家是在安微省休寗縣離省十里的一個鄕村，那裏有蒼翠的山，青葱的樹，有一條不大的石橋，下面是清溪的流水。天氣晴好的時候，祇消站在村裏不遮碍視綫的地方，就可以看見百里外隱約在雲天間的黃山山峯，這是一個詩一般的環境。在洪楊以前，村裏安居樂業，不　一個世外桃源。洪楊亂後，聽說曾祖父起就以耕讀傳家，雖保持着勤儉的家風，但生活卻艱苦了。祖父是讀書人，對人對事，都是出以嚴謹的書生本色。父親就是受祖父命而養成的讀書人。</p>
<p>母親到我家來時，會祖母及祖父母們都還健在，祖父宦遊在北邊，家裏的事情，都由曾祖母管理，伊是在兩代上人卞做着賢媳婦。父親十九歲在府裏考中了秀才，沒有錢開銷來家，母親把做新娘子的「拜見禮」都給人帶與父親使用，因爲要紀念外祖們，沒有拿首飾來換。同時就在這一年添了我的大姊，次年又添了二姊，父親這時已在奉天高等學堂敎書了，一年後回到故鄕來，那是爲到美洲留學去和家人作別。當時旁人都以爲母親會出來阻撓，可是不然，母親除了把歷年自已和替姊姊們積的一些錢給父親外，　　　了父親到外洋讀書的勇氣。自此有七年之久，家裏曾祖父和祖父先後去世，母親上侍祖母，下撫大姊二姊，在並不富裕的家裏，含辛茹苦的使祖母不失歡，大姊二姊都進了學校，並且沒有　過足的。</p>
<p>父親回國，接祖母們全家到上海，母親正是三十歲，這才是母親治家的開始。此後三年裏雖然添了我和弟弟，但伊治家嚴正，派定傭工們的職務外，多由自己親自指揮處理。我們姊妹們大了，除了隨時督促我們讀書外，還要敎我們每人學習着一部分的家務，無論家境充裕與窮困，我家永遠是一個清潔而有秩序叫人看見生好感的家庭。母親雖然嚴正，但也很慈祥，對待兒女和傭工，除非有大錯，多半是慈和的，有了病痛或者我們入校離家的時候，一定要親自替我們整理行裝，伊老人家想到的和做到的總在我們之先。母親不打牌不抽烟伊的嗜好是花草。不會浪費父親血汗換來的錢，可是伊用錢以後，使伊的丈夫兒女親友們都感到舒服，貧苦的人得着實惠。那是在四年前吧，父親因公被冤，身居縲絏，幾及一年，母親把精去的首飾換了我和弟弟進大學的學費，時時諄訓我和弟弟要怎樣做一個不平凡的孩子。</p>
<p>我的母親是生長在舊　敎之下的，伊孝順　父母翁姑，伊愛丈夫和兒女，伊更能愛住何人的，現在巳是一個五十四歲的婦人，伊不會演說，不會進跳舞場，不會天天上館子，不會辦學校，…然而伊永遠是我外祖們的愛女，是我父親的賢妻，是我們姊妹　個的良母！好母親，祝福你！</p>
<h3 id="c238">我的母親 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 務本女子中學賈秋蕊</p>
<p>圓圓的面孔，胖胖的身材，寬宏大量的待人接物，這就是我的母親。伊姓雷，名呌意梅，生在甘肅涇州地方，娘家並不十分的富足，擄爸爸說：「伊十九歲的那年，就進了賈氏的門。」</p>
<p>當東方發白的時候，伊就起來煮粥，處理一切的家事，像掃地呀！洗衣呀！買菜呀！做女紅呀！伊都親手去做，雖是氣喘如牛似的勞動，但是從來沒有生，過一塲病，也從來沒有發過一句怨言？這就是伊治家的第一點特長。</p>
<p>伊第二點治家的特長，是管理兒女，不許我們染着不良的嗜好和習慣，像烟·酒·賭博之類。每天晚上，伊强迫的要我們溫習兩小時的功課。例假的日子，伊不許我們單獨的玩，由伊領了我們去玩，恐怕我們要學到頑童的習氣。</p>
<p>伊做事很是能幹，有一件事可以來體明，有一次，爸爸患了很重的赤眼，雖然用了各種眼藥水來醫治，但總是醫不好，後來伊想到一個醫限的老法子，就是用舌頭來舐，後來終於痊愈了。</p>
<p>每年到了夏季，一般苦力們，到我家裏來，向母親討取防疫解暑的藥品，（像痧藥水藥茶之類）伊總是儘量供給他們的。到了嚴冬的時候，伊印了二百張米票，買了玉十套衣服，送給一般赤貧的苦人，這種「樂善好施」的事，已經做過五年了。</p>
<p>我母親對於社會的善舉，也做了不少，除了損欵救濟外，對於一般無家可歸的孤兒，伊總是竭力的援助他們，所以住在我家附近的人，說我母親是個修福修壽的一個子孫太太。</p>
<p>上面所說的，是我母親的身世，治家，及對於社會的貢獻呀！</p>
<h3 id="c239">我的母親 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 兩江女子體育學校汪仁慧</p>
<p>我的母親是外祖母第一胎的女兒，伊是大家庭中一位小姐，因爲人多的關係，伊的母親重男輕女，是不十分愛伊的；唯有伊的祖母，是最庇護伊的，爲了專伊請了一位先生，敎伊讀書，從此依着祖母生活，伊對於功課很努力，所過的生活是快樂而幸福的；一十歲出嫁，一年後生了哥哥，繼續生了我，當我十月出世後的第二年三月，不幸父親逝世了！二十四歲的母親，就是一個　婦。</p>
<p>可憐的母親，見到了我們兄妹二人，一個三歲，一個一歲，怎不呌伊提心弔胆！伊愛我們的心是不能形容的，我記得當我八歲時，我哥哥病了，在那時我母親是何等焦急！日不安食！夜不安眠！伊並不　到疲勞，始終打起精神，殷殷的希望哥哥早一日脫離病魔　　；我慈祥的母親，是很信神的，爲了兒女，每年吃正五九月三個月的素，我們讀書，伊坐在旁邊督促，唉！伊爲了我們嘗盡了苦辛。</p>
<p>母親是極樸素的，家庭設備，極簡單清潔，是有相當藝術技巧的；對於出入賬目，完全是一個人經手，雖一文錢，都看得很重，我家現雖沒人賺錢，但是我們兄妹求學，以及家中的用費，是不會向外挪借的；我們的家庭，是很新式的，實在好玩而幸福，我們享受的一切，皆是我母親替我們經營的。</p>
<p>我家是在一個不大開化的鄕下，一切的一切，都是很閉塞，至於說到敎育方面，那更不要提了；家祖父見到這種情形，於是在鄕下辦了所小學，我母親就在校中服務，一直到現在，已有十餘年了；伊　慈善的心，普及於一般小國民，伊辦事的能力，我鄕沒有一人不稱讚，我有了這樣的一個母親，實在是世界上最幸福的人，可是我怎樣報答母親的深恩啊！</p>

<p>意軍於五月五日開入阿京，一齣現代的悲劇，至此已演到最後一幕，阿人苦戰七月，至此已總算吿一段落，完全做了意國的犧牲品，但擄五日阿京電訊，阿京全城大火，濃烟四起，暴徒成羣結隊，到處刦掠，阿京人士，急盼意軍早來，但意軍不欲負以武力佔據阿京之名，未遽開入，迨至阿京代表團親至意軍，交讓京城，意軍方始開進。此决意國明明以武力强佔了阿國，偏偏不肯居强佔的名，這樣說來，此决阿國的亡，並不是意國的强佔，到是阿國入自己不要國家，而把阿國全盤奉送給意國的，眞是我誰欺，欺天乎？亡國的慘痛，竟有這樣不可思議者。</p>
<p>當阿王離京時，阿國重要首領，如古斯太卓將軍，與加薩將軍等，坐於總督府會客室中，阿后與兒女，則留於私室，阿王出總督府時，與后並肩下階，諸兒女則隨於後，加薩將軍等，分列左右，當阿王與后經過其前時，均鞠躬至地，當時衆皆默然，形至凄楚，阿王受到這樣亡國的慘痛，阿民嘗到這樣亡國的滋味，這原是何等痛心酸鼻的時期，但當時有新聞訪員二人，因意軍遲未入京，乘間在英使署行結婚禮，新郎爲泰晤士報訪員史娣爾，新娘爲法文日報特訪員西班牙哈里羅斯女士，當行禮之際，署外匪衆槍聲，尚如聯珠而起，故有報紙稱他爲阿比西尼亞亡國時的佳話，即就該新聞記者説起來，也是佳話，他亡他們的國，我結我們的婚，原有什麽關係？但是在所在地的人民看來，是一種怎樣地印象呢？故我説世界上决不有同情心。</p>
<p>當意軍已臨阿京時，墨索里尼猶下令試騐民衆動員，在衆院中宜佈此項議决，當時座中並有外交團代表，海陸空軍高級軍官，先由齊亞諾伯爵行開幕禮，其第一言曰「阿王已逃」，於是全院歡呼，聲震屋瓦，議院乃卽休會一小時，俾作阿國戰局轉機之歡悅表示，天然，意國用武力佔據阿國之目的巳達，那有不歡悅的？前日英國內閣開會時，曾就阿王出走問題，提出研究，並將關於此事，英國政府所嘗採取之步驟，亦加以决定，惟據半官方面消息，制裁辦法，卒歸失敗，旣已證明屬實，故英國今後不擬堅持制裁政策，政界若干入士，並謂國聯會盟的，今後必須加以改革，蓋國聯的威信，業已掃地也。意阿之役，英國對於阿國，總算帮忙不少，但亦結果毫無，到此亦祗有說幾句消極閒話而已，卽使有同情心，而沒有同情力，亦只有徒喚奈何而已。</p>
<h3 id="c251">「油漆未乾」觀後 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>在意義上說，「油漆未乾」這樣的戲，較之於「少奶奶的扇子」或是「梅蘿香」之類的戲，那是有意義得多的，雖然在國難日亟的現在，在多難的血的五月的今日，它是還不够擔負起國防戲劇這個神聖的責任。</p>
<p>在「油漆未乾」中，它是嘲笑了那個貧汚的家庭的奴隸哈醫生；它也說明了一個所謂「藝術家」的作品，耍等到他死後若干年，並且是必定經過商人的手纔能提高價格，引起興趣；它更犀利地指出，有一種所謂批評家，他儘管裝模裝樣地發表他高尙的見解，其實還是始終地和商入混在一起，和他們互相利用，且看哈醫生和羅遜講價的時候，我們高尙的批評家但文波先生不是做了「公正」的估價者嗎？</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>這些，是在戲裏就讓我們能够看到的。現在我們再進一步，來看那個死後十五年才享盛名的克利斯賓是個怎樣的畫家吧？</p>
<p>「大石橋」，「舊穀倉」這一類風景畫，這些鬨動倫敦的所謂名作，其實不過是過渡時代的頽廢表現而已，這些藝術至上主義的作品，因爲恰好合上開倒車的老爺們的脾靑，再加上他生前的「螢苦格」的羅曼史，於是，整個倫敦都給鬨動了。我們高尙的批評家但文波先生要知道關妮和克利斯賓詳盡的羅曼史，他的動機，正和書畫商人的收賣他的遺作，動機是完全一樣的。</p>
<p>可惜的是「油漆未乾」中並沒有揭穿那位高尙的批評家的醜態，也沒有說明克利斯賓是一個怎樣的畫家；它祇是對那個可憐而叉可笑的家庭奴隸，—哈醫生，來一頓刻毒的嘲笑。而客觀效果上，也因爲對克利斯賓是一個怎樣的畫家沒有揭破，所以這一個藝術至上主義的晝家，也就成爲觀衆神經的一個藝術家了。</p>
<p>在演出上，導演者把那位哈醫生的動作寫得很誇張，使觀衆的注意力集中在他的身上，那辦法是很好的，不過，我以爲，單是使一個角色的動作誇張起來，那是會有使全劇不和諧的危險的，所以，用誇張的手法來處理諷刺劇，我並不反對，而可商榷的，則是應該使全劇的每個角色都給他一種誇張的手法。</p>
<p>至於其他，則旣是用誇張的手法來處理了，那麽在有許多地方，便可以配上音饗效果去，使誇張的成份更加强調起來，來帮助動作上的不够。（「欽差大臣」中假欽差喫牛排的印象到現在還留在我們腦海上的綠故，便因此。）</p>
<p>舞臺裝置和照明，本是中旅的特長，在「油漆未乾」中，照明還是處置得很好，允其是每慕中的時間分別得很好，使觀衆一望而知那是什麽時候；至於舞臺裝置，在構圖上，則沒有以前幾個的漂亮了，在墻壁上，當拿下了亞達那張値十二金鎊的畫之後，在「硬片」上應該給它留一个畫框的影子，（這在臺詞中也提到好幾决的）而現在則沒有，這很會使觀衆失去眞實的戚覺。</p>
<p>演員們的演技，最好的是「哈醫生」戴涯，其餘的人，差不多都因他顯得黯淡了。（這和特殊的把他演得誇張有關）趙慧深的戲雖演得很努力，但並沒有演得十分好，比較諧稱的倒還是吳靜的哈太太。其餘諸人都平平而已。</p>

<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>—鄉風綴拾—</p>
<p>「救命呵！你們…要…要弄死我嗎？你…你們這些黑心人不會有好日的啊！……」她儘坐在蔀里呌喊，哭駡，掙扎；但大家只裝作不曾聽見，而且更起勁的喝　着，奔—跑—跳—，澗邊，池畔，平地，險坡，許多人也像瘋在一般地忘記了疲倦，忍心的將這可憐的女人玩弄着，那面銅鑼也給敲得發了破聲響，這聲音是有點像莫阿福娘子的哭嚷聲一樣的發抖！</p>
<p>「送呆神！」大家喊過了園。</p>
<p>「送呆神！」又喊過了樟木樹塲。</p>
<p>「莫阿福娘子的呆神唬走了！」一夥年輕人使勁的拉開了喉嚨吶喊，喊得喉嚨都發了啞，喊得衣服已給汗倘濕，但是他們還要喊。</p>
<p>他們彷彿賽神會似的，很興奮。當太陽慢慢地爬過了七燈山，爬過了林屋山，高高地掛在四壟山的道人洞頭頂的時候，他們抬着莫阿福娘子，從白蛇澗，强盜山轉上去，累得她價死了似的，倒在部角落　已動也不動，只緊閉着眼晴由他們去擺佈，知覺巳經失去。</p>
<p>「把她丟在澗里了罷！」小根這樣對抬着蔀的人說。</p>
<p>「水太深，這里不行。」一個抬蔀的人說。</p>
<p>「還是綠荷池里好，那兒水淺點！」</p>
<p>穿過了麻栗樹出，從土繼橋上走過去，到了綠荷池畔。</p>
<p>「噗咚！」那女人連蔀一起到了水里，水花濺得很高，許多人的身上都給濺濕了。</p>
<p>「鳴啊！」她勉強這樣呌了一聲，在水里掙扎了幾下，便在淺水裏躺下了。於是幾個人又手忙腳亂地走下去，將她撈了起來，躺在草地上讓她吐出喝進去的水。</p>
<p>太陽照著她身上那破舊骯髒而給淤泥浸得濕淋淋的衣服，臉色是慘白得可怕，眼珠子半瞪著，呼吸是非常急迫而且細微，身子似乎有點哆嗦。人家在她臌起的肚子掀一下，她嘴裏便會咕嚕地湧出一口水來。</p>
<p>「去燒碗蘆湯來灌灌她看！」阿賓男這樣對她老婆說。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c254">開幕後 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>風刮了兩天，現在好容易停了。太陽露出笑臉，一切都像添了一分生氣。冷靜的街上，也馬上熱鬧起來。不過最熱鬧的地方，要算縣政府附近的衛生院了。—因爲今天是開幕的日子。</p>
<p>新油漆的大門，交叉着兩面嶄新的黨國旗。門旁掛着白地黑字的木牌：「××縣衛生院。」挺秀的字跡，誰看了都知道是縣長的手筆。門裏擠滿了各機關大小職員，一色的黑制服黑毡帽。也一樣地掛着一付笑臉，，似乎都在預的着主人的應酬。也許因爲找不到主人，有些眼睛便移注在幾個白衣的女看護身上。短短的黑髮，頂着塊雪白的頭巾，配上白色的長衫；夾在這羣黑傢伙裏面，顯然格外出色。可惜人太多了，長衫下的絲襪，和高跟鞋，都被擠得沒機會展覽，不過只一半也就够神氣了；在這小縣城裏。</p>
<p>擁着擠着，走過幾個屋子，看過幾個徵笑的笑臉，這便是參觀過了。最後大家都集中了禮堂，準備正式開會。</p>
<p>一陣鈴聲，一個胖子擠上講台，下面轟起一片掌聲。胖子瞇着眼看着台下，嘴一動一動，似乎在說話，可是誰也聽不見說些什麽。隨着又看見嘴努力的咧了一下，便下來了。又是一陣掌聲。</p>
<p>換了幾個演講的響過幾遍掌聲，禮成。觀衆帶了滿意的歡笑，向每一個笑臉點頭。文雅地擠出門外。屋子裏還賸下滿地瓜子皮。</p>
<p>『老李，把門外閑人轟開！像一堵墻，圍在那裹。吿訴他們，這不是出殯！』胖子把來賓送走，剛回到門裏便這樣喊。</p>
<p>『是。』老李正在忙着掃地上的瓜子皮，紙烟頭什麽的，聽了丟下掃帚跑出去。胖子跨進另一個屋子。</p>
<p>「護士室。」門旁掛着油漆未乾的木牌。</p>
<p>『怎麽樣？滿意罷？密斯張。』胖子又恢復了笑臉。</p>
<p>『要命！都像些猪玀』密斯張正脫掉脚上高跟鞋。</p>
<p>『這是到「鄉村」來呀。』胖子笑了一聲，又接着說『蠢當然是了，不過也有好處：容易對付。』胖子貼近了密斯張。後幾個字，說得特別低。回答是一陣吃吃艷笑。</p>

<p>「桃源春夢」的攝製期內，適值新華公司大擴充，因此在各項技術人材方面，越發的充實有力，佈景是出於張雲喬織巧心理所設計，有桃花源一景，把十二畝的新華新攝影場的地面搭得密不通風，全部山景，有三層樓洋房的高度，所以在徐家匯三角地遠望過去，已經可以很清楚地看到山峯，有人奇怪，怎么在上海發現了山峯，走近一里路一看，原來是新華公司新攝影塲裏的大佈景，這堂佈景在片子還未公映的現在，徐家匯一帶已經是很轟動了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Japanese military officer Imai came to Tianjin at noon on the 8th. At 9 pm, a meeting was held at Zhang Yuan's residence to discuss the issue of the Jidong government's cancellation of troops. The basis of the discussion was the result of Tada's meeting with Yin. Nagami, Imai, Nakai and other military staff participated in the discussion. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Assistant Officer Matsumuro and Hamada talked, the Hebei-Chahar issue has not been negotiated specifically, nor is there any complicated or tense fact. The Japanese side does not hope that North China will secede from the Nanjing government, but only hopes that the Hebei-Chahar authorities will: 1. Work hard to prevent communism; 2.

Small European countries such as Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands are preparing to withdraw from the League of Nations one after another and form a Nordic group. This move not only weakens the application of the League of Nations' final structure, but also weakens British political control in Northern Europe. The second is the convening of the permanent political conference of the Balkan Entente countries, such as Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia, to negotiate on issues such as the military mutual obligations of each country, the re-establishment of defenses in the straits, a common diplomatic front, the Italian invasion of Albania, and the Rhine River and the German-Austrian merger, the Hungarian-Polish rapprochement, and Hungary's formal expansion of its military.</p>
<p>These two major changes are interrelated. In a nutshell, the post-war European balance of power has reached its final stage of shaking. The League of Nations is not to be relied upon, and the powerful countries of Britain and France are not enough to guarantee peace in Europe. Like a candle in the wind, self-reliance is not enough to survive, and collective strength is not enough to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, this kind of objective situation has created a regional security system.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the Nordic issue and focus on the Balkan issue. Its position is indeed worrying. Since the German army entered the Rhineland, the German Nazi Party's policy has been to vigorously develop from Austria to the Balkan countries in order to extend its influence in the Mediterranean. The long-silent issue of the German-Austrian merger has recently become tense again, and there are rumors that it will be realized soon. At the same time, Hungary and Austria have also formally requested to expand their military equipment and restore conscription. The secret military alliance between Germany and Bulgaria has also become increasingly open. This not only makes the Entente and the Balkan countries feel a serious threat, but also makes Bulgaria more assertive about the three demands made when the Balkan countries established a public organization in January 1934 (1. Guarantee the freedom of education, religion and language of the Bulgarian people in the Balkan countries. 2. Equality of armaments. 3. Access to land leading to the Aegean Sea). Thus, the Balkan Entente countries have developed a common interest.</p>
<p>On the Italian side, the victory of the military invasion of Albania will inevitably strengthen its determination to break the status quo. In the future, its policy towards the Balkan and Central European countries will inevitably move towards monopolization. Italian aggressors have always expressed dissatisfaction with the Balkan unity movement. They believe that only the power of ancient Rome can bring lasting peace to the Balkan Peninsula. They not only demand political control of the Dalmatian coast and complete control of Albania, but also yearn for Corfu (Capfce) in Greece. Therefore, Turkey, which is connected to Greece, has also weakened its defenses in the Mediterranean and has had to propose restoring the fortifications of the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>The Balkan Entente countries after the war have always turned to the League of Nations and relied on France. Since the French-Italian Rome Agreement in January last year, France has in fact lost its leadership. The position of the Balkans is under siege by Italy, Germany, Britain and France, and the complexity of the situation is no less than that of the Rhineland issue and the Austrian issue. The convening of this conference is undoubtedly to resolve this difficult situation and seek close unity among the four countries.</p>
<p>Now the political conference of the Balkan Entente countries has come to an end, and the adjustment of the European situation is actively progressing. The Balkan issue will become more and more complicated in the future.</p>

<p>He was received by Chairman Lin of the National Government and Foreign Minister Zhang Qun at 11:00 yesterday morning, and a banquet was held at the Foreign Ministry Building in the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Ma Yinchu Speaks on the Economy in Extraordinary Times <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>We must try to avoid unlimited inflation of currency.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Lizi Society hired Ma Yinchu on the 8th to speak on the economic problems in extraordinary times. More than 2,000 people listened. The main points of the speech are as follows: The economic principles in extraordinary times are different from those in peacetime. For example, in peacetime, free competition is the principle. The cinemas in Nanjing are thriving, and new ones are being built one after another, competing with each other, so there is today's progress. In times of war, social funds need to be concentrated on the war. They should no longer be used to build theaters. Therefore, the government should come out and interfere and stop the role of free competition. This is one of the differences between wartime economy and peacetime economy. First, since the government comes out to interfere, it must be controlled. Some people advocate using the control methods used by Europe and the United States during the European War in China. This is a big mistake, because it is easy to control large industrial countries, but it is difficult to control agricultural countries. The production of large industrial countries is mostly concentrated in the hands of hundreds of trust companies. These large companies can manufacture ordinary goods in peacetime. Once in wartime, the sales of ordinary goods will decrease sharply, and it is necessary to transform military supplies. The government is a big customer of military supplies. Therefore, factories must be controlled by the government. Moreover, the duration of the war cannot be predicted. If the war stops in a short period of time, who will sell the large amount of military supplies produced? Therefore, private companies often do not specialize in large-scale cattle production without the government's guarantee of compensation for losses. Therefore, they are willing to be controlled by the government. This is why it is easy. As for agricultural countries, rice, wheat and cotton are military supplies and ordinary goods. They do not necessarily have to be sold to the government. Even if they cannot be sold this year, they can wait until next year. They do not have to rely on the government's purchase. Therefore, they do not have to be controlled by the government. Moreover, the number of farmers is large. Almost every farmer becomes a unit. The more units there are, the more difficult it is to control. It is not as easy as controlling hundreds of large companies in large industrial countries. However, it is also necessary to control it, because once a war breaks out, everything will not be able to meet the demand for water, and the price will rise. In addition, various production costs, such as transportation costs, insurance costs, interest, and taxes, are higher than in peacetime. Of course, prices will rise. At this time, there must be a practical and feasible control method, that is, to increase production on the one hand, and men, women, old and young should all do their part. On the other hand, the savings must be controlled. The automatic savings of the people are equal to not saving. There are many ways to control it. The most suitable method in China is persuasion. For example, the silk and cotton clothes obtained by the 19th Route Army during the January 28 Incident were all obtained through persuasion. Tax increases, such as tin, can be used for military supplies. At this time, it should not be used to make tin foil. The method of increasing taxes is used to control it. Quantitative distribution, such as gasoline, is a commodity that our country is very short of. At this time, the people should try their best to save money. Each person should not use more than a certain number of gallons per week. We must know that the most terrible thing in wartime is rising prices. Poor people have difficulty living and cannot avoid taking risks, which affects the war in the front. Moreover, on the other hand, rising prices create a class of nouveau riche, which makes the general public feel more unfair and internal conflicts are likely to occur. We must find ways to avoid them in advance. In addition to increasing production and saving consumption, we must also try to avoid unlimited inflation of currency so that prices do not rise. This is why I do not advocate the policy of paper money. As for tax increases, they can also be adopted, but indirect taxes are easy to transfer and still fall on the poor, and prices will rise. They should not be adopted. Direct taxes, such as income tax, etc., are not easy to transfer and are borne by the rich. They do not affect prices. Once the foundation of income tax is established, a windfall profit tax can be levied during wartime to satisfy the general public. If this is done, the poor will contribute manpower and the rich will contribute financial resources. The burden will be shared equally, and things may be successful. Otherwise, I am afraid that it will cause a great misfortune to society. How can we not be afraid? (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>Dongzhuang Shenbao Jian, Li Shengtun News, Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju, accompanied by provincial government officials, took four large cars from Yuncheng at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th to Dongzhuang to inspect the closure project. Kong Xiangrong, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, was unable to spare time to stay in Bian to prepare for flood prevention in Hebei and Henan. He specially sent Director Xu Hongkui and Chief Engineer Wu Nankai to entertain him on his behalf. Han praised the closure dam for its solid construction and expressed his deep gratitude to the welcoming staff on behalf of the people of Shandong Province. He also said that he was the first to agree to Kong's plan that day, and he was very pleased that it was successful. He also visited the Dawang Temple. Xu Wu and others entertained him. After dinner at the office, he left Dong at about 6:00 p.m. and rushed to Heze to inspect. Ran Jiwu, director of the purchasing department of the military and civilian political closure project, accompanied him to provide all the hospitality.

<h3 id="e26">Construction of Sichuan Provincial Highway <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The intermodal transportation between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces has been signed, and Hu Jiazhao will also serve as the Director of the Guizhou Construction Department.</p>
<p>(Chengdu) The intermodal transportation of passengers and goods on the highways of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces has been negotiated since Shen Mingda, Director of the Guizhou Road Bureau, came to the province to contact Wei Junfan, Director of the Sichuan Road Bureau. The intermodal transportation agreement has been signed and is ready to be implemented on July 1st. There are 29 articles in total. The construction of the Sichuan-Kangding Highway will start on the 15th and will be completed in three months. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek previously allocated 5 million yuan in construction funds for rehabilitation public bonds, which have been cashed out for 3 million yuan by the Road Supervision Office of the General Headquarters and transferred for distribution. The Sichuan-Yunnan Highway was originally planned to run from Ya'an through Xichang and Huili to Kunming, in order to develop the rich resources of Dianbo and Mabian counties. However, due to the huge project, it was changed to run from Longchang through Luxian, Xuyong, Chishui, Bijie, and Dawining. Construction will start when the Sichuan-Kangding Road project personnel can be transferred. Hu Jiazhao, Director of the Highway Supervision Office, is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 9th to report the latest road construction situation to Gu Zhutong. According to reliable sources here, Hu will also serve as the Director of the Guizhou Construction Department and the Director of the Guizhou Highway Bureau. It is said that the vacancy of the Director of the Fujian Construction Department will be announced soon. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>Amended Table of the National Assembly Election Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 60th meeting on the morning of the 8th. Sixty-seven members, including Wang Kunlun, attended. Sun Ke chaired the meeting and Liang Hancao served as secretary-general. The items discussed were: (1) The total budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure of Anhui Province in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, with revenue and expenditure each listed at 11,152,644 yuan. (2) The total budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure of Peiping City in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, with revenue and expenditure each at 5,886,964 yuan. (3) The total budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure of Qingdao City in the 24th year of the Republic of China, with revenue and expenditure each listed at 6,475,879 yuan. It was resolved that the above three cases should be passed in accordance with the results of the Financial Committee's review. However, the budgets of all provinces and cities in the future should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review before the beginning of the year in accordance with the budget regulations. Before the three cases were discussed, Lin Bin stood up to report on the second table of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, saying that the division of the electoral districts in Shanxi and Sichuan provinces would still follow the original plan. The original ten districts in Yunnan Province have been changed to eleven districts, and each district should produce two representatives. Districts 1 and 3 in Hebei Province are switched, Districts 1 and 2 in Qinghai Province are switched, and Districts 1 and 8 in Guangxi Province are switched. The number of representatives is also switched. The reason for switching the electoral districts in Hebei, Qinghai and Guangxi provinces is that the provincial capitals have been relocated, so the electoral district to which the provincial capital belongs must be ranked first. After Lin's report, it was passed according to Lin's plan. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>Executive Yuan Meeting Will Postpone Discussion of Sanctions Issue</p>
<p>(Geneva) The fate of the League of Nations, the result of so-called neutral countries determined to seek their own safety, is now at a crossroads. According to today's announcement, these countries will hold an important meeting on Saturday to consider the attitude taken by the Danish representative at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on Monday to discuss the Italian-Albanian dispute. The foreign ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands have all expressed their willingness to participate in the meeting. Spain and Switzerland will also be invited to attend. Many believe that if the League of Nations tends to make a compromise with Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway may all withdraw from the League of Nations. At the same time, Paris is expected that the Administrative Council meeting on Monday will again shelve the sanctions against Italy, because the French government has decided to urge the meeting to postpone the discussion of serious matters until the new French government is established. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Financiers here familiar with the situation believe that if Italy does not entrust the rich resources of Albania to financial groups of other countries, Italy will not be able to develop Albania economically. Italy's conquest of Albania must be premised on economic development. Therefore, Britain, the League of Nations and even France will not be willing to recognize Albania as a territory of Italy. It is learned here that Soviet Russia has decided not to recognize it. The United States, based on its consistent policy, probably will not recognize land acquired by force. As for the Balkan Entente countries and the Little Entente countries, it is understood that they will not take any action until Britain and France have recognized it. In addition, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands will probably make a decision on Saturday not to recognize it. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet on the 11th of this month. According to people close to the League of Nations, the issue of sanctions against Italy will not be submitted for discussion at that time. The reason is that this issue was passed by the Sanctions Program Adjustment Committee composed of 52 member states. However, the committee has the right to revoke it, and the Administrative Council may not make a decision on its own. However, it is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will announce the annexation of Abyssinia tomorrow. Most member states are deeply unhappy with this move. Therefore, it is not known whether the sanctions issue will be raised again for discussion. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Italian representative will make a request at the Administrative Council meeting not to allow the Abyssinian representative to attend the meeting. People from the Italian side here recently denied this statement. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that although Italy has completely controlled Abyssinia, Britain will advocate continuing sanctions against the aggressor when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets next week. At that time, Foreign Minister Eden's authority will be expanded to allow him to decide the path that Britain will follow. However, Eden's request for sanctions must be based on the agreement of other countries before it can be decided. Several countries that are currently implementing sanctions intend to wait and see and advocate writing off all sanctions. Reliable sources claim that Eden will first contact Soviet Russia, France, the Little Entente and other countries in order to negotiate a revision of the League of Nations Covenant. It is also reported that the Foreign Office is now considering permanently withdrawing the embassy in Abyssinia when Prime Minister Mussolini annexes Abyssinia into Italian territory.

<p>The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party Will Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Tonight</p>
<p>(Rome) It is expected that Mussolini will announce the annexation of Abyssinia to 300,000 people at the Palazzo Venezia on Saturday. All Fascist organs have been ordered to arrive at the venue around 11:00 p.m. tomorrow to listen to Mussolini informing the cabinet of the news. The Fascist Supreme Council has scheduled an extraordinary meeting for 10:00 p.m. tomorrow to approve the proposal to annex Abyssinia, because only this council can consider issues related to Italy's borders. The annexation of Abyssinia must be approved before the cabinet can draft the proposal into an order. Mussolini will announce the annexation news immediately after the meeting. Today, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published an article by Gayda, saying that the only result of the Abyssinian land issue is to annex the land, which is indeed simple and clean for Italy. This move is in line with the rights of Italian victors and the rights of the people to enjoy peace, order and protection. The people have asked for this, and the Fascist government has granted it. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party recently decided to meet at the Palazzo Venezia at 10:00 p.m. on the 9th of this month. There will be an important resolution at that time. After the meeting, Prime Minister Mussolini will stand on the balcony and announce it. According to rumors from outside, the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party intends to declare the Kingdom of Italy an empire and bestow the title of Emperor of Abyssinia on Italian King Victor Emmanuel III.

<p>The Mayor Welcomes Him with Great Ceremony, British Warships Salute</p>
<p>His Majesty, the King of Al, along with members of the royal family and entourage, arrived here today at 11:30 AM aboard the British warship "Adventure I" at Haifa Port in Palestine. The Governor of Palestine and the Mayor of the city welcomed them at the pier, with a squad of guards presenting arms in salute. After disembarking, the King and his party immediately proceeded by special train to Jerusalem. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>The King of Haifa fled the capital on May 3rd. Subsequently, accompanied by his queen, children, and others, they arrived here aboard the British cruiser "Adventure," reaching the port today. The Mayor of Haifa and others welcomed him with great ceremony. The Queen was assisted down the ship's ladder by the Al court physician. As the "Adventure" approached the pier, British warships in the harbor fired salutes in respect. The Italian mail ship "Canano" was also docked in the harbor, displaying flags and bunting to celebrate the Italian army's victory in East Africa. Subsequently, a hundred steel boxes and one small green currency chest, guarded by Al soldiers, were unloaded from the "Adventure," presumably containing the King's treasures. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>The Emperor of Al, accompanied by his family and retinue, traveled from Djibouti, French Somaliland in East Africa, aboard the British cruiser "Adventure," via Haifa Port in British Mandate Palestine, en route to Jerusalem. The ship passed through this port at 4 PM today, taking only thirteen minutes from entrance to exit. Previously, the wife of Prince Pisto of Italy (the Princess had been working as a nurse in the army hospital in Massawa, East Africa, and is now returning home due to the end of the war) sailed through on the Italian hospital ship "Caesar." Italian residents waved their national flags to bid her farewell at the pier. The "Adventure" passed through only a few hours later. The Italian flags were still flying, and the bustling crowd of Italian expatriates seemed to flaunt Italy's victory. Looking back at his great kingdom, no longer his own, and remembering his former power, now gone, the Emperor couldn't help but feel distressed and frown. Apart from the Italian expatriates, the rest of the crowd on the pier showed sympathy for the Emperor, remaining silent as if unable to suppress their sighs. As the "Adventure" entered the port, it was escorted by fourteen local police patrol boats. Police officers lined the pier, and all exits were blocked, preventing unauthorized entry. Three British warships and the French cruiser "Latouche-Tréville" were docked in the harbor, all firing salutes to the "Adventure." The Emperor returned the salute from under a canvas awning on the stern. The "Adventure" had originally intended to dock briefly at this port so that the Al currency carried by the Emperor could be exchanged for British pounds, but at the last minute, the captain received orders from the Admiralty not to stop, and the ship continued on its way.

<p>Portuguese Representative Departs for Geneva</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow to confer with French authorities on the international situation, and then travel by train from Paris to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Foreign Office sources, it is speculated that the League of Nations Council meeting, scheduled to begin next Monday, May 11th, will likely postpone a decision on the sanctions issue, pending the formation of a new French cabinet. Foreign Secretary Eden will discuss this matter with French Foreign Minister Flandin when passing through Paris at the end of this week, to harmonize the views of Britain and France. Foreign Minister Flandin will certainly consider the diplomatic program of the French left-wing Popular Front. The leaders of that faction will also meet with Eden, as the future French cabinet will be formed by the left-wing Popular Front, which strongly supports the League of Nations' policies. Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox French Socialist Party and the future Prime Minister, has sent Socialist MP Vienot to London. Vienot, a staunch supporter of the League of Nations Covenant, will meet with Foreign Office advisor Strang, and it is possible that he will also call on Foreign Secretary Eden. In addition, Major Attlee, the leader of the British Labour Party opposition, is also scheduled to travel to Paris at the end of this week to hold talks with leaders of the French Socialist Party. The British Labour Party's attitude towards the sanctions issue will be determined as a result of Attlee's trip. Political figures here say that these semi-official talks between figures in and out of power in Britain and France will have an important impact on the League of Nations' policy towards Italy.

<p>Strong Support for Amending the Covenant</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords met today to discuss the reorganization of the League of Nations. Liberal Party member Lord Lothian delivered a speech, stating, "In my view, it is not the concept of the League of Nations that has failed, but rather the principles enshrined in Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant. These principles state that whenever there is an attempt to forcibly change the existing system anywhere, the member states of the League of Nations have an obligation to suppress it. This obligation is universal and automatic in nature, and it cannot be avoided. To be truly effective, it must involve war. This has been clearly demonstrated by recent experience. We are neither able nor willing to fulfill such an unlimited obligation. If we can state as soon as possible our determination not to fulfill this kind of obligation, we can quickly break free from the current situation and restore the past, allowing all issues concerning true world peace to be dealt with through diplomatic channels." Lord Lothian then cited several letters from American figures published in British newspapers to support his argument. The letters stated that if Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant could be abandoned, then the United States' view of the League of Nations could change significantly. Labour Party leader Lord Ponsonby then, in his personal capacity, asked the government whether it was prepared to submit to the League of Nations a proposal for reforming the collective security mechanism, and stated that he advocated adding the following provision to Article 18 of the Covenant: "The League of Nations should organize a special body to review all treaties registered by the Secretariat every two years, to determine whether they should be confirmed, amended, or suspended."</p>
<p>Note: Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant states: "The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled."</p>
<p>Article 16 states: "Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting therefrom, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League. Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon."</p>
<p>Article 18 states: "Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered." (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee recently met here to study in detail Britain's attitude towards the sanctions issue. After the meeting, a leader of the party told reporters that "the League of Nations' handling of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute has failed. Britain has nothing to be ashamed of, and the British government's policies have not lost the confidence of the public." He also said, "We believe that the issue of lifting sanctions must be approached with caution, and that the League of Nations must be reorganized if its actions are to be truly effective in the future. As for France, it must fully participate in any collective action, both now and in the future." According to Conservative Party sources, the majority party believes that lifting sanctions against Italy should be linked to amending the League of Nations Covenant. Sir Austen Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons yesterday fully represents the views of this group. However, the current sanctions should be maintained until the new order in Abyssinia is established and a decision is made on amending the League of Nations Covenant. As for the amendment of the Covenant, the British government will seek the views of the Dominions, and it will be difficult to make proposals in the short term. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e35">League of Nations Budget in Surplus <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to a communiqué issued by the League of Nations Secretariat, although the League of Nations is facing a political crisis, its financial situation is very good. The League of Nations' budget for this year is 28,279,000 Swiss francs (hereinafter abbreviated as such). As of April 30th, only 11,433,073 francs had been spent, of which the actual expenditure was only 8,30,245 francs, leaving a surplus of 3,129,828 francs, which is deposited in the bank. The arrears in membership fees from member states have decreased from 11.63% last year to 5.64%. In view of the surplus in this year's budget, the League of Nations Budget Supervisory Committee is considering three options: Reduce the membership fees of small countries; The surplus will be used as a public reserve fund; All remaining funds will be allocated to the Intelligence Division for publicity expenses, so that all countries have a deeper understanding of the League of Nations' activities. Which of the above three options will be adopted has not yet been decided. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Al Capital In order to enforce the law and maintain order, martial law has been declared and a military tribunal has been established to deal exclusively with cases of violence. This step is considered a necessary path to maintain security and restore normalcy. General Badoglio has set up his headquarters in the Italian Embassy. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Al Capital General Badoglio today appointed General Graziani as the commander of the Al Capital Garrison.

<p>(Rome) News from the Al Capital says that the situation there is now as peaceful as ever. All administrative organs have been taken over by the Italian army and have begun to work, and are proceeding smoothly. General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian East Africa High Command and the Expeditionary Force, has decided that the area along the railway line from the Al Capital to Djibouti, French Somaliland, should be garrisoned by Italian troops to protect traffic.

<p>Djibouti It is reported that the Italian army and the French-Al Railway Company have had a serious dispute over the transportation of troops and war supplies, because according to the 1908 Djibouti-Al Capital Railway contract, troops and war supplies may not be transported. The company has consistently prohibited the transport of Al military supplies by this route. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Al Capital Italian Army Commander General Badoglio today ordered the people of Al to hand over their weapons by midnight tonight, otherwise they will be executed. Al people who fled to the mountains before the Italian army occupied the Al Capital are now returning one after another. There is a shortage of food in the city, and food prices have soared as a result. Both Italian and Al sides are filled with panic. However, the city has gradually returned to normal after several days of riots. It is estimated today that 750 people died violently in the chaos in the capital in the past few days. Relatives are often seen searching for corpses on the streets, and unclaimed bodies are buried by the Italian army. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

After heavy rains, the roads became swamps, making it very difficult for mechanized columns to advance. Later, engineers built a bridge over the Jerer River between Gorahei and Dagah Bur, and the army was able to continue its advance. Italian troops entered Jijiga on the afternoon of May 5th, the same day that Italian troops on the Northern Route occupied the Al Capital. Italian troops are protecting many war supplies.

<h3 id="e41">The British Government's Memorandum in Response to Hitler's Proposal is Published - The List of Questions Contains Eleven Points, Requiring Supplementary Explanations in Polite Terms <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government's list of questions regarding the German memorandum of March 31st was published today in the form of a White Paper. In addition to the preface, it contains eleven key points in polite terms. On the one hand, it expresses satisfaction with certain points in the memorandum and the declarations issued by the German authorities, and on the other hand, it requests supplementary explanations or revisions to other points. Here is an excerpt from the original text:</p>
<p>Preface The British government sincerely hopes that all European countries can establish a truly lasting peace based on mutual recognition of independent rights and equal rights, and mutual respect for their accepted obligations. However, it is regrettable that the German government has failed to make a substantial contribution to restoring credibility as a major condition for extensive negotiations between Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>Main Text of the List of Questions The German government is currently willing to conclude honest treaties with the countries concerned.</p>
<p>The British government cannot agree with the German argument that the Treaty of Versailles and the various treaties arising from it should be abolished.</p>
<p>According to item 4 of the German memorandum, "There is a clear distinction between the German government and the German nation." The real question is whether the current Germany believes that the territorial status quo in European politics has reached a point where it can be recognized and respected. If there are those who are dissatisfied, can they conduct free negotiations with the countries concerned in the hope of reaching an agreement to correct them (i.e., not to correct them directly).</p>
<p>When German leader Hitler delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on May 21st last year, he proposed concluding a Western European aerial pact, but did not advocate the establishment of a regional air force limitation agreement to supplement the aerial pact, which the British government regrets.</p>
<p>The German government is willing to negotiate a 25-year mutual non-aggression pact with France and Belgium, with Britain and Italy as guarantor countries. The manner in which this pact should be formulated must be determined after negotiations have taken place. The British government has taken note of all of this.</p>
<p>The German government is prepared to negotiate mutual non-aggression pacts with neighboring countries in the Southeast and Northeast. The British government has also taken note of this and expresses satisfaction. However, the British government also wants to know whether these pacts can be supplemented by mutual assistance agreements.</p>
<p>"Since the German government has declared its eagerness to rejoin the League of Nations, the British government therefore believes that the bilateral mutual non-aggression pacts proposed by Germany can be integrated with the collective security obligations undertaken by member states of the League of Nations, and believes that these pacts can be used within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant without any difficulties."</p>
<p>It is good that the German government is willing to negotiate mutual non-aggression pacts with neighboring countries in the Southeast and Northeast. The British government firmly believes that if the so-called "neighboring countries in the Southeast and Northeast" can include the Soviet Union, Latvia, and Estonia in addition to the directly neighboring countries, the solution to various European problems will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>German leader Hitler said in a speech in the House of Representatives on May 21st last year that "Germany is always ready to sign international pacts to prevent interference in the internal affairs of other countries." The British government is now happy to reiterate this.</p>
<p>What about the international arbitration tribunal proposed by Germany? The British government hereby requests clarification and states that there is already a permanent international tribunal in The Hague.</p>
<p>Regarding the separation of the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles, what is the content? The British government sincerely hopes that the German government will provide additional explanations. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It was learned here today that the list of questions submitted by British Ambassador to Germany Phipps to German Foreign Minister Neurath is intended to probe the true intentions of German leader Hitler on general issues. The list does not mention the colonial issue at all, because Britain is currently unwilling to discuss the restoration of Germany's lost territories, and hopes that Germany will be able to abide by international obligations in the future, respect the independence of Austria, and the legal status of Memel and Danzig Free City.

<p>(London) News Chronicle reporter David Kischill recently declared that Conservative Party extremists have recently been plotting a cabinet ouster movement, attempting to support current Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain to form a purely Conservative cabinet to replace the current cabinet. The main figures they intend to recruit into the cabinet include current Lord Chief Justice Lord Hewart, former Foreign Secretary Hoare, and Hall. Current Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden are excluded. This is at a time when Prime Minister Baldwin is about to woo Hoare back into the cabinet as a contingency plan.

<p>Sent to President Roosevelt for Signature</p>
<p>(Washington) The Army Department's proposed budget, totaling $572,446,844, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14th, and was passed by the Senate today. The funds are allocated to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal and Honolulu, expand the Air Force (i.e., add 565 aircraft), and increase the Army's manpower (to 165,000 personnel). The bill has now been sent to the White House for President Roosevelt's signature to become law. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the Army budget, which provides for increasing the Army to 165,000 men. It then began discussing the $52.9 million Navy budget. Senator Nye argued against the US and Japan engaging in a naval race, but said that the two countries were already engaged in an unconscious competition. He stated that even if the Japanese navy were twenty times larger than the American navy, it could not advance to within 100 miles of the American coast, and vice versa. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Neely today denounced the expansion of armaments during the debate, calling it a trigger for war, and strongly criticized the construction of two new battleships. He said that every time Congress proposes military spending, there is talk of war between the US and Japan. However, if the US did not give Japanese militarists an excuse to demand the expansion of armaments by arming itself every year, the arrogance of the Japanese militarists would have long been extinguished. The bill provides for a standing army of 150,000 men and an additional 5,000 National Guardsmen, totaling 200,000 men. It also allocates $45,000,000 to purchase 565 aircraft. (Japanese Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Appropriations Committee today passed an additional relief appropriations bill of $2,364,229,712, of which $1,425,000,000 is for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) program.

<h3 id="e46">Japanese House of Representatives Budget Debate: Military Spending Expansion Under Heavy Attack <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Social Masses Party Leader Hisashi Aso Scathingly Criticizes the Military for Disregarding the People's Livelihoods</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Diet session on the 7th, Saito Takao of the Minseito Party questioned the military and the issue of constitutional politics, sparking a heated debate that made the atmosphere in the chamber tense. On the 8th, because the House of Peers was not holding a formal meeting, the center of political debate shifted to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives convened its first general meeting on the budget at 9:00 AM and began the questioning. Ti, Wakamiya, Taketomi, and others successively expressed their opinions, discussing issues such as reforming the tax system, revitalizing finances, establishing local finances, and expanding industry and trade, pressing the government and scrutinizing its policies. The plenary session convened at 1:00 PM. In addition to speeches by Iwasaki, Muramatsu, and Miyoshi, Hisashi Aso, the leader of the Social Masses Party, which won 18 seats in the recent election and is the only opposition party, appeared on the stage for the first time to thoroughly criticize the current government's policies. He questioned the government's beliefs on issues such as finance, the economy, diplomacy, and military reduction. Therefore, today's meeting is sure to have a heated debate.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened at 1:34 PM and continued with the questioning. First, Iwasaki Koji of the Seiyukai Party demanded that the authorities reflect on issues such as the abuses in the application of the constitution, the reform of the emergency situation, the irrational crackdowns by the police, and other violations of human rights. Prime Minister Hirota, Army Minister Terauchi, Interior Minister Shio, and Justice Minister Hayashi each gave simple answers. Regarding the issue of stabilizing the people's livelihood, Muramatsu Hisayoshi and Nagai Ryutaro of the "Minseito" Party questioned the Finance and Army Ministers. Furthermore, regarding the land tenant issue, they questioned the authorities. The Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Commerce Minister, Agriculture Minister, and Navy Minister each took the stand to answer. Subsequently, at 4:08 PM, Miyoshi Nobufusa of the Seiyukai Party questioned issues such as rural problems, debt consolidation, balanced burdens, and local financial allocations. The Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Interior Minister, Colonial Minister, Army Minister, and others each gave simple answers. Then, Hisashi Aso of the Shakai Taishuto Party delivered his maiden speech, attacking the Army Minister regarding the issue of stabilizing the people's livelihood and the military's sole focus on expanding the budget without regard for the people's safety. Regarding the diplomatic issue, he briefly stated:</p>
<p>The current Sino-Japanese relationship is truly very serious. However, the closest period of Sino-Japanese relations was rooted in the ideas of the Chinese Revolution. At that time, Chinese and Japanese revolutionaries were closely united. Later, with the development of the capitalism of the great powers, rifts appeared in Sino-Japanese relations, and there is no so-called guiding principle to this day.</p>
<p>He then advocated for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations and constructing "Manchukuo," establishing a kingdom based on benevolent rule without exploitation, and establishing an ideal guiding principle.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied as follows:</p>
<p>Even during the Chinese Revolution, Sino-Japanese relations cannot be considered friendly. We should strive to adjust them in the future. The adjustment of relations with the Soviet Union also goes without saying, but we hope that the ideas of our people will develop in a healthy way, and we should strive for that.</p>
<p>At this point, Akira Kazami of the "Kokumin Domei" Party raised several questions, as follows:</p>
<p>Will a general tax be levied on the masses? If you tout economic diplomacy, it will be detrimental to the 400 million people of China. Are there any countermeasures for the agricultural panic in China?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Baba replied as follows:</p>
<p>I will not levy a general tax on the masses that threatens the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied as follows:</p>
<p>One way to help Chinese farmers is to export cheap Japanese goods to them, and on the other hand, to purchase cheap leather and other raw materials produced by Chinese farmers, hoping to cooperate and help each other.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano and Army Minister Terauchi made some replies regarding military industry and military reduction for retired soldiers. The meeting adjourned at 7:28 PM. (Domei News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 9:12 AM on the 8th. Prime Minister Hirota and all other cabinet members and committee members attended. First, Committee Chairman Kawasaki reported on the budget committee's schedule and other matters. Then, the additional budget for the 11th year was taken up as the topic, and questioning began.</p>
<p>The first questioner, Tei Kojiro (Minseito Party), rose and asked the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs, stating that it was inappropriate for diplomacy to be controlled by the three ministers in meetings.</p>
<p>Ministers Arita and Terauchi defended the possibility of such control. Tei then turned his attention to Prime Minister Hirota, saying that the people imagined that war was about to break out. He asked about the recent relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied that regarding Japan's international situation, including its relations with Russia, the world also had doubts. However, he took office as prime minister because he was confident that he could overcome these problems.</p>
<p>Tei asked what the general outlook was for Army equipment preparation costs and Navy shipbuilding costs.</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi replied that the new expenses for the 11th year belonged to the basic matters under consideration by the military, and that expenses for expanding the garrison in Manchuria, aviation, and air defense were appropriate. The expenses for the 12th year and beyond are currently under study. Although the numbers cannot be clearly indicated at present, the Army budget will temporarily increase in the future. Navy Minister Nagano replied that the specific numbers for Navy shipbuilding expenses could not be clearly indicated except in a closed-door meeting.</p>
<p>After Tei finished questioning, Wakamiya Sadao (Seiyukai) rose. First, he requested the dissemination of diplomatic knowledge to the Prime Minister. Then, he asked about the content of the communications and propaganda policy, and further asked about his belief in so-called national reform and upholding constitutional politics.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied that he also recognized the necessity of disseminating international knowledge to the people and that the government was preparing to expand and strengthen communications agencies and raise their level to the world standard. At this time, Uehara Seiichiro (Seiyukai) questioned the Prime Minister about the issues of parliamentary politics and constitutional operation, saying that the Prime Minister should not explicitly attribute the responsibility for social unrest to the parliament.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister clarified the reason why his statement did not have this meaning.</p>
<p>Wakamiya then asked that the government's proposed budget did not contain any ambition for national reform, which was a pity.</p>
<p>He then turned the topic to the issue of economic control, saying that the act of restricting the entire people for the elimination of a small portion of abuses should be approached with caution. He also said that there were too many government-appointed members on the various committees, which was not what people wanted. He asked what the Prime Minister's opinion was.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied that he would give it full consideration.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 12:05 AM. (Domei News Agency, 8th)</p>

When reporters asked whether the British and Japanese governments were concerned about the talks here, Morgenthau replied that what they were discussing was purely a matter between the US and China.

<p>(Washington) Economic experts here generally believe that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Chinese Bank's inspection team, intend to link the Chinese Yuan with the US dollar in exchange for the US guaranteeing the stability of the price of silver. Two independent observers familiar with the financial situation in the Far East expressed their opinions today, which were generally the same as Senator Thomas's statement yesterday, that the most important aspect of the Chen-Morgenthau talks was the issue of cooperation between the Chinese Yuan and the US dollar. However, both believed that the final result would be that China would sell its silver reserves to the US. Treasury officials declined to comment on this, while Chen Guangfu told the Associated Press, "The current discussions are still on general issues, so it is not yet time for comment." (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said today in response to questions about talks with Chinese financial experts Chen Guangfu and Guo Bingwen who were visiting the US that progress was accelerating, but the meeting had not yet ended. It is widely believed that what they are talking about is the extent to which the US can help China manage its currency. Morgenthau declined to discuss the foreign exchange situation, only saying that the market situation remained uneasy. Morgenthau firmly denied the rumor that the Treasury Department would use the profits from the silver purchase program to fund veterans' benefits. When asked whether the Treasury Department would allow gold to be shipped from New York to England to help stabilize the value of the British pound when France implemented a gold embargo, Morgenthau replied that this question was not convenient to answer.

<h3 id="e87">Guangzhou: Another Counterfeit Currency Case Cracked <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Five suspects arrested and sent to the Finance Department for interrogation. Counterfeit 50-cent notes sold for only 65% of their face value.</p>
<p>Since the province implemented currency reform, legal tender has been in high demand because silver is no longer in circulation. In addition to the provincial and municipal banks successively issuing new one-yuan and five-yuan notes to facilitate circulation, the provincial bank also printed a "50-cent" note through Xinhua Company in Hong Kong. The front features a blue print of the Pearl River Iron Bridge, and the back is ochre, with the face value of 50 cents written in Arabic numerals. Since its issuance, it has been easily counterfeited. Before long, a large number of counterfeit 50-cent notes were found on the market. The authorities became aware of the situation and, on one hand, announced that the provincial bank would recall the 50-cent notes, and on the other hand, sent detectives to investigate the source of the counterfeit currency. It was not until the 2nd of this month that a counterfeit currency trafficking organization was cracked. Initially, Hu, a field officer of the Agricultural Products Special Tax Bureau, discovered clues after more than a month of secret investigation. It was found that the 50-cent counterfeit notes printed by the criminals were sold at low prices, with each 100 yuan of counterfeit notes selling for only 65 yuan. Many unscrupulous merchants, taking advantage of the low price, purchased a large number and mixed them into the market. Hu persuaded a middleman, pretending to want to buy counterfeit notes for 400 yuan, and instructed the middleman to contact the sellers of the counterfeit notes. It was agreed that the deposit would be paid at the Xiangzhen Tea House in Ximen on the 2nd, and the counterfeit notes would be delivered at the Xuan Palace Hotel on Taiping South Road in the afternoon. Once the agreement was finalized, Hu immediately reported to the Agricultural Tax Bureau, which in turn reported to the Finance Department. On the same day, the Finance Department dispatched Commissioner Wu with a warrant, accompanied by Section Chief Lu and investigators Zhou and Lin of the Agricultural Tax Bureau, armed with firearms, to ambush the Xuan Palace Hotel. First, Hu, the field officer, accompanied the middleman to the Xiangzhen Tea House as scheduled to negotiate with the sellers of the counterfeit notes. After agreeing on the price, the sellers of the counterfeit notes arrived at the Xuan Palace Hotel with the counterfeit notes at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon. However, the criminals were very cunning, fearing they were being set up. First, they sent a person with a bamboo tube in his pocket, seemingly containing money, meaning that even if searched, there would be no evidence. If the person carrying the counterfeit currency arrived later, he could escape after hearing the news. Unexpectedly, the detectives turned the tables and treated the person who came to test the waters with kindness, without rashly searching him, so there was no commotion outside. Soon, the person carrying the counterfeit currency arrived, took out a bundle of counterfeit 50-cent notes from his pocket, saying that the total amount was only 150 yuan. The detective said it was not enough and asked him to bring more. The sellers of the counterfeit notes demanded 80 yuan before they would send more. Just as they were negotiating, a signal was given, and the Finance Department Commissioner and the Agricultural Tax Bureau investigators rushed in with guns, immediately capturing Wu Fa and two other sellers of counterfeit notes. They also dispatched detectives to Wu Fa's residence at No. 4, Penglai North Street, Guangxiao Branch, where they only found more than a dozen receipts for the sale of counterfeit notes, but no printing machines or other items were found. They also arrested a man named Chen at Wu's residence, who had more than 100 yuan of legal tender on him, claiming that he had come to buy counterfeit notes. Another man named Wu was also arrested. The above five suspects were transferred to the Finance Department's Preliminary Trial Office for interrogation on the same day. The counterfeit 50-cent notes that were seized were identical to the real ones in color and paper quality, and most ordinary people could not distinguish them. However, upon closer inspection, the numbers on the counterfeit notes all started with digits such as 1070000. The Finance Department is currently interrogating the seller of counterfeit notes, Wu Fa, to investigate the source in order to crack down on the counterfeit currency printing organization.

<h3 id="e88">Municipal Progress in Fuzhou <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Rivers - Streets - Tap Water</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In the upper reaches of the Min River, every spring and summer, there are continuous rainstorms, and the creeks and floods surge, and the river flows overflow, flowing directly into Fuzhou. The river channels in the city are silted up, and the water volume cannot be discharged, so the low-lying areas become swamp lands. After the floods, the soil becomes humid, leading to the breeding of epidemics, which affects the society and the people. The current Provincial Capital Works Department, in order to prevent floods, in addition to actively dredging the river channels in various places to facilitate the flow of water, will also repair the rainwater gates outside the northwest of the city. If there is a rise in the upstream water level, the water gates will be lowered to kill the water momentum. At the same time, the roadbeds of low-lying areas such as the Huancheng Road will be raised to act as dams to block the water force and prevent the upstream water flow from rushing into the provincial capital. At the same time, it is also planned to demolish all the piers of the Xiaobao Bridge on Nantai and build a new straight-beam bridge to facilitate the flow of water. The construction of roads and the repair of fences are currently under construction. However, the demolition of the bridge cannot be carried out immediately due to limited funds. However, this measure is of great importance to the people's livelihood, and the department is working hard to plan and strive to achieve its completion in the short term. As for the streets of the city, they are all dirty and overflowing. The most prosperous areas are the South Main Road and Zhongting Street. However, the streets in these areas are not very wide, and in the event of a fire, it is easy to spread. It has also been decided to expand them. At present, business is sluggish, and the people's strength may not be sufficient. However, the opening of roads is to facilitate traffic throughout the city, and also to develop the city's commerce. The government and the people should tolerate temporary pain and support its success. Regarding this plan, the surveying work of each road has been completed, and it will be started when the business is restored. As for all the civil houses and shops on both sides of the road, they will be recovered in accordance with the land price and the assessed value in the future, so that the people will not suffer any losses. However, the amount of this land price is too large, and it is definitely not the government's responsibility. According to the current measures promulgated by the central government, in addition to the demolition of the houses, the value will be given back, and the cost of road construction in the area will be estimated. Road fees will be collected from the newly built shops on both sides, depending on the business situation, not exceeding 60%. In this way, neither the government nor the people will suffer any losses. After the old shops on the side of the road are demolished, the houses behind them will leap forward, and traffic and business will be greatly facilitated. It seems not too important to collect these few road fees. The department is currently carefully considering this collection method to ensure that the people are not troubled and the traffic is convenient. In addition, the Provincial Capital Tap Water Preparatory Office has decided to build the water plant on Longtan Mountain on the right bank of the Min River, and is planning the requisition of land and the relocation of obstacles on the ground. As for the materials and machinery of the water plant, the calculation has been completed, and the Construction Department has sent letters to the Shanghai Purchasing Committee, the Construction Committee, the Central Trust Bureau, and a certain company to inquire about the value. Bids will be submitted on June 1st, and the start-up fee is estimated at more than 1.7 million yuan. As soon as the bidding is ready, construction will begin. (May 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Travels in Qinghai (Continued) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>(III) The Mongol Banner of Qunke Beach</p>
<p>Failure to go to Qaidam: The "Qaidam" basin occupies one-third of the area of Qinghai Province. It is close to Xinjiang and has a purely nomadic Mongol ethnicity. The climate is warm, and there are cultivated farmlands, but the desert land is sparsely populated, so few tourists and merchants go there. The political power has not yet extended there. The good wilderness is still a desolate white land. After returning to Xining from the Ta'er Temple, I harbored the ambition to invade this white land to investigate the Mongol ethnicity and geography, but there were more than a dozen horse stations between there and Xining. The road was all barren, so I had to bring my own tent. There was unrest on the road, so I had to bring guns, or have military escorts. It was not easy for someone empty-handed to come and go at will. At that time, I negotiated with the military headquarters, and they were very willing to send an adjutant who spoke Mongolian, two guards, and two riding horses to escort us. Therefore, we prepared all the necessary items for the road and waited. Soon, twelve days passed, and the adjutant in the military headquarters could not be sent out for a while. Most of them were on official business, and the remaining few could only speak Tibetan and not Mongolian. They insisted on staying a few more days.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 20th, we could not wait any longer. We went to Huangyuan to look for opportunities, or follow a large group of merchants. At eight o'clock in the morning, we hired a large car and left Xining City, heading west towards Huangyuan. The road was all paved. It had been sunny for a long time, and the dust was very heavy. Our tracheas were full of dust and sand brought up by the hooves of the mules in front. This ninety-li road was very long. It was not until after the sun went down at one o'clock that the two tired mules dragged us into a dark and dirty mule and horse shop. This is the East Pass of Huangyuan.</p>
<p>The next morning, we met the newly appointed County Chief Zhu and the Chamber of Commerce President in the county government. They showed concern about my going to Qaidam because it was the period of the lunar new year, and the large group of merchants had not yet started. If a few people went, it would be extremely difficult to defend themselves on the road, find lodging and food, and hire laborers and horses. Therefore, our hot hope was frustrated. Although I never wanted to give up the investigation of the Mongol ethnicity, after some consideration, I decided on the plan to go to Qunke Beach in northeastern Qinghai.</p>
<p>The scene of Huangyuan: We were delayed in Huangyuan for exactly one day. In the city, there were many Tibetans wandering on the street, wearing old sheepskin coats and holding a few newly peeled lamb skins, seeking to sell them, and there were also many Mongols coming and going, leading camels. This place is obviously a large commercial market. The transactions of Mongols and Tibetans in western Qinghai are concentrated here. The quantity of wool, lambskin, and medicinal materials exported every year is considerable. The total amount of wool alone is more than 2 million catties. This year, the price of wool in Tianjin is good, so the wool market is more active. The local market price is currently 15 yuan per hundred catties.</p>
<p>Huangyuan was formerly known as "Dangar." It was not until the second year of the Republic of China that it was changed to a county seat. It controls the throat of Mongol and Tibetan areas such as Qaidam and Yushu, so it is also very important in geographical terms. Now, west of Huangyuan, the number of Han and Hui residents gradually decreases and even disappears. People's lives have also regressed from agricultural society to nomadic society. People generally call the area west of Huangyuan "the outside."</p>
<p>The city is narrow and long, and the area is very small, half a mile east-west. The area of the entire county is very large, more than 4,300 square li, but it is still smaller compared to the area of other counties in the province. The terrain is 2,635 meters high, and the surrounding area is all flat land, facing the Bin of the Huangshui River. The land is fertile and produces crops, and the majestic poplars form sparse forests.</p>
<p>The residents in the city are divided into Han and Hui in ten places. The area around the East Pass is inhabited by Muslims. Most of the shops in the city are merchants from Shaanxi and Gansu. The traffic with the provincial capital is good, and cars can also travel on the main road. Postal and telephone services are also available. The highest schools in the county are the primary schools for boys and girls. In this important border area, education is backward and pitiful.</p>
<p>Eating in restaurants is very expensive. A plate of mutton costs 60 cents, and a plate of chicken costs 80 cents, but if you only eat rice and don't eat vegetables, the price is cheaper. A plate of sliced noodles or noodles costs only five cents, because it is the local people's custom to eat rice without eating vegetables often.</p>
<p>Strong wind blows down the horse: On the 22nd, we set off for "Qunke Beach." The county government sent a policeman and three district courier horses to escort us. Following the main road to the west, farmland and houses appeared in the poplar forest. Five li away, we reached the "Huangshui River." Here, we separated from the avenue to "Halakutu," turned north, and the farms of the Han people gradually became sparse. The mountain slopes on both sides were pressing towards the road.</p>
<p>The windy and sunny atmosphere also slowly turned into windy and gloomy weather. A burst of gusts of wind, from time to time mixed with sand and gravel, attacked our faces. The branches on the left and right were all roaring, and the air was filled with yellow dust. The surrounding scenery was all blurred.</p>
<p>Twenty li away, the Huangshui River flowed out of a steep mountain gorge. The river was frozen into two-foot-thick ice. Our horses stepped onto the slippery ice slope and went in. The oncoming wind blew more fiercely. The stone walls on both sides revealed jagged skeletons. Going in here is "Zasa Temple." We planned to rest in the temple for a while and drink a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp sound came from under the stone wall, and a large vortex of sand and wind rose, sweeping past us. This was our first experience. Our faces were stinging from being hit by gravel, our respirators were blocked, and our eyes were forced to close tightly. At this time, I leaned on the horse's back and tightened my legs, fearing that the horse would slip and fall. The sensible animal also lowered its head and stood still and could no longer move. At this time, we quietly waited for the storm to pass. After a minute, the roaring sound in our ears gradually died down. The wind had passed, and when we opened our eyes, we were blinded by yellow sand. We found that one of our old horses carrying luggage had been blown down on the ice. We were busy lifting it up. Fortunately, it was not injured, so we continued to move forward, carefully and quickly passing through the mouth of the gorge, preventing the second violent storm from striking.</p>
<p>Inside the mountain gorge, the place was much more open. The mountain dwellings were connected into a row of very small villages. On the mountain on the south bank of the river, there was a clump of green mountain forest, hiding many houses. That was the "Zacang Temple." We crossed the bridge to visit. In a continuous reception room, we drank a cup of tea and ate a piece of pancake. The Kanbu (abbot) in the temple also led us to visit the scripture hall and the Great Hall.</p>
<p>We wanted to travel another thirty li, so we hurriedly climbed back onto our horses and went north along the foothills. The fierce wind and sand still attacked from time to time. I lay on the horse's back and urged it forward, but the horse was also an animal, and it could not resist the natural violence, so its movements were very slow. When the wind was strong, it just stood still. In half an hour, we only traveled three li. Here, there were farmers' villages along the road. The slope was rising, and the altitude reached 2,840 meters. The wind was blowing harder and harder, and the oncoming sand and stones hit us so hard that we could not open our eyes. The dirt on our faces was like the bottom of a pot. We asked the police to find a place to stay. Fortunately, a Mongol Zhangjing (township head) invited us to his home. The Zhangjing's name was "Cao Getili." He was a Mongolian who could speak Chinese and was enlightened. Talking about everything in the evening was not lonely.</p>
<p>The eighth nomadic land: Early one morning, we left the village of "Baiyangxia," and the sincere and friendly Old Master Cao rode his horse and personally sent us twenty li to the north. That day, we were still going upstream along the Huang River. The river was two-thirds narrower than downstream of Huangyuan. There were still Mongols cultivating on the slopes on both sides, but the population was gradually decreasing. The cold was severe in the morning, but the wind was slight.</p>
<p>Twenty-five li later, the horse changed to the east bank of the Huang River and went forward. The mountains gradually spread to both sides, and the slopes became much gentler. The remaining yellow and withered grass covered the wilderness, showing the earth's dryness and lifelessness. The future was vast, and we could not see a single earthen house or a pedestrian. There was no formal road here either. Any mountain slope that the horses' hooves trampled on could be considered a road.</p>
<p>Near noon, the wind started to blow again. Because this place is very close to the sea, there is a strong wind every afternoon. A mountain ditch led us in, and we climbed a slope of thirty-five degrees again. From here, we saw a group of hundreds of cattle and sheep grazing on the meadow in front. When our line passed in front of them, they all tilted their heads and admired the style of our group of visiting travelers.</p>
<p>The cattle inside were all yaks with fur hanging down to the ground, and the sheep were all large-tailed sheep. It was the cold winter, so the down on the cattle and sheep was even more fluffy and cute. The dry grass had all withered and stuck to the ground, but they were still chewing with taste, so the water had not seen much weight loss, because they were the masters of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Two or three li ahead, there were a few black tents (this was the first time I saw the tents of nomads). The big shaggy dogs were already barking when they saw the silhouettes of people in the distance. The mountain road went around the back of the tent. The barking of the shaggy dogs awakened the owners of several black tents to come out and see what was going on.</p>

<p>Due to continuous rainfall in recent days, the Kunshan-Taicang motor road has become uneven, causing great inconvenience for vehicles. Road workers are currently repairing it in sections. However, these workers are constantly taking advantage of their position to cause trouble, committing adultery, robbery, and all sorts of crimes. Nearby villagers have suffered greatly. Around 2 PM on the seventh, Lin Ruifen, a concubine of Wu Zijin, a resident of Zhendong Township, was traveling from Taicang to the township with her adopted daughter, Meiya, when they were suddenly stopped near Wutang Bridge by road workers. One of them, Li Yusheng from Liyang, grabbed Lin by the waist and held her. Another worker robbed her of a diamond ring worth over five hundred yuan. Meiya, witnessing this, ran to tell her father. Wu Zijin went and bravely captured Li Jinsheng, handing him over to the police station at the West Gate for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for judicial proceedings. It is reported that other workers are making threatening noises and are unwilling to submit.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Suzhou Panic Over the Implementation of Public Prostitution <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Public prostitution has been implemented in Suzhou. The Public Security Bureau is being very strict in cracking down on private prostitution and prohibiting gambling in brothels. Public and private prostitutes are not allowed to stay or hide in hotels. Hotels found to be violating this regulation will have their licenses revoked. As a result, hotels are in a state of panic because it is difficult to distinguish prostitutes from respectable women. The Hotel Industry Association has petitioned the county government for relief. The county government issued a reply yesterday stating: "We are aware of your petition. Is it really that difficult to distinguish people from Qilou (brothels)? Why is it that hotel staff can procure prostitutes whenever a guest requests one? These women have their own nests. Unless a guest keeps them, why would they be alone and lonely in a hotel, keeping watch alone at night? As for visiting relatives and friends, everyone is free to do so, and the association cannot prohibit it. However, the drinker's heart is not in the wine. If they are using this as an excuse to engage in prostitution and entice customers, should the hotel not be responsible for prohibiting it? In the past, hotel staff considered introducing prostitutes to guests as a source of profit, and the responsible personnel of each member hotel did not prohibit it in order to increase business, damaging public morals and harming travelers. This has been a long-standing practice. Now that the government has explicitly ordered a crackdown, the members of the association are not only failing to comply with the instructions but are daring to use sophistry to try to evade responsibility, which is extremely ignorant of the greater good. Your request is denied." Furthermore, a group of prostitutes (from high-end brothels) at the Cangxian Villa were caught gambling by the Public Security Bureau, and their patrons, including Wang Mingdong, were arrested. As a result, the high-end brothels are in a state of panic, believing that such restrictions by the Public Security Bureau will make it impossible to conduct business. They are also requesting leniency from the authorities. If their requests are not met, they are determined to surrender their licenses and cease operations.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Silk Industry to Petition the Government <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Wu County yarn and satin shops, iron weaving factories, and silk industry associations, noting that Wu County is a silk-producing area, with over 30,000 silk weavers ten years ago and all products sold to the Northeast provinces and the South Sea Islands, have seen a sharp decline in Suzhou yarn and satin sales due to the prevalence of rayon and the dumping of foreign goods. Now there are only over 2,000 silk weavers, and silk weaving factories are in danger. With recent rampant smuggling in North China, rayon is being imported in large quantities, causing public anxiety and further lowering the prices of silk products. Therefore, leaders of these industries have decided to petition the government to quickly establish a rayon factory to reduce costs and make silk products easier to sell, thereby maintaining the livelihoods of workers and regaining control. As for the issue of saving natural silk, it is reported by those in the industry that the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly discussed uniting large and small silk factories in both provinces to organize a Jiangsu-Zhejiang Joint Silk Reeling Company, to increase quality, reduce production costs, and facilitate sales abroad. If this plan can be realized, the silk industry of Wu County may have a hope of revival.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Pharmacy Apprentice Falls from Building and Commits Suicide <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Pang Ruichun, an apprentice at Zhang Renzhi Tang Pharmacy, located west of the Jieguan Pavilion in Beitang, this city, which is run by traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhang Tianan, was 18 years old and from Gushan, Jiangyin. He had completed his apprenticeship this year. On the afternoon of the fifth of this month, Ruichun went upstairs to fetch medicinal materials, accidentally lost his footing, and fell to the ground. He immediately lost consciousness. The pharmacy did not call a doctor for treatment and left him moaning in bed. Ruichun's brother, Ruibiao, learned of this and transported him to Puren Hospital for treatment. However, when the cart reached Mianjin Bridge at the South Gate, he had already died from his injuries. The deceased's face was blue and purple, and his abdomen was swollen, which was quite strange. The body was temporarily placed in the Yaohuang Temple on Sanhuang Street. Mao Zijun, the head of the fourth district in the north, reported to the local court requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, the prosecutor, accompanied by Shen, a coroner, and judicial police chief Zhu Wanyuan, went to perform the autopsy at 10 AM yesterday (the 8th). The autopsy revealed several abrasions on the deceased's body and a blue-purple abdomen, suggesting poisoning. Coroner Shen could not conduct a thorough examination because he did not bring the necessary equipment. The prosecutor ordered the district head to guard the body pending a second autopsy. Around 2 PM in the afternoon, the prosecutor and others returned for a second autopsy, which confirmed that the death was due to poisoning.</p>

<p>Ren Cai, a young woman originally from Jiangbei, was 26 years old. She married a doctor from her hometown, but he died not long after. Cai became destitute and wandered around. Two years ago, she came to Changshu, where her life became even more difficult. She became acquainted with and cohabited with Ren Jinsong, a rickshaw puller. The woman had two children, one nine years old and the other six. It was difficult for Ren to support the whole family of four with his rickshaw pulling. So, the woman set up a small stall near Fangqiao, which allowed them to barely make a living. Unfortunately, her lover, Jinsong, succumbed to temptation and turned to theft. Recently, he stole something from a Mr. Li from the North Gate and was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The woman, filled with shame and anxiety, committed suicide by drowning herself in a well. At first, those nearby did not notice Cai's disappearance. It was not until the afternoon of the seventh that a hotel apprentice found her body in the well while drawing water. The authorities were notified, and an autopsy and funeral arrangements were made. Her lover, who is in custody, is being kept in the dark, as the authorities fear he will be distraught.</p>

As the counties do not have farmers' banks or cooperative societies, and handle small-scale agricultural product mortgage loans, which have a considerable foundation, they will draft measures and submit them to the provincial government for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third, the Yantian (salt) Affairs Tax Police Team in Shenjiamen, Dinghai, seized six Shaoxing salted seafood boats while inspecting salted seafood boats in Donghengtang. The fish salt on the upper layer was mixed with discolored chaff, and the lower layer was all white salt, which suggested they were evading the taxes. The six boat masters, Wang Guozhong, Hong Xinmin, Jiang Qinglin, Lü Waqing, Wang Jincan, and Lü Acai, were detained. Shaoxing fishermen were outraged that their fish salt, which had already changed color after weighing, was seized and the people were detained. Three hundred Shaoxing fishermen gathered, each holding a lit incense stick, and requested assistance from the local Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to negotiate with the Tax Police Team. Captain Huang Yuanxun, fearing that the matter would escalate, went to the Dinghai district headquarters for instructions. The six detained boatmen are temporarily being held at the local Public Security Branch. The fishermen, feeling unexpectedly oppressed, have decided to join forces with various fish stalls and associations to appeal to judicial and higher-level salt affairs authorities. It remains to be seen how this will be resolved.</p>

<p>Various Organizations Including the Association of Machine Industries (機聯會) Hold Meetings to Discuss the Matter</p>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry convened its Executive Committee at 115 Hankou Road at 4 PM yesterday to discuss the issues of North China smuggling and opposing the reduction of import tariffs. Members present were Dai Gengxin, Hu Xiyuan, Yao Xizhou, Wang Yunwu, Weng Yousan, Zhu Gengtao, Cai Shengbai, Wu Yunxu, Wang Qiyu, Wang Yaochen, Lu Fei Bohong, Guo Shun, Xu Guanqun, and Xu Xiaochu.

<p>Regarding the increasingly rampant smuggling in North China, which will seize the entire national market if it continues, it was decided to electrically request the government to quickly adopt effective measures to strictly crack down on it.</p>
<p>Regarding the report that the government is considering reducing the import tariffs on sugar and rayon, it was decided to handle it together with the smuggling issue.</p>
<p>Uphold Tariff Rates</p>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry electrically addressed the central government, stating: "To Premier Jiang, Vice Premier Kong, Minister of Finance Kong, and Minister of Industry Wu of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: The smuggling in North China has caused alarm among industrialists and merchants across the country. It poses a grave threat to our national production enterprises. At a time when all industries are declining, it is already difficult to maintain them, let alone withstand such a major blow. Recently, it has become increasingly rampant, spreading almost throughout the country. If this continues, not only will our national goods market be completely seized, but it will also affect our country's tariff revenue, causing untold harm. As the central hub for domestic industries and merchants, the association is responsible for leading and safeguarding the national industry. Alarmed by the situation, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to electrically request your esteemed departments to quickly adopt effective measures to strictly crack down on smuggling and maintain the original tariff rates in order to protect the national economy. This would be a great fortune for the people and industry.

<p>Clearly Define the Power of Trade Associations, Drawing Lessons from Neighboring Countries</p>
<p>Establish Various Industries and Refund Import Taxes on Raw Materials</p>
<p>The China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association previously submitted three requests to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, which have been accepted. However, detailed measures need to be drafted and submitted to the ministry for approval. Therefore, the association convened a board meeting a few days ago to discuss: Clearly defining the power of trade associations in law, requiring all members of the same industry to join their respective trade associations to strengthen the existing organization of each industry. Gu Bingyuan was nominated to preside over this, and Li Zuyu, Gu Bingyuan, and Fang Yixian were elected to form a subcommittee to study the articles of association of trade associations, propose reforms to the articles of association, and then hold a general meeting for discussion, submitting them to the government for revision. Additionally, the association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will jointly request the Ministry of Industry to appoint a special commissioner to visit Japan to study Japanese laws and regulations regarding trade associations for reference. Establishing various industries should be based on the overall interests of the nation, considering the suitability of different regions. The government should evaluate and implement centralized control. Lu Zhixue was nominated to preside over this, and Zhuang Zhongwen, Lu Zhixue, and Zhu Yangchen were elected to form a subcommittee to study and then submit a request to the government for adoption. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry, provincial governments, and engineering societies are asked to pay attention to this matter. When national products are transported and sold abroad, the government is requested to refund import taxes on raw materials. Cai Shengbai was nominated to preside over this, and it was resolved that the association would request the government to adopt the principle of refunding raw material taxes on exported national products.

<p>Plans to Establish a Sample Exhibition Center</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Chaolong, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Surabaya, Netherlands East Indies, who recently returned from Nanyang, is very enthusiastic about promoting Chinese goods in Nanyang. Therefore, after returning to China, in addition to visiting factories in various places, he also contacted national products organizations. Mr. Huang plans to set up a National Products Exhibition Hall in Surabaya, and his plan is quite large. After consulting with organizations such as the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, they all advocated establishing a sample exhibition center, with a scale that does not need to be too large, but must be established in major commercial ports to widely promote it. Therefore, this matter is still under negotiation. Mr. Huang also intends to organize a National Products Introduction Center in Surabaya, which has been agreed to by the China National Products Introduction General Office. However, the Surabaya authorities have very strict restrictions on the import of foreign goods, adhering to old rules. The import trade is still controlled by their nationals, and our compatriots are only second merchants. Now Mr. Huang is determined to break this old rule to improve trade relations with our country. He has obtained the consent of the authorities, but the imported goods must be exchanged for local products, which is a kind of trade protection policy for the area. However, according to surveys, Surabaya's trade with our country has always been a surplus, and its main product is sugar. Therefore, if the principle of bartering is implemented, the amount of national products transported to Surabaya can be increased. It is reported that the capital of the introduction center is set at 200,000 yuan, and the General Office has agreed to ship the goods there once the capital is raised and the organization is established.</p>

<p>Over 3,330,000 Yuan Already Cast and Issued</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Mint to cast and issue new auxiliary coins, which are being exchanged and issued by the Central Bank. Currently, they are being widely promoted in major cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as in important cities and towns across the country with branches of the Central Bank. According to the factory's issuance figures as of May 1st, the auxiliary coins that have been released from the factory include 11.16 million half-cent copper coins, 27.34 million one-cent copper coins, 6.8 million five-cent nickel coins, 1.9 million ten-cent nickel coins, and 860,000 twenty-cent nickel coins. Together with the various auxiliary coins cast during the trial casting, a total of 83.74 million coins have been produced, totaling 131.8 million coins, with a total value of 3,334,800 yuan. Currently, because the mint no longer casts silver coins, except for casting a small number of factory bars, all work is focused on casting various auxiliary coins in order to promote them nationwide. The old copper coins and silver dimes collected by the mint are stored within the facility and not melted down for recasting, as the existing copper materials are sufficient for current use.</p>

<p>In Preparation for Future Oil Extraction</p>
<p>Solicits Participation from All Sectors Yesterday</p>
<p>Yu Shunqing, standing committee member of the Shanghai National Coal Production and Sales Association, in order to lay the foundation for domestic oil and prevent leakage, in addition to jointly organizing the Puli Petroleum Company with political and business circles to plan the extraction of oil in Sichuan Province, has also initiated the organization of a public petroleum investigation team to go to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces to investigate oil fields in preparation for future extraction. Mr. Yu sent letters to leaders from all walks of life yesterday, soliciting participation. The original letter reads: Dear Sir/Madam, I attended the dedication ceremony of the new clubhouse of the Chinese Aviation Association on May 5th and listened attentively to the speeches of Minister Tu, Mayor Wu, and Secretary-General Lin. The establishment of the Aviation Association is to assist national facilities, strengthen national defense, and promote air transportation, which is indeed an urgent task. On the one hand, it cultivates a national mindset, making everyone love the country, purchase airplanes, and subsidize the raw materials used in airplanes. The so-called raw materials, in addition to the iron and hardware used in the manufacture of the airplane itself, the subsidized raw material is gasoline. I, Yu Shunqing, found a type of oil in the Ziliujing area of Sichuan Province in the 20th year of the Republic, which can be refined into gasoline. The results of the testing by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau were excellent, and I have already presented them to the dignitaries of Shanghai. However, I cannot bear the burden alone, and without the concerted efforts and cooperation of people from all walks of life, the desired effect cannot be achieved. Therefore, there is the organization of a public petroleum investigation team, planning to go to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces to investigate oil fields in preparation for future oil extraction. However, I am insignificant and have limited economic means, making it difficult to achieve my ambitions. I sincerely hope that enthusiastic comrades will resolutely participate and cooperate in the undertaking. I am willing to be a guide, and when results are achieved, I will report to the authorities for adoption, which is the first aid in defending against aggression and strengthening national defense. If you do not abandon me, please come to my office at any time to discuss the plan, which is my greatest hope.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Shanghai Citizen Training Office Established; Issues Open Letter to Shanghai Citizens <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote local autonomy and political tutelage, the municipal government has established the Shanghai Citizen Training Office, appointing Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, as the director, Li Xiangqi and Jiang Huaisu as the deputy directors, and Wang Shaoqi, Secretary of the Municipal Government, as the general secretary. Li Xiangqi, the deputy director, concurrently serves as the general captain, and Tao Yishan has been appointed as the deputy general captain. The internal staff are all transferred from the various organs affiliated with the municipal government. The office location has been designated as No. 158 Jinji Road, and operations began on the 20th of last month. All plans have been prepared and are expected to be implemented within this month. The government issued an open letter to the citizens of Shanghai yesterday, stating: Dear citizens, the draft constitution, which is the fundamental plan of the Republic of China, has been promulgated, and the National Assembly will be convened on a set date. In the near future, the constitutional era that we have been looking forward to will be fully realized. However, the nation in the constitutional era requires citizens with sufficient common sense, strong bodies, and a disciplined and organized society. In other words, it requires local autonomy to be well-managed to serve as the foundation for national construction. Sun Yat-sen's National Construction Plan stipulates that during the tutelage period, the government should guide the people's ability to govern themselves. The Shanghai Municipal Government is the organ responsible for local tutelage in Shanghai. Now, in order to rapidly complete the tutelage work and promote local autonomy, the Shanghai Citizen Training Office has been specially established to train the citizens of Shanghai to become healthy citizens, which shows how much the government values ​​this matter. The training methods have been generally determined. All healthy citizens between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five living in the city area will be called for training in stages, each stage lasting two or three months. Upon completion of the training, the government will issue certificates. The scale of each training session will be between three thousand and five thousand people. The training time is stipulated before 9:00 AM and after 5:00 PM, so as not to interfere with the current work time of the citizens. All plans have now been fully prepared, and the first phase will begin within five months. Citizens who are called up are expected to report to the designated police station on time and according to their assigned teams, because enthusiastic participation in training will be rewarded, and those who evade training will be punished. In addition to the general methods, we also have a method to facilitate group training. If the various trade associations, hometown associations, companies, schools, factories, labor unions, and other professional groups in the city have a large number of people, if they can all voluntarily organize separately and request training, we can organize and train them based on their existing organization. We expect to complete the first phase of training in July of this year, and then begin the second phase. At the same time, Shanghai will pilot autonomy and implement the Baojia system. In the future, all Bao and Jia chiefs will naturally be elected from organized and trained citizens to form the foundation of Shanghai's autonomy. If we want the country to be strong, we must revitalize our national spirit, especially in Shanghai, where the social atmosphere is so decadent, which requires a kind of stimulation. Therefore, we hope that the leaders of various industries should lead their people to receive training, and parents and elder brothers should urge their children to receive training. Shop owners or managers should assign their employees and partners to receive training, and others should also voluntarily request to join the training. In short, "the rise and fall of the nation are the responsibility of every citizen." National affairs are our duty, and everyone should enthusiastically promote everything that is beneficial to the country and society, and be willing to sacrifice personal interests. Dear citizens, we should feel that our responsibility is great and our personal future is promising at a time when the country is in serious difficulty. Do not hesitate or wait any longer. You should register as soon as possible and wait to be assigned to receive this glorious training.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Xingye Trust Company: Launches Real Estate Trust Business <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Establishes Seven Regulations...Officially Announces Commencement of Operations Yesterday</p>
<p>According to sources, the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company, in order to revive the market and stimulate finance, has begun to handle real estate trust business. There are a total of seven regulations for its business methods, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Motive for Operation: The company, considering that since the Ministry of Finance implemented the monetary policy, the financial situation of various industries across the country has shifted from a gloomy environment to a bright outlook, and that it will not be difficult to move towards prosperity in the future. However, to revive various industries, real estate business must be stimulated first. Although the Municipal Finance Bureau previously sent letters to both the banking and money industries, encouraging them to undertake real estate mortgage loans, and instructed them to list Chinese-owned real estate as reserve assets, it is still difficult for various firms and banks to handle this business universally. In order to stimulate market capital, the company has specially launched real estate trust business, and can accept and handle real estate in both the Chinese and foreign concessions. The company issued an announcement yesterday stating, "To facilitate property owners, we have agreed with the Finance and Land Bureaus to handle the above-mentioned business. (Details of the trust methods are below.) Procedures are simple, time is quick, and fees are extremely low. If entrusted, we would be most welcoming. Printed regulations are available upon request."</p>
<p>Trust Methods: The regulations for the company's property department in handling real estate trust business are recorded as follows: Replacing and Obtaining Land Deeds: When replacing and obtaining land deeds, the required property certificates must be deposited with the company, and the company will issue a receipt. Unless there are disputes over property rights, the company will, based on the complexity of the matter and the time required, handle the application on behalf of the client and collect all fees stipulated by the various bureaus, which will be borne by the client. Surveying, Dividing, or Merging Land Deeds: The required property certificates must be deposited with the company, and the company will complete the application and obtain the deeds in due course. Transferring Ownership or Mortgage Registration: The property certificates must be deposited with the company, and a transfer application or mortgage registration application must be signed to handle the transfer or registration on behalf of the client. The property certificates will be returned after completion the next day. All fees stipulated by the various bureaus will be borne by the client. Paying Land Value Tax and Field Tax on Behalf of Client: The required documents and taxes must be handed over to the company for payment on behalf of the client. The date on which the company receives the payment will be considered the date of tax payment. Selling Real Estate on Behalf of Client: The property certificates or their drawings must be sent to the company for registration (the original will be returned), and a letter of authorization must be signed, stating the minimum price per mu, so that the company can find buyers on behalf of the client. As for large properties that need to be divided for sale, the client must hand over all property certificates to the company for division on behalf of the client, with expenses borne by the client. The company may sell part or all of it. If property disputes arise in the real estate entrusted for sale, the seller shall be responsible. As for the fees payable to the various bureaus, they shall be borne by the buyer or seller respectively, in accordance with the regulations of the various bureaus. Purchasing Real Estate on Behalf of Client: Specify the area and price limit and register with the company, or submit one-tenth of the price limit as a deposit and sign a letter of authorization. If the transaction cannot be completed within the specified period, the deposit will be returned, along with interest at an annual rate of 5%. As for the fees payable to the various bureaus upon completion of the transaction, they shall also be borne by the buyer or seller respectively, in accordance with the regulations. Consultation: For all real estate matters in Shanghai, inquiries can be made by letter or in person. The company will provide detailed replies. (Note) These regulations may be revised from time to time without further notice, but shall not affect cases that have already been entrusted.</p>

It was resolved and passed that another letter would be sent to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to protest to the Public Works Department and cancel the basic resolution number, calculating it at three cents per resolution. Regarding how the association should handle users' reports of the telephone company's inflated resolution number, it was resolved that the users would be directed to negotiate directly with the company. Regarding how the association should handle letters from users in various districts and register disconnected users, it was resolved that the secretariat would handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Completely Levying Tax on Foreign Broken Rice <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xin'yi Returns to Shanghai from Beijing</p>
<p>Has Explained to the Rice Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of levying taxes on foreign broken rice, the Municipal Bean and Rice Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, proposing to follow the precedent of Ningbo, to levy a full tax by the Ministry of Finance. It was previously stipulated that items not listed would still be subject to half tax. The request was rejected by the Ministry of Finance. Gu Xin'yi, chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, recently went to Beijing again to make a request. Gu has now returned to Shanghai. It is understood that the Shanghai side had previously ordered 100,000 bags of broken rice from foreign merchants, of which 60,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai and 40,000 bags will arrive soon. The Ministry of Finance's reason for not following the Ningbo precedent was that the foreign broken rice ordered by Ningbo was for disaster relief purposes and not comparable to general business circumstances. After Gu's explanation to the rice industry, all the foreign broken rice that has arrived has been subject to full taxes in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's new regulations, and goods have been picked up from customs. The remaining 40,000 bags are also prepared to pay full taxes. It is also understood that importing foreign rice is no longer cost-effective at current market prices, so the import of foreign rice will be reduced in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Director of Guangdong Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, Feng Rui, Expresses Opinions on Reducing Sugar Tax <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong's Sugar Industry Still Requires Considerable Time to Succeed</p>
<p>Reducing Tariffs Suddenly is Like Weaning an Infant</p>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and Manager of the Sugarcane Manufacturing Plant, flew to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with various authorities, report on the latest developments in the Guangdong sugar industry, and inquire about the truth regarding recent reports of foreigners requesting a reduction in sugar taxes. Before his departure, he expressed his opinions on reducing sugar taxes to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Five-Year Plan: We believe that Guangdong's sugar industry can compete with the well-established sugar industries of Java, Cuba, the Philippines, and Taiwan, and if given a little more time and opportunity, it will certainly be possible. Guangdong's land and climate have been repeatedly investigated and studied by sugar experts William G. Hallo, Prof. KingDr., and Bannier, who all believe that they are suitable for developing the sugar industry. The points that should be emphasized are the improvement of sugarcane varieties and the improvement of methods such as planting, fertilization, and irrigation. This section is also being planned and carried out, and will be completed within five years. The British government levies a standard tax of 11 shillings and 8 pence on every 112 pounds of sugar, in addition to the following surtaxes. During the period from 1924 to 1927, the tax was 19 shillings and 6 pence per 112 pounds; from 1928 to 1930, 13 shillings; from 1931 to 1933, 6 shillings and 6 pence; and from 1933 to the present, 6 shillings and 6 pence. In order to protect its sugar industry, the British Indian government decided to levy a tax of 9 rupees and 1 anna per 112 pounds, starting in 1931, for a period of ten years. Since its implementation, production has increased from 60,000 tons in 1931 to 600,000 tons. The development of the sugar industry depends on technology and science. If the foundation of technology and science is not solid, the cost cannot be reduced, and it will be difficult to match other countries. According to the experiences of Java, the Philippines, Taiwan, and other places, the solution to technical and other problems takes at least five years. From this, it can be seen that the protection period for our country's sugar industry cannot be less than five years. At present, Guangdong's sugar industry is in the process of improvement, and the cost of white sugar is as high as 20 yuan per picul, so even with tariff protection, the profit is very small.</p>
<p>Tariff Protection: What foundation is Guangdong's sugar industry built upon? The establishment and existence of Guangdong's sugar industry is based on protective tariffs. All plans are based on tariff rates. Without this, the current Guangdong sugar industry would be unable to survive. Therefore, the Guangdong sugar industry is like a newborn infant being fed by tariffs. Reducing tariffs suddenly is like cutting off its food and driving it to compete with the strong and robust sugar industries of Java and Taiwan. The result is foreseeable. Attitude of Foreign Sugar Industry: Over the past two years, important personnel and experts from the foreign sugar industry have come to Guangdong one after another, paying close attention to the sugar industry. After their investigation, they all believe that all difficulties can be overcome within a few years and success can be achieved. Its production factors, such as fertile land and suitable climate, are all available compared to Java, Taiwan, and other places. With tariff protection and five years of effort, Guangdong sugar can not only supply the entire country's consumption, but also be exported to foreign countries and compete in the world market. Furthermore, reducing tax rates will not only affect Guangdong's sugar industry, but also the industrialists in other sugarcane-producing provinces, such as Fujian, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, will also terminate their investment plans.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Facilities: Guangdong's three-year construction plan and sugar industry facilities. Guangdong's economic situation is that every year, more than 100 million yuan worth of cotton and cotton fabrics, 200 million yuan worth of grains and rice, 50 million yuan worth of oils, and 30 million yuan worth of various fertilizers are imported from home and abroad. In addition to sugar, there are very few other major export goods. Therefore, Guangdong's three-year construction plan is almost entirely focused on the development of the sugar industry. 50 million yuan has been invested, of which 40 million yuan has not yet been paid to the contractors of various sugar factories, such as the Skoda Ironworks in the Czech Republic and the Honolulu Iron Works. The payment method is set for three or five years, paid in monthly installments. These foreign manufacturers are deeply convinced that Guangdong's sugar industry will be successful if given a five-year tariff protection period. The Guangdong authorities are doing their best to raise funds and divert all surplus tax revenue and military reserve funds to sugar industry construction. If it fails without protection, the entire province's economy will be affected, the sugar industry will go bankrupt, and the lives of millions of people connected to it will be seriously disrupted. It is permissible to say that if the sugar tax is slightly reduced, other industries will inevitably demand the same, and the capital sector will terminate domestic industrial investment. I fear that the example of sugar tax reduction will be applied to all commodities.</p>
<p>Comparison of Tax Rates: Comparison of import tax rates for sugar in various countries. Germany levies a tax of 71.32 per metric quintal, the Czech Republic 71.15, Austria 59.58, Hungary 95.29, France 56.18, Belgium 90.48, the Netherlands 92.29, Poland 151.46, Italy 151.48, Romania 34.59, Estonia 7.59, British India 22.30, and China 21.76. Comparing the import tax rates for sugar in the thirteen countries listed in the table, the highest are Italy and Poland, at 151.48 yuan per metric quintal, and the lowest is our country, at 21.76 yuan per metric quintal. The tax rates in Italy and Poland are six times higher than ours, and the average tax rate in various countries is 72.81 yuan, which is three times higher than ours. Therefore, in any case, it is difficult to reduce our country's sugar tariffs.</p>
<p>Must Be Protected: The number of people who depend on the old and new sugar industries. The country's annual sugar production is 15 million piculs, including the slab sugar produced by old-style sugar mills in Guangdong, Sichuan, Fujian, and Guangxi. The number of people working directly and indirectly in the sugar industry is at least 10 million. The output in 1930 suddenly dropped to 4 million piculs because of low tax rates and cheap foreign sugar being dumped in large quantities. After the sugar tax rate was changed in 1932, the sugar industry has had the opportunity to revive. If the current tax rate is reduced, the old and new sugar industries will be destroyed without a trace. Our country will once again be forced to purchase the same amount of foreign sugar as in 1930. As a result, our country's silver reserves will be reduced by at least 120 million yuan per year due to the purchase of sugar, and at the same time, the trade situation will become even more unbalanced. Therefore, for the sake of the future revival of the sugar industry and for the sake of the country's economic future, the domestic sugar industry must be vigorously protected.</p>

<p>Confirmed by Court Ruling Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of wealthy Wuxing merchant Xu Guannan, filed for bankruptcy in the First Special District Court due to excessive spending and accumulated debts, as his parents were unwilling to repay them on his behalf. The court approved the application and appointed accountant Wang Enfang as the bankruptcy administrator. At the time, one of Xu's creditors was Ying Huizhen, the proprietress of the Wendishuju brothel, with a claim of 10,000 yuan. However, during the creditors' meeting, the actual amount Xu Qizhong should repay was only 1,000 yuan, which led the creditors to doubt Ying's claim. The executive judge then ordered Ying to file a lawsuit for confirmation. Ying immediately hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit for confirmation with the First Special District Court. After the trial concluded, the details were recorded in this newspaper. Judge Zhang Yuhai of the First Special District Court held a hearing yesterday and announced the ruling, stating that the principal amount of the debt owed by Xu Qizhong to the plaintiff should be 10,000 national currency, and the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant.</p>

<p>Aftermath of the Xue Mailuo Robbery Case</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the robbery of 12,000 yuan from the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm on June 9, 1934, which involved four people, including Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Zai Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, the third instance concluded and the four were acquitted. Now, Zhuang Jimeng first filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court against Zhang Zuming for defamation. After being informed that it lacked jurisdiction, the case was transferred to the Second Special District Court for handling. Zhang Zuming also hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Zhou Jinggeng (the manager of Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm) for defamation, and attached a civil lawsuit to recover losses. The two cases were heard once by Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special District Court. Due to the need to examine the case files of the previous case, the hearing was adjourned to a later date for consolidation. The details have been recorded in the previous report. These two cases are now scheduled to be heard at 2:00 PM today in the Second Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, still by Judge Li.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Confiscated Supernatural Films <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Taken by the Central Film Inspection Board for Review; Further Verification Required by Mr. Wu Yuanfa</p>
<p>The Central Film Inspection Board maintains a strict policy regarding supernatural films. Following a tip-off that Qian Guozhang, residing at No. 12 Jingqing Lane, East-West Huade Road, Shanghai Public Concession, and Bi Shoutang, residing at No. 14 Yile Lane, Tangshan Road, were specializing in shooting supernatural films such as "The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea," the board dispatched officials to, along with Tang Bao, an inspector from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, obtain a search warrant from the First Special District Court. At 11:45 AM the day before yesterday, they, in collaboration with Huang Fugen, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station, first went to No. 12 Jingqing Lane. However, as it was discovered that there was no Qian Guozhang residing at that address, no search was conducted. Subsequently, they went to No. 14 Yile Lane. There, they found two iron boxes of film in the front building and 53 reels of film in the attic. According to Mr. Bi, the owner of the house, these films were pawned there by a friend of Bi Zhijin but were never redeemed, so they have remained in his house until now. The detectives then took the 55 reels of film to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were presented to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, explained the situation and stated that it was still difficult to ascertain whether the seized films were indeed the aforementioned "Eight Immortals Cross the Sea." Today, the Film Inspection Board sent personnel to the court to request that the seized films be taken for review. Regarding this point, he requested a ruling from the court. Subsequently, Yang Minshi, legal counsel to the Central Film Inspection Board, filed a case requesting that the films be taken to Beijing. Because the seized items were master copies and could not be screened, they needed to be made into film reels for screening to determine whether they violated any laws or regulations. Finally, Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the request and approved the release of the 55 reels of seized films to Yang Minshi of the Central Film Inspection Board and Tang Bao, inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, for review, followed by further verification.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Apprentice Dies Tragically at Wuhua Shoe Factory; Autopsy Conducted <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Confirmed as Stabbed to Death by Scissors; Perpetrator's Confession Attempts to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM the day before yesterday, a stabbing occurred at the Wuhua Shoe Factory in Yuanmao Lane, Arabella Street, due to a dispute over work, resulting in the death of an apprentice. Details of this incident have already been reported in the newspaper. It is now known that the Wuhua Shoe Factory has two plants, an old one at No. 145 North Zhejiang Road and a new one at No. 18 Yuanmao Lane, Arabella Street. The average daily workload for apprentices is 30 pairs of shoe uppers per person. Yesterday morning at 6:30 AM, Yuan Wenzai (21 years old, from Haimen), an apprentice from the new plant, went to the old plant to collect shoe uppers. However, Wei Xianrong (18 years old, from Zhenjiang), an apprentice from the old plant, only gave him 20 pairs, leading to a dispute. Wei reported this to Zhang Jinfa, the bookkeeper in the new plant's accounting room. At that time, Yuan Wenzai had also returned. They encountered each other at the entrance, and Yuan blamed Wei for reporting such a minor matter to the accounting room, leading to a second dispute and mutual assault. Wei suddenly produced a pair of sharp scissors from his person and stabbed Yuan Wenzai five times, hitting vital areas. Yuan collapsed in a pool of blood. Colleagues from the factory, including Wang Kanghui, restrained Wei and reported the incident to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched officer Li Wenbin to take Wei Xianrong, along with the murder weapon, to the Huishi Police Station for detention. Yuan Wenzai was rushed to Renji Hospital but died on the way due to the severity of his injuries. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Center on Peel Road. Yesterday morning, Wei Xianrong was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution for homicide under Article 271 of the Criminal Law and presented the case, stating that, according to the doctor's examination, the deceased Yuan Wenzai had three wounds on his left chest, two on his left back, and one on the back of his hand, totaling five stab wounds. According to the defendant's confession at the police station, he used the scissors to defend himself because the deceased had punched him first, and he presented the scissors as evidence, stating that there was still blood on them. Under questioning, Wei Xianrong confessed that he was an apprentice at the old Wuhua factory. Yesterday morning, the deceased wanted 30 pairs of shoe uppers, but he only gave him 20 pairs, leading to a conflict. He then reported this to the accounting room, but Yuan followed him and punched him at the entrance of the new factory, leading to a scuffle. Later, the bookkeeper Zhang Jinfa dispersed them, but the deceased suddenly collapsed, accusing him of stabbing him with scissors. He was then restrained by colleagues and taken to the police station. After translation, the presiding judge instructed the defendant to remain in custody for further questioning in seven days. Tang, the prosecutor, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the body had died from stab wounds inflicted before death. He then ordered the body to be handed over to Wang Chengfa, the factory owner of the deceased, with a guarantee.</p>

<p>Wu Yuying, a 17-year-old girl from Ningbo, of some beauty, lived at No. 91 Renshou Lane, Baker Road. On February 24th, at around 2:00 PM, Zhang A'gen (also known as Huiquan) and Qian Xiaoqiang (also known as Xiao Heitan), both 25 years old and neighbors from No. 63, took advantage of the fact that her father, Runzhi, was out and falsely claimed that her father was playing mahjong in room 24 of the Xi'an Hotel at No. 98 Xi'an Road. They said that he had lost all his money and wanted her to go there. The girl, unaware of their deceit, followed them to room 24 of the hotel, where she did not find her father. There, Zhang, Qian, and an unknown person closed the door, pushed her onto the bed, and forcibly violated her in turns. It was not until 9:00 PM that they released Yuying, who, fearful, returned home and dared not speak up. However, Zhang and Qian, not having satisfied their desires, secretly went to the Wu family's house at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday to lure Yuying to the hotel again for a secret rendezvous. When she refused, they hurled insults. Her father noticed this, and the two immediately fled. After questioning his daughter, he learned the truth and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Bai Mingfu and Zhang Yushan to arrest Zhang A'gen and Qian Xiaoqiang near Dalian Bay Road and Baker Road. They were taken to the police station and detained and were transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday. Because the case involved morals, the public was barred from attending the hearing. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>

Upon receiving the order, the Jiangsu Second Prison Branch in this city, in accordance with Proposal No. 85, which stated, "In areas where there is a Penitentiary, the training staff of the Penitentiary may concurrently serve as instructors; in areas without a Penitentiary, personnel from the local high-level Party headquarters may concurrently serve as instructors," sent a letter requesting the Municipal Party Headquarters to handle the matter. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Party Headquarters recognized the importance of training political prisoners and, through a standing committee, appointed education committee members.

<p>Subsequently, the meeting discussed the method of education and what form it should take. It was resolved to adopt an individual conversation approach. Regarding how political prisoners should be grouped, it was resolved to create a form, send it to various prisons for investigation, and group the prisoners based on their educational background and experience, with each group not exceeding ten people. Regarding how the educational outline should be defined, it was resolved that the educational outline would not be specifically defined, but the following principles would be used as the scope of education: (A) "Belief," (B) "Life," (C) "Politics," and (D) "Economics." The aim is to engage in conversations with each political prisoner and guide them towards the Three Principles of the People. Regarding determining the date for the commencement of education, it was resolved to decide after the investigation and grouping. Jiang Huaisu, Lu Jingshi, and Xing Wan were elected as standing committee members. The rest is omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau to Launch Shanghai-Caohejing Public Bus Route <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Purchasing Twelve New Buses from the United States; Officially Launching Service in Early July</p>
<p>The Shanghai Southern Public Bus Management Office of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to develop urban-rural transportation and facilitate travel for farmers, has decided to launch a public bus route from Shanghai to Caohejing, with official service to begin in early July. Twelve new buses have been purchased from the American Damon Company. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Designated Route</p>
<p>The route for the Shanghai to Caohejing public bus service has been finalized by the Shanghai Southern Public Bus Management Office. The starting station is Peace Road near the Old City Gate, and the ending station is the west side of Caohejing Town. The route passes through Zhaozhou Road, Xieqiao, Xiexu Road, Dazha Bay, Dapu Bridge, Jiji Bridge, turns into Xietu Road, passes through Xujiahui Town, Hongqiao, and reaches Caohejing Town. The roadbed paving project is being carried out by the Public Works Bureau and is expected to be completed and officially open for traffic in early July of this year.</p>
<p>Connecting Routes</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Caohejing route connects with various routes in the southern Shanghai area managed by the Management Office, such as Route 1 to Longhua, Route 3 to the Circular City Route, Route 4 to the Red Character Xiqiao and the Sixteenth Pier, and the Black Character Dapu Bridge, to the Xiaodongmen and Dadongtou Road routes. Passengers will not encounter difficulties when transferring to other routes. The fare for each stop on the route, as well as for the starting and ending stations, is currently being determined.</p>
<p>Purchasing New Buses</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Southern Public Bus Management Office took over the commercially operated bus company in the southern Shanghai area in the past, operations on all routes have flourished after the Management Office's dedicated reorganization. The Management Office is now launching a new route to Caohejing, so there are not enough vehicles to allocate. Therefore, twelve new buses have been ordered from the American Damon Company and have already been shipped to Shanghai. The Management Office has contracted with businesses for the construction of the bus bodies and other projects, which are expected to be completed by mid-June.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Ningbo Native Association Cables Request to Halt Grave Relocations in Ning Districts <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The relocation of graves in various Ning districts is being handled too hastily, causing public anxiety, especially in various villages of Yinxian County. The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai has repeatedly received reports from villagers requesting assistance. It has sent letters and telegrams requesting rectification, as previously reported. It has now been learned that although the relocation of graves in the urban and suburban areas of Yinxian County has been halted, there are rumors that it will continue in the rural areas. Fearing that different policies will lead to misunderstandings, they sent a telegram to the Yinxian County Government yesterday, stating: "We have received your telegram regarding the halt to grave relocations in the urban area of Yin County. We are comforted. According to news reports, you have recently submitted a document to the Special Commissioner's Office stating that the rural areas will continue to be implemented in order to avoid too many changes. Local governance is inconsistent with provincial orders and is not a fundamental solution, causing greater public anxiety. Urban and rural areas should be treated equally, and different policies are not appropriate. We request that you order all townships to immediately halt the relocation until officials, civilians, and merchants have agreed on an overall plan, which is then submitted to the province for approval, before proceeding to avoid further disturbances. Sincerely, Yu Hede and others from the Ningdu Native Association in Shanghai."</p>

<h3 id="e158">Scarce Pork Supply Leads to Price Increase Yesterday <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Association of this city, citing scarce supply and soaring prices, announced a uniform price increase starting yesterday, averaging four to six cents per pound. Their announcement stated: "Recently, representatives from various districts in the British, French, and American concessions, as well as the surrounding countryside, have repeatedly requested meetings, stating that the current supply of fresh pork is scarce, pork prices are rising daily, and the livelihood of those in the industry is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result, various shops have unanimously requested to close the market for several days in order to uniformly increase prices." In response, it has been verified that the requests are based on factual circumstances. However, closing the market is difficult to approve because we are in the midst of implementing the New Life Movement, and there are many memorial days this month, so how can we selfishly proceed in this way? Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has previously issued a notice to all industry associations in the city, prohibiting unwarranted business closures, which is on record. Therefore, this association convened representatives from all districts in the city on the 7th of this month. Representatives from the British, French, and American concessions, inside and outside the city walls, and from the surrounding countryside, including Fan Deyu, Sun Hongxiang, Chen Longhu, Rong Zhaogang, Wu Gengsheng, Yang Weibai, Yu Jinfu, Xu Jinsheng, Ye Shifan, Rong Qianchu, Gu Ziyun, Zai Jingfu, Huang Shuntang, Fang Yongchu, Huang Zhongqi, Yang Zhicheng, Song Yingui, Zhou Chengxiang, Wu Binglin, Ye Hengxian, Ye Hengshao, Shen Weifu, Gu Shaoqin, and others, a total of over seventy people, were present. The executive committee of this association earnestly dissuaded them from closing the market and immediately agreed to set a uniform market price. It is hoped that all members of the industry in the city will prioritize their livelihoods, protect their own capital, and not act carelessly. They should sell according to the prices agreed upon by the representatives in order to maintain a uniform price throughout the city. On the other hand, we hope you will kindly inform your customers and explain the various difficulties of this industry, hoping for their understanding. The agreed-upon prices are listed below. All prices are based on the market scale. Door sales: Trotters are 36 cents per pound, center cut is 38 cents per pound, ribs and leg are all 40 cents per pound, streaky pork is 34 cents per pound, lard is 32 cents per pound, boneless and skinless all lean meat is 52 cents per pound. Wholesale to taverns, noodle shops, restaurants, rice shops, and Cantonese businesses: leg and ribs are 2 catties 12 ounces per dollar, center cut and trotters are 3 catties, streaky pork and lard are 3 catties 4 ounces, all lean meat is 2 catties.</p>

The factory has 42,000 spindles and 1,100 looms, all of which are the 1935 model, so the goods are produced quickly and exquisitely. After the visit, factory director Ai Xihua hosted a luncheon before everyone dispersed.</p>

<p>The All-Zhejiang Association of this city held a standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at its clubhouse on Avenue Edward VII. More than twenty directors, including Chu Huiseng and Shen Junru, attended. The meeting was chaired by Chu Huiseng. First, Chairman Chu Huiseng reported on incoming documents, including: A telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that all counties be instructed to uniformly adopt the Chinese Oil Lamp Company's pressure oil lamps. This has been noted and handled. A letter from the Songyang Gushi Town Tobacco Industry Association, requesting that improved tobacco seeds be purchased on their behalf for planting. After the reporting matters were completed, the following motions were discussed: Motion from the Songyang Gushi Town Tobacco Industry Association requesting that improved tobacco seeds be purchased on their behalf. It was resolved that: (A) Sun Cui from the Huinong Company, Wu Wensheng, should quickly purchase the tobacco seeds and send them for transfer. (B) Reply to the Songyang Gushi Town Tobacco Industry Association. The provision in the Law on Labor Service for the People of Zhejiang Province requiring ten days of service hinders the livelihoods of coolies. Request that an amendment be proposed. It was resolved that a telegram should be sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government. (Other motions omitted.) The telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs is recorded below. To the Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association: We have received and noted your telegram. Pressure oil lamps have many advantages, and this Department is very willing to promote them to stop leaks. However, for such practical items, publicity with real objects is more effective. Your association should inform the company to set up sales offices throughout the province and display samples widely to stimulate people's interest in trying them. We hereby telegraphically reply, hoping you will take note and handle accordingly. Printed by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs.</p>

<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai is a famous fellow-provincial organization in Shanghai. This year, it is conducting its seventh recruitment of team leaders to discuss the implementation methods. Yesterday was the date for the first announcement of the recruitment results. A team leader meeting was held at the association's clubhouse on Avenue Haig. The overall team leader, Wang, and the chief of staff, Wang Yansong, were unable to attend due to important official business. The meeting was chaired by the chief of staff, Pei Yunqing. Although only more than 2,200 points (already paid) were raised this time, the team leaders who were not present called the association one after another to report on the fundraising work, which is progressing vigorously. Some even prepaid for fundraising points on the spot, and the situation was quite tense. It is said that the association's second unveiling will be on the 17th of this month, and excellent results are expected by then.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, We have seen a news item in your newspaper's local news column entitled "Judge's Persuasion Brings Couple Back Together." After reading it, we found that it differs greatly from the facts. According to the report, Xu Xueshan had an affair, abused and beat his wife, abandoned his young daughter, and forced her to return to her mother's home in Ningbo. None of this is true. It is all one-sided testimony from Xu Xiaomei. Xu Xiaomei's failure to live in her husband's home was her own decision. This time, Xu Xiaomei suddenly applied to the court for divorce mediation, but when she stated the purpose of her application in court, she suddenly changed her request to cohabitation, which is inconsistent. It is believed that discerning people can understand this without saying. Xu Xueshan's original intention was to have the couple cohabit and not divorce. Therefore, our lawyer, representing Xu Xueshan, stated in court that the couple should cohabit, and that Xu Xiaomei's failure to live in her husband's home was her own decision, so there was no need to apply for mediation. Now that she wants to cohabit, it should not be a problem. This is the actual situation. We are afraid that there may be some misunderstanding, so we hereby write to your chief editor to check and make corrections. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhu Yunhui, May 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Old Zhoushan Person Tours New Dinghai <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Tingchen</p>
<p>The Zhoushan Islands, isolated overseas east of Zhejiang, the county seat of Dinghai, located on one of the larger islands in the archipelago, is mountainous with little farmland. The rice produced is insufficient to feed the populace for even one season. A small number of wealthy individuals in the city and countryside can afford to eat rice and wear silk, but the majority subsist on buckwheat, vegetable fiber, and other coarse grains. Only the vicinity of the suburbs and the mountain valleys have a small amount of fertile land. Residents are compelled to compete with the mountains for soil, often piling up layers of rocks against the mountain cliffs to create terraced fields to supplement cultivation. However, these yield crops when there is adequate water, but are fruitless in drought. Further up, they cultivate wheat, barley, sweet potatoes, and corn. Still higher, they plant pines, cypresses, and other miscellaneous trees. Those areas unsuitable for trees are left to grow shrubs and wild grasses, providing firewood for cooking. Looking out, the mountain colors are lush and verdant, refreshing the eyes and broadening the mind, as the wilderness expands. Islanders along the coast mostly rely on fishing and salt production for a living. The elderly, weak, women, and children draw seawater, filter it to clarify it, and then sun-dry the brine to make salt, which is then sold to the salt bureau. The strong and able travel overseas by boat to catch sea fish, toiling their entire lives just to make ends meet. Driven by hunger and cold, many residents have no choice but to go north to Hunan or south to Yue (Guangdong and Guangxi), and some even venture to foreign lands, selling their labor and enduring inhumane lives in exchange for meager profits. This has been the general and pervasive state of the livelihood of Dinghai residents in the past. During this trip back to my hometown, although I did not traverse the entire county, I only took a look at the urban and suburban areas and found that many old aspects have changed, refreshing my eyes and ears. I will now record what I have seen and heard, to serve as filler for this newspaper, and to elicit a smile from the readers.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Dinghai, but have lived elsewhere for over thirty years. Initially, I would return once a year, but now it has been over ten years since I last set foot in my hometown. This time, I accompanied relatives to bring the coffin of Mr. He back for burial, so on the twenty-second of last month, I and my family boarded the Chuanshan steamship, set sail in the evening, and accompanied by Mr. He’s brothers, nephews, and uncle, and my old friend Mr. Zhang Shaogeng. We received preferential treatment from the ship's staff, and the journey was not lonely as we chatted with each other. Mr. Zhang, who has lived in Shenjiamen for generations, is especially knowledgeable about seafood. According to him, at its peak, Dinghai's fishing industry had over 20,000 fishing boats, generating over 8 million yuan in revenue annually. Subsequently, due to the weak purchasing power of the Chinese people, coupled with foreign encroachment, the industry gradually declined over the years. In the past two years, Shanghai and Ningbo financial institutions have tightened credit and are unwilling to recklessly issue loans, resulting in fishing boats remaining idle, unable to set sail for fishing. Shanghai and Ningbo gentry and merchants have repeatedly telegraphed officials in Beijing and Hangzhou to appeal, but no substantive solutions have been forthcoming. This has been reported in the Shenbao. The fishing season has arrived again this year, and the boat owners, compelled by circumstances, have sought other means, scraping together funds from various sources just to barely get out to sea. Therefore, it is foreseeable that their performance will be poor, he said. By morning, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle, with only slight tremors on the Tongsha sea. After a night of peaceful sleep, the ship arrived at Chuanshan Pier at six o'clock. After a brief stop, passengers and cargo were unloaded, and the ship weighed anchor and set sail. At seven-thirty, we arrived at Zhoushan Pier, amidst the clamor of firecrackers, as Mr. He's relatives and friends had been waiting at the pier for the arrival of the coffin. After raising the coffin and temporarily housing the spirit, we took rickshaws from Datoutou towards the South Gate. Dinghai, being located in a remote coastal region, has historically been plagued by pirates. The officials and merchants of the county mostly do not advocate demolishing the city walls. Only after the outer city wall of the South Gate was demolished did we have breakfast at a relative's house. Subsequently, accompanied by Mr. Sun Liqing and his brothers, we visited Dinghai Park. The park is located at the foot of Suoshan Mountain in the west of the city and was rebuilt from the old garrison headquarters, covering an area of over twenty mu. Dinghai Middle School and Dinghai Hospital are also located there. The main hall of the park is the Chengren Shrine, dedicated to the Ming Dynasty Prince Lu and his officials, national heroes who resisted the Qing army. To the side of the shrine gate is a palace well, the site where Prince Lu's consort died for her cause. Next to the well stands a stone stele, engraved with an account of the event. Further inside is a small hall, the four walls covered with hanging scrolls and horizontal inscriptions, recording anecdotes of loyal officials and righteous men of the late Ming Dynasty. Reading them evokes respect and a sense of national consciousness. The aforementioned stone stele, calligraphy, and paintings are all the work of Liqing, a licentiate. When Mr. Huang Renzhi passed through Dinghai, he praised them highly and subsequently established a literary friendship with Mr. Sun before departing. After the visit, we returned to the relative's house for lunch. After a brief rest, we went to Wuyang Mountain in the eastern suburbs to pay respects at my late father's grave. We sat down on the tombstone and chatted with the villagers about agricultural matters. According to them, in recent years, after a year of hard work, they can only scrape together a few dozen yuan in paper money. After household expenses, even one yuan is insufficient. Some even resort to borrowing money at high interest rates. Reflecting on their words, it is clear evidence of agricultural bankruptcy, but the villagers are simple and honest and do not know of such a term. We slowly entered the city and lodged at a relative's house. That day, I was extremely tired, and after dinner, I fell soundly asleep.</p>
<p>Dinghai's construction endeavors have shown improvement since the National Revolutionary Army unified the North and South and Zhejiang had started to show signs of progress. Currently, only running water is yet to be constructed due to the scale of the project. Residents use rainwater and well water for drinking and washing. Otherwise, it can be said that everything is more or less available, albeit on a small scale. Parks, hospitals, and middle schools have already been mentioned. Elementary schools for both boys and girls are scattered around the urban area, and the school buildings are quite presentable. Near the city suburbs, literacy schools have been established in temples to teach those in the countryside who are illiterate. The local newspaper is only the Zhoubao, but unfortunately, I did not go inside to visit, so I do not know its contents in detail. For fire protection, new-style foreign water carts have been purchased and fire brigades have been established in different districts to prevent fires. Due to the lack of running water, large Taiping water tanks are placed in wide areas along the roadside walls, to be used for suction by the fire hoses. However, the water pressure is insufficient and the effectiveness is weak, as evidenced by the fire at the home of a Mr. in Libei on the night of the twenty-fifth, where, despite all efforts to put out the fire, it still spread to over twenty houses. Dinghai, being an island county, previously did not have a telegraph line due to various reasons, so news was not readily available. Since the installation of wireless telegraph communication, official affairs from Beijing and Hangzhou and important news from Shanghai are known on the same day. Telephones and electric lights are common in both urban and rural areas, so news is readily available and the place is brightly lit. However, electric lights are only available at night. Mr. Ma Zukang of the electric company, because Mr. He was involved in initiating the company, had a decorative archway made of electric lights erected at the company's entrance on the day of his funeral, with special daytime electricity provided for decoration. As for the streets, the middle section has been repaved with stone strips, and the sides are connected with cement, but there are no sidewalks. However, because there are no cars, the width and pressure are sufficient to support it. The Tangjiapeng Road and Model Road inside and outside the South Gate are particularly good. The old bridges were all made of stone steps. Now, to facilitate the passage of rickshaws and bicycles, all the bridges in the city and suburbs have been rebuilt as flat bridges to facilitate traffic, but the bridges in the distant suburbs still have stone steps. When a rickshaw reaches the bridge, passengers must get out and wait for the rickshaw to cross the bridge before they can get back on. This is very inconvenient for travelers. In addition, passengers' sleeves are easily scratched by the body of the rickshaw. The cushions are not thick enough, and the springs are uneven, making them uncomfortable for the passengers' buttocks. The rickshaw pullers also need to be trained. The streets in the city are still wide, so there is no danger in driving. Outside the city, the roads become narrower, but the rickshaw pullers bury their heads and rush forward, causing the rickshaw to jolt, lightly injuring the buttocks and even overturning the rickshaw, which is detrimental to both the puller and the passenger. This is something that those in charge of road administration and rickshaw management should pay close attention to. Dinghai is mountainous, and one must often pass through one or two mountain passes to reach a township, which the locals call "crossing the pass." Rickshaws are definitely not suitable for long-distance travel. One must switch to a "sliding chair," as the locals call it. This is the old mode of transportation in Dinghai. The sedan chair bearers are very experienced, so they can safely navigate steep cliffs and dangerous precipices. Water transportation is all by steamship. There are small steamers going to Chuanshan, Zhenhai, Ningbo, Putuo, Daishan, Shenjiamen, and other places every day, and there are direct steamers to Shanghai in the north and Haimen, Wenzhou, and Ruian in the south of the province. The people of this county travel all over the world, which is no doubt due to the convenience of the sea routes.</p>
<p>In the financial sector, banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Commercial Bank all have small-scale Western-style buildings in Dinghai, establishing branches to absorb deposits and facilitate remittances. Other shops selling foreign goods, groceries, silk fabrics, and cloth are extremely dazzling in order to attract customers, but there is no night market or neon lights. Other shops are roughly similar to those in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and they are all languishing. As a result, money flows from the countryside to the city, then from the city to the metropolis, and finally from the metropolis to the industrialized countries. It is truly lamentable to speak of this.</p>
<p>The old public institutions included the Dinghai Subprefecture Office, the garrison headquarters, and the new and old academies. Now, the subprefecture office has been converted into the county government, the garrison headquarters has been converted into Dinghai Park, and the academies have been converted into schools. New institutions include the Dinghai District Court and the County Public Security Bureau. There are fifty to sixty police officers on the city's main streets to maintain order and investigate theft. However, due to insufficient funding, they have been merged into the county government and managed by the Public Security Section. The police uniforms are still quite neat. Slogans of the New Life Movement are hung everywhere on wooden signs. The county government has designated poster boards, scattered in important locations in the city and suburbs, so the corners of walls and roofs are kept clean, suggesting the diligence of the cleaning campaign.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is now a province where opium has been eradicated, so no opium dens or places for indulging in such vices have been found inside or outside Dinghai city. Gambling is naturally prohibited in public places, but occasional games of mahjong in private homes are not forbidden. Currently, the only problem is public security. The county residents mostly go out to engage in industry and commerce, while people from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and northern Jiangsu flock to live there. It is undeniable that these people are of mixed character. The city streets are safe because of the police, but life in the countryside is difficult, and when people have nothing to eat, they inevitably resort to desperate measures. Robberies and kidnappings occur from time to time, so most villagers with some wealth move to the city for safety. This is a matter that the local authorities must consider in terms of security measures. Dinghai is connected to Japan in the east, to the South Seas in the south, and is the key point of the Qiantang River and the Yangtze River in the northwest. In theory, it should be a national defense fortress, but the country's affairs are numerous and complex, so this is not yet under consideration.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth, we escorted the coffin to Xiaoyan Mountain. It rained that day. Although we took rickshaws, we could not cross the Jiong Bridge, so we had to walk. The small paths between the paddy fields were muddy and slippery, so we had to be careful. On the twenty-fifth, I took a boat to Baiquan Township to visit the elders of my maternal family. When I got off the sedan chair, I felt like a stranger who had not changed his accent. When I entered the hall to pay respects, I learned that my eighty-year-old maternal uncle and seventy-year-old maternal aunt had passed away last summer and winter. At the time, I felt regretful that I had not been notified sooner and could not attend their funerals in person. When I saw their remains, I was overcome with sadness, so seeing my cousins filled me with new feelings. On the twenty-sixth, I went to Xiaoyang'ao to pay respects at the ancestral tombs and ancestral shrine. I talked with the villagers again and again and found that they were struggling to make a living. Dinghai County only produces grain, seafood, and salt, which is far from enough to offset the cost of imported goods. If a village becomes a county, a county becomes a province, and a province becomes a country, and a village, a county, and a province all run trade deficits, how can the people not be poor and the country not be weak? Economic aggression, nibbling away at the rice, reaches us living in the cities. How can we not be disheartened when we think of this?</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Purpose and Hope of Participating in the Olympic Games: Li Huitang, Sent from Hong Kong on May 5th <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>In addition to participating in the World Olympic Games, our national football team will first travel to Java and other places in Southeast Asia to play more than 20 matches. After the Olympic Games, they will travel to various countries to compete. This is an unprecedented undertaking in Chinese football and sports. Football is arguably the most developed sport in our country, so the team's travels and competition details will surely attract the attention of the Chinese people. Mr. Li Huitang, the captain of the Chinese football team, has specially written about his life and competitions along the way in Europe, which will continue to be published in this newspaper. Readers are encouraged to pay attention. First, we have recorded Mr. Li's article "The Purpose and Hope of Participating in the Olympic Games" on the left. (Editor)</p>
<p>This time, the football team is participating in the Summer Olympic Games, and many people who care for us deeply but do not understand the overall situation will invariably hold the same extravagant hope, expecting this group of athletes to bring home the world championship title from the arena of fierce competition in their very first participation. While this is theoretically possible, it is not yet the right time to hope for it. Given the current situation, it is akin to asking us to carry Mount Tai and cross the North Sea. This is not about underestimating ourselves. In fact, in terms of our innate physique, comfortable living, training methods, technical level, and the enthusiasm with which the nation and society promote it, we are not even close to being on par with others.</p>
<p>There are also some people who believe that we are already struggling to compete with the foreigners residing in China, so going to the world football stage would be like a small sorcerer meeting a great one. In today's situation of national crisis and economic hardship, it is not right to waste a huge amount of travel expenses just to embarrass ourselves in front of foreigners. This argument seems to have some valid points at first glance, but if we are already aware of our own immaturity, we should not be complacent and self-satisfied, but should find opportunities to improve. We should not sit idle at home, refusing to eat because of fear of choking, and remain stagnant. Moreover, if our country is to participate in the Olympic Games, football is the most technically impressive sport, which can refresh the foreigners' perspective. Therefore, advocating against sending a team seems to be a narrow view from a well.</p>
<p>As I have repeatedly said, our purpose this time is not to seek a championship. We only know to focus our entire spirit on "effort," bringing out all our true skills and strength without reservation. Our aim is to give foreigners a good impression of us. Our purpose is not limited to participating in the Olympic Games in Berlin. After the Olympic Games, we also want to travel to other countries to learn from them. We want to carefully observe and study their strengths, such as techniques, training methods, and changes in formation, using all our ingenuity to try to understand their subtle points, and to seek knowledge and progress with the excitement of an elementary school student. We want to treat ourselves as a piece of raw iron to be forged, becoming more useful with each strike, so that we will not have made this trip in vain.</p>
<p>Our hope this time is to be able to present our country's thousands of years of Eastern culture and the youthful spirit of the new era at the Summer Olympic Games, where the eyes and ears of the world are gathered, washing away the foreigners' negative perception of China as the "sick man of the East." More importantly, after we return home, we want to use the new knowledge and teaching materials we have absorbed during this long journey to influence the football community in our country by setting an example. We hope to impart the new skills we have learned into the minds of the younger generation. If we are to give up our playing careers, we will also use our identity and qualifications as coaches to guide the younger generation, so that football in our country can make overall and widespread progress, raising the current level to the world standard, so that we will not have made this trip in vain.</p>
<p>At the banquet of the Lixingshe in the capital, the presidents, ministers, and officials expressed their fervent expectations of us, summarized in the eight words "strive to observe" and "adopt strengths and discard weaknesses." This reasonable expectation makes us feel the greatness of our mission and the weight of our responsibility, and we dare not be lazy or neglectful. In my own reply, I also said that what our sports community needs now is not just a few dozen or a few hundred excellent players. Fundamentally speaking, there are very few outstanding individuals among China's 400 million people. The elite selected from 400 million people can sometimes not even defeat a battalion of foreign soldiers. Even if they win, there is not much glory in it. This is because in recent years, we have only achieved a distorted development, and we have not done any practical work in the widespread aspects. How can we blame it? Therefore, what we feel we need is the universal progress of the whole country, to make all 400 million compatriots athletic and to understand the fundamental meaning of sports. At that time, why worry that China will suffer foreign aggression?</p>
<p>In short, in addition to the responsibilities of striving to observe and strive to express Eastern civilization during this trip abroad to participate in the Olympic Games, the greatest and most important work lies in the future after returning home.</p>

<p>Yuehan, Shen, and Liu Break the Pole Vault Record</p>
<p>Today Is Purely for Ball Games; Closing Ceremony This Afternoon</p>
<p>The 9th Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private School Joint Athletic Meet was the second day yesterday, and it continued at Shanghai College Middle School in the afternoon. All the track and field events were completed yesterday. As a result, Jinling won the championship with 78 points, and Yuehan, the champion of the previous competition, was the runner-up with 56 points. The bubble cup, donated by the Bubble Essence Company last year, stipulates that the first to win three times will be able to keep it permanently. The previous cup was won by Yuehan, but this year it was transferred to Jinling for safekeeping. The scores of this competition were not outstanding, as there was a torrential rain the night before, and although the sun appeared yesterday afternoon, the field was still very muddy, which greatly affected the scores. However, in the pole vault, Yuehan’s Shen Jisi and Liu Zhongxiang broke the highest record of the conference by clearing 3.02 meters simultaneously over Li Cui’s (from Soochow) record of 2.89 meters, which was commendable. Yesterday's ball game, volleyball, was also moved to the gym. Due to venue conditions, tennis was postponed across the board. Today's order of events belongs to ball games, and the situation is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e182">Chu Minyi Suggests Increasing the Number of Chinese Martial Arts Athletes for the Olympic Games <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Member of the Central Committee Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing. When a reporter asked him about the news of our country's participation in the Olympic Games, he said that he is a member of the National Selection and Weightlifting Selection Committee, scheduled to be held at Shen Garden in Shanghai on the morning of the 11th of this month. The national martial arts athletes' preliminary selection has been telegraphed to the Director of the Central Martial Arts Hall, Zhang Zhijiang, and the Dean of the Examination Yuan, Dai Jitao, to come to Shanghai to preside over the selection. He believes that Chinese martial arts has many categories, and the quota of only six athletes for the Olympic Games is not enough to represent the entire martial arts community. Therefore, he has telegraphed Mr. Zhang Zhijiang to request the Dean to consider increasing the number of martial arts athletes so that our country's various martial arts can be fully displayed before the people of the world. Whether we can win honor is a matter of opportunity, but this opportunity should not be missed.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The French Boxer Indemnity Funds for Sino-French Education and Charity <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The French return of the Boxer Indemnity funds began with the exchange of notes between China and France in June of the eleventh year of the Republic of China. An agreement between China and France was reached in April of the fourteenth year, stipulating that a certain amount of US dollar bonds from the Boxer Indemnity would be used annually as subsidies for Sino-French education and charity. A Sino-French Education Fund Committee was jointly established by both parties in April of the fourteenth year as an independent entity. (The current Chinese delegation includes Li Shuhua, Liu Xichang, Chen Jianxiao, Luo Jialun, Li Yuying, Zou Lu, Shen Yinmo, Zhang Gongquan, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Yongming, and Liu Fucheng, among others. The French delegation includes Wei Lide, He Bo, Zhu Hande, and Baertake.) A Fund Management Committee was organized within the committee (currently including Bar, Masu, Handerwei, Zhang Gongquan, and Zhou Zuomin), with members planning and preparing. Although the current accumulated funds are small, if the unpaid portion of the French Boxer Indemnity interest-free bonds is entrusted to the committee for safekeeping, the face value would be 175.8 million francs, a significant amount, and development would be substantial. Recently, the fund committee established five special representatives (including Zhang Gongquan) to handle special affairs and negotiate with the Chinese and French governments on the Sino-French Education Fund issue. The Sino-French Education Fund Committee's activities include self-operated projects and subsidies to other organizations, focusing on education and culture, mainly in the following areas: A. Completing the only educational institution between China and France, the most important of which is the Sino-French University. B. Subsidizing effective Sino-French academic institutions or schools at home and abroad, such as the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, the Lyon Sino-French Institute, Aurora University in Shanghai, the Sino-French National College, and the Tianjin Industry and Commerce College, which receive annual subsidies. C. In accordance with the Sino-French refund agreement, funds allocated for Sino-French education are also used for Sino-French charitable purposes. Therefore, current recipients of the committee's subsidies include Sino-French hospitals in Beiping, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guiyang, and Longzhou. D. Subsidizing students studying in France, limited to those who have entered the school and achieved excellent results as certified by the school. Currently, the committee subsidizes 11 students with full scholarships, 4 students with partial or small scholarships, and 2 students with special research grants. In addition, one graduate of the French Department of Peking University is specially awarded a scholarship to study in France each year. As of the end of last year, 4 students have been selected. E. The committee also cooperates with other organizations or Boxer Indemnity agencies to subsidize other cultural undertakings, including: 1. Subsidizing the construction of a vault for the Palace Museum; 2. Subsidizing the construction of the Lu Mo Ke Hall in the garden of the Natural History Museum for the research laboratories and specimen rooms of the Beiping Research Institute's physiology, zoology, and botany departments; 3. Subsidizing the National Beiping Library's purchase of useful French books and exchanging librarians with the Paris Library; 4. Subsidizing the Ministry of Education's National Language Unification Committee to compile a Sino-French dictionary; 5. Subsidizing the Construction Committee's dispatch of personnel to France for practical study; 6. Subsidizing Dr. Zhao Chengzhang's research on Chinese medicine; 7. Subsidizing the Radium Research Institute, etc. C. Establishing the Sino-French Cultural Exchange and Publication Committee (members include Shen Yinmo, Li Yuying, Li Shuhua, Liu Xichang, and Duo Ermeng). This committee is the only self-operated project of the Sino-French Education Fund Committee. The purpose of establishing this committee is to mutually translate and publish works so that the academic thoughts of the two countries can be effectively communicated and a plan for exchanging publications can be formulated and implemented systematically. In addition, inviting famous French scholars such as Bo Xihe, La Luo, Fa Ye, and Heber to give lectures in China is also one of the Sino-French cultural affairs handled by the committee. As for participating in the construction of a dormitory for Chinese students studying in France in the University Village in Paris, it is only being planned and implemented by the committee, as the funding has not yet been fully realized. The total amount of the Boxer Indemnity returned is 391,581,529 francs and 050 centimes, which is equivalent to US$75,556,964.457, based on the exchange rate of one US dollar for 5.1826 francs. The funds are gradually advanced and lent to the Sino-French Industrial Bank as the fund for the bank to issue 5% US dollar bonds. The purpose is to: 1. Exchange for interest-free bonds held by foreign creditors; 2. Handle Sino-French education and charity; 3. Pay off the remaining unpaid capital owed by the Chinese government; 4. Allocate funds to repay various debts owed by the Chinese government to the bank. Regarding the second item, at least US$200,000 to US$250,000 is allocated each year. It is reported that the distribution method is to leave a small portion as a fund and use almost all of it for Sino-French education, culture, and charity. The fixed income each year after that will be US$250,000, and the amount of unfixed income will vary each year until the year 36 of the Republic of China, when the debt will be fully repaid.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan Chen Cipuo Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Talks About Japanese Education Being on Track</p>
<p>Will Visit Education Minister Wang in Beijing Tomorrow to Report</p>
<p>Chen Cipuo, the supervisor of the Office of Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 3:00 PM yesterday after being recalled to China by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education. He immediately retired to a hotel to rest and will go to Beijing on the 10th to visit Minister Wang, report on the current situation of students studying in Japan and the affairs of the office, and request instructions on future directions. He will stay in the country for about a month before returning to his post. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Supervisor Chen at the hotel. The following is a record of the conversation about the current situation of students studying in Japan and recent political developments in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese Education is on Track</p>
<p>Mr. Chen first stated that he was dispatched to manage affairs related to studying in Japan last August and it will soon be nine months. This time, he was ordered to return to the country to report and will not stay in Shanghai for long before going to Beijing to visit Minister Wang and report on everything. Since his arrival, with the concerted efforts of his colleagues, hard work, and the guidance and assistance of various parties at home and abroad, Japanese education has been put on track. This is something that can be reported to the people of the country with comfort. However, active work still awaits future efforts, so he will make some requests when he visits the Minister of Education this time to be able to follow them.</p>
<p>Hope that Japan will not Indiscriminately Accept Students</p>
<p>Mr. Chen continued, "When I was in Japan, in order to ensure that Chinese students studying in Japan could enrich their academic abilities under strict education and training so that they could serve the country in the future, I specifically visited important members of the Japanese Ministry of Education and the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the authorities of various universities, hoping that the Japanese education authorities would not indiscriminately accept Chinese students. For Chinese students, this would not only prevent them from gaining practical benefits and cause them great losses, but also greatly affect the credibility of Japanese schools. Therefore, the Japanese education authorities have been able to understand our country's painstaking efforts to ensure the practical learning of students studying abroad and have agreed to help correct the past malpractices. This is indeed something that can be reported to the people of the country with comfort."</p>
<p>Unified Introduction Has Been Recognized by Japan</p>
<p>Mr. Chen further stated that the Office of Supervisor is now responsible for the unified introduction of students to schools. Japanese schools have refused to admit students who do not have an introduction letter from the Office of Supervisor. At the same time, the Office of Supervisor not only detains the documents of those who forge documents but also escorts them back to the country. Even if the authorities of domestic schools obtain certificates through personal relationships and deceive their way into identification, their student status must be revoked once verified. Currently, there are approximately 5,000 students registered with the Office of Supervisor in Japan.</p>
<p>Hope that Students Will Not Try to Be Lucky</p>
<p>In the past, among students studying abroad, there were often those who were not familiar with Japanese, or even those who had never been to Japan but only entrusted friends in Japan to register. This situation is certainly not right. Now, the Office of Supervisor will not issue an introduction letter to students studying in Japan without verifying their photos and conducting a serious assessment. However, the general students in the country often still do not understand the government's intention to rectify the study abroad business and go abroad casually, which causes them great losses. This malpractice is mostly due to students' lack of legal spirit and their neglect of practical learning. In the future, students should absolutely correct this wrong notion and think about their own studies and the future of the country and nation. However, it is still hoped that the press can convey this information at any time and arouse the attention of all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Zhejiang University Establishes Publicly Funded Students <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the 25th Year, the Quota is 5%</p>
<p>Since the new president of Zhejiang University, Zhu Kezhen, took office, he has appointed deans, reorganized equipment, and the entire school has been refreshed. Under the guidance of the new president, students have been able to focus on their studies, and the school, which had been in turmoil for half a year, has gradually returned to normal. President Zhu, in view of the depletion of the social economy and the pity of the poor and out-of-school children, has decided to establish publicly funded student quotas from the second half of the year. Those who are admitted will be completely free of charge, so that children from poor families will have the opportunity to receive higher education. In his first speech to the students after taking office, Zhu repeatedly stated the importance of publicly funded students. In the past, under the imperial examination system, children from poor families could still strive to study hard and achieve success, but today, higher education is almost exclusively enjoyed by children from middle-class families and above. It is already very difficult for middle-class families to provide their children with high school education, and as for university students, 300 to 400 yuan per year is not enough. Even in Jiangsu, which is the most prosperous province in the country, according to statistics, 66% of residents have an annual income of less than 90 yuan. Zhejiang may not be as good as this number, so children who cannot enjoy higher education due to economic reasons actually account for more than 99% of the total population. It is very regrettable to bury talents. Now that the university has established this publicly funded student system, it is of great significance to society. It is reported that the plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for review and implementation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for the National Zhejiang University to Recruit Publicly Funded Students: 1. Applicants for publicly funded students must have a certificate from the graduating school to prove that their families are indeed impoverished and cannot afford university education expenses. 2. The ranking of the students who apply for publicly funded students must be within one-sixth of all admitted students in order to be admitted (for example, if the total number of admitted students is 60, the ranking of publicly funded students must be within the top 10). 3. Applicants for publicly funded students who fail cannot be admitted as ordinary fee-paying students. 4. The quota for publicly funded students at all levels shall not exceed 5% of the number of students at that level. 5. Students who pass the examination for publicly funded students will be given a subsidy of 250 yuan per year by the school, divided into two installments, which will be paid at the beginning of each semester, but all fees that should be paid according to school regulations will be deducted from this subsidy. 6. Those whose average grade point average in the semester is below one-third of the best students in the same grade of their college will have their publicly funded student status revoked. 7. The period for which publicly funded students receive subsidies shall not exceed four years.</p>

It has been learned that Mr. Weng has replied to the letter agreeing. It is learned that Mr. Weng has received another letter from the association, stating that the House of Lords in London has discussed the issue of calendar reform and that the plan to divide the year into 13 months is opposed by the general public in the UK. As for the issue of submitting the calendar reform proposal to the League of Nations in Geneva for discussion, the British government will express its willingness to support and explore it.

<h3 id="e208">Securities: Bond Market Sees Both Ups and Downs <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Classes A and D Fall, While Classes B, C, and E Rise. Today is National Humiliation Memorial Day - Market Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced a fluctuating market, initially falling before rising, and ultimately settling halfway. It was evident that the upward momentum was somewhat weak, creating a fleeting situation. This type of situation has occurred repeatedly. By analogy, the upward momentum is in a dilemma. Looking ahead, the upward momentum is difficult to stop, but it is very easy to decline. The environment is also complex. There are rumors in Fujian and South China. Smuggling cannot be stopped and is expanding. Optimistic factors in the market price are still in the minority. Yesterday was very uncertain. At the opening in the morning, there was strong selling pressure. Numbers 35, 46, 47, and 72 were all sold. Although numbers 11 and 20 were bought, the supply and demand on the table were very unbalanced. Market prices fell across the board, with Class D falling by as much as four and a half points. This type of government bond is not related to the previous old bonds, so its rise and fall often create its own trend. Other types fell slightly by 5, 10, to 25 points.</p>
<p>At the opening in the afternoon, the trend suddenly changed. Numbers 10, 11, and 47 saw significant buying interest. Number 4 also absorbed some. Market prices rose sharply again. Class E forward contracts rose by 55 points, and the rest rose uniformly by 30 to 50 points. The closing was stable, and the market prices saw both ups and downs. Classes E, C, and B all rose by 5, 10, to 25 points, while Classes A and D fell by only 5 to 35 points. The market situation was chaotic, and the trend was uncertain. There may be changes in the future. The total transaction volume was 5,715,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). Also, today is National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the market is closed.</p>

<p>Near and Far Futures Both Break Below the 200 Yuan Mark. Although the Bulls Briefly Maintain, They Ultimately Prove Unable to Sustain the Effort Alone</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation was extremely chaotic. The day before saw a drop of three yuan. Due to the pursuit of gold relations, a large number of forced liquidations suddenly occurred, with a particularly large amount. In the second session, there was a sudden sharp decline, with the decline in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth month futures all falling below the 200 yuan mark. In the afternoon, a certain party made strenuous efforts to struggle, dragging in additional capital. In the second session, the last three months returned to above the 200 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Each Month Falls by About 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, near-month futures were flat and weak, falling by 20 to 30 points. When the auction reached far-month futures, the drop of three yuan the day before triggered profit-takers to buy back, rising by 20 to 30 points. It was reported that in the second session of the auction, a large number of cotton bulls emerged, and the new October cotton broke below the 40 yuan mark. The market situation changed rapidly, and selling pressure suddenly intensified. The chips on the table were extremely loose and indiscriminate, and panic reached its peak. Each month fell sharply by 2.34 yuan, all falling below the 200 yuan mark. The closing trend was still poor, and the result was that each month fell by 1.6, 7, 8, 9 points to 2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>At the opening in the afternoon, the selling pressure on near-month futures intensified. When the auction reached far-month futures, a certain giant came again to buy and add capital, and the market price turned upward. The eighth, ninth, and tenth month futures returned to above the 200 yuan mark. By the time of closing, it had entered a state of fatigue again. The result was that each month rose by 1, 2, 3, or 4 points compared to the closing price of the previous day. 5,850 bales were sold from Changfeng, 1,200 bales from Taichang, 1,650 bales from Xincheng, 1,450 bales from Xiecheng, 3,400 bales from Gengfeng, 3,550 bales from Hexing, 1,100 bales from Mingde, 1,000 bales from Yiji, and 1,900 bales from Hengyi. 2,150 bales were bought from Renfeng, 1,750 bales from Shenji, 1,900 bales from Ruidai, 2,150 bales from Shenchang, 1,600 bales from Dafeng, 1,550 bales from Yudai, 1,000 bales from Zhendai, 700 bales from Tonghe, and 800 bales from Yichang, and 750 bales from Tongji.

<p>The cotton market is extremely weak, and the decline is particularly severe. This is because the yarn market is weak, rumors are rife in the market, and people's minds are chaotic. Gold merchants are painfully liquidating positions. The market fell in a straight line, with each month breaking through the three-yuan mark. In the afternoon, a certain giant came to absorb the selling, and the market rose again. The closing entered a state of fatigue again.</p>
<p>New Cotton Enters the 40 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, the market sentiment was still flat because the US cotton market was calm and firm, rising by 2 to 11 points, Indian cotton saw mixed gains and losses, fluctuating by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, and Osaka Three-Article Cotton rose by 20 to 30 points. When the auction reached the August futures, it suddenly fell by 15 points. The new October cotton fell sharply, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, in the second session of the auction, a large number of gold merchants suddenly liquidated positions. The market fell in a straight line, the selling was deafening, and each month broke through the three-yuan mark. The panic was extreme. The result was that each month fell by 70 to 85 points compared to the closing price of the previous day. The momentum stabilized at the opening in the afternoon. Due to profit-takers buying back and a certain party making efforts to buy, the market situation slightly improved. By the third session of closing, the market had entered a state of fatigue again. The result was that each month rose by 5 to 15 points compared to the closing price in the morning.

<p>The consumption of current cotton is sluggish, the factories are not opening, and the source is 300 bales of Yao cotton and 200 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Demand for Both New and Old American Cotton <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>Since the Shanghai tea warehouses announced the opening of foreign exchange, the Tunxi new tea market has been very active. In addition, the road warehouses and merchants, because black tea has been assigned to government sales, are becoming increasingly competitive. In recent days, the brands have accepted warehouse funds of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

The selling price of new tea has risen sharply from 70 yuan to 82 yuan for high-quality tea, and from 57-58 yuan to 65-66 yuan for ordinary goods.

<p>Large Firms Buy Near-Month Contracts: The Result is Still a Decline</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month initially rose, then became weak, and finally stabilized. The quoted price for foreign wheat fell by 0.1 yuan in Chicago and 0.2 yuan in Canada. At the opening, due to the aftershocks of the rebound the previous day, people's minds were still excited, and the opening prices for each month rose by 10-20 points. Transactions were also still active. However, by the second session, due to rumors in the market that a cotton and iron loan had been successfully obtained, the selling pressure increased again, and the floaters also took the opportunity to release their positions, causing near- and far-month prices to fall by 20-30 points again.</p>
<p>Until the opening in the afternoon, the morale was initially low. The opening price for the June contract was 3.035 yuan, and the far-month futures also continued to fall by more than one point. However, below the second session, because large firms still bought the June contract, the momentum was quite strong. It was said that it was related to finance, so the opening prices gradually improved, and the June contract reversed and rose by more than 20 points. The rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>Currently, the situation is because June is the transition between old and new crops, and large firms are holding on to their positions. It is feared that there will be many changes in the future.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices for each month initially rose, then returned, and then became flat and weak. The quoted price for foreign wheat fell slightly by 0.2 yuan. At the opening, due to the impact of the rebound the previous day, the opening prices were very firm, with the June contract reaching 4.03 yuan and the July contract reaching 2.09 yuan, an increase of 80 points to 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Then, due to the decline in the flour market, morale also weakened, and the opening prices gradually softened, falling by 30 to 50 points from the initial opening.</p>
<p>Until the opening in the afternoon, because the weather had cleared and selling pressure increased again, the prices for each month continued to weaken, reversing and falling by 20 to 30 points from the previous day. Currently, because of speculative competition, the market will be difficult to stabilize, because large non-industry firms have entered the market. The current wheat is being dragged down by the futures market by 5 points. 2,200 bales of Fuxin Fuche wheat were sold in the city for a price of 5.0335 yuan.</p>
<p>The US wheat is forecast to continue to receive rain, and the foreign market is slightly looser. Canadian wheat exports are slightly weaker. The government's estimate is scheduled to be released next Monday.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only twenty some odd number of rice shops had supplies, for a total of four thousand some odd shi to transact business. The trading area was still poor, so although the supplies arriving these past days have been scarce, the market situation has not improved. The price of thick early-harvest japonica rice was barely stable, and only a bit over four hundred bags of thin rice cakes were sold, and the market situation was without any boom. The market has entered a state of stagnation, and there isn't much talk of change. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan varieties were all stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were seventeen to eighteen boats' worth of rice supply sources at He Xia. Because of the fine drizzling rain, few shops had stocks to sell, thus demand was low and prices of japonica rice tended to be soft. The situation for thin rice cakes was stable. The price of Yang Jian was weak, while the price of Yin Yuan stood firm and did not decrease. Bian Yuan and other goods did not see much fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Supply of Coarse Ke Xian Rice from Domestic Shops is Continuous <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, supplies of Ke Xian rice from various routes continued to arrive, and domestic demand was still present, so the market could still be sustained. However, the domestic shops only transacted in brown rice, and there was little demand for other products, so milled rice remained soft and weak, decreasing slightly in value. This is because milled rice only relies on the one road through this street, and so the demand is gradually diminishing. 1,370 bags of Jiangxi rice, 70 bags of Taiwan rice, 200 bags of Guangdong rice, and 120 bags of Jiangbei milled rice were sold in this street. 300 bags of Jiangxi brown rice, 587 bags of Jing brown rice, and 396 bags of Luo brown rice were sold in the domestic shops. Additionally, 103 bags of Saigon rice and 250 bags of Shashi milled rice were sold. The market situation has ups and downs compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Oil Cake Sales Increase, Oil Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, because domestic shops continued to purchase bean cake, the factory price of bean cake was stable and the cake market was also stable. The factories opened the day by selling 14,000+ level 4 cakes, 1,700 level 3 cakes, and 1,200+ steamer Hai Zhong cakes and 2,000+ steamer Niuzhuang cakes. If the weather becomes sunny, demand will increase and the market price will not be difficult to rise. The price of bean oil decreased to 690 items. The price of Dalian oil increased slightly and the price of Qishan oil decreased slightly. The price of soybeans was plain and uninspiring. Only domestic mills inquired about soy. 3 carloads of Harbin soy and 600 bags of Zhu Ma Dian soy were opened, with Guangzhou mills on this street buying 900 bags of Doudousha and yellow oil. Currently, the supply of truck soy is not strong, but Northeast soy is becoming thicker, so there is no reason to be excited about oil in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Plunges by 40 Points <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Because of renewed talks of tax cuts, the sugar market trended towards stagnation. The association listed level two-four coarse granulated white sugar, and red and white sugar were all listed at the original price, but no transactions occurred. Zhenji Brand 1 refined white sugar from this factory sold for 20.4 yuan and Jin Xin Dahua Brand 1 sold for 20.6 yuan. Few hands were traded and goods saw less demand and the steps went lower. For example, Guangbanghao merchants from Hainan opened the market offering 179 bags of red sugar at a price of 11.6 yuan, a decrease of 40 points from the previous price. Furthermore, Jianbang offered 50 bags of miscellaneous road white sugar for 16 yuan, level 2 white sugar for 12.6 yuan, and subsequent varieties had lower prices. More than ten bags were transacted. The others had scarce offerings because there was a shortage of action and there were no forward prices set when rumors emerged and people were unsure.</p>
<p>The deadline for exchanging contracts at the Sugar Company was yesterday. The total planned amount of Guangdong white sugar was 6,461 bags. 688 bags of level 5 coarse white sugar from the Shunde Factory were sold at 21.8 yuan, and 10 bags from the Quxi Factory were sold at 21.6 yuan. 10 bags of level 4 refined white sugar were sold at 20.6 yuan and the remaining 2 were sold at 20.8 yuan. Medium granulated white sugar sold for 19.8 yuan and none were transacted, and the price did not change from Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Still Constrained by Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Many Customers Besides Fujian are Waiting and Watching</p>
<p>After the price of cotton cloth dropped sharply yesterday after cotton yarn was put on sale, the impact of yesterday's price drops was that each customer was on alert and the price immediately became weaker. Various inventories continued to increase and few customers came to restock. Even if they wanted to, they postponed settling the transaction. Thus, real sales were greatly reduced. Only the Fuzhou gangs, who had constantly wanted product, slightly purchased Wu Luo Colored Blue Cloth for a price of 10.6 yuan, a Xian Bao picture bleached cloth for a price of 9.7 yuan, Shuang Li stripe poplin for a price of 2.7 cents per yard, Mei Yuan stripe poplin for 2.65 cents and Jia Sold plain poplin for 2.9 cents per yard. 8 Joy Yarn plain poplin was sold for 2.525 cents etc., with there being few items. Prices for Zi Huo Tiao Wu City Cloth was 5.99 yuan, Blue Grape Fine Twill cloth was 6.4 yuan, and 16 pound Si Ping Lian coarse twill cloth was 8.15 yuan etc., comprising 30 items. Also, Yu Feng Factory opened the street and introduced 100 bags of first month dragon head fine cloth for a price of 6.85 yuan, 5 Fu Ji Xiang Fine Cloth for 6.75 yuan and Yang He Fine Cloth for 6.85 yuan. 30 odd bags were opened.</p>
<h3 id="e223">This Factory's White Rubber Cloth Sales are Smooth <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The sales of this factory's white rubber cloth have been quite smooth recently. Sales are flourishing both on this street and in other locations. Because it is used to make the front of clothes, it can also be used to substitute for a white shirt. The prices vary depending on the number of bolt head pieces. The 60-70 bolts of white rubber cloth that were handled by dealers yesterday were each 30-40 pounds long and the price for a whole bolt was 34 cents. The price for 2-3 pieces per bolt was 30 cents and the price for 4-5 bolt heads was 28.5 cents. Large and small clothing stores in Sichuan Road, Xiafei Road, Daxin Street, and the Xiaoximen area all made purchases, with the purchasers being customers from the leather and woolen textiles industries.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Trading in Lower-End Parleys Cloth is Quite Strong <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Parleys has been quite popular recently, and it is more popular than any other kind of cloth. The large and small woolen and suit shops on this street have made large inventories and the lower-end Eastern and national goods that are 3+ yuan are even more active. Each day, large sales have come from the Yi Teng, Yong Feng, Yi He, and Hong Sheng brands. The association transacted on behalf of all companies yesterday and the single city of Shanghai retailed 2,000+ yards. Yi Teng goods sold for 3.25 yuan, Yong Feng for 3.35 yuan, Yi He for 3.7 yuan, and Hong Sheng single width for 1.65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Seafood: Kelp Inventory is Low and Sales are Also Slow <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The Market Situation is Still Stable; the Season for New Product Offerings is No Longer Close</p>
<p>Kelp, also known as haicao, comes from Japan and is produced in Hokkaido and in all coastal regions. The types are too numerous to count. Tenkachi, Ogoku, Horoizumi, Nemuro, Hamanaka are the best quality; the next best are Kunashiri, Akkeshi, Kawaji, Onne Village, and Shoucho; the next best are snake skin, two honors, Sanban, Jittai, Nekoashi, and Tekizoku. Beside the quality classes, there are also the harvest types of Fukuuke, Kakaeuke, and Akizuke. The new supplies usually come on stage at the summer solstice and stop at the end of autumn and start of winter. It was first imported to our country around the early years of the Qing Emperor Guangxu, and it has been sixty+ years since then. The sales market was initially limited to the northern provinces and then it gradually extended to sales in each city in the Yangtze River region. Because the prices were low and the taste was appropriate, the people were happy to purchase it. The highest amount of yearly imports totalled six to seven hundred thousand dan and the lowest was three to four hundred thousand dan. But in recent years, purchasing power has been weak because of the bankruptcy of rural areas in the country. Moreover, the production of each area isn't as good as it was in the past, so last year's rice product totalled 200,000+ dan which is less than half of the strongest years. Because the sales from each road aren't as good as in the past, sales are quite able to support stocks even though supplies are low. In the current market, Nemuro -Enchu- Fukuuke Harvests cost 9 yuan and the Akiuke Harvest is 8.8 yuan. Akkeshi -Kawaji- Kunashiri etc. - Fukuuke Harvests cost 8.6 yuan and the Akiuke Harvest is 8.3-8.4 yuan. Shoucho costs 8.2 yuan, Nekoashi costs 6.5 yuan, Nibantai costs 6.2 yuan, and Sanban costs 5.7-5.8 yuan. The other inferior goods have no market because supplies have ended. The prosperity of the market in the future must be decided by good harvest of the new supplies and the strength of each shop's sales road.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Miscellany: Sunflower Seeds are Stagnant and Prices are Falling <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Sunflower seeds were prosperous in the past, and the highest quality used to sell for 20.5 yuan, and the ordinary kind sold for 17-18 yuan. The sale trend is currently slowing and declining because black melon seeds are being seen at falling prices. The stores are selling Zhuang sunflower seeds for 17-18 yuan and ordinary seeds for 13-15 yuan. Prices have dropped by 2-3 yuan compared to the past. The fear is that prices will drop again if there is a long period of sluggish sales.</p>

<p>The amount of garden lead wire stocks in the market has become satisfied after large batches arrived from Osaka. The demand by customers and inventory has also become full. Because the military also makes few purchases and the factories also use little, the market situation is very thin. Traders are hurrying to hand off stock, so the market price is decreasing. The current price is 3.5 yuan per load, which is a small drop of 25 points compared to the past. The market price can decrease further if a large batch is contracted for sale or a cash transaction occurs.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Four to Five Thousand Loads of Black Sheet Arrive <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Many black sheet products have arrived recently. Large stocks have been transported to the Mitsubishi and Huishang warehouses, for a total of four to five thousand loads. The stocks in the Shanghai market have decreased because the sales road is not strong, and as a result the price is soft. The price of Hou Hua is 8.75 yuan per load and the price of thin Hua colored is 9.75 yuan per load. Compared to the past, each has decreased by 30-40 points.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Not Many Transactions Occur for Green Lead <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Transactions for Qing lead have not been lively recently. After the tea vendors stopped operations, lead factories, paint companies, and lead type makers had no good appetite. The market trends are not strong and the standard market price should decrease. The prices in overseas markets have repeatedly increased, so the price is able to maintain its former status. Foreign lead sells for 23 yuan per load and Xiang lead sells for 11.5 yuan per load. Only 240-250 loads were transacted in the city yesterday, and it is said that those goods were opened by metal shops in the French Concession.</p>

<p>Because the egg factories are buying and inquiring about the 100 pound double linked American tin plate, the market condition has quieted down and is showing signs of movement. The old steel plant goods sell for 48 yuan per case and the new steel plant goods sell for 45 yuan. It has been found that 400-500 cases are being transacted and the market severely lacks inventories.</p>

<p>Sincerely Celebrate with "My Mother Special Page"</p>
<p>Today, on Mother's Day, we send blessings to all mothers around the world and pay sincere respect to my mother (Zhou Shoujuan) who has endured hardship for 36 years.</p>
<h3 id="e231">My Mother <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying, National Chinan University</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, being a daughter-in-law was not easy. My mother, unable to endure her husband's abuse and her in-laws' scolding, escaped from that prison-like large family, carrying a baby girl—me—on her back.</p>
<p>A daughter-in-law running away, coming from a family of scholars for generations, was truly a disgrace. Therefore, her husband's family naturally wouldn't tolerate it, and our maternal grandparents, because of her unfilial return, disowned this shameful daughter. They only allocated some land and houses barely enough to sustain life. The mother and daughter lived a lonely life amidst cold ridicule and heated criticism.</p>
<p>Twenty years passed like a gentle spring breeze, fleeting away, disappearing. The lingering images of the disgraceful (?) event in people's minds had long faded and been forgotten. Even the father who gave birth to me reportedly died the year before last. As for me? Through my mother's skillful weaving and a difficult life, I finally completed secondary education and entered the gates of higher learning. But when I think of my mother's hardships, enduring twenty years as if it were a single day, how sad it is!</p>
<p>My mother often said, "If it weren't for you, I would have died long ago. For you, I have lived until now, enduring humiliation and suffering." I know that although I am already over twenty years old, my mother has suffered enough. The wrinkles on her face are deep, and her hair is white. It truly makes me afraid to gaze at her!</p>
<p>Mother! From the distant Shanghai shore, I wish you good health, peace, and happiness!</p>
<h3 id="e232">My Mother <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dongming, Songjiang Girls' High School</p>
<p>My mother is a very ordinary woman, seemingly without anything worthy of praise. But her greatness lies in this, because she has done her best silently, enabling my father to achieve great success in his scholarship, and enabling each of us siblings to become established.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather was a licentiate of the former Qing Dynasty, with very strict family teachings, but his speech was very humorous. My mother was greatly influenced by my maternal grandfather, often joking, but possessing a dignity that made people not dare to approach her. My mother did not study as a child. After marrying into our family, she gradually learned to read ordinary letters, and later she could even write family letters.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that my mother's greatness does not lie in any great career she pursued herself. Her greatness lies precisely in handling household affairs, which modern women disdain to do. My mother was only twenty-one or twenty-two years old when she got married, but because she was my father's second wife, she became the mother of three children. Fortunately, my elder brothers all had the temperament of boys, easygoing and gentle, and treated my mother like their own.</p>
<p>When my mother first came, our family moved to Beiping. We never had any relatives or old friends in Beiping. At that time, my father was either busy all day or reading books at home behind closed doors. All the household affairs were managed by my mother. My mother was so young, yet she had to take care of a family with three children. It was truly not an easy task. My father was helped by my mother, allowing him to feel unburdened by family responsibilities and devote himself to scholarship. This was a major reason for his future achievements.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, our family lived in Japan. That was arguably the most difficult time for our family financially. Although my father had some work to do, he also had to study, so it was always difficult to make ends meet. My mother also had another child—my fourth elder brother. Except for an old nanny brought from China, there was no one else to help with everything. Every item of clothing and socks for everyone from my father to the children was made by my mother herself, often working late into the night.</p>
<p>After we returned from Japan, we also lived in Shanghai. Later, my father went to Beiping, and the whole family moved there. While my father was teaching at Tsinghua Research Institute, he suddenly committed suicide at the Summer Palace. My mother was so saddened at that time that she almost didn't want to live. But for the sake of our seven children, she finally resolved to endure hardship and raise us, bringing us back to our hometown.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that my father left no money behind. Fortunately, my eldest brother was already able to be independent, and my mother tried every possible way to ensure that we all received education above the high school level. She often looked at my elder brothers as they became established, smiling through her tears. Now my youngest brother is already in the second year of high school, and all of us siblings know how hard-won the opportunity to study is, and how much effort our mother has put in, so we are able to study hard. Our grades in school often bring my mother a little more joy.</p>
<p>My mother is old now. She no longer has the energetic spirit she once had. This is due to the worries and sorrows she has suffered in the past ten years. But my mother's contribution to society is immortal.</p>
<h3 id="e233">My Mother <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Lucy, South Road Women's Normal School</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather was terrifyingly poor. He had two sons and a daughter. When his sons grew up, he also took his daughter and left that broken home. My maternal grandmother relied on the few coins her eldest son earned in the dyehouse to make a living, and she also had to set aside some money for her youngest son to study in private school. Every time she held her rice bowl, she thought of her runaway husband and daughter.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather wandered in the Jiangnan region; at the same time, his daughter also encountered someone who saved her. This was a wealthy philanthropist in Yiwu, who was also my father.</p>
<p>My father's original family was a complex one, also a large clan. He had married a wife before, and the children she bore were already grown up, and all had married.</p>
<p>This clearly proves my father's age. He was more than twenty years older than my mother. After my mother entered the family, no one sympathized with or comforted her except my father. She endured for the sake of life, for the sake of emotion. In that large family at that time, a large number of slaves were kept. They similarly looked down on my mother, not thinking of themselves.</p>
<p>My father left early and returned late, working outside, so the time he spent with my mother was very little. Thus, my mother's grief deepened day by day. She was often melancholic, taciturn, staring blankly in concentration.</p>
<p>My mother continued to give birth to my elder brother, elder sister, and me amidst a situation of being besieged on all sides. At that time, how she longed for these children to grow up, to gain some solace in life! But when these children had not yet understood the pain of life, they still had to be naughty, causing my mother more pain, and she wept alone.</p>
<p>At that time, not only did my mother not have freedom, we also had no freedom; especially me. I could not win anyone's favor and was often beaten severely by the slaves. Therefore, in my childhood, I was pitifully thin and pale.</p>
<p>We grew up amidst bitter winds and rain.</p>
<p>My father remarried, lived outside, and also had two sons. My mother became extraordinarily depressed, growing inwardly.</p>
<p>One summer, a hot summer, the viewing ornaments deteriorated due to age, the salt yellowed and failed, family affairs declined; and all the erosions of life led to death. My mother looked at these three orphans, her tears streaming down, gradually growing thin. At that time, I was twelve, my sister was fourteen, and my brother was sixteen.</p>
<p>'The spirit is thinner than the autumn clouds.' The door and courtyard were so quiet that they were like an ancient temple. A group of people carrying [the coffin] walked slowly in front of the street, and the footprints of people who had been there had been obliterated. My mother clenched her fists, pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>She could not get the only living expenses. The economic power of the family was still controlled by others. They were so careful that they would not let even a speck of money slip through their fingers. At this time, no one could understand her, except her children. She bit her lip tightly and sold all her jewelry. Ah! She was startled that she was a woman, a widow, in her forties. She still had to wrestle with her living environment.</p>
<p>Her struggles, her endeavors, led us onto the broad, correct path. Therefore, in recent years, my brother has had a career, and my sister has also become a teacher. Only I continue to study.</p>
<p>In my mother's white hair and wrinkles, the light of hope and happiness is revealed. She said: "I am approaching old age. I hope you young children will move forward! Do not let go, do not be discouraged. Because you have become aware of the darkness, you will pursue the light; the light will also illuminate everything about you. May you always remember my words!"</p>
<p>We looked at the distant sky, smiling and shedding tears.</p>

<p>— Lin Bin, Shanghai Yunzhong Girls' School</p>
<p>Hair streaked with snow, a very high nose, a long, square face, imprinted with wrinkles born of labor, a dimple almost erased by wrinkles, a pair of eyes with deep emotion and love—this is the outline of my mother.</p>
<p>A county along the Qiantang River is the place where my mother was born.</p>
<p>My mother is a woman in her fifties. When she was young, she was bound by the feudal barriers of that time, which deprived her of the opportunity to learn to read. Therefore, she was a blind person with open eyes. She struggled and strove, seeking a glimmer of hope to [missing text] one [missing text] of being literate. The thousands of years of feudal [missing text] covered her eyes, and thousands of years of [missing text] women's [missing text] bound her hands and feet. She could not see the light, she could not explain [missing text] and struggled. All she could do was groan without illness in the powerful, feudal, autocratic prison [missing text] with women who suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>Although my mother's father and mother were people of the previous century, they tried their best to give a little light to their beloved daughter in a dim and harsh environment, but the result was the same: they were subjected to pointing fingers. They watched their daughter bury her desire for knowledge for the sake of dark feudalism.</p>
<p>Later, my mother got married. She managed the family diligently, trying to make a family in a time of transition between the old and new very peaceful, pure, and happy. She cooked meals, sewed clothes, and in her spare time, she asked me to tell her about national affairs. Sometimes I would pout and refuse to read the newspaper or tell her about it. She would then stroke my head with her maternal hand and say, "Child, you must pity your mother. She had no opportunity to study when she was young, so now she is illiterate, cannot read the newspaper, and cannot directly serve the country. In the future, you must use what you can do to help people who cannot do things. Do you understand, child?" Her voice was full of sadness, and my eyes were filled with tears of regret.</p>
<p>Although my mother herself had never studied, when I came home from school, after a certain period of rest, she would urge me to review my studies. She said, "Studying hard is like building yourself firmly. There is your own shadow shaking in the books!" I trusted my mother's words very much, so I worked hard to build myself and find my shadow in the books.</p>
<p>I entered this world with the heart my mother gave me—but not long ago, my mother left me forever. On her deathbed, she said to me, "Child, you are not my exclusive daughter. I have given you to humanity. You are the daughter of humanity. You must work hard for humanity, you must sacrifice for humanity!" My mother loved me very much. There was no pretense, deception, or hypocrisy in her love. All there was was light, warmth, and greatness. Although my mother has left me forever, she did not take her love from my heart! This kind of love overflows in my body and will need me to release it in the future. I want to take my mother's love to love humanity—I am the daughter of humanity—because mother's love is not [missing text] occupied by one person. It [missing text] should [missing text] be scattered, it should shine like the sunlight, so that there will not be a single person in the world who is abandoned without love!</p>
<p>My mother lived her life like this. She has now passed away, but her love continues to grow!—Because nothing can extinguish the love of mothers in the world!</p>
<p>On Mother's Day, bless the health of mothers! Bless all those who have mothers!—Because I am a child without a mother! But, orphans without mothers, let us all call out "Mother" in unison!</p>

<p>My mother and I have not seen each other for only a little over two months, but I feel that the time of a little over two months is too long for me. For over two months, in this traveler's land, in this foreign land with no relatives, a traveler's heart is always missing my elderly mother. Especially in this spring day when the cuckoo's calls echo through the wilderness, it deeply touches my lost Han [Chinese] heart. I can't wait to immediately return to my mother's side, throw myself into her gentle [arms], and be stroked by her warm hands.</p>
<p>My mother occupies my entire heart. Sometimes, although I also love books, I never have the passion to love my mother. In fact, my mother is the only one who loves me, so the one I love most is also my mother. After class, on moonlit nights with silver light pouring down, I remember my mother. Isn't this round, white plate my mother's round face? On fragrant mornings, I also think of my mother. Aren't these petals my mother's beautiful smile? In short, everything that I love, I consider to be an epitome of my mother's life.</p>
<p>The spring is bright, the birds are singing, and I am immersed in memories of the past. This is something that happened eight years ago; I returned from night school and caught a pair of little sparrows to play with. A [thin rope] was tightly [tied] on [a sparrow's] foot, and I almost killed it by playing with it. Carelessly, my mother saw it, which resonated with her heartstrings and evoked great emotions. Her eyes suddenly filled with crystal tears, "Zhen'er; do you love Mom?" I was holding the rope in my hand and said in surprise to my mother, "Mom, I love you, I love Mom the most!" My mother stroked my hair and said, "Are you willing to leave your mom?" "No, I will never leave Mom; Mom, what's wrong with your eyes?" I was holding the rope in one hand and immediately grabbed the corner of my mother's clothes with the other. "Zhen'er! Think about it, does this bird have a mom?" I cried; I suddenly threw myself into my mother's arms and burst into loud sobs...</p>
<p>Sparrows are playing spring tunes on the branches. They are enjoying the happiness of family, but I am in this traveler's land, in this foreign land with no relatives, alone immersed in memories of the past, longing for my mother.</p>

<p>My father died when I was eleven years old. At that time, our family consisted of an elderly grandmother, three younger siblings than me, and my eldest sister, who was only one year older than me. We did not understand any worldly affairs, and only knew to surround our mother, guarding before my father's spirit, weeping. The situation at that time, even thinking about it now, is still very sad.</p>
<p>After my father died, the local bullies often took the opportunity to bully us, writing what donations, and we were assigned more than others. My mother had no choice but to mediate and run around at the doors of these powerful people, often having to see their unjust faces; but my mother never brought back even a hint of anger for us to see.</p>
<p>From my mother's conversation, we knew that my maternal grandmother gave my mother a completely typical education of a virtuous wife and good mother; and my mother herself was even more fully aware that she was a responsible person in society, so my mother felt a great interest in all social issues. My mother did not advocate keeping maids, saying, "It is the most inhumane thing to separate other people's families."</p>
<p>My mother managed the household, imbuing dignity with kindness. My mother never loudly scolded anyone, but everyone had a sense of respect and love for her. Therefore, not only was our family well-organized, but also harmonious and cheerful.</p>
<p>When my father was alive, he was of a chivalrous nature, often helping friends generously, not hesitating to spend a thousand gold. After my father died, debts piled up, and creditors filled the door. My mother had to raise money to repay old debts, support household expenses, and also consider our tuition, so that we would not drop out of school; but my mother often said to us: "I send you to school, not hoping that you will earn money. Studying is about understanding principles. As long as you can serve society in the future and be a complete person, my responsibility will be fulfilled."</p>
<p>When I was about to leave, my mother also said to me: "It is very painful for people who cannot read. After you obtain knowledge yourself, do not forget these people who do not have the opportunity to study." This clearly told me not to study only for myself.</p>
<p>In our hometown, few women can receive education. My mother resolutely sent us sisters to school under that stubborn feudal force, all the way to the present—university.</p>
<p>It has been two years since I came out, and I have not yet returned to see my mother. I don't know how much white hair and wrinkles this heavy economic burden has added to my mother.</p>
<h3 id="e237">My Mother <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yu, Graduate of Anhui University</p>
<p>A purer love than a mother's cannot be found; a scene more meaningful than a child surrounding a mother cannot be found either.</p>
<p>Yes, "My father is the best father in the world, my mother is the best mother in the world." I have seen these two sentences somewhere.</p>
<p>My home is in a village ten miles away from Xiuning County, Anhui Province. There are verdant mountains, lush trees, a small stone bridge, and flowing water in the clear stream below. When the weather is fine, just stand in a place in the village where the view is unobstructed, and you can see the peaks of Huangshan Mountain vaguely between the clouds and sky hundreds of miles away. This is a poetic environment. Before the Taiping Rebellion, the villagers lived and worked in peace and contentment, as if it were a paradise. After the Taiping Rebellion, I heard that my great-grandfather started to pass down farming and reading, maintaining a frugal family style, but life was difficult. My grandfather was a scholar. He treated people and things with a rigorous scholarly nature. My father was raised as a scholar by my grandfather's order.</p>
<p>When my mother came to my house, my great-grandmother and grandparents were still alive. My grandfather was an official traveling in the north, and the family affairs were managed by my great-grandmother. She was a virtuous daughter-in-law serving two generations of elders. My father passed the imperial examination at the prefecture level at the age of nineteen, but did not have money to spend to come home. My mother gave her "greeting gift" as a bride to someone to take to my father to use, because she wanted to commemorate her maternal grandparents, she did not take jewelry to exchange for it. At the same time, in this year, my eldest sister was born, and the following year, my second sister was born. At this time, my father was teaching at the Fengtian Higher School. A year later, he returned to his hometown to say goodbye to his family before going to study in the Americas. At that time, everyone thought that my mother would come out to obstruct him, but it was not so. In addition to giving my father the money that she and her sisters had saved over the years, she also [strengthened] my father's courage to study abroad. From then on, for seven years, my great-grandfather and grandfather died one after another. My mother served my grandmother above, and supported my eldest and second sisters below. In a not-so-rich family, she worked hard to keep my grandmother happy, and my eldest and second sisters both entered school, and did not lack anything.</p>
<p>When my father returned to China, he took my grandmother's whole family to Shanghai. My mother was exactly thirty years old. This was the beginning of my mother's managing the family. In the three years that followed, although I and my younger brother were born, she managed the family strictly. In addition to assigning the duties of the servants, she mostly personally directed and handled things. When we sisters grew up, in addition to urging us to study at any time, she also taught each of us to learn part of the housework. Whether the family was well-off or poor, my family was always a clean and orderly family that made people feel good. Although my mother was strict, she was also very kind. She treated her children and servants with kindness and harmony, unless there was a major mistake. When we were sick or when we were leaving home to go to school, she would personally pack our luggage for us. What the old woman thought of and did was always before us. My mother does not play cards or smoke. Her hobby is flowers and plants. She would not waste the money her father earned with his blood and sweat, but when she used money, she made her husband, children, relatives, and friends feel comfortable, and the poor people received real benefits. It was four years ago, right? My father was wrongly accused in office and was imprisoned for almost a year. My mother exchanged her exquisite jewelry for the tuition for me and my younger brother to enter university, and always earnestly instructed me and my younger brother on how to be extraordinary children.</p>
<p>My mother grew up under the old [education]. She is filial to her parents-in-law, she loves her husband and children, and she can love anyone. Now she is a woman of fifty-four years old. She cannot give speeches, cannot go to dance halls, cannot go to restaurants every day, cannot run schools,... but she will always be the beloved daughter of my maternal grandparents, the virtuous wife of my father, the good mother of us sisters! Good mother, blessings to you!</p>

<p>— Jia Qiurui, Wuben Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>A round face, a plump figure, and a generous way of treating people—this is my mother. Her surname is Lei, and her given name is Yimei. She was born in Jingzhou, Gansu Province. Her family was not very wealthy. My father said, "She entered the Jia family's door when she was nineteen years old."</p>
<p>When the east turns white, she gets up to cook porridge and handle all the household affairs, such as sweeping the floor! Washing clothes! Buying groceries! Doing needlework! She does everything herself. Although she labors like a panting ox, she has never been sick, nor has she ever uttered a complaint? This is the first special feature of her managing the family.</p>
<p>The second special feature of her managing the family is managing her children, not allowing us to be infected with bad habits and customs, such as smoking, alcohol, and gambling. Every night, she forcibly requires us to review our homework for two hours. On holidays, she does not allow us to play alone, but leads us to play, fearing that we will learn the habits of naughty children.</p>
<p>She is very capable in doing things. One thing can illustrate it. Once, my father suffered from a very serious pinkeye. Although various eye drops were used to treat it, it could not be cured. Later, she thought of an old method from a doctor, which was to lick it with her tongue, and it was finally cured.</p>
<p>Every year in the summer, a group of coolies come to my house to ask my mother for medicines to prevent epidemics and relieve heatstroke (such as Shayaoshui medicine tea, etc.). She always tries her best to supply them. In the severe winter, she printed two hundred rice tickets and bought eighty sets of clothes to give to the extremely poor people. She has been doing this kind of "charitable" thing for five years.</p>
<p>My mother has also done a lot for the good deeds of society. In addition to donating money for relief, she always tries her best to help orphans who have no home to return to. Therefore, people living near my house say that my mother is a blessed grandchild.</p>
<p>The above is my mother's background, management of the family, and contribution to society!</p>
<h3 id="e239">My Mother <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renhui, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School</p>
<p>My mother was my maternal grandmother's first daughter. She was a young lady in a large family, but because there were many people, her mother favored sons over daughters and didn't love her very much. Only her grandmother truly protected her. She hired a teacher especially for her to teach her to read. From then on, she lived with her grandmother. She worked hard at her studies, and her life was happy and blessed. She married at the age of ten, and a year later, she gave birth to my older brother, and then she gave birth to me. In the third month of the year after I was born in October, my father unfortunately passed away! My twenty-four-year-old mother became a widow.</p>
<p>Poor mother, seeing us two siblings, one three years old and the other one year old, how could she not be filled with anxiety! The love she had for us was indescribable. I remember when I was eight years old, my older brother fell ill. How worried my mother was at that time! She couldn't eat in peace during the day! She couldn't sleep peacefully at night! She didn't feel fatigue and always maintained her spirits, earnestly hoping that my brother would get rid of the sickness as soon as possible. My kind mother was very religious. For the sake of her children, she ate vegetarian food for three months of the year in the first, fifth, and ninth months. When we were studying, she sat beside us to supervise. Alas! She tasted all kinds of hardships for our sakes.</p>
<p>My mother was extremely simple and frugal. The household equipment was very simple and clean. She had considerable artistic skills. She handled all the income and expenditure accounts by herself. Even a penny was taken very seriously. Although no one in my family earns money now, our siblings' education and the family's expenses do not require borrowing from outside. Our family is very modern. It is really fun and happy. Everything we enjoy is managed by my mother for us.</p>
<p>My home is in a not-so-developed countryside. Everything is very isolated. As for education, there is even less to mention. When my grandfather saw this situation, he started a primary school in the countryside. My mother has been working at the school ever since, for more than ten years now. Her benevolent heart extends to the general public. Everyone in my hometown praises her ability to handle affairs. I have such a mother, and I am really the happiest person in the world, but how can I repay my mother's deep kindness!</p>

<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Kidney weakness, also known as intestinal weakness, is caused by excessive masturbation and sexual activity, leading to the decline of the reproductive glands and the formation of conditions such as sexual weakness and small size. It can also be caused by weak endowment. The most effective treatment for this condition is to administer reproductive gland preparations to stimulate the weakened glands. Combined with electrotherapy, the treatment will be even faster.</p>
<p>Last autumn, a patient, Mr. Ge Youren, came to me complaining of kidney weakness and infertility after a long marriage. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" from Wuzhou Pharmacy and prescribed it. To expedite the treatment, I referred him to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for electrotherapy. After about a month, his kidney weakness was cured, and his development was restored. Last month, he introduced his friend, Mr. Yue, to me to treat the same condition. He said that his wife was already two months pregnant.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Spermatorrhea - Premature Ejaculation <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation are the two most common sexual diseases. The root cause of these diseases also lies in the weakness of the reproductive glands. The targeted treatment is also mainly "Reproductive Element" and electrotherapy. However, the sperm gate of patients with spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission is often loose, so it is necessary to use "Sperm-Locking Pills", with the "Hymetop's" brand being the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In early spring, a patient, Zhang Zicheng, came to the clinic complaining of spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. I instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Reproductive Element" and "Hymetop's Sperm-Locking Pills" from Taihe Pharmacy and take them. After taking five boxes in a row, both symptoms disappeared, and his body also returned to health.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Safe Method for Quitting Smoking <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>During the period of quitting smoking, the most painful thing is the loss of mental pleasure, and the changes in physiology cause old diseases to appear one after another. This often makes the quitter feel mentally depressed and the illness unbearable. Therefore, to seek a safe way to quit smoking, it is necessary to take care of both weakness and disease.</p>
<p>"Reproductive Element" is a good medicine for quitting smoking that nourishes and supplements, detoxifies and breaks addiction, revives and treats diseases. Smokers who take it will feel mentally happy, and all weakness will be eliminated. It quickly breaks addiction and restores health, achieving the most satisfactory effect of safe smoking cessation. Those who also suffer from spermatorrhea should also take "Hymetop's Sperm-Locking Pills". Those with bone pain should take "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills". As for stomach pain and weakness, "Stomach Pain Reliever" and "Stomach Nourishing Element" can cure them completely.</p>
<p>(Note) Women who quit smoking should take "Female Reproductive Element" with the word "Female" on it.</p>
<p>(Dosage) Three times a day, two to four tablets each time, or as directed by a physician.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Sore Joints and Muscle Cramps <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>This condition is mostly caused by internal rheumatism and excessive uric acid. It can also be caused by residual toxins that have not been cleared and cause internal trouble. It is difficult to cure completely with biased medication.</p>
<p>In early spring, a patient, Mr. Chen Qingxun, came to me complaining of sore joints and muscle cramps. I instructed him to purchase "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills" from the Sino-French Pharmacy to remove his uric toxins and rheumatism. After taking it for about a month, he announced that he was completely cured.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Stomach Pain is Not Necessarily a Chronic Disease <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>It can be cured with the right medicine!</p>
<p>Last winter, a patient with long-term stomach pain, Mr. Li Yuankun, was introduced to me by his close friend, Mr. Tang. According to him, he had been suffering from stomach pain for more than ten years. He had tried various medicines without success and regarded it as a chronic disease, thinking that it could not be cured. Because he saw that Mr. Tang's severe stomach pain was cured by me, he asked him to introduce him to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Reliever" from the Western Medicine Department of the New New Company to treat the root cause of his stomach pain and to take "Stomach Nourishing Element" to nourish his weakened stomach. Because the medicine was targeted, it achieved the same satisfactory results.</p>

<p>(1) Electrotherapy and Medicine for Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Weakness</p>
<p>Restoring vitality and regaining strength.</p>
<p>Patient Shen Zuoren, 36 years old, from Baoying, merchant. (Chief complaint) — Premature ejaculation, kidney weakness, weak body, and mental depression. (Medical history) — Mr. Shen was previously infected with smegma, which has been difficult to cure completely, causing damage to his reproductive glands, resulting in weakness. Not only did the premature ejaculation he suffered from at an early age worsen, but he also suffered from kidney weakness. In early spring, he asked Mr. Ni, who had completely cured his smegma and had his foreskin cut at my clinic, to introduce him for treatment. (Treatment) — I used both electrotherapy and medicine to completely cure his smegma and other venereal diseases. I mainly used "Reproductive Element" to treat his kidney weakness and premature ejaculation. Mr. Shen purchased and took the medicine as directed from the Sino-Western Pharmacy. After taking the medicine, his reproductive glands immediately became stronger. After his vitality was restored, his muscles regained strength, and his spirits were refreshed. He was completely different from before.</p>
<p>(2) Treating Both the Symptoms and Root Cause of Venereal Disease in Young People</p>
<p>Nourishing the deficiencies and saving the weak.</p>
<p>Patient Yu Yinghai, 21 years old, from Wuxi, student. (Chief complaint) — Spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, insomnia, forgetfulness, sallow complexion, thin body, dizziness, and blurred vision. (Medical history) — Before adulthood, Mr. Yu was induced by bad friends and mistakenly committed masturbation, resulting in the inability of his body to develop. Gradually, the symptoms he complained of appeared, with hundreds of changes, which was extremely painful. Last month, he began to visit me for treatment. (Treatment) — After I questioned him, I learned that Mr. Yu had spermatorrhea several times a month. His sperm gate was extremely loose, and his reproductive glands had also weakened. It would not work if he did not take both "Hymetop's Sperm-Locking Pills" and "Reproductive Element". Mr. Yu purchased and took the medicines from Huamei Pharmacy. After taking them for about a month, the symptoms disappeared, and his body also recovered its strength, as if celebrating a new life.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Treatment for Lower Back Pain, Stomach Pain, and Numb Limbs</p>
<p>Treating and supplementing are equally important. The famous medicine is Micron.</p>
<p>Patient Fang Zonghai, 43 years old, from Nanjing, works in a certain agency. (Chief complaint) — Lower back pain, back pain, stomach pain, weak stomach, body tremors, and numb limbs. (Medical history) — Mr. Fang first suffered from stomach pain, followed by rheumatism, which led to the symptoms he complained of. Prolonged lack of treatment caused hundreds of changes, making the weakness even worse. Not only did his body lose its development, but it also led to premature senility. At the end of winter, he asked Mr. Feng Xiangshan, who had cured his premature ejaculation at my clinic, to introduce him for treatment. (Treatment) — I prescribed medicine according to his symptoms and instructed him to purchase the famous medicines "Reproductive Element," "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills," and "Stomach Pain Reliever" and "Stomach Nourishing Element" from Wing On Company to take care of their sources of pain separately. After taking it for about four weeks, it achieved the most satisfactory and effective results.</p>
<p>Women's Hidden Illnesses Recover Health and Beauty</p>
<p>Regulating menstruation and treating leukorrhea, developing the breasts.</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Yuan Mingcai, 28 years old, from Wuxing. (Chief complaint) — Menstrual irregularities, persistent leukorrhea, and dry and shriveled breasts, losing health and beauty. (Medical history) — Mrs. Yuan's endowment was insufficient, and her body was weak. Her menstruation was either early or late, and the amount and color were abnormal. After marriage, she suffered even more from leukorrhea, muscle wasting, and shrunken breasts. Health and beauty were lost. This spring, she was introduced to me for treatment by her close relatives. (Treatment) — My diagnosis was that Mrs. Yuan's source of illness was the weakness of her reproductive glands, which could not be effective with other agents. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Element" from the Sino-British Pharmacy and use "Leukorrhea Reliever" externally and instructed her to treat herself according to the instructions. Before finishing half a dozen, she felt that her menstruation was regulated and the leukorrhea was cleared. Her breasts developed, regaining the beauty that a young woman should have.</p>

<p>— Bored</p>
<p>The Italian army entered A-jing on May 5th. The modern tragedy reached its final act. The A-people fought hard for seven months, and the matter was finally over, becoming Italy's sacrifice. However, according to the telegram from A-jing on the 5th, the entire city of A-jing was on fire, thick smoke billowed everywhere, and mobs roamed everywhere looting. People in A-jing were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Italian army. However, the Italian army did not want to be accused of occupying A-jing by force, so they did not rush to enter. Only when the A-jing delegation went to the Italian army to hand over the capital did the Italian army enter. This clearly shows that Italy forcibly occupied A-guo, but refused to take the name of forcible occupation. In this way, A-guo's demise was not Italy's forcible occupation, but rather A-guo itself not wanting its country and offering A-guo to Italy entirely. Is this deceiving someone or deceiving heaven? The tragedy of national subjugation is so incredible.</p>
<p>When the A-king left the capital, important leaders of A-guo, such as General Gustai and General Gasa, sat in the reception room of the Governor's Palace. The A-queen and her children stayed in the private room. When the A-king left the Governor's Palace, he walked down the steps shoulder to shoulder with the queen, and the children followed behind. General Gasa and others stood on both sides. When the A-king and queen passed in front of them, they all bowed to the ground. Everyone was silent at the time, and the scene was very sad. The A-king suffered such a tragedy of national subjugation, and the A-people tasted the feeling of national subjugation. This was originally a very painful and heartbreaking period. However, at that time, there were two news reporters who, because the Italian army had not yet entered the capital, took the opportunity to hold a wedding at the British Embassy. The groom was the Times reporter, Steel, and the bride was the Spanish Ms. Hariros, a special reporter for the French newspaper. When the ceremony was held, the sound of gunfire from the mobs outside the embassy was like a string of pearls. Therefore, some newspapers called it a good story at the time of the subjugation of Abyssinia. Even from the perspective of the news reporter, it was a good story. They are losing their country, and we are getting married. What does it have to do with each other? But what kind of impression does it leave on the local people? Therefore, I say that there is no compassion in the world.</p>
<p>When the Italian army was approaching A-jing, Mussolini still ordered a test of public mobilization, announcing this decision in the House of Representatives. Representatives of the diplomatic corps, senior military officers from the army, navy, and air force were present. First, Count Chiano gave the opening speech. His first words were, "The A-king has fled." Then the entire house cheered, and the sound shook the roof. The parliament then adjourned for an hour to express its joy at the turning point in the A-guo war. Naturally, Italy had achieved its goal of occupying A-guo by force, so how could it not be joyous? The other day, the British cabinet held a meeting to study the issue of the A-king's departure and decided on the steps that the British government had taken regarding this matter. However, according to semi-official sources, the sanctions ultimately failed. Since this has been proven to be true, Britain does not intend to persist in its sanctions policy in the future. Some people in the political circles also said that the League of Nations must be reformed in the future, because the League of Nations' prestige has been swept away. In the A-Italy war, Britain helped A-guo a lot, but it was also fruitless. At this point, it can only say a few passive idle words. Even if there is compassion but no compassionate power, it can only be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e251">After Watching "Wet Paint" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The China Traveling Theater performed at the Carlton</p>
<p>In terms of meaning, a play like "Wet Paint" is much more meaningful than plays like "Lady Windermere's Fan" or "Melo-Melos." Although at this time of national crisis, in this difficult month of blood and May, it is not enough to shoulder the sacred responsibility of national defense drama.</p>
<p>In "Wet Paint," it ridicules Dr. Ha, the slave of that poor and dirty family. It also illustrates that the works of a so-called "artist" must wait for several years after his death and must pass through the hands of merchants to increase in price and arouse interest. It also sharply points out that there is a kind of so-called critic who, despite pretending to express his noble views, is still always mixed up with merchants and uses each other. Just look at the time when Dr. Ha and Lawson were bargaining, wasn't our noble critic Mr. Dan Wenbo acting as a "fair" appraiser?</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>These are what we can see in the play. Now let's take a step further and see what kind of painter Chrispin, who enjoyed fame fifteen years after his death, was like.</p>
<p>"The Big Stone Bridge" and "The Old Granary," these kinds of landscape paintings, these so-called masterpieces that caused a sensation in London, are actually nothing more than the decadent expressions of the transitional era. These works of art for art's sake happened to suit the temperament of the old men who were going backwards, plus the romance of his "bitter life" before his death. As a result, the entire London was in an uproar. Our noble critic, Mr. Dan Wenbo, wanted to know the detailed romance between Guan Ni and Chrispin. His motive was exactly the same as the motive of the book and painting merchants to collect his posthumous works.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "Wet Paint" did not expose the ugliness of the noble critic, nor did it explain what kind of painter Chrispin was. It only gave the pitiful and ridiculous family slave—Dr. Ha—a vicious ridicule. Objectively, also because it did not reveal what kind of painter Chrispin was, this artist of art for art's sake also became an artist on the nerves of the audience.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the director exaggerated the movements of Dr. Ha, which focused the audience's attention on him. That method is very good. However, I think that simply exaggerating the movements of a character will create the danger of disharmony in the entire play. Therefore, I am not against using exaggeration to handle satirical plays, but what is debatable is that each character in the entire play should be given a kind of exaggeration.</p>
<p>As for other things, since the exaggeration method has been used, then in many places, sound effects can be added to further emphasize the exaggerated elements to help with the inadequacy of the movements. (The reason why the impression of the fake inspector eating steak in "The Government Inspector" still remains in our minds is because of this.)</p>
<p>Stage decoration and lighting are the strengths of Zhonglu. In "Wet Paint," the lighting is still well handled, especially the time of each act is well distinguished, so that the audience can tell what time it is at a glance. As for the stage decoration, the composition is not as beautiful as the previous ones. On the wall, after the twelve-pound painting of Ada was taken down, a shadow of the picture frame should be left on the "hard sheet" (this is also mentioned in the lines). But now there is none, which will make the audience lose their sense of reality.</p>
<p>The best of the actors' acting skills is "Dr. Ha" Dai Ya, and the others are almost dimmed by him. (This is related to the special way of exaggerating him.) Zhao Huishen's acting was very hard, but she didn't act very well. Comparatively, Wu Jing's Mrs. Ha was still more harmonious. The rest are all mediocre.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Sending Away the Stupid God (Continued) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>—Village Customs Collection—</p>
<p>"Help! Are you... are you going to kill me? You... you black-hearted people will not have a good day!..." She just sat in the bamboo basket, shouting, crying, and struggling. But everyone pretended not to hear, and even drank more enthusiastically, running—jumping—bounding—along the stream, by the pond, on the flat ground, on the dangerous slopes, many people forgot their fatigue as if they were crazy, heartlessly playing with this poor woman. The copper gong was also beaten until it made a broken sound, which sounded a bit like Mo Afu's wife's trembling cry!</p>
<p>"Send away the stupid god!" Everyone shouted across the garden.</p>
<p>"Send away the stupid god!" They shouted again across the camphor tree field.</p>
<p>"Mo Afu's wife's stupid god is frightened away!" A group of young people tried their best to shout, until their throats were hoarse, until their clothes were soaked with sweat, but they still had to shout.</p>
<p>They were as excited as if it were a temple fair. When the sun slowly climbed over Qideng Mountain, climbed over Linwu Mountain, and hung high above the Taoist Cave on the top of Silong Mountain, they carried Mo Afu's wife, turned from White Snake Stream to Bandit Mountain, making her almost dead of exhaustion. She fell in the corner of the basket and didn't move, just closing her eyes tightly and letting them do as they pleased, having lost consciousness.</p>
<p>"Throw her in the stream!" Xiao Gen said this to the people carrying the basket.</p>
<p>"The water is too deep, it won't work here," said one of the people carrying the basket.</p>
<p>"The Green Lotus Pond is better, the water is shallower there!"</p>
<p>They passed through the chestnut tree and walked over the Earth Ladder Bridge, arriving at the edge of the Green Lotus Pond.</p>
<p>"Plop!" The woman went into the water together with the basket, and the water splashed very high, wetting many people's bodies.</p>
<p>"Aah!" She managed to call out like this, struggling a few times in the water, and then lay down in the shallow water. Then a few people scrambled down again and fished her out, lying her down on the grass to let her spit out the water she had swallowed.</p>
<p>The sun shone on the old, dirty clothes on her body that were soaked and muddy, her face was terribly pale, her eyeballs were half-staring, her breathing was very rapid and subtle, and her body seemed to be trembling. Someone poked her swollen belly, and a mouthful of water would gurgle out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Go burn a bowl of reed soup and try to pour it down her!" A Binan said this to his wife. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e254">After the Opening <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Heng</p>
<p>The wind has been blowing for two days, and now it has finally stopped. The sun is showing a smiling face, and everything seems to have a bit more vitality. The quiet streets have also become lively right away. However, the most lively place is the health center near the county government—because today is the opening day.</p>
<p>The newly painted gate has two brand-new Kuomintang flags crossed. Next to the gate hangs a wooden plaque with black characters on a white background: "XX County Health Center." The elegant handwriting is immediately recognizable as that of the county magistrate. Inside the gate, all kinds of officials, big and small, from various institutions are crowded together, all in black uniforms and black felt hats. They all have smiling faces, seemingly anticipating the host's social graces. Perhaps because they couldn't find the host, some eyes shifted to the several nurses in white uniforms. Their short, black hair is topped with a snow-white headscarf, which is matched with a white long gown; nestled in this group of black figures, they are distinctly outstanding. It's a pity there are too many people, and the stockings and high heels under their gowns are squeezed and have no chance to be displayed, but even just half of it is enough to be impressive; in this small county town.</p>
<p>Pushing and shoving, they walk through several rooms, look at several smiling faces, and that concludes the tour. Finally, everyone gathers in the auditorium, ready for the official meeting.</p>
<p>With a burst of bell-ringing, a fat man squeezes onto the stage, and a burst of applause erupts below. The fat man squints at the audience, his mouth moving, seemingly speaking, but no one can hear what he is saying. Then they see his mouth stretch into a forced smile, and he comes down. Another round of applause.</p>
<p>After several speeches and rounds of applause, the ceremony concludes. The audience leaves with satisfied smiles, nodding to every smiling face. They elegantly squeeze out of the door. Inside the room, there are still melon seed shells all over the floor.</p>
<p>"Old Li, chase away the idlers outside the door! They're like a wall, surrounding that area. Tell them this isn't a funeral!" The fat man sees off the guests, and as soon as he returns inside the door, he shouts like this.</p>
<p>"Yes." Old Li is busy sweeping up melon seed shells, cigarette butts, and whatnot from the ground, and when he hears this, he drops his broom and runs out. The fat man steps into another room.</p>
<p>"Nurses' Office." A wooden plaque with wet paint hangs beside the door.</p>
<p>"How is it? Satisfied?" Miss Zhang. The fat man returns to his smiling face.</p>
<p>"Terrible! They're all like pigs," Miss Zhang says as she takes off her high heels.</p>
<p>"This is coming to the 'countryside,'" the fat man laughs, then continues, "Of course they're stupid, but that has its advantages: they're easy to deal with." The fat man moves closer to Miss Zhang. The last few words are spoken particularly softly. The response is a burst of giggling laughter.</p>

<h3 id="e259">French Teague Lee Thaisak Masterpiece "Escape from Devil's Island" Coming Soon <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Three small islands on the South American continent, near the Salo Tau Ata Apik Pan Valley (transliteration), are the French-renowned "Devil's Island," the infamous name of the most terrifying and cruel prison solely for incarcerating international and major offenders. Former Captain Terry Fivees was unjustly imprisoned on "Devil's Island" for ten years due to unfounded military conspiracy charges. After his release, a famous French writer wrote a book about his story, which became popular in various countries. Columbia Pictures Corporation has now purchased the rights to adapt it into a film, titled "Escape from Devil's Island," starring the big stars Victor Zorelle, Norman Foster, and the famous actress Florentine Lai. The plot is extremely tense, revealing the suffering of prisoners on the island, showing the inhumane acts of torture and flogging to death. In this film, three prisoners boldly attempt to escape, resulting in shooting and deaths. Although two escape, they are filled with terror and suffer greatly. Simultaneously, love brings about changes, ultimately leading to a resolution where one person willingly sacrifices their own freedom, content to suffer on "Devil's Island," allowing the two lovers to be together. In summary, the value of this film is evident. It is said that the Shanghai Grand Theater has acquired it and will present it to the people of Shanghai in the near future, at which time it will undoubtedly receive high praise from various newspapers.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since there's been a comedy film in the domestic film industry. "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" uses the most famous comedy stars on the Chinese silver screen, Han Langen and Liu Jiqun, in the lead roles. This is really great news for movie fans, and what makes everyone even happier is that "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" is showing excellent results. According to those who have seen the unofficial preview of the film, no one can hold back their laughter. These two lively ghosts are active everywhere. Viewers already show a smile when they see their shadows, and they can't help but burst into laughter when they use all their tricks.</p>
<p>During the filming period of "Peach Blossom Spring Dream," Xinhua Company expanded greatly, so it was even more powerful in terms of technical talent. The scenery was designed with Zhang Yunqiao's ingenious psychology. There is a Peach Blossom Spring scene, which covers the twelve acres of Xinhua's new photography studio so tightly that no air can pass through. The entire mountain scene is as high as a three-story Western-style building, so you can already see the mountain peak clearly when you look from the Xu Jia Hui triangle area. Some people were surprised, how can a mountain peak be found in Shanghai? Walking closer and seeing it a mile away, it turns out that it is a large set in the new photography studio of Xinhua Company. This set is already very sensational in the Xu Jia Hui area now, before the film has been released.</p>
