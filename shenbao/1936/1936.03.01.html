<h3 id="c15">法衆院核準法蘇互助恊定 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 宣</p>
<p>歐洲集體安全運動自去年六月英德海軍協定締結以來本已漸趨黯澹但上月間經歐洲各國外交家之努力又有顯著之發展最近法衆院之核准法蘇互助協定其最可注意之例證也</p>
<p>法蘇互助協定乃蘇捷蘇羅互助協定之產母足以造成包含軍隊二千七百萬人之對德聯合陣綫而使德國陷于孤立地位其遭希特勒之劇烈反對固勢所必至者德國政府方面對于此項協定現已發表聲明認爲違反羅加諾公約査協定條文互助範圍僅以兩國之一在歐洲方面被侵略時爲限而羅加諾公的之主要內容則爲以和平方法解决德國與其鄰近法比波捷諸國之一切爭議及英法意比德五國互相保證德比與德法間之界錢絕對不得侵犯兩點比兩公的之精神顯不相反而相成且去年五月間法國與蘇聯簽訂互助協定時曾諮詢英意兩國政府意見英意政府均表同意以爲並未與羅加諾公的相牴觸今者德國堅執兩的牴觸一點以圖破壞法蘇互助協定殊不無深意可尋也</p>
<p>德元首希特勒上年宜佈重整軍備後曾在國會發表外交方針十三項其中關於羅加諾公的者有云「……由羅加諾公的所產生之各項義務倘爲其他簽的國所遵守則德國亦必尊重之就來因河撤廢軍備區域而言德國亦必尊重此爲對德國所加最重大之負擔然法國則屢在邊境集中軍隊迄未停止此層務須注意」云云希特勒於此雖表示其尊重羅加諾公的然亦以法國態度爲言留活動餘地近日電訊傳來德國在來因河區域之軍事布置頗爲積極且有準備在撤廢軍備區域駐兵之說是則德國殆欲借法蘇協定爲口實使羅加諾公的成爲廢紙歟</p>
<p>羅加諾公的之破壊勢將引起歐洲大陸之戰禍此乃一般人所引爲焦慮者然而國社黨統治之德國縱有軍事冒險之决心要亦不能不就國際環境作合理之考量法蘇互助協定之所以成爲集體安全重要之一環其意義卽在於此</p>

<p>— 中央大學地理系敎授　黃國璋</p>
<p>由上面所講的看來，我們可以知道日本一切的對華關係都有牠特殊的地理背景，我們欲想對於日本的國際關係有一個相當的了解，首先須得對於日本地理有一個相當的了解。這是專就日本一國而言，推而至其他各國的情形大都也是一樣。國際間的情勢雖然變幻無常，但究其根源莫不有他地理的因素，英國所以帮助阿比西尼亞以抗意，一方面是爲保全到遠東的航路，一方面是爲保全尼羅河上流的水源以免埈及境內尼羅河下流沿岸的農業受其戚襲，而意大利立國於半島之上，除了北部沙河流域以外，其餘不是山地，就是瘠土，鑛源旣感缺乏，原料生產又極稀少，仰給於外國輸入的極多，所以侵阿戰爭，惹起國際聯盟會員國中三十八國的經濟絕交，雖然這種經濟制裁案的實行至今不到二個月，但意大利國內所感受的痛苦已是十分深切，百物騰貴巳成爲極普遍的現象，日常用品都厲行緊縮，原來吃三餐的現在改吃二餐，政府機關將辦公時間縮短，商店也將營業時間縮短，各家戶的電梯大都棄而不用，電車也將减少班决，目的就在節省電力；公共汽車也將暫時停開以節省石油，政府極端鼓勵徒步往來，其他一切的情形可想而知。由此更可以證明現在國際間的關係的密切，允其在經濟方面全世界已是成了整個的單元，無論任何國家都不能孤獨的存在，而外國地理知職的重要更是不言而喻了。</p>
<p>學習外國地理的第二個原因，是可以明瞭中國在國際問所處的地位。一國的國際地位與立國的三個要件有深切的關係，就是土地，人民，與人民共有的國家觀念。所謂土地是包括土地所有權，土地面積的大小，土地的生產力，地下的天富，天然的防護，內部各地的天然溝通，對外的天然聯絡，以及土地在地面上所處的位置等項這些都是地理上必須　到的問題：所謂人民，是包括人民數目的多少，人民利用自然能力的大小（敎育程度以及經濟建設事業之進行等），人民購買力的大小（市場的大小及工資的貴賤等），人民的天性（服從，畏怯，剛毅，果斷等），以及人民所屬的種族等項，這些，也都是地理上必須講到的；至於人民共有的國家觀念，更是人民與土地相互關係的產品，因爲無論那個國家的人民，他們日常所需要的生活資料，最大部分總是由於他們利用本國的土地所得來，他們對於自已所在國家的土地認識最深，關心最切，由這種深切的認識與關懷，才能喚起一種共同的國家觀念。</p>
<p>良好的政府可以促進全國人民與全國土地的相互關係。個人的力量有限，不能事事單獨的與自然相周旋，如水利的改善，交通的改良，種子畜類的改良與選擇，產物的推銷以及其他許多類似的問題，都是要靠多數人民的合作，並且還要有良好的政府爲人民去通盤籌劃，督率推進和盡力保護，方能達到地盡其利，人盡其用的目的。並且人民生活所需，决不楚本鄕本土所能全部供給，除了由國外供給一部分外，最大部分是取諸國土以內的其他各地，可以由經濟組織方面講來一個國家實在是一僩整個的經濟單元，如果單靠人民各個人的力量而沒有良好的政府去運用全國人民的力量與自然各方面相周旋，何能便全國人民對於全國土地得到適當的利用，而收取互相補益的效果？更何能使得全國人民對於全國各個部分發生一種息息相關，不可分離的感覺，因而養成一種共同的國家觀念，所以一個良好的政府的一切設施，無論對內對外，都應當以增加人民利用土地的力量，藉以改良人民的生活狀况爲目的，因此我可以說，共同的國家觀念，是由人民與土地的相互關係上發生，而良的政府是足以促進人民與土地的相互關係的。</p>
<p>古人云：「知已知彼，百戰百勝」。立國於現在這種錯綜複雜的國際情勢之下，允貴有知已知彼之明，掌握政權的人，固然要了解國家土地人民，在國際間所處的地位，以及人民共同國家觀念發展的程度，就是一般人民對此也應該有相當的了解。本國地理注重知已，外國地理注重知彼但在知彼之餘，對於自己了解得更是深切。本國在國際間所處的地位，要在明瞭外國地理之後，才可以反映得出來，國家的對外政策，才有一定的目標。現在以中美兩國作一個比較，以見兩國在國際上的重要性。</p>
<p>中美兩國相同的地方很多，最重要的有八點：　兩國位於同樣的緯度。　兩國海岸綫都是很長，且都有良好的港灣與各地取得便易的聯絡。　兩國都有適於農業的大江流域，同爲世界主耍的農業國家。　兩國都是糧食可以自給的國家。　兩國都是農物出口的國家。　兩國都有豐富的鑛藏，足資重工業的發展。　兩國都富有人力。　兩國都富有自然水力。</p>
<p>至於兩國不同的地方，可分爲兩方面說明；（甲）中國超過美國方面：　中國面積大過美國爲四：三與三·七之比。　中國人口多過美國三倍有餘，爲四五與一·叫之比。　中國農民多過美國八倍至丸倍　中國主要農物之產量多於美國的，有稻米，大豆，高粱，小米等項。　中國鑛產多於美國的有銻·鎢·錫等項。　中國的自然防範形勢，西北有高山，有沙漠，有高原，東南濱海，層層保障爲美國爲優良。（乙）美國超過中國的方面：　天國耕地面積犬於中國二分之一倍。　美國平均每農戶所得耕地而積大於中國四十倍。　美國主要農作物多於中國的，有小麥，棉花，烟草，玉米等項。　美國的鑛產，如煤多於中國二十倍，生鐵多於中國五十倍，石油，銅鑛相去更多。　美國工廠工人，多於中國的十倍。　美國鐵道哩數，多於中國二十倍以上。　美國汽車道里數，多於中國五十倍。　美國海輪噸數，多於中國五倍　美國紡織錠數，多於中國九倍。　美國紡織機數，多於中國二十一倍。　　美國對外出口貿易額，多於中國九倍；入口貿易額，多於中國五倍。　　美國每人平均對外貿易額，多於中國二十倍。</p>
<p>從這樣簡單的比較，我們就可以看出中美兩國在國際間所居地位的重耍性，同時還可以看出中美兩國在自然環境方面的各種條件上相差不遠，並且大致極其相似，兩國相差最大的地方，幾乎都在人的方面，換句話說：中國之地有利，但中國人却不像美國人那樣能用其利，至使中美兩國在國際間所處的地位大相懸殊。他如中英·中法·中德·中日·中俄以及中國與世界其他各國的國際地位之比較又是怎樣呢？當然也惟有學習外國地理才可以看得出來</p>
<p>這種比較，不專是露出我國的弱點，同時也可以表示我國的優點，例如我國人口之衆爲世界各國之冠，我們就可以利用道個優點，來提高我國在國際間的地位。我們祗耍利用科學新發明來開發本國的富源，發展各種的產業，使得全國四萬五千萬人每人每年平均能多出產一塊錢的貨物，就可以增加世界上價値四萬五千萬元的人類生活資料；同時每人每年平均能多買塊錢的貨物，就可以增加世界上價値四萬五千萬的購買力量；合而言之，就等於增加世界上幾萬萬兀的貿易總額，把這個數目分配到全世界二十萬萬人口，每人平均可得四角五分。我們的生產力與購買力愈增高，影響於國際市場者愈大。此外我國還有許多特有的鑛產如銻鑛，鎢鑛是；還有許多在世界市場上占有十分優越地位的農產如桐油，大豆，生絲，　花，茶葉，花生等是；祇要我們能够利用廉價的勞工，增加物品的產量，改良物品的品質，我國在在國際舞臺上的地位一定可以提高。（未完）</p>

<p>巳倒閉美豐銀行總經理德國人葛雷福、被訴私將存戶託為保管之現金、擅改為通知存欵、致存戶遭受損失一案、業經第一特區地方法院錢鴻業刑庭長傳集被吿及一干入瞪三度開庭、將事實審究明晰、</p>
<p>事實已明開始辯論</p>
<p>昨晨十時、乃命雙方律師、在第一法庭、為言詞辯論、先由起訴之工部局律師博良汝葆彝兩律師、一操英語、一為繙譯、陳述被吿應負罪責之理由、歷一時許始畢、大旨略謂美豐之倒閉、宛如演一幕傀儡劇、該行買辦黃逸材、保管部主任朱有松、皆屬扮演之傀儡、被吿葛雷福、則為幕後牽錢之主角、劇名可稱之日「美豐銀行之失敗」、考其失敗原因、旣非關乎市面不景氣、復不含蓄其他問題、純由於被吿之詐欺侵占背信所致、美豐並未向中國政府註冊、</p>
<p>合夥性質總理負責</p>
<p>祗能認其係合夥性質、總經理當負完全責任、對於該行一切行為、殊不能以不知情而諉卸、起訴方面所須證明者、　被吿是吾為總經理、　有無非法行為、　美豐已吾因此非法行為、得有不法利益、今此三點、皆已確切證明、復經楊錫卿到案詳述彼與買辦黃逸材接洽保管兩萬現金之經過、黃逸材朱有松所供、亦與楊相符反證楊黃朱之言為虛偽、則吿與黃原甚投契、自本案發當庭對黃攻擊、惟此種犯罪於黃、則被吿應早窺破、不雷文之到庭作證、為被吿所提出、</p>
<p>雷文氏應負侵佔罪</p>
<p>雷文才識誠優、彼能以無條件透支該行鉅欵、擲　與投機事業、是其人之品行、可以推知且其職司保管、寗有不親見兩萬現金、而貿然簽字於收據之理、若科其責任、亦難逃業務侵占之罪、况該行定章、行員不能開透支戶名、彼嘗　黃逸材行為非法、但彼自身之罪、實浮於黃、故雷文之證言、允不足取、</p>
<p>放欵過鉅不合行規</p>
<p>該行規定放欵、不得超過資本十分之一查其資本為二百五十萬、而放與赫金公司一戶、已達二百五十萬、全部資金罄盡、乃尙有放與普益公司一百十六萬、此外數十萬之戶、亦屬不尠、稽其濫放之故、則因雷文為赫金公司董事長、其他債務人如普益等、俱與有密切關係、遂不復顧及銀行本身之受害、</p>
<p>中美法律俱屬不合</p>
<p>又如黃逸材欠欵十餘萬、而其保證品、則為本行之股票、此點無論就中國抑美國法律、俱屬不合該行不但任雷文予取予求、凡屬雷文之親戚、亦多任透支、不啻以美豐為雷文之私產、被告亦嘗經營投機、其所以不欠而反有二萬七千元存於該行者、實得力於該行之經濟週轉、有此後盾、故克反敗為勝、今其存欵雖亦被倒、然所得足償所失、自本案發生、被吿深知不利、曾挽黃與楊和解、以為將欵還楊、當能撤銷訟案、茲已附帶民訴、如判被吿負償還之責、則淸理處、可以少受損失、</p>
<p>霍夫之言不無偏袒</p>
<p>惟淸理員霍夫所述證言、不無偏袒被吿、代為洗刷之語、實有越出職權、並且背信之嫌、應請予以注意、該行倒閉之後、有一存戶自殺、其遺書內云、因畢生心血所積、悉化烏有、以故憂忿輕生、此類家破人亡之慘案、實由該行所釀成、被吿身為總經理、誠應戶其咎而置之於法也云云、</p>
<p>被告辯護共有三人</p>
<p>繼由被吿之律師辯護、為其辯護者、共有三人、遂先由陳霆銳律師陳述、謂捕房辦理本案、自偵查十七以至辯論十七、屢放煙幕彈、故使空氣緊張而濃厚、美豐倒後、因受影響而傾家者、而身死者、斯誠極不幸之事、但行倒爲一事、被告犯罪與否爲一事、不能以其係已倒銀行之制總經理、卽須負全般責任、</p>
<p>銀行失敗屢見不鮮</p>
<p>况比年以來、銀行失敗者、屢見不鮮、從未聞歸咎行長一人、至美按察署懲辦雷文白郞、則是雷白有可得之罪、被吿與雷白地位不同、案情有別、捕房不能據雷白以為例、而援引比附、至謂被吿曾有命黃逸材與楊錫卿和解之意、卽認被吿為畏罪舉動、此允揣測之詞、要不足信、今對於本案事實、卽現金保管、變為通知存欵一點、誠為雙方所不爭、其應需研究者、僅被吿對此事應吾負責之問題、捕房以被吿身為總經理、變更存欽名義、當然知之、</p>
<p>範圍甚廣未免苛求</p>
<p>要知美豐範圍甚廣、職員近百、欵項出入、日在五千萬左右、被告勢難鉅細躬親、設其屬員有不法行為、須主腦負責、未免苛求、況刑法規定、不事株連、雖古代有一人犯罪、波及全家之法、然非語於現代矣、苟捕房能於書證物證入證方面、證朋被吿確曾參預犯罪行為者、則被吿當任其咎、然其所提出之照片簿冊、通知存欵之收據、楊依兩人所執之收據、無一而經被吿簽字、</p>
<p>黃朱之言寗復可信</p>
<p>至證人之言、除楊錫卿所述事實外、黃逸材朱有松、則係一鼻孔出氣之流、蓋黃充美豐買辦、所訂之合同、由朱為見證、而朱又欠黃欵五千元之多、彼兩人之關係、自非泛泛、朱得不為黃之應聲蟲耶、黃旣獲得不法利益、欲將罪責諉諸被吿、故此種證言、寗復可信、黃每藉口彼因合同規定、須服從總經理命令、但合同載明所謂服從者、乃合法命令、私改存欵名義、豈合法行為乎、且去年四月八日買辦間之賬、業已查明、是日所存之數、增加兩萬、此當係楊錫卿交付之兩萬現金、似無疑義、</p>
<p>存欵易名如法泡製</p>
<p>嗣黃見將楊欵改易名義、尙屬順利、故對依下德之保管欵項、遂仍着朱如法泡製、朱雖未曾得利、但彼為黃之債務人、當然奉命唯謹、淸理員霍夫、固已眞知灼見、故其到庭作公平之證言、絕無袒護被告之處、總之被吿旣非不法行為人、不法利益、復非銀行所得、應不負何種罪責云云、時已至午、錢庭長遂諭改期下禮拜一再訊、被吿葛雷福、仍交原保出外、</p>

<p>— 胡一臧</p>
<p>自從二大財閥聯合提携以後，不料銀價低落，通貨膨脹的結果，又值各國對華投資旺盛時期，於是乘機以地產金融房產等為主，積極進行，如瓦斯自來水等公益事業，竟可獲二分以上的純利，一躍而成為今日的鉅富，具有絕大的勢力了。</p>
<p>現安諾德任上海公共租界工部局市參事會議長，掌握上海市政的樞機，沙遜財閥的領袖維克太沙遜，去年為中國通貨不安對策，曾主張「上海鎊制」他是猶太系的英國紳士，今已六十餘歲，他對於世界的事業，頗具卓見，在這二大財閥的直系或傍系下，受其支配的，有銀行、建築物、信託、投資、瓦斯、貿易、海陸運輸、保險、等二十餘公司，特對於土地建築物中，所謂沙遜大廈，（上海唯一的華懋飯店Calhey　hotel）漢彌敦大廈，（Hamilton　house）均為這財閥的建築物，沙遜銀公司，其資本雖不過百萬鎊，可是他又左右上海匯兌金塊市場的大勢力，查這二財閥，投資於上海的總額，約在一億五六千萬元，自中國恢復國權運動發生，因關稅目主，於是關稅收入的保管，從匯豐銀行，移至中央銀行，最近又因世界不景氣，銀價激變，中國內地民衆購買力的減退，以及因日本政治經濟全部的膨脹飛躍，英國經濟勢力，逐受重大的脅迫，即日本的政治經濟活躍，與英國對華政策，根本上發生的衝突，譬如滿洲與上海二大地點，滿洲已得了日本的支持，而且將由華北，及於華南，上海已受日本勢力的壓迫，於是英國原有地勢力，漸次銷沉，就最近日英貿易情形而言，日本已凌駕英國之上，如去年與前年上海　的日英貿易相對照，可以明白日本勢力的伸張了。（未完）</p>

<p>七對二優游獲勝，易地再戰，優游氣燄甚熾，許文奎過關斬將，銳不可當，奚巧生助紂爲虐，沿路勢如破竹，進邇東華內地，巧在十五碼處力射，關澢安一時失措，陣地立陷，王章賓看得眼紅，大刀闊斧，匹馬深入，轉傳中央，奚巧生斜里竄出，再告命中，許文奎崛起中軍，對門力射，惜中門柱彈回，惠培再接再厲，帶球闖門，澢安不慌不忙，振臂揮出，文奎奔上，踢中綱角，惜惠培越位作廢，放雍源無聲無色，起義邊體，與巧生狼狽爲奸，連袂進兵，雍源立傳㣕軍門前，巧生枕戈以待，三陷東華陣地，巧生爲報效起見，與雍源搭擋，運球前進，連三東華三道防線，薛雍源見機可趁，拔腳攻門，關澢安不該奔出，就致命中，雍源再度失兵犯境，又建功而返，俄而時間告終，雙方息戈收軍，優游以七對二淘汰東華，獲得字林盃複賽權，下週將與蘭開夏爭奪決賽權。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott　原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>第十章　感謝</p>
<p>這周年一度的感謝節在梅莊部是按照古老好生慶祝，從汪間斷。好幾天以前，小女孩們在食物儲藏間和廚房裏助亞西和蜀夫人做各種糕餅，揀選果肉，刷抹碟子等，都是很忙，而且自覺是十分重要的人物。男孩子們徘徊在那禁地的邊疆，嗅那種香噴噴的味道，　窺那些秘密的工作間或也得　味一點猶在製作中的珍品。</p>
<p>今年裏彷彿有爲往年所沒有的一件什麽事在進行着，因爲小孩子們樓上樓下都是栗碌得很，男孩子們在課室和倉庫裏也是忙個不體，一般忙碌的空氣竟充滿了全屋子。他們在傾筐倒篋，蒐羅老舊的緞帶和花邊等類細巧的織品，並且有極大數量的草瓣，棉花，佛蘭絨，以及大烏珠，備拂朗和恂夫人之用。仙達在工場裏丁丁地盡向那些奇怪的機器上去作工，小橋和韜摩儀各自對他們自己喃喃不休，好像是要強記什麽東西，有時聽得愛彌房發出一種可怖的的響聲，又有時當蜀夫人等要了羅勃和坦第去，幾個鍾頭不見他們的時候，我們又聽見從育兒室裏發出陣陣的笑聲。可是最使裴先生疑惑不解的是羅勃的大南瓜到那裏去了。這確是高高興償送進了廚房裏去，不久便出現了一打淡黃色的餅。可是這消不去了那巨瓜的四分之一，其餘到那兒去了呢？這卻總是個不見了，羅渤倒也似乎不在意，有人談及的時候只是笑着，要他的父親「等待看着」，因爲這全部的玩意兒是要在最後使裴伯伯大吃一驚，是不要使他預選知道一點點的。</p>

<h3 id="c217">從明代文學講到公安竟陵 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 佩韋</p>
<p>明朝從永樂以後到弘治初年，因為經過的是一個比較長期的太平時代、農村經濟穩定，政治也上了軌道，所以廟堂文學極盛一時，三楊的臺閣體就代表了這一個時代。弘治正德以後，西北被寇患，權奄專朝政，太平時代已成過去，一般人對於廟堂文學漸起反感，就有前後七子的復古運動。復古派摹倣秦漢做假古文，講些治國平天下的大道理，這是因為時局還沒有弄到不可收拾的地步，所以他們還能擺架子，說空話。到了後來，政治愈弄愈糟，農村經濟快要破產了，士大夫們不滿意於目前政治狀况，一時叉想不出補救的方法。索性不在文章裏面擺架子，不　治國平天下的大道理，於是「獨抒性靈，不拘格套」的公安派和有意把文章做得使人難懂的竟陵派先後起米。但從天啟以後，一直到明亡，士大夫受的刺戟太深，已有許多人反對「獨行性靈」，而發為慷慨悲歌之作。南都以後，更多繁霜板蕩之詩，禾黍麥秀之篇，悲感悽惋，與所謂「淸新輕俊」或「幽深孤峭」者完全不同了。到了淸初，就是號稱集公安竟陵之大成的張岱（宗子），他的文章的內容。結構。風格，都和公安竟陵不同，我們只要拿他的作品和三袁及鍾譚的作品一比較，就會知道。</p>
<p>從明代文學的演變過程中看，公安竟陵不過是對於復古派的一時的反動，它們的發生。成長·沒落，時期很短，影響不怎麼大。到了最近，公安竟陵的名稱又常常被人提起，三袁和鍾譚的詩文集又在市塲流行，編文學史的講到了明代文學，也得把公安竟陵特別講得週到纔不會被人指摘。三袁鍾譚在三百年後忽然交到這樣紅運，眞是意想不到之事。然而這樣的時代，這樣的國家，是不是應該提倡這一派的文學呢？</p>
<h3 id="c218">兒童讀物的選擇 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 味之</p>
<p>我們要選擇兒童讀物，須得定下凡個標準。如果沒有標準，「拉在籃裏就是菜，」隨便給兒童一些讀物，那未必對兒童定有好處，也許比不給他們什麼讀物還要壤呢。</p>
<p>第一，意思要正當。這並不是說烏言獸語之類的東西不能給他們讀。鳥言獸語只是形式上的事情，我們要特別留意的是讀物的內容。凡寫一篇東西，無論好的壞的，必然有作者所認為中心的內容，這個我們叫牠做意思。意思正當的，就是採用烏言獸語的形式的也不妨讀。吾則就是完全人言人語也不可讀。正當不正當又從什麼地方去辨別呢？只須想：讀者是中國的兒童，是現代中國的兒童，合乎現代中國兒童的需要的就是正當的。反過來，就是不正當的。據例來說：合乎物理原則的是正當的，含有迷信思想的是不正常的。發揮集團精神的是正當的，鼓吹封建遺毒的是不正常的。——依此類推，可以舉出許多，這里不必細說。</p>
<p>第二，文字要通順。這個標準有點奇怪，寫成了兒童讀物，印上了紙面，文字還有不通順的嗎？依理想來，常然不會有的了。可是現在流行的兒童讀物，無論是編撰的或是翻譯的，往往有不乾不凈，前不搭後，生硬難讀的文句。這些毛病總包括說就是不通順。旣然事實上確然有不通順的兒童讀物，我們選擇的時候就得注意，要把牠們排除開去。兒童閱讀兒童讀物，同時就在　鍊他的語言習慣。若是把這種不通順的文字作為語言的模範，將使他不能够好好地說一番話，漸漸地將使他不能够有條有理地轉一個念頭。這個影響並不是輕微的啊。</p>
<p>第三，如果是詩歌，必須像固詩歌。油腔滑調不是詩歌。隨口趁韻也不是詩歌。如果有圖畫，必須像張圖畫。畫什麼不像什麼當然不是圖畫。像了什麼而死板沒有生氣也還算不得圖畫。凡把不像樣的東西給兒童看，足以阻遏兒童對於那一類東西的興趣，實在是一種虐待。詩歌和圖畫最為兒童所喜愛，對於兒童的啓發也最有幫助。所以選擇的時候必順特別留意，要排斥那些不像樣的，留下那些像樣的。</p>

<p>一全書編次，悉依列史前後為序，區分若干部。每一部分，先表後志，以類相從。著錄請書，亦略詮作者時代之决，藉成條貫。其有專述偏方割據之政制更革及域外諸族之動態者，則別置各部之末，以淸眉目，如練恕之西秦百官表及沈維賢之兩漢匈奴表與晉日五胡表等是。</p>

<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>－巴金短篇小說集後記－</p>
<p>我開始寫文章，到現在也有好幾年了。這幾年中間究竟寫了些什麼東西，我自己有時候也算不淸楚這一筆糊塗帳。想起來，我寫的文章，有的隨寫隨棄，有的發表後連自己也沒注意就看不見了。其中流傳到現在的，還是幾篇小說。</p>
<p>這裏用了「流傳」兩字，自己看來也覺斬鬼够「流傳」的，不見得就是好東西。雖然在今天時髦的書店老闆已經能够談什麼「文化的立塲」以一版再版乃至四版五版的。所以我底書可以流傳到現在，並不是什麼光榮的事附。</p>
<p>我對於自己底作品並不滿意。有寺我固然也愛惜牠們，但有時我也討厭牠們。而且有件事情却是永遠不變的：我每次翻閱到自已寫的東西，總不免要提筆胡亂地刪改一番。似乎到處都有毛病，不改心裏就不痛快。據一位英　的第三流批評家說，一篇好文章是不能够隨意被刪改的。連增减一個字也不行。　這里也可以看見我底文章是不成東西的了。</p>
<p>話雖然是如此說，但我還是沒有　氣把我底不成東西的文章毀掉，也就糊裏糊塗地讓牠們一版再版地印下去。我並不想賺錢，但也從不曾打過文化招牌。我一生就充滿了矛盾。譬如，我不滿意自己底文章，但同時又不甘心那些更不成東西的讀物老是在讀者中間賣來賣去。所以我也高興讓我底作品和牠們搶一搶生意。</p>
<p>以前我忙着寫文章。近一年來我發明了（？）「擱筆」兩字來敷衍各位大編輯，所以有了讀書的時間。有時候也讀自己寫的東西，便費了一點工夫把舊作整理一下。其結果我編了兩册短篇集，把我底全部短篇小說都包括在裏面。另外附了一篇寫作生活底回顧在前面，這是一篇舊作，但增加了新的材料。倘使有讀者讀我底小說不能理解，那麼寫作生活底回顧就可以給他幫忙。但是如果他讀後仍不能理解，那麼他就率性不要再讀，或者勸人不要讀。這是最痛快的辦法。</p>
<p>編者按：巴金短篇小說集第二集現正在排印中，不久仍將由開明書店出版。</p>

<p>近年來坊肆閒護物雖然很多，然而大多數是些幽默小品，或者者是翻印古書。我們的眼光看，在這科學知識飢荒的時代，版物裨益於一般靑年學子的地方，實在甚至於一個有志氣的靑年，因為受够了的麻醉，消極或墮落也不少。由另一方說，各書店也有不少的科學書籍出版，有的當然太專門，不是一般人可以看得懂的；有的是學校的敎科書，不合於一般人的口胃。求共旣能描叙科學事實，又帶文學意味的作品，實在太少。本書作者素以善寫科學小品文字見稱，書中共收生物論文二十一篇，名為生物素描，用文藝筆墨，描叙科學理論，使讀者能有文藝欣賞，同時又得着科學知識，輕描淡寫，淺入深出，極具情趣。有時引用古人詩句，使讀者不覺枯燥，而得文學的薰陶。又每篇均有插圖，可增科學美感。一般煩悶靑年讀之，當然可當作正當消遣，得到相當好處，增加不少常識。再就普化科學知識說，這也是一種最好不過的入門方法。我們再就科學立場說，我國一設讀書界的需要，現在不是那許多的「幽默」「漫談」，而是文理兼擅的怡情益智的科學作品。賈先生本書出版，我們極端贊成，希望能因此大開風氣，一新讀書界之趨向。同時更希望其他天文物理化學地理各科能文邃理之士，能以餘暇的工夫，作同樣的貢獻。本書格式，印刷，用紙均佳。實價四角，似嫌稍貴。（載科學二十卷二期，頁一五二，一五三）</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「新少年」創刋號出版後，受到誠者盛大的歡迎，印數由五萬增加到八萬，由八萬增加到十萬，仍舊不够分配，實在是我們常初所沒有想到的。我們受到這種分外的光榮，自然只有加倍努力，來答謝愛護我們的十萬讀者。但是我們自知能力薄弱，見聞不周，我們所貢獻給新少年的，一定還有許多應該補充或改進的地方。所以我們在一月十六日出版的第二期「讀書俱樂部」上，登了一個微文啟事，規定了（一）讀「新少年」創刋號，（二）我所希望於「新少年」者的兩個題目，微求讀者給與我們指導和批評，作為以後編輯上的南針。截至二月十日止，我們居然收到十四篇應徵的文字。其中用第一題寫的計八篇，各篇內容，獎勵的多，指導的少。用第二題寫的計六篇，各篇都提出了幾點意見和要求。</p>
<p>現在把這些文章整理一下，歸納一下，報吿在下面：</p>
<p>一，希望把「文藝」「社會科學」「自然科學」的量平均分配。</p>
<p>二，希望多登各種學科的研究方法。</p>
<p>三，希望對於當前的時事動向，多加以精細的分析與研究。</p>
<p>四，灌輸相當的「救亡圖存」之要義，愛國主張。</p>
<p>五，希望登載點關於職業的文字。</p>
<p>六，多登些時事照片·漫晝·挿畫。</p>
<p>七，耍注意全部少年（生活在各種不同環境中的）的需要。</p>
<p>八，對各門智識要盡力介紹或創作最有價値最前線的東西。</p>
<p>九，側重實際性的事物作材料，不着邊際的高談闊論母寗割愛。</p>
<p>十，文字注意大衆化。</p>
<p>十一，文少宜力求新颕及趣味化。</p>
<p>十二，請闢少年問答欄，答覆讀者的一切疑難問題。</p>
<p>十三，盡量接收投稿和常常微文，以鼓勵和指導讀者寫作。</p>
<p>十四，希望全都用五號字排版，可增加些篇幅。</p>
<p>十五，最好改為周刋或旬刊，不致隔了半月才見面。</p>
<p>十六，希望多諸各科專家撰述。</p>
<p>十七，希望保持創刊號的精采，而精益求精。</p>
<p>這里讓我們把讀者所指示的一十七點，分為三類來給讀者一個簡要的答覆：</p>
<p>第一類是我們已經實行了的，如（一）（三）（四）（六）（八）（九）（十）（十一）（十四）（十六）（十七）各點，這些只要請讀者看一看第二三四期的本誌就可明白。第二類是我們正在計划中的，如（二）（五）（七）（十三）各點，第三類是我們覺得一時不能實行的，那只有（十二）（十五）兩點。這兩點的不能實行，完全是人力的問題。（十二）是希望我們闢一個問答欄。據我們過去的經騐，覺得雜誌上一有了問答攔，投函詢問的一定非常之多，結果，能够登載出來的實在不過十分之一二；要一一答覆，固然非篇幅和人力所能許可，可是問而不答，叫讀者空花掉幾分郵費，我們覺得也有點說不過去。（十五）是希望把牠改為週刋或旬刋，這也是一個人力的問題，而且週刋或旬刊的篇幅總不能太多，因為篇幅多了，無形中就加重了讀者負担，若是减少篇幅，則牠是否還能保持原來的面目，就很難說了。</p>

<p>— 江蘇海門縣立明誠小學黃雅芳</p>
<p>「我將來做怎樣的人？」這誠然是一個十分重要的問題。近幾天來，我為了答復它，費了好幾天的時光，才想出一個最後的答案來。我雖是小學的女生，現在沒有什麼志願，沒有什麼責任，但將來呢，我總是國民的一份子，對家庭至少要做賢妻良母，對國家當然耍盡我最大的義務；照這樣說，我不能為了年小，而沒有做人的目標。現代的女子，不能和古時的女子來比，古時的女子，能做賢妻良母就算盡了一生的責任，好像和國家社會，沒有什麼關係的。現在呢，女子除了家庭以外，還要負一部分救國的義務。我們中國危弱到這個地步，固然男子應當用全副精神救國，而我們女子豈能忘掉救國的工作呢？譬如我國一旦要和敵人開戰，男子上了前綫，後方工作，便是我們女子的職務了。有時前綫需要救護的護士，我們又得趕上前綫去服務。我常聽得老師們說：「女子在平時，只在家裏工作，戰時便和男子一樣的要上戰綫。」啊！我們應該這樣做人，才是現代的女子？我又想：賢妻良母，决不是對待丈夫好。子女好的說法，要在使一個家庭，和和氣氣，都能勤儉耐勞，造成快樂的家庭，個人才有幸福，個個家庭能做得好，社會國家才有希望。以上這些話，便是我將來做人的目標。</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>社會上司一種警戒使命的東西，有警鐘警笛一類的物件，現在我們從故書堆裏又尋到一件警枕的事實，特寫在下面：</p>
<p>宋朝司馬溫公，是有朱一代著名的大儒，他在求學時代，深慮學問不得成功，平時深居簡出，用功讀書，特製一圓形木枕，頭著於上，稍動則枕滾，雖深睡時必定驚覺，因號為警枕。公於讀書疲倦時，雖入睡，但藉圓枕警戒，警覺後復又攻讀，如此每日如是，動讀不輟，後來就成為大儒，公之享盛名於後世，委實不是一件容易的事啊！</p>
<p>全國小朋友！你們現在大都總是在求學時代，當這「讀書不忘救國，救國不忘讀書，」國難最嚴重的時期，你們觀於司馬溫公警枕的事實，必定有動於中，我望你們奮然興起，從此刻苦讀書，造就有用人材，以便將來好替國家出力。</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>玩雪球，在冬季是敏兒最喜歡的遊戲。所以一到了下雪的時候，他就很早的到學校裏去了。但他最討厭的溶雪，地上難走得很，並且氣候又是很冷，他覺得很奇怪，所以他放學回到家裏就去問他的爸爸：</p>
<p>「爸，你可知道溶雪的時候為什麼比正在下雪的時侯冷得多？」</p>
<p>「你要知道溶雪的時候為什麼冷？那麼先要知道雪在凝固時的氣侯，是冷還是不冷？我說雪在凝固時比在溶雪時，不冷得多，因為一樣液體要凝結成固體的時候，必須耍放出熱，這是什麼道理」？</p>
<p>於是他的爸爸拿了一根玻璃管和一隻杯子，在玻璃管裏放了一半的水，在杯裏放了些冰和鹽，他把玻璃管放在冰和鹽的中間，更拿了一隻寒署表，先放在玻璃管裏，就看見水的溫度降到了零度，水就漸漸的凝結成冰。他的爸爸開口說道：</p>
<p>「當水在凝固時的溫度是停留在零度，不會改變，直到了水完全結成了冰，冰的溫度，方始再降低，從此可知水在凝固時，不會降到零度，因為一面它正在放熱哩。」</p>
<p>「至於融解，怎麼會冷。雪在融解時，必須吸收熱，才能融解，你只要去拿剛才的那隻杯子，裏面放了冰，加熱，同時把寒暑表來測量它的溫度，雪的溫度，起初加熱，到了零度，就不再升高，直到了雪完全融解成水的時候，水的溫度才漸漸的昇高，你自已試騐好了」。</p>
<p>「爸，固體融解成液體的時侯，要多少熱度？」</p>
<p>「這問題很複雜，我稍吿訴你一些。一克的泳，在零度時融化成零度的水，必須要吸收八十卡路里的熱度。甚麼呌做卡路里？一克水昇高溫度一度時，所需要的熱，作為量的熱單位，這呌做卡路里。」</p>

<p>猴子戲</p>
<p>空塲上，許多小孩子圍成一個圈子，看着猴子做戲。那猴子一忽兒戴着黃金色的皇冠，扮着古代的皇帝。一忽兒嘡啷嘡啷地掛着指揮刀，扮做現代的將軍；因為他做戲做得太認眞了，竟忘記了自己是個猴子。當他做皇帝的時候，看見人羣中有一個美麗的女孩子，他就奔上去，正要擁抱她，而喊出「我的皇后……」的時候，玩猴人把牠頭頸裹的繩子一牽，將牠拉回到塲子中央，繼續做戲，於是牠只得服服貼貼地跟着繩子走。</p>
<p>當牠做將軍的時候，看見人羣中一個骯髒的男孩子，扮着鬼臉嘲笑牠，牠就奔上去，正要舉起了指揮刀，想劈他，玩猴人把牠頭頸要的繩子一牽，將牠拉到塲子中央，繼續做戲，於是牠只得服服貼貼地跟着繩子走。</p>
<p>「劈…拍…劈…拍…」孩子們紛紛把銅板丟到玩猴人的脚邊，他們拍手歡呼道：「這猴子戲做得好！」</p>
<p>玩猴人把錢收拾起來，放在自己的袋裏。帶着猴子到小飯館裹，他自己吃得又醉又飽，却把一點殘湯給猴子充饑。</p>
<p>天下爆竹一般響</p>
<p>一個爆竹對許多孩子說：「你們不要害怕我。你們應該把我弄上天去。有些爆竹一上了天，便把肚腸壞了，身子破了，砰砰拍拍的響起來，把你們的膽兒都嚇碎了，耳朶都震聾了。他們眞是害人！我决不和他們一樣。我一上了天，一定不改變我的肚腸，不炸裂我的身體，不發出嚇人的響聲，不放出討厭的火藥氣。我耍給你們和平！寗靜。你們趕快把我弄上天罷！」</p>
<p>孩子們相信了她的話，把牠的火藥綫點着了。爆竹得了火，瞧哪：這麼一竄，就竄入高高的天空。嚇！他是多末得意哪！</p>
<p>可是，你聽：「砰…砰…拍…拍…！」那末饗。空中瀰漫了火藥氣，地上充滿了不安，孩子們都嚇得面如土色，躱的躲，逃的逃……</p>
<p>原來，這爆竹只要孩子們弄牠上天，牠起先答應他們的話，不過是騙騙他們的啊。</p>

<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>許多動物都有尾巴的。人類的尾巴雖然已經看不見了，但是據說在人類的原始時代也曾有過尾巴的，這一說是根據我們脊骨末端的構造而來，而且現在還有些人仍然長着短短的尾巴，不過為數已經極少極少罷了。</p>
<p>除了人之外，一切有脊惟的動物幾乎都有尾巴。如果我們去觀察它們的骨骼，我們就可以看見在它們的脊骨的末端都有一串或長或短的骨節，很便於屈曲的，越近末端，骨節便越小，這便是它們的尾巴。</p>
<p>尾巴的大小不，這就要看那一種動物將它的尾巴來作何用而定。熊的尾巴多數是短小的，河馬的尾巴也不能與它的龐大的身體相稱。但是有些動物的尾巴竟會比身體長到兩三倍的。</p>
<p>在夏天，如果我們留心觀察一條牛而看見蒼蠅來叮擾它的時候，我們便可以領略到尾巴的一個作用了。在它的尾巴的末端，另有細長的毛一簇這是使它驅趕蒼蠅時更有效力的工具。</p>
<p>有些猴子會使用它們的尾巴來攀樹，或者簡直自己的尾巴來吊住自己的身體而倒懸在樹枝下。它們的尾巴漸漸變成特殊的適合這種用處：我們呌它作「捲尾」就是這個意思。</p>
<p>有些動物因為在水裏生活的時候多，它們的尾巴便發生了像船舵的作用。那其實不是魚類的偉大的鯨魚却用它的厲害非常的尾巴作為在水中推進之用。又如袋鼠的尾巴也是發達得非常的，它用來支持身體的重量，當它人立着時，它的尾巴和兩條後腿便成為一個很穩固的三脚架，就是精於拳鬥的人也不容易把一隻人立着的袋鼠擊倒。</p>
<p>以上所舉的，不過幾種動物的尾巴的作用，其餘的許多動物的尾巴，都各有各的作用，你想知得更詳細，最好是自己隨時留心作實地的觀察。</p>

<p>煤，煤球，炭這類東西的主要成分是炭棄，炭素這樣東西一經燃燒，便成為一種氣體，名為二養化炭，如果空巾的養氣發生不足的時候，就不能成為二養化炭，而成為一養化炭。這二個名詞，雖然寫起來只有二與一之別，可是二養化炭是亳無危險的，一養化炭却能致人死命。因為二養化炭吸到肺裏絕無關係發生，一養化炭吸進去後，立刻同血球化合，會使全身馬上感覺血球的不足而不能生活。試想閉室烘煤爐，等到室內有限的養氣全帮助爐中的煤球燃燒凈盡室內豈能不發生一養化炭？好危險啊！願大家多多注意才是呢。</p>

<p>附註——這種游戲簡單易行，我在小學當童子軍的時候，會試騐過幾决。其結果，最優者能默寫至二十餘種之多，因各物錯雜臚列，叉在光綫炫耀之小室內，預會者之神經，最易給它擾亂啊。（懷淸）</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>那邊就是古代偉大的聖殿，很隱蔽的和現代忙亂熱鬧的世界互相隔絕，整日的有白雲在上面浮動着，有無數的烏在那邊繞圈兒飛翔着，風聲在那裏呼呼地作響，而在它們的脚下，就躺着一座羅木城。</p>
<p>在這些偉大的石塊中間，小南洛常常要跑進去的，一霎時間，他已在那幽暗的穹門的後面不見了。柏德希厮守在外面的街道上，總得苦苦地想，，裏面到底有什麼魔力，會把它那從不分離的好友吸引進去呢。</p>
<p>它曾有一二次要想親自跑進去瞧個明白，拖着那送牛乳的小車，跑上階石去，但是總被一個穿着銀邊黑衣的大漢，叱退出來；它生怕小主人要遭受甚麼災禍，便耐心兒的守候在外面，直等到那孩子走了出來，方始安心。</p>
<p>柏德希之所以覺得不安，並不是為了小南洛入到這所在去的緣故：它原也知道人們都要上禮拜堂去；全村的人都到那紅風輪對面的那所破舊的小禮拜堂裏去的。它所覺得不安的，是為了小南洛每决出來時，往往而色有異，有時滿面通紅，有時變成慘白；他回到了家裏，就靜靜地坐着，連玩要都不高與了。他兀自在那裏夢想甚麼，兩眼直望到運河水平線外的暮空，分外的靜默，簡實是含着憂鬱。</p>
<p>柏德希很詫異的想，究竟為的甚麼呢？它以為一個小小的孩子，忽地變得道樣的嚴肅，是不自然，幷且也不應當的。因此它就盡力的設法使小南洛同它在陽光照耀的田野裏玩着，或在忙亂的市塲上閒逛。</p>
<p>但是小南洛並不上小禮拜堂去：他往往是到那最大的禮拜寺裏去的；柏德希守候在鐵門外面的石階上，直滑身體躺在地上，一面呵欠，一面嘆氣，又時時的叫着，然而都沒有用，直等到那孩子從鐵門中出來，將兩臂挽住了它的頭頸，將他的嘴親着它那黃色的闊額，老是喃喃地說着這兩句同樣的話：——「我只要能够瞧見它們，柏德希！——我只要能够瞧見它們！」</p>

<p>— 楨</p>
<p>交通部主辦之電信事業，關於工程上之建設，業務上之改進，人事上之整理，無論在電報或電話方面，均有顯著之成績，本刋根據事實，以簡括文字與數字，迭經發表，為社會人士所悉知。惟電信建設，需欵甚殷，如桿綫之購置，機件之購運，工程之設施，非巨萬之建設費不可。而全國報話局臺材料之消耗，員工之薪資，公費之開支，又非巨萬之維持費不可。在此電政經濟困苦之時，每年又無國庫補助之支給，維持現狀，頗感不易，欲言發展，實覺為難！交通當局已遇到此種難關，而思所以克服之道。</p>
<p>大凡言理財者：不外開源與節流而已。二者國營事業與私人企業不同，而電信事業與其他國營事業又不同也。電政開源之道有二：一方面應使電信工程上之設備，力臻完善，俾通信效率，得以增加；一方面應使電信業務上之處理，極端簡便，俾社會人士咸感滿意，樂為之用，則業務發達，收入自然增加，斯二者為交通部現今所持之政策，而經證明有相當之成功。至節流之道亦有二：　建設費之减少，　維持費之節省是也。查我國電信事業與歐美各國相較，已形落後，若不積極建設，何能搆成現代國家之條件。故建設費一項，須年有增加，實無减少之可能。至維持費之節省，若在不妨害工程建設與業務發展之原則下，自可儘量施行。故交通部之節流方法，着重於維持費之節省，深合產業合理化之原理也。</p>
<p>近日報載：「交通部因電欽支絀，應力求緊縮，自二十五年二月份起，所有各報局各電臺機房報房錢路維持材料費，及綫路維持工運雜費，統按概算數目减一成。各電話機房綫路維持材料費，减二成動支，共計節省的百餘萬元」云云。查此百餘萬元，在經濟充裕之時，為正常開支，自無可疵議。若於經濟困難之時，能緊縮一分，則收一分之實效，而在國難期間，尤應力行緊縮，埋頭苦幹。吾人於此，深服交通當局用心之苦矣。</p>
<p>「緊縮」與「發展」，似相反而實相成之名辭也。「緊縮」應以不妨害「發展」事業為範圍，於「發展」之中求「緊縮」，則事業始能推進。「發展」應以「緊縮」辦法為手段，於「緊縮」之中求「發展」，則事業乃可維持。交通部最近實行之「緊縮」政策，卽寓「發展」政策之用，將來施行之「發展」政策，卽收「緊縮」政策之果。卽「緊縮」，卽「發展」，亦「發展」，亦「緊縮。」明乎此中原理，始可語於現代國家所行之經濟政策。</p>
<h3 id="c236">為報綫搭掛軍話再請軍事當局設法制止 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>各地駐軍為維持地方治安及肅淸殘匪起見，往往於電報綫路搭掛軍用電話，以通消息。記者以報錢搭掛軍話，不僅妨碍通報，且軍事通話，亦必感受困難，用特於本刋第四十六期為文詳述其利害，並致希望於軍事當局之諒解。顧近數月來，電報綫路被掛軍話之事，時有所聞，雖經交通當局文電交涉，尙鮮成效，記者深知搭掛軍話之舉，影響於電政及一般公衆者恭重，亟願本國民之天職，披瀝所見，再向吾軍事當局呼籲焉。</p>
<p>按近年以來，交部為推廣電話交通起見，特將各區電報支綫，儘量開放長途電話，以利通訊。故各該電路，以報話並用，平時負荷，已甚繁重，如再被軍隊佔用，不特負荷增加，通信阻滯，且以各該支綫，均係單綫連絡，勢必漏電過甚，亦將無法通話。故非不得已時，佔錢通話，實屬有害無益之舉，卽欲通話，亦必與當地電局洽商接錢開放之妥善辦法，庶能避免一切困難，此應請軍事當局注意者一也。</p>
<p>內地長途電話，除開放公用外，大抵尙須供公路行車通訊之用，故電話之通暢與吾，與行車之安全，有莫大關係，最近西蘭（陝西長安至甘肅蘭州）公路沿綫長途電話，卽因被軍隊佔用，發生嚴重之危險。在軍事當局維持治安之苦心，固為吾人所共諒，但須兼顧當前之事實，與有關各方作縝密之接洽，則雙方稱便矣！此應請軍事當局注意者二也。</p>
<p>雖然，就吾人所知，軍事當局對於取締報綫搭掛軍話，固亦嘗三令五申。無如各地駐軍為圖省事起見，往往便宜行事，希望軍事當局對於有關部隊，剴切曉諭，或頒布行軍臨時電話辦法，切實執行，務使在不妨碍公衆通信原則下，謀軍訊之靈活。此又願請軍事當局注意者三也。</p>
<p>總而言之，吾人籲請軍事當局合作者，有下列數端：　非不得巳時，請勿搭掛軍話。　苟欲搭掛軍話，並統制通訊部隊，切實執行。倘能實行上述三點，吾信於電信交通與軍事交通，均有裨益也。</p>
<h3 id="c237">電報在商業上的主要用途 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 陶公</p>
<p>近世商業進步，競爭的方術，也隨着進步，商業競爭同軍事競爭一樣，同樣的需要武器，所以呌做「商戰」，不過方式與性質相差而巳。在商戰中也有各　不同的武器，電報就是其中之一。「軍事責乎迅速」的倌條，同樣的適合淤商戰，因此電報以其獨有的迅速的條件在商業上佔着重要地位。到現在，凡是聰敏而有眼光的商人，對於商業上往來的一切事項，大都利用電報來靈活處理，因為這樣才能收「迅赴事機」的效果，雖則須要用去電報費若干，但所獲的利益，直要超過幾十百千倍呢！話雖如此，但商塲中不知利用這種的利器與人競爭，尙不知有多少呢？這般人大都是因為不明瞭電報在商業上的重要性及其用途之故，因此不能與善用電報的人獲利得多，眞是可惜！在電信界服務的吾們，對於商界人士，向來一視同仁，無分厚薄，希望人人都能享受電報的利益，並不願給一部份人或某一階級所專享。因此我們特地將電報在商業上的主要用途，公開寫出。使人：「機會均等」呢！</p>
<p>定貨　如果一家商行，知道當地需要某種貨物，而這種貨物在市塲上又極缺乏須向外埠採購時，最妥速的方法，是用電報。這個方法，可避免貨價的高漲，又不致失去推銷的時機。我可舉出一個淺近的例子來證明電報定貨的效用：記得前年夏季，南京天氣大熱，津浦鐵路營業所運到一批德州西瓜，大而且甜，市面立時銷售一空。當地某水菓商看了這德州瓜受人歡迎，認為有利可圖，便一面發了一個電報，給德州瓜商定了一大批，一面開始預售，不待貨到，已經支配完盡，於是利市三倍。同時另有幾家水菓商，也紛紛向德州定貨，無奈是用郵寄去，等到信函來往，接洽妥貼，貨到京時，則酷暑已减，賣價大跌，這批生意險耍賠本。不知利用電報定貨的商店只好嘆自己運氣不好了！</p>
<h3 id="c238">緊縮政策 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>催欵　用電報催收帳欵，在我國尙未踴躍，但在歐美諸國，早已行之有年，十分普遍。現在催欵電報，在歐美諸國的電報營業上已佔重要地位，足見成效一般。原來用電報催收帳欵，的確有他的優點。第一是迅速，可免書信往返稽延時日之弊，而得提早收回帳欵本息之利。第二是可靠，在我國一般人都存着「電報事急」的心理，若用電報催收帳欵，當然易於引起付欵人的注意，而把這筆帳目，儘先付還。若遇到客戶有不穩的消息，利用電報催索帳欵，允為迅速而有效。</p>
<p>報帳　電報報帳，我國已有利用之者，但不甚多。在歐美各國，已風行一時，凡設有許多分行的大商行，大都利用這個制度，用以控制各地分行的財政。所以總行對於各地分行當日的帳目，調查甚為便利。這樣，分行朦蔽帳目的毛病，自然無從發生。年來我國各地頗多新興的大商行大工廠，為謀事業安蚤計，實有利用電報報帳之必要。</p>
<p>報吿市價　市價漲落，動關營業得失，若用書信報吿，稽延時日，損失堪虞。若用電報報吿，那末一漲一落，瞬息就知道了！那樣貨物宜進宜拋，那樣貨物採購應多應少，可依市價電報做個南針。營業獲利，可操左券。</p>
<p>此外如周轉不　，向人乞援；所　匯栗，因故停兌；成貨缺乏，關照趕製；以及市面突變，報吿消息等等，均可利用電報，傳獲得圓滿的結果。總之，電報在商業上的用途，至廣至博，為本刋篇幅所限，未能一一舉述，要在商人之善於利用而已。</p>
<h3 id="c239">新聞電報與新聞電話 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 麟</p>
<p>按照國際電信公的電報規則第六十八條之規定，凡電報之電文專載關於政治商務等消息及新聞，以備刋登新聞紙及共他定期刊物者，准作為新聞電報减價收費。交通部依據此項原則，特將新聞電報價目照尋常電價目收四分之一，並訂新聞電報規則一種，對於寄發新聞電報辦法規定甚詳。</p>
<p>新聞電報所以特予優待之故，以新聞報紙除為營業外，尙含有一種社會敎育意味，其作用不僅專為消息之傳遞與政情之露佈而已。如民族文化之推展，人民智識之灌輸，其有賴新聞報紙為之促進者甚鉅，一國文化水準之高低，及社會敎育之是吾普及，可從新聞報紙及其他定期刊物之多寡中，得到相當估量惟是新聞報紙之各版，除關於本埠新聞外；共大部份均係由國內外各地供給之新聞材料，此項材料，旣稱新聞，自必係最新之消息，倘以失去時間性之材料披露，是不免有「明日黃花」之誚。欲求消息量新，則其傳達，務必以迅捷為主，故各地消息，大都賴電報傳遞，卽所謂新聞電報。如果新聞電報，亦必照尋常電一例收費，則此項電費，勢必為數甚鉅，一般新聞報社資本有限，自屬難以負担，直接影響新聞報紙之營業，間接有礙文化事業之發展，故各國一致承認，新聞電報應照尋常電减價收費。</p>
<p>說者謂：「電報電話同為通信之利器，新聞電報旣可優待特予减價，則又何嘗不可倣此，成例規定新聞電話减價辦法？且國際電信公的何以僅有新聞電報之規定而不及於新聞電話？其故安在？」此說就一方面觀察，亦未始不近情理，但在另一方面，試一分析電報電話之根本異點，則不難了然於新聞電話所以獨付缺如之故。按電報與電話間有一顯著之區別，卽電報所傳達之內容，有文字為之表現，而電話則單憑對話，雙方所談者內容如何？第三者無從探悉。且新聞電報旣僅照尋常電價收四分之一，則共傳達之內容，自應絕對以新聞為限，故新聞電報規則第十六條規定：「新聞電報之電文，以關於政治商業等之消息，欲刋登於新聞紙或期刋者為限，不得含有私事性質或類似廣吿之文字」。國際電報規則第六十九條亦規定：「新聞電報內不得含有私事性質之語句」。誠以新聞電報收費特廉，倘不加以規定，難免無人假新聞電報之名，而傳達不合於新聞性質之電報，以圖取巧。電報以有文字表現，共內容是吾合乎新聞電報，甚為明顯，至電話則彼此問答，是吾合乎新聞電話？殊難稽攷，以此之故，各國均無特為新聞電話减價之例，無論新聞記者，報館，或雜誌社所裝市內電話及所發長途電話一槪照章收費，惟在長途電話方面，英美等國有夜間通話减價辦法以資疏勻話務。此項辦法，雖適用於公衆全體，但以新聞電話通話多在夜間，故對於新聞事業特為有利。</p>
<p>我國交通部亦於去年訂定長途電話夜間通話减價辦法，規定所有普通及加緊通話夜間價目，一律按照日間價目七折計算，自去年十二月一日起，先就南京，上海，杭州，鎭江，武進，無錫，吳縣等七處，試辦三個月。實行以後，新聞界方面無不深戚便利。現因試辦期間至二月底屆滿，聞交部以過去三月試辦成績甚佳，擬再繼續舉辦，是亦不營新聞電話之一種優待也。</p>
<h3 id="c240">納費公電收費辦法的補充 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>新訂劃一納費公電收費辦法的內容及其優點，曾經本刋登載，一般收發報人當已明瞭其利用方法，母庸贅述。該項收費辦法內各項規定，對於各種華洋文電報，均可一律適用，故第三條規定：「發報人補充或更正原電之任何部份者，所有補充或更正之字，應按字計算」。惟上項規定，對於發報人補充或更正華文電報之收報人姓名住址，尙覺稍欠便利。例如發報人將下列一電：「上海江海關黃子安「欵已匯」發出後，用接電局通知收報人已不在江海關，電報無法投遞，擬用納費公電通知收報局更正原電之收報人姓名住址為「法租界霞飛路敦厚里二八三號黃子良」，「共計十四字，按照前項收費辦法之規定，應繳納十四字之報費一元四角。但發報人如不用納費公電，而另發一電如下：「上海法租界霞飛路敦厚里二八三號黃子良—欵已匯」，按照現行國內電報營業通則之規定，（收報地名作二字，收報人姓名住址作三字電文三字），全電祗需報費八角，反較拍發納費公電可省報費六角。是以該納費公電收費辦法第三條之規定，對於電文較短之華文電報，頗戚不便。茲經交通部飭將現行釗一納費公電收費辦法第三條條文補充修改如下：</p>
<p>「發報人補充或更正原電之任何部份者，所有補充或更正之字，按字計費（例如補充住址二字，應收二字之報費，更正電文一字，應收一字之報費）。惟發報人補充或更正華文私務電報之收報人住址名稱者，所有補充或更正各字，應照國內電報營業通則第八十三條之規定核收報費。（例如補充或更正華文明語尋常電之住址不逾十三字者，槪照三字收費。）」</p>
<p>上項補充辦法施行以後，一般發報人如用納費公電補充或更正華文電報之收報人姓名住址，所有補充或更正各字，均可按照國內電報營業通則第八十三條之規定核收報費，卽收報人姓名住址，共計明語不逾十三字或密語不逾十四字者，得分別作為三字或四字計費，逾此接字加費、則上述補充收報入姓名住址之納費公電一電，雖共有十四字之多，但祗須繳納報費四角，仍較另發一電為便宜。一般發報人自必樂於採用，以資節省。由此可見納費公電收費辦注的補充修改，雖是一種小小改革，對於發報人頗為有利也。</p>

<p>該項長途電話以範圍過廣，綫路較長，故先將擬設之綫路名稱决定，並規劃每一綫分若干段，然後再分段建築。故自興工以來，架桿設錢之工程進展，頗為迅速。現已完成者，有如下列之八路：</p>
<p>濟南至靑島錢。按濟靑間本已設有長途話綫二對開放通話，現經加掛改建，共有話錢三對，幻象錢一對。綫條旣已增加，通話自感便利。</p>
<p>蘇州至嘉興間設綫工程，業於二月十五日竣工。</p>
<p>南京至天津間長途話綫已完成者，計有南京至徐州一段，及濟南至天津一段。</p>
<p>南京至漢口間長途話綫計分五段，其中業已完工者，計有南京至順安，湖口至陽新，及陽新至漢口等三段，尙在進行中者有順安至股家匯安慶，及殷家匯至湖口兩段。</p>
<p>南京至杭州間長途話綫分為二段，現宜興至吳興一段設錢工程，業已竣工，吳與至杭州一段，不日卽行興工建築，綫路較短，完成之期，當不在遠。</p>
<p>漢口至長沙間長途話綫亦分為二段，已完成者為漢口至岳陽一段，其餘岳陽至長沙一段，正在建築中，日內卽可竣工。</p>
<p>銅山至鄭縣間本已設有直達電報錢路，現已决定就原有之電桿加掛長途話綫，以收事半功倍之效。上項加掛話綫工程，日內卽可開始動工。</p>
<p>鄭縣至漢口間長途設綫工程現分五段進行，不日亦將興工建築。</p>
<p>至其他各路話綫，或正在規劃進行，或不日卽將開始興工建築，全部工程之完成，為期當不在遠。社會人士不乏關心該項長途電話工程者，愛將其實際進展狀况，作一簡要報吿。</p>

<p>— 馭周</p>
<p>整頓廣播事業，最重要而又最難解抉者，蓋莫若廣播節目。今夫廣播電台之工程設計，關係不為不大，惟僅需一决整頓，卽有欠缺，亦不過週波不穩，發生干擾，致使廣播聲浪不十分淸晰而已，若廣播節目，則需有不斷的注意，而辦理不善，則效果未收，遺害將無窮矣。</p>
<p>廣播節目如何方得謂為妥善，是當先考慮舉辦廣播事業之目的，舉辦廣播事業之目的，吾人可作極簡單之語，曰「提倡正當娛樂推行社會敎育」。若此言而不謬，則廣播節目應包含兩要素，卽「興趣」與「敎育意昧」是也。顧此兩要素，各有其限度，各廣播電台若苟僅顧及「興趣」要素，遂每有迎合大衆心理，不惜降低標凖，而以極粗俗鄙俚之節目，大肆廣播，傷風敗俗，莫此為茶。若僅顧及「敎育要素」，藉廣播之機能，閘揚學術，宣佈政令，傳達消息，此固無可　議，但以我國敎育之未能普及，民衆求知慾之低弱，在十數萬收音機裝戶中，能有幾何於工作疲倦之後，而猶正襟危坐，恭聆此種缺乏「興趣」之節目，是其實際收效固亦甚微也。以一般言之，裝設收音機者，大都為消遣娛樂之用，　側重於「興趣」要素，而負監督責任者，立於政府地位，則每側重於「敎育」要素。甚人歷觀交通部年來對於廣播節目之整飭，如禁播淫詞邪曲也，添播關於黨義公民常識民族英雄小史之節目也，其用意蓋亦深遠。</p>
<p>惟是播音節目，雖迭經交通部積極整頓，而各廣播電台仍多陽奉陰違，木能切實遵辦，以致外間時有責言。考其原因，一般裝戶，率以「興趣」為前提，各廣播電台為吸收多數聽衆，以謀發展營業，遂不得不多所遷就，是以欲切實整頓廣播節目，實有採用更一進步之方法，其法為何，卽設法提高聽衆程度是矣。交通部有鍳於此，為考查聽衆心理，以資因勢利導，爰製定下列廣播聽戶意見調查表</p>

<p>本刊特為闢問答一欄，社會人士，對於電報電話收發手續及對於電信章程不明瞭之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刊表示歡迎具情奉答。</p>
<p>一，江都劉世奇君問竊查國內電報營業通則第一百十二條，關於分送電報應收抄費之份數，與各收報人住址姓名之數目相等。「例如全電共有收報人住址姓名二個，卽應書明「分送二份，」其抄費亦照二份收取。」鄙意以為抄費，應除本位計算。譬如全電共有收報人住址姓名二個，只能納抄費一份，蓋電局對於本電第一收報人，當然譯送，無所謂抄，似不能收取抄費也。」</p>
<p>（答）查分送電報抄送時，除官軍通電內所列各收報人住址及名稱完全照錄外每份祇載該份應列之收報人住址及名稱一個其餘收報人名稱住址及納費業務標識「分送之份」或（mT）照章均不列入。各收報局對於分送電報，應旣按照來電所註分送份數，另行抄送，其原底祇能作為來報底留局借查，抄電手續，並未减省。故分送電報之抄費份數，應照原電所含收報人姓名住址之數目計算。</p>
<p>二，貴陽王子成君問　發寄本城電報，用電韶機傳發或抄送者，應如何收費，又剿匪軍電發寄本城者，應如何收費？請示知為感。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Military Authorities Adopt a Policy of Both Lenience and Severity. All Mutinying Soldiers Are Disarmed. Ring Leading Officers Are Dismissed; Rumors of Some Committing Suicide. Okada Was Not Harmed and Has Now Resumed the Position of Prime Minister. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese coup has now ended. The Prime Minister Okada, who was rumored to have been killed for several days, is now safe and sound. The entire population was deeply relieved to receive the report that the mutinying soldiers had surrendered this afternoon. Before they could recover from this news, they heard the joyful news that Prime Minister Okada had not been harmed, which was even more surprising. According to an official announcement by the Cabinet, Okada was not harmed and remains the Prime Minister. His brother-in-law, Colonel Matsuo, a retired military officer who resembled Okada, was mistaken for Okada by the mutinying soldiers when they stormed the Prime Minister's residence on Wednesday morning and was killed. Although the Prime Minister's residence was occupied by the rioting troops, Okada managed to hide inside and only escaped at dawn. Yesterday afternoon, Okada entrusted the acting Prime Minister Goto to submit his resignation, but the Emperor did not approve it. Tonight, Okada entered the palace to meet with the Emperor. The Cabinet has now announced that Goto has been dismissed from his position as acting Prime Minister. It is expected that the Cabinet will undergo a reorganization under Okada's leadership. The government has known that Okada was not dead since Friday, but kept it a secret because the mutinying soldiers had not retreated, fearing that they would harden their stance if their goal was not achieved.

<p>Tokyo: The Martial Law Headquarters launched balloons this morning in the areas occupied by the action troops, dropping leaflets from the air, expressing the authorities' determination and urging them to surrender. As a result, this action by the authorities was effective, and most of the soldiers surrendered without resistance. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After the Martial Law Headquarters issued a suppression order, expressing a resolute attitude, 120 members of the riot troops expressed their obedience. Except for a small number of troops occupying the Prime Minister's official residence and the Sanno Hotel, all the remaining action troops surrendered to the authorities and returned to their original garrisons. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Martial Law Commander issued an order to suppress the mutinying soldiers at 5:30 a.m. on the 29th, according to the Emperor's command. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: By 1:00 p.m. today, all the mutinying troops had been disarmed and order was restored. A dozen or so of their officers were summoned to the Minister of War's official residence. The security situation in the capital was completely restored to calm. The Martial Law Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. that all the mutinying troops had surrendered by 2:00 p.m. and the incident had been quelled. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The officers involved in this mutiny have been decided to be dismissed. The Cabinet announced the following at noon today: Infantry Captains Kiyosada Koda, Teruzo Ando, Shiro Nonaka; Infantry Lieutenants Motoaki Nakahashi, Yasuhide Kurihara, Seichu Nibu, Nao Sakai, Kohei Kiyohara, Kinetsuro Suzuki; Artillery Lieutenant Masaru Tanaka; Infantry Second Lieutenants Hachiro Hayashi, Toshihiko Ikeda, Taro Takahashi, Kiyosumi Mugino, Minoru Tokiwa (all transliterated). The above are all dismissed from their positions. (Den-tsu dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The mastermind of the mutiny gathered several comrades this afternoon, lined them up outside the gate of an occupied government office, and sang war songs to bid farewell. Then he asked his comrades to join in the chorus, and immediately shot himself in the head with a pistol at that moment. It is said that several people also committed suicide one after another, but this has not been confirmed. Many Japanese believe that only suicide can atone for the crime of disobeying the Emperor's edict. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Minister of War Kawashima Issues a Statement of Atonement; The Mutiny Incident Has Disgraced the Nation; A Stain on the History of the Showa Era, Truly Regrettable; Avoidance of Bloody Tragedy Near the Imperial Palace <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: With the incident coming to an end, Minister of War Kawashima issued a statement at 7:00 p.m. on the 29th as follows: "It is truly fearful and regrettable that an unprecedented mutiny incident has occurred within the Army, disrupting military regulations and tranquility, leading to the issuance of a martial law bulletin, and tarnishing the honor of the nation and the national army both at home and abroad, leaving an indelible stain on the history of the Showa era. This is all due to my incompetence, and I feel a great responsibility for it. I have been working hard to handle the incident as soon as possible, restore public order, and establish military discipline, in order to ensure that nothing is left undone. However, as the area is close to the Imperial Palace, and the residences of various members of the Imperial Family, government agencies, foreign embassies, and the homes of numerous residents are all concentrated here, in anticipation of the harm that could be caused to them, I have tried every possible measure to avoid a bloody tragedy, which inevitably led to a delay of several days. It was not until the 28th that the Martial Law Commander received a great command, conveyed it to the leaders of the mutinying troops, and urged them to reflect on their actions, but to no avail. Therefore, I decided to use force to eliminate these people and establish public order. Since the morning of the 29th, I have ordered the residents of the nearby areas to evacuate to other places, and at the same time, I have quickly started a sweep operation, so that the officers and soldiers of the mutinying troops have surrendered one after another. By 1:00 p.m., without bloodshed, the entire area was completely cleared and order was restored. The military will take this incident as an opportunity to reform and enhance the true value of the national army, in order to repay the Emperor's concern and live up to the trust of the people. I hereby declare." (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Two Armies Almost Opened Fire <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Martial Law Headquarters announced at 6:00 a.m. on the 29th that the troops who started the uprising on the 26th were strongly advised by their superiors to return to their original units, but they did not agree. If the authorities were to take strong measures against these troops, a bloody tragedy would be inevitable. Moreover, because the area is close to the Imperial Palace and the residences of various members of the Imperial Family, and there are foreign embassies in the area, there was a fear of causing unfortunate incidents. Furthermore, the spirit of the Imperial Army requires that fighting between the Imperial Army be avoided as much as possible. For these reasons, the situation was delayed, and public order could not be ensured. This Headquarters was terrified, and then received a great command, conveyed to these troops to return to their original units, but they refused to obey and resisted the great command. Since the matter has come to this point, the authorities have decided to use force to quickly resolve the situation. The scope of the firefight will be limited to the vicinity of Kojimachi and Nagatacho. It is hoped that the general public will not be misled by rumors and will stay safely at home. This is hereby announced in advance. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Martial Law Headquarters issued the following statement today: "The young officers who suddenly occupied part of the Nagatacho area, leading troops since the 26th, have not obeyed the Imperial command and have become rebels. These young officers have been earnestly advised to return to their original units by the Minister of War, the Martial Law Commander, the Divisional Commander, the Regimental Commander, and other military leaders and colleagues day and night for three days. Although there were several occasions when they seemed to listen, they suddenly went back on their word and raised the banner of rebellion against the Imperial command, which is extremely regrettable. However, many of the soldiers led by these officers are naturally unaware of the situation, and were led there simply by following the orders of their officers. Therefore, we are unwilling to regard them as rebels. Until now, these soldiers have been persuaded by their superiors, such as the Divisional Commander and the Regimental Commander, to explain the principles of obedience and disobedience. Sometimes they even dismounted and earnestly persuaded the soldiers. Moreover, they were scattered in various places, so since last night, leaflets explaining the principles of obedience and disobedience have been distributed. This morning, they were also distributed by airplanes, and various other means such as advertising balloons and telephones were used to devise various means. As a result, since last night until this morning, more than one hundred non-commissioned officers and below have surrendered. Furthermore, around 9:00 a.m., about 150 people near the Akasaka Sanno Hotel, 200 people near Akasaka Mitsuke, and 120 people in the Akasaka Tameike area surrendered around 9:20 a.m. Fortunately, there has been no exchange of fire so far."

<h3 id="e9">Attention of the House of Peers <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The House of Peers is paying close attention to the political situation after the resignation of the Cabinet. The Research Association and other factions are considering countermeasures by their respective leaders, but there has been no opportunity to exchange opinions, so the attitudes of each faction have not yet been determined. According to the opinions of the leaders of the Research Association, the current situation is very serious, and a cabinet of national unity should naturally emerge. The House of Peers should assist and cooperate in overcoming difficulties, regardless of who leads the cabinet. According to the opinion of the Koseikai, due to the occurrence of this incident, the next cabinet must have a strong force. If it can pass through a special session of parliament, the future of the political situation can be expected to be stable for the time being. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Detailed Account of the Aftermath; The Whole Country Awaits the Next Cabinet <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The mutinying soldiers who occupied several government offices on Wednesday had originally planned to withdraw yesterday morning, but suddenly changed their plans. Therefore, the authorities limited these people to withdraw before noon on Friday, otherwise we would attack them immediately. However, this threat was ineffective. Naval, army, and civilian officials then hurriedly held a meeting, and the Emperor also participated. This morning, the Emperor instructed the loyal troops that if the rebels did not submit and surrender, they should be driven away by force. General Kashii, the garrison commander, instructed the mutinying soldiers, saying, "Soldiers, consider this: The Emperor has ordered you to return to your camps. We admire your bravery and loyalty to your superiors. Now that your superiors have admitted their mistakes, you can surrender without shame. Return to your camps and your crimes will be forgiven. If you continue to resist, you will be shot." This instruction clearly had an effect. At 10:50 this morning, Kashii issued a public announcement, stating, "Most of the junior officers and soldiers of the rioting troops have surrendered without much resistance. The small teams of soldiers occupying the Prime Minister's official residence and the Sanno Hotel will soon be punished." General Kashii then broadcast the good news again at 12:50, saying that the rioting troops had been completely suppressed and had all returned to their camps to surrender their weapons. At 11:40, Kashii had issued a bulletin, saying that public order could be restored soon and that the ban on newspapers and transportation would also be lifted. Kashii kept Japan and the rest of the world informed of the overall situation at all times. This morning, he announced that hundreds of soldiers and non-commissioned officers had surrendered during the night.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m., more than 160 mutinying soldiers passed by the residence of a Reuters correspondent. These men had all surrendered their weapons before entering the Aoyama barracks. At 9:20, another 120 people surrendered. The remaining members of the mutinying troops occupying the Prime Minister's official residence and the Sanno Hotel also surrendered soon after, without firing a shot.</p>
<p>This morning, General Kashii issued a statement saying, "If the handling of this incident is not handled carefully, there is a fear that it will have shocking consequences. The army leaders have shown benevolence, patience, and noble courage, and the behavior of the mutinying soldiers has also been very orderly, not leaving their jurisdiction. Their commanders have been repeatedly advised from all sides to return to their original garrisons, but they have ignored them. The authorities have hesitated and delayed in handling this incident because they feared that imposing coercion would lead to a bloody tragedy, and that the use of firearms would endanger the Imperial Palace, the residences of nobles, and the consulates of several foreign ambassadors and ministers. Furthermore, the spirit of the nation does not allow the Imperial Army to fight each other. However, the rebels' delay in surrendering cannot be tolerated, so the Emperor's edict was followed, ordering the teams involved in the riot to return to their camps on Friday. However, they stubbornly resisted the Imperial command, so it was decided to seek a solution by force. If war breaks out, its scope should be limited to a small area near the Kojimachi district and the Nagata-cho district. The general public should stay safely at home and not be misled by rumors." Today, Tokyo is strictly inspecting the telegrams sent out, so communication with the rest of the world is cut off. This morning, Mrs. and Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several other officials also made plans to avoid danger. Residents near Nagata-cho were ordered by the authorities to move to various schools as a precaution. This morning, the number of trains was reduced. There were no pedestrians on the streets near the "war zone". At night, Kashii's troops surrounded Nagata-cho. Just after 8:00 this morning, many tanks scattered leaflets to the mutinying soldiers. After 9:00, airplanes dropped leaflets from the sky, urging the mutinying officers and soldiers to surrender.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. today, everything in Tokyo returned to normal, but the martial law order has not yet been lifted and will have to be implemented for at least several more days. Hundreds of obstacles have been removed, and crowds of pedestrians and vehicles fill the streets. Train service and domestic telegraphic communications in Japanese are expected to be restored tonight.</p>
<p>Thousands of loyal soldiers, dressed for battle and wearing white armbands, rushed to the barracks of the 1st and 3rd Regiments in Aoyama. Although they looked tired, they were very strong. Most of them then left there to be stationed in other places.</p>
<p>Prince Kan'in, the Chief of the Army General Staff, who has been recuperating in Odawara since last December, returned to Tokyo at 11:15 last night. The meeting of the princes, which began yesterday, only ended this morning.</p>
<p>The whole of Japan now wants to know whether the "resurrected" Prime Minister Okada is the one who will replace him with someone else. If so, who will be his successor? Only then will the whole country be able to judge the outcome of this mutiny. The whole country naturally demands a "strong" prime minister, assisted by "strong" colleagues, the so-called "strong" is national unity. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Moscow: The Pravda, in an article on the Tokyo incident, said, "Judging from various reports, the actions of the young officers were well prepared. It is known that Captain Nonaka, who led this mutiny, is a loyal follower of Araki and Mazaki, so this action was clearly not only with their consent, but also under their direct command. As far as the government is concerned, the results of this election indicate the position Japan is currently in. At home, it is a warning that the foreign policy line must be more cautious. On the military fascist side, the failure of the Seiyukai and the great success of the nationwide anti-fascist slogan should be like thunder. Military fascists should know that their mass base has been shaken and their power has passed its peak. The military conspiracy of February 26 was the military fascists' answer to the election of February 20. Clearly, future changes within the army deserve attention, as they may tend toward the further weakening of the position of the Araki faction. The significance of the Tokyo incident shows how acute the struggle within the ruling class camp has become, and has gone far beyond the borders of Japan. If the instigators of such a conspiracy are victorious, the world will face a military disaster. This is already clear, so the question inevitably arises: To what extent will Japan itself and peace in the Far East be guaranteed? Can we prevent the recurrence of similar actions? The world should know that the Goto cabinet will seek a compromise with the offensive military group. The shootings in Tokyo were caused by the entire past policy of Japanese imperialism, and were made possible because the Japanese leadership actually encouraged actions that repeatedly sought to disrupt the peace and tranquility of the Japanese people and the people of East Asia. This kind of event can only be seen in the atmosphere of Japan's constant aggression against its neighbors, and in the atmosphere of failure to punish war provocateurs."

<h3 id="e14">Prime Minister Okada's Escape; The Deceased Was His Brother-in-Law Matsuo <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: After the mutiny incident occurred on the 26th, news of Prime Minister Okada's assassination spread, and all parties were very saddened. Unexpectedly, it was discovered today that Prime Minister Okada is alive and well, and the victim was Prime Minister's brother-in-law, Army Colonel Matsuo.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada stayed in the Imperial Palace after visiting the Emperor yesterday and participated in a Palace meeting on the 29th to discuss the aftermath. After reporters obtained the news of the Prime Minister's survival, they immediately went to Okada's private residence in Tatsumibashi-kakusumicho and met with Secretary Haisaku to inquire about the situation. According to Haisaku, news of the Prime Minister's safe survival was received on the 27th, but this matter was kept strictly confidential. The remains taken from the official residence on the evening of the 27th were those of Major General Matsuo Tsutao, the husband of the Prime Minister's younger sister. Major General Matsuo's voice was very similar to the Prime Minister's, so it is possible that the action troops mistakenly thought he was the Prime Minister himself and killed him. He declined to explain where the Prime Minister has been since the incident occurred.</p>
<p>The Ministry of War announced at 7:00 p.m. today that the statement issued by the Ministry of War at 8:15 p.m. on the 26th regarding Prime Minister Okada's death on the spot has been canceled.</p>
<p>Because Prime Minister Okada survived, the Cabinet issued an order at 4:00 p.m. today, relieving Minister of Home Affairs Goto of his concurrent position as Prime Minister. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Since the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in June of last year, the European collective security movement has gradually become bleak, but in the past month, through the efforts of European diplomats, there has been significant development. The recent approval of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact by the French Chamber of Deputies is the most noteworthy example.</p>
<p>The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is the product of the Soviet-Czech and Soviet-Romanian mutual assistance pacts and is sufficient to create a united front against Germany comprising 27 million soldiers, isolating Germany. It is inevitable that it will be strongly opposed by Hitler. The German government has now issued a statement on this pact, believing that it violates the Locarno Treaty. The scope of mutual assistance under the pact is limited to when one of the two countries is invaded in Europe, while the main content of the Locarno Treaty is to resolve all disputes between Germany and its neighboring France, Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia through peaceful means, and for Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany to mutually guarantee that the borders between Germany and Belgium and Germany and France will never be violated. The spirit of the two pacts is clearly not contradictory but complementary. Moreover, when France and the Soviet Union signed the Mutual Assistance Pact in May of last year, they consulted the governments of Britain and Italy, both of whom expressed their agreement that it did not conflict with the Locarno Treaty. Now, Germany insists that the two are contradictory, attempting to undermine the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, which is not without deeper meaning.</p>
<p>After German leader Hitler announced the rearmament of the military last year, he issued thirteen foreign policy guidelines in the Reichstag. Regarding the Locarno Treaty, he said, "...Germany must also respect the various obligations arising from the Locarno Treaty if they are observed by other signatory countries. As far as the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland is concerned, Germany must also respect this as the most significant burden placed on Germany. However, France has repeatedly concentrated its troops on the border and has not stopped. This must be noted." Although Hitler expressed his respect for the Locarno Treaty, he also used France's attitude as an excuse to leave room for maneuver. Recently, news reports have stated that Germany's military deployment in the Rhineland area is quite active, and there are rumors of preparations to station troops in the demilitarized zone, which means that Germany may want to use the Franco-Soviet Pact as an excuse to make the Locarno Treaty a dead letter.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Locarno Treaty will inevitably lead to war on the European continent, which is what people are generally anxious about. However, even if Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party has the determination for military adventure, it must also make reasonable considerations based on the international environment. The reason why the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact has become an important part of collective security is precisely its significance.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Flag Changed on Mount Emba Aradom; Italian Forces Have a Good Chance of Winning the Invasion of Abyssinia; Loss of Fortress Causes Morale of Abyssinian Army to Plunge; Italian Forces Attack Abyssinian Left Wing from Two Directions <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian flag was planted on the summit of Mount Emba Aradom on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Italian defeat at Adwa. This flag, recently transported from Italy, was planted on the high peak by the father of a military officer who died in 1896. While the First Blackshirt Legion occupied Emba Aradom, the Italian Sarda Division captured Faraga to the east, and the Alpine Division reached Tuggura to the west. Thus, the entire twenty-mile-long mountain ridge is in Italian hands, which is the most dangerous place to attack Abyssinia from the north. The Italian army climbed the mountain and occupied the area without any resistance. It was initially expected that the Italian left wing would begin its advance only after the Danakil and Takkaze zones were cleared. However, because the Abyssinian Emperor's new army came to the rescue from the north, the Italian General Staff decided to attack quickly and achieved this victory. Italian aircraft are now bombing the villages and towns where the Abyssinian Emperor is stationed. The morale of the Abyssinian army is said to have plunged after seeing the remnants of Abyssinian General Mulugo's forces fleeing south. It is generally believed that the Italian victory has determined the future of the war in favor of Italy. The occupation of Emba Aradom has three important implications: Historically, Italy's previous humiliation has been avenged; Politically, the gateway to the south has been opened, and the morale of Abyssinian soldiers and their loyalty to the Abyssinian Emperor will be greatly affected; Militarily, this strategic location is easy to defend and can control all roads from the south to the Tigray and Danakil zones. The Italian army has now begun operations to encircle the troops of Abyssinian Generals Seyoum and Kassa in the Danakil zone. The Italian army has set out from Aksum and other places to outflank the Abyssinian left wing. According to a report from General Badoglio, commander of the Italian forces in East Africa, the battle has been ongoing since dawn on February 28th. Two divisions of the Italian army are attacking Abyssinian General Kassa's army from the north and south. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome: General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Forces, recently issued Public Notice No. 140, stating, "The Italian army on the Eritrean front in the north launched an attack on the troops of Abyssinian General Kassa's forward command from both the north and south at dawn yesterday, February 28. The battle is still ongoing." (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: The Ministry of the Army issued a war report today stating that according to a telegram from General Badoglio, Commander of the Italian Forces in Africa, the Italian First Army Corps has now occupied Emba Aradom. This decisive victory is sufficient to erase the humiliation of General Toselli's defeat in 1896. According to reports, Toselli was the captain of the Fourth Regiment of Eritrea and was defeated by the Abyssinian army at Mount Emba Aradom in 1896, retreating to Adwa, where he eventually died in battle. The Italians were overjoyed upon hearing this victory report today. (28th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Italian army on the northern route occupied Mount Emba Aradom yesterday after fighting a fierce battle with the Abyssinian army for twenty-four hours. This mountain is actually 3,438 meters high and controls all the main roads in central Abyssinia. It is indeed a fortress on the northern route. Now that it has been occupied by the Italian army, it can be used to set up a new position. Even if the Abyssinian army wants to counterattack, it may not be able to do so. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e33">League of Nations to Meet Tomorrow; Oil Embargo to Be Delayed; Impossible to Implement at This Time? Armed Conflict Creates Self-Destruction <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London: The League of Nations' eighteen-nation small committee is scheduled to meet in Geneva on March 2nd to discuss the oil embargo issue. Foreign Minister Eden will go to Geneva on Sunday, March 1st, to attend the meeting. According to general predictions, the committee's discussions will likely result in the creation of another technical committee to study the issue of embargoing other raw materials due to the impossibility of implementing the oil embargo at this time. Previously, the small committee had organized a technical committee to study the oil embargo, and its conclusion was that the embargo would be difficult to implement without the participation of the United States. This conclusion will likely be put on record by the small committee, and the implementation date will be decided when the time is right. However, the embargo on other raw materials (i.e., iron, steel, and coal) was already decided in principle in the resolution passed by the eighteen-nation small committee on November 5th of last year. The implementation will also follow the example of organizing a technical committee to study it. If this procedure is adopted, the activities of the participating sanctioning countries will not be suspended, and the tense situation between those countries and Italy will not be aggravated due to the delayed implementation of the stricter sanctions. This is what the British delegation to the Naval Conference hopes for, as Britain hopes that this delaying tactic will soften Italy's attitude and prevent it from refusing to sign the pact. Diplomatic sources also say that the talk of Italy and Germany working together is rampant. Although this is a tactic and may not be realized, delaying the implementation of stricter sanctions is also enough to prevent Italy and Germany from getting closer. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Two newspapers in Paris and London have published talks of German leader Hitler. In this talk, Hitler directly proposed closer relations with France and warned France that serious consequences would ensue if it ignored this gesture. France is paying close attention to this talk. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, French newspapers are likely to view this proposal with skepticism and doubt the conditions for a genuine approach proposed by Hitler. It is said that France is willing to proceed with the German leader's proposal under the following conditions: Germany rejoins the League of Nations; Germany limits its armaments; and the status quo in Central Europe is fully respected. A Reuters dispatch from Berlin stated that despite the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, Germany still hopes to seek a lasting understanding with France. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The "Deutsche Volksbeobachter," the mouthpiece of Minister of Economics Schacht, recently published a commentary to explain the views of German economic leaders on the diplomatic situation. Between the lines, it hinted at skepticism about the possible results of the Nazi Party's foreign policy and suggested, in polite terms, that the authorities change their foreign policy. It stated, "After Germany's rearmament, its prestige has been restored, but it is essential to understand the extent to which this restored prestige has been destroyed by our country's foreign policy. Germany is currently surrounded, which can be seen in three important reasons: First, the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty; second, the rapprochement between Britain and Russia and the cooling of relations between Britain and Germany; and third, the policies implemented by the Little Entente countries in Central Europe and the Balkans. Regarding the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, the Locarno Pact is bound to be revised. Germany can express its good intentions and offer new guarantees to other countries as an exchange condition, and it can renegotiate the Sky Pact with Britain and France, provided that Germany's equal rights are recognized and the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be effectively resolved. If Italy wins, its economy and finances will need assistance from other countries and will naturally move closer to Britain, which, having no danger to fear after the end of the East African War, will also be happy to do so. As for the relationship between Britain and Russia, Britain's imperialist policy hopes that Russia will not interfere and is willing to maintain peace in Europe in order to confront Japan. The newspaper also denied the claims that Japan and Germany have already concluded a political or military agreement, saying that if Britain gives Germany some benefits in the allocation of raw materials, Germany will certainly be optimistic about certain plans of Britain. Britain will eventually see this. In addition, since the economies of Germany and Russia are interdependent, their relations can return to normal, so that no incident will occur in Europe, which is also in Britain's interest. As for Czech Prime Minister Hodza, although he has made great efforts in the Balkans, it is difficult to form a group from the Czech Republic to the Black Sea to assist in the policy of other countries surrounding Germany, but Germany must be vigilant." (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: All newspapers carried editorials welcoming the French Chamber of Deputies' ratification of the Franco-Soviet pact. Izvestia stated that German newspapers were needlessly alarming and falsely claiming that someone was surrounding Germany. This move was only intended to pre-arrange proof that Germany's current and strengthened aggressive policies were legitimate. The sooner the French Senate ratifies this pact, the more clearly it will show that Germany's intimidation tactics are a waste of effort. If Germany can understand this point, then it can reason with others and have the opportunity to join the collective peace system on its own initiative. The Soviet government, like France, is willing to live peacefully with Germany, and not only does it not want to refuse to accept Germany's reasonable demands for peace, but it even promotes them. The French Chamber of Deputies' decision to reject Germany's threats is a positive factor in consolidating European peace. At a time when far-eastern military fascists are trying to break through all resistance and launch a war, the significance of this pact being ratified is even more important. The consolidation of European peace is also a positive factor in consolidating peace in the Far East. All efforts by Europe, America, and Japan to maintain peace in Eurasia must cooperate most closely, regardless of the actions of military adventurers. The Soviet Union will continue to resolutely pursue its policy of peace and gather all its strength to maintain peace with a calm attitude. However, this policy is by no means aimed at any country. Pravda stated that the French Chamber of Deputies passed the ratification of the Franco-Soviet pact to consolidate peace and strengthen cooperation with the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union is a strong pillar of peace among all countries. The reactionary right wing in France tried to isolate France. They spoke as aggressive forces and German fascist spies to sabotage the pact, but the Chamber of Deputies has already rejected them. In light of the current world situation, there are extremely disturbing events in various countries. During this period, the united efforts of all anti-fascist forces and all anti-war countries have special significance in terms of human destiny. The Franco-Soviet pact is an example of a solution to consolidate collective security and peace. (28th TASS Dispatch)</p>

In addition, it is planned to open two main naval bases on the west coast, one in Milford Haven, Wales, which will be 20 kilometers long, and one in the Firth of Forth.

<p>London: Since Italy expressed its unwillingness to sign the naval agreement, Britain has suggested that Britain, France, and the United States sign an agreement, supplemented by a separate agreement between Britain and Germany. The representatives of France and the United States have already requested instructions from their respective governments. This tripartite agreement is expected to be signed within the next week. Although the French representative has not yet received instructions from his government, it is generally believed that France will not raise significant objections to the tripartite agreement, nor will it require China to inform France of Germany's shipbuilding program after the Anglo-German agreement is concluded, lest Britain reject it. Naval figures also stated that in any future agreement between Britain and Germany, Germany will insist that the terms not be communicated to other countries, and will use this as a condition for signing the agreement. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>London: The future progress of the naval conference depends on the French delegation. The delegation is currently seeking instructions from Paris on whether to continue the tripartite negotiations. It is reported that France hopes to obtain an understanding that Italy will be willing to sign the naval treaty when the Italo-Ethiopian issue is resolved. Both Italy and France have no major concerns regarding the technical aspects of drafting the treaty, so it is expected that an understanding between France and Italy will facilitate the treaty's conclusion. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>London: After Italy refused to sign the naval agreement yesterday, Britain suggested that Britain, France, and the United States sign a naval treaty. The French representative has already requested instructions from his government. Once instructions from Paris arrive, Britain and France can continue their talks. Naval conference personnel generally believe that France may accept the signing of a tripartite treaty, but on the condition that it receives some satisfaction on the issue of battleships. Satisfaction could mean reducing the 35,000-ton figure, or, even if not reducing it, shortening its validity period. In addition, France also intends to propose a method to be included in the naval treaty so that Italy can sign and join it when it deems appropriate. Regarding the issue of Britain and Germany signing a naval treaty, the German Ambassador to Britain, Herr von Hoesch, has requested instructions from his government on what is appropriate. Once instructions from Berlin arrive, Britain and Germany will also continue their talks. According to naval figures, Germany will definitely accept signing, but beforehand will request to know the final terms of the treaty from Britain. Furthermore, Germany also wants to know whether the Soviet Union will also sign and participate, and what intentions it holds. Regarding the issue of the Soviet Union signing and participating, it is now known that Britain and the Soviet Union have held talks, but only to exchange information, and no further discussions have been made. (The Soviet representative is Colonel Tkachenko, Naval Attaché at the Soviet Embassy in Britain.) (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to information obtained by this agency's diplomatic correspondent, Italy has already stated its refusal to sign the future naval treaty. Therefore, France believes that unless guarantee clauses are added to the treaty to reserve leeway for the French Navy, France cannot accept signing it. Regarding this matter, the French delegation to the naval conference has requested instructions from the government. This afternoon, Deputy Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Massigli, held talks with the Minister of the Navy, Pietri. It is now known that after these talks, these instructions will largely be sent to London tonight. It is reported that the instructions will order the delegation to negotiate with the Italian delegation to ensure that Italy issues a formal document stating that even if it does not sign the treaty, it will still promise to be bound by its terms. In the event that Italy rejects this request, then guarantee clauses should be added to the naval treaty to reserve leeway for the French Navy, and then France can accept signing it. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here still believes that after the meeting of the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen, Italy may change its decision regarding the signing issue. In addition, France has another objection regarding the method of signing a tripartite treaty, which is related to the conditions for Germany's participation in signing. What France requires is that Germany, based on the treaty drafted by Britain and Germany, should notify Britain of the shipbuilding program, and Britain should then notify France. It is expected that next week, when Foreign Minister Flandin meets with British Foreign Secretary Eden in Geneva, he will specifically mention this point. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>London: According to information obtained by this agency's reporter, the Italian Chief Delegate to the naval conference, Ambassador Grandi, has informed Foreign Secretary Eden that Italy has no objection if Britain, France, and the United States sign a naval treaty. This morning, he also met with the American Chief Delegate, Davis, and stated that Italy cannot sign the naval treaty "under the current circumstances." He said that the technical objections raised by Italy are not irreparable, and that the reason for refusing to sign is actually due to the continued implementation of sanctions and the continued pressure of the British Navy on Italy in the Mediterranean. It is generally believed that after Grandi presented the above explanation, American sympathy for Italy's position has increased. Davis then met with Foreign Secretary Eden in the afternoon to discuss the situation regarding the signing of the naval treaty by the three countries. According to information obtained by this agency's reporter, Eden informed Davis of the position taken by Germany regarding the signing of the British naval treaty, saying that Germany is now waiting for France to provide a response before making a concrete decision. It is said that Germany has raised several technical objections, but their nature is not important and they are easy to resolve. In addition, the French representative, Rear Admiral Robert, met with Italian Rear Admiral Piglia, and Piglia explained Italy's position, stating that not only is formal signing rejected, but even initialing is not desired. It is heard that if the sanctions are not lifted for one day, even if the Committee of Eighteen does not decide to intensify sanctions, Italy's above attitude will not change for one day.

<p>Washington: A delegation representing shipyards on the Pacific coast today went to the House Naval Affairs Committee to request that the shipbuilding industry on both coasts be given a 6% advantage in the construction of 54 auxiliary vessels. They cited the situation of the US fleet in the Pacific and the Far East to prove the necessity of restoring the shipbuilding industry on the west coast. Mrs. Kahn, a member of the delegation, stated that "If we have eyes but do not pay attention to the situation in the Pacific, the harm is much greater than having no eyes. This is a matter of self-defense, and the Naval Affairs Committee cannot ignore it." Another representative, named Torrence, also said, "A single spark can start a prairie fire. A world war could break out at any moment. If a war breaks out, everyone knows where it will come from. Think about our position when a war breaks out in the Pacific. If the Panama Canal has any accident, how can ships on the west coast sail to the east coast for repairs?"

<p>Tianjin: A strong northwest wind rose on the night of the 28th. The Taku Bar lightship and nine vessels, including the stranded "Changcheng Maru" and "Chosho Maru," were blown out to sea. On the 29th, the "Tianxing" tried to force her way outside to investigate. The "Changcheng" and "Chosho" had already sailed to Dalian. The "Zhonghe," "Chang'an," and "Zengli" drifted ten nautical miles outside the port, fortunately without danger. The whereabouts of the "Haiming" and four other vessels are unknown, and various parties are searching for them. After the lightship drifted away, there were no navigation marks, and all vessels were afraid of danger when entering and leaving the port, so they stopped sailing. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: After days of tides, the brash ice inside and outside the Xiaodagu cannot be broken. Although the northwest wind is strong, it is of no help. The Tianjin shipping industry again dispatched Wang Gengsan as a representative to the Haihe Engineering Bureau on the 29th to negotiate the prompt concentration of icebreaking vessel force to break the ice first, so that the wind blows it out of the port and open the waterway. The Haihe Engineering Bureau's ice-cleaning, ice-diving, and ice-breaking vessels are all frozen solid near the Heigu and Dagu Forts. It is necessary to rent another vessel to break the ice. (Special dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The ships trapped outside Dagu are now in greater danger, because the northwest wind is strong, and the ice floes are moved by the wind, carrying the ships out to sea. According to news obtained here tonight, the ships trapped in Dagu are no longer visible. It is believed that there are two Taikoo ships and two Japanese ships among them, as well as several Chinese merchant vessels. The customs vessel "Haining" has also drifted out to sea with the ice. People in the shipping industry are now very anxious. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The missing vessels blown away by the wind are the Taku Bar lightship of the Tianjin Customs, and three other vessels belonging to the British Taikoo Company. No news has been received either. The Tianjin Shipping Company dispatched the "Tianxing" on the 1st to sail outside the port again to search. On the 29th, the "Tianxing" worked outside Dagu for eight hours. By the evening, it had rescued the Japanese vessel "Ruzan Maru" and the "Shunli" of the Zhengji Company, and had provided food and coal to other trapped vessels. As of the evening of the 29th, the wind direction outside Dagu was still northwest, but the ice was thick and solid. The ice mountains in the Tanggu-Dagu section were stacked on top of each other and could not be blown out of the port, so the ships trapped outside the port could have sailed in, but because the ice inside the port had not melted, they could not move forward.

<h3 id="e86">Professor of the University of Paris Discusses China's Current Situation Again; Construction in Various Aspects is Actively Underway <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Professor Aiscara of the Faculty of Law and the Chinese College of the University of Paris, who once served as a legal advisor to the Chinese government and is well-versed in Chinese affairs, recently made a statement to our reporter, saying that China has its inherent virtues, passed down through generations and becoming a model. However, adhering to outdated rules has led to stagnation, while its neighboring nations have been very active. Under their pressure, China has had to make concessions, resulting in unequal treaties that the majority of the Chinese people cannot tolerate. Therefore, the main problem in China today is to revise traditional ideas to suit the current trend. Construction in various aspects within China is now actively underway. Although there are many aspects, they are closely connected. In terms of economic construction, the Chinese people have gradually realized the importance of this endeavor. Therefore, all efforts are being steadily implemented. I have stayed in China for four years and have witnessed various improvements. There are now many model cities, such as Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Beiping, and Shanghai. The streets are clean and tidy, without a single piece of paper. In rural areas, where new-style medicine was previously unknown, health movements are now being actively carried out, and model villages are springing up everywhere. The civil servants in various institutions are young and energetic and are able to be loyal to their duties and serve the public interest. The progress in transportation is particularly noteworthy. For example, within Shandong Province, 6,500 kilometers of highways have been built in two years, with 800 buses operating regularly. The domestic aviation industry has also made rapid progress, which is very efficient in business. In terms of education, schools are springing up in remote areas, and all children know that cleanliness and orderliness can demonstrate patriotism. All of this is true and not an exaggeration. In addition, China's political construction and economic revival are proceeding hand in hand, with the aim of building a strong central government in accordance with the principles advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Furthermore, China has always valued culture and morality, and a new movement has now emerged in this area, namely the "New Life Movement," which aims to prevent traditional ideas from being lost and to adapt them to the needs of the new era. It has spread widely and has achieved great results. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e91">Geography Lecture: Why We Should Study Foreign Geography (3) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Guozhang, Professor of the Department of Geography, Central University</p>
<p>From what has been said above, we can know that Japan's relations with China have their own special geographical background. If we want to have a considerable understanding of Japan's international relations, we must first have a considerable understanding of Japanese geography. This is only in terms of Japan. The situation of other countries is mostly the same. Although the international situation is ever-changing, its roots are all geographical factors. The United Kingdom helped Abyssinia to resist Italy, on the one hand, to protect the route to the Far East, and on the other hand, to protect the water source of the upper Nile so as not to affect the agriculture along the lower Nile within the territory, while Italy, which is established on the peninsula, is either a mountainous area or a barren land except for the northern sandy river basin. Mineral resources are scarce, and the production of raw materials is extremely rare. A large part of them depends on foreign imports, so the war of aggression against A attracted the economic severance of 38 members of the League of Nations. Although the implementation of this economic sanction has been less than two months, the pain felt in Italy has been very deep. The soaring prices of everything have become a very common phenomenon. Daily necessities are strictly tightened. The original three meals a day are now changed to two meals. Government agencies have shortened office hours, stores have also shortened business hours, and elevators in each household have mostly been abandoned. Electric trains will also reduce the number of trains in order to save electricity; public buses will also be temporarily suspended to save petroleum, and the government extremely encourages walking, and other situations can be imagined. This further proves the close relationship between the countries now. It is agreed that the world has become a whole unit in terms of economy. No country can exist alone, and the importance of foreign geographical knowledge is self-evident.</p>
<p>The second reason for studying foreign geography is to understand China's position in the international community. A country's international status has a deep relationship with the three elements of establishing a country, namely, land, people, and the common national concept of the people. The so-called land includes land ownership, the size of the land area, the productivity of the land, the underground wealth, natural protection, internal natural communication, external natural connection, and the position of the land on the ground, etc. These are all questions that must be considered in geography: The so-called people include the number of people, the size of the people's ability to use nature (the degree of education and the progress of economic construction, etc.), the size of the people's purchasing power (the size of the market and the cost of wages, etc.), the nature of the people (obedience, fear, fortitude, decisiveness, etc.), and the ethnicity to which the people belong, etc. These are also all questions that must be addressed in geography; As for the common national concept of the people, it is a product of the interrelationship between the people and the land, because no matter which country's people, most of the daily necessities they need are due to their use of the land of their own country. They have the deepest knowledge and the most concern for the land of their own country. Only from this deep understanding and concern can a common national concept be aroused.</p>
<p>A good government can promote the interrelationship between the people and the land of the whole country. Personal power is limited, and it is impossible to deal with nature alone in everything. For example, the improvement of water conservancy, the improvement of transportation, the improvement and selection of seeds and livestock, the promotion of products, and many other similar problems all depend on the cooperation of the majority of the people. And there must also be a good government to make overall plans for the people, supervise and promote them, and do their best to protect them, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and people can be used to their fullest extent. Moreover, the needs of the people's lives will never be fully supplied by the local area. In addition to a part of the supply from abroad, most of it is taken from other parts of the country. From the perspective of economic organization, a country is actually a whole economic unit. If we rely solely on the strength of the people and there is no good government to use the strength of the people to deal with all aspects of nature, how can we enable the people of the whole country to make appropriate use of the land of the whole country and collect mutually beneficial effects? How can it make the people of the whole country feel a sense of interdependence and inseparability from every part of the country, thereby cultivating a common national concept, so all the facilities of a good government, whether internal or external, should be aimed at increasing the ability of the people to use the land, thereby improving the living conditions of the people, so I can say that the common national concept arises from the interrelationship between the people and the land, and a good government is sufficient to promote the interrelationship between the people and the land.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win every battle." Establishing a country under the current complex international situation, it is agreed that there must be clarity in knowing yourself and your enemy. Those who hold political power must understand the international status of the country's land and people, and the degree of development of the common national concept of the people, and the general people should also have a considerable understanding of this. The geography of one's own country focuses on knowing oneself, and the geography of foreign countries focuses on knowing the other, but in addition to knowing the other, one understands oneself even more deeply. The international status of one's own country can only be reflected after understanding foreign geography, and the country's foreign policy has a certain goal. Now, compare the United States and China to see the importance of the two countries in the international community.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between China and the United States, the most important of which are eight: The two countries are located at the same latitude. The coastlines of both countries are very long, and they both have good harbors and easy access to various places. Both countries have large river basins suitable for agriculture and are the world's main agricultural countries. Both countries are countries that can be self-sufficient in food. Both countries are agricultural export countries. Both countries have abundant mineral resources, which are sufficient for the development of heavy industry. Both countries are rich in manpower. Both countries are rich in natural water power.</p>
<p>As for the differences between the two countries, they can be explained in two aspects: (A) Aspects in which China exceeds the United States: China's area is larger than that of the United States by a ratio of 4:3 to 3.7. China's population is more than three times that of the United States, with a ratio of 45 to 1. The number of Chinese farmers is eight to nine times that of the United States. China's main agricultural products have a larger output than the United States, including rice, soybeans, sorghum, and millet. China's mineral products that are more abundant than those of the United States include antimony, tungsten, and tin. China's natural defense situation is more favorable than that of the United States, with high mountains, deserts, and plateaus in the northwest, and a coastline in the southeast with layers of protection. (B) Aspects in which the United States exceeds China: The area of ​​cultivated land in the heavenly kingdom is one-half times larger than that of China. The average area of ​​cultivated land obtained by each farmer in the United States is 40 times larger than that in China. The main agricultural crops in the United States that are more abundant than those in China include wheat, cotton, tobacco, and corn. The mineral products in the United States, such as coal, are 20 times more abundant than those in China, pig iron is 50 times more abundant than those in China, and the difference between oil and copper mines is even greater. The number of factory workers in the United States is ten times that of China. The number of railway miles in the United States is more than 20 times that of China. The number of automobile miles in the United States is 50 times that of China. The number of sea vessel tonnage in the United States is five times that of China. The number of spindles in the United States is nine times that of China. The number of textile machines in the United States is 21 times that of China. The value of foreign export trade in the United States is nine times that of China; the value of import trade is five times that of China. The average value of foreign trade per person in the United States is 20 times that of China.</p>
<p>From such a simple comparison, we can see the importance of the position of China and the United States in the international community. At the same time, we can also see that the various conditions in the natural environment of China and the United States are not far apart, and are generally very similar. The biggest difference between the two countries is almost entirely in the human aspect. In other words: China's land is favorable, but the Chinese people are not as capable as the Americans in using its benefits, which has led to a huge difference in the position of China and the United States in the international community. What about the comparison of the international status of China and Britain, China and France, China and Germany, China and Japan, China and Russia, and China and other countries in the world? Of course, it can only be seen by studying foreign geography.</p>
<p>This kind of comparison not only reveals the weaknesses of our country, but also shows the advantages of our country. For example, the large population of our country is the crown of the world, and we can use this advantage to improve our country's position in the international community. As long as we use scientific new inventions to develop the rich resources of our country and develop various industries, so that the 450 million people in the country can produce an average of one more yuan of goods per year, we can increase the value of human living materials in the world by 450 million yuan; at the same time, if each person can buy an average of one yuan more goods per year, it can increase the purchasing power of the world by 450 million yuan; in other words, it is equal to increasing the total value of trade in the world by several hundred million yuan. If this number is distributed to the world's 2 billion people, each person can get an average of 45 cents. The higher our productivity and purchasing power, the greater the impact on the international market. In addition, our country also has many unique mineral products such as antimony and tungsten mines; there are also many agricultural products that occupy a very superior position in the world market, such as tung oil, soybeans, raw silk, cotton, tea, peanuts, etc.; as long as we can use cheap labor to increase the output of goods and improve the quality of goods, our country's position on the international stage can definitely be improved.

<p>18.  Coal Mines and Porcelain Industry in Tongguan</p>
<p>Two hundred and forty li northwest of Shaanxi, along the Xianyu Highway directly to Tongguan County, the county has been known for its coal and porcelain industries. The mineral layers are abundant, and the coal quality is pure. Since the Longhai Railway directly reaches Xi'an, various emerging machine industries need coal. Therefore, it is an urgent task to develop national resources and open up the northwest frontier by designing scientific methods to mine coal. Tongguan porcelain, from the Song Dynasty to the present, is sold in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The texture is hard and can reflect the Jingdezhen porcelain in the north and south. The people of the Northwest have always liked to buy and use it, but foreign goods are flooding in, making it easy to be squeezed out and gradually eliminated. If it is not improved, it will be difficult to expand sales, and the status of the porcelain industry will be completely robbed by imported goods. The following is a record of the mining of coal mines and the manufacturing of porcelain industry. (A) Coal Mine: Tongguan Coal Mine starts from Tongshugou in the west, and extends northeast along Longtou Mountain, passing through Chenlu Town in the middle, and ending at Chenjiahe, with a total length of 120 li. There are more than 30 coal kilns in the county. It is said that the coal mine there was unusually developed ten years ago. Since the 18th year of the Republic of China, it has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and most of the coal kilns have declared Hele. At present, there are only more than ten places such as Huiduipo, Xincun, and Chenjiahe. However, the coal seams in each place are very rich. The coal well is about 190 feet to 380 feet deep. There are one or two layers of coal seams, and the layer thickness is 5 feet to 3 zhang. For example, the coal in Huiduipo has two layers, each layer is 5 feet thick, the coal in Chenjiahe is 1 zhang and 2 feet thick, and the coal in Bailing is 3 zhang thick. The remaining coal seams are 7 or 8 feet thick on average. As for the East Kiln Town mud coal, it is 9 inches thick. Each kiln produces more than 3 tons of coal per day. According to the local price, each ton is worth 5 yuan. The organization of the coal nest has no large-scale coal factory. Except for those who operate independently, most of them jointly mine and sell separately. That is, a coal well is owned by several families. According to the number of shares, the labor cost of going to the bottom of the well is divided, and the coal produced by Quan Huan is distributed according to the number of inputs. The mining method is the oldest manual mining. Underground workers use iron tools to excavate. A huge pulley is placed at the wellhead, and eight people per class turn it up by manpower. Each resolution can take up to 200 catties of coal. Except for Huiduipo and Xincun, the coal reserves of the Siguan Coal Cellar are particularly rich. Cars and mule carts can drive directly into the interior, which is very convenient for mining and transportation. (B) Porcelain Industry: Tongguan porcelain, those who engage in the porcelain industry do not have sufficient capital, and are struggling with life. For all products, they only seek to ship goods quickly, and do not seek exquisite production. Most of the important works such as painting and glazing are entrusted to women and child laborers to perfunctorily deal with the matter. Daily production is calculated entirely by numbers, regardless of the quality of the beauty. As a result, the products are becoming more and more inferior. The original places of porcelain production were Huangbao, Lidi, Shangdian, Chenlu and other towns. Today, only Chenlu Town remains. The business is still good. Among them, the porcelain of Huangbao Town has the earliest history. It was founded in the Yongzhong period of the Jin Dynasty and stopped operating in the Xining period of the Song Dynasty. The porcelain products produced are also very wonderful, with delicate patterns. The existing porcelain can be sold at a high price for buying antiques, and it is regarded as a rare treasure. The organization of the kiln industry, there are four types of porcelain making in the Chenlu Town area: Bowl Kiln, specializing in burning bowls, dishes, etc.; Black Kiln, specializing in burning pots, urns, jars, cans, etc.; Urn Kiln, specializing in burning urns, large vats, large basins, etc.; Small Goods Kiln, specializing in burning bottles, pots, cups, inkstones, and miscellaneous small items, etc. Different categories are separated, and each does not interfere with the other. The soil used is all mined from the mountains in this area, and the coal burned is also produced locally. Unfortunately, the manufacturing still adheres to the old method of manual pottery firing. For example, when making bowls, the raw materials of the porcelain clay are placed on the stone, and another wooden stick is used to press and move the stone to rotate. Each push makes a bowl and takes it to be burned. This way of shipping goods is not only not fast, but also rough in production. It seems that it should be greatly improved. There are about 300 to 400 households in the kiln area, and there are 120 to 130 kiln caves, most of which are buildings from the Song Dynasty. There are less than 10 large kilns, about 30 medium-sized kilns, and 60 to 70 small kilns. Each kiln is built with an average of more than 10,000 bricks, and it can be burned twice a year, which is worth 1,500 to 600 yuan. According to statistics, the annual turnover is quite large, about more than 200,000.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Lu Provincial Government Takes Over Lufeng Yarn Factory Lufeng Stopped Work on February 9 After the Provincial Government Takes Over, It Will Continue to Operate <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication, Lufeng Yarn Factory, is the largest and earliest yarn factory in Lu Province's private sector. In the past, its business was very prosperous for a while. However, in recent years, science and technology have advanced by leaps and bounds, and new machines have emerged one after another. Therefore, the existing machinery in the factory is outdated and old. Not only does it consume a lot, but the production is also small. In addition, the manager of the factory is not good at management. On February 9 this year, it was announced that the factory would be shut down. More than 2,000 workers suddenly lost their jobs. They have repeatedly sent representatives to the provincial authorities to request that the factory be ordered to start work quickly in order to maintain their livelihood. The authorities also believe that the factory has defaulted on a loan of 670,000 yuan from Minsheng Bank, which has not been repaid. It is a big problem to add so many unemployed people to the society. In order to maintain the livelihood of these unemployed workers and the continued existence of this great enterprise, Miao Xingcun, a provincial government consultant and chairman of the Jinan Grain Association and general manager of Chengtong Yarn Factory, was sent to take over the factory. Miao believed that the legal issues such as the share capital of the yarn factory and the debts of Minsheng Bank had not been resolved, so the takeover matters needed to be considered. Before the takeover, the three departments of the Department of Finance, the Department of Construction, and the Department of Finance decided that Minsheng Bank would invest money and Miao Xingcun would lease it on behalf of the bank, paying a certain amount of rent every month. The profits and losses would be borne by Chengtong Yarn Factory. On the morning of the 8th, Gong Xingcun immediately went to the factory with Police Commander Wu Huawen. In addition to counting the machinery accounts one by one, Gong Xingcun personally spoke to all the employees, and the factory would officially start work within days. As for how the factory will proceed in the future, it is said that Miao Xingcun intends to follow the spirit of running the Chengtong Yarn Factory, improving Lufeng, striving to increase production and reduce consumption, and using one year as the deadline for rectification, depending on the results, and then deciding everything (28th).</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jiaoji Railway Shortens Travel Time <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>——And Will Add Qingjing or Qinghu Through Train—— Jinan Communication, Jiaoji Railway cooperated with Jinpu Beineng Railways last year and implemented Qingping through train. After three months, it was suspended. It is now planned to resume it from April 1 to facilitate passengers on both sides. The Jiaoji Railway is recently planning to shorten the travel time between Jiqing sections 21 and 22, so that the train can arrive in Ji early to connect with the Jinpu Railway train. The Jiaoji Railway Bureau has scheduled a meeting on the 8th in Qingdao to convene the heads of each section of the entire railway's train machinery to study the problem of shortening the time. It is heard that it is planned to open Qingdao section 21 and Qinan section 21 every day at 1:30 pm. It takes 9 hours to travel to the destination at 10:30 pm (the current 12 fast train takes 9 and a half hours to arrive). No extra charge will be charged, and free tickets may also be applicable. Passengers can have a morning of leisure in Qingdao or Jinan to handle affairs and complete them before getting on the train again. They don't have to stay on the train for the month, which is extremely convenient for passengers. The method of shortening the travel time is because each passenger train must stop at each station to allow passengers to get on and off, or to load and unload goods. In the future, the 21st and 22nd trains will decide not to stop at small stations, and only stop at large stations such as Jinan Huang. Stop at larger stations such as Zaozhuang, Zhoucun Zhangdian, Xindian, Qingzhou, Changle or Weixian, Fangzi, Zuoshan, Gaomi, Jiaozhou, Chengyang, etc. to Cangkou, Sifang, Qingdao. At the same time, the bureau also pays attention to the passengers at each small station. Since the 21st and 22nd small stations do not stop, passengers at small stations will feel inconvenient. It is planned to add two additional trains to provide assistance, one from Qingdao to Weixian and one from Jinan to Fangzi, which will depart at 10:30 am every day. If this is done, passengers can be facilitated, but cargo may be slightly affected. Yang Chengxun, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, went to Qingdao the day before to discuss with Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Commission, and Shen Hong, mayor of Qingdao, and planned to add Qingdao-Nanjing or Qingdao-Shanghai through trains, imitating the Qingping through train method. One or two cars are hung on a certain train every day, and they are transferred to Jinan and hung on a certain train to the destination to facilitate passengers. In addition, the Jiaoji Railway had the worst business performance in the six months from June to the end of last year, losing more than 1 million yuan. After the New Year, the business turned better due to the active coal transportation, reaching a maximum of 58,000 yuan per day. Therefore, the current situation is still optimistic (27th).</p>

<p>Labor Service to Build the Ring Road</p>
<p>The county government convened a meeting the day before to implement labor services in all circles this year and decided to build the roadbed of the Tongpo Road Ring Road connection section. The entire line requires 14,196 cubic meters of earthwork, which will be undertaken by 378 people, each with 12 cubic meters. The remaining insufficient number will be supplemented by mountain nomads, criminals, and tenant farmers under detention. It is scheduled to be held at 9 am on March 5th, gathering at Dongzhai in front of the mountain and immediately mobilizing to start work. At the latest by the end of March, all must be completed and County Magistrate Peng and Special Commissioner Zhu were elected as the leaders and deputy leaders to command everything. The 8th District Office of the county was ordered to handle the re-registration of reformed smokers, which was still considered diligent. A total of more than 180 smokers were registered. However, the county government suddenly received a secret report that Zhou, a clerk at the sub-office of the district, smoked opium, colluded with Director Ma Sicai and Wanyiang Township Chief Yang Ying, used the pseudonym Ma Liang, fabricated household registrations, falsely issued applications, and blindly received smoke certificates. After the county government sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts, the opium-smoking clerk of the sub-office was dismissed and ordered to quit smoking. The smoke should be immediately revoked. Director Ma Sicai and Township Chief Yang Qingxi were each given a major demerit as a light punishment.</p>

A doctor has been hired and it is scheduled to start inspection from the 1st, which will be completed in about a week.</p>
<p>Business Tax Bureau Collects Taxes Directly</p>
<p>The business tax of various businesses in Suzhou has always been paid by the stores to the relevant industry associations, which are collected by the county chamber of commerce and transferred to the Business Tax Bureau. This method has been in place for several years. Recently, Feng Zhenya, the newly appointed director of the Business Tax Bureau, changed the collection method. From yesterday, he sent personnel to the streets to collect taxes from various stores. This collection is the spring tax of this year, but most of the stores have already paid it to the relevant industry associations and are preparing to collect it. Therefore, when the bureau staff sent personnel to collect taxes, they all reported it accordingly, but the bureau staff said that it must be collected directly. As a result, the stores reported to the relevant industry associations and reported to the chamber of commerce. The chamber of commerce was afraid that this would cause disputes. After discussing with the Standing Committee, it was decided to convene a general meeting of all members at 2 pm on March 3 to discuss countermeasures. The relevant industry associations and representatives of the store staff have been notified separately to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>The Cinema Machine Operator Died of Electric Shock</p>
<p>Ni Aliuliu, the machine operator of the engine room of Yinxing Cinema in Jiaxing City, accidentally touched an electric shock while wiping the machine at about 6 pm on the 28th and died instantly. By the time he was noticed, there was no way to save him. The deceased was nearly forty years old and was a native of Taiping Township in this port. He was quite diligent in his work. He still has a wife and daughter at home who depend on him for their livelihood. The hospital immediately informed his family to come to the hospital that night and tried to coffin them on the 29th. The Jiaxing County Government convened 60% of the chiefs of the county, a total of 53 people, for centralized training, and set the 28th as the registration date. Many township chiefs came to the city to register on that day. As of the evening, there were already more than 200 people, but township chiefs who lived far away had to come to the city to register on the 29th. Township chiefs in the city were also urged by the county government to report to their offices by telephone. It was also stipulated that they would be compiled into a "One Brigade" and "One Independent Brigade" and hired trainers to start training from March 1.</p>

<p>A Cruel Mother-in-law Abuses Daughter-in-law, Leading to Murder</p>
<p>From Tianning Village in this county, the overbearing village head, Ji Dasheng, married a wife, Xu, known for her extreme brutality, a source of widespread disapproval in the neighborhood. Four years ago, for his son, Erguan, he married the daughter of Chen Zhongnan, from the same village. After she entered the family, she suffered abuse. Recently, the cruelty intensified, with incessant scolding and beatings, showing utter disregard. Chen, unable to endure it any longer, secretly left through the back door late on the twenty-sixth, going to the Datong Bridge pond and throwing herself into the clear waters. Her body floated to the surface at dawn, causing widespread commotion. Her mother, Lü, upon hearing the news, rushed to the Ji household and initiated a major dispute. Ji Dasheng and his wife went into hiding to avoid her. Lü has filed a complaint with the county court, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Robbery of a Large Sum of Money, Arrest on the Spot</p>
<p>Gu Hongxun, a money collector for the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, was carrying over 7,300 yuan from the Hangzhou Electric Company in front of the Drum Tower at 10:00 AM on the twenty-eighth. He was returning to the bank by rickshaw when Lin Xiang, the director of the Shanghai Laundry Company in Tongchunfang, due to poor business and substantial debts, also went to the electric company to address the electric meter. Seeing the money, he conceived a criminal idea. He pursued them in a hired car, unexpectedly snatching the leather bag from Gu's hand and speeding away in the car. Fortunately, rickshaw puller Chen Ada, witnessing the event, exerted all his strength to chase after them, crashing into Lin's hired car. Gu managed to apprehend him, and together with the stolen goods, he was taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Qianjiang Bridge to Be Completed Next Year</p>
<p>Construction of the Qiantang River Bridge last year was significantly affected by unusually large autumn tides. However, after the bridge construction office actively accelerated the work, two bridge piers on the south bank have recently been completed. Five bridge piers on the north bank are currently under construction separately. A large amount of materials such as steel beams and cement has been transported to the site. The pile-driving barges in the river center are operating swiftly and intensely as the machinery has been fully equipped. It is now understood that the entire bridge project, originally scheduled for completion at the end of this year, has been delayed by eight months and is now expected to be completed by the end of June next year.</p>

<h3 id="e106">New Regulations for Telephone in Concessions Implemented from Midnight Tonight Metering Charges for Numbers Exceeding Allotment Post Office Does Not Accept Proposal to Organize Communication Vehicles City Federation Continues to Support Telephone Issue Committee <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The new regulations of the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concessions, despite repeated objections from various sectors, have ultimately been implemented effectively. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the company yesterday morning and learned that the new regulations, after being approved by the Public Concession’s工部局and the French Concession’s公董局, will equip all 48,671 subscribers’ lines with a meter. This project has already been completed and will be activated after twelve o'clock last night. Any telephone that dials five consecutive numbers and receives a response from the other party will be charged once by the meter. However, due to difficulties in dialing, "01," calls to major venues, city centers, Jiangwan, Wusong, Nanshi, Zhabei, Nanxiang, Zhenru, Pudong, Longhua, Baoshan “02”, and long-distance calls “03”, inquiries “09”, will generally not be counted. City area calls and long-distance calls will still be handled according to previous regulations. Monthly fees are paid in advance, and overage fees are settled in the following month. Business telephones pay ten yuan and can make 150 metered calls. Residential telephones pay six yuan and fifty cents and can make 100 metered calls. Overage fees are three cents per metered call. The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, due to ineffective negotiations, has scheduled a joint meeting of various groups on the afternoon of March 10 to prepare for dissolution.</p>
<p>Statement from Taxpayers' Association A spokesperson for the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association stated to reporters yesterday that the association has never expressed "approval or acceptance" of the Shanghai Telephone Company's new price list. This should be solemnly declared. As for the association's so-called expression of facts, to avoid misunderstandings, it must be explained that if users support the directors' compromise proposal or the proposal of the Telephone Issue Committee, when the telephone company absolutely does not change its attitude, the fact of "not using" should be used to make the telephone company realize its error. Facts are better than words, and reality is the golden rule. In short, if the association encounters any entrustment from users, it will fulfill its responsibilities and strive to the utmost, and will never "shirk responsibility."</p>
<p>Post Office Replies to Telephone Association The Postal Administration replied to the Telephone Issue Committee stating, "Your letter of the 25th of this month has been received and duly noted. After review, your requests to organize communication vehicles and print communication cards, with a uniform fee of one cent each, conflict with the bureau's operations and are not feasible. Your members can use postal postcards for communication within the city. Each postcard is charged only one cent within the city and is delivered according to the ordinary delivery schedule. If faster delivery is required, postcards or letters can be sent as regular express mail. Each item will be charged an additional five cents for regular express fees (regular express postcards within the city cost a total of six cents including postage, and letters cost seven cents. The envelope should be marked '平快 [Regular Express]'). The bureau will arrange for a mail carrier to deliver them according to the express mail delivery schedule to ensure speed. A corresponding reply is hereby provided for your information."</p>
<p>Public Opinion of the City Federation District branches 5, 7, 15, 24, 25, 36, 38, 39 of the Special District Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the Special District Telephone Issue Committee yesterday, stating: "Having seen in the newspapers that the Chinese Taxpayers' Association has indicated that the new Shanghai Telephone Company fees are sufficient for users' needs, this Committee believes that this action is self-contradictory. Therefore, this letter is a rebuttal and proposes to schedule a meeting to announce its dissolution and inform users that if they have any requests in the future, they can directly consult the Association, etc. Your Committee is organized by various groups in the city, with the will of the public as its guide and the pursuit of public interest as its premise, not for the private views of individuals. Moreover, the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association is the general organization of taxpayers in the special district, entrusted by citizens to participate in the 工部局administrative affairs and represent the taxpayers' views in negotiations. Its every word and action has a significant impact. Instead of striving to expand forward, it has put unfounded words into writing. This Association, etc., regrets this very much. Therefore, we jointly urge your Committee to continue its past spirit, fight to the end, uphold the spirit of dauntless sacrifice, and bravely move forward to fight for the users of the city. Our Association, etc., is willing to be your backup. As for announcing dissolution, we will not agree to it until victory is achieved. We urge all members to do their best to overcome the difficulties in order to achieve thorough success. We deeply hope for this."</p>

<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group convened a second cadre meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Cai Shengbai, Pan Yangyao, Xiang Kangyuan, Fang Jiange, Hu Xiyuan, Wu Yunqi, Wang Zhisheng, Mao Heyuan, Du Bingshou, Xie Jishan, Shi Gengyin, and Wu Qingtai.

<p>Regarding the gift of toothpaste and toothbrushes from the Family Industry Cooperative, it was resolved that a letter of thanks will be sent.</p>
<p>Welcome from Guizhou Governor Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, sent a telegram to the group yesterday to express his welcome. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, Mr. Guo Shun, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Industrial Federation, upon reading your telegram, I learned that gentlemen are the backbone of the industry, coming together to guide us from afar. Awaiting enlightenment with utmost welcome. Huang Xuchu respectfully bows, frugal."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reception At 3:00 PM, the City Chamber of Commerce hosted a reception for all members of the group. More than twenty people attended, accompanied by Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Chamber, and Zhu Boyuan, Secretary. First, Chairman Yu gave a speech, saying, "The Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group is organized by industrial and commercial magnates of this city and will depart from Shanghai on the fourth of next month. Our Chamber, as the collective body of all merchants in the city, regards the mission of your group with a sense of shared destiny and holds great expectations. Therefore, as you are about to depart, we have prepared some refreshments and invited you to attend to express our farewell sentiments. Your presence is deeply gratifying. There are many reasons for the industrial and commercial decline in our city in recent years, but the gradual shrinking of the market is the most fatal wound. The four northeastern provinces are completely closed off, and even Jiangsu Province is gradually becoming a situation where guests overshadow the hosts. In Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, Shanghai merchants suffer not only from the failure to abolish disguised likin but also from the industrial control of provincial self-government, so that Shanghai factories can only confine themselves to the corner of Central China. This is currently the biggest issue. Regarding taxation, the exemption of grain surtaxes in Guangdong Province is still under unresolved request, and the special tax on leather products has followed suit. In Guangxi Province, products that are usually exempt from heavy taxation for imitating machine-made foreign styles, such as domestic electric fans, must also pay the so-called supplementary tax. Repeated legal disputes have not yet been resolved. Regarding industrial control, most of the larger-scale industries in Guangdong Province are state-owned, so Shanghai factories have little room to compete with similar products in Guangdong, such as cement. However, Guangdong Province on the one hand vigorously implements industrial control of provincial self-government, and on the other hand opposes the 'overall, systematic, and planned national industrial control.' Our Chamber has sent a letter to the province asking it to explain the reasons for its opposition, but we have not received a reply. During your trip today, you must openly discuss with officials and businessmen in the province to find ways to overcome these difficulties, so that Shanghai's commercial opportunities will be restored. In other words, this is originally the responsibility of our Chamber, but in recent years, relying solely on commercial requests in writing has been ineffective. We have no choice but to entrust you with this important task on the occasion of your southern tour. We hope that you will understand our sincere intentions."</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's reply It was decided that Cai Shengbai, the head of the inspection group, would give the reply, "Our group's trip to the south today, receiving the hospitality of your Chamber and the guidance of the chairman, is a great honor. The purpose of our trip is to open up domestic goods sales. Because the sales channels in Guangdong and Guangxi are very broad, we will investigate the local situation, to learn and use it as a reference for improvement. We will investigate domestic raw materials to promote their use and connect the emotions of the two places to jointly promote domestic goods. Where our capabilities are insufficient, we still need your Chamber's assistance and guidance." At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the second, the Chinese Industrial Federation will host a reception for the group. At the same time, the Citizens' Domestic Goods Association Sports Meeting will also host all members. At 7:00 PM, Yang Dezhao will also host a farewell banquet.</p>

<p>The Common People's New Village, organized by the Common People's Welfare Committee of this Municipal Government, held its opening ceremony at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Zhongshan Common People's New Village on Zhongshan Road. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, members of the Common People's Welfare Committee Yu Hongjun, Shen Junyi, and Jian Youwen, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign guests including Wang Xiaolai and Zhu Shaoping attended. Zhang Tingrong, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Section Chief Li Dachao, and directors and administrators of various villages were responsible for the reception. After the opening ceremony, the graduation certificate awarding ceremony for the first class of the Shanghai Common People's Welfare Association Service Personnel Training Class was held. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Four New Villages</p>
<p>The Common People's New Villages built by this Common People's Welfare Association include four locations:</p>
<p>Pushan Road Common People's Village.</p>
<p>Damuqiao Road Common People's Village.</p>
<p>Qimei Road Common People's Village.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Road Common People's Village.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony yesterday was held in the auditorium of the Zhongshan Road Common People's Village. The village is located on the left side of Zhongshan Road. At the entrance, there was a pine and cypress彩牌楼 arched gate decorated with colorful decorations, with a bamboo cloth banner hanging above reading "Opening Ceremony of the Common People's Village." Inside, a paved path led directly to the auditorium. The auditorium could accommodate over 500 people and was neatly arranged. In addition to small Party and national paper flags hanging alternately, there were potted flowers decorating the sides.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM sharp, Mayor Wu, the committee members, and the Chinese and Western guests entered the auditorium and took their seats. The residents of the village stood outside the auditorium. The Municipal Police Department band played music on the scene. A loudspeaker was placed in front of the rostrum so that the residents standing outside could hear the speeches of the dignitaries. After the customary rituals, Mayor Wu delivered the opening address. This was followed by speeches from Westerner Talonglian, consultant to the Common People's Village, and Hongming of the Chinese Buddhist Association. A representative of the villagers then gave a speech of thanks. The ceremony then proceeded to the presentation of graduation certificates to the graduates of the Service Personnel Training Class and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu delivered the opening address, saying, "Esteemed committee members, esteemed guests, today our association is holding the opening ceremony of the Pushan Road, Damuqiao Road, Qimei Road, and Zhongshan Road Common People's New Villages. I am very grateful for the presence of people from all walks of life in this city. At the same time, due to time and space constraints, I have been unable to guide everyone to visit each village one by one, and I must express my considerable apologies. However, the facilities and tasks undertaken by the four Common People's Villages are roughly the same. You can get an overall sense from looking at just one of them. I hope that everyone will provide more guidance after visiting this village. The primary task of our society's construction is the people's livelihood. And among the people's livelihood's necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, housing is the most urgent problem. In this city, shantytowns stand side by side, and factories are densely packed. The general poor citizens feel the pain of not being able to live in peace, and therefore cannot develop an interest in working happily. Our association was established to meet this need. We have painstakingly operated over the past year, adding four new Common People's Villages. The purpose is to solve the housing problem so that ordinary poor and working-class citizens will not suffer under the highly competitive conditions of urban life. However, there are a large number of common people who cannot live in peace and work happily. A mere four villages with only a few hundred houses are of limited capacity and can be said to be only a very small contribution from our association to society. It is certainly not enough to meet the needs of the common people. This is only the beginning of social undertakings. We feel the gravity of the mission we bear and see the depth and magnitude of the suffering endured by the common people. With regard to the smallest achievements of the past year, we can only increase our belief in serving society and move forward. Recently, our association has been planning to build a new labor village and is studying various other plans in order to gradually implement them. We hope to make a greater contribution to society, especially to the common people. There are passive and active aspects to social welfare work. For example, the rent regulations in our association's villages are very low, in order to reduce the burden on the common people. This belongs to the passive aspect. The residents of each village are mostly poor people, and in fact, they can represent the common people of this city. Their expectations of the government are very high. The above-mentioned passive work is only to give them a slight respite. In terms of welfare, it still depends on the efforts of active work. Therefore, the task of our association is to focus on improving the lives of the common people and providing them with all kinds of necessary training to make them good citizens. During the construction of the Common People's New Villages, our association spent hundreds of thousands of yuan. The purpose we hold is not only limited to passively reducing the burden on the common people, but also to actively engage in the construction of education, health, and social undertakings. If you examine the facilities of this village, you will know the general idea. Now, most of the residents of each village have moved in. Taking this village as an example, all 330 residential buildings have been fully occupied. This proves the urgent need of the common people for government assistance. At the same time, our association also feels the need to continue to strive to serve the common people. The young people working in each village have all received training from our association, and they all have a strong desire to serve society. We believe that under the leadership and guidance of our association, they will be able to understand their responsibilities and work hard on the positive work that the common people urgently need. Our goal is to achieve the ability of the residents of the new villages to live and work in peace in the future and to receive appropriate civic training so that they can exercise their four rights, and further unite to become a model citizens' group. Therefore, the facilities of the welfare undertakings of each village are completely based on Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. Although there are no achievements to speak of today, we have infinite hopes for the future of the villagers. However, social undertakings should be completed by the joint efforts of people from all walks of life. Relying solely on the strength of the government is unlikely to achieve much success. In the past year, our association has spent a great deal of money, but the development of the undertakings in each village and the measures for the welfare undertakings of the common people outside each village still require the expenditure of large amounts of funds. At a time when the government's finances are difficult, it is not easy to seek to benefit all the common people in this city. We hope that people from all walks of life will cooperate with the government and provide sympathetic assistance."</p>
<p>Advisor's Speech</p>
<p>Dalonglian, the Western advisor of the Zhongshan Road Common People's Village, then gave a speech, first expressing his honor at participating in the opening ceremony of the Common People's Village. He then said that there are many common people living in simple houses with poor environments in the suburbs of Shanghai, which affects their health and will affect the entire city of Shanghai. Fortunately, Mayor Wu advocated the Common People's New Village so that the common people can have well-equipped residences. He hopes that there will be greater success in the future.</p>
<p>Hongming's Speech</p>
<p>Hongming, the representative of the Chinese Buddhist Association, wearing a blue robe, went to the rostrum, put his hands together, and began his speech, briefly saying that Mayor Wu of this city, with his usual care for the common people, had painstakingly planned and today has finally completed it. The cleanliness of its layout, the abundance of air and light, and the conformity of its internal management to the new era will benefit the common people in the future. It is by no means a small achievement. I am honored to participate in this grand ceremony and see this great cause, and I dare to be sincere in praising and eulogizing Mayor Wu, wishing him boundless blessings and longevity.</p>
<p>Residents' Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Xu Jiazhi, the representative of the residents, gave a speech of thanks, briefly saying that, because of the difficulty of life, we were terrified about the problem of housing in Shanghai, where land is so expensive. Not only are the prices expensive, but the poor environment makes us feel pain everywhere in our lives. We rely on Mayor Wu and the committee members to care about the hardships of the common people, to think for us, and to build this Common People's Village. Its low price, the abundance of air and light, and the cleanliness of its layout are vastly different from the past. Our children can enjoy compulsory education, and patients can receive free medical care. The purchase of daily necessities is also cheaper than outside. Everything can give us material and spiritual comfort and pleasure. We are grateful for this great kindness and will never forget the virtuous administration of Mayor Wu and the committee members. There was also a resident representative who was nearly ten years old, named Huang Shenhua, who used his clever tone to give a brief speech of thanks, expressing his gratitude for Mayor Wu's virtuous administration.</p>
<p>Awarding Ceremony</p>
<p>The last was the awarding ceremony of the first class of graduates of the Service Personnel Training Class of the Common People's Welfare Association. First, Committee Member Jian Youwen gave a report, briefly saying that when this association was planning to build the Common People's Village, Mayor Wu intended to start a service personnel training class in order to ensure strict management. Therefore, he began recruiting students last year. All applicants were graduates of universities and secondary schools. After four and a half months of training, they had three months of internship. Each student was very interested in this matter and handled it very seriously. They will definitely benefit the common people in the future.</p>
<p>Graduates</p>
<p>After Committee Member Jian finished his report, Mayor Wu awarded the certificates. The recipients included Li Putian, Yan Guodong, Zai Chongde, Wang Zufufu (director), Yang Jianwen, Xu Guanren, Zheng Jiabi, and Hu Xiufang from Pushan Road Common People's Village; Liu Xiang, Lu Shiqi, Chao Ruisheng (director), Li Derong, Shu Wen, Chen Zhenying, and Zhang Xiuhe from Damuqiao Road Common People's Village; Shen Hua, Zhang Jilin, Li Caihua, Yang Fugen, Liu Boyuan, Li Xingnan (director), Zhang Xipi, Wu Xueyi, and Qu Tong from Qimei Road Common People's Village; and Hong Xiaonong (director), Liu Yaozhen, Zheng Guisheng, Lu Dingyi, Han Yongsheng, Wang Junshan, Zhou Xiang, Zhao Liansheng, Yan Zigang, Chen Yi, and Chen Silin from Zhongshan Road Common People's Village.</p>
<p>Room Arrangement</p>
<p>All the houses in the Zhongshan Road Common People's Village are south-facing bungalows, totaling 330 rooms. Every six rooms are a group, and every two groups are a row. The rooms are spacious and have the preparation for a small garden. In the middle is a wide cement avenue. The interiors have cement floors, and the width and depth are both more than one foot. There are also stairs to climb to the attic, where two tatami mats can be accommodated. In the back, there are two small rooms, one for storing boxes and luggage, and one for the kitchen. The air and light are sufficient.</p>
<p>Public Facilities</p>
<p>There are now more than 150 families who have moved into the Zhongshan Road New Village, so various undertakings have begun to be carried out. According to reports from the Central News Agency, the village already has a complete primary school, an adult supplementary school, and a women's supplementary school. All residents are enrolled in schools. There is also a clinic, a public tea garden, and a consumer cooperative, all of which have been opened. In addition, men's and women's showers and men's and women's toilets have been built, and the layout is very clean. In the center of the village, there is a sports field that occupies a fairly large area, providing residents with extracurricular activities. There are also plans to organize extracurricular entertainment for residents and engage in side jobs. There are still more than one hundred houses that have been rented out and will be moved in soon.

<h3 id="e110">Recruitment Bureau Staff: Screening Results Announced Yesterday; 55 Passed the Exam, 58 Publicly Dismissed <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since the state-run Recruitment Bureau held written examinations for all its staff on the 23rd of last month, the test papers and work performance reports were taken to Nanjing by Deputy Manager Lao Mian to request the Ministry of Transportation's approval regarding which staff should be dismissed and retained. Only yesterday morning did he return to Shanghai, and the list of dismissed staff was announced by the General Manager at 4 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lao Mian Returns from Beijing</p>
<p>The standard for determining dismissals remained the quality of writing in the examination as the criterion for retention or dismissal. Earlier, the Ministry sent a telegram to Cai Zengji, ordering him to go to Beijing to discuss this matter, but Cai, due to his busy schedule, sent Lao Mian instead. Therefore, the test papers and work performance reports of all staff were taken together. Deputy Manager Lao consulted with Acting Minister Yu in Beijing for several days before a decision was made. The standard for passing or failing was based on the scores of oral and written examinations. Lao Mian returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. The Bureau first paid the staff salaries for February in the morning. Because it was the end of the month, the dismissal list was decided and announced in the afternoon, and all department staff were ordered to remain at the Bureau to await the announcement.</p>
<p>Manager Convenes a Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and normally a day of rest in the afternoon. All staff were usually free to leave. Deputy Manager Tan specifically notified all section chiefs in advance not to leave and to remain at the Bureau. Around 3 PM, he would convene a meeting with the staff of each section to announce the list of those dismissed and retained and to discuss the redistribution of work for those who remained. It was not until 3:30 PM that the two Deputy Managers, Tan and Lao, summoned the staff to the Board of Directors to make the announcement, stating that the list of retained staff had been approved by the Ministry of Transportation, totaling 55 people (excluding the accounting section and technical personnel). They were ordered to redistribute their duties according to the list. This dismissal decision still emphasized the written examination, and those with better writing skills were retained. Their work performance was not considered. Many individuals with outstanding achievements were not selected. Only 55 staff members passed the examination. The number of dismissed staff already announced was 34 from the Business Department, 8 from the Shipping Department, 14 from the General Affairs Department, and 2 from the Treasury. The Accounting Department has not yet been announced. A total of 58 staff members were officially dismissed yesterday. In addition, 6 staff members from the Business Department voluntarily resigned and were also approved.</p>
<p>List of Retained Staff</p>
<p>The list of retained staff is as follows: Business Department (including the Warehouse Section and Joint Transport Section) originally had over 70 people, now only 35 remain, including Yun Zhi, Li Sixun, Chen Xuliang, Wang Heqing, He Quansheng, Tao Futang, Wu Delin, Jin Duo, Gao Hanruo, Dai Buzhou, Zhang Shousun, Chen Yuhua, Wang Shengliang, Tang Xie, Zou Lun, Xu Yulin, Xu Guoyuan, Qian Xiangchu, Fei Jiasheng, Lin Jiehou, Wang Yuhuai, Hong Yansheng, Yao Shushen, Lu Zhaoxun, Guo Jingsu, Shen Shaosheng, Ye Yuan, Wang Xianqi, He Yueming, and trainees Jiang Jiaxiang, Sheng Qiqiao, Zhang Shengrong, Zhu Zengxiang, Wu Renlin. Shipping Department retained Qian Mingshu, Li Rui, Gong Jinglun, Shen Jianbao, Ye Yanhong, Jiang Weishan, Li Weilan, Qin Zuyin, Li Wenhua, and interns Ye Shiyi and Tang Ying, who were not included in the examination. The Treasury retained Yu Tianjue and four others. The Accounting Department will be handled separately.</p>
<p>Severance Pay to be Collected Tomorrow</p>
<p>The 56 staff members dismissed from the three departments and the two staff members from the Treasury will receive three months of severance pay and four months of accumulated double salary (totaling six months' salary). This salary could not be paid out yesterday and has been scheduled for payment on Monday. However, because of the large number of dismissals in the Business Department, it is felt that there are too few people left to handle the work of signing and issuing bills of lading, recording books, and other tasks in the general office (only two of the original seventeen people remain). The heads of each section are requesting instructions from Tan Boying and Lao Mian on how to handle this situation.</p>

<p>British Royal Air Force Commander Smith, who led two airships from Singapore to Shanghai, originally planned to leave Shanghai yesterday morning to visit Japan. However, due to the coup in Japan, the trip to Japan was canceled and he will fly directly to Hong Kong within days before returning to Singapore. According to postal sources, Smith intends to carry a small number of ordinary letters and postcards from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Singapore on the return trip. Anyone wishing to send such mail via the airship to Hong Kong or Singapore must send it to the Shanghai Postal Administration by tomorrow (Monday), indicating on the mail that it should be delivered by the airship and paying the required postage. To express goodwill, the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng, specially commissioned a silver insert plaque to be presented to Smith. The plaque is made of silver, with an airship engraved on the upper part and a picture of the city center government building on the lower part, with a beautifully carved wooden base. Yao Xijiu of the China Aviation Association also presented Smith with a marble ball as a souvenir. The two airships will fly back via the original route next week, weather permitting.</p>

<p>The United Association of the First Special District City of this city previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for a strict investigation of counterfeit new subsidiary coins found on the market to protect the credit of the subsidiary coins. The association received an order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, which stated: "Your submission of February 17, 25th year, regarding the discovery of counterfeit subsidiary coins on the market and requesting a strict investigation, has been noted. The Ministry has confidentially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to order a strict investigation to arrest the counterfeit criminals and punish them to the full extent of the law. You are hereby notified. This approval is dated February 26, 25th year of the Republic of China, Minister Kong Xiangzhao."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Creditors Win Lawsuit After Closure of Hong Kong National Bank; Bank's Objection to Jurisdiction Rejected by Court; Ordered to Pay in Full Plus Late Interest <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the closure of the Hong Kong National Bank, creditors of the Shanghai branch have applied to the court for the bank's bankruptcy. However, the bank submitted an accounting statement proving that the amount owed by debtors was sufficient to cover the debts and more, and the court determined that bankruptcy was not appropriate. The creditors were very pleased and waited patiently for the return of their deposits. However, because the bank had been closed for a long time and was very secretive about the liquidation process, the creditor Zhang Yaorui and others, believing that abandoning the debt for so long was not a long-term solution, entrusted lawyer Liang Yaobing to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District District Court to recover the deposits. The court has now ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the Hong Kong National Bank to pay back the plaintiffs' deposits in full, plus late interest. The reasons for the court's judgment are excerpted as follows: "The defendant shall pay the plaintiffs Zhang Yaorui and others their deposits, plus interest until the date of execution, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant." The defendant and its legal representative stated that the court had no jurisdiction and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Their defense stated that the defendant was a branch of the Hong Kong National Savings Bank, which was registered with the British government in Hong Kong. Although the defendant was registered with the Chinese Ministry of Industry, it was still a British legal person and not subject to the jurisdiction of this court. Therefore, they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, presenting the registration certificate from the British Consulate General in Shanghai and the registration certificate from the Chinese Ministry of Industry as evidence. The court ruled that the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong National Savings Bank, the defendant in this case, was established with the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Industry on April 3, 20th year of the Republic of China and issued a registration certificate. By applying to the Chinese government for approval of its establishment, it indicated its willingness to enjoy the same rights and obligations as Chinese legal persons of the same type and to be subject to Chinese law. According to Article 12 of the Implementation Law of the General Principles of the Civil Code, this court should have jurisdiction over the defendant. Based on the above, the plaintiff's lawsuit is justified, and the judgment is made in accordance with Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law as stated in the main text."</p>

<p>According to Da Gong She, the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, in order to provide emergency relief for the flood disasters in Hubei, Shandong, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Henan, and Anhui provinces last August, borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and 28 other banks. At that time, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications agreed to lend 300,000 yuan, and the remaining 200,000 yuan was entrusted to the Shanghai Banking Association to borrow from its member banks. The 28 banks each contributed amounts ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan. In addition to the agreement signed by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, each of the other banks signed individual agreements for record-keeping. The interest rate was set at 7% per annum, but the repayment period was not specified. The Association promised to repay the loans as soon as possible from the disaster relief funds donated by various parties. By the end of last year, half of the loans had been repaid from the donations deposited into the Central Bank. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Association's finance group told a Da Gong She reporter that the 500,000 yuan emergency relief loan borrowed from the banks had been fully repaid by the end of February of this year, using the disaster relief funds collected. All agreements have been returned and canceled. Among them, 160,000 yuan was the amount obtained by the Association from the Ministry of Finance using the 24-year disaster relief public bonds allocated by the Disaster Relief Committee to the Association and then converted to cash at the Bank of China.</p>

<p>The General Association of Chinese Marine Engineers, regarding the case of a foreign officer on the Jianghai Customs Yunxing patrol ship shooting and killing fisherman Lou Ahe off the coast of Zhushan Island in Dinghai, specially submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Special Commissioner for Party Affairs of the Chinese Seamen's Party, requesting severe punishment according to law to uphold the value of human life and enforce the law. The original petition is excerpted below: "Petition regarding the Yunxing ship foreign officer's</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Killing of Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>Please swiftly punish according to law to appease public anger and prevent future troubles. It has been found that three foreign crew members of the Jianghai Customs Yunxing patrol ship opened fire on and killed fisherman Lou Ahe off the coast of Zhushan Island in Dinghai on January 13 of this year. The ministry is requested to make a decisive decision and not be misled by the Inspector General of Customs, and to promptly arrest the three criminals and send them to court for severe punishment according to law to uphold the value of human life and promote the rule of law. In addition, all foreign officers on patrol ships belonging to the Customs should be replaced with Chinese citizens as soon as possible. The intention of the Association is to maintain navigational rights and safeguard the national interest, not only to remove the bad elements from the good crops but also to eliminate the harmful objects from the good horses. The Ministry respects the national constitution and cares for the people.</p>
<p>Abuse of Power</p>
<p>The Ministry will not excuse or protect foreign officers who abuse their power and kill people at will and will not destroy the national law. However, more than a month has passed, and no approval has been received, nor has it been heard that the central government has taken any severe measures against the three criminals. The public is feeling anxious and uncertain. It is believed that those who kill and cause death are current criminal offenders, and even current officials should restrain themselves and accept defeat and be investigated according to law. Even if there are special reasons, they must await the court's investigation to determine right and wrong and demonstrate the impartiality of the government. Even in the Shanghai Public Concession, where imperialism is deeply rooted, the authorities were able to send the Western police officer who threw the Chinese beggar into the Huangpu River to the First Special Court, regardless of the outcome of the trial. This demonstrated the Concession authorities' adherence to the law and their refusal to condone evil or protect private interests, which is more than the directly subordinate</p>
<p>Inspector General of Customs</p>
<p>What kind of people are these three foreigners who killed civilians? And what of the Western police officer who threw the beggar into the Huangpu River? The seriousness of the cases is not necessarily less serious than this one. It is believed that protecting the people is stipulated in our new constitution, and indiscriminate killing is intolerable in a country ruled by law. The fact that the three foreigners committed murder is obvious and should not be concealed. Even if they are foreigners, there should be a way to punish them. If they are allowed to remain at large and continue to work because they have the Inspector General of Customs as their protector, the disruption of law and order comes from the Customs' patrol ships, and the suffering of the people is caused by the foreigners on the patrol ships. If the Customs turns a deaf ear and the Ministry is too busy to attend to this, the abuses will only increase, the arrogance of the foreigners will become more pronounced, and the lives of the Chinese people will become cheaper. This directly rewards foreigners for killing people and indirectly</p>
<p>Degrades China</p>
<p>The national prestige. If this continues, it is feared that our powerless and defenseless people will become lambs to be slaughtered by others. In the extreme, the entire nation will be devoured by these foreigners, and the people's livelihood and rights will have no place to attach themselves. The principles of our party will also be destroyed. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. The Association feels that the situation is dangerous and must continue to submit a petition to the Ministry, begging the Ministry to consider that the people are the foundation of the country, and a solid foundation makes the country peaceful. At this critical moment, it should face the situation squarely and listen to the voices of the people, dismiss the three criminals immediately, arrest them and send them to court for trial according to law, demonstrating the principle of adhering to the law and showing the government's emphasis on the people. And all foreign officers on patrol ships should be replaced with Chinese citizens as soon as possible in the spirit of eliminating harm to the fullest extent. The undersigned is filled with trepidation and awaits orders. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Finance Kong (the text submitted to the Office of the Special Commissioner for Party Affairs of the Seamen's Party is similar and omitted).</p>

<p>The weather in this city has been like midwinter for the past few days, an unusual phenomenon for springtime in recent years. The northwest wind has been howling all day long, piercing the skin, and even more so in the morning and evening. Pedestrians shiver, huffing and puffing. Moreover, there was another sudden snowfall the day before yesterday, leading to a proliferation of diseases, and throat ailments and colds are easily transmitted. At the same time, it is difficult for crops such as wheat, vegetables, and beans planted in the four rural areas to grow, so the market price of vegetables has been rising for several days. Unexpectedly, the cold was even more severe yesterday. At 5 AM, the sky was overcast, and water turned to ice. Ditches and water pipes were almost all frozen. Even indoors, it was impossible to stay warm without fur. It was not until around 9 AM that sunlight appeared, but it was still intermittent, and snowflakes were seen. Only at noon did the red sun appear in the sky, bringing a little warmth. However, after noon, the weather turned cold again. In the evening, the cold air was even more intense, like midwinter weather. According to the report from the local weather station, the lowest temperature yesterday was 26.1 degrees, and the highest was 36.5 degrees. Unless the southeast wind turns around, it will be difficult to ease the cold for a while. Therefore, the general rural population is worried, as the spring planting is difficult, and the vegetables that have already been planted have been damaged by the ice. Everyone is worried that if it does not warm up again, it will affect the harvest. What is even stranger is that thin ice even formed on the sea off the coast of Wusongkou outside Daji Mountain yesterday, and it only melted around 9 AM.</p>

<p>According to Shiye She, the quality of domestic cigarettes has been improving day by day in recent years, and they can compete with foreign goods. However, cigarette wrapping paper has never been domestically produced and has always been imported, resulting in alarming annual losses. In view of this, the Minfeng Paper Mill has devoted itself to research and manufacturing and has been successful. It will soon be available on the market. In addition to the Minfeng Factory, the China Factory at No. 695 Tiantong An Road, Zhabei, has also recently successfully developed cigarette paper and will be giving away samples starting today. It will be available for sale at the beginning of next month. The factory issued an announcement yesterday stating, "In view of the fact that all cigarette wrapping paper required by domestic cigarette companies across the country is imported, resulting in annual losses of over four million yuan, this factory purchased machinery and established a factory last year to research and manufacture it. It was successfully developed on January 1 of this year and is no less superior than imported products. This factory plans to open soon. From the standpoint of domestic goods, cigarette factories across the country will be happy to purchase this product. In addition to submitting the product for registration with the Ministry of Industry and filing with the Social Bureau, a public announcement is hereby made, hoping that purely domestic cigarette factories everywhere will come to request samples."</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Case of Clifford, General Manager of the American Asiatic Bank: Facts Clarified After Third Court Hearing, Yesterday Commenced Oral Arguments, Hearing Adjourned and Bail Continued <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The case of German national Clifford, the General Manager of the defunct American Asiatic Bank, accused of privately converting cash entrusted to the bank for safekeeping by depositors into notification deposits, thereby causing losses to the depositors, has been heard for the third time by the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, Qian Hongye, who summoned the defendant and a group of individuals, thoroughly investigating and clarifying the facts.</p>
<p>Facts Clarified, Arguments Commenced</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the lawyers for both sides were instructed to present oral arguments in the First Tribunal. First, the lawyers for the plaintiff, the Public Works Department, Liang Rubao and Bao Yi, one speaking in English and the other translating, presented the reasons why the defendant should be held liable. This lasted for over an hour. The gist of their argument was that the collapse of the American Asiatic Bank was like a puppet show. The compradore of the bank, Huang Yicai, and the head of the custody department, Zhu Yousong, were merely puppets, while the defendant Clifford was the mastermind pulling the strings behind the scenes. The play could be called "The Failure of the American Asiatic Bank." Examining the reasons for the failure, it was neither due to a market downturn nor did it involve other issues; it was purely due to the defendant's fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The American Asiatic Bank was not registered with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Partnership Nature, General Manager Responsible</p>
<p>It can only be recognized as a partnership, and the General Manager should bear full responsibility. He cannot shirk responsibility for all the actions of the bank by claiming ignorance. The points that the plaintiff needs to prove are: 1. The defendant was the General Manager; 2. There were illegal activities; 3. The American Asiatic Bank gained illegal benefits from these illegal activities. Now, all three points have been definitively proven. Furthermore, Yang Xiqing came to court and detailed the process of his contacting the compradore Huang Yicai to deposit 20,000 in cash for safekeeping. The testimonies of Huang Yicai and Zhu Yousong are also consistent with Yang's, disproving any claims that Yang, Huang, and Zhu are lying. Although the defendant and Huang were initially very close, since the case began, the defendant has attacked Huang in court. However, the defendant should have foreseen this type of crime by Huang. The testimony of Leventhal, who was presented by the defendant,</p>
<p>Leventhal Should be Held Liable for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Leventhal's talent and knowledge are indeed excellent. He was able to overdraw huge amounts of money from the bank unconditionally and invest it in speculative ventures. His character can be inferred from this. As someone in charge of safekeeping, how could he not have personally seen the 20,000 in cash and yet rashly sign the receipt? If he were to be held responsible, he could hardly escape the crime of embezzlement in his duties. Moreover, the bank's regulations stated that employees could not open overdraft accounts. He once pointed out Huang Yicai's illegal actions, but his own crime was actually greater than Huang's. Therefore, Leventhal's testimony is not credible.</p>
<p>Excessive Lending Does Not Comply with Bank Rules</p>
<p>The bank's regulations stipulate that lending should not exceed one-tenth of the capital. Its capital was 2.5 million, but the loan to Hexing Company alone reached 2.5 million, exhausting all the funds. There was also a loan of 1.16 million to Puyi Company, and other loans of several hundred thousand were not insignificant. The reason for the excessive lending was that Leventhal was the chairman of Hexing Company, and other debtors, such as Puyi, had close ties with him. Therefore, they no longer considered the harm to the bank itself.</p>
<p>Both Chinese and American Laws are Not Compliant</p>
<p>For example, Huang Yicai owed more than 100,000, and his collateral was the bank's stock. This is non-compliant under both Chinese and American laws. The bank not only allowed Leventhal to take whatever he wanted, but also allowed many of Leventhal's relatives to overdraw, treating the American Asiatic Bank as Leventhal's private property. The defendant also engaged in speculation. The reason why he did not owe money but had 27,000 deposited in the bank was that he benefited from the bank's economic turnover. With this backing, he was able to turn defeat into victory. Although his deposit was also lost when the bank failed, what he gained was enough to compensate for his losses. Since the case began, the defendant knew that he was in a disadvantageous position and tried to persuade Huang to reconcile with Yang, believing that returning the money to Yang would lead to the withdrawal of the lawsuit. Now there is an attached civil suit. If the defendant is judged to be responsible for repayment, the liquidation office can suffer less loss.</p>
<p>Hoff's Words are Not Without Bias</p>
<p>However, the testimony of the liquidator Hoff is not without bias, and his words whitewashed the defendant. This actually exceeded his authority and amounted to a breach of trust, which should be noted. After the bank collapsed, a depositor committed suicide. In his suicide note, he stated that all his life's savings had vanished, and he took his own life out of grief and indignation. This kind of tragic case of family ruin was caused by the bank. The defendant, as the General Manager, should indeed bear the blame and be brought to justice, etc.</p>
<p>Defendant Has Three Lawyers Defending Him</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyers then presented their defense. There were three lawyers defending him. First, lawyer Chen Tingrui stated that the police handling the case, from the investigation on the 17th to the arguments on the 17th, repeatedly used smoke bombs, creating a tense and thick atmosphere. After the collapse of the American Asiatic Bank, those who were affected and lost their families and those who died were indeed very unfortunate. However, the collapse of the bank is one thing, and whether the defendant committed a crime is another. One cannot hold the General Manager fully responsible simply because he was the General Manager of a collapsed bank.</p>
<p>Bank Failures are Common</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent years, bank failures have been common. It has never been heard of to blame the president of the bank alone. The Shanghai Municipal Council's punishment of Leventhal and Baron was because Leventhal and Baron had committed crimes. The defendant's position and the facts of the case are different from Leventhal and Baron. The police cannot use Leventhal and Baron as examples and draw analogies. To say that the defendant intended to have Huang Yicai reconcile with Yang Xiqing is to recognize that the defendant was acting out of fear of crime. This is merely speculation and is not credible. Now, regarding the facts of the case, that is, the cash safekeeping being changed to notification deposit, this is truly undisputed by both parties. What needs to be studied is only the question of whether the defendant should be held responsible for this matter. The police believe that the defendant, as the General Manager, must have known about the change in the name of the deposit.</p>
<p>Extensive Scope, Unavoidably Demanding</p>
<p>It must be known that the American Asiatic Bank had a very extensive scope, with nearly a hundred employees, and deposits and withdrawals of around 50 million every day. It is difficult for the defendant to personally handle every detail. If his subordinates have illegal behavior, it is unavoidable to demand that the chief executive be responsible. Moreover, the criminal law stipulates that there should be no implications. Although there was a law in ancient times that one person's crime would affect the entire family, this is not the case in modern times. If the police can prove with documentary evidence and witness testimony that the defendant did indeed participate in criminal behavior, then the defendant should bear the blame. However, none of the photos, books, notification deposit receipts, or the receipts held by Yang and Yi were signed by the defendant.</p>
<p>The Words of Huang and Zhu are Indeed Credible</p>
<p>As for the testimony of witnesses, apart from the facts stated by Yang Xiqing, Huang Yicai and Zhu Yousong are of the same ilk. Huang, as the compradore of the American Asiatic Bank, had his contract witnessed by Zhu, and Zhu owed Huang more than 5,000. The relationship between the two is certainly not ordinary. How could Zhu not be Huang's echo? Huang, having obtained illegal benefits, wants to shift the blame to the defendant. Therefore, such testimony is indeed credible. Huang often argued that he had to obey the General Manager's orders because of the contract stipulations. However, the contract stated that obedience was only for legal orders. Is privately changing the name of the deposit a legal act? Moreover, the accounts between the compradores on April 8th of last year have been investigated. The amount deposited on that day increased by 20,000. This should undoubtedly be the 20,000 in cash delivered by Yang Xiqing.</p>
<p>Changing the Name of the Deposit was Done in the Same Way</p>
<p>Later, when Huang saw that changing the name of Yang's deposit was going smoothly, he still instructed Zhu to do the same for Yi Xiede's safekeeping deposit. Although Zhu did not gain any benefit, as Huang's debtor, he naturally obeyed his orders. The liquidator Hoff had already truly seen through this, so his testimony in court was fair and did not favor the defendant at all. In short, since the defendant was not the perpetrator of illegal acts and the bank did not obtain illegal benefits, he should not bear any responsibility, etc. The time had reached noon, so Chief Judge Qian adjourned the hearing until next Monday and ordered that the defendant Clifford remain on bail.</p>

She currently lived at number 94 near Xiaoputuo Bridge, outside Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. She had a nephew named Zhu Er, who had no steady job and associated with hooligans. Unexpectedly, the afternoon before yesterday, Zhu Er suddenly came to her house with a man, claiming to visit his aunt. They then went into her room to talk. At the time, the neighbors did not pay much attention because they knew that Zhu Er was her nephew. Until yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, when the sun was high, the neighbors still did not see her get up. So they went into her bedroom to check and suddenly saw her lying on the bed, her face pale and blood foaming from her mouth. They touched her body and it was cold, she had been dead for a long time. Her nephew Zhu Er and the man who came with him were nowhere to be found. So they rushed to inform her husband's brother, Feng Zhilin, (who works as a gatekeeper in Jiuji Lumber Company in Nanshi) who, after seeing the situation, immediately reported it to the Dongjiadu Police Station, asking for justice. Chief Yi, after receiving the report, immediately sent police officers to investigate. They also found fresh blood flowing from her lower body. The bedding on the bed was stained with blood. The clothes chests in her room were also open, and the contents had been ransacked and scattered on the ground, clearly having been turned over by someone. There were no obvious wounds on her body, so the details of the case are quite bizarre. Because the case involved a human life, the chief immediately instructed the local headman to report to the Shanghai Local Court. The Chief Prosecutor immediately sent Prosecutor Li Zhulin to investigate. After examining the scene and determining that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning, he sent a large number of detectives to investigate the truth and arrest the murderer to bring him to justice.</p>

Later, he opened an electric light factory, a local goods store, and a coal business in Meixi. In the seventh year of the Republic, Zhao Juxiang adopted a four-year-old girl named Lianlan from Meixi as a maid. She was clever and beautiful, and is now eighteen years old. He doted on her as if she were his own daughter. Last winter, Zhao Juxiang sent a letter from Meixi instructing his wife to spend the winter there, entrusting all household affairs to Lianlan before leaving. Unexpectedly, Wu, a young man from Anhui (named Xinlong, nineteen years old), who was a partner in the Xiecangchang Coal Company next door and was studying at a school on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, was on vacation and returned to his hometown. He knew Zhao's son and would look at Lianlan whenever he visited the house. Seeing Lianlan's beautiful appearance, they fell in love at first sight and made a private vow to stay together forever, and he incited her to run away. On the morning of the eleventh day of the first lunar month, Lianlan stole 13,000 yuan in banknotes, 5,000 in silver dollars, and a large number of gold, pearl, and silk items worth over 10,000 yuan from the hidden cellar under his bed. Wu Xinlong and she then came to Shanghai and hid in house number 13, alley 166, Dongjiaxing Road, living as husband and wife. Their whereabouts were mysterious. Later, when Zhao and his wife returned home and discovered the matter, they reported it to the Criminal Investigation Team of the Wuxing Command. Yesterday afternoon at 8:30, Team Leader Zhu Liangwu and Deputy Team Leader Guo Zhiliang saw Wu Xinlong riding a free car on East Broadway Road and secretly informed the Huishan Police Station. Together with Chinese Detective Zhou Guisen and Detective Zhao Yongqing, they arrested him. Questioning him, they learned where Lianlan was living together, rushed to the address, and arrested her. They found three suitcases and two British gold pounds, a gold ring with an inscription, a gold pearl ring, banknotes worth ten yuan and forty cents, and sixteen copper coins on Wu. They also found a passbook from the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank with a balance of 120 yuan, a passbook from the Bank of China with a balance of 1,000 yuan, and a passbook from the China Industrial Bank with a balance of 500 yuan, as well as three pairs of gold bracelets, ten gold rings, 170 silver dollars, five gold earrings, seven gold hairpins, two gold ear picks, two gold head pins, one gold tongue scraper, one gold watch key, two gold diamond rings, two gold pearl inlaid rings, one gold ring, two gold necklaces, five gold chains, one gold chain with beads, one string of beads, one gemstone, and one platinum watch.

Recently, Zhou Ruidajun, a Ningbo merchant in this city, received a letter from the Medan Earth Company reporting that the Sultan has long admired China's vast land, abundant resources, developed culture, and peaceful people. He is eager to travel north for a visit to fulfill a lifelong wish. He has now decided to depart from the south in the warm spring months of March and April. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to visit the capital first, then travel to scenic spots in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. On his way back south, he will also inspect Fujian and Guangdong. It is reported that the overseas Chinese community in Shanghai is preparing to welcome him, and Mayor Wu will be asked to send someone to receive him and guide him in everything.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Venerable Tejsmānanda, a high-ranking monk from Latvia, Europe, and his disciple Ananda, came to China ten days ago to study Buddhism.

His disciple is 24 years old, fluent in ten languages, especially Sanskrit and Tibetan. They both specialize in Esoteric Buddhism and have studied in Tibet and Japan.

He also said that Buddhism was very prosperous in Latvia more than a thousand years ago, but it was destroyed by other religions, and the images and temples were gone. Now, after his best efforts, there is a gradual resurgence.</p>

<p>Since the land survey in Shanghai and Nanhui counties, there have been many areas in the fifth district of Pudong and at the junction of Shangnan that are isolated and intersecting with other counties, which have not yet been rectified. For a time, landowners were unable to register. Now, Xing Zhigang, the district chief of Chenxing, and Shen Shunan, the district chief of Zhoupu, met with Jin Yanze and Li Zhiping, the land bureau chiefs of Shangnan, and brought surveyors to conduct a survey in person. It is estimated that the survey will be completed in four or five days to facilitate registration for landowners. The two bureau chiefs of Shangnan will consult and, after the supplementary survey is completed, the intersecting boundaries will be demarcated on March 10 to benefit local administration.</p>

<p>There are more than 200 households in Hexiaojiao village in the Fahua district of western Shanghai, with a total population of more than 1,000 people. Most of them live in old-fashioned bungalows inherited from their ancestors. However, due to the Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of house tax, the farmers in the village were greatly alarmed. In May of last year, they requested that the decision be revoked, but the matter has not been resolved for a long time. Last month, the Finance Bureau suddenly ordered the police station to summon two farmers from the village to the station. As a result, four or five hundred farmers from the village gathered at the police station. Fortunately, the station chief's persuasion was effective. After the villagers returned to the village, they elected Wang Guangrun, Yang Xingchu, and two others as representatives. In addition to petitioning the municipal government, requesting that the Finance Bureau be instructed to exempt the village from house tax, the representatives are now carrying letters to various statutory organizations in the city, describing the current bankruptcy of rural areas and the difficult living conditions of the villagers, requesting that Mayor Wu be asked to consider the current situation and approve a postponement of the tax collection to maintain the livelihoods of the farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs Promissory Notes Should Have Stamps <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Buffalo Hide and Straw Goods Trade Association, instructing that promissory notes should have stamps. On the 27th of this month, we received your letter asking whether promissory notes can also be exempted from stamps, as checks are exempted according to the fourth provision of the revised Stamp Tax Law rate schedule. After investigation, only the words "checks are temporarily exempted" appear in the tax exemption provision in the fourth provision of the revised Stamp Tax Law rate schedule promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, the stamp exemption is naturally limited to checks. Other bills of exchange, banknotes, and promissory notes are not exempt. The promissory notes issued by your industry should be stamped with two cents each in accordance with the law to avoid investigation and penalties. This is very important.</p>

<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative, founded by financial celebrities such as Zhang Shouyong, has been around for several years and is the first and largest credit cooperative in China. However, it was established at a time when the market was in decline. Nevertheless, those who joined the cooperative were still... Over the years, all industries in Shanghai have been struggling to make ends meet. The cooperative, based on the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance, and with fixed investment regulations, has been able to cope with the situation comfortably. Now, based on its years of experience and adopting the opinions of its members, the executive director Qiu Hanping has formulated a plan, which has been carefully revised by the chairman of the board, Zhang Shouyong, and has been submitted to the executive committee for approval. For the convenience of office work, the office will be moved to the third floor of the Women's Bank Building at 480 Nanjing Road starting on March 1. Now, details of the cooperative's recent situation are explored and described below, which should also be welcome to those who care about cooperative business.</p>
<p>Re-Registration The cooperative was established at a time when there was no Cooperative Law. Now the cooperative has been revised in accordance with the new law, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has issued a license numbered Xin Zi No. 1. The registered name is Shanghai China Economic Credit Insurance Limited Liability Cooperative.</p>
<p>Registered Business The cooperative, in accordance with Articles 3, Section 1, Clauses 4 and 5 of the Cooperative Law, operates (A) deposits and savings, (B) loans and discounts, (C) insurance for members' businesses, life, and disasters, and (D) mutual assistance businesses for members. All have been stated in the articles of association and approved for registration by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Revised Measures Many members of the cooperative have complained that the previous methods of paying contributions in installments from the savings and life insurance fund were too long and cumbersome and have requested revisions. Now the cooperative has revised the contribution and guarantee procedures. Anyone who joins the cooperative and pays 35 yuan per month until December will have 1,000 yuan paid by the cooperative in one lump sum to the Bank of Communications for a 15-year term. The cooperative will also issue a life insurance payment order for 400 yuan. If a member dies prematurely, the payment will be made immediately. This method was pioneered by the cooperative, so that members and their families can benefit. If there is an urgent need in the middle, the order can be used as collateral for a loan without the need for a guarantor, which is very convenient.</p>

<p>— Hu Yizang</p>
<p>Since the two major financial groups joined forces, silver prices unexpectedly fell, leading to inflation. At the same time, various countries were investing heavily in China. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they actively engaged in real estate, finance, and property development. Public utilities such as gas and water could even generate a net profit of more than 20%, propelling them to become the magnates they are today, wielding immense power.</p>
<p>Currently, Arnold serves as the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement, controlling the pivotal aspects of Shanghai's municipal administration. Victor Sassoon, the leader of the Sassoon financial group, advocated for a "Shanghai Pound System" last year as a countermeasure against China's currency instability. He is a British gentleman of Jewish descent, now in his sixties, and possesses remarkable insight into global affairs. Under the direct or indirect control of these two major financial groups, there are over twenty companies involved in banking, construction, trust, investment, gas, trade, maritime and land transportation, insurance, and other sectors. In particular, among the land and buildings, the so-called Sassoon House (the Cathay Hotel, Shanghai's only Hua Mao Hotel) and Hamilton House are both buildings owned by this financial group. Although the capital of the Sassoon Banking Corporation is only one million pounds, it also influences the major trends in Shanghai's exchange and gold markets. It is estimated that the total investment of these two financial groups in Shanghai is around 150 to 160 million yuan. Since the rise of the movement for the restoration of national rights in China, the custody of tariff revenue was transferred from HSBC to the Central Bank due to tariff autonomy. Recently, due to the global economic downturn, drastic fluctuations in silver prices, the decline in the purchasing power of the Chinese people in the interior, and the overall expansion and leap of Japan's political economy, the economic power of the British has been significantly threatened. In other words, Japan's political and economic activity and Britain's China policy are fundamentally in conflict. For example, in Manchuria and Shanghai, Manchuria has gained the support of Japan and will extend from North China to South China. Shanghai is under pressure from Japanese forces. As a result, the original British power is gradually declining. Judging from the recent trade situation between Japan and Britain, Japan has surpassed Britain. The expansion of Japanese power can be clearly understood by comparing the trade between Shanghai and Japan and Britain in the past year and the year before. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Basketball Training by Dong Shouyi</p>
<p>Starting April 1st at Tsinghua</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Mr. Shen Ciliang, the general secretary of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, is scheduled to travel north from Shanghai to Beiping in early April to inspect the training of national basketball players. The number of representatives for the World Games track and field competition is twelve, and the position of coach is held by Ma John. The letter of appointment from the Athletic Federation was sent to Ping City yesterday. Ma is currently aware that track and field is in a period of development in our country, and because various places have requested an increase in the number of representatives, Ma recently sent a letter to the executive board of the National Athletic Federation, requesting a further increase in the number of people in order to promote it. He will also accompany the delegation to Germany to investigate the subsidy methods for sports service personnel. Ma has already drafted and sent to Shanghai a plan to subsidize each person with approximately 700 to 800 yuan. The entire plan will be announced after it is approved by the executive board of the Athletic Federation. Furthermore, the training location for the basketball representatives will be at Peking University and Tsinghua University, which have been formally borrowed by the National Athletic Federation, starting on April 1st. Training will last for one or two months. The National Athletic Federation's notices to the team members have also been sent to Ping City yesterday. As for the position of professor, the Athletic Federation has also hired Dong Shouyi, and the letter of appointment has also been sent.</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The basketball representatives participating in the World Games will gather at Tsinghua University in Ping City on April 1st for training. The training period will depend on whether the delegation will travel abroad to places such as Nanyang before the Games. If they travel abroad, the training will last one month; otherwise, it will be a longer training period of two months. At that time, all the athletes will have to stay at Tsinghua University to concentrate on training. It is said that Nanjing athletes Wang Yuzeng and Wang Shixuan will arrive in Tianjin on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month and will stay at the Provincial Stadium. As for the five athletes from this city, Wang Hongbin, Li Shaotang, Shen Yugong, Xu Zhaoxiong, and Liu Baocheng, they are scheduled to go to Ping City at the end of March. Shanghai athletes such as Wang Nanzhen will also arrive in Ping City at the end of March. According to a local sports figure, the atmosphere of basketball in Tianjin has been unusually dull recently. Because the World Games athletes will go north next month for training, in order to adjust the atmosphere, Wang Yuzeng and other athletes from Beiping will come to Tianjin for friendly matches, such as the national team against the Tianjin China team, or the national players will be divided into two mixed teams for exhibition matches. At that time, Tianjin fans will be able to feast their eyes.</p>

<p>Among them, the match between Insurance and Derong was the most important. Because Insurance has been victorious in all directions, and Derong is not a weak team, the battle was quite exciting. In the first half, there was a back-and-forth exchange, and there were many dangerous situations, but both sides were able to preserve their integrity. In the second half, the god of Derong did not bless them, and the central defenders lost their footing one after another. The Insurance left forward kicked in one goal. Subsequently, Insurance also had a corner kick opportunity, and the Derong soldiers accidentally kicked it into their own goal. In the middle battle, the Insurance center forward kicked in another goal, resulting in a score of 3-0. Insurance won and won the championship of the Rules group. In the Rules group, the strength of the Weak Friends team is the strongest. Although they lost to the Postal Workers once, the Postal Workers gave up the game twice and were disqualified from the competition. Therefore, the North Friends are still in perfect condition. Unfortunately, the team's spirit was not good, and they gave up the game against Insurance, losing this good opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Personnel Engaged in Compulsory Literacy Education <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Filed with the Ministry of Education for Approval</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request to formulate and promulgate regulations for promoting compulsory literacy education in the province, and requested that they be filed with the Ministry. The Provincial Government believes that the lack of universal literacy education is a major obstacle to the implementation of government policies and a hidden worry for the nation. It is determined to achieve practical results, but at this time of frequent disasters and difficulties for both the public and private sectors, there is a lack of adequate special funds and facilities. Therefore, it relies on the efforts of officials and people throughout the province to raise funds. Fortunately, the Baojia system has been used to establish a preliminary framework. By promoting it in this way, it will be of great benefit to eliminating illiteracy in the province. The Provincial Government previously stipulated that those counties that complete the initial literacy education work on schedule would be included as one of the performance evaluations of the county heads and directors, and ordered that this be implemented. Now, in order to facilitate assessment, in accordance with Article 17 of the Provincial Government's previous "Preliminary Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties," the "Jiangsu Provincial Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Personnel Engaged in Compulsory Literacy Education in Various Counties" has been formulated to promote progress. Please consider filing them for record, which is very convenient, etc. The reply stated that the formulated regulations on rewards and punishments have been reviewed and are in compliance, and should be filed for record as requested. The 16 articles of the regulations on rewards and punishments for personnel engaged in compulsory literacy education in various counties formulated by the province stipulate that county heads, directors of education bureaus, directors of public security bureaus, district chiefs, township chiefs, Bao chiefs, personnel in charge of public security affairs, heads of social education institutions, and school principals who are able to complete the preliminary plan in the 25th year of the Republic, raise funds effectively, be able to economize on expenditures, work diligently, and effectively supervise the attendance rate of enrolled people in the county to average 85% or more per month, and the graduation rate of students in the county to be 85% or more of enrolled people will be rewarded separately. Those who fail to hold the event without reason, perform poorly, achieve no results, or whose attendance rate of enrolled people averages 40% or less per month, and whose graduation rate of students in the county is 40% or less will be punished separately.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Xiangya Medical College Has Already Improved According to Orders <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Hunan Xiangya Medical College, previously received instructions from the Ministry of Education to diligently implement and report on improvements based on the key points of the inspection report. "According to the key points provided, the improvement report includes: ㈠ The annual budget of the college consists of three items: subsidies from the Hunan Provincial Government, subsidies from the American Yale-China Association, and income from the hospital. Equipment expenses are subsidized by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees and the Ministry. The total annual income is more than 200,000 yuan, but the subsidies from the provincial government are heavily in arrears, causing some difficulties. The school medical committee has been asked to plan a fund to handle this effectively. ㈡ 'Adding teaching staff to the basic faculty': Starting this academic year, new teachers have been added, such as Dr. Bai Shien from Peking Union Medical College for bacteriology, Lao Qixiang for mathematics, He Jiasheng for physical education, Chen Renlie for physics, and Ling Xiaoying for embryology. Each department has dedicated personnel responsible for teaching. ㈢ 'Increased equipment': The main instruments for each laboratory have been added, including a magic lantern, 36 microscopes, a generator, and over a hundred types of books and magazines. Others are being purchased and will soon arrive in Hunan. A library has also been established, accommodating over a hundred people for reading. ㈣ 'Improved teaching': The college has been teaching in English since the eighteenth year. Since its opening, the college has advocated using Mandarin Chinese, but due to difficulties such as the lack of standardized terminology and suitable Mandarin medical textbooks, it has not been fully implemented. Currently, Mandarin is mostly used for teaching in lower grades to reduce students' difficulties, while upper grades should be given the convenience of reading Western reference books, so English must be used. Senior students can fully understand English. In the future, when the terminology is finalized and more domestic medical books are published, Mandarin Chinese can be used for all teaching." The above four items truthfully state the situation and are submitted for review and approval. The Ministry of Education has instructed that the reported improvements are generally acceptable and should be implemented diligently.</p>

<p>And Host Reporters from Local Newspapers</p>
<p>To Report on the Invention Process and Scope of Application</p>
<p>Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, Dean of the School of Education at Great China University, previously felt that the Western-style school education was not suitable for China today. He spent three years inventing the Popular Education Vehicle. The Ministry of Education reviewed it and deemed it a useful tool for promoting popular education, ordering it to be adopted nationwide. Mr. Tai has scheduled a public demonstration for the Shanghai press community on March 10th to explore the invention process and scope of application, etc. as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e188">Invention Process <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>In the autumn of 1933, Mr. Tai felt that the Western-style school education system was not suitable for China's needs today. Based on his research findings, he created a Popular Education Vehicle. Its form is a rectangular wooden box with very simple contents. After more than a dozen improvements, it was tested in the Shanghai Civil Education Experimental Zone jointly established by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Great China University, and the Popular Education Movement Promotion Association for as long as two years before it was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Structure and Content <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Popular Education Vehicle has the appearance of a square wooden box with three wheels at the bottom. The painted boards on the front and back of the vehicle can be used as blackboards or transformed into long tables for various activities such as displaying exhibitions and playing table tennis. There is an iron frame on top, which is usually placed inside the vehicle and taken out when needed to build a shed for hanging blackboards, charts, oil lamps, paintings, abacuses, etc. A cloth curtain can also be stretched on top. The vehicle frame and edges have rulers for measuring height and cloth. The vehicle contains five sets of movable popular education items. The box shells can be opened to serve as blackboards. The box is divided into storage for hygiene, teaching, entertainment, crafts, and agricultural exhibition supplies, which can be taken as needed. The box can be carried on the back over mountains and waters, reaching far and wide. The vehicle also has four folding educational stools, which take up very little space and can provide seating for eight people when unfolded. They are sturdy and safe from tipping.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Scope of Application <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The application of the Popular Education Vehicle is extensive, roughly including the following: ㈠ County education bureaus and education sections can purchase the vehicle to promote free education, especially the mobile education stipulated in the outline of free education implementation measures, which cannot be promoted without using the vehicle. ㈡ Local mass education centers, farmer education centers, libraries, etc. can use the vehicle to create mobile education centers or mobile libraries to promote mass education outside the centers. ㈢ Local people's schools can purchase the vehicle to create mobile people's schools to increase the efficiency of people's education. ㈣ Local primary and secondary schools can use the vehicle for public education and people's education to train students' ability to serve the community. ㈤ Local education departments should use the vehicle as the central hub to guide and assist in the popularization of education. ㈥ University education departments, normal colleges, local normal schools, and normal departments of middle schools should offer "mobile education" courses using the vehicle for students. ㈦ Other educational organizations and groups should use the vehicle to assist in free education.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Public Demonstration <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The vehicle has twelve functions: mobile library, traveling teaching platform, mass newspaper, mobile exhibition, alternative venue, civilian desk, temporary hospital, cooperative store, simple factory, agricultural guidance, entertainment venue, and open-air tea garden. One person can manage this vehicle and travel around the countryside. Mr. Tai has scheduled a reception for the local press community at 6:30 PM on March 2nd at the Yizhi Xiang Vegetarian Restaurant on Simalu and will give a public demonstration.</p>

<p>Chapter X Gratitude</p>
<p>This annual Thanksgiving Day at Plumfield was celebrated in the old good way, without interruption. For several days before, the little girls had been assisting Aunt Jo and Mrs. Bhaer in the pantry and kitchen making various pastries, selecting fruit pulp, and scrubbing dishes, all of which were very busy and self-important. The boys lingered on the border of that forbidden land, smelling the fragrant smells, peering into those secret workshops, or tasting a little of the delicacies still in the making.</p>
<p>This year there seemed to be something going on that was not in previous years, because the children were rattling up and down the stairs, and the boys were also busy in the classroom and warehouse. They were dumping baskets and boxes, searching for old ribbons and lace and other delicate fabrics, and a large number of grass blades, cotton, flannel, as well as large black beads, for Frau Bhaer and Mrs. Jo. Nat was busily working away at those strange machines in the factory, and Little Jo and Tommy each kept muttering to themselves as if trying to memorize something, sometimes audible with a terrifying sound emitted by Emil. And sometimes when Mrs. Bhaer et al wanted Rob and Teddy to go, they were not seen for several hours, we heard bursts of laughter from the nursery. But what puzzled Mr. Bhaer most was where Rob's big pumpkin had gone. It was indeed happily sent into the kitchen, and soon appeared a dozen butterscotch pie. But this does not eliminate a quarter of the giant melon, where is the rest? It was always a mystery, Rob seems not care, laughing when someone talked about it, asked his father to "wait and see", because the whole thing was to surprise Uncle Bhaer in the end, do not let him know a little bit in advance.</p>

Thereafter, banks did business with each other, and the overall trend was peaceful. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged, and it also lacked much impact.

<h3 id="e199">Securities: Unified B and D Bonds Rise More Than Two Yuan, 96 Speculation Resurges with Frenzied Rallying <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The market prices on the Chinese Securities Exchange yesterday mostly trended higher in each session. It is difficult to prove whether there was leveling of the market price in the middle. The difference in the amount of increase is still inconsistent, because the background of each public bond and the amount of various old bonds contained in it are obviously different. For example, Unified C bonds contain as many as six types of old bonds, so most of the sellers have ready inventory. The price increase will naturally not be covered, so the market price increase is 7 or 8 jiao different from the B and D bonds before and after. As for 96 public bonds, the Northern group is again spreading rumors, saying that there may be hope of reorganization after the establishment of the Organizing Bond Committee. This kind of neurotic thinking is said to be deliberately mystifying in order to speculate. It can be said that the means are naive. Recently, when the government reorganized various old bonds, it had already stated in connection that the 96 fund was not available. At this time, if there is surplus to reorganize 96, then the use of unified public bonds to reorganize various old bonds is already redundant. With a little thought, the rumors will surely be self-defeating. In yesterday's process, the market price increased in each session, mostly bought in numbers 4, 16, 35, 37, and 78, and sold in numbers 5, 48, 54, and 78. The market price was raised by several jiao to 2.4 yuan, restoring the initial opening market price of the previous day. The 96 public bonds have risen by more than 3 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The total number of transactions yesterday was 10,094,000 yuan, with 96 accounting for 3,485,000 yuan, accounting for one-third of the total. The result of the rise and fall is compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e200">New York Stock Market Panic at Its Peak <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Hsin Feng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 28th), the New York stock market declined. This was due to President Roosevelt's proposal for a slight tax and the Interstate Commerce Commission's announcement of railway freight rate reductions. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. only issued a dividend of $0.20 per share, while the public expected $1.00. The market initially seemed stable, but later, a wave of selling suddenly intensified, causing prices to weaken. As a result, copper stocks slightly softened, oil stocks were mixed, utility stocks fell by a few points, and steel stocks strongly resisted the decline. However, they gradually succumbed at the end. It is predicted that steel mills' work in March could reach 60% to 70%. Railway materials and some special investments were strong, but railways tended to decline due to the mandated freight rate reductions and reduced freight volume. Small exchange stocks experienced a sudden selling spree at the end, resulting in mixed outcomes. In the bond market, both U.S. government bonds and corporate bonds were firm. The total daily trading volume was 2.46 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the bullish sentiment is intensifying. There were rumors circulating in the market early this morning, with a strong bullish atmosphere.

At the same time, spot yarn sales were notably active, causing the market to advance steadily. In the afternoon, profit-taking by bullish investors caused a slight decline, it is said.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Up Over Two Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session for marked yarn, prices for all months jumped and opened high. Due to the stability of marked gold, it was said in the market that deposits held in foreign banks would be repatriated and deposited in the National Bank, causing much discussion. All kinds of rumors were bullish. Yuen Yi, Chang Feng, Da Chang Cheng, and gold firms all bought in, leading to an increasingly excited market, with bullish sentiment strong and prices rising steadily. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2.2 to 2.39 yuan (5, 6, 7) compared to the closing price of the previous day. The three months all broke through the 200-yuan mark. The market remained tight at the opening in the afternoon. Spot yarn business from inland areas, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other regions was particularly strong.

<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, but the situation remained firm. Rumors suddenly flourished in the market, creating a bullish atmosphere, and ordinary non-industry investors scrambled to buy in, causing prices to advance steadily. In the afternoon, the market became loose due to selling by Japanese firms, it is said.</p>
<p>Da Chang Cheng Absorbs Marked Cotton</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session for marked cotton, prices continued to rise, with a good situation. American cotton was stable, rising 2 to 6 points, and Indian cotton rose 1.75 to 2 rupees. The Osaka Sampin cotton market remained closed. Rumors abounded in the market, and buyers were active. Da Chang Cheng bought heavily, and gold merchants also came to absorb cotton, causing the market to jump sideways. As a result, prices for all months rose by 4, 5, and 6 points compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market turned flat at the opening in the afternoon. Japanese firms were selling, and Tong Cheng bullish investors were also releasing positions, causing the market to loosen. The market sentiment turned downwards.

<h3 id="e204">Sharp Rise in American and Indian Cotton Prices <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, the situation was calm, with prices for all months fluctuating by 2 to 3 points. Later, local firms and traders bought in, causing prices to move upwards steadily. There were not many non-industry buyers. The passage of the Farm Bill did not seem to have an impact on the market. Traders were still waiting for future developments. Finally, the government sold March futures at $0.1125, and the closing was stable. Spot prices rose 6 points, and futures rose 1 to 6 points. Hester's estimated this week's mill consumption at 265,000 bales and Liverpool's inventory at 399,000 bales. British cotton spot prices rose one point, and futures fell one point. Indian cotton was firm as short positions were covered during the price decline, and later due to buying by retail investors. Pingle rose 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, Ormla rose 2 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 28th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Creek cotton on the 29th is 189 rupees, down 1.25 rupees from the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>(Ke-Hsien) The supply continues to be scarce. More than a thousand packages arrived from Jiangxi, but due to high costs, they were unwilling to sell at market prices. The local price of Jiangxi rice milling machines has already reached more than eleven yuan. Yesterday, the market absorbed Ke-Hsien rice well. Quanzhou merchants actively purchased more than a thousand packages of early and late milling machines from Jiangxi. Inland merchants, such as those from Pinghu, also purchased several hundred packages.囤户 responded modestly, but the market in the local towns and villages has become more active. The market sentiment was extremely strong throughout the day, and prices increased sharply by one or two points. Early Jiangxi milling machines were the most popular, with prices reaching ten yuan, two or three points higher than the previous market. All other rice prices followed suit. The market is still looking good. It is reported that 4,500 packages of Gan rice, 1,188 packages of Xiang Sha Han rice, 1,200 packages of Wen Tai rice, 200 packages of Jiangbei rice, and 200 packages of Guangdong red rice were sold.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Local merchants continue to inquire about spot goods. The cargo owners are holding firm. The market only traded 150 packages of Saigon No. 1, with prices increasing by one point and reportedly reaching ten yuan. Although other transactions did not occur, market prices are generally looking good. Siamese rice futures continue to be welcomed by merchants and囤户. Yesterday, 1,300 tons were purchased by Xinfeng, Qianfeng, Xie Daheng, and others, at the original price of four yuan and nine points, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e206">River Rice Sales Still Not Bad <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the supply from various firms remained scarce, with only about twenty firms arriving (a total of more than 4,000 stones of goods). Although the local market was slow, and firms such as Qingniao only purchased 1,400 to 1,500 packages, the market situation still looked promising. The price of thick early粳 rice increased by five points, while the price of thin稻 increased by several points. Dujian was also good for five points, and the price of Yinyan Yuan was also firm.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the supply from various river areas remained scarce, with only seventeen or eighteen firms arriving. The local sales of white粳 continued to be active, and prices increased by nearly a point. The scattered sales of thin稻 have become more active, and prices have also increased by a point. The sales of Yangbu Jian were slow, while the sales of Dujian Bu Ke Jian were still not bad, and prices remained firm, increasing by several points to one point. The sales of Baiyuan were slightly active, with prices increasing by a point. Prices for all other goods showed an upward trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for February flour futures. There was no market for futures. The total number of deliveries was 80,000 packages, all from the套头 warehouse receipts of Fuxin factories. Since the difference between February and March was equal, arbitrageurs could not continue to arbitrage. Therefore, most of them were returned. It is estimated that local merchants took 12,000 packages, and the rest were taken back by the factories themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Spotty Deliveries of Miscellaneous Grains in February; Wheat Alone Had No Formal Deliveries <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>In the miscellaneous grains delivery, there was no formal delivery of wheat. However, there were fourteen tickets for standard sesame (25 tons per ticket), with the 16th and 36th warehouses each delivering two tickets, the 12th delivering three tickets, and the 26th delivering seven tickets, all of which were taken by the 24th warehouse. 1,400 dan of soybean oil were delivered, with the 12th and 33rd warehouses each delivering 300 dan, the 25th delivering 100 dan, and the 45th delivering 700 dan, all of which were taken by the 9th warehouse. A total of 37 cars of soybeans were delivered, with the 25th, 30th, and warehouses each delivering one car, the 26th delivering two cars, the 6th delivering three cars, the 38th delivering five cars, the 5th delivering six cars, and the 24th delivering eighteen cars. The 38th warehouse delivered five cars, the 5th warehouse delivered six cars, and the 24th warehouse delivered eighteen cars. The 6th and 9th warehouses each received two cars, the 30th received seven cars, the 25th received eight cars, and the 35th received eighteen cars.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat crops have not suffered any real damage, so alarming news is no longer effective, and the market has softened. Starting March 1, the operating hours of the Chicago Board of Trade for miscellaneous grains will be changed to Eastern Standard Time, from 9:30 AM to 1:15 PM.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market trend was flat and weak. The guild's marked prices were: 22.1 yuan for Group 24 sand white spot goods, 7.1 yuan for transit goods, 15.8 to 16.7 yuan for East Red sugar, and 21.8 yuan for No. 8 East White spot goods, 6.8 yuan for transit goods. No movement. 21.5 yuan for No. 9 YRO mark spot goods, 6.5 yuan for transit goods, both down by 5 points. Local factory cotton white continued to fall by two points. Zhenji No. 1 was 20.8 yuan, No. 2 was 6 points, No. 3 was 4 points, No. 4 was 2 points, and No. 5 was 20 yuan. Numbered盤 such as Chao Qing and Diao Qing were not opened due to a lack of demand. Hainan red sugar is scarce and lacks stock. The numbered goods are about to be sold out. Yesterday, over 250 packages were opened at 13 yuan, an increase of 5 points compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e210">North and South Goods: Limited Arrivals and Inventories of Orchid Bamboo Branches <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of orchid bamboo and lychee has been scarce, and the market is very tight. The market price was over 50 yuan. Only a dozen boxes have arrived this week. It is said that the cost has increased compared to before. Goods with large individual pieces, pure color, thick flesh, and small kernels are particularly scarce, so the number盤 have been raised.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Oil Market: Sesame Oil Sales are Very Slow <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Since the Bengbu goods were sold, the local market for sesame oil has gradually improved. Since this week, 800 cans of Nansuzhou goods have been traded, with prices opening at 20.06 yuan, still calculated at 100 catties per司码秤. These were scattered by local merchants. The market price is one point lower than Bengbu oil, mainly because sales are slow and prices are difficult to raise. Currently, the price in the production area is high, and the supply is scarce, but the inventory is still abundant, so the market situation remains flat.</p>

<p>Due to the influx of Moroccan 日 tea, Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang has been very sluggish recently. Chinese tea merchants have had to sell off at a loss. Among them, Zhenmei from She County Zhuang was sold by tea warehouses such as Gong Sheng and Yong Sheng Chang to firms such as Tong Fu and Xie He, totaling more than 200 boxes. The market price was 40 yuan, a further drop of 5 or 6 yuan. Other goods such as Zhenmei Gongxi are still not in demand.</p>

<p>Recently, Huisi iron of 200 sides has been sold to the United States by Japan for delivery in March and April, with a volume of 50,000 to 60,000 boxes. The factory cannot supply enough goods, so shipments to China have decreased. Local traders have heard this news and are scrambling to collect iron. The standard is rising sharply. The market price per box is 5 or 6 points to 1 yuan higher than before. Old steel factory goods are selling for 32.5 yuan per box, and new steel factory goods are selling for 32 yuan. It is estimated that 2,600 to 2,700 boxes were opened in the past two days.</p>

<p>Recently, Yuanqing直呢 has risen again, and the trend is quite good. Goods around five yuan and six yuan are particularly high, mainly because the cost of imports has risen, arrivals are lacking, and the inventories of internal and external warehouses are low. On the one hand, it is the peak season for spring sales, so demand has increased even more. Shoe firms, in view of recent economic difficulties in the market, and to reduce costs and cater to customer psychology, mostly do not use expensive goods, so sales of ordinary and lower-grade直贡 have increased. Currently, the momentum of Western and洋 imported goods, as well as Zhanghua Chinese goods and Dawu呢, is good. 559 has soared to 4.9 yuan, and Deki 1440 is 6.75 yuan.</p>

<p>18 pieces of San Nai were transported by the Hairui ship the day before yesterday. Samples were seen yesterday, and the goods are still good, but the body is relatively soft. However, due to the lack of inventory in the city, the asking price has risen by one yuan. The goods have been distributed to various firms, and there is an image of demand exceeding supply. It is said that Shantou's inventory is also low, and the market is still expected to be firm.</p>

<h3 id="e217">From Ming Dynasty Literature to the Public Security Jingling School <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Wei</p>
<p>From the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty to the early Hongzhi period, because it experienced a relatively long period of peace and stability, and the rural economy was stable, and the political system was on track, the literary style of the imperial court was at its peak, and the cabinet style of the Three Yangs represented this era. After the Hongzhi and Zhengde periods, the northwest was afflicted by bandits, and eunuchs monopolized the government. The era of peace was over. Generally people gradually became disgusted with the literary style of the imperial court. There was the retro movement of the former and later Seven Masters. The revivalists imitated the Qin and Han dynasties to make fake ancient texts, and talked about the great principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. This was because the situation had not yet reached an irreversible point, so they could still put on airs and talk nonsense. Later, as politics became worse and worse, and the rural economy was on the verge of bankruptcy, the literati were dissatisfied with the current political situation, and they could not think of a way to remedy it for a while. Simply, they did not put on airs in their articles, and did not talk about the great principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. Therefore, the Public Security School, which advocated "expressing one's spirit and not sticking to fixed patterns," and the Jingling School, which intentionally made articles difficult for people to understand, arose one after another. However, from the Tianqi period to the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the stimuli suffered by the literati were too deep, and many people opposed "independent spirit" and began to produce passionate and tragic works. After the Southern Capital, there were more poems about frost and chaos, and articles about millet and wheat, full of sadness and sorrow, which were completely different from those so-called "fresh, light, and graceful" or "dark, deep, and lonely." In the early Qing Dynasty, Zhang Dai (Zongzi), who claimed to be the culmination of the Public Security and Jingling schools, had a different content, structure, and style in his articles from the Public Security and Jingling schools. We only need to compare his works with the works of the Three Yuan and Zhong Tan, and we will know.</p>
<p>Looking at the evolution of literature in the Ming Dynasty, the Public Security Jingling schools were just a temporary reaction to the Revivalists. Their rise, growth, and decline were very short-lived, and their influence was not very great. Recently, the names of the Public Security Jingling schools have been mentioned more and more often, and the collections of poems and essays by the Three Yuan and Zhong Tan are popular in the market again. Literary historians also have to talk about the Public Security Jingling schools in detail when they talk about Ming Dynasty literature, so as not to be criticized. The fact that the Three Yuan and Zhong Tan suddenly got such good luck three hundred years later is really unexpected. However, in such an era and such a country, should this school of literature be promoted?</p>
<h3 id="e218">Choosing Children's Books <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhi</p>
<p>When choosing children's books, we need to set some standards. If there are no standards, "anything in the basket is food." Just giving children some reading material may not necessarily be good for them. It may be worse than not giving them anything at all.</p>
<p>First, the meaning must be proper. This does not mean that things like birds and animal stories cannot be read to them. Birds and animal stories are just a matter of form. What we need to pay special attention to is the content of the reading material. Whenever a piece of writing is written, whether good or bad, it must have the author's central content, which we call meaning. If the meaning is proper, then it is okay to read it even if it uses the form of bird and animal stories. Otherwise, it is not readable even if it is completely human language. Where do we distinguish between proper and improper? Just think: the readers are Chinese children, modern Chinese children, and what meets the needs of modern Chinese children is proper. Conversely, it is improper. For example: what is in accordance with the principles of physics is proper, and what contains superstitious ideas is abnormal. What promotes the spirit of collectivism is proper, and what promotes the legacy of feudalism is abnormal. —— By analogy, we can give many examples, so there is no need to elaborate here.</p>
<p>Second, the writing must be coherent. This standard is a bit strange. If it is written as children's reading material and printed on paper, can the writing still be incoherent? Ideally, there should be none. However, the children's reading materials that are currently popular, whether they are compiled or translated, often have unclear, disjointed, stiff, and difficult-to-read sentences. Generally, these problems are included in incoherence. Since there are indeed incoherent children's reading materials, we must pay attention when choosing them and exclude them. Children are cultivating their language habits while reading children's books. If this kind of incoherent writing is used as a model of language, it will make them unable to speak well, and gradually make them unable to turn a thought in an orderly manner. This influence is not slight.</p>
<p>Third, if it is poetry, it must be like poetry. Flattery and glibness are not poetry. Casual rhyme is not poetry. If there are pictures, they must be like a picture. What does not look like anything is certainly not a picture. If it looks like something but is stiff and lifeless, it cannot be considered a picture. Giving children things that do not look like anything is enough to inhibit their interest in that kind of thing, which is really a kind of abuse. Poetry and pictures are most loved by children, and are most helpful for children's enlightenment. Therefore, special attention must be paid when choosing, to reject those that do not look like anything and leave those that look like something.</p>
<h3 id="e219">"Twenty-Five Histories Supplement Compilation" General Rules <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>This compilation is limited to tables and treatises. All works of addition, annotation, textual research, and collation, whether they are the lost works of ancient sages or recent works of contemporary scholars, are included as far as knowledge extends. This is because learning values breadth and comprehensiveness, not narrow specialization; the duty lies in extensive collection, without shying away from promotion.</p>
<p>All tables and treatises with clear headings and distinct systems, whether published separately, in collections, or as appendices to books, such as the "Han Shu Yi Wen Zhi Kao Zheng" appended to "Yu Hai," the "Han Zhi Zhi Yi" appended to "Shui Jing Zhu Tu," and the "Liao Yi Wen Zhi" appended to "Liao Wen Cun," are all included. Those that are attached to complete works and difficult to separate, such as the works of Shen Qinhan, Zhou Shouchang, and Wang Xianqian on the "Han Shu," although they each have a table of contents, are actually part of a separate book and difficult to divide, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>The entire book is arranged according to the order of the dynastic histories, divided into sections. Each section begins with tables and then treatises, grouped by category. The recording of books also briefly explains the author's era to create order. Those that specifically describe the political systems and reforms of partial regimes and the activities of foreign tribes are placed at the end of each section to clarify the organization, such as Lian Shu's "Western Qin Hundred Officials Table" and Shen Weixian's "Two Han Xiongnu Table" and "Jin Dynasty Five Hu Table."</p>
<p>Since the arrangement of this compilation is based on the complete system of each dynastic history, the division of sections should be clear and not intertwined. Except for Xu Wenfan's "Eastern Jin Southern and Northern Dynasties Geography Table" and Qian Daxin's "Liao Jin Yuan History Leap Month Examination," which cannot be cut, we will allocate them according to their tendency. Other works, such as Wan Sitong's "Historical Tables of Past Dynasties" and Xie Zhongying's "Three Kingdoms Major Events Table," are all assigned to their respective categories without mixing them. The original catalog of the main source or earlier publication is recorded to preserve the original state. Brief explanations are added to indicate the reasons for changes.</p>
<p>Among the books collected, those that completely record the original text of the old histories but separately discuss or collate them, such as the "Du Shi Ji Shi Biao" with annotations, are treated like Xia Xie's "Jiao Han Shu Ba Biao," only including the summary and removing the old text. This is because the complete "Twenty-Five Histories" is already available, so there is no need to repeat it, which would only take up space.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this compilation, except for a small part of the manuscripts that are heavily marked and cannot be photocopied, the rest are intended to be reduced and printed using photographic zinc plates. However, upon careful examination of each book, some woodblock prints are blurred and unclear, such as Zhang Zongyuan's "Sui Shu Jing Ji Zhi Kao Zheng" and Lü Wutiaoyang's "Han Shu Di Li Zhi Xiang Shi"; some collations are not precise, and there are errors to be corrected, such as Bao's engraved "Wu Zhuoxin's Han Shu Di Li Zhi Bu Zhu" (the so-called excellent versions of Wang Yuansun, Qian Dian, and Quan Zuwang's Han Zhi also have occasional misprints); some have complex formats and small fonts that do not meet the compilation's reduction standards, such as the Guangya version of "Eastern Jin Southern and Northern Dynasties Geography Table"; some are originally letterpress or lithograph and cannot be reduced and reproduced, such as Gu San's "Bu Hou Han Shu Yi Wen Zhi" and Ding Xitian's "Hou Han Jun Guo Ling Zhang Kao Bu"; and some have paper that is too old and dark to be photographed. Since there are no other versions to replace them, we cannot allow the errors to persist, which would be regrettable, so we have decided to uniformly use typesetting. The original large characters are in size five, and the small characters are in size six. All are vertical, without interlinear notes. The typesetting is very clear, and the lines are uniform. Any obvious errors or omissions in the citations can be corrected at any time based on the original text.</p>
<p>Regarding the choice of versions: for those with many copies, the first edition is taken. If there are differences in the engraved versions or the number of volumes varies, the best or complete version is taken. For works supplemented by later scholars, which include the original authors' works when published, such as Xie Zhongying's work on Hong Liangji and Yang Shoujing's work on Wu Zeng, the later version is taken directly, still bearing the original author's name, so that the length is saved, and the origin is not obscured. If there are obvious differences between the published version and the manuscript, the two versions are collated without hesitation to reproduce them, such as Wan Sitong's "Southern Tang Generals and Ministers Chronological Table" and other six types.</p>
<p>Tables are used horizontally and diagonally, which is beneficial for clear latitude and longitude and easy communication. However, there are also those that have the same nature but different formats, those that have no fixed standards for dividing items, those that divide and transfer lines due to too many horizontal bars, which confuse the system, and those that fill in grids without any vertical or horizontal relationship. The spacing is wide, wasting paper. Therefore, for genealogical tables with horizontal and vertical relationships, such as Zhou Mingtai's "Three Kingdoms Genealogy Table," and official position tables and geography tables with division and combination relationships, such as Hong Yisun's "Three Kingdoms Zhi Official Position Table" and Wu Zeng's "Three Kingdoms Prefecture and County Table," the original format is still used. For other major events tables, official position tables, and generation tables mainly based on the inheritance of titles that have no vertical and horizontal division and combination relationships, they are all changed to vertical writing, following the example of Dun Xiong's "Hou Han Shu Chronological Table Collation and Supplement." For horizontal branching text, the traces of front and back connections must be noted to ensure that the system is not chaotic and the latitude and longitude are still very clear. Readers should understand this humble intention.</p>
<p>The main purpose of collation is to seek truth. If there are any uncertainties, comparisons must be made. For variant characters and divergent meanings, the best is chosen, and those that must be explained are also attached to the book as collation notes or postscripts to show caution. However, the knowledge and ability of colleagues are limited, and there must be many mistakes. How dare we try to embellish our work? We hope that knowledgeable people will not hesitate to teach us so that we can correct them during the printing process. It would be fortunate for scholarship and fortunate for our colleagues.</p>

<p>— Postscript to Ba Jin's Collection of Short Stories —</p>
<p>It has been several years since I started writing. I sometimes cannot figure out what I have written in these years. Thinking about it, some of my articles were discarded as soon as they were written, and some disappeared after they were published without my noticing. The few novels that have been circulated to this day.</p>
<p>The word "circulated" here makes me feel embarrassed. Just because they are "circulated" does not mean they are good things. Although today's fashionable bookstore owners can talk about "cultural standpoints" and print books in multiple editions, even four or five editions. So the fact that my books can be circulated to this day is not a glorious thing.</p>
<p>I am not satisfied with my own works. I cherish them sometimes, but I also hate them sometimes. And one thing remains constant: every time I read what I have written, I cannot help but pick up a pen and make random deletions and revisions. It seems that there are flaws everywhere, and I cannot feel comfortable unless I change them. According to a third-rate English critic, a good article cannot be deleted or revised at will. Not even a single word can be added or removed. From this, it can be seen that my articles are worthless.</p>
<p>Although that is what I say, I still do not have the courage to destroy my worthless articles, so I let them be printed in multiple editions in a muddled way. I do not want to make money, but I have never used culture as a front. My life is full of contradictions. For example, I am not satisfied with my own articles, but at the same time, I am unwilling to see those even more worthless books being sold to readers all the time. So I am happy to let my works compete with them for business.</p>
<p>I used to be busy writing articles. In the past year, I have invented (?) the word "laying down my pen" to perfunctorily deal with the great editors, so I have time to read. Sometimes I also read what I have written and spent some effort to organize my old works. As a result, I compiled two collections of short stories, including all of my short stories. I also attached a review of my writing life at the beginning, which is an old work, but with new material added. If readers cannot understand my novels, then the review of my writing life can help them. But if they still cannot understand after reading it, then they should simply not read it anymore or advise others not to read it. This is the most enjoyable way.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The second collection of Ba Jin's short stories is currently being printed and will soon be published by Kaiming Bookstore.</p>
<h3 id="e221">"Science" Magazine's Criticism of "Biographical Sketches of Biology" <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Although there are many publications in the book market in recent years, most of them are humorous essays or reprints of ancient books. In our opinion, in this era of famine for scientific knowledge, publications that benefit young students in general are in fact even leading ambitious young people to become passive or degenerate due to being drugged enough. On the other hand, many science books are also published by various bookstores, some of which are of course too specialized for the average person to understand; some are school textbooks that do not suit the taste of the average person. There are too few works that can both describe scientific facts and have literary meaning. The author of this book is known for writing science essays well. The book contains twenty-one biology essays, named "Biographical Sketches of Biology," which uses literary brushstrokes to describe scientific theories, so that readers can have literary appreciation and at the same time gain scientific knowledge, lightly sketched, from shallow to deep, full of interest. Sometimes, it quotes ancient poems, so that readers do not feel bored and can be nurtured by literature. Each article also has illustrations, which can increase scientific aesthetics. Young people who are generally bored can certainly regard it as a proper pastime, get considerable benefits, and increase a lot of common sense. From the perspective of popularizing scientific knowledge, this is also the best way to get started. From a scientific standpoint, what the reading community in our country needs now is not so much "humor" and "chat," but science works that are both literary and rational, which are pleasant and beneficial. We are extremely in favor of Mr. Jia's book being published and hope that it will greatly open up the atmosphere and renew the trend in the reading community. At the same time, we also hope that other scholars who are proficient in both literature and science in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and geography can make the same contributions in their spare time. The book's format, printing, and paper are all good. The actual price of four corners seems a little expensive. (Published in Science, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 152, 153)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Science" is edited by the China Science Society and has been published for twenty years. It is the most authoritative magazine in the domestic science community. It gives a good review to the book "Biographical Sketches of Biology" by Mr. Jia Zuzhang, published by this bookstore, and believes that it can "renew the trend in the reading community," which is enough to prove that the efforts of this bookstore in publishing have not been wasted, and we feel deeply honored. As for saying "I hope that other scholars who are proficient in both literature and science in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and geography can make the same contributions in their spare time," this bookstore has in fact already paid attention to this. There are already many books in the publications with the same nature as "Biographical Sketches of Biology," which are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e222">A Report on Soliciting Readers' Opinions on the Inaugural Issue of "New Youth" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>After the inaugural issue of "New Youth" was published, it was warmly welcomed by readers. The number of copies printed increased from 50,000 to 80,000, and from 80,000 to 100,000, but it was still not enough to distribute, which we had not expected at the beginning. We are naturally only redoubling our efforts to thank the 100,000 readers who love us for this extraordinary honor. However, we know that our abilities are weak and our knowledge is incomplete. There must still be many things that should be supplemented or improved in what we have contributed to "New Youth." Therefore, we published a brief announcement in the second issue of the "Reading Club" on January 16, stipulating two topics: (1) Reading the inaugural issue of "New Youth," and (2) What I hope from "New Youth," to solicit guidance and criticism from readers as a compass for future editing. As of February 10, we actually received fourteen solicited articles. Among them, eight articles were written using the first topic, and the content of each article was more about encouragement and less about guidance. Six articles were written using the second topic, and each article put forward several opinions and requirements.</p>
<p>Now, let's organize these articles, summarize them, and report them below:</p>
<p>1.  Hope to distribute the amount of "literature," "social science," and "natural science" evenly.</p>
<p>2.  Hope to publish more research methods for various disciplines.</p>
<p>3.  Hope to add more detailed analysis and research to the current situation.</p>
<p>4.  Instill the essentials of "national salvation and survival" and patriotic propositions.</p>
<p>5.  Hope to publish some texts about occupations.</p>
<p>6.  Publish more current affairs photos, cartoons, and illustrations.</p>
<p>7.  Pay attention to the needs of all teenagers (living in various different environments).</p>
<p>8.  Do your best to introduce or create the most valuable and cutting-edge knowledge in all disciplines.</p>
<p>9.  Focus on practical things as materials, and be willing to cut off irrelevant high-level discussions.</p>
<p>10. Pay attention to the popularization of texts.</p>
<p>11. Young texts should strive for novelty and interest.</p>
<p>12. Please set up a question and answer column for teenagers to answer all the difficult questions of readers.</p>
<p>13. Receive submissions and often solicit articles as much as possible to encourage and guide readers to write.</p>
<p>14. I hope that all of them will be typeset in size five, which can increase some pages.</p>
<p>15. It is best to change to weekly or semi-monthly, so that you do not meet after half a month.</p>
<p>16. Hope to have more experts in various disciplines write.</p>
<p>17. Hope to maintain the splendor of the inaugural issue and strive for excellence.</p>
<p>Here, let us divide the seventeen points indicated by readers into three categories to give readers a brief reply:</p>
<p>The first category is what we have already implemented, such as points (1), (3), (4), (6), (8), (9), (10), (11), (14), (16), and (17). Readers only need to look at issues 2, 3, and 4 of this magazine to understand. The second category is what we are planning, such as points (2), (5), (7), and (13). The third category is what we feel we cannot implement for a while, that is, only points (12) and (15). The inability to implement these two points is entirely a matter of manpower. (12) is the hope that we will set up a question and answer column. According to our past experience, we feel that once there is a question and answer column in the magazine, there will be a lot of letters asking questions. As a result, only one-tenth or two-tenths can be published; it is of course not possible to answer them one by one due to the number of pages and manpower, but we feel that it is a bit unreasonable to ask but not answer, which would cost readers a few cents for postage. (15) is the hope to change it to weekly or semi-monthly. This is also a matter of manpower, and the number of pages for weekly or semi-monthly publications cannot be too many, because if there are more pages, it will invisibly increase the burden on readers. If the number of pages is reduced, it is difficult to say whether it can still maintain its original appearance.</p>

<p>Since September of last year, this bookstore has launched the "Semi-Monthly New Books" and "Special Price 30% off" method, which has been six months now; there are a total of fifty books published. This method is convenient for readers, and we would like to know which books most readers like and what their feelings are after reading them. Please give us guidance and criticism in many ways as much as possible! We welcome submissions, whether long or short, and will publish them in this publication successively.

<h3 id="e224">What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yafang, Mingcheng Elementary School, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>"What kind of person will I be in the future?" This is indeed a very important question. In the past few days, I spent several days to answer it before I came up with a final answer. Although I am a female elementary school student, I don't have any ambitions or responsibilities now, but what about the future? I am always a member of the country, and I must at least be a good wife and mother to my family, and of course, I must do my best to my country; in this way, I cannot have no goals in life because I am young. Modern women cannot be compared with ancient women. In ancient times, being a good wife and mother was considered a lifetime of responsibility, as if it had nothing to do with the country and society. Now, in addition to the family, women also have to bear part of the duty of saving the country. Our China is so weak, although men should use all their energy to save the country, how can we women forget the work of saving the country? For example, once our country goes to war with the enemy, men go to the front line, and the rear work is the duty of us women. Sometimes the front line needs nurses for rescue, and we have to rush to the front line to serve. I often hear teachers say: "Women only work at home in peacetime, and they have to go to the front line like men in wartime." Ah! Should we be such a modern woman? I also think: a good wife and mother is not just about treating her husband and children well. We must make a family harmonious and able to work hard and be frugal, and create a happy family. Only then can individuals have happiness, and only when every family can do well can society and the country have hope. The above words are my goals in life in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Alarm Pillow <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>There are things in society that are used to warn people, such as alarm clocks and sirens. Now we have found another fact about alarm pillows from old books, and we are writing it down below:</p>
<p>Sima Wengong of the Song Dynasty was a famous Confucian scholar of the Zhu Dynasty. During his studies, he was deeply worried that his studies would not succeed. He usually lived in seclusion and studied hard. He specially made a round wooden pillow, with his head on it. If he moved a little, the pillow would roll. Even when he was in a deep sleep, he would be awakened. Therefore, he was called the alarm pillow. When he was tired of reading, he would fall asleep, but he would use a round pillow to warn him. After waking up, he would study again. He did this every day, reading tirelessly. Later, he became a great Confucian scholar. It was not easy for him to enjoy a great reputation in later generations!</p>
<p>Children all over the country! You are all mostly in the stage of studying now. During this most difficult period of the country, "reading does not forget to save the country, and saving the country does not forget to read," you must be moved by the facts of Sima Wengong's alarm pillow. I hope you will rise up with enthusiasm, study hard from now on, and cultivate useful talents so that you can contribute to the country in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Solidification and Melting <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Playing with snowballs is Min'er's favorite game in winter. So when it snows, he goes to school very early. But he hates the melting snow the most. The ground is difficult to walk, and the weather is very cold. He feels very strange, so he went home after school and asked his father:</p>
<p>"Dad, do you know why it is much colder when the snow melts than when it is snowing?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to know why it is cold when the snow melts? Then you must first know whether the weather is cold or not when the snow solidifies? I said that the snow is not much colder when it solidifies than when the snow melts, because when a liquid solidifies into a solid, it must release heat. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>So his father took a glass tube and a cup, put half of the water in the glass tube, and put some ice and salt in the cup. He put the glass tube in the middle of the ice and salt, and took a thermometer, first put it in the glass tube, and saw that the temperature of the water dropped to zero degrees, and the water gradually solidified into ice. His father opened his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"The temperature when the water solidifies stays at zero degrees and will not change until the water completely solidifies into ice. The temperature of the ice only begins to drop again. From this, it can be seen that the water will not drop to zero degrees when it solidifies, because it is releasing heat."</p>
<p>"As for melting, how can it be cold? When the snow melts, it must absorb heat to melt. You just need to take the cup you just took, put ice in it, heat it, and measure its temperature with a thermometer. The temperature of the snow, initially heated, reaches zero degrees and no longer rises until the snow completely melts into water, and the temperature of the water gradually rises. You can try it yourself."</p>
<p>"Dad, how much heat does it take for a solid to melt into a liquid?"</p>
<p>"This question is very complicated. Let me tell you a little bit. One gram of ice, when it melts into zero-degree water at zero degrees, must absorb 80 calories of heat. What is called a calorie? The heat required for one gram of water to increase one degree in temperature is used as a unit of heat measurement, which is called a calorie."</p>

<p>Monkey Show</p>
<p>In the open space, many children gathered in a circle, watching the monkey show. The monkey sometimes wears a golden crown, playing the role of an ancient emperor. Sometimes, he wears a command knife with a clanging sound, playing the role of a modern general; because he plays the show too seriously, he even forgets that he is a monkey. When he was playing the emperor, he saw a beautiful girl in the crowd, and he ran up to her, about to hug her, and shouted "My empress..." when the monkey player pulled the rope around his neck and pulled him back to the center of the field to continue the show, so he had to obediently follow the rope.</p>
<p>When he was playing the general, he saw a dirty boy in the crowd, making faces and mocking him, and he ran up to him, about to raise the command knife, wanting to chop him, when the monkey player pulled the rope around his neck and pulled him back to the center of the field to continue the show, so he had to obediently follow the rope.</p>
<p>"Chop... clap... chop... clap..." The children threw copper coins to the monkey player's feet, and they clapped and cheered, saying: "This monkey show is well done!"</p>
<p>The monkey player collected the money and put it in his pocket. He took the monkey to a small restaurant, where he ate and drank until he was drunk and full, but he gave the monkey a little leftover soup to fill his hunger.</p>
<p>Firecrackers Ring All Over the World</p>
<p>A firecracker said to many children: "Don't be afraid of me. You should send me to the sky. Some firecrackers, once they go to the sky, their stomachs are broken, their bodies are shattered, and they make a bang, scaring your guts to pieces and deafening your ears. They are really harmful! I will never be like them. Once I go to the sky, I will never change my stomach, not explode my body, not make scary noises, and not release annoying gunpowder gas. I want to give you peace! Quiet. Hurry up and send me to the sky!"</p>
<p>The children believed her words and lit her gunpowder fuse. The firecracker got fire, look, it窜into the high sky. Wow! How proud he is!</p>
<p>But, you hear: "Bang... bang... clap... clap...!" So loud. Gunpowder gas filled the air, and unrest filled the ground. The children were all scared pale, some hiding, some escaping...</p>
<p>Originally, this firecracker only asked the children to send him to the sky, and the words he promised them at first were just to deceive them.</p>

<h3 id="e231">A Small Study on Tails <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<p>Many animals have tails. Although human tails are no longer visible, it is said that humans also had tails in primitive times. This theory is based on the structure at the end of our spine, and even now some people still have short tails, but the number is extremely small.</p>
<p>Apart from humans, almost all vertebrates have tails. If we observe their skeletons, we can see a series of bone segments, long or short, at the end of their spines, which are easily bent. The closer to the end, the smaller the bone segments, and this is their tail.</p>
<p>The size of the tail varies depending on how a particular animal uses its tail. Most bears have short tails, and the hippopotamus's tail is also disproportionate to its massive body. But some animals have tails that are two or three times longer than their bodies.</p>
<p>In summer, if we carefully observe a cow and see flies bothering it, we can appreciate one of the functions of the tail. At the end of its tail, there is a cluster of slender hairs, which is a tool that makes it more effective in driving away flies.</p>
<p>Some monkeys use their tails to climb trees, or simply hang their bodies upside down from tree branches by their tails. Their tails have gradually become specially adapted for this purpose: we call them "prehensile tails," which means this.</p>
<p>Some animals, because they live in the water a lot, their tails have a rudder-like function. It's not really the fish's, but the great whales use their formidable tails for propulsion in the water. The kangaroo's tail is also extremely developed, and it uses it to support its body weight. When it stands upright, its tail and two hind legs become a very stable tripod, and even a skilled boxer would not easily knock down an upright kangaroo.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples of the functions of the tails of some animals. The tails of many other animals each have their own functions. If you want to know more details, it is best to pay attention to on-site observations at any time.</p>

<p>Scientific Little Question</p>
<h3 id="e232">Why Are Closed-Room Coal Stoves Likely to be Fatal? <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Every time the north wind howls and snowflakes flutter, many middle- and lower-class families who do not have radiators or electric stoves install coal stoves for heating, but installing coal stoves for heating is really not a good idea. Over the years, there have been many reports of people losing their lives due to coal poisoning from heating stoves. Why do people get poisoned? What exactly is the "poison"? Little friends with some scientific minds must want to ask these questions right away, right? Yes, let me tell you:</p>
<p>The main component of coal, coal balls, and charcoal is carbon. Once carbon is burned, it becomes a gas called carbon dioxide. If there is insufficient oxygen in the air, it cannot become carbon dioxide, but becomes carbon monoxide. Although these two terms are only different by two and one when written, carbon dioxide is not dangerous at all, while carbon monoxide can be fatal. Because carbon dioxide has absolutely no effect when inhaled into the lungs, carbon monoxide immediately combines with blood cells after being inhaled, which will make the whole body immediately feel a lack of blood cells and unable to live. Just imagine a closed-room coal stove, waiting for all the limited oxygen in the room to help the coal balls in the stove burn completely. How can carbon monoxide not be produced in the room? How dangerous! I hope everyone pays more attention.</p>
<p>Memory Game</p>
<p>Preparation: About thirty kinds of miscellaneous items, such as pencils, ink, knives, bamboo rulers, watches, envelopes, etc. Experiment: First, number each item and display them in a small room with sufficient light. At this time, the participants are all outside, and are not allowed to peek. Then, record the numbers on prepared paper and distribute them to the participants. With the items pre-arranged properly, have the participants enter in groups (three or four people per group) to carefully view the items for four minutes, then exit and record the items displayed in the room on paper as quickly as possible. The latest time allowed is no more than ten minutes.</p>
<p>Note: This game is simple and easy to implement. I have tried it several times when I was a Boy Scout in elementary school. As a result, the best performers could memorize more than twenty kinds of items. Because the items are mixed and listed in a small room with dazzling light, the nerves of the participants are most easily disturbed by it. (Huaiqing)</p>
<p>Seeking: Five issues of the Shenbao Children's Supplement from January 12th, January 19th, February 2nd, February 9th, and February 16th of this year are requested. If anyone is willing to part with them, please send them to me immediately. I am willing to exchange them for a set of children's humorous story paintings (twelve episodes).</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Over there was the ancient, great temple, hidden away and isolated from the modern, busy, and lively world, with white clouds floating above it all day long, countless crows circling and flying there, the sound of the wind whistling there, and at their feet lay the city of Rome.</p>
<p>Little Nanluo often ran into those great stones, and in a flash, he disappeared behind that dark archway. Bodehi guarded the streets outside, always wondering what magic there was inside that would attract his inseparable friend.</p>
<p>He had tried to run in himself a couple of times to see what was going on, dragging the milk cart up the stone steps, but was always shooed away by a big man in black with silver trim. Afraid that his little master would suffer some disaster, he patiently waited outside until the child came out, then he felt relieved.</p>
<p>Bodehi's unease was not because Xiao Nanluo had gone to this place: he also knew that people had to go to church; the whole village went to the dilapidated little church opposite the red windmill. What made him uneasy was that Xiao Nanluo's expression often changed every time he came out, sometimes his face was flushed, sometimes it turned pale; when he returned home, he sat quietly, not even wanting to play. He was dreaming about something, staring straight at the twilight sky beyond the waterline of the canal, extraordinarily quiet, simply containing melancholy.</p>
<p>Bodehi wondered what it was for. He thought that it was unnatural and should not be for a small child to suddenly become so serious. So he tried his best to get Xiao Nanluo to play with him in the sunny fields, or stroll around the busy market.</p>
<p>But Xiao Nanluo did not go to the small church: he often went to the largest temple; Bodehi waited on the stone steps outside the iron gate, sliding his body and lying on the ground, yawning and sighing, and constantly calling, but to no avail, until the child came out of the iron gate, put his arms around his neck, kissed his yellow broad forehead, and always murmured the same two sentences: "I just want to see them, Bodehi! - I just want to see them!"</p>

<p>The telecommunications business, which is run by the Ministry of Communications, has made remarkable achievements in terms of engineering construction, business improvement, and personnel reorganization, whether in telegraph or telephone. This publication has repeatedly published concise texts and figures based on facts, which are well known to the public. However, telecommunications construction requires a lot of money, such as the purchase of pole lines, the transportation of parts, and the installation of projects, which cannot be done without huge construction costs. The consumption of materials by the National Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus, the salaries of employees, and the expenditure of public funds also require huge maintenance costs. At this time of economic hardship in telecommunications, and without the provision of national treasury subsidies every year, it is quite difficult to maintain the status quo, and it is really difficult to talk about development! The transportation authorities have encountered this difficulty and are thinking about ways to overcome it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those who talk about financial management are nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The former is different for state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and the telecommunications business is different from other state-owned enterprises. There are two ways to increase revenue in telecommunications: on the one hand, the equipment in telecommunications engineering should be improved to the utmost, so that communication efficiency can be increased; on the other hand, the handling of telecommunications business should be extremely simple, so that the public feels satisfied and is happy to use it, then the business will develop and income will naturally increase. These two are the policies currently held by the Ministry of Communications, and have been proven to be quite successful. There are also two ways to reduce expenditure: Reducing construction costs and saving maintenance costs. Compared with European and American countries, China's telecommunications business has lagged behind. If we do not actively build it, how can we form the conditions of a modern country? Therefore, construction costs must increase every year, and there is really no possibility of reducing them. As for saving maintenance costs, it can be implemented as much as possible under the principle of not hindering engineering construction and business development. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications' method of reducing expenditure focuses on saving maintenance costs, which is in line with the principle of industrial rationalization.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that "Due to the deficit in telecommunications, the Ministry of Communications should strive to contract. From February 25th, all maintenance material costs for various telegraph bureaus and radio stations, as well as miscellaneous transportation expenses for line maintenance workers, will be reduced by 10% according to the estimated amount. The maintenance material costs for various telephone switchboards and lines will be reduced by 20%, saving a total of more than one million yuan." This sum of more than one million yuan would be a normal expenditure in times of economic abundance, and there would be no criticism. If it can be contracted by one cent in times of economic difficulty, it will have a one-cent effect. During the national crisis, it should be even more necessary to implement contraction and work hard. We deeply admire the hard work of the transportation authorities.</p>
<p>"Contraction" and "development" seem to be contradictory but actually complementary terms. "Contraction" should be within the scope of not hindering the "development" of the business, and seeking "contraction" in "development" will enable the business to move forward. "Development" should use "contraction" as a means, and seeking "development" in "contraction" will enable the business to be maintained. The "contraction" policy recently implemented by the Ministry of Communications implies the use of the "development" policy, and the "development" policy to be implemented in the future will receive the results of the "contraction" policy. That is, "contraction" is "development," and "development" is "contraction." Only by understanding the principles in this can we talk about the economic policies implemented by modern countries.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Requesting the Military Authorities to Find Ways to Stop the Tapping of Military Telephones on Telegraph Lines <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>For the sake of maintaining local security and suppressing the remaining bandits, the local garrison often taps military telephones on telegraph lines to communicate news. The reporter believes that tapping military telephones on telegraph lines not only hinders communication of news, but also inevitably makes military communications difficult. Therefore, he wrote in detail about its advantages and disadvantages in the 46th issue of this publication, and extended his hopes for the understanding of the military authorities. However, in recent months, the tapping of military telephones on telegraph lines has been heard from time to time. Although the transportation authorities have communicated with them in writing, there has been little effect. The reporter deeply knows that the act of tapping military telephones has a great impact on telecommunications and the general public, and he urgently hopes to fulfill his civic duty, express his views, and appeal to our military authorities again.</p>
<p>According to recent years, in order to promote telephone traffic, the Ministry of Communications has specially opened long-distance telephones on telegraph branch lines in various regions as much as possible to facilitate communication. Therefore, the circuits are used for both telegraphs and telephones, and the load is already very heavy in peacetime. If it is occupied by the military, not only will the load increase and communication be blocked, but also because the branch lines are all single-line connections, there will inevitably be excessive leakage, and it will be impossible to make calls. Therefore, occupying money for communication is a harmful and unhelpful act when it is not a last resort. Even if you want to make a call, you must consult with the local telegraph bureau to find a proper way to connect and open the money, so as to avoid all difficulties. This should be noted by the military authorities.</p>
<p>In addition to being open to the public, inland long-distance telephones must also be used for highway traffic communication. Therefore, the smooth flow of telephone calls is of great importance to the safety of traffic. Recently, long-distance telephones along the Xi'an (from Chang'an, Shaanxi to Lanzhou, Gansu) highway were occupied by the military, resulting in serious danger. We understand the military authorities' painstaking efforts to maintain security, but we must also take into account the current facts and make thorough contacts with the relevant parties, so that both parties can benefit! This should be noted by the military authorities.</p>
<p>Although, as far as we know, the military authorities have also repeatedly ordered the prohibition of tapping military telephones on telegraph lines. However, in order to save trouble, the local garrison often acts expediently. We hope that the military authorities will thoroughly inform the relevant troops, or issue temporary telephone regulations for marching, and implement them earnestly, so as to seek the flexibility of military communications without hindering the principle of public communication. This is also what we would like to ask the military authorities to pay attention to.</p>
<p>In short, what we ask the military authorities to cooperate with are the following points: Please do not tap military telephones unless it is a last resort. If you want to tap military telephones, please control the communication troops and implement them earnestly. If the above three points can be implemented, we believe that it will benefit both telecommunications and military communications.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Main Uses of Telegraph in Commerce <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Gong</p>
<p>In modern times, commerce has progressed, and the techniques of competition have also progressed. Commercial competition is the same as military competition, and both require weapons, so it is called "commercial warfare," but the methods and nature are different. There are different weapons in commercial warfare, and the telegraph is one of them. The concept that "military affairs require speed" also applies to commercial warfare. Therefore, the telegraph occupies an important position in commerce because of its unique speed. Up to now, all intelligent and insightful businessmen use the telegraph to flexibly handle all matters of commercial exchange, because this is the only way to achieve the effect of "responding to the opportunity quickly." Although it requires some telegraph fees, the benefits gained far exceed hundreds or thousands of times! However, there are still many people in the business world who do not know how to use this powerful weapon to compete with others. Most of these people do not understand the importance and use of the telegraph in commerce, so they cannot profit as much as those who make good use of the telegraph. It is really a pity! We who serve in the telecommunications industry have always treated business people equally, regardless of rank. We hope that everyone can enjoy the benefits of the telegraph, and we do not want it to be exclusively enjoyed by a part of the people or a certain class. Therefore, we have specially written out the main uses of the telegraph in commerce and made them public so that people can have "equal opportunity"!</p>
<p>Ordering: If a business knows that there is a need for a certain type of goods locally, and this type of goods is extremely scarce in the market and needs to be purchased from other places, the most appropriate and rapid method is to use the telegraph. This method can avoid the rise in prices and prevent the loss of the opportunity to sell. I can give a simple example to prove the effectiveness of telegraph ordering: I remember in the summer of the year before last, the weather in Nanjing was very hot, and the Jinpu Railway Office transported a batch of Texas watermelons, which were large and sweet, and they were immediately sold out in the market. A local fruit merchant saw that these Texas melons were popular and believed that there was a profit to be made, so he sent a telegram to the Texas melon merchants to order a large batch, and began to pre-sell them. Before the goods arrived, they had already been disposed of, and the profits tripled. At the same time, several other fruit merchants also ordered goods from Texas, but unfortunately they used mail. By the time the letters had been exchanged and the negotiations had been completed, and the goods had arrived in Beijing, the hot weather had subsided, and the selling price had plummeted. This business almost lost money. The stores that did not use telegraph ordering could only sigh at their bad luck!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Contraction Policy <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Payment: The use of telegraphs to demand payment is not yet popular in our country, but it has been practiced for many years in European and American countries and is very common. Now demand telegraphs occupy an important position in telegraph operations in European and American countries, which shows that they are generally effective. Originally, there are indeed advantages to using telegraphs to demand payment. The first is speed, which can avoid the drawbacks of delaying days in letter exchanges and obtain the benefit of collecting the principal and interest of the payment early. The second is reliability. In our country, people generally have the psychology that "telegrams are urgent." If telegraphs are used to demand payment, it will of course easily attract the attention of the payer and have them pay off the bill as soon as possible. If there is unstable news about the customer, using telegraphs to demand payment is indeed fast and effective.</p>
<p>Reporting Accounts: Some people in our country have already used telegraphs to report accounts, but not very many. In European and American countries, it has been popular for a while. Large businesses with many branches mostly use this system to control the finances of branches in various places. Therefore, it is very convenient for the head office to investigate the daily accounts of branches in various places. In this way, the problem of branches obscuring accounts will naturally not occur. In recent years, there have been many emerging large businesses and factories in various parts of our country. For the sake of business safety, it is really necessary to use telegraphs to report accounts.</p>
<p>Reporting Market Prices: Market price fluctuations are related to business gains and losses. If you use letters to report, it will take days and the losses will be worrying. If you use telegraphs to report, then you will know immediately when it goes up or down! What kind of goods should be entered or sold, and what kind of goods should be purchased more or less, can be done with the market price telegram as a compass. Earning profits in business can be held in your hand.</p>
<p>In addition, such as being unable to turn around and asking others for help; remittance checks being stopped for some reason; a lack of finished goods and notifying them to rush production; and sudden changes in the market and reporting news, etc., can all use the telegraph to transmit and obtain satisfactory results. In short, the uses of the telegraph in commerce are extremely wide and broad. Due to the limited space in this publication, we cannot list them all one by one. The key lies in the businessman's ability to use it well.</p>
<h3 id="e239">News Telegraphs and News Telephones <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>According to Article 68 of the International Telegraph Convention, all telegrams whose texts are exclusively devoted to news such as political business news, for publishing in newspapers and other periodicals, are permitted to be charged at a reduced rate as news telegrams. Based on this principle, the Ministry of Communications specially reduces the price of news telegrams to one-quarter of the ordinary telegram price, and has formulated a type of news telegram regulations, which stipulates in detail the methods for sending news telegrams.</p>
<p>The reason why news telegrams are given special treatment is that newspapers, in addition to being businesses, also contain a kind of social education meaning. Their role is not only for the transmission of news and the release of political information. For example, the promotion of national culture and the instilling of people's knowledge are greatly dependent on newspapers for their promotion. The level of cultural standards of a country and the popularity of social education can be estimated from the number of newspapers and other periodicals. However, in addition to the local news, most of the pages of newspapers are news materials provided by various domestic and foreign sources. This material, known as news, must be the latest news. If it discloses materials that have lost their timeliness, it is inevitable that there will be a "yesterday's flower" reproach. In order to seek the latest news, its transmission must be mainly swift, so the news from various places mostly relies on telegram transmission, which is the so-called news telegram. If news telegrams must also be charged at the same rate as ordinary telegrams, then this telegram fee will inevitably be very large. General newspaper companies have limited capital and will naturally find it difficult to bear, which will directly affect the business of newspapers and indirectly hinder the development of cultural undertakings. Therefore, all countries unanimously recognize that news telegrams should be charged at a reduced price compared to ordinary telegrams.</p>
<p>Some say: "Telegrams and telephones are both powerful tools for communication. Since news telegrams can be given preferential treatment and reduced prices, why can't we follow this precedent and stipulate a news telephone price reduction method? And why does the International Telegraph Convention only have regulations on news telegrams and not on news telephones? What is the reason?" This statement is not unreasonable from one aspect, but from another aspect, if we analyze the fundamental differences between telegrams and telephones, it is not difficult to understand why news telephones are uniquely lacking. According to the significant difference between telegrams and telephones, the content transmitted by telegrams is expressed in words, while telephones rely solely on dialogue. How is the content of what the two parties are talking about? Third parties have no way of finding out. Moreover, since news telegrams are only charged one-quarter of the ordinary telegram price, the content of their transmission should be absolutely limited to news. Therefore, Article 16 of the News Telegram Regulations stipulates: "The text of news telegrams is limited to news about politics and commerce that is to be published in newspapers or periodicals, and must not contain words of a private nature or similar to advertisements." Article 69 of the International Telegraph Regulations also stipulates: "News telegrams must not contain sentences of a private nature." The sincerity is that news telegrams are charged at a specially low rate. If it is not regulated, it is inevitable that someone will use the name of news telegrams to transmit telegrams that do not conform to the nature of news in order to gain cleverness. It is very obvious whether the content of telegrams, which are expressed in words, is consistent with news telegrams. As for telephones, it is difficult to verify whether the questions and answers between each other conform to news telephones. For this reason, there are no precedents for specially reducing the price of news telephones in various countries. Whether it is a city telephone installed by news reporters, newspapers, or magazine companies, or a long-distance telephone sent, the fees are charged according to regulations. However, in terms of long-distance telephones, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have night-time call price reduction methods to ease the volume of calls. Although this method applies to the entire public, it is especially beneficial to news undertakings because news telephone calls are mostly made at night.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications of our country also formulated the night-time call price reduction method for long-distance telephones last year, stipulating that the night-time prices of all ordinary and expedited calls should be calculated at 70% of the daytime prices. From December 1st of last year, it was first tried out in seven places: Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, and Wuxian for three months. After its implementation, all sectors of the news media deeply felt the convenience. Now that the trial period has expired at the end of February, it is heard that the Ministry of Communications believes that the results of the past three months of trial operation have been very good, and intends to continue to hold it, which is also a kind of preferential treatment for news telephones.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Supplement to the Regulations on Paid Public Telegram Charges <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>The content and advantages of the newly revised unified regulations on paid public telegram charges have been published in this journal. It is assumed that most senders and receivers are already familiar with its application, so there is no need for further explanation. The various provisions in these regulations apply equally to all Chinese and foreign language telegrams. Therefore, Article 3 stipulates: "If the sender supplements or corrects any part of the original telegram, all supplemented or corrected words shall be charged per word." However, the above provision is considered slightly inconvenient for senders supplementing or correcting the name and address of the recipient of a Chinese telegram. For example, if a sender sends the following telegram: "Shanghai Jianghai Customs Huang Zi'an 'Funds remitted'" and the receiving office informs that the recipient is no longer at Jianghai Customs and the telegram cannot be delivered, and the sender intends to use a paid public telegram to notify the receiving office to correct the recipient's name and address to "283 Dunhou Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, Huang Ziliang," a total of fourteen characters. According to the aforementioned charging regulations, a fee of one yuan and forty cents should be paid for fourteen characters. However, if the sender does not use a paid public telegram, but sends another telegram as follows: "Shanghai French Concession Avenue Joffre Dunhou Lane 283 Huang Ziliang—Funds remitted," according to the current General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Business (the receiving location name is counted as two characters, the recipient's name and address are counted as three characters, and the telegram text is counted as three characters), the entire telegram only requires a fee of eighty cents, which is cheaper than sending a paid public telegram by sixty cents. Therefore, the provisions of Article 3 of the paid public telegram charging regulations are quite inconvenient for short Chinese telegrams. Now, the Ministry of Communications has instructed that Article 3 of the current unified paid public telegram charging regulations be supplemented and revised as follows:</p>
<p>"If the sender supplements or corrects any part of the original telegram, all supplemented or corrected words shall be charged per word (for example, supplementing an address of two characters shall be charged for two characters, correcting one character of the telegram text shall be charged for one character). However, if the sender supplements or corrects the recipient's address of a Chinese private telegram, all supplemented or corrected words shall be charged according to the provisions of Article 83 of the General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Business. (For example, if supplementing or correcting the address of a common language telegram in Chinese does not exceed thirteen characters, it shall be charged as three characters.)"</p>
<p>After the implementation of the above supplementary measures, if a sender uses a paid public telegram to supplement or correct the recipient's name and address of a Chinese telegram, all supplemented or corrected words can be charged according to the provisions of Article 83 of the General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Business. That is, if the recipient's name and address, totaling no more than thirteen characters in plain language or no more than fourteen characters in code, can be charged as three or four characters respectively. If this limit is exceeded, additional charges will be added. Then, even though the above paid public telegram supplementing the recipient's name and address has as many as fourteen characters, only a fee of forty cents needs to be paid, which is still cheaper than sending another telegram. The general sender will certainly be happy to adopt it, in order to save money. From this, it can be seen that although the supplementary modification of the paid public telegram charging regulations is a small reform, it is quite beneficial to the sender.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Progress Overview of the Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Project <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is planning to establish long-distance telephone lines in nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. This is the largest telecommunications project in recent years. After the entire project is completed, the major cities in the above provinces will be able to communicate with each other, which will greatly benefit public communications and is of no small significance. The construction progress may be something that the public is interested in hearing about. The progress is described as follows:</p>
<p>Since the scope of this long-distance telephone project is too wide and the lines are long, the names of the planned lines are determined first, and each line is planned into several sections, and then the construction is carried out in sections. Therefore, since the start of construction, the progress of pole erection and line installation has been quite rapid. The following eight lines have been completed:</p>
<p>Jinan to Qingdao line. The Jinan-Qingdao section already had two pairs of long-distance telephone lines open for communication. Now, after adding and reconstructing, there are three pairs of telephone lines and one pair of phantom lines. With the increase in lines, communication will naturally be more convenient.</p>
<p>The line installation project between Suzhou and Jiaxing was completed on February 15th.</p>
<p>The completed sections of the Nanjing-Tianjin long-distance telephone line include the Nanjing-Xuzhou section and the Jinan-Tianjin section.</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Hankou long-distance telephone line is divided into five sections. Among them, the completed sections include Nanjing-Shunan, Hukou-Yangxin, and Yangxin-Hankou. The sections still under construction are Shunan-Gujiahui Anqing, and Yinjiahui-Hukou.</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Hangzhou long-distance telephone line is divided into two sections. The Yixing-Wuxing section has been completed, and the Wuxing-Hangzhou section will begin construction soon. The line is short, so the completion date should not be far off.</p>
<p>The Hankou-Changsha long-distance telephone line is also divided into two sections. The completed section is Hankou-Yueyang, and the remaining Yueyang-Changsha section is under construction and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>There was already a direct telegraph line between Tongshan and Zhengxian. It has now been decided to add long-distance telephone lines to the existing poles to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The line addition project will begin soon.</p>
<p>The long-distance line installation project between Zhengxian and Hankou is currently being carried out in five sections and will also begin construction soon.</p>
<p>As for the other lines, they are either being planned and carried out, or will soon begin construction. The completion of the entire project is not far off. Many members of the public are concerned about this long-distance telephone project, so a brief report on its actual progress is presented.</p>

<p>Navigation Safety: Adoption of Unique Electrical Machinery</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce recently stipulated new regulations to enhance navigation safety and facilitate rescue operations. It ordered regular transport ships sailing on the ocean to equip their lifeboats with a radio capable of transmitting signals over a distance of at least fifty miles. In case of distress, maritime rescue agencies or other ships within a fifty-mile radius can rush to rescue without delay. This electrical machinery can still operate normally when splashed with seawater. Even if completely submerged in seawater, it will not completely lose its efficiency in a short period of time. It is reported that this regulation will be implemented from New Year's Day this year.</p>
<p>Creation of Wireless Wind and Rain Detection</p>
<p>The invention of a wireless wind detector can not only respond to the movements of future hurricanes, but also measure snowfall, blowing sand, and various climate changes. According to testers, this device can distinguish various storms and emit different influences. Using this method, accurate records can be kept of the nature, location, path, and speed of future wind and rain. After repeated testing, even very subtle snow, wind, and rain can be measured and obtained, and can reach a distance of three hundred miles.</p>
<h3 id="e243">The Significance of the Ministry of Communications' Survey of Broadcast Listeners' Opinions <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhou</p>
<p>The most important and most difficult problem to solve in rectifying the broadcasting industry is the broadcasting program. Now, the engineering design of a broadcasting station is of great importance. However, it only needs a one-time rectification. Even if there are shortcomings, it will only cause unstable frequencies and interference, making the broadcast sound not very clear. If the broadcasting program needs constant attention, and if it is not handled properly, the effect will not be achieved and the harm will be endless.</p>
<p>How can a broadcasting program be considered appropriate? The purpose of running a broadcasting business should be considered first. The purpose of running a broadcasting business can be put very simply: "Promote proper entertainment and promote social education." If this statement is not flawed, then the broadcasting program should contain two elements, namely "interest" and "educational significance." These two elements each have their limits. If each broadcasting station only considers the "interest" element, they often cater to the public's psychology, lower the standard, and broadcast extremely vulgar and crude programs, which are detrimental to social morality. If only the "educational element" is considered, using the function of broadcasting to promote academics, announce government orders, and convey news, this is certainly not objectionable, but given the lack of widespread education in our country and the low desire for knowledge among the public, how many of the hundreds of thousands of radio users can sit upright and listen respectfully to this kind of program lacking "interest" after a day of tiring work? Its actual effect is actually very small. Generally speaking, most people who install radios do so for leisure and entertainment, focusing on the "interest" element, while those responsible for supervision, standing in the position of the government, often focus on the "education" element. Historically, the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly rectified broadcasting programs over the years, such as prohibiting the broadcast of lewd songs and tunes, and adding programs about party principles, civic common sense, and brief histories of national heroes. Its intentions are indeed far-reaching.</p>
<p>However, although broadcasting programs have been actively rectified by the Ministry of Communications, many broadcasting stations still often comply in appearance but defy in reality, and cannot effectively comply, resulting in frequent criticism from the outside. Examining the reason, most listeners take "interest" as a prerequisite. In order to attract more listeners and develop business, each broadcasting station has to make many concessions. Therefore, to effectively rectify broadcasting programs, it is necessary to adopt a more progressive method, which is to find ways to improve the level of listeners. The Ministry of Communications, in view of this, in order to examine the psychology of listeners and guide them accordingly, has developed the following survey form on broadcast listeners' opinions:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications has decided to pilot the survey in Shanghai and Peiping first. The Shanghai International Telecommunications Bureau and the Peiping Telegraph Bureau have distributed the survey forms to local broadcast listeners to fill out. After all the forms are collected in the future, the Ministry plans to conduct a detailed review and analysis, and it is expected that the following results can be obtained.</p>
<p>What kind of programs are popular with listeners.</p>
<p>What are the different views of people in various industries on program interests?</p>
<p>Which broadcasting station do listeners consider satisfactory?</p>
<p>What are the criteria by which listeners evaluate broadcasting stations?</p>
<p>What special opinions do listeners have on broadcasting programs?</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications will use the above results as a reference for rectifying broadcasting programs, and will also be able to use this to assess the performance of each broadcasting station. All radio users in Peiping and Shanghai should fill out the survey forms promptly and truthfully upon receipt, in order to facilitate the progress.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Q&amp;A Column <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>This publication has specially opened a Q&amp;A column. Members of the public who have questions about telegram and telephone sending and receiving procedures, or who do not understand the telecommunications regulations, or who have inquiries about telecommunications common sense, are welcome to submit their questions and we will answer them.</p>
<p>1. Jiangdu Liu Shiqi asks: I have secretly checked Article 112 of the General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Business, which states that the number of copies for telegram distribution should be equal to the number of recipient addresses and names. "For example, if the whole telegram has two recipient addresses and names, it should be stated "Distribute two copies," and the copy fee will also be charged for two copies." I think that the copy fee should be calculated excluding the original. For example, if the whole telegram has two recipient addresses and names, only one copy fee should be paid, because the telegraph office will naturally translate and send the original telegram to the first recipient, so there is no so-called copying, and it seems that the copy fee cannot be charged.</p>
<p>(Answer) When distributing telegrams for copying, except for the recipient addresses and names listed in the official military telegrams, each copy only contains one recipient address and name that should be listed in that copy. The remaining recipient names and addresses and the payment business identification "Number of copies to be distributed" or (mT) are not listed according to regulations. Each receiving office should copy and send the distributed telegram according to the number of copies indicated in the incoming telegram. The original can only be kept by the office as the basis for investigation. The copying procedures have not been reduced. Therefore, the number of copies for the copy fee of distributed telegrams should be calculated according to the number of recipient names and addresses contained in the original telegram.</p>
<p>2. Guiyang Wang Zicheng asks: How should the fee be charged for sending or copying a telegram in this city using a telegraph machine, and how should the fee be charged for sending a telegram from the bandit suppression army in this city? Please let me know.</p>
<p>(Answer) The fee for sending a telegram in this city, whether transmitted by machine or copied, is charged according to the local price. (That is, the fee is charged at one-quarter of the original price.) As for the bandit suppression army telegrams, a material fee of fifty cents per hundred words should still be charged according to regulations.</p>
<p>3. Nanjing Hu Jie asks: I previously installed a telephone. Now I plan to transfer it to a friend. The telephone does not need to be moved. I don't know how much the telephone bureau needs for the procedure fee?</p>
<p>(Answer) Users who voluntarily come to the bureau to change the name or transfer the account do not need to pay a name change fee or a transfer fee. If the bureau is not notified and it is found out, a name change fee of five yuan or a transfer fee of ten yuan should be paid. Please refer to the "Name Change and Transfer" section of Chapter 6 of the Ministry of Communications' General Regulations for City Telephone Business.</p>
