<p>柏林　希特勒元首頃將羅卡諾公的宣告廢止，並經由外交部通告該公約簽字各國大使、德國軍隊亦已開入萊茵河非武裝區域、（七日哈瓦斯急電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首宣告廢止羅卡諾公的之後、當向簽字各國提議、磋商新的以替代之、并聲明德國願重返國聯會、但附有條件（七日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>科侖　德國重佔萊茵區之行動、今晨五時開始、德軍先入在柯洛業對面萊茵河東岸德資鎮、旋於民衆狂慹歡呼聲中入麥恩士·柯白倫士·柯洛業·與佛蘭福特四城、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>科侖　德國車用飛機多架，頃於本日在此間上空飛翔、居民均向之歡呼、城中各街道、并有軍隊與坦克車遊行、按科侖城、位於萊茵河非武裝區域、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國宣告廢止羅卡諾公的之後、法國政府頃决定將此項問題、提付國聯會行政院討論、國聯會行政院定於本月十日開會、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國宣告廢止羅卡諾公的、并遣派軍隊開入萊茵河沿岸非武裝區域之後、法國陸軍自本日晚間為始、或卽停止給假、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　國防大員及陸軍正副總司令皆已奉召趕至巴黎、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國元首希特勒宣告廢止羅卡諾公的之後、法國駐德大使龐賽、當卽報告本國政府、薩勞總理於接獲報告之後、亦卽召集外交部長佛蘭亭、不管部閣員彭古、陸軍部長摩冷將軍、郵電部長芒德爾、（兼管亞爾薩斯、洛林兩省事務）在總統府集會、并邀請陸軍總參謀長甘茂林將軍出席、事後薩勞總理宣稱、佛蘭亭外長、當於本日午後、接見羅卡諾公的各簽字國代表、卽英·意·比·三國大使、討論德國宣吿廢約所可引起之影響、內閣定於午後六時開會　幷於星期日舉行國務會議云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國政界對德國吾認洛迦諾公的所引起之當局、謹守「鎮靜」二字、政府邀請該的簽字國代表除德國者外於午後六時在外交部集議後、佛蘭亭將於今夜對報界發表言論、以答希特勒之演說及德國吾認洛迦諾公的之公文、現信法國將依據洛迦諾公的所定之手續及凡爾賽和的第四十四條（如德國以任何狀態違反第四十二條與第四十三條內之一切規定、都將視德國對簽字本的之各國作敵對行動、而擾亂世界之和平）、向國聯請願、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　倫敦當局現不願評論希特勒宣言所引起之局勢、聞須通盤研究後、始能發表意見、現悉希氏發表宣言之前一夕、英國曾向德國表示願與締結西方天空協定、英外相艾登今晨會與法意大使比代使會談、後赴奇克斯會晤首相包爾溫、內閣末舉行特別會議、惟閣員將在豫定星期一日閣議中討論德國之行動、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意政府對於希特勒吾認洛迦諾公的之宣言、毫無不悅之態、且對於宜言中述及殖民地及德國復加入國聯一節、尤為滿意、蓋意國覺國聯現太為英法兩國所左右、有德國之加入、可使權力為之平衡也、現悉德政府曾於上週中商勸墨索里尼同行吾認洛迦諾公的、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　德國宣告廢止羅卡諾公的之後、此間官塲人士宣稱、意德兩國關於此項問題、并未成立協定、意國當局對於意德兩國密切合作一層、亦未有所决定云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　國聯各界現信德國吾認洛迦諾公的之行動、不致發生軍事後果、有由國聯特別會議和平解决之可能性、官塲對於希特勒宣言之意見以為希特勒宣言中如不附以吾認德國自願加入之洛迦諾公約、則此舉可大有助於歐洲之安全、乃德國甯願取頑强之方針、照會法國、謂法俄互助倏的如經批准、則德國將目以為已脫離洛迦諾公的云、衆覺希氏之演說、乃欲於英法親密之關係中間加入一楔、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於萊茵河左岸非武裝區域重行設防一項問題、牛賴特外長、頃於本日晨間、接見法國駐德大使龐賽、并向之宣稱、德國陸軍僅有</p>
<p>少數部隊、開入非武裝區域、作為一種表示、并無意遣派大批隊伍前往該處云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國今日宣布、不承認以萊茵為不駐兵區域之洛迦諾公的後、卽派兵入萊茵地、此舉已使全歐震駭、洛迦諾公的簽字國卽英法意比四國之駐德大使、交以德元首希特勒文告、內載要點如下、</p>
<p>德國因法俄互助條的、故不滿意於洛迦諾公約、</p>
<p>德國自以為不受不駐兵區域條文之拘束、　如比法亦有不駐兵區域、則德國凖備依允有新的不駐兵區域、　如英意兩國為担保人、則德國願簽立二十五年西方不侵犯公的、　德國願允荷蘭加入此的、　德國願締結西方天空公的及東方連立陶宛在內之不侵略公的、上述六項、如獲依允、則德國準備復入國聯、但國聯盟約必須與凡爾賽和的分離、德國來文復向各大使聲明德國現派兵士數營入萊茵地、此為一種表示意思之行動、而非欲以武力復佔領此區域云（七日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">德自稱願與英法　締結天空公約　荷蘭政府表示贊成 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首本日在衆議院發表演說、對於法德兩國關係、亦有所說明、其言曰、德國對於法國、有所努力、　德國曾因軍備問題、向法國提出確切之建議案、　德國前於去年六月間、與英國締結海軍協定、此乃縮减軍備之唯一協定、　德國曾提議、依據平等原則、而由德法英三國締結天空協定云、（七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>海牙　荷蘭政府將考慮德國所倡締結包括荷蘭在內互不侵犯公的之議、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c3">希特勒向衆院　發表重要演說　廢止羅卡諾公維原因　在於法俄訂互援條約 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>柏林　德國會特會甚形擁擠、首由普總理戈林將軍宣布開會、繼由德元首希特發言、有傳聲機將演詞傳達於衆、大劇院門外之公園與大街中駐聽者甚多、</p>
<p>不滿現狀　希氏許、戈林將軍奉其命召集此會、一般聚當　然認此會極關重耍、德國因威爾遜總統十三要點所造成之新思想、與國聯之設立、已受重大之犧牲、今日國際間空氣緊張、前所未有、戰神尚未解甲、但以視前更甚之軍備巡行世界各處、此種情勢、德國不負其責、在過去十二年中、德國非為主治國、但為被治國、和的非根據有政治家風度之原則而擬成者、但草創於恐怖與仇恨之空氣中、絕未有可使鄰國間成立耐久的和平之基礎、德國從未破壞歐洲和平、凡解决歐洲難題之任何努力、而不顧及文化與民族者適造成各方面所不願有之時局耳云、</p>
<p>德國問題　希氏在鼓掌聲中言及國家團結之重要、謂德國問題甚囂塵上、此不與德國政體有關、但為六千萬德人之問題、吾德人固與法人或英人有同樣之需要也、外國報紙以不公道之言論討論德國之困難、須知他國强令德國借價、繼而破壞德國出口貿易、終則責備德國無還債之誠意、苟經濟與政治事件早日適當解决、則歐洲不知有去許多煩惱、歐洲各國乃一個家庭、雖有時鬩牆、但其關係固極密切也、捨常識而不用、則必有爆裂、而留禍患於將來、在許多人觀之、其所謂德國問題者、乃德國之嗜戰、及其經略他國之野心、與征服敵國之能力、要之、德人勤勉不遜於其他歐人、而欲有與他人同樣之生活權利、德人亦猶法人或英人、不願為癲在主義、視死如歸也、心氣和平之法入與英人、當能了解此種間題、</p>
<p>蘇俄干涉　德國所遭遇之一個難題、為蘇俄對德之干涉、余决計解决凡爾賽和的所成立之難題、過去三年中之德國重置軍備、非欲復活歐洲難題、但欲解决歐洲問題耳、余在過去三年中、屢欲謀取對法之諒解、而卒無效、余不知何以不能重視歐洲之難題、而輕視細微之仇忌情戚、至於俄國、則余反對與之合作、以其有使全世界布爾希維主義化之目的也、</p>
<p>法俄互援　今日吾人聞法俄盟的已露端倪、余為法德諒解工作三年、自信可稍有成就、然而余之種種提議、悉遭拒絕、惟英政府有務實之觀念者、已接受余所倡海軍限制協定之提議、此乃軍縮努力之唯一結果、余所擬之天空洛迦諾公的、亦遭拒絕、余若掀動德國人民、使之恢復、其事固較提倡國際諒解為易、但余不若是也、余在心理方面之準備上致力較其他任何政治家為多、蓋謀取接近之願意、較諸造成糾紛的盟約之努力允關重要也、法俄互助條的、違反洛迦諾精神、較諸法國所締結之任何其他條的更屬嚴重、布爾希維克主義不將蔓延於法國乎、法國不將成第二莫斯科乎、將於他日見之也、余近曾對法國新聞記者發表談片、但此談片、法國秘不發表、直至衆院通過法俄條約後、始披露之、余於此不僅為歐洲諒解服務、且亦遵從國民之志願、吾國民甯願飽嘗艱辛、而不願放棄其榮譽與自由也云、</p>
<p>宣吿廢約　希氏言至此、乃宣讀德國致法之牒文、內載七點、並聲明法俄條的係對德而發、法國依據此的、將被逼而敵視德國、與國聯原則相反、該說帖又稱、法俄條的破壞洛迦諾公約、法國對捷克與對俄之諒解、將有害於和平、希氏後乃宣佈重佔萊茵地、眾聞之歡呼數分鑛、最後希氏追叙過去三年中國社黨工作、希氏發言一時半之久、午後一時三十五分、戈林將軍宣布三月二十八日國會解散、二十九日舉行新選舉、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c4">戈林宣布　衆院月底改選　由人民複决外交政策 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>柏林　衆議院本日開會、希特勒元首發表演說之後、議長卽航空部長戈林將軍、卽繼起發言云、衆議院定於本月二十九日改選、人民得就政府自三年以來與各國爭取平　權利所行之外交政策、加以酌奪云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　衆議院頃於本日十二時開會、主席議長兼航空部長戈林、希特勒元首當將政府關於廢止羅卡諾公的一事、致送各簽字國大使之照會、提出宣讀、并發表長篇演說、衆議院開會之前、自總理公署以至衆議院一帶街道、卽由黑衫軍担任警衛、開會時、各閣員、參謀部各人員、暨外交團、均皆到塲、議塲佈置、極為樸素、當希特勒元首步入議塲時、全體議員暨旁聽席諸人、一致起立致敬、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c5">希特勒　竟日草演說辭　並與陸軍將領會議 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>柏林　德衆院將於今日正午召集衆料此將為非常重大之會議、希特勒將蒞會發重要性質之長演說、希氏咋以全日之時間草擬之演說詞、今晨始能藏事、同時德政府已請英法意比四國大使於今晨至外交部、以聆關於洛迦諾公的之宣言、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　聞德國現準備以關於德國西陲之擔保給予法比兩國、此間聞此消息、大為震動、蓋恐將激恕法國而取軍事上之報復也、衆意希特勒不致發哀的美敦書、或已成事實昭示世界、惟其吾認凡爾賽和的與洛迦諾公的關於萊茵河區域條文、將為一種姿勢、希特勒曾於忽遽中召集德國陸軍將領會議、討論此事、聞高級將領表示意見、以武力重佔萊茵河區域將引起危險、今日德國陸軍之實力尚不能應付裕如、但希氏殊不謂然、仍堅持其主張、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">歐洲時局緊張　英財相謂不能熟視無覩 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>倫敦　財相張伯倫昨夜在白明漢演說、謂世界他處現所發生之事、吾人不能閉目無覩、吾人必須使吾國安全、政府决造能重創敵力之空軍、庶敵方不敢遽開戰禍、吾人不望有戰爭、吾人希望永遠無戰事、但吾人不可預防萬一云、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>— 禹</p>
<p>我國財政現因新公債方案之施行暫獲喘息之機會然欲謀根本解决則除改善政治的經濟的條件外整飭現行稅制自屬必要政府近方作開徵遺產稅之籌備財部所擬草案已吿完竣俟中政會核定完成立法程序後卽可開辦矣</p>
<p>遺產稅以繼承財產爲課稅對象乃租稅中最公平最合理最近代化之良稅財政學者初雖視此爲移轉財產時國家徵取其手績費之登記的性質現則公認爲非由個人努力之偶然的不勞利得稅矣蓋此稅係在繼承後徵收之與遺產人之勞力已無關係也</p>
<p>遺產稅課稅之方法有二一爲對於遺產總額課稅具有財產稅之性質一爲對於遺產繼承分課稅純屬不勞偶然利得稅現世界各國遺產稅制度日本僅採取後者英法則兩者兼具美國則前者爲聯邦稅後者屬各州州稅德國於一九一九年雖有遺產總額課稅但一九二二年後已將前者歸納於後者中矣</p>
<p>我國政府對於遺產稅倡議甚早民國十八年及二十三年兩决全國財政會議均曾有遺產稅之决議乃以阻礙過多迄未實施今財部旣有進一步之具體計劃當能打破過去之因循而在不久之將來開徵此項新稅吾人於此願爲政府告者　累進稅率不宜過低以免失去調劑國民經濟之意義　調査評價工作務求公正精確以杜流弊財政常局倘能注意以上二點則遺產稅庶可推行盡利矣</p>

<p>— Loius　Fisher作　賓符譯</p>
<p>——殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之四　（上）</p>
<p>墨索里尼是深信戰爭的無上權威的。「法西斯主義」，他在一九三二年曾經這樣寫著：「决不以為永久和平是可能的或是有望的。為什麼呢？因為只有戰爭纔能極度發揮人類的一切力量，牠給那些能夠公開作戰的國家加上了莊嚴的冠冕，任何其他的嘗試是不能跟戰爭比擬的。」</p>
<p>一九二五年十二月十一日，墨索里尼對下院說：「我把意大利國家當作永遠處於戰爭的狀態中。我曾經說過，而且耍反覆說者，以後的五年或十年，正是決定我們國家命運的生死關頭。這幾年為什麼成為生死關頭呢？因為國際間的鬥爭已經開始了。牠將隨時代的推進而更加尖銳，我們以全力出現於世界舞台是不甘後人的。」在掌聲雷動中他又說下去：「至於我，生存就是為了戰爭，為了冒險，為了拚命。」這就是墨索里尼對歐洲忠誠的告誡。自然，沒有人聽他的。</p>
<p>惟恐有人對他的志向還有疑惑，他在一九二五年十二月十一日又重述了一次。「法西斯意大利的根本義務，」他說，「便是充實海陸空的軍備。我們必須能夠動員五百萬人，我們必須加强我們的艦隊。我們的空軍，必須增強到牠的軋軋機聲掩沒了半島上一切嘈雜的聲浪，牠的翼子遮暗了無邊的天空。這樣，在一九三五年到一九四〇年之間，歐洲歷史發生悲慘的一幕時，我們便可以使我們的聲音響亮了。我們將使我們的權威獲得世界的公認。但這當然是需要好幾年準備的。」墨索里尼眞是一個偉大而活動的人物。他也是歐洲最坦直的政治家。誠如羅馬一種日報O　ttobre永遠在報頭揭示說：「墨索里尼總是對的。」而現在，我們正是在「一九三五年到一九三六年之間」了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的企圖是在對外征服。個人的野心，個人的驕傲，政治家對於自己的歷史任務的觀念，使他的政策成了形。墨索里尼自以為是現代的凱撒，夢想過一個新的羅馬帝國。羅禹是永遠美麗的城市，墨索里尼在修建羅馬古跡上諜過不少力。我一到羅馬便往偉大的派拉索維尼齊亞去。那是用從古羅馬大戲協（Colosseum）搬來的石料造成的，從前是教皇的私產，現在成為墨索里尼的司令部了。從這兒有一條廣闊的帝國大道，一旁是圖拉眞的牌樓（Forum）和石柱，另一旁是羅馬牌樓，一直通到莊嚴偉大的大戲塲。羅馬牌樓之前有一堵磚牆，這上而墨索里尼嵌了四塊大理石的地圖。第一圖是歐洲非洲上部和近東，用純黑光亮的大理石砌成，海的周圍鑲著綠的條紋，羅烏城則用一圈咖啡色的來表示。是紀元前八世紀羅馬建立之初的情形。第二圖代表紀元前一百四十六年時的羅馬帝國，那咖啡色的一圈推廣開去，包括西斑牙的一半，科西加（Corsica）薩地尼亞，（Sardinia)意大利，伊利里亞海岸—今之南斯拉夫—馬其頓，色雷斯（Thrace）和迦大基城。這是布匿戰爭後的情形。紀元後十四年，如第三圖所示，羅馬統轉著西班牙和法國的全部，德國萊茵河以南，歐洲南部到多腦河為界，君士但丁堡和牠的內地，小亞西亞，西里西亞，安提阿（Antioch）叙利亞，巴力斯坦，埃及南到蘇丹，里比亞，迦太基全攬，以及奴米底亞（Numidia）的一部。圖拉眞（98-117-A．D．）把帝國發展到最高頂點。他的疆界除過去的咖啡色全部以外，還加上了不列顛德意志（遠及波羅的海）巴爾幹（幾乎到了俄羅斯）卡帕多細寫（Cappadocia）亞美尼亞（到裏海的全部）美索不達米亞（下至波斯海灣）以及阿拉伯。墨索里尼當然是在注意那張第四圖。他的羅馬祖先在他們想佔頒向比西尼亞之前征服了英國，現在，墨索里尼卻要把那先例顛倒過來。</p>
<p>理智告訴我們，那磚牆上是沒有餘地可以再容納另一幅的地圖了。但法西斯主義卻仍用盡方法把帝國主義的崇拜心理印進國民的腦中去。『帝國不斷地興亡者交替着」昨天有一個盛氣的法西斯黨人對我說，「難道不列顛」帝國就能、永久的持續下去嗎？』這種論調是到處可以聽到的。五天以前我曾經和羅索尼作過長時問的談話，他大概可算是意大利的第三個人物。他說：「有人以為世界是穩定的，可是歷史的動力卻是不可忽視的啊，我總是信仰帝國主義的。」墨索里尼自己也曾經幾决解釋過這種敎條。在一九二六年，他說：「意大利要求列強承鰓她的陽光和土地的需要，如果她們不承認，意大利只得採取斷然的處置了。」</p>
<p>「非洲和東方妝那就是小亞細亞）是意大利發展的方向，如墨索堅尼在一九三四年三月所說的。他有饗個的「徒弟」，是更來得確定。他們想到阿此西尼亞，那是當然的，還有埃及和印度。意大利人曾竭力想紐織和誘惑印度的留歐學生，那是一件事實。一九三五年十月十二日，阿比西尼亞戰爭開始後九日，羅馬的；Massaggero報說：</p>
<p>意大利在印度的經濟和道穗的立壞上已同時得到非常優越的地位了。全印度已在對統治他們的異族總督的一致憤恨情緒下聯合起來了。印度願向對英國挑戰的國家表示敬意。……英國想煽動有色人種來反對我們顯得是失敗了。印度的大多數民眾是都能明瞭此中利益的，那就是意大利向非洲的推進，正無異於印度的復活……淪為奴隸的印度人正把我們視作最後的一錢希望呢。那傑布汀斯基領導下的猶太法西斯民族主義者竭力主張由意大利代管巴拉斯坦。意大利當局更曾給他們以激勵。意大利曾把目光注視着叙利亞。羅馬想在阿拉伯半島上的葉門得一立足地的企圖，也是大家都知道的事實。這和野心是不會有止境的。</p>
<p>帝國主義幕後的動機是很不一致的，輿論也時常隨養改變。的確，近來有少數學者提出帝國主義不再因經濟原因而產生的論調。因此墨索里尼的政策可說是異常有趣味的問題，如果我們知道法西斯帝國主義的來源和性質—這對於那混亂的世界也許有着很大關係的。</p>

<p>中央大學農學院院長　鯽樹文</p>
<p>我今天所說農村褒落的原因，光專就中國的倩形而言，並艮把我所耍說的分做兩段：　將各雜拙一書報，對於此間題所發表的言論，綜合起來，加以討論；　我個人所見略有不同，亦不得不就這個巡目，發揮幾句。</p>
<p>一，粽合一般首淪所謂農村寰落的原因並討論其鞏要性。</p>
<p>我國從海通以來，餒驚於他國的強鹽，大多數悲眼在都市的進化，完全忽略了農村，近來漸漸鼾得專重都市沒有辦法，於她一變而注意攔興農村，最近雜誌報章關於此類文字，汗牛充楝，所說農村衰落的原因，總結起米，不外下列丰種：</p>
<p>外力的壓迫　還是中國農村衰鮮的主要原因，包括帝國士褻的傻略，苛捐雜稅的榨取，農村受這兩徑外力的願迫，祇有走入褻落的一途了。我們先設帝國主義的侵略：</p>
<p>帝國中義喇最初用武力來壓鈞教國除了割讓土地還粵賠償鉅狄，除了關稅不能自主，還尢許他們在國內設工廠，開銀行，這探政治和經濟的侵略，雙頂齊下，我國每年直接間接所受的損失，何止數萬萬元黠血且一般洋貨，既有最息關稅為護終，又有磯艦政繁為後盾，即可順說而來，長朋直人，茫聚在窮鄉僻壤的地方，最低生沃的日常必辦品，也矯用洋貨了。我們中國原有的手工業，一概都被洋貨打倒，而且農產品價格低祝到生產成本以下，農民們日小而作，日入而息，一年忙忙碌碌，都楚為人作嫁，自己還邢挨凍受蛾。談們把鍍近一很餘年夾海關貿易冊翻開米一看，便知道除液近三年，甲為柬北淪繙，貨價低落，購貿勾絲弱特別原因，進口貨值較前低紼，陰常別論外，自民國允年至二十年，進口貨值都楚逐年增加而無砍的每年金錢流山，圾多竟達二十蝕窩萬元。我們買進的都是抵制我國國貨的洋貨。很少發展本國工業的必需品，所以不但入超的數膩可畏，實際上且有銷減土貨的危險。農村賽落的速度也自然加快了！</p>
<p>其次，設到苛捐雜稅的榨取。繳納捐稅原是人瓦應盡的義務，然而重重墨撚的背捐雜稅，也趁促成農村凌痳的原因，據農村複與委員會調查，閉妣附加稅的客瀉，江鱖有五六十種，浙江有七十餘種，江蘇有一百零五殺之咨；至於超過正稅的數目，江務省有超過二十五倍謝，尚不算多，瀾北省甚至有超過八十飲倍者。險田賦附加之外，還有「預黴」，聰講四川在從前軍閥劉據時代，一年數徽，倣不算一回奇事，普至有些地方微收到民國七十年的錢糧哩！此外尚有類似田賦附加的「器派」，大都也按報緲，咸按正縐從收的，還種鑿派悄形，雖然不如田賦附加那樣普遍，但她在交通不便，政治膿暗，農民知議幼稚的地方，也發一種常見的事悄，而且這種攤派的辦抉，往往比田賦附加還嬰背眾呢！不於各地方的冬種嗷培聞接山農蛹負擔的特別捐稅，一時也詠不完。以農民有限的脂膏，拱苛捐雜稅無窮的榨取，農村怎得不整解呢！現在中央和各地方政府正容限制田賦附加，域免界種胄擴雜稅，巡是一件可喜的事悄，但是以前的傷痰，楚祖難安好的。</p>
<p>農村本的衰弱　我們中國土地分配不均，農村自耕農太少，農家收支不能相紙，以反住席方泌不能改良等，都是農村本身的衰弱症，也是農村衰落的主要原因。</p>
<p>第一，土地分配的不均　據調查結果，我把中國圾大多數的農民，祗佔有極小數的土地，而極小數的地生，反佔有圾多數的田畝，班窮無立錐之地的農民，或有上地而不栘誹瞰的農民，不慮不向地生肌捆，既向地生租佃究自然要緻田和亂其結果鶉得把一年辛苦拼紜听得的至少專送一半到地主的袋裹去，剩下來的尚不夠維持袍們坡低限度的生活。土地分配不均，以致全被豪強襲併，本始歷史上自古以來郵眞饗階趨，私市郎鑿鴃名田王田公田等制度，都謬想解賺這佃問題血朱能遼其崗的。現在此問題允為切要，如何吏阱者啊緒田，廷汨必買討論的了。</p>
<p>第二，農家收支的不相抵　據最近新聞報載，滬郊農村改改　區調查，滬西七十二個村子，共九百四十五戶，四千另四十九人，今年總收人九萬七手九百七十一元五角，總支出十四萬九千九百十八元七分，年虧五寓一千九百四十六元栽角心分，每家平均年虧五十四元九角三分二原，不論男女老幼平均飪人均項魚嘖十二元六角八分八原。這種收支不相抵的現象，不僅滬西如此，其他各地倘若群細調查起米，可以說也他奠不如此的。因為個農生活因難，園然饗借伙過日子，自耕農也因為農產品的價彬低痲，背捐維稅的剝削，以及生活稈度的過高，饒們的生活也她同樣困雞，也他聞檬的要借債中不過日子。</p>
<p>跟藩借債而來的，就是高利貸的剝削，據　聯經濟專家調查報告「高利貸為中國農民目」歡極大的痛苦，因中國農擾貸狄，其利率小鉤已遂百分之三十三，甚至有百分之一百以上者」。燦民的生活既然困雞，州產的齋金肉然她缺乏，不得不價伙以苟越黝哨，即不得不尖高剎貸的剝削以飲鳩止渴，</p>
<p>第三，雖產技初不改良　我們中國的農業原來歟小饜制，不適於大紫的生產，農足的知議淺噸，一切農業技祕，都是　守成援，不煩改良，同時世界簽國農業的進步，一日千里，農喊品的改良，成效朮著，而我們中國的農業，故涉自對，未免相形見細，譬如茶為我們中國農產翁縱口的大宗，在三十年前，輸山額佔全世界第一位，近來霓被鎢蘭·爪哇。印度的茶所打倒，文如舉絲的國際商塲，亦被日本。義大利的絲所佔據，甚至國內主要的食糧——米麥，也要　洋米麥來接濟。</p>
<p>總之，因土地分配不平對，不能不受地卞的掠奪；因收支不樅抵，不能不受高利貸的槃剝；因生產技撕不改民，不能不受國際農產品戲拙斥；這即是　，農村三身戲虛弱，其親男自然不能不褻解。</p>
<p>天災人禍的影饗　我國農村的痠落，受天災人禍的影響也楚很大，例如民國二十年的外鑿，規徐颼忿災勃灘會鱸朴告：十年夏秋之交，有人口二千九百萬，地而七萬方英黑，遭受空前的大水災，災區損失農作物丸萬萬尢，羲體攝失二千萬萬元。又據農韌所轂足國黑十三年的災情，旱災有二十省二百二十縣，水災有一三十省一百十丸縣，蝗災有八省二十　縣，其他攝孵有十三賓七十六縣，病害有六省二十七縣，風災有十叫省四十六縣，雹災有十省叫十阿縣，霜審有六賓二十縣，鑾紼有　賓二縣，統計損失在十五萬元以上。又據全國水災救　會的報告：去年（二十四年）水災以腳：長江流城受災地面七千四百二十萬畝，遭幹人民十千的首萬人，財寄損扔二萬二千六百萬元；資河流域受災取面八千零叫四十二萬九千二百十九以，遭狀人民九百萬人，財席攝失二萬一千八百二十五萵元，總州長往黃河兩决流城受災地面一萬五千叫百七十三萬九千三百十九畝，遭無人民一千九百萬人，財產損失五萬叫千四百　十五窩儿。以上所說，不過鎚近幾年遭受火災的大搬悄形，我們中國非不多沒有一年沒有一省不受天災的，直接的損失固然很大，種種間接的損失更難統計了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>（本報記者旅行通信）　記淥河大橋</p>
<p>余儕於四日晨離長沙至株州，所乘之車為長沙株萍段，亦為湘鄂路局所管轄。此路原僅株州至萍鄉一段，係商入所辦，嗣收歸國有，復由株州接至長沙，為萍鄉運煤之唯一孔道。余儕所乘之客車，乃一運貨之木棚車所改造而成者，敝陋污穢，不堪想豫，但此係唯一之客車，捨此將無車可坐矣。車行後，兩旁所見者，都為市肆，若理髮店，若茶館，若小飯舖，應有儘有，驟觀之，幾疑坐火車在弄堂中行駛，甚為可笑，直至長沙市郊以外，方出弄堂，向曠野中行去。至車中情形，與鈸揚小輪相仿，小販呌囂，出售各種食品，亦色色俱備，所缺者，唯無女子度曲耳。聞同車某君言：此車行駛甚緩，揩油乘車者，可一躍而上，及查票員至，又可一躍而下，尙有膽大者，竟攀車底，附載以行，蓋車底輪軸間裝有鐵桿，人坐桿上，毫無畏懼，如有失手而輾斃者，人且斥為無用。噫！亦太可憐矣。長沙多雨，此車行時，旅客必備雨傘，因車頂已漏，大雨傾盆時，或且淋漓滿身也。某君之言如此，余聞之不禁失笑。</p>
<p>午後一時許車抵株州。株州為一小鎮，屬於湘潭，為粵漢路株韶段之起點，將來京湘路告成時，此鎮允為衝要，惟以距長沙密邇，商業方面，似無發展之期望耳。下車後，卽赴株韶工程局第七總段第二分段辦事處稍憇，其地為一祠堂，房屋寬敞，在此荒僻之區，極不易得，四週小山重疊，門前碧水縈迥，風景至為不惡。工稈司金士耋君，車務段段長謝岳君，在此工作，已歷時二年有餘，生活甚為枯寂，余笑謂二君，株韶段通車在卽，大功告成精神上之愉快，當可抵償生活上之枯寂矣。在株州停二小時，換乘株韶局工程車至淥口，參觀淥河大橋，中途過第七總段段長吳思遠君之家，卽於門前用扶梯自車上爬下，如此落車，生平尙為第一决。在吳君家休息半小時，卽用手搖車馳赴淥河之濱。查粵漢路株韶局最艱鉅之工稈為橋與洞，南段多洞，（南段亦有五大拱橋工程）北段多橋。橋之工程，以　淥河　洣河　耒河三者施工較難。淥·洣·耒·三河均湘江支流，係鐵路必經之道。余儕登手搖車後，工人四名，駕車如飛，天寒風勁，冷不可言，甚覺苦楚，繼念此路員工如此艱辛，余倖得來觀，尙何畏怯，精神乃為之一振。車行的二十分鐘，已抵淥河之濱，巍峨大橋，亦呈露於眼前。下車後渡河至南岸，由吳段長前導，經行若干木架，至第十孔橋墩參觀，此孔為斯橋最後工程，有工人甚多，方澆士敏土於墩內，情景至為緊張，余儕所立之地，已在河面之下，蓋澆製橋</p>
<p>淥河大橋墩，必先打壩，隔斷水流。吾儕旣立壩內，故在河面之下也。淥河河面，南北兩岸，計闊三百公尺，水位最小時深僅三公尺，最高時竟漲至十八公尺。至綠河橋之長度，凡三百四十四公尺，高二十一公尺，（自橋基至橋墩頂）橋台二座，（卽橋之兩端）橋墩十座，凡十一孔，鈑樑者七孔，每孔十八公尺，桁樑者四孔，每孔五十五公尺。每年春末夏初，的在四五月間，為淥河漲水時間，此際雨量極多，兼之山洪暴發，往往溢至兩岸，橋樑施工，特別困難。二十三年水患更鉅，大小發水，凡二十餘次，往往一夜之間，漲水七八尺，令入無從預測，故今日所施之工，翌晨已被冲洗凈盡，江水滔滔，惟有向其太息而已。兼之打壩所用之椿，為經濟所限，多用木板榕，鋼板椿僅有少許，且係向首都長江輪渡工程所購來之舊貨，在二十三年秋季，甫將鋼板椿兩面打好，忽遭大水亦全被冲倒，於是全功盡棄，祇得再度施工，此該橋施工之大槪困難情形也。吳段長云，此橋歷盡艱辛，一言難盡，現在日夜開工，橋墩工程，再有四日，卽可完畢，至於架橘敷軌，需時甚暫，大的至四月初，卽可自株州直接過橋通車前進矣。至沬河橋早已完工，耒河橋，將於四月初告竣，故全綫於五月底通車實不成問題也。又淥橋之墩台工程，係董子紀承造，架橋工程，係上海新中公司承造。余儕在橋畔參觀甚久，天已入夜復坐手搖車至第七總段辦事室休息，一日奔波，至此告一段落。膳後在煤油燈下記此，已至午夜。明晨仍乘株韶局工程車向衡山進發。（三月四日深夜在淥口）</p>

<p>市長演說</p>
<p>會長致詞畢、即由吳市長起而演說、略謂、本人今日得參加此盛大典禮、甚為榮幸、同時我覺得在諸位女士前、要說的幾句話、就是我們中國之革命運動、已有五六十年之歷史、而五六十年來、為什麼新中國的建設運動、不能澈底的成功呢、因為有一個很大的障礙物、尚未除去、這障礙物就是迷信、因為有了迷信、國人就不能從事革命、從事建設、什麼事都靠命運來支配、所以我們要求民族的復興、非剷除障礙物的迷信不可、中國人是迷信的、但是最迷信的要算是婦女、現在的新會址、是大家知道為最不利的房屋、但是俗語云、人傑地靈、實在是人好地好、人壞地壞、所以這次遷移、不僅是擴充會務、主要的是打破中國新運的建設的障礙，就是破除迷信、中國在五六十年前、中山先生就提倡男女平權、我以為婦女要達到平權、達到解放、是很艱難的、但是要使我國民族復興的成功、不能不使婦女解放成功、不能不使中國婦女增進能力、但是要達到平權和解放、先要使婦女在社會上有地位有能力的修養、眞正能力和知識、並不限於學校所造成的、在社會上得着的也不少、有學識的婦女、要能創造社會的事業、有知識而不勞動的婦女、應當要負起這種責任、耍曉得婦女的責任、是很重大、負有復興民族的使命、要依着歷史的賢妻良母之規範、來求民族的復興和國家的强盛、我以為要求有知識有時間的婦女、出來幹普及教育等的社會事業、使無能力無知識的婦女、亦使他變為有能力有知識、這是婦女解放運動中、不可少的一個過程、請各位要加倍的努力、歷史上的賢妻良母、是婦女的主權、我以為對於賢妻良母的解釋、僅僅為家庭、迄是太狹義了、要知道婦女解放的目的、為達到男女平權、要求民族的復興、而民族復興如何會成功呢、必要養成許多的賢妻良母、對象不僅是家庭、我們要廣義的解釋、譬如戰國時的孟母教子、宋朝的岳母教子、並不僅限於家庭、耍推廣到整個民族的復興、婦女本身的責任、就是賢妻良母、最好大家要模倣岳飛和孟子的母親、來訓導我們的小國民、從前的賢妻良母很少、現在我希望全國婦女、都要變成賢妻良母、那末國家能復興、民族能生存、關於婦女解放運動最重要的、他本身要利用他對於國家的責任、因為男子和女子、都有救國的責任、我以為男子的資任是現在的、而女子的責任都是將來的、將來的責任是什麼、中國的生命就是操在他手裹、將來的資任很偉大、使我們的民族、永遠的存在、救國不僅是男子、女子的責任、簡直執中國未來生命存亡的關鍵、所以我要勸婦女們、要破除迷信、要做賢妻良母、要求男女平權、要服務社會事業、女靑年會是婦女解放運動的領袖團體、是婦女為社會服務的實行者、請諸位加倍努力、所以道决女靑年會的遷移、其意義眞是很深長呢、</p>

<h3 id="c149">葡萄牙二比三失敗　中華隊保持萬過盃　葡隊要員柯拉沙鼓斯坦均缺席中華隊之勝利乃成當然之局面 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>本屆上海萬國足球錦標、又為中華奪得矣、昨與葡萄牙决賽於逸園、觀衆達八九千人、葡萄牙兩負大將柯拉沙與谷斯坦均未出塲、縱使雷米狄重作馮嫦、出任堅拒、顧不能撼中華之錄芒、動搖錦標也、一般人見葡隊陣容單薄、未待上陣交鋒、已預料中華穩操勝券、比賽結果、中華果以三比、一完成覇業、回憶去年决賽、亦為中葡兩隊、結果中華亦以三比二勝、可謂無獨有偶、本季葡隊之目信力甚强、滿擬染指錦標、隨其願望、不料賽期旣屆、主要選手如柯拉沙谷斯坦輩、因傷不堪出塲、功敗垂成、長使英雄淚滿襟矣、</p>
<p>葡萄牙聯絡可歡</p>
<p>葡隊起用新進球員、起首努力奮鬥、聲勢極盛、卒以經騐不足、入復漸漸軟化、未能保持其首開紀錄之光榮、全隊聯絡尚佳、但脚頭欠强、多用小傳遞進攻重心、全在中路、兩翼殊少活動、亦無可取、故欲圖攻破中華防綫、誠難乎其難矣、守門者能運用正確之判斷力、應付來球、救出險球不少、電米狄為防禦綫之靈魂、態度嫻靜、在中華前鋒猛烈之烽火下、從容應付、厥功殊偉、餘子亦均克盡厥職、始終不懈、</p>
<p>中華隊聲勢不通</p>
<p>中華隊之獲勝、自為必然之勢、但表演並無特色之處、前鋒時陷於慌亂形態况中、不能互相呼應、前後隔碍、主守不能助攻、於是前鋒勢力孤單、下半時孫錦順從中調濟、形勢為之一變、全隊因聯絡之不任、使各個均未能盡量發揮其藝術、以敵軍前鋒力量之薄弱、不易深入險地、三比二之結果、實不能證明局情之緊張也、</p>
<p>岡賽夫首開紀錄</p>
<p>佈陣交鋒、葡萄牙一鼓作氣、向中華陣地猛力攻打、銳氣極盛、江善敬三决救援、保住汀山、陳鎮和邊陲發難、雷米狄以逸待勞、不慌不忙、奪球而出、義臣中路進取、挑球前方、鍾勇森竄前捉球、被葡守門捷足先登、救之而出、中華幾度猛攻、均被雷米狄以穩健之步武、化險為夷、葡軍得機進攻、由中路殺進、以其傳遞之得法、直達中華門前、頓成緊張形勢、中華偶一疏忽、葡左內鋒岡賽夫偷空射門、首開紀錄、距開賽僅十分鐘耳、</p>
<p>孫錦順頂上開花</p>
<p>勝負旣分、觀眾情緒為之激烈、中華以進攻不利、反遭敵隊之算、說氣激發、力圖收　　地、左路兵馬、摧動全局之輸、向前邁進、孫錦順最先發脚、猛力放砲、敵隊守門為之一驚、不幸球彈門柱而回、義臣策馬加鞭、繼續攻城、雖中而越位、斯時中華聲勢極盛、但敵壘森嚴、不得其門而入、二十五分鐘後、陳鎮和帶球盤進、至罰球錢邊、敵人搶球被罰、顧當勷主踢、落點甚佳、守鬥衝出拍球、老孫迎之以頭、頂上開花、造成和局、</p>
<p>李義臣亦中一球</p>
<p>此后雙方又再相持不下中、你來我往、均無機會、出勢又漸趨沉悶、中華前後阻隔、聲氣不通、葡萄牙之短傅　、亦失去功效、兩翼脚頭軟弱、毫無進展、四十二分鐘時、義臣又中一球、中華乃反敗為勝、激發葡隊反攻之决心、猛撲中華要塞、得角球機會、正待踢出、上半時即行終了、休息後、易門再戰、中華聯絡上有顯著之進步、而葡萄牙抱决心以抗爭、球勢遂常於刺激性、</p>
<p>十二碼奠定大局</p>
<p>葡萄牙仍抱先發制人之戰略、向中華進攻、前鋒與守衛、呼成一氣、能　景活動、中華豈肯示弱、老孫前後接濟、使聯絡上得到相當成功、雙方均失郤機食甚多、十分鐘時、賈幼良在角球地位、傳球敵隊門前、脚頭甚準、義臣猛射、球觸岡賽夫之手、判罰十二碼球、孫錦順主踢、將球送入鬥角、對手無從挽救、中華遂以三比一佔極端優勢、大局從此奠定、</p>
<p>維克多暗放冷箭</p>
<p>陳鎮和賴其　碩之體格、衝刺甚快、屢决興風作浪、使敵軍陷於不安、勇森幼良、似尚有少許隔碍、不能收相得益彰之妙、但總而言之、中華　站在最優之戰綫上、使葡萄牙不遑招架、乏力進攻、惜攻門機會甚少、鎮和義臣錦順復屢决發射高球、使紀錄未能再增、相持達半小時之久、葡隊忽脫穎而出、出其不意、維克多暗放冷箭、張榮才視綫被阻、球在其身上彈人門內、無意間失去一球、結果遂成三比二、</p>

<p>一决特別提早的輕鬆的晚餐，接蒲又來一陣拭髪和洗手：然後這一班人都急切盼望着客人的到臨。然而也只有近親是被邀請的；因為這些小小的作樂純粹是家庭式的。後來大家都來了；馬先生和馬夫人，司了了梅格母，他雖然穿了件喪報，並且　了一頁小小的寡婦帽圍着她安靜的　兒，然而還依然是那麽婉的而可愛。坦第姨丈和艾美姨母，同了他們的女公子，她現在更。得有如仙子一般，穿上一件天靑的衣服，帶着一大球的果花，這些花她就分與各個童子，插在他們衣上的鈕扣窩裹，使得他們覺得特別精微而且華美。只有一個陌生的臉兒出現，坦第姨領着這個不知姓名的人到裴氏夫婦之前，說道：</p>
<p>「這是哈德是生：他是在打牌聽唐恩；我就大膽領了他來，他可以看到這孩子進步多少了。」</p>
<p>裴氏夫婦招，他很有　意，為了　恩之故，日到還有人記得這個孩子，心裹自是歡喜的。不過經過幾分　談話之後，他們却對於哈生自己，有相見恨晚的感想，因為他們發現他是那麽暢快，率眞　有趣的一個人。當那竄子一見他的朋友臉上發出光來，已是一件愉快的事：更　愉快的是見到啥先生的警喜當他看到了唐恩外觀和禮貌上的進步；不過最愉快的是看見兩個人坐在房間的一角，深深談着在他們的倆共感興趣的題目上，比較他們的所見，又各訴述他們夏季裹戶外的生活，忘了他們年紀修養和地位的不同了。</p>

<h3 id="c168">我們的主張 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 金光楣</p>
<p>在國難日益嚴重，帝國主義的敵人對華侵略加緊進行的目前，三八勞働婦女解放節的紀念，使我們感覺到我們中國的婦女界所肩荷的責任之益為重大，故共紀念的意義也益為深長！</p>
<p>我們很淸楚很明白目前的中國婦女界要求有眞正的解放，要獲得有眞正的自由，獨立和平等，必須要改造目前的這種社會經濟制度，允其首先耍爭取我們的民族解放運動的成功！</p>
<p>我們的國家目前所處的地位，我們的民族目前所處的環境，較諸其他的一切資本主義國家和一切的殖民地都不同，我們的國家是一個次殖民地的國家，我們的民族是處於白色的赤色的各帝國主義者的侵吞和壓迫之下，因之，我們所負荷的責任，也較其他的一切國家的婦女們要來得更為重大！</p>
<p>所以我們認為我們目前的急務！應該是以反帝國主義和反封建餘孽的積極行動為手叚，以爭取我們民族解放運動的完全勝利，把中國從危難的次殖民地的地位中拯救出來，從而改造目前的這種社會經濟制度，而達到我們婦女界的自身之完全解放和獨立平等。</p>
<p>我們為了三八婦女節對於我們這個處於非常時期中的中國婦女們的意義之深長和重大，所以我們在紀念之餘，决意對於這次三八節放棄一切的紀念形式，而只是深深地念着我們的責任之重大，把握着我們的信心，切實地去執行我們的工作路綫！</p>
<h3 id="c169">紀念三八節的意義 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡金瑛</p>
<p>三八節至今已有二十餘年的歷史，我國自北伐以後，我們才認識了它的意義：因之，每年到了此日，各地集會慶祝，但當這內憂外患，國勢危急的辰光！來紀念這個三八節，我們瞻前顧後，自然有許多的感慨！</p>
<p>我們慶祝它就是追念已往的功績，把握現在的途徑，努力創造將來的事業。所以我們在這集會慶祝興高彩烈的時候，我們的內心固懷着滿腔慹忱，期待大衆去謀女子的幸福。我們紀念它决不是開會演說，我們瞧該認淸楚我們的四周圍，觀察婦女命運的前途，我們應該對於水深火慹中的婦女，依然未解放的一婦女，從這個三八節以後，予以新的力一量，新的刺激，去為她們找一條光明的一出路，這才是我們紀念三八節的意義。</p>

<h3 id="c171">救亡運動中的婦女 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 閻振玉</p>
<p>——為三八婦女節作——</p>
<p>一九三六年。這一個危機四伏一觸即發的非常時期，中國的婦女們，不，全世界被壓迫的婦女們已經走到生死存亡垂續的階段了。擺在面前的，顯然的只有兩條路可走：一是為生存而抗戰；一是為奴隸而屈服。何去何從，這是用不到我來細說，凡有知覺的婦女們誰都能够自主决擇的。所以，我以為處在這暴風雨前夜的中國底婦女們，臨到什麼紀念會的日子决不是一回宣言，喊幾句口號所能濟事的。我們應該認淸目標，巢中力量，為民族生存而抗戰，為全世界被壓迫的婦女們爭取自由平等而流血。只有這樣，才是我們正當的出路，才是我們目前刻不容緩的工作。才是我們不可推卸的任務。</p>
<p>誰都知道，目前世界的大勢，很顯明的形成壓迫者與被壓迫者的兩大壁壘。壓迫的帝國主義者，因為生產過剩，經濟漸漸集中到資本家的手裹，牠們不得不設法向外發展，擴充牠們的殖民地來作為吸收經濟的來源，以穩固牠們目身的基礎。因此帝國主義者不惜把　大的金錢來擴充軍備，積極向外發展牠們的殖民地以减輕牠們國內的危機。一方面想利用對外作戰的光榮琮欺騙民衆，麻醉民衆，驅使民衆上戰場去送死。這是目前世界資本帝國主義者所不可吾認的事實。而被壓迫者的弱小民族呢，牠們鑒於國土之淪亡，懍於國民經濟之日益枯竭，謀生托足之不易支持，自然而然的聯成一致的戰錢，向壓迫者作殊死的反攻。</p>
<p>世界旣是一個不安定的世界，中國是世界的一部份，當然也不能例外。何况目前中國受了强敵的壓迫已是到了忍無可忍的時期了。我們如果願意生存的話。那必然的路綫是「抗戰」。如其甘心準備做奴隸的話，那必然的路綫是「屈服」。不過，我以為除去全無血氣的人而外，絕無一人願看數千年歷史的地大物博的中國給强敵刦取而不救，更沒有人忍看我們的同胞被人宰割而不助。我們處在這民族存亡垂絕的關頭，大家應明白「皮之不存，毛將安附」的古訓，大家一致的站在抗敵的旗幟之下與侵略者作一個你死我活的戰門。所以，救亡運動，而是目前全國民衆刻不容緩的工作，也就是全國民衆渴求生存的工作。然而救國的方策多端，倘沒有一致的目標與路綫，是容易陷入分岐和不統的路上去的。我們應該站在政府抗敵的指揮之下，與强敵作繼續不斷的鬥爭。務達到民族解放的目的才止。</p>
<p>話雖這麽說，中國婦女們的知識與男子們相較，到底是不及男子來得普遍的，許多男子所能做的工作，女子因為知識與體格的關係，是不能跟男子相提並論的。因此，我以為今後的中國的婦女界對於救亡運動應該銀鍊健全的體格與革除懦弱的習氣。我們知道中國在世界上最恥辱的雅號是「東亞病夫」的稱呼，這雖然是指整個的中國而言，然而女子的體格的不健全與懦弱的人數，是確乎超出男子之上的。我們要救中國，第一要緊是鍛鍊體格。假使體不健全，一切的方法與主張，也是徒然的。</p>
<p>再則，我以為女子應先斷然的摒除奢侈的裝飾，近年來天天喊農村經濟破產，國民經濟崩潰，然而據每年來海關進口貨的報告，婦女裝飾品的消耗，其數目幾乎無年不在增加。這一個巨大的利源的外溢，一面可使國家經濟日益枯竭，一面可以看出女子日趨於奢侈之一途，這是我們婦女界的同胞們所不可漢視的。因為非常時期的來臨，全國的婦女們實在不需要這一類的消耗品的。</p>
<p>更其緊要的，在此時期中，全國的婦女應有戰時的準備與普遍救護的組織。假使事前沒有相當的準備，不但不能作政府的後盾，反而因戰爭的恐嚇輾轉遷避，更足影響抗敵的工作。所以我以為在戰爭以前，婦女們應有戰時的準備與普遍的救護組織，一方面可以鞏固後方的民心，他方面於戰事上有實質的帮助。而且在婦女的本身，擔任這樣的工作是頗覺適宜的。共他關於婦女們應負的責任固然是很多，同時，非常時期的來臨婦女們的工作，當然也絕對沒有這麽簡單，這裹，限於篇幅，不能詳細叙述了。</p>
<p>總之，我以為處在强鄰逼境的中國的婦女們，無疑地祇有抗爭才是我們眞正的出路。</p>
<h3 id="c172">三八節漫談 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙若女士</p>
<p>三八節是勞動婦女求「麵包與和平」的紀念節，我國中上階級的婦女，對於「勞動」二字，實有愧色，因為她們飽食終日，無所事事。我想世界各國最享福最懶惰的婦女，沒有再超過中國中上之家的婦女了！她們在家靠父，出嫁靠夫，夫死從子，優遊終日，無憂無慮，她們不知天怎樣高？地怎樣厚？不懂社會的情形；世界的大勢；父兄掙錢的苦惱，她們只知道伸手向父或夫拿錢，來研究服裝的華麗，爭奇鬥一勝之外，便是爭風吃醋，這樣子消磨她們的一一生。一半也因為中國勞工的過剩，所以上中之家都是婢僕成羣，至少也有一個老媽子供使喚。所以這班主婦，除脅肩　笑，爭得丈夫寵悅外，便是生兒育女為她們的莫大功勞，但是她們只會生，不會養，因為兒女一出世，便拿他們交給乳媽，以後兒女的飲食冷暖，和身體的强健衰弱，怎樣使兒童受良好的教育，她們一些都不打算，一點都不關心，什麼事都不問不聞，完全交給婢僕，她們只知道呼朋引類，看戲打牌，再探聽丈夫有沒有外遇？走進她們的家，只見弄得一塌糊塗，烏烟瘴氣，不象一個家庭！</p>
<p>所以我不禁為一般中國男子叫屈，他們一生一世，為妻子兒女做牛馬，回到家裹，何嘗享到一些家庭的樂趣呢？</p>
<p>然而中國男子不必可憐他們，他們是自願做牛馬，他們拿「女子無才便是德」，或「女子回到家庭去」當作工具，不使女子與男子受同等的教育，來束縛婦女，覊糾婦女，使婦女成茫茫無知的笨東西，成為男子的玩物。他們以為知識婦女到社會上服務，是奪去男子的地位，搶掉男子的飯碗（他們不知道失業人數為什麽增加的原因）所以要趕婦女回家庭。你想中國勞工這樣不値錢，四五元一個月工錢，就能牛馬般一天做到晚。一般太太奶奶們，何等的聰明，誰願省四五元錢一個月而自己胼手胝足地去勞作呢，她們完全拿家事交給婢僕，自己享享淸福。但靜極思動，人之常情，一般男子旣不願她們到社會上去服務，於是她們也樂得便宜，專門往吃，喝，穿，玩，上去用功夫了，到了結末，豈不是仍舊男子們自找苦吃？</p>
<p>然而我要奉勸諸姑姊妹們，請你們不要自暴自棄，看看淸楚，現在中國已處於危急存亡的關頭了，古語說：「天下興亡，匹夫有責，」男女旣屬平等，那末匹婦也當努力做人，應該肩起一半責兒。有學問有能力的婦女，應該使出來供獻給社會，如學識差些或有幼小的兒女，不能離開家庭，那末處理家政，必勤必儉，相夫教子，如有餘力，再從事研究高深的學問，來振興中國衰敗的社會。</p>
<p>要知道一家的興敗，只須看這家主婦勤儉與吾。那末考察一國的興亡，豈不是也要看這國內的婦女智識能力的高低，和勤勞與吾。我一中國婦女，處於現在國難當頭的時期，快醒醒一吧，不要再醉生夢死了！</p>

<p>— 靑島市城路小學王建明</p>
<p>做人是最大的問題，做怎樣的人，又是最難解决的問題；這樣重大的問題，就是父母和師長恐怕也沒有方法來替我解决；那麼我自己的問題，還是我自己解决罷！</p>
<p>險惡的潮流，如洶濤怒浪般的狂奔著，一般無知識的靑年們，整天糊裏糊塗，不分東西，不辨黑白的隨波逐浪，以致墮落於汪洋無際的苦海中的，整千整萬，這都是：無主張，無計畫，無目的，只圖目前，不顧將來，所以日暮途窮，終歸失敗！</p>
<p>據現在的潮流，度將來的趨勢，恐怕江河日下，挽回不易。可是社會的改革，無論誰都不得辭其責任，現在的社會，惡劣到極點，商沒有不奸的，紳沒有不劣的，一般靑年，沒有不腐化惡化的，我的主張是：不能挽旣倒的狂瀾，亦當做中流之砥柱，决不能同流合汚，與世浮沉，變成了腐化惡化的份子。</p>
<p>我願立志檢約，廉潔，勇敢，耐勞，經商不販洋貨，當兵不怕流血，作工不辭勞苦，這是我將來做人的最高原則，照這樣做下去，就是不能改良社會，亦絕不至染了社會的惡習，蹈了一般靑年們的覆轍。</p>
<h3 id="c193">兩個模範生 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>我同居的甲乙兩家，各有一兒在這裏的中心小學讀書，都是好學生，所以都被校中選做模範生，他們被選的資格，是因：　學業好，　品行好，　身體好，　服務勤，　助人，　活潑，　儉樸，　淸潔，十一二歲的孩子，就能具有這八種好處，模範生三字自當之無愧了。</p>
<p>兒子在校裏做模範生，父母應該十分喜歡了。可是不。甲兒的母親和我說：我兒愛吃好東西，粗茶淡飯下不得口，一餐沒有肉，便要拋碗擲筷，賭氣挨餓。所說儉樸，不只是穿衣不求美，粗劣飯菜也要能吃，安心於布衣菜飯，才是眞儉樸。他的服務也不勤，在家什麼不肯做，呌他掃一回地，揩一回桌，終是勉勉强强，一副不高興樣子。八項資格中兩項名不符實，怎可做模範生？</p>
<p>乙兒的父親也說：我兒的品行那裏算好？在校裏不敢說，不敢動，十分拘束，看來是個規矩學生，實在是個木頭人。因此活潑兩字也談不到了，見了生客，臉就紅起來，不敢向他看一眼，談一語，並膽小得一人不大敢出門，這種孩子，那裏可稱模範生呢？</p>
<p>我對於他們父母之言，都十分表同情。試問像甲兒的不能吃苦耐勞，就是有了好的學問，將來又何能立脚於社會呢？乙兒的只知靜，不知動，在應動時不動，應說時不說，這樣大起來，毫無說話幹事的能力，又能做什么呢？現在的小朋友，很多怕吃苦耐勞，很多以沈靜不動爲好品行，所以我記下這事，請大家檢查一下自己，是否這樣？</p>

<p>— 葇蘿</p>
<p>大腦有個血統關系的子孫，名字呌做小腦。它住的家和大腦很近，從大腦家裏出來，經過一頂橋——腦橋，便到小腦的家裏了。所以很能夠互相照應。</p>
<p>小腦的年紀很輕，而且性格頗和魚類的——側綫系統——接近，因此他沒有大腦那樣聰明能幹；雖然他大腦分居出來另立門戶。可是他不能智慧地創立新的事業，僅僅乎只能夠使我們人體平衡，穩固，和調節肌肉。</p>
<p>然而，他的志向很向上，明知自己沒有創造能力，他便隨時隨地盡心學習，模仿他的祖宗——大腦的一舉一動。但是，終竟因爲他太年稚，雖然有許多地方模仿的很可以，但他總不敢越權去掠奪大腦的正經工作。在白天，在大腦面前，至多只敢參加一點意見；到了晚上，我們睡覺，大腦休息的時候，他這才放出來代表大腦料理一些瑣務。這種工作，在夏天最容易看出來：</p>
<p>譬如像：一個蚊蟲在叮我們什麼地方了，當地的感覺神經照例是打電報去報告中樞腦神經，但是大腦這時候休息了，接這個電報的便是小腦。他接到這個電報之後，就代表大腦立刻命令運動神經說：「趕快去把蚊蟲拍掉」。我們的手便無意識地把蚊蟲撲殺，我們的大腦還不知道哩。</p>
<p>不過，他的年紀終歸太小，孩子氣太深，在有意無意之間往往和我們開玩笑。而小朋友們最容易上他當。舉個例說：夜間睡著尿急了，小腦接到這種報告無法處置，便給你來一個夢：恍恍忽忽跑到日間常常小便的地方，便痛快淋漓的小溲一番；及一醒來，才知道原來「痛快淋漓」還在床上。這便是小朋友們遺尿的形成的原因。</p>
<p>次之是財迷，夢中淸淸楚楚撿到許多洋錢鈔票，醒來還是兩手空空！</p>
<p>這都是小腦給我們開的玩笑！</p>

<p>說起巴拿馬共和國，也可以稱爲弱小民族罷。它本來不是一個國家，不過是可倫比亞國的一州罷了。後來因爲美國人要得到巴拿馬運河權，所以幫助它獨立。接著又用一千萬美金，買了運河兩岸各五哩的地方，和巴拿馬　的幾個島，設了軍備，派了兵守著，巴拿馬共和國就差不多是美國的保護國了。</p>
<p>形狹長像丁字</p>
<p>巴拿馬共和國北面靠著加勒比安海，南面靠著太平洋。是中亞美利加最狹長的國度。我們看看它的地形，是不是像個「丁」字？（側看）海岸屈屈曲曲，港　很多。</p>
<p>人種非常復雜</p>
<p>全國的人口有四十四萬，人種很復雜，有西班牙人，印第安人，黑人，美國人，和少數的歐洲人，我們中國人也不少。本圖上的女孩，就是印第安人，她的裝束怪異，鼻子上還帶著銀圈呢。</p>
<p>地近赤道天氣熱</p>
<p>巴拿馬共和國近著赤道，天氣很熱。內地多山。全國森林很多。主要的物產是香蕉·朱古力·橡皮·桃花心木·珍珠和龜壳。</p>
<p>過去驚人的歷史</p>
<p>巴拿馬共和國的過去歷史，是驚人的。在十七世紀時候，這地方是探險家們和海盜們縱橫呼嘯的所在。在現代式都市的後面，包圍於森林之中，還遺留著殘破的古屋，那就是二百多年前被海盜們毀壞的。</p>
<p>極易認識的國旗</p>
<p>巴拿馬共和國的國旗是極容易認識的。全面分爲四部份。四分之一是紅色；四分之一是綠色；綠色方形上面是一方白地，上有一顆綠星；紅色方形下面也是一方白地，上有一顆紅星。</p>

<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>花的色彩有種種不同，大槪總是非常悅目。當春神到了之後，大地上的花卉都一齊爭姸　艷，我們看見這樣的景色，無不歡喜讚歎，以爲遺化的造成這些美麗的花朶給人類欣賞，人類可謂幸福之極，造物也可算思深濃厚了。但是，倘若我們仔細一加研究，便知道所有花朶的顏色完全不是爲我們人類而設的。它們的爭姸　艷的對象只不過是昆蟲而已。</p>
<p>假如世界上沒有了昆蟲這樣東西，則所有的花朶將不復再有什麼色彩，這個世界雖存艷陽天氣亦將默然無色了。</p>
<p>植物需要昆蟲做媒介它們的花粉才能繁殖。我們的老話說的「蜂媒蝶使」這句話，用在自然界的這個情狀之下是很適合的。植物因爲昆蟲來幫忙傳播花粉，其情形與商人之想推銷他們的貨品無異，所以它們也像商人一樣，要利用廣吿。每一朶花的鮮艷的花瓣都不　向昆蟲們大聲地訴說此處有鮮美的甜液或豐富的花粉　供採取。</p>
<p>昆蟲的種類很多，它們的胃口也各各不同，所以每種不同的花色都是表示一種特殊的貨料。凡是需要蜜蜂來傳播其花粉的，其花色特別是紫色或藍紫的。</p>
<p>黃的和紅的對於蜜蜂很少或甚至於沒有招惹力。由最近的試驗知道蜜蜂對於紅色是色盲的：它們看見紅色是發黑的，像我們看見照相的底片一樣。可是我們人眼所看不見而只是照相的感光片所能感受到的紫外光綫，蜜蜂却能看見。</p>
<p>蜜蜂有時也會去採我們稱爲紅色的花朶，不過這種花朶常是有其他的色　混合在裏頭而不是單純的紅色。</p>
<p>在熱帶產生的純紅色的花是由鳥類爲其傳播花粉的。</p>
<p>蝴蝶對於許多色彩鮮艷的花朶都會採取。夜飛的蛾類則專採白色和淺色的花。</p>

<p>在上星期日，福岳手裏拿著的凸透鏡，正在玩弄著。爸爸一邊看報，一邊說：「福岳你在弄什麼？」福岳說：「我弄一塊玻璃。」爸爸又道：「這不呌玻璃，你可曉得嗎？」福岳略想了一想說：「這是凸透鏡呀！」小朋友！你們可知道凸透鏡名字嗎？就因爲福岳的爸爸是一位小學校裏敎自然科的敎員，所以凸透鏡三字，早印在福岳的小腦上了。</p>
<p>福岳的爸爸一邊放了報，一邊笑道：：「你要看我出戲法嗎？」福岳笑嘻嘻說：「你變什麼戲法呢？」爸爸走到福岳身邊說：「就拿你手裏的凸透鏡，來變戲法。」福岳就將凸透鏡給爸爸。爸爸手裏拿了凸透鏡，一邊走到太陽中，一邊說：「福岳你替我拿根紙吹來。」一會兒，爸爸把凸透鏡放在太陽裏，在這透鏡的後方，就有一個極明亮的一點，右手把紙吹放在這一點上，一瞬間，就看見一縷縷的烟漸漸地昇上來，接著紙吹就著火而燒起來了。福岳詫異道「咦！咦！眞希奇了，怎樣會燒呢？」爸爸微笑道：「這是你曉得了，因爲太陽光是平行的前進，凸透鏡有一個作用，凡此光綫經過，就在透鏡後方集中一點，這一點物理學上呌做「焦點。」——也是太陽的一個倒像，——所以這點熱度最高，紙吹自然容易燃燒了。將來在物理學上，你可以詳細明瞭不必我再講了。」</p>

<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，算學是甚麼東西？簡單地說，算學是研究科學的基礎工夫。平常你們在學校裏頂　痛苦和不快樂的功課，我可以確定是算學，是嗎？</p>
<p>其實，算學並不難，如果你肯好好用功，懂得所讀的，記得所懂的，寫得所記的；那末你對於算學一定較其他各科來得有趣味。</p>
<p>學習算學，第一該讀熟定理定義，把不明白的地方用紅色　筆記出來，問先生，必定得到澈底了解才是。</p>
<p>其次要多做習題，因爲演習題是幫助記得的妙法。並且不多做是不易熟的。</p>
<p>當習題中有繁雜而不易解的，耗費了刻把鐘，還不曾解决；這時，你可做下一門，把上一門暫時拋開，到習題做完時，重做一下，有時會馬上悟到而解决。這樣對於時間也不致耗費過多，而興趣却非常濃厚呢！</p>
<p>小朋友，我們學習算學，第一，要懂得所讀的；第二，要記得所懂的；第三，要寫得所記的；第四，要解得所寫的。能彀做到這四個連環的步驟，無論如何難的算題，總解得出來的，你們試一下才知道哩！</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>他要瞧甚麼呢？柏德希悄悄地想，把它那雙表　同情似的大眼睛，仰瞧小南洛。</p>
<p>有一天，那守門的人恰走開了，那兩扇大鐵門恰開著一半，它就跟著小南洛溜了進去，瞧見了小南洛所要瞧的東西。原來是歌壇兩面的兩幅極大的壁畫。</p>
<p>小南洛跪在那兩幅神聖的壁畫之前，快樂得甚麼似的，他一見了柏德希，疾忙站起來，輕輕地拉了它走出門去，他的臉上濕濕的滿沾著眼淚，仰望著寺內幾處遮有的布幕的所在，低聲向柏德希說道：——「柏德希只爲的一個人窮苦而不能出錢，就不能瞧見那些畫，這是何等難受的事！我知道那作畫的人，當初作了這畫，决不會不許窮苦的人瞧的。他一定願意給我們隨時去瞧，——天天去瞧，這個我也可以確定的。然而他們却把這些畫遮蓋了起來，——遮蓋在黑暗之中，那美麗的東西啊！——它們從沒有瞧見天光，也沒有人們的眼睛對它們瞧，除非富人們來出了錢。要是我能夠一一的瞧見它們，那麼我雖死也滿足了。」</p>
<p>但他决不能瞧見那些畫，而柏德希也不能幫助他，因爲禮拜寺對於參觀那神聖畫的，代價是定得很高的，他們要得到這麼一筆錢，直等於爬上禮拜寺的尖頂一樣的困難。</p>
<p>他們是從來沒有一個多餘的錢的，有了錢，就得買一些木柴，放在爐子裏燒，弄一些肉羹放在鍋子裏煮，這是他們最大的力量了。但那孩子的心不斷的想望著要○一○那遮蓋著的偉大的聖畫。</p>
<p>在晨光熹微中，他們匆匆地在這古城裏走着，太陽還沒有出來，人們也沒有起來，小南洛和柏德希拖著那一小車的牛乳，挨門挨戶的送著，在這孩子的夢想中，仍是在禮拜寺裏的聖畫，他又冷又餓，赤脚穿著木鞋，冬天的寒風吹著他的　髮，把他薄薄的衣服也吹了起來，但他還是很高興的想著，他眼中所瞧見的只有那聖母馬利亞的荘麗的臉，伊即黃金色的頭髪，波浪般的披在伊的肩頭，永生的陽光亮亮的照射在伊的額上。小南洛，一個窮苦的孩子，旣不識字，也沒有智識，人們也並不注意於他，那知他却有愛畫的天性。</p>
<p>沒有一個人知道。像他這麼一個小小的孩子，沒一個人知道。</p>
<p>只有和他常在一起的柏德希，見他常常拿著粉筆在石上作畫，聽得他在那鋪草的小床上，給那偉大的畫家，喃喃地祈禱作福;瞧見他每在夕陽斜照中或玫瑰色的晨光中，那一張小小的臉就會亮起來；柏德希又覺得一滴滴熱淚，從他小眼中掉落下來，掉落在自己黃毛蒙耳的額上。</p>

<h3 id="c203">關於電話加價的爭執 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 如在</p>
<p>過去上海電話，無論商用或家用，收費辦法都是按月計算，並未有决數的限制。但在不久以前，上海電話公司突然頒佈新章，規定商用電話費每月十元，可通電話一百五十决；家用電話費每月六元五角，可通話一百次；逾額每决收費三分。這個新章頒佈後，一般商家都認為是變相的電話加價，在這市面不景氣的時侯，實不能接受此種辦法，因特組織「上海特區電話問題委員會」負責交涉，要求增加基本决數，以輕負擔。但經該會多方交涉，毫無結果；電話公司態度非常强硬，新章勢在必行。後來納稅華人會華董提出折衷主張四項：「一，將電話專家所建議之按决收費價目表修改如左：商用電話費每月銀幣十元，可通話二百决，家用電話費每月六元五角，可通話一百五十决；二，將上項修正之價目表定於一九三六年四月一日起實行，亦卽為現在暫行一律加價百分之十一之辦法施行滿一年之一日（暫行加價辦法，係自一九三五年四月一日起施行）；三，採用上述修正價目表後，無論何時，倘公司投資所得純利超出所許可之百分之十，本局應立卽請公司將價目修改，俾電話費立卽减低，倘上述修正價目施行後，公司投資所得利潤不及百分之十，則在施行該項價目之日起，五年內公司不得再請加價；四，本局應請公司將營業及維持等費再為切實　節。」對於這個折衷辦法電話問題委員會巳馬上表示可以接受。但經工部局總董與電話公司商談後，該公司除第三條第一點及第四條願意接受外，其餘的都拒不考慮。同時，不知是什麽緣故，在公司拒絕華董之折衷主張後，報上又刊載了納稅華人會致電話問題會的函件，說有很多用戶對公司新章已「認可接受」；接着電話問題會在駁覆納稅會中也有憤而解散的表示。現在，公司已正式通告各用戶，决定從三月一日起實行新章；電話問題會在市民的督促之下，又表示願繼續奮圖，並定於三月十日召開三次各團體聯席會，以决定一切。是則爭執很久的電話問題，在最近便可見其前途如何了。</p>
<p>事實上，各商家和住戶之所以裝置電話，不消說是為的自己之實際需要；凡有電話的人家，有必要時當然耍用，無必要時也絕不會以打電話來尋開心。所以，電話公司的限制用戶通話决數的所謂新章，很顯然地並不是在防止「濫費」；其目的明明白白地是在一個「利」字。再說，依據實際情形，一般家用電話一月限定通電話一百次，或可够用：但商用電話每月規定一百五十决，平均每天五次，這却是不敷應用的。假使一家商店平均一通十次電話（這是很可能的），那依公司的規定，每月便要多用一百五十次品　按三分一次計算，每月這商店就要多担負四元五角的電話費。這在那些大的百貨商店老板看來，倒好像算不了什麽，但一般正陷於無法維持門面的中小商入，却是難於担負這新加的負担的。</p>
<p>自然，設公司，置產業，以及一切工商業的經營，揭穿來說，都是在圖利；上海電話公司不消說也想每年多得一點利潤，這本是不足怪的。但該公司在計算自己的利潤中，也當為經常供給他們利潤的商人市民們想想，想想這些人在這百業凋敝中，是吾還能增加新的負祖，是吾還能給自己求得更多的利潤。我們常聽到一般中小商人說，他們一年四季都在為大房東，為水電公司，為電話公司找錢，他們自己是長期緊迫，永遠不景氣！這話是眞實的。所以，在許多商店宣告淸理，關門的時候，在「大减價」「大拍賣」的廣告普遍於每一條馬路的時候，在大家實在沒有辦法的時候，商家和一般市民們曾發起了减租運動，以圖减輕一點負担；這個運動現在雖還沒有獲得極大的一般的成功，但已有了部分的些許的效果；事實上有些地方的房租已實行减低了，還有些地方的大房東甚至自動實行减低房租，這當然是頗識時務的表現。然而，上海電話公司在這情形下，却反而實行變相的但實是最厲害的電話加價，這實在是毫未替為他們找錢的一般商家及市民設想的表現！</p>
<p>現在，電話公司的新章已開始實行了，一般電話用戶乃至一般市民當然還要努力反對，我們在這裹除希望反對者奮鬥到底外，更盼望一般市民在平時就注意本市的與我們生活有最大關係的一切公用事業，如水電，電車等。因為這些都是我們日常生活所必需的，主辦這些的人可以控制我們，隨時任意加價。就拿這决的電話加價來說吧，電話公司的態度為什麽這樣强硬呢？這一方面自然是因為如電話委員會說的「藉外力之伸張，强權在握」；但另一方面也因為電話為有些人家所必需，如這些人家不願加價，公司卽可將他們的電話拆去，使之大感不便；所以他們才能控制這些用戶强硬實行加價。至於水電，電車，那更是為一般市民所必需，因而它們的公司也更能控制一般市民，當然同時也就是我們所應該特別注意的。這個注意的目的，就是要用大家的力量來監視這些必需的東西的任意加價，以過分地剝削我們。大家應該明白，所謂大家所需要</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的東西，也就是依靠大家存在的東西，如果這種東西的價格太高，超過一般生活水平以上，那大家要一齊來對付它，不讓它的價格太高，也是可能的。一切必需的東西的價格，一方面自然是這些東西的所有者所規定，但同時在另一方面也是由需要者規定的；假使所有者規定的為需要者完全拒絕，那這規定也就絕對不能實行了。</p>

<p>— 劉楊朱</p>
<p>我曾在匡廬山下的一個中學校教過兩年書，在那兒兩年之中，允其是暑假中，得着不少朋友的來信，羨慕我職業的所在，說是幾生修到，隨時可登牯嶺消夏；豈知事實有大謬不然者，牯嶺雖不拒絕我們窮教師，然經濟可以限制我們的。一到夏季，牯嶺的物價指數比山下要高幾倍，天生成是給一般有閒的資產階級享福的，加之，剛革過命，軍隊如毛，軍費浩繁之故，不得不移挪教育經費以應急，於是教育經費有時竟積欠至半年之久，在上課期間還可以推舉代表向教育廳請願索薪，待各校一放假，教廳知道沒人來請願，落得不問，所以暑假中特別窮困，有時買米錢都成問題，還談得上游牯嶺嗎？</p>
<p>然而，我們有一决確乎曾經苦行游牯嶺的。和同事四人，每人帶了少數的錢，在一個盛夏的黎明出發，步行到連花洞正是午前十時左右。在茶館裹憇息了一會，吃了幾個饅頭，喝了碗苦茶，大家乃向山上走。山路有十五里，不過有整齊的石級，我們都覺得這個山路很好走，走上牯嶺眞是易事。轉了幾個山抝，風景愈加淸幽，淙淙的泉聲，令人悠然意遠！走到半山，已無絲毫炎慹，風動竹簍，雲生脚底，我們不禁大呼痛快！</p>
<p>走到距牯嶺三里路時，不料瀟瀟地下起雨來了，接着在風襲來，山鳴谷響，眼前一片烏黑，同行蔡君一聲「啊呀」，頭上的草帽被吹得不知去向，我們都不覺有點恐慌起來。大家祇得戰戰兢兢地挨着山崖走，石板上的靑苔又特別的滑，萬一失足，那面就是無底似的深谷，眞不知葬身何所呢！</p>
<p>我們都沒有帶雨具，衣服都被打得濕淋淋的了，幸而碰着一個農人，我們交錢給他，請他替我們買雨傘，他呌我們在一個凉亭裹等他，眞是「禮失而求諸野」。不久的時間，他替我們買得雨傘來了，乃鼓勇走上了牯嶺。</p>
<p>牯嶺眞是個好所在！有當於詩意的石路，路旁隨處開着鮮艷的草花，隨處聽見汨汨的流泉。建築物各依山勢而造成，很少磚牆，大多是用本山的大石塊砌成的，而建築物的形式與色彩也很少是雷同的。</p>
<p>牯嶺，一切都是詩，一切都是畫。</p>
<p>我們在街市上和附近的山頭跑了一會，已是午後三時了。飢餓之火有點冲得我們頭昏，而牯嶺物價之昂又是久仰的，找到了幾個飯店，都不敢走進去。好容易找到了一家破舊的麵館，料定他一定不貴，於是走進去果腹而出。</p>
<p>再又在牯嶺的各處走馬看花的逛了一會，這時山中突起大霧，白茫茫一片，連建築物都看不見了。投宿旅店罷，又沒有錢，乃硬着頭皮下山去。大家約好，一步一趨地前呼後應，在霧裹摸索着。石磴上的靑苔，經雨霧一潤，更加油滑，大家都想：萬一滑跌下山死了，那纔寃枉！眞是「如臨深淵，如履薄泳」地，千辛萬苦，回到了蓮花洞，緊張的情緒纔鬆了一點，然大家已經是滿身苔痕泥跡，不成人形，狼狽之狀，不禁相視而嘻。</p>
<p>迨走回家時，已是晚七時半了，睡在床上，簡直不能動彈。此行的經騐告訴我們，「上山容易下山難」為不移之論：蓋下山時，身不由主，大有呌天不應，呌地不靈之苦，又如「上台容易下台難」，也是同一道理。</p>
<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c205">自由農場主人尢懷皐先生 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 胡淸源</p>
<p>是東風比北風還要凜冽的一個下午，我冒着嚴寒的天氣在一處綠色的竹籬門口跳下了車子；經了一番投刺的手續，便由一位潘君引導我和那位獻身農葉的尢懷臯先生見面了。</p>
<p>這裏是一間精緻的客室，大的一丈見方的樣子，裹面的陳設雖並不富麗堂皇，却也佈置得有條不紊；從這點上，很可以看出尢氏對於生活的打算確是一位很認眞的人物。我們彼此寒暄了一陣之後，便開始談到了他的事業本身上去了。</p>
<p>據說：近年來的市面雖常處在凄風苦雨的晦暗狀態中，但自由農塲總算由於處理得宜，營業方面並沒受到什麽影響；平均每日的銷奶量，夏季的有一千四百多磅，冬季則有一千八百多磅。</p>
<p>尢氏今年五十一歲，長長的身材，這天穿的是一件素緞的絲棉長袍，裹面襯着西裝襯杉，下身穿了一條西裝長褲；狹畏的臉孔，寬廣的前額，再配上一副細玳瑁邊的眼鏡，十足地顯出是一副學者神情。在他告訴了我關於那一叚自由農塲的現狀以後，臉上便透出一片自慰的光來。</p>
<p>「廳說尢先生從前是在東吳大學求學，後來到美國怎麼會改習農科的？」</p>
<p>「這是由於家庭環境關係。因為我家裹田地很多，大部份都是租給佃農耕種，那些農人的慘苦生活給與我的印象太壤，所以我後來留學美國，便决心改習農科，預備將來回國後，對於我國的農業多少有一點貢獻。」</p>
<p>「在美國留學了多年吧？」</p>
<p>「唔！我是在宜統元年出國的，到民國五年纔回來。在那七年的讀書生活中，天天都是在埋頭從事於農事的研究；每年暑期，還要到鄉間去實習。」</p>
<p>「這種留學生的生活，照你這麽說起來，似乎並不怎麽舒服的呢！」</p>
<p>「哈哈，留畢生的生活本來就沒有一般人所想像的那麽舒服，允其是一個勤於學業的學生，那更是苦不堪言的。而且，我因為要提早畢業，縮短肄業的期限，所以每年的暑期，除往鄉下去實習外，還要到康奈爾大學所設的暑期學校去一補習；因為一個暑期的功課至少可得到六個學分，積了四個暑期便可以縮短一年。」</p>
<p>「尢先生辦自由農塲的動機大概是起於在鄉下實習的時期吧？」</p>
<p>「那時倒沒有想到。不過，我學的是農村經濟兼畜牧兩科，所以對於畜牧事業特別感到有興趣。」兩隻手緊捧着茶杯，作了一次回憶的神情。</p>
<p>一這「自由農塲」是回國以後就開始創設的麼？」</p>
<p>「不！」沉思了一下說：「回國不久便和幾位相契的朋友合資創設了「中國蛋產貿易公司」，用科學方法裝運鷄蛋出口，但結果因為成本太高，不易推銷，辦了一年多的時期，大的虧了一萬多元，就此停歇了。後來，我又想設立一個養鷄塲，費了半年工夫，從事調查和設計，但結果又因了種種困難，中止進行了：第一因為鷄蛋價賤，鷄食昂貴，農家養鷄沒有多大費用，成本較輕，養鷄塲不易和他們競爭；第二，養鷄在一處極容易發生傳染病，鄉人養鷄分散四處，疾病很少，所以沒有什麼大的犧牲。這兩項事業雖然先後都告失敗了，但是我那「三畝地與自由」的計劃還依舊縈迴在我的腦中。所以，在民國七年間，我又開始進行養奶牛的企圖了。從民七年開始籌備，一切調查設計的工作都由我獨自兼任，整整費了一年半的工夫，才於民國九年正式成立了。「自由農塲」的「自由」兩字便是我那「三畝地與自由」的出典。」</p>
<p>「自由農塲的開辦資本大概總很雄厚的吧？」</p>
<p>「不，」他怕我失望似的，略停一停說：「做一椿事業倒不必斤斤較量於錢的多少，而毅力却是很需要的。自由農塲開辦資本祇有一萬五千元，奶牛也祗有三頭，但到現在，資本却擴增到二十多萬允了。」</p>
<p>「在草創之先，大的是費了不少籌劃的吧？」</p>
<p>「唔！這倒的確是費了一番深思熟慮的選據手續的。我選擇這自由農塲地基的標準，先是確定五個條件：　交通便利，　租價低廉，　要有各種設備，　要有推廣的餘地，　租期至少二十年。我到處託人設法，足足費八個月的時間，居然照我預定的目標獲得了現在的地基，每年租金二百元，租期暫定十四年，後來加到廿四年，租金也由二百元加到一千元了。」茶房送上一杯熱騰騰的牛奶，他接着喝了一口，很得意地接着說：「這地基租定之後，我就繪了一張平面圖，把牛棚，機器間，寫字間都規劃好了，才向工部局請領照會，開始建築起來。」又喝了一口牛奶，像說書似的談得愈加起勁了：「房屋是用磚造的，但因限於經濟，所以不得不處處打算，一面要經濟，一面要美觀。於是便决定牆用白色，　門用綠色，屋面用紅色；但當時外國紅瓦很貴，在財力上頗不易辦到，因此我就想了一個方法，用中國舊有的瓦片，加上一種紅色，便成了外國紅瓦。記得名建築師呂彥直博士見了我這種瓦還稱賞過一回。」</p>
<p>「在剛開辦時的營業狀况……」</p>
<p>「在那時簡直談不到什麽營業。」他不等我說完便搶着說：「剛剛說過，開辦時奶牛祇有三頭，本來是四頭，一共費去三千二百元，不料從嗬囒運來的途中死了一頭；每天出奶祇有百多磅，定戶也不過數十家。這樣過了一年，把一萬五千元的資本虧折得個干凈，後來我又把自己的住宅變了現金，加入資本裹面，仍繼續經營下去，一直虧蝕了五年，才漸漸有點轉機。奶牛由三頭加到十五頭，三十頭，直得現在共有九十頭；定戶也由數十家而遞增到五千餘家。」</p>
<p>「最近幾年來大概總有不少的盈餘吧？」</p>
<p>「從開辦的五年以後，逐年都有點盈餘；不過，因為自由農場的組織不是公司性質，所以每年的盈餘，除提出四千八百元作為我歷年墊出的六萬元資本的年息而外，其餘都作為公積金，預備隨時擴充生產及添購奶牛機器等等。」</p>
<p>「自由農場旣不是公司組織，何必又多那麽一種形式呢？」</p>
<p>「這一種手續倒不是「畫蛇添足」。因為這裹雖不是公司組織，但仍多少有點外股，而且生產的組合也是集體的；如果把自己個人和農場混淆不淸</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，那麽就不能使一般工作同人發生好的印象。」他一面說着話，一面從寫字檯上拿了一本簿子過來，一頁一頁地翻給我看。。「你看，這是歷年來農場裹所給我的薪水的數目。一九二〇年到二二年，這兩年中可說是白盡養務，一文的薪水也沒拿過，到一九二三年才規定了每月五十元，到二五年加到一百元，以後每過兩年增加五十元，直到現在才有三百元的薪水了。三百元的薪水還不算多吧？」他笑着反問我一句。</p>
<p>「若拿你對於自由農場的勞績來說，三百元自然是不算多啊！這裹職員的待遇也很不壞吧？」</p>
<p>「怎麽好也說不上，不過這裹許多職員和工人都差不多是從開辦時做到現在，所以對於他們的待遇好到怎樣，從這點上也許可以推測得到的。」很謙虛地說着。</p>
<p>「聽說尢先生在蘇州還辦了一個農場，那邊的成績又怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「是的，那是我和舍弟共同經營的，到現在也有好幾年了。資本祇有一萬元，農場佔地五十畝，奶牛有三十餘頭，每天平均產奶五百磅；在那裹就是由他負責管理，成績也不算壞。其决還在杭州闢了一個農場，這是自由農場的分場，資本倒有三萬元，奶牛却祇有十五頭，每天產奶的三百多磅。」</p>
<p>「奶牛除了嗬囒種以外，還有別的種可用麼？中國牛為什麼不能產奶？」</p>
<p>「奶牛要算嗬囒種最好，加洲雖有奶牛，但究不及嗬囒牛產奶的豐富，中國牛却絕沒有方法能使牠產奶的。」</p>
<p>「如果拿嗬囒牛和中國牛交配以後生的小牛，是不是可以產奶呢？」</p>
<p>「這是一椿費力多而收效極小的工作。據研究所得，嗬囒牛和中國牛交配，至多第一代小牛能產少量的奶而外，其餘如第二第三代就沒有效能，到第四代則仍恢復中國牛的本色了。」</p>
<p>「一隻嗬囒牛每天的產奶量，究竟能有多少？」</p>
<p>「這却不能一概而論，因為這裹面原因很多。譬如一隻嗬囒牛在牠本國每天可產奶六十磅，一到了中國就會减少到三十磅；再等到牠養的小牛將來產奶時，竟會少到祇有十餘磅了。我這裏所有的九十頭牛，平均算起來，每天每頭牛大的可產奶十五磅。」他一團說着，一而拿幾機自來火　做成了統計向我解釋。</p>
<p>「這大槪是因水土的關係吧？」</p>
<p>「當然，這也是原因之一，不過飼養料方面也有關係，因鴛喂牛的食料，在外國大部份是用白花的革頭（White-Clover）和Alfolfer幾種，這幾種草的滋養性很大，所以外國牛的產奶量也比在中國喂養的牛大得多了。我在美國學習擠牛奶時，就看到他們都是用白花的草頭喂牛，而且每一個有牛的農戶差不多都有一二百畝田地專用來種那種白花的草頭的。這種草在開花時其中含有花蜜很多，花期又長，一般農戶不但靠牠喂牛，並且還要靠牠養蜜，但在中國就沒有這麽廣大的區域來供給耕種牛吃的草料！」</p>
<p>「美國也有像這樣的農場麼？」</p>
<p>「美國的牛奶事業非常發達，但其組織却逈然不同，像「自由農場」這樣的更不多見。他們那種牛奶的來源大半出自農戶，每一家一天產奶三十磅至幾百磅不等，這是要看農戶養牛的多少而定的；每天產下的奶還不等天亮便要送到一個收奶的機關，以後消毒，裝瓶，分送便都是這機關的工作，農戶絲毫可以不過問了。據說近年來這種牛奶事業更加進步，收奶機關自備有收奶汽車，每天早晨沿村收取，農戶祇要在裝奶的桶上寫明重量若干，收奶員便替他記下了。這種情形，祗有在美國可以辦到，在中國却一時還不能達到那種境地；這一方面是因為中國牛奶公司的組織不同，一方面也因為農村畜收事業還不發達。所以，我們要把中國的牛奶事業改進，同時並注意推廣農村的畜牧事業啊！」</p>

<p>— 子滿</p>
<p>老馬識途，老醫少下，這是讚頌「老」的，無怪乎廣州耍開耆英大會，太原要舉行敬老大會，可知「老」的確有其可敬的價値的。</p>
<p>「你們這般小孩子，懂得什麽？我活了六十多歲還不曉得，你倒曉得！」似乎老的人一定知道，年少的人一定未必會知道，因為老人終是「老」，老人因此可以「倚老賣老」。</p>
<p>「老」旣是可讚頌的，可尊敬的，那末「少年」自然也得學「老成」些，沒有鬍鬚的時侯也得捋捋下巴，無故咳幾聲嗽，像煞有介事的踱踱方步。</p>
<p>「俺老子……你小子……」這樣空口話說出來還是漂亮的，雖然你目不識丁，狗屁不通，掛羊頭，賣狗肉，但憑了這「老」的字牌兒，你還怕那一個的？</p>
<p>話得說回來，「老」不得當，自然成了「老悖」「老邁」「老朽」等等名稱，那眞是「老」中的糟糕了。故「老」當益「壯」者，乃「老」之補救辦法也。</p>
<p>讀去年一月十日時事新報評論「釋敬老」有云：</p>
<p>「我們認為敬老的對象，並不是敬其「年高」，而敬其「德劭」。敬重他們當中能為人羣利益奮鬥的份子，而學習並接受其推動社會前進的經騐與教訓，至於像×××一類老奸巨滑的皓首匹夫與蒼髯老賊，他們不但已成為時代進化的古董，且為民族復興的隊礙。……</p>
<p>「……那般充滿於社會的遺少，他們從精神到肉體已是未老先衰，在形式上固是翩翩年少，而日常的生活實無異於昏庸老</p>
<p>於是我知道，敬老應當敬其所當敬。本來我想老與少原是就年齡對比稱呼，同樣是人，在人羣中似乎無須輕視與尊敬。</p>
<p>看了那一般馬齒徒增的老人，不感到「年華易逝」，「枉度一生」，反沾沾以年「老」而自喜，及一般精壯少年，不奮起「靑春之火」，只學「老成」，說「老話」，鑽古書堆，「終日想如何過淸閒逍遙日子，實不禁令入倒抽一口氣。</p>

<p>— 辰夫</p>
<p>——北新書局出版，每冊定價九角——</p>
<p>周作人先生是國內有名的散文大家，他那混雜着許多「之乎者也」等類的文言字句的「白話文」，會獲得了「簡潔」「淸淡」的稱蠶，「欲據牛角尖負隅以終身」的什麼大師甚至把他的文章用來作「語錄體」的招牌，以與新的白話文對抗。這些都是大家所知道的。「苦茶隨筆」便是類集了他近年作的一些雜文的一個集子，運「小引」和「後記」在內，其中共有長短不等的五十篇文章。如果由形式上區別起來，那這五十篇文章大概可以分成三類：一，讀舊書的抄錄和感想，二，為別入的著作寫的序言，三，一般雜感隨筆。這些文章或許也是大家都看過的，而且，在別的刊物上還有過「好評」，現在似乎用不着多說。不過，我讀過這本集子後，總覺得有講幾句話的必要，因此便提起筆來說說這「苦茶隨筆」了。</p>
<p>「苦茶隨筆」雖不是一本有體系的著作，只是一些雜感隨筆凑成的集子，但就在這中間，首先我們也能看出作者的人生觀。在「蛙的教訓」一文中，知堂老人——周作人先生就明白的告訴我們：</p>
<p>「其實叫老年跟了靑年跑這是一件很不聰明的事。野　民族里老人的處分方法有二：一是殺了者來吃；一是帮同婦雜留守山寨，在壯士出去戰爭的時候。叫他們去同靑年一起跑，結果是氣喘吁吁地兩倏老腿不聽命，反遲誤靑年的路程，抬了走做傀儡呢，也只好吓唬鄉下小孩，總之都非所以「敬老」之道。老年人自有他的時光與地位，讓他去坐在門口太陽下，搓繩打草鞋，看管小鷄小鴨兒，風雅的還可以看板畫寫魏碑，不要硬叫子媳孝敬以妨礙他們的工作，那就好了。……把靈魂賣給魔鬼的，據說成了沒有影子的人，把靈魂獻給上帝的，反正也相差無幾。不相信靈魂的人庶幾站得住了，因為沒有可賣的，可以站在外邊，雖然罵終是難免。」</p>
<p>知堂老人當然是老年，上面這段話便是他為一般老年也是為他自已辯護的。依據這個辦護，他便决定了老年不應跟靑年跑的老年人的人生觀：他旣不願「把靈魂賣給魔鬼」，也不願「把靈魂獻給上帝」，因為這反正都是「相差無幾」。於是，他便只有「坐在門口太陽下，搓繃打草鞋」，與夫喝喝苦茶，抄抄舊書，寫寫打油詩了；除此之外，什麽國家民族，人生社會</p>
<p>不過，周先生的這種老年人的人生觀，又似乎不是單由他的年老規定的，這與現實的國</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hitler's Announcement to England, France, Italy, and Belgium: Abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and Immediate Dispatch of Troops into the Demilitarized Rhineland Zone. Frequent Consultations Between Ambassadors of Related Countries in Paris and London. France Decides to Submit the Issue to the League of Nations Council for Discussion. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: Reich Chancellor Hitler has declared the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and has informed the ambassadors of the signatory nations through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. German troops have already entered the demilitarized Rhineland zone. (Havas urgent dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Following the announcement of the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, Reich Chancellor Hitler will propose to the signatory nations to negotiate a new treaty to replace it. He also stated that Germany is willing to rejoin the League of Nations, but with conditions. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Cologne: The German action of reoccupying the Rhineland area began at 5:00 AM this morning. German troops first entered the German-owned town on the east bank of the Rhine River, opposite Cologne, and then entered the four cities of Mainz, Koblenz, Cologne, and Frankfurt amidst the wildly enthusiastic cheers of the people. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Cologne: Several German military aircraft flew over this area today. Residents cheered for them. Troops and tanks paraded through the streets. Cologne is located in the demilitarized Rhineland area. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: Following Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, the French government has decided to submit this issue to the League of Nations Council for discussion. The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on the 10th of this month. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: Following Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and the dispatch of troops into the demilitarized Rhineland, the French army will suspend or immediately stop granting leave starting this evening. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army have all been summoned to Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: After German Chancellor Hitler announced the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, immediately reported to his government. After receiving the report, Premier Sarraut immediately convened Foreign Minister Flandin, Minister Without Portfolio Pengou, Minister of the Army General Maurin, and Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mandel (also in charge of affairs in Alsace and Lorraine) to meet at the Presidential Palace. He also invited the Chief of the General Staff of the Army, General Gamelin, to attend. Afterwards, Premier Sarraut announced that Foreign Minister Flandin would meet with the representatives of the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty, namely the ambassadors of England, Italy, and Belgium, this afternoon to discuss the implications of Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the treaty. The Cabinet is scheduled to meet at 6:00 PM this afternoon and will hold a cabinet meeting on Sunday. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: In response to Germany's repudiation of the Locarno Treaty, the French political circles are maintaining a policy of "calm." After the government invited representatives of the signatory nations (excluding Germany) to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 6:00 PM this afternoon, Flandin will issue a statement to the press tonight in response to Hitler's speech and Germany's document repudiating the Locarno Treaty. It is now believed that France will petition the League of Nations in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and Article 44 of the Treaty of Versailles (stating that if Germany violates any of the provisions in Articles 42 and 43 in any way, it will be considered an act of hostility by Germany against the signatory nations of this treaty and will disrupt world peace). (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The London authorities are currently unwilling to comment on the situation arising from Hitler's declaration. It is understood that they need to conduct a thorough study before expressing their views. It is now known that on the eve of Hitler's declaration, Britain had expressed to Germany its willingness to conclude a Western Air Pact. Foreign Secretary Eden met with the French and Italian ambassadors this morning, then went to Chequers to meet with Prime Minister Baldwin. The Cabinet has not held a special meeting, but cabinet members will discuss Germany's actions during the scheduled cabinet meeting on Monday. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government is not at all displeased with Hitler's declaration of repudiating the Locarno Treaty and is particularly satisfied with the mention of colonies and Germany's rejoining the League of Nations in the declaration. Italy believes that the League of Nations is currently too dominated by England and France, and Germany's accession could balance the power. It is now known that the German government had advised Mussolini in the middle of last week to jointly repudiate the Locarno Treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: Following Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, officials here stated that Italy and Germany have not reached an agreement on this matter. The Italian authorities have also not made any decisions regarding the close cooperation between Italy and Germany. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations community now believes that Germany's action of repudiating the Locarno Treaty will not lead to military consequences and that there is a possibility of peaceful resolution through a special meeting of the League of Nations. Regarding the opinions of officials on Hitler's declaration, it is believed that if Hitler's declaration had not included the repudiation of Germany voluntarily acceding to the Locarno Treaty, this move could have greatly contributed to the security of Europe. However, Germany preferred to adopt a stubborn approach, notifying France that if the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty is ratified, Germany will consider itself to have withdrawn from the Locarno Treaty. It is generally felt that Hitler's speech is intended to drive a wedge between the close relationship between England and France. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the issue of re-fortifying the demilitarized zone on the left bank of the Rhine River, Foreign Minister Neurath met with the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, this morning and declared to him that only a small number of German army units had entered the demilitarized zone as a gesture, and there was no intention to send a large number of troops there. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Germany's announcement today that it no longer recognizes the Locarno Treaty, which designated the Rhineland as a demilitarized zone, and its subsequent dispatch of troops into the Rhineland has shocked all of Europe. The ambassadors to Germany from the Locarno Treaty signatory nations (England, France, Italy, and Belgium) were presented with a document from German Chancellor Hitler, containing the following key points:</p>
<p>Germany is dissatisfied with the Locarno Treaty due to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty.</p>
<p>Germany believes itself to be no longer bound by the provisions regarding the demilitarized zone. If Belgium and France also have demilitarized zones, then Germany is prepared to agree to new demilitarized zones. If England and Italy act as guarantors, then Germany is willing to sign a 25-year Western Non-Aggression Pact. Germany is willing to allow the Netherlands to join this pact. Germany is willing to conclude a Western Air Pact and an Eastern Non-Aggression Pact including Lithuania. If the above six points are agreed to, then Germany is prepared to rejoin the League of Nations, but the League of Nations Covenant must be separated from the Treaty of Versailles. The German document also stated to the ambassadors that Germany is currently sending several battalions of soldiers into the Rhineland as a symbolic action and not with the intention of reoccupying the area by force.

<p>Berlin: In a speech delivered today in the Reichstag, Chancellor Hitler also made some statements regarding Franco-German relations. He said that Germany has made efforts towards France. Germany had submitted concrete proposals to France regarding the issue of armaments. Germany concluded a naval agreement with England in June of last year, which is the only agreement on reducing armaments. Germany has proposed that Germany, France, and England conclude an air pact based on the principle of equality. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Hitler Delivers Important Speech to the Reichstag: Reason for Abrogation of Locarno Treaty Lies in Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Reichstag special session was very crowded. Premier General Göring announced the opening of the session, followed by a speech by German Chancellor Hitler. The speech was transmitted to the public via loudspeakers. Many people listened in the parks and streets outside the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the Status Quo: Hitler stated that General Göring was ordered by him to convene this meeting. People naturally believe that this meeting is extremely important. Germany has suffered significant sacrifices due to the new ideas created by President Wilson's Fourteen Points and the establishment of the League of Nations. Today's international atmosphere is more tense than ever before. The god of war has not yet laid down his arms, but military preparations even more extensive than before are proceeding throughout the world. Germany is not responsible for this situation. In the past twelve years, Germany has not been a governing country but a governed one. The treaties were not drafted based on principles of statesmanship but were created in an atmosphere of terror and hatred. There has never been a basis for establishing lasting peace between neighboring countries. Germany has never disrupted European peace. Any effort to resolve European problems that disregards culture and nationality will only create a situation that is undesirable in all respects.</p>
<p>The German Problem: Amidst applause, Hitler spoke of the importance of national unity, saying that the German problem is a noisy one, but this is not related to the German political system but is a problem for 60 million Germans. We Germans certainly have the same needs as the French or the English. Foreign newspapers discuss Germany's difficulties with unfair remarks. It must be understood that other countries forced Germany to borrow money and then destroyed Germany's export trade, and finally blamed Germany for not being sincere in repaying its debts. If economic and political events were properly resolved sooner, Europe would have been spared many troubles. The countries of Europe are one family, and although there are times of discord, their relationship is extremely close. Abandoning common sense will inevitably lead to explosions and leave future troubles. In the view of many, the so-called German problem is Germany's warmongering, its ambition to manage other countries, and its ability to conquer enemy countries. In short, Germans are no less diligent than other Europeans and want to have the same right to live as others. Germans, like the French or the English, do not want to be nihilists and are willing to die for their country. Peace-loving French and English people should be able to understand this problem.</p>
<p>Soviet Interference: One of the difficulties Germany has encountered is the Soviet interference in Germany. I am determined to resolve the difficulties created by the Treaty of Versailles. Germany's rearmament in the past three years has not been intended to revive European problems but to solve them. In the past three years, I have repeatedly sought understanding with France, but to no avail. I do not know why we cannot value the difficulties of Europe and despise petty rivalries and grievances. As for Russia, I oppose cooperating with it because it aims to Bolshevize the whole world.</p>
<p>Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance: Today, we have heard that the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty has emerged. I have worked for three years for Franco-German understanding and I am confident that I can achieve some success. However, all my proposals have been rejected. Only the British government, with a pragmatic view, has accepted my proposal for a naval limitation agreement. This is the only result of disarmament efforts. My proposed Locarno Air Pact has also been rejected. It would have been easier for me to incite the German people to recover, but I do not do that. I have worked harder than any other politician on psychological preparations, because the willingness to seek rapprochement is more important than the effort to create divisive alliances. The Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty violates the spirit of Locarno and is more serious than any other treaty France has concluded. Will Bolshevism not spread to France? Will France not become a second Moscow? We shall see in the future. I recently made a statement to French journalists, but this statement was secretly suppressed by France until the Reichstag passed the Franco-Soviet treaty. I am not only serving European understanding but also following the will of the people. Our people would rather endure hardship than give up their honor and freedom.</p>
<p>Declaration of Abrogation: At this point, Hitler read out the German note to France, containing seven points, and stated that the Franco-Soviet treaty was directed against Germany. Based on this treaty, France would be forced to be hostile to Germany, which is contrary to the principles of the League of Nations. The note also stated that the Franco-Soviet treaty undermines the Locarno Treaty, and France's understanding with Czechoslovakia and Russia will be harmful to peace. Hitler then announced the reoccupation of the Rhineland. The audience cheered for several minutes. Finally, Hitler reviewed the work of the National Socialist Party in the past three years. Hitler spoke for an hour and a half. At 1:35 PM, General Göring announced that the Reichstag would be dissolved on March 28, and new elections would be held on the 29th. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Göring Announces Reichstag Re-election at the End of the Month: The People Will Reaffirm the Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: After Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech at the Reichstag today, the Speaker of the House, Minister of Aviation General Göring, immediately took the floor and said that the Reichstag will be re-elected on the 29th of this month. The people can decide on the government's diplomatic policy of striving for equal rights with other countries since three years ago. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Reichstag convened at 12:00 PM today. Chairman of the session, Speaker and Minister of Aviation Göring, Hitler then presented the note sent by the government to the ambassadors of the signatory nations regarding the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, read it out, and delivered a lengthy speech. Before the Reichstag convened, the streets from the Prime Minister's Office to the Reichstag were guarded by the Blackshirts. During the meeting, all cabinet members, staff officers, and the diplomatic corps were present. The arrangement of the chamber was extremely simple. When Chancellor Hitler entered the chamber, all members and those in the audience stood up to pay their respects. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Hitler Spends the Day Drafting Speech and Meeting with Army Generals <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Reichstag will convene at noon today. It is expected to be a very important meeting. Hitler will attend and deliver a lengthy speech of significant nature. Hitler spent the entire day yesterday drafting the speech, which was only completed this morning. At the same time, the German government has asked the ambassadors of England, France, Italy, and Belgium to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning to hear the declaration regarding the Locarno Treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: It is rumored that Germany is now preparing to give France and Belgium guarantees regarding Germany's western border. The news has caused great shock here, as it is feared that it will provoke France to take military retaliation. It is generally believed that Hitler will not issue a verbal warning but will show the world what has already happened. However, his refusal to recognize the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty regarding the Rhineland area will be a gesture. Hitler hastily convened a meeting of German army generals to discuss the matter. It is said that senior generals expressed the view that reoccupying the Rhineland area by force would be dangerous. The actual strength of the German army today is not yet sufficient to cope with the situation, but Hitler did not think so and still insisted on his position. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">European Situation Tense: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Says We Cannot Ignore It <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>London: Quarters here say that the European diplomatic situation is now extremely tense, and changes will occur soon. In general, if the oil embargo is actually implemented, then the general trend will likely lead to the following results: Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Albania will all withdraw from the League of Nations, and even Switzerland may follow suit. Italy will declare the abrogation of the Franco-Italian military agreement and will no longer be a guarantor of the Locarno Treaty. Germany will re-fortify the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River. People in the Foreign Office are deeply concerned about this. Cabinet members held continuous talks today to study the evolution of the diplomatic situation and prepared to respond to the questions raised by France. (France would ask Britain what attitude it would take if Italy declared the abrogation of the Franco-Italian military agreement and if Germany re-fortified the Rhine River.) However, Britain is currently in talks with the German government and will respond to France after the talks have yielded results. People in the Foreign Office believe that the entire security issue of France can be resolved in the following way: the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty (namely England, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany) jointly sign an Air Pact and include the resolutions restricting air armaments. The countries sign bilateral air technical agreements with each other. As for the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, political figures believe that there is no hope for sincere peace negotiations at this time, so the oil embargo should still be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said in Birmingham last night that we cannot close our eyes to what is happening elsewhere in the world. We must make our country safe. The government has decided to build an air force capable of severely damaging enemy forces so that the enemy will not dare to start a war rashly. We do not want war, we hope there will never be war, but we must prepare for any eventuality. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Hirota Accepts Military's Demands: Replaces Several Appointed Cabinet Members. Foreign Minister Concurrently Serves as Minister of Justice, Minister of Colonial Affairs Changes. New Cabinet Can Be Formally Established Today. <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Hirota has agreed today to comply with the Army's views in selecting the personnel of the new government. After all-day meetings, the situation has greatly stabilized tonight. The predetermined list of cabinet members will apparently be changed. It is now believed that some people will be removed to comply with the Army's wishes. An important meeting will be held tomorrow morning, where Hirota will submit the proposed new list to General Terauchi and ask for his approval. If the Army agrees, then the ceremony of appointing the ministers will be held on Sunday afternoon. This morning, Terauchi met with Hirota for 30 minutes, stating that the military wants to establish a truly strong and powerful cabinet to cope with the national crisis. The military is strongly opposed to politicians with a strong liberal appearance joining the cabinet and to politicians from political parties serving as Minister of Home Affairs. Military leaders do not want to disrupt the new cabinet but insist on a strong, unified national cabinet. They are now willing to wait patiently for two days for its formation and are willing to sincerely cooperate with Hirota. Terauchi then met with Army Minister Kawashima of the Okada cabinet.

<p>Tokyo: Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujinuma announced the following at 6:00 PM on the 7th:</p>
<p>Negotiations between the cabinet formation headquarters and the Army are proceeding smoothly, and the cabinet can avoid failing.</p>
<p>Baba Eiichi and Nagata Hidejiro are confirmed to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>Currently, the issues are Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru and Minister of Justice Ohara. The policies of the new cabinet will be determined after the cabinet is formally established.</p>
<p>The cabinet formation headquarters has the determination to implement policies to the extent discussed by General Terauchi. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Dr. Shimomura Hiroshi, one of the reasons why the Army avoided becoming a cabinet member in the new Hirota cabinet, and which caused a setback in the cabinet formation work, resigned from joining the cabinet to Foreign Minister Hirota late on the 6th, given the surrounding situation. Therefore, the cabinet formation headquarters has notified the Army today. (Dentsu dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota's compromise plan to the military is to cancel Dr. Shimozai Hiroshi, who was internally appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs, and not appoint Kawasaki Takugo as Minister of Home Affairs, but instead appoint another person, or temporarily suspend the appointment of Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru as Minister of Foreign Affairs, but instead have the Prime Minister concurrently serve, etc. By these conditions, he will obtain the support of the Navy and complete the cabinet formation satisfactorily in order to manage the situation.

<p>Tokyo: The cabinet formation work was dissatisfied with the Army in its first stage, causing setbacks. The reason for this was that Foreign Minister Hirota was eager for success with a pigheaded approach, and because he used Yoshida Shigeru, who was unfamiliar with such work, as his advisor. Therefore, at his meeting with General Terauchi, Foreign Minister Hirota, who believed there was a promising future and that there was light at the end of the tunnel, took this opportunity to replace Yoshida's advisor and appointed Baba Eiichi, who was well versed in laws and regulations, understood the political and financial situation, and also had some contact with the military, as the chief advisor for the cabinet formation. He abandoned his previous work and started anew. As for the selection of cabinet members, those who have already been evaluated are carefully proceeding with small-scale changes. In short, the results of the cabinet formation work currently have a 60% chance of success and seem to have been satisfactorily resolved. (Dentsu dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Army Chief Official Okabe, Minister Keijin, has been traveling between the Hirota cabinet formation headquarters and the Army authorities for days, making efforts to mediate and bring the opinions of the two parties closer. Okabe, Chief Official, gave a speech at 2:00 PM on the 7th, saying that as a result of today's meeting between General Terauchi and Prime Minister Hirota, the situation is better than before. The Army has not put forward specific opinions on the selection of cabinet members. I met with the new Minister of Finance Baba Eiichi today and explained the Army's views.

<p>Rome: The cabinet held a Council of Ministers meeting today and decided to accept the proposal put forward by the League of Nations Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and to conduct peace negotiations with Ethiopia. (Havas urgent telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: This morning at 10:00 AM, the cabinet held a Council of Ministers meeting at the Viminal Palace to discuss the proposal put forward by the League of Nations Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Prime Minister Mussolini presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 12:00 PM. A communique was then issued stating, "The Prime Minister has submitted for discussion Italy's proposed reply to the Thirteen-Nation Committee's proposal, the content of which is to accept in principle the proposal to conduct peace negotiations." According to information obtained by our correspondent, Italy has accepted the Thirteen-Nation Committee's proposal, but on the condition that the League of Nations does not intensify sanctions against Italy. (Havas telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that Abyssinia still has the capacity to fight for several years. Referring to the peace efforts of the League of Nations' Thirteen-Nation Committee, the spokesman stated that Abyssinia is unwilling to cede an inch of territory to Italy as the price of seeking peace. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: The French Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Chambrun, held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday. The Italian Ambassador to France, Mr. Cerruti, held discussions with Foreign Minister Flandin this morning. The discussions all concerned the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia. The Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to issue a statement on the outcome of the talks. However, it is generally expected that Italy will not propose any conditions when responding to the League of Nations Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee. On this point, the Thirteen-Nation Committee's proposal only used the phrase "the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant" and did not propose conditions or mention sanctions. In short, if Italy's reply accepts peace negotiations in principle, the session of the Thirteen-Nation Committee will naturally be extended in order to decide on the procedures to be adopted. The negotiations may proceed based on Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant (regarding the amendment of treaties). Conversely, if Italy refuses to negotiate, the embargo on oil will undoubtedly be implemented. (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Diplomatic talks are currently being held in Rome and Paris regarding the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia. According to sources at the League of Nations, after these talks, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will submit a reply to the Thirteen-Nation Committee, agreeing to conduct negotiations with Ethiopia, but will at the same time declare reservations on certain points, the specific nature of which is not yet known. The future course of negotiations will depend on the nature of these reservations. (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Moscow: Political figures here have declared that the appointment of former Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota to form a cabinet is a sign that the country is willing to adopt a moderate policy. It is said that Hirota served as the Japanese Ambassador to Russia from 1931 to 1933, and was already known at the time. He was later transferred to become the Foreign Minister in the Okada Cabinet, and he and the late Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo strongly opposed the large budget proposed by the military. Although his promotion to Foreign Minister was on the recommendation of former Army Minister General Araki, and he has not suffered any harm during the recent Tokyo incidents, these two points show that Hirota has a friendly relationship with the military. However, after he takes office, his measures will not worsen relations between Japan and Russia. This is what everyone believes. In addition, after Communist Party General Secretary Stalin made a statement to the President of the Associated Press, Howard, yesterday regarding the possibility of Japanese aggression against Mongolia, a deep impression has been made here. The government newspaper Izvestia published an editorial today to ease this impression, saying, "The Japanese have always been known for their straightforwardness. It is hoped that Stalin's straightforward attitude will be recognized by Japan." The attitude adopted by the Soviet Union can be seen in the Izvestia editorial. In political circles, it is believed that the announcement of the appointment of former Foreign Minister Hirota to form a cabinet, after Stalin made the above statement and the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, visited Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, is enough to ease the mood of Soviet people. (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: Foreign Ministry officials have declared that the appointment of former Foreign Minister Hirota to form a cabinet in Japan has been generally welcomed here. Hirota's foreign policy, especially his policy towards Russia, has always been known for its moderation, which is well known to Europeans. Recently, Hirota negotiated with the Soviet Union to organize a joint Russo-Manchukuo supervisory committee to resolve border issues between Russia and Manchukuo, which is one example. However, the situation in Tokyo is still chaotic, and it is not possible to make a hasty judgment on the future of the political situation. Political figures believe that after the recent incidents in Tokyo, many important leaders of the military have resigned (referring to Military Councilor General Masaki, General Hayashi, General Abe, General Araki, Commander of the Kwantung Army General Minami, former Army Minister General Kawashima, etc., who have been placed on the reserve list). This may intensify the opposition of the military, making it more difficult for Hirota to form a cabinet. (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington: Senate silver faction senators have conflicting opinions regarding the value of the Treasury Department's policy of purchasing newly mined silver from North and South America. Senator Pittman, leader of the silver moderates, stated that the new policy is very satisfactory. Senator Thomas, leader of the inflationists, expressed the opposite view, believing that there is no benefit in buying silver without minting silver coins, as this is no different from storing zinc in the Treasury. Some sources predict that the Treasury may withdraw from world markets, but it was learned from responsible sources today that the Treasury intends to continue purchasing some silver from the world market. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Commercial Daily reported today that the US Treasury Department's contact with the Bank of Canada to purchase newly mined Canadian silver is another move against speculators. Previously, US companies could sell newly mined Canadian silver directly to the US Treasury Department if they had the appropriate certificates. The current new law prohibits speculators from engaging in this trade. Treasury officials have previously explained that this move is very consistent with Treasury policy. In addition, the Treasury Department has also entrusted Mexican banks to purchase Mexican silver for the US. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">US Senator Proposes That the Government Establish a Department of Territories; The Status of the Philippines Becomes a Question <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Gibson proposed today the establishment of a Department of Territories, with a cabinet member serving as minister. The Senate is likely to consider this matter on Monday. At the same time, he announced a plan to build territorial radio stations to arouse public interest in territorial issues. Because the status of the Philippines has not yet been determined, some people question whether the island will belong to the department. However, since the law stipulates that genuine independence will be granted to the Philippines in 1946, there is no doubt that the Philippines will be subject to the department's control before independence. As for the affairs of Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guam, Midway Island, and the Virgin Islands, they will all be handled by the department. In addition, small islands in the Pacific such as Wake Island, Palmyra Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, and Baker Island will also be under the department's jurisdiction. The only territory outside the United States that is not subject to the department's control is the Panama Canal Zone. Currently, the various territories are under the jurisdiction of various government departments. The Philippines belongs to the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Department. Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Guam, Samoa, Midway Island, and other Pacific islands are under the control of the Navy Department. According to confirmed information this afternoon, the territorial radio station will begin broadcasting at 5:00 PM to 5:38 PM on March 11. Regarding the program, the responsible parties have contacted radio stations in Hawaii and Alaska. In addition to Gibson, Senators King and Trammell will also speak. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Our country's finances have temporarily gained a respite due to the implementation of the new public debt plan, but in order to seek a fundamental solution, in addition to improving political and economic conditions, it is necessary to rectify the current tax system. The government has recently been preparing to introduce an inheritance tax. The draft prepared by the Ministry of Finance has been completed and can be implemented after it is approved by the Central Political Council and the legislative procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Inheritance tax, which taxes inherited property, is the fairest, most reasonable, and most modern good tax. Although financial scholars initially regarded this as a registration of the state collecting handling fees when transferring property, it is now generally recognized as an accidental and unearned income tax that is not based on personal effort. This tax is levied after inheritance and has nothing to do with the labor of the deceased.</p>
<p>There are two methods of levying inheritance tax: one is to tax the total amount of the estate, which has the nature of a property tax; the other is to tax the inheritance share, which is purely an unearned accidental income tax. Of the inheritance tax systems in various countries around the world, Japan only adopts the latter, while the UK has both. In the United States, the former is a federal tax and the latter is a state tax. Germany had an inheritance tax on the total amount of the estate in 1919, but after 1922, the former was included in the latter.</p>
<p>Our government advocated inheritance tax very early on. The National Financial Conferences in 1929 and 1934 both had resolutions on inheritance tax, but it was not implemented due to too many obstacles. Now that the Ministry of Finance has a further concrete plan, it should be able to break through the past inaction and introduce this new tax in the near future. We would like to advise the government on this matter: The progressive tax rate should not be too low, so as not to lose the meaning of regulating the national economy. The investigation and evaluation work must be fair and accurate in order to prevent abuses. If the financial authorities can pay attention to the above two points, then the inheritance tax can be promoted to its full potential.</p>

<p>Hankou: Yang Yongtai, Xiong Shihui, and He Jian met in the provincial government on the 7th to discuss post-suppression affairs in the border areas of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. They agreed on a plan and will implement it step by step. In the future, the garrison teams of the three provinces will strengthen communication, regardless of boundaries, and jointly suppress the bandits within a time limit. Local post-war affairs will also adopt the same steps. He Jian arrived in Wuchang from Hunan at 7:00 AM on the 7th.

Xu Daoyuan, Luo Lin, Li Zongjian, etc., have all arrived in Hankou to participate. Everything must wait for the decision on the 8th. Yang Yongtai said that the problem of the meeting is to clear up the border areas and to decide on a plan that will coordinate steps, not to hold a meeting. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Hankou: Yang Yongtai will host a luncheon for He Jian, Xiong Shihui, etc., on the 8th to discuss the issue of clearing up the scattered bandits in the border areas. There will be no formal meeting. Yang Yongtai also told people on the 7th that the main issue for this meeting of the three provinces' authorities is the clearing and post-war affairs of the border areas. The hope is to determine a plan at this meeting to step up the clearing up of the areas. The authorities would also like to establish a common goal in self-defense, Baojia, and road construction in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Outside sources stated that there will be a meeting, but this is not the case. (Central News Agency telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Hankou: He Jian arrived in Hankou at 7:00 AM on the 7th and stayed at the Fourth Route Army Office. He visited He Chengjun after 9:00 AM. In the afternoon, he crossed the river to visit Yang Yongtai and Xiong Shihui to discuss the problem of clearing up the border areas of the three provinces. In addition, Luo Shujia, deputy director of the Hunan Security Bureau, arrived in Hubei Province on the evening of the 7th to participate in the discussion on clearing up the scattered bandits in the border areas. He Jian said that after the search and suppression of the bandits in the Pingliu area of Hunan, the remnants are hiding in the Tonggu area of Jiangxi. The bandits have fewer than 400 guns. No matter how elusive their movements are, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. As for the problem of clearing up the remnants of bandits in the area bordering western Hunan and western Hubei, it is not intended to be discussed at this meeting. When Xiao He was entrenched in western Hunan, his strength was more than 20,000. After several painful suppressions by our army, more than half of them have been wiped out. After fleeing to Guizhou, they have suffered repeated defeats. Now there are only less than 10,000 people left, wandering in the areas bordering Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. The bandits are attempting to join forces with Zhu and Mao. There are two points to pay attention to in the bandits' recent actions: They take advantage of the situation to flee, without a fixed direction, making it difficult for our army to intercept them. They specialize in barren land, changing their previous actions of destroying fertile land. Their actions are swift, traveling one or two hundred miles in one night, making it difficult for the army to pursue them. Recently, a telegram was received from the front, saying that there has been heavy snow in the Sichuan-Guizhou border area for days, so there has been no major contact. I will stay in Hankou for one or two days and then return to Hunan. (Central News Agency telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Why Mussolini Wants War <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Loius Fisher, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>——Observation of the European Situation under the Cloud of Killing Intent (Part 1)</p>
<p>Mussolini deeply believes in the supreme authority of war. "Fascism," he wrote in 1932, "never believes that permanent peace is possible or hopeful. Why? Because only war can maximize all the powers of mankind. It adds a solemn crown to those countries that can openly fight. No other attempt can be compared with war."</p>
<p>On December 11, 1925, Mussolini told the House of Representatives: "I regard the Italian nation as being in a state of war forever. I have said, and I will repeatedly say, that the next five or ten years are the critical juncture that will determine the fate of our country. Why are these years a critical juncture? Because the international struggle has already begun. It will become more acute with the advancement of the times. We will appear on the world stage with all our strength and will not lag behind." Amidst thunderous applause, he continued: "As for me, I live for war, for adventure, for desperate efforts." This is Mussolini's loyal warning to Europe. Of course, no one listened to him.</p>
<p>For fear that anyone would still have doubts about his ambitions, he reiterated them on December 11, 1925. "The fundamental obligation of Fascist Italy," he said, "is to replenish its armaments on land, sea, and air. We must be able to mobilize five million people. We must strengthen our fleet. Our air force must be strengthened until its rattling machine sound overwhelms all the noisy sounds on the peninsula, and its wings darken the boundless sky. In this way, between 1935 and 1940, when a tragic scene occurs in European history, we can make our voices loud. We will make our authority recognized by the world. But this, of course, requires several years of preparation." Mussolini is truly a great and active figure. He is also the most frank politician in Europe. As a Roman daily, Ottobre, always reveals on its masthead: "Mussolini is always right." And now, we are precisely in "between 1935 and 1936."</p>
<p>Mussolini's attempt is to conquer foreign countries. Personal ambition, personal pride, and the politician's view of his historical mission have shaped his policies. Mussolini considers himself to be the modern Caesar, dreaming of a new Roman Empire. Rome is an eternally beautiful city. Mussolini has spent a lot of effort in repairing Roman monuments. As soon as I arrived in Rome, I went to the great Palazzo Venezia. It was made of stones moved from the ancient Roman Colosseum. It used to be the Pope's private property and is now Mussolini's headquarters. From here, there is a wide Imperial Avenue, with Trajan's Forum and columns on one side, and the Roman Forum on the other, leading all the way to the solemn and great Colosseum. Before the Roman Forum, there is a brick wall, on which Mussolini inlaid four large marble maps. The first map is Europe, the upper part of Africa, and the Near East, made of pure black and shiny marble, with green stripes around the sea, and the city of Rome is marked with a circle of coffee color. It shows the situation at the beginning of the founding of Rome in the eighth century BC. The second map represents the Roman Empire in 146 BC. The coffee-colored circle has expanded to include half of Spain, Corsica, Sardinia, Italy, the Illyrian coast—present-day Yugoslavia—Macedonia, Thrace, and Carthage. This is the situation after the Punic Wars. In 14 AD, as shown in the third map, Rome controlled all of Spain and France, Germany south of the Rhine, southern Europe bounded by the Danube, Constantinople and its hinterland, Asia Minor, Cilicia, Antioch, Syria, Palestine, Egypt south to Sudan, Libya, all of Carthage, and part of Numidia. Trajan (98-117-A.D.) developed the empire to its highest peak. His borders, in addition to the past coffee-colored entirety, also included Britain, Germany (as far as the Baltic Sea), the Balkans (almost to Russia), Cappadocia, Armenia (to the entire Caspian Sea), Mesopotamia (down to the Persian Gulf), and Arabia. Mussolini is of course paying attention to that fourth map. His Roman ancestors conquered Britain before they wanted to occupy Abyssinia. Now, Mussolini wants to reverse that precedent.</p>
<p>Reason tells us that there is no room on that brick wall to accommodate another map. But Fascism is still trying its best to impress the psychology of imperial worship into the minds of the people. "Empires are constantly rising and falling in alternation," a haughty Fascist said to me yesterday. "Can the British Empire continue to exist permanently?" This kind of argument can be heard everywhere. Five days ago, I had a long conversation with Rossoni, who can probably be regarded as the third most important figure in Italy. He said: "Some people think that the world is stable, but the driving force of history cannot be ignored. I always believe in imperialism." Mussolini himself has explained this dogma several times. In 1926, he said: "Italy demands that the great powers recognize her need for sunshine and land. If they do not recognize it, Italy will have to take decisive action."</p>
<p>"Africa and the East (that is, Asia Minor) are the direction of Italy's development," as Mussolini said in March 1934. He has several "apprentices" who are even more certain. They think of Abyssinia, that is certain, as well as Egypt and India. It is a fact that the Italians have tried their best to organize and seduce Indian students studying in Europe. On October 12, 1935, nine days after the start of the Abyssinian War, the Roman newspaper; Massaggero said:</p>
<p>Italy has simultaneously gained a very superior position in India's economic and moral foundations. All of India has united under the common feeling of hatred for the alien governors who rule them. India is willing to express respect to countries that challenge Britain. ... Britain's attempt to instigate people of color to oppose us appears to be a failure. The majority of the people in India can understand the benefits of this, that is, Italy's advancement into Africa is no different from India's resurrection... Enslaved Indians are regarding us as their last hope. The Jewish Fascist nationalists led by Jabotinsky are trying their best to advocate that Italy take over Palestine. The Italian authorities have given them encouragement. Italy has been watching Syria. Everyone knows about Rome's attempt to gain a foothold in Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. These ambitions will have no end.</p>
<p>The motives behind imperialism are very inconsistent, and public opinion often changes with them. Indeed, recently a small number of scholars have proposed that imperialism is no longer caused by economic reasons. Therefore, Mussolini's policies can be said to be an unusually interesting question. If we know the source and nature of Fascist imperialism—this may have a great relationship to that chaotic world.</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Reasons for Rural Decline in China <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>President of the Agricultural College of Central University, Ji Shuwen</p>
<p>What I am going to say today about the reasons for rural decline only concerns the situation in China. And I will divide what I am going to say into two parts: I will summarize and discuss the opinions expressed in various journals and newspapers on this issue; and I must also express my personal views, which are somewhat different, on this topic.</p>
<p>I. Summarizing the general opinions on the causes of rural decline and discussing their importance.</p>
<p>Since China opened its doors to foreign trade, it has been shocked by the strength of other countries. Most people have focused on the development of cities, completely ignoring the countryside. Recently, they have gradually realized that cities are not the only solution, and have turned to paying attention to revitalizing the countryside. Recently, there have been countless articles in magazines and newspapers about this. Summarizing the reasons for rural decline, they generally fall into the following three categories:</p>
<p>External oppression is still the main reason for the decline of rural China, including the aggression of imperialist powers and the extraction of exorbitant taxes. Under the oppression of these two external forces, the countryside has no choice but to decline. First, let's talk about the aggression of imperialist powers:</p>
<p>Imperialism initially used force to oppress China, in addition to ceding land and demanding huge indemnities. Besides the inability to control tariffs, they were also allowed to set up factories and banks in the country. This political and economic aggression, coming from both sides, has caused China to suffer direct and indirect losses of more than tens of millions of yuan every year. Moreover, foreign goods, with the protection of the lowest tariffs and the backing of warships, can come smoothly and occupy the market directly. Even in remote rural areas, the most basic daily necessities are replaced by foreign goods. Our original Chinese handicrafts have all been defeated by foreign goods, and the prices of agricultural products have fallen below the cost of production. Farmers work from dawn to dusk, busy all year round, but only to benefit others, while they themselves suffer from cold and hunger. If you open the customs trade registers for the past hundred years, you will know that, except for the last three years, when the value of goods fell due to special reasons such as the Northeast being occupied, the value of imported goods has been increasing year by year since the beginning of the Republic of China until the 20th year of the Republic of China. The annual outflow of money has even reached 200 to 300 million yuan. What we buy are foreign goods that suppress our domestic products, and very few necessities for developing our domestic industry. Therefore, not only is the amount of trade deficit alarming, but there is also a real danger of reducing the sales of local products. The speed of rural decline has naturally accelerated!</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the extraction of exorbitant taxes. Paying taxes is originally a duty that everyone should fulfill. However, the heavy layers of exorbitant taxes are also an important cause of rural decline. According to the investigation of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, the number of surcharges is as high as fifty or sixty in Jiangxi, more than seventy in Zhejiang, and more than one hundred and five in Jiangsu. As for the amount exceeding the regular tax, Jiangxi Province has more than twenty-five times the amount, which is not much, while Hebei Province even has more than eighty times the amount. In addition to the surcharges on land tax, there is also the "pre-collection," which was not uncommon in Sichuan during the era of the warlord Liu Xiang, who collected taxes several years in advance. Some places even collected taxes up to the 70th year of the Republic of China! In addition, there are also "requisitions" similar to land tax surcharges, which are also collected according to the amount of land or the regular tax. Although this kind of requisition is not as common as land tax surcharges, it is a common occurrence in places where transportation is inconvenient, politics are corrupt, and farmers' knowledge is limited. Moreover, this kind of requisition is often more burdensome than land tax surcharges! Not to mention the various special taxes levied on farmers in various places at any time. With the limited resources of the farmers, and the endless extraction of exorbitant taxes, how can the countryside not collapse! Now the central and local governments are trying to limit land tax surcharges and reduce various miscellaneous taxes, which is a gratifying thing, but the previous wounds are too difficult to heal.</p>
<p>The inherent weakness of the countryside: Unequal land distribution in China, too few self-cultivating farmers in the countryside, the inability of farm household income and expenditure to offset each other, and the inability to improve production techniques are all weaknesses inherent to the countryside, and are also the main reasons for rural decline.</p>
<p>First, the unequal distribution of land: According to the results of the survey, the vast majority of farmers in China only own a very small amount of land, while a very small number of landlords own the vast majority of land. Farmers who are so poor that they have no place to stand, or farmers who have land but are unable to cultivate it, have no choice but to rent land from landlords. Since they rent land from landlords, they naturally have to pay rent. As a result, they have to give at least half of their hard-earned income to the landlords, and what is left is not enough to maintain their basic living standards. Unequal land distribution has led to the complete merger of land by the powerful. This has been a historical trend since ancient times. Private land, royal land, and public land systems were all attempts to solve this problem, but none of them succeeded. Now this problem is even more urgent. How to enable tillers to own land is a topic that must be discussed.</p>
<p>Second, the imbalance of farm household income and expenditure: According to a recent news report, a survey of rural areas in the suburbs of Shanghai showed that in seventy-two villages in the western suburbs of Shanghai, with a total of nine hundred and forty-five households and four thousand and forty-nine people, the total income this year was 97,971 yuan and 5 jiao, while the total expenditure was 149,918 yuan and 7 fen, resulting in an annual deficit of 51,946 yuan and 2 jiao and 7 fen. The average annual deficit per household was 54 yuan, 9 jiao, 3 fen, and 2 li, and the average per person was 12 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 8 li. This phenomenon of income and expenditure imbalance is not only the case in the western suburbs of Shanghai, but also in other places if a detailed investigation is conducted. Because farmers' lives are difficult, they naturally have to live on loans. Self-cultivating farmers also suffer from low prices of agricultural products, exploitation by exorbitant taxes, and high living standards. Their lives are also equally difficult, and they also have to rely on loans to get by.</p>
<p>Following borrowing is the exploitation of usury. According to a report by the League of Nations economic experts, "Usury is the greatest pain for Chinese farmers. The interest rate on Chinese farmers' loans is as low as 33%, and even as high as 100% or more." Since farmers' lives are difficult, their funds are naturally lacking, and they have to borrow to survive. This means they have to use the exploitation of usury to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>Third, the failure to improve production techniques: Our Chinese agriculture was originally based on a small-scale system, which is not suitable for large-scale production. Farmers' knowledge is shallow, and all agricultural techniques are based on old traditions, without improvement. At the same time, the progress of agriculture in other countries is rapid, and the improvement of agricultural products is effective. Our Chinese agriculture, however, remains stagnant, which is inevitably compared unfavorably. For example, tea is a major agricultural export of China. Thirty years ago, our export volume ranked first in the world. Recently, it has been defeated by the tea of Ceylon, Java, and India. Another example is the international silk market, which has also been occupied by the silk of Japan and Italy. Even the main food crops in the country—rice and wheat—have to be supplemented by foreign rice and wheat.</p>
<p>In short, due to unequal land distribution, they cannot escape the plunder of landlords; due to income and expenditure imbalance, they cannot escape the exploitation of usury; due to the failure to improve production techniques, they cannot escape the squeeze of international agricultural products. This is the inherent weakness of the countryside, and its decline is only natural.</p>
<p>The impact of natural disasters and man-made disasters: The decline of the rural areas in China is also greatly affected by natural and man-made disasters. For example, the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China. According to a report by the National Relief Commission for the Great Famine of the Republic of China, in the summer and autumn of the tenth year, 29 million people and 70,000 square miles of land suffered from an unprecedented flood. The disaster area lost 900 million yuan of agricultural crops and 200 million yuan of property. According to a report by the Agricultural Society of China on the disasters in the 13th year of the Republic of China, there were droughts in 220 counties in 20 provinces, floods in 119 counties in 13 provinces, locust plagues in 28 counties in 8 provinces, and other disasters in 76 counties in 13 provinces, disease in 27 counties in 6 provinces, wind disasters in 46 counties in 11 provinces, hail disasters in 41 counties in 10 provinces, frost disasters in 20 counties in 6 provinces, and landslides in 2 counties in 2 provinces, with a total loss of more than 150,000 yuan. According to a report from the National Flood Relief Commission: last year (the 24th year of the Republic of China), the flood affected an area of 74.2 million mu in the Yangtze River basin, affecting 10 million people and causing a property loss of 22.6 million yuan; the disaster area in the Huai River basin affected an area of 80.4292 million mu, affecting 9 million people and causing a property loss of 21.825 million yuan; the total disaster area in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River basins affected an area of 155.739319 million mu, affecting 19 million people and causing a property loss of 54.445 million yuan. What is said above is only the major disaster situations in recent years. There is no year in China where no province is unaffected by natural disasters. The direct losses are certainly great, and the various indirect losses are even more difficult to calculate. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee Plans to Discuss Anti-Communist Measures, Strengthen Defense Forces in Southern Hebei, and Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Provinces Jointly Prevent Communism <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondent: Bandit guerrillas have been discovered in Renxian, Yaoshan, and Julu in Hebei. The authorities have taken measures to suppress them. It is reported that the bandits have established a temporary organization with Renxian as the center, with March 18th as the date for a demonstration. As for Shanxi, Fenyang has not fallen. The Beiping Church has recently received a telegram from the Fenyang Church stating that the missionaries are all safe and there are no Communists in Fenyang.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, convened Zhang Yunrong, Zhang Ji, Yang Zhennan, Qin Dechun, Feng Zhen, and others on the 6th to discuss anti-bandit measures. Zhang Yunrong returned to Baoding at 2:00 PM that afternoon. Before leaving, he told reporters that there were scattered bandits in six counties, including Renxian, Yaoshan, Neiqiu, Pingxiang, and Longping. It was decided to carry out suppression. After returning to Baoding, he will go to Shunde tomorrow (the 7th) to convene a meeting of county magistrates to discuss suppression measures.</p>
<p>Since the bandits fled to Shanxi, the military authorities here, in order to prevent the defeated bandits from invading the territory of Hebei and Chahar, as Shanxi Province borders Hebei and Chahar, in addition to having previously instructed the troops of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar to strictly guard against them at various important locations, recently Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, sent Yan, a member of the Headquarters, to Beiping to visit the local authorities to discuss the issue of assisting in preventing Communism. It is reported that the authorities, considering the close relationship, have agreed to provide assistance within their capabilities. The methods are being carefully planned. In addition, Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Hebei Provincial Security Office, was summoned to Beiping to instruct him on everything and to quickly strengthen the defense forces of the counties in southern Hebei. At the same time, the counties are instructed to reorganize the Baojia system in order to achieve unity between the military and the people and to maximize the effectiveness of Communism prevention under the principle of "three parts military and seven parts political," so that the Communist bandits cannot step into the territory of Hebei and Chahar.

<h3 id="e85">The Puppet State: Restrictions on Chinese Laborers Leaving the Pass Due to Unstable Japanese Political Situation and Puppet Mongol Relations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The border police of the puppet state at Shanhaiguan suddenly, starting from March 1st, refused entry and exit to Chinese entering or leaving the pass. Those who insisted on entering the puppet state had to purchase a special exit permit at a cost of twenty yuan per permit, sold by the Daito Company under the guise of a security deposit. If Chinese laborers could leave the puppet territory within two months of exiting the pass, they could return the permit to the Daito Company in Shanhaiguan and receive nineteen yuan back, with one yuan deducted as a handling fee. Those who failed to leave within the deadline would not be refunded. The puppet authorities did not announce this matter in advance. Before this month, with the occurrence of Mongol-puppet disputes, Shanhaiguan, Gubeikou, and Malanyu implicitly refused Chinese entry, claiming it was to prevent insurgents from infiltrating and causing trouble. However, the restrictions were still based on individual assessment, so travelers could still find ways to exit the pass, though sometimes obstructed. Now, with the promulgation of the new rule, laborers seeking a living outside the pass, besides their shoulder bag, could barely afford travel expenses. Suddenly requiring a twenty-yuan security deposit is tantamount to prohibiting entry. For days, hundreds of men and women have been stranded at Yuguan. On the second night, passengers on the through train from Beiping to Shenyang were blocked, with over three hundred people stranded, unable to advance or retreat. As a result, passenger traffic on the Beining Railway through train from Beiping to Shenyang has sharply decreased, but the trains continue to run as usual to maintain transportation. On the third day, the Beining Railway Bureau specifically issued a notice, publicly announcing the puppet state's measures to restrict Chinese from exiting the pass at Yuguan, advising travelers leaving the pass to be cautious. Those capable of paying the twenty-yuan security deposit should purchase tickets and board the train to avoid being stranded midway, unable to advance or retreat. Also, fearing that many laborers from Zhili and Shandong are ignorant and unaware of the announcement, on the fourth day, all stations were instructed to first ask passengers boarding the train for a special identity card from the puppet Daito Company before selling tickets. Those without it would be refused tickets. Recently, the Oriental Travel Agency, upon request from the Beining Railway Bureau, was tasked with negotiating with the puppet authorities to cancel this measure to avoid excessive losses for the railway. However, the manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, Zhang Yongqi, is not back from Shanghai, and the deputy manager, Hirayama, is unwilling to take responsibility, so negotiations can only take place after Zhang returns. According to the puppet authorities, this prohibition on Chinese laborers leaving the pass is specifically targeted at small vendors and laborers from Zhili and Shandong. Because every spring, laborers from inside the pass flock to the outside of the pass to seek a living, leading to an increase in unemployment within the puppet territory and a surplus of laborers, to prevent them from becoming bandits and disrupting the security of the puppet territory, the authorities decided to implement these restrictions. This measure is not intended to be long-term. However, according to other sources, the puppet's prohibition on Chinese laborers leaving the pass has two causes: The relationship between the puppet state and Mongolia remains tense. The Japanese Kwantung Army's Xiangyue Division is being transported to the Northeast, and its troops in Harbin and Qiqihar are also on the move, fearing unrest during this time. Also, due to the unsettled Japanese political situation, to prevent insurgents from entering the country and taking advantage of the situation to revolt, there is a temporary restriction on Chinese traveling there. The puppet side's plans to advance into the Mongolian-Suiyuan border area are gradually unfolding. The Tongliao-Kuping Railway is about to begin construction. The South Manchuria Railway has commissioned the Okura Corporation to undertake civil engineering work, recruiting Chinese laborers to perform arduous tasks. Okura has set up an office in Tianjin to recruit. Each time laborers are recruited, they are transported in groups of four truckloads through Gubeikou to Chifeng and Dolon. However, many laborers who left the pass to seek employment last year were deceived, ending up with nothing. Therefore, this year, although Okura offers higher wages, very few are responding, and no one is willing to go. The puppet authorities, in order to force Chinese laborers to take this route and prevent them from seeking a living outside the pass, are making it difficult with the special identity card. However, this measure does not apply to foreigners from other countries. (5th)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Sino-Vietnamese Civil Aviation (flights from within China to Hanoi, Annam, connecting with French flights to Europe), its route passes through Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Initially, the Southwestern Aviation Company, operated by the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, negotiated with the French government to operate the route. Later, the Ministry of Transportation of Nanjing ultimately assigned the Sino-Vietnamese route to the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), extending the company's Shanghai-Guangzhou route to Hanoi. It officially opened on February 13th, and a flight had already flown south. On the 27th, CNAC's "Fujian" plane arrived in Guangzhou from Shanghai, carrying a batch of Chinese and foreign mail, intending to fly to Vietnam from Guangzhou as the second flight. Due to bad weather, it temporarily parked at the Ersha Tou Airport. The Guangdong authorities, upon receiving the report, claimed that the Sino-French route was originally contracted by the Southwestern Aviation Company, and now CNAC had not obtained the approval of the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, and that unilaterally sending planes to fly over was considered an act of infringing on public enterprises. Therefore, on the 28th, they sent people to Ersha Tou, stopping the "Fujian" from flying further, and notified the CNAC office in Guangdong, stating that CNAC planes were only allowed to operate on the Guangzhou-Shanghai route and were not allowed to extend the route to French Hanoi. They were instructed to transfer the mail carried by the "Fujian" from Shanghai to the Post Office for delivery. The office had no choice but to comply, first sending the "Fujian" back to Shanghai on the 1st of this month, reporting the obstruction in Guangdong. The right to operate the Sino-Vietnamese civil aviation route is pending negotiation between the Ministry of Transportation and the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, it is said. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Communist Bandits in Various Counties of Hebei Province Decide to Divide Areas for Suppression; The Communist Bandits in Ren County Will Be Resolved Politically; The Suppression Army Actively Begins Deploying Defenses <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Dispatch: In order to eradicate banditry throughout Hebei Province, Hebei Chairman Song Zheyuan previously convened a meeting in Beiping with leaders of various stationed troops, including Security Director Zhang Yunrong, 63rd Army Commander Feng Zhanhai, 53rd Army Chief of Staff Wang Yatang, to discuss suppression measures. Upon investigation, in Hebei Province, apart from the Liu Guitang gang, which had already been completely annihilated some time ago, there were still over ten thousand communist bandits in the Yao Mountain and Julu area of southern Hebei's Ren County. The provincial government has already formulated separate solutions for these communist bandits, deciding to eliminate them through political means. Security Director Zhang Yunrong has also drafted a plan to suppress the communist bandits and a program to reform them, which is being submitted to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee for review. In addition, the 29th Army has dispatched a Liu Battalion of infantry to suppress them, so as to prevent the bandit forces from expanding. In addition to the aforementioned two gangs in the province, other banditry is scattered in small groups. However, because they are scattered in various counties, they pose a threat to local disturbances at any time. Moreover, with the rise of the green gauze curtain, it is difficult for farmers and residents in various counties to live and work in peace. Song Zheyuan believes that eradicating these scattered bandit groups is also an urgent task. Furthermore, because the areas where these bandit groups are scattered are vast, they arise one after another, making it extremely difficult to eliminate them completely. It is necessary to mobilize a large number of troops simultaneously in different areas and wipe them out in one fell swoop in order to be effective. It was agreed with the leaders of various stationed troops to divide the entire province into four bandit suppression areas, with Song's 29th Army, Shang Zhen's 32nd Army, Wan Fulin's 53rd Army, and Feng Zhanhai's 63rd Army each occupying one area, and simultaneously starting to suppress them. Each army has dispatched elite troops specifically responsible for bandit suppression. After this regional bandit suppression plan was agreed upon, the armies have now begun to actively deploy their defenses separately, and it is expected that they will be completely eradicated within two months. The provincial government has also ordered the county governments to promptly report the bandit situation in their counties, so that teams can be dispatched to suppress them. At the same time, it has also ordered the county defense corps to assist the army in bandit suppression at any time. After this large-scale and painful suppression, the banditry in Hebei Province should gradually disappear. As for the communist bandits in the Yao Mountain and Julu area of Ren County, estimated to number over ten thousand, they originated from the six villages (Liu Village, Shi Village, Guo Village, Huai Village, Li Village, Luo Village) and four manors (Gan Village, Zhu Village, Feng Village, Guan Village) of Ren County. The internal organization of these bandits is quite strict, divided into foreign affairs, politics, military affairs, and other groups, with a man named Liu Wenzhong serving as the Red Army Commander-in-Chief and Commander of the Guerrilla Brigade. The so-called guerrilla team is the armed force of the bandits, consisting of thirteen guerrilla teams in total. The uniforms and equipment are very neat, and many of the firearms are new. According to investigations, these bandits have more than fifty submachine guns, over a hundred Mauser pistols, and over three hundred 38-type rifles. Last year, Zhu De and Mao Zedong provided these bandits with over twenty thousand yuan, and there were also three female students who had returned from studying in Russia, mixed in to guide everything. Recently, since the Liu Battalion of the 29th Army began suppressing them, the bandit situation is no longer as rampant as it used to be. However, these bandits gather and disperse unpredictably. Moreover, because they already have a considerable organization and have been persuaded and lured, it is necessary to start by correcting their ideology. Therefore, the provincial government is currently awaiting the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee's review of the bandit suppression plan and reform program, so as to base its actions on them, and has decided to resolve the issue with 30% military force and 70% political power.

<p>The trade associations of various industries in Wu County, previously, due to the telephone bureau of Guo County changing the telephone charging method, which increased the monthly telephone fees for the associations of various industries by one yuan, unanimously expressed opposition. In the meantime, the telephone bureau had suspended telephone service to the county's chamber of commerce. Thereupon, it aroused public indignation in various industries. Although telephone service was subsequently restored, the charging issue remained unresolved. Submitting a request to the ministry for instructions also yielded no positive results. The county's chamber of commerce specifically submitted another request to the Ministry of Transportation yesterday (7th), stating its reasons and requesting a reduction in the telephone fees for the associations of various businesses and the restoration of the previous situation.</p>

<p>The Suzhou-Fubo (between Suzhou and Guangfu) Highway's Su-Mu (Mudu) section was completed, and it was opened to traffic in the summer of last year. The Mu-Guang section's roadwork is being continued by the Construction Bureau and is about to be fully completed. Starting next month, the Suzhou-Fubo Road will be fully open to military traffic. The Suzhou-Fubo Long-Distance Bus Company is scheduled to convene a joint board meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss matters related to the full road opening. As for the highway from Guangfu to Wuxi, because the route issue has not yet been resolved, there is no construction period yet. It must wait until the route issue is resolved before construction can begin.</p>

<p>Wu Jiang Li Town's rich merchant Zai Xingbo's son Bingren, currently 29 years old, graduated from Wuhan Advanced School and studied aviation and infantry at the Japanese Military Academy. He excelled in his studies. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), after returning to China, Sichuan Chairman and Commander of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression, Liu Xiang, recruited military specialists to attract talent. Wang was introduced by his father's friend and entered Sichuan to serve. He was initially appointed as a staff officer at the school and then transferred to the Independent Army Brigade Headquarters, serving as a military procurement officer and purchasing agent. Wang achieved success at a young age and often frequented the pleasure quarters in his spare time. He met a famous courtesan named Hongniang and they fell in love. However, Dingniang repeatedly demanded money, causing Wang to embezzle up to 20,000 taels of silver. He wired his father for help, but Zuxingbo ignored him. Wang, unable to do anything, discussed it with Hongniang. In November of last year, he embezzled 13,000 yuan of public funds from the military supply office and fled with her, disappearing without a trace. After the incident, Liu wired Commander Chiang and the military headquarters, issuing a nationwide warrant for his arrest. Recently, Liu learned that Wang, under the alias Lan Ting, was hiding at No. 10 Haihong Lane in Suzhou City. He immediately instructed the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Office to request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Wu County Government to arrest him.</p>

<p>Chen Yuchu, the police chief of this county, previously considered opening public brothels due to the prevalence of private prostitutes. After a county government meeting, it was decided to postpone the plan and actively prepare for the establishment of a women's relief center. All private prostitutes and fallen women would be sent to the center for relief. Subsequently, Wu Bangzhou, the director of the Civilian Vocational Training Center, drafted a plan to establish the Wuxi Women's Relief Center and submitted it to the county government for forwarding to the provincial government for approval. After receiving the submission, the provincial government immediately approved the Xichun County government to include all establishment expenses in the budget for the 25th year of the Republic. However, the request to build the relief center's housing was not approved. Perhaps it will be attached to the current civilian center. Currently, the civilian center plans to convene relevant parties to discuss a proper solution in a meeting, so as to prepare for the establishment in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The Tangkou Electric Light Factory in the 8th district of the county previously lost over two piculs of white rice due to theft. Yang Fengqi, the patrol officer of the 7th sub-bureau in charge, along with Xu Ahui, the tea boy of the factory, went to search for the stolen goods. Suddenly, a conflict arose with Li Shirong, a worker at the same factory. Li's scrotum was kicked and ruptured by Xu, leading to his death due to serious injuries. Prosecutor Shen went to the countryside to examine the body and confirmed the cause of death, and the murderer was sent to the court for detention. After several trials by Judge Liu, the final debate was declared. Yesterday was the date for the verdict in this case. Judge Liu read out the main text of the verdict: Xu Ahui was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for causing death by injury. Li A'er and Li Baofa, relatives of the deceased, were sentenced to two months of imprisonment each for obstructing official duties. Zhang Wencai was sentenced to three months of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The riverfront sandbars in this county rise every year, and people rush to the finance office to claim them for enclosure, leading to many disputes. Besides litigation, there is even armed fighting, which the government cannot prohibit. Recently, due to the increasing number of disputes, the provincial government ordered the deployment of security teams to guard the villages. Unexpectedly, the sandbank on the south side of the Shazhou City Nantian Beach, from Nanfeng Town to Masi Bridge, which was originally claimed by Zhang Yuan and was ordered to stop construction due to disputes, was seized by Wang, who hired over 500 workers to build and enclose it near Dachunpu. When the He'an team stationed in the village heard the news, they went to stop them and were surrounded by the workers, who beat the team members arbitrarily. As a result, squad leader Yao Binghua and two team members were injured. They have already gone to the city to report to the team headquarters for investigation.</p>

<p>The Southeast Township Academy and the West Township Office of this county managed property, which the province previously ordered the county Education Bureau to take over. It repeatedly and strictly ordered the county government to urge the Education Bureau to implement the takeover. Representatives of the two groups, Mao Youru, Chen Zhongda, and others, were dissatisfied and submitted a petition to the provincial government, filing an administrative appeal. It was decided to change the decision and transfer all the school property to the Education Bureau for management. After receiving the ruling, the two groups still did not comply and filed another appeal with the Ministry of Education, which was again rejected. They continued to file a lawsuit with the Administrative Court as a final resort. At the same time, they dispatched representatives Jiang Hong and others to Beijing to visit the authorities and argue their case according to law. After over a year, it remained unresolved. Until the other day, the Executive Yuan decided to cancel the appeal decision and the original decision. The property of the two groups will be managed by the township offices and academies, with the county ordering them to select personnel to take over according to regulations.</p>

After arriving in Xiang, stationmaster Liu Kaiyi negotiated with the police platoon leader to purchase supplementary tickets. Other military police officers suddenly used their rifle butts to smash the doors and windows of the bus, and even tried to beat the driver. After stationmaster Liu intervened, they stopped. It is reported that the Shanghai-Nanjing Company believes that this situation obstructs road operations and is negotiating with the public security authorities.</p>

<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>(Travel Correspondence from Our Reporter) Recording the Lu River Bridge</p>
<p>I left Changsha for Zhuzhou on the morning of the 4th. The train I took was the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Pingxiang section, also managed by the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau. This route was originally only the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang section, run by merchants. Later, it was nationalized and extended from Zhuzhou to Changsha, serving as the only thoroughfare for transporting coal from Pingxiang. The passenger car I boarded was a converted wooden shed used for transporting goods, dilapidated and filthy, beyond imagination. But this was the only passenger car, and there was no other choice. After the train started, both sides were lined with shops, barbershops, teahouses, small restaurants, with everything available. At first glance, it almost seemed like traveling in an alleyway by train, which was quite amusing. It was not until outside the suburbs of Changsha that it emerged from the alleyway and headed into the open fields. As for the situation inside the car, it was similar to the Yangzhou ferry. Peddlers shouted and sold all kinds of food, with everything available, except for women singing songs. I heard someone in the car say, "This train travels very slowly. People who want to freeload can jump on, and when the ticket inspector comes, they can jump off. There are even some brave ones who cling to the bottom of the car to hitch a ride. There are iron rods between the axles at the bottom of the car, and people sit on the rods without any fear. If they lose their grip and get crushed to death, people will scold them for being useless." Alas! How pitiful. Changsha has a lot of rain. When this train travels, passengers must have umbrellas because the roof leaks. During heavy rain, they may be drenched all over. So-and-so said this, and I could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Around 1 p.m., the train arrived in Zhuzhou. Zhuzhou is a small town belonging to Xiangtan, the starting point of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. When the future Beijing-Hunan Railway is completed, this town will surely be a key location. However, because it is close to Changsha, it seems that there is no prospect of commercial development. After getting off the train, I immediately went to the office of the Second Subdivision of the Seventh General Section of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Engineering Bureau for a short rest. The place was an ancestral hall, with spacious houses, extremely rare in this remote area. The surrounding mountains overlapped, and clear water flowed around the front door, making the scenery quite pleasant. Engineer Jin Shidi and Section Chief Xie Yue of the Train Operations Section have been working here for more than two years, and life is very lonely. I smiled and said to them, "The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section will soon be open to traffic. The mental pleasure of completing a great achievement should compensate for the loneliness of life." After stopping in Zhuzhou for two hours, I transferred to the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Bureau's engineering vehicle to Lukou to visit the Lu River Bridge. Midway, we passed the home of General Section Chief Wu Siyuan and climbed down from the car using a ladder in front of his door. This was the first time in my life that I had gotten off a car in this way. After resting at Wu's home for half an hour, we rode in a hand-cranked car to the bank of the Lu River. Upon investigation, the most difficult projects in the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Bureau of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway are bridges and tunnels. The southern section has more tunnels (the southern section also has five major arch bridge projects), and the northern section has more bridges. Of the bridge projects, the construction of the Lu River, Mi River, and Lei River was more difficult. The Lu, Mi, and Lei rivers are all tributaries of the Xiang River, and are necessary routes for the railway. After I boarded the hand-cranked car, four workers drove the car like flying. The weather was cold, and the wind was strong, making it unbearably cold. I felt very bitter, but then I thought about how hard the staff on this road worked, and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to come and see it. Why should I be afraid? My spirits were lifted. After twenty minutes of driving, we arrived at the bank of the Lu River, and the majestic bridge was revealed before my eyes. After getting off the car, we crossed the river to the south bank, led by Section Chief Wu, and walked through several wooden frames to visit the tenth pier. This pier was the final project of the bridge, and there were many workers who were pouring cement into the pier. The scene was very intense. The place where I was standing was already below the river surface because to build the Lu River bridge pier, it was necessary to first build a dam to cut off the water flow. We were standing inside the dam, so we were below the river surface. The width of the Lu River surface is 300 meters between the north and south banks. When the water level is at its lowest, it is only three meters deep, but at its highest, it rises to 18 meters. The length of the Lu River Bridge is 344 meters, with a height of 21 meters (from the bridge base to the top of the pier). There are two bridge abutments (that is, the two ends of the bridge) and ten piers, totaling eleven spans. There are seven plate girder spans, each span being 18 meters long, and four truss girder spans, each span being 55 meters long. Every year, from late spring to early summer, around April and May, is the time when the Lu River floods. During this time, there is a lot of rainfall, coupled with flash floods, which often overflows the two banks, making bridge construction particularly difficult. The flood of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) was even more severe, with more than 20 floods of various sizes. Often, overnight, the water level would rise seven or eight feet, making it impossible to predict. Therefore, the work done today would be washed away by the next morning, leaving nothing but sighs to the rushing river. In addition, the piles used for damming were mostly wooden planks due to economic constraints, with only a few steel sheet piles, and they were old goods purchased from the Yangtze River Ferry project in the capital. In the autumn of the 23rd year, just as the two sides of the steel sheet piles were installed, they were completely washed away by the flood. Thus, all the work was wasted, and we had to start again. This is the general situation of the construction difficulties of the bridge. Section Chief Wu said, "This bridge has gone through all kinds of hardships, which cannot be described in a word. Now we are working day and night. The pier project will be completed in four days. As for laying the sleepers and tracks, it will take a short time. At the latest, by early April, we can directly cross the bridge from Zhuzhou and move forward." The Mi River Bridge has already been completed, and the Lei River Bridge will be completed by early April. Therefore, the entire line will be open to traffic by the end of May without any problem. The abutment project of the Lu Bridge was contracted by Dong Ziji, and the bridge erection project was contracted by the Shanghai Xinzhong Company. I visited the bridge for a long time, and it was already night. We returned to the Seventh General Section office by hand-cranked car for a rest. The day's activities came to an end here. After dinner, I recorded this by kerosene lamp until midnight. Tomorrow morning, I will continue to take the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Bureau's engineering vehicle to Hengshan. (Late night on March 4th in Lukou)</p>

<p>Business Report for the 24th Year of the Republic</p>
<p>The company's business report for the 24th year of the Republic stated: "Our company has only been in operation for a year and a half. Looking at the domestic and international economic and financial situation, we know that simply relying on existing resources is not enough to achieve our goals. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, we set a policy to consolidate our own foundation internally and establish a good reputation externally, in order to promote Sino-foreign cooperation and develop domestic construction. Over the past year, we have done our best. With the joint cooperation of government agencies and the financial and industrial sectors at home and abroad, we have made great contributions to various construction projects. Some have been successfully completed, while others are in the design and negotiation stage. There are still many more, and we hope to gradually realize them in the 25th year of the Republic. The final accounts for the 24th year show a total profit of 1,376,751 yuan, one jiao, and seven fen for the entire year. The total operating expenses for the year were 164,773 yuan, four jiao, and four fen. The net profit after deducting expenses was 1,211,977 yuan, seven jiao, and three fen. After deducting one-tenth for the public reserve fund, paying shareholders a regular dividend of 7%, and a bonus of 3.5%, the remaining amount will be used as retained earnings for this year. This is a general overview of the business operations over the past year, which should be gratifying to the shareholders. Now is the time of currency reform and economic recovery. Our company's reputation has been established at home and abroad. We hope that the financial and industrial sectors will continue to cooperate with the same spirit as in the past, so that domestic construction projects can progress and succeed one by one. This is our company's greatest hope for the future. Detailed figures for the final accounts for the 24th year and the profit distribution plan are detailed in separate statements, which we hope you will examine."</p>

<p>No Increase in Shareholders</p>
<p>After the meeting, according to General Manager Song Ziliang's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, the report that the company would increase its capital by 50 million yuan was inaccurate. The establishment of a real estate mortgage bank was only due to instructions from the Ministry of Finance to draft measures, which are currently being prepared for submission to the Ministry of Finance for approval to establish the bank. However, the bank has no relationship with China Construction Bank Corporation and will be independently established by the Ministry of Finance. Whether its capital will be allocated by the government or jointly operated by attracting merchant shares has not yet been determined, but it is heard that bonds will be issued to supplement the capital.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held its sixth standing committee meeting and seventh executive committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at its office on Hong Kong Road. Committee members Wu Yunzhai, Qi Yunqing, Zhang Peishen, Wang Yansong, Qu Jigang, Wu Weiru, Pan Jiufen, Hu Xi'an, Li Fusun, Du Yuesheng, Hu Mengjia, and others attended. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou was present. As Chairman Chen Guangfu had gone to Beijing and had not returned, Wu Yunzhai was temporarily elected as chairman, and Gu Chengan recorded the minutes. After the usual formalities, the chairman first reported on the resolutions of the previous meeting, and then the discussion began.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The case of China-France Industrial and Commercial Bank requesting to replace its member representative was approved. The case of organizing a bank bill acceptance house was resolved to be entrusted to the United Preparation Committee for organization and handling. The Money Shop Association drafted a memorial for the dispute over the mortgage of Jin Xing Real Estate Company, requesting deliberation and agreement. It was resolved to agree. The small group committee researched the issue of interest rate reduction, drafted a report, and submitted it for review. It was resolved to negotiate with the Money Shop Association and then report back to the Ministry of Finance. It was proposed that the exchange of unified public bonds by banks for custodial accounts should be announced by the association with a consistent method to simplify the process. It was resolved that the banks in the association would jointly announce the exchange method. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Exchange Method</p>
<p>The reporter of Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association yesterday. According to him, the issue of banks exchanging unified public bonds for bonds held in custody or mortgage has been submitted to the executive committee of the association for approval. The method of exchange by banks on behalf of customers will be announced by the association. The method is roughly the same as that of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The methods of the two banks are recorded as follows: 1. For the convenience of those entrusting the bank for custody, all bonds in custody will be exchanged for new bonds by the bank on their behalf. 2. Those entrusting the bank for custody who do not need to entrust the bank for exchange but want to exchange on their own must notify the bank before March 5. If they do not notify within the time limit, they will be deemed to have entrusted the bank for exchange and will be handled in accordance with the first article. 3. If the balance of the remaining principal of each type of old bond is less than 10 yuan, it should be calculated at 98% in national currency to make up 10 yuan. 4. The bank's previous bond custody receipt should be exchanged for a new public bond custody receipt at the bank two weeks after the exchange date specified by the Ministry of Finance for various bonds. The original seal must be brought for verification when exchanging the receipt. In the future, principal and interest will be collected with the new custody receipt. 5. If customers who entrust the bank do not come to exchange for the new custody receipt after the deadline, the names of the bonds listed on the old custody receipt will be invalid. The bank will store the new public bonds to be exchanged in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. Because these new public bonds are subject to lottery, it is hoped that they will come to the bank to exchange for new custody receipts as soon as possible to avoid losing the right to the new public bond lottery. Please pay special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Reduced Imports of Foreign Rice, Shanghai Rice Merchants Mostly Unprepared to Order from Overseas, Expected to Decrease by at Least One-Third This Year <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the production and sales of rice, government officials and grain merchants have been striving to improve the situation in recent years, in order to stop the leakage of foreign rice imports every year. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed a prominent grain merchant yesterday, who said that since last year, imports of foreign rice have decreased compared to previous years. The autumn harvest in various rice-producing areas last year was still abundant, and the government has continued to pay close attention to grain storage this year. Since the beginning of this year, although the poor economic situation has prevented large households from absorbing and hoarding, and rice prices have not been strong, rice is still a necessity, and the average annual sales volume has not fluctuated much. Because there is no shortage of rice produced last year, rice merchants in Shanghai, based on the situation in previous years, would have rushed to order foreign rice from foreign merchants in order to sell it at a profit. However, this year, rice merchants have not made any preparations for this. In addition to ordering a very small amount of broken rice from Siam, they have not taken any action on rice from places such as Saigon and Rangoon. Therefore, it is expected that imports of foreign rice will decrease by at least one-third this year.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Chinese Tea, Packaging Needs Urgent Improvement, British Government Plans to Prohibit Imports, Foreign Firms Greatly Alarmed <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Since the overproduction and plummeting prices of tea in the world, tea merchants in India, Ceylon, the Dutch East Indies, and other countries have implemented export restriction agreements. The export quantity of Indian and Dutch tea has decreased, and the market price has slightly recovered. However, the export of low-grade black tea from China and Japan has increased. For example, the export of black tea from Hunan and Hubei in China has increased significantly compared to before 1932. This is because the selling price is indeed cheaper than Indian and Dutch tea of the same grade. The effectiveness of the export restriction agreements of Indian and Dutch tea merchants has inevitably been greatly affected. Recently, there have been rumors in the London tea market citing the poor packaging of Chinese tea boxes. The purpose of this is self-evident. However, in order to protect the industry of its colonies, the British government has been incited and may issue an order prohibiting the import of substandard tea boxes at any time. Therefore, British merchants engaged in the export of Chinese tea are generally alarmed. Mr. Lacklan, a well-known tea technician at the London headquarters of Jardine Matheson, sent a long letter to Shanghai, urging them to quickly take necessary measures to avoid unexpected losses. The manager of Jardine Matheson's Shanghai office immediately wrote to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, asking them to find ways to improve the packaging of Chinese tea boxes, and the language was extremely sincere. It is said that the bureau has paid close attention to the inspection of tea box packaging. Before the start of the tea season last year, it had already published a notice in the newspaper, urging tea merchants in the interior to actively improve. This year, it has revised three articles of the tea box crackdown measures with the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, including: 1. Four wooden strips must be added to each of the four corners and upper and lower edges inside the box, a total of twelve strips, to increase the support of the tea box. 2. Clean paper must be used on the inner wall of the lead foil to properly paste it, so that the tea leaves and the lead foil are completely isolated. 3. The type of tea, trademark, (main items) number of pieces, gross weight, and net weight (new system), time of picking and making, tea plantation number, and location must be noted on the outside of the box. Once approved by the Ministry of Industry, it can be strictly implemented after the new tea is on the market. In addition, the bureau, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, has also issued a notice to all export tea merchants to cooperate jointly. In order to encourage tea merchants in the interior to improve automatically, all old regulations on "packaging" and "repairing boxes" must be waived for those who can improve the tea box packaging in accordance with the above methods. At the same time, after the tea boxes are strengthened, leaks and shortages of weight can be reduced, and the aroma and quality will not be reduced. If the old-fashioned and inferior packaging from the past is still used, it must be repackaged before it can be exported, and all repackaging costs must be borne by the original manufacturer. After the reporter went to the bureau to inspect the new and sturdy improved tea boxes, the degree of firmness seemed to be indeed different from the old-fashioned tea boxes. Moreover, only twelve more wooden strips need to be nailed during the improvement, which costs very little and is indeed an essential plan for improving tea at present. The bureau has taken clear photos for reference by tea merchants in remote areas. It is said that tea merchants send letters to the bureau to request them for imitation almost every day.</p>

<h3 id="e104">New Office of the Northern Station of the Two-Roads Administration Held Groundbreaking Ceremony Yesterday, Ten-Story Building Costs 700,000 Yuan, Invested and Built by the Roads Savings Association <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The office of the Jinghu-Huhangyong Roads Administration was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. Although it was repaired, it was still insufficient for use. Nearby houses were rented to serve as offices, but the rent burden was heavy, and it was inconvenient to contact business when various departments were scattered. Therefore, with the consent of the Administration's Endowment Reserve Fund Management Committee and the approval of the Ministry of Railways, 700,000 yuan was invested to build a ten-story building in the North Station. The design had already been finalized, and construction was started. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. The ceremony was very simple. In addition to the director, deputy director, and department heads of the Administration, Davison, the representative of the China-British Bank Corporation, Pu Dengqing, the representative of the Endowment Reserve Fund Management Committee, Chen Chengshi, the representative of the Two-Roads Party Department, Zhao Jue, the representative of the Two-Roads Labor Union, and more than 100 others attended. Director Huang presided over the ceremony and reported. After a speech by the representative of the China-British Bank Corporation, the groundbreaking ceremony was held. The events are recorded below.</p>
<p>Meeting Place Set Up in North Station</p>
<p>The office building of the Administration is located on the east side of the North Station. The foundation engineering has been completed, and wooden frames are being built to carry out the construction on the ground. Yesterday, a thatched shed was specially built at the main entrance of the building for the groundbreaking ceremony. The cornerstone was covered with the national flag, and the stone surface was engraved with the words "The Office of the Jinghu-Huhangyong Roads Administration was destroyed in the January 28th Incident in the 21st year of the Republic of China, and the groundbreaking ceremony for reconstruction was held on March 7th in the 25th year of the Republic of China, Director Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng, Recorded by Shen Enfu." The meeting place was set up in the conference room on the second floor of the North Station. The party and national flags were hung at the station entrance, and many road police were dispatched to be stationed there. At 2:00 PM, the representatives arrived at the meeting and the ceremony began.</p>

<p>Director Huang's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman and Director Huang delivered a speech, saying that after the office of the Two Roads Administration was destroyed in the January 28th Incident in the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was unavoidable to borrow four offices in the public concession. However, the rent was extremely expensive, so the situation of each department being cramped was unbearable, and when there were places that should be contacted, it was inconvenient to travel back and forth. Then, each department gradually concentrated near the North Station, and the office space was divided into six places, but the annual rental expenses were nearly 70,000 yuan. If the house was rented for ten years, 700,000 yuan would be spent. Therefore, when each office moved, it planned to build its own office, but only because it did not have the financial resources for a while, it first built the vehicle department and the Shangbei Station office building at the site of the Administration's old office for more than 50,000 yuan. On the one hand, it negotiated with the Timber Road Endowment Reserve Management Committee to fund the construction of a suitable office building and sell it to the Administration. Fortunately, the members of the Endowment Committee enthusiastically supported it, and the Ministry of Railways approved it and decided to build a building worth 700,000 yuan and auxiliary houses with various electrical, sanitary, and heating equipment, and sell it to the Administration for use. The Administration will pay the money in installments within ten years. The Administration and the Endowment Committee have a contract with the following important clauses: 1. The office building is set as a formal six floors, plus a canteen, electrical equipment, water tank, and machine room, with a smaller four floors, for a total of ten floors. The location of its auxiliary houses will be notified to the Endowment Committee in writing by the Road Administration and attached to this contract as an attachment. 2. The sale price of the aforementioned buildings, together with interest, shall be amortized by the Road Administration in the form of monthly rent, with a maximum period of ten years, but the Road Administration may pay it off in one lump sum at any time. 3. The investment interest of the aforementioned buildings shall be calculated at an annual rate of six percent during the construction period, and at an annual rate of seven percent when the road administration moves in when the houses are completed. 4. The repayment of principal and interest shall commence in the month when the houses are officially completed and the Road Administration moves in to work. 5. The interest on the construction funds shall be calculated from the date of each payment to ensure fairness. The interest that is not due at the time of repayment of the principal shall be settled in one lump sum when the houses are completed and the Road Administration moves in, and shall be included as the principal of the construction funds. 6. Before the principal and interest of the construction funds are paid off, the aforementioned buildings shall still be owned by the Endowment Committee. 7. All taxes, insurance premiums, and regular repair fees for the office buildings and auxiliary houses shall be borne by the Road Administration. It should also be reported here that the Endowment Committee has funded the construction of the police fourth section office of the Xihu section on the early bridge. The bidding has been started for construction. This house is the auxiliary house in the contract, and the expenses are also paid within the 700,000 yuan. Moreover, with the efforts of all parties, the total completion in the future may be less than 700,000 yuan, and after ten years, the Administration will get a building and auxiliary houses, which is more cost-effective than renting houses in the concession and paying large rents every year without getting anything in the end. Compared to the Two Roads Administration, this investment is the safest and has no unexpected losses. Therefore, this move can be said to be in the interests of both parties, but I still represent the Administration to express my gratitude to the members, directors, consultants, and architects of the Endowment Committee. After the completion of the new office, the spirit of the colleagues will also be renewed, and today's groundbreaking ceremony is a commemorative ceremony for the beginning of a new life for the colleagues of the Administration.

<p>Then, Davison, the representative of the China-British Bank Corporation, gave a speech, saying that he was very honored to participate in the ceremony, but he was not prepared to speak, so he had no opinions to express, but he expressed his congratulations on the new construction of the Road Administration and wished the road affairs would become more and more developed. It was decided that Pu Dengqing, the representative of the Endowment Reserve Fund Management Committee, would give a speech, saying that the Two Roads Endowment Reserve Fund Association has been established for more than ten years, and the stored funds have reached millions of yuan. It has always stored funds in banks and purchased public bonds and stocks, etc., as safe investments. Now that the Road Administration is building its own building and lacks cash, it has agreed to invest 700,000 yuan to engage in construction. The society has obtained a safe investment, and the Road Administration can also obtain a dog building after ten years, which is a win-win situation. After the speech, the groundbreaking ceremony was held in front of the new building. Director Huang put the commemorative copper box under the cornerstone, added cement to solidify the seal, and then announced the completion of the ceremony, took photos, and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e105">This City's Women's Association to Commemorate "March 8th" Today; Rural Area Propaganda and Guan Bo Speech; Jointly Held by Seven Women's Organizations <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Today is International Women's Day. To awaken rural women from their state of ignorance, this city's Women's Association, with all its directors, will personally set out to various places with obstructed transportation and backward education to conduct extensive and universal propaganda. They have also invited Mayor Wu's wife, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Ms. Shu Huizhen, and others to broadcast the significance of March 8th and to issue "A Declaration to Women on International Women's Day" on the Greater China Asia Sound Radio Station. The original text is recorded below: "Dear sisters, 'March 8th' is a day for international women to jointly seek their own liberation. Therefore, until the women's masses have achieved complete liberation, it should have great commemorative significance. Although women in Western countries have obtained many rights and opportunities equal to men on the surface since the 19th century, the consequences of the World War have ultimately led to misfortune, which has intensified. Therefore, after the European War, all countries, both economically and socially, have fallen into extreme panic and chaos. Imperialists, in order to make up for their losses in the war and restore their dreamed-of inherent prosperity, have had to intensify their oppression and exploitation of women. At the same time, because of the extreme preparation for the second great massacre, they have had to use the pretext of 'preserving the race' to drive women to exhaust themselves in production and supply new materials for the battlefield. Today, women have become one of the targets of the world's reactionary trends. To escape trampling and not become victims of the countercurrent, we can only continue the spirit of March 8th and strive forward. As for our country, gender equality, although clearly stated in the party program and recorded in the laws, when examining the reality, the so-called political and legal equality is nothing more than a blank sheet of paper, and the so-called social and economic equality is even more of an elusive illusion. The same moral law does not apply to both men and women, and the scope of women's occupations is shrinking day by day. All these facts prove that the liberation of Chinese women is still far away, and the nominal equality between men and women is due to this. Unless we are content with the status quo and willingly be the former slaves of men, we should follow in the footsteps of the fighting paths of our predecessors and strive bravely forward. Since 'September 18th' to this day, China has been fragmented, the countryside has gone bankrupt, and internal and external troubles have become increasingly serious. In other words, the fate of the Chinese nation is on the verge of survival. Women cannot exist independently of the nation, nor can they seek their own solutions independently of the issue of national survival. Therefore, Chinese women, in addition to fighting for their own liberation, should also strive for national liberation. 'March 8th' is a day for international women to jointly seek liberation. In the eyes of women who have already been liberated, it is good news, and their formal commemoration is naturally a celebration. However, in the eyes of Chinese women under internal and external troubles, it can only be a warning sign, and the expression that comes with this warning sign is the spirit of going to war and the determination to resist. Sisters, rise up together, unite closely, continue the spirit of the fighting of the enlightened, shoulder the unfinished mission of our predecessors, and promote women's liberation, human equality, and world peace."</p>
<p>Furthermore, seven organizations, including the China Women's Movement League, the China Women's Temperance Association, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, the China Women's Society, the Chinese Women's Association, the Bee Society, and the Shanghai Women's National Salvation Association, have scheduled a joint commemorative conference at the Sichuan Road YMCA at 2:00 PM today. Ms. Wang Canzhi, He Xiangning, Wang Xiaoying, Shi Liang, Liu Wang Liming, Lei Sai, and other prominent women figures will give speeches. The presidium consists of seven people: Chen Lingyi, Wang Ruizhu, Zhang Manyun, Bu Zhenhua, Xie Zuyi, Shi Liang, and Zhang Zhixue. Staff members from each organization will be assigned to serve as receptionists, security, recorders, masters of ceremonies, and other duties. Women from all walks of life are welcome to attend.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the eighty-sixth birthday of Dr. Masaryk, the former president of Czechoslovakia. The Czech Embassy in Shanghai took a day off, and other Czech officials and civilians in various organizations also expressed their congratulations.

<h3 id="e107">Market Stability, Business Activity; Various Banks Sequentially Return Loans; Bank of China Implements Interbank Collateral Lending; Promotes Bills and Expands Rural Lending <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new currency system policy, the market is stable and various industries are active. The Bank of China's adjustment of interbank collateral lending has been implemented, and money shops have been sequentially returning loans to the three banks. Efforts are being made to promote acceptance bills, and various banks and shops are making every effort to expand rural lending. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing Collateral Loans for Various Shops</p>
<p>The Bank of China, in order to regulate interbank finance and organize collateral loans for various shops, has implemented the measures after consultation between the bank's general manager, Song Hanzhang, and money industry leaders Qin Runqing, He Zhongxiao, and others. Any money shop can mortgage valuable goods and bonds to the bank for cash at about 70% of the market price, with a particularly low monthly interest rate. Generally, each shop is limited to 200,000 national currency. Those with receipts and payments of more than 10 million yuan can obtain the bank's consent for a limit of 500,000 national currency, indirectly providing relief to industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Money Shops Return Loans</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds last year to rescue the money industry, and a Money Industry Supervision Committee was established to manage it. In addition to the 7 million yuan from various commercial banks and the money industry reserve, which has already been repaid, the 18 million yuan from the three banks of China, Central, and Communications, with the permission of the Ministry of Finance and the three banks, has been extended to the end of the Republic of China year 24 before being returned. Now, the various money shops that borrowed the money, since using legal tender, have increased their chips, and various industries have gradually become active. Therefore, they have been sequentially returning the loans from the three banks.</p>
<p>Promoting Bill Acceptance</p>
<p>The member banks and money shops of the Banking and Money Industry Association, in view of the decline in the market last year and the difficulty in lending, have been forced to tighten up this year and be particularly cautious about various loans. Now, since the implementation of the new currency system policy, the market has seen an increase in chips, and the industry itself has been consolidated. In order to implement the relief of industry and commerce, they are planning to establish a bank and money shop bill acceptance center, promote acceptance bills, and study reducing deposit and loan interest rates to promote industrial and commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>Expanding Rural Lending</p>
<p>Various banks, in view of the urgent task of revitalizing the countryside, the China Agricultural Loan Banking Group, jointly established by the Shanghai, Communications, Zhejiang Xingye, and Xinhua banks, has decided to solicit cooperation from various banks and money shops this year and make every effort to expand. At the same time, the Agricultural Bank of China has received 50 million yuan from the Ministry of Finance to handle rural land lending, and General Manager Xu has drafted detailed measures, which were approved for implementation at yesterday's board meeting. In addition, the Bank of China is also making every effort to expand rural lending.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Zhabei Lumber Merchants Went on Strike Yesterday Morning; Protesting Tax Increases and Arbitrary Arrests; Sent Representatives to Party and Government Agencies to Petition <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>—City Chamber of Commerce Sent Letter Urging Prompt Resumption of Business—</p>
<p>The lumber merchants on Guangfu Road in Zhabei all rent land to build houses. According to usual practice, the property tax is 14% of the assessed value. In the autumn of the Republic of China year 23, the collection office re-evaluated the value, resulting in a tax increase of more than double. In the summer of year 24, it was increased by another one to two times. This spring, it was increased by another one to several times. It was also stipulated that the property tax for years 23 and 24 must be paid according to the new tax amount for year 25. If less was paid in years 23 and 24, a fine of 20% will be imposed. The lumber merchants, with the property tax increasing repeatedly, reaching six or seven times the original amount, have repeatedly objected, but all efforts have been ineffective, resulting in the issue remaining unresolved.</p>
<p>Arbitrary Arrests</p>
<p>Public Indignation</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the lumber merchants on Guangfu Road petitioned the Finance Bureau, stating that they could only pay the tax amount for year 24 at most, and firmly opposed the new measures and penalty regulations for year 25, but received no reply. At 12:00 noon that day, the collection office sent personnel to Fu Tai to collect taxes. Still unable to reach an agreement on the new and old tax amounts, the tax collector took the manager of that company, Chen Hongzhang, to the collection office for a meeting, ordering him to pay in full. When he was unable to comply, he was detained at the Menggu Road Police Station at 6:00 PM. At noon on the 4th, he was transferred to the North Railway Station Branch, and at 1:00 PM, he was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was photographed and fingerprinted. Only after the public office and the trade association intervened and guaranteed his release, was he released, still limited to paying the money within three days. The merchants, because this matter had not been decided by the court and the arbitrary arrest procedures had been delayed, decided to go on strike in response.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning, Industry Issued Strike Notice</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen lumber companies on Guangfu Road, including Yuan Xing at No. 76, Fu Ji at No. 62, Xie Sheng at No. 755, Heng Xiang at No. 999, Fu [blank] at No. 1047, Rui Da at No. [blank] 77, Da Chang at No. 1059, Zi Da at No. 1073, Yuan Shun at No. 1105, Yong Da at No. 691, Da Feng, Xiang Mao, and Xie Mao, all declared a strike. A notice was posted on the door stating, "Due to the detention of Chen Hongzhang, manager of Fu Tai Lumber Company, by the Municipal North Collection Office, the industry is indignant and has voluntarily suspended business to await the decision on the petition."</p>
<p>Sent Representatives to Party and Government to Petition</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen managers from various companies, including Zhang Yunrui, Lu Bingkun, Qu Jisheng, Shen Jingtang, and Chen Mingyuan, accompanied by Wei Shanfu, a representative from the public association, and Xu Zuoliang, a representative from the public office, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Government to petition. Their petition stated, (omitted above) "Now, according to letters from our colleagues Rui Da, Xie Sheng, Yuan Gu, Yuan Yu, Heng Xiang, Zi Da, Fu Ji, Da Chang, Xie Mao, Fu Tai, and other lumber companies, we respectfully state that our lumber industry has been affected by the economic downturn, and business is declining. All expenses have already been reduced with difficulty. How can we bear the burden of a sudden and huge increase in property tax? After investigation, the property tax of the industry was thoroughly investigated in year 22, with no omissions. The industry complied and paid the tax. In year 23, the tax was generally increased to one or more times, which was already a heavy burden. We endured and reluctantly complied, not daring to disobey. However, in the autumn of year 24, it was suddenly increased by one or several times, and the industry is indeed facing the situation of heavy taxes and unbearable burdens. We requested your association to convey our difficulties to the Municipal Finance Bureau again and again, but it was not approved. We are still continuing to request. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, the Municipal North Collection Office led the police to arrest Chen Hongzhang, the manager of Fu Tai Lumber Company, without distinguishing right from wrong, and immediately detained him. At 6:00 PM, he was sent to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District and transferred to the Public Security Bureau. It was not until 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the decision that your association, together with Yuan Shun, Heng Xiang, Rui Da, Xie Sheng, Fu Ji, Zi Da, Da Chang, and Xie Mao lumber companies, bailed him out and ordered him to pay within three days. According to Article 16, Paragraph 1, the last paragraph of the Shanghai Municipal Property Tax Regulations revised in [Year] 24, the regulations for resisting tax are only to summon the case for collection, not to summon the case for detention. The so-called collection has legitimate collection procedures, and illegal detention cannot be abused without legitimate procedures. The laws of the State and the National Government state that the personal freedom of the people must not be arbitrarily arrested, and the violation of the law is undeniable. Let us put this aside and not discuss the individual's right to sue. Now, let us examine Article 5 of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Investigation of Rent Method, which stipulates that the maximum amount of tax to be recovered is one year's tax amount. Now, even according to its unilaterally determined highest limit of 333 yuan and 91 cents for one year's tax amount, the amount to be recovered is 407 yuan and 68 cents, plus a fine of 81 yuan and 54 cents, which is indeed a violation of the regulations. Furthermore, after investigating our colleagues' houses, some of them are self-built, and the property tax should be assessed accordingly. The lumber yard should also be assessed. The assessment was decided twice in years 22 and 23. Even if the previous investigation and assessment were not accurate, they should be submitted to the Housing Evaluation Committee for evaluation in accordance with the regulations. However, without an explicit evaluation, the tax was suddenly increased several times based solely on the investigator's report, which is inevitably arbitrary. Recently, our colleagues have received notices from the collection office to increase the tax amount, and the amount to be supplemented generally exceeds the limit of one year. Due to the sluggish business, we are unable to bear the additional burden. Now, seeing Chen Hongzhang, a legitimate businessman, inevitably suffering oppression, we are all indignant and have voluntarily suspended business. We are specially appealing to your association, requesting immediate relief, negotiating legally, reducing excessive taxes, and correcting the punishment. We are extremely grateful." Based on this, the Shanghai Municipal Property Tax was investigated and estimated twice in years 22 and 23, and there are few omissions, which is true. The arrest of the manager of Fu Tai Lumber Company this time has made our colleagues wary of the collection of taxes, which is regrettable. However, in recent years, the market has declined, and our colleagues are indeed in a difficult situation to maintain. If we supervise and责责 excessively, it is not a way to relieve business difficulties. Now, the industry in that area has unanimously suspended business, and the industry throughout the city is indignant upon hearing of the previous situation, and there is an indication that they will suspend business together. Our association is deeply concerned that the situation will expand and affect the commercial and social order of this city. We believe that the situation is urgent and needs to be resolved quickly. Therefore, we are sending personnel to accompany representatives from the lumber companies to present this letter in person. We should ask for your assistance in dealing with the matter.</p>
<p>The Party Department Orders Immediate Resumption of Business</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city yesterday ordered the Shanghai Lumber Industry Association, "Regarding the illegal arrest and pursuit of property tax by the Municipal North Collection Office and the abuse of detention, the industry in that area has unanimously suspended business, and we earnestly request that you investigate and handle the matter legally. We order you to instruct the various merchants in the industry to resume business and await legal investigation and handling. This order is issued by Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and Tong Hangbai, members of the Standing Committee."</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Advises the Association to Resume Business</p>
<p>The representatives first went to the Municipal Party Department to request (1) a temporary suspension of execution, (2) a re-evaluation of the tax amount, and (3) a guarantee that the same situation will not occur in the future. Zhu Yangwu of the Civil Movement Section met with them and advised the representatives to resume business first and await legal resolution. They then went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where Yuan Hongjun, a clerk of the Commerce Section, met with them and advised them to resume business first. He then accompanied them to the Municipal Government, where Cen Zixin, a staff member of the Second Section, met with them and replied that he would telegraph the Public Security Bureau to temporarily suspend execution before a resolution was reached. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the Lumber Association authorizing the members to resume business. The original text stated, "We respectfully state that regarding the strike of the industry due to the re-evaluation of property tax, this association has led representatives of the public association to the Shanghai Municipal Government to petition, and the Municipal Government has agreed to investigate and handle the matter and notified the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter of demanding payment within a limited time with leniency. In addition to presenting the dispute over rent evaluation to the Municipal Government, it should be evaluated by the Housing Evaluation Committee to show fairness and thoroughly investigate the illegal actions of the collection office. On the one hand, we should advise the members in Zhabei to resume business as usual and await resolution. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<h3 id="e112">After the Implementation of the New Telephone Regulations, All Sectors are Taking Countermeasures; Letters Request Various Industries to Calculate Losses; Jointly Use the Basic Fee; Willing to Dismantle and Hire Workers to Relay <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Application Society stated that the Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking it to instruct the various industry associations to calculate the losses suffered by the telephone service this month in order to provide a basis for negotiations, and scheduled the fourth regular meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss further protest measures. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Statistics of Losses</p>
<p>The Telephone Problem Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, since the implementation of the Shanghai Telephone Company's new charging regulations, the losses suffered by citizens have been quite large. In the autumn of commercial depression and social and economic collapse, the company only considers its own interests and does everything possible to exploit, which is hateful. Your association has repeatedly protested against this issue, and although it has failed to achieve the desired goal, it can also express the public's concerns. Now that the company's new regulations have been implemented, the losses suffered by the citizens should be clearly calculated in order to provide a basis for petitioning the government to take it back and run it independently. Your association is the general organization for all Shanghai businesses and strives to relieve the suffering of businessmen. Therefore, we specially request that you instruct the various industry associations to register the number of telephone fees paid starting in March and submit them to our association by April 10th. This matter concerns public welfare, and we hope you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>Saving Method</p>
<p>Committee member Zheng AoKui suggested a method to save telephone charges for traffic relief, stating, "Respectfully, each telephone set must bear a basic telephone charge, as much as 5 yuan and 5 jiao for stores and 3 yuan and 5 jiao for residences. If there are ten telephone sets in a certain lane, removing nine sets and reducing the installation to one set can save 35 yuan and 1 jiao in basic fees. Reducing the installation to one set for ten stores can save even more, 49 yuan and 5 jiao in basic fees. With this expense, specially hiring telephone operators will be more than sufficient, and even if each call costs three cents, it can be saved without exception. Compared to sacrificing to the telephone company for no reason, it is still a method in a situation where there is no method," etc. After receiving the letter, it is heard that the association will forward the letter to notify users to uniformly follow the method.</p>
<p>Willing to Dismantle</p>
<p>Telephone is a public utility, which has a great impact on the prosperity of commerce. The municipal authorities should consider how to promote the development of commerce in order to coexist and prosper. Now, the Public Works Department ignores the economic downturn and rashly allows the Shanghai Telephone Company to implement the new regulations, collecting charges according to the number of calls and increasing the burden on citizens in order to satisfy its monopolistic ambition and fulfill its desires. Now, the members of this association are willing to dismantle them all in order to adopt effective methods and actively resist, and to serve as a backing for your association. Because such expensive telephone charges, calculated at 20 calls per day, cost about 8 jiao, which amounts to more than 20 yuan per month. It is better to hire manual relay to save money, which can not only relieve unemployment but also resist it. We hereby submit this suggestion and hope that you will adopt it.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Lu Bohong Returns to Shanghai to Report on the Shandong Disaster; Proposes Three Relief Measures <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The China and Foreign Relief Society on Renji Road believes that although the Shandong flood disaster has carried out emergency winter relief, the situation in the spring is still severe. The society has requested Director Lu Bohong to go to investigate and determine the spring relief policy. According to his return report, the disaster area in Shandong Province occupies a thousand square miles. Taking only a part of agricultural production, the losses are 26 million yuan. So far, the accumulated water is one or two feet deep, and boats cannot travel, making progress more difficult than before. At least three months of work is needed to solve the problem of closing the mouth of the breach. The original shelters have been maintained for seven months. Due to insufficient funds, in addition to returning the remaining people, there are still 300,000 people who are extremely destitute, and no less than 500,000 people remain in the flooded area. All the accumulated food and all those who can find a way to survive have been exhausted. The seven temporary hospitals established in the disaster area require 5,000 yuan per month to provide relief to sick refugees. The doctors, nurses, and others are all male and female missionaries volunteering, etc. Three relief measures are proposed as follows: Spring relief should be divided into emergency relief and agricultural relief. First, provide relief to the counties with the most severe disasters, and emergency relief should be limited to those who are extremely poor and unable to live. Agricultural relief should focus on the spring plowing problem in the disaster area, such as agricultural tools and seeds. Fundraising should be done in cooperation with the mountain government and various charitable organizations. Since the shelters have not yet been closed and the disaster area has not yet recovered, the hospitals should continue to operate for another two months until the end of May. It is proposed to provide loans to cooperative societies and to use work as relief for the victims, such as the Juye Chenggong and Zhukou Xiangong projects, etc., which are all suitable for work relief methods. It is heard that the association has scheduled a board meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss everything.</p>
<h3 id="e116">This City Will Report Smokers: Forced Registration of Smokers; License Renewal Begins April 1st; All Staff in Government and Organizations Must Be Cleared by a Deadline <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been rigorously promoting anti-smoking efforts in this city, the number of smokers has gradually decreased. Regarding registered smokers, formal licenses will be renewed starting April 1st. As for the procedures for reporting smokers in this city, they will be implemented as soon as the anti-smoking headquarters issues the regulations to Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>License Renewal to Start on April 1st</p>
<p>Smokers in this city were originally required to renew their licenses every six months. Licenses obtained during the voluntary registration period were valid from September 1st, 1935, to the end of February 1936. Licenses obtained during the mandatory registration period were valid from October 1st, 1935, to the end of March. However, many smokers have been negligent during the renewal period, resulting in inconsistencies. Therefore, to ensure strict enforcement, all licenses, whether obtained voluntarily or mandatorily, will be renewed starting April 1st. Notices will be posted in various districts on the date of the announcement to inform the public.</p>
<p>Smoker Reporting; Orders Not Yet Received</p>
<p>To ensure smokers quit within a specified period, the anti-smoking headquarters convened the first standing committee meeting of the anti-smoking association to discuss practical solutions. Fourteen articles on methods for reporting smokers were specifically drafted and circulated to all provinces and cities for implementation. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency visited Dai, the section chief of the Fourth Anti-Smoking Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to inquire about the progress of implementing smoker reporting in this city. According to the response, although the anti-smoking headquarters has established regulations on reporting smokers, the official documents and methods have not yet been received. The bureau will implement them as soon as the regulations are issued.</p>
<p>Government Employees; Clearance by Deadline</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau implemented anti-smoking efforts in this city, in addition to conducting voluntary and mandatory registration procedures for all smokers, all personnel in government agencies who are addicted to smoking, as well as staff in public organizations, will be strictly cleared after the reporting methods are announced. Those who conceal their addiction will be dismissed from their positions and punished according to the law if discovered.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Honors for the Loving Care for Children Association: International Home Education Exhibition Medal; Transferred by Our Embassy in Belgium <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>From July 31st to August 4th last year, the International Society for Home Education held the Fifth International Home Education Conference in Brussels, Belgium, with more than 200 representatives from 47 countries attending. The Chinese government representatives were Ling Qihan and Wang Xie. The China Loving Care for Children Association considered the conference to be of great significance and selected Ms. Ding Shujing to bring Chinese home education products to participate in the meeting. All conference proceedings have been disclosed. It is now known that Ms. Ding Shujing, representative of the China Loving Care for Children Association, has also received an International Home Education Exhibition Medal transferred by our embassy in Belgium, which was awarded to the China Loving Care for Children Association. The embassy's letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, according to a letter from the International Society for Home Education in Brussels, this society held an International Home Education Exhibition at the Brussels exhibition hall from July 31st to August 4th, 1935. After evaluation by the committee, it was decided to award a medal to the China Loving Care for Children Association to express Belgium's recognition of Chinese academics and organizations, which is even more evident. I respectfully ask His Excellency the Minister to transfer the medal to Ms. Ding Shujing, the representative of your association, which is greatly appreciated, etc. Accordingly, the medal is sent by separate mail for your inspection and receipt, and hope to see a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Central Party Headquarters; Supervisory Committee to Build Office Building; Contracted to Shanghai Fuqi Construction Company <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The new office building of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Party Headquarters is modeled after the Party History and Historical Materials Exhibition Hall. Because the Exhibition Hall was built by Tao Guilin of Shanghai Fuqi Construction Company with excellent results, it was decided that the office building would not be put out to tender and was directly contracted to Fuqi by the host Chairman Lin and others. Preparations for construction have already begun, and it is heard that the groundbreaking ceremony will be held on the 29th of this month. In general, it ranks eleventh. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Denmark is very safe. The rate in cities is 6.3 per 10,000 people, and the rate for the entire country is 7.5. Statistics for the whole of Russia are inconsistent. Currently, the tuberculosis mortality rate among the Russian ethnic group is higher than that of other ethnic groups within the Soviet Union. It is lower in eastern Siberia. Tuberculosis statistics in North America show that the peak in mortality is closely related to population density. At the beginning of this century, tuberculosis mortality ranked first among all causes of death in the United States, but now it has fallen to sixth place. It is even lower in Michigan than in the southern states. In Cleveland, in 1930, there were only 8.3 deaths per 10,000 residents. The reduction in mortality is not as great among people of color. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Mexico has also decreased in recent years. Tuberculosis mortality rates in South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil are high due to poor public health. In the Philippines, the tuberculosis mortality rate was 30.55 per 10,000 residents in 1930. The situation in Japan and China is similar to the above-mentioned regions, but it should be noted that mortality rates vary within each region. Tuberculosis is less common in northern and western China, while tuberculosis transmission is more common in central and southern China. In the last hundred years, most black people have migrated to the Americas and become part of the Sklaraki race. Statistics for the United States of America show that the mortality rate is 7.2 per 10,000 residents for whites and 23.2 for people of color, which is more than three times higher than that of whites. Tuberculosis specialists call this racial susceptibility. Statistics for 45 major cities in the United States show that the mortality rate has decreased significantly, averaging 8.23 per 10,000 people. Chicago has only 6.6. However, the mortality rate for black people is still ten percent. The reasons for these racial differences are difficult to resolve, but the general situation is, of course, also related. The situation with tuberculosis in "rural areas" is demonstrated by a report from the League of Nations' International Health Bureau, which shows the highest tuberculosis mortality rates in less developed agricultural areas. However, most scholars still believe that tuberculosis transmission is, on average, lower in rural areas. It is most noteworthy that people who move from rural areas to cities are more likely to experience severe disease changes within the first two years, especially young people. The relationship between tuberculosis mortality and "age," according to German statistics, is almost equal between the sexes between the ages of 30 and 70. Between the ages of 5 and 30, the rate is higher for women than for men. The mortality rate for school-age children has also been gradually declining. It is important to note that new infections are more common among girls than boys in schools, which also proves that tuberculosis transmission does not occur very early in childhood, but at a later age. The most important reasons for reducing transmission are improvements in school facilities and immediate isolation after the discovery of the disease. Recent studies on the transmission of tuberculosis among school-age children show that most infections occur within the family, with very few cases occurring in schools. In large-scale examinations, tuberculosis is found in one to three percent of university students, and there is also a tendency for active tuberculosis to increase. Regarding the relationship between occupation and tuberculosis, nurses and doctors are, of course, the most susceptible to infection. This particular occupation is more dangerous than others. Those who inhale large amounts of dust, such as shoemakers and sewers, also have higher infection rates. In northern Italy, it was found that 1 percent of residents over the age of 60 with tuberculosis have open tuberculosis. According to German statistics on open tuberculosis, the number should be multiplied by at least three times the annual mortality statistics. If the 1932 German mortality rate of 7.5 per 100,000 people is multiplied by three, it becomes 22.5, which, based on the country's population, is 146,250 people. The average life expectancy of these patients with open tuberculosis is three years, which is a major cause of transmission to family members. The case of "tuberculosis among couples" is also noteworthy. Male patients often infect their healthy wives, because women often have pregnancy and childbirth, or because they try their best to take care of their husbands, which makes them more susceptible to infection. However, tuberculosis among couples is not as terrible as one might imagine, because married people are mostly past the most dangerous period of susceptibility. Recent world literature and statistics show that countries such as England and the United States have achieved very satisfactory results in tuberculosis prevention, with only 7 or 8 deaths per 10,000 people. France and Switzerland have also made great efforts in tuberculosis prevention, but still have higher mortality rates. In short, tuberculosis transmission is still very severe in various countries. Without adequate financial resources, the success of tuberculosis prevention will be difficult. What we must pay urgent attention to in the future is the organization methods of "unemployment insurance" and "health insurance," which are the greatest driving forces for reducing tuberculosis mortality. Looking at the success of tuberculosis prevention in various countries, this is the only way. After Ding finished speaking, the newest film from the American Kodak Company was screened until after 9 o'clock, and the audience dispersed happily.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Recent Overview of Tuberculosis in Various Countries; Lecture by Dr. Ding Huikang <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai, went to Europe years ago to investigate the latest tuberculosis prevention facilities in various countries and returned to China last month, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, at the invitation of the Shiqiu Chinese Student Association, he gave a lecture at the association on "Recent Overview of Tuberculosis in Various Countries." More than 200 people attended, including members of the association, professors and students from various universities in Shanghai. First, Chairman Zhu Shaoping gave a speech, followed by a lecture by Dr. Ding, which mainly said that if we want to prevent the occurrence of a disease, we must not only study the causes, but also pay attention to the disease's growth, decline, historical changes, and its relationship to human geography. In the industrial areas of European countries, due to the gradual improvement of their sanitation facilities, the tuberculosis mortality rate has also gradually decreased. In Germany, the number of deaths per 10,000 residents has decreased from 12 to 7.5. The reason is due to the public insurance organization and the progress of public health. In the most recent century, Norway maintained the lowest number of tuberculosis mortality rates, with Denmark being the lowest in 1910, and the Netherlands having a lower mortality rate than Norway in 1920. After the war, the statistics for Switzerland, England, Sweden, and Germany showed that their mortality rates all decreased. Recent observations show that Germany has a lower tuberculosis mortality rate than other countries, making it the country with the least tuberculosis mortality rate in Europe and the world. Tuberculosis calculations in Canada are very high, with a mortality rate seven and a half times higher than that of other people. In British Australia, the age of tuberculosis transmission is very late. The tuberculosis situation in India is relatively poor, with a very high mortality rate, with 30 deaths per 10,000 people per year. In Italy, due to the density of residents in cities, the lack of squares and gardens, and the smallness of most workshops, there are major causes of tuberculosis transmission. In Northern European countries such as the Netherlands, the number of annual deaths is less than the number of beds in the country's hospitals. In countries such as England, the United States, and Germany, the number of deaths and the number of hospital beds are almost the same. In France, there are two deaths for every hospital bed. In Italy, there are five deaths for every hospital bed. The number of deaths has been decreasing since 1925, until 1930, tuberculosis statistics have decreased by 32%. The government that implemented tuberculosis prevention work in Italy was the fascist government, which implemented mandatory tuberculosis insurance, and the results were very good. The tuberculosis mortality rate in France is also relatively high. Although the organization of the current "tuberculosis prevention network" is very complete, the results are not very satisfactory. In general, the tuberculosis mortality rate in Europe is the highest in France. The mortality rate in Belgium is very safe. In Switzerland, the tuberculosis mortality rate has not decreased much compared to its total mortality rate, and is higher than that of other European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Ireland, and Finland. The age of death is mostly during childhood. The tuberculosis mortality rates in Southern European countries such as Romania and Greece are high. The climate in Hungary is harsh, and the construction of houses is very difficult, so tuberculosis in that country can be called a residential disease. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Northern Europe is relatively safe, such as in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Norway has also decreased. In 1929, there were 15.6 deaths per 10,000 residents. Compared with civilized countries,</p>

<p>Xu Xueseng, a native of Songjiang and former magistrate of a certain county in Gansu, is 45 years old and lives at 9 Dongmingde Lane, Marang Road, French Concession. On the afternoon of the 6th of last month, at 5 p.m., he went to the Xinxin Bathhouse on Baer Road with his friends Xiao Ronggen and Fu, and two others. At about 8 p.m., as he walked out and passed in front of 26 Wangzhi Road, from east to west, a thug suddenly drove a motorcar, approaching from west to east. He suddenly poured a glass bottle full of corrosive acid on Xu's face. Xu was unable to dodge in time, and his face was burned and he fell to the ground. The perpetrator, seeing that his goal had been achieved, tried to escape. Seeing this, Xu's friends immediately stepped forward to restrain the perpetrator, but the perpetrator resisted and tried to escape. Accidentally, he spilled the remaining acid in the bottle on his own face, and was also injured. At this point, he surrendered. Later, detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Zuo Qihong arrived and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Xu Xueseng was seriously injured, and his right eye may be blinded. The perpetrator's injuries were minor, and after bandaging by a Western doctor, he was taken to the police station. The perpetrator confessed that his name was Gao Jinsheng, 25 years old, from Changshu. He was hired by a fugitive named Hou Laosi to douse Xu with acid. Later, the detectives investigated the case and found that a wealthy man named Zhu from the victim's hometown had murdered a beloved concubine last year. The victim knew about this, and the wealthy man feared that the victim would reveal the secret, so he repeatedly tried to put the victim to death. This tragic scene occurred. However, the victim had heard rumors and was wary, so he always went out in Shanghai with friends. He was still victimized. Yesterday, the police sent Gao to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer requested a postponement, and Chief Wang Tingyi approved a postponement for further trial on the 18th. The defendant's injuries were not healed, and he was sent back to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that in order to avoid difficulties, the Ministry of Industry's fish market is said to be operated jointly by officials and merchants. According to a reporter's interview with fish merchants familiar with the Shanghai market, the Ministry of Industry's establishment of the fish market was originally a preliminary step towards controlling the national fishing industry. However, if the Shanghai fish market is operated jointly by officials and merchants, the existing large market at 16 Pu will inevitably have to maintain its current status. As a result, 16 Pu will become a branch market in an informal way. Fish vendors will inevitably flock to 16 Pu due to habit, rather than going to Yangshupu. In addition, the inconvenience of transportation to the fish market is a shortcoming. As a result, the transaction of the main market will be taken away, which will defeat the original intention of the government. It is hoped that the authorities can carefully consider this.</p>

<p>Madam Ye Chen, a resident of Lane 81, No. 690, Dongxi Huade Road, Hongkou, is the concubine of Hu Sheng, the youngest son of the late Ye Chengzhong, who donated funds for education. In her youth, she was a courtesan, known as Lin Xiaoqing, attracting attention with her beauty. She was favored by Ye Hu Sheng, who redeemed her from prostitution in the 34th year of the Guangxu reign of the Xuantong Qing Dynasty and kept her in a residence on Six Ma Road. The following summer, Madam Chen gave birth. Hu Sheng, because his elders had once said that if a son was born, he would be allowed to live together, but if a daughter was born, she would not be allowed to live in the side room, announced at that time the celebration of having a son, and welcomed Madam Chen back. This has been twenty-eight years. Hu Sheng has passed away for more than three years. Recently, a woman, Ye Yueying, has hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and Ma Leming, to file a lawsuit against Ye Chen in the First Special District Court, claiming that the child born by Chen was actually the plaintiff. Because the elders had insisted that Hu Sheng could not take her as a concubine if she gave birth to a daughter, Chen sent the plaintiff to her aunt Ke Shi's house for foster care after the one-month celebration and sought another boy to be a biological son, so as to avoid condemnation from the family. However, the plaintiff has been abandoned by her parents for twenty-eight years. Therefore, she requests that the court order confirmation that the plaintiff is the defendant's biological daughter and that she be paid alimony of fifty yuan per month. After a preliminary hearing, Judge Luo Chongtai held a hearing yesterday afternoon, summoning witnesses and questioning them separately. However, the defendant, Ye Chen, only hired lawyer E Sen to represent her.</p>
<p>He stated that the defendant is currently in Ningbo and cannot attend. Judge Luo first questioned Zhu Ajin, an old woman from Suzhou who was a witness. According to her testimony, in the first year of Xuantong, she worked as a servant in a small house in Renshou Lane on Six Ma Road rented by Ye Hu Sheng. The plaintiff was indeed born to Chen in June of that year. She initially breastfed her until after the full month, when Chen had to return to the old house with Ye, so she sent the girl to her aunt's house for foster care. Then, Chen's sister-in-law, that is, the plaintiff's aunt Ke Shi, testified that Chen was born on June 25th in the first year of Xuantong. After the plaintiff's one-month celebration, she handed the daughter over to the wet nurse she hired for care, and Chen returned home with Ye Hu Sheng. Not long after, she heard that she had given birth to a boy. According to the witness Fang Guizhang, who was invited by the defendant, Chen married Ye and gave birth to a boy named Lianfu in June of the following year. At that time, I lived in the same house as him, so I knew him very well. The midwife was the German doctor Keli and no daughter was born. The court believed that this case must order the defendant to appear in court for confrontation before it can be clarified, so it ordered a change of date to the afternoon of the 18th of this month to summon the defendant to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th of last month, at about 8:00 AM, an unknown peddler, about thirty years old, was selling stationery in front of Chengzhong School on Tangshan Road, carrying a rattan basket. Unexpectedly, Western Policeman No. 132 from the Huishan Police Station arrived in a car and attempted to arrest the peddler. The peddler, fearing arrest, fled to the back door of the Yuda Store at No. 413, Tangshan Road, Yangzhengzhong Lane, into the kitchen. The Western policeman also chased after him. Before long, the peddler suddenly fell in the house, unconscious. He was sent to Tongren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The body was taken to the autopsy site on Feilun Road. The next morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Song Genshan, along with forensic doctors, to the site to examine the body. After questioning witnesses, they ordered an autopsy. The previous report has recorded the circumstances. The autopsy has been completed and determined that the peddler died due to cerebral hemorrhage. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song again visited the autopsy site to inform Philip, the head of the Western police of the Huishan Police Station, of the autopsy process. He then declared that the deceased, an unnamed man, died of cerebral hemorrhage. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last night, Xiao Huaiyu, a detective from the Zhabei Xinzha Detective Squad, received a secret report stating that on the evening of the 4th of this month, at around 7:00 PM, a five-year-old boy from the family of Huang Zhiqing, a copper craftsman residing at No. 57, Hanzhong Road, was kidnapped by bandits. The bandits are currently residing in a thatched shed on Damuqiao, Nanshi. Detective Xiao immediately reported to Deputy Captain Shi and dispatched team leader Li Shouchang, Li Guiqing, detectives Zhong Da, Zhang Shuwen, and Sun Youzhi to the address. They arrested Zhang Wenliang, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, 16 years old, from Funing. Zhang confessed that he kidnapped the Huang surname child from Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, and hid him at No. 24, Taideli, Chihang Bridge, Xinzha Road, in the Public Concession. The officers immediately contacted the Xinzha Police Station that night, sent a car, and rescued the kidnapped boy from behind the living room downstairs at No. 24, Taideli. After taking the team back, they immediately summoned Huang Zhiqing, the family of the lost child, to the team to confirm the identity. The child was immediately taken back by his biological father. Subsequently, the bandit confessed the location where his male and female accomplices were hiding. The team then went to No. 128, Lai'an Lane, Zhabei, and arrested Zeng Can, 41 years old, from Guangdong, who sells porridge, and Zeng's wife, Ye, 38 years old. At No. 94, Baochang Road, they arrested Wang Li, 46 years old, from Yangzhou. These women confessed that the male and female children kidnapped by accomplices such as Zhang Xiaosizi were sold in various places. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they recovered a four-year-old girl from the home of Pan Feng's family at No. 19, Shengsheng Lane, Qiujiang Road. There was also a red post, which was bought on the 24th of the lunar December last year, at a price of 28 yuan. The case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Setting Up a Fake Tobacco and Paper Shop, Manufacturing Drugs, Arrested; Where Did the Main Culprit Lin Hanqing Flee To? Temporarily Detained for Seven Days to Arrest Accomplices <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Li Wenbin, a Chinese detective from the Huijia Police Station, recently learned that someone was organizing and manufacturing heroin and morphine on the upper floor of the Tongshun Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 53, Chengdu Road. He began an investigation. Coincidentally, No. 51 opposite the tobacco shop was empty. Detective Li contacted the watchman at No. 2259 there. Every night, he would climb to the roof to observe. Sure enough, he saw shadows moving about on the upper floor of Tongshun, working very busily. The detective confirmed the facts, so he, together with anti-drug detectives Wang Rulin and Guo Ruiquan, applied to the First Special Court for a search warrant and went to arrest them at 11:15 AM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, they were well-informed and had already moved some important items. The upper floor was also empty. They arrested six suspects downstairs: Chen Zhenqiao from Yong, Wang Gen and Xiao Shui from Chaozhou, Zheng Zhiming and Yao Si from Shantou, and Chen Tong. They confiscated more than 20 scattered items for manufacturing drugs, including a magnetic funnel water tank, scales, and wrapping paper (the paper was still stained with poisonous substances - permission). It was also learned that the Tongshun Tobacco and Paper Shop was opened by Lin Hanqing. Lin's family lives at No. 24, Chengdu Fang, Chengdu Road. The detectives went to Lin's house, but Lin had already fled upon hearing the news. They only found 16 items in the room that were used for making drugs, including glass tubes, soda tablets, and a machine, seals, and account books, which were all taken back to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, recounted the circumstances of the arrest, stating that the main culprit in this case was at large, and that the tobacco and paper shop he opened was actually a fake. He deliberately posted a notice at the door to rent out the remaining rooms upstairs, believing that he could avoid the attention of the police. In reality, the upstairs was used exclusively for manufacturing drugs. Therefore, the police requested that the individuals arrested be detained for a week in order to arrest accomplices, and that the poisonous substances on the wrapping paper be scraped off and sent to the Engineering Bureau's Health Department for testing to determine whether they were morphine. Under questioning, Wang Gen confessed that the morphine manufacturing operation was led by Lin Hanqing, with Jiang Mingsong as his deputy. He used to work on a ship, but now that the ship has been sold, he is temporarily staying with Lin. It has only been ten days. Their work is very secret and they do not let me know. The others all tried to shirk responsibility and refused to tell the truth. Judge Wu Zehan verified the confessions and ordered that Chen Zhenqiao and the other six be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 PM the night before last (the 6th), Yin Qi, an outside affairs officer from the Su Song Third Police Section of the Shanghai North Station, was inspecting the post at the intersection of Wangjiazhaizhai Road and Huiwen Road behind the station when he suddenly saw a car speeding towards him, stopping at the street corner, turning off the lights, and honking the horn frequently. After a while, he saw shadowy figures carrying large packages resembling bedding onto the car from the lane. A burly man was directing back and forth, jumping into the car, and ordering it to drive quickly. The officer, being alert and quick-witted, suspected theft and immediately stopped them. Unexpectedly, the man stepped forward and claimed his surname was Liu, and that the packages in the car were all smuggled foreign silk, purchased in Tianjin, and brought to Shanghai by the Huping train. He pleaded for them to be released. The other men helping with the transportation scattered like startled birds. The officer believed that carrying large packages at night was similar to theft, and even if it was smuggled foreign silk, it was still a violation of regulations. He escorted the car and the people and goods to the section for handling. After an interrogation, yesterday morning (the 7th), he telegraphed the Jianghai Customs to send personnel to take custody of them and handle the case according to law. It is said that a total of thirty-five packages of smuggled foreign silk were seized, worth about seven hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Shui Jiantang, a creditor of the Gongfa Company, recently filed a criminal private prosecution with the Second Special Court against Huang Wang Juzhen, the wife of Huang Chu Jiu, and her sons Xianzhong and Xianyao, on suspicion of damaging creditors' rights. The hearing was held yesterday, and the defendant Wang Juzhen (50 years old, residing at No. 22, Fuxi Fang, Fuxi Road) and Huang Xianzhong (24 years old, employed at the Sino-French Pharmacy) arrived with their defense lawyers. The plaintiff and the defendant Huang Xianyao did not arrive. First, the lawyer representing Shui stated that the plaintiff was a depositor at Riyue Bank. He recently learned that the defendants had a dispute with Gu Yuqi of Tongde Hospital over 47,500 yuan in construction fees, which was litigated in your court. A settlement was reached in the second instance. However, the defendants had already filed for bankruptcy and had no right to dispose of the property. The plaintiff believes that it has damaged creditors' rights and requests that they be punished according to the law. The defendant's lawyer replied that before the settlement with Tongde Hospital, there was a creditors' meeting that stipulated the repayment of 47,500 yuan. He then recounted the previous litigation and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. Judge Sun stated that the plaintiff and the counterclaim defendant had not arrived, so he ordered the case to be adjourned to the morning of the 18th for further questioning.</p>

<p>The shantytown in the Yutong Road area of Zhabei in this city, after appealing to the Party and government authorities to order the landlord to postpone the forced eviction, was suddenly set on fire twice in the early morning hours before yesterday morning, burning down more than ten thatched huts. More than 400 residents of the shantytown had no choice but to petition the Public Security Bureau yesterday at noon, appealing for a thorough investigation of the truth. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Petitioning in a Group</p>
<p>The shantytown residents stated that after being set on fire twice, the lives of the poor were in great danger. In order to request the authorities to thoroughly investigate the truth, they temporarily organized the Zhabei Yutong Road Shantytown Petition Group at about 12:00 PM yesterday morning. Each held banners, and petition representatives Liu Dongshan, Peng Yuanfeng, and Miao Xiangben, etc., carried a petition and led more than 400 men, women, and children from Zhabei to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to petition. However, before the petition group arrived, the Wenmiao Police Station had already received the news in advance and reported it to the headquarters for instructions. Several officers were sent to persuade them to return home, and they promised to handle the matter in accordance with the points requested in the petition. The representatives were satisfied, so they gathered their team and returned.</p>
<p>Presenting to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday, the shantytown representatives Liu Dongshan, etc., jointly submitted a petition to the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of the truth. The text read: "Submitting a request for investigation and relief. The shantytown residents have already submitted a petition to order the authorities to postpone the forced eviction and to appeal to the Social Affairs Bureau, landlords, etc., to discuss relief matters. However, while waiting for a solution, at 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM today (March 7th), fires were set twice in succession. Fortunately, the fire trucks from the Chinese and French concessions were called to the scene by the Heji Biscuit Factory at No. 22 Yutong Road and Zhu Gongguan at No. 94 Changan Road, and the fires were extinguished. More than ten thatched huts were burned down. Not only were Zhou Shilin, Xia Ankang, Jiang Shugao, Wang Wenxue, Li Shirong, and Zhang Dianbang, etc., in trouble, with dozens of old and young having nowhere to live, but all the shantytown residents are in deep water and dire straits. Therefore, we urge Your Excellency to uphold the principle of loving the people and to thoroughly investigate the name of a construction owner who is heavily suspected in the incident, the name of the person who commissioned the construction, and the names of the police chiefs and police officers of the Second Sub-office of the Fourth District of your department who repeatedly ordered them to evict them from their homes, and to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations in order to find out the truth and relieve our suffering. We cannot bear the urgency of awaiting orders. Sincerely presented, (Industry and Commerce Association)"</p>

It is known that the film premiered in the YMCA auditorium yesterday afternoon, with two screenings, which were extremely popular. It is heard that today at 6:00 and 8:00 PM, there were originally two screenings. According to someone from the association, in order to save expenses and time, they will be combined into one screening at 8:00 PM tonight. Those who hold 6:00 PM tickets can use them at 8:00 PM today.

<h3 id="e135">The YWCA Held a Relocation Ceremony Yesterday; Many European and American Women Participated; Mayor Gave a Speech with Many Warnings <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Shenshe Times reported that the Shanghai YWCA recently moved to No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road because the original site on Yuanmingyuan Road was not sufficient for its use. The ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than 100 Chinese and Western people attended, and Mayor Wu gave a speech, making it a grand occasion. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attending Personnel</p>
<p>Those who attended on that day included the president of the association, He Lin, and her wife, the vice president, Yu Ying, and her wife, and Mei Huaquan's wife, Secretary Zheng Baiwei's wife, director Jin Zhang's wife, and Mayor Wu, etc., more than one hundred people. Many European and American women participated. The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association President Mei Hua's wife held a flag-raising ceremony and sang the Party song, which was solemn.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks</p>
<p>Then, President He Lin Yi's wife gave the opening remarks, saying that the association has been established for several years and has paid great attention to social undertakings. Recently, due to the rapid development of the association, the original site on Yuanmingyuan Road has been insufficient for use, so we have moved to the current site. She also reported on the association's business situation. The purpose of the Huaguang Troupe is to use group activities to cultivate good habits and learn true knowledge for girls. There are currently seven Huaguang countries with more than 200 members. The association's dormitory is clean and well-equipped, and is specially used to receive single women passing through Shanghai and professional women away from their hometowns. The employment agency hopes that women with skills will have the opportunity to serve society and support themselves. Last year, the association introduced two to three hundred Chinese and Western women who obtained employment. Popular education implements popular education, specializing in teaching poor, elderly, unemployed women, etc. In short, the association embraces the two proverbs of Jesus: I am here to serve the world, not to be served. Furthermore, our relocation this time aims to break superstition, because the new site is what Shanghai people call an unfavorable house. However, the proverb says, "Outstanding people make the land outstanding, and bad people make the land bad." Therefore, this relocation is not only to expand the association's affairs, but mainly to break the obstacles to the construction of China's new transport, which is to break superstition. In China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated equal rights for men and women fifty or sixty years ago. I believe it is difficult for women to achieve equal rights and liberation, but to make our nation's revival successful, we must make women's liberation successful and increase the ability of Chinese women. However, to achieve equal rights and liberation, we must first allow women to have a position in society, have the ability to cultivate themselves, and have true ability and knowledge, which is not limited to what is created in schools. There are also many things that can be obtained in society. Women with knowledge must be able to create social undertakings. Women with knowledge who do not work should bear this responsibility. They must understand that women's responsibilities are very important and that they bear the mission of reviving the nation. They must follow the norms of virtuous wives and good mothers in history to seek the revival of the nation and the strength of the country. I believe that women with knowledge and time should be asked to come out and do social undertakings such as popular education, so that women without ability and knowledge can also be transformed into women with ability and knowledge. This is an indispensable process in the women's liberation movement. Please everyone double your efforts. The virtuous wives and good mothers in history are the sovereignty of women. I believe that the explanation of virtuous wives and good mothers is only for the family, which is too narrow. You must know that the purpose of women's liberation is to achieve equal rights between men and women and to seek the revival of the nation. How can the revival of the nation be successful? It is necessary to cultivate many virtuous wives and good mothers. The object is not only the family. We must broadly interpret it, such as Mencius' mother teaching her son in the Warring States period and Yue Fei's mother teaching her son in the Song Dynasty, which are not limited to the family. We must promote it to the revival of the entire nation. The responsibility of women themselves is to be virtuous wives and good mothers. It is best for everyone to imitate the mothers of Yue Fei and Mencius to guide our little citizens. There were few virtuous wives and good mothers in the past. Now I hope that all women in the country will become virtuous wives and good mothers, then the country can be revived and the nation can survive. The most important thing about the women's liberation movement is that she herself must use her responsibility to the country, because men and women both have the responsibility to save the country. I believe that men's responsibility is now, and women's responsibility is in the future. What is the responsibility of the future? The life of China is in his hands. The responsibility of the future is very great, to make our nation exist forever. Saving the country is not only the responsibility of men, but also the responsibility of women. It is simply a matter of the key to the survival of China's future life. Therefore, I want to persuade women to break superstition, to be virtuous wives and good mothers, to demand equal rights for men and women, and to serve social undertakings. The YWCA is the leading group in the women's liberation movement and is the practitioner of women serving society. Please everyone double your efforts, so the relocation of the YWCA is really very meaningful.</p>

His new film "Modern Times" premiered in New York on February 5. Although tickets were priced at US$5.50, the theater was still sold out. Viewers praised it, believing that no one but Chaplin could have made it.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Circular Order to Shanghai Maritime Circles: Commercial Vessels Not Allowed to Enter Magong Port; Japan Prohibits Commercial Ships from Entering; Additional Ports Opened Between Kaohsiung and Pingtung <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, a ship of the Sanbei Company encountered a storm on the waters of Taiwan and entered Magong Port for shelter. It was detained by the Japanese naval authorities, and it was only after repeated negotiations that it was released. Last year, several typhoons occurred in the South China Sea, and many Chinese and foreign ships that sought refuge in Magong Port were also detained by the Japanese navy. The port has been designated as a Japanese military fortress area, and all foreign commercial ships are absolutely prohibited from entering. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in document Guo Zi No. 1751, notified the Ministry of Communications, relaying a report from the Consul in Taipei, that the Japanese naval authorities had notified that Magong Port had been designated as a fortress military port, prohibiting Chinese and foreign commercial ships from entering. However, due to the large waves in the waters off Taiwan, foreign ships often enter without permission. Therefore, due to the prohibition of commercial ships from going to Magong, the Japanese authorities have established a general port near Kaohsiung and Pingtung to provide shelter from storms and temporary anchoring in the waters off Taiwan. However, sailing ships are subject to Article 2 of the Tax Regulations of the Taiwan Customs, Imperial Edict No. 52 of the 24th year of Meiji, which stipulates that sailing ships not propelled by horsepower are not subject to the prohibition and may still enter and exit Magong Port as usual. The Ministry of Communications has issued instructions to all shipping merchants in Shanghai, ordering them to inform all ships to take note. From now on, except for sailing ships, our country should not enter Magong Port again.</p>

<p>At 11:20 PM last night, Wan native Fang Lianzu, accompanied by a Japanese pharmacist named Yakushiji, reported to the Laozha Public Concession Police Station that they had suddenly encountered four bandits near North Sichuan Road and Yunnan Road, who robbed them of 13 yuan in legal tender. They requested an investigation. Detective Yang Dechun and the Western detective questioned Fang and the Japanese separately. Finding many suspicious points, they searched Fang and found 13 packs of heroin and 2.23 yuan in legal tender in his inner pocket, as well as a notebook. The notebook revealed that Fang had sold as many as 1,164 packs of heroin since the 2nd of this month. After detailed questioning, Fang confessed that since the 1st of this month, he, the Japanese Yakushiji Yamada, and three Chinese nationals had organized a heroin selling ring on the upper floor of No. 50 Yunnan Road. Around 10 PM tonight, four people came pretending to be police officers, robbed Yakushiji of 20 yuan in banknotes and three packs of heroin on the table, hence the report. The detectives went to No. 50 Yunnan Road to search, but all the drugs had been hidden, so they found nothing. They detained Yamada and sent him and Yakushiji to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. Fang was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation, stating that the case still needed investigation and requesting a postponement. Fang Lianzu confessed to running a drug selling business with the Japanese, admitting it without reservation. The court asked whether the business was based on profit-sharing or wages. Fang replied that the Japanese paid him a daily wage of 0.6 yuan. Judge Qian Hongye noted that this kind of business was extremely harmful and should be severely punished. As further investigation was needed, he ordered Fang to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Portugal Loses 2-3; Chinese Team Retains the Wanguo Cup; Key Portuguese Players Corazza and Costan Absent; Chinese Team's Victory is a Natural Outcome <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wanguo (International) Football Championship has once again been won by the Chinese team. Yesterday's final against Portugal at Yiyuan attracted 8-9,000 spectators. Portugal was missing two key players, Corazza and Costan. Even though Remédi made a comeback, acting as a strong defender, he could not shake the Chinese team's momentum and undermine their chance at the championship. Seeing the Portuguese team's weak lineup, most people predicted that the Chinese team would win even before the match began. As a result, the Chinese team completed their championship with a score of 3-1. Recalling last year's final, also between China and Portugal, the Chinese team won 3-2, which is quite a coincidence. The Portuguese team had great confidence this season, fully expecting to win the championship, but their wish was not fulfilled. Unfortunately, as the competition approached, key players such as Corazza and Costan were unable to play due to injuries, resulting in failure.</p>
<p>Portuguese Coordination Acceptable</p>
<p>The Portuguese team started by using new players and fought hard at the beginning, showing great momentum, but gradually weakened due to a lack of experience and failed to maintain the glory of opening the scoring. The team's coordination was good, but their kicking power was weak. They mainly used small passes to attack the center, and there was little activity on the wings, which was not ideal. Therefore, it was difficult for them to break through the Chinese defense line. The goalkeeper was able to use correct judgment to deal with incoming balls and made many saves. Remédi was the soul of the defense line. He was calm and composed, responding to the Chinese forwards' fierce attacks and making a great contribution. The rest of the team also did their best and remained unremitting.</p>
<p>Chinese Team's Momentum Not Smooth</p>
<p>The Chinese team's victory was inevitable, but their performance was not particularly outstanding. The forwards were sometimes confused and unable to cooperate with each other. The front and back lines were separated, and the defense could not support the offense, resulting in an isolated forward line. Sun Jinshun's adjustments in the second half changed the situation. The team's lack of coordination prevented each player from fully displaying their skills. With the weak power of the enemy's forwards, it was not easy to penetrate deep into dangerous areas. The result of 3-2 did not really reflect the tension of the game.</p>
<p>Gonçalves Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>In the starting lineup, Portugal launched a spirited attack on the Chinese team's position with great momentum. Jiang Shanjing made several saves, protecting Ting Shan. Chen Zhenhe launched an attack from the border, Remédi waited patiently, calmly seizing the ball, and Yi Chen advanced in the center, picking the ball forward. Zhong Yongshen rushed forward to catch the ball but was intercepted by the Portuguese goalkeeper. The Chinese team made several attacks, but Remédi defused the danger with steady steps. The Portuguese army seized the opportunity to attack, advancing from the center and reaching the Chinese goal, creating a tense situation. The Chinese team made a slight negligence, and Portuguese left inside forward Gonçalves stole a shot and opened the scoring, only ten minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun Scores with a Header</p>
<p>With the win and loss decided, the audience's emotions were intense. Because the Chinese team's attack was unfavorable and they suffered a counterattack from the enemy, they tried to recover their lost ground. The troops on the left moved forward. Sun Jinshun was the first to kick, firing a shot, the enemy goalkeeper was shocked, unfortunately, the ball bounced back from the goal post, Yi Chen spurred his horse, continuing to besiege the city, although he succeeded, he was offside, at this time the Chinese team's momentum was very strong, but the enemy's camp was heavily guarded, unable to enter it, 25 minutes later, Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball in, to the edge of the penalty area, the enemy was penalized for stealing the ball, Gu Dangxiong kicked, the landing point was excellent, the goalkeeper rushed out to hit the ball, Lao Sun greeted it with his head, opening the scoring, creating a tie.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Also Scores</p>
<p>After that, the two sides stalemate again, you come and go, no chance, the situation gradually became dull again, the Chinese team's front and back were separated, unable to communicate, Portugal's short pass, also lost its effectiveness, the wings were weak, with no progress, 42 minutes, Yichen scored another goal, the Chinese team then turned defeat into victory, stimulating the Portuguese team to counterattack, pouncing on the Chinese fortress, getting a corner kick opportunity, just as it was about to be kicked, the first half ended, after a break, the Chinese team made significant progress in communication in the second half, while Portugal was determined to resist, the ball situation was often exciting,</p>
<p>Penalty Decides the Game</p>
<p>Portugal still adopted the strategy of preemptive strike, attacking the Chinese team, the forward and guard called into one breath, able to activity, how could the Chinese team show weakness, Lao Sun made consecutive supply, so that the contact was quite successful, both sides missed a lot of food opportunities, at 10 minutes, Jia Youliang in the corner position, passed the ball in front of the enemy team's goal, the kicking power was very accurate, Yi Chen shot hard, the ball touched Gonçalves's hand, the penalty was a penalty kick, Sun Jinshun kicked, sent the ball into the corner, the opponent could not save it, the Chinese team then took the advantage with three to one, the game was decided from then on,</p>
<p>Victor Secretly Releases a Cold Arrow</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe relied on his strong physique, sprinting very fast, and repeatedly stirred up trouble, making the enemy army uneasy, Yongshen Youliang, seemed to have a little more barrier, unable to receive the wonderful effect, but in general, the Chinese stood on the best battle line, making Portugal unable to resist, lacking the strength to attack, unfortunately, there were very few scoring opportunities, Zhenhe Yichen Jinshun repeatedly launched high balls, so that the record could not be increased again, stalemate for half an hour, the Portuguese team suddenly stood out, out of the blue, Victor secretly released a cold arrow, Zhang Rongcai's line of sight was blocked, the ball bounced off his body into the goal, inadvertently losing a goal, the result became three to two,</p>

<p>A particularly early, light dinner was decided upon, followed by another round of hair-wiping and hand-washing: then this group eagerly looked forward to the arrival of the guests. However, only close relatives were invited; because these small amusements were purely family-style. Later, everyone arrived; Mr. and Mrs. Ma, Siliu and Meg's mother, although she wore mourning clothes, and a small widow's hat surrounded her quiet face, but she was still so gentle and lovely. Aunt Tandi and Uncle Amy, along with their daughter, who is now even more like a fairy, wearing a sky-blue dress, carrying a large bouquet of fruit flowers, which she distributed to the children, inserting them into the buttonholes on their clothes, making them feel particularly exquisite and beautiful. Only one unfamiliar face appeared, Aunt Tandi led this unnamed person to Mr. and Mrs. Pei, and said:</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Hader: he is here to hear about Don playing cards; I boldly led him here, he can see how much this child has progressed."</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pei beckoned, he was very happy, because of [Don]'s sake, it was still remembered that this child, and he was naturally happy in his heart. However, after a few minutes of conversation, they had a feeling of regret for not having met Mr. Ha sooner, because they found him to be such a cheerful, sincere, and interesting person. When the son saw the light on his friend's face, it was already a pleasant thing: even more pleasant was seeing Mr. Sha's surprise when he saw the progress in Don's appearance and manners; but the most pleasant thing was seeing two people sitting in the corner of the room, deeply talking about topics that they both found interesting, comparing their views, and each telling about their outdoor life in the summer, forgetting the differences in their ages, cultivation, and status.</p>

<p>March 8th Women's Day Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e167">Our Advocacy <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Guangmei</p>
<p>At a time when the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious and the imperialist enemies are intensifying their aggression against China, the commemoration of the March 8th International Working Women's Liberation Day makes us feel that the responsibility of the women's circles in China is even greater, and the significance of the joint commemoration is even more profound!</p>
<p>We are very clear and understand that the current Chinese women's circles demand true liberation, and to obtain true freedom, independence, and equality, we must transform the current social and economic system, and first strive for the success of our national liberation movement!</p>
<p>The position of our country and the environment of our nation are different from all other capitalist countries and all colonies. Our country is a semi-colonial country, and our nation is under the encroachment and oppression of white and red imperialists. Therefore, the responsibility we bear is even greater than that of women in all other countries!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that our current urgent task! Should be to take active action against imperialism and feudal remnants as a means to strive for the complete victory of our national liberation movement, to rescue China from the dangerous semi-colonial status, and thereby transform the current social and economic system, and achieve the complete liberation, independence, and equality of our women's circles.</p>
<p>Because of the profound and significant meaning of March 8th Women's Day for Chinese women in this extraordinary period, we have decided to abandon all commemorative forms for this March 8th, and only deeply remember the importance of our responsibility, grasp our confidence, and earnestly implement our work route!</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Meaning of Commemorating March 8th <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Jinying</p>
<p>March 8th has a history of more than twenty years. We only recognized its significance after the Northern Expedition. Therefore, gatherings are held and celebrations are held everywhere every year on this day. But when we are commemorating this March 8th in this time of internal and external troubles and national crisis, we naturally have many feelings when we look back and forth!</p>
<p>Our celebration of it is to commemorate past achievements, grasp the current path, and work hard to create future undertakings. Therefore, when we gather to celebrate in high spirits, our hearts are full of enthusiasm, and we expect the public to seek women's happiness. Our commemoration is definitely not a meeting or speech. We should recognize our surroundings, observe the future of women's destiny, and give new strength and new stimulation to the women in deep water and fire, the women who are still not liberated, after this March 8th, to find a bright way out for them. This is the meaning of our commemoration of March 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Superfluous Words on March 8th <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Daiyi</p>
<p>Time flies, and "March 8th" is here again. The editor of the "Women's Special Issue" wants to add a word to commemorate the grand festival. The meaning of March 8th has been recorded in detail by previous people. I am not good at writing, so what can I add? But I have been unable to refuse, so I will offer a word reluctantly.</p>
<p>Since "March 8th" began in 1909 until today, the weather has changed twenty-seven times. It has also been introduced to China for nearly ten years. However, our women are still as ignorant as before, the women's movement is still as sluggish as before, and the liberation of women is still as empty as before. How can we not sigh at this grand festival! Recently, the national crisis has deepened and the disaster is imminent. The past cannot be undone, but the future can still be pursued. Our women must reverse the past and invigorate their spirits, be down-to-earth, be aware of the heavy burden, and fulfill their responsibility to help each other. Ms. Zhang Mojun encouraged us with "Return our rivers and mountains and revive our national customs." I am not smart, but I am willing to follow her lead.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Women in the National Salvation Movement <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Zhenyu</p>
<p>—Written for March 8th Women's Day—</p>
<p>1936. In this extraordinary period full of crises and imminent dangers, the women of China, no, the oppressed women of the whole world have reached the stage of survival or death. There are clearly only two paths in front of us: one is to fight for survival; the other is to submit to slavery. There is no need for me to explain in detail which way to go. Any sensible woman can make her own choice. Therefore, I think that the women of China, who are in the eve of this storm, should not be able to do anything by just making a declaration and shouting a few slogans on the day of any commemoration meeting. We should recognize our goals, nest our strength, fight for national survival, and shed blood for the freedom and equality of oppressed women all over the world. Only in this way is our proper way out, our current urgent work, and our undeniable task.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the current world situation is clearly forming two major camps: the oppressors and the oppressed. The oppressive imperialists, because of overproduction, the economy is gradually concentrated in the hands of capitalists, they have to find ways to develop outwards and expand their colonies as a source of absorbing the economy to consolidate their own foundations. Therefore, the imperialists do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to expand their military preparations and actively develop their colonies to reduce the crisis in their own countries. On the one hand, they want to use the glory of foreign wars to deceive the people, numb the people, and drive the people to the battlefield to die. This is a fact that cannot be denied by the current capitalist imperialists. And the oppressed small and weak nations, seeing the fall of their homeland, fearing the increasing depletion of the national economy, and the difficulty of making a living, naturally united into a united battle line to make a desperate counterattack against the oppressors.</p>
<p>Since the world is an unstable world, and China is a part of the world, it is certainly no exception. Moreover, China is currently under the oppression of a strong enemy and has reached a point of intolerable pain. If we are willing to survive. Then the inevitable path is "resistance." If you are willing to prepare to be a slave, then the inevitable path is "submission." However, I think that except for those who are completely bloodless, no one will want to see China, which has a history of thousands of years, vast land, and abundant resources, being taken by a strong enemy without saving it, and no one will bear to see our compatriots being slaughtered without helping. We are at this critical moment of national survival, and everyone should understand the ancient teaching of "if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to," and everyone should stand united under the banner of resisting the enemy and fight to the death with the invaders. Therefore, the national salvation movement is the urgent task of the people of the whole country and the work of the people of the whole country who desire to survive. However, there are many ways to save the country, and if there is no unified goal and route, it is easy to fall into divergent and ununified paths. We should stand under the government's command to resist the enemy and continue to struggle with the strong enemy. We must achieve the goal of national liberation before we stop.</p>
<p>That being said, the knowledge of Chinese women is not as widespread as that of men. Many of the work that men can do cannot be compared with men because of women's knowledge and physique. Therefore, I think that in the future, the Chinese women's circles should strengthen their physical fitness and eliminate their weak habits for the national salvation movement. We know that China's most humiliating nickname in the world is the title of "sick man of East Asia." Although this refers to the whole of China, the number of women who are physically unhealthy and weak is indeed higher than that of men. To save China, the first important thing is to exercise our bodies. If the body is not healthy, all methods and claims are in vain.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think that women should resolutely abandon luxury decorations. In recent years, we have been shouting about the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the collapse of the national economy. However, according to the customs' import reports every year, the consumption of women's decorations has been increasing almost every year. This huge outflow of profit sources can make the national economy increasingly depleted on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can be seen that women are becoming increasingly extravagant. This is something that our women's compatriots cannot ignore. Because of the arrival of extraordinary times, the women of the whole country really do not need this kind of consumables.</p>
<p>More importantly, in this period, the women of the whole country should have wartime preparations and universal rescue organizations. If there is no adequate preparation beforehand, not only will they not be able to support the government, but they will also flee in fear of war, which will further affect the work of resisting the enemy. Therefore, I think that before the war, women should have wartime preparations and universal rescue organizations. On the one hand, they can consolidate the morale of the people in the rear, and on the other hand, they can provide substantial help in the war. Moreover, it is quite appropriate for women to take on such work. Although there are many other responsibilities that women should bear, and of course the work of women in the arrival of extraordinary times is definitely not that simple, I cannot describe it in detail here due to the limited space.</p>
<p>In short, I think that for the women of China who are surrounded by strong neighbors, there is no doubt that only resistance is our true way out.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Random Talk on Women's Day <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hui Ruo</p>
<p>Women's Day is a memorial day for working women seeking "bread and peace." Middle and upper-class women in our country should feel ashamed of the word "labor," because they are idle all day long. I think that the most blessed and lazy women in the world are none other than women from middle and upper-class families in China! They rely on their fathers at home, their husbands after marriage, and their sons after their husbands die. They live carefree lives all day long. They don't know how high the sky is or how thick the earth is. They don't understand the situation of society, the trends of the world, or the troubles of their fathers and brothers earning money. They only know how to reach out to their fathers or husbands for money to study gorgeous clothes, compete for novelty and win. Besides this, they are jealous. This is how they spend their entire lives. Half of this is also because there is an overabundance of laborers in China, so upper and middle-class families all have servants in droves, or at least an old nanny to order around. Therefore, these housewives, besides trying to win their husbands' favor with smiles, consider giving birth to children their greatest achievement. However, they only know how to give birth, not how to raise them, because as soon as their children are born, they hand them over to wet nurses. Afterward, they don't consider or care at all about the children's diet, warmth, health, or how to provide them with a good education. They don't ask about or hear anything, leaving everything entirely to the servants. They only know how to call friends and go to the theater and play cards, and to find out if their husbands are having affairs. Walking into their homes, you only see chaos and smog. It doesn't look like a family!</p>
<p>Therefore, I can't help but feel sorry for ordinary Chinese men. They are beasts of burden for their wives and children all their lives. When they return home, what family happiness do they enjoy?</p>
<p>However, Chinese men don't need to be pitied. They voluntarily become beasts of burden. They use "lack of talent in a woman is a virtue" or "women should return to the family" as tools to bind and restrain women, not giving them the same education as men, making women ignorant and stupid, turning them into playthings for men. They think that knowledgeable women serving in society are taking away men's positions and robbing them of their jobs (they don't know the reason for the increase in the number of unemployed). So they want to drive women back to the family. Think about how cheap Chinese laborers are. They can work like beasts of burden all day long for four or five yuan a month. How clever are the average wives and grandmothers? Who would be willing to save four or five yuan a month and labor hard themselves? They completely hand over housework to servants and enjoy themselves. But when things are too quiet, people naturally want to move around. Since ordinary men are unwilling to let them serve in society, they are happy to take advantage of this and specialize in eating, drinking, dressing, and playing. In the end, isn't it still men who are making trouble for themselves?</p>
<p>However, I want to advise all my sisters: please don't give up on yourselves. See clearly that China is now at a critical juncture of crisis and survival. As the old saying goes, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Since men and women are equal, then women should also strive to be good people and shoulder half the responsibility. Women with knowledge and ability should use it to contribute to society. If their knowledge is lacking or if they have young children and cannot leave the family, then they should manage the household diligently and frugally, assist their husbands and teach their children. If they have spare energy, they should further study advanced knowledge to revitalize China's declining society.</p>
<p>You should know that the rise and fall of a family can be determined by looking at the diligence and frugality of the housewife. Then, to examine the rise and fall of a country, wouldn't it also be necessary to look at the level of knowledge and ability of the women in the country, and their diligence and frugality? As a Chinese woman, living in this period of national crisis, wake up! Don't live in a drunken dream!</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange became more and more sluggish. The decrease in transactions also set a new record. If it weren't for No. 72's purchase of several hundred thousand, the market would have become even more silent and the people would have become more scattered. For this market price that has no progress or retreat, they feel even less interested. The trend initially caused the short side to wait and see after No. 77 bought in. If it doesn't fall first, it's really hard to rise. Yesterday's experience had no honor or disgrace. Only the morning opening and closing saw No. 72 buying several hundred thousand, with a slight market. The market price rose slightly. The two afternoon markets were very calm and sluggish.

<p>(South Shanghai) Most of the shipments are still thin rice, which is also refreshing. Qingdao Yantai helped to handle more than 2,000 packages, so the popularity is strong and the price is firm. This aspect also followed suit, and the situation was smooth.

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the flour market, each month saw a flat phenomenon. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago, fell by 45 jiao in the near term and 2 jiao in the far term. The Canadian Umbrella fell by about 1 jiao, so at the time of the opening quotation, the market atmosphere had once again weakened. However, because the bottom code was not abundant, the market could not fall too much if there were few sellers. Therefore, in each subsequent market, the transaction was very clear, and there was little fluctuation, almost a mutual exclusion situation. Until the afternoon opening, this month was slightly stable due to customer needs, and the long term was also slightly higher. However, transactions were not smooth, and the long and short sides were waiting and seeing. There must be new wheat, and each month will have a development state once there is a grasp.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Futures Wheat is in the Process of Hovering <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month turned stable. Although foreign wheat fell, people's hearts seemed to pay little attention. Although there were openings this month, there were very few transactions. The morning opening was 2 jiao 3 fen, and the afternoon opening was 2 jiao and a half. From June onwards, there was a slight drop due to foreign wheat, but then outsiders pulled in, and it rebounded slightly, which was 23 fen better than the previous day. The spot wheat market is still hovering, with little change. Because the factory appetite is average and the arrival is not very abundant, there is an exclusion situation. Shandong wheat opened at 5 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen, and Hankou wheat opened at 5 yuan 4 fen, totaling 1,500 packages, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>According to Mao Lai's estimate, the production quality of American wheat is usually 70.2%. According to Crowell's estimate, it is 75%. The average estimated output is 522 million bushels, which is bearish. There is still no rain in the southwest. It is heard that the harvest outlook for Canada is one of the best years since 1932.</p>

<p>— He Bo</p>
<p>The bond market is closely related to the financial market. This is because the financial industry in our country mostly uses public bonds as a platform for capital activities and profit-making. When finance is tight, bonds are sold to recover cash, and the bond market falls. Conversely, when there is surplus capital, bonds are purchased, and the bond market rises. Therefore, the changes in the government bond market can be used to measure the fluctuations in the financial market. Although the bond market's rise and fall are not limited to this, it is obvious that it is manipulated by the financial sector. The domestic government bond market in our country has two locations: Shanghai and Peiping. However, the transactions on the Peiping Stock Exchange often follow Shanghai. Moreover, only the "96 Public Bond" is traded. Therefore, we will only briefly describe the situation of the domestic bond market in Shanghai. The Shanghai domestic bond market prices for the 24th year are listed below. (Note 2)</p>
<p>According to the bond index, from January to March, bond prices rose by 2.43%. By April, they reached the highest peak, averaging 100.03, which was 5.47 higher than the average at the beginning of the year. After May, the financial situation became increasingly tense, and the domestic situation did not improve. At that time, there was a road of inflation, and the market was tightening. People's morale was declining, and the bond market gradually fell. By November, the bond market rose again, stimulated by the Ministry of Finance's monetary policy. In order to understand the various changes, we will further analyze them below.</p>
<p>In January, due to the New Year holiday, there were only seven trading days in the market. The price fluctuations were narrow. The highest index was 97.66, the lowest was 92.66, and the average index was 95.56. In February, except for the 23rd year Customs Treasury bills rising to 81.9 yuan, there were no significant fluctuations. In March, a sudden rise occurred in the middle ten days. This was because under the atmosphere of international loans, both speculation and investment were enthusiastic. The total index rose from 95.06 to 97.99. April and May were generally unchanged. In June, due to extremely tight credit and the tense situation in North China, a sharp drop was triggered. Various bonds fell by one to six yuan. Subsequently, the fluctuations followed the North China issue. Next, the discussion about implementing inflation caused the bond market to plummet. The average index fell by 6.57 compared to the previous month. In August, the inflation rumors passed, and the bond market returned to a peaceful state. The process in September was still consolidating. In October, the situation changed drastically. The Sino-Japanese relations were dangerous due to the war between Italy and Abyssinia. New low prices unseen in recent years were created. In the last ten days, the dispute between Britain and Italy tended towards peace, and monetary reform gradually became apparent. Therefore, by November, the bond market was entirely affected by the Ministry of Finance's new monetary policy, and it rose daily. Minister of Finance Kong also clearly announced that "after the implementation of the new system for eighteen months, the national finance can achieve a balance of payments." (Note 3) Therefore, all bonds trended upwards. It was rare to see the discount rise by nearly 90%. The transaction volume for this month reached 369,999,500 yuan. The total futures transaction volume for the entire month reached over 810 million yuan, which was also unprecedented. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e191">What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jianming, Qingdao City Chenglu Elementary School</p>
<p>Being a person is the biggest question, and what kind of person to be is the most difficult question to solve. Such a major question is probably impossible for parents and teachers to solve for me. So, I will solve my own problem myself!</p>
<p>The treacherous currents, like raging waves, are running wildly. Generally, ignorant youths, confused all day long, not distinguishing east from west, or black from white, drift with the current, resulting in tens of thousands falling into the boundless sea of suffering. This is all because they have no opinions, no plans, no goals, only focusing on the present, and disregarding the future. So, when the sun sets and they reach the end of their road, they ultimately fail!</p>
<p>Judging from the current trend and the future trend, I am afraid that things are getting worse and it is difficult to reverse. However, no one can shirk their responsibility for social reform. The current society is extremely bad. There are no merchants who are not cunning, no gentry who are not bad, and generally, young people are not corrupt and deteriorated. My opinion is: I cannot save the already overturned tide, but I should be a pillar in the middle of the stream, and I must not go with the flow, drift with the world, and become a corrupt and deteriorated element.</p>
<p>I am willing to be determined to be thrifty, honest, brave, and hardworking. I will not sell foreign goods in business, I will not be afraid of bloodshed when I am a soldier, and I will not be afraid of hardship when I am working. This is my highest principle for being a person in the future. If I do this, even if I cannot improve society, I will never be infected with the bad habits of society and repeat the mistakes of ordinary young people.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Two Model Students <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The families of A and B, with whom I live, each have a child studying at the Central Elementary School here. They are both good students, so they were both selected as model students by the school. Their qualifications for being selected are because: 1. Good academic performance, 2. Good character, 3. Good health, 4. Diligent service, 5. Helpful, 6. Lively, 7. Thrifty, 8. Clean. Children who are eleven or twelve years old can have these eight advantages. The title of "model student" is undoubtedly well-deserved.</p>
<p>Parents should be very happy that their sons are model students at school. But no. The mother of child A told me: "My son likes to eat good things. He cannot stand coarse tea and light meals. If there is no meat in a meal, he will throw bowls and chopsticks and sulk and starve. Thriftiness does not only mean not pursuing beauty in clothing, but also being able to eat coarse food and be content with simple clothes and food. That is true thriftiness. He is also not diligent in service. He is unwilling to do anything at home. If you ask him to sweep the floor or wipe the table once, he is always reluctant and looks unhappy. Two of the eight qualifications are not true. How can he be a model student?"</p>
<p>The father of child B also said: "How can my son's character be considered good? He is afraid to speak and afraid to move at school. He is very restrained. He seems to be a well-behaved student, but he is actually a wooden person. Therefore, the word 'lively' cannot be mentioned. When he sees a stranger, his face turns red and he does not dare to look at him or speak to him. He is also so timid that he does not dare to go out alone. How can this kind of child be called a model student?"</p>
<p>I sympathize very much with what their parents said. I ask, if child A cannot endure hardship, how can he stand in society in the future, even if he has good knowledge? Child B only knows stillness and does not know movement. When he should move, he does not move. When he should speak, he does not speak. When he grows up, he will have no ability to speak or do things. What can he do? Many children are afraid of enduring hardship, and many consider silence and immobility to be good character. Therefore, I wrote this down and asked everyone to check themselves to see if they are like this.</p>

<p>The cerebellum is very young, and its personality is quite close to that of fish - the lateral line system - so it is not as clever and capable as the cerebrum. Although it was separated from the cerebrum to establish its own household, it cannot wisely create new undertakings, but can only make our human body balanced, stable, and regulate muscles.</p>
<p>However, its aspirations are very upward. Knowing that it has no creative ability, it always tries its best to learn and imitate the actions of its ancestor - the cerebrum. But, after all, because it is too young, although it imitates very well in many places, it never dares to overstep its authority and plunder the cerebrum's proper work. During the day, in front of the cerebrum, it only dares to participate in a little opinion at most. When we sleep at night and the cerebrum rests, it then comes out to represent the cerebrum in handling some trivial matters. This kind of work is most easily seen in summer:</p>
<p>For example: a mosquito is stinging us somewhere. As usual, the local sensory nerve sends a telegram to report to the central brain nerve, but the cerebrum is resting at this time, and the cerebellum receives this telegram. After receiving this telegram, it immediately orders the motor nerve on behalf of the cerebrum: "Quickly go and swat the mosquito away." Our hand unconsciously kills the mosquito, and our cerebrum does not even know it.</p>
<p>However, its age is too small after all, and its childishness is too deep. It often plays jokes with us intentionally or unintentionally. And children are most easily fooled by it. To give an example: when you fall asleep at night and have an urgent need to urinate, the cerebellum receives this report and cannot handle it, so it gives you a dream: you run vaguely to the place where you often urinate during the day, and you urinate happily; and when you wake up, you realize that the "happy urination" is still in bed. This is the reason for the formation of bedwetting in children.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is a money grubber, dreaming of clearly picking up a lot of foreign money, but waking up with empty hands!</p>
<p>These are all jokes that the cerebellum plays on us!</p>

<p>A Country with a Complex Population - Panama</p>
<p>Children know a lot about the Panama Canal, but they don't know much about the Republic of Panama. Now I will talk about its situation:</p>
<p>Chicks Under the Eagle's Wings</p>
<p>Speaking of the Republic of Panama, it can also be called a weak nation. It was not originally a country, but only a state of Colombia. Later, because the Americans wanted to obtain the Panama Canal rights, they helped it become independent. Then, they used 10 million US dollars to buy five miles on each side of the canal and several islands belonging to Panama. They set up military facilities and sent troops to guard them. The Republic of Panama is almost a protectorate of the United States.</p>
<p>Narrow and Long Like the Character "丁" (Ding)</p>
<p>The Republic of Panama is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. It is the narrowest country in Central America. If we look at its terrain, doesn't it look like the character "丁" (Ding)? (Viewed from the side) The coastline is winding and there are many harbors.</p>
<p>Very Complex Population</p>
<p>The country has a population of 440,000. The population is very complex. There are Spanish people, Native Americans, black people, Americans, and a few Europeans. There are also many Chinese people. The girl in the picture is a Native American. Her attire is strange and she wears silver rings on her nose.</p>
<p>Close to the Equator, the Weather is Hot</p>
<p>The Republic of Panama is close to the equator and the weather is very hot. The interior is mountainous. The country has many forests. The main products are bananas, chocolate, rubber, mahogany, pearls, and tortoiseshell.</p>
<p>A Startling Past History</p>
<p>The past history of the Republic of Panama is startling. In the 17th century, this place was a place where explorers and pirates ran rampant. Behind the modern city, surrounded by forests, there are still dilapidated old houses, which were destroyed by pirates more than 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Very Easy to Recognize National Flag</p>
<p>The national flag of the Republic of Panama is very easy to recognize. The entire surface is divided into four parts. One quarter is red; one quarter is green; the green square has a white background with a green star; the red square also has a white background with a red star.</p>
<p>The weather is good in spring, fly kites in the suburbs. The wind is strong, the kite is high. The baby's ambition soars to the sky.</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Effect of Flower Colors <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<p>Flower colors vary in many ways, but they are generally very pleasing to the eye. When the god of spring arrives, the flowers on the earth all compete for beauty and splendor. When we see such a scene, we all rejoice and admire it, thinking that the creator has made these beautiful flowers for human appreciation, and humanity can be said to be extremely happy, and the creator can also be considered to be very thoughtful. However, if we carefully study it, we will know that the colors of all flowers are not entirely for us humans. Their object of competing for beauty and splendor is only insects.</p>
<p>If there were no such thing as insects in the world, all flowers would no longer have any color. Although there is a bright sunny weather, this world will be silently colorless.</p>
<p>Plants need insects as a medium for their pollen to reproduce. Our old saying "bee matchmaker, butterfly messenger" is very suitable for this situation in nature. Plants, because insects help to spread pollen, are no different from merchants who want to sell their goods, so they also use advertisements like merchants. Every flower's bright petals are loudly telling the insects that there are delicious sweet nectar or abundant pollen for them to collect.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of insects, and their appetites are also different, so each different flower color represents a special kind of material. Flowers that need bees to spread their pollen are especially purple or blue-violet.</p>
<p>Yellow and red have little or even no attraction for bees. Recent experiments have shown that bees are colorblind to red: they see red as black, like we see photographic negatives. But ultraviolet light, which cannot be seen by the human eye but can only be sensed by photographic film, can be seen by bees.</p>
<p>Bees sometimes collect from flowers that we call red, but these flowers often have other colors mixed in, rather than being purely red.</p>
<p>Pure red flowers produced in the tropics are pollinated by birds.</p>
<p>Butterflies will collect from many brightly colored flowers. Night-flying moths specialize in collecting white and light-colored flowers.</p>

<p>— Junpeng</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Fuyue was playing with a convex lens in his hand. Dad, while reading the newspaper, said: "Fuyue, what are you playing with?" Fuyue said: "I'm playing with a piece of glass." Dad said again: "This is not called glass, do you know that?" Fuyue thought for a while and said: "This is a convex lens!" Children! Do you know the name of a convex lens? Just because Fuyue's father is a natural science teacher at a small school, the words "convex lens" were already printed on Fuyue's cerebellum.</p>
<p>Fuyue's father put down the newspaper and smiled: "Do you want to see me perform a magic trick?" Fuyue said with a smile: "What magic trick are you going to perform?" Dad walked to Fuyue's side and said: "I'll use the convex lens in your hand to perform a magic trick." Fuyue gave the convex lens to his father. Dad took the convex lens in his hand and walked into the sun, saying: "Fuyue, bring me a piece of paper." After a while, Dad put the convex lens in the sun. Behind the lens, there was an extremely bright point. He put the paper straw on this point. In an instant, he saw strands of smoke gradually rising, and then the paper straw caught fire and burned. Fuyue was surprised and said: "Wow! Wow! That's really strange. How did it burn?" Dad smiled and said: "This is because you know that sunlight travels in parallel. A convex lens has a function. All light rays pass through it and converge at a point behind the lens. In physics, this point is called the 'focal point' - it is also an inverted image of the sun - so the heat at this point is the highest, and the paper straw is naturally easy to burn. In the future, you can understand it in detail in physics, so I don't need to explain it anymore."</p>

<h3 id="e197">How to Learn Arithmetic? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Children, what is arithmetic? Simply put, arithmetic is the basic skill for studying science. Usually, the most painful and unhappy subject in school for you is arithmetic, isn't it?</p>
<p>In fact, arithmetic is not difficult. If you are willing to work hard, understand what you read, remember what you understand, and write what you remember, then you will definitely find arithmetic more interesting than other subjects.</p>
<p>To learn arithmetic, the first thing to do is to read the theorems and definitions thoroughly. Use a red pen to mark the places you don't understand and ask your teacher until you have a thorough understanding.</p>
<p>Secondly, do more exercises, because doing exercises is a great way to help you remember. And it is not easy to be proficient without doing a lot of exercises.</p>
<p>When there are complex and difficult-to-solve problems in the exercises that take a lot of time and you still haven't solved them, you can do the next one and put the previous one aside temporarily. When you finish the exercises, redo the previous one. Sometimes you will immediately realize and solve it. This way, you won't waste too much time and your interest will be very strong!</p>
<p>Children, when we learn arithmetic, first, we must understand what we read; second, we must remember what we understand; third, we must write what we remember; and fourth, we must solve what we write. If you can do these four linked steps, no matter how difficult the arithmetic problem is, you will always be able to solve it. You will know when you try it!</p>

<p>— Huren</p>
<p>During a drought one year, the grains and grass on the earth withered.</p>
<p>A flock of thin and hungry sparrows gathered together to discuss how to find food. A large sparrow said: "If things continue like this, it will be too bad. Many humans are starving to death. What will we do?"</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a small sparrow said: "I remember there is a granary on East Street. Why don't we go and see if there is any rice to eat?"</p>
<p>Everyone followed it. Sure enough, there was a large granary. The little sparrow was the first to fly in and saw a lot of grain inside. It came out to report to everyone.</p>
<p>Many sparrows flew in and ate their fill. One sparrow suddenly asked: "People have so much grain, why are so many people still starving to death?"</p>
<p>They never solved this problem.</p>

<p>The great waves of the Pacific Ocean are rolling up a torrent that engulfs mankind. The clouds and winds of Siberia are carrying the form of a hideous war god. The great war cannot be avoided after all, but it is only a matter of sooner or later. Although the current Sino-Japanese problem has temporarily reached a peaceful state, the sudden conflict between Italy and Abyssinia and the confrontation between France and Germany are already blatant everywhere. There are already sparks on the front lines, and there is a danger of explosion at any time. They are all raising funds to purchase combat weapons in preparation for a great war after the expiration of the League of Nations' non-aggression pact, and will make a fierce battlefield in the Pacific Ocean. Our country is in the right place, and there is a danger of national extinction and species extinction at any time. Children, be suddenly alert! Resolve this misfortune.</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>What did he want to see? Padereshi thought quietly, looking up at Xiao Nanluo with its big, sympathetic eyes.</p>
<p>One day, the gatekeeper happened to be away, and the two large iron gates happened to be half open. It followed Xiao Nanluo in and saw what Xiao Nanluo wanted to see. It turned out to be two extremely large murals on both sides of the choir.</p>
<p>Xiao Nanluo knelt before the two sacred murals, happy as anything. When he saw Padereshi, he quickly stood up and gently pulled it out the door. His face was wet and covered with tears. He looked up at the places covered with cloth in the temple and whispered to Padereshi: - "Padereshi, just because a person is poor and cannot pay, he cannot see those paintings. What a difficult thing that is! I know that the person who painted those paintings would never have refused poor people to see them when he painted them. He must be willing for us to go and see them at any time - to see them every day - I can be sure of that. But they cover these paintings up - cover them in darkness. Those beautiful things! - They have never seen the light of day, and no one's eyes have looked at them, unless rich people come and pay. If I could see them all, I would be satisfied even if I died."</p>
<p>But he could not see those paintings, and Padereshi could not help him, because the price for visiting those sacred paintings in the chapel was very high. To get such a sum of money was as difficult as climbing to the top of the chapel.</p>
<p>They never had any extra money. If they had money, they would have to buy some firewood, put it in the stove to burn, and cook some meat soup in the pot. This was their greatest strength. But the child's heart constantly longed to see those great sacred paintings that were covered up.</p>
<p>In the faint morning light, they hurried through this ancient city. The sun had not yet risen, and people had not yet gotten up. Xiao Nanluo and Padereshi dragged that small cart of milk, delivering it door to door. In the child's dream, he was still seeing the sacred paintings in the chapel. He was cold and hungry, barefoot in wooden shoes. The winter wind blew his thin hair and blew up his thin clothes, but he was still very happy to think that all he saw in his eyes was the majestic face of the Holy Mother Mary, her golden hair draped over her shoulders like waves, and the eternal sunlight shining brightly on her forehead. Xiao Nanluo, a poor child who was illiterate and had no knowledge, and whom people did not pay attention to, knew that he had a natural love for painting.</p>
<p>No one knew. Like such a small child, no one knew.</p>
<p>Only Padereshi, who was often with him, saw him often drawing on stones with chalk, heard him murmuring blessings to the great painters on his straw bed; and saw his little face light up in the slanting sunset or the rosy morning light. Padereshi also felt drops of hot tears falling from his little eyes and falling on his own yellow, furry forehead.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Dispute Over Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— As It Is</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai telephone charges, whether for commercial or residential use, were calculated on a monthly basis without any limit on the number of calls. However, not long ago, the Shanghai Telephone Company suddenly announced new regulations, stipulating that commercial telephone fees would be ten yuan per month for 150 calls, and residential telephone fees would be six yuan and fifty cents per month for 100 calls, with an additional charge of three cents for each call exceeding the limit. After the announcement of these new regulations, most businesses considered it a disguised telephone price increase, which they could not accept in the current economic downturn. Therefore, they formed the "Shanghai Special District Telephone Problem Committee" to negotiate, requesting an increase in the basic number of calls to ease the burden. However, after extensive negotiations by the committee, there were no results; the telephone company's attitude was very firm, and the new regulations were bound to be implemented. Later, the Chinese directors of the Chinese Ratepayers Association put forward four compromise proposals: "1. Revise the per-call tariff schedule recommended by telephone experts as follows: Commercial telephone fees of ten silver dollars per month for 200 calls, and residential telephone fees of six yuan and fifty cents per month for 150 calls; 2. The above revised tariff schedule shall be implemented from April 1, 1936, which is one year after the temporary 11% price increase was implemented (the temporary price increase measure has been in effect since April 1, 1935); 3. After adopting the above revised tariff schedule, if the company's net profit exceeds the permitted 10%, the bureau shall immediately request the company to revise the tariff to immediately reduce telephone fees. If the company's profit is less than 10% after the above revised tariff is implemented, the company shall not request a price increase again within five years from the date of implementation of the tariff; 4. The bureau should ask the company to earnestly economize on operating and maintenance expenses." The Telephone Problem Committee immediately expressed its acceptance of this compromise proposal. However, after discussions between the Chairman of the Municipal Council and the telephone company, the company only agreed to accept the first point of the third article and the fourth article, rejecting all other points. At the same time, for some unknown reason, after the company rejected the compromise proposal of the Chinese directors, the newspapers published a letter from the Chinese Ratepayers Association to the Telephone Problem Committee, stating that many users had "approved and accepted" the company's new regulations; subsequently, the Telephone Problem Committee also expressed its intention to disband in anger in its reply to the Ratepayers Association. Now, the company has officially notified all users that it has decided to implement the new regulations from March 1; under the urging of the citizens, the Telephone Problem Committee has again expressed its willingness to continue its efforts and has scheduled a third joint meeting of various groups on March 10 to decide everything. Therefore, the future of the long-disputed telephone issue will soon be seen.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why businesses and residents install telephones is undoubtedly for their own practical needs; those who have telephones will certainly use them when necessary, and will never make calls for fun when there is no need. Therefore, the telephone company's so-called new regulations restricting the number of calls for users are obviously not to prevent "waste"; its purpose is clearly for the sake of "profit." Furthermore, according to the actual situation, limiting residential telephone calls to 100 per month may be sufficient, but stipulating 150 calls per month for commercial telephones, averaging five calls per day, is not enough. If a store makes an average of ten telephone calls per day (which is very possible), then according to the company's regulations, it will have to use 150 extra calls per month, calculated at three cents per call, and the store will have to bear an additional telephone fee of four yuan and fifty cents per month. This may not seem like much to the owners of large department stores, but it is difficult for small and medium-sized businesses who are struggling to maintain their businesses to bear this new burden.</p>
<p>Naturally, establishing companies, owning property, and operating all industries and businesses are, to put it bluntly, for the purpose of making profits; the Shanghai Telephone Company undoubtedly wants to earn a little more profit each year, which is not surprising. However, in calculating its own profits, the company should also think about the merchants and citizens who regularly provide them with profits, and consider whether these people can bear new burdens in this economic downturn, and whether they can earn more profit for themselves. We often hear small and medium-sized merchants say that they spend the whole year making money for landlords, water and electricity companies, and telephone companies, and that they are constantly under pressure and never prosper! This is true. Therefore, when many stores announced closures and "big sales" and "great auctions" were advertised on every street, when everyone was really helpless, merchants and ordinary citizens launched a rent reduction campaign to try to alleviate some of the burden; although this campaign has not yet achieved great general success, it has had some partial effects; in fact, rents have been reduced in some places, and some landlords have even voluntarily reduced rents, which is certainly a manifestation of being aware of current affairs. However, under these circumstances, the Shanghai Telephone Company has instead implemented a disguised but actually the most severe telephone price increase, which is really a manifestation of not considering the general merchants and citizens who make money for them at all!</p>
<p>Now, the telephone company's new regulations have begun to be implemented, and general telephone users and even general citizens will certainly continue to oppose them. We hope that the protesters will fight to the end, and we also hope that general citizens will pay attention to all public utilities in this city that are most closely related to our lives, such as water, electricity, and trams. Because these are essential to our daily lives, the people who run these utilities can control us and arbitrarily increase prices at any time. Take this telephone price increase as an example. Why is the telephone company's attitude so firm? On the one hand, it is naturally because, as the Telephone Committee said, they are "relying on the extension of foreign power and holding strong power"; but on the other hand, it is also because telephones are necessary for some families. If these families are unwilling to pay the higher price, the company can remove their telephones, causing them great inconvenience; therefore, they can control these users and forcibly implement the price increase. As for water, electricity, and trams, they are even more necessary for the general public, so their companies can better control the general public, and of course, they are also what we should pay special attention to. The purpose of this attention is to use everyone's strength to monitor the arbitrary price increases of these essential things, in order to excessively exploit us. Everyone should understand that the so-called things that everyone needs</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>are also the things that rely on everyone for their existence. If the price of these things is too high and exceeds the general standard of living, then everyone should deal with it together and not allow its price to be too high. The price of all essential things is naturally determined by the owners of these things on the one hand, but it is also determined by the consumers on the other hand; if the owners' regulations are completely rejected by the consumers, then these regulations will absolutely not be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e203">It's Easier to Climb a Mountain Than to Descend <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yangzhu</p>
<p>I taught at a middle school at the foot of Mount Lu for two years. During those two years, especially during the summer vacations, I received many letters from friends who envied my job location, saying that I must have accumulated good karma in several lifetimes, as I could climb Guling for summer vacation at any time. Little did they know that the reality was far from the truth. Guling did not reject us poor teachers, but economics could limit us. In the summer, the price index in Guling was several times higher than at the foot of the mountain. It was naturally a place for the leisure class to enjoy themselves. In addition, due to the recent revolution and the large number of troops, military expenses were enormous, so it was necessary to transfer educational funds to meet the emergency. As a result, educational funds were sometimes in arrears for as long as half a year. During the school term, we could elect representatives to petition the Education Department for salaries, but once the schools were on vacation, the Education Department knew that no one would come to petition, so they simply ignored it. Therefore, we were particularly poor during the summer vacation, and sometimes even buying rice was a problem, let alone traveling to Guling?</p>
<p>However, we four colleagues did make a determined, arduous journey to Guling. Each of us brought a small amount of money and set off at dawn on a sweltering summer day, walking to Lianhua Cave at about 10 a.m. After resting in a teahouse for a while, eating a few steamed buns, and drinking a bowl of bitter tea, we started walking up the mountain. The mountain road was fifteen li long, but it had neat stone steps, and we all felt that the mountain road was easy to walk on, and that it was easy to climb Guling. After turning several mountain bends, the scenery became more serene and secluded, and the gurgling sound of the springs filled us with a sense of leisure and distance! Halfway up the mountain, there was no trace of heat, the wind moved the bamboo baskets, and the clouds rose beneath our feet, and we couldn't help but shout with joy!</p>
<p>When we were three li away from Guling, it unexpectedly started to rain, and then the wind attacked, the mountains roared, and everything in front of us was dark. My colleague Mr. Cai cried out "Ah!", and the straw hat on his head was blown away. We all felt a little panicked. We had no choice but to walk tremblingly along the mountain cliff. The moss on the stone slabs was particularly slippery. If we lost our footing, it would be a bottomless abyss, and we really didn't know where we would be buried!</p>
<p>None of us had brought rain gear, and our clothes were soaked. Fortunately, we ran into a farmer. We gave him money and asked him to buy us umbrellas. He told us to wait for him in a pavilion. It was truly "seek what is lost from the wilderness." After a short time, he bought us umbrellas, and we mustered our courage and walked up to Guling.</p>
<p>Guling is truly a good place! There are stone paths that are full of poetic charm, with colorful wildflowers blooming everywhere along the paths, and the sound of gurgling streams can be heard everywhere. The buildings are built according to the mountain's terrain, with very few brick walls, mostly built with large stones from the mountain, and the forms and colors of the buildings are rarely the same.</p>
<p>Guling, everything is poetry, everything is painting.</p>
<p>We ran around the streets and nearby mountains for a while, and it was already 3 p.m. The fire of hunger was making us dizzy, and the high prices in Guling were something we had long admired. We found several restaurants, but we didn't dare to go in. Finally, we found a dilapidated noodle shop, assuming that it must not be expensive, so we went in to satisfy our hunger and came out.</p>
<p>After wandering around Guling for a while, a thick fog suddenly rose in the mountains, a vast expanse of white, and even the buildings could not be seen. We wanted to stay in a hotel, but we didn't have any money, so we braced ourselves and went down the mountain. We agreed to take one step at a time, calling out to each other, groping in the fog. The moss on the stone steps, moistened by the rain and fog, was even more slippery. Everyone thought: If we slipped and fell to our deaths, it would be a great injustice! It was truly "walking on thin ice," and after great hardships, we returned to Lianhua Cave, and the tense emotions relaxed a little, but everyone was covered in moss and mud, unrecognizable, and we couldn't help but laugh at each other's embarrassed state.</p>
<p>By the time we got home, it was already 7:30 p.m., and we couldn't move at all when we lay in bed. This trip's experience tells us that "it's easier to climb a mountain than to descend" is an irrefutable theory: because when descending the mountain, one cannot control oneself, and there is the suffering of calling to heaven without answer and calling to earth without response, just as "it's easier to get on stage than to get off," which is the same principle.</p>
<p>Interview with a Celebrity</p>
<h3 id="e204">Mr. You Huaigao, Owner of the Free Farm <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Qingyuan</p>
<p>It was an afternoon when the east wind was even more bone-chilling than the north wind. I braved the severe cold and got out of the car at the green bamboo fence gate. After a series of formalities, I was led by a Mr. Pan to meet Mr. You Huaigao, who has dedicated himself to agriculture.</p>
<p>This is a refined guest room, about ten feet square. Although the furnishings inside are not luxurious, they are arranged in an orderly manner. From this, it can be seen that Mr. You is indeed a very serious person in his planning for life. After we exchanged greetings, we began to talk about his business itself.</p>
<p>It is said that although the market has often been in a gloomy state of rain and wind in recent years, the Free Farm has been able to maintain its business without much impact due to proper management. The average daily sales of milk are more than 1,400 pounds in summer and more than 1,800 pounds in winter.</p>
<p>Mr. You is fifty-one years old this year, tall and slender. He was wearing a plain satin silk cotton long robe, with a Western-style shirt underneath and Western-style trousers. With a narrow face, a broad forehead, and a pair of fine tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, he looked every inch the scholar. After he told me about the current situation of the Free Farm, a look of self-satisfaction shone on his face.</p>
<p>"I heard that Mr. You used to study at Soochow University, but later went to the United States. Why did you change to studying agriculture?"</p>
<p>"This is due to family circumstances. Because my family has a lot of land, most of which is rented to tenant farmers. The miserable lives of those farmers left too bad an impression on me, so I later studied agriculture in the United States, preparing to make some contributions to my country's agriculture after returning home."</p>
<p>"You studied in the United States for many years, right?"</p>
<p>"Well! I went abroad in the first year of Xuantong and returned in the fifth year of the Republic. In those seven years of studying, I was immersed in the study of agriculture every day. Every summer, I had to go to the countryside for internships."</p>
<p>"Such a student's life, according to you, doesn't seem very comfortable!"</p>
<p>"Haha, a student's life is not as comfortable as most people imagine, especially for a student who is diligent in his studies, it is even more bitter. Moreover, because I wanted to graduate early and shorten the period of study, in addition to going to the countryside for internships every summer, I also had to go to the summer school established by Cornell University for supplementary studies; because one summer's course can earn at least six credits, and accumulating four summers can shorten one year."</p>
<p>"Mr. You's motivation for running the Free Farm probably started during his internship in the countryside, right?"</p>
<p>"I didn't think about it at that time. However, I studied rural economics and animal husbandry, so I was particularly interested in the animal husbandry business." He held the teacup tightly with both hands, looking reminiscent.</p>
<p>一This "Free Farm," did you start it after returning home?"</p>
<p>"No!" He paused for a moment, thinking, and said, "Soon after returning home, I and several close friends jointly established the "China Egg Trade Company," using scientific methods to transport eggs for export, but as a result, because the cost was too high, it was difficult to sell, and after more than a year of operation, we lost more than 10,000 yuan and stopped. Later, I wanted to set up a chicken farm, and spent half a year on investigation and design, but as a result, it was also stopped due to various difficulties: First, because egg prices were low and chicken feed was expensive, farmers raised chickens without much expense, and the cost was lower, so it was difficult for chicken farms to compete with them; Second, raising chickens in one place is very easy to cause infectious diseases, while farmers raise chickens scattered in various places, and diseases are rare, so there is no major sacrifice. Although these two businesses both failed one after another, my plan of "three acres of land and freedom" still lingered in my mind. So, in the seventh year of the Republic, I started to attempt to raise dairy cows. I started preparing in the seventh year of the Republic, and I took on all the investigation and design work myself. It took a full year and a half to officially establish it in the ninth year of the Republic. The "freedom" in "Free Farm" comes from my "three acres of land and freedom."</p>
<p>"The start-up capital of the Free Farm is probably very strong, right?"</p>
<p>"No," he said, slightly pausing as if he was afraid of disappointing me, "You don't have to haggle over the amount of money to do a business, but perseverance is very necessary. The Free Farm had only 15,000 yuan in start-up capital, and only three dairy cows, but now, the capital has increased to more than 200,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"In the early days of the business, you probably spent a lot of time planning, right?"</p>
<p>"Well! This really took a lot of careful consideration and selection procedures. The standards for choosing the site for this Free Farm, I first determined five conditions: 1. Convenient transportation, 2. Low rent, 3. Complete facilities, 4. Room for expansion, 5. Lease term of at least twenty years. I asked people everywhere to find a way, and it took a full eight months to find the current site according to my predetermined goals. The annual rent is 200 yuan, and the lease term is tentatively set at fourteen years, later increased to twenty-four years, and the rent has also increased from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan." The waiter brought a cup of hot milk, and he took a sip and continued with great satisfaction: "After the site was leased, I drew a plan and planned the cowshed, machine room, and writing room, and then applied to the Public Works Department for a permit to start construction." He took another sip of milk, and talked more vigorously as if he was telling a story: "The houses are built of brick, but because of economic constraints, I had to plan everywhere, both economical and beautiful. So, I decided to use white for the walls, green for the doors, and red for the roof; but at that time, foreign red tiles were very expensive, and it was quite difficult to do so financially, so I thought of a way to use the old Chinese tiles and add a kind of red color to make them foreign red tiles. I remember that the famous architect Dr. Lu Yanzhi praised my kind of tiles once."</p>
<p>"How was the business situation when you first started..."</p>
<p>"At that time, there was simply no business to speak of." He interjected before I could finish speaking: "As I just said, there were only three dairy cows when the business started, originally four, costing a total of 3,200 yuan, but one died in transit from Holland; only a little more than 100 pounds of milk were produced every day, and there were only dozens of regular customers. After a year like this, the 15,000 yuan of capital was completely lost, and later I converted my own house into cash and added it to the capital, and continued to operate, and it didn't start to improve until five years of continuous losses. The number of dairy cows increased from three to fifteen, thirty, and now there are a total of ninety; the number of regular customers has also increased from dozens to more than 5,000."</p>
<p>"There must have been a lot of surplus in recent years, right?"</p>
<p>"Since five years after the start of the business, there has been a surplus every year; however, because the organization of the Free Farm is not a company, the annual surplus, except for 4,800 yuan as the annual interest on my 60,000 yuan of capital, is used as a public reserve to prepare for expanding production and purchasing dairy cow machines, etc."</p>
<p>"Since the Free Farm is not a company organization, why bother with such a form?"</p>
<p>"This procedure is not "painting a snake and adding feet." Because although this is not a company organization, there are still some external shares, and the production combination is also collective; if I confuse myself with the farm,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>then it will not give a good impression to the general working colleagues." As he spoke, he took a notebook from the desk and flipped through it page by page for me to see. "Look, this is the amount of salary that the farm has given me over the years. From 1920 to 1922, I can be said to have been doing business for nothing for these two years, and I didn't take a penny of salary. It wasn't until 1923 that I stipulated 50 yuan per month, and it was increased to 100 yuan in 1925, and then it was increased by 50 yuan every two years, and now it's only 300 yuan. 300 yuan is not too much, right?" He asked me with a smile.</p>
<p>"Considering your contribution to the Free Farm, 300 yuan is naturally not too much! The treatment of the staff here is also not bad, right?"</p>
<p>"I can't say how good it is, but many of the staff and workers here have been working since the beginning, so you can probably guess how good their treatment is from this point." He said very modestly.</p>
<p>"I heard that Mr. You also runs a farm in Suzhou. How is the performance there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is run jointly by me and my younger brother, and it has been several years now. The capital is only 10,000 yuan, the farm covers an area of 50 mu, there are more than 30 dairy cows, and the average daily milk production is 500 pounds; he is responsible for managing it there, and the performance is not bad. We also opened a farm in Hangzhou, which is a branch of the Free Farm. The capital is 30,000 yuan, but there are only 15 dairy cows, and the daily milk production is more than 300 pounds."</p>
<p>"In addition to the Dutch breed, are there any other breeds of dairy cows available? Why can't Chinese cows produce milk?"</p>
<p>"The Dutch breed is the best for dairy cows. Although there are dairy cows in California, they are not as productive as Dutch cows. Chinese cows have absolutely no way to produce milk."</p>
<p>"If you cross Dutch cows and Chinese cows to produce calves, can they produce milk?"</p>
<p>"This is a work that requires a lot of effort but yields very little. According to research, at most, the first generation of calves produced by crossing Dutch cows and Chinese cows can produce a small amount of milk, but the rest, such as the second and third generations, have no effect, and by the fourth generation, they will still restore the original characteristics of Chinese cows."</p>
<p>"What is the daily milk production of a Dutch cow?"</p>
<p>"This cannot be generalized, because there are many reasons for this. For example, a Dutch cow can produce 60 pounds of milk per day in its home country, but when it comes to China, it will be reduced to 30 pounds; and when the calves it raises produce milk in the future, it will be as little as a little more than 10 pounds. On average, each of the 90 cows I have here can produce 15 pounds of milk per day." He said a lot, and then used a few machine-made fire　to make statistics and explain to me.</p>
<p>"This is probably due to the soil and water, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, this is also one of the reasons, but the feeding materials also have something to do with it. Because the food used to feed cows is mostly White-Clover and Alfolfer in foreign countries, these grasses are very nutritious, so the milk production of cows raised in foreign countries is much higher than that of cows raised in China. When I was learning to milk cows in the United States, I saw that they were all feeding cows with white flowers, and almost every farmer with cows had one or two hundred acres of land dedicated to growing that kind of white flowers. This kind of grass contains a lot of nectar when it blooms, and the flowering period is long. In general, farmers not only rely on it to feed cows, but also rely on it to raise honey, but in China, there is not such a large area to supply the grass and feed for cows to eat!"</p>
<p>"Are there farms like this in the United States?"</p>
<p>"The milk business in the United States is very developed, but its organization is very different, and there are even fewer farms like the "Free Farm." Most of the milk sources in the United States come from farmers. Each family produces from 30 pounds to several hundred pounds of milk a day, depending on the number of cows the farmer raises; the milk produced every day has to be sent to a milk collection agency before dawn. After that, the sterilization, bottling, and distribution are all the work of this agency, and the farmer can completely ignore it. It is said that in recent years, this milk business has become even more advanced. The milk collection agency has its own milk collection vehicles, which collect milk along the villages every morning. Farmers only need to write the weight on the milk bucket, and the milk collector will record it for him. This situation can only be done in the United States, but in China, it is not possible to reach that state for a while; this is partly because the organization of Chinese milk companies is different, and partly because the animal husbandry business in rural areas is not yet developed. Therefore, we must improve the milk business in China and pay attention to promoting the animal husbandry business in rural areas at the same time!"</p>

<h3 id="e205">Respecting the Elderly <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Man</p>
<p>An old horse knows the way, and an old doctor rarely makes mistakes. These sayings praise "old age." No wonder Guangzhou is holding an elders' gathering and Taiyuan is about to hold a respect-for-the-elderly convention. It shows that "old age" indeed has its respectable value.</p>
<p>"What do you young people know? I've lived for over sixty years and still don't understand, yet you claim to!" It seems that old people must know everything, and young people may not know. Because old people are always "old," they can therefore "rely on their age to act important."</p>
<p>Since "old age" is praiseworthy and respectable, then "youth" naturally has to learn to be more "mature." Even without a beard, they must stroke their chins, cough a few times for no reason, and pace back and forth as if something important is going on.</p>
<p>"I, your old man... you, little brat..." Such empty words sound impressive. Even if you are illiterate and nonsensical, hanging up a sheep's head and selling dog meat, with this "old" sign, who are you afraid of?</p>
<p>However, "old age" that is not handled properly naturally becomes "old and contrary," "old and decrepit," "old and senile," and so on. That is truly the worst kind of "old age." Therefore, "old age" should be made "stronger," which is a remedy for "old age."</p>
<p>Reading a commentary from the "Current Affairs News" on January 10th of last year, "On Respecting the Elderly," it says:</p>
<p>"We believe that the object of respecting the elderly is not respecting their "high age," but respecting their "abundant virtue." Respect those among them who can strive for the benefit of the people, and learn and accept their experiences and lessons in promoting social progress. As for those old, cunning, and slippery scoundrels and white-bearded old thieves like ×××, they have not only become antiques of the times but also obstacles to national rejuvenation...</p>
<p>"...Those remnants of the past who fill society, their spirits and bodies are prematurely aging. In form, they are young and graceful, but their daily lives are no different from those of muddle-headed old people."</p>
<p>Thus, I know that respecting the elderly should be about respecting those who deserve respect. Originally, I thought that old and young were just comparative terms based on age. Everyone is human, and there seems to be no need to look down on or respect them in the crowd.</p>
<p>Seeing those old people who have merely increased their age, not feeling "how easily time passes" and "wasting a lifetime," but instead gloating in their "old age" and taking pride in it, and seeing young people who are strong and energetic not igniting the "fire of youth" but only learning to be "mature," speaking "old words," and burying themselves in ancient books, "thinking all day about how to live a leisurely and carefree life," I can't help but gasp.</p>
<p>Book and Newspaper Review</p>
<h3 id="e206">Review of Zhou Zuoren's "Bitter Tea Essays" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fu</p>
<p>—Published by Beixin Bookstore, priced at nine corners per volume—</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren is a famous essayist in China. His "vernacular Chinese" mixed with many classical Chinese words and phrases has been praised for its "conciseness" and "simplicity." Some master, "wanting to cling to the tip of the bull's horn and defend it for life," even used his articles as a sign for the "quotation style" to resist the new vernacular Chinese. These are all well known. "Bitter Tea Essays" is a collection of his recent essays, including a "preface" and an "epilogue," containing a total of fifty articles of varying lengths. If distinguished by form, these fifty articles can be roughly divided into three categories: first, transcriptions and reflections on reading old books; second, prefaces written for other people's works; and third, general essays and notes. These articles may have been seen by everyone and have already received "positive reviews" in other publications, so there seems to be no need to say more. However, after reading this collection, I feel the need to say a few words, so I picked up my pen to talk about "Bitter Tea Essays."</p>
<p>Although "Bitter Tea Essays" is not a systematic work, but a collection of miscellaneous essays, we can first see the author's view of life in it. In the article "The Lesson of the Frog," the old man Zhitang—Mr. Zhou Zuoren—clearly tells us:</p>
<p>"In fact, it is very unwise to ask the old to follow the young. Among savage tribes, there are two ways to deal with the elderly: one is to kill them and eat them; the other is to have them stay behind in the stockade with the women, when the brave men go out to war. Asking them to run with the young will only result in them panting and their old legs failing, delaying the young's progress. If they are carried along as puppets, they can only scare the village children. In short, neither is the way to "respect the elderly." The elderly have their own time and place. Let them sit in the sun at the door, twisting ropes and making straw sandals, watching over the chicks and ducklings. Those who are elegant can also look at New Year pictures and write Wei-style calligraphy. Don't force children and grandchildren to be filial and hinder their work. That would be good... Those who sell their souls to the devil are said to become people without shadows, and those who dedicate their souls to God are not much different anyway. Those who do not believe in the soul can stand firm, because they have nothing to sell and can stand outside, although scolding is inevitable."</p>
<p>The old man Zhitang is of course old, and the above passage is his defense for the general elderly and also for himself. Based on this defense, he has determined the elderly's view of life that they should not follow the young: he does not want to "sell his soul to the devil" or "dedicate his soul to God," because these are "not much different anyway." Thus, he can only "sit in the sun at the door, twisting ropes and making straw sandals," and drink bitter tea, copy old books, and write doggerel poems; other than that, what national nation, life society...</p>
<p>However, Mr. Zhou's view of life for the elderly does not seem to be solely determined by his old age. This is related to the real country</p>
