<h3 id="c17">巴勒斯坦的回猶民族衝突 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>平靜多年之巴勒斯坦的回猶民族糾紛。現在又因細故而於十九日爆發了。形勢的嚴重並小亞於一九二九年的「泣牆」事件。據外國通信社的電訊。阿拉伯人與猶太人因衝突而死傷者。已有數十人之多。德賴維佛城與乍法城間的交通業已斷絕。海發港的阿拉伯人已實行總罷工。猶太人所開之商店多被迫停止營業。而回猶兩民族的示威運動。又復繼起不已此後事態的如何發展。實不易預測。不過就回猶民族糾紛的過去歷史說。這次　變是一時不會有圓滿的結束的。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦本是猶太人的故土。不過因他們向來散處世界各地。所以住在巴勒斯坦的人民。大部爲阿拉伯人。約的有七十萬人之多。而猶太人却反佔少數。僅有二十萬人之譜。近來散處各地的猶太人。因爲屢受各國政府的種種虐待。深感沒有祖國的痛苦。於是就興重建故國之念。所謂輯安會（Zionist）的組織。就是以復興猶太祖國爲目的的。大戰時英國因想獲得各地猶太人的帮助。答應贊助猶太人的復國運動。一九一七年十一月。貝爾福爵士就代表英國政府發表有名的宣言。謂「英政府極願見猶太人在巴勒斯坦建設一個民族的家鄉願以種種助力。促其達此目」。戰後巴勒斯坦劃爲英國的委任統治地。因此猶太人回到故鄉去的運動。更形急進。各地猶太人都組織團體。募集故國建設基金。在巴勒斯坦購買土地。移殖大批猶人回去。這樣一來。猶太人在巴勒斯坦的勢力就形大增。而引起當地阿拉伯人的嚴重反對了。原來阿拉伯人視巴勒斯坦爲他們的居住地。猶太人的大批侵入。從事復國運動。實不啻侵略阿拉伯人固有的權利。這次衝突中。阿拉伯人所提出的兩個條。（限制猶太人移入與購置士地）就是針對這點而發的。而猶太人則以爲巴勒斯坦本爲他們的故土。現在因不堪各國政府的壓迫而重返故土。建立民族的家鄉。實極有理由。何况這種復國運動已得到英國與國際聯盟的贊助。兩方面所持的理。雖很充足。但他們的實際利益終無法調和。而所奉的宗敎又各不同。因此嚴重的民族糾紛就不時爆發了。在一九二九年的「泣牆」事伴中。回猶兩族之死傷者。達數百人之多。近幾年來雖未發生重大糾紛。可是到了最近。却又因細故而爆發嚴重的衝突了。</p>
<p>英國對於回猶民族的衝突。表面上是採中立政策而並爲調解人的。可是實際上他却利用兩族的衝突去鞏固其在巴勒斯坦的統治地位。我們知道巴勒斯坦是地中海東部的要地。連接蘇彜士運河。在交通上與軍事上都佔重要的地位。英國是永遠不願放棄的。而要鞏固其在巴勒斯坦的統治權。只有儘量利用回猶兩族的衝突。使其互相內閧。而不注意於英國的統治。實是最聰明的辦法。大戰中英國的贊助猶太人的建國運動。以及一九三〇年的改變對巴勒斯坦的政策。都是根據這個原則而發的。在這種形勢之下。我們很希望回猶兩個民族。能够翻然自覺。停止內部的衝突。轉移鬥爭的目標。祇有這樣。被壓迫的回猶民族才能獲得完全的解放。而不致長受帝國主義的　絆了。</p>

<h3 id="c53">林業不景氣之面面觀　中央大學農學院李寅恭 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>論者於吾國民生凋敝，產物儉嗇，鮮不歸咎農林敎育之未得其道。予不敢多置辨，目就林業不景氣，下一平議，撮其大因，以吿國人。吾國山林荒廢達於極點，一方面殘餘之森林，其　量因尙無詳確調査，（刻中央大學森林系做斯項工作，不甘分次發表其報吿，（國際間物產比較，率少被採糧入統計；一方面　山及不生產之邱陵，面積之廣，　與之京；人口密度不等，燃料所需，尙未普遍以煤代木，工商業之和用林產，亦正在幼稚時期。　感國難，試一涉想國防上儲備，有待於林業上直接間接之供給者何限，而現狀若此，應如何以爲補直之計，是一絕大問題。其實並非無辦法，曰與林政，二日育人地才，開誠布公，化除阻碍，勿徒坐視而一籌莫展以蹈誤國之大戾，則庶乎有望。　將吾林業不景氣之原因，沭其大略如次：</p>
<p>林業人才不能集體應用　吾人講求林學本後他國，廿餘年　，攻習　科　人數有限，取證中華林學會員錄不足百五十人，可以恍然。重以政府未能用如所學，久之改業，占其少半，業林失敗，以至一蹶不振者亦有之。迄今鍥而不舍者，僅居其半，其間意見不諧，派別峙　，甚至不欲合作，互相傾軋者，在所難免。結果則影響於國家事業之無進步，何庸諱言。</p>
<p>一般人對林業重要欠認識周禮設官分掌山野，此種古制固　久遵，降及後代，如東坡植桑，營謀生計，戴　山種樹說，謂「竊負當世之志，欲盡庇天下之人，使無失其養」。殆無不視營林爲長治久安之策。末世風氣，流入於浮，求速觀念，蔽其逮見，視林利略遲緩，遂甘心放棄。政界中人更似抱五日京兆之心，置十年樹木大計於弗顧。以近年一事言之，僕旅行黃山後，鑒於彼處嘉木繁昌，係天然植物硏究之地，以爲應彷　山設一森林植物園，取作華南一帶物產試騐之中心，除提議於黃山建設委員會第一次大會外，復向當局一再申說，迄不獲採納，能不令人短氣。類此之事，不可枚舉。再就農學界言之，有身秉農業敎育，或試騐機關之大　者，或抹煞斯科，或蔑視之爲無足重輕，此亦同屬不智。更觀素稱先導之省分，如江浙者，通年農林行政制度，幾乎每歲更易一次，非信任人之無常性，即由於縮减經費，爲改組之原因。結果則地方事業，頻遭摧毀。更有地方林　行政向不以人才爲目的者，但調和派別，均分權利，充其調整力之所能至，不過敷衍門面，了却一段公案而已。試問切關裕國富民之命脈，救亡圖存之事業，可久久準是而行之耶！</p>
<p>林政似有若無罕聞國營之進行方策吾國開始林政，殆與民初同其悠久，不過森林法公佈期猶近耳。全國森林與荒山面積，今實業部一編有估計，姑置不諭。就國有林言，僅辦中央林區，範圍太屬狹小；且未着手設置保安林，何怪災祲不斷；未統一省有林之辦法，何怪省省各自爲政；未協商內政部淸査土地，宜林地之不知利用；未協商財政部，而國有林之擴大，荒山之收買，保護，之一切設施等費，都無所出。凡此諸端，皆我國今後所宜注意者。即政府對於林業行政，不欲中央集權，亦必授擄地方，而由中樞不斷從旁監督，稽核其事功，審定其計盡等。總之一切事未遽　莊大道，則領導之責在政府，迨業務緊張後，則賴專家合力以輔助之。以今日吾國之山野狀况，經營林業，非一方面之人力財力所能竟其全功。居恒竊謂凡山地面積有限，而接近村落者可委諸小農人家，盡力爲混農林混牧林之組合，面積遼闊而遠離村落者，則鼓勵地方公團經營，甚至課荒山稅以激刺之。國縈之入手，不妨限於保安林，較輕而易舉，然必須任用得人，其交往始著，而經費出納，尤必公開，庶可少糜費之弊。</p>
<p>山林保護太缺有效辦法按東西林業先進國，歲用鉅欵於保護行政以爲常。而保護之辦法，無不從嚴偉峻法實施起，以警憑頑，久則人民養成習慣，對於森林，秋亳無犯。吾國不能如此，以致多數森林，盡遭摧殘，故今後欲圖林業之發展，亦非藉政治力量之保護不爲功。抑今日大多數荒山之土層，猶在深厚可用之狀况，尤其是南部及中部丘陵，野生樹種頗夥。茲將本校幕府林塲野生樹百分率之調査表錄後：</p>
<p>表中各樹可代表南京各地自生雜樹之種類，若　歲伏冬不仟毀傷，抑或限止鄉民只許刈草，勿損椎樹。三五年後，必然蔚起原生林之人遊覽盧山，深覺該山之森林，即可以此法保護，而無須　人工之手續。各省類此者，何可勝數。又市鎮上負薪求舊者，應實成警察檢查。如係侵犯應保護之森林，　售受同科罰錢，久則此弊可以息止矣。</p>
<p>夫吾國林業旣因種種原因而陷於不景氣之狀態，其補救辦法，至少制度是與林政育人才，前已言之矣，若併此而不注意，則雖望林業之復興也。僕黨思英之印度林業，以Scblich氏功業嚴著，美之森林，係Fernow氏創立基礎，日本林業猛進，由松野氏介導，而豐功偉績，亦猶在今人腦海中。吾林業界豈竟無人肯努力建設打破此不景氣之現象耶！僕於此所言，非敢效日本林學者中並氏之營護政府，怨詬當世，舉盼贖者諒之。（完）</p>

<p>第十、「助人為快樂之本」、我們做人、當然都要求快樂、但是求快樂、不得其道便要求得痛苦、造成罪惡、例如現在一般人、以為間散頑耍、嫖賭逍遙是快樂、不知道這些事不但不是快樂而且正是浪費精神摧殘自己的生命增加自己的罪惡和痛苦、不知道人心眞正的最大快樂、莫如助人、古人說「既已為人己愈有、既已與人己愈多」又說「為善最樂」、就是說我們愈能助人、愈有好處、愈加快樂、現在童子軍有一個信條「日行一善」、也就是要助人、例如後溺救火扶老保幼救助貧寒飢苦傷痛病苦等類、事無大小、都是行善、行善便可以獲得眞正的快樂、凡是中華民國的同胞、大家都要如此求樂、互相親愛、彼此互助、只要有一分力量、一定要盡一分力量來後助我們的同胞、這是大的快樂、　　第十一、「學問為濟世之本」、這句話的意思、一方面是說我們要濟世救民、必須有學問有能力、即總理說「革命的基礎在高深的學問」的意思、另一方面是說我們研求一切學問技能的目的、是要濟世、是要救人、不是無目的無意義的、不是求個人溫飽和安樂的、更不是假學問技術來損人利已、濟奸作惡的、這個濟世必有學問、學問乃為濟世的道理、大家應該早已明白、允其是教育界各位先生、一定要向一般靑年學生澈底闡明、　　第十二、「有恒為成功之本」、我們大家當然個個入都希望自己能夠成功立業、成功立業、最要緊的條件是什麼、就是要有恒、無諭作何事、一定要繼續不斷的努力、不好中途而廢、或見異思遷、一定要有始有終、貫澈到底、允其是我們要成功終身的事業、一定要擇一條光明正大的道路、努力前進、至死不變、做到總理遺訓最後兩句、「一心一德貫澈始終」、譬如修公路、不修則已、既修便要從起點到終點、全錢修通、無論中途有多大的障礙、一定要打破到最後全錢貫通為止、不好如同過去四川修公路的情形、東修一段、西築一段、甲錢未通、又修乙錢、結果雖修了許多段、都沒有一條路貫通、如此修法、雖修了一千段、一萬里、都沒有用、所以我們無論築路、無論做任何大小事業、總要有恒、總要澈底、總要貫通、就是要自強不息、貫澈始終、才能得到眞正的成功、　　以上所講、這十二條守則、就是我們做人做事成功立業的基本要道、也就是我們革命建國的寶筏、今天兄弟特別貢獻於四川各位同志各位同胞、希望大家以後、要父母以此教其子弟、長官以此教其僚屬、政府以此教其民眾、使四川全省的同胞都能照此十二條身體力行、如此、兄弟相信今後四川和整個國家的進步、必能一日千里、突飛猛進、乃至不可限量、最後關於義務徵工這件事還有幾句話要附帶報吿、現在一般人對於努動服務的辦法、已經知道對於國民的身心、社會的秩序各方面、益處很多、大概沒有疑問、但是對於義務徵工的辦法、特別是在四川、都有很多人誤會和怨言、本來一個國家或一個地方、在撥亂反正之後、與艱難締造之中、要普遍推動民眾、來興辦任何一件新的事業、雖然是於國計民生裨益很大關係、最切的事業、起初的時侯、人民總時感覺不便、難免不有怨言、不必說義務徵工這種勞苦的事情、就是關於公共衛生整潔、這些普通輕微的事情、政府要干涉的時候、起初入民也要感覺不便、不覺懷怨、允其一件新制度推行的時侯、因為計劃不周、人事不齊、經騐不足等等原因、自然也不免發生流弊、格外難怪人民感覺痛苦、發生怨言、這全靠政府當局以及一般負有教導責任的人、能夠一方面斟酌情形、一方面啟導得法、卽如義務徵工這一件事、本來應在農作之暇、使民以時、特別在春季農忙的時侯、應當顧全人民的生計、體恤他們的苦痛、所以兄弟决定下命令、除川湘公路因情形特殊、不得已仍須繼續徵工修築以外、其餘各路義務徵工、一概停止一個月、不過四川同胞應當知道、義務微工不限於修路、將來濬河造林修堤等項、關於國計民生有益的事業、都要徵工的、我們被徵工作、决不會冤枉辛苦、我們為國家社會來勞動服務、就是為自己為子孫造福、例如公路修通之後、不但盜匪可肅淸、人民可以永遠安居樂業、而且在經濟文化教育各方面、都能得到進步發展、有莫大的利益、這些道理、希望我們一般智識份子、大家要負責向民眾多方開導、使他們明瞭、樂於勞動服務、助入濟世、兄弟此决由湖北乘輸船入川、有點特殊的觀感、就是看到三峽那樣重重險峻的高山、大禹在幾千年以前、居然能夠以人力鑒通、當時眞不知道你們四川的祖先被微了幾多工夫流盡了多少汗血、我想這種艱鉅水利工程、在從前機器未發明的時代、而要成功這樣偉大的工業、一般被徵的民工、不單餓死凍死的、無可數量、就是被水淹死的、為此濬川導江而犧牲的人數、亦不知有幾千幾萬的生命、就此可見你們四川人、不單是有絕大勞動建設的能力、而且有損己利人、為公忘私、至高無上的犧牲精神、能夠為千秋萬世的子孫、造此無疆的福利、大家試想、若不是四川人的視先能夠發揮勞動服務的能力與犧牲一切的精神、鑿通三峽、濬川入江、恐怕到現在、四川還是一個猛獸的世界、我們既在那裹、還能夠如此安居樂業、你們四川的祖先、既能鑿通三峽那樣重重的高山、為我們後世子孫造福、難道現在的四川人、要修幾條公路、就沒有這種能力嗎、這種修路的小事、有何希奇、值得怨聲載道嗎、我們不能恢復祖先固有的精神、發奮自強、便不配做中華民族的子孫、現代的國民、亦就是愧為四川入了、兄弟很希望四川同胞、以後必要發揚祖先勞動服務的偉大精神、為國家為同胞為千秋萬世的子孫造無疆的幸福、要憑你們四川人偉大的精神和魄力來完成革命建國的基本事業、造成四川人永久光榮的歷史」、（完）</p>

<p>廣州通訊、粵省自民國二十一年六月頒佈三年施政計劃後、並决定二十二年一月一日、開始實施、至今三年之期已滿粵當局因叉繼續厘訂第二期的三年計劃、並定本年上半年為考核與調查的時期、一方面檢閱過去的工作、究竟進展到什麼程度、一方面調查目前社會實際環境的需要、來决定第二期的三年計劃、現在除有關係的各機關將過去實施的情形、做具體報告外、而民政·財政·教育·建設·各廳廳長、在最近期間、均分別出巡各縣、從事實地的考察、博訪周咨、來做擬訂第二期三年計劃的參考、至於第一期三年施政計劃的成績、已有其相當的價值、因為該項計劃、是一種地方政府施政的程序、規定若干施政程序、俾各方面能分工合作。按步實施、從政治經濟教育建設各方面、建設出一個新的廣東、而且這些計劃、是根據國民黨的政綱和政策而决定的、在當局負責的人員、咸具有苦幹和銳進的精神、所以已有不少的成績、茲從各方面觀察、概述如下、</p>
<p>政治方面　就政治上看去，很容易看至治安上已得到很大的成績、因為廣東向來是土匪嘯聚之區、尤廣州灣·等外人統治地區、軍械私運利便、間接造成土匪的活躍機會、往往樹立堂號、擄人勒贖、四出搶掠、勒收行水等、為禍已有三數十年之久、而且海豐·陸豐·瓊崖·速陽·與惠來昆運南山等地、又為赤匪盤踞之區、赤匪土匪、互相為禍、成了粵省重大災害、迨實施三年　政計劃以後、一方面劃分五個綏靖區、各設專員負責綏靖、一方面積極編練地方警衛隊、充實地方自衛力量、由是不僅肅淸境內的共匪、而各股土匪也跟着撲滅、現在人民相安、商施無阻、這是廣東人所認為最滿意而樂於稱道的、其决、從　廣東官史的貪污、比任何一省來得利害、信是晚淸迄今、由來有日的、但這兩三年來、就有點異樣、一來最高當局、對吏治的整理、頗具决心、二來各縣財政局長、由省府財廳直接委派、他不是縣長的私人、不易舞弊、三來民政廳隨時派出人員視察、萬一發覺有舞弊的證據時、那就不客氣地嚴懲、所以這兩三年來、縣長因貪污而被撤職拘禁、甚而至槍斃的、也有多起、因此吏治的風氣、為之一變、</p>
<p>財政方面　廣東原稱為富庶之區、是廣東財政、應甚豐裕、究其實、廣東的經濟、以華僑匯欵及生絲出口為兩大支柱、年來受世界不景氣的影響、生絲褻落了、華僑匯欵也減縮了、造樣自然影響到時各種稅收的減縮、廣東的財政、也就發生不少困難、可是廣東當局、不但不想辦法去開不正當之源、增加稅收、反而裁減苛稅雜捐至一百二十餘種、年餉共毫洋六百餘萬元、至於一切行政經費、八成支付、復設法廓淸財政的積弊、剔除中飽、以增加公家的收入、經過二一四次的整理之後、每月也增加餉額三萬餘兀、這樣廣東財政、還可支持下去、至於廢止田賦改收地稅目的在減少以前有田無稅、有稅無田、及房科中飽等等積弊、這也頗具苦心的、現在差不多已完全改征地稅了、但是、這裹也有不少毛病、因為不是依人民陳報他價征稅、而是組織評價委員會、評定地價征稅、而土地則有肥瘠及交通利便與吾之別、稍一不愼、很容易發生糾紛、聞政府方面、正在設法調整中、其次、改征地稅後、是把一切田賦附加稅裁撤的、但有些地方。依然保留不少附加稅、這反使人民增加負担、最近政府巳明令禁止私收地稅附加費了、</p>
<p>教育方面　這兩三年來、教育當局、頗注重義務教育及職業教育的推進很適合中國實際環境的要求、他進步的程度怎樣、可以拿統計的數字來說明、在民國二十年、全省小學有一萬八千九百六十九校、舉生一百零九萬八千九百二六十五人、至民國二十三年、就有小學二萬二千七百五十四校、學生一百四十六萬九千四百零一六人、教育經費、由省庫支出的、（由地方籌欵的不在此數內）、民國十九年為二·一·三四·四二五元、至民國二十三年、則增至四·三三二·二七（）元、幾增至兩倍有奇、民國二十四年度、又增加擴充中等學校班級經費計十萬零六千餘元、新設立職業及師範學校共三十五萬餘元、津貼各一縣辦理短期小學、及增加義務教育、共二十五萬、（內由中央津貼十二萬元）、這樣叉增加七十錄萬元了、這幾年來、廣東財政收入巳經減少、而教育經費、則年有增加、從此可以見到教育行政很是煞費苦心的了、</p>
<p>建設方面　廣東政府已决定以政府的財力經營較重大之工業、在三年施政計劃中、會計劃籌設棉紗廠。絲織廠。毛織廠。蔴紗水結廠。硫酸為·梳打廠·燐肥廠·談肥廠·製紙廠·蔗糖廠·酒精廠。精鹽製造廠·玉蜀黍製酒精廠·殺虫藥劑製造廠·西沙羣島鳥糞混合肥田料製造廠·植物油膠酸工廠·油類製造廠·汕尾水產製造廠·機搾花生油廠·改良農具製造廠·漁船製造廠·新式漁具製造廠·鋼鐵廠·滃江水力電廠·總共二十四個工廠、而現在巳經成立的、有酒精廠·硫酸廠·梳打廠·木炭汽車廠·絲織毛絨·棉紗·蔴紗水結等紡織廠·淡肥廠·燐肥廠。蔗糖廠、在籌備而未成立的、有製紙廠·鋼鐵廠。滃江水力電廠、已成立的均有出品、商標是五年牌、在滬設有經理處推銷、允以蔗糖一項、成續最佳、因為廣東的土地與氣候、特別適宜於種蔗、亦從前土製蔗糖的時候、也有千多萬元土糖的出口、後來自機製洋糖侵入以後、土糖就日漸衰落、一般蓆農、無法維持、因此廣東政府在三年計劃中、毅然設廠購機榨蔗、製成的蔗糖、與洋糖無異、此後不僅洋糖減少入口、並月所製蔗糠、能運銷國內各地、省政府幷以蔗糖大有可為、仍積極擴充、現已規劃全省設立十大糖廠計劃、現時已有出品的有番禹新造市頭兩廠。揭陽一廠·惠陽一廠·順德一廠、正在籌備中的、有東莞一廠·南路海康一廠·瓊崖一廠、則將來十大糖廠的計劃、是不難實現的、不過蔗的原料、將來恐怕不敷供給，現時僅完成五廠、原料供給、尚發生困難、如果十大糖廠相繼成立、那種原料的供給、又怎麼樣呢、這不是一件容易解决的事、雖然政府在三年計劃中、有發展農村的計劃並决改一部分桑田為蔗田及開墾荒地種蔗、及由政府以低利息貸欵農民種蓆、復由政府與滬地上海銀行接洽、撥一百四十萬元、在粵分行辦理貨欵、這未　不可以解決、但事實上種蔗不適宜於新　的荒地、熟地又沒有這麼多、把稻田改種嗎　牠又關係着民食問題、如果想急切成功的話、那末、對新墾荒地土壤改造、政府是要想辦法的、因為這不是一般農民所能做到的、</p>

<p>吳淞之春季漁汛卽北洋黃花魚、昨日已有頭汛漁船三艘到　　　將各項情形探錄於左、</p>
<p>進口情形　本屆之春　　魚船　為數頗多、惟因洋面風浪甚大、故張網稍戚不易、昨晨巳有公和順金源泰金同增一漁船、先後進口、經海關騐艙後、卽起卸上岸、由萃盛愼泰關泰三魚行聯合辦事處經銷、規定價目每籌八十斤、售洋六元六角、每元可購魚的十四斤、但昨日所到之貨、祇能應酬當地各魚皈、故　地批發、須俟大幫漁船進口</p>

<p>魚行談話　昨據魚行方面之負責人告記者云、淞地之魚市、年來日形衰落、較之昔年旺盛時期，營業减去二分之二、故近年三行之聯合營業、包括春魚鱉魚魚乾而言、合共祗有二十餘萬元之生意、考其原因、因大多數漁船、均駛往靑島銷售、該地一則鹽價便宜、一則運輸减費、故漁船均掉頭北駛、致淞地魚行、受其莫大影響、</p>

<p>實業社云、本市銀錢業四底結賬期前、對於各項放欵、驟形緊縮、以致存底充厚、洋拆行情低小、减息問題定卜月初旬再議、茲探誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>放欵緊縮　銀行公會所展各會員銀行及錢業公會各會員錢莊、鑒於往年滬市工商各業、因市面不景氣、農村破產、入民購買力薄弱關係、一切營、每况愈下、遂恊力放欵救濟、藉期復興、及至今年四底、對各業所放之六對長期欵項、　實上頗難全數收回、且其間宣告淸理倒閉者、殊屬不少、為保護自身基礎起見、業於四底期前、一致實行緊縮政策、以維營業、</p>
<p>洋拆低小　錢業各莊年來因各業不振關係、自身營業亦形衰退、銀行中除中中交三行業務日見發達外、其餘各商業銀行、亦均大不如昔、因此對於各項放欵、大都異常審愼、以致金融集中、無法獲得出路、當此一年一度之四底非常時期、而錢業市塲洋拆仍低小為八分、於此可知銀錢業自身準備充足、已可穩渡難關、但工商各業方面、則借貸無門、前途頗為暗澹、</p>
<p>再議減息　財政部前准滬市各業領袖之請、特令銀錢業兩業擬具减低存放欵利息辦法、經該兩業協議呈復後、財部批覆着卽復議、昨據該兩業方面消息、財部對於上决呈復、本可贊同、惟因救濟市面關係、不得已再令復議、聞該兩業將於下月初旬、再度協减息辦法、力促實現云、</p>

彼此各不發生財產上之任何請求權，即與合夥契的當事人之乙丙，亦無權利義務關係之可言，蓋以其非契的當事人也，此種附股辦法，在商界巳具有悠久之歷史，近今一般商人，因我國及各國民商法規有隱名合夥之規定，遂誤解上述附股辦法即為隱名合夥，推原其故，無非以附股者與隱名合夥人，於合夥之債權人及債務人，均無直接權利義務關係，有此共同之點，而致發生誤解，茲就隱名合夥之特質，舉其最重要者分述如下，則附投之不能謂為即係隱名合夥，可以恍然悟矣，　按民事法理，契的僅其當事人相互間受拘束，換言之，受契的拘束者，必為同一契的之當事人，苟為另一契約之當事人，卽不得稱為本契的當事人之一方或他方，此原則也，隱名合夥為契的之一種，故一方之隱名合夥人，即係合夥契的之常事人，而他方之出名營業人，無論其為多數或少數，决無有不與隱名合夥人直接發生權利義務關係者，我國民法第七百條規定，一稱隱名合夥者，謂當事人的定，一方對於他方所經營之事業出資，而分受其營業所生之利益，及分擔其所生損失之契的，」例如甲乙丙丁四人組織隱名合夥，甲乙丙三人共為出名營業人，丁為隱名合夥人，或甲為出名營業人，乙丙丁三人共為隱名合夥人，是甲乙丙丁皆為契約當事人，相互間無一不直接發生權利義務之關係，核　上開民法法條之規定，即在同一契約之中，一方當事人為隱名合夥人，而他方當事人則為出名營業人，各受契的之拘束，反之，所謂附股，如前例，甲乙丙三人訂一合夥契的，丁父與甲訂一附股契的，其契約分而為二，丁非合夥契的之當事人，不受合夥契的之拘柬，乙丙非附股契的之常事人，不受附股契的之拘束，契的各別，當事人又復不同，其非隱名合夥，至為明顯，如果認甲丁之附股契約的為隱名合夥，甲為出名營業人，丁為隱名合夥人，試問與甲訂立合夥契的之乙丙，將居於若何地位，其將視之為隱名合夥契的以外之第三人耶，則乙丙旣為經營合夥事業之當事人，自不應屛諸隱名合夥契的之外，以背乎隱名合夥之原理，其亦稱之為出名營業人耶，則出名營業人，係隱名合夥人之對稱，乙丙與丁旣無直接權義關係，何能稱之為出名營業人，此中分別旣明，隱名合夥與附股，自可同時並行，兩不相妨，即附股於出名營業人也可，附股於隱名合夥人也亦無不可，例如甲乙組織隱名合夥，甲為出名營業人，丙得與之附股焉，乙為隱名合夥人，丁叉得與之附股焉，皆無傷於隱名合夥之成立也，他若附股可以有連鎖式多數間接之契的，則甲附乙之股，丙附甲之股，丁復就丙所附之股份而附股，又如附股者為二人以上時，可以各別與持有合夥股份之各僩人，締結彼此不相聯屬之契的，即甲乙二人組織合夥營業，丙對甲附股，丁對乙附股，隱名合夥則决不能有上述兩種之情形，縱或隱名合夥人不止一人，亦祗能共同或各別與出名營業人之全體直接締結契的，又在附股之塲合，其合夥事業，必為二人以上所糾織，吾則即無所謂附股，而在隱名合夥，則其出名營業人，不妨僅為一人，以上所論，皆係就契的締結之關係而為之判別者，　，依我國民法第七百零六絛第一項所載，「隱名合夥人，縱有反對之的定，仍得於每屆事務年度終，查閱合夥之賬簿，並檢查其事務及財產之狀况，一同條第一項載，「如有重大事由，法院因隱名合夥人之聲請，得許其隨時為前項之查閱及檢查，」此因隱名合夥人即為合夥契的當事人之一，凡屬出名營業人，無一不與之直接發生權義關係，法律所以賦與隱名合夥人以查閱及檢查之權利者，無非據此原理，吾則豈能令契的以外之第三人，容忍隱名合夥人之檢閱，至若附股，則附股者之一方，縱與其對手方特別約定，有查閱合夥賬簿並檢查其事務及財產之權，然而如上所述，此種塲合，合夥必為二人以上所組織，其他合夥人旣未與附股者直接發生關係，何能受其附股契的之拘束，而容忍其檢閱，此其特異之點，又屬顯而易見者也，　，隱名合夥人分袒損失之責任，原則上僅以其所出之資額為　，此在我國民法第七百零三條定有明文，故其責任類似兩合公司之有限責任股束，於出資限度以外，不負分担損失之義務，反之，附股者分扭損失之責任，苟無特別的定，通常即以其出資額之比例為準，故有附股當時出資原極少數，一旦合夥事業失敗，分担損失為數甚鉅者，不能如隱名合夥人所負損失之責任為有限也，依據上述種種之區別，附股者與隱名合夥之不能混為一談，當為商界諸公所領解，至於區別之實益，則以隱名合夥之責任，較附股為輕，而其得檢閱合夥賬簿及財產之權利，轉較附股為優，殊有宜傳推行之必要，况自民法第六百八十一條公布施行以來，商界之有資產者，方惴惴焉於連帶負責之危險，不敢投資，立法當局，經各團體之請願，雖有提議修正或另訂單行法規以資救濟者，然以種種窒礙，迄未實現，則推行隱名合夥，亦未始非一時權宜之處置也。</p>

<p>體育消息　二萬球迷相顧失色　國軍竟敗於西聯　結果三比二上半時二比零　全隊表演不如第一日精彩　　我國參加世運之足球代表隊、第一日旣以六比一大勝葡萄牙、昨日復在市體育場戰上海西聯隊、竟於大出意料之外、以三比二受挫、上半時以二比零落後、致使二萬球迷、不特掃興、亦目相顧愕然、昨日之陣錢、較第一日稍有變更、加入新自港到滬之曹桂成張顯源、中衛綫亦小有變更、然而全隊之表演、反因之較第一日减色、西聯方面、確甚可取、允以守門鮑賽仲、博得全場一致之贊賞、茲記戰情如下、　　逆風作戰表演減色　　中華隊昨日之失敗、可分述之如下、上半時逆風作戰、球出不遠、異常費力而困難、致被西聯先聲奪人、連中二隻，於氣勢上、不無影響、下半時李惠堂極有把握射無不中之十二碼球、竟發中門柱彈回、其後反被混進一球、其間出人二球之多、不幸一至於極、至於前鋒綫、張顯源似尙不如卓石金之靈活、每失之交臂、技術上、無可諱飾的較為遜色、曹桂成亦不若楊水益之年靑矯健、於是前鋒半面、頓時失去進攻上之效力、馮李二人則為軋許雷米迪所因、中衛綫亦較第一日為差、李國威不如前日之陳鎮和、陳　和不如前日之梁榮照、足見將來在正式陣綫上、尙有考慮之價值、此不過失敗之幾個原因而巳、　　西聯守門有聲有色　　西人方面之表演、亦有不可忽視者、我人初以為西聯必不如葡萄牙、因烏合之眾、不料既非烏合、且打來有聲有色、老將不老、攻守咸宜、鮑賽仲風頭獨健、不少不可避免之球、經其一一挽救、守衛綫亦穩固非凡、前鋒除福恩　弱外、個個生龍活虎、戰略亦極有方、各個守衛、異常嚴密、中堅對付中鋒、兩衛禦兩翼、兩輔阻兩內鋒、中華五鋒、一時效力大减、聯絡亦失、故昨日西聯守衛上之嚴密周到、毫不放鬆情形、為昨日西聯獲勝之主因也、　　一失二雙元氣大傷　　觀奢稍邊第一日、的計兩萬、擲毫結果、西聯得順風之利、自北南攻、吳鐵城市長行開球禮後、兩隊開始接觸、西聯得風勢之助、進攻不巳、門前時見敵踪、李譚兩衛奮勇肅淸、幸告無事、但門前危狀、並不稍解、小華特極為活動、福恩之角球、風大出界、未曾闖事、接戰的五分鐘小華特自邊而進、鮑賽利傳霍和、包家平送出欠遠、鮑休脫覓得隙縫舉足一脚、嗖的進網、禍不單行、球始終盤旋我軍禁地、險不脫、李惠堂葉北華雖有數度攻門、未見成效、小華特傳球又自左邊進襲、一傳送中、鮑賽利良機不失、向門角一送、包家平猛撲欲救、人雖仆地、球却進入網底、西聯驟然在十分鐘內、以二比零佔光、太出羣衆意外、　　反攻之下徒費心機　　我軍開始作猛烈之攻撲、李馮並　進攻、以張顯源之失足、無功而退、葉北華傳李惠堂、單槍匹馬、亦未成就曹桂成猛衝、鮑賽仲撲地而救、其狀至險、為霍格踢出、惠堂又作孤軍之深入、始終不得志、脚頭雖好、無奈鮑賽仲之救球、亦恰好棋逢敵手、馮　祥依樣葫蘆、徒然空費心機、無濟於事、上半時結局、仍為二比零、　　一得一失依然落後　　下半時陣地變換、風勢亦易、西聯開球、我軍得風勢之助、一鼓而下、果然聲色不同、情狀頓異、西聯陣地、全是我軍天下、間或一時稍退、轉瞬又進逼黃龍、七八分鐘之際、李惠堂斜身一送、葉北華如飛而進、橫射過塲、曹桂成候個正着、中央一送馮景祥遂一撥而中、觀衆之呼聲、隨之大起、時局稍見起色、挽回似現希望、一再角球、無所建樹、不料霍和帶球從中而進、譚江柏一舉失足、連人帶球、冲抵門邊、反身一勾、鮑賽利趕上送進、又失一城、仍以三比一落後、球場雜寫　　自六屆全國運動會後，昨天是我第一次光臨市體青塲的大看豪，面目如故。全運盛况，又浮湧在我的腦海，心田裹頓時掀起一種說不出的感　！一維偉，壯嚴，獨步全國；，」我不希望祗給我一　影像，我祈求着能够常有機會踏上這體育界的偉大築建物。　　這兩天球賽的號召力，真有意想不到的功效、申　已擠提我筋骨酸痛。市體育場的熱鬧，當然也在意料中的。地方雖大，可是人究竟有愛　的靈性，南北兩端的看臺，留下足可容三萬人的空座，兩邊却擠軋得立錐無地、尤其一元座中，像個蜂果。人數並不比申園少。　　當我出發的時候。是下午二點鐘、車經北河南路寶山路的交界處，交通為汽車塞斷、這些車子十分之十是向市中心區去的。滬淞路上的火車，裝滿着球國迷民，很笨重地拖着徐徐前進，車開的時候，寳山路的交通便暫時斷絕。我們的車子乃繞大圈子從靶子路折入北四川路，兜至江灣路。去的汽車都載滿了人，來的車子都是空空的；往來不絕如校。風，因汽車的疾駛，增加它的反動力，猛烈地襲進車窗，我不絕地打着寒噤，絲毫感不到春的溫情。　　用了全身之力，擠入一元座中，找至看台之一角的記者席，可是四周欄杆圍住，不得其門而入。詢何故，曰：不知；不得巳而向欄杆下鑽了過去。忽父覺得記者席中那麼淸閑舒適，面子上滿得意似的。舉目遙瞻司令台，有無數佩黃綢帶子的職員們，忙著招待「兩元」的貴賓，還得找引對號的坐位、又回想我自己向人　裏擠進去，從欄杆裏鑽過來的，不覺啞然失笑。勢力，權威，義務；人便是這三種心理合組的動物，永遠是這樣矛盾呵！　　風，真大得可以：女客們的頭髮，被風吹得四散披覆在頭上，衣衫被風緊地揪在一邊；球場裏的人們頭上的呢帽，東拋落一頂，西拋落一頂；無事忙，在球場上這帽子，也怪有趣的。　　人逐漸多起來，六角與一元座原祗隔一排鉛絲網，到了不得意的時候，六角座裏的人們因羨慕一元座的高貴，都紛紛跳躍而過。前排一的人立了起來，後面的人視綫被遮蔽了，於是發出嫉妬而帶有恐嚇性的「坐下來」底叫喊聲，這「來」的後聲拖得很長，距離二百公尺對面的看豪上底叫聲，這邊可以聽得很淸楚；這邊的喊聲，那邊諒亦同樣可以聽到；四周不絕地發出這樣的叫喊，隨着風勢的緩急傳來的聲喊，聲調也就有了高下頓挫，其聲甚悲，不禁令我想起，賈克倫敦的一部名著「ＸＸ的呼聲」。　　戰罷歸來，從市心區到虹口公園一段長路上的汽車，首尾相接，像水車似的行進，不知經過了多久。公共汽車，火車，出差汽車，與投機的運貨車，不知到什麼時候纔把數萬球迷肅淸。　　十二碼球萬分可惜　　局勢至此、希望又減、主師乃下令變更陣勢、以譚江柏出調前鋒、居張願源之位、張則退任右輔、陳鎭和坐鎭中央、梁榮照後調、以冀背城而借一、攻勢果然頭見得手、尚餘十五分鐘之際、霍格在綫內觸手犯規、判罰十二碼球、一時喜從天降、惠堂又十拿九穩、尚有一綫生機、豈知喜出望外、惠學過於用心、反將球踢中門柱、一塲空歡喜、亡羊補牢、幸虧葉北華　絕妙角球、直接送進網去、追成三比二、奈何時間不待、而西聯之守衛益嚴、角球再角球、事終不可為、代表隊敗矣、田徑訓練班　今日測驗　參加共十九人　　北平廿六日電、世運田徑訓練班、二十七日下午在清華測驗、參加十九人、擬定自百公尺起順序舉行、馬約翰談、選手無論成績優劣、二十七日均須測騐、香港尋常杯　南華南獲冠軍　　香港二十日電、二十五日尋常杯、中華以零比零和西警隊、同時香港會以一比四敗於砲兵、成績落後、故中華獲亞軍、至冠軍則屬南華南、輔仁東遊球隊　籃球敗於早大　四十一比三十七　　北平輔仁大學等學生組織之足球籃球隊、一行共計二十九人、由敎授二人率領、赴日作友誼比賽、於二十一日自天津乘日郵船長江丸動身、據日文報載、巳於廿五日午前八時抵東京、寄宿日本靑年會館、定今日起開始與東京各强隊比賽、同盟社東京二十六日電、華北學生籃球隊已於二十六日午後三時在神宮球場與早稻田大學比賽、結果以四十一對三十七、被早大隊擊敗、其成績如左、大雨傾盆一塲水戰　東華昨在京勝業餘　結果五比一今日退滬　　南京二十六日電，滬東華足球隊與京業餘隊、二十六日下午三時半、在勵志社作友誼賽、上半時雙方實力平均、各無所獲、下半時業餘仍能支持、最後十五分鐘、大雨傾盆、塲地泥濘、業餘不慣水戰、顧尙動罰中十二碼後、曹秋亭戴麟經相繼建功、業餘劉祖修報回一球後、張金海藉十二碼機會、再加一只終了時、曹秋亭再建一功、結果五比一、東華大勝、東華定二十七日下午五時乘車返滬、失敗的檢討　　天時反常，忽陰忽晴，忽暖忽寒，令人感到大大的不安。二十五日中國出席世運足球選手在明媚的春光中，以六比一大勝葡萄牙，球迷歡天喜地，看一個飽，眞快人快事也！咸以為昨天中國隊對西聯在市體育塲的比賽，一定有更滿意的欣賞，而艮市體育塲是那麽偉大壯麗，决不致過分擁擠，可以舒舒適適地看個暢快。那料到忽然刮起大風，陽光歛跡，人人驟然父感到老大的美中不足；這還不算，偏偏中國隊不爭氣，還沒出國，先吃敗仗：二比三，失望和懊喪的情緒，溢於每位球迷的言　　昨天中國隊的陣綫，滿以為很靠得住；張願源曹桂成等都於昨日上午抵滬，行裝甫卸，下午就出塲比賽。全局沒有見到二人有一决滿意的表演，幾使人疑為道不是第一等選手。這是不是旅途勞頓的緣故？觀此情形，反不如卓石金與楊水益。張顯源益顯出平庸的姿態，耳聞不如目覩，球迷咸認為失望　　與葡萄牙一戰，李惠堂受雷米狄和谷司坦的監視，發不出威勢。，但有馮景祥的調濟進攻仍能攻破防綫，而得到滿淤的結果。昨日李又遇見雷米狄，李縱然加倍努力，仍不得如願以償。更以馮景祥巳成為敵人的危險物，昨由軋許嚴加防犯，活動的機會，也就不如前日。葉北華表演尙佳，亦屬徒然。　　中衛綫的軟弱，是昨日失敗的主因：黃美順未出塲，改以梁榮照，平平而巳。李國威亦不過　爾。陳鎭和鋒芒如故。從這兩塲比賽觀察的結果，中衛綫仍以陳鎮和為最佳，梁樹棠雖沒有出塲，其實力與戰略，可確定在李國威之上。　　內衛李天生與譚江柏最大的毛病，就是離球門太遠，往往返顧不及，陳飽和着實顯了些援救的工作。包家平的守門，也已遠不如前，地位與判別力，每有不能應付裕如之概。第二球的攻人，非不可援救，在乎仆地與球進門的時間不當。遠遠看去，球已滾到身下，他纔仆地，巳來不及了。　　此外第三隻球的失敗，眼見那　和帶球飛奔而來，李天生譚江拍梁榮照三人，在左右後三方面拚命窮追，竟阻不住他，被他直衝至門下，一踢而進，包家平至此也沒有辦法了。這也是專注於攻，疏略於守，至時機急迫，後顧莫及了。然而鮑沙利的技能，的確值得讚佩，不愧為歷屆埠際賽的名將，據說他的年齡恐遺不到二十歲呢。　　西聯前鋒的銳利，記者巳於昨日提及，五人中允以右翼小華特與左內鋒　沙利最出色，幾决美麗的遲送與衡刺，眞够佩服，引球的快捷，中國隊不免相形見拙。　軋許雖老，依舊有他老的經騐。老成持重，應付周密，部位决判非常準確謹愼；與左右兩輔和二內衛，都能聯合一致對抗，不容有些破綻，也很少見中國隊前鋒有一决穩穩當當的攻門。曹桂成葉北華雖曾有幾引球直抵門側，要不是射成野球，終不容你有機可乘。　　守門白賽仲應付的穩健，救出險球無數。表演遠在包家平之上。　　開場中國先占逆風，這是大大的不幸。踢出去的球，被風吹回，這不是人力可能挽回的。於是球勢的控制，完全失去把握。十分鍊內，竟連失兩球。以後極力振作，祇圖一個相持的局面。假使開始中國占順風之利，我想西聯的遭遇，也就要一如中國了，或者失敗的紀錄，猶不止此。下半時中國隊極力反攻，西聯也加緊防禦。二比一後，反又被西聯攻入一球。以後中國隊因急於求勝，球勢反不如意，這是必然之理。最後雖在一面倒之形勢下，終不能破門而入，反敗為勝。　　批評一個失敗的球隊，往往不免言過其詞，記者當亦不能吾認犯此毛病。就大體觀察，中國隊的失敗，當在試騐各球員的技巧，故陣綫不能一憑理想支配。其次技術上固有不能否認的缺點，然非不能取勝，實因幸運不佳而已。無謂的誹議，大可不必。王士林創跳遠全國記錄　成績六公尺九四　　北平廿六日電、平體專春運會、今閉幕、跳遠王士林以六公尺九四破全國郝春德保持之紀錄、三級跳遠王亦以十四公尺零六、破司徒光保持之十三公尺九四華北紀錄、公開晚秋表演賽　卡遜挫安德羅　安氏抽球甚佳以場地不熟受挫雙打表演平平僅賽兩盤即中止　　本埠新嘉坡路中國網球會、昨日特邀請來滬遊歷之新西閘合盃網球隊長安德羅、曁加洲網球名手哥克二人、與滬上網球名手卡遜德孚作單雙打公　表演於該會球塲、作壁上觀者、的三百餘人、比賽結果、卡遜以二比一壓倒安德羅、安氏球藝頗不弱、底綫抽球、允見精彩、惟以塲地不熟、回球出界甚多、遂為身手靈活之卡遜擊敗、雙打安德羅與德孚搭配、戰卡遜岢克、哥克球藝較差、而火氣又重、而德孚則攔網劈殺、勇不可擋、卡遜哥克速敗兩盤、戰來鮮見精采、時天寒風緊、祗賽兩局而止、成績如下、中西手球今日秩序　　朱寬　對　安特浮斯　六時　　琪掰令　對　却開令　六時半　　白內脫　對　蘭金　七時

<p>經濟專刊非常時期之財政  張一凡　　　租稅呢？公債呢？　　在歐戰之中，各國為籌措戰費的政策問題，曾引起普通的論爭。戰爭局面的展開，戰費需求的日大，時間條件的迫切，使各國的財政當局都深切的感到棘手。因歷年備戰的支出，資本蓄積的惡果，平時的財政問題，都亟亟不可終日，何况在此非常時期，又何况有此非常的要求！　　古代及中世紀，戰費的支付，大部分都靠他平時的庫藏蓄積而輔以租稅勒捐與徵發。戰勝者，又可用戰利品及賠欵作塡補。及後公共信用發達，特別在十八世紀中葉之後，公債　巳替代了儲積庫藏的地位。租稅的目的，此時便僅供給付債息，或用作還債基金。　　　但公債的募集，雖能　速而收入較鉅，但其本身，具有膨脹信用的缺點。而且購買公債，叉等於投資。馬克思說，這是資產階級蓄積資本的一種方法，　實屬至理。因此戰時財政，如果仰賴於公債，則一面是廣大的勞苦人民，在前綫喋血，為國犧牲；或在後方節衣縮食，努力勞働。而一面却有少數資產階級，在後方坐食厚利，乘機發財。等到戰事結束，一般人民或不能不納付沉重的租稅，以淸償國債。這種現象，最易激起不平之鳴，造成社會人心騷動的趨勢。所以資產階級，也覺得問題嚴重，不可隨便。於是戰費的支出，究以公債為抵補呢？還是用租稅抵補呢？便成了紛爭的中心。　　　陳塞列格曼　E．R．A．Selfgman撥勒亨C．C．Plehn專，主張戰時的支出，應單獨以公債應付。因為公債是加負担於將來，同時又可减少戰時人民對於增稅上的直接苦痛，還能避免租稅壓迫戰時工商業之惡果，俾其得以不斷地供給戰爭以所需的物力　。而德法兩國政府，且以為公債不是人民的最終負担，將來不難取償於敵人。所以戰費之籌措手段，幾全靠公債。德國所募之戰債，佔戰費總額的百分之一〇四又四之鉅。法國所募戰債的比例，也達戰費總額的百分之一〇〇又三。這情形，不特表示他們的戰費全部，皆靠着公債。而且還表示其他的費用，一部份也由公債支付。但結果，德國是敗北，非特無法取償於敵人，而且還要被人敲索鉅額賠欵。國家信用，根本崩潰。法國則硬索賠欵，不惜以武力為後盾。因此戰事雖巳結束，糾紛依然存在；軍費支出，依然續增。在國內都又養成索賠欵，不加稅的輿論；使財政陷入極度的混亂　。　　　英國的披谷A．C．Pigon　美國的石蒲拉格O．M．W．Sprngne都蘭得E．Dane　Duran　等，則以為戰費須以租稅來應付　。因為租稅可以防止信用膨脹的擾亂社會經濟，可以避免戰費負擔的利害不均，可以不混亂財政制度。這種說法，原極具價值。惟以戰時財政的要件，是在迅速收入，及有鉅額欵項。租稅比較困難。所以統觀歐戰中各國稅收的結果，與戰費的比率，類皆很低。英國的稅收成績較好，但戰事第一年不過僅百分之七　。其後雖增，總平均仍不過百分之二十　。而有賴於公債者，却占百分之七十五又三　。美國的稅收成績雖是吏好，而為百分之三十一又七：但國債對一般戰費總額的比例，都佔百分之八十又六　。至於其他各國，則法幽在戰時所徵之稅，甚至不足以供平時的經常開支；意大利之新稅收，不過供支付戰債之利息。德國則連付利之數也不足，　　其他各國，更莫不如此。　　　有人主張，戰費的支出，應全部由租稅維持，庶不擾亂財政金融，避免信用膨脹，惟當新稅未豐之前的過渡時期，可暫由借欵應付　　。此種辦法，原則上為公衆所承認，事實上也為各國當局所採行。但戰事延長，借債政策，也就不得不繼續使用，結果，其欲作有限制的通貨膨脹，事實上依然無力限制。觀歐戰時英美兩國積極採用租稅政策的實蹟可知，　　　還有少數英國人，主張創立一種永久租稅　Limpot　Dermant　，藉此以維持戰時戰後之一切公共經費　　。這是出發於軍稅制論點，而戴上軍國主義思想的政策。但資本社會中資本蓄積過程的存在，無論如何，要使某項租稅，能以具有如此寬大的伸縮能力，總是沒有希望的。　　　當美國參戰之初，財長麥克圖S．Mocadoor曾主張戰費支出，租稅與公　平均分配。換言之，即戰費支出，一半靠租稅的收人，一半靠公債的收入。　　但事實上要守住這種合配的限界是辦不到的。理由和第三種主張的不可能相同，所以在麥克圓時代，在一九一七年份，經費由欵稅支出者约佔百分之五五，至一九一八年—即參戰以後之一年度，稅欵之比例，已减速為百分之三一又六。　　　　　在戰爭結束之前，法國有人主張，一切經常專用，應由稅收應付，至於軍費及年金等，則以公債應付。　　這種預算的割據，在財政制度上旣非善策；而且其實際效果，還不　是一面增稅與一面舉債嗎？　　本來，這些問題，都隨各國的環境和實情而有不同的。譬如法國，在戰爭展開後，便為敵人侵入，被侵的地方雖屬不大，可是都屬經濟上重要的區域。所以他的稅源，本就引起恐慌。同時，在他的社會階層中，食利線階級，素來為數不少。所以全持公債之說，正可以代表他們政府背後的勢力所在。至於德國，原是軍國主義最猖獗的國家。對於上次磊戰，抱必勝的决心。所以募集公債，類乎給人民以有保障的投資一樣。至於美國，則因對恊约國的戰債投資，巳很多了，所以對本國的財政負擔，便想向人民大衆身上去榨取，這正是表明他是新興資本主義國家的本色。而英國，則因其租稅制度，比別國未得健全；所以社會的可稅能力，也具有很大的伸縮性。依賴租稅的主張，原非憑空妄想。　　　國內論見的探討　　現在，我們也被迫着要來硏究這些問題了。可是，且把一切利害關係拋開不說，但從實際上的能力來講：那末要想加稅，則平時的捐稅，已使人力不勝負；要發公伏，社會的浙資，傾其所有，也不知能維持戰爭幾天的費用？因為，我國人民的所得，比人家低得多；我國社會的游資，比人家少得多；我國的稅制，又不健全；我國的信用機構，又不現代化。這一切，都說明了我國的戰時資源，巳空虛萬分；我國財政的伸縮力，又薄弱得可憐。平時的財政預算，尙在朝不保暮，寅吃卯糧；何况碰上這個非常要求。所以目前國內朝野，對於這問題雖有不少意見發表，但大家都沒有一個妥當的辦法，因此各人的態度，幾乎一致抱着一不論何種財源，只要有所收入：不論多寡，不計利害，唯取是圖」。如:　　馬寅初氏等主張以所得稅為主要收入，必要時再作限制的紙幣政策，並發少數公債以資補充。　　與此意見相同者，有朱光澤等。　　　　所得稅確是一咱最好的稅制。但問題是在大部分人民的所得，微乎其微，能有多少可供國用？主要收入旣無多大希望，　欲作有限制的紙幣政策，結果只有無限制的膨脹。欲發行有限制的公債，結果也惟有無限的發行。所以理論雖極合財政的原則，效果卻非走上違心之路不可。將來也就只有依賴危險的紙幣政策，和公債政策相終始。所謂「所得稅為主要收入，」蕭淑宇說他是「畫餅充飢」，不為過甚。　　，　　　戰費的支出，由加稅及慕債同時維持之。而券伙又以內外債並舉。至於紙幣政策，則絕對反對。這是衛挺生氏等的主張。　　，還有某君，在經濟季刋上幾乎全部抄　衛著之戰時財政一書而附和之。　　　，然則加稅與募債，若沒有其他先决條件，與適當準備，結果，一面是重徵暴歛，民不堪命；而收入仍屬無幾；一面則信用之膨脹，依然形成紙幣之汜濫世界。以為歐戰時各國敎訓之所在。　　　朱偰氏則以為中國戰時財政的出路，當從有負担能力，而對國家向無直接負担者方面着想。他的日標，是在舉辦，　，市地價稅，土地增值稅；　，銀行收益稅。然則此項收入，為數極為有限，朱氏亦明知之。故又擬根本辦法十種；　，籌辦戰事瓤利稅，　，籌辦享樂稅，　，提高奢侈品稅率，　，提高印花稅，　，提高郵資，　，按財產分配，實微救國捐：　，自由慕捐；　，籌借外債；　，必要時實行紙幣政策；　，减少不必要之支出。二二，然稅收部份，類皆收入微細，且將擾民極大。徵捐部分，非易於辦理而收效小（白由募捐是），便是效雖大而難辦（救國捐是）。至於籌措外債，債主何在，先是問題，紙幣政策，則危險極大。　　我以為，戰時租稅政策，亦應「力避苛細」及「最小犧牲」之原則，公債和紙幣，同為危險極大的政策，但以國富遠强我國之歐美，尙且難免，何况我國。不過如何使之减少危險，如何使之安全與公允，才是主要問題。總之，我們籌措戰費上務須堅持的態度是：「如何在可能範圍，安全限度內，迅速集中大批欵項，以應付戰爭上的需要；而能又有恃　久性之能力。一凡惟求　的，不擇手段，這畢竟不是辦法，如果飲鴆止渴，貿然行之，則其危險之大，或將與戰爭相同。因為要確保戰事的勝利，需具　人力Mau　物力Munton　及　財力Money三者缺一不可。　　戰時財政政策，如能得大量牧入，單巳完成其對戰爭之責任。但如因不擇手段，致激起社會上的騷動，失去了「人力」中「一致對外」「作戰决心」的條件，結果即使不被戰爭打敗，也將被財政打敗。「打敗德國的不是戰爭，而是軍隊中的革命情緒。」這句名言，財政當局是應該深切留意的。　　戰車所眞正需要的不是貨幣，而是物力，物力在不斷的生產，與順利的生產之下，始可以不斷的供給戰用。戰爭巳給予生產以極大阻力，如果財政上再給他一種壓力，這是自取滅亡的辦法。租稅政策，公債政策，對於生產，都等於一把兩面銳利的刀。一面可以替他斬除荊棘，一面却可取他的生命。全在看如何使用的方法。　　貨幣只是使戰事獲得必要物力的一種中介；並不是戰時財政所主要的目的。只要信用機構健全，使行手段得法，那末可以不成問題的。因此，我們的經濟能力，無力如英美學者一般地去選擇戰時財源，究應由租稅支付戰費？還是由公債支付戰費？等等這簡純的問題。為了我們的資源貧乏，多方吸收這辦法是不錯的，而且也是必要的。我們所成問題的，究用何種方法，能以避免各種好能發生的危險，而處於「安全限界」之內。不過，一般人總把紙幣政策，視作最後不得巳的辦法，所以本文姑將這問題放開，專討論我們戰時對於租稅和公債應取如何的政策。　　　戰時的租稅政策　　現在，我們先來討論戰時的租稅政策。　　戰時實行租稅政策，有四大顯著的優點：　對於物價方面：間接稅雖可使物價因轉嫁而抬高，但其力量較信用膨脹為微。（然總以避免為上策）直接稅大都不能轉嫁，故與物價毫無影響。物價不飛漲，（在戰時，物價的增漲，為需要增加，及不可免的信用膨脹之故，總是不可免的。）則一方面是人心較定，生計較易；一方面是戰時工業，亦得順利進行。　對於物力方面：减少消費，以供戰用；為戰時實在資源之一。　　　，加稅結果，無形中限制人民之消費。有益於戰爭。　對於財政方面：公債實際上即為未來的租稅；且為表示國家信用起見，舉債同時，即設新稅，或提高稅率，以為償體付本息之基金。故在財政上，只是飲鴆止渴，使負擔增加。租稅則無條件割取國民所得之一部份，故在政府，並不增加負擔；在人民，事實上反等於减輕公債利息的負擔。　對於社會方面：債易於激起社會上之不平；稅制的負擔，只要合於犧牲均等的原則，則可得大部份民衆之擁護；即有反感者，亦僅一小部份資產階級。故不足以影響大局。　　但租稅亦有兩大缺點：　舉辦租稅，收效較緩，不合於戰時上之急切需要，　租稅之負擔，加於現在。故為國民所得限制：收入難豐。如果稅制不良，則尤易激起社會人心之騷動，無削减社會之經濟生產能力。　　此由租稅理論上言之，至於依我國的實際情形而論，租稅政策之不足以解决整個戰費問題，理由更多。主要的是：　國民所得較大，亦即稅收較豐的地方，必在生產業發達的都市，我國的最大都市，如上海，天津，濟南，靑島，無錫，漢口，廣州，汕頭，厦門，寗波，杭州等地，不是在沿海，便是在沿江，有的巳陷於敵人的勢力之下，有的亦為敵人所準備奪取的地方。所以戰爭一旦發生，上列各地，皆有相繼為敵人佔領的可能。因此，現有的鹽統關三大財源，已非我有；何况再能掘取其他新稅源。　我國生產落後，國民所得極微。以現狀而論，除繳納租稅外，生計都巳成了問題。　近年社會經濟恐慌的打擊，百業凋蔽；尤以農村經濟，更為凄慘。　租稅資源，分佈各地：在征收制度腐敗不堪的我國，在平時尙不能涓滴　公，若不嚴密監督，戰時情形，必更不堪。　因政治上的割據而形成經濟上的割據，目前又橫行在封建勢力膨脹的各省。因此截留，扣稅，迄未歛跡，此雖係政治上的問題，不得不擱置不問，但也不能不在我們考慮之中。　　所以我們的戰時租稅政策，除政治問題須用政洽方法解决之外，在財政立場上：一方應盡力發揮其優點：在此目的之下，先要以培植國家資源的基礎。戰事所需要的是物力，國民所需要的是「所得」，獲得此項效果的手段，惟有增加生產。所以增加生產，披谷認為是戰時的主要資源之一。　　　，在生產落後，且又凋蔽不堪的我國，在此非常時期，惟有實行國防經濟建設。建設經費的來源，當由膨脹信用得來。　　　，　因其生產有代價，故應以投資性質的公債得之。　可避免一般人民，除被利潤壓迫外復受加稅的負擔。　同時此種信用膨脹，並無流弊。因膨脹而抬高之物價，仍被增加生產所壓低。　　另一方面：應竭力避免其缺點。在此目的之下，應切實根據「最小犧牲」及「犧牲均等」的原則。此兩項原則，並不相逆。前者是使人民受「最小犧牲」的負擔額；後者是使人民負擔的分配，合於實質上的「犧牲之均等」。所以此種「均等」，不是均分負擔，也不是比例負擔，而是累進的給各階級以犧牲上實質的均等，使租稅制度，能以發揮調整分配的作用，方能避免其缺點為能事。　　根據上述的原則及特殊情形，我們對於租稅政策，及其相關的政策，主張：　　　開辦較平時更強調之累進所得稅。遺產稅。財富稅。盈餘稅（土地增價稅，戰時盈餘稅，過分盈利等等皆在內）。至於如奢侈稅。享樂稅。則在戰時之消費統制下，早失去其我源之資格；故可無須再增稅率，惟以我國情形特殊，或有酌增之可能。　　　改良征收制度，嚴密監督管理；征收手段，實物與貨幣並用。如田賦，及有關戰用之產銷稅，有關專賣之產銷稅等等，皆可採用實物征收制度，所得稅，遺產稅，財富稅，盈餘稅等等，則可按情形而仍用貨幣徵收制度。　　採用實物征收制之主要優點有四：（甲）可直接將收入供戰用及公賣，（乙）可帮助戰時之物價統制政策的進行，（丙）可减少稅吏舞弊中飽之機會，因中飽實物較中飽貨弊困難。（丁）一可避免生產者受商業資本之壓迫與剝削，惟其一缺點亦有：（甲）征收費或將增加，（乙）保管及一收解的手續較煩，（丙）運輸費時，然則此項缺點，亦不難防止：（甲）實行實物的滙兌，（乙）一運輸交通國營，（丙）實行物價統制，（丁）廣設國管商場，詳細辦法，容作專論。　　　酌量採用包稅制度，為應付戰時上的迫急支出，對於收和緩慢的租稅，或可採用包稅制度。惟其流弊，易於使包商狐假虎威，苛擾民間。故不妨組織商辦官督之租稅公司，除承包征稅外，又可承銷國庫券，包稅制度成立，在徵牧經費上可得以减輕，此項减輕所得者，用作為承包利益之最大限度，似較為妥善。　　　辦理金銀珠寳飾物美術品古玩等等奢侈品之登記。必要時實行徵發，沒收，或收買。此項收人，用作抵消國際貸借上之代價的一部。我深信如能辦理得法，收入額必有可觀。惟須在上海對外運輸交通未隔絕前，始有實行之價值，而此騷擾亦必不堪。　　　實施大規模之公賣政策，以抵補鹽稅，統稅，關稅等受戰爭影響之損失。如食鹽，煤油，煤，火柴，茶，絲，糖，桐油，烟，酒，甚至於棉花，小麥，等等。除食鹽，烟，酒，及火柴等四種外，其他皆與國際貿易有重大關係者。故亦應一律列為公賣品範圍內。至於烟酒之生產與消費，在戰時應竭力取締或限制。以便挪用此項消費資本，供戰時之資源。故實已失其公賣之價值。惟仍應列為公賣範圍。　　　為便利上述各項計劃之進行，及適應戰時經濟之非常狀態，故應即速實行戰時經濟統制政策，及從事於國防經濟之建設。此項經費，由膨脹政府信用籌集之。　　　因經濟建設之效果，物力生產得以增加，國民所得得以提高，社會乃入繁榮，戰時資源，便可取之不竭。於是一方面；戰事所需之物力，大部得以自給；略可增加經濟封鎖之抵抗能力。另一方面：則使公共經費之支出，其中屬於消耗性者（如為契的關係而讓與外國人者）可以漸减；而屬於移轉性者（為契約或義務關係而讓與本國人者）得日以增加；使社會資源，作順態之流轉。　　　　　此外勒捐，徵發，亦可隅一為之；惟郵政加價，印花稅率提高，營業掊率提高等等，則以免用為宜。一因收入不大，二因可以轉嫁，三因與上述新徵重徵各稅，形成複稅。勢皆重苦民生。具在創辦新稅，或新增稅率時，應力強打擊戰時工業之生產。否則，又將得不償失。　　　戰時的公債政策　　進而可討論我們戰時的公債政策了。　　戰費之籌措，以「迅速」與「鉅額」為二大要件。沒有備戰儲金的國家，應付戰時的緊急支出，捨公債外，別無他法。可稅能力强的國家，以後的戰費，尙且不能全恃租稅。可稅能力弱的，更不消說。所以，這是事實問題；值得討論的，也只是如何使之安全的方法問題。　　前已言之，公債政策，含有極大的危險性。主要者是：一，形成信用膨脹，以致造成通貨膨脹。二，增加財政負担，以致財政成為債權人的私　分配行政；三，增加人民對公債本息上不當的負担；四，增加資本集中與蓄積的過程，而强調社會分配上的不均；五，違反財政上「犧牲均等」的原則。　　然則：一方面旣有非發分債以資彌補不可的趨勢；另一方面，又有造成社會經濟不安的矛盾；旣不可因　廢食，又不能飲鴆止渴；唯一辦法，只有從比較一安全的限界」內去求出路　　關於公債政策的「安全限界」，我以為須備下列四大條件：　　一，信用的發行，有自動調節的能力；則不致擾亂金融，影響物價。如公管企業經費取諸於信用，便有這種自動調節的可能。如外債，雖無調節力，然亦無破壞力。　　二，緩和資本蓄積和集中的過程，這是重要的，但社會制度不翻個身是不可能的。所以目前只能說「緩和。」我以為：在戰時，不應以推銷公債而採用高利，免稅等等手段去引誘。這不特有害財政本身，而且實在也不必要，因為戰時人民購藏公債，要比儲藏幣貸來得穩當。一則適當的宣傳，也可喚起人民的愛國心，以助公債的發行。公債免稅，實是破壞財富稅體系的敵人。無論在平時都使不得。此外，我以為，在戰後的財政整理時期，為减輕財政負担　見，創辦一種一償債特別捐A．specialdebt－redempionlevyl，按人民的納稅能力，在一定的免稅限度上，依個人的純寫net　Weath　（乃指資本而非牧入）以累進法課之。繳納期限應短，　納的手段可允許用公債證券。這種特別捐之創立，戰後的英國，有很多人主張的。如道爾頓H．Dalton　還以為這是「至少可以代表安坐家中的人，納還與奔馳於戰場而失去經濟機會的人們之一種道德債。」　　　。　　三，竭力防止政府信用與銀行信用的聯繫。如我國今日各種公債條例，都規定公債票得為銀行發行紙幣的保證準備。因此政府信用膨脹的結果，即造成銀行之紙幣膨脹，欲使戰時之政府信用，亦有相當膨脹之可能，以應戰時迫不得巳時之需要，則需先行變更公債條例，至少取消戰時公債亦可用作保證準備之法律資格，以割斷政府信用與銀行信用之聯繫；始可使此等政府信用，在相當膨脹後，仍可獲得在安全之限界內。　　四，竭力防止政府信用，越出社會消化公債之飽和能力，因為這種結果，不是使公債備用，立即動搖；便是在通貨膨脹之後，與貨幣信用，以至於整個的金融機構，同時破產，因為公債超出了社會消化力之外，中央銀行便將消失其維持債市價格（即信用）的統御力量。不論持券人為投機之目的，或換取某種資本的目的，在市塲上吐出鉅額公債，而市塲無力消化，以致造成跌價風潮：中央銀行無力維持，即表示政府無力維持信用，信用動搖，競相售出，此風一起，即成一發不可收拾之勢。如中央銀行增發紙幣，以求維持債市；結果幣制犧牲了，公債却仍同歸於盡。尤其在戰時，政府信用，最易動搖；市塲空氣，也最易混亂。所以風潮的危機，隨時都有。政府的信用，是可以决定戰爭勝敗的；所以絕對不能冒險。如果我們的戰時公債政策，在這樣的安全限界內活動，那末不管他用什麽方式發行，都可再無異議了。　　不過，講到發行的方式時，我想提出兩種特殊公債，請大家研究。在我以為：這是最適宜在戰時提倡的。　　　採用民間狀元會的方式，發行一種特種公債，目的是在提倡人民的减少消費，挪借節的所得，移充戰用。故可名之白節的公債。略給輕微的利息，規定相當長的期限；在人民方面，等於儲蓄：故又可名之謂戰時儲蓄公債。但此種公債，並不自由慕捐，却按各人的財富而攤認；故又與英國戰時的節約券，與各國採行的儲蓄券不同。且不可在市場上出售，期滿時一次　清。此種辦法之優點：　有勒捐一般地收入相當鉅欵的可能，而無勒捐一般地使人民感到被奪取所得時的苦痛之深。　有一般公債的效能，但無一般公債的缺點；因為他不能在市場上出售，利率又低，所以旣無引起信用風潮的危險，又不過分增加財政的負擔。　性質上與所得稅相似，但所得稅納後不還：而這個却仍能收回：故發行上較征收所得稅容易。　　　採用公司禮券的方式，發行一種物代債券，向民間借用過剩的或節約而來的物產，以供戰用：不能戰用者，則交國營商場出售。此種債券，旣可使擁有存貨，及一般生產者，皆能購買，同時還能直接適應戰爭對於物力的要求。此項債券，償付時仍以物品。在一定時期後，持券人可自由向國營商場，一次或數次，換取其所需之物品；俟其所取之物品價格，巳達票面額後，卽作償淸。為便於推銷起見，亦略給利息，此項債券，能以在市場出售。因其本身，原為一種購買力之化身，故並不足以發生一般之信用危機。　　（註一）F．R．A．Seligman，essaye　in　Taxation第二十三章　　（註二）陳譯馬克思資本論第一編　　（註四）日本銀行調查局出版，戰時財政統計一覽。　　（註五）小林丑三郞，各國財政史第七章　　（註六）A．C．Pigou．Political　economy　ofwar，a　study　in　public　finance，E．L．Bogart，way　costs　and　their　Financing　　（註七）Seligman　前著　　（註八）日本銀行調查局出版前書　　（註九）前書　　（註十）前書　　（註十　）Sellgman　前書　　（註十二）C．C．Plehn　前書　　（註十三）Hugh　Dallon，Principles　ofpublic　Finance　　（註十四）參看尹著非常時期財政論　　（註十五）Secretary　Mcadoor之當時之常年報告　　（註十六）尹著非常時財政論　　（註十七）四月三日申報，見馬氏之談話，朱光澤在東方三十三卷三期發表「中國戰時財政之弱點及其補救」　　（註十八）東方雜誌三十三卷三號，朱光澤有中國戰時財政之弱點及其補救一文　　（註十九）四月十五日申報載，蕭淑宇著：論　　　　非常時期財政政策。　　（註二十）衛撾生著戰時財政，世界書局出版　　（註二十一）經濟季刋六卷一期有中國戰時財政問題一文。　　（註二十二）東方雜誌三十三卷七號。朱　有中國戰時財政之出路一文。　　（註二十三）A．C．Pigou．A　Study　in　publicFinnce，Political　Economy　of　War　　（註二十四）同上　　（註二十五）同上　　（註二十六）Hugh　Dalton．Principles　of　Public　Finance糧食　溥稻堅穩白粳續疲　　（滬南）昨日各幫來源、共到三十餘號、貨共六千餘石、零　兩胃皆屬平淡、天津幫祇辦包胃一千餘包、故市况均疲、厚早粳續但數分至一角、薄稻修幾分、杜洋尖落角許、陰變元平疲、　　（滬北）昨日河下各幫到船二十二三艘、市上白粳去路異常寂寞、市價又小一角左右、早稻平定、薄稻零銷平常、包胃稍動、市形高料緊起近角、中次定勢、各秈亦帶軟勢、陰　貨少、價見定立、白　零拆滯細、價小角許、其餘各貨、價均疲軟、海味　螟蜅鮝新貨卽將上市　　螟蜅即墨魚干、俗稱鳥賊業、產於浙江濱海各地、推羊山·嵊山·岱山·舟山·為最多、次之為泗礁·黃龍·六橫·花鳥·穿山·衢山·沈家門·瀝港·溫州·等處、餘如烟台、及江北一帶亦有生產、名曰北蜅、但產額不逮寗波遠甚、惟品質極佳、肌肉豐厚、個子頭大、且潔白漂亮、非寗波物可與比論也、幫售價亦恒高出一保以上、查二十年前、日本亦有貨來、形狀與北蜅相同、後因國產日多、價又較廉、如被擯絕、每屆初夏、漁戶合夥出洋、從事捕捉、如遇豐收、每年可獲十萬擔之上、若洋生不發、亦有六七萬擔、藉此謀生者、約萬餘人、銷行塲地甚廣、如閩廣川　湘贛等處、均有巨量需要、現下新貨尙未見市、陳貨存額已稀、行家手中、統計不滿千件、市勢故甚穩健、售價北蜅大片五十八元、中片五十叫元、寗波貨提大二十八元、高莊二十三四元、普通二十一二元、後市須看新貨年成之豐歉、而定榮辱也、糖市　本市存糧數量　　四月二十五日止　　國產糧　　洋糧　　共計二十七萬二千餘件、（其中順泰及華

<p>春秋點滴  （方叔俊）　　「使一誠實與勇敢之民族，永居於奴隸地位，乃為不可能之事也。」此希特勒出兵萊茵河演說之語，返顧我國，疆土日蹙，全國民衆何時能踏上勇敢之路？　　一個民族受人欺壓，人為刀爼，我為魚肉，人為主人，我為奴隸，他民族獨立强悍，我民族處於殖民地位，此乃可恥之事，但因恥而發憤圖强極力雪恥，終必能反弱為强，故「恥」之一字是人生事業之鞭策，人生最緊要的是不可無恥。　　「看敵人的劍在你的面部跳舞，其羞辱與死無異，」故一人受屈辱到了無可再忍之時，唯有奮鬥，亦就是和平未到絕望之時，决不放棄為和平而努力。論徐悲鴻  晋豪　　藝術的創造，完全是一個堅苦的工作。作家必須親自去透視「眞實」，才不致於只是懵見一點膚淺的形象，而能深入「眞實」的內裏，並體會其風致。這種「形象」和「風致」，必須借了作家從多時的勞作中所鍜成的成熟而精到的技巧，才能確當地表現出來。但這種表現，又常在有意無意中經過了作家從實生活的戰鬭中所發展的世界觀或意識，予以溶合調正，而充實了作品的生命，也就是提高了它的意義和價値。　　所謂藝術是人格的最高的發展，是必須把作家的眞實的人格，利用了高超的手度，藉助於實際的事態，而後反映出來的。如果假惺惺地裝出英雄氣慨，而偷懶地憑着作家的幻夢，其實是描花樣地使着他的「魄力」，那他所趕置出來的，只是虛偽得可笑的東西，我們姑不論他自命為「新」，為「古，」却不能承認它是藝術。　　悲鴻先生是當現代中國，起初的衰亂，形成他的逃避的幻境；後來的綿弱，萌發他的豪俠的英氣；今日的危亡，摧動他的亢壯的悲情。簫聲·風辰·等等，是他的第一期的作品；風塵三俠·駿馬等等，是他的第二期的作品；田橫五百士·獅吼·鷄鳴·秋隼等等，是他的第三期的作品。　　所謂「寫意」，果然大多是憑着作家的想像，然而却須根據事實。悲鴻先生出生於貧苦之家，遊歷於歐美各國，涉足於型物之羣，他的感受是痛切的，他的認識是深刻的，他的審視是現實的。　　是有這樣的熱忱，細緻而又忠誠的態度的悲鴻先生，而為以營業為事的藝界所忌刻，在我們却認為不足畏懼。正由於他的堅忍地與塗沒了本色的藝壇上的「花臉」相鬥爭，而能更顯著地襯託出他的品格來。　　在羣衆中找取典型人物，在事物中研究構造形態，並且一直步地踏淮了現實生活，是悲鴻趨向的態度。誠摯切實地抽取各種形象的眞髓，而顯示他一再繼續發展的觀照，新的手法和內容的表現，這斷乎不是一般浮滑膚淺的藝士在名士要人中攏絡和養成了一些缺欠「實力」的門徒的吹噓所能捧得出來的。　　今後世界局面的展現，將使悲鴻先生在藝術的創造上轉上了一個更高的階段，這並非不可能的。憎愛與冷熱  曼子　　我見明星半月刋四卷六期裏有這麼一首詩：『桃花紅與李花白，各占人間一半春，憎愛何須分冷熱，銀屛消息問蘭因。』心想所謂「蘭因，」一定在「銀屛」上有一個解答的，便在前天去看「桃李爭豔」的影片，為了時間很晏，竟一夜沒有好睡，但是看了以後，覺得有了一些啟示了，總算得可償失。　　這一齣戲裏，描寫兩種女子的戀愛心理，一種是認愛情為自然的，不肯熱烈地表示出來，連「我愛你」的口頭禪，也不願意說，對象有變動時，並不着急，不和情敵競爭，失敗也任憑着。但是伊的情深一往，是到底可以看得出的。一種是認愛情為必須奪取的，稍縱卽逝，絕對不可放鬆的，情敵在前，不惜犧牲一切，用全力奔赴，所以結果是勝利居多。　　自從男女社交公開以後，情愛的糾紛便日形繁複，歸納起來，實在只有冷熟兩種。而一般靑年，總是愛熱而憎冷的。不過熱的未必永久是熱的，倘然受了冷空氣的襲擊，就得大起變化，這時的反動，或者竟冷得不可耐，試照因熱愛而結為夫婦終於畔離的有多少？至於冷的，不過是外形而已，伊的內在，也未必不熱。古人說：『君子之交淡如水。』水倒是始終如一的。　　葉秋心和顧蘭君代表冷熱兩種女子，在表演上都是恰到好處。並且冷的不像祁寒，熱的不像溽暑，使人難受。中間有一種「正義感，」在左之右之，所以有許多對話，是可以使觀衆的心坎裏起强烈的反應，尤其是情塲裏的過來人。　　不過這是我的主觀意見，不知道編劇和導演的意識是吾如此？　　許多襯託，也是不蔓不支，可說主賓都能呼應，是證現在的影人，能够知道自己的責任了。　　音樂會塲面的富麗堂皇，丁家山的幽蒨葱籠，和搶護潰堤的緊張，在人工的布畫也相當努力了。特寫京滬文藝界聯歡瑣紀  寄萍　　中國文藝社春季旅行團由京來滬，海上文藝界熱烈歡迎，這不僅是聯絡京滬兩地文藝界的感情，而且震撼了沉悶的中國文壇，如斯盛會，不可以無記。該團諸君，除參觀游覽之外，有過四决大集會，我曾參列三次，所見所聞，不勝縷紀，此文不過摭述一二而已。　　文藝界同人在靑年會聯合招待之後，市長吳鐵城於二十三日歡宴該團全體，並邀文藝界作陪，先在市府圖書室聚談，這裏有大學敎授，著作家，出版家，藝術家，新聞記者，都百餘人，濟濟多士，在這「自由談座」，笑語雜沓，使你辨不出是什麽音調來。一時開宴，酒數巡後，市長致詞，講起古今文藝運動，中間並穿插一段故事：「……昔廣東某留學生回來，說西洋文明這也好，那也好，中國一切都是壞的。而守舊的父親，聽得大怒，賞兩大耳光，他還說父親也是西洋的好。……」引起闔座大笑。文藝界由王雲五氏代表演說，他自比黃包車夫，著作家是顧主，深感中國出版界遭遇的苦痛，希望增加少壯的顧主，不願意多拉衰老的弱者，意思是說翻印古書，不及多出新書來得有勁，此老一篇話，非常痛快，眞值得佩服。其次謝壽康，在旭初，方治諸氏，都有警闢的說辭。　　第三次是上海十四文化團體公宴於大東酒樓，設中菜四十席，情形更比市府熱烈，黎照實氏代表致歡迎詞，一大篇廣東官話，徐悲鴻是響亮豪放的宜興口音，徐仲年十足的無錫調；還有汪旭初的吳儂軟語；各有道理。有人請歐陽予倩淸唱，全體鼓掌，而予倩固辭，大為掃興。席間有一位陳丕士，是陳友仁的長公子，黑臉壯漢，滿口洋話，頗為衆人注目。黃警頑奔走招待，聲如半啞，靑布袍弄得很髒。那次吃的是改良中菜，四冷盆，六道菜，外加便飯，倒很够飽，其實多吃也沒有味道。　　最後一次，該團答謝上海文藝界，假座滄洲飯店的草坪，這一次露天茶會，眞够興奮。原來時令尙早，氣溫太低，又當紅日西墜，寒風瑟瑟，到會的百餘來賓都說「吃不消」。識相的人，簽名坐席之後，狼呑虎嚥的把茶點往肚裏送，吃完了一溜烟的走了。還有幾位挨冷的朋友，高談闊論，直到烏黑才散。這時園中忽然幾聲怪叫，扭成一團的好像蒙古人摔角，驚得許多人坐而立，起而觀，原來謝壽康李大超與大華烈士（簡又文）起了一陣三角鬥爭，本是鬧得玩的，所以大家鼓掌笑起來了。我在此認識了一位朝報婦女週刋編者沈紫曼女士，談起本行話來，覺得婦刋取材眞困難，文義的深淺，性質的軟硬，都不易支配，而讀者不諒，往往加以苛責，眞是天曉得！　　昨晨該團赴杭游覽去了，盼望諸君能將此行所得，公諸大衆，並把文藝社擴大組織，使全國文人，站在統一的旗幟之下，努力於文藝救國的運動。換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第一回　品茗昨淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝　艷影花巷流芳　　你是沒有成家的人，將來耗費更大呢。趁着現在還可以省錢的時候，就先節省起來，到了將來和你娶親的時候，把這筆節省出來的錢和你辦喜事，也免得拉虧空。我說節省，也並不是指着用下人這一件事上說。凡事都要省儉一點了。這位老太，是不惜帶了一副慈祥的面色，對這位少年從容的說着。他說着這話時，坐在一張舊的木圍椅上，兩手互按在懷裏，向這位少年望着。他是覺得他的話，也許是兒子不能了解的，這樣殷切的望着兒子，是表示着自己這一番打算，也許有不對的，所以望了兒子，看他是怎麽樣子的答復。這少年將燈放在棹子裏邊，將燈頭更轉得大些，也看看母親的顏色。他心裏也是在那裏自忖着。母親之說起這一番話，不是　然的，必定怕是自己不能諒解，才這樣從容婉轉的說出來，慈母的用心，那是很苦的。於是在椅子下面，抽出來便鞋，坐下來帶換着鞋子，帶說着話，很不經意的樣子，笑答道：在我這樣的境况裏能够維持生活，也許是幸事，果然多兩個錢的話，第一就是讓你老人家省點心，少受點累，找一個用人，來替代你老的事務。因為你老苦巴苦掙把我等了這樣大，把我養得成人了，我不應當再累母親了。除此之外，再有點富餘的錢呢，那就應當去買兩本書看。我覺得出來作事太早了，沒有了讀書的機會。現在雖然在學堂裏敎幾點鐘書，向上海報館裏投投稿，可以餬口。但是不能一輩子都這樣餬口而已。假使自巳還想有些進步的話，那是非增進學問不可。進學堂讀書不行了，那只有自修。所以現在我只想把這兩件事做到，其餘的事，我全沒有那種希望。年輕的人，談到婚事，總有點含羞答答的，雖然母子之間，談着眞心話，他也不好意思直率的說出來。可是這位慈母，明白他的意思了，笑道：那是孩子話！作母親的人，不是把你讀出書來，就算了事的，總得把這家治得像個家。旣是家裏要成個樣子，不能我們家永遠是這兩個孤兒寡母。譬如說罷，你若是有什麽事出門去了，家裹就剩下我一個人，我慢慢的走上老人家這條路了，這讓我太寂寞。你父親去逝的時候，我在他靈位前起過誓的。一定耐窮守節，把你撫養成人，傳宗接後。（一三）小春秋週刋人生的眞諦  （康僧）　　　　什麽是人生的眞諦？第一種人說是混混噩噩，過一天算一天，做一日和尙撞一日鐘。第二種人說，我行我素，對得住天地，對得住良心就是了；第三種人說，人生來世一次，應該儘量的來享受快樂，做一世快快活活的人，那麽總算不虛此生。然而，我却以為人生的眞諦，簡單的說一句，只有一個「幹」字，你得堅强你的意志，來努力的往前挺進，從「幹」的中間，你方才可以得到人生眞正的樂趣，從「幹」的中間，你亦可以去體味着世間辛酸苦惱的一切，這就是人生的眞諦。美人肝  顯元　　汪精衛先生，不但是當代的政治巨頭，而尤擅詩文，風致洒然，在靑年的時候，有美男子之目。　　汪先生在首都時，愛吃馬回回肆的「美人肝」。有一次設宴請蔣先生，特設此品，一座稱賞。馬回回肆的老板，對熟悉的顧客，常常從懷中掏出一張紙條，「召馬興祥肆速製美人肝，送汪公館」。書法挺秀，確出在之親筆。此可與蘇州木凟石家飯店于髯稱賞的　肺湯，輝映一時也。說豆腐  承昭　　豆腐在古時叫菽乳，相傳是淮南王劉安所發明，但也不能得詳細的證明。父相傳朱熹不吃豆腐，因為豆腐的原料水和豆混雜後，經過一天，往往為溢於原秤的數目，朱熹細心硏究其理，但始終得不到結果，所以不吃了。現在歐美頗有學者硏究豆腐，因豆腐實是世上最補身體的食物。　　「賣　番薯者」　他的孩子説拾　　　　　　陳眉公之別墅  亞厂　　明陳繼儒眉公，居松江東佘山，有山中宰相之譽，世多知之。近讀章有謨景船齋雜記，（松江沈瘦狂先生藏有抄本）曰：「曾王父鹿苑公，於東佘山築白石山房，後為陳眉公居，今人但知眉公有北別墅，不知別墅之出於章氏也。」迺知眉公別墅，非自營築。此節殊未見諸其他載籍，錄之，為關心掌故者告焉。中國人比外國人大一歲  紫英　　我說：「中國人比外國人大一歲，」你覺得奇怪麽？　　「這話怎麽講呢」？你一定要問。　　且聽我說：　　原來中外歲數的算法，各有不同：我們中國人一生下來那年就是一歲；外國人却要滿了一年才算一歲，比方吧：中國的小三子是在民國二十三年十二月三十一日出生的，隔了一天，民國二十四年一月一日小三子已經兩歲了。可是外國的保羅是在一九三四年十二月三十一日出生的，却要到了一九三五年十二月三十一日才是一歲，那麽，他們雖然是同年同月同日生，可是却差了一歲，—中國人佔了大一歲的便宜。　　不過在科學上的計算，却是要以實足年齡為準的。相對論  （權）　　當你和你底美麗的戀人同坐兩小時，你以為只不過是兩分鐘；但當你坐在一個熱的火爐上兩分鐘時，你便覺得已經是兩小時了。—這便是相對論」　　愛因斯坦的學生說</p>

<p>康健之路消化不良  陳少華　　凡患胃加答兒症，皆有消化不良。有由於胃酸過或過少而起者，有因於胃擴張，胃痙攣（即心氣痛）者。其尤異者：則為神經性消化不良，患者食慾恒隨精神之愉快與否為轉移，例如喜則食量大增，憂則食减胸悶是也，　　余臨床實騐，確證德國「强胃精」一藥，對於一切消化不良，最有卓效。凡胃症吐酸泛噁，噯氣嘈雜，食後作脹，腹痛隱隱，或大便閉結，或瀉洩，或便　，此藥皆著奇騐，因藥內含有ABD三種最珍貴之生活素，能治脚氣萎弱症，而有補血補腦，强壯益神之殊功。性質王道，若能連服數瓶，可使面色紅嫩，百病不侵。淋病之唯一有效處置　　淋病之療法，自昔視為一大難題，其故則由淋菌潛伏於體內，難以根本殲減，若投以藥力稍强烈之製劑，菌毒未除，腸胃反先受碍，即使消化器不蒙損害，而終不免於使腎臟大受刺激，結果小便滯澀，釀成尿中毒，危險莫甚，然若藥力稍鈍，又無補於事，此所以治淋最難也，且欲根除淋菌，亦非單純『透膜段菌』所克奏效，故醫家苦之。惟淋菌對免疫體免疫法Immunkoper　gegen　Gonokokken，Immunisierung自近世發現以來，已成為治淋學上之鐵則，於是德國「克淋儂」即根據此原理創製而告成功！服此藥後，能促進體內自働性及他働性之免疫，而使淋菌悉數撲滅，以歸一掃而除，永遠根治，無再發之虞。不論急性慢性淋濁，以及攝護睪丸關節炎與其他合併症，得此即可淋消濁止，炎症迅愈，Dembska氏曾作實騐，計男女患者服此迅獲根治者，竟達百分之九十七以上，其治績實屬驚人，是以此藥在歐美各國久已風行，蓋以其藥性和平，毫無刺激也。惟購服時，務須認明眞正「克淋儂」三字，庶不致誤服。白帶之累  金月仁　　婦女最所受累之病，厥為白帶，婦女十九皆有此病，每以其平常與隱患而忽之，豈知往往因此帶病，而釀巨患者，如白帶最易招外來細菌，故白帶久不愈者，其膣道多被菌毒所刺戟，而發炎糜爛。遂引起月經困難，久婚不姙之原因。余對此等病狀，多令外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，作為坐藥。如因體虛而患白帶者，與「補女容」同時服用。因丈夫傳染淋毒而患白帶者，與「克淋儂」同時服用。均能於三四星期左右完全治愈。愈後照常生育，是「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，實治白帶藥中最具權威之藥品也。凡有白帶之累之婦女，皆可自療，毫無流弊。戴德醫師內分泌實騐報告兩性發育之障碍　　兩性發育，苟無先天發育不全之原因，則每個人皆有健全發育之天賦，然許多靑年，多於發育時代，濫施手淫，或早婚與房事過度，均能使正在發育中之靑春腺，受傷萎縮，故男子有身體矮小，生殖器發育不全，陰莖勃起力不充分，女性則卵巢機能减弱，月經遲至，白帶涓流，乳房平坦，身體消瘦或癡肥。其兩性相同之症狀，則有失眠，頻發艷夢，頭痛目眩，腰膝酸痛，精神恍惚，作事無恒，記憶力薄弱等，凡靑春腺發育不全者，皆為不孕之主因。　　德國梅倫博士，殫畢生之心血，發明男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，二藥係提取靑春旺盛期之雌雄用兩性動物，如猩猩海狗獅虎等睪丸及卵巢之荷　　，分別用科學方法製成。服此藥後，於三四星期後，即能洽愈發育障碍。余曾用「補體康」洽愈陳姓病人。陳君於發育期即被手淫所害，致下體發育不全，遺精早洩，腎萎，失眠頭昏。婚後夫婦感情冷淡，歷服諸藥，未奏功效。余乃囑其購服「補體康」，詎服後未及四星期，發育即歸正常，遺精等患，均得全愈。嗣陳君又以其外戚周女士，苦患月經不調，乳房發平小，如未發育者然，乃亦介紹其服「補女容」，經服一月，脂肪漸加，乳房高聳，月經按期而至，約未年餘，欣舉一雄。皆莫不讚賞「補體康」及「補女容」二藥功效之卓特云。多年胃病根瘳  黎福民　　患者范思源君，年卅二。病原—暴飲暴食，損傷胃機。病狀—見食生厭，每飯平均不足一碗。胃部膨脹，時而陣痛，時而作嘔，時而泛酸，致營養不良，身體日陷孱弱。服藥殆遍，迄未根治，寖至夜間失眠，眩昏耳鳴，憔悴不堪。始來余處求治。治療—余知其病源所在，即對症發藥，投服德國「强胃精」約四星期，各症頓失，食時津津有味，且精神日增，面紅肌盛，愉快無比云。德國淋病特效藥　克淋儂實騐寫眞  盛在强　　（一）急性淋獲愈　　患者裘叔良君。年廿三歲，前為酒後，涉足平康，歸即感染淋病，尿道灼熱刺痛，恒泌出茶綠色分泌物，內有膿血球甚多，龜頭腫大，尿意頻數，其疼痛散放於會陰肛門諸部。夜間更起疼痛性之射精。迭經治療，均未得效。後由張君介紹余處治療。此急性淋也。須用消炎殺菌之內服藥，以遏止病勢，即投以德國治淋聖藥「克淋儂」。以消炎殺菌，通利小便，使菌毒從內排除，未二星期痛止炎消小便暢利，續服一星期，始完全治愈。旋裘君曾作長途旅行，舟車勞頓，未嘗復發云。　　（二）傳染妻室　　患者史維誠君，年廿八歲。已婚。已患淋病五年，時有溷濁之白物流出。大便努責時亦然。殊以為苦，前來余處診療。斷為慢性攝護腺炎，且有成漏之趨勢，其泌出之白物，蓋即攝護腺液也，除令安靜並為之行按摩後，即囑內服「克淋儂」，以殺菌而收歛病灶。治療五星期而愈。其夫人亦被史君所染，而成淋毒性白帶，經余指用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥。內服「克淋儂」，內外兼治，亦於四星期而全將白帶掃除云。余自用此內外兼治法，治愈夫妻淋病者，已逾數千人矣。問病信箱　　本刋特約專家，分別解答肺病，胃病，婦女病，花柳病，性病等。請附足回信郵票，寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥社。　　腎萎頭昏　　曾叔明君問：鄙人幼失怙恃，長成於傭僕之手，在十五歲時，即知自凟，致發育不全，婚後更無樂趣遺精，腎萎，頭昏眼花，屢次服藥，均未有效，未　何　可　。又內子亦有月經落後，少腹作痛，白帶下諸症，亦乞介紹良醫，俾余夫婦，早日脫苦海。　　（答）貴恙為性神經衰弱，內分泌不足，可服「補體康」自有良效。至尊夫人之月經病可服「補女容」，以調整月經，一方用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，則白帶病自愈。　　睪丸作痛　　王雅雲君問：敝人前患淋病，服藥醫治，皆無功效。近來睪丸隱隱作痛，小便短少，且不易排泄，夜間且有遺精，擬欲請貴刋介紹有效之良藥或名醫，千祈勿吝指示！　　（答）尊恙已成睪丸炎。可服「克淋儂」，最好請姚菊巖醫師行電氣及抗淋血淸治療，當能於短期內治愈之。遺精可服「補體康」。　　咳嗽食减　　怡大君問：敝人年十九歲，因肺病作悶，咳嗽飲食减少。請問有何良藥以救我？　　（答）肺病可服「補肺拿雨」，又同服「强胃精」以振胃慾，則肺病更易治愈。　　陰道剌痛　　黎女士問：敝人素有月經不調，白帶病之症，近因丈夫傳染淋病，致白帶下更多，陰道時覺刺痛，請問有無調經止帶之藥？　　（答）可服「補女容」以調其月經，「克淋儂」以殺菌除淋，更外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，如此內外兼顧，則厥疾自愈。鄧源和醫師肺病臨床實騐錄　　診所寗波路四川路口　診時下午四時至六時　　癆欬腎虧生機復萌　　患者梅世馨君，年廿九，學界。病原—早歲手淫，身體瘦弱。病狀—咳嗽多痰，午後體溫增高，胸脇隱痛，痰唾白膩，有時夾血，四肢乏力，腰痠膝楚，精神倦怠，夜間失眠，盜汗遺精，胃呆便秘，體重益减。延宕多載，愈陷愈烈，嗣投余處求治。診療—X光檢查，癆症殊烈。聽診肺有水泡音，病正進行。非普通療法所能愈，即為施以注射，並告以自宅療養法。一方囑服德國肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，根除癆咳，而愈血痰，並令同時服德國「補體康」安補神經，以治腎虧失眠，連服三盒，食增咳止，血痰亦失，投枕即得酣睡，卽自行安心進服前藥月許，精神大增，體重增加三十磅，肌肉充盈，腎部有力云。　　久咳內傷迅復壯健　　患者李玉珍女士，年廿四，藝術界。病原—不善攝生，每患感胃。病狀—鼻塞多涕，欬嗆頻發，痰色稠黃，不易喀出，喉癢聲嘶，經年莫愈，迭藥無效，體漸　羸，月經不調，食慾倒退，失眠心悸，顏面潮紅。去春始來余處求治。診療—經用科學方法檢查，斷為肺尖加答兒，行將轉為癆瘵。卽施以對症療法，並囑內服「補肺拿爾」則頑痰久咳均除，癆症可免，同時令服德國「補女容」治其體虛失眠，而調　經期。果未四盒，諸恙霍然，恐防再發，卽連服旬餘，昨接其來字，詎謂愈後迄已年餘，身體壯健，精神煥發，面色紅潤，肌膚美澤云。姚菊巖醫師淋病臨床報告　　診所：四川路寗波路轉角。　診時：上午十時至下午六時。　　白濁因何纏綿不已　　性病中之纏綿難愈者，莫淋病若。原來淋病之治愈，其初並不甚難，祇因患者，缺少常識，其初起多諱疾忌醫，或治療而不得其法，遂成慢性，且因此而其妻子亦被傳染。使白帶增多。故一方雖獲治騐，然未幾因房事接觸關係，治愈者依然再度傳染。如此往復傳染，淋病勢無治愈之日矣。　　然以予經騐，以夫婦雙方同時醫治，往往獲同時根治之效，有鍾炎海君，罹染淋病多年，其夫人旋亦患白帶，嗣鍾君雖治愈數次，但不久復發，夫婦二人殊以為苦，嗣在大東書局購到余之「性病全書」，始來余處治療。經余診察，知已轉成全身傳染之關節炎，每一屈伸，痛楚甚烈。凡大關節處皆紅腫作痛。遂行抗淋血淸及電氣療法，以扑滅廣泛之淋菌，並囑購服德國「克淋儂」，以鎭痛除淋，而促炎症之消散。詎鍾君誤購偽藥，服後反見炎症增劇，莖痛如裂，復來余所，余乃嚴囑認明眞正「克淋儂」三字，始可收卓效。果服月餘後炎消腫退痛止，再用血淸檢查，全無淋毒反應。乃斷其根治，其夫人之白帶，亦經外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以制止分泌液而除白帶，復內服「克淋儂」，以殺淋菌，計四星期而全治。鍾君伉儷。自經余治愈後，纏綿不愈之淋病，從未再發云。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言猶回民族互仇  周戈　　在這全世界戰雲密佈，帝國主義磨拳擦掌，正想再來一次大屠殺的時候，我們不久之前所聽到的各地弱小民族（例如叙利亞的民族革命解放運動的稍得成功）的解放運動，一時好像非常有生氣似地，可是就在這之間，近幾日來報紙上揭露出巴力斯坦「猶回民族互仇」的消息，不得不使我們有點愕然了　　巴力斯坦臨地中海東岸的南部，北界叙利亞，南抵埃及的西奈半島，內部和克拉克毘連。面積約二萬三千萬公里。歐戰前是屬於土爾共，戰後才歸英國代管。是猶太人的故鄉，也是耶回猶三敎的聖地。住民約一百零四萬，以信回敎的阿刺伯人佔多數，猶太人多漂留海外，留居故鄉的只佔當地人口的十分之二。近年來常受阿刺伯人的嫉視，因此雙方時常發生鬥殺的事情。而這次事件的起因據報載是「因為先有一猶太人被殺，所以猶太人遂殺阿刺伯人兩人以示報復」。就這樣，鬥殺的消息在日報上連續不斷地刋出在我們的眼前了。　　帝國主義壓迫弱小民族，除了其武力經濟文化等武器外，剩下的就是利用其宗敎信仰等的不同，來使同是受壓迫的人發生鬥殺的事情，帝國主義就在這里可以從中取利，可是這種手段，在進步的弱小民族中，已洞察其詐計，而再也不受其欺騙了，可是在落後的民族中，我們是還能看到這一種互相鬥殺，互相把自己的「元氣」消殺的事情，這不是可為之一歎乎？　　不過巴力斯坦的勞苦猶太羣衆和阿刺伯羣衆，似乎也覺醒在他們之間根本沒有什麽「仇恨」的，因此曾經有「阿刺伯·猶太的國家」的建立的運動發生。在這全世界戰雲密佈所謂第二次世界大戰就將蒞臨的現在，凡是被壓迫的弱小民族都不應該互相「仇恨」，反之，應該互相「聯合」，求到自己的民族眞正能够獨立自由平等於世界之上。這「猶回民族互仇」，我們相信不久會在阿刺伯猶太勞苦羣衆中起着一種反作用的。母與子  胡慰雄　　淸明時節，還沒有到農忙的時候，田里的泥堆翻鬆了，田塲上一片太陽，嫩風吹上身來呌人有點疲倦；但是孩子們是最高興的時候。一個冬天因為沒有皮的棉的穿，把小身體藏在茅屋里，（或許躱在破棉絮里）活生生地剝奪了他們頑皮的本性，現在却像一張拉足了的彈弓一樣，踝着小腿在田野上野狗似的亂跑了。有的把去年用棉紙竹片自造的風箏帶出來，學着大人的樣，由同伴把這紙糊的東西在高頂上向天一送，底下拉着繩的馬上向相反的方向奔：但是他們從母親那里要來的蔴繩實在短得可憐，風箏被牽制着不能自由地飛上天去，跑過半條田岸，一翻身滾下地來。這情形是其他的孩子們所希望着的，於是一陣哄笑。那個跑的孩子似乎不服氣，要求他的同伴再帮一次忙，但是結果是那風箏受到了七孔八穿的創傷，笑聲駡聲却充滿了田野。　　在那羣孩子中時常分成數派，譬如就是放風箏，一方希望倒下來，一方努力想放上天去，為了這點事爭鬥，打架是並不希奇的，但是過後又是你好我好大家都好了；祗是例外的根福嫂家的小福兒。　　根福嫂在這里好像也是孤獨的，男入當兵去了，三年來沒有音訊。種着的幾畝田慢慢地改了姓，但是兩張嘴巴要吃下去的，就偸偸摸摸搭上了漢子。鄉下最見不得人的是偸漢子，最引人興趣的新聞也是偸漢子，這種被認為不乾凈的事體很快地傳遍了全村。小福兒，這個可憐的孩子，在那些大人們惡狠狠地吩咐自己的兒子，「懂得嗎？不許同那野種玩！」的命令下，他總是獨自躱在塲角落里貪婪地看着他們玩耍，小福兒是多麽羨慕着他的同伴啊！　　放風箏的遊戲結束後，一個最大的孩子就凑着每個孩子的耳朶提出一件什麽事，彷彿軍師似的要大家守着秘密，雖然孩子們終究笑了起來。那個大孩子就走到塲角里拉着小福兒的手，和氣地說：「我們大家來玩罷。」從袋里掏出一包糖來，分着小福兒吃。小福兒顯得受寵若驚的樣子，由那大孩子拉着他的手一步一挨地走到大家玩耍的地方。那些孩子們就圍着他，做「拍大麥」「喊口令」各種遊戲，最後那孩子問他：「昨天晚上你爸回家來了？」　　「不，」小福兒搖搖頭「是前村的阿根伯伯。」　　「不是和你媽做一頭睡嗎？」　　小福兒知道這是不乾掙的事，低下頭，看着自己的手掌，沒有回答。但是大孩子又從袋里拿出一包糖來推到小福兒手里：「是不是？明天再有好吃的東西。」　　看着那包糖，小福兒羞澀地點點頭。　　那些孩子們見了小福兒的表示，馬上聚合地喊起來：「天主瑪琍亞，一個伲子兩個爺」（鄉下的一種歌謠，諷刺私生子的。）大孩子接着問了句「啥人？」又是聚合的回答：「小福兒！」　　這樣一遍二遍的繼續着，根福嫂在屋子里聽見了幾乎發狂一樣追出來拉了小福兒回家，一邊鎖上門，隨手拖着一根曬棒預備打小福兒的時候，她見兒子眼腔里聚滿着眼淚跪到在地上，看着兒子的臉，她想着出門了三年的丈夫，並且眼前馬上浮上了丈夫的影子，她心里像鐵針刺着，把小福兒抱到懷里，「苦命的孩子」她也放聲大哭了。　　那些孩子們故意在根福嫂門外唱着那歌謠，一遍二遍地……晨  時玳　　滿天星斗還閃着晶光，報曉的公鷄，就高聲尖嗓的咯咯啞啞呌起來。聲浪冲破了大地的靜寂的網膜，村莊從沉寂中驚醒了。福林媳婦在睡夢朦朧中彷彿聽見街門吱呀一聲開了，她嚇得心卜卜跳，以為又是賊來啦！去年賊偸了驢，婆母埋怨她不留心門戶，用錐子扎她，三天不給她東西吃！她先喀嗽一聲，接着就伸手去摸福林，手落了空，這才明白是男人出去了，但她還不放心的側着耳朶聽一會兒，沒有什麽動靜，便又睡下。　　福林媳婦剛剛睡過去，婆母就在東房里炕上扯着嗓子罵起來：　　「騷胯子！黑心眼子的東西！你成天成夜的挑唆男人，惹我生氣，想要了我這條老命！妄想，要折磨死我等下一輩子吧！你夜叉精！有我喘氣活着你想當家難上難！」　　孩子給駡聲驚哭，福林媳婦趕快把奶頭塞進孩子嘴里。自己一聲也不言語，這駡她聽慣了，永遠她沒有回聲，祇把悶氣和委屈裝在肚子里。　　「夜叉精！還不滾起來推磨！」　　福林媳婦也顧不得孩子哭，就下炕去推磨。</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>春樹上的月光移到果樹園上了。欄里等着拌草的驢子，呌過一陳之後就踢起槽腿來。慢慢的街上有了起早拾糞的人的喀嗽聲，瘦狗機警的尖着耳朶，吠着　到街門口，好像是干涉走路人。這當兒福林媳婦放下磨棍去給牲口添草。孩子在炕上不住氣的哭，她幾次想去抱他，喂他一會兒奶，可是她怕婆母罵她。拾起磨棍再推。　　「沒心肝的東西！孩子哭死了你也不管！」　　她立刻丟了磨棍就去抱孩子，用袖子給孩子擦眼淚和鼻涕，自己的淚水也不知不覺的滴到孩子身上。沒歇兒工夫婆母又罵：　　「奶孩子也得半天嗎？天生的懶骨頭！」　　孩子的小手抓住她的褂子裾，不斷的「媽媽」的哭呌着，她放不下孩子，只好一隻手抱着孩子，一隻手扶着磨棍，呼呼的推，呼呼的推。汗從臉上流到嘴裏，流到孩子頭上。　　圈里的老母猪噢噢的呌着要食吃，恰巧福林媳磨也推完了。她把睡着了的孩子輕輕的放到炕上，嘴里低聲的哼着，手在孩子身上拍着，一會兒她就到外面喂猪。鄰家的年老的勞傷病患者，一連串的喀嗽聲飄過來。她看看天色發白就進屋吹滅燈，屋子還是黑通通的；為着避免婆母的責罵，她常常在黑暗中做活，此刻她坐在鍋臺上，團箱（註）擱在鍋上，不停籮着包米麵子。　　婆母似乎罵人罵得疲倦了，又睡着啦。福林媳婦一籮一籮的搖着，籮圈底擦着籮麵架篤篤的響，麵子在團箱里不斷增長。腰，腿，胳膊，都酸痛得難忍，她停一下又搖，停一下又搖。最後她的胳膊實在沒力氣再搖了，剛停住籮，房里婆母喀嗽了，她趕急咬着牙免强的再搖，那可恨的籮！　　黑夜偷偷的離開了村莊，莊稼人聽到山中的寺鐘敲起，便開始動身到田里去。　　福林媳婦掏過灶洞里的草灰便拾掇鍋灶。婆母也下炕來，一見媳婦的面，臉上立刻就出怒色，她那老臉上的每根絲紋都足以使媳婦畏懼！她到水缸去舀水洗臉，不料水瓢落了空，於是氣吼吼的罵：　　「你眼珠子瞎！缸里沒水　你看不見！」　　媳婦見婆母就像耗子見了貓，她趕急趕急担起水桶去挑水。她出了門還聽婆母在後面罵。　　晨曦混雜着炊烟，雲霧似的罩籠着楊柳樹，罩籮着莊園……東方的太陽露紅了。　　註：團箱是用白細柳條結織的籮麵用具，圓形，敞口直徑的三尺左右。在塘沽的小旅舍中（續）  孟華　　「先生，今晚可要呌一位姑娘陪你玩玩？」第三天的晚上，那個年靑的夥計，似乎猜透了我的心情，這樣問我。　　「出門人應當開心開心，哈哈，他看見我不回答，就笑着說下去。「每個到過搪沽的，入都曉得，這里有三多，海貨多，臭虫多，窰孟多。先生，你說，塘沽是不是……」　　然而我終於把他打發開去。但當時我心里却矛盾得很厲害，我想要是有一個女人在這冷淸淸的夜里，陪着我，卽使不說一句話，大家默默而坐，不也愉快得多？如果她也是一個飄零在外處的無家的人，那麼大家又不是可以共消這難堪的寂寞麼？　　門外有人在打門了，是敲得那樣輕微。　　「進來，「我以為是帳房來要帳的。聚然門開了，是一個女人，頭兒低低地，用眼角斜睨着我。　　「先生，」她頓了頓。「先生，唱一隻曲吧？」牛鼻子  黄堯　　她抬長頭來，用朦朧的眼邑打量着我。是一個中等身村的人，額前留着稀疎的劉海。她薄薄的嘴唇動了動，可是沒說出話來。舉動顯出侷促同羞澀。　　「請坐！我心里打算這樣說，然而我却呆呆地望着她，說不出半句話氣。她體會了我眼睛所說的話，帶上門走近我身邊來，可是我竟閃開她。突然，我一下意識地這樣對她說：「不……」下面的一話只用搖頭來說明。她睜了睜，接着就像幽靈一樣的掠出門去。　　我立刻關了房門，扭滅了燈，躱在被窩過放縱地哭起來。難以形容的寂寞把我踩里它的脚下，儘量蹂躪着了。　（完）愛娜  尤其　　有一椿控不出來的憂怨，深悶在愛娜的心頭。　　她不能說什麽，也不敢向任何一個人提起，她淸楚的知道那些，卽使向旁人提起，也是不會有用的。當子夜到來的時候，伙伴們像受了傷的死屍，無聲息的睡去，整個的空間，被寂寞統領着，街頭的燈光，透過了玻璃窗射到奶油色的墻板上，混沌的看得出掛鈎上的長毛巾，自己的大衣，和一條彩色絨綫織就的花圍巾，除此以外，那只有不停的鐘音了。　　她私忖着姐姐的病症，想到她病苦的臉和呻吟的調子。哥哥呢，眞的那負擔是够他受的了，一切的重量都壓在他的肩上，力氣，是被靈活的機器吞沒了，然而，為了生活，他不敢有一點鬆懈，又那里有什麼餘錢能替姐姐治病呢？　　挨到天明，窗外在落着細雨，怱忽地，她趕回家里去。哥哥是老早的起來了，用着悲　的眼神望着她，連嘆了幾口氣，淚水滴到她姐姐的面頰上，再浸潤到那破敗的被頭里，跟着，他的頭低了下去。　　她抱着姐姐的頭，哭了，蒸發的熱氣從姐姐的額角上燙進了她的心窩，想起姐姐愛護的親情，她眞想把自己來毀滅替代姐姐的病症。　　——我看還是去看看吧？　　——那里有錢呢！　　聽着前樓的鐘聲敲到了六下，哥哥提着飯盒子慌忙的出去了。　　鐘點，不肯寬容的滑過去，樓底下，正有一股悶人的油膩衝上來，她意識到這該是午飯的時刻了，為了想抓獲着本日的顧客，奔上了回歸的路。她想—　　——如果我有了錢，什麼事都不成問題的，然而錢？怎樣的去取得呢，在這被泥污封湧的社會里？沒羽的箭穿過了她的心，流着股股的血。（未完）播音特別節目　　民衆歌詠會　　交通（一三〇〇）下午六時半至七時　　義勇軍進行曲（全體）自强歌（全體）美哉中華（全體）國旗歌（全體）蘇武（全體）救中國（全體）打長江（全體）運動會歌（全體）自衛歌（全體）打回老家去（全體）彈詞　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠鳳　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時二刻　　開篇「三笑搶美」　　夏官公子性强梁，好色貪花意氣在，幼年也把詩書讀，採芹香身已列膠庠，可惜行為輕薄甚，時時强搶美紅妝，財又多，勢又强，彷彿山君孰敢當，氣燄薰大王老虎，惡聲名傳遍滿城廂，今宵出外花燈看，一衆佳人盡覺慌，有的，關繡戶，有的，閉蘭房，不抬身惟有一周郎，豪奴一見禀天寳，搶歸府第有何妨，狐假虎戚眞可笑，不提防，纖手連連打耳光，他們是，洋洋得意如飛去，好一個，作怪的枝山假著忙，口稱尋美鬧非常，忽地悲啼忽地笑，裝瘋一路繞街坊，十分快活千分喜，大財餉一注可叨光，我雖無，濟顚僧佛法無邊廣，也能够，伏虎把虎來降，且待王家邀請我，相機行事莫忽忙，笑王熊白白的喜如狂。　　徐文璧開篇　　航業（一一八〇）十一時一刻至十二時　　開篇「驚變」　　天淡風開爽氣多，數行新雁半空過，忙懷侍臣高力士，御園中洗掃費工夫，內園秋色無窮景，到處池塘有箋荷，少頃報說明皇到，寵幸拗妃左右扶，無數桂花香馥郁，有時鸚鵡目相呼，排開御宴花亭上，海味山珍滿席舖，纖纖玉手捧金壺，君按板，妃唱歌，霓裳妙舞世間無，太眞跪進三杯酒，天子含歡把御手扶，楊妃醉倒楊妃榻，一幅海棠春睡圖，見醉態醺容愈着了魔，那曉時，歡喜未完愁已到，說安祿山兵變逞干戈，直逼京帥奈若何，大唐天下承平久，文武朝臣禦敵無，速令六軍嚴護駕，忽怱車馬走長逮，暫避烽烟幸蜀都，可憐弱質如花女，王碎香消一幅羅，片時賜死在馬嵬坡。歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）五時一刻至六時一刻　　心琴曲（周璇）四姊妹（葉紅）春朝曲（徐健）催眠曲（葉英）文明結婚（葉英）愛的花（徐健）敎我如何不想她（姚敏）女兒經（周璇）　　華興（一二六〇）下午七時至七時三刻　　紫羅蘭（周璇）微微風（姚敏）風雨琴歌（徐　　健）贊美勇士（葉英）夜月之歌（葉英）歸程</p>

<p>(Guiyang) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Qian Dajun and others, flew from Yunnan to Guiyang on the 25th by Boeing aircraft. Those who welcomed him at the Qingzhen Airport included Liu Xing, Cao Jingyuan, Guo Siyan, Hao Mengling, and members of the provincial party headquarters, the heads of various departments of the provincial government, and several hundred division and brigade commanders. Tens of thousands of staff members from various agencies, civil organizations, and schools lined up along the road from Guiyang City to Touqiao to await his arrival. At precisely noon, the Boeing landed at the airport, and military music played loudly. All welcomers stood at attention and saluted. Chiang got off the plane, looking energetic and healthy, and nodded with a smile in response. He then entered Guiyang with Liu and rested at the commander's headquarters after taking a car. He met with various senior officials. Qian Dajun told reporters from the Central News Agency that his impression of Yunnan was excellent and that the officials and people of the province were particularly respectful and obedient to the leader with great enthusiasm. The remnants of the Xiao and He bandits have now fled to Heqing. Our Guo, Fan, and Li columns are still following them. The terrain there is complex, but the elimination of the remnants is imminent. Also, Liu Jianshu arrived in Qingzhen by plane from Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the 25th and immediately took a car into the city to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He will go to Yunnan to supervise the suppression of bandits soon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Remaining Bandits in Shanxi Still Attempting to Struggle; Our Army Decides to Adopt a Strategy of Encirclement; Pillboxes Along the Bandit Areas Are Being Actively Constructed; Large Numbers of Captured Bandits Released with Musical Accompaniment; Yang Hucheng Establishes Headquarters in Hancheng <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) In Qixian, Wucheng, Zhen, Beizhuang, Sujiazhuang, and other places, Guan's troops defeated the bandit army and seized dozens of mortars and machine guns, and over two hundred rifles. Over three hundred formal Red Army soldiers were captured. These captured goods have all been sent to the province. In addition to the previous award of 5,000 yuan to the division, an additional 8,000 yuan has now been awarded. Over a thousand Red Army soldiers have been captured by our forces on all routes and have been sent to the rear for rehabilitation, or provided with funds to return to their hometowns. Ninety-eight people, including Deng Changqing, the company commander of Peng Dehuai's bandit guard battalion, who were captured, recently expressed their complete awakening due to our preferential treatment and jointly published a letter of respect to the Red Army comrades, which was distributed to the bandit side to promote their awakening. Currently, Mao Zedong personally commands the remaining bandit troops. Our side has decided to adopt a strategy of encirclement, and pillboxes are being actively constructed along the bandit areas. Mao Xuzai, the Yulin Administrative Inspector Commissioner, came to Bing yesterday to meet Yan and Chen to report on the recent situation in northern Shaanxi. According to him, Liu Zidan has indeed been injured and is receiving medical treatment at Yongnian Fort in northern Shaanxi. The bandit forces in that area have been greatly reduced. Only a few remnants, including Wang Zhaoxiang, Liu Zidan, and his brother Jinfan, are left east of Yulin, each with no more than a few hundred people. Du Dichang, the false chief of staff of Zidan, was killed by Gao Guizi's troops, and the majority was disintegrated. Mao left Bing for Beijing this afternoon to attend the National Administrative Conference, accompanied by Kang Wang and his entourage, who returned to Suiyuan via Datong this morning. Kong Lingxun, the division commander of the Central Army, came to Bing last night to pay his respects. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The entire 4th Division of the pseudo-First Army Corps was intercepted by Guan Qizhen's troops. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to hold on and retreated. Guan's division joined Yang Chengyuan's troops to pursue. Guan believes that in this operation, the bandit army refused to surrender unless they were absolutely desperate, entirely because the bandit leaders used the slogan that the National Army killed prisoners to scare them. Therefore, the division captured 274 bandits and, with the approval of Chen Cheng, conducted separate training, provided them with food and drink, and gave each person ten yuan for travel expenses. They were escorted out of the city with a military band and released. The other captured pseudo-guerrilla teams were also released. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) In order to facilitate the command of the suppression of the remaining bandits, Yang Hucheng has specially established headquarters in Hancheng to command the Feng and Sun armies, quickly advancing towards northern Shaanxi, and blocking various crossings along the river, and establishing contact with friendly forces on both banks to prevent the bandits from fleeing west.

<p>Ning Shiyi Returns to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Red Bandits in northern Shaanxi crossed the river and invaded Jin City, they were eventually defeated by friendly forces between Zhongyang and Shilou. Some of our soldiers were also injured and transported back to Taiyuan for treatment. Chairman Chiang specially sent Ning Shiyi, a major general section chief of the military, to Bing at the beginning of the month with a large number of goods to represent his condolences to all the soldiers and to inspect the front lines and convey his words of encouragement. Ning completed his mission in Shanxi and arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 26th and is scheduled to report to Minister He in the morning of the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>剿匪 on the Borders of Shaanxi</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Our army recently pursued and suppressed the Red Bandits. According to reports: On the Shaanxi-North Shaanxi front, the bandit remnants in western Shanxi gathered west of Yonghe, Qingshui Pass, and Madou Pass, attempting to return to Shaanxi to cause trouble. Our Sun and Wang columns advanced north from Yichuan and Fushi on the 22nd. In the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, the remnants of Huang Ziven's bandits were defeated by our army. On the 19th, they led approximately six or seven hundred remnants of infantry and cavalry to Zhiluo Town in a state of extreme disarray. Our Chang column followed and suppressed them, arriving at Liuyazhen and Luomadian on the 23rd, capturing over a hundred bandits along the way and seizing fifty guns. The road they traversed was mountainous and rugged, with no traces of human habitation for over twenty years. Our army cleared the road while striving to advance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Report on the suppression of bandits in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area: According to reports, on the 22nd, the Xiao Jingguang unit of the pseudo-28th Army, approximately two thousand strong, fled from Zhi County back to Linzhen Town, north of Ganquan, in a state of exhaustion, indicating that they had suffered heavy losses in Shanxi. Since the 21st, over two thousand people from the pseudo-26th and 29th Armies have gathered in Ganquan and Fushi, attempting to resist the National Army. The pseudo-Shaanxi-Gansu Provincial Government has moved from Taotong to Xiadaigang, northwest of Ganquan. Several hundred bandits under Huang Ziven have fled to the Zhiluo Town area in a state of utter disarray. On the southern Shaanxi front, Chen Guangrui's bandits have fled to the Zhuling Pass area, where our army is fiercely suppressing them. Wang Sanchun's forces have fled to the Dahangxi area north of Wanyuan, where our army has captured many of them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Bandits in Eastern and Northern Fujian</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) After our army's strict encirclement and suppression of the bandits in various parts of eastern and northern Fujian, the main forces have suffered heavy losses and have lost the ability to invade. The Liu Ying bandits who scattered from Zhejiang, after being suppressed by one of our divisions, fled south to Dong Jiyang in Shouning, where they were intercepted by the Third Security Regiment. The bandits fled towards Xianfeng. On the 24th, a unit of the regiment actively advanced to search and suppress them. In this battle, one bandit leader and fourteen bandit soldiers were killed, two were captured, and three guns were seized. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Liu Ying bandits who fled to Xianfeng in Shouning were defeated by the Yi Qiji Regiment on the 25th, killing dozens of pseudo-officers and soldiers. Liu Ying barely escaped with his life. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A certain party purchases and transports reed salt in eastern Hebei for export and sells it at low prices in coastal towns, disrupting the salt business. The authorities have urged the Reed Salt Export General Office to be established quickly and to adopt a commercial management system. The Longlu Salt Envoy, who also serves as the General Manager, only supervises everything, while the actual responsibility lies with the commercial co-organizers. Two additional branch offices will be established to facilitate contact with purchasers and transporters. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has consolidated the salt industry, unified salt weights and prices, and gradually completed the work of raising salt taxes in order to reorganize the salt affairs. To facilitate management and reduce smuggling, it plans to build warehouses and mounds on various coasts. However, due to the enormous cost, it has specifically ordered the salt transport envoys of various coasts to prepare plans and submit them to the ministry for approval so that the situation can be weighed and implemented separately. This plan is a preparation for the implementation of the new salt law. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Ge Guangting, together with the newly appointed member of the Jiaoji Railway Song Ruoyu, came to Jinan from Qingdao at 7 AM on the morning of the 26th. Han Fuju and other important figures in the province went to the station to welcome them. After getting off the train, Ge accompanied Han and others to the stadium to watch the national martial arts provincial examination. According to Ge, the purpose of his visit to Jinan this time is to discuss with Chairman Han the issues of enlisting workers to build the Jinan-Liaocheng Road and raising private shares. The charter for this plan is currently being revised by the Ministry of Railways and preparations will be made as soon as it is promulgated. The road will be jointly operated by the government and commerce, with the provincial government, the Jiaoji Railway, and the Ministry of Railways each responsible for a portion of the construction funds. Private shares will be raised as much as possible, and it is planned to set up an office in Jinan in the future. The name is yet to be determined. All personnel will be transferred from the Jiaoji Railway in order to save costs. The Ministry of Railways has approved the extension of the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line. The required materials will be old materials from the Jiaoji Railway, and the labor cost is only several hundred thousand yuan. The line is relatively short, and the preparations are simple, so construction can begin soon. However, there are many mountains in Xintai and Laiwu, making construction difficult, so it can only be carried out slowly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Arab-Jewish Ethnic Conflict in Palestine <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The Arab-Jewish ethnic dispute in Palestine, which had been calm for many years, erupted again on the 19th due to a minor incident. The seriousness of the situation is no less than that of the 1929 "Wailing Wall" incident. According to dispatches from foreign news agencies, dozens of people have been killed or injured in clashes between Arabs and Jews. Transportation between Tel Aviv and Jaffa has been cut off. Arabs in the port of Haifa have launched a general strike. Many Jewish-owned shops have been forced to close. Demonstrations by both Arab and Jewish communities have resumed. It is difficult to predict how the situation will develop. However, based on the past history of Arab-Jewish ethnic disputes, this incident will not have a satisfactory ending in the short term.</p>
<p>Palestine is originally the homeland of the Jews. However, because they have been scattered around the world for a long time, the majority of the people living in Palestine are Arabs, numbering about 700,000. The Jews, on the other hand, are a minority, numbering only about 200,000. In recent years, Jews scattered around the world have suffered various abuses from governments of various countries and deeply felt the pain of not having a homeland. Therefore, they have the idea of rebuilding their homeland. The so-called Zionist organization aims to revive the Jewish homeland. During the Great War, Britain wanted to obtain the help of Jews from all over the world and promised to support the Jewish restoration movement. In November 1917, Lord Balfour, on behalf of the British government, issued a famous declaration, stating that "the British government is very willing to see the Jews build a national home in Palestine and is willing to provide various assistance to achieve this goal." After the war, Palestine was designated as a British Mandate. Therefore, the movement of Jews returning to their homeland became more rapid. Jews from all over the world organized groups, raised funds for the construction of their homeland, purchased land in Palestine, and relocated a large number of Jews back there. As a result, the power of the Jews in Palestine increased greatly, which aroused serious opposition from the local Arabs. Originally, the Arabs regarded Palestine as their place of residence. The large-scale invasion of the Jews to engage in the restoration movement was tantamount to infringing on the inherent rights of the Arabs. The two demands put forward by the Arabs in this conflict (restricting Jewish immigration and land acquisition) were aimed at this point. The Jews, on the other hand, believe that Palestine is their homeland. Now they are returning to their homeland to build a national home because they cannot bear the oppression of governments of various countries, which is very justified. Moreover, this restoration movement has been supported by Britain and the League of Nations. Although both sides have sufficient reasons, their actual interests cannot be reconciled after all. Moreover, their religions are different. Therefore, serious ethnic disputes break out from time to time. In the 1929 "Wailing Wall" incident, hundreds of people were killed or injured on both sides. Although no major disputes have occurred in recent years, recently, a serious conflict has erupted again due to a minor incident.</p>
<p>Britain's policy toward the Arab-Jewish ethnic conflict is ostensibly neutral and acts as a mediator. But in reality, it uses the conflict between the two communities to consolidate its rule in Palestine. We know that Palestine is a key location in the eastern Mediterranean, connecting the Suez Canal, and occupies an important position in transportation and military affairs. Britain will never give it up. To consolidate its ruling power in Palestine, the smartest way is to make full use of the conflict between the Arab and Jewish communities, so that they fight each other internally, and do not pay attention to British rule. Britain's support for the Jewish nation-building movement during the Great War and the change in its policy toward Palestine in 1930 were based on this principle. Under these circumstances, we sincerely hope that the Arab and Jewish communities can awaken, stop internal conflicts, and shift the focus of struggle. Only in this way can the oppressed Arab and Jewish communities gain complete liberation and not be subjected to imperialist fetters for a long time.</p>

<p>(Changchun) According to a report from a special correspondent of the Manchuria Daily here, the Japanese army's expeditionary force is having extreme difficulty fighting the anti-Japanese volunteers. Although the anti-Japanese volunteers live an inhuman life, they are full of spirit. In addition to being familiar with the terrain, every forest, mountain fortress, or village is vivid in their minds. They come out at night and avoid the strong and attack the weak. Moreover, local people guide them, so the Japanese army's expeditionary force is exhausted, suffers great blows, loses more than 100,000 lives, and spends hundreds of millions of Japanese yen. Therefore, unless the policy is changed to force the people to fight against the anti-Japanese volunteers together, it is difficult to weaken the strength of the anti-Japanese volunteers and achieve the success of governing Manchuria.

<h3 id="e53">A Look at the Depression in the Forestry Industry by Li Yin-gong, Agricultural College of National Central University <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Scholars rarely fail to attribute the decline of our national livelihood and the scarcity of products to the failure of agriculture and forestry education to follow the correct path. I dare not offer much rebuttal. I will focus on the depression in the forestry industry and offer a fair assessment, summarizing its major causes to inform the nation. The devastation of forests and woodlands in our country has reached its peak. On the one hand, the remaining forests lack accurate surveys of their volume (the Forestry Department of National Central University is undertaking this work and will publish its reports in installments). In international comparisons of resources, they are rarely included in statistics. On the other hand, the vast area of barren mountains and unproductive hills is disproportionate. Population density varies, and the need for fuel has not been universally met by replacing wood with coal. The industrial and commercial use of forest products is also in its infancy. Considering the national crisis, and even a tentative thought on national defense reserves, the direct and indirect supply that depends on forestry is limitless, yet the current situation is like this. How should we approach the plan to remedy this situation? This is a major question. In fact, there is a solution: focus on forestry administration, cultivate talent and land, be open and honest, remove obstacles, and do not sit idly by, paralyzed, to avoid committing the great sin of misleading the country. Then, there is hope. I will now describe the causes of the depression in our forestry industry in broad strokes as follows:</p>
<p>The Collective Application of Forestry Talent is Impossible. Our study of forestry is based on that of other countries. For more than twenty years, the number of people studying relevant subjects has been limited, as can be seen from the fact that the membership list of the Chinese Forestry Society has fewer than 150 people. Adding to this, the government has failed to employ them in accordance with their skills. Over time, many have changed careers, accounting for a significant portion. Some have failed in forestry and become discouraged. To this day, only half have persevered. Among them, disagreements are common, factions arise, and even unwillingness to cooperate and mutual undermining are inevitable. As a result, the lack of progress in national undertakings is undeniable.</p>
<p>The General Public Lacks Awareness of the Importance of Forestry. The Zhouli (Rites of Zhou) established officials to manage mountains and fields, a system that has not been followed for a long time. Later generations, such as Su Dongpo, planted mulberry trees to make a living, and Dai Junshan wrote "On Planting Trees," saying, "I secretly bear the ambition of the age, wanting to shelter all the people in the world, so that they do not lose their sustenance." Almost everyone regarded forestry as a long-term solution. The prevailing ethos of the late Qing Dynasty was superficial, with a focus on quick results obscuring long-term vision. Seeing that the benefits of forestry were slow to materialize, they were willing to abandon it. People in politics seem to have the mindset of "five days as magistrate of the capital," neglecting the long-term plan of "ten years to grow trees." To give an example from recent years, after traveling to Mount Huangshan, I saw that the trees there were thriving and that it was a place for the study of natural plants. I thought that a forest botanical garden should be established, imitating Mount Lu, to serve as a center for testing the products of the South China region. In addition to proposing this at the first meeting of the Huangshan Construction Committee, I repeatedly appealed to the authorities, but was never adopted. How could one not be discouraged? Such things are too numerous to mention. Furthermore, in the agricultural community, there are those who hold important positions in agricultural education or testing agencies who either downplay forestry or dismiss it as insignificant. This is also unwise. Furthermore, in provinces known as pioneers, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the annual agricultural and forestry administration system is changed almost every year, either due to the inconstancy of trusting people or due to budget cuts that lead to reorganization. As a result, local undertakings are frequently destroyed. Even more so, local forestry administration does not aim at talent but rather harmonizes factions and distributes power equally. At best, its regulatory power is limited to superficial formalities and completing a task. May I ask, can the lifeline that is crucial to national prosperity and the cause of saving the nation be carried out in this way for long?</p>
<p>Forestry Administration Seems Nonexistent; Rare to Hear of National Operations. Our country's forestry administration began around the same time as the early Republic of China, but the promulgation of the Forest Law is still recent. The current Ministry of Industry has an estimate of the area of forests and barren mountains nationwide, which I will not discuss for now. As for state-owned forests, only central forest areas are managed, and the scope is too small. Moreover, protective forests have not been established, so it is no wonder that disasters continue. The management of provincial forests has not been unified, so it is no wonder that each province acts on its own. There has been no consultation with the Ministry of Interior to investigate land, and suitable land is not being utilized. There has been no consultation with the Ministry of Finance, so the expansion of state-owned forests, the purchase of barren mountains, and the protection and other facilities are without funds. All these are points that our country should pay attention to in the future. Even if the government does not want central control of forestry administration, it must delegate power to the localities and constantly supervise and audit their achievements from the central government, and examine and approve their plans. In short, if everything has not yet been put on the right track, then the responsibility of leadership lies with the government. Once the business becomes tense, then rely on experts to work together to assist. Given the current state of our country's mountains and wilderness, the management of forestry cannot be accomplished by the manpower and financial resources of one side alone. I have always believed that land area is limited and close to villages should be entrusted to small farmers to do their best to integrate agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Vast areas away from villages should encourage local public groups to operate, and even impose barren mountain taxes to encourage them. The entry of the state may be limited to protection forests, which is lighter and easier, but it must employ the right people, so that their interactions are evident, and the expenditure of funds must be public, so as to reduce waste.</p>
<p>The Protection of Forests and Woodlands Lacks Effective Measures. According to advanced forestry countries in the East and West, huge sums of money are spent annually on protection administration as a matter of course. The methods of protection all start with the strict implementation of severe laws to warn the stubborn. Over time, the people develop habits and do not violate the forests in the slightest. Our country cannot do this, so most forests have been destroyed. Therefore, if we want to develop forestry in the future, the protection of political power is indispensable. Moreover, the soil layer of most of today's barren mountains is still thick and usable, especially the hills in the south and central regions, where there are many wild tree species. Here is a table of the percentage of wild trees in the school's Bufu Forest Farm:</p>
<p>[Missing table data]</p>
<p>The trees in the table represent the types of miscellaneous trees that grow naturally in Nanjing. If they are not destroyed in winter, or if villagers are restricted to only cutting grass and not damaging the cone trees, a native forest will inevitably rise up in three to five years. Those who have traveled to Mount Lu deeply feel that the forests of that mountain can be protected in this way without the need for artificial procedures. How many such places are there in various provinces? Moreover, those who carry firewood for a living in towns and cities should be subject to police inspection. If they have invaded a protected forest, they should be fined for selling and buying the same crime. Over time, this abuse can be stopped.</p>
<p>Since our country's forestry has fallen into a state of depression due to various reasons, the remedies, at least, are systems that cultivate talents with forestry administration, as mentioned earlier. If we do not pay attention to this, then there is no hope for the revival of forestry. I have always admired the Indian forestry of the British, with the merits of Mr. Schlich being well-known. The forests of the United States were founded by Mr. Fernow, and the rapid progress of Japanese forestry was guided by Mr. Matsuno, whose great achievements are still in people's minds today. Is there no one in our forestry industry willing to work hard to build and break this depression? What I say here is not intended to imitate the Japanese forestry scholars' criticism of the government, complaining about the current world. I hope those who can redeem the situation will understand.

<p>(Rome) With the help of its bombing planes, the Italian army is now encircling Addis Ababa from three sides: north, south, and east. The headquarters of the Italian army in the southeast is making every effort to prepare for a major offensive, which is expected to take place imminently. There are now 3,000 trucks carrying the last batch of soldiers and supplies to the front lines. It is expected that the resistance of the Southern army will not be able to prevent the Italian army from reaching or entering Addis Ababa. All fronts are advancing today. The Second Asgari Division, advancing southwest from Tesh, has reportedly met no resistance. A column composed of White and Black soldiers, advancing from Gondar, has reportedly occupied Bahardar, where Lake Tana and the Blue Nile converge. The Italian army on the southern front occupied Sasabane and Daga Bur after yesterday, making it difficult to defend the two key points of Harar and Jijiga for long. The "Hindenburg Line" defending these two places has reportedly been breached by the Italian army. According to battle reports from Mogadishu, the first phase of the battle of Sasabane yesterday was one of the most intense battles on the southern front. Although the Southern army bravely resisted the Italian army's advance, it was ultimately ineffective. Before the Italian army attacked, 40 aircraft bombed the two towns of Sasabane and Daga Bur, using a total of 16 tons of high explosives. (Reuters, 26th) Rome Officials here today confirmed that Daga Maduro, an important defensive position on the Southern army's Hindenburg Line, has been occupied by the Italian army. After being forced to withdraw, the Southern army counterattacked fiercely, but it was ultimately ineffective. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Southern army is now entrenched in trenches in the city of Sasabane, in the Wogaden province of the south, tenaciously resisting. Three Italian columns are attacking from the southwest in two routes, having now surrounded the city of Sasabane. The closest of these is the motorized unit of the Libyan Division, led by General Navarre. After departing from the village of Sigega, it has now occupied the village of Daga Lido, which is the meeting point of the caravan routes between Daga Bur and Sasabane. In addition, a column led by General Frusci, moving up the Fafan River valley, faces the most difficult task, as it will come into contact with the main force of the Southern army after crossing the Fafan River at Hamanle. Another column, led by General Agostini, has now reached the city of Gunugadu, which is 30 kilometers southeast of Sasabane. (Havas News Agency, 25th) (Rome) General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a communique stating that "General Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian army on the southern front, has launched another attack on the Southern army's defenses in the Sasabane area, the so-called 'Hindenburg Line.' His subordinate, General Vanerna, leading a motorized column, unexpectedly occupied the village of Daga Lido on the 23rd of this month. On the 24th and 25th, the Southern army launched fierce counterattacks and engaged in fierce battles with the Italian army, but all were repelled by the Italian army. In this battle, the Italian army lost 20 officers and native soldiers, and about 90 were wounded." (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Villacoublay French aviator Mr. Truillet recently planned to fly a plane purchased by the Southern King to Southern country, but was prohibited by order of the French authorities. The aviator today requested permission to move the plane from its storage place in order to inspect its machinery, unexpectedly taking advantage of this opportunity to secretly fill the oil tank with enough gasoline for a thousand-mile flight and suddenly flew away. The guards tried to stop him, but were unable to. Local officials have now issued an arrest warrant to apprehend him, as he has taken away items sealed by the authorities. (Reuters, 26th) Versailles French aviator Truillet, who was hired as an aviation advisor to the Southern country's royal army, suddenly flew away at 1:30 PM today from Villacoublay Airfield, piloting his own American plane. He soared into the sky and never returned. He did not obtain permission from the police beforehand, and his actions are obviously suspicious. Previously, Truillet claimed that the plane would be used for flights between the French port of Djibouti and the Southern country's capital, but the authorities sealed it because the procedures for importing the plane from the United States were not in accordance with regulations, and closely monitored it in the aircraft hangar. Truillet had repeatedly requested the authorities to move the plane out of the hangar so that he could inspect the parts on site to see if they were damaged. This afternoon, the authorities only allowed him to test-fly the plane, but he unexpectedly deceived the authorities and flew away.</p>

Although the polling stations opened at 8:00, voters began to arrive gradually at 9:00. French President Lebrun was one of the first to vote. The number of voters increased towards noon. The results will be announced by the Ministry of the Interior via wireless radio, but the real competition between the left and right wings will not be known until the runoff election is held on May 3rd. Twelve current cabinet members and five chairmen are expected to be re-elected, and several important figures, such as left-wing leader and former cabinet member Herriot, former Prime Minister Daladier, central party leader Marin, and independent leader Boisson, are also likely to be elected.

<h3 id="e64">Scene of Yesterday's Voting; Women Enthusiastic About Participating in Politics; Paper Top Hats Used as Ballot Boxes <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies election began this morning. At 9:10, President Lebrun and his secretary-general, Magre, left the presidential palace and went to a polling station near the presidential palace to vote. By 10:00, people were thronging in various districts of Paris, all of whom were voters. The number of people in front of each polling station had increased dramatically, naturally leading to a state of crowding and urgency. However, order was maintained in all places. Mrs. Weiss and Mrs. Fina were enthusiastic about the women's suffrage movement. Although they knew that they had no chance of being elected, they also put forward symbolic candidacies and set up two informal polling offices on Montparnasse Street and Saint-Michel Road. By 10:30, these places were also bustling. There were no ballot boxes inside, so several paper top hats were placed upside down on the table to serve as ballot boxes. A large number of male and female voters also voted there. (Havas News Agency, 26th) (Paris) Today is the day of the Chamber of Deputies election. Judging from the situation this morning, the number of voters is likely to set a new record since the European War, at least in Paris. Since 8:00 AM, various polling stations in this area have been overcrowded. These polling stations are all located in municipal elementary schools. Voters, whether rich or poor, have to wait for 25 minutes before they can vote. This situation is the same in all districts. In some districts, voters even lined up in long queues, standing in the rain and waiting for a long time before they could vote. All of these voters were calm and self-possessed, without any noise. The topic of their conversations was mainly "avoiding war," which shows that they are all aware of the seriousness of the current situation. In addition, there were many interesting stories to tell about today's voting. For example, most of the voters in a certain district were workers, who were poor. These people brought their wives and children to the polling station. The men proudly entered the polling station to fulfill their national obligations, while the women gathered at the entrance of the polling station to wait. Then they raised their hands and shouted to their husbands, "In the next election, you will vote together with us!" This sentence is meaningful and a microcosm of a unique demonstration movement, which broke the silent atmosphere of today's day off. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Estimated Number of Seats for Each Party; Victory of the Left Can Be Foreseen <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) There are a total of 618 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies. The results of today's first round of voting are expected to yield 250 seats. Candidates in each electoral district who have not won a majority will be required to participate in a runoff election next Sunday. In today's first round of voting, each party will vote for one candidate from its own party. By the time of the second round of voting next Sunday, the parties of the left wing belonging to the Popular Front have agreed in advance that once the first round of voting is over, they will determine which party has the most votes and will elect the candidate of that party in the second round of voting in order to seek victory. The parties of the right wing have not concluded such an agreement, and the general public therefore expects that the parties belonging to the Popular Front will win 350 seats, more than the 317 seats in the previous election by more than 30 seats. The general public also believes that the Communist Party, due to its emphasis on patriotism, will seize a number of seats from the Socialist Party, increasing from 10 seats to 35 seats. As for the Radical Socialist Party, it is estimated by Leon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party, that about 50 of the elected members of the Radical Socialist Party will declare their departure from the Popular Front. As a result, the parties belonging to the Popular Front may not be able to form a new cabinet at that time. There were 615 members in the previous Chamber of Deputies (3 more members in this session). Among them, 521 members are still running in this election. In the current cabinet, all cabinet members who are members of the Chamber of Deputies, except for Minister of Health Nicole, who has left political life due to illness, are candidates in this election. In addition, there are 60 members of the previous Chamber of Deputies who do not want to run for election. Former Prime Minister and leader of the Central Republican Party, Theodore, is one of them. Theodore is strongly opposed to the current parliamentary system. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The general election for the Chamber of Deputies, scheduled to begin tomorrow, saw Prime Minister Sal lau deliver a radio broadcast this evening to conclude the campaign. He stated, "During this election campaign, each political party has expressed a fundamental concept: a deep concern for the destiny of France, and a willingness to cooperate in seeking the welfare, prosperity, glory, and security of France." Regarding foreign policy, he said, "All disputes, whether unresolved or potentially arising in the future, should be resolved through a collective security system. Whether national construction is possible should be the prerequisite." Regarding domestic affairs, he stated that the French people enjoy freedom of speech and public order is respected, which is beyond the reach of other nations. "France remains unwavering in its commitment to the republican system and the free rights of democracy. Once this election concludes, it will be clearly demonstrated that all disruptive elements, regardless of their party or faction, will come to their senses and behave themselves. The government, in maintaining domestic order, will no longer need to resort to legal constraints." Regarding economic issues, he said that the next cabinet should prioritize economic recovery, achieved through close cooperation between the state and private enterprises. However, to achieve economic recovery, it is essential to end the current state of global economic disorder, where distinct nationalistic economic barriers exist, manipulating currencies and dumping goods as instruments of this doctrine. This inevitably leads to retaliatory measures, such as import quotas and increased tariffs. This chaotic state is utterly absurd, and an international conference should be convened to address it, regardless of which countries are willing to participate. Finally, the Prime Minister stated that France's budget situation is quite favorable and its economic conditions have clearly improved. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Palestine: Jewish-Arab Conflict Evolves into Political Action; Arabs Implement Strikes and Boycotts <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jerusalem: The conflict between Jews and Arabs here has been ongoing for days. It began as religious fervor that evolved into riots with ethnic strife characteristics. However, it has now gradually evolved into purely political action. For example, the strike is backed by unions and mass gatherings, which are strictly controlled and directed. It is evident that this was pre-planned. As with the strike, other riots are also similar. However, officials have issued warnings to Arab leaders that further riots will be met with military suppression. This warning prevented a large-scale demonstration. Currently, the tragedy of armed conflict between Jews and Arabs seems unlikely, but the situation remains serious. The strike, initially expected to end quickly, is now likely to be prolonged and without a solution in sight. Arab leaders met all day today to discuss the situation, focusing primarily on the issues of continuing the strike and anti-Jewish strife. They did not adjourn until 8 p.m. It is reported that the Arabs have formed a high-level committee dedicated to enforcing the leaders' orders and coordinating the strike's forces. Within the province, incidents continue to occur, and unrest persists. In Tulkarm, a violent riot was followed by a serious demonstration, but authorities effectively prevented it from escalating. In Beisan and Nahalal, Arab arsonists burned crops in the fields. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: A special report from our correspondent states that after the Arabs declared strikes and boycotts, agriculture has spread throughout Palestine. The streets are sparsely populated with vehicles, and shops are closed, creating a desolate scene, as if the entire city is on holiday. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: A special report from our correspondent states that Arab leaders held a meeting yesterday and decided to adopt extraordinary measures to force people to accept the decision to strike and boycott. They also decided to set fire to any shops that remain open and, if necessary, to order schools to close. A major fire recently occurred in the Old City of Jerusalem. In addition, the Arab Higher Committee (headed by the Grand Mufti) has decided to put forward three minimum conditions for resolving the conflict: Immediate prohibition of Jewish immigration to Palestine; Prohibition of land sales to Jews; and Formation of an Arab national government. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has issued a statement to Jews in Palestine and around the world, detailing the nation's construction efforts in Palestine, stating that they will continue this work fearlessly.

<h3 id="e68">Japanese-Soviet Negotiations: Resolving Border Disputes; Arita Proposes Eastern Demarcation Committee; Soviets Say Peaceful Atmosphere Needed Throughout <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to sources here, the first conversation between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev focused solely on the organization of the border commission. Foreign Minister Arita stated that he does not oppose the organization of a commission for the entire Manchurian-Soviet border in principle, but under current circumstances, a committee to redraw the boundary line and resolve border disputes can only be established in the eastern part of the border.</p>
<p>The Soviet Ambassador replied that although the facts regarding the border issue are already very clear, the Soviet Union is still prepared to accept the Japanese government's proposal to establish a demarcation committee in the east, but a strong atmosphere of peace must exist throughout the entire border. In addition, the Soviet Ambassador also drew the Japanese Foreign Minister's attention to the importance of organizing similar committees for Outer Mongolia and Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied that although the establishment of such a committee is necessary, this issue is not directly related to Japan. Therefore, under current circumstances, only a demarcation committee needs to be established on the eastern border. Foreign Minister Arita also asked the Soviet Ambassador to convey his views to the Soviet government and hoped for an early response from the Soviet authorities. The Soviet Ambassador immediately agreed to convey the Japanese government's views but immediately pointed out that a peaceful atmosphere should be promulgated throughout the entire border, not just in one part. (TASS, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the 22nd of this month, Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota hosted a farewell banquet for the former Japanese military attache at the Soviet Embassy, and a welcome reception for the newly appointed military attache. The Chairman of the Defense Committee, Voroshilov, Yegorov, and other key Soviet figures were in attendance. Ota delivered a speech saying that although there are various misunderstandings between Japan and the Soviet Union, they can all be resolved peacefully. Therefore, he strongly agreed with the statement made by the Chairman of the Soviet Defense Committee, "The Soviet Union is not afraid of war, but does not want to see war break out." The Japanese government is also seeking peace and avoiding war. If the current economic problems can be resolved, the relationship between the two countries will inevitably become closer.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Chairman of the Soviet Defense Committee, Voroshilov, replied, "I strongly agree with the views of the Japanese Ambassador, because there is nothing that cannot be resolved between Japan and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Soviet government not only wishes to live in peace, but also strives for world peace. Therefore, it has previously requested to sign a non-aggression treaty to peacefully resolve various border disputes. However, border conflicts have increased in recent months. Although these conflicts are by no means provoked by the Red Army and border guards, their results will inevitably make the relationship between the two countries worse. Therefore, the Soviet government hopes that if the Japanese government is sincere in its efforts for peace, it must immediately stop the provocative actions of irresponsible personnel. The Soviet Union's unchanging policy of peace often leads to incorrect perceptions, believing that the Soviet government is cowardly. Mr. Hata is about to return home to take up the post of Director of the Intelligence Department of the Military Affairs Bureau. I (Voroshilov) sincerely hope that Mr. Hata will use his personal status to truthfully inform the Japanese people of the correct information and the truth that the Soviet Union loves peace."</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita intends to clarify the direction of Japanese diplomatic policy in a speech to the special parliament.

He specifically denied any provocative actions on the Japanese side regarding the Japanese-Soviet conflict and stated that a Japanese-German alliance was not under consideration, which greatly influenced domestic and foreign affairs.

<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Baba will deliver a financial speech in parliament. The relevant departments are currently drafting a concrete plan. It is understood that the general direction of economic policy is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improving Financial Institutions: Mobilizing special banks such as the Hypothec Bank of Japan and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to thoroughly improve rural villages and rural finance. The goal is to establish rural financial institutions that do not aim to profit. General private banks should also act as public institutions to fulfill their mission and strengthen control. At the same time, the government should consider a guarantee system for the active activities of financial institutions in the industrial sector.</p>
<p>(2) Public Debt Policy: Improving financial and economic policies to increase the digestion of public bonds is a given. However, at times, the government may force savings banks, various government mutual aid organizations, and other financial institutions to purchase public bonds to expand their legislative means.</p>
<p>(3) Interest Rate Policy: The administrative power over banks, trust companies, unlimited credit organizations, insurance companies, etc., under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance should be transferred to the Ministry of Finance as much as possible. If transfer is not possible, close contact should be maintained with these financial institutions to thoroughly lower interest rates and promote the development of industry and trade. Implementation should be gradual, avoiding malicious inflation. At the same time, the economic repercussions and interest rate policies resulting from tax increases should be appropriately adjusted.

<p>Tenth, "Helping others is the root of happiness." We, as human beings, naturally seek happiness, but if we seek it in the wrong way, we will only find pain and create evil. For example, some people think that idle amusement, gambling, and dissipation are happiness, not knowing that these things are not only not happiness but also waste our energy, destroy our lives, increase our sins, and cause pain. They do not know that the greatest happiness of the human heart is to help others. The ancients said, "The more one does for others, the more one has for oneself; the more one gives to others, the more one receives." They also said, "Doing good is the greatest joy," meaning that the more we can help others, the more beneficial it is for us, and the happier we will be. There is a tenet of the Boy Scouts, "Do a good deed every day," which is also to help others. For example, rescuing from drowning, putting out fires, helping the elderly, protecting the young, and assisting the poor, hungry, injured, and sick—no matter how small the deed, it is doing good. Doing good can bring true happiness. All compatriots of the Republic of China should seek happiness in this way, loving each other and helping each other. As long as we have a bit of strength, we must do our best to help our compatriots. This is great happiness.</p>
<p>Eleventh, "Knowledge is the root of serving the world." This means that we must have knowledge and ability to serve the world and save the people, as Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge." On the other hand, it also means that the purpose of our studying all kinds of knowledge and skills is to serve the world and save people, not without purpose or meaning, not for personal comfort and security, and even less for using knowledge and skills to harm others and benefit ourselves, to commit evil acts. That serving the world requires knowledge, and that knowledge is the principle of serving the world, should already be clear to everyone. In particular, educators must thoroughly explain this to young students.</p>
<p>Twelfth, "Perseverance is the root of success." We all hope to be successful and achieve something in our lives. What is the most important condition for success? It is perseverance. Whatever we do, we must continue to work hard, not give up halfway or be fickle. We must have a beginning and an end, and see it through to the end. Especially if we want to succeed in a lifelong career, we must choose a bright and righteous path, strive forward, and never change until death, fulfilling the last two sentences of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, "With one heart and one mind, persevere from beginning to end." For example, building a road—if we don't build it, we don't build it; but if we build it, we must build it all the way from the starting point to the ending point. No matter how many obstacles there are along the way, we must break through them until the entire route is connected. It should not be like the past situation in Sichuan, where a section is built in the east and another in the west. Before route A is completed, route B is started. As a result, although many sections are built, no road is completed. Such construction, even if it is a thousand sections or ten thousand miles, is useless. Therefore, whether we build roads or do any other large or small undertaking, we must always persevere, always be thorough, and always connect, which means we must constantly strive to improve ourselves, see it through to the end, and only then can we achieve true success.</p>
<p>The twelve principles mentioned above are the fundamental keys to our success in life and work, and the precious rafts for our revolution and nation-building. Today, I especially offer them to all comrades and compatriots in Sichuan. I hope that in the future, parents will use them to teach their children, officials will use them to teach their subordinates, and the government will use them to teach the people, so that all compatriots in Sichuan can put these twelve principles into practice. If so, I believe that the progress of Sichuan and the entire country will be rapid and unlimited. Finally, I have a few words to add about the matter of compulsory labor. Now, people generally know that the method of labor service is very beneficial to the people's physical and mental health and the order of society, so there is probably no doubt about it. However, there are many misunderstandings and complaints about the method of compulsory labor, especially in Sichuan. Originally, after a country or a place is restored to order and is in the midst of difficult construction, to universally mobilize the people to undertake any new cause, even if it is a cause that is very beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and is very closely related, at first, the people always feel inconvenient and inevitably have complaints. Not to mention compulsory labor, which is a laborious task, even when the government wants to interfere with ordinary and minor matters such as public sanitation and cleanliness, the people will initially feel inconvenienced and harbor resentment. Especially when a new system is implemented, because of inadequate planning, incomplete personnel, lack of experience, etc., it is inevitable that malpractices will occur, making it all the more difficult for the people to feel pain and have complaints. This all depends on the government authorities and those who are responsible for education to consider the situation and guide them effectively. As for the matter of compulsory labor, it should originally be done during the slack season of farming so that the people can have time to work. Especially during the busy spring farming season, we should take into account the people's livelihood and sympathize with their suffering. Therefore, I have decided to issue an order that, except for the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, which must continue to requisition labor for construction due to special circumstances, the compulsory labor on all other roads will be suspended for one month. However, the people of Sichuan should know that compulsory labor is not limited to road construction. In the future, projects that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as dredging rivers, afforestation, and building dikes, will all require labor. Our labor will never be wronged or difficult. Our labor service for the country and society is to create blessings for ourselves and our descendants. For example, after the highway is completed, not only can bandits be suppressed and the people can live and work in peace and contentment forever, but also progress and development can be achieved in all aspects of the economy, culture, and education, which will be of great benefit. We hope that all intellectuals will be responsible for educating the people in various ways so that they can understand, enjoy labor service, help others, and serve the world. I had a special feeling when I took a cargo ship from Hubei to Sichuan, which was to see the towering mountains of the Three Gorges. Yu the Great was able to dredge them by human power thousands of years ago. At that time, I really did not know how much effort your Sichuan ancestors had put in and how much blood and sweat they had shed. I think that such a difficult water conservancy project, in the era before machines were invented, and to succeed in such a great industry, the number of conscripted laborers who starved and froze to death was countless, and the number of people who were drowned for this dredging of the river was unknown to be thousands or tens of thousands of lives. From this, it can be seen that you Sichuan people not only have the ability to do great labor and construction, but also have the spirit of sacrificing oneself to benefit others, forgetting oneself for the sake of the public, and creating boundless welfare for future generations. Everyone, please think about it, if the Sichuan people's predecessors had not been able to exert the ability of labor service and the spirit of sacrificing everything to dredge the Three Gorges and channel the river, I am afraid that Sichuan would still be a world of wild beasts, and we would still be able to live and work in peace and contentment there. Since your Sichuan ancestors were able to dredge the towering mountains of the Three Gorges and create blessings for our future generations, do the current Sichuan people not have the ability to build a few highways? What is so strange about this small matter of road construction that it is worth complaining about? We cannot restore the inherent spirit of our ancestors and strive to improve ourselves, so we are not worthy of being the descendants of the Chinese nation, and we are also ashamed to be Sichuan people. I sincerely hope that in the future, the people of Sichuan must carry forward the great spirit of labor service of their ancestors, create boundless happiness for the country, for their compatriots, and for future generations, and complete the basic cause of revolution and nation-building with your Sichuan people's great spirit and courage, creating a permanently glorious history for the people of Sichuan.

<h3 id="e77">The First Phase of the Alberta Province's Three-Year Plan Completed: Entering the Stage of Ten New Constructions; Second Phase of the Plan About to Commence <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Guangdong Province promulgated the Three-Year Administration Plan in June of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], it was decided to commence implementation on January 1st of the 22nd year [1933]. Now that the three-year term is complete, the Guangdong authorities have decided to continue to revise the second phase of the Three-Year Plan, designating the first half of this year as a period of assessment and investigation. This involves reviewing the progress of past work and investigating the actual needs of the current social environment to determine the second phase of the Three-Year Plan. Currently, in addition to relevant agencies submitting detailed reports on the implementation of the past plan, the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction Departments have all recently made inspection tours to various counties to conduct on-the-ground investigations and broad consultations, using these findings as reference for drafting the second phase of the Three-Year Plan. As for the achievements of the first phase of the Three-Year Administration Plan, they already possess considerable value, as the plan represents a systematic approach to governance by the local government, stipulating various administrative procedures to enable cooperation among different sectors for step-by-step implementation. The aim is to build a new Guangdong in terms of politics, economy, education, and construction. Moreover, these plans are based on the platform and policies of the Kuomintang. The personnel responsible within the authorities possess a spirit of hard work and progress, leading to numerous achievements. An overview from various perspectives is as follows:</p>
<p>Political Aspect: Politically, it is easy to see significant achievements in public security. Guangdong has historically been a region where bandits gathered, especially in areas such as Guangzhou Bay, which were governed by foreigners. This facilitated the smuggling of arms, indirectly creating opportunities for bandit activity. Bandits often established affiliations, kidnapped people for ransom, looted in all directions, and extorted fees, causing havoc for three to four decades. Furthermore, Haifeng, Lufeng, Qiongyai, Suyang, and Huilai Kunyun Nanshan, among other places, were occupied by Red bandits [Communists]. The mutual collusion of Red and ordinary bandits became a major disaster in Guangdong Province. However, after the implementation of the Three-Year Administration Plan, five pacification zones were delineated, each with a dedicated commissioner responsible for pacification. At the same time, local guard teams were actively organized to strengthen local defense capabilities. Consequently, not only were the Communist bandits within the territory suppressed, but various bandit gangs were also wiped out. Currently, the people live in peace, and commerce is unhindered, which is considered by the people of Guangdong to be the most satisfactory and commendable achievement. Moreover, the corruption among Guangdong officials was historically more severe than in any other province, a deeply entrenched problem since the late Qing Dynasty. However, in the past two to three years, there has been some change. First, the highest authorities have shown considerable determination in rectifying officialdom. Second, the heads of county finance bureaus are directly appointed by the provincial finance department, making them not personal associates of the county magistrate and thus less susceptible to corruption. Third, the Department of Civil Affairs regularly sends personnel to conduct inspections. If evidence of corruption is discovered, strict punishment is swiftly meted out. Consequently, there have been numerous cases in the past two to three years of county magistrates being dismissed, detained, and even executed for corruption, leading to a transformation in the ethos of officialdom.</p>
<p>Financial Aspect: Guangdong was originally known as a wealthy region, so the finances of Guangdong should have been quite affluent. In reality, the economy of Guangdong relies heavily on remittances from overseas Chinese and exports of raw silk as its two main pillars. In recent years, it has been affected by the global economic downturn. The price of raw silk has plummeted, and remittances from overseas Chinese have also shrunk, naturally leading to a reduction in various tax revenues. The finances of Guangdong have therefore faced considerable difficulties. However, the Guangdong authorities have not sought improper sources of income or increased taxes. Instead, they have cut more than 120 types of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, amounting to a total of over 6 million silver dollars per year. Administrative expenses have been paid at 80%, and measures have been taken to eliminate corruption and embezzlement in financial matters to increase public revenue. After two to four reorganizations, the monthly salary amount has also increased by over 30,000 silver dollars. In this way, the finances of Guangdong can still be sustained. As for abolishing land taxes and switching to land value taxes, the aim is to reduce the long-standing problems of having land without taxes, having taxes without land, and embezzlement in household registration, which demonstrates considerable diligence. The transition to land value taxes is now almost complete. However, there are also many problems here. Instead of relying on people's reported land value for taxation, an evaluation committee is organized to assess land prices for taxation. Land varies in fertility and accessibility. A slight oversight can easily lead to disputes. It is reported that the government is in the process of adjusting. Second, after the conversion to land value tax, all land tax surcharges are supposed to be eliminated, but some places still retain many surcharges, which in turn increases the burden on the people. The government has recently issued a clear order prohibiting the private collection of land tax surcharges.</p>
<p>Educational Aspect: In the past two to three years, the education authorities have placed great emphasis on promoting compulsory education and vocational education, which is very suitable for the actual requirements of China's environment. The extent of progress can be illustrated by statistical figures. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], there were 18,969 elementary schools in the province, with 1,098,926 students. By the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], there were 22,754 elementary schools, with 1,469,401 students. Education expenditure paid by the provincial treasury (excluding local funds) was 2,134,425 yuan in the 19th year of the Republic [1930]. By the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], it had increased to 4,332,270 yuan, nearly doubling. In the 24th year of the Republic [1935], an additional 100,600 yuan was added to expand secondary school classes, and over 350,000 yuan was newly established for vocational and normal schools. Subsidies were provided to various counties for running short-term elementary schools and increasing compulsory education, totaling 250,000 yuan (including 120,000 yuan in central government subsidies). This is an additional 700,000 yuan. In recent years, Guangdong's financial revenue has decreased, while education expenditure has increased annually, demonstrating the great effort exerted by the education administration.</p>
<p>Construction Aspect: The Guangdong government has decided to manage major industries with government financial resources. In the Three-Year Administration Plan, there were plans to establish cotton mills, silk weaving factories, woolen mills, jute textile mills, sulfuric acid and soda factories, phosphate fertilizer plants, nitrogen fertilizer plants, paper mills, sugar mills, alcohol distilleries, refined salt manufacturing plants, corn alcohol distilleries, insecticide manufacturing plants, Xisha Islands guano fertilizer manufacturing plants, vegetable oil oleic acid factories, oil manufacturing plants, Shanwei aquatic product manufacturing plants, mechanized peanut oil factories, improved agricultural tool manufacturing plants, fishing boat manufacturing plants, new fishing gear manufacturing plants, steel plants, and the Wengjiang hydroelectric power plant, totaling 24 factories. Of these, the alcohol distillery, sulfuric acid factory, soda factory, wood charcoal automobile factory, silk weaving and woolen textile mills, cotton mills, jute textile mills, nitrogen fertilizer plant, phosphate fertilizer plant, and sugar mill have already been established. The paper mill, steel plant, and Wengjiang hydroelectric power plant are in preparation but have not yet been established. The established factories all have products, the trademark being "Five Years Brand", with a management office in Shanghai for promotion. Among these, sugar has been the most successful, because Guangdong's land and climate are particularly suitable for growing sugarcane. In the past, when sugar was produced by traditional methods, there were over 10 million yuan in native sugar exports. Later, after the intrusion of machine-made foreign sugar, the native sugar gradually declined, and ordinary farmers could not maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the Guangdong government resolutely established factories and purchased machinery to squeeze sugarcane in the Three-Year Plan. The sugar produced is no different from foreign sugar. Since then, not only has the import of foreign sugar decreased, but the sugar produced can also be sold throughout the country. The provincial government believes that sugarcane sugar has great potential and is actively expanding it. It has now planned to establish ten major sugar factories throughout the province. Currently, the Panyu Xinzhao and Shitou factories, Jieyang factory, Huiyang factory, and Shunde factory are in production. The Dongguan factory, Nanlu Haikang factory, and Qiongyai factory are in preparation. The plan for ten major sugar factories will not be difficult to realize in the future. However, the raw material of sugarcane may not be sufficient in the future. Currently, only five factories have been completed, and the supply of raw materials is already facing difficulties. If ten major sugar factories are established one after another, what will be the supply of raw materials? This is not an easy problem to solve. Although the government has a plan for developing rural areas in the Three-Year Plan and has decided to convert some mulberry fields into sugarcane fields and reclaim wasteland for planting sugarcane, as well as provide low-interest loans to farmers for planting sugarcane, and has contacted the Shanghai Bank in Shanghai to allocate 1.4 million yuan for handling freight loans in Guangdong branches, this may not be able to solve the problem. In fact, sugarcane planting is not suitable for newly reclaimed wasteland, and there is not so much mature land. If rice fields are converted, it will affect the problem of people's food. If rapid success is desired, the government must find a way to improve the soil of newly reclaimed wasteland, because this is not something that ordinary farmers can do.</p>
<p>Rural Aspect: Rural areas have suffered due to the decline in raw silk exports and the reduction in remittances from overseas Chinese. Small industries, such as the tobacco from Heshan, oranges from Xinhui, tangerines from Xinhui, and the sunflower fans from Gaoyao, have all experienced reduced exports, affecting rural poverty. All industrial and commercial enterprises have become sluggish. Fortunately, in recent years, due to political stability, there have been no wars or bandit disasters. In particular, the government has reduced 120 kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, which has reduced the burden on rural areas and alleviated some of the difficulties. It is reported that the government has considered many ways to alleviate poverty in rural areas. The first phase of the Three-Year Plan also included a rural construction plan, but the results were very small. The main reasons are: first, water conservancy is not developed; second, rural areas are poor; third, the production technology of farmers is poor. If a serious large-scale effort is made, a huge amount of funds will naturally be needed, but this is not possible with the current financial resources. If it is transformed bit by bit, the effect will naturally be weak. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities are making efforts in the face of difficulties, such as the establishment of rural cooperatives, the establishment of rural loans, the establishment of agricultural schools, the improvement of silk and agricultural crops, and are doing their best. It is also reported that large-scale water conservancy projects will be carried out in the second phase of the Three-Year Plan, so it is expected that considerable success will be achieved in rural construction.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In recent years, Guangxi Province has made considerable progress in all aspects of construction. Chen Jitang, Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, has specially ordered his subordinates to organize an inspection delegation to Guangxi Province to conduct on-the-ground investigations of various undertakings for reference. He has designated Feng Zhuoxun, Chief of the Guard of the Guangdong Headquarters, as the team leader. As for the members, they will be senior officials sent by various agencies. In addition to several people sent by the headquarters, the Pacification Headquarters of the Eastern District, Southern District, Qiongyai District, Northwest District, and Central District, as well as the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education, will each send one person to jointly organize the delegation. The members of the delegation are ready to depart, awaiting Chen's scheduled convocation and briefing before setting off. The itinerary is to first go to Wuzhou, and then take a highway bus directly to Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, and visit Guilin, Bose, Liuzhou, and other counties for inspection on a daily basis. It has also been found that the Guangxi Provincial People's Militia is organized very comprehensively, equivalent to the Guangdong Provincial Guard, assisting the garrison in peacetime, searching and suppressing bandits with extraordinary effectiveness, and able to rise up to defend the territory and protect the locality in times of need. In order to make the Guangdong Provincial Guard a purely civilian military force, Chen has established an office to coordinate its management. Recently, he has divided the province into 16 guard inspection districts, each with an inspection commissioner to specialize in management. Seven commissioners have been appointed and transferred to a military and political school for a month of apprenticeship before being sent out to serve. In view of the considerable success of the Guangxi Provincial People's Militia, the inspection delegation has been ordered to pay special attention to this matter, so that it can be used as a reference when reviewing the second phase of the province's Three-Year Administration Plan. It is also found that the delegation can set off in three to four days and return to Guangdong to report in three weeks.</p>

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Recently, the provincial government has been very active in various construction undertakings, and has planned work on a monthly basis to proceed step by step. As for those to be undertaken this month, Provincial Government Chairman Yu instructed the Department of Construction to properly draft and submit them for review, and they have been implemented separately, including highways, water conservancy, and electricity, among other seven items, all of which are extremely important. The outline is as follows: (1) Highway aspect: Construct the Gansu-Qinghai-Taoqin Highway, measure the second main line of the Gansu-Sichuan Road, measure the main line of the Gansu-Xinjiang Road, construct the Qingshui-Zhangjiachuan branch road, and construct the Sijiahe Bridge in conjunction with Shaanxi Province; (2) Water conservancy aspect: Construct the Tao-Hui Canal, conduct an actual measurement of the Xingu City Canal, construct the Tiaocheng Yellow River dike project, and repair the Jingyuan Beihai River project; (3) Electricity aspect: Set up rural telephone networks in Qingyang, He, Huan, Ning, Zheng, and Jingchuan counties, and repair the Lanzhou electric light boiler; (4) Agricultural aspect: Distribute cotton seeds and promote cotton planting; (5) Forestry aspect: Universal afforestation and establishment of nurseries; (6) Measurements aspect: Promote measurement instruments. Chairman Yu of the Provincial Government stated that people in various counties often arbitrarily slaughter pregnant sheep and sell them on the market or eat them themselves, which affects the propagation of livestock. In order to prevent harm to livestock breeding, he has specifically formulated the "Measures for Punishing People in Gansu Province for Slaughtering Pregnant Sheep," consisting of seven articles, which have been promulgated and circulated to all county bureaus for compliance and prohibition.

<p>Lou Youzhong, a villager from the 9th Jia of the 6th Bao of Beicheng Township in the 5th District (Fengjing), had a hole dug in his wall on the night of the 13th of March, but the thieves escaped without any loss due to the victim's shouting. However, when Lou went to town to shop on the 18th, he met Zhang Zixian from the same village on the way to Dongzhakou. Zhang gave Lou a letter. As Lou could not read, he asked someone to open it. It turned out to be a threatening letter from the thieves, which roughly stated that seven people had hired a boat the previous night and lost ten yuan, eight jiao, and five fen. It instructed Lou to admit the loss and compensate for the loss, or they would be unfavorable to him. They would come to collect on the first day of the third lunar month. Lou was greatly alarmed and asked Jia Chang Lou Youxian to report it to the Second Sub-Bureau, which arrested Zhang Zixian. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 26th for interrogation.</p>

<p>Haizhou: Heavy Rains Cause Disaster and Another Year of Famine. Since last year's Yellow River flowed eastward and flooded, most farmers in the county were without clothes or food, and the disaster was severe, unprecedented in decades. When the Yellow River receded this spring, farmers borrowed high-interest loans and received government allocations for relief to sow spring wheat. Now that the wheat seedlings are growing, it has been raining heavily for several days, and the water level in the flat areas of the villages is more than a foot deep, submerging the wheat seedlings. This year's harvest is also hopeless, and farmers are generally worried.</p>

<h3 id="e89">South Shanghai Common Lantern Parade, All Sectors Enthusiastically Participate, Over 50,000 People, A Grand Occasion with Empty Streets <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Our city's municipal party headquarters, in order to assist the government in promoting the prohibition of opium and rejection of drugs, specially contacted various agencies and organizations to hold a week-long anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda week, which began on the 20th of this month and lasted until yesterday (the 26th). Yesterday was the last day. Simultaneous lantern parades were held in the evening at both South Shanghai and Pudong. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people participated in the group. Yesterday's lantern meeting in South Shanghai was attended by members of the Municipal Party Department, officials from the Municipal Government and various bureaus, officers from the Garrison Headquarters, police from the Public Security Bureau, the Boy Scout Council, Boy Scout troops, members of the Moral Improvement Society, the General Labor Union, and various labor union workers from the towing, candle, and postal industries, members of the Municipal Farmers' Association and various district farmers' associations, members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations from the medicine, cigarette, new medicine, glass, and military uniform industries, members of the Gong He Le Sports Association, lion dance troupes, martial arts groups, members of the Citizens' Federation, staff of the Da Zhonghua Hospital, staff of the Telegraph Bureau, representatives from the two road labor unions, staff of the Da Dong Sock Factory, members of the Fujianese Overseas Chinese Association with dragon lanterns and bands, the Ju Sheng He Sports Association lion dance troupe, the Guangdong East Club, staff from the Anti-Smoking Association, staff from the Anti-Drug Association, as well as city party members, students from both male and female, public and private, Shangzhong, Shanghai Women's High School, Kaiming, Jingye, Islamic, Youth Association, Dagong, Minguang, Minzu, Yongxing and other schools. The number of participants reached more than 50,000 people, creating a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>The colorful lanterns attract attention. The lanterns participating in the lantern parade are all bright and eye-catching, greatly attracting the attention of the audience. The dragon lanterns of the Fujianese Overseas Chinese Association, the lion dance troupe of Gong He Le, and the lion dance troupe of Ju Sheng He, as well as the stilts team of Fu Yu She, and the lanterns of the Postal Workers' Union, the Moral Improvement Society United Association, the Land Cargo Industry Association, the Towing Industry Association, the Cigarette Industry Association, the Ju Sheng He Sports Association, and the Candle Industry Association are all dazzling. The smoke couch lamp of the Gubei Church of the Moral Improvement Society, the Glass Industry Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the cars of the Health Bureau were all decorated with shocking and frightening smoke hazard lanterns, which were extremely moving. All the lanterns in this lantern parade have profound implications and are truly rare and valuable. Along the way, people shouted anti-smoking slogans and sang the party song. Although the weather was unfavorable in the middle of the journey, with wind and rain, the participants still reached the end point according to the scheduled route and dispersed.</p>
<p>Spectators line the streets along the route. The lantern parade departed from the Public Sports Ground, walked along Fangxie Road, passed the Old West Gate, turned south onto Zhonghua Road, passed the Little West Gate, the Great South Gate, the Little South Gate, the Great East Gate, the Little East Gate, walked along Minguo Road, passed the Xinkai River, the Xinbei Gate, the Old North Gate, the Little North Gate, Fangbang Bridge, the Old West Gate, and turned onto Heping Road to disband. Wherever it passed, it was crowded with spectators like entering a mountain or the sea. In order to prevent petty criminals from taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble, the Municipal Party Department specially notified the Municipal Security Committee to instruct the Bao members of the South Shanghai Regiment Guard teams to be fully on duty along the route of the lantern parade last night, so the order was quite good.</p>
<p>Pudong simultaneously holds a lantern parade. Various agencies and organizations in Pudong found it inconvenient to cross the river to participate in the lantern parade, and the area of Pudong is vast, so there should also be grand actions to attract the attention of Pudong citizens. Therefore, the Fifth District Party Department made preparations in advance and gathered thousands of people from various agencies and organizations at the vacant space of the Bing Tian Factory on Dongchang Road in Pudong at 6:00 pm last night to hold a lantern parade. The viewers blocked the road, which was quite eye-catching to the public.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau publishes notices to smokers. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to awaken smokers to register as soon as possible, specially printed a notice to smokers and distributed it along the way. The original text is as follows: (1) The valid period of the first-term limited smoking cessation permit has expired. Smokers who have obtained a permit should quickly go to the Public Security Bureau to exchange for the second-term limited smoking cessation permit. (2) Smokers who have failed to register should quickly go to the Public Security Bureau to complete the registration and apply for a limited smoking cessation permit. (3) The deadline for smokers to report is a total of three months. Those who do not register within the reporting period will be immediately sent to a smoking cessation hospital for treatment without spending a penny. (4) Those who smoke opium without obtaining a limited smoking cessation permit will be handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law if they are discovered by the Bureau after the deadline for smokers to report has passed.</p>

<p>The Central China Communications and other three banks, in order to meet the needs of Sichuan Province, decided to transport 10 million yuan of auxiliary coin notes to Sichuan for use. The Sichuan Province Post-Disaster Public Bonds were used to mortgage a 620,000 yuan disaster relief loan to the Central and other three banks, which has been signed. The details of each situation are recorded as follows: Ten million auxiliary coins are transported to Sichuan for adjustment. The finance of Sichuan Province, since being taken over by Hang Chen of the Central Government, has been actively reorganized. Liu Hangchen actively reorganized, and the Central Government allocated a loan of 12 million yuan to adjust Sichuan's financial situation, and after recovering the unredeemed remittance certificates and local banknotes issued by various banks and shops in Chongqing, the finance has been on track. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy on November 4 last year, the province's finance has become more stable. However, the amount of legal tender circulating in Sichuan Province is still insufficient, and Director Liu has often reported to Finance Minister Kong and requested that more legal tender be transported to Sichuan to facilitate turnover. The Ministry of Finance immediately ordered the Central and other three banks to transport 10 million yuan of auxiliary coins to Sichuan for use. The auxiliary coins are divided into 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao, with the Central Bank having the most. They have been transported from Shanghai to Chongqing by Minsheng Shipping. It is scheduled to transport 5 million yuan within the month, and the remaining 5 million yuan will be transported next month. Therefore, after Sichuan Province increases by 10 million auxiliary coins, the financial market can become more active.</p>
<p>The contract is signed, and a telegram is sent to Shanghai to release the funds. In order to handle disaster relief matters in Sichuan Province, Liu Hangchen, Director of the Department of Finance of Sichuan Province, came to Shanghai in mid-March to visit Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance and President of the Central Bank, and Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, etc., and agreed on the principle of mortgaging post-disaster public bonds to borrow funds, and then returned to Chongqing, and contacted various branches. After deliberation, it was agreed to mortgage 1 million yuan of post-disaster public bonds for a loan of 620,000 yuan, which would be jointly recognized by the Central China Chinese Farmers' Three Banks for 310,000 yuan, and the silver and money industry in Chongqing would jointly recognize 310,000 yuan, totaling 620,000 yuan. The contract was signed in Chongqing on the 25th. The Central China Chinese Farmers' and other sub-branches have all telegraphed Shanghai to report on the signing process and urge the release of funds. After receiving the telegram, the three banks decided to remit the funds to Chongqing within days and pay them to the Sichuan Finance Department to meet their needs.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Wusong Spring Fish on the Market, The First Batch of Three Fishing Boats Arrived in Wusong Yesterday, But All the Fish are Only for Local Entertainment <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The spring fishing season in Wusong, namely the Beiyang yellow croaker, had the first batch of three fishing boats arriving yesterday. The various situations are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Import situation. This year's spring fishing boats are quite numerous. However, due to the large wind and waves on the ocean surface, it is not easy to cast nets. Yesterday morning, the Gong He Shun, Jin Yuan Tai, and Jin Tong Zeng fishing boats successively imported. After inspection by the customs, they were unloaded ashore and sold by the joint office of the Cui Sheng, Shen Tai, and Guan Tai fish firms. The fixed price is 6 yuan and 6 jiao per 80 catties, and 14 catties of fish can be purchased per yuan. However, the goods that arrived yesterday can only be used for entertainment by local fish dealers. Therefore, local wholesale must wait for a large number of fishing boats to import.</p>
<p>Local Bureau Guarantee The various authorities pay great attention to the fishing season. In addition to issuing notices for protection, District Chief Dai Chenggong and Captain Wang Dingsheng from the Tax District sent teams to patrol the water surface. The Public Security Police Station added posts to maintain order on the Outer Bund.</p>
<p>Fish Firm Talk According to the person in charge of the fish firm, the fish market in Songdi has been declining year by year, and the business has decreased by two-thirds compared with the prosperous period in the past. Therefore, in recent years, the joint business of the three firms, including spring fish, turtle fish, and dried fish, has only about 200,000 yuan of business in total. The reason is that most fishing boats are sailing to Qingdao for sales. The salt price is cheaper in that place, and the transportation costs are reduced, so the fishing boats are turning north, which has greatly affected the Songdi fish firms.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Silver and Money Industry Tightens Lending Before the End of April, Deposits are Abundant, Foreign Interbank Lending Rates are Quietly Low, Preliminary Decision to Discuss Interest Rate Reduction in Early May <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The industry news agency said that before the end of the April settlement period, the silver and money industry in the city suddenly tightened lending, resulting in abundant deposits and low foreign interbank lending rates. The issue of interest rate reduction is scheduled to be discussed again in early May. The details are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tight Lending. The Banking Association and the Money Industry Association, in view of the fact that the Shanghai industrial and commercial industries in previous years have been in a slump due to the poor economic situation, rural bankruptcy, and weak purchasing power of the people, the economy has been deteriorating, so they have worked together to lend money for relief in order to revive the economy. However, by the end of April this year, it is actually difficult to fully recover the long-term loans granted to various industries, and there are quite a few who have declared liquidation and bankruptcy. In order to protect their own foundations, they unanimously implemented a tight policy before the end of April in order to maintain their business.</p>
<p>Low Foreign Interbank Lending Rates. In recent years, due to the sluggishness of various industries, the business of each money firm has also declined. Except for the Central China Communications Bank, whose business is growing day by day, the other commercial banks are not as good as before. Therefore, they are all extremely cautious about various loans, resulting in concentrated finance and no way out. During this annual extraordinary period at the end of April, the foreign interbank lending rate in the money industry market is still as low as 8%, which shows that the silver and money industry has sufficient preparations and can steadily weather the difficulties. However, the industrial and commercial industries have no access to loans, and the future is quite bleak.</p>
<p>Re-discuss Interest Rate Reduction. The Ministry of Finance previously approved the request of industry leaders in Shanghai and specially ordered the silver and money industries to formulate measures to reduce the interest rates on deposits and loans. After the two industries discussed and reported, the Ministry of Finance approved and ordered immediate reconsideration. According to news from the two industries yesterday, the Ministry of Finance could have agreed to the previous report, but due to the relationship of relieving the market, it had to order reconsideration. It is heard that the two industries will re-discuss interest rate reduction measures in early May and strive to realize them.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry Approves Trial Implementation of National Match Merchant Joint Venture and is Carefully Considering the Establishment of a Sino-Japanese Production and Sales Joint Venture.</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, in recent years, the establishment of match factories in our country has sprung up like mushrooms after rain, resulting in overproduction and slow sales. In order to develop the match business, limit the increase in production, and unify selling prices, the Shanghai China National Match Industry Association convened a general meeting of colleagues from factories across the country and resolved to organize a match joint venture to facilitate consolidation. A draft plan and articles of association have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The joint venture has been approved by the Ministry for a five-year trial period. During the trial period, the establishment of new factories and the increase in production by existing factories will be suspended in order to maintain the common prosperity of the domestic match industry. In addition to uniting domestic match manufacturers to promote development, negotiations are being conducted with Japanese merchants to establish a Sino-Japanese match industry production and sales joint venture. This is because smuggling has become rampant recently and cannot be stopped. A large amount of smuggled goods are sold in the country, and our match industry is facing a thorny situation. Therefore, repeated discussions have been held with the Japanese side, and opinions are gradually converging. The outline of the plan has now been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The Ministry considers this matter to be related to the progress of the domestic match industry and of great importance, and that it is an international commercial joint organization, and must be carefully examined.</p>

<p>Improved Sanitation Facilities on Two Railways.</p>
<p>Previously, the sanitary facilities of the passenger cars on the two railways, except for the first and second class cars, which were barely satisfactory, were extremely simple in the third and fourth class cars. Recently, Director Huang Boqiao has thoroughly reorganized the facilities and instructed the Songhu Second Factory to actively improve them. The first and first-class cars have become even more complete, and the third and fourth-class cars have also been equipped with sanitary ware made of enameled cast iron, greatly benefiting travelers.

<p>Three Robbers Disregard the Law: Daring to Rob in Broad Daylight. A Wealthy Couple Loses Five or Six Hundred Yuan. Woman Injured in the Abdomen for Refusing to Give Up Handbag.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a well-dressed and ornately adorned couple was riding in separate rickshaws near the Zhangjia Lane entrance in Xue Lane, downtown, when three or four robbers armed with pistols suddenly jumped out of the alley, ordering the rickshaw pullers to stop. One of the robbers pointed a pistol at the woman, warning her not to make a sound, while the other robbers stood guard outside the alley. The robbers took a gold bracelet from the woman's hand and hid it in their waistbands. However, the robbers' desires were not yet satisfied, and they wanted to take the handbag from the woman's hand as well. The husband, standing beside her, did not dare to speak and advised his wife to give up the handbag. But the woman insisted on refusing. The robbers, fearing that the delay would cause them to be discovered, quickly aimed their pistols at the woman's abdomen and fired a shot. The woman immediately fainted from the extreme pain, and the robbers grabbed the handbag and fled. The loss was five or six hundred yuan. Afterwards, her husband reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, requesting a strict investigation and arrest of the perpetrators, and sent his injured wife to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Gale in Shanghai Yesterday.</p>
<p>In recent days, the weather in Shanghai has been unstable, with alternating cold and warm temperatures, and changing between sunny and rainy conditions. Yesterday morning, a strong southeasterly wind suddenly arose and continued until the evening. Walking on the road, one was hit in the face with dust and sand, and the climate was extremely harsh. Although the whole day was clear and cold, it began to drizzle after nightfall. According to general predictions, an even greater storm may occur, so navigation should be careful.</p>
<p>Japanese Sailor Murder Case: First Special Court Opens Joint Session Today Out of Caution.范剛 Designated to Defend the Three Defendants, Ye, Yang, and Chen. Hearing May Not Prohibit Public Attendance This Afternoon.</p>
<p>Following the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Date Street, the Japanese Consulate General apprehended a Korean named Jack, while the Public Concession's Special Political Department also apprehended three Cantonese suspects, Ye Haisheng (also known as "Little Guangdong") and two Chens, in Qingdao and elsewhere, based on various leads. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for detention. The details have been reported in the press. It is learned that the case was continued on the morning of the 27th of this month at the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, presided over by Judge Xiao Xiefei. At that time, the Public Concession will file a public prosecution for murder. It has been discovered that, out of caution due to the complex and important nature of the case, the First Special Court has decided to form a joint panel to hear the case. The panel will be composed of Criminal Court President Qian Hongye and Judges Feng Shide and Xiao Xiefei. The hearing time has also been postponed to the afternoon. The hearing court may be changed to the First Criminal Court. The lawyer representing the Public Works Department in the prosecution has been designated as Ru Baoyi (the previous reports erroneously named Chiang Baolian). It is also said that the Procuratorate of the First Special Court will also appoint a prosecutor to appear in court to perform their duties. However, it is also necessary to continue to describe the process of arresting the perpetrators, so the record is being pursued.</p>
<p>After the murder occurred, the public security authorities of the Public Concession, and the Japanese military officers and police officers, recovered a PB-brand pistol about 90 yards from the scene of the incident, determining that it was the murder weapon used to shoot Nakayama Hideo. Based on this, an investigation was launched. A few days later, Deputy Inspector Nakamura Nagao of the Japanese Police Station received a report from Japanese detective Hairama Sugis that the murderers in the case were a Korean named Jack and two Chinese, one called "Little Guangdong," and one other unknown person. The pistol belonged to Jack. It was said that on the night of November 9th, Jack and "Little Guangdong" and two others, walking on Baole'an Road, happened to meet Nakayama. Near Fengle Village, Jack handed the pistol to "Little Guangdong," who then assassinated Nakayama. However, the three immediately fled after the incident, so their whereabouts were unknown. After receiving the news, Nakamura Nagao believed that the case had a lead and ordered Hairara to conduct further investigation. Soon, Nakamura received Hairala's second report, stating that it had been found that "Little Guangdong" was a member of the Triad society, familiar with a senior member of the society named Zeng Yuanchen. According to Zeng, in October of last year, "Little Guangdong" had pledged a pistol resembling a PB brand pistol to him, but he had refused due to lack of funds and returned the pistol. It was also learned that "Little Guangdong" had left Shanghai for Qingdao in November of last year, and then returned. In December of the same year, he took several dancing girls to Qingdao and opened the Vienna Dance Hall on Cangkou Road in Qingdao until February of this year, when he returned to Shanghai, went to the Yangzi Dance Hall for several days, and then left Shanghai for Qingdao again. After receiving this report, Nakamura Nagao instructed Haira to make a special appointment to meet with a member of the Triad, and put the PB brand pistol together with three other pistols for the Triad member to identify. The PB brand was pointed out, saying that it was what "Little Guangdong" had pledged to him. At this point, Nakamura believed that the leads were indeed close to the truth. On April 12th, he led several Japanese detectives and Zeng Yuanchen to Qingdao and went directly to the Vienna Dance Hall, where Zeng pointed out the appearance of "Little Guangdong". Zeng Yuanchen only knew that "Little Guangdong"'s surname was Ye, but did not know his name. After Nakamura Nagao returned to Shanghai, on April 14th, he requested the Legal Group of the Public Works Department to request a public letter from the First Special District Court to transfer the prisoner, stating that there was a murderer named Ye, nicknamed "Little Guangdong," who had been detained in Qingdao. Due to the request of the Legal Group of the Public Works Department, the court issued a public letter to transfer the prisoner on the same day. Nakamura Nagao, holding this public letter, led several Japanese detectives and flew to Qingdao on April 15th. The director of the Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau, after reviewing the public letter submitted by Nakamura Nagao, was deeply shocked because the bureau had not detained a prisoner named Ye, so how could there be a public letter to transfer him? Nakamura Nagao then stated to the bureau that the prisoner Ye had not been detained and requested assistance in the arrest. The director of the bureau believed that the procedure was not appropriate and that the public letter to transfer could not be used as an arrest warrant. Later, Nakamura Nagao used other procedures to finally arrest "Little Guangdong" and escort him to Shanghai. This is the process of "Little Guangdong" being arrested. This "Little Guangdong" is Ye Haisheng, about 28 or 29 years old. On April 19th, the Detewe Road Police Station requested the First Special District Court to issue two search warrants, one for No. 36 in a certain village on Oujia Road and one for a certain village on Tangshan Road, saying that wanted criminals were hiding at the above two locations. The court issued the search warrants on the same day. The Detewe Road Police Station sent several Japanese detectives to search Oujia Road first, but found nothing. Then they went to Tangshan Road to search. In a certain house number, they found an English physics book. The book was hardcover, with a hole dug inside, the size of which was similar to that of a BP brand pistol. One side of the book resembled an imprint of the characters BP. The owner of the house was named Yang Wendao, about 40 years old, from Guangdong. Yang was the president of the Shanghai Compatriots Association, which had a certificate of registration approved by the authorities. Therefore, Yang was arrested. Also arrested was Chen Rongsheng, a Cantonese man in his thirties, who was a member of the Compatriots Association because he had close dealings with Yang. This is the story of how Yang and Chen were arrested. Yang and Chen were sent to the First Special Court on the afternoon of April 20th to apply for detention. "Little Guangdong" Ye Haisheng applied for detention on April 21st. All are now held in special rooms in the Central Police Station.</p>
<p>During the investigation, Yang Wendao admitted that he had once possessed a BP brand pistol, but that the gun had been lost for more than a year. Yang also admitted that the English quantity study book belonged to him, but he firmly denied any knowledge of the Nakayama Hideo murder case. Chen Rongsheng absolutely denied any connection with the Nakayama Hideo case. "Little Guangdong" Ye Haisheng confessed that the reason he was poor in the past and now has money is that his wife, Chen Guizhen, is a dancer detained in the Public Security Bureau. After leaving the dance hall a few years ago, Guizhen entered the dance hall and met a wealthy merchant surnamed Wang. Last year, Wang died of illness and Guizhen inherited the estate. Guizhen reunited with him last year, so he now has the capital to open a dance hall, not from murder. He denied the murder. The police department now recognizes "Little Guangdong" Ye Haisheng as the prime culprit in the Nakayama Hideo case, Yang Wendao as the instigator, Chen Rongsheng as having a lesser relationship, and the Korean Jack as the principal offender, and believes that the case does not have political implications. It is said that Haisheng also confessed that although he knew the Korean Jack, he had fought with him because of a loan dispute. Ye and Yang Chen both denied knowing Zeng Yuanchen. According to those close to the Legal Group of the Public Works Department, the Legal Group analyzed the Yang Chen Ye suspects from a legal perspective, and the evidence of the crime was insufficient. The court considered the case to be serious and decided to hold a joint hearing on April 27th (i.e. today) at about 2:00 PM, presided over by Criminal Court President Qian Hongye and judges Feng Shide and Xiao Xiefei. According to news from the Fan Gang Law Office, the court designated lawyers such as Fan to provide pro bono defense for Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and Chen Rongsheng. It is said that the hearing may not prohibit public attendance.</p>
<p>Public Works Department and Rickshaw Dealers: Meeting Next Week to Resolve All Outstanding Issues.</p>
<p>Regarding the rickshaw dispute in the Public Concession, a temporary end has been reached. However, in order to resolve all outstanding issues, it is necessary for the Public Works Department to continue negotiations with the rickshaw dealers. According to news from the B side of the Public Works Department, the negotiations have recently been scheduled to be held at the Public Works Department next Thursday, April 30, at 9:45 AM.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Chinese Antiques Postponed to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The British postal ship Lanpo Lai, after running aground off Gibraltar and being rescued, has arrived in Marseille, France. The antiques on board have not been removed. The other day, Shanghai received a telegram stating that the British mail to Shanghai on the Lanpo Lai, along with some passengers, did not have time to wait long and had transferred to the Australian postal ship Borrabool, which will arrive in Colombo, Ceylon, to transfer to the Far East liner Soudan to Shanghai, which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 15th. The exhibition of Chinese antiques will have to be postponed to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jinlong Silk Weaving Factory: Lawsuit After Closure Awaits Investigation.</p>
<p>Qian Qizong and Jiang Linshu, currently managers of the Dalun Silk Fabric Bureau on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, and Jiang Changlin, who currently resides at No. 5, Lane 473, Aivin Yi Road, jointly established the Jinlong Silk Weaving Factory in 1931, with a total capital of 24,000 yuan. Jiang held half of the shares, and the rest was raised by Qian and others. After starting the business, unexpectedly, the losses were very large, and it was soon closed down. Jiang appointed accountant Wang Zikang to review the accounts and discovered many irregularities. Jiang had no choice but to hire lawyer Ge Zhaoji to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Qian Qizong, Jiang Linshu, Pan Shenchu, Qian Yaozhen, and four others of fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and other crimes. The other day was the date for the continuation of the trial. According to the plaintiff Jiang Changlin, he and Qian and others jointly formed the Jinlong Silk Weaving Factory in 1931, with an authorized capital of 24,000 yuan, agreed to be a limited liability company, appointed Qian Qizong as supervisor, Jiang Linshu as supervisor, in charge of money in and out, and Pan Shenchu as manager, specializing in factory scheduling. Who knew that after each person took office, until the business closed, they not only did not perform their duties, but also committed illegal acts. When Qian Yaozhen, the manager of the Yongfeng Silk Village, signed a contract with the Jinlong Silk Factory, he and Qian, Jiang, and others colluded in fraud, so he was also listed as a defendant. As for the facts of each person's crime, the first was erosion of capital. The capital of the Jinlong Silk Weaving Factory was calculated at 24,000 yuan, and the plaintiff recognized half of the shares, a total of six shares, totaling 12,000 yuan. However, the capital book only recorded the receipt of 6,000 yuan from the plaintiff. The report of accountant Pan Xulun also showed the same, a difference of half the amount. Qian and Jiang held important positions and were in charge of money in and out, but they did not record the plaintiff's remaining half of the shares in the register, and their responsibility for embezzlement was undeniable. The second was dereliction of duty and fraud. The Jinlong Factory's general ledger recorded the payment of 800 yuan in expenses to a certain bureau on May 24, 1934, 50 yuan to a certain bureau, and 20 yuan in clothing materials to a certain bureau. If the above three items were true, then Qian and Jiang committed bribery under Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. If they were false, then it was an overpayment and close to pocketing the funds, violating Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for fraud. In the middle, there was also a record of four payments of 2,800 yuan in remuneration to Qian Shaoji. It was absurd that the business was not doing well and the company was heavily in debt, so how could there be any remuneration? Moreover, there was no such person as Qian Shaoji among the staff, so it was known that they colluded to commit fraud. As for Pan Shenchu, there was suspicion of perjury, because Pan testified in the civil court of the First Special District that the Jinlong Factory's liquidation expenses at the time were six or seven thousand yuan, which Pan borrowed from the Yongfeng Silk Village, but this was a false statement intended to make the plaintiff bear an unrequired debt, so he was accused of perjury. Qian Yaozhen was the manager of the Yongfeng Silk Village and the brother of Qian Qizong. The actual number of products in stock at the Jinlong Factory was more than 25,000 yuan. According to the contract with Yongfeng, the mortgage ratio was limited to 70%, so Yongfeng only needed to advance more than 17,000 yuan. Now, Qian Yaozhen of the Yongfeng Silk Village has advanced funds exceeding the fixed amount, reaching 35,000 yuan, which not only violated the contract but was actually colluding with his brothers Qian Qizong and Jiang Linshu to commit fraud. Furthermore, the contract stated that the Yongfeng Silk Village should collect and remit the funds for the goods sold by the Jinlong Factory at any time. However, in 1933, the Yongfeng sold Jinlong goods worth more than 178,000 yuan, which should have been transferred at any time, but the village delayed the transfer until February 1934, causing the Jinlong to lose more than 12,000 yuan in interest. Thus, Qian Yaozhen of the Yongfeng Village fraudulently obtained illegal interest and betrayed others, violating the crime of fraud and breach of trust under the Criminal Law and attaching a private prosecution, seeking compensation for losses totaling 63,700 yuan. Subsequently, the defendant Qian Qizong replied that the reason for the underreporting of the capital at the time was to avoid the attention of the workers, so it was recorded in the books at half the amount, with no intention of embezzlement. As for the payment to a certain bureau, it was handled by another person and was of a nature similar to remuneration. As for the reason for the total transfer of business income, it was because the entire year's business was not in cash until the end of the year, when it was collected, so it was transferred once at the end of the final settlement. As for the remuneration to Qian Shaoji, it was all with the consent of the plaintiff. Then, the plaintiff questioned the defendant in court, asking whether the remuneration was cash or gifts. The defendant replied that it was a gift certificate. When asked which store's gift certificate, he replied that it was the Bank of China or the Shanghai Bank, but he could not remember. Later, accountant Wang Zikang confirmed to the court the discrepancies in the Jinlong Factory's various account books. The court then adjourned the case to 2:00 PM on the 29th for further questioning due to the need to summon witnesses and conduct investigations.</p>
<p>A Suicide Note Exhausts a Lifetime of Pain. Min Shanbao's Suicide by Drowning is Pitiable. Yang Shenzhi's Abandonment Cannot Escape the Law. - A Letter to the Fellow Workers' Auxiliary Yuantang Requesting Public Announcement -</p>
<p>The other day, the Fellow Workers' Auxiliary Yuantang branch on Ningbo Road in the French Concession received a strange letter delivered by mail. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Uncle Jingru, My pitiful self, unfortunately, my father passed away from illness when I was only three years old. My mother and I were left alone and helpless. Later, I was pitied by an elder, who gave us a monthly living allowance of 12 yuan, which was enough to keep us warm and fed. In 1925, my cousin, Yang Shenzhi, who worked at the Zhengda Xiang store at Dadongmen, saw that my mother was living alone and pretended to be solicitous. Soon, he seduced her and they began living together in a rented house in Juxin Village, Nanshi. At that time, I was still unaware of such matters. In 1926, Shenzhi resigned for some reason. Later, through the introduction of his sister, he became an employee of the Guanshengyuan General Company, and is now responsible for collecting accounts for the company. In 1927, Shenzhi returned to his hometown to get married. In the winter of that year, my mother gave birth to a son, named Quansheng, who is now nine years old. Shenzhi loves him as the apple of his eye. At that time, I was slightly aware of such matters, and entered primary school for two years. Later, I transferred to the Ai Qun Girls' School.</p>
<p>Time flies, and years pass quickly. Then, the Shanghai War broke out, and the elder's living allowance suddenly stopped, leaving me unable to continue my studies. I dropped out of school and returned home to help my mother with household chores. Who knew that the 128 Disaster Star arrived? In the winter of that year, Shenzhi saw that I was becoming more attractive and my affections were beginning to blossom. He gradually began to harbor inappropriate thoughts, and often</p>

<p>Economic Supplement: Finance in Extraordinary Times by Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Taxes? Public Debt?</p>
<p>During the European War, the policy issues regarding how various countries raised funds for war expenses sparked widespread debate. The unfolding war situation, the ever-increasing demand for war funds, and the urgency of time constraints deeply concerned the financial authorities of various countries. The expenditures for years of war preparation, the detrimental effects of capital accumulation, and ordinary financial problems were already pressing matters, let alone the extraordinary times and the extraordinary demands they brought!</p>
<p>In ancient and medieval times, war expenses were mostly paid from accumulated reserves in peacetime, supplemented by tax levies and requisitions. Victors could also use spoils of war and reparations to make up for the expenses. Later, with the development of public credit, especially after the mid-eighteenth century, public debt gradually replaced the position of accumulated reserves. At this time, the purpose of taxation was only to provide funds for paying debt interest or as a debt repayment fund.</p>
<p>However, while the issuance of public debt can quickly raise a significant amount of revenue, it inherently has the disadvantage of inflating credit. Moreover, purchasing public debt is equivalent to investment. Marx said that this is a method for the bourgeoisie to accumulate capital, which is indeed a profound insight. Therefore, if wartime finance relies on public debt, on one hand, a vast number of hard-working people are shedding blood on the front lines, sacrificing themselves for the country, or tightening their belts in the rear, working diligently. On the other hand, a small number of bourgeois individuals are sitting back and enjoying huge profits in the rear, taking the opportunity to get rich. Once the war ends, ordinary people may have no choice but to pay heavy taxes to repay the national debt. This phenomenon is most likely to arouse dissatisfaction and create a trend of social unrest. Therefore, the bourgeoisie also feels that the issue is serious and cannot be treated casually. Thus, whether war expenses should be covered by public debt or by taxation has become the center of controversy.</p>
<p>Seligman, Plehn, and others advocated that wartime expenditures should be solely financed by public debt. This is because public debt places the burden on the future, while also reducing the direct pain of increased taxes for the people during wartime. It can also avoid the adverse effects of tax pressure on wartime industry and commerce, enabling them to continuously supply the resources needed for the war. Moreover, the governments of Germany and France believed that public debt was not the ultimate burden on the people and could easily be recovered from the enemy in the future. Therefore, the means of raising war funds almost entirely relied on public debt. The war debt raised by Germany accounted for a staggering 104.4% of the total war expenses. The proportion of war debt raised by France also reached 100.3% of the total war expenses. This situation not only indicates that their entire war expenses were reliant on public debt, but also indicates that some other expenses were also paid for by public debt. However, as a result, Germany was defeated and not only failed to recover from the enemy, but also had to be extorted for huge reparations. The national credit completely collapsed. France, on the other hand, forcibly demanded reparations, not hesitating to use force as a backing. Therefore, although the war has ended, the disputes still exist, and military expenditures continue to increase. Domestically, there is also a public opinion that demands reparations and opposes taxes, plunging public finances into extreme chaos.</p>
<p>Pigou of the United Kingdom, Sprague and Durant of the United States, and others believed that war expenses should be met with taxation. This is because taxation can prevent credit inflation from disrupting the social economy, avoid unequal distribution of the burden of war expenses, and avoid disrupting the financial system. This view is originally of great value. However, the essential requirements of wartime finance are rapid revenue and a large amount of funds. Taxation is relatively difficult. Therefore, looking at the results of tax revenue in various countries during the European War, the ratio to war expenses is generally very low. The tax revenue performance of the United Kingdom was better, but in the first year of the war, it was only 7%. Although it increased later, the overall average was still only 20%. On the other hand, those reliant on public debt accounted for 75.3%. Although the tax revenue performance of the United States was even better, at 31.7%, the ratio of national debt to the general total war expenses still accounted for 80.6%. As for other countries, the taxes levied by France during the war were not even enough to cover ordinary recurring expenses in peacetime; the new tax revenues of Italy were only sufficient to pay the interest on war debts. Germany could not even pay the interest, and the situation was similar in other countries.</p>
<p>Some people argue that war expenses should be entirely maintained by taxation, so as not to disrupt finance and avoid credit inflation. However, during the transitional period before new taxes become abundant, temporary borrowing can be used to cope with the situation. This method is generally recognized by the public in principle and is also adopted by the authorities of various countries in practice. However, as the war prolonged, the borrowing policy had to continue to be used. As a result, the desire to have limited inflation was still practically impossible to achieve. As can be seen from the active adoption of tax policies by the United Kingdom and the United States during the European War.</p>
<p>There were also a few British people who advocated establishing a type of permanent tax (Limpot Dermant) to maintain all public expenditures during and after the war. This stems from the argument for a military tax system and is a policy adorned with militaristic ideology. However, given the existence of the capital accumulation process in capitalist society, there is no hope that any tax can have such broad flexibility.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the United States' participation in the war, Treasury Secretary McAdoo advocated that war expenses should be equally distributed between taxes and public debt. In other words, half of the war expenses should be covered by tax revenue, and half by public debt revenue.</p>
<p>However, it is practically impossible to maintain this balanced limit. The reason is the same as the impossibility of the third proposition. Therefore, in the McAdoo era, in the 1917 fiscal year, expenses paid by tax revenue accounted for about 55%, but by 1918—the year after entering the war—the proportion of tax revenue had slowed down to 31.6%.</p>
<p>Before the end of the war, some people in France argued that all recurring expenses should be covered by tax revenue, while military expenses and pensions should be covered by public debt.</p>
<p>This budgetary division is not a good policy in terms of the financial system; moreover, is its actual effect not just increasing taxes on one hand and borrowing on the other?</p>
<p>Originally, these issues vary depending on the environment and actual situation of each country. For example, France was invaded by the enemy after the war broke out, and although the invaded area was not large, it was an economically important region. Therefore, its tax base naturally caused panic. At the same time, there was a considerable number of rentier classes in its social strata. Therefore, the complete reliance on public debt could represent the forces behind their government. As for Germany, it was originally the most rampant militaristic country. It held a determined belief in victory in the last war. Therefore, raising public debt was akin to giving the people a guaranteed investment. As for the United States, it had already invested a lot in war bonds to the Allied countries, so it wanted to extract its domestic financial burden from the general public. This precisely demonstrates the true nature of a rising capitalist country. As for the United Kingdom, because its tax system was more sound than other countries, its society's taxable capacity also had great flexibility. The proposition of relying on taxation was not a mere fantasy.</p>
<p>Domestic View Exploration</p>
<p>Now, we are also forced to study these issues. However, putting aside all vested interests, speaking only from the perspective of practical ability: then, wanting to increase taxes, the usual donations and taxes have already overwhelmed the people; issuing public debt, the society's surplus funds, even if pouring out all its possessions, it is unknown how many days of war expenses can be maintained? Because, our people's income is much lower than others; our society's surplus funds are much less than others; our tax system is unsound; and our credit institutions are not modernized. All this demonstrates that our country's wartime resources are extremely empty; our country's financial elasticity is pitifully weak. Even the peacetime financial budget is still precarious and mortgaging the future; let alone encountering this extraordinary demand. Therefore, although there are many opinions expressed by both the government and the public regarding this issue, everyone does not have a proper solution. Therefore, everyone's attitude is almost uniformly holding to "[regardless of the type of financial resources, as long as there is some revenue: regardless of the amount, regardless of the interests, only taking is the goal]." For example:</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu and others advocated using income tax as the main source of revenue, and if necessary, implementing a limited paper currency policy, and issuing a small amount of public debt to supplement it.</p>
<p>Zhu Guangze and others have the same opinion.</p>
<p>Income tax is indeed one of the best tax systems. But the problem is that the income of most people is minimal, how much can be available for national use? Since the main revenue does not have much hope, wanting to implement a limited paper currency policy, the result is only unlimited expansion. Wanting to issue a limited amount of public debt, the result can only be unlimited issuance. Therefore, although the theory is extremely in line with financial principles, the effect has no choice but to go down a path against one's will. In the future, it will only have to rely on dangerous paper currency policies and public debt policies from beginning to end. The so-called "income tax as the main source of revenue" is "drawing a cake to satisfy hunger," as Xiao Shuyu said, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>War expenses should be maintained simultaneously by increased taxes and borrowing. And bonds should be both domestic and foreign. As for paper currency policies, they are absolutely opposed. This is the proposition of Wei Tingsheng and others.</p>
<p>There is also someone who almost entirely copied Wei's book "Wartime Finance" in the Economic Quarterly and echoed it.</p>
<p>However, if increased taxes and borrowing do not have other prerequisites and appropriate preparations, as a result, on the one hand, there will be heavy and tyrannical levies, the people cannot bear it; and the revenue is still insignificant; on the other hand, credit inflation still forms a world of paper currency overflow. The lessons learned by various countries during the European War are.</p>
<p>Zhu Xi believed that the way out for China's wartime finance should start from those with the ability to bear the burden, but who have no direct burden on the country. His goal is to implement: municipal land value tax, land appreciation tax; and bank income tax. However, this income is extremely limited, and Zhu is well aware of it. Therefore, he also proposed ten fundamental measures: preparing war special profit tax, preparing entertainment tax, increasing the tax rate on luxury goods, increasing stamp duty, increasing postage, allocating according to property, implementing saving the country donation, free donation, borrowing foreign debt, implementing paper currency policies when necessary, and reducing unnecessary expenditures. Two Two, however, the tax revenue part is all small in income and will greatly disturb the people. The part on soliciting donations is either not easy to handle and has little effect (free donation), or has a great effect but is difficult to handle (saving the country donation). As for raising foreign debt, where the creditor is is the first problem; paper currency policies are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>I believe that wartime tax policies should also adhere to the principles of "avoiding harshness and detail" and "minimum sacrifice." Public debt and paper currency are both extremely dangerous policies, but even countries as wealthy and strong as European and American countries cannot avoid them, let alone our country. However, how to reduce the danger, how to make it safe and fair, is the main issue. In short, the attitude we must adhere to in raising war funds is: "How to quickly concentrate a large amount of funds within the possible scope and safe limits to meet the needs of the war; and also have the ability to sustain it for a long time. All that is sought is quick results, using any means, this is not a solution after all. If one drinks poison to quench thirst and acts rashly, then the danger may be the same as war. Because to ensure victory in the war, one must have manpower (Mau), material resources (Munton), and financial resources (Money), and none of them can be lacking.</p>
<p>Wartime financial policy, if it can obtain a large amount of revenue, has already fulfilled its responsibility to the war. But if it incites social unrest due to unscrupulous means, losing the conditions of "unity against foreign enemies" and "determination to fight" in "manpower," the result will be that even if it is not defeated by the war, it will be defeated by finance. "What defeated Germany was not the war, but the revolutionary sentiment in the army." The financial authorities should pay close attention to this famous saying.</p>
<p>What the war machine truly needs is not currency, but material resources. Material resources can be continuously supplied for war use only under continuous and smooth production. War has already given production great resistance. If finance puts another pressure on it, this is a self-destructive approach. Tax policies and public debt policies are both like double-edged swords to production. On the one hand, they can help it remove thorns, and on the other hand, they can take its life. It all depends on how they are used.</p>
<p>Currency is only an intermediary for making war obtain the necessary material resources; it is not the main purpose of wartime finance. As long as credit institutions are sound and the means of implementation are appropriate, it can be solved. Therefore, our economic capacity does not allow us to choose wartime financial resources as scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States do, should war expenses be paid by taxes? Or should war expenses be paid by public debt? And so on this simple question. Because of our scarce resources, absorbing from multiple sources is good, and it is also necessary. What we are concerned about is what methods can be used to avoid various potential dangers and be within "safe limits." However, the general public always regards paper currency policies as a last resort. Therefore, this article will temporarily leave this issue aside and focus on discussing what policies we should adopt for taxation and public debt during wartime.</p>
<p>Wartime Tax Policies</p>
<p>Now, let's first discuss wartime tax policies.</p>
<p>There are four significant advantages to implementing tax policies during wartime:</p>
<p>In terms of prices: Although indirect taxes can raise prices due to transfer, their power is less than that of credit inflation. (However, avoiding them is the best policy) Direct taxes are mostly non-transferable, so they have no impact on prices. Prices do not skyrocket (during wartime, price increases are always unavoidable due to increased demand and unavoidable credit inflation). On the one hand, people's hearts are more stable, and livelihoods are easier; on the other hand, wartime industries can also proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>In terms of material resources: Reducing consumption for war use is one of the real resources during wartime.</p>
<p>Increasing taxes results in the invisible restriction of people's consumption. Beneficial to the war.</p>
<p>In terms of finance: Public debt is actually future taxes; and in order to show national credit, when borrowing, new taxes are set up or tax rates are increased as funds for repayment of principal and interest. Therefore, in finance, it is just drinking poison to quench thirst, increasing the burden. Taxes unconditionally seize a portion of the national income. Therefore, the government does not increase the burden; for the people, it is actually equivalent to reducing the burden of public debt interest.</p>
<p>In terms of society: Debt is easy to arouse social injustice; the burden of the tax system, as long as it conforms to the principle of equal sacrifice, can gain the support of the majority of the people; even those who have resentment are only a small portion of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, it is not enough to affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>However, taxes also have two major shortcomings:</p>
<p>Raising taxes is slow to take effect, which is not in line with the urgent needs of wartime.</p>
<p>The burden of taxes is added to the present. Therefore, it is a restriction on national income: revenue is difficult to be abundant. If the tax system is poor, it is especially easy to arouse social unrest, and reduce the social economic production capacity.</p>
<p>This is from the perspective of tax theory. As for based on our country's actual situation, there are more reasons why tax policy is not enough to solve the entire war expense problem. The main ones are:</p>
<p>The places with greater national income, that is, places with more tax revenue, must be cities with developed production industries. Our country's largest cities, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuxi, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Ningbo, Hangzhou, etc., are either along the coast or along the river, and some have already fallen under the enemy's power, and some are also places that the enemy is preparing to seize. Therefore, once the war occurs, the above-mentioned places all have the possibility of being successively occupied by the enemy. Therefore, the existing three major sources of salt, tariffs, and customs are no longer ours; let alone being able to dig up other new tax sources.</p>
<p>Our country's production is backward, and national income is extremely low. As far as the current situation is concerned, in addition to paying taxes, livelihoods have become a problem.</p>
<p>The impact of social and economic panic in recent years, all industries have declined; especially the rural economy is even more miserable.</p>
<p>Tax resources are distributed throughout the country: In our country with a corrupt and unbearable collection system, even in peacetime, it is not possible to achieve public good with every bit of revenue. If there is no strict supervision, the wartime situation will be even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Economic separatism formed by political separatism is currently rampant in provinces with expanding feudal forces. Therefore, interception and tax withholding have not yet disappeared. Although this is a political issue and has to be put aside, it cannot be excluded from our considerations.</p>
<p>Therefore, our wartime tax policy, in addition to political issues that need to be resolved with political methods, from a financial standpoint: one party should do its best to give play to its advantages: under this purpose, we must first cultivate the foundation of national resources. What the war needs is material resources, and what the people need is "income." The only means to obtain this effect is to increase production. Therefore, Pigou believes that increasing production is one of the main resources during wartime.</p>
<p>In our country, where production is backward and declining, in this extraordinary period, we must implement national defense economic construction. The source of construction funds should come from expanding credit.</p>
<p>Because its production has a price, it should be obtained from public debt with investment properties. It can avoid the burden of increased taxes on the general public in addition to being oppressed by profits. At the same time, this type of credit inflation has no drawbacks. The prices raised by inflation are still suppressed by increased production.</p>
<p>On the other hand: we should try our best to avoid its shortcomings. Under this purpose, we should earnestly base ourselves on the principles of "minimum sacrifice" and "equal sacrifice." These two principles are not mutually opposed. The former is to make the people bear the amount of the "minimum sacrifice"; the latter is to make the distribution of the people's burden conform to the substantial "equality of sacrifice." Therefore, this "equality" is not an equal division of the burden, nor is it a proportional burden, but a progressive grant to various classes with substantial equality in sacrifice, so that the tax system can play the role of adjusting distribution in order to avoid its shortcomings as much as possible.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned principles and special circumstances, we propose the following for tax policies and related policies:</p>
<p>Implement a progressive income tax, inheritance tax, wealth tax, and excess profits tax (including land appreciation tax, wartime excess profits tax, excessive profits, etc.) that are more emphasized than in peacetime. As for luxury tax and entertainment tax, they have long lost their qualification as my source under wartime consumption control; therefore, there is no need to increase the tax rate further, but given our country's special circumstances, there may be a possibility of appropriately increasing them.</p>
<p>Improve the collection system, strictly supervise management; both physical objects and currency should be used for collection methods. For example, agricultural tax, sales tax related to war use, sales tax related to monopoly, etc., can all adopt the physical object collection system, while income tax, inheritance tax, wealth tax, excess profits tax, etc., can still use the currency collection system depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>The main advantages of adopting the physical object collection system are four: (A) the income can be directly used for war use and public sales, (B) it can help the implementation of wartime price control policies, (C) it can reduce the opportunity for tax officials to embezzle and make personal gains, because it is more difficult to embezzle physical objects than to embezzle currency. (D) it can avoid producers from being oppressed and exploited by commercial capital. However, there is also one shortcoming: (A) collection fees may increase, (B) storage and collection procedures are more complicated, (C) transportation is time-consuming, but these shortcomings are not difficult to prevent: (A) implement physical object exchange, (B) nationalize transportation, (C) implement price control, (D) establish state-managed commercial centers. Detailed methods will be discussed in a special article.</p>
<p>Appropriately adopt the tax farming system. In order to cope with the urgent expenditures during wartime, the tax farming system can be adopted for taxes with slow collection. However, its drawbacks can easily lead to tax farmers using their power to harass the people. Therefore, it may be better to organize a tax company run by merchants and supervised by officials. In addition to contracting tax collection, it can also underwrite treasury bills. The establishment of the tax farming system can reduce the tax collection expenses. The amount of this reduction can be used as the maximum limit for contracting profits, which seems more appropriate.</p>
<p>Register luxury goods such as gold, silver, jewelry, ornaments, works of art, antiques, etc. Implement requisition, confiscation, or purchase when necessary. This income is used as a part of offsetting the price of international lending. I firmly believe that if it can be handled properly, the amount of income will be considerable. However, it only has practical value before the external transportation and communication in Shanghai are cut off, and this disturbance will inevitably be unbearable.</p>
<p>Implement a large-scale public sales policy to offset the losses of salt tax, consolidated tax, and customs duties affected by the war. Such as table salt, kerosene, coal, matches, tea, silk, sugar, tung oil, tobacco, alcohol, and even cotton, wheat, etc. Except for the four types of table salt, tobacco, alcohol, and matches, others are all those that have significant relationships with international trade. Therefore, they should also be uniformly listed as commodities for public sale. As for the production and consumption of tobacco and alcohol, they should be vigorously banned or restricted during wartime. In order to divert this consumer capital for wartime resources. Therefore, it has already lost its value for public sale. However, it should still be listed as a commodity for public sale.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the implementation of the above-mentioned plans and to adapt to the extraordinary state of the wartime economy, a wartime economic control policy should be implemented immediately and engage in national defense economic construction. These funds are raised by expanding government credit.</p>
<p>Because of the effect of economic construction, material production can be increased, national income can be improved, and society will enter prosperity, and wartime resources can be inexhaustible. Thus, on the one hand, most of the material resources needed for the war can be self-sufficient; and the ability to resist economic blockade can be slightly increased. On the other hand: the public expenditures, of which those that are consumptive (such as those transferred to foreigners due to contractual relationships) can be gradually reduced; and those that are transferable (those transferred to domestic people due to contractual or obligation relationships) can be increased day by day; so that social resources can flow in a smooth state.</p>
<p>In addition, forced donations and requisitions can also be done occasionally; however, postal surcharges, stamp duty rate increases, and business tax rate increases, etc., should be avoided as appropriate. One reason is that the income is not large, the second reason is that it can be transferred, and the third reason is that it forms a multiple tax with the above-mentioned newly levied and heavily levied taxes. They will all severely harm people's livelihood. When creating new taxes or adding new tax rates, we should vigorously strike at the production of wartime industries. Otherwise, it will be a loss outweighing the gain.</p>
<p>Wartime Public Debt Policy</p>
<p>Next, we can discuss our wartime public debt policy.</p>
<p>The raising of war expenses takes "rapid" and "huge amount" as two major requirements. Countries that do not have war preparation savings have no other way to cope with emergency expenditures during wartime other than public debt. Countries with strong taxable capacity still cannot rely entirely on taxation for war expenses in the future. Not to mention those with weak taxable capacity. Therefore, this is a matter of fact; what is worth discussing is only how to make it safe.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, public debt policy contains great dangers. The main ones are: First, it forms credit inflation, resulting in inflation. Second, it increases the financial burden, making finance a private distribution administration for creditors; third, it increases the inappropriate burden on the principal and interest of public debt for the people; fourth, it increases the process of capital concentration and accumulation, and emphasizes inequality in social distribution; fifth, it violates the principle of "equal sacrifice" in finance.</p>
<p>However: on the one hand, there is an inevitable trend to issue public debt for compensation; on the other hand, there is a contradiction of causing social and economic unrest; we cannot stop eating because we are afraid of choking, and we cannot drink poison to quench our thirst; the only way is to seek a way out within a relatively safe limit.</p>
<p>Regarding the "safe limit" of public debt policy, I believe that the following four major conditions must be met:</p>
<p>First, the issuance of credit has the ability to automatically regulate; it will not disrupt finance and affect prices. For example, if the funds for public enterprise come from credit, there is this possibility of automatic regulation. Such as foreign debt, although it has no regulatory power, it also has no destructive power.</p>
<p>Second, slow down the process of capital accumulation and concentration. This is important, but it is impossible to turn the social system upside down. Therefore, at present, we can only say "slow down." I believe that during wartime, one should not adopt high interest rates, tax exemptions, etc. to induce the sale of public debt. This is not only harmful to finance itself, but also not really necessary, because during wartime, it is safer for people to purchase and store public debt than to store currency. An appropriate publicity campaign can also arouse the people's patriotism to help the issuance of public debt. Tax exemption for public debt is truly an enemy of the wealth tax system. It is not allowed at any time. In addition, I believe that in the period of financial consolidation after the war, in order to reduce the financial burden, a special debt redemption levy should be created. According to the people's ability to pay taxes, it should be levied on individual net worth (referring to capital rather than income) on a progressive basis with a certain tax-exempt limit. The payment period should be short, and the means of payment can allow the use of public debt securities. The creation of this special donation was advocated by many people in the United Kingdom after the war. Dalton even thought that it was "at least representative of those sitting at home, paying back a moral debt to those who were running around on the battlefield and losing economic opportunities."</p>
<p>Third, try to prevent the connection between government credit and bank credit. For example, in our country today, various public debt regulations stipulate that public debt tickets can be used as guarantee reserves for bank issuance of paper money. Therefore, the result of the expansion of government credit is the creation of bank paper money expansion. If we want to make wartime government credit also have a considerable possibility of expansion in order to meet the needs of unavoidable wartime, then we need to first change the public debt regulations, at least cancel the legal qualification that wartime public debt can also be used as a guarantee reserve, in order to sever the connection between government credit and bank credit; only in this way can such government credit, after a considerable expansion, still be obtained within the safe limit.</p>
<p>Fourth, try to prevent government credit from exceeding the saturation capacity of social digestion of public debt, because the result is that either the public debt reserve immediately shakes; or after inflation, the currency credit, and even the entire financial institution, go bankrupt at the same time, because the public debt exceeds the social digestion capacity. The central bank will lose its commanding power to maintain the price of the debt market (that is, credit). Regardless of whether the bondholder is for speculative purposes or for the purpose of exchanging for a certain capital, they spit out a huge amount of public debt on the market, but the market is unable to digest it, resulting in a price drop. The central bank is unable to maintain it, which means that the government is unable to maintain credit. If credit shakes and they rush to sell, this trend will become unstoppable. If the central bank increases the issuance of paper money in order to maintain the debt market, the result is that the monetary system is sacrificed, but the public debt still comes to the same end. Especially during wartime, government credit is most easily shaken; the market atmosphere is also most easily confused. Therefore, the crisis of the storm is always there. The government's credit can determine the victory or defeat of the war; therefore, it must not be risked. If our wartime public debt policy operates within such a safe limit, then no matter what method it is issued, there will be no further objection.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the method of issuance, I would like to propose two types of special public debt for everyone to study. I believe that it is most appropriate to advocate them during wartime.</p>
<p>Adopting the method of folk champion associations, issue a special type of public debt with the goal of promoting people's reduced consumption, borrowing of saved income, and diverting it to war use. Therefore, it can be named Savings Public Debt. Giving a slight interest rate and stipulating a fairly long term; for the people, it is equivalent to savings: therefore, it can also be called Wartime Savings Public Debt. However, this type of public debt is not freely raised, but is allocated according to each person's wealth; therefore, it is also different from the United Kingdom's wartime savings bonds and the savings bonds adopted by various countries. And it cannot be sold on the market, and it is cleared in one lump sum when it expires. The advantages of this method: there is the possibility of obtaining a considerable amount of revenue as a forced donation, without the deep pain that people feel when their income is taken away as a forced donation. It has the effectiveness of general public debt, but it does not have the shortcomings of general public debt; because it cannot be sold on the market, and the interest rate is low, so it does not cause the danger of a credit storm, nor does it excessively increase the financial burden. In nature, it is similar to income tax, but income tax is not returned after payment: but this one can still be recovered: therefore, it is easier to issue than to collect income tax.</p>
<p>Adopting the method of company gift certificates, issue a commodity substitute bond to borrow surplus or saved products from the people for war use: those that cannot be used for war can be handed over to state-run commercial centers for sale. This type of bond can enable both those who own inventory and general producers to purchase them, while also directly meeting the war's demand for material resources. This bond is still paid with goods upon repayment. After a certain period of time, the bondholder can freely exchange the goods they need from the state-run commercial center once or several times; after the price of the goods they take has reached the face value, it will be cleared. In order to facilitate sales, a slight interest rate is also given. This bond can be sold on the market. Because it is itself a personification of purchasing power, it is not enough to cause a general credit crisis.</p>

<p>Grain Market: Steady Early Rice, Weak Later Rice</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs arrived, totaling more than thirty numbers, with a total of more than 6,000 piculs of goods. Both retail and wholesale were calm. The Tianjin gang only handled 1,000-odd packages in wholesale, so the market conditions were generally weak. Thick early rice continued to decline by several cents to one dime, thin rice slightly decreased, Doyang pointed rice fell by about a dime, the price remained flat and weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the gangs from the lower reaches of the river arrived with twenty-two or three boats. The retail of white rice was unusually deserted, and the market price dropped by about one dime. Early rice was stable, the retail of thin rice was ordinary, the wholesale was slightly active, the market shape rose nearly one dime, the middle and secondary grades were stable, and various sen rice also showed a weak trend. Yin goods were scarce, and the price was stable. The retail of white rice was sluggish, and the price decreased by about one dime. The prices of other goods were weak.</p>
<p>Seafood: New Inkfish Will Soon Be on the Market</p>
<p>Inkfish is dried cuttlefish, commonly known as bird thief. It is produced in various coastal areas of Zhejiang, with Yangshan, Shengshan, Daishan, and Zhoushan having the most, followed by Sijiao, Huanglong, Liuheng, Huaniao, Chuanshan, Qushan, Shenjiamen, Ligang, and Wenzhou. There is also production in Yantai and the Jiangbei area, called North Inkfish, but the output is far less than Ningbo. However, the quality is extremely good, the muscles are thick and the size is large, and it is clean and beautiful, which cannot be compared with Ningbo products. The wholesale price is also always more than one package higher. Twenty years ago, there were also goods from Japan, with the same shape as North Inkfish. Later, due to the increasing domestic production and the cheaper price, they were rejected. Every early summer, fishing households go out to sea to catch them in partnership. If they encounter a bumper harvest, they can harvest more than 100,000 dan a year. If the ocean does not produce, there are also 60,000 to 70,000 dan. There are about 10,000 people who make a living from this. The sales market is very wide, such as Min, Guang, Chuan, Xiang, and Gan, all have huge needs. Currently, new goods have not yet appeared on the market, and the amount of old goods in stock is scarce. In the hands of the dealers, the statistics are less than 1,000 pieces, so the market situation is very stable. The wholesale price of large pieces of North Inkfish is 58 yuan, medium pieces are 55 yuan, Ningbo goods are 28 yuan for large pieces, 23-24 yuan for Gaozhuang, and 21-22 yuan for ordinary goods. The future market must look at the richness of the new year's harvest to determine the honor and disgrace.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e102">After Foreign Firms’ Tea Business Stopped Exchange, Business Federation and Others Sent Representatives to Petition, Qian Chengxu Took the Petition to Nanjing to Transfer it to the Executive Yuan, and Met with Liu Zhenhua to Investigate the Actual Situation <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China General Chamber of Industry, due to Anhui Province’s implementation of centralized control of black tea, resulting in the closure of tea warehouses and the cessation of exchange, various places in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces sent telegrams to appeal. On the 15th, a joint meeting was held, and it was decided to send Qian Chengxu to Anhui to meet with Chairman Liu Zhenhua to specifically discuss the issues of centralized control and the cessation of exchange. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian’s Speech: Qian Chengxu, the representative sent by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China General Chamber of Industry, took a train to Nanjing from Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., and then went to Anqing to meet with Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of Anhui Province. According to Qian’s pre-departure statement, “My task in going to Anhui this time is entrusted by the two associations. Regarding the recent tea business in Anhui, as well as the two issues of exporting abroad, I will discuss with the authorities a method that is more suitable for the actual situation, so that it can increase soundness and fully exert its strength in the organization of the national economy at home and abroad. It is found that in recent years, China’s tea production has been squeezed by foreign tea, and the original overseas markets have been gradually seized by foreign tea. If the quality is not improved, it will undoubtedly decline more and more over time. Therefore, many enthusiastic industrialists in the country are running around calling for reform and feelings, and various writings can be seen on the recent situation in Anhui, or because of this relationship, there is its motive. However, tea has become an industry in China, and there are many places where it is related to the industry and commerce in various parts of the country. The export of tens of millions of dollars every year is enough to be an authoritative tool for balancing international trade, and its economic organization background is formed by the aggregation of various cellular components. For example, the tea warehouse is also one of the physical organizations, and its position is between the tea firm and the foreign merchant. It is in the position of a broker and represents both parties, each bearing its own responsibilities and guarantees. Today’s tea industry situation has not changed much in terms of transaction procedures compared to 30 years ago. The psychological trust of foreign merchants in tea warehouses can still be maintained. Therefore, once the organization is changed, whether the new organization can bear this heavy burden and whether it can gain the trust of foreign merchants are all questions. This is also the point that we should pay attention to. “The reporter asked, “What is the method to improve its organization?” Qian replied, “The scope of this section is very broad and cannot be answered in a short period of time. Choosing its main points, according to the main views and principles of the two associations, it has always been believed that the first step of unified control of products should be to improve the quality of the producing area as a prerequisite, and the sales part should still be operated by merchants, which is appropriate and easy to adjust in production and sales. Because merchants have a keen sense of cherishing and saving every penny of their own blood capital, so their expenses are not wasteful and are properly used. Even in the scope of business with no great profit, some profit can still be obtained due to proper business calculations. As for government-run enterprises, it is not to say that those who are in charge are all irresponsible people, but because their business knowledge is insufficient, and most of their parents are not from the business community, so they are separated by circumstances, or because of the lack of various connections, they end up with inflexible skills, and as a result, bad effects occur. Therefore, as soon as I arrive in Anhui, I plan to present the facts to the authorities in the province to seek understanding, but it is difficult to predict whether the goal can be achieved.”</p>
<p>The Petition of the Two Associations: Qian also carried the joint petition of the two associations to be submitted to Chairman Liu. The original text said, "Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government, the cessation of exchange of tea warehouses directly affects foreign trade and indirectly hinders domestic agriculture and commerce. At this time when the export of domestic tea is declining, occasionally due to system changes, it is not entirely appropriate, or because the timing is not yet ripe, it has been hit hard. The loss is not only the province that bears the brunt, but also the national economy and national industrial and commercial enterprises will also be affected, needless to say. Our association has witnessed the difficulties of the times, and believes that in the national economic organization, most of the old systems are not in line with modern trends, but they have been used for thousands of years, and their operation is still lively. There is a central force and a special environment, mutual communication, mutual attraction and mutual generation, and the spirit of the country and the relationship with foreign countries are entrusted to it. In short, the old system of China’s economic organization should take the promotion of its improvement and cooperation as a prerequisite. Overly radical behavior will lead to the disadvantage of wanting to be quick but not achieving the goal. Observing the recent realities in various provinces is enough to prove it. Now that your government is in charge of tea production, it is heard that it is being operated by a specially established agency. Shanghai tea warehouse merchants have stopped exchange due to misunderstandings. The domestic economy is on the verge of collapse, and foreign supply is also cut off. Our association believes that the timing is urgent and it is not appropriate to remain silent. Therefore, after a joint meeting, it was decided to publicly elect Qian Chengxu to make a special trip to pay respects to investigate the actual situation and make appropriate suggestions so that the current method is more suitable for the actual situation. We respectfully request to be granted an audience and guidance. This is what we hope for. Guo Shun, Chairman of the China General Chamber of Industry, and Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully kowtow."</p>
<p>Continued Cessation of Exchange: The 14 tea warehouses including Zhongxin Chang and others of the Foreign Firms Tea Industry Association have been closed for many days due to their opposition to Anhui Province’s unified control of Qihong tea and the implementation of cessation of exchange and business. The tea warehouses in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have stopped exchange, affecting the finances of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. In addition, hundreds of thousands of tea farmers, tea workers, and tea merchants have been greatly affected. They have sent telegrams to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the tea warehouses be ordered to exchange drafts to reassure people. Yesterday, I inquired about the Foreign Firms Tea Industry Association to see if there was any indication of resumption of exchange. According to the spokesperson of the association, "The purpose of our association is all expressed in the official statement.

Before a real solution is obtained, we have decided to continue the cessation of exchange."</p>
<h3 id="e103">Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau Urges Improvement of Escort Equipment, Deadline for Detailed Reporting within Ten Days <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that the sea navigation and security equipment of the various wheels traveling on the inner and outer rivers are dilapidated, and in the event of incidents such as bandits riding robbery or unexpected wind and rain, there is no way to ensure the safety of passengers, and the loss of goods and the death of passengers are often heard. Now, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau and the privately-owned Sanbei, Ningshao, Datong, Dazhen and other larger shipping companies in the port have gradually improved all the escort equipment of the ships traveling on the near-sea, ocean, Yangtze River lines, etc., so the number of accidents has gradually decreased. However, most shipping companies still have to simplify the equipment due to capital relations, which is contrary to the maritime regulations. The bureau has recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications to strictly urge the various shipping companies to improve the escort equipment. Now the bureau has printed forms, which will be distributed to the various wheel companies, and all the companies are required to fill them out and report them to the bureau within ten days from the date of the document for review and handling. The bureau will try to improve the equipment according to the situation of each wheel, otherwise it will be banned.</p>
