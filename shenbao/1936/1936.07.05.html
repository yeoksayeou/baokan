<p>— 隅</p>
<p>我們再別放長脖子望他國的援助事實早已告訴我們經過幾年的擾攘那奠定歐戰後太平洋局勢的華府條的以及那條的中一部分保持中國領土完整的九國公的已如「一顆腐敗的捲心菜」一樣被那以侵略爲國策的國家棄置在一邊了這不但使太平洋的局勢失其平衡並且對一世紀以來的美國對東亞的外交政策給了致命的打擊四年來執掌美國政權的民主黨外交政策對於東亞問題一向保持沉默他們葫蘆裏究竟賣的什麽藥至少在目前我們尙不能確切知道似乎美國對中國門戶開放政策已改絃易轍似乎美國不承認以武力佔得土地的原則已成尾聲似乎申張凱洛格非戰公的的蘊義已變爲具文新中立法案的通過美國又像歐戰後一樣退歸到她的傳統的孤立主義不問美洲以外的事甚至連東亞的事件也趨於十分消極我們看到美國放棄了菲列濱而准許她獨立我們看到新中立法案通過後美國輿論界認爲這還不澈底的意見我們看到美國許多政論家認爲要從日本手中奪回中國須犧牲一百萬的靑年五千萬萬的美金一千五百年的貿易然後繼能償還這筆損失的論調我們知道無論執政的領袖以及一般民衆是不願爲了與他們無切身利害關係的紙上條的的尊嚴有多大犧牲的所以在這總統選舉年到來歷來左右美國政治的最大兩黨——民主黨和共和黨——競選的外交政鋼我們可以看出牠們一致的保持孤立主義不爲他國牽累的傾向民主黨的政綱中主張　繼續進行羅斯福總統的睦鄰政策　對於他國相爭中維持中立　對於國際貿易事務或私人貿易愼防捲入任何戰爭雖則競選政綱中也有重申凱洛格非戰公的目的一條這看起來已不過是應景的點綴而並不關怎樣重要的而共和黨的競選外交政綱則更乾脆地說明美國不締結任何同盟條的不作任何政治提供諾言連以前共和黨所一手造成的非戰公的也一字不提前共和黨的胡佛主義和史汀生對東省事伴的旁敲側擊的外交宣言也一筆抹煞似乎美國對束亞外交政策有改變了然而美國外交政策的實質果眞有特殊的改變了麽事實上無論美國怎樣保持沉默無論美國國內民衆怎樣畏懼戰爭美國可以不問歐洲事件她對太平洋事件决不能同時也甘心置身事外以孤立政策爲基調的共和黨當胡佛時代猶且爲了東省事件由那時國務卿史仃生表示願與國聯合作共同對付日本則傳威爾遜衣缽的民主黨我們又怎能相信其與過去絕緣而完全對東亞退却呢目前的無明白表示我們相信也許是迎合國內民衆心理的一種競選策略我們知道羅斯福在上屆選舉獲勝後對於胡佛總統雖有非難對於史汀生却保持非常親密的關係就任之前曾召史氏有所諮詢四年來的羅斯福外交政策正如有些人所說的的一樣是沿襲老羅斯福的故智「負了很重的戰艦而走著很輕的步子」那就是表面上保持沉默而暗中在凖備軍事羅斯福雖持這樣態度然而有時也不能忍住他的沉默二年前當日本宣佈門戶關閉政策的時候他也像史汀生一樣發表宜言表示反對但當他知道無濟於事的時候他卽埋頭於海陸空軍建設工作大海軍政策其目的何在其對象爲何不言可喻還有二件事可以證明美國執政者不忘情於太平洋的其一是美國太平洋航空錢由汎美航空公司承辦以舊金山爲出發點橫渡太平洋而達斐列濱香港澳洲等處並收加維斯培克及霍倫三島入美國版圖以爲開關夏威夷至澳洲航空分站之用最近復在阿拉斯加地方范朋克城附近建築强大空軍根據地這種置於軍部控制下的航空事業並非專爲交通之具識者早已知之其二自海軍會議中日本宜言退出海會後美國卽在太平洋的領土間擴大海軍根據地不獨對於薩摩亞島關島阿拉斯加增强其軍港的設備不獨以夏威夷爲中心强化珠港海軍根據地並且對於允許其獨立的菲列濱亦使其有充分之實力凡此皆足證明美國並不願毫無條件的退出太平洋而屈居於配角的地位所以有人設美國和平與戰爭的决定是在下屆總統選舉後始能分明這種觀察有相當理由的</p>

着漏船，在淺河裏打魚的漁夫，牛一般地匍匐在身秧田中，赤着膊耘草的農人，他們的生活內幕，是人間抑是地獄，那是不好深於替他們想像的，否則自己暫時間超脱現實生活一環的刹那美念，便要極快的變成了一現的　華。　　松江是滬杭路下行車的第一個大站，景物優美，交通便捷，在上海住得太膩，欲想一新眼界，又嫌蘇州杭州稍遠的話，摒擋來些一遊，倒也嘸啥。這裏有雲間第一樓，建築崇宏，柱粗合抱，己是兩千年的古物。相傳樓前一帶的地方，當年還是大海，三國時，吴都督周瑜操練海軍，曾在此樓點兵拜將。地質學家稱海岸逐漸東展，每六十年平均約有一俚，可為互證。離城十餘裏的風景區佘山上，還有一大天文台，內儲測騐攝製所得的珍貴圖表影片等，遊覽等藉可得到天文方面的許多珍聞和常識。城西秀野橋河中所產的四鰓鱸，自經古人品題之後，便歷學享盛名不衰。松江文風向來很盛，晋時陸機陸雲，明季幾社復社，在文化運動史上，都占重要的一頁，清季松江原是府治，轄上海等縣，曾幾何時，上海一躍而成世界有數的大都市，松江近在咫尺間，商號裝潢，遊藝園設備，都拼命的追效，上海，祇可惜那些狹隘街道，古老建築，却不能跟着摇身一變了。　　嘉興紙廠及勝景　　嘉興所滬杭路的中心，為該路口入浙的一大站與上海蘇州勢成犄角，新近蘇嘉鐵路築成，地勢尤形衝要。公路水路，更其四通八達，嘉城將來的都市繁華，必有長足的進展，記者乘早車來，原預備在此下車，參觀國內造紙業數一數二的民豐造紙廠。該廠距車站約裏許，規模宏大，組織完備，資本一百二十五萬元，全係股東商辦。廠分新老二部，老廠創自民國十九年，專出紙版，以供各種硬紙盒用，原料不過是些稻草。麻袋和廢紙等。新紙廠專造香烟紙，機件更較精美，今年剛才開辦，現在還在打樣期間，成績己非常可觀。一面運進去的是些麻，魚網，夏布，等不倫不類的舊東西，一面便抽出不知若幹長度的雪白烟紙，大捲大綑的擺在眼前，真是可愛可喜，而且它是民族工業，羅參觀外國任何大工廠還要特别高興。　　造紙的程序，由女工先按原料的粗細黑白，分揀出來，各置一處。另由男工用切車把牠　碎，轉入蒸汽或電氣發動的機器間，置於數大蒸球內，每球可容草五噸，用五十磅的蒸汽力（即極熱烈的溫度），把牠蒸瀾煮熱，注入成漿間，加以洗滌漂白，漸成細膩白淨的紙漿，自行流入造紙機，用寬長合度的毛　，以及極細軟的銅絲網輪，互相提濾索引，去水留筋，便是紙胎，假若一紙而有表裏之分，或者中間再夾上一層粗料，那就要用兩三層紙胎，依次互相附着，長匹的抽送到烘乾間去，用輪機邊壓邊烘，使紙去濕風乾，平滑發光，收捲成裝，於是大功告成。自原料轉入蒸球，以至成紙，主要都用機器力，人工反覺清閒無事，香烟紙約　十時製成，紙版半天即可出貨，機器的魔力，真是偉大啊。　　該廠全部職工，約計七百餘人。工作每日十小時，每月最高薪職員為二百元，工人八十元，最低薪職員二十元，工人十三元。女工以日計，僅二角五分，或二角八分，滿月僅七八元，但她們專任揀選原料，灰塵飛滿全室，空氣非常污濁，却是一件容易染有肺病危險的工作。近年各地文化事業，例如報館書局以及其他學術機關的出版物，無不風起雲湧，可是所出巨量的紙張，大多數都是舶來品。現有民豐廠能造香烟紙及紙版，上海龍華造紙廠能造道林紙，堪稱挽回此項外溢利權的兩部生力軍。此外還有官商合辦的溫溪造紙廠，原是預備造報紙的，但籌備歷時己久，還不曾見她姗姗而出，大概就因為沾了幾分官氣，便搭起十足官架子來了吧？　　　出民豐造紙廠，時候還早，又去看了幾處古蹟。一處是東塔寺，塔高十二丈，後有　朱買臣墓。一處是六帆亭，亭榭和石山的結構，尚小巧玲瓏。此外風景最好，要　南湖烟雨樓。南湖又呌鴛湖，是與另一個鴦湖對稱的。烟雨樓的局勢，很像西子湖的三潭印月，和大明湖的鐵公祠。宋蘇東坡曾三遊其地，元末詩妓羅愛愛，大會文士於此樓，清高守和孫中山也曾先生來過，似乎都是烟雨樓的光榮，所以都有　　碑文匾額可按。然而實際吸引遊客的，恐怕還是一般畫航玉人，（俗呼船　，）她們打扮成花枝招展般的樣兒，簡直遊　到火車站來兜生意。划船時却另有幫手（老太婆）去划，她們恰是陪伴遊客談笑的香餌。假如你是此中的「老在行，」過路聽見她們「擺渡」的嬌呼，而你又無乘船的必要時，　真要感到比伍子胥過昭　還困難。　　後搭下午五時開的下行車，於七時到達杭州。一路桑　稻田，平鋪如茵，直到杭州，才得見山。唐李翰曾有「嘉禾穰，江淮為之康，嘉禾歉江淮為之儉」之語，可見嘉湖一帶的土地，是早以肥腴稱世的，不過現在人口激增，恐無餘糧外運了。嘉興的東塔</p>

<p>兒童專刊服務　　人生以服務爲目的的小朋友們如果做過童子軍的，一定知道這是童子軍铭言中的一项，這句話的意思是說人生在世界上，他的目的是服務，反之，如不服務，那麼他的生活枯燥，没有意思，可見服務是多麼的重要。　　我們要爲別人而服務。不要別人爲我而服務，前者是國家的棟樑，國家所需要，而歡迎的。後者是國家的蠹蟲，國家所不需要，而排斥的，小朋友們！任你們選擇吧。　　服務没有時間性的，隨時隨地都要服務，而服務也要出於自願，不受旁人使喚，那麼在服務時更會高興，結果所得的成績一定非常美滿　　服務的種類，分爲家庭服務及公衆服務，家庭服務在家中幫助父母做，一切瑣屑的事情。公眾服務包括很廣，我現在把其中一部分說，學校服務，學校中事務很多，只因同學們的精力有限，所以是分工合作的，你要把你分得的事情，做得盡美盡善，有益於學校，同學。　　服務的益處，對於個人方面，在服務中能得到許多知識經驗，發展思想，練習做事的技能。對於團體方面，非伹有益於衆人，並可養成互助的精神。發明郵票的人  楊志剛　　在一百年前，我們假使要寄一封信，從北平到南京，至少要需一二個月。因爲那時的寄信方法，是完全由「驛姑」傅遞的，寄費則差不多是看路途的遠近而取的，寄費的大小也完全由驛站上的人任意索取。但是現在呢？「驛站」早巳廢除了，信的寄遞完全是利用火車和輸船等了！所以假使要從北平寄一封信到南京祇要二三天就可以到了！寄費只耍五分錢買一張郵票，貼在信上，就可以安穩地從北平寄到南京。但是貼郵禀的方法究竟是誰發明的，這是很值得我們談談的。　　英國從前有一個富紳，名字叫做蘭易洛。有一天當他正在散步的時候，看見一個郵差將信送給一位姑娘手中，並且要向那姑娘索取寄費，但是那姑娘在信封上一瞧，便說：「我因爲沒有錢拿信，所以請您拿回去吧!」當時蘭易洛便從口袋裏拿出錢來，代姑娘取了那封信。等郵差走後，姑娘就對蘭易洛說：「這是我哥哥給我的信，不過我們家裏很是貧困，所以同哥哥約好一個方法；假使在信封上畫一個圆圈，就是表示近安的意思，我看見了這個記號，就可以不必取信了！」　　蘭易洛自從遇到此事以後，便覺悟郵政有改革的必要，於是就於一八三七年奏章提議，改用貼郵票的方法，郵费由寄信人拿出，於是就便當得很多了！一八三九年五月七日上議院主張實行郵票，結果開會通過，並舉蘭易洛為郵務總長。一八四〇年一月十日，郵票便首次在倫敦發行了！西北的兒童  閻重樓　　我久住在上海，接近的多是東南的兒童，最近，我有一個機會到西北去了，一次，得和西北的兒童接近。現在我來把西北兒童的情形簡單的報告一下：　　西北因為地處高原缺乏雨潤，所以土地乾枯，人民比較窮困，當然兒童的生活也比較可憐了！他們常是吃不飽，穿不暖，進不起學校，……但是他們的精神卻是很振作的。我常在路上看見那些兒童們，他們都是剃光着頭，走着很快的步子，沒有一點貪玩的樣兒。他們常常幫助着大人做做工作，有些有志求學的，便想出半工半讀的法子，至於那些學校的兒童，他們也很是勤樸，他們能用功，有禮貌，衣服整潔，課完了就回到家裏，聽受父母的教訓。（雖然也有些墮落的頑皮的兒童，但很佔少數。）。　　據我看來，東南的兒童環境是好得多了，所以更應該加倍努力。就是有些環境清貧的，也應該仿效西北兒童吃苦耐勞　門不懈的精神才好。兒童自由畫　　海島舞刀曲  陳鐵吾　　一刀，一刀，　　割下麥來做麵包，　　割下麥桿當柴燒　　我是小工人，　　我有臂膀和小刀。　　一刀，一刀，　　一刀，一刀，　　　　殺下敵人頭，　　當着西瓜抛，　　我是小軍人，　　我有小馬和小刀　　一刀，一刀。　　　　一刀,一刀，　　斬除地球上的荊棘，　　创选平坦的大道，　　我是小天使，　　我要把這世界改造。蜻蜓的悲哀  戶人　　一隻剛才脱離水　生活的蜻蜒，在中飛來飛去，它以爲自己到了一個新世界裹來了，所以非常快樂。　　忽然，看見一個奇怪的黑東西，在那裹動着，仔細一看，這怪物的四週都佈滿了許多細而盡色的綫，好像一個網，那蜻蜓奇怪極了，它想這世界上的生物，不，是在空中飛來飛去，便在地上爬行，那有停留在空中的呢？　　它正在思索的時候，忽見一雙小蟲飛來，一不留神被網抓住了，它拚命地在掙扎，那黑東西覺得網在動了，便爬近小蟲去，只見那小蟲動了最後的一動便死了，那怪物便慢慢地把它吃着。　　蜻蜒看完了這一幕慘據後，不覺悲傷地嘆道：『唉！可憐極了！在這燦爛的新世界中，竟有爲滿足自己私慾而不顧其他一切的生物呢？哎！這眞慘極了！』它不願再見這種無公理的慘劇而回到它的水鄉去了!什麽呌做流線型？  　　流線型，「流綫型」這個名詞在近來很是流行，　新出　　用具大都冠以一個「流綫型」的名稱，就像：流綫型的汽車，流綫型的火車……都是。　　諸位小朋友們對於這「流綫型」的名詞，我想一定早已聽到過了！但是我同時也想到，也許有很多小朋友要發生一個疑問，就是：「什麽叫做流綫型？」倒底什麼叫做流綫型呢？　　「流綫」就是　水流的綫絛，「流綫型」就是說它的式樣很像水流的綫一條，而爲了便於呼喊起見，所以不稱「水流綫型」而稱「流綫型」，這便是「流綫型」名稱之由來流綫型交通器具因其在前進時能减少空氣，或水中的阻力，所以他們的速度比不是「流線型」的要快得多；因此「流線型」的發明，很受一般人的歡迎，在現代的交通界中，創一個嶄新的紀錄！　　我們既已知道「流線型」在交通界應用上之重要，我們也應該悉知它的鼻祖是什麽？　　告訴你：魚便是「流線型」的鼻祖！有了魚才有「流線型」的交通器具！以上便是：「什麼叫做流線型？」有趣的科學把戲  王云　　做一個有趣的騐電器　　把戲是要時常玩的，越玩越有興趣。你看，小林和一青又在那裏做一個騐電器的把戲呢。這個把戲，會使你更覺得奇怪。祇要一　洋蠟燭，或一盞火酒燈和一張白報紙，一隻軟木塞和針就可以玩了。　　你看着：　　現在，小林把針插在軟木塞上，拿了一張白報紙，剪成箭頭形（或十字形），齊中央摺一條深縐紋，把它放在针尖上，使它平衡在上面。（如圖）。一青等小林把騐電器做成功之后，他便裁了一張長的紙條，很細心的放到火上去烘熱。烘熱之後，馬上就放到一本書上，用大拇指甲，施勁的在紙條上摩擦了十來下。小林教他拿得靠近紙箭頭去旋轉。哈哈，紙箭就跟着這紙條，左右的旋轉起來了。　　我看他們玩得很有趣，便教他們另外來玩一個戲法。把紙條子烘熟摩擦之後，立刻放到牆壁上去，它就會黏在上面。眞的，一青立刻玩了一下，就喊着說：「紙條貼在牆上了！」我又聽他們放到桌邊去試試看，也一樣的黏住了。再叫他們放到別處去試試，因爲時間太久。電已傳到接觸物上去，便靈了。一青要求我把這兩個把戲的道理，講給他聽。我就請小林去告訴他。為什麼紙條烘熱，經過摩擦，就會引得紙箭旋轉呢？我們要知道，無論什麼東西，都是原子構造成功的。原子裏的核帶陽電，原子核的周圍，有許多電子旋轉着。這些電子是帶陰電的。本來，原子裏的陽電核和陰電子，互相平街，不起帶電的作用。可是把紙烘乾了摩擦，那些構成紙的原子，都更活動起来啦。有些電子便逃了出來，於是就起帶電的作用了，我們的紙上便帶了電，拿它靠近紙箭，便把紙箭吸得旋轉起来。紙條子能貼在牆壁和桌沿上，也是因爲紙上带電的緣故。注重公衆衛生  古今莊　　—　切勿隨地吐痰　　隨地吐痰，這是我國人民最不良最不講衛生的惡習慣，不論是馬路上，或公共場所，到處可以見到我們吐出來的排泄物－－痰－－濃而且厚的，使人見了禁不住要打噁，輕渺的隨地吐著。因此外國人含著卑鄙的對待我們中國人，在外國的公園内或會集的地方，輕易是不許我們進去的，我們自己也覺得羞慚嗎？並且我們要知道在痰裏面是含著無數的細菌，假使一個生肺癆病的人，在路上隨意的吐了一口痰，那麼經過了太陽的曬，把病菌佈滿在空氣中，使別人很輕易的傳染到，所以在夏天有許多人往往很好的在路上行走，而碰到了這種惡劣　空氣，以致於死的，也不在少數，所以吐痰非但是不衛生並且是傳染病的媒介者。奉勸小朋友們！我們要注重公共衛生，不要在學校裏或馬路上任意的吐痰。這是極應注意的。兒童創作暑假到了　　萬竹五年級生曹宏輝　　親愛的小同學們，光陰如箭，一轉眼又放暑假了。我們在幼稚時代，應當用功讀書，力求上進。父母拿汗血換來的金錢，給我們做子女的讀書費，做子女的，也應該給父母一些的快樂和希望。今我做這篇「暑假到了，」是希望全國的小朋友，大家在暑假中要用功。求學業上的進展。今將我個人的一二意見，寫在下面　　①温習功課　　现在是七月的七旬了。多數的學校，已放暑假了。在這暑假期間，應該要溫習功課，將平時不大明白的地方，問問父兄。　　②練習書法　書法也是課程中的一課，如小楷中楷大楷等類，小朋友們，對於寫字，很少研究。要知寫字，也是做人的一技，早上應該早些起身，練習一二小時。　　③万相識騐　在這暑假期中，除自己溫習外，倘有姊弟們在一個校裏讀書，應該互相識騐。如算學一課，姊姊出數字，教導弟妹算做，其他作文默書等課，也可相互試騐，以作下學期上課的準備。童子軍信箱我們的營地在那裏　　答蕪湖李如樑　　如　弟弟：　　來信說你總覺得没有地方露營。還在我們童子軍生活中，的確是一個重要問題。不過，我們以爲，只要你能準備，不要到了露營的那一天，才去找營地，那自然難解决了。　　這裏讓我們給你一個怎樣準傭的提議，你看可行嗎？你和你的小隊，每次出發露營，最好不要在一起，而去分成兩組。出發時，一組向東（或北）一組向西（或南），大家背道而馳，假定這是星期六的下午，你們就以步行三小時至四小時爲限，是走直綫的，大約走十華里左右。走到將近三十里或三小時後，你們就找那可以露營的地方。——所謂可以露營的地方，那是指能得飲料，食料，燃料的便利，地方乾爽，環境良好，並目當地人允许露營的地方。　　要是第一次你找到這樣一塊地方，只要你們能遵守露營的規則，那麼這一塊地方，便是你們永久的營地了。倘然你們在露營山，能將服務當地，列在你們工作生活中，那當地人，是更會歡迎你們了。　　這樣，一小隊，在一次露營中，不是就能得到　　　露營地了嗎？　種露營地——你們自己去發現來的地方。我們暫時　牠爲營站，你說好嗎？要是同時有兩小隊出發——四組，那就能得東南西北四個營站了，有了四小隊，就可有八方位的營站。總之，這是方位式地，去自己找尋我們自己的營地。　　在第二次露營的時候，你們就可以交换一個新營站去露营了。不過第一次找尋到了的時候，有兩件事，你一定要做好：做好響導的記號：繪製一張營站草圖，這是給另一組人，下來時的方便　　但是，這不過是初步工作，我們就　牠第一圖，我們還希望你們能做第二步工作——找尋第二圈的營站。方法和第一次差不多，不過以的第一圖的營站爲出發點。希望，每組人過半年中我們，或一年內，找能到一個營站，合起來就是三圈。而第三圈的營站，和你們原來位的地方——第一圈以前的出發點，距離和路程。最好以一天內能到走的爲限。　　如　弟，要是每一個童于軍小隊能這樣做，各地的童子軍都能這樣做，那麼不出兩三年功夫，我們這種理想的營站便能普遍全國了，誰說我們會沒有地方露營呢？　　你說，這種辦法好嗎？我們願意和這多多討論這個問題，我們更願意聽到你的意見，希望還會有信給我們！要是你實行去做了，希望你會將你的計劃，經過情形，以及一切圖畫照片，隨時寄給我們，我們願意将　介紹給別的小朋友，祝你努力！　　中圃童子軍自助社謹覆方位式地我　營地  中國童子軍自助社設計義狗傳（二十五）  心書　　但是柏德希却不　意安然的留在這燈光和暖氣中，享受那融融洩洩的樂趣。它雖然又冷又餓，但是沒有小南洛同在一起，它決不肯獨享安樂的。因此它拒絕了一切的誘惑，自　悄悄地靠近了門站着，只等候着一個脫逃的機會。柯甘士連嘆息道：「義狗呀義狗！它是要它的小主人，等到天明之後，我立刻出外找尋那孩子去。」　　柏德希心中很明白小南洛早巳不在屋中，特　將它留下在這裏，而獨自和飢寒困苦抵抗去了。　　磨坊的廚房中是非常的暖和，壁爐裏堆着許多挺大的木塊在熊熊地燃燒着．　人們都進來喝一杯酒，吃一片肥嫩的鵝肉，慶祝這聖誕節的來臨。小愛洛確信伊的好　小南洛明天一定回來，便分外的快樂，不住的跳着唱着，揮動伊那一頭黃澄澄的金絲髪。柯甘士心花怒放，含淚帶笑的瞧着他的女兒：柯甘士夫人悄悄地坐在紡機旁邊，滿臉現出很滿足的神情；那大鐘裏的杜鵑依時探出頭來，也似乎很快樂的報着時刻。可是柏德希一動都不動，因爲沒有小南浴在一起，它是不會覺得快得的。　　　　．　　到時宴席巳經排好，歡笑的聲音異常热鬧的當兒，柏德希趁着一位客人進門沒有將門帶上的機會，疾忙捉空兒溜了出去，挪動着它那疲弱的四肢，飛一般在雪地上跑去，直　到漆黑的夜色中去了。這時它的心中只有一個思想，就是要追趕小南洛，它決不想到自己的安樂，它並且很清楚的記得當年它自巳病到在路旁溝渠中的時候，有一個老頭兒和小孩子搭救了它。　　雪又下了，已足足的下了一個黄昏；此刻快要十點鐘了；小南洛的脚跡差不多都被那雪遮蓋住了。柏德希費了好多的氣力和時間追尋它的小主人的踪跡。它好容易的終於找到了。一會兒却又不見，像這樣的一會兒找到一會兒不見，機幾乎有一百多次之多。　　夜風括得很大，路邊的燈全都被風吹熄了。路上的雪凍給得成了冰片；那濃厚的夜色，把所有的屋子完全裹住，四下裏早就沒有人跡了。村中的男女全在屋子裏宴飲作樂，連那牛羊等一切牲畜也回到了它們的柵欄中去。在這一天寒冷的風雪中，只有柏德希獨個兒在奔跑着…身上又冷，肚子裏又餓，它畢竟是太老了，分外的感到痛苦，然而仗着它那片熱戀小主人的血性，仍然掙扎着，向前找尋過去。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊藝壇評蹦蹦戲演出的「潘金蓮」  戲迷　　我過去從未看過蹦蹦戲，因為我相信了人家的宣傳，眞以為這種戲劇是內容「淫蕩」的低級趣味，是有閒的老爺太太們所特別愛好的。但同時我又聽說蹦蹦戲頗受上海人歡迎，如「潘金蓮」等劇更是長期地演出，長期地都有廣大的觀衆，大有「欲罷不能」之勢。這便有些令人懷疑了，為什麽會有那樣多的人看蹦蹦戲呢？未必完全是因為這戲劇太「淫蕩」的緣故嗎？為要解决這個疑問，我便决心「下水」，在最近去看了幾回蹦蹦戲。　　在我的印象上，覺得蹦蹦戲所採用的題材與京戲的就有些不同：前者多係採用民間故事，家庭生活；而後者所有的題村却多半是皇家貴族神仙俠客的獨特事蹟。其次是在表演形式方面，我以為蹦蹦戲的化裝，表情和說白等，比較起別的舊劇　，都是較民間化，通俗化，易於了解的；就拿唱詞來說吧，蹦蹦戲的也要一比京戲的容易聽得懂，它的調子沒有京戲的複雜。由於這些，所以蹦蹦戲才為一般上海市民所歡迎，不僅為有閒的老爺太太們所愛好。事實上，這戲的觀衆主要的還是一般中小商人，店員以及普通一般家庭的男女，所謂有開的老爺太太實居最少數。當然，「淫蕩」與這戲劇之為一般上海人所歡迎也有關係，但它之進得廣大觀衆的主要原因，我以為還是上述那些；此外，它的票價較低也可說是它能賣座的原因之一。　　現在，我們要具體地來談談潘金蓮，這恐怕要算是蹦蹦戲中最好最受人歡迎的吧。　　「潘金蓮」是依據中國有名的章部小說「水　傳」的一段故本編成的戲劇。因為「水滸傳」在民間流行得最廣　所謂「武松役嫂的事幾乎誰都知道，所以由此脫化出的蹦蹦戲「潘金蓮」首先就能引起人們的注意。不過，它之受到觀衆喝采的主要原因，我以為還是在於它有較為進步的思想內容。　　大家知道，「水滸傳」道部小說是站在一般農民立塲，反對實官污吏，惡覇土劣的，最後可說是表現了當時一部分對現實不滿，想在不變動那現實的社會基礎之下，更換統治人物的封建地主思想。在潘金蓮調叔，武松殺嫂一節，一方面自然是暴露了惡覇西門慶的罪惡，但同時在另一方面，也是在對建的「嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗」這個觀念下，把潘金蓮簡單地描盡成了一個下流的淫婦；至於潘金蓮之被劣紳張大戶壓迫和陷害等情節，在「水滸傳」中只是略略提了一下，並未展開來描寫，以致使人覺得一切罪惡都在潘金蓮一人身上。然而在蹦蹦戲的舞臺上演出的「潘金蓮」却不是這樣。它首先是把劣紳張大戶的淫逸頹廢的生活與橫暴作惡的行為活現了出來，它具體地告訴觀衆：張大戶有兩個老婆，有許多丫頭，他每天抽大烟，過着墮落的生活；在無聊的墮落生活中，他更想强迫丫頭潘金蓮為妾，，以發洩淫慾；因為潘金蓮不願作姨太太，死不依從，他竟自設法將她嫁與愚昧醜陋的武大，企圖使她在對這婚姻不滿意之後再回到自己懷抱裹來。這樣，張大戶便成為了倚勢欺人，淫亂橫暴的劣紳典型。其次，對於潘金蓮的與人私通，謀害親夫武大的行為，由這戲劇的表現，使人認識出那罪過不在潘金蓮自身，而是在劣紳張大戶與惡覇西鬥慶的惡行，是山對建社會的對建勢力，封建思想所造成的。當最後武松拿着刀要殺潘金蓮的時候，她卽當衆勇敢地承認武大是被毒死的　，但她同時又指出毒死武大的不是她自己，而是張大戶；這會博得了一般觀衆的喝采。　　舞臺上出現的武松和小說上的武松一樣，是一位英俊的典型的封建英雄。他為了替自己的哥哥復仇，竟不顧一切地殺死了惡覇西門慶，這當然會使人拍掌稱快，但同時他却不明白所謂土劣惡覇的惡行是由他們所支配的社會特許的，更不明白潘金蓮謀害親夫的行為是土劣惡覇所支配的社會促成的，所以對於潘金蓮的遭遇他竟不發生一點同情心理，只是在為兄報仇的一個簡單的觀念下，把一把無情的鋼刀刺進了潘金蓮的心頭。事實是。。在潘金蓮最後還在表示她愛武松的時候，這位英雄却說「你愛我，但我要愛我的哥哥」，於是就把潘金蓮一刀殺死了：這一方面自然會使人覺得武松眞不愧為一個英雄，但同時，却也不能不令人　惜潘金蓮的遭遇。　　劇中的潘金蓮並不像小說中的潘金蓮那樣：是只知道一偷漢子的淫婦」；反之她可說是反對封建勢力力反對封建思想的一個典型的女子。她是張大戶所養的丫頭，而張大戶又是有錢有勢的員外，對她是寵愛已極；只要她能依從去作姨太太，什麽都可將就她：這在有些勢利心很重，只想滿足個人物質生活的女人，不消說是要樂從的，但為人作丫頭的潘金蓮却誓死反抗，勇敢地宜布她絕不為人作小老婆，絕不嫁給年齡不相當的老頭子，明白地表示出了她的「一夫一妻制」的較新的思想，說她要嫁給一個在各方面都相當的沒有妻室的男人。隨後在張大戶惡毒的陷害之下，潘金蓮嫁給了愚味醜陋的武大的時候，她的心中常然是很痛苦的，眞是如像坐在「地獄中」一般；但這時却在她的眼前出現了一個俊秀勇武的英雄武松，使她如在「地獄中看見了太陽」一樣，因之她的向武松表示愛意也是情理巾的事，不能說她是淫蕩。戲劇對於這一點的表現，也不是站在對建的立塲將潘金蓮形容成為一個下流淫婦。至於潘金蓮的與西門慶私通，那在戲中更是表現出了她的戀愛的變態心理；表現出了她在真誠地愛武松遭了拒絕之後，因為西門慶與武松有某些類似之處，所以一見之後就與他私通起來。當武大死後，張大戶遺人來奪回潘金蓮的時候她會明白地指出了西門慶的弱點，說她並不真同時就是一般觀眾也要大為　驚。至於她最後的那段英勇的表白，那更是會獲得觀眾的同情的。像這樣形態的潘金蓮，像這樣反抗封建勢力的女人，像這樣具有較新的戀愛觀和熱情的婦女，恐怕是在別的舊劇中所見不到的吧。　　戲劇的藝術表現力也還不錯。如對於張大戶的橫暴，武大的誠實，武松的英勇，何九叔的謹慎胆小，西門慶的恃強欺人，都很生動地描畫了出來；對於武大死後張大戶吩咐何九叔的傲　形態，武松歸來會見何九叔的緊張情形　，最後對於武松殺嫂的全劇的頂點地方，都活現了出來，都把全體觀眾的眼光和心意吸引在、舞臺上去了。至於劇中的對白，也有許多精彩的地方，不過我不大記得淸楚了，如最後一塲就有大意如像這樣的對話：　　潘金蓮向武松說：「你是要我的頭，還是要我的心？」　　武松說：我本想挖你的心，……」　　潘余蓮走向武松，解開紐扣，露出前胸說：「很好，這兒有一顆很熱很紅的心，正耍獻給你；不，早已獻給你了！……」　　……　　像這樣的對話，簡直可說和新的劇詞一樣。　　當然我不是說蹦躐戲演出的「潘金蓮」是盡善盡美的戲劇，我只是站在把它與一般舊劇相比較的觀點上來評價它的。蹦蹦戲究竟是蹦蹦戲，它的內容與形式在現代意義上都是落後的；就是比較進步的「潘令蓮」，其形式自然不消說仍是舊的蹦蹦戲形式，同時其思想內容，嚴格說來，也是不澈底的。不過，在目前情形之下，我覺得大家與其去看「白蛇傳」，「濟公案」……一類的京劇，倒不如去看蹦蹦戲的「潘金蓮」的好，因為後者畢竟要進步些。更正　　上期本刊「後樓日記」末尾之「（未完）」二字，誤被拚版人在改大樣時於忽促之間（因時已深晚）排在「德國舊有殖民地概况」一文之後，特此更正。常識人能夠活到幾歲？  洪庸　　關於人類的壽命，在中國向來有許多神話；如盤古和天皇地皇人皇三氏都享壽幾萬歲，彭祖活了八百零八秋，老子在他母親身上就被懷孕了八十三年，許多修練成仙的人都永久不死等等，便是關於人類壽命的神話的具體表現。但俗話說得好，「山中雖有千年樹，世上難逢百歲人」，一個人的壽命終究有限，不管有好多神話來作證據，事實上活了發百幾千幾萬年乃至長生不老的人却是絕對不曾有過的；而且，我們還要說，人類的壽命與時代的進化大有關係，時代越進化，越是進到新的階叚，人類的平均壽命卽有越是增長之可能。照一般市俗的見解，以為古人的壽命長，今人的壽命短，這乃是由於被那些神話所惑，以及只注意到歷史上某些壽命較長的人物而未見到全體所發生出來的一種錯覺，是違反進化觀點的說法。據一位名呌里加德生的美國學者的考察，依據三千座古代希臘人的基碑所載，那時人類的平均壽命不過二十歲。在十六世紀時人類的平均壽命也只有二十一歲，十七世紀時的則為二十六歲，至十八世紀時更增至三十四歲，此後人類的平均壽命繼續還有增加。這些事實便鐵一般地證明了人類的壽命是隨着時代的進步而增加的。　　人類的生命是附在康健的肉體上的，並不是飄蕩在渺茫的空中的東西；必要一個人的肉體有較長時間的健康，才能有一個較長的生命繼續存在。但要保持人類肉體的健康，却不是呌人喫齊拜佛，敬神信鬼所能辦到的，那必要社會的衛生設備較完善，醫學較發達才行，因為這才有更多可能防止和解除人的疾病災難。近代人的平均壽命比過去時代人的為長，其原因便在於此。如果把問題移到蘇聯，那便更明顯了。從前俄羅斯人民的平均壽命不過三十二至三十三歲，但自十月革命以後，因為社會制度的根本變更，社會的衛生設備日益進步，一般人的生活逐漸改善久以及科學的特別發達，在一九二六至二七年時，蘇聯人民的平均壽命卽已增加到了四十四至四十五歲；這就是說在那同一的國土內，由於社會的飛躍進步，人類的平均壽命顯示出了十二年的增加。　　科學地研究起來，一般哺乳動物的平均壽命大約為共生長期間的五倍；依據這個來推算，則人類的成長時間是二十一年，便有活到一百零五歲的可能。據蘇聯梅基尼可夫的論斷，人類可以活到百二十歲！而最近逝世的世界生物學者鮑羅夫教授亦曾自信它可以活動到一百歲。事實上，隨着時代的進步，科學的發達，人類確有更長時間的活動之可能。　　但是，不管怎樣，人類的壽命畢竟有限，「老」與「死」乃是人類不可避免的命運。同時因為「老」便是年長的表現，所以一國人民的平均壽命愈大，他們中的年老者也必然愈多。如上述的蘇聯，因為人民平均壽命的增加，六十歲以上的老人便要佔全人口的百分之六乃至七。於是這里發生了一個問題，卽是老年人多的國家，它的國勢是否要衰弱些　　一般人常把一老年」與「老耄」，「衰老」，「老弱」混同，其實這完全是不同的現象。因為「老年」是人類生存過程中的一個階叚，它與少年壯年並立；所謂「老」不一定就是「衰」，「弱」，「健全的老年時期」與「健全的少年時期」及「健全的壯年時期」，對於一個人的成就幾乎可說具有同樣的意義。事實上有許多偉大人物的偉大事業，往往是在老年時期還在繼績，甚至是在老年時期才完成的。如歌德在八十歲時完成「浮士德」；加列略在已成為盲者的七十四歲時，還在努力研究機械類，對於科學提供了許多寶貴的意見；最近逝世的高爾基在其老年時期中也繼續有偉大成就出現；此外八十三幾時的雨果，八十四幾時的福爾特爾，八十五歲時的牛頓，八十八歲時的托爾斯泰，七十五幾時　的因格爾士，都還在繼續其各自一生的活動，而且對於人類社會都有偉大的供獻。　　一個人對於社會的功過不在於他是少年或老年，而是要由他對社會的貢獻來决定。一個靑春年少的摩登靑年，如寓言德國的現狀  珍譯　　有三個動物：牝牛，狗和驢子决定離開瑞士，想到德國去試一試運氣。　　只過了一天，牝牛就回家了，牠説：「我再也不能忍受了。他們没有牛酪，而且還整天不停地擠我的乳水。」　　二十四小時剛過去，那隻狗也回來了，牠説：「德國對於我是不適宜的。在那裏，連想呌一聲都不可能。祗有希特勒有權可以大放厥辭。」　　祇有驢子留在那裏，牠做了宣傳部長。</p>

<p>果他一天到晚只是嫖賭喫着，抽大烟，打嗎啡針，只是努力於無限的消費，那他便是對社會無益有害的廢物；反之，一個老年人，如果他還在為社會工作，繼續將他的一切供獻於社會，那他對社會的益處也是和那些為人類社會努力的少年人一樣的。因此，我們不能一見某一國家人民平均壽命增加，因而多壽命較高的老年人，便謂它的國勢必然衰弱；反之，它的人民平均壽命的增加，「健全的老年人」的日多，倒是表現其社會進步的。而蘇聯的情形就是這樣，但你能說蘇聯的國勢衰弱，社會退後嗎？中國人民的平均壽命，因為近年來的天災人禍，死亡率，特別是兒童的死亡率的增加，所以要算是最短的，在中國社會中老年人也較少，但你能說中國的國勢很强，社會很進步嗎？名人訪問記郁逹夫做官後談鬼  邊模　　提起「郁達夫」，大家都知道他是往年名震全國文藝界的創造社三傑之一。他會經用一支生花妙筆傾倒過無數愛好文藝的靑年們。但時代的怒潮不知浪淘了多少英雄！我們這位向來行踪不定，南北飄泊的郁先生，最近據說是做了官了（？）。這消息是很使多數人關心的。很巧的一個機會，在不久以前，郁先生為了就任幽默刊物「論語」的編輯，到上海來過一趟，恰好與記者在一個宴會中同席。見他仍然是穿着一件半舊的長衫，中國式圓頭鞋，搖搖擺擺，滿口杭州鄉音的郁先生。　　在席間，我聽見郁先生和他一兩位老友的談話，使我想起了老友金岳的一首詩：「好把朱唐當酒杯，人生何事嘆灰頹？君看歲月如流水，流去蒼生總不回！」生活的銷鍊似乎也把當年文思奔放情致沸騰的郁元生束縛得異常馴伏了！　　「郁先生做官的興趣如何？」我問。　　「甚麽官？」郁先生微笑着吾認似的：「這不通是文墨生涯，友誼情商的事。為了生活飄泊多年的人，能够不奔波而可以維持衣食的事也是做做的好。」　　「郁先生的官職可以告訴我嗎？」　　「起初是省政府閒散的參議；以後是主持公報處事務。」　　「管的甚麽事情呢？」　　「省政府的公報與整理全省各地方消息的事」　　「那這對於您這位寫實作家是可以得到不少村料了？」　　「也許可以的罷？」郁先生向我望了望：「我今天聽到您對於我用「寫實作家」四個字很感到高典！「作家」不敢當！而况我是常被人在這上面加上「頹廢派」三字的。但「寫實」到的確是我向來一貫的作風。我的環境，我的經歷，我的戀愛，我的處世，全可由我自己的記錄中很坦白地告訴大家！譬如目前的在政界作事，也只是我的寫實生活而已！」　　「郁先生旣然很注重寫實，為甚麽現在您所主編的論語要出一個「鬼故事」專號呢？」　　「這是為了論語這刊物，銷路很廣，編輯的責任根大，探用材料要為大衆着想。想來想去，覺得「鬼」是人人常談，個個注意的事，但易談而不易精，又向來沒有人肯集中起來各抒所見。反而往往弄得鬼話連篇，鬼影憧憧，不可捉摸。所以不如痛痛快快，大家公開地分析詳明，透透澈澈地叙述見聞，倒是一椿好事。」　　「郁先生對於「鬼的故事」有何高見呢？」　　「雖然科學昌明，但人們沒有發見明瞭的事件還是很多。「鬼」當然也是一椿値得追根究底的事。世間有不少科學家正在不憚艱辛地研究着，我們只好靜聽好音！至於我個人的私見，則覺得這一世間頗有人鬼不分之概，不得已，我們只好把世間分為「活鬼」「死鬼」兩類。在我理想中，以為活鬼一類可說是屬於行動自如的鬼；死鬼一類則是僅能思想，不能行動自如的鬼。但目前，對於行動自如又有思想的活鬼，反而人人不怕；對於僅能思想毫無動作的死鬼，則反而人人要怕，個個提防，眞有點出我意料之外。」　　「郁先生這話是用幽默口吻在諷刺這人鬼不分的社會吧？」我自以為是地說。　　「如果含有諷刺，那我要把現在的活鬼比作僵尸了！因為在大家所傳說或直覺出來的鬼，有不少還是帶點嫵媚或斯文氣象；至於僵尸，那簡直是凶殘如虎狼，强暴如瘋狗的東西！　　「如此說來，現在很多人眞比鬼可怕了？」　　「不，我是說人鬼不分的世間，有一種僵尸最可怕！」「　　「我們能够防備牠嗎？」我也若有所悟地問。　　「雖然我們現在或者還沒有碰見過僵尸，但僵尸隨處都有，那個時候碰見也沒有一定！實在是無法防備！」　　「那豈不是要使人常常毛髮悚然嗎？」　　「誰不是這樣呢？所以我們這時候人人都會覺得日子難過！」　　接着郁先生哈哈地笑了起來。　　這時，我又想起了一椿事來問郁先生：　　「現在的官都要穿制服，郁先生在福建辦公時候穿不穿呢？」　　「隨鄉入鄉，我又豈能例外？而况短打衣服也已做好，不日回去，自然也要穿將起來。回想二十餘年來，大半日子是長袍甩甩，一旦穿起短裝，或者會感到渾身不舒服也說不定。」　　「我對於郁先生又要講幾句胃昧話了！」我說；「我聽說郁先生在我國作家中是版稅很可觀的一位，而且在杭州還自己建造得有洋房子。為什麽會為了生活而使自己受不少拘束呢？」　　「人事滄桑，眞使人感慨係之！版稅在我國出版界中很少保障，我本人也是吃虧之一員。比方，我以前在「現代」出書較多，「光華」也有，但這兩處而今安在？」　　隨後，邵洵美詩人又告訴我，映霞夫人仍住杭州，達夫先生隻身在閩。論語的編輯事務，則是由邵郁兩人時常通信討論，如郁先生在上海時一樣。並且，洵美又向我說：「達夫自己的寫實被人家誤解為頹廢地學了去，學的人自己倒的確成了頹廢派了，您以為如何？」　　我點點頭。　　那天的宴會，大家都還感到興趣，因為所討論的題目很好玩：一是「做官」，一是講「鬼」。不過大家都沒有把「官」同「鬼」混為一談！哲學講座內因與外因  樂炳　　宇宙中的事物，不但從外表上去看，都是單個單個擺在那裹的，並且這些單個的事物還都在運動，都在採取各別的方式在運動。可是，如果不談運動則已，一要談運動，那些運動就是有原因的。因為不但運動自身就形成繼起的事象是以先在的事象為條件那種前因後果的連繫，而且一切運動總有其所以生起這運動之先行的根由，就是說有其原因。這不管是機械的力學的運動也好，亦不管是發展的性質運動也好，都是一樣。宇宙間是沒有無原因的運動的。因為一切事物的運動都是有原因的，所以認識這作為運動的根源的原因，在哲學上也是一個重要問題，所謂內因論與外因論也是這種認識問題之一。　　在哲學上有外因論和內因論兩派不同的親點。在外因論者看來，事物的運動完全只以外因為原因和根據，事物自身是沒有運動的，也沒有運動的自己的根據。一切運動只是外在於事物之某種力的作用的結果，事物完全處於被動的地位受這外加的力的支配而運動。這種外因論是單純的外因論者，並且在這種外因論上亦有兩種不同的說法。第一種外因論是宗教信仰上所主張的，他們把宇宙萬物當作是神的力在背後發生作用，受神的加力事物才能變化。事物自己是不能自主地變化運動的，因為它沒有自動的原因。比如說，在封建社會裹，那些專制的帝王之興起和其朝代的盛衰存亡，在舊的傳統思想上都把它歸之於天命的。天意耍眷類到某一姓氏或個人，他才能得天下，當其喪失了天眷時，便會失掉天下。下如一般迷信冥冥中有神明主宰的人都常說『生死有命，富貴在天』，這是說他們把人之窮通生死的變化當作是有神　在那裹支配着的。就是風，雲，雷，雨的變化罷，也不是這自然物自己在那裹運動變化而是有這些神在背後作法。這種外因論是最古老而又最落後的，至今在落後的民衆中尚保存着這種宇宙觀。另外一種是機械的外因論者，它雖然比較科學，却同樣認事物的運動只是外在於它的旁的自然力之加力作用，才能使這事物發生運動與變化。事物自己是沒有發展的性質的性質變化的，或者說他們只看見那種由外的加力而生起的位置運動，看不見事物自身的性質變化。這種外因論是十八世紀以前的自然科學和哲學的觀點，在牛頓的力學上就是如此，他只看見物質之機械的力學的位置運動，却沒有看見物質之進化的歷史發展那種質的變化的運動。同時，從當時的自然科學之機械觀，也發展成為十八世紀的機械唯物哲學，這種哲學歸根到底一樣是外因論的哲學。　　和外因論相對立的是內因論，它是主張事物的發展主要的靠自己的內在的能動性和所動的根源而運動的，事物以此時時在改變目己的本質。對於外因，他們或者完全加以吾認，或者大半看得很不重要。這種內因論也同樣有兩種大同小異的觀察法。一種是內在目的論者，他們以為每一事物自身就是有自己支配自己的絕對的能力，並且是有目的有計劃的，自己自動地受自己的目的的决定性而推動自己，向那完全的高尚的道路不斷變化發展。當然這發展也是使自己時時變更其性質的，因為它是漸趨完美地向着合於至善的目的而前進的一種運動。另外的一種內因論，雖然它並不如內在目的論那樣顯明地主張目的說，但它同樣是過分輕視外因論，過分高調了內因的作用。他們以為只是內因才是事物發展之决定的作用，縱然有時也有外因的參加，但這外因確是很不重要，是不具有决定的必然作甩的。這種說法在最後的歸宿上，也會變成與內在目的論相類似的結論的，因為外因不能在事物發展上具有决定的必然作用，那麼每一事物的發展都不是宇宙整個的自然法則的必然的作用所支配的結果，這一事物只獨立於客觀的自然法則之外而孤立地决定自己，客觀的必然性與作為主觀看的事物的運動變化是不發生關係的。　　那末，甚麽是科學的內因論與外因論呢？只有辯証地統一了內因與外因之雙方的和交互作用的外因論與內因論的辯証法，才能算是科學的原因論。依正確的辯証法的觀點說來，事物是有發展運動的，這發展運動就是內在的發展，是它自己的質的變化，並且是自己在那裹行其矛盾對立的鬥爭，自己肯定自已又吾定自己。像這樣的運動，不但是有別於僅能外見和顯然要受外加的力學的力的作用之空間運動，而且自己的質的變化卽是自我的改變，自己的那種對立矛盾與肯定吾定，也正是表示着自己在運動。特別是自己的矛盾對立，乃是作為自已的發展的動力的要因的東西，沒有矛盾對立，則一切發展都成為不可能，一切外因也無所施其作用於它的發展運動。另外，外因要對於事物起其决定的必然的作用，產生使之運動的作用，首先就得事物要有能動性能接受它的作用那種原因。這種現象就在機械遝動上也是一樣，因為車輪如果完全無能動性，外的汽力與電力無論如何也轉動不了它，這是當然的。可是這些自動性和自己表現的運動，因為是自己本身所具有的和體現出來的，所以是內因的，，內內在這裹是具有重耍性和决定的必然性的意義的。不但如此，就外因作用必須要有內因為基礎說，這正證明沒有內因不能使外因在事物運動上發生决定的必然的作用，我們因此可以說，沒有內因就沒有外因在個別事物中存在，外因要轉化為內因才能表於事物之原因中，　　以上接第五版</p>

<p>决定的必然的作用，單談外因之必然的决定作用是不可思議的。　　但是，反過來　，內　就完全可以不靠然因而成立，不靠外因的决定的必然性而有它自己的决定的必然作用，能使事物運動發展嗎？這又不然。因為宇宙是一個整體的統一的，沒有可以離開一切常作外在的事物和環境及其作用看的別的事物而能孤立地存在的事物。旣然這樣事物木身都不存在，那麽說它有純然只受內因决定的必然性的運動，這不是很滑稽嗎？實際上是這樣，事物的內因也是外因所形成和决定的，是外因的作用的結果，外因的决定的必然性亦决定了事物的發展運動，因為它自己會轉變為內因和其决定的必然性的緣故。很顯然的，一事物自然有其自具的能動性，但單靠它的能動性就可運動嗎？並且可以依一定的必然的道路而運動嗎？無機物不在一定的環境下可以演進為生物嗎？如果可能，那麼太陽上應當有生物了。中國的社會卽使有發展成資本主義社會之可能的能動性，但不在十九世紀和廿世紀之此時的世界環境中，也可以自由地發展成資本主義社會或抝抳這道路而不發展資本主義嗎？如果可能，那麼它為甚麼不在秦漢時代就形成資本主義社會，或在今日仍能閉關自守，過自己的自給自足的經濟生產呢？假使我們硬要說這只是為單方面的，自己內在的，可能發展為資本主義的那種能動性所决定的，或只有這是有决定的必然性的作用的，而世界的環境之外因則絕不具有决定的必然性的作用，則我們只有解釋中國也恰在二十世紀發展了微弱的資木家主義，而與整個世界相適應，這乃只能算是一種巧合而已了。雖然我們也不能贊成那單純的外因論而吾認它的內在的可能性，但我們亦不能單純地主張內因的必然决定性，而吾認外因亦具有决定的必然作用。一切事物都有其內在的發展的可能性，有其矛盾對立的自因，有其自己肯定，自己吾定之自我運動，但這一切亦不能，要能發展成為矛盾對立，自己肯定，自已吾定等等，卽要能道樣開始運動，它必須耍受客觀的原因的作用。麥粒變成麥莖，再變成麥粒，雖然它必須具有這種內在的可能，並且是它自已在那裏發展對立，吾定自己，但是，如果沒有雨水季節的適當的外在作用，它也可以成為不能生長，運動的東西啊！我們否定了外因的作用，或者說外因沒有重要性，沒有决定的必然性，那麼每一事物都可以離開它自己的客觀世界，而獨立存在，運動和發展，不但宇宙的統一的作用被分裂了，宇宙成為無聯繫的解體了的單件的雜凑世界，成為沒有統一的法則的東西，而且這些個別事物的運動也將只有用內在目的論去說明了。過於高拾內因論而抑低外因論的作用，它是會和吾認內因論或過於高調外因論那種理論，犯着同一的目的論的錯誤的。　　總之，單一的事物之運動的內因自然是牠運動的動力，機械論者看不見內在的發展運動固然是很錯誤，但宇宙之整個的關聯作用，和其統一地與總和地支配單一事物之發展作用與法則，是絕不可被忽視的，它對於單一事物之發展亦有决定的必然性存在。一切外因是可以而且必然轉化為內因去支配事物的，一切事物之自己的運動的內因，它亦成為宇宙的全體之一部分或一環，以此組成外因而作用於事物，內因以此亦轉化為外因。宇宙是為如此內因和外因之交互作用和辯證的發展所支配的。工商業實踐經營烟紙店經驗談  蒲樸　　我做烟紙店這行生意　快到七八年了，據我這多年來的經騐，又眼看着我們的隣家所開的另外的生意之相繼倒閉，不景氣，我深深知道，我們這種生意是有利可圖的，比其他的一切生意都穩當好做，自然，要怎樣企圖賺一份大資本，那也是不可能的事。我親自看見左隣右舍的生意，有些開到五六年不倒閉，不換老闆的，也就萬分徼倖了，大半都是今日一大廉價，明日一關門大拍賣。只有我們烟紙店從來沒打過廉價的旗子，不管春季和秋季，都有經常的主顧，决沒有過無人過問，門可羅雀的景况。買主向我們所買的東西雖不多，我們從每一個顧客身上一决雖賺不了多少錢，但是積少成多，也就滿可維持了，除了開支，多少總是有剩餘的。所以我對於烟紙店生意，越做得久便越有把握，越有興趣，雖有另外比這更高貴的還能暴發富的生意，我也許都不想去做吧。　　我們的烟紙店也搬過一决家。原因是開烟紙店首要注意的是地址問題。如在全是公共建築物林立的地方，在住家稀少，人口不密的地方，或者不當交通要道的地方，生意總是不大好的。你總要在那電車交錯如網的車站附近，或選擇居民甚多的大的弄堂總衖門口來開店舖。至於專門是發財入的住宅周圍，那也沒多少生意可做的。因為他們的人數很少，需用零物不多，而且他們所需要的東西都是高貴的，他們儘可以坐汽車到大百貨商店去訂購，不會到你小烟紙店來照顧生意。所以我們烟紙店根本就是接近中小階層的市民的商店。大馬路不是我們能立足的地方，愚園路也不適宜，我們只有選擇小菜塲的附近，北四川路左右一帶是頂適宜不過的了。在法租界偏西一帶，生意也不好做，我們從前就是從法界搬到北四川路來的。　　烟紙店頂重要的生意是兌換洋錢角子。兌換有兩種：一種是入家拿整的來，我們給他換成零的，如鈔票換成角子，角子換成銅板。第二種是由零換整，這是很少有顧客這樣做的，不過間或也有，所以我們每天所換得的銅板角子是必需向「錢市」換成鈔票的，不然你就無法應主顧的需要了。兌換的利很原。如果你每天能兌換上大洋百枚的話，那起碼也能賺一元到二元。因為人家來換一元的角子，你總可以净得三個銅板的剩餘，人家來換一個角子，你至少可净得一一個銅板，自然，人家來換五元或十元的鈔票，你也同樣只能取三個銅板或五個銅板，但平均下來，每日元錢至少是可賺一塊多錢的。這就呌做「錢滾錢」，只要有一百元的本錢，每天就有一元多錢的利息，這樣的生意你又到那裹去找呢？允其在頂熱鬧的街道，每一個雙角你可以賺到四個銅板，但在偏僻小巷你是不能這樣做的，因為那都是些中小市民，不願受這損失的。近來法幣通行，雙角漸少，這對於我們的兌換也是一個莫大的打擊，新輔幣在電車上十足通用，在我們却反而要扣賺十文，所以人家也不來兌換了。兌換雖然賺錢，但是責任也很大，如果你認錯了一個角子，那你就是做到幾塊錢的生意也賺不出來，如認錯了一元或幾元一張的鈔票，那你就眞倒霉了，所以認識鈔票和洋錢與輔幣之眞偽，也是我們重要的必具的本領之一。　　除了做兌換外，就是賣紙烟。紙烟生意的利息也很大，普通項起碼也可賺一個銅板一包，如美麗牌以上的價錢的香烟，那就起碼有二個銅板好賺。紙烟要各色俱全，下自公司牌，强盜牌，上至美麗牌，白金龍，幾乎缺一不可，但再高的價錢的，如Capston　之類的外國香烟，那你頂好不辦，就辦，也不宜多，因為到烟紙店來買香烟的都是普通的小市民，價錢大的東西，人家可以到大公司去買的。還有頂壞的紙烟如一個銅板一支的小仙女牌或中南牌等香烟也得多多預備，因為有許多貧民如黃包車夫之類，他們只能購買這種東西的。　　除了香烟而外，應辦的貨品多得很如肥皂，草紙，各種糖果，餅乾，各種炒熟了的豆子，酒，醬油，鹽巴，小至於一針一線，以及學生用的鉛筆，墨硯，信封箋，郵票等等，計算起來，大大小小起碼也有二百種以上。你要應有盡有，才能做到有求必應，不然，你一次不能供給人家的零星需要，人家下次便不來照顧你的生意了，不怕就是你備辦得有的東西。有些物品你明知是賣不了多少的，或甚至始終不能賣出，永久當作「陳貨」放起來，但是你也得備辦；有些東西，你明知是賺不了錢，或甚至會失本的，但你也不能不預備。因為這樣才能獲得人家的信仰和歡心。在某些物品上貼的本，在旁的物品上可以賺回來而有餘的，做生意决不可固執一隅，允其是我們這開雜貨店的小生意。　　以上是略略就對待主顧的情形而言。就內部說，我們這生意利息是厚，穩是穩當，但是生活的確也很苦。從早上五點多鐘起，直至夜間十二時止，你都要輪流招呼顧主。在早上和晚上生意稀少時，你得去添購貨品和兌換鈔票，在夜深了，你還得淸數銅板，淸結賬目。一個銅板兩個銅板的生意，你是不能每一件每一件都去登記賬目的，都是把取得的錢拋到一個櫃子裹去，每天有個總結就是了。也不能精確地估計那一項東西究竟有多少盈餘，因為都是裏在一起的緣故。這樣一來，店裹的先生和學徒就非得是都忠於事務不可的了，大家都得「同舟共濟」。不然，要舞弊也很容易，而且這是沒法處處來加以淸查監督的。如果老闆對待得好，使人們都樂為己用，那就對了。好在開烟紙店的老闆，他本身本來也只是一個店員，並不像那些大公司的經理那樣的。言論從「七孀婦控告工部局」說起  國　　最近報載：「五月十二日上午的四時，楊樹浦路有汽車一輛駛入浦江中，致溺斃七命。今此七人之孀婦已請羅傑律師代表向領事法庭起訴控告工部局；略謂因工部局築路後設備不周，使駕車行於此路者不知有極端危險在，故其地已成一死穽，肇禍已不止一次矣！此次肇禍，罹禍者達七人之多；每人皆有家屬，生活教育等費完全賴之，工部局責無旁貸，應賠償死者家屬之損失：各人所要求之數多寡不同，其總數共為十八萬八千七百三十四元。……」這件引人注意的訟案，領事法庭自可依法裁判，我們未便有所議論。不過由此却使我們想到了上海的許多市政問題，打算借着這個機會把它提出來討論一下，以供獻於市政當局及一般市民之前。　　上海是中國工商業薈萃之區，是我們的最大都市，但牠的市政與世界其他各大都市比較起來，却是差得很遠的。如巴黎，倫敦，紐的等大都市，不管住在那裹的一般市民的生活是怎樣不同，不管那裹有好多饑餓的人民在終日呻吟，但那些地方的市政却在日益改善，一般市民在那些地方的一般行動也比較安全舒適，像汽車肇禍，水兵酒醉打人，火警……等事固然很少，就是出外乘車也要便利得多。但上海的市政却使人未能感到有所進步；我們在上海住了十多年，覺得一切市政的設施並未有所變更，電車，公共汽車，馬路……等可說都和過去一樣。　　先拿電車來說吧，雖然有過幾决的電車加價，但電車的形式和設備還是仍舊，車輛也沒有增加多少，電車路綫更沒有新的建築。如由滬西到法租界簡直沒有電車往來，一般往來於這條路綫的市民，比較有錢者還可以坐坐黃包車，至於無力坐黃包車的，便只有拉長兩條腿來步行了！以這樣大這樣「文明」的都市，在交通方面竟這樣的不便，這不能不說是一個大缺點。又如因為電車數量之少與設備的不完善，使人坐在電車上如被關在猪籠內一樣，覺得頭昏氣悶，很不舒適；就中允其是由曹家渡到民國路，由昆明路到大世界的無軌電車，乘客更是常常擁擠得不堪。為什麽不多增幾輛車呢？為什麽不把電車設備得好一點呢？未必住在租界內的半殖民地的中國人民應該受那種待遇罷？　　其次如各交通要道的紅燈，本來是用來維持交通秩序的；為了一般市民的利益，它的開關時間長短必有一定，不能把某一面的綠燈開得太久，也不能讓另一面的紅燈老是開下去。但是，假使你坐着黃包車或電車行抵一個十字路口時，往往會因由橫面馬路上遠遠地傳來一陣嗚嗚的汽車聲，而為當面的紅燈出現阻止了你的前進，使你死等在那十字路口上；，有時候甚至因為橫面來往的汽車太多，川流不息的跑來跑去，當面的紅燈老是開着，使你好久不能前進。還有，我們在馬路上常常遇見有幾列電車停在十字路口上，只聽見司機人急躁地噹噹的響着脚鈴，却不見電車行動：這是什麽原因呢？這是因為橫面來往的汽車尚未過完，電車道上老現着紅燈，所以那些電車不得過去。像這樣的情形，常會使人覺得馬路上紅綠燈好像是專為乘汽車的大老之便利而設似的。　　總之，我們希望市政當局此後對於市政的改善能多多注意，能逐漸在事實上補救所有的缺陷，至少也耍使如七孀婦控告工部局那類的情形不再發生纔好。文藝作品後樓日記（四）  叔羽　　下午，我又往吉先生那裹跑了一次。我把我唯一的希望　於他的身上，而這個墓督教社會主義者，也似乎比一般的基督徒較富於同情心。他說：「你的事我已向經理說過幾决。他起先說是好的，後來又說是緩一緩再談，究竟如何，也還沒有明白的表示。」我的心沈了下來，覺得這事非一時所能成功，不過還沒有陷到完全失望的地步。　　在回來的路上，我遇到一隊預備去擋砲火的人，形容枯搞，鶉衣百結，為狀至為可憐。有的手裹提着包袱，有的背着藍布的袋子，裹面都是塞得滿滿的，更有的是兩手空空，一無所有。他們一個個垂頭喪氣地，沈默地向前走着，腳步是沉重的，像是有一種什麼厭力臨到他們頭上。使他們有些不勝其負担的樣子。無疑地，這些人是一樣地有生活的鞭子在他們的背上猛抽着，而同時，在另一個地方，也有和他們同命運的一羣人在等待與他們廝殺。固然，在這些人中間也是一兩個是趾高氣揚，精神飽滿，聳着眉，昻着首的。但這是因為他們心中正燃着一團希望之火，他們是未來的有槍階級者，他們幻想着將來或許還能從槍林彈雨中殺出一條血路。真的，這個念頭比「殺」這一件事再痛快是沒有的了：殺人，被殺或自殺。卽使你不殺人，別人也要來殺你；卽使你不自殺，生活也要來殺你。那那些剝削者甚至可以不用絞架，也不用毒氣，而把一城的人殺死。　　有一個兵士領着這一羣可憐的人前行，手裹擎舉着一幅招兵的小旗，這旗已蒙上一層污濁的灰色，顯然不是新製的，大概已用了徂多次，陰森森的仿佛是秋日的招魂之幡。唉！這就是生活的影子，牠現在正牽着這一羣柔弱的綿羊進入屠塲！生活是最自私的，牠是不惜把這些有如無價之寶的生命作孤注之一擲的。　　今天不知怎的，這一羣人特別引起我的注意，而我對於他們也深表同情。我覺得悲慘，我下着淚，我欲入山為僧。（未完）　　啓事　網，錫榮，瑚，凌仙，利生，西門，玉瑎女士，炭工，叔羽，靑軍，微全，璣，諸君公鑒：六月份承惠賜大作，曷勝感紉！稿費業已結算淸楚，請於每月六日至十日，十六日至二十日（星期日除外），每日下午二時至四時，具條蓋章，向本館會計處領取為荷！（申報業餘周刊編輯部謹啟）播音節目　　上海市（九〇〇）每日節目　　上午　　一一·四五　愛國音樂（黨歌，新生活，漁陽鼓，樂羣歌，雪恥歌）　　一二·〇〇　報時　氣象　新聞　西樂　　下午　　一·○○　休息　　四·一五　大鼓（單刀會，烏龍院）　　四·三○　中華口琴會口琴（一）卡爾王進行曲（二）長想思（三）漁父之歌（四）Antontinople（五）去來今，龍羽鳳舞　　五·○○　教育節目（防空常識）　　五·三○　平劇（連營寨，哭靈牌·空城計·駡殿·打漁殺家·祭瀘江·四進士·梅妃）　　六·○○　一週内重要新聞　歌唱（大路歌，開路先鋒，中華之光，旗正飄飄，神女摇船歌）　　六·三○　新聞　氣象　國際貿易介紹消息　　六·五○　平劇（打棍出箱·桑園寄子·二進宫·惡虎村·拿高登·戰宛城·梅龍鎮）　　七·○○　平劇（國劇研究社）　　九·○五　預報明日節目　平劇　　九·三○　停止</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, the Chief of General Staff Cheng Qian, and others jointly sent a telegram to Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others on [the 26th], various military and political leaders of the provinces have telegraphed to Beijing, expressing unanimous support for He and Cheng's proposal. It is reported that Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi, upon receiving He and others' [26th] telegram, replied with a telegram. He and Cheng then sent another telegram on the 2nd, advising Chen and others to personally attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Beijing or send responsible generals to Beijing immediately to discuss important matters. The original text of the previous telegram was also sent to the directors of the pacification zones, the chairmen of the provincial governments, and the commanders of the armies and divisions for their information. The original text of the previous telegram is extracted below: [Addressed to] The Directors of Pacification Zones, The Chairmen of Provincial Governments, The Mayors, The Commanders-in-Chief, The Army Commanders, The Division Commanders: We have received the telegram from Benan, Delin, Jiansheng, and others on the 30th [of the previous month]. [The telegram states] that they have repeatedly requested the central government to lead the way and have designated the routes and gathering points for going north. It is not that they are disobeying their superiors or disrespecting the government. As for the statement that Guangdong and Guangxi will become the continuation of the four northeastern provinces, the Japanese invaders have not yet invaded the south. In Guangdong, we can say that everything is peaceful. Even if Japanese troops suddenly arrive, Guangdong and Guangxi will swear to defend the revolutionary base established by our leader and the martyrs with iron and blood, refusing to cede an inch of land. We are requesting the central government to lead the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, which is precisely to promote the unity of the whole country. Yet, people consider it as separation. Whoever falls into the trap should pull themselves out. A moment of thought can lead to eternal regret. Your words are good. The telegram also stated that national salvation requires the wisdom of the whole nation and should be shared with the people. We replied with a telegram on the 2nd, which reads: We have received your telegram on the 30th. Our previous telegram was sincere in every word, but we are deeply ashamed that it was not accepted. Today, the country is in such danger. Who with blood and Qi does not take saving the nation as their responsibility? However, since it is called saving the nation, it is of great importance to the future of the nation and the race. Every action must be based on the overall consideration of the entire nation and race, and no individual is allowed to act alone and disrupt the pace. We must unite sincerely and uphold the hard-won peace and unity, and no individual is allowed to undermine it and give others an opportunity to take advantage of. After carefully reading your telegram, one says that you have repeatedly requested the central government to lead the way and that you are not disobeying your superiors or disrespecting the government. Another says that you are requesting the central government to lead the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, which is precisely to promote the unity of the whole country. Finally, it is stated that national salvation requires the wisdom of the whole nation and should be shared with the people. We have read it again and again and are deeply gratified. These are precisely what the central government is striving for today. We hope that the local authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi will be consistent in their words and actions and truly implement them. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is not far away. If you can find time to come north to attend and share your plans for national salvation, we would be overjoyed. If you are bound by your duties and cannot leave, please send responsible generals to Beijing immediately to discuss the important matters. The future of the party and the country depends on you. We offer our sincere reply and await your instructions. [Signed] He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Tiaoyuan (4th Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) In recent days, when the No. 305 train heading south on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway arrived at the East Station, the Ronin Smuggling Trade Association immediately moved sugar, rayon, cigarette paper, and other goods to the platform. Dozens of people were divided into three groups, responsible for expelling passengers, transporting goods, and intimidating railway officials. Many passengers were unable to get off the train because the carriages were blocked. The situation was extremely chaotic. The Beining Railway, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, has instructed all station personnel to pay close attention to anti-smuggling measures. If the environment permits, they should assist in anti-smuggling and be vigilant at all times, and there should be no collusion. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Pacific Situation and China <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Let's stop craning our necks looking for help from other countries. The facts have already told us that after several years of turmoil, the Washington Treaty, which laid the foundation for the post-World War I Pacific situation, and the Nine-Power Treaty, which maintained China's territorial integrity, have been abandoned like "a rotten cabbage" by the country that has made aggression its national policy. This not only throws the Pacific situation off balance but also deals a fatal blow to the United States' East Asian foreign policy over the past century. The Democratic Party's foreign policy, which has been in charge of the US government for the past four years, has remained silent on East Asian issues. What exactly are they selling in their gourd? At least for now, we cannot know for sure. It seems that the United States' Open Door Policy towards China has been changed. It seems that the United States' principle of not recognizing territory acquired by force has come to an end. It seems that the meaning of the Kellogg-Briand Pact has become a mere formality. With the passage of the new Neutrality Act, the United States has retreated to its traditional isolationism as it did after World War I, ignoring affairs outside the Americas and even becoming very passive about events in East Asia. We have seen the United States abandon the Philippines and allow it to become independent. We have seen that after the passage of the new Neutrality Act, American public opinion believes that this is not thorough enough. We have seen many American political commentators believe that to take China back from Japan, it would require sacrificing one million young people, fifty billion US dollars, and fifteen hundred years of trade to recoup these losses. We know that neither the ruling leaders nor the general public are willing to make sacrifices for the dignity of paper treaties that have no direct bearing on their interests. Therefore, as the presidential election year approaches, we can see from the foreign policy platforms of the two largest parties in the United States, the Democratic and Republican parties, that they are united in maintaining isolationism and avoiding entanglement in other countries' affairs. The Democratic Party's platform advocates continuing President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy, maintaining neutrality in other countries' disputes, and preventing involvement in any war in international trade or private trade. Although the campaign platform also has a clause reaffirming the purpose of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it seems to be nothing more than a superficial decoration and is not of any real importance. The Republican Party's campaign platform for foreign policy is even more straightforward, stating that the United States will not conclude any alliances or make any political promises. Even the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which was created by the Republican Party, is not mentioned at all. It seems that the United States' East Asian foreign policy has changed. However, has the essence of American foreign policy really changed so dramatically? In fact, no matter how silent the United States remains, no matter how afraid of war the American people are, the United States cannot ignore European affairs and also be willing to stay out of Pacific affairs. Even the Republican Party under Hoover, with its isolationist policy as its foundation, expressed its willingness to cooperate with the League of Nations to deal with Japan over the Manchurian Incident through then-Secretary of State Stimson. How can we believe that the Democratic Party, which inherited Wilson's mantle, has completely broken with the past and completely retreated from East Asia? The current lack of clear expression is perhaps a campaign strategy to cater to the psychology of the domestic public. We know that after Roosevelt won the last election, he criticized President Hoover, but he maintained a very close relationship with Stimson. Before taking office, he consulted Stimson. Roosevelt's foreign policy over the past four years, as some have said, has followed the old tricks of Theodore Roosevelt, "carrying heavy battleships while walking with light steps." That is, maintaining silence on the surface while secretly preparing for military action. What is the purpose of Roosevelt's large-scale naval policy? Its target is self-evident. There are two other things that can prove that American leaders have not forgotten the Pacific. One is that the US Pacific air route is operated by Pan American Airways, departing from San Francisco and crossing the Pacific to the Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia, and other places. It has also incorporated Jarvis, Baker, and Howland Islands into American territory for use as air stations between Hawaii and Australia. Recently, a powerful air force base has been built near Fairbanks in Alaska. Those who know understand that this aviation enterprise, placed under the control of the military, is not solely for transportation. The second is that after Japan declared its withdrawal from the naval conference, the United States immediately expanded its naval bases in the Pacific territories. It not only strengthened the facilities of its naval ports in Samoa, Guam, and Alaska, but also strengthened the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii as its center. It has also given the Philippines, which it allowed to become independent, sufficient strength. All of this is enough to prove that the United States is not willing to withdraw from the Pacific unconditionally and be relegated to a supporting role. Therefore, some people say that the United States' decision on peace and war will only be clear after the next presidential election. This observation has considerable merit.</p>
<p>What is currently unknowable is the attitude of the United Kingdom. In 1931, the United States was very concerned about the China issue, while the United Kingdom turned a deaf ear and secretly sent overtures to Japan. Now that Japan's power has a trend of dominating East Asia, the United Kingdom is very anxious, while the United States is very indifferent. The reason for this indifference is also due to the United Kingdom's short-sighted diplomacy, which still lacks a consistent policy and a clear banner. Leaving aside the UK's East Asian foreign policy, even in the period from the time Ross came to China until recently when Ross returned home, it was still trying to preserve its vested interests in China under Japan's mercy. We saw that before Ross came to China, he first went to Japan to seek Japan's mercy, and when he was about to return home, he went to Japan again to seek its mercy. He repeatedly ran into obstacles and returned to England. He then advised China in a non-committal tone to reduce tariffs in order to secretly please Japan. Some short-sighted people in China also echoed this view, saying that they should not be bound by prejudices and should carefully weigh the pros and cons. If it is possible to increase financial revenue to supplement the budget, it may be possible to reduce tax rates to suit the environment. This view is the same mistake as the view that China can be peaceful if it loses the Northeast and Rehe. We know that our allies' secret support for smuggling, encouragement of smuggling, and protection of smuggling have their consistent purpose, which is to cause China's finances to collapse and have no power to fight. Therefore, it will never automatically prohibit smuggling by reducing tariffs. At the same time, we will never increase revenue by reducing tariffs. Our guest's view may seek the effect of good relations for his own country, but it is feared that it is not worth a smile for our country. Therefore, for our own sake, under the current situation, we can only rely on our own strength to overcome all the national crises we encounter. The United States is our friend, at least it is still powerless for now. The United Kingdom is our friend, but its consideration of its own interests far outweighs its consideration of our own interests. Then, what kind of determination should China have? What kind of goals should it have? Which path should it take? It should be clear in its mind.</p>
<h3 id="e10">National Economy - Establishment of the Construction Movement Committee - Chairman Chiang Presides and Delivers Instructions - Wu Dingchang Reports on Preparatory Progress <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Construction Movement Committee was formally established on the 4th. The inaugural meeting was held at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the Ministry of Industries. Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Committee Member Chiang Song Meiling, arrived at 8:50 AM to attend. Despite the drizzling rain, the participation of various committee members and specialists was extremely enthusiastic. Over two hundred people attended, including Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Niu Yongjian, He Yingqin, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Weizhi, Li Liejun, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Cheng Qian, Weng Wenhao, Jiang Tingfu, Zhang Daofan, Chen Jie, Chen Jiliang, Chen Xun, Bing, Zou Lin, Xu Kan, Wu Dingchang, Zhou Yichun, Wang Shijie, Peng Xuepei, Shi Ying, Wang Yongbin, Mao Zuquan, Chen Shuren, Qin Fen, and Chu Minyi. Chairman Chiang presided over the meeting. After the ceremonial proceedings, Chiang delivered a speech. Chief Preparatory Committee Member Wu Dingchang then gave a detailed report on the preparatory work. At the end, he also expressed his personal thoughts on national economic construction, believing that in the proactive aspect, various important undertakings should be constructed. On the passive side, it could start from clothing, food, housing and action. The committee's affairs are extremely broad and require the concerted efforts of all members to lay the foundation for success. The importance of the National Economic Construction Movement to China's economy is extremely evident. Currently, there is a vast difference between China's desire for economic self-sufficiency and the reality. Regarding food, China only produces 960 million piculs of rice, 420 million piculs of wheat, and several million piculs of miscellaneous grains annually. Imports include 12 million piculs of rice, over 5 million piculs of wheat, and 500,000 piculs of flour. According to experts, China's food supply, even including imports, is still short by one-tenth, meaning that 40 million people do not have enough to eat. Regarding clothing, China only produces over 9 million piculs of cotton annually, with imports of 4 million piculs, which is still insufficient even when averaged. Regarding housing, the wood, cement, and steel used in new construction in recent years have all been imported. Except for cement, which is self-sufficient, timber imports reach 30 million yuan annually, and even combined with the national population, it is still insufficient. Therefore, a portion of the Chinese population must be lacking in food, clothing, and shelter. However, it is precisely this group of hardworking and resilient people upon whom Chinese society relies for its maintenance. When we look at the five-year plans of the Soviet Union, there isn't really anything mysterious about them. Eat less, wear less, live less, and use the rest to exchange for foreign production machinery. Although China cannot completely imitate this, everyone should at least economize on clothing, food, and housing, prioritize domestic goods over foreign imports and consumer goods. In short, the National Economic Construction Movement requires people to first practice thrift in clothing, food, and housing in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Afterwards, President Sun delivered a speech, briefly stating that Chairman Chiang had already provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the National Economic Construction Movement, and the Chief Preparatory Committee Member had also given a detailed report on the current state of China's economy. Foreigners often say that the Chinese lack organizational skills and that when a movement is initiated and an organization is established, everyone is full of enthusiasm, but after the organization is established, there is no further activity, as if the mission has already been accomplished. Now that this committee has been established, all members should recognize the crisis facing the nation and lead the people of the country to implement the plan item by item, so that the people can obtain appropriate benefits and the nation can achieve stability. This would not betray the good intentions of the Chairman and the responsibility for the revival of the nation. After the speech, Standing Committee Member Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, briefly stating that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution was based on the Three Principles of the People, with the Principle of People's Livelihood as the center. The economic panic is not only a serious problem for China today, but also a common suffering for countries around the world in the 20th century. Moreover, reforms in past dynasties and societies have often arisen from economic issues. "Recently, international aggressions and conflicts have all been caused by economic problems. Experts in Europe and the United States have studied this issue extensively, but have ultimately failed to resolve it. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, amidst his busy military schedule, initiated the National Economic Construction Movement in Guizhou last year, as he was aware of the real situation of China's economic distress and had a way to provide relief. While some people in China feel they lack sufficient clothing, food, and housing, there are also some people in major cities who spend and waste resources every day. China's annual trade deficit is 7-800 million yuan. If each of China's 400 million people produces one yuan more and consumes one yuan less each year, then this serious trade deficit problem can be resolved. Today's establishment of this committee coincides with American Independence Day. We can call today China's Economic Independence Day. As one of the Standing Committee Members, I welcome the guidance of all members so that the committee's work can flourish and not betray the good intentions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and also prove that the Three Principles of the People are indeed the doctrine for saving the country and the people." Kong finished his speech and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. (4th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Assembly of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee held its inaugural meeting on the 4th. Chairman Chiang delivered an address, stating that since he initiated the National Economic Construction Movement in Guizhou last March, people throughout the country have recognized that to save China's economic crisis, it is necessary to awaken the common awareness and united efforts of the people. They have generally agreed that this movement is an urgent matter for the revival of the nation and have embraced it with passionate sympathy, initiating and advocating for it, or working on theoretical and methodological research, or engaging in oral and written publicity. All sectors of the academic and economic communities across the country have also attached great importance to this initiative and are willing to work together to promote its success. Therefore, the rapid advancement of this movement has become the unanimous and enthusiastic demand of the entire nation today. Today, the General Assembly is established in the capital, bringing together party and government agencies, social elites, and economic experts into a supreme institution to plan and promote the practical work of the nation's economic construction. This is the starting point for the widespread implementation of China's national economic construction, and it is also the beginning of our sincere adherence to the Principle of People's Livelihood in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Regarding the significance of this movement and its implementation items, I published a special article on last year's Double Tenth Festival, elaborating on them in detail. Today, at the time of the General Assembly's establishment, I will specifically read the original text again to call the attention of all comrades in this committee and the people of the country. (Reading the full text) The entire essence of the National Economic Construction Movement has been summarized in this declaration. It not only declares that China is a country lacking in materials, but that to make the most of the land, we must first make the most of the people's efforts. The people's occupations, positions, knowledge, and abilities may differ, but everyone can make some contribution to this movement. Therefore, how to plan and allocate resources, how to conduct surveys and designs, how to train talent, and how to arouse unified enthusiasm, so that human and material resources are properly linked to develop our national economy, is what the General Assembly and its branches should first focus on. From now on, I hope that all comrades in this committee and the people of the country will follow this guiding principle, divide the work, cooperate, and do our best to promote progress, striving to complete this basic work of national construction in the shortest possible time and elevate our nation to the realm of wealth, strength, and happiness. I am willing to encourage all comrades to work together. (4th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Construction Movement Committee was established on the 4th and will soon establish various groups to research, design, and proceed, according to the provisions of the General Assembly's charter. The list will be drawn up by Chief Standing Committee Member Wu Dingchang and submitted to the Chairman for approval. As for the candidates for staff positions, they will also be announced after the Chairman's approval. The General Assembly's offices will be located in the Minister's office of the Ministry of Industries, and the remaining offices will be converted from the reception room after it is renovated.

<h3 id="e19">League of Nations Assembly Presidium Passes Draft Resolution - Reaffirms Covenant Principles - Revokes Sanctions Committee Proceedings - Implementation of Covenant to be Discussed in September <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the League of Nations Assembly held a meeting at 9:30 this morning. Chairman Zilan, the Prime Minister of the Belgian cabinet, passed the report and resolution on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and scheduled it for discussion at the Assembly at 6:00 PM today. The content of the draft resolution is as follows: Reaffirm that the Assembly adheres to the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant and the declaration issued by the American countries on August 3, 1932 (namely, the declaration stating that territorial disputes should not be resolved by force).</p>
<p>The request for financial assistance from the Emperor of Abyssinia should be rejected. How to improve the implementation of the Covenant should be proposed by the member states to the League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol before September 1, so that a report can be submitted to the Standing Committee. As for the date of the meeting, the Presidium proposed to be September 21.</p>
<p>The Sanctions Adjustment Committee should submit proposals to the governments concerned to revoke the sanctions against Italy.</p>
<p>After the Presidium meeting, the Assembly continued to meet at 12:10, but only briefly. Chairman Zilan read out the draft resolution passed by the Presidium and said that the representative of a certain country intended to study the draft resolution carefully and would wait until the Assembly continues to meet at 6:00 PM today before submitting it for discussion.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Sanctions Adjustment Committee, originally scheduled to convene at 3:30 this afternoon, has been postponed. However, the Executive Council is scheduled to discuss the issue of the Free City of Danzig at 5:30 this afternoon. It is said that the reason the Assembly was postponed to 6:00 PM to discuss the draft resolution was due to the opposition of the Ethiopian delegation. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the League of Nations has agreed on a draft resolution today, which will be submitted to the Assembly. The wording of the case is very broad, and its preface acknowledges that various situations have hindered the entire implementation of the League Covenant and reaffirms the principles of the Covenant. This has also been stated in diplomatic documents such as the declaration issued by the South American countries on August 3, 1932, opposing the resolution of land issues by force. The preface continues, stating that it intends to adapt the implementation of these principles to the lessons learned from experience, thereby consolidating the authority of the League of Nations, and also mentions that the League's guarantee for the safety of its members should increase its true effectiveness. The resolution asks the League of Nations member states to submit their suggestions to the League of Nations Secretary-General before September 1, 1936, to improve the implementation of the Covenant's principles. These suggestions will be studied by the Secretary-General first, and then reported to the League of Nations Assembly in September.</p>
<p>The sanctions issue is discussed in another resolution, which states that "it hopes that the Sanctions Adjustment Committee will notify the governments concerned of the necessary suggestions to terminate the plans adopted in Article 16 of the Covenant." As for the Ethiopian Emperor's request that the annexation of Ethiopia by Italy not be recognized and that Ethiopia be provided with a loan of 10 million pounds, it is mentioned in another report passed by the Presidium, which states that the "non-recognition" issue is included in the resolution, and as for Ethiopia's request for financial assistance, it has been considered and rejected in previous meetings and should not be discussed.

<p>(Geneva) The draft resolution on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute proposed by the Presidium of the League of Nations Assembly will be submitted for a vote this afternoon. According to the current provisions of the Covenant, it must be approved by a unanimous vote to pass. At that time, the Ethiopian delegation will certainly vote against it. This resolution will therefore become a recommendation without binding force. But in practice, it cannot have an impact.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has put aside the Ethiopian issue today and is paying attention to the disputes caused by the activities of the Danzig Nazi Party. The latest dispute was caused by a German warship visiting Danzig, whose captain refused to pay the customary visit to Lester, the League of Nations commissioner stationed in Danzig, at the last moment. After Lester reported this to the League of Nations, the League of Nations Executive Council discussed this matter this afternoon. The fear that the Danzig Nazi Party will stage a violent coup is gradually increasing. However, many believe that Germany will not take this step at present. Greiser, the President of the Danzig Senate and a member of the Nazi Party, has already departed from Berlin to Geneva today. It is said that Forster, the leader of the Danzig Nazi Party, has been summoned by Hitler to Germany for consultations. If Greiser does not adopt a tough stance and intends to expand the situation, the Executive Council will likely ask Poland to mediate everything. At the same time, a Berlin newspaper published an article titled "Lester Must Go," expressing the Nazi Party's desire to remove Lester and stating that Danzig and Poland are now resolving their own problems, so the commissioner no longer needs to be stationed in Danzig.

<p>Danzig The situation here has become increasingly tense since the clash between Forster, the leader of the Danzig Nazi Party branch, and Lester, the senior commissioner of the League of Nations.

Greiser, the President of the City Council, has flown to Berlin to consult with the German government on the situation in Danzig. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Greiser, the President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, arrived here by plane this afternoon and will go to Weimar, Thuringia, to meet with Führer Hitler to discuss the situation in Danzig. It is said that Greiser intends to adopt a neutral attitude towards the dispute between Lester, the senior commissioner of the League of Nations in the Free City, and Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party branch there, believing that this matter only involves Forster personally and has nothing to do with the Danzig municipal government. According to private sources, Forster also returned to the country a few days ago and is now consulting with various Nazi Party leaders on the party's future actions in the Free City. It is also said that the United Kingdom has proposed that the situation in Danzig is such that the safety of Lester, the senior commissioner of the League of Nations, is of concern, and it is proposed that Poland be responsible for protection. Nazi Party figures have expressed dissatisfaction with this proposal. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>

The British government seems to be preparing to make another effort based on the Ambassador's report, hoping to cooperate with Germany to promote the organization of collective security.

<h3 id="e31">Japanese Fishing Boat Detainment Case: Russia and Japan Hold Conflicting Views; Both Sides File Protests <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister spoke with Japanese Ambassador Ota yesterday, asking Ota to pay attention to the arbitrary actions of Japanese submarines. They had placed eleven Japanese flag-style markers in a straight line within the Soviet territorial waters near the Kamchatka coast in the Karyusov Strait and the area of the Pu Islands. According to the commander of the aforementioned submarine, these marked the three-mile Soviet territorial sea boundary. In addition, the submarine commander also sent a letter to the commanders of various Soviet ships, informing them that the placed markers were not to be moved. Mr. Stomonyakov opposed Japan's claim that these markers were intended to prevent Japanese fishermen from fishing within the three-mile Soviet territorial waters, and stated that ship captains should use nautical instruments to determine the territorial sea boundaries of various countries. Furthermore, it was unprecedented in international relations for Japanese military officers to unilaterally establish territorial sea markers for another country. Mr. Stomonyakov continued by saying that the Soviet government had repeatedly pointed out that such demonstrations and unfriendly actions by the Japanese side could only encourage illegal behavior by Japanese fishermen. He stated that, unfortunately, the Soviet government had observed an increase in Japanese fishing boats intruding into Soviet territorial waters off the southwest and east coasts of Kamchatka and fishing within the three-mile territorial sea. He also recounted to the Japanese ambassador the most recent incidents of this type. Mr. Stomonyakov continued by saying that on June 29, a patrol boat from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, encouraged by a Japanese submarine anchored near Soviet territorial waters, violated the order prohibiting entry into Soviet territorial waters and chased a small boat of the Soviet border guards, forcing it to stop and release Japanese fishing boats detained for fishing in Soviet territorial waters. On July 2, a Japanese submarine took similar actions, approaching a Soviet border guard patrol boat, signaling it to stop and hand over Japanese fishing boats previously detained for fishing in Soviet territorial waters. The Soviet patrol boat ignored these signals, and the Japanese submarine returned an hour later, continuing to demand the same result. Mr. Stomonyakov also asked Ota to pay attention to the Japanese tanker violating Soviet rules by allowing more than thirty crew members to disembark without the permission of the Soviet local authorities while staying in the port of Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky on Sakhalin Island. Mr. Stomonyakov, on behalf of the Soviet government, protested the above actions of Japanese submarines and government vessels, requested measures to prevent such incidents, and punish those responsible, and declared that if such actions continue to occur, the Japanese government will be responsible for any disputes that arise. At the same time, Mr. Stomonyakov stated that the Soviet government hopes to change the current situation. If the Japanese government cannot severely warn Japanese citizens to refrain from violating Soviet laws and illegally fishing in Soviet territorial waters, then the Soviet authorities will inevitably detain many Japanese fishing boats fishing illegally in Soviet territorial waters. Ota promised to convey this message to the Japanese government and provide a response later. (4th TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to a report released today by the Department of Commerce, in the first five months of this year, China's trade with the United States was in a surplus position, with a total of US$36,984,000 worth of goods exported to the United States and US$15,856,000 worth of goods imported from the United States. Exports for May amounted to US$6,526,000 and imports amounted to US$3,481,000. (3rd Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today that in the week ending June 26, the United States imported a total of $6,834,731 in silver, the highest record since February 7. This was largely the result of massive exports from China, with a total of 5.4 million yuan coming from China, all landed in San Francisco. It is understood that this Chinese silver was purchased by the U.S. Treasury Department in mid-May. Other sources included 936,089 yuan from Mexico, 245,976 yuan from Peru, 192,951 yuan from Canada, and 40,453 yuan from Honduras. At the same time, cash inflows amounted to as much as 38,049,998 yuan. Therefore, if the Treasury Department proceeds according to the Silver Purchase Act, the goal of reducing the gold-to-silver ratio to 3:1 is still a long way off. (3rd Guomin dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Income Tax Regulations have been reviewed and completed by the Legislative Yuan, and will be submitted to the meeting for approval on the 7th, and then submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The Inheritance Tax is still under deliberation. According to Gao Bingfang, director of the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office, the collection of income tax is divided into three categories: (salary income), (business profit income), and (interest income). The method of collecting salary income is different from the originally collected civil servant income donation, because the income donation adopts a full-amount progressive system, while the income tax adopts a half-amount progressive system, which is lighter than the income donation. The date of commencement of collection, because the regulations still have to go through legislative procedures, the promulgation period is yet to be determined. Roughly, the two categories of profit and interest will be calculated according to the fiscal year, that is, starting from this year (July). The salary income part will not be collected in July and August. Whether the collection agency will be established separately or the tax agency will handle it concurrently is under consideration.

<p>(Peiping) British Consul Fitzmorris reopened the trial today of Kirk, a guard from the British Embassy, accused of inflicting bodily harm on a Japanese man, Onishi, on the night of May 26 at the No. 27 tavern. Major Kingsley, commander of the guard detachment of the British Embassy, and Major Shakespeare, medical officer of the guard detachment, testified that the defendant did not commit any acts of violence that night. Mr. Kant, a lawyer from Tianjin, spoke in defense of the defendant, stating that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were mostly contradictory, and that there was documentary evidence proving that the defendant did not commit any acts of violence that night. He argued that the defendant could not be convicted based on unreliable testimony. After Kant finished his speech, the British Consul presiding over the trial immediately acquitted the defendant and released him in court. Reuters learned from reliable Japanese sources that the Japanese Residents Association was greatly angered by the British Consul's verdict in this case. The Standing Committee held a meeting tonight to discuss the fact that in both cases, Kirk and Hunt were accused of beating Sasaki to death, and Kirk was accused of injuring Onishi, and both were acquitted by the British Consular Court and released. It was resolved to hold a plenary meeting at 5 pm on Monday next week to decide on the attitude to be taken in these two cases, and a resolution will be passed and submitted to the British and Japanese Embassies. It is expected that the resolution will ask the British Embassy to seek a "sincere solution."

<p>豐台事件解決經過</p>
<p>Beijing correspondence: On the 26th of last month, a horse from the 37th Division of the 29th Army stationed in Fengtai broke loose and strayed into the Japanese barracks in the area. A groom from the 37th Division went to retrieve it, which led to a scuffle, resulting in injuries on both sides, and thus the so-called "Fengtai Incident." The headquarters of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin reported the incident and instructed Imabu Takeo, the military attaché attached to the Japanese embassy in Beijing, to make a request to the Hebei-Chahar authorities. On the 29th, Lin Gengyu, a section chief from the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, together with Qinghui, a counselor from the Japanese embassy, went to Fengtai to investigate, accompanied by representatives from the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters and the Beijing Municipal Government. They returned to Beijing that same day. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Chen Juesheng, acting chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the evening of the 30th, summoning him to Beijing to negotiate with Imabu Takeo, the military attaché attached to the Japanese embassy, and Matsumuro Takayoshi from the Japanese garrison. After two days of negotiations, Chen Juesheng explained to the Japanese side that both parties should proceed on the principle of equality and mutual benefit to avoid further misunderstandings. The Japanese side was understanding. The incident was largely resolved by the evening of the 2nd of this month, and after formalities were completed on the 3rd, it was announced as resolved. However, the people of Fengtai had already been greatly alarmed. After the incident was concluded, Chen Juesheng left Beijing and returned to Tianjin. According to Chen's remarks to visitors late on the 2nd, "There were misunderstandings on both sides at the time of the Fengtai Incident, but after sincere consultations based on mutual understanding, it was resolved satisfactorily on the 3rd. However, the troops of both sides are stationed too close to each other in Fengtai, which can easily lead to misunderstandings over minor matters. It is hoped that both sides will adhere to the principle of mutual understanding in order to turn big problems into small ones, and small problems into nothing. Recently, there has been neither progress nor stagnation in the Hebei-Chahar foreign affairs situation. The other party has repeatedly stated that it will not infringe upon our country's territory and sovereignty, and our side is also negotiating in a spirit of friendship in accordance with the principle of good neighborliness. The number of personnel handling negotiations on both sides is increasing based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. In this environment, it is necessary to act practically, and not just engage in empty rhetoric. Not only should we hope to avoid trouble in the negative aspect, but we should also focus on alleviating the people's suffering in the positive aspect. However, I am not a person who handles foreign affairs, Mr. Chen Zhongfu will be able to return to Beijing on the evening of the 3rd, and there should be new progress in foreign affairs. As for the attitude of the Beijing authorities towards the central government and the southwest, they have already issued a telegram, stating that they are based on the principle of peace and national salvation and absolutely oppose civil war to relieve the national crisis," etc. As for the resolution of the Fengtai Incident, the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee will officially announce it on the 3rd.</p>
<p>蚌埠糧市活躍</p>
<p>Active Grain Market in Bengbu</p>
<p>麥豆運集市價見漲　運費減輕銷路暢旺</p>
<p>Wheat and Soybeans Gathered, Market Prices Rise; Reduced Freight Rates, Smooth Sales</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui is crisscrossed by rivers and has fertile soil, known for its abundant agricultural products. Wheat and soybeans are the major crops. The Ying River basin (Fuyang, Taihe), the Wo River basin (Hao County, Guoyang), the Xiaofei River basin (Shouxian, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Wuhe), are agricultural areas that produce wheat and soybeans. These vast amounts of products, in addition to being sold locally, are mostly concentrated in Bengbu, and then transported to Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai. In addition, wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains from Luyi, Shenqiu, and Zhecheng in eastern Henan, and Xincai, Shangcheng, and Gushi in southern Henan are also mostly transported and sold to other provinces via Bengbu. Therefore, due to the convenience of land and water transportation, Bengbu has become the largest grain market between Anhui and Henan in the past 20 years. The maximum annual outbound volume reaches more than 5 million packages. This summer, northern Anhui had a bumper harvest of wheat and soybeans, and eastern Henan still has a large amount of soybeans in storage. Recently, with the rise in grain prices in the north and south, and the Anhui Provincial Government supervising the construction of agricultural warehouses in various counties to store rice and grain in preparation for the autumn harvest, which facilitates transportation and sales, farmers in various counties are flocking to Bengbu with wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains, and the number of people waiting to sell is endless. The grain stored in the stalls and various warehouses is piled up like mountains. Grain merchants from Jiangsu and Anhui, especially those from Tianjin and Shanghai, are finding outlets and are buying at opportune moments and transporting the goods out of the province by truck. In the past ten days, the Bengbu grain market has suddenly become active, and both wheat and soybeans have shown growth. In addition, the Jinpu Railway has reduced the freight rate for wheat by 30% to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, which has greatly facilitated grain merchants. It is reported that more than 60 brokers have recently gathered in Bengbu to purchase goods, and nine flour mills have also sent people to Bengbu to buy wheat. The mortgage business done by various banks has also increased sharply compared with the past. Due to the smooth sales of soybeans, large-seed soybeans from Xincai have risen to 16.2 yuan per stone, soybeans from Shouzhou have risen to 16.1 yuan, soybeans from Dahewan have risen to 15.85 yuan, buckwheat from Yingzhou is 12 yuan per stone, buckwheat from Feihe is 11.9 yuan, red wheat from Shouzhou is 12 yuan, and buckwheat from Nanhe is 11.6 yuan. The average daily transaction volume of soybeans and wheat is more than 2,000 stones. Market prices are rising without falling. Due to the sudden activity in the grain market, other businesses in Bengbu, with financial adjustments, are also showing signs of vitality and prosperity. (July 1)</p>

The general public who went to watch were caught in the rain, which was not very pleasant.</p>
<p>久旱忽逢甘雨</p>
<p>Long Drought Suddenly Meets Sweet Rain</p>
<p>Huaiyin has not rained for a month, and the leaves of all early autumn crops have withered and turned yellow. Late autumn [lacuna] taro, green beans, and [lacuna] [lacuna] wheat cannot be planted. As a result, the prices of rice and wheat are rising daily, which is unprecedented. This morning (the 1st), the sky suddenly changed, and the air pressure was very low. Around 9:00 AM, there was a shower, which lasted about half an hour. The average water accumulation on the ground was [lacuna] inches. After a long drought, all kinds of grains suddenly received this sweet rain, and the villagers were overjoyed.</p>

<p>Hangzhou: Businessmen Apply for Loans for Tung Oil</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department, in order to improve planting and control transportation and sales of tung oil, which is abundant in Jindong, Yan, and other counties in Zhejiang, convened a meeting of cooperative instructors from various counties to discuss business operations through cooperation and requested the Shanghai Commercial Bank to provide loans for tung oil production, transportation, and sales. The bank has agreed. The Zhejiang Construction Department has sent Tang Yize, director of the cooperation section, to Shanghai to discuss the matter in person. The amount is approximately 100,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Large Batch of Freight Cars Transported to Hangzhou</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was opened to traffic in Nanchang, transportation between the two provinces has become more convenient, and freight volume has increased daily. In addition to building five or six warehouses at the major freight gathering points along the railway to meet needs, the railway has purchased 50 freight cars from the state-owned railways. They were transported to Hangzhou yesterday for transfer to the railway for transporting goods and put into operation by the Yunan section.</p>
<p>南巡佳話</p>
<p>Anecdotes of a Southern Tour</p>
<p>本報特派記者石曲</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Shi Qu of this Newspaper</p>
<p>前奏曲</p>
<p>Overture</p>
<p>The title "Anecdotes of a Southern Tour," if not explained beforehand, might lead some readers to fantasize. The "Southern Tour" referred to here means a trip starting from Shanghai to several southern provinces, the scope of which is undefined, generally in the Jiangnan region. "Jia" means good, and can also be understood as beautiful or virtuous. Its meaning in conjunction with the word "hua" (anecdote) is simply a well-intentioned narration. If one were to associate "Southern Tour" with the imperial terms such as "xunxing," "xunshou," or "xungong" in historical records, and assume that the reporter also harbors a corrupt "uncrowned king" mentality, ready to launch a scathing attack, or even extrapolate from the word "jiahua," which sounds almost romantic, that the subject matter of this article will be limited to the refined and elegant matters like talented scholars and beautiful ladies, butterflies dancing and birds chirping, all of these would be equally misleading. In short, the purpose of this Southern Tour is to try to get close to the grassroots of various societies in order to make a relatively profound observation of the local customs, landscapes, politics, economy, and social institutions. Although it is the height of summer and the scorching sun is raging, it is expected that what the "tour" will encounter, both visually and aurally, will be the periodic tragedies of floods, droughts, and wars, and the exploitation of political and economic power by foreigners. Whether the nation has a chance of revival, perhaps a glimmer of dawn can be seen in this. If we consider such tragedies and laments not to be the positive aspects of "anecdotes" and ignore them with our eyes wide open, then wouldn't we [lacuna] deviate from the true meaning of the mission undertaken by this trip?</p>
<p>松江的景色</p>
<p>The Scenery of Songjiang</p>
<p>Jiangnan scenery has been praised by famous people throughout the ages. This trip originally intended to pay more attention to the dynamic aspects of social conditions; however, as soon as I boarded the train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and it rumbled out of the Shanghai urban area, the lotus ponds and willow embankments on both sides, the distant villages and nearby streams, the ripe wheat like yellow clouds, and the new rice like green brocade, all intertwined into a vivid and dazzling movie, with one scene following another. Moreover, the weather is abnormal this summer, and the warm breeze blowing towards me still feels soft and gentle, as if it were still the season of "a tree covered in flowers, the [lacuna] oriole singing wildly." As a result, the thought of praising nature could not help but arise spontaneously. However, seeing the fishermen with broken nets and leaky boats fishing in the shallow river, and the farmers crawling like cows in the rice paddies, weeding with bare backs, it is not good to imagine the depths of their lives, whether they are in heaven or hell. Otherwise, the momentary beautiful thoughts of transcending reality would quickly turn into a fleeting [lacuna] dream.</p>
<p>Songjiang is the first major station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway heading south. The scenery is beautiful and the transportation is convenient. If you are too tired of living in Shanghai and want to refresh your eyes, but find Suzhou and Hangzhou a bit too far, it is not bad to arrange a trip here. Here is the First Pavilion of Yun Jian, a grand building with thick pillars that are as wide as a person can embrace, a relic of two thousand years ago. Legend has it that the area in front of the pavilion was once the sea. During the Three Kingdoms period, Wu Commander Zhou Yu trained the navy here and held ceremonies to appoint generals. Geologists say that the coastline gradually expands eastward, averaging about one mile every sixty years, which can serve as mutual evidence. On Sheshan Mountain, a scenic area more than ten miles from the city, there is also a large astronomical observatory that stores precious charts and films obtained through measurement and photography. Visitors can learn many interesting facts and knowledge about astronomy. The four-gilled bass produced in the river at Xiuye Bridge in the west of the city has enjoyed a lasting reputation since it was praised by the ancients. Songjiang has always been known for its literary atmosphere. Lu Ji and Lu Yun during the Jin Dynasty, and the Ji Society and Fu Society during the Ming Dynasty, all occupy important pages in the history of cultural movements. Songjiang was originally the seat of the government during the Qing Dynasty, governing counties such as Shanghai. Before long, Shanghai leaped to become one of the world's leading metropolises. Songjiang is nearby, and the shop signs and amusement park facilities are desperately trying to imitate Shanghai, but unfortunately, those narrow streets and old buildings cannot be transformed accordingly.</p>
<p>嘉興紙廠及勝景</p>
<p>Jiaxing Paper Mill and Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Jiaxing, located in the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, is a major station where the railway enters Zhejiang, forming a strategic corner with Shanghai and Suzhou. With the recent completion of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, its geographical position is even more important. With highways and waterways even more accessible in all directions, the urban prosperity of Jiaxing in the future will definitely see significant progress. I came on an early train, originally planning to get off here and visit the Minfeng Paper Mill, one of the leading paper manufacturers in the country. The factory is about a mile from the station, with a large scale, complete organization, and a capital of 1.25 million yuan, all commercially run by shareholders. The factory is divided into new and old sections. The old factory was established in the 19th year of the Republic and specializes in producing paperboard for various hard cardboard boxes. The raw materials are nothing more than straw, burlap sacks, and waste paper. The new paper mill specializes in making cigarette paper, with more sophisticated machinery. It just started operating this year and is still in the sampling period, but the results are already impressive. On one side, there is a pile of unrelated old things such as hemp, fishing nets, and summer cloth being transported in, and on the other side, countless lengths of snow-white cigarette paper are being drawn out, piled in large rolls in front of you, which is truly lovely and delightful. Moreover, it is a national industry, and I am particularly happy to visit it, even more than visiting any large foreign factory.</p>
<p>In the paper-making process, female workers first sort the raw materials according to their thickness and color, placing them in separate locations. Male workers then use a cutting machine to [lacuna] crush them and transfer them to the machinery room powered by steam or electricity, placing them in several large steaming balls, each capable of holding five tons of grass. Using 50 pounds of steam power (i.e., extremely high temperature), they are steamed and boiled until soft, then poured into the pulp room for washing and bleaching, gradually forming a fine and clean paper pulp, which automatically flows into the paper-making machine. Using a wide and appropriately long felt [lacuna] and an extremely fine copper wire mesh wheel, they filter and draw it out, removing water and leaving fibers, which becomes the paper base. If a paper has a distinct front and back or has a layer of coarse material in the middle, two or three layers of paper base are used and attached to each other in sequence. The long strips are sent to the drying room, where they are pressed and baked by a machine to remove moisture, dry, smooth, and polish the paper, and then rolled and packaged, completing the process. From the raw materials entering the steaming ball to the finished paper, machine power is mainly used, and manual labor seems relatively idle. Cigarette paper takes about [lacuna] ten hours to make, while paperboard can be produced in half a day. The magic of machinery is truly great.</p>
<p>The entire factory employs approximately 700 people. The working day is ten hours, with the highest-paid staff earning 200 yuan per month and workers 80 yuan. The lowest-paid staff earn 20 yuan per month and workers 13 yuan. Female workers are paid daily, only 25 cents or 28 cents, amounting to only seven or eight yuan per month. However, they are solely responsible for selecting raw materials, with dust filling the entire room, and the air is very polluted, making it a dangerous job prone to lung disease. In recent years, cultural undertakings in various places, such as newspaper offices, bookstores, and other academic institutions, have sprung up everywhere, but most of the huge amount of paper used is imported. The existing Minfeng Factory can produce cigarette paper and paperboard, and the Shanghai Longhua Paper Mill can produce Daolin paper, making them two strong forces in reclaiming this lost profit margin. In addition, there is the Wenxi Paper Mill, which is jointly run by the government and businesses and was originally intended to produce newspaper paper, but it has been in preparation for a long time and has not yet made its appearance, probably because it has a bit of officialdom and has put on a full official air.</p>
<p>After leaving the Minfeng Paper Mill, it was still early, so I went to see several historical sites. One is the East Pagoda Temple, with a pagoda twelve zhang high, and behind it is the [lacuna] tomb of Zhu Maichen. Another is the Six Sail Pavilion, with a small and exquisite structure of pavilions, terraces, and rockeries. The best scenery is the Rain and Mist Tower on South Lake. South Lake is also called Yuan Lake, and it is symmetrical to another Yang Lake. The layout of the Rain and Mist Tower is very similar to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon on West Lake and the Tie Gong Temple on Daming Lake. Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty visited the place three times. Luo Aiai, a poet prostitute of the late Yuan Dynasty, held gatherings of scholars at this tower. Gao Shou and Sun Yat-sen also visited the tower, which seems to be the glory of the Rain and Mist Tower, so there are [lacuna] steles and plaques to refer to. However, what actually attracts tourists is probably the ordinary painted boats and jade beauties (commonly called boat [lacuna]), who dress up in colorful ways and even [lacuna] tour to the train station to solicit business. When rowing the boat, there is another helper (an old woman) to do the rowing, while they are just the fragrant bait to accompany tourists in conversation and laughter. If you are "in the know" about this, and you happen to hear their delicate cries of "ferry" while passing by, and you have no need to take a boat, then [lacuna] you will truly feel it is more difficult than Wu Zixu crossing Zhaoguan Pass.</p>
<p>Later, I took the southbound train at 5:00 PM and arrived in Hangzhou at 7:00 PM. Along the way, mulberry [lacuna] and rice fields stretched out like a carpet. It was not until Hangzhou that I saw mountains. Li Han of the Tang Dynasty once said, "If Jiahe has a good harvest, the Jianghuai region will be prosperous; if Jiahe has a poor harvest, the Jianghuai region will be frugal." This shows that the Jiahu area has long been known for its fertile soil. However, with the rapid increase in population, I am afraid there is no surplus grain for export.

<p>Local News: Heavy Rainstorm Yesterday; Temperature Drops to Around 60 Degrees; Strong Winds and Waves on the Yangtze River; High Tide on the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The weather in this city was unbearably hot a few days ago. On the 2nd, it suddenly turned cooler, and the temperature dropped from over 90 degrees to 80 degrees. On the 3rd, it dropped again to over 70 degrees. Yesterday was even colder, almost like late autumn, and there was wind and rain. This was due to the low-pressure system.</p>
<p>Hurricane Moving North; Unlikely to Hit Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the observatory, a hurricane has formed in the northern part of the Lesser Ryukyus, located between 120 degrees east longitude and 20 degrees north latitude, moving northwest. However, its progress is not very fast. Shanghai is unlikely to be affected. General observations suggest that this hurricane may enter the South China and Central China regions. However, it is impossible to say for sure if the wind direction changes by then.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain All Day Long</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather in this city suddenly turned cooler. At 7 a.m., a heavy rainstorm hit, accompanied by strong winds. Subsequently, the wind and rain came intermittently, sometimes heavy and sometimes light, lasting all day. The windows and doors of houses rattled loudly, and the weather was gloomy, like late autumn. Residents wearing only light clothing shivered uncontrollably. The temperature was extremely cold, but there was little change from morning to night. Around 8 a.m., it was 67.1 degrees, and the highest later was 68 degrees, a difference of nearly 30 degrees compared to the 95 degrees on the 1st of this month. This kind of weather is most likely to make people sick.</p>
<p>Sudden Heat and Cold; Merchants Suffer</p>
<p>The recent fluctuations in temperature are due to the recent low-pressure system. Moreover, it is the plum rain season, with unpredictable sunny and rainy weather. During this period, merchants suffer the most. After the sudden heat a few days ago, small merchants rushed to open cold drink shops to meet the demand for refreshment. Large restaurants, bars, dance halls, etc., installed air conditioning. However, just as the cold drink shops opened and the air conditioning was installed, the weather turned cold again, and customers were few, resulting in losses.</p>
<p>Waves on the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers</p>
<p>The recent waves on the Yangtze River are also due to the low-pressure system. Shipping companies are on alert. The Huangpu River in Shanghai began to experience consecutive high tides yesterday, which are expected to last until the 10th. Yesterday's high tide was 10 feet 6 inches, quite close to the riverbank. The ships and sails floating on the water created a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>Trial of Vagrant Assault on Police Officer at Xiqin Place Concluded</p>
<p>Facts Clarified; Judgment on the 9th</p>
<p>Guanhejing Xiqin Place housed vagrants Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, Hong Jianfu, etc., and fugitives Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, Wu Ruilin, who dug tunnels to escape and resisted arrest, beating patrolman Lu Yecai to death. Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, Hong Jianfu, Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, and Wu Ruilin were prosecuted for murder. After several hearings without a conclusion, further investigation was ordered. Now, after a detailed investigation by Judge Zhao Yongzhou, the facts have been clarified. Yesterday, Judge Zhao interrogated Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, etc. They all confessed that they followed the fugitives Yao Benren and Wu Ruilin in plotting to escape. Lu shouted and was beaten, unexpectedly suffering serious injuries and dying the next day. Hong Jianfu claimed that he neither conspired to escape nor participated in the obstruction, and that he did not dare to oppose what they did. At this point, the court appointed a defense lawyer for the debate. After the debate was concluded, the court announced that the judgment would be made on the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>Bao Gang's Lawsuit Against Cui Changgui and Others for Conspiracy; Preliminary Hearing Scheduled</p>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang was accused by Cui Changgui at the Public Security Bureau of seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua. The detective team arrested Bao's wife Cao Xiang'e, the rickshaw puller's friend Ma Heshang, and servants. Bao surrendered himself to the District Court, accusing Cui and Yang of conspiracy and the detective team leader of dereliction of duty. The case was transferred to the District Court. After a preliminary hearing by Prosecutor Kong, Bao's wife and servants were released on bail, and Yang Yuehua was taken back by Cui. The District Court has scheduled a preliminary hearing for this case on the 7th of this month. In addition to summoning Bao and other parties involved, detectives Zhang Datong, Xue Shilin, Wang Peiting, Deng Shaochen, and others have been summoned to court for questioning.</p>
<p>Adulterous Lover Attacks and Injures Wu Bixiang in the Head and Face</p>
<p>Fellow Villager Boarding at His Home Leads to Love Affair; Husband's Supervision Immediately Reported</p>
<p>Wu Bixiang, a 52-year-old man from Yangzhou, lived at 9 Taiyang Temple Road, Zhabei. He had a 28-year-old son named Guangtai, who ran a cobbler's stall at Hongruili, Wenzhou Road, Hongkou. Guangtai's wife, Zhang, was 24 years old and somewhat attractive. In March, a fellow villager named Meng Chunfang boarded at Wu's home. Over time, he had an affair with Zhang, which was not a one-time occurrence. Later, Wu Bixiang discovered the affair and kicked Meng out, forbidding Zhang from contacting Meng. However, after several months, Meng could not forget Zhang. The afternoon before, he returned to her home. After Bixiang returned home, the child reported that Chunfang had been there. Wu was very angry. After dinner, he went alone to his son Guangtai's place and explained everything. Guangtai was furious and told his father Bixiang to stay there temporarily to watch the door. He rushed home to argue with his wife, showering her with blows. He knew that Chunfang was well-informed. That night, Meng understood the whole situation. At 3:30 a.m., he went to Wu's place and stabbed Wu Bixiang in the head and face with a kitchen knife. The assailant fled without a trace. The injured man was taken to Zha Long Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations Reopen General Assembly; Biscuit and Other Industries Deny Being Listed</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food Trade Association, and the Iron Printing and Can Manufacturing Trade Association were listed in the newspaper report stating that more than 20 trade associations requested the Chamber of Commerce to continue holding a membership general assembly. They stated that they were not aware of this beforehand and did not sign or stamp their names. It is clear that someone forged documents with ulterior motives. They have sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to declare their denial. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>We were deeply puzzled when we saw the article in the Times newspaper on the 2nd, stating that more than 30 trade associations petitioned the Chamber of Commerce to continue holding a general assembly. We later learned that our association was among the more than 30 associations listed. Before this general assembly, our association, along with the Flower and Tree Industry Association and others, jointly sent a letter to your Chamber requesting accommodation due to unpaid fees, so that we could be issued attendance certificates as usual. This is a fact. We have not heard of other matters regarding personal attacks and reports. We are deeply concerned about any misunderstandings. We hereby send this letter to clarify the situation and correct any rumors. We request your kind attention."</p>

<p>Yu Baolian Catches His Fiancée in Adultery</p>
<p>Finds Where Lovers Secretly Meet; Drags Out the Illicit Pair</p>
<p>Li Meiying, a young woman from Taizhou, is 19 years old with an alluring figure and beautiful appearance. She lived with her father and brothers in Zhoujiadu, Pudong. She was betrothed to her neighbor Yu Baolian (22 years old) since childhood. However, Meiying's love blossomed early. In July, she came to Shanghai for fun and was seduced by Yin Guichun (22 years old) from Danyang at an amusement park. On July 11, she eloped to Shanghai and hid at 14 Zhiguang Lane, Jisi Feier Road, western Shanghai. After Meiying eloped, her fiancé Yu Baolian went around listening for news. The day before yesterday, he finally found out where Meiying was hiding. He invited Meiying's brother Li Shouzhi and went to western Shanghai together. At around 11 p.m. yesterday, they reported to the Caojiadu Public Security Branch. After receiving the report, the branch sent police to the scene. When Yin and Li were dragged out of bed, they were both naked, without a stitch of clothing. When they were taken to the police station, someone sent their clothes. The branch chief ordered them to put on their clothes before questioning them. Because the case involved the seduction of a young girl and the apprehension by the fiancé, the branch will prepare a document and send them to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Banking Society Establishes Banking Correspondence School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Society, organized by members of the banking community, was officially established in February 1932. The society's work focuses on academic research. Since its establishment, it has held discussions on banking practices, expanded the library, held academic lectures, compiled Righteous Books, and organized industrial and commercial tours. All activities that benefit bank employees have been undertaken. To increase the knowledge of in-service bank employees and cultivate practical talents in the banking industry, the society has established a banking correspondence school. All regulations have been approved by the society's board of directors, and correspondence courses will begin soon. All faculty members of the school are well-known economists and financial experts in China. Those who wish to know the detailed information of the school can send a letter to the Banking Society at 59 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai, to request the school's detailed regulations.</p>
<p>New Contributions from Guanglu Grand Theater</p>
<p>The Guanglu Grand Theater on Museum Road, the highest-class second-rate theater in Shanghai, specializes in showing blockbusters from Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. The selection of films is extremely serious, and the screening period is reduced to a minimum. Blockbusters are unavoidable, so now, from July 1st, it has cooperated with MGM, and the theater is showing films from three major companies, which is a new innovation in Shanghai. Starting today, the theater is showing the first MGM film, "A Star is Born," starring Janet Gaynor, Fredric March, and Adolphe Menjou. The content is glamorous and romantic, and it is extremely charming. At the same time, new oscillating fans have been installed, providing coolness everywhere upstairs and downstairs, which is better than ice-cooled air conditioning, which is harmful to the human body. Ticket prices are extremely low, with front row seats downstairs costing 3 jiao and back row seats costing 5 jiao, so guests feel at home.</p>
<p>"Ji Qian Ji" Published</p>
<p>Published by His Descendant, Weng Ziguang</p>

<p>Local Supplement of Shen Bao, Amateur Weekly, Art Review of the “Pan Jinlian” Performance in Bumping Opera</p>
<p>A Theatergoer</p>
<p>I had never seen Bumping Opera before, because I believed the propaganda that this kind of drama was of low-level "pornographic" interest, especially favored by idle gentlemen and ladies. But at the same time, I also heard that Bumping Opera was quite popular in Shanghai, and dramas such as "Pan Jinlian" were performed for a long time, with a large audience, showing a "reluctance to stop" trend. This made me a little suspicious. Why would so many people watch Bumping Opera? Isn't it entirely because the drama is too "pornographic"? To resolve this question, I decided to "jump in" and went to see a few Bumping Operas recently.</p>
<p>In my impression, the themes adopted by Bumping Opera are somewhat different from those of Peking Opera: the former mostly uses folk tales and family life; while the latter mostly features unique deeds of royal nobles, immortals, and chivalrous heroes. Secondly, in terms of performance form, I think the makeup, expressions, and dialogues of Bumping Opera are more folk-like, popularized, and easy to understand compared to other old dramas. Take the lyrics, for example. Bumping Opera's lyrics are easier to understand than Peking Opera's, and its tunes are not as complicated as Peking Opera's. Because of these, Bumping Opera is welcomed by the general Shanghai citizens, not only favored by idle gentlemen and ladies. In fact, the main audience of this drama is still ordinary small and medium-sized merchants, clerks, and ordinary families, with the so-called idle gentlemen and ladies being the smallest minority. Of course, "pornography" is also related to the general popularity of this drama among Shanghai people, but I think the main reasons for its widespread audience are the ones mentioned above; in addition, its lower ticket price can also be said to be one of the reasons for its box office success.</p>
<p>Now, we want to specifically talk about Pan Jinlian, which is probably the best and most popular in Bumping Opera.</p>
<p>"Pan Jinlian" is a drama adapted from a section of the famous Chinese novel "Water Margin." Because "Water Margin" is most popular among the people, and almost everyone knows about "Wu Song killing his sister-in-law," the Bumping Opera "Pan Jinlian" derived from it can first attract people's attention. However, I think the main reason why it is applauded by the audience is that it has more progressive ideological content.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the novel "Water Margin" takes the standpoint of ordinary peasants, opposing corrupt officials and local bullies. In the end, it can be said to express the feudal landlord ideology of a group of people who were dissatisfied with the reality at that time and wanted to replace the ruling figures without changing the social foundation of that reality. In the section of Pan Jinlian seducing her brother-in-law and Wu Song killing his sister-in-law, on the one hand, it naturally exposes the crimes of the bully Ximen Qing, but at the same time, on the other hand, under the feudal concept of "marry a chicken, follow a chicken, marry a dog, follow a dog," it simply portrays Pan Jinlian as a vulgar slut. As for the plot of Pan Jinlian being oppressed and framed by the gentry Zhang, "Water Margin" only briefly mentioned it and did not elaborate on it, so that people feel that all the sins are on Pan Jinlian alone. However, the "Pan Jinlian" performed on the stage of Bumping Opera is not like this. First of all, it vividly presents the licentious and decadent life and the tyrannical and evil behavior of the gentry Zhang. It specifically tells the audience: Zhang has two wives and many maids. He smokes opium every day and lives a depraved life. In his boring and depraved life, he even wants to force the maid Pan Jinlian to be his concubine to vent his lust. Because Pan Jinlian is unwilling to be a concubine and refuses to comply, he even finds a way to marry her to the ignorant and ugly Wu Da, trying to make her dissatisfied with this marriage and then return to his arms. In this way, Zhang becomes a typical gentry who bullies others by relying on his power and is licentious and tyrannical. Secondly, regarding Pan Jinlian's adultery and murdering her husband Wu Da, the performance of this drama makes people realize that the fault is not in Pan Jinlian herself, but in the evil deeds of the gentry Zhang and the bully Ximen Qing, and is caused by the feudal society, the feudal forces, and feudal ideas. When Wu Song finally takes the knife to kill Pan Jinlian, she bravely admits in public that Wu Da was poisoned, but she also points out that it was not she who poisoned Wu Da, but Zhang. This wins the applause of the general audience.</p>
<p>The Wu Song appearing on the stage is the same as the Wu Song in the novel, a handsome and typical feudal hero. In order to avenge his brother, he kills the bully Ximen Qing at all costs, which of course makes people applaud, but at the same time, he does not understand that the evil deeds of the local bullies are permitted by the society they control, and he does not understand that Pan Jinlian's behavior of murdering her husband is promoted by the society controlled by the local bullies. Therefore, he does not have any sympathy for Pan Jinlian's encounter. Under the simple concept of avenging his brother, he stabs Pan Jinlian's heart with a ruthless steel knife. The fact is... When Pan Jinlian finally expresses her love for Wu Song, this hero says, "You love me, but I want to love my brother," and then kills Pan Jinlian with one knife. On the one hand, this naturally makes people feel that Wu Song is indeed a hero, but at the same time, it cannot but make people pity Pan Jinlian's encounter.</p>
<p>The Pan Jinlian in the play is not like the Pan Jinlian in the novel: a slut who only knows how to commit adultery; on the contrary, she can be said to be a typical woman who opposes feudal forces and opposes feudal ideas. She is a maid raised by Zhang, and Zhang is a wealthy and powerful gentleman who loves her extremely. As long as she is willing to be a concubine, she can have whatever she wants. For some snobbish women who only want to satisfy their personal material life, it goes without saying that they would be happy to comply, but Pan Jinlian, who works as a maid, resists to the death and bravely declares that she will never be a concubine and will never marry an old man of inappropriate age, clearly expressing her newer idea of "monogamy," saying that she wants to marry a man who is suitable in all aspects and has no wife. Later, under Zhang's vicious framing, when Pan Jinlian marries the ignorant and ugly Wu Da, she is naturally very painful in her heart, really like sitting in "hell"; but at this time, a handsome and brave hero Wu Song appears in front of her, making her feel like she has "seen the sun in hell." Therefore, it is reasonable for her to express her love for Wu Song, and it cannot be said that she is slutty. The drama's expression of this point does not stand on the feudal standpoint and describe Pan Jinlian as a vulgar slut. As for Pan Jinlian's adultery with Ximen Qing, the play even shows her abnormal psychology of love; it shows that after she sincerely loved Wu Song and was rejected, because Ximen Qing has some similarities with Wu Song, she commits adultery with him after seeing him. When Zhang sends someone to take back Pan Jinlian after Wu Da's death, she clearly points out Ximen Qing's weaknesses, saying that she does not really love him, but is just using him as a means to escape. When she is finally about to be killed, she still bravely exposes the sinful deeds of Zhang. It can be imagined that Pan Jinlian in this kind of situation cannot but be regarded with special eyes and attention, and at the same time, the general audience must also be greatly surprised. As for her last heroic confession, it will win the sympathy of the audience. A Pan Jinlian in this form, a woman who resists feudal forces like this, a woman with a newer view of love and passion like this, is probably not seen in other old dramas.</p>
<p>The artistic expression of the drama is also not bad. For example, Zhang's tyranny, Wu Da's honesty, Wu Song's bravery, He Jiu's caution and timidity, and Ximen Qing's bullying are all vividly portrayed; the arrogant form of Zhang instructing He Jiu after Wu Da's death, the tense situation of Wu Song meeting He Jiu after his return, and finally the climax of the whole play of Wu Song killing his sister-in-law, are all vividly presented, attracting the attention and minds of the entire audience to the stage. As for the dialogue in the play, there are also many wonderful parts, but I don't remember them clearly. For example, in the last scene, there is a dialogue with the general meaning like this:</p>
<p>Pan Jinlian said to Wu Song: "Do you want my head or my heart?"</p>
<p>Wu Song said: "I wanted to dig out your heart..."</p>
<p>Pan Jinlian walked towards Wu Song, unbuttoned her collar, and revealed her chest, saying: "Very good, here is a very hot and red heart, just about to offer it to you; no, it has already been offered to you!..."</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Dialogue like this can simply be said to be the same as new drama lyrics.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that the "Pan Jinlian" performed in Bumping Opera is a perfect drama. I am just evaluating it from the point of view of comparing it with general old dramas. Bumping Opera is ultimately Bumping Opera. Its content and form are backward in the modern sense. Even the more progressive "Pan Jinlian," its form is naturally still the old Bumping Opera form, and at the same time, its ideological content, strictly speaking, is also not thorough. However, in the current situation, I think it is better for everyone to watch the Bumping Opera "Pan Jinlian" than to watch Peking Operas like "The Legend of the White Snake" and "The Case of Ji Gong," because the former is, after all, more progressive.</p>

<p>How Many Years Can a Person with Common Sense Live?</p>
<p>Hong Yong</p>
<p>Regarding the lifespan of human beings, there have always been many myths in China; such as Pan Gu and the Three Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, and Man all enjoying tens of thousands of years of life, Peng Zu living eight hundred and eight autumns, and Lao Tzu being pregnant in his mother's body for eighty-three years. Many people who cultivated to become immortals are permanently immortal, which are the specific manifestations of myths about human lifespan. But as the saying goes, "Although there are thousand-year-old trees in the mountains, it is difficult to find a hundred-year-old person in the world." A person's lifespan is ultimately limited. No matter how many myths are used as evidence, in fact, there has never been anyone who has lived for hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years, or even lived forever. Moreover, we must also say that the lifespan of human beings is greatly related to the evolution of the times. The more the times evolve and enter new stages, the more the average lifespan of human beings has the possibility of increasing. According to the general popular view, it is believed that the lifespans of ancient people were long, and the lifespans of modern people are short. This is because they are confused by those myths and only pay attention to certain historical figures with longer lifespans and do not see the whole, which is a misconception and a statement that violates the viewpoint of evolution. According to the investigation of an American scholar named Rigardson, based on the records of three thousand ancient Greek tombstones, the average lifespan of human beings at that time was only twenty years. In the sixteenth century, the average lifespan of human beings was only twenty-one years, in the seventeenth century it was twenty-six years, and in the eighteenth century it increased to thirty-four years. After that, the average lifespan of human beings continued to increase. These facts prove like iron that the lifespan of human beings increases with the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Human life is attached to a healthy body and is not something drifting in the vast sky. It is necessary for a person's body to have a relatively long period of health in order for a relatively long life to continue to exist. However, maintaining the health of the human body cannot be done by calling on people to eat vegetarian food, worship Buddha, respect gods, and believe in ghosts. It is necessary for society to have more complete sanitation facilities and more developed medicine because this is the only way to have more possibilities to prevent and relieve people's diseases and disasters. The average lifespan of modern people is longer than that of people in the past, and the reason lies in this. If the problem is moved to the Soviet Union, it will be even more obvious. In the past, the average lifespan of Russian people was only thirty-two to thirty-three years, but since the October Revolution, because of the fundamental changes in the social system, the continuous progress of social sanitation facilities, the gradual improvement of the general people's lives, and the special development of science, in 1926-27, the average lifespan of Soviet people had increased to forty-four to forty-five years. This means that in the same country, due to the rapid progress of society, the average lifespan of human beings showed an increase of twelve years.</p>
<p>Scientifically researching, the average lifespan of general mammals is about five times their growth period. According to this calculation, the growth time of human beings is twenty-one years, so there is the possibility of living to one hundred and five years. According to the argument of the Soviet Union's Mechnikov, human beings can live to one hundred and twenty years! And Professor Borov, the world biologist who recently passed away, was also confident that he could live to one hundred years. In fact, with the progress of the times and the development of science, human beings do have the possibility of longer-term activities.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, the lifespan of human beings is limited after all, and "old age" and "death" are the inevitable fates of human beings. At the same time, because "old age" is a manifestation of old age, the greater the average lifespan of a country's people, the more elderly people there will inevitably be among them. As in the above-mentioned Soviet Union, because of the increase in the average lifespan of the people, the elderly over sixty years old will account for six to seven percent of the total population. Thus, a question arises here, that is, whether the national strength of a country with many elderly people will be weaker.</p>
<p>Generally, people often confuse "old age" with "senility," "aging," and "old and weak," but in fact, these are completely different phenomena. Because "old age" is a stage in the process of human survival, it stands side by side with youth and prime of life. The so-called "old" is not necessarily "weak." "Healthy old age" and "healthy youth" and "healthy prime of life" can almost be said to have the same significance for a person's achievements. In fact, the great careers of many great figures are often continued in old age, or even completed in old age. For example, Goethe completed "Faust" at the age of eighty; Galileo, when he was already blind at the age of seventy-four, was still working hard to study mechanics and provided many valuable opinions for science; Gorky, who recently passed away, also continued to have great achievements in his old age; in addition, Hugo at the age of eighty-three, Voltaire at the age of eighty-four, Newton at the age of eighty-five, Tolstoy at the age of eighty-eight, and Engels at the age of seventy-five were all continuing their respective lifetime activities and made great contributions to human society.</p>
<p>Whether a person is good or bad for society does not depend on whether he is young or old but is determined by his contribution to society. A modern youth who is young and vigorous, if he only indulges in prostitution, gambling, eating, smoking opium, and injecting morphine, and only strives for unlimited consumption, then he is a useless and harmful waste to society; conversely, an elderly person, if he is still working for society and continues to contribute everything he has to society, then his benefit to society is the same as those young people who work hard for human society. Therefore, we cannot say that the national strength of a country must be weak just because the average lifespan of its people has increased and there are more elderly people with higher lifespans. On the contrary, the increase in the average lifespan of its people and the increase in the number of "healthy elderly people" shows its social progress. And the situation in the Soviet Union is like this, but can you say that the national strength of the Soviet Union is weak and society is backward? The average lifespan of Chinese people is the shortest because of the natural disasters and man-made disasters in recent years and the increase in the mortality rate, especially the child mortality rate. There are also fewer elderly people in Chinese society, but can you say that China's national strength is very strong and society is very progressive?</p>
<p>An Anecdote Concerning the Current State of Germany</p>
<p>Zhen Yi</p>
<p>There were three animals: a cow, a dog, and a donkey who decided to leave Switzerland to try their luck in Germany.</p>
<p>Only a day had passed, and the cow was already back home. She said, "I couldn't take it any longer. They don't have cheese, and they keep milking me all day long."</p>
<p>Only twenty-four hours had passed, and the dog was back as well. He said, "Germany is not suitable for me. Over there, it's not even possible to bark once. Only Hitler has the right to make grand pronouncements."</p>
<p>Only the donkey remained there, and he became the Minister of Propaganda.</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>If he spends all day prostituting, gambling, eating, smoking opium, and shooting morphine, only striving for unlimited consumption, then he is a waste, useless and harmful to society. Conversely, an elderly person, if he is still working for society, continuing to contribute all that he has to society, then the benefits to society are the same as those young people striving for human society. Therefore, we cannot say that a country's national strength must be weak just because the average life expectancy of the people has increased and there are many elderly people with relatively high life expectancy. On the contrary, the increase in the average life expectancy of its people, the increasing number of “healthy elderly people,” is a sign of its social progress. And the situation in the Soviet Union is like this, but can you say that the national strength of the Soviet Union is weak, and the society is regressing? The average life expectancy of the Chinese people, due to natural disasters and man-made disasters in recent years, the mortality rate, especially the increase in child mortality, can be said to be the shortest. There are also fewer elderly people in Chinese society, but can you say that China’s national strength is very strong and the society is very advanced?</p>
<h3 id="e54">Famous People's Interview: Yu Dafu Talks About Ghosts After Becoming an Official <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Bian Mo</p>
<p>Speaking of "Yu Dafu," everyone knows that he was one of the three outstanding members of the Creation Society, who were famous in the literary and artistic circles throughout the country in previous years. He once used a vivid and brilliant writing brush to captivate countless young people who loved literature and art. But the angry tide of the times has swept away many heroes! Our Mr. Yu, who has always been erratic and wandering north and south, has recently been said to have become an official (?). This news is of great concern to most people. By a very coincidental opportunity, not long ago, Mr. Yu came to Shanghai to take up the position of editor of the humorous publication "The Analects," and happened to be at the same banquet as the reporter. Seeing him still wearing a half-old long gown, Chinese-style round-toed shoes, swaying back and forth, and speaking with a strong Hangzhou accent, it was indeed Mr. Yu.</p>
<p>During the banquet, I heard Mr. Yu's conversation with one or two old friends, which reminded me of an old friend Jin Yue's poem: "It is good to use the Zhu Tang as a wine cup, why sigh at the decline of life? Look at the years like flowing water, flowing away the common people never to return!" The tempering of life seems to have bound Mr. Yu Yuansheng, who was once full of literary thoughts and boiling emotions, abnormally submissively!</p>
<p>"How is Mr. Yu's interest in being an official?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What official?" Mr. Yu smiled and said in a self-deprecating way: "This is nothing more than a literary career, a matter of friendship and business. It is also good to do things that can maintain food and clothing without running around for people who have been wandering for many years."</p>
<p>"Can Mr. Yu tell me what your official position is?"</p>
<p>"At first, I was a idle counselor in the provincial government; later, I was in charge of the public gazette office."</p>
<p>"What kind of things do you manage?"</p>
<p>"The provincial government's public gazette and sorting out news from all localities in the province."</p>
<p>"Then this can give you, a realist writer, a lot of material?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it can?" Mr. Yu looked at me: "I am very grateful to hear you use the four words 'realist writer' to describe me! I dare not be a 'writer'! Moreover, I am often added the three words 'decadent school' in this regard. But 'realism' is indeed my consistent style. My environment, my experience, my love, my way of dealing with the world, can all be told to everyone very frankly from my own records! For example, currently working in politics is just my realistic life!"</p>
<p>"Since Mr. Yu pays so much attention to realism, why is 'The Analects,' which you are now editing, going to publish a special issue of 'Ghost Stories'?"</p>
<p>"This is because 'The Analects' has a very wide circulation, and the responsibility of the editor is very great. The materials used must be considered for the public. Thinking about it, I feel that 'ghosts' are things that everyone often talks about and everyone pays attention to, but they are easy to talk about but not easy to refine, and no one has ever been willing to concentrate on expressing their views. Instead, they often end up with ghost stories all over the place, ghost shadows flickering, and elusive. So it is better to be frank and let everyone openly analyze and clarify, and thoroughly describe what they have seen and heard, which is a good thing."</p>
<p>"What are Mr. Yu's high opinions on 'Ghost Stories'?"</p>
<p>"Although science is flourishing, there are still many events that people have not discovered and understood. 'Ghosts' are of course also something worth investigating to the bottom. There are many scientists in the world who are working hard to study them, and we can only listen quietly for good news! As for my personal opinion, I feel that there is quite a blurred line between people and ghosts in this world. If necessary, we can only divide the world into two categories: 'living ghosts' and 'dead ghosts.' In my ideal, I think the category of living ghosts can be said to belong to ghosts who are free to act; the category of dead ghosts are ghosts who can only think but cannot act freely. But currently, everyone is not afraid of living ghosts who are free to act and also have thoughts; while everyone is afraid of dead ghosts who can only think and have no action, and everyone is wary of them, which is a bit beyond my expectation."</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, are you using a humorous tone to satirize this society where people and ghosts are indistinguishable?" I said presumptuously.</p>
<p>"If it contains satire, then I want to compare the current living ghosts to zombies! Because in the ghosts that everyone has spread or intuited, many still have a bit of charm or gentleness; as for zombies, they are simply ferocious like tigers and wolves, and violent like mad dogs!"</p>
<p>"So, many people are really more terrible than ghosts now?"</p>
<p>"No, I am saying that in a world where people and ghosts are indistinguishable, a kind of zombie is the most terrible!"</p>
<p>"Can we defend against it?" I also asked as if I had realized something.</p>
<p>"Although we may not have encountered zombies now, zombies are everywhere, and it is not certain when we will encounter them! There is really no way to defend against them!"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that make people often feel horrified?"</p>
<p>"Who isn't like that? So everyone feels that life is difficult at this time!"</p>
<p>Then Mr. Yu laughed heartily.</p>
<p>At this time, I remembered something else and asked Mr. Yu:</p>
<p>"Officials now have to wear uniforms. Did Mr. Yu wear them when you were working in Fujian?"</p>
<p>"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. How can I be an exception? Moreover, the short-sleeved clothes have already been made. I will naturally wear them when I go back in a few days. Looking back on the past twenty years, most of the days have been spent with a long robe. Once I put on short clothes, I may feel uncomfortable all over."</p>
<p>"I have a few more presumptuous words to say to Mr. Yu!" I said; "I heard that Mr. Yu is one of the writers in our country with considerable royalties, and he has also built a Western-style house in Hangzhou. Why do you make yourself suffer so many restrictions for the sake of life?"</p>
<p>"The vicissitudes of life really make people feel emotional! Royalties have very little protection in the publishing industry in our country, and I myself am one of the members who have suffered losses. For example, I used to publish more books in 'Modern' and 'Guanghua,' but where are these two places now?"</p>
<p>Afterwards, the poet Shao Xunmei also told me that Mrs. Yingxia is still living in Hangzhou, and Mr. Dafu is alone in Fujian. The editorial affairs of "The Analects" are often discussed by Shao and Yu through correspondence, just like when Mr. Yu was in Shanghai. Moreover, Xunmei also said to me: "Dafu's own realism has been misunderstood by others as decadence and learned by them. The people who learned it have indeed become decadent, what do you think?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Everyone still felt interested in the banquet that day because the topics discussed were very interesting: one was "being an official," and the other was talking about "ghosts." However, no one confused "officials" with "ghosts"!</p>
<h3 id="e55">Philosophical Lecture: Internal Causes and External Causes <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Le Bing</p>
<p>The things in the universe, not only from the outside, all stand there individually, and these individual things are all in motion, all taking individual ways of moving. However, if we don't talk about motion, then it's all over. If we want to talk about motion, those motions have causes. Because not only does the motion itself form a series of successive phenomena with the pre-existing phenomena as conditions, but also all motion has a preceding reason for its occurrence, that is, it has a cause. This is the same whether it is mechanical or dynamic motion or developmental qualitative motion. There is no motion in the universe without a cause. Because the motion of all things has a cause, recognizing this cause as the source of motion is also an important issue in philosophy. The so-called theory of internal causes and theory of external causes are also one of these recognition issues.</p>
<p>In philosophy, there are two different viewpoints: the theory of external causes and the theory of internal causes. In the view of external cause theorists, the movement of things is entirely due to external causes and bases. Things themselves have no movement and no basis for their own movement. All movement is only the result of the action of some force external to things. Things are completely in a passive position, dominated by this external force and moving. This theory of external causes is a pure theory of external causes, and there are two different statements in this theory of external causes. The first type of external cause theory is advocated in religious beliefs. They regard all things in the universe as the force of God acting behind them, and things can only change under the force of God. Things cannot change and move autonomously, because they have no automatic cause. For example, in feudal society, the rise of those autocratic emperors and the rise and fall of their dynasties were all attributed to fate in the old traditional thinking. Heaven intends to favor a certain surname or individual, and he can only gain the world if he gains that favor. When he loses Heaven's favor, he will lose the world. For example, people who generally superstitiously believe that there is a god in the dark often say, "Life and death are destined, wealth and honor are in the sky." This means that they regard the changes in people's poverty, success, life and death as being controlled by a god. Even the changes in wind, clouds, thunder, and rain are not the natural objects themselves moving and changing, but these gods are performing magic behind them. This theory of external causes is the oldest and most backward and still persists today among backward people. Another type is the mechanical external cause theorist. Although it is more scientific, it also recognizes that the movement of things is only the action of natural forces external to it that can cause this thing to move and change. Things themselves do not have the quality of development or qualitative change, or in other words, they only see the positional movement caused by external forces and do not see the qualitative change of things themselves. This theory of external causes is the viewpoint of natural science and philosophy before the eighteenth century. This is the case in Newton's mechanics. He only saw the mechanical and dynamic positional movement of matter but did not see the qualitative change of the evolutionary and historical development of matter. At the same time, from the mechanical view of natural science at that time, it also developed into the mechanical materialism of the eighteenth century. In the final analysis, this philosophy is also a philosophy of external causes.</p>
<p>Opposed to the theory of external causes is the theory of internal causes. It advocates that the development of things mainly depends on their own inherent dynamism and the source of the movement. Things are constantly changing their own nature in this way. They either completely deny external causes, or mostly regard them as unimportant. This theory of internal causes also has two largely similar methods of observation. One is the internal teleologist. They believe that every thing itself has its own absolute ability to dominate itself and has a purpose and plan. They automatically push themselves under the determination of their own purpose and constantly change and develop themselves toward a completely noble path. Of course, this development also changes its nature all the time, because it is a movement that gradually becomes perfect and moves toward the purpose of goodness. Another type of internal cause theory, although it does not explicitly advocate teleology as internal teleologists do, it similarly overestimates the role of internal causes and underestimates the role of external causes. They believe that only internal causes are the decisive role in the development of things. Even if external causes sometimes participate, these external causes are not very important and do not have a decisive and necessary effect. In its final destination, this statement will also become similar to the conclusions of internal teleologists, because external causes cannot have a decisive and necessary effect on the development of things. Then the development of each thing is not the result of the necessary effect of the cosmic natural law, this thing only independently decides itself outside the objective natural law, and the objective necessity has no relationship with the movement and change of things as viewed subjectively.</p>
<p>So, what is the scientific theory of internal causes and external causes? Only the dialectic that dialectically unifies the interactions of both internal causes and external causes can be regarded as a scientific theory of causation. According to the correct dialectical point of view, things have developmental movement. This developmental movement is inherent development. It is its own qualitative change, and it is fighting its own contradictions and opposites. It affirms itself and denies itself. Such movement is not only different from spatial movement that can only be seen externally and is obviously subject to the action of external forces, but also its own qualitative change is its own change, and its own opposition and contradiction and affirmation and negation are also expressing that it is moving. In particular, its own contradictions and opposites are the key factors as the driving force for its own development. Without contradictions and opposites, all development becomes impossible, and all external causes have nothing to exert their influence on its developmental movement. In addition, for external causes to play their decisive and necessary role on things and produce a movement effect, things must first have the dynamism and the reason for accepting its action. This phenomenon is the same in mechanical movement, because if the wheel is completely unable to move, no matter how much external steam and electric power there is, it will not be able to rotate it, which is of course. However, these automaticity and self-expression movements are inherent and embodied by themselves, so they are internal causes, and internal causes here have the significance of importance and decisive necessity. Not only that, the fact that the action of external causes must have internal causes as the basis proves that without internal causes, external causes cannot have a decisive and necessary effect on the movement of things. Therefore, we can say that without internal causes, there is no existence of external causes in individual things. External causes must be transformed into internal causes in order to manifest themselves in the cause of things.</p>
<p>The above is continued on the fifth page</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>The determined necessary effect, it is inconceivable to only talk about the inevitable determining effect of external causes.</p>
<p>However, vice versa, can the inner nature be completely independent without relying on the natural cause to establish itself, without relying on the determined necessity of external causes to have its own determined necessary effect, so that things can move and develop? Again, this is not possible. Because the universe is a whole and unified entity, there is nothing that can exist in isolation from all things and environments that always act as external and their effects. Since such things do not exist in themselves, then is it not ridiculous to say that it has a purely internal cause-determined movement of necessity? In reality, this is the case, the internal cause of things is also formed and determined by the external cause, and it is the result of the action of the external cause. The determined necessity of the external cause also determines the developmental movement of things, because it will transform into an internal cause and its determined necessity. It is very clear that a thing naturally has its inherent dynamism, but can it move solely based on its dynamism? And can it move along a certain necessary path? Can inorganic matter evolve into living things without a certain environment? If it is possible, then there should be living things on the sun. Even if Chinese society has the dynamism of possibly developing into a capitalist society, can it freely develop into a capitalist society or resist this path without developing capitalism in the current world environment of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? If it is possible, then why did it not form a capitalist society in the Qin and Han dynasties, or can it still close its doors and keep to itself, living its own self-sufficient economic production today? If we insist that this is determined only by the one-sided, its own internal, possible-to-develop-into-capitalism kind of dynamism, or that only this has a determined necessary effect, and the external cause of the world's environment has absolutely no determined necessary effect, then we can only explain that China also happened to develop a weak capitalism in the twentieth century and adapt to the entire world, which can only be regarded as a coincidence. Although we cannot agree with that simple theory of external causes and deny its inherent possibility, we also cannot simply advocate the necessary determinacy of internal causes and deny that external causes also have a determined necessary effect. All things have their inherent potential for development, have their contradictory and opposing self-causes, have their own affirmation, their own self-denial self-movement, but all of this also cannot, to be able to develop into contradictory opposites, self-affirmation, self-denial, etc., that is, to be able to begin movement, it must be subject to the action of objective causes. Although a grain of wheat turning into a wheat stalk and then turning into a grain of wheat must have this inherent possibility, and it is developing opposition and self-denial there, but if there is no appropriate external action during the rainy season, it can also become something that cannot grow or move! If we deny the action of external causes, or say that external causes have no importance, no determined necessity, then every thing can leave its own objective world and exist, move, and develop independently. Not only is the unified action of the universe divided, the universe becomes a disintegrated, single, jumbled world, becoming something without a unified law, but also the movement of these individual things will only be explained by internal teleology. Over-picking the theory of internal causes and suppressing the action of external causes is committing the same teleological error as that theory that denies the theory of internal causes or over-picks the theory of external causes. In short, the internal cause of the movement of a single thing is naturally the driving force of its movement. It is certainly a mistake for mechanists not to see the inherent developmental movement, but the entire correlation of the universe and its unified and comprehensive control of the developmental action and laws of a single thing must not be neglected. It also has determined necessity for the development of a single thing. All external causes can and must be transformed into internal causes to control things, and the internal cause of all things' own movement also becomes a part or link of the whole of the universe, and with this it forms an external cause and acts on things, and the internal cause is also transformed into an external cause with this. The universe is controlled by such interaction and dialectical development of internal and external causes.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Among the various provincial taxes, land tax and business tax rank first and second, respectively, while deed tax ranks third. These taxes have been handled according to the customs of the late Qing Dynasty. Recently, due to the promulgation of the Land Law, the contract item conflicts with Article 30 of the Land Law regarding land grades. Therefore, there is a trend that the contract cannot exist. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Lin, Li Tang, Gao Bingfang, and over a hundred others held a meeting to discuss the issue of the existence or abolition of deed tax. Both sides, for and against the existence or abolition, debated each other. The proponents pointed out that the deed tax is the best direct tax today, and it is related to the control of capital. Based on facts, they advocated for its preservation. The opponents pointed out that the deed tax has no historical basis, and there is no reason for its existence in terms of both facts and theory. A final decision is pending, and further discussions will be held next time. (4th Daily Dispatch)</p>
