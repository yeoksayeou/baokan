<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>第二從經濟制度方面來講，我們固然要提</p>
<p>高生產效率，促進分配公平，但是何以一定要</p>
<p>採用合作社的經濟制度呢？資本主義制度，共</p>
<p>產主義制度，以及其他許多的社會主義制度，</p>
<p>不都是說也可以提高生產效率，促進分配公平</p>
<p>嗎？關於這點可以說有五個理由：</p>
<p>一，集中與自由　集中有集中的好處，自</p>
<p>由有自山的好處，但均須有適當的限制，吾則</p>
<p>就會發生很大的流弊。合作社制度恰好折衷於</p>
<p>二者之間，旣不過於集中，又不過於放任，這</p>
<p>就是牠的長處。</p>
<p>二，公營與私營共產主義與社會主義主</p>
<p>張一切產業，皆須以公營爲原則，而資本主義</p>
<p>則主張一切產業皆以私營爲原則。其實公營私</p>
<p>營二者，亦各有其長處，合作社制度就是主張</p>
<p>相當公營與相當私營的。有許多事業，當然應</p>
<p>以合作方式由私人經營，但是也有許多事業，</p>
<p>如郵電鐵路輪船航空以及大規模的基本工業等</p>
<p>，顯然以公營爲最適宜。而且公營事業，旣亦</p>
<p>以消費者之利益爲最後目的，則與合作事業正</p>
<p>可並行不悖。</p>
<p>三，私有與公利，合作社產說屬於私人所</p>
<p>有，而其目的則爲公利。這就是牠的長處。因</p>
<p>爲在資本主義制度之下，旣私有又私利，固然</p>
<p>不好，而社會主義主張完全取消私有，似乎亦</p>
<p>大可不必。我們並不絕對反對公有，不過除了</p>
<p>必須公有的部分以外，如能以私有達到公有的</p>
<p>目的，不是更好嗎？</p>
<p>四，和平與激烈合作社制度的精神，是</p>
<p>和平奮鬥的精神。牠一面用和平的方法，另一</p>
<p>方面却又要逮到革命的目的，例如消滅商人階</p>
<p>級，贏餘攤還社員，種種皆是革命的辦法。但</p>
<p>又不像共產主義那樣的暴烈。</p>
<p>五，穩健與冒險別的經濟制度除少數例</p>
<p>外，大都主張立刻全部改造，改造的結果如何</p>
<p>，實仍在不可知之數，這是冒險的辦法，而合</p>
<p>作社制度則可逐漸推廣，自然發展，其穩健進</p>
<p>行，實亦一大優點。所以從經濟制度方面觀察</p>
<p>，合作社制度，也佔着很重要的位置。</p>
<p>第三，苒從中國的特殊情形來講，更覺得</p>
<p>合作事業的重要。農村的破產，不是可以應用</p>
<p>運銷合作信用合作利用合作購買合作等方法去</p>
<p>補救嗎？工商業的衰落，不是可以用消費合作</p>
<p>工業合作等方法去補救嗎？商店雖或有因合作</p>
<p>事業而受不良影饗者，但可設法將資本移轉於</p>
<p>其他用途。此外還有入超的問題，我以爲也很</p>
<p>可以得到消費合作的幫助。假使全國普遍成立</p>
<p>國貨的消費合作社，而半數以上的人口，叉都</p>
<p>加入消費合作社爲社員，我相信一定可以收到</p>
<p>相當的效力。</p>
<p>（三）合作事業的經營經濟</p>
<p>合作事業的經營經濟，自須視其所經營之</p>
<p>事業而異。概括的說起來，可以說有十個法則</p>
<p>，茲分述於後：</p>
<p>一，集中管理這就是要把許多小單位的</p>
<p>合作社聯合起來，成爲合作社的聯合社，庶</p>
<p>規模可以有相當的大，購買原料，運銷產品，</p>
<p>旣可省費，而廢物利用，也就可以沒有困難了</p>
<p>二，分析關係這是說要把一種事業有關</p>
<p>係的各方面，分析清楚的意思。例如辦理一棉</p>
<p>花運銷合作社，就要看那幾方面同他有運銷關</p>
<p>係。交通，種籽，包裝，紗廠，金融等等，都</p>
<p>同棉花運銷發生密切關係，應該兼籌並顧才是</p>
<p>三，替代使用合作社所用的職員，要從</p>
<p>各方面去觀察，假使有不好的地方，就要想法</p>
<p>子更調或替代。合作社所用的機器，或其他設</p>
<p>備，也要看他是否合用，如不合用，就應該拿</p>
<p>別的東西替代。</p>
<p>四，比例調和各種有關係的因素，都要</p>
<p>使他有比例的調和。合作社的設備與其工作之</p>
<p>問，就應該保持相當比率，如人數多而工作少</p>
<p>，則效率必减。叉如固定資本太多，而流動資</p>
<p>本太少，就活動不起來。在經濟學裏，有兩個</p>
<p>很普通的法則，一個是成本漸减法則，還有一</p>
<p>個是收獲漸减法則，按成本與收獲之所以漸减</p>
<p>，實在就是因爲前者得到調和，而後者失其調</p>
<p>和的緣故。</p>
<p>五，刪繁就　這無論在生產合作或消費</p>
<p>合作，均應加以法意。因事務如太複雜，即難</p>
<p>免紛亂，而多浪費。</p>
<p>六，减省人力用機器替代人工，是一個</p>
<p>减雀人力的方法，但工作支配及設備方式，也</p>
<p>都有關係。一切均須求其便利續是。而效用與</p>
<p>成本的關係如何，自亦須顧到。</p>
<p>七，探源治本　一切問題都要從根本方面</p>
<p>去設法救治，種籽必須改良，技術必須改進，</p>
<p>就是最顯明的例子。</p>
<p>八，控制心理例如辦理一個合作社，假</p>
<p>使把握不住社員的心理，不能使社員對合作社</p>
<p>發生興趣與信仰，這合作社就無法辦好。</p>
<p>九，利益均沾合作社的職員與工友，須</p>
<p>使其所得報酬·能與其實獻相等，吾則即失去</p>
<p>公平，亦即不能使彼等努力服務。</p>
<p>十，精密計算一切營業均有其預算與</p>
<p>决算。個別產品之成本與收穫的分析，允須加</p>
<p>（四）我國合作事業的過去與今後的推行。</p>
<p>合作事業的種類重要與經營方法，已略如</p>
<p>上述，然如何推行實成爲最切要的問題。合作</p>
<p>運動在中國已經有十多年的歷史。已經成立的</p>
<p>合作社，也在一萬以上。不過我們在過去的工</p>
<p>作，好像太偏重於數量的發展，祇知道把合作</p>
<p>社儘量的成立起來，假使對質量方面有過注意</p>
<p>，亦僅檢查其是否合法而已。我們今後的方針</p>
<p>，除了數量方面仍應求其增加外，似應特別注</p>
<p>重於質量的提高，要切切實實的去指導，使每</p>
<p>一合作社成爲一個成功的合作社：</p>
<p>第一，我們要使合作社社員，眞正能够合</p>
<p>作。</p>
<p>第二，我們要實行合作事業的計劃統制。</p>
<p>第三，我們要使生產合作與消費合作同時</p>
<p>並進。</p>
<p>第四，我們要使合作事業能根據經濟原則</p>
<p>經營．</p>
<p>第五，我們要促成合作事業的聯合與合作</p>
<p>網的造成。</p>

<p>程大使在柏林發表談話</p>
<p>柏林　中國新任駐德大使程天放氏、</p>
<p>於昨晚在大使館接見德國名界人士及外</p>
<p>國各報記者、乍懇切之談話、極力辦闢歐</p>
<p>西各國人士、對於中國一切情形之誤解、</p>
<p>渠謂現下歐美各國人士對於中國情形尚</p>
<p>有不甚明瞭者、以爲中國實係一半開化</p>
<p>之國家、此誠謬誤之甚、要知中國爲最古</p>
<p>國家之一、其一切政治·社會·經濟·文化</p>
<p>及技術上之組織及成就、已歷數十世紀</p>
<p>而未衰、自近世紀來、漸與歐西文明相接</p>
<p>觸頻繁、乃知其古傳之學術思想、其一部</p>
<p>實已不能適合現時代之要求、此在政治</p>
<p>方面允較顯著、職是之故乃有一九一一</p>
<p>年革命運動之爆發、推翻帝制獨裁、組織</p>
<p>中華民國共和國、卒於一九二七年成立</p>
<p>國民政府、奠都南京、自此以還、雖在內</p>
<p>憂外患交迫之下、然建設工作之努力、初</p>
<p>未稍懈、且反有極長足之越小不、在教育及</p>
<p>交通建設上、其成效更爲美滿、現中國</p>
<p>青年之游學於國外、以求學術上之深造</p>
<p>者都一萬餘人、政府年耗資於此、達二</p>
<p>千餘萬元、至最近數年來、全國之公路</p>
<p>網正使其早日完成、計已築成之新公路</p>
<p>達六萬餘公里、其已築而尚未完工者又</p>
<p>有四萬餘里、同時對於鐵路及航空方面、</p>
<p>亦多有添築及開闢、全國航綫之已正式</p>
<p>開航者已有九路、按中國之航空建設、尚</p>
<p>爲近十年來之事、今已有如此成績、殊感</p>
<p>可喜、至刻正在努力推行中之新生活運</p>
<p>動、其目的係在敎育巾國人民以一較有</p>
<p>規律及組織的生活方式、以期促進人民</p>
<p>之普遍幸福、</p>
<p>渠又續稱新近渠見某西報曾載有著論一</p>
<p>篇、對中國國民黨加以「全國波爾希維亞</p>
<p>化運動」之判斷、其實總觀中國國民黨黨</p>
<p>綱及其所主張之主義、並無一般的共產</p>
<p>主義色彩、此實爲歐美人士誤解中國社</p>
<p>會情形之最明顯的一例、所幸各邦有識</p>
<p>之士、業已了解東西文明初無軒輊可別、</p>
<p>而應相互聯繫並進、故渠極希望歐美各</p>
<p>界人士均能有此種態度及見解、以努力</p>
<p>促進東西各大國間之文化經濟及政治上</p>
<p>之提携云、（二十八日國聯電）</p>

<p>關於近日報載租界當局、對於界內徵收航空捐欵、橫加阻撓一節、頃據公共租界工部局發言人談話、公共租界當局對於界內徵收空捐、自始至終、從無反對之意、惟自去春汽車業開始空捐以來、警務當局以屢得乘客抗議、遂規定空捐一律樂輸、不得强制勒捐、嗣後舞塲·酒肆·旅館陸續舉辦、公共租界當局、亦一秉此旨、悉任顧客隨意輸將、其宗旨固在維持商業而免糾紛也、惟此後日久玩生、流弊滋多、即如舞塲之中、有自稱空會代表守駐門首、入塲即須付捐、或如酒菜館徵收酒食之資百分之幾老、旅館業中亦有勒收空捐之舉、警務當局屢接報吿、抗議此舉、經派探員調查屬實、各種强制勒索情形、殊難認為樂輸、不得不加以取締、惟在公共租界方面、尙未採取何種急劇步驟、亦無罰欵之舉、至航空恊會方面、工部局遠自去歲六月、即一再函達自由捐輸之旨、且前此工部局發佈關於此事之消息、亦一再提示此意、絕無反對之主張、所恐此事體大、範圍極廣、空會方面、一時糾察難周、轉滋弊端、亦未可知、租界當局極盼空會此後、能自行糾舉、顧全前此所承認不得强制之旨、則空捐旣屬中國市民自動愛國舉動、自必踴躍輸將、前途實利賴之矣、</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊申報兒童志願徵文我將來做怎樣的人  漢口市第十小學校陳紹英　　在這瘡痍滿目的中國，內受天災人禍的摧殘，外受列强隣國的壓迫，漸漸的由頹敗而迫危亡了。　　現在一般同胞們，還不知醒悟，只是糊裏糊塗，想自己做個快樂的人，發大財，　大官，光宗耀祖，安逸享福，這是對的嗎？假使國家亡了，還有福可享嗎？　　我是現在的小學生，國家將來的主人，我將來做怎樣的人呢？做屈原莎士比亞那樣的文學家嗎？不，中國不需要。做孔孟柏拉圖那樣的哲學家嗎？不，也不是挽救中國危亡的利器。我，我將來倒底做甚麽呢？啊！我將來决定要做個像愛迪生牛頓那樣的科學家呀！　　「二十世紀的世界，是科學的世界」。中國地位落伍的原因，不是文學，哲學，是萬能的科學。「一二八」戰爭的失敗，是飛機槍砲不及人。農工業的廢弛，是機械製造不精良，中國失業的人，成千成萬。但是聽說修橋造屋，還要請外國人，這是甚麽現象，不是缺乏科學人才是甚麽？　　此時的我，要鍜鍊强健的身體，養成良好的習慣，抱定堅强的意志，用「迎頭襲擊」的方法，去求有益於國的學問，以便將來做個國家所需要的人才！科學家。値得欽仰的補履先生  錢克昌　　　小朋友，你們可知道補履先生的事跡嗎？他雖是一個貧窮的履鞋匠，却有堅忍的志向，能耐勞苦，發憤讀書，故深得許多人欽仰，現在，讓我將他一生事業，告訴諸位吧！　　補履先生姓錢名近仁，淸朝時乾隆人，住在蘇州虎邱附近，他性情和藹，志氣高尙，可是家境貧寒，十分窮苦；在幼年，不幸父母雙亡，沒有依靠地方；生活更覺困難，不得已寄養在皮匠的家裏，幫助料理雜務，因爲他天資聰穎，不久就學會了補履的工作，從此他卽以補履爲業。　　生活很艱苦，當然無求學的機會了，但是他對於讀書，十分喜歡，一有空閒工夫，常拿書閱讀，細心地硏究，如有書中不明白的地方，隨卽摘記下來，刻刻向人求敎，明瞭之後，將省下的錢，分給人家，表示感謝，並借着勉勵自己，如此孜孜勤求，果眞不到幾年，他已讀熟不少書籍，學識豐富，博通古今了。　　後來，他見失學兒童很多，卽停止補履生活；在附近，開辦私塾，一時學生很多，他敎導兒童，不辭辛勞，學生中如有荒廢功課，他從不嚴責，常用好言勉勵他們，已致學生個個感化，勤讀不輟了。　　他旣好學，又能敎導別人，所以大家十分敬仰，都以補履先生稱之。他活到六十餘歲而卒，生平對於讀書工作，未嘗間斷一日。　　小朋友們！他這種耐勞和奮勉的精神，値得我們欽仰和效法啊！黃花岡  魏冰心　　　黃花岡上黃花栽，黃花岡下烈士埋。　　黃花晚節留芬芳，烈士勳功足愛戴。　　黃花落，黃花開，花落花開年年在。　　烈士一去不回來！嗚呼烈士一去不回來！　　黃花岡上黃花香，黃花岡下烈士坊。　　黃花傲骨耐霜雪，烈士英靈護祖邦。　　黃花謝，黃花放，花謝花放年年黃。　　烈士而今在何方？嗚呼烈士而今在何方？種牛痘  眞　　　春天到了，許多疾病又活動起來。敏兒的爸爸恐怕傳染病又要發生，尤其是天花，所以在星期日下午，請了一位醫生來替他們種牛痘。敏兒覺得種牛痘是不十分痛的，因爲他在學校裏已有好幾次種過牛痘了。他看見醫生從皮包裏拿出了一管牛痘苗，他便很客氣的問那醫生：　　「老先生，請問這牛痘苗是怎樣做的？」　　「小弟弟，你要知道牛痘苗怎樣做的，必須要知道它的來歷，我不妨從頭至尾的講些給你聽：發明種牛痘的是英國家賈納。在紀元一七九六年，他的故鄕盛行天花，他看見一個女僕曾經種了牛痘而不再出天花，於是他把女僕手上的牛痘接種在小孩的臂上，果然這小孩也不出天花了，因此他便知道了種了牛痘可以預防天花的。可是當時人種牛痘，不是咱牛痘，種的是人痘，就是把一人的痘苗種到另一人的身上，這樣非但不能多量的痘苗，並且還不免把別種病毒也同時傳染進去，於是經過許多人的研究，才發見了從牛體的一種痘苗製成今日普通所用的牛痘苗。　　至於製造牛痘苗的方法：先把剛生後三四個月的小牛，剃去了它腹部的毛，再將它皮膚先消毒一下，然後把皮稍爲弄破一些，塗上原苗，用紗布包起來，過了一星期方發生痘泡。到了這時候把痘泡的表皮剝去，用小匙刮下痘泡裏濃漿，再加些甘油等物，放在機器裡細細的研磨，便凝成乳白色的漿液，再要充分的檢査這漿液是否有效，才裝在玻璃管裏，這就是牛痘苗了。　　接種了牛痘後一二日，就漸漸的發紅發癢，二日到四日發生小泡，漸次脹而化膿。凡種牛痘的人，可以有十年左右不會出現天花。所以現在各國種牛痘由法律規定，分爲兩期，强迫施行。第一期剛生了三個月到明年六月之間，若種牛痘而不發的，那麽到第二年六月起，還要補種一次。第二期種牛痘「大約在十歲左右不發的，到明年十二月止還補種，可見各國對於種牛痘的注意了。」等到醫生說完了這話，方開始替敏兒種牛痘。放風箏要注意  顏鑫泉　　「日光」和「風向」　　時光過得眞快，不知不覺，又是放風箏的時候了。尤其是這幾天，天氣是那麽的融和，衹見天空中東一隻蝴蝶鷂在飛舞，西一隻蜈蚣鷂在飄蕩，……五花八門，很是好看！　　小朋友！當你看了那種形景，我知道你對放風箏這玩意兒就發生了很大的興趣，慌忙去買了篾哪，紙哪，綫啊，……很快的製成了風箏，到時曠塲去放吧　　雖然放風箏是一種應時的玩意兒，是很正當的娛樂，對於身心皆有莫大的益處，不過到放風箏的時候，有一件事，郤不得不注意，就是「日光」和「風向」！爲什麽呢？因爲「日光」和「風向」，對於人的眼睛很有一些關係！譬如上午放風箏，風向是向東吹：或者下午放風箏，風向是向西吹，那麽風箏和太陽是處在風一方向，我們的眼睛就要因觀望所放的風箏而受日光的照射，那麽我們的目光在亳不介意中已漸漸遭受陽光的損害了。因此，我們要注意上午發西風和下午發東風都是不宜於放風箏的。來呀！放鷂了啦！  （文譽揚）十分鐘的科學敎學做（二）  白桃　　　燒水的科學　　你可以不用手，直接用手拿住玻璃管，把管裏的水燒開麽？也許你要怕它燙手吧？是的，如果你拿住管頂，在管底　用火燒；管裏的水立刻就燒熱了。熱得使你拿不住。可是，如果你拿住管底下，你就可以把頂上的的水燒開，而手上並不覺得熱。這並不是什麽魔術。薩滿教是一個極簡單的科學法則。就是當水熱了之後，它的體積要比冷水大些，而要佔住更大的地方。所以用同樣大小的水，當它熱的時候，要比冷的時候輕些。因此，熱水會向上升，浮到冷水面上來。當你在管底下用火燒的時候，水熱了立刻就上升，而冷水下沉，如此循環的上下對流起來，不久　管的水就都　熱，熱得燙手了。可是，當你用火燒管頂上的時候，熱水老是浮在水面上；而冷水，老是停留在底上。所以不會燙手。這雖然是一個極簡單的法則，但製造大輪船上的蒸汽鍋爐，摩天大廈裏的熱水　裝置，和其他各種重要的器具上，都是要應用到它的。熱的空氣和熱水一樣，也是輕面上升的：倘若你在廚房裏或別種　熱的房裏，站到椅子或桌子上　；你就會十分驚奇的覺得，靠近天花板的空氣，多末熱　。原來，經過呼吸之後，呼出來的熱空氣，浮在房屋頂上。所以我們要使室內的空氣新鮮，一定要把窗戶頂上開開一些來，　用過的　空氣流出去。　　現在，我們要來談另一個關於熱的簡單法則。比方，你把　放在爐上燒，漸漸的水燒開了。如果開了之後，仍然放在爐上燒，是汪是可以燒得更熱一些呢？你可以用一隻溫度計來量它的溫度。不過，你不能用普通溫度計，或醫用的體溫計來量，因爲你　　進開水，它就會炸破。　　你量過之後，就發現水一經燒開，始終都停在同一樣溫度上，不會更熱。我們還可以向一個簡單的試驗來證明。請你先倒三杯冷水在碗裏，再倒一杯　　又開的熱水在裏面，把手放進碗去試試，熱得怎樣，現在你仍舊先倒三杯冷水在碗裏，再倒一杯剛剛燒開的沸水，用手試試，前一次是不是比這一次更熱些？不見得熱些。所以水燒開之後，　不會再熱。　　那末，那些用在上面的熱到哪裏去了呢？用到水變成蒸汽上面去了。水變成蒸汽飛升，是要吸取很多熱的。因爲這個事實，我們方可以用水來煮熱食物，烹調菜肴。這個簡單的法則，在節氣引擎上，也是很重要的。　　奇怪！管頂上的煙燒着了！　　奇怪！這鋼刀變成銅的了！　　（注意）這三幅圖是補刋的，請參看上期「十分鐘的科學敎學做」，便明白了。特載西湖兒童旅行團給全國小朋友的信　　親愛的小朋友們：　　現在讓我們來介紹一下我們自己。　　我們是十個孩子組織的一個旅行團，我們是杭州人，我們住在杭州的一個鄕下……翁家山，我們的學校，也就在這個山上。（中略）　　我們爲什麽不到別的地方去，先到上海去旅行呢？這有三個原因：第一，上海是我國文化和經濟的中心；第二，上海是直接受着帝國主義者壓迫的地方；第在，上海是各階層的人物聚集的地方。它是値得我們首先要認識的一個地方，我們認淸楚了上海，其他的地方，都不難認識了。　　我們這次爲了要試試我們離開學校，離開家庭，沒有父兄和師長領導，有沒有自治自理的能力，所以我們這一次旅行，是自動出來的，一切的生活，我們自己領導自己自己管理自己　　這一次的旅費，也是我們自己籌劃，自己掙來的。我們覺得平日吃父母的，穿父母的，用父母的，已經是很不安心了，現在我們再要他們拿出許多錢來給我們旅行，未免太說不過去，我們應該拿我們自己的力量來掙旅費才對。我們這一次的旅費，就是拿我們平日做小先生的日記，賣出來的稿費。　　記得在我們出發以前，村莊上的大人們，曾給我們不少的批評和譏笑！在他們看來，小孩除了吃和玩以外，是什麽都不懂，什麽都不會幹的！好吧！讓我們拿事實來打破他們這種輕視兒童的錯誤觀念吧！（中略）　　現在，我們是走上旅程了！我們熱誠的期待着你們的批評和指導！再會吧！祝你們發揮更大的力量，爲我們兒童界爭光！　　（附錄）我們旅行的目的　　　看看我國文化和經濟中心的上海，現在究竟是個什麽樣子。　　　看看帝國主義者究竟在怎樣侵略我國，壓迫我們。　　我們旅行的辦法　　　本團由我們自動組織一切由我們自治自理　　　本團决定用我們的勞力，換取我們的旅費　　　本團旅行時，當　時利用機會，學習各種智能。　　　旅行後，須將旅行心得及經過情形，寫成報吿，貢獻給全國的小朋友。　　　旅行後，須收集各種出品，開一旅行出品成績展覽會。　　我們的生活公約　　　每天開早會晚會各一次。　　　每天早操晚操各一次。　　　每天寫日記及參觀報吿各一篇。　　　每天主席記錄輪流擔任。　　　只有團體的行動，沒有個人的自由。　　（右）姊姊騎自由車　　（左）哥哥做童子軍　　（下）我只會滾鐵環　　八歲童兪自立作畫謎  張健　　小朋友！這裏有幅圖畫，你用鉛筆或鋼筆；從（一）起到（二五）的小黑點一一連起來，看是一個什麽玩意兒？　　本刋補獎啟事：郭成志，李梅松，權興，梅應璋，儲思勤，尹德堅，韓蘊，張炳生，陳秉卓，諸君監，敝館前寄兒童徵文獎品，均因無從投遞，業已陸續退回，茲請開明詳細通信地址，並親筆來信證明，以便核對筆跡，補寄獎品爲荷。　　申報兒童專刋部啟兒童園地黃花岡紀念的意義  萬竹小學六年級生郁元堃　　黃花岡紀念：就是追憶我們七十二位爲革命而殉難的英烈。他們要救中國，不惜流了許多寶貴的血，拼命去革命，精神是何等雄偉呀！　　我們要紀念先烈，不可在形式上表示哀痛就算了。要知道我們的國家，是革命先烈所先造成的；而未來國家的主人翁，就是我們現在的兒童；國家的重任，已漸漸的放到我們肩上來了。我們應該擔負這個重任，好好兒幹去，那才配做未來的主人翁；做了主人翁，應該努力做救國的工作，把國家治理得很好，那才對得住造成我們國家的先烈。如果做到了上面的第一步，方算有眞正紀念的意義。　　但是要做救國的工作，要負　國的重任，必須要有一個堅固的基礎才行。將來國家的主人翁旣然是我們，那末，我們現在就應當打下這個堅固的基礎。怎樣打這個堅固的基礎呢？就是我們要努力求學，鍛鍊身體，使人人都是　學多才，身健力强，立定志　做偉大的事業；並且要有高大的志氣，雄壯的毅力和勇敢的精神，像我們的先烈一樣肯去爲國犧牲。義狗傳（十三）  心靑　　　那時柯甘士回到了他的磨坊中，懷着滿腔的心事。當夜他對妻子說道：「那孩子不應當常常和我們的小愛洛在一塊兒玩，將來也許要惹起煩惱來的：今年伊只十二歲，而那孩子已十五歲了。他的面貌和身材都是長得很俊的。」　　他的妻子瞧着那松板上的畫像，答道：「他倒是一個好小子，並且很忠實。」柯甘士接口道：「是的，這個我也並不否認。」　　他的妻子慢呑呑地說道：「如此你要怎樣呢？只要這孩子有出息，他們倆將來能夠快快活活的度日，也就好了。」　　柯甘士把他的烟斗敲着桌子，很冷酷的說道：「你是一個女人，總是這樣　頭　腦的，那孩子窮苦得和化子一樣，况且他想弄這畫的玩意兒，那比了做化子更壞。以後你得留意着，不要使他們倆攪在一起，你要是不依我的話，那我就要把我們那女孩子送往聖心寺女尼那裏去了。」　　他的妻子一聽了這話，恐慌得甚麽似的，伊便答允依他的話做去。伊原不忍把女兒和伊愛好的小朋友硬拆開去，就是柯甘士自己也覺不忍把　手段去對付那可憐的小子，因爲他並沒有甚麽罪惡，不過是窮苦一些罷了。雖是如此，但他們仍用種種方法，使小愛洛和小南洛避面；小南洛雖然是一個孩子，而他是很乖覺很高傲的，他立時明白了這期間的用意，心中好　難受，從此以後，他在閒暇的時候，也决不帶着柏德希再到那山坡上的紅磨坊去了。　　他並不知道到底爲了甚麽事情，得罪了他們：也許是爲的那天在草場上給小愛洛畫像，惱了伊的父親吧。有時小愛洛捉空兒跑到他的身邊，把伊的手放在他的手中，他只憂鬱地向着伊微笑，柔聲說道：「愛洛，您可不要惱了您父親。他老人家不願意您和我同在一起，大概是爲了怕您怠惰的緣故。他是一位良善的父親而非常愛您的：愛洛，我閃可不要惱了他呢」　　他說出這些話來，心中是苦悶得甚麽似的，每天淸早日出時，他同着柏德希在白揚下的直路上走去時，頓覺得　　下地也沒有以前的光明和美麗了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊星期文學會「偶然文學論」的檢討  譚吉華　　在去年，日本文壇上發生了一個激烈的論辯，那便是「偶然文學論」的問題。首先提出這問題來的是中河興一和橫光利一兩人。中河與一發表了「偶然文學論」，「偶然之頌歌」等文章，橫光利一發表了「純粹小說論」等文。繼後各刋物上相繼發表了許多反駁的文字，例如森山啟的「小說論上的必然與偶然」便是其一，而在去　「唯物論研究」十月份上也有過本間唯一的一篇駁論。可是這問題在中國却還很少有人注意到。似乎在去年申報「自由談」上也有人論過，但不曾發生回響。　　偶然與必然這個問題本是哲學上的問題。在哲學上，許多觀念論的哲學者大多主張意志自由，反對必然而贊成偶然；但在另一方面，又有一派機械的物質論者却主張絕對的必然而完全反對偶然。在哲學上的派別反映到了文學上來，因而形成了「偶然文學論」。　　根據偶然文學論者的意旨，認爲自然主義的文學或寫實主義的文學全是機械的呆板的日常生活之記錄摹印，缺乏創造性，無戚動性。文學是戚情的奔放，是想像的飛騰，是慨性的發展。因爲這樣，偶然文學論者便以爲「支配字宙的一切全屬偶然。我們只能在其中發見蓋然。但這是蓋然而非必然。」（中河與一「偶然文學論之深化」）由於要文學創造的自由便把宇宙解釋作偶然，由於哲學上宇宙觀的偶然性，反轉來又奠定了文學上偶然性的基石，而强化了偶然文學論。　　自然，偶然文學論者所說，也有値得贊同的一部分。例如在橫光利一的論文中，牠其所以能得一般同感的，是在於不僅注意生活中必然所演的任務，而且注意偶然所演的任務。如果小說上漠視了偶然，那就太貧乏化了。橫光利一在申訴了「偶然愈帶現實性，則表現上愈不感困難」之後，又說道，「日常生活的感動，偶然更多。固然我們往往是有計劃地行動，我們發生最强烈的感動時，往往也是在現實之一般的進行上，發生了我們所預期的事件；但是因爲偶然發生的事象這種偶然性，因而引起强烈的感動，這大半也是事實。要是在實生活上任何偶然的事件也不發生，碰不着任何沒有預料着的事件，那也是沒有趣味的。如果什麼都是照樣地爲神的意志所預定，無論事物與人類都一直行着一絲不亂的安排好了的軌道，那末世界便完全用不着人力去創造開拓了，這全是宿命論者的見地。在實生活本身中？偶然是有其客觀的意義的，人人都受過偶然的作用，而且也喜歡牠的刺戟。何况在小說上，如果偶然的任何波紋也不發生，那當然更是乏味。　　橫光利一輩是浪漫主義者，凡是「偶然文學論」者都是文學上的浪漫主義者。從浪漫主義的見地，是耍創造比現實世界更爲豐富美麗的世界，「可能的世界」。是的，我們也認爲那跟着自然主義的尾巴走，只是選取日常性，對於生活只能與以懷疑，無力，只是重複着寫實主義的口號，像這樣的變質了的「寫實主義」，只足以摧弱文學。只是一些隨感錄，自己的吿白，沒有鼓動我們的力量，這樣的文學當然是沒有一點趣味的。因爲現實的世界是包羅萬象，非常複雜，變化多端。而實際的人生則更有着非常豐富的事象，有着千萬不同的人所有之曲折波瀾的　遷。實際的人生較之任何小說上都有着「新奇的」束西。活生生的歷史是有着波濤般的各色各樣的現象的，人類性是多種多樣的，事件是紛繁重疊的。　　但是，我們却並不同於「偶然文學論」者。宇宙和實際的人生不怕是怎樣的變化複雜，但不能全無法則可尋，全是偶然的雜呈。在歷史的洪流中，在奇特瑰異的波瀾中，在這若干的偶然中，理藏着必然。文學便要把握着這諸多偶然背後的必然，描寫這必然性。舉例說，「戰爭與和平」，「靜靜的頓河」，「毀滅」，「巳開發的處女地」等小說，無論翻譯到那一國，都頗受大衆的歡迎，允其是顧拉特哥夫的「士敏土」。我們决不能說，大衆之所以對某些作品感到趣味，是由於他們只有卑俗的興味，或者至少只能以興味爲本位去讀牠，那是胡亂輕蔑了他們。就拿「士敏土」來說，我們在這上面可以找出很豐富的事象，「新奇的」束西，頗足以引起讀者大衆的興趣，但是牠决不是信筆所之地偶然地創作出的作品，牠是熟習了當時新俄過渡時間一切的社會發展，並把握了那社會發展之必然的法則。所以牠描寫的事象不怕是怎樣地風雲　變幻，如黛莎與格利夫妻問之出乎意外的反常，如賊黨之如何破壤建設工程，但每一奇特的事變背後都有必然的法則連絡着在，而且必然地指示出諸種事象之不可避免的歸結。看到末尾，我們威到非常的興奮，如像參加牠所描寫的那種洪流。這就是牠把諸多偶然用必然來貫穿了的。我想就是「偶然文學論」者自身，不怕他們主張偶然地描寫，任性地創作，但是如要他的作品眞能感動人，眞爲大衆所接受，那一定是描寫的一種實際的人生，一定有其社會的背景，决不是脫離了或超越於一切實生活之上的幻夢。文學作品耍是只偶然地描寫，對於歷史之一般的進行沒有本質的意義，便成無力化，便不受入歡迎。未必文學作家在創作之先，在寫作的過程中，對於他所要寫作的作品沒有一些計畫安排吧？不是要想在自己的作品中表現出一件或各種事件之因果關聯，首尾一貫嗎？作品本身之必然的發展便反映出作者本身目的意識性地描寫，作者目的意識性地描寫同時反映出實際生活的規律性。如果忽視了這必然性，便與那不把客觀世界本身中的生活興事件的多樣性和複雜性取入作品，是同樣無趣味。就是個人的經騐也是社會生活的反映呢！　　「偶然文學論」者不敢正視客觀世界之必然性，因爲客觀世界之必然於他不利。因此他們只有遁入主觀的恣意的幻想中，在浪漫的世界中尋快樂，完全失掉了浪漫主義初期的蓬勃有力的精神，這是　落期的歿落羣的意識形態的一種表現。</p>

<p>生活汽車夫  有根　　　記得我進那家大公館當「小汽車夫」的那年，年紀才不過十歲，人長得也不比汽車的「水箱」高。剛進去的第一天，那家的汽車夫王師父便叫我跟他到一間小房子裏，那裏放着一輛汽車，他指着說：「那邊有一雙橡皮靴子，你拿下來穿了，再去把橡皮管子接上，我來敎你洗這部車子。」　　我照着他的吩咐，爬上　，拿了靴子和蛇般的紅橡皮管子下來；靴子給我穿上了，接好了皮管子，對着車子沖洗了一陣。王師父抄着兩隻手看着，指東說西地釘着我一處一處地揩拭，然後給了我一塊乾布和一鐵盒子的擦車油，叫我細細地擦着；車油擦過的地方，便都現出亮光來，照着人像一面鏡子。王師父抽着烟，坐在一邊瞧着，臉上露出一絲的笑意，我看在眼裏也自有一種說不出的快樂。過了二個鐘頭的模樣，車子全部揩擦好了，王師父才站起身來看了一下手錶，又沿着車子四周巡視了一圈，拍了一下身上的烟灰，安閑地望着我說：「以後作事也要照這樣子我才歡喜！快把靴子脫掉，我領你去見「老闆」去。」　　他說一句我應了一句，身上兀自還在淌着汗，可是心裏仍舊是一團高興。　　老闆這時還祇剛從床上爬　，　差的出來　。王師父預備車子。他聽說老闆起來了，連忙跟着當差的一道走進去，我便在草坪上候着。一會　他帶有高興的樣子出來，吿訴我說：「老闆答應了用你，一個月給你三塊錢，在這裏吃飯睡覺，不許回去。」　　一個月有三塊錢，我聽了這麽說，眞要高興得跳起來。他說了這話，便又叫我跟他到車間裏，拿出一隻洋鐵箱一條鐵管子，叫我蹲下來扶着，他才把車身後面一個螺旋的鐵蓋子揭開，把管子放進去，抽出裏面的汽油來。我當時看在心裏有點茫然，但又不敢問他，仍舊低着頭瞧着洋鐵箱子。一會兒，鐵箱的油漸漸滿了，我才敢開口說：「師父，油快冲出來了。」　　「輕點兒，說話！」他臉上現出不高興的樣子，把鐵管子拿掉，旋上蓋子，又釘着我說：「小孩子不要多說話，知道麽？」　　他把那一箱油送到車子裏放好了，叫我跟他坐上汽車，嗚的一聲開出去，在路上轉了几個灣，便停放在一家小車行門首，祗把油提進去就回到汽車上開回來了。　　下半天吃了飯，老闆叫師父開車要出去，他回答說沒有汽油了。老闆似乎有點不相信的樣子：「怎麽？五加侖油還沒有用多久就沒有了嗎？」　　他滿不高興地冲着老闆說：「老闆不相信儘管去瞧，看是油沒有了不是？」　　「不用瞧了，趕快把車子開出去買好了！」老闆遞過一捲鈔票給他，反身進去了。　　王師父臉上高興了，又叫我跟他出去，仍舊到剛才那家車行加了油，拿了一張賬單回來給老闆看了，老闆這才跳上車子。　　老闆每天下午二點鐘到交易所，直到四點鐘才出來，差不多成了他的慣例；這天王師父送他到了交易所後，照例把車子停在一邊，走到別的一輛車子閑談去了。我獨自在車子裏睡了一覺，醒來時師父還沒有來，我便跳下車去找他，找了几輛車子，才看見他在那邊一輛篷車裏和另外兩個人「吃亨」——撲克牌的一种——。我悄悄地走過去看着，袛見他面前放着的几張鈔票和老闆給他買汽油的沒有兩樣，我當時心裏才明白了他把油放出來的内幕了。　　在那裏做了兩年，老闆見我做事勤快，有一天便叫王師父敎我學開車，他聽了這話自然很高興，因為這裏面又有「一票」汽油可撈。第二天一早他帶着我把車子開到一條僻靜的馬路上，開始學起來。學了三天，他見我已經會了，便叫我獨自把車開到×××××去考「照會」。　　考「照會」的地方是一塊曠場，地上橫七豎八地插着許多樹樁，每一對樹樁的距離僅祇夠車身通過，稍為歪斜一點便會把樹樁衝倒，「照會」也就沒有希望。第一次我把車開到那裏，因為什麼門檻都不懂得，袛照規矩報了名。接着一個西人和一位「同胞」叫我把車從新由外面開進來，經過一個樹樁，超前走了几十步，又聽見西人叫打倒車退回來，朝南轉灣又走進　個樹樁裏，一個不小心，樹樁被撞倒了。我心裏兀自　了一跳，袛見那位西人和「同胞」走過來，指着我說：「小鬼！車子沒學好，考啥個「照會」！快回去，過　禮拜再來考。」　　我悻悻地把車開回來，師父問我考試的情形怎樣，我把撞樹樁的話都說了，他聽着笑了起來：「下禮拜你再去考，保險「照會」可拿到手。」　　第二次我帶五塊錢在身邊，把車開去報了名，這一次仍由那個西人關照開車的路綫，我趁便就照師父的話做了，他微笑地望着我點了點頭，把手一揮，我就跳上車，打了倒車朝西退進去，停了一停，他又把手一揮叫我朝西轉灣一直向前開了出來，考「照會」的手續就是這麽辦完了。　　把「照會」拿到手，我的事更多了，除了洗車子，有時還要代替師父開車；不過這麽一來，工錢倒一下就加了十塊。　　主人外面應酬很多，每天都有不同的局面，但我認為最好的是他玩「堂子」或是跳舞。因為這兩種玩意都是姨太太懸為例禁的，他要在外面玩，就祇得偷偷的幹，可是對於我們却仍是沒有方法隱瞞，所以他在外面玩一次，我們便有几元的進賬。有時他上「總會」羸了錢，我們也可以拿幾元，不過這是沒有把握的。　　在那家公館裏很順利地做了五年多，後來因為害了一塲重病，兩隻脚的力氣少到連「風門」也踏不動，老板才把我生意辭了。歇了不久，聽說公共汽車要招考「司機員」：我得了這個消息，便輾轉地去託了朋友介紹，花了二十大元，才得報了一個名上去。以後每天都要跑到公共汽車公司門口的茶館裏，泡了一壺茶，坐在那裏聽候考試的消息；這麽過了一個禮拜，名單總算發表了。　　主持考試的是一個西人，另外還有一個中國人擔任翻譯。當面試在這位中國人的几句英語里完畢以後，他發給了我一張保單和騐身證的通知單。騐身證的「醫生間」是在二樓，裏面有兩個醫生；走進去交了通知單，就把上身的衣服脫掉，一個醫生便在我胸前敲了幾下，又拿着聽筒聽一回，然後才察看下身，如果生過花柳病的就沒有希望。身體看過沒有問題，才得試騐眼力。試騐方法是在墻上掛一張像地圖般大的硬紙，上面橫七豎八的都是些「E」字，大小共有七種。受試的人站在距離約一碼的地方，先閉起一隻眼睛，醫生便走到那張硬紙跟前亂指一陣，叫你迅速的說出某個「E」字是向着某個方向，如果稍一遲疑，就會有被擯棄的可能了。　　剛進去時的工錢祗有二十五元一月，外加三天賞工；以後每六個月加薪一次，約有　元。另外如開車能依照規定的時間，一個月中間沒有一次誤點，那也有五六元的賞錢可得；每大車子賣的銅板若能超過公司規定的標準數目，也有所謂「銅板賞」可領。　　我進去了兩個多月，第二個月裏便拿到了各種賞錢，一共有四十多元。到後來「門檻」精了，每天還要向賣票的拿四角或六角，因為他沒有我們帮他的忙，也就無「油」可「揩」了！我們給他帮忙的手段很多，隨時都可以應用。譬如他正在「揩油」，突然前面站上發現了「查票」，我祇要把「軋車」輕輕一軋，他便好做準備，「查賣」上來後就沒有什麽過錯可找了。有時遇着上下寫字間的時間，我便隨時把車子開快或開慢，總以能多裝客人為原則；因為客人一多，「賣票」方好從中施展手段。不過有時客人多而恰遇着「查票」的上來查票，那我便把車子開得顚簸起來，使「查票」的沒有方法執行他的職務，這也是一种變相的帮忙呢。專論一個敎育問題  志　　學校敎育的糟糕與墮落，莫甚於上海特區。鄉村敎育的不發達，牠的缺憾僅屬於客觀原因的存在，而上海特區中充斥的衖堂學校，則除其客觀原因外，更有其主觀原因的墮落。本來上海市的敎育根本就成了畸形的姿態。全市人口密度旣如此大，學齡兒童數又如此多，而公立學校却那麽少。在特區内，其情形更劣於市區，總計市立小學及局立公學還不足二十所。為了這個病因，又加上智識份子的過剩，上海特區的衖堂學校就成了他處所不易見的特殊繁榮現象。　　這種衖堂學堂幾乎每一衖堂都有，甚至有一個衖堂中設有二個三個的。參觀其内容，除少數稍有歷史，學生數額較多的學校略有設備外，大都只租一幢或二幢房屋，樓上樓下均設有窄隘的敎室，且其人數與所佔容量之比例亦殊不相稱，至於設備則竟至「無從說起」。這無疑的是决定於經濟條件，因為學校的全部收入全賴學生的繳費，大部分旣已充了房租，自然無從談到設備的改善。在同一情形下，敎職員的待遇亦大多異常的低劣，低劣得甚至難得一飽的機會。其衣食尚不足以謀無虞，而欲責其盡瘁於敎育兒童，事實上殆不可能。　　設校者中，除少數半公立的如什麽同鄉會或什麽公會工會設立的，或有相當資源的補助外，多數是沒有出路的敎師商人等，他們僅有很小的資本供學校的開辦，到後如何維持學校的經常支出，則完全有賴於學生的增多，同時他們幾都有一個信念：希望學生日多，俾每年除了開支以外可以有點羸餘。但許多已吿失敗的經騐吿訴我們：能實現這個希望的百不一見。　　雖然，這种信念永遠不會使他們忘懷的，他們仍盡最大的努力，從事於招生的工作。於是採取了以下幾種方式的一種或數種：　利用廣吿效用（如滿街滿衖的招貼）。　减費。　介紹—這與减費有連帶關係的，但却更進一步，因徒然减費還未見能增多學生，於是便着重於積極的「介紹」方式。其辦法：凡介紹學生一名得什麽利益，兩名得什麽利益，三名得什麽利益，總之介紹人數愈多，其所得利益也愈厚，所謂利益，自然是物質的利益。至於介紹人，則大都限於學生或學生家長，但也有不限于學生或學生家長的。　吸收他校學生—若在鄰近學校較多，很有機會採用這一種方式的，他們便不用正當的方式去吸收學生了，而籠絡指使他校的學生領袖或其學生家長，鼓動多數學生脫離原校，允其在採用此種手段的學校裏享受某種特殊優益。在這種方式之下，有一校與一校相互玩弄手段的，亦有聯合數校共倒一校的。此外如允許學生躍級，濫發文憑，也是他們吸收學生的一種重要方法。　　卽此數種，吾人不能不肯定此種主觀原因的墮落將為敎育界的莫大恥辱。此種事實的存在，吾人旣不能否認，同時敎育經費缺乏，不能將這一般私校收歸公立，也為事實上的情形。但我們不能為了這個原因就認為不能整理私校。　　消極方面，敎育當局已有登記立案的手續，但登記立案手續的效力不能完全改革腐化的私校，並且未登記未立案的私校事實上也沒有受到未登記未立案的若何重大損害，卽已立案已登記的私校中，是否卽無腐化的墮落行為，實亦難以保證。所以我主張除這消極辦法外，各界領袖，民衆團體或敎育當局亟宜有積極的有效方法澈底整理現有的一切衖堂私校。茲就管見所及，建議如下：　　一，歸併　前江蘇第四中山大學行政區時代，整理全省中學，曾為充實設備，提高效率起見，歸併類同的數校，成一規模較大的完善中學，如現省立下中，卽由前省立二師，省立商專及二師附中等數校併合而成，其成效殊大。根據同一理由，我也主張在可能範圍内歸併各衖堂私校。如同一衖内有二個單級學校和一個二級學校，應當歸併成為一個較完善的小學，一方面可以節省共通的經費，一方面卽以之充實學校設備　　　至於各學校中各校主在歸併以後的產業權及其他主權問題，看來似屬實際上的困難問題，其實其解决方法亦甚易。合併後，各校生財可估計價値，作為新校產中幾股，不容諱言的援用合資公司辦法，作為股份額。至於主權問題，其癥結點恐在新校長的如何產生一問題。此問題的解决方法，一為各界領袖，民衆團體或敎育當局於合併各原校校長中遴選合格的充任，二為杜紛爭起見，得另行遴選合格人員充任，而負一切改善及充實該校的責任。如果每一區域有這樣一所優於其他未歸併學校的較完善的學校，則其發達自可預必，且其他各校勢必受制於此新校，甚至被淘汰於競爭之中。　　二，建設　如能依上述觀點完成其任務，則新私校無異公立校或半公立校，而其他簡陋私校將無由施其技倆，學生家長對學校的信仰當日深，學生人數的發達當日盛，而且對於將來的發展與充實，亦可以行政力量或其他力量予以帮助，如需要較寬大的校舍，在私校本身决無能力辦到，這時行政當局或各界領袖工民衆團體可於附近有新建市房時與地產商交涉，在其所建市房中另建一部分較合於學校應用的房屋，以充學校之用，房租等等不妨與一般房客同其負担，但其適用與否當因此得謀解决。這樣在事實上也並不是無辦法的。書報介紹介紹「永生」週刊  呂樹聚　　　—定價每冊四分，上海愛多亞路永生週刊社發行—　　「又出版了一個「永生」週刋！」大家都在這樣說。眞的，這刋物有値得我們注意的地方。當我們翻開它的「創刋號」時，馬上就有一篇作為「創刋詞」的文章映在眼睛裏，那便是該刋編者金仲華先生的「求「生」之道」。這是一篇頗言時宜而且內容充實形式活泼的文字。在這中間，作者首先提出了兩個問題：「個人的求生的道路」和「民族的求生的道路」。關於前者，他在指出「在狂濤一樣的時代潮流裏」，個人的弱小和容易死滅之後，接着就下面地表明了就在這樣「在狂濤一樣的時代潮流裏」，個人也有求得生路的絕對可能。他說：「在狂濤一樣的時代是人類自己造成的；人類要解除一切厄運的威脅，也只有靠自已的努力。一個人的力量是渺小的，兩個人的力量就大了些，許多建全的人聯合起來就會發生非常的力量。這樣的聯合叫做團結；這們的團集產生了建全的集團；在建全的集團之中，個人的力量就和團體的力量發生有機的作用，可以抵抗一切的恐慌和威脅。」又說：「一個人生活在建全的集團中，他的生命就和集團的生命成為一體，集團的精神繼續就是個人的永生。」隨後他又反過來指出：「一個人若從建全的集團中分離出來，背叛出來，他的生命即使苟且保全着，事實上是等於不存在了。」關於「民族的求生道路」，他是提出了這樣的原則：「許多被壓迫的弱小民族可以聯合起來，造成一個偉大的力量；而這种偉大力量的發揮則在於繼續不斷的鬥爭。」隨着更斷然地說：「被壓迫的弱小民族不從自覺的鬥爭　，就是茫然漠然地被摧　　滅的道路。」我以為這篇文章所站的立場是很正確的。　　「永生」週刋是一個現實的綜合的小型雜誌，它向我們供給了多方面的知識。在已出版的三期中，我們可以看到如下的幾類文字：關於當前發生的重大問題的短評，中國和日本的以及中日的問題的分析，國際時事解說，時代知識的探討，國內外通訊，人物描寫，小說，其他。現在我且提出其中的幾點重要內容來作個簡明的說明和批判。　　該刋在牠的「每週評論」一欄中特別注意如何振興弱小民族的精神。例如，第二期中的「阿比西尼亞沒有失敗」一文便是根據這個目的寫成的。誰都知道，弱小民族與弱小民族間彼此都有情感的交流作用。當阿國不畏強敵全國總動員抗戰的消息傳來時，大家是多麽的興奮；當阿軍打勝戰的情報傳到中國時，大家又是多麽的狂喜；但最近阿軍在唐比安劇戰中打了一個大敗戰，而帝國主義的通信機關更將這事誇大起來，說阿軍全軍覆沒了，阿國馬上就要遭滅亡之禍，這樣在報紙上用大號字登出來時，的確有不少的人因看到這消息而垂頭喪氣的。然而這篇「阿比西尼亞沒有失敗」却從意大利的侵略情形，阿國的國勢，阿軍抗戰的精神和其經過與影響，以及唐比安區的敗退之嚴重程度，事實地證明了阿比西尼亞並未失敗。此外，還有「南北侵略的並進」與「倫敦「中國民衆之友會」的　議」，都是和「阿比西尼亞沒有失敗」同一旨趣的文字，都是値得一讀的。　　除了這些短的評論外，還有几篇較長的與我們當前嚴重的民族問題有深切關係的文字，但因篇幅關係,恕不一一介紹了.　　關於「二·二六」東京的非常政變，在已出版的三期「永生」中，有四五往篇文章來說明。「創刋號」的「從東京政變談起」，「東京政變與日本的新聞檢查」，第三期的「從五·一五到二·二六」……等文，對於這個問題都有具體的正確分析；我們讀了之後，不僅可以了解此次震動世界的東京政變本身，而且可以明白日本的國家社會實情。這些都是當「中日問題」幾個字深印在每一個中國人的腦中時値得我們特別注意的文章。　　時事硏究的文章，在「創刋號」中有「英日在華南的爭鬥」，這是具體地從經濟·軍事上說明了英日在華南爭鬥的實情。文字的內容很充實，使我們能具體明瞭英日在華南的衝突情形。在第二期中有「目前國際形勢與中國」（錢亦石），這篇文章雖會一一解說了法德·英意·日美·英日等國間的矛盾，但却未將國際的各種矛盾綜合起來，對國際形勢作個總的分析，總的判斷，使我們發生了美中不足之感。不過，在第三期的「未來大戰和我們」（張促實）中，對於這個缺陷却作了這樣一個部分的原則的補充：「在現階段上，國為資本主義的矛盾日趨複雜錯綜，國際關係的發展也一天天變為混亂嚴重了。未來世界大戰的性質，我們很難加以區別：在帝國主義進攻蘇聯的戰爭中，同時也包含着帝國主義內部的戰爭；反之，在帝國主義內部的戰爭中，同時也包含着帝國主義反蘇的戰爭。這便是目前國際形勢發展的一個主要特點。」我不知道這見解是否正確，但有人認為這分析在原則上是對的，隻是好像還欠具體一點。　　探討一般新知識的文字，我們可以舉出「創刋號」的「如何獲取時代的知識」（王紀元）和第三期的「科學和民衆生活」（克士）來。不過，前者隻是原理的說明，缺乏實際性和具體性；後者也只是歷史地表明了科學的進步，指出要在未來時代中科學才能和民衆親近，要大家努力，却並未切實地叫大家去獲得科學知識，在科學知識的指導下去努力，當然更未說明如何去運用科學知識；所以說來這兩者都有缺點。希望「永生」今後在這一方面多多留意和努力。　　我很喜歡「非常時期的時事圖解」，這是以圖　和文字來解說與我們最有關係的問題的，所以它能給讀者以更明白更深刻的印象。這可說是「永生」的特點之一。　　還有，國內的外通訊，使我們能實際地知道各地方的情形，這當然是必要的；但依我看來，「永生」的國內外通訊似乎多了一點，如第三期就有四篇這類東西，幾乎佔去了一大半的篇幅。這是在編輯上値得商議的。　　此外還有人物描寫，特載……等文字，我們都很喜歡；特別是如像「印度民族解放運動領袖尼赫魯給他女兒茵蒂拉的信」那樣的東西，對於我們尤有重大的意義。希望「永生」編者能繼續多刋載一些這類的材料。至於小說，我以為「創刋號」中的「丁祭」（聖陶）很好，並且很與「永生」讀者的要求相合；第二期許傑先生的「出走」似乎寫得不很成功，而且也看不出一個所以然來。——這些都因為我們愛護「永生」才誠懇指出的。　　如果總括起來說，第二期，特別是第三期是沒有像「創刋號」那樣好的。這原因便在於第二期第三期是更少正面地討論現實問題，過多通訊之類的文章，使人看起來內容不如以前的充實樣。這或許是因為我們看慣了「永生」的前身，所以才發生這樣的感覺吧。但為了愛護它，我們總希望「永生」能更加充實起來。事實上，不是已有讀者致函「永生」希望多載關於國內時事的論文嗎？我以為「永生」編者是當特別考慮這問題的。還有，在叙述一種現象時應該批判地叙述，不當平板地講說：如「廣西的三自政策」一文便犯了平板講說毛病。作者徐了在文未表現一點主觀意見外，在全篇中毫無批判態度，使讀者對於這問題不能有充分的認識。這也是希望「永生」注意的。　　不過，在目前情形下，「永生」總算是難得的好的刋物。假使朋友們要想看什麽刋物里，我就介紹他去看「永生」。雜文病態的少女  胡英女士　　　『喂……喂，你們是×公館嗎？請少爺聽電話。』　　『喂……你是×姊嗎？』　　『是的，×弟，今天姊姊的病體怎樣啦？』　　『姊姊嗎？……已經在前天死……了……！』　　『喲……！』我擱上了聽筒，不由的流下了兩行珠淚，想起我那舅父和舅母，對於他們的愛女不吝掌上名珠，眞是風吹肉也痛，現在玉碎珠沉，不知兩位老人家要傷心到怎樣地步哩！我是一個小輩，旣然得悉了這樣不幸的事，應該要去問候和勸慰的。　　上樓去披了大衣，一面扣鈕，一面囑咐兩個學生，不許因我出去而亂跑（那時我正在一家公館中任敎師）出門坐上街車，說明了到××路，那車夫便提起兩條毛腿向前飛跑。我在車上只是不斷的沉思着，同時回憶便把我佔領了。　　記得從小媽常和我們說，大舅父家有一個表妹，是和我同庚而小三個月，她自糼生得玉雪可愛，並且聰穎過人。可是，我的爸爸和舅父都是在宦途中奔走，雖然不至關山遠隔，却至少也是咫尺雲天，所以我自從三四歲懂得人事以後，也始終沒有見過表妹，僅不過耳聞媽媽說起，和心靈中幻想着一個「安琪兒」罷了。　　在我十七歲的那年，恰巧遇到外祖母的冥壽，因此就隨着媽媽到上海來，拜見了舅父和舅母，同時也識荊了這位天仙化人的表妹。當她第一次映入我的眼簾時，只見她弱不禁風的身予差不多比我小了一半，吹彈得破的嫩臉上白得連血素也沒有，配上一雙似開似閉的杏眼，　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>從櫻口中發出來的聲音也　比蚊虫還要細、啊，我自慚形穢了，在對面大鏡中映着我那粗黑的臉，不很細巧的身段，簡直不像是個溫柔體貼的女子，相形之下，眞使我無地自容·那時好像一個小偷兒似的把視綫轉移到舅母的臉土，看她正自覺得愛女的出人頭地而得意洋洋，而且還不絕地炫耀着女見的學問呢！但是，關於學問，我雖不敢自逞其能，不過眼看着捧得她這樣高，心裏也有些不甘示弱起來，就隨便和表妹談了些關於文章詩賦一類的話。　　後來我也在上海服務了，和表妹也常常見面。可惜她雖是「蘭心蕙質」，却同時也是「工愁善病」，實在和瀟湘妃子不相上下。差不多終年躱在樓上，難得有幾次要出去應酬，可是一出門就坐的汽車，在家中也整天幽居在屋子裏，連窗子都不敢打開，深恐風來吹壞了她，眞可說是永遠接觸不到太陽。一年到頭，吃的是稀飯，因爲生怕不消化。三天倒有兩天睡在床上，如果有些頭痛身熱，房中除門窗緊閉，帷幕低垂之外，再加繡屏錦幛，重重疊疊，極盡避風之能事。假使你站在床前和她說話時，你非得要屏氣低聲不可，以免她受驚嚇。至於煎藥的氣味，那更是一年之中難得有幾時沒有的。　　同時又想起一星期之前，我到××醫院中去看她（也是病到中醫束手了纔進醫院的），只見她面色慘白而帶浮腫，氣息好像遊絲一般，見我來了也只把眼皮略抬了一下，微微點點頭。我怕太勞她的神，便和舅母談了幾句話，吿別回來，誰知僅僅一星期，就此人天永隔呢！　　「到了！」車子猛然一停和車夫的大聲說話，綫把我從回憶中喚醒過來。　　我問明了老爺太太都在樓上，也不待娘姨去通報，就逕自上去。掀開門帘，看見舅父沒精打彩的躺在沙發上，舅母一手支頤，坐在桌邊，好似在沉思什磨，但已瘦得形消骨立了，表弟呢，也垂頭喪氣的站在一旁，又加上微雨的天氣，眞有些滿目凄凉，不禁一股酸辛襲上我的心頭，只開口呌了一聲，第二句話就咽住在喉頭，再也說不出來了。舅母一見我更是放聲痛哭，好容易勸住了她，說了些「修短有數」等勸解的話，然後再談到表妹的病源，舅父便一聲長嘆的說道：「唉！二十三年撫養，可謂無微不至，金錢心力，兩俱盡矣，所恨者，未曾早就西醫，以致誤送愛女一命，多年心血，盡付束流，……」我聽了一時想不出適當的話來安慰二位老人家，而心中默念着舅父的話，無非只悟到了一半，其實主要病根是不善攝生啊！彷徨  李靜宜女士　　三月的天氣還是這般奇寒，每晚從學校裏回來，耳鼻總被夜風吹得紅腫，手尖凍痛，而且連眼睛都睜不開。這樣的辛勞究是爲了什麼？是吾値得？　　想到畢業後的一切，和目下社會上失業羣的廣大，不禁胆寒！焦急之餘，常想停學。但，我之所以繼續求學是吾單純的爲了要解决衣食住問題？抑另有求智的目的或較高的希望？　　爲了要達到我的目的和完成我的希望，我仍續學於S夜校。　　夜校的生活是別具風味的，初嘗試時因新奇而覺有趣，日久了便咸到有些不價和壓傷、每夜回來，坐着洋車，有時穿過幾條黑暗的小弄，有時拉過華燈齊放的南京路·但，無論是光明的大街或是黑暗的小路，這夜的街市所給我的感想只是一種難以形容的悲哀。看呀！滿眼都是死灰色，那人工的點綴更反映出夜的可怖，這和那面無人色而滿塗着脂粉的妓女，相映之下，是一般的可憐。　　大約是天氣的關係罷，近來總是懶洋洋的，無論做什麼都提不起精神來。睡着無聊，坐着又嫌太累。放着滿架的書沒心看，懷着大志却無奮鬬的勇氣。終日的只是戀往思來，明知與現實無益，却仍苦思不休。這矛盾的心理啊，實是我愁煩的來源！　　家庭的複雜，意見的衝突，形成了沈悶的空氣，造成了悲哀的環境。閒守在家裹，眞够無聊，而且我很知道，欲求自由，須先謀經濟獨立，因此我决意出來做事了。雖然我所做的事尚未能達到經濟獨立的地步，但精神上却已得到了不少的安慰，至少不像以前那般寂寞得怕人了。　　壓迫和需要緊跟着日月在增加，人們的虛僞和自私驚退了我的童眞。我不再如前一般的天眞！我憤怒！我感覺到，素性忠直而且固執的我是不適合於這萬惡的社會！　　當我發覺，我的四周，不論是至親或密友，都是一般的勢利，卑賤，眞把入世未深的我駭得遍體麻木。我覺得空虛！我對於一切都灰心！但，「希望」仍在百般的引誘我。我雖跛着脚，却仍喘着氣兒在奔馳。唉！走不盡的生命之途啊！何處是行旅者的家園？哲學講座物極則反  懷　　「物極則反」這句話在中國的社會上是很流行的。不但在中國的文戲典籍中隨處都可以找得到，並且就是稍爲認識幾個字的人也都常常說這句話，這就證明這句話是中國人的重要哲學思想之一，是中國人的宇宙觀之一。　　話雖如此說，但因爲社會是分了等級的，是個人主義的社會，所以由各種社會層和個人的利害的不同，對於這種宇宙觀也就依於不同的立塲而有不同的觀戚。從社會的上層的人看來，他們至多只肯承認在自然界有「物極則反」這種法則存在，在社會界是不承認有這種法則的。至於每個個人，他們或則只是用這種法則去論斷和推測別人的生活過程，而不能用這法則來推斷自己的一切，或則只希望自己在某些方面受這法則的支配，而某些可以不受這法則的支配，他們是不知這法則是普遍於自然和社會乃至每個個人的經歷過程的。比如在一切社會的上層的人，他們不但希望他們的一切利益能够無止境和盡期的永遠持續下去，不能「極」更不能「反」，而且也相信他們的命運是不會有「極」又有「反」的。所以歷代的帝王都以子孫帝王萬世之業作了他們的中心思想；以前的各民族的封建貴族也都認爲他們的地位是萬世不變的，甚至以此發生宇宙萬物都是一被創造成那樣的種屬就永久不變的。在近代的市民社會層也是一樣。至於在這個人主義的社會裏的每一個人，他們也都只能關心於自己個人的命運和利益，因此他在觀察別人的生活經歷時，很能客觀地反映「物極則反」的現實法則，可是一到他自身的問題來，他就一方面相信這個法則，而一方面又拒絕這個法則了。因爲他對於自己所處的有利的順境，老是希望無止境地順利地持續下去，不要有「極」又有「反」，能發財就永遠發財下去，能做官則不斷地高昇他的祿位。但是，對於他遭遇的任何逆境呢？那就只有希望它快點達到「極」頂，快點轉變爲「反」的過程。在有等級的社會裏，最相信「物極則反」的法則的人怕要算勸勞者了，因爲在他們的現實生活中只有不幸的威迫，就沒有絲毫有利事情可讓他們留戀，於是變與動纔是他們的希望。他們是隨時都在希望他們的窮困痛苦已達到了至「極」的終點，能在「極」的當中產生出一個「反」來。　　從這樣看來，「物極則反」的宇宙觀在有等級的社會裏是不成爲整個人類之統一的宇宙觀的，這是由於這樣的社會是以階層的和個人的利害爲中心，所以人人都以有利於自己的楷　和個入的主　觀點去推斷現實，面不把它當作　客，觀的自然的和社會的法則。從然是最窮困最痛苦的一個階層，它要算相信這法則最堅决的一個社會層，但仍是以它的主觀的利益爲出發點而認識這一法則的。不過因爲它在現實生活中巳經沒有私的利益存在，因而其思想愈能適合於客觀的法則，由主觀的理想變成了客觀法則而已。　　「物極則反」這種法則，不管它怎樣因爲社會的分化而不能成爲人類的一致的宇宙觀，但這法則始終是客觀的自然興社會的一般法則。這法則是適合於新的辯證論的哲學的觀點的，這裏我們得給它一個正確的說明。　　「物極則反」的思想，首先它就承認了萬有不是一下子就能至於「極」，「物」要至於「極」，其中是包含得有逐漸發展演進而至於「極」的意義存在的。又「物」一經發展和演進而至於「極」，則會出現一個「反」，這「反」因此也是從發展演進中產生出來的。因爲這樣，所以「物極則反」的宇宙觀首先就承認了發展的動的觀點，沒有變動「物」就不會至於「極」，也不會生出「反」來。而且由未至於「極」而至於「極」，再由「極」而至於「反」，這是一個連續地决第發展過程，所以這種思想還是有發展的歷史過程的觀點的。　　其决是「物極則反」之所謂要達到「極」才能反，這正合於由量變質的觀點·固爲所謂「物」至於「極」是可以把這「極」的意義當作由量的逐漸增加而達到量的飽和點看的。然而「物」之「反」的出現則要經過「極」的過程，卽要達到「極」才能「反」，這就是說變化耍達到一定的量才能有質變產生。不但如此，「物極則反」是說「物」一達到「極」就有「反」出現，這「反」不再是原來的質而是一個飛躍，是一個變了質的突轉，這正是說在由「極」到「反」時是經過了一個突變的過程的。　　復次，所謂「物極則反」，乃是明白一地說由原來的「物」發展變化，漸漸生起一「反」的因素，由變化達於極頂，就公開一地成爲和自己原來的「物」相反的束西。這正是在說「物」不是永久停留在與自己同一的階段，它是向着反對自己的反對物方面走，逐漸從自己的本身出發走向吾定自己的道路，而至於吾定自己的。「物」旣然在自身中生長着反對自己和吾定自己的因素，也由「極」而正式轉變爲「反」的東西來吾定自己，那麼凡「物」都是常時自己和自己在對立，常時都是以新的姿容和舊的姿容相對立相矛盾，常時都是自己而又不是自己。這就正合於凡「物」都是在矛盾的對立中統一地存在着，在吾定自己的過程中存在着，這完全是依於矛盾律去認識世界的，而不是依於同一律在認識世界。假使你還要觀察「物極則反」這種思想的究竟時，那你還可以發現其中的發展的必然性，因爲牠是說着「物」必有「極」的，更是說着一「極」則「反」的。「物」必有「極」，一「極」則「反」，這都是物之自發的必然性。　　總之，「物極則反」的中國的舊哲學思想，它是不自覺地偶然地反映了客觀世界存在着的辯證法的發展過程的。的確，宇宙萬「物」沒有永久存在而不達到一個「極」點的，達到了「極」點又沒有不消滅自己，產生出反乎自己的舊的存在形態而成爲一個新的形態的存在物的。「物極則反」正是宇宙發展的必然法則，任你用怎樣大的人力，是不能改變這一自然和社會的客觀法則的。播音節目特別節目　　藝雷劇社　　中華（一一四〇）上午九時至十時　　大地行軍曲（　網）永別弟弟（陶珍）畢業歌（全體）漁光曲（飾　）　秋（沈　）　陽壓（　　京劇合串　　航業（一一八〇）下午二時至十二時　　天官賜福（王叔英）百壽全圖（吳老甫）　龍戲鳳（劉艷芳小姐）（張福奎）陳橋登基（張桂　）（彭國環）過江赴宴（包光宇）（王培元）（縫菊友）（王叔榮）鴻鸞天禧（伯英女士）立志投軍（洪金雲小姐）（洪金玉小姐）仁貴回　（濟陽居士）（陶梅耀女士）寳建紅燈（王季周）（王幼琴小姐）行善得子（張佩珍）三堂會審（俞仁安）（陳梅殷女士）（劉菊禪）全本鼎盛春秋（包光宇）（張哲生）（陳良玉）（王得天）（陳景塘）（范叔年）盜馬拜山（汪其俊）（袁森齊）（張渭鳴）大登寳殿（程君謀）（沈元豫小姐）（包小蝶）老將得勝（王凖臣）月下追韓信（王雪慶）（惲慧羣）（朱聯馥）（惲子　）（范叔年）盜宗卷（李白水）王振銘）　　嚇哧哧歌詠團　　華與（一二六〇）下午七時至七時三刻　　吹泡泡（余芸）和平歌（王瑛）特別快車（李彪）永別弟弟（林韻）蘇三不哭（苗珊）母親（孔芬）賣油條（余芸）　　上海市廣播無綫電台每日節目　　上午　一一·四五　愛國音樂　　一二·○○　報時　氣象　西樂　　下午　一·○○　休息　　四·一五　歌唱　　四·三○　口琴（中華口琴隊）　　五·○○　歌唱　　五·二○　平劇　　六·○○　一週内重要新聞　　六·一五　大鼓　　六·三○　新聞　西樂　　七·○○　報時氣象　平劇　　七·五○　預報明日節目　　七·五五　西樂　　八·○○　停止　　餘音　　今日上午九時至十時靑白劇社假座市音播送話劇「胡天民。」十二時三刻至一時半雷雷劇社假座李樹德播送「黃浦江畔。」　　中西電臺下午一時三刻至二時半播送呂蕙社開篇啼笑因緣，贈塔，託三章。電影消息　　梁賽珠小姐又打電話到編輯室來，她預吿我她要送一封信給我，這封信是由專差在二十分鐘之後送來的，同時南京的哈特也寄來一封信，因爲篇幅關係，準明日一併發刊。　　「萬古流芳」主角保羅茂尼　　飾演兩個時期的巴士德　　大光明下星期三晚場獻映今日引翔鄉賽馬預測　　有得勝希望者：　　冒寗軋羅來　Morning　Glory　　奇異　G.E　　扒來羅　Bolero　　常歴阿康脫　Joint　Account　　好男蒙軋夫脫　Honeymoon　gift　　生蜜特靈　St.Middling　　和平　Ho-Ping　　牡丹花　Mou　Tan　Hua　　有力克愛克山倫　Eureka　Ercelient　　矮美雪軋納而　Ar

<p>Tianjin - Major General Song Shi Xiaoliang arrived in Tianjin at 6:00 AM on the 28th via the Shenyang-Beiping train. He was accompanied by a senior aide. At 8:00 AM, he visited Commander Tada and Chief of Staff Nagami at the Zhang Garden residence. Regarding anti-communism in North China and Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, he held earnest discussions for two hours based on instructions received from the military headquarters. In the afternoon, he attended a banquet hosted by Tada. Song Zheyuan dispatched Chen Zhongfu to Tianjin to meet with him. Song Shi decided to go to Beiping on the 1st and form a special agency of the North China Military Headquarters stationed in Beiping with Major Hamada. It is expected that Hebei-Chahar diplomacy will continue in early April. Reliable sources indicate that the Japanese military headquarters has decided to prioritize anti-communism over diplomacy in North China. The Hebei East issue will be discussed after the situation stabilizes. Studying its cancellation at this moment is considered too early. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Beiping - Song Shi Xiaoliang, attached to the Tianjin Garrison Army, arrived in Tianjin today. He met with Tada and decided to come to Beiping with Hamada on April 1st to start work. Kuwahara, the head of the Japanese special agency in Tongxian, will soon be transferred. The Japanese side has appointed Ueno to succeed him and preside over everything. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Song Shi Xiaoliang changed his itinerary. He arrived in Tianjin from Shenyang by train early on the morning of the 28th. He met with Tada Nagami and others for discussions. Song Shi plans to stay in Tianjin briefly and then visit local authorities in China and begin organizing special agency affairs.

Song Shi said, "I will stay in Tianjin for four or five days and plan to meet with Chairman Song Zheyuan before leaving Tianjin. As for Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, since I have not discussed the details with all parties, many situations are unclear and it is difficult to announce the direction of progress for the time being."

The anti-communist arrangements in Hebei and Chahar are well-prepared. Song is very concerned about this, so there is confidence in anti-communism. Recently, there have been many rumors about North China. It is said that since the communist bandits invaded Shanxi, they have been quite rampant. The Japanese side is paying close attention, which has caused diplomatic tensions at one point. After the authorities explained the Hebei-Chahar anti-communist plan to the Japanese side, the Japanese side has understood. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

During his tenure as Mayor of Tianjin, Cheng was dealing with the tense North China diplomacy and the autonomy movement.

<h3 id="e15">Japan Implements News Control <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Since the formation of the Hirota Cabinet, there has been discussion about adding a propaganda department to the government. Recently, Motoki has repeatedly advocated for the establishment of an information committee directly under the cabinet to control the news and unify propaganda. The cabinet members have expressed their agreement and will submit a special resolution as soon as the official system is determined. According to Motoki's intention, in this extraordinary situation, the government needs to supervise news and information. The previous cabinet had filed a case to unify the Army Ministry's News Section, the Navy Ministry's Military Popularization Department, and the Foreign Ministry's Information Department to establish a special agency. This proposal is based on that case. The government's establishment of a special propaganda department directly under the cabinet was first done by the German Hitler government. Although the Soviet Union has many information and propaganda agencies, it has not set up a special department. Japan is imitating Germany, and its motives are very obvious. The actions of these two Eastern and Western ambitious countries are preparing for a second world war. News control and public opinion manufacturing are the most important parts of the total mobilization plan.</p>
<p>Although the Second World War has not officially broken out, hundreds of millions of people around the world have already tasted the various pains of war. Food control and transportation control have a relatively light impact. What makes people feel the most pain is the control of thought, the concealment of sight and hearing, and the loss of freedom of speech. Looking at various countries, although the degree of exploitation of freedom of speech varies, the trends are very consistent. What the German people hear is the German National Socialist Workers' Party's non-stop radio broadcasts. What they see are the German National Socialist Workers' Party's newspapers and propaganda. Personality is suppressed, and there is no opportunity for reason to be active. If you are born under shackles and trapped in a prison, you will gradually become accustomed to it, and right and wrong are only what Goebbels says. The situations in Italy and the Soviet Union are also the same. The people in the country cannot know about their own country and the world without the colored glasses made by the government. People outside the country cannot know about the country without the special megaphone made by the country. News is the spiritual food of mankind. Since food contains anesthetics, it has the same effect as what the maker of the anesthetics wants. Humans are rational animals. This definition is no longer suitable for today's world.</p>
<p>The Japanese people have always lacked the habit of civil governance and the training of independent thought, and the effect of close feelings is strong and subjective prejudices are deep. Now the government is using these weaknesses to agitate them, making the people intoxicated in an atmosphere of militarism and national chauvinism. Once the hatred of foreign races and the contempt for other countries lose their constraints, they will inevitably be like the overflowing Yellow River, rushing thousands of miles and using the fate of the entire country and the entire nation as a gamble. There is no shortage of enlightened people in that country, but they are subdued by power and threatened by the feelings of the masses and dare not say what they want to say and do what they should do. However, before the government's information and propaganda agencies are unified, there is still a bit of freedom. If a unified information agency is established, it will be like a large net or a huge gate, with no fish escaping the net and no free water.</p>
<p>The function of news is to give mankind light and make the affairs of the world visible to all, to provide the basis for thought with the facts seen, and to use the reason of the human heart to judge, and then opinions are formed. Therefore, correct public opinion comes from correct news, and the correctness of news comes from the fact that the source of news is not restricted and the content of news is not colored. Today, countries such as Germany and Japan are working hard to restrict the source of news and color the content of news, using the agency that broadcasts light as a tool for creating darkness. This is a great misfortune for mankind and a major crisis for civilization.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Wang Jingwei Assassination Attempt Case: Masterminded by Chen Mingshu and Others – Prosecutor Submits Indictment – Approximately 40,000 Words in Two Parts <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The assassination attempt case of the former President of the Executive Yuan is scheduled for public hearing at 1:00 PM on the 30th. The indictment submitted to the court by Luo Renji, Prosecutor of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, is approximately 40,000 words long. The first part, detailing the facts of the crime, generally states that the six defendants – Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi – had Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen as the masterminds behind the assassination. After the failure of the Fujian Incident led by Chen and Li, they were unwilling to submit and plotted to rise again. They believed that unless they disrupted the central and local security, plunging them into chaos, it would be difficult to proceed. Therefore, they planned to harm important central figures. Wang Yaqiao (currently at large), who had participated in the Fujian Incident, was willing to be used. Initially, the plan was to harm Chairman Chiang alone. Chen and Li provided financial support, and Wang oversaw the operation. Wang then summoned his followers Hua Kezhi (alias Hu Shiqing, currently at large) and Sun Fengming (the deceased assassin), instructing them to organize an agency to provide cover. Defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang both had leftist leanings and had joined the Communist Party's social union. Liu Shurong was an old acquaintance of Zhang. After receiving instructions from Wang, Hua first discussed the plan with Zhang, who agreed. Zhang then discussed it with He, who also agreed. Hua and Zhang then recruited Liu Shurong to Beijing to establish the Chenguang News Agency. Hua was responsible for finances, contacting Chen and Li in Hong Kong, and training Sun Fengming, while Zhang was responsible for everything within the agency. He and Liu were responsible for news gathering and external relations. This was in September of the 23rd year (of the Republic). In October of the same year, articles were issued as a disguise, waiting for an opportunity to act. The six-shot revolver used by Sun for the assassination was obtained by Hua from Wang Yaqiao and brought to Beijing, hidden in the home of the defendant Lu Qingqi, who was aware of the plan. In February of the same year, the Central Government held the Fifth Plenary Session, and Chairman Chiang attended a photo opportunity. This was seen as an opportunity. The day before, Hua encouraged Sun. When the time came, Zhang and He escorted Sun. However, Sun became too nervous from being so close to Chairman Chiang and failed to act. In the fall of the 24th year, Wang resigned as President of the Executive Yuan, and Chiang arrived in Beijing from Wuhan. This was again seen as an opportunity. He escorted Sun again, but the assassination was aborted because Chiang was not present. After the first failed attempt, Chen's associates became dissatisfied with Hua and cut off funding. The agency's finances were strained. Zhang then recruited Xiang Zhonglin to Beijing to solicit subsidies from various parties, but to no avail. Li Jishen then sent 1,000 yuan from Shanghai, which allowed them to continue. At this time, the Central Government had decided to hold the Sixth Plenary Session on November 1st. Hua and others saw this as the last opportunity. Around October 20th, Hua and Sun arrived in Beijing from Shanghai and discussed with Zhang and He, deciding to act during the photo opportunity, targeting Chiang first, then Wang. If both attempts failed, they would create a major disturbance. On the evening of October 28th, Hua initiated a discussion meeting, in which Zhang, He, Liu, Sun, Xiang, and Li participated. Except for Liu, all provided guidance and encouragement to Sun. The day before the meeting, He requested Xiang to ask his unwitting old friend Xu Renru, secretary of the Central Party History Committee, to intercede because the Central Government had not approved the issuance of press passes. He also asked unwitting central officers Wu Huang and Zhou Xiling to help. On the morning of November 1st, He obtained the press pass and handed it to Sun, who entered the venue and hid among the crowd near the cameras. When Wang was in the front row, Sun fired three shots in succession after the photo was taken, but fortunately, they were not fatal. Sun was then held by Zhang Ji, and was shot by the guards. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, Sun died from his injuries. Defendants Zhang, He, Liu, Li, Xiang, and Lu were subsequently apprehended in Shanghai, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places. The Capital Police Department, along with Guo Zhimou, Guo Fei, Zhou Xiling, Wu Huang, and Li Zhongying, who were suspected of involvement, were handed over to the Gendarmerie Headquarters and ordered to be processed by the court.</p>
<p>The second part outlines the evidence and the laws violated, stating that in addition to Sun being the shooter in the case and admitting it in writing, defendants Zhang and He, after being captured, stated to the Gendarmerie Headquarters that they had leftist leanings, had joined the Communist Party, and how they had listened to Hua Kezhi, who was instructed by Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Wang Yaqiao. They organized the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating important central figures, how they allocated tasks, arranged the implementation, and how Chen, Li, and Wang took the initiative, provided financial support, and oversaw the operation. During the investigation, Zhang and He repeatedly confessed to the same facts. According to Zhang and He, Chen and Li's purpose was to compete for political territory, believing that the most important person in the Central Government was Chiang. If he could be assassinated, local security would be disrupted, and the political situation would fall into chaos, which Chen and Li could use to recover, etc. The evidence against the defendants is clear, with no doubt. Liu Shurong was aware of the situation, gathered news at the Chenguang News Agency, and participated in the conspiracy, repeatedly confessing. Li Huaicheng and Xiang Zhonglin participated in the conspiracy and encouraged Sun. Xiang even solicited subsidies and asked for the press pass. When questioned, the defendants all stated that this was true. Lu Qingqi admitted that he had stored the pistol for Zhang for several days in September of the 24th year, but argued that it was purely out of friendship and that he was unaware of the plan. When questioned, Zhang, He, and Liu all stated that the defendant was indeed aware of the plan and participated. Zhang also stated that the defendant knew about the content of the news agency not long after it was established. After the second plan failed, the defendant was the one who sent the telegram to notify the news, so how could he try to shirk responsibility? In summary, the ultimate goal of this case was to disrupt the central and local security, creating an opportunity for Chen, Li, and others to seize the country and undermine unification again. They are guilty of violating Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, which aims at harming the Republic of China. Their method of attempted murder also violates Article 271, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. However, this crime is lighter than the crime of endangering the Republic of China, so according to Article 55 of the Criminal Law, they should be punished according to the heavier crime. Although Liu, Li, Xiang, and Lu's involvement seems lighter than Zhang and He's, in terms of the overall conspiracy of this case, they should also be considered joint offenders and sentenced according to the aforementioned laws. Zhang had joined the Communist Party's social union and served as a district committee member. He had joined the Communist Party's social union and the Workers' Education Union and should also be held responsible under Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. Except for Guo Zhimou, Guo Fei, Zhou Xiling, Wu Huang, and Li Zhongying, whose criminal suspicion is insufficient and will be given a separate non-prosecution disposition, the public prosecution is hereby initiated in accordance with Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

<h3 id="e45">Hitler's Speech on Peace: International Discrimination Will Not Cease in Silence; Foreign Policy to Be Judged by the People <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Aisende Führer Hitler delivered his ninth decisive election speech at the Krupp locomotive factory here this afternoon, saying that what Germany needs is peace and tranquility, work, bread, and a decent life. Herr Hitler wants the people of the country to trust his foreign policy and allow him to vote in favor of the advance into the Rhineland. He is giving speeches everywhere. No less than one million people heard his speech today, but because his words are broadcast all over the world, there are hundreds of millions more outside Germany who have heard his words. Before Mr. Hitler spoke, the whole country was silent for one minute. Mr. Hitler said that the reason why he chose Aisende as the location for his speech was because Germany could be a symbol of the working class, and there was no better place than this, because the audience was not only arms manufacturers, but also peacemakers. Mr. Hitler recounted the beneficial changes that the National Socialist government had made in Germany's economic life in the past three years, saying that predecessors had talked about it for fifteen years, but after fifteen years, someone had to do it. He then rose up and did it. Mr. Hitler stated the importance of national unity in order to seek the political, economic, and human rights that it should have. We have discovered a new national conscience. If there is no internal peace, Germany will perish. There is no so-called victor, nor is there a so-called loser. Peace can only be established on the basis of equal rights and equal honor. Germany does not want to provoke war with other countries. Germany only sees the possibility of large-scale understanding to seek the welfare of all parties. Germany hopes that foreign politicians will respect Germany's internal affairs. Europe is like a family. If a member of this family continues to infringe upon France, Belgium, or any other country, it is an unjust act. In the past eighteen years, treaties have been repeatedly broken. Others should not be garrulous about the sanctity of treaties. Germany's words are just as respectable as those of other countries. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>German City of Aisende Führer Hitler gave his ninth decisive election speech at the Krupp armaments factory here at 4 p.m. today. First, the Führer arrived here by train from Berlin at 1:25 p.m., and then changed to a car and drove slowly into the city. At that time, the bells of the church and the city hall rang in unison, and workers and the public cheered along the road, throwing flowers into the car that the Führer was riding in. When he arrived at the Krupp factory, the sound of the machines in the factory was grating as they were working. The Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, ordered all the machines to be temporarily stopped. A moment later, the whistles of factories in the city and other factories sounded in unison, announcing that the Führer's speech would begin immediately. At the same time, traffic in all parts of the country also stopped for one minute. The Führer spoke from a railway locomotive to 120,000 workers, saying, "The armaments made by the Krupp armaments factory are for the purpose of peace. Some people outside are speculating that the German working class intends to betray me. I have chosen this place to speak to the German workers, and the previous saying has been refuted without being attacked. Therefore, this grand meeting has a profound meaning. Because of the establishment of our national socialist system, the fallacy of Marx's class struggle can be eradicated. I myself belong to the people's class. I am not interested in armaments. Looking around the world, there is probably only one person among the politicians who does not have a penny of savings in the bank or a share of stock in the company. What I want, and fear, is that Germany can enjoy peace internally and externally. The Führer then described the international situation, saying, "I was originally prepared to tolerate the demilitarized zone system of the Rhineland, only on the condition that other countries could also adhere to the spirit and letter of the Locarno Pact. It is not my intention to have endless disputes with other countries, but if other countries treat Germany with discrimination, then I will not cease in silence. We do not interfere in the affairs of other countries. We often do what we want in our own country, and we do not want others to interfere. I have reached out to other countries in the hope of translation, but I have been lightly rejected. I have built up a restriction on armaments, but it has not been tolerated by other countries, and instead they have concluded military alliances. Under these circumstances, I have no choice but to obtain our country's military sovereignty. Whether my actions are right or wrong, only the people of the country can judge them, and not all the associations in the international community. If any treaty is to be established, if the countries of the treaty can be on an equal footing, then this treaty will have inviolable sanctity. Since the Treaty of Versailles does not meet the conditions of equality, why should people use the word 'inviolable sanctity' to me?" Hitler concluded by saying that domestic undertakings are all he has, and he is already very busy, so why would he have time to disturb other countries? "Once I have put forward novel proposals, whether politicians of other countries will reject them or ask me to make symbolic representations, they should first consult the opinions of the people of their respective countries before they can make a decision," and so on.

<h3 id="e46">German Election Campaign <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Various Propaganda Methods</p>
<p>Berlin The date of the re-election of the House of Representatives is approaching. In the past two weeks, the tension of the election campaign and the enthusiasm of propaganda have spread throughout the country. The methods used are various and unprecedented. National Socialist leaders travel around the country to major cities and towns to give speeches. Every night, all radio stations broadcast these speeches. Even the Führer Hitler does not hesitate to travel far and wide to various places. Since starting to give election speeches in Karlsruhe, he has given his ninth decisive speech to workers at the Krupp armaments factory in Aisende today. Tomorrow, he will give his tenth decisive speech in Cologne on the banks of the Rhine River, which will be the last decisive speech of this election campaign. Looking at the nine decisive speeches, the one given at the German Building here a few days ago can be said to be grand. On that day, 500,000 people stood attentively in front of the building, as if they were using their bodies as walls to build a corridor that stretched for twelve kilometers. It would not be an exaggeration to call it the "Victory Corridor." In advance, the government ordered all stores and residents along the street in the city to hang flags and decorations on the windows facing the street. The homes of Jewish people were not exempted either. In the city of Hiltshan in the province of Westphalia, most of the residents are Catholics. All the women in the city recently received orders to hang hearts cut out of red paper on the windows along the street for three days on the 27th, 28th, and 29th, and to light candles at night as proof of the Catholics' loyalty to Führer Hitler. In addition, huge posters, surrounded by flowers and national flags, with portraits of Führer Hitler painted on them, can be seen everywhere. All the taxis in Berlin have the same advertisement posted on them, with the words "Please vote for the Führer on March 29th." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The re-election period of the German House of Representatives is near. The German Ambassador to this place, Mao Qi, embassy personnel, and all 200 German expatriates recently took a special train to Königsberg, the capital of the East Prussia province of Germany, where they voted in the election. A German steamship also sailed into the port of the Free City of Danzig to allow the German people in the city to board the ship and hold a vote. All people of German nationality must not evade, and all travel expenses will be paid by the government. The newspapers of various minority organizations in Germany in the Free City have also printed a kind of symbol that will be distributed to the voters on the voting day. Anyone who has voted will get a piece of paper, and those who do not have this symbol can be known at a glance that they have not voted. It is easy to identify, and it is impossible to evade even if they want to. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Alexandria More than ten German expatriates in various parts of Egypt will board the ship General Situ Ben tomorrow to cast their election votes. The ship has now been temporarily converted into a floating polling station and will be stationed outside the three-mile boundary for the German expatriates to vote. The results will be reported to Germany by radio. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>German Chief Representative Returns Home to Report</p>
<p>Negotiations on Diplomacy in the Past Eighteen Months</p>
<p>British Government to Publish White Paper</p>
<p>London After Ribbentrop, the German representative to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, returned home yesterday to report, the newspapers here discussed the situation again, all believing that there was probably not much hope for the German government to show a spirit of compromise. This can be inferred from the election speeches made by the authorities of that country and the last conversation between Ribbentrop and Foreign Minister Eden. Most newspapers do not advocate "skillful evasion" of the current difficult situation, but say that the German government must make a compromise. The future negotiations can only be successful if this is determined. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London Ribbentrop, the German representative to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, returned to his country by plane at 4 p.m. today with his delegation. It is said that he will stop in Aisende to hold consultations with Führer Hitler. As far as most people know, Ribbentrop asked Foreign Minister Eden when they met this morning: In the Foreign Minister's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, there was a section that reaffirmed the obligations that the United Kingdom should bear as recorded in the Locarno Pact. Is that correct? Does the United Kingdom still consider that it bears the responsibility of guaranteeing the German border? Eden replied that the Locarno Pact had been abolished by Germany, so in the future, the United Kingdom would only bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the borders of France and Belgium. In addition, according to reliable sources obtained by our reporter, Ribbentrop also declared to Foreign Minister Eden that if the United Kingdom immediately implements the agreement concluded by the general staff of the countries in the valley, it would be tantamount to giving the French and Belgian governments a prior guarantee of the results of future negotiations. Then what is the benefit of Germany even if it puts forward a counter-proposal? People generally say that Ribbentrop's words are intended to intimidate the United Kingdom, but the Cabinet was not moved by it. It has already announced the general staff agreement, which will soon be implemented. Political figures are not very optimistic about the talks between Britain and Germany this morning, believing that Germany may not even put forward any counter-proposal. However, the final decision on this matter rests with Führer Hitler. It is hoped that after Britain firmly states its position, it may make Germany's attitude tend to be eased. The Foreign Office expects that Ribbentrop will not return to the United Kingdom, so the German reply may be handed over to Foreign Minister Eden by the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Herr. However, in any case, regarding the mutual assistance measures proposed by the general staff of the countries concerned, the British government will send them to France and Belgium after the Cabinet meeting next Monday before the German reply is delivered. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London The British government has been negotiating with the German government continuously since the past eighteen months, and there have been more than sixty documents exchanged between the two sides. The government is now planning to print these documents into a white paper, which is currently being edited. It is expected that it can be distributed to the members of Congress at the end of next week so that they can get one copy each. People generally believe that the government has made painstaking efforts, hoping to reach an understanding with Germany and establish a collective security system in a tacit way. However, all the efforts have been in vain and nothing has been achieved. After these documents are published, the members of Congress will be able to understand the past situation at a glance.

<p>Location Not Yet Determined: Paris or Beijing</p>
<p>Paris Today someone proposed that the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy, should meet in Paris as soon as possible after receiving Germany's answer to the four countries' memorandum. The date has been set for April 3, but so far it cannot be said to be certain. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris The "Paris Echo" recently revealed a message, saying that once Germany's concrete reply and counter-proposal are submitted on March 31, the four countries of Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy will immediately convene a new meeting to discuss the matter. The date should be April 3. As for the location of the meeting, the French government is in favor of holding it in Paris, but it is speculated that the British government's position seems not to agree with this idea, and requires it to be held in Brussels, Beijing, which needs to be decided depending on the development of the non-state. (Guomin dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London Responsible persons here recently declared that there is no definite plan at this time for the saying that the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact (except Germany) should hold another meeting in Brussels, Beijing. A concrete decision can only be made after the German government submits a counter-proposal to the Locarno Accord. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris The famous journalist Saint-Proust recently published a commentary in the newspaper, saying, "The four signatory countries of the Locarno Pact (i.e., Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy) should hold a meeting after Germany proposes a new proposal. It is said that the British Foreign Minister Eden initiated it and made a proposal to the French Foreign Minister Flandin. Flandin immediately replied that he would do so. The purpose of convening this meeting is not to discuss the draft agreement that has already been decided at the first London meeting, but to study under what conditions this draft agreement must be to adapt to the recent situation. Flandin believes that the four signatory countries of the Locarno Pact must maintain close contact and jointly agree on future attitudes. In other words, if the German proposal is unacceptable, it should be jointly and clearly rejected. If there are acceptable points, they should also be jointly decided. As for the location of the meeting, it can be in Paris or Beijing, but Beijing is more approximate, and the date will be at the end of next week or two weeks later." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Paris Foreign Minister Flandin, after meeting with Czech Minister Osusky and Yugoslav Minister Buric yesterday, according to the Morning Post, the ministers of the two countries asked the Foreign Minister whether France's obligations to those countries remained the same.

Germany then used the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact as an excuse to abolish it. It is known that the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact has nothing to do with Belgium. After Germany abolished it, the threat to Belgium was greater than that to France. As for the counter-proposal that Germany can put forward to the Locarno Accord, unless that country provides guarantees to prevent the action of abolishing it from being repeated in the future, it cannot be seriously discussed. In addition, regarding the request for equal rights, allowing it to be a request for colonies, is it willing to be equal to the existing rights of Britain and France, and should also ask the German government to clearly explain it.

<p>Paris A few days ago, several German planes, said to be military planes, flew over the fortress area near the city of Strasbourg in the northeast, quite close to the ground. The local government immediately copied down the plane numbers and reported them to the government, making representations to the German embassy. The German government investigated and proved that the planes were actually civilian planes. German Aviation Minister General Goering had previously ordered all planes in the country, whether civilian or military, to be banned from flying over borders, except for those flying on scheduled airline routes. The pilots of the above-mentioned planes did not comply with this order and have been severely punished by General Goering. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Dutch Capital News reports say that the government has recently received a telegram from Wenluo, on the banks of the Muus River on the southeastern border, stating that according to a report by a lieutenant stationed there, a German military monoplane flew twice over the garrison barracks there yesterday. The plane flew very low, apparently taking photographs of the barracks. The lieutenant has reported to the officer in charge. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Changchun Former Commander Nan and new Kwantung Army Commander Ueda transferred affairs in the commander's office of the army headquarters at 2:30 p.m. today. The old and new commanders had dinner together that night and talked cordially. At that time, Commander Nan stated his views as follows:</p>
<p>When I took office, I established five fundamental guidelines and worked hard to realize them:  To establish the prestige of the Kwantung Army,  To harmonize the five ethnic groups,  To promote economic cooperation between Japan and "Manchukuo,"  To maintain public order,  To maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries. One and two have been thoroughly implemented, and three and four are also being gradually realized. However, with regard to five, friendly relations with neighboring countries, because the Soviet Union often expands its power externally, links with Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, and causes the共匪 of Jin Province to operate, the Kwantung Army cannot but pay close attention.

<p>Incident Expected Not to Escalate</p>
<p>Moscow. Ambassador Ota visited the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister on the 27th to lodge a serious protest regarding the Changlingzi incident involving a clash between Japanese and Russian soldiers. The Ambassador pointed out the fact that Soviet Russian border guards had crossed the border into "Manchukuo" and stated that the responsibility lay with the Russian side. However, the Russian Foreign Minister did not acknowledge this, instead accusing the Japanese army of intruding into Russian territory. After an hour of discussion, the two sides' positions remained irreconcilable, and the meeting ended without a resolution. (Telegraph from Dōmei News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Observers here now believe that the March 26th conflict between Japanese-Manchu and Russian soldiers at Changlingzi on the eastern "Manchu" border can be resolved through diplomatic channels. Both sides suffered casualties and blamed each other. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Changchun stating that there is no apparent danger of renewed fighting. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to news received today from Seoul, the Korean Army has withdrawn its order to prepare troop trains to transport reinforcements to Changlingzi. Senior military officers, after receiving a report on the border conflict from the McCooke official, held a meeting and decided to rescind the previous order, as the matter is believed to be resolvable locally. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Changlingzi incident has calmed down and does not appear to be escalating. As the incident falls under the jurisdiction of the Korean Army, the headquarters has dispatched Staff Officer Ohno to investigate the truth. Therefore, negotiations will be conducted in the future by the Korean Army and Soviet Russian military authorities. At the same time, Ambassador Ota stationed in Russia will conduct negotiations with the Soviet Russian Foreign Ministry. (Telegraph from Dōmei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese soldiers injured in the Changlingzi incident were Lieutenant Yoshida, Second Lieutenant Fukushima, and Sergeant Major Ogura. First-Class Military Doctor Tamita and Private First Class Yoshida were captured by the Soviet Russian army. The Soviet Russian side suffered as many as twenty casualties.

<p>Moscow. Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev, acting on instructions from the Soviet government, protested to Hirota about the armed Japanese forces crossing the border and attacking Soviet border guards on March 26th. He demanded a thorough investigation of the actions of the local Japanese authorities, punishment of those responsible, and reserved the right to claim compensation for losses.</p>
<p>On March 27th, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ota met with Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov to protest the same incident. He claimed that the Japanese army had not crossed into Soviet territory but had been fired upon by the Soviet side without provocation within Manchurian territory, leading to the conflict.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov resolutely rejected the Japanese government's protest, deeming it completely unfounded and in stark contradiction to undeniable facts. He stated that the Japanese army had crossed the border at Boundary Marker No. 8, making it impossible to claim border ambiguity. The location of the conflict was within Soviet territory, 250 meters from the border. Furthermore, the bodies of two Japanese soldiers, along with numerous Japanese military equipment and ammunition, were discovered within Soviet territory, including 27 hand grenades, 85 rounds of ammunition, 2,600 shell casings, a tent, several reports, and a Japanese military helmet and a blood-stained Japanese military cap. At the same time, Stomonyakov confirmed the protest made by Yurenev to Hirota on March 26th.</p>
<p>During the meeting with Ota, Stomonyakov received a report that at 1:00 PM on March 27th, five armed cavalrymen invaded the Soviet Union from Manchuria at a point two kilometers southeast of the village of Slyatnyevshipsk, firing upon three Soviet border guards. He immediately protested to Ota.</p>
<p>As a result of the conflict, two or three of the five invaders were killed, and two retreated, leaving behind a light machine gun, a rifle, and two Mauser rifles. Stomonyakov urged Ambassador Ota to note that the Japanese government had already proposed revising the border and establishing border peace, yet within a few days, another incident of attacking the Soviet border had occurred. Stomonyakov believed that some Japanese officials in Manchuria were clearly dissatisfied with the prospect of improved Soviet-Japanese relations and were deliberately provoking border conflicts.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ambassador Ota responded to Stomonyakov's inquiry of March 16th, stating that the Japanese government believed that expanding the mandate of the border conflict mediation committee to the entire Soviet-Manchu border was unnecessary. It would be better to limit the committee's mandate to the area from Lake Khanka to the Korean border. Additionally, the Japanese government believed that it was inappropriate to conflate the issue of the Soviet-Qingcha border committee with the organization of the Manchu-Mongol joint committee. Ota also stated that discussions on the Manchu-Mongol border issue are currently underway between Manchu and Mongol representatives and that he hoped for a successful conclusion. Stomonyakov agreed to convey this response to the Soviet government. (Telegraph from TASS, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Importance and Implementation of Cooperative Movements (Part 2) - Dean of the Cooperative College of the Central Political School, Shou Miancheng <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of economic systems, while we certainly want to improve production efficiency and promote fair distribution, why must we adopt the economic system of cooperatives? Don't capitalist systems, communist systems, and many other socialist systems also claim to improve production efficiency and promote fair distribution? Regarding this point, there are five reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Centralization and Freedom: Centralization has its advantages, and freedom has its advantages, but both must have appropriate limitations, otherwise, they will lead to significant abuses. The cooperative system strikes a balance between the two, neither excessively centralized nor excessively laissez-faire, which is its strength.</p>
<p>2.  Public and Private Ownership: Communism and socialism advocate that all industries should be publicly owned in principle, while capitalism advocates that all industries should be privately owned in principle. In fact, both public and private ownership have their advantages. The cooperative system advocates a balance of public and private ownership. Many businesses should, of course, be privately operated in a cooperative manner, but there are also many businesses, such as postal services, telecommunications, railways, shipping, aviation, and large-scale basic industries, which are obviously best suited for public ownership. Moreover, since public enterprises also aim to benefit consumers as their ultimate goal, they can coexist without conflict with cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>3.  Private Property and Public Benefit: Cooperative property belongs to private individuals, but its purpose is for public benefit. This is its strength. Because under the capitalist system, both private property and private benefit are undesirable, while socialism's advocacy of completely eliminating private property seems unnecessary. We are not absolutely opposed to public ownership, but if we can achieve public goals through private ownership, isn't that better, except for the parts that must be publicly owned?</p>
<p>4.  Peace and Intensity: The spirit of the cooperative system is one of peaceful struggle. On the one hand, it uses peaceful methods, but on the other hand, it also strives to achieve revolutionary goals, such as eliminating the merchant class and distributing profits to members, all of which are revolutionary methods. However, it is not as violent as communism.</p>
<p>5.  Prudence and Risk: With the exception of a few cases, other economic systems mostly advocate for immediate and total transformation. The outcome of such transformation is still largely unknown, which is a risky approach. The cooperative system, on the other hand, can be gradually expanded and developed naturally. Its prudence is a major advantage. Therefore, from the perspective of economic systems, the cooperative system also occupies a very important position.</p>
<p>Thirdly, even from the perspective of China's special circumstances, the importance of cooperative enterprises is even more apparent. Can't rural bankruptcy be remedied by applying marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, utilization cooperatives, and purchasing cooperatives? Can't the decline of industry and commerce be remedied by applying consumer cooperatives and industrial cooperatives? Although some stores may be negatively affected by cooperative enterprises, efforts can be made to transfer capital to other uses. In addition, there is the problem of import surplus, which I believe can also be helped by consumer cooperatives. If national consumer cooperatives for domestic goods are established throughout the country, and more than half of the population joins consumer cooperatives as members, I believe that considerable results can be achieved.</p>
<p>(3) The Business Economics of Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>The business economics of cooperative enterprises must, of course, vary depending on the enterprise being operated. Generally speaking, there are ten principles, which are described in detail below:</p>
<p>1.  Centralized Management: This means uniting many small cooperative units to form cooperative federations, so that the scale can be reasonably large. Purchasing raw materials and marketing products can save costs, and waste utilization can be made easier.</p>
<p>2.  Relationship Analysis: This means clarifying all aspects related to a business. For example, when running a cotton marketing cooperative, it is necessary to see which aspects are related to its marketing. Transportation, seeds, packaging, yarn factories, finance, etc., are all closely related to cotton marketing and should be considered comprehensively.</p>
<p>3.  Substitute Use: Cooperative employees should be observed from all aspects. If there are shortcomings, efforts should be made to transfer or replace them. Cooperative machines or other equipment should also be examined to see if they are suitable for use. If they are not suitable, they should be replaced with something else.</p>
<p>4.  Proportional Harmony: All related factors should be harmonized proportionally. The ratio of the cooperative's equipment to its work should be maintained at a reasonable level. If there are too many people and too little work, efficiency will inevitably decrease. For example, if there is too much fixed capital and too little working capital, it will not be able to operate effectively. In economics, there are two very common laws: the law of diminishing costs and the law of diminishing returns. The reason why costs and returns diminish is precisely because the former is harmonized, while the latter loses its harmony.</p>
<p>5.  Simplification: This should be paid attention to in both production cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. If things are too complicated, confusion and waste are inevitable.</p>
<p>6.  Labor Reduction: Using machines to replace manual labor is one way to reduce labor, but work distribution and equipment methods are also related. Everything must be convenient and continuous. The relationship between utility and cost must also be considered.</p>
<p>7.  Address the Root Cause: All problems must be solved from the root. Improving seeds and improving technology are the most obvious examples.</p>
<p>8.  Control Psychology: For example, when running a cooperative, if you can't grasp the psychology of the members and can't make them interested in and believe in the cooperative, the cooperative cannot be run well.</p>
<p>9.  Shared Benefits: The salaries and wages of cooperative employees and workers must be commensurate with their actual contributions. Otherwise, fairness will be lost, and they will not be motivated to work hard.</p>
<p>10. Precise Calculation: All businesses have their budgets and final accounts. The analysis of the costs and revenues of individual products must be carried out carefully.</p>
<p>(4) The Past and Future Implementation of Cooperative Enterprises in Our Country.</p>
<p>The types, importance, and operating methods of cooperative enterprises have been briefly described above, but how to implement them effectively has become the most critical issue. The cooperative movement in China has a history of more than ten years. There are already more than ten thousand established cooperatives. However, our past work seems to have been too focused on quantitative development, only knowing how to establish cooperatives as much as possible. Even if we paid attention to quality, it was only to check whether they were legal. Our future policy, in addition to continuing to increase the quantity, should especially focus on improving the quality, and we should provide practical guidance to make each cooperative a successful cooperative:</p>
<p>First, we must enable cooperative members to truly cooperate.</p>
<p>Second, we must implement planned control of cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>Third, we must promote production cooperatives and consumer cooperatives simultaneously.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must ensure that cooperative enterprises are operated according to economic principles.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must promote the federation of cooperative enterprises and the creation of a cooperative network.</p>

<p>Disagreement with Increasing Japanese Administrative Power</p>
<p>Returning the Concession to China is the Fairest Principle</p>
<p>London. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement inadvertently omitted 323 ballots when re-electing foreign directors on the 24th of this month. The Consular Body there has declared the election invalid and scheduled a re-vote for the 20th and 21st of this month. The Manchester Guardian has recently commented on this matter, stating that the re-vote may not be sufficient to alleviate political tensions. The Yangjingbang Charter (i.e., the organizational law of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement) may need to be revised. Although the Japanese residents are justified in this decision, we cannot agree with the Japanese residents' desire to expand their administrative power in the concession. The return of the concession to China is the fairest principle, and the residents of all countries express sympathy, with only the Japanese residents dissenting. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Alarming Opium Stockpiles in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Acknowledging the Failure of the Smuggling Interdiction System</p>
<p>Geneva. The League of Nations Permanent Central Opium Board has compiled a statistical report on opium and narcotics for 1934, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. The report states that the stockpiles of raw opium in the Dutch East Indies are sufficient to meet 46 years of consumption. As Chairman Chiang is working hard to obtain the cooperation of various governments to ban opium consumption among overseas Chinese, this statistic is particularly noteworthy. The report also included statistics on drug cases in 1934, with 120,000 drug offenders in the United States and 8,000 in Canada. However, the total amount of drugs seized in both countries throughout the year was only 36 kilograms. Therefore, the report states that the complete failure of the current smuggling interdiction system is undeniable. The report will be discussed at the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee meeting in May. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Geneva. According to a report by Lyall, the former Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs and Director of the League of Nations Permanent Central Opium Board, the current ban on drug trafficking has completely broken down. It has been found that there have been 120,000 isolated opium cases in North America and 8,000 opium users in the United States and Canada. These are all based on reports from the authorities. Not only are there opium users in these two countries, but there must also be secret factories in both countries that manufacture several tons of drugs each year, which can be asserted. If there is no plan to curb legal trade, then smuggling can hardly be stopped. The opium currently stored in the Dutch East Indies is sufficient for 46 years of use, and the Dutch government has been urged to reduce this amount as soon as possible. It has been announced by Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing government, that the Chinese authorities have a responsible plan to curb opium consumption among Chinese people outside China. If these inventories remain, it will be difficult for China to have appropriate cooperation with those countries that have Chinese workers using opium in their territories. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>Ambassador Cheng's Speech in Berlin</p>
<p>Berlin - Mr. Cheng Tianfang, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Germany,</p>
<p>received German dignitaries and foreign</p>
<p>newspaper reporters at the embassy last night, engaging in sincere discussions to dispel</p>
<p>misunderstandings about China among Western countries.</p>
<p>He stated that many people in Europe and America still do not fully understand China,</p>
<p>mistakenly believing it to be a semi-civilized</p>
<p>country. This is a gross error. It should be known that China is one of the most ancient</p>
<p>nations, and its political, social, economic, cultural,</p>
<p>and technological organizations and achievements have persisted for centuries without decline. Since recent times, it has increasingly come into contact with Western civilization.</p>
<p>It has realized that some of its ancient academic thoughts</p>
<p>can no longer meet the requirements of the present era. This is particularly evident in the political</p>
<p>sphere, hence the outbreak of the 1911</p>
<p>Revolution, which overthrew imperial autocracy, and established</p>
<p>the Republic of China. Finally, in 1927, the</p>
<p>National Government was established, with its capital in Nanjing. Since then, despite internal</p>
<p>and external troubles, efforts in construction have never</p>
<p>slacked off, and have instead made great strides. In education and</p>
<p>transportation construction, the results have been even more satisfactory. Currently,</p>
<p>over 10,000 Chinese youths are studying abroad to pursue advanced academic studies.</p>
<p>The government spends over 20 million yuan annually on this.</p>
<p>In recent years, the nationwide highway</p>
<p>network is nearing completion. Over 60,000 kilometers of new highways have already been built,</p>
<p>and another 40,000 kilometers are under construction. Simultaneously, there has been much</p>
<p>addition and development in railways and aviation.</p>
<p>Nine national airline routes have already been officially</p>
<p>opened. Considering that China's aviation construction</p>
<p>is only a recent endeavor of the last decade, such achievements are indeed</p>
<p>gratifying. The New Life Movement, currently being vigorously promoted,</p>
<p>aims to educate the Chinese people in a more</p>
<p>disciplined and organized way of life, in order to promote the</p>
<p>general happiness of the people.</p>
<p>He further added that he recently saw an article in a Western newspaper that</p>
<p>judged the Chinese Nationalist Party as a "national Bolshevikization movement."</p>
<p>In fact, upon closer examination of the Chinese Nationalist Party's platform and the doctrines it advocates,</p>
<p>there is no general communist</p>
<p>ideology. This is a clear example of Westerners misunderstanding Chinese society.</p>
<p>Fortunately, enlightened individuals in various countries have already understood that there is no distinction between Eastern and Western civilizations,</p>
<p>and that they should be connected and advanced together. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that people from all walks of life in Europe and America</p>
<p>can adopt this attitude and view, in order to strive for</p>
<p>the cultural, economic, and political cooperation between major Eastern and Western countries. (United Nations Electric News, 28th)</p>

<p>A Powerful Warrior of the Minseitō Party</p>
<p>Agrees to Support Baba's Financial Policies</p>
<p>Tokyo - Machida, the president of the Minseitō Party, visited Prime Minister Hirota at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th</p>
<p>to recommend Ogawa Gotaro as Minister of Commerce and Industry. The appointment ceremony was held on the same day. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Prime Minister Hirota was extremely cautious about Ogawa Gotaro's entry into the cabinet</p>
<p>as Minister of Commerce, carefully considering whether his financial policies</p>
<p>contradicted those of Baba. Therefore, before deciding on his entry into the</p>
<p>cabinet, he consulted with Army Minister Terauchi and Finance Minister Baba</p>
<p>and exchanged opinions with Ogawa on his understanding of the current situation and</p>
<p>financial policies. Only after confirming that Ogawa's</p>
<p>opinions were consistent with the cabinet's policies did he decide to allow him to enter the</p>
<p>cabinet. Ogawa is a financial and economic authority within the Minseitō Party.</p>
<p>He has always supported Takahashi's financial policies, advocating thorough and sound</p>
<p>financial principles and a policy of both military and agricultural strength, and advocating the gradual reduction of deficit</p>
<p>bonds and national defense expenditures. Therefore, even if he entered the</p>
<p>cabinet as Minister of Commerce and Industry, if his financial policies disagreed with those of Finance Minister Baba,</p>
<p>the cabinet would be divided, which would be a major problem. Therefore, they exchanged opinions on the fundamental understanding of the current situation</p>
<p>and also fully exchanged opinions with Finance Minister Baba. As a result, Ogawa, also recognizing</p>
<p>the changes in the current situation, agreed to support Baba's financial policies. Finance Minister Baba also supported Ogawa's entry into the</p>
<p>cabinet. Although the Hirota cabinet lost Kawasaki Takugo, who had political skills, it gained</p>
<p>Ogawa, a financial authority, which is truly beneficial to the Hirota cabinet. (Dentsu News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Ogawa Gotaro</p>
<p>Tokyo - The newly appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>in the emergency cabinet, Ogawa</p>
<p>Gotaro, is a learned Doctor of Law and a politician with rich</p>
<p>political talent. He is a native of Okayama Prefecture, 61 years old.</p>
<p>In the 36th year of Meiji (1903), he graduated from the Department of Political Science at Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>and was appointed as a lecturer at Kyoto Imperial University, later becoming an assistant</p>
<p>professor. In the 39th year of Meiji (1906), he studied in Germany and then went to Austria,</p>
<p>Italy, France, Belgium, and other countries to study finance and economics, examining the political and economic systems of various countries.</p>
<p>In the 40th year of Meiji (1907), he returned to China and became a professor. In the 2nd year of Taisho (1913), he received a Doctor of Law degree. The following year, he attended the peace conference</p>

<p>Market Fluctuations Intensify</p>
<p>Paris - This afternoon, rumors spread here that the government might</p>
<p>issue an order prohibiting gold exports, causing the Paris market to experience significant</p>
<p>fluctuations. There were also reports that the Bank of France would soon raise its discount rate.</p>
<p>International bonds were in short supply, and prices soared.</p>
<p>At the same time, Britain is actively assisting the franc with its equalization fund. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The selling pressure on the French franc intensified today.</p>
<p>The British equalization fund had to work even harder to maintain it. Although this measure</p>
<p>ultimately stabilized the Anglo-French exchange rate at a price of 75.04,</p>
<p>the level of anxiety can be seen in the sharp rise in the forward gold discount rate.</p>
<p>The French franc discount rate has risen sharply:</p>
<p>one month is discounted at 2.215, and three months at</p>
<p>4.25. The insurance premium for preventing the devaluation of the French currency,</p>
<p>insuring for one month, is currently charged at 34 percent per annum, and</p>
<p>the insurance premium for three months is only 22.5 percent.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is widely regarded, as it shows that</p>
<p>public opinion believes that the devaluation of the French currency is likely to occur during the period between the first and second rounds of the French elections. The date of the first round</p>
<p>is April 26, and the second round is May 3.</p>
<p>Statistical reports on the French elections state that if the first round shows a trend towards the left wing,</p>
<p>the escape of French capital may reach a level where the government must prohibit cash exports.</p>
<p>The US-French exchange rate is currently 15.185. This price makes it profitable to transport gold from Paris to the US,</p>
<p>so there are rumors that French banks will soon raise interest rates. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Bank of France's discount rate has been raised from 3.5% to 5% today. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris - Speculators are now active in pressuring the franc, but</p>
<p>it is very risky because the Bank of France may raise its discount</p>
<p>rate, and banks will unanimously reduce credit extensions, in order</p>
<p>to curb speculative trends. It is expected that the authorities will not</p>
<p>prohibit cash exports. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Recent Situation in the Six Counties of Chahar North <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Mongolians wholeheartedly support the Central Government. Japanese pressure on Mongolia intensifies.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: In order to complete their defensive line against Russia, the Japanese are eager to extend their influence in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. First, they ordered the puppet troops of Li Shouxin to occupy major counties such as Zhangbei in order to cut off the transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulu. Next, they planned to gradually extend their influence to western Suiyuan, so that in the event of an emergency, they could prevent the Russian army from moving east. Therefore, in the past three months, they have been carrying out large-scale activities centering on the six counties of Zhangbei. On one hand, they made Zhuo Shihai the head of the puppet Chahar Supervisory Office in order to control the various banner princes. On the other hand, they surrounded Prince De and persuaded him to form a puppet Mongolian state. The main purpose of this move is to control western Mongolia with eastern Mongolia and to control outer Mongolia with inner Mongolia, so as to separate Chahar and Suiyuan from Chinese territory without wasting a single soldier. They had planned this repeatedly before. The Mongolian army once planned to invade Zhangyuan in the south and Suiyuan in the west, but Ni Guanzhou and Wu Heling explained the great righteousness to the Mongolian army authorities and strongly argued that it should not be done, so it was not realized. However, Ni was assassinated, which shows how fierce the enemy is. Prince De is one of the more promising princes among the Mongolian princes, and the Japanese have long won him over and used him as a puppet. Since the fall of the six counties of Zhangbei, a large number of Japanese officials have been stationed in Prince De's mansion to plan everything and have been sent to various banners to monitor them. However, Prince De, in view of the psychology of the princes of the various banners, strongly opposed it, so Xiong Lingmo did not dare to take any action. After the Joint Committee of the Two Mongolias explicitly ordered the organization, the princes of western Mongolia expressed their firm refusal to accept what the Japanese were planning and strongly advised eastern Mongolia to wholeheartedly support the Central Government. The national ideology of the people of Inner Mongolia has thus become more intense. The recent situation in the six counties of Zhangbei is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Military</p>
<p>In the eastern part of Chahar, there are no formal Japanese troops stationed at present. There are only two brigades and six regiments of the puppet Mongolian First Army under Li Shouxin, including one infantry four and a battalion regiment, two heavy artillery pieces, sixteen mortars, and 2,400 people, and more than 600 riders in civilian clothes from the puppet Mongolian Second Army under Bao Zicheng. As for the garrison of the puppet army, the puppet First Army garrisoned one battalion of infantry in Guyuan, one company of cavalry in Kangbao, one regiment of cavalry in Shangdu, two battalions of cavalry in Wutaizi, one company of Baocheng student soldiers, and one company of cavalry in Shangyi (newly established county). The puppet Second Army garrisoned one hundred cavalrymen in Chongli (newly established county) and three hundred cavalrymen in Dehua (i.e. Huade). The rest were all stationed in Zhangbei. Outside Zhangbei, there is an airfield, covering an area of 26 hectares. Two teams of the Japanese Kwantung Army Special Service Detachment are also stationed there, with four tanks, twenty-four trucks, and four armored vehicles. The puppet army's guns are not very complete. There are Suin, Type 38 breeches, etc., of which Suin are the most. The commanders of the two puppet armies are nominally Li Shouxin and Bao Zicheng, but in reality they are the head of the Dolon Special Service Agency, Tanaka Hisashi. He is ordered by the Kwantung Army Headquarters with the title of advisor and responds to all military opportunities. Recently, due to the weak strength of the puppet army, the strong selected strong men from the six counties and the Chahar League to undergo military training, with the intention of expanding the army.</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>Most of the county heads of the six counties have been replaced, and the county administration is controlled by local tyrants. The power is in the hands of the Japanese advisors. The situation is no different from the puppet organizations in the Northeast. The names of the six county heads and advisors are as follows: Guo Shoushan, head of the puppet Guyuan County, advisor: Ikushima; Bai Yiming, head of the puppet Kangbao County, advisor: Kuo Wei; the head of the puppet Shangdu County is unknown, advisor: Tokusugi; the head of the puppet Baochang County is unknown, advisor: Rikimoto; the head of the puppet Dehua County is unknown, advisor: Sun Lang; Zhu Minchi, the head of the puppet Zhangbei County, advisor: Osu. The heads of the six counties absorbed the people's marrow in extraordinary circumstances, and the donations and taxes have increased several times than before. They used political power to oppress the people, so they could not resist.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>After the fall of the six counties of Zhangbei, the economy was extremely poor, and commerce was declining day by day. It is said that the Japanese side intends to invest 700,000 yuan to operate the six counties. These large amounts of money are all supplied by the puppet Central Bank of Manchuria in the form of counterfeit currency issued. The counterfeit currency of the bank has been circulating a lot in the six counties, and it is said that it intends to set up a branch in Zhangyuan, which will be established in early April.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The main traffic artery is the railway, followed by the highway. The Japanese have long planned to complete the railway from Chifeng to Dolon in August. The highway from Chengde to Dolon is already passable by automobiles. The Zhangduo railway line has been started. On the already repaired roads in the six counties, the roads have been re-laid with sand and gravel. As for telegraph and telephone, there is a management bureau in Zhangbei to supervise the telecommunications of the counties, and there is also a short-wave radio station. The communication time is from 10:00 pm to 12:00 pm, the wavelength is 150 meters, and the antenna direction is southward.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Severe Situation of Seawalls Along the Zhejiang Coast <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Tidal Surge is Fierce and Level with the Pond Trees. The Shore is Precariously Endangered, and Construction is Rushed to Repair It.</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: The coastal counties of Zhejiang Province have built more than 300 miles of seawalls to protect against floods. However, the seawalls have been in disrepair for many years due to lack of funds, and dangerous situations have arisen. Every spring and autumn tidal period, there is a risk of accidents. This year, due to more spring rain, the tide is particularly large, and the seawalls are in imminent danger. Recently, I learned that the Construction Department received a telegram from the Water Conservancy Bureau yesterday, reporting from the Hangzhou-Pingduan Engineering Office, saying that the recent tidal surges coincided with the moon's approach to the earth, and the tides were particularly turbulent. The largest tides were on the 25th and 26th of this month. When they came, the southern tide directly hit the seawalls. After colliding with the seawalls, the waves soared upwards, level with the willows on the seawalls. The fierce tidal surge was unprecedented during the spring floods of previous years. Chen Liyi, the engineer of the section, led the staff to patrol day and night. The stones of the danger pond with the Bing character number were sucked out by the tide, and the situation was serious. The pond foot of the Gongmao character number sank, and the seawall leaned outward, which was very dangerous. It was decided that the seawall was attacked by the tide, and a huge hole was pierced in the seawall, three meters long. The pond stones were hanging precariously and were in imminent danger. In addition, the cracks in the Du character number increased, and the topsoil of the Gaozhong character number had become a deep hole, which must be rushed to repair. After a telegram was sent to the Haiyan Engineering Team to take on the task of rushing to repair, they worked hard to rush to build it, so as to avoid a major disaster. After receiving the report, Zhou Zhenlun, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, set off this morning to inspect the seawalls and ordered them to rush to repair them.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Amidst High Rice Prices, Guangdong Province Bans Rice Exports <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Various Counties in the Interior Have Decided to Implement the Ban. The Rice Merchants' Association Urges the Implementation of the Rice Ban. Guangzhou Communication: Rice prices in Guangdong Province have risen sharply recently. Until this week, the price increase was even more severe. Due to the excessive purchase of local grains produced in Heyuan and Huizhou in the Dongjiang area by foreign merchants, exports have been banned. The rice prices in Zhaoqing and Sanshui in the Xijiang area have also risen compared to before. Due to the excessive purchase of rice by the Guangdong gang, the rice price in Wuzhou, Guangxi Province, the source of grain for Xijiang, has also been affected. The Wuzhou Chamber of Commerce has submitted a petition to the Cangwu County government, requesting the implementation of a rice ban to maintain the local people's food supply, which is expected to be implemented during the day. If Wuzhou bans rice exports, then the grain supply in western Guangdong will be even more insufficient. As for the Beijiang area, Nanxiong was originally a rice-producing area in Beijiang, but because of the sparse import of foreign rice, the demand for local grain exceeds the supply. The military food in southern Jiangxi also depends on the grain of Nanxiong. A few days ago, Nanxiong white rice was worth only more than eight yuan per load (100 catties), but now the price has suddenly increased. Yesterday, each 100 catties was sold for more than ten yuan, and there is still no stored grain on the market. It is generally speculated that the price may continue to rise. In addition, Zhongshan County in the central district was also a rice-rich area in the past, but recently the grain price has soared, and white rice has been flowing out more and more. The Zhongshan County Government specifically announced a ban on the export of grain on the 17th and stipulated that within ten days from the 17th of this month, no grain exports are allowed in the county. During the ten-day restriction period, each ferry boat is not allowed to carry more than 20 bags of grain, and other ships are only allowed to store grain for their own use and are not allowed to carry grain. If there is any smuggling exceeding the quota, it will be confiscated once discovered. Since various counties have banned rice exports, rice merchants from all over the country have had to gather in Guangzhou City. Since the 19th, rice merchants from the Shantou gang and the Jiangmen gang have been competing for white rice in the city. For a time, the Guangzhou rice market had a scene of guests coming as if returning home. The rice price also rose several times a day. It is estimated that ordinary white rice is worth more than nine yuan per 100 catties, and has risen to more than ten yuan and several corners. The Rice Merchants' Association believes that the demand for rice exceeds the supply, and foreign merchants continue to purchase it. In this situation, it is not difficult to cause a rice famine in the city. Yesterday, a meeting of rice merchants was specially convened to discuss solutions. It was unanimously decided to petition the provincial government to strictly prohibit the export of grain in order to maintain the people's food supply. The original petition said, "Petition for the soaring rice price and the panic of the people's food supply, begging for permission to ban rice exports to relieve the people's livelihood. The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the most important thing for the people. This has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so today. From the former Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, the Guangdong Provincial Government has generally strictly prohibited the export of local rice, but it is allowed to be transferred within the inland without taxes or levies. This is precisely to maintain the people's food supply and protect the people's livelihood. In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the low price of grain, the government had to endure the pain of lifting the ban in order to protect agricultural production. However, the stamp duty for rice orders is still only one point for every ten yuan or more, intending to reduce the cost of rice by one point, so that the people's food supply will benefit by one point. Who is not grateful for the government's utmost intention to protect the people? But today, the world is in recession, and prices are rising strangely. Rice prices are soaring even more. Currently, only nine catties of coarse rice can be obtained for each yuan, and the general poor people want to cry without tears. Newspaper reports have been published for days, saying that counties such as Zhongshan, Qingyuan, Dongguan, and Huiyang have banned rice exports. The association has seen this and convened the rice industry to discuss and study it. They all believe that the rice price is so high that the people's food supply is in a panic. The government should immediately implement a ban on rice exports to provide relief. It has been passed and recorded in the minutes. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to your government for review and approval. The people of Baiyue will be grateful for your great kindness." (March 23)</p>

When I asked the residents, I learned that Commander Chen and Special Commissioner Yu were going to give a speech to the people, and the village chiefs and heads of the baojia system were gathering them by sounding the gongs. I wanted to catch the extra train to Zhao Liqiao and then transfer to Chongyang, so I rushed to the station. After a while, the train arrived, but because it was a coal train, it did not sell passenger tickets. So I stored my luggage near the station and returned to the city to visit Zhongshan Park, which was built by the First Army, and Guanlan Pavilion outside the city. The pavilion was built on a mountain, not far from the city, and there was a tower that could be climbed. The city walls, rivers, and mountains were all clearly visible. It was the only scenic spot in the county, but unfortunately the buildings were in disrepair and many had collapsed. At 2:00 PM, I left the city and followed the road to the station. The road was built by Li Jue's 19th Division of the Xiang Army when they were stationed in Puqi. The two or three li from the city to the station were quite wide, but now it is gradually damaged. Trees were planted on both sides, but they were all broken by passersby. They were planted and then withered, which shows the lack of public spirit among the people of Puqi. When the division built this road, they used soldiers as laborers, without spending a single coin from the local government or conscripting a single civilian. The discipline was excellent, and there was nothing like it at the time. No wonder the people of Puqi still praise them today. When I arrived at the station, the train had not yet arrived, so I wandered around nearby. Behind the station was a fortress with the words "Hunan-Hubei Fortress" written on it. On its side were two pavilions, one named Qing'an and the other Zhengxia, both built by the Fourth Division of the stationed army last autumn. Qing'an was built to commemorate the suppression of the Red bandits, and Zhengxia was meant to encourage the troops to be well-prepared and at ease. At that time, there was no information about the southbound train, so I went to a nearby teahouse to brew tea and wait. There were already two soldiers from the 35th Brigade in the seat. Before long, a young soldier, about twelve or thirteen years old, burst into the building and mistook me for the owner. He demanded gambling equipment from me. I asked with a smile, "What kind of gambling equipment do you need?" He replied proudly that he could do anything. The discipline of the brigade needs to be rectified urgently. This little soldier is a glimpse of the whole. Soon, a battalion commander led several company commanders into the building, saying that they were waiting for the train to Yangloudong to take over the defense. The entire battalion of local soldiers was gathered on the platform waiting to depart. However, after only a few minutes, a phone call came from the brigade headquarters, ordering them to go north to Xianning. Therefore, they could not take the same train as me. At 4:00 PM, the train arrived. I bought a ticket and boarded the train. The bumps were the same as before, and the hawkers' shouts were also the same as before. At around 5:00 PM, I arrived at Zhao Liqiao and got off the train. The sun had already set. I unpacked my luggage at the inn. At night, officers from the 35th Brigade led two soldiers to check on me. Their attitude was still amiable. The place is also a famous town in Puqi. There are dozens of inns, several restaurants, and I heard there are also several opium dens. Further south, it is not very peaceful. The former residence of He Guoguang, the current chief of staff of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, is only a few miles away. Last autumn, the Red bandits plotted to kidnap his mother, but fortunately the guards were able to rescue her and prevent it. She has now been taken to Wuchang for care, which shows that this place is not a paradise. However, because the Hunan-Hubei Road runs through it and the army travels back and forth constantly, the bandits dare not occupy it. At the inn, I met Mr. Ren, who works at the Security Office in Fujian and is from Puqi. I chatted with him and one or two other people from Puqi. According to them, there were incidents of soldiers killing the people's cattle while suppressing bandits in the countryside, and they said that the location was Dawutai, not far from Hongxia. They said that the senior officers of the 25th Brigade were still able to love the people, and the discipline of the army was also strengthened. It was heard that when they were stationed in Chongyang, many soldiers smoked in opium dens. Brigade Commander Li was furious and shot several people, but it was difficult to stop them. It can be seen that those who do evil are ignorant soldiers. I also heard two things at the inn that the government authorities should pay attention to. First, the collection of land taxes. The land tax in Puqi is not very heavy, and the people can afford it. However, the method of collection seems to be inappropriate. The land tax collectors go to the countryside to collect the tax. In addition to the quota, they inevitably ask for extra money, and the village chiefs and heads of the baojia system must provide food. Not only do the people suffer, but the village chiefs and heads of the baojia system also complain. Second, the theft of cattle is rampant. There is a famous thief in the county named Zhang Xiangtai, who makes a living by stealing cattle in the countryside. The farmers are afraid of him stealing, so they have to pay taxes to Zhang, called "drawing a square." Each water buffalo pays 1,000 cash per month, and a yellow cow pays 500 cash per month. I had heard about this before, but I didn't expect it to still exist today.</p>
<p>I got up at 7:00 AM on the 23rd and went to the bus station. I was told that the bus would leave at 9:00 AM, so I went back to the inn for a short rest. When I went again at 8:00 AM, the bus had already left. This road goes directly to Chongyang, which used to be very inconvenient for travelers. The bus road was only completed last autumn. I missed the bus because of a misinterpretation of the station's scheduled departure time and a failure of the inn's tea servant to respond. I regret it very much. However, according to the locals, the road is uneven and very bumpy. Riding the bus once is like being sick once. If it is not urgent or if you are saving money, it is still better to take a sedan chair. At that time, I had no other way to remedy the situation, so I had to hire a sedan chair to go to Chongyang.</p>
<p>From Zhao Liqiao to Yangloudong is eight li. The area is a gathering place for tea leaves, and commerce is quite prosperous. More than ten li to Fenshiling is the border between Puqi and Chongyang. In these twenty li, many mountains are planted with tea, which is lush and lovely. Every li has several waterfalls, and their sound is clear and melodious. The mountain scenery, stream light, spring sounds, and bird songs along the way make people feel relaxed and happy. I was afraid of walking too fast and not being able to linger. When I arrived at Yangloudong, soldiers from the 35th Brigade stopped the road to check. I was slightly defeated. However, they were performing their duties, so it was no wonder. Thirty-two li from here is Guihuashu. The soldiers of the brigade also checked me again, which was stricter than before, which shows that it is gradually approaching the bandit area. After entering the Chongyang border, the mountains were higher and longer. Tea was also planted intermittently on the mountains, with terraces like ladders. Those with white patches like stitched marks were formerly planted with tea, but now they have stopped planting. There are many stones in the mountains, so there are few forests. The fields at the foot of the mountains do not worry about floods or droughts. It is said that they can harvest three crops a year. Now, they mostly plant beans and wheat. There are very few pedestrians on the road, and few farmers can be seen in the fields, because it is not the busy farming season yet. I arrived in Chongyang at 6:00 PM. It is surrounded by mountains, and only here is there flat land. On the walls of the houses outside the city and on the city walls, there are large slogans, such as "Support the only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek," "Thoroughly eliminate the Red bandits," and "The people who are tempted by the bandits are innocent," which are enough to show the tension of the bandit suppression work. The 40th Division of Liu Peixu is stationed here. After entering the city, I was subjected to strict inspections. In one day, I had been inspected three times. After entering the city, I stayed at the Chongtong Hotel. I had not eaten all day and was very hungry. I tried to find a solution. After visiting various places, I learned that yesterday, near the pillbox in Yangloudong, a bean seller was hiding three yuan and was robbed and killed. There were two knife wounds in his throat, and his body was lying on the road. At the same time, a murder case of a Red bandit also occurred in Guihuashu. The murdered person was a person who had been a member of the anti-communist volunteer team. Both cases occurred during the day. This is the place where I felt relaxed and happy and lingered. The time difference was only one day. I saw that the army's inspection was strict, and I suspected that it was near the bandit area. I did not expect it to be in the bandit area. Someone joked that I was very brave. If I had encountered bandits on the way, seeing that my clothes were neat and my luggage was full, would they not have welcomed me to go with them? After hearing about it, I was very frightened. (Sent from Chongyang on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Baoshan Zhu Police Officer's Resignation Approved</p>
<p>Changxingsha, the first district of this county, is located on the coast and is important for water and land public security. Therefore, in addition to the public security sub-station, there is also a water patrol team under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau. Police officer Zhu E, who has been in office for more than a year, has worked hard on baojia and anti-smoking matters. During the winter defense period, he supervised the long police officers and patrolled all night, without slackening despite the wind, frost, rain, and snow. Recently, Police Officer Zhu resigned to the county government due to an incident. In addition to requesting Police Officer Zhu to stay, the villagers jointly submitted a request to the county government, signed by the township and village chiefs and merchants, requesting that he be retained. Township Chief Shi Xixuan and Township Chief Shen Zhiying also asked District Chief Xu Jiqin to personally meet with Acting County Magistrate Bai and Public Security Section Chief Tang Renjie to state the enthusiasm of Police Officer Zhu's work over the past year and requested that he be retained. Unfortunately, Police Officer Zhu's determination to leave was firm, and the county government has approved his resignation. He left Sha at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month. At that time, the entire Sha people gathered to see him off. It is said that the new appointee is Gao Xichang, the former director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau.</p>

After deliberation, it was decided to issue a serious warning to Jin, urging him to repent and formally apologize.</p>
<p>Wuxi Nine-Year-Old Girl Buried in Fire</p>
<p>In Li Jiali, near Jian'an Bridge in Houzhai Town, the eighth district of the county, lived Li Zou, a widow. Her husband had passed away, leaving behind a nine-year-old girl named Zhao Mei. She usually farmed for a living and her family was poor. Yesterday morning, Li Zou went to work in the fields as usual and ordered Zhao Mei to guard the door. At about 11:00 AM, Zhao Mei was cooking lunch at home when she accidentally left the fire in the firewood, causing a fire. In an instant, the fire broke through the roof. Residents nearby saw the situation and immediately sounded the alarm. The Jian'an Bridge, Fangqiao, Houzhai and other water dragons arrived at the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour of burning, it was extinguished. A house had been reduced to ashes. The nine-year-old girl, Zhao Mei, was unable to escape and was buried in the fire. The corpse has now been dug out, with a scorched head and face and the body separated. It was a tragic sight. Her mother, seeing the situation, cried to the heavens and wailed in agony. Those who heard it were also saddened.</p>

<p>Changshu Tragic Sinking of a Ship</p>
<p>The old Wushi township shuttle boat traveling to and from here sank suddenly at Qing Bridge on the afternoon of the 27th due to carrying too many passengers. All the passengers on board were declared dead. As a result, two people died and many more are missing. There is a Tongda Shipping Company outside the Green East Gate that travels to and from the urban area of ​​Meili Wushi. The other day, because of the Shangsi incense festival, there were many passengers going to the countryside. The company only had a small steamship with a towboat, carrying more than 100 passengers. There were also more than 20 passengers on the steamship. Unexpectedly, when traveling to Tangqiao, the steamship was difficult to steer due to the heavy load, causing it to slightly hit the bridge pier. However, the driver did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, after traveling less than a few feet, the boat sank completely to the bottom of the water. The passengers completely entered the water. At that time, the sound of crying shook the sky. The situation was tragic. Immediately, they joined forces with the villagers to rescue them. After about two hours, a total of 19 people were rescued, including a Minghui Xue and a child, who had already died. The wheel bureau's accountant, manager, and boss have all been detained to the police station. The county government sent officials to the countryside on the 28th to examine the bodies and make arrangements to salvage the sunken ship and lost items.</p>
<p>District Chief Detained for Smoking Case</p>
<p>Ping Chucai, the district chief of the fifth district of this county, and assistant Ning Guanya, were once secretly accused of smoking by the county. Afterwards, Ping Ning temporarily went to live in Shanghai. After more than a month, they returned to Changshu and surrendered to the county to ask for an examination. After being sent to the County Hospital for examination, it was proved that they were non-addicts. They were immediately sent back to the county government. However, the county magistrate ordered them to be detained because the two had been out for more than a month during the period when they were reported, and there was obvious suspicion of smoking beforehand, and ordered them to be detained and awaiting sentencing.</p>

The flames soared into the sky, and water dragons gathered. Sixteen homes were burned down. It was said that the fire was caused by Ma's nephew burning incense for vaccination. The most amazing thing is that the Jiangtai Bureau was mixed among the burned homes, but it was completely preserved. The local chief, Ha Xudong, saw that most of the affected households were poor, and specially raised many cotton clothes and trousers from philanthropists inside and outside the city to distribute to the victims. At about 7:00 PM on the same afternoon, the thatched house of Zhou, the Great Stage, also caught fire, burning down three neighboring houses to the left and right. It was extinguished at about 8:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e78">New Commander of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Takes Office Yesterday Morning <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Former Concurrent Commander Wu Personally Handles the Transfer / Yang Delivers Speech Vowing to Maintain Public Order</p>
<p>The newly appointed Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander, Mr. Yang Hu, arrived at the headquarters yesterday morning at 10 o'clock to assume his duties. The outgoing concurrent commander, Mayor of Shanghai, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, personally went to handle the transfer. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Inauguration Ceremony: Initially, positions were established along the area from Jinyi Bridge along Jinyi Road and Longhua Road to provide security. Above the main entrance of the Garrison Headquarters, the crossed flags of the Party and the Nation were hung high. A full military band was also dispatched, standing by to welcome the new commander. Mayor Wu and Commander Yang arrived at the headquarters simultaneously by car at around 9:30. After exchanging brief pleasantries with the guests who came to offer congratulations, they entered the commander's office together to handle the handover procedures. Mayor Wu personally handed over the official seal to Commander Yang. The ceremony concluded in about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Guests: Among those from all circles who came to offer congratulations were former Director of the Ministry of Interior Xu Xiuzhi, Director of the Customs Administration Zheng Lai, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya (represented by Wu Huanru), Supervisory Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters Wang Yansong, as well as Lu Bohong, Yu Qiaqing, senior officials of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, chiefs of various branch bureaus, captains of security teams, and representatives of various seafarer party branches and seafarer associations, totaling over two hundred people. Furthermore, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi sent a silver shield inscribed with "Dignified Seated Command", and Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Cai Jinjun sent a silver shield inscribed with "Illustrious Achievements". There were many congratulatory gifts.</p>
<p>Wu's Speech: At 10:00 a.m. sharp, the new and outgoing commanders gathered all staff members in the headquarters' auditorium for instructions. Guests from all parties also participated. First, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, roughly stating that he was today handing over the duties of concurrent commander to Commander Yang. During his tenure as the director of the Municipal Security Bureau, Commander Yang assisted him in maintaining local public order, achieving remarkable results. The public order in Shanghai has been very good in recent years, which is widely praised by the local people. Now that Commander Yang is transferred to command the Shanghai-Woosung garrison, it will not only assist him but also further consolidate local public order. He hoped that all members of the headquarters and local military police would follow Commander Yang with the same spirit of obedience they had shown him. Commander Yang has served in Shanghai for many years and is an advanced comrade of the Party. He has made outstanding contributions to the Party and the country. All members of the headquarters are very honored to be under the leadership of Commander Yang.</p>
<p>Yang's Speech: Mayor, distinguished guests, comrades, today is my first day on the job. I am very honored by your presence and guidance. During my tenure in the Security Bureau, I received the leadership and care of Mayor Wu for more than three years, allowing the local area to be peaceful. All the people in our city should thank Mayor Wu for his leadership. Now that Mayor Wu has repeatedly declined the concurrent position of Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander due to heavy political duties, the Central Government has ordered me to succeed him. I feel an even greater sense of responsibility and inadequacy, fearing that I may not be able to fulfill the role. However, a soldier's duty is to obey. I can only believe in the principles, obey orders, and strive to serve the country and protect the people, without allowing any evasion. I will continue to work diligently and consult with Mayor Wu on matters. Under the supervision of the people of the city, I will do my utmost to fulfill my duties so as not to fail the mission of the nation and the expectations of everyone. I hope that Mayor Wu and all comrades will constantly offer correction and assistance. This is my sincere request today.</p>
<p>Inauguration Notice: After taking office, Mr. Yang immediately posted a notice at the entrance of the headquarters, stating, "Having received the appointment letter from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, appointing Lieutenant General Yang Hu of the Army as the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander, etc., I hereby assume my duties today. In addition to submitting reports separately, this notice is hereby issued for public information. March 28, 25th Year of the Republic, Commander Yang Hu."</p>

The telegram from Mayor of Nanjing Ma Chaojun stated: "I am delighted to learn that you have been honored with a distinguished appointment and received the military command.

<p>Our country's young aviator, Mr. Cao Shi'ang, went to France to study aviation at the Lyon Aviation School in the 19th year of the Republic. He returned to China in the 21st year of the Republic and was welcomed by all circles. He was highly valued by Chairman He Jian of Hunan, who sent Mr. Cao again to study at the Lyon Military Aviation Academy in France, specializing in modern flight skills and aircraft manufacturing. After graduating this spring, he was immediately hired by the school as a special-appointed colonel instructor. Mr. Cao has won the highest-level medals in various French and international aviation competitions he has participated in. The French government has specially appointed Mr. Cao as a member of the country's Aviation Society. It is found that Mr. Cao is the first Chinese student studying aviation in France to have obtained this qualification. Mr. Cao's knowledge and skills are not only rare in the country, but also a valuable asset in France. Recently, due to taking a teaching position at the Central Aviation School, Mr. Cao originally intended to fly back to China via Europe and Africa in his own aircraft. However, due to the Italo-Ethiopian War, the flights of foreign aircraft were prohibited, so he had to stop. He then changed to the French mail ship General Chaffee to return to China. He departed from Marseille on the 3rd of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 2nd. It is reported that Mr. Cao's relatives and friends in Shanghai, such as Nie Haifan, are currently preparing a grand welcome.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Provincial Government Orders Shanghai County Government to Clear Accumulated Land Taxes <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Second Installment Collection Deadline Approaching / Third Installment Begins on April 1st</p>
<p>Jiangsu Department of Finance instructs the Shanghai County Government: "Upon investigation, the clearing of accumulated land taxes from previous years in various counties was originally set at a certain percentage to be collected in installments. The period from the date of the document to January 23 of this year was the first installment. From January 24 to the end of March was the second installment. From April to the end of June was the third installment. Supplementary matters were issued and ordered to be followed. Now that the first installment has passed and the second installment is approaching, the amount audited and submitted is still very small. According to inquiries, the households often use the provisions of Article 3 of the land tax clearing method, which stipulates that for arrears of more than three years, half of the total arrears for each year must be paid by the end of February of the 25th year of the Republic, and the remaining half must be paid off before the end of the 25th year of the Republic, as an excuse to delay payment, resulting in no improvement. It is not known that the accumulated land taxes of previous years have been set to be collected in installments. How can there be any delay? Moreover, the provisions of Article 3 are set up for the remission of overdue fines and should not be confused. The county magistrate should make a clear announcement and speed up the active and strict urging. If there is no response, they should follow Chairman Chiang's telegram and implement detention and forced pursuit, without any slackness or delay. In addition to distributing separately, it is ordered that the county magistrate must comply."</p>

<p>Zhu Xueying Receiving Medical Treatment After Escaping from the Brothel - Yang Dazhen Willing to Treat Zhu's Illness - Yang Ordered to Pay 200 Yuan Guarantee</p>
<p>Zhu Xueying, a woman from Songjiang, 18 years old, was formerly a prostitute in the Sichunlou brothel. Due to the economic downturn, Sichunlou closed down, and Zhu was sold to Yang Dazhen (nickname "Xiao Niangyi"), a Qingjiang woman who operated a brothel at No. 15, Lane 604, Fuzhou Road, where she has been a prostitute for a long time. Following a report by the Citizens' Association, Inspector Fang Te of the Zhabei Police Station arrested Yang and sent Zhu to the Jiliang Institute for temporary shelter. This case has been reviewed once by the Special Court No. 1, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Qian Hongye of the Special Court No. 1 continued the hearing in the criminal division. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Zhu Xueying had been examined by Renji Hospital and found to have contracted venereal disease to the highest degree, which also caused her throat ailment and was highly contagious. Treatment would cost at least over 100 yuan. The police knew that the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital could treat this disease, but the cost should be borne by someone designated by the court. Furthermore, the Jiliang Institute feared the disease would spread to others, so it requested the court to take action quickly. Zhu Xueying testified that at the age of 14, her sister-in-law, Wei Jinyun, sold her to Sichunlou. When Sichunlou closed, the madam sold her to the defendant for 400 yuan. Initially, she solicited customers at Yuren Lane on Yunnan Road. Later, she went to the Tianyunlou above the Wujin Primary School on Fuzhou Road. The defendant had not abused her usually, only scolding her occasionally. When questioned, Yang Dazhen was willing to treat Zhu's illness and hired lawyer Fan Gang for her defense. Judge Qian then ordered that the case be pronounced next Friday, and Yang Dazhen was ordered to pay 200 yuan in cash or provide a shop guarantee, and to submit 120 yuan to the court for Zhu's medical expenses.</p>

<p>Zhang Zuming, a 30-year-old Ningbo native and shareholder of Ruichangshun Hardware Store at No. 101 Broadway, was arrested in June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China in connection with the major robbery case at the CPA firm of Schlomann on Avenue Edward VII. Zhang implicated Zhuang Jimeng, the owner of Zhuangyuan, Wang Lianyou, a hardware peddler, and Tang Qingyue, the head of Dade Sauce Factory. The Special Court No. 2 tried the case and found the four defendants not guilty. The French Police Department repeatedly appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court and the Supreme Court, but the appeals were rejected. After the case was finalized, Zhuang Jimeng, believing that Zhang Zuming had falsely accused him, hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1, accusing Zhang Zuming of false accusation. After the court hearing, the case was transferred to the Special Court No. 2 for trial due to jurisdictional error. The Special Court No. 2 summoned the parties yesterday afternoon, and Judge Li Changnian presided over the hearing in the second court. Zhuang Jimeng stated that the defendant, Zhang Zuming, clearly implicated the merchant as an accomplice while in the French police station, and admitted to distributing 1,000 yuan to the merchant in the car. The merchant was found not guilty after three trials, showing that Zhang Zuming intentionally made a false accusation. The merchant suffered mental and business losses of about 60,000 yuan after being detained. He requested an investigation into the false accusation and sought damages of 50,000 yuan. Zhang Zuming testified that he suffered greatly in the police station, being beaten with wooden sticks and repeatedly slapped. If he did not confess accomplices, he would be subjected to electric shock. Under coercion, he had no choice but to implicate Zhuang and others. However, he and Zhuang were good classmates and had no grudges. He was forced to say it when he was disoriented. Judge Li ordered the investigation to be suspended pending the review of the Supreme Court's files. The case will be tried simultaneously with Zhang Zuming's lawsuit against Zhou Jinggeng for false accusation.</p>
<p>Conspiracy to Murder Husband Attempted Case - Trial Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Verdict - Tian Hesheng and His Wife Zhuang's Lawsuit Over the Ramifications of Adultery</p>
<p>Tian Hesheng, a Shandong native living behind the Hubei Guild Hall on Jumen Road in Nanshi, works for a living. Years ago, he married Zhuang (25 years old), a woman from his hometown, through a matchmaker. They had a three-year-old son. However, Zhuang was unfaithful and had an affair. Tian discovered the affair and reported it to the police, who detained the adulterous couple and sent them to the prosecutor's office of the local court. Friends and relatives intervened, and Tian filed a petition with the court to withdraw the charges. The couple resumed living together, seemingly reconciled. Unexpectedly, Zhuang held a grudge. Last month, she gathered several men and women, claiming to return to Ning, and came to Tian Hesheng's house. They feigned a treat, got Tian drunk, and planned to tie him up with hemp ropes and harm his eyes with lime. Tian noticed that their actions were strange and realized that they were against him. He was outnumbered and shouted for help. Neighbors heard the cries and gathered, and the group fled, only Zhuang and her mother, Zhuang Song (46 years old), were arrested. Tian reported the incident to the Criminal Court of the local court, accusing Tian Zhuang, Zhuang Song, and related persons Tian Houyun and Tang Yili of conspiracy to commit murder and requesting severe punishment according to the law. The police also sent Tian Zhuang, Zhuang Song, Tian Houyun, and Tang Yili to the local court for trial. Judge Shao Qinzhi had conducted a preliminary hearing without a conclusion. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Shao continued the hearing in the Criminal Court No. 5. Tian Hesheng testified about the incident. When questioned, the defendants mutually denied the charges. The judge, believing the case was clear, appointed lawyer Xu Jingyu to defend each defendant. He concluded the hearing and adjourned for sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Wu Baogan Sues Zhu Decai - Wu Xu States Reasons for Extramarital Affair - Husband Imprisoned, Wife Follows Another Man - Claims Inability to Live</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 AM, Police Officer Ge Zhansheng of the Tanzawan Police Station in Zhabei reported that Wu Baogan was holding Zhu Decai and Wu's wife, Xu, claiming that he (the plaintiff) was 37 years old, from Funing (according to the plaintiff), and resided at No. 24, Anji Lane, Haichang Road. He had been arrested a few years ago and served several years in prison. He was now released, but his wife, Xu, had been taken by Zhu Decai. He requested an investigation. Zhu Decai, 40 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 77, Jiazi, Tanzawan, and running an appliance store, stated that Wu was sentenced to eight years in prison for a crime, so his wife followed him (Zhu), and he did not commit adultery with her. Wu had only served three years and was now released on parole. He wanted his wife, and he (Zhu) would let him take her. Wu Xu, 30 years old, from Funing, claimed that because her husband was in prison and could not provide for her, she voluntarily followed Zhu and was not taken by force. After the police officer took the report, he took them to the station. Officer Luo Siwei briefly questioned them and immediately sent them to the Xinzha Branch Bureau for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>

<p>Shanghai Local Court - Seeking Convenience for Lawyers and Litigants - Two Notices from the Lawyers Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued the following notice to all members yesterday:</p>
<p>With reference to Instruction No. 1740 from the Shanghai Local Court: "To notify, upon reading newspaper reports of the Association convening the 217th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, listing several matters for correction by this court, all matters concerning the convenience of litigants are welcomed by this court. However, this court handles numerous civil and criminal cases daily. The points raised in the proposal by member Zhang Yongqing, though possibly true in one or two instances, present practical difficulties. To cite one example and generalize is inadequate. As the member did not specify the date or court of a particular case, this court cannot investigate. As the matter is important, the Association is hereby instructed to explain each point raised by the member and attach correction methods as follows: The presiding judges of the civil and criminal courts should arrive in court on time. However, due to the order of cases, if Case A is scheduled for 9 AM and Case B for 10 AM, and Case A is more complex or the lawyers take longer to debate, extending the time by one hour, the opening time for Case B will inevitably be delayed. Regarding the execution of cases, each judge of this court summons more than 30 cases daily, and hearings are conducted in the courtroom in order. These are the actual circumstances. In the future, if lawyers have doubts about the opening time, they may submit them directly to the President of this court. If they have doubts about the execution of cases, they may directly inquire in writing, and a response will be provided with the reasons. The delivery of judgments, with a few delays during holidays, has been strictly reorganized, and future delivery will be on schedule. The appointment of defense counsel in criminal summary cases is often submitted on the day before or on the day of the hearing, and this court cannot notify them in writing in time, but will still notify them to attend the hearing using expeditious methods, and there have been no omissions in notifying lawyers. Furthermore, this court has established a inquiry office, equipped with inquiry registers and inquiry forms, to facilitate case proceedings and streamline procedures, and lawyers may list facts and state them to the inquiry office for verification. The Association is hereby instructed to notify accordingly." Upon receiving this instruction, the 219th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this Association resolved to notify all members.</p>
<p>With reference to the fact that the delay in court opening times greatly affects litigants, this Association has previously requested the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to reinstate the inquiry procedure for court opening times. Recently, if the court has not opened by the scheduled time, the case details and time may be submitted for inquiry to the judge handling the case to avoid delays. Subsequently, Order No. 3015 from the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court states, "Received. Upon investigation, litigants attending court for hearings, whether civil or criminal, have registration forms. If the court cannot open on time due to any reason, the court clerk may verbally inquire. The Association is hereby instructed to notify accordingly." The 220th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees resolved to notify all members.</p>
<p>Qing-Hu Road - No Tolls Allowed - Those Collected Must Be Returned by the Company</p>
<p>The Qingpu-Shanghai County Road, after its completion, has been subjected to tolls by the so-called Qing-Hu Long-Distance Bus Company for self-owned vehicles passing through. The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, based on reports from city residents, requested correction. The Bureau stated that the Company's failure to report its commencement of operations in advance was already inappropriate, and the unauthorized collection of tolls from self-owned vehicles was a violation of the Inter-Provincial and Municipal Automobile Regulations. In addition to handling the commencement of operations separately, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has ordered the Qingpu County Government to strictly prohibit the unauthorized collection of tolls and to publicly announce the return of tolls already collected. Therefore, owners of private vehicles who have paid tolls on the road may directly reclaim them from the Company.</p>
<p>Fire in a Shantytown in Yaoshui Lane, West Shanghai - Three Shanties Burned Down</p>
<p>A fire broke out in a shantytown behind the Yangsheng Gong Hongfa Factory in Yaoshui Lane, West Shanghai, yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, due to carelessness. The fire spread rapidly due to the dry weather. The fire brigade responded and extinguished the blaze, but three shanties were burned down. The Yaoshui Lane Police Station sent police to summon Wang Zhang, the source of the fire, who confessed that it was caused by her daughter-in-law Sun's carelessness while cooking. She was sent to the Caojiadu Public Security Branch for investigation.</p>
<p>Statement by Person in Charge of the Municipal Public Security Bureau - Details of the Arrest of Communist Party Members at Fudan University - Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to a statement by a person in charge of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the details of the Bureau's arrest of Communist Party members at Fudan University, although reported by domestic and foreign newspapers, still contain inaccuracies and omissions. The detailed circumstances of the case are described below:</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Bureau instructed the Special Affairs Section to select officers and police from the City Central Branch Bureau and the Jiangwan Police Station to handle the matter carefully, adopting the peaceful attitude that has always been maintained when dealing with students. The police arrived at the school at 12:05 AM on the 25th and immediately dispatched police to guard the main routes for security. Meanwhile, staff from the Special Affairs Section entered the men's dormitory and arrested six Communist Party members, including Huang Bashan. Around 2 PM that afternoon, Yang Bopeng, another Communist Party member from the school, was arrested at the Wusong Railway Station. After preliminary interrogation by the Bureau, they were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Three suspects, Hong Shouling, Wang Qinhong, and Zheng Letian, were released on bail after interrogation by the Bureau. Also, when the arrests began at 12:05 AM on the 25th, a female Communist Party member was mixed in the school, and female staff from the Special Affairs Section went to the women's dormitory to make the arrest. At that time, the women's dormitory was closed, and Police Officer Liu Peizhi of the Jiangwan Police Station invited Mr. Chen Yongsen, the Dean of Students, to open the dormitory door. The staff then entered to make the arrest. At this time, the school bell suddenly rang loudly, and a large group of male students came and forcibly took the female student away, surrounded the female staff, tied their hands behind their backs, and took them away to be beaten. They were then imprisoned, and the location was changed every hour for about eight hours. The next morning, their faces were covered, and they were made to stand on a square table in the auditorium while the school students took pictures at will and interrogated them about who was in charge and who instructed them. The female staff insisted that they were arresting Communist Party members under orders, and they were severely beaten. The school authorities then carried them back to the Bureau, where they were unconscious. They were able to speak after resting, and they were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by the Bureau. At 3:30 PM on the 25th, the school students dared to fire guns at the Bureau's police, firing more than 20 shots. Hou Shengzhen, a police officer from the Jiangwan Police Station, was shot in the abdomen and died at 3 PM on the 26th after the bullet was removed by the Red Cross Hospital. Kong Qinglun, a police officer from the Second Detachment, was shot in the face. In addition, Li Beiwu, the captain of the Third Detachment, had two front teeth knocked out, Zhou Zhicheng, the director of the Jiangwan Police Station, was injured in the hand, and Police Officer Liu Peizhi was injured in the hands, face, and waist. Police Sergeants Zhang Jilin and Chen Yushan were injured in the head and feet. Police officers Li Lu, Zheng Jingyun, Liu Kaike, and detectives Zhou Tongchun and Hu Daoxi were also injured in the head, face, hands, and feet. All injured officers and police were sent to the hospital for treatment. At 5 AM on the 26th, Battalion Commander Wang of the Security Brigade led military police into the school for inspection and found three bullet casings and many bayonets, which were sent to the Bureau for examination. On the same day, Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government and Director Cai of the Bureau, together with Director Pan of the Education Bureau and Director Lei sent by the Ministry of Education, discussed six measures for disposal (as seen in previous reports). The school also resumed classes on the same day, and all the military police who were present to suppress the incident were withdrawn at noon on the same day.</p>

<p>Flour Mills Lack Raw Materials, Rush to Purchase Australian Wheat - Totaling 400,000 Bags - First Batch to be Shipped to Shanghai at Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>According to Dagon News Agency, due to the impact of spring wheat crops being affected by floods last spring, production has decreased significantly. Domestic flour mills lack raw materials for flour production. Although they are making every effort to purchase from the people, it is like a drop in the bucket and does not help. Unable to do otherwise, they have stopped production. In January of this year, various factories ordered foreign wheat from foreign firms in Shanghai for import and use. However, due to economic factors, they were unable to purchase large quantities. Among the flour mills, the largest in scale and considered leaders in the industry, such as Fuxin No. 1 and No. 2 factories, and Maoxin factories in Wuxi, have been operating intermittently. According to the Dagon News Agency reporter's investigation of concerns from the flour mill industry in this city yesterday, the factories are deeply affected by the lack of raw materials, which prevents normal operations. The price of flour also cannot be balanced. Several factories with weak capital have declared bankruptcy due to high raw material costs and large fluctuations in flour prices. The industry is currently planning relief measures. Regarding the raw material problem of each factory, colleagues from this city and other cities have raised a large sum of money. Although the financial sector is tightening credit, they plan to be self-reliant and jointly order about 400,000 bags of foreign wheat from Australia, Canada, Chicago, and other places. The first batch, divided into three ships, will be shipped to Shanghai in batches in the middle and late part of next month. These foreign wheat raw materials are expected to last until the new wheat season in China.</p>
<p>Damuqiao Civilian New Village Begins Compiling Baojia - Organizes Labor Service Team - Hosts Children's Tour Group</p>

In addition to the primary school and the people's night school, which have already started, enrolling villagers' children and out-of-school adults, facilities for sanitation and sports are also being actively implemented. To implement the New Life Movement, promote villagers' autonomy, mutual assistance, and unity, they are starting to compile baojia (household registration system) and organize labor service teams.

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Promotes Rural Side Occupations - Organizes Chicken Raising Cooperation - Increases Farmers' Income and Saves Rural Bankruptcy - First Piloting in Gaoqiao and Luxing, Then Promoting Throughout the City</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote rural side occupations and improve farmers' livelihoods, is organizing chicken raising cooperation and formulating cooperative methods. It is first being promoted in Gaoqiao and Luxing districts and issuing a letter to farmers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Farmers - Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Letter to Farmers on Organizing Chicken Raising Cooperation states, "Farmers, in recent years, China's rural areas have been declining and falling, and are about to reach the point of crisis. The economy is becoming increasingly strained, and agricultural production is decreasing year by year. The farmers' pain is increasing bit by bit. This is a fact that everyone knows and everyone feels. Studying the reasons for this, on the one hand, it is caused by frequent natural disasters, etc. On the other hand, it is also due to a lack of remedies. In the current era of scientific progress, it is very important to have suitable major crops, because increasing side occupations can also reduce the crisis of rural economic bankruptcy. However, there are many types of side occupations. Which one should we improve first? Raising chickens has been a side occupation of Chinese farm families since ancient times. Because our country's chicken breeds have not been improved for thousands of years, and we do not pay attention to the work of selecting and breeding, allowing them to reproduce naturally, the chicken breeds have become worse and worse, and the egg production has been affected by this and has become less and less. Therefore, if we want to promote chicken raising, we must first start with improving chicken breeds. The Bureau, in view of this, starting this spring, will first organize chicken raising cooperation in Gaoqiao and Luxing districts to improve chicken breeds and increase production. Once successful, it will be gradually promoted to the rural areas throughout the city. Detailed methods are specified separately. In short, we will first investigate the general situation of cooperative farmers and handle the registration of cooperative farmers, and then distribute one purebred male chick to each household to mate with local hens and breed. We will also guide the method of improved breeding. In this way, not only can the chicken breeds be improved, but also the egg production can be increased. According to the results of research by many people, the average annual egg production of local Chinese hens is only 80 eggs per hen, but the first generation hybrid hens after improvement can increase to 150 eggs. Comparing the two, we can see the importance of improving chicken breeds. If the price of eggs is 2 fen per egg, and the chicken breeds have been improved for one year, each chicken's egg production will increase by 70 eggs. In other words, each chicken can earn an additional 1 yuan and 4 jiao per year. Ten chickens will earn 14 yuan. Furthermore, the Bureau will also guide you to organize chicken egg sales cooperatives to directly transport and sell the eggs, so that the eggs can be sold at a good price. Farmers, organizing chicken raising cooperation, also improving chicken breeds and increasing production, is your urgent need in the current state of rural economic bankruptcy. You must earnestly comply with the Bureau's methods and cooperate to increase your own happiness."</p>
<p>Cooperation Methods - Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Cooperation Methods:</p>
<p>(1) In order to increase farmers' income and save rural bankruptcy, the Bureau is organizing farm side occupation cooperation, temporarily limited to chicken raising cooperation. (2) Chicken raising cooperation aims to improve chicken breeds and increase production by selecting purebred eggs and mating male chicks with local hens for breeding. (3) Appropriate locations in Gaoqiao and Luxing districts of this city will be selected as cooperative experimental zones for pilot implementation. The scope of each district will be approximately 10 to 15 villages, not exceeding 500 households. (4) All proceedings in the chicken raising cooperative zone will be managed by the following institutions and organizations under the supervision and guidance of the Bureau: Gaoqiao District will be managed by the Gaoqiao District Farmers' Association and the Gaoqiao District Rural Improvement Association. Luxing District will be managed by the Luxing District Municipal Committee Office, the Municipal Labor Experiment Field, and the Luxing District Rural Improvement Association. (5) Each district will have one director and one to three instructors, selected and appointed by the Bureau from the above-mentioned institutions and organizations. All positions are voluntary and may be given subsidies when necessary. (6) The purebred male chicks needed for the chicken raising cooperative zone will be supplied by the Minsheng Chicken Farm under special contract with the Bureau at the lowest price, and assistance will be provided for guidance. (7) Before the implementation of cooperation, the investigation and registration of farmers in the cooperative zone should be carried out first, and the number of local male and female chickens in the district should be counted. (8) Local male chickens in the chicken raising cooperative zone will not be allowed to breed, and they will be forced to be sold. The Bureau will issue purebred male chickens to mate with local hens for breeding. (9) The distribution of chicken breeds will be decided by the Bureau in consultation with the director of each district. (10) The chicken breeds issued to farmers will not be charged, but farmers must absolutely obey the Bureau's guidance on chicken raising cooperation. (11) Farmers who receive chicken breeds are responsible for raising and protecting them. If they sell them privately or deliberately harm them, they will be compensated at the price. (12) All farmers in the chicken raising cooperative zone must comply with the Bureau's chicken raising cooperation methods and jointly seek the improvement of chicken breeds. Those who deliberately sabotage will be subject to appropriate punishment depending on the severity of the circumstances. (13) Each cooperative farmer must breed at least 15 to 30 chicks per year, and part of them will be purchased by the Bureau at a reasonable price for promotion. (14) The sale of chicken eggs will be negotiated by the director of each district with the chicken egg vendors for purchase at a good price, and farmers will be guided to organize sales cooperatives. (15) The Bureau may invite chicken raising experts to give lectures on chicken raising methods and guide improvement matters at any time. (16) Each village in the chicken raising cooperative zone will designate one farmer to record a chicken raising diary for examination. The diary will be issued by the Bureau and will be rewarded appropriately. (17) A brief explanation of chicken breed improvement and its breeding methods will be compiled and distributed to cooperative farmers to guide its implementation. (18) The methods for promoting chicken raising cooperation will be planned after the two districts have achieved results. (19) Any matters not covered in these methods may be amended at any time</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Northern Faction Suddenly Buys 96 Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Rest Did Not Show Any Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese Securities Exchange did not see any improvement in trading. The market situation was slightly trending downward, but there were no major fluctuations. Observing the environment, events such as the increase of troops in North China and Germany's tough attitude towards France gave the impression of a city filled with wind and rain. Before the public bond reform, it will inevitably cause huge waves. Although the total number of chips in the market is increasing sharply compared to before, the amount of circulation in the market seems to be decreasing. This is entirely due to the fact that major players are not moving, and there is no opportunity for speculation. Therefore, although trading increased slightly yesterday, the market price has followed suit with slight shocks. On the surface, the only things that can be paid attention to are the selling of No. 16 and the buying of No. 10. In addition to the larger number of No. 96 bonds bought by No. 14, other brokers are mostly spectators. Even if there are entries and exits, the numbers are extremely small. Yesterday's experience: Because of the selling of No. 16, Class D suddenly decreased by 3 jiao and 5 fen. Most of No. 10 had some needs, and it returned to the top 5 fen and 1 jiao. Secondly, retail investors also exited more and entered less. No. 16 continued to sell off, and the trend was consistently weak. The world only decreased by 5 fen to 2 jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, and the popularity was still sluggish, continuing to weaken, falling another 1 jiao to 2 jiao or so. At the close, there were still sell-offs in No. 16, and morale became increasingly unstable, falling another 5 fen and 1 jiao and 2 jiao. However, the Northern Faction suddenly bought No. 96, and No. 10 ate in more comparatively, so the result was slightly better by 5 fen and 1 jiao. The rest all trended downward, mostly decreasing by 1 or 2 jiao or so. However, Class D decreased by 7 jiao and 5 fen, and forward contracts also decreased by 4 jiao. The total number of transactions was 3,095,000, of which Class C accounted for 1,120,000 and No. 96 accounted for 890,000. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>The French Government Will Ban Gold Exports</p>
<p>New York Stocks Suddenly Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (27th) the New York stock market rose and fell due to the weakness of the French franc.</p>
<p>There is a rumor that a large amount of French gold is flowing out, and the French government may ban gold exports. Bankers predict that the French franc will continue to fall. The recently soaring stocks fell by 2 yuan to 5 yuan or so. Other declines are limited. The situation is very dull, and there is no special pressure. Automobile, transportation, steel, railway, and public utility stocks all fell slightly. Aviation stocks fluctuated. Agricultural tool stocks were firm. Retail stocks were still stable. Small exchange stocks fell more. The bond market also declined slightly. The total number of transactions for the day was 155 high stocks. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Soar</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Market Is Firm, and Many First Settle Positions to Avoid Risks</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation is stable. The reason is that the overseas yarn and cotton situation is turning higher, and morale is slightly firm. However, the spot yarn transaction is dull, and various groups are still lifeless. Therefore, colleagues tend to sell off. However, raw cotton is expensive, and the cost of cotton yarn has increased, which has been absorbed by the financial community. Therefore, the players are particularly consolidated.</p>
<p>The Results of Standard Yarn Are All Rising</p>
<p>In the pre-market of standard yarn, each month jumped higher, and the opening prices all rose by 1 yuan to 8.9 jiao. The reason is that overseas yarn and cotton prices rose, and morale was firm. However, after the second market, it was heard that the spot yarn transaction still had no development prospects. By the time of the third closing, it had fallen back again. As a result, each month rose by 4, 6, and 9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month entered a sluggish path again, and since Monday would be the handling of the current month's delivery procedures, the market was closed, and general stable traders settled their positions in advance to avoid risks. Therefore, the transaction was quite clear. As a result, recent months fell by 5.7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and distant months rose by 2 jiao. It was found that Daji sold 300 bales, Minghua 450 bales, Taichang 700 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Changfeng 800 bales, Tonghe 750 bales, and Xincheng 450 bales. Jifeng bought 550 bales, Juxing 400 bales, Jinchang 400 bales, Shenji 1250 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, Yuanyi 650 bales, Dachangcheng 1500 bales, and Hexing 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Dull</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are clear and tired. It was found that various groups bought a total of 510 bales throughout the day. The selling price was firm. The buying amount of each group is as follows. Although there were sell-offs at high prices, the cotton results still rose.</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm. The reason is that the US and Indian cotton markets have unanimously turned upward. At the same time, the cotton stored in this port is decreasing day by day, and morale is rising. However, general cotton merchants are still selling off. However, the turnover accounts for April and May have expanded, reaching more than 440,000 dan. Distant months have returned to the 5 yuan mark.</p>
<p>The Cotton Aftermarket Turns Tight</p>
<p>In the pre-market of standard cotton, the opening price rose by 1 to 14 pounds due to the firm and active US cotton market and short covering. Indian cotton operators purchased, and the trend rose by 1 rupee and 25. Osaka Sampin cotton rose by 4.5 jiao. Market morale was still strong. Each month rose by 2 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. However, after entering the market, the yarn market was flat, and floating longs settled their positions. The market situation fell slightly. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The momentum of the market gradually tightened when the market opened in the afternoon. Juxing came to purchase again, saying that it was absorbing cotton for a certain bank. By the time of closing, Tongji continued to receive cotton in this month and was even firmer. Each month pierced through the 5 yuan mark. As a result, each month rose by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 1,900 dan, Minghua 2,000 dan, Tonghe 2,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,000 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, Shenji 2,100 dan, Yuanyi 1,700 dan, Yikang 2,100 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan. Juxing bought 6,900 dan, Shenji 1,800 dan, Dachangcheng 4,400 dan, Changfeng 2,200 dan, Yongchang 1,900 dan, and Runkang 1,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Selling Price Not</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is mediocre, and the factory's sales are stagnant, but the selling price has not . The sources of Yao cotton are 352 bales, and the sources of Tong cotton are 380 bales.</p>
<p>The Lineup of Longs and Shorts in Standard Cotton Expands</p>
<p>As of the 27th of this month, the number of long and short accounts for standard cotton in each month of the city's yarn and cloth exchange was checked. The turnover in April was 227,200 dan, the turnover in May was 214,900 dan, the turnover in June was 198,600 dan, the turnover in July was 166,500 dan, and the turnover in August was 124,800 dan. The total turnover was 932,000 dan. After deducting the long and short accounts, the disputed amount was 241,400 dan. It was found that there were 34 long parties and 24 short parties. The amount of the largest purchases and sales among them is excerpted below (unit: dan).</p>
<p>Selling Side</p>
<p>Buying Side</p>
<p>American Cotton Operators Buy July Deliveries</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Each month rose by 3 to 8 pounds. The buying interest in May was very strong. Everyone intended to sell off at the cotton hoarding location, and the market price may approach the spot price. Colleagues bought July deliveries, but the transaction was not large. In addition to profit-taking, there were also near-term and distant-term hedge settlements. Some foreign firms hedged and sold distant months. Later, colleagues bought old cotton and settled long positions in new cotton. As a result, spot goods rose by 13 pounds, old cotton rose by 13 and 4 pounds, and new cotton rose and fell by 1 and 2 pounds. British cotton spot goods rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 5 to 7 points. Hester estimates that factory use this week is 210,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory is 350,000 bales. Indian cotton speculators bought, and operators covered a large number of shorts. However, retail longs settled their positions. Pingguoer rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Xinmula rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 27th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 28th was 199 rupees, an increase of 2.25 rupees compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Sampin Yarn and Cotton are Firm and Expensive</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 28th: the price of Sampin futures yarn rose by 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 7 jiao. The recent month was 192 yuan and 3 jiao, and the distant month was 193 yuan and 6 jiao. The price of futures cotton rose by 3 jiao to 5 jiao. The recent month was 62 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen, and the distant month was 60 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.</p>

<p>Flour and Wheat Market Must Look at Wheat Harvest</p>
<p>The flour market opened yesterday morning, and the prices in each month were near-term and distant-term increases. The quotation for foreign wheat: Chicago near-term decreased by 2 jiao, and distant-term decreased by 4 fen. Canada increased by 4 fen. Because this month is near delivery, there are few entries and exits for both parties. Starting from June, although buying interest is not very strong, the factories are watching and the industry outsiders are mostly long. Therefore, the bid price is stable, about 1 fen better than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the transaction was very clear. Recent months still had little ups and downs. Distant months had very low air pressure and there was fear of rain, so they were slightly better again. According to the current environment, the new wheat harvest must have a grasp, and morale will begin to be impulsive.</p>
<p>Wheat was still half-determined at first, followed by a slight vibration in flour , and the market rose by 2 or 3 fen by the time of the close. However, transactions were not strong, and the long and short sides mostly rejected each other. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions in each month were even more lonely, and there was very little change from the morning market. The reason is that the new wheat harvest is not certain, and the shorts are not , while the longs have high market values. Therefore, there are only a few fen of entry and exit. The spot wheat market is still old and hard. Shandong Yaowan is still 5 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, a total of 4,500 bales, which was handled by Fuxin alone.</p>
<p>In the overseas wheat market, there is rain in the dry areas, and the long side of the May contract has settled its positions.</p>
<p>Kexian Street Sales are More Active</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>River Rice Transactions are Also Normal</p>
<p>(Kexian) New shipments continue to arrive from Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places. Wenta rice has also arrived at the port, and the only outlet is Kexian Street, which is more active. Large hoarding households are unwilling to reduce prices and absorb more rice due to rumors in the market. Although there are one or two small hoarding households inquiring about Jiangxi machine rice, the amount is very small. Therefore, the decisions of each block are generally weak. Although the market situation is similar to the previous market, the situation is ultimately weak. If the conversion and reduction continue to decrease in the coming days, the market price may need to be repaired. A total of 3,220 bales of Gan rice, 450 bales of Tai rice, 181 bales of Han rice, and 300 bales of Anqing rice were opened throughout the day.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Bianfang Binchi, the market price remains stable. Yesterday, 300 bales of small twisted rice and 650 bales of Siamese broken rice were handled by Kexian Street. The price was similar to the previous market. However, the previously determined rice records will arrive at the port one after another in the coming days, so morale is also weak.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each group arrived at nearly 40 numbers (a total of more than 8,000 shi), of which most were thin rice. However, only the Tianjin group handled more than 2,000 bales of thin rice, so the market situation has been repaired by a few fen. As for thick early glutinous rice, because the seller shouted a high price for the arrived species, the market is moving but not . Therefore, although the price has increased by a few fen and jiao, the situation is normal. Duyangjian has brought up nearly one jiao, and the Yinbian yuan is flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each route under the river were more than 20 numbers. The market's appetite for white glutinous rice was normal, and the price increased by 7 or 8 fen. Early rice followed suit, increasing by 6 or 7 fen. The French route for thin rice was slightly weak, and the price was high and the goods were very tight. Zhongjue was flat and phlegmatic. The price of Kexianjian rose by 3 or 4 fen. The prices of all other rice were tight and stable.</p>
<p>Corn Flows Back to Bengbu</p>
<p>Originally, the Yantai Gang was Procuring in Bengbu</p>
<p>The sales market for corn (namely maize) is usually mediocre, and there are only outlets for livestock feed and Yantai, etc. Recently, Bengbu has come to handle it, and 4,500 bales have already been traded. Therefore, the market price has risen by 4 or 5 jiao compared to the lowest price. This kind of backflow situation is rare in recent years. It turns out that the Yantai Gang is also exploring the procurement in Bengbu. The supply of rations is insufficient, and the market price is rising day by day. Yesterday, more than 400 bales of Chongming corn were continuously traded, and the price was 3 yuan 6 jiao 8 to 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>Benmian White Lower Grades are Very Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to show a weak image due to the few transactions. The guild drew up the market. The spot price of No. 24 raw brown sugar was 22 yuan and 5 fen, and the re-export price was 7 yuan, with no changes and no transactions. The eastern red (MS) mark was 15 yuan and 8 jiao. The spot price of No. 4 eastern white sugar was 22 yuan and 5 fen, and the re-export price was slightly 5 fen, which was 7 yuan and 5 fen. The spot price of No. 8 was 21 yuan and 7 jiao, with no ups and downs, and the re-export price was also slightly 5 fen, which was 6 yuan and 7 jiao. The spot price of No. 9 was 21 yuan and a half, and the re-export price was 6 yuan and a half. Benchang cotton white continued to decrease by 1 jiao, and the lower grades were weaker. The price of Zhenji No. 1 was 20 yuan and 6 jiao, No. 2 was 20 yuan and 3 jiao, No. 3 was 20 yuan, No. 4 was 19 yuan and 7 jiao, and No. 5 was 19 yuan and 4 jiao. The market trend of number goods like Min and Guangdong gangs is difficult to revive without continued openings.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<p>Hainan Longan Inventory Will Be Exhausted</p>
<p>Hainan longan was previously sluggish in sales, and the line market once saw . However, recently, no more goods have arrived, and the number goods in the market have finally been exhausted. The current inventory is also very small, and there will be a stockout soon. Therefore, Du Yuan is difficult to . However, longan has been reversing and tightening.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth Market Has Both Rises and Falls</p>
<p>Yesterday's transaction was not weak, and the prices of goods had both rises and falls. This was due to the smoothness of the blue sales, the amount of arrivals and storage, and the cost of the goods. The market inventory of flannel was lacking, the cost of new goods was expensive, and the number of outings increased greatly in the hot weather, so the price increased. Medium and thick were weak due to the arrival of Japanese goods and Yihuo. Hailingpeng also decreased due to Qiahe. Hua Yang cloth and Faxi lining saw an increase, and raincoat cloth and Su Biji all decreased. Hailis Holm's four volumes turned flat due to the weather. Light gray checkered thin woolen cloth, regardless of Chinese clothing or Western clothing, was consistently firm. Walter's gray decreased, and Yuanchang's yellow three colors increased.</p>
<p>One Year of Finance (7) He Boxiong</p>
<p>From January to October of last year, the outflow of silver was 2,863,973 gold units, and the inflow was 9,663,136 gold units, with a net import of 6,797,163 gold units. Calculated at 1 yuan and 9 jiao per Customs Gold Unit (before the implementation of the new bill on November 3, the Customs Gold Unit was maintained at around 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 9 fen), the silver import was more than 128 million yuan. In 1934, silver was in surplus for all months except January, which was entirely due to the US silver policy. In 1935, silver was in surplus only in May, which was due to smugglers privately exporting it. Other months were in deficit, which was due to the equalization committee purchasing more than 2 million yuan from Hong Kong in January and more than 1 million yuan in total from Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Nanjing in February. In April, the government announced three measures to encourage foreign silver imports on February 19. Therefore, the amount transported from foreign countries in that month accounted for 4.16 million yuan, including 2.92 million yuan transported from London and 1.24 million yuan transported from Hong Kong. Since May, except for July, September, and October, there has been no silver export to foreign countries. There have been continuous imports, most of which were purchased from abroad with gold in exchange for silver, not due to trade surpluses. The following is a table of silver imports and exports in 1935 for reference: Note 11)</p>

<p>7. Issuance of Banknotes and Clearing House</p>
<p>In recent years, the amount of banknotes issued by Chinese banks has increased quite rapidly. The total amount issued by the Central Bank of Shanghai, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the four reserve banks, Sze Ming Bank, Bank of Commerce, Reclamation Bank, and China Agricultural and Industrial Bank was only 279,552,000 yuan at the end of 1932. It increased to 342,963,000 yuan at the end of 1933 and 410,193,000 yuan at the end of 1934. As of the end of November last year, the total amount issued by Chinese banks in Shanghai reached a huge 556,181,841 yuan (see table below). The reasons for the sharp increase in the</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Public Concession's Position on Aviation Donations: Authorities Do Not Obstruct <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>But Compulsory Extortion Must Be Stopped</p>
<p>Regarding recent newspaper reports that the Concession authorities are obstructing the collection of aviation donations within the Concession, the Public Concession's spokesman stated that the Public Concession authorities have never opposed the collection of aviation donations within the Concession from beginning to end. However, since the start of aviation donations in the automobile industry last spring, the police authorities, having received numerous passenger complaints, stipulated that all aviation donations must be voluntary and no compulsory donations should be made. Subsequently, dance halls, taverns, and hotels successively started holding such activities. The Public Concession authorities have consistently adhered to this principle, allowing customers to donate as they pleased. The purpose is to maintain commerce and avoid disputes. However, as time went on, problems arose. For example, in dance halls, some self-proclaimed aviation association representatives were stationed at the entrances, requiring immediate payment upon entry. Or, in restaurants and pubs, a certain percentage was added to the cost of food and drinks as an aviation donation. Some hotels also engaged in compulsory collection of aviation donations. The police authorities have received repeated reports protesting this practice, and after dispatching detectives to investigate and confirming the facts, these various forms of compulsory extortion were deemed unacceptable as voluntary donations and had to be stopped. However, the Public Concession has not yet taken any drastic measures, nor has it imposed any fines. As for the Aviation Association, the Public Concession's Municipal Council, as early as June of last year, repeatedly communicated the principle of voluntary donations and has consistently emphasized this point in previous announcements regarding this matter, with absolutely no opposition. The concern is that this matter is of great importance and has a wide scope, and the Aviation Association may not be able to manage it effectively, leading to potential abuses. The Concession authorities sincerely hope that the Aviation Association can self-correct in the future, taking into account the previously agreed-upon principle of no compulsion. If the aviation donation is indeed a spontaneous patriotic act by Chinese citizens, they will surely donate enthusiastically, and the future benefits will depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Japanese Residents Advocate Reorganization of the Current Structure of the Municipal Council <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Our correspondent reports from this city through the foreign press. The second day of the regular meeting of the Japanese Residents' Association in this city was held on the 27th. The meeting started at 7:00 PM in the classroom of the Central Japanese Elementary School. Someone immediately raised an emergency motion regarding the current organization and election law of the Municipal Council, and the atmosphere was quite tense. The proposer's reasoning was that, given the events that occurred during this Municipal Council election, they hope for a fundamental reform of the current organization and election method of the Municipal Council, and that the method be completely entrusted to the chief of the residents' group. The motion was approved by the entire body. Afterwards, the budget案 was also approved, and the meeting adjourned at 11:30 PM. (Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Another report from this city states that according to news from various sources in the Public Concession yesterday, the order from the Shanghai Consular Body to re-elect the directors of the Municipal Council may not be necessary after all. According to sources from the Japanese side, the Japanese have secured a face-saving victory by declaring the election invalid. However, they are not confident in future election competition and are therefore willing to compromise. There are two possible ways to compromise: to demand that the qualifications of those elected on March 23rd and 24th be maintained. However, this would clearly violate the order of the Consular Body and contradict their previous demands, so the Japanese will not pursue this option. Instead, they will adopt the second method. What is the second method? It is that when the second round of re-election is held on April 20th and 21st, the Japanese residents will only put forward two candidates. In this case, there will only be nine candidates, which coincides with the number of foreign directors on the board. Therefore, there will be no need to hold an election. As for the British and American residents, they have different attitudes towards the election on April 20th and 21st. According to Major Basse, chairman of the American Voters' Association, he is very optimistic about the upcoming re-election and believes that it is a good opportunity to clear up misunderstandings with the Japanese residents. However, according to Basse's statements to others, the upcoming election may be resolved through mediation and may not actually take place. According to Colonel White, chairman of the British Voters' Association, he knows nothing about this incident and claims to be completely baffled. He also only saw the order from the Consular Body in the newspapers. According to him, the election on April 20th and 21st will probably not take place. (French Shanghai Daily)</p>

<p>If the telephone company does not accept, users may proceed as they see fit.</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee yesterday issued a notice to telephone users in various districts, stating: "Gentlemen, since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented the new charging system on the first of this month, all industries have felt constrained and the market has been sluggish. Despite repeated appeals from various circles to rescind the new system, the company has refused to comply, resulting in a stalemate. It is feared that without practical action, a satisfactory solution will be difficult to achieve in the short term. The Committee held its fifth meeting of the Board of Directors on the [blank]th and discussed the payment method for this month. It was decided that whether it is the basic charge or the number of calls exceeding the limit, a flat rate of 3 cents per call will be paid. If the company does not accept this, users may proceed as they see fit. Accordingly, the company will mail out the telephone bills for this month in due course. Users can calculate the amount due based on 3 cents per call. If the company refuses to accept this payment, users may act in accordance with the Committee's resolution. This matter is of great importance, and we urge all users to comply in order to achieve final victory. This notice is hereby issued for your information."</p>
