<h3 id="c17">英日關係的動態 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>在數年以前一般研究國際問題者有一個共通的觀察以爲英美的對立是帝國主義的基本的對立反資本主義的政論家作如是觀資本主義的政論家亦作如是觀</p>
<p>這一情勢顯然有着新的轉變了近一二年來英日的對立關係似乎比英美的對立更來得嚴重了遠東利害的矛盾南太平洋（包括暹羅馬來半島荷屬東印度新西蘭）日本經濟勢力的飛躍英日在印度澳洲的棉毛業市塲的衝突日本商品向近東諸國及英領菲洲殖民地的進出都顯示着英日商品市塲的對立形勢一天天地緊張起來在南北美洲方面英日在阿根廷巴西和英自治領加拿大的商業競爭也不斷地發展着日本的商品勢力不但伸入歐洲的英殖民地和自治領而且在北歐方面日本商品輸出的數量亦一天天增高在別的國家正憂愁着對外貿易萎縮的當兒日本却高唱着「貿易的景氣」「世界活躍的日本商品」</p>
<p>近年來英日的關係就在不平衡的狀態中進展着然而爲了過去傳統的友誼日本對英仍有戀戀不捨的餘情英國方面似乎也還想與日本協調由對遠東問題的妥協進到全亞洲全世界的妥協</p>
<p>事實證明了這是夢想海軍會議日本已宣吿退出了遠東英日合作日本已聲明反對了開放英國在東方市塲的條件已由日本公開提出認爲此乃保持英國在華北的實益進行英日直接折衝的先决條件了由這種種的事態英國不得不轉變態度單獨積極進行對華的策動</p>
<p>自從去年冬天以來英日在遠東金融的投資的商品的甚至政治的敵對關係都在嚴重的空氣中進展着這是不可吾認的事實而英蘇關係也就在此種情勢之下有着接近的趨向</p>
<p>英蘇關係的接近英國在遠東的積極的進出是廣田的東亞獨占外交過程中一個主要的難題『以遠東領土的廣闊關係的複雜日本欲完全控制將遇到無窮的困難』這是美國會議員波拉對遠東問題一句樂觀的話這句話足以說明遠東國際關係的實際</p>
<p>所以對英關係的如何調整是廣田所謂積極自主外交的機搆日本希望英國能够以尊重日本獨佔東亞的原則爲前提從事調整英日關係然而這是可能的嗎我們的回答是斷然的不可能除非跳梁的「赤禍」會危及英國在東方的基本勢力的時候</p>
<p>最近日方的通訊社儘量傳出英日進行妥協的消息同時又傳駐華英使賈德幹將於歸國途中訪日和日本當局舉行非正式英日會議交換遠東問題的意見這消息目前雖尙未充分證實但是今後日本對英政策的如何轉變却値得我們重視因爲它的影響不但及於中國而且是及於全世界的</p>

<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>（一）合作社的意義與種類</p>
<p>合作運動就是推行合作社制度的一個運動。但是什麼叫做合作社呢？簡單的說起來，合作社就是以平等互助的精神，自動的聯合若干人的力量，以改進此若干人的生活，並以改進整個社會經濟的一種組織。</p>
<p>假使拿合作社同一般的營業方法比較起來，那就可以說合作社有五個特質：</p>
<p>股權平等　普通的股份公司每以股東的股本爲本位，股份愈大者，其權力亦愈大，所以股東可以操縱一切。合作社就不是這樣，其權力的分配，乃以人爲本位；任何社員，不問其所繳股本之多少，皆以一票權爲限。</p>
<p>組織公開　一般以營業爲目的的公司，股本有一定數額，必須在此額內，纔可以買到牠的股票，加入爲股東。所以股票的價格，往往隨營業之盛衰爲轉移，假使營業發達，再要買牠的股票，就非出高價不可。合作社就不是這樣，其社員可隨時加人，股本亦無限額，所以地的股票，也不會　價。</p>
<p>限制股息　因爲股息是財產的所得，其中有許多不勞而獲的成分，所以合作社每定有股息的限制。普通的公司，雖然也有股息的規定，但往往比較的高。而且一般公司的贏餘，出是歸股東享受的，所以就是股息限制較低，也無甚意義。</p>
<p>退還贏餘　我在上面已經說過公司的贏餘是歸股東享受的，但合作社就不然，牠一年或半年結算的贏餘，從何處得來，就退還何處。因爲要這樣，纔可以得到價格的公平，避免相互的剝削。</p>
<p>社會目的　合作社爲謀社員的利益而組織，與公司之爲謀股東的利益而組織，似無二致。但合作社的股份很小，股權平等，組織公開，而贏餘的分配方法又不相同，所以實際上，與公司大不相同。公司以賺錢爲目的，而合作社則以謀社會利益爲目的。</p>
<p>以上爲合作社之意義，至其種類，則比較重要者爲生產合作社，利用合作社，購買合作社，運銷合作社，消費合作社，信用合作社，保險合作社等七種。茲將各種合作社之性質，分別說明於後。</p>
<p>生產合作社　生產就是創造或增加效用以滿足社會需要的行爲。所以聯合若干人的力量，根據合作意義以共同從事於效用的增加或創造者，就是生產合作。如農業方面之飼養種植加工等合作，工業方面之建築製造等合作是</p>
<p>利用合作社　由許多人聯合起來，共同購買，並共同利用，生產設備，如抽水機割稻機，播種機，運貨車等，以補個人財力的不足，並以謀使用的經濟者是。</p>
<p>購買合作社　共同購買生產用品，如種子原料肥料等，利用批發方法，以减低價格，减少雜費者是。</p>
<p>運銷合作社　生產完成以後，聯合若干人的產品共同運銷出去，以提高價格，减少費用者是，亦稱爲販賣合作社。</p>
<p>消費合作社　普通所謂消費合作社，每僅指消費用品的共同購買而言。我們常常所看到的消費合作社，或合作商店，即僅消費用品的購買合作社。實則消費行爲的合作，如合作食堂合作住宅等，更應該稱爲消費合作，所以前者，可謂爲廣義的消費合作，後者可謂爲狹義的消費合作。</p>
<p>信用合作社　個人的信用不够，聯合若干人的信用，以期達到目的者，就是信用合作。例如聯合二十人組織一借欵團，向銀行去借欵，各人擔負連帶責任，就是假使其中有一人無力還債，其餘各人均須負責代償，這也是信用合作的一種。有了這種連帶負責的保障，不但可以得到借欵而且還可以不必有抵押品，這不是很好嗎？但是眞正的信用合作社，應該還要能够吸收社員的存欵，使能以一部分社員所存之欵貸給需要借欵的社員，所以信用合作社，彷彿是一個具體而微的銀行。當然，銀行與信用合作社的贏餘分配方法是不同的。因爲銀行贏餘祇分給股東，而信用合作社的贏餘則除股息及公積金外，均攤還於存欵人及借欵人，這是因爲信用合作社的贏餘，就是從他們那邊來的。</p>
<p>保險合作社　保險事業在中國尚未發達，在外國則大的有一半的人均保有壽險，有很多的房屋，均保有火險。其所以要保險的原因，就是要想把少數人的危險，分配給許多人以减輕危險的負擔。因爲根據或利率或機遇率的意義，假使有許多人都去保險，决不會全體都遇着危險的。但保險公司係以營利爲目的，其所收保險費，每甚高；假使能够聯合許多的人，用合作方法，自己替自己保險，則所得利益相同，而保險費則可省去很多。况且保險公司不攤還贏餘，而合作社的贏餘，則可攤還，這也是保險合作社的優點。</p>
<p>（二）合作事業的重要</p>
<p>講到合作事業的重要，可以分三點來說明：</p>
<p>第一從經濟政策方面來講，經濟政策的目標，第一在求生產效率的增加，第二在求財富分配的公平。要想增加效率，有幾個條件：土地的改良，資本的累積，勞動的努力，組織的嚴密，是其中比較最重要的。從這幾個條件裏而，我們就可以看得出合作事業的重要。因爲上面所講的利用合作社，就是改良土地增加勞動效率的一種方法。此外如信用合作社，則可以幫助資本的累積，而且農民缺少組織的問題，有了合作社，也就解决了。</p>
<p>其次合作事業的發展，對於現實資產階級的利益當然是有妨害的。所以從整個的社會看起來，合作事業除增加生產效率以外，還有使財富分配更加公平的利益，這就使合作事業無疑的成了一種最完善的經濟政策。至合作事業之所以能增進社會財富分配的公平，有兩個關鍵：第一就是賣買的聯合，第二就是贏餘的攤還。這兩種辦法，可以使原來收入大多的减少，原來收人太少的加多，所以對於財富分配的關係是很大的。　（未完）</p>

<p>中國航空協會硏究部主任楊國柱君、昨應上海工部局華員俱樂部等團體之請在漢口路工部局衛生分處講堂、演講「民衆對於現代防空應有之準備」、聆講會員達四百人、演講歷一小時許、計分　航空在過去戰爭的地位、是怎樣、　現在航空器械的進步、是到了什麽程度、　上海市在未來世界大戰所處地位是怎樣、三節講述、所講均切中肯紫、其中允以第三節關於市民如何防禦空襲一點、通俗明曉、允爲人人應具之常識、用特摘要錄刋、以供參閱、所謂「市民防空」、就是市民本身防禦空襲應有如何準備之謂、防禦的方法、要可分爲六點、一、燈火統制、飛機襲擊都市時、首先必要的處置、是熄滅全市的燈火以消失敵機襲擊的目標關於燈火統制所要注意的不但是都市本身、即都市四週郊外村落也要注意、因爲假如都市四週村莊的燈火不熄滅仍舊可以使敵機判別出都市的所在、燈光統制的方法、是要根據飛行速度爲比例的、比如飛行速度一小時飛一八零英里、則敵機飛至九零英里時，即須在半小時內、將都市及四週村落全部燈火遮蔽、當一接到瞭望人的報告後、五分鐘內、須將街道上不必要的燈火减少、因爲都市中電火廣告的放光、在百里以外就可以看見、十分鐘後、凡門口以外的燈火須全行關熄、十五分鐘室內的燈火全須熄滅、或用黑布遮去光亮、因爲再有十五分鐘敵機就要到達、而且它在十五分鐘時、也就是當它飛至四五里的時候、它已經可以看見都市了、　烟幕、—現在都市建築、大都是水門汀、所以屋頂牆壁街道、都帶些灰白的顏色、在黑暗裏因爲反光的作用、即使沒有燈光映照、仍舊可以看得出、所以要避免敵機的目標、那還須加上一層烟幕、至施放烟幕量、須與空氣量差不多、因烟慕輕淡、等到揚散在空氣裏之後、仍然失却效用、但濃重亦足以阻礙交通、所以股好施放的烟幕量與空氣量相等、方向最好是順風施放、　地坑、—在未來的戰爭中、敵人空襲的目標、大都是集中都市方面、而都市的建築大都在十層左右、假如投下千磅的炸彈、那末在五零零密達週圍的高層建築、勢必倒塌、所以都市的遭受飛機的襲擊、比較地面要好得多、在地面下設立地坑就是都市民衆藏避的處所、地坑的建築、是以人口爲比例的、私人地坑、深度至少七英尺、地坑上面須築鋼骨掩護、以資安全、地坑出口、須築在屋外相當距離、以免爲磚瓦杜塞、公共地坑、在歐美國家、均築於公園或其他公共處所、現在法國已築有十六條地道、可由巴黎中心通至郊外、　消防、—都市建築的村料、大都可以燃燒、因此關係、敵機在轟炸都市時、還投燃燒彈、旣有了這燃燒的問題、消防就不得不格外注意、但防空時的消防、單靠平日市辦的消防隊、是無濟于事的、應由各界市民、預爲置備消防設備、及防救技術的訓練、戰時即可臨時分區組織、因戰時隨時隨地有發生燃繞的可能、消防隊要像平常那樣調動、顯然是不可能、並且都市水管埋藏的深度、並在五英尺以上、吾則水管一有受損、水源斷絕之後、則市民更陷于混亂、　防毒、毒瓦斯在歐戰時巳有、不過當時還是萌芽時期、可是現在毒瓦斯、製造的進步與猛烈、足使人聞而　駭、比如一盎斯量的毒瓦斯、散在五萬立方尺的地面上、凡是接觸到的人、均須死亡、照這樣說、假如用二噸的毒瓦斯、投在二六〇〇萬立方尺的上海、那末上海的全市民、可以說無一倖免、關于防禦方法、屋外須帶防毒面具、假如臨時會卒、可暫用潮濕面巾替代、因毒瓦斯所含酸性、遇水可以中和、但遇芥氣毒瓦斯、這辦法就補救不了、至于室內最要緊使門窗與外面空氣隔絕、隔絕的方法、窓戶可用厚質軟呢替代玻璃、出入必要的門口、應裝置蓮蓬頭放水、使毒氣不致內侵、不過這都是粗淺的講法、要安全除面具外、還須穿上防毒具、　隱避、通常的人、大都總是觀見了死機才逃避的、其實要曉得地面向天空看遠、不及居高臨下來得淸楚、大凡在六千尺以上飛行的飛機、在十一英里以外、已經看見人物、所以假如等到要看見飛機再逃、那已不及、要逃就應在聽到飛機聲音的時候、否則祗有伏着不動、萬一不得不逃、那末也祗好向飛機的左右方向逃、因爲飛機的飛行是直綫的、還有一點要注意、就是逃避飛機時、應當沿着街道的太陽照不到的一邊跑才對、</p>

<p>三，雜糧油餅業之商團組織</p>
<p>一，上海市雜糧油餅業同業公會該會簡稱雜糧公會，會址在新北門民國外路三一二號，創立於民國九年。初時組織，由荳米業中聲望者兼任該會董事，首任總董者爲葉惠鈞氏﹔另由客帮中推舉副總董及議董等。尋由會長制改爲委員制，現在主席委員亦爲顧聲一氏所兼任。成立迄今，雖僅有十三年之歷史，而爲後起中之勢力最宏大者。其介員以荳米行業爲基木，占全體會員半數以上。聞該會係民國九年前荳米業邊集客帮之茶會所遞嬗而成，常初現定由上海經營雜糧油荳餅之各帮華商公同設立，故原名上海華商雜糧油荳餅同業公會。內部分本客六帮。計七公所。茲列舉如决。</p>
<p>一　本帮商行　萃秀公所（荳業）</p>
<p>二　本帮商行　仁穀公所（米業）</p>
<p>三　漢帮（志成公所）此所謂漢帮，並非指旅滬漢口客商而言，而實際係專營漢口及長江上游與上海間雜糧荳米之商人，其中大半爲浙江寗波人。</p>
<p>鎭江帮　暨遠堂公所　該帮各商號資本雄厚，業務發達，除雜糧外，兼營南北糧雜貨，現亦爲雜糧公會之基本會員。但當時該帮尚未有正式團體設立，而附屬於志成公所者云。</p>
<p>四　廣帮　愼守公所　此係廣州旅滬糧商所組織，附屬於廣肇公所內。</p>
<p>五　潮州帮　潮州糖雜貨聯合會　此爲潮州旅滬商人所糾織，與愼守堂有別。該帮業務不限於雜糧一種，故即以糖雜貨聯合會名義加入。</p>
<p>六　福建帮　三山會館　亦稱福州帮，因由福州旅滬商人所組織。閩省人十經營商業之範圍亦廣，雜糧業爲三山會館中之一部份云。</p>
<p>七　厦門帮　泉漳會館　即爲厦門旅滬商人所組織，糧食一項，亦不過其中之一部份云民國十八年後，上海各業改組，該會亦因原名與荳米行業之荳子似有抵觸，故改稱上海市雜糧油餅業同業公會。初以各帮名義集合，以商號爲主體，故稱會員商號﹔近則不列帮別，祇列行號之代表人。惟其內容，則仍爲先前各帮，不過荳米兩業已告合併，鎭江帮巳獨立組織云。</p>
<p>專營或兼營雜糧油餅之行號，並不完全加入公食；即以客帮中之團體而論，尚有江西帮集益堂公所，天津帮順直會館等，並未加入。其他如汕頭，泉州，烟台，龍口，海州，靑島，營口，湖南，四川，大連，安徽等各省市客帮，亦未入會。洋商中專營雜糧米麥粉麩之進出口者，雖其中如英日等商行，亦具有絕大勢力，與華商往來甚繁，但均以洋行或個人名義交易，彼等自有商會等團體組織，故亦不加入華商團體者。</p>
<p>二，上海市雜糧零售　同業公會　此係零售雜糧之商店及一部經售掮客，共同組織。專售鬥市，不營批發，乃與米業之米號業同業公會相彷。該業範圍，較米店爲小，且多由米店兼營。創立於民國十年間，會員甚多，但甚散漫。會址在荳市街萃豐弄二號。現任主席委員爲孫繳雲氏。</p>
<p>三，上海糧雜油餅交易所經紀人公會　該會爲與麵粉交易所經紀人公會同種性質之組合，即係雜糧交易所中經紀人之團體。該所經紀人定額，爲一百人，較麵粉經紀人爲多；但實際上並未足額。雜糧交易所由荳米雜糧行家發起創立，經紀人亦多由荳米雜糧行家兼充，故其本身似較麵粉經紀人爲穩固。然業務不甚發達，近年來活動力遠不及麵粉經紀人。其現任正副主席委員爲傳昌裕薛成章二氏。雜糧油餅交易所之所員，練習生，所役，所工等，另有組織上海雜糧油餅交易所職工會。該會與麵粉交易所之同人會相似；但此則加入工役範圍較廣，經數度改組後，迄今尚存。其組織依照工會條例，故爲工會性質，而非商業組合云。</p>
<p>四，上海市油廠業同業公會　該會即油廠公會，由機器榨油各廠所組織。惟上海油廠寥寥無幾，出品組織，旣不及東北各廠之宏大嚴密，亦不如內地油車坊之繁多其製油原料爲大荳花核爲中餘如花生仁菜子等亦常採用。其中經營者分廣帮與浙江帮。市上常見之出品，如荳油，生油（花生油）淸油（花核油）以及荳餅，花餅，花生餅等，則大部爲立德，大有，大昌，　豐，大德新，生和隆及巨昌和等廠所出；而菜油與菜餅，則多爲內地車坊製造，滬廠並不注重；芝麻油則爲小磨坊所製，近來廠家亦漸注意及此。會址在江西路一〇五號，現任主席委員爲朱靜安氏。</p>

<p>—近遠期一律五元出關—</p>
<p>棉市大漲、且形勢異常堅挺、蓋以存棉不厚、金業商暨銀行界一致關閉大量現棉、三月期日商東棉洋行亦收進一萬多擔、近遠期棉一律上騰云、</p>
<p>標花收盤猛跳</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月上昇、因近月多頭有組織公司預備擠軋之說、故買鳳益熾、漲力尤强、愛記又來拖進、但美棉漲一至八磅音、印棉歐洲出口商賣出而跌〇·五至二羅比、然市場買戶踴躍、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三四·五角、午後開盤局勢極形鋒俏、籌碼殊枯、市傳有利多消息、通記繼續吸收、市價漲勢愈烈、迨至收盤遠月在跳三角、各月均漲出五元關外、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲二三·四·五角、查賣出協成一千六百擔、大孚三千五百擔、錦昌三千九百擔、森康二千五百擔、長豐二千七百擔、益康一千一百擔、瑞源一千三百擔、大豐一千六百擔、達記二千九百擔、元一一千七百擔、恒昌二千擔、買進益昶一千一百擔、潤康一千二百擔、合興二千四百擔、吉豐一千丸百擔、梅記二千六百擔、通記四千擔、賡豐叫千六百擔、生源二千擔、長和三千擔、裕大三千三百擔、明德二千三百擔、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉銷路略淸</p>
<p>現棉消費未能發表、廠胃亦呆滯、來源姚花六百包、</p>

<p>連疲四日之紗市、今則突吿上騰、實緣金融鬆懈、銀行界堅意吸收、上日三月期賣方交解之紗、多方悉數接受、同時原棉飛跳、致市盤漲風復熾、八月期重出二百十元關外、客銷如能繼續而來、前途當然看好也、</p>
<p>標紗市氣緊張</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月漲風漸起、以上日賣方雖交貨壓迫、然金融界悉數收受、市場人心又見轉機、賣者缺乏、市價緩步上昇、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲九角至一元一角、午後開盤、人氣仍緊張、檯面殊覺乾枯、蓋以合興父來大量抵補、市價邁步前進、實以棉市暴漲、致唇齒相依之紗市牽入佳境、結果各月比上午收盤續漲三·四·六角、查賣出德大六百五十包、大孚一千二百包、裕大五百包、達記二千零五十包、錦昌一千包、森康一千一百五十包、益昶四百五十包、永昌四百包、買進梅記一千五百包、合興四千三百包、愼記一千包、長豐一千四百包、恊成五百包、長餘七百包、生源一千零五十包、恒昌五百包、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現紗銷淸價漲</p>
<p>現紗銷路依然清淡、查全日各帮買去統計僅三百八十五包、行情漲一元光景、各帮買額如下、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌一二磅音、買賣雙方均集中於午刻、三月期最後價一角一分叫釐五毫、囤棉處最後供給之額、據估在萬包左右、餘月因多頭了結及套賣而軟、陳棉亦因外商賣出而疲、新棉則因同業及空戶買進、成交不多而堅、此後人心、將集中於五月、及囤棉處是否再拋、收盤堅挺、計現貨跌一磅音、期貨漲二至八磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨跌一二點、印棉散戶買進遇歐洲出口商賣出、計平果爾跌〇·二五至〇·五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·五至二羅比、白羅溪跌一羅比、原電錄左、（二十五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十六日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲一百九十六羅比、較上日收盤漲一羅比、</p>

<h3 id="c173">論胡中藻詩獄 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>我曾寫過一篇叫做文字獄的文章，裹面涉及胡中藻，以爲胡氏原是道地的奴才，决不會心存種族之見的。後來又見到一篇同題的文章，作者以爲胡中藻雖然沒有「民族色彩」，但他的詩却「頗有反淸的思想，而且嘲笑咒駡得很妙」，他舉了「淸風不識字，何事亂翻書」，「明朝展振翩，一舉去淸都」，「大明天子今朝見，且把壺（胡）兒擱半邊」等等的詩出來。</p>
<p>胡中藻的堅磨生詩鈔，現在恐怕找不到了吧，那裹面的事實如何，我們也就無從知道。不過從乾隆的上諭里，還可以看見那所摘的詩句。乾隆認爲大逆不道的，第一件便是那書名，說是：「堅磨出自魯論，孔子所稱磨湼，乃指佛胖而言，胡中藻以此自號，是誠何心！」至於那所摘的詩句，我現在姑且抄在下面，把乾隆認爲叛逆的理由，也的略說明了。</p>
<p>（一）「一世無日月」，「叉降一世夏秋冬」——乾隆的意思，以爲淸朝自從定鼎以來，承平熙皞，遠過漢唐宋明，而竟謂又降一世，這是沒有人心。</p>
<p>（二）「一把心腸論濁淸」——把濁字放在國號上。</p>
<p>（三）「天非開淸泰」，「斯文欲被蠻」，「相見請看都盎背，誰知生色屬裘人」——指其挑擬漢滿之見。</p>
<p>（四）「南斗送我南，北斗送我北，南北斗中間，不能一黍闊」，「再泛　湘朝北海，細看來歷是如何」，「擬雲揭北斗，怒窮生南風」，「暫歇南風競」——責其兩兩將南北分提。</p>
<p>（五）「周時穆天子，車馬走不停」，「武皇爲失傾城色」，「白雪高難和，單辭贊莫加」——因用詞用典，和詩題無涉，指其寓意訕謗。</p>
<p>（六）「老佛如今無病病，朝門聞說不開開」——造謠。</p>
<p>（七）「人間豈是無中氣」，「不爲游觀縱盜　」，「三才生後生今日」——詞意在悖。</p>
<p>（八）「天所照臨皆日月，地無道里計西東，諸公五岳諸侯瀆，一百年來類首同」，「周王　因時邁」——前者寓山河蒙羞的意思，後者用昭王南征事，意存訕謗。</p>
<p>（九）「亦天之子亦萊衣」，「如今亦是塗山會，玉帛相方十倍多」——三個亦字，「悖慢已極」。</p>
<p>（十）「靑蠅投　肯容辭」，「那是偏災今降雨，况如平日佛燃燈」——前一句譏聽信　言，後兩句譏不賑災禍。</p>
<p>（十一）「並花已覺單無蒂」，「其夫我父屬，妻皆母道之」，「女君君一體，焉得澳然爲」——這幾首詠孝賢皇后之喪，對於帝后，直斥曰其夫其妻，而且君父人之通稱，君比父尊，而胡詩以君比父，所以是喪心病在。</p>
<p>（十二）得免吾冠是出頭」，「一世璞誰完，吾身甑恐破」，「若能自主張，除是脫韁鎖」，「一世眩如鳥在笯」，「蝨官我會慚」，「天方省事應問我」，「世事於今怕捉風」，「瑣沙偷射蜮，饞食狼張箕」——這些都是怨悵之語。</p>
<p>以上所引的詩，是乾隆從胡中藻的堅磨生詩鈔里摘出來的，也就是胡中藻所以得到殺身之禍的悖逆的證據。不過據我看來，胡中藻不但沒有什麼種挨之見，連一點可以令人首肯的諷刺也沒有。他的那些詩句，有些是要賣弄才情，故意用幾個險韻，僻典，以及和題目不相連涉的竊兒；有些則是故作牢騷，好像自己的大才被埋沒了似的。至於「斯文欲被蠻」，「誰知生色屬裘人」幾句，我疑心那所指的是鄂昌，而且還是推崇的意思。</p>
<p>不然，胡中藻念念不忘於耶爾泰，天天和鄂昌輩相酬答，難道就忘記了他們也正是達子麽</p>
<p>至於某先生所舉出來的「淸風不識字，何事（得）亂翻齊」，是雍正朝里庶吉士徐駿做的。「明朝展（期）振翩，「舉去淸都」，「大明天子今朝（重相）見，且把壺兒擱半邊」，是徐述　一柱樓詩。一前一後，與胡中藻毫無關係。不知是吾父是誤記？</p>
<p>其實胡中藻的並無什麽種族之見，乾隆的肚里，也是昭然的。他所摘出的詩句，和所定的罪狀，都非常勉强，一望就知道是出於羅織。只有「記出西林第一門」那一句，才眞是乾隆寄恨的所在，這和他的幾决三番禁止大臣立黨的諭旨，是暗相合拍的。所以胡案審結具奏，乾隆的御批里，就撇開種族糾葛，只講門戶之見了。那里面：</p>
<p>「胡中藻依附師門，甘爲　犬，其詩中　舌靑蠅，據供實指張廷玉張熙二人，可見其鬥戶之見，牢不可破。即張廷玉之用人，亦未必不以鄂爾泰胡中藻輩爲匪類也。　爾泰張廷玉亦因遇皇考及朕之君，不能大有爲耳。不然，何事不可爲哉！大臣立朝，當以公忠體國爲心，若各存意見，則依附之小人，遂至妄爲揣摩，羣相附和，漸至判若水火，古來朋黨之弊，悉由於此。……」</p>
<p>依附師門，甘爲　犬，這才眞是胡中藻的罪狀，而也就是我所說的奴才們的末路。</p>
<p>淸朝的文字獄，有許多都有着絃外之音，例如查嗣庭的見殺於雍正，並非因爲出了「維民所止」的題目，割去了「雍正」兩字的頭，倒是因爲他原是隆科多的舊屬﹔沈德潛的見殺於乾隆，也不是因爲「奪朱非正色，異種亦稱王」的詠黑牡丹詩，而是因爲他把代替乾隆竄改或捉刀的詩一併收入了自己的集子，戳穿了西洋鏡的緣故。胡中藻的詩獄，不過這種情形里的一種而已。</p>
<h3 id="c174">江上桃花 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>也是這樣的一個寒冷的春天，而且不斷地下着雨，好容易後來晴了，但春天却隨着晴天的增加反比例地减少。閒話中大家可惜失去一個游春的機會。在南昌，每年的春三月，大家都粉紛地去三村看桃花的，而這時桃花該已謝了。我以一個異地人的見解，爭執着桃花不會落得這樣早，雖然甘蔗的生產，說服了我承認南昌的氣候比較早，但我仍勉强分辯這年的春寒或將造成不同的結果。其實大家原也希望這樣一個藉口的，但他們還是用着別一個理由，陪我同去。我久已想到贛江上去泛一决舟，大家都以爲這是不經見的荒唐舉動，不贊成，現在借看桃花去坐一段船，却是一合適的藉口，於是我們把看桃花改成游江出發</p>
<p>爲了可以有更長的水程，我們舍却通常去桃花的碼頭而出滕王閣。滕王閣是一點痕跡也不存在了，左近已成了上下貨物的要地。假定那一班惋惜古跡沈湮的讀古文觀止的風雅之士，竟會把滕王閣重建起來，不知道是會驚覺「落霞與孤鶩齊飛，秋水共長天一色」的風景總不可再見呢？抑或是能關起樓門，仍做他們的『遙吟俯暢，逸興遄飛』的迷夢。我們試一想在王勃當時，早就不能不作「蘭亭巳矣，梓澤邱墟。」的慨歎，他就不覺得閻伯嶼的盛會有什麼可以珍惜，後人又何必替他珍惜。再看百花洲是煥然一新了，但迄無方法改良東湖的一泓　水，究竟父有什麽意思。</p>
<p>我們打滕王閣上船的預算出乎意料地失敗，那兒竟沒有一條船，船都開去看桃花的碼頭趕生意去了。於是我們沿江重走向那裏去。在半路，就看到許多捧着桃花的歸人。知道這决的桃花是看定了。碼頭上亂嚷着，「去看桃花，每人一角上船就開」的喊聲，我們走上一條最就便的船，本以爲我們一共已有五個人，會立刻就開的，不想却要我們待着，一直到有十個人，這船夫仍是不開船，却向另一船夫商量把船客讓渡，由他坐收一半的渡費。我們知道上當了，出了較高的渡費倒也罷，但實在不甘心同時還做了商品，因之後上來的五人雖聽憑他的出賣走上別船，我們却固執地留在他船上，要他自己渡去。誰知我們這辦法却是自走人更深的圈套，我們又由商品而降爲廣告，由我們的已經在船，使後來者更誤會以爲今早開而陸續上來做了商品。這父一方式的利用眞弄得我們憤憤而無可奈何。我們自走下船去找別船，却沒有一人敢答應裝載。我們意會到這是潯陽江上遇張順了，但究竟不相信我信仍處在水滸時代，我們重回到原船前和船夫交涉，交涉實在是沒有效的，但我們一共五個人橫在他的船頭，斷了客人上他船去的路確使他領會到實際的損害。終於他不能不讓我們順利地叫着船，並且渡費只每人五分，暫時我們自信是把困難克服了。但也眞只是暫時，當船行了一截，船夫告訴我們吃虧的只是他後，我們依然留下一個嗒然。</p>
<p>船是返向北蕩，一直到滕王閣口，繞過閣對面的沙洲，再轉入夾江重折向南。沙洲上也有疏落的人家，有一家就在洲的極北端的尖角上，這洲角兩面都有石堤的遺蹟，但已破落得不成形像。我以爲這上面或曾有過偉大的建築，因問同行道是不是潮王洲，——那滕王閣原來所在的潮王洲——同行的人回答不出洲的名字，但知道潮王洲楚在夾江之外的。那末潮王洲之外再有江嗎？道又沒有人答得出，因此沒有得着結果，連所去的三村是在什麽地位，也始終沒有弄淸楚。看花去的船都泊在一個地方，但上岸後却又要沿江走三四里路才看見有零落花樹的村莊。問地名就已是三村了，但再前進再問，沿路的村莊，却也以同樣的名稱回答。直到走到一已不見茶棚踪跡的村落，才被告訴那裹已是六村。據村人說，實際桃花最好的是七村八村。話大概是有些可信的，因爲確有些游人向更遠的路上走，不過我們却走上歸路，在的略估計可以算是三村的地方坐下。</p>
<p>實在無論那一段都還是楊柳多於桃花，無論田岸邊，池塘上，墳塍頭，都不缺少柳樹，桃花則都在人家院落內。桃樹並不比柳樹難長，不知道爲什麽人不願意隨地種，也不知是否種在外邊的不易保留。看花人都觀喜帶點花回去，如有野花可折，大槪不花錢去買的。花價有相當的貴，很少折好向游人兜售的。多的只是楊柳編成，綴着些花朶的花籃。要買整枝的花，須找鄕人臨時向樹上折，但游客找定一枝，鄕人往往並不肯賣。據一個同伴的意見，那大概是那一枝可以生產價値遠高的桃子，倒並不是想借以抬高價格，這想法到從茶攤老人那裏得到一側而的證明。據他說，往年桃花一季的生意是很好的，賣茶一季有十餘兀的收人，花也賣得十元左右，現在茶的生意不好，就希望桃子上可以找點補償了。他不想到花時的情形不好，果季的情形也是不能怎樣樂觀的。</p>
<p>這一天的游人還不算少，在我異地人雖覺不感到什麽興趣，但同伴中也時時引入以游人作話題的談話。在他們所認識的游人中，有一部份是出賣靑春婦女，這在看桃花時看到自然是容易引起人的聯想的，當然父歸入輕薄桃花那一套結論。於是逐漸自然說到春天的應該結束，桃花的應該凋謝。誰像鄕下人的關心桃樹的果實呢，多數人只等待第二個春天。</p>
<h3 id="c175">兩種人 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>披丁一肩的灰沙和一顆悽愴的心進了站台。</p>
<p>三點三十五分要開的南下的藍鋼車已經停在那里，白的烟雲和煤味散出來，嘶嘶轟轟的音響敲着旅行人的慌張和惆悵，火車頭胃着冲天的雲翳，發着叫人心顚的怪叫。</p>
<p>月台上塞滿了人聲，數不淸的脚步在來回地蹦跳，箱籠和包裹在手臂下挾着，紅背心的人正在這一刻爲了麵包了該說是爲了榛子麵和窩頭吧？—喘着氣，路警踏着勻整的步子在巡逡。</p>
<p>爲了嚐够了送行的滋味，自己也扯了個謊哄過了朋友們的問詢，便獨自個挾了簡單的行　偷兒般地從古城溜走了，沒有一聲嘆息—不，嘆息也許是在心底。</p>
<p>大喇叭是已經在播昔了，宏　的調子重復　中一遍洋一遍地報告着，人更慌忙了，叫囂漫透了雲天。</p>
<p>好容易跨進了一節三等車箱，孤獨的旅客被一些奇異的眼光盯着：怎麽的呢，沒一個友伴送行？</p>
<p>忘却了這個，轉着　子地巡迥，看有沒有空座。</p>
<p>差一點叫人失望，人都把一些包裏佔住了一條能容三個或兩個的長椅，走長路的把毯子全鋪好了，把兩隻脚橫伸着，閒散的神情告訴人家：免開尊口。</p>
<p>我放下提箱，準備守到天津，到了那兒該有不少旅客下車的。</p>
<p>「喂，俺這兒空！」</p>
<p>被這像是熟悉的「喂」嚇住了，左邊有一隻手在　背上輕輕　了一下。</p>
<p>一張誠撲的臉，小眼睛里透着溫和，秃秃的腦袋還發靑，　然是新剃了的﹔一件藍布大褂畢挺地罩着棉袍，比比自己的道件四季一色的藍外皮，不禁臉紅了。我側過身子打了個招呼。</p>
<p>小眼睛的角梢擠到了一堆去，竟是那般羞怯的。這是只有北方的稍帶土氣的年輕人特有的忠誠。</p>
<p>問淸了我是耍過兩夜時，這位伙伴把自已的衣包移到對面的位子上去，向那個位子上的他的同伴輕輕嘰咕了幾句後轉過頭來：</p>
<p>「坐這兒吧，兩夜的火車够受，這長凳將就點能睡的了。我們到德州的，夜里十二點便下車。」他的山東口音把「德」字念成「　　」，我感到親切，一向我是很少聽山東口音的。</p>
<p>「坐到我道兒來好了，現在我還不必躺下。」我瞥見他那同伴的厭嫌的眼光了，他嫌道少年人多事，使他不得不把伸直了的脚屈過去。</p>
<p>然而年靑人搖搖頭，好像不慣和一個女孩子坐一張長椅似的，竟低下頭來扭着一隻白蓬布的錢袋，把繩子在手指上繞着圈玩。</p>
<p>「這是個終年坐櫃台的夥計，」我估計定了。</p>
<p>他們的談話澄明了我的猜想是對的。</p>
<p>那位同伴點上了雪茄烟。</p>
<p>是個精鍊的老行家呢，已經是二月的乍暖天氣，還是皮袍套了皮襖，車里漸漸熱起來，道肥胖的商家剝了外衣，年靑的伙伴給拉着袖，那一偭竟是不在意地讓他折疊，像是在理似的。</p>
<p>「你到了德州還趕早路麼？」坐下來，胖商家聊起天來了，趕情他們也才是剛剛熟悉了的</p>
<p>一談到家，年靑人舐着下唇，瞇着細細的眸子：「還有五十里地呢，騎牲口。」</p>
<p>「不是有了公共汽車？快得多！」</p>
<p>「快得多，唔，」眼睛躱着胖子嘴里吐出來的烟雲，「可是就得四五毛，僱個牲口，一包子兒就挺足了。（註：一包干兒是一百枚，合北方洋價兩毛光景。）</p>
<p>又像是不願意胖子的冷淡似的，年靑人還在興緻濃烈地唸道：</p>
<p>「更有一層，公共汽車有班决，等之前非吃一頓飯不可，騎驢子隨時都有，省得上飯館了。這一下子又省四五毛。哎，四年沒吃家裏的飯了—」</p>
<p>沉鬱和眼前就要來到的歡慰夾雜地撞着年靑人的心田，一時竟含笑着說不下去了，又舐着下唇。</p>
<p>「啊喝，四年！俺一個月打一决來回，辦貨也眞辛苦哪，爲了點臭錢，就只好這樣「遮騰」（北平土話，即往來奔波。）可是近來茶葉買賣倒還可以，人再怎麽窮，茶可是不會不喝—」不禁得意得搖起屈着的右腿來了，年靑人的背上馬上是一個泥印，却不在乎地回過手去撩了一下，接着話頭：</p>
<p>「一年準能撈個一兩萬了？我們南貨鋪里去年賺了近萬，可是，關我們X夥計鳥事……」瘦臉父紅了，這一次的舐下唇是勾起了無限憤慨，「最好也不過年底拿個十塊八塊的，望不出頭呢。」</p>
<p>「慢慢來，俺當初也是用了千把塊錢作起的，你支多少薪？早滿徒了？」</p>
<p>「去年才滿的，這才支——」禿腦袋微微搖着：「六隻大洋一個月！沒有本錢是沒辦法，家里連年水大，西瓜種不好。『家里的』還要我給點錢她。」——說到女人，年靑人羞了，也許還是睽隔了四年的半陌生新婦呢。</p>
<p>天暗下來，過天津，肉包子的喊聲充滿了窗口，瘦臉捧起了一堆包子，讓着同伴，胖子雖說已叫了一份蛋炒飯，但也領情了一個，嘴里直說沒帶零錢，短襖口袋里抽出一疊鈔票，隨後又塞了進去。</p>
<p>胖商家獨自個啖着舖着火腿星的蛋炒飯，是那樣安閒自滿的神情：</p>
<p>「倒還有味……」</p>
<p>賣報的呼喊打斷了他的讚美，拿着份新聞報向蛋炒飯的碟子邊伸時，胖子點點頭，脚碰一碰藍布袍的腰：</p>
<p>「喂，勞駕，我沒零錢。」</p>
<p>年靑人謹愼地解開了那隻繞得很緊的白蓬布口袋，溫和地付了十　大枚。</p>
<p>隨着燈光的來臨，車里靜下來，旅客們拋棄了窗外的黑暗，儘自打起鼾來，年輕人有點乏了，靠在椅背上閉着眼，手里揑好了錢袋和繫在背上的藏着車票的手絹，樸質的臉子顯得更溫和，那溫和是蓋住了成了習慣的順從與屈服。他作着夢，夢到了家園，夢到了妻兒，夢到了壓榨和破敗……</p>
<p>不然，又爲什麼在鼾聲中一會兒微笑一會兒蹙眉呢？我不敢動彈，怕在他眉際浮起了一絲歡慰時而驚醒了他，下了車他還得騎牲口趕路呢！</p>
<p>也不知在什麽時候車又站住了，猛可的煞車驚醒了自己，對面椅上的兩位已站了起來，瘦子在替胖子站上去取下皮箱，酒瓶，鏡框……他自己只有一僩布袋，一隻藤包。</p>
<p>「哎，蛋飯的錢還沒付，你還有零錢？」</p>
<p>瘦子有點躊躇地應着，終於又給了胖子一個滿意的回答，解開鈕子從內衣中掏出一方捲得緊緊的小包，荷葉捲似的裹了好幾重，里面是有限的幾張鈔票，整齊地折着。他從當中檢出了三張單角的角票。</p>
<p>收碟子人點點頭，從胖子手里接過了錢。</p>
<p>「對不起呢，用你的錢。」</p>
<p>「那里話，咱是老鄕，老鄕！」少年人婉和地笑着。</p>
<p>我目送這位夥伴下車，他挾了箱籠的影子在月臺的午夜的燈光中消失了。</p>
<p>一個月了，這禿頭和細眼還在人心上幌，願生活踢去了他的順從及他的屈服，綿羊是只能叫人宰割的。</p>

<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>人到了沒有理想可以追求的時候，那心情底破碎，大概可仿之於爆炸的電燈炮——眼前的光明消失了，黑暗下祗賸些拌脚的碎片。</p>
<p>這就呌我老記着那一天下午的事情。</p>
<p>因爲訪友不遇，我和老天在打浦橋那帶閒踱。踱過了橋頭，兩人皆想喝幾杯酒，藉以冲淡心頭的無聊。我們就找上臨斜徐路的一家酒坊。</p>
<p>那酒坊是兩開間門面的。右面放着一張角尺形櫃頭，一面臨街。左面靠牆疊上些酒罎子，全是些沾泥的蒼老的士罎，彷彿剛從地窖裏取出，呌人一看到馬上會想起陳年花雕的味道。直出臨階那塊，放着張刻字的小桌，有人正坐在那裏低頭刻字。</p>
<p>我們在靠櫃頭的一張桌旁坐下了。</p>
<p>店主用極其科學的方法，把一根銅管子打入罎子的泥頭裏，去吸取罎子裏的酒，但他把這黃酒拿來的時候，却還浮着一隻溺斃的蠅屍。</p>
<p>我們喝着酒，剝着花生米，雜談着一切。日子是無聊的。過去的足跡，全沒些可以紀念的。未來的安排，我們全沒有計算。我們談着現在，現在的一刻；我們父默默地低頭到酒杯口去，照着自己臉貌。一等到相互瞧住時，嘴角都浮起些乾苦的微笑。酒也慢慢兒乾了！</p>
<p>正在再要上一斤花雕的時候，從街頭踱來一個羅宋　三。人總可以想象得出他的容貌吧。馬鬃似的乾苦的黃頭髮，醬紅色的虛腫的臉，一統滿沾油膩或泥土灰沙的黑破的西服，照例的拖着一雙卓別林式的破皮鞋——這爲紀念他們一手造成的人間的地獄而不願進那別人爲他們建設起來的天國里去的忠烈的義士，終於拐着脚走向這里來了。他站在臨街的櫃頭前，爲了生活的需要，他捨却他應有的貴族的語言却用殖民地世界市場的上海的話，指着櫃上一隻黑色酒罎子說：</p>
<p>「迭個—一百錢！」</p>
<p>於是他就從西服的口袋里，淘金似的抓出一把跟灰沙相混着的角子票來，碌着碧眼極嚴肅地往屋子里四處瞧着。</p>
<p>主人極其熟習的，正和招待這條路上的苦力船夫似的爲他酌上了兩杯白乾。我回頭跟老天說：</p>
<p>「也許是將軍呢？」</p>
<p>老天點着頭，喝上一杯酒。——然而默然了。</p>
<p>「羅宋　三！羅宋　三！」突然從左面送來了一個呌聲。我回頭瞧去，那個彷彿給誰的大手掌一個勁兒撩住再也抬不起頭來的刻字匠，這回却以報復似的心情，他眼角拖出鯽魚尾似的笑痕，對這也許是個將軍出身的義士招呼着。</p>
<p>「哈事體？」他把櫃上的酒接了過去，一杯一口的彷彿喝淡開水似的眉都不縐地喝了，然後吐了些唾沫子，這麼的說。</p>
<p>「比比看！比比看！」那刻字匠說着，霍的笑了出來。</p>
<p>「好呀！比呀！比呀！」他說着，就把西裝褲鈕解開，拉出了一條他們本想藉以維持貴族的血統而今竟流亡無所垂頭喪氣的小東西，他一手拿住，上下地搖動着：一手則指一會刻字匠，指一會那東西，彷彿因此發洩了某種欠缺似的罵了出來：「娘賣民的！——好呀！來比呀！娘賣民的！」</p>
<p>於是掌櫃的娘子和那刻字匠都哄然大笑了﹔而我却全身如潑過了冷水惶然地看着彷彿在烟酒的味道中咀嚼人生的老天底惘然的臉。</p>
<p>「娘賣民的！娘賣　的！」他還不住的咕嚕着，吐着無聊的口沫子，慢慢地把褲口鎖上來，踅蹩着走了。而店堂內的勝利似的笑聲，却像乾裂的竹片似的繼續了好一會。</p>
<p>我瞧着他的後影，我想：像這樣的在別人的奚落中彷彿感到滿足的英雄，是吾還記得他那曾經以自己的淫樂而浪費別人的汗血的歷史的事實？是吾還記得以鞭子與槍彈戲弄別人的生命，以自己的喜笑抹殺別人的存在的千古壯舉？——然而，在這樣一個大時代里，作爲一個小入物，蹀蹼街頭，浮塵似的隨着足跟旋轉，處處顯示自己的無力與軟弱，那麼在他的身上，也許有我們的影子吧！</p>

<h3 id="c178">華僑的慘劇 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>所謂「華僑」這兩字，在一般人眼中，一向是帶有黃金的光芒的。若干人只看到少數在海外「得發」了的「華僑鉅子」，帶了大批的金子銀子，回到本國來，顯赫非凡，於是捐欵啦，爲祖國振興實業啦，以至「祖國福星」啦等等的一大堆頌詞與贊美，就像雨點一般的向這班闊華僑身上密集過去。闊華僑在若干人眼中成了一尊救苦救難的財神菩薩。金錢頓時換得了無限的「崇拜」。可是在這極少數闊華僑之外，更有多數的窮苦華僑，這些窮苦的華僑們，他們所身受的貧窮摻痛與悲慘的壓迫，這些在只崇拜闊華僑的人的眼中，是難以找到一些些極炎薄的印象的。每外大多數被壓迫華僑的參苦呼聲，從來不曾震動過祖國只知崇拜闊華僑人們的耳鼓。其實，此刻已「得發」了的若干闊華僑，大半可說也是從從前的千難萬難中掙扎而得到今日的地位。當他還深陷在貧窮慘痛的深淵中時，人們一樣也誰都不去睬到他。但到他「得發」了時，他在視國人眼中，便頓時換了全部人生，他頓時從貧窮無告的地位而變成了萬人崇拜的偶像。這是因爲他身上已已發出了黃金的光芒。</p>
<p>這幾天本報連載着關於閩粵一帶已回了國的窮苦華僑，重被騙運赴南洋一帶，又被迫回國的悲慘劇。這些窮苦華僑，本在海外，因近年南洋一帶經濟慘落，又兼當地帝國主義政府壓迫日甚一日，於是無法謀生，不得不陸續被迫退回本國來，可是本國農村日趨崩毀，一樣也無立足之地，於是若干閩粵一帶的輪船公司人們，便異想天開，誑騙他們說，南洋經濟已日有起色，當地政府對華僑的待遇也已大大改善，這正是重行前去的絕好機會，他們信以爲眞，便典質借貸，勉强凑足了路資，交給輪船公司被「包運」前去，藏身三層艙底，和貨物被裝在一起，中途有被悶死的，於船回香港時拋入海中。到得南洋時，却被當地政府發覺，悉數扣留，驅逐回國。此時他們錢已用光，眞是「上天無路，入地無門」。現在滯留在南洋進退不得者尚有四五百人之多。報紙所載如此。他們和爲祖國若干人所崇拜的闊華僑一樣，同樣也是所謂「華僑」，但所得的結果是這麽相反。若干崇拜闊華僑的人們，此刻誰又有工夫去理睬到這班進退無告的窮華僑們呢！</p>
<h3 id="c179">祖父 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>祖父是一個天才工藝家和雕刻家。可是他一生的命運都給安排在貧窮的輪齒下，浮世的安榮幸福，從來沒有落到他身上；艱難的日子裏，咬緊牙根，掮起生活的担子，嘆息着希冀着：看着春來春去，花落花開國汗流盡了，血榨枯了，歲月給了他一個殘酷的裁判，他老了！他已不能在衰老的殘軀上再榨出自己的汗血供生活吮吸，這寂寞的衰颯的暮年裏，他只得帶着一個悲凉的心境，每天，不聲不饗的伏在一隻小檯子上，細摩細琢地發揮着他的天才，尋求一點精神上的安慰。</p>
<p>房子裏長是那麽冷淸，空傖，從來沒有透出過一聲娛怳的呵呵的歡笑，或是閒話桑蔴的對談。每天，從太陽出山到落山，祖父自家一個人傴僂着背，走進來又走出去，枯皺無光彩的臉上，老是蓋着一層衰鬱的神色，坐下來，不說一句話，架起老花眼鏡，手裏的小刀嚙着一隻盤根錯節的木頭，剔瑟剔瑟的，像一一隻小老鼠咬着堅硬的食物，發出細碎的聲響。臨了，幽幽地嘆一口悶氣，抬頭注視一會蹲在簷階下挖泥沙的兩個小孩兒，隨站起來向吊在壁間的一隻竹籃子裏檢出兩塊糕餅，慈和地喊。「來，阿英阿乍，看好門吓，公公出去就來的。」我和姊姊都滿足地笑了。</p>
<p>祖母走進房間裏，看擺滿檯子的小刀小鋸，木頭木屑，常常就嘮嘮叨叨的給祖父丟過一陳諷嘲。祖父有時耐不住也氣忿忿的給祖母回一句。「你懂得什麼！」又不響了，隨放下手裏的小刀旋轉身面着祖母，兩人談起家常來，沒有把握地計算着南洋的水客幾時會到，叔父也許寄錢來了吧？碰到這個時候，我總覺得房子裏要惹起什麼禍事來那麽似的，再也不敢望一下吊在壁間的那隻竹籃子，悄悄拉拉姊姊的衣角溜出門外。</p>
<p>一年兩年，歲月是悠長不盡的，祖父的背似乎更傴僂起來，頦下的長鬚也更變得長變得白了。同時他的小檯子上也就多了好幾件很精巧的小擺設，祖母的諷嘲也來得更多。可是，祖父似乎幷不以此滿足，每天還是從太陽出山到落山，不聲不嚮的伏在小檯子上細摩細琢消磨他寂寞的些月，他似乎要這麽樣不斷創製，無間工作，纔能够得到心境的慰藉，精神的寄托。</p>
<p>一天，祖父又完竣了他的一件供祭的菓盆，那種細雕精刻的花卉，典麗奪目的貼金圖案，鮮艷的硃漆，都極其調和圓熟的構成這件菓盆精緻不纎，典麗不俗的外表。祖父眞滿意極了，他覺得他己獲到無上的榮耀，以往的勞作，耗費的心血，到此都有了完滿的代價。他讓　的小刀小鋸休息了好幾天。</p>
<p>又一天，祖父忽然帶了這件菜盒出去，回來時菜盒就不見帶回，只看他神色非常沮喪，從衣袖裏檢出兩長包銀毫來坐在檯子邊發楞。那天我和姊姊也就沒有吃到他的糕餅。從那天起，祖父又不聲不嚮的伏在檯子上細摩細琢…………</p>
<h3 id="c180">牧羊老人 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>他住在這山坡下已經五十多年了，這五十多年中，他只是靠着牧羊孤獨地生活着。他像是一般時人詩里和畫家畫中的那一種老人，在這山坡下寂寞地存在着：從幼到壯，從壯至老，他沒有離開過那山坡，也沒去做過別的買賣，始終是在這山中牧羊。每天他趦趄地走上了山坡，在一叢大楡樹林傍停了下來，那些羔羊便散了隊伍，在那灰黃的枯草堆里去搜尋牠們所需要的食糧。他自家却就跑到高處一個墓前的斷碣上坐了下來，悠閒地抽着旱烟。</p>
<p>侵晨的鷄籠山在濃厚的朝霧里隱蔽着，天空是陰鬱得有點可憎，沉重的空氣浸透在凝固的靜寂中，使人連呼吸都會感受到壓迫。灰黯的雲片是糊得更緊了，氣候也比他起身時寒冷，山　里的松濤已在澎湃着；他穿着那件硬而且破的靑布大褂，委實有點傲耐不住了。他兀自坐在那兒哆嗦着，兩條淸水鼻涕爬在那灰黃的鬍髭上，他移開了旱烟管，伸起了那隻顫抖的手，用袖口在嘴邊擦了一下，接着噴了一口烟：</p>
<p>「又要下雪了呵」！他把那枝三尺長的，又當赶羊竹竿，又當拐杖的旱烟管在地上一撑，趁勢站了起來，凝視着天空，嘆息似的說。</p>
<p>他最怕是遇到卞雪下雨天，因爲在這些天氣里他就不能放羊羣出門，可是關牠們一天，就耍一担桑葉乾。</p>
<p>羊羣是他的伴侶，也是他的生活。從前最多的時候，他一個人曾經牧放過</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>二百頭乳羊，白天就在這鷄籠山的週圍放牧，有時他也會拉開了那隻沙喉嚨哼起牧歌來，並且每天還要刈兩蔀草乾。因爲那時候羊毛每斤要買到一角幾分，剪毛和羊皮都很値錢，所以他也就很平穩地生活着。雖然孤獨，雖然辛苦，可是他只刻版的工作着，機械地生活着。他自安在那平凡的環境里，沒有憧憬也沒有哀愁地把日子一天一天地打發過去。可是現在，他看了一百頭羊子還不滿，况且近來毛羊又不値錢，六七分洋錢一斤還沒有人要買，就是羊皮和剪毛也很賤了；因此，他的生活也由平穩而變了不安定。</p>
<p>他把羊羣赶上了山麓，仍舊讓牠們自己去各自尋食，他却躱在一個避風的石巌下去抽烟了。他一口一口的吸着，儘把那淡藍色的烟頭吐在面前，讓它給風吹散。他彷彿要藉這烟的力量去烘暖他的肚子，烘暖他的全身。望着那羊羣，一隻隻地在樹林中，在枯草里徘徊着，那呌聲是散播在這山麓的週遭。</p>
<p>從遠處送來了一串鷄啼聲，他知道己中午快了，於是探手到胸脯頭去摸出了幾隻乾饝饝；但饝饝雖然是硬，爲窩在胸脯頭的緣故，所以倒還有點溫暖，而　那一種蕎麥麵的香氣却很誘人的鑽進了他的鼻竅。他就檢起了一個饝饝送到脫光了門牙的嘴里去細細地啃着，啃着。但是勉强吃完了兩隻，那牙床肉己經疼痛得不能够再咬了。</p>
<p>羊子們很活潑地在山麓里躍着，呌着，他瞇了一對老花的眼睛，看着那八十多頭羊子；他想：這些羊子中間有一半多點是有胎羊婆，但是那些雄羊頭總要賣出去才好，將來一交春就沒有人要的。</p>
<p>現在己經冬盡春回的時候了，可是他三四十頭雄羊還沒賣掉一隻，然而小羊倒要產生快了。</p>
<h3 id="c181">牧羊女 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 祝康</p>
<p>牧羊女拜達諾勒金，把身子匍在蕯頓科河畔的草原上，手　着小草，細聲細氣的唱着杜爾伯特人的情歌。</p>
<p>頭上是四月里的太陽，懶洋洋的撒着嬌笑。克興額烏罕平原舖着平坦無邊大的綠氈，靜穩的像一個酣睡的少女似的，倒臥在溫柔和暖的陽光里。胡桐樹的紫花噴着香味，飄過河岸，漸漸地在空氣中隱藏起來。解除了覊絆的薩頓科河悠游自得的汨流着，從魯賽端山麓蜿蜓的向南伸開去，給克興額烏罕平原鑲上一條無盡頭的長帶。天空，草原，河流，沙灘，……整個的宇宙都閃耀着鮮明的誘人的色調，把這粗暴的世界弄得馴馴服服。</p>
<p>潺潺的流水劃破了平原的靜寂，遠處近處的牲口羣，雜色的石塊似的散堆在草地上；柔嫩嬌綠的草壞，塗着各色的斑點，彷彿宮闈的華麗的地毯似的。羊，頑皮的觸着角。又懶又蠢的老牛，伏倒在草地上晒陽光，閉着眼不時哧着鼻子。遠山中的獵槍一響，馬就驚悸的豎起耳朶。魯賽端山巔的輕淡的薄雲也愉快的在浮動着。</p>
<p>拜達諾勒金被陽光撫摸得昏昏欲睡，眼皮髮澀身子疲倦得要變成癰癱。歌聲早在她口中停斷了。她慢慢地爬起來，揉了揉眼便朝着魯賽端山發楞，身邊的老黃狗搖着尾巴，兩眼溜豎豎的瞅着主人的神情。拜達諾勒金顯然是在幻想着什麽？最後她跑到羊羣兜了一個圈子，又跑過來，依身在胡桐樹幹上，痴呆呆的沉思着：忽而眉頭皺起，忽而笑紋滿面，這自然是以往的回憶在挑撥她的神思。（未完）</p>

<p>國民社電美國加州聖約翰，大羣飛燕，復於今日飛抵此間，六十八年以來，燕羣抵此之日，竟不爽累黍，每年必於三月十九日飛來，十月二十三日飛去，雖屬閏年，亦輒弗誤，譚老三日，想必燕子亦有日曆，所以去來如此之準，三月十九可稱爲「燕來」日，十月二十三可稱爲「燕去」日，凡人之違背新生活運動，而不遵守時間者，請看看飛燕，</p>
<p>美國水災損失，現在估計，不下五萬萬元，華盛頓因波吐瑪克河水勢稍落，似可脫險，但防範辦法，迄未稍懈，白宮四周，悉是沙袋，景象頓異尋常，譚老三曰，美國雖稱金元國，若照我國星相卜起來，必定說，有財有水，大吉大利，</p>

<p>嚇得糊裏糊塗的娜拉聽得門鈴聲，强打精神的去開了門。</p>
<p>進來的是南陔醫生。</p>
<p>南陔痛苦地吿訴他的生命的賬將要破產了。——恐怕不到一個月就要埋在墳裏爛起來了。——等得到那確實的壞消息，他送一張畫着黑十字的名片給娜拉。</p>
<p>娜拉帶着憐惜的心，請他看看她的脚，也許他看看旁的地方。此外，她還向陔要一種和他們要好的大證據，請他幹一件很難很難的事情。南陔聽了非常高興，他情不自禁的說：「娜拉，你以爲世界上的人祇有他肯——甘心替你死嗎？我把你愛得和——」</p>
<p>正在談話的時候，女僕愛蘭拿了柯樂克的名片進來遞給娜拉，使她脫脫地驚喊起來。</p>

<p>— 末名</p>
<p>接到讀者「末者」的一封信，他告訴我五年以前的一個故事之外，還附寄着一段稿子，就是下面發表的。我似乎也記得五年之前梁小姐是住在寳山路商務印書館隔壁，梁小姐也曾坐過姓陳的破汽車，「舊情人」姑且不談，「並不認識」似乎很像一個笑話。編者</p>
<p>「哈特」跑上南京進中央攝影塲，爲了在上海站不住脚」。</p>
<p>可是「哈特」在「戰士」裏，終於給抬起來了。</p>
<p>本報二十四日刋出他的一張半裸小照，幷且在旁邊加注了一段說明：「中央攝影場的「戰士」將公映了，梁　珠的舊情人「哈特」是主角之一……」不料第二天梁小姐來個電話聲明：「並不認識」。</p>
<p>「舊情人」姑且不談，可是對於認識與「並不認識」之間，倒　一個値得提出的問題。</p>
<p>記得「哈特」認識梁小姐，確確實實是有這麼回事，介紹人原是雙方的朋友，是一位姓陳的，（那時候梁小姐沒有像眼前住沁園邨那樣子舒服，）然而現在姓陳的已經死掉，梁小姐大槪做了紅舞星後，就容易「健忘」的緣故，所以就來個電話聲明「並不認識」，而對於我們「站立在旁觀者」的人忍不住走出來證明一下了。</p>
<p>希望梁小姐想一些兒五年以前的事情吧？</p>

The original telegram is excerpted below: "Our army attacked and captured Shuitouzhen, and then took advantage of the victory to attack key points such as Jiaokou and Shikou. All of these were captured on the 24th. According to captured bandits, Mao Zedong fled west with over five hundred bandits upon seeing that the key points could not be held. They were intercepted by our army midway, and over three hundred bandits were killed. Mao Zedong, his wife, and the pseudo-political director Yang Shangkun barely escaped. Wang Dingwen, the leader of the bandits' pseudo-finance committee, has been captured and executed after interrogation. In addition to ordering the troops to suppress bandits in separate divisions, this is specially telegraphed. Yan Jing (25th) Reference." (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing. According to Taiyuan news, after the Shanxi army retook Shuitouzhen, it has now occupied Shilou. It is heard that Mao Zedong escaped with his wife before the Shanxi army entered the city, thus avoiding capture. However, the pseudo-finance minister Wang Dingwen (transliteration) has been arrested and is now being sent to Taiyuan. Five hundred bandits were killed in the battle between the Communist bandits and the Shanxi army in Shuitouzhen and Shilou. It is heard that the Communist bandits are currently active in northern Shanxi. Communist bandits were discovered in Baotou on March 24th and were driven away. It seems that their purpose is to destroy the Ping-Sui Railway. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

He has issued a proclamation to all military personnel and civilians, urging them to strictly prevent and expel the bandits. Those who have gone astray will be allowed to surrender and will be exempt from prosecution. Those who remain obdurate will be severely punished. He has also instructed the garrisons and county magistrates in various locations to conduct searches and suppress the bandits at any time. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Recently, Reuters and various newspapers have reported news of banditry in Shanxi Province, with rumors of the fall of Linfen and Hongdong. The British and American embassies, due to the large number of British and American missionaries in the area, have repeatedly requested rescue from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the Shanxi Provincial Government to inquire and request rescue. According to responsible officials, the reports from Reuters are not true. Our side has dispatched heavy troops to Lingshi and the areas south of it, and the bandits have been defeated and are being cleared. It can be guaranteed that there is no danger. Due to transportation reasons, passenger tickets on the Tongpu Railway south of Lingshi have been temporarily suspended. The above news may have originated from this rumor. The Shanxi Provincial Government also replied in a telegram stating that the bandits between Linfen and Hongdong have been ordered by military commanders to be swiftly attacked by the northern and southern armies and that the siege can be lifted soon. Furthermore, the bandit army has no siege equipment, and the city defenses are tight, so there is no danger. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Ma Yinchu Discusses China's Foreign Trade <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing. Ma Yinchu said that China's trade surplus or deficit is currently statistically based on customs' imports and exports, which is insufficient to estimate the increase or decrease of national wealth and cannot be used as an accurate calculation. The customs statistics only cover imports and exports of goods. Currently, in terms of imported goods, smuggling and tax evasion are happening, and before strict anti-smuggling measures are in place, it is clear that the statistics are not accurate. As for exports, customs officials tend to underestimate the value. For example, if the value of each package of silk is one thousand taels, it is often estimated at six hundred taels. However, this is not due to merchants trying to reduce taxes and lowering the assessed price. Even for tax-exempt export goods, customs estimates are also underestimated. This has been a long-standing custom of customs over the years. Someone once asked customs officials the reason, but they could not answer and could only call it a custom. Due to these two factors, the overall amount of imported goods should naturally be higher than the current figures, and the number of exported goods should also naturally be higher than the current figures. In addition, the profits earned by Chinese residing in various countries and remitted back to China are exports in the form of labor, and the proceeds are returned to the country. This remittance is also a trade surplus for the country. Furthermore, when Chinese students take money to study abroad, it should be listed as a trade deficit. In addition, the expenses of foreigners in China and the missionary and military expenses of various countries in China are indirectly China's trade surplus. The scope of this type of statistics is very broad. If it can be fairly and accurately determined, it can prove the amount of outflow from China and the amount of inflow from each country. Only then can we statistically determine whether the national wealth increases or decreases each year. In my observation, China's overall statistics at present may not necessarily show a decrease in national wealth each year. It is heard that the Bank of China is conducting this investigation, and if it is successful, it will be a great achievement. Ma also said that France is a country with a trade surplus and can have surplus funds each year. However, countries with a trade surplus often invest their annual surplus funds abroad. Our surplus is others' deficit. The more our surplus, the greater others' deficit. In the future, as others' purchasing power decreases, we will no longer be able to have a surplus. In recent years, France's trade surplus, in addition to investing abroad, still has surplus funds. Therefore, hoarding gold is useless and will prevent the money from generating income. Therefore, a meticulous plan must be made after having a trade surplus. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Kunming. According to a telegram from Zhenkang, after the Sino-British Boundary Commission inspected the southwest watershed in Mengdong, the members of both sides separated. The British members, due to obstruction by the Ye Kamin, detoured through Yan Shuai inland north of the watershed. Our members believed that, as no Chinese had traveled through the Shaoxing Damanhai area, for the future of boundary affairs, they were determined to take a risk and go that route to clarify the truth. The neutral members also wished to accompany our side, so they proceeded from Mengdong over Antunba on the 14th. Unexpectedly, when they reached Shancha, the Kamin there, who had always been in cahoots with the bandits in Yonghe and Yan Shuai, obstructed the route with weapons and opened fire on our side. The escort team engaged them in a fierce battle for several hours before the Ye Kamin retreated. That night, our personnel retreated to Youduo, resolving that the Ye Kamin would attack in the morning. Our members, for the sake of self-defense, ordered a counterattack, and after a fierce battle of half a day, they leveled the various villages of Daogang and Nuo. After this punishment, the Kamin were fearful and requested to surrender. On the 18th, the neutral members and our members safely arrived at Laba in Lancang County, east of the watershed north of Damanhai, and met with the British commission.

<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Several years ago, international affairs analysts shared a common observation that the conflict between the United Kingdom and the United States was the fundamental conflict of imperialism. Anti-capitalist political commentators viewed it that way, and so did capitalist political commentators.</p>
<p>This situation has undergone a significant change. In the past year or two, the conflict between the United Kingdom and Japan seems to have become more serious than the conflict between the United Kingdom and the United States. The contradiction of interests in the Far East, the South Pacific (including Siam, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, and New Zealand), the rapid growth of Japanese economic power, and the conflict between the United Kingdom and Japan in the cotton and wool industries in India and Australia all indicate that the opposition between the United Kingdom and Japan in the commodity market is becoming increasingly tense. In the Americas, the commercial competition between the United Kingdom and Japan in Argentina, Brazil, and the British dominion of Canada is also constantly developing. Japanese commodity power is not only extending into the United Kingdom's European colonies and dominions, but also the volume of Japanese commodity exports in Northern Europe is increasing day by day. While other countries are worrying about the shrinking of foreign trade, Japan is boasting about "trade prosperity" and "Japanese commodities active in the world."</p>
<p>In recent years, Anglo-Japanese relations have progressed in an unbalanced state. However, due to the traditional friendship of the past, Japan still has lingering feelings for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom also seems to want to coordinate with Japan, progressing from a compromise on Far Eastern issues to a compromise on the entire Asia and the world.</p>
<p>Facts have proven that this is a dream. Japan has announced its withdrawal from the naval conference. Japan has declared its opposition to Anglo-Japanese cooperation. Japan has publicly proposed conditions for opening up the United Kingdom's market in the East, considering this to be a prerequisite for maintaining the United Kingdom's practical benefits in North China and conducting direct negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan. Due to these various events, the United Kingdom has had to change its attitude and actively promote its policies towards China independently.</p>
<p>Since last winter, the UK-Japan relationship, in terms of financial investment, trade, and even politics, has been progressing under a serious atmosphere. This is an undeniable fact, and the rapprochement between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union is occurring under this circumstance.</p>
<p>The rapprochement between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom's active advancement in the Far East are major challenges in Hirota's diplomatic process of East Asian monopolization. "With the vastness and complexity of the Far Eastern territories, Japan will encounter infinite difficulties if it wants to completely control it." This is an optimistic remark made by U.S. Senator Borah on the Far East issue. This statement is sufficient to explain the reality of international relations in the Far East.</p>
<p>Therefore, how to adjust relations with the United Kingdom is the mechanism of Hirota's so-called proactive and independent diplomacy. Japan hopes that the United Kingdom can engage in adjusting Anglo-Japanese relations on the premise of respecting Japan's principle of monopolizing East Asia. However, is this possible? Our answer is definitely impossible, unless the "red menace" would endanger the United Kingdom's fundamental power in the East.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese news agencies have been trying their best to spread news of a compromise being reached between the United Kingdom and Japan. At the same time, they are also spreading news that British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will visit Japan on his way home and hold informal Anglo-Japanese meetings with Japanese authorities to exchange views on the Far East issue. Although this news has not yet been fully confirmed, how Japan's policy toward the United Kingdom will change in the future is worth our attention because its influence will not only affect China but also the entire world.</p>

<p>Both Sides Opened Fire for Several Hours</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Abandoned Two Corpses and Retreat</p>
<p>Moscow, Today, Around 10:00 AM, Borike time, seven armed Japanese soldiers, in the Huichun area near the borders of the Soviet Union, Manchuria, and Korea, crossed from Manchuria into Soviet territory, penetrating 250 meters inside the border. They opened fire on a Soviet patrol team (comprised of five border guards) 300 meters from the border.  The two sides clashed for half an hour, resulting in the Japanese troops being forced to retreat, abandoning the corpses of one Japanese officer and one soldier within Soviet territory. At 3:50 PM, 50 to 60 Japanese soldiers crossed the border again, carrying several light and heavy machine guns, and invaded 250 meters from the same area near the No. 8 boundary marker, occupying the high ground. They fired rifles and machine guns at Soviet border guards and a distant outpost. The border guards fought back valiantly, and the Japanese troops were forced to retreat back into Manchurian territory in the evening. Both sides suffered casualties. According to TASS news, Moscow received a report of the Japanese invasion of the Soviet border, and the Soviet Ambassador to Tokyo immediately protested to the Japanese government, demanding a strict investigation into the actions of the Japanese military authorities, punishment of those responsible, and reserving the Soviet Union's right to claim compensation for losses. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The Ministry of the Army announced that at 9:00 AM on March 25th, in the territory of "Manchukuo" four li southeast of Huichun, near Changlingzi on the Russo-Manchurian border, nine Japanese soldiers, including officers, were reconnoitering the terrain when Russian soldiers suddenly opened fire illegally.  The Japanese troops, for self-defense, immediately returned fire but, fearing an escalation of the situation, retreated 1,000 meters. However, the Russian troops continued to fire, relentlessly pursuing and attacking, causing several Japanese soldiers, including officers, to be wounded. The Japanese army urgently dispatched several dozen troops as reinforcements. This unit, together with the border guards, remained on alert. At 4:40 PM, the Russian troops resumed heavy fire with a strong force, and the Japanese and Manchurian troops had no choice but to return fire. The fighting ceased at night, and the Russian troops retreated north of Changlingzi. The Japanese troops also withdrew from the front lines, concentrating in the rear. Two Japanese officers, one non-commissioned officer, and five soldiers, as well as three Manchurian soldiers, were wounded. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

The Foreign Ministry authorities released the following information regarding the content of the meeting: Foreign Minister Hirota received a detailed report from local officials regarding the Changlingzi incident on the morning of the 26th. He immediately telegraphed Ambassador Ota in the Soviet Union, instructing him to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet government. At 3:00 PM on the same day, he met with Soviet Ambassador Yurenev at the Prime Minister's residence, stating that the Soviet border patrol had opened fire on Japanese officers who were observing near the border without any other intention, without issuing any prior warning. Such reckless behavior should be seriously protested, and the Soviet side should promptly eliminate the atmosphere of unrest in the area. (Domei dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Minister of the Army Terauchi Explains Inside Story of Tokyo Incident <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Many Parties Responded After the Incident</p>
<p>Fortunately, Authorities Dealt With it in Time to Prevent Escalation</p>
<p>Efforts to Prevent Undermining of People's Military Service Obligations</p>
<p>Tokyo, At a meeting of local governors at 1:00 PM on the 26th, Minister of the Army Terauchi explained the details of the February 26th incident as follows:</p>
<p>Slander against the military and anti-military movements, now accompanied by ominous events carried out by a few officers colluding with external extremist elements, are a violation of the duties of soldiers, disrupting military discipline, and leaving a stain on the glorious history of the nation. Such behavior cannot be tolerated, and the responsibility must be borne by the entire military. There are those who falsely accuse the military, claiming there are still many bad elements within, and even spreading rumors that this incident had the tacit understanding of some military leaders. Such people are intentionally damaging the reputation of the military, causing its authority to be lost, and plotting the separation of the military and the people through anti-national, anti-military movements. We sincerely hope to prevent such anti-military movements early and achieve unity between the military and the people.</p>
<p>The relationship between the incident and external forces; the scope of the current incident is not limited to the military, but seems to have reached various levels outside the military, with a considerable number of people involved. These people colluded with a section of people within the military, leading to the incident. Furthermore, after the incident, there were many who acted rashly in response. Fortunately, the authorities dealt with it promptly, preventing its escalation. In the future, we must eliminate these bad elements and eradicate the root of the disaster. The road ahead is long, and I hope everyone will continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Crack down on strange documents; recently, there has been a significant increase in strange documents, which is very regrettable. The occurrence of the current incident, and the social unrest after it, are undoubtedly directly related to these strange documents. For the benefit of protecting the country and the national army, thoroughly cracking down on strange documents is an urgent matter at present.</p>
<p>Prevent the undermining of the public's sense of military service obligation; in the current incident, the general soldiers who obeyed the orders of their superiors and joined the rebel army are truly pitiful, and the military, which failed to prevent it beforehand, also bears significant responsibility. These soldiers are currently being tried by the judicial authorities, and the determination of responsibility for those who fundamentally obeyed orders will be clarified with a cautious attitude, so as not to leave trouble for the future. If the current incident leads to an undermining of the sense of military service obligation, or a decrease in the number of people supporting the military, then the national defense will be truly worrying.

<p>To Convey Purge Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo, In light of the internal and external situation, Minister of the Army Terauchi, not allowing any delay in implementing the military purge, has set the meeting of all army commanders and division commanders for the 7th of next month to communicate the purge policy thoroughly as scheduled. Furthermore, at the meeting of local governors on the 26th, personnel were dispatched to explain the truth of the February 26th incident and the basis of the military purge, hoping for the assistance of local officials and civilians. After the urgent problems within and outside the army that need to be resolved come to a conclusion, the Minister of the Army will, with a significant resolution, investigate the social, economic, and political causes of the February 26th incident, tracing back to its roots and eradicating the causes of the disaster. After Generals Umezu, Nishio, and Isoya assume their positions, the Minister of the Army will convene a meeting of the army leadership to discuss specific policies. (Domei dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>President of the Academy of Fine Arts Presides Over Ceremony</p>
<p>Paris, The exhibition of ancient Chinese tapestries and carpets opened today at the French National Gobelins Tapestry Factory, presided over by the Minister of Education, Gnou, and the President of the Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition showcased a dazzling array of works from the 6th to 19th centuries, inspiring sighs of wonder. According to the Director of the Factory, Marnier, speaking to our reporter, "For two years, we have collected tapestries and carpets from various countries in the Near East, as well as from the Peruvian, Egyptian, and Coptic peoples of America, and held separate exhibitions. This time, we will collect extensively from various countries in the Far East, particularly China, tapestries, kesi, and wool and silk carpets from the 10th century onwards to study their development. This will surely be welcomed by those generally concerned with Chinese art. We are also honored that the National Louvre Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and History in Brussels, Belgium, the Guimet Museum, and many collectors in France and abroad, particularly Mr. Villonet of Lausanne (known at the time for his research on Chinese symbolism and ancient Far Eastern textiles), have generously lent their treasured masterpieces for display, adding much luster. What is displayed this time are primarily ancient Chinese kesi masterpieces, whose ingenuity is breathtaking and worthy of admiration, and which are all able to preserve the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation. This is in harmony with the Gothic tapestries hanging in ancient French churches. There are also Japanese "Nishiki tapestries," which are also exquisitely beautiful, on par with Chinese kesi. As for modern Chinese silk tapestries imitating the ancients, their production techniques are comparable to 'kesi.' In addition, there are also Chinese embroidery, Tibetan textiles, and Chinese carpets, among which Chinese carpets were only introduced to France in the mid-19th century, so our research on them is not yet very thorough. As for the arrangement of this exhibition, it is arranged sequentially according to the system and age of various products for easy viewing," he said. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">British and Japanese Silk Industry Competition <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>London, The British and Irish Silk Weaving Industry Association held its spring banquet here last night, where President Farrell delivered a speech, warning about the competition from Japanese silk products in the British market. He said that if the government does not raise tariffs on Japanese goods in a timely manner, the threat to the British silk weaving industry will inevitably be impossible to eliminate, and also said, "The government should pay attention to the production of certain items within the country that are originally necessities for national defense at all times. Therefore, in the event of war, the government must reorganize various industries, and the silk weaving industry is actually in an important position. However, if various government departments continue to order Japanese goods, then the national defense plan will inevitably be impossible to complete. The Association has previously strongly advocated that when King Edward VIII holds his coronation ceremony in the future, all silk products used should be domestic goods as much as possible. In addition, Sir Joseph, president of the Federation of Industries, also delivered a speech, saying that Japan's exports are increasing daily, and its means of competing with British goods are unscrupulous, such as imitating the styles of British goods and counterfeiting British trademarks.

<p>Warsaw, German trains passing through the Polish Corridor are in debt, which has not yet been paid off (totalling approximately 185,000,000 francs).  Therefore, the Polish government, starting from February 7th of this year, ordered the suspension of all trains to Berlin. The two countries immediately entered into negotiations to find a solution. The German government has recently instructed its ambassador to Poland, Moltke, to handle the case with full authority. After receiving the order, Moltke immediately visited Polish Prime Minister Gutschelkowski to discuss the matter. According to the semi-official Berlin German News Agency, an agreement is expected to be reached soon. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Pacific Defense Augmentation Issue - Britain, America, and Japan Conduct Negotiations</p>
<p>London, The new Anglo-American-French London Naval Treaty was formally signed at the naval conference at St. James's Palace this afternoon. Signatories included American representatives Davis and Stanley, French representatives Corbin and Robert, and British representatives Eden and Monsell. Representatives of the British Empire's self-governing dominions and India, with the exception of South Phi and the South Irish Free State, also signed in place of the soon-to-expire Washington Treaty, effective from December 31st for a period of six years. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London, British representative Eden and American representative Davis exchanged letters after the signing, containing the agreement reached during the talks between the British and American delegations. In his letter, Davis declared that there should be no naval construction competition between Britain and America, and that the principle of equality between the British and American navies would remain unchanged. Eden's letter acknowledged this agreement, stating that there should be no naval construction competition between Britain and America, and that Britain fully agreed that neither party should question the other's right to maintain mutual equality in any type of warship, and further stated that Britain had never taken into consideration the naval power of the United States when estimating its naval needs. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington, Here, it is believed that the exchange of official documents between US Envoy Davis and British Foreign Secretary Eden re-establishing the British-American naval balance is a continuation of the 1930 naval conference policy and a guarantee that a naval construction competition will not occur between Britain and America. It is said that the exchange of documents between the two countries proves that the positions of the two countries aim to avoid giving rise to the impression that an alliance has been formed between Britain and America. Officials here state that there is no meaning of an alliance, let alone anything else. (National Telegraph dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington, After the signing of the Anglo-American-French naval treaty, there was a general welcome here. Secretary of State Hull, in the name of President Roosevelt and himself, sent a telegram to the US Chief Representative Davis, extending his congratulations. The authorities concerned regretted that quantitative restrictions could not be established, fearing that the United States would have to increase naval expenditures in order to maintain its security. However, the United States wishes to prevent naval competition, and the construction program will be limited to destroyers and submarines to reach the numbers stipulated in the 1930 London Naval Treaty. As for other types of ships that have exceeded their service life, they will be replaced. For example, the battleships "Arkansas" and "New York", whose service lives expired in 1932 and 1934 respectively, the Navy Department will begin constructing two new ships this year to replace them. If the principle of quantitative restriction is considered, the US naval policy will still maintain a ratio of 5 to 3 with Japan and maintain parity with Britain. The British government's White Paper on National Defense Plans, published at the beginning of this month, stipulates the addition of 20 light cruisers to reach a number of 70. The US Navy Department also intends to add several warships to maintain parity, but the type of warship to be built has not yet been decided. In addition, members of Congress, due to the fact that Japan has established naval bases on the mandated islands in the Pacific, have also proposed deploying defenses on the US-owned islands in the Pacific. However, officials are unwilling to express their views, and this issue will inevitably be mentioned when Congress discusses the approval of the naval treaty in the future. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London, In view of the fact that Article 19 of the Washington Treaty will no longer be effectively enforced, Britain is building defensive works and naval bases in the Far East. Japan has inquired of Britain about its intentions in this regard. Britain, America, and Japan are currently discussing this matter through diplomatic channels, and Japan has not yet given a final reply. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">London Naval Plenary Session <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>London, The naval conference held a plenary session at 4:15 PM today in the Queen Anne Room of St. James's Palace, where Britain, France, and the United States signed the naval treaty. The original chairman was British Foreign Secretary Eden, but because Eden did not arrive at the venue until the signing, Lord Monsell, the British Secretary of the Admiralty, temporarily chaired the session. The chairman spoke first, followed by American Chief Representative Davis, and then the signing ceremony was held. After the ceremony, French Chief Representative Ambassador Corbin, Indian representative Boardlow, and Italian Chief Representative Ambassador Grandi delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at 5:17 PM. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London, At today's meeting, in addition to Italy not signing the treaty, the South Irish Free State and the South African Federation also did not sign. South Ireland had separate political reasons, believing that the naval treaty could have a dangerous impact on the state's policies. The South African Federation, on the other hand, said that it has never had a navy from the beginning. Japan sent two observers to attend the ceremony, one being Fujinami, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Britain, and the other being Navy Captain Fujita, but neither spoke.

<p>London, British Navy Minister Monsell spoke after the signing ceremony, hoping that Italy and Japan would join the treaty in the future, and welcoming Japan's promise that it does not intend to take any action that would promote future naval construction competition. He also said that the signatories of the Washington Treaty, including Japan, will soon sign a draft treaty stipulating the use of warships in wartime, which he considered a good sign. US representative Davis said that while this new treaty did not satisfy the best hopes, it retained many values of the old treaty and contained important new clauses. The United States is willing to reduce the size of warships, but since the United States began building warships, it has only been 15 years, and it must wait until the United States has experience with one or more new types of warships before it can determine the extent to which the tonnage of warships can be reduced. The US representative also said that if the number of warships increases, even if the tonnage of each ship is reduced, it will not promote disarmament. Freedom regarding the number of ships is something we use improperly, and this largely depends on the goodwill of the naval countries to abide by the spirit and letter of the new treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">US Representative Speech: Naval Competition Can Be Avoided <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London, Davis, the chief representative of the United States at the London Naval Conference, today signed the Anglo-French-American naval treaty on behalf of President Roosevelt and narrated the United States' policy and opinions on naval disarmament and expressed optimistic hopes for the opportunity to reduce armaments in the world. Mr. Davis said that the United States was very pleased to sign this treaty, "Which can help implement some of the basic principles of naval disarmament, and with the goodwill of the naval countries, it can prevent naval competition after the expiration of the Washington and London treaties." Mr. Davis solemnly stated that the United States regretted that this treaty could not stipulate quantitative reductions and limitations on naval strength, because the attitude of the United States has not changed since 1921, and it still believes that the only way to stabilize naval relations between countries is through reduction. However, the United States has not abandoned the hope of future quantitative restrictions, "If we consider the world situation at the opening of the meeting and the various crises after the opening, it can be seen that its success was indeed unexpected. Moreover, military expansion is actually a response to international instability and mutual suspicion. Therefore, in this environment, it is impossible to reduce armaments on a large scale." Mr. Davis also said that the danger of competing to build new types of warships is actually greater than competition in numbers, because new things are enough to arouse mutual suspicion, and building new types of warships to make existing warships obsolete is the most wasteful competition. Therefore, quantitative restrictions are most valuable. This concluded treaty can show the wisdom of the representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in working hard to reach an agreement after the Japanese representatives withdrew from the meeting. There are many clauses in the treaty that can help countries avoid unnecessary construction. The most important is that each signatory country must notify each other of its construction plans in advance, and the strict system of exchanging information with each other can avoid suspicion and prevent mutual competition. "We believe that this will regulate a country's construction program without being seen as an action that harms other countries." Mr. Davis went on to say that the United States has allowed the suspension of the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers for six years to show that the United States is willing to limit naval construction at any time. However, if an agreement is reached on this point, it must be conditional on not excessively increasing the number of smaller cruisers, and after mutual notification and consultation, this agreement can also be terminated. The reason why the United States cannot allow the reduction of the tonnage of battleships to below 35,000 tons is because the United States has not built this type of warship for fifteen years, so it must build one or two more before it can be sure of the tonnage of this type of warship can be reduced. However, it is hoped that this issue will be discussed again in the future. As for whether quantitative restrictions can ultimately solve naval competition, it is impossible to know at present, but if there is a broader treaty in the future, it can be used as a transition, and international understanding will not be destroyed.

<p>Legislative Yuan to Review County Judicial Office Organization Regulations Today Nanjing</p>
<p>The Judicial Yuan believes that after the implementation of the Court Organization Law, local courts should be established in all counties. However, due to the lack of talent and funds, it seems difficult to promote this universally at once. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily establish judicial offices in counties where local courts cannot be established, in order to provide relief and establish the first step towards judicial independence. Provisional regulations for the organization of county judicial offices have been drafted and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Review Committee has completed its review, and the result is that this transitional method is only approved to be valid for three years. At the same time, the Judicial Yuan must jointly with the Executive Yuan properly plan funding to universally establish local courts throughout the country within three years, in order to improve the judicial organization. As a result of the review, it has been decided to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review on the 27th.

<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Improving Tobacco Production in Guangdong</p>
<p>Establishing Tobacco Trial Field in Nanxiong County</p>
<p>Providing Low-Interest Loans to Tobacco Farmers for Planting</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently implemented a special tobacco trade and is trying to develop local tobacco cultivation to resist the encroachment of imported cigarettes. According to a survey, the total annual output of local tobacco leaves in Guangdong Province is 429,193 dan (100 catties per dan). Of this, 63,100 dan are exported and more than 366,000 dan are sold domestically. The annual sales value is more than 8,635,000 yuan. In this province alone, about 108,500 dan of flue-cured tobacco are sold. If improved further, local tobacco can easily regain the market share of imported cigarettes, saving a considerable amount of money that flows overseas each year. The largest production areas of local tobacco in the province are Nanxiong in northern Guangdong. Since the authorities implemented the local tobacco monopoly, the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Unified Tax Bureau has appointed a resident Nanxiong specialist manager to set up a monopoly office in Nanxiong City and provide low-interest loans to tobacco farmers in accordance with regulations, so that tobacco farmers can have capital to engage in planting. The loan methods are as follows:</p>
<p>1. In order to promote the improvement of tobacco production by farmers, the Tobacco Trial Field has specially formulated these methods for compliance.</p>
<p>2. The occupational scope of the loan for tobacco planting by this field is temporarily limited to a certain area.</p>
<p>3. All farmers who apply to this field for a loan to plant tobacco must fill out an application form in accordance with these methods and submit it to this field for review.</p>
<p>4. Farmers who apply for a loan to plant tobacco must have a guarantee from the Nanxiong Tobacco Leaf Sales Cooperative or a reputable store before they can get the loan.</p>
<p>5. The loan amount is temporarily set at two dan of fertilizer per mu (the price of this fertilizer is negotiated with the fertilizer manufacturer at ten yuan per dan, including freight), and a certain amount of tobacco seeds are provided free of charge. After the harvest, the tobacco leaves will be returned, and the value of the tobacco leaves will be agreed upon by this field and the borrower at the time of signing the contract.</p>
<p>6. Farmers who apply for a loan to plant tobacco must sign a loan contract with this field in person when the loan is approved.</p>
<p>7. Once the tobacco leaves are harvested, tobacco farmers who have taken out a loan to plant tobacco must send them to this field's improved curing room to dry and hand them over to this field as repayment of the loan. The calculation is based on the agreed value in the contract. Any surplus will be returned and any deficiency will be recovered.</p>
<p>8. All curing labor, materials and expenses shall be borne by this field.</p>
<p>9. Tobacco farmers who have taken out a loan to plant tobacco must plant at least half of the planted area with the tobacco seeds provided by this field. The rest can be freely planted with local tobacco leaves.</p>
<p>10. The tobacco seeds planted by tobacco farmers who have taken out a loan shall be supervised and managed by this field and shall not be freely sold. The planting methods must also be subject to the instructions of this field. If there is any deliberate violation, this field may revoke its contract at any time and recover all outstanding payments.</p>
<p>11. The original curing room of tobacco farmers who have taken out a loan must be supervised by this field for reconstruction. The reconstruction and equipment costs shall be provided by this field. The amount loaned shall be repaid to this field by the borrower starting from the settlement year.</p>
<p>12. If the tobacco farmers who have taken out a loan do not continue to renew the contract in the settlement year, the curing room and equipment built by this field may be dismantled by this field, or the farmer may prepare funds to take over.</p>
<p>13. If there are any matters not covered in these methods, they shall be submitted by this field to the competent authority for approval and addition or deletion.</p>
<p>The Nanxiong Tobacco Trial Field is jointly operated by the Department of Construction, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Nanxiong County Government. The field is located in Nanxiong County and has an area of 30 mu. All trial tobacco varieties, cultivation methods, tobacco production methods, and breeding of superior tobacco seeds are implemented in the field. (March 20)</p>

<p>Smuggling Remains Rampant After Tianjin Customs and Railways Implement Anti-Smuggling Measures</p>
<p>Japanese Consul in Tianjin Lodges Protest</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After the Tianjin Customs and the Beining Railway established six anti-smuggling measures and began implementing them on the 21st, the Customs, for the convenience of handling affairs, established a Customs Inspection Office for Railway Goods at No. 181 Xinda Road, Hebei, and assigned two foreign customs officers to be stationed there permanently to handle the procedures for inspecting declaration forms. In addition, four customs officers were stationed at each of the East and West Main Stations to collect tax bills from freight owners day and night and on holidays. The goods that are required to be declared for inspection include rayon, cigarette paper, seafood, alcoholic beverages (whiskey, champagne, etc.), radio equipment, fur, velvet, medicines, car tires, rickshaw tires, porcelain, soap, and various colors of cloth, totaling dozens of types. According to this list of goods, the railway will refuse to load any freight that the owner requests the railway to transport without going through customs inspection procedures. However, since the implementation of the measures, few people have declared for inspection. Goods transshipped to other places, under the armed protection of Japanese and Korean ronin, are loaded onto large cars and no longer take the railway. Instead, they display the flag of the Japan International Transportation Company and travel south along the Jinpu Railway. Those transported to the Huainan area are loaded onto trains between Jinghai and Cangxian and transported to that area. Those transported to Gaoyang and Qingyuan in southern Hebei are sent by car. Every time smuggled goods are transported out of Tianjin, when passing through the Da Yingmen thoroughfare, the ronin hold a gun in their hands, glare angrily, and rush past the inspection post. Therefore, smuggling is rampant and has not been affected by the implementation of the new anti-smuggling law. As for those smuggled from eastern Hebei, because the puppet government has recently set up tax checkpoints along the ports of Changli, collecting extremely low tariffs, the ronin hold the tax bills and load the goods onto trains to Tianjin for public unloading. When customs officials inquire, they show the puppet tax bills as proof that the tax has been paid, and customs officers cannot interfere too much, otherwise disaster will strike. Therefore, the smuggling of goods from eastern Hebei has not been affected by the new anti-smuggling law. Regarding the assistance of the Jinpu Railway in anti-smuggling, the Tianjin Customs sent the method established with the Beining Railway to the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway, requesting assistance as usual. The office forwarded the request to the head office, and on the 22nd, it received a reply by telegram approving it. On the 23rd, it also followed the request of the Customs and refused to load foreign goods that had not been declared for inspection and did not have a declaration form. However, this rule is limited to the East and West Main Stations in Tianjin, and the efforts of the customs officials themselves at each station along the line will determine the outcome. Lin Shize, the superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the 22nd. Regarding the diplomatic problems caused by the Customs and the Railway Bureau's anti-smuggling efforts, he assisted Chen Zhongfu and Chen Juesheng in resolving the diplomatic disputes. According to him, the anti-smuggling measures of the Tianjin Customs and the Railway Bureau are not thorough. In eastern Hebei, the fundamental problem lies in the abolition of the puppet regime and our problem. It is currently difficult to figure out how to combat smuggling. Since the smuggling of foreign goods has not been successfully stopped, and there are fears of causing misunderstandings abroad, it is more important to remove unexpected difficulties than to combat smuggling. He said that if difficulties are removed, anti-smuggling can be carried out as desired. His words show that there are still many thorns on the road ahead. As for the Japanese side, they believe that the Tianjin Customs and the Beining Railway's assistance in anti-smuggling hinders the sales of Japanese goods, and they also point out that the Beining Railway Bureau is deliberately discriminating against Japanese goods and helping the Customs in its investigations. On the 21st, Kawayue, the Japanese consul general in Tianjin, sent the commercial consul Nishida to visit Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, to lodge a verbal protest. Chen told him that the Customs was in charge of this matter, and the Beining Railway only provided assistance within the scope of its capabilities and had no intention of discriminating against Japanese goods. If the procedures for Japanese goods were complete, they could be loaded and transported at any time. Nishida did not find the reply satisfactory and visited Xu Liya, the chief of the Tianjin Customs, that afternoon, making the same statement. Chen Zhongfu and Chen Juesheng visited the Japanese consul together on the 23rd to explain the misunderstanding, and the Japanese side's anger began to subside. The Beining Railway also replied to the Japanese consulate in writing on the same day. According to observations, the Japanese ronin's smuggling to and from Japan has not been affected, and the Customs does not dare to enforce the law for fear of unexpected changes. The Japanese protest is only a necessary expression and may not be expanded. (23rd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou Busts Counterfeit Foreign Currency Agency</p>
<p>200,000 Yuan in Counterfeit HSBC Banknotes Seized</p>
<p>Coining Machine and Principal Culprit Captured Separately</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangzhou and Hong Kong have close commercial relations, and trade between Chinese and foreign merchants is flourishing. Moreover, due to the proximity of the locations, foreign currency has always circulated in the interior of Guangdong Province, with British HSBC banknotes flowing into the interior the most, occupying an important position in the financial sector of Guangdong Province. Since HSBC banknotes are mixed with domestic legal tender on the market, criminals often counterfeit HSBC banknotes and mix them on the market in order to make huge profits. A few years ago, the case of Cui Mingzhou counterfeiting HSBC banknotes in Henan, Guangzhou caused a sensation. Unexpectedly, after Cui was executed, the communists dared to imitate his old tricks and manufacture counterfeit HSBC banknotes. Recently, counterfeit HSBC banknotes have been discovered on the market again. Upon receiving the report, the authorities secretly dispatched detectives to investigate closely. After three months of investigations, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Guangdong Military Police Headquarters has found clues and learned that there are three counterfeit currency agencies: one is Zhang Meicheng's store at No. 18 Datang Street, Xichan Branch, Xiguan, Guangzhou, one is a residence on Zilai Street, Section 3, Panyu, Henan, and one is Jianzao Company at No. 10 Huanan Heng Street, Changshou Branch, Xiguan. The Jianwei Company is the central agency. Recently, due to the widespread deployment of police officers, the central agency moved to Guiyuan Residence at No. 11 Yaohua Lane. Chen Bingsheng, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Military Police Department, led detectives to search the locations on the morning of the 19th of the month. First, they went to the Wei Jian 造厂 factory and seized a set of printing plates for manufacturing counterfeit HSBC banknotes, a bottle of chemicals, and more than 1,000 yuan of counterfeit HSBC banknotes with a face value of 100 yuan. They immediately arrested four shop employees, Tan Lun, Tan Weizhi, Tan Weimin, and Tan Weichang, at the factory. Then, they sent another team to search No. 11 Yaohua Lane and arrested the principal culprit, Tan Chang. They also found a large and small counterfeit currency manufacturing machine in the basement of the house, and a total of 200,000 yuan of counterfeit HSBC banknotes (with a face value of 100 yuan). Finally, they arrested the store owner, Zhang Jinpei, at No. 18 Datang Street, who was said to be closely related to the case, and found a counterfeit HSBC 100-yuan note, a 50-yuan note, and three 10-yuan notes in Zhang's house, and sent them all to the county for investigation. The principal culprit, Tan Chang, was sent to the Ministry for interrogation. He confessed to manufacturing counterfeit HSBC banknotes. It is said that Tan studied abroad, is fluent in European and American languages, and is skilled in mechanics. The counterfeit currency manufacturing machine that was seized was made by him. There is no noise during printing, so it is not easy for outsiders to hear. The manufactured counterfeit currency is not much different from the real one. Upon closer inspection, the colors are the same, but the watermark of the counterfeit one is not obvious. Ordinary people do not notice the flaws. It is also said that Tan was an assistant to Cui Mingzhou, the perpetrator of the counterfeit foreign currency case a few years ago. After Cui's death, Tan resumed his old business and was only busted now. (March 21)</p>
<p>Three Ministries Study Balancing International Trade Methods</p>
<p>Advocate Managing Imports and Increasing Exports</p>
<p>Also Plan to Establish International Trading Company</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Production and Construction Effort Plan passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the relevant ministries to draft implementation methods. Regarding Section 9 of the plan, which is to properly plan methods for balancing international trade, the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs held a meeting at the Ministry of Industry at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th to study the matter. Those attending the meeting from the Ministry of Finance were Gao Bingfang, Feng Dian, and Wang Shinai; from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were Wu Songxiao and Yuan Zijian; and from the Ministry of Industry were Zhang Yichou and Ma Keqiang, etc. As a result of the research, the following principles were formulated:</p>
<p>As a result of the research, it was decided that the Ministry of Industry should draft a trade balancing plan based on the following principles and submit it to the Executive Yuan:</p>
<p>Manage imports and increase exports.</p>
<p>Guide exporters to unite effectively to seek direct exports, and the government should establish a government-business joint international trading company.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at about 11:00 a.m. According to the results of the Ministry of Industry's research on the value of major import and export commodities in the past three years, the main factor contributing to China's trade deficit is that imports are greater than exports. The adjustment method should be to strive to promote increased exports. The survey and research figures are listed below for the reference of those concerned about international trade.</p>
<p>Value of Imports in the Last Three Years</p>
<p>Statistics on the value of major imports in the last three years: Rice: 150,107,416 in 1933, 65,684,678 in 1934, 89,562,586 in 1935; Wheat: 87,871,028 in 1933, 31,869,171 in 1934, 34,887,254 in 1935; Flour: 27,755,408 in 1933, 7,075,112 in 1934, 6,006,607 in 1935; Kerosene: 87,450,738 in 1933, 39,750,042 in 1934, 37,606,901 in 1935; Cotton: 98,160,982 in 1933, 90,246,597 in 1934, 40,913,429 in 1935; Cotton Cloth: 58,243,433 in 1933, 26,781,690 in 1934, 20,604,803 in 1935; Metals and Minerals: 97,066,538 in 1933, 98,884,321 in 1934, 87,442,948 in 1935; Machinery: 43,178,244 in 1933, 59,306,338 in 1934, 65,853,248 in 1935; Tobacco: 29,643,711 in 1933, 34,016,399 in 1934, 11,300,883 in 1935;</p>
<h3 id="e35">French Representative's Speech: Practical Effects are Better Than Nothing <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>London - The chief French representative, Mr. Corbin, delivered a speech saying, "The French government is very pleased to sign the Second London Naval Treaty (the First London Naval Treaty was only signed by England, the United States, and Japan, and France and Italy did not participate). Since the opening of the naval conference, the difficulties encountered have been numerous. Although the new treaty has now been established, its scope is not as broad as we had expected. In addition, the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was signed by England, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan, but now only three countries have signed the new one. All these shortcomings are enough to expose the difficulties we have encountered. The system of quantitative restrictions for a long period no longer exists, and the French delegation does not regret this, because the results obtained from the implementation of this method for fourteen years have only proved its arbitrary nature and made all countries feel unhappy. Regarding qualitative restrictions, we hope that our original intention was not too extravagant, but that we would achieve tangible results. Unfortunately, the results obtained have not fully met our expectations. However, we also know that the current qualitative restriction method, even if it has little practical effect, is better than nothing. Therefore, we still accept the huge tonnage figures for battleships. Fortunately, the naval treaty contains a clause stipulating that these figures can be reconsidered and reduced by the countries concerned in 1940, which is what France is comforted by. In addition, the caliber of battleship guns has been reduced from 16 inches to 14 inches, which is also a tangible progress. As for the tonnage of Class A cruisers, France originally advocated reducing it. Later, because the new naval treaty stipulates that countries may not build 10,000-ton cruisers during the effective period of the treaty, France has also accepted it. It is deeply hoped that countries will not build such warships before the new naval treaty is ratified. In addition, the new naval treaty also includes a clause, that is, it is hoped that the naval armaments of various countries will be reduced in the future. This is what the French representatives expect. We believe that if all countries can gradually expand the exchange of information methods stipulated in the new naval treaty, the result of reducing naval armaments can be achieved quickly. In short, the signing of the naval treaty this time is the first voice in implementing the various principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant. From now on, if no unexpected events occur regarding the shipbuilding issue, so that the mutual trust between naval countries can be restored, it will be even more hopeful," he said.

<h3 id="e36">Italian Representative's Speech: Never Forget Sanctions <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>London - The chief Italian representative, Ambassador Grandi, explained that Italy is still subject to sanctions and therefore cannot sign the naval treaty, saying, "If countries want to sign an agreement to limit armaments, they must trust each other and cooperate fully to be successful. It is certainly not the way to establish a system of military agreements and threaten one of the signatory countries. The Italian people are heartbroken and indignant at the sanctions, and regard them as unfair. Now there is a so-called mutual assistance agreement in the Mediterranean, which aims to use military strength as a backing for sanctions. Under such circumstances, the Italian people all feel that Italy's life is in danger in the Mediterranean. This is an innovation in the history of unified Italy. We hope that this situation will end soon," and so on. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Key Points of the Naval Treaty <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>London - The full text of the naval treaty between England, France, and the United States is divided into five parts, plus two annexes. The main points of the treaty are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Part 1: Definitions of ship types. The tonnage and ship types of various ships, whether sailing on the surface or underwater, are explained.

<p>Latvia's capital - The government previously cracked down on a secret organization of the German National Socialist Party on the 22nd of this month, and arrested many of its leaders. The person in charge is unwilling to disclose much about the inside story of this case, but it is known that the authorities have long been aware of the activities of this group, which secretly planned to harm Latvia in the name of tourist groups or sports groups. Most of the members are young students. After joining the party, they all receive military training and maintain close contact with Germany. Among those arrested this time, there are the group's leader, Kraetzig, and retired Colonel Hirt. At that time, Kraetzig was preparing to read a report sent from Germany, the content of which was a fierce attack on the Latvian government. The police unexpectedly broke in and arrested them. The police are currently continuing to investigate in order to eliminate the remaining members. The public opinion circles advocate that the arrested criminals should be severely punished to warn others. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Mexico City - A freight car loaded with mining explosives at the Dulto Anggo station on the railway between the capital and Agambaro City suddenly exploded, completely destroying the station, killing 20 people and injuring 50.

Unexpectedly, during the transfer, the explosives car was suddenly hit hard, and the explosives exploded immediately, causing a tragedy. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>British House of Commons Discusses Diplomacy - Foreign Secretary Delivers Political Views - Advocates Negotiations with Germany - While Protecting the Safety of France and Belgium</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden made a speech on the current situation when debating diplomacy in the House of Commons this afternoon, expressing the different views of England and France on the German troops entering the Rhineland. He said that the French government requested that if the Rhineland troops could not be withdrawn by other means, then financial and economic sanctions should be adopted to force them to withdraw. Britain recognizes this view, but would rather try to restore trust through negotiation procedures. Germany believes that the French-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is in conflict with the Locarno Pact. It means that this dispute should be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Pact. The British recognize that Germany's reasons are legitimate, but are also sorry that Germany did not resort to theory but to force. Britain, as a guarantor of the Locarno Pact, has a real commitment. He does not want to be the Foreign Secretary who recognizes the obligations of the British government in addition to the treaty. The proposals contained in the White Paper are proposals, not letters of condolence. If the German side does not make a constructive contribution, those who are willing to negotiate will have no way to carry out their work. As for the current talks between the British and French chiefs of staff, they are purely related to the obligations under the Locarno Pact and do not increase our political burden. In short, the necessary maintenance of the safety of France and Belgium is a matter of great concern to Britain. Britain has obligations to the world under the League of Nations Covenant, but does not want to increase its work except within the scope of the existing Locarno Pact. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>London - German representative Ribbentrop went to the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 Downing Street this morning to visit Prime Minister Baldwin. Baldwin declared to him that it was regrettable that the memorandum submitted by the Locarno Conference was clearly rejected by the German government. He hoped that the German government could submit a concrete counterproposal after the election on the 31st of this month in order to start negotiations. As for the House of Commons opening this afternoon to discuss foreign policy, Ribbentrop will not be present to listen. According to his entourage, Ribbentrop may return to Berlin tomorrow. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Today, the newspapers here feel that the content of the "temporary reply" submitted by the German chief representative Ribbentrop to British Foreign Secretary Eden is not very substantial and expresses considerable disappointment, but the parliamentary side believes that the German government cannot be expected to put forward a more concrete counterproposal in such a short period of time. The political figures here feel pleased about one point in the accompanying statement of the German reply, saying that since Germany is preparing to put forward more practical suggestions at the end of the month, at least it can make all negotiations still have a chance to continue. After the German government's "temporary reply" was delivered, the cabinet immediately convened a meeting to discuss it. It was decided that the handling of foreign policy issues in the House of Commons will no longer be requested for postponement. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Eden will be able to attend the House of Commons tomorrow afternoon to answer the questions of the members of parliament on foreign policy issues.

<p>Moscow - Officials here recently declared that Germany's resolute rejection of the agreement reached at the Locarno Conference was caused by the inconsistent British policy before and after. The British cabinet adopted a non-firm attitude on this issue, and the public opinion of the country did not support the above-mentioned suggestions. Therefore, the general public will inevitably be alienated from the League of Nations. From then on, the countries will also use the League of Nations as a screen and compete to conclude military alliances. The drawbacks will be unimaginable. As for the peace policy that Soviet Russia has implemented in the past few years, it was originally based on the League of Nations. If the League of Nations has made friends feel disappointed, Soviet Russia will only take appropriate steps immediately to protect itself. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Locarno Issue - Italy is Still Playing a Waiting Game - Believes that There is No Need to Submit a Reply <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Rome - Political figures recently expressed their views, saying that if Italy actively cooperates with the countries concerned in accordance with the spirit of the Locarno Pact or the Streis Treaty, although it will be enough to strengthen the united front of England, France, and Italy, it will not be beneficial to Italy itself. As far as the Locarno Four-Power Agreement on the 19th of this month is concerned, since Germany has refused to accept it, it cannot be implemented. Italy naturally has no need to submit a reply. However, Italy still considers the Locarno Pact to be valid, which can be seen from two things:</p>
<p>Before, when the issue of the oil embargo was very noisy, the Italian side stated that if the League of Nations imposed an oil embargo on Italy, then the country would declare the abolition of the Locarno Pact, which shows that Italy still considers this pact to be valid. The representatives of the four signatory countries of the Locarno Pact recently held a meeting in London. Italian representative Grandi cooperated with the representatives of the other three countries, which is also enough to prove that Italy still considers itself a signatory country of the Locarno Pact.</p>
<p>In short, although Italy has stated that it will not sign a new agreement with the countries that implement sanctions as long as the sanctions are not lifted, it has not recognized the obligations stipulated in various past treaties, such as the Locarno Pact. This is because when the representatives of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact conducted talks in London, Italy refused to impose sanctions on Germany, but according to what the reporter of this agency knew, the country's intention was that if there were other methods that could be adopted other than sanctions, the country was still prepared to implement them, because the country has always abided by this pact.

<p>Recent three years' statistics of major export commodity values: Raw Silk: 1933: 57,287,933; 1934: 28,755,688; 1935: 40,537,926. Tea: 1933: 34,210,037; 1934: 36,098,549; 1935: 29,624,184. Cotton: 1933: 30,228,958; 1934: 15,200,779; 1935: 21,732,316. Tung Oil: 1933: 30,261,269; 1934: 26,216,683; 1935: 41,582,879. Eggs and Egg Products: 1933: 36,479,624; 1934: 30,243,526; 1935: 32,069,462. Cotton Yarn: 1933: 40,006,825; 1934: 31,293,901; 1935: 19,213,489.</p>

<p>Statistics of total import and export values and trade deficit: 1933: Imports: 1,345,567,188; Exports: 61,827,990; Trade Deficit: 733,739,198. 1934: Imports: 1,029,665,224; Exports: 535,214,279; Trade Deficit: 494,450,945. 1935: Imports: 919,211,322; Exports: 5,758,090,60; Trade Deficit: 343,402,262.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Foodstuffs Rank First in Imports <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>From the above figures, it can be observed that foreign imports over the years are dominated by foodstuffs. For example, the combined value of rice, wheat, and flour imported in 1935, along with the "other miscellaneous grains and flours" item listed in the customs trade book at 5,460,871, totals 135,927,318, accounting for two-fifths of the total trade deficit that year. Cotton and its products exceeded 60 million, also accounting for one-fifth of the total trade deficit that year. As for China's exports in 1935, tung oil ranked first, raw silk second, eggs and egg products third, and tea fourth. Except for tung oil exports, which increased compared to previous years, silk and tea have both declined. Comparing the 200,000 dan of raw silk exported in 1935 to the 900,000 dan in 1920, it is nearly less than a quarter. Tea exports in 1935 were 29 million yuan, compared to 88 million yuan in 1920, also only slightly more than a quarter. For thousands of years, China has been known as an agriculture-based country. Trade with advanced industrial nations involving the import of manufactured and semi-finished products is certainly to be expected, but this year, foodstuffs unexpectedly rank first among imports, accounting for the largest value of imports, while exports of agricultural raw materials are declining year by year. The trade trends and their harms are evident.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Efforts to Promote Increased Exports <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ministry's research results, the main factor constituting the trade deficit is indeed that imports are more than exports. The adjustment measures, in addition to passively reducing unnecessary imports, should focus on actively promoting the increase of exports, which is the most urgent task at hand. The formation of China's huge trade deficit is in fact due to insufficient exports. For example, in 1933, the total value of imports reached 1,345,567,188 yuan, while the total value of exports was only 62,827,990 yuan, only about 45 percent of imports. Compared with the major trade deficit countries in the world in the same year, China's ratio of import trade to export trade is the lowest in the world. If exports can be increased in the future, the international trade situation will gradually tend towards balance.

<h3 id="e60">Soaring Rice Prices in Anqing, Public Security Bureau Requests Restriction on Purchasing and Transporting <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: In Anhui Province, after the disaster of famine, it is now the spring famine season. In recent months, rice merchants in the provincial capital have resumed purchasing large quantities of rice for transportation out of the province, causing rice prices to rise sharply, threatening the people's food supply. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has specially requested the Provincial Government to follow the established precedent and restrict purchasing and transporting. The original request is as follows: "We have investigated that various counties in our province are frequently experiencing floods and droughts. The rural areas near the provincial capital are suffering severely. In previous years, due to food shortages, rice riots occurred. Afterwards, rice was purchased from other areas and provided at affordable prices to relieve the situation, and the riots subsided. Last year's autumn harvest in various counties was still poor, and rice prices were high, no less than in previous years. Even the existing rice in this city is already insufficient to meet demand. Furthermore, rice merchants, disregarding the people's food supply, are purchasing large quantities of rice every day for transportation out of the province. According to recent investigations, from the first day of this month to the twentieth, major steamships have transported a total of 4,578 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice. Small steamships and sailing vessels are not included. This has caused rice prices to soar, reaching ten yuan per shi. In the aftermath of the disaster and during the spring famine, the sudden increase in rice prices is unbearable for the people. If restrictions are not implemented, rice riots may be repeated in the future. This would directly harm the people's food supply and indirectly affect public order. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, filled with anxieties, cannot remain silent. We propose that your government follow the past precedents of prohibiting rice and issue a strict ban, and restrict the amount of rice that each steamship and sailing vessel passing through can purchase and transport. Large steamships should not exceed six shi, small steamships should not exceed two shi, large sailing vessels should not exceed one shi, and small sailing vessels should not exceed five dou (a smaller unit of dry volume). If these limits are violated, the rice being transported will be confiscated in its entirety, and the transporting merchants and civilians will be punished to maintain the people's food supply and preserve public order. This is our responsibility. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document to your government for review and implementation." (March 24)</p>
<p>Wujiang: Huang Heng, the former secretary and chief of the fourth section of the County's Anti-Opium Committee, was secretly investigated by the Jiangsu Provincial Commissioner of Inspection, and it was discovered that Huang had accepted a bribe of 1,800 yuan from local opium trafficker Cai Zhen. County Magistrate Xu sent personnel to Suzhou to place Huang under the custody of the Security Team headquarters, awaiting the commissioner's disposition. Yesterday, the County Government received a telegram from the commissioner ordering that the matter be handled according to the law. County Magistrate Xu, being concurrently in charge of judicial affairs, reasonably recused himself. He immediately dispatched police officers to escort Huang Heng and the case files to the Suzhou Higher Court, designating the relevant agency to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Suzhou: The appeal in the case of love between master and servant is concluded. Liu Xi, the wife of Liu Zirong, son of Liu Huizhi, the former General Manager of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank (Xi, daughter of a high official, her name is Xi Yunqing), and Wu Wenxiang, Liu Zirong's chauffeur, were charged with adultery. The Shanghai District Court sentenced Wu Wenxiang to one year and six months in prison. Wu Wenxiang appealed the original verdict to the Higher Court, which held a preliminary hearing. As Liu Xi did not attend, the hearing was continued yesterday (26th) at 2:30 PM. Liu Xi still did not attend. Wu Wenxiang hired lawyer Dong Banggan to appear in court as his counsel. Under the jurisdiction of Wang, of the Criminal Division, the First Court convened. Wu Wenxiang's testimony remained the same. He claimed that the adultery was induced by Liu Xi and that she threatened him with death, etc. After lawyer Dong's defense, the presiding judge declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for March 31st. Wu Wenxiang was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Lawyer Shen Yuankai accused his wife, Wu Cuiqin, of having an affair with a man surnamed Xu and that she was already four months pregnant, while he had been living apart for a long time. He filed a complaint with the Wuxian District Court, requesting a divorce. After repeated hearings without a resolution, the case was continued by Judge Zhu Ganlin of the Civil Division yesterday (26th) at 10:00 AM. Shen continued to accuse his wife based on the aforementioned reasons. Unexpectedly, Wu was menstruating and presented a sanitary belt in court to show Shen, proving that she was not pregnant. The audience burst into laughter, and the judge had no recourse. Wu Cuiqin was sent to Zhihua Hospital for a medical examination, and the results confirmed that she was not pregnant. Separate interrogations were conducted again before the court adjourned to deliberate and render a judgment. This is indeed a curious incident in the legal community.</p>
<p>The principal offender in the Xianzi Mountain massacre is sentenced to death.

After the Public Security Bureau arrested two key offenders in the case, surnamed Qian, they were sentenced separately. The principal offender in the case, Gao Caifu, was also apprehended by the Public Security Bureau's detective team, taken to the Wuxian District Court for questioning, and found guilty. He was sentenced to death yesterday.</p>

She had two bags containing a commission order from the Changxi Tobacco, Alcohol, and Excise Tax Collection Bureau, three credit slips from Pu Tingsun, and other miscellaneous items. He took her to the bureau for investigation. She claimed her name was Qian Youyue, 20 years old, and that she had stolen from Pu Tingsun's house at No. 34 Dalou Lane and was involved with a small-time gang living in the house of the notorious gangster Yi Zhong on Dongxin Road. Yi reportedly had three to four thousand disciples. The owner of the stolen goods, Pu Tingsun, was summoned to the bureau to identify the items, which he confirmed were his. He also stated that Qian Youyue was the adopted daughter of his cousin, Pu Rongqian, and a graduate of a certain girls' middle school, so she was literate. She had stolen 250 yuan in foreign currency last year in June and disappeared without a trace. After hearing the confession, Chief Hong immediately transferred her to the main bureau, and yesterday she was transferred to the court for trial.</p>

<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>(I) The Meaning and Types of Cooperatives</p>
<p>The cooperative movement is a movement to promote the cooperative system. But what is a cooperative? Simply put, a cooperative is an organization that, in the spirit of equality and mutual assistance, voluntarily unites the efforts of a number of people to improve the lives of these people and to improve the economic situation of the entire society.</p>
<p>Comparing a cooperative with general business methods, it can be said that cooperatives have five characteristics:</p>
<p>Equal Equity: Ordinary joint-stock companies are based on the shareholders' capital, and the larger the share capital, the greater the power, so the shareholders can control everything. Cooperatives are not like this, their power is distributed on a per-person basis; any member, regardless of the amount of capital they have paid, is limited to one vote.</p>
<p>Open Organization: Companies with the purpose of doing business generally have a fixed amount of capital, and only within this amount can their shares be bought and become a shareholder. Therefore, the price of shares often changes with the prosperity and decline of the business. If the business is booming, it is necessary to pay a high price to buy its shares. Cooperatives are not like this, their members can join at any time, and the capital is unlimited, so their shares will not [] in price.</p>
<p>Limited Dividends: Because dividends are the income of property, and there are many elements of unearned income in it, cooperatives often have dividend restrictions. Ordinary companies also have dividend regulations, but they are often relatively high. Moreover, the profits of general companies are enjoyed by the shareholders, so even if the dividend restriction is low, it is not very meaningful.</p>
<p>Return of Profits: I have already said above that the profits of a company are enjoyed by the shareholders, but cooperatives are different. The profits that it settles annually or semi-annually are returned to where they came from. Only in this way can price fairness be achieved and mutual exploitation be avoided.</p>
<p>Social Purpose: Cooperatives are organized to seek the interests of their members, just like companies are organized to seek the interests of their shareholders, seemingly without difference. However, the shares of cooperatives are very small, the equity is equal, the organization is open, and the profit distribution method is different, so in practice, it is very different from companies. The purpose of a company is to make money, while the purpose of a cooperative is to seek social benefits.</p>
<p>The above is the meaning of cooperatives. As for their types, the more important ones are production cooperatives, utility cooperatives, purchasing cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and insurance cooperatives. The nature of each type of cooperative will be explained separately below.</p>
<p>Production Cooperative: Production is the act of creating or increasing utility to meet social needs. Therefore, a production cooperative is a group of people who unite their strength to engage in the increase or creation of utility based on the meaning of cooperation. Examples include cooperation in breeding, planting, and processing in the agricultural sector, and cooperation in construction and manufacturing in the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Utility Cooperative: It is where many people unite to jointly purchase and use production equipment, such as water pumps, rice harvesters, seeders, and trucks, to compensate for the lack of individual financial resources and to seek economy of use.</p>
<p>Purchasing Cooperative: It is where production supplies, such as seeds, raw materials, and fertilizers, are purchased jointly, using wholesale methods to reduce prices and reduce miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>Marketing Cooperative: After production is completed, a group of people unite their products to jointly transport and sell them, in order to raise prices and reduce costs. It is also called a sales cooperative.</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperative: The term consumer cooperative usually refers only to the joint purchase of consumer goods. The consumer cooperatives or cooperative stores that we often see are only purchasing cooperatives for consumer goods. In fact, cooperation in consumer behavior, such as cooperative cafeterias and cooperative housing, should also be called consumer cooperation, so the former can be said to be broad consumer cooperation, and the latter can be said to be narrow consumer cooperation.</p>
<p>Credit Cooperative: Personal credit is not enough, so a group of people unite their credit to achieve their goals, that is credit cooperation. For example, if twenty people join together to form a loan group and borrow money from a bank, each person bears joint and several liability, that is, if one person is unable to repay the debt, the others must be responsible for repayment. This is also a kind of credit cooperation. With this guarantee of joint liability, it is not only possible to obtain loans, but also to not have to provide collateral, which is not good? However, a true credit cooperative should also be able to absorb the deposits of its members, so that the money deposited by some members can be lent to members who need loans. Therefore, a credit cooperative is like a miniature bank. Of course, the profit distribution methods of banks and credit cooperatives are different. Because the profits of a bank are only distributed to the shareholders, while the profits of a credit cooperative, in addition to dividends and reserve funds, are distributed to the depositors and borrowers, because the profits of a credit cooperative come from them.</p>
<p>Insurance Cooperative: The insurance industry has not yet developed in China, but in foreign countries, half of the people have life insurance, and many houses have fire insurance. The reason for wanting insurance is to distribute the risks of a few people to many people in order to reduce the burden of risk. Because, based on the meaning of interest rates or chance rates, if many people buy insurance, it is unlikely that everyone will encounter danger. However, insurance companies aim to make profits, and the insurance premiums they charge are very high. If many people can unite and use cooperative methods to insure themselves, then the benefits obtained are the same, and the insurance premiums can be saved a lot. Moreover, insurance companies do not distribute profits, while the profits of a cooperative can be distributed, which is also an advantage of insurance cooperatives.</p>
<p>(II) The Importance of Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>Speaking of the importance of cooperative enterprises, it can be explained in three points:</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of economic policy, the goal of economic policy is, first, to increase production efficiency, and second, to achieve fair distribution of wealth. There are several conditions for increasing efficiency: land improvement, capital accumulation, labor effort, and strict organization, which are the most important. From these conditions, we can see the importance of cooperative enterprises. Because the utility cooperative mentioned above is a method to improve land and increase labor efficiency. In addition, credit cooperatives can help with capital accumulation, and the problem of farmers lacking organization is also solved with cooperatives.</p>
<p>Secondly, the development of cooperative enterprises will certainly hinder the interests of the current capitalist class. Therefore, from the perspective of society as a whole, cooperative enterprises, in addition to increasing production efficiency, also have the benefit of making the distribution of wealth fairer, which undoubtedly makes cooperative enterprises a most perfect economic policy. There are two keys to the fact that cooperative enterprises can increase the fairness of social wealth distribution: the first is the union of buying and selling, and the second is the distribution of profits. These two methods can reduce the income of those who originally had a lot, and increase the income of those who originally had too little, so the relationship to wealth distribution is very significant.

<p>French Concession Authorities Do Not Interfere with Aviation Donations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the incident of the French Concession authorities interfering with the solicitation of aviation donations, the General Captain's Office of the China Aviation Association, after inquiring about the situation, received a reply from the Police Department of the French Concession stating that hotels and restaurants were fined for including the donation amount in the bills. If they adhere to the principle of voluntariness, they will not interfere. It is reported that the office has replied, explaining that if there are any inappropriate practices in the future, please notify them in advance so that they can directly notify the relevant parties to avoid incidents and maintain friendship. Please instruct the relevant departments to notify separately to facilitate the process. The office also sent a notice to the Hotel Association, the Restaurant Solicitation Committee, and the hotels and restaurants in the district, enclosing the letter from the French Concession Police and the responsible announcement published by the police in various newspapers, requesting them to follow the prescribed principles, not to include the aforementioned donation amount in the bills, but only to attach a receipt for the National Aviation Salvation Fund, and to work hard to achieve the goal of saving the country and saving oneself, so that the future of the nation and the people will be bright.</p>
<p>According to a news from the Political Department of the French Concession, reports in the local newspapers that the French Concession authorities were obstructing aviation donations are not in line with the facts. The French authorities had no interference in the aviation donation issue from the start. However, there was an agreement with the Aviation Association in advance that the donations must adhere to the concession regulations, which clearly state that the donations must be voluntary and not compulsory. Recently, a small number of stores have been forcing customers to pay donations, so the concession authorities had to correct it. As for other businesses that collect donations in accordance with the principle of voluntary donation, there is no need to be alarmed.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the General Captain's Office of the China Aviation Association previously received reports from the hotel and restaurant industries that the French Concession Police were interfering with the solicitation of funds for national aviation salvation. After inquiring about the situation, Li Dachao, the Consul General, received a reply from the Police Department of the French Concession stating that hotels and restaurants were punished because they included the donation amount in the bills without following the rule of voluntary donation. If they adhere to the rule of voluntary donation, they will not interfere. It is reported that a reply has been sent, explaining the situation, and requesting the relevant departments to notify separately to facilitate the process.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Chinese Merchants Emphasize Chinese in Insurance Policies; The Machinery Union Requests Explicit Regulations <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Association of Domestic Machinery Factories yesterday petitioned the Executive Yuan to stipulate in the Insurance Law that Chinese insurance policies issued by Chinese merchants should be the standard. The original text reads: "Regarding the clauses listed in the insurance policies of Chinese insurance companies, they all contain the phrase 'English shall prevail.' We earnestly request that this be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and amendment of the Insurance Law. At the second meeting of the ninth session of our Association held on February 7th of this year, Cai Shengbai, representative of the Meiya Silk Factory, proposed that the insurance policies of Chinese-operated insurance companies are both in Chinese and English, and it is stated that in the event of any discrepancies between the Chinese and English versions, the English version shall prevail. This is indeed humiliating to our national dignity, and since Chinese people do not fully understand English, insurance companies often use the English version to interpret matters in their favor and evade their liability for compensation when misfortune occurs, leaving policyholders at a loss for words. Taking out insurance in this way is no different from throwing money away, without obtaining the actual benefit of insurance. Taking the factories of our Association members as an example, there are too many cases of evasion of compensation liability to count. If we do not petition the central government to include in the Insurance Law the provision that insurance policies used by Chinese insurance companies should be in Chinese, and if other languages are used, it should be clearly stated that the Chinese version shall prevail, then the losses we suffer in insurance matters will know no end." When this was discussed, the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense, and a unanimous resolution was passed. It was noted that our Association had already submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry for correction on August 21st of last year, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was also requested to persuade the industry to make corrections, as recorded in the files. Subsequently, a reply was received from the Ministry of Industry, ref. Shang Zi No. 37041, stating, "Received your submission. Regarding the case of changing the articles of incorporation of Chinese insurance companies' insurance policies to use Chinese, the Shanghai Civic Federation had already sent a telegram requesting this in August of the 21st year, and an order was issued to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Chinese Insurance Industry Association to comply. Now, based on the previous situation, the Bureau has been ordered again to instruct the Insurance Industry Association to comply with the previous case. You are to be informed accordingly." However, the Chamber of Commerce replied with a letter from the Insurance Industry Association, claiming that the insurance policies and receipts had been universally using Chinese for two years, and pointed out that the proposals of Meiya Silk Factory were a misunderstanding. Meiya Silk Factory, based on actual facts, repeatedly refuted this and sent a letter to our Association on September 25th of last year to forward to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Insurance Industry Association. Unexpectedly, it was not until January 9th of this year that a reply was received from the Association stating, "Received your important instructions regarding the case of Chinese insurance companies changing to using Chinese forms, and am very grateful for your concern. The Legislative Yuan is currently deliberating on the Insurance Law, and the basic terms of this insurance policy will naturally be stipulated therein, which should alleviate your worries." The company's words seem to suggest that the reason why insurance policies are not based on Chinese is because the government has not stipulated it in the Insurance Law. Their tactic of strong arguments and quibbles is the same as their usual way of dealing with policyholders when unfortunate events occur, misinterpreting English and evading compensation liability. It is not known that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had already submitted a petition in November of the 19th year to order Chinese insurance policies to be changed to Chinese, and the Civic Federation also submitted a petition in August of the 21st year to order them to be changed to Chinese. Our Association has also repeatedly submitted letters requesting correction, and the Ministry of Industry has repeatedly ordered compliance. Six years have passed, but the insurance policies used by the insurance industry still contain the phrase "English shall prevail." To our countrymen, to our government, this not only violates the public opinion of various organizations and policyholders, but also treats the Ministry's orders as trivial. Their obstinate situation, if not intending to deceive the people by means of foreign languages, who would believe it? Now, with the unanimous resolution of all two hundred and dozens of members, a document is prepared again to petition your esteemed Yuan for review and approval to "forward it to the Legislative Yuan" for discussion and amendment of the Insurance Law, that the insurance policies used by Chinese insurance companies should use Chinese characters, and if other domestic or foreign languages are used, it should be clearly stated that the Chinese shall prevail, so as to prevent the insurance industry from taking advantage of loopholes and to enable policyholders to obtain their due rights and interests. This is for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted.</p>

The Association has received numerous letters from users in various districts who, due to the increase in telephone prices, have requested instructions on how to handle the payment issues for January. After receiving the letters, the Association believes that this issue is of great importance and has scheduled the fifth board meeting for 3:00 PM today (the 26th) at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace Bridge, third floor, and invited advisory committee members to attend and discuss countermeasures together. The Association yesterday received a letter from Cui Qingxi, a Master of Economics from Syracuse University in New York, forwarded by the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank, detailing a comparison of telephone rates in Britain and the United States, which can serve as a basis for negotiation. The original letter stated: "According to the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News of March 10, a spokesman for the Shanghai Telephone Company said, 'A telephone call in the United States costs three US cents, equivalent to 11.1 Chinese cents. A telephone call in Britain costs 6.5 Chinese cents.' In his opinion, foreign gold dollars should be used as a basis for comparing Chinese telephone rates. This is actually a misrepresentation of the facts. Although Britain and the United States use gold dollars, it is only nominally a gold standard, and there are no real gold dollars of equal value as a standard. For example, a single US dollar coin is mostly made of silver, and its weight is even less than that of a Chinese silver dollar, but its price is equivalent to 3.33 Chinese dollars (current market price). The so-called US telephone fee of three cents per call, equivalent to 11.1 Chinese cents, is a great fallacy. If you use the Chinese exchange rate to accurately compare, using it in the United States is equivalent to using three copper coins in Shanghai. Because in the United States, the cent is the smallest unit, and there is no smaller auxiliary currency below the cent, and the US single-cent auxiliary currency is also made of copper, and its weight is less than a quarter of that of a Chinese copper coin. However, a telephone call in Shanghai costs three cents each time, which is actually equivalent to nine US cents. The telephone fee for residents in Syracuse, New York, is only three dollars per month, and they can make unlimited calls. The telephone fees in Britain and France are even lower than those in the United States. Therefore, the telephone fee in Shanghai is actually several times higher than that in Britain and the United States. As for the legal aspect, although the regulations on concession contracts for public utilities in various countries around the world are slightly different, they are roughly divided into three types: Perpetual concession contracts. This type of contract is announced and implemented by the court and does not indicate restrictions on events. Very few are currently used, and they have almost disappeared invisibly. Short-term concession contracts are from the Ministry of Public Security. This type of contract has no fixed term, and it usually expires after about 20 years. If the company is managed properly, it can be extended; otherwise, it can be cancelled. Indefinite contracts. This type of contract has no fixed term, and the main point is that if the company's management does not meet public opinion, the government or citizens can stop its business and take it back at any time at a price. The type of contract of the Shanghai Telephone Company is not clear, but in principle it must be similar. Therefore, the government and legal groups have the right to correct it."</p>

<h3 id="e91">Zhejiang Trade Union Sends Telegram to Zhejiang Provincial Government Offering Suggestions for Consolidating Zhejiang Debt and Requesting a Loan from the Central Bank to Settle Debts <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Trade Union yesterday telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating, "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government: According to the telegrams from the Hangzhou Banking Industry Association and the Hangzhou Money Industry Association, which stated, in brief, that the bonds issued by this province include the Public Bonds to Repay Old Debts, Highway Public Bonds, Construction Public Bonds, Disaster Relief Public Bonds, Public Bonds for Clearing Old Debts, Provincial Treasury Bonds, and Local Public Bonds, totaling seven types. The Finance Department of the Provincial Government has borrowed more than 11 million yuan from the banking and money industries. Recently, the Finance Department has proposed to reduce the interest rates on various bonds, extend the principal, and change the terms of various loans, considering the contracts invalid and hindering the social credit system. Please make a unanimous appeal to maintain credit. We have learned that the various bonds of this province have reached more than 45 million yuan, requiring a huge amount of annual interest. Therefore, they must be urgently consolidated to achieve a suitable balance between the province's budget revenues and expenditures, so as to avoid further increasing the burden on the people. The issuance of bonds in this province has always been levied on the people of various counties, unlike the issuance of various central government bonds, which are exclusively underwritten by the banking industry. Moreover, the public welfare, education, and charitable funds of various counties have always been used for storage and interest, and now they are all used to purchase public bonds. If the reduction of interest and extension of principal are implemented, the local affairs of various counties will be affected. Besides, in this time of financial hardship, reducing debt to save expenses is a key plan for the present, but the government and the people should consider both. Considering that the Central Bank is a national bank with the power to issue currency and actually controls the general hub of national finance, and that the debts of this province are so huge, all due to the construction of railways, highways, and military facilities, these undertakings are related to national defense and should not be the sole responsibility of one province, we should request that the Ministry of Finance order the Central Bank to lend 50 million yuan in national currency, using the existing bond funds of this province as security, setting the lowest interest rate, and repaying the principal and interest in installments. On the one hand, all seven types of bonds issued in this province should be redeemed in advance so that bondholders do not suffer any losses, and the government can save millions of principal and interest annually, and the special construction tax can be stopped as scheduled. Various surcharges that are nearly chaotic can also be cut down year by year. Upon checking, the funds for various bonds in this province are salt surtax, special construction tax, construction surcharge, and ordinary business tax, totaling 6,801,402 yuan in the Zhejiang Provincial Budget for the 24th year. The funds for local public bonds are designated as daily land tax, deed tax, brokerage business tax, and tobacco and alcohol license tax, with an annual allocation of 1.2 million yuan. In total, the funds for various bonds amount to 8,001,402 yuan. Since the Central Government has already issued a clear order to reduce interest rates, the Central Bank should first implement low-interest loans. If calculated at a weekly interest rate of 4%, the annual cost would be 2 million yuan. If another 1 million yuan of annual bond principal is allocated, 5 million yuan can be gained from the funds. Therefore, this loan is exceptionally solid and the funds are exceptionally substantial, so it should not be rejected. In this way, turning scattered debt into a whole only requires moving and transferring debt, which can preserve credit and hopefully reduce the burden on the people. We offer our humble opinions. We respectfully request your esteemed government to review and adopt them for implementation, which would be for the public convenience. Respectfully, the Shanghai Zhejiang Trade Union."</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Chen Jintao, Chairman of the Currency System Committee of the Ministry of Finance, gave a lecture at the National Shanghai Business School yesterday on "Sun Yat-sen's Paper Money Revolution." Chen traced the motives and plans of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in advocating paper money, and praised and criticized it from a historical perspective, listing the precedents of the paper money revolution in European and American countries, most notably the gradual implementation of Gesell's Stamp Scrip plan. He also said that this time, our country's implementation of the new monetary policy, concentrating silver and promoting legal tender, is only carrying out Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Cheng Shaode, the Dean of Studies of the Business School, revealed to us the historical anecdotes of the theory of paper money revolution, which has special value in the history of monetary development in China. Moreover, Chen's high age and his spirit of research are no less than those of the past, and he is a model for young students.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Female Performer's Case of Illegal Detention Concluded Yesterday; Verdict Pending <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The case of Kunqu performer Ding Wan'e and her husband Yang Binghua being sued by their apprentice, female performer Tan Lianfen, in the First Special District Court for illegal detention has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Witnesses Zhao Chunfang, Ding Shaolan, and Kuai Qixiang all appeared in court. According to Zhao, who claimed to be mainly a Shenqu singer, on February 14, the defendant ordered him to perform at a private gathering. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the defendant's house, he was accused of having an affair with Tan Lianfen and was forced to write a letter of guarantee. He saw the defendant beat the plaintiff, but he had no real relationship with Tan. Ding Shaolan testified that she had separated from Ding Wan'e for seven or eight years. On that day, the plaintiff came to her and said that she dared not go home because she was out for a day, so she escorted her back to the defendant's house. Zhao Chunfang was already there and wrote a letter of repentance, asking her to act as an intermediary and sign her name on the letter of guarantee. She did not see the defendant beat the plaintiff. Kuai Qixiang testified that he also acted as an intermediary. Tan Lianfen testified that the witnesses' statements were partially correct and partially incorrect. She was sent to the defendant's house by Ding Shaolan that day and was immediately beaten and locked in a room. She had no real relationship with Zhao, only acquaintanceship. Ding Wan'e and Yang Binghua testified that because their reputation was involved, they used the pretext of singing at a private gathering to lure Zhao to their house. Zhao voluntarily wrote the letter of guarantee because he could not afford to marry Tan. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered both parties to argue and then announced the conclusion of the trial, with a verdict scheduled to be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>The National Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating: "It has been found that Article 16 of the current Stamp Tax Law, Tax Rate Table, Item 23, under the category of entertainment tickets, specifies that all tickets sold by entertainment venues for admission or seating are included. Hall passes and bureau tickets are not tickets sold by entertainment venues for admission or seating and are not within the scope of this item. They should be affixed with ordinary stamps. However, it has recently been found that some hotels in the concession still charge customers for stamps on bureau tickets, as stipulated in the temporarily abolished Stamp Regulations, but in reality, they do not affix the stamps. This behavior clearly involves fraud. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Concession Cigarette Investigation Office to conduct a thorough investigation and instructing the Shanghai urban area stamp tax inspectors to pay attention to whether the same situation occurs in various hotels in the urban area and to investigate them together, we hereby send a letter to your esteemed association for your information and request that you instruct the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association to inquire about individual hotels and correct them to maintain the credit of national taxes."</p>

<h3 id="e97">Tragedy Occurs Before Birthday Banquet; Police Officer at Linping Road Police Station Commits Suicide by Shooting Due to Nervous Breakdown <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At around 12:00 PM yesterday, a police officer committed suicide by shooting at the Civilian Village Police Substation of the Linping Road Police Station of the Zhabei North Station Branch. After being discovered, he was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The reasons for the police officer's despair were economic pressure and family issues. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Police Officer's Family</p>
<p>Yin Fukang, from Yancheng, was 34 years old. His home was at 5 Zao Pi Alley, Jun'an Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. Yin lost his father at a young age, and his elderly mother, nearly 80 years old, lives in his hometown, Qijia Village, about two li from Ligangmen Town. Yin's first wife died early, and he remarried Wu Xiaomao, a woman from his hometown, as his second wife at the beginning of last year. Wu is 24 years old. After the marriage, she gave birth to a son, whose milk name is Huaisheng, who is two years old. Yin previously served as a police officer in the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau (now the Yuanguan Xianggang Police Station). In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the Linping Road Police Station (formerly the Third Precinct of the Fifth District), where he served as a second-class police officer with badge number 2704. He has served in various substations under the jurisdiction. Yin was thrifty and diligent in his service and was deeply valued by his superiors. He also got along well with his colleagues.</p>
<p>Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Yin received a monthly salary of 16 yuan while serving in the police station. Family expenses exceeded income, and he felt deeply burdened by economic pressure, which often led to quarrels with his second wife, Wu. In order to save expenses, Yin sent Wu and his son Huaisheng back to their hometown to stay temporarily last winter. Unexpectedly, the family's flesh and blood were separated from then on, resulting in a tragic turn of events.</p>
<p>Shooting Suicide</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, Yin was transferred by the station chief, Niu Jingquan, to the Civilian Village Police Substation. Yin was very filial to his mother, and her 80th birthday was on the 29th of this month. He distributed invitations to friends, planning to hold a banquet at the Dafugui Restaurant to celebrate. Unexpectedly, at around 12:00 PM yesterday, while Yin was wiping his pistol in the dining room of the Civilian Village Police Substation, he suddenly felt a nervous breakdown and pointed the gun at his chest and pulled the trigger. With a loud bang, smoke filled the room. The bullet entered from the right chest and exited from the back, and he fell to the ground. Blood flowed out. The police officers on duty rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. Yin was barely breathing. They immediately reported to the police chief and called an ambulance to take Yin to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the bullet hit a vital spot, and his injuries were too severe. He died at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The hospital then notified the station.</p>
<p>Court Inspection</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the station immediately ordered bailiffs to move Yin's body to the temporary mortuary of the Tianbao Road Stack Industry Association. The local chief reported to the local court, which sent prosecutor Xiao Jinying, along with clerk Zhang Guowei and judicial police officers, to the scene at around 5:30 PM to verify the death. It was determined that he died from a gunshot wound. The body was properly prepared for burial.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation</p>
<p>All the officers and police of the Linping Road Police Station believe that Yin had served in the station for many years, was diligent in his duties, and suffered a tragic event. They plan to jointly petition the headquarters to request compensation. Yin's elderly mother, wife, and children are all in his hometown, and they have been notified by telegram to come to Shanghai to handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, in order to allow Shanghai residents to obtain accurate time, the open space of the Jianghai Customs building opposite the Bund Jianghai Customs building will use a sixty-year-old discarded cannon to fire a twelve-pound live shell every Wednesday and Saturday at noon, making a sound to inform the public. At around 11:50 AM on these two days, the employees of the signal station will install gunpowder. When they see the large ball on top of the signal mast on the Bund descend, they will ignite the fuse, and the sound will be heard immediately. In addition, residents who want to know the accurate time can dial the automatic telephone number 95678 to inquire with the telephone company and receive a reply immediately. Moreover, the "astronomical clock" placed by the Shanghai Electric Power Company in Jiangbin relies on the connected wires to adjust the time from time to time for all public and private electric clocks in the concession. This astronomical clock is made accurate by the priests of the Xujiahui Observatory. Furthermore, a certain radio station broadcasts the time on the hour throughout the day to benefit residents who do not have electric clocks. With these various conveniences, Shanghai residents can avoid the risk of being late.</p>

The bureau has also ordered the instrument manufacturing factory attached to the bureau to expedite the manufacture of various new year standard instruments for distribution to various places. It is learned that Wu Chengluo, the director of the bureau, came to Shanghai yesterday to inspect the promotion of the new system and to actually inspect the instruments used by major companies and shops, considering the extensive area and complex situation of Shanghai. He deemed the results to be good. It is said that Mr. Wu will stay for a day or two before returning to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Machine Industry Association Presents a Petition to the Ministry of Railways, Requesting the Balancing of Freight Rates <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Excessive Railway Freight Rates Hinder the Development of National Goods; Request for Deliberation on Commercial Conditions to Balance Freight Rates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Joint Association, based on letters from member factories such as the Senlin Rattan, Willow, and Grass Ware Factory, stating that excessive railway freight rates hinder the development of national goods sales, specially submitted a petition to the Ministry of Railways yesterday. They requested the ministry to deliberate on international commercial conditions and balance freight rates. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter recorded the original petition as follows: "Presenting a petition regarding the excessive collection of railway freight affecting sales, requesting deliberation on international commercial conditions to balance freight rates to benefit national goods. According to a letter from member factories such as the Senlin Rattan, Willow, and Grass Ware Factory, the various manufactured goods produced by our factories, such as grass mats (commonly known as grass carpets, made of grass), foot pads (i.e., doormats made of coconut fiber), cotton carpets (made of waste cotton), as well as rattan and bamboo ware, are sold in various ports such as Beijing, Tianjin, Pingqing, and are transported by railway. The railway bureau designates grass mats as grass products and charges them at the fourth-class rate. If they are declared as ordinary fine mats, they will be penalized. However, these grass mats are actually coarser than ordinary fine mats. For example, the selling price of each ordinary coarse mat is 70 cents, so five mats are worth $3.50. However, a grass mat is five times thicker than an ordinary coarse mat, and its selling price is only $1.80. In addition to the railway freight rate for ordinary coarse mats being classified as fifth-class, there is also the benefit of a special price that does not measure dimensions. Why must grass mats be charged at the fourth-class rate for grass products? We should request that it be changed to fifth-class, according to the regulations for ordinary coarse mats. This is the first point. The railway bureau classifies the freight rate for foreign foot pads as second-class. Our factory's foot pads are also calculated as second-class. Therefore, for $100 worth of goods shipped to Tianjin, Pingqing, the freight is as expensive as $18, which has led to the flooding of Japanese goods in those places. We should request the railway bureau to reduce it to a considerable extent. This is another point. The value of cotton carpets and wool carpets varies greatly, but the freight rate is the same for both, at third-class. We should request the railway bureau to change the cotton carpets to fourth-class to show the distinction. This is another point. As for rattan and bamboo ware, only the weight was measured in the past, not the dimensions. For example, the freight for one piece of rattan and bamboo ware shipped to distant places such as Tianjin, Pingqing, and even Fengtian and Harbin, was only $1. Now the railway bureau classifies it as fourth-class and also measures the dimensions. If it is shipped to various places such as Tianjin and Pingqing, the value of one piece of rattan and bamboo ware is limited, but the freight is as high as $6. If this rattan and bamboo ware is shipped from Shanghai to Qingdao and Dalian by Japanese ships, the freight charge is only 40 Japanese sen, which is equivalent to 54 cents in national currency. Therefore, our factory's rattan and bamboo ware used to sell 50,000 to 60,000 yuan a year along the railway line, but after the implementation of dimensional charging, it disappeared. We should request the railway bureau to examine international commercial conditions and the actual difficulties of national goods, and specially reduce freight rates to facilitate sales throughout the country and compete with foreign goods. This is another point. Currently, our factory's products, such as Japanese grass mats and foot pads, are shipped from Kobe to any port in our country and are calculated at 46 cubic feet (i.e., one ton) for freight, charging only 3 Japanese yen. National goods, on the other hand, are charged more than 10 yuan, even more than 20 yuan. If we do not receive the railway bureau's understanding, the market trade will be completely seized. We have long admired your association's tireless efforts to seek outlets for the products of member factories. We are now reporting the fact that railway freight is too heavy and asking for your assistance," etc., were sent to the association. The two railway administrations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines under your ministry aim to take into account production, sales, and transportation to seek the development of railway transportation. The intention is excellent. However, the products produced by the Senlin Factory are transported by the railway bureau, which is a heavy burden. This greatly hinders the prospects for production, sales, and transportation. In addition to writing to the railway bureau, we are now reporting the situation to you, hoping that your ministry will deliberate on a reduction to increase the railway bureau's income and benefit the production and sales of national goods. This is truly a matter of public convenience." Respectfully submitted to the Railway Department of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>One Ship Arrives Today Carrying Over Four Hundred People; Another Ship Will Arrive Next Month Carrying Over Two Hundred People</p>
<p>Empress of Britain: The Empress of Britain, owned by the Changxing Company, with a displacement of 42,000 tons, has come to the Far East from New York, USA, carrying 450 passengers on a world tour. The ship came to China via the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. At 9:00 AM today, the ship will arrive at the outer waters of Wusongkou for anchoring. Due to the ship's large size, it is inconvenient to enter the port. The company will send small steam launches to pick up passengers ashore. All the passengers will tour Shanghai in two groups. The company has hired a large number of cars and rickshaws to tour various parts of the city in the morning and afternoon. The guests will have lunch at the Cathay Hotel and return to the original ship in the evening. On the morning of the 28th, at 9:00 AM, they will take the original ship to Qinhuangdao. The group members will tour Tianjin and Beijing, and some will also visit the Great Wall of China. Then they will take the ship to Japan and return to the United States across the Pacific Ocean, which will be around May 18th. It departed from New York on January 13th of this year, taking one hundred and sixteen days to circumnavigate the globe.</p>
<p>Reliance: The German Henbin Company has had a world liner for six years, sailing to various countries in the East and West. This year, the Reliance has been reassigned and sailed from New York, USA, carrying 210 people on a world tour. The ship first went through the Mediterranean Sea, the South Pacific Islands, and then to China. Yesterday, we received a telegram stating that the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on April 3rd, stopping at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The 210 group members will tour Shanghai for one day and then go to Japan the next day, before crossing the Pacific Ocean to return to the United States.</p>

<p>Highly potent drugs such as morphine, heroin, cocaine, and red pills are able to circulate in the market because of their potent nature, which is far superior to opium, and their price is cheaper than opium. Therefore, poor people with a smoking addiction abandon opium and consume drugs. It must be known that the harm of drugs is even worse than floods and beasts. Once addicted, there is no hope of quitting, and it can reduce a person's lifespan. Therefore, the Anti-Smoking Commissioner has promulgated special provisions, stipulating that those who sell, manufacture, and transport drugs will be sentenced to the most severe punishment. The old Zha division of the Public Concession of this city has many small inns, and many of the travelers who live there are peddlers and vagrants addicted to drugs. Drug traffickers also use this area as a concentration area. Because of the strict investigation and prohibition by the division, they often rely on foreign ronin as a talisman. The division, aware of their tricks, ordered Chief Inspector You Agen to strictly arrest them. There have been repeated crackdowns, and they have been handed over to the First Special Court and severely punished. At 9:50 PM the night before, Chen Zifu from Shaoxing was selling heroin in the Yong'anfang on Edward Road. At that time, Wu Wencheng from Hebei stepped forward and bought three packets from Lu. While they were trading, they were discovered by Chinese Controller Ping Xiushan, Bao Detective Sun Dafa, and Chinese Constable No. 2291 of the old Zha division. They immediately arrested the two men and took them back to the division along with the three packets of heroin. Under strict interrogation, Lu confessed that the sales agency was located at No. 606 Edward Road. The detectives rushed to search the premises and arrested two Koreans, Cui Jingfu and Han Changdong, and a man from Suzhou, Yan Fugen (also known as Agen). One hundred and thirty-two packets of heroin were found behind Cui's coat, and a morphine syringe was found on the bed. In addition to sending the two Koreans to the Japanese Consulate, the other three, Wu Wencheng, Lu Zifu, and Yan Fugen, were sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning. The division's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case and prosecuted them according to Articles 263 and 257 of the Criminal Law, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law so that those engaged in this career would be intimidated. After Qian Hongye, the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court, rigorously questioned the defendants, he announced the judgment in court: Wu Wencheng was sentenced to forty days of detention, and Lu Zifu and Yan Fugen were each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, each deprived of public rights for ten years, and the three packets of heroin were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Lawyers' Association and the Banking Association Exchange Letters to Improve the Reasons for Returning Checks <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The exchange of letters between the Shanghai Lawyers' Association and the Shanghai Banking Association is recorded below: The Shanghai Lawyers' Association wrote in its letter: "Dear Sirs, The proposal of member He Jia states that ordinary banks, when returning checks due to insufficient funds or no funds, often write the vague phrase 'Please contact the drawer' on the reason for return slip. If the parties are involved in litigation due to the returned check, it will take more court investigation procedures, which will greatly delay the progress of the case. This is to save the face of the drawer, but it affects the interests of the other party to a considerable extent. Therefore, it is proposed that your association decide to consult the banking association to notify all banks that in the future, the reason for the returned check must be clearly written to facilitate enforcement and avoid the lawyer's case handling process. The meeting of the joint executive and supervisory committees of this association deliberated and decided that since there is a column for insufficient funds on the reason for return slip, it should be filled in truthfully to avoid increasing disputes and losses. The financial community should inform the banking and money industries associations to notify all member banks to pay attention to writing it clearly on record. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby inform you, hoping that your association will inform all member banks to pay attention to writing the reason for the returned check clearly." The Shanghai Banking Association replied in its letter: "Dear Sirs, The proposal of your association's member states that ordinary banks, when returning checks due to insufficient funds or no funds, often write the vague phrase 'Please contact the drawer' on the reason for return slip. If involved in court litigation, it will take more investigation procedures, etc. (omitted). Upon forwarding and consultation, it was submitted to our association's executive committee for discussion. The members believed that there were compelling reasons for banks to use the phrase 'Please contact the drawer' as the reason for returning a check. Banks value business and must be cautious in serving customers. If a depositor deposits money later and the check holder collects money earlier, it is common for them to be different occasionally. If the bank states that the funds are insufficient, it would lose the bank's purpose of facilitating customers. Also, if a depositor thinks that there is a slight balance in the account, the funds may be insufficient to pay. However, for the sake of the customer's reputation and its own business, the bank has to take this into account. From the above two examples, one can see a glimpse of the difficulties. However, to protect the check holder, the bank has never failed to clearly inform depositors who repeatedly issue bad checks that funds are insufficient. It has been found that most of those who are sued for returning checks belong to this category. In fact, it may not take more investigation procedures. Furthermore, after encountering a returned check, if the check holder is unable to reach an agreement with the drawer, they can request the bank to re-present the check and request a change to the insufficient funds reason slip. It seems that all parties can be taken care of. In addition to resolving to circulate the decision to all banks in the association that they should strictly apply the reason for the return of checks for depositors who repeatedly issue bad checks, we are corresponding in reply, hoping that you will investigate and inform them accordingly."</p>

<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Sheng Shengyuan, Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, jointly issued a proclamation yesterday to prohibit the private manufacture, purchase, and transportation of manual cigarette making equipment. The proclamation stated: "It is noted that there are many cigarette factories in the Shanghai urban area, and the private manufacture and sale of manual cigarettes has never been permitted, as it hinders tax revenue. The tools used for cigarettes, such as hand-cranked iron machines and small wooden machines, are even more used by private manufacturers and should be banned altogether to prevent them from spreading. This Consolidated Tax Bureau has now received the Ministry of Finance's 'Regulations on Prohibiting the Private Manufacture, Purchase, and Transportation of Manual Cigarette Making Equipment,' ordering that it be publicly promulgated and implemented immediately. This Public Security Bureau has the responsibility to assist in the investigation and arrest. To make the prohibition clear, the full text of the regulations will be jointly proclaimed for public knowledge. Hereafter, if anyone privately manufactures or uses various cigarette making equipment to supply the manufacture of private cigarettes, they will be strictly dealt with in accordance with Article 4 of the current regulations once they are caught, without leniency. Each must comply and not violate. This is the proclamation."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Request for Rent Reduction on North Henan Road <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The shops on North Henan Road and Qipu Road in the Public Concession have always been rented by Runji Company, and they have not yet automatically reduced rent. More than twenty shops, including Hesheng, Xiangtai, Shendajin, Shenglong, Lao Yonghe, etc., have jointly written to Runji Company, requesting a reduction in rent. After the January 28th Incident, business declined, and recently it has become worse. Business is sluggish, and it is difficult to maintain, and there is a trend of announcing closure. We are forced to request that the rent be reduced and discounted with reference to the examples of the British, French Concessions, the Chinese area, and the nearby Taoyuanfang, Penglu, and Haining Road, etc., to maintain the market and relieve the merchants in distress.</p>

<p>Barber Pursues Female Customer</p>
<p>Sending threatening letters and helping her escape</p>
<p>Meeting at the Great World to express his love</p>
<p>Claiming to be young and hoping to become a family</p>
<p>——Yuan Zhiguang's lustful audacity results in his on-the-spot arrest——</p>
<p>Yu Jinbao, a local country woman residing in a self-built house at the end of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, is thirty-two years old this year. In the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, she married Cai Asan, a local coppersmith who was twenty-four years old, as her husband. Unexpectedly, on the 21st and 24th of this month, she received two postal threatening letters demanding eight hundred yuan, stating that if there was no money, she and her husband would be forced to separate, otherwise they would be bombed. The first meeting was arranged in Room 406 of the Datong Hotel, and the second meeting was arranged in Room 506 of the Dongya Hotel. Yu Jinbao was shocked and reported to the French Police, who ordered detectives to go to the destination to arrest them, but there was no trace of them. The day before yesterday, a neighbor, Tao Ma, came to Yu's house to ask if Yu Jinbao had received any threatening letters, and said that she could be Lu Zhonglian. Yu pretended to entrust her, and then arranged to meet at the Great World Amusement Park. On one hand, Yu reported to the police and ordered Detective Zhou Bingcheng and Detective Zuo Qihong to disguise as tourists and enter the venue to observe the situation. On the other hand, Yu Jinbao went to the Great World as agreed. Sure enough, she saw Ma and another man, Yuan Zhiguang, whom she knew, and Ma's husband, Tao Pucheng, were negotiating. They were all arrested by Detective Zhou and others and taken into the police station. It was found that there was a segment of unrequited pursuit in this case, which led to this interesting scene. Yu Jinbao's father left behind land and property, which belonged to a well-to-do family. Ten years ago, she took Yu Jinnan as her husband, but he died of illness. Thus, Jinbao became a widow at home. However, she often went to the luxurious barbershop set up by her neighbors Tao Pucheng and Tao Ma at No. 1690 Haige Road for haircuts. As a result, she was coveted by the barber Yuan Zhiguang (from Tongzhou, twenty-four years old this year), who repeatedly teased Yu Jinbao. The shop owner Tao Jincheng also instigated him from the sidelines, but unfortunately, it did not suit Yu's wishes. She ignored him and never went to the shop for haircuts again. This happened in the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. In the autumn, Yu married Cai Asan, and the Hua Li barbershop closed down due to economic reasons. Yuan Zhiguang went to work at the Hot Spring Bathhouse on Avenue Edward in the British Concession. However, Yuan Zhiguang's desire to pursue Yu Jinbao was never released. He used these threatening letters to scare Yu, wanting to make Yu separate from Cai Asan and marry him to fulfill his beautiful dream. When Ma arranged for Yu Jinbao to meet at the Great World, Yuan Zhiguang said to Yu Jinbao, "I have been thinking of you for a long time. The name Liu Jianyin on the letters you received is my alias. Cai Asan is twenty-four years old, but I am also twenty-four years old, very young. If you don't mind, you can quickly separate from Cai and marry me," etc. Yu repeatedly said yes. Unexpectedly, the detectives were nearby, and as soon as Yuan finished speaking, Yuan and others were arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Chen Ming explained the situation and asked for a change of date for investigation. Judge Li Changnian questioned the defendants and then sent them back into custody, setting a date for review on the 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Mr. Yang Guozhu Speaks on Public Preparation for Modern Air Defense <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Guozhu, Director of the Research Department of the Chinese Aviation Association, yesterday spoke at the auditorium of the Health Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Hankou Road, at the invitation of the Chinese Staff Club of the Shanghai Municipal Council and other groups. His topic was "Preparations the Public Should Have for Modern Air Defense." About 400 members attended. The lecture lasted about an hour and covered three sections: 1. The role of aviation in past wars; 2. The progress of modern aircraft; and 3. Shanghai's position in a future world war. His speech was pertinent and to the point. In particular, the third section on how citizens should defend against air raids was easy to understand and should be common knowledge for everyone. We have specially extracted and published the main points for reference. "Civilian air defense" refers to the preparations that citizens themselves should make to defend against air raids. Defense methods can be divided into six points: 1. Light control: The first necessary measure when an aircraft attacks a city is to extinguish all lights in the city to eliminate the enemy's targets. The light control measures should not only focus on the city itself, but also on the surrounding suburbs and villages. If the lights in the villages surrounding the city are not extinguished, the enemy aircraft can still identify the location of the city. The method of light control should be proportional to the speed of the aircraft. For example, if the speed of the aircraft is 180 miles per hour, then when the enemy aircraft flies to 90 miles, the lights of the city and surrounding villages must be completely shielded within half an hour. As soon as the watchman's report is received, unnecessary lights on the street must be reduced within five minutes, because the light from electric advertisements in the city can be seen from a hundred miles away. Within ten minutes, all lights outside the door must be turned off. Within fifteen minutes, all indoor lights must be turned off or covered with black cloth, because the enemy aircraft will arrive in another fifteen minutes, and it can already see the city when it is fifteen minutes away, that is, when it flies to four or five miles away. 2. Smoke screen: Most of the current urban buildings are made of cement, so the roofs, walls, and streets are all grayish-white in color. In the dark, due to the reflection effect, they can still be seen even without light. Therefore, to avoid becoming a target for enemy aircraft, a layer of smoke screen must be added. The amount of smoke screen released should be about the same as the amount of air, because if the smoke screen is too light, it will lose its effect after dispersing in the air. However, if it is too thick, it will hinder traffic. Therefore, it is best to release the same amount of smoke screen as air, and the best direction is downwind. 3. Bunkers: In future wars, the enemy's air raids will mostly focus on urban areas, and most urban buildings are about ten stories high. If a thousand-pound bomb is dropped, the high-rise buildings within 500 meters will inevitably collapse. Therefore, it is much better to be underground than on the ground when a city is attacked by aircraft. Building bunkers underground is a place for urban residents to hide. The construction of bunkers is proportional to the population. Private bunkers should be at least seven feet deep, and the top of the bunker should be protected with steel bars for safety. The exit of the bunker should be built at a considerable distance from the house to avoid being blocked by bricks and tiles. Public bunkers in European and American countries are built in parks or other public places. France has now built sixteen tunnels that can connect the center of Paris to the suburbs. 4. Fire fighting: The materials used in urban buildings are mostly flammable. For this reason, enemy aircraft also drop incendiary bombs when bombing cities. With this fire problem, fire fighting must be given extra attention. However, relying solely on the city's fire brigade during air raids is useless. Citizens from all walks of life should prepare fire-fighting equipment and training in fire-fighting techniques in advance, and they can be temporarily organized into districts during wartime. Because there is a possibility of fire everywhere at any time during wartime, it is obviously impossible for the fire brigade to move as usual. Moreover, the depth of urban water pipes is more than five feet. If the water pipes are damaged and the water source is cut off, the citizens will be even more confused. 5. Gas defense: Poison gas already existed during the European War, but it was still in its infancy at that time. However, the progress and intensity of the manufacturing of poison gas now is enough to make people fearful. For example, if one ounce of poison gas is scattered on 50,000 cubic feet of ground, everyone who comes into contact with it will die. In this way, if two tons of poison gas are dropped on Shanghai, which is 26 million cubic feet, then none of the citizens of Shanghai can be spared. Regarding defense methods, you must wear a gas mask outdoors. If you meet someone suddenly, you can temporarily use a wet towel instead, because the acid in poison gas can be neutralized with water. However, this method cannot remedy mustard gas. As for the interior, the most important thing is to isolate the doors and windows from the outside air. To isolate the doors and windows, thick flannel can be used instead of glass. At the necessary entrances and exits, shower heads should be installed to release water so that the poison gas does not invade. However, these are all superficial lectures. To be safe, in addition to the mask, you must also wear gas protection equipment. 6. Hiding: Most people always run away when they see a dead machine. In fact, you must know that it is not as clear to look at the sky from the ground as it is to look down from a high place. Generally, aircraft flying above 6,000 feet can already see people from 11 miles away. So, if you wait until you see the aircraft to escape, it will be too late. You should escape when you hear the sound of the aircraft, otherwise you can only lie still. If you have to escape, then you can only escape to the left or right of the aircraft, because the aircraft flies in a straight line. One more thing to note is that when escaping from the aircraft, you should run along the side of the street that is not exposed to the sun.</p>

<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association of this port, under the guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee, is an organization to seek welfare, fight for rights, and relieve suffering for ordinary poor rickshaw pullers. The internal organization is complete. In addition to the headquarters, branch offices have also been established in various districts to facilitate the work of the association. All work that can improve the knowledge, morality, and sports of rickshaw pullers has been carried out one after another. Therefore, all real rickshaw pullers, after running around with sweat and blood, and enjoying the rights they deserve in life, all think of the source when drinking water and have a considerable good feeling for the Vehicle Committee. Recently, rickshaw pullers in Nanshi presented a plaque to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. The Vehicle Committee officials had dissuaded them in advance, saying that there was no need to use the funds earned from hard work and the savings from frugality to make such an extravagant waste. However, the rickshaw pullers insisted on their decision and wanted to make a considerable expression. Moreover, the plaque had already been made, and it would be a pity to discard it. Therefore, on the 25th of this month, they sent several representatives to the Nanjing Mutual Aid Association to hold the presentation ceremony and invited members of the Vehicle Committee to come and give instructions. The ceremony was extremely solemn. The plaque was inscribed with "To Mr. Messi, Mr. Zhu Mao Cheng, and Mr. Wang Zhi Ren of the Public Concession Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee for Remembrance," with the four large characters "My Relief and Guarantee" in the middle, and the words "Respectfully erected by all public rickshaw pullers in the South District" below. After the presentation ceremony was held on that day, the members of the Vehicle Committee expressed their gratitude, took a photo, and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Bribery Case Between Judge and Lawyer: Investigating Joint Photos as Evidence, Summoning Yang Shaopeng's Wife and Shen Fengzao for Questioning, Law Enforcement Officers Searched Without Success, Yang's Wife Claimed Ignorance <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai Local Court, and Yang Shaopeng, a miscellaneous lawyer, were previously reported for receiving bribes. The Jiangsu High Court has ordered the arrest and transport of Tan and Yang to Jiangsu for detention and investigation. It is now known that Yang Shaopeng has confessed in the Jiangsu High Court that he and Tan Zhuohong took a four-inch photo together in Shanghai. Tan had also invited him to drink wine at the Grand California Western Restaurant. All the wine invitation letters, joint photos, and the glass negative of the photo were entrusted to his wife, Yang Chen, to send to Shen Fengzao's home at No. 6, Xian Deli, Xizang Road for safekeeping. The Jiangsu High Court believes that the photos and invitation letters are important evidence. Because Yang's wife, Chen, resides at No. 30, Lane 120, Baker Road, Shanghai Public Concession, it specially sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, ordering Yang's wife and others to hand over the evidence. The First Special District Court has sent police officers to the residence twice for a search, but nothing was found. Yesterday afternoon, Yang Chen and Shen Fengzao were summoned to the court. Judge Jiang Shuzi informed them of Yang Shaopeng's statement in Jiangsu, saying that Yang had confessed that the photos, invitation letters, and other items had been ordered to be sent to Shen's home. Now, after two searches of your home, nothing has been found. It must be that you have already sent them there. You must know that concealing evidence is a criminal act. You should hand them over yourself. If you wait to be searched in the future, you will be punished according to law, and it will be too late to regret it. However, despite the court's repeated instructions, Yang Chen insisted that she did not know. Then, Shen Fengzao was questioned. He confessed that he only met Yang because he asked Yang to represent him in a lawsuit. The court questioned whether there was any family relationship, as Yang called him "Big Brother." Shen confessed that this was just a common way of addressing someone and denied that Yang's wife had sent photos and invitation letters to him for safekeeping. Then, Judge Zi issued a photograph negative, which was unrelated to the bribery case, that had been found in Yang's home to Yang Chen for collection and instructed her to find the photos and invitation letters taken together by Yang and Tan and present them to the court for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Bihan Institute Asks the Social Affairs Bureau to Relieve Poor Children <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Shanlian Association closed the Second Bihan Institute of the Chaozhou-Huishan Villa on Xieshi Road, the poor people have been dispersed. Those who are from other provinces were escorted back to their hometowns by ships on the Yangtze River. However, it was found that there were 31 poor children who were orphaned and had no one to rely on. In order to avoid them becoming vagrants, the association specially sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to find a way to relieve them. The letter stated that our association established temporary Bihan Institutes at the Chaozhou Guild Hall and the Chaozhou-Huishan Villa in Nanshi last winter to take in poor people in the city who had no clothes or food and refugees from various provinces who came to Shanghai to avoid disasters. A total of more than 4,000 people were accommodated. Now that the weather is getting warmer, we have decided to close the institute. In addition to dispersing the poor people or sending them back to their hometowns, we have found that there are 31 poor children, including Liu Zhangyuan, who are orphaned and have no one to rely on. After leaving the institute, they will inevitably wander in the city and have no way to make a living. If they can be given appropriate education or industrial skills, they can make a living in the future. The Shanghai Caohijing Vagrant Training Institute has done a great job in educating and raising vagrant poor children. We hereby request your bureau to negotiate with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to send personnel to the institute to transfer the 31 poor children, including Liu Zhangyuan, to the Vagrant Training Institute for accommodation and education to provide relief. We are sending a copy of the list of poor children for your reference. We hope you will check and handle it and reply. It is now heard that there are still more than 300 poor people living in the First Institute. Because of the spring cold weather, Chairman Wang ordered a postponement of half a month before closing it.</p>

<p>The "Lincoln Zephyr" car, which has the value standards of Lincoln and Ford, is the latest product among mid-priced cars and will meet people in Shanghai soon. Mr. Bowen of the Meitong Motor Company, who manages this car, invited the Chinese and foreign press of this port yesterday to visit the sample car and take a test ride. More than twenty people arrived and took short test drives in batches. They felt light and smooth, and its smooth running and magnificent appearance complemented each other. When it stands out, it is like an arrow leaving the string. Compared with the old-fashioned cars that are usually seen, it is far away. It is heard that the company has scheduled a public exhibition at the showroom at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Meierxi Ai Road in this port on the 28th and 29th of this month. At that time, those who love inexpensive, stable, and fast cars will naturally want to see it first.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Railway Bureau Stipulates Methods for Reporting and Transporting Less-Than-Carload Consignments of Tung Oil <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau's Traffic Department reported that the Nanchang Bridge Stationmaster had reported that customers transporting less-than-carload consignments of tung oil to Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Nanjing, and other stations used to be assembled and exported with fresh eggs from the Shangbeizhan Station. Since the implementation of direct less-than-carload consignments to Nanjing, less-than-carload consignments of tung oil have often been too small in quantity to be loaded into a separate car. They must be stored for a considerable period of time before they can be shipped, which inevitably delays the transportation of goods. It has been decided that shippers should temporarily purchase a number of sturdy oil pans to hold the tung oil in the pans so that it can be assembled into one car with dry goods. A trial run will be carried out from late February. The results of the three decisions to transport tung oil to Zhenjiang and Nanjing are very good. The Bureau has also approved the Shandong pans that have been loaded. From April 1st, following the method of transporting pigs in iron fences, the pans will be transported back to the station of origin free of charge from the station of arrival at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Guangdong Rubber Company's Creditors' Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The company owes more than one million yuan</p>
<p>The reconciliation plan will be decided at the next meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company, since it ceased operations on November 3 last year, owes more than 1,044,000 yuan. Because it was unable to pay, it applied for understanding to the First Special District Local Court. The court accepted the case and convened the first creditors' meeting at Husheshe, Guizhou Road, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm to discuss the reconciliation plan. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present Yesterday's creditors present were Shanghai Electric Power Company, Jin Hongshi, Mei Zuishi Cai Binwei, Bu Naimen Ouyang Wenqiu, Silk Industry Bank, Fen Ling, Dongfang Printing House Jiang Dafu, North China Coal Industry Company Yang Zhiyi, Gao Yi Public Hall He Huiliang, Mao Sheng Electrical Materials Store Sun Zhongrong, Minsheng Company Dong Bingzhuang, Aikelong Yanghang Sun Yushu, Hefeng Qianzhuang Yu Jiaxiang, Taian Company Wang Jingsheng, and 54 other households, representing a claim of 179,486.80 yuan (the Shen Bao's claim was 470,134.65 yuan, and the registered amount was 377,011.76 yuan).</p>
<p>Chairman's Report The meeting was chaired by Judge Yu Lude of the First Special Court and Assistant Supervisor Accountant Li Ding. Ying Yeping, the court clerk, was the recorder. First, Judge Yu announced the purpose of the meeting, and then Accountant Li Ding reported that the total debt was 1,044,679.56 yuan and the actual value of the assets offset against the debt was 812,878.30 yuan. There were three reasons for the shutdown: A. Small capital and large scale, with no working capital in peacetime; B. No organization in accounting, so the accounts are chaotic, so the asset-liability situation cannot be expressed at any time; C. Too many borrowed funds. Based on the above reasons, the company was already in a state of financial hardship before the shutdown. However, the company's products are very suitable for the needs of modern society, so the creditors also know that the company's resumption of operations is the only hope for repaying debts.</p>
<p>Reconciliation Plan Then, the reconciliation plan proposed by the debtor Deng Zhaozhen was discussed. After discussion, it was decided that the plan still needed to be studied. The chairman then announced the adjournment of the meeting and waited for the decision of the second creditors' meeting. The original text of the reconciliation plan is presented below: A. All of the factory's trade names, trademarks, machinery, property, and all movable property shall be managed by the creditors providing funds within the scope of not hindering the exercise of the original powers. The method shall be in accordance with the covenant decided by the creditors. B. After the factory resumes operation, all profits from the business shall be used to repay the debts until all debts are repaid. If the creditors find that there is no profit or do not want to maintain it after accepting the management, the creditors may apply for bankruptcy. C. If the creditors cannot agree on a uniform basis, the procedure for distributing the remaining funds according to the proportion of the debt shall be as follows: the creditors who provided the funds shall be repaid the principal and interest at a monthly rate of 7% from the date of providing the funds until the date of repayment. After the above debts are repaid, 30% of the net profit shall be extracted first, with 15% being a special bonus for the creditors who provided the funds, and the remaining 15% being used to repay the old debts of the creditors who provided the funds in advance as a reward for providing the funds. The remaining 70% shall be distributed to all the creditors.</p>

<p>The Deceased was Yu Hongyuan, Formerly a Small Vendor</p>
<p>Due to Poverty and Illness Combined with His Adopted Son's Unfilial Conduct</p>
<p>At 11:25 PM last night, a man of about fifty years old, wearing short clothing, suddenly fell from the third floor of a certain playground in the French Concession and committed suicide. As the location was right next to the manager's office downstairs, it was immediately noticed and reported to the accounting office. Upon rushing to investigate, he was found to be already dead. After carefully examining the deceased's face, it was recognized that he was Yu Hongyuan, a local who used to work as a vendor selling items in the playground. He had a son named Xiao Fusheng, who also once worked at the playground but was later sentenced to imprisonment for a crime and is still in custody. The playground's accounting office immediately reported to the police station. The police chief ordered a detective to go to the scene for inspection and found a suicide note on the body. The wording in the letter mainly stated that he was suffering from economic hardship, was old and sickly, and his adopted son was unfilial. After the detectives completed their investigation, they immediately notified the Tongren Fuyuan branch to send undertakers to carry the body to the mortuary, pending a report requesting the Second Special Court to send personnel for an autopsy. The suicide note was kept in the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e129">City Architectural Association Releases Impressions of the Chinese Architecture Exhibition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the preparation for the Chinese Architecture Exhibition has been underway for several weeks. In addition to the participation of various architectural engineering groups and individuals in the city, various material merchants have also actively participated. Moreover, telegrams from various provinces requesting to join and sending exhibits to Shanghai have been continuous, truly a grand unprecedented event in the architectural field. The Shanghai Architectural Association has published an article detailing the nature of the exhibition. It is reproduced below. Recently, Mr. Zi Gongchuo and others, in conjunction with various architectural engineering groups in the city and individuals and groups interested in architecture, initiated the Chinese Architecture Exhibition. It is scheduled to open before the opening of the Shanghai Municipal Museum, using the new building of the museum as the venue, and is scheduled to open on April 12, with the exhibition lasting for one week. In addition to the collection of architectural drawings and models by Mr. Guan Song Sheng and Mr. Zhao Shen, who are in charge from the Architectural Society of China, the Peking China Construction Society will also transport valuable items collected over the years, such as palace books, drawing plates, Song paintings, and Song tiles, to Shanghai for display. This type of architectural exhibition is still a new concept in the city. At that time, it will surely attract people from all walks of life to visit and empathize with its importance. And the greatness of the architectural industry for social culture and industry and commerce will therefore have a further understanding. The reporter is not very talented, and at the current grand event, I dare to contribute a point of view for the association to adopt. In the "National Reconstruction Program" written by the late Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen, it was stated that the construction industry is the largest enterprise in the international program. This statement is indeed true. Generally, people think that builders are all manual laborers who work hard with their hands and feet, but they do not know that builders are actually the culmination of various industries. Therefore, if you want to observe the rise and fall of a country, you must take buildings as the main material of observation. For example, archaeologists go around searching for ancient sites, all wanting to examine historical materials in broken monuments and remnant steles. Also, when we first arrive in a foreign country, we always want to see the long-standing architecture first. If our country's Peking ancient palace, Great Wall, etc., are all noted by archaeologists from various countries, and do not hesitate to travel across the ocean to visit China, those who have a biased view of the construction industry can often thoroughly understand this. And the holding of the architectural exhibition is also intended to correct the erroneous views of the general public, and to arouse attention, so that they know that architecture is closely related to housing, industry and commerce, transportation, national defense, history, and culture. This decision to hold the exhibition uses the new building of the Municipal Museum as the venue to display architectural drawings, models, calligraphy and paintings, and drawing plates. If there is not enough space, the new building of the Aviation Association can be used as the need for displaying building materials and tools. It is also learned that the municipal government will send invitations to various institutions, groups, and schools to visit at that time, so the number of people attending the meeting will be large. Therefore, the exhibits must be carefully presented. In my opinion, the display of drawings should be categorized and arranged in separate rooms. For example, for residences, Chinese style, English style, French style, American style, modern style, Spanish style, etc. should be distinguished. Also, hospitals, schools, public offices, hotels, offices, department stores, etc. should be classified and displayed according to their types. Exhibits that are not classified by type but have historical significance should be divided by era. In this way, it is orderly and the visitors can follow it. There is an indispensable display in the venue, which is the architectural system diagram. The so-called architectural system refers to the process from the architect's surveying of the construction site to the design of sketches, formal drawings, drafting of construction contracts, contracting regulations, civil engineers' plans, steel reinforcement concrete foundation and beam column roof truss and other structures, and the design of junior engineers, hot and cold water pipes, bathroom kitchen equipment, and heating and cooling settings. Also, the plans of electrical engineers, indoor lighting, electric fans, electric bells, electric heating and other devices, and the working conditions of pipeline engineers, decoration engineers, and workers in various industries, and the supply charts and explanations of various building materials, so that visitors can understand the building process of a house, which is extremely complex and not as simple as the average person imagines. In this exhibition, there are many valuable exhibits, as mentioned above, as well as the Old Summer Palace photos, models, calligraphy and paintings of the Peking Library, etc., which are all rare treasures. Therefore, compiling an exhibition journal to promote it is necessary. The journal can photograph and publish the exhibits in the exhibition, and also the preparations of the exhibition, the honorary chairman, vice chairman, and the chairman and vice chairman's inscriptions or dedications, experts' writings, the introduction of materials manufacturers' exhibits, the manufacturing process, the selection of raw materials, and the explanation of their uses, and the catalog of exhibits, etc., can be published as much as possible to promote and commemorate. However, there have been several opinions on the compilation of this booklet. Some say it should be printed together with the "Architectural Monthly," others say it should be printed together with the "Architectural Monthly" and "Chinese Architecture," and others say it should be printed independently by the association. In summary, it is appropriate to print it independently. This exhibition is still a new concept, so there must be a special publication to praise it. Although the cost is slightly higher, what harm is there? Article 5 of the Architectural Exhibition Association Charter, the scope of soliciting exhibits includes the item of soliciting tools. This will definitely arouse the interest of the visitors. The tools of each industry can be divided into two types: manual and machine. If the brick and tile workers use machines to mix mud, make blanks, and fire them, compared with using manpower or ox power to mix mud, manually make blanks, and fire in earth kilns, and woodworkers use spring saws to saw large sections of wood into boards, then use circular saws to saw into strips, and then use cut-off saws to saw into short sections, after which they use hand planes to polish them, one side at a time, flat planers to roll them flat, line planing machines to plane lines, foot chiseling machines, barrel head machines, gluing machines and other abutting actions, and stone machines to split stone, grind stone, cut edges, and iron machines to plane, drill, turn, rivet, weld, paint acid brushing, spraying, dipping and other processes, so that visitors to the exhibition can visit several factories at the same time. In this short period of time, it is practically impossible to arrange so many machines and tools, or to omit machine tools and only display hand tools, which will not arouse the attention of the general public. Therefore, the item of tools can be temporarily omitted due to circumstances, and preparations should be made early for the next exhibition to achieve perfection. However, it is not appropriate to give up eating because of choking, and the remedy is to ask building material merchants to take photos or display real objects of raw materials, manufacturing methods, and tools when displaying their products, and add explanations. This is better than nothing. The architectural exhibition is intended to arouse the attention of the general public, so it is feared that simply displaying drawings will not be fully understood. It is best to make more models. Among the eastern styles, Indian, Japanese, architectural carvings and paintings, and the architecture of the Near East, Egypt, Syria, Syria, Persia, and the Western classic, revival, and Greek Roman transformed styles from Britain, France, Germany, etc., select the whole and reduce it by several times in scale, or select the parts and make models of plaster or lime in the same scale, and add explanations to each part and the process of historical transformation. Also, famous buildings in our country's history, such as Epang Palace and Deer Terrace, can also refer to ancient books, plan drawings, and make models, and go to the sites to excavate, or may be able to dig up broken bricks and tiles for the exhibition, which will also be of great benefit to our country's archaeology. According to this search, after several years of effort, the historical materials of architectural history will also be greatly supplemented. Our country is known as an ancient country with 5,000 years of culture, but the history of architecture is still lacking, which is really embarrassing. Therefore, architects who are directly responsible for this task should rise up and catch up, and continue to move forward after this exhibition in order to implement their responsibilities. The Chinese Architecture Exhibition should still be retained after the exhibition is over, and the municipal government should be requested to allocate land and funding in the city center to build a venue and establish an architectural museum, and continue to manufacture models and other exhibits, and collect historical materials on architecture, then the importance of this museum will not be less than that of the library and museum. Shanghai is a gathering place for Chinese and foreign people, and international visitors will come in droves. Those who first set foot on this land are shocked that this is not the Shanghai of the East. To correct this view, it is necessary to visit the city center and the various departments of the architectural museum to make them appreciate the greatness of Chinese culture and gain a good international impression. Therefore, the establishment of an architectural museum is also an urgent matter.</p>

<p>— Compiled by China Credit</p>
<p>3. Commercial Group Organizations of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry</p>
<p>1. Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Trade Association. This association is abbreviated as the Miscellaneous Grain Association. Its address is No. 312, Minguo Wai Road, Xinbeimen. It was founded in the ninth year of the Republic of China. At the beginning of the organization, the soybean and rice industry's prestigious figures concurrently served as the directors of the association. The first president was Mr. Ye Huijun. In addition, vice presidents and directors were elected from the Hakka community. Later, the president system was changed to a committee system, and the current chairman of the committee is also Mr. Gu Shengyi. Since its establishment, although it has only a history of thirteen years, it has been the most powerful among the rising forces. Its members are based on the soybean and rice industry, accounting for more than half of all members. It is said that the association was transformed from a tea party of the soybean and rice industry's Bianji Hakka community before the ninth year of the Republic of China. At the beginning, it was stipulated that it should be jointly established by Chinese merchants operating miscellaneous grains, oil, soybeans, and cakes in Shanghai, so it was originally named the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, Soybean, and Cake Trade Association. Internally, it is divided into six Hakka communities, totaling seven guild halls. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Local Merchants Guild Hall: Cuixiu Guild Hall (Soybean Industry)</p>
<p>2. Local Merchants Guild Hall: Rengu Guild Hall (Rice Industry)</p>
<p>3. Han Hakka (Zhicheng Guild Hall). The so-called Han Hakka does not refer to Hankou merchants traveling in Shanghai, but actually refers to merchants specializing in miscellaneous grains, soybeans, and rice between Hankou and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Shanghai, most of whom are Ningbo people from Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Hakka: Jiyuantang Guild Hall. The capital of the various merchants of this Hakka is strong, and their business is developed. In addition to miscellaneous grains, they also deal in northern and southern grains and groceries. They are now also basic members of the Miscellaneous Grain Association. However, at that time, this Hakka did not have a formal organization established, but was affiliated with the Zhicheng Guild Hall.</p>
<p>4. Guangdong Hakka: Shenshou Guild Hall. This is organized by Guangzhou grain merchants in Shanghai and is affiliated with the Guangzhao Guild Hall.</p>
<p>5. Chaozhou Hakka: Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Federation. This is organized by Chaozhou merchants in Shanghai and is different from Shenshou Hall. The business of this Hakka is not limited to miscellaneous grains, so it joins under the name of the Sugar and Grocery Federation.</p>
<p>6. Fujian Hakka: Sanshan Guild Hall. Also known as Fuzhou Hakka, it is organized by Fuzhou merchants in Shanghai. The scope of business operations of people from Fujian Province is also broad, and the miscellaneous grain industry is one part of the Sanshan Guild Hall.</p>
<p>7. Xiamen Hakka: Quanzhang Guild Hall. It is organized by Xiamen merchants in Shanghai, and the grain industry is only one part of it. After the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, various industries in Shanghai were reorganized. The association also changed its name to the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Trade Association because the original name seemed to conflict with the soybeans of the soybean and rice industry. At first, it was collected in the name of various Hakkas, with the business as the main body, so it was called member business. Now, it does not list Hakka affiliation, but only lists the representatives of the business. However, its content is still the previous Hakkas, but the soybean and rice industries have been merged, and the Zhenjiang Hakka has independently organized.</p>
<p>Businesses that specialize in or concurrently deal in miscellaneous grains and oil cakes do not completely join the public food industry. Even in terms of Hakka groups, there are still the Jiangxi Hakka Jiyi Tang Guild Hall and the Tianjin Hakka Shunzhi Guild Hall, which have not joined. Other Hakkas from various provinces and cities such as Shantou, Quanzhou, Yantai, Longkou, Haizhou, Qingdao, Yingkou, Hunan, Sichuan, Dalian, and Anhui have also not joined. Foreign merchants who specialize in the import and export of miscellaneous grains, rice, wheat flour, and bran, although some of them, such as British and Japanese firms, also have great influence and have frequent dealings with Chinese merchants, they all trade in the name of foreign firms or individuals. They have their own commercial organizations, so they do not join Chinese commercial organizations.</p>
<p>2. Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Retail Trade Association. This is jointly organized by retail miscellaneous grain stores and a part of brokers. It specializes in selling by the "dou" measure and does not engage in wholesale, which is similar to the Rice Number Trade Association of the rice industry. The scope of this industry is smaller than rice stores, and it is often concurrently operated by rice stores. It was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China and has many members, but they are very scattered. The address is No. 2, Cuifeng Lane, Doushi Street. The current chairman of the committee is Mr. Sun Jiaoyun.</p>
<p>3. Shanghai Grain, Miscellaneous Oil, and Cake Exchange Broker Association. This association is a combination of the same nature as the Flour Exchange Broker Association, that is, the group of brokers in the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange. The quota of brokers in the exchange is 100, which is more than flour brokers; but in fact, it is not full. The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange was founded by soybean, rice, and miscellaneous grain merchants, and brokers are also mostly filled by soybean, rice, and miscellaneous grain merchants, so it seems to be more stable than flour brokers. However, its business is not very developed, and its activity has been far less than that of flour brokers in recent years. The current chairman and vice chairman of the committee are Mr. Chuan Changyu and Mr. Xue Chengzhang. The members, trainees, staff, and workers of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange have also organized the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange Trade Union. This association is similar to the Flour Exchange Staff Association; but this one has a wider range of workers and has survived until now after several reorganizations. Its organization is in accordance with trade union regulations, so it is of a trade union nature rather than a commercial combination.</p>
<p>4. Shanghai Oil Mill Trade Association. This association is the Oil Mill Association, which is organized by various machine oil mills. However, there are very few oil mills in Shanghai, and the organization of the products is neither as grand and rigorous as the various factories in the Northeast, nor as numerous as the inland oil workshops. The raw materials for oil production are soybeans, floral cores, and peanuts, rapeseed, etc. are also often used. Among them, the operators are divided into Guangdong Hakka and Zhejiang Hakka. Common products on the market, such as soybean oil, raw oil (peanut oil), clear oil (floral core oil), as well as soybean cakes, floral cakes, peanut cakes, etc., are mostly produced by Lide, Dayou, Dachang, Feng, Dadexin, Shenghelong, and Juchanghe factories. Rapeseed oil and rapeseed cakes are mostly manufactured by inland workshops, and Shanghai factories do not pay attention to them. Sesame oil is made by small grinders, and factories have gradually paid attention to this recently. The address is No. 105, Jiangxi Road, and the current chairman of the committee is Mr. Zhu Jingan.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Ministry of Education Orders Vocational Schools to Focus on Off-Campus Internships and Cooperate with Construction Agencies <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 26th) The Ministry of Education ordered the education administrative agencies of various provinces and cities that the Ministry has found that the knowledge and skills learned by graduates of various provincial industrial schools at school do not fully meet the needs of actual work, making it difficult to gain the trust of the industry. The reason is that the teaching curriculum of vocational schools still needs to be improved, and the internship equipment is not perfect, resulting in various work skills being impure, and the lack of off-campus internship opportunities. Students cannot have full contact with the industry, which is the biggest problem. In addition to repeatedly sending personnel to inspect and guide, and ordering to increase funding to enrich equipment and improve teaching, the Executive Yuan has also approved orders to various ministries, committees, departments, provincial and municipal governments, and sub-messages to the National Economic Commission, etc., to instruct industrial, commercial, health, transportation and other construction agencies to allow vocational school students of the same nature to practice as much as possible. On the one hand, vocational school students can gain practical experience and increase work efficiency, and on the other hand, they can communicate supply and demand needs and cultivate talents suitable for social production. Five guidelines for cooperation between vocational schools and construction agencies have been formulated. You are instructed to order the public and private vocational schools under your jurisdiction to discuss with the construction agencies of the same nature as the school and draw up detailed off-campus internship measures for students. Report to the office for approval and implementation, and at the end of each semester, compile and summarize the internship overview of each school and report to the department for review.</p>

<p>Chen Lijiang has returned from his inspection of education in Sichuan Province. His impressions of the inspection were briefly reported in this newspaper. Now, the Ministry of Education has released a formal report, instructing the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education as follows: "According to the report on his inspection of education in the province submitted by Chen Lijiang, Special Inspector of the Ministry, it has been reviewed and the points requiring improvement in the province are hereby printed and shown as follows:"</p>
<p>1.  Regarding Elementary School Education: (1) The existing number of elementary schools in the province has not yet been statistically determined. The department should promptly investigate the current status of elementary schools throughout the province, compile statistics on elementary schools throughout the province, and formulate a multi-year plan as the basis for improvement. (2) The six-year elementary schools in the province are mostly concentrated in cities. Rural elementary schools are all single-level or complexly structured primary elementary schools. For the sake of balanced development of urban and rural elementary schools, the department should immediately close elementary schools in cities with few graduates and relocate them to rural areas, or use county funds to operate or subsidize rural elementary schools. (3) The province and each county and city should organize elementary education research associations and use winter and summer vacations to hold elementary school teacher training courses. The department should also hire elementary education experts and implement a guidance system to improve the qualifications of elementary school teachers. (4) Most elementary schools in the province start in the spring, but the textbooks used are for the autumn semester. The content of the teaching materials is often inconsistent with the seasons. The starting class in spring should be gradually changed to the starting class in autumn, or books for the starting class in spring should be used. (5) Provincial elementary schools should be opened in Wanxian, Chongqing, Jiading, and Ya'an as a model for nearby counties to improve their elementary schools. Chongqing is densely populated, and the existing elementary schools are insufficient. The city should properly raise funds and build more elementary schools. (6) For the purpose of improving elementary school education in Sichuan, the newly established Provincial Chengdu Experimental Elementary School should be expanded and conduct serious experiments. In accordance with previous orders, the school should jointly lead the improvement of elementary education in Sichuan Province with the Chongqing Private Bashu Elementary School. At the same time, elementary school teachers throughout the province should be ordered to visit and learn from it in order to achieve the effect of observation.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding Compulsory Education: (1) Only half of the counties and cities in the province have established short-term elementary schools. Those that have not yet been established should be ordered to open them immediately to comply with the regulations. (2) The department should instruct all counties and cities to make the promotion of compulsory education and the establishment of short-term elementary schools the central task of educational administration and actively carry it out. (3) The should quickly dispatch provincial inspectors, etc., to guide and supervise the counties and cities, and assess their performance. (4) The department should inform all counties and cities that the funds for short-term elementary schools that have been included in the budget must be properly raised, sources must be determined, and they must be disbursed on schedule. (5) The 140,000 yuan in initial assistance funds allocated to the province by the central government and the 150,000 yuan in subsidies allocated by the provincial government should be quickly allocated and distributed to the counties and cities on a monthly basis to facilitate the process. (6) Chongqing has a dense population and many out-of-school children. The city should be ordered to open the planned short-term elementary schools as soon as possible. Regarding funding, the city should quickly raise funds. If there are insufficient funds, subsidies should be considered.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding Secondary Schools and Normal Education: (1) Jointly established secondary schools in the province should be considered for transfer to provincial management. There are too many county-established secondary schools. They should be appropriately merged or converted into normal schools or vocational schools. (2) Private secondary schools in the province urgently need to be reorganized. The Department of Education must formulate specific measures for implementation and formulate measures to subsidize excellent private secondary schools in order to encourage them. (3) The Department of Education should immediately organize a provincial secondary school building and equipment management committee. Its functions are to design and determine the construction plan of secondary schools throughout the province and promote its implementation, as well as to unify the investigation and purchase of equipment in secondary schools, with the goal of starting, supervising, and improving in the near future. (4) For secondary schools and normal schools, if the ratio of full-time to part-time teachers does not meet the regulations, it should be corrected immediately. The list of faculty and staff of each school should be prepared by the principal from qualified personnel and submitted to the Education Department for approval, and then the principal should hire them. (5) Secondary schools and normal schools should strictly abide by the course standards and revised timetable promulgated by the Ministry of Education. They must not arbitrarily add or subtract subjects or increase or decrease class hours. (6) Science experiments should be supervised by teachers and students should do it themselves and submit a detailed report. (7) There is no need to set up checkers at the school exits. Detailed measures should be formulated for students entering and leaving the school based on the situation of boarding and commuting, and strictly enforced by the training staff. (8) The should divide the province into normal school districts, make overall plans to train teachers for moral education, and should set up a provincial rural normal school with an experimental area for rural education. (9) The buildings of the Provincial Chongqing Women's Normal School are narrow and urgently need to be rebuilt or relocated. (10) Female teachers should be employed more in women's normal schools. (11) More time should be given to teaching practice, and its implementation should be supervised. (12) Full-time teachers should live in the school to effectively manage it.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding Vocational Education: (1) The province should follow the regulations of the "Ministry's Standards for the Establishment and Funding Distribution of Secondary Schools" when conducting vocational education, distributing ratios, and based on the province's economic construction situation, hire experts to organize a vocational education design committee to formulate a detailed plan for the future development of vocational education. (2) Most of the existing vocational schools are concentrated in Chengdu and Chongqing. Future expansions should pay attention to popularizing them throughout the province. (3) The equipment in each school is still too simple. The expense should be increased in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the Revised Vocational School Regulations. (4) Each school should have a director of practice. Experienced technicians should be hired for each subject to provide practical guidance, and the practice time should be increased. (5) Each school should strive to closely connect with industrial institutions and allow students to practice in the field. (6) In addition to learning agricultural technology, agricultural students should also pay attention to rural economic knowledge, such as cooperatives, warehouse management, and rural loans. (7) There are too many part-time teachers in each school, and strict orders should be given to improve this. (8) The majors in the Provincial Chengdu and Chongqing Women's Vocational Schools are too mixed and should be reorganized immediately. (9) Each school should be equipped with vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes that meet local needs. The above points must be followed and improved, and the handling situation should be reported for future reference. This order.</p>

<p>Sports News: Our Country's Davis Cup Representative, Mr. Xu Chengji, Departed the Country Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and his wife traveled with him. Cai Huiquan boarded the ship in Hong Kong. The Davis Cup Preliminary Round will Begin on May 5th, with the First Encounter Being France.</p>
<p>For the 1936 Davis Cup International Tennis Tournament, after our country decided to appoint Mr. Xu Chengji and Zheng Zhaojia as representatives, Zheng went directly to Paris across the Atlantic from the United States. Xu arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 12th of this month and defeated the local Western star Carson twice with scores of three to one and three to zero. He departed the country yesterday afternoon at 11:00 a.m. with Mr. and Mrs. Lin Baohua, former representatives of our country's Davis Cup, who are going to France at their own expense. Those who saw him off included Mrs. Tan Lao and Lin Xianjin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Our Country Joins the European Zone</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu, the number of countries participating in the Davis Cup in the previous session reached thirty units, while in this session there were only twenty-three countries. There are fifteen countries participating in the European zone. In fact, there are only four countries competing in the American zone. Our country used to join the American zone and has now entered the European zone at the same time as Argentina. Because of the Davis Cup rules, any country can freely participate in the European and American zones without absolute restrictions. The preliminary selection has now been abolished, which has indeed made it easier for most countries. However, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand, and Italy have stopped attending for various reasons, reducing the interest. Among the nineteen countries participating in the European zone, Germany and the Czech Republic have been the most promising in the past. The results of the competition will likely form a three-way situation. The drawing ceremony for the Davis Cup tennis in this session was held on February 3 at the Egyptian Pavilion of the Earl of Ho's residence in London, hosted by London Mayor Vincent De, and was extremely grand.</p>
<p>Our Country's First Battle Is Against France</p>
<p>As a result of the draw, the first week of byes and matches will be Morocco, the Netherlands, China, France, Spain, and Germany. The remaining Argentina, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Ireland will all have byes. The match dates will be the first week starting on May 5, the second week on May 17, the third week on June 9, and the fourth week on June 19. The European Zone finals will be on July 13, and the Inter-Zone will be on July 18, 20, and 21 for three days. The championship will be held in Wimbledon on July 25, 27, and 28 for three days. The order of the first and second weeks is as follows:</p>
<p>European Zone</p>
<p>(First Week)</p>
<p>Morocco vs. Netherlands</p>
<p>China vs. France</p>
<p>Spain vs. Germany</p>
<p>(Second Week)</p>
<p>Norway vs. Belgium</p>
<p>Austria vs. Poland</p>
<p>Yugoslavia vs. Czech Republic</p>
<p>Winner of Morocco vs. Netherlands vs. Winner of China vs. France</p>
<p>Winner of Spain vs. Germany vs. Hungary</p>
<p>Greece vs. Argentina</p>
<p>Denmark vs. Switzerland</p>
<p>American Zone</p>
<p>(First Week)</p>
<p>United States vs. Mexico</p>
<p>Cuba vs. Australia</p>
<p>(Second Week)</p>
<p>Winner of US vs. Mexico vs. Winner of Cuba vs. Australia</p>
<p>Cai Huiquan Leaves Hong Kong for a Stopover Tomorrow</p>
<p>Xu continued, "This time I was sent to Europe. As a result of the draw, unfortunately, we first encountered France, which is a great pity. England and France are the hegemons in the European zone. Although France has not won the Inter-Zone finals for two years, the male phoenix still exists. Moreover, the English general Pan Lai was injured in the shoulder when he attended the singles championship finals last year, and it has become increasingly serious recently. Even a slight gesture is inconvenient, which gives France a great opportunity. France will not easily let go of this opportunity, so it makes myself and Mr. Zheng even more difficult. However, we are not discouraged and will continue to work hard to repay our countrymen. Mr. Cai Huiquan returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday to take care of personal matters and is scheduled to board a ship in Hong Kong tomorrow to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Lin Shihua and myself on the same boat to Europe. Mr. Zheng Zhaojia telegraphed the other day, saying that he would depart from the United States in about a week, cross the Atlantic, and meet in Paris in mid-May."</p>

<p>Shanghai and North China Football Players to Go South on April 1st. Two League Matches to be Held in Hong Kong to Select Official Representatives.</p>
<p>The World Games football preliminary selection was previously decided to be held in Hong Kong. Seven people were selected from Shanghai and North China, and were scheduled to take the Titi and Shaten steamships south on April 1. Selection committee member Dr. Rong Qizhao, representing the National Sports Association of China, went to Hong Kong ahead of schedule to negotiate everything. Rong departed yesterday afternoon at 11:00 a.m. on the Italian postal ship Victoria.</p>
<p>According to Rong, the football players participating in the World Games preliminary selection total thirty people, and the Hong Kong side will register them with the Hong Kong Football Association to participate in the league. The Saint Team is scheduled to play the Hong Kong Army United Team on April 18 and the Mixed Team on the 19th. In these two matches, the individual performance of each player will be assessed, and the final twenty-two will be selected as official representatives. The purpose of my trip is to go to Hong Kong ahead of schedule to and negotiate everything. I plan to meet with the Shanghai and North China players in Hong Kong and will stay for about three weeks. Then, I will return to Shanghai with the finally selected representatives. When the representatives arrive in Shanghai, they will play against the local strong teams for three days on April 25, 26, and 29. The teams participating in the competition are still under negotiation. In order to give all the players more opportunities to practice, they are scheduled to take the Qionglabote round to go abroad on May 2, passing through the South Pacific Islands, where it is estimated that there will be about twenty matches. Those that have been negotiated are in West Guan, Singapore, Benan, Medan, and Rangoon, where there will be two matches in each place. There will be nine matches in Java, and another match in Calcutta. The Victoria round will set sail at 11:00 a.m. and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning. Shen Liang, the executive director of the Sports Association, also went to the port yesterday to see them off. According to Shen, the track and field, swimming, basketball, boxing, and weightlifting athletes and staff who will be attending the World Games must be sent abroad in mid-June.</p>

<p>Zhang Yingda, a famous shooting master in our country, defeated Hu Changyuan with one thousand points to five hundred seventy-nine in the second week of the amateur shooting high-level competition, and the call for the championship has greatly increased. According to experts, the champion of this high-level competition will be among Zhang Yingda, Englishman Bernal, and Portuguese Medina, as the shooting king Li Gonghao has retired and is living in seclusion. Clark vs. Medina today.</p>
<p>Encountering Adversity: Hu Changyuan is one of the new good players. He often roams with the shooting king Li Gongying, and his shooting layout has obviously improved under Li's guidance. He was quite invigorated at the beginning of yesterday's competition. However, once he encountered adversity, he could not maintain his calm will. This is a phenomenon that should occur when his combat experience is not yet sufficient. The upper and lower innings were better in the upper inning. There was a lot of excitement at the beginning, but after entering, he was shocked by the other party's excellent skills, and he could not express his original good skills, resulting in a huge loss of 421 points in the one-thousand-point situation. Highest points: 36, 2, 30, 34, 13.</p>
<p>Excellent Performance: Zhang Yingda's performance yesterday was extremely satisfactory. His hand is more skilled than in previous years. He is very good at sending red and self-falling victories and other shooting techniques. At that time, the shooting king Li Gongying was also watching from the sidelines and praised him greatly. It is not known whether his ball skills have surpassed him. He took the lead in the first half with 500 points to 342 points. In the second half, he was successful in everything and won with a thousand points to five hundred seventy-nine. Highest scores: 210, 25, 63, 30, 36, 35, 35, 22, 38, 38, 49, 24, 48, 62, 46.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Cotton Yarn Prices Soar <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>—Spot and Forward Prices All Exceed Fifty Dollars—</p>
<p>The cotton market has soared, and the situation is unusually firm. This is because cotton inventories are low, and financial firms and banks have uniformly closed off a large amount of spot cotton. The Japanese firm, Toyo Cotton Company, also took in more than 10,000 piculs of March cotton. Spot and forward cotton prices are all rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Open Flower Closing Jumps Sharply</p>
<p>The opening market for open flower futures saw increases across all months. Because the bulls in the near months were rumored to have organized a company to prepare for a squeeze, buying was especially strong, and the upward momentum was particularly intense. Aiji also came in to drag up prices. However, U.S. cotton rose by one to eight points, and Indian cotton fell by 0.5 to 2 rupees due to sales by European exporters. Nevertheless, market buyers were enthusiastic. As a result, all months rose by 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening market situation was extremely sharp. The availability of chips was very scarce. There were rumors of bullish news. Tongji continued to absorb cotton, and the price increase became even more intense. By closing, the far months were jumping 3 jiao, and all months had risen beyond the $5 mark. As a result, all months rose by 2, 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,600 piculs by Xiesheng, 3,500 piculs by Dafu, 3,900 piculs by Jinchang, 2,500 piculs by Senkang, 2,700 piculs by Changfeng, 1,100 piculs by Yikang, 1,300 piculs by Ruiyuan, 1,600 piculs by Dafeng, 2,900 piculs by Daji, 1,700 piculs by Yuanyi, and 2,000 piculs by Hengchang. Purchases included 1,100 piculs by Yichang, 1,200 piculs by Runkang, 2,400 piculs by Hexing, 1,900 piculs by Jifeng, 2,600 piculs by Meiji, 4,000 piculs by Tongji, 1,600 piculs by Gengfeng, 2,000 piculs by Shengyuan, 3,000 piculs by Changhe, 3,300 piculs by Yuda, and 2,300 piculs by Mingde. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e152">Yarn Market Follows Raw Cotton Upward <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>—August Futures Re-emerge Above the $210 Mark—</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been weak for four days in a row, suddenly reported an increase today. This was truly due to relaxed financing and the firm intention of the banking sector to absorb supply. Yesterday, the sellers of the March futures were delivering cotton, which was fully accepted by the buyers. At the same time, raw cotton prices jumped, causing the bullish trend in the market to reignite. August futures re-emerged above the $210 mark. If customer sales can continue to come in, the future outlook is certainly optimistic.</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere in the Spun Yarn Market</p>
<p>The opening market for spun yarn futures saw a gradual rise in all months. Although the sellers were under pressure to deliver yesterday, the financial sector fully accepted the deliveries, and market sentiment saw a turnaround. Sellers were scarce, and the market price gradually rose. As a result, all months rose by 9 jiao to 1 yuan and 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening market, the sentiment remained tense. The trading floor felt particularly dry. This was because Hexing came in to make a large amount of offsetting purchases. The market price moved forward steadily. This was truly because the soaring cotton market dragged the interdependent yarn market into a better situation. As a result, all months continued to rise by 3, 4, and 6 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 650 bales by Deda, 1,200 bales by Dafu, 500 bales by Yuda, 2,050 bales by Daji, 1,000 bales by Jinchang, 1,150 bales by Senkang, 450 bales by Yichang, and 400 bales by Yongchang. Purchases included 1,500 bales by Meiji, 4,300 bales by Hexing, 1,000 bales by Shenji, 1,400 bales by Changfeng, 500 bales by Xiecheng, 700 bales by Changyu, 1,050 bales by Shengyuan, and 500 bales by Hengchang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Clear, Prices Rise</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. It is found that statistics for all bands bought today total only three hundred and eighty-five bales. Prices rose one yuan or so. The purchasing amount of each band is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">US Cotton Futures All Rise, Spot Goods Fall One Cent <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the US cotton market opened, each month fluctuated one or two cents. Both buyers and sellers concentrated on midday. The final price for March was 10.05 cents. The final supply of the cotton storage office is estimated to be around 10,000 bales. Other months weakened due to bulls closing and short-selling. Old cotton also weakened due to sales by foreign merchants. New cotton was firm due to purchases by the industry and short-sellers, but not much was traded. From now on, market sentiment will focus on May and whether the cotton storage office will throw out more cotton. The closing was firm. Spot fell one cent, futures rose two to eight points. British cotton spot unchanged, futures fell one or two points. Indian cotton was bought by retail investors and sold by European exporters. Flat cotton fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Oomra fell 1.5 to 2 rupees, Whiter cotton fell 1 rupee, raw electricity is recorded on the left (25th electric).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay report, the opening forecast for 26th White Cotton was 196 rupees, up 1 rupee from the previous day's close.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Food: Rumors of Conflict Between Japan and Russia, Flour and Wheat Suddenly Rebound <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a phenomenon of initially being flat and then jumping sharply. The quoted price of foreign wheat was around two jiao lower in Chicago and four or eight cents lower in Canada. When the price was opened, due to the good weather, although market sentiment was weak, because the factory did not hedge and many outsiders were long, the distant futures had fallen nearly two jiao from the highest level of the previous week, so buying was strong. The market gradually rose steadily. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month suddenly turned tight, and the price rose quite quickly. Due to rumors of conflict between Japan and Russia and various domestic circumstances, the attention of the bulls was aroused. Near-term contracts rose by two cents, while far-term contracts rose by three or four cents. It is feared that the potential for speculation will grow, leading to unpredictable situations.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market was flat to steady in the morning after opening, and then expensive in the afternoon. Initially, the weather was clear, and the opening price was similar to the previous one. Later, the flour market turned firm, and prices rose by two or three cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, there were not many transactions in the current month, and it remained stable. Distant futures were shaken by rumors in the market, and short positions became restrained. The opening price rose step by step, reversing up by seven or nine cents to one jiao compared to the previous day. Industry insiders speculate that because the current price difference between old and new wheat is around one yuan, outside buyers may be using this as a ratio, so future changes cannot be predicted for the time being. The spot wheat market remains stable. The opening price of Yao Bay Suqian wheat was $5.32, with over a thousand bags taken by Fuxin.</p>
<p>It is speculated that the overseas wheat market harvest this year will reach 800 million bushels. The meteorological station predicts that the southwest weather will continue to improve. The bulls are very disappointed. The stomach of the flour mills is not healthy, causing market sentiment to be difficult to revitalize.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Thin Rice Still Relies on Sales to Northern Gangs <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various gangs arrived with a total of more than 30 boats (nearly 7,000 shi of cargo), mostly thin rice. Fortunately, the Qingdao gang and others still had a strong intention to buy, with more than 3,000 bags, so the thin rice market was able to show promise. High-quality goods added 3 jiao, and medium-quality goods rose by 8 jiao. As for thick early japonica rice, sales were weak, so although not much cargo arrived, the market was stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan showed no prosperity.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 30 boats arrived from various gangs in Hexia. The market was weak for all goods. The price of high-quality white japonica rice softened by 4 or 5 fen, the price of medium goods was 1 jiao short, Yin Yuan was a small jiao outside, and the price of Bian Yuan was 6 or 7 fen short. The price of thin rice was a small 5 or 6 fen. The goods at the top of the early rice were phlegmy. The price of old goods was nearly a foot short, and other colors also showed a soft trend.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Customer Xian Rice Arrived and Sold Equally, Rumors of Two Boats of Logistics Rice Being Ordered by Tianjin Gangs <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Transactions were slight. The Tong City only opened two hundred and eighty bags of Logistics high-quality broken rice. Other machine rice were all held by the warehouses, and there were no transactions for a long time. The customers' sales are sluggish, and the customer is restrained, so the market price is difficult to improve. Yesterday, there was a rumor on the market that the Dajin gang in Shen Ding had settled two boats of Siamese broken rice, which were unloaded in Tianjin. If so, the sales of broken rice to the north will be reduced, and the market will be more difficult to recover.</p>
<p>(Customer Xian) Yesterday, the arrival and sales were even, and the market was also stable. The Quanzhou gang continued to sell more than 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine rice, and the market on this street was still active. The Tong City opened 3,300 bags of Gan rice, 867 bags of Wintai rice, 100 bags of Zhenjiang rice, and 50 bags of Anqing rice. In addition to the Fuzhou office taking over 1,000 bags of Gan rice, all of them were taken in by this street.</p>

<p>Although the overseas silver market rose quite a bit yesterday, its footing was quite weak. In addition, large players took advantage of the low prices to vigorously cover their positions. Buying in the market was still active. After an initial drop, it rose, and in the end, there was no change.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Business Securities Exchange launched the May futures. When the market opened, the May futures of the five unified government bonds were actually all traded. The May futures of Class B had more transactions. The lottery only involved Class A and B. The May futures were all ex-interest, and the listed market prices of near-term and far-term contracts were not much different. Arbitragers were still insufficient to pay commissions, so arbitrage transactions were still hopeless. The previously existing small part of arbitrage transactions were all traded off-market and were not closely related to the market price. Therefore, there was still no sign of market activity. Yesterday, although May had been launched and each month had been opened, the transactions had not improved. It was really a rare occurrence to find noteworthy entries and exits on the market. The trend mostly hovered between 5 fen and 1 jiao. Only the 4th-month futures of Class D rose by 2 jiao in the afternoon opening, which was already a rare occurrence. The rest were shrouded in an atmosphere of depression, and the coldness of the market made people deeply feel the contrast between the past and the present. Even the market price results for the day, due to the narrow range of ups and downs, were still a mixture of highs and lows, still with a difference of 5 fen and 1 jiao. Only the current month of Class D rose by 2.5 jiao, which was the most. The total transaction volume for April and May was 1,745,000 yuan. The results of the ups and downs are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Arnhold Trading Company purchased 20 20/22 denier Dayu brand white mill silk futures for July for $702.50 because the price was low. Other manufacturers and foreign firms did not follow suit, and sales of silk fabrics in various regions were still smooth, even outstripping supply. For example, the B-brand white mill silk, Tonghe, etc., 20/22 denier, had already been sold for a new high price of 840 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>The system of weights and measures for Qimen black tea has always been extremely complex. Some use 18-liang scales, and some use 20-liang scales, causing disputes between tea farmers and tea shops from time to time. It is now heard that the Qimen Tea Industry Association, in order to respect the central government's decrees, convened meetings with various trading houses and decided to change to using kilograms from this year onwards. This has been notified and implemented. However, regarding the progress of business, the trading houses in both Qimen and De have not developed much. In Fuliang, seven or eight tea estates have been newly established, and the situation is more lively.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market initially softened due to reports from Dalian, compounded by expectations of deliveries on previously ordered long-distance shipments. Consequently, sellers were inclined to offer discounts, causing prices to fall by 2.1 cents compared to the previous market session. However, this trend reversed as standard near-term oil prices increased, triggering buying activity and pushing market prices back up by several cents. Market sentiment is reported to be tight.</p>
<p>Hankou Tung Oil Surges for Days - Foreign Firms Replenish Orders, Market Price Rises by Ten Yuan - Zhejiang Tung Follows Suit, Shanghai Market Situation Tightens</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, when Hankou white tung oil began to be sought after by foreign firms, the market has gradually soared. Prices stabilized around mid-month after most firms had completed their purchases for the month. Unexpectedly, a significant amount for April remained unfulfilled. The foreign firms initially anticipated abundant supply as spring approached and the river waters rose. However, the Yangtze River upstream remained shallow, causing significant delays in water transport. Arrivals in Hankou dwindled, and with delivery deadlines approaching, firms were compelled to bid up prices. Demand far exceeded supply, becoming increasingly apparent. In the past week, foreign firms in Hankou have been scouring the market, willing to pay any price to secure available stock. The market has witnessed a surge, with prices rising from 62-63 yuan per dan daily, escalating multiple times each day. This week, prices have reached 66.5 yuan. In the last two or three days, the price increase has intensified. Two days ago, the price stood at 68.5 yuan, but yesterday's telegram reported a rise to 71 yuan, and today's telegram indicates 73.5 yuan, with the situation remaining tight. In just ten days, the price has risen by more than ten yuan, which is quite alarming. However, the situation has yet to stabilize, and it is possible that prices may reach 80 yuan in the near future. Rumors suggest that Hankou foreign firms have a shortage of two to three thousand tons for April delivery, which must be fully replenished before mid-April, resulting in a critical shortage of spot goods. From the reporter's observations, the price surge is entirely driven by speculative buying. Once the frenzy subsides, there may be a period of consolidation, but with the base price now high, any correction is unlikely to be excessive. For the past two months, Zhejiang tung oil has been cheaper than Hankou tung oil. With the surge in Hankou tung oil prices, Zhejiang tung oil has followed suit. Yesterday, the market price for Zhejiang tung oil for Jiangxi delivery was 70 yuan per *chu*, and most local export merchants found it difficult to secure stock, making the situation even more tense than in Hankou.</p>

The exchange set the price for second to fourth-grade granulated white sugar spot at 22.05 yuan, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. Re-export sugar was at 7 yuan, with few buyers. East Red remained unchanged. East White continued its downward trend, with eighth-grade spot at 21.70 yuan and ninth-grade at 21.50 yuan, both down 0.05 yuan. Fourth-grade spot traded slightly at 22.05 yuan, down 0.10 yuan. Re-export was at 7.10 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Local factory cotton white was stable, Zhen Ji first-grade at 20.70 yuan, second to fifth-grade as per regulations. The graded plate only saw the Chaozhou traders offer ordinary branch red at 12.70 yuan, ordinary branch foreign at 13.25 to 13.20 yuan, with a total of over two hundred bags traded.

<p>The initial price for the spring market of bitter apricot kernels was only 22-23 yuan. Later, due to scarce inventory and strong demand from the medicine traders, the asking price gradually rose by ten yuan. Currently, new arrivals are increasing, totaling over two hundred bags.

<p>The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank previously published the production index for September of the 24th year [of the Republic]. The indexes for November and December of last year have now been published, showing that, starting from September, with the exception of wheat flour, the production volume of other industries consistently increased month by month. In December, due to the year-end, the index generally showed a slight contraction. Among them, the reduction in cement production was particularly significant, only reaching 45% of the production volume of November, mainly because the Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory was affected by political factors, and its production was not included in the calculations. The overall production index for the entire year of last year was still similar to the previous two years. Considering November and December, the production situation, with the exception of cement, all showed a forward step compared to before the currency reform. See the table below for a trial.</p>

<p>6. Cash Reserve and Silver Movement</p>
<p>The inventory of Shanghai Chinese and foreign banks has averaged over 400 million yuan per month since September of the 21st year of the Republic. As mentioned in Section 2 of this article, the reason why the call loan market was weak in the three years prior to the 23rd year of the Republic, averaging no more than 10 cents or more per month (see the Shanghai Call Rate Fluctuation Table), was due to the excessive abundance of silver reserves. However, starting in August of the 23rd year of the Republic, influenced by the American silver policy, cash outflow was rampant, and inventories decreased monthly. The total average at the end of the 23rd year of the Republic was 502.773 million yuan. In January of last year, the total inventory was only 335.08 million yuan, a decrease of over 167 million yuan. Therefore, the emptiness of Shanghai's inventory last year was unseen in the past five or six years. The monthly total was always below 330 million yuan, never exceeding this number. This is the source of the tight money supply and credit contraction. See the table below.

<h3 id="e173">On the Hu Zhongzao Poetry Case <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>I once wrote an article called "Literary Inquisition," which involved Hu Zhongzao. I believed that Hu was a thoroughgoing slave and would never harbor ethnic prejudices. Later, I saw another article on the same topic. The author believed that although Hu Zhongzao did not have "ethnic color," his poems "had quite a bit of anti-Qing thought and mocked and cursed wonderfully." He cited poems such as "The Qing wind does not know words, why does it turn the books in disorder?" "The Ming Dynasty will spread its wings and fly to Qingdu in one fell swoop," and "I see the Emperor of the Great Ming today, let's put Hu'er aside for now."</p>
<p>Hu Zhongzao's *Jianmo Sheng Poetry Collection* is probably impossible to find now, so we have no way of knowing the facts inside. However, from the imperial edicts of the Qianlong Emperor, we can still see the excerpted verses. The first thing that Qianlong considered rebellious was the book title, saying: "Jianmo comes from the Analects of Confucius, and the grinding mentioned by Confucius refers to Buddhism. Hu Zhongzao uses this as his title, what is his intention!" As for the excerpted verses, I will now copy them below and briefly explain the reasons why Qianlong considered them rebellious.</p>
<p>(1) "A world without sun and moon," "Also descend a world of spring, summer, autumn, and winter" -- Qianlong believed that since the Qing Dynasty established its rule, it has been peaceful and prosperous, far surpassing the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties. To say that another world has descended shows a lack of human heart.</p>
<p>(2) "A handful of heart to discuss turbidity Qing" -- putting the word "turbid" on the dynastic title.</p>
<p>(3) "Heaven did not open Qingtai," "Civilization wants to be covered by barbarians," "Please look at all Angbei when we meet, who knows that the beauty belongs to the fur-clad people?" -- pointing out that he picked at the differences between Han and Manchu.</p>
<p>(4) "The Southern Dipper sends me south, the Northern Dipper sends me north, the space between the Southern and Northern Dippers is not even a millet wide," "Sail again across the Xiang River towards the North Sea, look closely at how it came to be," "Intend to unveil the Northern Dipper, angrily exhaust the southern wind," "Temporarily rest the southern wind" -- criticizing him for repeatedly separating the north and south.</p>
<p>(5) "Emperor Mu of the Zhou Dynasty, his carriages and horses never stopped," "Emperor Wu lost his city for beauty," "White snow is difficult to harmonize, a single word of praise cannot be added" -- because the wording and allusions used were irrelevant to the poem's topic, pointing out that it contained malicious satire.</p>
<p>(6) "Old Buddha has no illness now, but the court hears that the gate is not open" -- spreading rumors.</p>
<p>(7) "Is there no vital energy in the world?" "Not for sightseeing indulge the thieves," "After the three talents are born, there is today" -- the meaning of the words is rebellious.</p>
<p>(8) "The heaven that is illuminated is all sun and moon, the earth has no way to measure west and east, all the dukes of the Five Mountains, all the dukes of rivers, have been similar in the past hundred years," "King Zhou only goes according to the times" -- the former implies that the mountains and rivers are ashamed, the latter uses the story of King Zhao's southern expedition, with malicious satire.</p>
<p>(9) "Also the son of heaven, also wearing Laiyi," "Now it is also a Tushan meeting, and the jade and silk are ten times more" -- the three "also" words are "extremely disrespectful."</p>
<p>(10) "Blue flies throw themselves into the dung, how can they refuse to speak?" "That is a partial disaster and rain is falling now, just like the Buddha lighting lamps on weekdays" -- the first sentence mocks listening to slanderous words, and the last two sentences mock not providing disaster relief.</p>
<p>(11) "Beside the flowers, I feel that a single flower has no stalk," "Her husband is my father, and his wife is also the way of the mother," "The female ruler and the ruler are one body, how can it be as deep as Ao?" -- These poems are about the death of Empress Xiaoxian. To the emperor and empress, he directly calls them "her husband" and "his wife," and the term "ruler and father" is a common title for people. The ruler is more honorable than the father, but Hu's poem compares the ruler to the father, so he is mentally deranged.</p>
<p>(12) "To be spared my crown is to come out," "Who can perfect the rough jade in one lifetime? I fear that my body's pot will break," "If I can be the master, I will only break free from the reins," "A lifetime is as dizzy as a bird in a cage," "I would be ashamed of being a louse official," "Heaven is only to ask me about provincial affairs," "Today I am afraid to catch the wind," "Sneakily shoot stingrays with sand, greedy wolves spread their wings" -- These are all words of complaint.</p>
<p>The above-quoted poems were excerpted by Qianlong from Hu Zhongzao's *Jianmo Sheng Poetry Collection*, and they are the rebellious evidence that led to Hu Zhongzao's execution. However, in my opinion, Hu Zhongzao not only had no ethnic prejudices but also had no satire that could be accepted. Some of his verses were intended to show off his talent, deliberately using a few dangerous rhymes, obscure allusions, and irrelevant insertions; some were deliberately complaining, as if his great talent was being buried. As for the lines "Civilization wants to be covered by barbarians," "Who knows that the beauty belongs to the fur-clad people?" I suspect that refers to O'ertai, and it is even meant as praise.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Hu Zhongzao would not have forgotten Yeretai, and he would not have forgotten that they were also Tartars when he was corresponding with O'ertai and others every day.</p>
<p>As for the "Qing wind does not know words, why (must it) turn the books in disorder?" cited by a certain gentleman, it was written by Xu Jun, a Shujishi of the Yongzheng dynasty. "The Ming Dynasty will spread (periodically) its wings," "Fly to Qingdu in one fell swoop," "I see the Emperor of the Great Ming today (reunite again), let's put Hu'er aside for now," is from Xu Shuwei's *One-Pillar Building Poem*. They came before and after and have nothing to do with Hu Zhongzao. I don't know if this is a mistake on my father's part?</p>
<p>In fact, Hu Zhongzao had no ethnic prejudices at all, and Qianlong was clearly aware of this. The verses he extracted and the charges he made were very far-fetched, and it was clear at a glance that they were fabricated. Only the line "Remember the first gate of Xilin" was truly where Qianlong resented, and this was secretly in line with his repeated edicts prohibiting ministers from forming factions. Therefore, when Hu's case was concluded and reported, Qianlong's imperial decree dismissed ethnic entanglements and only spoke of sectarianism. In that part:</p>
<p>"Hu Zhongzao relied on his teacher's school and was willing to be a vicious dog. His poems mention slanderous tongues and blue flies, and according to his confession, they actually refer to Zhang Tingyu and Zhang Xi. It can be seen that his sectarianism is deeply rooted. Even Zhang Tingyu's use of people may not be without regarding O'ertai and Hu Zhongzao as outlaws. O'ertai and Zhang Tingyu were also unable to achieve great things because they met the Emperor Kao and me. Otherwise, what could not be done! When ministers stand in court, they should have the heart of serving the country with loyalty and dedication. If they all harbor opinions, then the petty people who rely on them will recklessly speculate and agree with each other, gradually becoming like fire and water. The evils of factionalism in ancient times all stemmed from this..."</p>
<p>Relying on his teacher's school and being willing to be a vicious dog is the true crime of Hu Zhongzao, and it is also the end of the road for the slaves I spoke of.</p>
<p>Many of the literary inquisitions of the Qing Dynasty had unspoken meanings. For example, Cha Siting's execution by Yongzheng was not because he came up with the topic "Where the people dwell," cutting off the head of the two words "Yongzheng," but because he was originally a former subordinate of Longkodo; Shen Deqian's execution by Qianlong was not because of the poem praising black peonies, "To seize red is not the correct color, different species are also called kings," but because he included poems that Qianlong replaced, tampered with, or ghostwrote in his own collection, exposing the charade. Hu Zhongzao's poetry case is just one such situation.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Peach Blossoms on the River <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>It was also such a cold spring, and it kept raining. It finally cleared up later, but the spring decreased in inverse proportion to the increase in sunny days. In idle talk, everyone regretted losing an opportunity to go for a spring outing. In Nanchang, everyone goes to Sancun to see peach blossoms every year in March, but by this time, the peach blossoms should have already faded. With the perspective of a foreigner, I argued that the peach blossoms would not fall so early. Although the production of sugarcane convinced me to admit that Nanchang's climate was earlier, I still勉强argued that this year's cold spring might produce different results. In fact, everyone originally hoped for such an excuse, but they used another reason to accompany me. I had long thought of taking a boat on the Gan River, but everyone thought this was an unheard-of absurd action and did not agree. Now, borrowing the excuse of seeing peach blossoms to take a boat ride was a suitable excuse, so we changed seeing peach blossoms to setting off for a river trip.</p>
<p>In order to have a longer water journey, we abandoned the usual pier for going to peach blossoms and instead went out of Tengwang Pavilion. There is no trace of Tengwang Pavilion, and the surrounding area has become a key area for loading and unloading goods. Assuming that those elegant scholars who lamented the sinking of ancient sites would rebuild Tengwang Pavilion, I wonder if they would be surprised to find that the scenery of "sunset glow and solitary wild ducks flying together, autumn water and the long sky sharing the same color" can never be seen again? Or would they close the building door and continue their dreamy dream of "reciting and chanting remotely, and unrestrainedly flying with inspiration"? We tried to think that in Wang Bo's time, he had to sigh, "The Orchid Pavilion is gone, and the Zize has become ruins." He didn't think that Yan Boyu's grand meeting had anything to cherish, so why should later generations cherish it for him? Looking at Baihuazhou, it has been completely renovated, but there is still no way to improve the pond water of Donghu. What is the point of all this?</p>
<p>Our budget for boarding the boat at Tengwang Pavilion failed unexpectedly. There wasn't a single boat there. The boats had all gone to the pier for seeing peach blossoms to catch business. So, we walked back along the river to that place. On the way, we saw many people returning with peach blossoms. We knew that this time's peach blossoms were set to be seen. At the pier, shouts were clamoring, "Go see peach blossoms, one dime per person to board the boat and it will leave immediately." We boarded the most convenient boat. We thought that since there were five of us in total, it would leave immediately. Unexpectedly, we had to wait until there were ten people. This boatman still didn't set sail but discussed with another boatman about transferring the passengers, with him collecting half of the fare. We knew we had been cheated. Paying a higher fare would have been fine, but we were really unwilling to be treated as commodities at the same time. Therefore, although the five people who came later were sold off and went to other boats, we stubbornly stayed on his boat, wanting him to ferry us himself. Who knew that our method was driving ourselves into an even deeper trap? We went from being commodities to advertisements. Our presence on the boat led later arrivals to misunderstand that the boat would leave soon and successively come up to become commodities. This method of exploitation really made us angry and helpless. We got off the boat to find another boat, but no one dared to agree to load us. We realized that this was meeting Zhang Shun on Xunyang River, but we still didn't believe that we were still in the Water Margin era. We returned to the original boat and negotiated with the boatman. Negotiation was really ineffective, but we, a total of five people, stood across his bow, cutting off the way for passengers to get on his boat, which made him realize the actual damage. Finally, he had to let us call the boat smoothly, and the fare was only five cents per person. For the time being, we were confident that we had overcome the difficulty. But it was really only temporary. After the boat had traveled a distance, the boatman told us that he was the one who was losing out, and we were still left with a sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>The boat was returning north, all the way to the mouth of Tengwang Pavilion, around the sandbar opposite the pavilion, and then turning into the inter-river and folding back south. There were also sparse households on the sandbar, and one of them was at the northernmost tip of the island. There were remnants of stone embankments on both sides of this island's corner, but they had been dilapidated and out of shape. I thought that there might have been a great building on this, so I asked my companions if it was Chao Wang Zhou—the Chao Wang Zhou where Tengwang Pavilion was originally located. My companions couldn't answer the name of the island but knew that Chao Wang Zhou was outside the inter-river. Then is there a river beyond Chao Wang Zhou? No one could answer, so there was no result. Even the location of the Sancun we were going to was never clarified. The boats for seeing flowers were all moored in one place, but after going ashore, we had to walk three or four miles along the river to see villages with scattered flowering trees. When asked for the place name, it was already Sancun, but when we moved forward and asked again, the villages along the way answered with the same name. It wasn't until we reached a village where there was no trace of tea stalls that we were told that it was already Liucun. According to the villagers, the best peach blossoms were actually in Qicun and Bacun. The words were probably somewhat credible, because some tourists were walking towards a more distant road, but we were walking on the way back, sitting down in a place that could be roughly considered Sancun.</p>
<p>In reality, no matter which section, there were more willows than peach blossoms. Whether on the edge of the fields, on the ponds, or on the graves, there was no lack of willow trees. Peach blossoms were all in people's yards. Peach trees are not more difficult to grow than willow trees. I don't know why people are unwilling to plant them everywhere, and I also don't know if those planted outside are not easy to preserve. People who see flowers are all happy to take some flowers back. If there are wildflowers to pick, they probably won't spend money to buy them. Flower prices are quite expensive, and few are broken off to sell to tourists. Most are just willow-woven flower baskets decorated with some flower petals. To buy whole branches of flowers, you must find a villager to break them off the tree temporarily, but tourists often refuse to sell a branch once they have decided on one. According to one companion's opinion, that branch can probably produce peaches with a far higher value, and it is not intended to raise the price. This idea was slightly confirmed from a tea stall old man. According to him, the business of peach blossoms was very good in previous years, and the income from selling tea in one season was more than ten yuan, and the flowers also sold for about ten yuan. Now the tea business is not good, so he hopes to find some compensation on the peaches. He doesn't think that the situation during the flowering season is bad, and the situation during the fruit season cannot be optimistic either.</p>
<p>There were still not few tourists this day. Although as a foreigner, I didn't feel much interest, my companions would also introduce conversations that used tourists as a topic. Among the tourists they recognized, some were women selling their youth. Seeing this while seeing peach blossoms naturally easily aroused associations, of course, eventually归入归入归入 the set of frivolous peach blossoms. So, they gradually and naturally talked about the end of spring and the withering of peach blossoms. Who is like the villagers who care about the peach tree's fruit? Most people are just waiting for the second spring.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Two Kinds of People <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Shouldering a layer of dust and a sorrowful heart, I entered the platform.</p>
<p>The southbound Blue Steel train, scheduled to depart at 3:35, was already there, emitting white smoke and the smell of coal, its hissing and booming sounds stirring up the travelers’ anxiety and melancholy. The locomotive, as if a stomach, swallowed the towering clouds, making a strange cry that drove people mad.</p>
<p>The platform was packed with voices, countless footsteps jumping back and forth. Suitcases and packages were tucked under arms. The red-vested men were, at this moment, for bread—or should I say for hazelnut bread and corn buns?—panting. The policemen were pacing back and forth with measured steps.</p>
<p>Having savored enough of the taste of farewell, I also told a lie to brush off the inquiries of friends, and then slipped out of the ancient city alone with simple luggage, like a thief, without a sigh—no, perhaps the sigh was in my heart.</p>
<p>The loudspeaker was already broadcasting, its grand tune repeating over and over again, reporting in both foreign and domestic languages. People became more frantic, the clamor pervading the clouds.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I squeezed into a third-class carriage. A lone traveler, I was stared at by some strange eyes: What's wrong, no friends to see you off?</p>
<p>Forgetting this, I circled around, looking for an empty seat.</p>
<p>I was almost disappointed. People had occupied a bench that could accommodate three or two people with their luggage. Those traveling long distances had spread out their blankets, stretching their legs, their leisurely expressions telling others: Spare your breath.</p>
<p>I put down my suitcase, preparing to stand until Tianjin. Surely, many passengers would get off there.</p>
<p>"Hey, there's space here!"</p>
<p>Startled by this seemingly familiar "Hey," a hand lightly patted my back from the left.</p>
<p>A sincere, unadorned face, warmth in its small eyes, a bald head still showing green, obviously newly shaved. A neat blue cloth gown covered a cotton robe. Comparing it to my own year-round blue overcoat, I couldn't help but blush. I turned sideways and greeted him.</p>
<p>The corners of his small eyes crinkled together, so shy. This was the unique loyalty of young people from the North, with a touch of rustic charm.</p>
<p>After learning that I was going to spend two nights on the train, this companion moved his bag to the seat opposite, muttered a few words to his companion in that seat, then turned back to me:</p>
<p>"Sit here. Two nights on the train is tough. This bench is just enough to sleep on. We're going to Dezhou, getting off at midnight." His Shandong accent pronounced "De" as "Dei." I felt a sense of familiarity. I rarely heard the Shandong accent.</p>
<p>"You should sit next to me; I don't need to lie down yet." I caught a glimpse of his companion's disgusted look. He disliked the young man meddling, forcing him to bend his outstretched legs.</p>
<p>However, the young man shook his head, as if unaccustomed to sitting on a bench with a girl, and lowered his head, twisting a white canvas money bag, playing with the string, circling it around his fingers.</p>
<p>"This is a shop assistant who spends all year behind the counter," I guessed.</p>
<p>Their conversation confirmed my guess.</p>
<p>His companion lit a cigar.</p>
<p>He was a shrewd old hand in business. Even though it was early February, with its initial warm weather, he was still wearing a fur coat over a leather jacket. As the carriage gradually warmed up, the portly merchant took off his outer coat. The young companion was pulled at the sleeve, but he indifferently allowed him to fold it, as if straightening it out.</p>
<p>"Are you in a hurry to get home after you get to Dezhou?" Sitting down, the portly merchant started chatting, apparently they had just gotten acquainted.</p>
<p>Mentioning home, the young man licked his lower lip, squinting his small eyes: "There's still fifty li to go, by animal."</p>
<p>"Isn't there a bus? Much faster!"</p>
<p>"Much faster, um," his eyes dodging the smoke rings from the portly man's mouth, "but it costs four or five mao. Hiring an animal, one baozi is more than enough. (Note: One bao gan'r is one hundred coins, about two mao according to the Northern market price.)"</p>
<p>As if unwilling to be met with the portly man's coldness, the young man continued enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"Another thing is, the bus has a set schedule, and you have to eat a meal while waiting. With a donkey, you can go anytime, saving you from going to a restaurant. That saves another four or five mao. Sigh, it's been four years since I ate a meal at home—"</p>
<p>Melancholy and the anticipation of the joy about to come collided in the young man's heart, and for a moment, he couldn't go on, smiling as he licked his lower lip.</p>
<p>"Ah, four years! I go back and forth once a month to handle goods. It's really hard work for a little bit of stinky money, so I just have to 'zheteng' (Peking slang, meaning to travel back and forth). But recently, the tea business has been okay. No matter how poor people are, they'll still drink tea—" He couldn't help but shake his bent right leg with pride. The young man's back immediately got a mud stain, but he didn't care and reached back to brush it off, continuing the topic:</p>
<p>"You must be making one or two wan a year? Our sundries shop made nearly a wan last year, but, what does it have to do with us xiao ji huo ji (shop assistants)..." The lean face turned red. This time, licking his lower lip evoked boundless indignation. "At best, we get ten or eight yuan at the end of the year. There's no hope."</p>
<p>"Take it slowly. I started with just a thousand yuan. How much salary do you get? Have you finished your apprenticeship yet?"</p>
<p>"I just finished last year. I only get—" The bald head slightly shook: "Six silver dollars a month! There's no way without capital. The family has had floods for years, and can't grow watermelons well. 'The family' still needs me to give them some money." -- Speaking of women, the young man felt shy, perhaps because it was a semi-estranged new bride after four years of separation.</p>
<p>Darkness fell. Past Tianjin, the calls of meat buns filled the windows. The lean face picked up a pile of buns, offering them to his companion. Although the portly man had already ordered a plate of egg fried rice, he accepted one out of politeness, saying he didn't have any change, pulling out a wad of banknotes from his short coat pocket, then stuffing them back in.</p>
<p>The portly merchant ate his egg fried rice, sprinkled with ham, alone, with a contented expression:</p>
<p>"It still has some taste..."</p>
<p>The shouts of newspaper vendors interrupted his praise. Holding a newspaper toward the plate of egg fried rice, the portly man nodded, tapping the waist of the blue cloth gown with his foot:</p>
<p>"Hey, excuse me, I don't have any change."</p>
<p>The young man carefully untied the tightly wound white canvas bag, gently paying ten copper coins.</p>
<p>As the lights came on, the carriage quieted down. Passengers abandoned the darkness outside the windows, falling asleep. The young man was a little tired, leaning on the back of his seat with his eyes closed, clutching his money bag and the handkerchief tied to his back containing his ticket. His simple face looked even warmer, that warmth covering up the habitual obedience and submission. He was dreaming, dreaming of home, dreaming of his wife and children, dreaming of exploitation and ruin…</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would he smile and frown by turns in his sleep? I didn't dare to move, afraid of waking him when a trace of joy floated on his brow. He still had to ride an animal home after getting off the train!</p>
<p>I don't know when the train stopped again. A sudden braking jolted me awake. The two men on the opposite seat had stood up. The lean one was helping the portly man stand up to take down his leather suitcase, wine bottle, and mirror frame... He himself only had a cloth bag and a rattan basket.</p>
<p>"Hey, I haven't paid for the egg fried rice yet. Do you have any change?"</p>
<p>The lean one hesitated, finally giving the portly man a satisfactory answer, unbuttoning his coat and taking out a small, tightly rolled package from his underwear. It was wrapped several times like a lotus leaf roll, inside were a few limited banknotes, neatly folded. He selected three single-corner bills from the middle.</p>
<p>The dish collector nodded, taking the money from the portly man.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to use your money."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, we're fellow countrymen, fellow countrymen!" The young man smiled gently.</p>
<p>I watched this companion get off the train, his shadow carrying the boxes disappearing into the midnight lights of the platform.</p>
<p>It's been a month, and that bald head and those narrow eyes are still haunting my mind. I hope life kicks away his obedience and his submission. Sheep can only be slaughtered.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Coming Day <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Jin</p>
<p>Let it transform into a thousand kinds of grotesque faces,</p>
<p>From deceit and tyranny, we grow.</p>
<p>No arrangements can deceive anyone;</p>
<p>Having lost our dreams, having lost our tears,</p>
<p>The suffocating climate should burst with a clap of thunder.</p>
<p>The coming day shall be our day,</p>
<p>The vigorous fire of anger warms our breasts, we must sing,</p>
<p>We cannot just suffer in sorrow and grief,</p>
<p>We must trample on all the new shackles of arrangements,</p>
<p>Struggle! Establish a brand new era.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Shattered Mood <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>When a person reaches a point where there are no ideals to pursue, the shattering of that mood can probably be compared to an exploding light bulb—the light before one’s eyes disappears, and in the darkness, only fragments remain that trip one up.</p>
<p>This makes me always remember what happened that afternoon.</p>
<p>Because I couldn’t find a friend I was visiting, Lao Tian and I were idly wandering around the Dapu Bridge area. After crossing the bridgehead, we both wanted to drink a few cups of wine to dilute the boredom in our hearts. So we found a wine shop on Lixie Road.</p>
<p>The wine shop had a two-bay facade. On the right was a corner-shaped counter, facing the street. On the left, against the wall, were stacked some wine jars, all of them old earthen jars covered in mud, as if they had just been taken out of a cellar, immediately reminding people of the taste of aged Shaoxing wine. Right at the part facing the steps, there was a small table with inscriptions, and someone was sitting there, engraving words with his head down.</p>
<p>We sat down at a table near the counter.</p>
<p>The owner, using a very scientific method, hammered a copper tube into the muddy head of the jar to draw the wine from the jar, but when he brought this yellow wine, there was still a drowned fly floating in it.</p>
<p>We drank wine, peeled peanuts, and chatted about everything. Life was boring. The past footsteps had nothing to commemorate. We had no plans for the future. We talked about the present, the present moment; we silently lowered our heads to the rim of the wine glass, reflecting our faces. Whenever we looked at each other, dry, bitter smiles would float on the corners of our mouths. The wine slowly dried up too!</p>
<p>Just as we were about to order another jin of Shaoxing wine, a Russian soldier sauntered over from the street. One can always imagine his appearance. Dry, bitter yellow hair like horse mane, a bloated, reddish-brown face, a suit of black, tattered clothes invariably covered in grease or mud and dust, and, as usual, dragging a pair of Chaplin-style worn-out leather shoes—this loyal soldier who, to commemorate the hell he himself created, refused to enter the heaven built for them by others, finally limped over here. He stood in front of the counter facing the street, and, for the sake of survival, abandoned his due aristocratic language and used the Shanghai language of the colonial world market, pointing to a black wine jar on the counter, saying:</p>
<p>“That one—one hundred coins!”</p>
<p>So he fished out a handful of copper coins mixed with dust from his suit pocket, like panning for gold, looking around the room extremely seriously with his blue eyes.</p>
<p>The owner, with extreme familiarity, poured him two cups of white spirits, just like he would serve the coolie boatmen on this road. I turned to Lao Tian and said:</p>
<p>"Maybe he's a general?"</p>
<p>Lao Tian nodded and took a drink. —However, he remained silent.</p>
<p>"Russian soldier! Russian soldier!" Suddenly, a call came from the left. I turned my head and saw that the inscription craftsman, who seemed to be held down by someone's large palm and could never lift his head again, this time, with a vengeful mood, had smile lines like crucian carp tails dragging out from the corners of his eyes, greeting this soldier, who might have been born a general.</p>
<p>"What is it?" He took the wine from the counter, drank it cup by cup as if drinking plain water without even frowning, then spat some saliva and said:</p>
<p>"Let's compare! Let's compare!" The craftsman said, suddenly laughing out loud.</p>
<p>"Okay! Compare! Compare!" He said, unbuttoning his suit trousers, pulling out a small thing that they originally wanted to use to maintain the aristocratic bloodline but was now aimless and dejected. He held it in one hand, shaking it up and down: the other hand pointed at the craftsman for a moment, then at the thing, as if venting some deficiency, cursing: "Niang mai min de! —Okay! Let's compare! Niang mai min de!"</p>
<p>So the proprietress and the craftsman both burst into laughter; but I, as if drenched in cold water, watched Lao Tian's lost face in the midst of the smoke and alcohol tasting of life.</p>
<p>"Niang mai min de! Niang mai bi de!" He kept mumbling, spitting out boring saliva, slowly locking up his trousers, hobbling away. But the victorious laughter in the shop continued for a long time, like cracked bamboo strips.</p>
<p>Looking at his receding figure, I thought: This kind of hero who seems to find satisfaction in being mocked by others, does anyone still remember the historical fact that he once squandered the sweat and blood of others for his own lewd pleasure? Does anyone still remember the age-old feats of using whips and bullets to play with other people's lives, obliterating the existence of others with his own laughter and joy? —However, in such a great era, as a small person, wading through the streets, spinning like dust in the wake of footsteps, showing his own powerlessness and weakness everywhere, then, perhaps there is a shadow of ourselves on him!</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Tragedy of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>The term "Overseas Chinese" has always been associated with the gleam of gold in the eyes of most people. Some people only see a few "successful" "Overseas Chinese magnates" who have returned to the country with large sums of gold and silver, displaying extraordinary pomp. As a result, donations, efforts to revitalize industry for the motherland, and even a whole host of praises such as "blessings of the motherland," shower down on these wealthy Overseas Chinese like raindrops. In the eyes of some people, wealthy Overseas Chinese have become a benevolent deity of wealth who relieves suffering and rescues people. Money is instantly exchanged for endless "worship." But beyond these very few wealthy Overseas Chinese, there are many more poor Overseas Chinese. The poverty, pain, and miserable oppression suffered by these poor Overseas Chinese are difficult to find even the faintest impression of in the eyes of those who only worship wealthy Overseas Chinese. The cries of suffering from the majority of oppressed Overseas Chinese have never shaken the eardrums of those in the motherland who only know how to worship wealthy Overseas Chinese. In fact, most of the wealthy Overseas Chinese who have already "succeeded" can be said to have struggled through countless difficulties and hardships to achieve their current status. When they were still deeply mired in the abyss of poverty and pain, no one paid any attention to them either. But when they "succeeded," in the eyes of the people of the motherland, their entire lives changed instantly. They instantly transformed from a position of poverty and helplessness into idols worshipped by all. This is because the gleam of gold has emanated from them.</p>
<p>These past few days, this newspaper has been running a serial report about the tragic plight of poor Overseas Chinese from the Fujian and Guangdong areas who have returned to the country, been deceived into being transported back to the Nanyang region, and then forced to return to the country again. These poor Overseas Chinese were originally overseas, but in recent years, due to the economic collapse in the Nanyang region and the increasing oppression from the local imperialist governments, they were unable to make a living and had to be forced to return to the country one after another. However, the rural areas of the country are becoming increasingly dilapidated, and there is no place to stand either. As a result, some people in the shipping companies in the Fujian and Guangdong areas came up with the absurd idea of ​​deceiving them, saying that the Nanyang economy had improved day by day, and that the local government's treatment of Overseas Chinese had also been greatly improved, which was a great opportunity to go there again. They believed this to be true, and pawned their belongings and borrowed money, barely managing to scrape together enough travel expenses and handing them over to the shipping companies to be "transported." They hid in the bottom of the triple-layered cabins, packed together with the cargo. Some were suffocated to death in transit, and were thrown into the sea when the ship returned to Hong Kong. When they arrived in Nanyang, they were discovered by the local government, all detained, and expelled back to the country. At this time, they had run out of money and were truly "with no way to go to heaven or earth." There are still four or five hundred of them stranded in Nanyang, unable to advance or retreat. This is what the newspaper reported. They, like the wealthy Overseas Chinese worshipped by some in the motherland, are also so-called "Overseas Chinese," but the results they obtain are so opposite. At this moment, who among those who worship wealthy Overseas Chinese has the time to pay attention to these poor Overseas Chinese who cannot advance or retreat!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Grandfather <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>Grandfather was a talented craftsman and sculptor. But the fate of his life was arranged under the gears of poverty. The peace and happiness of the world never fell upon him; In difficult days, biting hard on teeth, shouldering the burden of life, sighing and hoping: watching the spring come and spring go, flowers bloom and flowers fall. National sweat flows out, blood is squeezed dry, time gave him a cruel judgement, he is old! He can no longer squeeze his sweat and blood from an aging body for life to suck, in this lonely declining twilight years, he only gets to bring a sad mood, every day, quietly lying on a small table, finely carving and polishing his genius, seeking a little spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>The house is always so cold, empty, never revealing a voice of happy laughter, or casual conversation. Every day, from sunrise to sunset, grandfather himself hunches over, walking in and out, his wrinkled and dull face is always covered with a layer of gloomy look, sitting down, without saying a word, putting on his reading glasses, the knife in his hand gnawing at a gnarled piece of wood, tick-tick-tick, like a little mouse biting on hard food, making a fine rustling sound. Finally, he softly sighs, looks up and stares for a while at the two children squatting on the eaves digging mud and sand, and then gets up and searches in a bamboo basket hanging on the wall for two pieces of cake, calling kindly. "Come, Ah Ying and Ah Zha, watch the door, Gong Gong (grandfather) will be right back." My sister and I both smiled with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Grandmother walked into the room, saw the table full of knives and saws, wood and sawdust, and often nagged and ridiculed grandfather. Sometimes grandfather couldn't bear it and angrily retorted to grandmother. "What do you know!" Then he was silent again, then put down the knife in his hand and turned his face to grandmother, and the two of them talked about household matters, calculating uncertainly when the Nanyang water passengers would arrive, and perhaps uncle would send money. At this time, I always felt that something bad was going to happen in the house, and I didn't dare to look at the bamboo basket hanging on the wall, so I quietly pulled on my sister's sleeve and slipped out the door.</p>
<p>Year after year, time is long and endless, grandfather's back seemed to hunch over even more, and the long beard under his chin became longer and whiter. At the same time, there were several more very exquisite small ornaments on his small table, and grandmother's ridicule came even more often. However, grandfather did not seem to be satisfied with this, and every day he still lay on the small table from sunrise to sunset, silently carving and polishing, whiling away his lonely days, he seemed to be able to get comfort in his heart and spiritual sustenance only by constantly creating and working without interruption.</p>
<p>One day, grandfather finished a fruit platter for sacrifice, the finely carved flowers, the beautifully dazzling gold-leaf patterns, and the bright vermilion lacquer, all harmoniously and skillfully constituted the exquisite and delicate, elegant and refined appearance of this fruit platter. Grandfather was truly satisfied, he felt that he had gained supreme glory, and that all the past labor and energy spent had been fully rewarded. He let his knives and saws rest for several days.</p>
<p>One day, grandfather suddenly took this dish box out, but when he came back, the dish box was not brought back. He just looked very depressed, took out two long packets of silver coins from his sleeve, sat down by the table and stared blankly. That day, my sister and I did not get to eat his cakes. From that day on, grandfather was silently lying at the table again, finely carving and polishing…………</p>
<h3 id="e180">Shepherd Old Man <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>He has lived at the foot of this mountain slope for more than fifty years, and in these fifty years, he has lived a solitary life relying solely on herding sheep. He is like that kind of old man in the poems of ordinary people and in the paintings of painters, existing lonely at the foot of this mountain slope: from youth to adulthood, from adulthood to old age, he has never left that mountain slope, nor has he done any other business, always herding sheep in this mountain. Every day he stumbles up the mountain slope, stopping beside a cluster of large elm trees, and the lambs scatter, searching for their needed food in the gray-yellow pile of withered grass. He himself runs to a high place and sits on a broken tablet in front of a grave, leisurely smoking his dry tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>The Chicken Cage Mountain in the early morning is hidden in a thick morning mist, the sky is gloomy and somewhat hateful, and the heavy air permeates the solidified silence, making people feel oppressed even when breathing. The gray and dim clouds are pasted even tighter, and the weather is colder than when he got up, and the pine waves in the mountain are already surging; he is wearing that stiff and broken blue cloth coat, and he really can't stand it. He sits there shivering, two clear streams of snot crawling on his gray-yellow beard, he moves away his dry tobacco pipe, raises his trembling hand, wipes his mouth with his sleeve, and then exhales a puff of smoke:</p>
<p>"It's going to snow again!" He supports himself on the ground with that three-foot-long dry tobacco pipe, which also serves as a sheep herding bamboo pole and a crutch, and stands up, gazing at the sky, saying as if sighing.</p>
<p>He is most afraid of encountering snowy and rainy days, because in these weathers he cannot let the sheep out, but keeping them locked up for a day requires a load of dried mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>The sheep are his companions and his life. In the past, at the most, he alone had herded</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>two hundred ewes, grazing them around Chicken Cage Mountain during the day. Sometimes he would even pull open his sandy throat and hum a pastoral song, and he had to cut two bundles of dried grass every day. Because at that time wool could be sold for a dime or several cents per pound, shearing and sheepskins were very valuable, so he lived a very stable life. Although lonely and hard-working, he only worked mechanically and lived mechanically. He settled in that ordinary environment, passing the days day by day without longing or sorrow. But now, he feels that one hundred sheep are not enough, and besides, wool sheep are not worth much these days, six or seven cents per pound and no one wants to buy them, and sheepskins and shearing are also very cheap; therefore, his life has changed from stable to unstable.</p>
<p>He drove the sheep up the mountainside, still letting them find food for themselves, but he hid in a wind-sheltered rock to smoke. He took puff after puff, spitting the light blue embers in front of him, letting the wind blow them away. He seemed to want to use the power of this smoke to warm his stomach and his whole body. Looking at the sheep, one by one wandering in the woods, in the withered grass, their bleating sounds were scattered around the mountainside.</p>
<p>A series of cockcrows came from afar, and he knew it was almost noon, so he reached into his chest and pulled out a few dry pancakes; but although the pancakes were hard, because they were nestled in his chest, they were still a little warm, and the aroma of that kind of buckwheat noodles drilled temptingly into his nostrils. He picked up a pancake and put it into his mouth, which was devoid of front teeth, and chewed it carefully, chewing it. But after barely eating two, his gums were already hurting so much that he couldn't bite anymore.</p>
<p>The lambs leaped and bleated very lively on the mountainside. He squinted his old, blurred eyes and looked at the eighty or so sheep; he thought: more than half of these sheep are pregnant ewes, but those rams have to be sold, otherwise no one will want them when spring comes.</p>
<p>It is already the time of winter's end and spring's return, but he hasn't sold a single one of his thirty or forty rams, yet the lambs are about to be born.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shepherd Girl <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Kang</p>
<p>The shepherd girl, Baidanuolejin, lay prostrate on the grassland by the Satunke River, touching the small grass with her hand, and singing a Duerbote love song in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Above her head was the April sun, lazily scattering its coy smile. The Kexing'e Wuhang Plain was covered with a flat, boundless green felt, as quiet and stable as a sleeping girl, lying upside down in the gentle and warm sunlight. The purple flowers of the poplar trees sprayed fragrance, floating across the riverbank, gradually hiding in the air. The Satunke River, freed from its shackles, flowed leisurely, meandering south from the foothills of Mount Lusai Duan, edging the Kexing'e Wuhang Plain with an endless ribbon. The sky, the grassland, the river, the beach, ... the entire universe sparkled with bright, alluring colors, making this rough world tame and obedient.</p>
<p>The gurgling water broke the silence of the plain, and the herds of livestock in the distance and nearby, scattered like variegated stones on the grass; the tender and delicate green grass was painted with various colored spots, like a gorgeous carpet in a palace. The sheep playfully touched their horns. The lazy and stupid old cows lay basking in the sun on the grass, closing their eyes and snorting from time to time. A gunshot in the distant mountains startled the horses, which pricked up their ears. The light, thin clouds on the summit of Mount Lusai Duan also floated happily.</p>
<p>Baidanuolejin was drowsy from being caressed by the sunlight, her eyelids were dry and her body was so tired that she was about to become paralyzed. The singing had stopped in her mouth long ago. She slowly got up, rubbed her eyes, and stared blankly at Mount Lusai Duan. The old yellow dog beside her wagged its tail, its eyes looking straight at its master's expression. Baidanuolejin was obviously fantasizing about something? Finally, she ran around the flock of sheep in a circle, then ran back, leaned against the trunk of a poplar tree, and pondered foolishly: sometimes her brows furrowed, sometimes her face was full of smiles, this was naturally the memories of the past provoking her thoughts.

<p>National News Agency Electric report from St. John, California, USA, a large group of swallows flew to this place again today. For sixty-eight years, the date of arrival of the swallows has been unerringly accurate, always flying here on March 19th and flying away on October 23rd. Even in leap years, they are never mistaken. Mr. Tan Lao said, presumably the swallows also have a calendar, so their coming and going is so accurate. March 19th can be called "Swallow Arrival" Day, and October 23rd can be called "Swallow Departure" Day. All those who violate the New Life Movement and do not observe time, please look at the swallows.</p>
<p>The loss from the floods in the United States is now estimated to be no less than 500 million yuan. Washington seems to be able to escape danger as the water level of the Potomac River has slightly receded, but preventive measures have not been relaxed in the slightest. The White House is surrounded by sandbags, and the scene is very unusual. Mr. Tan Lao said, although the United States is called a gold dollar country, if we Chinese use astrology to predict, we would definitely say that having wealth and water is very auspicious.</p>

<p>— Wan Chao Chen Illustration Xin Xin Explanation</p>
<p>Nora, frightened and confused, heard the doorbell and mustered her spirits to open the door.</p>
<p>It was Dr. Nan Hai who came in.</p>
<p>Nan Hai painfully told her that his life's account was about to go bankrupt. – He was afraid that he would be buried in the grave and rot in less than a month. – When he got the definite bad news, he would send Nora a card with a black cross on it.</p>
<p>Nora, with a pitying heart, asked him to look at her feet, maybe he would look at other places. In addition, she asked Hai for strong evidence that they were good friends, and asked him to do something very, very difficult. Nan Hai was very happy to hear this, and he couldn't help but say: "Nora, do you think that he is the only person in the world who is willing—willing to die for you? I love you like—"</p>
<p>While they were talking, the maid Ailan brought in Kolock's card and handed it to Nora, making her scream in surprise.</p>
<p>Nan Hai asked her why, she said: It's a new problem, you go to the room and stay away from Taofo, don't let him come out.</p>
<p>Nan Hai laughed when he heard what was going on, so that's what it was, don't worry, I won't let him escape.</p>

<p>Opening "Ode to the Red Cliff"</p>
<p>Romantic scholar in Huangzhou. Every day I enjoy myself by the river. On the 15th day of Renxu Xin's year. I talked with two or three close friends. I leisurely asked to board the Red Cliff boat. A young moon rises from the eastern mountain. Leaning on the railing and looking at the Dipper for years. Playing the strings as a board to sing to the bright moon. I frequently fill up the cup with Taibai. A clear song and a cup of wine. The guests harmonize with the sound of the flute, the rhythm is quiet. The guest is a Taoist priest from the West. The sound he blows is lingering. The harmony is leisurely and long. Like a woman weeping on a lonely boat. We can lament Cao Mengde of that year. Composing poems and waving his spears leisurely. He went down to Jiangling and broke through Jingzhou. Thousands of axes flowed smoothly. He was indeed a hero of his generation. I don't know where he is now. Thirty-six thousand days easily pass. How fortunate it is for life to be like a mayfly. But now I see through false fame and fortune. Talking about what is connected, I am also ashamed. Wash the cup and drink. Look at the date pits. The cups and plates are messy and not free. We pillow on each other and turn into a small boat.</p>

<p>The First Branch of the Insect Sound Society, No. 49 Hele Lane, New Zha Road, Pike Road, inside the Meisheng Elementary School, was established yesterday. From today, the general and branch offices will simultaneously hold the second recruitment of male and female members. Anyone who loves opera art can sign up to join.</p>
<p>The Qipu Road address of the Great Nature Singing Society is very spacious and has its own piano, etc. It is heard that the work of the Insect Sound Society is intense, and it has obtained the consent of the society to rehearse dramas in groups at the society. (Above Bai Chong)</p>
<p>The sister of Chen Wei, the leader of the New Children's Broadcasting Troupe, will marry a flight student at the Aviation Military Academy.</p>
<p>Some people suspect that the name of the uncontracted reporter Qian Jishun is a "mixed-blood." In fact, it is Mr. Jin's pseudonym.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of singing groups in the broadcasting circle, from the most prosperous period to the current decline, jealousy, abuse, and secret injuries have always been prevalent. However, when asked about the person being scolded or the person scolding themselves, they will be at a loss. Especially pitiful are those who "blindly follow others." Often the failure of a group is due to "scandal" or "single-handed use of receipts." As a result, there is internal strife and friction, and a branch is established, forming two opposing groups. So I think if we still want to raise our heads and want to regain the lost ground, we should have a grand alliance, and no longer ridicule, be jealous of, abuse, or secretly injure each other. Immediately form a sound organization and unite.</p>
<p>We need a cleaning campaign... (Above Wei Qing)</p>
<p>Sun Qijun: These words may have pricked some people's scars again, and they will ask the editor to "repent" again. Jin Lang</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Zhou Gong of Rose Pavilion has organized a new business called "Family Supply Company," located at No. 145 Chihang Road, telephone number 31729, specializing in handling household goods and all miscellaneous tasks. It is also heard that the company will hold a staff examination at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month. It is also learned that there are still vacancies for female employees. Anyone who is eloquent, able to endure hardship and work hard can come to the venue temporarily to take the exam.</p>

<h3 id="e190">No Need for Nanjing to Call A Rebuttal to "Doesn't Know Hart" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Anonymous</p>
<p>I received a letter from a reader named "Anonymous," who told me a story from five years ago and attached a piece of writing, which is published below. I seem to remember that five years ago, Miss Liang lived next to the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, and Miss Liang also sat in a broken car owned by someone named Chen. Let's not talk about "old lovers," but "doesn't know" seems like a joke. Editor</p>
<p>"Hart ran to Nanjing to enter the Central Photography Studio because he couldn't stand in Shanghai."</p>
<p>But "Hart" was finally lifted up in "Warrior."</p>
<p>On the 24th of this newspaper, a half-naked small photo of him was published, with a note beside it: "The 'Warrior' of the Central Photography Studio will be released soon. Liang Weizhu's old lover 'Hart' is one of the protagonists..." Unexpectedly, Miss Liang called the next day to declare: "Doesn't know."</p>
<p>Let's not talk about "old lovers," but the question of knowing or "not knowing" is worth raising.</p>
<p>I remember that "Hart" knew Miss Liang, that was definitely the case. The introducer was originally a friend of both parties, someone named Chen. (At that time, Miss Liang was not as comfortable as she is now living in Qinyuan Village.) But now Mr. Chen is dead, and Miss Liang probably became a red dance star, so she easily "forgets," so she called to declare "doesn't know." And we who are "standing by as observers" couldn't help but come out to testify.</p>
<p>I hope Miss Liang thinks about things from five years ago?</p>

<p>"Peach and Plum Competing for Beauty" is a film directed by Li Pingqian, telling a story of complicated love disputes. It is starring Ye Qiuxin, Gu Lanjun, Wu Zhengxin, and Sun Min, and is a noteworthy work that is about to be completed.</p>
<p>"New and Old Shanghai," written by Hong Shen and directed by Cheng Bugao, tightly captures the complex and mysterious psychology of various groups of people in the metropolis of Shanghai, especially focusing on the psychological portrayal of Wang Xianqi and Shu Xiufen, a couple who won the aviation lottery number. It is a very interesting and meaningful film, and filming has already begun.</p>
<p>Recently, many powerful warriors have joined the ranks of stars: the charming Tan Ying, the athletic Ying Yin, and the innocent Ye Luqian, three ladies. Everyone will have even more eager expectations for them after joining the stars!</p>
<p>After a long rest, Hu Die's fans who are looking forward to her new work must be very anxious. Here is good news for everyone. Hu Die is going to star in Zhang Shichuan's "Lovers in Flight," which is also a script by Hong Shen.</p>
<p>Tan Ying, because she doesn't speak Mandarin very fluently, specially asked Miss Shu Xiufen, who speaks Mandarin very well, to accompany her often, which inadvertently gives her a good opportunity to practice speaking Mandarin. Miss Tan Ying is very smart, and in a short time, the results have been satisfactory. Before long, we will be able to see Miss Tan Ying's sound works.</p>
