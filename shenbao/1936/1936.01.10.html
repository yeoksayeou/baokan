<p>國際聯盟諸國倡議禁止煤油運意由來已久而降至今日尚遲遲不實行者以禁油一事關係意國及英法等國之命運在作此空前大冒險以前非有愼重之考慮不可。意國方面。認禁油無異於正式對意宣戰蓋意之飛機兵艦汽車坦克車。莫不賴汽油爲發動力。而意國本身無油礦。油之來源斷絕。無異制意大利之死命。鋌而走險。意大利之飛機固已準備作最後之犧牲。擲其人與彈於地中海英艦之上。英意之决戰。必爲禁油之直接結果也。</p>
<p>然英國所考慮者。不在於意大利之决心如何。而在於美國之態度如何。使美國根據現行中立法案。對於煤油棉花等物品。仍不禁止輸出。而堅持傳統上之貿易自由。必使英國投鼠忌器。不敢輕動。蓋如英國實施對意禁油。美國仍源源以煤油供給於意大利。制裁必無成效之可言。使英國於美國之運油船加以阻止。或於意國海岸加以封鎖。則美國必以妨及中立國貿易權利爲口實。而與英國有所衝突。英法諸國聯合對意。已感實力之不足。使美國從中作梗。非但必勝之券不可操。而戰爭結果如何。非吾人之能設想也。</p>
<p>近者。美國大總統鑒於美國與國際聯盟諸國有消極合作之必要。於本月三日向國會提出中立法之修正案。主張將中立法中禁止軍火輸出之規定。擴充之淤煤油棉花等物。使諸國對意實施禁油之際。美國之媒油貿易商人無權從中作梗。而免以美國之國旗破壞日內瓦集體之行動。此項新提案。在表面仍維持舊中立之態度。卽實行禁油。亦爲對交戰國雙方之實施。而非單獨加意大利之懲罰。然在事實上。因國際聯盟諸國對阿比西尼亞仍源源接濟。美國雖不助阿比西尼亞。無關重輕。意大利受國聯五十餘國之抵制。如美國亦對意禁止煤油輸出。則慕沙里尼必成爲天地間之獨夫。而意大利之飛機兵艦。將爲無血之屍體矣。故新中立法提案。言其實際效果。頗有利於國聯也。</p>
<p>抑美國中立新提案之動機。不在於歐洲而在亞洲。蓋意阿戰爭。與美國並無直接之關係。美國於意大利旣無仇恨。與英法及國聯。亦無所愛好。此决所以願犧牲其傳統的海上貿易自由。及中立國權利之主張。而促進集體的國際制裁之成功者。蓋美國深知日本必成爲意大利第二。而亞東戰爭一旦暴發。國聯與美國。亦應取同樣之步驟。使侵略國事前有所戒心。事後能及早就範。羅斯福之致國會演辭中。有痛斥侵略國家之語。於亞洲非洲之事亦相提並論。使國聯對意禁油之議。因美國之决心。而早日實現。則於懲戒侵略國家。促進集體和平。必有裨益。美國中立法之修正。或將成爲國聯生命之一興奮劑乎。</p>

<p>— 黃馥</p>
<p>照舊例，日本的政治節季是開始於陸軍大學習之後的十一月初旬的，今年（一九三五年）因為團體明徵問題，在照例「閒散」的八九兩月，也着實的鬧了一陣，「弱體」的岡田內閣好容易的發表了兩次澈底排擊「機關說」的聲明，組織了以「文敎刷新」為目的的「敎學評議會」，方才暫時的將「十月政變」的空氣緩和下去，過了十月，陸軍大學習期內，中央政界照例是平靜無事的，可是今年也因為政友會對於敎學評議會表示不滿而引起了一些風潮，十一月下旬和十二月末，正式的政治節季到了，前者的問題中心是在編定來年度的預算，後者的中心是在對付國會，所以「鰐水居士」所操縱的「岡田丸」始終是顛播在驚濤駭浪的政海裏面，他的前途也依舊籠罩着許多可憂慮的空氣。</p>
<p>在從前所謂「政黨」得勢的時候，以預算問題為中心的政爭前哨戰遠不及十二月下旬開始的對座談會戰那樣的嚴重，但是時世變了，九一八以來，日本經歷着一個長長的差不多沒有止境的非常時的時代，對政黨的鬥爭，已經變為第二義第三義了，在政治節季裏面最緊張最和最富號召力的節目，已經變為以大藏省和軍部了為主角的軍事預算；高齡八十二「半仙半俗」的達摩藏相勝呢，還是虎虎有生氣的軍部勝利。這是全日本也許是全世界人注視的中心。</p>
<p>自從九一八戰爭以來，日本軍事費每年銳　的增加，除出　　的軍事費如海陸軍　給，重工　國家補助等等之外，直接的軍事費已經占有了國家總預算的百分之四十六以上，為着補塡這種巨額的「非常支出」，日本已經發行了差不多已達限制度的「赤字公債」，而這些洪水般的公債，大部分是存在銀行界的保險庫裏面，很明白，日本金融資本家目前最憂慮的問題，是在如何抑制赤字公債的發行，使他不超過足以引起「惡性Inflation」的範圍，所以，被銀行家尊為「仙人」的高橋藏相對金融家第一個貴重的預約，就是「赤字公債」的漸减主義，可是一方面在軍部方面呢，認為一九三六年的危機正在目前，本年度在倫敦開會的海軍軍縮預備會議沒有成功的希望，在太平洋今後是一個軍備無條約狀態，而北方的蘇聯第二次五年計畫又有了預期以上的成功，對中國的大陸政策又有急待進行的必要，所以在來年度預算裏面提出了陸軍六億，海軍七億三千萬的龐大的要求（內陸軍新規要求三億四千萬，海軍新規要求三億），據大藏省十一月二十六日在閣議提出預算原定計畫，一九三六年（昭和十一年）歲入經常部一、四四八、〇〇〇（千圓），臨時部七八九、〇〇〇（內開普通歲入一二二、〇〇〇公債金六六六、八〇〇）共計二、二三八、〇〇〇千元、就是在明年度即使發行赤字公債六億六千六百萬，　歲入還是祗有二十二億三千八百萬元，現在要在這二十二億裏面支辦軍部要求的十三萬三千萬的軍費，那可眞的有點兒巧婦——不「仙人」難為無米之炊了！</p>
<p>再看一看本年度預算，「昭和十年度歲計預算，在槪算二十二億元裏面，軍事費約占十億圓以上，普通歲入不夠支配，所以發行了七億五千萬元的赤字公債，這正好像　六十五塊錢一個月的薪水生活者要過每月一百元的生活，不夠的三十五圓，就是負債，大約是因為時勢不好，所以在這一百圓裏面，四十七圓是拿去作為護身費了！」（昭和十一年朝日年　頁一四六）</p>
<p>這兒所說的「護身費」，實質上是早已超過「護身」之必要，而濃厚地帶着冒險性質的，護了自己不夠，而還要將防護綫劃到鄰人的「內房重地」去，甚至於還要借護身之名而為攻人之舉，那麽這每月收六十五圓的薪給生活者不夠開支，當然是在意料之內的了。</p>
<p>這種「護身費」的多少，和舉債的出處‘自以非常時開始以來，就變為每年預算鬥爭的重要的目標。岡田內閣的政治的基調，除出濃厚的海軍色彩之外，主要的支持者是與金融資本有密切關聯的「重臣集團」，和可以看作銀行界的直接的Agent的民政黨，所以在整個預算計畫上講，從銀行界的利益方面看想，唯一的「健全的」手段是停止公債政策（最少是公債漸减，）而改為「一般的」增稅，可是一般增稅不僅軍需工業界反對，就是目下「疲敝已極」的農村，也有不堪再摘的危險，一九三四——五年度預算當時，藤井藏相發行了巨額的公債之外還不足以應付軍部要求的時候，就提出了局部的增稅方案，這種增稅在軍需工業和紡織工業引起了很大的反感，後來終於因為有價證券的跌價，藤井藏相因「病」辭職，而由銀行界再請「半仙半俗」的高橋出山，來作為銀行界對軍部壓力的「壁障」。高橋是淸這位八十老人不僅是政友會的長老，國家的重臣，銀行界的大前輩，他的政治上的比重和聲望更已經是超越黨派而被認為「國寳」的存在，銀行界實業界知道祗有他才能對軍部「講話」，所以藤井失敗之後終於不顧一切又將這位精神上钁鑠的老人請出來了。</p>
<p>在預算鬥爭開始的時候，照例是各省的開價，和大藏大臣的「裁定」，本年度預算，和上面所說一樣的軍部開價是十三億三千萬以上，這很分明地和大藏省的原案有了很大的間隔，一切其他的預算，早已不為人們所注意了，大家的目光，集中在老藏相對軍部這一齣精彩的壓軸戲上，日本近年來有一句流行語叫做「吃他呢還是被他吃？」這緊張的情景倒和這成語很相像了，在陰　地沉默了好一回之後，十一月二十八日的晚報大書特書的發表了高橋藏相對預算方針的聲明。聲明的原文是：</p>
<p>「從天然資源缺乏之點看來，也可以知道日本能否孤立地自給自足還是一個疑問。看一下世界情勢，今後要遭遇困難的國家，第一是意大利，但是意大利還有法國的後援，法國因對德國的關係，非與意國結合不可，可是日本呢？日本因為產業與貿易的顯著的進展，遭遇着各國的嫉視。我們應該仔細地想一想自己的國家！所以，預算也該應着國民的所得而編定，財政上的信用，是無形的，維持這種信用，是最大的急務。假使單單注意國防，終至惹起惡性膨脹而破壞了信用，那是國防也决不能鞏固的！對於萬一的時候，應該有一點準備和餘裕　好，可是回頭一看國內狀態，却是一個天災不斷，民生憔悴的時候，在社會政策，有許多地方値得考慮，軍部對於此點，也請仔細地考慮一下　好！……」</p>
<p>冗長地引用了原文，不僅是為了說明這次預算的結癥，主要的倒是因為這聲明最明顯地表白了日本金融家對目下國際形勢所持的態度。上記的的高橋聲明，照字面看似乎是事理之常，但是在現代日本公然能夠代表銀行家講這樣的話的却祗有高橋是淸一個！東京朝日新聞對於這聲明評為「座談會應該講而不能講，人民應該希望而不能希望的，他竟敢然地講了！老藏相健在依然！」實在並不是沒有根據的。</p>

<p>我國對意實施經濟制裁、限制中國去貨、並於意國運華貨、亦實行禁止提卸、我近來北德公司特快班輪、得此千載一時良機、不特往來貨擁、且旅客更多、票價已經飛漲、爰將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>意貨問題</p>
<p>照江海關公布制裁意國貨之往來貿易、已限定由意到滬之進口貨、凡在本月一日以後至上海者、槪不許提卸、嗣後經江海關二决宣布、奉到中央財部修正之制裁意貨辦法、如在上年十二月內訂購運裝之貨、尚可通融提取、故此次由意來滬蘇門答臘號、於昨日進口者、來貨仍可提取、又有貨輪希爾特號、Hilda將於本月二十五日到滬、因其船內所載多爲十二月三日以前離意之貨、亦可照提、惟本月開出、而於下月到滬者、始受制裁之拘束云、</p>
<p>德輪發達</p>
<p>北德公司上年特造三快輪、本爲與意郵船競爭中歐航路、自香霍斯脫、與柏士丹、兩新船開航後、貨客兩業、仍不及意船之優、會國聯制裁意貨、意郵船行駛遠東者、已受無形打擊、北德公司特快輪、營業乃遂勃興、來往貨客、突然大增、第三新船「那愛司奴」尚未落成、北德已如入行駛大西洋之「史都介德」號郵船Stuttgart來華代航、昨得電告、本月十七日已可至滬、貨客兩皆滿艙、營業之佳、出乎意外、</p>
<p>票價增漲</p>
<p>當北德造航遠東三特快船時、其頭等室艙位票價、從廉核訂、故上海乘船赴馬賽、定價爲一百零二鎊、今外匯較昂、無形中已增十分之一、近因制裁意國後、北德郵船上海去歐乘客、已預購至三四個月以後、其價亦增售至一百十鎊、其他各埠與二等室客位、亦一律漲起四鎊、至於來回票更增十鎊以上、卽在本月分由滬出口之各郵船起實行云、</p>

<p>— Louisa　Alcott　原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「也許是老母雞吞了下去；她們都是嗷食的小傢伙」，她說道；小橋不由得笑了，她動了火，竟去打她的哥哥，直使他吃了一驚，她於是放聲大哭，奔跑開了，一路却還喊着：「他不的！他不的！他不的」！</p>
<p>她的姨母和姨丈都不願去搖動那孩子對於她朋友的信任，只希望她天眞的感覺或確能有一天證明是不錯的，因此也更喜歡她。後來這件事過去之後，乃德常說假如沒有小梅，他簡直是忍不過去的。別人儘客避他，她不願隨聲附和，偏比以前更接近他，當他拿他的破琴聊自安慰的時候，她現在竟不坐在外面的階沿上，竟進去坐有他的旁邊靜聽着，臉上充滿了信托與情愛，此時乃德也渾忘了他的羞辱，心中好不快樂。她請他幫助她的課業，她在她的小廚房裏為烹調各色各樣的食物，他都能全心地吞嚥下去，不管它是什麽，因為感激的情緒可使味道最劣的也傳着一種香澤。她見到他不敢和別的童子一同嬉戲時，便提議兩個人玩野球，隊球等，她從她的小園裏采了些小花朶來放在他的寫定檯上，—以種種方法來表示她不是隨風轉的朋友，不管他的社會地位怎樣，她總是忠誠到底。南恩不久也跟着她做，至少在外表態度上不使別人難堪；她約束她的尖利的口舌，也不使她那個常要露出輕藐的小鼻子有一些兒懷疑或不悅的表示，這在祁譚太太尤為不易（註），因為她深信不疑錢必是乃德拿去的。</p>

<h3 id="c191">阿森和他的牛 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>這好像是他的習慣動作，黃蠟般的牙齒咬着那根老滑的短旱烟管的時候，阿森總要把頭甩一甩、讓那條長長的辮子搖一搖，於是他才肯把兩隻手拼命在幾隻破衣裏摸索着。</p>
<p>一根短短的紅頭洋火摸出來了，在地上唿喇一擦，烟缸紅了一下子，嘴便用勁的吸，一圈圈的烟霧跟着他舒爽的呼吸飛出來，漸漸地到那田野上消散了。</p>
<p>現在，阿森就在靑石板上坐下來，也像那從嘴裏飛出去的烟圈兒那樣，腦子裏也朦朦朧朧地墜入深思中去了。</p>
<p>十一月的太陽，完全像春二三月一樣和暖，照得那已經耕過的土地像一塊金色的魚麟似的。那不曾墾過的土地上，有許許多多的麻雀兒啁啁地啄着那金色的荒穗。這的確是一個很適宜於深思的時候。</p>
<p>阿森把眼睛瞇得細小地，數着那被他已經耕過的土地。那一塊塊金色的魚麟都在向他微笑，於是他的心也微笑了。</p>
<p>「快啦，快啦，只有東面的二畝五分啦。」</p>
<p>忽然，二個笨重的聲音給他嚇了一驚。他轉過頭去：是他的牛因為不服這條牛繩在笨重地跳着腿，掙扎着。他憤怒地在靑石板上狠狠地敲着他那根光滑的旱烟管，嘴裏厲聲地叱着：「畜生！畜生！畜生！吼！吼！」</p>
<p>那畜生平靜下去了，他又半閉着眼睛緩緩地想着，想着。一種吶吶地自言自語的聲音咕嚕着：「這畜生，跟我也够苦了。這二畝五分耕了以後，也該買些花餅給牠補一補…」</p>
<p>花餅？一想到花餅，他立刻想起花邊來。那圓圓一塊塊的花餅不但樣子和念起來的聲音像花邊；而且那上行把花餅那樣天天漲價，也實在跟天天少下去的樣賓貴呢！這使他心一緊，馬上來了一陣寒戰。</p>
<p>他把旱烟管收起來，在褲帶上一繫，眼睛便更迷茫地走入深思中去了。</p>
<p>冬耕完了…花餅實在還不重要，重要的還是三人子的糧食呀…他又想到那個永遠苦巴巴的妻子了，她一輩子補破衣，挑糓担，挑糞桶，挨罵…漸漸地，他的思想轉到對面墳場上割牛草的阿福身上去了。這小孩子也太苦啦，到現在還只單布衫褲，雪快要飛了呢。</p>
<p>於是，他又想着借糓賬。年目前情形是非再借些穀賬不可的了。如果借了呢，今年是可以舒服過去，明年下種的本錢也有了…金榮老　突然在他的腦子裏跳出來，那一對老鼠眼睛笑眯眯，又在計算人家的財產啦。一個月以前給他勒去的一担穀上市的時候，他就可以勒兩担…</p>
<p>一種驚人的聲音把他的深思打斷了：</p>
<p>「逃牛！逃牛！」</p>
<p>這是對面墳場上的阿福和許多割草的小孩子喊出來的聲音。阿森立即把視綫從墳場上轉過來，果然，他的牛折斷牛繩逃了。他霍的立起來，像風一樣迅速地追趕上去，一面急急地做着手勢哤對面的阿福：</p>
<p>「阿福！阿福！我兜那邊！兜住牠！兜住牠！」</p>
<p>牛，像脫了牢籠的獅子，牠又恢復幾千年前的原始性了，狂暴地踨着蹄，尾巴憤怒地翹着，低着頭，兩隻角像兩枝箭一樣飛着。牠跳過魚鱗彀的泥土，牠踏過枯黃的稻根，嚇走了那羣啄荒穗的金麻雀，一躍越過那些割草孩子們的頭，向着墳場那邊一直一直，去了。</p>
<p>阿森喘着氣，褲帶上的旱烟管時常打着他的手，頭上長長的辮子時常甩着他的眼睛，他是被阻碍着；而那隻畜生却好像愈走愈快了。他喘着，喘着，走着，走着，最後終究看見那隻繁重停下來了。</p>
<p>站在那個荒凉的小丘上，牠嘴裏嚼着那墳旁嫩綠的靑草，舌頭時常伸出來舐那出着蒸氣般的事鼻孔，牠的尾巴安閒地搖着。一定的，牠以為這裏是已經逃出人世以外的地方了。以後，牠想把小丘當作野山了，像另的野獸在山洞裏一樣，牠也要把這裏做牠的故鄕了。以後，牠想一定可以脫離覇絆了，在這故鄉的樂園上完全為自己勞動了。一定的，牠也會想到，以後是開始牠的美滿的生活了。</p>
<p>可是，這裏仍舊是阿森可以走得到的地方。他已經喘着氣追到了。他笑着，罵着：</p>
<p>「畜生！畜生！這是墳呀！這是墳呀！」他把「墳」字特別叫得高，意思好像是說：「你這樣是踏進墳墓裏去啦！」</p>
<p>那畜生看阿森追來，本年原始性，在那墳墓的空隙處掘着牠的角，唿喇，牠的頭轉進墳裏去了，牠的尾巴却在墳墓外面安閒地得意地搖着。</p>
<p>阿森的笑聲更高了，差不多這是他平生第一次的狂笑。他超過去，用力地拖着牠的尾巴，他想把牠從墳墓裏拉出來；一面還是高聲地格格笑個不住。</p>
<p>那在墳墓裏的頭，憤怒地叫了：「　」</p>
<p>不曉得怎麽一來，突然像一枝利箭刺過阿森的心，他的笑聲也狐朋狗友中止了。他的粗魯的手指放下那尾巴像木鷄的爪子一般垂着，他的臉上每一條縐紋都劃出來了。不知道是汗還是淚，晶瑩地映着十一月太陽光的顏色，從那呆瞪着的眼睛，從那每一條縐紋中，從那汚穢的布衫上，撲簌簌地流下來了。他是呆住了。他是想着他從前因為繳不出租逃避到山洞裏去，後來給金榮老闆找到了，拖着他的辮子從山洞裏拉出來的那時候的情景了！</p>
<h3 id="c192">銀座小記 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 吳穆</p>
<p>一九三五年一霎眼便已到了「歲暮」的時候了。日本的什誌界是出名趕早的；明年的「新春號」與「新年號」已經早已出來。報紙上這兩天也滿載着各大百貨公司「歲暮大福引」「歲暮大賣出」的廣吿。晚上，如到銀座一帶去走時；這兩天比了往昔也更要熱鬧一些，每個人都忙着，婦人們更是在百貨公司裏走出進地忙着買東西，買禮物。是預備過年的景象了。</p>
<p>隨便什麽地方只要一到快過年的時候，是總會較平時熱鬧一些的。但這「熱鬧」，有時候表面上看來雖然是熱鬧，骨子裏却往往是比了平時更加倍地蕭瑟。東京不是也正是如此麽？</p>
<p>是的。東京的幾家最大的百貨公司如三越，高島屋松坡屋之類都在利用着這個「歲暮」的好機會舉行「大賣出」了。花花綠綠的商品堆滿了美觀的玻璃橱窗，各店的「女中」們比了平時也都更殷勤地招待着客人，但買東西總要錢的！除了少數眞正的「資本家」之外；大部份中產階級或小有產階級到底只能揀便宜的買了一兩樣也就算了。有時揀了半天；覺得貨物實在好；但到底為了價錢太貴而不得不拋下的神情是也常可在一般買物者的臉上發見的。百貨公司裏一天不知有多少人跑過，但眞正買了東西走的；該不到一半吧？</p>
<p>為了「歲暮」的「大福引」「大賣出」；銀座這兩天的霓虹燈光是更?爛奪目。豪華，燦爛，音樂的聲音四處飄盪着。但是就在這種最大的舞場或百貨公司旁邊的小巷裏，就有抱了自己的小孩，不得不索索抖地在黑暗裏跪着求乞的人，高貴的士女們走過這些求乞者的身旁時眼却不屑對他們看一下；一樣是「歲暮」啊，這些求乞者們便根本無從參加「帝國士女」們的準備過新年的工作了。我想，這些在黑暗裏求乞者的存在，對於銀座的歲暮繁榮實在是最大的威脅。為的是銀座即使百貨公司，酒館，舞的霓虹燈光再亮些，黑暗的地方到底是比了光亮的地方多！</p>

<p>過完了都由憂鬱的秋天，從北國却吹來了冬天的風雲。</p>
<p>一塊石頭開始從心上取去了，冬天的雨雪中突生了火燄。夜。一條長蛇在黑暗中展延着，那後面遺留着黑暗。鐘聲響了，響起了久壓心底的呼喊；呼喊，呌醒了復甦的夢。</p>
<p>朔風在吹吧？捲起了中國的浪濤。露重呢？滴落了心上的煩苦的夢。</p>
<p>餓着肚子，脚步蹣跚地靠在別人的肩上；別個人又靠在另個人的肩上。跋踄吧，天會亮起來的。</p>
<p>喊吧，喊吧，樹影都搖動起來。什麽是明天呢？什麽有明天呢？</p>
<p>明天：脚痛麽？不，路長着呢！喉噪麽？前邊有甘露在。</p>

<p>— 西村</p>
<p>如果你們曾經失過業，而且失業期間又是很長久的，當你們在苦苦奔走職業中，後來居然謀到了一個位置，那你們是最明瞭此中眞情的人。我是說，你們因此可以猜到我對於這新掘得的工作該是怎樣勤苦，怎樣忠於職守的了。眞的，我為了長久尋不到工作，幾乎由於絕望而在幻想怎樣自殺才好的方法了。人到了窮途末路什麽怪事都作得出的。</p>
<p>從晚上六點鐘到午夜十二點鐘是我的新職業的工作時間，一間排字房裏，擠着我們九個汚手垢面的工人，身上身下全沾滿了一層鉛灰和油漬。對於這新的工作，雖然那微小的報酬呌人說不出口，我却很知道怎樣遵守時間作事，不偷懶，也不取巧。</p>
<p>照理作排字夜工的屋子，電燈應該特別光亮一些，實際却不然，我們這一間黑屋子只裝兩隻電燈，燈泡全是十五枝光的怎能照得通亮呢。多虧這一間異乎尋常的小屋，三面沒有窗，有窗子的那一面，又讓別家高牆擋得風雨不透，黑暗中反倒赤得亮一些，但因此，空氣沉悶也實在够人消受了。幸而這是冬天，若在夏天，我想作工作人一定會變成汗濕鬼的，就說讓暑氣薰死幾個人命年來也是很有可能的。</p>
<p>我們五個人有的排字，有人作印工，鉛字架擺在牆角處，黑糊的攤着一片，其中次序排列的先後，是以普通字典的檢部為定準的，未從檢字之前，先要想好哪一部，旣費心力又費眼力，我這新手却感覺不大便當。</p>
<p>同伴趙麻子為這事曾經給老板供獻過意見說：「老板，這些鉛字我看頂好依照「四角號碼」檢字辦法排列，以後檢取起來，一定比現在便當多了。」</p>
<p>什麽呌「四角號碼？」我不大知道，我猜想這東西名字別怪，一定很難學，那麽，趙麻子可不是有意開我這新手的玩笑麽？我不贊成，哪個理會這古怪的路道！可是趕得巧，不待我反對，老板先就不答應，他那時伸手埒埒八字鬍，抽一口水烟，拉下臉來說：「什麽四角五角的，我不明白那些東西，中國怎樣弄糟的？知道麽？凈是你一個花樣他一個花樣弄糟的！花樣少還好辦，越多越容易壞，越不容易上正道！」</p>
<p>「方便啊，找起字來眞快呢。」趙麻子不顧風勢好壞，又接着說了一句，補充他的意見。</p>
<p>老板聽完話，把水烟袋放下了，歪着臉面死釘着趙麻子，好像要把他一口全吞下去似地氣冲冲說：「不成！不成！一千個不成！你說方便我偏說不方便！再說，你管保能在這里作一輩子生活麽，你若是一朝另有高就離開此地，後來的人不會四角五角那一套東西可怎麽辦，圖方便，反倒多添了麻煩！」</p>
<p>我那時樂得跳了起來，老板的話正說在我的心裏，我禁不住插嘴道：「老板的話一點不錯，趙麻子，收拾起你的新花樣罷，莫再多心多勞多討沒趣了。」</p>
<p>使我永也忘不了的是趙麻子那時怒目瞪我的臉神，全然是敵意的，他大聲喝道：「你這混人也想多嘴？你就不打牌保護你的眼睛？你願意當瞎子麽！」</p>
<p>那晚上出了排字房，我一邊走着一邊覺得不大舒服，趙麻子不該在老板面前罵我混人，他分明在侮辱我！我要找到他理論，正好，他這時從後面追上我，呼呼吃吃喘着氣，他宛若看透了我將要向他責難，理論的心事，攀住我的肩頭笑着說：「老弟，我請求你別生氣，好吧？我還有話跟你說呢。」</p>
<p>我沒有回答，當眞生起氣來，我正在怪着他呢。他看我一聲不出的情形，顯然引起他內心的不安，他强拉過我的手緊緊握着，依然是帶着笑跟我說：</p>
<p>「我是太莽撞了，可是你也太好多心，一個工人說話沒有照書本子說的呀，我錯了，請你原諒這一回。」</p>
<p>「我沒有生氣，你却要我怎樣原諒你。」我本打算鬧他一頓的，這時反覺有些不好意思。我失悔我自己太量小，趙麻子那種放蕩不拘的氣槪實在很可羨佩。我回答的話，話語非常不自然，聰明人聽起來或許認為我在說假話依然生氣呢。</p>
<p>趙麻子可够直爽，他完全聽信了我的回話，臉上托出信實親熱的歡笑，緊接着把談話轉到別處去。</p>
<p>午夜時分街上本來就特別冷靜，這帶地方又是僻靜區域，所以都不見車輛來往了，行人，除了我們兩人之外，活動着的東西只有冬夜的寒風和街燈下映照出來的忽長忽短我們兩個人的身影罷了。</p>
<p>「老弟，你年靑啊，」走一會，趙麻子望望我又開口了，「你相信我這話吧？你不再怪罪我吧？我向你，—你知道作一個排字工人最後的好處麽？—那好處將使你賺到兩只紅眼睛—全是因為尋找鉛字在鉛字中打滾邀壞的，我說用「四角號碼」原是為自己打算，昀於尋找，少費目力的，你誤會了我的好意。」</p>
<p>「但是那就因為我不知道什麽呌「四角號碼」的原故呀。我眞以為那樣一來就添了麻煩，所以我反對。說眞話，你旣沒有敎給我使用方法，也不好怪找呀。」</p>
<p>後來有一天當我跟他學好了「四角號碼」檢字法之後，確然感覺到檢字本身的方便處，便對他說：「麻子，這方法不錯，我從前眞是錯怪了你。」我倒悔自己學得晚了些，抱歉般說，「怎麽你不早吿訴我，不是那一回請求老板採用時也好替你加加油油麽。」我當眞惋惜那一次年掉的機會，我想兩人一齊建議，老板也許就會接受了我們的意見的。那可有多麽好。</p>
<p>「現在說去也不晚，只要有道理隨時都可以去說。」</p>
<p>過兩天，我兩個果然把這意見說給老板了，出頭的是我們兩個，另外的夥伴也在從旁說些贊助的話，因為他們也全學會了這種「四角號碼」檢字新法。</p>
<p>「哼！」老板先哼一聲，望我一眼反問道「小六子，你也說出這一套新花樣的話來了？你不是不贊成的麽？」</p>
<p>「因為現在我知道這方法當眞方便得多呀。」</p>
<p>「方便得多？我偏不想方便，看你們怎樣！」他憤憤地說，把水煙袋往桌子上一摔。「別人說新法簿記方便；我到現在還用老式賬簿，也沒有讓不方便累個死！作事情也好常常更改？祖傳老法多可賓貴，能够輕易變換？胡說亂道簡直着了魔！好，你們維新去罷，另外找有「四角」「五角」的地方去作罷，我這里留不住你們這樣的高材！算我　尊了你們！」</p>
<p>生意因此被停歇了，好容易尋求到職業，現在又失業，眞够痛心的。起初我還怨趙麻子這一套四角害人，後來一想問，明白過來當老板的一類人的生意經時，也就沒有什麽麽不痛快的了，早晚這工作上小小的波折都會發作的，這又有什麽關後！</p>

<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>夜晚不久，對着書桌的頭偶然抬起來，跟着背靠在椅背上，從窗口通過了天井，看見和天井成一斜綫的月亮，似乎是一個發現，竟不由自主地說。</p>
<p>「今天有月亮了」！</p>
<p>頓時轉念一想，「今天」已是廢歷初十了呀，該早有了，正在覺得有點後悔說這句話的無意識，雖然這句話也是無意識地說出口的。</p>
<p>「這個月裏，你是第一次看見月亮麽」？妻問，可是帶驚異的口氣。</p>
<p>我有點茫然了：「第一次，做什麽」？</p>
<p>「一月裏第一次看見月亮，坐着看見的，這個月裏就不忙，走着看見的，就忙，睡着看見的，就更不忙」。</p>
<p>「有這種話」？但我知道所以說的意思。</p>
<p>「是一般的俗說」。</p>
<p>我起初以為又是什麽精神作用，聽到「俗說」，想來，並不是偶然的。比較說罷，走着不是忙麽？坐着不是閒麽？睡着不是更閒麽？</p>
<p>不過，走着看見月亮，却還有一點閒，「　月」和「步月」是不同的，坐着不一定看見，睡着更是入睡要緊，而和這些相反，儘有走着，坐着，睡着「看月」的，這算是「免俗」了。</p>
<h3 id="c197">論咬文嚼字 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>去年以來，曾經有過一個大家不很注意，然而事實上却頗重要的問題，那就是所謂「咬文嚼字」。參加討論的人雖少，但對於這一問題的意見，却也還可以分做兩派，一派純粹是反對的，他們以為咬文嚼字並不是文學，要有好的文學，必須從現生活里去學習；一派除了反對傳統的流弊外，同時又給了咬文嚼字一種新的意義，以為適當的咬文嚼字，正是文學上的技巧的修養。</p>
<p>我的意見，是比較接近於後者的。</p>
<p>唐朝的徐彥伯先生，做起文章來，一定要把鳳閣寫做鸚閣，龍門寫做虬戶，金谷寫做銑谿，玉山寫做瓊獄，竹馬寫做篠驂，這並非為了要切合事實，不過是求其深奧，難懂，這就是嚼字；孔乙己先生看見孩子們向他討茴香豆，便搖着頭說：「不多不多！多乎哉？不多也。他並非在做試情詩，也不是要引證典籍，然而却偏要找近於書本的語句，這就是咬文。這樣的咬文嚼字，我們是應該反對的。用綺麗的詞藻，典雅的語文，來掩飾文章內容空虛的人們，在現在這個文壇上，只有受到被排斥，反對，自己慢慢地沒落下去的命運。</p>
<p>但我為什麽又讚成咬文嚼字呢？因為我所說的咬文嚼字，是另有一種新的意義的，我以為一個人對於自己的或者別人的文章，在寫或者讀的時候，應該仔細，審愼，而咬文嚼字又却合於這個條件。我們所要咬出來，嚼出來的，並不是綺麗，浮泛，典雅，而是簡練，明澈，清楚，正確，質樸，切合於事實的文字。</p>
<p>蘇聯的新作家們，對於過去古典作家的致力於自己作品的推敲，是很為推崇的。托爾斯太把戰爭與和平改寫了七次，萊蒙托夫寫一行要改好幾回，柴霍甫曾說「稿了要總牠躺下醫治」。這些這些，在他們的中間傳播，成為美談。為什麽呢？就因為用詞的正確，簡鍊，明澈，質樸，必須多多地借重於咬和嚼的緣故。</p>
<p>近來讀到，本　　　　　　裏面有一段說：</p>
<p>「馣昔詞人琢磨之苦，至有一字窮歲月，十年成一賦者。白樂天詩詞，疑皆衝自陽文忠公作文旣畢，貼之牆壁，坐臥觀之，改正盡善，方出以示。薘曾于文忠公諸孫望之處，得東坡先生數詩稿，其和歐叔弼詩云：淵明為小邑，繼圈去寫定，改作求字，又連塗小邑二字作縣令，字凡三改，乃成今句。至胡椒銖兩多，安用八百斛，初云：胡椒亦安用，乃眝八百斛，若如初語，未免後人庛議。又知雖大手筆，不以一時筆快為定，而憚于屬改也」。</p>
<p>我們雖然覺得一字窮歲月，十年成一賦，未免過於戰戰兢兢，有點可笑。但上個緊要的字，必須經過一番深思熟慮；寫一部偉大的著作，應該經過多年的孕育，却是一個不移的事實。</p>
<p>沈　　　　辟語　也有一條說：</p>
<p>「古人不廢鍊字法，然以意勝，而不以字勝。礦能平字見奇，常字見險，陳字見新，朴字見色，近人挾以門勝者，難字而已」。</p>
<p>這也說明了我們所當咬的嚼的是什麽。不錯，我們需要豐富的語彙，字彙，但也不主張丟開書本，不過我們所從吸收語彙，字彙的書本必需是現代的，普通的，在這一點上，因為事實的需要，我們可以引用外來的，也就是所謂歐化的語句，但絕對不必從荘子和文選裏去找難字，古語，來一挾以門勝」。</p>
<p>這可以和「不必」，正是咬和嚼的結果。</p>
<p>除了書本以外，更重要的，是從現生活裏去學習，採取，引用土語—尤其是大家所能懂得的土語，要緊的是選擇。選擇，這不是證明了我們也還得咬和嚼麽？</p>
<p>偉大的作品必需有正確的，豐富的，動人的內容。但這正確的，豐富的，動人的內容，是由作家們用詞傳達出來的，所以，我們也不忘記求這詞的完善，換一句話說，就是求形式上的成功。</p>
<p>這樣，我們需要咬和嚼。</p>

<p>— 劍文</p>
<p>上海一埠。人烟稠密。華洋雜處。為中外觀瞻所繫。乃東方唯一巨埠。推銷國產。旣以斯處為大宗。對於世界經濟。國內金融。關係亦殊密切。况乎年來建設日新。大上海計劃。决第實現。巍巍大廈。到處皆是。今又於南京路西藏路勞合路間。有嵯峨建築物。聳立雲表。該處交通便利。車水馬龍。極盛一時。以是萬衆囑目。斯何物歟。蓋卽今日正式開業之大新公司也。</p>
<p>大新公司。顧名思義。規模之偉大。設備之新穎。自無疑義。然斯大新公司。不僅在上海足以一新耳目。實我國百貨公司之翹楚。因該公司於民國元年。卽發軔於香港。又經營分店支行兩所於廣州。迄今垂二十餘年。向來本服務社會之旨。定價不二。薄利多銷。故社會人士。交相稱譽·引以為購貨之唯一勝地。港粵兩處之成功。固非出於偶然也。</p>
<p>今者鑒於上海對於新式百貨商店之需要。於是積極籌備。添設滬行。現已落成。仍本原旨。竭力經營。以副社會人士之雅望。謹將其設備特點略舉如下</p>
<p>（一）建築優美　該公司大廈，轟立於南京路西藏路勞合路之間，佔地的八畝，全部高十層，採用鋼骨水泥建築法，乃本埠基泰工程司設計，對於全屋光錢空氣莫不採取最新建築原理，外牆砌以國貨乳黃色釉面瓷磚，門面砌靑島黑色花綱石，內部店面地板舖意大利石，二三層則分舖膠質及柚木地板，內部外表均極光潔美觀。</p>
<p>（二）新式電梯　該公司所置之新式電梯，升降迅速舒適，梯門之啟閉，均屬自動，不假人力，顧客乘用，允稱利便。</p>
<p>（三）光綫問題　百貨商店旣為百貨雜陳萬衆聚集之公共塲所，則光錢之適合，自須顧到，况乎選擇貨品，欲鑒別準確之顏色，非有準確之燈光不可，故該公司於光綫一項，特別注意，務使顧客身入大廈，耳目一新，選擇貨物，非常滿意，斯固足以表示該公司設備之新，而為顧客設想之一斑矣。</p>
<p>（四）氣候問題　調節室內溫度，為現代新建築設備上一大問題，該公司對於此點，允為致意，室內備有冷暖氣管，冬無嚴寒，夏無酷熱，頗有八節常春之象。</p>
<p>（五）電動扶梯　百貨商塲分佈數層，顧客選購，不免有上落奔走之煩，故新近之偉大建築，俱設電梯以供升降，惟在顧客擁擠之時，仍不免有所不足，該公司有鑒於斯，特於裝設最新式電梯之外，更添設電力自動扶梯兩堂，由舖面直達三層樓，此項裝置實為全國之創舉，顧客祇須立足其上，卽能隨梯上下，穩妥迅速，為升降設備之別開生面者。</p>
<p>（六）貨品陳列　百貨雜陳，其排列之層序，頗有研究，品類之連擊，佈置之整潔，供應之便利，在在均與顧客之心理及選擇有關，該公司於此特為留意，而允注意於行人地位之寬敞，務使無擁擠之虞，而有舒適之威。</p>
<p>（七）各部配置　該公司現在暫以一樓至四樓闢為商塲，五樓以上則闢為遊樂塲所，地居上海繁盛中心，而偉大之跑馬塲卽在其前，廣塲一望，空氣淸新，為其他鬧市所不易覯者，茲將其內部支配，列表如下，藉作響導。</p>

<p>地窨</p>
<p>地響設商塲，東西各國多有先例，但在上海則為創舉，設計顧興大新公司當局，幾經慎密考慮，認為此種計畫，於公司及者客，皆極有利益，不過對於隔潮及交通二點，不能不有週全之計畫耳，故現時地窨南邊，為賣貨塲，計佔全面積的三分之二，除電梯外，前後有大樓梯四堂，通上層舖面入口處，中部梯一堂，上頭層中部至便利也，並附設收貨包裹及送貨等機關，以利顧客，西北角為機器房，與舖面不連，可由外院直達，束北角為進貨開箱散倉等地位，另備出路，</p>

<p>頭層</p>
<p>三面通街，共有入口七處，通上層買貨塲梯四座，客升降機三座，貨機一座，羅絲送貨機一處，且各該樓梯地位，皆經詳細研究，務求分配得宜，交通便利，此外由頭層至二層，尚有升梯一具，爲上海各公司所未有，位居中點，每梯每點鐘可運客四千人，無等候擁擠之慮，顧客站立上升，舖內俯覽無餘，更為便利。</p>
<p>頭層共有櫃台的三千尺，為上海各大公司中之最多者，各走路皆寬至十一尺，使顧客無擁擠之患。</p>
<p>頭層臨街三面，上有假二層，作職員休憇及存物之用，中部空井的一百三十尺方，掙高十九尺，地位寬敞，空氣充足。</p>
<p>百貨公司及商店之內部裝飾，皆以平淡調和為主，蓋顧客之注意者為貨品，而非屋宇也，故除地面鋪意大利雲石，平頂素雅採用新式搆造法，除大樑外，免去一切小橫樑，</p>
<p>二三四層</p>
<p>皆買貨塲，每層地面的有三千四百平方尺，樓梯四處，電梯三具，自下層直達，每層有男女厠所設備，內部櫃架間隔，皆經愼密研究，始行裝置，</p>
<p>四層南部，為大新公司寫字樓，西部為貨倉，東部設茶室，中部作商品陳列所，為顧客購物之指導，及國貨廠家之宣傳，此又大新公司對於上海社會之特別大貢獻者，</p>
<p>五層至頂</p>
<p>四層皆為公衆娛樂部份，卽游樂塲，按現在計畫，玉層備作大劇塲之用，六層為電影塲，其餘分作各種游藝，關於各層上落，從勞合路及西藏路兩面另備樓梯及升降機四座，不與商場部份連通，</p>
<p>統計全樓娛樂部份，同時可容觀衆二萬人，將來設備完竣，舉行開幕時，可算為上海最大之平民化游樂塲也，</p>
<p>外觀壯麗</p>
<p>百貨公司樓房，當然以龐大勝，故此建築，力求簡潔，略帶中國式，而色彩濃厚之處，皆在上層，以配合樂園部份，大遮篷下部，為陳列窗部份，用料比較華貴，係用中國黑閃石，上層則用磁磚，務求簡潔，而得永久之美觀也，</p>
<p>建築方法</p>
<p>分期辦理，打椿部份，先行工作，計打一百十尺長椿二百十四枝，九十尺椿八百六十二枝，士木工程計從地脚起，築至屋頂，全部均裝用洋灰鋼骨架子，務求結實，內外墻部份均用空心磗，其他一切材料，如樓板等等，均是防火材料，故全樓均是防火建築，兼可耐久，且全部鋼骨水泥計畫，經詳細研究，用節省辦法，一切樑柱，務求簡單，</p>
<p>其他設備</p>
<p>除土木工程外，仍有電綫暖汽衛生消防等部份，頭層及地窖裝置全部最新式冷氣管子，可使空氣消潔，並易於保存貨物，全樓上下，均冷煖汽風扇，（Unit　Heater）賣貨塲內溫度，較室外高十餘度，可使顧客舒適，各層均設厕所，及衛生用具，而全樓皆裝土別靈架救火管，更可保貨物及顧客之安全也，</p>

<p>— （振翼）</p>
<p>一月三日的淸晨，在凜冽的朔風裹，我和姚君偉先生，到西藏路大新公司的臨時辦事處去拜訪梁秉堅先生。辦事處雖然設在幾間普通的房屋裹，但內部辦事人員工作的緊張活躍，到處充溢着一種幹事業的蓬勃朝氣，使外人踏進了門，便發生新鮮的感覺。梁先生是公司的總司賬，雖然也是廣東人，但因居住在上海多年，所以說出一口流利的上海話，他很謙遜的招待我們休息了一下，便導引我們去參觀新廈。我們先從底層看起，底層的建築，深埋在地下，裏面包括南貨部，參燕部，五金器血部，廉價部，和爐子間等部份。屋的四週，都裝着冷熱的氣管，据說將來不論是酷熱的署天，或嚴寒的冬李，裏面的溫度，總是可以保持在六十度至七十度之間，終年和煦如春，使人感覺得非常舒適。各部份的玻璃櫃台，也都經過周密的設計，每個角度底的接縫處，並不用木製的圓柱，而是用一種精微的金屬來鑲凑，使得走一過櫃台旁的顧客，觀察起內部陳列的貨品時，覽無這，不會阻礙到每個人的視線。在爐子間的隔壁，是一問職員掛衣服的衣帽室，大新公司的職員一共有六百多人，他們有百餘人會經在香港廣州兩地，受過總行枝行實地的訓練，將來服務的時候，一律穿着整齊的制服，每個人按照自已的號數來掛衣服，而且進口出口，有兩處大門，這樣才可以保持看很好的秩序，不會混亂擁擠。底層的地位很是寬暢，光線</p>

<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>空氣都　當的講究，所以置身其間，决不會使人想像到這是地下室。</p>
<p>店面的一層，是銷售禮券，鮮花，罐頭食物，糖菓餅乾，水某，洋酒，雪茄，香烟，照相機料，冷熱水瓶，文房用具，中西藥品，化妝香品，西裝用品草帽，毡帽，棉毛內衣，頭掃梳具，手帕，毛巾，絲毛線襪，女手提夾，雨傘，皮夾，等部份。店面的一層，一共有六扇大門，另外還有一扇門是專通遊藝塲的，因此，將來就是門庭若市，也决不會有進口特別擁擠的後患。自動電梯從地室的一層起，一共有六座，司機的是女職員，電梯門的開關，都由機器自動，用不到司機者的人力，這也是上海少見的新設備。此外，還有一庫電動扶梯，形式同普通樓梯一樣，乘客祇要立在蹬級上，便可扶搖直上，或急趨直下，旣沒有頭暈的感覺，而且是便利靈快。每一級上，祇容一人，一小時內，可載乘客四千餘人。這時，承造道座自動滑梯的外國工程師，剛巧在旁邊，据他對我說，在外國百貨商店或大機關內，應用這自動扶梯的地方，巳經很多，可是在中國，還是大新公司第一家首先來裝置應用。說着他便導引我們試乘，一直經過二樓而達三樓，的確叫人感覺便利，新寄。預料開幕的一天，一定有很多的人好奇的去試乘。</p>
<p>二樓設氈毬，被褥，銀製器血，琺瑯，象牙，各國鐘錶，望遠鏡，眼鏡，樂器，玩物，傢私用具，皮篋，衣箱，福州漆器，玻璃瓷器，電料電燈等部。當我們參觀的時候，瓷器部份巴經陳列妥當，道些釐器都是由公司方面先設計畫新式的花樣，然後到江西去定做，所以不但品質優良，而且式樣花紋方面，也都很現代化二樓有紗羅，綢緞，呢絨布疋，細毛皮貨，中西衣服？京蘇衣邊，婦女衣着，兒童服裝，中西靴鞋等部份。櫃台衣架等設備，極力注意到避免顧客阻碍視線這一點上。</p>
<p>商塲部份連地下室共四層，細察每一層的各種設備，知道他們在建築的時候，的確化了不少的心血所設計出來的。四樓是總寫字間，有幾間採隔離式的建築，這樣可以避免來賓談話的喧鬧聲，擾亂到辦事人員的心緒。在總寫字問前面，有一塊很寬廣的地方，將來頂備作展覽貨品或展覽其他藝術作品之用的。四樓預備設一會食堂，把食品酒英賣得儘可能的經濟，使一般在南京路附近辦事的薪給階級者，可以化很低的代價，到這裹來吃一餐可口的飯。從五樓起，都是游藝塲，我們上去參觀時，工匠們正在勤奮的做裝修工作，一切佈置尙未就緒。將來佈置好了，那未又是百戲雜陳，歌聲婉轉的民衆娛樂地帶。我們一直走到屋頂上，那裹怒吼着裂人指膚的北風，使人戰慄不已。俯瞰着下而，全上海的景物，歷歷在目，路人車輛，像蟣蚓一般的渺小，在塵埃中蠕動着，這眞是一種奇觀。</p>
<p>一共化了兩小時的時問，總算把大新公司的新建築，看了一個大概。最後，便感謝了導引我們參觀的梁先生，帶了滿意的情緒而回去。</p>

<p>— （振翼）</p>
<p>以新式經營方法，現代化建築，在上海市上以嶄新姿態是現的大新公司，在今天開幕了！牠將震動着上海的市塲，在商業的戰塲上活躍，在這不景氣籠罩下的今日，我們對於大新公司的開幕，實滿懷着無窮的熱望，深盼道個大公司的同人，能够實踐到下列的幾點。</p>
<p>（一）努力提倡國貨　我們國家受列强經濟侵略的創痛，巳經有好幾十年了！現在我們的國民經濟，已經瀕於破產的深淵，社會的危機一天天的加深，道個時候我們若再不起來提倡國貨，挽回利權，那末國家覆亡的慘禍，就將迫在眉睫。在這國家危亡到道樣的階段，社會不景氣在潮道樣澎湃的今日，我們覺在不忍問時也不顧有什麼專銷外國貨的百貨商店再產生；但是我們在另一方面，郤是迫切的需要一個大規模的現代化的推銷國貨的百貨商店。大新公司過去在香港廣州，服務社會，提倡國貨的成績，社會人士早有定評，現在我們希望他們在上海，應當更積極的來做提倡國貨的工作。雖然，提倡國貨，道個偉大的任務，决不是推銷貨物的百貨商店，一方面可以單純的担負下來，但我們總是懇切的希望他們儘量的和國貨廠商，取聯合戰線，合作的來做這個工作。我們很知道這幾年來，園貨的出品，進步很是飛躍，有許多出品，簡直是可以壓倒舶來品，但因為推銷者的不得其法，所以就是有好的國貨，顧客也難以辨訊，或者簡直是不知道。以大新公司這樣偉大的規模，積數十年的商業經騐，如果他們能够努力來提倡國貨，那末我想國貨界的前途，一定可以蒙受很大的利益，換句話說，就是可以使社會國家都得到利益</p>
<p>（二）堅守不二價的信用　大新公司索來以不二價，誠實無欺，來做營業的基本原即。我們看到他們在香港廣州的營業事實是如此，而現在上海大新公司的開幕宜言中，又是很確定的寫出堅守不二價眞諦的字句，這是使我們很覺欣慰的！同時，希望他們要永遠的保持這種好的宗旨，不要因遷就了環境而有所動搖。因為交易的原旨，本來是以有易無，各得其所，雙方都不能以欺詐了事。我們古時的商人，很注重信用，誠實，這種好的習慣我們應當保持住。雖然上海的商塲環境，現在已經被一部份利令智昏的商店弄糟，使得賣買者雙方，都是錙銖必較，呶呶論價。但如果大新公司能够堅持這個不二價的信用，來挽回這種頹風，也並不是事實上做不到的事，環境可以用人力來改造，這是每個事來經營者所應具的信念</p>
<p>（三）注意服務道德　中國商店的不注重服務道德，這是無可吾認的事實。我們希望在大新公司工作的同人，今後能特別注意在服務道德上痛下痛工夫，使得一般顧客不問他是購買多少貨品，做了多少生意，都感到滿意，留下一個好的印象。同時可使上海的外僑，也知道我們中國的新式商店，也已注意到服務道德，改變他們對中國商人傳統的惡劣印象。</p>
<p>（四）着重大衆需要　商店旣然是服務社會的，那末服務的對象，應當是社會上普遍的大衆。所以不論在銷貨方面，或設備方面，都應當以適應大衆需要為標準，不要專門為了少數人而着想，因為大新公司總要使得一般平民腦海中，有「大新公司是我們日常生活用品的理想供應處」的好印象，不要使得牠成為袛是社會上少數人的商塲。同時，在道崑窮財盡的年頭，貨物的採購，以實用經濟為原則售價也耍儘可能的减低，實行廉售多銷政策。</p>

<p>最近，祗要你行經南京路新世界附近，便可淸晰地看到一座美輪美奐的巨廈，巍然矗立在南京路西藏路旁邊。這座點綴着都市繫華的偉大建築，便是大新公司的新屋，牠已經使得每一個南京路上的行路人，都要情不自禁的駐足觀仰，發出陣陣的讀歎之聲。承建這座偉大建築的，是馥記營造廠，主持全部建築工程的，是該廠的工程主任金福林先生。為了想使讀者們明瞭大新公司巨廈的建築經過，記者便在前日去訪謁金先生。</p>
<p>他是一個在國內很有聲望的工程專家，雄視遠東兀立在靜安寺路畔的四行儲蓄會廿二層崇樓，廣州的中山紀念堂，首都的陣亡將士公墓，都是運用他的心血所築成的。他在馥記營造廠服務的成績，社會人士早有定評。可是他倒是和藹可親的人，和記者侃侃而談，絕無絲毫不自然的和誇大的表情。他說：『大新公司的新屋，是民國二十三年十一月十九日正式動工的，在二十四年的冬天完工。這塊新屋的地址，是上海最見方的一塊土地。因此當建築時，新屋的底脚（即地坑範圍最大，同時做底脚時，為了避免地皮的走動，所以工程做得儘可能的快，只有一個月便完工。全部房屋建築的骨幹（即鋼骨和木材）都是用的外國材料，水泥及磚頭，都是國貨。全部工程完成得很快，每一層的初步工程，都祇有八天便吿完工，化去的建築費用，一共是一百五十萬元。『大新』的全部建築。是採歐美各國大規模百貨商店的典型而築成的，醫如捲門，自動扶梯，自動電梯及各部份櫃台的裝置，都經過周密的設計而建造的。我們在別家百貨商店中，進去祇見灣灣曲曲，人頭擅動，有時使人找不到要買的東西；但是『大新』的新建築，每層都可使顧客進門便一目瞭然，很容易找到分門別類的貨品，同時因內部設術完善，光線的充足明朗，空氣的調節有度，使人家油然發生一種好的印象，公認為『理想中的百貨商店。』因為金先生公務很忙，所以說到此地，便吿一段落，和記者忽忽握別</p>

<p>沃的斯自動扶梯及電梯　便利顧客　式樣新穎</p>
<p>大新公司之建築。美輪美奐。而新設備之多。允屬指不勝屈。沃的斯自動扶梯。即其一也。該公司所以裝置沃的斯自動扶梯者。厥因該公司百貨雜陳。地位又極為廣闊。非有斯種最新式之扶梯。實不足以應顧客之需耍。且夫裝置該項扶梯之後。貨品亦可迅速傾銷。銷量旣多。售價亦可間接减低。故復能惠及顧客也。</p>
<p>該公司計共裝沃的斯自動扶梯兩架。一架自底層至二樓一架自二樓至三樓。外表極為美觀。該兩架均可同時向上或向下。每分鍊所行速度近九十呎。故每小時可以供四千人之上下行動。一日以十二小時而論。可供顧客四萬八千人之應用。而公司營業時間於晚上將近完畢之時。該兩架自動扶梯。即可同時向下。庶幾顧客無勞等候。順流而下。又不煩舉步。其便利與舒適。可想而知矣。</p>
<p>顧客向該公司購貨之時。到處無不便利。即位於二樓三樓之貨品。其購取之便利。與在底層無異。</p>
<p>不特此也。該公司更裝有最新自平式沃的斯電梯。計共六架。五架係供乘客之用。一架係供裝運貨物之用。此種電梯。完全自平式。良以普通電梯。停止之時。往往與地面上下不齊。且管理不易。駕駛上每有運緩之弊。今裝用沃的斯自平式電梯。顧客進出。旣稱便利。管理方面。亦極靈便。一按機鈕。立卽到達指定地點。目下先開下層。今後將全部行動。而有單輸特別快車一架。可以直接上層遊藝塲。該電梯位於南京路西藏路入門處。內部極為寬大。可容二十四人。速度為每分鐘四百呎。更有二架。裝於西藏路及勞合路公司後部。直接可以到達屋頂花圍。</p>
<p>該五架電梯中。裝飾及設備。無不為最新式樣。而該公司店堂。有兩架電梯。能自動開門。利用電氣。非常便利。</p>
<p>各層電梯門外之電梯行動標示。亦極為明晰。與普通電梯。截然不同。斯種電梯之設備。滬上除電力公司有二架。大陸大樓二架。國際飯店三架。及百老滙公寓有數架外。其他公司。並無此種電梯之裝置。可見該公司設備之精。及沃的斯電梯出品精良之一斑矣。</p>

<h3 id="c221">「黑人與華人」 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>據十二月十六日路透社柏林電，中國駐德公使劉祟傑，以希特勒所著「我的奮鬥」“Mein　Kamlof”一書，內有一章將「黑人與華人」並列而論，使中國人難堪，向德宣傳部提出非正式的抗議。這本被稱為國社黨的聖經出版已有許多年了，幷且已譯成了中文，劉公使在任也有兩年了，到卸任離德的前夕纔提出交涉，人們就使不說劉使對于華人的體面太不關心，也未免有放「起身砲」之請吧？</p>
<p>不過我們的感想却不是這樣。——</p>
<p>人種謬說本來就是帝國主義者奪取殖民地的一種藉口，國社黨更藉牠來移轉國內人民鬥爭的目標和加强德國要求恢復殖民帝國的理由。國社黨的政綱，牠的政府的法令（特別是最近頒布的排猶法律）希特勒戈倍爾等傾袖的演說，都證明國社黨心目中的文明人只有阿里安人種而德意志人更是阿里安人種中的量優秀者，所謂「德意志凌駕萬國」“Deutschland　ueber　Alles”已成為他們的黨歌中的得意之句。中國旣是像黑人的非洲那樣做過德國的殖民地，中國人又是黃臉孔「黑人與華人」并列而論，是很自然的事。</p>
<p>不錯，當中德互換大使，在其他方面也彼此極力交歡的時候，在不知再版若干次的德國元首的名著中，還留有那樣的一章，的確有乘親睦邦交之旨。怪不得劉使一提出交涉，代宣傳部長芬克氏卽「歉然」答應在下决出版時取消或修正。可是，不要說「外交辭令」與帝國主義的殖民政策可以幷行不悖，卽使這部「聖經」裹頭以後再沒有損及中國人體面的話，中國的在國際上的地位是不是沈從此增高，「第三帝國」是吾就不把中國來當作黑人的非洲看待，而欲嘗一嚮，還是一個大大的疑問。</p>
<p>要知道從歐戰打敗出來的德國，始終沒有忘情于中國的，說起靑島來，好些德國人還是猶有餘憾，饞涎欲滴，更不要說那公然提出殖民地要求的國社黨了。中德邦交誠然親睦，但是日德邦交還更親睦一點，報紙上盛傳的德日密約和中日糾紛發生時國社黨機關報袒日的論調，反證出德國對中國的拉攏，骨子裏是怎樣一回事。</p>
<p>其决，因「黑人與華人」並論，就指為侮辱，卽是暗示自己也承認黑人為天生賤種，不應與有五千年文化的堂堂中華民族聯在一塊，以聯合世界弱小民族來號召的現中國，似乎不應懷此帶有帝國主義者奧味的人種謬見。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>最後，事實上中國人在外國社會上的地位，不見得比黑人高。北美有黑人　聚的特殊區域GhEtto，三藩市倫敦也有唐人街，黑人是美國電影片中的嘲笑侮辱的资料，Chinaman的辮子和鴉片烟槍也是美國以至德國烏發影片中的惡意的點綴品，而且在美國前次的選舉中候選的總統之一就是黑人，最近黑人國的阿比西尼亞拼命抵抗意大利的侵略，不接受帝國主義者的調停方案，比中國還勝一籌，更是我們所共知共認的事實。說句笑話，前一些時中國有些租界公園還掛着「狗與華人不得入內」的牌告，可是在一些帝國主義者的眼中，華人還與狗並列而論呢。</p>
<p>可是，我們不是說，中國對于帝國主義者的侮辱要逆來順受唾面自乾。恰恰相反，中國因為外國對中國人歧視的措施與言論而抗議的地方正多着呢。不要說南洋美洲的排華法律，就是以筆者所知，匈牙利之不許中國人入境，德國對於浙江青田帮小商人的逼害甚至投入獄裏，也是應該交涉的。至於更大的壓迫和侵略，我們之應像黑人國的阿比西尼亞那樣誓死抵抗，更是不言而喻了。</p>
<p>偏偏現在的交涉，起于羞與黑人為伍的偏見，不獨暴露出阿Q的精神，而且也有點立言不得體吧</p>

<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>我到老甫曼村，已是過年的時候了，村里在狂歡里蕩漾着，嘉年華會是快開了，全Manila正在忙碌着選花后。這村，也和瑪那地一個樣，有一條小小的街道。和我們緊鄰的，是一家在一九二五年退職的老議員開的朱西理店。這老議員的兩隻眼睛已經瞎了，整年地拄着拐杖，坐在店中大聲的向顧客們叙述他光榮的過去。議員夫人還只是一個三十五六上下的中年婦人，有兩個十七八歲的女兒。這一對摩登姊妹，從聖誕節到來的那一天，便從櫃台里抬出一架半舊的留聲機器，整天關在房子里開放着，疯狂的和着那淫蕩的歌曲，大聲的唱着舞着，以至於全村都能够聽到。</p>
<p>老議員坐在團椅里，失神地聽着，霎着邢罩着一重白膜的盲了的眼珠子，嘴里浮着微笑，用拐杖在地下按和着它們底拍奏輕輕的敲着。議員夫人也現得很亢奮，在那到處充塞着橱櫃的狹隘的店中，不安地團團的竄鑽着，而店門外則擠滿了農民，婦女和小孩，他們都愕着眼睛，張開嘴巴，失神地聽着，有幾個從酒排間跑出來的，半跛簸着跑，也低低的用哭啞的破聲調和着唱，而且在街心舞動着起來。</p>
<p>末了村巡警長松奎也來了，他轄達地慢慢的在街上踏着輕快的步代，那一套燙得筆直的黄色制服，在柔和的陽光下，微微的燜灼着。</p>
<p>人們忙讓開了條路，讓他跑進去，他讓恭地向議員夫人打着招呼，又向老議員問好，老議員興奮地顫着手，大聲呌着：「老友，多天不見了，怎麼，業務忙碌了、……」推開拐杖，從團椅里站立起來，走上一步，張開兩手，警長松奎便投到他底懷里；於是乎他們便互相擁抱起來。一會留聲機聲突的咽住了，兩姊妹從房里聽到，以為有貴客高臨了，於是便半裸着身開門出來，看是松奎老叔，便露着不快，又重新跑進去，跟誰賭氣也似的略嘟着嘴。終於連店門外的觀衆也一個一個的散走，而這條小小的街，便又復沉着而靜穆下去了。</p>
<p>議員夫人也抽着空到房子里去，留住老議員看店。老議員邊和藹地微笑着，邊拉緊了警長問道：「老友，怎的，這一向不常到我們這兒來？眞的，上帝在上，我是無時無刻不在想念着你哩！我常兀自這麼想着，又問着羅莎底媽說：怎的松奎老叔這一向沒到我們這兒來？怕是我們招待的遲慢，他生氣不來了，她便說：松奎老叔是什麽樣人，不會怪我們的，怕是業務忙，分不得身！眞的，老友，你是太忙了……」</p>
<p>「忙倒沒有什麽，不過新近為着一件搶劫案在奔跑着，……」松奎警長冷冷的答着。</p>
<p>「搶劫案？又是那一村？……」老議員吃驚地問，兩隻盲眼不安的霎動着。</p>
<p>「是從Manila載着貨來的一輪載貨車，在克普森林地帶發生的。」</p>
<p>「那麼頭緒？」</p>
<p>「已經有好些嫌疑犯被捕，村子里的軻太地跑不了！」</p>
<p>這時在街心沉重的大聲吼着，有一輪載重的馬車通過，這使老議員興奮着，又聯想起正在滿Manila沸騰着的嘉年華會來了。他向松奎警長查詢着又低聲的嘆息道：</p>
<p>「日子是變了，唉！松奎老叔，回想在議院的時候，像在這樣吉利的時日，我們是會多麼地興奮！那時我們有一架自備的皮篷馬車，跑通了全Manila市也沒處找的體面馬車，當聖誕節的那晚，當熱鬧的新年夜，甚至嘉年華會到來的時候，我們便著着華麗的服飾，那時羅莎姊妹還在年幼的時候，便坐在我們底兩邊。馬車夫，扶金這個小黟子嚴肅的坐在御者台上，回過頭來問道：「老爺，上那兒去？」我於是大聲叱喝道：「可不是和往年一樣上Manila去，木頭！」於是，他掉過頭去，嘴里輕輕的啸着，瘦長的鞭子空中揚着，馬踏着脚走了。在這時我們從車窗里望出來，往往看見在村口擠滿了人，用羡慕的眼睛送着我們，用手向我們揚着。</p>
<p>「但是日子是這麼地變了，災難者換了幸福，為着我這倒霉的眼睛，我被辭退了議員的職務，而且日子也一日一日的過的艱難起來，先是賣掉了我們在崙禮代海濱的別墅，而後連那匹梭騮牝馬也和皮篷馬車一起賣掉了，在這時，我變的是多麼地蒼老！我是永遠再也看不見那體面的皮篷馬車，和扶金這個小夥子被叱罵時受屈的面孔，村口那些擠着用羡慕的眼睛送着我們，向我們揚手的人，也已重新換來了新主。……老友，你想這些已失走了的時日，現在回想起來，該是要多麼地值得讚嘆的啊！……」</p>
<p>老議員說道這兒便悽然了，當松奎警長抬起頭來，也看見這個不幸老友底盲眼里已擠滿了豆大的淚珠。（Manila故事篇二）</p>

<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>——齊東山野小景——</p>
<p>——走哇！趕兔子去！趕兔子去！</p>
<p>劉雙喜背着大批兔網，右手里拿着壞熱胡胡的白薯，一邊吃一邊走，吞下一口就抽空兒含兩聲，到了于七門口，他站住了，扔了白薯底巴，就又喊呌。</p>
<p>雪早就停了，大家都剛吃過早飯，有的在牲口欄給牲口拌草，有的蹲在門口台階上抽菸。年輕人聽見有人招呼去趕兔子，就高興的不得了。忙夥夥的穿上猪皮綁，找着兔網，隨便在院子里拉一條棍子就往街上跑。</p>
<p>一歇兒工夫就有好多人背着網，拉着棍子集在于七門口。</p>
<p>沿着村邊河岸的柳樹行，從冰上斜穿過河身，一直朝天子嶺走去。遠山自皚皚的，田野白皚皚的，斜谷白皚皚的。大家有說有笑，又吵又鬧，像一羣蒼蠅落在白紗糖上似的嗡嗡不休。脚下的雪吱咯咯的響，菸袋鍋里的烟絲混在呼出的熱氣里，慢慢地隨着寒冷消失了。</p>
<p>穿過深谷，松嵐在眼前顯現了，雪壓着松枝，半枯的松針悄悄的藏在枝底，仰望着頭上的雪朶。光溜溜的大柞樹。枝椏上彷彿包了層柔軟的棉絮。沒有風暴，沒有陰雲，太陽光落在雪上，泛出津津的閃光。</p>
<p>到了天子嶺山脚下，人就停住了。</p>
<p>大家亂吵亂讓，有人說就在這里支網，有人說這里不如東坡那道斜坡上，你一嘴我一舌，吵嚷了半天，這是于七說了話，他說憑他的經騐這里是上好的地方。大家也不固執，就動手支起網來。劉雙喜跟小順子藏在網頭的矮松枝底下，穩住身子，其餘的人就拉着棍子向四下跑開，满山充满着喊聲，棍棒敲着松樹，平靜的雪地被蹂躪了。</p>
<p>兔子是最機警最胆小的獸類，牠悄沒聲的藏在沒離地的小栓底下，縮着身子和寒冷戰鬥。當牠聽到人聲喊呌，就驚虛虛的跑開，東跑一障遇着喊聲又折回往西跑，但是西邊一樣的喊聲不止，牠又機警的往沒有喊呌的方向跑去，後邊的聲浪突然高起來，追着牠，牠用了最後的力量不顧死活往前跑，當牠以為逃脱性命時，却鑽在網中被人按住了。</p>
<p>——一共九個！——于七高興的把兔子後腿都拴起來，他鼻尖上滴着清鼻水。</p>
<p>於是大家又集在一塊，收拾網，繫帮帶，抽菸，醒鼻子，咳嗽，等到把網打到肩上，就又有提議，說是再到黃牛山去趕一塲，實在人們都有些疲累了，誰也不願在這寒冷的猛烈地襲擊下再去拚最後的力氣。</p>
<p>人羣在雪地上蠕動，穿過松嵐，跨過深谷，說笑使人忘掉了疲乏。</p>
<p>歸途上，太陽指着正南，村莊的炊烟在寒冷中現出了深灰的顏色，飢餓在人羣中跳動。</p>

<p>舅父的週年忌，我懷着一顆悽痛的心從車站下來坐車直達舅父的家里。舅父家從前是邑中的望族，雖然到舅父手中已是遠不如前了，但是那所五進的大住宅仍巍然地傲視着，護莊橋也是常年修葺如新。車在護莊河邊停下，遠遠就望見兩扇牆門上的門麻在寒風中飄揚。我踱過護莊橋，莊前的路徑上鋪满了新落的枯葉，好像今天早上就沒有人從這里走過似的。走近門前，牆門虛掩着，我直走進第三進，那是正廳，四壁懸着的輓聯輓幛都褪了色。我呆立着，想起舅父的生前，僅僅一年時光，舅父一死什麽都死了！穿進側院，老媽子纔像如獲珍寳似的喊了起來：「甥少爺來了！」</p>
<p>她告訴我舅母臥病在樓上，已兩個月沒有起床了。少爺什麽都不管，每天攤開手向太太要錢。老媽子掛了兩顆清淚引我到樓上。舅母彷彿早已聽清了我的聲音，撑起半截身子等着我。她招招手要我坐到她床前去，還像小時候一樣，一見我伸過手來摸摸我的面頰，顫聲說：「還有你想着舅舅的週年，」</p>
<p>這一年來舅父家里的情形我從同鄉那里探得一些。舅父生前好行善舉，放在外面的債欵都是沒有契據的；而在周轉不靈的時候他却寗願舉債，舅父一死，舅母變賣了田地來償還的，放在外面的錢呢，自然毫無着落。我的表兄又是不務正業，但是意料中的舅父的家還不致慘落到這般地步，舅父的週年忌日竟至沒有一個親戚朋友來憑弔！我低着頭，不敢正視舅母，偷看她的瘦弱的手腕，我後悔多此一行了，由於我的不遠千里而來，或許更使舅母傷心吧！</p>
<p>老媽子是舅父家里的老傭人，她或者也有一腔的委曲要向我伸訴，時時對我飄着眼風；但是做太太的舅母沒有開口。半響，她說，「甥少爺跟太太談談，我到樓下去煮茶。」</p>
<p>舅母接着嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「虧了她，我沒有病死！不知作了什麽孽，留下這個寳貝，你舅舅做了一世好事，落得這般收塲，還有什麽話說！」舅母的精神似乎亢奮了一點，又伸過危顫着的手，撫摩我的頭髮，「你還沒有知道昵，舅舅死後，幾乎每天有人上門討債，對於錢財的進出，我是向來不與份的，你舅舅吃儉用，到臨死他還强撑着裝做沒有病，他是捨不得請醫生！看看罷，一死之後，還像個什麽樣子！那個寳貝只曉得伸出手來要錢，我病了兩個多月，他不知道請個醫生，到我房里來就是要錢。現在比不得從前了，人頭又是這樣壞，舅舅什麽地方虧待了人，第一個週年忌就沒有一個鬼上門，想想祖宗這份產業不是容易掙起來的！」</p>
<p>舅母聲音愈提愈高，她心頭所積壓着的怨彷彿在這機會中要發洩一個痛快，撫摩着我頭髮的手使了勁，幾乎想抓着一件東西來出氣似的。我忍着眼淚，</p>

Therefore, the central department is also conducting specific research. The basic elements of the garrison expansion plan on which the local and central authorities agree are as follows:</p>
<p>The commander of the North China Garrison is currently a major general of the brigade commander level, so a lieutenant general of the division commander level or a division commander will be appointed. The headquarters of the North China Garrison will be expanded, modeled after the Taiwan Army headquarters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the personnel changes in March, the opinion to replace Commander Tada with a lieutenant general was relatively strong. Therefore, the specific plan for expansion will also be decided within March, and funds will be requested through a supplementary budget. (9th Dispatch from the Denstu News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The New U.S. Neutrality Act and the Oil Embargo Problem <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The proposal by the countries of the League of Nations to ban the transport of kerosene to Italy has been around for a long time, but it has not yet been implemented because the oil embargo is related to the fate of Italy, Britain, France, and other countries. Before taking this unprecedented risk, careful consideration is necessary. Italy believes that an oil embargo is tantamount to a formal declaration of war on Italy, because Italy's airplanes, warships, cars, and tanks all rely on gasoline as power. Italy itself has no oil mines. The cutoff of the source of oil is tantamount to strangling Italy to death. Taking the risk, Italy's airplanes are already prepared to make the final sacrifice and throw their people and bombs onto British warships in the Mediterranean Sea. The decisive battle between Britain and Italy is bound to be a direct result of the oil embargo.</p>
<p>However, what Britain is considering is not Italy's determination, but the attitude of the United States. If the United States, according to the current Neutrality Act, does not prohibit the export of items such as kerosene and cotton, but insists on the traditional freedom of trade, it will inevitably make Britain hesitate to act rashly. If Britain implements an oil embargo against Italy, and the United States continues to supply Italy with kerosene, the sanctions will inevitably be ineffective. If Britain blocks U.S. oil tankers or blockades the Italian coast, the United States will inevitably use the excuse of infringing on the trade rights of neutral countries and conflict with Britain. The joint action of Britain and France against Italy is already feeling insufficient strength. If the United States interferes, not only will there be no guarantee of victory, but the outcome of the war is beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>Recently, the U.S. President, in view of the need for passive cooperation between the United States and the countries of the League of Nations, submitted an amendment to the Neutrality Act to Congress on the 3rd of this month, advocating the expansion of the provisions of the Neutrality Act prohibiting the export of munitions to items such as kerosene and cotton, so that when various countries implement an oil embargo against Italy, U.S. kerosene traders have no right to interfere and avoid the U.S. flag disrupting the collective action of Geneva. This new proposal still maintains the old neutral attitude on the surface, that is, the oil embargo is implemented against both belligerent countries, not just punishing Italy alone. However, in fact, because the countries of the League of Nations are still supplying Abyssinia, the United States' failure to help Abyssinia is of little importance. Italy is being resisted by more than 50 countries of the League of Nations. If the United States also prohibits the export of kerosene to Italy, Mussolini will become a solitary figure in the world, and Italy's airplanes and warships will become bloodless corpses. Therefore, the new Neutrality Act proposal, in its actual effect, is quite beneficial to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the motive for the U.S. neutral new proposal is not in Europe but in Asia. The Italian-Abyssinian war has no direct relationship with the United States. The United States has no hatred for Italy, and no love for Britain, France, and the League of Nations. Therefore, it is willing to sacrifice its traditional maritime trade freedom and the advocacy of neutral country rights and promote the success of collective international sanctions. The United States knows that Japan will inevitably become Italy's second, and once the East Asian war breaks out, the League of Nations and the United States should also take the same steps to make the aggressor country cautious beforehand and able to comply as soon as possible afterwards. In Roosevelt's speech to Congress, there were words severely criticizing aggressor countries, and the affairs of Asia and Africa were also mentioned in the same breath. If the League of Nations' proposal to ban oil to Italy is realized early due to the determination of the United States, it will be beneficial to punishing aggressor countries and promoting collective peace.

<h3 id="e13">The Ministry of Finance Stipulates Temporary Use of Current Coinage for the Close of the Lunar New Year <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Businesses Receiving Current Coinage Should Immediately Exchange for Legal Tender and Not Hoard It</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance in Nanjing recently sent a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the governments of various provinces and cities, stating that now is the period of the grand close of the Lunar New Year, with frequent commercial receipts and payments. In places where legal tender is in circulation, legal tender should be used for payment from now until Lunar New Year's Eve. However, because the supply of legal tender is insufficient, it is temporarily allowed to pay with current coinage. In places where legal tender is lacking in circulation, it is also allowed to receive and pay with current coinage for convenience and to show consideration. However, after businesses receive current coinage, they should immediately hand it over to the nearest legal tender exchange agency to exchange it for legal tender and must not hoard or conceal it, causing inconvenience. As for military police in various places, for people carrying current coinage to purchase goods and for business staff carrying the current coinage they receive, if they are not collecting, trafficking, or carrying it for profit, they should still investigate and handle it according to the regulations previously telegraphed by this ministry.

<p>London. At yesterday's meeting of the General Committee of the Naval Conference, the Japanese delegation expressed objections to the proposals of France and Italy to exchange warship construction programs, bringing the Naval Conference to the verge of collapse. According to our naval correspondent, the British delegation will visit the Japanese delegation this afternoon in a final attempt to salvage the Naval Conference. At that time, the British delegation will present three measures to pressure the Japanese delegation, namely: 1. If Japan resolutely refuses to join the UK, US, France, and Italy in forming a five-nation agreement, then the UK, US, France, and Italy will proceed with negotiations and sign a four-nation agreement. 2. The clauses of the Washington Naval Treaty regarding the cessation of fortifications on Pacific islands will automatically become invalid. 3. Since Japan insists on naval issues, economic issues will in practice be impossible to discuss, and Japan will therefore be isolated. In the future, even if other countries want to negotiate other issues with Japan, it will be difficult to start. However, the general public still believes that this British effort holds little hope. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London. The British government expects that when the Japanese plenipotentiary withdraws from the meeting, it should still ask the representatives of the United States, France, and Italy to find ways to participate in the conference after the withdrawal. There is currently news from outside that the above-mentioned news, but the US delegation etc. do not have such concerns, because they believe that the representatives of the United Kingdom and Japan still seem to have a glimmer of hope in informal consultations. However, in the end, the agenda of the First Committee's meeting on the 10th has actually been completed, and the quantitative limitation plan, the warship notification plan, and the qualitative limitation plan will be finalized with a decision next week. In the end, the fourth part of the London Treaty, the Restriction on the Use of Submarines, has not achieved any results except to make it an independent clause, and the meeting will be adjourned. As for the re-correction of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty, the limitation on the defense of Pacific islands, the Japanese plenipotentiary delegation expressed its approval, but the facts of how it should be done and whether we will raise this case are still undetermined. (Domei Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London. The Japanese representative refused the plan proposed by the British, French, and Italian delegations for countries to exchange warship construction programs with each other for several years, and firmly insisted that countries should recognize Japan's demand for a common maximum limit. This matter has plunged the conference into a state of impending collapse. The other delegations, including the United States and the British Dominions, have expressed their approval of the principles of the British, French, and Italian plan. The conference is now adjourned to Friday, when it will consider whether it is worthwhile to continue exploring other avenues to seek compromise. In today's meeting, the British chief delegate, Naval Minister Monsell, and the Japanese chief delegate, Admiral Nagano, had a heated exchange, which was caused by the attitude of the Japanese representative. At the beginning of the meeting, Nagano declared that Japan would not discuss other plans until the issue of quantitative limitation and common maximum limit was resolved. He believed that exchanging warship construction programs in several years was not a quantitative limitation. Monsell replied that the exchange of information plan had been included in today's agenda. If the Japanese representative did not want to participate in this discussion, he should have announced it earlier, and should not have suddenly said this. Other delegations all expressed their unwillingness to change the agenda, so they still discussed the plan proposed by the UK, France, and Italy. All delegations supported the principles contained therein, but Nagano declared that he considered this plan inconsistent with the spirit of disarmament. Before the next meeting, the delegations will hold bilateral talks to explore the possibility of reaching any kind of compromise. According to experienced observers, the British, French, and Italian plan can serve as a good basis for a compromise between European countries or even the United States. However, the British representative is still unwilling to give up hope for a five-nation agreement. After the adjournment today, it was heard that the French representative plans to visit the representative tomorrow to mediate. On the Japanese side, it was declared that as long as the opportunity for military reduction can be negotiated, Japan is willing to cooperate sincerely with all countries. However, it is heard that if the conference decides on Friday that the common maximum limit requirement proposed by Japan cannot be discussed, then the Japanese representative will ask Tokyo for instructions on whether to continue participating in the conference. At the same time, the British government will host a dinner for the delegations of various countries tomorrow night, and Monsell will raise a glass to celebrate the success of the naval conference.

<p>Washington. Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the Navy Department's decision to build new battleships and replace old capital ships has been temporarily shelved to await the development of the London Conference. If the United Kingdom and Japan implement warship construction plans in a short period of time, the United States will also immediately begin replacing old ships. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington. Secretary of the Navy Swanson recently declared, "The unfinished part of the plan to build new ships to replace old ships will not be changed. We are now waiting quietly for the results of the London Naval Conference before deciding on appropriate measures. That is, the budget proposed by the government for the 1936-1937 fiscal year does not include special funds. If necessary in the future, the Navy Department can ask Congress for additional funds, which is not difficult." (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Singapore. The joint naval and Royal Air Force exercises outside the port of Singapore have recently ended and have yielded valuable strategic lessons.

<p>London. The Naval Conference's General Committee met in the afternoon to discuss the proposals made by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy regarding the exchange of information on warship construction programs. Japan has expressed opposition to these proposals, making the prospect of a compromise even more remote. At today's meeting, the British representative first delivered a speech, saying that the objections previously raised by Japan to the proposals made by the United Kingdom can also be applied to the proposals of France and Italy. Therefore, these objections have already been known to all countries and do not need to be raised again. The Japanese representative replied that the new proposals of France and Italy are not in line with Japan's claim to achieve naval equality through a common maximum limit, and do not provide for a genuine method of reducing naval armaments. Among them, it is advocated to implement quantitative limitations according to the budgetary capabilities of each country. This method is still feasible. However, this still fails to satisfy Japan's claim to obtain security through naval equality. The British representative then explained that once the exchange of warship construction program information is implemented, any country wishing to launch the construction of new ships can know about it in advance and take preventive measures, or immediately conduct negotiations in the hope of reaching an agreement to avoid naval competition. This method is very good. The French representative then explained the proposals made by his country, saying that this is the minimum condition for naval powers to reach an agreement. France advocates that its warship construction program be notified six months in advance. This method is sufficient to keep the path of negotiation open, and countries can notify each other of warship construction programs within a year without taking measures with a one-year deadline. The Italian representative supported the French view, and the American representative also said that this proposal is worthy of full consideration. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London. The First Committee met at 3:18 p.m. on the 8th. Nagano and Nagai, both plenipotentiaries, and Specialist Committee member Iwashita attended. Chairman Monsell announced the opening of the meeting and presented the British government's declaration on warship construction, arguing that under the current circumstances, there is no way to avoid warship construction competition except by adopting this plan. The representatives of France and Italy also presented their respective notification plans and explained the contents. The representatives of the various countries began to discuss, but the content has not yet left the initial scope. However, Plenipotentiary Nagano, in accordance with the established policy, declared the Japanese government's attitude towards the warship notification plan, saying that from the essence of military reduction, the warship notification plan is only a matter belonging to the second issue. The London and Washington Treaties use this plan as a success for quantitative restriction of military reduction, and the most important thing is to strive for the achievement of quantitative restriction first. If there is no special topic for deliberation in the quantitative restriction plan, please deliberate on the Japanese government's common maximum limit issue. After Plenipotentiary Nagano finished speaking, the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and the Dominions unanimously formed a common front to deal with Plenipotentiary Nagano, arguing that the warship notification plan is the main issue of the quantitative restriction plan. Why is Japan avoiding the notification plan, and demanding that Nagano participate in the discussion of this plan? However, Nagano insisted on his own view from beginning to end and did not give in. Chairman Monsell, due to the chaotic arguments, announced that Japan was unwilling to participate in the discussion of the warship notification plan and announced the adjournment of the meeting at 4:46 p.m., deciding to hold the next meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 10th.

<h3 id="e44">Mediterranean and Atlantic - British and French Naval Rotation - First Sound of Collective Action <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>London - The British naval support fleet will withdraw from the Mediterranean, while 91 French warships stationed in the Atlantic will sail to the Mediterranean. Well-informed observers here regard this as the first result of the collective security policy. The rumor of the French authorities sending ships to the Mediterranean has been circulating for a long time. However, the news that four warships of the British Home Fleet sailed back to their country from Gibraltar was quite sudden. Officials are still keeping the Home Fleet's actions a secret. However, Berlin reports that this is part of a grand defense plan of France and Britain, aimed at dealing with Germany and Italy. The authorities have firmly denied this. It is generally believed that the current actions of the French and British fleets are the result of the British government's insistence that if Mussolini takes "mad dog actions," France and Britain should jointly deal with it. At the same time, it is believed that Franco-Italian relations are not very friendly. In Mussolini's eyes, the appearance of French warships in the Mediterranean is not as hateful as that of British warships. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - The French naval fleet has recently been moving along the Atlantic and North African coasts of the Mediterranean. It is believed here that although no agreement has been concluded regarding naval cooperation between Britain and France, the actions of the French navy are to meet the needs of Anglo-French cooperation. According to naval sources, the French naval fleet will likely be stationed near the Strait of Gibraltar so that it can contact the French Mediterranean Fleet when the British Navy needs French assistance. These sources also believe that although the British warships "Hotspur," "Renown," and cruisers "Orion," "Neptune," etc., originally stationed in the Mediterranean area will be withdrawn to their country (as reported earlier), the strategic importance of the British fleet currently stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar will not change as a result. These warships have been stationed abroad for a long time and need to be repaired. To maintain the morale of the navy, their soldiers also need to rest. This is why the Navy Department is recalling these warships to their country. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London - A Navy Department spokesperson stated that the rumor that the British Main Fleet intended to cruise the Mediterranean area was a mistake, referring to the Atlantic. However, the spokesperson did not specify where the fleet would cruise in the Atlantic. Today, newspapers published news of the French naval movement with alarming headlines. Official sources said that this move by the French navy was not at the behest of Britain and was absolutely unrelated to the talks held by the Anglo-French staff in Paris. As for the warships "Hotspur," cruiser "Remillies," "Orion," "Neptune," etc., being recalled to their country, this is also unrelated to the cruise of the French fleet. After these warships return to their country, their defensive duties will be taken over by the warships "Nelson," "Rodney," cruiser "Cairo," and aircraft carrier "Furious." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to the announcement issued by the Navy Department on December 21st of last year, the Second Naval Fleet will soon sail to the West African Atlantic coast for exercises, which will last for several weeks. Because the winter climate in the Brittany waters is severely cold and not suitable for exercises, the exercises were changed to the coast of West Africa. The commander of the Second Fleet is Vice Admiral Darlan. The ships under his command will depart from their base on the 14th of this month and arrive at the port of Casablanca on the Moroccan coast of Africa on the 18th. From there, they will sail to the ports of Abidjan and Dakar in French West Africa and be stationed there until the 26th of this month, and meet with the cruisers "Emile Bertin" and "Courageous," currently stationed in the West Indies. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London - In early December of last year, Britain asked Spain whether, if the British Navy in the Mediterranean were attacked by Italy after implementing an oil embargo, Spain was prepared to immediately assist Britain. The Spanish government has not yet replied to this question. (According to sources, the governments of Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece have already accepted the naval mutual assistance plan.) It is generally known that Spain will submit a reply after the general election in March. Regarding the oil embargo issue, the British government may propose it at the League of Nations Council meeting on the 20th of this month. Member states of the League of Nations should automatically implement a mutual assistance system for any new embargo measures and formulate detailed rules for this mutual assistance system as a condition for intensifying sanctions against Italy. However, it is generally felt that Britain does not intend to propose expanding the scope of sanctions on its own. If other countries have such a suggestion, France will support it, but only on the condition that the entire mutual assistance plan is stipulated. Regarding this, some quarters believe that, after Italian planes bombed the Swedish ambulance team on the southern route of Abyssinia, Sweden may be the first to demand the implementation of an oil embargo. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to a correspondent for the Daily Mail in Berlin, after several newspapers in London published news of military cooperation between Britain and France, German political figures paid close attention to this issue, believing that cooperation between Britain and France was by no means temporary and would continue to exist even after a final resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute was reached. "German figures firmly believe that the agreement negotiated by the staff of Britain and France must be effective for a long period of time. The fact that Britain did not sign an agreement with Germany, but directly established a mutual assistance plan with France, has violated the obligations that the signatories of the Locarno Treaty should fulfill." The correspondent also said that the German government will soon ask the British and French governments how this mutual assistance plan can be integrated with the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty.

<p>Innsbruck - According to reports from here, 500 Italian soldiers showed signs of rioting today when they departed from Mirano, South Tyrol, to go to East Africa. It is reported that soldiers of the 5th Battalion of the Alpine troops refused to depart, shouted slogans against the government, and tore up images of Mussolini. However, the reactionary soldiers were disarmed. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - The Daily Telegraph's Innsbruck correspondent reported today that 500 soldiers in the Italian Albert Brigade refused to board the train to serve in Abyssinia. The officers immediately opened fire, killing two and wounding several others. It is claimed that only 18 soldiers obeyed orders when the brigade was ordered to depart, the rest were stubborn and tore up several posters of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. At the time, the officers announced that they would forcibly put the soldiers who did not obey orders on the train, but it was still ineffective, so they had to open fire. The soldiers abandoned their weapons at the station, loudly cursing Mussolini and opposing the Italian-Abyssinian war. According to the correspondent, 1,650 newly enlisted soldiers in South Tyrol, formerly part of Austria, have fled into German and Austrian territory to avoid military service.

<p>Addis Ababa - According to official sources, the Danbian area, west of Magar, has been completely recaptured by the Abyssinian army. The Italian army fled without a fight, burning villages along the way. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Harar - Our special correspondent reports that General Banru's troops have recently recovered the Gelai area in the Wogadane region on the southern route, killing several white and native Italian soldiers. Regarding the war in that area, General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces on the southern route, recently announced that he had voluntarily abandoned his plan to attack Harar. However, because the Wei Bai Xibei River flows to the affluent areas of Balile and Sidamo provinces, they will advance along the river. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - There is heavy rain throughout Abyssinia. According to reports from Taixi, the rainy season, which usually lasts three weeks, has now begun. Airplanes cannot operate due to low clouds and poor visibility. The roads are muddy, and automobile transportation is also difficult. Last night's total lunar eclipse in East Africa was seen by many Abyssinians as a sign that the Abyssinian army will win a complete victory. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome - The only important item in the report of the former commander-in-chief of the Italian army at the front is that the Italian artillery fire in the Magar North front has destroyed a large Abyssinian force. According to the communiqué, the Abyssinian army has approached Gabat. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding the way to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, the "Fascist System" newspaper recently expressed its opinion that any peace proposals put forward by the British side are not trustworthy. "From now on, peace proposals should be put forward by the League of Nations. However, because the League of Nations is controlled by Britain, we cannot have too much hope for the League of Nations' spirit of peace. Moreover, the League of Nations rashly declared Italy an aggressor and passed sanctions measures. A big mistake has already been made. If it is not corrected, Italy will still not obey Geneva. If this mistake is not acknowledged one day, peace talks can be initiated by the Abyssinian emperor." (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Rome - At dawn today, an Italian three-engine single-wing Savoia-Marchetti combined Italian plane, carrying an Italian aviation official and Prime Minister Mussolini's pilot, departed from Eritrea, planning to fly over French and British Somaliland and Abyssinia to reach Italian Somaliland. According to aviation experts, until now, military planes wanting to reach General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces on the southern front in Abyssinia, could only be disassembled and transported by sea. It takes time and requires the supervision of aircraft engineers to reassemble them at destination. If the Italian army's current test flight is successful, the entire bomber squadron can fly from the northern front to the southern front, which is of great significance to the war. Italian aviation personnel are quite worried about whether accidents will occur when Italian planes fly over British and French territory. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa - Italian planes dropped leaflets and pamphlets in Amharic over the northern front, calling on the people of the northern provinces to break away from the Abyssinian government. The leaflets claimed that the central government was filling its pockets with excessive taxes and levies, causing the people's economy to go bankrupt. They also said that the government in Addis Ababa had no right to call itself the government of all of Abyssinia, so there was no need for Abyssinians to sacrifice for one king. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>French Djibouti - Regarding the rebellion in Gujian Province in northwestern Abyssinia, a person recently arrived from Addis Ababa said that the situation in the province is currently quite difficult, and the unrest has expanded. The leaders of the rebels are General Audah Qiao's son, General Hailu, nephew of the commander of the northern column. Although the Abyssinian Emperor has dispatched General Yijialuo from Addis Ababa to lead troops to the province, and also transferred Generals Pitudet and Makennon from Wallega Province to lead troops to suppress the rebellion, it seems that the unrest has not yet been quelled. However, this rebellion should not be seen as taking Italy's side. However, General Hailu and others have long been enemies of the Abyssinian Emperor, and now they are taking advantage of the foreign war to betray the court again. The rebels were originally preparing to go to the front lines, so they are well-equipped with sophisticated weaponry. Who knew that a change would occur along the way, causing the situation to be quite serious. The King originally planned to personally go to the front lines to supervise the war, but now he has had to stay in Taixi to quell the internal unrest. A large number of troops are currently being deployed to Gujian Province from the capital. (Havas, 9th)</p>

Regarding the bombing of the Egyptian Red Cross ambulance team by Italian planes in Daga Pubo, on the southern route, on the 4th of this month, he stated, "The Egyptian ambulance team was located in Pural, near Daga Pubo. All Red Cross signs and the team's special signs were displayed. However, Italian planes dropped five bombs in that area on December 31st of last year. The landing points were only a few meters away from the ambulance team. On January 4th of this year, two Italian planes bombed the military camp in Pural and dropped two bombs on the Egyptian Red Cross ambulance team. Although no one was injured, the material losses were quite significant. Fearing another bombing by the Italian army, the ambulance team moved the wounded they had taken in to Jijiga." The prince also said that the original commander of the Egyptian Red Cross ambulance team was American doctor Huffman, who was tragically killed in the accident. He was succeeded by Egyptian doctor Raphael. The doctors of the team have not left Daga Pubo and will continue to serve there. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>London - The Royal Civil Servants Association recently held a meeting here to discuss the prospects for future wars in the Far East. Sir Arthur Hyde, who served as a consultant on Chinese issues to the British government and a political advisor to the Chinese government, delivered a speech, saying, "Judging from the current situation, we dare to say that a Russian-Japanese war is inevitable. As for Japan and the United States, although I do not believe that war is possible, the situation is tense, and it is on the verge of breaking out. All the circumstances that could provoke a Japanese-American war will also drag our country into the vortex. Most of our people hold friendly attitudes towards China, but most civil servants may have different opinions. I believe that our country's relationship with the Far East has reached a critical period. We should take our country's interests as the premise in this situation." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun reported that since the breakdown of the Manchu-Mongolian Conference and the establishment of the Anti-Communist Committee in North China, Outer Mongolia's policy towards Manchuria has become more active, resulting in frequent conflicts on the Manchu-Mongolian border. According to information received by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs from various sources, the Soviet Union has assembled a large army in Outer Mongolia, preparing to wage war against Japan and Manchuria. Specifically, in the southern part of Hunan in Poland, Outer Mongolian troops have moved eastward. According to news from Europe, the Soviet Union has issued military mobilization orders centered on Kulun. The number of troops stationed in Kulun is about one division. Combat troops are also being dispatched to other border areas one after another. Two hundred aircraft are coordinating intelligence between Moscow and Khabarovsk. Therefore, the atmosphere on the Manchu-Soviet border is extremely tense.</p>
<p>According to the Hochi Shimbun, the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that key members of the Outer Mongolian government are currently staying in the Russian capital to discuss various confidential matters with the Russian government authorities. The Russian authorities said that they intend to enhance friendly relations between Russia and Mongolia and have no other intentions. However, it is noteworthy that representatives from the three countries surrounding Outer Mongolia are simultaneously meeting in Moscow. Poland and Germany are speculating that the recent establishment of the Jidong Autonomous Anti-Communist Council and the Jidong pseudo-Anti-Communist organization in North China have a direct impact on Outer Mongolia. Therefore, in response, they are expanding military agreements with Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>Moscow - Japanese newspapers carried Changchun dispatches stating that the Kwantung Army announced that "On December 28th of last year, six Soviet bandits intruded into Manchurian territory near a small mountain north of Yangshengzi on the eastern border of "Manchukuo" and abducted 26 Manchurians and six horses back into Soviet territory." The announcement also stated that "The place where the Manchurians were abducted is clearly Manchurian territory."</p>
<p>TASS is now instructed to declare that the above announcement by the Kwantung Army completely distorts the truth. According to a subsequent investigation, the truth is as follows: on December 28th of last year, 28 Manchurian loggers were ordered by contractors to cut timber for the Japanese military police near the Pan Huan River. They intruded into Soviet territory between the 23rd and 24th border defense battalions southwest of Tu Heluo Ge and cut Soviet timber in the Shiremetiev Valley. They stepped into Soviet territory 1.5 kilometers. They cut a large amount of timber and were immediately detained by the Soviet border guards and handed over to the border commander. TASS has also learned that a team of 15 Japanese and "Manchu" soldiers appeared at the logging site on January 4th. They penetrated 300 meters into Soviet territory. They saw the Soviet border patrol from afar and immediately retreated into Manchurian territory. The Kwantung Army Headquarters must know the reason for the loggers' detention. Therefore, its announcement is undoubtedly a deliberate fabrication. (TASS, 9th)</p>

<p>London - A large number of US dollars were sold off today, especially by China, so the price of the US dollar against the pound and the franc fell. People are afraid that the US President may continue to lower the value of the currency to 50%, which the President has the power to do. Today, the US dollar opened at 4 shillings, 9 pence, 3.625, then plummeted to 4 shillings, 9 pence, 5.375, before recovering slightly. Because the US budget cannot balance its income and expenditure, and must raise 6 billion yuan to meet contractual obligations regarding agricultural subsidies, people believe that the US budget situation will become even worse. The US authorities may arbitrarily inflate the currency to cope with the difficulties. The recent move to purchase silver from China and Mexico with US dollars has also weakened the US currency base.

<p>London - Silver market brokers recently expressed their opinion that the world silver market has now stabilized and will not plummet again. However, since the United States began purchasing silver from India, a price difference has occurred between the markets in London and Mumbai. Silver from here is being shipped to India to make a profit. As for the United States purchasing silver from the Chinese government, brokers here believe that this move will make it easier for the Chinese government to complete its new monetary system policy and said that British and American banks have accepted the proposal of Chinese policy, and each will exchange their silver reserves for legal tender, showing that most countries are sympathetic to China's monetary reform.

<p>Washington - The Senate Committee investigating the supply of arms and finance during the European War met this morning and obtained evidence showing that a company related to the famous international banker J.P. Morgan sold ammunition, war materials, food, clothing, medical supplies, etc., worth 363,000,000 yuan to Britain and France before the United States joined the Great War.

Morgan purchased rifles worth a total of 194,000,000 yuan for the British and Russian armies in 1915. The Senate Committee has a telegram issued by Morgan, which instructed its branch in London to report to the British authorities on the content of the US government's third note to Germany regarding the sinking of the Lusitania by a German submarine. The telegram was sent six weeks before the US third note was issued, stating, "It has been learned from confidential sources that the US President's reply to Germany earnestly requires Germany to first address the moral issues of this matter. US cabinet members attach great importance to this matter. This matter should be resolved by Germany. The United States has no other choice." (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Berlin: Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will visit Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, in the coming days. Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt will also visit Budapest, the capital of Hungary. Diplomatic sources here speculate that Austrian foreign policy has shifted due to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The Austrian government believes that Italy's strength has been weakened by its war against Abyssinia, and the value of Austria's friendship with Italy has diminished. Therefore, Austria intends to seek support from the Little Entente countries to maintain the "Anschluss" (union with Austria) objective. As for Foreign Minister Schmidt's visit to Hungary, it is mainly to reassure Hungary, which may feel uneasy after Austria's closer ties with the Little Entente. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington: Today marks the anniversary of the American independent army's great victory over the British army in New Orleans in 1815. President Roosevelt addressed the nation, first mentioning President Jackson's support for democratic republicanism and his deadly battle against the domestic material power opposition. He then stated that in the past thirty-four months, history has repeated itself, which urgently needs to be clarified. Difficult problems have reappeared today, and the facts are more complex than before because the opposition is trying hard to distort and conceal the truth. Regardless of his political program in the future presidential election or who the Democratic presidential candidate is, the preservation of democratic government is the fundamental issue. He recently received letters from thousands of strangers expressing agreement with his statement that only a minority in the business and financial sectors want to resist the freedom of the people. He is very grateful for these letters. As for the Supreme Court's ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) is invalid, he cannot criticize it, but its final result will affect the lives of Americans for many years. In short, seeking justice and prosperity for American agriculture remains the most urgent and unwavering goal of the current government. Since we bear the responsibility of leadership, fulfilling the expectations of young men and women across America is our solemn responsibility. President Roosevelt also said that the United States is not competing with the world, but the battles fought within our borders today are economic, not territorial, and our enemies are the forces of privilege and greed within the country. The American people should know the purpose of their government, and we will never retreat. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington: Since the Supreme Court rejected the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), President Roosevelt has not made any comments. However, today, at the Democratic Party's memorial dinner for President Jackson, he used radio broadcasting to launch a severe criticism of the forces attacking the government's policies. Roosevelt recounted the hardships and difficulties Jackson encountered during the fierce battle with the British army in New Orleans in 1812, and then claimed that the government's current situation is the same as Jackson's. After expressing his respect for the Democratic Party, which elected Jackson as president, Roosevelt called on the people of the country to unite and support the current government's policies in order to fight against the opposition. Although Roosevelt did not explicitly name the opposition forces or mention the Supreme Court's decision, the meaning of his speech was very clear, that is, the court's decision cannot overturn the laws passed by the elected Congress. The President stated that Jackson's struggle for democracy and politics was aimed at achieving justice and fairness. Only in this way, capitalists and newspapers at the time unanimously opposed his policies. President Jackson firmly believed that the decision of the voters should be higher than the decision of the minority representing the power of large assets, and ordinary citizens should have the right to enjoy a better life. However, those who opposed Jackson were the ruthless and cruel people of the time and the traditional forces that were behind the times. In this environment, Jackson sometimes felt that the power of the opposition was all over the country, but in reality, the people of the country were standing on the same front as Jackson. Today's situation can be said to be the same as in Jackson's era. We must maintain the democratic government as the fundamental issue of the future general election. I firmly believe that the American people will recognize the government's purpose and support our policies. We have no need to retreat. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington: The House Agriculture Committee today began drafting a new law to replace the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which was ruled invalid by the Supreme Court on Monday. The committee chairman, Democratic Congressman Jones, claimed that they would be able to devise another plan within the scope of the Supreme Court's judgment to alleviate the suffering of farmers under the current tax laws. The plans currently under consideration by the committee include the following five points: 1. Plans for domestic agricultural products; 2. Subsidy plans for agricultural product exports; 3. Providing financial assistance to states that independently implement adjustment plans similar to the AAA; 4. Allocating funds to rent farmland and temporarily suspend cultivation to restore soil fertility; 5. Providing conditional assistance to individuals who can prove that they are following the production restriction plan. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>— Huang Fu</p>
<p>As usual, the Japanese political season begins in early November after the Army University maneuvers. This year (1935), due to the "clarification of the corporate personality of the state" (團體明徵) issue, there was indeed a stir in the usually "idle" months of August and September. The "weak" Okada cabinet barely issued two statements thoroughly refuting the "organ theory of the state" (機關說), and organized a "Council on Education Reform" (敎學評議會) for the purpose of "renovating education" (文敎刷新), temporarily easing the atmosphere of the "October Coup" (十月政變). After October, the central political circles are usually calm and uneventful during the Army University maneuvers, but this year, the Seiyukai (政友會) caused some turmoil due to their dissatisfaction with the Council on Education Reform. In late November and late December, the formal political season arrived. The former's focus was on compiling the budget for the coming year, and the latter's focus was on dealing with the Diet (國會). Therefore, the "Okada-maru" (岡田丸), manipulated by "Hermit Wani-mizu" (鰐水居士), was always tossing and turning in the stormy political sea, and its future was still shrouded in many worrying atmospheres.</p>
<p>In the past, when the so-called "political parties" were in power, the preliminary skirmishes in the political struggle centered on budget issues were far less serious than the debate battles that began in late December. But times have changed. Since the September 18th Incident (九一八事變), Japan has been experiencing a long and almost endless era of emergency. The struggle against political parties has become secondary or tertiary. The most tense, harmonious, and appealing program in the political season has become the military budget, starring the Ministry of Finance (大藏省) and the military (軍部). Will the 82-year-old "half-immortal, half-mortal" (半仙半俗) Finance Minister Takahashi win, or will the vigorous military win? This is the focus of attention for all of Japan, and perhaps the world.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's military spending has increased sharply every year. In addition to the regular military expenditures such as the army and navy's pay, subsidies for heavy industry, etc., direct military expenditures have already accounted for more than 46% of the total national budget. In order to fill this huge "extraordinary expenditure," Japan has issued "deficit bonds" (赤字公債) that have almost reached the limit. Most of these flood-like bonds are stored in the vaults of the banking industry. It is clear that the most worrying issue for Japanese financial capitalists at present is how to curb the issuance of deficit bonds so that it does not exceed the scope that would cause "malignant inflation" (惡性Inflation). Therefore, the first valuable promise that Takahashi, who is respected by bankers as a "sage" (仙人), made to financiers was the "gradual reduction of deficit bonds" (赤字公債)漸减主義). However, on the other hand, the military believes that the crisis of 1936 is imminent, the Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference held in London this year has no hope of success, the Pacific will be in a state of armament without treaties in the future, and the Soviet Union's second five-year plan has achieved more success than expected. Moreover, it is necessary to urgently implement the continental policy towards China. Therefore, in the next year's budget, they put forward a huge demand of 600 million yen for the army and 730 million yen for the navy (including 340 million yen for the army's new requirements and 300 million yen for the navy's new requirements). According to the original budget plan submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the cabinet meeting on November 26, in 1936 (Showa 11), the ordinary section of annual revenue will be 1,448,000 (thousand yen), and the temporary section will be 789,000 (including 122,000 in ordinary revenue and 666,800 in bond money), totaling 2,238,000 thousand yen. That is, even if 666.8 million yen in deficit bonds are issued next year, the annual revenue will only be 2.238 billion yen. Now, it is really a bit difficult for a clever woman - no, a "sage" - to cook without rice (巧婦——不「仙人」難為無米之炊) to spend the 1.33 billion yen of military expenses requested by the military from these 2.2 billion yen!</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this year's budget. "In the Showa 10 budget, with an estimated 2.2 billion yen, military spending accounts for more than 1 billion yen. Ordinary revenue is not enough to cover expenditures, so 750 million yen in deficit bonds were issued. This is just like a salaried worker (薪水生活者) who earns 65 yen a month trying to live a life of 100 yen a month. The 35 yen that is not enough is debt. Presumably because the times are bad, 47 yen out of this 100 yen is used as 'self-protection fee' (護身費)!" (Showa 11 Asahi Yearbook, page 146).</p>
<p>The "self-protection fee" mentioned here has already exceeded the necessity of "self-protection" in substance and is heavily tinged with adventurous nature. It is not enough to protect oneself, but also to draw the defense line to the neighbor's "inner core area" (內房重地), and even to use the name of self-protection to attack others. Then it is of course within expectation that this salaried worker who receives 65 yen a month is not enough to cover the expenses.</p>
<p>The amount of this "self-protection fee" and the source of borrowing have become important goals of the annual budget struggle since the beginning of the extraordinary times. The political keynote of the Okada cabinet, in addition to the strong naval color, is mainly supported by the "group of senior statesmen" (重臣集團) who have close ties with financial capital and the Minseito (民政黨), which can be regarded as the direct agent of the banking industry. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of the banking industry, the only "sound" (健全的) means is to stop the bond policy (at least a gradual reduction in bonds) and change to "general" (一般的) tax increases. However, general tax increases are not only opposed by the military industry, but the "extremely exhausted" (疲敝已極) rural areas at present also face the danger of being unable to withstand further levies. At the time of the 1934-5 budget, when Finance Minister Fujii issued a huge amount of bonds but was still not enough to meet the military's demands, he proposed a partial tax increase plan. This tax increase aroused great resentment in the military industry and the textile industry. Later, due to the decline in the price of securities, Finance Minister Fujii resigned due to "illness," and the banking industry again invited the "half-immortal, half-mortal" Takahashi to come out of the mountain to serve as a "barrier" (壁障) for the banking industry's pressure on the military. Takahashi Korekiyo (高橋是淸), this 80-year-old man, is not only the elder of the Seiyukai, a senior statesman of the country, and a senior member of the banking industry, but his political weight and prestige have already transcended party affiliation and are considered a "national treasure" (國寳). The banking industry and the business community knew that only he could "speak" (講話) to the military, so after Fujii's failure, they finally disregarded everything and invited this mentally vigorous old man out again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the budget struggle, as usual, each province sets its price, and the Minister of Finance makes a "ruling" (裁定). This year's budget, as mentioned above, the military's asking price is more than 1.33 billion yen, which is clearly a large gap from the Ministry of Finance's original plan. All other budgets have long been ignored by people. Everyone's eyes are focused on the wonderful final act of the old Finance Minister versus the military. In Japan in recent years, there is a popular saying called "Eat him or be eaten by him?" (吃他呢還是被他吃？) This tense scene is very similar to this idiom. After a long period of silent observation, the evening newspaper on November 28 published the statement of Finance Minister Takahashi on the budget policy in large letters. The original text of the statement is:</p>
<p>"From the point of view of the lack of natural resources, it can also be known that whether Japan can be self-sufficient in isolation is still a question. Looking at the world situation, the first country to encounter difficulties in the future is Italy, but Italy still has the support of France. Because of its relationship with Germany, France must unite with Italy. But what about Japan? Japan is encountering the jealousy of various countries due to the significant progress of industry and trade. We should carefully think about our own country! Therefore, the budget should also be compiled according to the income of the people. Financial credit is intangible, and maintaining this credit is the most urgent task. If we only pay attention to national defense, it will eventually cause malignant inflation and destroy credit, and national defense will never be consolidated! In case of an emergency, we should have some preparation and leeway, but looking back at the domestic situation, it is a time of constant natural disasters and withering people's livelihood. There are many places in social policy that are worth considering, and the military is also asked to consider this carefully!..."</p>
<p>The original text is quoted at length, not only to explain the crux of this budget, but mainly because this statement most clearly expresses the attitude of Japanese financiers towards the current international situation. The above Takahashi statement seems to be a matter of course on the face of it, but in modern Japan, only Takahashi Korekiyo can publicly represent bankers to say such things! The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented on this statement: "He dared to say what should be said but cannot be said in the symposium, and what the people should hope for but cannot hope for! The old Finance Minister is still healthy!" It is really not without basis.</p>

<p>Tianjin: The Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office is still in the process of handover. Zeng Yangfeng, director of the audit office, was telegraphed to Nanjing on the 9th to report on the current situation of Changlu salt affairs to the Ministry of Finance. Because the Changlu Transportation Commissioner's Office is separated from the audit office, the budget needs to be compiled separately, and the office site also needs to be found separately. Therefore, it will take some time for it to be officially independent. According to news from the Changlu Audit Office, salt production in the Changlu salt fields will still be transported and sold as usual. The pseudo-Eastern Hebei government once intercepted exports, which was resolved through negotiations. However, the fundamental issue depends on the overall negotiation with the Hebei army. According to Tanggu, there are currently no pseudo-organization personnel monitoring the Caoyan, T'angku, and Lutai coastal salt fields. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou: The food salt cooperatives in various townships and towns in Xuzhou petitioned the garrison command, the commissioner's office, the county government, and the party headquarters yesterday because the Lu'an salt merchants raised salt prices and harmed the people. It was decided to request a reduction in salt prices, the dismissal of anti-smuggling teams, and efforts to promote official salt to benefit the national treasury and the people's food. All parties accepted. In recent years, the Lu quotas in Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Fengxian, Pei County, and Dangshan County have been manipulated by salt merchants, and salt tides have occurred repeatedly. Anti-smuggling teams have disturbed the countryside and even killed merchants in Xiao County, which was settled by compensation. Since the establishment of food salt cooperatives in various townships and towns, concrete negotiations have been made. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>London: The Times published an editorial today praising Sir Clarmann, Counselor of the British Embassy in Peiping, for his recent overland journey from the ancient Chinese capital to Gilgit. It stated that the British and Indian people in general were concerned about the safety of Mr. Clarmann. Now that this news is heard, they can all rest assured. The section of the journey from Kashgar to Gilgit occurred during the worst climate of the year. The local Chinese officials along the way treated him with courtesy, especially Sheng Shicai, which is admirable. It is now hoped that Mr. Clarmann's trip can eliminate the unnecessary and often illegal obstacles imposed by local Chinese officials on British and Indian trade. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>British Gold: Today's London gold price was 140 shillings, 11.5 pence, a decrease of one penny.</p>
<p>British Silver: Today in the London silver market, the spot price was not yet settled.</p>
<p>American Silver: Today in the Monterrey silver market, the opening bid was slightly lower than yesterday, while the asking price was higher than yesterday.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Today in the London foreign exchange market, the US dollar price was weak. The opening US-UK exchange rate was 4 yuan, 9 jiao, 3 fen, 8125, higher than yesterday's US-UK closing rate by 1875. It fell by 125 in the first hour. In the following two hours, merchants were even more uneasy, fearing that the United States would experience inflation. The reasons are: 1. There was a large sale of silver in the market; 2. The US budget is impossible to balance; 3. The US government is about to request Congress to raise funds to repay existing agricultural debts. At 12:30 pm, the British exchange rate was 6875 higher than at 11 am. In the next half hour, it continued to rise by half a fen to 4 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen, 875. At 1:30 pm, it rose another half a fen to 4 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, 375. However, a reaction occurred at this time, so the exchange rate fell by half a fen within 15 minutes. As a result, the exchange rate at 1:43 pm was 4 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen, 875.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: Today's opening price fell by eight pounds due to unfavorable Liverpool telegraphs. Later, due to the continuous spread of inflation rumors, and because the government may propose a substitute rural bill, and at the same time, cotton mills still have a lot of demand for raw cotton, the price stabilized.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Today's sharp drop in the Liverpool cotton market was due to expectations that US cotton loans would not continue. At 1 pm, the January futures price fell by sixteen pounds to 5.90.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: The opening price fell slightly, expressing sympathy for the Liverpool decline. After the opening of miscellaneous grains, there was nothing exciting, and the price was not much different from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: Today, because the US wheat market price fell yesterday, the price here also loosened slightly. At 1 pm, the March futures price was 6 shillings, 5.625 pence, a decrease of 125.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: Today's market conditions are stable. The 1 pm price for April-June futures was 6.8125 pence, the same as yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: Today's opening was slightly better, as peers and speculators purchased, and the price rose slightly.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: This morning's early trading was slightly uneven, with prices fluctuating, but limited to small numbers. Public utility stocks opened lower, and steel, copper, and railway stocks all showed a weak trend. The market price of automobile and department store stocks was slightly higher. Although there is talk of currency inflation, operators are unwilling to make new transactions hastily, because they want to wait for the Supreme Court's ruling on other cases concerning new measures.

<h3 id="e87">Errors in Higher Examination Questions: Examination Yuan Voluntarily Requests Punishment, Central Political Council Resolves to Punish Niu Yongjian with a Month's Salary <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Due to errors in the questions of this year's higher examination, Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, considering his responsibility, specifically submitted a report to the Central Political Council requesting punishment. The Central Political Council resolved on the 8th that, regarding the error in the questions of this year's higher examination, Niu Yongjian, Chairman of the Examination Committee, would be punished with a month's salary. The request for punishment from the President of the Examination Yuan and Chairman of the Examination Committee should not be discussed. At the same time, Xu Mo, a member of the Examination Committee, also felt deeply disturbed that his error in drafting the questions made it difficult to escape the blame for negligence, causing Chairman Niu to take the blame for him. He has already sent apologies to President Dai and Chairman Niu, and made appropriate expressions. The original report from the Examination Yuan is recorded below: Respectfully presented is the report from Niu Yongjian, Chairman of the First Examination Committee for the Higher Examination, dated December 13, 24th year, stating that on November 26th of this year, he received a report from Chen Daqi, Director of the First Examination Office of the Higher Examination, stating, "This morning, during the second test of the higher examination for general administrative personnel, when examining the elective subject of international law, after distributing the question papers, some examinees claimed that the first question on the paper had the words 'territorial' (地域), which was actually a mistake for the words 'easement' (地役), and asked how to answer and whether to correct it. It was immediately informed that this question paper was printed and issued by the Examination Committee. The office had no right to intervene in whether the word 'territorial' was wrong. If the examinees believed that the word 'territorial' in the question was indeed a mistake for the word 'easement', they could answer according to the meaning of the word 'easement'. After this explanation, all examinees were satisfied, and the order was as usual, etc." Upon hearing this situation, Yongjian was extremely alarmed. After investigation, it was found that there were three categories for the elective subject of international law for this type of examination. After discussing with the relevant committee, it was decided that the test papers for this subject would be graded on two questions for the first question, whether it was made incorrectly or not, so as to provide relief. Although the rights of the examinees are not impaired, Yongjian's negligence cannot be excused. The matter has been reported truthfully, respectfully requesting the examination and verification of the report and forwarding it to the National Government for strict punishment, so as to emphasize the examination administration. Not daring to wait in fear for orders, and also according to the report from Chen Daqi, Chairman of the Examination Committee, dated December 15, 24th year, the First Examination Committee for the Higher Examination, when examining the elective subject of international law in the second test for general administrative personnel, mistakenly wrote the word '役' (yi, service) in the term '地役權' (di yi quan, easement) as '域' (yu, territory). Now, the facts of how this error occurred are reported to you one by one. It is said that this higher examination was decided by this committee to hold nine categories, and the category of construction personnel already included ten sub-categories. Later, it was approved by the Ministry of Communications to simultaneously hold special examinations, postal personnel examinations, and senior postal worker examinations, in reality, there were nineteen categories. Each category of examination, in the first higher examination, Chuanxian was ordered to preside over the examination, and the incident of discovering a miscalculation of the score of examinee Liu Xizhang was immediately reported to the National Government and was punished with a fine of three months' salary, and Secretary-General Chen Daqi was fined one month's salary. The discipline was strict, and it was nothing more than maintaining the fairness of the examination, according to the government's clarity. This decision that the word '役' (yi, service) in the international law question of the higher examination was mistakenly written as '城' (cheng, city), although it was a homophonic error, is still difficult to escape negligence. The cause of this incident, tracing back to the end, is that, as claimed by the Examination Committee's report, there are many subjects, the time limit is tight, and there is not enough time for detailed proofreading for question preparation and writing. Moreover, the questions involve various disciplines, and it is difficult for the chairman of the examination committee to know everything. Although he should be responsible for the oversight, it is not without excusable reasons. Chuanxian, who is in charge of the examination administration, really cannot avoid his responsibility. In addition to reporting to the National Government, he should also report to your council to strictly punish Chuanxian and the Chairman of the Examination Committee, Chen Daqi, and the Chairman of the Examination Committee, Niu Yongjian, in order to emphasize the examination administration and show impartiality. Not daring to wait in fear for orders, respectfully presented to the Central Political Council, President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Chuanxian, (January 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Xiamen Taiwanese Purchase Land: Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Redeem <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>—Taiwanese Agree to Redeem at Original Price—</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The land of Maohou Village in Heshan, outside Xiamen City, was sold by Zhou Xingnan, a former official of the Municipal Office, to the Xiamen Ken Zhi Company, organized by Taiwanese Japanese national Lin Tumu, for reclamation, covering tens of thousands of acres. The land is adjacent to the Huli Mountain Fort, a fortress in Xiamen, which is a national defense zone and has long been designated as a national defense forest. The sale to Xiamen Ken Zhi Company has aroused strong opposition from the Xiamen people. Two years ago, the Committee of All Circles Opposing Zhou Xingnan's Theft of National Land was organized, and along with the Taikoo Warehouse case, they repeatedly filed complaints to the Central Government. Last autumn, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Lin Shaonan, a diplomatic inspector of Fujian and Zhejiang, to Xiamen to handle the matter. Except for the Taikoo case, which was handled separately, at that time, Lin Tumu stated that the land reclaimed by the Xiamen Ken Zhi Company could be redeemed by the Chinese side at the original purchase price and the funds used for reclamation equipment. The people of Heshan then sent Chen Junong to Nanyang, Singapore, to raise funds from overseas Chinese from Heshan to redeem the land. After Chen arrived, the Heshan Association in Singapore held a meeting and decided to organize the "Heshan Nanhua Kenmu Company" with a fixed capital of 50,000 yuan, using 37,000 yuan for land redemption and the remainder as working capital to continue reclamation. Twenty-one preparation members were elected to jointly raise shares with Chen Junong. The capital subscribed by the Heshan Association in Singapore has reached 20,000 national currency. At the same time, the Fujian Association in Singapore also sent Zhou Xianrui, Hou Xiyou, and Tang Xiangfan to assist in raising shares. When the full amount is raised, the Heshan Association in Singapore and the Fujian Association have decided to each send a representative to accompany Chen back to China to handle the recovery of the Maohou land and all related matters.

<h3 id="e91">Anxi Mining Exploration Begins <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Seventeen Japanese Technicians Depart by Land and Water: Main Target is the Geography and Overview of Pantian</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The Anxi Iron Ore Exploration Engineering Office, organized by the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, with Director Zhao Xiujin, Deputy Director Lin Zhaojin, technicians Li Qishan, Chen Zilong, Chen Yingjie, and seventeen Japanese technicians from the South Manchuria Railway Company, gathered in Xiamen in late December. Because the Full Steel Chui Mine Diamond Drilling Machine, which was rented from Mantetsu, was transported to Xiamen by the Songshan Maru, it was not taken out of customs until the end of the year, so it did not depart before the New Year. On January 3, the harbor portion was led by Lin Zhaojin and Chen Yingjie, leading Japanese technicians Soma Hideo, Igarashi Daisuke, and Yoshida Hitoshi, departed via waterway, taking the route through Zhangzhou, up the Jiulong River, inspecting water conservancy, hydropower, and harbors along the way, via Hua'an to Zhangping. Zhao Xiujin, Li Qishan, Chen Zilong, etc., led the drilling, surveying, and railway engineering Japanese technicians Kanyao Seiji, Asano Masatora, Sato , Tsuboi Mitsugu, Aratani Kazuo, Sakamoto Shuneo, Tayano Tetsuo, Isohata Sokuro, Nakagawa Kikamatsu, Matsuda Kamezo, Nakayama Takao, Otani Koichi, Yonehana Hiroshi, and Ishida Kiyoshi, and more than twenty clerks and others, set off on the morning of the 7th, crossing Jimei from Xiamen, taking three special cars, and transporting machines to depart, taking the route through Tongan into Anxi, and starting work in divisions. This Anxi mining exploration mainly targets Pantian, because its iron ore is the most abundant, the ore quality is excellent, and it has the value of large-scale mining. According to the investigation, Pantian is 140 li from Anxi County, and the Tongxi road can reach the county seat. From the county seat to Houtou is 60 li, then to Changkeng is 50 li, and then to Pantian is 30 li, all of which require walking. Pantian has two Lianbao, the Fourth Lianbao with 111 households and 521 people, and the Ninth Lianbao with 12 households and 487 people, with only a thousand people, under the jurisdiction of the Changkeng District Office. The economic organization is extremely immature. Except for food, which can be self-sufficient, everything else depends on external assistance. The people's knowledge is simple and the culture is backward, but the iron ore reserves are very rich, and the surface iron ore seedlings are visible everywhere. In addition to this, the only products are wood, bamboo, vegetables, rice, etc. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the transportation is very inconvenient. The stream water is still good. The Anxi waterway can reach Zhangping in the southwest. The engineering personnel, therefore, traced the Jiujiang River to Zhangping, and inspected whether there is a place to set up hydropower along the way for iron smelting. The security of the mining exploration is protected by a large team of the 5th Security Regiment, because Anxi was previously known for its many bandits. (January 8th)</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Seizes Lost Weapons</p>
<p>According to a tip-off, the investigation team of the Public Security Bureau learned that Li Jinxiang, the main culprit in the previous robbery of cars and weapons, had led his accomplices back to his hometown to plot wrongdoing. Yang Shijie, the captain of the team, led his subordinates to the Shui Ke area of Shanyang Township to investigate, but there was no movement. Then, inside a purple coffin, they found two Mauser guns, marked with the numbers "2" and "28" of Xisan Township, Fengxian County, which were clearly the stolen goods from the robbery of the Majing Township guard post. They immediately took them back to report to the bureau, waiting to be transferred to the county government for handling.</p>

<p>Construction of the Ring Road Begins</p>
<p>The county government, in accordance with the order of the Construction Department of the Provincial Government, is preparing to build the South Gate to East Gate ring road for automobiles, connecting the Xihu and Jiahhu roads. The total length of the road is 2.8 kilometers, and its drawings and budget have long been approved. The cost of earthwork for the road surface is 3,255 yuan, which is contracted and undertaken by the Heji Construction Company. Construction started yesterday. The county government has ordered the people to automatically move all obstacles such as houses and tombs on the road. As for the bridge project, the budget is 14,000 yuan, and the road surface paving with sand and gravel is budgeted at 8,000 yuan. Bids are currently being designed.</p>

<p>Enclosing Lake Fields Resurfaces</p>
<p>In the Dongtai Lake area bordering Wuxian and Wujiang counties, a large number of migrant people enclosed the lake to form fields last year, amounting to more than 100,000 mu, which greatly harmed the lakeside farmland in Jiangwu counties. The farmers unanimously opposed it, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent officials to Suzhou to investigate. Together with the two counties, they sent a large number of security teams to armed enforce the enclosing and disperse the migrants, restoring the fields to the lake. Unexpectedly, those migrants, seeing the great profit, were still unwilling to give up. Recently, some people are still filling in the gaps that were removed, which was discovered by the Wujiang County Government. In addition to sending personnel to conduct on-site investigations, they also reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and Construction. At the moment, the provincial government has dispatched Huang Yun to Suzhou to investigate. After Huang arrived in Suzhou, he took a boat to Dongshan in Dongting on the morning of the 9th and transferred to Dongtai Hunan Ku to investigate. He will go to Wujiang again tomorrow to investigate the lakeside fields in the jurisdiction of Wujiang. On the other hand, the Department of Civil Affairs and Construction has instructed the Wujiang and Wuxian county governments to earnestly crack down.</p>

<p>New Developments in Blood Case Investigation</p>
<p>In the Dasong Fentou blood case outside the South Gate, the deceased Lin Jinsheng suffered a total of five knife wounds, which was verified by the court. Now it is known that there are surprising new developments in this case. It turns out that the deceased's wife, Chen A'da, is naturally romantic and does not abide by the virtues of a wife, repeatedly engaging in adultery. In the autumn of this year, she once attempted to murder her husband but failed. This murder case is highly suspicious. Therefore, Lu Zhenru, the head of the 20th Jia of the 3rd Bao in Lihua Town, escorted Chen A'da to the 6th Branch of the Public Security Bureau under his jurisdiction for investigation. After Duan Qishan, the chief of the branch, held a preliminary trial, according to Lin Chen's (ie, Chen A'da) confession, she was seventeen years old. Lin Jinsheng is my husband. He was recruited into my family at the age of fourteen. I lived with Jinsheng at the age of fifteen, and we never formally held a wedding. Around July of this year, while living in Zhouzhuang, I was forced to commit adultery by Lin Senbao, the cousin of Jin Quan. Later, I was instigated by Senbao to attempt to murder Jinsheng with a rope, but I failed. I then went to Suzhou and came to Wuxi on November 13. On the 4th of this month, Jinsheng said that he was going to the countryside to Liyuan to visit his brother Hesheng and was unexpectedly killed, etc. When the woman confessed, she showed no sign of grief, and Chief Duan checked the case lightly and did not pay attention to it. He did not instruct employees to record the confession. After the interrogation, he ordered the head of the Jia, Chen Zhenru, to take Lin Chen back for custody. On the morning of the 9th, Chen Jia sent her to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, so that the truth of the murder case could be revealed.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Exchange Copper Coins for Legal Tender</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance reformed the currency system, hard currency gradually disappeared in Wuyi City, and silver coins also decreased day by day, while copper coins were in surplus. Stores received a large number of copper coins, which could not be exchanged for legal tender for a while, and it was impossible to purchase goods without legal tender, which affected financial circulation. The County Chamber of Commerce reported the above situation based on reports from various industries, stating that it was closely related to commerce and finance. They also found that the Ministry order had issued a general order that people holding silver and copper coins could exchange them for legal tender at the nearest Central, China, and Communications banks. However, the local branches of the Middle Traffic Bank had not complied because they had not received orders from the head office, which inevitably affected finance. Furthermore, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the period of final settlement is crucial. They specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting relief.</p>

<p>Freight Car Coupling Worker Killed</p>
<p>Shi Hanxing, a 41-year-old freight car coupling worker from Zhuji, who had served for many years at the Hangzhou City Station, was working yesterday (9th) at 3:30 pm when the freight car was about to start. Unexpectedly, he was hit hard by the locomotive, and his left arm was broken and his chest was seriously injured. He was sent to the railway hospital for treatment, but he died at about 4 o'clock. He has five or six children behind him, and the railway bureau will provide compensation.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Call for Reduction of Land Tax Surcharges</p>
<p>Sun Songtao and other industry owners of Tongyi jointly presented to the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance, stating that the land tax surcharges in Nantong exceed 8 or 9 times the regular tax, and the people's rent income is not enough to pay the grain. Moreover, the local business expenses are also transferred to the province, which does not match the name and reality. They requested a reduction to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>

<p>Student organizations from Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places formed a delegation to go to Beijing to receive instructions. Yesterday, student representatives from the three regions of Guangdong, Fujian, and Xiamen arrived in Shanghai by ship, one after another. They lodged at the Yang Residence, awaiting a decision on the date of their trip to Beijing, after which they will depart together. The details of their arrival are recorded below:</p>
<p>Thirty-Five from Guangzhou: The Guangzhou Municipality Student Delegation to Beijing to Receive Instructions, consisting of thirty-five male and female students, boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Yuan vessel in Guangzhou at 9:00 PM on the 4th to come to Shanghai. They arrived at the Jin Li Yuan Wharf at the 16th Pier yesterday afternoon. The Municipal Government sent the first section chief, Li Dachao, to the wharf to welcome them and take care of everything. In addition, a Municipal Government vehicle was used to transport the students to the East Asia Hotel. The representatives are from major middle and high schools in Guangzhou, with each school recommending one person to participate, representing Guangzhou students to go to Beijing to receive instructions and petition the government.

After landing, they stayed at the Asia Hotel. The school's president, Lin Wenqing, due to his advanced age and inability to withstand the hardships of travel, sent the dean of the School of Education, Sun Guiding, as his representative. Mr. Sun had already come to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. Yesterday, after meeting with the student representatives from the school, it was decided to go to Beijing to receive instructions together with the Fuzhou representatives.

<p>Date of Travel to Beijing: Representatives from major middle and high schools in Xiamen and Fuzhou</p>
<p>Representatives from major middle and high schools in Xiamen and Fuzhou met one after another at the Asia Hotel yesterday. As for the date of departure for Beijing, it is planned to gather at the Asia Hotel at 1:00 PM this afternoon and then make a decision. Whether to go to Beijing together with the major middle and high schools in this city will also be decided in consultation today. The approximate date of travel to Beijing should be before the 13th.</p>
<p>Representatives Speak: A reporter from the Central News Agency met with the Xiamen University representatives at the hotel. According to them, this student movement was launched due to the tension in North China. However, the situation in South China is also under the control of foreign forces. Taking the situation in Xiamen as an example, although Xiamen is Chinese territory, because it is close to Taiwan, many Taiwanese reside here. The actions of these people relying on their power to bully the Chinese people can be seen at any time. These people pay too much attention to the student movement. If students are more enthusiastic about the patriotic movement, they may be in danger at any time. Therefore, taking advantage of this trip to Beijing, they also plan to awaken the Chinese people's attention to the situation in South China.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, it is learned that foreign banks in Shanghai have agreed to comply with the banking regulations promulgated by the Chinese government on November 4 last year, and hand over the cash they hold to the Chinese government. This decision was not made by a meeting of foreign banks, but by each bank negotiating terms with the Chinese government separately. Those who have now agreed to hand over the cash include HSBC, British Bank, Chartered Bank, Chase Bank, American Express Bank, Mercantile Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Netherlands Trading Society, Citibank. Other banks are expected to negotiate handover methods within a few days. It is heard that some banks are not yet implementing the handover, and will first report the amount of their reserves to the Chinese government in detail, and receive a receipt. Most banks handing over cash will do so with 60% cash and 40% securities, exchanged for legal tender at 100 yuan. It is heard that the Chinese authorities have begun investigating the amount of foreign currency deposited by Chinese people in foreign banks, in order to convert it into legal tender. The total amount of these deposits is more than 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Bank of Communications Adds Trust Deposits <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications in this city has a special trust department, managing real estate, buying and selling securities, safekeeping important items, and acting as an agent for receiving and paying for goods, debts, and tuition fees, etc., for many years. Its business has always been developed. It is learned that the bank is now planning to add trust deposits, divided into ordinary trusts and special trusts, both to be handled by the Shanghai head office and its branches in this city first. The branches in other cities will also be promoted in order. The main points of the method are described below: Ordinary trust deposits are in the nature of agency management, with flexible terms and simple procedures. The amount of each deposit is at least 50 yuan in national currency. After one year of deposit, it can be withdrawn and used at any time. The income earned, if calculated within an annual interest rate of 6.5%, will all be enjoyed by the depositor. If it is outside of 6.5%, then the excess part will be divided equally between the bank and the depositor. Special trust deposits are for the agency of depositors' direct investment. The amount for each deposit is at least 5,000 yuan. The term and scope of use are all freely designated by the depositor. All the net profits earned, after the bank deducts a very small handling fee, belong to the depositor. There is less cost of consumption, and no labor of employing management, while enjoying stable investment benefits. It is heard that the purpose of the bank's handling of trust deposits this time is to use the bank's experience and strength to gather deposits that tend to speculate in society and use them in the path of production. Compared with private operation, it is safer and can save floating expenses. It is indeed a good way out for those in society with surplus capital. It is also known that the bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to allocate 2.5 million yuan in national currency as the trust department's operating fund in order to expand the trust business. All trust property accounts are completely open in order to protect the interests of depositors.</p>

<h3 id="e99">After Sanctions Against Italy, German Shipping Business Booms <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Our country has implemented economic sanctions against Italy, restricting Chinese goods going to Italy, and also implementing a ban on the unloading of Italian goods transported to China. Our recent North German Company's express liners have seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not only is the freight traffic coming and going crowded, but there are even more passengers, and the fares have already skyrocketed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Italian Goods Problem</p>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs announcement of sanctions on the trade of goods to and from Italy, it has been limited that imported goods from Italy to Shanghai that arrive in Shanghai after the first of this month will not be allowed to be unloaded. Subsequently, the Jianghai Customs announced its second decision, and received the revised measures for sanctions on Italian goods from the Central Ministry of Finance. If goods ordered and shipped in December of last year can still be extracted. Therefore, the goods from the Sumatara vessel from Italy to Shanghai yesterday can still be extracted. There is also the cargo ship Hilda, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, because most of the goods it carries left Italy before December 3, and can also be extracted as usual. However, those that depart this month and arrive in Shanghai next month will be subject to the restrictions of sanctions.</p>
<p>German Ships Develop</p>
<p>The North German Company specially built three fast ships last year, originally to compete with Italian mail ships on the Central European route. Since the maiden voyages of the two new ships, Xianghuosituo and Bosidan, the cargo and passenger businesses have still not been as good as the Italian ships. When the League of Nations sanctioned Italian goods, Italian mail ships sailing to the Far East had already suffered an invisible blow. The North German Company's express liners then flourished, and the number of cargo and passengers coming and going suddenly increased. The third new ship "Na Aisi Nu" has not yet been completed, and North Germany has already chartered the "Stuttgart" mail ship, which runs on the Atlantic Ocean, to come to China for a temporary voyage. A telegram was received yesterday, saying that it can arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month, and both cargo and passengers are full, and the business is better than expected.</p>
<p>Fare Increases</p>
<p>When North Germany built three special express ships for the Far East, the first-class cabin fares were priced low. Therefore, the price for traveling from Shanghai to Marseille was set at £102. Now that foreign exchange is more expensive, it has invisibly increased by one-tenth. Recently, due to sanctions against Italy, the passengers on North German mail ships leaving Shanghai for Europe have pre-purchased tickets for three or four months later, and the price has also increased to £110. The prices of other ports and second-class cabins have also increased by £4 across the board. As for round-trip tickets, they have increased by more than £10, which will be implemented starting from the postal ships exported from Shanghai this month.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Chamber of Commerce Submits Another Request to the Ministry of Industry to Expedite Industrial Control <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday urging the implementation of industrial control, saying, "Respectfully submitting a request. The case is that in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China, this association, in order to save the decline of industry, should control production to avoid surplus manpower, and drafted 16 articles of regulations for control, and submitted them to your ministry for adoption. However, since it has not been approved for a long time, on August 23, a document was submitted to urge it. On September 6 of that year, your ministry issued a reply No. 13241, stating, 'The submission has been received. The implementation of industrial control is of great importance to the entire future of industry in our country. This department has long given it serious consideration. The draft regulations on industrial control submitted by the association have been studied together, and the governments of various provinces and cities have been notified to reply. Once they are collected and deliberated, and a concrete plan is obtained, they will be ordered to comply.' The association sees your ministry's care in planning the beginning, consulting widely, and not tiring of seeking details. However, the discussion of industrial control in recent years has arisen due to the needs of the environment. If Jin and Yue have already established regulations, it is better for your ministry to coordinate the overall situation and adapt to the national conditions, rather than the provinces governing themselves, which will cause more obstacles. The opinions of the provincial officials may differ, and building a house on the road may accelerate the collapse of the entire industry. It is also not the grand intention of the state to pay attention to economic construction and plan the foundation of the country. Together, we submit a sincere document and request that your ministry review it, and swiftly approve and implement it for the sake of public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Please Carefully Investigate the Cash Confiscation Case; The Ministry of Finance Replied to Yu Qiaqing Yesterday by Telegram <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Orders have been issued to military and police agencies in various places to comply; if there are deliberate violations, the people should be allowed to accuse them</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, previously, after the Ministry of Finance implemented currency reform, the people in the interior may not fully understand the methods of exchanging legal currency. Therefore, there were times when ignorant villagers brought a small amount of cash to Shanghai to shop, but they were confiscated and fined by the military and police. The villagers mostly contained their grievances. Therefore, on the 23rd of last month, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Finance, requesting them to issue a general order to the military and police in various places to handle the matter with caution. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance, which said, "Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association forwarded to Mr. Yu Qiaqing for appreciation, thanks to your request, please see, after checking, since the implementation of legal currency, in addition to the methods of exchanging legal currency promulgated by this department, it also sent letters to the three banks of China, China, and Jiaotong, and the Post Office General Bureau to sign a contract for exchanging legal currency on behalf of the other, that all postal agencies can exchange legal currency on behalf of them, so that the exchange will be universal and convenient for merchants and people. It was secretly reported that the military and police in various places failed to understand the intention of the law, and often took the opportunity to make things difficult for the ignorant people carrying a small number of coins. The above-mentioned situation should be urgently corrected at the end of the year. On the 7th day of December of last year, this department telegraphed to all provinces and cities and military agencies across the country, ordering the military and police in various places, for people in areas where legal currency is not circulating to carry silver coins to buy goods, if it is indeed not for profiteering, they should not be confiscated at will, but should order the recipient to send it to the nearest exchange agency to exchange for legal currency. The ignorant people who do not understand the policy and carry silver coins should immediately be instructed to exchange them for legal currency at the nearest exchange agency. Those who carry them to the exchange agency to exchange legal currency should not be intercepted on the way, causing disturbances. If there are deliberate violations, the people should be allowed to accuse them and be severely investigated. If they deliberately conceal, attempt to leak, or collect, transport, and operate for private profit, once detected, they should still be severely punished according to law, in order to combine compassion with the intention of preventing abuse. Sincerely hope you will check it for the sake of He, Finance Ministry Geng Qian Yin."</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Rent Reduction Committee Petitions the Court to Temporarily Suspend the Execution of Rent Arrears Seizure, in Order to Avoid Social Panic Due to the Approaching Year-End Settlement <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, considering that the year-end settlement period is approaching, and that there are many rent dispute cases in this city, petitioned the Jiangsu Local Court and the First and Second Special District Local Courts yesterday, requesting a temporary suspension of execution, stating that if provisional seizures are initiated, it will inevitably cause social panic. The original petition stated: "To the esteemed courts, since the Shanghai Incident, Shanghai has suffered tremendous trauma, coupled with years of drought and floods, turning villages into ruins. The rural economy has collapsed, and the social economy is showing signs of disintegration. Factories and shops have closed down one after another, and unemployed workers are wandering aimlessly. Although some are struggling to survive, many are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, rent arrears lawsuits have arisen. Real estate that was once priced at exorbitant levels is now without buyers. Therefore, to maintain Shanghai's society, the only option is to appeal for rent reduction, which is appropriate in terms of both human sentiment and legal principles. However, people are motivated by self-interest, and landlords who are unaware of the situation are unwilling to voluntarily reduce rent. As a result, tenants are forced to default on rent, leading to dozens of rent lawsuits every day. While the judges of the court enforce the law and handle cases, the execution of provisional seizures is intended to promote the creditors' rights of the property owners. However, as the year-end settlement period is rapidly approaching, most of the industries and businesses in Shanghai are at risk of provisional seizure.

<h3 id="e111">Xu Shiying Discusses Disaster Relief Bonds, Emphasizing Industrial Recovery, with at Least One-Tenth of Funds Used for Seed Costs, Allocation Methods to be Determined Upon Arrival in Nanjing Tomorrow <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Commission, who had previously received a long-distance phone call from Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, summoning him to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang, has completed his official duties and arrived in Shanghai by train the night before last. Yesterday (the 9th), at 6:00 PM, he met with reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency at the Renji Hall and made a statement, saying, "I was summoned to Nanjing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, who instructed that 4 million yuan in disaster relief bonds be jointly issued by the Relief Commission and the National Economic Council, with the approval of the Executive Yuan. The reason for the participation of the Economic Council in these 4 million disaster relief bonds is to emphasize industrial recovery. In addition, at least one-tenth of these 4 million disaster relief bonds will be used for seed costs, including the 160,000 yuan allocated for flood relief. The allocation of the 4 million disaster relief bonds will be determined after my return to Nanjing tomorrow (the 11th). Currently, the bond certificates have not been printed, so preliminary subscription certificates will be issued first to meet immediate needs. Regarding the issue of the Relief Commission's chronic funding shortage, Secretary-General Weng indicated that the Executive Yuan will find ways to subsidize the shortfall, and the hard work of the other committee members over the years will also be rewarded in other ways." According to Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, Xu is scheduled to return to Nanjing by train tomorrow (the 11th) noon, return to Shanghai on the 13th, and convene a meeting of the standing directors of the Flood Relief Association on the 14th to discuss flood relief fundraising matters.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Flood Relief Association Still Owes 180,000 Yuan in Loans from Three Banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications Have Sent Letters of Demand <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The banking industry in this city previously lent 400,000 yuan to the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces for emergency relief, of which the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications lent a total of 300,000 yuan. According to banking industry sources yesterday, as of December 15th of last year, the Relief Association had only repaid 120,000 yuan in principal, with a remaining principal and interest of 183,733 yuan.

<h3 id="e113">The Chamber of Commerce Instructs on the Doubtful Points of Sticking Stamps on Receipts and Bills of Lading <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter in reply to the China Express Transportation Company, instructing that receipts and bills of lading should be stamped separately, stating: "In reply to your letter of the 8th of this month, stating that the temporary receipt issued by your company to the consignor is a temporary substitute for the bill of lading and does not seem to require stamping in accordance with the law, and requesting a letter to the Tianjin Local Court for interpretation and assistance, etc., we have found that the receipt of goods is listed in Article 16, Section 2 of the Stamp Tax Law, which is a voucher issued by the consignee to the consignor, and the bill of lading issued by the forwarding company is listed in Article 16, Section 13 of the Stamp Tax Law, which is a voucher issued by the consignor to the carrier for the extraction of goods. Their nature is different, their tax rates are different, and their effects are different. Your letter states that it is a temporary substitute for the bill of lading, and you want to invoke the temporary substitute note in Section 14 of the same article to exempt it from stamping. However, there are four prerequisites: 1. The temporary note for insurance, if it has the effect of compensation, can be used as a substitute for the insurance policy. Can this temporary goods receipt be used to extract goods and have the effect of a temporary substitute for the bill of lading? However, the receipt states that it is limited to five days to exchange for the bill of lading, and it will be invalid after the expiration date. Therefore, this receipt does not seem to be able to be used to extract goods and serve as a substitute for the bill of lading, and the so-called temporary substitute for the bill of lading in your letter also seems to be unfounded. 2. Since it is called a temporary goods receipt, does your company also have a so-called formal goods receipt, or is the so-called formal goods receipt the bill of lading? This level should also be clearly analyzed. If there is a formal goods receipt, please show us a sample. 3. If this temporary goods receipt can indeed replace the bill of lading for extracting goods, it is the same voucher as mentioned in Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law and has two or more properties. However, because the tax rate for goods receipts is higher, it should still be stamped according to the tax rate for goods receipts. 4. If this temporary receipt cannot be used to extract goods, and the so-called formal receipt is the bill of lading, then our association believes that the receipt is one matter and the bill of lading is another, and they should be stamped separately."</p>

<p>Factories are densely packed in this city. In addition to assisting the fire department and the public security bureau in dealing with factory water disasters, the Social Bureau has also found that a considerable number of workers suffer injuries or various occupational diseases while working in factories. This matter is of great importance to workers' health and industrial economy. While many factories report the above situations to the Social Bureau in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law, most still conceal them, making investigation difficult. In view of this, the bureau has specially formulated investigation forms to contact major hospitals in the city, requesting that when workers come to the hospital for treatment of injuries or illnesses, they fill in the details of the injury and illness according to the form and report them daily for statistical purposes, so as to collect materials and properly plan preventive measures. It is heard that the bureau has been working on this matter since last year, and the Factory Inspection Division of the bureau, together with the Municipal Health Bureau, has scheduled a meeting with representatives of various hospitals at the Youth League at 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 10th) to discuss detailed methods.

<h3 id="e117">Japanese Residents Around Wusong are Changing to Use Japanese Gold as the Standard for Ordering Prices, This Method Was Initiated by the Industrial Association, Said to be Aimed at Avoiding Exchange Rate Losses <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the use of Japanese currency by Japanese residents in Shanghai, the Xin Sheng News Agency has learned that it was initiated by the Industrial Association established by Japanese residents in Shanghai. The head of the Industrial Association is Makise, the owner of the Tamaya Kimono Store. The method is to uniformly convert the prices of Japanese goods imported into our country into Japanese gold standards for sale. In the past, the sale of Japanese goods in Shanghai was based on the actual value of our currency. The reason given is that it can avoid exchange rate losses. However, according to Izumi Ichinin, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, ​​the Industrial Association submitted an application to the Japanese Consulate for approval, but the consulate did not agree. Although some Japanese residents in the Wusong Road area are already using this method, it is believed that it will have no effect and will stop. As for the rumors that a kind of paper money will be issued to replace cash, that is not the case. Currently, the common currency among Japanese merchants is purely Japanese gold, paper money printed by domestic banks, and Chinese legal tender.</p>

<p>Sugar is a major import commodity for our country. In recent years, the domestic chemical industry has gradually developed. The Zhonghua Chemical Industrial Society on Changan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, has hired a German chemical PhD to manufacture glucose syrup (also known as refined sugar). It is completely refined using chemical techniques. The quality is pure and superior, far exceeding imported products, and the price is especially cheap. The reporter believes that the society's products are the pioneer of domestic products, and after more than a year of research, excellent results have been achieved. It is considered an outstanding achievement in the promotion of domestic goods. A visit was made to the factory, and its machinery purchased from Germany is quite sophisticated. It is heard that the society can produce more than 4,000 pounds of glucose per day and 130,000 pounds per month, and is sold exclusively to various confectionery companies in this city as raw materials, which is truly a high-quality domestic product. Because many places outside Shanghai have correspondence orders to promote business, and also operate their own starch factories, business is unusually developed.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, special district rickshaw pullers clashed with the Mutual Aid Society yesterday morning while seeking relief. Over twenty people were injured, and over thirty were arrested. The Rickshaw Pullers Association has petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations and will petition Party and government organs again today. Unemployed rickshaw pullers are venting their anger everywhere, blocking and stopping rickshaws. It is possible that rickshaws may disappear from the Public Concession today. The details, as investigated by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, are as follows:</p>
<p>Clash Erupts</p>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, over five hundred rickshaw puller representatives from the five districts arrived at the entrance of the Mutual Aid Society on Jiaxing Road. Over fifty representatives entered to negotiate with the Director-General, Zhang Dengying. Zhang Dengying happened to be at the meeting handling affairs when a conflict suddenly erupted with other members of the crowd. According to the rickshaw pullers, "We came to the society to request the following:  With the New Year approaching, leaseholders in previous years were able to borrow New Year's expenses. This year, due to market conditions, we were unable to borrow. We heard that the Mutual Aid Society had small loans available, so we came to request a loan.  Due to the poor harvest year, we requested a three-month exemption from Mutual Aid Society fees.  We wanted to borrow the auditorium to commemorate Yang Baoshan, but not only were we refused, but we were also violently beaten." However, according to the Mutual Aid Society, the rickshaw pullers, without regard for right or wrong, immediately started hitting people.</p>
<p>Notice on the Wall</p>
<p>At the same time, a notice was posted on the wall of the Mutual Aid Society's office, which read: "Workers, our business is bad, the New Year is approaching, and expenses are high. We asked the boss to borrow money, but he refused. Therefore, today we will borrow New Year's expenses from the Mutual Aid Society. If they don't agree, we will only not pay the society fees for three months as genuine relief. If the goal is not achieved, please do not retreat."</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>At 9:30, the Jiaxing Road police station received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to protect the area around the Mutual Aid Society, closed the iron gate of the Mutual Aid Society, and took the Director-General, Deputy Director-General, and rickshaw puller representative Dai Rugui, and others, to inquire about the truth, and ordered each to be bandaged. Zhang Dengying and Chen Chunbao were then sent to Bazilu Sanatorium for treatment. At that time, other rickshaw pullers also followed and demanded to be detained as well. The police, due to the large number of people, also closed the iron gate and prohibited rickshaw pullers from entering.</p>
<p>Dispersing Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>At 9:45, the Central Police Station received a report and, fearing an accident, dispatched two special police vehicles to disperse the rickshaw pullers and sent over twenty special detectives to maintain order on the scene. However, the rickshaw pullers scattered and reassembled. Except for the staff, only those authorized by the Mutual Aid Society were allowed to leave and not enter. The situation was serious. Both sides remained deadlocked until 7:00 PM, when the Rickshaw Pullers Association sent representatives to persuade them to disperse. The temporary alert was also lifted.</p>
<p>Separate Petitions</p>
<p>At 10:00 yesterday morning, the Rickshaw Pullers Association sent representative Cang Gongwen to the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Public Concession to petition, requesting:  Negotiations with the Public Works Department to release the arrested rickshaw pullers.  Investigate Zhang Dengying.  Hand over the criminals. The secretary, Tao Leqin, received them and replied that a formal petition was required for the chairman's consideration. At 11:00, Zhu Fengxiang petitioned Yu Qiaqing, making the same requests. Yu agreed to handle it according to the law. At 2:00 PM, Zhou Weigao petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Secretary Yan Esheng received them, agreeing to handle it fairly and advised the rickshaw pullers to disperse to avoid further escalation. At the same time, petitions were also made to the First Special District Citizens' Federation and the Nantong Fellow-Countrymen Association, etc.</p>
<p>Arrested Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>The arrested rickshaw pullers include Xu Qingzi, Xing Hongxi, Xing Hongyi, Dai Rugui, Zhu Xitong, Lu Deguang, Chen Shuangquan, Cang Gongsen, Luan Zhaozhao, Bao Deguang, Xu Fuchang, Ji Decai, Qi Zhenqing, Jiang Jinlin, Li Fahou, Yuan San, Xue Yuquan, Wang Yiren, Ma Taizhi, Ji Songgao, Feng Guisheng, Shu Huaquan, Han Rumu, Han Rugen, Ma Guibin, Li Yourong, Li Youfu, Li Hanjun, Li Dekun, Chen Guangbo, and others, totaling over thirty people. According to police sources, twenty-three of them are considered active members and will be transferred to the court for interrogation after instructions are received. Those with less serious involvement will be released today.</p>
<p>Suspension of Rickshaw Rentals</p>
<p>According to the head of the rickshaw owners, the Rickshaw Committee has decided to start changing licenses on January 15th. The investigation has been particularly strict recently. Rickshaw pullers who have not registered will be fined one dollar and fifty cents, and their vehicles will be detained. Those without armbands will be fined fifty cents, and those without photos will be fined fifty cents. After a part of the rickshaw pullers had the conflict with the Mutual Aid Society today, the majority of renters, owners, and pullers suspended the rental and pulling of rickshaws. It is estimated that 70% of the Shanghai South District, 60% of the Shanghai East District, 20% of the Shanghai West District, 20% of the Shanghai North District, and 20% of the Shanghai Central District did not rent out rickshaws.</p>
<p>Investigation of Injuries</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency conducted a special investigation and found that the following rickshaw pullers were injured: Dai Rugui (head), Lu Deguang (head), Bao Degao (waist), Ji Decai (arm), Cang Gongsen (head), Qi Zhengqing (chest), Zhu Xitong (head), Xing Hongxi (waist), Xing Hongyi (chest), Chen Shuangquan (head), Luan Zhenzhao (head), Xu Fuchang (chest), Jiang Jinlin (back), Li Fahou (head), Zhu Richang (internal injuries), Jiang Chenglong (face), Li Hongjun (head), Chen Yicai (waist), Yuan San (face), Xue Yuquan (head), Wang Yiren (waist), Ma Taizhi (head), Ji Songgao (head), Feng Guisheng (head), and Han Ruben (head). On the Mutual Aid Society side, Zhang Dengying (Director-General) was injured in the chest and head, Chen Chunbao (Deputy Director-General) was injured in the head, Hu Kangning (waist), Gu Bufan (chest), Zheng Yanbin (head), and Zhou Pengnian (a worker) was injured in the head.</p>
<p>Blocking</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM, over five hundred unemployed rickshaw pullers, to oppose the Mutual Aid Society and support the petitioning rickshaw pullers, gathered in the South City and decided to split up and block rickshaws. By 7:30, many rickshaws in the Public Concession were being deflated and stopped by these unemployed rickshaw pullers along the way. Rickshaw merchants, renters, and pullers, unable to bear the losses, decided to suspend all rentals and pulling from today until the dispute is resolved.</p>
<p>Petition Goals</p>
<p>Because the Rickshaw Pullers Association in the Special District’s application for registration of unemployed rickshaw pullers was unsuccessful, and the rickshaw pullers deflated tires and blocked member's rickshaws, it was decided that the representatives from the five districts of Southeast, Northwest, and Central would gather at 8:00 AM this morning and petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs on a large scale. Their goals are: (1) To negotiate with the Concession for the long-term registration of rickshaw pullers; (2) To negotiate for the Mutual Aid Society to be run by the rickshaw pullers themselves; (3) To provide relief to rickshaw pullers; (4) To ensure that similar situations do not occur in the future.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society Report</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Headquarters, at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month, over two hundred rickshaw pullers came to the society's tea room, claiming that the renters in the South City were not releasing vehicles and their livelihoods were not secure and requested for relief (a written note was posted in various parts of the association, and a copy is attached). At that time, the society's staff, Wang Boyin, Zhang Xiaojiang, etc., responded to them. While they were talking, Cang Gongsen, Li Yourong, Li Youfu, and others led over eighty rickshaw pullers from the Rickshaw Pullers Association, pretending to be coming to the meeting for tea. After they had securely guarded all the doors of the office, Cang Gongsen closed the main gate of the association facing Dixwell Road and guarded it himself. At the same time, over ten rickshaw pullers jumped over the inquiry counter and shouted to hit. When they swarmed into the office, the society's staff, Gu Bufan, Wang Boyin, Hu Kangning, etc., stepped forward to stop them and were all beaten. Other rickshaw pullers who only listened to one side swarmed into the meeting room. At that time, the staff of the education department, etc., tried hard to pull the door closed, but because they were not strong enough, the rickshaw pullers broke the window and burst in, and joined the rickshaw pullers who had rushed in from the office, and swarmed into the Director-General's office (there was a tall rickshaw puller guarding the telephone, his porcelain license number was 28202, and he had a yellow earring on his left ear), dragged the Director-General (Zhang Dengying) to the meeting room, pushed him down and beat him indiscriminately. Deputy Director-General (Chen Chunbao) stepped forward to dissuade them and was also dragged in and beaten. Some grabbed the supplies in the meeting room to use as weapons. At this time, the society's worker Zhou Pengnian bravely stepped forward and shielded Director-General Zhang with his body and was beaten for over ten minutes. The society's staff witnessed some of the rickshaw pullers who did it deliberately hit their faces and hands, etc. At this time, two policemen arrived. The staff of the society then called the police station to request for additional policemen, but could not do so. When Director-General Zhang and Deputy Director-General Chen saw the policemen arrived, they shouted for help. Deputy Director-General Chen even shouted loudly to the policeman next to him, "Policeman, please try to stop them!" Although there were two policemen at this time, Director-General Zhang and Chen were still being beaten. The staff of the society could not do anything because the telephone lines were not working and the front and back gates were guarded. About ten minutes later, one Western policeman and two Chinese policemen arrived and started to disperse some of the rickshaw pullers. The arsonists who beat Director-General Zhang and Chen were still extremely arrogant. Knowing that they could not escape, they claimed that they had to reason with the police station and twisted the two Director-Generals together and, under the suppression of the Chinese and Western policemen, led them to the police station. There were also some rickshaw pullers who had not yet committed the acts and then laid ambush in the various departments of the association, and for some reason, beat each other again. At this time, several Chinese, Western, and Indian policemen successively escorted the arsonist rickshaw pullers to the police station. However, many rickshaw pullers surrounding the outside of the association had tried to rush into the gate several times and were stopped by the Chinese and Western policemen left behind. At around 10:00, Wang Zhiren, a member of the Rickshaw Committee, first came to the association to investigate and, while getting into the car, was surrounded by the rickshaw pullers standing outside the association gate, preventing the car from leaving. The police dispersed them and arrested the ringleader. The injuries of Director-General Zhang and Deputy Director-General Chen still need to be examined by the hospital. However, Zhou Pengnian, a worker of the association, has been sent to Renji Hospital for examination and emergency treatment due to his serious injuries. The staff of the association with minor injuries have been treated separately by the association's clinic (Gu Bufan injured his hand and bled a lot). Up to noon on the twelfth, there were still many people in short clothes gathered around the association and did not disperse. The association had received a secret report yesterday morning, and Director-General Zhang of the association specially notified the police station by telephone, and soon after this serious and unfortunate incident occurred. The departments and items destroyed and damaged by the association have been surveyed and registered by the police several times. In order to clarify the facts, the association has attached a list of the rickshaw pullers' disturbances and losses to the rear. The original text of the rickshaw pullers' notice posted by the arsonists (already seen above, omitted). An overview of the destroyed departments of the association: Inquiry office: Eleven teapots were smashed, and more than twenty teacups were smashed. One pair of Deputy Director-General Chen's glasses were smashed, and his shoe covers were lost. Statistics room: The writing desk was overturned, the display windows were broken, books were trampled and torn, many office supplies were destroyed, and one yellow woolen hat was lost. Meeting room (兼 Education Department): The stove was knocked over, the chimney was trampled, the doors and windows were broken, many of the books distributed at the beginning of the semester were trampled and torn, the spittoon was broken, and many office supplies were destroyed. Intellectual Education Department: The net basket was trampled, books were trampled and torn, the display windows were broken, and many office supplies were destroyed.</p>

<p>Yu Mingfeng, a native of Shaoxing, 42 years old, owner of the Xingchang Rickshaw Company at No. 222 East, Lujiabang, Zhengning Road, South City, was robbed at 2:40 yesterday morning by four robbers. They had a cleaver and a fake pistol. They were wearing gray cloth shirts and black pants, and blue cloth shirts and black cloth pants. They all spoke with a Nantongzhou accent. They had previously pulled rickshaws and were now unemployed. When the four robbers broke in, two were stationed outside to guard, and then the rickshaw pullers of the company were monitored. Six yuan in silver dollars, eight jiao in small silver dollars, and twelve thousand copper coins were robbed, and they fled west. The victim followed them to the vicinity of the bridge on Chezhan Road, Lujiabang Road, and saw a policeman on duty, and shouted for help to catch the thieves. A thief named Mao Jinf, a native of Tongzhou, 38 years old, was immediately intercepted and taken to the Sanguantang Police Station. Since the crime was committed in the jurisdiction of the Wenmiao Road Police Station, the thief was transferred to that station, where he confessed that his accomplices were Chen Yuanqing and Chen Hongqing, who lived at No. 715 Beinong, Xianmianci. Detectives were dispatched to arrest them, but they were not found. The thief was reported to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Liu Zirong, the third young son of Liu Huizhi, the former general manager of the China Industrial Bank, married Liu Xi, the daughter of Xi Exian, a Jiangyin dye merchant (also known as Xi Yunqing and Yunqing). The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, but because Liu Zirong spent less time at home, Xi Yunqing was lonely in her boudoir, which led to her being seduced by the hired chauffeur, Wu Wenxiang, and they eloped together. They hid in the kiosk at No. 84 Jixiangfang, Wujianong, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession. Liu Zirong found out, called the police, and went to the address to arrest them. Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang were arrested and transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the Procuratorate of the District Court. After the prosecutor Tang Ruxiu's investigation was completed, Liu Xi and others were prosecuted for adultery, based on their repeated admissions at the Public Security Bureau. Judge Shao Qinzhi held a public trial that was not concluded, and the two defendants were sent back for further trial. At the same time, the lawyers of both parties were instructed to conduct reconciliation outside the court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The District Court held a trial at 2:00 PM yesterday. At 1:00 PM, the gallery on the second floor was already full.</p>
<p>Early Warning of Full Seats</p>
<p>Those who arrived later still came in droves, but there were no seats available. They all stood on tiptoe. Judicial Sheriff Zhang Shuping was deeply concerned that too many people in the gallery would disrupt court order, so he supervised four bailiffs to take care of the court. At 2:30, Judge Shao took the bench and first heard trivial cases. Seeing the unusually crowded gallery, he ordered that the chauffeur's adultery case be heard in the first courtroom (the first and second courtrooms were the largest, with a very large area, and the gallery could accommodate hundreds of people). The audience listened to the order and crowded into the first courtroom.</p>
<p>Compete With Each Other</p>
<p>The order was slightly chaotic, but Chief Judge Pang Shurong was hearing a land appeal case in the first courtroom. It was already 3:30 when Chief Judge Pang finished the trial and left the court. Judge Shao and the clerk of court then came to the court and took the bench. The audience's spirits were lifted. The three lawyers, Chao Kun, Tu Kunfan, and Gu, hired by the first defendant, Liu Xi, and the lawyer Tong Banggan, hired by the second defendant, Wu Wenxiang, arrived in court one after another. Judge Shao ordered Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang to be brought to the case and first ordered them to sit temporarily on the side benches. Liu Xi's</p>
<p>Pale Complexion</p>
<p>She looked around, not as red-faced and extremely shy as she was during the last court hearing. Wu Wenxiang, on the other hand, was gaunt, frowning, and silently lowering his head, as if he regretted it. The judge asked whether Liu Zirong's lawyers were present and to what extent the case had been reconciled outside the court. Lawyer Gu replied that his lawyer had repeatedly met with Shan Yuhua, the lawyer commissioned by Liu Zirong, and had some clues. He was asked about the</p>
<p>Terms of the Question, Answer: There are no special conditions. Today, his lawyer received a phone call from the family of Lawyer Shan, saying that Lawyer Shan had gone to Zhenjiang beforehand and had not yet returned to Shanghai. It was uncertain whether he could arrive in court today. He asked the court to change the date of the joint trial because there was a possibility of reconciliation outside the court. Then Lawyer Dong stood up and said that the defendant Wu Wenxiang in this case requested the judge to allow him to be released on bail. Then Lawyer Tu Kunfan stood up and said that the divorce case of the first defendant, Liu Xi, had been ordered by the First Special Court to expedite the reconciliation between the two parties by inviting relatives and friends within one month.</p>
<p>Conduct Reconciliation</p>
<p>However, personal lawsuits must be based on the wishes of both parties. The defendant is currently detained in your court, and all reconciliation proceedings are very difficult. Moreover, the defendant has been married to Liu Zirong for many years and has a son. If the couple remembers their past feelings, they will be closer to reconciliation. He asked the judge to allow him to be released on bail. The questioner said that the first defendant, Liu Xi, had previously submitted a statement requesting bail. Her</p>
<p>Reasons for Bail</p>
<p>It was claimed that she was ill. After a forensic examination by the court, Liu Xi was not ill. Therefore, the issue of bail will be determined when the case is concluded. He also ordered that since the defendant's lawyer had requested a change of date today, and Liu Zirong and the witnesses summoned by the court had not reported, he would be allowed to reschedule the trial. Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang were returned to custody, and the court was adjourned.</p>

<p>Yang Bangji, a native of Yancheng, 36 years old, lives at No. 63, Lane 625, Mett Hess Road. He used to make a living by renting out rickshaws. At around 7:40 yesterday afternoon, Yang, his friend Lu Zhenmin, a native of Yancheng, 30 years old, and five members of his family were having dinner together when five men suddenly came outside the door, speaking with a Jiangbei accent. They broke into the inner room and, without asking why, each took out a pistol and fired four or five shots at Yang and Lu. At that time, Yang and Lu were having dinner and could not dodge in time. They were hit and fell to the ground with blood gushing out. When the murderers saw that their purpose had been achieved, they shouted and fled. When Yang's family called for help, the nearby police rushed to the scene, but the murderers had already escaped. They immediately telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station, first sent a car to take the two to the hospital for treatment, and then went out to hunt down the murderers. Yang was shot in the left abdomen, injuring the large intestine. Lu was shot in the neck and left foot. All were serious injuries, so the situation was very critical. As for who the murderers were, the victims were not conscious and did not make a clear statement, only vaguely answering that some of the murderers were rickshaw pullers and some were relatives, fearing that it was due to an unsuccessful loan. The police are currently investigating.</p>

<p>Xiang Yixing, a native of Ningbo, 50 years old, the owner of the Xingchang Iron Factory at No. 150 O'Car Road, is quite wealthy and a devout Buddhist. He has a family temple on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, where he often goes to recite scriptures and practice Taoism. On July 20th last year, Xiang was kidnapped and a large sum of money was extorted. He escaped danger on August 18th and stayed at home, spending his days in leisure. Unexpectedly, between October 13th and January 6th this year, there were other bandits coveting him and sent ten threatening letters one after another. At first, they demanded 80,000 yuan, then reduced it to a minimum of 20,000 yuan, and arranged for someone to bring the money to meet them near the telegraph pole at No. 141 Dongjiadu, Pudong. Otherwise, they would take drastic measures. Xiang was so troubled by these people that he took the letter to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and went to the agreed location to observe the situation, but no one came to talk. At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Office, Detective Liu Shaokui, and Detectives Chen Yonggui, Qian Xianzhang, Xie Futang, etc., arrested Wei Youliang (also known as A San), a native of Chongming, Wang Jinzhang, Zhang Guangen, and Xi A Gen (also known as Changjiao A Gen), natives of Pudong, at Room 16, Jiaotong Hotel, No. 37, Lane 117, Shandong Road, and transferred them to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhu, detailed the previous situation and claimed that the last two letters were named by Zhang Desheng and Xu Jinbiao, requesting an adjournment of the case. He then submitted the threatening letters for inspection. According to the victim Xiang Yixing's statement, he was rescued by detectives from the Public Security Bureau. He did not give ransom money to the kidnappers. The only thing the defendants said was that Wei Youliang used to see him playing in the temple. When the four defendants were questioned, they confessed that the escaped leader, someone A, had initiated the idea. They admitted that they had written the last two threatening letters, but they did not know the rest. The rest of the confessions were vague. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered them to be returned to custody and the case to be verified at a later date.</p>

<p>Zhang Ronghua, a native of Xiuning, Anhui, 55 years old, owns the Runyuan Used Clothing Store at No. 427 Minquan Road in the French Concession and has a Runcheng branch store in Kunming. He married a local woman, Zhou (40 years old this year), early in his life and lived in Sanxingli No. 93, Dapu Road, South City, in the Chinese Concession. Zhang's son from his mistress, Gui Lin, is 27 years old this year and married into the family of his fellow villager Zha Jiren as his son-in-law. Gui Lin and his father-in-law run the Dingtai Clothing Store on Lanmidu, Pudong. Zhang Ronghua owns two stores. Due to the poor market situation recently, business has been slow, resulting in huge debt losses. In October last year, his son Gui Lin transferred 300 yuan in cash and more than 200 yuan in goods, repeatedly demanding payment. Unexpectedly, Gui Lin not only refused to return them, but also colluded with hooligans to make things difficult for his father. Zhang Ronghua learned that his hatred was difficult to vent and that the year-end business summary period for merchants was approaching and could not be compensated. For these reasons, he had a negative thought. On the night of the 7th, he slept in the store and secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. At 10:30 the next morning, Zhang's second son, Guan Mao (17 years old, studying in the store), saw that his father had not yet gotten up and went into the room to call him, but there was no response. He then discovered that he had committed suicide by poisoning. There was a box of raw opium left over next to his pillow, with a small amount of opium and two suicide notes inside, describing how he was bullied by his son and owed debts. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but the poisoning was too deep and the treatment was ineffective. He died at 1:30 in the afternoon. The hospital reported it to the French Police Station, and detectives were sent to investigate the cause of death. The body was sent to the Tongren Garden Yuenfengtang morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court and forensic clerks arrived at the morgue and confirmed that the deceased, Zhang Ronghua, had committed suicide by poisoning before his death. After questioning the deceased's wife, Zhang Zhou, and second son, Zhang Guanmao, they were ordered to sign an undertaking to claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>The king of flower gambling, Hai Laochong, also known as Ding Haiquan, age 42, from Ningbo, residing at No. 2 Chengji Lane, Fuyou Road, was the head of the biggest gambling operation in the city during its heyday. He had followers like Xiao Tanhe (i.e., Xu Hexing) as his accomplices, and they were quite prominent. After the official crackdown, they went into hiding. Recently, Ding and his gang resumed their old business, secretly collecting gambling money for flower gambling at home. Ignorant and foolish people flocked to them. At 9:40 PM the night before last, the Yimiao Police Station, acting on a tip, dispatched household registration officer Chen Shusheng, disguised with police officers, to investigate and make arrests. They found three flower gambling slips in Hai Laochong's room and discovered opium residue in the parlor, indicating that Ding's follower, Xiao Tanhe, was privately smoking opium without registration, while working. Suddenly, a person rushed in from outside the door, looking flustered. When questioned about their late-night visit, they claimed to be there to collect blank paper slips. When asked what they were for, they changed their story to collecting debts. A search of their person revealed a pencil and blank paper for writing flower gambling slips. They were immediately arrested along with the evidence and sent to the bureau for legal processing.</p>

<p>Thirty Thousand Gold Recovered from Major Fraud Case, Judge's Plea for Disaster Victims Proves Fruitless</p>
<p>Zhu Shien (also known as Junmu, Zhanfu), a wealthy real estate merchant residing at No. 25 Anren Street, Nanshi, owns assets worth several million yuan. His eldest son, Zhu Yinting (also known as Zhihuai), is a student at Yinghua Shuguan, but is dull-witted. So, even at the age of seventeen, he is still in the lowest grade. Recently, Zhu Yinting considered engaging in gold speculation to increase his assets. As a result, he was deceived by Gu Peiyuan (also known as Naiping), a native of Pudong and owner of the Yuanji Driving School at No. 44 Guangdong Road, through methods of face reading, seeking divine guidance, and engaging in speculation, to the tune of a huge sum of 45,115 yuan. Subsequently, Zhu Zhanfu reported the matter to the General Police Station, which arrested Gu and handed him over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special District Court, opened Criminal Court One to continue the interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment period, the defendant led police personnel to various banks to withdraw the embezzled funds, totaling 29,530.65 yuan, plus interest of 15.06 yuan. The funds are currently being held by the police. Zhu Yinting's enrollment at Yinghua Shuguan was on February 7th of last year, under the name Zhu Zhihuai, with an age of sixteen, etc. Gu Peiyuan completely acknowledged the facts. However, he stated that while the case was his own fault, it was also caused by the plaintiff. The court, having understood the facts, instructed the defense to argue. Lawyers Du Jimei and Xi Shichang, based on the fact that the defendant had no prior criminal record, requested a reduced sentence or probation to give him a chance to reform. Judge Qian then summoned Zhu Zhanfu to the court, informing him that most of the embezzled funds had been recovered, totaling 30,000 yuan. If these funds could not be recovered, there would be nothing he could do. Moreover, the entire matter was caused by his son's folly. Given the current widespread natural and man-made disasters, with disaster victims starving and freezing everywhere, he could consider donating a portion of the recovered funds to disaster relief organizations. This would both save the disaster victims from their plight and create good fortune for himself. He asked for his opinion. However, Zhu Zhanfu valued money as his life. Despite the court's repeated pleas for the sake of the disaster victims, he refused to give a single hair. His lack of benevolence as a wealthy man was extreme. Seeing Zhu's stubborn attitude, the court realized that further persuasion would be ineffective and declared the session adjourned, scheduling the sentencing for Wednesday of next week. As the plaintiff did not file an ancillary civil suit, the embezzled funds should be temporarily retained by the police.</p>

<p>Father Takes Son's Concubine, Causes Her to Leave, Promises Money But Fails to Fulfill</p>
<p>Guo Futting, a wealthy businessman from Chaozhou residing at No. 4 Fu'an Lane, South Chengdu Road, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Guo Yu, the concubine of his eldest son, Yucai, for failure to fulfill an agreed-upon debt. The grounds for the lawsuit are as follows: Guo Futting previously took Chen Lianxiang as his concubine. Chen gave birth to a son named Guan Hong in June of the 23rd year. On July 3rd of the same year, the defendant and Chen signed a contract, allocating real estate worth 200,000 yuan to Chen, with 150,000 yuan as Guan Hong's inheritance and 50,000 yuan as Chen's alimony. Subsequently, the plaintiff's aunt suspected that Chen's union with the defendant was based on the plaintiff's relationship, so she forced Yucai to separate from the plaintiff. The defendant, feeling that the plaintiff had taken the blame for him, made another agreement, allocating one-third of Chen's 50,000 yuan share to the plaintiff. However, recently the defendant regretted this and so the plaintiff filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff 16,700 yuan, plus interest. The case was heard yesterday afternoon in Civil Court Thirteen of the First Special District Court by Judge Wang Daxi. The defendant, Guo Futting, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appear in court and argue that Yu was the third concubine of the defendant's son, Yucai. Yucai had long been independent, and the defendant had no obligation to support the plaintiff. At the time, because Yu was living with the defendant's concubine, Chen, the defendant entrusted Yu to take care of Chen and gave her one-third of the living expenses paid to Chen as compensation. However, later, the defendant severed relations with Chen, so Chen's living expenses were also canceled, and the plaintiff's one-third compensation also ceased to exist. The contract was also taken back and destroyed. Chen's 50,000 yuan matter was a completely separate issue. Therefore, the plaintiff's request is completely unfounded and should be dismissed. Judge Wang, after reviewing the case, determined that further investigation was necessary and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Three Previous Lawsuits Failed</p>
<p>Zhu Liqing, a young woman from Nanjing, was hired by Le Zhenbao, the owner of the Taichang Woodware Store on Nanjing Road, in 1930, to be a private English tutor for his grandson. Le Songxiong, Le's son, who was nearing thirty, admired Zhu's talent and intellect. In the spring of the following year, he invited her to tour the scenic West Lake, where he drugged her at a hotel and had relations with her. After returning to Shanghai, they cohabited on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession and had two daughters, Zhi'er and Ren'er. By the autumn of the year before last, their love had suddenly broken down. Le then filed a lawsuit in court, seeking a judgment confirming that he had no family relationship with Zhu Liqing. However, after three trials, Le lost each time. Subsequently, Zhu Liqing also filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering Le Songxiong to pay 12,000 yuan in alimony. In January of last year, the court ordered Le Songxiong to pay Zhu Liqing 6,000 yuan in alimony, with a provisional execution order requiring Le to pay 60 yuan per month for living expenses during the appeal period. Le then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, seeking a judgment ordering the defendant, Zhu Liqing, to sever family ties and return the two daughters. After reviewing the case, the court ruled that the defendant, Zhu Liqing, resided at No. 18 Zhiqin Fang, Rue Mgr. F. X. Zhao, in the French Concession, and that the court lacked jurisdiction and ordered the case to be transferred to the Second Special District Court for trial. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Tu Shenjie of the Second Special District Court heard the case in Court Six. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer, and the defendant, Zhu Liqing, appeared in court with a lawyer. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the facts of the case and the purpose of the request. The defendant firmly opposed the plaintiff's two requests, stating that the court had already ruled that she should receive monthly living expenses and that she did not want to sever family ties. As for the two children, they were still young, and it had been agreed that she would raise them and did not want to return them. After the lawyers for both sides debated, the court adjourned the hearing and scheduled the sentencing for the 14th.</p>

<p>Family's Livelihood Threatened, Right to File Ancillary Civil Suit Reserved</p>
<p>Xie Xisheng, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 295 Rue Galieni in the French Concession, was walking near the intersection of Xizang Road and Race Course Road at around 10:00 AM on the 9th of last month when the Yongchang Construction Company at No. 31 Longmen Road was constructing a building. Due to the negligence of the workers, a giant timber fell from the third floor, striking Xie, knocking him to the ground. His head, fingers, and left leg were injured, and he fell unconscious. A police officer arrived and sent Xie to Renji Hospital for treatment. The diagnosis revealed that his left leg bone was broken, and it was treated with a plaster cast. According to the doctor, it would take one to two years to recover. Xie's family relied entirely on his income to make a living. Due to the injury, his family's livelihood was threatened. Therefore, he hired lawyer Jia Yaoxi to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Zhou Gongshan, the owner of the Yongchang Construction Company, for negligent injury, and reserved the right to file an ancillary civil suit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Wanchang heard the case in Criminal Court Nine. Xie Xisheng was carried to the court and described the incident. Zhou Gongshan argued that he was a "general contractor" and that the project was contracted to another party, so he was not responsible. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the issue of "general contractor" and "subcontractor" was an internal matter for the defendant and could not be used as a reason to evade responsibility. The court determined that further investigation was necessary and adjourned the hearing. The defendant, Zhou Gongshan, was released on bail of 500 yuan to await further summons.</p>

<p>Wan Xuelai Di Mietuoyier, a White Russian residing at No. 37, Lane 141, Haig Road, slightly intoxicated, carrying an iron hammer (commonly known as a "langtou"), went to the entrance of the Soviet Russian Consulate at No. 20 Bund Road at 2:50 PM yesterday. He used the hammer to break the thick glass window of the consulate and destroy the Soviet Russian emblem nailed to the door. As he continued to cause damage, a Chinese police officer, No. 2867, from the Hongkou Police Station, happened to pass by and arrested Wan. He was taken back to the police station along with the hammer and the damaged emblem glass. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court Five of the First Special District Court for interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng. Police lawyers Ru Bao Yi and Qian Xun Jiu presented the case, stating that Wan's actions contained political implications and were being investigated. They requested temporary detention for one week. The Chinese police officer then testified about the circumstances at the time. When questioned, Wan admitted that he had drunk alcohol yesterday but was not drunk. He directly admitted to destroying the Soviet Russian emblem and the consulate window, but when the court asked about his motives, he only replied that he was "unable to answer." The Soviet Russian consulate also commissioned a lawyer to appear in court and file an ancillary civil suit. Judge Huang Risheng approved the detention of Wan Xuelai Di Mietuoyier for one week for further interrogation.</p>

<p>City Health Bureau Strictly Investigating</p>
<p>The City Health Bureau previously received a tip that Kuang Buyang, a doctor practicing at No. 446, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, whose real name was Kuang A'lu, a native of Taishan, Guangdong, had worked as a ticket collector at the rooftop garden of the Xin Xin Company on Nanjing Road and at a theater in Nanjing. He then worked in general affairs at a hospital in Nanjing. He then bribed someone with 250 yuan to obtain a graduation diploma from the Shandong Public Medical School and used it to fraudulently obtain a doctor's license from the Ministry of Interior. He later came to Shanghai and used the doctor's license to obtain a business license from the Health Bureau. He practiced medicine on the second floor of No. 987 North Sichuan Road. He has now moved to his current location to practice. It is said that Kuang has not even received elementary school education and has only studied in private schools in his hometown. He has no medical knowledge. To be called a doctor in this situation is to endanger society and the people. It is necessary to strictly ban this to protect the people's lives. After receiving the report, the bureau submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Health Department, which forwarded it to the Shandong Provincial Department of Education to verify that the graduation diploma was indeed forged. It was ordered that Kuang Buyang be strictly investigated according to law, that the original document be confiscated and sent to the department for cancellation. It is reported that the bureau has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to work with the concession police to go to the address and arrest Kuang Buyang and transfer him to the Shanghai District Court for trial in accordance with the law, to serve as a warning to others. At the same time, the original forged graduation diploma and doctor's license have been submitted to the department for cancellation.</p>

<p>The Wayside Public Wharf on Yih Heung Road in the Eastern District was originally made of wood and was built in 1913. It was used for twenty years.

<p>Since its opening last year, the Huahua Silk Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road has attracted customers due to its unparalleled scale in the country and its quality and affordable prices. The store has been crowded every day, causing a sensation in Shanghai and widespread publicity in the newspapers. As a result, the Xishi area of Nanjing Road has seen a thriving scene, and major companies have sprung up one after another, making it a bustling center. It is reported that as the new year of 1936 begins, the Huahua Silk Company is reinvigorating itself and striving to improve itself. In order to further satisfy customers and reciprocate the great patronage of all sectors last year, it will be holding a big sale with a 20% discount starting today. This genuine and major sacrifice includes all goods and is no different from a cash giveaway. This is a new initiative in the silk industry. According to the company, this discounted sale will only last for one week. Because silk is different from other goods, a 20% discount is a significant sacrifice. For example, if you buy 100 yuan worth of goods, you will save 20 yuan. Therefore, it will only last for a few days as a New Year's cash gift to customers.</p>

<p>TASS Moscow, December 18th: The Soviet Union pays special attention to sports training. Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and Baku all have large sports academies with a total of 4,000 students. In addition to studying scientific and natural sciences, students must also study physical education and various sports techniques. In 1934, 415 graduates were sent to various schools and enterprises as sports instructors. Many famous Soviet educators are graduates of the aforementioned schools. The Moscow and Leningrad Sports Academies received the Lenin Medal for their excellent performance.</p>
<p>Twenty cities in the Soviet Union have secondary sports schools, training 5,000 physical education instructors for factories and collective farms.

<h3 id="e165">Two Major Initiatives of the Japanese Media in This Year's Sports World: Using Aircraft to Cover and Deliver News of the Berlin Olympics; Inviting Professional Tennis Players Tilden and Vines to Perform <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The advancement of business depends solely on news, and the advancement of the news business depends solely on speed. The advancement of sports especially lies in on-site observation and technical review. In recent years, the rapid progress of the Japanese sports world has alarmed the world. In this year's Berlin Olympics in August, there is a strong call to seize championships, and the heroic words are enough to show Japan's spirit of hard work in every endeavor, which is enough to alarm our country's authorities. Here are two major sports initiatives of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun in this year to inform the nation.</p>
<p>(1) Special Express Flight On-Site Communication of the Asian Olympics</p>
<p>The mobilization of modern science is a key to the rapid advancement of the news business. Such as aircraft communication, major news agencies around the world have specialized aircraft, it is not surprising. However, this Asian Olympics, is far away in Berlin, Europe, and it is commendable that a single news agency in our Asia has this great act. They have ordered the latest high-speed aircraft in Germany, called the "BFW108B model aircraft" with a speed of 300 kilometers per hour, has an endurance of eight hours. The long distance between Tokyo and Berlin is 11,000 kilometers (7,000 miles), and can be reached in just three days. This aircraft is specially prepared for the 11th Asian Olympics to deliver on-site photographs, records, and books. They all say that this long-distance air flight is still the world's latest business. This is also a record in the world's aviation history to fly day and night over the Siberian wilderness. Pilots "Kumakawa" and "Iitori Mechanic" will go to Germany on the 5th to practice the new aircraft.</p>
<p>(2) Recruiting American Tennis Players Tilden and Vines</p>
<p>Every year, the Japanese sports world invites world-class sports figures to perform in the country, is a major reason for the rapid advancement of their sports skills. Such as the past recruitment of European and American track and field teams, boxing teams, baseball teams, swimming teams, the obvious achievements, is no controversy. Now the Yomiuri Shimbun has announced the recruitment of two great tennis masters in the world, then expect other similar heroic acts, are yet to come in succession.</p>
<p>Tilden, 42 years old, was the United States' 11-year-old Davis Cup representative (since 1920). He continued to maintain the United States' honor in the Davis Cup for seven years. Tilden's unique serve, volley, and chop have completely broken through the European style of defense. His miraculous attack is famous in the world.</p>
<p>Vines, 24 years old, is a new figure in the American tennis world who has risen after Tilden. He dominated the world at the age of 20. Recently, he joined a professional tennis team, and his superb skills are improving, greatly surpassing Tilden, Pan Le (England), Crawford (Australia), Kramm (Germany), and is recognized as the world's No. 1 star.</p>
<p>In the cloud, Tilden and Vines won five world professional tennis titles, and after five fierce demonstration performances, their fierce serves and lightning volleys have become the unique skills of tennis, all asserted that it is the foundation for a major advancement in Japanese tennis, and these two have already telegraphed their acceptance.</p>

<p>The private Zhengshi Middle School in this city has a unique approach to student training, paying particular attention to extracurricular activities. This semester, the preliminary department held a basic science competition (i.e., Chinese, English, and Mathematics). Awards were given in two forms: group and individual. The competition methods differed between Chinese and English/Mathematics. The English/Mathematics assessment process consisted of preliminary and final rounds. The exam questions for each subject were selected by the Assessment Committee from this semester's textbooks, with ten questions chosen. First, a preliminary round was held within each grade and group (the school divides each grade into three or four groups). The group's score was calculated as a percentage of the total possible points. The group with the highest score in the grade received the group award. The top ten performers in each group's preliminary round participated in the grade-wide final round. The top three performers after the final round received individual awards. For the individual competition in Chinese, there was no preliminary round, only a competition held within each grade and group. The top three individual performers received awards. For groups, the top three groups with the highest scores received awards. It has been learned that the final round results showed that many students in each grade achieved perfect scores in English and Mathematics. The committee raised the difficulty of the questions and shortened the time limit, holding another final round to determine the award winners. According to the school's administrator, this type of competition best encourages students' interest in studying. During the competition period, which coincided with nationwide student unrest, the school's students were still working hard, neglecting sleep and meals. This is truly rare. It is said that the school held an awards ceremony on January 6, which inspired all the students.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Maybe the old hen swallowed it; they are all greedy little fellows," she said; Xiao Qiao couldn't help but laugh, which ignited her anger, and she went to hit her brother, startling him. She then burst into tears, running away while shouting, "He's not! He's not! He's not!"</p>
<p>Her aunt and uncle were unwilling to shake the child's trust in her friend, hoping that her innocent feelings might one day prove to be correct, and therefore liked her even more. Later, after this incident passed, Nader often said that if it weren't for Xiao Mei, he simply wouldn't have been able to bear it. While others avoided him, she was unwilling to follow suit, becoming even closer to him than before. When he was comforting himself with his broken piano, she would now sit beside him and listen quietly, her face full of trust and love. At this time, Nader would completely forget his humiliation and feel very happy. She asked him to help her with her schoolwork. In her small kitchen, she cooked all sorts of food, which he would swallow wholeheartedly, no matter what it was, because gratitude could imbue even the worst taste with a fragrant aroma. When she saw that he didn't dare to play with other children, she suggested that they play baseball, team ball, etc. She picked some small flowers from her little garden and placed them on his writing desk—using all sorts of ways to show that she was not a fickle friend, and that no matter what his social status was, she would always be loyal. Nan En soon followed her lead, at least in outward appearance, so as not to embarrass others; she restrained her sharp tongue and prevented her nose, which often showed contempt, from expressing any doubt or displeasure. This was especially difficult for Mrs. Qi Tan (Note), because she firmly believed that Nader must have taken the money.</p>
<p>(Note) Qi Tan is a homophone for "garrulous."</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, rumors that the bond interest rate would be reduced spread, and the selling pressure of No. 48 and other issues continued to surge. No. 4 and No. 11 had bought in extremely large quantities the day before, but yesterday they had reversed to selling. The financial industry's selling was also very considerable. For arbitrage trading, most intended to deliver upon expiration. The rumor of interest rate reduction was not without reason. If the market price discount is taken as a ratio, then the decline is still on the rise. The virtual weakness of the table is undeniable. Throughout the day, it was almost still in a state of declining in each round. Although the attitude was slightly firmer in the middle, it was still unable to stand firm. There is no great optimism for the future. When the market opened yesterday morning, demobilization fell sharply by six and a half jiao, and the situation deteriorated. The decline was gradually rising and becoming more severe. The regular six fell by nearly one yuan. The selling pressure of Nos. 15, 17, and 48 and other issues was still strong, while Nos. 4 and 11 were temporarily suspended. In the second round, Nos. 16, 33, and 35 and other issues were sold in large quantities, and the market continued to weaken, falling another one jiao to half a yuan or so. When the market opened in the afternoon, the selling pressure eased slightly, and retail investors made up for their positions, rebounding slightly by three or four jiao. After entering, the regular six was sold by No. 54 and fell by six jiao. It seems that there is a hopeless trend. The closing price then returned to virtual weakness, with small declines of two or three jiao. The 20-volume issue also fell by as much as six jiao. The future is still sold thinly, and the rise is unable to boost the situation. As a result, the market prices uniformly continued to fall by several jiao to 1.3 yuan. The coded legacy for this month was only a small 2.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was 23,925,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left.

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation turned to the downstream. Because the overseas cotton industry is still in a sluggish state, sentiment is depressed. In addition, the yarn in storage exceeds 20,000 bales, so the pressure from sellers is particularly heavy. However, the bulls in the financial industry have not yet emerged, but the intention of the industry is to tend to dumping.</p>
<p>Gengfeng's Bull Settlement</p>
<p>In the front market of standard yarn, due to the sharp fall in American cotton, it has turned into a calm situation. The recent rise in three-grade yarn has stabilized the market sentiment again. Changfeng purchased in large quantities, and the first round rose by 7.8 jiao. There was not much change in the second and third rounds. As a result, each month rose by 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market was still sustainable when it opened in the afternoon, and each month saw a slight increase. When shooting to the third close, the cotton for this month broke through the one-yuan mark, and the popularity suddenly softened.

<p>Lack of Recent Receipt of Goods, Cotton Wants to Rise and Turn Back</p>
<p>The cotton market began to be firm and then turned back, and the situation became more and more weak. The trend of American cotton is harmonious, but three-grade cotton is still declining, Indian cotton is still falling, and there is a lack of recent receivers. This month broke through the one-yuan mark, and the month fell under the influence of the yuan. The bulls of Tongji slightly blocked the way, and Changhe Daji purchased in large quantities.</p>

Sellers in the market were not enthusiastic. Changhe and Runkang were particularly strong in dragging in. As a result, each month rose by 5 cents to 2 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market was average when it opened in the afternoon. After the second round, due to the sudden rise in the current month, Tongfan, Changfeng, Xincheng, Hexing, and Hengyi unanimously dumped, and the market price became more difficult to support. This month broke through the one-yuan mark, and the month was involved in the vortex. However, Dafu, Daji, Senkang, Changhe, and others still pulled in.

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association set the opening price for 24 coarse white sand at 22.5 yuan, and transit goods at 7.25 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Goods from the local warehouse were slightly sold at 22.6 yuan. Eastern red, eastern white, and cotton white from the local factory showed no fluctuations. Chao merchants continued to open three hundred bales of green and red sugar, with prices similar to the previous day. Guang merchants opened over two hundred and several dozen pieces of "Nan Ning Pian Qing," at 8.6 yuan. Lian merchants opened four hundred and ten bags of new miscellaneous red sugar at 13.5 yuan. Due to the first appearance of the new crop and the poorer color, the opening price was lowered by four or five cents, and weak sales contributed to the price drop. The future market seems to remain stable.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Metals: Black Sheet Iron Prices Rise Daily <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Recent arrivals of black iron sheets have been minimal, resulting in shallow market inventories. However, factories using this material are actively seeking supplies, leading to brisk transactions. With limited inventories, there is not enough to distribute, and the market outlook appears to be improving daily. The price of 26-gauge 18-piece sheets is estimated at 9.7 yuan, another increase of 25 cents compared to before. 36-gauge colored sheets are estimated at 9 yuan, also up a solid 15 cents. Yesterday, the market saw transactions of over two or three hundred bundles, but there were still many buyers, so the market outlook is likely to remain positive.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Ah Sen and His Ox <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>It seemed to be his habitual action. When his yellowish-wax teeth were biting on that old and smooth short tobacco pipe, Ah Sen always had to shake his head, letting that long braid sway a bit, before he would desperately search inside his few ragged clothes with both hands.</p>
<p>A short red-headed match was fished out, struck on the ground with a "whoosh," the tobacco pipe glowed red for a moment, and then his mouth sucked forcefully. Rings of smoke followed his comfortable breath and flew out, gradually dissipating in the fields.</p>
<p>Now, Ah Sen sat down on the bluestone slab, and like the smoke rings flying out of his mouth, his mind also vaguely fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>The November sun was as warm as in the second or third month of spring, shining on the already plowed land like golden fish scales. On the uncultivated land, many sparrows chirped, pecking at the golden, desolate ears of grain. It was indeed a time very suitable for deep thought.</p>
<p>Ah Sen narrowed his eyes and counted the land he had already plowed. The golden fish scales were all smiling at him, and so his heart smiled as well.</p>
<p>"Soon, soon, only the two 'mu' and five 'fen' on the east side are left."</p>
<p>Suddenly, two clumsy sounds startled him. He turned his head: it was his ox, struggling clumsily and resisting the rope. He angrily knocked his smooth tobacco pipe hard on the bluestone slab, scolding loudly, "Beast! Beast! Beast! Hey! Hey!"</p>
<p>The beast calmed down, and he slowly thought, thought, with half-closed eyes. A murmuring, self-talking sound rumbled: "This beast, it's suffered enough with me. After plowing these two 'mu' and five 'fen', I should buy some 'flower cakes' to nourish it…"</p>
<p>Flower cakes? At the mention of flower cakes, he immediately thought of lace. The round cakes not only looked like lace and sounded like it; but the way the price of flower cakes kept rising day by day was truly as precious as the steadily decreasing pattern. This made his heart tighten, and he immediately felt a chill.</p>
<p>He put away his tobacco pipe, tied it to his belt, and walked into deep thought with even more dazed eyes.</p>
<p>Winter plowing is finished… flower cakes are really not important. What is important is still the three-person family's food… He thought again of his eternally miserable wife, who spent her life mending torn clothes, carrying grain sacks, carrying dung buckets, being scolded… Gradually, his thoughts turned to Ah Fu, who was cutting ox grass in the graveyard across the way. This child was also too miserable, still wearing only a single cloth shirt and pants, and snow was coming soon.</p>
<p>And so, he thought of borrowing grain on credit. Under the current circumstances before the New Year, it was absolutely necessary to borrow some grain on credit. If he borrowed it, he could live comfortably this year, and he would have the capital to sow next year… Old Jin Rong suddenly jumped into his mind, his rat-like eyes smiling slyly, calculating other people's property again. When the one 'dan' of grain he had squeezed from him a month ago was sold on the market, he could squeeze two 'dan'…</p>
<p>A startling sound interrupted his deep thought:</p>
<p>"Runaway ox! Runaway ox!"</p>
<p>It was Ah Fu and many other children cutting grass in the graveyard across the way who were shouting. Ah Sen immediately turned his gaze from the graveyard, and sure enough, his ox had broken the rope and run away. He stood up abruptly, chasing after it as quickly as the wind, gesturing urgently to Ah Fu across the way:</p>
<p>"Ah Fu! Ah Fu! I'll cut over there! Stop it! Stop it!"</p>
<p>The ox, like a lion escaped from its cage, had regained its primitive nature of thousands of years ago, stamping its hooves violently, its tail cocked up angrily, its head lowered, its two horns flying like two arrows. It leaped over the mud clods like fish scales, it stepped on the withered yellow rice roots, it frightened away the flock of golden sparrows pecking at the desolate ears of grain, and leaped over the heads of the grass-cutting children, heading straight towards the graveyard.</p>
<p>Ah Sen gasped for breath, the tobacco pipe on his belt constantly hitting his hand, the long braid on his head constantly flicking his eyes, he was being hindered; while the beast seemed to be going faster and faster. He gasped, gasped, walked, walked, and finally saw the beast stop.</p>
<p>Standing on that desolate little hill, it was chewing on the tender green grass beside the graves, its tongue often reaching out to lick its steaming nostrils, its tail swaying leisurely. Surely, it thought this place was somewhere beyond the human world. Later, it wanted to regard the small hill as a wild mountain. Like other wild beasts in caves, it would make this its hometown. Later, it thought it would definitely be able to escape its fetters and labor entirely for itself in this paradise of its hometown. Surely, it also thought that later it would begin its beautiful life.</p>
<p>But this was still a place where Ah Sen could reach. He had already caught up, panting. He smiled and scolded:</p>
<p>"Beast! Beast! This is a graveyard! This is a graveyard!" He called out the word "graveyard" especially loudly, as if to say, "You're stepping into the grave!"</p>
<p>Seeing Ah Sen chasing after it, the beast returned to its primitive nature, digging its horns into the gaps in the graves. With a "whoosh," its head turned into the grave, but its tail was swaying leisurely and triumphantly outside the grave.</p>
<p>Ah Sen's laughter was even louder. This was almost the first mad laugh of his life. He rushed over, forcefully dragging its tail, trying to pull it out of the grave; all the while still laughing loudly.</p>
<p>The head in the grave angrily called out: "Moo!"</p>
<p>No one knew how, but suddenly it was as if a sharp arrow pierced Ah Sen's heart, and his laughter stopped abruptly. His rough fingers let go of the tail, hanging down like wooden chicken claws, and every wrinkle on his face was etched out. Whether it was sweat or tears, glistening with the color of the November sunlight, flowing down in a rustling stream from his staring eyes, from every wrinkle, from his dirty cloth shirt. He was stunned. He was thinking of the time when he had evaded rent and fled to a mountain cave, and later Old Boss Jin Rong had found him, dragging him out of the cave by his braid!</p>
<h3 id="e193">Glimpses of Ginza <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Mu</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, 1935 has reached "year's end." Japan's magazine industry is known for being ahead of schedule; next year's "New Year's" and "New Year's Issues" are already out. Newspapers these days are also filled with advertisements for major department stores' "Year-End Grand Raffle" and "Year-End Sale." If you go for a walk in the Ginza area at night, these days it's even more lively than in the past, everyone is busy, and women are even more busy going in and out of department stores buying things, buying gifts. It is the scene of preparing for the New Year.</p>
<p>Wherever you go, as soon as it's almost the New Year, it's always more lively than usual. But this "liveliness," sometimes although it looks lively on the surface, in reality it's often even more desolate than usual. Isn't Tokyo exactly like this?</p>
<p>Yes. Several of Tokyo's largest department stores, such as Mitsukoshi, Takashimaya, and Matsuzakaya, are all taking advantage of this "year-end" opportunity to hold "grand sales." Colorful goods are piled high in beautiful glass display windows, and the stores' "female clerks" are also more diligent in serving customers than usual, but buying things always requires money! Except for a small number of true "capitalists"; most middle-class or small property owners can only pick out a cheap item or two and that's it. Sometimes, after picking and choosing for a long time; they find the goods are really good; but in the end, the expression of having to give up because the price is too expensive can often be found on the faces of general shoppers. I don't know how many people run through the department stores in a day, but probably less than half of them actually buy something and leave?</p>
<p>For the "year-end" "grand raffle" and "grand sale"; the neon lights of Ginza are even more dazzling these days. Luxury, brilliance, and the sound of music drift everywhere. But right next to these largest dance halls or department stores, in the small alleys, there are people holding their own children, shivering and kneeling in the darkness begging for alms. When noble ladies and gentlemen pass by these beggars, their eyes disdain to even look at them; it's still "year-end," and these beggars have no way to participate in the "imperial ladies and gentlemen's" work of preparing for the New Year. I think, the existence of these beggars in the darkness is the greatest threat to Ginza's year-end prosperity. Because even if Ginza's department stores, bars, and dance halls' neon lights are brighter, the dark places are still more numerous than the bright places!</p>

<p>— Fei Xiong</p>
<p>After the gloomy autumn, the winter wind and clouds blew in from the north.</p>
<p>A stone began to be taken from the heart, and flames suddenly sprouted in the winter rain and snow. Night. A long snake stretched out in the darkness, leaving darkness behind it. The clock struck, ringing out the cries long suppressed in the heart; cries awakened the resurrected dream.</p>
<p>Is the north wind blowing? Stirring up the waves of China. Is the dew heavy? Dripping away the troubled dreams from the heart.</p>
<p>With empty stomachs, staggeringly leaning on other people's shoulders; other people are leaning on other people's shoulders. Trudge on, the sky will brighten.</p>
<p>Shout, shout, even the shadows of the trees are swaying. What is tomorrow? What has tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Do your feet hurt? No, the road is long! Is your throat parched? There is nectar ahead.</p>
<p>Joy slipped from young people's mouths to young people's hearts; light flashed from young people's hearts to the hearts of the masses.</p>
<p>"There's bread to eat."</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>"We don't want bread!"</p>
<p>"Down with ××!"</p>
<p>"Support ××!"</p>
<p>"…!"</p>
<p>On the street:</p>
<p>The street is crowded with people, a wooden stick strikes down. Women pass by solemnly: belts stand solemnly. ×× people's armored cars are coming, blue-eyed fire trucks are coming.</p>
<p>The carriages are crowded with people; the iron railings are also crowded with people.</p>
<p>The train glides along the tracks with a soft rumble.</p>
<p>"Don't kneel! Don't cry!"</p>
<p>Laugh! Laugh! Stand up straight!</p>

<p>— Xi Cun</p>
<p>If you have ever been unemployed, and for a very long period, when you are desperately seeking work and finally find a position, then you are the most aware of the true feelings involved. I mean, you can then imagine how diligent and devoted I would be to this newly acquired job. Truly, because I couldn't find work for so long, I almost despaired and fantasized about how best to commit suicide. People can do anything when they are at their wit's end.</p>
<p>From six in the evening to twelve midnight is the working time for my new job. In a typesetting room, nine of us dirty-handed workers are crammed together, covered head to toe in a layer of lead dust and grease. Although the meager pay is embarrassing to mention, I knew how to be punctual and work without laziness or shortcuts for this new job.</p>
<p>Logically, a typesetting workshop for night work should have particularly bright electric lights. But in reality, it wasn't so. Our dark room only had two electric lights, and the bulbs were only fifteen candlepower each. How could that possibly provide enough light? Fortunately, this unusually small room had no windows on three sides, and the only side with a window was blocked by a high wall, making it airtight. The darkness was actually a little brighter, but as a result, the stuffy air was more than enough for people to bear. Luckily, it was winter. If it were summer, I think the workers would certainly turn into sweat-soaked ghosts. Even the heat could kill several people a year.</p>
<p>Five of us were either typesetting or working as printers. The type cases were arranged in a dark, blurry array in the corner. The order in which they were arranged was based on the radical index of ordinary dictionaries. Before searching for a character, one had to first think about which radical it belonged to, which was both mentally and visually taxing. As a novice, I found it very inconvenient.</p>
<p>My colleague Zhao Mazi once offered the boss a suggestion on this matter, saying, "Boss, I think it would be best if these types were arranged according to the 'Four-Corner Code' character indexing method. It would definitely be much more convenient to find them in the future."</p>
<p>What is the "Four-Corner Code?" I didn't quite know. I guessed that this thing with a strange name must be difficult to learn. So, wasn't Zhao Mazi intentionally playing a joke on me, a newcomer? I didn't approve, who would pay attention to this strange way! But as luck would have it, before I could object, the boss refused first. He stroked his figure-eight mustache, took a puff of his water pipe, and said with a frown, "What four-corner, five-corner stuff, I don't understand those things. How did China get messed up? You know? It's all because of one trick here and another trick there! It's easier to deal with fewer tricks. The more there are, the easier it is to go wrong and the harder it is to get on the right track!"</p>
<p>"It's convenient, it's really fast to find characters," Zhao Mazi continued, disregarding the boss's bad mood, to supplement his opinion.</p>
<p>After hearing this, the boss put down his water pipe, glared at Zhao Mazi with a distorted face as if he wanted to swallow him whole, and said angrily, "No! No! A thousand times no! You say it's convenient, but I say it's inconvenient! Besides, can you guarantee that you'll work here for the rest of your life? If you leave here one day for a better job, what will happen to the people who come later who don't know the four-corner, five-corner stuff? Trying to be convenient will only add more trouble!"</p>
<p>I was so happy that I jumped up. The boss's words were exactly what I was thinking. I couldn't help but interject, "The boss is absolutely right. Zhao Mazi, put away your new tricks. Don't bother anymore and don't invite trouble for yourself."</p>
<p>What I will never forget is Zhao Mazi's angry glare at me at that moment, full of hostility. He shouted loudly, "You bastard, you want to chime in too? Why don't you go play cards to protect your eyes? Do you want to be blind!"</p>
<p>That night, after leaving the typesetting room, I felt uncomfortable as I walked along. Zhao Mazi shouldn't have called me a bastard in front of the boss. He was clearly insulting me! I wanted to find him and argue. Just then, he caught up with me from behind, panting heavily. As if he had seen through my intention to question and argue with him, he grabbed my shoulder, smiled, and said, "Brother, I beg you, don't be angry, okay? I have something to tell you."</p>
<p>I didn't answer, and I really got angry. I was blaming him. Seeing that I didn't say a word, it obviously caused him inner anxiety. He forcefully pulled my hand, held it tightly, and still smiled as he said to me:</p>
<p>"I was too reckless, but you are too suspicious. A worker doesn't speak according to books, you know. I was wrong, please forgive me this time."</p>
<p>"I'm not angry, so what do you want me to forgive you for?" I had originally planned to make a fuss, but now I felt a little embarrassed. I regretted that I was too narrow-minded. Zhao Mazi's uninhibited spirit was really admirable. My reply was very unnatural, and a clever person might think I was lying and still angry.</p>
<p>Zhao Mazi was straightforward enough. He completely believed my reply, and a sincere, friendly smile appeared on his face. He then changed the subject.</p>
<p>The streets were particularly quiet at midnight. This area was also secluded, so there were no vehicles coming and going. Besides the two of us, the only things moving were the cold winter wind and the shadows of the two of us, sometimes long and sometimes short, reflected under the streetlights.</p>
<p>"Brother, you are young," Zhao Mazi said after walking for a while, looking at me again, "Believe me, okay? You're not angry with me anymore, right? Let me tell you, do you know the ultimate benefit of being a typesetter? That benefit will get you two red eyes—all because you're searching for lead type and rolling around in it, ruining your eyes. I said using the 'Four-Corner Code' was for my own sake, to make searching easier and less strenuous on the eyes. You misunderstood my good intentions."</p>
<p>"But that's because I didn't know what the 'Four-Corner Code' was. I really thought it would add trouble, so I objected. To be honest, you didn't teach me how to use it, so you can't blame me."</p>
<p>Later, one day, after I learned the "Four-Corner Code" character indexing method from him, I really felt the convenience of the indexing itself and said to him, "Mazi, this method is good. I really misunderstood you before." I regretted that I had learned it so late and said apologetically, "Why didn't you tell me earlier? Wouldn't it have been good to cheer you on when you asked the boss to adopt it that time?" I really regretted that missed opportunity. I thought that if the two of us had suggested it together, the boss might have accepted our opinion. That would have been so good.</p>
<p>"It's not too late to talk about it now. As long as there's a reason, we can always talk about it."</p>
<p>Two days later, the two of us did indeed tell the boss about this idea. The two of us were the ones who took the lead, and the other partners also said some words of support from the side because they had all learned this new "Four-Corner Code" character indexing method.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" The boss first snorted, glanced at me, and asked back, "Xiao Liuzi, you're also saying these new tricks now? Didn't you disapprove of them before?"</p>
<p>"Because now I know that this method is really much more convenient."</p>
<p>"Much more convenient? I just don't want it to be convenient, see what you can do!" he said angrily, slamming the water pipe on the table. "Others say that the new bookkeeping method is convenient; I still use the old-fashioned ledger and haven't been killed by the inconvenience! Is it good to change things often? The ancestral methods are so precious, how can they be easily changed? Nonsense is simply bewitched! Fine, you go reform, go find a place with 'four-corner' and 'five-corner' methods to work at. I can't keep such talented people here! Consider it that I respect you!"</p>
<p>The business was therefore suspended. It was hard enough to find a job, and now I was unemployed again, which was really heartbreaking. At first, I still blamed Zhao Mazi's Four-Corner Code for harming people, but after thinking about it and understanding the business sense of the boss-type people, there was nothing to be unhappy about. Sooner or later, this small setback at work would happen anyway, so what did it matter!</p>

<h3 id="e197">Watching the Moon <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>Not long after nightfall, I happened to raise my head from my desk. Then, leaning back in my chair, I saw the moon through the window across the courtyard, forming a diagonal line. It seemed like a discovery, and I couldn't help but say,</p>
<p>"There's a moon tonight!"</p>
<p>Immediately, I had another thought, "Today" is already the tenth day of the lunar month. There should have been one long ago. I was starting to feel a little regretful about saying those unconscious words, even though the words were also said unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Is this the first time you've seen the moon this month?" my wife asked, with a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>I was a little dazed: "The first time, what?"</p>
<p>"The first time you see the moon in a month, if you see it sitting down, you won't be busy this month. If you see it walking, you'll be busy. If you see it sleeping, you'll be even less busy."</p>
<p>"Is there such a saying?" But I knew what she meant.</p>
<p>"It's a common saying."</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was some kind of mental effect. Hearing "common saying," I thought, it's not accidental. Comparatively speaking, isn't walking busy? Isn't sitting idle? Isn't sleeping even more idle?</p>
<p>However, there is still a bit of leisure when walking and seeing the moon. "Appreciating the moon" and "walking by the moon" are different. Sitting doesn't necessarily mean seeing it, and sleeping is even more about falling asleep. Conversely, there are people who "watch the moon" while walking, sitting, and sleeping. This is considered "avoiding convention."</p>
<h3 id="e198">On Nibbling and Chewing Words <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Since last year, there has been an issue that everyone has not paid much attention to, but which is actually quite important, namely the so-called "nibbling and chewing words." Although few people participated in the discussion, the opinions on this issue can still be divided into two factions. One faction is purely opposed to it, believing that nibbling and chewing words is not literature. To have good literature, one must learn from real life. The other faction, in addition to opposing the abuses of tradition, also gave nibbling and chewing words a new meaning, believing that appropriate nibbling and chewing of words is precisely the cultivation of literary skills.</p>
<p>My opinion is closer to the latter.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Yanbo of the Tang Dynasty, when writing articles, always wrote Fengge as Yingge, Longmen as Qiuhu, Jingu as Xianxi, Yushan as Qiongyu, and Zhuma as Xiaocan. This was not to match the facts, but to seek depth and make it difficult to understand. This is chewing words. Mr. Kong Yiji, when he saw the children asking him for fennel beans, shook his head and said, "Not much, not much! Is it much? Not much." He was not writing a love poem, nor was he citing classics, but he insisted on finding phrases close to books. This is nibbling words. We should oppose such nibbling and chewing of words. People who use beautiful rhetoric and elegant language to disguise the emptiness of the content of their articles will only be rejected, opposed, and slowly decline in the literary world today.</p>
<p>But why do I also approve of nibbling and chewing words? Because the nibbling and chewing words I am talking about has a different new meaning. I believe that a person should be careful and prudent when writing or reading their own or other people's articles, and nibbling and chewing words fits this condition. What we want to nibble out and chew out is not beauty, superficiality, or elegance, but concise, clear, precise, correct, simple, and factual words.</p>
<p>Soviet new writers greatly admired the efforts of past classical writers to polish their works. Tolstoy rewrote "War and Peace" seven times, Lermontov had to revise a line several times, and Chekhov once said, "When a manuscript is finished, it must be allowed to lie down and heal." These things were spread among them and became beautiful stories. Why? Because the correct, concise, clear, and simple use of words must rely heavily on nibbling and chewing.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a passage in this journal:</p>
<p>"In the past, literati suffered greatly from the grinding of words, to the extent that some spent years on a single word and ten years on a single composition. Bai Letian's poems were all considered to have been revised by Yang Wenzhong Gong after he finished writing, pasted them on the wall, sat and lay down to observe them, corrected them to the best of his ability, and then showed them to others. Dazong once obtained several drafts of poems by Mr. Dongpo at Wangzhi's place, the grandson of Wenzhong Gong. His poem in response to Ou Shubi said: 'Yuanming as a small city, then circled it to write it down, changed it to find the word, and then smeared out the two words 'small city' to make 'county magistrate,' changing the word three times to form the current sentence. As for 'pepper in small amounts, why use eight hundred pecks,' he first said: 'pepper also why use,' then stored eight hundred pecks. If it were like the initial words, it would inevitably be criticized by future generations. It is also known that even great writers do not rely on momentary inspiration to determine the words, but are afraid of editing them."</p>
<p>Although we feel that spending years on a single word and ten years on a single composition is a bit too cautious and somewhat ridiculous. However, the fact remains that an important word must be carefully considered, and a great work should be nurtured for many years.</p>
<p>Shen Yiqing also has a statement:</p>
<p>"Ancient people did not abandon the method of refining words, but they won with meaning, not with words. One can see oddness in ordinary words, danger in common words, newness in old words, and color in plain words. Modern people who use words to show off their skills only make them difficult."</p>
<p>This also explains what we should nibble and chew. Yes, we need a rich vocabulary, but we do not advocate abandoning books. However, the books from which we absorb vocabulary must be modern and ordinary. On this point, because of the needs of reality, we can quote foreign, that is, so-called Europeanized, sentences, but we absolutely do not have to look for difficult words and ancient phrases in Zhuangzi and Wenxuan to "show off our skills."</p>
<p>This "unnecessary" is precisely the result of nibbling and chewing.</p>
<p>In addition to books, what is more important is to learn, adopt, and quote local languages from real life—especially local languages that everyone can understand. The important thing is selection. Doesn't selection prove that we still have to nibble and chew?</p>
<p>Great works must have accurate, rich, and moving content. But this accurate, rich, and moving content is conveyed by writers through words. Therefore, we also do not forget to seek the perfection of these words. In other words, we seek formal success.</p>
<p>In this way, we need to nibble and chew.</p>

<p>(That is so weak!)</p>
<p>We don't need hypocritical sympathy,</p>
<p>Nor do we need clever rhetoric!</p>
<p>It is a vast public indignation</p>
<p>Burning vigorously, as if in the swirl of smoke</p>
<p>A roar of steel rises! !</p>
<p>Then we see our great power, unwavering is our own banner,</p>
<p>Shouting out our own will;</p>
<p>It is a procession seeking a way out,</p>
<p>Struggling on the line of death.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Opening Declaration <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Our company, Da Sun Co., Ltd., is affiliated with Hong Kong Da Sun Co., Ltd. It was founded in the first year of the Republic of China. Branches and stores were subsequently established on Xidi and Huiai Middle Road in Guangzhou, operating department stores and also engaging in hotel, restaurant, and rooftop garden businesses. Adhering to the principle of sincerity and mutual trust, we have striven to operate diligently without any slackening. We have been deeply favored by people from all walks of life. Over the past two decades, our business has made considerable progress. While feeling encouraged, we have been thinking about how to better serve the community. Therefore, we raised funds to organize a Shanghai branch some time ago. Now, fortunately, the new building has been completed and business has begun. We are willing to continue to serve the society with the same principles of sincerity and trustworthiness. We will do our utmost to promote domestic products, working together with manufacturers to facilitate sales. As we are just beginning our business, our facilities may not be complete. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will come and patronize us and provide guidance. We would be extremely grateful. This declaration is made for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Cai Chang, General Supervisor of Shanghai Da Sun Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Position of Da Sun Department Store <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Julean Arnold, U.S. Commercial Attaché to China</p>
<p>Citizens benefit greatly from a well-organized department store. Because of its thorough planning and huge investment, it can collect goods from all sources and therefore offer surprisingly low prices. This is something that small-scale merchants cannot hope to match. A department store gathers all kinds of goods under one roof. Showcases stand in rows, and everything is in good order. Customers can see everything at a glance and can get what they want without having to wander through the streets. Moreover, the prices are fixed, so there is no need to haggle. The staff is sincere and provides excellent service. In addition, the organization is Chinese-owned and has extensive experience. It is only natural that its threshold is worn through and its business is booming.</p>
<p>With skilled workers and excellent materials, a magnificent building has been built. The painted beams and carved rafters of the grand pavilion reach into the clouds. The towering building is high and commanding. Its novel facilities include escalators, so customers can move from floor to floor without lifting a foot. The displays in its windows and corridors are magnificent, and the ladies who visit are all delighted.</p>
<p>Chinese department stores are more advanced than their American counterparts in terms of entertainment facilities. They have everything from singing and dancing to banquets, tea gardens, and cinemas, taking into account both trade and art. This is truly a unique feature.</p>
<p>Department stores collect goods from all over the world. Treasures from all corners of the earth are displayed in one room, earning it the nickname "permanent international exposition." They also display countless Chinese handicrafts, which are beautiful beyond compare. Ladies from Europe and America who are traveling and stop in Shanghai can visit the store to observe the actual development of Chinese industry. Therefore, department stores are eager to promote inexpensive and exquisite indigenous products. In addition to presenting foreign products, department stores play a very important role in the country's industry.</p>
<h3 id="e202">A General Description of Shanghai Da Sun Company <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Jianwen</p>
<p>Shanghai is a port city with a dense population and a mix of Chinese and foreigners. It is the focus of attention both at home and abroad and is the only major port in the East. The promotion of domestic products is a major priority here, and the city is closely related to the world economy and domestic finance. Moreover, construction has been progressing rapidly in recent years. The Greater Shanghai Plan is being realized, and magnificent buildings are everywhere. Now, between Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, and Labour Road, there is another towering structure that rises into the clouds. The location is convenient for transportation, with a constant flow of traffic. It is a sight that attracts everyone's attention. What is it? It is the Da Sun Company, which is officially opening today.</p>
<p>Da Sun Company, as the name suggests, is undoubtedly grand in scale and novel in its facilities. However, Da Sun Company is not only refreshing in Shanghai, but also a leader among department stores in China. The company was founded in Hong Kong in the first year of the Republic of China. It has also operated two branches in Guangzhou for more than 20 years. It has always been committed to serving the community, with fixed prices and small profits and large sales. Therefore, people from all walks of life have praised it and regarded it as the only place to buy goods. The success of the Hong Kong and Guangzhou branches is not accidental.</p>
<p>Now, in view of the need for a new type of department store in Shanghai, the company has actively prepared for and added a Shanghai branch. It has now been completed and will continue to operate with its original purpose, striving to meet the expectations of the community. Its facilities and features are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Beautiful Architecture: The company's building stands between Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, and Labour Road, occupying eight acres of land. It is ten stories high and built using the steel-frame concrete construction method. It was designed by the local Jitai Engineering Firm. The latest architectural principles were adopted for the light and air throughout the building. The exterior walls are made of domestic milky-yellow glazed ceramic tiles, and the facade is made of black granite from Qingdao. The interior floors are paved with Italian stone, and the second and third floors are covered with rubber and teak floors. The interior and exterior are extremely clean and beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) New-Style Elevators: The company's new-style elevators are fast and comfortable. The opening and closing of the elevator doors are automatic and do not require human labor. Customers find them very convenient to use.</p>
<p>(3) Lighting: Department stores are public places where all kinds of goods are displayed and crowds gather, so it is necessary to ensure that the lighting is suitable. Moreover, in order to accurately identify the color of the goods being selected, accurate lighting is essential. Therefore, the company has paid special attention to the lighting, so that customers who enter the building feel refreshed and are very satisfied with their selection of goods. This is enough to show the novelty of the company's facilities and its consideration for customers.</p>
<p>(4) Climate: Adjusting the indoor temperature is a major issue in modern new building facilities. The company has paid close attention to this point. The interior is equipped with heating and cooling pipes, so there is no severe cold in winter and no extreme heat in summer, creating an image of perpetual spring.</p>
<p>(5) Escalators: Department stores are distributed over several floors, and customers who are shopping are inevitably inconvenienced by having to go up and down. Therefore, recent great buildings have been equipped with elevators for going up and down. However, they are still insufficient when customers are crowded. In view of this, the company has not only installed the latest type of elevators, but has also added two escalators, which run directly from the pavement to the third floor. This is the first installation of its kind in the country. Customers only need to stand on it to go up and down the stairs steadily and quickly. This is a unique innovation in vertical transportation facilities.</p>
<p>(6) Goods Display: The arrangement of the various goods in a department store requires a lot of study. The connectivity of the categories, the cleanliness of the layout, and the convenience of supply are all related to the psychology and selection of customers. The company has paid special attention to this and has ensured that the pedestrian areas are spacious to avoid crowding and create a comfortable atmosphere.</p>
<p>(7) Department Configuration: The company is currently using the first to fourth floors as commercial areas, and the fifth floor and above as entertainment venues. It is located in the bustling center of Shanghai, and the grand racecourse is in front of it. The square offers a clear view and fresh air, which is not easy to find in other bustling areas. The internal distribution is listed below as a guide.</p>
<p>Basement: Southern goods, ham, sea cucumber and bird's nest, hardware, and inexpensive goods.</p>
<p>Ground Floor: Canned food, biscuits, fruit, foreign wines, cigars and cigarettes, camera materials, thermos bottles, eyeglasses, stationery, Chinese and Western medicines, cosmetics and fragrances, Western clothing, straw hats and felt hats, cotton underwear, head brushes and combs, handkerchiefs and towels, silk and wool socks, women's handbags, umbrellas, wallets, gift certificates, and flowers.</p>
<p>Second Floor: Felt carpets, silverware, ivory enamelware, watches from all over the world, telescopes, musical instruments, toys, furniture, leather trunks, Fuzhou lacquerware, Jiangxi porcelain, glass porcelain, and electrical appliances.</p>
<p>Third Floor: Gauze silks and satins, wool and cloth, fine wool fabrics, Chinese and Western clothing, Beijing-Suzhou clothing trim, women's clothing, children's clothing, and Chinese and Western boots and shoes.</p>
<p>Fourth Floor: General office, purchasing department, warehouse, and product exhibition hall.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Summary of the Architectural Plan of the Shanghai Da Sun Company <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Architect: Kee Tai Engineering Firm</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>The location is at the western end of Nanjing Road, Shanghai, bordering streets on three sides, occupying 200 feet of Nanjing Road, and 320 feet each of Lloyd Road and Tibet Road, totaling an area of 8.2 mu. The location is ideal, adjacent to major department stores, major hotels, and amusement parks.</p>
<p>Size</p>
<p>The storefront on Nanjing Road is 190 feet east-west and 220 feet north-south, covering an area of 430 square zhang, or 5.5 mu. The four floors above ground and the basement are used for commercial space, while the upper four floors and the rooftop are used for amusement facilities and a rooftop garden. The total height from the ground to the roof is 127 feet, with a total of ten floors including the basement. The highest point accessible to visitors is 140 feet. The total volume of the building is estimated to be 5 million cubic feet, making it one of the largest buildings in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Basement</p>
<p>The basement is designed as a commercial space, a common practice in many countries, but a pioneering effort in Shanghai. The Da Sun Company management carefully considered this plan and believed that it would be highly beneficial to both the company and its customers. However, thorough planning was required for damp-proofing and transportation. Currently, the southern side of the basement is a sales area, occupying two-thirds of the total area. In addition to elevators, there are four grand staircases in the front and rear connecting to the upper-level storefront entrances, and one staircase in the middle connecting to the middle floor for convenience. Receiving and delivery facilities are also attached to benefit customers. The northwest corner is the machine room, which is not connected to the storefront and can be accessed directly from the outer courtyard. The northeast corner is the area for receiving goods, unpacking, and temporary storage, with a separate exit.</p>
<p>The basement is nine feet below ground, with a four-foot space under the floor to provide damp-proofing and space for various pipes. All exterior walls are made of reinforced concrete with damp-proofing measures.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Mr. Cai Chang, General Supervisor of Da Sun Company <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>First Floor</p>
<p>With entrances on three sides facing the street, there are a total of seven entrances, four staircases leading to the upper-level shopping area, three passenger elevators, one freight elevator, and one pneumatic tube delivery system. The locations of these staircases have been carefully studied to ensure proper distribution and convenient transportation. In addition, there is an escalator from the first floor to the second floor, which is unique among Shanghai companies. Located in the middle, each elevator can transport 4,000 people per hour, eliminating concerns about waiting and crowding. Customers can stand and ascend, with an unobstructed view of the store's interior, which is even more convenient.</p>
<p>The first floor has a total of 3,000 feet of counters, the most among major companies in Shanghai. The walkways are as wide as eleven feet, preventing overcrowding.</p>
<p>The three sides of the first floor facing the street have a mezzanine, used for staff rest and storage. The central atrium is 130 feet square and 19 feet high, providing ample space and ventilation.</p>
<p>The interior decoration of the department store and shops is mainly simple and harmonious, as customers' attention is on the goods, not the building. Therefore, except for the Italian marble floor and the plain ceiling using new construction methods, all small beams are eliminated except for the main beams.</p>
<p>Second, Third, and Fourth Floors</p>
<p>All are shopping areas, with each floor having 3,400 square feet of space, four staircases, and three elevators directly accessible from the lower floors. Each floor has restrooms for men and women. The internal counter arrangements have been carefully studied before installation.</p>
<p>The southern part of the fourth floor is the Da Sun Company's office, the western part is the warehouse, the eastern part is a tea room, and the central part is a product display area, providing guidance for customers' shopping and promotion for domestic manufacturers. This is another special contribution of Da Sun Company to Shanghai society.</p>
<p>Fifth Floor to the Top</p>
<p>All four floors are public entertainment areas, namely amusement parks. According to the current plan, the fifth floor is reserved for a large theater, the sixth floor is a cinema, and the rest are divided into various amusement activities. Separate staircases and four elevators are provided on Lloyd Road and Tibet Road for access to these floors, not connected to the commercial area.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the entertainment area of the entire building can accommodate 20,000 spectators at the same time. When the facilities are completed and the opening ceremony is held, it can be considered the largest popular amusement park in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Magnificent Appearance</p>
<p>Department store buildings are naturally judged by their size, so this building strives for simplicity, with a slight Chinese style, and the rich colors are all on the upper floors to match the amusement park area. The lower part of the large awning is the display window area, using more luxurious materials, namely Chinese black labradorite, while the upper floors use tiles, striving for simplicity and lasting beauty.</p>
<p>Construction Method</p>
<p>Undertaken in stages, the piling work is carried out first, with a total of 214 piles of 110 feet long and 862 piles of 90 feet long. The civil engineering work, from the foundation to the roof, is all constructed with reinforced concrete frames, striving for solidity. The internal and external walls are all made of hollow bricks. All other materials, such as floor slabs, are fireproof materials, so the entire building is fireproof, durable, and the entire reinforced concrete plan has been carefully studied to save costs, with all beams and columns kept simple.</p>
<p>Other Facilities</p>
<p>In addition to civil engineering, there are still electrical wiring, heating, sanitation, and fire protection components. The first floor and basement are equipped with the latest air-conditioning pipes to purify the air and facilitate the preservation of goods. The entire building is equipped with heating and cooling fans (Unit Heater), and the temperature inside the shopping area is more than ten degrees higher than outside, providing comfort for customers. Each floor is equipped with toilets and sanitary facilities, and the entire building is equipped with fire sprinkler systems, further ensuring the safety of goods and customers.</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Visit to the Da Sun Company <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhen Yi)</p>
<p>On the morning of January 3rd, in the piercing north wind, Mr. Yao Junwei and I went to visit Mr. Liang Bingjian at the temporary office of the Da Sun Company on Tibet Road. Although the office was located in a few ordinary houses, the intense and active work of the internal staff, full of a vigorous spirit of enterprise, gave outsiders a fresh feeling upon entering the door. Mr. Liang is the company's chief accountant. Although he is also from Guangdong, he has lived in Shanghai for many years, so he speaks fluent Shanghainese. He humbly invited us to rest for a while and then led us to visit the new building. We started from the bottom floor. The basement construction is deeply buried underground and includes the southern goods section, ginseng and bird's nest section, hardware and blood tonic section, bargain section, and furnace room, among other sections. The perimeter of the building is equipped with hot and cold air ducts. It is said that whether it is the scorching summer or the severe winter, the temperature inside can always be maintained between sixty and seventy degrees, warm as spring all year round, making people feel very comfortable. The glass counters in each section have also been meticulously designed. The joints at each corner do not use wooden columns but are inlaid with a delicate metal, allowing customers walking past the counters to have a clear view of the goods displayed inside, without obstructing anyone's line of sight. Next to the furnace room is a cloakroom for employees to hang their clothes. The Da Sun Company has a total of more than 600 employees, and more than 100 of them have received practical training at the head office and branches in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. When they serve in the future, they will all wear neat uniforms, and each person will hang their clothes according to their own number. Moreover, there are two large doors for entry and exit, so that good order can be maintained without confusion and crowding. The basement is very spacious, with light</p>
<h3 id="e207">Canned Goods Section of the Storefront <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

<p>and air being properly considered. Therefore, being there will never make you imagine that this is a basement.</p>
<p>The first floor of the store sells gift certificates, flowers, canned food, candies and biscuits, fruits, foreign wine, cigars, cigarettes, camera supplies, hot and cold water bottles, stationery, Chinese and Western medicines, cosmetics, Western-style clothing, straw hats, felt hats, cotton underwear, head combs, handkerchiefs, towels, silk and wool socks, women's handbags, umbrellas, wallets, and other items. The first floor of the store has a total of six large doors, and another door is specifically for accessing the amusement park. Therefore, even if there are crowds, there will never be a problem with particularly crowded entrances. The automatic elevators from the first floor of the basement have a total of six, and the drivers are female employees. The opening and closing of the elevator doors are automated by machines, without the need for manual labor from the drivers. This is also a rare new facility in Shanghai. In addition, there is also a motorized escalator, in the same form as ordinary stairs. Passengers only need to stand on the steps to ascend or descend quickly, without feeling dizzy and with convenience and speed. Each step can only accommodate one person, and it can carry more than 4,000 passengers per hour. At this time, the foreign engineer who built the escalator happened to be nearby. According to him, the application of this escalator is already widespread in foreign department stores or large institutions, but in China, the Da Sun Company is the first to install and use it. As he spoke, he led us to try it out, going all the way through the second floor and reaching the third floor, which indeed made people feel convenient and novel. It is expected that on the day of the opening, many people will be curious to try it out.</p>
<p>The second floor has billiards, bedding, silverware, enamelware, ivory, clocks and watches from various countries, telescopes, eyeglasses, musical instruments, toys, furniture, leather suitcases, trunks, Fuzhou lacquerware, glass and porcelain, electrical materials, electric lights, and other sections. When we visited, the porcelain section had already been arranged. These porcelains were designed with new styles by the company and then custom-made in Jiangxi, so not only is the quality excellent, but the style and patterns are also very modern. The second floor has gauze, silk, woolen cloth, fine furs, Chinese and Western clothing, Beijing-Suzhou clothing trims, women's clothing, children's clothing, Chinese and Western boots and shoes, and other sections. The equipment such as counters and clothes racks paid close attention to avoiding obstructing customers' view.</p>
<p>The shopping area includes four floors including the basement. After careful observation of the various facilities on each floor, I know that they really put a lot of effort into the design during construction. The fourth floor is the main office, with several rooms built in a separated manner. This can avoid the noise of guests talking and disrupting the mood of the staff. In front of the main office, there is a very wide area, which will be used for exhibiting goods or other works of art in the future. The fourth floor is prepared to set up a cafeteria, selling food and wine as economically as possible, so that the general salaried class working near Nanjing Road can spend very little money to eat a delicious meal here. From the fifth floor onwards, it is all amusement park areas. When we went up to visit, the workers were diligently doing decoration work, and everything was not yet ready. When it is arranged in the future, it will be a popular entertainment area with a variety of performances and melodious songs. We went all the way to the roof, where the howling north wind cracked people's skin, making people tremble. Looking down, the scenery of the whole of Shanghai is clearly visible, and the pedestrians and vehicles are as small as lice and squirming in the dust. This is truly a spectacle.</p>
<p>It took a total of two hours to see a rough overview of the new building of Da Sun Company. Finally, I thanked Mr. Liang, who led us on the visit, and went back with a satisfied mood.</p>

<h3 id="e209">What I Hope for from the Da Sun Company <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhen Yi)</p>
<p>The Da Sun Company, which has appeared in Shanghai with a new attitude with modern business methods and modernized architecture, has opened today! It will shake the Shanghai market and be active on the commercial battlefield. In today's sluggish economy, we have endless hopes for the opening of the Da Sun Company. We deeply hope that the colleagues of this large company can practice the following points.</p>
<p>(1) Strive to promote domestic products. Our country has suffered from the economic invasion of the great powers for several decades! Now our national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the social crisis is deepening day by day. If we do not rise up to promote domestic products and recover our rights, then the disaster of national subjugation will be imminent. At this stage of national crisis, in today's surging social depression, we feel that we cannot bear to ask whether any department stores specializing in foreign goods will be produced again; but on the other hand, we urgently need a large-scale modern department store to promote domestic products. In the past, the Da Sun Company has had a good reputation among the social elites for serving the society and promoting domestic products in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Now we hope that they will be more active in promoting domestic products in Shanghai. Although the great task of promoting domestic products is by no means something that a department store selling goods can simply take on, we always sincerely hope that they will try their best to unite with domestic manufacturers and cooperate to do this work. We know very well that in recent years, the production of domestic goods has made great leaps forward. There are many products that can simply overwhelm imported goods, but because the promoters are not good at their methods, even if there are good domestic goods, customers find it difficult to identify them, or simply do not know about them. With the great scale of the Da Sun Company and decades of commercial experience, if they can strive to promote domestic products, then I think the future of the domestic goods industry will definitely be greatly benefited, in other words, it can benefit both the society and the country.</p>
<p>(2) Uphold the credit of fixed prices. The Da Sun Company has always used fixed prices, honesty, and no deception as the basic principles of its business. We have seen that their business practices in Hong Kong and Guangzhou are like this, and now the opening declaration of the Shanghai Da Sun Company also clearly writes the words of adhering to the true meaning of fixed prices, which makes us very gratified! At the same time, we hope that they will always maintain this good principle and not be shaken by accommodating the environment. Because the original purpose of trading is to exchange what you have for what you don't have, each getting what they want, and neither party can cheat. Merchants in ancient times attached great importance to credit and honesty, and we should maintain this good habit. Although the Shanghai commercial environment has now been spoiled by some shops that are blinded by profit, making both buyers and sellers meticulous and haggling over prices, it is not impossible for the Da Sun Company to reverse this decline if it can adhere to the credit of fixed prices. The environment can be transformed by human effort, which is a belief that every business operator should have.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to service ethics. It is an undeniable fact that Chinese stores do not pay attention to service ethics. We hope that the colleagues working at the Da Sun Company can pay special attention to service ethics in the future, so that general customers, no matter how much goods they buy or how much business they do, feel satisfied and leave a good impression. At the same time, it can also let foreigners in Shanghai know that our Chinese modern stores have also paid attention to service ethics, changing their traditional bad impression of Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>(4) Focus on the needs of the masses. Since stores serve the society, the target of service should be the general public in the society. Therefore, whether in terms of sales or equipment, it should be based on adapting to the needs of the masses, and not just thinking about a few people, because the Da Sun Company must make the general public have a good impression in their minds that "the Da Sun Company is the ideal supplier of our daily necessities," and should not make it become a market only for a few people in the society. At the same time, in these years of poverty and exhaustion, the purchase of goods should be based on practicality and economy, and the selling price should also be reduced as much as possible, implementing a policy of low prices and high sales.</p>

<p>— (Nian Shu)</p>
<p>Recently, as long as you pass by the New World near Nanjing Road, you can clearly see a magnificent building, towering beside Nanjing Road and Tibet Road. This great building, which adorns the city's prosperity, is the new building of the Da Sun Company. It has already made every pedestrian on Nanjing Road unable to resist stopping to admire it, emitting bursts of admiration. The contractor of this great building is Fu Ji Construction Plant, and the person in charge of the entire construction project is Mr. Jin Fulin, the chief engineer of the plant. In order to make readers understand the construction process of the Da Sun Company's mansion, the reporter went to visit Mr. Jin the other day.</p>
<p>He is a very prestigious engineering expert in the country. The 22-story Chonglou of the Four Lines Savings Society standing proudly on Jing'an Temple Road in the Far East, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, and the Cemetery of Fallen Soldiers in the capital were all built with his efforts. The social elites have long had a fixed opinion on his achievements in serving the Fu Ji Construction Plant. But he is an amiable person, talking freely with the reporter, with absolutely no unnatural or exaggerated expressions. He said, "The new building of the Da Sun Company officially started construction on November 19th, 23rd year of the Republic of China and was completed in the winter of the 24th year. The address of this new building is the most square piece of land in Shanghai. Therefore, when constructing, the foundation of the new building (that is, the area of the foundation pit) was the largest. At the same time, in order to avoid the movement of the land, the project was done as quickly as possible, and it was completed in only one month. The backbone of the entire building (that is, steel and wood) are all foreign materials, and cement and bricks are domestic products. The entire project was completed very quickly. The preliminary project for each floor was completed in only eight days, and the construction cost a total of 1.5 million yuan. The entire construction of 'Da Sun' was built by adopting the typical style of large-scale department stores in Europe and the United States. The installation of things such as rolling doors, escalators, automatic elevators, and various counters has been carefully designed and built. When we enter other department stores, we only see twists and turns, and people's heads are moving, sometimes making it impossible for people to find what they want to buy; but in the new building of 'Da Sun', customers can see everything at a glance as soon as they enter each floor, and it is easy to find the categorized goods. At the same time, because the internal facilities are perfect, the light is sufficient and bright, and the air is well-regulated, it gives people a good impression, and it is generally recognized as the 'ideal department store.'" Because Mr. Jin was very busy with official duties, he stopped there and hurriedly shook hands with the reporter.</p>

<p>Among the large buildings in Shanghai that have recently been completed are the 22-story building of the Four Lines Savings Society on Jing'an Temple Road and the 9-story building of the Da Sun Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road. Both of these buildings are extremely majestic and magnificent. The internal and external stone materials, except for a small part of Italian marble, are all made of granite and Jade Buddha stone from the China Stone Company of Qingdao. What is most worthy of showing off in Shanghai is the outer wall of the ground floor, which is made of black labradorite, a special product of the Stone Company. This kind of stone material is only produced in Egypt besides my country's Shandong and Guizhou provinces. It also produces this kind of black labradorite. Its composition is mainly alkaline feldspar, amphibole feldspar, and hypersthene, which is obviously good and has no mica stone, so it is not afraid of the acidic effect of the hot sun and ice and frost. It is most suitable for use as an outer wall covering. Once polished, it is as bright as a mirror without the need to constantly wax it like foreign cloud stone, and it will not be peeled off by wind and frost after a long time. Therefore, recently, the special product of China Stone Company, black labradorite, has been sold to the Yangtze River area, such as the Bank of Communications in Nanjing, the Capital Hotel, the Dahua Grand Theater, the China Industrial Bank in Hankou, and the Meifeng Bank and Sichuan-Jian Bank in Chongqing, Sichuan. Overseas, places such as Java in Nanyang have successively ordered goods. At this time in our country, when legal currency is implemented and freight is inflated, among building materials, except for steel and hardware, there are no equivalent domestic products that can be used as substitutes. As for stone materials, due to the vastness of our country's land and the richness of its reserves, the China Stone Company collects a wide range of precious stones from famous mountains in various provinces, and processes and polishes them according to scientific methods. It must not allow Italian marble to monopolize the beauty of the past. It is hoped that the domestic construction industry will recover its rights in time and strive to promote it. Then the future of the Stone Company is still promising, and encourage it.</p>

<p>Otis Escalators and Elevators: Convenience for Customers, Novel Styles</p>
<p>The architecture of the Da Sun Company is magnificent. There are countless new facilities. Otis escalators are one of them. The reason why the company installed Otis escalators is that the company's department store has a variety of goods, and the location is very wide. Without this latest type of escalator, it is really not enough to meet the needs of customers. Moreover, after installing this escalator, the goods can also be sold quickly. The sales volume is large, and the selling price can also be indirectly reduced, so it can also benefit customers.</p>
<p>The company has a total of two Otis escalators. One is from the basement to the second floor, and the other is from the second floor to the third floor. The appearance is very beautiful. Both of these can go up or down at the same time. The speed of each chain is nearly 90 feet per minute. Therefore, it can provide 4,000 people to move up and down per hour. In terms of twelve hours a day, it can be used by 48,000 customers. When the company's business hours are about to end at night, the two escalators can go down at the same time. Customers do not have to wait. They can go down smoothly and do not have to take steps. The convenience and comfort can be imagined.</p>
<p>When customers purchase goods from the company, everything is convenient. Even the goods located on the second and third floors can be purchased as conveniently as on the first floor.</p>
<p>Not only that, the company is also equipped with the latest self-leveling Otis elevators, a total of six. Five are for passengers, and one is for transporting goods. This type of elevator is completely self-leveling. The reason is that ordinary elevators often do not level with the ground when they stop, and management is not easy. Drivers often have the disadvantage of slow operation. Now using Otis self-leveling elevators, customers can enter and exit conveniently. The management is also very flexible. Just press the button and you will immediately reach the designated location. At present, the lower floors are open first. In the future, all actions will be carried out, and there will be a single special express train that can directly go to the upper-level amusement park. The elevator is located at the entrance of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road. The interior is very spacious and can accommodate twenty-four people. The speed is four hundred feet per minute. There are two more elevators, installed at the rear of the company on Tibet Road and Lloyd Road, which can directly reach the roof garden.</p>
<p>The decoration and equipment of the five elevators are all of the latest styles. There are two elevators in the company's store that can automatically open the doors and use electricity, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>The elevator action signs outside the elevator doors on each floor are also very clear, which is very different from ordinary elevators. This type of elevator equipment is only available in the Shanghai Electric Power Company (two), the Continental Building (two), the International Hotel (three), and the Broadway Apartments (several). Other companies do not have this type of elevator. It can be seen that the company's equipment is exquisite and that Otis elevators are of excellent quality.</p>

<h3 id="e215">A General Overview of the Sincere Company <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>Its architecture, decor, equipment, and management are all exquisitely crafted. It is Shanghai's only modern and outstanding department store, striving to promote the sale of designed and improved goods for a way out.</p>
<p>The Sincere Company's new building, constructed over a year at a cost of over a million yuan, now stands majestically on the corner of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road. I, the writer, visited yesterday and was guided through the entire building by Mr. Liang of the company. I will now describe its general situation as follows.</p>
<p>History of Sincere: The Sincere Company was established by overseas Chinese from Australia, Mr. Cai Xing and Mr. Cai Chang, among others. In 1912, they gathered comrades and raised four million yuan to establish the Sincere Department Store in Hong Kong. Subsequently, in 1916, they established a branch in Guangzhou. Over the years, business has flourished and reputation has grown. Recognizing the importance of Shanghai's commercial position, they decided, after careful consideration, to build a large building and establish a company in Shanghai. Now, the new building has been completed and officially opened today. With the company's strong financial resources, outstanding reputation, and the founders' rich commercial experience and talent, it goes without saying that the Sincere Company's business will flourish day by day, with unlimited prospects. The new company has a capital of six million yuan. Mr. Hui Min, the manager of Sincere Hong Kong, has been transferred to serve as the manager. Mr. Cai Chang is the general supervisor.</p>
<p>Overview of the New Building: The Sincere Company's new building was constructed starting on November 19, 1934. It was designed by the Kee Yuen Engineering Firm and built by the Fook Kee Construction Company. From the start of construction to completion, it took thirteen months, with construction costs reaching over a million yuan. The new building has ten floors, from the basement to the roof, soaring into the sky and magnificent beyond compare. The entire building is based entirely on modern architectural principles, using the latest methods and specialized techniques, and constructed with the best materials. It is beautifully decorated and imposing. It has exhausted the possibilities of architectural aesthetics and artistry. Such a magnificent and grand department store building is not only unique in the country but also rare in Western countries. The new building is located at the corner of Nanjing Road, Tibet Road, and Lloyd Road, a prosperous location with wide streets. Customer parking is convenient. The richness of its interior decoration, the grandeur of its location, the ventilation, the brightness of the light, and other aspects are all outstanding and attractive. The ground floor has seven entrances, one of which leads directly to the rooftop amusement park, making it extremely convenient for both shoppers and general visitors to enter and exit.</p>
<p>Internal Layout: Five floors of the new building are used for the commercial area. The basement is used for storage, boiler rooms, the southern goods department, and the discount department, displaying various daily necessities throughout the year. The ground floor and the second and third floors display a wide range of goods, categorized and arranged in order. Departments such as fabrics and silks are located on the third floor, while departments such as clocks, toys, and furniture are located on the second floor. On the fourth floor, in addition to a portion of the area being used as an exhibition hall, the rest is used for accounting rooms, receiving rooms, and the general office. The fifth floor and above, up to the roof, are used as an amusement park. Currently, they are busy constructing stages and seats, hoping to complete them soon in order to attract various high-class entertainment performances to entertain visitors.</p>
<p>Various Facilities: The Sincere Company has all the latest facilities to enhance customer convenience and comfort. Among the most noteworthy are the hot and cold air ducts, the escalators that have never been seen in our country, and the uniquely designed special display cases. The hot and cold air ducts regulate the climate, making it warm as spring in winter and cool and breezy in summer, naturally making people feel happy. The escalators that quickly connect the ground floor and the second and third floors allow customers to ascend and descend easily by simply stepping onto the moving escalator steps, in addition to taking the three self-leveling elevators or the regular stairs. The escalators do not move too quickly, so while ascending and descending, one can look around and survey the entire area in order to select their favorite items. Each step is just large enough for one person to stand on, moving in sequence, making it a pleasant and comfortable experience without crowding. This is the special feature of the escalators. As for being absolutely safe and without danger, that goes without saying. The glass display cases for displaying goods, their installation method, and the corner seams are all designed and custom-made by the Sincere Company itself. They are very easy to install and remove and do not obstruct the view. All the goods in the display cases, whether they are in the corners of the cases or in the center, are clearly visible to customers from the outside.</p>
<p>Attentive Service: In order to ensure that customers receive maximum satisfaction and extreme comfort, the Sincere Company strives for perfection in terms of facilities and also pays great attention to service. All employees are trained to treat each customer with humility, enthusiasm, and sincerity, regardless of the size of the transaction.</p>
<p>Efforts to Promote Domestic Products: The Sincere Company's greatest goal is to promote domestic products and improve domestic production. Therefore, it not only adopts and promotes domestic products as much as possible, but also works with domestic manufacturers to research and improve them so that they can be sold effectively in the most modern and outstanding market, leading to increased production. With increased production and sales, industry and commerce will naturally flourish. This is of great benefit to society and the country. The Sincere Company is committed to this goal and is making every effort to achieve it. The various goods displayed in its various departments, such as silks, porcelain, and woodenware, are all domestic products. The beautiful and elegant new styles that make people reluctant to let go are all designed and custom-made by the Sincere Company. This shows its enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods. In terms of domestic goods, the Sincere Company's efforts go beyond this. In addition to collecting all kinds of domestic products, Sincere also procures the latest and best products from all over the world. This not only supplements the insufficient supply of domestic products but also serves as a model for imitation in order to manufacture high-quality domestic goods that are truly suitable for current needs.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Recent Situation of the Wah Hsin Brick &amp; Tile Company <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Wah Hsin Brick &amp; Tile Company has been established for over ten years. Its products, mainly large and small green and red flat tiles, have been sold in Shanghai and nearby ports and praised by the construction industry. Since Mr. Liu Zixian took over, the products have been greatly improved. In the past five or six years, the types have increased, including Spanish-style barrel tiles and Chinese temple-style barrel tiles, all of which are available. Two years ago, Mr. Liu saw that there was a great need for cement floor tiles (commonly known as patterned tiles) on the market, but most of the products were of poor quality and difficult to maintain. Those who tried them once regarded them as inferior products and rarely bought them again. He spent several months researching and realized that it was difficult to meet the market demand without improving the manufacturing process. Therefore, he purchased the latest machinery and adopted the latest methods to manufacture various colored cement floor tiles. Once they were launched, they spread like wildfire. In the past two years, many large and small buildings in the city and elsewhere have purchased them. Recently, the official residence of the President of the National Government in Nanjing, the Grand Hall of the National Government, the Party History Museum of the Central Party Headquarters, the Capital Hotel, the Jiangsu Bank, the Zhejiang Agricultural College in Hangzhou, the gymnasium of the Central Aviation School, the affiliated middle school of Soochow University in Huzhou, the office building of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in Nanchang, the Central Aviation Branch School, the Jiujiang Central Bank, the Haizhou Lianyungang Station Electric Factory, the Lagrene Children's Public School of the Shanghai French Municipal Council, the residence of Mr. Du Yuesheng, the residence of senior staff of the Bank of China, and the Sincere Company, which opened today, have all used Wah Hsin patterned floor tiles. There are countless other city houses and residences that have used them, which shows the excellent quality of the company's products.</p>
<p>Wah Hsin floor tiles are solid in texture, requiring a pressure of about 4,500 pounds per square inch. The colors are pure mineral and contain no impurities. The manufacturing method is novel, so the patterns are very clear, like paintings. The tile surface is smooth, not much less than glass. With these four advantages, it is appropriate that the construction industry regards it as a major innovation in cement floor tiles in the brick and tile industry today.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zixian, the manager and engineer of the company, studied in the United States and served as the chief engineer of the Taishan Brick &amp; Tile Company and the manager and engineer of the Southeast Brick &amp; Tile Company. He has excellent knowledge and rich experience and is a brick and tile expert. It is no accident that the company's products are excellent.</p>

<p>The magnetic face tiles used in the entire new Sincere Company building are produced by the New Machine Tile Factory on Zhoujiazui Road. These tiles are made entirely of Chinese clay. After applying oil to the tile surface, they are fired in one go, making them extremely strong, beautiful, and durable. They do not collect dust and are not easily damaged by wind, frost, rain, or snow. They are the most successful domestic product. Sincere Company decided to adopt them in large quantities first, which will greatly help the future development of purely domestic products.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Advantages of Datong Steel Windows <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Modern buildings mostly use steel doors and windows for their beautiful style, flexible opening and closing, no hiding of insects and ants, durability, ample light, and fire prevention. However, if the products are not from a manufacturer with established experience and outstanding achievements, they often have the disadvantages of not being tightly sealed, leaking wind and rain, and being frequently damaged. All the steel windows of the Sincere Company were contracted to the famous Datong Steel Window Company in Shanghai. They are beautiful and strong, different from other companies. This proves the Datong Steel Window Company's experience and achievements in the steel window business.</p>

<h3 id="e222">"Blacks and Chinese" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Simu</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin on December 16, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Liu Chongjie, lodged an informal protest with the German Propaganda Ministry, considering that Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" includes a chapter discussing "Blacks and Chinese" together, which made the Chinese feel embarrassed. This book, known as the bible of the National Socialist Party, has been published for many years and has been translated into Chinese. Ambassador Liu has also been in office for two years. It is not an appropriate time to raise the issue just before his departure, perhaps to fire a "parting shot".</p>
<p>However, our feelings are not like this. —</p>
<p>The racial fallacy was originally a pretext for imperialists to seize colonies. The National Socialist Party used it to shift the target of domestic people's struggle and strengthen Germany's reasons for demanding the restoration of the colonial empire. The political program of the National Socialist Party, the laws of its government (especially the recently promulgated anti-Jewish laws), and the speeches of Hitler, Goebbels, and other followers all prove that the National Socialist Party regards only the Aryan race as civilized people, and that Germans are the most excellent of the Aryan race. The so-called "Deutschland über Alles" has become a proud phrase in their party song. Since China, like Black Africa, has been a German colony, it is natural to discuss the "Blacks and Chinese" together because Chinese are also yellow-faced.</p>
<p>It is true that when China and Germany exchange ambassadors and try their best to get along with each other in other aspects, such a chapter is still retained in the famous works of the German leader, which has been reprinted countless times, which does indeed violate the purpose of friendly relations. No wonder that as soon as Ambassador Liu raised the issue, Mr. Fink, the acting Minister of Propaganda, "apologetically" agreed to cancel or revise it when the next edition is published. However, not to mention that "diplomatic rhetoric" and imperialist colonial policies can go hand in hand, even if this "bible" no longer contains anything that damages the dignity of the Chinese people in the future, will China's international status be enhanced from then on? Will the "Third Reich" no longer treat China as Black Africa, but desire to give it a try? This is still a big question.</p>
<p>It should be known that Germany, which emerged from defeat in the European War, has never forgotten China. Speaking of Qingdao, many Germans still have regrets and are salivating. Not to mention the National Socialist Party, which openly demands colonies. Although Sino-German relations are indeed friendly, Japanese-German relations are even more friendly. The widespread rumors in the newspapers about the secret German-Japanese agreement and the pro-Japanese arguments of the National Socialist Party's organ when Sino-Japanese disputes occurred prove what Germany's wooing of China is all about at heart.</p>
<p>If, because of the discussion of "Blacks and Chinese" together, it is pointed out as an insult, it is implying that oneself also recognizes Blacks as born inferior and should not be associated with the glorious Chinese nation with 5,000 years of culture. The current China, which calls for uniting the world's small and weak nations, does not seem to hold this racial fallacy with the taste of imperialists.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Finally, in fact, the status of Chinese in foreign societies is not necessarily higher than that of Blacks. North America has special areas where Blacks gather, the ghetto, and San Francisco and London also have Chinatowns. Blacks are the source of ridicule and insult in American films. The pigtails and opium pipes of Chinamen are also malicious embellishments in American and even German Ufa films. Moreover, in the previous election in the United States, one of the presidential candidates was Black. Recently, Abyssinia, a Black country, desperately resisted the Italian invasion and did not accept the mediation plan of the imperialists, which is better than China. This is a fact that we all know and recognize. As a joke, some concession parks in China used to have signs saying "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed in," but in the eyes of some imperialists, Chinese are treated the same as dogs.</p>
<p>However, we are not saying that China should accept insults from imperialists submissively. On the contrary, China has many reasons to protest against discriminatory measures and remarks against Chinese by foreign countries. Not to mention the anti-Chinese laws in Nanyang and the Americas, even the fact that Hungary does not allow Chinese to enter the country and that Germany persecutes and even imprisons small businessmen from Qingtian, Zhejiang, should also be protested. As for greater oppression and aggression, it goes without saying that we should resist to the death like Abyssinia, a Black country.</p>
<p>The current protest, however, originates from the prejudice of being ashamed to be associated with Blacks, which not only exposes the spirit of Ah Q, but is also somewhat inappropriate in its wording.</p>

<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>I arrived in Old Fuman Village around the New Year. The village was filled with revelry, and the carnival was about to begin. All of Manila was busy selecting the Carnival Queen. This village, like Manila, had a small street. Next door to us was a grocery store opened by an old councilor who had retired in 1925. The old councilor had gone blind and sat in the store all year round, leaning on a cane and loudly telling customers about his glorious past. The councilor's wife was still a middle-aged woman of about thirty-five or six, with two daughters in their late teens. These two modern sisters took out an old phonograph from the counter on Christmas Day and locked themselves in the house all day long, playing it loudly, singing and dancing wildly to the lewd songs, to the point that the whole village could hear.</p>
<p>The old councilor sat in his round chair, listening distractedly, his blind eyeballs covered with a white film twitching, a smile on his lips, tapping his cane lightly on the ground in time with the music. The councilor's wife also seemed very excited, darting nervously around the narrow store filled with cabinets, while the farmers, women, and children crowded outside the store, staring with their mouths open, listening distractedly. Several people who had run out of the wine shop, limping and stumbling, also hummed along in a low, hoarse voice, and danced in the street.</p>
<p>Finally, Songkui, the village police chief, also came. He slowly stepped down the street with a brisk pace. His neatly pressed yellow uniform shone slightly in the soft sunlight.</p>
<p>People busily made way for him, and he ran inside. He greeted the councilor's wife respectfully and asked the old councilor how he was. The old councilor trembled excitedly and shouted, "Old friend, it's been a long time! How have you been? Busy with work?" He pushed his cane away, stood up from the round chair, took a step forward, and opened his arms. Police Chief Songkui threw himself into his arms, and they hugged each other. After a while, the phonograph suddenly stopped. The two sisters heard it from the room and thought that a distinguished guest had arrived, so they opened the door half-naked. When they saw that it was Uncle Songkui, they looked displeased and ran back inside, pouting as if they were angry at someone. Finally, even the audience outside the store gradually dispersed, and the small street became quiet and solemn again.</p>
<p>The councilor's wife also took the time to go into the house, leaving the old councilor to watch the store. The old councilor smiled kindly and pulled the police chief close, asking, "Old friend, why haven't you been here lately? Really, God is my witness, I'm thinking of you all the time! I often think to myself and ask Rosa's mother, 'Why hasn't Uncle Songkui been here lately? Is it because we were slow to entertain him and he's angry?' She would say, 'Uncle Songkui is not that kind of person, he wouldn't blame us. He's probably busy with work and can't spare the time!' Really, old friend, you're too busy..."</p>
<p>"I'm not busy, but I've been running around lately for a robbery case..." Police Chief Songkui replied coldly.</p>
<p>"A robbery case? Which village again?" the old councilor asked in surprise, his blind eyes twitching nervously.</p>
<p>"It happened to a truck carrying goods from Manila in the Kepu forest area."</p>
<p>"So, any clues?"</p>
<p>"Several suspects have been arrested. Ke Tai from the village won't be able to escape!"</p>
<p>At this time, a heavy voice shouted loudly in the street. A heavily loaded carriage passed by, which excited the old councilor and reminded him of the Carnival that was raging in Manila. He inquired with Police Chief Songkui and sighed softly:</p>
<p>"Times have changed, alas! Uncle Songkui, when I think back to my time in the council, how excited we would be during such auspicious days! At that time, we had our own landau, the most respectable carriage you could find anywhere in Manila. On Christmas night, on the festive New Year's Eve, and even when the Carnival came, we would wear gorgeous clothes, and the Rosa sisters, when they were still young, would sit on either side of us. The coachman, Fu Jin, this little black fellow, sat solemnly on the driver's seat and turned around to ask, 'Sir, where to?' Then I would shout loudly, 'Isn't it the same as every year, to Manila, you blockhead!' Then he would turn around, whistling softly, the long whip flying in the air, and the horse would start walking. At this time, when we looked out of the car window, we often saw people crowded at the entrance of the village, watching us with envious eyes and waving their hands at us.</p>
<p>"But times have changed. The unfortunate have replaced the happy. Because of my unfortunate eyes, I was dismissed from my position as a councilor, and life has become more difficult day by day. First, we sold our villa on the Lunli Dai beach, and then even the chestnut mare and the landau were sold. At this time, I became so old! I will never see that respectable landau again, and Fu Jin's aggrieved face when he was scolded. The people who crowded at the entrance of the village watching us with envious eyes and waving their hands at us have also been replaced by new masters... Old friend, think about these lost days, how wonderful it is to think about them now!...</p>
<p>The old councilor said sadly. When Police Chief Songkui looked up, he also saw that the blind eyes of this unfortunate old friend were filled with teardrops the size of beans. (Manila Story, Part Two)</p>
<h3 id="e224">Chasing Rabbits <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>——A Small Scene in the Mountains and Fields of Qidong——</p>
<p>——Let's go! Let's chase rabbits! Let's chase rabbits!</p>
<p>Liu Shuangxi carried a large bundle of rabbit nets on his back, holding a lukewarm sweet potato in his right hand, eating as he walked. After swallowing a mouthful, he would take a moment to shout twice. When he reached Yu Qi's doorway, he stopped, threw away the sweet potato peel, and shouted again.</p>
<p>The snow had stopped long ago, and everyone had just finished breakfast. Some were mixing grass for the livestock in the pen, while others were squatting on the steps at the entrance smoking. The young people were overjoyed to hear someone calling to chase rabbits. They hurriedly put on their pigskin leggings, found their rabbit nets, grabbed a stick from the courtyard, and ran into the street.</p>
<p>In a short while, many people gathered at Yu Qi's doorway, carrying nets and pulling sticks.</p>
<p>They followed the willow trees along the riverbank at the edge of the village, diagonally crossing the frozen river, heading towards Tianzi Ridge. The distant mountains were covered in dazzling white, the fields were dazzling white, and the diagonal valleys were dazzling white. Everyone was talking, laughing, arguing, and making noise, like a swarm of flies landing on white granulated sugar, buzzing incessantly. The snow crunched under their feet, and the tobacco in their pipes mixed with their exhaled breath, slowly disappearing into the cold.</p>
<p>Passing through the deep valley, the pine forest appeared before them. The snow pressed down on the pine branches, and the half-dead pine needles quietly hid under the branches, looking up at the snow blossoms above. The smooth, bare oak trees had branches that seemed to be wrapped in a layer of soft cotton. There was no storm, no dark clouds, and the sunlight fell on the snow, reflecting a glistening shine.</p>
<p>When they reached the foot of Tianzi Ridge, they stopped.</p>
<p>Everyone argued and yielded in disorder. Some said they should set up the nets here, while others said this place was not as good as the slope on the east side. They argued back and forth for a long time. Then Yu Qi spoke up, saying that according to his experience, this was an excellent place. No one insisted, so they began to set up the nets. Liu Shuangxi and Xiao Shunzi hid under the short pine branches at the end of the net, stabilizing their bodies. The rest of the people pulled their sticks and ran off in all directions, the mountain filled with shouts. Sticks beat against the pine trees, and the peaceful snow was trampled on.</p>
<p>The rabbit is the most alert and timid of animals. It silently hides under a small bush close to the ground, shrinking its body and fighting the cold. When it hears human voices shouting, it runs off in a panic. It runs east and encounters shouts, then turns back and runs west, but the shouts are just as loud there. It then cleverly runs in the direction where there are no shouts. Suddenly, the sound waves behind it rise higher, chasing after it. It uses its last bit of strength and runs forward recklessly. Just when it thinks it has escaped with its life, it runs into the net and is held down by someone.</p>
<p>——Nine in total!—— Yu Qi happily tied the rabbit's hind legs together, a clear drip of snot hanging from his nose.</p>
<p>Then everyone gathered again, packing up the nets, tying the straps, smoking, blowing their noses, and coughing. When they put the nets on their shoulders, someone suggested going to Huangniu Mountain for another round. But everyone was already tired, and no one wanted to expend their last bit of energy under this cold, fierce assault.</p>
<p>The crowd wriggled across the snow, passed through the pine forest, and crossed the deep valley. Talking and laughing made them forget their fatigue.</p>
<p>On the way home, the sun pointed directly south, and the smoke from the village chimneys appeared in a deep gray color in the cold air. Hunger stirred in the crowd.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Anniversary of Death <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>On the anniversary of my maternal uncle's death, I arrived from the station with a sorrowful heart and took a car directly to my uncle's house. My uncle's family used to be a prominent clan in the county. Although it was not as prosperous as before during my uncle's time, the large five-courtyard residence still stood proudly, and the Protector Village Bridge was always renovated to look new. The car stopped by the Protector Village River, and I could see the white paper streamers on the two door panels fluttering in the cold wind from afar. I strolled across the Protector Village Bridge. The path in front of the village was covered with newly fallen dead leaves, as if no one had walked here this morning. Approaching the gate, the door panels were ajar. I walked straight into the third courtyard, which was the main hall. The elegiac couplets and banners hanging on the four walls were faded. I stood there blankly, thinking of my uncle's life. In just one year, everything had died with my uncle's death! Entering the side courtyard, the old maid cried out as if she had found a treasure, "Young nephew is here!"</p>
<p>She told me that my aunt was bedridden upstairs and had not gotten up for two months. The young master didn't care about anything and stretched out his hand to ask his mother for money every day. The old maid shed two clear tears and led me upstairs. My aunt seemed to have heard my voice long ago, propped herself up halfway, and waited for me. She beckoned me to sit in front of her bed, and like when I was a child, she reached out to touch my cheek as soon as she saw me, and said in a trembling voice, "You still remember your uncle's anniversary."</p>
<p>I had learned some things about my uncle's family over the past year from people from my hometown. My uncle liked to do good deeds during his lifetime, and the loans he made to others were all without contracts. But when he had financial difficulties, he would rather take out loans. After my uncle died, my aunt sold the fields to repay them. As for the money loaned to others, it naturally disappeared without a trace. My cousin was also unproductive, but contrary to expectations, my uncle's family did not fall to such a miserable state. On the anniversary of my uncle's death, not a single relative or friend came to mourn! I lowered my head, not daring to look directly at my aunt. I secretly looked at her thin wrist. I regretted making this trip, because my coming from afar might have made my aunt even more sad!</p>
<p>The old maid was an old servant in my uncle's family. Perhaps she also had a bellyful of grievances to tell me, and she often cast glances at me; but my aunt, the mistress, did not speak. After a while, she said, "Young nephew, talk to the mistress, I'll go downstairs to brew tea."</p>
<p>My aunt then sighed.</p>
<p>"Thanks to her, I didn't die of illness! I don't know what sins I committed to leave behind this treasure. Your uncle did good deeds all his life, only to end up like this. What else is there to say!" My aunt seemed a little more excited and reached out her trembling hand again to stroke my hair. "You don't know yet, do you? After your uncle died, people came to the door to collect debts almost every day. I never participated in the income and expenditure of money. Your uncle was frugal, and until his death, he pretended not to be sick, because he couldn't bear to call a doctor! Look, after he died, what did it become! That treasure only knows how to reach out his hand for money. I've been sick for more than two months, and he doesn't know to call a doctor. When he comes to my room, it's only to ask for money. It's not like before now, and people are so bad. Where did your uncle mistreat people? Not a single soul came to the door on his first anniversary. Just think, this family's fortune was not easily earned!"</p>
<p>My aunt's voice rose higher and higher. The grievances accumulated in her heart seemed to be vented in this opportunity, and the hand stroking my hair tightened, as if she wanted to grab something to vent her anger. I held back my tears,</p>
