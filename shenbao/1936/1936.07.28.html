<p>— 禹</p>
<p>據昨日天津電訊。日鐘紡會社决以高價收買津市華新紗廠。而津市寳成紗廠賣與日商裕太。設為分廠。殆亦無挽回希望查。天津華商自辦之六大紗廠。其中裕大。裕元。北洋早入日人掌握。今華新竇成又復出售。則碩果僅存者。唯中國。中南。鹽業。金城四行合組誠孚公司所經營之恒裕一家而已。日商在華所設紗廠為數已多。今復不惜巨資。兼併華商各廠。其用意所在。顯欲壟斷全中國之紗業。蓋日商在紗廠業方面現正積極從事於新廠之增設。與錠機之添置。在鐘紡。大日本紡。金籐紡。東洋紡等各會社互相合作之下。津市之日商紗錠數。擬於一年內增添六十萬枚。同時上海方面日華。公大。豐田。上海各廠。亦已决定增錠十五萬枚。預計不久以後。在華日本資本之紗錠數。至少當達三百萬枚以上。（現的二百四十五萬枚）視華商自有之總錠數。超過甚多。據上月統計。華商紗廠錠數。全國合計不過二百七十餘萬枚。尙須除去新近出售各廠的十數萬枚。曁無數停工减工之空錠。錠數旣見减退。技術又復落後。尙何發展之可言。日紗在我國市塲上蓋已自得佔有壓倒的勢力矣。</p>
<p>抑日商不僅謀紗廠業本身之發展已也。彼等為擴充棉紗銷路計。並在我國致力於棉布之生產。今春三月間僅浦東日華紡織工塲一家之布機。卽已自七百三十六架一躍而為一千四百三十六架。增至一倍左右。同時日商對於原棉之壟斷。亦不遺餘力。在所謂「經濟提携」「經濟合作」曁「工業日本農業中國」之口號下。華北棉花早被劃入日方原料預算之內。滿鐵鐘紡東洋舫等擴大棉區與改良種籽計畫。現方着着進行。預期在不久之將來。可有甚大之收穫。日本原棉之供給。本多仰給於美國印度與埃及。設華北植棉計畫全部告成。則此一重大之原料問題。卽可就近獲得充分解决矣。</p>
<p>就上以觀。我國紗布之產銷。棉花之供求。勢將盡受日商有計畫的操縱。設不及早挽救。則中國棉紡織業之總崩潰。可立而待。紡織業為中國僅有的民族工業之主力。此而崩潰。則整個國民經濟之基礎。殆亦難免於動搖矣。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一藏</p>
<p>（七）大阪市聽</p>
<p>次如早晨，我們到大阪市廳（市役所）去參觀。市廳在中之島大江橋畔，是一所富麗堂皇的六層大厦。門額上的市徽好像「不」字，據說就是從前做着航海標識的浮標的簡形。廳內紙織分為一局（電氣）九部（土木，保健，港灣，敎育，產業，庶務，水道，社會，監查）二課，（秘書，會計），由三助役帮同市長統轄着。市長是市議會所選舉，助役連同掌管財政出納的收入役和副收入役是市長所推薦而山市議會通過的。現任大阪市長名呌加加英武夫。</p>
<p>上了宏麗的大理石的大樓梯，向一個十六七歲的學生裝的給仕遞了名片。于是大阪市長派了書記的場三郞，在樓的應接室接見我們。的場君答覆了許多問話，患贈了幾種印刷品，還陪了我們上五樓。在近百的男女職員坐着繪　，　算，打字抄寫的廣間里，他介紹？土本部庶務係長平河漾一跟我們談話。從兩君的談話上，我們略知大阪市最近的建設狀况如下：</p>
<p>「大阪市一九二零年所决定的都布計畫經過了幾决的修正和補充，已經全部實施了。現在正進行淸第二次都市計畫的工程。都市計畫所包括的地域，現在的大阪市及其附近十一個盯村總計面積二百二十七方公里，其中住居地域的占三成，商業地域的占一成四，工業地域的占三成七分六，未指定地域的占一成八。全市街道現有九千五百條。最出色的林蔭大道御堂筋今年可以全部完工了。這條大道從大阪車站直通到難波，闊四十四公尺，種有樹木四列，劃分走路，高速車路和低速車路下面還築有地下鐵道，行駛着高速電車。這眞是現代都市的模範路。關于街道兩旁的建築物在都市計畫上也有改善的辦法。大概市內的樞要部分指定為防火地區，所有的建築物，都須構造得有防火防震的作用。近郊的山林地帶指定為風致地區，力求自然美的保存。商業繁盛的地帶指定為美觀地區，力求建築物的整齊和美觀。至于市內的橋梁，的計一千三百餘座，防火防震的建築居多。可是木造的也還不少，現正一一預備着拆造。</p>
<p>一都市計畫以外，最可注意的建設工程就是築港。大阪的初期築港工程，費了一萬萬圓日金，在一九二九年就大體完成了。第二期築港工程正在進行着。防波堤共長九千四百公尺，港內面積六百五十五萬方公尺，可以停泊一萬噸以上的輪船。這幾年大阪的港務發展得很快，因此大阪港的國外輸出貿易已經超過橫濱港了。」</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（四）蛋之稅率　蛋類</p>
<p>稅率在前頗低，民二十年財政部改訂稅率，為從價百分之七，五，較前增加一二倍不等。旋政府體恤商艱，於廿二年五月廿五日改為從價百分之五，皮蛋鹹蛋千只收國幣五角。廿四年六月，出口稅率再度减至半數，惟以財政困難，雖經正式公布，實際尙未施行。今將最近海關對於蛋之估價列下，（稅率從價百分之五）：</p>
<p>各國對於蛋品高築關稅壁壘，美國進口稅在値百抽百以上，乾蛋每磅須納稅二角七分，德國於民二十一年施行新稅則，計冰全蛋冰蛋黃每百斤徵六十五馬克，的合從價百分之九十，鮮蛋每百公斤自原微五馬克加至七十馬克，的合値百抽百，法國於本年五月十五日忽减低蛋類特許稅，如蛋白蛋黃每百凈基羅原微二八〇，現微一五〇……英國現行稅率，特列表如左：</p>
<p>帶壳蛋</p>
<p>（一）每十打重量不超過十四磅　課稅一先令</p>
<p>（二）每十打重量超過十四磅但不逾十七磅課稅一先令六辦士</p>
<p>（三）每十打重量在十七磅以上　課稅一先令九辦士去壳蛋（每磅為單位）</p>
<p>（一）液體或冰凍者（連蜜在內全黃或全白）課稅一　辦士</p>
<p>（二）乾全蛋　課稅　2　辦士</p>
<p>（三）蛋黃　課稅　1　辦士</p>
<p>（四）乾蛋白　課稅　2　辦士</p>
<p>（五）出口情形蛋之銷路除供國內食用外大部運銷各國已有六十年之歷史，最初僅限於鮮蛋一種，專銷日本，每年出口在十萬海關兩以下，自蛋製品盛行以後，出口數量逐年增加，迨冰蛋崛起，鮮蛋，蛋製品銷路遂現不振，此可從二十四年度輸出種類之狀况窺見其大概：</p>
<p>蛋類輸出目的地以英國為第一，美决之，德又决之，日本自提倡養鷄以後，入超轉為出超，民十七年上海日商三井洋行述到日本蛋樣百餘箱，反向華商蛋廠兜銷，丹麥，波蘭產蛋極夥，為我國海外市塲唯一之勁敵，英屬各殖民地亦多蛋產，因此英國對於我國蛋銷活躍，頗有戒心，竭力宣傳我國蛋產品質之欠佳，要求政府加征重稅或禁止進口，德國實行經濟統制，美國施行加稅，抵制華蛋，已收效果，茲將二十四年度輸出數各國比</p>
<p>蛋之出口市塲前以天津為重心，今以上海為樞紐，前分析二十四年度輸出地數量比率如下：</p>

<p>昨天（二日）下午四時、籃球隊與新加坡的聯隊、作了一度非正式的友誼賽、本來我們的選手經過六七天航海的生活、精神身體都十分疲倦、有幾位簡直連飯都沒有吃、絕對不能舉行比賽的、但是新加坡的僑胞、都很熟烈的希望能作一次友誼比賽、他們早就把各隊的好手集合起來、加以訓練、並且沒有微求我們的同意、就發售門票（每人五角的合國幣一元）、從馬來亞半島各埠來看這幕比賽的人很多、郵船靠停後、各團體的代表、就要求於公宴後比賽、大家把責任都推到董守義敎練的身上、董敎練沒有辦法、祇好答應下來、三點半鐘大世界內的籃球塲上、已是人山人海、國術隊先行表演、節目十分精彩、博得僑胞的掌聲不少、三時三刻、選手隊登塲、舒動筋骨、先分兩隊表演六分鐘、甲隊是王玉增·牟作雲·王鴻斌·李紹康·王南珍、乙隊是劉齊成·馮念華·徐兆熊·劉雲章·蔡演雄、結果八對二、甲隊勝、四時正、選手隊與新聯隊列陣作戰、選手隊以最精銳的甲隊出塲、三個前錄、出沒敵陣、如入無人之境、不到兩分鐘、就打進四球、選手隊得十二分時、新聯才射進一球、表演的精彩、使僑胞看得目瞪口呆、以後選手隊輪流更換隊員、精神不像開始時那樣興奮、客客氣氣的讓新聯隊慢慢追上去、不停的打了三十分鍊、選手隊以二十八比二十五小勝、大家急急忙回船、於僑胞熱烈歡送聲中離別新加坡、（七月三日紀）</p>
<p>（二）（十）航行印度洋中</p>
<p>郵船離了新加坡、在麻刺甲海峽中前進、正是廢厲月中的夜晚、一輪明月、照耀天空、遇着浮雲像箭一般的長馳、平靜的海面上、反映着一條銀光、使人看了、引起一種說不出的美感、我們在甲板上躺在籐椅上、陶醉在大自然的懷抱裏、眞是心曠神怡、大有飄飄欲仙之槪、</p>
<p>第二天早上、太陽又湧現出來、麻刺甲海峽兩岸、林木葱翠、景色十分美麗、大家對這樣的海行生活、感覺很舒適、十點鐘、討論委員會請黃麗明女士在二等艙吸烟室演講歐洲的禮儀、去　講的人很多、</p>
<p>傍晚的時候、郵船已穿過麻刺甲海峽、航行到印度洋中、這以風在浪大著稱的印度洋、雖未顯出牠最兇惡的姿態、可是船身已是一上一下的盪動、遠不如在麻刺甲海峽中航行時的舒適平穩、怕暈船的人、都躱到船艙中躺着、晚餐時餐室中空了許多座位、九點鐘、遊藝委員會在頭等甲板上舉行一個遊藝大會、所有輪中中西旅客、都邀請參加、一共到了三百人、沈嗣良主席、唱黨歌致開會詞後、邀請船長作了一個簡短的演說、然後遊藝節目隨之開始、先由王懷琪江振德合作表演一幕矮子演講、决為國術表演、雖因艙矮室小、船身震盪、未能大展身手、但是每一節目、表演都十分精彩、博得掌聲雷動、尤其是許多外國旅客、更為稱讚不置、瞿漣沅和鄭懷賢表演一幕對打、結果瞿女士的兩肘靑腫了好幾塊、鄭力士也有幾塊紅印、可見他們表演的認眞、昨今兩天（四日五日）、風浪益發凶惡起來、一起一伏的浪峯、泛出乳白色的水沫、銜擊着船身的時候、水花濺起一兩丈高、海風發出虎嘯似的吼聲、令人心悸、船身一上一下一左一右、好像很有節奏似的盪動着、搖得很多人頭暈目眩、吃飯時人數更形减少、就是能支持着走到餐室去、也不過應到畫卯、與我同室同桌的中央日報的儲安平君、在床上躺了兩天、不能離床一步、有兼人之量的國際攝影社羅穀蓀君、對着菜也祇有搖頭嘆息、</p>
<p>今天（五日）早上十點鐘、同舟聯誼會在二等吸烟室舉行第一次大會、參加的人以郵船上的同胞為限、因為風浪太大、到的人祇七八十人、沈嗣良主席、致詞後、聯誼會會長江庸及駐德副武官潘華國相繼致詞、然後每一個人都自己通名報姓、以示介紹、中國旅行社隨輪幹事鄧炳鈴、亦備茶點招待、盡歡而散、預定在離船之前、再舉行一次大會、也許那時可以有多一點人參加、</p>
<p>象棋錦標賽、已到决賽階段、奪得决賽權的、是錢一勤、吳德懋、錢吳兩君、眞是棋逢敵手、鏖戰數局、不分勝負、結、果還有平分錦標、結束比賽、、記者第一週就遇到健將錢君、敗下陣來、但是局勢的緊張、雖决賽週也不能相比、記者在一勝一負之後、才始「吃　」、差堪自慰、</p>
<p>郵船預定明天（六日）下午一時、可到錫蘭的首區哥倫坡、又將完成一五七六海里的航程、大概有六七小時的停留、大家都希望時間能快點過去、也許疲倦極了的精神身體、那時可多少恢復過來、（七月五日記六日寄自哥倫坡）（完</p>

<h3 id="c200">江蘇省會兒童矯治扁桃腺疾患槪况 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>—江蘇省會衛生敎育委員會工作之一—</p>
<p>學校衛生在今日之重視，已成為當前衛生界與敎育界牢不可破的事實。因為學校生活，為人生必走之階段，少則數年，多至二三十寒暑，人類的智慧與技能，差不多皆由學校中培養成功，但我們僅注意兒童學識方面的灌輸，而不顧其體格健康的豭鍊，衛生習慣的養成，結果兒童是體虛質弱，身心不全，以致易為疾病纏綿，災害流連，敎學之效率，在無形中而低弱，而减退，所以學校衛生之推動，實有急圖發達之必要。例如體格之檢查，缺患之矯正，疾病之診治與預防，健康之敎學以及環境衛生之設備，這皆為學校衛生之工作。</p>
<p>矯治缺患，為學校衛生最重要工作之一，凡身體經健康檢查時，給吾們所發現各項危害身體健康之疾患，必須予以正當之矯治，使其回復正常之狀態，在各缺患項目中，以患砂眼，齲齒，扁桃腺佔最多數，矯洽砂眼耳病牙病，尙可在學校中勉力從事，惟欲矯治扁桃腺，則難矣哉，蓋扁桃腺矯治之方法，必須行外科手術，時日之延需，而有設備完善醫院方可施行，但在一般兒童家長醫藥智識欠缺之時，未能詳知扁桃腺腫大之弊害，一言割治，則立予拒絕，故全國舉辦扁桃腺矯治，僅見南京上海北平等三處，其受矯治者，亦屬渺渺無幾，由此可知矯治扁桃腺，為實施學校衛生之一大困難問題。</p>
<p>江蘇省會衛生敎育委員會成立甫經二月，就省會七小學校，學生二八〇○人，健康檢查結果，扁桃腺腫大者，約佔受檢查學生百分之二〇·七一·，此種缺點如不矯治，長此以往，殊非保障兒童健康之道，二十四年十二月本會議决利用寒假時期，作扁桃腺矯治之工作，嗣得鎭江基督醫院之協助，允於特闢病室及種種優待辦法，本會扁桃腺割除，於斯見諸事實矣。</p>
<p>一　扁桃腺矯治預定辦法大綱</p>
<p>一·公開演講　利用每星期各校紀念週時間，由本會派醫師衛生指導員護士，分赴各校演講扁桃腺之危害及其矯治方法，俾學生明瞭，樂於割除。</p>
<p>二·印發說明書　由本會編扁桃腺腫大說明書分發各梭，凡息扁桃腺腫之學生，每人一張，並由校長飭令該生帶交家長閱讀，俾於施行割除時期，可得家長之諒解與同情而樂予協助。</p>
<p>三·課室講授　以扁桃腺作一大單元中心之敎材，俾學生對於扁桃腺有深切之認識。</p>
<p>四·安排學生　由各校將患扁桃腺腫大之學生姓名，編列成表，再由本會醫師予以復查，凡應立卽矯治之扁桃腺腫大學生均查明住址列入一表，以便着手進行勸導割治。</p>
<p>五·家長談話會　由各校召集患扁桃腺學生之家長，並由本會主任醫師護士和家長作個別談話，解釋扁桃腺腫大之危害及簡易矯治方，俾各家長對其有深切之了解，而願其兒童得受扁桃腺矯治。</p>
<p>六·家庭訪視　分派護士親至各該生家庭訪視，並切實予以勸導講述，俟得家長同意後卽請其簽名蓋章，同時並詳細指示各家長屆時頒導學生入住基督醫院之掛號，診查住院繳費等手續。</p>
<p>七·接洽醫院　由本會與鎮江基督醫院商洽之，關於一切掛號門診住院及繳費優待辦法等，訂定細目，以便施行。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c201">辦理農村衛生之困難及解决方針（二） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 劉昉農</p>
<p>（七）人民四散居住：在鄉間大的村莊不過百餘家，小的僅有十餘家，或獨家村的，每村相距至少里許；有時侯村莊雖多，而人口不衆，據過去經騐：六千人口的地方，經過兩三年的宣傳，農民還不能認識醫藥與衛生的重要。</p>
<p>（八）工作人員不知農民心理和農村概况：有許多醫生護士初到農村服務，不知道鄕村組織和人民心理，不詳細了解農村衛生是什麼；以為醫院的經騐就是衛生，不知用那種方法去推進衛生事業，不知道治療不過為預防的入手之處，所以對於工作不發生興趣與效力。</p>
<p>（九）農村中多江湖醫士之流：這些醫士，往往勸人家包醫，其所用的藥，大都是些昇藥降藥等覇道之藥類，可以使其暫時减輕，或用對症下藥的方法，敷衍了事，等到病再復發的時候，或加重的時候，他錢旣到手，一切都不負責任而逃之大吉了，因此農民蒙其流毒，以為包治醫生，方可盡心診治，多用好藥，這都是一般人的錯誤觀念；所謂醫生有悲天憫人的慈善心腸，豈有不悉心診治之理，而且新醫素無包治之例，包治又為法律所禁止的呢？加之農民性多頑劣，因包治而與江湖醫生糾葛者，吾人屢見不鮮，誠為前途一大阻碍也。</p>
<p>（十）治療困難：辦理農村衛生，旣以治療為入手處，但是因為一般農民知識簡陋。對於醫藥知識，敢說是一點不知道，因此來就診者，便問是何疾病，明日怎樣，後日又怎樣，幾日就能够痊愈，這一類的話，就是經騐再豐富的醫生也不能卽時的解答吧？而且有許多病的診斷，又非一二日所能知道的。倘使你說明日怎樣，後日又怎樣；沒到明日不能相符，則將又受責問，而且你若常時不給他答覆，則每多懷疑，倘一二藥劑不見大效，則將又另請高明，江湖醫生乘機飽囊輾轉再三，病入危險時期，往往成不治症者，為吾人耳目常見的事實也。</p>
<p>（十一）一般農民醉心在藥劑萬能，醫學萬能，反把最緊要的自然療法忽略過去，例如肺癆，在現在的時代，尙無治療的特效藥，靠現在所知道藥物是不能治愈肺癆的；最要緊的是安靜，能修養多得新鮮的空氣和日光，倘使你把這一類的攝生方法吿訴他們，設能接受了，因短時間內未能得到顯著的成效，因而恢心，或因工作關係，在時間上不能允許，不能繼續實行，因此，不能明暸自然療法的價值，反以為靠安靜修養是不能療病的，每把治愈的時期輕輕放過，一味倚賴藥劑萬能，醫學萬能，請求服藥，徒然將胃腸成了自然的藥庫，若不把這種迷夢打破，忘却自然療法，單靠吃藥想把肺病治好，這是極大的錯誤；不獨肺癆為然，事實上有很多的疾病，也是要注意自然療法的，藥劑不過是自療的下策罷了。</p>
<p>（十二）其他，如新醫（科學醫）精外科，中醫精內科，這類荒謬的言語，早在農民的腦海中有了深刻的印像，這也是農民的一點錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>以上共十二點是作者所經歷的事實以下再將其補救方針略述一二，以備辦理農村衛生的同志，作一參考</p>
<p>（一）普及敎育：「普及敎育」差不多自從九一八以來，所最倡行的言論；雖然近來都市上，已有了民衆學校，識字强迫班等等的設施；但是農村文盲之多，有足驚人的統計，然而農民田賦的敎育費是完了，非但高等敎育，中等敎育，無從入門；就連初等敎育，也沒享受的機會。人民知識不開，衛生事業，固然不易推行；就是目前禁政的厲行，也因了人民智識太淺，「頑忽政令」，「視同具文」，亦所在多有。前幾日敎部有遍設鄕村學校的命令，我們聆悉之餘，不勝愉快，極願當局，能於早日實現，敎育普及了，才是我們民族復興，國家强盛的預兆呢！</p>
<p>自華北救亡運動以後有所謂：「國難敎育」，當此全國敎育課本從新整頓的時機，希望我們敎育界領袖，可將衛生一科，列為基本的科門，因為衛生敎育，是有關民族生存的重要敎育；可以儘量的採用淺近的文字，把疾病的原因，疾病的預防，個人衛生，公共衛生，新醫藥的利益，急救的療法，問神求卜的不可靠的一些學識，來灌輸給學生，使他們在幼小的時候，便種下了簡單醫藥衛生的基本知識；及至農村衛生事業發達，農村衛生人員來指導的時候，他們就很容易接受，如家庭訪視，保嬰運動，婦幼檢查，生產率死亡率的調查，環境衛生等工作，就不會再吃閉門羹，或嚴詞拒絕的侮辱了；而且他們還能够帮助能力所不及的地方。</p>
<p>（二）經濟來源：經營一種事業，當然以金錢的有無為先决的條件；有了錢，什麼事都可以辦到，這是無疑一定的道理，不過辦事有善有惡，像農村衛生，便是裨益社會的善事；但是在我國今日農民的心理，衛生事業，並不一定需要。我們要得人民信仰衛生，非憑藉上述敎育宣傳不可，使他們把信仰神卜的苦心；轉來信仰我們實際有利的衛生，旣然有了信仰的决心，當然他們為了利害的關係，也就產生了慷慨解囊，樂予捐助的力量：然而單靠着地方上人的籌欵，是沒有持久性的，是有限的，必須有賴政府經常費的主辦，如有不足之數，再得慈善機關的協助；那麼經濟來源確定了，負責辦理衛生的人，固可安心責守；同時也可增加作事的精神；設備當可酌量增加，不致使這偉大的農村衛生事業有中斷之慮焉。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（八十九）腎臟結石（上）</p>
<p>（問）　腎臟結石，是怎樣生成的？</p>
<p>（答）　我們的尿中，原來有許多結晶性物質溶解在裏面而排泄到體外的。若有了障碍而起沉澱的時候，便能在腎臟內的一定部分變成砂石等類。凡結成細小的粒子時，呌做腎砂；稍粗大的呌做腎礫；更大的呌做腎石。</p>
<p>（問）　腎臟結石的生成，是吾兩側同時起的？</p>
<p>（答）　普通在一側的腎盃內生成，若下行到輸尿管內，就成為輸尿管結石；再下降而到膀胱內，就成為膀胱結石。</p>
<p>（問）　這種腎臟結石，化學上分折起來，有幾種成分？性狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　腎臟結石的化學成分，有尿酸鹽類，燐酸鹽類，草酸鹽類等。尿酸鹽結石，色褐或黃，硬固，表面平滑，剖面有層决。燐酸鹽結石，灰白色而軟，可用兩指壓碎，能溶於醋酸中。大都成為膀胱結石。草酸鹽結石，由草酸石灰而成色暗褐，很堅硬，表面粗糙像桑實，剖面有放錢紋，能溶於無機酸中。此外還有炭酸鹽結石。Cystiu結石，Xantlhin結石，ndigo結石等，都很少見。</p>
<p>（問）　身體上有什麼原因存在時纔發生腎臟結石？</p>
<p>（答）　成結石之先，必定有一種基質存在，同時尿液有異常時纔得發生。基質，不外上皮片，黏液或血液的凝塊，細菌塊，寄生蟲卵等；於是結石成分附着在上面愈積愈大。而結石成分從尿中析出的原因，是尿液濃度和反應的異常。</p>
<p>（問）　腎臟結石和身體或年齡有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　和身體素質的遺傳有關係的。年齡，以三十到六十歲的男子居多。小兒也有起的</p>
<p>（問）　和生活，飲食物等有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）凡肉食過多，嗜飲，常喝石灰太多的飲料，容易起這種病。</p>
<p>（問）　發生腎臟結石，和地理上有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　西洋人較多，尤以英俄荷德等國常見的。這大概因為他們日常的飲食多含鹽類支改。</p>
<p>（問）　腎臟結石，初起時病人現什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　若結石不留存於腎盂或腎盞內時，或很小而容易排出的時候，大都不起什麼病狀。有時因為細菌的傳染而績發腎盂炎。</p>
<p>（問）　結石逐漸大起來，病人現什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　中等大小的移動性腎結石，往往嵌在腎盂的出口或輸尿管內於是起一種劇烈的疝痛，呌做腎石疝痛。在身體動作後或驟然起腎臟部的激痛。這種劇痛沿輸尿管下行波及膀胱或大腿內面或背部。疼痛有時强，有時弱，也有壓痛點。（未完）</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九十二）從腎臟炎說道眼底的變化（下）</p>
<p>腎臟炎的症候。非常複雜。主要者為尿中混有蛋白的蛋白尿，混有血液的血尿，及最屬危險的尿毒症。但是有一種生理的蛋白尿。不可不與之區別。就是健康人體在長久步行，身體過勞，精神興奮，冷浴及攝取鷄卵等後。常可發現生理的蛋白尿。這是我們所不可不注意的。血尿是因尿中混有多量血色素。所以尿液常帶顯著的血樣顏色。血尿可分為二種。一為血色素尿。赤血球大都崩壞。尿中存有遊離的血色素。一為血球尿。赤血球概能保持牠的原形。而混於尿中。尿毒症的症候。可別為二。就是神經性及炎性症候。在神經性症候中，常以頭痛最為顯著。頭痛常可蔓延全頭部。有時限局於前頭，顱頂部，或後頭部。至若炎性症候。則為發生皮膚疾患。稱為尿毒性皮疹。最多的，當推慢性濕疹。尿毒症有時且可發生頑固下痢，聲音嘶嗄，急性聲門水腫，肺炎，尿毒性肋膜炎，心　炎，腹膜炎，胸膜炎，尿毒性衂血，及尿毒性紫斑病等等危險病症。尿毒症若有尿毒性痙攣發作。則多取致死的轉歸。所以腎臟炎患者，一旦陷入尿毒症。輙可表示已達危險的時期。再腎臟炎患者，皮膚多呈强度蒼白色（這是因為發病後赤血球及血色素量减少的綠故。）並來皮膚浮腫。浮腫初發於顏面。眼臉著明腫脹。因此眼臉裂亦卽狹小。不久全身皮膚，亦發强度的浮腫。</p>
<p>讀了上面所述的一節。我們大概已可得到腎臟炎的相當認識。不過眼底的變化。亦屬重要。切不可忽視。因為眼底的變化。往往可作診斷的輔助。所以醫者，遇有腎臟炎的嫌疑者。固然先行檢騐尿液。同時尙須檢查眼底者。無非求其診斷的確實啊。但是這也並非單以腎臟炎為然。就是在糖尿病，梅毒，結核，外傷，以及血管硬化症等時，亦常引起眼底的變化。所以在這等時候。也是應當檢查的。眼底的變化大都屬於網膜的疾患。現在姑就由腎臟炎所引起的網膜炎。略為一述。</p>
<p>腎臟炎性網膜炎，又稱蛋白尿性網膜炎。在腎臟炎患者，的有百分之十。可以發生本症。尤以在慢性腎臟炎移行於腎臟萎縮，或於腎臟萎縮進行的時候為多。又若姙娠性腎臟炎亦常發見。牠的症侯。就是兩眼網膜發生出血，白斑，及靜脈的鬱血與蛇行。視神經乳頭亦發赤，混濁，腫脹。於黃斑部的周圍及視神經乳頭的鄰近部。發生星狀的白斑，或大小黃色的斑紋。患者自覺視力陷於障礙。本症的預後。大都不良。牠的治療。應以醫治腎臓炎為主。周夢白</p>

<p>四，枸杞Lycium　Chinense　Chinense　Mill</p>
<p>（植物）自生於原野，路傍，落葉小灌木也。小枝生刺，屢有變化。葉柔軟，有柄，作披針形或倒卵形，其端有尖銳者，有圓鈍者。夏日自葉腋間開淡紫色之鐘狀花，花瓣作五淺裂。漿果係橢圓形，色紅卽熟。</p>
<p>（生藥）地骨皮（枸杞皮）Cortex　radicisLycii，係剝取其根皮而乾燥之者也。本品作管狀或半管狀，長的五公分，粗的一公分。表面有污黃色或黃褐色，內面呈淡褐色，質粗糙輕鬆。破折面不平坦。本品有緩和之香氣，味先甘後苦，均輕微。</p>
<p>枸杞葉Folium　Lycii，係採集其葉而乾燥之者也。</p>
<p>枸杞子Fructus　Lycii，係採集其果實而成。</p>
<p>（成分）僅被證明者，果實中有　Betain之存在。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊說：地骨皮及枸杞葉，有解熱之效。又以枸杞子所製之枸杞酒，可用作虛弱者之强壯藥。枸杞酒，係以枸祀子（生）五升搗碎，裝入絹袋，再以酒二斗，密封冷浸之，的經二週卽成。</p>
<p>枸杞酒，補虛，去勞熱，長肌肉，益顏色，肥健人。枸杞葉作羹，小苦。俗諺云：去家千里，勿食蘿摩枸杞。此言二物補益精氣，强盛陰道也。</p>
<p>處方例：人參地骨皮散，用治結核諸症之解熱藥。人參，地骨皮，柴胡，黃茵，生地黃　各一五·〇</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第三〇四問）　牙髓沒有死的深蛀洞，有時為什麼要用兩種材料塡補？</p>
<p>答　深的蛀洞，已近牙髓，所以應該先舖一層不透冷熱的水門汀做底，上面再用金屬物塡補。</p>
<p>（第二〇五問）　牙根管用什麼材料塡補？</p>
<p>答　用樹膠做成的細條子（尋常呌做假神經）和消毒藥配成的糊劑，塡入根管。牙根管填好後，上面再鋪一層水門汀，其餘部分，就可用尋常補蛀洞的材料完全補好。</p>
<p>第八節　拔牙問題</p>
<p>（第二〇六問）　那幾種牙齒應該拔去？</p>
<p>答　下列的幾種應該拔去：（一）無法塡補不能裝鑲的蛀牙牙脚等；（二）發生劇痛無法治愈的患牙；（三）已經動搖無法固植的牙齒，或是已經破裂的牙齒；：（四）已經化膿醫治無效，而會危及健康的患牙；（五）妨碍裝鑲全口拔牙的牙齒牙根；（六）無用而有碍的牙齒，如過剩變位齒等。</p>
<p>（第二〇七問）　拔牙前有什麼事情要吿訴牙醫生的？</p>
<p>答　凡心臟有病的人，平素出血不易止的人，平索有神經病或易患洋癎風的人，或是神經衰弱已經數日失眠的人，應該把他的病苦吿知醫生，若是不宜拔的時候，就可以停北，或侯至將來再拔。又已經有四五月身孕的婦人，也應該吿訴醫生，這些都是為愼重起見，免得醫生一個不留心，貿然動手。</p>
<p>（第二〇八問）一日中什麼時候拔牙最為相宜</p>
<p>答　上午最為妥當，晚間不甚相宜。</p>
<p>（第二〇九問）　拔牙會痛嗎？</p>
<p>答　在從前時代，拔牙確是一樁痛苦可怕的事情。但自很安全靈效的麻醉藥發明後，除非有特別情形，可以說是毫無痛苦，簡直同剪頭髮，修指甲的一樣，算不得一回事。</p>
<p>（第二一〇問）　拔牙時候，病人為什麼要絕對鎮靜？</p>
<p>答　拔牙旣然不會痛，而且在正式牙醫生處施行，又沒有什麼危險，原是極平常的事，毫無可怕的理由，若是怕反然會發生許多困難。有些拔牙時候的偶發症，是由病人的恐慌而起，所以病人應該絕對鈸定，要有那故事裏所說的刮骨翳瘡奕棋自若的那種態度。古時候是沒有麻醉藥的，在拔牙安全無痛的今日，若再懷着畏懼，眞是庸人自擾，自討病吃，太沒有丈夫氣概了</p>

<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份大致平軟、因長江一帶、本年新米收獲甚豐、業中人心思早已軟化、至業外多頭、則因花紗之覆轍可慮、似亦不再鼓動、故市面遂得步趨正途喊價步步鬆動、迨至下午開盤、本月分因係最後一日、行家之貨自行收回不少、所以市氣尙定、至八月份以下、則以粉市跌風甚盛、業內外之多脫手高貨尙能站定甚狂、故近跌七八分、遠跌一角零、觀察後步、尙看繼疲、于現貨市面、高貨尙能站定、特高貨四元五角半、至五角二角、廠方應酬二千餘包、中次各擋、各廠一到處擯住、還價較之前週、須短一角零、故無見交云、</p>

<p>所受法幣及走私之影響如何</p>
<p>上海市社會局近就去年十一月實施法幣起以及本年四月以後走私猖獗之情形、所被於、市生活費指數之影響何如、是誠大可注意之一問、該題局已為詳密之研究、茲為　要列左、</p>
<p>房租類　在最近八個月中、各類指數祇房租一類、是趨勢降低、二十五年房租類指數為一一六·七八、計較上年低百分之三·一三、市內房屋最近三四年來、因市面蕭條、寬閉日益增多、惟初時工人住屋尙未波及、自上年以來、因俏工廠歇業和解雇工人關係、工人失業或减工以後收入驟减、遂携帶眷屬各回家郷、或則把原來很侷促的住屋、再事擁擠一下、以求房租支出的减少、因此工人住宅區域內前樓後樓的召租條張貼殆遍、二房東為早日租出减少空房錢的負担、减、價出租、甚或以無利可圖、視為畏途、整幢的房屋也就學關着了、因此大房東也相率减租了、但房租雖减、工人仍覺不勝負担、故目前房租的减低、不僅無補於工人住屋問題的改進、更足以顯映工人生活的不景氣、</p>
<p>食物類　法幣實施、對於米價無甚榮辱、食物類指數、年四年十一月份為九〇·六三、較止月僅高百分之二·四二、十二月份因米價趨勢低、指數續降、本年一月份米價雖更挫落其餘麺粉·青菜·荳油·等、都趨昻貴、本類指數升為九五·九三、三月份更續增至九九·八九、四月份秈米價加突昻但蔬菜大致跌價、指數降至九四·五一、但五六兩月米價續跌、指數更降至九三·四八及九三·六九、</p>
<p>衣着類　去年十一月份衣着類指數為八六·一四、較上月漲百分之四·三一、因各項物品價目均以法幣施行而呈漲勢、十二月及一月份一致續升、一月份指數為九〇·八八、二月份更升至九三·〇一、三四兩月細布條格布及綫呢價均回落、指數徘徊九一·五〇左右、五月份起受走私影響、貨價暴落指數跌至八七左右、</p>

<p>— （陸昌藩）</p>
<p>現代的人把生命看得太輕了，試看上海市社會局的自殺者的統計說：每四小時平均有自殺者一人。」不！也有人把生命看得太重了，試聽「化呌子的生命」一句話。從以上兩點可把生命分為兩大類：生命，輕如鴻毛：生命，重於泰山。</p>
<p>「『死』和『生』那個乾淨？」這問題你們試向多數的民衆問問，便知道他們的回答對不對？我敢斷定一句話，他門總是這樣回答：「當然死乾凈—」我們要研究他們為什麼要這樣的回答？問題很容易解答的：他們以為看得出的齷齪是齷齪。其實，看不出的齷齪比看得出的齷齪還要齷齪得多。好比列强以槍砲屠殺我軍民，用武力侵略我土地，在他們看起來，纔是屠殺，侵略。什麼經濟侵略……在他們是不知道的。</p>
<h3 id="c225">閨詞拾豔 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>閒讀古人詩詞，描寫閨中人的情緒的，幾乎占了韻文中最大的成分。其中描寫到兩性之間，不可言喩之處，每使讀者如臨其境，如見其人，心旌搖搖不能自主。然而這些大都是老面皮的男性詩人寫出來的。</p>
<p>女子的羞澀性比較男子重些，女子詩詞作品之中，雖然富於陰柔之美，但十分猥褻佻豔的詞句，總還不敢吐露。可是也未嘗沒有例外。例如隋朝丁六孃的「十索曲」，是多麼惹人憐愛的歌詞。其中索花枕一曲云：「蘭房下翠帷，蓮帳舒鴛錦。歡情宜早暢，密意須同寢。欲共作纏綿，從郞索花枕。」</p>
<p>又如羅愛愛的「贈郞」絕句云；『戚郞千金意，含嬌抱郞宿。試作帷中音，羞開燈前目。』這樣細膩豔蕩的詞句，眞是寫得如醉如狂了。</p>
<p>唐史鳳姬有「神鷄枕」一絕云：『枕繪鴛鴦久與棲，新裁霧穀鬥神鷄。與郞酣夢渾忘曉，鷄亦留連不肯啼。』</p>
<p>文學的作品，是個性的顯映。女子的貞吾，大都也由於天性。唐朝一個女才子李季蘭，五六歲時咏薔薇云：『經時未架却，心緒亂縱橫。』她的父親看了不悅道：「他日必是個失行婦了。」後來果然做了一個男女社交公開的交際花。有一次與羣賢會集，劉長卿有陰痿疾，季蘭用成句調侃他道：「出氣日夕佳？」劉脫口對曰：「衆鳥欣有託。」其豔蕩若此。</p>
<p>還有唐朝著名交際花薛濤女士，十餘歲時，有一天她的父親指着天井裏的梧桐咏道：『庭除一古桐，聳幹入雲中。』令濤績之。濤曰：『枝迎南北鳥：葉送往來風。』她父親為之不悅良久。後來薛濤出入鎭幕，歷事十一鎭，皆以詩受知。往來唱和的，有元稹，白居易，牛僧孺，令狐楚，裴度，張籍，劉禹錫諸名士。晚年居蜀中浣花所，建吟詩樓。享壽七十二歲。</p>
<p>倘使李季蘭薛濤生於今世，必為婦女運動之健將，替被壓抑的女界揚眉吐氣也。</p>

<p>友有執業於保險洋行者，為余述一事：西人某，家富，火險保戶也。一日，挾一地毯詣謁行主。欵接之下，展其毯，頗華貴，而旁灼一孔。據渠自稱：以吸捲烟失愼，灰墜而餘燼釀菑。索賠幣百，其新毯之値也，出發單為證。行主騐之，孔有焦暈，遽如所請償焉。</p>
<p>余乃論之：賠欵之迅速亦恒事，乃其賓主間請諾所據之因，人人視為卑不足道之一烟灰所灼之小孔，以其適符火險之契，遂相履行都不置疑，是可風也！」</p>
<p>或者曰：「使此保戶而為華人，亦得同此待遇否也？」</p>
<p>則余將應之曰：「所惜此保戶而非華人，彼行乃不得登報鳴謝之効！彼又何樂而不以戔戔之所費，仗此事實為招徠之資哉？」</p>
<p>又或曰：「彼，富者也。無心之失自肇之，而索賠如其値，母乃迹近苛細，而示人以不廣乎？」</p>

<p>自從美人魚仔國內外出盡鋒頭而後，一般蜜斯之流，也肯分其逛跳舞塲，跑電影院的光陰，消磨於游泳池邊。什麼自由式咧，蛙式咧，背泳咧：這些新鮮名詞，現在伊們也能琅琅上口，如數家珍了。</p>
<p>游泳，在鄕下人看來，是樁平淡無奇的事。大熱天光，便是黃毛了頭也會在水塘裏划共雙脚，潑水取樂。伊們也不知什麼式，伊們也不穿什麼游泳衣，伊們也不需什麼「甜心」來攙扶伊們一下，伊們也不想出什麼鋒頭。伊們只知自樂其樂，與都市裏的蜜斯們完全各異其趣，而蜜斯們可以傲人的地方，或者也就在這一點</p>
<p>有位朋友吿訴我：某處有個游泳池，一輩蜜斯趨之若騖。當然囉，在這種塲合，自有一輩英雄追隨伊們之後，盡那攙扶保護之責；幷且伊們也需要這　英雄來壯一下膽子的。因此之故，而「托」的糾紛遂鬧成不可開交，甚有演成全武行好戲的。</p>
<p>何謂托？這說來頗　覺有趣。原來那輩蜜斯們在將游泳的當兒，已有如臨深淵之懼；尤其是在躍入的一刹那，一顆芳心正和池水的激動恰成正比。因此，有一輩英雄情願預伏在池中，為伊們托這末一托！據說這一托，英雄們對之，有意想不到的愉快；而蜜斯們呢，則可稍减其驚恐之心。誰托誰，當然各有各的禁臠。誤托，或猶可原；設從權代託，或妄冀非分，那末英雄和英雄就要怒髮上指，結下大仇了。</p>

<h3 id="c230">高爾基的一生（上） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 林儷琴</p>
<p>聯當代唯一偉大作家瑪克辛·高爾基Maxim　Gorky死了，這是世界文壇的最大的不幸，也是永遠不可補償的損失！我們對於他的溘然長逝，應當表示最後的敬意，在文藝的園地裏　起一幅黑紗，以悼念這顆燦爛的巨星之殞落。</p>
<p>我們今日一致悼念的瑪克辛·高爾基，他不僅是蘇聯的普羅文學的導師，他的崇高的地位，實已高據着世界文壇權威者的寳座。而高氏熱心於他的祖國的新社會之建設與創造，以及獻身勞働階級而致力於布爾塞維克之勝利的璀璨的著述；尤其是在尼古拉第二暴力下參加革命工作時代的堅苦卓越的精神和毅力之受人景仰。所以高氏的長逝，宜乎受全蘇聯人民及其黨政領袖們的一致哀悼，並認高氏之死，乃列寗死後蘇聯的第二莫大損失。</p>
<p>在這里，我因為高氏的偉大，覺得隨便寫上一點很平凡的哀悼之詞是太渺小而且又太菲薄了的。因此，改為寫一點關於他的生活之剪影及其藝術的斷面在這裏，聊以代替我們呈獻給他的虔敬的誄辭—不過為了認識的淺薄，難免有許多錯誤。。</p>
<p>高爾基的大名像空氣一樣地包容着地球，但，這「瑪克辛·高爾基」還祗是筆名，他的眞名呌亞歷克賽·瑪克辛摩維支·彼西科夫Alexey　Maximovich　Peshkov。以一八六八年三月二十九日生於中部俄羅斯的尼什尼·諾甫哥羅特　Nijni　Novogoroy。幼年時代因生於勞動者之家，家境貧困至於沒有能力使他進學校去讀書。</p>
<p>一八七八年高氏十歲，這年的秋天，他就開始用自己的力氣去賺錢生活，當了鞋匠店的學徒。翌年又從鞋匠店而轉投到一個繪圖所裏做學徒。但他在那裏所學的並不是繪圖，而是盥洗洒掃的家僮工作。</p>
<p>一八八〇年春，高氏因生活條件過於痛苦，便從繪圖所逃到伏爾加河邊，做了一個輪船上的廚子的徒弟，這廚子名呌施慕里，是一個深思好學的退伍軍曹，性情和靄，循循善誘，從他，高氏便開始知道了讀書的滋味。</p>
<p>一八八三年，高氏因讀書與味之增高，使他覺到應該去求一些有系統的學問，於是獨自流浪到喀出，私心想進喀山大學讀書，可是，這種理想在他的一度試探之後就立刻幻滅在現實之前；因為當沙皇時代的高等學府是專為培植公子各兒和千金小姐們而設立的，怎麼容許道赤腳的窮小子跨儘門檻呢！他沒有法子，只好仍然重整他得勞力的執役，投身在當地一家麵包廠裏當一名副手。在喀山，他的求學志頤雖已絕望，但他却於無意間得着接近知識階級中人的機會，並且還加入了讀書會的組織；因此曉得一點當時政治的概况和黑暗，而啟發了他將來的革命思想；更從親身的經歷，而得到許多非人生活的體騐，以造成他將來的偉大之創作。他旅居喀山有四五年之久，一邊勞瘁地在工塲中幹着粉堆的工作，同時還偷閒勤奮地讀着杜斯妥耶夫斯基的「窮人們」這一類的作品。後來他對於革命的熱情愈益增高，便加進了所謂「被監視着的人們」的團體，開始他的革命的實際活動，於是高氏的行動也就開始受了警探們的注意了。</p>
<p>一八八九年二十一歲，高氏已從流浪的旅途上走回了他的故鄕—尼什尼·諾甫哥羅特。這年他受了徵兵的檢騐，因肺部不健全沒有合格，才得免掉軍服的東縛，在一個律師事務所一裏當書記—這律師名拉寗，對於高氏的將來是有着很大的影響：他從這律師那裏讀着了很多的書；也就為了這一層原故，在本年十月，第一次被捕入獄，監禁一月，被監禁的罪狀是為了讀那不合於他的智識及敎育程度的而又不需要的特種性質的書籍。</p>
<p>一八化一年二十三歲，高氏又離開他的故鄕而飄泊到高加素的首邑第夫利斯，在一個鐵路工塲裏做工。他利用暇日記述下自身所遭受的經歷和見聞，寫成了他的處女作「瑪加爾·丘特拉」。於翌年九月二十五日署上「瑪克辛·高爾基」的筆名，發表在第夫利斯的地方新聞「高加索」報上。從這兒起始，就是高氏從事文學的發端—四十年後，卽一九三二年同月同日，蘇聯人民及黨政首腦為紀念高氏從事文學四十週生活，特舉行空前盛大的慶祝會，蘇聯政府為酬謝高氏的革命功結，特贈予最榮譽的列寗勳章，並由慶祝會决議：把尼什尼·諾甫哥羅持改名為「高爾基格勒」，以紀念高氏幼年在那裏的生活。</p>

<p>— （耀祖）</p>
<p>電療之在今日。醫界已奉為治療百病之圭臬。而於花柳症中之淋病為最。例如急性者用提亞斯電療。慢性者用短波透熱電療。莫不收其良效。蓋淋菌遇四十二度以上之電熱。雖深藏潛伏。亦必因之殲滅無遺。淋病之急性症狀。為尿道粘膜紅腫。膿汁淋漓。痛癢劇烈。放尿之際允甚。常引起包皮紅腫。鼠蹊部淋巴腺發炎。尿中帶血。白衣團塊絲條。尿中歷歷可見。在此急性時期。則唯用提亞斯電療。並輔以注射及內服不難於治愈。慢性者。都由急性淋遷延轉變而來。撤尿時有黃色之粘液發生。混於尿道中。早起時被膿汁封着尿道口。有時感覺騷癢或灼熱。而腫脹疼痛則並不厲害。但此時若保養不得法。則症候隨時可以變惡。副睪丸炎。膀胱炎。攝護腺炎。關節炎等。往往於此時誘發。故淋病如已入於慢性期。即須施以短波透熱電療。及各種適宜之治法。滬上治療淋病。定價公道而電療設備之最完善者。當推父子醫院。彼以十數年之經騐。復加以電氣療治之良助。無怪其可得神效也。</p>

<p>因為有幾種生殖器病。如攝護腺炎。尿道炎。精液漏等。很像是淋病的微象。普通人往往不容易辨別。因而私心惴惴。雜藥亂投。反而把病弄壞了。還有一種是淋病未愈。或初染淋病。却不把他認做淋病。因而遷延貽誤。豈不謬哉。要鑒別這種病的原因。最好是用顯微鏡來檢騐小便。可以分別出有沒有淋菌。就可斷定是不是淋病。這樣就不致有盲從醫藥的弊病了。在上海。設有檢騐淋病。而且是不收費用的。那末只有法租界寗波路父子醫院了。就是婦女之患白帶。而欲檢查是否為淋病者。也很使利，而且是同樣的優待。</p>

<h3 id="c244">廣東人向陳濟棠算舊賬 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日香港電，陳濟棠奉中央令，須待粵省移交淸楚後，始准離粵，又電，陳濟棠二十四日遷入外國醫院，因粵人進行追算舊賬，林翼中獻議，謂如不得護照出洋，先避居台灣，再行他往，所有金銀貴物，計値八千餘萬元，由陳維周商請某國銀行，秘密保存，粵前總部及執部政會職員，以欠薪尙未發淸，二十四日晚有七十餘人，由省來港，向陳濟棠要求維持生活，由以上兩條新聞看來，陳濟棠此次出走，並不將移交手續弄淸，而部下欠薪，亦未發給，此篇賬大大的應該向陳儕棠一算，不但中央應該向陳濟棠算，卽粵省一般官民，也應該向陳濟棠算，决不可輕易放過。</p>
<p>陳濟棠倔强西南，不受中央命令，迄已多年，而ｙｉ　方揑稱粵省經濟困難，要挾中央補助，一方面關了大門，橫征暴歛，烟捐，賭捐，以及苛捐雜稅，層層剝削，粵省民脂民膏，已被陳濟棠吸收迨盡，故此次下野而去，其所有金銀財物共計價値，的有八千餘萬之鉅，試問此種財物何來？無非多是粵民的膏血，而陳氏旣擁有如許之財產，而對於部下的欠薪，揑不肯付，則其搜刮民財，以為私產，而對於地方一切建設事業，往往假財政竭蹶為名，不能實心舉辦，所謂禍國殃民四字，陳氏實足當之，今他已去，此篇賬若不向他算，更有何賬可算，此時若不向他算，更待何時可算。</p>
<p>陳濟棠獨霸西南，反抗中央命令，業已數載，中央鑑於內戰之不宜發生，而號令之必須統一，不惜委曲求全，欲以和平手腕解决，而陳氏狐埋狐搰，反覆無常，絕對沒有誠意，安內之局，一時未易吿成，攘外之舉，天然更無從着手，以致西北局面，形成不可收拾之勢，此種責任，誰當負之？無非陳氏負之。今陳氏雖去，而數年來延擱之局面，我民已重受其累，卽使陳氏因內部的反抗，不得不下野他去，而收拾此種潰敗之時局，不免費力更多，故此次陳氏之去，不僅應該向陳氏淸算經濟上的賬，而破壞國家統一賬，也應該和他淸算。</p>
<p>陳氏做了天南王多年，致國家形成分割之勢，中央對於政治，軍事，經濟，諸大政，完全不能收指臂之效，其罪已擢髮難數，今其他去，又擁八千餘萬價値之金銀寳器，面團團去作異國富家翁，未免太覺寫意，而粵省一般欠薪的官員，和深受痛苦的一般民衆，此種淚更去向誰氏灑呢，我故謂此次陳濟棠這篇壞賬，不但中央應該向陳濟棠算，粵省官民多應該向陳濟棠算。</p>
<h3 id="c245">游泳和風化 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>在我們政府派選男女游泳選手出席世運會中，據報載，華北當局却因為「游泳池男女雜泳，有傷風化」，而「飭市府卽查封」了。</p>
<p>我有一位朋友看到這樣的消息，他表示同意說，在我們中國，游泳是應該禁的。他以後又說出理由來，他說：在我們的所謂游泳池裏，與其說是游泳，那母寗說是在水池裏浸浸，好在去的人也並非為游泳而去，女的大都是為去拍照，好在什麼畫報上刊上「游泳家」或「善游泳」等字眼；男的也大都抱非分之想，借游泳的名目去親近親近女人；就卽使是眞正為游泳而去，並且是靠游泳出了名吧，那也祇多幾個「美人魚」，讓一班無聊的傢伙去像捧角似的捧她，替她執鞭，替他做起居注。所以歸到結論：他認為游泳是有百害而無一利，應該禁止。</p>
<p>我的那位朋友是頗有些「古道可風」的，他平時就好引用些經文來蹬明現在的「人心不古，世道日非。」這一次當然也是有「古」氣，但是，我依舊把他的話記在這裏，這倒並非是我也愛好時髦，（中國是個「古」國，這年頭是崇「古」的年頭！）學起「古」來了，實在是他所說的話裏，有許多的的確確是眞實的現象，我們如果不諱病忌醫，那麼這些話是有回味一下的必要的。</p>
<p>不過我却不能同意於他的觀點，因之也不和他的主張相同。</p>
<p>有不少的小姐到泳池游去是為了拍照，有不少的少爺到游泳池去是為了某種非分之想，這都是事實，然而，這是佔十分之幾的數目呢？用老花眼鏡來看新的男女關係，是無往而不「有傷風化」的，手扶手的在路上走，在維護風化者的眼光中這不是也「有傷風化」嗎？更且，除了游泳之外不能再「有傷風化」了嗎？（偸偸摸摸地娶三個五個，或者甚至不至此數，不眞是口口聲聲，維護「風化」的道學家們幹的常事嗎？那才是眞的「有傷風化」！）把一部份來看作全體，這難道是事理之平？</p>
<p>再說，以一部份所謂「蕩娃和淫婦」「醜行」，難道就能否定游泳的意，以這與游泳本身無關的事情來禁止游泳，不是因噎廢食的行為，這更是的智者所取的。</p>
<p>至淤「美人魚」的敎訓，那更是與游泳的本身無關，這是凡稍明事理者沒有不知道的。舊社會把女人一向看做玩具，一旦有一個傑出的玩具出現了，因為新鮮，於是在上者帶着玩笑的態度玩弄之，一班吮膿舐痔的好事之徒為了迎合在上者的歡心，便也立刻狂捧吶喊，以張聲勢，在中間揩些油水，至於被捧者呢，因為意志薄弱，認識不足的綠故，便也受寵若驚起來。</p>
<p>更且，華北現狀如何？這在讀者之前眞如瞭如指掌的事情，我們實在「不盡欲言」。在這個間不容髮的險惡環境中，居然還好整以暇的注意到游泳池和「有傷風化」，這使我們除了猜測是「國家事管牠娘」，或轉移民衆視綫之外，實在再想不到其他原因，難道，眞的呌我們用「風化」去抵抗敵人的武力，文化，經濟等等侵略嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c246">上海養蛙塲參觀記 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）年來國人頗多致力於生產事業，尤其是農村副業之提倡，如養鷄，養蜂，養鴿，養兎等，現在各地改良飼牧者，更不乏人；且畜植塲的成立，也幾乎到處都有。</p>
<p>我國本來在世界上是號稱以農立國的國家；地大物博，氣偎溫和，山川地利之富厚，土貨物產之豐盈，實堪執世界各國之牛耳。且統計全國人民百分之七十以上為農民，惜乎國人墨守舊法，不知改良，而當局執政者又未及注意及此，所以大好富源一任其湮沒，於是農村破產，便成了我國不景氣的致命傷。然而我們廻觀歐西及日本各國，他們對於生產事業的研究提倡不遺餘力者，我們能不憬然麼。</p>
<p>但是在這兩年中間，曾有不少新興事業的發現，譬如羊奶塲，養蛙塲等，我相信這些新興事業，只要政府能加以保護和獎勵，人民能加以提倡與改進，那末不但其前途的發展無可限量，而有助農村經濟更匪淺鮮呢。</p>
<p>養蛙事業在我國還是創舉，而且在一般人聽來也之得驚異，然而它在歐覺美及日本各國却早已非常發達了。並且美國及日本均有大規的養蛙廠設立；而除了蛙肉供食外，其蛙更可製成許談多革品，像美國現在已有蛙皮領帶，蛙皮鞋，蛙皮篋等之製造，但其定價却非常昻貴，决不是一般人所用得起的。</p>
<p>蛙在農家是一種益蟲，牠能捕食害蟲而保護作物；在故鄉有一句鄉諺呌「一隻田鷄看七棵稻，」這就說明了蛙對於保護農作物的功勞。</p>
<p>上海養蛙塲是沈釗明君創設的，還不過一年歷史；而他最初祗向美國西雅圖養蛙塲購來原種珍寳巨蛙六對，現在除已分讓出者外，自已塲里尙畜有十餘對，小蛙及蝌蚪却不下數千萬頭。</p>
<p>它的地址在江灣體育會紀念路，我昨天乘公共汽車到江灣之後，經過了許多時候的找尋，纔在一處籬笆上發現了一塊「上海養蛙由此向南」的小牌子，於是我順着籬笆傍邊走去，在隔着一爿田的地方；就望見了一座　黃色的牆上有一個大蛙字，下面却是一個不十分大的籬笆園。</p>
<p>走到木柵門邊，我正想舉手叩門時，里面却竄出了一條狗來，幸虧木柵門關着，不然準會有咬一口的危險！後來從里面走出了一個人，將那條狗喝了進去；同時向我招呼了一下。我向他說明了來意，他就表示着十分高與的引導我向園里走去：</p>
<p>「沈先生此刻還在上海寫字問里辦公，大的要六點鐘可以回來，不過星期六下午，及星期日，他是在這里的。」他一壁走一壁向我說。</p>
<p>這個園，的佔三畝多地方，外進是養蛙塲辦公室，和沈先生的私邸，里進大小蛙池共有五個，一個是蛙種池，一個是新蛙池，一個是蝌蚪池，還有一個却養着廣東田鷄，一個是空着預備更換的。各池均用板籬分隔，池畔留有草地一方，以供蛙在岸上歇息，或捕食蟲類。池面覆蓋以蘆蓆，以避炎烈陽光。</p>
<p>蛙池之大小，大約十四五方尺，兩三尺深，不過新蛙池似較大，蝌蚪池最小，池邊上裝有電燈，是誘蟲蛾麕集以供蛙捕食的。蛙之飼養，管理上比較任何動物為易，且不必餵以何種食料，他們自會生長蕃殖。</p>
<p>據說每頭種蛙能產卵萬粒，產出後卽須分池，不然等到孵出蝌蚪而會蠕動時，便要給母蛙吃食；而這一萬粒卵中，至少能孵出八九隻新蛙。新蛙出生後，的須兩年方可蕃殖，並且其生殖力非常强盛。</p>
<p>我現在且將蛙之生活，及養蛙之利益略為介紹於後，以供一般有意經營農村副業者作為參考。</p>
<p>蛀，Frogs，俗乎田鷄，牠是一種水陸兩棲的脊椎動物，體短而闊，突目大口，前足短，後足長，將牠拉直平躺時極像一個人形，善於跳躍游泳，畫畏日光，恒喜夜出活動。常棲於池沼水田中，搜捕蚱蜢蝗蝻蚊子以及一切昆蟲以生活，對於農作物很有益處。</p>
<p>每年的三四月間卽為交尾期，初夏產卵於池中水草中，由雄蛙守護，卵在一種透明潛滑的液體中，漸漸孵化為幼蟲——蝌蚪，至三個月後成蛙形，五六個月便可完全成蛙了。至於蛙之生命，聽說也有八九年之久，惟其生殖能力在五六年後卽衰弱。</p>
<p>夏天是蛙活躍的季節，但，每至冬</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>令，蛙便蟄居士中，過渡冬眠，不食，亦不活動，這時不須管理，待至春暖」再出活動。所以冬季乃養蚌家休息之期。</p>
<p>養蛙不特比任何畜牧簡而易舉，抑且本輕利厚，因為養蛙塲旣不需廣大的土地，更不必考究之建築，有兩三畝地，數百元之資本，卽能創辦一個養蛙塲，而且塲中有一兩個人管理足矣。</p>
<p>自養之蛙比普通者肥嫩，且每隻有兩三磅重；其味鮮美而含有多量之滋養料，蛋白質極富，食之對於人體之營養非常有益。所以養蛙，我覺得不論在都市里或鄕村中，都是一椿値得提倡的新興事業，並且我預期它的需要將來能够和魚肉一樣地普遍。</p>
<p>我參觀過了蛙池，又到他們的辦公室里去坐了一回；在寫字臺上的一隻玻璃瓶里，用火酒浸着一隻已死的巨蛙，我看了牠的形狀很有點可怕。據那位管理員吿訴我，這一隻巨蛙因由美國運來時，在海關檢查的當兒不小心而弄死的。現在他們塲里的蛙種有限，而各方來定購者甚衆，如南京金陵大學，及各處畜牧塲農校或私人等，故大有供不應求之勢，於此我們便可窺見國人之注意養蛙事業的一斑了。</p>
<p>這種蛙種之定價極昂，二年以上之原種珍寳巨蛙（當年可以蕃殖），每對須國幣二十四元，一年以內的新蛙（二年以蕃殖）亦須十二元一對，而且甚至還有三十多元或四十多元者。</p>
<p>回來，我順便還向他們討了一本黃中成君編的實利養蛙法。</p>

<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>我已經寫過一篇荷了。這裏再寫一些，自然寫法是不同的，而寫不好却同樣。</p>
<p>荷的稱謂是最多的，未開的呌「菡萸」，已開的呌「芙蓉」，又呌「芙蕖」果房呌「蓮」，葉是「荷」，莖是「藕」，其它名字自然還有，但淺陋的我却不知道了。</p>
<p>宋理學家周某是以荷比「君子」，他的愛蓮說，曾經一度選入過敎課書，現在也仍為一些人所稱道。其實遠在他老先生之前，為理學家之流所痛心疾首的「穢亂春宮」的「武　則天」時已經有把述花來比她的面首六郞張昌宗的「悄龐兒」（再恕我用一個傳奇中的名辭）了。「六郞貌如蓮花，不是蓮花如六郞。」不是古今佳話嗎？長恨歌「芙蓉如面柳如眉」的芙蓉也正是荷花，而不是淸愁風露，寂寞秋江的木芙蓉。（未完）</p>

I am quite unfamiliar with the situation. I am deeply grateful for Chairman Jiang's trust in appointing me as the Guangxi Pacification Director.

Jiang offered much comfort and encouragement. The Guangxi problem has not yet been considered. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Executive Yuan Council to be Held in Lushan Today. Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, and Others Rushed from Beijing Yesterday to Attend. Kong Denies the Rumor of Lushan Meeting for Avoiding the Summer Heat is a Misunderstanding. <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. At 10 AM, he visited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for discussions. At 11 AM, he went to the Xiaguan Naval Pier with his son and daughter, boarded the Hai Xing ship to Xun, and then transferred to Lu. Director of General Affairs Xu Jianping and more than ten guards accompanied him. Kong said before leaving that the income tax will still be levied according to the original plan. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 272nd regular meeting of the Executive Yuan will be held in Lu on the morning of the 28th, presided over by President Jiang. It is reported that the agenda for ordinary cases has been compiled by the Yuan and sent to the mountain. Important discussions and appointments and removals will be proposed and decided at the meeting. Except for Jiang Zuobin, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Jia'ao, Wang Shijie, Chen Shuren, Huang Musong, Xu Mo, and Yu Feipeng, who have arrived in Gu and are preparing to attend, Kong Xiangxi and Chen Shaokuan all set off on the morning of the 27th to participate. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi left Beijing on the morning of the 27th and took the customs Hai Xing patrol ship to Xun, then transferred to Lu. Xu Jianping, Ge Dingyuan, and others accompanied him. Senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, such as Li Tang, Gao Bingfang, Pang Songzhou, and Cui Weiwu, all went to the naval pier to see him off. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before leaving Beijing on the morning of the 27th, Kong Xiangxi visited Zhang Qun to discuss important matters. Before leaving, he told reporters that the reason why Chairman Lin, President Jiang, ministers of various ministries and commissions, and himself went to Lu one after another was to avoid the central government's affairs being stagnant due to the hot weather, so they moved to a cooler place to work, not to avoid the summer heat. Moreover, President Jiang used to give instructions to his subordinates under the scorching sun in Lu for several hours. This kind of hard work cannot be said to be avoiding the summer heat, which is a mistake. As for the rumor of the Lushan meeting, it is even more unfounded. Because those who went to Lu this time were all ministers of various ministries and commissions who were working in the capital. If there were matters that needed to be discussed in secret, they could be held in the capital, so why go to Lu for a meeting? I hope the press will correct this. Later, when talking about the implementation of the income tax, Kong said that the income tax is the fairest tax system in the world, and there is no room for opposition. Recently, industrial and commercial groups, without understanding the truth, made excuses for the decline of industry and commerce and demanded a postponement of the tax. They did not know that the government levied income tax on those who have income, and those who have no income are not taxed at all. There is no such thing as a postponement of the tax. This move is a matter of self-disturbance for mediocre people. In recent years, the rural economy has declined abnormally. Farmers still try their best to pay land tax to fulfill their tax obligations. Although industry and commerce are not prosperous, they are still slightly better than farmers. I sincerely hope that the industrial and commercial circles will also follow the spirit of farmers to fulfill their obligations to the country and sincerely support the government, so that the tax system reform plan over the years can be gradually implemented.

<h3 id="e27">The Crisis of the Cotton Textile Industry <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Tianjin telegraphic report, the Japanese Kanebo Corporation has decided to purchase the Huaxin Yarn Factory in Tianjin at a high price. And the Baocheng Yarn Factory in Tianjin sold to the Japanese Yutai, which was established as a branch factory. There is almost no hope of reversing it. Among the six major yarn factories run by Chinese businessmen in Tianjin, Yuda, Yuyuan, and Beiyang were taken over by the Japanese long ago. Now Huaxin and Doucheng have been sold again. Then the only remaining one is Hengyu, which is operated by Chengfu Company, jointly established by China, Zhongnan, Salt Industry, and Jincheng four banks. The number of yarn factories established by Japanese businessmen in China is already large. Now they are acquiring Chinese factories at a huge cost. Their intention is obviously to monopolize the entire yarn industry in China. Japanese businessmen in the yarn factory industry are currently actively engaged in the construction of new factories and the addition of spindles. Under the cooperation of Kanebo, Dai Nippon Spinning, Kanefuchi Spinning, Toyo Spinning and other companies, the number of Japanese yarn spindles in Tianjin is planned to increase by 600,000 within one year. At the same time, Ri Hua, Gong Da, Toyota, Shanghai factories in Shanghai have also decided to increase 150,000 spindles. It is estimated that soon the number of yarn spindles of Japanese capital in China will reach at least more than 3 million. (Currently 2.45 million) The total number of spindles owned by Chinese businessmen exceeds much more. According to last month's statistics, the total number of spindles in Chinese yarn factories across the country is only more than 2.7 million. It is still necessary to remove the tens of thousands of spindles of newly sold factories, as well as countless empty spindles that have been shut down or reduced in work. Since the number of spindles has decreased and the technology is backward, what development can be said. Japanese yarn has already occupied an overwhelming force in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japanese businessmen are not only seeking the development of the yarn factory industry itself. In order to expand the sales of cotton yarn, they are also committed to the production of cotton cloth in China. In March this year, the number of cloth machines in the Shanghai Rihua Textile Factory alone has jumped from 736 to 1,436, an increase of about double. At the same time, Japanese businessmen are also making every effort to monopolize raw cotton. Under the slogans of "economic cooperation," "economic cooperation" and "industrial Japan, agricultural China," North China cotton has long been included in Japan's raw material budget. The Manchurian Railway, Kanebo, and Toyo Spinning are expanding cotton areas and improving seed plans. They are now proceeding step by step. It is expected that there will be a great harvest in the near future. Japan's supply of raw cotton has mostly relied on the United States, India, and Egypt. If the North China cotton planting plan is fully completed, this major raw material problem can be fully resolved nearby.</p>
<p>Looking at the above, the production and sales of yarn and cloth in our country, and the supply and demand of cotton will be completely manipulated by Japanese businessmen in a planned manner. If it is not rescued as soon as possible, the total collapse of China's cotton textile industry can be expected immediately. The textile industry is the main force of China's only national industry. If this collapses, the foundation of the entire national economy will inevitably be shaken.</p>

<p>— Our Correspondent Hu Zhongchi Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(7) Osaka City Hall</p>
<p>The next morning, we went to Osaka City Hall (City Office) for a visit. The City Hall is located on Nakanoshima, by the Oebashi Bridge, and is a magnificent six-story building. The city emblem on the front of the building looks like the character "不" (bu, not). It is said to be a simplified form of the buoy that used to serve as a navigational marker. Inside the hall, the offices are divided into one bureau (electricity) and nine departments (civil engineering, health, harbor, education, industry, general affairs, water supply, social affairs, and audit), and two sections (secretarial and accounting), under the joint management of three assistant officials who assist the mayor. The mayor is elected by the city council, and the assistant officials, along with the revenue officer and deputy revenue officer in charge of financial affairs, are recommended by the mayor and approved by the city council. The current mayor of Osaka is named Kagami Hideo.</p>
<p>We went up the magnificent marble staircase and handed our business cards to a sixteen or seventeen-year-old page in student attire. The Mayor of Osaka then sent the secretary, Mr. Noboru Sanrou, to meet us in the reception room on the floor. Mr. Noboru answered many questions, gifted us with several publications, and accompanied us to the fifth floor. In a large hall where nearly a hundred male and female employees were sitting, drawing, calculating, and typing, he introduced us to Mr. Hirakawa Yoichi, the chief of the general affairs section of the civil engineering department, with whom we had a conversation. From the conversations with the two gentlemen, we learned a little about the recent construction status of Osaka City, as follows:</p>
<p>"The city planning plan decided by Osaka City in 1920 has been fully implemented after several revisions and supplements. The second urban planning project is now underway. The area covered by the urban plan includes the current Osaka City and eleven surrounding towns and villages, totaling an area of 227 square kilometers, of which residential areas account for 30%, commercial areas 14%, industrial areas 37.6%, and undesignated areas 18%. The city currently has 9,500 streets. The most outstanding boulevard, Midosuji, can be fully completed this year. This avenue runs directly from Osaka Station to Namba, is 44 meters wide, has four rows of trees, and is divided into sidewalks, high-speed vehicle lanes, and low-speed vehicle lanes. An underground railway is also built below, with high-speed trains running. This is truly a model road for modern cities. There are also ways to improve the buildings on both sides of the street in urban planning. Roughly speaking, the key parts of the city are designated as fireproof areas, and all buildings must be constructed with fireproof and earthquake-resistant features. The mountainous areas in the suburbs are designated as scenic areas, striving to preserve natural beauty. The commercially prosperous areas are designated as scenic areas, striving for the regularity and beauty of the buildings. As for the bridges in the city, there are more than 1,300 in total, mostly fireproof and earthquake-resistant buildings. However, there are still many wooden ones, and they are now being prepared for demolition and reconstruction.</p>
<p>In addition to urban planning, the most noteworthy construction project is port construction. The initial port construction project in Osaka cost 100 million yen and was largely completed in 1929. The second phase of the port construction project is currently underway. The breakwater is 9,400 meters long in total, and the port area is 6.55 million square meters, which can accommodate ships of more than 10,000 tons. In recent years, Osaka's port services have developed rapidly, so Osaka Port's foreign export trade has already exceeded Yokohama Port's."</p>

<p>Madrid Army Minister General Miajas recently went to the Guadarrama Mountain front north of the capital to decorate military affairs. Once preparations are complete, he will order an attack on the northern rebels who are stubbornly resisting. It is reported that only eight hundred troops remain of rebels near the Leon Pass in the Guadarrama Mountains. After occupying the mountain pass, the government army moved artillery to the summit and fired down from a high position, inflicting heavy losses on the rebel artillery. As for the air force, the rebels only have three old-fashioned planes stationed in Burgos, which is far inferior to the government army. Government aircraft flew to the rebel positions last night to bomb them, and machine gun teams arrived shortly after, further strengthening the government army's momentum. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lisbon According to radio reports from various sources, the rebels now control thirty provinces and parts of three other provinces, while the government controls sixteen provinces and parts of one other province. (26th National Electricity)</p>
<p>Madrid Government forces are fighting fierce battles with the Fascist Party, Royalist Party, and other right-wing rebels in more than four major battles and twenty minor battles across the country today. Major battles occurred in Oviedo, Seville, and the mountain passes of Zaragoza. The number of deaths is uncertain. Communist riots occurred in Hellera, Malaga, Pogeseda, and Albacin, engaging in murder and arson. Thousands of farmers, led by worker leader Founante, besieged the rebels in Oviedo today. Founte said he would spare no sacrifice to eradicate the rebels. The government considers the northern battles to be decisive and has sent General Gasde to command military affairs in the Sierra Pass. The government announced a great victory in Somashira, but in reality, government forces and rebels have had victories and defeats. According to unofficial news, the government army has now occupied the Ardul Turon mountainous area and is building fortifications. A company of female soldiers is rushing to support them, preventing the advance of General Mura's troops. (26th National Electricity)</p>
<p>(London) As the struggle between the Spanish government and the rebels is at a critical juncture, scattered bandits have risen up in various parts of the western border, causing the usual state of terror during local chaos. It is said that the behavior of these scattered bandits is extremely brutal and terrifying. According to refugees who fled from Badajoz in western Spain into Portugal, yesterday, groups of communists broke into the homes of more than a hundred landowners, first insulting their wives and daughters, then cutting off one ear of each homeowner before leaving. Extreme panic has occurred in Vigo, a famous seaport on the west coast of Spain, and all wealthy homes have been looted. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid General Faras, commander of the Spanish government army, told General Gabanilas, commander of the rebels resisting in Zaragoza, "I order you to surrender the city." Mr. Jia replied, "I will never surrender." The two sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting to争该城, the government army has established an air base in Lireda, eighty miles from the city, from which they have repeatedly sent aircraft to bomb the beautiful ancient city, causing heavy damage. There are currently three other dangerous areas outside Madrid: one is Seville, and a column of government troops is advancing towards the city; one is Albayete, 138 miles southeast of the capital. If the government army can occupy the city, the capital's food supply can be guaranteed; one is San Sebastian, a resort in northern Spain, where government forces are gradually gaining ground around it.

<p>Madrid Although the Spanish government troops have repelled the rebels threatening Madrid, causing them to retreat to Segovia, forty miles from the western capital, General Franco, the leader of the rebels, told a Reuters reporter in Tangier, Spanish Morocco, that the turmoil is progressing well. He said that the Foreign Legion and indigenous troops have all joined us and are willing to fight to the last man. My headquarters will soon move to Seville. The supply of food and water to Madrid is now in our hands, but we have not yet cut it off. The panic of food shortage in Madrid has decreased due to the government's victory, especially the recovery of Albayete, because communication with Valencia has been restored. The western capital is now more stable than before, and all troops have set out to fight. Women loyal to the government are doing their best to organize a "company of female soldiers" to help men engage in war. In addition to defeating the rebels and causing them to retreat to Segovia, government troops have also gained control of the key points in the Guadarrama Mountains. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Barcelona: Saragossa City, the capital of Aragon province in the north, is still in the hands of the rebels. A people's militia of 8,500 men has been formed into three columns and are advancing on the city from different routes. The first column, with 3,000 men, is led by the anti-rebel leader and commander-in-chief of the workers' militia, Falla. After occupying Lerida City, they are moving up the Ebro River and have now reached the town of Mina, 35 kilometers from Saragossa City (along the Ebro River), forming the central route. The second column, totaling 2,000 men, set out from Tarragona City, first occupied Salinena City, and have now reached Tiedienta, 60 kilometers from Saragossa City, forming the northern route. The third column, totaling 3,500 men, is a mixed force composed of the 16th Infantry Regiment and artillery militia. After occupying Gasper City, they have now reached Alganis City, 50 kilometers from Saragossa City, forming the southern route. In addition, air force personnel are flying multiple aircraft to assist in the suppression, conducting bombing raids. It is reported that the rebel commander of Aragon province has telegraphed Yega and Huesca (both north of Saragossa City and in the hands of the rebels) for assistance. A fortress in Yega City has suffered significant damage after being bombed by aircraft. Huesca City is also surrounded by government troops, with white flags hoisted, but the rebels in both locations have not surrendered and are still resisting. Today is a holiday, and although the city is in the midst of war, members of the People's Front militia, either on foot or in cars, are parading through the streets, holding high the flags of their respective party groups and trade unions. However, everything appears as usual. The playgrounds are closed, and many citizens are visiting the site of the fierce battle that took place last Sunday to commemorate the ruins.

<p>Madrid: Regarding the current situation in Spain, the positions held by the government forces show slight progress, but the final outcome is still uncertain. According to government reports, the air force of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia flew to Palma, Majorca Island (in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean), and bombed the rebel forces there. Rebel leaders fled in small boats and were captured by submarine crew members loyal to the government. It is also rumored that General Gabanas, the rebel commander of Navarre province (near the French border), is in a dire situation. He has shaved his beard and changed his clothes to easily hide if necessary. Many of his rebel troops have fled into France. General Mola's rebel troops, the Northern Front commander, suffered 2,000 casualties in the Battle of the Guadarrama Pass, north of the capital. In Badajoz City in the west (near the Portuguese border), many right-wing leaders have fled into Portugal. Small groups of rebels, along with their wives and children, are entrenched in the nearby cities of Argalazai (southeast of the capital) and Toledo (south of the capital) and have not retreated. The People's Front party troops have urged them to surrender to avoid attack by government forces and to preserve the lives of their families. However, if the rebels refuse, they would rather die with their wives and children than surrender to government troops. As for Morocco in Africa, the government air force was ordered this afternoon to fly over Melilla and Ceuta and carry out bombings, inflicting heavy losses on the rebels. It is reported that they intend to abandon their original plan and no longer cross the Strait of Gibraltar. The Ministry of the Interior has also issued a statement saying that the government forces have defeated the rebels in various locations, and the situation has greatly improved today. It also stated that wherever the government forces go, the local people and the government air force can cooperate sincerely, so the results are very significant. In addition, the government bulletin has issued an order that retired military officers who have served the republican system effectively and have outstanding achievements can be reinstated to their original positions. The method of regulating food supplies in the capital has been designated and implemented by the governor of Madrid Province. All food and chemicals are prohibited from being exported, and export licenses that expire on July 31st are specially extended to remain valid. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The government announced in a broadcast last night that the government forces had won a victory in the Sumosan area (70 kilometers north of the capital), immediately occupied important positions, and sent multiple aircraft to pursue the rebels in the air with bombs. The rebel forces in Saragossa City in the north have been driven into a dead end and will soon be captured in one fell swoop. After the port of Palma on Majorca Island in the Mediterranean fell into the hands of the rebels, the government sent aircraft to bomb it, and the rebels there will soon surrender. Traffic between the capital and the southeastern provinces has been restored. A train of freight cars that left Valencia port arrived in the capital today. Passenger trains between the capital and Cartagena port, the capital and Cuenca City, the capital and Puertollano City, and between Barcelona City and Valencia port have also resumed normal service. Daily life in the capital has returned to normal since yesterday. A column of the People's Militia that was sent to Avila City (northwest of the capital) to suppress the Northern Front rebels returned yesterday, and the citizens welcomed them warmly. The Naval Department received a telegram from the captain of the warship "General Ferrándiz" regarding news from the rebel forces in Tetuan, Morocco, and emphatically denied the rumor that the ship had sunk. In addition, Minister of the Army General Miaja is scheduled to inspect the positions on the Guadarrama front in the north today. Other miscellaneous news is summarized as follows: (1) The security team of Castuera Village in Badajoz Province in the west, which had previously defected, has now returned to the government side. (2) Cartagena Port in the southeast, which was previously occupied by the rebels, has been captured by government troops after a fierce battle. (3) Colonel Villanueva, the commander of the first column under General Mola, the commander of the Northern Front rebels (one of the Carlist leaders), may surrender at any moment. (4) The "News" newspaper published a special issue stating that the government forces on the Guadarrama front behind the capital have begun to launch an offensive. (5) The newspaper also reported that the family members of Prime Minister Quiroga have returned to the capital from San Rafael City, passing through the rebel lines safely. (6) A train full of food arrived in the capital from the Eastern Province, and several truckloads of food arrived from Valencia City this morning. (7) The Ministry of the Interior issued a notice to all militia leaders that all members under the age of sixteen serving on the battlefield should be sent home. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Andaye, Southern France: It has been reported that General Gabanas, the rebel commander of Navarre province, has established a Provisional National Defense Committee in Burgos City, under the control of General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Front rebels. General Gabanas himself serves as the chairman of the committee, while Generals Zumalacárregui, Ponte, and Zúñiga serve as vice-chairmen. The committee exercises all political power, acting as a government. When a military dictatorship is established, it will hand over political power and send representatives to reside in foreign countries. The red and yellow colors are designated as the Spanish national flag, and the entire province of Navarre is now flying this flag. All other flags are prohibited. It is reported that the rebel forces in the province are currently advancing towards Pasajes City (on the coast of the Bay of Biscay) in the hope of gaining an outlet to the sea. If successful, traffic between Irún and Pamplona will be cut off, but the government forces are unlikely to concede, so a fierce battle is expected soon. Furthermore, the rebel forces in Loyola City near San Sebastian Port were surrounded and bombarded by government troops, but they broke through the siege and occupied the high ground around San Sebastian City. The sound of cannons is loud there, and a fierce battle is underway. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Rome) 1,500 refugees arrived here from Barcelona, and many of them described the tragic events in Spain, which have caused concern in the Vatican. They claimed that hundreds of technicians and nuns have been killed. Many nuns were stripped naked and thrown into the streets. A total of 18 churches have been looted. Mobs forced technicians and nuns to set fire to a church and then shot them with machine guns. In the town of Cariaga, the guerrilla troops dug up corpses and lined them up against the walls of a church, doused them with oil, and burned them, forcing groups of nuns to watch. Another group of nuns was shot in front of the altar for refusing to set fire to a church. A female doctor secretly sent a letter from Barcelona to London, stating that rebels were firing from churches at those loyal to the government, so the churches and monasteries were burned. The rebels also fired upon a Red Cross vehicle, and she was sitting in the vehicle at the time. They also fired on unarmed civilians gathered outside the post office. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid: According to a Reuters correspondent who recently arrived at Cerbère on the French-Spanish border from Barcelona, the historically valuable harbor there may face famine, even though it remains in the hands of those loyal to the government. The correspondent also described in detail the various tragedies in Barcelona, stating that the corpses of humans and animals were scattered throughout the streets, causing a pervasive stench that was unbearable. The correspondent also recounted that several rebel generals were hiding in a monastery, but were discovered by government troops and forced to surrender. However, the majority were killed, and none survived. One person had both feet cut off. All shops in Barcelona were looted. Many tram tracks have been destroyed. Except for a few churches and monasteries that have been converted into hospitals, all other places have been searched and robbed. Many anarchists set fire to the Church of Santa Ana, danced and rejoiced on the altar, and tore the image of Christ into pieces. The offices of the Italian shipping company have been looted and vandalized. As a result, the Governor of Catalonia, Companys, has ordered special protection for foreign property. According to the correspondent's observation, a 19-year-old girl led the newly formed Red Army, practicing with the men in a very agile manner. The British couple, Mr. and Mrs. Barton, arrived safely in Cerbère after experiencing terror in Barcelona. It is said that the Bartons were staying at the best hotel in the city. They were awakened by gunfire in the morning and discovered that the rebels were being attacked by government troops and had taken refuge in the hotel. Several rebels entered the Bartons' bedroom, told them to get up quickly, but did not allow them to change clothes. Then, the rebels fired back through the gaps in the windows until they were all shot dead. The Bartons lost all their money and luggage and arrived in Cerbère with only blood-stained clothes and leather shoes. According to a Reuters message from Lisbon, 80 nuns, one of whom was over 90 years old, have escaped from Vigo to Valpobus. Although they were tired from the journey, they insisted on first expressing their gratitude to God in the church of the monastery where they were staying before agreeing to rest.</p>
<p>(London) An Englishman arrived here today from Barcelona and claimed that almost all the cafes and grocery stores in the city had been robbed, and it was now very difficult to buy food and drinks. A Spaniard was hiding in the bedroom of an Englishman in a hotel, but was discovered by the crowd, who broke down the door and killed him in front of the Englishman. None of the churches in the city were intact. Many monks tried to escape in ordinary clothes, but were discovered and arrested because their boots were different from those of the general public.

<p>(Paris) Right-wing newspapers have been relentlessly attacking the government recently because Spain has purchased weapons from France. However, according to a report in the Communist Party newspaper L'Humanité, the former Spanish ambassador to France, Quinones de Leon (who served as ambassador during the reign of the deposed King Alfonso), purchased airplanes and automobiles worth 20 million francs from the Renault factory on behalf of the Spanish Fascist Party. Quinones issued checks to pay for the goods, and Renault has received the payment.

<p>(Paris) Le Temps recently published an article on the situation in Spain, expressing deep concern that the conflict in that country will have international repercussions. The article stated: "The situation in Spain is extremely confusing, and any attempt to interfere is extremely dangerous. The news coming out of that country is often contradictory. One side boasts of victory, while the other immediately dismisses it as lies. The location of real power is also unclear. Taking into account all the various circumstances, it appears that the power of the Republican government in Madrid extends only to a small part of the country, and even the extent to which it can exercise that power is limited by what the radicals will allow. These people volunteer to suppress the rebellion, and the government has no choice but to cooperate with them, so their strength is sufficient to control the government. The facts show that there are currently three power centers in Spain, which, although not yet clearly distinct, are undoubtedly independent. One is the government in Madrid, which is the current central government; the second is the government of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, whose president, Companys, controls all the radical groups; and the third is the rebel party, which recently formed a provisional government in Burgos City, chaired by General Cabanellas. As for those engaged in the civil war in the provinces, they can be roughly divided into the Red and White parties, but each party is also divided into various factions with different tendencies. The Red Party includes radical trade unions and far-left Republicans, while the White Party is made up of moderate Republicans, royalists, and the remnants of the "Carlist" party. The leader of the Carlist party is Prince Carlos, the legitimate heir to the throne, who is eighty-six years old. People initially thought that the remnants had long been wiped out, but in fact, they still exist. The Red and White parties are engaged in mutual slaughter, which is inhumane. Regardless of who emerges victorious, Spain is suffering a great calamity, and the division of power and mutual hostility will inevitably continue. It will be extremely difficult to achieve political stability and return to normalcy. As for the international implications and crises, since the recent talks in London between France, Belgium, and Italy, a glimmer of hope has emerged for a general resolution of European problems. However, the problems related to the western Mediterranean are vital to the lifeblood of England and France, and Spain also has a direct interest. If measures are taken carelessly, Germany and Italy will immediately seize the opportunity to exploit the situation. As for France, it is all the more necessary to strictly maintain neutrality. To ensure the safety of our country in the Mediterranean and in our North African colony of Morocco, it is essential to maintain friendly relations with both France and Spain. France has always maintained cordial relations with both past and present governments of Spain, and regardless of how Spanish internal politics may change in the future, the friendly relations between the two countries must be maintained."

<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning at 10 Downing Street, chaired by Prime Minister Baldwin, with Foreign Secretary Eden, First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare, and Home Secretary Simon in attendance. They discussed the situation in the House of Commons, which was scheduled to meet this afternoon, to prepare for it. It is generally believed that Foreign Secretary Eden will announce in the House of Commons that the British government has decided to revoke the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) In December of last year, when sanctions were imposed on Italy, Britain, based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, entered into mutual assistance agreements with countries along the Mediterranean coast (namely, France, Spain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia), providing guarantees to these countries that if they were attacked by Italy as a result of implementing sanctions, Britain would provide naval assistance. According to semi-official sources, Foreign Secretary Eden will announce this afternoon in the House of Commons that these guarantees should be revoked immediately. (It is reported that Italy demanded this as a condition for participating in the future Five-Power Conference.) Some sources also said that Britain may recognize Italy's new position in Abyssinia. Regarding this, the News Chronicle recently reported, "Anything that has already been seized in practice, even if legal ownership has not been obtained, is like building a mountain nine fathoms high and only lacking one basket of earth. The British government often accepts this principle and recognizes the missing basket of earth." The Morning Post reported that Foreign Secretary Eden's official announcement of the revocation of the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement would please Italy and induce that country to accept participation in the future Five-Power Conference. It is said that although sanctions have been lifted, the guarantees that Britain provided to the Mediterranean countries have been maintained because Italy still poses a threat in the Mediterranean. Italy has made assurances to the Mediterranean countries, stating that the alleged danger does not actually exist. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>San Francisco—The Pacific International Academic Society is scheduled to hold a conference at Yosemite National Park from August 15th to 29th. The issue of Japanese aggression against China will be the focus of discussion. From all perspectives, this conference will be one of the most important since the establishment of the society. Each national delegation will consist of 25 to 35 members, including government officials and university professors. Participating countries include China, Japan, the Philippines, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Although the United Kingdom is not a Pacific nation, many of its territories are related to the Pacific, so it will also participate. The Soviet Union's decision to participate for the first time is also quite important. Since joining the League of Nations, the Soviet Union has begun to interact with European countries. Now, by joining the Pacific Academic Society, it will also meet with representatives from Pacific nations for the first time. The League of Nations will also send observers to attend the conference as usual. The League of Nations observer for this session has been designated as Lange Lennox, the current director of the League of Nations Paris branch and an expert on Far Eastern affairs.

<h3 id="e79">Japanese Fleet Maneuvers in Fujian Waters; Drills to Be Conducted Near Xiamen; Japanese Warships Freely Enter and Exit Xiamen Port <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Seventy-two warships of the Japanese First and Second Combined Fleets will arrive in Xiamen on August 1st. It is learned that the combined fleet, commanded by Admiral Sankichi Takahashi, departed from Sasebo, Japan, arrived in Taiwan on June 27th, and left Taiwan on July 1st for exercises in the South Seas Mandate Territory. It is currently returning and is scheduled to arrive in Xiamen on August 1st. The exercises in the Fujian and Taiwan waters will also begin on August 8th. Naval Attaché Suga from the Japanese Consulate General in Fuzhou is scheduled to travel from the provincial capital by ship on July 26th and arrive in Xiamen on the 27th to prepare for the reception. Suga stated in a speech in the provincial capital, "The joint maneuvers of the Japanese Combined Fleet in the waters of Taiwan and Fujian are purely for tactical training, with naval students practicing long-distance naval operations, and have no special significance. The fleet is scheduled to host Chinese officials and gentry in Xiamen on August 2nd, and return to Sasebo on the 5th to their original defense positions. The maneuvers will include the First and Second Fleets, the Third, Seventh, and Eighth Squadrons, the First and Second Submarine Squadrons, and the First and Second Mine Warfare Squadrons, totaling more than seventy warships, as well as three aviation squadrons." Furthermore, Taro Yamada, the Japanese Consul in Xiamen, told reporters in Xiamen on July 23rd, "The First and Second Combined Fleets have more than seventy warships. Their arrival in Xiamen has no specific mission and is the same nature as the fleet cruising near Qingdao. The fleet will be stationed in Xiamen for four or five days and will conduct offensive and defensive exercises near Xiamen. After the exercises, they will return to their home country for defense. The fleet is commanded by Admiral Takahashi, followed by fourteen squadron commanders with the rank of Rear Admiral or higher. The largest ship in the fleet is the Nagato battleship, with a displacement of 35,000 tons." It is noted that the Japanese Combined Fleet previously visited Xiamen in 1924, commanded by then-Prime Minister Keisuke Okada, but it was only a cruise visit without any exercises, and there were only about thirty warships. This is the second visit in twelve years. When they arrived in Taiwan at the end of last month, the First Fleet had forty ships, entering Kelung Port, and the Second Fleet had thirty-two ships, entering Kaohsiung Port. The entire fleet had 60,000 officers and soldiers. The essence of the Japanese Navy is all gathered here. Furthermore, the large-scale exercises from the South Seas Mandate Territory to the waters of Taiwan and Fujian are a major demonstration to the South Pacific, and its significance is not limited to our country. However, our country feels it especially deeply. With such a large fleet conducting offensive and defensive exercises near Xiamen, its emphasis on Xiamen is also evident. Moreover, Xiamen is an important naval port and a fortress area of our country. In the past, when foreign warships came to Xiamen, the consul of that country would notify the Xiamen Fortress Headquarters a few days in advance. Since 1934, when Japanese warships come to Xiamen, they do not notify in advance and enter the port at any time, and often leave the port at night, breaking the rule that the Xiamen Customs prohibits all ships from entering and leaving before 6:00 AM and after 6:00 PM every day. Also, on the 12th of last month, seven Japanese destroyers arrived in Xiamen and conducted night combat exercises in the waters outside Xiamen from the 14th, entering and leaving Xiamen Port at night. Since then, the 16th ship of the Japanese Fifth Mine Warfare Squadron has been conducting exercises between Taiwan, Shantou, and Xiamen for one or two weeks. Japanese warships come and go freely at night, entering and leaving frequently, as if it were their own military port. Recently, Li Shijia, commander of the Fuzhou Mawei Fortress, and Lin Guogeng, commander of the Xiamen Fortress, have jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of the Navy, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Japanese ambassador so that Japanese warships will notify in advance when they come to Xiamen in the future. It is unknown what the outcome will be.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Yu Hanmou Arrives in Guangdong to Handle the Aftermath; Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters and the Fourth Route Army Headquarters Have Been Established; Military Restored to the Status Quo Before June 1st <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Jitang stepped down, the local military and police authorities have been maintaining public order. During this transition period, all groups and agencies are eager for the newly appointed Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, Yu Hanmou, to arrive in the province as soon as possible to take charge of everything. Yu initially planned to arrive in the provincial capital on the 22nd, but it was delayed until the morning of the 23rd. That morning, Yu, along with Li Xuhuan and Chen Mianwu, secretaries of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, Qian Dajun, director of the First Group of the Central Military Commission's Attendant's Office, Huang Zhenqiu, principal of the Aviation School, Tu Sizong, a division commander of the Central Army, and more than twenty others, traveled by three Central aircraft from Shaozhou to the province. More than twenty aircraft accompanied them. At 8:35 AM, they arrived at the Tianhe Airfield in Shipai, Guangzhou. In advance, troops from the First Division, military police, and police security teams were stationed around the airfield. Those who welcomed them from the military, political, party, and academic circles included Lin Yungai, Li Shuzong, Lin Shiqing, Fan Dexing, Zhang Zhiying, Chen Zhangfu, Huang Zhiwen, Huang Yanzhen, Zhang Guoyuan, Huang Renhuan, Zhou Jingzhen, Li Luchao, Deng Qingyang, Wen Zhongqi, Lu Kuangwen, Gan Jiehou, Zhang Da, Song Ziliang, Zou Lin, Tang Haian, and hundreds of others. Yu emerged from the No. 1201 aircraft and shook hands with each of the welcomers. He then took a car to the Yantang Military and Political School to rest. The Central personnel who came with him also went along. Later, Yu summoned the generals remaining in the province, including Lin Shiqing, Tang Haoqing, Li Shuzong, Miao Peinan, and dozens of others, at the military school and inquired in detail about the current situation in Guangdong Province. Li Shuzong reported on the public order in the provincial capital and the garrison situation of various armies. They dispersed at around 11:00 AM. On the same day, Yu issued a written statement, as follows: "This time, I flew to Nanjing to call for peace, to end the war and save the country, in order to implement the consistent principle of sincere unity and to face the national crisis together. In Nanjing, I met with several veteran gentlemen, received their guidance in person, and received the personal instructions of Chairman Chiang on all national salvation strategies. I immediately telegraphed to persuade the two Guangdong authorities to dispel their suspicions and resolve their disputes, to unite the national strength, and to resist the invaders together. Subsequently, I received a clear order from the Central Government, specially appointing me as the Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army. I could not refuse, so I telegraphed from Dayu to take office. I have spent half my life in the military and am content with simplicity. In this time of national crisis, I have long disregarded personal life, death, and safety. However, I cannot bear to see Guangdong, the source of the revolution, my hometown, fall into ruin, and the 30 million beloved fellow Cantonese people suffer eternal misfortune. Moreover, the revolutionary organizations that have struggled hard for more than ten years and the countless martyrs who have sacrificed, as well as the comrades-in-arms who have shared weal and woe for a long time, are deeply entrusted with my spirit and are closely related to me. How can I bear to see them all destroyed in one day? However, I believe that the interests of one individual are small, and the safety of the country and the nation is a great matter. Therefore, under the urging of the public, I resolutely accepted the order of the Central Government, telegraphed to return to the army, and cleaned up the Guangdong situation. I ask myself that I am straightforward in nature, and I have always adhered to the principles of impartiality, sincerity, kindness, and generosity towards people and things. I hope that the generals will continue to work together for many years and will be close and inseparable, and all will deeply understand the great righteousness and be able to entrust their hearts. At a time when the country is in trouble, we should share the same boat. Everything in the past can be put aside. We must all recognize the difficulties of the times, unite sincerely, and under the leadership of the Central Government's unified anti-aggression front, gather all our strength to defend the territory, pacify the local area, and seek a way out for the country and the nation, in order to repay the trust of the Party and the country and the hopes of the Cantonese people, and to fulfill the duty of a soldier. I have always been in awe of the clear warning that soldiers should not interfere in politics and harm the country. Today, I bear a heavy responsibility and feel even more frightened. In order to eliminate the bad habits of the past, I deeply wish to take the lead by example, not to ask about politics, and to focus on training the military for the use of the country. In the military aspect, we should first restore the status quo before June 1st, so that the hearts of the people in Guangdong can quickly stabilize. At a time when the country is poor and the people are impoverished, and the economy is in a state of recession, we should broaden our minds and vision and take the overall national strength and the lives of the entire people as the premise. I have always hoped to bring fewer soldiers, so that I can reduce one point of sin, which is to reduce one point of burden on the people and cultivate one point of vitality in the local area. Therefore, I strongly advocate that the financial affairs of this province should be the responsibility of the Central Government for consolidation, in order to conform to the original intention of complete and genuine unification. All people in Guangdong should clearly understand the Central Government's painstaking efforts this time and its determination to maintain the integrity of Guangdong and to prioritize the local people. We should not have private opinions and arbitrarily divide our territories. The Central Government will certainly be able to take into account the overall financial plan of the country and coordinate everything. We only need to help with consolidation in the spirit of consistent trust and cooperation from top to bottom, so that we can achieve full effect as soon as possible, to relieve the people's difficulties and to build national defense. This is the only way for the Cantonese people to turn danger into safety and the only way to save the situation. Our compatriots' revolutionary enthusiasm has long been known at home and abroad. At this critical moment of life and death, I believe that we can clearly understand the international environment, unite together, assist the government, strive to improve, jointly protect the territory, and forever maintain the reputation of the source of the revolution. I have always loved the words "practical" and "hardworking" the most, and I often use them to encourage myself, and I dare to use them to encourage my 30 million Cantonese elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts, to work together to create a new and self-reliant Guangdong."</p>
<p>After Yu arrived in the province, all sectors expressed their welcome. Yu also issued an announcement to reassure the people, exhorting the people to maintain peace and pacify the local area. He also consulted on military and local affairs for days in order to start consolidation. In order to pacify the local area and consolidate the military and government, the Guangzhou Pacification Commission Office was established as the highest authority. The former First Army Group Headquarters was changed to the Pacification Headquarters. The headquarters was divided into six sections: Staff, Secretarial, Adjutant, Military Supplies, Military Medicine, and Military Law, each with a Major General as the section chief, and a Lieutenant General as the Chief of Staff. The Fourth Route Army Headquarters was located at the former Mingde Society site on Nonglin Road in Dongshan. The headquarters was divided into Staff, Secretariat, Adjutant, Military Law, Military Medicine, Logistics, Political Training, and Military Reclamation sections. Luo Zicai was appointed as the Chief of the Staff Section, Li Xuhuan as the Chief of the Secretariat Section, Ma Binghong as the Chief of the Logistics Section, Zhang Jian as the Chief of the Military Medicine Section, and Xu Jingtang as the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>The 123rd Divisions of Yu's Fourth Route Army have been transported to the province for days. The First Division under Li Zhen is stationed in the suburbs of the provincial capital, the Second Division is stationed along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road, and the Third Division is stationed in the northern suburbs of the provincial capital, along the Yuehan Road to Xinjie. The divisions of the Second Army are stationed in the Xiaobei River and Xijiang Qing, and the Third Army is still stationed in the counties of Huizhou. The Fourth Army is stationed in Xingning, Fengshun, and Meixian. The defense areas of each army will not be adjusted in the short term. (July 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Smuggling in North China Slows Down Slightly; Customs Anti-Smuggling Efforts Intensified; Smuggled Goods to the South Have Disappeared <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Smuggled goods transported from Tianjin to the south have been cut off since the night of the 21st. This situation is partly due to the accumulation and sluggish sales of smuggled goods in areas south of Jinan, and partly because the Tianjin Main Station was detained by the Customs on the night of the 21st with a batch of smuggled goods heading south. The Ronin feared losses and automatically stopped transportation. On the night of the 22nd, although dozens of Ronin transported about 40 loads of yarn, sugar, and rayon to the East Railway Station, they feared that the Customs would detain them, so they transported them back to the Japanese Concession without waiting to load them onto the train. From mid-May, when the Ronin began to forcibly occupy the Jinpu Railway to go south, to a certain day, it lasted for more than seventy days. The Jinpu Railway estimates that the loss of reduced passenger transport due to ticket refunds is about 1,500 yuan per day. The loss of freight costs is more than 4,000 yuan. In the past seven weeks, the total loss reached more than 40 million yuan, and the indirect losses are not included. Regarding the smuggled goods seized on the 21st, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, at the request of the Ronin Trade Association, sent Commercial Vice-Consul Nagai to the Customs to visit Chief Tax Inspector Xu Liya to request their return. Xu refused, and Nagai did not insist on any claims and left. Due to the stricter enforcement of anti-smuggling efforts in recent days, the sea patrols are also operating normally. The Guanghao gunboat, which is stationed in Tanggu, is still cruising in Qikou and Dagu. As a result, the number of smuggling ships in this area has decreased. However, sailboats and small steamers are still constantly transporting goods from the Tuohekou area. It is learned that the Tianjin Customs has issued a vernacular notice to strictly block the import and export of smuggled goods, stating, "All citizens of the Republic of China should rise up to help the country and eliminate smuggling merchants. If you hear any news about smuggling merchants, hurry to report to the Customs area. After capturing the smuggled goods ship, the reporter will receive a reward. For example, if the auction is 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan will be given as a reward. If you have accurate information, you can tell the Tax Officer, Deputy Tax Officer, Inspector General, Deputy Inspector General, Head of the Customs Branch Office, or Captain of the Patrol Boat in person. However, the reporter must also keep the secret strictly." Since the posting of this notice, smugglers have become more cautious and no longer rampant. This is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>According to statistics for July to date, only 15,000 packages of smuggled yarn and sugar have been transported from Tianjin to the south. Due to difficulties in transportation earlier and interception by the Customs recently, there are currently more than 300,000 packages stockpiled in the Tianjin Japanese Concession, and more than 400,000 packages stockpiled in Dalian. In the past three months, the sales volume of yarn and sugar has been 56,000 packages per month, so based on the current stockpile, it will take at least half a year to sell them all. If the monthly sales are 30,000 packages, it may take no less than ten months to clear them all. Moreover, the prices are falling sharply. In this one item alone, the Ronin and smugglers have lost more than one million yuan in one week. From the Japanese perspective, smuggling is coming to an end. Its sales cannot continue to be rampant as they are now, and prices can only plummet and cannot rise. The losses of major Japanese industries and businesses are a hundred times greater than the private profits made by a few Ronin. Moreover, due to smuggling, domestic prices in Japan have fallen sharply, and commerce and industry cannot be maintained. It would be better to help crack down on smuggling so that large industries and businesses can trade legally. Therefore, they have recently shown remorse and are no longer supporting it. However, they do not want to stop there. They intend to use the crackdown as a bargaining chip. If we agree to slightly reduce tariffs, they will help ban smuggling. There is no doubt about it.

<p>Zhang Yundiao, a young man in his early twenties, a staff member of the county government's deed tax office, recently enjoyed learning to swim. Last Friday, he did not attend the morning exercise, which was quite strange to his colleagues. However, he stayed overnight at the county government, so his family did not find it strange. The colleagues at the county government thought he had returned home, so they also did not find it strange. On a certain evening, a naked male corpse was found in the inner city river behind the Catholic Church. After passing the word around, someone finally identified it as Zhang Yundiao. His body was swollen and his face was blurred. After notifying his family, they reported to the prosecutor's office to come for an inspection. It was heard that there were no signs of injury. It was likely that he had lost his footing while practicing swimming and drowned. However, it was quite strange that he was completely naked. His father, Zhang Polang, was very saddened when he heard the news.</p>

<p>The meat industry in Suzhou believes that since they have already paid the slaughter tax, they should not have to pay the business tax again. They have repeatedly argued, but have not been granted permission by the authorities. However, the industry is still arguing. The Wu County Business Tax Bureau believes that the industry intends to resist taxes, so it sent a letter to the county government requesting the arrest and detention of Jiang Kunqing from the Lao Zhenxing partnership and Chen Maoda from the Chen Sanzhen partnership. As a result, the industry was panicked and immediately convened a general meeting, appointing Zhang Zhiming, Xu Kunquan, Ni Shenan, and nine others as representatives to visit Chairman Cheng of the County Chamber of Commerce on the 27th, requesting that the bureau be urged to release the arrested Jiang and Chen and to find ways to guarantee their safety. Chairman Cheng then negotiated with the bureau, but regarding the business tax issue, the bureau insisted on collecting taxes in accordance with regulations. They are currently discussing solutions.</p>

However, due to financial difficulties, construction has not yet started. It is learned that the county government will work with the Qingpu County Government to conduct a detailed survey again in order to start construction as soon as possible. In addition to using the road construction tax donated by the two counties, a small amount will be requested from the province for subsidies.</p>

<p>The Silkworm Seed Industry Association of this county held a membership meeting yesterday and resolved: (1) The original autumn varieties Zhugui, Hangui, and Hua 5 were made in the spring and submitted to the Management Committee for approval to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. (2) The model area improvement institutes and various planting sites should be clearly explained to the Management Committee. (3) The trial site forwarded the association's telegram stating that silkworm seeds exported from this county to Zhejiang that do not meet 1,000 sheets must be supplemented to 1,000 sheets, otherwise they will be eliminated. The association will send a list by telegram to reply. (4) The Improvement Association will be asked to subsidize the seed money. The association's regulations stipulate that the autumn production volume should not be less than 50% of the spring production volume. The association will be responsible for purchasing 1.35 million spring seeds next spring. (5) The silkworm seeds exported from this county to other provinces will be discussed by Zhu Ruifang, Miao Shoujun, and Lu Zirong, and the results will be notified to each site. (6) All spring and autumn made spring seeds at each site in this county should be reported to the association after the autumn production is completed so that methods can be devised for comprehensive export at any time. It is heard that Jiangsu Province will produce a net total of 1.24 million sheets of autumn seeds this year. Jiangsu Province will allocate 800,000 sheets, and the remaining 440,000 sheets will be sold to Zhejiang Province. The female silkworm farming instructors in each district of this county will depart on August 5th to provide guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Changshu: Grain Tax Embezzlement Case Expanding <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The embezzlement case discovered by the County Government's Grain Collection Office has attracted attention from all parties. It has long been known that the collection office is rife with corruption. Although the Provincial Committee and others have come to Changshu to investigate thoroughly, they have ultimately failed to discover anything because of the internal unity. The current discovery involves Zhou Ruixin forging grain slips in the past, and now discovering the embezzlement of inventory slips. It is heard that this situation is entirely due to internal cracks. The currently detained Zhou Ruixin is the cousin of Zhou Zhiqing, the director of the West Counter. When it was first discovered, it was intended to be covered up. However, Deputy Director Gu Yansheng believed that this was the best opportunity for promotion, so he directly informed the head of the Second Section and had Zhou arrested and detained. Because Zhou, as the perpetrator, is not the only one involved, all the officers, big and small, on the counter have embezzled thousands of yuan, or at least hundreds of yuan. Now, they are sacrificing one person and intend to make everything public. At this point, everyone is terrified and has submitted their resignations, resulting in a stalemate. Therefore, in recent days, the relevant parties have been doing their best to run around and dredge the situation, hoping to bail out Zhou Ruixin, the forger of grain slips, first to silence him, so that the situation will not expand. However, according to the county magistrate, he is determined to thoroughly clarify the situation in order to resolve the long-standing and unbreakable accumulated malpractices in the grain tax.</p>

As a result, many tables, chairs, teapots, and cups were damaged. The manager of the opera house reported to the brigade headquarters. The next morning, the brigade headquarters identified six of the perpetrators and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. All losses will be compensated by Huang Renbo, the commander of the company.</p>

<p>Duan Guangrong, a resident of East Zhijie in Wu Township, held a wedding ceremony for his daughter, Mrs. Yu, on the 7th of this month at the Dacheng Hotel. However, when the bride was washing her face, the jewelry box she brought with her suddenly disappeared, containing gold bracelets and other jewelry worth more than 500 yuan. The Duan family immediately reported the case to the Public Security Bureau's First Branch for investigation and took the matchmaker, Mrs. Ding Sun, to the bureau for questioning. As a result, there were no leads. The Duan family then sent people to various pawnshops to inquire for days. On the 25th, two gold bracelets were found at the Jiheng Pawnshop, so they registered the loss and redeemed them. Then, on the 26th, a remaining ring was found at the Deyuan Pawnshop. When they went to register the loss, Feng Xiaomazi, a man from Haizhou living in Jianju Lane, happened to be holding a ticket to redeem the gold ring. Duan Guangrong questioned him about the source, but Feng could not answer. He immediately called the police and transferred Feng to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. They then searched his home. Feng's mother knew that things were not good and tried to throw the jewelry into the toilet, but it was found by the police in her stocking. Feng's mother, Chen, and others were taken to the bureau. After Duan Guangrong checked the items, three items, including the lock plate, were missing.

<p>The Xincang District Office recently dispatched officers to interfere with citizens going bare-chested. On the 23rd, a certain sauce garden initiated resistance, willing to sacrifice the entire town's commerce, vowing to fight for survival bare-chested. Agreement having been reached, a market strike was immediately initiated. Pawnshops also joined the battle, resulting in the poor having no money to pawn for a time, all bitterly scolding the authorities. Yesterday, the county government and county chamber of commerce sent people to persuade them, but to no avail. Today, the county party headquarters sent personnel to investigate. This morning, a phone call was made to inquire, but there was still no news of the market reopening.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Our Country's Delegation to Siam Returns, Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday Morning. Siamese Authorities' Attitude Cordial and Sincere, Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Support the Central Government, Rich Collection of Materials Awaits Sorting. <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Our country's delegation to Siam, a group of seven, led by head of delegation Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 6:00 AM aboard the French mail ship Aramis. They issued a written statement detailing the inspection process. Numerous representatives from various groups in Shanghai went to welcome them. A banquet was held last night to welcome them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Aramis berthed at 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Representatives from various groups went to welcome them in succession. Welcome flags were hung everywhere on the pier, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Those who arrived included Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, Zhao Tiezhang, deputy director, Wu Wentian, section chief of the Ministry of Industry's Labor Department, Liu Yunfang, secretary of the Municipal Council, Wu Yunzhai of the Bankers' Association, Zhang Peishen, Gu Chengan, Gu Huaibing of the National Federation of Commerce, Zhu Boyuan of the Municipal Higher Association, Wang Zhisheng of the China Industrial Federation, Chen Chengzhi of the Aviation Association, Pan Yangyao of the National Products Sales Association, Tao Leqin of the Taxpaying Chinese Association, representatives from the Civic United Association, the Chinese Red Cross, Jinan University, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, local associations, and relatives of the delegation members, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Delegation Members Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office negotiated with customs authorities, and all luggage was exempted from inspection. After the delegation members exchanged greetings with the welcomers, those who were not residing in Shanghai went to the New Asia Hotel to rest. The delegation members who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning included Ling Bing, head of the delegation, Lin Kanghou, deputy head of the delegation, Wang Zhixin, Ma Chaoyong, Liu Yiling, secretary, Xiong Dansun, and Ye Xiangfa, totaling seven people. Two delegation members, Liu Hou and Cao Yumin, remained in Saigon for inspection. Delegation member Yu Ming returned to his native Guangdong province to visit relatives. Others, such as Li Gan, Fang Zhizhen, Huang Tianjue, Yang Donglin, and Chen Chongkan, returned to the country earlier. The delegation plans to stay in Shanghai for one day and will return to the capital today to report on their mission.</p>
<p>Sorting Materials</p>
<p>The delegation brought back gifts from the Siamese authorities and overseas Chinese, numbering about seventy boxes, demonstrating the cordiality of Sino-Siamese relations and the deep love of the overseas Chinese. All the inspection materials will be compiled by the relevant delegation members, with a two-month period set aside for sorting after returning to the country. The content is divided into overseas Chinese affairs, economy, education, diplomacy, commerce, etc. In the future, in addition to reporting to the competent authorities, they will also be compiled into a book to report to the government. Regarding the development of Sino-Siamese commerce, according to delegation head Ling, they exchanged opinions with the authorities there several times, and the results were very good. Siam also hopes to work with our country to promote commerce. As for specific measures, they will be discussed after reporting to the government.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>The delegation issued a written statement saying, "Our delegation's trip to Siam began preparations in the autumn of last year. Due to various reasons, the departure date was delayed several times. It was not until May 26 of this year that we departed from Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Victoria, passing through Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Penang, and other places. On June 6, we arrived in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and stayed in Siam for a little over a month. At the beginning of July, we returned via Penang to Singapore and took the French mail ship Aramis back to the country via Saigon. Today, we arrived safely in Shanghai, deeply grateful for the concern and care of those who care about our delegation and friends from all walks of life. Now, we will describe the course of this trip and the impressions we have gained, as follows: The important task of our delegation is to connect national relations, comfort overseas Chinese, and at the same time inspect various undertakings in Siam. The reason is that in the summer of last year, the representatives of the Siamese People's Council had an organization for a Far East inspection tour to our country. Our government and people thought that reciprocity was a necessary etiquette between nations, so we organized this delegation to go and reciprocate. For nearly a hundred years, there have been no formal national relations between China and Siam. Neither side has established embassies or consulates. This is also an opportunity to allow the more than two million overseas Chinese in Siam to understand the current situation of the motherland and the necessity of government attention. Siam is located between French Indochina and British Burma, with a territorial area of approximately 200,000 square miles and a population of over 11 million. Among them, one-quarter are purely Siamese, one-quarter are purely overseas Chinese, and the rest, except for a small number of foreigners, are mixed Chinese-Siamese. This shows the deep relationship between China and Siam. This kind of special situation is rare in the world. Siam's products are mainly rice and wood. There are also many other products such as leather, catalpa, rubber, and tin. Among them, rice accounts for about half of the annual direct sales to Hong Kong and the interior of our country. The rest is mostly sold to British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, etc. In the final analysis, it is also consumed by the overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned places. Therefore, China and Siam not only have a very deep relationship in blood, but also have an inseparable trend in economy. Since Siam changed its government, the government authorities have been working hard to govern the country, and all measures have far-reaching plans, and all kinds of government affairs can be smoothly implemented, and the people are also full of vigor and vitality, and the future development is still promising. What is especially admirable is the spirit of the ruling authorities to strive for the country peacefully and their open and upright attitude. All discussions are extremely sincere and cordial. Although there have been no formal national relations between China and Siam in the past, the efforts of our ancestors over hundreds of years have made the national feelings harmonious, as close as brothers and sisters, not comparable to casual friends. Therefore, my colleagues' talks with the Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs, Economy, Agriculture, Education, and other relevant ministers are as direct as family members talking about family affairs, without adhering to customary etiquette. As for the results of the discussions, they still need to be formally reported to the government, and it is not yet time to release them. We cannot talk more about it at this time. What can be gratifying is that the delegation's trip has not failed its mission. Not only the goodwill of the Siamese government and people, but also the delegation's return, brings the goodwill of the Siamese government and people with it. Regarding comforting overseas Chinese, the delegation was instructed by President Chiang to convey his regards. After arriving in Siam, my colleagues went to various places to promote the domestic situation. Fortunately, the central government's prestige was deeply welcomed by the overseas Chinese. However, overseas Chinese in various places have not had envoys coming and going between the two countries for a long time. This trip by the delegation is the only one in nearly a hundred years. As a result, people along the north-south railway came out to meet them, young and old, just to see my colleagues, even waiting late at night, giving many treasures. The original intention of my colleagues was to comfort, but in the end, we troubled the overseas Chinese, which is very disturbing. However, it can also be seen that the overseas Chinese support the central government enthusiastically. As for the scope of inspection, it is very broad, especially focusing on internal affairs, diplomacy, education, and economic construction. Although the time is short and the manpower is limited, the collected materials are still rich. After sorting them out and reporting them to the government, we will select the best ones to publish to inform those who care about the delegation and to correct people from all walks of life."</p>
<p>Public Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Local Association, the Civic United Association of the First Special District, the Bankers' Association, the Aviation Association, the International Trade Association, and other twenty-nine public groups, held a public banquet for the delegation to Siam at the Bankers' Association Club on Hong Kong Road at 7:00 PM last night. Head of delegation Ling Bing, Deputy Head Lin Kanghou, and delegates from the delegation's secretariat and various public groups, including Hu Xiyuan, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaoji, Wu Yunzhu, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, Zhou Xuexiang, Wang Zhisheng, Pan Yangyao, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Manyun, Liu Shenying, Fang Yixian, and others, totaling over seventy people, attended. As the wine reached its peak, Chairman Wang Xiaoji stood up and gave a welcome speech, saying, "Today we welcome the delegation to Siam back to the country. This morning, representatives from public groups all went to the pier to welcome them, but still felt that it was not enough. Therefore, we have prepared a small amount of wine to cleanse the dust for the delegation and to express our respect. During the delegation's trip abroad, the domestic political situation changed. I believe that the delegation must have been very worried. Fortunately, the situation turned out very well, and the country has the hope of unification as a result. It can be said that we were afraid and happy at the same time. The delegation has worked hard for the country in the hot summer, which makes us admire them very much. Now, we invite the two delegation heads, Ling and Lin, to report on the inspection process." Amidst applause, head of delegation Ling gave a speech, saying, "Chairman, representatives, today we are very grateful for the enthusiastic reception from the public groups in Shanghai. The most important missions of our delegation's inspection in Siam are two: First, to connect national relations. China and Siam have had almost no national relations for nearly a hundred years. Neither side has sent envoys or consulates. Therefore, we felt very apprehensive when we set off, wondering whether the Siamese government would welcome us or not, and whether they were sincere. After arriving there, the Siamese government authorities were very sincere to us. After talking with them, we felt that the previous rumors about the Siamese government were too exaggerated. Another point that deserves our attention is that Siam is an emerging country. The responsible persons in the government are mostly ambitious young people. Although they may lack experience, they are full of vigor and have unlimited hope for the future. As for the national relations between China and Siam, from the perspective of race and economy, there is a natural alliance. In the future, if we send envoys and consulates to each other and treat each other with sincerity and goodwill, we will be brothers. Second, to comfort overseas Chinese. This trip by our delegation to Siam is the first time in nearly a hundred years that the government has officially sent representatives there. Therefore, the local overseas Chinese welcomed our delegation wholeheartedly, eager to see my colleagues. It can also be seen that although the overseas Chinese have been abroad for a long time, they still care very much about the motherland and protect the country. However, there is a weakness among the overseas Chinese, that is, they do not communicate with each other. Their group organizations are not sound, their will cannot be unified, and they even split into different factions and attack each other. This is the fatal wound of the overseas Chinese' future. Wherever our delegation went, we earnestly advised them to unite with each other and told them about all the current facilities of the domestic government to strengthen their feelings for the motherland," and so on. Deputy head of delegation Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying, "The delegation is jointly organized by officials and businessmen, starting with this one. Head of delegation Ling is an official, and I, as the deputy head, am a businessman. This inspection in Siam is not only a discussion between officials and businessmen, but also a division of labor and cooperation. All the inspection processes are being compiled into reports, which will be reported to the government first, and may be published publicly in the future. What I want to say to the representatives now are four feelings that arose after the inspection, which can also be said to be four hopes: (1) The fatal wound of the overseas Chinese, as head of delegation Ling just said, is their inability to communicate with each other. Therefore, the first hope is that the overseas Chinese can unite; (2) The older overseas Chinese in Siam mostly only speak dialects, while the younger people can speak Mandarin and have more advanced ideas. Therefore, we advise the overseas Chinese to set up more schools and promote education; (3) Most of the overseas Chinese in Siam are from Guangdong and Fujian provinces, but they inevitably have gaps after living in foreign lands for a long time. Therefore, we hope that they will also return to the country to take a look; (4) The promotion of national products in Siam is difficult because there are no formal national relations. For example, the same goods are suppressed due to different tax rates. Although there is a chamber of commerce in Siam, it has not been able to show its strength. In short, if we want to promote national products in Southeast Asia, the government must come forward to preside over it. I hope that head of delegation Ling can suggest this to the government after returning to the capital." The guests and hosts dispersed happily at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Investigation and Reply: The Accumulation Loan Silver Company Is As Such, Changed from Japanese to Portuguese Capital, Unable to Investigate Whether There Is Capital or Not <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The New Sound Society says that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and report in detail the internal situation of the Shanghai Citizens' Accumulation Loan Silver Company. The chamber has sent people to investigate and found that the Shanghai Citizens' Accumulation Loan Silver Company is located at No. 150 Guangdong Road. It was opened in May of this year. Initially, it was nominally a Japanese company, but in June it was changed to a Portuguese company. The company name was also changed to Shanghai Accumulation Loan Silver Company. The general manager is the Portuguese Remidice, and the Chinese manager is Zhou Shutang. Its business specializes in collecting money from the lower and middle classes, called the Public Savings Standard Society. According to Zhou, the company is registered with the Portuguese Consulate and has about two hundred members, mostly Class A members. The company's profits are seven yuan per month for each of the Class A and B groups, and fifteen yuan per month for the Class C group. It is currently in a trial period and has not yet officially opened. When asked how much capital it has and whether it is a Sino-foreign joint venture, he was tight-lipped. Observing the company's situation, it has just been opened, but the nationality name has been changed. Examining the license given by the Portuguese Consulate, there are signs of tampering. It seems to be mixed with another company's license. The existence of Japanese capital cannot be investigated. It is said that the chamber has reported it to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>And the Trade Status of the Two Countries</p>
<p>The New Sound Society says that since the Iranian state (i.e., Persia) upgraded its consulate in Shanghai to a consulate general and took charge of foreign affairs, it has been striving to strengthen Sino-Iranian relations. Now, the Iranian Consul General Osdoman will be transferred back to his country in accordance with the regulations of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A reporter from the New Sound Society visited Mr. Osdoman at the consulate general and received the following interview:</p>
<p>Returning Home as Usual</p>
<p>Mr. Osdoman first said, "The regulations of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs are roughly similar to those of your country. Diplomats abroad cannot serve for more than five years. Those who have stayed abroad for five years should return to Tehran (the Iranian capital) to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for one year in order to understand the domestic and foreign diplomatic situation before taking up posts in other countries." Mr. Osdoman also said that he had served as a consul in India for three years, and then came to Shanghai to establish a consulate, which was promoted to the first consul general in February of this year. He has been stationed in China for almost two years. He is about to return home soon. His successor as consul general will leave Iran for Shanghai soon. In order to further strengthen contact with our country and intensify work, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially dispatched a secretary to Shanghai to assist the affairs of the Consulate General.</p>
<p>Setting Up a Bureau in This City</p>
<p>The Iranian Ministry of Economy has three departments: Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture. The Commerce Department plans to set up trade bureaus in Europe, America, and Asia to facilitate increased foreign trade. In addition to setting up one bureau in Europe and America each, two special bureaus will be set up in Asia. One of the Asian bureaus has already established a general office in Mumbai. The bureau includes Iran's trade with India, China, Japan, and other countries. The Ministry of Economy has specially appointed Mr. Oweysi, an important official of the ministry, to be in charge of Far East trade. Mr. Oweysi is entrusted with the mission of representing the Iranian Imperial Government's commercial commissioner. He will come to Shanghai soon to handle trade with China and will establish a trade bureau in this city.</p>
<p>Handling Trade</p>
<p>Mr. Osdoman also talked about trade between China and Iran, saying that the goods that Iran transports to our country for sale should be mainly cotton, wool, cigarettes, dried fruits, wines, iron, acids, and flour. It is said that buyers have been found for iron acids and flour, and the goods will be transported to Shanghai soon. The goods that our country transports to Iran should be mainly silk and tea (these two items have long been important trades between China and Iran), porcelain, embroidery, and other luxury goods. Mr. Osdoman finally said that China is now tending towards true unification under the leadership of General Chiang, and there will definitely be new developments in everything. He hopes that China will also establish a trade bureau in Iran in order to further enrich the commercial friendship between the two countries.</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Yangtze River Water Recedes. This Year, We Can Avoid Floods. Farmland Along the River and Lakes Are Ripe. <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In previous years, at this time, the Yangtze River water level between Hankou and Xunyang was at least forty-seven or forty-eight feet. The farmland along the river often suffered from flooding. Because the river rose and the beaches were submerged, the route along the shallow banks of the river was unclear for ships sailing upstream and downstream, often mistakenly entering farmland. The Taikoo Anqing Wheel's accident last year was due to this reason. Therefore, during the flood season, the Yangtze River navigation industry is always wary. Mr. Chen Yukun, owner of the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangshun steamboat, said to reporters after returning to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this year have reversed the usual summer pattern of previous years. The water level in Hankou and Jiujiang has been decreasing day by day, with the maximum being less than twenty-nine feet, a decrease of about twenty feet compared to last year. The water in Dongting Lake has also decreased, and the farmland in more than twenty counties around the lake is celebrating a bumper harvest. The farmland along the river in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces has also had a large harvest of rice and grains due to the shallower water, which is rare in the past twenty years. Because the water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has decreased, the upstream and downstream ships have been spared from going the wrong way or running aground. From this, we can infer that the Yangtze River area can avoid floods this year. However, the Qingtianshi section of the Yangtze River near Tongzhou has only twenty to fourteen feet of water at the deepest point due to the low river level. The sandy beaches are interspersed, causing all the heavy-laden ships to run aground, making navigation very difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e104">National Sugar Production and Sales Association to Be Established Next Month on the First; Inaugural Board Meeting Held Yesterday, Elected Feng Rui as Chairman <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of improving sugar quality, increasing sugar production, and promoting sales, national sugar manufacturers have formed the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association. A meeting of initiators was held recently, drafting articles of association and electing directors. After submitting to the relevant ministry for approval, the inaugural board meeting was held yesterday. Feng Rui was elected as chairman, Huang Jiangquan and others as executive directors, and the association's establishment was set for August 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Election of Directors</p>
<p>Since factories were established in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to refine sugar using new methods, and Sichuan province is also actively progressing, China's sugar industry has seen improved quality and increased quantity. To consolidate the foundation of the national sugar industry and seek cooperation in production and sales, various manufacturers initiated the establishment of the National Sugar Production and Sales Association. Members include six Guangdong sugar factories, one each from Guangxi and Shandong, and the Sichuan sugar factory preparation office. On the sugar merchant side, there is the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association and its 53 members. A meeting of initiators was held recently, drafting articles of association and electing fourteen directors including Feng Rui. These actions have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Origin of the Organization</p>
<p>The original text regarding the origin of the association states: "Sugar is one of the necessities of life. Our country's annual sales require 20 million piculs, mostly reliant on foreign sugar in the past five years, resulting in an outflow of no less than 200 million yuan annually. A country's economy is like the lifeblood of a person; constant outflow inevitably leads to depletion. Aware of this, the government has specially increased import tariffs to revive the national sugar industry and prevent the overflow of profit rights. At the same time, it is also the only opportunity for our sugarcane farmers and sugar merchants to revitalize their businesses. In recent years, the national sugar production has been increasing year by year and month by month. Given time, it can become self-sufficient. While national sugar is gradually reviving, the enemy is urgently plotting to destroy us with endless tricks. Recent examples include strengthening smuggling and pressuring for tax reductions. If we do not rise up and resist, the grand plan for the revival of national sugar will inevitably be destroyed, and we will become their prey. At this critical juncture, it is the time for the survival of national sugar. Seize the moment; a slight delay will be lost. Only through painful self-awareness and urgent action can all of our national sugar producers and sellers unite, without distinction, and support each other. Therefore, in response to the needs of the times, this association is specifically organized to use collective strength to seek the development of national sugar, to live up to the government's intention to save the country through production, and to maintain our own interdependent survival. The people's livelihood and the national economy all depend on it."</p>
<p>First Meeting</p>
<p>The elected directors took office yesterday, and the first meeting was held at 3 p.m. at the association's office on Min Guo Road. The directors present were Feng Rui (represented by Lin Yi), Huang Jiangquan, Shen Zhennan (represented by Huang Baoqiu), Yuan Liang (represented by Lin Qunyi), Lu Zuofu (represented by Zhang Shen), Shi Yulin, Zheng Zenan, Zheng Yizhou, Chen Yuren, Yang Wenshao, Jiang Yachen, Lang Guangrui, and Chen Xinfu, a total of fourteen people. The meeting proceeded as scheduled, and Feng Rui was publicly elected as the interim chairman. After delivering a report, it was resolved to elect Feng Rui as chairman, and Huang Jiangquan, Zheng Zenan, Lang Guangrui, Yang Wenshao, Zheng Yizhou, and Chen Yuren as executive directors. It was also resolved to establish three groups under the board of directors: General Affairs, Affairs, and Finance. Lin Qunyi was appointed as the director of General Affairs, Zheng Zenan concurrently as the director of Affairs, and Shi Yulin concurrently as the director of Finance. The inaugural meeting is scheduled for August 1st at the Sugar Trade Association on Fuyou Road in the Nanshi district. An telegram has been sent to Guangdong requesting Feng Rui to come to Shanghai to attend, and invitations have been sent to various sectors to participate in the ceremony. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Key Points of Association Affairs</p>

<p>The Guangdong Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry was abolished by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee in April last year. Now that the situation in Guangdong has stabilized, the focus should be on enhancing the export of domestic products from South China to promote the development of domestic trade. Therefore, plans are underway to restore the organization of the Guangdong Commodity Inspection Bureau. Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Cai Wuji has been ordered to Guangdong to take charge of the planning. After receiving the order, Mr. Cai left Shanghai for Beijing a few days ago to consult with the Ministry of Industry on all related matters. It is now learned that Mr. Cai has agreed on the entire plan in Beijing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight to prepare for his trip. He will leave Shanghai for Guangdong in early next month to carry out the preparatory work. It is reported that after Mr. Cai goes to Guangdong, the Guangdong Commodity Inspection Bureau will be restored and established in mid-next month, and it is said that Mr. Cai will concurrently serve as the director.

<p>The Salt Affairs Audit Office Handles the Aftermath Peacefully</p>
<h3 id="e111">Aftermath of the Daishan Salt Riot <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Following the Daishan salt riot in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, the Salt Affairs Audit Office was very concerned. In addition to immediately sending Zhang Zhong, director of the Tax Police Bureau, to Daishan to investigate, Yu Bingxun was also appointed as the director of the Daishan Weighing and Distribution Bureau and concurrently as the head of the Daishan Salt Field to handle the aftermath. According to a reporter from the China Times News Agency, the incident was caused by a misunderstanding among the salt farmers of Daishan regarding the management of salt piles. The establishment of salt piles was due to the fact that the Daishan salt fields were very disorganized, and management and tax collection were not well-organized. Therefore, it was recently planned to build a salt pile next to each field to facilitate management. On the 13th of this month, surveyors were sent to Daishan to conduct measurements, but the salt farmers, unaware and without asking about the reason, beat and insulted the surveyors. Later, the salt police from the Weighing and Distribution Bureau went to rescue them, leading to a conflict that angered the local salt farmers. More than 2,000 people gathered, carrying new-style firearms, dry firewood, kerosene, and other items, and rushed to the Weighing and Distribution Bureau, setting it on fire. Twelve salt affairs personnel were brutally murdered, their stomachs cut open and filled with stones before being thrown into the sea. The rumor that more than a hundred salt farmers were killed or injured, and that the salt police were harsh on the salt farmers, may not be accurate. The local salt farmers are very fierce, and the salt police fear them like tigers. It is heard that the fish and salt tax in Daishan is only 20 cents per picul, which is vastly different from the Shanghai salt tax of 7.2 yuan per picul. Currently, the Salt Affairs Audit Office is handling the aftermath of the Daishan salt riot by peacefully guiding the Daishan salt farmers and actively reorganizing the local salt fields.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Japanese Textile Mills in Shanghai Buy Up Spindles from Two Factories <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Japanese merchants are constantly pushing forward with their attempts to expand the raw material market for the textile industry in China. Most of the Chinese-owned textile mills in North China have been bought and reorganized by Japanese merchants to establish a textile industry foundation in northern China, leaving a few Chinese merchants struggling under severe threat from Japanese merchants. A reporter from the Dagon News Agency learned from the Shanghai textile industry yesterday that the Tongchang Textile Mill at the Youche Wharf in Nanshi and the Zhenhua Textile Mill at the end of Lan Road in Yangshupu, which had announced their closure last year due to financial difficulties, each had more than 15,000 spindles. The largest of the Chinese-owned textile mills, the Japanese-owned Naigaiwata Textile Mill, recently bought all the internal machinery and spindles of these two factories. After rearranging and dismantling them, they will be allocated for use within the factory. According to a textile industry magnate, Chinese-owned textile mills are already in dire straits and unable to escape being competed against by the Japanese. If there is no practical way to provide relief, Chinese-owned textile mills will all go bankrupt within two years. He hopes that the authorities will provide substantial assistance during this critical period to help reverse the impending collapse of the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Zhejiang Antimony Mine Officially Opened <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Qian Xichan and Others Initiated the Organization</p>
<p>Organizing the Jincheng Antimony Mine Company</p>
<p>China has the richest antimony reserves, accounting for about 70% of the world's antimony production. Twenty years ago, the demand for antimony in the British and American metal industries increased daily, and the price of antimony rose from 200 yuan to 1,300 yuan per ton. Those who mined antimony in Hunan earlier were able to obtain huge profits. In recent years, Hunan's antimony production has reached 20,000 to 30,000 tons per year, worth 10 to 30 million yuan. The lives of 300,000 Hunan villagers depend on antimony mining. As a result, antimony in Hunan is not only a major part of Hunan's production but also the most famous antimony-producing area in the world. At the same time, Chinese people have seen the great profits to be made in the antimony industry, and the number of people searching for and mining antimony has gradually increased. Unfortunately, antimony-containing mountains in China are not easy to find, and there are none besides Hunan. For more than a decade, only western Guangdong has had some minor discoveries, but production is very small. In 1934, a very rich antimony mine was discovered at Jingzhou Town in the Huizhou region, on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. With the approval of the Ministry of Industry, Chinese people used indigenous methods to mine it on a trial basis for two years, confirming that the quality was excellent (above 70 degrees) and the quantity was abundant (above 30 metric tons). This year, foreign technicians were hired to work day and night, and two antimony veins were found successively. The antimony quality is 70 degrees, which is higher than Hunan antimony. However, due to imperfect personnel organization, the 10,000 yuan invested did not yield optimistic results. Now, Qian Xiqiao, a prominent figure in Hangzhou's political circles, has taken the lead in inviting foreign mining experts to continue mining. A fund of 60,000 yuan has been raised to formally establish the Jincheng Antimony Mine Limited Liability Company. Lockman, the inventor of the fire extinguisher, has been hired to provide technical and personnel assistance and to serve as a standing member of the preparatory committee. A business office and transportation office have been established in Shanghai to conduct planned mining. It is expected that a minimum of five tons of goods can be shipped daily in the short term. In that case, in addition to Hunan antimony and Guangdong antimony, there will be Zhejiang antimony for export.</p>

<p>The Tianxing Silk Weaving Factory in Sanxingfang, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, has been operating for many years. In the past, it was still able to make a profit, so the factory's operations were also developing day by day. Last year, due to the social recession, and this year even more so due to the impact of smuggling in North China, business has declined sharply. It had already reduced workers' wages by 20% in February of last year, but it was still difficult to maintain. On May 20 of this year, it announced a suspension of operations, stating that it was waiting to change the weaving machine patterns before resuming work. However, it has been more than two months and there has been no sign of resumption. Although it has issued two food allowances of five yuan per worker, it has been a long time, making it difficult to maintain a livelihood, and the situation is becoming more difficult. Yesterday, representatives Jiang Lianfang, Sun Sihai, Tan Cao Yi, Jiang Hongshan, and others, prepared documents and submitted them to the Party and government agencies, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume work immediately to maintain livelihoods.</p>

<p>Niu Yongjian, President of the Examination Yuan, along with local elites Shang Yibangyan, Yan Qi, Zhang Jingye, Niu Changyao, Zhu Hange, and others, are currently planning to build Ping Shan Park between Beiqiao and Yutang. The public notice states: After reading through local gazetteers, although there are many high mountains and lofty ridges in the world, they are all stone or earthen mountains, and there is no mountain named after a bottle except for our Shanghai County. It is said that in the Jin Dynasty, Ping Shan, the Internal History, was originally the village of giants. When Yuan Shan Song, a pirate, captured him, he kept a wine bottle, which accumulated into a mound and became the name. According to the old stele, during the Five Dynasties, Qian Yuqiu was good at leading Sichuan soldiers and ordered his soldiers to carry a tile bottle filled with water to prevent thirst. The army traveled to the village of giants and found a well with extremely sweet and delicious water. The soldiers scrambled to drink, and their bottles became empty and were discarded there, accumulating into a mountain. After the mountain was formed, the well was lost and could not be found. Later, the well was discovered on the bank of the Yutang River, and it was said that this well was moved by heaven. In front of the mountain, there are two ancient ginkgo trees with trunks that can be embraced more than ten times, said to be over a thousand years old. In the past, someone sawed one of them, and when the saw reached about a foot, blood suddenly spurted out, so they stopped. Today, there is still a scar about a foot long, shaped like a pine board patch, and people commonly call it "pine branch patched ginkgo." The stone lions, such as Dujiaoshan Gate, are all famous historical sites. In the past dynasties, grand Taoist temples were built here and were greatly renovated during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty and the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty. The pavilions and towers were magnificent for a time. Unfortunately, over hundreds of years, things have changed, and the place has become overgrown with thorns and is about to be abandoned. The Yutang People's Education Center, for research and experimentation, and to calculate the number of people who are disturbed and spend money, together with enthusiastic local people, have established a Ping Shan branch here. Since Shanghai was opened as a port, government buildings have been built densely, roads crisscross, and transportation is convenient. For the establishment of new facilities, we earnestly use the greatest strength. Ping Shan is close to the new county, so build a park here, plant flowers and trees, and equip bathrooms, reading rooms, dormitories, libraries, and clubs separately to guide the opening of a new era. We hope everyone will come to support and witness its completion soon.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Private Purchase of Treasury Bonds, Losses Borne by the Bank: Hua An Bank's Fang Chuanxun Accused of Breach of Trust for the "Wonderful Method" of Personal Gains and Bank Losses <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Fang Chuanhong (also known as Fang Su'an), a managing director of Hua An Bank (and owner of the An Kang Money Exchange on Houma Road), was sued in the First Special District Local Court by shareholders Ding Zhixian, represented by lawyers Yang Ruinian, on criminal charges of breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, the judge held a court hearing. According to the plaintiff, Hua An Bank has a total capital of 500,000 yuan, of which he owns ten shares, accounting for a capital of 1,000 yuan. Last summer, when the defendant was the auditor, he purchased 50,000 yuan of customs treasury bonds. Later, seeing the market price fall, he requested the bank's general manager, Ye Jingliang, to approve the transfer of the 50,000 yuan treasury bonds to the bank's purchase, causing the bank to lose 593 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen. The plaintiff accused the defendant of this kind of clever behavior of personal gains and bank losses, which clearly constitutes a breach of trust. Therefore, in order to protect the original capital, he has filed a request for mediation with the civil court. Because the defendant did not attend the mediation, it was unsuccessful. Therefore, he filed a criminal lawsuit. The defendant, Fang Chuanxun, denied that there was a breach of trust. Judge Xiao believed that the civil issue should be resolved first, and then the criminal issue could be addressed, so he immediately ruled to suspend the trial and ordered the plaintiff to first file a civil lawsuit with the civil court to await further action. In addition to Ding Zhixian, Li Shanxiang, another shareholder of Hua An Bank, has also entrusted lawyer Wu Kaisheng to sue Fang for breach of trust in the First Special District Court. It is reported that the trial will be held soon.</p>

<p>Lu Laoqi, also known as Wenying, the queen of flower associations, was arrested by the French Concession Police on December 5th of last year and brought to the Special No. 2 Court. She was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1,500 yuan. She posted a 6,000-yuan surety and was released pending appeal. Dissatisfied, Lu appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which revised the sentence to one year and six months in prison. The fine remained as originally imposed. After the final judgment, she was sent from the Third Branch of the High Court to the Fifth Criminal Division on the 25th of last month to begin her prison sentence for the disorderly conduct case. Yesterday at noon, Judge Zhu HuanKui from the Third Branch of the High Court arrived at the Fifth Criminal Division and ordered the arrest of Lu Laoqi to execute the fine. He asked Lu when she would pay the fine. Lu replied that she was unable to pay the full amount at once and could only pay in installments. The judge rejected this. Lu asked if she could wait until after her prison term to find a way to pay. The judge said no, and warned that if she did not pay the fine, her guarantors' shops would be seized. Hearing this, Lu looked worried and said despondently that she would rather serve time in lieu of the fine. The judge replied that was not possible; the state would not provide free meals in prison. He gave her three days to raise the full amount of the fine, or the shops providing her surety would be seized. After Lu repeatedly begged for an extension to find a way to raise the money, the judge granted her request, giving her seven days to pay the fine. The bailiff took Lu away and returned her to prison.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Western Paint Industry Association Sues Le Zhenbao et al., Continued Hearing Postponed Due to Plaintiff's Absence <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association passed a resolution after eighteen meetings of its committee members, appointing Ma Shangjie as its legal representative. They hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Le Zhenbao, the Ningbo native owner of Taichang Woodware Store at 740 Nanjing Road, Bei Runsheng, the Suzhou native former manager of Ruikang Paint Store residing at No. 5 Baoan Lane, Beile Road in the French Concession, Zhang Lanping, the Suzhou native current manager of Ruikang Paint Store, and Le Gengrong, the manager of Hengli Bank on Tianjin Road, for breach of trust, embezzlement of public property, and concealment of evidence. The lawsuit stated that in the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign, the nine industries, including Shanghai Western Woodware, Foreign Goods, General Merchandise, Foreign Firms, Runners, Piece Goods, Glass, and Hardware, jointly established the Nine Industries Guild at Dongxinqiao Street. The four defendants were elected to handle the affairs of the guild. The various industries contributed funds to purchase land and build houses for production. Profits steadily increased, accumulating assets of over 500,000 yuan. The defendants, conceiving a plot, fraudulently changed the Nine Industries Guild to the Foreign Goods Commercial Association, then to the Zhenxin Club, and finally to the Renyi Shanhui, intending to erase the property rights of the nine industries. The lawsuit requested legal investigation. According to the lawsuit, Judge Chen Shuoying held a court hearing and summoned the defendants. However, because the defendant Bei Runsheng was ill and did not appear, and because the case was complex, the defendants were instructed to submit a written defense and wait for a new hearing date. This information has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, another hearing was held, but the plaintiff representative Ma Shangjie and the lawyers were not present. The defendants Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, and Le Gengrong arrived with their defense lawyers Wu Linkun and Yan Yinwu to await the hearing. Bei Runsheng stated that the association was established by various industries in the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign and was originally named the Foreign Goods Commercial Association, not the Nine Industries Guild. He also stated that he left his position as manager of Ruikang several years ago. Their defense lawyers submitted the guild's inscription, the business license, and the name registry to the court and requested a detailed investigation. Because the plaintiff was not present, the court could not proceed with the trial and adjourned the session to await the plaintiff's appearance at a later hearing.</p>

<p>Qi Runpu, a Ningbo native and the manager of Xiaoyao Ballroom at 377 Xizang Road, residing at No. 211 Jingye Lane, Xinzha Road, withdrew 323 yuan in national currency from the accounting office as police dues and notification fees at 4:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, placing it in a leather bag to pay to the Municipal Council the next day.

One of them punched Qi's glasses, causing them to break and injure his eye. At the same time, the others suddenly snatched the leather bag from Qi and scattered in different directions. Qi and Du chased the attackers to the entrance of the YMCA on Jingansi Road, where they managed to apprehend one of them, identified as Zhao Liang, a Suzhou native. They handed him over to Chinese police officer No. 3839 Jinghua and he was taken to the Xinzha Police Station.

As he left Xiaoyao, the plaintiff punched him in the back. He fought back, breaking the plaintiff's glasses, but there was no robbery. Qiang Yongming completely denied the accusations. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the testimony and ordered the case to be continued at a later date, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Boy Zheng Jizhai, from Shaoxing, 11 years old, dark complexion, sunken eyes, thin and short build, shaved head, wearing a blue striped cloth short shirt, red checkered cloth pants, green sneakers, no socks. He went missing on July 18 from the entrance of his home at No. 8, Chang'an Fang, Xiejiao Jumen Road, South City. Now, searching everywhere has been fruitless. His parents are restless day and night and suffering from mental disorders. If any kind-hearted person can find him or provide information leading to his recovery, uniting the family, they will be immensely grateful and provide a small reward.</p>

<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(4) Egg Tax Rates Egg Categories</p>
<p>Tax rates were quite low in the past. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance revised the tax rate to 7.5% ad valorem, an increase of 1-2 times compared to the past. Subsequently, the government, showing consideration for the difficulties of merchants, revised it to 5% ad valorem on May 25th of the 22nd year of the Republic, with preserved eggs and salted eggs charged 50 cents per thousand pieces. In June of the 24th year of the Republic, the export tax rate was reduced by half again. However, due to financial difficulties, although formally announced, it has not actually been implemented. Now, the latest customs valuations for eggs are listed below (tax rate 5% ad valorem):</p>
<p>Various countries have built high tariff barriers for egg products. The US import tax is over 100% of the value, with dried eggs taxed at 27 cents per pound. Germany implemented new tariffs in the 21st year of the Republic, charging 65 marks per 100 kilograms for frozen whole eggs and frozen egg yolks, equivalent to 90% ad valorem. Fresh eggs increased from 5 marks to 70 marks per 100 kilograms, equivalent to 100% ad valorem. On May 15th of this year, France suddenly reduced the special tax on eggs, such as egg whites and egg yolks, from 280 to 150 per 100 net kilos… The current British tax rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Shell Eggs</p>
<p>(1) No more than 14 pounds per 10 dozen	Tax 1 shilling</p>
<p>(2) More than 14 pounds but not more than 17 pounds per 10 dozen	Tax 1 shilling 6 pence</p>
<p>(3) Over 17 pounds per 10 dozen	Tax 1 shilling 9 pence</p>
<p>Shelled Eggs (per pound)</p>
<p>(1) Liquid or frozen (whole yolk or whole white, including honey)	Tax 1 pence</p>
<p>(2) Dry Whole Egg	Tax 2 pence</p>
<p>(3) Egg Yolk	Tax 1 pence</p>
<p>(4) Dry Egg White	Tax 2 pence</p>
<p>(5) Export Situation In addition to domestic consumption, most eggs are shipped to various countries, a history that spans sixty years. Initially, only fresh eggs were exported, exclusively to Japan, with annual exports below 100,000 customs taels. Since the prevalence of egg products, export quantities have increased year by year. With the rise of frozen eggs, the sales of fresh eggs and egg products have declined. This can be seen from the export types in the 24th year of the Republic:</p>
<p>The primary destination for egg exports is the United Kingdom, followed by the United States and Germany. Since promoting chicken farming, Japan has shifted from import surplus to export surplus. In the 17th year of the Republic, Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese company in Shanghai, shipped over a hundred boxes of egg samples to Japan and peddled them to Chinese egg factories. Denmark and Poland produce many eggs, making them the only strong rivals in our overseas market. Many British colonies also produce eggs, so the United Kingdom is very wary of our egg sales and is vigorously promoting the poor quality of our egg products, demanding that the government impose heavy taxes or prohibit imports. Germany's implementation of economic controls and the US imposition of tariffs to resist Chinese eggs have been effective. The export numbers for each country in the 24th year of the Republic are compared below:</p>
<p>The egg export market previously centered on Tianjin, but now Shanghai is the hub. The export volume ratio by export location in the 24th year of the Republic is analyzed below:</p>

<p>Ancient Helmet Prize Most Valuable</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Berlin, July 26) The most unique and valuable prize at this World Games is the one awarded to the marathon winner. This prize is an ancient helmet, recently discovered near ancient Olympia. It is believed to be from the 6th century BC. Although it has been around for a long time, the helmet is still well preserved. According to experts, this helmet is of great value to ancient studies. This helmet is a gift from the director of a Greek newspaper, so a silver shield will be engraved with a commemorative inscription inside the helmet.</p>

<h3 id="e177">World Games Torch Passes Through Bulgaria to Yugoslavia Church Bells Ring in Unison Before Bulgarian Prime Minister's Office Reaches Disputed Area Between Two Countries After 23 Hours <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Sofia, July 36) The World Games torch, carried from ancient Olympia to Berlin, arrived here this morning. It has been widely welcomed and celebrated by the public here, as in other places. Before dawn today, the torch bearers reached the Catholic church in front of the Prime Minister's Office. An altar was built in front of the church, and a lamp was specially set up on the altar to light the torch. The Prime Minister led all cabinet members to wait respectfully on the scene. When the torch arrived, the Mayor of Sofia lit the lamp on the altar, and then the church bells rang in unison. Airplanes circled in the sky to celebrate. After the military band played the Bulgarian national anthem, a brief religious ceremony was held, and another person held the torch and headed towards the Yugoslav border.</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, July 26) At 1:05 AM this morning, the World Games torch arrived at Saribud City, on the border between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. It took a total of 23 hours to pass through the Bulgarian border. Saribud is located in the mountains. Although the time was very inconvenient, the residents of the border between the two countries still gathered there to watch the torch enter the Yugoslav border. This place has historically been a point of contention between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and armed conflicts have been frequent. However, the atmosphere of harmony today is a major positive reversal. After various ceremonies, the Bulgarian runner handed the torch to the Yugoslav runner, who then set off towards Nas. He arrived at his destination at 8:30 this morning. At 9:25 tonight, the torch will reach Kragujevac. At 1:30 AM on the 26th, it will reach Osovna. The remains of Alexander I, the "Unifier of Yugoslavia," who was assassinated in Marseille in 1934, are buried there. When the runner arrives at Ovrena, he will light the eternal flame in front of the tomb of Alexander I and observe a minute of silence. After this, King Peter II of Yugoslavia will light the torch and run one kilometer.</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, July 27) The World Games artillery arrived here at 9:20 this morning. A large group of farmers had been waiting outside the city for a long time, and they welcomed its arrival and held a celebration ceremony.</p>
<p>World Games Athletes Accompanying Expedition (3rd Letter, Continued from Yesterday) Sent by Central News Agency Correspondent Feng Youzhen (10) (9) Basketball Team Slightly Wins Over New Federation</p>
<p>Yesterday (2nd) afternoon at 4:00 PM, the basketball team played an unofficial friendly match with the Singapore Combined Team. Originally, our athletes were very tired in body and spirit after six or seven days of sailing. Several of them could barely eat, and a match was absolutely impossible. However, the overseas Chinese in Singapore were very eager to have a friendly match. They had already gathered the best players from each team, trained them, and sold tickets without even seeking our consent (50 cents each, equivalent to one yuan in national currency). Many people from various cities on the Malay Peninsula came to see this match. After the ship docked, representatives from various organizations requested a match after the public banquet. Everyone pushed the responsibility onto Coach Dong Shouyi, who had no choice but to agree. At 3:30 PM, the basketball court in the Great World was already packed. The martial arts team first performed, and the program was very exciting, winning a lot of applause from the overseas Chinese. At 3:45 PM, the athletes entered the arena to stretch their muscles and bones. They first divided into two teams to perform for six minutes. Team A was Wang Yuzeng, Mou Zuoyun, Wang Hongbin, Li Shaokang, and Wang Nanzhen. Team B was Liu Qicheng, Feng Nianhua, Xu Zhaoxiong, Liu Yunzhang, and Cai Yanxiong. As a result, Team A won 8 to 2. At 4:00 PM, the athletes and the New Federation Team lined up for battle. The athletes sent out their most elite Team A, with three forwards darting in and out of the enemy's camp as if they were in no-man's land. In less than two minutes, they scored four goals. When the athletes scored 12 points, the New Federation only scored one. The excitement of the performance left the overseas Chinese stunned. Later, the athletes took turns replacing team members, and their spirits were not as excited as at the beginning. They politely let the New Federation Team slowly catch up. After playing for 30 minutes non-stop, the athletes won slightly by a score of 28 to 25. Everyone rushed back to the ship, leaving Singapore amidst the enthusiastic farewells of the overseas Chinese. (Recorded July 3rd)</p>
<p>(2) (10) Sailing in the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>After leaving Singapore, the ship moved forward in the Strait of Malacca. It was a night in the middle of the lunar month, and a bright moon illuminated the sky. Fleeting clouds streaked like arrows, and a silver light reflected on the calm sea surface, evoking an indescribable beauty. We lay on deck in wicker chairs, intoxicated in the embrace of nature, truly feeling refreshed and almost feeling like ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sun reappeared. The shores of the Strait of Malacca were lush with trees, and the scenery was very beautiful. Everyone felt very comfortable with this kind of sea travel. At 10:00 AM, the discussion committee invited Ms. Huang Liming to give a lecture on European etiquette in the second-class smoking room. Many people went to listen.</p>
<p>In the evening, the ship had passed through the Strait of Malacca and was sailing in the Indian Ocean. This Indian Ocean, known for its wind and waves, had not yet shown its most ferocious form, but the ship's body was already swaying up and down, far less comfortable and stable than when sailing in the Strait of Malacca. Those who were afraid of seasickness hid in their cabins and lay down. At dinner, there were many empty seats in the dining room. At 9:00 PM, the entertainment committee held an entertainment party on the first-class deck. All Chinese and foreign passengers on the ship were invited to participate. A total of 300 people attended. Chairman Shen Siliang sang the party song and gave an opening speech. Then, he invited the captain to give a brief speech, and then the entertainment program began. First, Wang Huaiqi and Jiang Zhende collaborated to perform a skit of a midget giving a speech, followed by a martial arts performance. Although they could not fully demonstrate their skills due to the low cabin and the ship's shaking, each program was very exciting, winning thunderous applause. Many foreign passengers especially praised it. Qu Lianyuan and Zheng Huaixian performed a skit of sparring. As a result, Ms. Qu's elbows were bruised in several places, and Strongman Zheng also had several red marks, showing how seriously they performed. Over the past two days (4th and 5th), the wind and waves have become more and more ferocious. The rising and falling wave peaks produced milky white foam, which hit the ship's body, splashing water one or two dozen feet high. The sea breeze made a tiger-like roar, which was frightening. The ship's body swayed up and down and left and right as if in rhythm, making many people dizzy. The number of people eating decreased even further. Even those who could support themselves to walk to the dining room only did so perfunctorily. Mr. Chu Anping of the Central Daily News, who was in the same room and at the same table as me, lay in bed for two days, unable to leave the bed even one step. Mr. Luo Gusun of the International Photography Agency, who had the capacity of a giant, only shook his head and sighed at the dishes.</p>
<p>Today (5th) at 10:00 AM, the Fellowship Association held its first meeting in the second-class smoking room. Only compatriots on the ship were allowed to participate. Because the wind and waves were too strong, only seventy or eighty people attended. Chairman Shen Siliang gave a speech, followed by speeches by Jiang Yong, president of the Fellowship Association, and Pan Huaguo, deputy military attaché stationed in Germany. Then, everyone introduced themselves by name and surname to show their introduction. Deng Bingling, the China Travel Service agent accompanying the ship, also provided tea and refreshments, and everyone dispersed in joy. It is planned to hold another meeting before leaving the ship, and perhaps more people can participate at that time.</p>
<p>The Xiangqi (Elephant Chess) Championship has reached the final stage. The two gentlemen who won the right to the final are Qian Yiqin and Wu Demao. The two gentlemen are truly evenly matched, fighting fiercely for several rounds without a winner. As a result, they ended up splitting the championship. I met General Qian in the first week and was defeated. However, the tension of the situation could not be compared even to the final week. I only managed to "eat" after one win and one loss, which was somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>The ship is scheduled to arrive in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, at 1:00 PM tomorrow (6th), completing a voyage of 1,576 nautical miles. There will probably be a six or seven-hour stopover. Everyone hopes that time will pass quickly, and perhaps the extremely tired spirits and bodies can recover somewhat at that time. (Recorded July 5th, sent from Colombo July 6th) (End)</p>

In the second week of the doubles tournament, there were originally four matches scheduled yesterday, but only three were played, with the other postponed to tomorrow. In yesterday's match, Carson and Squire defeated the mixed team of Min Yue and Tao Tingyao two sets to zero, but the scores were very close, both sets being six to four. However, Tang Jiabao and Ye Baosheng suffered a crushing defeat to Forbes and Mermen. In the total of three sets, Tang and Ye only won one set, which was truly unexpected. The match between Ke Lasha and Kao Sitan against the Russians Andrew Suo and Bao, both sides were very persistent, resulting in slow progress and a result only determined at dusk. The semifinals begin today and will conclude tomorrow, with the quarterfinals to be held the day after tomorrow (the 30th). The finals are scheduled for the 31st (Friday). After many elimination rounds, only three Chinese teams advanced to the semifinals: Hu Xuguang and Li Guofan, He Tong and Zhu Longyi, and He Jialiu and Liu Jie. Foreigners accounted for five groups.

<h3 id="e189">Municipal Elementary Schools Hire Teachers - Preferably Employ Graduates of Municipal Normal Schools - If Transfer is Needed, Must First Submit to the Bureau for Approval - Education Bureau Issued an Order to All Elementary Schools to Comply <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all municipal elementary schools, stating, "Upon investigation, when municipal elementary schools in this city hire teachers, they should preferentially employ graduates from the municipal Xinlu Normal School and the normal departments of Wuben Girls' High School and Jingye High School in this city. Those who are already employed as teachers and staff should not be arbitrarily replaced by the schools if their teaching is still good. This has already been strictly ordered for compliance in previous cases. Now, according to a report from the Xinlu Normal School Alumni Association, since the members of this association graduated from their alma mater, there are sixty to seventy people who have been able to serve in this city. If it were not for your care and support, how could this be achieved? Therefore, the members of this association, in addition to being deeply grateful, sincerely wish to work wholeheartedly and diligently under your leadership, without complaint, to fulfill their duties and seek to develop education in this city and contribute to your great kindness. As for the protection of the positions of the members of this association, you first established the regulations for the service of graduates from municipal normal schools, and then issued a unified order to all schools to preferentially employ graduates from municipal normal schools, and repeatedly instructed the schools not to arbitrarily change the principals who graduated from municipal normal schools. Your concern and protection for the members of this association can be said to be utmost. However, a small number of school principals ignore your instructions regarding the protection of the positions of the members of this association, without attaching importance to preferential employment, and those who have been arbitrarily changed after being employed have experienced anxiety over the years and cannot settle into their positions, merely feeling regret for not being able to fulfill their ambitions, resentment for not being able to promote education, and嘆 for not being able to repay your kindness, daring to express the greatest sincerity, without presuming to request your support for the members of this association, strictly ordering all schools to preferentially employ graduates from the municipal normal schools in this city, and those who have already been employed must not be changed or suspended without reason. If the already employed graduates from municipal normal schools have committed major errors, the points of error must be submitted to you in detail, requesting your review and compliance. Without your order, they must not be rashly changed or suspended. In this way, the members of this association can work with peace of mind and strive to develop education in this city under the protection, following you to complete the mission that the members of this association should bear." Accordingly, all graduates from the normal school or the normal departments of the municipal Wuben Girls' High School and Jingye High School who were originally hired by the schools should be protected. If a transfer is needed, the principals of the schools should be responsible for reporting their service records in detail for a decision. As the appointment period for the first semester of the 25th academic year is approaching, if the schools need to rehire or add teachers, they should still preferentially employ graduates from the municipal normal school and the normal department, otherwise, the appointment will not be approved. In addition to instructing them to be informed, the schools are hereby ordered to comply with this order. Be sure to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Overview of the Treatment of Tonsil Diseases in Children in the Provincial Capital of Jiangsu <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>—One of the Works of the Health Education Committee of the Provincial Capital of Jiangsu—</p>
<p>The importance of school health today has become an unbreakable fact in the current health and education sectors. Because school life is a stage that everyone must go through, lasting from a few years to two or three decades, almost all of humanity's wisdom and skills are cultivated in schools. However, we only pay attention to the academic instruction of children and neglect their physical health, the development of good hygiene habits, and as a result, children are physically weak, mentally and physically incomplete, prone to illness and lingering disasters, and the efficiency of teaching is weakened and reduced invisibly. Therefore, the promotion of school health really needs urgent development. For example, physical examinations, correction of defects, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases, health education, and environmental health facilities, these are all the work of school health.</p>
<p>Correcting defects is one of the most important tasks of school health. All the physical health defects found during health examinations must be properly corrected to restore them to a normal state. Among the defect items, trachoma, tooth decay, and tonsils are the most common. The treatment of trachoma, ear diseases, and dental diseases can still be carried out in schools, but it is difficult to treat tonsils. Because the method of treating tonsils requires surgery, which takes time and requires a well-equipped hospital to perform. However, when the medical knowledge of the general parents of children is lacking, they do not know the harm of enlarged tonsils, and when they hear about the removal, they immediately refuse. Therefore, the treatment of tonsils is only seen in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping and other places, and the number of those who are treated is very few. From this, we can see that the treatment of tonsils is a major difficulty in the implementation of school health.</p>
<p>The Health Education Committee of the Provincial Capital of Jiangsu was established just two months ago. According to the results of health examinations of 2,800 students in seven primary schools in the provincial capital, about 20.71% of the students examined had enlarged tonsils. If these defects are not corrected, it will not be a way to protect the health of children in the long run. In December 24th year, the council decided to use the winter vacation period to carry out tonsil correction work. Later, with the assistance of Zhenjiang Christian Hospital, it agreed to allocate a special ward and provide various preferential measures, and the tonsil removal of this council was finally realized.</p>
<p>1.  Outline of the Scheduled Methods for Tonsil Correction</p>
<p>2.  Public Lectures: Using the time of the weekly memorial week of each school, this council will send doctors, health instructors and nurses to each school to give lectures on the harm of tonsils and their correction methods, so that students can understand and are happy to remove them.</p>
<p>3.  Issuing Brochures: This council will compile a brochure explaining enlarged tonsils and distribute them to each school. All students with enlarged tonsils will receive one each, and the principal will order the students to bring them to their parents to read, so that the parents can understand and sympathize with the implementation of the removal period and are happy to assist.</p>
<p>4.  Classroom Lectures: Using tonsils as a major unit center of teaching materials, so that students have a deep understanding of tonsils.</p>
<p>5.  Arranging Students: Each school will compile a list of the names of students with enlarged tonsils, and then the doctors of this council will re-examine them. All students with enlarged tonsils who should be corrected immediately will have their addresses identified and listed in a table, so that they can start to persuade them to have the tonsils removed.</p>
<p>6.  Parent-Teacher Conferences: Each school will convene the parents of students with tonsils, and the chief physician and nurses of this council will have individual talks with the parents to explain the harm of enlarged tonsils and simple correction methods, so that each parent can have a deep understanding of them and is willing to have their children receive tonsil correction.</p>
<p>7.  Home Visits: Nurses will be assigned to visit each student's home in person, and will earnestly persuade and explain them. After obtaining the consent of the parents, they will be asked to sign and seal, and at the same time, they will give detailed instructions to each parent on the registration, examination, hospitalization, and payment procedures for guiding students to enter the Christian Hospital at the time.</p>
<p>8.  Contact the Hospital: This council will negotiate with Zhenjiang Christian Hospital on all matters related to registration, outpatient, hospitalization, and payment preferential measures, and set detailed items for implementation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Difficulties in Handling Rural Sanitation and Solutions (2) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Fangnong</p>
<p>(7) People Live Scattered: In the countryside, large villages have only a hundred or so households, small ones only ten or so, or even single-household villages, with each village at least a li or so apart. Sometimes, although there are many villages, the population is not large. According to past experience, in a place with six thousand people, even after two or three years of promotion, farmers still do not recognize the importance of medicine and hygiene.</p>
<p>(8) Staff Do Not Understand Farmers' Psychology and Rural Conditions: Many doctors and nurses, when they first come to serve in rural areas, do not know the rural organization and the psychology of the people, and do not understand in detail what rural sanitation is. They think that the experience of the hospital is hygiene, and they do not know what method to use to promote the sanitation cause. They do not know that treatment is only the starting point for prevention, so they do not have interest and effectiveness in their work.</p>
<p>(9) There are Many Quack Doctors in Rural Areas: These doctors often persuade people to have all-inclusive treatment. The medicines they use are mostly overbearing medicines such as promoting and reducing drugs, which can temporarily alleviate the symptoms or use symptomatic treatment to muddle through. When the disease recurs or worsens, they have already received the money and are not responsible for anything, escaping without a trace. Therefore, farmers are poisoned by them, thinking that only all-inclusive doctors can wholeheartedly diagnose and treat, and use good medicine. These are all common misconceptions. A doctor should have a compassionate heart, so how could they not carefully diagnose and treat? Moreover, new doctors never have all-inclusive treatment, and all-inclusive treatment is prohibited by law. In addition, farmers are often stubborn, and we have repeatedly seen them entangled with quack doctors because of all-inclusive treatment, which is a major obstacle to the future.</p>
<p>(10) Treatment Difficulties: Handling rural sanitation starts with treatment, but because the general farmers' knowledge is simple, they can be said to know nothing about medical knowledge. Therefore, those who come for treatment will ask what the disease is, how it will be tomorrow, how it will be the day after tomorrow, and how many days it will take to recover. Even the most experienced doctor cannot answer this kind of question immediately, right? Moreover, the diagnosis of many diseases cannot be known in a day or two. If you say how it will be tomorrow and how it will be the day after tomorrow, and it does not match tomorrow, then you will be questioned again. And if you often do not give him an answer, then he will often be suspicious. If one or two doses of medicine do not have a significant effect, then he will ask another expert. Quack doctors take the opportunity to fill their pockets again and again. When the disease enters a dangerous period, it often becomes incurable, which is a common fact that we see and hear.</p>
<p>(11) General Farmers are Obsessed with the Omnipotence of Medicine, Neglecting the Most Important Natural Therapy. For example, tuberculosis, in the current era, there is no specific medicine for treatment. The medicine known now cannot cure tuberculosis. The most important thing is to be quiet, rest, get plenty of fresh air and sunlight. If you tell them this kind of health preservation method, if they can accept it, they will be disheartened because they cannot get significant results in a short period of time, or because of work, they cannot continue to implement it in time. Therefore, they cannot understand the value of natural therapy, and think that relying on quiet rest cannot cure the disease. They often lightly let go of the cure period, relying solely on the omnipotence of medicine, requesting to take medicine, in vain turning the stomach into a natural medicine store. If this kind of dream is not broken, forgetting natural therapy, and only relying on taking medicine to cure lung disease, this is a great mistake. Not only is tuberculosis the case, but in fact, there are many diseases that also need to pay attention to natural therapy. Medicine is only the last resort of self-healing.</p>
<p>(12) Others, such as "New doctors (scientific doctors) are good at surgery, and Chinese doctors are good at internal medicine." This kind of absurd language has long been deeply imprinted in the minds of farmers. This is also a mistake in the concept of farmers.</p>
<p>The above twelve points are the facts experienced by the author. The following will briefly describe some remedial measures for the reference of comrades who are engaged in rural sanitation.</p>
<p>(1) Universal Education: "Universal Education" has been the most advocated argument since the September 18th Incident. Although in recent years, there have been facilities such as public schools and literacy compulsory classes in cities, the number of illiterate people in rural areas is shockingly high. However, the education expenses of farmers' land tax have been paid. Not only is there no way to enter higher education and secondary education, but there is also no opportunity to enjoy elementary education. If the people's knowledge is not open, the sanitation cause is naturally not easy to promote. Even the current strict prohibition policy is also because the people's knowledge is too shallow, "stubbornly ignoring government orders" and "regarding them as mere formalities" are also common occurrences. A few days ago, the Ministry of Education issued an order to set up rural schools everywhere. After we heard about it, we were overjoyed and wished that the authorities could realize it as soon as possible. Universal education is a sign of our national rejuvenation and national strength!</p>
<p>Since the anti-Japanese salvation movement in North China, there has been so-called "national disaster education". At this time when the national education textbooks are being reorganized, I hope that our education leaders can list hygiene as a basic subject. Because hygiene education is an important education related to the survival of the nation, we can adopt simple and easy-to-understand words as much as possible to instill knowledge about the causes of diseases, the prevention of diseases, personal hygiene, public hygiene, the benefits of new medicine, first aid methods, and the unreliability of asking gods and divination to students, so that they can plant the basic knowledge of simple medicine and hygiene when they are young. When the rural sanitation cause is developed and the rural sanitation personnel come to guide, they will easily accept it. Work such as home visits, infant care movements, maternal and child examinations, surveys of birth and death rates, and environmental sanitation will no longer be rejected or insulted. Moreover, they can also help where their abilities are lacking.</p>
<p>(2) Economic Source: Operating a business, of course, the presence or absence of money is the prerequisite condition. With money, everything can be done. This is undoubtedly a certain truth. However, there are good and evil in doing things. Like rural sanitation, it is a good thing that benefits society. However, in the minds of farmers in our country today, sanitation is not necessarily needed. If we want people to believe in sanitation, we must rely on the above-mentioned education and publicity, so that they can turn their painstaking efforts in believing in gods and divination to believing in our practically beneficial sanitation. Since they have the determination to believe, of course, for the sake of their own interests, they will also generate the power to generously donate and give assistance. However, relying solely on the fundraising of local people is not sustainable and is limited. It must rely on the government's regular expenses. If there is an insufficient amount, then the assistance of charitable organizations is required. Then the economic source is determined, and the person responsible for handling sanitation can rest assured to abide by their duties. At the same time, it can also increase the spirit of doing things. The equipment should be increased as appropriate, so as not to interrupt this great rural sanitation cause.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(89) Kidney Stones (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Q) How are kidney stones formed?</p>
<p>(A) Our urine originally contains many crystalline substances that are dissolved in it and excreted from the body. If there is an obstacle and precipitation occurs, it can turn into sand and gravel in a certain part of the kidney. When it forms small particles, it is called kidney sand; slightly larger ones are called kidney gravel; larger ones are called kidney stones.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the formation of kidney stones in both sides at the same time?</p>
<p>(A) Usually, it is formed in the kidney pelvis on one side. If it goes down into the ureter, it becomes a ureteral stone; if it goes down further into the bladder, it becomes a bladder stone.</p>
<p>(Q) How many chemical components can be broken down when chemically analyzing this kind of kidney stone? What are the properties?</p>
<p>(A) The chemical components of kidney stones include urate, phosphate, and oxalate. Urate stones are brown or yellow, hard, with a smooth surface and layered cross-section. Phosphate stones are grayish-white and soft, can be crushed with two fingers, and are soluble in acetic acid. Most of them become bladder stones. Oxalate stones are made of calcium oxalate, dark brown in color, very hard, with a rough surface like mulberry, and a cross-section with money patterns, and are soluble in inorganic acids. In addition, there are carbonate stones. Cystiu stones, Xantlhin stones, ndigo stones, etc. are rare.</p>
<p>(Q) Under what circumstances does the body develop kidney stones?</p>
<p>(A) Before the formation of stones, there must be a matrix present, and urine must be abnormal at the same time. The matrix is ​​nothing more than epithelial fragments, mucus or blood clots, bacterial clumps, parasite eggs, etc.; then the stone components attach to it and become larger and larger. The reason why stone components precipitate from urine is the abnormality of urine concentration and reaction.</p>
<p>(Q) Are kidney stones related to the body or age?</p>
<p>(A) It is related to the inheritance of body constitution. Most of them are men aged 30 to 60. Children also develop them.</p>
<p>(Q) Is it related to life, diet, etc.?</p>
<p>(A) People who eat too much meat, drink alcohol, and often drink beverages with too much lime are prone to this disease.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the occurrence of kidney stones related to geography?</p>
<p>(A) There are more Westerners, especially in countries such as England, Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany. This is probably because their daily diet contains more salt.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms do patients present at the beginning of kidney stones?</p>
<p>(A) If the stones do not remain in the renal pelvis or calyx, or are very small and easy to excrete, they usually do not cause any symptoms. Sometimes pyelonephritis is triggered due to bacterial infection.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms do patients present when the stones gradually grow larger?</p>
<p>(A) Medium-sized mobile kidney stones are often embedded in the outlet of the renal pelvis or the ureter, thus causing a severe colic, called renal colic. A sharp pain in the kidney area occurs after body movements or suddenly. This severe pain goes down along the ureter, affecting the bladder or the inner side of the thigh or the back. The pain is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, and there are also points of tenderness. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(92) Talking About Changes in the Fundus From Nephritis (Part 2)</p>
<p>The symptoms of nephritis are very complicated. The main ones are proteinuria in which protein is mixed in the urine, hematuria in which blood is mixed, and the most dangerous uremia. However, there is a kind of physiological proteinuria that must be distinguished from it. That is, healthy people often find physiological proteinuria after walking for a long time, physical exertion, mental excitement, cold baths, and ingesting chicken eggs. This is what we must pay attention to. Hematuria is because the urine is mixed with a large amount of hemoglobin, so the urine often has a significant blood-like color. Hematuria can be divided into two types. One is hemoglobinuria. Red blood cells are mostly broken down, and free hemoglobin exists in the urine. One is hematuria. Red blood cells can generally maintain their original shape and are mixed in the urine. The symptoms of uremia can be divided into two types: neurological and inflammatory symptoms. In neurological symptoms, headache is often the most obvious. Headaches can often spread throughout the head, sometimes limited to the frontal, parietal, or occipital region. As for inflammatory symptoms, they are skin diseases, called uremic rash. The most common is chronic eczema. Uremia can sometimes also cause stubborn diarrhea, hoarseness, acute laryngeal edema, pneumonia, uremic pleurisy, myocarditis, peritonitis, pleurisy, uremic epistaxis, and uremic purpura, etc. dangerous diseases. If uremic spasm occurs in uremia, it is mostly fatal. Therefore, once a nephritis patient falls into uremia, it can indicate that it has reached a dangerous period. In addition, nephritis patients have a strong pale color of the skin (this is because the amount of red blood cells and hemoglobin decreases after the onset of the disease.) and skin edema. Edema initially occurs on the face, with obvious swelling of the eyelids. Therefore, the eyelid fissure is also narrowed. Soon, the skin of the whole body also develops strong edema.</p>
<p>After reading the above section, we can probably get a considerable understanding of nephritis. However, changes in the fundus are also important and should not be ignored. Because changes in the fundus can often be used as an aid to diagnosis. Therefore, doctors should first examine the urine when they suspect nephritis. At the same time, they should also examine the fundus, nothing more than to seek accurate diagnosis. However, this is not only the case with nephritis. Changes in the fundus are also often caused in diabetes, syphilis, tuberculosis, trauma, and arteriosclerosis. Therefore, it should also be checked in these situations. Changes in the fundus mostly belong to retinal diseases. Now, let me briefly describe retinitis caused by nephritis.</p>
<p>Nephritic retinitis, also known as albuminuric retinitis. Ten percent of nephritis patients can develop this disease. It is especially common when chronic nephritis transitions to renal atrophy, or during the progression of renal atrophy. It is also often found in gestational nephritis. Its symptoms are bleeding, white spots, and venous congestion and tortuosity in the retina of both eyes. The optic disc is also red, turbid, and swollen. Stellate white spots or large and small yellow spots occur in the periphery of the macular area and the vicinity of the optic disc. The patient feels that his vision is impaired. The prognosis of this disease is generally poor. Its treatment should focus on treating nephritis. Zhou Mengbai</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 304) Why do you sometimes need to use two kinds of materials to fill a deep cavity when the dental pulp is not dead?</p>
<p>Answer: Deep cavities are close to the dental pulp, so a layer of cement that is impervious to cold and heat should be laid first as a base, and then filled with metal.</p>
<p>(Question 305) What material is used to fill the root canal?</p>
<p>Answer: Fine strips made of rubber (commonly called artificial nerves) and a paste made of disinfectant are filled into the root canal. After the root canal is filled, a layer of cement is laid on it, and the remaining part can be completely filled with ordinary filling material.</p>
<p>Section 8 Extraction Problems</p>
<p>(Question 206) Which teeth should be extracted?</p>
<p>Answer: The following types should be extracted: (1) Cavities that cannot be filled and cannot be fitted with inlays; (2) Diseased teeth that cause severe pain and cannot be cured; (3) Teeth that have been loosened and cannot be firmly planted, or teeth that have been broken; (4) Diseased teeth that have become suppurated and are ineffective and endanger health; (5) Tooth roots that hinder the fitting of full dentures; (6) Useless and obstructive teeth, such as supernumerary ectopic teeth, etc.</p>
<p>(Question 207) What things should you tell the dentist before extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: Anyone with heart disease, people who are prone to bleeding, people who have nervous disorders or are prone to epilepsy, or people who have neurasthenia and have been insomnia for several days should tell the doctor about his suffering. If it is not suitable for extraction, you can stop or wait until the future to extract. Also, pregnant women who are four or five months pregnant should also tell the doctor. All these are for the sake of caution, so as to avoid the doctor from acting rashly without paying attention.</p>
<p>(Question 208) What time of day is the most suitable for extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: Morning is the most appropriate, and evening is not very appropriate.</p>
<p>(Question 209) Is tooth extraction painful?</p>
<p>Answer: In the past, tooth extraction was indeed a painful and terrible thing. But since the invention of very safe and effective anesthetics, unless there are special circumstances, it can be said that there is no pain at all, just like cutting hair and trimming nails, it is not a big deal.</p>
<p>(Question 210) Why should the patient be absolutely calm during the extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: Since tooth extraction is not painful and is performed in a formal dentist's office, and there is no danger, it is a very common thing and there is no reason to be afraid. If you are afraid, many difficulties will arise. Some occasional complications during tooth extraction are caused by the patient's panic, so the patient should be absolutely calm and have the kind of attitude described in the story of Guan Yu scraping bone to cure the disease and playing chess calmly. In ancient times, there was no anesthetic. If you are still afraid of tooth extraction safely and painlessly today, it is really a self-inflicted trouble and too unmanly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange only traded August futures for one month. July futures have already been discontinued and will be settled on the 29th. September futures trading began today, and market conditions are increasingly favorable. The Guangdong unrest is no longer significant, and the government's arrangements are appropriate, and it will be resolved in a short period. The government bond market is becoming more consolidated, and sellers are becoming increasingly anxious. Although only one month of trading is done, buying and selling are still very lively, and high prices continue to advance. August market prices are all new prices. Based on the environment and market sentiment, continued increases can be predicted. Yesterday's trading, from the opening to the close, increased in each session, and the trend became stronger. Class A bonds have broken through 68 yuan, soaring upwards. Sellers are covering their positions more aggressively, and sellers are becoming scarcer. Bulls are not shaken by the high market price. The result of the two sessions was an increase of 89 cents to 1 yuan and 25 cents. The total transaction volume was 4.25 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>After the sharp decline in the yarn market on the previous day, yesterday it was slightly more stable, but most people's psychology is that because the warehouse stockpile of yarn has exceeded 36,000 bales, the industry is still inclined to sell. However, although some bulls have emerged, they have not given up on large-scale absorption.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Marked Yarn Rises Again <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The market for marked yarn opened with the overseas cotton industry in good shape, so the bulls did not move, and market sentiment was slightly higher. However, the near term was relatively flat. The far term was extremely firm. Dachangcheng, Zhenda, Mingde, Taichang, etc. purchased, rising by 1.3, 4, 2 jiao. After the second session, due to the increase in yarn inventories in other warehouses, the momentum turned downward. One said that the bulls might let go, so there were few buyers, and it gradually decreased. However, the securities groups occasionally entered and exited, and the spot yarn business gradually improved. As a result, each month's closing price rose by 3, 4, 5, 9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The auction was stopped in the afternoon due to the hot weather. It was found that Jinchang sold 1,450 bales, Gengji 550 bales, Renfeng 500 bales, Chang 1,050 bales, Changfeng 3,000 bales, Runkang 1,800 bales, and Tonghe 1,500 bales.

<p>New cotton is slightly firmer, because the American and Indian cotton markets are rising, and people's minds are tense. However, the July futures for old cotton were suspended from trading in the afternoon of the previous day. According to the market, this trend has not completely stopped. Bulls and bears have different thoughts on the August futures for old cotton, but the momentum is weak, so it fell alone by 7 jiao.</p>

<p>In the first seven sessions of the market for marked cotton, American cotton rose by 10 to 14 points, Indian cotton fell by 4 rupees, and Osaka cotton rose by 8.9 jiao to 1 yuan. The market was slightly shocked. The August old cotton opened in the first session. Although there was no problem for the bulls to receive the goods, according to market rumors, it has not been completely resolved, people's minds are uncertain, and it fell. The far-term new cotton was constrained by foreign cotton and trended higher, rising by 4.5 jiao. After the second session, it still regarded August cotton as weak, and the far-term cotton was affected by it. Moreover, it was said that the weather has been good recently, and the new cotton has grown vigorously. There were quite a few sellers. As a result, August cotton fell by 7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far-term cotton rose by 2 jiao to 2.5 jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 1,200 dan, Tongji 1,800 dan, Mingde 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,800 dan, Fengtai 2,600 dan, Yicheng 1,300 dan, Changfeng 7,200 dan, Tonghe 1,500 dan, Changhe 5,000 dan.

<p>Recently, the yarn and cloth exchange market, because of the frequent accidents in the July and August old cotton futures, has been turbulent, with drastic ups and downs, as recorded in this newspaper. At the time of the routine settlement at the end of this month, there were huge storms on the two days before and after, and the competition between the bulls and bears was extremely fierce, which was rare in history. On the day before the delivery date (24th), the general speculators found great panic, and the market price rose in a straight line, like a tide, unstoppable, rising above the exchange's limit price, so both sides announced a suspension of trading, the highest point being 52.5 yuan, the sharpness of the rise was terrifying. It is said that although there are 100,000 dan of cotton that have passed the inspection at the inspection office, it is still short of the top cover, so there is a crazy rise. Unexpectedly (25th) was the last scene of the bulls and bears struggling. The first two sessions opened with a sudden sharp drop, with July falling by 3.5 yuan and August falling by 3 yuan, both exceeding the exchange's statutory suspension limit, and trading was also suspended. When trading opened in the afternoon, the bulls and bears were at odds, and the market was chaotic, with different opinions. Some said that the bulls were dissatisfied with the exchange's suspension of new trading and tried to settle as much as possible, causing the price to fall to the limit. Another said that a certain aspect had been compromised and a peaceful solution was announced. However, after a long period of chaos, the exchange was forced to the statutory limit price and was unable to open trading. As a result, the July and August futures were not traded at all. At this final stage of this month, such a huge storm was staged, causing the bulls and bears to be unable to make a full settlement, which is still a novelty. However, the general speculators were unable to receive the goods and were very eager to sell, shouting a price of 45.6 yuan, willing to get out. The exchange did not allow trading to open, and there was no result. After the market closed, the bulls and bears looked for accounts to settle at a premium, with the selling party settling at 1 yuan or 2 yuan lower than the listed price of 49 yuan. As a result, the remaining 121,200 dan, of which 20,000 were in stock, and 30,800 were in disaster relief, with a net stock of 90,400 dan. According to the market, the bulls will of course not follow the routine receiving rules because trading failed to open in the afternoon on that day. Another said that they had reached a compromise with the other party, and if the quality of the goods received was found to be substandard, etc., the exchange would be responsible for compensating for the price loss. There are conflicting rumors in the market, and no one knows the truth. The latest news is that the exchange is still holding a meeting to discuss solutions.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth: Recently, because of the general positive sentiment in all areas regarding autumn dyeing and printed goods, such as printed flannel, colored striped flannel, white flannel, blue cloth, yuan twill, printed satin, Zhigong, serge, plain serge, Zhigong, thread tweed, large quantities of August and September futures have been ordered, the price is gradually rising, and the ordering parties continue to make orders, and the momentum is not weakening. All factories have thrown out huge amounts of futures, the price of printed flannel has increased from 1 jiao 6 fen to 1 jiao 8 and a half fen, and the price of serge has increased from 2 jiao 3 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen 75, and the prices of other goods have also increased uniformly, so the factories are eager to pull in gray cloth, and the annual regulations of Japanese factories stipulate that during this hot summer, before the new cotton comes on the market, the number of working days will be reduced by two days per week for one or two months, and the output will of course be greatly reduced. At the same time, the output of Chinese factories is also not enough to meet market demand. In previous years, this was the busy farming season, and the summer goods were declining, and the autumn goods were still lacking demand, and the factories were holding back goods, but this year there is this abnormal phenomenon, which is actually due to the currency problem and the abundant harvests in various places. Yesterday's market situation was still stable, the sales of white goods were flat, and only the four gentlemen serge and Zhigong of colored goods were still high in demand by Japanese merchants, and last Friday and Saturday they received scattered goods from the market, and the market rose sharply, soaring 7 and a half li per yard from the last market.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth: The Shanghai offices of Sichuan and Guizhou merchants have recently received letters and telegrams, planning to buy woolen cloth, wide and narrow camel hair, plain serge, tweed, Walter tweed, yuan woolen felt, Melton, etc., which are needed for autumn sales, and transactions continue, and the market situation is quite good. More than ten boxes of Polish goods and Melton were thrown out, priced at 1.95 yuan net, woolen felt was 6.4 yuan, yuan woolen was 2.05 yuan, Western Walter tweed was 4 yuan, Eastern goods were 3.7 yuan, domestic goods were 3.9 yuan, 559 Sima Xiangru Zhigong tweed was 4.9 yuan, and Weiyite brand wide and narrow camel hair was 1.7 yuan for the first grade, 1.5 yuan for the second grade, and 1.3 yuan for the third grade.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Grain: Bulls Have No Intention of Continuing to Support; Wheat Flour Falls Sharply <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<h3 id="e221">Flour Exchange to Stop Afternoon Trading Starting Today <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month was uniformly tired and sluggish. In the afternoon, the collapse was quite large. Initially, at 4 o'clock, there was a difference of about 1 jiao in the price of foreign wheat, and the market sentiment was that this month had already been settled according to the limit, and it was inferred from this that the market could no longer rise. Also, this year's summer harvest was reported to be abundant, and the main food was cheap, so the price of flour would naturally fall, so people's minds softened, and many bulls unloaded their goods, and the market was depressed. When trading opened in the afternoon, most of the bulls had no intention of continuing to support, and the flower and yarn market also reversed from high to fall, and people were inevitably worried, so the shouting price was greatly relaxed, and the fall was very large. After this situation, if the sales of flour are flat, it may still be soft.</p>
<p>Also, the Flour Exchange originally scheduled to close in the afternoon yesterday, but it was heard that the procedures had not yet been completed, so it was changed to close in the afternoon starting from July 28th. The morning session will start at 10 o'clock and trade in four sessions.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the market for each month was generally flat and soft. Because the new rice harvest in the Yangtze River area this year was very abundant, people's minds in the industry had long been softened. As for the outside bulls, they were worried about the repetition of the flower and yarn market, so they seemed not to encourage it anymore, so the market was able to gradually move towards the right path and the shouting price was gradually loosened. When trading opened in the afternoon, the current month was the last day, and many of the industry's goods were withdrawn by themselves, so the market was still stable. As for August and below, because the flour market was falling sharply, most of the insiders and outsiders unloading high-priced goods were still able to stand firm, so the near term fell by 78 fen, and the far term fell by 1 jiao. Observing the future, it is still expected to be weak. In the spot market, high-priced goods are still able to stand firm, especially high-priced goods are 4.55 yuan to 5.2 yuan, and the factories are handling more than 2,000 bags. The middle and lower grades are being suppressed by each factory everywhere, and the counter-offer is 1 jiao less than the previous week, so there is no transaction.</p>

<h3 id="e223">The River Down Rice Market Also Sees Weakness <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(Ke Xian) Because this year's summer is hot and abundant, people's minds are more inclined to soften, and dealers and guests continue to depreciate prices and seek sales. In yesterday's market, each rice continued to fall by a small amount, and there were still handles for sales on Ben Street, but the sales were all small. The general market opened with 2,252 bags of Jiangxi rice and 823 bags of Hunan rice. The way out is mainly in Ben Street. Xiamen, Shantou, and the north are all handling sales in the inland areas. However, there is news of foreign harvests in the Yangtze River area, and the early rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is also better than in previous years. The asking price for new Ke Xian rice is only between 6 yuan and 6.5 yuan, and the selling price of old rice is still far away, so most people in the market are still looking at the small side.</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources for each gang were still not many, only arriving at the 13th and 14th, with a total of 2,5600 shi of goods. However, there was no turnaround in the sales market. The stomach capacity was still only 500 bags of thin rice handled by the Qingdao gang, so the market situation went downstream, the price of thick early japonica rice fell by 1 jiao, the price of thin rice depreciated by a few points to a jiao, Du Yangjian followed and lowered by nearly a chi, and Yin Yuan lacked goods, without honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Recently, the rice market has been going downstream day by day. Although the prices in each producing area have been falling day by day, it is still difficult to meet the needs of the Shen market, resulting in few sources for each gang down the river. Yesterday morning, there were only ten items. All kinds of rice in the market were sluggish and slightly moving, and the price was flat and weak. The price of white yuan was 67 fen lower, and the price of thin rice and fresh top goods showed a soft trend. The middle and lower grades were 1 jiao lower, Yangbu Xian high-priced goods were 67 fen lower, the middle and lower grades fell by 12 jiao, and the retail sales of Ke Jian were sluggish and detailed, and the price was reduced by 2 jiao. The remaining goods were all reduced in price, and there was a lack of arrival of special japonica rice.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Oil Mills Purchase Many New Yellow Soybeans <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's new yellow soybean market was more tense compared to Saturday, due to the excitement of the oil mills to purchase, and other sales markets such as Ben Street Ningbo Oil Head also continued unabated, so although there are 34,000 bags of sources every day, the general forecast for the market is quite stable. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of Chengmen soybeans, more than 1,000 bags of Sanyang soybeans, more than 170 bags of Poyang soybeans, more than 109 bags of Poyang Green Soybeans, more than 170 bags of Poyang Black Soybeans, more than 220 bags of Jiangqiao Soybeans, 51 bags of large-grain Zhuxi Soybeans, 59 bags of Liufangchi Soybeans, and 30 bags of new Hunan Maocha Soybeans continued to arrive, and the price was 5.4 yuan per original tray, which was handled by the Xiamen gang.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, such as domestic red sand, continued to rise, while foreign sugar showed weakness. The Association's cutting price for 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 21.85 yuan, down 5 fen from last Saturday, and the price for two light transfer goods was 6.7 yuan. The spot price for East White Sugar No. 4 T mark was 21.67 yuan, down 3 fen, the price for No. 8 was 21.35 yuan, and the price for No. 9 was 21.15 yuan. The price for re-exported goods No. 8 ET mark was 6.5 yuan, down 5 fen, and there were no other changes. The original price was quoted for Mian Bai Zhen Ji, Jin Xin, and Dahua from this factory. The Hao Pan had a Jian Bang opening of more than 200 bags of Zhao'an Red, 14.7 yuan, up about 1 yuan from the previous week, and the Guang Bang opened 256 bags of Hainan Red, 12.6 yuan, up another 1 jiao. The joint company was the first bid exchange period of this week yesterday, with a total quota of 8,241 bags for Guangdong coarse white sugar, etc. The bid price was the same as before, but because the price of Dutch coarse white sugar was loosening and gradually approaching, the dealers were waiting and watching, and only 10 bags of No. 4 Mian Bai were sold, 20.6 yuan, and there were no other transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Abundant Production... The Market is Expected to Loosen <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>New Red Lotus Seeds: Hankou News, the first batch of lotus seeds from this lake has arrived, opening at 38.4 yuan. It is heard that this year's harvest is very abundant, and there is a possibility of loosening in the later market. The goods from Changde, Jiuxi, Hengzhou, etc. will also be available in late this month.</p>
<p>New White Lotus Seeds: Qin Sisters Creek News, a few new goods of the first and second batches of white lotus seeds have arrived, opening at 489 yuan. This year is also a bumper harvest. It is heard that the quoted price for delivery during the Mid-Autumn Festival differs by more than ten yuan, which shows that the situation of loosening is already evident. Only two bags have arrived in the Shanghai market, and are roughly sold for around 55 yuan.</p>
<p>New Black Dates: Tianjin News, the first batch of thousands of pieces of new black dates has arrived, opening at 112 yuan, and more than 200 pieces of An Gao Zhuang have opened at 10 yuan to 9.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e229">The Ocean-Going Fishermen Have Stopped Fishing and the Fishing Boats Have Disbanded. According to Reports from Ningbo Mountains, the Harvest of this Year's New Goods is Indeed More Abundant than Last Year, but Most of the Products are Small and Thin, and Large Pieces of Good Goods Only Account for a Small Number. Each Batch Arriving is Mostly Lower Grade, Resulting in Customers Abandoning the New Goods and Opting for the Old Ones. Therefore, the Market for Existing Old Goods is Very Popular, and Dealers' Quoted Prices are Gradually Increasing. Currently, High-Grade Old Goods in the Market Have Risen to 40 Yuan, General Goods are 38 Yuan, and Extra-Large Goods are 44 Yuan. Merchants from Hunan and Jiangxi are Purchasing Vigorously, and the Stocks at the Bottom of the Street are Almost Exhausted. The New Goods That are Large and Outstanding are All Stocked by the Mountain Guests, and the Goods Sold in this City are All Middle and Lower Grade, and the Dealers' Trays are Sold for 31 Yuan, and the Customer Sales are Sluggish. The Arrival and Stock of New Yantai Dried Fish are Lacking, the Price for Selecting Large Ones is 50 Yuan, General Goods are 48 Yuan, and Jiangbei Goods are 445 Yuan. <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>

<p>Market Prices are Therefore Seen to be Firm and Rising Daily</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no New York distributors, and Yokohama's current futures sales opened higher by 35 yuan compared to last Saturday. Shanghai's white factory exports are still difficult to approach. Yesterday, only Gray &amp; Co. in the foreign silk market had slight transactions, and the prices were stable as last week. Hand-reeled silk, however, was still selling well, and the prices also rose accordingly. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Reiss &amp; Co. continued to sell, and new prices were frequently seen. Currently, the hand-reeled silk market in Shanghai is due to the exhaustion of inventory, the arrival of new goods, and the foreign route since mid-July is getting better every day, causing the silk merchants to hold prices firmer every day. Yesterday, hand-reeled silk sent telegrams abroad to ask for prices, such as the price of silk factories and chemicals has risen to 116 yuan to 120 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Low-Grade Black Tea Sales are Moving <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Since the large-scale listing of new goods such as Qimen and Fuliang low-grade black tea from Wenzhou, sales have been sluggish in the past two months. Yesterday, the British Company Jardine Matheson has already begun to operate, and the city has transacted more than 700 boxes, opening at 26 yuan, a decrease of 12 yuan compared to the previous listing. There are also sporadic sales of the third batch of Qimen black tea, but the selling prices are all trending downwards. The green tea market also sees uneven sales. The sales of Zhenmei green tea have suddenly become sluggish, and the transactions in yesterday's market were even rarer than before, and the prices have also fallen by 34 yuan compared to last week. Due to the large number of orders from Morocco, the transactions of Zhenmei green tea are exceptionally prosperous, and the inventory in the city is still flat, so it is difficult to expect high sales.</p>
<p>According to the report from the Tea Industry Association, the trading of Zhenmei from various routes is very quiet. The reason is that the goods handled by various firms in the past few months have been shipped to Morocco month by month, resulting in a thick inventory for a while. At this slow time, the telegram from Morocco does not match the Shanghai market, and the market is therefore relaxed. The high-priced Ping Shui Big Gang still has transactions, and there is absolutely no demand for ordinary goods, and the road ahead is not optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Metals: Overseas Metal Quotes Reported Higher <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Recently, foreign metal quotes have been reported higher and higher, because the goods are not enough for the sales market. Yesterday, the telegrams such as tinplate, company iron, black iron sheet, white lead sheet, galvanized iron sheet, new lead wire, new foreign yuan, angle iron, green lead iron, narrow strip iron, paper-wrapped iron, tie wire head, etc., are all on the rise. It is found that the strongest rise is pushed by black iron sheet, galvanized iron sheet, white lead sheet, etc. The market for 3-foot 6-foot black iron sheet has increased from 7 pounds and 10 shillings to 9 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. White lead sheet has also increased from 17 pounds and 6 shillings to 18 pounds and 9 shillings. Galvanized iron sheet has increased from 12 and a half pounds, and each color has increased by 23 pounds. For example, No. 26 is quoted at 14 and a half pounds, and No. 28 is quoted at 15 pounds and 15 shillings. According to the rumors of the foreign firms, it is said that various factories have news of negotiating the exclusive sale of the market, so the prices of new metals have been soaring recently. However, since the overseas pricing has risen, the peers in this port have also intended to hoard and hold up prices.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Statistics: Shanghai Living Expense Index <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>How Legal Tender and Smuggling Affect It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau recently conducted a detailed study on the impact of the implementation of legal tender last November and the rampant smuggling that began this April on the city's living expense index. This is indeed a question worthy of attention. The Bureau has conducted a detailed study, and the main points are listed below:</p>
<p>Rent Category: In the past eight months, among all categories of indices, only the rent category has shown a downward trend. The rent index for 1936 was 116.78, which is 3.13% lower than the previous year. In the past three or four years, due to the economic downturn in the city, more and more houses have been left vacant. Initially, this did not affect workers' housing. However, since last year, due to factory closures and layoffs, workers' incomes have plummeted after unemployment or reduced working hours. As a result, they have taken their families back to their hometowns, or squeezed into their already cramped housing to reduce rent expenses. Therefore, rental advertisements were posted all over the workers' residential areas, both in the front and back buildings. Landlords reduced rents to rent out the houses as soon as possible to reduce the burden of vacant rooms. Some even considered it a daunting task due to the lack of profit. Entire buildings were also closed down. As a result, large landlords also followed suit and reduced rents. However, even with the rent reduction, workers still found it unbearable. Therefore, the current reduction in rent not only does not help improve workers' housing problems but also further reflects the economic recession in workers' lives.</p>
<p>Food Category: The implementation of legal tender did not have much impact on rice prices. The food category index for November 1935 was 90.63, which is only 2.42% higher than the previous month. In December, the index continued to decline due to the downward trend in rice prices. Although rice prices fell further in January of this year, other items such as flour, vegetables, and soybean oil all became more expensive. The index for this category rose to 95.93. In March, it continued to increase to 99.89. In April, the price of Xian rice suddenly increased, but vegetable prices generally fell, and the index fell to 94.51. However, in May and June, rice prices continued to fall, and the index fell further to 93.48 and 93.69.</p>
<p>Clothing Category: The clothing category index for November last year was 86.14, which is 4.31% higher than the previous month. This is because the prices of various items rose with the implementation of legal tender. The index continued to rise in December and January. The index for January was 90.88. In February, it rose further to 93.01. In March and April, the prices of fine cloth, striped cloth, and woolen cloth fell, and the index hovered around 91.50. From May onwards, due to the impact of smuggling, the prices of goods plummeted, and the index fell to around 87.</p>
<p>Fuel Category: The index for this category in October 1935 was 125.10. In November, it rose sharply to 142.93, which is 14.25% higher than the previous month. This was due to the sudden increase in kerosene prices. The index continued to rise to 150.25 in January of this year. In February, March, and April, it slightly returned to 146. From May onwards, affected by kerosene smuggling, it fell to 142.54. In June, it fell further to 138.62.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category: In October last year, the index for this category was 116.96. In November, it suddenly rose to 128.20, which is 9.6% higher than the previous month. Before the currency reform, the exchange rate of copper coins fluctuated constantly. Most miscellaneous items were purchased with copper coins, so the index's ups and downs were often affected by changes in the exchange rate of copper coins. In October last year, one yuan could be exchanged for 337 coins. On November 4, it suddenly shrank to 299 coins. Soon after, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that each yuan should be worth 300 copper coins and should not fluctuate. As a result, the exchange rate stabilized, and the index for this category also remained around 125.00 with very little change.</p>
<p>General Living Expenses (Total): In October 1935, it was approximately 97.54. In November, due to currency changes, the index rose to 101.49, which is 4.05% higher. In other words, the purchasing power of silver dollars in October was 102.52, while in November, it was only 98.3. In November, it slightly rebounded, and from January of this year, it gradually increased. In March, the index reached 107.10, which is 9.80% higher than in October last year. From April onwards, due to the impact of smuggling, commodity prices fell, and the index gradually declined. By June, it was only 102.74, but it was still higher than before the implementation of legal tender. (The rest is omitted)</p>

<p>— (Lu Changfan)</p>
<p>Modern people take life too lightly. Just look at the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's statistics on suicides: on average, one person commits suicide every four hours." No! Some people take life too seriously. Just listen to the phrase "A beggar's life." From the above two points, life can be divided into two categories: Life, as light as a feather: Life, heavier than Mount Tai.</p>
<p>"Which is cleaner, 'death' or 'life'?" If you ask the majority of the people this question, you will know if their answers are correct or not. I dare to say one thing, they always answer like this: "Of course death is cleaner!" We need to study why they answer this way. The question is easy to answer: they think that the filth they can see is filth. In fact, the filth that cannot be seen is much filthier than the filth that can be seen. It is like the great powers slaughtering our soldiers and civilians with guns and cannons and invading our land with force. In their eyes, that is slaughter and invasion. They are unaware of things like economic invasion…</p>
<h3 id="e236">Gleanings from the Women's Quarters <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Nanhai Seagull</p>
<p>When idly reading the poems and songs of the ancients, descriptions of the emotions of women in their quarters make up the largest part of the rhymes. Among them, descriptions of the indescribable places between the two sexes often make the reader feel as if they are in the scene, as if they are seeing the person, and their hearts are swaying uncontrollably. However, these are mostly written by thick-skinned male poets.</p>
<p>Women's shyness is heavier than men's. Although women's poetry and songs are rich in feminine beauty, they still dare not reveal very obscene and frivolous words. But there are also exceptions. For example, Ding Liuniang's "Ten Request Songs" in the Sui Dynasty are such lovely lyrics. Among them, one song about requesting a flower pillow says: "Under the green curtains in the orchid room, the mandarin duck brocade is spread on the lotus bed. It is appropriate to enjoy the happy feelings early, and the secret intentions must be shared. If you want to be intimate, ask Lang for a flower pillow."</p>
<p>Another example is Luo Aiai's quatrain "Giving to Lang": "Qilang's thousand gold intentions, holding Lang to sleep with delicate charm. Try making sounds in the curtain, shyly opening your eyes in front of the lamp." Such delicate and sensual words are truly written as if drunk and crazy.</p>
<p>Feng Ji of the Tang Dynasty has a poem "Divine Rooster Pillow": "The pillow painted with mandarin ducks has been resting for a long time, the new misty valley is cut to fight the divine rooster. Dreaming sweetly with Lang and forgetting the dawn, the rooster is also reluctant to crow."</p>
<p>Literary works are a reflection of personality. Women's chastity is mostly due to their nature. Li Jilan, a talented woman of the Tang Dynasty, wrote about roses when she was five or six years old: "Having not married for a long time, my thoughts are chaotic and horizontal." Her father was displeased when he saw it and said, "She will surely be a woman of lost conduct in the future." Later, she did become a courtesan with open social interactions between men and women. Once, she gathered with a group of worthies, and Liu Changqing had impotence. Ji Lan teased him with a set phrase: "Is the exhalation good day and night?" Liu blurted out, "The birds are happy to have a place to rest." Her sensuality was like this.</p>
<p>There was also Ms. Xue Tao, a famous courtesan of the Tang Dynasty. When she was more than ten years old, one day her father pointed to the Chinese parasol tree in the patio and sang, "A single ancient Chinese parasol tree in the courtyard, its trunk soars into the clouds." He ordered Tao to continue. Tao said: "Branches welcome birds from the north and south: leaves send off the wind from the past and the future." Her father was displeased for a long time. Later, Xue Tao entered and exited the town's tent, serving eleven towns, all of which were known for poetry. The people who came and went and sang with her included Yuan Zhen, Bai Juyi, Niu Sengru, Linghu Chu, Pei Du, Zhang Ji, Liu Yuxi and other famous scholars. In her later years, she lived in Huanhua, Sichuan, and built a poetry building. She lived to be seventy-two years old.</p>
<p>If Li Jilan and Xue Tao were born in this world, they would surely be strong generals in the women's movement, speaking out for the oppressed women.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Discussion of an Insurance Transaction <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>A friend who works at a foreign insurance company told me the following story: A certain Westerner, a wealthy man and a fire insurance policyholder, one day brought a carpet to the company's manager. After a courteous greeting, he unfurled the carpet, which was quite luxurious, but with a hole burned in the side. He claimed that due to carelessness while smoking a cigarette, ash fell and the embers caused the damage. He sought compensation of one hundred dollars, the value of the new carpet, producing the original invoice as proof. The company manager examined it, saw the charred edges of the hole, and immediately approved the compensation as requested.</p>
<p>I commented, "The speed of the compensation is a common occurrence, but the reason behind the agreement between the client and the company is that everyone regards the small hole burned by a cigarette ash, which is insignificant, as being in accordance with the fire insurance contract, and they fulfill the terms without any doubt. This is commendable!"</p>
<p>Someone asked, "If this policyholder were Chinese, would he receive the same treatment?"</p>
<p>I would reply, "It's a pity this policyholder isn't Chinese; otherwise, the company could publicize its gratitude in the newspaper! Why wouldn't they happily use this incident as a means of attracting business with such a small expense?"</p>
<p>Someone else might say, "He is wealthy. He carelessly caused the damage himself, yet he seeks compensation for the full value. Isn't this being overly meticulous and showing a lack of generosity?"</p>
<p>I would reply, "Where reason lies, even the smallest amounts matter: this is close to being in accordance with the right path. Otherwise, how can the spirit of an industry be demonstrated and reach its full potential? The matter concerns mutual assistance, and the intention is beautiful. Business owners should strive to uphold this. Unfortunately, many Chinese merchants are focused on short-term gains and fail to understand this. The decline of many industries is partly due to this!"</p>
<h3 id="e238">Props! <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Ever since the Little Mermaid became a sensation both domestically and internationally, the average Miss is now willing to spend some of her time spent at dance halls and movie theaters by the swimming pool. Freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke: these new terms are now on their lips, as familiar as their own treasures.</p>
<p>Swimming, in the eyes of country folk, is a mundane affair. On hot summer days, even young children with yellowish hair will paddle in the ponds, splashing water for fun. They don't know any strokes, they don't wear swimsuits, they don't need any "sweethearts" to support them, and they don't want to show off. They only know how to enjoy themselves, completely different from the Misses in the city. The Misses' point of pride may lie in this very difference.</p>
<p>A friend told me that at a certain swimming pool, hordes of Misses flock there. Of course, in such a setting, there is a group of heroes who follow them, fulfilling the responsibility of supporting and protecting them; and the Misses also need these heroes to embolden them. Because of this, disputes over "props" have escalated beyond control, even developing into full-scale brawls.</p>
<p>What is a prop? This is quite interesting. It turns out that when these Misses are about to swim, they already have a sense of being on the edge of an abyss; especially at the moment of jumping in, their hearts beat proportionally with the splashing of the pool water. Therefore, there are heroes who are willing to lurk in the pool, to give them a "prop" at that last moment! It is said that this "prop" brings the heroes unexpected pleasure; and for the Misses, it can slightly reduce their fear. Who props whom, of course, each has their own territory. Mistaken props can be forgiven; but if someone tries to take over another's prop, or harbors inappropriate expectations, then the heroes will become enraged and become mortal enemies.</p>
<p>Mysterious, this "prop"!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Doubts Rise and Fall with Sight and Sound, Letters Are Exchanged; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted, and Laments Are Sent with Generosity</p>
<p>Guoqi laughed: "Scholarly types are like that; they like to wage endless literary battles over a few words in an article. "Aunt Zhang nodded and smiled: "I understand that now; you must be fighting literary wars with people in the newspaper again." Even if it's such a thing, winning is winning, and losing is losing; it's not like you're losing sesame seeds or soybeans. Why be in such a hurry?" Guoqi laughed: "That's what you call a scholar's perspective. Since Mom doesn't approve of such things, I won't reply to the letter." Aunt Zhang looked at his face and saw that his smile was still natural, so she took out the glasses she had placed in her pocket and put them on her nose. She nodded and said, "When dealing with outsiders, you should always take the path of least resistance. Saving a bit of effort with outsiders means having more effort for your own matters. Don't you think so?" Guoqi stood in the hall, looking very relaxed, looking up at the sky, and then humming an English song under his breath. He glanced at his mother and saw that she had lowered her head and was doing needlework again. Only then did he walk back to his room, put the letters back in the suitcase, and then locked the suitcase. Aunt Zhang said, "It's time for class; you can go now, right?" Guoqi said, "Not in a hurry." As he said this, his face was gentle and happy. He picked up his satchel, adjusted the brim of his felt hat, and walked out the front door as if nothing had happened. But as soon as he left the house, the situation changed drastically. He slowly lowered the hand holding his books, and his head drooped, looking only at the few feet of road in front of him. If the road from his home to the school wasn't so familiar, he really wouldn't know where he was going. He walked into the school in a daze and went straight to the campus from the school gate. On the campus, two tall phoenix trees shaded a horizontal stone bench, which was partially blocked by a small rose trellis. This was a quiet and comfortable place. So he put his satchel on the stone bench and sat there, lost in thought. He sat for a long time, then took off his hat and continued to sit there in a daze. Finally, the sound of the bell rang, waking him up. He stood up, sighed, and said, "I'm being a bit silly; let it go." Then he picked up his hat and satchel and went to the classroom to teach. Because of an indescribable feeling in his heart, he didn't go to the library to read the newspaper, nor did he look for colleagues to talk to. He walked home without enthusiasm. Of course, he didn't deliberately take the road to wait for that person, as he had done in the past few days. He walked straight down the shortest road, without thinking about anything else. (53)</p>

<h3 id="e241">The Life of Gorky (Part 1) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>Maxim Gorky, the only great writer of our time, is dead. This is the greatest misfortune for the literary world and an irreparable loss! We should express our final respect for his sudden passing, by draping a black veil in the garden of literature to mourn the fall of this brilliant star.</p>
<p>Today, we unanimously mourn Maxim Gorky, who is not only the mentor of Soviet proletarian literature, but whose noble position has already firmly occupied the throne of the authority in the world's literary scene. Gorky's enthusiastic commitment to the construction and creation of his country's new society, as well as his dedication to the working class and his efforts for the victory of Bolshevism in his brilliant writings; especially his admirable spirit of perseverance and tenacity during the era of Nicholas II's violence when he participated in revolutionary work. Therefore, Gorky's death should be mourned by all the people of the Soviet Union and their party and government leaders, and Gorky's death should be recognized as the second greatest loss to the Soviet Union after the death of Lenin.</p>
<p>Here, because of Gorky's greatness, I feel that writing a few ordinary words of mourning is too small and too meager. Therefore, I have changed to writing a few sketches about his life and a cross-section of his art here, to serve as a reverent eulogy for us to present to him—however, due to my shallow understanding, there will inevitably be many errors.</p>
<p>Gorky's name encompasses the Earth like air, but "Maxim Gorky" is just a pen name. His real name is Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. He was born on March 29, 1868, in Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia. In his childhood, he was born into a working-class family, and the family was too poor to afford to send him to school.</p>
<p>In 1878, when Gorky was ten years old, in the autumn of that year, he began to earn a living with his own strength and became an apprentice in a shoemaker's shop. The following year, he switched from the shoemaker's shop to work as an apprentice in a drafting office. But what he learned there was not drafting, but the work of a servant who did washing and sweeping.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1880, Gorky, whose living conditions were too painful, escaped from the drafting office to the banks of the Volga River, where he became an apprentice to a cook on a ship. The cook, named Smury, was a thoughtful and studious retired sergeant with a kind and gentle disposition. From him, Gorky began to understand the taste of reading.</p>
<p>In 1883, Gorky's increasing interest in reading made him realize that he should seek some systematic knowledge. So he wandered alone to Kazan, secretly hoping to enter Kazan University to study. However, this ideal was immediately shattered by reality after he tried it once; because the institutions of higher learning during the Tsarist era were set up exclusively for cultivating sons and daughters of wealthy families, how could they allow barefoot poor boys to cross the threshold! He had no choice but to reorganize his labor and enlist in a local bakery as a deputy. In Kazan, although his ambition to study had been dashed, he inadvertently gained the opportunity to get close to people in the intellectual class, and also joined the organization of reading clubs; thus he learned a little about the general situation and darkness of politics at that time, and inspired his future revolutionary thoughts; and also gained many experiences of inhuman life from personal experience, so as to create his future great creation. He lived in Kazan for four or five years, working hard in the factory, while also diligently reading works such as Dostoevsky's "Poor People". Later, his passion for the revolution increased, and he joined the group of so-called "people being watched", starting his actual revolutionary activities. Thus, Gorky's actions also began to be noticed by detectives.</p>
<p>In 1889, at the age of twenty-one, Gorky had returned to his hometown—Nizhny Novgorod from his wandering journey. This year, he was subjected to conscription inspection, and was exempted from military service because his lungs were not healthy. He worked as a clerk in a lawyer's office—the lawyer's name was Lanin, who had a great influence on Gorky's future: he read many books from this lawyer; and for this reason, in October of this year, he was arrested and imprisoned for the first time for reading special kinds of books that were not in accordance with his knowledge and education and that were not needed.</p>
<p>In 1891, at the age of twenty-three, Gorky left his hometown again and drifted to Tiflis, the capital of the Caucasus, where he worked in a railway factory. He used his spare time to write down his experiences and observations, and wrote his debut work "Makar Chudra". On September 25 of the following year, he signed the pen name "Maxim Gorky" and published it in the local newspaper "Caucasus" in Tiflis. From here, Gorky's literary career began—forty years later, on the same day of the same month in 1932, the Soviet people and party and government leaders held an unprecedented grand celebration to commemorate Gorky's forty years of literary life. The Soviet government awarded the most honorable Lenin Medal to Gorky in return for his revolutionary achievements, and the celebration decided to rename Nizhny Novgorod as "Gorkygrad" to commemorate Gorky's childhood life there.</p>

<h3 id="e242">On Electric Therapy for Gonorrhea <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— (Yaozu)</p>
<p>Electric therapy today is regarded in the medical community as the standard for treating all kinds of diseases, especially gonorrhea among venereal diseases. For example, Thias electric therapy is used for acute cases, and shortwave diathermy is used for chronic cases, both achieving good results. This is because gonorrhea germs, when exposed to electric heat above 42 degrees, will be eliminated without residue even if they are deeply hidden. The acute symptoms of gonorrhea are redness and swelling of the urethra's mucous membrane, pus dripping, severe pain and itching. Urinating makes it especially bad, often causing redness and swelling of the foreskin, inflammation of the inguinal lymph nodes, blood in the urine, and white clumps and strands clearly visible in the urine. In this acute stage, Thias electric therapy is the only treatment, and it is not difficult to cure when combined with injections and internal medicine. Chronic cases are transformed from prolonged acute gonorrhea. There is yellow mucus in the urine, mixed in the urethra. The opening of the urethra is sealed with pus in the morning. Sometimes there is a feeling of itching or burning, but swelling and pain are not severe. But if proper care is not taken at this time, the symptoms can worsen at any time. Epididymitis, cystitis, prostatitis, arthritis, etc. often occur at this time. Therefore, if gonorrhea has entered the chronic stage, shortwave diathermy and various appropriate treatments must be applied. The Father and Son Hospital in Shanghai offers fair prices and the most complete electrical therapy equipment for treating gonorrhea. With decades of experience, combined with the help of electrical therapy, it is no wonder that miraculous effects can be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e243">A Record of Curing Ten Years of Ringworm <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— (Manuscript by Yao Ruinian)</p>
<p>I have suffered from ringworm for almost ten years since I was in my twenties. It first appeared on both sides of my groin, then spread to my abdomen, and later to my neck, arms, and other places. For years, it has come and gone unpredictably, causing me much pain and itching. My skin was covered with sores, making me look dirty and unbearable. I have been struggling for food and clothing for years, and I already felt mentally and physically exhausted. This skin disease made me feel even more pain. I have tried medical treatments, but they have not been able to cure it completely. This spring, I wrote to my friend Mr. Fang to ask for a treatment method. Mr. Fang has practiced medicine for many years, and with his clinical experience, he must have some insights. Soon I received a reply, instructing me to go to Tongren Pharmacy at No. 1 Dexing Lane, New West Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai, and buy "Ganlu" (Sweet Dew) medicine water to apply. He said that I would not be disappointed. So I happily followed his advice and spent one yuan to buy a bottle. After applying it, I felt very comfortable. The scab fell off and new skin grew the next day. Given the wide area I suffered from, I only used three bottles. The itching and pain that I had before have now completely disappeared, and the skin is clean, which is especially gratifying. Alas, ringworm is a minor disease, but it has been lingering for ten years. Fortunately, I obtained this "Ganlu" good medicine, which was finally able to remove the burden of the disease in one day. I am afraid that there are many patients in the world who are waiting to be treated and wandering on the wrong path. Therefore, I have described my healing process to share it with the world.</p>

<p>— (Yu Jie)</p>
<p>Patients with neurasthenia are prone to change their minds and be suspicious due to the abnormalities of their brain nerves. Therefore, doctors must gain the patient's full trust before carrying out the appropriate treatment, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort and obtain the effect quickly. For the symptoms of spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, insomnia, palpitations, memory loss, poor vision, tinnitus, and multiple dreams, I always use "Xirukang" pills sold by Tongren Pharmacy, in addition to injections, electrotherapy, and other appropriate applications, because they have been repeatedly tested and proven to be effective. Therefore, I have specially recorded this for selection. This medicine is sold at the pharmacy department of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road and Jihuatang Pharmacy on Yunnan Road on Six Horse Road. It is said that each bottle sells for two yuan.</p>

<p>— (Zhiqian)</p>
<p>Among the most annoying and widespread diseases in the women's world, none is greater than leukorrhea. At a minimum, eight or nine out of ten women suffer from it. Its color is white, yellow, green, or red mixed with blood. It stains clothes and emits a kind of repulsive odor, damaging the body and harming life. The harm is by no means shallow. The cause is generally due to unclean intercourse, which causes infection with gonorrhea germs. Chinese women all regard this genital disease as a shameful illness, and they are ashamed to talk to doctors, resulting in increasingly weakening bodies. In mild cases, they cannot conceive; in severe cases, it is difficult to protect their lives. How can the harms be overcome? The impact on the country's population is profound and significant. In my clinical practice, whenever I treat women with leukorrhea, I always instruct them to buy internal leukorrhea pills and apply external leukorrhea pessaries. As a result, many have been cured. Moreover, the children born are all very lively and lovely, and there are very few cases of purulent eye leakage and various congenital infectious diseases. The reason why my treatment results are so good is due to the internal leukorrhea pills and external leukorrhea medicine, which are a great help. (Editor's note: Internal leukorrhea pills) and external leukorrhea medicine are both produced and sold by the Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. They can cure women's gonorrhea completely. The price is two yuan per box for internal leukorrhea pills and two yuan per box for external leukorrhea medicine. When used together, treating internally and externally, it will be cured quickly. After the cure, the complexion turns red, and the skin becomes smooth. It can also regulate menstruation and promote fertility. It is truly a sacred product that women should have in their pockets.</p>

<p>— (Shi Zeng)</p>
<p>Young men often have a proliferation of freckles on their faces during the peak of development. This is a characteristic of pigment excretion obstruction. Young women suffer from it even more. Although there are many methods for removing them, none are as effective as drug induction. Many people have used "Mianli" (Face Beautiful) to treat freckles and the spots disappeared invisibly within two weeks, turning into a white and clean face. Since then, it has never recurred. The removal of freckles by "Mianli" is to transform the structure of the skin, so that the pigment has no room to stay. Therefore, the effectiveness is rapid and cannot be compared with other crudely made products. "Mianli" is sold at Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinxiao Bridge Street, Avenue Foch, Shanghai. The price is one yuan per bottle.</p>

<p>I have had freckles on my face since I was a child, and they were quite dense. My complexion was dark. Although men are not as vain as women, who doesn't regret having an ugly appearance? Last month, I was introduced by my Shanghai friend Mr. Mu, who instructed me to buy "Mianli" to treat it. So I bought a few bottles. More than a month has passed, and sure enough, all the freckles have been removed, and my face has returned to its original appearance. I am writing this to express my gratitude.

<p>— (Jiahua)</p>
<p>My uncle had been addicted to opium for more than ten years. My aunt tried to persuade him to quit but could not change him. Unexpectedly, after three or four years, my aunt, who had been so strict in persuading him, became addicted as well. The harm of opium can be said to be profound. Now, both of them are old and sick, suffering from blood deficiency, constipation, lung weakness, and stomach problems. They spend their days languishing in bed, with a dim lamp burning, living a life of inhaling and exhaling smoke, experiencing spiritual pain and financial consumption. My uncle has no heir, and I am actually the successor. Seeing this situation, I cannot help but feel anxious. Moreover, the government's prohibitions have been very strict recently, which is alarming. Therefore, I have also expressed my concerns in a tactful way. I was permitted to help them quit. However, there are many smoking cessation doctors in Shanghai, and I didn't know where to go. I wrote to this publication, which introduced me to Dr. She Zhen at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, who is known as an expert in smoking cessation. So I accompanied the two old people to receive treatment. After Dr. She used "Phosphor Life" egg yolk essence injections and internal medicine water, their addiction was completely eliminated after three weeks, and their old ailments were also relieved. The total cost for both of them was only seventy or eighty yuan, which is less than one-fifth of the five hundred yuan they had been spending for more than ten years. This is not only fortunate for the two of them, but I am also very grateful. Therefore, I have recorded the process and submitted it to this publication, so that those who are addicted to smoking and want to quit know where to go. I heard that Dr. Yu also printed a brief smoking cessation guide. If you want to request it, you can send a letter to Dr. She's clinic, and a copy will be sent to you.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Toe Eczema and "Ganlu" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>"Ganlu" treats ringworm and sores effectively, and its reputation is well-deserved. There is no need for my praise. What I want to say is that "Ganlu" also has a special effect on toe eczema. Toe eczema is caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Small blisters will form where the bacteria are present, causing unbearable pain and itching. Once scratched, the eczema becomes even more severe. The more you scratch, the more you itch, and it won't stop until the skin breaks and bleeds. In severe cases, it is difficult to walk. In terms of treatment, one should focus on foot hygiene, washing at least once a day. Pour a little "Lysol" medicine water into the boiling water. Another is to apply "Ganlu" medicine water. "Ganlu" has a strong bactericidal agent. Only one drop is needed to deeply penetrate the mucous membrane and eliminate the root cause. The disease will be cured with just one bottle. The medicine costs one yuan per bottle and is sold at Shanghai Wing On Company and major pharmacies.</p>

<p>— (Zhu Ping)</p>
<p>When we eat at irregular times and in immoderate amounts, the stomach's secretion, movement, and digestion become fatigued, and the various organs and cells of the body cannot enjoy sufficient nutrition. As a result, stomach pain, hiccuping, vomiting, nausea, belching, heartburn, stomach distension, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, withered appearance, emaciated muscles, weak nerves, palpitations, and shortness of breath are all revealed. There is no one who does not harm their health and longevity. Therefore, those who suffer from the above-mentioned stomach problems should urgently have appropriate and effective medicine to treat them. As far as I know, the "Wei Biling" (Stomach Must Work) managed by Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinxiao Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai, is a drug that is a sodium compound agent, which has been accumulated and researched in terms of biology. The principle of its treatment has been tested for many years and can treat diseases that have already occurred and prevent diseases that have not yet manifested. It absorbs quickly. It tastes good and there is no difficulty in swallowing it. It also has the functions of appetizing the stomach, strengthening the spleen, increasing appetite, promoting the stomach's secretion, movement, and digestion, tonifying the blood, strengthening the brain, calming the nerves, and benefiting intelligence. It can be called a miraculous medicine for stomach problems.</p>
<h3 id="e252">A Contribution to Gonorrhea Patients <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhou Ming)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a disease that everyone knows is difficult to treat among venereal diseases. This is because gonococci invade the human body and are deeply hidden in the spaces between mucosal epithelial cells. Moreover, the structure of the bacteria is a diplococcus with a capsule, which makes it resistant to the effects of drugs and difficult to kill. There are many clinical methods for treating gonorrhea. Recently, the discovery of the miracle drug for treating gonorrhea, "Gonado-den," can truly be called a great enemy of gonococci. It not only has a strong bactericidal effect but also has the functions of reducing inflammation, relieving pain, stopping decay, and promoting urination. I have repeatedly tried it and have always achieved complete cures. Because Gonado-den is rich in membrane-penetrating properties, it can penetrate the membrane layer, regardless of whether the bacteria are encapsulated or deeply hidden in the folds of the human mucous membrane, and directly act on the bacteria to kill them. This is something that ordinary gonorrhea medications cannot achieve. There are many people in our country who suffer from gonorrhea, so I would like to contribute a few words to prove the effect and efficacy of Gonado-den. (Gonado-den, two yuan per box. Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, sells it. This medicine is effective for all kinds of five types of strangury and spermatorrhea. Taking a few boxes in succession can completely eradicate the disease. Both men and women can take it without any contraindications. I dare to earnestly recommend it.)</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am very grateful for your instructions in the newspaper. I immediately went to Tongren Western Pharmacy in this city and bought a bottle of "Mianli." After applying it according to the instructions, the acne that covered my face gradually subsided, and there were no scars left. My elder sister learned about this and knew that "Mianli" could also treat freckles. She immediately asked me to buy it again because she also suffered from freckles on her face. However, I secretly thought that although the medicine was effective for treating acne, it might not be effective for treating freckles. Because I didn't want to go against my sister's wishes, I bought two more bottles and gave them to her. Two or three weeks later, my sister suddenly said to me, "Thank you, Mori-di, my freckles have been cured." I examined her and it was indeed true, which surprised me greatly. Therefore, I think that although "Mianli" is undoubtedly a good medicine, if it were not for your expert guidance, patients would be like lost lambs. I respectfully write this letter to express my gratitude and wish you peace.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3 id="e254">Free Examination for Male and Female Gonorrhea <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— (Nishang)</p>
<p>Because some diseases of the reproductive organs, such as prostatitis, urethritis, spermatorrhea, etc., resemble the symptoms of gonorrhea, ordinary people often find it difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, they are often apprehensive and take random medications, which only makes the disease worse. There is also a situation where gonorrhea is not cured or is newly infected, but it is not recognized as gonorrhea, which leads to delays and errors. How absurd! To identify the cause of this disease, it is best to examine the urine under a microscope. This can distinguish whether there are gonococci, which can determine whether it is gonorrhea. This avoids the problem of blindly following medication. In Shanghai, there is a place where you can get tested for gonorrhea, and it's free. That is the Fuzi Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. It is also very convenient for women suffering from leucorrhea who want to check whether it is gonorrhea, and they receive the same preferential treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Cantonese Settle Old Scores with Chen Jitang <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to a Hong Kong telegram from the previous day, Chen Jitang was ordered by the central government to remain in Guangdong until the province was handed over clearly. Another telegram stated that Chen Jitang moved into a foreign hospital on the 24th because Cantonese were pursuing old debts. Lin Yizhong suggested that if Chen was unable to obtain a passport to go abroad, he should first take refuge in Taiwan and then go elsewhere. All the gold, silver, and valuables, valued at more than 80 million yuan, were secretly stored in a certain foreign bank at the request of Chen Weizhou. More than 70 former employees of the Guangdong Headquarters and the Executive Committee came to Hong Kong from the province on the evening of the 24th to demand living expenses from Chen Jitang because their salaries had not been paid. Judging from the above two news items, Chen Jitang's departure this time did not clarify the handover procedures, and the salaries of his subordinates were not paid. This huge debt should be settled with Chen Jitang. Not only should the central government settle accounts with Chen Jitang, but the general officials and people of Guangdong Province should also settle accounts with Chen Jitang and must not let him off easily.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang stubbornly resisted the central government's orders in the Southwest for many years. However, he falsely claimed that Guangdong Province was experiencing economic difficulties and demanded subsidies from the central government. On the one hand, he closed the door and imposed heavy taxes, including opium taxes, gambling taxes, and various exorbitant taxes, layer by layer, draining the wealth of the people of Guangdong Province. Therefore, upon his resignation and departure, all his gold, silver, and property were valued at more than 80 million yuan. Where did this wealth come from? It was nothing more than the blood and sweat of the Cantonese people. Since Chen had so much property but refused to pay the salaries of his subordinates, he plundered the people's wealth for his own private gain. As for local construction projects, he often used the excuse of financial exhaustion and was unable to carry them out wholeheartedly. The four words "harming the country and the people" are truly appropriate for Chen. Now that he has left, if this debt is not settled with him, what other debts can be settled? If we don't settle with him now, when will we settle?</p>
<p>Chen Jitang dominated the Southwest and resisted the central government's orders for several years. The central government, aware of the inappropriateness of internal wars and the necessity of unification through orders, did not hesitate to compromise and seek solutions through peaceful means. However, Chen was cunning and fickle and had absolutely no sincerity. The domestic pacification efforts were difficult to achieve, and natural efforts to resist foreign aggression could not be started. As a result, the situation in the Northwest became unmanageable. Who should bear this responsibility? None other than Chen. Now that Chen has left, the people have suffered greatly from the situation that has been delayed for several years. Even if Chen had to resign and leave due to internal resistance, it would take even more effort to clean up this defeated situation. Therefore, Chen's departure this time should not only be accounted for economically but also for disrupting national unity.</p>
<p>Chen served as the King of the South for many years, causing the country to be divided. The central government was completely unable to effectively control the political, military, and economic policies. His crimes are too numerous to count. Now that he has left, he is taking more than 80 million yuan worth of gold, silver, and treasures to become a wealthy foreigner in a foreign country. This is too comfortable. To whom can the ordinary officials in Guangdong Province who are owed salaries and the suffering people turn to shed their tears? Therefore, I say that this bad debt of Chen Jitang's should not only be settled by the central government but also by the officials and people of Guangdong Province.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Swimming and Morality <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>According to reports, while our government is sending male and female swimming athletes to the World Games, the authorities in North China have "ordered the city government to seal off" swimming pools because "mixed swimming by men and women is detrimental to morality."</p>
<p>A friend of mine saw this news and agreed, saying that swimming should be banned in China. He went on to explain his reasons, saying: In our so-called swimming pools, it's more like soaking in the water than swimming. Most of the women go to take photos so that they can be published in some pictorials with words like "swimmer" or "good swimmer." Most of the men have ulterior motives, using the pretext of swimming to get close to women. Even if someone goes to swim for real and becomes famous through swimming, they will only become a few more "mermaids" for a bunch of boring guys to idolize, like they are worshiping actors, acting as their handlers and biographers. Therefore, his conclusion is that swimming has a hundred harms and no benefits and should be banned.</p>
<p>My friend is quite "old-fashioned." He usually likes to quote some scriptures to explain that the "human heart is no longer ancient, and the world is getting worse." This time, of course, it is also "ancient," but I still write down his words here. This is not because I also like to be fashionable (China is an "ancient" country, and this year is a year of worshiping the "ancient"!) and learn to be "ancient." It is because many of the things he said are indeed true phenomena. If we do not shy away from seeking medical treatment for our illnesses, then these words need to be savored.</p>
<p>However, I cannot agree with his point of view, and therefore I do not agree with his proposition.</p>
<p>It is a fact that many young ladies go to swimming pools to take photos, and many young masters go to swimming pools with certain ulterior motives. However, what percentage does this account for? Looking at the new relationships between men and women with old eyes will always lead to the conclusion that they are "detrimental to morality." Isn't walking hand-in-hand on the road also "detrimental to morality" in the eyes of those who uphold morality? Moreover, can't "morality" be harmed by anything other than swimming? (Secretly marrying three or five wives, or even fewer, isn't that what moralists who claim to uphold "morality" often do? That is truly "detrimental to morality"!) Is it fair to take a part for the whole?</p>
<p>Furthermore, can we deny the meaning of swimming based on the "ugly deeds" of a few so-called "loose women and prostitutes"? Isn't banning swimming with things that have nothing to do with swimming itself an act of giving up eating for fear of choking? This is what wise people do.</p>
<p>As for the lesson of the "mermaid," it has nothing to do with swimming itself. Anyone who understands things a little knows this. The old society always regarded women as toys. Once an outstanding toy appeared, those in power would play with it in a joking manner because it was new. A group of flattering followers would immediately cheer and shout to create momentum in order to cater to the pleasure of those in power, and they would also make some money in the middle. As for those who were being praised, they would be flattered because their will was weak and their knowledge was insufficient.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is the current situation in North China? This is something that readers know as well as they know the palms of their hands. We really "don't want to say everything." In this dangerous environment where there is no room to breathe, they are still leisurely paying attention to swimming pools and "detrimental to morality." This makes us unable to think of any other reason besides guessing that it is "everyone for themselves," or diverting public attention. Could it really be that we are calling on people to use "morality" to resist the enemy's military, cultural, economic, and other aggressions?</p>
<h3 id="e257">A Visit to the Shanghai Frog Farm <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report) In recent years, many Chinese people have devoted themselves to productive industries, especially the promotion of rural sideline occupations, such as chicken farming, beekeeping, pigeon breeding, and rabbit raising. Nowadays, there are no shortage of people who are improving animal husbandry everywhere, and livestock farms have been established almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Our country has always been known in the world as an agricultural country. It has a vast land, abundant resources, a mild climate, and rich mountains, rivers, and land. The abundance of native products is enough to lead all countries in the world. Furthermore, statistics show that more than 70% of the people in the country are farmers. Unfortunately, the Chinese people stick to old methods and do not know how to improve, and the authorities in power have not paid attention to this. Therefore, the great resources are allowed to be buried, and rural bankruptcy has become the fatal injury to our country's economic downturn. However, when we look back at European and Western countries and Japan, can we not be awakened by their tireless research and promotion of productive industries?</p>
<p>However, in these two years, there have been many emerging industries discovered, such as goat milk farms and frog farms. I believe that as long as the government can protect and encourage these emerging industries, and the people can promote and improve them, then not only will their future development be limitless, but they will also greatly help the rural economy.</p>
<p>Frog farming is still an innovation in our country, and it is surprising to many people. However, it has long been very developed in Europe, America, and Japan. Moreover, the United States and Japan have established large-scale frog farms. In addition to frog meat for food, frogs can also be made into many leather goods. For example, the United States now has the manufacture of frog skin ties, frog skin shoes, frog skin briefcases, etc., but their prices are very expensive and not affordable for ordinary people.</p>
<p>Frogs are beneficial insects in the farm. They can prey on pests and protect crops. There is a folk saying in my hometown: "One frog watches over seven rice plants," which shows the contribution of frogs to protecting crops.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Frog Farm was founded by Mr. Shen Zhaoming and has only been around for a year. He initially purchased only six pairs of original rare giant frogs from a frog farm in Seattle, USA. Now, in addition to those that have been distributed, there are still more than ten pairs of frogs and tens of millions of small frogs and tadpoles on his farm.</p>
<p>Its address is on Memorial Road at the Jiangwan Sports Association. Yesterday, after taking a public bus to Jiangwan, it took me a long time to find a small sign on a fence that read "Shanghai Frog Farm, South from Here." So, I walked along the fence and saw a yellow wall with a big frog character on it across a field. Below it was a not-so-large fenced garden.</p>
<p>As I walked to the wooden fence gate, I was about to raise my hand to knock on the door when a dog suddenly rushed out from inside. Fortunately, the wooden fence gate was closed, or there would have been a risk of being bitten! Later, a person came out from inside and shooed the dog away. At the same time, he greeted me. I explained my intentions to him, and he expressed great pleasure and led me into the garden.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shen is still working in the office in Shanghai at the moment. He will be back at six o'clock, but he is here on Saturday afternoons and Sundays," he said to me as he walked.</p>
<p>This garden occupies more than three acres of land. The outer part is the frog farm's office and Mr. Shen's private residence. The inner part has a total of five large and small frog ponds, one is a frog breeding pond, one is a new frog pond, one is a tadpole pond, and another one raises Guangdong field chickens. One is empty and prepared for replacement. Each pond is separated by a board fence, and there is a lawn on the side of the pond for frogs to rest on the shore or prey on insects. The surface of the pond is covered with reed mats to avoid the hot sun.</p>
<p>The size of the frog pond is about fourteen or five square feet and two or three feet deep. However, the new frog pond seems to be larger, and the tadpole pond is the smallest. There are electric lights installed on the side of the pond to attract moths and other insects for the frogs to prey on. Frog breeding and management are easier than any other animal, and they do not need to be fed any kind of feed. They will grow and reproduce on their own.</p>
<p>It is said that each breeding frog can lay 10,000 eggs. After they are laid, they must be separated into different ponds, otherwise, when the tadpoles hatch and can crawl, they will be eaten by the mother frog. At least eight or nine new frogs can hatch from these 10,000 eggs. New frogs must be two years old before they can reproduce, and their reproductive capacity is very strong.</p>
<p>I will now briefly introduce the life of frogs and the benefits of frog farming for general rural sideline operators to use as a reference.</p>
<p>Frogs are amphibians with vertebrae. They have short and broad bodies, protruding eyes, and large mouths. Their front legs are short and their hind legs are long. When they are stretched out and lying flat, they look very much like a human. They are good at jumping and swimming, afraid of sunlight, and always like to come out at night to move. They often live in ponds and paddy fields, searching for grasshoppers, locusts, nymphs, mosquitoes, and all kinds of insects for food. They are very beneficial to crops.</p>
<p>The mating season is from March to April every year. In early summer, they lay their eggs in the water and grass in the pond, where the male frogs guard them. The eggs are in a kind of transparent and slippery liquid and gradually hatch into larvae - tadpoles. After three months, they become frog-shaped, and after five or six months, they can completely become frogs. As for the life of a frog, it is said to be eight or nine years long, but its reproductive capacity declines after five or six years.</p>
<p>Summer is the season when frogs are active, but every winter</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>When winter arrives, the frogs hibernate in the soil, overwintering without eating or moving. There is no need to manage them at this time. They will come out again when the spring warms up. Therefore, winter is the resting period for frog farmers.</p>
<p>Frog farming is not only simpler and easier than any other animal husbandry, but it is also low-cost and high-profit. This is because frog farms do not require vast land or elaborate buildings. Two or three acres of land and a few hundred yuan of capital can start a frog farm, and one or two people are enough to manage the farm.</p>
<p>Frogs raised by oneself are fatter and more tender than ordinary ones, and each one weighs two or three pounds. Their taste is delicious and contains a large amount of nutrients. They are very rich in protein, and eating them is very beneficial to the human body. Therefore, I think that frog farming is a new and promising industry that is worth promoting, whether in cities or in the countryside, and I expect that its demand will be as widespread as fish and meat in the future.</p>
<p>After visiting the frog pond, I went to their office and sat for a while. In a glass bottle on the desk, a dead giant frog was soaked in alcohol. I looked at its shape and felt a little scared. According to the administrator, this giant frog was accidentally killed during customs inspection when it was shipped from the United States. Now, their farm has a limited number of frog breeds, and there are many people from all over the world who want to order them, such as Nanjing Jinling University and various livestock farms, agricultural schools, or private individuals. Therefore, there is a great shortage of supply. From this, we can see a glimpse of the attention that the Chinese people are paying to the frog farming industry.</p>
<p>The price of this frog breed is very high. Original rare giant frogs that are more than two years old (can reproduce in the current year) cost 24 yuan per pair, and new frogs that are less than one year old (can reproduce in two years) also cost 12 yuan per pair. There are even some that cost more than 30 or 40 yuan.</p>
<p>On the way back, I also asked them for a copy of "The Practical Frog Farming Method" compiled by Mr. Huang Zhongcheng.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Lotus <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>I have already written a piece about lotuses. I am writing some more here, and the writing style is naturally different, but writing poorly is the same.</p>
<p>The lotus has the most names. Unopened ones are called "Hanyu," opened ones are called "Furong," and also "Fuyu." The fruit room is called "Lian," the leaves are "He," and the stem is "Ou." There are naturally other names, but I am too ignorant to know them.</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianist Zhou Mou used the lotus to compare to a "gentleman." His "Ode to the Lotus" was once selected for textbooks and is still praised by some people today. In fact, long before that old gentleman, during the time of Wu Zetian, who was deeply grieved by the Neo-Confucianists for "defiling the imperial harem," there was already a saying that the flower was used to compare to her lover, Zhang Changzong, the Sixth Prince. "The Sixth Prince is as beautiful as a lotus flower, but the lotus flower is not as beautiful as the Sixth Prince." Isn't this a famous story from ancient times to the present? The Furong in the "Song of Everlasting Regret," "face like a lotus flower, eyebrows like willow leaves," is also the lotus flower, not the Hibiscus mutabilis of melancholy wind and dew, and lonely autumn rivers.

<p>Miss Ye Ying of the Shanghai Opera Company will sing it on the Huaxing Radio Station from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM today.</p>
<p>(1) Thirty million miles of coastline, which country can compare? The actual territorial waters and fishing areas are 270,000 nautical miles. Alas, our country's rights, rights, rights, are being snatched away! Enemy fishing boats are sailing east, sailing west, how can this be! The livelihood of our country's fishermen, fishermen, is being completely destroyed. The broken nets left by our grandfathers have become useless things. Before long, our descendants will be left with broken boats, just like sinking to the bottom together!</p>
<p>(2) Thirty million miles, which country has 30 million miles of coastline? The Republic of China has 30 million miles of coastline, with 270,000 miles of large fishing area and 1.5 million fishermen who work hard for a living but pay heavy taxes. They rely entirely on the sea for survival. Enemy fishing boats trespass at will. Trawlers are very clever. There are a total of 240 of them, and their hand-operated nets are more sophisticated than ours. How many nautical miles? The Republic of China has 30 million miles of coastline, and we are unconditionally giving it up.</p>
<p>(3) The life of a fisherman is full of suffering, entrusting their lives to the sea. Too ignorant, how can we endure foreign insults again? Suffering to the point that our bellies are empty, and we are about to lose our livelihoods. Livelihoods, forever poor, forever poor, wake up! Wake up! Everyone together, unite successfully, move forward, move forward! United as one! We hope that the government will raise a large amount of capital to manufacture trawlers. We hope that the government will not relax negotiations and do its best to make the big plan a success.</p>
<p>(4) Thirty million miles, which country has 3,000 miles of coastline? The Republic of China has 30 million miles of coastline, with 270,000 miles of large fishing area. Alas, our country's national power is too weak, and our territorial rights are being bullied. It is hateful that enemy countries are infringing on our fishing rights. There is no justice, no reason. Our country's fishermen are in great danger. Our country's fishermen are losing their livelihoods. Livelihoods are being cut off and we are becoming poor. There is not a single swallow flying down to the ground. The broken nets left by our grandfathers have all become useless things. Before long, all of our broken boats that can't move will be like sinking to the bottom, to the very bottom.</p>

<p>Opening "Garland of Flowers and Moon"</p>
<p>The spring river and flower moon are most prosperous. The moon reflects the flowers, and the flowers and moon accompany each other. Flowers love the bright moon, and the moon moves the shadows of the flowers. Flowers bloom awaiting the moon, and the zither ceases its sound. In the moon, drums urge on the flowers in a chaotic beat. Fallen flowers cover the ground like ten thousand golden characters. A crescent moon is like a jade hairpin. The flowery world is ever in spring. The monthly tide is never wrong. The bright moon is like a round jade axe. The plum blossoms play "Three Variations" on a bronze pipa. Jiang Lang's dreams revolve around a flower-producing brush. Zhang Ziyou wanders as an immortal on a moon raft. Face like a peach blossom, eyebrows like the moon. The moon in the water, the flower in the mirror. It is good to rely on the Old Man of the Moon to convey marriage contracts. Ask the flower servant to pick up the phoenix hairpin. Worshiping the moon and burning incense, feelings are sincere. Burying flowers and burying jade, regret is boundless. Reed flowers, autumn moon, the guest of Xunyang. A solitary moon and plum blossoms, the recluse's home. The moon palace sweeps away the excitement like a phoenix tail. The flower-covered steps are like phoenix-headed shoes in the moonlight. Trying to catch the moon in the water is futile talk. Appreciating flowers in the fog is inherently delightful. Leaning on the moon, yearning for someone, saddened by the moon pavilion. Wearing flowers in one's hair upon passing the imperial examination, strolling down the street. Chang'e lives in the lunar palace with osmanthus. The jade maiden wipes the water caltrop flower mirror. Wanting to roll up the bead curtain to cage the night moon. Deleting evil deeds to irrigate famous flowers. Fallen flowers, weeping birds, spring sorrow water. Slanting moon, dying lamp, night dreams.</p>

<p>Extravagant. Planting flowers in the moon, beware of disturbances. Flowers, leaking moon, obscured by clouds. Drinking wine in the flower bushes, playful bees dance. Blowing a blue flute in the moon cave attracts phoenixes. The moon serves as a heavy quilt, the flowers as a pillow. Flowers are the four walls, the moon is the home. Heavenly flowers overwhelm, obscuring flower shadows. The autumn moon is often round, watching the moon's radiance. Moon waning, wind sighing, spring loneliness. Dilapidated willows, the road lies crookedly. White clouds, ten thousand miles, the moon over the mountain pass. Crimson blood, a thousand years, the flower of the imperial son. Having the moon without flowers is truly less interesting. Having flowers without the moon is quiet and without clamor. From now on. Spend the years with flowers and solemn moonlit evenings.</p>

<p>Laughable are the gentleman's two eyes. He cannot see distant objects clearly. Mistaking the tree shadow by the wall for dry firewood to gather. Seeing a snake on the ground, he thinks it's a rotten straw rope. He broke the key when locking the bookcase. He burned his lips trying to blow out the lamp. Seeing a dragonfly hiding on the flower wall. He mistakes it for a good iron nail for a blunt net. Asking for directions, he comes across a clothing store. Seeing a wax statue in a Western suit, he smiles broadly. He calls him brother and bows deeply. Asks him which town or village he is heading to. Unexpectedly, the manufactured person does not understand. Stares blankly without a sound. Blaming him for looking down on people like a dog, he gets angry and furious. He knocks him down in the hall. The owner of the store gets inexplicably angry. Negotiating with him, blaming him. Even with an honest official, it cannot be clarified. Laughable, he runs into a black dog on the road. It bites him until he is covered in blood. He returns home and takes out the door bolt. Wanting to beat the enemy, he cannot. Coincidentally, there is a person mending a wok. Seeing it, he misunderstands immediately. He breaks the broken wok with a door bolt. Ending up losing money and feeling uneasy. Pitiable to have eyes that are as good as blind.</p>
