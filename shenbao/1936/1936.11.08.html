<h3>X光檢查下的福建（中）</h3>
<p>— 雅</p>
<p>某方侵略福建的卑污政策，除上文所述福建外感病象的一部份，卽以冶容百媚的假面具，極力散播烟（包括毒品）賭娼的毒化種子之外；還另有掛着猙獰的虎頭牌式的「小典」，向我貧民階級，搾取圾後的　滴血。小典卽小當誧，利息高平值白抽二十，較我國法定利息，　高二分的標準，已超出十倍之多，可是典期還非常的短促，大多數僅爲二個片。卽當物一元，滿兩月去贖，須出息至四角，逾期卽死當。息高期促，一般平民，類多有常無贖，雖明知一進小與如進虎口」，然而爲了內煎外灼種種經濟壓迫的關係，終於只好硬着頭皮望着吃人的虎口去碰！</p>
<p>惡虎般的小典，旣圾容　吞噬平民當死了的衣物，在這虎尾之後，便又跟繫着一些吮吸餘味的估衣店及舊貨灘，不用說，牠們都是同氣相求的一邱之貉。而且這些小典，佔衣店，舊貨灘的使命猶不僅止於剝削我平民，同時這是小偷們消贓滅跡的　逃所。以前籍民犯罪，警局可以先抓而後　渡，自九一八以後，却須先通知某方領館和警署，然後才得奉陪着一塊兒去抓；可是抓的去處，假若是籍民商戶，我方警憲，便只好恭候門外。這樣一來，還愁好酒不會變酸醋麼？當然囉，有時也會抓着幾個，眞如某方所說的，「爲要顧及不十分有碍於帝國的威信」，居然也把他們監送回台；然不久復得捲土重來，而以仇眼相見。</p>
<p>有法幣的，他們請你來一套吹賭嫖；僅有衣物的，他們請你進小典；連衣物也無可當的赤貧者，似乎應該高抬貴手，留給一條生路了。然而事實上，幷不如此便當，他們還要擎着救濟貧困的旗子，向你放「日仔利」，以便激起反而對他們有利的作用。所謂「日仔利」，卽按日起利之意。逾期不償，還要遞加罰金。譬如普通，偕洋　元，先扣除利息一元五角，實付八元五角，仍以　元計賬，自第二天起，按日攤還二角五分，至四十日還淸。若四日不還足一元，就十倍罰十元，加作本金，另如法牛新利。從此償數愈多，被罰機曾亦愈多，母子相因相陳，積至三五個月後，縱是家藏萬貫的大慈醬家，也無從代你結淸這筆糊塗賬。那時拖欠旣不可，逃避又不能，被偵主擅自擄去，幽禁吊打，逼不過除自殺外，便只好走上做竊盜做漢奸之路了。鄉井之害，卽敵人之利，論功行賞，品級當不在籍民浪人之下。</p>
<p>此外，還有「出租洋牌」，更是妙想天開，「人」「財」兩得的大利市。雖說福州的南臺，厦門的鼓浪嶼，情形有些和租界相仿；但實際上幷不曾向國際間訂過什麽租界的合法條約，所以福建表面上尚不失爲一塊完土。可是內容却大不然，凡某國人經營的洋行，或籍民所開的商號，憑藉着「洽外法權」的法賣，就不向地方政府納捐稅，這比在他們本國本鄉還寫意。不納也罷（姑妄言之），可是他們還向中國商家「出租洋牌」，看營業大小，月收數元數十元的「洋牌費」，惟較應納捐稅數額稍低。唯利是圖的奸商，被其誘惑，竟不惜無形中使國籍搬了家，一旦掛出所租洋牌，果然會發生一種意想不到的效力，而令那些徵收房捐，統一捐，營業稅，印花稅（行見閘徵的所得稅）的徵收員，突然望而却步，這眞呌我人哭笑不得！萬一「洋牌」弄成了「姜太公在此」的符錄，一家貼一張。那將如何得了？</p>
<p>厦門有些一籍民，除自己偷點電燈，不納電費外，還可通綫轉賣於掛洋牌的商人。電燈公司不勝賠累，乃重金聘用某國人當稽查，雖然可以敲籍民之門而入，畢竟彼此都是一路上的人，收效如何，自可心照不宣。而且，掛了洋牌，所謂「何事不可爲」，不僅可以把它拿來做抗繳捐稅，倫點電燈的虎頭盾，同時還可以偕爲烟，賭，娼，盜的淵藪，轉縣同胞的孽錢。厦人所謂「烟窟多於米店，臺閤（卽臺妓）多於民房，賭塲多於貨攤」的三多，就是因爲有這套「開一洋行而兼營數業」的連環性的作用。又如福州掛洋牌的某飯店，除冶烟，賭，娼，盜於一爐之外，還敢販賣軍火；厦門剛改稱像私店的××旅社，地下更闢有暗室，貯藏着大量的怪物，道都是公開的秘密，而且溢盪着一股濃郁的火藥氣味。</p>
<p>他如某方在福建設報館，辦學校，立醫院，建僧寺等等文化侵略，更是翻新出奇，極盡引誘麻醉之能事。尤其是籍民所開設的醫院，在沿海各縣，眞是普遍得很。爲了他們一辭翁之　不在酒」的原故，所以當地還有「欲知本地事，最好問毫醫」之　。至於所辦中文報紙言論的荒謬，記載事實的歪曲，以及華童入學所用敎科書的不倫不類，初履其地，偶然讀之，一片「皇威浩蕩，帝國尊嚴」的語氣，有時也會不知不覺地被其蠱惑，睢然僅是暫時間的被朦騙，然已可　見奢「中人之深」了。若說一般朝斯夕斯，耳濡目染的愚氓，也不會受了麻醉，認賊作父，豈非欺人之談？蔣鼎文氏上月將赴閩北的時候，在厦門發表談話，謂沿海各縣，亟應積極推行一種「特殊敎育」，內容究指何事，可不言而喻。</p>
<p>總之，福建外感的斑斑創傷，雖不勝枚舉，但看了上述許多鮮活的例證，已令人不寒而慄；而某方居心何在？亦已昭然若揭了。血氣未衰的國人，不知作何感想：一味聽其潰爛滋蔓全身呢？抑或將用白血球的時候到了！（未完）、</p>
<p>康定通訊</p>
<h3>刧後之西康概況</h3>
<p>西康僻處邊陲，交通不便，文化落後。民元迄今，政府雖力謀開發，然因國家多事，未能一一措施。近年來，中藏交涉亦未得圓滿解决，以致西康全部，爲藏軍佔據者十之三四。目前西康建省會所轄區域，僅金沙江以東十八縣，及義敦設治委員。去歲赤匪竄康，康省軍政均入於混亂狀態，人民遭匪蹂躪，幾及全境。茲值赤匪北竄，中日外交嚴重之際，西康爲國防重心，關係國運前途至大。建省委員會圾近由雅移康，刻正從事整頓分期建設，記者爲使國人明瞭西康　近之一般狀况起見，特多方蒐集精確材料，誌之如下：</p>

<h3>羅卡諾問題　英政府送出照會　對照各國牴觸處</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府於九月十八日、分別照會法·意·德·比四國政府、提議召集羅卡諾公約五國會議、以商訂新羅卡諾公約、嗣經法意德此四國政府、先後答覆英國政府、提出若干不同之意見、英國政府於收集各國復文、加以考慮後、業於本星期三日、擬具照會，分別送交法意德此四國政府、頃據政界人士宣稱、此次英國政府所送出之照會、係就英·法·意·德·比五國政政府之觀點、加以對照、指出其中互相抵觸之處、計共分四項、</p>

<p>以上相互牴觸之四項問題、必須首先予以解决、五國間方有成立協定之可能、因此英國政府照會內、特詢問法意德比四國政府、究應就何種途徑、解决此類問題、是否應就外交途徑解决、抑儘先召集五國會議加以討論、此層須請四國政府再行表示意見云、（七日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>論艾登的外交演說</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>本月五日英外相艾登在議會中的外交演說。在艾登個人的政治史上。在英帝國整個的外交史上。都可以佔着重要的一頁。他的美妙的辭令。深刻的含蓄。廣泛的暗示。與堅確的立塲。和畏首畏尾的西門不同。和誇大固執的霍爾也不同。在國際侵略陣綫積極威脅到和平陣綫的今日。這位靑年外相可說是第一次給猶豫逡巡的英國外交吐露一個明顯的表示。那是對於希特勒的諾侖堡演說的一個答復。也是對於墨沙里尼的米蘭演說的一個答復。在國際兩大陣綫鬥爭日趨尖銳化的今日。我們不能不認為這樣明顯的表示是有着劃時代的重要性的。</p>
<p>擁護國聯與集體安全制度。維持對法對比的密切友好關係。對德維持友好。但不因此而含有排他或反對他國的作用。對於意國的誤解表示。遺憾。但以為英國在地中海上的交通路綫。必須加以保障。此外。對於遠東的中日關係。希望其和平解決。這些是艾登演說中主要的內容。這些內容表示了英國在目前國際局勢中的一個顯明態度。就是他傾向於和平陣綫方面。而對於侵略陣綫。則提出了相當强硬的警吿。也許唯一「美中不足」的。是艾登對於遠東局勢的看法。英國的希望遠東和平。是對的。但他說現在中日局勢已經有了顯著的緩和。却不免是以主觀的希望。掩蔽了客觀情形的發展。然而無論如何。英國的從模稜兩可的投機態度。漸漸堅確地移向和平陣綫。總是一個事實。而這事實就是可喜的。所以我們應該根據艾登這篇演說。略論今後英國的外交動向對於世界局勢。特別是歐洲和遠東兩個危險中心的局勢的影響。</p>
<p>在這裏。我們開始總得提一提英國在歐洲和遠東國際鬥爭中的槓程作用。簡單的說。在歐洲德法或法意兩大集團的鬥爭中。英國是站在舉足重輕的地位的。在遠東日美或日蘇的對立中。情形也是這樣。這種舉足重輕的槓桿作用。在過去某一階段。對於英國的爭取和維持世界霸權。是有利的。這有利的地位也曾經在保守黨的執政者中撒佈下投機的種子。而造成對於國際發展上不良的惡果。如日本對於亞洲大陸的侵略。希特勒統治下德國軍事野心的挺進。和英國的投機縱容。都脫不了關係。然而世界上幾個侵略勢力的勃長。終於連投機取巧者的大身利益。也受到打擊了。尤其重要的是這些侵略者要急速地把全世界捲入戰爭。以實現其重分世界的夢想。而英國所需要的到底還是維持現狀。保守和平。這樣。在世界的新戰禍日益迫近。國際兩大陣綫非常顯明的今日。英國再也不能玩弄他投機的老套。而必須在侵略與和平兩大陣綫中。選擇一個確定的地位了。</p>
<p>意國的侵併阿比西尼亞。德國巨大軍備的完成。法西斯勢力對於西班牙的干涉。這些是歐洲局勢迅速發展中使英國不得不立刻下一决斷的主要動力。現在英國已經明白表示對於法國的友誼。而認為地中海上的對意矛盾。是無可妥協的了。對於德國。儘管諾侖堡大會中高唱反蘇聯的調子。儘管里本脫洛浦到倫敦後從皮包中第一個取出來的文件。就是共同反蘇聯。而現在艾登所給與冷淡的答復。却是不反對他國。顯然的。英國對於蘇聯的和平政策。現在已有了更深的信託。自從英蘇海軍協定訂立以來。這種信託一直在增加着。就是最頑固的保守黨人物邱吉爾。現在也不得不說一個和平的蘇聯。是保持東亞和平均衡的不可少的因素了。</p>
<p>不過。對於歐洲與遠東。英國目前的看法。當然有一點不同。他最關切的應當是近在咫尺的歐洲。由於這樣。艾登外相對於遠東現狀的估量。不免以主觀的要求苟安的希望。掩蔽了實際的嚴重局勢的發展。然而遲早之間。英國對於太平洋上局勢的發展。將不能保持這樣的看法。他尤其要明瞭。單靠他這樣主觀的希望。來促成遠東的妥協。是不可能的。唯一可能的辦法。是太平洋上幾個重要和平勢力的結合。共同抵制侵略者。在這個結合中。美蘇英以及中國都可參與。任何沒有侵略野心的國家。都可以參加。</p>
<p>我們不能說英國沒有這種覺悟。最近英美法三國貨幣協定的訂立。英美在一般外交上的接近。英蘇海軍協定中英國承認蘇聯在太平洋上海軍的需要。都可以看做這種趨向的表示。自然。我們也當以更大的努力。促成太平洋上這種集體和平結合的實現。</p>

<h3>毒化下之熱河　偽官廳陷溺民衆道德　對無知愚民專市小惠　對知識分子搜捕虐待</h3>
<p>北平通信、近有籍隸熱河之李君、其父某翁、曾任國會初屆衆議員、自國都南移、乃退隱園林、當熱河陷落時、以在原籍未得逃出、乃得目睹熱河自淪陷後一切措施、茲由李君述及其情形、至爲詳盡、愛略紀如下、以見熱河狀况之一斑、</p>
<p>某方治理熱河、對於鴉片之種植、竭力提倡推廣、並强迫農民非種不可、收穫之後、某方乃儘量徵收並收買、用載重汽車押運至津·平·等地、專爲製造嗎啡毒品之用、蓋其强迫民衆推廣種植鴉片、其目的所在、不盡爲多收烟欵、以濟軍需、而實爲製造毒品、引人吸食、直接以滅弱我種族、此乃其毒化麻醉政策之毒辣、殊足畏也、</p>
<p>某方在熱河、又廣設娛樂塲、由浪入僱用漢奸、租房設塲、內有娼妓·（某國妓女居多、亦間雜有朝鮮妓女、或中國妓女）、賭博·（如麻將·牌九·紙牌。押保·等色賭具、應有盡有）、毒品·（如鴉片·嗎啡·海洛因·）酒品、（各種酒均備）此外尚有樂戲、（如二簧·梆子戲·梨花大鼓·蘇灘·淮調·等小曲戲）要之、凡所以誘導人民、使之麻醉者、無一不具、而其索價又極低廉、祗須入門之際、出洋二角、購入塲券足矣、入塲之後、首先搖彩、如中首彩、有得物約值數十元者、搖而不中、仍可持原券購物、或吸烟·飲酒·賭博·聽戲·觀妓、故靑年子弟、無知愚民、輕薄婦女、罔不墮其誘惑術中、浪人及漢奸、開設此種娛樂塲所、旣可牟重利、又可引誘中國人墮落、其計亦至毒辣、此其貽害國民經濟、陷溺國民道德、較之强追人民種植雅片、或且過之、</p>
<p>偽當局又爲市恩小民計、特裁撤各機關、各縣除縣政府·公安局·監獄·看守所外、其餘若敎育·建設·等各機關、均行裁减、故各縣田賦附加地方欵、大爲减少、民衆負担、表面驟然减輕、一般無知愚民、又爲其所惑、頗有謳歌其政續者、孰知其實際乃施行愚民政策、故將敎育·建設·等要政、或停辦或縮减、一槪採取消極主義·使國民知識·技能·程度、逐漸降低、以便易於統馭、故其表面藉詞裁减苛雜、以蘇民困、而實際乃係施行愚民政策而已、</p>
<p>僞當局對於辦理警政與稽查戶口、極爲完密、尤其對於知瞰階級、如敎員·學生·或舊爲公務員者、則調查其家庭狀况、親朋關係、詳晰周密、蓋其用意、在於防範此輩知識份子、若認爲有形迹可疑時、則竟帶押於警署、非刑拷審、往往死於笞杖之下、幸而得以不死、亦多因受刑不過、變爲殘疾或痴愚、故其對於愚民不識字者、較爲寬大、而於知識份子、至爲殘酷苛暴、</p>
<p>又其防範民變辦法、則爲收繳槍械、日軍初到熱河時、卽行下令、凡人民藏有槍械子彈者、限期登記、登記未久、旋又下令、一律繳諸偽官廳、不准私藏於民間、由價官廳發價、初則每槍一枝、僞官廳發三十元、後又提高發五十元、今則每枝發價一百二十元、查該地民間槍枝、向來售價、平常不過五六十元、今竟由僞官廳收買、高出百除元之鉅、故民間槍枝、幾盡搜、無有存留者、其防範人民之法、亦可謂無微不至矣、</p>

<h3>鐵道部長　張公權氏演講記　員工應如何努力　以盡國防之責任</h3>
<p>上海社云、鐵道部長張公權氏、前此由京抵滬、應鐵道員工軍訓班演請、上海社記者探誌其演詞如下、諸位、我鐵道員工同仁、今日來此受訓、想諸位初來之時、各人心目中、必有一感想、卽我人爲鐵道服務、何必來此受訓、軍事乃軍人之事、與鐵道員工何干、因此願乘今日補行開學典禮之機會、鄭重進言於諸位曰、</p>
<p>鐵道事業</p>
<p>在平時爲交通之命脈、在戰時爲行軍之利器、故余嘗謂、鐵道事業、爲和平之事業、亦爲戰爭之事業、以是今日諸位在此受訓、直接固爲接受軍訓、間接卽爲本身之事業而受訓、爲盡本身之職份而從事其間、當無特殊異樣之感覺而言、抑有進者、吾人服務鐵道、必須深切瞭解鐵道對國家之責任、</p>
<p>責任凡三</p>
<p>（一）便利旅客、我人務使全國國民、知鐵道交通之利便、一掃從前「視旅行爲畏途」之觀念、而人人樂意於旅行、須知國民之愛國觀念、與旅行之關係甚巨、蓋旅行可鑑賞河山之錦繡、認識國家之偉大、藉山林之秀氣、啟　睿思、因耳目之濡染、增進同情、各人之思想、得以溝通、胞與之感懷、因焉凝厚、於是可兼善互助、而推誠合作、互助　團結之先、合作是救國之本、故吾人之力謀旅客便利、可云爲增進國人合作、親愛團結、啟發人民愛國救國觀念之工作、固不僅僅爲盡鐵道員工本身之職份已也、（二）暢通貨運、「貨暢其流」爲總理之遺敎、亦民生之要義、惟如何使內地貨物、以最迅速、最經濟之方法、運輸各地、實爲吾鐵道員工不可閃避之責任、蓋貨暢其流以後、不但吾人日常所需、可以取給國內、不必仰求外來、並可更進一步、以貨眞價廉之物品、供給於國人、以使生活費用、不致上漲、而爲全般國民經濟、作切實之改善、（三）利便軍運、軍隊之組織、譬如一座機器、鐵道交通、卽爲此機器中閒一輪齒、兵法云、兵貴神速，如伺使軍隊軍實之運輸、不失機宜、實爲鐵路之責任、故鐵路在平時應時時考究設備、訓練員工、於物質精神、並加準備、使其設施、能盡軍事運輸之職機、斯亦爲鐵道員工全髒所負之任務、以上所述、前二者爲平時所當注意、後者爲戰時所應努力、若就國家安危關係之重要性言之、當以後者爲要、蓋人民必先安居而後樂業、能樂業而後有生產、有旅行、若不能安其居、樂其業、何來貨物運輸、有何閒情旅行、故如伺充實國力、</p>
<p>鞏固國防</p>
<p>使人民安居樂業、實爲克盡一切責任之前提、惟普通提起「國防」二字、視若軍隊之事、殊不知國者人之積也、惟人人能盡力於本職、方能講究國防、亦唯人人能報效於國家、方能業固國防、故國防也者、乃全國國民無分男女·無閒老幼。上下內外一體之責任、决不可亦决不能推諉於他人、先哲有曰、「天下興亡、匹夫有責」、惟如何克盡國民之責任、不但人人能言之、能知之、必須身體之、力行之、知而不行、等於不知、力行之道、唯有抱定「國家至高無上」、併集全副精力、於整個國家的利益之下、犧牲小我、成全大我、進言之、吾人服務鐵道、卽須認淸目標、克盡職賣、一旦事變非常、卽須抱定决心、</p>
<p>盡力軍蓮</p>
<p>爲國犧牲、在所不惜、誠能如此、方不負鐵道員工應有之使命、方足以盡國民應盡之職責、目下國際風雲、劍拔弩張、各國皆有非常機關之設立、以防非常事變於萬一、如蘇聯之國防後援協會、鐵道員工、皆爲該會會員、卽所以謀國防思想之普及、與軍事訓練之實施、使鐵道員工與後方民衆、互相携手、共同盡力於軍隊以外之軍事敎育、如交通·運輸·宣傳·防空·防毒·等項工作、目下此國防後援協會、巳成爲蘇聯半軍性組織中最强有力之團體、綜計會員人數、達一千二百萬人以上、而鐵道員工、的占百分之六十、他若軍事智識研究會·射擊研究會·等等、對軍事敎育與軍事訓練、無不有極嚴格之設施、而鐵道員工、又爲其中最主要之份子、良以鐵道與國防之　係最密、一旦軍興、如何使人馬糧彈、依照作戰計書、迅安輸送、集中指定地點、爲作戰上最緊要之事、又如負傷兵士之後、送戰地難民之保護、以及軍實軍需之供應等、亦莫不藉運輸機關、適應機宜、而益得充分保養、持久作戰能力、</p>
<p>歐戰之時</p>
<p>法國北部及東部之鐵道運輸、僅一九一五年一畫夜、出動一八〇列車、一九一六年二三一列車、一九一八年二六七列車、因軍需軍實輸送之迅捷、遂得確保出征軍隊戰鬥之能力、今後戰爭之劇烈性、恐將數倍於曩昔、以是軍事運輸、於戰爭動作中、益占重要地位、鐵道員工、對國防將負何等重大責任、可按而思焉、吾國目下尙無類似國防後援會等等之組織、諸位來此受訓、卽所以替代是項工作（須知吾國國灘臨頭、死裏求活、端在自力更生、更生之道、唯有居安思危、及時準備然後事變之來、方能從容鎮定、應付一切、要知時代之進展無一已、而鐵道之責任、亦隨之而增、隨之而變、卽隨之加重、在前全國動員至多數十萬人、今後一旦事作、何止數百萬人、試問目下吾人已吾有此訓練、對於大規模之運輸、已否胸有成竹、能否切實擔當、益以近代科學昌明、戰爭利器、日新月異、海陸航空之戰、已由平面進至立體之爭、故軍事動員、允宜如何迅捷、運輸之時、如何妥策安全、若非事前認眞準備、斷非臨時所可佈置、故今日如何在智能上設備上·切實準備、實爲鐵道員工每人之資任、事變之來、不能預測、一旦發生、唯有竭盡智能、捨身報國、更須具備全般的智識、以爲各個部門之應用、設在鐵道路軌、一旦被人自空中破壞、不能專靠工務機務之人擔任修理、必須人人具此才能、隨時補救、然後臨到緊急關頭之時、一人可出二人之力、一事可作二事之用、</p>
<p>現代作戰非僅僅爲武力之戰、且爲人力·物力·財力·之戰、申言之、亦卽爲各個國民能否切實盡責之戰、故今日在此、與諸君發言、余實有無窮之感慨、與無窮之期望、深願諸位、萬勿以單純的鐵道員工自居、必須人人自列爲中華民國大國民之一、無論和戰、均有準備、均能盡責、余於鐵道事業、本非素習、忝長以來、殊知鐵道事業、千頭萬緒、不知從何做起、方能克盡其應盡之使命、惟以今日國家所處之時間與空閒言之、當以國防第一責任、個人之所以日常不輟、勉力求治、唯恐不及者在此、而今日希望諸君自强不息、精益求精、更加邁進者亦在此、目下各項之精神紀律、其未盡如人意之處、不容諱言、惟念風氣之轉移、端賴少數人以爲中心、首爲倡導、然後潛移默化、普遍的推行於大衆、諸位在此受訓、期滿之後、均將回歸各路、以所受者授諸人、故諸位在此、爲數睢僅及數百、惟其責任與影響、實在千人萬人之上、深期諸位持其志母暴其氣、認定吾人應有之信念、與應盡之使命、而固守之、實踐之、庶幾國民之責任可盡、國家之危難可紓矣、</p>

<h3>陶桂林談　水泥漲價問題</h3>
<p>中央社記者、昨見報載水泥公司營業現狀、特趨訪營造業陶桂林君、據其發表意見如下、水泥廠商圾近兩次漲價、每桶全數已達六元有奇、其原因未詳、惟查廿四年度市價、每桶袋裝、售目（廿四年上半年平均每桶五元五角、下半年每桶平均三元五角）平均祇四元五角、但是中國水泥公司年終結算報告、除官利紅利折舊等、提出甚鉅外、尙有充分之盈餘、揆諸實際、則水泥成本與售價以四元五角二、或可爲適當之數也、以現今之貨價與上年之貨價比較、相去甚昂、其理由何在、鄙人未敢斷言、邇近水泥銷數激增、無非多爲國家建設所需用、鄙人以爲水泥廠商應增其產額、以供需求、而對成本方面、因產額增加、或可减輕其貨價、以輕政府之擔負、倘水泥廠商乘機漲價、則國家直接蒙重大之負擔、而敝同業間接受無形之損失、然而彼此均屬國人、尙無外溢之虞、惟在此嚴重時期、敝同業極願與水泥廠商互相維助、同舟共濟、爲國家服務、此敝人之願望、或亦全國同胞應有之熱忱耳、最後陶君之希望、水泥廠商能有適當標準之定價、免去貨價不一、則建築業亦可得沽價上之保障云、</p>

<p>舉世矚目之第十一屆世界運動大會、閉幕巳久了、回想德人籌備的完備、塲地佈置的新穎、觀衆的熱烈、秩序的良好、以及大會各項運動紀錄的突飛猛晋、這個具有歷史意味的偉大史蹟、是多麽値得稱頌、很可紀念的偉業、軍歌興歡聲交響、會旗與國旗齊揮數十萬的人　攢勤、湧現着諸色人種族的人氣、空前盛况、深刻的印入觀衆的腦海、誰也不能忘却，只有憧憬地回憶、永遠的記着、永遠的念着、德國自希特勒秉政後、有第三德意志之稱、民族復興、國家强盛、誰稱道、此次會開柏林、各項建設、各種組織、無不表眩英新國家的精神、埋頭實幹、苦心硏究實在令人歎服、會塲各部建築的需三千萬以上參加國家五十二國、男女選手五千餘人、到會表演體育及各國靑年訓練人員、其數在十萬以上、而大會裁判員為一千二百人、助理裁判亦為一千二百人、辦公人員四百人、其他襄助大會事務如辦理交通郵電等、其數亦在一萬二千以上、</p>
<p>此次大會、不特表演體育運動比賽精神、以覘各國健兒運動技術成績、同時有各國體育表演、及盛大的集會、如體育展覽會及藝術興科學展覽、一以表演世運精神、一以表演德國復興精神、而在漢堡舉行的休閒娛樂討論會、阿烏斯的國際運動　員營、以及數千男女兒童與靑年的大團體體操表演、整個的大會、除注意運動比賽外、又能顧到體育理論的研討與演講、此實為歷屆世運所不及、柏林亞令匹克大會的鐘聲、歡迎了各國健兒、回歸祖國、而大會技術與精神、是櫃續不斷的發揚，會歌與會徽、是永遠的留着、一九四〇年、此種人種體育運動表演、將在日本東京舉行了、鑒往策來、吾們應如何淬厲、努力的充分的準備、</p>
<p>吾國此次參與世運大會、代表團一行共一百四十一人、浩浩蕩蕩、組織偉大歐洲各國人士、以及柏林民衆、很注意我們的運動、選手代表參加各項運動、無不竭其所能、盡力做夫、無奈體格不如人、元力不如人、以致比賽運動、項項落後、處處失敗、國際竸武場中、未能抬頭揚眉、記分板上的旗竿、輸不到我們國旗升揚、現在且莫怨天尤人、只怪我華種族衰弱、</p>
<p>在凄風苦雨中、我們代表團離開了柏林、至十月三日回抵上海、敗軍之將、辱國之師、遭人譏諷、受人嘲笑、夫復何言、尙忍言哉、常聞人言、當一個運動選手代表易、做一個國際向無成績的國家選手代表難，勝固可喜、敗難見人、這幾句話、是不啻為此次吾國出席世運選手而發、也許選手們心中所欲言者、噫、壯志未遂、內心抑鬱、再向那裏訴苦呢、</p>
<p>雖然、失敗的事實、是畢竟當在我們的眼前、熱嘲冷笑、是失敗後的好敎訓、吾們要在失敗中找出一條致勝之路、才進洗雪失敗的恥辱、</p>
<p>悠悠歲月、代表團回國已一月餘矣、如何奮發圖進、想體育當局、正在設計　備中、現在且把世運會後的重要問題先來提出討論、</p>
<p>（一）要有一個健全的體育行政組織</p>
<p>體育行政組織、為一切體育事業的骨幹、迹其演進的歷程、大都趨向政治的組織、用政府最大的决心、藉政治的力量、决定一個精密健全的體育行政組織、以爲推行的動力機關、思想集中、步調一致、由政府指撥常年事業應用經費、迎頭幹上、則我華民族體育事業、或有進展之望、現在我國最高體育行政組織、、敎育部有體育組及全國體育委員會、辦理全國學校體育、社會體育、及童子軍與軍訓事宜、中央民訓部、有體育指導科、及國民體育計委員會、辦理各級黨部及民衆團體體育指導事宜、訓練總監部、又有體育科之設置、注意軍隊體育事業之推進、殊途同歸、指導與發展其所各掌之體育事業、惟行政組織略有不同、事實上推行事業、難免有疊床架屋之勢、日溝通機會殊少、有失蓮繫進展之力、我們要參照各國體育行政趨勢、適應吾華民族迫切需要、來建設一個書時代的體育行政組織、上月七日、中央民訓部第一次國民體育設計委負會議、關於中央體育行政組、有集中上項三部分併合組織之建議、由全國最高領袖統制、此案大意如此交付審查、倘能如願、則我國體育應興應革事宜、推行方面、定有成效、在中央監督指導之下、於最短期間、完成省市體育行政組、則一切推行事業、易收指臂之效、</p>
<p>（二）學校體育</p>
<p>各級學校體育課程內容、及各學年作業要項、在敎育部頒布以後、遵辦厲行者固多、而敷衍因循者亦有之、大學方面、不宜放棄而任其目由、應嚴格普及體育運動、大學一二年級、每週至少有兩小時驟育為必修科、高中初中、應遵照部令辦理、軍訓童訓時間、不應侵佔原有體育時間、課外活動、戶外生活、尤應積極提創、小學體育科內容有改進之必要、應詳訂各學年作業要項、並須厘訂體育標準、以養成刻苦·耐勞·勇敢·服從·活潑·快樂·等美德、試行標準測騐、凡不能達到標準者、不得升舉或畢業、此外靑年訓練與靑年勞働服務、亦當努力倡導、以為保國强種之基、</p>
<p>（三）社會體育</p>
<p>歐美人運動習慣養成、運動興趣濃厚、兒童靑年以及社會各界、多富有運動習慣、人才輩出、理有固然、我國體育運動、彷彿是學校學生所佔有、社會民衆、很少顧問因此、社會體育、亦是最難辦有成效的一件事、如何造成濃厚的運動空氣為推行民衆體育的先覺問題、體育從業人員、必須要深人民衆、接近民衆、歡迎民衆到塲運動、同時考察地方物質環境、分佈設置小規模的體育塲、舉行運動比賽、及體育表演、關於民俗運動、又應多多提創、使體育塲成為一個推行體育事業的中心、並為民衆敎育的施行的中心機關、使民衆認識體育重要的意義、遂漸養成其愛好運動的風尙、我想毫無捉摸的民衆體育事業、終有達到我們所企求的一天、親愛的同胞們、我們的體格、是够不上與歐美人較量的、將來東京亞會、我華民族、能否揚眉吐氣、全在此時早日的準備、快快的準備、（完）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗價前市跌得兇　後市賴現銷有力　回漲一元五六角</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、但趨勢略形和綏、然大都心理、對於紗價一致看漲、故一跌則回、現紗交易、南部粵帮購買尙健、粗紗占多數、標紗初以某君在近期出籠六千包、本月破進三十元關、午後漸漸復升、但大阪三品紗市平平、</p>
<p>大戶在近月做作甚力</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月因上日漲風太急、天津帮獲利了結、市價轉趨下挫、遠月隨之下降、賡豐合興多頭大批出籠、但市塲空氣、一致看漲、且大戶在近月做作甚力、然二百三十三元高過現紗價之頭、有一部分多頭了結、檯面略鬆、步步下墮、標紗結果、本月比上日收盤價跌三元半、遠跌一元至一元半、午後開盤、本月亢堅、二盤轉平、迨至三收盤、聞現紗交易仍有一千包外、近期又復回升、結果近月比上午收盤價漲一元五六角、遠漲四五角、查賣出大孚一千七百包、合興四千二百五十包、明華一千零五十包、慶豐四千二百包、森康三千二百五十包、長豐一千六百五十包、大昶一千四百五十包、長餘八百五十包、瑞大七百包、振大六百包、買進裕大一千一百包、同孚一千一百五十包、恒益一千零五十包、裕康九百五十包、明德二千六百五十包、華懋二千一百五十包、豐泰一千七百包、望泰興一千五百五十包、協成一千包、大昌成一千九百包、一日間行市比較於後、</p>

<h3>期花無期紗之堅　因現貨來源甚多</h3>
<p>棉市趨疲、市態甚弱、因北路來貨擁擁、每日有二·三·萬擔抵滬、因此人心不振、惟多方仍無舉動、而海外棉業狀况、疲憊不佳、中央農業實驗所估計、本年全國棉產量、為一二、一三一、〇〇〇市擔、</p>
<p>北路花到貨不絕</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因海外棉市一味下落、且各路來源擁擠、北路棉花每日有二·三·萬担到滬、於是買者缺乏、市盤乃鬆動、惟有一部份因紗市堅昂、拉緊不放、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌四·五角、午後開盤、氣勢平常、因棉產豐稔、做多者减少、二盤稍振作、三盤平平、結果各月比上午收盤價再跌五分、查賣出合興八千九百担、大孚一千二百担、裕大四千二百扣、賡豐六千七百祖、興昌一千七百祖、仁豐二千二百担長和四千担、森泰一千九百祖、大昌成三千七百担潤康一千四百担、買進源大二千三百担、大豐一千　、明德三千九百祖、　昌千九百担、益昶一千担、長豐一千八百担、生源二千四百担、源興昌五千二百担、昶記二千三百担、茲將一日間行巿列後、</p>

<h3>海外紗花無一不跌</h3>
<p>昨美折開盤、市况呆滯、各月漲跌二磅音、利物浦消息不利、但為同業及外商買進所推翻、旋以多頭了結、棉農套賣、傳聞美棉合作社預估新棉達一千二百三十萬包、巿價轉疲、業外需要平淡、同業大半等候政府估計、其後同業繼續買進十二月期、同時布疋需要活動、賣氣漸衰、市價乃得站住、收盤時、套賣及多頭了結再見、價又回落、計現貨跌七磅音、期貨跌四至九磅音、英棉現貨跌二點、期貨跌三四點、印棉空戶賣出、歐洲出口商買進、計平果爾跌〇·二五至〇·七五羅比、奧姆辣跌〇·七五至一羅比、白羅公跌半羅比、原　　左、（六日電）</p>

<h3>玩具</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>前見本報所載的天津電訊說：「據海關調查，本年一至九月，日玩具品輸入華北，總値的五百萬元，較去年增百分三十五」云云。</p>
<p>在下看了上面這樣一段電訊，覺得「玩具」，本來是小朋友的恩物。也可以說，凡是小朋友，莫不愛「玩具」。這並非我們敝國的小朋友如此，就是人家貴國小朋友，也是這樣的喜歡「玩具」。那麽，我們歡迎人家的「玩具」，只要我們有「玩具」，人家也一樣會來歡迎的，區區「五百萬元」，有什麽稀罕？</p>
<p>不過，所可怕者是，人家的「玩具」，能彀騙取咱們的金錢。而咱們的「玩具」，不但不能彀騙取人家的金錢。倒反給人家利用了來作為一種侵略的「玩具」！</p>
<p>唉！有人問在下說：這是一種什麽樣的「玩具」？是狗呢？是豬呢？在下說：這是類乎的一種「玩具」，便是那些「漢奸」和傀儡囉！</p>
<h3>兒童掌故隨談</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>孝武改哭</p>
<p>簡文帝崩了，孝武帝卽位，那時他的年紀祇有十歲多一點。皇家的規矩，老皇帝新崩，小皇帝必須在每天暮時到靈位前去哭泣的，名為「哭臨」——哭泣被定為禮節了。可是孝武帝不大去哭臨。左右的人們只道他年幼不懂規矩，便向他說明了，請他守禮每天去哭臨。孝武說說道：「心頭感覺到悲哀自然會哭出來。這哭泣的事情，怎麼也能够勉强着天天照辦的呢？」他還是「我行我素」地逢到眞情要哭了纔往靈前，並不按時舉行哭禮。</p>
<p>禮節原是根據着人情而創設的。不過世俗的禮節奉行得太呆板了反成矯情，更顯得頗有滑稽的色彩咧！但瞧現在普通人家舉行的喪禮：弔客走到靈位前時，贊禮者高聲吆喝，孝幃裏的哭聲立刻繼之而起，一片號啕放縱地熱鬧着，名為舉哀；待到贊禮者的吆喝聲完，那哭鬧的聲響也便很迅速地收滅了。這樣地循環起落形成定律，那個贊禮者不是直可稱為「哭司令」了麽？其他種種可笑的禮節多不勝舉，是極應該量情改革，不用拘泥遵守着的。孝武指斥那腐敗的禮節，毅然自行其是，是純出於孩子的天眞；在那崇奉禮敎的中古時代，身居為臣民表率的帝皇地位，這等行為允屬不易多得！今人對於禮節固無須拘俗違情，也不必矯枉過正甚至於完全罷廢，祗在認定情理而行便得了。</p>
<h3>糞</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>「黃金萬兩」有人這樣地稱它！雖然糞是一樣令人見而生畏的臭東西，但是它能用作肥料以助稻禾，長出黃金一般的穀米來，郤是它有功於人的實證！</p>
<p>我們從嘴裏送入的食物，先由口腔中分泌一種唾液，使澱粉變為可溶性的糖質：胃部中分泌一種胃液，使蛋白質消化；腸內存留着的旭汁和膵液又能使脂肪消化，而被消化後的食品，再經腸膜和血管而送至全身各部的細胞，但是在腸中不能吸收的物質就變成了糞！由排泄腔內排泄而出！</p>
<p>講到糞，它的成份也很多：</p>
<p>（一）未經消化的食物殘質（如脂肪，蛋白質和碳水化合物）</p>
<p>（二）不能消化的物質（（如纖維質，葉綠素等）</p>
<p>（三）難消化的物質（如生澱粉，憐酸鹽等）</p>
<p>（四）各種細菌及腸黏膜的死細胞</p>
<p>（五）胆汁的殘質</p>
<p>由糞便，我們可以造成許多植物質的食品，這是所謂「取之於人」復「用之於人，」如此循環不已！</p>
<p>小朋友，你們不要看輕了糞！雖然它是一樣臭東西！</p>
<h3>紡績娘</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>紡續娘，</p>
<p>嗚嗚呌；</p>
<p>徹夜紡積聲，</p>
<p>惟肖又惟妙；</p>
<p>似與不合作主義的甘地表同情，</p>
<p>把恢復民族的經濟自由來號召；</p>
<p>紡車是他的隨身伴侶，</p>
<p>搖着紡車是他的每天工作；</p>
<p>一片提倡國貨聲，</p>
<p>此唱彼和眞熱閙；</p>
<p>到秋深，</p>
<p>落葉西風早；</p>
<p>它們都匿迹銷聲，</p>
<p>却無半絲半縷充作寒衣料；</p>
<p>事到臨頭，</p>
<p>想自救也自救不了，</p>
<p>這病根在能說不能行，</p>
<p>只顧一味唱空頭高調；</p>
<p>莫唱空頭高調！</p>
<p>莫唱空頭高調！</p>
<p>凡事要脚踏實地去做才好。</p>
<h3>小討論</h3>
<p>— 詠仁</p>
<p>天漸漸地暗下去了。</p>
<p>智兒和德兒坐在天井裏，講着故事來消遣，忽然有一隻蝙蝠飛得怪低的，從德兒的頭上掠過，這一掠，似乎啟動了德兒的疑竇：他立刻問智兒道：</p>
<p>「哥哥！這蝙蝠，有人說是飛禽，有人說是走獸，你說究竟屬於那一類？」</p>
<p>「你試猜猜看！究竟是什麼？」智兒含了笑反問德兒。</p>
<p>「我說蝙蝠是飛奮：德兒斷定的說。</p>
<p>「為什麼呢」？</p>
<p>「它有着翅翼來飛翔，這不是飛禽的證據嗎？」</p>
<p>「暖，你錯了！它用來飛的，並不是翅翼　曰不過它的前趾很長，各趾間張着皮來聯絡，所以看上去就像翅翼了。</p>
<p>蝙蝠沒有禽類的尖喙，而有獸類的嘴唇和牙齒；它身上遮着的不是羽而是毛：它有很長的耳朶；且又不會生蛋，所以粗看蝙蝠的形狀好像是飛禽，其實它却是獸　呀！」</p>
<h3>糖裏有炭質的，你相信嗎？</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>我們每天吃的甜蜜蜜的白糖，裏面却含着很多的炭質。這句話表面看來有些怪誕不經，但是事實上是千眞萬確，一些不哄人的：糖裏確實是含有炭質的，不信，我們可以把裏面的炭質想法拿出來。</p>
<p>我們可以從廚房裏拿出一茶匙調味用的白糖來，放在香烟罐，或是別的馬口鐵罐的蓋裏：然後用鐵鉗鉗了那蓋，放在酒精燈的火焰上，或是煤爐炭爐上，加力的燒。燒的時候，那白糖逐漸烊去，化做棕色的液體，最後就燒做一種黑色的固體。這種黑色的東西，放在舌上亦嘗不出什麽味兒來，而且放在火裏亦會自己發光而燃燒的；這東西是什麽？就是我們上面所說的「炭」了。</p>
<p>事實最雄辯，做了上面那個小試騐，我們親手從甜蜜蜜的糖裏面，提出烏黑炭來；我們就可以很放心的相信糖裏是確實含有炭質的，不過這糖裏面的炭因為已經變了樣兒，所以我們就不認識罷了。</p>
<p>現在可以把這伴事，記進記事冊裏面去。</p>
<h3>因果</h3>
<p>— 戶人</p>
<p>一隻跑得氣吁吁的狐狸，後面跟了一頭獵犬，及一個獵人，也在急急地跟在後面，狐狸雖然跑得極快，可是獵犬也毫不肯放鬆它。</p>
<p>狐狸跑了許多時候，遇見了一個樵夫，在對面挑了一担柴渡過來。「老伯伯！請你……救……我一救　後面……獵狗……追來了！它帶着很可憐的神情求着。『不行，你前天偸了我兩頭小鷄，你這可惡的東西，現在倒求我了？』它說完頭也不回地去了。狐狸便很失望地趕它的路。</p>
<p>狐狸又跑了許多路，看見羊媽媽正在屋前縫衣服，它便又很可憐的哀告着『羊奶奶！請你發個……慈悲，讓我……在你家中藏一藏……後面獵入在追着』『呸！你這壞種！又來了！前天晚上偸了我一個兒子，今天又來了嗎？』伊眼中好像發火般的怒撲過去。狐狸只得回頭再逃命。</p>
<p>狐狸經過了兩决停留後，和獵狗的距離更近了。</p>
<p>它看見一隻花貓在地上打睡，『貓小姐，請……你……快快……救我！……獵人來……了！』『噓！不行！你是我們村中的最壞的東西，去，快去！』</p>
<p>『砰！』一聲，狐狸應聲而倒，獵犬奔上去一口便咬住了。</p>
<h3>骨氣</h3>
<p>— 齋夫</p>
<p>「骨氣」兩個字，是代表做入的風格的。我們稱讚意志堅强，人品高尙的人為「有骨氣」：意志脆弱，品格卑污的人為「沒有骨氣」。古來忠臣義士，堅貞節烈的人，都是有骨氣的人：忘恩負義，賣國求榮的人，都是沒骨氣的人。皮肉是柔軟的，人若沒有骨頭，只是一團皮肉，如何能直立行動！骨頭倘不堅實，如何能任重致遠！</p>
<p>明朝時節，為奸臣嚴嵩害死的忠臣楊椒山有一副聯語：「鐵肩擔道義，辣手著文章。所謂「鐵肩」，「辣手」，便是指忠義之士的骨氣則言。</p>
<p>歷代的亡國，每有並不是亡在敵人手裏，而是亡在一般絕無骨氣甘為敵人走狗的漢奸手裏。</p>
<p>好好一個國民，為何要去做漢奸？沒有衣穿，沒有飯吃嗎？殷汝耕之流，原來也是受命於本國政府的錦衣玉食的官吏，他何嘗爲飢寒所迫！不過是生來不曾養就一副做人的骨氣便了。</p>
<p>「疾風知勁草，世亂識忠臣。」有骨氣的人，愈是處境艱苦，遭遇亂世，愈是要顯出他盡忠報國的節操。</p>
<p>要做個未來的忠義之士，便要在兒童時代養成忠義的骨氣；要養成忠義的骨氣，必須具備下面這幾項立身的信條：</p>
<p>不貪愛奢華！</p>
<p>不作非分的妄想！</p>
<p>不為强暴所屈！</p>
<p>不欺懦弱貧苦的人！</p>
<p>不愛錢！</p>
<p>不怕死！</p>

<h3>演說練習</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>任任何人要　達自己的意思，而想博得別人的瞭解與同情，不可少的，是很能動人的演說。在政治家們的選舉競爭中，最有效的利器，便是用演說，以宣佈自己的抱負與政策，使聽衆對他都有一個很好的印象，而很同情地對他投着選舉票。政治家是如此，學術家，也是如此。有精深研究的學術家，一方面，果可用文字發表他的研究之所得，但同時”也須有優良的演說本領，以備應學校或團體，請往演說時之用。就是一位實業家，製成了優良貨品之後，也需要有優良的演說，為宜傳之一助。總之，不拘是將來服務於那主張每一小朋友，都得努力於演說的練習。</p>
<p>在練習演說時，最難的一步，是站上了演說台，能旁若無人的說話。大凡練習演說者，未在未上台時，總是心中很有主意的預備就了很充分的說話，待到踏上了演說台，瞧着台下十對，或是幾百對眼睛，都向自己的臉上直射着，便會得突然的臉上發着赤，心裏猛烈的震跳着，嘴是似乎給封住着，張不開來。心中越急，話越是說不出，就是勉强說幾句，台下也很難聽得明白。這種情形，是初習演說者，所具有的通病。但這種羞怯病，是不難剷除的。第一次台演說，失敗了，不用氣沮，第二次，還是鼓足了勇氣上台。第三次，第四次的再接再厲，最多，也决不會過第十回，準能把面皮練老，絕對的不會發赤，把心兒練得鎮定，絕對的不會因站上了演說台，而劇烈地跳躍着。到那時，雖然站在數十對，或是數百對眼睛的前面，也儘能若無其事的把要說的話，一一的從嘴裏，宣述出來。</p>
<p>演說的村料，不拘好壞，最要緊的，是像作文那麽的要有層次，使聽者能聽得頭頭是道，而感到淸晰而明瞭。若能在各層次中，更挿入些有趣味的故事，或穿挿，使聽者無枯　之感，那自然是更好了。所以最好在演說之前，預先摘錄幾條演說的大意，那麽演說時，便不至於有舛錯了。演說時的姿勢，須力求莊重與自然，絕對的不顯出勉强的做作態度來。聲音，不宜太高，也不可太低，因為太低了，果然不能使聽衆聽明白，太高了，也不能在聽衆的耳膜上，發生出諧和而悅耳的音韻來。最適當的，是僅較普通的話說，響着一半，已很够了。演說時，把頭略略的仰高些，也可助聽波較大的擴展開來。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們也想將來成為一位演說家麽？演說，並不是一件難事。你們若是高興，可在自己級裏，每星開舉行一次或二次的演說練習，一二年後，已能很有經騐了。</p>
<h3>絲綢是從那裏來的？</h3>
<p>— 楊志剛</p>
<p>我們穿的衣服，有的是用棉布做的，有的是用絲綢做的，有的是用……我想其中小朋友們最喜歡的一定是用絲綢做的衣服吧！不過有許多小朋友對於絲綢的來歷，却是不知道，現在我來　給你們聽聽：</p>
<p>最先把一張張的　子（圖一），拿了去孵，不多天便孵出來了許多小蠶（圖二），小蠶孵出了之後，就連忙去採桑葉來（圖二）採來的桑葉太大，小蠶吃不下，所以要把它切成細粒（圖四），把切細後的桑葉餵給小蠶（圖五）吃。過了幾天，小蠶就開始睡了！隔了多天，一起連續眠了四次（圖六）。第四次睡過了！就要上簇，在簇上開始結繭（圖七）。把繭取下來繅絲（圖八）。把繅下來的絲，用機器織成綢緞（圖九）。</p>
<p>綢緞的出產，我國很多，而尤以浙江等省為最多。全國每年運銷到外國去的亦不少）圖十）。</p>
<p>不過現在絲綢，一落千丈，歸納原因，不外乎人造絲的充滿市場，絲綢出產的惡劣。結果，非但不能廣銷到國內，並且又不能推銷到國外。回頭去一看東鄰的日本，他們的養　方法，本來是從我或方面學去的，但是因為他們會硏究，知道改良所以成績很好。我們必須努力研究，努力改良才是啊</p>
<h3>孝（三）</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>然而柏絲可菲很信任天心的仁慈，旣已給了伊那張可貴的護照，那麼一定也會替伊打破其他種種困難的；伊一方面旣信任上天，而一方面也富於自信力，以為只須立志堅定，無論甚麼阻力都不算一回事的，末後伊終於得到了父母的允許，預定九月八日出發。</p>
<p>這一一套，天剛發亮，伊已裝束妥帖，肩上掮着一隻小小的皮袋，伊的父親想把家裏所有唯一的銀羅布要伊帶去，伊郤不肯收受說這一些錢實在不够給伊做彼得堡去的旅費，還是留最家中，也許有需用的時候，但伊父親很嚴厲的命令伊收下，伊沒法，只得受了。另有兩個在窮苦的鄰人，定要把他們所有的錢送給伊，一共是三十個銅古貝和一個二十古貝的銀幣，可是伊堅决的拒絕了。只向他們道謝這一番好意，並且很誠懇的答應他們，量力相助，也許有同被赦免的希望。</p>
<p>當那第一道陽光射到房間裏的時候，就照着俄羅斯美麗的古俗，有一個短時期的莊嚴的靜默，給旅人禱祝一路平安。於是又彼此說了幾句話，作最後一次的擁抱，柏絲可菲便屈膝跪下，接受伊父母的祝福，然後立起身來，毅然决然的動身出鬥——一個十九歲的女孩子，衣袋裏只帶着一個銀羅布，徒步走過一叢叢廣大的森林，遠迢迢地趕往彼得堡去，見那尊嚴的皇帝。</p>
<p>那兩個可憐的鄰人，為表示親善起見，特地伴送伊走出伊吉村，直到遇見了一羣女孩子，恰好和伊同路，要到一個小村子裏去的，便托伊們好好照顧，然後叮嚀別去。路上被幾個半醉的靑年打攪了一會，曾受了一些小驚嚇；但伊們終於把他們趕走了。達到了那個小村子裏面，柏絲可菲就在那邊安然的過宿。第二天早上，伊覺得很是疲倦，可是出發之後，想到了一路上的寂寞，不免有些害怕，然而一想起天使的默佑，勇氣頓時來了；但是伊因為路途不熟，白白的走了好一會，仍然回到了昨夜過宿的村子裏。伊停辛佇苦的一路前去，仍免不了常常迷路，每向人們問那前往彼得堡的路時，大家總是對着伊笑。伊也不知道最近的地方是呌什麽名字，所知道的不過是俄人所稱爲聖鎭的基府一處，心想一定也須經過的；於是每逢人家回說不知道到彼得堡去的路時，伊就忙着問上基府去，是怎樣走的。有一天伊到了一個三又路口，見有幾個旅客坐了一輛馬車經過，伊就趕上去問，那一條路是通往基府去的。他們笑着答道：「任你歡喜走那一條，都好，這三條路無論上基府，上巴黎，或是上羅馬都可以走的。」伊沒奈何，挑了中間的一條路走去，幸而沒有走錯。不過沿　經過的村子，却一個都弄不淸楚。伊每到一個小村子裏，向人家茅屋中求宿時，往往得到較好的待遇，可是一到了大地方，人家就當伊是一個形跡可疑的女子，而不肯招留了。</p>

<h3>自然科學的危機</h3>
<p>— 思敬</p>
<p>現在的世界，充滿了危機。有政治的危機，有經濟的危機，奇怪的就是成為科學（包括自然科學社會科學等）之軌範的自然科學，也有了危機！</p>
<p>我想，一般未加深究的人一定會驚異：近幾百年來，不是自然科學萬能的時代嗎？人類社會近三百年來的進步同以前的幾千年相比，都有過之無不及；物質生活之改善，生產力之發達，文明之一日千里，這不是自然科學之所賜嗎？而且社會愈往前走，那各種發明和發見更是層出不窮。這樣看來，自然科學不僅是文明之母，而同時其前途又似乎非常興隆，决說不上有危機的話。</p>
<p>但是你如果從另一方面去看，那又會使你驚異的：不怕自然科學怎樣進步，但是我們還親眼看見許多本身就是大科學家，而且在科學上還有發明和發現的人，他們自身就優疑起科學來了。他們認為科學不是「究竟之學」，不能徹底研究出宇宙的「眞諦」來，而且科學本身就會走到絕境，自己就發見出了自己的虛偽，破滅。因此科學不可靠了，要另求之於神，宗敎。比如海森堡，愛丁頓，秦斯諸現代大科學家便是這樣說。他們從科學的硏究上證明了客觀宇宙之為虛幻，只有主觀上的存在。由波動力學之發達而成立了「無定原理」，因之否認了客觀世界中的因果必然法則；由電學之發達而建立了一物質消滅了」的理論；由力學硏究之進步而達到了「質能分立論」，「能力獨存論一等等學說：其他如因相對論之成立，則說時間空間只存在於觀測者的主觀上：諸如此類，都表示出自然科學的理論正在證明宇宙之非實有。</p>
<p>自然科學之所以比其他各種科學先達到科學的階段，原是因為牠所研究的對象是客觀的有形有質的物質界，而不像社會科學或思維科與所研究的對象比較變化莫測，不易把握，剖析。而且自然科學的方法也是實證的，如歸納法，實騐法等等。總之，自然科學原是唯物論的，所以容易成為科學的。但是為甚麽現在反而走不通，不能節進，而要遁入玄學的泥淖中，以求歸依於神和宗敎呢？這眞的是自然科學本身的危機嗎？</p>
<p>很顯然的，現在人類所造成的或正在加工製造的罪惡——戰爭，其猛烈，其殘酷，完全是受了科學的幫助，因之，有許多悲天憫人的人道主義者便以為這是科學本身的罪過。但是實際上科學對於人類是有益的，至於牠之帮助了人類的殘殺，這幷不是科學自身的罪過，而是利用科學來謀其自身的利益，以毀滅他人因之也毀滅人類的那些社會上少數人的罪惡。同樣，自然科學的危機幷不是牠自身所必然發生而無法避免的東西，而是一般自然科學者為自己的社會層所局限，不能把握着進步不巳的自然科學，因其歪曲的宇宙觀，因其機械的，陳窳的方法論，不惟不能促進科學之發展，還反而阻止了牠。</p>
<p>自然科學和藝術學文學等同樣，都是社會的上層建築。而且自然科學比其他的意識形態更和生產力有直接的關係，更易促進生產力，與牠以反作用。因為如此，那下層建築的生產力如一發生桎梏，不能遂其發展時，那與牠直接相關聯着的自然科學便也因之陷於停頓或危機中了。現在的經濟恐慌，政治危機，完全是由於社會制度之生產關係妨礙了生產力的發展之所致，間接也阻止了自然科學之發展。舉例說，生產力本來可以一直向前發展的，但是在這以營利為目的的資本社會中，一般沒有生產工具只賣勞力的勤苦者，便沒有錢購買那非常進步的機械所生產出的大量的商品，因之便發生了生產過剩的恐慌。在這恐慌中，生產便停頓下來，因之促進生產的技術進步的自然科學也被迫而停滯下來了。因為如科學更進步，則技術更發達，生產更增加，而同時生產更過剩，更恐慌，所以不能不被阻止下來。這便是社會制度的危機反映到自然科學上來的危機，但這决不是自然科學本身的危機。</p>
<p>其次我們看現在自然科學危機的特質是怎樣？十九世紀最後十年因為X綫和鐳以及放射綫的發見，物理學上便發生了巨大的變化。「質量恒存」與「能恒有」二原理似乎都被推翻了。到二十世紀，發見了相對性原理，更增加了一層混亂。似乎只要根據相對論討論質量“能之相等，那頂重要的能便消滅逃避了一樣。那末，達到這樣荒謬的結論是由於甚麽原因呢？這還不是自然科學本身的原因。實際上是因為最初的自然科學，其所硏究的對象還很簡單，對於每一對象的硏究尙不十分深刻，其研究範圍也幷不怎樣廣泛，所以機械論的親點和經騐論的實證方法還够敷用。但是及到新發明一多，到了更深，更大的領域，那從前的局部的，陳舊的，機械的觀點和方法，無論如何都不能駕馭這龐大的材料了。所以結果對於牠所發掘　的材料，不能用已有的方法去剖析，因而　神疑鬼，說「物質消滅了」！「能力獨存」！總之，這是出於觀念論和機械的形式邏輯之所致。這也是由於整個的下層建築之被阻不前，而反映到意識形態上來，便成了主觀論，機械論等。至於自然科學初期的機械的唯物論的觀點，現在也還遺毒於牠而構成其危機的一部分。</p>
<p>那麼，自然科學的危機又要怎樣才能克服呢？這也要分兩方面說：從社會方面來的危機是主要的危機，這不能只是從自然科學本身就可以設法逃脫的，這一定要使生產力不受桎梏，能够自由地前進才行，因之，那就要把現在這束縛生產力發達的生產關係—卽社會制度加以改變，自然科學也方能遂其發展。這就不僅是自然科學上的問題了，而是社會科學上的問題，社會改革的問題了。其决，我們便要輸入新的觀點和新的方法到自然科學的硏究中去，要用更包括的，更有涵蓋性的正確的新顥的方法去研究自然科學。舉例說，如果我們站在物質論的立塲，那「物質消滅了」的結論便不會得出，因為不管你是電氣，是能，是質，是量，總不外是物質的一種存在形式，不過是牠的一種屬性，這些存在形式和屬性不管怎樣變化，總是獨立於我們主體之外的。又如我們使用動的邏輯，那就不會主張「質能分立論」，「能力獨立論」而主張「質能統一論」了，因為一切物質都是存在於運動變化中，一切物質同時又可以相互轉化，同時是這個，而同時又不是這個。如果我們使用了上述觀點和方法，那所謂「無定原理」呵，生物學的突變的問題呵，……，都能獲得正當解决。還有，我們要跟着目然科學的發展去預知其將然的規律，不應死死地故步自封在已成的境界上，完全用過去的去衡量現及未在然的。因為在進步的途中，硏究本身就可以發展其方法的。比如無定原理之提倡，是由於硏究了原子內電子之運動，但原子內的空間有怎樣的機構呢，現尙不得而知。我們就當積極地努力去硏究原子內之極微的空間的機構，那無定原理之說到將來便會不攻自破了。所以在不斷的研究中，同時也製造出若干的錯誤，但同時也將克服若干的錯誤。綜合以上幾種方法，自然科學的危機也許會歸於消滅吧？</p>

<h3>灤河岸上的大火</h3>
<p>— 玉章</p>
<p>是下午三點鐘了。因有幾小時的空閑，便到校外去散步；沿着城東灤河堤上慢慢地走。大約一點鐘後，我轉回校來，迎面就遇着我的好友志淸。</p>
<p>「叔男！快點！你有些什麽書？趕快去檢查一下！凡「他們」認為不妥的，都快毀滅了罷！」志請又悲痛又着急地對我說。</p>
<p>「什麽事呀？」我迷惘了，不知道他為什麽這樣焦急。</p>
<p>「這……在這兒談，太不方便。到自修室裏來罷——你就會明白了。」他搖搖他的頭，拉了我的手，把我一把拖到自修室去。到自修室去的路上非常寂靜，沒有看見一個同學——只有幾個校役驚驚惶惶地在那兒往來疾走。「發生了什麽事哪？」我走到自修室門前還在不停地猜疑。</p>
<p>在這自修室裏，有不少的同學，有的神色非常狼狽，有的甚至於淚眼注在，要哭出聲來似的，有的唧啣咕咕，不知對自己說些什麽。這些同學都咬緊牙關，在檢查他們自已的書架和書櫥。顯然地是有什麼禍患發生了！紙燒過的氣息，鑽進了我的鼻官裏，引起了人死後燒紙錢的那種不快的戚覺。星當中一堆大火的火焰伸得很高，幾乎要舐着天花板了。同學們一個一個的還在繼續不斷他將他們的書籍，紙片，信札向火堆裏扔，悲痛和怨憤充滿了每一個人的心！這時，我眞如墮入五里霧中。我神經昏亂，只站在那兒呆視他</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>們。我的心老問着：「為什麽在自修室裏燒書？」可是我的口說不出來！我的同學們也不時的回過頭來瞥我，好像不認識我似的。燒完了書的同學匆匆忙忙地走了，雖然想去覓一個避難所，但這塊土地還是掌握在「他們」的手裏呵！停了一會兒，聽見室外起了雜沓的脚步聲。</p>
<p>我頓時從夢中醒來，忙要求志淸告訴我一些原委。</p>
<p>「剛才，我們的校長被冀東政府的憲兵包圍了，他們來查問「敎師聯合會」在澳東運動會上散發傳單的事；同時軍部來電話說他們要來檢查學校，……」志淸話還沒有說完，臉色早已蒼白了。他的聲音刺激他的心，他不能繼續說下去了。</p>
<p>余宙，另外一個同學在火爐間燒書，聽見了自修室裏的脚步聲，慌慌張張地打開門來四下裏探望。</p>
<p>「余宙！」這是訓育主任焦急的聲音；「不要在自修室裏燒罷—若把房子燒起來了，誰負這個責任呢？而且地上的灰不正是給「他們」更大的疑惑麽？或者……他們就要來了—……」</p>
<p>「哎呀！」我聽見我自己這麼呌出來了。我好像給扔到了冷冰裏似的，我忽然想起我買的「敎育新潮」……來了。這些都是「他們」認為遠禁，寫在警察局的吿示上的。</p>
<p>「這太危險了！」我想；便立刻去打開我的書櫥，把所有的雜誌和着某報館來的信札，信封，「敎育新潮」以及我自己的文稿都拖了出來。我一再仔細檢查過，然後請志淸帮我一道去毀滅。「來罷，我們到老虎灶燒去。」說着，便把志淸拖起走。</p>
<p>老虎灶前已經擠滿了同學，沒有我們挿足的地方了。有兩個同學正在那兒互相生氣，因為有一個要擠上前去。我心裏塞滿了慌亂，「什麽時候才得幹完呢，檢查的也許就要來了！」我想。</p>
<p>茶罐裏的水燒得滾滾熱了。這間小屋充滿了水蒸氣，幾乎對面看不見人。同學們的心和口都被悲痛的大石壓着，房裏沒有一點聲息，只有紙片的焦灼聲和水罐中的太息聲來打破這死一般的沉寂。火大極了，紙灰由烟囱源源不絕地湧出。</p>
<p>我不能再等了。我去蹲在老虎灶房子外的墻角邊，在泥地上開始焚毀我的書——我的心愛的書！我很怕這火會成燎原之勢……我的手顫抖……我的心跳躍……我的身體發熱……哎！灤東的學生呵！</p>

<h3>將會沉沒的北海孤島</h3>
<p>— 吳華</p>
<p>據地理學者說，從現在斯干的那維亞半島到荷蘭，德國的大海，在太古時代完全是堅固的冰海。大約在距今二萬五千年以前，因為氣候關係，冰海溶解，便成為了現在這樣的北海。在北海上，有一個與海波苦鬥，面積不足二百五十英畝的孤島，那便是不幸的黑爾戈蘭島。</p>
<p>不幸的孤島黑爾戈蘭，依科學家的推測，在它出現時大的有現在五倍這麽大。但因為它產生以後就經常地遭到怒濤的攻打，海波的侵蝕，使它的領土日益縮小下去。就最近百年的情形看來，大約它每十年要减少一英畝的面積。這樣下去，它的存在當然是很可憂慮的了。</p>
<p>不過，海波的侵蝕這個孤島是很慢性的，幷不像帝國主義的侵略弱小民族那樣，很快地將它全部吞滅。就以現在的情形來估計，孤島的壽命至少也還有三四千年。因此，對於現刻住居在島上的兩千島民，整個島的繼續被海波侵蝕，幷不覺得可怕。他們所最擔憂的，是在島的東部海上一個長的一哩的砂嘴的運命。因為這個砂嘴可說是全體島的生命綫；如果它一旦沉沒，那孤島上島民的生活卽會馬上陷於絕境。為什麽這個砂嘴對於他們這樣重要呢？這却是一言難盡的。</p>
<p>原來在砂嘴西北部，在島與砂嘴之間，有一個被島人所稱的白崖。在那裏有品質優良的白堊（白色的土），首先為漢堡商人們所採取！同時島民們也就依靠着做這種工作以為生。但不幸由於暴風雨的襲擊，怒濤的攻打，道個屹立水面二百尺的大白崖被摧毀了，現在只有在退潮時候才可見到那崖頂的形影，成為了一個大的暗礁。這不能不說是大自然對於人類的播弄。</p>
<p>喪失了白崖以後的孤島島民，惟一的求生之道便只有捕捉魚類和海島了。一八〇六年拿破崙攻下柏林，積極圖謀征服歐洲；他為了金　征服英國，會對牠實行經濟封鎖，禁止歐陸諸國與牠通商，不准英國及其殖民地船隻停審歐洲各海港。這樣一來，便逼使英人注意到了黑爾戈蘭孤島，以之為絕好的秘密貿易地方。一時之間，英國商店都爭先到滬裏來建立分店，商人們也常到這裏來經營商業，使這不幸的北海孤島莧得到了「小倫敦」的雅號，成為了一個可觀的大商業都市；而島上居民生活也就因此比較有些改善。但後來這幸運的對英經濟封鎖解除了，秘密貿易當然沒有了必要，而黑爾戈蘭孤島也就成為了英國的領土，因此該島島民又喪失財源，再遭到了悲慘的命運。</p>
<p>說來眞是要感謝老天，在孤島島民重陷於窮苦生活的絕境時，他們中有一位專業家忽然靈機觸動，想出了一個辦法，那便是籌劃在那砂嘴上開設海水浴塲，以招引由北歐諸國到此來避暑的客人。這個籌劃經過長時期的努力，克服了許多困難，才算獲得了成功。現在，每年夏季三四個月間，由德國，由北歐諸國來這兒避署沐浴的人有好幾千。這些客人在三四月內的消費便是孤島島民的生活資源。</p>
<p>但是，現在這個砂嘴在長潮時只現出水面數尺；萬一不幸，一朝遇到了非常的暴風雨的襲擊，巨濤駭浪的攻打，那它便有遭到全滅的危險。這亦孤鳥的島民簡直是一件不敢想像的事。</p>
<p>現在，黑爾戈蘭島是屬於德國的。說起德人獲得該島的經過和他們在這裏所做的事來，也不很簡單。上面已經說過，這個孤島本來是為英國所佔有的，它之由英國讓渡給德入，還是一八九〇年間的事。為了取得這個將會沉沒的北海孤島，德國竟將它在東菲的一些殖民地奉送給了英人。這不消說是很耐人零味的。德國之不惜以重大代價來取得這個孤島，當然有它的極大用意。因為在德國看來，這雖然是一倘小小的孤島，却也有很大的軍事價値。它得到這個孤島後，卽馬上在這裏動工建築一個很大的軍港，才方面在高地的要銜設立砲台，安置大砲，另一方面又在軍港與各砲台之間構築隧迫，貯藏糧食，使其成　德國一個大的海軍根據地。對於風雨和浪濤的進攻，德國人也曾努力從事於人工的防禦，特別在波濤進攻最猛烈的西豳，興築大的工程，結果島的縮小情形便大為减退了。但由於島本身幷非由堅固的岩層所構成，所以在風雨波濤的攻打下，　是難於抵禦的。</p>
<p>一九一四年世界大戰爆發後，德國立刻强迫島民在數小時之內携帶必要物品，乘避難船至漢堡，而他們遺留下來的財產當然也就為德軍無條件地佔有了。在四年四月的大戰中，島民們為德國當砲灰，不知死了好多；僅有一部分倖存者，戰後仍回到這不幸的孤島來，依靠砂嘴的浴塲，過他們那不幸的生活。</p>
<p>戰後，由於凡爾賽條約的規定，島上的一切軍事設備均被拆除了。說來眞有點駭人，為了拆除砲台和軍港設備，差不多絆過了三年的時間，每天都爆炸着轟轟隆降的響聲，長期地震動看這北海的孤島和島上不幸的人羣。</p>
<p>現在，歐洲風雲較一九一四年還要緊急，希特勒已撕碎了凡爾賽條約，其野心。的眼光隨時都可轉向北歐來，因之這北海的孤島也隨時都有再行武裝的可能了。</p>
<p>職業婦女的自白</p>
<h3>紗廠女工</h3>
<p>— 陳英女士談</p>
<p>每天早上，天剛剛才像似在亮吧？可是在我們這般聽慣了的人，老早已聽見廠裏烟囱中發出來嗡嗡的頭回聲了，這時，享福的人們怕誰都還在睡夢中呢！而我們却要趕緊爬下床來，趕快梳洗。往往不等你梳洗得從容，那嗡嗡嗡的第二個回聲，又似乎在詛咒我們，呌我們趕快走吧！走吧！我們便不得不趕快離了家，急忽忽飛快地往廠裏跑。因為下面接着的就是第三個回聲，廠裏的鐵門就緊跟着會關上了。不過，廠的黑漆大門，我好像從來沒有看見它關着，這便是表明我從來沒有遲到過一回。雖然有好幾回也很危險，那便是當我好像要生病似的頭痛如割，全身疲乏地不想起身時候，但想起了要開消要吃飯，便立刻如同有一盆冷水澆在自己頭上，使我一點也不為難地爬起來走出門去了！</p>
<p>照一般的情形，我們每月每人是可以賺到十三四塊錢的。不過，這都是指做了一二年的熟手說，她們都是做活工，每天能做多少生活就照規定工價計算多少工資。如果是生手，那便不同了。初聽見，要使想做女工的人皺眉的。像我們這××紗廠的規例，凡是一個新人進來，第一個月是完全沒有錢可拿的，要等到學會了才有二角五分錢一天；第一次論月拿工錢又只能拿二十天到手。十天算是存工，這存工的錢要等到你不做工或者死亡時，才能退還你或者給你應得這欵的家裏人。</p>
<p>講到這點收入，自然是不够開消的。不過，如果有父母姊妹兄弟們都能在廠裏做工，那嗎，把大家的收入合起來大家用，便相當寬裕了。如果是一個單身人，每個月住房子吃飯就得花上十塊左右，有時還要寄點錢給鄉下住的父母，或是小小應酬，所以她們的錢總是感覺不够的。幸而她們的生活倒也相當謹愼節儉。像租房子，多半是兩個人或者三個人共租一間灶披，稍好一點的是後樓，但租擱樓的是大多數；吃飯也是大家合夥燒。因為只有這樣，大家才可以勻出點時間來做點零碎家事，比如今天她燒飯，我就可以乘空洗洗衣服，明天我燒飯，她又可以做她要做的零碎事。你知道我們是很忙的，每天從早上五點三刻進廠，一直要做到下午六點六得回家，中間只有吃飯時侯可得到一個鐘點的休息。中飯是自己帶進飯籃子去，我們多半是煮好菜飯，外帶一點蘿葡乾，西瓜皮等鹹菜過過口。</p>
<p>紗廠裏密密層層地排滿了比人高的紡織機，花絮不斷地從那狗牙齒似的「錠子」裏吐出來，雪片柳絮似的飄在四面，屋子裏面到處飛滿，使人一個不當心便嗆得要死。但久而久之，也就弄慣了。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但在女工羣中我們廠裏的一班人總算是最幸福的了。我們的廠，範圍倒也不小。每天要織出十磅布一千四百疋，另出麵粉袋四萬只。全廠男女工友的人數，據我所知道的，單是寄宿在廠裏的便有二千一百人。廠裏職工宿舍共分四區。第一區女工養成工（生手）宿舍，有臥室五十間，每間住十人或十餘人，現共住有五百二十四人。第二區單身女工（熟手宿舍共三十幢，每幢兩層，現住六百十一人，也是每十個或十幾個人住一間。第三區是特別給工友有家屬的居住，共計三十三幢，現住有五百九十四人。第四區是單身男工宿舍，有臥室三十三間，現住有四百零一人。一區四區是三層樓一長排洋式房屋，完全水泥鋼骨建築。冷熱自來水，鐵床，食堂，衛生厠所，浴室，洗面室，閱報室，課室等等設備很完全。又有規定：凡一二三區裏住的女工，每天要到一區裏沐浴一次：住三四區的男工，每天要到四區裏去沐浴一次。至於二三區的設備，便僅如同在廠外普通的弄堂房子一樣，不過取價極廉，開消可比在外面節省。廠裏又在靠近各區中心處設了一個消費合作社，出售一切日常必需品，本廠的紗線布疋以及柴，米，油，鹽，醬，醋，茶，糖等物莫不一應俱全。在公共衛生方面，又設得有五樓五底的職工醫院一所，聘有一位醫務主任和一位產科女主任，此外又有女看護兩位，中醫一位，凡本廠職工均可免費診治。另外，又有一個甚麽俱樂部，那里有閱報處，圖書館，打彈子處，工友們在職員指導下又組織得有籃球隊，，網球隊，足球隊，乒乓球隊，大戲班，話劇班，音樂班，國術班等，凡職工均可在規定的時間裏去自由活動。並且，我們還要受强迫敎育哩！我們廠裏據說有好幾個補習學校：分為男工晨校及夜校，女工晨校及夜校，所有廠裏的職員都要担任本校義務敎員。</p>
<p>不過，在有些地方，設備似還欠完善，以致時常發生工友被機器皮帶弄得斷肢殘足的事。在楊樹浦，你常可聽見「嗚嗚嗚」的很悽慘的聲音。那就表示着，在我們這羣勞働者當中，又有一個遭不幸了！</p>

<p>寓言</p>
<h3>淡水</h3>
<p>— 陳汝惠</p>
<p>亞德號郵船載着滿艙的旅客駛出了赫陀羅海峽，銳角度的船尖刺破了海面，衝開洶湧的大浪，噴着白色的水沫；高大的烟囱銜着一大條濃黑的長烟，遼遠地拖曳在無際的水面上。這一隻怪物一樣的大船，在海水的起伏中，陽光的照耀中，平穩地向前進行。船主高興地吸着雪茄烟，輕快地來回在艙板上。</p>
<p>郵船日夜進行着，機房裏的機件軋軋地不息的在響着，烟囱仍大口地噴出黑烟，什麽都美好，什麽都充滿了和平的氣象，但是，船主的眉却鎖緊了；他不再幽閒地踱步，也不再高興地吸烟，他走進了廚房，又重復走出去；這種怪僻的行動引起旅客們的注目，於是他們請求船主宣佈這疑團，並且環繞着他，堅决要求他說明不安的原因，因為他們深信船主的憂愁自然不是他個人的私事。</p>
<p>「諸位！」船主吞吞吐吐地說，手指間夾着熄了火的烟捲，他是不再留心到這個了。「諸位先生！我們的亞德號並沒有壞掉任何部份，也不曾遇到什麽危險，牠可以平安地把我們送到目的地。只是缺少了我們的飲料，據廚房裏報告，船上貯積的淡水只够兩天的用途，兩天後我們不能再有淡水了，這對於諸位的健康有非常大的影饗；我們還有八晝夜的行程，我們將要斷絕一百四十四小時的淡水！」</p>
<p>於是艙板上雜沓的羣衆起了很大的騷動，毫無秩序的議論沸騰着，有的、跑進廚房間探視貯水器，有的在大發脾氣地亂嚷着，也有把這消息報告所有相識或不相識的人。</p>
<p>「這怎麽辦呢？威廉先生！」一個旅客暴躁地向船主質問。</p>
<p>「威廉先生！這是你的責任呀！」另外一個又喊了起來。</p>
<p>「是，是。」船主可憐地點着頭，把手挿在褲袋裏，面上掛着無可奈何的玲靜，木偶般的依着欄杵。</p>
<p>「唉，我們眞倒霉，搭上這隻倒霉郵船。」紳士太太撅着嘴咕嚕！</p>
<p>「沒有淡水怎麽行？海水是不好喝的，我們不習慣做條鹹水魚的。」小姐們尖聲尖氣地說，搖着頭滿臉的不高興。</p>
<p>「沒有淡水怎麼行？」大家齊聲附和着。</p>
<p>船主又開口了：「讓我拍個電報給鄰船吧，或者他們能帮一些忙，送多少淡水給我們也未可知。」電報拍了，大家暫時沉默着等待回音。不多一刻，回電來了，沒有答應他們的要求，却給了一個有效的指示。鄰船的電文說：「你們的船，正行駛在淡水之中，你們需要淡水，請就近儘量的滿載！」</p>
<p>船員便打起一桶水來嚐一口，果然是淡水。於是全船驚異着這種奇遇，他們為絕處逢生而慶幸，並且祈禱着感謝上帝，認為上帝的賜與是大量的，憐恤人們是無所不至的。</p>
<p>船主含着一口淡水，展開他的笑渦，他不想威謝上帝的盛情厚意，他想着浸在淡水裏的船也會向人家求助淡水，便深深地感嘆到「人們在幸福中，却不會知道自己是幸福的！」</p>
<p>旅客們滿意了，比沒有發現淡水將之前更形快樂。</p>

<h3>理論與實踐</h3>
<p>— 輔之</p>
<p>記得明朝時江南有一個人，名呌吳士，他本是一個白面書生，對於武藝兵法完全外行。他僅僅從字面上讀了一些太公「陰符之謀」和孫吳的兵法，便在自己的鄉里自吹自擂起來，說他如何如何了解孫吳兵法之奧妙，如何能善用兵，幷且招集許多同輩到家裏來，照着書本所說，去做「擊刺坐作」之法。他自以為「舉世莫及」了，但是到了明末，元人入侵，國家聞他的大名，就請他去當一名將官，他還是「照本宜科」，用他在屋子裏面所揣摩出來的「擊刺坐作之法」去對付敵人，一到戰塲上，却原來不是那會事，他所研究的一點沒有用處，結果他為元兵所執。</p>
<p>從這一個故事中我們知道單是坐着高談闊論而不實際去行動，固然要「閉門造車，出門不合」，而且卽使你行動，如果你的行動是關在屋子裏面的，是與實際的社會的活動隔離了的，那不管你如何努力地行動，也仍是「閉門造車，出門不合」。</p>
<p>一提起明代的王陽明，恐怕是人人都知道的吧。他是一位理學大師，專講「明心見性」，「格物致知」之學。在學理上他總算是有成就的了。但是他有一天要把他的「格物致知」的工夫去「格。庭前的竹子，一直「格」了三天，不單對於那竹子一無了解，而且腦筋也給他「格」量了，身體也給他「格」起病來了，這才放下用他的「格物致知」之學去格實物的工作，還是去「格物慾，致良知」。可喜的是他吃過了這個苦頭以後，他竟提出了「知行合一」之學來。這學說便是說知—卽理論—和行—卽實踐—是不可分的。他又說「知卽是行，行卽是知」。</p>
<p>上面是就那單談不行，卽是說只講理論不作實踐的一方面說。至於那光是實踐而不研究理論的又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>「老農」和「老圃」，對於農業和園藝，他們不能不算是每天都在實踐了，但是為甚麽他們不能使農業和園藝改良進步呢？為甚麽幾千年來這兩者還是停留在原始的經營方法上呢？有些愛國主義者，他們對於民族和國家不能不說楚忠實到極點，他們可以投河自殺，可以組織血魂除奸團，捐軀捨命來愛國，這不能不說是勇敢地實踐，行動了，但是這樣的狹隘的愛國主義對於民族國家是否眞地有益呢？</p>
<p>這樣看來，「坐而言」不「起而行」，固然不對，但光是實踐而不去研究理論，也是行不通的，尤其在現在這樣的社會。</p>
<p>原來人類的生活就是一個實踐行動的過程，中國的老子和德國的歌德都說「太初有行」，可見行動在先，實踐在先。但是人類社會一進了步，而人類的實踐，人類的社會的活動，便搆成了許多的經騐。後來的行動便是前面的經騐之繼續。如果後面的行動不根據前面的經騐，那我們現在豈不是還要去「鑽木取火」，「茹毛飲血」嗎？後來的行動是把以前行動的結果所得出的經騐拏來運用，運用牠來指導現在的行動，帮助現在的實踐。旣然這樣，那我們在未行動之先，就應該研究以前的行動的結果。把那些經騐組織起來就成了理論。理論原先是從實踐中產生出來的，到了後來又能指導和帮助實踐。再進一步，將來的實踐又須得過去和現在的實踐結果的理論去指導，因之過去和現在的實踐也就提煉成了一種為未來實踐的理論。總之，這卽是理論離不了實踐，而實踐也離不了理論。</p>
<p>有些人以為理論和實踐可以分開，獨立存在，而且可以分工地去作牠。這是不對的。天地間是决沒有離開了實踐而尙能絕對單獨發展的理論。一切科學理論，如果不用之於工科實踐，是决不會進步的。一切社會理論，如於當前社會無關，一點也不能為社會之改良或改造盡力，那麽牠將失去其為社會理論之資格。所以理論之要能發展，不特要牠是具體的理論，是由實踐中產生出的理論，是合於實際的理論，而且牠在成為理論這一個時期，這一個階段，也是刻刻不離地融合於，滲透於實踐過程中的。實踐刻刻不離地伴着理論，把理論作為指南針，而沿着這方面進行，同時在實踐過程中，理論也刻刻被證實，被修正，被豐富。工科實踐進步而科學也進步了，科學進步而工科實踐也進步了。在社會運動過稈中，產生了社會政策，社會學說，同時這學說又指導了社會之改良和社會之改造。「離開了實踐的理論是空虛的，離開了理論的實踐是盲目的　」理論和實踐是統一於這矛盾騷展的　　之中的。有些人只抓着「沒有…　理論就沒有……行動」這一句有名的話，便以爲理論可以單獨硏究，獨立發展，這是不對的。至於因了這句話，就把理論高　起來，以潤理論是站在司令台上，發號司令，指揮着實踐，那更是不對的。如果照這樣說，那我們坐在屋子裏面單研究孫吳的兵書，就可以到戰塲去衝鋒陷陣了，這豈不同那好大言的吳士一樣滑稽可笑嗎？如果理論是高高地站在司令台上指揮實踐，那同時那種理論也就是不落實際，與實際不合的理論了，還能指導實踐不成？</p>
<p>實際說來，實踐才是主要的，基礎的。盲目的實踐固不對，但是理論總是生於實踐，為了宜踐。而且理論之正確與吾，又必就正於實踐。不正確的理論，在社會的實踐過程中被推翻了，被修改了，實踐又創造出合乎自己的理論來。而且理論之是否正確，决不是單憑各種理論之對比，而是要看那種理論合於實際。所以結底說來，理論和實踐同為重要，但主導的仍為實踐。</p>
<p>現在的社會已經到了最富於矛盾性的階段了，人們在其中也决不是盲目地可以生存的了—不管國家和個人。我們應該取得理論的遺產來從事實踐，尤其應該在實踐中去學習理論，產生理論。</p>
<h3>介紹「怎樣研究哲學」</h3>
<p>（王特夫著，三江書店出版，定價七角）</p>
<p>本書作者曾經作過許多關於哲學和科學的理論著作，這本怎樣研究哲學是他的近著。全書係用新的觀點和方法把如何研究哲學這一問題有系統地，綜合地作了詳明的解釋。在文字上是異常流利而通俗，而在內容上却又幷不流於膚淺。</p>
<p>本書的內容共為九章：第一章，「哲學是甚麼性質的一種科學」，包含哲學所處理的對象，哲學的類型，哲學是怎樣的科學等問題，第二章，「為甚麽應當研究哲學」，包括哲學與生活，哲學與科學等，第三章為「研究哲學之實證的和經騐的方法」，第四章為「怎樣進行分析的研究」，第五章為「怎樣進行綜合的研究」，第六章為「如何作批判的研究」，第七章為「研究的進行步驟」，第八章和第九章是論哲學的綱要，為讀者指示一個哲學的具體姿態來。</p>
<p>在這一本小小的著作之中，不僅為我們提供了一個哲學研究法和一個哲學大綱，而且其中還表露出了許多新的意見。對於現在哲學界正爭論得最激烈的「哲學之存廢」的問題，「哲學和科學之關係」的問題，「哲學內部之分部」的問題，都特別發揮了正確的議論。這是一般研究哲學的人尤應注意之點。</p>

<h3>客家風俗談</h3>
<p>— 辛楚</p>
<p>我因事來到南方，在福建和廣東底客族中，過了將近一年的光陰。這期間我常常和客籍人接觸，我以為客籍人和中國其他各民族有些不同的地方，道在客籍人自身和久住在客族中的外人，也許不很知道，因為他們都已習以為常了。</p>
<p>客籍人是從中原遷來的，這在各方面都已得了專家底　明；例如考據客族之從中原遷來，有的人說遷了三次，有的人又說祇有兩次，然不管兩次三次，都公認客族是從中原遷徙米的。在言語學上，楊恭恒曾證明客語多中州古音；近儒意太炎所作嶺外二州語」，亦證明客語底本質實與中原無異。再就客族底譜系來說，你隨便問那個客籍人，他都會吿訴你：他底祖宗是從那一省遷來的；如你問一個稍受過敎育的客籍人，他並且會吿訴你：他們在什麽時代從什麽地方為什麽遷到這裏來。雖然他們遷來的時代，　　的一批是在十一二世紀（宋朝），却至今還保存警客籍人的名稱，若遇客籍</p>

<h3>False Bandit Army Changes Plans; Plans to Invade Northern Sui from Bailing Temple; Sui Province Authorities Increase Defenses in that Area; Cutting Off Coal Routes and Blocking Fuel for All Bandit Units; Rumor Says that Yesterday Morning, Fu Zuoyi Convened a Meeting of His Troops</h3>
<p>(Guihua) This morning on the 7th, it is rumored that Fu Zuoyi convened a meeting of his troops. Tian Shumei, the Security Commander of Western Sui, and Zhao Zhongrong, the County Chief of Baotou, reported to Fu Zuoyi on the military and political situation in Western Sui on the 7th. Dong Qiwu, a military officer from Fu's troops stationed in Pingdiquan, arrived in Sui from Fengzhen on the 7th to report to Fu on the defense of Eastern Sui. Da Miling Sulong, the commander of the bandit suppression in the Four Banners of Eastern Sui, recently returned to the banners from Pingdiquan. On the 7th, he sent Hu Fengshan to report to Fu on the defense of the Four Banners. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Wang Ying's troops had completely arrived at Bailing Temple before the 16th. The defense area of Shangdu, which was left behind, was taken over by Wu Guting's troops. Li Shouxin's troops are currently marching towards Shangdu and are expected to arrive within two or three days. Bao Dele'e's troops will take over Zhangbei. After the troops have completed their transfer, they will take a pincer offensive against Sui. Bandit puppet Mongolian troops are eyeing Northern Sui, while Rehe bandit troops and others are invading Eastern and Western Sui separately. The puppet troops in Guyuan are demanding 200,000 jin of flour, 400 laborers, and 200 carts from the people for the army's westward march. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet troops of Chabei, Li Shouxin and Wang Ying's units, concentrated in Shangdu and Zhangbei last month, respectively. Only a small number of mechanized equipment transported from a certain direction in Rehe has arrived, with the majority still in Rehe. Due to the lack of equipment and transportation difficulties, the puppet troops are still concentrating separately. Currently, a total of seven to eight thousand puppet troops are gathered in Zhangbei and Shangdu. Li Shouxin's troops are actively concentrating in the Zhangbei area. Due to Sui's ban on the transportation of coal and grain to the Mongolian territory, the scattered bandits in Li's unit are gradually seeking food in Northern Sui. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangyuan dispatch, the puppet bandit army of Chabei, Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Jin You San, and the Mongolian bandit Bao Yueqing and other units, originally planned to invade Taolin, Xinghe and other places, but due to the solid defenses of Sui Province, they have repeatedly suffered heavy blows, and then retreated to Nandu to await opportunities. The bandit leaders have been meeting for days, and it is said that they plan to abandon the original plan and invade northern Sui from the Bailing Temple area. In addition to Bao's troops already arriving at the temple, other bandit units are also moving towards the temple. The Sui authorities have increased defenses in that area and decided to cut off the coal route to Mongolia and block the fuel for the bandit units. The pseudo-bandit army is now in a state of panic. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Guihua said that the pseudo-bandit troops of Chabei, Li Shouxin and Wang Ying's units, have recently concentrated in Shangdu, planning to divide into two routes to invade Yuhe and Taolin, and take Zhuozishan, Fengzhen, and Datong, with Shangdu as the base for the eastern route. The Northwest Communist bandits recently briefly invaded the border between Sui West and Yi Meng. The pseudo-bandit army plans to take advantage of Sui Province's inability to take care of both east and west, and launch a large-scale invasion, with Li Shouxin, Wang Jingxiu and other units using Bailing Temple as a base to threaten Northern Sui. There are car roads from Bailing Temple to Shangdu Jiabusi, which is convenient for transportation. After the reorganization of the Mongolian Political Council, the Chabei-Mongolian Council has not yet moved. Bailing Temple in Chabei has become a place for open communication with a certain party. Currently, the deployment of troops in Sui Province has been completed. The small contact in Eastern Sui was an accidental encounter between outposts of both sides. Although the movement of the pseudo-bandit army is tense, a large-scale invasion is still waiting for the Rehe pseudo-army Wang Jingxiu's troops, which are still successively heading west, with the majority concentrated in the Shangdu Baochang area. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It seems that the invasion of Suiyuan by the Mongolian miscellaneous troops of Chahar and the "Manchukuo" army is still waiting for some time. Today, the responsible parties here said that the rumor that they have arrived in Taolin is not credible. According to the most reliable news, the Suiyuan border has not yet been invaded. Furthermore, according to reliable news from the Chinese side, approximately one thousand Mongolian reinforcements have arrived at Bailing Temple. Therefore, it is feared that the "Man" Mongolian army may attack not from the east but from the north. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Wang, the vice chairman of the Sui-Mongolian Political Council, is concerned about the situation in Eastern Sui. On the 4th, he telegraphed Pan Tu to inquire about the truth. Yesterday, he learned that he had received a reply telegram on the 6th, saying, "Your telegram has been respectfully received. The situation in Eastern Sui is reported to be tense. Vice Chairman Pan came to Sui on the 4th to report that a pseudo-army of a thousand people arrived at Prince De's residence and stationed in Bailing Temple through the Siziwang Banner, bringing various military weapons," etc. As for the Yi Meng area, no news has been received, and it is thought to be very peaceful. Wu Jishi bows.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou dispatch, on October 17th, two agents from a certain country's intelligence agency traveled by car from Sui to Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia. After getting off the car, they immediately entered Gan's residence. As of now, they have not left the banner. In addition, a certain country's plane flies over the area from time to time for inspection. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming came to Beiping to review the troops stationed in Qinghe and visited Song to report on the recent situation of the defense of Chahar Province. After the matter was completed, he returned to Zhang tonight. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

Regarding the military's opinions on reforming the Diet, reforming administrative institutions, and the issue of diplomacy towards China, President Adachi gave a speech first, followed by a declaration of the party's attitude. At that time, President Adachi expressed his personal beliefs regarding diplomacy towards China, saying that since the government has adopted a secretive approach, the truth has been concealed in Japan, while foreign countries are openly discussing it. In particular, Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the British House of Commons exposed the entire course of Sino-Japanese negotiations. This is a serious issue that Japan cannot remain silent on. President Adachi will soon visit Prime Minister Hirota's official residence to inquire about his true intentions. (7th Domei Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Paid a Visit to the Governor of Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun's Speech on Sino-British Friendship; Returns to Province in Evening; Will Fly to Guilin to Meet Li and Bai Within Days</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke paid a visit to the Governor of Hong Kong at 11:00 AM on the 7th. At 1:00 PM, he attended a welcome meeting for Hong Kong businessmen at the Grand Hotel. Senior officials of Hong Kong, such as the Colonial Secretary, were also invited. Sun said in his speech that Sino-British friendship is becoming increasingly close, unprecedented since the founding of the Republic and since the beginning of Sino-British trade. The past estrangement between the province and Hong Kong has been swept away, which is very gratifying. The peaceful unification of our country and the nation's purchase of airplanes to wish Chiang longevity prove that the people's hearts have not died. Our people are now working hard to revive the country. In the past, we believed that China was bullied by foreign powers and that only a war could resist the insults. However, in my humble opinion, if our nation can be united, I dare say that we can resist even without resistance. Since our country has an immortal spirit, I predict that the Sino-Japanese issue can be resolved peacefully. Sun returned to the province by ship in the evening. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fujian Under X-Ray Examination (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ya</p>
<p>Apart from the part of the external symptoms of Fujian, as described in the previous article, the vile policy of a certain party to invade Fujian also includes the use of a seductive facade to vigorously spread the toxic seeds of opium (including narcotics), gambling, and prostitution. In addition, there is also the "small pawnshop" with a ferocious tiger's head signboard, which extracts the last drop of blood from our poor people. The small pawnshop charges high interest rates, taking a flat 20% of the value, which is more than ten times the standard 2% higher than the statutory interest rate in our country. However, the pawn period is also very short, mostly only two months. That is, if an item is pawned for one yuan, it will cost four jiao in interest to redeem it after two months, and it will be forfeited if overdue. With high interest rates and short terms, most ordinary people often cannot redeem their items. Although they know that "entering a small pawnshop is like entering the mouth of a tiger," they finally have to bite the bullet and face the man-eating tiger's mouth due to various economic pressures inside and out!</p>
<p>The tiger-like small pawnshops devour the clothing of the common people. Following the tail of these tigers are the second-hand clothing stores and used goods stalls that suck up the remaining flavors. Needless to say, they are all jackals of the same lair, colluding with each other. Moreover, the mission of these small pawnshops, clothing stores, and used goods stalls is not only to exploit our ordinary people, but also to provide a hiding place for thieves to dispose of stolen goods. In the past, when a native committed a crime, the police could arrest them first and then hand them over, but since the September 18th Incident, they must first notify a certain party's consulate and police station before they can be accompanied to make the arrest. However, if the place to be arrested is a native merchant, our police and constables can only wait respectfully outside the door. With this situation, how can one not worry that good wine will turn into sour vinegar? Of course, sometimes a few are caught, just as a certain party said, "in order to take into account the dignity of the empire, which is not greatly hindered," they even send them back to Taiwan, but soon they return to make a comeback and meet with hatred.</p>
<p>For those who have legal tender, they invite you to gamble, prostitute; for those who only have clothing, they invite you to enter a small pawnshop; for the extremely poor who have nothing to pawn, it seems that they should be spared and left a way out. However, in reality, it is not that simple. They also hold up the banner of relieving poverty and provide "daily interest" loans in order to stimulate effects that are beneficial to them. The so-called "daily interest" means that interest is charged on a daily basis. If it is not repaid on time, a fine will be added. For example, if you borrow ten yuan, 1.5 yuan in interest is deducted first, so you actually receive 8.5 yuan, but the account is still calculated at 10 yuan. Starting the next day, 0.25 yuan is repaid daily until it is cleared in 40 days. If 1 yuan is not repaid in four days, then ten times the penalty of ten yuan is imposed, added to the principal, and new interest is calculated according to the same method. From then on, the more you repay, the more chances you have to be penalized. The mother and son multiply each other, and after three to five months, even if you are a wealthy benevolent family with tens of thousands of dollars, you will not be able to settle this muddled account for you. At that time, it is impossible to delay payment and impossible to escape. The lender can abduct you, imprison you, and beat you until you have no choice but to commit suicide or become a thief or a traitor. The harm to the local people is the enemy's benefit, and the merits and rewards are no less than those of Japanese ronin.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also "renting out foreign signs," which is a great business idea to make profits from both "people" and "wealth." Although the situation in Nantai in Fuzhou and Gulangyu in Xiamen is somewhat similar to that of concessions, in reality, there have never been any legitimate treaties of concession signed with the international community. Therefore, Fujian is still outwardly an intact territory. However, the reality is very different. Any foreign company operated by a certain country, or a shop opened by a native, can rely on the legal sale of "extraterritorial rights" not to pay taxes to the local government. This is even more comfortable than in their home country. It would be fine if they did not pay taxes (for the sake of argument), but they also "rent out foreign signs" to Chinese merchants, charging a "foreign sign fee" of several yuan to tens of yuan per month, depending on the size of the business, which is slightly lower than the amount of taxes they should pay. Greedy merchants, seduced by this, do not hesitate to move their nationality without physically moving. Once the rented foreign sign is hung up, it will indeed have an unexpected effect, causing the collectors of property tax, unified tax, business tax, stamp tax (and soon, the income tax collected at the checkpoint) to suddenly stop. This is truly infuriating! What if "foreign signs" become talismans like "Jiang Taigong is here," and every family puts one up? What will happen then?</p>
<p>Some Japanese natives in Xiamen, in addition to stealing electricity for their own use without paying electricity bills, can also sell electricity through the line to merchants who hang foreign signs. The electricity company cannot bear the losses, so it hires a native of a certain country at a high price to be an inspector. Although they can knock on the doors of native residents, after all, they are all people on the same road, and the effectiveness can be understood without being spoken. Moreover, with a foreign sign, so-called "anything is possible," not only can it be used as a shield to resist taxes and steal electricity, but it can also become a den of opium, gambling, prostitution, and theft, transferring the evil money of fellow countrymen. The three "many" that the people of Xiamen say, "many opium dens than rice stores, many brothels than houses, many gambling dens than stalls," is because of this chain-like effect of "opening a foreign company and running several businesses at the same time." For example, a certain hotel in Fuzhou that hangs a foreign sign, in addition to combining opium, gambling, prostitution, and theft, even dares to sell munitions. The XX Hotel, which has just been renamed a private shop in Xiamen, also has a secret room underground, storing a large number of strange objects, all of which are open secrets, and overflowing with a strong gunpowder smell.</p>
<p>Other things such as a certain party establishing newspapers, schools, hospitals, and temples in Fuzhou, etc., for cultural aggression, are even more innovative and capable of luring and anesthetizing people to the extreme. In particular, the hospitals opened by natives are very common in coastal counties. Because of their principle of "the old man's intention is not in the wine," there is also a saying locally that "if you want to know about local affairs, it is best to ask a native doctor." As for the absurdity of the arguments in the Chinese newspapers they run, the distortion of the facts recorded, and the inappropriateness of the textbooks used by Chinese children in school, when one first arrives in the area and reads them occasionally, one is filled with a tone of "imperial majesty and dignity," and one can sometimes be unwittingly bewitched. Although it is only a temporary deception, it is enough to "see how deep the poison is." If we say that the ordinary ignorant people who live here day and night and are influenced by what they see and hear will not be anesthetized and recognize the thief as their father, isn't that deceiving people? When Chiang Ting-wen was about to go to northern Fujian last month, he gave a speech in Xiamen saying that a "special education" should be actively promoted in coastal counties. The content of this education is self-evident.</p>
<p>In short, although the many wounds of Fujian's external infection are too numerous to list, seeing the many vivid examples mentioned above is enough to make one shudder. The intentions of a certain party are also obvious. People of the country with blood still flowing, I wonder what you think: Do you want to let it fester and spread throughout your body, or is it time to use white blood cells? (To be continued).</p>

<h3>General Situation of Western Sichuan After the Calamity</h3>
<p>Western Sichuan is located in a remote frontier, with inconvenient transportation and backward culture. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the government has strived for development, but due to the country's many troubles, it has not been able to implement all measures. In recent years, the Sino-Tibetan negotiations have not been resolved satisfactorily, resulting in the occupation of three or four tenths of the entire Western Sichuan by the Tibetan army. Currently, the area under the jurisdiction of the Western Sichuan Provincial Government is only eighteen counties east of the Jinsha River, and the Yidun Administrative Committee. Last year, the Red Bandits roamed through Western Sichuan, and the military and political affairs of the Sichuan Province fell into chaos. The people suffered at the hands of the bandits, almost throughout the entire territory. Now, at the time of the Red Bandits' northward flight and the serious Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation, Western Sichuan is the center of national defense, and its relationship to the future of the country is extremely important. The Provincial Construction Committee recently moved from Ya'an to Kangding, and is currently engaged in rectification and phased construction.

Although the number of schools is small, the people's wisdom is more developed than in other counties. However, the location is surrounded by large mountains, and transportation is very inconvenient. There are 2,000 households in the city and suburbs. Due to insufficient production, prices are higher than in the interior.

London diplomatic circles initially received this news, which was then confirmed by British officials. It is feared that the fall of Madrid is imminent after the departure of the Spanish government. However, the fall of Madrid should not be regarded as the imminent end of the civil war. The Spanish government forces are now firmly defending fortresses such as Catalonia, Malaga, Valencia, and Barcelona, ​​as well as Minorca and the Basque provinces. Other isolated areas such as Bilbao, Asturias, and the vicinity of Oviedo are also in the hands of government forces. General Francisco Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has repeatedly declared that he will never allow a divided situation to be established. If separate independent governments are established in Catalonia and the Basque Country, he will find a way to abolish them. Therefore, Franco's future responsibilities are not light. According to general opinion, the result of the fall of Madrid is that Germany, Italy, and Portugal will immediately recognize the Nationalist government. According to news obtained by Reuters, the Spanish government has instructed its ambassador to the United Kingdom today to notify British Foreign Secretary Eden of its intention to withdraw from Madrid and declare that after the Spanish government leaves the capital, local security will be maintained by military administrative agencies. At the same time, after the Spanish government moves to Valencia, it will continue to fight against the Nationalist forces. A Reuters correspondent in Madrid reported at noon that the Spanish government had left Madrid early this morning. According to news from Toledo, the militia stationed in Madrid plans to use explosives to destroy several of the capital's most famous buildings, including the Royal Theatre and the Palace, when they retreat. The monuments will also be destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid Thousands of women and children competed to board cars today to flee to the east coast of Spain to take refuge. At that time, the sound of artillery fire was loud, and government artillery was bombarding rebel troops in the southern suburbs. Aircraft from both sides were fighting over the capital. Three government artillery units fired a volley every ten minutes or so, and the sound was so fierce that the whole city was shaken. Government military authorities declared that government troops are still holding their positions, and the entire city has entered a state of military affairs. Telecommunications are strictly censored, and expatriates from various countries have taken refuge in their embassies. (National Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph recently published a commentary on the Spanish Nationalist forces' siege of Madrid, saying, "Although Madrid may fall within a few days or hours, neither the Spanish government forces nor the Nationalist forces believe that the war will end there. The day General Francisco Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, occupies Madrid will not be the time when all of Spain is under his rule. On the contrary, the situation in Spain will be more difficult to unify than before the civil war. General Franco will only have two options at that time: either to induce the people of the whole country to support him, which seems hopeless, or to suppress them by force."

<h3>The Rebel Commander-in-Chief Plans to Form a New Government, Prepare to Take Over Various Institutions, Germany and Italy Ready to Recognize it Immediately</h3>
<p>Avila - General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, has drafted a detailed plan for a new government and has organized a special committee to prepare for the takeover of post offices, railways, police and public utilities. Trucks are now loaded with food, stationed outside Madrid, ready to relieve food shortages. Franco believes that occupying the capital will not end the war. Therefore, he is now planning how to ensure the safety of the entire city and make the capital a base for future operations. It is said that after the fall of the capital, no one can enter the city without the special permission of the Nationalist Army. Foreign visitors who have been approved must also enter the city on a date determined by the Commander-in-Chief together, otherwise they will be charged as spies. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Germany and Italy will recognize the Spanish Nationalist Government as soon as Madrid falls. Portugal and several South American countries are also expected to follow suit. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Italian Trade Agreement Signed, Italians Very Satisfied, Hope Relations Will Improve</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Anglo-Italian trade agreement was signed last night at the Italian Foreign Ministry by Sir Drummond, the British Ambassador to Italy, and Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister. It will take effect on November 16th. It stipulates the restoration of commercial exchange and payment of funds between the two countries, and the gradual settlement of commercial and other debts. In addition, it specifies that Italy's bad debts to the UK, totaling £2.25 million, should be repaid in British gold in accordance with the original loan contract. There are also considerable provisions for the quotas of British goods imported into Italy. The Italians are very satisfied with this agreement and hope that relations between the two countries will improve as a result.</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, the agreement stipulates that, before the implementation of sanctions, the method of repayment of Italy's commercial debts to Britain will be settled by Britain lending 35% to Italy, which means that Italy will repay the old debts at a discount of 65%. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>European Situation</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Former Prime Minister and leader of the Peasants' Party, Mr. Maliu, responded strongly today to Mussolini's statement in Milan last week regarding a "mutilated Hungary," stating that Hungary still remains within its ethnic borders. How can it be called mutilated? If anyone attacks our borders, we will definitely confront them. We will fight hard and not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves. Former professor Mr. Ivo Jia also mentioned Mussolini's speech and urged the people of the country to unite to resist all attempts to undermine Romania's sacred rights. According to reports, in his speech on Sunday last week, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said that the Danube issue can only be permanently resolved after fair treatment is given to the mutilated Hungary. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to political sources, the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary are likely to decide on two important issues related to the Central European situation at the Vienna meeting: the restoration of the Austrian monarchy and the rearmament of Hungary. According to reports, Dr. Weissner, the leader of the Austrian legitimist monarchist party, recently came here from Vienna, reportedly to discuss the restoration of the Austrian monarchy with the Italian authorities. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini recently expressed sympathy for Hungary's demands for revision of the treaty of peace in his speech in Milan. In this case, Italy will undoubtedly support Hungary's rearmament at the Vienna conference. Foreign Minister Count Ciano is scheduled to leave for Vienna tomorrow evening with several senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the trilateral meeting, and will then travel to the capital of Hungary.

<h3>Locarno Question, British Government Sends Note, Comparing Conflicts Between Countries</h3>
<p>(London) On September 18th, the British government sent notes to the governments of France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, proposing to convene a five-nation Locarno Treaty conference to discuss a new Locarno Treaty. Subsequently, the governments of these four countries, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, replied to the British government one after another, putting forward some different opinions. After collecting the replies from various countries and considering them, the British government prepared a note on Wednesday of this week and sent it to the governments of these four countries, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium. According to political sources, the note sent by the British government this time compares the views of the governments of the five countries, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, and points out the conflicts between them, which are divided into four categories:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the nature of the new Locarno Treaty, Britain and France advocate that the new Locarno Treaty should adopt the same nature as the old Locarno Treaty, but in Western Europe, it can be changed to mutual security guarantees. In other words, the signing country should be guaranteed its security by the remaining signing countries, and on the other hand, it must also guarantee the security of the remaining signing countries. Germany does not accept the principle of mutual guarantees. Belgium also hopes to only become a guaranteed country and not be responsible for guaranteeing the security of other countries. As for Italy, it also raises the issue that Britain and Italy should guarantee each other. This is the first conflict.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the exception of the new Locarno Treaty, that is, when a certain issue invokes the provisions of the new Locarno Treaty, and is inconsistent with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, it should be treated as an exception and the provisions of the treaty should not apply. Germany alone rejects this level. This is the second conflict.</p>
<p>(3) Measures to be taken in the event of a violation of the new Locarno Treaty. Britain, France, and Belgium advocate that if the treaty is violated, it should be submitted to the League of Nations for arbitration, but Germany does not accept this method. The Italian reply did not specify. This is the third conflict.</p>
<p>(4) The scope of the five-nation conference. Britain and France advocate that the five-nation conference should discuss the Eastern European issue together. Germany believes that the Eastern European issue should not be brought up for discussion before the Western European security treaty is signed. This is the fourth conflict.</p>
<p>The above four conflicting issues must be resolved first before it is possible for an agreement to be reached between the five countries. Therefore, in the British government's note, it specifically asked the governments of France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium as to which approach should be taken to resolve these issues, whether they should be resolved through diplomatic channels, or whether a five-nation conference should be convened for discussion as soon as possible. This requires the governments of the four countries to express their opinions again. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Near East Group, Afghanistan Accepts, Joining the Tripartite Agreement</h3>
<p>Tehran - Afghan Minister of War, Mr. Makhun Khan, recently came to Iran to visit and meet with key political figures. Foreign Minister Sami hosted a banquet in his honor. Mr. Makhun Khan delivered a speech at the banquet, stating, "Although Afghanistan and Iran had disputes in the past due to border demarcation issues, they were immediately resolved. The two countries have signed an agreement to resolve the disputes, which is very satisfactory. The Afghan government has also accepted the Iranian government's invitation to Afghanistan to participate in the tripartite agreement between Turkey, Iran, and Iraq." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses, People's Physical Fitness, Equal Emphasis on Sports and Nutrition</h3>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, the Labour Party criticized the poor physical condition of the British people. Health Minister Sir Hood replied, asking the House of Commons to pay attention to the recently published report of the British Medical Association Committee, which stated that about 40% of British people between the ages of 14 and 40 do not fully participate in any sports. Hood also said that before submitting the health plan, the government will consult with people who have extensive experience in health affairs. The lifespan of the British people today is higher than that of their ancestors, so it is their responsibility to make their increased years worth living. If men and women want to live worthwhile lives, they must make their minds and bodies healthy. The government believes that physical education and development must occupy a fixed and special position in the national health system. The advisory committee recently appointed to investigate nutrition matters is actively carrying out its work. At the request of the committee, the Ministry of Health is now working with local authorities to investigate several dietary issues. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>On Eden's Foreign Policy Speech</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary Eden's foreign policy speech in Parliament on the 5th of this month can occupy an important page in Eden's personal political history and in the entire diplomatic history of the British Empire. His beautiful rhetoric, profound implications, broad hints, firm stance are different from the timid Simon, and different from the exaggerated and stubborn Hoare. Today, when the international aggression front is actively threatening the peace front, this young foreign minister can be said to have expressed a clear indication of British diplomacy, which has been hesitant and hesitant. That was a response to Hitler's Nuremberg speech, and also a response to Mussolini's Milan speech. In today's increasingly acute struggle between the two major international fronts, we cannot but believe that such a clear indication is of epoch-making importance.</p>
<p>Upholding the League of Nations and the collective security system, maintaining close friendly relations with France and Belgium, and maintaining friendly relations with Germany, but not implying exclusion or opposition to other countries. Expressing regret for the misunderstanding of Italy, but believing that the UK's transportation routes in the Mediterranean must be guaranteed. In addition, hoping for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese relationship in the Far East. These are the main contents of Eden's speech. These contents show the UK's clear attitude in the current international situation, that is, he leans towards the peace front, and issues a fairly tough warning to the aggression front. Perhaps the only "fly in the ointment" is Eden's view of the situation in the Far East. It is right for the UK to hope for peace in the Far East, but he said that the current Sino-Japanese situation has seen significant easing, which is inevitably using subjective hope to cover up the development of the objective situation. However, in any case, it is a fact that the UK is gradually and firmly shifting from an ambiguous speculative attitude to the peace front. And this fact is gratifying. Therefore, we should base on Eden's speech to briefly discuss the impact of the future diplomatic trends of the UK on the world situation, especially the situation in the two dangerous centers of Europe and the Far East.</p>
<p>Here, we must first mention the role of the UK in the international struggles in Europe and the Far East. Simply put, in the struggle between the two major groups of Germany and France or France and Italy in Europe, the UK stands in a pivotal position. In the Far East, in the opposition between Japan and the United States or Japan and the Soviet Union, the situation is the same. This pivotal leverage played a role in the past stage in the UK's struggle to win and maintain world hegemony. This advantageous position has also sown the seeds of speculation among the conservatives in power, resulting in adverse consequences for international development. For example, Japan's invasion of the Asian continent, the advancement of Germany's military ambitions under Hitler's rule, and the UK's speculative indulgence are all inextricably linked. However, the rise of several aggressive forces in the world has finally hit the vested interests of even those who engage in speculation and opportunism. What is especially important is that these aggressors want to rapidly plunge the whole world into war in order to realize their dream of redistributing the world. What the UK needs in the end is to maintain the status quo and conserve peace. In this way, with the increasing approach of new wars in the world and the very clear division of the two major international fronts, the UK can no longer play his old trick of speculation, and must choose a definite position in the two major fronts of aggression and peace.</p>
<p>Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, the completion of Germany's huge armaments, and the fascist forces' intervention in Spain are the main driving forces that forced the UK to make a decision immediately in the rapidly developing European situation. Now the UK has clearly expressed its friendship with France and believes that the contradictions between Italy and Italy in the Mediterranean are irreconcilable. As for Germany, despite singing the tune of anti-Soviet Union in the Nuremberg Congress, despite the fact that the first document that Ribbentrop took out of his briefcase after arriving in London was a common anti-Soviet Union, the cold response that Eden is now giving is not to oppose other countries. Obviously, the UK now has deeper trust in the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. Since the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet naval agreement, this trust has been increasing. Even Churchill, the most stubborn conservative, now has to say that a peaceful Soviet Union is an indispensable factor in maintaining the balance of power in East Asia.</p>
<p>However, the UK's current view of Europe and the Far East is certainly a bit different. What he is most concerned about should be Europe, which is close at hand. As a result, Foreign Secretary Eden's assessment of the current situation in the Far East inevitably covers up the actual development of the serious situation with subjective demands and hopes for temporary peace. However, sooner or later, the UK will not be able to maintain this view of the development of the situation in the Pacific. He especially needs to understand that it is impossible to promote compromise in the Far East solely based on his subjective hope. The only possible way is to combine several major peaceful forces in the Pacific and jointly resist the aggressors. The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China can all participate in this combination. Any country without aggressive ambitions can participate.</p>
<p>We cannot say that the UK has no such awareness. The recent conclusion of the Anglo-American-French currency agreement, the general diplomatic rapprochement between Britain and the United States, and the UK's recognition of the Soviet Union's naval needs in the Pacific in the Anglo-Soviet naval agreement can all be seen as signs of this trend. Naturally, we should also make greater efforts to promote the realization of this collective peace alliance in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Plans to Convene, International Peace Conference, Decides to Attend in Person, Opening Ceremony of the Americas Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed sources recently stated that President Roosevelt is now preparing to convene an international conference to discuss ways to maintain peace. If this conference can be convened in the United States, he intends to attend in person. In addition, the Americas Peace Conference is scheduled to be held on December 1 in the capital of Argentina, which is particularly valued by the President, because he wants to use the cooperative approach of the Americas countries to satirize Europe, so that they know what to emulate. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Ambassador to Brazil, Mr. Gibson, officially stated after attending a meeting at the Presidential Palace today that the President has decided to personally go to the capital of Argentina to attend the opening ceremony of the Americas Peace Conference. The President is scheduled to stay in the capital of Brazil for one day on November 26. Before Mr. Gibson announced this matter, President Roosevelt told reporters that he very much hoped to attend the Americas Peace Conference, but he could not make any concrete decisions before next week. Secretary of State Hull also told representatives of the Women's Peace Promotion Group today that he hoped that the Americas Peace Conference could set an example for the world to emulate. It is now learned that the President will take the cruiser Indianapolis on November 17th to rush to the capital of Argentina, and will stop briefly in the capital of Brazil on the way. Mr. Gibson is scheduled to return to his post tomorrow to make arrangements for the President. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>New Japanese Parliament Building, Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday, More Than 3,800 Attended, British Ambassador Considered it the First in the World</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The inauguration ceremony of the new Diet Building was held on the morning of the 7th in the large open space in front of the main gate. About 3,800 dignitaries from the military, political, business, education, and construction sectors, as well as all members of the old and new Houses of Parliament, attended. At 11 o'clock, fireworks were set off as a signal, and all members stood up and played the music of Kimigayo. There was a report on the construction work, congratulatory speeches from the speakers of both Houses, and Prime Minister Hirota delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the government. After the ceremony, the group went to the banquet hall in the large open space in the west, raised glasses of champagne, and sang "Long Live the Emperor" and "Long Live the Two Houses" three times. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Craig, visited the new Diet Building on the 6th and said, "It is a truly magnificent building. Thirty-four years ago, when I was a third-class secretary serving at the embassy, there was a foreigners' tennis club in a corner of Nagatacho. I was the secretary of the club and practiced tennis there all the time. Now it has been rebuilt into a magnificent Diet Building, which is indeed the first in the world. It is also surprising to hear that the building materials are all domestic. The British Parliament was built a hundred years ago, and it was the most modern at the time, but it is far from being comparable now." (Domei, 7th) As a result of the consultation of the top leadership with the Army Minister as the center, it was decided to aim at the conclusion of the deliberation of the five-minister conference as the immediate goal, and to pay close attention to the time and result of its conclusion. However, if the result of the five-minister conference is too contrary to the original purpose of the military, the army will once again open its own opinions and, in view of the internal and external situations, will have to move forward towards what it believes. Therefore, regarding the issue of renovating the parliament, depending on the outcome of the five-minister conference, there is a risk of further aggravation. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Finance, Striving to Balance the Budget</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senior government officials indicated today that the government's future fiscal plan intends to find ways to balance the next budget. The government's fiscal policy is as follows: (1) Current expenditures for the next year will be reduced by $140,000,000 from $1,257,000,000; (2) Maintain current taxes; (3) Reduce new borrowing; (4) Continue to collect surplus taxes; (5) The Sino-American silver purchase agreement is about to expire and will not be continued; (6) Continue the domestic silver purchase policy; (7) Continue the world monetary stability policy; (8) Maintain the equalization fund; (9) The President continues to have the power to change the gold price of the dollar; (10) Reduce the gold reserves of the three-nation currency agreement, thereby reducing excess reserves and promoting domestic financial stability. Treasury officials said the government will implement a pay-as-you-go policy and reduce the national debt in two years. However, the known expenditures for this year have already exceeded the Treasury's revenue. Before the government reduces the national debt, the national debt may reach $35,000,000,000. The Treasury expects tax revenue for this year to reach $60,000,000,000. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt met with reporters today and hinted that the government may ask Congress to extend the period for reducing the yuan's price in order to cope with the international monetary situation. The US reduction of currency value will expire on January 30 next year. According to the bill previously passed by Congress, the gold content of the dollar has been reduced to 59.06 percent, and if necessary, it will still be reduced to 50 percent. Expiring at the same time as this dollar devaluation on January 30 next year is a $200 million equalization fund. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that this fund is very beneficial to world currency stability, so he will propose to maintain it. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Note) The new Japanese Diet Building is 720 feet wide and 360 feet deep. The House of Peers is on the right end, with 460 seats. The House of Representatives is on the left end, with 466 seats. The total construction cost is 25 million yuan, and it took 17 years to complete.</p>
<h3>Japanese Party-Government Issues, Army Minister's Statement, Young Turks of the Seiyukai Party, Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the parliamentary system, Army Minister Terauchi issued a statement. The Minseito Party also issued a statement in the form of a speech by Chief Secretary Nagai, stating that the Minseito Party trusts the Army Minister and will not question his responsibility in the future. However, young parliamentarians within the party opposed the Army Minister's statement, advocating questioning the Army Minister's responsibility for commanding the military, and believing that the attitude of the Minseito Party's executives had softened. On the 7th, they elected representatives to meet with President Machida and Secretary-General Sakurauchi to express their strong opinions. (Domei, 7th) Regarding the trend of the army renovating</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Parliament, Army Minister Terauchi clarified three hopes in the cabinet meeting on the 6th, believing that he was able to understand them clearly. On the afternoon of the same day, the military side, with Terauchi as the center, gathered the top leadership to discuss and decided to aim at the deliberation conclusion of the five-minister conference as the immediate goal, and to pay close attention to the time and result of its conclusion. However, if the result of the five-minister conference is too contrary to the original purpose of the military, the army will once again open its own opinions and, in view of the internal and external situations, will have to move forward towards what it believes.

<h3>National Trade is Weak, Japan's Imports Exceeds Exports by Nine Times Compared to Last Year, Britain and the United States also Have Import Surpluses, Germany Alone Has an Export Surplus</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In the first half of this year, Japan's trade balance saw a sharp increase in imports. The second half of the year should have been a period of export surpluses, but exports were unexpectedly weak, making the future very pessimistic. Comparing with the three countries of Britain, the United States, and Germany, only Germany has a better export surplus. Britain and the United States are the same as Japan, suffering from huge import surpluses. According to a survey by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, from January to the end of September this year, the trade volume of the four countries of Britain, the United States, Japan, and Germany showed that Germany's import surplus was more than 300,000 marks in the same period last year, but this year it has turned into a large export surplus of 319 million marks. On the other hand, the United States' export surplus in the same period last year was 66 million, but this year it has turned into an import surplus of 33 million. Britain and Japan are the same as last year, still having import surpluses, and the amount is even greater than last year. Britain's import surplus increased by 32% compared to last year, while Japan's reached 900% (nine times). Since the beginning of this year, due to the dangerous international situation and the volatility of the international exchange market, these negative factors have been actually reflected. The advancement of Germany, which is determined to revive, in the international trade war is truly remarkable. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Keelung Incident, Britain Dissatisfied with Japanese Reply</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Clive visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horinouchi yesterday regarding the case of three British sailors being abused in Keelung, Taiwan, and informed him of the results of the Hong Kong court's investigation of the case. Horinouchi replied that after careful investigation by the Japanese judicial authorities, it was learned that the behavior of the Japanese police was completely consistent with the Taiwan Governor's announcement that the Japanese police had not committed any illegal acts. According to semi-official sources, the British Ambassador was very dissatisfied with this reply and stated that he would submit a detailed report of the Hong Kong court's investigation in a short time to re-negotiate this case.

<p>(New York) The internal strife within the seamen's union here in the past few days has taken a sharp turn. Opposing members of the International Seamen's Union have now declared a general strike by seamen in ports along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico.

<h3>Jehol Under Poisoning: Puppet Authorities Corrupting Public Morality, Bestowing Petty Favors on the Ignorant Masses, Searching and Torturing Intellectuals</h3>
<p>Northern Ping Communication: Recently, Mr. Li, whose ancestral home is Jehol, said that his father, Mr. Someone, once served as a member of the first National Assembly. Since the capital moved south, he has retired to his garden. When Jehol fell, he was unable to escape because he was in his hometown, so he witnessed all the measures taken in Jehol after its occupation. Mr. Li described the situation in great detail, which is abridged below to show a glimpse of the situation in Jehol:</p>
<p>The Someone party in Jehol is vigorously promoting the planting of opium and forcing farmers to plant it. After the harvest, the Someone party collects and buys as much as possible, using heavy trucks to transport it to Tianjin, Ping, and other places, specifically for the manufacture of morphine and other narcotics. The purpose of forcing the people to promote the planting of opium is not only to collect more opium taxes to finance military needs, but also to manufacture narcotics to induce people to consume them, directly weakening our race. This is the viciousness of their poisoning and anesthetizing policy, which is truly frightening.</p>
<p>The Someone party has also established many entertainment venues in Jehol, hiring Chinese traitors through vagrants to rent houses and set up venues. These venues include prostitutes (mostly Someone country prostitutes, occasionally mixed with Korean or Chinese prostitutes), gambling (such as mahjong, pai gow, playing cards, betting, and other gambling tools, all available), narcotics (such as opium, morphine, heroin), and alcoholic beverages (all kinds of alcoholic beverages are available). In addition, there are also musical plays (such as Erhuang, Bangzi Opera, Lihua Dagushu, Su Tan, Huai Diao, and other ditties). In short, everything that can induce and anesthetize the people is available, and the prices are extremely low. It only costs two jiao to enter the venue and buy a venue ticket. After entering the venue, the first thing to do is to draw a lottery. If you win the first prize, you can get something worth dozens of yuan. If you don't win, you can still use the original ticket to buy things, smoke, drink, gamble, watch plays, or watch prostitutes. Therefore, young people, ignorant masses, and frivolous women are all seduced by their deception. Vagrants and Chinese traitors can not only make huge profits by opening these entertainment venues, but also induce the Chinese people to fall, and their plans are also extremely vicious. This is more harmful to the national economy and corrupting of national morality than forcing the people to plant opium.</p>
<p>The puppet authorities are also trying to win the favor of the common people by drastically cutting various agencies. In each county, in addition to the county government, public security bureau, prison, and detention center, all other agencies, such as education and construction, have been reduced or eliminated. Therefore, the local taxes added to the land tax in each county have been greatly reduced, and the burden on the people has been superficially lightened. The general ignorant masses are also deceived by them and quite a few sing praises of their political achievements. Who knows that in fact they are implementing a policy of deceiving the people, so they have stopped or reduced important policies such as education and construction, adopting a passive attitude in everything in order to gradually reduce the people's knowledge, skills, and level, so that they can be easily ruled. Therefore, their surface pretext is to reduce harsh taxes to relieve the people's plight, but in reality, it is a policy of deceiving the people.</p>
<p>The puppet authorities are extremely thorough in handling police affairs and checking household registrations, especially for the intellectual class, such as teachers, students, or former civil servants. They investigate their family circumstances and relationships with relatives and friends in detail. Their intention is to guard against these intellectuals. If they are deemed to have suspicious behavior, they will be arrested and taken to the police station for brutal interrogation, often dying under the cane. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are often disabled or demented due to excessive torture. Therefore, they are more lenient towards ignorant and illiterate people, but extremely cruel and tyrannical towards intellectuals.</p>
<p>Also, their method of preventing popular unrest is to collect firearms. When the Japanese army first arrived in Jehol, they immediately issued an order requiring all people who had firearms and ammunition in their possession to register them within a certain period of time. Not long after registration, they issued another order requiring all firearms to be handed over to the puppet authorities and not allowed to be privately hidden among the people. The puppet authorities would issue a price. Initially, the puppet authorities issued 30 yuan for each gun. Later, they raised the price to 50 yuan. Now, they issue 120 yuan for each gun. The price of guns in the local folk market has always been no more than 50 or 60 yuan. Now, the puppet authorities are buying them, which is more than 100 yuan higher than the normal price. Therefore, the guns in the folk market have been almost completely searched and none remain. Their method of preventing the people can also be said to be meticulous.</p>
<h3>Snake Zone Discovered in Northern Manchuria, Located in Keshan and the Wudalianchi Lake Area, Snake Population More Numerous Than Kyushu and Taiwan Combined</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Japanese in our Northeast send people to conduct investigations at any time and place. According to Japanese propaganda, Kyushu and Taiwan have always been snake-producing areas because they are both tropical regions and their archipelagoes and sandy reefs are extremely suitable for snakes to live in, so they are called natural snake-producing areas. However, it has never been seen that a snake-producing area has been discovered in northern Manchuria, which is extremely cold at minus 30 degrees Celsius, and that its output is more than that of Kyushu and Taiwan. The snake-producing area was discovered by a Japanese zoologist named Ichiro Fukushima. The locations are Keshan in Kedong County and the hot spring area near Wudalianchi Lake in the northeast of Dedu County. The climate in these two places is extremely cold, but snakes can survive there because there are many rocks near the volcanic area. Although the climate is severely cold to minus 30 degrees Celsius, the snakes live in the rocks (because the rocks have a natural lava body, which is extremely warm) and are at their most rampant. They often wrap around people in their sleep, and the clothes they wear are unknowingly inhabited by snakes. Therefore, Keshan is called Snake Mountain. The area near Wudalianchi Lake produces the most snakes. The fifteen kilometers around the lake are all rocky, and many snakes and insects live here. It has now become a snake's nest.</p>
<h3>Obstacles to Anti-Smuggling in North China: Japanese Side Expresses Concerns to the Hebei-Chahar Authorities, Road Transport Inspection Office Moves to Tianjin with No Progress, Cangyan Coastal Defense Inspection Office Secretly Sells Verification Forms</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The General Inspection Office for Road Transport Anti-Smuggling of the Ministry of Finance moved to Tianjin on November 2, located at No. 1 Wu Ma Road in the Italian Concession. Deputy Director Li Tonghua instructed all staff to start working on the 3rd. Deputy Director Li Pengshou also arrived in Tianjin on the 5th to assist with everything. Director General An Si'er was originally scheduled to come to Tianjin on the 8th to preside over the office, but after receiving Li Tonghua's report, he temporarily stayed in Beijing to discuss with the Ministry of Finance. He will only come north after concrete measures are obtained. After the office moved to Tianjin, the internal organization remained the same. The original intention was to set up one or two branch offices in the important areas of the Ping-Sui Railway and the Ping-Jin section of the Bei-Ning Railway to intercept smuggled goods from being transported out of Tianjin. Li Tonghua visited Sun Weidong, Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, and Mei Weiliang, Tianjin Customs Commissioner, several times to exchange opinions on intercepting smuggling and also visited the municipal authorities and the Public Security Bureau to request assistance. In terms of authority, it is also planned to clearly divide responsibilities with the Tianjin Customs. The Customs is responsible for intercepting smuggling on the suburban land and water traffic routes, while the Road Transport Inspection Office specializes in intercepting smuggling on the railway lines. However, while the regulations are clear, difficulties arise in implementation. It is said that certain country smugglers, fearing that the Road Transport Inspection Office's move would lead to anti-smuggling measures, fabricated rumors.</p>
<p>The rumor said that the mission of the Inspection Office was to support the development of British and American commercial power in North China and deliberately suppress the free entry and exit of Japanese merchants. The Japanese military and the Japanese Consulate General were misled by this floating rumor and feared that the Inspection Office would actually have this effect. Once British and American commercial power develops in North China, conflicts will inevitably arise, so they expressed to the Hebei-Chahar authorities that if they seriously assist the Inspection Office in anti-smuggling and unexpected disputes arise as a result, the Chinese side must be responsible. Under the threat, the Hebei-Chahar authorities did not dare to publicly assist the Inspection Office. As a result of Li Tonghua's visits to various authorities in Tianjin, they all believed that if diplomatic channels were not opened, taking strict anti-smuggling measures would cause trouble. Li looked around and found that the only one standing on the same front as the office was the Tianjin Customs. However, the Customs is in the same difficult situation. Although the office has opened, it has not yet performed its duties. Therefore, Li Tonghua returned to Beijing to ask for instructions, hoping to obtain clear instructions from the central government before returning to Tianjin to work.</p>
<p>In the past month, the amount of smuggled goods smuggled out of Tianjin Customs was countless. Although the cards intercepted some, the amount was not much. On November 5, Datong Company, a certain country smuggling merchant at No. 20 Yamaguchi Street, Japanese Concession, transported 184 bolts of cotton cloth (60 pieces per bolt) from Dalian. After the Jidong pseudo-Beidaihe Inspection Office collected taxes and issued tax bills, it was transported to Tianjin. Between the Tianjin East Station and the International Bridge, it was intercepted by Customs officers and immediately detained. The total value of the goods was more than 90,000 yuan. The smuggling merchant immediately reported to the Japanese Consulate. Consul General Horiuchi then sent Deputy Consul Yongai Xunyi to the Customs to negotiate and demand the return of the goods. The Customs refused. In the afternoon, the Japanese Consulate sent another protest letter, pointing out that the goods had already been taxed in Jidong and should be recognized as legitimate imports and cannot be detained or confiscated. The wording was very strong. The Customs has not yet responded. This is likely to be a return to the rampant smuggling situation of the spring. The Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office was ordered to close at the end of June, but the person in charge was still unwilling to give up. Recently, he secretly restored the Cangyan Coastal Defense Inspection Office and set up an office at No. 2 Ma Road in Special Zone 2. Although it has not been approved by the Hebei-Chahar authorities to collect taxes, many of the smuggled goods transported out of Tianjin in recent days have affixed with the office's verification certificate. In fact, the office has probably secretly sold vouchers for the release of smuggled goods. (6th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Repair of Seawalls in Four Counties</h3>
<p>Jianghai Water Conservancy Project Bureau, in view of the fact that the seawalls in Songjiang, Taicang, Baoshan, and Changshu counties have been subject to wind and waves for a long time and urgently need repair, all projects have already started. The necessary piles, wood, and stone materials have also been tendered to merchants and are gradually being transported to the worksite. However, the seawalls are very long, and there are many damaged sections. Each section will be repaired, aiming to complete the work by next spring.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Forced Extortion Leads to Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Hua Adi of Shenzhuang Town, District 5, secretly planted water caltrop seedlings in the river of his neighbor Xu Xuben's house this spring. Xu reasoned with his uncle Hua Changsheng. Changsheng agreed to pay 50 catties of old water caltrop as rent. Later, because Changsheng delayed fulfilling his promise, Xu hired the local ruffians Shen Fushan and Zhang Xiaodi to go to sue him, but to no avail. The other day, Changsheng went to Zhaolou Town on business and was followed by the ruffians, who extorted four yuan. Changsheng agreed to give one yuan. The ruffians declared that they would not do anything without four yuan, otherwise they would drag him to the teahouse for a public hearing. Changsheng was subjected to petty insults, and in anger, he threw himself into the river. The ruffians saw him die but did not help him and instead tried to escape. He was caught by Jin Ming, the accountant of the Huami Factory, and others. While quickly ordering boatmen to recover Changsheng, he had already drowned. Jin and others sent the two ruffians to the town office, which then asked the Hangtou Public Security First Police Station to investigate, ordering the clerk to guard Hua's body and transfer the ruffians to the Xinchang Public Security Third Substation, which transferred them to the county government for interrogation. Hua's body was also transported to the city by boat, where the county sent personnel to inspect it.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Field Industry Bank Opens Warehouse to Collect Rent</h3>
<p>The field industry banks in this county, in order to prepare for opening warehouses, sent a public letter from the representative conference to the county chamber of commerce, which forwarded it to the grain industry association, to investigate the recent market price of unhusked rice in order to calculate the discount. The various industry banks have now decided to open warehouses to collect rent from the 11th of this month. After the grain industry association sent a letter from the county chamber of commerce, it listed the unhusked rice market prices from October 15 to November 2 for 19 days. The field industry association plans to convene a meeting in the next two days to discuss discounts.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Bridge to Begin Construction</h3>
<p>The various projects in Xiangmen, newly opened for the Su-Jia Railway, are progressing actively and being gradually completed. The sleeper frame at the bottom of the Xing Shi Bridge will also be laid soon. However, because the river surface is wide at the Xinhua Bridge outside the city, it is planned to have thirteen holes for the bridge piers. Bridge pier construction cannot be done without the use of machinery, so the Xi Fuji Construction Company, which contracted the project, has contacted them to schedule the delivery of the machinery to Suzhou for use. Preliminary work is scheduled to begin on the 10th of this month and can be completed around the end of February next year.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Local Restoration Commemoration</h3>
<p>The 6th was the local restoration commemoration day in this county. Representatives from all walks of life held a commemoration meeting at the county party headquarters at 9:00 a.m. More than 70 representatives attended, and Yan Huading presided over the meeting and reported on the brief history of the restoration. Then, Wang Yaomin, who participated in the uprising at the time, gave a speech, with many words of encouragement.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Widening the Xi-Yi Highway</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Long-Distance Bus Company believes that the styles of the bus stations on the Yi-Xi, Yi-Li, and Jing-Hang highways are inconsistent and unsightly, so it advocates rebuilding them to make them uniform. It has ordered the engineering department to actively plan, and it will be implemented soon. In addition, the road surface of the Yi-Xi Road is still narrow, and it is dangerous for vehicles to travel back and forth. The engineering department stationed in Yi has sent workers to widen the road section by section, which was completed last week. Most of the bridges in Yixing County are sloped and narrow, and it is also necessary to rebuild them and make them more solid. The survey has been completed, and on the 6th, road maintenance workers were sent to start rebuilding.</p>
<h3>Illegal Soil Dealers Investigated</h3>
<p>There are a total of three licensed soil paste shops in this county: Dachang, Yongxing, and Futai. There are 13 soil paste stores, such as Yitai and Dalong. There are 57 smoking outlets, such as Shenchang. All are doing thriving business and making a lot of profit. However, there are many dark secrets among them. Some soil paste shops use gluten paste as a material and mix it into the soil for sale to smokers. Last month, Futai soil paste shop in Guangfu Inner City Toutou Lane was found to be selling illegal soil by the Public Security Bureau and was sent to the special commissioner's office for review and handling. Also, Yitai soil paste (formerly Yonglong) outside the North Gate Bay Lane, which was set up by Lian Shaoshan (also known as Lian Tang), was also found to be illegally selling illegal soil by the Public Security Bureau. Zang Qifang, the special commissioner of the Second District, in order to rectify the situation, in addition to ordering the county to send personnel to inspect at any time, also ordered Lian Shaoshan of Yitai soil paste store to be arrested and brought to justice for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin: North Gate Street Reconstructed into a Road</h3>
<p>The streets and markets from the North Gate to the South Gate of the county town are narrow. In order to prosper the market in Huaiyin, the Construction Office has previously built the Qingyang Highway, which will be completed soon. Now, it has ordered Liu Xunlue, the director of the road construction engineering office stationed in this county, to send personnel to survey the North Gate Street. The survey was completed on the 3rd. It is said that the buildings on both sides of the street will be demolished within a few days in accordance with the Construction Office's order, each side leaving three meters wide, and the street between the South Gate and the North Gate will be completely transformed into a road so that the East can connect to the Qingyang Road and the South can connect to the provincial road, allowing cars to travel directly from the city to Yangzhen and Pukou.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Filial Impiety Case in Tianshenggang</h3>
<p>Wang Qiao, a farmer in Tianshenggang, Tongyi, is a habitual rogue. He and his wife, Lin, collude with each other to do evil. They often ask his mother, Li, for money to squander. The other day, when he forcibly demanded money but failed, Wang Qiao and his wife pushed Wang Li to the ground and strangled her with a rope. Fortunately, neighbors heard the screams and rushed to the rescue. Wang Li was on the verge of death and was sent to the hospital. Wang Qiao and Wang Lin were arrested and sent to the court.</p>
<h3>Flower Shops in Four Townships Stop Weighing</h3>
<p>The cotton harvest in various parts of Tong is coming to an end this autumn, but the price of cotton has soared, exceeding the Shanghai market by almost one yuan per load. When the price falls, the cotton farmers are unwilling to sell. At the moment, the flower shops in the four townships have stopped weighing because they are suffering heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Wheat Can Be Sown After Rain</h3>
<p>Since autumn, the four townships of Yangcheng have suffered from severe drought, and it has been impossible to sow wheat. In the areas along the lakes and rivers, only about one-tenth or two-tenths of the land has been wheeled to sow wheat. Recently, Tingnan counties and Anhui Province have received rain in order. The farmers were eagerly awaiting rain. Fortunately, on the evening of the 5th, the sky suddenly became cloudy, followed by drizzle, which did not stop all night. It was heavier in the morning and continued all day. According to experienced farmers, it is enough to sow wheat. However, the price of rice continues to increase.</p>
<h3>Dredging the Majia River</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Construction Bureau, in order to dredge the Majia River in Xiaohu Township, District 6, estimates that it is 1,500 meters long and requires more than 4,500 labor days. A special commissioner has been sent to survey and determine the route so that construction can begin as soon as possible. Fearing that ignorant people will come out to obstruct the work, a proclamation has been presented to the county government for publication so that everyone will know and cooperate with the dredging.</p>

<p>Feng Guifu, the former township head of Jiangjiang Town in Yinxian District 7, handled the Tashan Sand Washing Association. The association's affairs were abandoned, and the accounts were secretly kept from the public. The current township head, Ge Yuancong, and Cai Hekeng, the representative of the Yin East Cai Family Charitable Estate, which donated the association's property, have reported to the county government one after another. The county government believes that the matter concerns local public funds and has immediately sent personnel to secretly investigate. It is learned that the investigation results confirmed that the reported points were all facts and have been reported to the county government for review.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Strict Prevention of Track Sabotage</h3>
<p>The Special Commissioner's Office of District 3 received a provincial order yesterday stating that the Hang-Yong Road has already begun to be built. There are currently unscrupulous people stealing railway ancillary items, hoping to sabotage and create trouble. They should be punished as obstructing military affairs. The military and police in the area should assist the Road Bureau to earnestly arrest them and punish them severely according to military law. Special Commissioner He has forwarded the order to his subordinates to earnestly comply.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Long-Awaited Sweet Rain</h3>
<p>Since autumn, the counties in northern Anhui have felt that there is little rainfall and the weather is dry, and the drought is abnormal. For two months, there has been no heavy rain. The fields are cracked, and it is difficult to sow wheat. Drought conditions have become a disaster in various places, causing farmers to worry. Grain prices have soared, which is due to this. Fortunately, on the evening of the 5th, dark clouds were densely covered, followed by light rain. Before noon the next day, it continued to drizzle until the afternoon. Although it was light rain, the fields were well-moistened, and wheat was easily sown. The farmers were all rejoicing.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Tobacco Industry in Guangdong Province Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>The two tobacco and tobacco leaf associations of Guangdong Province, as well as the farmers, elected representatives Wu Yuqiang, Su Dingchuan, Lu Yinong, and Fang Yuwan, a total of four people, to go to Beijing to petition, requesting the abolition of the monopoly on local tobacco. The representatives arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and have been preparing written justifications in recent days, separately requesting assistance from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Association of Shanghai Compatriots, and other relevant organizations. At noon yesterday, they also hosted reporters from various newspapers in this city at the YMCA, stating various obstructive circumstances, and decided to go to Beijing tomorrow (Monday) to separately submit petitions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, requesting the abolition of the monopoly in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The remarks made by the representatives at yesterday's reception are recorded as follows: 1. Fundamentally violating the law: Investigating changes to the tax system is the special prerogative of the central government. Unless it is approved by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, it is not effective. The Guangdong Province local tobacco monopoly was an act of seizing profits from the people by high-pressure means during Chen Jitang's occupation and has no legal basis. Now that unification has been achieved, all illegal and harsh taxes in Guangdong Province are being gradually abolished. Only this monopoly continues to be implemented, which violates the central government's intention to start anew with the people of Guangdong. 2. Not in line with national conditions: At the beginning of the implementation of the monopoly, it was justified by the effective implementation in Germany and Japan, so it was imitated. How could they know that Japan initially had no tobacco production, so it used control to reject foreign imports? Germany also had insufficient supply to meet demand, so it used monopoly production and sales to stem leaks. Moreover, the tax systems of both countries are uniform, the political situation is on track, and social organizations are sound, capable of encouraging planting, mechanical manufacturing, and increasing production through collective farms, achieving the effect of collecting ample taxes and benefiting the people. Our country has a vast territory and only implements it in a corner of Guangdong Province. Guangdong farmers are scattered and plant separately, purely using manual manufacturing. The environment is completely different. How can we expect to reap its benefits? 3. Destroying production: Guangdong Province is an import-surplus province, relying on local tobacco production to slightly maintain the lifeline of the social economy. Now, since the monopoly has been in place for half a year, tobacco merchants have all been eliminated, and hundreds of thousands of workers who rely on this for a living have all become unemployed. In addition, the monopoly is taxed double the price (for example, if the value of the goods is 50 yuan, a tax of 50 yuan is levied, plus a monopoly fee of 1.6%). Merchants' costs increase, making sales difficult. Tobacco merchants are also struggling to survive. As a result of the drawbacks, domestic tobacco will inevitably gradually decline. 4. Unique tax system: Investigating the regulations for the collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes in the seven provinces promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, the maximum shall not exceed 30% of the value. In the past, local tobacco in Guangdong Province had already been taxed more than 140% of the value, with the heaviest burden in the country. Now, the monopoly has intensified, with officials seizing private enterprises, and taxes are levied at 100% of the value, treating a corner of Guangdong Province as outside of civilization, using it as a testing ground for new policies. How can this be said to be fair when considering the central government's unified tax system laws? The above are just a few of the major points. Other various malpractices are difficult to enumerate, directly undermining commerce and indirectly reducing tax sources. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's instructions in Guangdong also emphasized the absolute elimination of control and monopolies that compete with the people for profits, expressing his intention three times, which is clear evidence. Shanghai is the commercial center of our country, and the press especially wields the authority of national public opinion. We hope that you will impartially criticize this legacy of the warlords and urge the government to listen to public opinion and abolish it as soon as possible to alleviate the people's difficulties. The people of Guangdong will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Has Been Collected for a Month; The Ministry of Finance Announces the Payment of Taxes; Various Agencies and Banks in This City Comply with the Order to Settle and Pay; The Bankers' Association Notifies Preparations for the Collection of Savings Interest Tax</h3>
<p>The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has announced the payment of taxes after one month since the collection of income tax on salaries and compensation of public officials and interest on securities began on October 1. Various agencies in this city will report and remit the taxes. The Bankers' Association has been ordered to notify various banks to actively prepare for the procedures for collecting income tax on savings interest. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Announcement</p>
<p>The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance issued Announcement No. 470 yesterday, stating, "It is found that income tax is now being collected. All local taxes should be uniformly paid to the local Central Bank for verification and receipt. In places without a Central Bank, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, as well as the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, have been entrusted by the bank to jointly handle the matter. In places without the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, other collection agencies have also been entrusted by the Central Bank to collect the taxes. Taxpayers are requested to directly pay to the aforementioned places in their local area. This is a special announcement."</p>
<p>Association Notice</p>
<p>The Bankers' Association of this city notified various banks in a letter yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern, We have recently received Letter No. 349 from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating, 'It is found that the Shanghai Bankers' Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry to postpone the collection of income tax on third-class savings interest. The Ministry has presented it to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government, which approved the postponement of the collection to January 1, 1937, and notified all relevant parties. Now that there are only two months until the collection date, all procedures should be actively prepared to ensure that the collection can begin on schedule and avoid delays. In addition to separate letters, we hereby request that you check and inform all colleagues and branch offices to implement this matter in a practical manner, etc.' Upon receiving this, we hereby inform all banks, hoping that you will check and comply." After receiving the letters, various banks immediately notified their branch offices to comply.</p>
<p>Payment of Taxes</p>
<p>After being ordered to collect income tax on salaries and compensation of public officials, various agencies in this city were visited by personnel from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, who came to Shanghai to discuss the collection procedures and issued collection guidelines and forms, etc. Therefore, the collection was quite convenient for various agencies. Now that the collection period has been one month, according to regulations, taxes must be paid monthly. Currently, the heads of various agencies are instructing their accounting staff to deduct the taxes payable by all public officials for October in accordance with the regulations, prepare a list of taxpayers, and remit the taxes to the Central Bank, which collects the taxes, for reporting and payment to the national treasury. Various banks and money houses that have settled the income tax on government bond interest have also withheld and paid the taxes in accordance with the law. As for the total amount of income tax paid by various agencies and banks in this city, as the payments have not yet been completed, the office stationed by the Income Tax Affairs Office has no statistics yet.</p>

<h3>Five Measures for Mr. Duan's Funeral Arrangements</h3>
<p>The Duan Ziquan Funeral Office and Mr. Duan's family held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the funeral arrangements and agreed on five measures: (1) The Funeral Office will be established soon and will be divided into groups to handle affairs. (2) Funeral expenses will be in accordance with Mr. Duan's will, keeping everything frugal. (3) In accordance with Mr. Duan's will, no obituary will be issued, only public announcements in newspapers. (4) The wake will be held on December 6. (5) The coffin will be temporarily placed in the Shanghai residence until the National Funeral Office is established, and then a decision will be made.</p>
<p>After Mr. Duan Qirui's death, the central government has decided to hold a national funeral. It is reported that the central government is currently seeking the opinions of Mr. Duan's family regarding Mr. Duan's burial site. According to news from the Duan residence funeral office yesterday, Mr. Duan, during his lifetime, because his life's work was mostly in Beiping, had expressed his wish to be buried in the Western Hills outside Beiping after his death. Therefore, regarding the future burial site of Mr. Duan, the possibility of the Western Hills is greater, and it is unlikely to be buried in Shanghai or Beijing, and Hefei is also unlikely. The Funeral Office continued to receive many condolences yesterday. Among them, the couplet from Ma Xiangbo, a 97-year-old man, reads, "Han Gao resisted the imperial edict, Ma Chang swore an oath, overturning autocracy twice and supporting the republic. How can we bear that the bandits are so numerous and suddenly lose an experienced general?" "Yan City lived in peace, and the Shanghai River cultivated hope. He recited scriptures quietly in his life and played chess leisurely in his spare time. Just as we were happy about the unification of the rivers and mountains, it was like the last move in a game of chess." In addition, condolence messages were received from Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Director of Fujian, Liu Jianxu, the Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, and Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area, and many other telegrams.</p>

<h3>Ping An Company's Baohua Steamer Robbed by Pirates Outside Wusong Estuary; No Passengers Spared; A Stray Bullet Grazed One Passenger; Carried the Loot to Yaguo Port in Chongming and Boarded a Sailboat to Escape; The Company Telegraphed the Military and Police Authorities to Strictly Pursue the Pirates</h3>
<p>The Ping An Company's Baohua Steamer, sailing from Shanghai to Qidong, the shipowner is Wang Yunfa, and the comprador is Dong Chunfang, departed from Shanghai to Chongming Qidong at 5:00 p.m. on the sixth. Because the Xinren and other ships were not open due to furnace repairs, the Baohua was very crowded when it set sail, with a total of more than 500 passengers. Pirates boarded the ship in Shanghai posing as passengers. There were a total of sixteen pirates. When they were on the ship, most of them wore magnificent clothes, woolen hats, and glasses, and lived in the common cabin. There were many people on the ship, and no one paid attention. At 7:30 p.m., the ship had reached outside Wusong. Dinner was being served on the ship, and the crew and passengers were preparing to sleep after dinner. At this time, suddenly four or five pirates wandered back and forth inside and outside the cabin, looking around. The crew still regarded them as pickpockets and told them to be careful.</p>
<p>Surrounding the Maritime Police</p>
<p>The ship had two escorting police officers from the Qingtiantian warship in Haimen to protect it. At 7:30 p.m., the two police officers were having dinner in their room. Unexpectedly, the pirates had been paying attention to them for a long time. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, two bandits suddenly opened fire with a pistol in front of the marine police cabin and immediately rushed in, forcing the two police officers to hand over their guns, otherwise they would be killed. The two police officers said they had no guns. One police officer resisted slightly and was beaten with a gun butt by a bandit, suffering minor injuries. Finally, the two bandits searched the marine police room and found one pistol and one box cannon, and 50 bullets, all of which were copied.</p>
<p>Robbery Situation</p>
<p>There were sixteen pirates, eight of whom had guns, half of whom spoke in local dialect, and half of whom spoke in the North Shazhou dialect. When they started at 7:30 p.m., the pirates took off their long clothes and changed into short clothes. While surrounding the marine police, two bandits went to the driver's platform to monitor the shipowner Wang Yunfa, who personally led the port and drove the ship. At the same time, two bandits went to the machine room to manage the engine, indicating that the bandits also had maritime talents. Two other bandits saw that the accounting room had finished collecting tickets and the room was counting banknotes. The two bandits immediately opened fire on it, breaking the glass door of the accounting room, and the bullet grazed a passenger. The bandits immediately entered and forced the accounting room to hand over all the cash.</p>
<p>Total Losses</p>
<p>More than 460 yuan in cash tickets were robbed from the accounting room, as well as 80 yuan in remittances carried by passengers. The crew's clothes, belongings, and private funds, and the cash from the ship's tea room were all searched. As for the passengers, the bandits first drove the passengers from the cabins to the lower cabin. When they arrived in the lower cabin, they searched each person one by one, robbed them of cash and belongings, and then escorted them to the cargo hold and locked everyone up. Passengers in the second and fourth cabins had about 1,100 yuan in wedding gifts and decorations, and a passenger surnamed Yan had 500 yuan, all of which were robbed. The losses of the remaining 500 passengers were no less than 1,000 yuan. The total loss is estimated at around 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sated Loot and Escape</p>
<p>The pirates started robbing from 7:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. After the robbery was over, the ship had reached the sea near Yaguo Port. The pirates immediately dropped anchor and stopped the ship. The pirates then burned the "Lauterbach book" (a record of navigation for the shipping bureau) in the shipowner's room as a signal. Immediately, two pre-arranged punts came and shouted, "Is this the Xinren He Steamer?" The pirates said, "This is the Baohua. Our goal has been achieved." The punts then approached, and the pirates carried the loot onto the boat. The pirates then boarded the punts one after another. Before leaving, they fired two more shots with pistols to demonstrate and escape.</p>
<p>The Ship Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>When the pirates were about to leave, they forced the crew to break off a screw from the cylinder head in the machine room, took one, and said they would borrow it for a while. After taking it, they threw it into the sea, and the Baohua Steamer could not travel. Before leaving, they also said to the ship's accountant, "When you get to Shanghai, if the newspapers come to inquire, tell them that the loss was only 2,000 yuan. Don't say too much about the amount. Our business this time was not bad." After the pirates left, the crew tried to fix the cylinder head with lead skin after seven hours of effort. They were able to sail until yesterday morning, but it was difficult to go to Chongming, so they had to return to Shanghai. At 12:15 noon yesterday, they finally arrived in Shanghai. The captain reported to the company, and the passengers who had been robbed also went ashore. The ship needs to repair the cylinder and is currently docked at the Nanshi Pier.</p>
<p>Telegraphs for Arresting Thieves</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, shipowner Wang and comprador Dong went to the Shanghai Company at 214 Nanshi Wai Ma Road and reported the incident to General Manager Dong Lianchen, Manager Li Yaoting, and Assistant Manager Chen Yisheng. The General Manager immediately submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Shipping Bureau, the Shanghai Steamer Industry Association, and the Jianghai Customs Maritime Public Security Bureau. In addition to reporting the incident, he also requested strict arrest of the pirates to protect the safety of passengers. He also telegraphed the military and police agencies in Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen counties, requesting strict arrest of the pirates.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Public Debt Consolidation Is Completely Printed; Notice to Quickly Exchange for New Bonds</h3>
<p>The 60 million yuan of Zhejiang Province Public Debt Consolidation for the 25th year of the Republic of China was entrusted by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance to the Central, China, Communications, Local, and other four banks and their affiliated branches and offices, and the county governments of each county to exchange and redeem in four installments. This public debt has now been completely printed. The Department of Finance has issued it to various banks. For example, the Shanghai Branch of the Zhejiang Local Bank received this new public debt yesterday and specially notified all sectors that those holding the temporary receipts that have been exchanged should quickly exchange them for formal public debt. Those holding old bonds who have not exchanged them for new bonds should quickly go to the bank for exchange, because the first lottery for repayment of principal and interest has been scheduled for November 11. This concerns the benefits of winning the lottery, and it is hoped that all bondholders will not delay.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Syndicate Established Preparatory Office Yesterday; Capital of One Million; Banks Have Committed 800,000; The Remaining 200,000 Will Be Requested by the Ministry of Industry from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Syndicate, jointly established by the Ministry of Industry and the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks, established a preparatory office yesterday afternoon. Each bank committed funds, and Qian Xinzhi and others were appointed as preparatory committee members. After the procedures are completed, it will be formally established. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned the details and recorded them below:</p>
<p>Consultations Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Twelve banks are participating in the Fisheries Syndicate, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Dalu Bank, the Yanye Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Si Ming Bank, the Zhonghui Bank, the Xinhua Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association. The Ministry of Industry sent a letter requesting Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Dong Yanfang to prepare. A draft plan has been drawn up, and a luncheon was held at the Bank Club yesterday afternoon to discuss the progress, attended by representatives from each bank, including Cheng Muhao, Wang Shaoxian, Dong Chengdao, Wang Zhixin, Qian Xinzhi, Yang Weichang, Zhou Desun, Cao Jiru, Chen Guangting, Jin Caisheng, etc. Qian Xinzhi was unanimously elected as the temporary chairman.</p>
<p>Preparations</p>
<p>During the meeting, Qian Xinzhi first reported on the progress of the preparations, stating that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the decline of the fishing industry in recent years, proposed the organization of a Fisheries Syndicate to engage in relief. This spring, Minister Wu reported at a tea party with bankers in Shanghai, which was approved by all the banks. The Ministry also drafted an outline, which was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting. A total of twelve banks participated at that time, and Wang Zhixin and Yang Yanfang and this person were responsible for the preparations. At that time, because the various rules and regulations were still being drafted, the establishment was delayed. However, the fishermen urgently needed relief because the winter fishing season was approaching, so the three banks first raised 120,000 yuan and lent them separately to the Yinxian Fisheries Cooperative and the wholesalers of the fish market, who then lent them to the fishing boats. A special report was attached.</p>
<p>Capital Commitment</p>
<p>The syndicate's capital is set at 1 million yuan, with the Ministry of Industry undertaking 200,000 yuan, and a letter has been sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting allocation. The other 800,000 yuan will be undertaken by each bank. It was decided on the spot yesterday to divide it into 40 shares, with each share being 20,000 yuan. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications jointly subscribed for 11 shares (220,000 yuan). Si Ming subscribed for 2 shares (40,000 yuan). Shanghai, Dalu, Jin Cheng, Yanye, Zhongnan, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhonghui, Xinhua, and the Four Banks Savings Association each subscribed for 3 shares (60,000 yuan each), totaling 40 shares, totaling 800,000 yuan. It was also decided to continue to appoint Qian, Wang, and Wei as preparatory committee members, with Qian Xinzhi as the convener. The preparatory office will be established immediately, and after several more meetings, the syndicate can be formally established and will begin lending in the spring fishing season next year.</p>

<h3>Minister of Railways, Mr. Zhang Gongquan's Speech: How Employees Should Strive to Fulfill Their National Defense Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency: Railway Minister Zhang Gongquan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing some time ago. At the invitation of the Railway Employees' Military Training Class, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recorded his speech as follows: Fellow railway employees, you are here today for training. I believe that when you first arrived, each of you must have had a thought in mind: "We are serving the railways, why do we need to come here for training? Military affairs are the business of soldiers, what does it have to do with railway employees?" Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity of the belated opening ceremony to solemnly say to you:</p>
<p>Railway Enterprise</p>
<p>In peacetime, it is the lifeline of transportation; in wartime, it is a sharp weapon for marching troops. Therefore, I have often said that the railway enterprise is a business of peace and also a business of war. Therefore, your training here today is directly for military training, and indirectly for your own careers, and to fulfill your own duties. There should be no special or unusual feelings about this. Furthermore, we who serve the railways must deeply understand the railway's responsibility to the nation.</p>
<p>Responsibilities in Three Areas</p>
<p>(1) Facilitating Passengers: We must ensure that the people of the whole country understand the convenience of railway transportation, sweep away the previous concept of "viewing travel as a fearful journey," and make everyone happy to travel. It must be understood that the people's concept of patriotism has a great relationship with travel. Travel can appreciate the beauty of the country's rivers and mountains, recognize the greatness of the nation, draw inspiration from the beauty of the mountains and forests, enlighten wisdom, and increase empathy through the influence of the eyes and ears. People's thoughts can be communicated, and feelings of brotherhood can be strengthened. Thus, mutual assistance and cooperation can be achieved. Mutual assistance and unity come first, and cooperation is the foundation of national salvation. Therefore, our efforts to facilitate passengers can be said to be work that enhances cooperation, friendship, and unity among the people, and inspires their patriotism and national salvation concepts. It is not just fulfilling the duties of railway employees themselves. (2) Smooth Cargo Transportation: "Smooth flow of goods" is the legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the essence of people's livelihood. However, how to transport goods from the inland to various places in the fastest and most economical way is the inescapable responsibility of our railway employees. Because after the smooth flow of goods, not only can our daily needs be met domestically, without having to rely on foreign sources, but we can also take a step further to supply the people with genuine and inexpensive goods, so that living expenses do not rise, and to make practical improvements to the overall national economy. (3) Facilitating Military Transportation: The organization of the military is like a machine, and railway transportation is a gear in this machine. As the art of war says, "Speed is of the essence in war." How to ensure that the transportation of troops and military supplies does not miss the opportunity is the responsibility of the railway. Therefore, the railway should always study equipment and train employees in peacetime, and prepare both materially and spiritually, so that its facilities can fulfill the function of military transportation. This is also the task undertaken by all railway employees. The first two are what should be paid attention to in peacetime, and the latter is what should be strived for in wartime. If we talk about the importance of national security, the latter should be the priority. Because the people must first live in peace and then enjoy their work, and only by enjoying their work can there be production and travel. If they cannot live in peace and enjoy their work, where will the transportation of goods come from? What leisure will there be for travel? Therefore, how to strengthen national power and</p>
<p>Consolidate National Defense</p>
<p>So that the people can live and work in peace is the prerequisite for fulfilling all responsibilities. However, when "national defense" is mentioned, it is often regarded as the business of the military. It is not known that the nation is an accumulation of people. Only when everyone can do their best in their own jobs can we talk about national defense. Only when everyone can serve the country can national defense be strengthened. Therefore, national defense is the responsibility of all citizens, regardless of gender, age, or status, inside and out. It cannot and must not be shirked to others. As the sages said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." However, how to fulfill the responsibility of citizens is not only something that everyone can talk about and know, but must also be practiced and implemented. Knowing without acting is equal to not knowing. The way to implement it is to embrace the idea of "the nation is supreme" and dedicate all our energy to the interests of the entire nation, sacrificing the individual for the sake of the greater good. To put it another way, we who serve the railways must identify our goals and fulfill our duties. Once an emergency occurs, we must be determined to</p>
<p>Devote Efforts to Military Support</p>
<p>And sacrifice for the country without hesitation. If we can do this, we will not fail the mission of railway employees, and we will be able to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens. At present, the international situation is tense, and all countries have established emergency agencies to prevent emergencies. For example, in the Soviet Union, railway employees are all members of the National Defense Assistance Association, which aims to popularize national defense ideas and implement military training, so that railway employees and the rear civilian population can join hands and work together to contribute to military education outside of the military, such as transportation, propaganda, air defense, and anti-poisoning. At present, this National Defense Assistance Association has become the most powerful organization in the Soviet Union's semi-military organization. The total number of members reaches more than 12 million, and railway employees account for 60 percent of them. Other organizations, such as the Military Knowledge Research Association and the Shooting Research Association, have very strict facilities for military education and military training, and railway employees are the most important members. This is because the relationship between railways and national defense is the closest. Once war breaks out, how to quickly and safely transport personnel, horses, grain, and ammunition according to the battle plan, and concentrate them at designated locations, is the most important thing in combat. In addition, the evacuation of wounded soldiers, the protection of refugees from the war zone, and the supply of military supplies must all rely on transportation agencies to adapt to the situation, so that they can be fully maintained and have the ability to sustain combat.</p>
<p>During the European War</p>
<p>The railway transportation in northern and eastern France, in just one day and night in 1915, dispatched 180 trains, 231 trains in 1916, and 267 trains in 1918. Due to the rapid transportation of military supplies, the combat capability of the expeditionary forces was ensured. The intensity of future wars will probably be several times greater than in the past. Therefore, military transportation will play an increasingly important role in war operations. Railway employees should think carefully about what important responsibilities they will bear for national defense. Our country does not yet have an organization similar to the National Defense Assistance Association. Your training here is to replace this work. (It must be known that our country is facing national crises, and the key to survival lies in self-reliance and regeneration. The way to regenerate is to be prepared for danger in times of peace and to prepare in time so that we can calmly deal with everything when emergencies come. It is important to know that the progress of the times is endless, and the responsibility of the railway also increases, changes, and becomes heavier with it. In the past, national mobilization involved at most hundreds of thousands of people. In the future, once something happens, it will involve hundreds of thousands of people. May I ask if we have this training now? Are we prepared for large-scale transportation? Can we truly take on the responsibility? In addition, with the advancement of modern science, the weapons of war are changing with each passing day. Naval, land, and air battles have moved from two-dimensional to three-dimensional competition. Therefore, military mobilization should be as fast as possible, and how to ensure safety during transportation. If we do not prepare seriously in advance, it cannot be arranged temporarily. Therefore, how to prepare effectively in terms of intelligence and equipment today is the responsibility of every railway employee. The occurrence of emergencies cannot be predicted. Once it happens, we must do our best and sacrifice ourselves to serve the country. We must also have comprehensive knowledge for the application of each department. Suppose the railway tracks are destroyed from the air, we cannot rely solely on the engineering and mechanical departments to be responsible for repairs. Everyone must have this ability to remedy it at any time. Then, when an emergency comes, one person can do the work of two, and one thing can be used for two purposes.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is not only a war of force, but also a war of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. In other words, it is also a war of whether every citizen can effectively fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, I have endless feelings and endless expectations when I speak to you here today. I sincerely hope that you will not regard yourselves as mere railway employees. Everyone must regard themselves as one of the great citizens of the Republic of China. Whether in peace or war, we must be prepared and able to fulfill our responsibilities. I was not originally familiar with the railway business. Since I took on this role, I have known that the railway business is complex and confusing. I do not know where to start in order to fulfill its due mission. However, given the time and space in which the country finds itself today, national defense is the top priority. That is why I work tirelessly every day and strive for governance, lest I be too late. And that is why I hope you will be self-reliant, strive for excellence, and make greater progress today. It cannot be denied that there are shortcomings in the spirit and discipline of the various items at present. However, the transformation of the atmosphere depends on a few people taking the lead, advocating first, and then gradually influencing and promoting it to the public. You are here for training, and after the expiration, you will return to your respective roads to teach others what you have learned. Therefore, you are only a few hundred people here, but your responsibility and influence are really above thousands of people. I deeply hope that you will hold on to your ambition and restrain your emotions, recognize the beliefs we should have and the mission we should fulfill, and adhere to it and practice it, so that the responsibility of citizens can be fulfilled and the national crisis can be alleviated.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Telegraphs the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Vigorously Suppress the Communist Bandits in Xiaofeng</h3>
<p>The Lake Society recently telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, saying: "According to a letter from our fellow townsman Xu Manxin, Xiaofeng is located in a mountainous rural area. Recently (in the past month), there have been about 400 Communist bandits occupying the southwest townships, acting arbitrarily, and the villagers cannot bear the poison. Within a radius of more than a hundred miles, the population is almost extinct. Those with a little status have taken refuge in towns, Meixi, or Huzhou. These Communist bandits are organized in a very tight manner. Due to the vigorous suppression in Ningguo and other counties in Anhui, some of them fled into Xiaofeng. Although there are local defense regiments and a small number of provincial security teams to encircle and suppress them, they are ultimately unable to achieve success due to the small number of people and incomplete firearms. The bandits arbitrarily rob everywhere. The village chiefs,保 chiefs, or 甲 chiefs are either kidnapped or shot. If they have any property, they are kidnapped for ransom. They are equipped with firearms and are located in the deep mountains, so it may not be easy to encircle and suppress them without a large army. If this continues, it will spread, and not only Xiaofeng County's life and property will be harmed. Therefore, we sincerely state the actual situation and request that you immediately telegraph the provincial government to send a large army to encircle and suppress them, so as to eliminate them as soon as possible, which is the blessing of our fellow townsmen." Upon receiving the information, the Society found that Xiaofeng borders Anhui Province, and the mountains are intertwined, which has always been a den for bandits. This time, the Communist bandits disturbed the people, and if they are not vigorously suppressed soon, they will spread to neighboring towns. Therefore, we specially telegraph you, asking you to immediately transfer to the Security Department to send troops to encircle and suppress them, in order to maintain security. We are compelled to make this statement and hope you will consider it. Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee, bows, fish.</p>
<h3>Tao Guilin Discusses the Cement Price Increase Problem</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency saw a report in the newspaper yesterday about the current state of cement companies' business and specially visited Mr. Tao Guilin of the construction industry. According to his views, the cement manufacturers have recently raised prices twice, and the total price per barrel has reached more than six yuan. The reason is unknown. However, according to the market price in the 24th year of the Republic (the average price per barrel in the first half of the 24th year was 5.5 yuan, and the average price per barrel in the second half was 3.5 yuan), the average was only 4.5 yuan. However, the China Cement Company's year-end settlement report shows that in addition to the government profit, dividend, and depreciation, a large amount has been proposed, and there is still a sufficient surplus. Judging from the actual situation, the cement cost and selling price of 4.5 yuan may be an appropriate number. Compared with the current price and the price last year, the difference is very high. What is the reason? I dare not say. Recently, the sales volume of cement has increased sharply, mostly due to the needs of national construction. I believe that cement manufacturers should increase their production to meet the demand, and the cost can be reduced due to the increase in production, so as to reduce the government's burden. If cement manufacturers take the opportunity to raise prices, the country will directly bear a heavy burden, and our industry will indirectly suffer intangible losses. However, since we are all Chinese people, there is no worry about external leakage. However, in this critical period, our industry is very willing to help each other with cement manufacturers, share the same boat, and serve the country. This is my wish, or it may be the enthusiasm of all compatriots in the country. Finally, Mr. Tao hopes that cement manufacturers can have an appropriate standard pricing to avoid inconsistent prices, so that the construction industry can also obtain a price guarantee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Woman Attempts Suicide in Huangpu River and is Rescued; Chinese Police Receive Awards and Recognition; Japanese Consulate Sends Representatives to Express Gratitude Yesterday Morning; Awards Ceremony Held at the North Station Branch</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 19th of last month, a Japanese woman named Sayoko Matsumoto attempted suicide in the Huangpu River in Wusong Town. After being rescued by police officer Xie Ziyuan of the Wusong Police Station under the jurisdiction of the area, the responsible officer notified the Japanese Consulate to take her back. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau gave the police officer an extraordinary commendation and promoted him to police chief. Mr. Wu Gongshan of the Japanese Uchiyama Bookstore also awarded him ten yuan to commend his meritorious service. It is now known that Police Inspector (i.e., Second-Class Police Officer) Tabei of the Japanese Consulate Police Department, representing Chief Tajima, and Chongwei Nakayama, the owner of the rescued Japanese woman, arrived at the North Station Branch at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and met with Branch Chief Liang. They said, "On the night of the 19th of last month, our Japanese woman Sayoko Matsumoto threw herself into the river in Wusong Town. Police officer Xie Ziyuan of your bureau bravely entered the water and rescued her, so she was safe. Not only does our consulate express its gratitude, but all the residents in Shanghai also express their deep gratitude. Our Chief was unable to come in person to express his gratitude due to business, so he entrusted me to come and present police officer Xie with a certificate of award and a monetary award. The owner of the rescued woman, Chongwei Nakayama, also presented a marble clock to express his gratitude, which is far from enough to express one ten-thousandth of our gratitude." Branch Chief Liang Fu-chu代 of the North Station Branch accepted the award and expressed his gratitude, saying, "Police officer Xie Ziyuan of the Wusong Police Station was only fulfilling the duties of a police officer. We are deeply grateful for the praise of the officials and people of your country. Today, we have received the certificate of award and souvenirs from your Chief, and I represent Chief Cai in expressing my deep gratitude." Those present at the scene included Wu Xiong, Chief of the Central Branch of the Municipal Police, Zhan Chun, Chief of the Wusong Police Station, and Police Officer Xie Ziyuan. After Chief Liang received the awards, he transferred them to Chief Zhan, who handed them over to Police Chief Xie Ziyuan for collection.</p>
<h3>New Factory Inspection Measures</h3>
<p>An overseas news agency translated a report from the mainland, saying that regarding the factory inspection problem in the Special Zone, it was recently heard that the Ministry of Industry, following the wishes of the Municipal Council, has drafted implementation rules in accordance with the Chinese Factory Law, which is expected to solve the problem. The Municipal Government of this city will follow the government's instructions and continue to negotiate with the Municipal Council authorities based on the points agreed upon by both parties. However, all the details of this issue are currently lacking formal reports. The Ministry of Industry's agreement to the Municipal Council's proposal should open a new path for the future of negotiations on the previous draft that was rejected by the consular body. According to the proposal, Municipal Council Director General Fessenden suggested to Municipal Government Secretary Yu Hongjun, hoping to ease the differences between the Chinese side's territorial sovereignty and the various countries' consular jurisdiction. According to the consular body's statement opposing the draft, the implementation of the Chinese Factory Law on foreigners enjoying consular jurisdiction is tantamount to hindering the rights that should be enjoyed under the treaty. However, the Chinese side believes that factory inspection is a Chinese administrative right and cannot allow any treaty country's consular jurisdiction to infringe upon it. In order to ease this difference, Fessenden suggested that the Municipal Council, based on the Chinese Factory Law, draft its own implementation rules for inspection and list them as one of the regulations. All factories in the area, regardless of the nationality of the factory owner, should be implemented uniformly. In this way, the Municipal Council can implement the management of industrial institutions within its own scope of authority. In addition to this technical change, other rules obtained by the Yu and Liang after five years of negotiation have not been changed. At present, the measures proposed by the Municipal Council are the same as those stipulated in the draft rejected by the consular body. The implementation of the inspection rules will be carried out by personnel with equal numbers of Chinese and foreigners. The new measures were previously considered by the Ministry of Industry and then by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>First Special District Bailiff Miao Changzhen Accused: Who Altered the Receipt? Qian Xingcun Claims Li Pu Told Him About the Alteration and Excessive Collection; Defense Lawyer Lists Li Pu's Past Facts</h3>
<p>Miao Changzhen from Zhenjiang, a bailiff in the First Special District Court, 29 years old, residing at No. 63 Yongqing Lane, Love Lane, was accused of altering the delivery fee of eight cents to two yuan and eight cents when he was ordered to deliver a payment order to Qian Xingcun on the upper floor of Wanfeng Sauce Garden, No. 499 Fangbang Road, on the 28th of last month. Qian reported him to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court. Prosecutor Song Genshan opened a court to investigate and concluded the investigation, took Miao into custody, and filed a public prosecution with the same-level court for the crimes of fraud, alteration of official documents, and dereliction of duty. Miao Changzhen was a public official and should have his original sentence increased in accordance with Article 134 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. The defendant Miao Changzhen hired lawyer Li Lin to appear in court as his defense. Miao Changzhen stated that he was a bailiff in the First Special District Court. On the 28th of last month, he was ordered to deliver a payment order to Wanfeng Sauce Garden, No. 499 Fangbang Road, and handed it to a person. However, he did not ask whether the recipient was Qian Xingcun at the time. The recipient paid him a delivery fee of eight cents in silver. The receipt now shows a figure of one yuan and eight cents. He does not know who filled in this figure. He only received eight cents at the time. At this point, his defense lawyer Li Lin said that the lawyer had investigated the case at the Shenxiangge Public Security Bureau. There is no Qian Xingcun on the household registration record at No. 499 Fangbang Road. The person who filed the report with the court was actually Li Pu, also known as Li Jinqing. The matter was instigated and provoked by Li Pu. Li passed the Second Judicial District Bailiff Examination and was a candidate for bailiff, but he has not been appointed to a substantive vacancy. If one of the bailiffs in the court is transferred, he hopes to be appointed to a substantive vacancy. Li Pu is currently an employee of the Yangtze Hotel and often represents litigants in court. His home is on the upper floor of the sauce garden at No. 499 Fangbang Road. He is actually a litigator. This point should be noted. Furthermore, if the defendant did forge official documents and defraud Qian Xingcun, he would definitely use the same method on Kangren, the opposing party of Qian Xingcun. The lawyer has obtained the delivery receipt of the opposing party and it has not been altered, which is submitted as evidence in rebuttal. Qian Xingcun stated that he was 41 years old, from Huzhou, and engaged in the silk business. He lived on the upper floor of the sauce garden at No. 499 Fangbang Road. Li Pu is his brother-in-law. His sister Qian Acan is married to Li as his wife, so he lives with Li. When the defendant delivered the payment order and collected a delivery fee of one yuan and eight cents, he was out. Later, Li Pu told him that there was an altered receipt and an overcharge of one yuan. Therefore, Li drafted a report and reported it to the court for investigation. Pan Shizhong, a clerk in the First Special District Court, testified that the figure of one yuan on the delivery receipt was added by someone else. Witness Zhu Dianyuan stated that he was an apprentice in Wanfeng Sauce Garden and testified that he代收 the payment order and 代钱 sign. At the time, because he saw that the receipt stated one yuan and eight cents, he asked Zhu Zhenfang, Li Pu's wife, for the money. Zhu first took out eight cents in silver and twelve cents in small coins, which he handed over. Later, because the person who came to collect the money did not accept small coins, he exchanged them for a one-dollar bill. He could not remember whether the person was the defendant, but his height and hair were not similar. Witness woman Zhu Zhenfang testified that Li Pu is her husband and Qian Xingcun's wife is her sister. That day, Zhu Dianyuan代收 the document and said that it required one yuan and eight cents. She took down a nickel coin of one yuan and eight cents from upstairs and asked Zhu to hand it over. Later, because the person who came to collect the money did not accept it, Zhu Dianyuan asked the sauce garden accounting room to exchange the nickel coin for a one-dollar bill. Finally, the defendant's lawyer stated that Li Pu had also accused three bailiffs, Wang Liang, Gong Kuan, etc., in the Second Special District Court last year. He requested an investigation into this point to prove Li's character. Judge Feng ruled that the case still needed to be investigated, ordered the defendant to be returned to custody, and rescheduled the hearing for next Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Robbers Acted Calmly Last Night, Major Robbery Case on Fenzhou Road, Jinchang Sand Casting Suffered Heavy Losses, Four Robbers Searched and Robbed with Guns, Called Xiang Sheng Taxi to Escape, Police are Investigating Intensively</h3>
<p>Cao Weiyang from Hubei, who works in sand casting, opened the Cao Jinchang Sand Casting Shop at No. 16, Fenzhou Lane (intersection of Fenzhou Road and Yangzhou Road). Because he had some savings, he was targeted by robbers. At about 9:40 p.m. last night, while Cao Weiyang was taking a bath in the bathhouse, four robbers suddenly came to his house. They were wearing long black cloth gowns, long magenta woolen gowns, and short blue cloth jackets. Two robbers held handguns, and two robbers held sharp axes. They first knocked on the door and falsely claimed to be visiting Cao Laoban. Then they reached in and pulled out the door bolt and rushed in. First, they drove the apprentices in the shop to the second-floor loft and locked them up. Then, they locked the men and women on the second and third floors together in the living room on the second floor, forbidding them to make any noise, and sent one robber to guard them with a gun. The remaining robbers went straight to the third floor, broke into Cao's bedroom, and began to search and rob, turning over boxes and cabinets. Around 10:20 p.m., the three robbers retreated, carrying out a large leather suitcase and two handheld suitcases, and took them downstairs to the living room. At the same time, one robber used the sand casting shop's own telephone to call the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, instructing them to send a car to Yangzhou Road to wait, and asked someone to greet them there. The robbers also told the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company that the person hiring the car was from No. 16, Fenzhou Lane, and the telephone number was 53222. After finishing speaking, they hung up the phone. One robber went outside to wait for the car. After receiving the call, the Xiang Sheng Company immediately notified the 18th branch station on Huade Road and dispatched taxi No. 18476 to provide service. Upon arriving at Yangzhou Road, someone was indeed greeting them and instructed the driver to wait a moment. The robber returned to No. 16 with the other three robbers, carried out the three suitcases, put them in the car, and sped away. By the time the apprentices regained their freedom and tracked them out of the lane, the robbers had already disappeared. They immediately telegraphed the Yulin Road Police Station to report, and the police sent detectives to investigate. They also inquired with the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company about the license plate number of the car hired from No. 16, telegraphed various police agencies, and requested their cooperation in apprehending the robbers. At around 11:30 p.m., the car was indeed discovered on the Bund of Edward Road and was immediately impounded. It was learned that the robbers had gotten off near Mintini Alley in the French Concession. At the time, the driver did not know that he was carrying robbers. After the patrol officer informed him of the case, he was taken to the police station and transferred to Yulin Road for investigation. Meanwhile, the loss was investigated. It was reported that nine gold rings, three gemstone rings, one gold watch, two women's watches, three pairs of gold bracelets, and one silver dollar were robbed. All the leather clothing and more expensive clothes were stored in the three suitcases and taken away, with a great value. Afterwards, according to neighbors, two of the four robbers had very familiar faces and all had pockmarks. The fact that the robbers dared to act so calmly and hire a car to escape after the robbery is truly an innovation in robbery cases. Therefore, the police are now sending detectives everywhere, rigorously searching for the robbers' tracks, and striving to arrest them and solve the case as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Fashion Workers' Strike, Fifteen People Sentenced for Obstructing Bodily Injury and Freedom, Fourteen Detained, One Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Due to wage reductions and other issues by employers and foremen in various fashion stores in this city, a general strike was triggered, which has lasted for several days. With the mediation of Party and government agencies, the Garment Industry Union deemed it satisfactory and issued a notice the night before, allowing all workers to resume work yesterday morning. However, at around 2:00 p.m. the day before, a large group of striking workers, in the Laozao Police Station area of the Public Concession, prevented workers from fashion companies from going to work, demanding unified action without success, which led to beatings and injuries. Chinese and Western detectives from the police station rushed to suppress the situation and arrested the rioting workers, including (1) Wu Jinzhang, (2) Chen Rongcai, (3) Qian Zhongbao, (4) Chen Hongpin, (5) Wei Youcai, (6) Wang Shukun, (7) Lu Hehong, (8) Yu Ajun, (9) Zhang Asan, (10) Zai Maosong, (11) Luo Zhiting, (12) Jiang Guoman, (13) Tong Shaofu, (14) Zhang Along, (15) Chen Zongjie, along with the weapon, a washboard, and detained them in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 304 of the Criminal Law, obstruction of freedom, and stated the case, saying that at 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the first to sixth defendants, along with many others, broke into the Xinguang Clothing Store at No. 200, Hubei Road, and demanded that the foreman Lu A'gen and the other eighteen workers join the strike and increase wages. They immediately threatened violence. Lu A'gen stated that the employer of this store did not deduct wages and expressed unwillingness to accept. The group then wanted to commit violence. Lu, seeing the situation was not good, escaped from the back door. The group chased after him, beating him with fists and wooden sticks. The first defendant threw a washboard at him, causing injuries to Lu's head and back. Lu immediately grabbed the first defendant and called for help from patrol officers No. 2359, who arrested the first to sixth defendants. More than ten others escaped. The seventh to tenth defendants broke into the Dachina Fashion Store at No. 704, Hankou Road, at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday, inciting the strike. The foreman Qiao Zhenfang, seeing that there were many people and the situation was overwhelming, immediately stopped work. He went to the store, and the group suspected that Qiao was going out to report to the police, so they rushed into the factory, wantonly making trouble, and throwing tables and other objects outside. The Chinese police arrested the seventh defendant. While taking him to the Laozao Police Station, when passing near the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road, the eighth defendant and others followed behind, shouting "Beat the patrol officer." The Chinese police arrested the eighth defendant. Unexpectedly, the ninth and tenth defendants, disregarding the law, continued to shout and incite passersby, intending to snatch the arrested suspect. The ninth and tenth defendants were arrested and taken to the police station. The remaining eleventh to fourteenth defendants, at 2:10 p.m. yesterday, after the Dachina case occurred, because some workers returned to the store, intending to continue working, a group of strikers rushed into the store again, dragged the worker Lu Fulin out, intending to drag him to the Garment Union at No. 15, Lane 614, Fuzhou Road. He was arrested on Hankou Road and Guangxi Road. The fifteenth defendant dragged the worker Ni Songfei into the union, beat him, and dragged him from the union to Yuqiaqing Road, where he was arrested. Therefore, Ni suffered internal injuries. In view of this type of case, which has occurred frequently recently, the Municipal Council believes that the defendants are making unreasonable demands, disrupting the security of the concession, and the situation is serious, and should be severely punished. According to the testimonies of witnesses Lu A'gen, Lu Fulin, and Ni Songfei, the defendants Wu Jinzhang and others hired lawyer Fan Gang to appear in court as their defense. After the court investigation by Ye Shengchao, the defendants were sentenced. The court sentenced the first to sixth defendants to 50 days of detention for jointly injuring others, the seventh to tenth defendants to 40 days of detention for jointly coercing and obstructing others from exercising their rights, the eleventh to fourteenth defendants to 50 days of detention for jointly detaining and depriving others of their freedom of action, and the fifteenth defendant to two months of imprisonment for the same crime.</p>
<h3>Tram Conductor Attempted Suicide by Drowning, Saved and Not Beheaded</h3>
<p>Zhu Huiren, No. 330, a ticket seller of the Public Concession Tram Company, 41 years old, lived at No. 3, Linhe Lane, Huishan Road. Yesterday (the 7th) at about 11:30 a.m., he wandered on the bank of the Suzhou River at the south end of the Zhabu Road Bridge. Suddenly, he jumped into the river, attempting suicide. A boatman heard the sound and immediately rescued him, preventing him from being submerged. Later, someone reported to the patrolling Chinese patrol officer No. 3389, who took him to the Central Police Station and transferred him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Under questioning by the police chief, he confessed that he was falsely accused by ticket inspector No. 127 of the company, which led to his dismissal. He had been working for the tram company for more than ten years, and now he had come to such an end, he had no face, and he had a 73-year-old mother above and a wife and children below, and he had no savings, and life was so difficult, he thought it was better to die.</p>
<h3>Foreign Car Injured Couple, Disaster Struck on the Way Back from Sightseeing, Indian Patrol Officer Saw Them Bleeding</h3>
<p>Zhang Liying, an actor, 31 years old, from Beijing, has been performing in Kaifeng. At the beginning of this month, he and his wife, Ms. Ma, 23 years old, set off for Shanghai and resided at No. 4, Xinglongfang, Chongqing Road. Last night, Zhang and Ms. Ma, having long heard of the prosperity of Shanghai, went out for sightseeing. They strolled along and arrived at the Garden Bridge. The two looked out over the scenery of the Huangpu River. Then they turned back and intended to return home. Unexpectedly, at this time, a Westerner, E.M. Artis, residing at No. 885, Broadway Road, drove his private car, license No. 3787, from the north side of the bridge to the south at high speed. Zhang and Ms. Ma were walking in front of the car. They heard the sound of the car behind them and tried to avoid it, but it was too late. They were hit by the car and fell out for a great distance, and their heads were broken and bleeding. A nearby Indian patrol officer saw it and quickly impounded the car and took it to the police station for questioning. Zhang and Ms. Ma were sent to the Nursing Home and Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, Ms. Ma was only slightly injured and was discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Fellow Villagers Group Wedding, Rescheduled to New Year's Day</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese from Singapore, Wang Zhensheng, Invents Kerosene Engine Car, Can Use Singapore Kerosene Instead of Gasoline, Because It Is Cheaper, Many People Like to Use It</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, Mr. Wang Zhensheng, the owner of Wang Zhensheng Company in Singapore, has invented a kerosene engine car that uses Singapore kerosene instead of gasoline. This type of car has been running in various cities of Chaozhou Prefecture for the past two years, and many people are using it. Many cargo trucks and private cars in Singapore are also equipped with it. However, long-distance passenger cars were not equipped because the Bureau of Motor Vehicles had not yet approved it. Those in the industry hope for approval, as using a kerosene engine can also save costs. Recently, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has approved the installation of kerosene engines in long-distance passenger cars. As a result, car owners have been contacting Mr. Wang to switch to kerosene engines. Mr. Wang is now working day and night to rush production to meet the demand. According to recent news, Mr. Wang has also invented a new type of kerosene engine, which has faster speed and cleaner engine than the old type. It is the same as ordinary cars, and the magic lies in reducing fuel consumption. If the Singapore kerosene runs out on the way, it can be replaced by kerosene or gasoline.</p>

<h3>Tilden and Vines Decide to Come to Shanghai for a Second Performance - Returning from the Philippines on the 20th of This Month for Another Performance - Order Arranged, Welcome Amateur Players to Participate in Guidance</h3>
<p>The two world professional tennis giants, Tilden and Vines, passed through Shanghai the day before yesterday for a performance. Yesterday morning at 6:45, they took the original steamship, President Lincoln, south to Hong Kong, where they will have a performance competition, and then go to the Philippines for a performance. After finishing, they will take the original steamship back to the United States by the same route. It is expected that they will pass through Shanghai on the 20th of this month. The Pudda Trading Company in this city, which hosted the performance competition the day before yesterday, has already contacted the two and agreed that they will give another performance when they pass through Shanghai on the 20th, before returning to the United States.</p>
<p>Second Performance Order</p>
<p>After the performance the day before yesterday, Mr. Pymann, the manager of the Pudda Trading Company, immediately discussed the conditions for the second performance with Tilden at the International Hotel. The two parties fully agreed on the conditions, but the details are unknown. However, the general order of the performance has been roughly agreed upon. After Tilden and Vines have several performances with the Philippine professional tennis player Aragon in the Philippines, they will return to Shanghai by the same route. The order of the competition in Shanghai is expected to be two singles matches and one doubles match. Tilden will give a five-set singles performance match, and Vines will play a one-set singles match against Shanghai's best player, McGrath, and then Tilden and Vines will play doubles against Shanghai's one McGrath, or Cannavaro and one McGrath.</p>
<p>Welcome to Participate in Guidance Match</p>
<p>As for the "guidance" performance, amateur players of the first class in Shanghai are welcome to participate in this "guidance" performance. However, the consent of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association must be obtained first. Yamagishi, the Japanese Davis Cup player, had this so-called "guidance" performance against Vines in Japan this time. The ticket prices for the second performance on November 20 have been set at three types: five yuan, three yuan, and two yuan.</p>
<p>Tilden's Retirement Issue</p>
<p>Before Tilden and Vines left Shanghai, they were asked when Tilden would retire from his tennis career. Tilden replied that he suffered a slight injury to his arm during a performance in the United States this spring, and it has not yet fully recovered, but it is gradually improving. As for when he will retire, if he can still give a good performance to the audience, and the audience feels it is worth paying to watch, he will not retire. When he finds that he is regressing, he will retire immediately.</p>
<h3>National Sports Association - Full Board Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th Telegram - Hao Gengsheng went to Shanghai on the evening of the 7th to participate in the full board meeting of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation on the 8th, and to report on the situation of his trip to Europe to study sports. Hao said that the study report of the members of the sports study group to Europe has been drafted and sent to the Ministry, and is being sorted out separately to start drafting the general report. In addition to reporting the study situation in detail at this full board meeting of the Sports Association, he also plans to make suggestions to the Association on the areas for improvement in our country's sports based on the findings of the study and the opinions of the members, and submit them for discussion so that the government can adopt them. The scope of the recommendations is very broad and difficult to describe in detail for the time being. After the Sports Association has discussed them, there will be concrete decisions.</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 7th Telegram - Zhang Boling passed through Xuzhou from Tianjin at noon on the 7th to go to Shanghai. According to his talk, after attending the Sports Association meeting, he will go to Beijing and fly to Chongqing. The Nanyu Middle School, jointly established by Nankai in Sichuan, has already enrolled five new classes this semester and will continue to recruit female students next year. Funding will depend on assistance from all parties. All circles in Sichuan are willing to help. At a time of national crisis, the only way out is to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Tennis Match Concludes - Beijing Champion Ma Shaobo Loses to Cai Huiquan - Beijing Team Completely Defeated - Shanghai Wins 7-0</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai tennis competition was held yesterday morning and afternoon at the China Association court on Singapore Road. The strength of both sides was considerable, but as a result, the China Association took advantage of its home advantage and won a complete victory of seven to zero. In the performance matches, it won two and drew one. The Silver Ball Sword, a gift from the Director of the Beijing Social Bureau, was presented by Mrs. Zhao Henghai as a prize, and was accepted by Chen Qihao, the leader of the Chinese team. He hoped that the Beijing-Shanghai tennis friendship match could be held once a year in the spring and autumn seasons, so that they could learn from each other's mistakes and achieve unity. The battle situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Cai-Ma Battle - Among yesterday's group matches, the first singles match between Ma Shaobo and Cai Huiquan was the most noticed. Ma has recently become a champion in the capital and is indeed a rising star in Beijing. Cai recently participated in Wimbledon and returned. Yesterday's battle was quite exciting. Ma's hitting style is very stable and his strokes are powerful, but there is too little variation. Cai's hitting style is very good and his strategy is also correct. It is a pity that he does not have enough physical strength, otherwise he would be a formidable figure. In terms of strength, he should be above Ma. In the first set, Cai made many mistakes, and Ma won easily with a score of 6-1. However, from the second set onwards, Cai gradually improved. Although Ma took the lead with a score of 4-3, Cai won three consecutive games with extremely beautiful diagonal shots, taking back one set with a score of 6-4. In the third set, Cai became more and more brave and continued his long and short shots from left and right, taking the lead with scores of 3-1 and 5-2. At this time, Ma was exhausted from running and showed panic, and announced his surrender. The score was 6-3. The overall results are as follows.</p>
<p>Match Results (1) Cai Huiquan (Shanghai) defeated Ma Shaobo (Beijing) 1-6, 6-4, 6-3. (2) Zhou Guanjun (Shanghai) defeated Li Pizu (Beijing) 6-4, 7-5. (3) Luo Min (Shanghai) defeated Li Liejun (Beijing) 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. (4) Xu Demin (Shanghai) defeated Yang Renwei (Beijing) 8-6, 5-7, 8-6. (5) Chen Lanyuan (Shanghai) defeated Yu Zhizhong (Beijing) 6-2, 6-3. (6) Cai Huiquan and He Jialiu (Shanghai) defeated Ma Shaobo and Yu Zhizhong (Beijing) 6-4, 7-5. (7) Zhou Guanjun and Xu Demin (Shanghai) defeated Zhao Minheng and Yang Renwei (Beijing) 6-1, 6-1.</p>
<p>Performance Match Results (1) Zhao Minheng and Li Ruifu (Beijing) drew with Wang Qingshu and Wei Tinghua (Shanghai) 5-7, 8-6. (2) Li Baojun (Shanghai) defeated Zhang Shaoyue (Beijing) 6-2, 6-2. (3) Wang Shuqing and Chen Qihao (Shanghai) drew with Li Ruifu and Zhang Shaoyue (Beijing) 6-2, 5-7.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Western League A Group Football - Jinan Loses to Luxe - 5-1, 2-1 at Halftime</h3>
<p>The Jinan football team met Luxe yesterday at Shenyuan for the Western League A Group match. Luxe is one of the top four teams this season, and the outcome was already expected. However, Jinan played hard yesterday, and Luxe did not look very energetic, so the match ended with a score of 9-1. Luxe won, with a score of 2-1 at halftime. The audience was very small, about 300 people. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Ye Peichu</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxiang Guan Zhiyang</p>
<p>Liu Shizan Yan Lianjin Zhang Riyuan</p>
<p>Zeng Rongzhong Cai Jincai Shi Yongnan Wu Shufen Chen Nianjin</p>
<p>Luxe</p>
<p>Eckhoff</p>
<p>Niu Bao Lugeng</p>
<p>Lieqin Hage</p>
<p>Liaosun Tuo</p>
<p>Lei Ying Gelinbo Bolingying Pei Keke Leng Adige</p>
<p>First Half - Luxe attacked first. Within eight minutes, both sides had shots that hit the post. Soon after, Luxe advanced from the left, Gelinbo raised his foot and passed to the right, and Keke Leng scored with one kick, registering first. Jinan launched a major counterattack, but failed to score. Soon after, Jinan encountered two more dangerous situations, both of which were saved by Ye Peichu. The Luxe army took advantage of the situation to attack, reaching the gate. Gelinbo flew and shot low, entering from the left corner. Luxe took the lead with a score of 2-1. At this time, about three minutes before the break, Jinan's offensive turned strong. Chen Nianjin hooked from the baseline, swept through the ball fight, and Eckhoff missed his foot. No one was in front of the goal, and Zeng Rongzhong was too late to catch up. The shot was caught. At this time, the ball was not far out and turned to the right. Liu Shizan hooked back to the center line, and Wu Shufen shot fiercely at the penalty line. The shoe and the ball flew together, cutting into the net and breaking the duck egg record, making the score 2-1. Two minutes later, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Second Half - The battle started again. Three minutes into the half, the Luxe army launched a fierce attack. Adige hooked from the baseline, and the ball fell beside the left post of the goal, less than a foot away. Yan Lianjin and Bolingai competed for the ball, hooking and picking with their knees. Unexpectedly, Yan turned cleverness into clumsiness and sent a gift, making the score 3-1. Jinan lost many good opportunities and has since been depressed. After 20 minutes, neither side had made any achievements. After a long time, Qinxun, a veteran of Luxe, got a chance at the door and opened the record again. Not even a minute later, Lei Ying got a pass from Kokelan and headed the ball into the net, making the score 5-1. Because of Luxe's excessive bravery, Gelinbo and Keke Leng were successively injured and left the field. Soon after, the game ended, and Jinan lost 5-1.</p>

<h3>Western League Football Group A Recent Status</h3>
<h3>Fashang General Association Hard Court Tennis - Li Pizu Overwhelms Sun Linfang - Continues Today</h3>
<p>The Fashang Hard Court Tennis continued to start yesterday. Related to Chinese people, there are four groups of doubles and one group of singles. Mr. Li Pizu, a famous player from Beijing, participated in the Beijing-Shanghai vs. Hangzhou match of the Chinese Tennis Association yesterday morning, and had to attend both singles and doubles in the afternoon. At 1:30 PM, he first competed against Mr. Sun Qifang, the pillar of the Xianfang Cup in this city, in singles. The two sides were equally matched in skill, but Mr. Li was more experienced in the arena, so he won straight sets. At 3:30 PM, Mr. Li teamed up with Mr. Yang Renwei from Beijing to play a doubles match against Ma Anquan and Zhou Guanjun. Zhou and Ma are also first-class players in this city, and they were in better shape due to being well-rested, so they won the final victory and eliminated Li and Yang. However, the scores were very close, 6-4, 8-6. In another doubles group, Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang, student athletes from this city, played against Kelasha and Cannavaro. Kelasha is known for his tenacity, and Ka is the son of professional tennis player Cannavaro, with a deep family education. However, Hu and Li's skills have improved exceptionally fiercely this year. With a big knife and axe, they broke through the gates straight in. As expected, success came naturally. Finally, they eliminated Keka with a score of 6-4, 9-7. Another match, Chen Yi and Bu De, defeated Forbes and Mermen with seemingly no effort. Mr. Wu Shenmin, who cooperated with Ning Fei, is a promising newcomer. Unfortunately, he was miserably defeated by Kuan Leng and Turner yesterday. The second set was fought to 22 points to determine the winner. It will continue today, starting at 10:30 AM. The men's singles will start the third week, with Li Pizu facing Li Guofan, and Shen Meizhen facing Shi Guiya. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>The Reflections We Should Have After the World Games</h3>
<p>— Shao Rugan</p>
<p>The Eleventh World Games, which attracted worldwide attention, have been over for a long time. Recalling the German preparations’ comprehensiveness, the venue layout's novelty, the audience’s enthusiasm, the order’s excellence, and the breakthrough of various sports records at the Games, this great historical achievement is so worthy of praise and commemoration. Military songs and cheers echoed, the flags of the meeting and national flags waved together, and hundreds of thousands of people gathered, showing the popularity of various races. The unprecedented grand occasion was deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience, and no one can forget it, only recall it with longing, remember it forever, and think of it forever. Since Hitler took office in Germany, it has been known as the Third Reich. National rejuvenation and national strength are praised by everyone. This conference was held in Berlin. All kinds of construction and organizations all showed the spirit of a dazzling new country, burying themselves in hard work, and painstakingly researching, which is really admirable. The construction of various parts of the venue required more than 30 million. Fifty-two countries participated. There were more than 5,000 male and female athletes, and more than 100,000 people attended the sports performances and youth training personnel from various countries. The Games had 1,200 referees, 1,200 assistant referees, 400 office staff, and more than 12,000 others assisting with the Games' affairs, such as transportation and telecommunications.</p>
<p>This conference not only displayed the spirit of sports competitions to observe the sports technology achievements of athletes from various countries, but also had sports performances from various countries and grand gatherings, such as sports exhibitions and art and science exhibitions, one to display the spirit of the World Games, and one to display the spirit of German revival. The leisure and entertainment discussion held in Hamburg, the international sports camp in Aus, and the large group callisthenics performance of thousands of male and female children and young people, the entire conference, in addition to paying attention to sports competitions, can also take into account the discussion and lectures on sports theory. This is something that previous World Games have not been able to do. The bell of the Berlin Olympics welcomed athletes from various countries back to their motherland, and the technology and spirit of the conference will continue to be promoted. The meeting song and meeting emblem will be kept forever. In 1940, this kind of human race sports performance will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Learning from the past and planning for the future, how should we hone and strive to make full preparations?</p>
<p>Our country participated in the World Games this time, with a delegation of 141 people. The grand organization, European figures and the people of Berlin paid great attention to our sports. The athletes' representatives participated in various sports and did their best. However, their physique was inferior to others, and their energy was inferior to others, so that the sports competition lagged behind in every aspect and failed everywhere. In the international martial arts arena, we could not hold our heads high and raise our eyebrows. The flagpoles on the scoreboard could not display our national flag. Now, let's not complain about fate, but blame the weakness of the Chinese race.</p>
<p>In the cold wind and bitter rain, our delegation left Berlin and returned to Shanghai on October 3rd. As defeated generals and a humiliating army, we were ridiculed and mocked. What else can we say? How can we bear to say it? It is often said that it is easy to be an athlete's representative, but it is difficult to be an athlete's representative of a country that has no international achievements. Victory is gratifying, but defeat is difficult to show to others. These words are not only for the athletes who attended the World Games in our country this time. Perhaps what the athletes want to say in their hearts is, alas, their ambitions have not been realized, and their hearts are depressed. Where else can they complain?</p>
<p>However, the fact of failure is after all before our eyes. Sarcasm and sneers are good lessons after failure. We must find a way to win in failure in order to wash away the shame of failure.</p>
<p>Over the long years, the delegation has returned to China for more than a month. How to strive for progress, I think the sports authorities are designing and preparing. Now, let's first put forward the important issues after the World Games for discussion.</p>
<p>(1) There Must Be a Sound Sports Administrative Organization</p>
<p>The sports administrative organization is the backbone of all sports undertakings. Tracing its evolutionary process, it mostly tends to political organization. Use the government's greatest determination and the power of politics to determine a precise and sound sports administrative organization as a driving force. Concentrate thinking, unify steps, and let the government allocate annual business expenses and work hard, then the sports undertakings of our Chinese nation may have hope of progress. At present, the highest sports administrative organizations in our country are the Sports Department and the National Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education, which handle national school sports, social sports, and scout and military training affairs. The Central Civil Training Department has a Sports Guidance Section and the National Sports Planning Committee, which handle the sports guidance affairs of party departments and mass organizations at all levels. The Training Headquarters also has a Sports Section to pay attention to the promotion of military sports undertakings. Different paths lead to the same goal, guiding and developing their respective sports undertakings. However, the administrative organization is slightly different. In fact, in promoting undertakings, it is inevitable that there will be a situation of duplication of efforts. There are few opportunities for communication, which loses the power of lotus connection and progress. We must refer to the trends of sports administration in various countries and adapt to the urgent needs of our Chinese nation to build a sports administrative organization of the era. On the 7th of last month, the first National Sports Design Committee meeting of the Central Civil Training Department had a suggestion on the central sports administrative group to concentrate and merge the above three parts and organize it under the control of the national supreme leader. The general idea of this case is to hand it over for review. If it can be realized, then the matters of sports should be promoted and reformed in our country will definitely be effective. Under the supervision and guidance of the central government, complete the provincial and municipal sports administrative groups in the shortest possible time, then all promotion undertakings will easily achieve the effect of pointing arms.</p>
<p>(2) School Sports</p>
<p>After the content of sports courses in schools at all levels and the key points of homework for each academic year are promulgated by the Ministry of Education, there are many who comply with and strictly implement them, but there are also those who perfunctorily follow the old ways. In terms of universities, it is not appropriate to give up and let them be free. We should strictly popularize sports. For freshmen and sophomores, at least two hours of sports per week should be required courses. High school and junior high school should follow the ministry's orders. Military training and scout training time should not encroach on the original sports time. Extracurricular activities and outdoor life should be actively promoted. The content of elementary school sports courses needs to be improved. The key points of homework for each academic year should be detailed, and sports standards must be formulated to cultivate the virtues of hard work, endurance, courage, obedience, liveliness, and happiness. Standard tests should be tried out. Those who cannot meet the standards should not be promoted or graduated. In addition, youth training and youth labor service should also be vigorously promoted as the basis for protecting the country and strengthening the race.</p>
<p>(3) Social Sports</p>
<p>Europeans and Americans have developed sports habits, and their interest in sports is strong. Children, young people, and all walks of life in society have sports habits, and talents emerge in large numbers. There is a reason for this. In our country, sports seem to be occupied by school students. The public rarely consults them. Therefore, social sports are also the most difficult thing to do effectively. How to create a strong sports atmosphere is the first problem to promote mass sports. Sports practitioners must go deep into the people, approach the people, and welcome the people to the venue to exercise. At the same time, they should investigate the local material environment, distribute and set up small-scale sports venues, hold sports competitions, and sports performances. Regarding folk sports, they should also be promoted more so that the sports venue becomes a center for promoting sports undertakings and a central agency for the implementation of mass education, so that the public recognizes the important significance of sports and gradually develops their love of sports. I think that the mass sports undertakings that are completely unpredictable will eventually reach the day we seek. Dear compatriots, our physique is not enough to compete with Europeans and Americans. At the Asian Games in Tokyo in the future, can our Chinese nation hold its head high and breathe easily? It all depends on preparing early and preparing quickly. (End)</p>

<h3>The Municipal No. 1 Sports Field: Chess Competition Held</h3>
<p>Due to the needs of those who come to the Municipal No. 1 Sports Field for exercise, a chess competition will be held. The competition will be held every evening. Registration will start on the 9th of this month and end on the 23rd. The origin of the competition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The field previously thought that athletes should have proper entertainment during rest to adjust themselves. Otherwise, people living together without anything to do easily talk about things that are not righteous. Therefore, chess was specially set up for leisure after exercise.</p>
<p>A chess game requires a calm attitude, meticulous thinking, and perseverance. These qualities are complementary and not contradictory to the edification of various sports. Therefore, it is quite popular among athletes.</p>
<p>Over the years, the number of people who love it has increased, and the interest has become stronger. Recently, more people have requested to hold a competition to achieve the effect of observation and mutual learning. This is the reason for the birth of this chess competition. The competition time is after 7:00 pm every evening, which does not hinder the work, practice, and sports of all walks of life. The main point is to use the spirit of the New Life Movement to eliminate the bad habits of chess playing in the past. It is also hoped that it will be recognized by those who know.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Price of Yarn Fell Sharply in the Morning; The Market Relied on Strong Spot Sales and Rebounded by 1.5-1.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the trend was slightly calmer. However, most people generally believe that the price of yarn will rise. Therefore, it rebounded as soon as it fell. In the spot yarn transaction, the Guangdong gang in the south was still buying strongly, and coarse yarn accounted for the majority. The initial price of standard yarn was because someone released 6,000 bales in the near future, breaking through the 30 yuan mark this month. It gradually recovered in the afternoon. However, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was flat.</p>
<p>Major Investors Have Been Very Active in Recent Months</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard yarn market, the near month market turned downward due to the too rapid rise of the previous day, and the Tianjin gang took profits. The far month market followed suit. Gengfeng and Hexing bulls released a large number of orders. However, the market atmosphere was unanimously bullish, and major investors have been very active in recent months. However, the price of 233 yuan was higher than the head of the spot yarn price, and some bulls closed out, and the platform was slightly loose and fell step by step. As a result, the near month of standard yarn fell 3.5 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the far month fell 1-1.5 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the near month was strong, and the second round turned flat. By the time of the third closing, it was heard that there was still 1,000 bales of spot yarn transactions, and the near month market rebounded again. As a result, the near month market rose 1.5-1.6 yuan compared with the morning closing price, and the far month rose 4-5 cents. It was found that Dafu sold 1,700 bales, Hexing 4,250 bales, Minghua 1,050 bales, Qingfeng 4,200 bales, Senkang 3,250 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, Dachang 1,450 bales, Changyu 850 bales, Ruidai 700 bales, and Zhenda 600 bales.

The daily market comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Transactions Reached More Than 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total purchase by various gangs throughout the day was 1,341 bales, and the selling price was flat. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 660</p>
<p>Inland 10</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 45</p>
<p>Shantou 75</p>

<h3>Cotton Futures Are Not as Strong as Yarn Futures Due to the Abundant Supply of Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weakly because there is a constant stream of goods arriving from the North, with 20,000 to 30,000 dan arriving in Shanghai every day. Therefore, people's hearts are discouraged, but various parties have not taken any action. The overseas cotton industry is in poor condition. The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute estimates that the national cotton production this year will be 12,131,000 shi dan.</p>
<p>Goods From the North Arrive Continuously</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard cotton market, the market was loose due to the continuous decline in overseas cotton markets and the congestion of sources from various routes. There were 20,000 to 30,000 dan of cotton arriving in Shanghai from the North every day. Therefore, buyers were lacking, and the market was loose. However, some parties were tightening up because the yarn market was strong and high. As a result, each month fell by 4-5 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was ordinary. The number of people going long decreased due to the abundant cotton production. The second round slightly rallied, and the third round was flat. As a result, each month fell by another 5 cents compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Hexing sold 8,900 dan, Dafu 1,200 dan, Yudai 4,200 dan, Gengfeng 6,700 dan, Xingchang 1,700 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Changhe 4,000 dan, Sentai 1,900 dan, Dachangcheng 3,700 dan, and Runkang 1,400 dan. Yuandai bought 2,300 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Mingde 3,900 dan, Xingchang 1,900 dan, Yichang 1,000 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Shengyuan 2,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,200 dan, and Changji 2,300 dan. The daily market prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Sales Are Still Not Weak</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, but the intake of each factory has not seen a significant increase. The sources are Yao cotton 1,118 bales, and Tong cotton 1,100 bales.</p>
<p>Cizhou Cotton 58.5 Gongan Factory Intake 189 Pieces Spot Goods Sent to the Factory</p>

<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 48.50 Dong Hang Intake 38 Pieces Spot Goods Delivered at the Warehouse</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Have All Fallen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US discount opened, and the market was sluggish. Each month rose or fell by 2 pounds. The Liverpool news was unfavorable, but it was overturned by the purchase of the same industry and foreign merchants. Then, the price turned weak due to the closing out of long positions, cotton farmers hedging, and rumors that the US Cotton Cooperative estimated that the new cotton reached 12.3 million bales. The demand outside the industry was flat, and most of the industry waited for the government's estimate. Later, the same industry continued to buy the December contract. At the same time, the demand for cloth was active, and the selling sentiment gradually weakened. The market price was able to stand firm. At the close, hedging and closing out of long positions were seen again, and the price fell again. It is estimated that the spot price fell by 7 pounds, and the futures price fell by 4-9 pounds. English cotton spot price fell by 2 points, and futures price fell by 3-4 points. Indian cotton short positions were sold, and European exporters bought in. It is estimated that Pingguor fell by 0.25-0.75 rupees, Omra fell by 0.75-1 rupees, and Bailuo Public fell by half a rupee. Original (6th report)</p>
<p>Pingguolan 158.10 Fell 0.75 28.00</p>
<p>March Contract 159.25 0.25 18.10</p>
<p>Omra 196.25 1.00 34.70</p>
<p>March Contract 196.00 0.75 34.70</p>
<p>Bailuoxi 395.0 0.50 38.90</p>
<p>According to Mumbai electricity, the opening forecast on the 7th, Bailuoxi was 218.5 rupees, down 1 rupee, Omra was 195 rupees, down 1.25 rupees, and Pingguor was 158 rupees, down half a rupee.</p>
<p>Osaka electricity on the 7th, the three-grade yarn futures rose by 2 cents to fall by 4 cents, the near month was 224.6 yuan, and the far month was 207.9 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 1.5 cents to rise by 1.5 cents, the near month was 65.7 yuan, and the far month was 66.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Weekend Statistics of US and Egyptian Cotton</h3>
<p>US Cotton (Unit: Thousand Bales)</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton (Unit: Thousand Kangtai)</p>
<h3>Statistics of Cotton Purchases by Chinese and Japanese Yarn Factories in October - Inventory Increased Significantly</h3>
<p>According to a survey by a cotton industry organization, the total amount of raw cotton purchased and used by Shanghai factories in October was 82,476 bales, a decrease of 10,361 bales from the previous month. Among them, the amount purchased by Japanese factories was 40,171 bales, an increase of 9,032 bales from the previous month, and the amount purchased by Chinese factories was 42,305 bales, a decrease of 19,393 bales from the previous month. The amount of cotton purchased by Chinese and Japanese factories is listed below.</p>
<p>According to the survey on November 6, the cotton inventory is as follows.</p>
<h3>Textile Goods: Native Cotton Cloth Factory Market Prices Repeatedly Increase</h3>
<p>Although the overseas cotton market has continuously declined and the exchange's yarn prices have repeatedly fallen, the price of native cotton cloth has increased because Japanese trading companies have raised prices for fine cloth, No. 84 cloth, and market cloth for December delivery by five cents per bolt again today. Over the past few days, the total increase has been ten to twenty cents per bolt, leading to increased buying interest in the market. Because of the continuous downward trend in the market in recent days, factories and traders have generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Now, they are rushing to replenish their stocks, and demand is high, so the market has turned around. Therefore, although yarn and cotton prices fell today, cloth prices continue to rise. Fine cloth, suitable for dyeing blue, is in urgent demand due to the current season. The base price of No. 84 cloth and market cloth is still low, and demand is expected to increase gradually in the future. Therefore, the price increase has exceeded ten to fifteen cents per bolt. The base price of fine twill is already high, and it has also increased by five cents per bolt. However, sales of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and colored cloth, straight tribute cloth, serge, woolen cloth, flannel, and white flannel remain sluggish, and a turnaround is unlikely. Transactions are mainly with local stores and traders. Sales to some customers from Tianjin, Changsha, Hankou, and Guangzhou in the north and south are slightly better, but most customers are still reluctant to purchase new, expensive goods because cheap goods are still difficult to sell locally.</p>
<h3>Long-haired Camel Down Still Popular: Used by the Bourgeoisie, Sixty Yuan Is Not Expensive</h3>
<p>The new silk-woven long-haired camel down that was popular the year before last is still popular now. Generally, the upper class or bourgeoisie choose this material for men's and women's overcoats. A typical long-haired camel down overcoat costs an average of over sixty yuan in national currency, and a slightly better one costs no less than one hundred yuan, because the wholesale market price is more than ten yuan per yard, and higher quality ones are more than twenty yuan. Fabric stores all have orders. N绒 numbers on Qipan Street do not sell it, but Ruishiwen, Shili Luo and other foreign companies all have stock and sales are very active.</p>
<h3>Finance: Bullion Sellers Gradually Feeling the Pressure, Settlement Price Increases by $1.40</h3>
<p>The gold market rose again yesterday due to the rise in pure gold prices, and the settlement price was even higher, which boosted confidence and turned the market firm. However, it was somewhat weak in the middle of the day due to the influence of the exchange rate market, but the final result was still stable. In the early morning, it was said that the overseas silver market showed a rise in London and no change in the U.S. market. Traders said that after the market closed, India bought in, and a few sellers needed to add 0.625, so the market was stable. The forward silver price in Mumbai rose by one to two li. Exchange rates shrank. London spot gold rose by three and a half pence. The central bank announced its exchange rates, which showed no change in the UK and the US, and the customs gold unit rose by four li. The standard gold price was listed at 1159.1 yuan. In after-hours trading, the opening price was 53 yuan. Hengyu sold up to about 2.5 yuan, Qiaofeng and Yongjin up to more than 2 yuan, and Fuxing and Yongheng sold and retreated to 1.6 yuan. The morning opened high, but after the opening, major bulls continued to close out positions and gradually fell. Major investors also increased their positions on dips, which helped maintain the market. HSBC announced its exchange rates, which showed no change in the UK and the US. At this time, supply and demand were uneven, but because Chinese merchants were actively buying foreign exchange, market sentiment was not good, leading to multiple declines. Later, due to the efforts of Qiaofeng, Yongjin, etc., the supply side gradually felt exhausted, and the silver balance tax also increased by 1.25 cents, allowing the market to move upward. However, bears took advantage of the high prices to increase their positions, and the market fluctuated again at noon. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1152.9 yuan, up 1.4 yuan from the previous close. Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongyi, Dahengchang, and Yongtuo sold off to 2.2 yuan.

The registration price for this month was 1150 yuan, the price for December was 1153 yuan, and the spot price in the morning was 1150 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were quoted at 12 yuan higher, the buying price for cooked red gold was 9 yuan higher, and the selling price was 12.5 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. The same was true for swaps.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Qiaofeng, Yongcheng, Dacheng, Tongtaichang, Tongfu, Jiuda, Huiyuan, and Dachangxiang were on the buying side, while Hengchang, Yongda, Decheng, Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuanyong, Yidawanxing, Hengyu, Shengyuanyong, and Yuanmao were on the selling side.</p>
<p>The market situation for the first half of the day was stable. The morning opened at 1152.9 yuan and closed at 1152.9 yuan at noon. The highest was 1153.3 yuan, and the lowest was 1152.2 yuan, a fluctuation of 1.1 yuan. As a result, it rose by 1.4 yuan from the previous close. The total number of transactions in the first half of the day was 1,246 bars.</p>

<h3>South China Continues to Sell US Dollars: Exchange Rate Shrinks But Process Remains Flat</h3>
<p>Although the exchange rate market shrank yesterday, it remained flat due to continued selling by Chinese merchants. In the early morning, overseas telegraphs showed that both near-term and forward rates in London rose by 1.25. Traders said that after the market closed, the Indian buyer side was limited, and sellers needed to add 0.0625, so the market was stable. The New York silver market was unchanged. The forward silver price in Mumbai rose by one to four li. London spot gold rose by three and a half pence. The British pound against the US dollar shrank by 0.875, the British pound against the French franc fell by 18 points, the US dollar against the British pound shrank by 0.625, the US dollar against the French franc rose by 0.5 points. The central bank announced its exchange rates, which showed no change in the UK and the US. The customs gold unit rose by four li. The exchange rate market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for the British pound at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 53125, and the US dollar at 29.5625 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the British pound and the US dollar averaged out. After the opening, banks were unevenly buying and selling, leading to multiple declines. HSBC announced its exchange rates, which showed no change in the UK and the US. Later, Chinese merchants continued to close out long positions in US dollars. Although the silver balance tax rose by 1.25 cents, it was difficult to boost the market. Fortunately, banks made efforts to buy, which provided support, and the process was still flat. The final trend was fluctuating, mainly due to the appearance of cash on the Shanghai market. The near-term closing price at noon was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 53215 for the British pound and 29.5625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous close, both the British pound and the US dollar were flat. The same was true for forward rates. Chinese merchants sold about 200,000 US dollars. Japanese banks bought and sold US dollars, and banks were still accepting. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Fell Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated slightly. Because there are still many changes in the current situation, optimism is not warranted. The situation in eastern Suiyuan is extremely tense. There are also rumors in the market about the issuance of new government bonds, which makes people more nervous. However, a group of bulls still insist very strongly and have no intention of giving up for the time being. Therefore, the future market price may still not be able to escape the path of fluctuation. The process yesterday was that at the beginning of the opening, most of the buying was for the current month's Ding types No. 4 and No. 53, while the selling was relatively strong. Therefore, the market price changed from strong to weak. After that, Nos. 5, 10, 40, and 47 all sold off, and the market price gradually declined, with the largest decline in the second type of forward contracts by a small margin of 0.4 yuan. In the second round, the Ding type also fell, and Nos. 16 and 32 also sold off. The market price fell again by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. After the afternoon opening, selling was less sparse. Retail investors slightly covered their short positions, and there were swap transactions. The market situation became uncertain again, with both highs and lows, amounting to 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The closing price was due to Saturday, and temporary short positions on the table were largely covered. Only the near-term Jia type still had a small profit due to swap transactions, and the rest were uniformly slightly better by about 0.1 yuan. As a result, the market price recovered by a small margin of 0.15 to 0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was 7,990,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grains: Spot Wheat Remains High, and Forward Flour Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market prices for various months showed an initial flat and then rising trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada remained slightly lower. The drought in some parts of the country seemed to have been generally relieved with rain, so market sentiment was very flat at the time of opening. The price for the current month was as low as 2.67 yuan, down 0.025 yuan from the previous day. The initial opening of forward contracts was also weak, but because the factory did not hedge, and outsiders still expected higher prices due to the high price of spot wheat, the asking price stabilized again, up 0.01 yuan from the initial price. When the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment for near-term and forward contracts turned firm again. The near-term contracts immediately rose by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan due to customer withdrawals. Outsiders continued to absorb forward contracts. The factory code did not continue to be released, so market sentiment became speculative, and it continued to rise by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. Various months rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the initial opening. After that, the market sentiment can only be calmed when the quoted price is close.</p>
<h3>Source Gradually Dries Up: Forward Wheat Difficult to Fall Flat: Yesterday Rebounded by Six or Seven Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning, the market prices for various months were initially flat and quiet. Because foreign wheat was slightly lower and the early regions had received rain, market sentiment naturally eased, so the opening price was flat and weak. However, by the close, because the flour market was weak but recovered, market sentiment was also driven up, rising by 0.01, 0.03, or 0.04 yuan compared to the initial opening. When the market opened in the afternoon, the buying interest was strong, and the opening price for the current month was 0.05 or 0.06 yuan higher, so the forward contracts also became smart. The recent market situation fluctuates frequently, with large swings, mainly because wheat has fallen, the source is gradually drying up, and market sentiment is not easy to decline. The spot wheat market seems to be slightly lower by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan on the surface, but it is still unwilling to loosen up. The high-quality goods opened at 6.04 yuan, the second quality goods opened at 0.02 yuan lower, and the medium quality goods were lowered accordingly, with only more than 3,000 bags opened.</p>
<h3>Evening Market of Ke Xian Rebounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued to arrive in Shanghai from various ports along the Yangtze River, but the market was even weaker and dull due to the suspension of business by Ke gangs the day before. At the opening in the morning, the high-quality goods seemed to continue to decline. Later, the Henan gang took advantage of the smooth sales to purchase more than 2,000 bags of early and late rice, and this was important for market support and the market price was still able to maintain. In the afternoon, the Guangdong gang continued to purchase 3,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi brown rice, and the market was able to stabilize. A total of 6,440 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,254 bags of Shantou rice, and more than 300 bags of Yongbo rice were opened for the whole day, and there were few other inputs and outputs.</p>

<h3>Bo Dao Sales in the North Are Worse Than Before: Due to Lack of Ship Spaces</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various gangs totaled more than 40, with a total of more than 8,000 shi. The sales market in this street is still acceptable, and the Tianjin gang handled 1,200 to 1,300 bags of new Japonica rice, so the market price rose by 0.07 or 0.08 yuan. Although gangs such as Qingdao and Yantai continued to handle Bo Dao, it seemed worse than before due to the lack of ship spaces for transportation, with a total of more than 3,000 bags going. Therefore, the opening price did not change much. The Wei Xiang of Dujian goods rose by about 0.1 yuan. The high-quality materials of foreign Jian goods were also a bit tight. The arrival of new Yin Yuan goods was limited, and the catering service also handled it, so the price suddenly increased by more than 0.2 yuan. The new Bian Yuan has no distinction.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 42 or 43 numbers of sources from various places downstream of the river, and various market outlets turned sluggish again. The new japonica was weak, and the Bo Dao customers were weakly receptive. This street was also sluggish, and the price fell by several points. Yangbu and Dujian were both 0.03 or 0.04 yuan lower. Bian Yuan continued to be handled by the winery, and retail sales were still acceptable. The price was tightly pegged at 0.03 or 0.05 yuan. Yin Yuan was scarce, and the situation was strong. The arrival of early rice was sparse, and the price was firm. The customer Jian transaction and the market shape was flat.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Price Rose by 20 Yuan Yesterday: But Silk Merchants Still Have No Intention to Sell</h3>
<p>The prices of silk in the United States and Japan have risen continuously. The opening price on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan for both near-term and forward contracts. Only Japanese and Chinese silk prices remained stable. Yokohama silk prices jumped by 7 to 10 yuan. The prices in Lyon also rose by half a franc. The market sentiment was quite good, and the market sentiment in this port was quite strong. United States Zhuang purchased up to 300 packages yesterday. The selling price rose by 10 to 20 yuan. Silk merchants with bullish prices still firmly had no intention of selling. Looking at the entire market, if the prices in Japan and the United States continue to stabilize, there is more hope in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Silk and Tea Transactions Are Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, Zhenmei green tea from Lailu Zhuang was continuously handled by British Zhuang, Yih和 and Long等行, and the transaction was still active. The total transaction volume in the city was more than 400 boxes. The top price opened at 51 yuan, which was not much higher or lower than the previous few days. Yingyin and other banks also have some sporadic purchases of Zhenmei and Gongxi, but sales to Russia have not moved, and the market price is difficult to increase.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Wufu White Ice Will Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be flat and soft. At the opening of the guild, the original prices were called for Nos. 24 coarse white and Nos. 489 Dongbai, the local factory and cotton white, etc. There were also few shipments of numbered goods. It is reported that the news from the standard No. 5 Fu Binghao has passed the second batch, and the telegrams have been loaded and are on the way. It will arrive approximately tomorrow, and the price of the number plate will be raised by 0.1 yuan, or it may be traded.</p>

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Toys</h3>
<p>— Yiyiguan Lord</p>
<p>I recently saw the Tianjin telegraph news published in this newspaper saying: "According to a customs survey, from January to September of this year, the total value of Japanese toys imported into North China was 5 million yuan, an increase of 35% compared to last year."</p>
<p>After reading the above telegraph news, I feel that "toys" are originally the gift of children. It can also be said that all children love "toys." This is not only true for the children in our country, but also for the children in your noble country. Then, we welcome other people's "toys," as long as we have "toys," other people will also come to welcome them. What is so rare about the mere "5 million yuan"?</p>
<p>However, what is terrible is that other people's "toys" can deceive our money. And our "toys" cannot only deceive other people's money. On the contrary, they are used by others as a kind of aggressive "toy"!</p>
<p>Alas! Someone asked me: What kind of "toy" is this? Is it a dog? Is it a pig? I said: This is a kind of "toy" that is similar to that, that is, those "traitors" and puppets!</p>
<h3>Casual Talks About Children's Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yisheng</p>
<p>Xiao Wu Changed Crying</p>
<p>When Emperor Jianwen collapsed, Emperor Xiaowu ascended the throne. At that time, he was only a little over ten years old. According to the imperial rules, when the old emperor died and a new emperor took over, the young emperor had to go to the spirit tablet every evening to cry, which was called "crying." However, Emperor Xiaowu did not go to cry very often. The people around him thought that he was too young to understand the rules, so they explained it to him and asked him to abide by the rules and go to cry every day. Emperor Xiaowu said: "I will naturally cry when I feel sad. How can I force myself to do this crying thing every day?" He still "went his own way" and only went to the spirit tablet when he really wanted to cry, and did not hold a crying ceremony on time.</p>
<p>Etiquette was originally created based on human sentiment. However, worldly etiquette is practiced too rigidly and becomes hypocritical, which is even more comical! But look at the funeral ceremonies held in ordinary people's homes now: when the mourner walks to the spirit tablet, the master of ceremonies shouts loudly, and the crying sound in the filial mourning immediately follows, a loud wailing and unrestrained excitement, called holding a funeral; when the master of ceremonies finishes shouting, the crying sound will also quickly disappear. Such a cycle of ups and downs forms a law, can't the master of ceremonies be called the "crying commander"? There are many other ridiculous etiquettes that are too numerous to mention. They should be reformed according to the situation, and there is no need to adhere to them rigidly. Xiaowu criticized that corrupt etiquette and resolutely went his own way, which was purely out of the innocence of a child; in that medieval era of worshiping etiquette, being in the imperial position as a model for subjects, this kind of behavior was not easy to obtain! Today, people do not need to be rigid and against their feelings about etiquette, nor do they need to overcorrect or even completely abolish them. They only need to recognize the rationale and act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Manure</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>"Ten Thousand Taels of Gold" someone calls it that! Although manure is a stinky thing that makes people fearful, it can be used as fertilizer to help rice seedlings grow out of golden rice, which is evidence of its contribution to people!</p>
<p>The food we send into our mouths is first secreted by saliva in the oral cavity to turn starch into soluble sugar: gastric juice is secreted in the stomach to digest protein; the bile and pancreatic juice remaining in the intestine can also digest fat, and the digested food is then sent to the cells in all parts of the body through the intestinal membrane and blood vessels, but the substances that cannot be absorbed in the intestine become manure! It is excreted from the excretory cavity!</p>
<p>Speaking of manure, it also has many ingredients:</p>
<p>(1) Undigested food residue (such as fat, protein, and carbohydrates)</p>
<p>(2) Indigestible substances (such as fiber, chlorophyll, etc.)</p>
<p>(3) Difficult-to-digest substances (such as raw starch, pity acid salts, etc.)</p>
<p>(4) Various bacteria and dead cells of the intestinal mucosa</p>
<p>(5) Bile residue</p>
<p>From manure, we can create many plant-based foods, which is the so-called "taking from people" and then "using it for people," and the cycle continues!</p>
<p>Children, don't underestimate manure! Although it is a stinky thing!</p>
<h3>Spinning Girl</h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Spinning Girl,</p>
<p>Wailing and crying;</p>
<p>The sound of spinning all night,</p>
<p>Both lifelike and wonderful;</p>
<p>Seemingly sympathizing with Gandhi's non-cooperation,</p>
<p>Calling for the restoration of national economic freedom;</p>
<p>The spinning wheel is his constant companion,</p>
<p>Spinning the wheel is his daily work;</p>
<p>A cry to promote domestic goods,</p>
<p>This singing and that harmony is really lively;</p>
<p>Until late autumn,</p>
<p>Early autumn leaves and west wind;</p>
<p>They all disappear without a trace,</p>
<p>But there is not a single strand or thread to be used as cold clothes;</p>
<p>When things come to a head,</p>
<p>I can't save myself even if I want to save myself,</p>
<p>The root of this disease is that I can only talk but can't act,</p>
<p>Only caring about singing empty slogans;</p>
<p>Don't sing empty slogans!</p>
<p>Don't sing empty slogans!</p>
<p>It is better to do everything down-to-earth.</p>
<h3>Small Discussion</h3>
<p>— Yongren</p>
<p>It was getting dark.</p>
<p>Zhi'er and De'er were sitting in the courtyard, telling stories to pass the time. Suddenly, a bat flew very low and passed over De'er's head. This swoop seemed to start De'er's doubts: he immediately asked Zhi'er:</p>
<p>"Brother! Some people say that this bat is a bird, and some people say that it is a beast. Which category do you think it belongs to?"</p>
<p>"Guess what! What exactly is it?" Zhi'er asked De'er back with a smile.</p>
<p>"I said that the bat is a bird," De'er said firmly.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"It has wings to fly, isn't that proof that it is a bird?"</p>
<p>"Well, you are wrong! What it uses to fly is not wings. It's just that its front toes are very long, and the skin is stretched between the toes to connect them, so it looks like wings.</p>
<p>The bat does not have the sharp beak of a bird, but the lips and teeth of a beast; what covers its body is not feathers but fur; it has very long ears; and it does not lay eggs, so at first glance, the shape of the bat seems to be a bird, but in fact it is a beast!"</p>
<h3>Do you believe that there is carbon in sugar?</h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>The sweet white sugar that we eat every day actually contains a lot of carbon. This sentence seems a bit bizarre on the surface, but it is absolutely true and does not deceive people: sugar does contain carbon, and if you don't believe it, we can find a way to take out the carbon inside.</p>
<p>We can take a teaspoon of white sugar for seasoning from the kitchen and put it on the lid of a cigarette can or another tin can: then clamp the lid with iron tongs and put it on the flame of an alcohol lamp or a coal stove and heat it vigorously. When burning, the white sugar gradually melts and turns into a brown liquid, and finally it burns into a black solid. This black thing does not taste like anything on the tongue, and it will burn by itself when put in a fire; what is this thing? It is the "carbon" we mentioned above.</p>
<p>Facts are the most eloquent. After doing the above small experiment, we extracted black carbon from the sweet sugar with our own hands; we can rest assured that sugar does contain carbon, but the carbon in the sugar has changed its appearance, so we don't recognize it.</p>
<p>Now you can write this down in your notebook.</p>
<h3>Karma</h3>
<p>— Huren</p>
<p>A fox ran panting, followed by a hunting dog and a hunter, who were also following closely behind. Although the fox ran extremely fast, the hunting dog refused to let it go.</p>
<p>The fox ran for a long time and met a woodcutter who was carrying a load of firewood from across the street. "Uncle! Please...save...me! Behind...the hunting dog...is chasing after me!" It begged with a very pitiful expression. "No, you stole two of my chicks the day before yesterday. You hateful thing, now you are asking me?" After saying that, he left without looking back. The fox went on its way very disappointedly.</p>
<p>The fox ran for a long time again and saw a sheep mother sewing clothes in front of the house, so it begged piteously again, "Grandma sheep! Please be compassionate and let me...hide in your house...The hunter is chasing behind!" "Bah! You bad kind! You're here again! You stole one of my sons the night before yesterday, and you're here again today?" She rushed over in anger as if fire was coming out of her eyes. The fox had to turn around and escape again.</p>
<p>After two rests, the distance between the fox and the hunting dog became closer.</p>
<p>It saw a tabby cat sleeping on the ground, "Miss Cat, please...hurry...save me!...The hunter is coming...!" "Hush! No! You are the worst thing in our village, go, go quickly!"</p>
<p>"Bang!" With a sound, the fox fell in response, and the hunting dog rushed up and bit it in one bite.</p>
<h3>Backbone</h3>
<p>— Zhaifu</p>
<p>The two words "backbone" represent a person's style. We praise those with strong wills and noble character as having "backbone," while those with weak wills and base character are said to "lack backbone." Throughout history, loyal ministers, righteous warriors, and steadfast martyrs have all been people with backbone; the ungrateful and those who sell their country for personal gain are people without backbone. Flesh and skin are soft, but if a person has no bones, they are just a mass of flesh and skin, unable to stand upright or move! If bones are not strong and solid, how can one bear heavy burdens and travel far?</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Yang Jiaoshan, a loyal minister who was framed and killed by the treacherous minister Yan Song, had a couplet: "Iron shoulders bear the burden of righteousness, a sharp hand composes articles." The so-called "iron shoulders" and "sharp hand" refer to the backbone of loyal and righteous individuals.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the downfall of many countries has not been at the hands of enemies, but at the hands of traitors who lacked backbone and willingly became the running dogs of the enemy.</p>
<p>Why would a good citizen become a traitor? Is it because they lack clothing or food? Individuals like Yin Rugeng were originally officials in the service of their own government, enjoying a life of luxury; they were not driven by hunger or cold! It was simply because they were never nurtured with the backbone to be a proper human being.</p>
<p>"Strong grass is known in a strong wind; a loyal minister is known in chaotic times." Those with backbone, the more difficult their circumstances and the more chaotic the world, the more they must demonstrate their integrity in serving the country loyally.</p>
<p>To become a loyal and righteous person in the future, one must cultivate the backbone of loyalty and righteousness from childhood; to cultivate the backbone of loyalty and righteousness, one must possess the following tenets for establishing oneself:</p>
<p>Do not covet luxury!</p>
<p>Do not entertain extravagant fantasies!</p>
<p>Do not yield to violence!</p>
<p>Do not bully the weak and the poor!</p>
<p>Do not love money!</p>
<p>Do not fear death!</p>
<h3>Little Black Charcoal</h3>
<p>(1) A child sees a chair with a broken leg.</p>
<p>(2) The leg is fixed, making it look like a complete chair.</p>
<p>(3) Little Black Charcoal walks along reading a book, sees a chair, and sits down.</p>
<p>(4) Haha! Little Black Charcoal falls over!</p>
<h3>Speech Practice</h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>For anyone who wants to convey their meaning and gain understanding and sympathy from others, an engaging speech is indispensable. In the election contests of politicians, the most effective weapon is speech, used to announce one's aspirations and policies, creating a good impression on the audience and inspiring them to cast their votes with sympathy. This is true for politicians, and it's also true for academics. An academic with in-depth research, on the one hand, can publish their research findings in writing, but at the same time, they must also have excellent speaking skills to be used when invited by schools or organizations to give speeches. Even an entrepreneur who has created excellent products needs excellent speech to assist in promotion. In short, regardless of what field one will serve in the future, every child should strive to practice speech.</p>
<p>The most difficult step in practicing speech is being able to speak on stage as if no one else is there. Generally, those who practice speech always have a good idea in their mind and make ample preparations before going on stage. But when they step onto the stage and see dozens or hundreds of eyes staring directly at their face, they suddenly blush, their heart pounds violently, and their mouth seems sealed, unable to open. The more anxious they become, the less they can say. Even if they force out a few sentences, it is difficult for the audience to understand. This is a common ailment among those who are new to speech. But this shyness is not difficult to eradicate. If the first time on stage is a failure, don't be discouraged; gather your courage and go on stage again the second time. Continue with persistent effort the third and fourth times. At most, it will not exceed the tenth time, and you will surely develop a thick skin that will absolutely not blush, and a calm heart that will absolutely not pound violently when you step on the stage. By then, even when standing in front of dozens or hundreds of eyes, you will be able to calmly and casually articulate what you want to say, one by one, from your mouth.</p>
<p>The material for a speech, regardless of its quality, must be organized like an essay, so that listeners can understand everything in an organized manner and feel clear and comprehensible. If you can also insert some interesting stories or anecdotes in each section to prevent listeners from feeling bored, that would naturally be even better. Therefore, it is best to extract a few main points of the speech in advance, so that there will be no mistakes when speaking. The posture during the speech should be as dignified and natural as possible, absolutely avoiding any forced or artificial attitude. The voice should not be too high or too low, because if it is too low, the audience will not be able to hear clearly, and if it is too high, it will not produce harmonious and pleasing sounds in the audience's eardrums. The most appropriate volume is only half a notch louder than ordinary conversation, which is enough. When speaking, slightly raising your head can also help to expand the sound waves.</p>
<p>Children, do you also want to become a speaker in the future? Speech is not a difficult thing. If you are happy, you can hold speech practice sessions once or twice every week in your class. After a year or two, you will already have a lot of experience.</p>
<h3>Where Does Silk Come From?</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhigang</p>
<p>The clothes we wear are made of cotton, silk, or other materials. I think the clothes children like the most must be those made of silk! However, many children do not know the origin of silk. Now I will tell you:</p>
<p>First, take the silkworm eggs (Figure 1) and incubate them. In a few days, many small silkworms will hatch (Figure 2). After the small silkworms hatch, immediately gather mulberry leaves (Figure 3). The mulberry leaves that are gathered are too big for the small silkworms to eat, so they must be cut into small pieces (Figure 4). Feed the cut mulberry leaves to the small silkworms (Figure 5). After a few days, the small silkworms will start to sleep! After many days, they will sleep four times in a row (Figure 6). After the fourth sleep, they will go onto the frame and start to spin cocoons (Figure 7). Take the cocoons down and reel the silk (Figure 8). Use machines to weave the reeled silk into silk fabrics (Figure 9).</p>
<p>Our country produces a lot of silk fabrics, especially Zhejiang and other provinces. A large amount is exported to foreign countries every year (Figure 10).</p>
<p>However, the price of silk has plummeted recently. The reasons for this are the abundance of rayon in the market and the poor quality of silk production. As a result, it cannot be widely sold domestically and cannot be promoted abroad. Looking back at our neighbor Japan, their silkworm farming methods were originally learned from us, but because they study and know how to improve, their results are very good. We must work hard to study and improve!</p>
<h3>Filial Piety (3)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>However, Perskov trusted in the kindness of Heaven. Now that it had given her that precious passport, it would certainly help her overcome all other difficulties. She trusted Heaven on the one hand, and on the other hand, she was full of self-confidence, believing that as long as she was determined, no resistance would be a problem. Finally, she got her parents' permission and was scheduled to leave on September 8th.</p>
<p>That morning, as soon as it dawned, she was already dressed and ready, with a small leather bag slung over her shoulder. Her father wanted her to take the only silver ruble in the house, but she refused to accept it, saying that the money was really not enough to cover her travel expenses to Petersburg, and it was better to leave it at home, as it might be needed. But her father sternly ordered her to take it, and she had no choice but to accept it. Two poor neighbors also insisted on giving her all the money they had, a total of thirty copper kopecks and a twenty-kopeck silver coin, but she resolutely refused. She only thanked them for their kindness and sincerely promised them that she would do her best to help them, as they might have the hope of being pardoned as well.</p>
<p>When the first ray of sunlight shone into the room, it illuminated a brief moment of solemn silence, according to the beautiful ancient Russian custom, to bless the traveler with a safe journey. Then they said a few more words to each other, gave one last embrace, Perskov knelt down to receive her parents' blessing, then stood up and resolutely set out—a nineteen-year-old girl, with only one silver ruble in her pocket, walking through vast forests, traveling far to Petersburg to see the dignified emperor.</p>
<p>The two poor neighbors, to show their kindness, especially accompanied her out of Iji Village, until they met a group of girls who happened to be going the same way to a small village, and entrusted them to take good care of her, then told her to take care. On the way, they were disturbed for a while by a few half-drunk young men and suffered some minor scares, but they finally drove them away. When they arrived at the small village, Perskov spent the night there peacefully. The next morning, she felt very tired, but after setting out, she couldn't help but be a little afraid of the loneliness on the road. However, when she thought of the blessing of the angels, her courage immediately returned; but because she was not familiar with the road, she walked for a long time in vain and still returned to the village where she had spent the night. She continued to go forward with great hardship, and still could not avoid getting lost often. Every time she asked people for the way to Petersburg, everyone always laughed at her. She didn't even know the name of the nearest place. All she knew was that she had to pass through Kyiv, a place called the holy town by the Russians. So every time people said they didn't know the way to Petersburg, she busily asked how to get to Kyiv. One day, she came to a fork in the road and saw several travelers passing by in a carriage, so she hurried to ask which road led to Kyiv. They laughed and replied, "You can walk any road you like, it's all good. These three roads can take you to Kyiv, Paris, or Rome." She had no choice but to choose the middle road to go, and fortunately she did not go wrong. However, she could not figure out any of the villages she passed along the way. Every time she came to a small village and asked for lodging in a humble house, she often received better treatment, but once she arrived in a big place, people regarded her as a suspicious woman and refused to take her in.</p>

<h3>The Crisis of Natural Science</h3>
<p>— Sijing</p>
<p>The world today is full of crises. There are political crises, economic crises, and strangely enough, even natural science, which serves as the model for science (including natural science and social science), is in crisis!</p>
<p>I think that most people who have not studied deeply will be surprised: Isn't this the era of natural science's omnipotence for the past few hundred years? The progress of human society in the past three hundred years surpasses that of the previous thousands of years; the improvement of material life, the development of productivity, and the rapid progress of civilization—are these not all gifts of natural science? Moreover, as society progresses, inventions and discoveries continue to emerge endlessly. From this perspective, natural science is not only the mother of civilization, but its future also seems very prosperous, and it is certainly not in crisis.</p>
<p>But if you look at it from another perspective, it will surprise you again: No matter how much natural science progresses, we have seen with our own eyes many people who are themselves great scientists, and who have even made inventions and discoveries in science, doubt science itself. They believe that science is not the "ultimate knowledge," and cannot thoroughly study the "true meaning" of the universe, and that science itself will reach a dead end, discovering its own falsehood and destruction. Therefore, science is unreliable and one must seek refuge in God and religion. For example, Heisenberg, Eddington, Jeans and other modern great scientists have said this. They have proved from scientific research that the objective universe is illusory, and only subjective existence is real. The development of wave mechanics has led to the establishment of the "uncertainty principle," thereby denying the law of causality and necessity in the objective world; the development of electrical science has led to the establishment of the theory that "matter has been destroyed"; the progress of mechanical research has led to the "separation of matter and energy theory," "independent existence of energy theory," and other theories. Other examples, such as the establishment of the theory of relativity, say that time and space only exist in the observer's subjectivity. All of these indicate that the theories of natural science are proving that the universe is unreal.</p>
<p>The reason why natural science reached the stage of science earlier than other sciences is that its research object is the objective, tangible material world, unlike social science or thought science, whose research objects are more unpredictable and difficult to grasp and analyze. Moreover, the methods of natural science are also empirical, such as the inductive method and the experimental method. In short, natural science was originally materialistic, so it was easy to become a science. But why is it now not working, unable to progress, and has to retreat into the quagmire of metaphysics to seek refuge in God and religion? Is this really a crisis of natural science itself?</p>
<p>Obviously, the evils that mankind has created or is in the process of creating—war, with its ferocity and cruelty—are entirely aided by science. Therefore, many humanitarian people who are concerned about the world believe that this is the fault of science itself. But in reality, science is beneficial to mankind. As for its assistance in the slaughter of mankind, this is not the sin of science itself, but the sin of a few people in society who use science to seek their own interests and destroy others, thereby also destroying mankind. Similarly, the crisis of natural science is not something that is bound to happen and cannot be avoided, but is due to the fact that natural scientists are limited by their social class, and cannot grasp the ever-progressing natural science. Because of their distorted worldview, because of their mechanical and outdated methodology, they not only cannot promote the development of science, but also hinder it.</p>
<p>Natural science, like art and literature, is part of the superstructure of society. Moreover, natural science has a more direct relationship with productivity than other ideologies, and it is easier to promote productivity and have a reciprocal effect on it. Because of this, when the productivity of the infrastructure is constrained and cannot develop, the natural science that is directly related to it will also be stagnant or in crisis. The current economic panic and political crisis are entirely due to the fact that the production relations of the social system hinder the development of productivity, and indirectly also hinder the development of natural science. For example, productivity could originally continue to develop, but in this capitalist society, where the purpose is to make profits, most hardworking people who do not have the means of production and only sell their labor do not have the money to buy the large quantities of goods produced by very advanced machinery, and therefore a panic of overproduction occurs. In this panic, production stagnates, and therefore natural science, which promotes the technological progress of production, is also forced to stagnate. Because if science progresses further, technology will be more developed, production will increase more, and at the same time, production will be more surplus and more panicked, so it has to be stopped. This is the crisis of the social system reflected in the crisis of natural science, but this is by no means a crisis of natural science itself.</p>
<p>Next, let's see what the characteristics of the current crisis of natural science are. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, the discovery of X-rays, radium, and radioactive rays caused enormous changes in physics. The two principles of "conservation of mass" and "conservation of energy" seemed to have been overturned. In the twentieth century, the discovery of the principle of relativity added another layer of chaos. It seems that as long as we discuss the equality of mass and energy according to the theory of relativity, the most important energy will disappear and escape. So, what caused such an absurd conclusion? This is not the reason for natural science itself. In reality, it is because the initial natural science, its research objects were still very simple, the research on each object was not very deep, and the scope of research was not very broad, so the principles of mechanism and the empirical method were enough to use. But when new inventions increase and reach deeper and larger fields, the previous partial, outdated, and mechanical viewpoints and methods can no longer control this vast material. So, as a result, it cannot analyze the materials it has excavated with existing methods, so it is suspicious and says "matter has been destroyed!" "Energy exists independently!" In short, this is due to idealism and the mechanical formal logic. This is also because the entire infrastructure is being prevented from moving forward, and it is reflected in ideology, and it becomes subjectivism, mechanism, etc. As for the mechanical materialism viewpoint of the early stage of natural science, it still poisons it and constitutes a part of its crisis.</p>
<p>So, how can the crisis of natural science be overcome? This must also be said from two aspects: The crisis from the social aspect is the main crisis. This cannot be escaped simply from natural science itself. It is necessary to make productivity unfettered and able to move forward freely. Therefore, the current production relations that bind the development of productivity—that is, the social system—must be changed, and natural science can then develop. This is not only a problem of natural science, but also a problem of social science and social reform. Finally, we must input new viewpoints and new methods into the research of natural science, and use more inclusive and comprehensive correct new viewpoints to study natural science. For example, if we stand on the position of materialism, the conclusion that "matter has been destroyed" will not be reached, because regardless of whether you are electricity, energy, mass, or quantity, it is nothing more than a form of existence of matter, but one of its attributes. These forms of existence and attributes, no matter how they change, are always independent of our subject. Also, if we use dynamic logic, we will not advocate "separation of matter and energy theory" or "independent energy theory," but advocate "unity of matter and energy theory," because all matter exists in motion and change, and all matter can also be transformed into each other at the same time. If we use the above viewpoints and methods, the so-called "uncertainty principle," the problem of biological mutations, etc., can be properly resolved. Also, we must follow the development of natural science to predict its future laws, and should not stubbornly stick to the established realm and completely use the past to measure the present and the future. Because in the process of progress, the research itself can develop its methods. For example, the advocacy of the uncertainty principle is due to the study of the movement of electrons in atoms, but what is the structure of the space inside the atom is not yet known. We should actively work to study the structure of the extremely small space inside the atom, and the theory of the uncertainty principle will be self-defeating in the future. Therefore, in continuous research, some mistakes are also made, but at the same time, some mistakes will be overcome. Combining the above methods, the crisis of natural science may be eliminated?</p>

<h3>The Great Fire on the Banks of the Luan River</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhang</p>
<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon. Having a few hours of free time, I went for a walk outside the school, slowly walking along the Luan River embankment east of the city. About an hour later, I turned back towards the school and met my good friend Zhiqing.</p>
<p>"Shunan! Hurry! What books do you have? Quickly check them! Destroy anything that 'they' deem inappropriate!" Zhiqing said to me with both sorrow and anxiety.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I was bewildered, not knowing why he was so anxious.</p>
<p>"This... it's not convenient to talk here. Come to the study hall—you'll understand." He shook his head, grabbed my hand, and dragged me to the study hall. The road to the study hall was very quiet; I didn't see a single classmate—only a few school servants hurrying back and forth in a state of panic. "What happened?" I kept wondering as I approached the study hall door.</p>
<p>In the study hall, there were many classmates. Some looked very disheveled, some even had tears in their eyes as if they were about to cry, and some were muttering to themselves, not knowing what they were saying. These classmates were all gritting their teeth, checking their own bookshelves and cabinets. Clearly, some disaster had occurred! The smell of burnt paper entered my nostrils, evoking the unpleasant feeling of burning paper money after someone's death. In the middle of the room, a pile of flames stretched very high, almost licking the ceiling. Students were still continuously throwing their books, scraps of paper, and letters into the fire, and sadness and resentment filled everyone's heart! At this moment, I truly felt like I was lost in a fog. My nerves were confused, and I just stood there staring at them.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>My heart kept asking, "Why are they burning books in the study hall?" But my mouth couldn't say it! My classmates also occasionally turned their heads to glance at me, as if they didn't recognize me. After burning their books, the classmates hurriedly left, wanting to find a safe haven, but this land was still in "their" hands! After a while, I heard the sound of hurried footsteps outside the room.</p>
<p>I immediately woke up from my dream and quickly asked Zhiqing to tell me what had happened.</p>
<p>"Just now, our principal was surrounded by the constabulary of the Eastern Hebei Government. They came to inquire about the 'Teachers' Union' distributing leaflets at the Ao Dong Games; at the same time, the military department called saying they were coming to inspect the school…" Zhiqing hadn't finished speaking when his face had already turned pale. His voice stimulated his heart, and he couldn't continue speaking.</p>
<p>Yu Zhou, another classmate burning books in the stove room, heard the footsteps in the study hall and hurriedly opened the door to look around.</p>
<p>"Yu Zhou!" This was the anxious voice of the Dean of Students; "Don't burn them in the study hall—who will be responsible if the building catches fire? And isn't the ash on the ground just giving 'them' more suspicion? Or… they're about to come—…"</p>
<p>"Oh dear!" I heard myself exclaim. I felt as if I had been thrown into cold ice. I suddenly remembered the "Educational New Tide" I bought… here it comes. These were all considered forbidden by "them" and written on the police station's announcements.</p>
<p>"This is too dangerous!" I thought; and immediately went to open my book cabinet, dragging out all the magazines, letters from a certain newspaper office, envelopes, "Educational New Tide," and my own manuscripts. I carefully checked everything repeatedly, and then asked Zhiqing to help me destroy them together. "Come on, let's go burn them at the public stove." Saying that, I dragged Zhiqing away.</p>
<p>The area in front of the public stove was already crowded with classmates, and there was no room for us to squeeze in. Two classmates were arguing with each other because one of them wanted to squeeze forward. My heart was filled with panic, "When will I be able to finish? The inspectors might be coming!" I thought.</p>
<p>The water in the tea kettle was boiling hot. The small room was filled with steam, and you could hardly see the person across from you. The students' hearts and mouths were weighed down by a heavy stone of sorrow. There wasn't a sound in the room, only the sound of paper burning and the sighs from the water kettle breaking the deathly silence. The fire was extremely large, and paper ashes poured out from the chimney continuously.</p>
<p>I couldn't wait any longer. I went to squat at the corner of the wall outside the public stove house and started burning my books—my beloved books—on the mud ground! I was very afraid that the fire would spread like wildfire… my hands were trembling… my heart was pounding… my body was getting hot… Alas! Students of Luandong!</p>

<h3>The Lone Island in the North Sea That Will Sink</h3>
<p>— Wu Hua</p>
<p>According to geographers, the sea from the Scandinavian Peninsula to Holland and Germany was entirely a solid ice sea in ancient times. Around 25,000 years ago, due to climate conditions, the ice sea melted and became the North Sea as it is today. In the North Sea, there is a lone island struggling against the sea waves, with an area of less than 250 acres, which is the unfortunate Helgoland Island.</p>
<p>According to scientists' estimates, the unfortunate island of Helgoland was originally five times larger than it is now when it first appeared. However, because it has been constantly attacked by raging waves and eroded by the sea since its emergence, its territory has been shrinking day by day. In the past hundred years alone, it has been losing about one acre of area every ten years. At this rate, its existence is certainly a cause for concern.</p>
<p>However, the erosion of the sea waves on this lone island is very chronic and not like the imperialist aggression against weak nations, which quickly swallows it all up. Judging from the current situation, the island's lifespan is at least three to four thousand years. Therefore, the two thousand islanders currently living on the island do not find the continued erosion of the entire island by sea waves frightening. What they are most worried about is the fate of a mile-long sandbar in the eastern sea of the island. Because this sandbar can be said to be the lifeline of the entire island; if it sinks, the lives of the islanders on the lone island will immediately be in dire straits. Why is this sandbar so important to them? This is hard to explain in a few words.</p>
<p>Originally, in the northwest of the sandbar, between the island and the sandbar, there is a white cliff, as the islanders call it. There, high-quality chalk (white earth) is extracted, first by Hamburg merchants! At the same time, the islanders rely on doing this work for a living. Unfortunately, due to the attacks of storms and raging waves, the large white cliff, which stood 200 feet above the water, was destroyed. Now, only the shadow of the cliff top can be seen at low tide, becoming a large reef. This cannot but be said to be nature's playfulness with mankind.</p>
<p>After losing the white cliff, the only way for the islanders of the lone island to survive is to catch fish and seabirds. In 1806, Napoleon captured Berlin and actively sought to conquer Europe; in order to conquer Britain, he imposed an economic blockade on it, prohibiting European countries from trading with it and forbidding British and its colonial ships from stopping at European ports. As a result, the British were forced to pay attention to the lone island of Helgoland and saw it as an excellent place for secret trade. For a time, British stores rushed to establish branches in Shanghai, and merchants often came here to engage in business, giving this unfortunate North Sea island the elegant name of "Little London" and making it a considerable commercial city; and the lives of the island's residents were thus somewhat improved. But later, this fortunate economic blockade against Britain was lifted, and secret trade was naturally no longer necessary. Helgoland Island became British territory, so the islanders lost their source of income again and suffered a tragic fate.</p>
<p>It is truly necessary to thank God. When the islanders of the lone island fell back into a state of poverty, one of their experts suddenly had a flash of inspiration and came up with a plan, which was to plan to open a seawater bathing beach on the sandbar to attract visitors from Northern European countries to come here to escape the summer heat. This plan succeeded after a long period of effort and overcoming many difficulties. Now, during the three or four months of summer each year, there are thousands of people from Germany and Northern European countries who come here to escape the summer heat and bathe. The spending of these visitors in three or four months is the source of livelihood for the islanders of the lone island.</p>
<p>However, now this sandbar only appears a few feet above the water at high tide; in the event of an extraordinary storm attack, a huge wave attack, it is in danger of being completely destroyed. This is simply an unimaginable thing for the islanders of the lone island.</p>
<p>Now, Helgoland Island belongs to Germany. The process by which the Germans obtained the island and what they have done here is not very simple. As mentioned above, this lone island was originally occupied by the British. It was only in 1890 that the British transferred it to the Germans. In order to obtain this North Sea island that will sink, Germany gave some of its colonies in East Friesland to the British. This is undoubtedly very thought-provoking. Germany's willingness to acquire this lone island at a significant cost certainly has its great intentions. Because in Germany's view, although this is a small lone island, it also has great military value. After obtaining the island, it immediately began to build a large military port here. On the one hand, it set up artillery positions in the commanding heights of the highlands and placed artillery pieces; on the other hand, it built tunnels between the military port and the artillery positions to store food, making it a major naval base for Germany. The Germans have also worked hard to defend against the attacks of wind and waves through artificial means, especially in the western part where the waves attack most fiercely, and have built large projects, as a result, the shrinking of the island has been greatly reduced. However, since the island itself is not composed of solid rock strata, it is difficult to resist the attacks of wind, rain, and waves.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Germany immediately forced the islanders to take their necessary belongings and board refugee ships to Hamburg within a few hours, and their remaining property was of course unconditionally occupied by the German army. During the four years and four months of the Great War, the islanders were used as cannon fodder by Germany, and many of them died; only a small number of survivors returned to this unfortunate island after the war to rely on the beach of the sandbar and live their unfortunate lives.</p>
<p>After the war, according to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, all military facilities on the island were dismantled. It is a bit terrifying to say that it took almost three years to dismantle the artillery positions and military port facilities, and every day there were explosions with rumbling sounds, and long-term earthquakes shook this North Sea island and the unfortunate people on it.</p>
<p>Now, the situation in Europe is more urgent than in 1914. Hitler has torn up the Treaty of Versailles, and his ambitious eyes can turn to Northern Europe at any time, so this North Sea island is likely to be re-armed at any time.</p>
<p>Confessions of a Working Woman</p>
<h3>Female Factory Workers</h3>
<p>— Ms. Chen Ying Talks</p>
<p>Every morning, the sky is just barely getting light, right? But for us who are used to hearing it, we have long heard the buzzing first echo from the factory chimney. At this time, the people who enjoy life are probably still in their dreams! But we have to quickly get out of bed and quickly wash up. Often before you can wash up leisurely, the buzzing second echo seems to be cursing us, calling us to hurry up! Hurry up! We have to quickly leave home and rush quickly to the factory. Because the third echo follows, and the factory's iron gate will be closed right after. However, I don't think I've ever seen the factory's black gate closed, which shows that I've never been late once. Although there have been several times when it was very dangerous, that is, when I felt like I was getting sick, my head was splitting, and I was too tired to get up, but when I thought about having to pay the bills and eat, I immediately felt like someone had poured a basin of cold water on my head, making it easy for me to get up and go out the door!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we can earn about thirteen or fourteen yuan per month per person. However, this refers to skilled workers who have been working for one or two years. They are all paid by piecework, and how much they earn each day is calculated according to the prescribed price per piece. If it is a novice, it is different. At first hearing, it will make those who want to become female workers frown. According to the rules of our ×× yarn factory, any new person who comes in does not get any money at all in the first month. Only after learning will they get two jiao and five fen per day; the first time they get paid monthly, they can only take twenty days of wages. Ten days are counted as stored work, and the money for this stored work can only be returned to you or given to your family when you stop working or die.</p>
<p>Speaking of this income, it is naturally not enough to cover expenses. However, if parents, sisters, and brothers can all work in the factory, then, if everyone's income is combined and used by everyone, it will be quite ample. If it is a single person, it costs about ten yuan per month to live in a house and eat, and sometimes they have to send some money to their parents living in the countryside, or have small social engagements, so they always feel that their money is not enough. Fortunately, their lives are quite careful and frugal. For example, when renting a house, most of them rent a kitchen shed together with two or three people. A slightly better one is the back building, but most of them rent the attic; eating is also cooked by everyone together. Because only in this way can everyone spare some time to do some odd jobs around the house. For example, if she cooks today, I can take the opportunity to wash my clothes; if I cook tomorrow, she can do her odd jobs. You know we are very busy. We enter the factory every day from five forty-five in the morning and have to work until six o'clock in the evening before we can go home. There is only one hour of rest in the middle for eating. We bring our own lunch in lunch baskets. Most of us cook rice and vegetables and bring some dried radish, watermelon rind, and other pickles to eat.</p>
<p>The yarn factory is densely packed with textile machines taller than people. Floss is constantly spewing out from those dog-tooth-like "spindles," flying everywhere like snowflakes and willow catkins. The room is full of it, and you can choke to death if you're not careful. But after a long time, you get used to it.</p>
<p>Even so, the people in our factory are the happiest among the female workers. Our factory is not small in scope. It weaves 1,400 bolts of ten-pound cloth and produces 40,000 flour sacks every day. As far as I know, the number of male and female workers in the whole factory is 2,100 just for those who live in the factory. The factory's employee dormitory is divided into four areas. The first area is the female worker trainee (novice) dormitory, with 50 bedrooms, each housing ten or more people, currently housing a total of 524 people. The second area is the single female worker (skilled worker) dormitory, with a total of 30 buildings, each with two floors, currently housing 611 people, also with ten or more people living in each room. The third area is specially for workers with families to live in, with a total of 33 buildings, currently housing 594 people. The fourth area is the single male worker dormitory, with 33 bedrooms, currently housing 401 people. Areas one and four are long rows of Western-style buildings with three floors, completely built of cement and steel. Hot and cold running water, iron beds, dining halls, sanitary toilets, bathrooms, washrooms, reading rooms, classrooms, and other facilities are very complete. There are also regulations: All female workers living in areas one, two, and three must go to area one to bathe once a day: male workers living in areas three and four must go to area four to bathe once a day. As for the facilities in areas two and three, they are only like ordinary alley houses outside the factory, but the prices are extremely cheap, and the expenses can be saved more than outside. The factory also has a consumer cooperative located near the center of each area, selling all daily necessities, including yarn, cloth, firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea, sugar, and other items. In terms of public health, there is also a five-story employee hospital, employing a medical director and a female obstetrics director, as well as two female nurses and a Chinese medicine doctor. All factory employees can receive free diagnosis and treatment. In addition, there is also a club, where there is a reading room, a library, a billiards room, and under the guidance of staff members, workers have organized basketball teams, tennis teams, football teams, ping-pong teams, opera troupes, drama troupes, music bands, and martial arts classes, etc., and all employees can freely participate in activities at the prescribed times. Moreover, we also have to receive compulsory education! It is said that there are several tutoring schools in our factory: divided into morning and evening schools for male workers, and morning and evening schools for female workers. All factory employees must serve as volunteer teachers in this school.</p>
<p>However, in some places, the facilities seem to be incomplete, so that workers are often injured and have their limbs broken by the machine belts. In Yangshupu, you can often hear a very miserable "wuwuwu" sound. That means that among our group of laborers, another one has suffered misfortune!</p>

<h3>Fresh Water</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruhui</p>
<p>The passenger ship "Adel" sailed out of the Hettara Strait, carrying a full load of passengers. The sharp-angled bow pierced the sea surface, breaking through the surging waves and spraying white foam; the tall chimney carried a long, thick black smoke trail, stretching far across the endless water. This monster-like large ship proceeded steadily forward amid the rising and falling of the sea and the shining of the sunlight. The shipowner happily smoked a cigar and paced lightly back and forth on the deck.</p>
<p>The passenger ship sailed day and night. The machinery in the engine room rattled incessantly, and the chimney continued to spew out black smoke. Everything was beautiful, and everything was filled with an atmosphere of peace, but the shipowner's brow was furrowed; he no longer strolled leisurely, nor did he happily smoke his cigar. He went into the kitchen and then went out again; this strange behavior attracted the attention of the passengers, so they asked the shipowner to announce the mystery, and surrounded him, firmly demanding that he explain the reason for his unease, because they were convinced that the shipowner's sorrow was naturally not his personal matter.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" The shipowner said hesitantly, with a fireless cigarette holder in his fingers. He no longer paid attention to it. "Gentlemen! Our 'Adel' has not broken any parts, nor has it encountered any danger. It can safely take us to our destination. It's just that we lack our drinking water. According to the kitchen report, the fresh water stored on the ship is only enough for two days of use. After two days, we will no longer have fresh water. This has a very large impact on your health. We still have eight days of journey. We will be cut off from fresh water for one hundred and forty-four hours!"</p>
<p>So the crowd on the deck stirred up a great commotion. Disorderly discussions were boiling. Some ran into the kitchen to inspect the water tanks, some were yelling angrily, and some were reporting the news to all the people they knew or didn't know.</p>
<p>"What are we going to do? Mr. William!" A passenger questioned the shipowner impatiently.</p>
<p>"Mr. William! This is your responsibility!" Another shouted.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." The shipowner nodded pitifully, putting his hands in his trouser pockets, with a helpless expression of calmness on his face, leaning against the railing like a puppet.</p>
<p>"Oh, we're really unlucky to be on this unlucky passenger ship." The gentleman's wife pouted and muttered!</p>
<p>"How can we do without fresh water? Seawater is not good to drink. We are not used to being saltwater fish." The young ladies said shrilly, shaking their heads with unhappy faces.</p>
<p>"How can we do without fresh water?" Everyone echoed in unison.</p>
<p>The shipowner spoke again: "Let me send a telegram to a neighboring ship. Perhaps they can help a little and send us some fresh water, which is still unknown." The telegram was sent, and everyone waited silently for a reply for the time being. Not long after, a reply telegram came, not agreeing to their request, but giving them an effective instruction. The neighboring ship's telegram said: "Your ship is sailing in fresh water. You need fresh water. Please load up as much as possible nearby!"</p>
<p>So the crew scooped up a bucket of water and tasted it, and it was indeed fresh water. So the whole ship was amazed at this wonderful encounter. They rejoiced at finding life in despair, and prayed to thank God, believing that God's gift was abundant and His compassion for people was all-encompassing.</p>
<p>The shipowner, with a mouthful of fresh water, unfolded his smiling dimples. He did not want to thank God for his great kindness. He thought that a ship immersed in fresh water would also ask others for help with fresh water, so he deeply sighed, "People in happiness do not know they are happy!"</p>
<p>The passengers were satisfied, even happier than before they discovered the fresh water.</p>

<h3>Theory and Practice</h3>
<p>— Fu Zhi</p>
<p>I remember that during the Ming Dynasty, there was a man in Jiangnan named Wu Shi. He was originally a fair-faced scholar who was completely ignorant of martial arts and military strategy. He merely read some of the "Yin Fu Conspiracy" of Taigong and the military strategies of Sun Wu on the surface. He boasted about himself in his hometown, saying how well he understood the mysteries of Sun Wu's military strategies and how he could use troops well. He also gathered many peers to his home and followed what the books said to practice the methods of "striking, stabbing, sitting, and acting." He thought he was "unparalleled in the world," but when the Yuan people invaded at the end of the Ming Dynasty, the country heard of his great name and asked him to be a general. He still "followed the book," using the "striking, stabbing, sitting, and acting methods" that he had pondered in his house to deal with the enemy. But when he got to the battlefield, it turned out that it was not the same thing. What he had studied was useless, and as a result, he was captured by the Yuan soldiers.</p>
<p>From this story, we know that simply sitting and talking without actually taking action is certainly "building a car behind closed doors that doesn't fit when you go out." Moreover, even if you act, if your action is confined to a house and is isolated from the actual activities of society, then no matter how hard you act, it is still "building a car behind closed doors that doesn't fit when you go out."</p>
<p>Speaking of Wang Yangming of the Ming Dynasty, I am afraid everyone knows him. He was a master of Neo-Confucianism, specializing in "clarifying the mind and seeing the nature" and "investigating things to extend knowledge." He can be regarded as having achieved something in learning theory. But one day, he wanted to use his "investigating things to extend knowledge" skill to "investigate" the bamboo in front of the court. He "investigated" it for three days, not only did he not understand the bamboo at all, but also his brain was "investigated" and his body became ill. Only then did he give up using his "investigating things to extend knowledge" skill to investigate real objects and instead went to "investigate material desires and extend innate knowledge." What is gratifying is that after suffering this hardship, he actually proposed the theory of "unity of knowledge and action." This theory means that knowledge—that is, theory—and action—that is, practice—are inseparable. He also said, "Knowing is acting, and acting is knowing."</p>
<p>The above is based on the aspect of only talking and not acting, that is, only talking about theory and not practicing. What about those who only practice and do not study theory?</p>
<p>"Old farmers" and "old gardeners" must be considered to be practicing every day in agriculture and horticulture, but why can't they improve and advance agriculture and horticulture? Why have these two remained in primitive management methods for thousands of years? Some patriots are undoubtedly extremely loyal to the nation and the country. They can commit suicide by jumping into the river, organize blood soul assassination groups, and sacrifice their lives to love the country. This must be said to be brave practice and action, but is such narrow patriotism really beneficial to the nation and the country?</p>
<p>From this point of view, "sitting and talking" without "getting up and acting" is certainly wrong, but simply practicing without studying theory is also impossible, especially in today's society.</p>
<p>Originally, human life is a process of practical action. The Chinese Lao Tzu and the German Goethe both said, "In the beginning was the act," which shows that action comes first and practice comes first. But as human society progressed, human practice and human social activities constituted many experiences. Later actions are the continuation of previous experiences. If later actions are not based on previous experiences, wouldn't we still have to "drill wood to make fire" and "drink blood" now? Later actions use the experience gained from the results of previous actions to guide present actions and help present practice. Since this is the case, we should study the results of previous actions before acting. Organizing those experiences becomes theory. Theory originally comes from practice, and later it can guide and help practice. Furthermore, future practice must be guided by the theories of past and present practice results, so past and present practice is refined into a theory for future practice. In short, this means that theory cannot be separated from practice, and practice cannot be separated from theory.</p>
<p>Some people think that theory and practice can be separated, exist independently, and can be divided into different tasks. This is not right. There is absolutely no theory in the world that can develop absolutely independently without practice. All scientific theories will never progress if they are not used in engineering practice. All social theories, if they are irrelevant to the current society and cannot contribute to the improvement or transformation of society, will lose their qualification as social theories. Therefore, for theory to be able to develop, it must not only be a concrete theory, a theory produced from practice, and a theory that conforms to reality, but also during this period and stage of becoming a theory, it must be constantly integrated into and permeate the practice process. Practice is constantly accompanied by theory, using theory as a compass and proceeding in this direction. At the same time, in the process of practice, theory is constantly being verified, revised, and enriched. Engineering practice progresses and science also progresses. Science progresses and engineering practice also progresses. In the course of social movements, social policies and social theories are produced. At the same time, these theories guide social improvement and social transformation. "Theory without practice is empty, and practice without theory is blind." Theory and practice are unified in this process of contradictory development. Some people only grasp the famous saying "Without theory, there is no action," and think that theory can be studied independently and developed independently, which is not right. As for raising theory because of this sentence, thinking that theory is standing on the commanding heights, issuing orders, and directing practice, that is even more wrong. If we say so, then we can go to the battlefield to charge into battle by simply studying Sun Wu's military books in the house. Isn't this as ridiculous as that boastful Wu Shi? If theory is standing high on the commanding heights directing practice, then that kind of theory is also unrealistic and does not conform to reality. How can it still guide practice?</p>
<p>In fact, practice is the most important and fundamental. Blind practice is certainly wrong, but theory always arises from practice and is for the sake of practice. Moreover, the correctness or error of theory must be corrected in practice. Incorrect theories are overthrown and revised in the process of social practice, and practice creates theories that conform to itself. Moreover, whether a theory is correct or not is not determined solely by the comparison of various theories, but by whether that theory conforms to reality. Therefore, in conclusion, theory and practice are both important, but practice is still the leading factor.</p>
<p>Today's society has reached the most contradictory stage, and people can no longer survive blindly in it—regardless of the country and the individual. We should acquire the legacy of theory to engage in practice, and especially learn theory and generate theory in practice.</p>
<h3>Introduction to "How to Study Philosophy"</h3>
<p>(Written by Wang Teff, published by Sanjiang Bookstore, priced at seven corners)</p>
<p>The author of this book has written many theoretical works on philosophy and science. This book, "How to Study Philosophy," is his recent work. The whole book uses new viewpoints and methods to systematically and comprehensively explain how to study philosophy. The writing is exceptionally fluent and popular, but the content is not superficial.</p>
<p>The content of this book is divided into nine chapters: Chapter 1, "What Kind of Science is Philosophy," includes the objects dealt with by philosophy, the types of philosophy, and what kind of science philosophy is. Chapter 2, "Why Should We Study Philosophy," includes philosophy and life, philosophy and science, etc. Chapter 3 is "The Empirical and Experimental Methods of Studying Philosophy," Chapter 4 is "How to Conduct Analytical Research," Chapter 5 is "How to Conduct Comprehensive Research," Chapter 6 is "How to Conduct Critical Research," Chapter 7 is "The Steps of Research," and Chapters 8 and 9 are on the outline of philosophy, indicating a concrete posture of philosophy for readers.</p>
<p>In this small work, it not only provides us with a method of philosophical research and a philosophical outline, but also reveals many new opinions. It especially elaborates on correct arguments on the issues that are currently being debated most fiercely in the philosophical world, such as the "existence and abolition of philosophy," the "relationship between philosophy and science," and the "internal divisions of philosophy." This is a point that those who study philosophy in general should pay special attention to.</p>

<h3>Talking about Hakka Customs</h3>
<p>— Xin Chu</p>
<p>I came to the South for business and spent nearly a year among the Hakka people in Fujian and Guangdong. During this period, I often came into contact with Hakka people. I think the Hakka people are somewhat different from other ethnic groups in China. Perhaps the Hakka people themselves and foreigners who have lived in the Hakka people for a long time do not know this very well, because they are all used to it.</p>
<p>The Hakka people migrated from the Central Plains. This has been clarified by experts in all aspects; for example, regarding the textual research on the Hakka people's migration from the Central Plains, some people say that they migrated three times, and some people say that they only migrated twice. However, regardless of whether it was two or three times, it is generally recognized that the Hakka people migrated from the Central Plains. In linguistics, Yang Gongheng has proved that the Hakka language has many ancient sounds of the Central Plains; the recent Confucian Yi Taiyan's "Lingwai Erzhou Language" also proves that the essence of the Hakka language is no different from that of the Central Plains. Furthermore, in terms of the Hakka people's genealogy, if you ask any Hakka person, they will tell you: which province their ancestors migrated from; if you ask a slightly educated Hakka person, they will also tell you: in what era, from what place, and why they migrated here. Although the era they migrated from, the earliest group was in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Song Dynasty), they still retain the name of Hakka people. If they meet Hakka people</p>
