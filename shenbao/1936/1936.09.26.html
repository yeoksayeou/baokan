<h3>日方重要恊議後　已訓令川越繼續談判　冀由外交途徑解决一切　有田請許大使促蔣返京　日閣議决支强硬政策　相信蔣委員長產出排日主義</h3>
<p>（南京）外交界息、上海事件發生後、中日國交雖呈不安、但雙方外交當局均取寗靜態度，前途不致過分悲觀、川越將再度謁張外長、賡續上决範圍續行交換意見、惟時間尙未的定、（二十五日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）我駐日大使許世英、應日外相有田之邀請、於今日午後四時半往外務省訪問外相、雙方談話亘一小時餘之久、有田對目前之嚴重時局、希望蔣院長返京、俾獲調整、有田允着重於根除「排日主義」及根本調整中日關係兩點、許大使當允傳達有田之願望、並釋明國民政府之立塲、表示兩國相互從長討論之希望、（一十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府認張外長與川越大使之三次會議、鮮獲進步、外務省發言人今日宣稱、當南京會議方在進行之中、不幸事件連續發生、至堪遺憾、而尤其在張外長與川越大使之第三次會議、予日政府以悲觀之印象、雖然、吾人已訓令川越大使繼續在南京舉行談判、以冀由外交途徑解决一切問題、但苟非國民政府表示更大之誠意、則恐日本將以重大决心另取其他途徑之行動吾人相信蔣委員長具有至優越之才幹、如渠願望剷除「排日主義」則渠實能達到此目的云、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間今、得悉、日政府已訓令駐華日大使川越、與中國外長張羣繼續根本調整中日關係之談判、勿因虹口日水兵遇害案而停止、此為昨日外陸海三相會議所决定者、並决定命川越大使敦促南京政府請蔣委員長早日返京、俾渠得與蔣氏直接會議、此項决議、不啻為傾於一般高唱以武力對付中國者之冷水、而海軍方面似確欲續增日本駐華陸戰隊之實力、俾保護在華之日僑生命財產、並圖以地方之嚴峻行動應付續起之反日事端、但日政府目前似不致增加駐華之軍艦、且並未顯然議及作任何軍事行動、有經騐之日本政治家、皆充分承認中日兩國一旦陷入紛爭、遺患實不堪設想、此不僅因中國幅員廣大、其國內有種種特點、且因中國具有特殊之國際關係、而日本在道德上負有應為東亞安定大局主角之義務之故、但一般人雖相信最近各種不幸事件實屬有意妨害中日兩國間之關係、而日本政界確甚不滿於最近談判之進行、據今日外務省發言人聲稱、日本擬仍繼續談判、以解决中日間各問題、惟中政府苟不表示進一步之誠意、則此種談判實無益可言、果爾、則日本必須以大决心取其他計劃、該發言人又稱、川越大使近與中國外長張羣會談三次、頗令人感覺中國當局尙未眞正明瞭目前之局勢、故談判迄今無甚進步、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本有田外相今日下午邀請中國許世英大使至外務省面談、並請許氏將日本欲與蔣委長直接談判整個的調整中日關係之意、轉達中國政府、許氏當允卽電本國政府請示云、據日本時報本日刋載之社論、略稱日本政府極不願在華採取在何軍事或海軍之行動、希望能光榮避免之、不過以之為最後之手段而已、對於中國政府自將予以種種可能之機會、以便其自行應付目下之局勢、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日據此間官方消息、日本政府當局已吿知英國駐日大使克萊武、謂日本對於中國不欲採取急遽行動、日本駐華大使川越與中國外交部長張羣談判取締排日問題、仍將繼續進行云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）二十五日閣議時、有田外相詳細說明對華外交之折衝經過、謂現待目下滯留廣東黃埔之蔣委員長之返歸南京、以蔣委員長為交涉之對手、進行交涉、並說明最惡情形時之日方决意與日方有效適切之對策、請求各閣員之諒解、有田外相更於閣議散會後、留居首相官邸、會見廣田首相、對於對華之諸對策、曾舉行長時間之重要協議、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）三日川越大一二十五日已有詳細報吿使與張外長之會談內容、一到外務省、外務省卽開首腦部會議、檢討十五六兩日正式交涉之結果帝國政府以交涉方始主張之事、尙有未提出者、亦尙未詢問國府對此之意見、故决令川越大使仍留南京與須磨總領事恊力、依據三相會議之决定方針、進行交涉、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）上海日本居留民團長甘濃益三郞、二十五日晨到東京、卽赴外務省會見東亞局長桑島、報吿上海現狀、其决歷訪有田外相與海陸軍兩當局、為同樣之報吿、定於今晚離東京回滬、（二十五日同盟電）</p>

<h3>英美均重視滬案　英人以為關鍵在日　美認戰事不致發生</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英政府對於最近上海所發生之日水兵被殺事件、將以「拭目以覘其後」一語為方針、雖以為此事件之本身、似較一二八戰役之起因更為嚴重、惟其重要關鍵、端在日人之將如何利用之而已、目下似無任何特別理由、可以說明日本之欲乘此時而在華作更進一步之行動也云云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此時官方今日對於中日關係之發展、仍甚關切、但一般輿論、則認戰事不致發生、蓋上海附近中國並無駐軍、此與一九三二年時情形不同、而中國人民亦較一九三二年時為鎭定、（二十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>英方否認　港督過問中日問題　駐日英使訪外相解釋</h3>
<p>（東京）香港總督在廣東會見蔣介石、以至發生香港總督調解中日事端之謠言、英國外交部業已公式宣言、香港總督决無干涉中日問題之事、駐日英使克萊武亦奉英政府訓令、於二十四下午訪間外務省有田外相、與掘內决官、表示英國不願參加中日兩國進行之外交交涉、卽英使對外相謂、香港總督每年九月訪問廣州、此為慣例、因本年蔣氏留粤、兩人會見、交換談話、係不過儀禮的性質而巳、香港總督本無對中日問題發言之權限、又未曾有因此問題實行交涉之事實、且英國政府亦全無干豫中日問題之意志、希日政府不為誤解是幸、（二十五日同盟電）</p>

<h3>虹口之突發事件</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>自前晚虹口發生日水兵遭人槍擊之事件。駐滬日陸戰隊卽全體出動。施行非常警戒。一時燈火輝煌之市面。遂為肅殺氣象所佈滿。附近居民。亦無不惴惴慄慄。如臨戰地。嗣後日軍更復逐漸擴展防綫。深入閘北區域。任意檢查行人。其特殊行動之所啟示。允渾似一二八前夕之重臨。雖此項越界步哨。不久隨卽撤去。而地方嚴重狀態。依然未見鬆弛。吾人方馳慮於川漢事變之疊發。焦灼以求其速解。不意肘腋之地。又肇禍端。踵已往之糾紛。而更增其錯節。不祥哉今日之局面也。</p>
<p>在此極度緊張空氣之中。吾人首先所欲表示者。卽為蘄求雙方。勉抑戚情。勿令事態有擴大之虞。關於日水兵之遇害。吾人亦甚願致其歉意。蓋以友邦軍士。駐在我土。猝遇意外。不保其軀。我以地主立塲。誠不勝其遺憾。地方當局。殷勤慰問。協助緝兇。盡職實之所及。示友誼之敦睦。斯亦已耳。日方必欲有意督過於我。以種種威脅手段予人難堪。要非明達之見所應出此。茲回變故。逮論出事地點不在管轄範圍。就令保護周密。亦僅申其大要。突發事件之襲來。任何賢知難為之防。卽就最近駐日美代辦狄克沃佛捉賊遇刺一事而論。以日警配備之嚴。異國使節之尊。猶不能免此意外之打擊。而令宵小逞兇狄。氏受傷。則突發變故之難為周防可知。日外務省對狄氏。亦無非派員慰問表示遺憾竭力緝兇而已。在狄氏亦未聞有若何不滿之言詞。非分之要求也。蓋人類相與之際。原以諒解為基礎。誠意披洩之下。無事不可消弭。疑心內不自安。杯弓遂成蛇影。常人周旋。猶應相諒。矧在國際禮貌所關。詎可輕易逞忿浪。擲意氣。以造成如斯嚴重之局勢乎。</p>
<p>要之。事已至此。無庸再為是非曲直之論列。吾人為顧念地方安事計。唯望日方及早收篷。勿為已甚。一切急遽行動。只能為暫時之表示。否則危機所伏。有未堪設想考。須知任何酷愛和平之民族。亦必有其隱忍飽和之限度。日方果不欲存心惡化事態。則對此迫切之一面。必能予以平心靜氣之考慮也。</p>

<h3>國聯始總辯論　艾登滔滔發言　闡明英國政策　歐洲集團對峙威脅和平　容忍克已維持秩序要著　西代表指摘各國不干涉戰方式</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英外相艾登今日向國聯大會演說英國在默洲之政策、謂英國不欲見歐洲各國因政體而分野成為兩團、目前大局之嚴重、要當抒誠發言、故渠今日之演說、擇詞或不能較常時審愼、竊願與會諸君予以原諒、</p>
<p>國家主義今殊强盛、兩種不同之政體、已成對抗之勢、全世界各處之信任、一律趨弱、各國現皆銷費其國富繼長增高之部分於軍備、雖有害其經濟，亦不之顧、此非一種好現象，但今尙未至絕望之地步、各國今仍有團結工作之可能、彼等必須以容忍與克已為要務、彼等一味輕蔑他國之政體、不能增高自己政體之尊崇、英國不許任何人攘奪其民治、民治實為人人努力覔求自由與人格及和平之要素、須知我對於自己之政體作如是觀、則他人對於其自己之政體觀念適與我同，英國充分並完全接受此理、列國　有秩序生活之第一要着、厥為信仰自己國家的主義、同時並容忍他國的主羲，對於前途之信任、實為經濟復原本可缺之因素、彼等必須彼此尊重國家之制度、彼等且需一種國際秩序、此種秩序、終當代為列國間爭端之仲裁、</p>
<p>今必須覔取方法、使此約言得以實施、而後文明始可保全、否則文明必歸冺滅、英政府之政策，乃在以此種信仰置入國聯、考慮國聯之前途、要當注重兩道、一為國聯之機關、一為運用此機關之志願、後者較前者格外重要、但機關亦須加以改善也、</p>
<p>外相繼乃述及近今集體安全之未獲成功、謂其主因乃由於缺乏普遍性、及在其初期中未能取更有力之干涉、今唯力求共具普遍性、始能予國聯以充分之效果，而遏止對和平所作之威脅、</p>
<p>外相再决涉及改善國聯盟的之計盡、謂英政府相信在每一爭端之初期中、國聯行政院各理事必須明白表示彼等將為保全和平起見、準備作如何之干涉、此實萬不可少之舉、英政府之意、區域協定能設法增强國聯盟的之實施、故英政府决計與西歐各國談判此種協定、至於原料問題、乃應由國聯予以相當討論之事伴、英國準備應由國聯大會取趨向此途之步驟、</p>
<p>外相未乃述及軍備文題，謂英國須俟各國訂定軍備限制條約、而後始能罷行其目前程序、實則軍縮一舉、不僅涉及軍事、且涉及精神、不懂軍械當予放下、黷武之精神亦當予以消滅，英國當茲各國恣意擴張軍備、以求膨脹其威力之際、實小能坐視而無動作、外相之結語、籲請國聯大會努力成立一國際機關、以解决各國間之爭端、而免訴諸武力、（廿五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外相演辭　四項要點</h3>

<h3>西代表指責　接濟軍火</h3>
<p>自信政府必能勘亂艾登外相詞畢之後。西班牙外長伐的氏繼起發言、路謂我國政府現可證明、各國前因我國發生內亂所締結之不干涉協定、實乃有利於叛軍、我國倘非遇有一相僅略、則內亂早已結束、何謂侵略、卽某某國均以軍火接濟叛軍是也、台爾伐育旋提出結論云、我國政府、自信必能削平內亂、我國人民、不願生息於專制政體之下者、當以數百萬計、豈能束手待斃乎」云、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）西班牙外長伐的氏今日在國聯大會發言抨擊不干涉西班牙內戰政策、為一種不利西班牙政府之干涉政策、伐的氏保留稍緩在國聯提出此事之權、伐的謂不干涉西班牙內戰之方式、實為法律上之怪現象、乃政治制度與叛軍所願有之各國給予叛軍之精神上與物質上之助力、質言之、所謂不干涉者、乃代叛軍作積極的干涉、藉以封鎖西班牙政府耳、廿五路透電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）美聯社記者今日得悉、墨索里尼首相硏究最近局勢後、已决令暫留國聯、促成墨氏此項决定之原因有二、（一）意國在國聯禁止阿國代表出席前、拒絕與國聯合作、是在事實上不啻已退出國聯、（二）正式退出、將表示意德步驟業已一致、但墨氏深願英意對於地中海局勢能得妥恊云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據可靠方面稱、意大利政府已訓令出席日內瓦一切國際會議及國聯各種委員會各代表、立卽退席、但在政府方面指出此項策略、不能認為意大利與國聯正式斷絕關係、（廿五日國民電）內瓦方面、大的將由阿國駐英公使馬丁博士留駐、擔任出席大會首席代表、外傳法國政府或法國代表團曾向阿皇交涉、勸其自動撤回該國之出席代表、茲經法國代表團聲明、謂絕無其事云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國通信　英埃軍事同盟條約成立</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>連蘇格蘭人一起計算在內，只有四千六百多萬人口的英國本部，統治了四萬萬以上的殖的地人民，成為領土內無日落處的世界强國，怎麽英國人自己不覺得他是世界上最優秀的人種！四十年前英國政治家張伯倫說；我相信，不列顚人是歷來世界上統治種挨中最偉大的種族。這種觀念，就在今日你仍可以在每個英國人的臉上看出來。不過他們從來不會對你當面說破，要說呢，這一點也許就是英國人種優秀的地方！他統治了你，你還覺得他不算壞，最少不算頂壞。</p>
<p>貌似軟弱無能，這是火國人的第二個特畏。歷來有多少人曾經預言過，不列顚帝國行將崩毀的必然性。可是到了今日，這個帝國仍然健在。而且每一次戰爭的結果，獲利最多的又是英國人。歐戰以前，德國人說：</p>
<p>英國的兵士也會打仗嗎？好好讓他跑到德國來，我們派警察去抓。」歐戰時證明就德國軍隊也並沒有這種抓的能力。英國人從不讓他，敵人把他看得太起。最近莫索列尼宜佈，意大利可以動員八百萬大軍。不列顚帝國正式常備軍却只有二十萬人左右。假如你單在這數字上下工夫，那末你又會上當的了</p>
<p>許多人批評英國人冷血沒有情感一種最自私自利式的商人英國人却驕傲他的善於對付環境是的善於對付環境。他們的動作雖說梢為遲綏一點，但遲緩到剛好還來得及。歐戰時他們應許殖民地人民獨立，歐戰後却不惜用武力壓迫殖民地人民的獨立運動。數年前埃及國家黨人在英人眼中豈不是一仙十足的叛逆，一九三六年的今天英國不單承認在國家黨人治下的埃及獨立，甚至於兩國外交官杯酒交歡，訂立軍事同盟條約。也許你覺得他變化得太多了，可是這方是英國政治家的特色。</p>
<p>促成此次英埃條約，一方面固然山於埃及國家黨人努力於獨立運動，然而最重要的原因，還是意大利佔領了阿比西尼亞以後迫得英人不能不作這種讓步。當去年意大利軍隊侵入阿比西尼亞境內發生劇戰的時候，英國艦隊曾經動員在地中海一帶集中，有時意大利作一種包團的企圖。在這時期，論實力，英國在地中海上的領袖地位是絕對的。單地中海艦隊已比意大利全部海軍的噸數多出一倍，蘇伊士運河在英人手中，英國政治家更主張對意取强硬的態度，必要時似乎也不惜以武力相見。國聯對意的經濟制裁就是道種政策的產物。然而這一切都挽救不了阿比西尼亞的淪亡。終於慕索列尼得到了勝利，第一個失敗的人恰恰是我們道位不列顚帝國！</p>
<p>這是幾百年來英國外交史上第一次最悲慘的失敗，我們看到英外相艾登首先提出取消對意的經濟制裁就明白英國處境的為難。是否英國人眞的是個絕對的和平主義者？醫如說用武力可以維持得住英國在阿比西尼亞的利益，英人會不會眼巴巴地看阿比西尼亞讓意大利一口呑下去？英國道一次的失敗，失敗於它的軍備過於保守，失敗於它的動作遲緩。問題是在於歷年來英人不大注意新具的空軍，相反的意大利擁有鉅量的轟炸機。這批意大利的轟炸機在理論上對於英國地中海艦隊沒有一種極大的威嚇。空軍是否能够戰勝海軍，到了今日還缺乏事實上的證明。但是英人終於軟化了。當英國海軍部看到自己的艦隊要做第一次這種新式戰爭的試騐品時。他們覺得還是讓慕索列尼佔一次便宜來得好。</p>
<p>意大利的勝利，不但動搖到英國在地中海的地位，尤其是英國的非洲殖民地感到威嚇。雖然慕索列尼曾說過，意大利得到了阿比西尼亞已心滿意足，再也沒有別的奢望，但道話誰又敢相信！英國對意大利的防綫已由阿比西尼亞問題移至埃及問題。那是英國人所不能够坐視的，假如有人在他的帝國命脈點！蘇伊士運河區域轉念頭。英國人所最担心的，似乎並不是意大利的八百萬大軍，而是意大利人暗中去帮助埃及國家黨人的反英運動。放棄埃及，但能够保守得住蘇伊士運河，寗可放棄埃及。這就是這次英埃條約英國人的出發點。經過訂立這個條約以後，埃及所得到的是一個獨立的國家，英國所得到的，是一支帮助防禦蘇伊士運河的友軍。埃及人旣然達到了獨立的目的，不但此後沒有仇英的理由，相反的，保護蘇伊士運河，保護埃及自己的國土，就是他們自己的事情。蘇伊士運河的安全，已經變成為不列顚帝國與埃及間共同的命運。有了這個前提，英國人才　這麼博槪地　牲了許多已經獲得的利益、所以英國輿論對於此次英埃條約的簽訂，大部份都加以熱烈　歡迎。只有少數「死硬　」的報紙才覺得英國不應該這樣吃虧。例如晨郵說，埃及根本談不到獨立與自治，問題只有埃及將來是屬於意大利人的，或者屬於英國人之分別面已。一般說來，大部份英人都承認這個條約的價　。英埃條約是一九三六年八月二十六日簽訂於倫敦英國外交部。</p>

<h3>譚焯宏案發生後　徐益空李泉深　認為已案敗訴　李有行賄嫌疑</h3>
<p>律師徐益、又名景賢、為富商程霖生妻室、程李恬志之姨姪婿、民國二十一年十月、徐忽偽造程李恬志及李恬志之弟李海榮、（又名泉深）委任彼為常年法律顧問之委託書一件、該契的內訂明公費為二萬兩、遂致函李恬志·李海榮、取索該項公費乃其利息、合計三萬七百餘元、而李等以並未簽訂</p>
<p>該項契約</p>
<p>遂延李時蕊（巳故）楊紹彭·律師向上海地方法院檢察處、控訴徐益偽造文書、經李芬檢察官堤起公訴、由刑庭推事譚焯宏審理、判决徐處徒刑四個月、徐奉判不服、上訴於高等法院、結果、宣告無罪、而徐另案經李泉深控於特一法院、經判處徒刑八個月、乃自譚推本與楊紹彭律師</p>
<p>要求賄賂</p>
<p>案發生後、徐益以程李恬志·李泉深、在地方法院控訴本人之案、卽由譚焯宏推事承審而李等所委任之律師、亦屬楊紹彭、且此後公訴案件、毋庸委請律師、附帶民訴、更以楊之公費竟達四千金之鉅、此項公費、實顯有行使賄賂之重大嫌疑、爰對李泉深提起共同行使賄賂之訴於</p>

<p>分文未付</p>
<p>郎李時蕊之公費六千元、我亦未付分文、而徐益之所以屢次與我等纏訟不休、實欲避免在監獄內執行徒刑之執行、而在看守所度其歲月、因看守所內所押之日、可以折抵徒刑也、現我姊李恬志現住薩坡賽路二百九十六號、胡哲庭住愛文義路七九六號、今徐所控、實無此事實、馮推事乃諭本案改期傳李恬志到案作證再訊、而徐益曾向吳縣地方法院以同樣罪名控訴胡哲庭、但現經該院裁定管轄錯誤、</p>

<h3>工部局車委　朱懋澄答問　談减少車輛內容</h3>
<p>公共租界人力車問題、自此次工部局决定於明年三月份起减少公用人力車四百八十四輛後、形勢復趨緊張、車商方面、力持反對、各界意見、亦頗紛紜、而工部局當局、對於此决减少車輛目的與辦法、似迄未有明白之表示、茲將工部局人力車務委員會朱委員懋澄與客談减少車輛內容、為節錄於下、</p>
<p>减少車輛　目的辦法</p>
<p>（客問下同）此火工部局减少車輛之目的何在、及其辦法如何、（答）現在界內所有公用人力車數量、對交通方面、暫置不論、就車夫生計而言、實屬太多、因事實上、目前車夫每班收入、除付車租外、所得極微、此為各界所公認、但如何增加其收入之方法、則不甚明瞭、須知界內全部人力車營業、每日收入、共計若干元、車輛愈多、每個車夫之收入愈少、理甚明顯、所以要增加每個車夫之收入、其合理方法之一、卽係减少現有人力車數量、同時工部局為顧念車商所受影響起見、决定於明年三月一日、從九千九百八十四輛中、僅减少四百八十四輛、以示體恤、雖車商方面稍有損失、但車夫收人、如無意外發展、得增加百分之五、</p>
<p>登記車夫不致實業</p>
<p>（問）外界謂、此决减少車輛千餘人失業、貴會有何意見、（答）此種推測、殊不正確、因照年來情形、祇有登記之車夫、方得拉車、所以無論車輛减少與吾、對未登記之車夫、原無關係、至於登記之車夫、照工部局現在計劃、决不致有失業之虞、因工部局此决决定减少車輛之數目、係於登記車夫間自然减少之範圍內行之、所謂自然减少、係指因死亡、老弱·以及改業等之原因减少之人數、其中業經證明者、工部局准予補充、惟莫由明悉者、亦不在少數、究為數幾何、明年二月間、公用人力車夫換領新照以後、卽可確定、所以在此種情形之下、車夫實無失業之顧慮、</p>
<p>並無摧殘　車商之意</p>
<p>（問）外界有謂、减少人力車、有摧殘華人經營之人力車事業及扶助外商電車及公共汽車發展之嫌、貴會又有何意見、（答）外間此種傳說、實極無稽、有識者當不致相信、蓋事實上·人力車與電車公共汽車競爭、早巳不可能、凡有電車公共汽車之處、人力車早為公衆所不樂用、尤以距離為然、例如吾人從靜安寺至外灘、就車價與時間而言、總喜歡搭公共汽車、少有僱用人力車、無論界內公用人力車數額為丸千九百八十四輛或為九千五百輛、對於此點、實無何種影饗、總之，在目前車輛供過於求之現象下、車夫勢必互相競爭顧客、結果、大家都不得一飽、所以為車夫生計着想、最好辦法、卽在車夫間自然减少之限度內、略為减少車輛、俾接近公衆所需要之數額、而人力車夫亦得享受最低限度之生活、</p>
<p>車夫互助　會之工作</p>
<p>最後、詢以人力車夫互助會之工作究竟如何、據答、近來報章對於人力車夫互助會、往往載有別界之批評、謂對於車夫、無甚好處、以致該會之眞正價値、外界無由知悉、殊屬憾事、關於此點、本人無庸加以辯正、最好各界有興趣者、自己實地前往參觀、雖然、互助會有需改良之處、但一個公正之觀察者、鑒於該會工作範圍之大、勢必認為遠東唯一之勞工福利機關、例如自本月七日至十三日一星期內、車夫到會參加會務决數計六四八三七次、其中包括赴診療所看病者三九一四人、請醫生出外看病者有二十四人、經巡迥看護服務者有一五六人、住該會醫院治療人數與日數計一五五分、送至其他醫院醫治者有三五六分、受生育輔導者一六三人、在該會學校讀書人數與日數有三一五四分、聽演講及閱圖書者有一五五五五人、給米給喪葬費等救濟會員及其家屬二七九次、會員家屬領死亡保險費者六件、沐浴人數有一三六〇二人、飲茶者有二〇〇四七人、請求調解糾紛案件有二十二件、此等工作、眞實車夫、無不表示贊同、當今年五月初、車夫個別投票贊成該會工作並表示願付會費者、在數日之問、竟有三萬人之多云云、</p>

<p>標花漲五六角　標花前市開盤、美棉仍屬平疲無勁、跌三至五磅音、印棉跌二羅比、大阪三品花漲一二角、市塲人心較緊、因紗市上進、廠方採辦原料甚殷、且產地售價不鬆、外商又來購進、市盤步步上漲、查賡豐大昶兩戶拋　甚夥、賡豐賣花買紗、大豐　記亦資、惟聚與福康長和昶明華恒益　批拖進、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三角至四角半、午後開盤、近月氣勢頗挺、且有內地商來進、　之紗市良她、至　　相依之　市、同入佳境、結果各月比上午收　、明德　千四百擔、梅記六千三百擔、大豐三千四百擔、源大二千二百擔、錦昌四千一百擔、賡豐一萬四千擔，慎昌六千二百擔、慎記七千六百担、泰昌四千六百擔、信誠二千四百擔、買進大孚九千四百擔、恒益五千一百擔聚興七千三百擔、源興昌三各九百擔、明華九千五百擔、福康一萬三千二百擔、同和七千八百擔、長和六千七百擔、長豐四千五百擔、潤　　千六百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>美棉近月尚形堅穩</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月由不動至跌二磅音、晨初市況呆滯、所有交易、大都係十月期多頭了結、移往遠期、旋以同業及利物浦帮買進、收數較減、市價回上、新戶缺乏、因週五為十月期交割通知發表之第一日也現需活動、脚地堅昂、布市較靜、將收盤時、套賣增加、大半為合作社交易、市價又跌、近月以同業買進、尚形堅穩、計現貨不動、期貨由不動至跌六磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌二三點、印棉老多頭了結、套賣奧姆辣之額為補空及同業買進所吸收、計平果爾跌一·二五　比、奧姆辣跌二羅比、白羅溪跌二·二五　　、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>

<h3>疋頭　成本增加　棉布愈覺俏利</h3>
<p>昨標紗花突然狂漲、現紗綫愈見俏利、各織廠　　棉布需　暢　、紗　　　　　、困之紗　現貨益告堅漲、棉布因成本驟增、亦一致看好、白貨東疋細布細斜猛漲、每疋五分至一角外、本廠細布·細斜·粗布升漲亦過一角左右、且均苦於無貨供給、昨本埠染廠辦進　盤日貨細布細斜三百餘件、本街及寗紹帮漢口帮辦進怡和大生振泰申暫等廠粗布細布細斜四百餘件、各廠印花起碼貢嗶嘰綫呢等貨提漲尤猛、約一二角之　、然多數廠家、因定貨交解、尚需時日、急圖減輕定貨、對於高價之現貨生意、不願接受、市勢異常堅昂、各路需貨倍覺殷切云</p>
<h3>鞋毡呢客路已發動</h3>
<p>鞋毡呢現銷路頗暢、市價挺秀、自渝蓉幫盛辦以來、申市存貨、卽見減少、新貨到申甚缺、且成本亦須加起一成有　、目下天津幫亦大有進胃、本街鞋作、金融稍裕者、刻亦預有採辦、惟貨底缺乏、花樣顏色又多殘缺不齊、以致買方頗向隅</p>
<h3>糧食　本月軋空　麵粉近遠一致昂騰</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤、各月份均見騰漲、因洋麥報價、芝加哥近漲八角零、遠漲四五角、坎拿大漲五角左右、當開價時、本月份以交割已近、交易所定廿六日為最終日期、故一般浮空、及一部分之小廠、紛起抵補、市面遂步步高升、至遠期各月份、因外行亦起而吸收、市氣亦逐步　緊、較前日各漲二三分、迨至下午開盤、本月份初開卽見提漲二分、以後則出戶甚少、空頭爭補、致形成軋空、最後竟提至三元二角六分二厘半、遠期各月份、因近期緊俏、雖廠方微有套售、依然高勝、最後結果、一致漲四五六分不等、此種價格均為最近之最高紀錄、觀察後步、因本月份人心作用、恐尚有風波云、</p>

<h3>麥價亦見大俏　本月僅提至五元〇三分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份呈近平達漲之象、因洋麥報價、仍漲四五角至八角不等、故開價時、本月份以交割已近、客戶待交之貨、廠方多不歡迎、故人心尚平、至遠期各月份、初以洋麥續振、復因期粉良好、交易雖不暢、市面則見大俏、迨至下午開盤、以粉市斷續激提、人心不免注意、故近遠各期、又漲二三分、本月份最後收盤、竟提至五元零三分、為最近之新紀錄、現麥市面、亦續趨堅俏、如山東麥已開至五元二角、洋河麥五元一角四分、次一角一分、沙河集麥五元一角半、次一角二分、瑤灣蚌埠麥五元零九分、張八嶺麥五元一角二三分、南京麥四元八角八分、漢口麥四元八角六分、次七角半、宿州麥五元零四分、湖南麥四元八角四分、蕪湖麥四元八角六分、由福新去一萬包、申大去　千包云、</p>

<h3>新陰元市況頗佳</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源較稀、計共近二十號、貨共近四千石、本街銷塲略見活絡、惟包胃青島幫僅辦　破四百餘斱略見活絡、惟包胃青島帮僅辦薄存四百餘包、故市況祇呈平定之格、厚申破行情悉無上落、而新粳及百哥稻亦皆守盤、蘆洋等新尖則因來貨較稀、去路尚可、意科已見回起數分至近角、惟中市貨猶屬平平、陳變元平庸、新陰元表勢頗佳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河埠各路來船廿八九號、市上各色交易頗佳、薄稻平淡市價破粳高貨平定、中次緊　、瓣埠客尖帶緊數分、變元價加一二角、西新粳東新粳價小　角左右、薄稻疲軟、新羊團杜尖該由秈價形無何榮辱、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子頻漲不已</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以各方進意均濃、市象續趨　緊俏、昨濟魁子開二十四元、徐魁子二十元半、中牟子十八元半、比升一元至數角不等、開產價亦逐步見企、暫乏　象、</p>
<h3>糖市　海南赤再升二角</h3>

<p>合組公司昨為本週第　次標兑粵積之期、　總定額為七千餘包、十一元四角、曲溪廠又一百二十五包、二十一元、市新廠又一百包、二十一元二角、又中砂白五十包、十九元三角、共成交九百二十包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滬絲連漲昨始回軟</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市徵有漲跌、紐約交易所生絲買賣復形淸淡、計近期較前漲一分半、遠期跌一分、橫濱則下跌五元至十元不等、里昂絲市、仍呆滯如故、申埠絲市似漸漲足而回軟、絲交仍形寂寥、白廠外銷僅怡和永與略加購進、此外七里灰經雙宮等、亦有零星購買、用戶絲市、進胃徴　、絲價亦形鬆懈、如斑馬等級前持價為六八○元、昨日約下跌五元許、卽六七五或六七二·五○元這售盤、照市可望成交、其餘普通B字、大致微跌三五元或二元半不等、昨本市內外絲銷、共成交一百○六包、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶貨缺價漲　綠茶銷路略形活動</h3>
<p>祁門紅茶、自前日英商錦隆恊和等行、大量吸收後、昨日中國茶業貿易公司汪裕泰及恊和拈孖治等行、繼續搜辦一千八九百箱、行情因缺貨之故、較前日激漲五六元、現市僅存七八百箱、整個推銷計劃、至此可謂完全實現、至綠茶市面　兩日來、亦略見活動、協和怡　同孚各　行、對於路荘珍眉針、兩項、均有進、惟因摩洛哥來價緊縮、市盤依然有跌無漲云、</p>
<p>據茶業公會報告云、日來　茶市較形活動、尤以平水眉茶、自市價平凖後、走銷頗暢、聞錦隆恊和華茶怡和均有相當擇辦、售價高荘者廿二元至廿五元、中荘者十五至　七元、低次者十三四元、共計五千七百餘箱、另色通蝦目怡和進一千五百箱、價五十三元、及同孚拆小箱大帮一帮路荘茶以怡和進秀眉較湧、價約十五六元、共進五百箱、其他抽珍恊和天祥　隆各有數十至百餘箱成交、及珍眉怡和寶隆亦各有自餘箱辦人、觀各茶售價、均為穩定云、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛定價暴漲　海外需要大増本市亦受影響</h3>
<p>靑鉛交易、寂寞已久、緣因售價太昂、買戶多改辦土鉛及舊鉛、而於洋鉛則頗少問津、惟前昨以來、市塲趨勢、頓易舊觀、海外消息、各國因西班牙戰事關係、靑鉛為製造軍火要品、故皆爭相收買、市價暴漲一鎊、每噸沽十八鎊士先令、猶少現貨、本埠同業、獲此消息、均懷居奇、市塲供少求旺、行情暴跳一元半、每擔售二十五元、而土鉛亦沽至二十三元、舊鉛廿一二元、比　均挺硬多多、　交易有二三百條、統係容帮辦去、　家僅有問津、未有開出云、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油新貨產期漸近</h3>
<p>白桐油自大跌以來、各處市面頓見消沉、漢市洋荘雖時有交易、但無大票生意、致市塲上生氣絕少、且存　不　、所謂貴物　餘也、惟洋荘欲辦現貨、行家不　　康、故有交仍須每担五十三四元洋規、聞新油拋盤自十一月份起、已做至開年一月份、價自四十七元至四十八元、已有數百噸交易、後須五十元矣、在洋行方面、對於期油與味較濃、盡在期貨上用心思、所取少數現油、價格　隨便隨取、所以各戶對於漢市現油市面、均不甚注意也、無非作點統市面觀察而已、至於浙江方面產新較早、大槪十月下旬可有新貨到申、故杭州行家連日在申拋開有三四千砠交易、價格每砠最高四十六元、惟係少數、最低為四十元係屬多數、聞現貨仍須五十二三元均是送申、但今年本埠各桐油號、已聯合一致拒絕先洋後貨、故所做交易、均是洋貨兩交、　亦鑒於往年之先洋、而解貨均不能如期、因售出亦訂有解期、賣方脫期、反欲另補抵解、受虧不少、故有聯合取締之舉也、尚有貯藏桐油洋鐵箱、亦已一律改為標準箱、則歷年重箱之弊、一旦革除、箱弊澄淸、桐油業之受益、良匪淺也、</p>

<h3>怎樣做女職員</h3>
<p>— 梅亭</p>
<p>近年來女子在社會上做事的已遂漸地增加起來，但同時不名譽的稱謂和難堪的　　也日見其普遍，一方面固然是社會輕視女性和少見多怪的稽習所造成，另一方面呢？却是在社會上做事的女子自己所招徠的。我以為女子的鑽進現社會，—男性中心社會—從他們手中奪得一個飯碗，不是可以自豪，簡直可以算是僥倖已　的事，我們是已經得到自立地位的幸運兒。我們將怎樣地立身自處呢？這是值得討論的一個功身問題。</p>
<p>女職員之所以為社會垢病，當然有令人不滿意的地方，除掉因生理關係不及男子，因此使人不滿而無法避免之外，我以為男女平等既又同樣收受所得的薪給，那麼你也應該帶你的能力去做你本分以內而又和同事平等的工作。這是女職員絕對應守的一個規律。至於工作範圍之內，因別種人事而引起不名譽的舉動，也應絕對避免。那麼「花瓶」的雅號，自然不會輸到你們的頭上來了。</p>
<p>同時女職員，也有一種很普遍的惡習，就是「遲到早退」，這話雖不能一概而論。但事實告訴我們，在考勤簽到伊們祇認為虛應故事，而並不嚴厲執行的辦公處所裏女職員的遲到早退，已成為當保守儉樸，（雖然也有因營業上的關係，不得不濃裝艷抹，但這是例外）。倘使以自己的美麗而想博得同事或公司主事者的歡心，那無異是在出賣自己的肉體，根本失去了女職員本身的任務和使命。這最容易被人看不起的最大原因</p>
<p>至於關於工作範圍以內的別種人事而引起不名譽的舉動，也應絕對避免。所謂別種人事，當然很多，如同事的變愛等，都足以影響到個人的名譽，雖然戀愛是人生不能抛開的，但我們應該認清戀愛是鼓勵人生事業的一種藥劑，不能沉緬於中或放縱戀愛，以致毀壞了身的事業。其他像用惡劣的手段去引誘男同事替代自己的工作而不上辦公廳等，這是最不好的一種普遍行為，也亟宜加以糾正才是。</p>
<h3>法國巾幗英雄若安達克的生平</h3>
<p>— 曹逸女士</p>
<p>法國最出名的女子，個個人都曉得是羅蘭夫人，倒忘記了十五世紀時一個損軀救國的女子，這女子就是若安達克。</p>
<p>達克是一個村農的女兒，幼時，每天散了學，就幫助父親在田裏做工；晚上就坐在母親身邊紡棉紗，直到夜深。屋邊有一帶小樹林，鄰家小孩子們，都常常聚在那裏跳　歌唱，達克有時也加入他們當中同玩。就是樹林中的飛禽走獸，也是伊的好朋友；小雀子一點不怕伊，總是跑來落在伊肩上。聽說伊還可以喚野獸出來玩。就世情而論伊是一個天真爛漫的村姑，伊最喜歡聽禮拜常的鐘聲，也喜歡服侍同村的病人。</p>
<p>當一四二九年的時候，伊已是十八歲了。那時候法王却爾司正受英人的攻擊，法兵一天天的敗退，英軍一寸寸的前進，舉國都惶恐極了！正在這個危急的當兒，達克一天躺在床上，忽見一個神人，向伊出現，吩咐伊去見法王，恢復法國的威權；伊道：「我不過是一個農人的女兒，並不會帶兵打仗」神人道：「上帝會幫助你。」達克便去見法王却爾司，說道：「天主命我對你說，你一定可以恢復你的威權，做天主的神將，統制法國」。法王歡呼道：「天主差遣你來，請你帶着我的大軍前去殺敵吧！」達克帶兵上了戰場，全身穿着雪白的盔甲，一手握法國百合花，英勇極了，伊生得很長大，騎在馬上，如同男子一樣；在馬上終日不吃什麼，也不覺得疲倦。伊帶着數萬的戰士，如同母親帶着一　小孩子一樣；到了戰地，伊揮着手高聲呼道「殺敵吧！不要怕！」將士門聽見了這句話，頓時增加了勇氣，衝殺過去，果然大敗敵人：敵人退到堡中，達克率着將士攻堡，忽然受了傷，跌在地上，軍士們就喪了氣，預備退兵，達克　然爬了起來！喊着道：「等着！此時稍為休息；你們若是瞧着我這面旗子觸着了敵人的城墻，你們就奮勇進攻！」於是大勝，伊達了城堡就跑到禮拜堂去謝上帝。</p>
<p>戰事完畢，大功告成了。達克要求法王放伊回家，法王不允。這時英人既大敗，就蓄意復仇，達克仍然奮勇交戰，但是伊不幸被一個惡人名呌巴士達的捉住了。他將伊賣結英人，英人把伊當作一個行妖的婦人，關在牢裏，整整有一個年頭。後來硬誣伊是一個妖婦，定了一　　死的罪，於是把伊帶到大街中間，用粗繩子將伊縛住，下面堆起柴來，達克很沉靜的舉首向天，放聲呼道：「英人！英人！恐怕將來你們要因我的死，受無限痛苦啊！喊聲未已，無　的火，烈熖飛騰的燒起來了。</p>
<p>達克女士死了！伊為國家犧牲了！喚醒了全法國人的熱血！恢復了法國的　土！</p>
<p>目前的中國，恐怕比十五世紀的法國，還要危險，但是中國的婦女，全忘記了達克女士的奮　精神，還是醉生夢死的過伊們舒服的日子。我親愛的姊妹呀！我們的末日到了！醒醒吧！效法達克女士的精神，救我們這危亡國家！</p>

<h3>嶺南三英熊璧雙耀雙佩雙姊妹印象記</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>科學能救國，藝術也能救國；既是中國人，應為中國效命！</p>
<p>嶺南熊璧雙，燿雙，佩雙三女士，名震藝林，幸得黨國要人們的推許，更是聲價十倍。本來在現階段中，無論什麼學術專家，要是靠個人的力量決計不能增高你的地位，非得顯貴名流的吹扇，一輩子也不能露頭　的。藝術這樣東西，原是最高貴的，最超然的，試問現時的藝術家有那幾人是靠本領成名的？更有幾人不是專靠達貴顯要提拔而成名的？換句話說，藝術的造詣，的確要有相當功力，　能享受相當的盛名，這是理所該然的，還有技巧平庸而坐擁虛名的，我們自然不敢恭維了。像嶺南二英，去年奉汪精衛先生之命，到京展覽作品，我想未曾目睹的人，對於她們的藝術，難免發生疑問，這是人之常情，不足為怪。前天他們姊妹　人，聯袂蒞滬，我為好奇心驅使前往訪問，首先展閱她們的作品，凡花卉，翎毛，人物，各別的或合作的，欣賞過新作十餘幅，使人折服，認為功力之深，不同凡響，所謂瓣香南田，得其神髓；以三姊妹這樣輕的年齡，而有好麼好的成績，所以能得要人們的賞識，初非偶然。</p>
<p>她們原籍番禺，父親前是清舉人，兪曲園先生的及門弟子。熊氏有姊妹發人，兄弟三人，璧雙行二，與兩妹在廣州執信女學讀書時，汪精衛氏曾教授文學課程，孫哲生朱家驊兩氏為校董，所以他們　師生之誼。後來升入香港大學文科，前年夏同級畢業，三人初習洋畫，後改國畫，得高奇峯，容仲生，張　初　氏指導，十餘年來，藝乃大進。她們去年到了首都，曾開過一次展覽會，今年五月又開出國預展會，這幾天要在上海再開一次出國預展會，地點及日期，由市政府代定，會後回粤，便定期　洋，先到新加坡及南洋各要埠，展覽出品，再直放德國，　赴英法各邦，明年　美，繞道日本回國，為期一年，她們這回是奉教育部令，考察歐美各國藝術，順便展覽出品，對外宣揚中國的藝術，一方面想多多吸收點西洋繪畫的作風和技術。</p>
<p>「考察歐美回國以後，將怎樣努力你們的前程」？我提出了疑問。</p>
<p>「我們的計劃，想回國後在粤籌辦一所女子美術學院，養成新進的人才，目前廣州只有一所市立美術專科學校，專為女子設立的，國內也沒有；中央方面，有很多人表示同情，此番回粤，將先與省市當局作初　接洽，除此以外，沒有第二計劃」</p>
<p>「你們三姊妹的志願都一樣麼」？</p>
<p>雙脫　「是呀！我們　人所學相同，志趣相同，努力的目標，當然也相同了」。</p>
<p>「照此說來，你們真是三位一體了。」於是大家笑了一陣。</p>
<p>「正當你們出國的時候，而國難益見緊張，敢問對此作何感想？」</p>
<p>佩雙說：「我們年紀太輕，只知道畫幾筆畫，那敢侈談國事。不過美術這　東西，是很可以代表民族性的，科學能救國，藝術也能救國但方法微有不同而已。從」九一八」國難以後，我們也有許多作品，表現救國主義的，其中如「脊令在原」，「喬木嚶鳴」，「鴻雁來實」……都是國難抒情之作，曾引起大家的注意。</p>
<p>「你們三姊妹平素對於婦女問題有些什麼意見」？</p>
<p>這一個問題，三人都有意見發表，後來璧雙把它歸納起來，又說了一遍：「婦女至少要佔全民族的半數，既同為中國的人，應同樣負起救中國的責任。救國從何救起呢？這就不是三言兩語所可概括的。以我們三姊妹而言，惟有從本身做起，訓練自己的才能，充實自己的學識；站在美術作者的立場，負起本位救國的責任。此行除考察藝術之外，當留意各國婦女的長處，帶回來給我們女同胞作參考。</p>
<p>我們正談推門入室，握手為禮，對記者說：「……小女等雖久居港粤，遠游京滬，而且大學畢業，依然未染都市習氣，能保持忠厚誠懇的態度，聊以自慰。現在重臨繁華都市，她們原就是孤陋寡聞，簡直同鄉下人游城隍廟一樣，都要前輩先生的指導。她們除了讀書學畫之外，不問外事，不懂交際，此次出國，給她們機會，知道東西洋文化事業的新趨勢。……」</p>
<p>同懷三姊妹，奉派出國，漫游歐美，考察藝術，這在中國婦女運動史上，的確是很光榮的一頁。不過西方諸國的習俗，和我國多少有些不同，例如交際酬應的禮貌，健康活潑的天性，尤其是女子，應加注意；熊氏三英的藝術作品，已臻上乘，可是還不脫閨秀柔弱的氣息，見了人好像羞人答答的，身體似乎瘦削，在西洋人看來，也許要誤解中國女子還是有此病態美呢。</p>
<h3>熊氏三姊妹及其簽名</h3>
<h3>世界婦女名人傳（五）</h3>
<p>— 魯沙白</p>
<p>現在蘇聯女政治家中最傑出的可算是厄列拿。多米特利復娜。斯塔索未。自柯倫泰和克魯普斯卡耶　沒落後，尼古萊夫，卡魯依基那還未露頭角的時候，她已從事革命　爭　有三十六年，現任國際救濟會的主席，在國際上很有聲望。</p>
<p>三十六年的　爭過程中，從列寧以至斯太林，她在蘇聯的黨史上幾乎佔了半面。從十九世紀末「火花」創刋時起，她常參畫黨中的一切機密，在蘇聯革命的元老中她可以算是僅有的一個。</p>
<h3>斯塔索夫</h3>
<p>她看來是一個女梭長的典型，人極嚴肅，對事業異常熱心，工作是她的生命。她不像一般的政治家那樣假公濟私，也從沒有因為感情的作用牽涉到政治的關係無論政治上的傾向如何，她總能順應潮流，忠於她的職務。</p>
<p>第一次革命　時在諾弗哥羅車站被捕，被關進莫斯科塔甘　斯克監獄，第二次革命時　被處流刑，後逃至彼得堡，與莫洛托夫等組織　中央黨部，即請伊里奇　前往主持。革命成功後，在第六屆黨大會上　被選為中央候補委員，第七及第八次大會上選為中央委員。一千九百二十年，在馬厙舉行的第一屆　東方民族會議上，但任指導。一九三三年清黨時，任清黨委員。現任國際濟難會長，在職已六年不斷和全世界　的白色恐怖相　爭，熱心地救助全世界被壓迫　的人類，去年正當　她六十誕長，全蘇聯都　向她熱烈祝賀</p>
<h3>婦女的家庭消遣法</h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>加拿大，溫古華的哥倫比亞婦女俱東部，成立已有十餘年，擁有會員約四千稍弱。該俱樂部，不只具有着設備完備的會所，以給與會員們以生活的便利，以及體育與道德的修養，同時，更　意於一般婦女的家庭生活的設計。該會於今年春間，聘請着對於婦女家族生活夙有研究的專家十二人，從事於研究適於一般婦女的家族生活。該十二位專家，計加拿大人三人，美國三人，英國及其他屬地的四人，留美的華僑一人，法人一人。經了四個月的縝密的討論，與交換意見，一致公認着下列數項，是最適宜於婦女在業餘或料理家政之餘的家庭消遣。</p>
<p>（一）毛缐棉缐等的編織。如帽，披肩，外衣，檯毯等等</p>
<p>（二）刺繡。如衣服，鞋帽上的一切圖案，以至於窗帘，沙發枕，檯布手套等上面，所需各式圖案的刺繡。</p>
<p>（三）蒔花。家宅旁的庭園隙地，都可利用而為蒔花的好去外。每天灌溉栽培，以便花開時，作家庭案供之用。</p>
<p>（四）佈置家室中的傢具，雜物，使美觀而整潔。</p>
<p>（五）豢養家畜，及家禽，以增加家庭中的生氣。</p>
<p>（六）提倡戶內運動，如柔軟操，及檯球之類，使每一婦女，每天有若干時的運動，不特可增進健康，并可調節人體內血溶液的特環，而使容貌美麗。</p>
<p>關於第（一）（二）項，該會將更羅請若干針織與刺繡專家，長期的編製教本，并繪製一切新型設計的圖案，刋成專冊，或在該會刋，與加拿大及美國的若干婦女雜誌上，發表以供一般婦女採用。第（三）（五）項，該會也將聘用若干專家，撰文而介紹一切合外語家庭栽植的花，草，樹，木，以及合於家庭豢養的禽，魚，鳥，獸。該俱樂部會員，有免費而獲得函詢或面詢的機會。預定一年之後，若成績優良，該俱東部，尙擬再擴充而聘請若干家庭指導員，以備會員招往家庭中指導之用。第（五）項的提倡，除編印小冊，指導一般婦女以佈置與整理的常識與原理之外，尙擬聘請專家三人或四人，作定期的公開演講，以及供會員們諮詢之用。第（六）項項，除作文字的提倡之外，尙擬編印掛圖，及攝製幻燈與活動電影等，向會員宣導，關於上述六項，所需的工具，原料，以及種子等等，該俱樂部，除自備一部，以供會員購和外，同時，更特約若干有關於商店，以相當的價值，出售於該會會，以資便利。</p>
<p>除上述的六項之外，該十二位研究委員，尚設計有戶外的消遣法若干條，如（一）假期中的旅行，（二）划船，（三）駕駛汽車，（四）騎乘自行車，（五）攝影……等等，一因限於篇幅，二因我國婦女，尙未達相當的程度，所以從略。—關於這些戶外活動，該俱樂部，也將聘請若干負責的指導員，給與會員們以種種的便利。</p>
<p>我國的婦女，在家庭中，是毫無娛樂可言的。所有的業餘時間，或處理家務的餘晷，便幾乎完全消費在頹廢的生活之中。一方面，即說不讓陶治性情與德行，一方面，又說不上有益衛生，或尋求興趣。在這種頹廢的生活中生活的婦女，除了養成暴躁的性情，狹小的自我，以破裂着家庭的愉快之外，實在是沒有較好的結果，可以產生的了。所以在這裏我特地介紹一些專家們，對於家庭生活的設計方案，給讀者。我希望我國的婦女界，速從頹廢生活中，跳出來，去追求着合理的家庭生活。</p>
<h3>闊別十年的大姊（上）</h3>
<p>— 李守真</p>
<p>這次暑期回到家裏，偶然的機會碰到了蘋的大姊，假使不是她一看見我就驚喜地喚出我的小名，她那憔悴的容顔和那不合時宜裝束，幾乎使我完全的認不來是誰了，我那裏會想到當年那麼美好嬌麗而又頂愛整潔的大姊，不到十年就會改變到這個樣子呵！</p>
<p>當我看見了這是她時，也就連忙的跑向她去，她還是和以前一樣的怪新熱的拉住我的手問我這幾年來的情形，於是我告訴她我自本縣的初中畢業了後，就到上海去進高中，後來就接着進大學，現在是大學也已經畢業，而且在做事了。她聽了我的話，像是無限感慨的嘆了口氣說：「呵，你們這些小孩子是都　進了，蘋現在也在上海，你有空去看看她吧！她的生活也不如你呢，常常寫信來訴　她的孤寂和精神的不痛快，現在她已是兩個孩子的母親了，雖然小家庭的生活還美滿，可是自也沒有自己的事業和前途，總是非常空虛的。從前你們是多麼好的一對呵，現在也就各自東西各人走各人的路了」。說着在她那兩顆曾經為許多人贊美的大眼睛上表露着無限抑　，最後她告訴了我蘋在上海的地址，就說家裏孩子有病，怱怱的走了。</p>
<p>當她那背影像秋天的落葉般從我的眼前逝去時，我竟忽忽如有所失！</p>
<p>不過是十年前吧？那時我還只十三歲，在本地的初中一念書，蘋和我是在小學裏就同學的，我們不但是同年，而且兩個人的身段和性情都差不多，不知道的人總以為我們是同胞姊妹，而我們也就從來都像同胞姊妹一般的要好的。那時蘋的大姊在我們學校的附小教書，她不但有很好的教育法，國文很好，而且她還是特具音樂和手工的天才的；況且她又是年輕貌美，活潑和氣，所以當地的社會是公認她為典型的新女性的。在學校裏憑她那悠場的歌喉，和溫柔的性情，使每個小學生都繞在她的周圍，而她那特有的仁慈和大度，更是連校裏的工役們都是非常的感恩她的。</p>
<p>每到冬天，蘋總是穿她那新的毛缐衣，套着新的手套，興高采烈地跑到學校裏來，誇耀她的大姊對她的友愛，而夏天她大姊又給她做那當時最時髦的翻領短衣，同學們都非常的羨慕她，而我呢，大姊總會每年送我一雙手套，或一條圍中的，所以也像煞比別的同學要幸福些</p>
<p>可是舊禮教和社會的習慣，是不容許一個年紀經上了二十歲的女孩子，還留在她母親身邊的，蘋的大姐已經是上了二十歲的女孩子，所以她們的父母們就開始了焦急，因這盡善美的愛女，而找不到一個盡善美的快婿而煩悶，於是向四處發出了擇婿的消息，四處未婚男兒，都想來求這佳偶了。終經有一個早晨，蘋滿臉歡笑的跑來告訴我她的父母已得了大姊的同意，而替她訂婚了。</p>
<p>那年的寒假，我回到鄉間等到開學回來時，蘋碰見我第一句話就說她的大姊已經出嫁了。並且她已經辭去了附小的教職，預備和她的丈夫一同去上海了，從此我就沒有再見大姊，而蘋也很少的出她的消息，直到後來蘋提起嫁而我們也斷了消息。</p>
<h3>職業女子訪問所得：（二）　新亞酒店女職員的思想與生活</h3>
<p>— 賢影</p>
<p>還有進一步的相同點即：</p>
<p>（一）她們皆可代表中產階級家庭中清白高尙的女子。</p>
<p>（二）智識方面皆具有初中畢業的低一年或高一年的受過　過公民教育的資格的。</p>
<p>（三）沒有一發不良嗜好，更無下流荒唐行為，工作很　責，對職位很滿意，能自愛自檢的善良公民。</p>
<p>除了上述六點的相似情形外，我還想對個人有一個特寫瑪琍—一位中西合璧的寗馨兒，矮小身材，飽滿精神，比之於悲劇明星西爾維薛德耐，並不說謊，從小在外國學校念書，說得一口無疵的英語，舉止活潑，對答流利。</p>
<p>玉屏—同事中學問最優的一位，做過教員寫一手好字，歡喜運動，充學校籃球隊長，出過風頭，很天真，走路有特別姿勢，臉作蛋形，中等身材，她歡喜學駛飛機，對人說可惜沒有機會。</p>
<p>佩儀—是一個小孩，但年齡却最大，歡喜游泳，舌尖太短，發音不準確，很用功，在補習英文。</p>
<p>秀珍—一位女子社會運動家，她的慈愛心，像她的肥胖的身體一樣發達，曾賠過本錢辦平民夜校，現在還兼任護務學校的教導主任，布衣布鞋，篤信耶教。</p>
<p>秀琴—年齡最輕，但很能幹，能駛電梯，也能司中菜，會說蘇州話也會說上海話，尤其是她節儉本領更能幹，據說二角小洋一場電影是不捨得去的。</p>
<p>照她們所有的相似點，很可代表現代職業女子中的大多數人了—中產階級，普通智識，二十幾歲，四五十元一月。所以我僅僅對他們五個人的訪問，想信很能說出一斑職業女子的生活與思想種種，下面我舉出七大問題，且看她們所給我的答案。</p>
<p>（一）關於職業方面：</p>
<p>A你接受你現在職業的目的，是為了甲與趣乙金錢丙務社會丁為了生活太空閒。答案是三個說為了金錢二個說為了服務社會。</p>
<p>B理想中所希望的職業與薪水，與除現業外是否參加其他社會運動？答案是：</p>
<p>希望的職業　希望的薪水　參加其他社會運動否？</p>
<p>瑪琍　現任　五十元</p>
<p>玉屏　勞工　五十元</p>
<p>佩儀　　　愈多愈好</p>
<p>秀珍　教員　五十元　青年會義務學校</p>
<p>秀琴　書記　四五元</p>

<p>精中帶血</p>
<p>第三十號，西門路永裕里八十一號陳榮泉君問：敝人為劣友所誘，宿娼一次，白濁淋漓，痛苦異常。閱報載「梅毒尅星」治淋，買了服下，淋濁確已（？）全愈！近日偶閱邪書，手術一次，所出的精液有血混入，色帶赭色。其他並無症狀此是何病？（二）用何法治療，吃何種藥品？（三）日後對於身體有害否？</p>
<p>答：（一）是『精囊炎』。（二）按摩，冷水浴，注射『果能克淋』Sino-Acrindin，及『新亞鈣劑』（Sinocalcin）。以上除冷水浴外，非假手醫師不為功。（三）於生育發生問題。</p>
<p>雙腳腫賬</p>
<p>第二十一號，夏安之君問：敝人年十八歲，在十六歲就棄學就商，故缺乏運動，少受日光熏晒，發育倒還完全，身體亦頗長大，前年底洗腳，發覺雙腳踝凹處微腫，也不在意，去春忽更覺浮腫，故即向大南門〇〇〇堂藥局購腳腫丸五盒，服後並未發生何效力，去就中醫〇〇〇醫師打針，亦未能除去此浮腫。因聞說是腎虧而起，此病服食甲魚有消腫之能，故聽而食了四五只，亦未有甚變化，今春閱書知缺乏『維地命B』所致，故即向糧食店購那米皮糠，食後覺腫減去不少。現敝人請問：（一）此病究因何故而促成？（二）用何種藥品能根本除去？（三）指示那幾種攝生，表明手術（？）？（四）敝人痰極多，服何藥除去此病？</p>
<p>（一）有兩種病能有此種病狀，即腳氣及心臟性水腫，閣下是何病，診查後方知。腳氣之原因為缺乏『維他命B4』，同時被細菌感染。（三）請醫注射『退惡水』（Theosal）即能全消，但如係腳氣，非兼服『維他命B』不可（Vitamin-B）。（三）少走路，多休息，不喫米飯，專喫麵和菜蔬，既然吃糠有效，不妨直喫下去，（四）服『百咳定』（Pacdin）片，一日三次，每次二片。</p>
<p>痰中帶血</p>
<p>第三十二號，南市小南門外秀水浜十三號黃世熙君問：敝人今年二十一歲，在去年五月中忽然痰中帶有紅血少許，但後來未嘗有過。時常頭目暈眩，身體乏力。至六月後喉忽音啞，至今聲音全無，百藥無效。至九月照了X光後，方　知道有患肺病。請問：（一）喉嚨無音與肺病有關否？若是有關係則何原因？（二）喉無音能否再有回復聲音之希望？（三）用何法治療為宜，常服何藥？</p>
<p>答：（一）失音由於喉頭結核。肺痛則學名為『肺結核』，其關係之密切，顧名思義，不言可知。（二）非得極適當之療法，難望全愈。（三）藥物療法，注射『鈣固神』（Calchosen），內服『新亞鈣劑』（Sinocalcin）片及『魚亞鈣劑』。營養療法，喫自已所愛喫的東西。日光療法，每日清晨在陽光晒胸部二十分鐘。氣胸術。</p>
<p>鉛毒腹痛</p>
<p>第三十三號，愛多亞路民生印刷所程蔭瑞君問：敝人年二十三歲。自四年前即服務本印刷局，任排字工作，任職以後不到半年，就常常肚子痛，痛得如刺如絞，臍底下好像有一硬塊。痛的時候頭暈眼花，面白如紙，渾身汗珠就像雨點般的滾下來。故請問（一）是什麼病？（二）請先生診治好否？（三）怎樣治法？（四）是否『盲腸炎』？</p>
<p>答：（一）『慢性鉛中毒』，又名『鉛毒痛』，此由於君在不知不覺之中吸入鉛屑，集少成多。在體內作祟所致。操排字業者多患本病。（二）不必一定請余診治，正式新醫，醫療本病，都有十分把握。（三）注射五%『氯化鈣』一針能立即止痛，數針可以全愈。（四）不是。</p>

<h3>減少人力車輛問題</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>人力車在這時候，真可以算得倒霉之至了。不久以前，為了限制公用人力車的數目增加，和限制人力車登記的名額，接二連三的無妄之災都落到他們的頭上來，使他們這最低度的生活也不能在流盡了血汗的情況下維持。現在，他們空前的難關又來到了，那便是租界當局減少人力車車的建議。這問題很快地蔓延了開來，連車主也受到了威　，感着利害不安了。</p>
<p>本來，在所謂不景氣的浪潮下面，裁員減薪是一件很普遍的事。因此，有人也以為養活人力車輛，也不過是人力車這一行業的裁削，而把這當成了一件很普通的事。我們以為把這問題這樣看法，是不妥當的。和裁員減薪這些事件有沒有相同的地方，且不要去說他，單說減少人力車輛的出發點是為了現代文明的人們，覺得人力車是落後的，不「人道」的，這個廢止人力車的原則看來，我們已覺得和前者不能一概而論了。這是「淘汰」，不是單純地為了人力車這一行業的不景氣。</p>
<p>現在，我們試討論一下，這樣「淘汰」是否妥當的方法這一個題目把吧。當然，在二十世紀這樣機械工業已很發達的時代，來主張淘汰這種「非人道」的，還是人驅使人的舊東西，那是怪不得的，不過，如果單是覺得「要不得」，便從「減少」，「限制」等入手，而企圖把人力車完全消滅，這却是不很委當了。在過去人力車　的糾紛時，　如限制登記的糾紛，如籌　人力軍夫　利會，等等　我曾經這樣地說過，一　們要整個地決解人力車夫的風潮，應該　從他們的生活解決入手，因此，幾次的人力車夫的騷動，「最大的原因，還是沒有注意到人力車夫本身的痛苦」。現在，我們又看到了人車車夫向工部局大請願的新聞了。他們請願的主旨，還不外是：（一）改組人力車夫互助會：（二）取消車夫登犯限制；（三）打消減少車輛議案。從這裏我們看到幾目前的人力車夫的問題，雖然算是已告段落，但到底還沒有澈底解決，問題還是存在着，而且依舊是那末嚴重。減少車輛的問題，不過是以前諸問題的延續罷工，而且這一次連車主的利益也有了影響，問題便更顯得複雜了。</p>
<p>最近，對於這一問題還沒有看到什麼結果。不過，我們有一個很微小的希望。那便是請求一般主張根本廢止人力車的先生們，稍為注意一下那被廢止了以後的那數萬以上的人力車夫們，他們的生活將會怎樣？當然，他們現在那非人的生活是應該救濟的，但救濟的方法決不是廢止了便得到復好的結果。人力車被廢止，無疑地便是使他們失業，那時候他們的生活，却連「非人生活」也比不上了。因此，我們非常希望，這一次的減少人力車輛的問題會有一個很澈底的辦法。</p>
<h3>談嚮導</h3>
<p>— 史淮子</p>
<p>美國影片中，以嚮導為主角的戲是很過幾張的，（記得起來的如「明月香衾」）結果也總是一般美國的戀愛影片那樣：男嚮導員得了一個美麗而多情（有時候還多金）的嬌妻。在中國，情形便似乎有些不同，嚮導社在現在，雖大有風起雲湧之勢，然而男嚮導員可一個也沒有，——或許是有的吧？不過我可始終沒在廣告上見到過。——即使有了，我想也不見得會有人去請教。至於女嚮導員呢，請她們去「嚮導」的則大都是久住在上海的洋行職員，什麼機關的小科員以及大學生之流，呌她們嚮導的也是「嚮導」饅頭如何喫法這一類事情。（見大晚報一個女嚮導員的自白）這批人生下地來好像便不曾喫過饅頭似的。</p>
<p>起先我不大明白此中的原因，祇是以為嚮導事業的能如此發達者，那大概是由於上海是中外觀瞻所在的通商大埠；但知道了所謂嚮導原來還得嚮導饅頭如何喫法這一類事情，我又以為嚮導事業能如此發達，原來是「嚮導」之外還得兼職「保姆」。</p>
<p>但這個自以為近乎正確的「以為」，又給報紙上的分類廣告打破了。有一家在廣告上說，「良宵寂寞更長，伴君消愁解悶；」又一家說，「國色天香何處有？花容月貌此地尋，」大概還怕人家不相信，所以把「花容月貌」的照片也製版刋出，以昭大信。至於以「慷慨」OK為名，以及由「貌艷如花的女職員自備有刺戟性興奮性的紀念品分贈各界」來號召的，那更是普遍得很，嘸啥希奇。</p>
<p>嚮導而要「國色天香」「花容月貌」來作號召，這理由已經夠深奧了，何況還有刺戟性興奮性的紀念品。但是如果把「良宵寂寞更長，伴君消愁解悶，」來作為「嚮導」的注解大概也並不十分錯。</p>
<p>因為是「伴君消愁解悶」，「花容月貌」之外，了解迎合「顧客心理」，自然也更成為一個條件，所以有一家的廣告便說，「有專家訓練社員應對」，「有專家管理社員化裝」，「有專家研究顧客心理」由這麼多的「專家」訓練這下，「社員」們出來應徵，自然是「使君得了愛不忍釋」。</p>
<p>小市民們在這個苦難的年代，需要一點「刺戟」來麻醉一下靈魂，已經不足把們指斥一頓就能使他們改得過來的事情，而一切東西需要一件漂亮的外衣來作為護符，也正為他們所了解，雖然，漂亮的外衣所掩飾的睚是墮落的道路，然而這墮落的道路却是用生活來支撐的，所以「風化」等等動聽的名詞，對它都不能發生效力，至多，那件漂亮的外衣破了，另外再換一件，而骨子裏却還是一樣，說不定還更可怕。</p>
<p>因之，我所擔心的倒不是風化先生們的痛哭流涕，而是這病象支持不了多久，那時候，要找刺戟來麻醉靈魂的小市民們已經力不從心了。所以也用不到再指斥他們，一切漂亮的外衣已經失去了他誘惑的力量，而總崩潰的一天便也到了。</p>
<p>我對這樣的現象雖然怕見他，然而却很希望他來，因為我知道，他是遲早會來的，任何力量都阻擋不了他。</p>
<p>而在腐爛的後面，新的光明便將用這些屍首作為肥料，開出燦爛的花朶來。</p>
<h3>孩子（續）</h3>
<p>— 休羊</p>
<p>我就那樣地教育着我的孩子。</p>
<p>但是孩子在今年春初害了場大病，我初次用二十四塊錢的代價請一個醫生來開藥方。孩子病了兩個月，醫藥費用去了我四個月的薪金。我的母親每天在觀音像前來拜，祇要孩子病好，什麼犧牲都是在所不惜的。但是我終覺得這犧牲是太大了。在孩子最危險的那個晚上，母親無意間說是前世欠了他的債，那末他也是「討債」來的了。生孩子是「還債」，這話含着深長的意味，至少我個人是這樣想。</p>
<p>孩子病好起來了，直到他痊愈起床，他幾乎完全變了，雖然還保持特有的倔強底性格。他放棄了一切孩子們所歡喜的東西，他已經並不是一個「博愛主義者」底「好玩的孩子」了。他沉默，寡笑，像大人們過到不如意事的時候一樣，一個六歲的孩子彷佛一個六十歲的老人。我很不高興他的銀幕作風，我用了更大的努力想恢復他的天真，但是沒有用，直到現在母親還說他是「富貴相」，「大難不死，必有後福」的。</p>
<p>我的教育却是失敗了！</p>
<p>在孩子生病的時候，妻又懷了孕。母親自然很是歡喜，她計算着分娩的時期，又用種種「相」法推測那未來的小生命是男是女。和母親同年齡的做母親的因為我的大孩子「大難不死」，而今年又有添丁之喜，大家討論「兒女」與「福氣」常常是充滿了笑聲的。</p>
<p>在妻生產之前，有一天在燈下母親突然向我喜歡生男還是生女？孩子既是「討債」來的，那末管他生男生女，我可乾脆地回答母親生什麼都好。但是母親是抱着一團高興來問我的，我也是母親底「討債」的孩子，自然應該先猜測她喜歡生男還是生女。於是我這樣回答了她：</p>
<p>「生男孩子自然更好，但是也應該有一個女孩子。」</p>
<p>這答話正合了母親的本意，雖然明知道這是最滑頭的答覆。一家人在喜悅中等候着妻的臨盆。</p>
<p>前天晚上，妻臨盆了，生了個男孩，但是三分鐘便死去了。這多少使母親不高興，她自然更寶貴她底「必有後福」的大孫兒了。</p>
<p>我像妻沒有懷孕沒有生孩子一樣，我已經「還」清了一筆「債」反感到無上的偷快。但是瞧着大的孩子始終那樣的「少年老成，」我又悲哀起來，我不知怎樣來教育這個「債權人」了</p>
<p>雖然母親是喜歡那種沉默寡笑的「富貴相」的。</p>

<h3>省道上</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—此和雜碎</p>
<p>携了不安定的心情，從黑牙子衝出了狼羣的突襲，至少，該說得上是無上的幸運。然而，不能因為這就使心情安定下去，想到不遠的那一個所在——據說與九盤子有同等的險要的地方，止不住的，心就會跳。不知在怎麼樣的一個塲合，思索塗上了些許的寬縱——</p>
<p>——更深夜靜的時候，也許不會像所傳說的那麼可怕吧？</p>
<p>聽着車輪摩擦着碎殘的路面，聽着山谷里投過來把風聲的回響：月色薄掩了浮雲，山野里依舊把持了混沌的輪廓。以速率比擬一下，從開車的地方到現在，約計着將有五里路了，人跡麼？哼，連鬼跡也找不到。</p>
<p>之後，還是那個司機的人開了話：</p>
<p>——要是孤單的行旅在夜間走上這條路，那眞該死！說話的意思，我們都很明瞭。可是，他忽略了事實，公路的汽車旣經通行了，那孤單的行旅，又何必去趕夜路呢？</p>
<p>——但這條路上，却照樣要有人走動吶！我搭了一句：趕塲的小商人，不是仍舊要頂了星斗趕上迢迢地夜路麼？</p>
<p>——自然，但那物是不值什麼錢，為了「地邊路熟」，說不定被劃為額外的界限，卽使不然，把懷里的傢伙拔出來，單槍對匹馬，也可以對打個多少回合！</p>
<p>「傢伙」？「對打」？念頭急遽的轉了幾下，想到山路揹里客的那個布袋子，緊緊地纏在腰間，里面彷彿有什麼東西，起初，自己總以為不過裝點乾糧，現在，更知道除了乾糧以外，還有能够「對打」的「傢伙」。生活，本來是採取不同方式的，在沒有脫離原始生活的山國里，也正有適應他們自我的方式。</p>
<p>由於這，問題解決了，能「對」的時候就「對」，假使不能，就逃亡以至犧牲。如果遇見的不是人，而是另外的一羣，原則上也是「同樣辦理」的。</p>
<p>走着，走着漸次的我們又上了沉昏的睡鄉。突的，當整個的車子頓了兩下以後，又停了，司機抬一下旁邊的小劉，用了警告的口吻！</p>
<p>當心呵，前面！</p>
<p>距離五方尺遠的路上，平整的睡了兩個人，說睡，那當然不確實的，為什麼要躺在路當中？為什麼又在緊要的所在？用不到多說，神經刺激我們想到另一條路上去。於是，阿黃拿出了傢伙，——兩個人，好對付，除非他們不來！</p>
<p>終於，那兩個人起來了，緩慢的走過來，作着長揖，面色是青灰的，頭上的那塊包中，已經滾斜到一邊去。樣子，是個趕塲的小商人，但，担子和背架，却一樣也看不見。</p>
<p>——求大先生可憐一回吧，他們發話了，聲音悲苦的，我們是兩兄弟，預備到黑神廟趕塲，哼，趕屁，整筐子的鹽粑都被搭去了。頓了一下，回家，怎樣交代呢？想到札佐，近一點息烽也好，向親戚借些貨物或是錢，可是，路途那樣的遙遠，乾糧不容許我們能這樣的作去，很遠的看見燈光，才躺下來找求救星，請大先生准許我們搭乘吧！最後，他們哭了，樣子逼眞的。</p>
<p>我們相信，絕不是神經過敏，一個懷叵測的人，常會用種種地方法，來謀取最後的目的，對於這突發的事件，當然不能馬虎的譽應下來，經過再三的盤問，才接受了他們的請求。估計一下，卽使眞的是喬裝也不要緊，傢伙是會勝過了笨重的刀槍的。</p>
<p>過了善快一個時間，不好的思索溶解了，他們是麼良的商民，雖帶了鐵尺却擋不了兇橫的搶刦。心地是誠摯的，只這麼一會已經混的滿熟，對於不幸的遭刦，我們同樣的抱着憤恨。眞的，年頭大壞了，地方又貧瘠，在他們的想念里，也許要認為我們的生活是在所謂三十三天的天堂吧！</p>
<p>至札佐他們下去了。</p>
<h3>牛</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>六月，借了避暑這個名目偷偷的回到了家鄉，整天關在屋子裏搖着破芭蕉，像一條蟄居的寒蟲似的我只想把自己的身體深深地掩埋起來，不給任何人知道。但為了方帽子的緣故吧，鄉間的親友都用了好奇而帶着期望的心和我忙着應酬。一想，蟄居得太久，究竟不是一件事，於是像一隻辛苦的旅雁伶仃地重回老巢裏去——上海。</p>
<p>滿想再提起筆桿，把自己的生命在方格子的稿紙中打發過去，可是出乎意外地接到了××中學的信，說是要我授一點課。學校近鄉村，為了吃飯及自己身體的健康起見，我毫不躊躇地答應了。</p>
<p>坐着板凳聽先生指手劃脚的講已是十多年了，可是要我自己站在講堂上去敎導人家，却還是破題兒第一遭。不管破題兒不是破題兒，敎總該敎。於是站到講堂上去了。喊了五十分鐘，秩序倒很好，大槪為了我帶了一副近視鏡，並臉色老是像陰天那樣沉板的緣故吧。</p>
<p>一隻牛剛上犁，總是快，快…牠只想向前走，並不過問田的耕得歪斜與否的，我，是一隻剛上犁的牛，走下講堂便聽得一個學生說：「這先生講得太快，太多」。我一直走到休息室裏，眼前只覺得有金蒼蠅在飛舞，我太疲憊，像一隻疲憊的剛脫犁的牛。</p>
<p>每天上一百分鐘課，他們却要上到二百五十分鐘左右。但是就疲憊的程度講：我遠勝於他們。除了以身體不健康來作解答外，我只能說，我是一隻剛上犁的牛呢！</p>
<p>最使我頭痛的要算是課卷的煩重。一百三十餘本的課卷，使我所有的時間都耗費掉了。和自家同室的靜君也改着八十餘本課卷，把兩張辦公案併在一起，所有桌子的面積統統被課卷佔住了。像早潮汐浪那樣，一班去，一班又來。星期六更糟，生活日記，大楷，小楷，五六百册本子堆着，像小山那樣。一個不留意便　會崩潰下來。然而這許多本子的料理，便要靠一般人必須休息的星期天。</p>
<p>旣是牛，星期天當然也得幹啦，咬緊牙關，不論早晨，不論晚上，提着筆，低了腦袋，勾，圈，點，添，就這樣，生命在課卷堆裏消逝了。一向親近我的悲哀也漸漸地離我而去了。在白熱的燈光下我幾乎連喝一杯白開水的時間也覺得可貴。一上床，呼呼地睡去。一起床，上講堂，你了腦袋埋在課卷裏。</p>
<p>這就是生活，是幸，還是不幸呢？深夜夢回，偶然聽着老銀杏樹上的瀟瀟的雨聲，也曾起了閒愁，鬧着失眠。我警惕我自己，我不能把我的生命常此消麿下去。我不是變得連靈魂也沒有了嗎？我眞像一隻牛，又笨，又呆，除了一口粗飯，我幾乎把什麼都失掉了。我已是一件機械，除了工作外，再沒有什麼。的確，這正合了牛的條件，馴服，耐勞，忍苦…我喊，我是一隻牛。</p>
<p>正面對着生活，所有的夢都消去了，但我是一個好夢者，我喜歡在夢裏過活，這夢不論是絳色的，紫色的，灰色的，以至是黒色的…，只要是夢我都喜歡做，可是此刻什麼夢也沒有，這頗使我悲哀。</p>
<p>這樣的生活過一百年又有什麼結果呢？這疑問，靜君當然也能感到。但他說：也許是自家解慰自家吧。「就個人言，這是對的。但你要想一想，假設我們敎好了這一輩孩子，這一輩孩子再敎好了別一輩的孩子，一百年後，這效果，在社會的進步上是怎樣？我們，是偉大的」。他肯定地，而且暢意地笑了。</p>
<p>細想之下，這頗有道理。但自家還是一個不懂事的大孩子，怎好去敎好人家呢？假設我眞的有一點力量能够把這一輩孩子敎好，我倒寗願消失了自己的一切的夢，去做一隻牛，馴服，耐勞，忍苦…，我喊，我永遠做一隻牛吧。</p>

<h3>Following Important Japanese Negotiations, Instructions Issued to Kawagoe to Continue Negotiations, Hoping for Resolution Through Diplomatic Channels; Arita Requests Ambassador Xu to Urge Chiang to Return to Nanjing; Japanese Cabinet Decides to Support a Tough Policy, Believing Chairman Chiang Can Eliminate Anti-Japanese Sentiment</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that, although Sino-Japanese relations appear unstable after the Shanghai incident, both sides' diplomatic authorities are maintaining a calm attitude, suggesting a less pessimistic outlook for the future. Kawagoe will meet with Foreign Minister Zhang again to continue exchanging opinions within the previously agreed scope, though the exact timing is yet to be determined. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, upon the invitation of Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, visited the Foreign Ministry at 4:30 PM today. The discussion lasted for over an hour. Arita, concerning the current critical situation, expressed hope that President Chiang would return to Nanjing to facilitate adjustments. Arita promised to focus on eradicating "anti-Japanese sentiment" and fundamentally adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Ambassador Xu agreed to convey Arita's wishes, clarify the National Government's position, and express the hope for long-term discussions between the two countries. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government believes that the three meetings between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe have yielded little progress. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that it is deeply regrettable that unfortunate incidents have occurred continuously while the Nanjing meetings are underway, particularly the third meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe, which left the Japanese government with a pessimistic impression. Nevertheless, we have instructed Ambassador Kawagoe to continue negotiations in Nanjing, hoping to resolve all issues through diplomatic channels. However, unless the National Government shows greater sincerity, Japan may resort to other measures with a grave determination. We believe Chairman Chiang has exceptional talent and, if he desires to eliminate "anti-Japanese sentiment," he can indeed achieve this goal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news received here today, the Japanese government has instructed its Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, to continue negotiations with Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on fundamentally adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, and not to halt them due to the case of the Japanese marines killed in Hongkou. This was decided at yesterday's meeting of the Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministers. It was also decided to instruct Ambassador Kawagoe to urge the Nanjing government to ask Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing as soon as possible so that he can meet directly with Chiang. This decision can be seen as a dampening effect on those generally advocating for military action against China. The Navy seems determined to continue increasing the strength of Japanese marines stationed in China to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in China, and to deal with recurring anti-Japanese incidents with stern local actions. However, the Japanese government currently does not seem inclined to increase its warships stationed in China, and has not explicitly discussed any military actions. Experienced Japanese politicians fully recognize that once China and Japan fall into conflict, the consequences would be unimaginable. This is not only because of China's vast territory and its internal characteristics, but also because China has special international relations, and Japan has a moral obligation to play a leading role in maintaining stability in East Asia. Although many believe that recent unfortunate incidents were intentionally designed to harm relations between China and Japan, Japanese political circles are indeed very dissatisfied with the progress of recent negotiations. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson today, Japan intends to continue negotiations to resolve various issues between China and Japan, but if the Chinese government does not show further sincerity, these negotiations will be meaningless. If that is the case, Japan must adopt other plans with great determination. The spokesperson also stated that Ambassador Kawagoe's three meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun have given the impression that the Chinese authorities have not truly understood the current situation, and therefore negotiations have made little progress to date. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita invited Chinese Ambassador Xu Shiying to the Foreign Ministry this afternoon for a meeting, and requested Xu to convey to the Chinese government Japan's intention to negotiate directly with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for a comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. Xu agreed to immediately cable his home government for instructions. According to an editorial published in today's Japan Times, the Japanese government is extremely reluctant to take any military or naval action in China, hoping to avoid it honorably, but only as a last resort. The Chinese government will be given every possible opportunity to deal with the current situation itself. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to official sources here today, the Japanese government has informed British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, that Japan does not wish to take hasty action against China, and that negotiations between Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on suppressing anti-Japanese activities will continue. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the cabinet meeting on the 25th, Foreign Minister Arita explained in detail the diplomatic negotiations with China, stating that they are currently awaiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's return to Nanjing from Huangpu, Guangdong, to negotiate with Chairman Chiang as the counterpart, and explained the Japanese side's determination and effective and appropriate countermeasures in the worst-case scenario, requesting the understanding of the cabinet members. Foreign Minister Arita stayed at the Prime Minister's official residence after the cabinet meeting adjourned, met with Prime Minister Hirota, and held a lengthy and important discussion on various countermeasures against China. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 3rd, Kawagoe Daichi gave a detailed report on the contents of his talks with Foreign Minister Zhang on the 25th. Upon arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Ministry immediately convened a meeting of senior officials to review the results of the official negotiations on the 15th and 16th. The Imperial Government believes that some of the matters initially proposed in the negotiations have not yet been raised, nor has the National Government's opinion on this been sought. Therefore, it has decided to order Ambassador Kawagoe to remain in Nanjing and cooperate with Consul General Suma to conduct negotiations in accordance with the policy decided by the three-minister conference. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kanoh Masazo, head of the Japanese Resident Group in Shanghai, arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 25th and immediately went to the Foreign Ministry to meet with Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, to report on the current situation in Shanghai. He plans to visit Foreign Minister Arita and the Army and Navy authorities to make the same report and is scheduled to leave Tokyo tonight to return to Shanghai. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's regular cabinet meeting convened at 10:00 AM. First, Foreign Minister Arita gave a detailed report on the progress of diplomatic negotiations. Navy Minister Nagano then expressed the Navy's firm determination and requested the understanding of the cabinet members. The cabinet members unanimously supported the policies of the Foreign and Navy Ministers, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the joint conference of the Foreign, Army, and Navy ministries held on the 14th, countermeasures were discussed, diplomatic negotiations were conducted, and emergency measures were established. Protecting the general Japanese residents in China is the urgent task at present, and this protection work is borne by the Navy. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Hankou and Japanese Residents Hold Emergency Meetings, Send Petition to Hirota, Requesting a Decisive Attitude Towards China</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Japanese Embassy Secretary Morishima has been consulting with Miura, Shirai, and others in Hankou for several days. There has been no indication of progress on the Yoshioka incident. Japanese residents held an emergency meeting at the Resident Group on the 25th and decided to send a telegram to the four ministers, Hirota, Arita, Terauchi, and Nagano, as well as Ambassador Kawagoe and Commander Kawa, hoping to adopt a decisive approach to China. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese Resident Group in Hankou held an emergency board meeting on the 24th. As a result, in the name of the Resident Group, a petition telegram was sent to Prime Minister Hirota, the three ministers Arita, Terauchi, and Nagano, and Commander Kawa of the Third Fleet, hoping to adopt a decisive attitude towards China.

<h3>Britain and the United States Both Emphasize the Shanghai Incident; The British Believe the Key Lies with Japan; The US Believes War Will Not Occur</h3>
<p>(London) The British government will adopt a "wait and see" approach to the recent killing of Japanese marines in Shanghai. Although the incident itself seems more serious than the cause of the January 28th Incident, the key lies in how the Japanese will utilize it. There seems to be no particular reason at the moment to suggest that Japan wants to take further action in China at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Official circles here today are still very concerned about the development of Sino-Japanese relations, but general opinion believes that war will not occur, as there are no Chinese troops stationed near Shanghai, which is different from the situation in 1932, and the Chinese people are also more calm than in 1932. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>All Japanese Warships Have Retreated from Beihai; Investigation of the Nakano Case Concludes; Ling Shifen Returns to the Province on the Fu'an Warship</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Beihai, 25th dispatch: Six Japanese warships came to Beihai to investigate the Nakano case, and the process went smoothly. Nakano's body has been cremated. On the night of the 24th, all Japanese warships departed. Nakano's wife, concubines, and children traveled together, and the people's hearts have been greatly settled. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ling Shifen left Beihai on the Fu'an warship on the 25th to return to the province. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Beihai, 21st dispatch: When Weng Qiu received Li Bai's telegram to withdraw troops, he initially refused to comply. Later, Li Bai telegraphed that the deputy division commander of the first division should retreat from Anpu first. Seeing the internal divisions, Weng Qiu held a military conference in Lianzhou and decided to withdraw the Beihai troops back to Lianzhou, allowing the Tan Sui troops to garrison Beihai. The entire withdrawal took place on the 21st, and the Tan troops arrived simultaneously to take over the defense. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Since the Japanese resident Nakano was killed in Beihai and Weng Zhaoheng's troops refused to allow Japanese personnel to land and investigate, Japanese warships have gathered outside the port, causing the situation there to become quite tense for a time. Now that the troops have been withdrawn and the investigation has come to a conclusion, the Japanese warships have also retreated, so the current situation in Beihai has eased. As for the results of the investigation into the Nakano killing case, they have not yet been announced. The Japanese investigators have taken Nakano's surviving family members with them on the Japanese warship Saga to Guangzhou, and they are expected to arrive there tomorrow. Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, Diao Zuqian, confirmed when meeting with reporters here today that the investigation has been completed, but he is unwilling to make any comments before receiving a detailed report and studying it. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)) (Domei News Agency) The second investigation of the Nakano incident was carried out on the 24th. First, the bereaved family listened to various matters, and then inspected the scene where Nakano was killed. Nakano's bereaved family decided to return to Guangzhou, and his property was handed over to Chinese officials for strict supervision. The above procedures were all completed at 2:00 PM today. The three surviving family members will be escorted to Guangzhou by the Japanese warship *unclear* from Haikou. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>British Side Denies Governor of Hong Kong Intervened in Sino-Japanese Issues, British Ambassador to Japan Visits Foreign Minister to Explain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding rumors that the Governor of Hong Kong met with Chiang Kai-shek in Guangdong, leading to speculation that the Governor of Hong Kong was mediating in Sino-Japanese affairs, the British Foreign Office has officially declared that the Governor of Hong Kong has absolutely no involvement in Sino-Japanese issues. British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, also acting on instructions from the British government, visited Foreign Minister Arita and Horiuchi this afternoon at the Foreign Ministry, stating that Britain does not wish to participate in the diplomatic negotiations being conducted between China and Japan. The British Ambassador told the Foreign Minister that the Governor of Hong Kong visits Guangzhou every September as a matter of custom. Because Chiang Kai-shek was staying in Guangdong this year, the two met and exchanged views, which was merely a matter of courtesy. The Governor of Hong Kong has no authority to speak on Sino-Japanese issues, nor has there been any factual negotiation on this issue. Furthermore, the British government has absolutely no intention of interfering in Sino-Japanese issues. It is hoped that the Japanese government will not misunderstand.

<h3>The Sudden Incident in Hongkou</h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Since the incident in Hongkou the night before last, where a Japanese marine was shot, the Japanese marines stationed in Shanghai have been fully mobilized, implementing strict alert measures. The once brightly lit city was suddenly filled with an atmosphere of deadly silence. Nearby residents were all trembling with fear, as if on a battlefield. Subsequently, the Japanese military further gradually expanded its defense line, penetrated deep into the Zhabei area, and arbitrarily checked pedestrians. The implications of these special actions were eerily reminiscent of the eve of the January 28th Incident. Just as we were anxiously seeking a swift resolution to the repeated outbreaks of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Incident, an unexpected disaster occurred in our own backyard, adding to the already complex entanglements. Today's situation is indeed ominous.</p>
<p>In this extremely tense atmosphere, what we want to express first and foremost is our plea for both sides to restrain their emotions and prevent the situation from escalating. Regarding the killing of the Japanese marine, we also extend our deepest apologies. After all, soldiers from a friendly nation, stationed on our soil, suddenly encountered an accident and lost their lives. As the host, we cannot help but feel deeply saddened. The local authorities have diligently offered condolences and assisted in apprehending the perpetrator, fulfilling their duties to the best of their ability and demonstrating the amity between our nations. That should be sufficient. If the Japanese side insists on intentionally blaming us, using various means of coercion to make things difficult for us, it would be a far cry from what sensible minds would do. Regarding this incident, if we argue that the location of the incident is outside the jurisdiction, then even if protection is thorough, it only addresses the main points. The suddenness of the incident makes it difficult for any wise person to prevent. Even considering the recent stabbing of the acting US representative in Japan, Mr. Dickover, while catching a thief, despite the strict deployment of Japanese police and the esteemed status of a foreign diplomat, he could not avoid this unexpected attack, and petty criminals were able to commit the crime and injure Mr. Dickover. This shows how difficult it is to fully prevent sudden incidents. The Japanese Foreign Ministry simply sent personnel to offer condolences, express regret, and do its best to apprehend the perpetrator. Mr. Dickover did not voice any dissatisfaction or make unreasonable demands. After all, human interaction is based on mutual understanding. With sincere communication, no problem cannot be resolved. If suspicion is rampant and one cannot feel secure, then even a reflection of a bow in a cup can become a snake. Ordinary people should still understand each other, let alone in matters concerning international etiquette. How can one so easily give way to anger and act impulsively, creating such a serious situation?</p>
<p>In short, now that things have reached this point, there is no need to argue about right and wrong. For the sake of maintaining local peace and security, we only hope that the Japanese side will retract its sails as soon as possible and not go too far. Any rash action can only be a temporary expression, otherwise, the hidden crisis may be unthinkable. It must be understood that any nation that deeply loves peace has a limit to its tolerance. If the Japanese side truly does not intend to worsen the situation, then it must give calm and rational consideration to this pressing matter.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods Sell Well in China, Unaffected by the Current Situation, Japanese Merchants Worry About Setbacks, Wakasugi Reports Strong Buying Interest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the recent state of Sino-Japanese trade in Shanghai, according to a telegram from Consul General Wakasugi in Shanghai to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce was instructed to investigate the impact of the current situation and disputes. It is reported that this year, due to the bumper harvest of agricultural products in inland China, the long-depleted inland rural areas have suddenly become active, and buying interest is strong. Although in the current extraordinary situation, Japanese goods such as cotton textiles, sugar, paper, industrial pharmaceuticals, dyes, hardware, groceries, and marine products are selling very well in China. Ships from Japan of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha are fully loaded with Japanese goods, reaching 35,000 to 40,000 tons in mid-September. Although some wholesalers in the Chinese business community are somewhat concerned about the current situation and eager to sell, the general public is not very concerned about the situation. After the Chengdu incident involving Japanese marine products, merchants in Chongqing continued to place orders with Japan for a considerable number of goods, while Japanese merchants are worried about the situation and deeply fear that Sino-Japanese trade will suffer setbacks. In short, the current Sino-Japanese trade in Shanghai has not been affected by the current situation. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Puppet Troops in Chahar North Concentrated for Training, Number Expanded to 100,000 with Active Recruitment, Decision to Invade Suiyuan Plan to Attack Early Next Month</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Wang Ying's puppet troops in Chahar North were defeated in eastern Suiyuan, they reorganized their troops in Zhangbei and other places in eastern Chahar and tried to transport military supplies. Because the Mongol bandits are all cavalry, large-scale attacks are not sufficient. It was decided to use infantry and replenish the strength of the infantry's military supplies. Their offensive plan is to first attack Datong and Fengzhen along the Ping-Sui Railway to cut off the connection between Suiyuan, Baotou, Wuyuan and Linhe. Suiyuan has learned of their conspiracy, and Fu Zuoyi has made strict arrangements. The puppet troops originally planned to act at the end of September, but were postponed to the beginning of next month due to some reason. All parties are paying close attention to this. Also, it is reported that the bandit troops who previously invaded Suiyuan have recently taken a defensive posture after seeing the solid defenses of Suiyuan. They are taking the opportunity to concentrate for training. The number is planned to be expanded to 100,000. Recently, bandit troops have often been seen holding flags to recruit new soldiers in the Zhangbei area, but most civilians are unwilling to enlist, and only a few Mongol bandits are joining.

<h3>League of Nations Begins General Debate, Eden Eloquently Speaks, Explaining British Policy, European Groups Confronting Each Other Threaten Peace, Tolerance and Self-Restraint are Crucial to Maintaining Order, Western Representative Accuses Countries of Interfering with the War's Conduct</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Eden addressed the League of Nations Assembly today on Britain's policy in Europe, saying that Britain does not want to see European countries divided into two groups due to their political systems. The seriousness of the current situation warrants a frank speech, so his choice of words today may not be as cautious as usual, and he hopes that the attendees will forgive him.</p>
<p>Nationalism is now very strong, and two different political systems have become confrontational. Trust is weakening everywhere in the world. Countries are now spending an increasing portion of their national wealth on armaments, even though it is detrimental to their economies. This is not a good phenomenon, but it is not yet hopeless. Countries can still work together. They must prioritize tolerance and self-restraint. Disparaging other countries' political systems will not enhance the respect for their own. Britain does not allow anyone to seize its democracy, which is an essential element for everyone striving for freedom, personality, and peace. It should be understood that just as I view my own political system, others have the same view of their own. Britain fully and completely accepts this principle. The first essential for countries to live in order is to believe in their own national ideology while tolerating the ideologies of other countries. Trust in the future is an indispensable factor for economic recovery. They must respect each other's national systems, and they also need an international order. This order should ultimately act as an arbitrator for disputes between countries.</p>
<p>Now, we must find a way to implement this agreement, and only then can civilization be preserved. Otherwise, civilization will perish. The British government's policy is to instill this belief in the League of Nations. When considering the future of the League of Nations, we should focus on two aspects: one is the League's machinery, and the other is the willingness to use this machinery. The latter is much more important than the former, but the machinery also needs to be improved.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then discussed the recent failures of collective security, saying that the main reasons were the lack of universality and the failure to take more forceful intervention in its early stages. Now, only by striving for universality can the League of Nations be given full effect and threats to peace be curbed.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary further touched upon plans to improve the League of Nations' covenant, saying that the British government believes that in the early stages of every dispute, the members of the League of Nations Council must clearly indicate what kind of intervention they are prepared to make to preserve peace. This is absolutely essential. The British government believes that regional agreements can find ways to enhance the implementation of the League of Nations' covenant, so the British government is determined to negotiate such agreements with Western European countries. As for the raw materials issue, it should be given due discussion by the League of Nations. Britain is prepared to have the League of Nations Assembly take steps in this direction.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary finally discussed the issue of armaments, saying that Britain must wait for countries to conclude an arms limitation treaty before it can cease its current course of action. In fact, disarmament involves not only military matters but also the spirit. Not only should armaments be put down, but the spirit of militarism should also be eliminated. Britain cannot sit idly by while countries arbitrarily expand their armaments to seek to inflate their power. The Foreign Secretary concluded by appealing to the League of Nations Assembly to strive to establish an international mechanism to resolve disputes between countries and avoid resorting to force. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Four Key Points of British Foreign Secretary's Speech</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly resumed its meeting at 10:00 AM this morning and began a general debate on political issues. British Foreign Secretary Eden was the first to deliver a speech, advocating for a total of four points: (1) The League of Nations Covenant should be separated from the Treaty of Versailles. (2) International agreements should be concluded to adjust the trade in raw materials. (3) The British government is prepared to cooperate with all countries to establish a general disarmament convention, but "spiritual disarmament" should be implemented at the same time. (4) The British government is prepared to negotiate regional conventions with Western European countries, but these conventions must be integrated with the League of Nations Covenant and approved by the League of Nations Assembly and the Council. In addition, Eden praised the democratic system, saying that it best protects freedom and maintains peace. However, he said that although the British government believes in the democratic system more than other countries, it will not make any sacrifices because of this belief. His conclusion was that if the world's countries are divided into several groups that confront each other, the impact will only make the world's complex situation even more unnecessarily complicated. It is hoped that all countries can be tolerant of each other so that the world can restore order and re-establish normal economic relations, upon which the world's economic recovery truly depends.

<h3>Western Representative Accuses of Supplying Arms</h3>
<p>Confident that the Government Will Be Able to Suppress the Rebellion After Foreign Secretary Eden finished his speech, Spanish Foreign Minister Bardy took the floor, saying that the government of my country can now prove that the non-intervention agreement concluded by various countries because of the civil strife in my country actually benefits the rebels. If my country had not encountered a similar situation, the civil strife would have ended long ago. What is aggression? It is when certain countries supply arms to the rebels. Bardy then put forward the conclusion: the government of my country is confident that it will be able to quell the civil strife. The people of my country, who do not want to live under a dictatorial regime, number in the millions, how can they sit idly by and wait to die? (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Spanish Foreign Minister Bardy today attacked the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War in a speech to the League of Nations Assembly, calling it an interventionist policy that is detrimental to the Spanish government. Bardy reserved the right to raise the matter in the League of Nations at a later date. Bardy said that the manner of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is a legal oddity, and it is what the political system and the rebels want. The spiritual and material assistance given to the rebels by various countries, in short, the so-called non-intervention is actively interfering on behalf of the rebels in order to blockade the Spanish government. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>After the Spanish Foreign Minister finished his speech, the League of Nations Assembly adjourned until tomorrow morning. The Council is scheduled to discuss the issue of the Free City of Danzig at 4:30 PM today. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[South American Representatives Discuss the Situation in Spain</p>
<p>(Paris) The correspondent of the Morning Post stationed in Geneva recently stated that the representatives of the South American countries in the League of Nations held a meeting last night to discuss the situation in Spain. The representatives of six countries (there are a total of nine South American member states in the League of Nations) said that their respective governments were prepared to recognize the National Army Government in Burgos City. If Spanish Foreign Minister Bardy made any intemperate remarks in his speech to the Assembly this morning, they would withdraw from the meeting hall and let the Uruguayan representative continue to attend. Once Bardy made criticisms about Uruguay's recent severance of diplomatic relations with Spain, they would respond sternly. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Representative Still Attends, Rome Remains Silent, Decision Not to Sever Ties with League of Nations for the Time Being, Seeks Compromise with Britain on Mediterranean Issue</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will not continue to insist on his views on the Abyssinian issue and will prepare to recognize Abyssinia's attendance at the League of Nations, which is limited to the usual practice of procedure and cannot be avoided. Although Rome officials are still silent on the matter, they do not hope that Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. According to opinions from political circles in Rome, the League of Nations' decision to allow Abyssinia to attend has indeed created a serious situation, but because Italy has not sent a representative to Geneva at the moment, the League of Nations' move will not necessarily force Italy to take action, and it is deeply believed that the League of Nations will eventually recognize that Abyssinia should not have a representative attending one day. The current resolution is only slightly delayed. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) An Associated Press reporter learned today that Prime Minister Mussolini, after studying the recent situation, has decided to remain in the League of Nations for the time being. There are two reasons for Mussolini's decision: (1) Before the League of Nations prohibits Abyssinian representatives from attending, Italy's refusal to cooperate with the League of Nations is tantamount to withdrawing from the League of Nations in fact. (2) Formal withdrawal would indicate that Italy and Germany are already taking consistent steps, but Mussolini deeply desires that Britain and Italy can reach a compromise on the situation in the Mediterranean. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources, the Italian government has instructed all representatives attending international conferences and various committees of the League of Nations in Geneva to withdraw immediately. However, the government pointed out that this tactic should not be regarded as a formal severance of relations between Italy and the League of Nations. (National Telegram on the 25th) [Geneva] On the Abyssinian side, Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian minister to Britain, will remain stationed and serve as the chief representative attending the Assembly. It is rumored that the French government or the French delegation has approached the Abyssinian Emperor, persuading him to voluntarily withdraw the country's attending representatives. The French delegation has issued a statement, saying that this is absolutely untrue. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>East African Italian Troops Ordered to Quickly Occupy All of Abyssinia to Leave No Excuse for International Intervention</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to information obtained by the "Paris Evening News" correspondent in Rome, the Italian government has strictly ordered the Italian military authorities in the Abyssinian capital to quickly occupy all of Abyssinian territory, especially the Goro region where the central government of Abyssinia is located, so that the Abyssinian government will have no place to establish itself, and the international community will have no further excuse for intervention.

<h3>Our Country Hopeful for a Permanent Council Seat</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The First Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, the Legal and Regulatory Committee, passed a resolution at today's meeting to temporarily increase the original nine non-permanent council seats of the League of Nations Administrative Council to eleven. One of the two additional seats will be retained by Portugal for continuous tenure, and the other seat is specially added for China. In addition, the terms of the original non-permanent council members, Argentina, Australia, and Denmark, have expired this year and will be re-elected by this General Assembly. It is reported that representatives of South American countries have unanimously nominated Bolivia as a candidate to replace Argentina's seat. In addition, it is expected that Australia's seat will be succeeded by New Zealand, and Denmark's seat will be succeeded by Sweden. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>French Representative Proposes Reopening Disarmament Negotiations; British Government Expresses Willingness to Support; Success Unlikely Without German Participation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The French delegation attending the League of Nations General Assembly has formally notified the General Assembly's Presidium, proposing to reconvene the disarmament conference to discuss the issue of limiting and reducing armaments. The disarmament conference was convened in 1932, but work was suspended in October 1933 due to Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Because the arms race among nations is extremely fierce, France has proposed reopening the disarmament conference, and the United Kingdom is also supporting it. However, with Germany and Italy not participating in the work of the League of Nations, it is uncertain whether the disarmament conference can achieve practical results. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French Foreign Minister today notified the Presidium of the League of Nations General Assembly, proposing that the League of Nations convene a presidium for the disarmament conference in order to reopen negotiations on arms limitation. France hopes that the solution to various European problems and the ultimate reduction of armaments can be achieved by starting from the economic aspect, which will be smoother than focusing solely on the political aspect. According to the Presidium, it was once advocated that disarmament negotiations could continue based on the following points: (1) control the manufacture and trade of arms; (2) publicize the military expenditure of budget proposals; (3) establish a permanent disarmament committee; (4) guarantee the implementation of all plans negotiated.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Advocates Convening a Six-Power Conference, Including the Soviet Union, to Replace the Locarno Conference</h3>
<p>(Paris) The diplomatic correspondent of Figaro recently declared, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini greatly hopes that major European powers, including the Soviet Union, can hold a conference in Rome to replace the Five-Power Conference that London should convene (i.e., the future Locarno Conference). His intention is to deprive the League of Nations of its leadership over European affairs." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>League of Nations General Assembly Elects Vice-Presidents; Italian Representative Also Elected</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations General Assembly elected the Italian representative, who is likely to attend, as one of its six vice-presidents, in the hope of somewhat appeasing Italy regarding the issue of Abyssinian attendance. It is generally believed that the purpose of this action by the General Assembly is none other than to indicate that yesterday's vote to allow the Abyssinian representative to continue attending the meeting was not intended to make things difficult for Italy. When the General Assembly elected the vice-presidents, the number of votes obtained by each country was as follows: France 49 votes, Canada 39 votes, Soviet Russia 37 votes.

In Geneva, it is expected that Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian envoy to the UK, will remain to serve as the chief representative to the General Assembly. It is rumored that the French government or the French delegation had approached the Abyssinian Emperor to persuade him to voluntarily withdraw the country's attending representative. The French delegation has issued a statement stating that this is absolutely not the case. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>British Conservative Leader Strongly Advocates British-French Cooperation to Jointly Resist Fascism; Preparedness in Land, Sea, and Air Forces</h3>
<p>(Paris) Former Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, leader of the British Conservative opposition, recently came to France and gave a public speech at the "Ambassador Theatre" here this afternoon, advocating that the two democratic countries of Britain and France should strengthen their air force power to jointly resist Fascism, saying, "France has the strongest army in the world, and Britain has the largest navy in the world. Therefore, only when Britain and France live in harmony can world peace be maintained. The policies of the two countries towards Geneva should be realistic and not be bound by principles. Dictatorial countries are now threatening the legacy of democratic politics, so democratic countries must have a way to defend themselves. Only when the French Republic and the British Empire join hands to seek peace and freedom can there be a solution. Moreover, our Britain and France are by no means weak and helpless, as rumored by the outside world. Remembering four years ago, the international situation was still different from today. At that time, I advocated British-French cooperation. Now, I thank God that the French army has become the most superior army in the world. As for the British navy, I dare say that it is far stronger than in 1914. Not only is it stronger than any one country's navy, but even if the navies of all European countries are combined, they are only enough to be enemies with the British navy. Now, the only thing that has become a problem is the air force. Therefore, Britain and France should make greater efforts on this issue to make the democratic countries invincible in the world. However, in any case, it would be a big mistake to think that the air forces of Britain and France currently have no defensive capabilities." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Budget Deficit of 300 Million Rubles</h3>
<p>Warsaw According to a published document here, the Soviet Russian budget had a deficit of 300 million rubles as of September 11. One of the reasons for this is the sluggish sales of public bonds, with only 41.6% of the total issued. The tax revenue from collective farms and private agriculture is also very low.

<h3>Spanish Government's Water Attack Strategy Succeeds; Counter-Offensive Begins Against Enemy Positions in the Southwest; Floodwaters Rush Like a Thousand Horses; Many Rebels Drown Before They Can Escape</h3>
<p>Madrid The Spanish government army yesterday opened the floodgates of the Albacete River on the southern front, releasing 10 million cubic meters of water to stop the rebels from advancing along the Tagus River basin. The capital was extremely jubilant upon learning of the government army's success with this water attack strategy. When the rebels were advancing along the already dried-up riverbed, they did not expect the floodwaters to rush in like a thousand horses, and many drowned before they could escape. It is also learned that one column of the rebel army, led by Colonel Yague, which was advancing towards Toledo, has been cut off by the floodwaters. At the same time, it is learned that the government army's front line has moved forward twenty miles. It is said that the government army will continue to release water until the rebels are completely routed. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid It is learned that the government army has begun a fierce counter-offensive against the rebels on the Talavera and Santolalla front lines southwest of Madrid and is now approaching the Talavera position. This victory of the government army is due to the effect of opening the floodgates of the Albacete River yesterday. After the floodgates were opened, 4 million cubic meters of accumulated water rushed to the plains, and many rebels were submerged. A large amount of food and ammunition were swept away by the floodwaters. The government army column, led by Colonel Navarro, took the opportunity to launch an attack and went straight to Talavera. The rebels had to abandon the positions destroyed by the water. Regarding the detailed battle situation, the government is keeping it strictly secret. In general, the government army's advance has not yet made contact with the rebels. According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of War, the government army began an offensive on the Talavera front, and the rebels suddenly retreated. On the central front, in the Navarre-Beral region, the government army attacked three positions occupied by foreign troops in the rebel army, seized a large amount of military supplies, and defeated the rebel cavalry. In addition, government aircraft continued to bomb the city of Oviedo, which will soon fall. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Remaining Garrison in Ancient Castle South of the Capital Resists; Rebel Aircraft Supply Food and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Seville Radio station of the Nationalist Army broadcasted news that the column led by General Yague had approached the city of Toledo and was about to occupy it. In the rubble of the Alcazar fortress in the city, a part of the young officers and soldiers are still defending it to the death. The Nationalist Army is now dropping food and ammunition by aircraft to replenish them. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Toledo Although the Spanish government claims to have occupied the ancient castle of Alcazar in Toledo, it is learned that the castle is still in the hands of the rebels. The government army has now launched a new attack on the castle, but judging from the situation, the garrison, which has resisted for ten weeks, seems to be able to hold out for at least several more days. At the same time, the rebel high command, after occupying the Makqueda fortress, is now preparing to make a final assault on Toledo. However, the rebel commander, General Franco, believes that it is advisable to proceed cautiously. Although the Spanish Nationalists are eager to rescue their brave comrades in the fortress, everything will be carried out prudently according to military strategy to avoid endangering the entire war.

<h3>Government Aircraft Fiercely Bomb the City of Oviedo; Casualties Reach 500</h3>
<p>Santander The artillery and aircraft belonging to the government army fiercely bombed the city of Oviedo in the northwest (held by the rebels and defended by Colonel Aranda) yesterday. Recently, a deserter from the city arrived here and claimed that during the government army's bombing, the estimated number of rebel casualties was around 500. It was also said that typhus was spreading widely in the city, and the number of deaths from this disease was quite high. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Fabrication; Protest from Romania and Czechoslovakia; Military Plans Are Entirely Fictitious</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the governments of Czechoslovakia and Romania lodged protests with the Berlin government against the unfounded rumors spread by German officials and newspapers against the two countries. The Czechoslovak note declared that German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels had made a statement that airfields had been built in Czechoslovak territory bordering Germany for Soviet aircraft to land, and that Soviet officers in Czechoslovakia were preparing plans to fight against Germany. The above statements are also commonly seen in German newspapers. Although they have been repeatedly denied by Czechoslovakia, they remain ineffective. This kind of action is enough to disrupt the friendly relations between the two countries. It is reported that Romania has lodged an oral protest with Germany through its foreign minister regarding the reports in German newspapers that a railway, which is currently of great military importance, runs through Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and that the Romanian government has allowed it to pass through its territory. It is said that although this kind of rumor has been repeatedly denied, it is still enough to create an impression among the German people that is against Romania. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Party Commemoration Day; Promulgation of a New Constitution; General Amnesty for Political Prisoners; Active Road Construction in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Rome) The 28th of this month is the 14th anniversary of the Fascist Party's march on Rome. At that time, Prime Minister Mussolini will be ennobled as the Imperial Chancellor of the Fascist Empire, and the government will promulgate the new Imperial Constitution and a general amnesty for political and administrative prisoners.

These projects include (1) the highway from the northern city of Tessenei to Addis Ababa, (2) the highway from the Italian port of Assab in Eritrea, North Africa, to Tessenei, (3) the highway from Tessenei to Magale. (Note that part of this road has already been completed.) The entire highway plan includes a major north-south trunk line from the Eritrean port of Massawa, via Tessenei, Addis Ababa, and Dolo, to the Italian Somaliland port of Mogadishu. After mobilization, 150,000 to 200,000 workers will participate in the work. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Next Year's Huge Budget Exceeds 3 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Ministry of Finance has made routine reductions to the amounts requested by various ministries for Japan's 1937-38 budget, the total amount will undoubtedly exceed ¥3,000,000,000. The ¥3,204,491,000 budget for the next fiscal year includes ¥1,865,500,000 in basic expenses and ¥1,338,991,000 in supplementary budgets. The new requests submitted by the Army and Navy total ¥826,000,000, accounting for 65% of the supplementary budget. The above figures do not include interest on new bonds projected by the Ministry of Finance, as well as expenses for tax reorganization and various improvements. If these are included, the total budget may increase to ¥3,300,000,000. If the ¥200,000,000 decided by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for local financial reorganization is added, the total budget will increase to ¥3,500,000,000. The Ministry of Finance's desire to reduce the budget by as much as ¥400,000,000 or ¥500,000,000 may not be realized. The draft budgets submitted by the various ministries are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Basic Budget: Ministry of the Imperial Household ¥4,500,000, Ministry of Foreign Affairs ¥19,300,000, Ministry of Home Affairs ¥144,000, Ministry of Finance ¥461,300,000, Ministry of the Army ¥336,000,000, Ministry of the Navy ¥430,000,000, Ministry of Justice ¥39,000,000, Ministry of Education ¥134,600,000, Ministry of Agriculture ¥75,100,000, Ministry of Commerce ¥13,400,000, Ministry of Communications ¥191,500,000, Ministry of Colonial Affairs ¥16,300,000, Total: ¥1,865,500,000.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary Budget: Ministry of Foreign Affairs ¥30,000,000, Ministry of Home Affairs ¥121,700,000, Ministry of Finance ¥11,500,000, Ministry of the Army ¥486,000,000, Ministry of the Navy ¥340,000,000, Ministry of Justice ¥6,000,000, Ministry of Education ¥55,687,000, Ministry of Agriculture ¥101,000,000, Ministry of Commerce ¥27,724,000, Ministry of Communications ¥58,000,000, Ministry of Colonial Affairs ¥17,780,000, Total: ¥1,338,991,000.

<h3>French Financial Panic Worsens; Bank Discount Rate Increased to 5%; Franc Devaluation Seems Unlikely to Be Implemented Immediately</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Bank of France's interest rate has risen to 5%, which has greatly surprised the public. The bank issued a weekly report today stating that gold reserves have decreased by another 840 million francs. The increase in the discount rate from 3% to 5% has caused a kind of political panic. The government's cheap money policy has long been known, but this measure had to be taken to curb the outflow of gold. Since 1931, the amount of gold outflow has reached a huge 35,000,000,000 francs. The Bank of France's gold reserves currently total 52,691,000,000 francs, which is still more than the statutory reserve amount, but is gradually approaching 50,000,000,000. If it is necessary to prepare for any unexpected events, such as war, this number will be reduced as much as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Public opinion seems to suggest that the devaluation of the franc will not be decided immediately. It is reported that French Finance Minister Rivol has now drafted a strict procedure to restore the treasury and will submit it to the cabinet meeting this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Bank of France's discount rate was raised from 3% to 5%, various newspapers here commented on it. Le Petit Parisien reported, "In the past month, the Bank of France's cash reserves have continued to flow out of the country. This is the direct reason for the bank's increase in the discount rate." Le Petit Journal reported, "The outflow of French cash is abnormal and unreasonable, whether from a financial situation or from French politics. Now that the Bank of France has raised the discount rate by two percentage points, it can be corrected." L'Écho de Paris published an article by a famous reporter, stating, "I have received information from reliable sources that Prime Minister Léon Blum, Finance Minister Olivol, and Minister of National Economy Spinasse discussed monetary issues several days ago. Spinasse advocated lowering the value of the currency, while Olivol firmly opposed it, but said that this move would be considered separately if an understanding was reached with the gold bloc countries and the United States and Britain." The communist party's organ newspaper, L'Humanité, said, "Some parties have already begun to attack the franc, and some newspapers have also advocated devaluing the franc. Our party must demand that the government use extremely severe means to deal with these pranksters." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Vandenberg, who has often criticized the New Deal, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today, stating that the huge amount of foreign investment in the United States may cause adverse economic consequences. Vandenberg said that the total amount of foreign investment in the United States has reached 40,000,000,000 US dollars, which has made a large part of the financial organization and price organization of the United States dependent on foreign judgment. In 1931, foreign investors withdrew their investments, which made the US economy even more depressed. Vandenberg believed that buying cash at high prices was the reason for creating this kind of international investment situation and predicted that the European situation would disrupt the US economic situation. After receiving Vandenberg's letter, the Treasury Secretary immediately replied that once the political disturbances in Europe and the Far East are settled, a part of the funds will probably still flow out, at which time the United States will benefit directly and indirectly. Even if there is a large amount of cash exports in a certain period, it will not affect the credit foundation of the United States. The federal government's current cash reserves cannot be allowed to be collected by private individuals, and the economic situation this year is also very different from 1931. In the past two years, the United States had a cash surplus of 2,956,000,000 yuan, which exceeded the total gold production in the world, excluding the United States, by 181,000,000 yuan.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Investigators Land to Investigate the Nakano Case in Beihai; Guangdong Army's Tan and Wu Divisions Take Over Defense of Beihai; Eight Japanese Warships Gather Off the Port of Beihai Awaiting Orders</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: After Li Zongren returned to Guangxi and ordered the withdrawal of Weng Zhaoyuan's troops stationed in Beihai, Weng's troops were ordered to first withdraw one regiment stationed in Lianjiang to Bobai on the Guangxi border starting on the 20th. The 159th Division of the 4th Route Army of Guangdong Province, led by Tan Sui, entered Lianjiang on the 21st to take over the defense. Mr. Xin, the former magistrate of Lianjiang County, entered the city with Tan's division to handle the aftermath. As for the Guangxi army stationed in Beihai and Hepu, they began to withdraw successively on the 21st. The Guangxi army here was the Independent 1st Division under Weng Zhaoyuan and the 61st Division under Qiu Zhaochen. On September 18th, the people of Beihai held a memorial meeting for the "September 18th Incident," and the atmosphere was tense. Fortunately, the garrison was on guard, so no more accidents occurred. When they were ordered to return to their garrison on the 20th, the Weng and Qiu divisions successively withdrew to the Guangxi border. On the same day, Tan's division also sent the Luo Cequn brigade to station in Anpu and Huangjinxu. The regiments of Pan Biao and Zhao Guanlan advanced along Gongguanxu and Qichangsi to Beihai and immediately issued a notice to reassure the people. As for the 154th Division under Wu Jianxiong, which continued to advance to the south, it also advanced to the Huaxian, Dianbai, Shuiche, and Maoming areas on the 23rd to coordinate defense with Tan's division. On the 21st, the entire Beihai area was completely taken over by the Guangdong army's Tan division. Ling Shifen, a special envoy sent by the Anfu warship to investigate the Nakano case, landed on the afternoon of the 22nd, requested the defending army to send a team to protect him, and contacted local gentry and merchants to discuss the progress of the investigation. On the morning of the 23rd, he telegraphed Jizhu Teiji, the Japanese vice-consul stationed in Guangdong, and Japanese staff member Songfu Hirohito, who were on the Sagano warship, to land together. Tan Sui, the commander of the division, and Xu Rangxuan, the chief of staff of the division, personally went to Beihai that day to order the maintenance of order. Ling Shifen, Yang Bingnian, Jizhu Teiji, Songfu Hirohito, and other Sino-Japanese investigators of the Nakano case were entertained by all sectors of the Beihai city gentry and merchants, and the details of the unfortunate incident that day were reported in detail. The Sino-Japanese investigators also inquired about the case in detail and summoned the suspects in the case one by one for questioning. It will take several days to investigate the case clearly before returning to the province to report. Sino-Japanese diplomatic agencies will begin negotiations based on the investigation report. It is said that the coffin of the deceased Nakano Shunzo was temporarily placed in a vegetable garden outside Beihai City after being coffined and buried. It is not yet known whether the coffin was opened for examination. After Nakano's death, his son Nakano Kiyoshi was still studying at Hepu Middle School, and his eldest daughter Tsuruko was still managing the Maruichi store. The Nakano family has completely become Chinese. Nakano Shunzo spoke the local dialect on weekdays, no different from a scholar, so he occupied a considerable position in Beihai society. His Maruichi store was located on Zhuhai Middle Road in the city. In 1926, it was once robbed by bandits. Nakano relied on foreign power and eventually obtained tens of thousands of yuan in compensation for the loss. After that, the store expanded even more, selling not only Western medicines but also foreign groceries, and serving as the Beihai manager of the Japanese Osaka Shosen Company. After Nakano's death, the Japanese side paid close attention to it. In addition to sending investigators on the Sagano warship first, it is said that eight Japanese warships have sailed to Beihai and gathered at the mouth of the Beihai Sea, including the Wakatake, Kuma, Yūbari, Ōtaka, Fuyo, Kaya, and Asagao. Except for the Sagano, which sailed from Guangzhou, the rest were directly sent by the Japanese Naval Province. It is said that the soldiers on the ships are preparing every day. (September 24th)</p>
<h3>Hankou Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Request Extension of the Implementation Period for Income Tax; Provincial Federation of Commerce Also Telegraphs Beijing for a Unified Demand</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The Hankou City Chamber of Commerce believes that the government has already decided to start collecting income tax on October 1st and January 1st of the 26th year of the Republic, respectively. However, October 1st is during the eighth month of the lunar calendar, right after the harvest season when businesses are busy operating. January 1st of next year is during the first month of the lunar calendar, far from the end of the year. If the tax is collected on schedule, businesses will be uneasy. In addition to sending letters to various industries the day before yesterday, requesting a unified demand to extend the implementation to March 1st of next year, it also telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, as well as Ministers Kong and Wu of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, yesterday, requesting them to consider the difficulties of businesses and approve the request. The Provincial Federation of Commerce will also make a unified demand. The telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce is recorded as follows: To President Jiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu Jun of the Ministry of Industry: We received the Hankou Municipal Government's forwarded implementation rules of the Provisional Income Tax Law, as well as an explicit order stating that income from the second category of salaries and remuneration for public officials and income from the third category of interest on public bonds and deposits will be collected starting from October 1st of the 25th year of the Republic, while all other items will be collected starting from January 1st of the 26th year of the Republic. We are to be informed, etc. Upon receipt of this, the association carefully studied the Provisional Income Tax Law and found that the tax rate was harsh and detailed, so we had to request modification. Business resources are exhausted, so we had to request a postponement of implementation. On August 21st, we listed the facts, reasons, and various difficulties, and submitted a request for approval. However, this case is of great importance to business operations. At a time when commerce is declining and people's livelihood is withered, we still earnestly ask you to observe the situation and approve our previous request. On the one hand, modify the tax rate and postpone implementation to alleviate business difficulties and relieve the people's plight. In the unlikely event that it is difficult to postpone in order to organize national revenue, then collecting in stages on October 1st of this year and January 1st of the 26th year of the Republic will cause great disturbances in the business community. This is because October 1st is during the eighth month of the lunar calendar, right after the harvest season when businesses are busy operating. January 1st of next year is during the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, far from the end of the year. If income tax is collected on schedule, businesses will be uneasy. The association speaks for businesses, and its pain is indescribable. We should request a unified extension to March 1st of the 26th year of the Republic, so that the business community can get used to it, and after the end of the year, all industries can proceed in an orderly manner without much worry. This is what the association is eagerly praying for. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping that you will consider it. Hankou City Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Sends Personnel to Hankou to Investigate the Yoshioka Incident; Written Record of Foreign Eyewitnesses; Japan Disregards It in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Since the Yoshioka incident occurred, the Japanese authorities have begun investigating and our officials have assisted in arresting the murderer with great enthusiasm. However, the Japanese side, based on the confession of Liu Ya, a peddler arrested who is only eight years old, insists that the case occurred on a Chinese street and that the murderer was a man in his thirties wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt, believing that he was harmed by a Chinese. Therefore, they have increased troops in the Hankou River and tightened security. Consul General Miura and Vice-Consul Shirai, stationed in Hankou, also visited Governor Yang Yongtai of the provincial government on the 22nd and expressed their views. The truth of this case has become even more elusive. Our officials have made the greatest efforts to assist in the investigation. After investigation, a very important eyewitness has been found. The person's name has not yet been announced, but it is known that she is a female national of a northern European country. At the time of the incident, she was traveling by rickshaw from Hejie in the Japanese Concession to the Meifu Wharf. When she was about six or seven zhang away from Yoshioka's post, she suddenly heard two gunshots and saw Yoshioka fall beside his post. After the incident, the rickshaw continued to move forward and passed by the body. She saw an elderly stallholder and a child, startled by the gunshots, running down Hejie. She did not see anyone in a blue short-sleeved shirt. The circumstances she described were very clear and consistent with the testimony of Huang Qingyun, an elderly stallholder. This proves that Yoshioka's death was indeed beside his post, that the body was not moved after death, and that the murderer's entry and exit route must have been from Dazheng Street in the Japanese Concession, without any doubt. After hearing her statement, our officials wrote a record and officially requested the Japanese side to send personnel to the consulate of the country to which the person belonged to jointly inquire about everything. However, after receiving the letter, the Japanese side declined on the grounds of being too busy and did not send anyone. A second letter was sent, but there was no response. A third request was made for them to set a date themselves, but it was not approved. However, based on Liu Ya's confession, on the 22nd, Zhang Jinghuai, secretary of our municipal government, Wang Yufen, chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and Dong Kerene, section chief, went to the Japanese police station at the invitation of the Japanese police station to verify the record. The Japanese side did not agree with the foreign eyewitness's statement. On the same day, Liu Ya and Huang Qingyun were questioned for the second time. Huang's statement was the same as before, but Liu's statement had some discrepancies, which shows that the child is ignorant and his words are not credible. After the questioning, the Japanese side asked Zhang and others to sign, but Zhang and others refused because their task was only to verify the record, not to hold a joint trial, and there was no need to do so. Our side believes that the foreign person's statement is sufficient as a clue for the development of this case and is conducting an independent investigation in order to get to the bottom of it. Also, according to the report of the Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Consulate in Hankou, Mori Shima-shuto, a first-class secretary, was specially dispatched from Beijing on the 23rd to Hankou by China Aviation plane to investigate the truth of this case and to discuss the progress with Consul General Sanpei and Vice-Consul Shirai. It is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop in the future. (September 23rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Telegraphic Request to Abolish Housing Donation</h3>
<p>The county's business and shop housing donation has been in effect for many years. Recently, according to provincial orders, a household housing donation will be organized, with the rent as the standard. If the household is self-produced, the valuation ratio will be used. First, the police will be sent to carry a survey form to investigate each household, to find out the number of rooms in the house, the value, and the amount of rent in great detail. However, those who do not understand the truth are generally panicked. The county's Chamber of Commerce, regarding this case, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the provincial government and civil administration of this province today, stating: The Songjiang local authorities recently sent police officers to arbitrarily assess the value of housing, saying that they wanted to expand police funding and add household housing donation. Merchants were shocked and residents were horrified, telling each other with frowning brows and uneasiness. At a time when the countryside is collapsing and all industries are declining, and relief is too late, how can we pile things on top of each other and add burdens? It is difficult to accept such illegal and harsh levies. We earnestly request that the housing donation be abolished by explicit order as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering.</p>
<h3>Bawo Township Banditry Case Cracked</h3>
<p>Wu Huiyuan and Guan Yuandi, wealthy brothers from Bawo Township, First District of this county, lived together in one house. They were robbed in July of this year. The owner was kicked in the abdomen by the robbers and the women's lower bodies were burned. The crimes were very heinous. The Public Security Bureau ordered a strict arrest, but the case was not solved for a long time. Yesterday, Yang Shijie, the detective captain of the Public Security Bureau, learned that the suspect Xu Daguizi was hiding in Tianmashan Town, so he went to the Seventh Resident Police Station to arrest Xu. Xu confessed that Xu Xiaohuzi was the leader and that the gun was also supplied by him. He is now hiding in the house of Zhou Ji in Wangjiafen Mountain, Rihuigang, Shanghai. Detective Yang led detectives Wei Yunhui and Zhang Yunxiang and set off at 4:00 AM this morning, arriving at Rihui</p>
<h3>Private Soil Found in Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 9 car of the Shangsong Company, which returned from Shankai, was searched by soldiers of the Shanghai Security Team at Beiqiao. Private soil was found in the seat cabinet of the driver, Shen Jinfu, packed in a mooncake box, weighing eighty taels. It was taken back to the county government and transferred to the Third District Security Command for interrogation on suspicion of private trafficking. According to Shen Jinfu, who lives under the Maluqiao embankment in this city, he did not know it was soil and it was sent by a friend.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Robbery and Murder by Ruthless Bandits</h3>
<p>Lu Jianting's house in Bian Sha, Sixth District, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 21st. Each held guns and knives and broke down the door. At that time, Lu's long-term worker, Chen Quanjing, was not yet asleep. He tried to rush out to call for help, but was shot and killed by a bandit. Lu was frightened by the sight and could only allow the bandits to rummage through the boxes, stealing one hundred pearls, sixty-five yuan in banknotes, several gold ornaments, and many clothes. Also, Zhang Dequan's house in Xiukang Township, Fifth District, was invaded by more than ten bandits the night before. Zhang's wife was injured in the head and other parts with wooden sticks. Twelve yuan in foreign currency and gold ornaments and clothes were stolen. Afterwards, Wang Julin, the township chief, and Sun Yunda, the patrol officer of the Zhoupu Public Security First Resident Police Station, jointly inspected and reported the case for investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Continued Detention of "Xiang Hua" Relatives</h3>
<p>More than ten young people in this county, including Gong Wei, Shi Chengzhe, Xu Zhenya, and Sheng Xichang, published the "Xiang Hua" bi-monthly, which contained slander. County Magistrate Peng issued a handwritten order to the Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrested Xu Zhenya, Sheng Xichang, and Gong Wei one after another. On the 24th, Lu Qianyuan, Zhou Zuzhen, and Ma Chiju, relatives of the journal, were also summoned.

<h3>Wujiang: Security Team Soldiers Cause Trouble Again</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd, at about 8:00 PM, dozens of soldiers from the 34th Company of the 9th Team of the Provincial Security Team stationed in this county surrounded and violently beat Yang Shushi, the Wujiang correspondent of the Suzhou Early News, inside the county government building. They punched, kicked, and knocked him to the ground. Although Yang Bin, the company commander of the team, tried his best to stop them, the people were too numerous and loud, and to no avail. Later, the county government received the news and sent Wu Juxin, the director of the Wujiang County Vagrant Training Center, to rescue Yang and send him to the County Hospital for treatment. The injuries were very serious. It is said that the reason was that the Early News published that Director Xu was promoted to the province as the security of the two companies, requesting the establishment of a training director, which led to the soldiers misunderstanding and causing a mass beating. Now the Early News has specially sent Yan Yisheng to Jiang on the 24th to express his condolences and plans to telegraph the province and county to severely punish the ringleaders.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Restriction on Slaughterhouse Fees</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Slaughterhouse, founded by Jin Decai, chairman of the local beef industry association, has been operating since the first day of July in the lunar calendar. Statistics show that it can slaughter about 20 heads per day. For outside beef cattle entrusted to the slaughterhouse for slaughter, a fee of 6.4 yuan per head is required (including 2 yuan in business tax), and the meat price is raised without authorization. Therefore, ordinary beef merchants are suffering from this heavy blow in this depressed society and are living a difficult life. Yesterday, the owners of various wholesale stores once gathered to discuss and decided to jointly ask the beef industry association to convene a members' meeting to discuss the meat price issue and ask for justice and appeal to the party and government agencies for relief in order to maintain business difficulties. At the same time, the provincial government instructed the county government to restrict the charging methods of the slaughterhouse, stipulating that the fee for each cattle should be one yuan and the fee for slaughtering a sheep should be two jiao, and no arbitrary overcharge should be allowed to show the restriction. After receiving the order, Magistrate Long immediately notified the slaughterhouse to comply.</p>
<h3>Three Ruthless Bandits Captured</h3>
<p>The Second Longzhu Temple in Zhoujing Alley was robbed by seven or eight bandits late at night on the tenth day of July in the lunar calendar this year. Pu Yi, the abbot, was held by the bandits and stabbed in the leg with scissors for shouting for help. After the incident, he reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and arrest. The day before yesterday, Wang Zhongyun, the captain of the detective team, received a secret report saying that the bandits who robbed the Longzhu Temple, Gao Abaobao, Deng Achun, and Zhang Xianggen, were hiding in Shijishang, Zhoujing Alley. After receiving the report, Captain Wang led detectives to the countryside to arrest them and arrested the above three criminals. One dan of wheat, five or six sheng of white rice, 20 yuan in legal tender, and dozens of pieces of clothing, all stolen goods, were found at Deng Achun's house and taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Suicide by Drowning and Then Slitting Throat</h3>
<p>Sun Rugui, a 37-year-old man from Guizhou dressed in a black suit and sneakers, arrived at Yudaibian bridge in Wu County at around 4 p.m. on the 24th. He was looking nervous and unstable. He first took off his hat and threw it into the river, then threw himself into the river to drown himself. However, the river was very shallow and he did not drown. At this time, Sun Rugui took out a razor blade from his side and stabbed himself hard in the throat, causing blood to splatter everywhere. He fell into the water. Soon, a watchman passed by and was horrified by the sight. He immediately joined forces with nearby police officers to rescue him from the water. Because the bleeding from his throat did not stop, he was unconscious and was hired by car to the Wujin Hospital for treatment. The doctor inquired about his name and age, and he did not answer at first. When asked about the reason for his suicide, he was unable to speak and only wrote the words "harmed by a friend" with a pencil. He died of his injuries at about 6 p.m., which was also tragic.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Demise of Elderly Gentleman Wang Jingtong</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingtong, who served as chairman of the Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce and standing committee member of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, suddenly passed away at 2:00 PM on the 24th at his private residence on the Tudi embankment outside the South Gate due to a stroke. Wang originally opened an oil mill on the Tudi embankment outside the South Gate for many years. His family was originally well-off. Since Wang managed the business, his living standards have increased day by day, so that today, there is little family property left. When Chang Sun Chuanfang retreated to Jiangbei, the local area was chaotic and no one maintained the county administration. Therefore, Wang successively took over the official seal for three months. After the national army settled Jianghuai, Wang was once elected as a representative to the National Assembly and obtained membership in the Chinese Kuomintang. In this election, he also participated in the Jiangsu Provincial Vocational Group Chamber of Commerce election and had already obtained the preliminary election qualifications. However, during the prior efforts to solicit and contact people, he was often exposed to the wind and rain, so he may have overworked himself, which led to a stroke a few days ago. At that time, he was unconscious. After the best efforts of Chinese and Western doctors, he finally stabilized a little. He suddenly suffered another stroke on the morning of the 24th, and eventually died at 2:00 PM. It is said that Wang was 57 years old. His wife died three years ago. He currently has four concubines living inside and outside the city. His two sons have now started their own families. When the bad news came, everyone mourned the loss of a local talent.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Joint Transport for Viewing Tide</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar is approaching, the Zhejiang Highway First District Management Office notes that the Haining tide is particularly large. Last month, the stone railings, iron chairs, and part of the civilian houses in the coastal park were destroyed by huge waves. The Haining County Government specially raised funds from all parties to repair them in order to attract viewers. The Highway Bureau also applied to the Construction Department for an appropriation of 200 yuan and hired workers to rush to build a viewing platform with seats for 600 people. It also allocated 40 large buses to meet the needs. On the one hand, it has reached an agreement with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to handle joint transport. Joint tickets have been printed and delivered to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway for sale. Joint transport special trains will run for four days starting on October 1st. When the first and second express and ordinary trains from Shanghai arrive at Chang'an Station, the Highway Bureau will send cars to pick them up and return on the same day.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: More Than 10,000 Jin of Smuggled Salt Seized</h3>
<p>Zhu Dehui, a private salt suppression supervisor of the Yuyao Salt Administration Inspection General Office, received a tip that private smugglers were secretly transporting a large amount of private salt for export at the mouth of Hangzhou Bay. He led a team of police to arrest them. However, the private smugglers opened fire and resisted arrest. After a long struggle, the private smugglers were defeated and sailed away. A total of more than 10,000 jin of private salt were seized from two large seagoing ships, and a private smuggler named Zhang Rengui was arrested and sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yunyi Causes Trouble at Sea</h3>
<p>Wang Shanben, Wang Shanzhong, and Wang Shanqing, rice merchants from Chen Zhao, Xiangdong, always transported rice to sea for profit every time the autumn harvest arrived. This year, he and He Hongcheng and others, rice merchants from Haidun, transported 60,000 jin of grain to sea. This was known to Lu Xinlan and other villagers, who reported to the militia team to stop them because the people's food was at stake. However, the Wangs took preemptive action, inviting many people in the industry and gangsters, intending to resist. The team members returned to the team when they saw that they were outnumbered. Yun Guantou, an old farmer watching, was severely beaten. Later, Captain Zhang led the team to arrive, and the crowd dispersed. Wang Shanzhong, the murderer, and Lu Xinlan, the reporter, were taken to the county for interrogation. Yun Guantou was reported to the county by his son to verify the injury.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Township Chief Kills Out of Spite</h3>
<p>Du Pusheng, the township chief of Hufang Township, Third District of Guanyun County, and Qiao Jipei, the village chief, had a long-standing feud and had long wanted to frame Qiao. Therefore, they took advantage of the repair of the Liutanghe dike and induced Du Chenghuan, the village chief of the Sixth Ward, Du Chengfang, the village chief of the Seventh Ward, Ge Zhendong, the village chief of the Eighth Ward, and Ge Youqing, the village chief of the Ninth Ward, to stamp a blank official document, saying that the repair of the Liutanghe dike was urgent and that they should first stamp the blank official document so that it could be taken to a certain place for negotiation. The village chiefs did not suspect that it was a public matter and stamped it. Unexpectedly, the township chief took a blank official document back and immediately filled it in with the fact that Village Chief Qiao was harboring his brother-in-law, Zhuo Fei, in Wang Shankui, and reported it to the provincial security team stationed in Xin'an Town. The team then sent a team to arrest Village Chief Qiao and Wang Shankui. Township Chief Du shot and killed Wang in front of the village. Now Qiao's family has reported to the county government and requested an inspection to redress the injustice. It is said that the county government has sent personnel to inspect yesterday.</p>
<h3>British Correspondence: Anglo-Egyptian Military Alliance Treaty Established</h3>
<p>— Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>With just over 46 million people, including the Scots, the United Kingdom proper rules over more than 400 million colonial subjects, becoming a world power where the sun never sets. How could the British not feel they are the most superior race in the world! Forty years ago, the British politician Joseph Chamberlain said: "I believe that the British people are the greatest ruling race the world has ever known." You can still see this view on every Englishman's face today. However, they will never say it to your face. Perhaps this is where the British race excels! Even though they rule over you, you don't think they are so bad, at least not the worst.</p>
<p>Seeming weak and incompetent is the second special trait of the British. Throughout history, many have predicted the inevitable collapse of the British Empire. But to this day, the empire remains intact. And with each war, the British are the ones who profit the most. Before the European War, the Germans said:</p>
<p>"Can British soldiers even fight? Just let them run to Germany, and we'll send the police to catch them." The European War proved that even the German army didn't have the ability to catch them. The British never let their enemies underestimate them. Recently, Mussolini announced that Italy could mobilize eight million troops. Yet the British Empire's formal standing army is only about 200,000. If you focus solely on these numbers, you will be fooled again.</p>
<p>Many people criticize the British for being cold-blooded, unemotional, and selfish businessmen. Yet the British pride themselves on their ability to cope with their environment, yes, their ability to cope with their environment. Their actions may be a little slow, but just slow enough to be in time. During the European War, they promised independence to the colonial people, but after the war, they did not hesitate to use force to suppress the colonial people's independence movements. A few years ago, weren't the Egyptian Nationalists regarded as complete rebels in the eyes of the British? Today, in 1936, the British not only recognize the independence of Egypt under the rule of the Nationalists but also clink glasses with Egyptian diplomats and establish a military alliance treaty. You may think they have changed too much, but this is the characteristic of British politicians.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Egyptian treaty was facilitated partly by the efforts of the Egyptian Nationalists in their independence movement, but the most important reason was that Italy's occupation of Abyssinia forced the British to make this concession. When Italian troops invaded Abyssinia last year and fierce battles broke out, the British fleet mobilized and concentrated in the Mediterranean, sometimes attempting to encircle Italy. At that time, in terms of strength, Britain's leadership position in the Mediterranean was absolute. The Mediterranean fleet alone had more tonnage than the entire Italian navy. With the Suez Canal in British hands, British politicians advocated a tough stance against Italy, and seemed willing to resort to force if necessary. The League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy were a product of this policy. However, all of this could not save Abyssinia from its fall. In the end, Mussolini triumphed, and the first to fail was none other than our British Empire!</p>
<p>This is the first and most tragic failure in the history of British diplomacy in centuries. We can see that British Foreign Secretary Eden first proposed lifting economic sanctions against Italy, which makes it clear how difficult Britain's situation is. Are the British really absolute pacifists? If the use of force could have maintained Britain's interests in Abyssinia, would the British have stood idly by and watched Italy swallow Abyssinia whole? Britain's failure this time was due to its overly conservative military preparations and its slow actions. The problem is that over the years, the British have not paid much attention to the new air force, while Italy has a large number of bombers. Theoretically, this batch of Italian bombers does not pose a great threat to the British Mediterranean fleet. Whether the air force can defeat the navy still lacks factual proof today. But the British finally softened. When the British Admiralty saw that their fleet was going to be the testing ground for this new type of warfare for the first time, they felt it was better to let Mussolini take a small advantage.</p>
<p>Italy's victory not only shook Britain's position in the Mediterranean but also threatened Britain's African colonies. Although Mussolini said that Italy was satisfied with obtaining Abyssinia and had no other extravagant desires, who dares to believe this statement! Britain's line of defense against Italy has shifted from the Abyssinia issue to the Egypt issue. This is something the British cannot sit idly by and watch if someone has ideas about the lifeline of their empire! The Suez Canal area. What the British are most worried about seems not to be Italy's eight million troops, but rather Italy secretly helping the Egyptian Nationalists' anti-British movement. Abandon Egypt, but be able to protect the Suez Canal, and they would rather abandon Egypt. This is the starting point of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. After the treaty was signed, Egypt gained an independent country, and Britain gained a friendly army to help defend the Suez Canal. Now that the Egyptians have achieved their goal of independence, they not only have no reason to hate Britain, but on the contrary, protecting the Suez Canal and protecting their own country is their own business. The security of the Suez Canal has become the common destiny between the British Empire and Egypt. With this premise, the British were so generous in sacrificing many of the interests they had already gained. Therefore, British public opinion warmly welcomed the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Only a few "die-hard" newspapers felt that Britain should not suffer such a loss. For example, the Morning Post said that Egypt cannot be talked about in terms of independence and autonomy. The only question is whether Egypt will belong to the Italians or the British in the future. Generally speaking, most British people recognize the value of this treaty. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was signed on August 26, 1936, at the British Foreign Office in London.</p>

<h3>Situation in Hongkou and Zhabei Eases: Meeting Held at Japanese Consulate Yesterday; Three Suspects Handed Over to the Court; Tian Gang's Body Cremated</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the incident on the evening of the 23rd of this month in which a Japanese sailor was attacked within the Public Concession, the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai immediately dispatched troops to the intersection where the incident occurred and to the Zhabei area in the extra-settlement area to set up posts and inspect pedestrians. The situation at the time was very serious. Afterwards, the troops stationed at various intersections were withdrawn, and the extra-settlement posts were also withdrawn, except for a very small number still stationed at 63 Huayuan and Bazibqiao. The market has returned to its pre-incident state. Here is a follow-up report on the incident:</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps had set up posts in the Zhabei area of the city across the boundary after the incident. The municipal government filed a protest, and the Japanese Consul General, upon receiving our protest letter on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, withdrew a portion of the Japanese troops stationed across the boundary back to their units that evening. The withdrawal continued yesterday morning, and as of last night, all Japanese troops had been withdrawn except for a very small number stationed at 63 Huayuan and Bazibqiao on Jiangwan Road. The situation seems to have returned to its pre-incident state without any visible change.</p>
<p>Situation in Hongkou</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter patrolled the North Sichuan Road area yesterday and found that the situation was more relaxed than before. The Japanese troops stationed in the area where the incident occurred have also been withdrawn. However, a small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in front of the Taoyuan Dance Hall and near the Japanese barracks. Occasionally, Japanese armored vehicles patrol North Sichuan Road, but the level of alert is no longer very high. The site of the incident is still cordoned off with straw ropes, and pedestrians are prohibited from walking through. Only one or two Japanese remain on the sidelines to watch.</p>
<p>Zhabei is Quiet</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency patrolled various parts of Zhabei yesterday, passing through Yokohama Bridge, Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, Shuidian Road, Bazibqiao, and Tiantong'an, as well as the Hongkou area, without any obstruction. However, a small team of Japanese troops is still stationed in front of 63 Huayuan on Jiangwan Road, and one or two Japanese are patrolling back and forth. A small team is also stationed at the Japanese cemetery at Bazibqiao, with an armored vehicle parked in front of the gate. In addition, several Japanese soldiers guard the crossing of the Songhu Railway at Tiantong'an. The Japanese soldiers in various places no longer inspect pedestrians. On the concession side, in the Hongkou area, Japanese soldiers, either scattered or in formation, still patrol the streets. The Japanese troops at the Japanese elementary school near Arui Lane on North Sichuan Road and at the Taoyuan Dance Hall further south have not been completely withdrawn. The Japanese troops at the traffic control post at the Xiaocai Market on Wusong Road have been withdrawn, but there are still many Japanese troops stationed in front of the Japanese Club on the corner of Penglu Road. The residents of Zhabei are calm, and there have been no reports of any relocations.</p>
<p>Japanese Meeting</p>
<p>In addition to the two meetings held the day before yesterday, the Japanese consulate held another meeting of key military and naval personnel in Shanghai at the consulate office on Huangpu Road yesterday morning at 10:00, centered on Army Attaché Kita and Naval Attaché Sato. In addition to Kita and Sato, those present included Commander of the Third Fleet Okawa, Commander of the Marine Corps Kondo, and the full complement of personnel from the previous day's meeting: Counselor Wakasugi, First Secretary Tajiri, Intelligence Director Yoshioka, Consuls Fukui and Terasaki, Army Assistant Attachés Utsunomiya and Sagata, Special Service Agency Director Kusumoto, and Navy Assistant Attachés Okino and Minato. The meeting was devoted to discussing the aftermath of the incident and lasted for over two hours, not ending until 12:15. At around 4:00 in the afternoon, Wakasugi again convened a meeting of all consulate personnel, including Fukui, Terasaki, Secretary Nakata, Police Chief Kitamura, and Police Station Chief Tajima, which lasted for about an hour before adjourning.</p>
<p>Ma and Zhang Handed Over to the Court</p>
<p>The arrested suspects Ma Yongcai, Ma Yongnian, and Zhang Ronghe were sent back to the police station by the Japanese headquarters the night before last and handed over to the court for interrogation yesterday morning. However, the police station did not file a public prosecution but only requested that they be remanded in custody for further investigation. Therefore, the interrogation was rescheduled for October 3. Ma Yongcai, 30 years old, is from Jiading. His younger brother Yongnian, 27 years old, lives at No. 9 Ruiji Lane, Jiaxing Road. They both work at the Hongxing Printing Shop at No. 24 Ruiai Lane, 406 Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. Yongcai is a typesetter, and Yongnian works in printing. After 8:00 p.m. on the 23rd, the Ma brothers left the Hongxing Printing Shop after work to go home for dinner. When they arrived at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road in front of the Willie Movie Theater, the incident of the Japanese sailor being attacked had already occurred, and traffic there was blocked. The two Mas could not proceed, so they changed their route to North Haining Road. Unexpectedly, they were also stopped midway. They then turned back and took a detour along a small alley. Unexpectedly, the entrance to this alley was the location of the incident. There were Japanese soldiers inside and outside the alley, maintaining strict vigilance. The two Mas were caught in a dilemma, hesitating in between, which drew the attention of the selected soldiers, and they were arrested by the Japanese soldiers and taken to the police station for questioning. Subsequently, the patrol officer stationed there reported the arrest of people along the way by the Japanese soldiers to the Hongkou Police Station. The police chief then ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the Japanese military headquarters to request that the two Mas be handed over to the police station for legal investigation. It was not until the morning of the 24th (the next day) at 10:30 a.m. that the Japanese authorities permitted the transfer of the Ma brothers to the detectives, who took them into custody at the Hongkou Police Station. Zhang Ronghe, 21 years old, is from Taizhou and lives at No. 8 Xinruikang Lane, Dithville Road. He sells porridge for a living. At the time of the incident, his porridge stall was parked at the entrance of Lane 240, South Haining Road, about five or six zhang away from the place where the gunshots were heard. According to Zhang, he heard a total of four or five gunshots, and two of Zhang's fellow villagers, Chang Tai and Da Lazi, had set up food stalls two or three zhang away from the place where the gunshots were heard. Fearing that the two might be in danger, Zhang went to check on them shortly after the gunshots were heard and saw that they were both safe. He then walked to the yellow sand bucket at a nearby lane entrance. At that moment, Japanese Marines arrived to search the area and found a Mauser pistol in the sand bucket. Zhang was immediately arrested. The Hongkou Police Station sent detectives to the Japanese military headquarters to request his transfer. At 2:50 a.m. on the 24th, a pistol with the number 26352 or 2653 (the last digit of the gun number is either 2 or 3, which is difficult to identify) was found in Yuqingfang, West Haining Road. It has now been sent to the Public Works Department's Firearms Inspection Office for inspection along with the Mauser pistol. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., the police station sent Chinese and foreign detectives to escort the two Mas and Zhang to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Zhong Qing and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru took their seats in the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. The police station's representative lawyer was Zhang Shizhu. Lawyer Zhang briefly described the incident and requested that Ma and the others remain in custody for further investigation. Judge Zhong then questioned each of them one by one. All three claimed that they did not know the reason for their detention. The two Mas also described how they were treated well after being detained at the Japanese military headquarters, but Zhang's right eye was purple and slightly swollen. After the court hearing, the judge ordered that Ma and the others be held in custody and rescheduled the hearing for October 3.</p>
<p>Tian Gang Cremated</p>
<p>The body of the Japanese sailor Tian Gang was cremated on the Izumo warship at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The cremation was conducted by the ship's captain and all the ship's officers and men. Yoshioka, the intelligence director of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, and the consuls in Shanghai, Fukui and Terasaki, all attended the funeral. After the cremation, the remains were placed in a container. The date for transporting them back to Japan has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Car Destroyed</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 10:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a Japanese armored vehicle drove out of 63 Huayuan on Jiangwan Road and, due to excessive speed, crashed into a Chinese public bus running between the North Railway Station and the city center.

It has also sent Deputy Director Liang Hejun to various provinces and cities to explain the matter to the banking and money industries. The Shanghai Bankers' and Money Dealers' Associations separately convened executive committee meetings yesterday to discuss implementation procedures and study the opinions raised by member firms, in order to compile them and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption.

Committee member Li Fusun and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou successively presented their opinions and discussed the written opinions submitted by the Banking Association and member banks. It was generally believed that there were many practical difficulties in implementing the income tax. It was decided to first hand it over to the executive committee members for research and to convene a temporary executive committee meeting again within the next week, inviting representatives from various banks to attend.

The chairman first reported that the government had approved the implementation of the income tax on interest from securities and savings deposits starting from October 1. At the autumn managers' meeting on September 19, the association proposed to organize an income tax research committee, deciding on nine members, with three recommended by the managers' meeting, three recommended from the executive committee members, and three recommended from the member representatives. The managers' meeting has now recommended Pei Yunqing, Wang Huailian, and Qian Yuansheng as committee members. The executive committee members were asked to recommend three members, and Liu Wuqiao, Lu Shuchen, and Yan Dayou were nominated on the spot. In addition, member Zhixiang et al. submitted opinions to be studied by the income tax research committee, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance in the hope that they will be adopted in the future. Finally, other cases were discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that it should be stipulated in the detailed rules for the implementation of the income tax that lump-sum pensions, retirement funds, and alimony used for savings and interest-taking should be exempt from taxation. The Ministry replied, "The chamber's thorough study of the provisional regulations on income tax and the detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional regulations on income tax is commendable. However, it is found that the income tax regulations stipulate tax exemption for pensions, retirement funds, and alimony for the disabled, laborers, and those unable to support themselves, originally to show consideration for the toiling masses. If such pensions, retirement funds, and alimony are lump-sum payments that generate interest, they have become a form of capital and are therefore not exempt from taxation. This matter is a matter of the legal system, and the detailed rules for implementation have already been promulgated and are scheduled to take effect on October 1, and it is inappropriate to change them rashly. The request should not be considered. This approval."</p>
<h3>Kawagoe to Remain in Beijing for the Time Being</h3>
<p>According to Japanese telegrams, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, will leave Beijing, suspend negotiations with Foreign Minister Zhang on the Sino-Japanese issue, and wait for President Chiang to return to Beijing before resuming negotiations. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about this at the information office of the Japanese Embassy. According to a representative of the office, Izumi, the Japanese Embassy has no such intention and has not received such instructions from the provinces. The rumors are inaccurate. However, Ambassador Kawagoe hopes to meet with President Chiang once he returns to Beijing from Guangdong.</p>

He hoped that people from all walks of life inside and outside Gansu Province would assist in the process. Chen has been serving in the financial sector for many years. He usually studies finance and management. Since he became the manager of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, he has made many achievements and has been deeply appreciated by the central government. He will be able to fully utilize his knowledge to thoroughly reorganize Gansu's finances and revitalize Gansu's rural finance.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Leaf Industry Association's Letter to the Tax Affairs Bureau: Request for Flexibility in Unified Purchase and Sale</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's proposal to implement unified control over the purchase and sale of tobacco leaves, the Tobacco Leaf Industry Association has been appealing to various parties for adjustments. Yesterday, they sent another letter to the Tax Affairs Bureau, requesting revisions to the proposed measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>First, Implement Unified Control Starting with Xuchang Tobacco</p>
<p>Our country's tobacco production is divided into two types. One is American tobacco, also known as "smoked tobacco" or "Yankee tobacco," which is artificially reprocessed and can be used for cigarettes. The producing areas are Xuchang in Henan, Qingzhou in Shandong, and Fuyang in Anhui. However, Qingzhou's entire crop is purchased by Japanese merchants. Xuchang produces 60 million dan annually, with a price of 60 yuan per dan and a tax of 10 yuan 004 fen 3 li. This raw material is supplied to domestic cigarette factories for manufacturing and is sufficient for self-sufficiency. The other type is called native tobacco, also known as "earth tobacco," which is sun-dried and can be used as pipe tobacco. The producing areas are widespread throughout the country, but it cannot be used for cigarettes. The Tax Affairs Bureau previously convened a meeting of tobacco leaf merchants, resulting in a decision to implement unified control first in the Xuchang area. The measures include: (1) Establishing a joint government-merchant purchasing and selling organization with a capital of 5 million to 10 million, named the "Tobacco Leaf Unified Control Joint Stock Company," with government and merchant shares split equally, or government 40% and merchants 60%, with the merchant shares split equally between Chinese and foreign merchants. If insufficient, the preparatory office will supplement it. (2) Seeking opinions on market organization and management, with merchants properly establishing and implementing regulations. (3) The preparatory office will discuss and determine the boundaries of administrative and business operations. (4) The Tobacco Leaf Unified Control implementation sequence will begin with a trial run in Xuchang, Henan.</p>
<p>Request to the Tax Affairs Bureau for Flexible Handling</p>
<p>Our city's Tobacco Leaf Industry Association sent a letter to the Tax Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the unified control of tobacco leaves, stating, "With utmost respect, on the 28th of last month, your bureau, acting on orders to prepare for the unified control of tobacco leaves, invited representatives from our association to participate in discussions. After respectfully listening to your insightful views, our representatives immediately convened a meeting of all members, adhering to the imperial will and conducting discussions. It was unanimously agreed that the government's move to regulate the production and sales of tobacco leaves, improve tobacco leaf quality, eliminate privately manufactured raw materials, develop legitimate commerce, and enrich national tax revenues through the unified control of tobacco leaves reflects the government's grand plan to benefit the nation and its people. Our industry should provide the utmost assistance and work together to achieve this goal. However, the establishment of a joint government-merchant purchasing and selling organization is purely for profit-making purposes and exceeds the administrative scope of the government's guidance and supervision of tobacco leaves. It is undeniable that the tobacco leaf industry has weak capital and is unable to participate. Even if it could participate, it would be inadvisable. Once this business organization with substantial capital is established, each tobacco leaf merchant with fragile economic strength will inevitably be eliminated. Even if a few can temporarily struggle to survive, they will have no business to conduct because tobacco leaf consumers will directly purchase from the large company. As a result, our long-standing tobacco leaf companies will be overthrown and unemployed due to the establishment of the joint government-merchant organization. The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people directly employed will be on the verge of extinction. Although the government has no intention of competing for profit with the people, tobacco merchants face the risk of total annihilation. Is this the government's original intention to protect merchants and benefit the people? In our humble opinion, if the government wants to achieve the goals of eliminating private manufacturing, enriching national taxes, regulating production and sales, and improving tobacco leaf quality, there are other ways besides the joint government-merchant purchasing and selling organization. If the government leads from above and merchants assist from below, working together, success is assured. We implore your bureau to consider the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly employed in our industry and to abandon the idea of a joint government-merchant purchasing and selling organization. Under the principle that the government neither competes for profit with the people nor reduces tax revenue, while also not harming the interests of tobacco merchants, we can discuss measures and cooperate together. This is our sincere hope. We hereby submit this to the city and hope it will be accepted. We also request a reply."</p>
<h3>Female National Products Visiting Staff Begin Work Yesterday, Explaining the Purpose to Families</h3>
<p>The female visiting staff of the Shanghai National Products Promotion Association, including Xu Chengqing, Xu Songzi, Chen Yingfen, Lin Wen, and Shen Wenxian, began their visiting work yesterday. Ms. Xu and others, following the planned schedule, started their visits in the Yu Garden Road area of the Public Concession. The work proceeded smoothly throughout the day. To facilitate the work of the visiting staff and to show solemnity, the association specially explained the purpose of the visits to housewives, stating that "In recent years, the call for promoting national products has become increasingly enthusiastic. Under the major premise of protecting the country, people from all walks of life have mostly changed their views on foreign goods and are happy to use national products. This is truly a valuable phenomenon for the country. We often think that women are in charge of household affairs, and most of the household items are selected and purchased by women. Our female compatriots' patriotism will certainly not lag behind others. However, due to the inability to distinguish the authenticity of national products or unfamiliarity with the progress of national products, there are many cases of mistakenly purchasing foreign goods. Therefore, it was decided by public opinion to select and hire female visiting staff to go to families to talk, study with housewives to distinguish national products, and inquire about the housewives' criticisms of various national products, so that they can be passed on to the manufacturers for improvement. Our female compatriots understand the righteousness and will definitely agree with this initiative. We hereby state the purpose and request your consideration."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchant Huang Peng Returns to China to Establish Steel Factory</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Huang Peng, an overseas Chinese residing in Japan, has always been deeply concerned about the motherland and has spared no effort in promoting industry and selling national products. Recently, in view of the backwardness of domestic industries and the incalculable amount of money flowing abroad each year, he returned to China this year and gathered substantial capital to establish the Asia Steel Factory on Hejian Road in this city. He has purchased machinery and internal equipment worth more than 500,000 yuan, specializing in the mass production of Dragon Brand galvanized iron sheets. All who have purchased and used this brand of iron sheet have praised it. Yesterday, he invited more than a dozen celebrities from the political and business circles of this city, including Xie Zhongfu, a member of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Lu Zhixue, executive director of Wuzhou Pharmacy, Zhang Bentai, deputy manager of Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company, Xie Xiaochu, director of the design committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Qiu Hanping, general manager of the China Economic Cooperation Society, to visit the factory.

All the visitors praised it unanimously.</p>

It is reported that a large-scale entertainment show will soon be held, and all proceeds from the tickets will be used for donations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Economic Society Annual Meeting Opens Tomorrow, Members From All Over Report In, More Than Ten Papers Received</h3>
<p>The 13th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is scheduled to open tomorrow at 9:00 AM at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, and Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of this city, have all agreed to speak at the meeting. The attending representatives have already reported in yesterday, with an estimated 200 people attending. More than ten papers have been received from Ma Yinchu, Chen Xing, Li Quanshi, Zhang Sumin, Dong Xiujia, Chen Changxun, and others. All of them discuss fiscal and economic issues during extraordinary times. The central issue of the debate has been set as "Should China's new financial policy focus on stabilizing domestic prices or stabilizing foreign prices?" It is also presumed that Chen Guangfu will be the chairman, but Mr. Chen is currently stranded in Wuhan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>In ancient times, people used literature to make friends. In modern times, academic groups gather for meetings, and the intention is similar. Since its establishment, the Society has held annual meetings in various places for more than ten years, all of which have been welcomed by local people and valued by all sectors of the country. The Board of Directors decided to follow the resolution of the previous annual meeting and chose Shanghai as the location for the 13th Annual Meeting of Members. Its significance is undoubtedly important. In today's difficult times, the economic crisis is no less than the political one. Since the Society is committed to studying economics, it is our unshirkable responsibility to save the country from decline. Therefore, in the center of domestic finance and industry, we gather the members of the society to conduct a collective brainstorming session. The scope of the papers will be economic and financial issues during extraordinary times, and the topic of the debate will be new financial policies. It is believed that there will be insightful opinions that can inspire and awaken people. Whether in terms of the country and society or in terms of academic thought, there will be many benefits. Moreover, Shanghai is ranked fifth in the world, with convenient transportation by water and land. Talented people from all over the world gather here. The industry and finance lead the country, and the cultural construction can serve as a model. It is appropriate to visit and learn from it. If you find the Bund of Shanghai to be too secular, then the famous mountains of Wu are nearby. You can broaden your horizons and enjoy the scenery. A grand meeting is not always held, and a good opportunity should not be missed. All my comrades, why not come? I am sending you a brief note to invite you to the meeting.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>The staff for the annual meeting have been presumed as follows: A. Annual Meeting Preparatory Committee: Wang Zhixin, Wang Yunwu, Song Hanzhang, He Dekui, Li Fuxun, Li Quanshi, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Yongzuo, Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Chen Zeqing, Ma Suchu, Fu Rulin, Li Zhaozun, Pan Xulun, Qian Xinzhi, etc. B.

<h3>Two Chiefs of the Ministry of Railways Return to Shanghai From Guangdong Yesterday Morning, Report Everything to Zhang Gongquan, No Definite Date for Huang Shaoxiong's Return to the North</h3>
<p>Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Railways, and Chen Qingwen, Director of the Business Department, went to Guangzhou a few days ago to attend the reorganization meeting of the Yuehan Railway and inspect the heavy conditions of the railway. They returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning at 8:30 AM aboard the President Taft of the Dollar Steamship Company. They immediately went to see Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, to report everything, and they are scheduled to return to Beijing to take up their duties within one or two days. The rumor that Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai on the same ship is not true. It is also said that Huang returned to the north on the Empress of Canada, but this is even less likely, as the ship is currently sailing to Japan. There is currently no definite date for Huang's departure to the north.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Requests Reduction in the Price of Party and National Flags, Submits to the Ministry of the Interior for Early Implementation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Federation, because the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau had previously set the price too high, making it impossible for citizens to purchase, had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of the Interior for a reduction. The ministry replied that it had consulted with the Central Propaganda Department and would not reduce the price, but the bureau has not yet lowered the price. It has again submitted a request to the ministry, strictly ordering the bureau to lower the price as soon as possible to facilitate citizen purchases. The original petition is recorded below: "Petition for a request, according to a report from the Fourth Branch of the Federation, it is stated that the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau has recently sent personnel to the district to promote the sale of Party and National flags. However, due to the high price, most citizens are unable to purchase them, and it is requested that the authorities be contacted to reduce the price. Regarding the issue of the selling price of Party and National flags, the ministry had previously instructed that it had consulted with the Central Propaganda Department to reduce the price. However, according to reports, the price remains high. It is reasonable to petition the ministry, strictly ordering the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau to lower the price as soon as possible to promote widespread adoption, which is extremely important."</p>

<h3>Kidnapped Child's Alertness, Escaped by Calling for Help Midway, Small Hostage Kidnapped From Qingpu, Kidnappers Detained and Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cao Abao, a native of Pudong, is a boatman living at No. 210, Xinji浜 Road. On the 20th of this month, Cao and his accomplices, armed with weapons, kidnapped Yun Xiangyun's son, Jin Da (age 12), from the Qingpu Third District. It was around 10:00 PM. Yun's child was first taken to Songjiang, then taken by his accomplices, Chen Aqiu and two others, to Shanghai by boat. They landed at the South Pier, took a rickshaw, passed through Xiaodongmen, changed to a tram, and took them to Cao's house on Xinji浜 Road, preventing them from going out. At the same time, they sent a letter to his father demanding 1,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, at 9:10 AM, Cao left home for business. His concubine, Gao Gu Shi, from Suzhou, did not know that Yun's child was a hostage. She went to the Xiaocai Market on Zhoujiazui Road to shop, taking the child and her daughter, Xiao Mao, together. While passing near Tongzhou Road on Dongyouheng Road, they happened to meet Yang Xinzheng, a Chinese detective from the Jiashang Road Police Station, Detective Chen, and a patrolling policeman. Yun's child, alert, shouted that he was kidnapped. The detectives questioned the child and learned the details. They arrested Gao Gu Shi and went to her house to arrest Cao Abao. Cao confessed that his accomplice, Chen Aqiu, was hiding in Room 11, Zhangjia Alley, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Detective Yang then went to the address together with the Public Security Bureau to arrest Chen and take him into custody. Cao Abao, Gao Gu Shi, and the daughter Xiao Mao were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Engineering Bureau, explained the case and requested an adjournment. According to the small hostage, Yun Jin Da, the first defendant, Cao Abao, had a gun that night. The two defendants stuttered when questioned, and Judge Zhong Qing ordered that they be returned to custody separately and rescheduled for further verification. The girl Gao Xiao Mao was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for foster care.</p>
<h3>Pacific Association: Celebration of the Discovery of the Pacific; President Kung Hsiang-hsi Attends and Delivers Speech; Hopes for Increased Friendship Among Pacific Rim Countries; Kuo Ping-wen Lectures on China's International Relations</h3>
<p>The Pacific Association held a meeting at the Cathay Hotel yesterday at noon to commemorate the 423rd anniversary of the Spanish explorer Balboa's discovery of the Pacific Ocean and to foster friendly relations. Speeches were given by Kung Hsiang-hsi, Kuo Ping-wen, and others, making it a grand occasion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending</p>
<p>Among those attending yesterday were over two hundred people, including envoys and consuls stationed in Shanghai, Chinese and foreign guests, and members. Chairman Hilmy Effendi delivered the opening remarks and reported on the congratulatory telegram from the Honolulu Pacific Association.</p>
<p>Kung's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Association President Kung Hsiang-hsi delivered a speech, translated into English by Chen Bingzhang. He stated, in essence: "On behalf of China, I am very honored to welcome everyone to this celebration of the discovery of the Pacific Ocean. Chairman Hilmy Effendi mentioned that the Chinese had already discovered the Pacific before the Spanish explorer Balboa. At that time, transportation was blocked, and international relations were very distant. Today, when we commemorate Balboa, we should not only commemorate his discovery of the Pacific but also hope for friendly and peaceful relations among the countries along the Pacific Rim. When Balboa discovered the Pacific, he did not anticipate today's development and changes. Today, the countries along the Pacific have become close neighbors. Due to political and economic ties, since the European war, the area has become one of the most important regions on Earth, known as the Pacific Century. Therefore, when we commemorate Balboa, we especially hope that the countries along the Pacific Rim will not engage in competition and division but will strive for cooperation and peace, which aligns with the Pacific Association's mission." Subsequently, the Swiss Consul-General, representing the consular corps in the city, delivered a congratulatory speech.</p>
<p>Kuo's Lecture</p>
<p>Following this, Shanghai Association President Kuo Ping-wen delivered a lecture on "China's Current International Relations," stating, in essence: "In the past, due to geographical, cultural, and other factors, China overestimated itself, and transportation between East and West was not yet convenient, leading to isolation and difficulties in the early development of Sino-foreign relations. However, today, land, sea, and air transportation have developed rapidly, and the past barriers have disappeared. China's disputes, economic, and cultural relations with friendly nations have become closer. Furthermore, China is actively pursuing reform, and unequal treaties that hindered China's sovereignty in the past are now being revised. In recent years, concessions and leased territories have been returned, and treaties based on equality and mutual benefit have been repeatedly signed. At the same time, the Chinese government is also working to adjust diplomatic relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. In terms of culture, since the opening of maritime transport, China's absorption of other cultures has kept pace with the times. In recent years, Western countries have also made significant progress in the study of Chinese culture, such as poetry, songs, drama, art, and so on. Economically, in recent years, due to the development of various transportation and industrial enterprises, China has become one of the world's most important markets for machinery and industrial raw materials. This point has attracted the close attention of various countries. At the same time, with the recent boom in domestic construction, industrial development, agricultural improvement, and quality enhancement, China's exports will also make significant progress, it can be asserted. Now, let me analyze the individual relationships between China and important countries. China and Britain have always maintained friendly relations. The newly appointed Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has a far-sighted view. I believe that he will make greater contributions to promoting Sino-British relations. The relationship between China and the United States has been harmonious for more than 150 years. During my recent visit to the United States to study international trade, the impressions I gained were also very good. As for China and Japan, due to their shared culture and ethnicity, there is indeed a need for coexistence and co-prosperity. However, the realization of friendly relations between the two countries depends on mutual deep understanding and frank and sincere consultation. Economic cooperation is also welcome, but it must be based on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty. I recently saw an article by Mr. Sogawa Shinji in a Tokyo dispatch, which stated: 'If we hope that China and Japan will join hands to consolidate peace in East Asia and enhance the well-being of the two peoples, and Japan hopes that China will change its attitude towards Japan, then the direction of Japan's national policy should also be changed.' This is truly an insightful view. It can be seen that the Japanese intellectual community is deeply aware that improving its policy towards China is the most important task at present. The improvement of relations between the two countries in the future will also depend on this. As for China's attitude towards the goals of the League of Nations, it has always expressed sympathy. For more than ten years, it has enthusiastically participated in various undertakings of the League of Nations. Although some people have recently been disappointed with the League of Nations, the League of Nations is not a supreme government but only a permanent organization in international life that contains significant moral force. Therefore, the Chinese government continues to cooperate closely with the League of Nations. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly sent specialists to serve in the League of Nations office to promote various economic, political, and technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations. Due to time constraints today, I am unable to discuss various international relations and the work of various organizations in detail, but I firmly believe that the enhancement of friendship between countries must be based on mutual understanding. The purpose of this association now is to promote friendly relations between China and other Pan-Pacific countries. Today, we are holding a commemorative banquet for the discovery of the Pacific, and we should have a clearer understanding. I have expressed my thoughts and feelings and humbly request your guidance and encourage each other. I hope that everyone will contribute to the best of their ability, how fortunate that would be."</p>
<h3>Kidnappers in Xue Jiasheng Case Attempted to Kidnap Lu Fengyu; Discovered During Firearm Inspection; Five Kidnappers Sent to Special Court No. 1</h3>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, son of the deceased wealthy merchant of pigments, Xue Baorun, was kidnapped on August 1. The legal police have arrested the kidnappers in this case: Chen Jintang, Bu Ming, Wu Genyou, Sun Yanan, Pu Yaozhang, and others. Four firearms were confiscated and they were sent to Special Court No. 2 for questioning, judgement; Chen was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, Bu to life imprisonment, Wu to 12 years imprisonment, and Sun and Pu were acquitted. Now it is learned that Li Shizhong, a Chinese detective from the Zhabei Police Station, and detective mother Ding Huaguo, found that Chen Jintang and others had also committed a kidnapping case in the Public Concession. Therefore, yesterday they went to Special Court No. 2 and transferred Chen and the other four to the police station for custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of Special Court No. 1, requesting permission for detention. Zhang Tianyin, the police's lawyer, stated that the defendants were arrested for kidnapping Xue Jiasheng in the French Concession, and four firearms were confiscated, including a Ning brand Wang pistol, which was found to be related to the kidnapping of Lu Fengyu. Lu Fengyu was in the tobacco business and lived at 360 Connaught Road. On June 12th of this year, at approximately 3:00 AM, Lu went from the Vienna Ballroom to the Saint Anna Garden Ballroom. After dancing, he and the dancers Zhou Juanjuan, Dong Hailun, and Lin Meimei rode in a private car No. 39. They first sent Zhou Juanjuan to Junfu Lane on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, then sent the two dancers, Dong and Lin, to 48 Lane 630 Avenue Haig. Suddenly, two kidnappers dressed in black ordered the car to stop and fired two shots as a warning. The bullets hit the car's glass window, and the glass shards injured the Russian bodyguard's body. The car stopped, and the kidnappers dragged Lu Fengyu out of the car and put him in the kidnappers' car No. 3742. However, the car door was not closed, and Lu jumped out of the car from the opposite door to escape. The kidnappers then fired two shots at him, injuring Lu, and drove away, abandoning the kidnap victim. Subsequently, the police transported the injured to the hospital and found that the license plate of the kidnappers' car No. 3741 was fake. The license plate belonged to the Old Zhabei Police's car. The police are now investigating in detail, so please approve the detention. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the report and ordered that Chen Jintang and the other four be detained until October 3 for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Maternal Heart Hospital Opens Today; Founded by Lu Bohong and Others; Special Free Clinic Established</h3>
<p>The Zhabei area is vast with many residents, mostly from the laboring class. Although there are several hospitals in the area, they are still insufficient. In view of this, Lu Bohong, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business and charity circles, acquired more than 20 mu of land in the Niuqiaowan area of North Baoxing Road in Zhabei to build the Maternal Heart Hospital. The necessary funds were provided by Lu from his 60th birthday gifts from friends and relatives. The shortfall was supplemented by Lu personally and by donations from enthusiastic philanthropists. The preparation has taken two years, and the entire project has now been completed. The design of the building and the internal layout are extremely complete. The chief physician is Dr. Song Wusheng, a well-known figure in the medical field. The resident physicians are Zeng Xianming and others. The nurses are graduates of the Italian Sisters' Royal Hospital, which is a distinctive feature. All affairs are managed by Lu's fourth son, Zengzuo. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM today. An invitation to visit was issued in advance and Mayor Wu will be invited to inaugurate it. It is heard that the hospital has now begun accepting patients and has established a special number of free treatment slots to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>After the Tan Zhuohong Case Occurred, Xu Yi and Li Quanshen Believed That the Case Had Been Lost; Li Was Suspected of Bribery</h3>
<p>Lawyer Xu Yi, also known as Jingxian, is the nephew-in-law of Cheng Linsheng's wife and Cheng Li Tianzhi. In October of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Xu fabricated a letter of authorization stating that Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Tianzhi's younger brother, Li Hairong (also known as Quanshen), appointed him as their year-round legal counsel. The contract stipulated a public fee of 20,000 taels. Xu then sent a letter to Li Tianzhi and Li Hairong, demanding the public fee and its interest, totaling more than 37,000 yuan. However, the Lis stated that they had not signed</p>
<p>the contract</p>
<p>and hired Li Shirui (deceased) and Yang Shaopeng as lawyers to sue Xu Yi in the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for forging documents. Prosecutor Li Fen filed a public prosecution, which was heard by criminal court judge Tan Zhuohong, who sentenced Xu to four months' imprisonment. Xu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court, which resulted in an acquittal. In another case, Xu was sued by Li Quanshen in Special Court No. 1 and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment. Therefore, Tan tried to involve Judge Ben and lawyer Yang Shaopeng in</p>
<p>demanding bribes</p>
<p>After the case occurred, Xu Yi stated that the case in which Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanshen sued him in the District Court was heard by Judge Tan Zhuohong, and the lawyer hired by the Lis was Yang Shaopeng. Moreover, in public prosecution cases, there is no need to hire a lawyer, and in the incidental civil suit, Yang's public fee even reached a huge amount of 4,000 gold. This public fee clearly shows a major suspicion of bribery. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit against Li Quanshen in</p>
<p>Special Court No. 1</p>
<p>yesterday afternoon for jointly committing bribery. Judge Feng Shide opened Criminal Court No. 1 and summoned Li Quanshen, accompanied by his defense lawyer Li Lin, to the court. According to Li's statement, the case in which he sued Xu Yi in the District Court was handled by lawyer Li Shirui, who was hired by my sister Cheng Li Tianzhi. However, because lawyer Li suffered from hemoptysis, he might not be able to appear in court at the time, so lawyer Li introduced lawyer Yang Shaopeng to jointly represent him. However, this matter was entirely handled by Hu Zhetin, the accountant of Cheng Linsheng, and the letter of authorization was also signed by Hu on his behalf. I</p>
<p>did not pay a single cent</p>
<p>of the public fee. I also did not pay a single cent of my Lang Li Shirui's public fee of 6,000 yuan. The reason why Xu Yi has repeatedly entangled me in lawsuits is actually to avoid serving his sentence in prison and to spend his days in the detention center. Because the days spent in the detention center can be deducted from the sentence. My sister Li Tianzhi currently lives at 296 Avenue Joffre, and Hu Zhetin lives at 796 Avenue Haig. Xu's accusation has no basis in fact. Judge Feng then ordered that the case be rescheduled to summon Li Tianzhi to testify and then re-examined. Xu Yi had sued Hu Zhetin in the Wuxian District Court for the same crime, but the court has now ruled that it has no jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Five Thieves Arrested in the Shangbin Hotel; One Thief Had Been Imprisoned for Five Years</h3>
<p>At 12:00 AM the night before last, Liu Bingrong, a detective from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Corps, received a tip-off that a gang of thieves led by Sun Yiren was preparing to rob a nunnery at the intersection of Song Park Road and Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. Captain Liu Huai immediately reported to Director Cai Jingjun, who dispatched Inspector Xi Zhijian, together with Captain Liu and detectives Liu Yumei, Zhang Sen, Ye Jiliang, and others, to the New Zhabei Branch and the Hengfeng Road Police Station. They successively arrested five thieves in Room 3 of the Shangbao Hotel on Hengfeng Road and Zhongxing Road. They were immediately taken to the Corps for questioning regarding their age and background, as follows: (1) Chen Baokun, 28 years old, from Guixian County, Guangxi, residing at Taixingli, Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Nanshi; (2) Sheng Liuan, 40 years old, from Hanshan County, Anhui, residing at 78 Yongfuli, Hongzhen; (3) Zhang Shaoyun, 34 years old, from Henan, residing at Room 3, Shangbao Hotel, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei; (4) Sun Yiren, 25 years old, from Siyang, residing at the same address, previously imprisoned for five years for robbery; (5) Li Deyi, 42 years old, from Nanjing, residing at 86 Haining Road in the British Concession, confessed to multiple robberies. Two pistols are said to be with Wang Xiaoadzi, who is on the run, and Mr. Shen, who drives the car.</p>
<h3>Teacher's Bestial Act; Sentenced to Ten Years</h3>
<p>Liu Zhen, 26 years old, from Haimen, was addicted to prostitution and lived at 1040 Avenue Edward VII. He was not yet married. Recently, he served as a teacher at the Shanghai Private Elementary School at 86 Renshouli, Beikaier Road. He did not repent of his old ways and contracted gonorrhea. In the school, there was Zhi Zhen (9 years old), the daughter of Jiang Tang, a Ningbo woman from 500 Tonglu. She was very beautiful. Teacher Liu often joked with her after class. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month, after all the students were dismissed from class, Liu's bestial desires arose. He lured her to a small room, used sweet words to take off her pants, and committed rape. Afterwards, he threatened her not to tell. He raped her four times in total. The girl was young and ignorant and did not dare to tell her mother when she returned home. It was not until the morning of the 20th that Mrs. Jiang noticed and, after strict questioning, she revealed the truth. Upon examining the girl's lower body, it was found to be severely swollen. She reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Liu Chunshu and Liu Zhisheng to arrest the animal-like teacher Liu and send him to the Shanghai First Special District Court. The Public Works Department lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of raping a young girl under Article 221, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment. Judge Zhong Qing, because the case concerned public morals, prohibited onlookers. The result was that he was remanded in custody awaiting sentencing. This morning, he appeared in Criminal Court No. 3 for a retrial and clarification. Liu Zhen was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Double Corpse Case at Women's Hospital; Police Intensively Arresting the Culprit; Both Culprits Were Not Officially Licensed Physicians; Hospital Specially Entrusted Others to Perform Abortions</h3>
<p>Since the double corpse case occurred at the Hongkou Women's Hospital, the male and female perpetrators in the case, Zhang Wenhua and Liang Meiyu, have both fled without a trace. The police initially arrested Fei Wangshi, a servant at the hospital, but released him after finding no connection. The day before yesterday, Liang Meiyu's younger brother, Chen Pengfei, was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, Chinese detectives Huang Fugen and Cui Chengke, who are handling the case, have found that Zhang Wenhua had worked as a nurse at Baolong Hospital for three years, but he was not an officially licensed doctor. Recently, he registered with the Municipal Health Bureau under the name Gu Qing. It was found that Gu Qing was a graduate of the Tongji University Medical School. An investigation at the school revealed that Gu Qing, a native of Wuxi, was 33 years old and graduated in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). He has been dead for three years. Zhang Wenhua clearly impersonated him. It was also found that Liang Meiyu's original name was Chen Xiao and she worked as a female nurse at Guangren Hospital. She is also likely not an officially licensed physician. It was also found that the main business of the Hongkou Women's Hospital was to perform abortions for others, with the price usually being 30 yuan, but it also depended on the status of the patient. It is possible that the female corpse entrusted an abortion, the surgery was not good, and she was injured and died. The police are now spreading out secret agents, hoping to capture Zhang and Liang.</p>

<h3>Chinese-Run Horse Riding School Established</h3>
<p>The Vientiane Riding School at the intersection of Lincoln Road and Zhongshan Road in this city was founded by Chinese. After several months of preparation, it is scheduled to open at 8:00 AM on the 27th of this month. Pre-issued invitations are being sent to invite guests.

<h3>The Truth of the Box Corpse Case is Fully Revealed; The Murderer Has Already Confessed; The Judge Personally Went to the Police Station for Detailed Questioning; Revisited the Scene of the Incident for Investigation and Inspection; Neighbors Insist That There Was No Resident, Which is Suspicious</h3>
<p>Regarding the box corpse case, because Lin Gendi, Mao Agen, and Jiang Yuantan, who were arrested, suddenly fully admitted in court and then overturned their confessions, claiming that it was caused by being subjected to torture at the police station, Judge Zhong Qing, who is handling the case, in order to discover the truth, went to the Hongkou Police Station at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, accompanied by the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu and others, and ordered Mao Agen to be brought in for questioning. Mao suddenly directly admitted that Jiang Yuantan first chopped Cai Ying's neck with two axes, and then he chopped off Cai Ying's legs, while Lin Gendi first pressed Cai Ying's mouth and then helped dismember the corpse. After the dismemberment was completed, all the bloody clothes and Cai Ying's clothes were taken away by Gendi. He also admitted that he stayed with Gendi at the Zhonghua Hotel that night. Jiang Yuantan was then brought in and also fully admitted that he had chopped off Cai Ying's head. Lin Gendi was then brought in and said that he only saw Jiang chopping the head with an axe, and then ran out. Cai Ying's bloody clothes were brought to the hotel by Mao. He asked me if I wanted them, but I said no. He then agreed to make a new set of clothes. He denied helping to dismember the corpse. At that time, the three defendants had a strong dispute over this point. Lin Gendi even kowtowed to the sky to show his sincerity. After a very long time, Judge Zhong then went to the scene of the incident, the third floor of 3 Cunfuli, White Paul Road, to investigate. He searched everywhere and found no trace. According to a Mr. So-and-so from the second floor next door, no one lived in that room, and no call girl named Cai Ying lived there. Only an old woman from his family was temporarily living in that room. The bed board taken away by the police belonged to his family. However, Lin, Mao, and Jiang all claimed that they killed Cai Ying in that room, which is very strange. Judge Zhong then returned to the court after the investigation was completed, and it was already dusk.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th of this month, Special Court No. 2 escorted two robber prisoners, Wu Asan and Wang Agen, from the legal police to the waiting room behind the First Tribunal. At about 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, the two prisoners, Wu and Wang, took advantage of the legal police's negligence and opened the back door, broke the iron bars on the iron bucket, and escaped.

When he returned to the court, he first went to the writing room to register the prisoner. When he returned to the First Tribunal, he found that the prisoners had escaped. He did not forget the key in the lock hole of the back door. Although the key was in his charge, it was always hung on the window in front of the waiting room, and all the legal police could take it off and open the door to escort the prisoners, etc. The court also summoned the 141st legal police officer for questioning, ordered the debate to begin, and then announced the conclusion, awaiting the actual judgment. Jiang was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiping Arrested; Detained and Sent to Court for Preliminary Inquiry</h3>
<p>Wang Jiping, from Chongming, 18 years old, used to study at a certain school in this city. Later, due to the amputation of one foot, he dropped out of school and became a newspaper seller.

<h3>Businesses on Hujiamu Bridge Petition to Relocate the Vegetable Market to Benefit Merchants and Peddlers</h3>
<p>The businesses on Hujia Bridge Road had previously submitted petitions to the Public Security, Health, Finance, Social Affairs, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus, requesting the relocation of vegetable stalls to maintain the commercial district, but they have not been approved. Yesterday, Zhou Senmao, Dasheng, Zengda, Yongshengtai, Nanyang, Taichang, Guangchang, and other businesses jointly stamped and submitted a petition to the Fourth District Party Department. The original text reads: "Petition regarding the decline of the market, sluggish business, lack of maintenance, and difficult living conditions, requesting the relocation of the Tianbao Branch Road vegetable market to this road to benefit merchants and peddlers. The undersigned businesses are all engaged in business in the Hujiamu Bridge area. Since September 18th, the market has been depressed year after year, coupled with the economic panic. Those who cannot stand on this road are following each other's footsteps. Empty closed shops are everywhere. Without any rescue measures, we are bound to sit and wait for death. The Tianbao Branch Road vegetable market was ordered by the Public Security Bureau to move to the Tiande Road area for business. Although it is in the process of being implemented, the vendors believe that the Tiande Road area is remote and their livelihoods are difficult. There is an intention to request relocation to this road. Several petitions have been filed with various bureaus, but no approval has been received. Now, the undersigned businesses, for the sake of maintaining the market, in addition to submitting separate petitions to the Health, Social Affairs, Public Security, Public Utilities, Finance, and Public Works Bureaus, and the Linping Road Police Station, also earnestly request your department to review and forward to the relevant authorities for approval to relocate the Tianbao Road vegetable market to the Hujiaqiao Road area, from Xiangyan Bridge to Tiantong Road Bridge, which will benefit both the vendors and the market. The Lvhujiao Road area is neither a major road for traffic nor is there any other obstruction. If you approve, we will be immensely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Fourth District Party Department of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3>Public Concession Vehicle Committee Member Zhu Maocheng Answers Questions; Discusses Reducing the Number of Vehicles</h3>
<p>The problem of rickshaws in the Public Concession has become tense again since the Public Concession Bureau decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws by 484 starting in March next year. Rickshaw owners have strongly opposed it, and opinions from all walks of life are also quite divided. However, the Public Concession Bureau authorities do not seem to have made a clear statement on the purpose and method of this decision to reduce the number of vehicles. The following is an excerpt of a conversation between Zhu Maocheng, a member of the Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee, and a guest about the reduction of vehicles.</p>
<p>Purpose and Method of Reducing Vehicles</p>
<p>(Guest asks, same below) What is the purpose of the Public Concession Bureau reducing the number of vehicles, and what is the method? (Answer) Regardless of the traffic aspect, the current number of public rickshaws in the concession is actually too many in terms of the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers. In fact, the current income of rickshaw pullers per shift, after paying the rickshaw rent, is very low. This is generally recognized by all walks of life, but the method of increasing their income is not very clear. It must be known that the total daily income of all rickshaw businesses in the concession is a certain amount of money. The more vehicles there are, the less income each rickshaw puller has. The logic is very clear. Therefore, one reasonable way to increase the income of each rickshaw puller is to reduce the number of existing rickshaws. At the same time, in consideration of the impact on rickshaw owners, the Public Concession Bureau has decided to reduce only 484 out of 9,984 vehicles starting on March 1 next year, to show sympathy. Although rickshaw owners will suffer a slight loss, the income of rickshaw pullers, if there are no unexpected developments, will increase by 5%.</p>
<p>Registering Rickshaw Pullers Will Not Cause Unemployment</p>
<p>(Question) Outsiders say that this decision to reduce vehicles will cause more than a thousand people to lose their jobs. What is your opinion? (Answer) This kind of speculation is not accurate, because according to the situation in recent years, only registered rickshaw pullers can pull rickshaws. Therefore, whether the number of vehicles is reduced or not, it has no relationship with unregistered rickshaw pullers. As for registered rickshaw pullers, according to the current plan of the Public Concession Bureau, there is no need to worry about unemployment. This is because the number of vehicles that the Public Concession Bureau has decided to reduce will be carried out within the scope of the natural reduction of registered rickshaw pullers. The so-called natural reduction refers to the number of people reduced due to death, old age, weakness, and change of profession. Among them, those who have been proven by the Public Concession Bureau are allowed to be supplemented. However, there are also a large number of people who are not known clearly. The exact number will be determined after the public rickshaw pullers in February next year have renewed their licenses. Therefore, under this situation, rickshaw pullers really have no worries about unemployment.</p>
<p>There Is No Intention to Destroy Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>(Question) Outsiders say that reducing rickshaws has the suspicion of destroying the rickshaw business run by Chinese people and supporting the development of foreign tram and bus companies. What is your opinion? (Answer) This kind of rumor is really absurd, and sensible people will not believe it. In fact, rickshaws and trams and buses have long been impossible to compete with. Wherever there are trams and buses, rickshaws have long been unpopular with the public, especially in terms of distance. For example, when we go from Jing'an Temple to the Bund, in terms of car price and time, we always like to take a bus, and rarely hire a rickshaw. Whether the number of public rickshaws in the concession is 9,984 or 9,500, there is no impact on this point. In short, under the current phenomenon of supply exceeding demand for vehicles, rickshaw pullers will inevitably compete with each other for customers. As a result, everyone will not be able to eat their fill. Therefore, for the sake of the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, the best way is to slightly reduce the number of vehicles within the limit of the natural reduction of rickshaw pullers, so that it is close to the number needed by the public, and rickshaw pullers can also enjoy the minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>The Work of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society</p>
<p>Finally, when asked about the work of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, the answer was that recently, newspapers have often published criticisms from other circles about the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, saying that it is of no benefit to rickshaw pullers, so the true value of the society is unknown to the outside world, which is a pity. On this point, I don't need to defend it. It is best for those who are interested in all circles to go to visit in person. Although there are places where the Mutual Aid Society needs to be improved, a fair observer, in view of the large scope of the Society's work, will inevitably regard it as the only labor welfare organization in the Far East. For example, from the 7th to the 13th of this month, within a week, rickshaw pullers attended the Society to participate in the meeting 64,837 times, including 3,914 people who went to the clinic to see a doctor, 24 people who asked a doctor to come out to see a doctor, 156 people who were served by itinerant nurses, 155 people who were treated in the Society's hospital, 356 people who were sent to other hospitals for treatment, 163 people who received reproductive guidance, 3,154 people who read books and listened to lectures, 15,555 people who listened to lectures and read books, 279 times of giving rice and funeral expenses to members and their families, 6 members' families who received death insurance, 13,602 people who bathed, 20,047 people who drank tea, and 22 cases of requesting mediation of disputes. These works are all approved by the real rickshaw pullers. At the beginning of May this year, there were as many as 30,000 rickshaw pullers who individually voted in favor of the work of the Society and expressed their willingness to pay membership fees in a few days.</p>
<h3>Western Paint Industry Lawsuit: Settle Accounts After Disaster Relief; Directors Do Not Manage Accounts, When to Investigate; Ignoring a Difference of Hundreds of Thousands</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association sent representative Ma Shangjie and appointed a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, and Le Gengrong of mismanaging the property of the Foreign Goods Commercial Association. The court has repeatedly held hearings to summon the parties, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, Judge Chen Shuoying presided over the continued hearing in the criminal court. Both parties, accompanied by lawyers, appeared in court. The court first asked Ma Shangjie, "Which lawyers represent which defendants?" The plaintiff Ma said, "I represent Qin Dongliang and Chen Gengsheng." Lawyers Cao Kun and Hua Danhua said, "I represent Wang Zuolin, Hu Tongsheng, and Xia Gengsheng." Lawyer He Xiaoyuan said, "I represent Ding Fang'e, Dong Yuzhen, and Su Xiangxuan." Then Le Zhenbao was questioned. The court ordered them to submit the title deed and account books. Zhang Lanping first submitted a title deed (French Concession deed) to the court. Then, the defendant's defense lawyer, Li Zuyu, submitted two account books for the years 1933, 1934, and 1935. He also said that the defendants were directors and did not manage the accounts. The account books for the three years were submitted by the association's accountant, surnamed Feng. The court asked the plaintiff's side, "You requested to investigate the accounts from the establishment of the association until now. Why are only three years of account books submitted?" Li said, "The court did not specify which year's account books to investigate. However, the plaintiff must point out the specific facts of the defendant's embezzlement. After proof, the defendant can submit them. The accusations made by the plaintiff are empty and groundless. On what basis can the accounts be investigated?" The court said, "That is because the court ordered the submission of the accounts for the convenience of investigating the evidence." The court also asked Ma Shangjie, "Your accusation that the defendants have embezzled funds from the establishment of the association until now is too vague. You must present the facts of which year and which item." Ma replied, "In 1932, according to the standing chairman of the Western Paint Association, Chuan Jiemei of Gonghe Lai Paint Company, and Li Shuyan, the property in the association differed by more than 100,000. Later, we requested to investigate the accounts and receive income and expenditure reports, but they were ignored. Now, the defendants have submitted the account books, but they are missing two items: current account and miscellaneous items, and rent collection account. We will now investigate the accounts from 1912 to the present." Le Zhenbao and Zhang Lanping said together, "The association is not a store and does not have a current account or miscellaneous items. The current account is in the rolling account, and the miscellaneous items are in the total account. There is a separate account book for rent collection. If the court wants to see it, it can be submitted." At this point, the court ordered that the accounts submitted today were incomplete and there was nothing to question. The account books from 1912 onwards should be submitted to the court for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Investigators Using Torture in the French Concession; Gong Renfa Falsely Accuses a Good Person of Theft; Wu Xiaogouzi Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>Wu Jiangfu, 53 years old, from Danyang, lives at No. 101 Xilin Road, Nanshi, and makes a living as a peddler. Wu's son, Wu Xiaogouzi, is 14 years old. Wu sent him to Yang Binglan (35 years old, from Zhenjiang), a tanner at No. 49 Olliehe Road in the French Concession, as an apprentice. Yang lives in the house and is a second landlord. On the 13th of this month, Xi Renfa rented Yang's pavilion room, agreeing to a monthly rent of five yuan. Xi moved in for nine days without paying the rent. Suddenly, on the afternoon of the 22nd, at about 4:00 PM, he claimed that Wu Xiaogouzi, Yang Binglan's apprentice, had stolen five yuan in banknotes and reported it to the French Police Station. A police officer surnamed Wang was dispatched to investigate and took Yang Binglan and Wu Xiaogouzi, master and apprentice, to the police station for questioning. They were released at about 9:00 PM that night. Yang and Wu, master and apprentice, were injured in the police station and went to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yang's injury was minor and he was discharged. Wu Xiaogouzi's injury was serious, with chills and fever, swelling all over his body, and mental disorder. His life may be in danger. The next day, Wu Jiangfu reported to patrolman No. 466, who reported it to the police station. The police station sent personnel to investigate, first sending Wu Xiaogouzi to the hospital for treatment, and then detaining Gong Renfa, who instigated the false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for questioning. The police department's lawyer requested a postponement of the investigation. The judge briefly questioned the defendant, Xi Renfa, and ordered a postponement for further investigation. Yang Binglan and Wu Jiangfu hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court, requesting an examination of the injuries and accusing Xi and the investigators of falsely accusing a good person of theft, abusing their power, using illegal torture, and beating them into injury, requesting that they be punished according to law. The court will hold a hearing to summon the parties in the near future.</p>

<h3>Watch Industry Association Holds Public Training Business Registration</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Watch Industry Association moved to its new address at No. 9 Yuxing Lane, Nanjing Road, and hired Zheng Junzhan as its secretary, it has been determined to innovate, and has separately organized a special research committee to study industry regulations and stamp duty exemptions. Recently, in view of the importance of public training for strengthening the country and the race, it has specially appointed Zhang Lingxin, Mao Wenrong, and others to organize a public training committee and actively take responsibility for organizing it. It is heard that quite a few people in the industry have voluntarily signed up to join the training.

<h3>Public Concession Bureau Band Winter Concerts Begin; First Regular Concert on October 2</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been cool, especially at night.

It is heard that Mr. Baikai, the chief conductor of the Public Concession Bureau Band, has obtained the consent of the world-renowned cello expert Piatigorsky to participate in a solo performance. Mr. Bi's name has long been famous in Europe and the United States and has been warmly welcomed everywhere. This visit to China will only last a few days in Shanghai before he sets off for the United States. Therefore, this performance is a rare opportunity for music lovers in Shanghai. It is heard that the seat prices are set at two yuan and three yuan. Reservations can be made at Mou Deli Foreign Company and the French Concession Lyceum Theatre immediately.</p>

<h3>Shenxin No. 2 Factory Will Resume Production First; Chinese and Shanghai Banks Invest; Obstacles to the Resumption of Production at No. 5 Factory</h3>
<p>The Shenxin Textile Company's No. 2 and No. 5 textile factories on Yichang Road and Huade Road in this city have been closed for a year and a half since the lunar New Year last year. The two factories originally operated with mortgages from Chinese and Shanghai banks, so the company and the banks suffered losses after the closure. This year, the cotton outlook is optimistic, so the two sides are negotiating to resume production. A Central News Agency reporter learned that the No. 2 factory is invested by the Chinese and Shanghai banks, with Chinese accounting for 60% and Shanghai accounting for 40%. The company's proposal to the two banks to resume production has been approved. However, the factory's machinery and equipment are relatively old, and the factory buildings are also not neat. Therefore, it is hoped that it can start work at the same time as the No. 5 factory, which has newer equipment. However, the factory still has debts to the Yongfeng Money Shop. The bank has now stopped lending and is unwilling to continue investing, and requires that the money it has lent be repaid first, which the two banks are unwilling to do. If it wants to transfer the debt, there is no suitable buyer for a while. Therefore, the proposal to resume production at the same time has been obstructed. Yesterday, the company sent a letter to the two banks asking them to resume production at the No. 2 factory first. The two banks are currently studying it and said that they can accept it and will negotiate soon.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Local Bank Approved to Issue Subsidiary Coin Notes; 3 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Local Bank is a local bank with Zhejiang government shares. It was approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue banknotes and subsidiary coin notes. By the end of 1933, the amount of exchangeable notes issued was 1,352,457.9 yuan, of which the amount of subsidiary coin notes issued was 500,000 yuan. After the implementation of the government's new monetary policy, it was ordered to transfer the issuance reserves to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for acceptance. It was not until last month that the Hangzhou Branch of the Bank of China took over and transferred it to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee.</p>
<p>Ministry Approves Issuance</p>
<p>The bank believed that the Ministry of Finance stipulated that subsidiary coin notes should be issued by local banks in various provinces, so it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance through the Finance Department, requesting approval to issue new subsidiary coin notes of 8 million yuan. Finance Minister Cheng Yuanfan also visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to request results. The Ministry has approved the issuance of subsidiary coin notes of 3 million yuan, following the example of the Farmers Bank of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Stipulated Reserves</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Zhejiang Local Bank yesterday that the new subsidiary coin notes are divided into three types: 10 cents, 20 cents, and 50 cents. After the approval order from the Ministry of Finance is issued, a printing company will be entrusted to print them. The reserve fund for the issuance of subsidiary coin notes is 60% cash (i.e., legal tender from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications) and 40% mortgage (i.e., government bonds, etc.)</p>
<h3>Nantung Cotton Production Improvement Fee Collection; Ministry of Finance Will Correct It; Industrial Union Informed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Industrial Federation had previously submitted a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the collection of fees by the Cotton Production Improvement Office established in Yancheng, Jiangsu, be stopped because it violated the law. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued an instruction stating: "Telegram dated September 25, 1936, for the establishment of a cotton production improvement office in Nantong by the Jiangsu Construction Department, collecting 20 cents per load of cotton pieces, please stop it immediately. Informed by telegram. Please consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation and correction." This instruction was issued on September 24, 1936, by Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<h3>Change of General Secretary of the China Foreign Famine Relief Association</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, General Secretary of the China Foreign Famine Relief Association at No. 505 Henan Road, has been in charge of the association's affairs for sixteen years. He has been diligent and careful in his work and has achieved remarkable results. He has a special research on cooperative undertakings. The Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in order to extend and promote cooperation, consulted the association last November to borrow Mr. Zhang as the Director of the Cooperation Department. Initially, the term was three months. Later, because he was relied on to preside over planning, he repeatedly consulted to extend the loan in order to achieve success. Mr. Zhang felt that he was overworked because he held concurrent important positions. As the government is advocating cooperation at this time and relying on him so much, he could not easily shirk his responsibility midway. Therefore, he resigned from his position as General Secretary of the association in order to concentrate on departmental affairs. After careful discussion by the Executive Committee, it was agreed that the association valued Mr. Zhang very much, but the Ministry of Industry's promotion of cooperation required special talents. In order to comply with the government's eagerness to seek talents and to protect Mr. Zhang's energy, it was appropriate to allow him to resign. However, the Beijing Office was just established and the progress of affairs still depended on planning. The handover of association affairs also required preparation, so he could not leave office until the end of October of this year. After consultation, Executive Committee Member Yuan Kejun will succeed him in the vacated position. It is heard that he has agreed and is currently on vacation in the United States. He plans to return to China in January next year to take office.</p>

<h3>Dashing Amusement Park Opens Ao Mountain Lantern Display</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, various amusement parks at sea are adding novel programs to decorate the festive season. For instance, the Dashing Amusement Park on Tibet Road sent specialists to Fujian a month ago to procure Ao Mountain Lanterns to please visitors. It is said that these lanterns are unique and valuable art pieces from southern Fujian. All the lantern figures, pavilions, towers, and flora and fauna are made of the most delicate five-colored silk, ingeniously lifelike and incredibly flexible. With mechanisms inside, they can rotate naturally, appearing vividly real. It is said that the lanterns opened by the park display the entirety of the Grand View Garden. All twelve of the Jinling Twelve Beauties and other important figures like Grandmother Jia and Granny Liu from "Dream of the Red Chamber" are present. Regarding the arrangement of pavilions and towers, places like Yihong Courtyard, Xiaoxiang Pavilion, and Longcui Nunnery are almost entirely replicated, leaving nothing out. Furthermore, around the Grand View Garden, nearly suburban landscapes, mountains, rivers, forests, and fields have been created, looking realistic. Moreover, an ancient emperor's hunting scene is depicted, with guards arrayed, horses circling, and bows drawn, vividly lifelike. Records show that Ao Mountain Lanterns were items of tribute for the inner court during the Qing Dynasty. Because of the money and manpower required for their production, they were beyond the means of ordinary wealthy families, so opportunities to see them were rare. The park has signed a contract with the Fujian Sanshan Jincheng Lantern Architecture Company, investing 7,000 yuan, and starting from the fourteenth day of this lunar month, all the newly made, precious lanterns will be displayed on the eighth floor of the park.</p>
<h3>Grand World's Mid-Autumn Decorations</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization last month, Rongji's Grand World has, from its opening until now, been reformed by owner Huang Jinrong and managers Cai and Zhu in terms of securities transactions and altered entertainment. As a result, business is thriving as never before. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the park has specially commissioned many scenic artists, spending a considerable sum of money, to work day and night to create a Tang Dynasty "Moon Palace" moving lantern display and a large "dipper" frame over ten zhang tall. The dragon gate flags are bright and dazzling, large enough for visitors to walk through, showing how large it is. As for the Moon Palace lanterns, the figures and palaces are vividly lifelike. The park has also consulted with Taikang Biscuit Company to display a giant mooncake weighing over a hundred pounds, scheduled to be completed by the thirteenth day of the lunar calendar, for tourists to admire. From the same day until the seventeenth, each ticket will be given a box of Taikang Biscuit Company's exquisite mooncakes, with 50,000 boxes available. In addition to the park's buy-one-get-one-free ticket promotion, an additional 50,000 mooncakes will be given away. At that time, the number of guests will surely be like mountains and seas of people, with not a drop of water able to seep through.</p>
<h3>New Drugs for Treatment: Atebrin and Plasmoguine</h3>
<p>Malaria eradication work is extremely difficult to achieve, as sewage is everywhere and the public's knowledge is largely limited. Therefore, fundamentally eradicating malaria mosquitoes and larvae is no easy task. Although the Bureau of Health is working hard on the issue of malaria eradication, it is difficult to simultaneously address the treatment aspect due to various reasons. Eradicating malaria cannot rely solely on mosquito control, as the number of mosquitoes cannot be completely eliminated by human efforts alone. It must be understood that all chronic malaria patients, if not cured, are a source of renewed malaria spread. Therefore, if a person with malaria is not cured, mosquitoes will have the opportunity to transmit the disease from that person to others. There is a clear example of this. When the Panama Canal was being dug, malaria was rampant. Initial attempts at various mosquito control methods were ineffective. Later, when all malaria patients were moved out of the infected area, the trend gradually declined. This is because the mosquitoes lost their source of malaria and could no longer spread the disease. In the past, quinine was considered a magic cure for treating malaria, but it could only treat the symptoms and not eradicate the malaria parasites in the body. Recently, there has been a misconception that malaria parasites hidden in the body can increase immunity, which is a misunderstanding of medical principles. If malaria is not cured, it is detrimental to the patient's health. Recently, British and German experts have invented two new drugs: Atebrin and Plasmoguine. These drugs have no side effects. Atebrin is particularly pure. Compared to quinine, the former has no side effects, and the course of treatment is very short, only five days. Plasmoguine has been used to treat malaria in the past, but it required large doses to be effective. Today, the properties of this drug are fully understood, and it can be used to kill Gametin (sexually reproductive larvae) with a very small dose (greatly reduced from before), which has a great effect, so there are no harmful effects. In severe cases, injection is even more effective.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item "Haily Steamer Carries Strange Cargo" in today's local news section of your newspaper. The report is entirely false. Mr. Liu Kechun, manager of the Shantou business, traveled to Shanghai on the Haily steamer on the 20th. Xieji Sugar Factory in Shanghai entrusted him with four baskets of mud used to make local sugar. When landing, he forgot to take them with him. The captain of the Haily steamer did not investigate and jumped to conclusions, mistaking them for ammunition. It is truly absurd. In addition to proving the misunderstanding to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and retrieving the four baskets of sugar, I am writing to request that your newspaper investigate and correct the report and publish this letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Tong An Company, for the editors of Shen Bao.</p>

<p>I am writing to you because your newspaper published on September 24 my resume as a member of the Brain Workers Advancement Association, for which I am extremely grateful. However, there is an error in the resume. The title "President of Tongde College" should be "Graduate of Tongde College." Please correct this. I would be most grateful.

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the report in your newspaper on September 25 about the corpse case at the Hongpin Women's Hospital, which stated that Zhang Wenhua had studied at McTyeire School.

Initially, overseas silver markets were flat in both London and New York. It was said that after the market closed, the major players had not satisfied their buying orders at the listed prices, while sellers remained inactive. Speculation suggested that Mondelez's forward silver price would either remain unchanged or rise by seven points. Exchange rates generally declined. London spot gold rose by half a penny.

Although there were rumors of a further decline, buyers flocked in at $5.78, leading to stability. In the afternoon market, prices opened steadily due to strong buyer demand and gradually rose, turning the market bullish. Reports of long positions by Indian silver speculators in Anna and others led to short-selling at high prices and a pullback.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Showed Slight Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded October futures for one month. The market situation was relatively stable. Although an incident occurred in Shanghai, fortunately, there were no new developments. November futures were added today, and price fluctuations will continue to be influenced by the current situation. Yesterday's market opened with a weak sentiment, and sales of November bonds caused prices to fall by about 3-4 cents. In the subsequent trading, the market recovered slightly by 1-3 cents due to the absence of new developments. The afternoon opening saw continued selling pressure, causing prices to fall again by 0.05-0.15 cents. The closing was very stable, with Type D bonds falling by a slight 0.1 cents, Type B bonds rising by 0.1 cents, and the rest remaining unchanged. As a result, the market price only declined slightly by 0.05-0.3 cents. There were no price changes for Type A and Type B bonds. Although the market was relatively balanced, it had not yet emerged from the dangerous zone. The total trading volume yesterday was 6,725,000 yuan.

<h3>Yarn, Fabrics Sales Active, Yarn Market Sentiment High, Market Continues to Advance, Reaching Recent New Highs</h3>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening, and the surge in prices has been sudden. This is due to the improvement in yarn sales in recent days, coupled with active fabric trading. As a result, market sentiment is high, short positions are covered, and long positions are added. Both sides are driving the market forward, and the market price is advancing step by step, with the price of standard yarn reaching its highest point since the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises by Over 2 Yuan: In the morning opening of the standard yarn market, overseas yarn and cotton markets were normal, with recent deliveries being weak and far-term deliveries being more expensive. It was reported that yarn sales remained strong, and short positions were actively covered. The market suddenly tightened, rising by 1.3 yuan. The closing continued to advance, driven by aggressive short covering. Mingde and Xiecheng sold a large amount, while Genfeng, Hengyi, Zhenda, Senkang, Wangtaixing, and others purchased heavily. As a result, the prices of standard yarn for all months increased by between 2.00, 2.30, and 2.60 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a strong market sentiment. Purchases by those outside the industry were triggered by continuous yarn sales, resulting in a dry market and rising prices at every point. As a result, the prices for all months rose again by between 0.80, 0.90, and 1.10 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The recorded sales were: Yuda 7,100 bales, Yukang 2,150 bales, Tongji 1,550 bales, Dafu 1,100 bales, Mingde 4,450 bales, Shenji 4,200 bales, Xiecheng 1,000 bales, Shengyuan 1,850 bales, Kuaiji 4,200 bales, Xiecheng 1,000 bales, Shengyuan 1,850 bales, Ruidong 2,100 bales, Taichang 1,200 bales, Yichang 1,100 bales.

<h3>Although Buying Sentiment is Weak, Cotton Ultimately Drives the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite firm due to brisk yarn sales and naturally strong factory demand.  Prices from various producing areas have not loosened, and sources have not been eager.  Currently, short sellers are using old, coarse cotton to put pressure on the market, and as new cotton comes to market, buyers are not as numerous as in the cotton yarn market.  Moreover, some are buying yarn and selling cotton, engaging in arbitrage.</p>
<h3>Marked Cotton Rises Five to Six Jiao</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, American cotton remained flat and weak, falling three to five pounds. Indian cotton fell two rupees. Osaka Three-Grade Cotton rose one or two jiao. Market sentiment was relatively tight because the yarn market was advancing, factories were purchasing raw materials enthusiastically, prices in producing areas were not loose, and foreign merchants were also buying. The market steadily rose. It was found that Gengfeng and Dachang were dumping heavily, with Gengfeng selling cotton and buying yarn. Dafeng Yuanji also followed suit. However, Juxing, Fukang, Changhe, Changming, Huaming, and Hengyi brought in batches of cotton. As a result, prices for all months rose by three to four and a half jiao compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, near-month contracts showed strong momentum, and mainland merchants came to buy. The healthy yarn market has brought prosperity to the cotton market, which is closely linked to it. As a result, prices for all months rose compared to the morning closing. Mingde traded 1,400 dan, Meiji 6,300 dan, Dafeng 3,400 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, Jinchang 4,100 dan, Gengfeng 14,000 dan, Shenchang 6,200 dan, Shenji 7,600 dan, Taichang 4,600 dan, Xincheng 2,400 dan.

<h3>Near-Month American Cotton Still Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of American cotton trading, contracts for all months ranged from unchanged to down two pounds. The market situation in the early morning was sluggish. All transactions were mostly liquidating long positions in October contracts and shifting them to deferred months. Subsequently, buying by fellow traders and the Liverpool group reduced clearing balances, and market prices rebounded. New participants were lacking because Friday was the first day for issuing delivery notices for October contracts. Spot activity was needed, and spot prices were firm and high. The cloth market was relatively quiet. Near closing, short selling increased, mostly cooperative transactions, and market prices fell again. Near-month contracts were still firm due to buying by fellow traders. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices ranged from unchanged to down six pounds. British spot cotton fell six points, and futures fell two to three points. Old long positions in Indian cotton were liquidated, and short covering of Oomras was absorbed by professional buying. Flat Gujrat fell 1.25 rupees, Oomras fell two rupees, and Broach fell 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (Telegram of the 24th).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Increased Costs Make Cotton Cloth More Profitable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, marked yarn prices suddenly surged, and spot yarn became increasingly profitable. Various weaving factories saw strong demand for cotton cloth. Shortages of yarn have made spot goods increasingly firm and expensive. The sudden increase in the cost of cotton cloth is also generally seen as favorable. White goods merchants are aggressively raising the price of fine cloth and fine twill, by five cents to one dime per piece. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth from local factories have also risen by about one dime, and they are all struggling to supply enough goods. Yesterday, dyeing factories in the city purchased more than 300 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of Japanese origin. Merchants from this street, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Hankou purchased more than 400 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill from factories such as Yih Ho, Da Sheng, Zhen Tai, and Shen Zha. Factories have raised the prices of printed goods, minimum grade gabardine, line tweed, and other goods particularly sharply, by about one or two dimes. However, most factories still need time to deliver on existing orders and are urgently seeking to reduce orders. They are unwilling to accept high-priced spot transactions. The market is exceptionally firm and expensive, and demand from all quarters is particularly keen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Felt Boot Cloth Demand has Started</h3>
<p>The current sales of felt boot cloth are quite brisk, and market prices are firm. Since the Chongqing-Chengdu merchant groups have been actively purchasing, the inventory in Shanghai has decreased. New goods arriving in Shanghai are very scarce, and costs also need to be increased by about 10%. Currently, merchants from Tianjin are also showing great interest in purchasing. Shoe stores on this street with relatively ample funds are also preparing to purchase. However, the stock of goods is lacking, and there are many incomplete patterns and colors, causing buyers considerable disappointment.</p>
<h3>Food: Short Squeeze This Month, Flour Prices Rise Consistently in Near and Deferred Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the opening of the flour market, prices for all months rose. This was because quotations for foreign wheat were up 8.0 cents near-month and 4-5 cents deferred-month in Chicago, and about 5 cents in Canada. At the opening, because this month's contracts were nearing settlement, with the exchange setting the 26th as the final date, general short sellers and some small factories rushed to cover their positions, causing the market to steadily rise. For deferred months, outside speculators also began to absorb contracts, causing the market atmosphere to gradually tighten, up 2-3 cents from the previous day. At the afternoon opening, this month's contracts rose by 2 cents at the start, and afterwards, few sellers emerged. Short sellers scrambled to cover, leading to a short squeeze, and prices finally rose to 3.2625 yuan. Deferred-month contracts remained strong because of the tightness in near-month contracts, even though factories modestly sold short. As a result, prices rose by 4-6 cents across the board. These prices were recent record highs. Looking ahead, market sentiment this month may lead to further turbulence, it is feared.</p>

<h3>Wheat Prices Also Rise Sharply, This Month Rising to Just Over 5.03 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the opening of the wheat market, prices for all months showed signs of being level with rising prices. This was because quotations for foreign wheat were still up 4-8 cents. Thus, at the opening, market sentiment was still flat because this month's contracts were nearing settlement, and factories did not welcome deliveries from customers. However, for deferred months, the market was strong, initially because foreign wheat continued to rise, and also because of the good flour futures market. Although trading was not brisk, market prices were strong. At the afternoon opening, the continuous rise in flour prices attracted attention, and near- and deferred-month contracts rose another 2-3 cents. The final closing price for this month rose to 5.03 yuan, a recent new record. Spot wheat prices also continued to be firm. Shandong wheat was at 5.20 yuan, Yanghe wheat 5.14 yuan, lower-grade wheat 5.11 yuan, Shaheji wheat 5.15 yuan, lower-grade wheat 5.12 yuan, Yaowan Bengbu wheat 5.09 yuan, Zhangbaling wheat 5.12 yuan, Nanjing wheat 4.88 yuan, Hankou wheat 4.86 yuan, lower-grade wheat 4.875 yuan, Suzhou wheat 5.04 yuan, Hunan wheat 4.84 yuan, Wuhu wheat 4.86 yuan. Fuxin took 10,000 bags, and Shenda took 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Market for Newly Harvested Indica Rice is Quite Good</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various merchants were relatively scarce, totaling nearly 20 shipments, with nearly 4,000 shi of rice. Sales on this street were slightly more active, but only about 400 bags of Qingdao rice were purchased, so the market remained relatively stable. The行情 [háng qíng] for thick Shanghai rice was unchanged, and newly harvested glutinous rice and Baige rice also held steady. Because supplies of fresh sharp rice from Luyang and other areas were relatively scarce, sales were passable, and prices have rebounded by a few cents to nearly one dime. However, the market for medium-grade rice was still mediocre. Old degraded rice was ordinary, while the performance of the new Yin Indica rice was quite good.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 28-29 ships arrived from various river ports, and trading of various types was quite good on the market. Thin Indica rice was lackluster, and the prices for broken glutinous rice and high-quality glutinous rice were stable, while the prices for medium and lower grades were tight. Merchants in the 瓣埠 [bàn bù] district were showing some tightness in pointed rice of several cents. The price of degraded rice added about one or two dimes. The prices of West and East newly harvested glutinous rice moved slightly about a dime. Thin Indica rice was weak, and the prices of newly harvested Yangtuan and Dujian rice were not affected by the Xian price in any particular way.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Continue to Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Recently, due to strong purchasing interest from all parties, the market for black melon seeds has continued to tighten. Yesterday, Ji Kui seeds opened at 24 yuan, Xu Kui seeds at 20.5 yuan, and Zhongmu seeds at 18.5 yuan, up one yuan to several dimes. Prices at the producing areas are also gradually firming and there is currently a lack of price drops.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Rises Another Two Dimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended steadily. The association set the price for 24 coarse-grained white sugar at 21.5 yuan for spot goods and 6.55 yuan for transshipment goods. The price for Dongbai spot goods No. 4 was 21.3 yuan, and No. 8 was 21.1 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. No. 9 YRO mark was 20.9 yuan. The price for transshipment goods No. 4 was 6.4 yuan, No. 8 was 6.2 yuan, and No. 9 (SH) mark was 6.15 yuan. Prices for native cotton white sugar brands such as Zhenji, Jinxin, and Dahua No. 1 were unchanged. The market saw merchants from Chaozhou offering more than 600 bags of Hainan red sugar at 14.4 yuan, up 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint company held its fourth weekly auction of Guangdong accumulated sugar yesterday. The total amount set was more than 7,000 bags, at 11.4 yuan. Quxi Factory also offered 125 bags at 21 yuan. The municipal new factory also offered 100 bags at 21.2 yuan, and 50 bags of medium-grained white sugar at 19.3 yuan. A total of 920 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Rises Continuously, but Yesterday Prices Began to Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets showed mixed gains and losses. Raw silk trading on the New York Stock Exchange was again lackluster. Near-term contracts were up 1.5 cents from the previous period, while deferred contracts were down 1 cent. Yokohama was down 5-10 yuan. The Lyons silk market remained sluggish. The Shanghai silk market seemed to have reached its peak and prices softened. The silk exchange remained quiet. Foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Wing On slightly increased purchases, and there were also sporadic purchases of Qilihui, Jing Shuanggong, and other silk varieties. The end-user silk market showed a slight increase in buying interest, and silk prices also softened. For example, Zebra grade silk, which previously held a price of 680 yuan, fell by about 5 yuan yesterday, with sell orders at 675 or 672.50 yuan. It is hoped that sales will be achieved at that price. The remaining ordinary B-grade silk generally fell by 3-5 yuan or 2.5 yuan. Yesterday, the total volume of domestic and foreign silk sales in the city was 106 bales.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea is in Short Supply and Prices Rise, Green Tea Sales Show Some Activity</h3>
<p>After British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Hsieh Ho absorbed large quantities of Qimen black tea in previous days, yesterday the China Tea Trading Corporation, Wang Yutai, Hsieh Ho, and other firms continued to purchase 1,800-1,900 boxes. Due to the shortage of goods, market prices rose by 5-6 yuan compared to the previous day. The market currently has only 700-800 boxes remaining. The entire sales plan can be said to be fully realized at this point. The green tea market has also shown some activity in the past two days. Hsieh Ho, Yi He, Tongfu, and other firms have all purchased Lulianzhuang Zhenmei and Needle tea. However, because import prices from Morocco are tight, market prices still show no sign of rising.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Association, the tea market has been more active recently. In particular, Ping-Shui eyebrow tea sales have been quite brisk since the market price was equalized. It is reported that Jardine Matheson, Hsieh Ho, China Tea, and Yih Ho all made substantial purchases, with high-grade teas selling for 22-25 yuan, medium-grade teas selling for 15-17 yuan, and lower-grade teas selling for 13-14 yuan, totaling more than 5,700 boxes. In addition, Yih Ho purchased 1,500 boxes of green Tong shrimp eye tea at a price of 53 yuan. Tongfu purchased 500 small boxes of Dagang tea, mainly from Yih Ho, with most of them being Embroidery eyebrow tea priced at approximately 15-16 yuan. Other companies such as Zhen Xie He Tianxiang also traded a few dozen to a hundred boxes each, and Zhen Mei Yi He Baolong also had their own respective purchase agents. It is observed that the prices of all teas sold were stable.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Prime Virgin Lead Prices Rise Sharply, Overseas Demand Increases Significantly, Affecting the Local Market</h3>
<p>Prime virgin lead trading has been quiet for a long time because prices were too high, and most buyers switched to purchasing native lead and recycled lead, with little interest in foreign lead. However, since yesterday and the day before, market trends have changed dramatically. Overseas news indicates that due to the Spanish war, lead is an essential item for manufacturing military equipment, so all countries are competing to buy it, and the market price has soared by one pound, with each ton selling for eighteen pounds, with few spot goods available. Local firms, upon receiving this news, are hoarding goods. The market has a shortage of supply and strong demand, and prices have jumped 1.5 yuan, with each dan selling for 25 yuan. Native lead is also selling for 23 yuan, and recycled lead is 21-22 yuan, with prices firm across the board. 200-300 pieces were traded, with most of the sales being made to merchants from the Rong district. Local families have only inquired and have not yet placed orders.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: New Tung Oil Production Period is Approaching</h3>
<p>Since the sharp drop in tung oil prices, markets in various places have become depressed. Although 洋荘 [yáng zhuāng] (foreign firms) in Hankou have sporadic transactions, there are no large transactions, resulting in very little market vitality and stagnant inventories. As the saying goes, "Expensive goods remain unsold." However, with 洋荘 [yáng zhuāng] (foreign firms) wanting to purchase spot goods, 行家 [háng jiā] (industry experts) are not willing to sell them cheaply, so transactions still require a foreign standard price of 53-54 yuan per dan. It is heard that new oil has been offered for sale from November to January of the new year, with prices ranging from 47 yuan to 48 yuan, and several hundred tons have been traded. Later, the price will need to be 50 yuan. For 洋行 [yáng háng] (foreign firms), they have a stronger interest in 期油 [qí yóu] (futures oil) and are focusing on futures. The few spot goods they take are priced casually and taken at will, so all merchants do not pay much attention to the spot oil market in Hankou, mainly to observe the overall market situation. In Zhejiang, new production starts earlier, and new goods are expected to arrive in Shanghai in late October. Therefore, merchants from Hangzhou have been offering 3,000-4,000 砠 [zhǔ] of oil in Shanghai every day, with the highest price being 46 yuan per 砠 [zhǔ] (a small number), but the vast majority were at the lowest price of 40 yuan. It is heard that spot goods still need 52-53 yuan delivered to Shanghai. However, this year, local tung oil firms in Shanghai have jointly agreed to refuse the practice of 洋貨 [yáng huò] (foreign goods) before 本貨 [běn huò] (domestic goods), so all transactions are for 洋貨 [yáng huò] (foreign goods) and 本貨 [běn huò] (domestic goods) to be delivered simultaneously. This is also because in previous years, merchants suffered losses from selling goods before delivering them, as they had delivery deadlines, and if the seller defaulted, they would have to make separate arrangements to deliver and bear the losses. Therefore, there is a joint effort to ban this practice. Furthermore, the 洋鐵箱 [yáng tiě xiāng] (foreign iron boxes) used to store tung oil have also been uniformly changed to standard boxes, so the long-standing problem of heavy boxes has been eliminated, the box issue has been clarified, and the tung oil industry will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>Statistics: The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank Releases Production Index for June</h3>
<p>The production index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, previously published in major daily newspapers and the Bank's monthly report prior to May of this year, is now known to have been calculated for June as 105.7, higher than any other month this year, which is a good sign for the future of the industry.

<h3>How to Be a Female Office Worker</h3>
<p>— Mei Ting</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of women working in society has gradually increased. However, at the same time, disreputable titles and embarrassing [situations] have become increasingly common. On the one hand, this is due to society's underestimation of women and the habit of making a fuss about minor things. On the other hand, it is brought about by the women themselves who work in society. I believe that a woman squeezing into today's society—a male-centered society—and snatching a rice bowl from their hands is not something to be proud of, but rather something to be regarded as simply lucky. We are the lucky ones who have gained a self-reliant position. How should we conduct ourselves? This is a personal question worth discussing.</p>
<p>The reason why female office workers are criticized by society is that there are certainly unsatisfactory aspects. Apart from the unavoidable disadvantage due to physiological reasons compared to men, I believe that since men and women are equal and receive the same salary, you should use your ability to do your duty and work equally with your colleagues. This is an absolute rule that female office workers should abide by. As for disreputable actions caused by other personnel matters within the scope of work, they should also be absolutely avoided. Then the nickname "vase" will naturally not be put on your heads.</p>
<p>At the same time, female office workers also have a very common bad habit, which is "arriving late and leaving early." Although this cannot be generalized, the fact tells us that in offices where attendance check-in is only considered a formality and is not strictly enforced, female office workers' late arrivals and early departures have become very common and ought to be conservative and thrifty (although there are exceptions where heavy makeup is necessary due to business reasons). If you want to win the favor of colleagues or the company's managers with your own beauty, it is tantamount to selling your own body, fundamentally losing the task and mission of the female office worker herself. This is the biggest reason why one is most easily looked down upon.</p>
<p>As for disreputable actions caused by other personnel matters within the scope of work, they should also be absolutely avoided. There are certainly many so-called other personnel matters, such as colleagues falling in love, etc., which are sufficient to affect personal reputation. Although love is something that cannot be abandoned in life, we should recognize that love is a kind of medicine to encourage one's career. We must not indulge in it or let love run wild, so as to destroy one's career. Other things, like using bad methods to entice male colleagues to substitute for one's own work and not going to the office, are the worst kind of common behavior, and should also be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Life of Joan of Arc, the French Heroine</h3>
<p>— Ms. Cao Yi</p>
<p>The most famous woman in France that everyone knows is Madame Roland, but they forget about a woman who sacrificed herself to save her country in the fifteenth century, and that woman was Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>Arc was the daughter of a village farmer. As a child, after school, she would help her father work in the fields; at night, she would sit by her mother's side spinning cotton until late. There was a small grove of trees by her house, where the neighborhood children often gathered to jump, play, and sing, and Arc sometimes joined them. Even the birds and beasts in the woods were her good friends; the little sparrows were not afraid of her and always came to perch on her shoulders. It is said that she could even summon wild animals to play. In worldly terms, she was an innocent and carefree village girl. She loved listening to the bells of the church and also liked to serve the sick in her village.</p>
<p>In 1429, she was already eighteen years old. At that time, King Charles of France was under attack by the English, and the French troops were retreating day by day, while the English army was advancing inch by inch, and the whole country was terrified! In this critical moment, Arc was lying in bed one day when she suddenly saw a divine being appear to her, ordering her to go see the French king and restore the authority of France. She said, "I am just a farmer's daughter and do not know how to lead troops into battle." The divine being said, "God will help you." Arc then went to see King Charles and said, "God has commanded me to tell you that you will surely restore your authority and become God's general, ruling France." The king cheered and said, "God has sent you! Please lead my army to kill the enemy!" Arc led the troops onto the battlefield, wearing snow-white armor, holding a French lily in her hand, and was extremely brave. She was very tall and rode a horse like a man; she did not eat anything all day on horseback and did not feel tired. She led tens of thousands of soldiers as a mother leads a child. When she arrived at the battlefield, she waved her hand and shouted loudly, "Kill the enemy! Do not be afraid!" When the soldiers heard these words, their courage increased instantly, and they charged forward, defeating the enemy greatly. The enemy retreated into the fortress, and Arc led the soldiers to attack the fortress. Suddenly, she was injured and fell to the ground, and the soldiers lost their morale and prepared to retreat. Arc suddenly got up! Shouting, "Wait! Rest for a while! If you see my flag touching the enemy's wall, then attack bravely!" As a result, they won a great victory. After reaching the castle, she ran to the church to thank God.</p>
<p>After the war was over, her great task was accomplished. Arc asked the king to let her go home, but the king refused. At this time, the English, having been defeated greatly, were determined to seek revenge. Arc continued to fight bravely, but unfortunately, she was captured by a villain named Bastar. He sold her to the English, who regarded her as a sorceress and locked her in prison for a whole year. Later, they falsely accused her of being a witch and sentenced her to death. Then, they brought her to the middle of the street, tied her with a thick rope, and piled firewood underneath. Arc calmly raised her head to the sky and cried out loudly, "English! English! I am afraid that in the future you will suffer endless pain because of my death!" Before the cry had ended, a fierce fire blazed up.</p>
<p>Ms. Arc died! She sacrificed herself for the country! She awakened the hot blood of all the French people! She restored the land of France!</p>
<p>The current situation in China is probably more dangerous than France in the fifteenth century, but the women of China have completely forgotten the spirit of courage of Ms. Arc and are still living their comfortable lives in a drunken stupor. My dear sisters! Our end is near! Wake up! Follow the spirit of Ms. Arc and save our endangered country!</p>

<h3>Impressionistic Notes on the Three Heroines of Lingnan, Xiong Bishuang, Yaoshuang, and Peishuang, Sisters of Shining Talents and Paired Pendants</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>Science can save the country, and art can also save the country; since we are Chinese, we should serve China!</p>
<p>The three Lingnan Xiong sisters, Bishuang, Yaoshuang, and Peishuang, are renowned in the art world. Fortunately, they have been praised by important figures in the party and government, which has increased their reputation tenfold. Originally, in the current stage, no matter what academic expert you are, you will not be able to increase your status by relying on your own strength. Unless you have the support of prominent figures, you will never be able to show your face. Art is originally the noblest and most detached thing. I wonder how many artists nowadays have become famous by their own skills? How many are not specially promoted by distinguished and powerful figures? In other words, artistic achievement must have considerable skill to enjoy considerable fame. This is as it should be. We naturally dare not compliment those who have mediocre skills but possess false reputations. Like the two Lingnan heroines, who went to Beijing last year at the behest of Mr. Wang Jingwei to exhibit their works, I think those who have not seen them will inevitably have doubts about their art. This is human nature and not surprising. The day before yesterday, the three sisters came to Shanghai together. Driven by curiosity, I went to visit them. First, I viewed their works, including flowers, birds, figures, individual and collaborative pieces. After appreciating more than a dozen new works, I was convinced that their skills were profound and extraordinary. They truly captured the essence of Yun Shouping's style. With such young ages and such good achievements, it is no coincidence that they can gain the appreciation of important figures.</p>
<p>They are originally from Panyu. Their father was a Qing dynasty scholar and a student of Mr. Yu Quyuan. The Xiong family has five daughters and three sons. Bishuang is the second daughter. When she and her two younger sisters were studying at Zhixin Girls' School in Guangzhou, Wang Jingwei taught literature courses, and Sun Zhesheng and Zhu Jiahua were school board members, so they had a deep teacher-student relationship. Later, they entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Hong Kong and graduated together last summer. The three sisters initially learned Western painting and later switched to Chinese painting, under the guidance of Gao Qifeng, Rong Zhongsheng, and Zhang Zichu. Over the past ten years, their art has greatly improved. They went to the capital last year and held an exhibition. In May of this year, they held a pre-departure exhibition. In these few days, they will hold another pre-departure exhibition in Shanghai. The location and date will be determined by the municipal government. After the exhibition, they will return to Guangdong and set off overseas, first to Singapore and other major ports in Southeast Asia to exhibit their works, and then directly to Germany, followed by England and France. Next year, they will visit the United States, travel back to China via Japan, for a period of one year. This time, they are under the order of the Ministry of Education to investigate the art of European and American countries, and incidentally exhibit their works to promote Chinese art abroad, while also hoping to absorb more Western painting styles and techniques.</p>
<p>"After investigating Europe and America and returning to China, how will you work hard for your future?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Our plan is to return to Guangdong after returning to China to establish a women's art college to cultivate new talents. Currently, Guangzhou only has a municipal art vocational school, and there is no such school specifically for women in the country. Many people in the central government have expressed sympathy. This time, we will first make preliminary contacts with the provincial and municipal authorities in Guangdong. Besides this, there is no second plan."</p>
<p>"Do you three sisters have the same aspirations?"</p>
<p>Shuangtuo said, "Yes! The three of us have the same knowledge, the same interests, and the same goals, of course."</p>
<p>"In that case, you are truly three in one." So everyone laughed for a while.</p>
<p>"Just as you are going abroad, the national crisis is becoming increasingly tense. May I ask what you think about this?"</p>
<p>Peishuang said: "We are too young and only know how to paint a few strokes. How dare we talk about national affairs. However, art can represent the nation's characteristics. Science can save the country, and art can also save the country, but the methods are slightly different. Since the 'September 18th' Incident, we have also had many works that express patriotism, such as 'Wagtails in the Meadow', 'Birds Singing in Tall Trees', 'Geese Coming to Fruition'... all of which are lyrical works about the national crisis and have attracted everyone's attention."</p>
<p>"What opinions do you three sisters usually have on women's issues?"</p>
<p>All three of them had opinions on this issue. Later, Bishuang summarized them and said again: "Women account for at least half of the entire nation. Since we are all Chinese, we should equally shoulder the responsibility of saving China. How can we save the country? This cannot be summed up in a few words. As for the three of us, we can only start with ourselves, train our talents, and enrich our knowledge; standing in the position of art creators, we must take on the responsibility of saving the country in our respective positions. In addition to investigating art on this trip, we will pay attention to the strengths of women in various countries and bring them back for our female compatriots to refer to.</p>
<p>As we were talking, someone pushed open the door and entered the room, shook hands as a greeting, and said to the reporter: "...Although my daughters have lived in Hong Kong and Guangdong for a long time and traveled far to Beijing and Shanghai, and have graduated from university, they still have not been infected with the habits of the city and can maintain a loyal and sincere attitude, which is enough to comfort us. Now that they have returned to the prosperous city, they are originally ignorant and simply like country people visiting the City God Temple, and they all need the guidance of senior gentlemen. In addition to studying and painting, they do not ask about foreign affairs and do not understand socializing. This time abroad gives them the opportunity to know the new trends in Eastern and Western cultural undertakings..."</p>
<p>The three sisters of the same mind, sent to study abroad, traveling in Europe and America, investigating art, is indeed a glorious page in the history of the Chinese women's movement. However, the customs of Western countries are somewhat different from those of our country, such as the etiquette of social engagements, the healthy and lively nature, especially for women, should be paid attention to; the artistic works of the Xiong sisters have reached the top, but they still retain the gentle breath of ladies, and when they see people, they seem shy and timid, and their bodies seem thin. In the eyes of Westerners, they may misunderstand that Chinese women still have this sickly beauty.</p>
<h3>The Three Xiong Sisters and Their Signatures</h3>
<h3>Biographies of Famous Women in the World (5)</h3>
<p>— Lusha Bai</p>
<p>The most outstanding female politician in the Soviet Union today is Yelena Dmitriyevna Stasova. Since the decline of Kollontai and Krupskaya, and before Nikolayeva and Kaluykina emerged, she has been engaged in the revolutionary struggle for thirty-six years and is now the chairman of the International Relief Organization, with a high reputation internationally.</p>
<p>In the thirty-six years of struggle, from Lenin to Stalin, she occupied almost half of the party history of the Soviet Union. From the time of the founding of "Iskra" at the end of the nineteenth century, she often participated in all the secrets of the party. Among the veterans of the Soviet revolution, she can be considered one of the few.</p>
<h3>Stasov</h3>
<p>She looks like a typical female weaver, extremely serious and enthusiastic about her career. Work is her life. Unlike ordinary politicians who use public office for private gain, she has never been involved in political relations because of emotional factors. No matter what her political tendencies, she can always adapt to the trend and be loyal to her duties.</p>
<p>During the first revolutionary struggle, she was arrested at the Novgorod station and imprisoned in the Moscow Taganskaya Prison. During the second revolution, she was sentenced to exile and later escaped to St. Petersburg, where she organized the Central Party Department with Molotov and others, and invited Ilyich to preside over it. After the success of the revolution, she was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee at the Sixth Party Congress, and as a member of the Central Committee at the Seventh and Eighth Party Congresses. In 1920, she was appointed as a guide at the First Oriental National Congress held in Baku. In 1933, she served as a member of the purge committee during the party purge. She is currently the chairman of the International Relief Organization, and has been in office for six years, constantly fighting against the white terror around the world, enthusiastically helping oppressed people around the world. Last year, on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday, the entire Soviet Union warmly congratulated her.</p>
<h3>Women's Family Pastimes</h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>The Columbia Women's Club of Vancouver, Canada, has been established for more than ten years and has nearly four thousand members. The club not only has well-equipped clubhouses to provide members with the convenience of life, as well as physical and moral cultivation, but also focuses on the design of general women's family life. In the spring of this year, the club hired twelve experts who have long studied women's family life to engage in research suitable for general women's family life. The twelve experts include three Canadians, three Americans, four from the United Kingdom and other territories, one overseas Chinese student in the United States, and one French person. After four months of careful discussion and exchange of opinions, the following items were unanimously recognized as the most suitable family pastimes for women in their spare time or after taking care of household chores.</p>
<p>(1) Knitting with wool and cotton yarn, such as hats, shawls, coats, tablecloths, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Embroidery, such as all kinds of patterns on clothes, shoes and hats, as well as embroidery on curtains, sofa cushions, tablecloths, gloves, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Planting flowers. The vacant land in the garden next to the house can be used as a good place for planting flowers. Water and cultivate them every day so that when the flowers bloom, they can be used as altar offerings for the family.</p>
<p>(4) Arranging the furniture and sundries in the home to make it beautiful and clean.</p>
<p>(5) Raising domestic animals and poultry to increase the vitality of the family.</p>
<p>(6) Promoting indoor sports, such as flexibility exercises and table tennis, so that every woman has a certain amount of exercise every day, which can not only improve health, but also regulate the circulation of blood solution in the human body and make the appearance beautiful.</p>
<p>Regarding items (1) and (2), the club will further invite several knitting and embroidery experts to compile textbooks for a long time and draw all kinds of new design patterns, publish them in special books, or in the club's publications, and in several women's magazines in Canada and the United States, for general women to use. For items (3) and (5), the club will also hire several experts to write articles and introduce all kinds of flowers, grasses, trees, and trees suitable for foreign language families to plant, as well as poultry, fish, birds, and beasts suitable for family raising. Club members have the opportunity to obtain free written or face-to-face inquiries. It is expected that after one year, if the results are excellent, the eastern part of the club intends to expand and hire several family instructors to be used by members to invite to their homes for guidance. In addition to compiling and printing pamphlets to guide general women with the knowledge and principles of arrangement and tidiness, item (5) also plans to hire three or four experts to give periodic public lectures and provide consultations for members. For item (6), in addition to writing promotion, it also plans to compile and print wall charts, and shoot slides and moving films to promote to members. Regarding the above six items, the club provides all the tools, raw materials, and seeds, etc., except for a portion for members to purchase, and at the same time, it specially appoints several related stores to sell them to the club at a considerable value for convenience.</p>
<p>In addition to the above six items, the twelve research members have also designed several outdoor pastimes, such as (1) travel during holidays, (2) boating, (3) driving a car, (4) riding a bicycle, (5) photography..., etc. Because of the limited space and because women in our country have not yet reached a considerable level, they are omitted. —Regarding these outdoor activities, the club will also hire several responsible instructors to provide members with various conveniences.</p>
<p>Women in our country have no entertainment in their families. All spare time, or the remaining moments of handling housework, are almost completely consumed in a decadent life. On the one hand, it is said that it does not allow the cultivation of temperament and virtue, and on the other hand, it cannot be said to be beneficial to health or seek interest. Women who live in this decadent life, in addition to developing a grumpy temper and a narrow self, which breaks the joy of the family, there is really no better result that can be produced. Therefore, here I especially introduce some experts' family life design plans to the readers. I hope that the women's world in our country will quickly jump out of the decadent life and pursue a rational family life.</p>
<h3>The Eldest Sister I Haven't Seen in Ten Years (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Shouzhen</p>
<p>When I returned home this summer vacation, I accidentally ran into Ping's eldest sister. If she hadn't recognized me and excitedly called out my nickname, her haggard face and her untimely dress almost made me completely unable to recognize who she was. How would I have thought that my eldest sister, who was so beautiful, delicate, and very neat, would change into this appearance in less than ten years!</p>
<p>When I saw that it was her, I ran to her immediately. She still grabbed my hand as enthusiastically as before and asked about my situation in the past few years. So I told her that after graduating from junior high school in this county, I went to Shanghai to attend high school, and then went on to university. Now I have graduated from university and am working. After listening to my words, she sighed with infinite emotion and said, "Oh, you children are all making progress. Ping is also in Shanghai now. You can go see her when you have time! Her life is not as good as yours. She often writes to complain about her loneliness and mental discomfort. Now she is the mother of two children. Although the life of a small family is still happy, she has no career or future of her own, so she is always very empty. You used to be such a good pair. Now you are going your separate ways." As she spoke, infinite repression was revealed in her two big eyes that had been praised by many people. Finally, she told me Ping's address in Shanghai and said that her child at home was sick, so she left hurriedly.</p>
<p>As her back disappeared from my eyes like autumn leaves, I suddenly felt lost!</p>
<p>It was only ten years ago, right? At that time, I was only thirteen years old and studying in a local junior high school. Ping and I were classmates in elementary school. We were not only the same age, but also had similar figures and personalities. People who didn't know us always thought we were sisters, and we had always been as close as sisters. At that time, Ping's eldest sister taught at the elementary school attached to our school. She not only had very good teaching methods and was very good at Chinese, but she also had a special talent for music and handicrafts. Moreover, she was young, beautiful, lively, and kind, so the local society recognized her as a typical new woman. In school, her long singing voice and gentle personality made every elementary school student surround her, and her unique kindness and generosity made even the workers in the school very grateful to her.</p>
<p>Every winter, Ping always wore her new wool sweater and new gloves, and ran to school happily, boasting about her eldest sister's love for her. And in the summer, her eldest sister would make her the most fashionable lapel short shirt at that time. The classmates were very envious of her, and my eldest sister would always send me a pair of gloves or a scarf every year, so I was also happier than other classmates.</p>
<p>However, old etiquette and social habits did not allow a girl who was over twenty years old to stay with her mother. Ping's eldest sister was already a girl over twenty years old, so her parents began to worry, because they could not find a good son-in-law for this perfect daughter, so they were worried. So they sent out news of choosing a son-in-law everywhere, and unmarried men everywhere wanted to court this good match. Finally, one morning, Ping ran to tell me with a face full of smiles that her parents had obtained the consent of her eldest sister and had engaged her.</p>
<p>That year's winter vacation, I returned to the countryside and waited until school started. When I met Ping, the first thing she said was that her eldest sister had already gotten married. And she had resigned from her teaching position at the attached elementary school and was preparing to go to Shanghai with her husband. From then on, I never saw my eldest sister again, and Ping rarely mentioned her news, until later Ping got married and we lost contact.</p>
<h3>Findings from Interviews with Professional Women: (2) Thoughts and Lives of Female Employees at the New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>— Xianying</p>
<p>There are further similarities, namely:</p>
<p>(1) They can all represent upright and noble women from middle-class families.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of knowledge, they all have the qualifications of a junior high school graduate or one year lower or higher who has received civic education.</p>
<p>(3) They have no bad habits, let alone vulgar and absurd behaviors. They are very responsible at work, very satisfied with their positions, and good citizens who can love and respect themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to the above six similarities, I would also like to write a special feature on individuals: Mary—a Chinese-Western mixed-style girl from Ningxin, with a short stature and full of energy. Compared to the tragic star Sylvia Sidney, she is not lying. She studied in a foreign school since she was a child, speaks impeccable English, and is lively and fluent in her answers.</p>
<p>Yuping—the most knowledgeable among her colleagues, having worked as a teacher and writing beautiful calligraphy. She likes sports and filled the role as the captain of the school basketball team, once she stood out. She is very naive, has a special posture when walking, and has an egg-shaped face and medium stature. She likes to learn to fly an airplane, and she told people that it was a pity that she didn't have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Peiyi—is a child, but the oldest in age. She likes to swim, her tongue is too short, her pronunciation is inaccurate, but she is very hardworking and is taking English lessons.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen—a female social activist, her compassionate heart is as developed as her fat body. She has lost money running a civilian night school, and is now also the director of nursing education. She wears cloth clothes and cloth shoes, and firmly believes in Christianity.</p>
<p>Xiuqin—is the youngest, but very capable. She can drive an elevator and also be a chef. She can speak Suzhou dialect and Shanghai dialect. In particular, her ability to be thrifty is even more outstanding. It is said that she is reluctant to spend two dimes on a movie.</p>
<p>According to all their similarities, they can very well represent the majority of modern professional women—middle class, average knowledge, twenty-something, forty or fifty yuan a month. Therefore, I believe that my interviews with only five of them can very well tell the various aspects of the lives and thoughts of professional women. Below, I list seven major questions and let's see the answers they gave me.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding career:</p>
<p>A. What is the purpose of accepting your current job, A- interest, B- money, C- social service, D- life is too idle. The answer is three said for money, two said for social service.</p>
<p>B. Ideal job and salary, and whether you participate in other social movements besides your current job? The answer is:</p>
<p>Desired Occupation Salary Participated in Other Social Movements?</p>
<p>Mary Present job 50 yuan</p>
<p>Yuping Laborer 50 yuan</p>
<p>Peiyi The more the better</p>
<p>Xiuzhen Teacher 50 yuan YMCA volunteer school</p>
<p>Xiuqin Secretary 40-50 yuan</p>

<p>Blood in Semen</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Number 30, Mr. Chen Rongquan of No. 81, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road asks: I was enticed by bad friends to visit a prostitute once, resulting in profuse white discharge and extreme pain. After reading in the newspaper about "Nemesis of Syphilis" treating gonorrhea, I bought and took it, and the discharge did indeed seem to be completely cured! Recently, I accidentally read some lewd books and performed self-stimulation, resulting in blood mixed in the semen, with a reddish-brown color. There are no other symptoms. (1) What disease is this? (2) What treatment method should I use and what medicines should I take? (3) Will this be harmful to my body in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It is "seminal vesiculitis." (2) Massage, cold water baths, and injections of "Guoneng Kelin" (Sino-Acrindin) and "Xinya Calcium" (Sinocalcin). Other than cold water baths, these require a doctor to administer. (3) It will cause problems with fertility.</p>
<p>Swollen Legs</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Number 21, Mr. Xia Anzhi asks: I am 18 years old. I quit school to go into business at the age of sixteen, so I lack exercise and receive little sunlight. My development is otherwise complete, and my body is quite tall. At the end of the year before last, while washing my feet, I noticed slight swelling in the depressions of my ankles, but I didn't pay attention to it. Last spring, I suddenly felt even more swelling, so I bought five boxes of foot swelling pills from the OOO Pharmacy in Dainanmen, but they had no effect. Then I went to a Chinese medicine doctor, OOO, for injections, but this also failed to remove the swelling. I heard it was caused by kidney deficiency, and that eating turtles could reduce swelling, so I ate four or five of them, but there was no change. This spring, I read in a book that it was caused by a lack of "Vitamin B," so I bought rice bran from the grain store and ate it, which seemed to reduce the swelling quite a bit. Now, I would like to ask: (1) What is the actual cause of this disease? (2) What kind of medicine can completely remove it? (3) Please indicate which methods of health maintenance are necessary, indicating surgery(?). (4) I have a lot of phlegm; what medicine can I take to remove this?</p>
<p>(1) Two diseases can cause these symptoms: beriberi and cardiac edema. What you have can only be determined after an examination. The cause of beriberi is a lack of "Vitamin B1," along with bacterial infection. (2) Please have a doctor inject "Tui E Shui" (Theosal), which can completely eliminate the swelling, but if it is beriberi, it is essential to also take "Vitamin B" (Vitamin-B). (3) Walk less, rest more, and do not eat rice, but instead focus on eating noodles and vegetables. Since eating bran is effective, you might as well continue to eat it. (4) Take "Baikeding" (Pacdin) tablets, three times a day, two tablets each time.</p>
<p>Blood in Phlegm</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Number 32, Mr. Huang Shixi of No. 13, Xiushui Beach, Xiaonanmen Wai, Nanshi asks: I am twenty-one years old this year. In mid-May of last year, I suddenly had a small amount of red blood in my phlegm, but it has not happened since. I often feel dizzy and weak. In June, my throat suddenly became hoarse, and my voice is now completely gone, with all medicines proving ineffective. In September, after an X-ray, I finally learned that I have lung disease. May I ask: (1) Is the loss of voice related to lung disease? If so, what is the reason? (2) Is there any hope of regaining my voice? (3) What is the appropriate treatment, and what medicines should I take regularly?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The loss of voice is due to laryngeal tuberculosis. The medical term for lung pain is "pulmonary tuberculosis." The close relationship between the two is self-evident. (2) It is difficult to expect a full recovery without proper treatment. (3) Drug therapy: injections of "Gaigushen" (Calchosen), oral "Xinya Calcium" (Sinocalcin) tablets, and "Yuya Calcium." Nutritional therapy: eat what you like. Sunlight therapy: bask your chest in the morning sunlight for twenty minutes each day. Pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Lead Poisoning Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Number 33, Mr. Cheng Yinrui of Minsheng Printing House, Avenue Edward VII asks: I am twenty-three years old. I have been working at this printing house as a typesetter for four years. Less than half a year after starting, I began to have frequent stomach pains, as sharp and stabbing as if something was being twisted inside. It feels like there is a hard lump below my navel. When the pain strikes, I feel dizzy, my face turns as white as paper, and beads of sweat roll down my body like raindrops. Therefore, I ask (1) What is this disease? (2) Can the doctor cure it? (3) What is the treatment? (4) Is it appendicitis?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) "Chronic lead poisoning," also known as "lead colic." This is because you unknowingly inhaled lead dust, which accumulated over time and is now causing trouble in your body. Typesetters are prone to this disease. (2) You don't necessarily need to consult me. Any qualified modern doctor can treat this disease with great confidence. (3) An injection of 5% "calcium chloride" can immediately relieve the pain, and a few injections can cure it completely. (4) No.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Problem of Reducing the Number of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Rickshaws are truly having a very unlucky time these days. Not long ago, to restrict the increase in the number of public rickshaws and limit the number of rickshaw registration quotas, one disaster after another fell upon their heads, making it impossible for them to maintain even the most basic living despite their blood and sweat. Now, their unprecedented crisis has arrived: the suggestion by the Concession authorities to reduce the number of rickshaws. This problem quickly spread, and even the rickshaw owners felt threatened and uneasy.</p>
<p>Originally, under the so-called wave of economic recession, layoffs and salary reductions are very common. Therefore, some people think that reducing the number of rickshaws is just another form of cutting back in the rickshaw industry, and they treat it as something very ordinary. We believe that this view of the problem is inappropriate. Without even mentioning whether it has anything in common with layoffs and salary reductions, the starting point for reducing the number of rickshaws is that people in modern civilization feel that rickshaws are backward and "inhumane." This principle of abolishing rickshaws makes us feel that it cannot be equated with the former. This is "elimination," not simply due to the economic downturn in the rickshaw industry.</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss the question of whether this "elimination" is an appropriate method. Of course, in this era of the 20th century with its highly developed mechanical industry, it is not surprising to advocate the elimination of this "inhumane," old system of one person driving another. However, if we simply feel that it is "unacceptable" and then try to completely eliminate rickshaws by starting with "reduction" and "restriction," this is not very appropriate. In the past, during rickshaw-related disputes, such as the dispute over restricting registration, such as preparing rickshaw coolie benefit associations, etc., I have said that if we want to completely resolve the rickshaw pullers' problems, we should start by solving their livelihoods. Therefore, the "biggest reason" for the several rickshaw pullers' disturbances "is that the suffering of the rickshaw pullers themselves has not been noticed." Now, we have seen the news of the rickshaw pullers staging a major petition to the Municipal Council. The main points of their petition are nothing more than: (1) reorganize the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association; (2) abolish restrictions on rickshaw pullers' registration; (3) drop the proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws. From this, we see that although the current rickshaw pullers' problems can be considered to have come to an end for the time being, they have not been thoroughly resolved after all. The problems still exist and are still just as serious. The problem of reducing the number of rickshaws is simply a continuation of the previous problems, and this time even the interests of the rickshaw owners have been affected, making the problem even more complex.</p>
<p>Recently, we have not seen any results regarding this issue. However, we have a very small hope. That is to ask those who advocate for the complete abolition of rickshaws to pay some attention to what will happen to the livelihoods of the tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers who will be abolished. Of course, their current inhumane lives should be rescued, but the method of rescue is definitely not to abolish them and expect a good outcome. Abolishing rickshaws will undoubtedly cause them to lose their jobs. At that time, their lives will not even be comparable to "inhumane lives." Therefore, we very much hope that this time the problem of reducing the number of rickshaws will have a very thorough solution.</p>
<h3>Talking About Tour Guides</h3>
<p>— Shih Huaizi</p>
<p>In American movies, there are quite a few films that feature tour guides as the main characters (I remember "The Moon and Sixpence"). The ending is always the same as in general American romance movies: the male tour guide gets a beautiful and affectionate (sometimes even wealthy) wife. In China, the situation seems somewhat different. Although tour guide agencies are now booming, there are no male tour guides – or perhaps there are? But I have never seen them in advertisements. Even if there were, I don't think anyone would hire them. As for female tour guides, those who hire them to "guide" are mostly foreign firm employees who have lived in Shanghai for a long time, small clerks in various organizations, and university students who ask them to "guide" things like how to eat steamed buns (see the confession of a female tour guide in the Da Wan Bao). It's as if these people have never eaten steamed buns in their lives.</p>
<p>At first, I didn't quite understand the reason for this. I just thought that the reason why the tour guide industry is so developed is probably because Shanghai is a major commercial port that is the focus of attention for both China and foreign countries. But after learning that so-called tour guides even have to guide people on how to eat steamed buns, I thought that the reason why the tour guide industry is so developed is that they also have to work as "nannies" in addition to "tour guides."</p>
<p>But this "assumption" that I thought was close to correct was broken by the classified ads in the newspapers. One company said in an advertisement, "Lonely nights are long; accompany you to dispel worries and relieve boredom." Another said, "Where can you find beauties of national charm? Search for charming faces here." They probably feared that people wouldn't believe them, so they even printed photos of "charming faces" to show their sincerity. As for those who advertise under the name of "generosity" or who call for customers by saying that "beautiful female staff members will personally distribute stimulating and exciting souvenirs to all," that is even more common and nothing special.</p>
<p>To have tour guides use "national charm" and "charming faces" to attract customers, the reason for this is already profound enough, not to mention the stimulating and exciting souvenirs. But if you use "Lonely nights are long; accompany you to dispel worries and relieve boredom" as an annotation for "tour guide," it is probably not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Because they "accompany you to dispel worries and relieve boredom," in addition to "charming faces," understanding and catering to the "customer's psychology" naturally becomes an even more important condition. So one company's advertisement said, "We have experts to train our staff in how to respond to customers," "We have experts to manage our staff's makeup," "We have experts to study customer psychology." With so many "experts" training them, the "staff members" who come out for interviews are naturally ones that "the customer loves and is reluctant to let go."</p>
<p>In this difficult era, ordinary citizens need a little "stimulation" to numb their souls. It is no longer something that can be changed by simply scolding them. And they understand that everything needs a beautiful coat to serve as a talisman. Although the road hidden by the beautiful coat is a road to depravity, this road to depravity is supported by life. Therefore, high-sounding terms like "public morals" have no effect on it. At most, the beautiful coat is torn and replaced with another, but the core remains the same, and may even be more terrifying.</p>
<p>Therefore, what I am worried about is not the weeping and wailing of moralists, but that this pathological phenomenon will not last long. At that time, the ordinary citizens who seek stimulation to numb their souls will no longer have the strength to do so. So there is no need to scold them anymore. All the beautiful coats will have lost their power of seduction, and the day of total collapse will have arrived.</p>
<p>Although I am afraid to see such a phenomenon, I hope it will come, because I know that it will come sooner or later, and no force can stop it.</p>
<p>And behind the decay, new light will use these corpses as fertilizer to bloom brilliant flowers.</p>
<h3>Child (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xiu Yang</p>
<p>I was educating my child in that way.</p>
<p>But in early spring this year, my child fell seriously ill. For the first time, I paid twenty-four yuan for a doctor to prescribe medicine. The child was sick for two months, and the medical expenses took away four months of my salary. My mother prayed every day in front of the Guanyin statue, willing to make any sacrifice as long as the child got better. But I still felt that the sacrifice was too great. On the night when the child was in the most danger, my mother unintentionally said that he was a debt owed from a previous life, so he came to "collect a debt." Having a child is "repaying a debt." This statement has a profound meaning, at least in my personal opinion.</p>
<p>The child got better, and by the time he recovered and got out of bed, he had almost completely changed, although he still retained his uniquely stubborn personality. He gave up everything that children liked. He was no longer a "philanthropist" or a "fun-loving child." He was silent and rarely smiled, like adults who have encountered unpleasant things. A six-year-old child resembled a sixty-year-old man. I was very unhappy with his behavior, and I tried even harder to restore his innocence, but it was no use. Until now, my mother still says that he has a "noble appearance" and that "he will definitely have good fortune in the future after surviving a great disaster."</p>
<p>My education has failed!</p>
<p>While the child was sick, my wife became pregnant again. My mother was naturally very happy. She calculated the time of delivery and used various "fortune-telling" methods to guess whether the future little life would be a boy or a girl. Mothers of the same age as my mother, because my eldest child "survived a great disaster" and now there is the joy of another child this year, often discussed "children" and "good fortune" with laughter.</p>
<p>Before my wife gave birth, one day under the lamp, my mother suddenly asked me whether I preferred to have a boy or a girl. Since the child came to "collect a debt," then it didn't matter whether it was a boy or a girl. I answered my mother frankly that it was good to have either. But my mother asked me with a joyful heart, and I, as my mother's "debt-collecting" child, should naturally guess whether she preferred to have a boy or a girl first. So I answered her like this:</p>
<p>"It is naturally better to have a boy, but there should also be a girl."</p>
<p>This answer exactly matched my mother's intention, although she knew that this was the slipperiest answer. The whole family waited for my wife's labor in joy.</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, my wife went into labor and gave birth to a boy, but he died after three minutes. This made my mother somewhat unhappy. She naturally treasured her eldest grandson, who "will definitely have good fortune in the future," even more.</p>
<p>I felt as if my wife had never been pregnant or given birth to a child. I had "repaid" a "debt" and felt an unparalleled relief. But looking at my eldest child, who was still so "precocious," I became sad again. I didn't know how to educate this "creditor."</p>
<p>Although my mother liked that silent and rarely smiling "noble appearance."</p>

<p>On the Provincial Highway</p>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>—Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<p>Carrying an uneasy heart, rushing out from Black Tooth's ambush by the wolf pack, at least, one can say that it was supreme luck. However, one cannot let that make one's heart calm down. Thinking of that place not far away -- said to have the same perilousness as Jiupanzi -- one cannot stop one's heart from leaping. I wondered what kind of scene it would be, my thoughts tinged with a bit of leniency --</p>
<p>-- Perhaps, late at night, it won't be as terrifying as they say?</p>
<p>Listening to the wheels grinding against the broken road surface, listening to the echoes of the wind from the valley: the moonlight thinly veiled the floating clouds, the mountains and fields still held a chaotic outline. Judging by the rate of speed, we had traveled about five miles from where we started. As for human traces? Humph, you couldn't even find the traces of ghosts.</p>
<p>After that, the driver spoke up again:</p>
<p>-- If a lone traveler walked this road at night, he'd be as good as dead! The meaning of the words, we all understood. However, he overlooked the fact that since the highway was already open to cars, why would a lone traveler need to travel the night road?</p>
<p>-- But there still have to be people traveling on this road! I added: Small merchants rushing to the market, aren't they still rushing along the long night road with the stars above their heads?</p>
<p>-- Naturally, but those goods aren't worth much money. For the sake of "knowing the local roads," they might be considered an extra boundary. Even if not, they can pull out the weapon from their chest, and a single spear can fight against a horse for quite a few rounds!</p>
<p>"Weapon"? "Fight"? My thoughts turned rapidly a few times, and I thought of the cloth bag that the porter was carrying on the mountain road, tightly wrapped around his waist. It seemed like there was something inside. At first, I always thought it was just packed with dry rations, but now I know that in addition to dry rations, there was also a "weapon" that could be used to "fight." Life originally takes different forms. In the mountainous countries that have not broken away from primitive life, there is also a way to adapt to themselves.</p>
<p>Because of this, the problem is solved: when they can "fight," they "fight." If they can't, they flee or even sacrifice themselves. If they encounter not people, but another group, the principle is also "the same."</p>
<p>As we walked, we gradually fell into a drowsy sleep again. Suddenly, after the entire car jolted twice, it stopped. The driver nudged Xiao Liu next to him, with a warning tone!</p>
<p>Be careful, ahead!</p>
<p>On the road five feet away, two people were sleeping soundly. To say they were sleeping, of course, wasn't accurate. Why were they lying in the middle of the road? Why in such a critical location? No need to say more, our nerves stimulated us to think in another direction. So, Ah Huang took out his weapon -- two people, easy to deal with, unless they don't come!</p>
<p>Finally, the two people got up, walked over slowly, bowing deeply, their faces gray. The turban on their heads had already rolled askew to one side. They looked like small merchants rushing to the market, but we couldn't see any carrying pole or frame.</p>
<p>-- Please, kind sirs, have pity on us! they said, their voices mournful. We are two brothers, preparing to go to the Black God Temple to rush to the market, but alas, the entire basket of salt cakes was taken away. After a pause, How can we explain it when we get home? We thought of Zazuo, or Xifeng, which is closer, to borrow some goods or money from relatives, but the journey is so long, our dry rations won't allow us to do that. We saw the lights from afar and lay down to seek saviors. Please, kind sirs, allow us to hitch a ride! Finally, they cried, their appearance very realistic.</p>
<p>We believed that it was definitely not oversensitivity. Someone with hidden intentions often uses various methods to achieve their ultimate goal. We certainly couldn't casually agree to this sudden event. Only after repeated questioning did we accept their request. Judging by the situation, even if they were really in disguise, it wouldn't matter; our weapons would be superior to their clumsy knives and guns.</p>
<p>After a while, the unpleasant thoughts dissolved. They were honest merchants who couldn't resist the fierce robberies even with iron rulers. Their hearts were sincere, and in such a short time, we became quite familiar. We shared the same indignation about their unfortunate robbery. Truly, it was a very bad year, and the place was barren. In their thoughts, they might think that our lives were in the so-called thirty-three heavens!</p>
<p>They got off at Zazuo.</p>
<h3>Cow</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>In June, I used the excuse of escaping the summer heat to sneak back to my hometown. I spent my days holed up in my room, fanning myself with a broken palm-leaf fan, wanting nothing more than to bury myself deep like a hibernating insect, hidden from everyone. But, perhaps because of my academic background, my relatives and friends in the countryside were curious and eager to engage with me. I thought that hiding away for too long wouldn't do, so like a weary migrating goose, I lonely returned to my old nest—Shanghai.</p>
<p>I intended to pick up my pen again and spend my life filling up the square grids of manuscript paper. But, unexpectedly, I received a letter from ×× Middle School, asking me to teach a few classes. The school was near the countryside, and for the sake of food and my health, I agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>I had spent over ten years sitting on a bench listening to teachers lecturing with gestures. But standing on the podium myself to teach others was a first for me. Whether it was a first or not, I had to teach. So, I stood on the podium. After speaking for fifty minutes, the order was quite good, probably because I wore a pair of nearsighted glasses and my face always looked as somber as a cloudy day.</p>
<p>A cow just put to the plow is always fast, fast… it only wants to move forward and doesn't care whether the field is plowed straight or crooked. I am a cow just put to the plow. As I walked off the podium, I heard a student say, "This teacher speaks too fast and says too much." I walked straight to the lounge, feeling like golden flies were dancing before my eyes. I was too tired, like a tired cow just unhitched from the plow.</p>
<p>They have to attend classes for about 250 minutes each day, while I only teach for 100 minutes. But in terms of fatigue, I far surpass them. Besides attributing it to my poor health, I can only say that I am a cow just put to the plow!</p>
<p>What gives me the biggest headache is the heavy burden of grading papers. Over 130 student papers consume all my time. Jing Jun, my colleague in the same room, is also grading over 80 papers. We put our desks together, and all the desk space is completely taken up by the papers. Like the waves of an early morning tide, one batch goes away, and another batch comes. Saturdays are even worse. Diaries, large characters, small characters, five or six hundred books piled up like a small mountain. One careless move, and it will collapse. However, dealing with these many books depends on Sundays, which ordinary people must rest on.</p>
<p>Since I am a cow, I certainly have to work on Sundays. I grit my teeth, regardless of morning or night, holding a pen, with my head down, checking, circling, dotting, adding. Thus, my life vanishes in the piles of papers. Even the sadness that used to be close to me gradually leaves me. Under the blazing lights, I find even the time to drink a glass of plain water precious. As soon as I get into bed, I fall sound asleep. When I wake up, I go to the podium, burying my head in papers.</p>
<p>Is this life fortunate or unfortunate? Late at night, waking from a dream, I occasionally hear the rustling rain on the old ginkgo tree, which gives rise to melancholy and insomnia. I warn myself, I cannot keep wasting my life like this. Am I not becoming soulless? I am really like a cow, both stupid and dull. Besides a coarse meal, I have almost lost everything. I am already a machine. Apart from work, there is nothing else. Indeed, this exactly fits the conditions of a cow: docile, hardworking, enduring hardship… I shout, I am a cow.</p>
<p>Facing life head-on, all dreams vanish. But I am a good dreamer. I like to live in dreams, whether they are crimson, purple, gray, or even black… As long as they are dreams, I like to dream them. But at this moment, there are no dreams at all, which makes me quite sad.</p>
<p>What will be the result of living this kind of life for a hundred years? Jing Jun certainly feels this question too. But he says, perhaps to console himself, "Personally speaking, this is right. But you have to think about it, supposing we teach this generation of children well, and this generation of children teach another generation of children well, what will the effect be on social progress a hundred years later? We are great." He laughs confidently and cheerfully.</p>
<p>Upon closer thought, this makes a lot of sense. But I am still a big child who doesn't understand anything. How can I teach others well? Supposing I really have a little power to teach this generation of children well, I would rather lose all my dreams and be a cow, docile, hardworking, enduring hardship… I shout, I will always be a cow.</p>

<h3>Song Introduction</h3>
<p>Children of Nature</p>
<p>Song from the Lianhua film "Go to Nature": Coral shore, surging waves, sea breeze strokes long willows; my home is deep among white clouds, green mountains reflect the evening glow. Skirts woven from grass, clothes made of leather, not afraid of wind and snow; capture tigers on land, slay dragons at sea, have the strength to defeat enemies. Cast nets early, plow the fields late, work by the setting sun. The superior wins, the inferior loses, hand in hand, go to nature.</p>

<p>Afterthoughts</p>
<p>Since Xinsheng Radio moved to the new address of the Zhengjia Muqiao Renfang Hotel, it has been actively arranging things. Now the antenna has been completed, and the broadcast room is also being painted. Broadcasting will begin soon.</p>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Zhang Yangzhang, a cartoonist from the Sino-Western Radio Station, hosts the "Weekly Cartoon Lecture." This week's topic is "Overview of Cartoon Brushstrokes." In addition, Mr. Zhang's carefully crafted masterpiece, "Sketch Cartoons," has now been published. The selling price only recovers the cost of 15 cents. Listeners of my cartoon seat who send letters to the radio station to purchase will have the author personally sign and send it as a souvenir.</p>
