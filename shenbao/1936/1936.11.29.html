<h3 id="c56">意國承認偽滿 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在舉世惶惶然注視日德同盟發展的時候。據日來外電所傳。日意已經締結重要協定。這協定與日德間的軍事同盟。雖有不同。但其中將有一重要點。卽日本先承認意國兼併阿比西亞尼。以交換意國的承認偽滿洲國。這恊定的第一步。據昨日報載路透社東京電。巳經言之繫鑿。主要是日本承認意國對阿的統治權。改阿迭斯阿比巴的使館爲領署。同時意國則開放給日本以在阿的商業權利。作爲初步的報答。這决議案已經呈交日本內閣。卽待批准。在這第一步實現以後。意國的承認僞滿。是要立刻實行的。</p>
<p>日本的承認意國兼併阿國。除了違反國際道義。蔑視一個弱小民族的主權　外。對於我們還沒有直接的利害關係。但是意國假若承認了僞滿。則簡直就是蔑視了我們的領土主權。助長了侵略我們者的氣滔。五年以來。中國在敵人侵凌壓迫之下。雖然還沒有整個的收復失地的行動。但對於東北四省的主權。却沒有一個人會喪心病狂。表示願意放棄。所以對於美國史汀生的不承認主義。卽使是一個空洞的聲明。我們也以非常的快慰。歡迎這種同情的表示。對於中美薩爾伐多的承認僞國。卽使它是一個微末不足道的小國。我們也以非常的激忿。抨擊這種無恥的勾當。由於這樣。幾年以來。還沒有別的國家敢冒天下之大不韙。爲遠東的侵略者作應聲蟲。現在。假使意國竟會這樣做了。中國除了根本不承認這種侵略者的私下買賣以外。對於意國的違背道義。也將更加深了我們的不信任。</p>
<p>不過。就情勢上看。這决意國的承認僞滿。大概已到了必然實行的程度了。在本年夏間。意國宣佈併吞阿國之後。就有過一個消息。說它將派遣一個使臣東來。留駐滿洲。作爲事實上的承認偽國。但是當時意國的侵阿。顯然失去了全世界人士的同情。而德國與僞滿的簽訂商務協定。破壞中國主權。也受到了各方面的責難。結果意國終於失去了勇氣。把承認僞滿的計劃延擱下來。不過在這延擱約期間。德意的妥洽成立了。最近日德的同盟又訂定了。留下來的日意協定。自然也在積極拉攏之中。這三個法西斯强國的結合。其基本作用當然爲增强侵略勢力。其直接影響無疑的是犧牲弱小民族。打擊和平勢力。現在。我們雖然想盡力置身事外。而事實上我們領土主權的尊嚴。最先就要被蔑視了。</p>
<p>據說日德意三國間的同盟協定。今後還要盡量擴大。尤其想「勸誘」我國加入。當然。我們是被侵略國。絕不能加入侵略國的集團。自己甘願作犧牲品。相反的。我們要抵制這種侵略集團的威脅。而且要積極與和平友好的國家親善。把自己從侵略者的圈套中解放出來。</p>

<p>欲達到光明之路—必須健全頭腦和身心！　更要奮力除去毀滅生活力的神經衰弱症！</p>
<p>在學生時代的青年。他們對於頭腦明晰。和記憶力堅強法的渴望。好比饑民的求食。這是像老人的探求。不老長壽法——和返老還童法同一心理。</p>
<p>在青春時代。生理上因生殖器之內分泌的活動。易起性的煩惱。精神上因知識慾望高每好亂讀。因此煩惱更甚。至於考試時的煩惱狀態。那是更加勢烈了！所以現在的青年學子。差不多有十之七八。都感覺神經衰弱的悲哀。</p>
<p>神經衰弱－是在黑暗中毀滅青春生活力的惡魔！這病能使前途有為的青年。一變而為可憐無用之殘身。人生的幸福。盡付東流。這是何等可怕的病症。</p>
<p>腦為神經系統的根源地。由腦部發出的神經織微。好比樹枝一樣。散佈到全身各組織各器官。吾人一切之動作。都要由腦頌發命令——由神經作為傳導！而營其全體生存上生活現象。所以加爾說：「人類之本能。情緒·思想·天才·欲念。以及腦為策源地」。由此觀之。腦為人身主宰－換句話說。腦就是我余的生命線。那麼。若要挽救神經的衰弱。就非補給腦部的營養不可。</p>
<p>要想培植健全的頭腦和驅除毀滅生命力的神經衰弱。增進智力。堅強意志。惟有常時服用Memory　Neurolic「米美爾補腦汁」。可以使腦力健全。神經強壯。精力旺足。這樣才能得到頭腦明晰。思想靈敏。記憶堅強的效果。現在各國醫師證明「米美爾補腦汁」有挽救衰弱－培補腦力的權威。並經調查歐美各大醫院診療之報告。確有數千萬落伍的青年。服用此藥後。已復得健康。底於成功之境。</p>

<p>— 朱大新醫師</p>
<p>惟有內分泌製劑已經全球名醫公認　非但能夠立刻平復病人的呼吸－並且還有迅速治癒不發的靈效</p>
<p>哮喘。舊醫謂之痰飲。此為氣管支狹隘。氣阻喘鳴。時發時止之呼吸困難也。本症於發作時之病狀。其苦痛有非筆墨所可形容。基患者併發心臟疾患。則尤為危險。逢暴發之際。苟救治不發。能生急劇之惡變－而立刻招致不測之禍－死亡的慘果－即或向無心臟疾患之哮喘病者。若不早期治癒。迨根深蒂固。頻頻發作。終久亦多續發肺臟氣腫。生命之原動力的心臟。遂受壓迫。不能行使其職務。而妨害循環作用。況又因肺氣腫－障礙呼吸機能。即於平日亦覺呼吸困難。如同桎梏之困。故患者心肺皆病。生命隨時有危險之慮。</p>
<p>哮喘一症。在昔日因無特效之藥物。故中外醫家。均視為頑固難以治癒之疾患。而病家大多祇知發作時仇求解除其痛苦。但在發作停止以後。即不求根治方法。誠如俗語所謂之「臨死抱佛腳」。概不知未雨綢繆之計也。況普通氣喘藥品。雖能暫時見平喘止咳之效。實因含有麻醉劑之功用。待藥性一過。遂仍復原狀。患者倘逢發即用。終有成為慢性中毒之虞。故對於服用氣喘藥品。務宜慎重。不可亂投。</p>
<p>近日各國醫師對哮喘病之治療。一致推獎內分泌製劑。本劑非但能立刻平復病人之呼吸。並且有迅速根治能使記久汪發之靈妙。此種內分泌製劑雖具有如此偉大之特效。但藥內不含絲毫麻醉之物質。其功效純係天然作用。於人體絕對安全妥當。毫無流弊。故患者可採用本劑。自己行內服療法。亦能達到美滿之結果。</p>
<p>內分泌製劑中惟「哮立平」Holipin藥為世界各國醫師所最賞用者。「哮立平」之效能平喘利氣·除痰益肺強心·對各種哮喘。不論老人小兒。服之均有特效。且甚安全。</p>
<h3 id="c139">肺病患者應深切的認識　用化學藥劑殺菌是盲目的療法 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 波蘭Dr.Kamsler　M.D作沈兆荃醫師譯</p>
<p>治愈肺病之捷徑惟施行臟器療法最為安全妥當</p>
<p>肺結核之療法。究以何者為有效。此實重要之問題。不可不深究也。用強烈之藥。撲滅結核菌（即癆菌）。固為一般人所想到。但證諸事實。結核菌抵抗力級強。如果以可殺此菌之強烈藥品。使患者服下或者注射。　恐藥力未及細菌。而人體已先受其害。故患者欲以化學毒烈之藥品。撲滅肺內之結核菌。實為至愚之思想也。世上有幾千幾百種之療肺藥品。爭售於市。而誇稱其為撲滅結核菌之特效藥者。此無非籍以迎合病家之心理。而遂其斂錢之目的。至於此等藥品之實效。僅不過輔助患者之消化。與減輕其咳嗽。作為療養上之補助而已。若患者誤認此類藥品。為根本療法。實為大謬也。</p>
<p>觀肺病療法之近況。可謂極其混沌。使人不知擇何法為佳。故今日欲舉行撲滅結核運動。其最重要者。即為使一般民眾澈底瞭解肺病之正確與安全療法。以包圍結核之病灶（即肺之病部）。待敵（結核菌）自滅之為得策。如欲達到此目的。則全在乎增進患者自身之防禦機能（即所謂抗力者）使其強盛。方為合理。蓋人能將結核菌圍困。且於病部之周圍增生結締組織之堤防。築成極堅固之防禦線。使此菌不能奪圍而出。並絕其糧道。於是結核菌失其活動。而歸死滅。以致肺病可安全痊癒。故吾人欲與結核菌戰。非有此天然強盛之防禦機能。實不足惟制其死命也。</p>
<p>欲使肺病得速就治愈。不得不施以適當之方法。以增進患者體內之防禦機能。此種療法。並非化學藥劑所可奏效。惟有臟器療法能達到防禦機能旺盛之目的。患者須確實認識治愈肺病之捷徑。捨臟器療法之外。無更佳之法者。讀者如能將此正確安全之肺病的臟器療法。廣為傳佈。則世人所受結核之犧牲者。必可大減。以個而言。欲脫離病苦。免於病死。絕非難事也。</p>
<p>茲有德國鐵比亞大藥廠根據上文所述治癒肺病之原理。參用柏爾託爾特A.A.Bei　thold　柏龍石卡Brown　Sequard及史泰林Starling諸大家所發明臟器療法之學說。而採取壯健動物之新鮮肺臟及脾臟人。施以科學方法。提練其中有效成分。（即內分泌素－荷爾蒙者）再與各種益肺補身等珍貴藥品混合。而製成一種療肺特效內服液。定其名曰「肺活」Pbith　Weal　曾經世界各國肺病療養院。作長期臨床試騐。認「肺活」確能使病而衰萎之肺臟機能復活。增強其生體臟器之抵抗力。並可增進白血球之食菌作用。同時鼓舞全體細胞機能而發揮人體天然之防禦力。增殖結締經胞。填補病部之缺損。並在病部周圍築成堡壘形的結締織牆壁。使發硬化。催促疤痕之形成。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌。禁其活動。並受白血球之圍攻。令其自形消滅。故服用此種「肺活」Pbith　Weal者。能令體內自然產生抗毒素。增加名疫及抗菌作用。</p>
<p>本劑因具有上述諸種特別之效能。不論一·二·三期之肺癆。久咳·氣急·咯血·潮熱·盜汗等病症。服「肺活」之後。可於數日內獲得不可思議之效果。倘能安心服用至二三月之時期。無不痊癒也。</p>

<p>— 章元貞</p>
<p>急宜施用補腎強精劑來補救</p>
<p>孔子曰：「少年血氣未定。戒之在色。」蓋男女當春情發動期。性慾興奮。最能影響於肉體精神。德之社會學者名之曰：「為人生最危險之時期。」凡淫慾無度者。則精髓枯槁。腎部虧損。斬傷真元。以致身弱多病。大都青年之肺癆。均起於好色兒也。</p>
<p>每見青年子弟。年方髻稚。情竇初開。或偷年淫書小說。或同學戲語褻穖。因而妄生慾火。往往籍手淫而暗洩至寶。或逍遙於花柳場中。亂淫無度。或於夜夢洩遺精。皆足以消耗精力。損傷元氣。於是。漸漸肢體贏弱。飲食減少。腰痛腿軟。頭暈。目眩。憂鬱。頭痛。健忘。失眠。致神經衰弱各症疊現。為父母者驚懼。不知所措。或以為先天不足。或以為風寒所感。或以為補養失宜。實則皆自作之孽也。</p>
<p>先哲有言：「色為少年第一關。」此關打不過。任他高才絕學。都不能得力。蓋萬事以身為本。身乃以精為寶。故精水不竭。則耳目聰明。身心健全。如油之養燈。油不竭則燈不滅。慾火焚燒。清神易竭。遂至腎虧體衰。終成虛癆。死於非命。可不畏哉。</p>
<p>慾海無邊。回頭是岸。此少年所當猛省者也。</p>
<p>身體上之衛生</p>
<p>春情發動期之性慾極易衝動。尤易誤犯手淫惡癖。故宜避刺激性之興奮。切忌飲酒。因酒能引起性慾。青年須遠避之。</p>
<p>平日宜注意心身之修養。改除一切不良習慣。行正當之衛生。常至野外散步。行有益之運動。避免身心過勞。如身體衰弱者。多攝取滋養食品。據衛生學大家斯託爾博士謂：犯手淫惡癖而難於戒絕之人。皆為先天性神經質者。因意志薄弱。不能自制引種行為。故宜施用神經強壯劑滋養其腦力。健全其身心。而意志得以堅強。可自尅制手淫噁癖。此劑試騐多人。均有美滿之成績。皆呈年富力強之氣概雲。</p>
<p>神經衰弱特效療法</p>
<p>神經衰弱。為手淫及房事過度者必發之症。例如頭重。頭痛·暈眩·健忘·失眠·盜汗·心悸·記憶力減退。全身疲勞·腰痛酸痛·作事無恒·皮膚蒼白·身體贏瘦·精神抑鬱·夜間夢洩遺精等。皆屬於神經衰弱之病狀。</p>
<p>本症最特效之療法。以神經強壯劑之補腦汁確實適當。但修養與衛生。仍須同時注重。</p>
<p>神經強壯劑。首推德國「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurolic服後確有不可思議之效力云。</p>
<p>補腎強精救治色癆</p>
<p>早婚縱慾。手淫斬傷。俱能耗損元陽。能使生殖器性的機能發生障礙，如陰萎，早洩，發育不全，夢洩，遺精等症。倘欲挽救－使性機能恢復健全，當用補精強壯劑靈騐且無流弊者。惟以分泌聯合製劑為最有效。因本品係取雄壯動物之睾丸精製成。患者服用後。能促進生殖器之生理機能。製造精液之作用旺盛。全身活力。元氣充足。精力倍增云。</p>
<p>內分泌聯合製劑。首推「還爾童」Well　Tonic本品為強精補腎挽救色癆腎虧之聖藥。且毫無熱燥性烈之弊。服完一二瓶。即見著效。如冬間用作滋補，可保持青春挽救早老之威力</p>

<h3 id="c141">法商耀武揚威　東華遭逢空前慘敗　法商以八比二之鉅數獲勝　甲組錦標東華前途多荊棘　陣容零落為昨日失敗主因 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>東華足球隊、昨在逸園、與法商作上海西聯足球甲組賽、第一次循環賽、兩隊各擁最高紀錄、抱染指錦標之雄心、鏖戰結果、東華竟以二與八之比、遭遇空前未有之慘敗、東華自有史以來、尚屬第一遭也、逸園內觀衆的七千人無不垂頭喪氣、上半時東華尚能抵禦、僅以零比一落後、下半時竟敗得落花流水、洞門大開、十分鐘內連失五球之多、此戰關係甲組錦標至鉅、希望將來第二循環中、東華能報復挽回也、</p>
<p>戰局經過</p>
<p>昨戰形勢、法商猖獗非凡、翻雲覆雨、完全操其掌握之中、上半時東華勉力抵禦、尚能抵擋一陣、直至開賽後十五分鐘、才被大華特射入一球、球雖大半在法商脚頭之上、憑張榮才之身手、居然一一化險、迨至下半時、法商仍然銳不可當、左衝右突、十五分鐘之內、竟一連被其攻入五球、造成六比零之空前慘敗紀録、亦其後幸得內防範疏懈中、射得二球、最後八比二之數、得以不吃鴨蛋而歸、亦云大幸、東華經此挫折、宜自知有所惕　矣、</p>
<p>失敗原因</p>
<p>東華全隊昨日之表演、觀衆印象之惡劣、可謂無以復加、全隊一盤散沙、根本毫無合作可言、守衛綫之軟弱、亦爲失敗之癥結、李寗臥病、李義臣北歸、輔以莊友仁、莊旣軟弱、李亦不能作敏速之奔、治理運佑又看不住勞巴斯託夫、於後方陣地、遍段敵踪、守衝者留不散出、前鋒活動之接濟遂斷、加以前鋒綫又零洛不全、溫志豪資格與經騐俱差、小萬機會雖多、俱罕能利用、老孫阿戴、庸碌無光、反觀法商聯絡美密完善、人才之平均、守衛之堅強、東華欲求不敗、難矣哉、設無張榮才之跌擋求險、東華之敗更不堪收拾也、</p>
<p>敗後形勢</p>
<p>昨日戰後之形勢、東華以九戰而獲十五分、法商以八戰之積分、已與之相並、且以多一次出席機會、奪去東華首席他位、此後無疑、法商已可佔先兩分、但東華尚有一綫希望、卽在第二循環中、加勝法商、則積分仍可相並、將視勝球之多少、以判分錦襟、現東華之勝球、亦已爲法商超出四球、（五十比四十六）惟先球則東華較法商少八球、（十四比二十二）倘前途能順利進行、並注意於對付較弱之球隊時、增多射球紀錄、亦未始就謂絕望、但回顧東華、前途荊棘正多、似未能盡符所期望也、</p>
<p>先失一球</p>
<p>雙方開始接觸、法商全師進犯、法凡笑孤軍深入、其勢甚危、張榮才機警救出、東華乘勢反攻、阿戴門下得球、傳於萬象華、正擬力射、不意鮑春仲衝出營救、東華徒勞無功、敵軍聲勢漸盛、衆將回師侵略、深入腹地、馮運佑迎拒甚力、表演絕佳、惟敵勢方法、東華危機四伏、敵將射門、多如急盼、張榮才三次搶險、幸未出事、東華風聲鶴淚、草木皆兵、未幾敵又大舉來犯、闖過三關、二衛不能抵拒、大舉特足上生眼、迎頭一脚、球直入網中、東華先失一球、時距開賽尚不足十五分鐘、</p>
<p>飽受驚駭</p>

<p>轟！轟！轟！的砲聲，已衝破了和平之神；拍！拍！拍！的槍聲，已打破了人間之甜夢；這種可怕的景象，已足夠使人手足顫動了。</p>
<p>忽聽得號砲一聲，全隊的人馬，已飛也似的向前狂衝，他們所過的大道小路，「碧血橫飛」，「浩氣四塞」。他們爲了些什麽？他們爲了誰而拋他們的頭顱，流他們的熱血。</p>
<p>他們爲了公道而戰，他們爲了不甘屈服而求我們民族生存而戰，因此他們願犧牲一切——別了他們的父母，離了他們的兄弟姊妹，而到沙場上去拼命！</p>
<p>在前綫的軍士們呀！希望你們努力吧！奮發吧！</p>
<p>拿着你們的槍，去打倒這強權，霸道。前面是永樂的大道，願你們勇敢地過去，我願踏着你們的血跡前進！前面雖有千里之荊棘，只要有大無畏的精神，把它開出一條大道來！</p>
<h3 id="c175">一位法國小朋友的故事 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣垠</p>
<p>西曆一八六八年普法戰爭時，當普魯士的軍隊要攻取巴黎的消息傳到法國後，法人都異常感到憤慨與惶恐。正在這時候，一個年輕的孩子離開了他的家鄉，來到軍營裏。</p>
<p>「你呌什麽名字？」一個軍官問他。</p>
<p>「拉旋內，將軍」！他答。</p>
<p>「你為甚麼這樣年紀輕輕的究當了兵呢？」</p>
<p>「因為要拯救這危急的祖國」。</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>後來，他毅然的担任了人家不敢担任的一種極艱難而且極危險的工作——偵探敵情，——假扮一個聾啞子，衣襟裏放了幾片麵包和一支短笛離開他的軍隊去了。</p>
<p>不幸，他被敵軍扣起來了，並且四個惡狠狠的兵士看住了他，使他沒有脫逃的機會。</p>
<p>當拉旋內被普兵綁在野陣上預備執行極刑的一刹那，他才感到死的恐怖；內心雖像細胞一顆一顆的在那裏分裂，他表面上却絲毫沒有畏懼的顏色。</p>
<p>普軍的長官，嚴厲的問他是不是法軍的偵探，他只是搖着頭，像是說：「我是個聾啞子，聽不到你的話，也聽不懂你的話」。接着他在衣袋裏摸出了短笛，從容的吹起曲譜來。這樣，他終於被目為一個聾啞子而釋放了。</p>
<p>他從虎口逃回自己的軍營裏，詳告敵情，結果，巴黎得以轉危為安。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友：這個故事，你們聽後覺得怎麼樣呢？那時候，那個法國的孩子拉旋內非但是有極大的勇敢而且有極大的智謀，結果：法國終於靠了他而得到了最後的生存。他對於祖國的功績是多麼的偉大！</p>
<p>小朋友們：目前我們中國處境的危險時勢的嚴重，說不定也有像普法戰爭時那法國地步的一天。那時候我並不希望個個小朋友都做到拉旋內的那樣偉大事業：可是，最後，我須得供獻小朋友些意見，來做你們一種切實的準備。因為不論做什麽事，都要有充分的準備才行。</p>

<p>雁兒呀！</p>
<p>你莫非聽說北方有什麽消息，</p>
<p>這樣的怱忙！</p>

<p>冒着風霜，</p>
<p>排成「一」字兒「人」字兒的隊形，</p>

<p>— 真</p>
<p>一天，敏兒獨自呆呆的坐着，一方面他還靜靜的想着，他覺得這世界是太奇妙了。</p>
<p>「敏弟，你一個兒呆坐着幹嗎？是不是身體不舒服？」聰兒看見了他弟弟呆坐了好久，便這樣的問他。</p>
<p>「不，我身體很舒服，我不過是在想着，覺得這世界是太玄妙了。」</p>
<p>「咦，有什麽玄妙？你覺得它玄妙，玄妙在那裏？」</p>
<p>「你瞧，在我的四周，可說是沒有一樣的東西是相同的，那是一缸清水，那是一隻桌子，你想玄妙不玄妙？」</p>
<p>「有什麽玄妙？水是液體，桌子是固體，當然不會相同的。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，我倒要問你，什麽呌固體，什麽呌液體？這有什麽分別？」</p>
<p>「凡物質都分成三種狀態：（一）固體：固體是有一定的形態和體積，甚麼呌一定的形狀？就是它的形狀是不會變化的，譬如一隻桌子，它的形狀總是那樣從來沒有看見今天的桌子是方的，而到了明天，變成了圓的了。（二）液體：液體是有一定的體積，但是它的形狀是隨了容納它的器具而變化的。甚麼呌一定的體積？譬如你把一面盆的水要放一隻茶杯裏，那麼這一隻杯一定不能容納這一面盆的水，便從杯口鋪出來了，這都因為它的體積是有一定的。不過它的形狀是千變萬化。（三）氣體：氣體是沒有一定的形狀和體積，它是最奇妙了。我們不能看見它，那當然無從知道它的形狀和體積了。但是在自然界中更有一件奇怪的事，就是有一種液體，它能變成固體和氣體，但也能從固體和氣體再變成它本來的原狀，你知道它是什麽東西？」</p>
<p>「那液體便是水，它可以說是世界中最重要的東西，也是最奇妙的東西。水是種液體，那是大家都知道，如果它遇到了熱，便化成水蒸氣，這水蒸氣便是氣體了。但水蒸氣如果遇到了冷，便又變成雨水，便是由水蒸氣變成的液體。水遇到了冷，便凝結成冰，冰是固體，但是冰遇到了熱，一部分化成水蒸氣，一部分化成水了。這樣的循環不息，可說是一件很奇怪的事，但是別的東西，都不會如此循環不息的。」</p>
<h3 id="c178">做一朵菊花 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 陳鐵吾</p>
<p>明兒跟父親參觀了菊花會，對父親說：「爸爸！請你買幾盆回去，過年時供在家裏，很有趣哩！」父親說：「傻孩子！天冷了。菊花就要枯萎的，那能長到過年呢？」明兒又問道：「有沒有方法呌它不枯呢？」父親　一　鬍　，說：「有的。我回家告訴你。」</p>
<p>明兒的父親，帶了明兒，經過一家紙店，他父親買了一張白杭連，一張黃紙，隨後又在一家雜貨鋪裏，買了二尺細鉛絲，他對明兒說：「回去我做一朵菊花，和你剛才看見的一樣，並且永久不會枯萎的。」</p>
<p>他父親到了家，把白紙摺了幾摺，在中間用綫縫牢，（如圖一）隨後取了一隻小碗，——有圓規更好——覆在摺好的紙上，用鉛筆在小碗四周，畫了一圈，並用剪刀剪去不用部分，（如圖二）接着把圓形白紙，用鉛筆分為若干等份，成菊花瓣形，並用剪刀剪開，（如圖三）然後把剪好的花瓣，放在腿上，用錐子一柄，將錐尖放在花瓣尖端，用力向後拉，花瓣就蜷曲起來，和真花瓣無異。（如圖四）等到全部花瓣做妥了，再把白紙一張一張剝開來，用漿糊粘到做妥的花心上去。（如圖五）就成了一朵菊花。</p>
<p>（花心的做法很簡單，只用黃紙摺了幾摺，用鉛絲束住下部，再用剪刀把上部剪成細絲就是了。）</p>
<p>他把菊花做成了，問明兒說：「像真的菊花嗎？」明兒說：「像極了。」明兒接着問道：「白菊花做法是如此，紅菊花呢？黃菊花呢？……」父親說：「那很容易，要做有顏色的菊花，只消在白紙未摺以前，塗上所需要的顏色就是了。」</p>
<p>小朋友：你喜歡菊花嗎？有暇時，做一朵玩玩，不很好嗎？</p>

<p>— 志淵</p>
<p>我們中國現在，受着敵人很厲害的侵略，不久定要全力去抵抗他們，要和他們發生大戰的。在這次戰爭中，最可怕的，是敵人施放毒氣，如果我們呼吸到了這種毒氣以後，輕的受傷，重的送命，生命就很危險。所以我們現在，就應該先要有一點防毒的常識，好在將來的戰爭中，如果敵人施放毒氣時，我們有所預防，不至於受害。</p>
<p>後面，便是一點防毒常識，希望大家知道以後，再講給別人聽。</p>
<p>毒氣彈破裂的時候，響聲很小，飛流出許多烟雾，或液體，並且有特別的臭味。遇到這種情形，我們就可以知道，敵人是在放毒氣了。</p>
<p>這時，我們就得心情鎮靜，想些防禦的方法；切不可慌張亂跑，因為這既無濟於事，而且因為心臟跳動，呼吸短促，結果把毒氣吸入得很多了。</p>
<p>在家裏，先要預備好毛氈棉簾之類的東西，當放毒氣時，立即把窗戶房門密密張沒，以防毒氣侵入。倘能設備好密不通風的防毒室，那是更好了。家裏的食物，要拿密不通風的食物罩蓋好，水井要蓋好，以防沾染毒素。</p>
<p>倘若要逃避開毒氣呢，那得要注意風向，向那和風向成直角的路上走去。譬如吹的是西風，就應該向北或南跑，不可向東跑，因為順了風走，毒氣終是跟在後面，永遠逃不脫的。</p>
<p>再要知道，毒氣比空氣重，所以低的地方毒氣濃厚，像田野，森林，山谷等地方，都去不得，最好逃到避毒室裏去，跑到樓上去，把窗戶閉緊了，是可以少受些毒的。</p>
<p>事先，每人要預備好兩個防毒面具，放毒氣時，就戴上防毒面具，放毒氣時，就戴上避毒。如果沒有防毒面具的，那末可以把毛巾手帕等浸濕肥皂水或尿水液覆蓋在口鼻上，或拿竹筒貯泥土，浸入尿水裏，接在口鼻上，以供呼吸，並且立即逃避到沒有毒氣的高地方或山上。</p>
<p>如果已經中了毒氣，那末趕快移到空氣新鮮的地點，小心地脫去衣服，用熱水淋洗全身，設法保持住體溫，喝些開水，茶或者咖啡，再請醫生按照毒氣的性質來醫治。如果受着了腐爛性的毒氣時，那末趕快用漂白粉溶液來洗滌全身。受毒的人，要安靜，不可以亂動亂抓，激動身體，以免毒性發作，加深受害的程度。</p>
<h3 id="c181">小朋友們，起來！ <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 大孩子</p>
<p>——一封寫給全國小朋友的信</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>我時常和你們通信，但是沒有機會；現在，我因為有着許多事情非和你們談談不可，所以，便借了這園地的一角，寫了這樣一封公開信給你們。</p>
<p>目前，我們的國家已到了暴風雨的時代，我們的民族危亡已到了最後關頭，我們如果還有人心，如果不願做亡國奴的話，只有掮起我們的責任，起來自救。尤其是小朋友們，不應該再躲在父母的懷抱裏享福，不應該再嬌生慣養地做着任性的小姐哥兒了，因為你們是民族的基石，國家的未來主人翁，為國家，為民族，必須訓練自己，鼓勵別人，都成為愛國熱心的同志。</p>
<p>近幾天來，偽匪侵綏，舉國同憤，幸賴我前方守土將領，邊塞熱血健兒，奮起抗敵，現在火綫上的英雄，正在冰天雪地中，砲火烽烟裏，浴血抗戰，他們忘記了自己的生命，忘記了身上的寒冷，只爲着祖國的山河，為着整個民族的生存而鬥爭，而犧牲，可是，親愛的小朋友，我們對那些民族英雄，應該怎樣的景仰，怎樣的敬佩呢？</p>
<p>最近全國各地都羣起援綏運動，並慰勞前敵將士；我們祗要開每天的報紙來看看，各界的自動熱烈捐輸，上至大人先生，下及販夫走卒，大的十萬，小的一角，有的甚至還在發起什麽一日運動，一角運動，一週運動，和絕食運動，這可見我們民族確已比過去覺醒得多了，雖然這些什麽運動什麽運動，未免有點兒做作，但他們的愛國熱忱終究是值得嘉許的。</p>
<p>雖然，我們如今年紀還小，談不到戰死疆場，然而我們愛國的熱心却出自天真，並未較成人為弱，況且前方將士的忠勇，還少不了後方民眾的接濟鼓勵；我現在希望全國的小朋友，一致起來援綏，將平日遊戲，玩具，糖果等費積下來，或購辦應用慰勞品，送交報　團帶代為輸送前方，並且隨時在同學中，同伴中，父母親戚間勸導捐助；我相信你們只要肯這樣去做，其成績一定是很可觀的吧！</p>
<p>現在已是怒吼的時候了；小朋友們，起來！起來！</p>

<h3 id="c182">旁人看不出的信件 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>——答南京陳惠民</p>
<p>惠民弟：</p>
<p>你告訴我們在紫金山麓練習追踪的情景，我們細細地想了一下，覺得你們失敗的原因並不如你所想像般地，是爲了你的隊員走錯了路。因為無論如何，我們想斷不會每個隊員都這樣走入了歧路的。</p>
<p>照我們的推測：一定是你藏在樹下的那封密函給你友隊的隊員發見了，他們既知道你們的秘密，就把你預先作好的嚮導記號改變了，結果當然是你的隊員都走錯了。不知你對我們的推想以為如何？</p>
<p>但是無論我們的推想對不對，下次你們再來練習追踪時，一定設計得更嚴密些才是。單說你的密函吧，無論把它怎樣安放在那裏，你總得設法給隊員們一個暗示，普通是畫一個藏信記號在明顯的地方。但你可用不着一定要這樣辦，祗要你和隊員們預先約好，藏信記號不妨改換一個方式。聰明的童子軍是常常會秘密地改用「前進號」代替「止步號」，而以「止步號」代替「前進號」的呢！還有你可以預先告訴隊員，週轉灣，大樹或大石或者會有藏信，那麼你的藏信記號就不必寫在明顯的地方了呀：此對於新建的內容，你又何必明白地寫出來呢？難道你忘了秘密通信的妙法嗎？每一個童子軍至少應曉得三種以上的秘密通信法咧，我在這裏試舉一個簡單的例給你看：</p>
<p>你先找一張長而狹的紙條，比方把白紙上空白的邊緣剪下來，把它斜斜地顺着捲在童子軍軍棍上，然後在這上面寫上你所要寫的字，直寫或橫寫都隨你的便。那末當你寫好了除下來時，紙條上祗是些零碎的筆畫，或沒有意義的字句。等到你的隊員收到這紙條，也照樣捲在軍棍上，那麼他不就明白了長條紙的秘密了麼？不過有一點要注意的，就是紙條要越狹越好。</p>
<p>這祗是一個例子，你當然要觸類旁通地多多去發明。不過無論什麽方法都好，祗要你們兩方曉得就好，倘被別人知道了，豈不失了效用嗎？</p>
<p>願你下次的追踪，能收到美滿的結果；還望再給我們報告。請了，祝</p>
<p>努力！</p>

<p>— 海</p>
<p>柏絲可菲躺在那裏抖顫了好一會，末後伊聽得他們倆鼾聲大作，知已睡熟了。於是伊也沉沉入睡，直到陽光大放之後，纔被那老婦人喚醒了。他們倆居然給伊預備一頓很豐富的早餐，並且對伊說話時，也溫和了許多，問了伊好多的話，伊却只把自己的事情說了一半出來。他們倆靜靜地聽着，似乎很有興味，更對伊聲明昨夜搜檢伊的身上，實在是因為疑伊是一個不誠實的流民，並不要想刦取伊的錢。柏絲可菲很快樂的離開了他的屋子；但伊打開伊的錢袋瞧時，却見那八十個銅古貝，已變做一百二十個了。伊深信他們倆的原意本來確是要劫取伊的錢的，這要感謝上帝不知怎樣的使他們發起善心來，反而幫助伊哩。此外伊又受了一個最大的驚嚇。有一天清早，伊正從昨夜住宿的所在，走將出來，其他的人們都還沒有起身，街上只有伊一個人在那裏走，村中所有的狗，都追了上來。伊一面跑，一面將行杖，沒命的打去，可是越打越使它們發怒，內中有一頭狗，已抓了伊的衣裙，頓使伊撲倒在地，猛覺得一個冷冷的鼻子已着在伊的後頸上；但那狗嗅了嗅伊，連咬也不咬，這時恰好有一個農人走過，才把那些狗都趕走了。</p>
<p>嚴冬已到臨了，一連下了八天的大雪，使伊不得不停留下來；但當伊預備重行出發時，那些農人們忙對伊說要是單身在這樣的大雪堆中走去，任是最強壯的男子也要送掉性命的，因為那風把地上的積雪都捲了起來，路面已無從分辨，走過去非常的危險，因此他們就留住了伊，等一隊雪車到來，它們是帶了食物，送往意加塞林甯堡供給耶穌聖誕宴會中用的。那班雪車上的車夫們聽了伊的故事，都願意讓伊坐在他們的車中，但伊的衣服穿得很是單薄，不配作冬季的旅行，雖已把他們貨物上的包布卸下來，裏在伊的身上。可是第四天到了一處冷清的驛站上，伊畢竟受不了嚴寒的襲擊，一個面頰已經凍傷了。他們便不得不把伊從雪車上抱了下來，將雪防災伊的頰上摩擦着，對伊非常的關切；他們都說要是沒有一件羊皮的外套，那就不能帶伊前去，因為越前去越冷得厲害，那一定要把伊生生凍死的。柏絲可菲想起了不能再跟這班好心腸的人一同趕路，而驛站上又未必能留伊住下，倒弄得進退兩難，於是不由得哀哀的哭了起來。車夫們看伊怪可憐的，就答允大家湊出一筆錢來，給伊買一件羊皮外套，無奈要買又沒有買處；驛站上的人也不能放棄他們的外套，因為這是一個很偏僻的地方，要另外買一件外套，實在是不容易的。車夫們雖曾除了特別的高價，向旅館中的女侍去商量，可能出賣伊的外套，不料伊也拒絕了。</p>

<p>「大衆智識」是顧頡剛先生主編的，這大概是讀者諸君所早已知道的吧。我對於這刋物的根本印象還比較良好，覺得在目前它也應該是比較可讀的刊物之一種。不過，如果要眞芷評論的話，那它也是有不少缺點的。現在我們且看最近出版的第三期吧。</p>
<p>全般的說來，這期的「大衆知識」也和上兩期的一樣，內容還不能算豐富。譬如，哲學，社會科學，文學理論，國際政治經濟等，在這期「大衆知識」中都不能多見，甚至完全看不到，但那些却都是「大衆」所急於要求的「智識」。自然，一個半月刊的篇幅有限，不能將一切「智識」都包括進去，但在目能情形下，號稱「大衆智識」的刊物總應該有作爲一切理論之基礎的哲學，以及與大家現實生活有密切關係的國際政治經濟的。「大衆知識」注重中國古代名人生活和其爲人的介紹，用很多篇幅來刋載「漫談」「隨筆」之類的文章，這當然不能說根本不對，但比較起來，我以爲與其拿許多篇幅來刋載這些東西，倒不如多收集一點上述那些更重要的知識，以更充實刋物的內容。</p>
<p>這期「大衆知識」有四篇頗嚴正的論文：第一是吳世昌先生的「論高等敎育偏重理工的趨勢」。這篇文章對於「偏重理工」敎育，鄙視文法二科的先生們的意見，對於只重技術，輕視理論　淺薄見解，確有很適常的批評。作者且明白地指出：「一個國家在技術方面不幸而落後須要　重別國的人才」，「却並非國恥」；但假使一個國家的根本大計，自己沒有偉大的識力來裁决與處理，以致弄得一團糟，以致只好聽「友邦」或其他國家干涉挾制，那才是奇恥大辱，才是亡國的死症」；最後更結論到：「我們現在正應（一）從提倡學術思想入手，來（二）養成科學的精神，態度與方法——却並非狹義的某種技術。」這在原則上都是不可非議的。但是，吳先生在批評那些淺薄之見時，僅是理論的辯論，並未根本地指出那些「偏重理工」的技術主義者之爲少數人的利益打算的社會用意，使讀者不能更深刻地理解他們何以會採用那樣的辦法；而且，就在理論的批判中，在某些地方，他還顯示出了自己的根本立櫬之落後，如他之絕對地贊成康德，而不知道他的不可知論的錯誤。同時，更使人難解的，是吳先生在依據一般理論，依據中國的實際情形，發表他對於中國高等敎育的意見中，在表明敎育對國家，社會之積極作用中，忽然提出了「爲學問而學問」的主張，說道是「學問上最可寳貴的精神」；如果說這主張是對的，那學生讀書就司不必想到國家民族，敎育家也不要想到教育的作用，因而吳先生的敎育意見也就是多餘的了。依我看來，吳先生是把求學的功利主義，「學以致用」論與「只把學問當作敲門磚」的傾向混淆了，所以他讚揚「爲學問而學問」的精神。我們以爲爲做官發財而學問的確是不對的，但「學以致用」却是正確的主張；敎學生專心研究固無不可，但提倡「爲學問而學間」却要不得，因爲後者的意味是要人求學離開實際，「閉門造車」。事實上理科和工科自然是很實際，就是文法兩科也大有用處，這不是連吳先生都承認的嗎？因之所謂「爲學問而學問」的精神便完全是一句本話了。第二是朱寳昌先生的「國難中的聯合戰綫」，第三是連是升先生的「生產過剩與消費過少」，我們對於這兩篇文章除說內容欠充實外，尚無別的意見。最後則是顧頡剛先生的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「犧牲」，在這中間，顧先生要大家爲民族解放而犧牲，爲種族這個「大我」的生存而犧牲個人的「小我」，道在目前確是非常正確的主張。不過，據我看來，由於敵人的不斷進攻，中國各種人羣自身的利害與整個民族的利害已或多或少地趨於一致了，因此我們不僅應喚起國民犧牲個人而爲民族，而且還應喚醒他們起來救自己；救國和救己在目前是一個課題，並不衝突，我們應該一致起來救國和自救；這樣去喚醒一般國民，將會獲得更大的效果。同時，顧先生在文章的起首還說：「維持自己的生存，保有自己的私產，乃是人類兩個基本的欲求，是人人都有的。人的生存，進化，發達諸現象，莫不是山這兩種欲望演繹和昇華而來」。我們以爲這不能成爲一般的絕對論斷，因爲在歷史的發展過程的某一階段中，人類並沒有「私產」，因之也無私有欲求；事實上，現在世界上不是已有無私有欲求的國家嗎？却誰也不能說那國家是不「進化」的。因此，顧先生的主張在目前的中國雖是不錯，但其理論的基本論點却還有值得研究的地方呢。</p>
<p>時事許論有兩篇：卽「中日的長期交涉」和「羅斯福連任美總統。前者的見解我們沒有不同的地方，可以略而不談。至於後者，則僅說明了藍敦之「思想守舊」和其接近廉姆克柯林的聯合黨是其失敗的原因，僅表面地介紹了羅氏所施行的一般政策，並未更深刻地指出美國共和黨和民主黨所代表的人羣，以及它們在選舉競爭中所施行的政策之本質；同時，羅氏連任總統後對於美國和世界之影響，該文也沒有一點分析。嚴格說來，這是非常不够的。</p>
<p>「大衆知識」的主要特點之一，是喜歡刊載古人的傳記。他們的用意，無非是在藉着某些古人之爲人和其生活的冉描寫來敎訓今人，這當然沒有可以非難的地方。但我們再行描寫古人時，不僅要述說他們的家庭環境和私生活，而且更應該由其社會環境來說明其一切表現，因爲這樣才可以使讀者對於古人和歷史有更深刻的了解，可以使他們受到更有力的敎訓。但該刊却不是這樣的。例如，這期鄭侃嬨先生的「王安石」，便是僅就王安石的家庭環境和其天性來說明其成就，並簡單地將安石的失敗原因歸之於他的「不辱己」，「善自守」，「不與人合作」，這可說完全是個人主義的說法。我們試問：假使王氏生於商周時代，能「實行變法」嗎？假使宋代的商業資本已戰勝封建地主，那安石的「不辱己」，「善自守」，「不與人合作」，還有可以非難的地方嗎？這恐怕是該文作者難於回答的吧。又如王崇武先生的一訶額侖」（成吉思汗鐵木眞的母親），也是簡單地將鐵木眞的功業歸於他的母敎的。看作者的用意，是要現在作母親的去學訶額侖，給我們敎幾個鐵木眞出來，這也不能說不對，但要我們靠母敎來復興民族，要婦女們都去作訶額侖，那便是把主題太誇大了，誇大得成爲錯誤了。</p>
<p>沈從文先生的「文學界聯合戰綫所有的意義」，一面要人「寬容」，另一面却牢訊着歷史，說那個過去如何，這個過去怎樣，似乎有點欠公平，雖然沈先生的基本立塲是與大家一致的。呂者邑先生的小說「眼睛」，是一篇富有民族解放意識的作品，只是在描寫的技術方面還不能說精細；某些地方甚至是在「開快車」似的。田濤先生的小說，熱」，更是一篇還未成熟的創作；不僅內容意識缺少積極意義，就是文字的結構，故事的組織，也都很不嚴密。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望人們對這個批評認爲是好意的，更希望「大衆知識」能不斷充實內容，繼續改善，成爲一種很進步的刊物。我們也愛讀「大衆知識」的某些文字和理論，因之提出了如上的意見，希望顧先生能把牠編得更好一點。</p>

<h3 id="c186">理髮的詛咒 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 裴銘</p>
<p>我可假定說，每一個有見識的人，都會同意於我說的在人的一生中最最可憎惡的事是理髮這句話的。每一個禮拜，或是最多兩個禮拜，你得去受這種幾乎規定的刑罰，你在道所謂文明的世界上活多麼久，遭刑罰就得受多麼久。當然，居的野人那麼長，可是在這摩登的時代裏，每件東西必須「流綫型」，維持着流行的式樣，你便不得不對自己的尊容略加考慮。爲了這一點，一個人便有了羨慕印度塞克敎徒的聰敏的理由，他們把紊亂的頭髮一古腦兒藏在他們的顏色頭布之下，讓鬍鬚把他們的臉龐弄得醜陋不堪，而不以每星期的理髮和每天的剃鬚來麻煩自己。道樣，也不知可節省多少的時間和麻煩，而我們是否應學他們的榜樣呢？</p>
<p>我恨上理髮店。第一·你必得等着，等輪到給　剪，綠於一家好的理髮店是常常擠滿了顧客的，有時，這樣的等待也許會繼續至半小時之久。於是，當輪到你時，你必須不能動彈地坐在一隻特別的椅干上（這種椅子的打樣設計，爲理髮匠的便利大而爲顧客的舒適小），其時間的久暫自半小時以至一小時不等，全以理髮匠的手腕如何爲標準。在這時間中，你的一切自由全失了，你不得不伏伏貼貼地，迅速地順從了他的命令，而把你的頭轉向這邊，轉向那邊，有許多時候甚至要適合他的任意擺佈。</p>
<p>理髮匠好像大半不是好心腸，他們剪你的髮，剃你的面，就像削山芋皮一般的漫不經心，他們用大力捉住了你的頭，像是恐怕你要從他手裏溜走般的，他們用這麼多的花巧來使用剪刀和剃刀，使你一見之下，不禁寒戰起來，他們還頻頻地搖動你的頭，還沒剪好一半，你便嬰頭昏目眩了；然而你只得毫無抗訴地屈受這種痛苦，爲了恐怕觸動了怒氣的理髮匠當眞要故意地加害於你高貴的頭上。</p>
<p>除了毫無半點行動自由地被縛在椅子上和你所受的許多苦痛之外，同時，你還有理髮匠所使用的剪刀剃刀在你的臉上割去什麼甫西的恐懼。這種恐懼並非全無根據的，因爲總不能豫期理髮匠一天到晚都頭腦淸晰的，他也許貪杯多飲了些酒，或是在工作時耽溺於白日之夢的享樂裏，或是對於他的單調的理髮工作已失去了興趣和注意，在這些情形之中的任何一種都能使他忘了手裏的工作和你的頭顏的神聖。因此，我每一决在離理髮店之前，總很細心地緊緊地把頭靠在鏡子前檢點一下，爲了要在付錢前確知是否失了什麼東西沒有</p>
<p>聽說有一個有名的將軍，當他理髮時，常有四個衛兵握着手鎗保護他，爲了恐怕理髮匠跟他的政敵串通了，只消一動那鋒利的剃刀，便割斷了他的喉管。此外，我們也聽說，這位將軍每决要理髮時，常挑選一個新理髮匠，而他的政敵便沒有藉理髮匠以行刺他的機會了。這個例証表示一位將軍在理髮時應該怎樣的豫防。無疑地，我們平民可不必以爲有人要串通理髮匠來謀害我們而自尋煩惱，可是我們依然不能泰然處之，因爲誰能說理髮匠不致於一不留意，在你臉上割掉了些東西呢？</p>
<p>我時常想，假如能發明一種機器，這種機器能用自己的手在五分鐘之內把目己的頭髮剪成任何式樣，那麼，它對於人類將有多大的利益呀。我們正在講節省時間和精力，我奇怪爲什麼一個人不把他的天才應用在節省時間和精力的理髮機器的發明上呢。鑒於不時發明繁雜的機器的事實，我不相信要發明這種理髮機器是全然不可能的。有些發明確實會改良人們的運命，可是，假如我們仍得不多時便要受理髮的刑罰，那我們就依然不能四我們的生命是快樂的生命。</p>
<p>有人主張說，理髮時候是最適宜於引起你各種最快樂的想像的時候，因爲在這時候，沒有人會來紛亂和阻止你思想的路綫的。這種主張我會試過多决，可是發覺裏面的氛圍氣大不適合於想像起什麼來；當剪刀和剃刀在你臉上滿臉舞過時，所引起的只是些可怖的思想；當你的心罹了恐怖，你自然而然地也不能想起任何甜蜜和快樂的事情來了。</p>
<p>又有人提議說，你專心一志地看些小報上的桃色新聞，便能减少理髮的厭惡。無疑的這是個好提議，可是像我眼光不健全的人，不戴眼鏡幾乎什麼都不能讀，而每逢我理髮時，理髮匠在動手之前又總堅持着要脫下我的眼鏡。</p>
<p>也有人提議說，當理髮匠在給你理髮時，你可以閉上眼睛打一個瞌睡；眞的，慣常看見有少許顧客在理髮店裏打瞌睡。我雖然也非常喜歡打瞌睡，然而我不敢把我的頭全然委託給理髮匠當心；我寧可淸醒着，這樣，假如在我頭上出了任何毛病，卽可不致於不注意地便過去。除此之外，瞌睡是有傳染性的，假如我打瞌睡，理髮匠也不能抵抗我的傳　影響，那你就可以很容易地想像到怎樣一個可怖的結果了。再說，目下的理髮店是男顧客和女顧客都有的，理髮匠不是個沒有情感的人，當他在給你剪髮時，也許時常把視綫投向你那美麗的鄰座人以飽他饑餓的眼睛，在這種情况之下，你頭顱的危險就雙倍的增加了。所以，我認爲在理髮店裏不打瞌睡是旣謹愼，又聰明的。</p>
<p>悲歎了許多理髮的不便利和痛苦，有時我對禿頭的人沒有別的辦法，只有嫉妬地瞧着他。然而，奇怪，當一個人發覺他的頭髮稀薄了，他便立刻往藥房裏去買一瓶有助頭髮生長之功的藥水，好像禿頭是一個人生命中的大不幸似的。若果禿頭果眞是一個人容貌上的妨害的話，那麼，我想，禿頭的人們至少已具有一種安慰，因爲他們是用不着像旁人一般的時常理髮而自尋煩惱了。</p>

<h3 id="c187">「賽金花」觀後感 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 癲</p>
<p>「賽金花」是演出了，可是直到現在還沒有人給它下一正確的估價。有人說：這齣劇失了主題：又有人說：這齣劇竟出現了兩個主題；脚本作行自己說：這是「歷史的諷喻劇」。—這卽是說：作者表明他寫這劇本底態度，所着眼的幷不是劇中底主題，而不過是把歷史上底故事摘露出來，針對着現實來加以「諷喻」罷了。</p>
<p>觀眾看　「賽金花」之後，都有種熱</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>辣辣的感覺，這種「感覺」倒不是劇中底形象正面的刺戟，而是好像在默默中有一種啟示似的。所以「賽金花」這劇，不管它本身有什麼缺點，如主題不顧明，性格不具體化，組織散漫，演技不熟練等，但只因爲這劇所要表現的「主題」不遇是被假借了來，對於現實加以發抒與諷喻而已，因此，劇底本身是失敗了，可是，它所要執行的任務却達到了，成功了。</p>
<p>「賽金花」這劇的缺點除了以上被人指出了之外，主要的是「劇辭」脫離了「劇情」，但因爲脚本底作者不過是「借題發揮」而已，所以，這劇底成功，正是由於幾段脫離了劇情的劇辭而造成的。默默中能給與觀衆一種啟示的也就是這幾段脫離了劇情的劇辭。因此，這劇底缺點反成了這劇底優點，這劇底失敗處也就是這劇底成功處。</p>
<p>「賽金花」底本事不過是寫一個名妓底悲歡離合的身世，中間又好像替這位「老運不通」的賽金花說了幾句不平的話。可是，我們若是抱這種觀念去看「賽金花」，無疑地會使你感到失望的。因爲這劇中認爲「主角」的賽金花，幷未能很細緻的把這一人物底生活，個性以及關於她的各方面都表現出來；充其量也不過是對這一人物的草率的速寫而已。同樣，你若把「賽金花」富作史劇來看，也不會使你得到滿意的答覆的，因爲其中所穿揷的史實，也不過是一些「稗官野史」而已。又如果你把「賽金花」當作諷刺劇來看，那當然更會使你得不到什麼，因爲用近代底觀點對前一世紀底故事的諷刺，那就等於對死人講道理了。所以，你看「賽金花」决不要忘了脚本作者夏衍底話：這是「諷喻劇」。因爲你若是忘了「諷昔」「喻今」的這一意義，一定會使你感到空虛與失望的。</p>
<p>我們今日所處的危難時代，實不亞於「八國聯軍破北京」的那一時代。今日住在北平天橋的賽金花，和三十六年前住在西太后底寢宮的賽金花，一樣看到了「洋兵」在北平的威風與橫行她卽使想「做一個太平仳界的老百姓」（劇中賽金花語），這一願望，賽金花今生也達不到了。賽金花底悲哀正提示了我們今日的危難。</p>
<p>在一個民族生死存亡緊急關頭的時候，一個被斥爲「下九流」的妓女尚且具有國家思想，竟能泯除私見（不管她用的是什麼手段），把一個普通人所不能解决的問題都解决了。今日的漢奸實不如這個失意的妓女，作者底諷喻是有力量的。</p>
<p>這些死的過去故事，無一不是針對着今日的活的現實。我們說：賽金花這劇的確是具有了兩個主題：一個是劇中底具體主題，一個是側面的抽象主題。它這種表現法必然地會影響到戲劇上底技巧，使觀衆不能得到統一的明確的瞭解，但環境才是阻碍藝術進步的罪人。「賽金花」雖然不能很明確地大胆地說明現在這一時代，可是，它底「諷喻」的確給了觀衆很大的刺戟與衝動。</p>
<p>「賽金花」底演出同時又告訴了我們目前的中國藝術界底苦悶：他們由於現實底刺戟，從藝術之宮衝到了十字街頭，他們有許多要說的話，但因爲種種原因，都不能說出來，只好梗在喉嚨里。可是，他們知道危難的時代就要到來了，不能緘默着，只能化裝出來「借題發揮」。這種「轉灣」的辦法無疑地會使他們對於藝術本身犯了不忠實的毛病；造成「賽金花」底主要缺點的，正是這種「轉灣」的結果。在過去每一個動亂的時代，藝術底進步必然地會遇到這種阻碍力，可是從藝術界本身看來，今日的苦悶的象徵却也就是未來的光明的前奏。</p>
<p>這種苦悶的象徵可說是今日藝術界底一般現象。像「賽金花」劇這樣「諷喻」的表現技巧，正是這種苦悶中的產物。如果我們能充分地利用着這種諷喻的技巧，衝出苦悶的氛圍氣，對於中華民族解放工作上，却也未嘗不是一種很重大的帮助呢。</p>

<h3 id="c188">小花園的女鞋業 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 卞北辰</p>
<p>我相信旅居在上海的朋友們，至少他們對於小花園的女鞋店總有點知道的吧？</p>
<p>其實，小花園女鞋店之使上海朋友有這麼一個鮮明的認識，倒不是由於牠專賣女人的鞋子，而是因牠開得太多，令人不得不對牠加以注意的緣故。</p>
<p>不過自從女鞋店在小花園開天闢地以來，也祗有三十幾年的歷史。最初開設的一家呌泰源祥，以後灣起的有大祿。陞泰昌·皇后等三家，可是截至現在爲止，小花園浙江路廣西路一帶的女鞋店已不下三五十爿了！</p>
<p>牠們營業的對象在滬戰前是以書寓內的妓女，滬戰後書寓失敗，舞塲勃興，則以舞女爲對象，此外是中上階級的太太小姐們，因爲她們愛的是漂亮，一雙鞋子給她們穿上，至多半個月就認爲不能再穿了。至於中下階級的婦女們呢？她們是沒有資格光顧的！卽使因某種原因而光顧了一次，自然，她們也是捨不得穿的，往往一雙鞋子要穿一年多，所以不論老闆或夥計，對於此類顧客到他的店內來惠顧時，總不見得表示怎樣的歡迎。</p>
<p>滬戰前的小花園女鞋店正值黃金時代，滬戰結束後簡直是到了沒落時代了。現在我先把滬戰前的女鞋店內的情形來說明一下：</p>
<p>雙開間女鞋店生意較好的平均每日營業三四百元，醜的一二百元；單開間生意好的也有百數十元，醜的七八十元。賣出去的鞋子價錢不一律，以店的大小作爲標準，頭等的女鞋店緞子繡花鞋大概每雙二元四角，二等的二元二角，三等的二元。高跟皮鞋最低價格六七元，最高十餘元。冷天女人穿的一元三四角本錢的毡呢煖鞋，要賣到四元。總計鞋子平均下來，項少要合着四分利，假定這家女鞋店每天營業數目是二百元的話，那末每天除去開支便有五十元可賺，由於賺錢太容易的緣故，小花園的女鞋店便逐漸增多了。</p>
<p>滬戰結束後女鞋店的失收，自然是受的不景氣的影響。繡花緞子鞋由二元四角跌至一元（雖然成本較前略輕，但究屬相差過鉅），有些店家九角已賣，祗有角把錢好賺：高跟鞋賣掉一雙，反要蝕兩元的本，毡呢鞋子也祗有三四角錢好賺。不過這還是鞋子做好了就賣出的話，假使鞋子在店裏擱了些時，樣子不合時，對折出售也很少有人來購買的。</p>
<p>每爿女鞋店內女鞋式樣大的有百餘種，每種又有大小尺寸七八種，每種尺寸四五雙，那末每爿店的有女鞋四五千雙至萬餘雙：假定每雙是一元，那未一爿店的資本是四五千元或萬餘元。可是現在的世界是一個摩登的世界啊，也許這個月認爲新的東西到下個月就不合時，因此，女鞋商們不敢把各種式樣的鞋儘量製造，恐怕賣不完不合時就要賠本，可是結果反使顧客要某種式樣的鞋子時，而以缺貨對，所以小花園的女鞋業就在這種情形下失敗了！</p>
<p>與女鞋商有唇齒相依的關係的女鞋店內的夥計，目前生活是更形困苦了—他們的待遇，除去工錢外，賣掉一雙鞋子是有一分大洋的扣頭的，從前一個夥計統扯每月有十元左右的扣頭，而現在有時連兩三元也弄不到手了！同時各鞋店爲了節省開支，實行裁員减薪，他們是正在天天愁着失業呢！</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>從前女鞋店營業鼎盛時代，鞋店夥計們樣子是怪高傲的，連顧客已走到店堂內，他們都還沒有起立，現在是祗要過路人略微在橱窗內張望一下，便出來招呼了，這情形是够悽慘的！</p>
<p>目能，有許多已停止營業的女鞋店，門上都交又着法院的封條。前幾天筆者偶爾經過小花園，發現以前在小花園開天闢地的泰源祥也倒閉了，歸家後腦海里便泛起一陣了思潮！「上海灘也許眞的要坍了吧？」</p>

<h3 id="c189">太平洋上的暹邏 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 何光銳</p>
<p>暹邏原是亞洲的一個較古的國家。三國時代卽與中國通往來；隋唐以後，更爲我國藩屬；明代復爲鄭和征服，華僑因而得在這裏任官職；淸代會爲緬甸所滅，後華鄭昭復國，稱暹邏王。就這段史實看來，可見暹羅與我國關係之深切了。但至淸光緒年間，英法帝國主義勢力侵入暹羅，掠奪其土地，將其國境劃分成兩大勢力範圍；從此以後，不僅暹羅與中國的那種深切關係宣吿斷絕，就是住在暹羅境內的中國僑胞也常遭到無理的壓迫和排斥；同時，暹羅在英法兩虎爭奪之下，雖得苟延生命，未被滅亡，在表面上還能維持獨立王國」的招牌，但在實際上却早已變成了半殖民地，成爲列强在太平洋上鬬爭的主要塲所之一。現在，由於世界危機的發展，殖民地再分害問題的日益嚴重，作爲半殖民地的暹維，當然更是列强在太平洋的爭覇戰中所注意的地方了。</p>
<p>在暹羅勢力最大的要算英國。拿經濟來說，英國資本在這裏實佔着主要的壟斷地位。無論貿易，銀行，鐵道以及其他資本主義的企業，可說全在英國的掌握中。爲了更具體地理解問題，我們且看在恐慌期中的一九三一和三二年的英國和暹羅的貿易概况吧（單位太加爾，十一太加爾爲一鎊）——</p>
<p>依據這個事實，可見英國在暹邏貿易中是佔着絕對的支配地位的。暹羅的主要生產品是米和柚木與錫，但這些東西大半都爲英國所吸收，就中榖物輸往英國者要佔百分之六十六，柚木輸往英國者要估百分之五十。在一九三一和三二年間，還羅向海外輸出一千一百二十九萬三千五百六十三太加爾的白銀，但就中卽有一千十七萬九千七百七十二太加爾是輸往英國的。這樣，我們可說整個暹羅的經濟生活都已握在英國的手中了。至於在政治方面，英帝國主議對暹羅也有極大的支配力量；它不僅藉經濟力量左右暹羅的政治，而且還可以直接由印度香港和新加坡策動一切。</p>
<p>可是，近年以來，英國在暹羅遇到了新的勁敵，那便是遠東的日本。在大陸和海洋政策下，日本一面猛烈向西北前進，在中國這塊大陸上來找尋它的「出路」；另一面則利用台灣和南洋委任統治地爲基礎，向南發展。於是，南洋和中國的福建廣東便都成爲了日本活動的區域；暹羅是太平洋上的重要地帶，而且是還未被某「帝國主義所獨呑的半殖民地，這當然更是日本海洋政策的行使者所注意的。在這個注意之下，首先表現出的，是日本廉價商品向暹羅的傾銷；據統計，在去年一年間，日本輸入暹羅的貨物共值四千萬日元，以購買力非常薄弱的小國暹羅，竟銷售了這樣多的日貨，眞不能不令人發生驚異。同時，暹羅出產的棉花亦大半爲日本所購買，使美國輸出到遠東的棉花大受影響。不過，在日本積極向暹羅進攻中，特別引人注意的，卽日本在暹羅取得了開鑿克拉運河的特權。</p>
<p>展開暹羅地圖來看，便可見到在下暹羅蘇辣省有一個狹小的地映，它位於南海和印度洋之間，西臨孟加灣，東接暹羅灣，隨馬來半島而下便是英國在太平洋上的經濟和軍事要地新加坡，如果這地方能够通航，實是歐亞交通必經的要道。現在因克拉運河還未開鑿，由歐洲開來的船隻必要繞道新加坡；假使克拉運河鑿成，那孟加灣與暹羅繼便可直接通航，使太平洋與印度洋的航程得縮短三日，因而便會使新加坡成爲廢港，克拉亦將代之而成爲歐亞的交通要道。同時，克拉運河鑿成後，日本更可在這裏建立新的軍事根據地，以虎視美之菲律賓，英之新加坡和香港以及印廣緬甸等地，使英美在太平洋上都受到嚴重的威脅。因此，當日本獲得開　克拉運河特權的消息傳出後，倫敎人士卽大爲震動，保守黨議員萊德在下院說道：「暹羅開堅克拉運河的事，必須與以大大的注意，因爲日本參加這個事業，給與經濟上的援助」。可見英國是如何地重視這個問題了。</p>
<p>同時，日本在這羅的政治活動也非常積極。它在這羅不僅呌出了「驅逐白槐人的壓迫」，「黃色人種解放」以及什麼「東洋的王道樂土」等口號以對付英國，而且還在那裏施行其慣計，組織「親日」的團體，以圖更進一步地在這羅發展其力量。</p>
<p>如果日本是英國在暹羅遇到的新的勁敵，那麼，法國便可說是它的舊的敵人了。我們已經知道，最先侵入暹羅的便是英法兩國，因而最先在還羅鬥爭的也就是它們。再從地理上來看，便更可見到在暹羅的東面是法領安南，西北是英領緬甸，南面接連下暹羅的則是英領馬來；換言之，卽是暹羅是在英法兩大勢力的包圍中；也就是說英法勢力在暹羅表現出了不可調和的對抗。現在，法國雖然因爲歐洲局勢緊張，不能以大的力量來對付東方，但對於暹羅仍是未曾忽視的；同時，倫敦方面也未會放鬆對於它的注意。過去暹羅國王會訪問安南，向法國特別表示好感，這便引起了英國很大的疑心；因之，在國王回到暹羅後，英國卽策動暹羅國內的親英份子，保護和擴大它在暹羅的權利。單是這件事情，就可以表明英法在暹羅勾心鬥角的一般情勢了。</p>
<p>英帝國主義本來在中國的商品販賣和原料市塲上已遭到了日本的嚴重打擊，在遠東的貨幣戰爭中更爲美國所壓倒，現在它之還能在太平洋上佔重要地位的，是因爲香港和新加坡在經濟政治和軍事方面的重要性還未失去。但是，暹羅與新加坡和香港有很密切的關係，如果它在暹羅的權利爲日本所奪取，那新加坡就會成爲廢港，香港的安全也就無法保持，因而英帝國主義便有被逐出於太平洋之外的危險。所以，英國在太平洋的爭覇戰中，對於暹羅非常重視；它一面積極强化新加坡軍港，準備太平洋問題的「最後解决」—武裝解决，另一面更努力使曼谷（暹羅首都）政府完全聽從倫敦的支配，以阻止日本乃至法國勢力的發展。但在事實上，暹羅近來的親日傾向却很濃厚，這是老大英國所大感不安的。</p>
<p>在另一方面，由於列强的加緊進攻，不僅暹羅國家日益失掉獨立的地位，卽暹羅八民的生活也在日益窮化中。因此，目前暹羅一般民衆的反帝和反其代理人的情緒非常高漲，動亂不安的現象幾乎隨處都可看到。爲了這個，暹羅國王曾特別訪問英領馬來和法領安南，締結政治經濟的互惠協定，以努力平定國內的反抗運動。</p>
<p>現在暹羅的命運有二：不是作列强太平洋爭覇的戰禍，便是民族解放運動成功，國家獨立。但不管怎樣，只要暹羅現狀一發生變化，太平洋形勢也要爲之一變的。</p>

<h3 id="c190">為橘子忙 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 麟</p>
<p>二十年前，我鄉外貌還是一個土老見的樣子，沒有馬路，沒有汽車，更沒有要人和他如雲的隨從們來遨遊，所以秋季一完，街頭巷尾差不多都是橘子攤。說起這橘子攤，眞可當作一種美術品來看：一塊長長的板，靠着闊入住宅的雪白的高牆，板上堆着朱砂一般鮮紅的橘子。這些橘子的堆法，不像上海水菓店那樣千家一律似的，用木箱裝得整整齊齊，顯得非常平板。它們的堆法要看攤子的大小：大的，往往堆成名山奇峯，層巒起伏，怪石嵯峨，看上去，似乎有萬山奔騰，驚石迸裂的樣子：小的，則堆作秀麗的亭閣，精緻的寳塔等等。到了晚上，這些山峯上，寳塔上都點上了一盞一盞小小的橘子燈，遠遠望去，粉壁牆上映着微微的紅光，光影下映出了起伏無定的朱赤的一片。夜深了，微風吹來，燈影搖曳，好像是這些微弱的燈火，聽着遠地的犬吠，有些怔忡似的</p>
<p>橘子燈也和攤的陳設一樣，要靠着賣橘者的聰明和技巧。有的燈眞是做得精緻：他們選擇那形狀最好，顏色最紅的橘子，將頂上挖一小洞，設法把內裏的果肉一點一點取出來，只剩下整個的毫無破損的橘殼，再將這殼用刀彫出各種圖案的孔，有時還將一小片，一小片的皮翻起，顯出裏面淺實的裏皮，然後才灌入半效菜油，用小錢壓上二三莖燈草，點起來便成了一盞非常美麗的橘子燈。</p>
<p>我鄉的橘子，非到橘皮紅透不賣，所以沒有上海橘子初出時，水菜店主人那種以爲奇貨可居，拚命「敲竹槓」的可怕樣子。到橘皮紅透時，橘子的產量自然已是大有可觀的了，那時江上飄飄而來的，幾乎全是橘子船。人口繁，小孩多的人家，往往直接在河邊去向船戶買，不計個數，只論多少錢一挑（卽一担），買回家來，大人小孩總是吃得連飯都吃不下。在這橘子滿市的時侯果肉是不值錢的，值錢的是橘皮，橘核和果肉上附着的筋，據說這三種東西都可以作藥，是我鄉每年的大宗出口貨。所以，假如你買十個橘子，把果肉吃了，再將橘皮拿到橘子攤上去，還可換回八個或九個無皮無筋的橘肉來：若不願意掉換橘肉，賣成現金也是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>橘子的產量是跟着冬的氣候而增進的：越冷，市上的橘子越多，從頭年秋末起，一直要到明年仲春，才會逐漸少下來。所以過年的時候，每戶人家在祖宗或家神的像前，除了供三牲九品之外，再便是一盤重重疊疊的大紅橘子和一盤鵝黃色的橙子（卽文旦）。有孩子們來拜年的，除了賞給長生果，糖食，現錢外，也給幾個上選的橘子。橘子，因了有這大量的出產，所以大家總是想方設法地來消耗它，除了上述的幾種消耗之外，大家還把它作成「橘羹」，榨成「橘餅」，製成「橘糕」。橘羹說是可以醒酒，橘餅能治肺癆，橘糕能够「順氣」，專治胃疼。究竟有這些功効沒有，我沒有實騐過，不通中國入無論作什麼事，總是要找一個正大光明的借口的。此外，如果患咳嗽了，便把橘子頂上挖一窟窿，灌入少許麻油，拿到火上去烤，等橘度烤焦，果肉全給麻油滲透了，才剝出來吃。據說這也是很好的「單方」。</p>
<p>我鄉共有七十幾縣，幾乎每縣都產橘子，大的是全省的氣候，土壤都差不多的緣故。一個橘園往往佔地二三百里，聽說無論何人，要到園內去遊玩觀賞，都非常自由，决不受任何限制，因爲照園內的規矩，是准許遊客採食的，只是不能帶走。這比之默洲各國法律明定了果園主人，得以槍打死採食果實的過客來，眞有大家小戶之分了！在我鄉還有凡是伸出園牆外的橘子，卽使過客要摘下帶走，園主也不能加以干涉的。</p>
<p>橘子的種植很簡單，只要氣候和土壤適宜，放下種子（卽橘核）去總是能够生長起來的。可是從放入種子到產出果子，中間却需要很長的時間，故我鄉有諺云：「桃三，李四，柑八年」。總之橘子是溫帶的產物，氣候越溫和便成長得越快，果實的質也越好。在意大利等國，三五年就可望橘樹結果，而所產的果子，比起我鄉的來，又甘美得多了。</p>
<p>二十年前，一到冬天，我們便為橘子忙，製燈，壓餅，熬糖，沒有半刻安寗。二十年後的今年冬天，我回家去，已看不見絲毫的這種現象了，街道上已有了上海式的水果店，而店中所賣的竟也是大箱的「烟台蘋果」，「花旗橘子」，「暹羅文旦」，「美國葡萄」……了！我鄉土產的橘子也和在上海的水果店裏一樣，和那些不受人歡迎的山薯片，蘿葡頭一起，擺在店前的小攤上了！要單獨看見橘子，除非在深夜嘶着喉嚨，沿街呌費的小販的手提籃裏，這是專賈給夜裏休息的勞動者，以解抽過鴉片烟後的焦</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Foreign Ministry Spokesman Talks About Not Allowing a Third Party to Infringe Upon Sovereignty. The Bandit Army's Invasion of Sui Should Be Severely Suppressed Regardless of Its Background. The Government Still Adheres to Its Consistent Policy of Suppressing Domestic Bandits Through Self-Reliance. In the Event of Illegal Infringement or Interference, We Will Defend with All Our Might. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the Meng Wei bandit army has launched a large-scale invasion of Sui, and the government has the responsibility to defend the territory and quell the chaos to ensure the people's safety. Regardless of their background or role, they should be severely suppressed. This is the act of any sovereign state, and no third party should criticize it. Since the deployment of troops, we have been winning victories. The annihilation of the bandit army is not far off. As for the domestic communists, they have been dealt heavy blows by the national army over the years and are on the verge of collapse. The government still adheres to its consistent policy of suppressing the remaining bandits through self-reliance, continuing its efforts to completely eliminate them. The determination and achievements of our government to curb communism are known to the world and cannot be confused by false propaganda. The Chinese people love peace, and our government adheres to the policy of self-preservation and coexistence, fostering good relations with neighboring countries and adjusting international relations to contribute to world peace. However, the integrity of territorial sovereignty is a necessary condition for national survival and cannot be infringed upon or interfered with by any third party under any pretext. In the unfortunate event of such illegal infringement or interference, we will defend with all our might to fulfill the responsibilities of the state. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops in Chifeng and Chengde are Prepared for Emergency Deployment. An Important Decision Was Made at the Changchun Conference. Chen Cheng Arrived in Sui to Confer with Fu Zuoyi and Others. The Bandits Changed Their Plans to Disturb Eastern Sui. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reliable sources, the Kwantung Army headquarters in Changchun held an important meeting on the Sui situation at 1:00 PM on the 28th. The commanders of the 174th and other divisions participated and listened to Itagaki's report on the negotiations in Tianjin for specific decisions. Japanese troops between Chifeng and Chengde are prepared for emergency deployment. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kwantung Army headquarters has issued a statement on the Sui situation, claiming that they cannot ignore the war in that area for the sake of preventing communism and ensuring the safety of the Japanese-Manchu border. Japan and "Manchukuo" will take decisive action for self-defense. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Kwantung Army, Etc. Issued an Announcement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Changchun) Today, the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Kwantung Army jointly issued an announcement here. According to the announcement, if the situation in Suiyuan endangers the peace and order of "Manchukuo," the Japanese and "Manchukuo" authorities will have to take appropriate measures to prevent trouble before it happens. The announcement detailed the reasons why the Japanese and "Manchu" armies sympathize with the Inner Mongolian army's attack on Sui, and mentioned that the Chinese government is still unwilling to cooperate with Japan to jointly fight communism. It continued that the Inner Mongolian army's operations in Suiyuan were due to the increasing oppression of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military groups closely related to the Communist Party, so they had to defend themselves in this way. The purpose of Inner Mongolia is always in line with the urgent national policies of Japan and "Manchukuo." The announcement concluded by saying, "The Japanese military authorities hope for the success of Inner Mongolia, so they cannot be indifferent to incidents that may harm the peace and order of Manchukuo or cause the Bolshevization of the whole of China." (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Suiyuan telegram: Chen Cheng's special train departed from Datong for Sui at noon on the 28th and is expected to arrive at midnight. He plans to stay at the Public Hospital. Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and Zhao Chengzhou are all preparing to welcome him. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: The puppet Mongolian army has begun to gather in the Shangdu Gubao area, and the puppet Rehe army is also gathering in that direction. Someone ordered Li Shouxin and Wang Ying to harass Taolin Xinghe within a week, and a supervisory team was formed, led by the puppet Jing'an army captain. Those who retreat will be executed on the spot. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The special agencies of a certain party in Alashan and Ejin Banner have all withdrawn, and the personnel have already gone to Tianjin via Baotou. Da Wang telegraphed Fu Zuoyi on the 27th, stating that the Alashan Banner is currently very peaceful. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) There were no changes in eastern and northern Sui on the 27th. Zhao Chengzhou and Wang Jingguo will stay in Sui for a short period, and Jingguo will also go to Baotou. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: The Suiyuan provincial government issued an order to all towns and counties in the province on the 28th, instructing the public not to panic when enemy planes come to drop bombs, but to dig underground holes to take refuge. It also instructed the county governments to instruct the public to do so. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The Bandits Abandoned the Plan to Counterattack Bailingmiao</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Zhangbei, a certain party believes that Bailingmiao is not easy to counterattack due to its terrain. It has now abandoned its plan and decided to use all its strength to invade Taolin Xinghe and Pingdiquan in eastern Sui. In recent days, puppet troops have been continuously concentrating in Chengde from Jinzhou and Sui via Weichang, and after arriving in Chengde, some remained in Chengde, and some continued to head west, seemingly to reinforce Shangdu. The puppet bandit army in the rear has recently received assistance from a certain party and has been constantly harassing Xinghe in recent days, but they have all been repelled by our army. Fu Zuoyi went to Pingdiquan this morning to inspect. After the national army recovered Bailingmiao, the bandit army suffered heavy losses. The bandit army, led by Li Shouxin and Wang Ying, is afraid that the national army will continue to advance, so it has deployed defenses in the Shangdu area. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>A Certain Party Sent Military Officers to Various Temples</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) A certain party and bandit puppet leaders have been secretly meeting in Jiabusi in recent days, claiming that they will never give up Bailingmiao and are reorganizing their main force to prepare for a counterattack. More than a hundred military officers from a certain party took five cars from Duolun to Jiabusi on the 26th, carrying various maps and registers. Residents of Chahar Province are extremely frightened by the current situation and are fleeing to the interior. Intelligence about bandits and puppets is reported to Changchun daily from Shangdu, Jiabusi, Zhangbei, and other places. The radio stations are guarded by people from a certain party. Wang Ying is currently in Shangdu, with more than 3,000 people. Wang and Yin Baoshan secretly met on the 26th night, but they almost broke up due to disagreements. A certain party has ordered Li Shouxin to monitor Wang and others to prevent any changes. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Ten Truckloads of Firearms Were Shipped to Shangdu for Replenishment</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) After the defeat of the bandit puppets at Honggeertu's Lingmiao, the wounded soldiers died in piles because no one cared for them, and also because of the severe cold in Chahar Province. The loss of new-style firearms was more than 3,000. On the 25th and 26th, ten trucks of new guns were transported from Zhangbei to Shangdu and distributed to various units. More than a thousand Rehe artillerymen stationed in Jiageying left for Shangdu on the morning of the 26th and are expected to arrive on the evening of the 27th. The rebellious leaders are determined to act recklessly and resist to the death in the Shangdu area. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The Sui Meng Conference Committee is Dissatisfied with De Wang</p>
<p>(Guihua) All members of the Sui Mongolian Political Conference telegraphed the central government and Supervisor Yan on the 27th, expressing their dissatisfaction with De Wang's behavior. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Zhao Pilian Talked About Urging Yun Wang to Return to the Temple</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian said that on the 28th, a telegram from the front continued to report that when the bandit planes bombed Bailingmiao, most of the lamas in the temple had already escaped, and there were few deaths. However, the houses in Bailingmiao were destroyed, and the losses were very heavy. Our army suffered slight casualties. The casualties and losses of local merchants are difficult to estimate. The bandit puppet army originally planned to bypass the Daqingshan and head west to invade the Alashan Banner of Ningxia. Now that our army has captured Bailingmiao, the bandit puppet army's route to the west has been cut off. Therefore, it is expected that there will still be fierce fighting in the Bailingmiao area. As for Yun Gan, who was originally stationed 60 miles near Bailingmiao, he has not yet replied after the Mongolian and Tibetan Association telegraphed him to urge him to return to the temple. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Kang Shiyi, the representative of the Sui provincial government, has arrived at the Yun Wang's residence in Darhan Banner to express condolences to Yun Shi. Yun Wang is very pleased that our army has driven the puppet troops out of the temple and relieved the suffering of the Mongolian people in the Wumeng League. He specially slaughtered hundreds of sheep to reward the army. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The Frontline Severely Needs Gas Masks, Etc.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to relevant sources, a large number of bandit troops are gathering in Zhangbei and Shangdu. Those coming from Duolun have been continuously arriving. Regular troops from a certain party are also interspersed among them. Civilian houses in Shangdu and Zhangbei have been occupied, and the people have been driven to the front lines to build fortifications. Our army learned from captured bandits that the bandit's target of attack is still in Honggeertu in eastern Sui. All supplementary weapons have been transported to the destination. In addition, there is a chemical warfare team and hundreds of boxes of poison gas bombs, all of which are prepared for use during the general invasion. The frontline currently needs gas masks urgently. Although a batch was transported a few days ago, the number is very small and still insufficient. It is hoped that the rear will step up manufacturing and procurement and transport them as soon as possible. The training of frontline people in common sense of gas defense is also being stepped up. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Wang Ying's Bandit Troops Division Commander Has Revolted</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to relevant sources, Wang Ying's bandit troops have been extremely disorganized internally since suffering repeated heavy blows. His basic team, Siyu Shan's brigade, has revolted in a certain place 60 miles north of Shangdu. It is said that the remaining troops will also rise up and follow suit. A certain party is extremely frightened and angry about Wang's instability. In addition to ordering Li Shouxin and other bandit troops to monitor them nearby, they have also urgently ordered the puppet troops of Zhang Hai Peng and others in Rehe to head west to coerce them. Currently, transportation between Zhangbei, Shangdu, and Jiabusi is busy. Once the military equipment is replenished, the bandit troops will make a second desperate attempt on Sui. According to those familiar with the inside story of Mongolian affairs, after the national army occupied Bailingmiao, De Wang's power is already gone by seventy or eighty percent. The kings and nobles of various leagues in Chahar and Mongolia have always been deeply influenced by the central government's virtue and are mostly inwardly oriented. In the future, they will never be used by others. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) In Shangdu, Zhangbei, and other places, local militias have risen up to block and seize Wang Ying's troops' weapons. The puppet troops of Wang and Li suffered a major attack and suffered no small losses. The special agency of a certain party in Alashan Banner was abolished after we recovered Bailingmiao, and the Japanese have all left the banner. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chief of Staff of the Japanese General Staff Arrived in Tianjin to Convey Orders Regarding the Sui Situation. Tashiro Convened a Meeting, and Sato Also Attended. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Colonel Ishihara, the chief of the operations section of the Japanese General Staff, came to Tianjin on the 28th at 6:00 AM on the Beining Railway train to convey orders regarding the Sui situation. He had previously participated in a meeting of division commanders of the Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria in Changchun. Hashimoto and Kazuki and others welcomed him at the station. At 2:00 PM, he met with Tashiro at the Haiguang Temple Command and convened a meeting immediately. The military staff below Hashimoto and Kazuki also participated. Lieutenant General Sato, who came to Tianjin on the 27th to convey the opinions of the military headquarters, also attended the meeting. Ishihara described the resolutions of the General Staff and the Changchun meeting. The discussion lasted until 4:00 PM and then adjourned. Ishihara will stay in Tianjin for a few days and fly to Shangdu and Zhangbei for inspection. He will then return to Changchun for further consultations before returning to his country to report. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kwantung Army and the North China Army have different views on the Sui situation. Colonel Ishihara's visit is not only to convey the intentions of the central department but also to communicate the opinions of the two armies. After decisive action, they will act in unison and solidify the front. The Tianjin Army Department in North China will accommodate the opinions of the Kwantung Army Department and will change its countermeasures. Ishihara is scheduled to go to Ping on the 29th to visit Kawabe, Matsumuro, and Imai before flying to Zhangbei and Shangdu for inspection. Tashiro hosted a reception at his official residence at 8:00 PM on the 28th. During the meeting, Hashimoto reported on the current situation in North China, and it was discussed. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The arrival of Ishihara, the chief of the First Section of the Japanese General Staff, is very noteworthy. He met with Tashiro and others on the afternoon of the 28th, and the meeting lasted for a long time. It is said that Ishihara is scheduled to return to Changchun on the 29th to meet with Ueda again before returning to his country to report on the opinions of the Kwantung Army and the Japanese army stationed in North China. The Japanese central department will then decide on its North China policy based on this report. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Italian-Japanese Agreement Officially Declared. Acknowledging the Development of the Puppet State's Economy. The League of Nations Does Not Pay Much Attention to It. American People Are Quite Dissatisfied. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) It has been officially announced that Italy and Japan have reached an agreement stipulating that Italy recognizes the puppet state of Manchuria, while Japan recognizes the Ethiopian Empire as Italian territory. In addition, the Italian-Japanese agreement also includes many commercial clauses. Italy does not currently intend to appoint an ambassador to the puppet state but will send a consul general to be stationed in Harbin. The Italian government has also requested the puppet state government to issue consular credentials. According to economists here, the exchange of recognition between Italy and Japan of the puppet state of Manchuria and the Italian Empire will have an extremely significant impact on the commerce of the two countries. (Havas dispatch, 28th) Well-informed sources acknowledge that the Italian and Japanese governments are currently holding talks, but these talks began before the signing of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern" Agreement and are therefore not related to the "Anti-Comintern" Agreement. It is also reported that the talks currently underway between Tokyo and Rome, while also including the matter of Japan's recognition of the Italian Empire, mainly concern economic matters. The purpose of these talks is not to sign an Italian-Japanese agreement similar to the German-Japanese agreement. According to well-informed sources, Italy does not believe that it is necessary to participate in the German-Japanese agreement at present, because Italy and Germany have already concluded an agreement. If Italy participates in the Anti-Comintern Agreement again, it would be redundant. Well-informed sources also believe that the outside world's expression of fear about the German-Japanese agreement is incomprehensible, because this agreement is purely a defensive pact that does not conflict with any international treaties, and its purpose is only to oppose the propaganda of the Comintern and is not related to Soviet Russia. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese government concluded the Anti-Comintern Agreement with Germany, it is now engaging in political understanding with Italy. Ambassador Sugimura, stationed in Italy, is continuing to negotiate with the Italian government. The opinions of Japan and Italy have been unified, and the two governments have decided to mutually recognize the fact of the independence of "Manchukuo" and the merger of Italy and Ethiopia. The Italian government further recognizes Japan's commercial interests in Ethiopia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to abolish the embassy in Ethiopia and re-establish a consulate in the capital of Ethiopia. The edict concerning the establishment of this new consulate, the amendment to the ordinance on the fixed number of staff in foreign embassies and consulates, and the amendment to the ordinance on its expenses have been submitted to the cabinet. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will withdraw the embassy in Ethiopia after the cabinet decides and will establish a new consulate. The large-scale period is mid-December. The Italian side is also setting up a consulate general in Changchun and submitting credentials to the "Manchukuo" government to recognize "Manchukuo." Japan has always maintained commercial interests in Ethiopia. Ambassador Sugimura and Foreign Minister Ciano are currently conducting preparatory talks, and Japan's rights will remain valid as before. (Allied Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the news that Italy and Japan concluded an agreement, with Japan recognizing Ethiopia in exchange for Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo," was released, there has been no expression of surprise in Berlin, Paris, and Geneva. The German side is extremely silent about this matter. Today, an official spokesman claimed that this agreement only concerns Italy and Japan. The French diplomatic community believes that this move by Italy and Japan has no practical benefit for either party except for the issue of prestige, especially for Italy, because after its great victory in East Africa, it has eliminated any threat from Japan's aggression against Ethiopia. Although there has been no formal announcement from Rome regarding this agreement, it is reported that the Italian consulate in Harbin will be established soon. It is also reported by some sources in Rome that Italy may allow Japan to have special access to raw materials in Ethiopia, such as planting cotton for use in the Japanese textile industry. Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo" obviously disregards the League of Nations, but Geneva does not pay much attention to the Italian-Japanese agreement. People there recognize Italy's actions as "another moral degradation," but some other countries have already recognized "Manchukuo" in fact, such as sending consuls general and trade inspection teams there, which are all examples. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the news that Italy and Japan are conducting negotiations to have Italy recognize "Manchukuo" and Japan recognize Italy's annexation of Ethiopia, semi-official circles here have expressed dissatisfaction after hearing the news. Well-informed sources, while not believing that this transfer of interests can be effective internationally, believe that it is enough to cause a dangerous situation for two reasons: (1) This move could encourage Italy and Japan to continue to pursue imperialist policies. (2) All countries that feel threatened by the dictator group of countries may fiercely resist. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Official sources here stated today after studying the German-Japanese agreement that the agreement will further increase the risk of war in Europe and Asia. The United States has already decided to take a bystander attitude toward the disputes in Europe and Asia and will only conduct academic research on the agreement to speculate on its impact on world peace.

<p>(Taiyuan) Jingwei telegraphed Yan and Fu from overseas to express condolences and appreciation. The telegram was forwarded by Chen Bijun and said that he was deeply saddened to learn of the bandit puppets' invasion of Sui while he was ill.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the situation in Southwest China has been broken and national political orders have been unified, the authorities are now determined to develop transportation in Southwest China in order to facilitate transportation and culture between provinces, and for the sake of consolidating national defense. It is also necessary for the transportation of the provinces to be connected as soon as possible. Therefore, with the completion of the Yuehan Railway, which runs through the central and southern arteries, a new era has begun in land transportation between the hinterland of the country and southern China. Recently, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have resumed the construction of roads and the development of civil aviation in order to complete the southwest transportation network. In Guangdong Province, the construction of the Huangpu branch of the Yuehan Railway is being actively carried out. At present, the first phase of the project from Xicun to Shipai has started, and the civil land, farmland, and cemeteries along the line have been purchased separately, and the earth and stone works are being intensified. The entire road is scheduled to be completed within six months. Initially, it was proposed that the Ministry of Railways order materials from foreign countries, but because it would take too long, the remaining rails and materials from the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section will be allocated for application to the earth and stone works, and the cement used for the earth and stone works will also be purchased from the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory nearby. In addition to the Huangpu branch, Guangdong Province is also proceeding with the construction of the Guangzhou-Meixian Railway, which runs directly from Guangzhou to Meixian in the eastern region (the rumor that the Guangzhou-Shantou Railway is actually a mistake). Personnel have been dispatched to survey the route, and the first phase of surveying work has been completed. We are now waiting for the authorities and the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to review the survey before construction can begin. As for Guangxi Province, in addition to the recent construction of the Guilin-Wuzhou Highway by the Corps of Engineers, the Guangxi authorities believe that the provincial capital of Guangxi has been relocated to Guilin, and transportation between northern Guangxi and southern Hunan should be developed urgently. Recently, the Guangxi government specially requested the Central Government to build a branch of the Yuehan Railway from Hengzhou to Guilin in order to prosper the Hunan-Guangxi border area, and requested that the Ministry of Railways send engineering personnel to conduct preliminary surveys. As for the Sanhe Railway, which is related to transportation between Guangdong and Guangxi, the matter has recently been brought up again. Because the transportation between Guangdong and Guangxi depends on the Xijiang River, navigation is difficult every winter when the water dries up. If it rains, navigation is dangerous due to the heavy floods in the west. If the Sanhe (from Sanshui, Guangdong to He County, Guangxi) Railway is completed, not only will the delays and obstacles to the usual water transportation between the two sides be eliminated, but it will also be of great benefit to the development of forests in Sihui and Guangning counties in Guangdong Province and the production of He County in Guangxi Province. It has been heard that the Guangxi Provincial Authorities have recently requested the Ministry of Railways for assistance in constructing the railway in order to complete the transportation between Guangdong and Guangxi. The above is the construction of land transportation in Guangdong and Guangxi. As for civil aviation, the Southwest Civil Aviation Company believes that the southwest air transportation has now reached the Guangdong-Guangxi air route, and connects with the Vietnamese French Civil Aviation. Although the Guangxi line has recently been rerouted to Liuzhou and Guilin, it has not yet been extended to Guizhou and Yunnan. In light of the current serious national crisis, in order to facilitate southwest transportation, it has been decided to take a further step to plan the Yunnan and Guizhou lines. One line runs from Nanning, Guangxi, through Baise and Mengzi, directly to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province. One line runs from Guilin through Liuzhou and Dushan to Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, to form a civil aviation transportation network between Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It has been heard that this move has been submitted by the Southwest Civil Aviation Company to the Ministry of Communications for approval and planning, and the line measurement and construction of airport stations can be carried out soon. Plans are also underway to raise funds to order new five-passenger civil aviation aircraft from the United States to operate the Yunnan and Guizhou air routes. (November 26)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Italy Recognizes the Puppet State of Manchukuo <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>At a time when the world is watching the development of the German-Japanese alliance with apprehension, foreign dispatches in recent days have reported that Japan and Italy have concluded an important agreement. Although this agreement differs from the military alliance between Japan and Germany, it will include a significant point: Japan will first recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia in exchange for Italy's recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo. The first step of this agreement, according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo reported yesterday, has already been confirmed. The main point is that Japan recognizes Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia, changing its embassy in Addis Ababa to a consulate. At the same time, Italy will open up commercial rights in Abyssinia to Japan as initial compensation. This resolution has already been submitted to the Japanese cabinet and is awaiting approval. After this first step is realized, Italy's recognition of the puppet Manchukuo will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Japan's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, in addition to violating international morality and disregarding the sovereignty of a weak nation, does not directly affect our interests. However, if Italy recognizes the puppet Manchukuo, it would simply be a disregard for our territorial sovereignty and an increase in the arrogance of those who are invading us. For the past five years, although China has not yet taken overall action to recover lost territories under the enemy's invasion and oppression, no one has been so insane as to express a willingness to abandon sovereignty over the four northeastern provinces. Therefore, we are extremely pleased with the United States' Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition, even if it is just an empty statement, and we welcome this expression of sympathy. We are extremely indignant and condemn the shameless collusion of El Salvador, a small and insignificant country, in recognizing the puppet state. Because of this, no other country has dared to risk universal condemnation and act as an echo for the aggressors in the Far East for several years. Now, if Italy actually does this, in addition to fundamentally not recognizing this private deal by the aggressors, we will further deepen our distrust of Italy's violation of morality.</p>
<p>However, judging from the situation, Italy's decision to recognize the puppet Manchukuo has probably reached the point of inevitable implementation. After Italy announced the annexation of Abyssinia this summer, there was a message saying that it would send an envoy to the East to reside in Manchuria as a de facto recognition of the puppet state. However, at that time, Italy's invasion of Abyssinia clearly lost the sympathy of people around the world, and Germany's signing of a commercial agreement with the puppet Manchukuo, which undermined Chinese sovereignty, was also criticized from all sides. As a result, Italy finally lost its courage and postponed the plan to recognize the puppet Manchukuo. However, during this period of postponement, a compromise between Germany and Italy was reached, and recently the German-Japanese alliance was also concluded. The remaining Japanese-Italian agreement is naturally also being actively promoted. The fundamental effect of the combination of these three fascist powers is, of course, to increase aggressive forces, and its direct impact is undoubtedly to sacrifice weak nations and attack peaceful forces. Now, although we want to try our best to stay out of it, in reality, the dignity of our territorial sovereignty will be the first to be disregarded.</p>
<p>It is said that the alliance agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy will be expanded as much as possible in the future, especially to "persuade" our country to join. Of course, we are a country under aggression and can never join the group of aggressors and willingly become a sacrifice. On the contrary, we must resist the threat of this aggressive group and actively befriend peaceful and friendly countries to free ourselves from the trap of the aggressors.</p>

<p>Valencia, Spain – The Republic of Spain, through Foreign Minister Alvarez, has sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, requesting that the Council of the League of Nations be convened in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant to consider "the situation in Spain caused by the interference of Germany and Italy in the Spanish Civil War, in violation of current international law, and in support of the rebels." The note stated, "Italy and Germany's recognition of the rebel authorities as the legitimate government of Spain is, in effect, an act of aggression against the Republic of Spain." It concluded by stating that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebels, has recently decided to use force to prevent the freedom of trade in ports under the control of the government, which may also lead to international disputes. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – It is now understood that the Council of the League of Nations may meet in London. The Chairman of the Council, Chilean representative Rivas Vicuña, is in Chile and will be replaced by the Chilean Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Eduardo. The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War is also currently meeting in London, so it would be convenient for the Council to consult with the Committee on all matters. It is reported that the Council meeting may be held on December 3rd. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – The Council of the League of Nations will probably convene an extraordinary meeting on December 3rd or 4th to discuss the note sent by the Spanish Foreign Minister Alvarez. League of Nations officials say that the Council meeting will be extremely difficult. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) – The Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom today went to the British Foreign Office to explain the views of his government on requesting the League of Nations to convene a Council meeting. According to the Spanish side, Spain is not asking the League of Nations for assistance, but only hopes that the League of Nations will consider the dangerous situation. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) – Regarding the Spanish government's request to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to consider the situation in Spain, those responsible have said that the British and French governments are currently exchanging views. In the United Kingdom, this is considered futile and regrettable. However, since the Spanish government has submitted an application, it cannot be refused. Therefore, the Council will convene a meeting in the near future. However, the British and French governments are currently considering how to ensure that the Council meeting does not cause major difficulties. In addition, it is reported that Italy has decided not to attend the Council meeting. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) – Regarding the Spanish Republican government's request to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, political figures here completely ignore it, saying that Italian newspapers had already anticipated this move after Germany and Italy recognized the Spanish Nationalist government. It is also said that the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, has repeatedly criticized the Soviet Union for violating the non-intervention agreement within the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, and the rights and wrongs are already clear. Although the Valencia government has applied to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, it is expected that it will have no practical effect because the League of Nations itself lacks authority. In addition, no one has mentioned whether Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations because of the Spanish affair. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Spanish Rebels Repeatedly Attack the Capital Without Success; Now Changing Tactics; The Defenders' Tactics Are Surprising; New Commander Appointed for the Northern District of the Capital <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Madrid – The Nationalist army's battle to seize Madrid has now lasted three weeks, and its position is worse than it was two weeks ago, according to general opinion. After another 24 hours of Nationalist attacks, they still cannot advance beyond the locations occupied during the first major offensive. Therefore, the longer the Nationalist army's occupation of Madrid is delayed, the more difficult it will become. So far, the government forces have been able to contain the Nationalist army's advance, and their tactics have surprised neutral observers. The capital's defensive works are being improved daily. It is said that six engineering battalions will be dedicated to building defensive works in the future. The people are extremely excited to hear this. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Special dispatch from our reporter: Madrid has been besieged for 22 days. The strategy adopted by the Nationalist army is to advance in a wedge formation, regardless of cost, in an attempt to break through the government forces' lines. So far, this can be said to have failed. The government forces are now organized and equipped with a large number of armaments, which are sufficient to cope with the situation. On the contrary, the Nationalist army's forces are clearly insufficient, and their rear guards have not been able to protect them completely. The reason why the government forces were able to depart from the southern suburb of Aranjuez and attack the city of Villavara to the southwest is because of this. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Talavera – Special dispatch from our reporter: General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, is planning to change tactics due to the repeated failures to capture Madrid. It is reported that General Franco is prepared to abandon both intensive bombing and strict encirclement tactics, and instead order each column to operate individually to occupy various districts within the city, including the ruins that have been destroyed by bombing. The idea is that after occupying one district, the entire city can be further divided into two. It is learned that General Franco originally intended to command his subordinates to charge on the entire front in an attempt to take it in one fell swoop, but changed his mind because the adoption of this tactic would inevitably result in a large number of casualties. In short, the Nationalist army's headquarters is not advocating recklessness at present and will wait for a favorable opportunity before launching an offensive. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The newly appointed front-line commander of the northern district of the capital, General Kléber, is a remarkable figure in the Spanish Revolution. Today, he declared to reporters that the rebels' attack on the capital has failed, and that they will have no hope of success in the future without the help of German Führer Hitler or Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid – General Kléber, who leads the International Brigades to assist the Spanish government forces in their operations, predicted today that the government forces could win a major victory around the end of this year. Kléber is of mixed French and German descent, became a Canadian citizen in middle age, and served in the European War. After the end of the European War, he joined the White Russian army. Kléber said that the Nationalist army has the advantage because of its sophisticated weapons, but has suffered a tragic lesson when it reached the gates of Madrid. The situation around Madrid is truly shocking. Kléber predicted that within a few days, the enemy would be unable to restrain its scattered troops. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>Talavera – The situation in the Madrid war is gradually becoming like the Battle of Flanders in Belgium during the European War. The trenches around the capital are filled with water, like small rivers, especially near the Toledo Bridge. Soldiers who stand upright in them will face death, so during battles they crawl through the mud to reach places where machine gun fire cannot continue to advance, and then use colored light to signal the artillery to bombard them fiercely. Progress on both sides is very slow, and it is feared that they will not be able to escape this situation for many days to come. Dense smoke rises from various parts of the capital, filling the sky. The rebels are very surprised by the flames near the Retiro Park because they have never attacked that area with bombs. Although the Ta Lakan Avenue is now controlled by the rebels' artillery, it is still open for refugees to pass through. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Several rebel bombers, using low clouds for cover, again came to the skies above the capital today to bomb the government forces' final lines of defense. The government forces' anti-aircraft guns failed to shoot down the enemy planes. The loud sound of the bombs shook the entire city. Their target was probably to bomb the Army Department. At the same time, the rebel artillery also opened fire and bombarded the city center. Residents were extremely panicked and fled for shelter upon hearing the sound. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>(Paris) – Negotiations between the General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Association on the implementation of collective labor contracts have broken down. Therefore, the cabinet is scheduled to meet at 6:00 PM to discuss the situation arising from the breakdown of these negotiations. It is reported that the cabinet is currently drafting a legal bill called the "Democratic Organization of the Right to Strike Act." This bill has been drafted since the establishment of the Popular Front government and will soon be submitted to the parliament. In addition, the Labor Committee of the Chamber of Deputies reviewed the draft law on compulsory arbitration of labor disputes this afternoon and will submit a report to the Chamber of Deputies next Tuesday. It is expected that the case will be quickly passed by the Chamber of Deputies. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The parties belonging to the Popular Front held a rally at the stadium yesterday afternoon, with no fewer than tens of thousands of participants. In an instant, it was full. Prime Minister Léon Blum immediately delivered a long speech, addressing various domestic and foreign policy issues, stating that the government formed by the Popular Front cannot be easily overthrown by others. However, if there is no internal unity, the danger of collapse will follow. Unity is the strength and life of the Popular Front. As for the government and myself, we are still loyal and unswerving. Some people encourage me by saying, "Léon Blum must do something." I dare to respond that I have already achieved much since taking office. Recently, I have submitted two bills to the parliament, one is an amendment to the publication law, and the other is related to compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. The agreement signed by representatives of both labor and management at the Prime Minister's Office in June of this year still exists. The government will also introduce a new bill to curb the rise in the cost of living. Although employers politely rejected a bill on wage increases and decreases being linked to the cost of living today, it is expected that the parliament will still pass it. All these measures are beneficial to the working class. However, if general strikes and factory occupations continue, these measures will inevitably be impossible to implement. (Havas, 28th)</p>

President Roosevelt spoke of the Americas Peace Conference to be held in the Argentine capital early next month, saying, "We will make war disappear from the New World at that conference and offer the New World to peace. North and South America can prove to the whole world that if international problems can be resolved through mutual understanding and goodwill, the achievement of peace is as easy as turning one's hand. The universe may be very dark, but this is a great opportunity for the people of the Americas to work hard. Our previous successes should encourage us to continue our efforts. Peace must be permanent, and we absolutely cannot tolerate aggression from any side."

<h3 id="e70">American Expert Discusses the Japan-Germany Pact: Will Expedite Unity of Britain, France, and Russia; U.S. Combat Strength Unchanged <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Colonel House, who served as a diplomatic aide to the late U.S. President Wilson during the European War and still possesses the potential to influence American foreign policy, stated in an interview with a New York-based reporter for the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun that the Japan-Germany pact would inevitably accelerate the unity of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and worsen Japan's international standing. World trends, however urgent, should not obscure historical facts, which are now being replayed. Those who act arbitrarily, hoping for quick success, and are easily swayed by notions of honor, are bound to suffer a crushing defeat. Who can predict that Mussolini and Hitler will not become a second Napoleon? Although Britain's military preparedness has lagged behind Germany and Italy in the past year or two, Britain can excellently make up for these deficiencies, as can France and the Soviet Union. In my opinion, the alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is only a matter of time. If the military strength of these three countries is combined against Germany and Italy, the outcome of the conflict will be very clear. Given these circumstances, what will be the result of concluding the Japan-Germany pact? Firstly, it will promote the alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and decisively thicken the military strength of the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union is a major power, it has changed its symbols and revised its constitution to join hands with Britain, France, and the United States. The world has already been divided into two major opposing camps: democracy and fascism. The Soviet Union has now joined the British, French, and American group, while Japan has joined the other camp. There is little doubt that Japan's diplomatic path will be fraught with thorns. To think that the United States lacks the capacity for war is a grave error. The United States is now as it was before, filled with people courageous in defense and battle, ready to change its peaceful policy at any time. If the Philippines were to be occupied, American public opinion would inevitably reach a boiling point. If Australia were threatened, Britain and the United States would likely take joint action. Such rumors have been around for a long time, but have not yet materialized. Canada was instrumental in the termination of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. The success of a British-American alliance will be pioneered by Canada. The United States will have no room for hesitation. The time when Britain and the United States jointly fight in the Pacific will be a good opportunity for the Soviet Union to join in the assistance. Britain's navy needs to go through several stages of development before it can devote its full strength to the Pacific, but from my observation, Britain will have completed this development when it cooperates with France and the Soviet Union. Japan knows that if the British-American combined fleet attacks Japan, the Soviet Union will inevitably attack Japan as well. It is expected that after the military strength of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been fully enhanced, the world situation will be very different from the present in just one year.

This is considered the main reason for signing this agreement, and the impending signing of the British-Italian Mediterranean agreement is sufficient to indicate that Italy is unlikely to participate in the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact.

Krutov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Far East Region, declared at the meeting that the Soviet Far East region is now stronger than ever and even more difficult to attack. If the enemy overestimates their strength and comes to attack, the laborers of the Far East will rise up to assist the Red Army and deal them a painful blow. A region that was extremely backward in the former imperial era has now become a prosperous industrial area and an indestructible fortress of Eastern socialism.

<p>Beiping Communication: In the past week, students in various parts of Beiping have been carrying out support-Suiyuan work, and the business community has followed suit on the 23rd. In the midst of this tense atmosphere of supporting Suiyuan, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation issue in North China has stalled invisibly. The Sino-Japanese air route, which had already been implemented, also has few passengers. The Beiping office of Huitong Airlines removed its wooden sign on the 24th. After the opening of the air route, the authorities have not yet allowed the Japanese side to attach military lines. Zhang Yunrong, chairman of the company, and Horiuchi, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, came to Beiping successively on the evening of the 24th to report to Song Zheyuan and discuss everything. Due to the active suppression of bandits in Suiyuan in recent days, the Japanese military atmosphere has become tense again, especially the Japanese Kwantung Army, which has clearly stated that it will directly participate in the military affairs of eastern Suiyuan. Key Japanese military figures in Beiping were also convened by Matsumuro to discuss matters. Japanese consultants from the Political Affairs Committee were all invited to participate and give instructions on matters needing attention.</p>

<p>Xiamen Communication: Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan war, the enthusiasm of the general public and students in Xiamen to donate money to support Suiyuan has been unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China. From the start of fundraising on the 19th to the 25th, a total of 25,000 yuan has been raised in one week. Among them, Xiamen University students donated 1,515 yuan themselves, and then divided into 30 teams to conduct widespread fundraising of more than 2,340 yuan on the 19th and 20th. The affiliated high school donated more than 500 yuan, totaling more than 4,374 yuan. From the 20th to the 23rd, various middle schools in Xiamen raised money along the roads for four days, totaling more than 2,071 yuan. Various trade associations of the Chamber of Commerce and various merchants have donated more than 13,500 yuan, and various circles and residents have donated more than 5,220 yuan, totaling more than 25,000 yuan in one week. The donations from various elementary schools have not yet been compiled, and the self-donation amounts from various banks have not yet been determined. The Chamber of Commerce appointed Huang Yishou and other ten people to solicit donations from major companies, shipping companies, wealthy merchants, and tycoons, and have not yet reported. These are not included. Ninety-one Xiamen University students divided into six teams to go to Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and the interior to promote, and set off on the 21st. The travel expenses of more than 280 yuan were provided by teachers and students. Among the above donations, there are noteworthy items: (1) All prisoners in the Xiamen Court and Prison fasted for one day on the 22nd and donated the saved food expenses of 50 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen.

(4) On the 25th, it was reported that the Suiyuan National Army had recovered Bailingmiao, and people's hearts were even more inspired. That morning, a woman stood in front of the Jiangsheng Daily, reading the newspaper posted in front of the door for half an hour, then entered the newspaper office and took off a gold ring and handed it to the newspaper staff, saying, "Please sell this gold ring for money and send it to the brave soldiers fighting for the country and nation on the front lines on behalf of your newspaper." When the newspaper staff asked for her name to issue a receipt, she replied, "Patriotism is also the duty of women, why leave a name? Just write 'anonymous'." In addition, various circles generally donate one day's income, families and individuals save money, families or institutions fast, and children donate candy money. The news of the recovery of Bailingmiao spread, and donations were even more enthusiastic. The Chamber of Commerce held a regular meeting on the 25th and decided to submit a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to convene various circles to organize the "Xiamen City Committee of All Circles to Comfort the Suiyuan Patriotic Soldiers" to establish a method for collecting and remitting funds due to the diverse methods of automatic donations from the people of the city, with many sending to the Central China Bank or newspapers in addition to student community fundraising. In Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and the interior, various circles in Zhangzhou organized the Committee to Comfort the Soldiers Defending the Territory in the Front of Zhangzhou and decided that all houses in the city would donate five days' rent, and civil servants and teachers would donate one day's salary, and organized 55 fundraising teams, which set off on the 25th for widespread fundraising. Various circles in Quanzhou organized the Jinjiang All Circles Committee to Assist the Suiyuan Anti-Enemy Soldiers for widespread fundraising. In addition, Haicheng, Kinmen, Hui'an, Yongchun, Nan'an, Datian, and other counties have all risen to donate money. Prisoners in Yongchun, Haicheng, Jinjiang, and Longxi fasted for one day. At the same time, there is also a "One Day Contribution to the Country" movement in Xiamen. From October 32 to November 25, more than 11,686 yuan was raised, which is sufficient to show that the spirit of the people of Xiamen has not declined. (November 27)</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The meeting commenced with a bell ringing twelve times, followed by the ringing of a handbell. After the customary greetings, presidium chairman He Baoding announced the reason for the convention, stating that the urgent situation in eastern Suiyuan was a critical moment for the survival of China. Fortunately, the soldiers stationed in Suiyuan were fighting to the death, which was of great significance and worthy of our admiration and assistance. We must understand that the war in eastern Suiyuan is not a localized issue, but the initiation of a struggle for the entire nation. Following him were Xida professor Deng Chumin, Deputy Director of the Political Training Department Xie Cangsheng, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Women's Association Preparatory Committee Guo Dejie, Guilin Girls' High School student Yi Fengying, and Xida student Jiang Zonglu, who all delivered passionate speeches.</p>

<p>Zhang Fulin, Director of the County Construction Bureau, stated that the county's 25th-year plan for labor requisition calls for the dredging of nine rivers in the third district (Jiuli Jing, Luwanggang, Daqiao Street Gang, and Hou Cao Wang Jing) and the seventh district (Yang River, Kuatang, and Zhang Miao She River).

<h3 id="e87">Changshu: Embezzlement Suspicions of Section Staff <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Changqi, a section staff member and concurrently the Land Tax Commissioner of the county government's Second Section, was suspected of embezzling a large sum of 1,000 yuan when he remitted it to Suzhou. The postal and telegraph inspector discovered this and deemed it suspicious, detaining him and sending him to the provincial government for verification. The provincial government, concerned about the situation, immediately ordered a secret investigation by the county. County Magistrate Chen found that Zhang Changqi had only been employed since March of this year, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan. Even if he had not spent a single penny, he would only have 600 yuan by the end of November, indicating a suspicion of embezzlement of public funds. Zhang was County Magistrate Chen's closest confidant. When questioned, Zhang defended himself, stating that the money was borrowed from a friend. The county government reported this to the provincial government. Regarding the reports in local newspapers, Zhang sent a letter requesting a correction. However, the local community is paying close attention to this case, and many doubts have arisen: (1) According to Zhang, he brought 800 yuan in cash when he came to Changshu. Now that he has borrowed 200 yuan, he combined it into a round sum and sent it back. However, Zhang has been in Changshu for nine months, so why didn't he deposit the cash in a bank to earn interest, instead keeping such a large amount of cash in his pocket? This is suspicious. (2) The Changshu Post Office can also send airmail express letters, so why did he have to go to Suzhou to send it? This is suspicious. (3) Zhang used envelopes and stationery printed with the Changshu County Government logo, indicating that he had prepared in advance and made a special trip to Suzhou to send it. This is suspicious. (4) In his letter, Zhang stated that he had previously remitted money. After sending this 1,000 yuan, he said that he would continue to send 500 yuan soon, indicating that the remittances were not just one time and the amount was not just 1,000 yuan. This is suspicious. Given the above points, local people advocate for a thorough investigation to clarify official corruption. Furthermore, it is reported that Bian Zhongtai, the director of the county government's local donation office, privately misappropriated over 3,000 yuan in donations without depositing it into the treasury. This was discovered by Zhu Xingliang, the chief accountant, who sealed the iron box at the office. He has reported it to the Provincial Finance Department for instructions and has sent a letter to the county requesting that Director Bian be placed under custody.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News reports that following the German-Japanese agreement, Tokyo電傳 (teletype transmission) reports that Japan will also conclude an agreement with Italy. The content is that Japan will recognize Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia in exchange for Italy's recognition of the puppet "Manchukuo" created by Japan. The news came as a surprise to all parties, with half believing and half doubting. Many believe that Italy has maintained friendly relations with China since the two countries mutually upgraded their diplomatic missions, so why would Italy be so unwise as to recognize the so-called "Manchukuo," undermining China's sovereignty and harming Sino-Italian relations. A Xin Sheng News reporter visited Luo Yaguono, the Italian ambassador to China, yesterday to inquire about the matter. Luo designated Embassy Counselor Bonaleli to meet with the reporter. Bonaleli neither admitted nor denied it, saying that they had only seen the news in the newspapers and did not know whether it was true. He could not tell the reporter anything. The reporter said that Italy is a member of the League of Nations and must abide by the League's resolution not to recognize the puppet Manchukuo, so it should not do this. Bonaleli also agreed with the reporter, expressing hope that the rumor would not become a reality. When the reporter further asked whether Italy would join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, Bonaleli also replied that he did not know, saying that the Italian government had not yet expressed any opinion on this matter.</p>

The Shanghai Grain, Bean, and Rice Trade Association sent Chairman Gu Xinyi and Standing Committee members Zhu Zixiang and Cai Yukun to the municipal government to petition. The municipal government immediately followed the resolution passed by the Executive Yuan on domestic food regulation and circulation and telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday morning, requesting them to immediately order the county to release the detained rice boats to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>Association to Petition in Nanjing The Beijing-Shanghai Municipal and County Rice Industry Joint Association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of rice industry groups from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Songjiang, Wujiang, Suzhou, Kunshan, Changshu, Qingpu, Jinshan, Taicang, Jiading, Changzhou, Nantong, and other counties at the Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road at 2:00 PM tomorrow to decide on sending a delegation to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies, requesting the release of the detained rice boats and ordering relevant provincial and municipal authorities to ensure that Shanghai rice merchants are not hindered when purchasing grain in the future.</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao Again Detains Rice Boats Zhujiajiao in Qingpu County continued to detain eight rice boats the day before yesterday, bringing the total number of previously detained rice boats to seventeen. Local rice merchants and farmers have sent representatives to the county government to petition, but the county government has stated that a passport from the Shanghai Municipal Government is required for passage. The county government sent a letter to the municipal government association. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday sent letters to the municipal government and the Bureau of Social Affairs, as well as to the Shanghai Local Association. The original text stated, "According to the letter from the Qingpu County Rice Industry Association dated the 26th of this month, 'Today, the Qingpu County Government suddenly dispatched police officers to detain rice boats carrying rice to Shanghai in the Zhujiajiao area of Qingpu, stating that a passport is required for release. Although representatives from our association visited the county magistrate to request exemption from detention, it was not granted. This matter is of great importance to both rice markets. Please forward it to the authorities immediately and order the release.' Furthermore, according to reports from rice merchants, the same situation has occurred in Jinshan County. We believe that the food supply in Shanghai depends on the interior. Given the large population of Shanghai and the high demand, the existing amount of rice is very small. If the counties all detain rice boats, it will inevitably cause panic and have a huge impact. Furthermore, we have recently seen news reports that the Executive Yuan has resolved that food from all provinces should be allowed to circulate freely. Therefore, the counties of Jiangsu Province should no longer detain rice boats, and passports should no longer be required. We respectfully submit this document to you, and (we beg that you) forward a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordering the counties of Qingpu and Jinshan to release all rice boats carrying rice to Shanghai and not to detain them in the future, so as to facilitate grain transport and maintain the food supply for the people. This is a public convenience."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Giant Winds from Low Pressure System: Northern Shipping Routes Assaulted; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Vessels Encountered Major Scare <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The recent severe winds have endangered ships navigating the northern routes. The Ping Shun's grounding on rocks was reported yesterday. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from ships on the northern routes reporting multiple encounters with severe winds. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Shun Encounter: The Yu Shun, belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, currently operates exclusively on the northern route. After its arrival in Lüshun, it was scheduled to tow a steel barge to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 27th, around 4 PM, the vessel arrived outside the Dagukou (Dagu Port) in Tianjin, intending to enter Dagu during the high tide and dock at the Zizhu Lin (Violet Bamboo Forest) in Tianjin. Unexpectedly, strong winds arose on the sea surface, and the waves at Dagukou rose like mountains. Due to its draft, the ship could not enter the port. Fortunately, Qian Yugui on board, recognizing the urgency and potential danger, wisely chose a safer location to take temporary shelter, awaiting the wind to subside and then attempting entry during the next high tide. Simultaneously, a dozen or so Chinese and foreign merchant ships, hindered by the reverse tide and unable to enter Dagu, also sought shelter. Vessels arriving later at Dagukou were subjected to the onslaught of giant winds and waves, resulting in danger and water damage to several ships. Consequently, the entry and exit of ships along the northern route were severely disrupted.</p>
<p>Xin Ming's Ordeal: The Xin Ming, also belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was originally scheduled for the Fuzhou route. However, due to the high volume of cargo on the northern route, its destination was temporarily changed to Yantai and Tianjin. The ship departed from Shanghai with a significant cargo load. On the afternoon of the 27th, around 5 PM, the ship reached the sea off Nan Gaojiao (South High Cape) in Shandong Province. It was struck by strong northwesterly winds. As the ship had already entered that area, the intense wind whipped up ferocious waves that battered the Xin Ming. The giant waves crashed over the ship's deck, causing the vessel to sway violently from side to side. Passengers inside the ship could not stand and were panicked. A portion of the cargo loaded on the deck was swept into the sea, resulting in considerable losses. The cargo in the hold was also water damaged. During this perilous situation, the captain bravely struggled against the wind and waves, using full speed to quickly navigate to nearby Rongcheng Bay for anchorage, thus escaping the danger. A telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday, stating that they were inspecting the lost cargo and awaiting the wind to subside before continuing north.</p>
<p>Tai Shun's Shelter: The Tai Shun was also fully loaded with grains and other goods destined for Tianjin. On the afternoon of the 27th, as the ship approached Zhifu (Chefoo) Port, strong winds swept across the sea, with wind and waves converging in a turbulent onslaught. The Tai Shun, despite the perilous circumstances, managed to escape the storm and anchored in Yantai Port for shelter. However, the passengers on board were greatly frightened. A telegram was also sent from the ship yesterday, reporting that they were awaiting the wind and waves to subside before resuming their voyage.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Taxpayer Association Announces Opinions on the Shanghai Municipal Council's Cost Reduction Plan: Exchange Compensation Should Be Abolished; Annual Savings of 1.7 Million Yuan <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday formally announced its opinions on the report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Committee on Retrenchment. The original text is as follows: The report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Committee on Retrenchment has been announced and implemented by the Board of Directors. It is found that if the administrative expenses of the concession are not appropriately reduced, the deficit in recent years will be around 3 million yuan. The ratepayers certainly feel the necessity of retrenchment, so in principle, the Association's position is no different from that of the Municipal Council. However, after carefully reading the retrenchment measures suggested in the report, the Association cannot help but have doubts. Currently, the salaries of the Shanghai Municipal Council staff consist of a base salary and various allowances. Many of these allowances are no longer necessary under the current circumstances, such as the exchange compensation. This compensation originated between 1929 and 1930, when the gold and silver exchange rate fluctuated greatly, causing the price of imported goods to soar, and the Council's finances were quite abundant. In consideration of the staff's difficulties, this compensation was specially granted. This additional benefit has been in existence for six years, and its amount in this year's budget reaches a huge sum of 1.7 million yuan. However, the current situation is completely different from when the compensation was first established, as is commonly seen. After the implementation of the legal currency policy, the exchange rate has become more stable, and prices have also fallen, as can be seen from the decline in housing prices. At the same time, the Council's finances are also feeling strained. Therefore, the Association believes that the exchange compensation has no reason to exist and should be completely abolished. Since its nature is temporary relief, its abolition would not be harsh on the staff. The Association believes that the measures suggested by the Committee on Retrenchment in this regard are not thorough. The proposed overall salary reduction of 8% is essentially including this compensation in the base salary and then reducing it. Therefore, the results are as follows: (1) The compensation, which was originally a temporary allowance, becomes part of the base salary after being merged, and its nature becomes permanent. (2) The so-called 8% salary reduction is raising the base salary and then discounting it. Because it turns the temporary allowance into a permanent salary, the base salary actually increases by 8.4%. (3) The staff's savings fund is currently deducted based on the base salary amount. In the future, it will be calculated by including the exchange compensation and deducted together. (4) After the exchange compensation is merged with the base salary, the senior staff of 90 people will still be given a new exchange compensation for one-seventh of their salary. Regarding the exchange compensation that should be obtained for various items such as pension funds, savings funds, and long vacation salaries, the Committee recommends: (1) The exchange compensation that should be obtained for the pension fund item should still be given. (2) The existing savings fund, in addition to interest, should still be given the exchange compensation at the current rate. (3) The exchange compensation that should be obtained for the long vacation salary item should still be given, but the rate should be reduced. The Association disagrees with these three measures. The Association believes that if retrenchment is sought, the most reasonable approach is to abolish the exchange compensation completely, instead of reducing salaries. This is the only way to save around 1.7 million yuan annually. The Council's treatment of the staff in this regard is obviously too generous, so it should be measured and restricted. This is one point. After the implementation of the entire report, the treatment of low-level staff is quite unfair. For example, the so-called new exchange subsidy is only enjoyed by the highest-level 90 people. The right to a long-term service pay increase is also limited to senior staff. The newly set salary scale for Chinese staff is particularly harsh. According to the new regulations, the annual salary increase is only equal to the minimum amount stipulated in the current regulations, or even less than that. In other words, according to the current regulations, Chinese staff can hope to have a salary increase higher than the minimum amount stipulated, while after the implementation of the new regulations, the salary increase they receive can only be equal to the previous minimum amount, or even less than that, but there is absolutely no hope of exceeding it. This is the second point. Finally, the committee suggested that the authorities should employ more local staff, which is welcome by the association. But the association wants to say that the Retrenchment Committee in 1930 had already suggested the use of senior Chinese staff. The chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council also solemnly declared at the ratepayers' annual meeting in 1931 that the employment of Western staff should be limited to positions that Chinese staff could not handle. In the same year, it also issued a notice to all administrative departments to earnestly implement it. According to the employment of senior Chinese staff, if it is promoted as much as possible, the savings in administrative expenses should not be small. Not only can salaries be saved, but also allowances such as long-term vacation travel expenses can be abolished. This section is a matter that should be fundamentally focused on by those who talk about retrenchment, but the committee omits it, which is regrettable. This is the third point, etc.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chinese Seamen's Party Department, Seamen's Union, Seamen's Branch, and various seamen's organizations welcomed Zhao Banfu and Yang Anguo yesterday. That evening, Du Yuesheng and others hosted a banquet. Mr. Zhao will go to the capital tonight to report to the central government. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, various seamen's organizations welcomed Zhao Banfu, representative of the Maritime Conference, and Yang Anguo, who returned after completing his studies, at the YMCA in Baixianqiao. Representatives from the Seamen's Party Department, Seamen's Union, Zhenjiang Branch, United Association of Marine Engineers, Yangtze River Leading Jiang Zonghui, Zhongcang Public Office, General Association of Ship Radio Operators, and other organizations, including Peng Bowei, Wang Jiyi, Cheng Zhuang, Liu Huogong, Sun Luping, Lv Shuangxi, Cheng Yongming, Cheng Gongxia, Wang Zhonggang, Li Jianbai, Wang Yalen, Zhang Donglin, Hu Qi, Song Xiaoyun, Wang Oumin, Jiang Yanqiu, Feng Fusheng, and others, more than 200 people, with Wang Jiyi, Peng Bowei, Cheng Zhuang, and Liu Huogong as the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>During the meeting, Wang Jiyi said in his speech, "Everyone, today various seamen's organizations welcome Mr. Zhao Banfu, representative of the Seamen's Conference, on his return to the country. This time, Mr. Zhao represented our country's 800,000 seamen at the Maritime Conference, greatly enhancing our international standing. Seeing the domestic situation, Mr. Zhao proposed three cases at the conference: (1) Abolish the contractor system, (2) Abolish the deposit system, (3) Equal treatment for international seamen. Thanks to his efforts, they were passed. At the same time, regarding working hours, our country has no restrictions, which is incomparable with the 48-hour work week in other countries. This matter was also proposed by Mr. Zhao and a convention was established. The above are just the major points. Mr. Zhao's hard work and great achievements are worthy of our praise. Today, I represent the national seamen to express our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Zhao."</p>
<p>Successive Speeches</p>
<p>Next, Liu Huogong gave a welcome speech, saying, "In the past, the lives of our seamen were bound by the contractor and deposit systems. Fortunately, Mr. Zhao proposed and eliminated them, which is a great blessing for our Haichang. Today, I represent the national Haichang party members to express our utmost respect to Mr. Zhao." Next, Peng Bowei said in his speech, "Everyone knows about the unequal treatment of our seamen internationally. This time, Mr. Zhao worked hard for the welfare of seamen, which should be appreciated. Our country has been weak for many years, so there are unequal facts in everything. If our seamen want equal treatment, they must first unite in spirit. I hope that all comrades will work together to live up to Mr. Zhao's hard work in attending the conference." Finally, Cheng Zhuang gave a speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's Reply</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Zhao replied, "Fellow comrades, this time I was recommended by Special Commissioner Yang and appointed by the central government to attend the National Labor Maritime Conference. I feel ashamed that I have not made any achievements due to my lack of talent and knowledge. Before going abroad, I discussed with the people present and learned that the pain of our country's seamen is nothing more than the three points of the contractor system, deposits, and treatment. With the approval of the central government, I proposed to the conference. Because there were too many proposals, I changed it to two cases: (1) Balance the treatment of Chinese and foreign Haichang, (2) Ban the contractor and deposit systems. The first point was strongly opposed by various countries, especially the British capital representatives. After much communication, it was passed. Another thing worth reporting is that the election of the Maritime Federation was not easy. My feeling is that in the past, attending was just to pass the proposal. The difference between our country's labor movement and those of other countries is due to the disparity in knowledge. The authorities in various countries can lead workers to be consistent. Director Peng's saying that spiritual unity can lead to consistency against the outside world is a very true saying. Banfu will go abroad to study again soon, and I am willing to report on the situation of seamen in various countries at any time, so as not to fail the expectations of the country. At the same time, I hope that you will implement spiritual unity so as to increase the international status of our Haichang. Thank you for the hospitality."</p>
<p>Report to the Capital</p>
<p>In the evening, Du Yuesheng, Xiao Zhenying, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Qun, Liu Zhilu, Sun Weidong, and others specially hosted a public banquet for Zhao and Yang Anguo at the International Hotel, inviting Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Wang Xiaolai, and others to accompany them. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 10 o'clock. According to Mr. Zhao's interview with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday, after returning to the country, I originally planned to go to the capital immediately, but due to unfinished private matters, I postponed the trip. Now it is scheduled to go to the capital on the evening of the 29th to report to the central government, various ministries, and commissions on the conference. As for the written report, it will be drafted and submitted after returning to Shanghai from Beijing.</p>

The next day, they were transferred to the Gao San Branch and interrogated. Shi was ordered to hand over a family guarantor who would be available at any time, and Zhang and Zou each handed over two family guarantors who would be available at any time. They were temporarily handed over to the defense lawyer and ordered to be released on bail, and then supplemented with a bail bond. On the 24th, the Gao San Branch received an official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, summoning Zhang and Zou to be arrested and detained, and ruled to transfer them to the procurator for review. The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, on the grounds that Zhang and Zou had another case of disturbing order in the Chinese Concession, sent Prosecutor Wang Jiamei and bailiffs to the Gao San Branch the day before yesterday evening to transfer Zhang and Zou to custody. However, regarding Shi Liang, Shi left Shanghai the morning after being released on bail to review files at the Suzhou Higher Court, and has not returned to Shanghai. The bailiff office sent detectives to guard and arrest Shi's home and the round-trip station. However, Shi Liang himself has not surrendered to the authorities as of 2:00 PM yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the Gao San Branch Procuratorate notified the two lawyers, Tang Hao and Zhang Zhirang, and the guarantor Wu Yinting (owner of Tianshunxiang Changji Hotel at 417 Lafayette Road, Shaoxing native), who was responsible for Shi Liang's case, to appear in court. Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan and a clerk came to the Sixth Criminal Court for interrogation. According to lawyers Tang and Zhang, they have tried their best to find Shi Liang, but have not seen him yet, and have notified his family, but there is no result. They are now only responsible for trying their best to find him. According to lawyer Tang, after receiving the notice from the court today, he called Shi's family and asked his brother to talk. After finishing the phone call, he received a letter from Shi Liang from another port and submitted the letter to the court. After reading Shi's letter, the court said to the two lawyers Tang and Zhang and the guarantor, you have no way to find Shi, and Shi's letter has stated that he wants to die, and has indeed escaped. The court ordered that an arrest warrant be issued in accordance with the law, and ordered the two lawyers Tang and Zhang and the guarantor Wu Yinting to be responsible for finding Shi Liang as soon as possible. After the order was completed, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e115">South Africa Implements Harsh Regulations to Destroy the Commerce of Our Overseas Chinese (Continued) The Returning Petition Representatives Have Arrived in Shanghai and Will Go to the Capital to Petition Our Authorities. Rental Law <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In order to realize its anti-Asian government, at this time, the overseas Chinese felt the threat of the severance of their livelihood, united to seek resistance, and telegraphed the central government to lodge a serious protest with Fiji, and asked Consul General Liu Yi to argue on the basis of reason. However, Consul Liu was a long-term and complacent person, and although he had been persuaded by the overseas Chinese groups many times, he still could not negotiate on the basis of reason, and still used the sad begging style of diplomacy to ask the Fiji government to give the overseas Chinese the same treatment as the Indians. I don't know that this is the fatal wound of our overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese were at a loss and could not end the day. They all said that Consul Liu's diplomacy was wrong, and one mistake could not be repeated. The Du Provincial Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce obtained Consul Liu's consent, and the overseas Chinese groups drafted the negotiation documents on behalf of the overseas Chinese groups, and Consul Liu signed and sealed them, and lodged a serious protest with the Fiji Federation on the position of an independent country and a friendly country. Persevering and unyielding, they asked the central government to quickly replace Consul Liu and send another capable person to Fiji to negotiate to solve the problem of hanging upside down. Fortunately, our government also understood the difficulties of the overseas Chinese and immediately sent He Zan as Consul General and Shao Ting as Consul to Fiji to negotiate. On the day the two consuls arrived in Fiji, the overseas Chinese all celebrated with their hands and voices. Consul He deployed the situation and immediately convened a congress of all Fijian overseas Chinese representatives to resolve the needle of external and internal forces in order to seek the liberation of our overseas Chinese. All things that should be promoted and reformed in the overseas Chinese society were carried out with great efforts in order to seek the practical cooperation between the consulate and the overseas Chinese and to seek the permanent welfare of the overseas Chinese. If the progress is unimpeded, our overseas Chinese will surely have a day of liberation. Unfortunately, in the process of Consul General He's hard work and progress, he aroused the jealousy of unscrupulous elements, and he intended to get rid of him. Consul General He learned that the Fiji Federation had obtained the right to diplomatic independence at the London Empire Conference in 1936, and the United Kingdom had no right to interfere in its internal affairs and diplomacy. All the diplomatic effects of the old Sino-British treaty had been lost, and there was no commercial or agreement between China and Fiji. The goal of the harsh regulations of the Federation is all Indians, because there are more than 200,000 Indians in Fiji, and their economic power is extremely strong. If they are not stopped, all industrial and commercial enterprises and the national economy will be manipulated by Indians after decades. Therefore, in order to maintain their livelihood, they have to stop the activities of Indians, so repeated negotiations will inevitably fail. Consul General He had a vision of this and used diplomatic means to conduct Sino-Fijian</p>
<p>Gentlemen's Agreement</p>
<p>In order to be the ladder for the conclusion of a commercial treaty, the overseas Chinese were removed from the harsh regulations. According to the content of the agreement, 50 Chinese businessmen are allowed to enter the country every year with the recommendation of the consulate, so as to promote the commerce between China and Fiji. There are 32 illegal overseas Chinese in Du Province who have always used the harsh regulations of the immigration law as a shortcut to get rich. For more than ten years, the industry and commerce of the motherland have declined, the rural economy has gone bankrupt, and life in the interior is difficult. Many people have the ambition to develop abroad, so there are no less than 300 people who smuggle into Du Province. These people who take the risk of smuggling into the country for the sake of food and clothing are all poor people. On the Philippine government side, it is recognized as illegal, but on the overseas Chinese side, it is recognized as a kind of pitiful person, and after all, it is a pure compatriot. The 32 harmful thieves regarded it as a great opportunity to get rich, so they colluded with immigration officials and unscrupulous police, and extorted money everywhere, so that those who smuggled into the country could not settle down, and the harmful thieves filled their private pockets. When they heard that Consul General He had concluded a gentleman's agreement with the Fiji Federation, guaranteed by the special envoy, which could allow merchants to enter the country, they were afraid that it would hinder their private attempts, so they used the agreement as a term to sell 3,000 overseas Chinese who had the right of residence, and opposed the establishment of the agreement by falsely borrowing the name of the community to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had doubts because of the opposition of these people and could not quickly order Consul He to sign and seal it. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out that the agreement was indeed beneficial to the overseas Chinese and telegraphed Consul He to sign and seal it, the Japan-Fiji agreement was newly established. "The people of Fiji did not understand the truth of the Japan-Fiji agreement," and rose up against it. The Fiji Federation government saw that the people opposed the Japan-Fiji agreement, so it overturned the Sino-Fijian agreement. (To be continued)</p>

Question: So you had already planned the move when you moved? Answer: No. Question: Why did you move when you were doing well on Shachang Street, and with the ten yuan moving fee? Answer: Zhao Yunhong introduced himself as a staff officer and said that his home was sick and inconvenient to live in, so he sent ten dollars to move. Question: Where did you get the money? Answer: The person surnamed Mao took me to the Huashang Inn. At that time, Li Ruiwu took out 200 yuan and gave it to Zhao Yunhong to give to Mao Yonghu. Question: Did Mao Yonghu distribute it? Answer: He gave me 50 yuan, Zhao took 20 yuan, and he took 30 yuan himself. Question: Why did they want to kill Japanese people? Answer: Mao deceived me, saying that to be patriotic, one must attack Japanese people, and it was okay to attack anyone. Question: Where did you meet Xiao Wang, Jin Daoquan, and the others? Answer: I didn't know them and didn't meet them. At this point, the official asked, Mao Yonghu, you said that Wang Zhensheng fired the gun, and Wang Zhensheng said that you fired the gun. Who fired the gun that day? Answer: Wang Zhensheng fired it, but Wang still insisted that Mao fired it. At that time, I was still fastening my pants. The official asked, since Wang Zhensheng said that Mao had hit someone, why did he give you the gun again? Answer: When he tricked me into going, he gave me the gun. I was really deceived. Heaven and earth are my witness. At this point, Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng thought that I had swallowed the 200 yuan, so they hated me. It's actually a false accusation. The official asked, if Mao Yonghu wanted to kill someone, why would he hold the gun himself and ask you to bring the gun when you went, and then give the gun back to you after the shooting? There's no reason for that. Answer: Because he was afraid of being caught by the police, he intentionally harmed me. At this point, Mao Yonghu interjected and said that during the discussion, it was stated that there would be an income of 200 yuan, so he was willing to go. After the two argued with each other, the official ordered them to be taken down.</p>

<p>To the court, Question: How did you become acquainted with Li Ruiwu? Answer: In January of this year. Question: When did he come to find you? Answer: In May, he came to find Mao Yonghu. Question: Didn't he come to find you with Xiao Wang a few days later, and the three of you went to eat at a small restaurant in the French Concession? Did he say he was looking for an enemy? Answer: That day, he found Mao Yonghu. Because he was his old friend, there was no need for me to recommend him. Question: How many days before attacking Japanese people? Answer: Seven or eight days.

Answer: About three or four days. Question: When did Mao Yonghu meet you after killing the Japanese person, reportedly returning to Jiangbei? Question: Were you present when the money was divided at the Huashang Inn and received 20 yuan? At that time, Li Ruiwu seemed angry and threw the money on the table. I didn't know how much there was. Mao Yonghu counted and distributed it. However, regarding receiving the money, he claimed that it was not given to him by Li Ruiwu and that he was unaware of the situation. At this point, Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were brought in for questioning. The official read Zhao Yunhong's statement and asked Mao Yonghu, "According to Zhao Yunhong, the money was given to Zhao by Li, but Zhao claims it was given directly to you." Answer: Yes. Question: Why are your words inconsistent? Answer: That's right. When it was brought, the money was placed on the table, and we were all there, so I took it and used it. Li Ruiwu said to give 100 yuan to someone surnamed Zhang. Question: When did he tell you? Answer: Li Ruiwu said to give 100 yuan to someone surnamed Zhang the first time the gun didn't fire. Question: Did you ask him why? Answer: No, probably he used it up. Question: Where is Li Ruiwu now? Answer: I don't know. If I knew his whereabouts, I would bite him to death. At this point,</p>

<p>Mrs. Hacklai</p>
<p>Acquires a Rare Animal:</p>
<p>White Bear Born in Xikang, Worth US$25,000</p>
<p>American Ms. Hacklai travelled to the border region of Sichuan and Tibet earlier this year to hunt the Great White Bear, a local specialty. However, due to the presence of bandits in the interior of Sichuan Province, she was stranded in Jiading for a long time. Later, she fell ill and passed away in Shanghai in the month of . To continue her husband's aspirations, her wife came to China in July of this year. However, despite her grand ambitions, a woman entering the remote wilderness to find a rare beast was actually without any assurance of success. Fortunately, in September, she received the assistance of Emperor Ling (transliterated), the younger brother of the well-known explorer Yang Dizhe, and was able to engage in a long march. After arriving in Chengdu, she travelled by land for ten days to reach the high mountains of Sichuan's border with snowy peaks. She set up four camps, assisted by local hunters. After many days of hard work, she still had no success. One day, she accidentally saw a large white bear. The hunter fired a shot, but the bear escaped. Suddenly, a young animal's cry was heard in the bamboo forest. The hunter knew it was a white bear cub and searched everywhere. They found a white bear cub about five weeks old, weighing about five pounds, in a hollow tree. This animal is a rare species in the world. Only six have been captured alive by explorers in Tibet to date, and they were not captured alive. In 1928, the Roosevelt expedition spent US$100,000 and only captured one. The difficulty and rarity of this can be imagined. Therefore, the small animal obtained by Mrs. Ha this time is estimated to be worth about US$25,000. Mrs. Ha was overjoyed when she got it. She took it by plane from Chengdu to Shanghai and hired a special person to take care of it, feeding it milk and other things. Mrs. Ha originally planned to take it back to the United States on the Russian Queen yesterday morning, but was unable to do so because customs procedures had not been completed. Therefore, Mrs. Ha is still carrying the animal in the Huizhong Hotel.</p>

<p>Ren Zhijian testified, 40 years old, from Shangyu, serving as an inspector in the Special Service Division of the Public Security Bureau, Question: Who was the first person arrested in this case? Answer: Chen Enming, Zhu Guisheng, and Jin Dao were arrested in the Jiande Apartment. We received a tip and went to stay there. We found out that their murder weapon, the handgun, had not arrived, so we waited until the 10th to arrest them. Question: Was Mao Yonghu arrested at the same time? Answer: No, he was arrested separately in Shachang. Question: Did Mao implicate Jin Daoquan? Answer: No. Question: Did Jin Daoquan implicate Mao Yonghu? Answer: No. Question: Can you describe the cause of the case in detail? They were counter-revolutionary cadres under the command of Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, and Liu Laosi (aka Li Duanwu). Our motive for the arrest was still the Nakayama Hideo case. The Nakayama Hideo case was completely participated in by Zhu Guisheng and others, while the Xuansheng case was a joint crime. As for Mao Yonghu, after the arrest, we arrested Zhang Mashi, who led us to No. Baoan Branch Road and arrested Wang Zhenchang, but he had already moved. Later, after guaranteeing her safety, she led us to Gongkuan Lane, Yangjiabang, and arrested Wang Zhensheng. At this point, witness Nie Qianchen testified, 44 years old, serving as a detective in the Public Security Bureau, Question: When did you go to Hujia Mu Bridge and recover the handgun? Answer: I went to recover the gun with Wang Zhensheng on the 18th. Question: Where was it found? Answer: In the trash pile. The handgun was already sunk in the mud. At this point, witness Wang Yulin testified, 28 years old, from Shandong, residing at No. 1, Lane 961, Lujiabang Road, serving as a detective in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Question: Have you investigated the case of Mao Yonghu killing Xuansheng? Answer: We were ordered by Special Agent Xi to arrest Mao Yonghu at No. 72, Shachang Street. We don't know the rest of the details. Only going to Hujia Mu Bridge to recover the handgun was me, Nie Qianchen, Kong Qingnan, and three others. Question: If the handgun was thrown in the trash can, how could it not have moved? Answer: That place is very remote and no one goes there. It was in a stone cave under the trash at the foot of the river bridge, sunk in the mud. and so on. At this point, the official announced that the witnesses in this case were not complete and would be interrogated further. Appointed defense lawyer Yu Chengxiu immediately stood up and said, This lawyer has two points to make. Zhu Guilong and Chen Enming said that they were arrested in Jiande in a very short time and were called there by Shi Jinshan. It is also said that this Shi Jinshan is now in the Public Security Bureau. If this person is an instigator, the Public Security Bureau should have already prosecuted and judged him in court. However, there may be special circumstances, and it should be investigated separately and sent to the case. But next time, the Public Security Bureau should be notified and Shi should be brought in for questioning. Also, the investigation team's copies in the investigation file are very detailed, saying that they are the written confessions of each defendant. Please bring the original handwritten confessions for reference. Also, the defendants are now prohibited from visiting. Please notify the warden to allow me to visit. The questioning official immediately approved the lawyer's visit, but not the family members. At this point, lawyer Yu Zhongluo also stood up and said, Although the court has appointed two lawyers to defend the defendants, they should still be allowed to choose their own. Now the visitation has been suspended, so there is no opportunity to choose a lawyer. It is still appropriate to allow visitation. The questioning official said that they can report to the prison, and visitation is still restricted. At this point, the defendants pleaded that they could only notify the prison and send things, so he ordered them to be dismissed from the court.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Liu Zhennan, the Murderer in the Assassination of Tang Youren Case, Was Transferred to the Court Yesterday: The Municipal Public Security Bureau Announces the Capture Process <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau announced the process of capturing the murderer in the assassination of former Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren as follows: The former Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren was assassinated by thugs in his residence on Ganshidong Road in the French Concession in November. Tang's family offered a reward for the arrest, and Mayor Wu added a heavy reward, ordering this bureau to cooperate with the French Concession Police Department to strictly arrest the murderer. After receiving the order, this bureau immediately instructed the Criminal Investigation Brigade to spare no expense, widely purchase informants, and conduct investigations in groups. Soon, according to informants, the murderer Liu Zhennan was still hiding near Shanghai, but his whereabouts were uncertain and difficult to confirm. Detectives were secretly deployed to follow him for a long time before it was discovered that the criminal lived at No. 228 Meifang Lane on Labor Sheng Road. At 2:00 PM on October 19th of this year, personnel were dispatched to the address and Liu Zhennan was arrested on the spot and taken to the bureau. This is the process of solving the case. The main points of the interrogation: Liu Zhennan confessed to the assassination of Tang Youren, how he arranged it in advance next door to Tang's residence on Ganshidong Road, how he shot on the spot, and how he escaped afterwards, all of which were described in detail. According to Liu Zhennan's confession, there was another person, Qiu Jiyu, who fired at the same time. Qiu was arrested in another case and sentenced to imprisonment, which was being carried out in the First Special District Court. Therefore, a letter was sent to the bureau to bring him in for joint investigation. Qiu Jiyu's confession was largely the same as Liu's, and he provided a particularly detailed account of how the murder weapon was buried in a wasteland next to Yinhua Lane on Labor Sheng Road after the assassination of Tang Youren, and how it was later unearthed. He also mentioned that the police had discovered a theft case and said, "Since Liu Zhennan has been arrested, I have no choice but to confess the truth and cannot escape punishment." The disposal of the case: The incident occurred on Ganshidong Road in the French Concession and should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court. Therefore, the arrested criminal Liu Zhennan was transferred to the Second Special District Local Court for trial yesterday. The court was requested to have the other criminal, Qiu Jiyu, brought from the First Special District Local Court for joint trial to ascertain the truth and administer justice. As for the fugitives Yang Yousheng (also known as Yusheng) and Xiao Mou, Xu Mou, etc., who are all accomplices, orders have been issued to continue strict investigation and wide deployment of detectives to ensure that they are brought to justice and no one escapes.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Zhabei Changan Road Fire Consumes Hundreds of Straw Houses; Three Men Burned Rescuing Items from the Blaze; Fire Truck Injures Five Poor People <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Every winter, the number of fires in the city is more than in other seasons. Investigations into the causes of the fires reveal that they are mostly due to warming by fire for cold, or from forgotten fires and accumulated firewood. Among these, the Pudong and Zhabei areas are the most prominent. This is because the former has many factories and the latter has many poor people's straw huts. Therefore, if a fire unfortunately occurs, it often leads to a major disaster. There have been many such cases over the years. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 o'clock, a major disaster occurred again at the intersection of Changan Road and Yutong Road in Zhabei. The area is inhabited by laborers, with closely packed straw huts numbering no less than two hundred. When the fire started, a strong westerly wind was blowing, so it quickly spread to the surrounding area. People were shouting, and there was great chaos. In addition, the weather was dry, and the straw was easily ignited. Within a few minutes, dozens of huts were burning. The poor people, young and old, fled for their lives, crying and wailing in a terrible state. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigades of Zhabei rushed fire trucks to put out the fire. However, the situation was already out of control, and the water was ineffective. They quickly focused on protecting the unburned straw huts and simultaneously poured water into the fire. After more than an hour of firefighting, the fire gradually subsided. As a result, more than one hundred and seventy straw huts were burned down. Among them, three men were burned while trying to retrieve belongings from the fire. After receiving treatment at Pushan Hospital, they were discharged. The arsonist was arrested on the spot. Three Jiangbei men, including Liu Yongfei, were taken to the police station. After questioning, they all denied responsibility, so they were temporarily detained for further investigation. The fire victims, having lost their homes and having nowhere to go, had no choice but to sit on the ground nearby, looking gaunt and miserable. The local police station is currently handling relief and aftermath matters. Also, when the fire was raging, the crowd of poor people gathered in the area, resulting in five people being injured by the second section of the Zhabei fire truck. Wang Honghan, 39, from Jiangbei, had his left leg crushed by the wheel. Tao Chen, 51, from Jiangbei, had her right foot crushed by the wheel. Both were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Two men and one woman, Liu Abei, 32, suffered head injuries, and Sun Qiming, 50, suffered facial injuries. As their injuries were minor, they were discharged after receiving treatment at the hospital.</p>

<p>The sensational headless trunk murder case, although the Hongkou Detective Huang Fusen and others arrested Lin Gendi, a hostess at the Xian Shi Amusement Park, and firefighters Mao A'gen and Jiang Yuantan, and Lin Gendi confessed that the headless trunk corpse was Cai Ying, a hostess from Da Xin, whom she had killed jointly with Mao and Jiang at 3 Cunfu Lane, Baibao Road. However, after thorough investigation by the Special First Court and the defendants' defense lawyers, such as Fan Gang, doubts remained, and no evidence could prove the fact of killing Cai Ying. Therefore, the presiding judge Zhong Qing declared Lin, Mao, and Jiang not guilty and advised the police to consider an appeal, as new evidence might be discovered during the appeal hearing. The Legal Department of the Municipal Council, after receiving the judgment, decided to appeal and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday. The written grounds for the appeal are being drafted by lawyer Zhang Shizhu, who is handling the prosecution of the case, and will be submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court soon.</p>

<p>To Reach the Path of Enlightenment—One Must Have a Sound Mind and Body! And Strive to Remove Neurasthenia, Which Destroys Vitality!</p>
<p>Young people in their student days yearn for mental clarity and strong memory like starving people seek food. This is the same mentality as the elderly seeking longevity and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>In adolescence, physiological sexual anxieties easily arise due to the activity of endocrine secretions in the reproductive organs. Mentally, anxieties are even greater due to the high desire for knowledge and indiscriminate reading. The state of anxiety during exams is even more intense! Therefore, almost seven or eight out of ten young students today feel the sorrow of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia – is an evil demon that destroys the vitality of youth in the dark! This disease can turn a promising youth into a pitiful and useless cripple. The happiness of life is completely lost. What a terrible disease!</p>
<p>The brain is the root of the nervous system. The nerve fibers emanating from the brain are like branches, spreading to various tissues and organs throughout the body. All our actions are commanded by the brain and transmitted by the nerves! And managing the life phenomena of its entire survival. Therefore, Gall said: "Human instincts, emotions, thoughts, talents, desires, and the brain are the source." From this perspective, the brain is the master of the human body - in other words, the brain is my lifeline. So, if you want to save the weakness of the nerves, you must replenish the nutrition of the brain.</p>
<p>If you want to cultivate a sound mind, dispel neurasthenia that destroys vitality, enhance intelligence, and strengthen willpower, only by taking Memory Neurolic "Mimir Brain Tonic" regularly can the brain be healthy, the nerves strong, and the energy abundant. Only in this way can you get the effect of a clear mind, agile thinking, and strong memory. Now, doctors in various countries have proven that "Mimir Brain Tonic" has the authority to save weakness and nourish the brain. According to reports from major hospitals in Europe and the United States, tens of millions of backward youths have regained their health and succeeded after taking this medicine.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Life of Asthma Patients Is Only Guaranteed After Thoroughly Curing the Disease <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhu Daxin</p>
<p>Only endocrine preparations are recognized by global medical experts. Not only can they immediately relieve the patient's breathing, but they also have the miraculous effect of quickly curing and preventing recurrence.</p>
<p>Asthma, what old doctors call phlegm drinking, is a difficulty in breathing with wheezing caused by narrowing of the trachea and bronchi. The pain of this disease when it occurs cannot be described in words. It is even more dangerous if the patient has complications of heart disease. In the event of an outbreak, if the rescue fails, it can lead to rapid deterioration - and immediately lead to unexpected disasters - the tragic outcome of death. Even asthma patients without heart disease, if not treated early, will often develop pulmonary emphysema in the long run. The heart, the primary driving force of life, is then compressed and cannot perform its functions, hindering circulation. Moreover, due to pulmonary emphysema - hindering respiratory function, even on weekdays, breathing is difficult, like being trapped in a cage. Therefore, patients suffer from both heart and lung diseases, and their lives are in danger at any time.</p>
<p>In the past, asthma was regarded by Chinese and foreign doctors as a stubborn and difficult disease to cure due to the lack of effective drugs. Most patients only know how to seek relief from pain during an attack, but after the attack stops, they do not seek a radical cure. It is just like the saying "clutching Buddha's feet when dying." They don't know the plan to prepare for a rainy day. Moreover, ordinary asthma medicines, although they can temporarily relieve asthma and cough, actually contain anesthetics. Once the drug wears off, they return to their original state. If patients use it every time they have an attack, they may eventually become chronically poisoned. Therefore, one should be cautious about taking asthma medicines and not take them indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Recently, doctors in various countries have unanimously recommended endocrine preparations for the treatment of asthma. This preparation can not only immediately relieve the patient's breathing, but also has a miraculous effect of quickly curing and preventing recurrence. Although this endocrine preparation has such great effects, it does not contain any anesthetic substances. Its effect is purely natural and is absolutely safe and appropriate for the human body without any drawbacks. Therefore, patients can use this preparation to carry out self-internal treatment and achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Among the endocrine preparations, Holipin is the most appreciated by doctors in various countries around the world. Holipin has the functions of relieving asthma and promoting qi, eliminating phlegm and benefiting the lungs, and strengthening the heart. It has special effects on various types of asthma, regardless of the elderly or children. And it is very safe.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Lung Disease Patients Should Clearly Understand That Killing Bacteria with Chemical Drugs is a Blind Treatment <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Kamsler M.D., Poland, Translated by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>The Quickest Way to Cure Lung Disease is to Perform Organ Therapy Safely and Appropriately</p>
<p>What is the effective method for treating pulmonary tuberculosis? This is a very important question that must be deeply investigated. Using strong drugs to kill tuberculosis bacteria (i.e., tuberculosis bacteria) is indeed what most people think of. But based on the facts, tuberculosis bacteria have extremely strong resistance. If strong drugs that can kill these bacteria are taken or injected by the patient, I am afraid that the drug will harm the human body before it reaches the bacteria. Therefore, it is a very foolish idea for patients to kill tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs with chemical and toxic drugs. There are thousands and hundreds of kinds of lung medicines on the market that claim to be effective in killing tuberculosis bacteria. This is nothing more than catering to the psychology of patients and achieving the purpose of collecting money. As for the actual effect of these drugs, it is only to assist the patient's digestion and reduce their cough, as a supplement to recuperation. It is a big mistake if patients mistakenly believe that these drugs are a fundamental treatment.</p>
<p>The current state of lung disease treatment can be described as extremely chaotic, making people unsure of which method to choose. Therefore, the most important thing to do today to launch a tuberculosis eradication campaign is to make the general public thoroughly understand the correct and safe treatment of lung disease. To surround the lesion of tuberculosis (i.e., the diseased part of the lung) and wait for the enemy (tuberculosis bacteria) to die on its own is the best policy. If you want to achieve this goal, then it all depends on enhancing the patient's own defense function (i.e., what is called resistance) and strengthening it, which is more reasonable. Because people can encircle tuberculosis bacteria and increase the formation of connective tissue embankments around the diseased part, building an extremely strong defense line, so that the bacteria cannot break out of the encirclement and cut off their food supply. As a result, tuberculosis bacteria lose their activity and die, so that lung disease can be safely cured. Therefore, if we want to fight tuberculosis bacteria, we must have this natural and strong defense function, which is not enough to kill them.</p>
<p>If you want to cure lung disease quickly, you must use appropriate methods to enhance the body's defense function. This treatment cannot be effective with chemical drugs. Only organ therapy can achieve the goal of strong defense function. Patients must truly recognize the quickest way to cure lung disease. There is no better method than organ therapy. If readers can widely disseminate this correct and safe organ therapy for lung disease, the number of tuberculosis victims in the world will be greatly reduced. As an individual, it is not difficult to escape suffering and avoid death.</p>
<p>Now, based on the principles of treating lung disease mentioned above, the German Tiebia Pharmaceutical Factory has referred to the theories of organ therapy invented by A.A. Beithold, Brown Sequard, and Starling and used scientific methods to extract the effective ingredients (i.e., endocrine hormones) from the fresh lungs and spleens of strong animals. Then, it is mixed with various precious medicines that benefit the lungs and nourish the body to make a special oral liquid for lung treatment. Its name is Pbith Weal. It has been used in long-term clinical trials in lung sanatoriums around the world. It is recognized that "Pulmonary Vitality" can indeed revive the function of the lungs that have been diseased and weakened, enhance the resistance of its living organs, and can increase the phagocytic effect of white blood cells. At the same time, it encourages the function of all cells and exerts the body's natural defense power. It increases connective tissue cells, fills the defects in the diseased part, and builds a fortress-shaped connective tissue wall around the diseased part, making it hardened. It promotes the formation of scars, completely wraps the evil tuberculosis bacteria, prohibits its activity, and is surrounded by white blood cells, causing it to disappear on its own. Therefore, people who take this "Pulmonary Vitality" can naturally produce antitoxins in the body and increase immunity and antibacterial effects.</p>
<p>Because this preparation has the above-mentioned special functions, after taking "Pulmonary Vitality", diseases such as lung disease in stages 1, 2, and 3, chronic cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, night sweats, and night sweats can achieve incredible effects within a few days. If you can take it with peace of mind for a period of two or three months, you will be cured.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Masturbation and Excessive Sex, Which Take Life <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>It is urgent to apply kidney-tonifying and sperm-strengthening agents to remedy</p>
<p>Confucius said: "In youth, blood and qi are not yet stable, so be careful with lust." When men and women are in the period of spring love and sexual desire is excited, it can most affect the body and mind. Scholars of German society call it: "the most dangerous period of life." Anyone who indulges in lust without restraint will have exhausted essence, damaged kidneys, and cut off true yuan, leading to weakness and illness. Most pulmonary tuberculosis in young people starts with lust.</p>
<p>It is often seen that young men and women, at the age of ignorance, when love first opens, either secretly read lewd books and novels, or their classmates make obscene jokes, thus giving rise to wanton desire. They often secretly release their treasures by masturbation, or frolic in brothels, indulging in wanton lust, or have nocturnal emissions in their dreams. All of these can consume energy and damage vitality. Therefore, gradually the limbs become weak, appetite decreases, waist pain and legs soften, dizziness, blurred vision, depression, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, and various symptoms of neurasthenia appear one after another. Parents are frightened and do not know what to do. Some think that it is congenital insufficiency, some think that it is caused by wind and cold, and some think that the nourishment is inappropriate. In fact, it is all self-inflicted.</p>
<p>An ancient sage said: "Lust is the first hurdle for young people." If you cannot overcome this hurdle, no matter how talented you are, you will not succeed. Because everything is based on the body. The body is based on essence as treasure. Therefore, if the essence is not exhausted, the ears and eyes will be sharp, and the body and mind will be healthy. Like oil nourishing a lamp, the lamp will not go out if the oil is not exhausted. Burning with lust easily exhausts the clear spirit, leading to kidney deficiency and physical weakness, eventually becoming consumption and dying prematurely. How can one not be afraid?</p>
<p>The sea of desire is boundless, turning back is the shore. This is what young people should be reminded of.</p>
<p>Physical Hygiene</p>
<p>During the period of spring love, sexual desire is very easy to be impulsive, and it is especially easy to fall into the bad habit of masturbation. Therefore, avoid stimulating excitement and refrain from drinking alcohol, because alcohol can arouse sexual desire. Young people must stay away from it.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the cultivation of mind and body on weekdays. Change all bad habits. Practice proper hygiene. Often walk in the wild. Do beneficial exercises. Avoid overwork of mind and body. If the body is weak, eat more nourishing food. According to Dr. Storl, a master of hygiene, people who have the bad habit of masturbation and find it difficult to quit are all congenitally neurotic. Because of weak willpower, they cannot control the behavior of this species. Therefore, nerve tonics should be used to nourish their brainpower, strengthen their body and mind, and make their willpower strong, so that they can control the habit of masturbation. This agent has been tested on many people and has achieved satisfactory results. They all show the spirit of being rich and powerful.</p>
<p>Effective Treatment for Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a symptom that must occur in people with masturbation and excessive sex. For example, heavy head, headache, dizziness, forgetfulness, insomnia, night sweats, palpitations, memory loss, general fatigue, lower back pain, constant work, pale skin, thin body, mental depression, nocturnal emission, etc. are all symptoms of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for this disease is to use brain tonic, a nerve tonic, which is indeed appropriate. However, recuperation and hygiene must still be emphasized at the same time.</p>
<p>The first choice for nerve tonics is the German "Mimir Brain Tonic" Memory Neurolic. It is said that it has incredible effects after taking it.</p>
<p>Tonifying the Kidneys and Strengthening Sperm to Treat Lust Consumption</p>
<p>Early marriage and indulgence in lust, and masturbation can all damage the primordial yang and cause dysfunction of the reproductive organs, such as impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, etc. If you want to save - to restore the health of sexual function, you should use sperm-strengthening and tonic agents that are effective and without drawbacks. The most effective are combined secretory preparations. Because this product is made from the testicles of strong animals, patients can promote the physiological functions of the reproductive organs after taking it. The function of producing semen is strong. The whole body is full of vitality, and the essence is doubled.</p>
<p>The first choice for combined endocrine preparations is "Well Tonic" This product is a sacred medicine for strengthening the kidneys and saving the kidneys from lust consumption and kidney deficiency. And it has no disadvantages of heat, dryness and fierce nature. You will see results after taking one or two bottles. If used as a tonic in winter, it can maintain youth and save the power of premature aging</p>

<h3 id="e141">French Merchants Show Off Their Might:  Tung Wah Suffers an Unprecedented Defeat; French Merchants Win by a Large Margin of Eight to Two; Category A Championship Puts Many Thorns in Tung Wah's Path; Disorganized Lineup is the Main Cause of Yesterday's Failure <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Tung Wah football team played the French Merchants in the Shanghai Western Football League's Category A competition at the Recreation Ground.  In the first round of the tournament, both teams had the highest records and harbored great ambitions to win the championship. As a result of the hard-fought battle, Tung Wah suffered an unprecedented and unmatched defeat by a score of two to eight. This was the first time in Tung Wah's history that this had happened. The 7,000 spectators inside the Recreation Ground were all dejected. In the first half, Tung Wah was able to resist, falling behind by only zero to one. In the second half, they were defeated in a rout, with the defense wide open and conceding as many as five goals in ten minutes. This game was of great importance to the Category A championship. It is hoped that Tung Wah can retaliate and recover in the second round.</p>
<p>The Course of the Battle</p>
<p>In yesterday's battle, the French Merchants were exceptionally rampant, turning the game upside down and completely controlling it. In the first half, Tung Wah barely resisted and was able to hold out for a while until D. Hart scored a goal fifteen minutes after the start of the game. Although the ball was mostly at the feet of the French Merchants, thanks to the skills of Cheung Wing-choi, he was able to defuse the danger one by one. In the second half, the French Merchants were still unstoppable, charging left and right. Within fifteen minutes, they were scored upon five goals in a row, creating an unprecedented record of a six-to-zero defeat. Fortunately, due to the laxity of the internal defense, they scored two goals later.  In the end, the score of eight to two was considered a great fortune, as it avoided being "goose-egged."  Tung Wah should be aware of its own shortcomings after this setback.</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>The performance of the entire Tung Wah team yesterday left a very bad impression on the audience, which can be described as unparalleled. The entire team was disorganized, with absolutely no cooperation to speak of. The weakness of the defense line was also the crux of the failure. Li Ning was ill, and Li Yichen returned north. Coupled with Chong Yau-yan, Chong was weak, and Li was unable to sprint quickly. Fung Wan-yau could not keep an eye on Robert Stoff. Enemy figures could be seen everywhere on the rear front.  The defenders were not scattered, and the supply of attacking forwards was cut off. In addition, the forward line was incomplete. Wan Chi-ho lacked both qualifications and experience. Siu Man had many opportunities, but rarely utilized them. Old Sun and Ah Dai were mediocre and lackluster. In contrast, the French Merchants had excellent and complete coordination, a good average talent, and a strong defense. It was difficult for Tung Wah to avoid defeat. If it were not for Cheung Wing-choi's efforts to block and defuse the danger, Tung Wah's defeat would have been even more devastating.</p>
<p>Situation After the Defeat</p>
<p>The situation after yesterday's game is that Tung Wah has 15 points from nine games. The French Merchants have the same number of points in eight games, and with one more opportunity to play, they have taken Tung Wah's top spot. Undoubtedly, the French Merchants can now take a two-point lead. However, Tung Wah still has a glimmer of hope, which is to beat the French Merchants in the second round. If the scores are still tied, the championship will be determined by the number of goals scored. Currently, the number of goals scored by Tung Wah is four goals less than the French Merchants (50 to 46). However, Tung Wah has eight fewer initial goals than the French Merchants (14 to 22). If the future can proceed smoothly and attention is paid to scoring more goals when facing weaker teams, it is not entirely hopeless. However, looking back at Tung Wah, there are many thorns ahead, and it seems unlikely to meet expectations.</p>
<p>First Goal Conceded</p>
<p>When the two sides first made contact, the French Merchants launched a full-scale attack. Farfan laughed and advanced alone, putting him in a very dangerous position. Cheung Wing-choi cleverly saved it. Tung Wah took advantage of the situation to counterattack. Ah Dai got the ball in front of the goal and passed it to Man Sheung-wah, who was about to shoot hard when Pau Chun-chung rushed out to rescue him. Tung Wah's efforts were in vain. The enemy's momentum gradually increased, and their generals returned to invade, penetrating deep into the hinterland. Fung Wan-yau resisted hard and put on an excellent performance. However, with the enemy's tactics, Tung Wah was in a state of crisis. The enemy generals shot at the goal as quickly as possible. Cheung Wing-choi made three desperate saves, and fortunately, nothing happened. Tung Wah was in a state of panic, with everyone on edge. Before long, the enemy launched another large-scale attack, breaking through three lines of defense. The two defenders could not resist, and D. Hart's foot seemed to have eyes, sending the ball straight into the net with a header. Tung Wah conceded the first goal, less than fifteen minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<p>Greatly Alarmed</p>
<p>After Tung Wah conceded a goal, it fueled the enemy's flames quite a bit. The French Merchants reverted to their old ways and continued to invade. Robert Stoff led the crowd to approach our position, and his angled shot from the right corner was fortunately unsuccessful. Soon after, Tung Wah had a chance to counterattack, and Man Sheung-wah sent troops from the left, but to no avail. Not long after the battle, the French Merchants emerged again from Mount Qi. Marsanier passed the ball to Robert Stoff, who shot hard and flat. The ball was swift and fast, but fortunately, it was saved by our brave general. Neither side made any progress. Tung Wah repeatedly missed good opportunities. Chen Zhenhe happened to get the ball in front of the goal and shot hard, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out, causing disappointment. As the first half was about to end, the French Merchants suddenly issued a general attack order. Five forwards gathered in Tung Wah's position. Siu Hart fired a powerful long shot. Cheung Wing-choi caught it and pushed it not far away. Collet rushed in, and Cheung punched it out. Farfan laughed and attacked again, but was caught and kicked away by Cheung. Under the huge waves, he did not make any major mistakes, earning a lot of applause. Tung Wah was down by one goal in the first half.</p>
<p>Five Cities Lost in a Row</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides reorganized their flags and drums. Tung Wah's offensive was quite strong for a while, but it was not very effective either. Before long, the French Merchants gradually became arrogant and launched a large-scale invasion. Pau Hulst stared intently, and Cheung Wing-choi saved it by diving to the ground. In an instant, our army was besieged again. Yichen created a corner kick, which Siu Hart took. D. Hart rose to the occasion and scored a header, sending the ball into the net. Tung Wah was dejected. Unexpectedly, one wave was not over, and another wave rose. Robert Stoff made a solo raid, and with a flick of his right foot, he scored again. At this point, Tung Wah was in bad luck. Robert Stoff scored three consecutive goals. Farfan laughed and rode straight into the formation. Tung Wah lost another city, losing six goals in total. The entire audience was shocked.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Goose Egg</p>
<p>Faced with such a great disaster, Tung Wah's generals were discouraged. Seeing the enemy cavalry rampaging, Sun Gam-shun was enraged and took charge of the overall situation alone. He maneuvered forward and passed the ball to Man Sheung-wah seven yards from the goal, who shot hard and fast, breaking the goose egg record and slightly relieving the suffocating atmosphere. Just as he was about to revive the country and restore the nation, bad news came. Siu Hart secretly crossed the Yinping Trail, and a surprise attack was launched again. Cheung Wing-choi was unable to dive in time, and he conceded another goal. Tung Wah's overall situation was gone, and he had no intention of fighting. Many good opportunities were missed. Dai Chung-kwan was furious and held Ah Dou alone, rushing straight into the enemy camp. Pau Sai-chung rushed out to rescue, but it was too late. Tung Wah regained a goal for the second time. At this time, the great battle between the two sides had passed, and the front line was calm. With no progress, the French Merchants' ambition did not die. Siu Hart took a corner kick from the right corner. Cheung Wing-choi jumped high to meet it, but the ball slipped from his fingers and into the net. Tung Wah was at the end of its rope and had no ability to counterattack. Soon after, the silver whistle sounded, and the French Merchants won with a record of eight to two.</p>

<p>The Hangzhou Zhijiang University basketball team, led by the school's Director of Sports, Mr. Xiong Datong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 26th) afternoon and stayed overnight at the Shanghai Baptist University Gymnasium. As soon as they unloaded their luggage, they played a friendly match with Shanghai Baptist University at the Shanghai Baptist University Gymnasium. There were more than 500 spectators. The battle between the two sides was extremely fierce, and their strengths were evenly matched. The scores were often only three to five points apart. Unfortunately, the Zhijiang players were disadvantaged due to travel fatigue and short stature. However, their coordination and personal skills were quite accomplished. Although Shanghai Baptist University had famous players such as Qian Jingyong, Zhijiang lost by only three points, which was commendable. The result was 29 to 26, with Shanghai Baptist University winning. It is said that the ticket money collected that evening was all remitted to Suiyuan to help the soldiers at the front.</p>

<p>Five West Green basketball games were played starting at 5:15 PM yesterday. Based on the performances of each team, Jinan's strength is considered the strongest. If this team participates in the university group, the hope of winning the championship is very high. Today, in the independent group, it is comparable to the strength of Sinton McKinley. It was very easy to win against Tsing Kwong yesterday. In the university group, St. John's defeated Tongji, but the situation was still tense. Fudan's victory over Shanghai Baptist University was one-sided. However, Fudan's performance clearly shows a lack of training in the rules, and the lineup is quite chaotic. However, the tall talent is indeed a capable material. In the junior group, Han Affiliated High School won by a large margin of 40 to 9 against the West Green A team for men, with the first half being 20 to 3. In another group, Moore defeated Shanghai Baptist University Affiliated High School. The results for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Moore Wins Shanghai Central (Junior): 26 to 23</p>
<p>Central Wins Men's Courage (Junior): 40 to 9</p>
<p>St. John's Wins Tongji (University): 49 to 23</p>
<p>Fudan Wins Shanghai Baptist University (University): 59 to 34</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Tsing Kwong (Independent): 58 to 27</p>

<h3 id="e151">Support Association from the Cultural Sector Telegraphed Song Zheyuan to Dispatch Troops to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Sector's Support Association for Suppressing Bandits in Suiyuan yesterday telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, requesting that the Chahar provincial authorities quickly dispatch troops to northern Chahar to assist in the suppression of bandit puppet troops. Mr. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee in Peiping: Since the deterioration of the North China issue, we have been fortunate to have your public loyalty to the party and the country, and your arduous support. The people of the country admire and appreciate all these difficulties. Now that the Mongol puppet bandit troops have led wolves into the house and invaded Sui territory, spying on our borders, fortunately, our national army has braved the cold and quickly marched on, bravely suppressing them and repeatedly achieving miraculous feats. They quickly recovered the famous city, and the good news has spread, inspiring the people. After the humiliating defeat, the ugly captives retreated to northern Chahar to gain support, and even used Zhangbei merchants and other places as their rear bases to prepare for another major offensive. This association is saddened by the fact that there is no survival without sacrifice and self-defense, and the divine power of our 29th Army in the Battle of the Great Wall in the past is even more unforgettable. We respectfully implore you to be concerned about the relationship between the lips and the teeth, and quickly order the Chahar provincial authorities to dispatch troops to northern Chahar to assist in the suppression, so that the ugly captive flock can be eradicated, and our homeland can be restored. This is the time. We respectfully telegraph and appeal, awaiting your clear instruction. The Shanghai Cultural Sector's Support Association for Suppressing Bandits in Suiyuan, reverently bows.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Yesterday, All the City's Secondary Schools Established a Principals' Association; Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau Attended the Meeting to Give Instructions; It Was Resolved to Console the Soldiers at the Front Who Were Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, all the secondary schools in the city held an inaugural meeting at the Minli Girls' High School on Wenmiao Road. In addition to amending the constitution, electing officers, and discussing various proposals, a general meeting declaration was also issued. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>List of Schools</p>
<p>Including Junyi, Youth, Daozhong, Huahua, China, Peiming, Dagong, YMCA, Nanyang, Huzhou, Mingde, Kunfan, Sisheng, Mingguang, Chengdong, Huiqun, Jinke, Minli, Minsheng, City North, Aesthetics, Private Shanghai, Jianguo, Cihang, Zhende, Zhengxing, Dazhong, Guangdong, Zhongde, Guohua, Qiaoguang, Quanzhang, Yuhua, Zhengshi, Shangnu, Qianye, Pudong, Fudan, Guangmai, Hubo, Sanyu, Patriotism, Huadong, Yucai, Minzhi, Qingxin, Minsheng, Binhai, Min Girls' High School, Yangjing, Xinhuan, Wusong, Guangxia, Jingye, more than 60 school principals, including Chong Hang-pak, Chan Kwan, Wong Cho-hung, Dong Kwong-chun, Chan Chai-shing, Lim Mei-yian, Tsai Tsang-man-wan, Fung Yat-sin, Yu Chuan-ting, Tong Yeung, Wong San-ming, Hui Sing-cho, Ku Kai-mo, Ma Ka-shing, Kam Yuet-cheung, Tsui Chak-heung, Sun Hon-bing, Mai Yau-hin, Kwai Ngai-sang, Cheung Choi-pak, Cheung Chung-wan, Cheng Hon-ching, Chow Lok-sam, Cho Yuen-chun, and more than 80 others. Mr. Pan Kong-zhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, specially attended the meeting to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The chairmanship was publicly assigned to Tong Hang-pak, Chan Kwan, Wong Cho-hung, Dong Kwong-chun, and Chan Chai-shing, with Tsui Chak-heung recording the minutes. After the ceremony, Tong Hang-pak delivered the report and announced the following reasons for the organization: Shanghai is the cultural hub of China, and its educational undertakings are also the most developed in Shanghai. Whatever is done, whether it is good or bad, is enough to influence the whole country, and even more so to influence the future of the nation. The purpose of education is to improve the past life, grasp the present trend, and create the future culture. Its greatest key is to be consistent with the national policy of reviving the nation. We have been engaged in education for several decades, and the younger ones have been in it for more than ten years. We all take education of young people and transforming society as our only lifelong responsibility, and we all take reviving the nation as the only guideline for education. However, although the goals are the same, the methods may not be able to be consistent. The reason is that secondary schools in Shanghai have never had proper contact. They have neither made active contributions to the education authorities nor have they been self-governing, unable to learn from each other's strengths. Although the paths may be different, it is difficult to increase the rate of implementing the educational policy. Moreover, the current situation is serious, and the country is in danger. To cope with the environment of extraordinary times, there must be education for extraordinary times. Our responsibilities are not to be ignored. Therefore, we organize the Shanghai Secondary School Principals' Association in order to discuss and deliberate, so that secondary education can be reasonably rebuilt and developed, and it is not only for solidarity and emotional connection.</p>
<p>Director Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Director Pan's speech was roughly as follows: Today is the establishment of the City's Secondary School Principals' Association. I am very honored to represent the Social Affairs Bureau and the City Party Department to attend this grand event. The number of secondary schools in this city exceeds 100. Although a few have not completed the registration procedures, most have completed them, and many of them have a long history. Now that we have this opportunity to expand the union, I believe that it will definitely make a very good contribution to the future of secondary education in this city. Secondary education is a very important stage. If secondary education is well-run, higher education will progress. Looking again at the vocational school vocational industry aspect included in the secondary education stage, whether new members will participate in the future depends on the success of the vocational schools. Therefore, the mission of those who run secondary education is particularly important. In the past, secondary education also had considerable organization, but only your association can gather all public and private schools in the city. At this time of tense situation, there are many middle school students who need your association's leadership. At the same time, assisting the government and gradually handling affairs in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations will definitely achieve good results. This is the greatest hope I represent the municipal authorities, and I wish your association success.</p>
<p>Proposals Passed</p>
<p>After Director Pan finished speaking, the constitution was amended and various proposals were discussed: (1) How should we respond to the movement to contribute one day's income? (2) How should we pay income tax? (3) How should we console and assist the soldiers at the front who are bravely suppressing bandits? It was resolved to discuss them at the next general meeting. Finally, the rotating committee members were elected, and Minli Girls' High School, Private Shanghai Middle School, Zhengshi Middle School, Jingye Middle School, Junyi Middle School, YMCA Middle School, and Daozhong Girls' School were appointed.</p>

<p>Yenmo Girls' School</p>
<p>Since the bandits disturbed Suiyuan, all teachers and students of the school had already initiated fundraising to donate to the soldiers fighting bravely against the enemy in the ice and snow. Recently, they have collected about 100 yuan in donations, intending to entrust the Shenbao newspaper to remit it to the front lines. Recently, the junior scouts of the elementary school department have been particularly enthusiastic. In addition to joining Xin School's donations, they have saved 15 yuan from their daily candy money and entrusted the Shenbao newspaper to remit it on their behalf, expressing their sincere patriotism.</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Dingxian Junior High School</p>
<p>Since the pseudo-bandit army invaded Suiyuan, our soldiers defending the territory have fought bravely in the freezing weather, and their spirit of sacrificing for the country is particularly admirable. All the teachers and students of the school immediately and voluntarily launched a donation movement to express their condolences. The faculty and staff donated all their income for one day, and all the students also reduced clothing and food, actively contributing. It is estimated that within two days of the launch, the money had been properly collected and handed over to the Dingxian branch of the Bank of China for direct remittance to Suiyuan, to be handed over by Chairman Fu to the soldiers at the front.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Grain: Internal and External Wars Predominate; Flour and Wheat Are Important; The Market Suddenly Booms in the Afternoon <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market conditions for each month showed a consistent upward trend. For foreign wheat quotations, Chicago and Canada both performed well, up 112 points. Liverpool also rose one penny zero. According to the trend of foreign wheat, there are military affairs, which frequently look higher. Therefore, when quoting prices, the buying interest was strong, and each month rose by one or two points. Later, major players moved in quickly and traded frequently. Although transactions were smooth, the ups and downs were temporarily balanced. When it came to the afternoon opening, people's hearts were greatly boosted again, and the value of difficult grains rose again. Observing the slowing military affairs, not only can the evening end, but also the thoughts of non-industry are revived, and each month is up one or two points higher than in the morning. Looking at the future market, it may be because foreign wheat has not yet approached, and hoarding and picking up prices are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Yesterday's Closing Compared</p>
<p>December 3.8725 3.8425 3.8625 Up 0.01315</p>
<p>January 3.8875 3.8625 2.8825 Up 0.0250</p>

<p>April 3.9400 2.9100 3.9275 Up 0.0375</p>
<p>When the wheat market opened in the morning, the market conditions for each month were initially flat, then jumped horizontally. When it first opened, transactions in each month were not smooth, and the market was stable. Due to buyers and sellers watching, there were no huge ups and downs, only two or three points better than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were prosperous, and the market was also showing profits. Due to the sharp rise in the flour market, oil beans and various miscellaneous grains have risen rapidly due to exports. Therefore, the buying interest in wheat has also gradually increased, up four or five points compared to the morning. Currently, the wheat market is showing an upward trend, with a continuation of three points. Because the arrival of goods has decreased and is being hoarded by the Shaanxi gang, those with goods want to sell at a good price. This different factory only entered more than 3,000 packages, and high-quality goods have been eaten up to 6.16 yuan. According to the speculation of people in the industry, if the source is not smooth, how will the rise be? It is difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest rice was only a few thousand packages. Although there is talk of lifting the ban on the transportation of rice, the water in the producing areas is shallow in winter, and the arrival is becoming increasingly rare, and the production price is still high. Therefore, the owners have always insisted on a firm market. The arrival of goods is unwilling to be sold at will. Although Cantonese imports were weak yesterday, people's hearts are still hopeful. The Shantou and Northern gangs on this street have some decorations. Although the total transaction volume decreased throughout the day, the market is still stable. A total of 2,138 packages of Gan rice, 690 packages of Jia and early coarse rice, and 500 packages of Wenzhou and Taiwan rice were opened throughout the day, and no other agreements were reached.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Sales of River Rice Were Stagnant Again Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still 121 sources of goods, totaling 14,000 shi, of which Bao Tao still accounted for two-thirds. However, the retail sales suddenly became slack. The gangs from Gouwei, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai also only handled more than 5,000 packages of Bao Tao and more than 2,000 packages of thick japonica rice, causing the market to decline. There is a lot of remaining Bao Tao, and people are inevitably worried. The price depreciated sharply, falling by 0.2 yuan, and thick japonica rice also fell by 0.1 yuan. Looking at the trend of the market in the future, it is still tired and weak. The supply and demand of Du Yangjian Lai is similar, and it can still be supported without honor or disgrace. However, the sales of Yinyuan distilleries suddenly became stagnant, so the market also saw a drop of one foot.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 60 sources of goods from He Xia. The sales of individual goods on the market were ordinary. The new market was weak in the early market and stabilized in the afternoon market. The price of Yang Du Fu Keshan and others was peaceful, and Bai Yuan's goods were popular and could be sold, and the price was temporarily set. Bao Tao Zhun Yan Dalian and other gangs have slightly weakened due to wide tax reasons. Xi'an's performance is moving, while the local city is flat, and the price trend is unchanged. The rest of the goods have no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Sales of Yellow Beans and Soybean Cakes Have Risen Together <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the soybean market turned active, but the market was only balanced with four-balance beans rising by five points, and the rest were stable. In short, the current source is only from Northeast beans, so Dalian is expensive, and this city is also affected. Now the rise in Dalian is due to the busy road to the frozen estuary in the north. The buying interest in this city is driven by two factors: the rise in Dalian and the recovery of the soybean cake sales market. Yesterday, the market traded more than 16,900 pieces of current four-brand cakes, and the market rose separately, resulting in the successive expansion of oil and sesame sales. The plan is to open 12 cars of four-balance beans, 1,500 packages of Zhengcheng beans, 2,200 packages of Niuzhuang green beans, 2 cars of Tongliao beans, Tieling beans, 1 car of Linzhun Pass beans, 1 car of Bengbu beans, 950 packages of Anqing beans, 400 packages of Dingjia beans, and a total of 1,300 to 1,400 packages of various beans from other Nanyang gangs and this street.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Soar, The Hidden Reasons for the Continuous Rise of Dalian Beans, Originally Yellow Beans Exchanged for Military Aircraft <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard oil-bean cake market rose unanimously, and the buying interest was lively, which was very abnormal. The reason for this, in addition to the continuous increase in Dalian telegrams, was also affected by the chaos of the buyers. Dalian telegrams have seen repeated increases in recent days. Yesterday, the current beans rose by nearly an angle, the cake by a large two or three points, and the oil by four or five angles to one yuan. As a result, people's hearts were even more excited, and the sellers came to operate from it. The December standard beans rose by nine points, January by a large 1.1 angle, February and April by a large 1.4 angle, and March by a large 1.3 angle. The standard oil in November once rose to 22.4 yuan, which was an increase of 1 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Later, some floating households closed out slightly, but people's hearts were still mostly upward. The closing prices for November and February were up 0.85 angle each, and January and March were up 0.8 angle each. The standards rose by two, three, and four points.</p>
<p>According to the opening, the reason why the price of Dalian beans has risen continuously in recent days is affected by the Japanese-German agreement and the slowing Suiyuan war. The Japanese and Germans are exchanging large quantities of soybeans for military equipment. The Japanese can use this military equipment to capture Suiyuan. Therefore, beans are being transported by the Germans in large quantities, causing the market price to skyrocket.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Yarn and Cotton: Overview of Yarn and Cotton Delivery; Yarn Rises 8 Yuan from Last Month; Cotton Falls 0.6 Yuan from Previous <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Jinjibiao yarn for the January period was launched on June 1st of this year, and the price was 200.05 yuan. It fell slightly to 198 yuan. Then, the market rumors that a huge amount of circulation bonds would be issued, and a certain direction came to buy vigorously. In addition, the price of yarn and cotton overseas rose unanimously, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The market price rebounded. Until the first ten days of the contract, the US cotton field estimate was announced, soaring more than 60 pounds. The market was shocked, and the market rose sharply, with a peak of 190 yuan. Then, due to the smooth rainfall in our country this year and abundant cotton production, the price of cotton fell, and selling returned to its position. The financial community turned from long to short and broke the 200 yuan mark again. In the recent two months, autumn sales have developed, and cloth trading has been smooth. All gangs have been purchasing enthusiastically, and the inventory of yarn and cloth warehouses has been swept away. The prosperity of yarn sales is a new record in the past five years. The factory's current yarn is out of stock. At the same time, labor disputes occurred in the yarn factory, and there was also a strike in Qingdao. Short sellers became more and more panicked, and the highest peak was 246.5 yuan. The final closing price was 246.1 yuan, an increase of 45.6 yuan from the launch price. As a result, only 2,510 packages were left, a decrease of 5,000 packages from last month. The delivery price was calculated based on the last three days, at 244.1 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan from last month. The delivered goods were new yarn, including 500 packages of 20-count Jincheng, 350 packages of Shuanglu, 200 packages of Wufu, and 150 packages of Muyang, totaling 1,200 packages. The rest were all self-delivered. The brand numbers and package amounts of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.</p>

The market price rose step by step to above 43 yuan. Then, on August 20th, our country's cotton production benefited from even rainfall. In addition, the price of cotton was high last year, and the cotton field increased sharply. The national cotton production was abundant, reaching more than 16 million dan. The market was shocked and full, and selling returned to its position. At the same time, the banking community turned from long to short, and the amount was huge. They all hedged the October period, and the market price plummeted step by step. The low price was 37.25 yuan. Until recently, due to the continuous advancement of the yarn market, the country flew beyond 2 yuan in one day, and the peak was 43.9 yuan. Swelling with the lack of welcome for old and rough lint cotton and the lack of acceptance for arbitrage, the market situation turned sharply downward, to 40.01 yuan, an increase of 0.45 yuan from the launch price.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to rise, and the sales of various goods gradually became smoother. The profitable state of spot goods remained undiminished from before. Although various Japanese factories in Qingdao have resumed work, the arrival of goods is not strong. The sales of blue cloth have been revived, and the Sichuan, Yunnan, Yangtze River, and local inland gangs have gradually started to handle them, resulting in an increase in the need for fine cloth. The market price of each item has increased by 0.05 or 0.075 yuan. Fine twill, with Cantonese, Changsha, Hankou, and dyeing routes, has increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per item. The Qingdao gang searched for more than 200 packages of Shanghai Factory's 15.5-pound 33 yuan ingot coarse cloth, and the local gang and the introducing gang also handled more than 60 packages. Spot goods are out of stock, and the market price has increased sharply by 0.15 yuan per item. The factory's 13.5-pound one-cow coarse cloth has followed the increase by 0.1 yuan (per item). Japanese merchants Itoh and Higashimian Trading Company opened fixed-head fine cloth for December and fine cloth and fine twill with dragon heads, flowers, birds, and auspicious patterns for January and February. In the past three days, more than 3,000 pieces have been opened in total. The market price for December is lower than the spot price by 0.15 yuan (per piece), and the market price for January and February is lower than the spot price by 0.3 yuan (per piece). The factory's fine twill is opened by various weaving factories in Changzhou for more than 300 pieces of futures for December, and the price is equal to the spot market price. Zhigong, serge, line cloth, and white flannel are handled from Tianjin for more than 100 boxes of spot goods. The need for heavy coarse cloth and low-grade goods is gradually increasing. Yesterday, the military uniform gang handled 50 pieces of 16.5-pound five-brand goods.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Woolen Market is Exceptionally High and Profitable <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the woolen market has been exceptionally good, with prosperous transactions and firm prices. The business and transactions of Western-style clothing gangs are all prosperous. The sales of overcoat wool are very smooth, and the domestic goods such as riding breeches wool, uniform wool, yellow wool, and medium-thick serge are in short supply. The factory is therefore rushing to weave more, but it still cannot meet half of the sales volume. Therefore, everyone is vying to order a large amount from Lianyi Company, the exclusive distributor of the factory's goods. Hongkang Dalun's trading in wool fabrics has suddenly increased. Unfortunately, the factory is suffering from not being able to sell smoothly. Even every time a car arrives at Lianyi, there are often many disputes due to competition. It is inevitable that one or two pieces are sent to each to solve it. It is difficult for stores not in Lianyi Company to get involved, which shows how profitable the goods are. The transactions of the local gangs are colder than before. This is because even if they rush to transport the goods to the destination, it is too late. However, the local guest gangs such as Nanjing and Hangzhou are very eager to purchase because of the convenience of shipping. Flat-thick wool and melton are both selling well in navy blue, because the hat gang and the uniforms newly popular this year all use navy blue. Therefore, the price of the same goods differs from the primary color by as much as 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, which shows the difficulty of doing business and cannot be predicted in advance. The five-yuan Guangkuan Da Ai wool, regardless of oblique flower, herringbone, square grid, silver grab, black grab, black and gray pure wool plain color, etc., are all in short supply and expensive. The market price rises several times a day. The domestic product of riding breeches wool has also seen frequent increases, while the price of Western goods has been fatigued. Because buyers and customers choose cheap goods for custom-made Da Ai, the sales of low-grade goods are fast, while high-grade goods are sluggish. Because cloth is newly popular, the selling price is even more profitable than chocolate cloth. The market demand for new silk woven long-haired camel down is stronger than last year, and the price is gradually increasing and there is still a shortage. Ordinary slightly acceptable ones must be sold for 13 or 14 yuan. Horse mane sleeve lining, French silk, horse tail lining, flower foreign cloth, etc., have all seen prices skyrocket due to timely sales. Silk glossy feather yarn has also continued to rise due to high costs. Jinshan feather yarn is also rising sharply because silk glossy feather yarn has continued to rise, so most of the linings of Western-style overcoats have been changed to it. Except for the deep colors that are in season, the sales of most pullover flower wools have become blunt, because it is cold and everyone is paying attention to the overcoat business.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market at the Chinese Securities Exchange continued its upward trend, with the market showing a strong surge. The victory in the Suiyuan battle boosted market sentiment, and the potential establishment of the Sino-American loan created a vibrant atmosphere. Major bullish players continued to absorb securities aggressively, and retail investors also joined in buying, leading to a consistent and sharp rise in prices. Class A bonds, in particular, were manipulated by speculators, causing them to soar to a new peak of $73.65. However, the closing saw a slight pullback due to retail investors taking profits and some large players selling off. Nevertheless, the overall trend in the bond market remains optimistic, with strong investor confidence and the apparent organization of major bullish players, suggesting continued abnormal development. However, the excessive price discounts have attracted the attention of those holding physical bonds, making a correction inevitable. Yesterday's opening saw excellent investor sentiment, with major players like numbers 35, 32, and 57 buying aggressively. Numbers 14, 44, and 11 also sold large amounts, leading to a uniform increase of $0.20 to $0.55. The second session saw even stronger gains, with major players like numbers 22, 59, 32, and 5 all buying aggressively, creating a very strong momentum.

Class A bonds, with a massive purchase by number 50, gained a remarkable $0.75 and almost $1.00. The afternoon opening saw the market remain very strong, with numbers 5, 47, and 10 showing even greater appetite for buying. Numbers 14 and 3 continued to sell actively. Except for Class C bonds for next month, which slightly fell by $0.10, all others continued to gain $0.10. Class A bonds for this month, with further absorption by number 50, rose another $0.50. The closing saw many retail bullish players taking profits, with numbers 3, 4, and 11 all selling, but numbers 50 and 35 continued to buy aggressively, causing a uniform pullback in prices of $0.10 to $0.45. Overall, all bonds rose by $0.34 to $0.65, with Class A bonds surging by $1.40 and $1.15. The total transaction volume was $13,555,000.

<p>— Qian Zhongzheng</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The sounds of cannons have shattered the god of peace; Clap! Clap! Clap! The sounds of gunfire have broken the sweet dreams of humanity; such a terrifying scene is enough to make people tremble.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a signal cannon is heard, and the entire team rushes forward like flying. Along the roads and paths they pass, "crimson blood flies," and "righteous spirit fills the air." What are they fighting for? For whom do they shed their heads and spill their hot blood?</p>
<p>They fight for justice, they fight for the survival of our nation, unwilling to succumb. Therefore, they are willing to sacrifice everything—bidding farewell to their parents, leaving their siblings, and going to the battlefield to fight to the death!</p>
<p>Soldiers on the front lines! I hope you work hard! Strive forward!</p>
<p>Take your guns and overthrow this power and tyranny. Ahead is the wide road to eternal happiness. May you bravely pass through it. I am willing to advance, treading on your bloodstains! Although there are thousands of miles of thorns ahead, as long as we have a spirit of fearlessness, we can forge a path!</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Story of a French Little Boy <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yin</p>
<p>In 1868, during the Franco-Prussian War, when news of the Prussian army's impending attack on Paris reached France, the French people felt extremely indignant and apprehensive. At this time, a young boy left his hometown and came to the military camp.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" an officer asked him.</p>
<p>"La Chennei, General!" he replied.</p>
<p>"Why did you become a soldier at such a young age?"</p>
<p>"Because I want to save this endangered motherland."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Later, he resolutely took on a very difficult and dangerous task that others dared not undertake—reconnoitering the enemy's situation—disguising himself as a deaf-mute, with a few pieces of bread and a short flute in his pocket, he left his army.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was captured by the enemy and watched by four fierce soldiers, leaving him no chance to escape.</p>
<p>When La Chennei was tied to a field camp by the Prussian soldiers, preparing to carry out the death penalty, he felt the terror of death for the first time; although his heart was splitting like cells dividing one by one, he showed no fear on the surface.</p>
<p>The Prussian officer sternly asked him if he was a French military scout. He just shook his head, as if saying, "I am a deaf-mute. I can't hear your words, nor can I understand your words." Then he took out the flute from his pocket and calmly began to play the score. In this way, he was finally released as a deaf-mute.</p>
<p>He escaped from the tiger's mouth back to his own camp, detailing the enemy's situation. As a result, Paris was able to turn danger into safety.</p>
<p>Dear children: What do you think of this story after hearing it? At that time, the French child La Chennei not only had great courage but also great wisdom. As a result, France finally relied on him to achieve its final survival. His contribution to the motherland was so great!</p>
<p>Children: The dangerous and serious situation of our country, China, at present, may be one day like the French situation during the Franco-Prussian War. At that time, I don't expect every child to achieve La Chennei's great career. However, in the end, I must offer the children some advice to make a practical preparation for you. Because no matter what you do, you must have sufficient preparation.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Three States of Matter <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One day, Min'er sat alone, blankly, silently thinking, feeling that this world was too wonderful.</p>
<p>"Min-di, what are you doing sitting blankly? Are you feeling unwell?" Cong'er, seeing his younger brother sitting blankly for a long time, asked him this way.</p>
<p>"No, I feel very comfortable. I'm just thinking, feeling that this world is too mysterious."</p>
<p>"Eh, what's mysterious? You think it's mysterious, where is it mysterious?"</p>
<p>"Look, in my surroundings, there isn't a single thing that's the same. That's a tank of clear water, that's a table. Don't you think it's mysterious?"</p>
<p>"What's mysterious? Water is a liquid, a table is a solid, of course they won't be the same."</p>
<p>"Brother, I want to ask you, what is a solid, what is a liquid? What's the difference?"</p>
<p>"All matter is divided into three states: (1) Solid: A solid has a definite shape and volume. What is a definite shape? It means that its shape will not change. For example, a table always has the same shape, and you never see today's table being square and tomorrow turning round. (2) Liquid: A liquid has a definite volume, but its shape changes with the container that holds it. What is a definite volume? For example, if you want to put a basin of water into a teacup, then this teacup will definitely not be able to hold the basin of water, and it will spill out of the cup. This is all because its volume is definite. However, its shape is ever-changing. (3) Gas: A gas has no definite shape or volume, it is the most wonderful. We cannot see it, so of course we cannot know its shape and volume. But in nature, there is an even stranger thing, which is that there is a kind of liquid that can become a solid and a gas, but it can also change back from a solid and a gas to its original state. Do you know what it is?"</p>
<p>"That liquid is water. It can be said to be the most important thing in the world, and also the most wonderful. Water is a kind of liquid, that's something everyone knows. If it encounters heat, it will turn into water vapor, and this water vapor is a gas. But if water vapor encounters cold, it will turn into rainwater, which is a liquid transformed from water vapor. If water encounters cold, it will condense into ice, and ice is a solid. But if ice encounters heat, part of it will turn into water vapor, and part of it will turn into water. Such a cycle is a very strange thing, but other things will not cycle in this way."</p>
<h3 id="e178">Becoming a Chrysanthemum <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tiewu</p>
<p>Ming'er visited the chrysanthemum exhibition with his father and said to his father, "Dad! Please buy a few pots to take back. It would be interesting to display them at home during the New Year!" His father said, "Silly child! It's getting cold. The chrysanthemums are going to wither, how can they last until the New Year?" Ming'er asked again, "Is there a way to keep them from withering?" His father stroked his beard and said, "Yes, there is. I'll tell you when we get home."</p>
<p>Ming'er's father, took Ming'er, passed a paper store, and his father bought a sheet of white Hanglian paper and a sheet of yellow paper. Then, he bought two chi of thin lead wire at a sundries store. He said to Ming'er, "I'll make a chrysanthemum when we get home, just like the ones you just saw, and it will never wither."</p>
<p>When his father got home, he folded the white paper several times and sewed it tightly in the middle (as shown in Figure 1). Then he took a small bowl—a compass would be better—placed it upside down on the folded paper, drew a circle around the small bowl with a pencil, and cut off the unused parts (as shown in Figure 2). Next, he divided the circular white paper into several equal parts with a pencil, forming chrysanthemum petal shapes, and cut them open with scissors (as shown in Figure 3). Then, he placed the cut petals on his lap, used an awl, placed the tip of the awl at the tip of the petal, and pulled it back forcefully. The petals would curl up, just like real petals (as shown in Figure 4). After all the petals were made, he peeled off the white paper one by one and glued them to the made flower center with paste (as shown in Figure 5). This created a chrysanthemum.</p>
<p>(The method for making the flower center is very simple, just fold the yellow paper several times, tie the lower part with lead wire, and cut the upper part into thin threads with scissors.)</p>
<p>He made the chrysanthemum and asked Ming'er, "Does it look like a real chrysanthemum?" Ming'er said, "It looks just like one." Ming'er then asked, "The white chrysanthemum is made like this, what about the red chrysanthemum? What about the yellow chrysanthemum?..." His father said, "That's easy. To make colored chrysanthemums, just apply the required color to the white paper before folding it."</p>
<p>Children: Do you like chrysanthemums? If you have time, it would be nice to make one to play with, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Our China is now suffering from a very severe invasion by the enemy. Soon we will have to go all out to resist them, and there will be a great war. In this war, the most terrible thing is the enemy's release of poison gas. If we inhale this poison gas, we will be injured if it is light, and we will lose our lives if it is heavy, and life will be very dangerous. Therefore, we should now have some common sense about poison gas protection, so that in future wars, if the enemy releases poison gas, we can take precautions to avoid harm.</p>
<p>Below are some common sense about poison gas protection. I hope that after everyone knows it, they will tell others about it.</p>
<p>When a poison gas bomb bursts, the sound is very small, and a lot of smoke or liquid flows out, and there is a special stench. When we encounter this situation, we can know that the enemy is releasing poison gas.</p>
<p>At this time, we must calm down and think about ways to defend ourselves; we must not panic and run around, because this is not helpful, and because the heart beats fast and breathing is rapid, the result is that a lot of poison gas is inhaled.</p>
<p>At home, we must first prepare things such as felt cotton curtains. When poison gas is released, immediately seal the windows and doors tightly to prevent poison gas from entering. It would be even better if a tightly sealed gas-proof room could be equipped. The food at home should be covered with airtight food covers, and the water well should be covered to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>If you want to escape from poison gas, you must pay attention to the wind direction and walk on the road that is at right angles to the wind direction. For example, if a westerly wind is blowing, you should run north or south, not east, because if you go with the wind, the poison gas will always be behind you, and you will never escape.</p>
<p>Also, it must be known that poison gas is heavier than air, so the poison gas is thicker in low places. Places such as fields, forests, and valleys are not to be visited. It is best to escape to a poison gas shelter, run upstairs, and close the windows tightly, which can reduce the amount of poison you are exposed to.</p>
<p>In advance, everyone should prepare two gas masks. When poison gas is released, put on the gas mask to avoid poison. If there is no gas mask, then you can cover your mouth and nose with a towel or handkerchief soaked in soapy water or urine, or take a bamboo tube filled with mud, soak it in urine, and attach it to your mouth and nose for breathing, and immediately escape to a high place or mountain where there is no poison gas.</p>
<p>If you have already been poisoned by poison gas, then quickly move to a place with fresh air, carefully take off your clothes, rinse your whole body with hot water, try to maintain your body temperature, drink some boiled water, tea or coffee, and then ask a doctor to treat you according to the nature of the poison gas. If you have been exposed to corrosive poison gas, then quickly wash your whole body with a bleach solution. People who have been poisoned should be quiet and should not move or scratch around, or excite their bodies, so as not to trigger the poison and increase the degree of harm.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Children, Arise! <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Big Kid</p>
<p>——A Letter to Children Nationwide</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>I often communicate with you, but I haven't had the opportunity. Now, because there are many things I must discuss with you, I am borrowing a corner of this garden to write you this open letter.</p>
<p>At present, our country has reached the era of storms, and our national crisis has reached its final moment. If we still have humanity, if we are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, we can only shoulder our responsibilities and rise up to save ourselves. Especially children, you should no longer hide in the arms of your parents and enjoy happiness, you should no longer be pampered and act as willful young ladies and gentlemen, because you are the cornerstone of the nation, the future masters of the country. For the sake of the country and the nation, you must train yourselves and encourage others to become patriotic and enthusiastic comrades.</p>
<p>In recent days, the pseudo-bandits have invaded Suiyuan, and the whole country is indignant. Fortunately, the generals guarding the territory in front and the enthusiastic soldiers on the border have risen up to resist the enemy. Now the heroes on the front line are fighting bloody battles in the icy and snowy weather, in the midst of artillery fire and smoke. They have forgotten their own lives, forgotten the cold on their bodies, and are only fighting and sacrificing for the sake of the motherland's mountains and rivers and the survival of the entire nation. But, dear children, how should we admire and respect those national heroes?</p>
<p>Recently, all parts of the country have launched a campaign to aid Suiyuan and to comfort the soldiers on the front lines; we only need to open the newspaper every day to see the automatic and enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, from adults and gentlemen to vendors and peddlers, as much as hundreds of thousands and as little as a dime. Some are even launching what are called one-day movements, dime movements, one-week movements, and fasting movements. This shows that our nation is indeed much more awake than in the past. Although these so-called movements may be a bit contrived, their patriotic enthusiasm is still commendable.</p>
<p>Although we are still young and cannot talk about dying on the battlefield, our patriotic enthusiasm comes from innocence and is no weaker than that of adults. Moreover, the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers on the front lines still require the support and encouragement of the people in the rear. I now hope that the children of the whole country will unite to aid Suiyuan, accumulate the expenses of games, toys, sweets, etc. on weekdays, or purchase necessary comfort items, and send them to the newspaper groups to transport them to the front lines, and at any time persuade classmates, companions, parents and relatives to donate; I believe that as long as you are willing to do this, the results must be very impressive!</p>
<p>Now is the time to roar; children, arise! Arise!</p>

<h3 id="e182">Letters That Others Cannot See <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>——Reply to Chen Huimin of Nanjing</p>
<p>Brother Huimin:</p>
<p>You told us about the scene of practicing tracking at the foot of Zijin Mountain. We thought about it carefully and felt that the reason for your failure was not as you imagined, because your team members took the wrong path. Because in any case, we think that not every team member would have entered the wrong path in this way.</p>
<p>According to our speculation: It must be that the secret letter you hid under the tree was discovered by the members of your friend team. Since they knew your secret, they changed the guiding signs you had prepared in advance, and of course the result was that your team members all took the wrong path. I wonder what you think of our speculation?</p>
<p>But whether our speculation is correct or not, you must design it more carefully when you practice tracking next time. Just talking about your secret letter, no matter how you place it there, you must find a way to give the team members a hint, usually by drawing a sign for hiding the letter in a conspicuous place. But you don't necessarily have to do this. As long as you and the team members agree in advance, the sign for hiding the letter may be changed to another method. Clever Young Pioneers will often secretly replace the "advance sign" with the "stop sign", and replace the "stop sign" with the "advance sign"! Also, you can tell the team members in advance that there may be a hidden letter at the roundabout, big tree or big rock, so your sign for hiding the letter does not need to be written in a conspicuous place: As for the newly built content, why do you need to write it out clearly? Have you forgotten the wonderful methods of secret communication? Every Young Pioneer should know at least three kinds of secret communication methods. I will give you a simple example here:</p>
<p>First, find a long and narrow strip of paper, for example, cut out the blank edge of the white paper, roll it diagonally along the Young Pioneer's army stick, and then write the words you want to write on it, writing vertically or horizontally is up to you. Then, when you take it off after writing, there will only be fragmented strokes or meaningless words on the paper strip. When your team member receives this paper strip and rolls it on the army stick in the same way, won't he understand the secret of the long strip of paper? But one thing to note is that the paper strip should be as narrow as possible.</p>
<p>This is just an example. You should of course use it as a basis to invent more methods. But no matter what method is good, as long as both of you know it, it will be ineffective if others know it.</p>
<p>I hope that your next tracking can achieve satisfactory results; I also hope to report to us again. Please, I wish you</p>
<p>Effort!</p>
<p>China Young Pioneer Self-Help Society respectfully replies</p>

<p>(Seven) When Min'er arrived at the bottom of the sea, he saw many strange and beautiful plants. (Eight) He walked and played at the bottom of the sea, and small fish swam by his side one by one. He felt very excited and forgot that he was at the bottom of the sea. (Nine) After a while, a group of very beautiful fish swam in front of him. (Ten) The fish looked like American freshwater fin fish, with yellow and black patterns on their bodies. (Eleven) He was enjoying watching, when suddenly a cloud of black water came from behind. He turned around and saw that it was a huge squid.</p>

<p>Bertha Koskov lay there trembling for a while. Finally, she heard the two of them snoring loudly, knowing that they were asleep. So she fell asleep soundly too, until after the sun was shining brightly, she was awakened by the old woman. The two of them actually prepared a very rich breakfast for her, and they spoke to her much more gently, asking her a lot of questions, but she only told them half of her story. The two of them listened quietly, seeming very interested, and even stated that they had searched her last night because they suspected she was a dishonest vagrant, and did not want to rob her money. Bertha Koskov happily left their house; but when she opened her money bag, she saw that the eighty copper Kopeks had turned into one hundred and twenty. She firmly believed that their original intention was indeed to rob her money, and that it was thanks to God somehow inspiring them to have good intentions, and instead helping her. In addition, she suffered a great fright. One day early in the morning, she was walking out from where she had stayed the night, and everyone else had not yet gotten up. She was the only one walking on the street. All the dogs in the village chased after her. She ran, hitting them desperately with her cane, but the more she hit them, the angrier they became. One of the dogs grabbed her skirt, causing her to fall to the ground, and she suddenly felt a cold nose against the back of her neck; but the dog sniffed her, and did not even bite her. At this time, a farmer happened to pass by and drove all the dogs away.</p>
<p>Severe winter had arrived, and it had snowed heavily for eight consecutive days, forcing her to stay. But when she was preparing to set off again, the farmers busily told her that if she were to walk alone in such a large snowdrift, even the strongest man would lose his life, because the wind would roll up the snow on the ground, making it impossible to distinguish the road, and it would be very dangerous to walk through. Therefore, they kept her, waiting for a team of snow carts to arrive, which were carrying food to Igasarininburg to supply the Christmas banquet. The drivers of those snow carts listened to her story and were willing to let her sit in their carts, but her clothes were very thin and not suitable for winter travel. Although they had unloaded the wrapping cloth from their goods and wrapped it around her, on the fourth day at a desolate post station, she could not bear the attack of the severe cold, and one of her cheeks was already frostbitten. They had to take her off the snow cart and rub her cheeks with snow to prevent frostbite, and they were very concerned about her. They all said that without a sheepskin coat, they could not take her forward, because the farther they went, the colder it would be, and she would definitely be frozen to death. Bertha Koskov thought that she could no longer travel with these kind-hearted people, and that the post station might not be able to keep her, which put her in a dilemma, and she could not help but cry sadly. The drivers, seeing that she was very pitiful, agreed to pool some money to buy her a sheepskin coat, but there was no place to buy one; the people at the post station could not give up their coats either, because this was a very remote place, and it was really not easy to buy another coat. Although the drivers had tried to negotiate with the waitress in the hotel at a particularly high price, possibly selling her coat, she also refused.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Review of Gu Jiegang's Edited "Popular Knowledge" <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziliang</p>
<p>——Price per issue: 16 cents. Sole distributor: Shanghai Yadong Library——</p>
<p>"Popular Knowledge" is edited by Mr. Gu Jiegang, which I believe is already known to the readers. My overall impression of this publication is relatively positive, and I feel that it is one of the more readable periodicals available today. However, to truly critique it, it also has its shortcomings. Let's examine the recently published third issue.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this issue of "Popular Knowledge," like the previous two, still lacks richness in content. For example, philosophy, social sciences, literary theory, and international politics and economics are not prominently featured, or even completely absent, in this issue of "Popular Knowledge." However, these are precisely the "knowledge" that the "masses" urgently demand. Of course, the space of a semi-monthly publication is limited, and it cannot include all "knowledge." However, under the current circumstances, a publication that claims to be "Popular Knowledge" should have philosophy as the foundation of all theories, as well as international politics and economics that are closely related to everyone's real lives. "Popular Knowledge" emphasizes introductions to the lives and character of famous figures in ancient China and devotes a large amount of space to publishing articles of the "casual talk" and "essay" type. This cannot be said to be completely wrong, but comparatively, I believe that instead of using so much space to publish these things, it would be better to collect more of the aforementioned more important knowledge to enrich the content of the publication.</p>
<p>This issue of "Popular Knowledge" contains four quite serious essays: The first is Mr. Wu Shichang's "On the Trend of Higher Education Emphasizing Science and Engineering." This article offers very appropriate criticisms of the opinions of those who "emphasize science and engineering" education and despise the humanities and law disciplines, and of the shallow views that only value technology and disregard theory. The author also clearly points out that "it is not a national disgrace if a country unfortunately lags behind in technology and needs to import talent from other countries"; "However, if a country's fundamental plan is handled and decided without great vision, resulting in a mess and forcing it to listen to the interference and coercion of 'friendly nations' or other countries, that is a great shame and disgrace, and a fatal disease of national subjugation." Finally, it concludes that "we should now (1) start by promoting academic thought, to (2) cultivate a scientific spirit, attitude, and method—rather than a narrow type of technology." These are all undeniable in principle. However, when Mr. Wu criticizes those shallow views, he only engages in theoretical debates and does not fundamentally point out the social intentions of those "emphasizing science and engineering" technocrats who are planning for the interests of a minority, preventing readers from more deeply understanding why they would adopt such methods. Moreover, even in the theoretical criticism, in some places, he still reveals the backwardness of his own fundamental stance, such as his absolute endorsement of Kant without knowing the errors of his agnosticism. At the same time, what is even more puzzling is that in expressing his opinions on Chinese higher education based on general theory and China's actual situation, and in demonstrating the positive role of education for the country and society, Mr. Wu suddenly put forward the proposition of "learning for the sake of learning," saying it is "the most precious spirit in learning." If this proposition is correct, then students need not think about the country and nation when studying, and educators need not think about the role of education, making Mr. Wu's educational opinions superfluous. In my opinion, Mr. Wu confuses the utilitarianism of learning, the theory of "applying what one has learned," and the tendency to "treat learning only as a stepping stone." Therefore, he praises the spirit of "learning for the sake of learning." We believe that it is indeed wrong to study for the sake of becoming an official and getting rich, but "applying what one has learned" is a correct proposition. It is perfectly acceptable to encourage students to concentrate on research, but advocating "learning for the sake of learning" is unacceptable, because the latter implies that people should study in isolation from reality, "building a cart behind closed doors." In fact, science and engineering are naturally very practical, and even the humanities and law disciplines are very useful, isn't this something that even Mr. Wu admits? Therefore, the so-called spirit of "learning for the sake of learning" is entirely nonsense. The second is Mr. Zhu Baochang's "United Front in National Crisis," and the third is Mr. Lian Shisheng's "Overproduction and Underconsumption." We have no other opinions on these two articles except to say that the content is lacking in richness. Finally, there is Mr. Gu Jiegang's</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Sacrifice." In this essay, Mr. Gu asks everyone to sacrifice for national liberation, to sacrifice the individual "small self" for the survival of the race's "big self." This is indeed a very correct proposition at present. However, in my opinion, due to the continuous attacks of the enemy, the interests of various groups of people in China and the interests of the entire nation have more or less converged. Therefore, we should not only awaken the people to sacrifice the individual for the nation, but also awaken them to rise up and save themselves. Saving the country and saving oneself are one and the same issue at present and do not conflict. We should unite to save the country and save ourselves. Awakening the general public in this way will achieve greater results. At the same time, Mr. Gu also said at the beginning of the article: "Maintaining one's own survival and possessing one's own private property are two basic desires of mankind, which everyone has. All phenomena of human survival, evolution, and development are derived and sublimated from these two desires." We believe that this cannot become a general absolute judgment because, in a certain stage of historical development, mankind did not have "private property," and therefore had no desire for private ownership. In fact, aren't there countries in the world now that have no desire for private ownership? Yet no one can say that those countries are not "evolving." Therefore, although Mr. Gu's proposition is correct in China at present, the basic theoretical arguments still deserve further study.</p>
<p>There are two current affairs commentaries: namely, "The Long-Term Negotiations Between China and Japan" and "Roosevelt's Re-election as US President." We have no differing opinions on the former and can skip it. As for the latter, it only explains that Landon's "conservative thinking" and his closeness to the coalition party of Lemke and Coughlin were the reasons for his failure. It only superficially introduces the general policies implemented by Roosevelt and does not more deeply point out the groups of people represented by the American Republican and Democratic parties and the essence of the policies they implement in the election competition. At the same time, the article does not provide any analysis of the impact of Roosevelt's re-election on the United States and the world. Strictly speaking, this is very inadequate.</p>
<p>One of the main features of "Popular Knowledge" is its fondness for publishing biographies of ancient people. Their intention is nothing more than to teach people today by describing the character and lives of certain ancient people, which is certainly not to be criticized. However, when we rewrite about ancient people, we should not only talk about their family environment and private lives but also explain all their expressions from their social environment. Because in this way, readers can have a deeper understanding of ancient people and history and can receive more powerful lessons. However, this publication is not like that. For example, Mr. Zheng Kankan's "Wang Anshi" in this issue only explains Wang Anshi's achievements based on his family environment and his nature and simply attributes the reasons for Anshi's failure to his "not humiliating himself," "being good at self-preservation," and "not cooperating with others." This can be said to be a completely individualistic view. We ask: If Wang lived in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, could he "implement reforms"? If commercial capital in the Song dynasty had defeated the feudal landlords, would there be any fault to find with Anshi's "not humiliating himself," "being good at self-preservation," and "not cooperating with others"? This is probably difficult for the author of the article to answer. Another example is Mr. Wang Chongwu's "Hoelun" (Genghis Khan Temujin's mother), which also simply attributes Temujin's achievements to his mother's teaching. From the author's intention, it is to have mothers now learn from Hoelun and teach us a few Temujins. This cannot be said to be wrong, but to rely on mother's education to revive the nation, to have women all become Hoelun, is to exaggerate the subject too much, exaggerating it to the point of being wrong.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen's "The Significance of the Literary World's United Front" asks people to be "tolerant" on one hand, but on the other hand, it firmly adheres to history, saying how the past was like this and how the past was like that, which seems a bit unfair, although Mr. Shen's basic stance is consistent with everyone's. Mr. Lu Zheyi's novel "Eyes" is a work rich in national liberation consciousness, but the descriptive techniques cannot be said to be refined; some places are even "speeding." Mr. Tian Tao's novel, "Heat," is an even more immature creation. Not only does the content lack positive meaning, but the structure of the writing and the organization of the story are also very loose.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that people will regard this criticism as well-intentioned, and we hope that "Popular Knowledge" can continuously enrich its content, continue to improve, and become a very progressive publication. We also love to read some of the writings and theories in "Popular Knowledge," so we put forward the above opinions, hoping that Mr. Gu can edit it even better.</p>
<p>Humorous Sketch</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Barber's Curse <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Ming</p>
<p>I can assume that every discerning person will agree with me that one of the most hateful things in a person's life is a haircut. Every week, or at most every two weeks, you have to endure this almost prescribed punishment. For as long as you live in this so-called civilized world, you have to endure this punishment. Of course, the hair of savages grows so long, but in this modern era, everything must be "streamlined" and maintain a popular style, so you have to consider your appearance. For this reason, one has reason to envy the cleverness of the Indian Sikh, who hides his messy hair under his colorful turban and lets his beard make his face ugly, without bothering himself with weekly haircuts and daily shaves. In this way, how much time and trouble can be saved, and should we learn from their example?</p>
<p>I hate going to the barbershop. First, you have to wait for your turn. A good barbershop is often crowded with customers. Sometimes, this wait may continue for as long as half an hour. Then, when it's your turn, you have to sit motionless in a special chair (the design of this chair is for the convenience of the barber and less for the comfort of the customer), for a time that ranges from half an hour to an hour, all depending on the barber's skill. During this time, all your freedom is lost. You have to obediently and quickly follow his commands, turning your head this way and that way, and often even conforming to his arbitrary arrangements.</p>
<p>Barbers seem to be mostly unkind. They cut your hair and shave your face with the same carelessness as peeling sweet potatoes. They grab your head with great force, as if afraid you're going to slip out of their hands. They use so many fancy techniques with scissors and razors that you can't help but shiver at the sight. They also shake your head frequently, and before half of the haircut is done, you're already dizzy. Yet you have to endure this pain without protest, for fear that an angry barber will deliberately harm your noble head.</p>
<p>In addition to being bound to the chair without any freedom of movement and the many sufferings you endure, you also have the fear of what parts of your face the barber's scissors and razors will cut off. This fear is not entirely unfounded, because you can't expect the barber to be clear-headed all day long. He may have drunk too much wine or be indulging in the pleasure of daydreaming while working, or he may have lost interest and attention in his monotonous barbering work. Any of these situations can make him forget the work in his hands and the sacredness of your head. Therefore, every time I decide to leave the barbershop, I always carefully and tightly hold my head in front of the mirror to check whether I have lost anything before paying.</p>
<p>I heard that a famous general always had four guards holding pistols to protect him when he got a haircut, for fear that the barber was colluding with his political enemies. With just a flick of that sharp razor, his throat could be cut. In addition, we also heard that this general always chose a new barber every time he needed a haircut, so that his political enemies would not have the opportunity to assassinate him through the barber. This example shows how a general should take precautions when getting a haircut. Undoubtedly, we civilians don't have to worry about someone colluding with the barber to harm us, but we still can't be at ease, because who can say that the barber won't accidentally cut something off your face?</p>
<p>I often think that if someone could invent a machine that could use its own hands to cut one's hair into any style within five minutes, how beneficial would that be to humanity. We are talking about saving time and energy. I wonder why someone doesn't apply their genius to the invention of a haircutting machine that saves time and energy. Given the fact that complicated machines are invented from time to time, I don't believe that it is completely impossible to invent such a haircutting machine. Some inventions do improve people's fate, but if we still have to endure the punishment of haircuts from time to time, then we still can't say that our life is a happy life.</p>
<p>Some people argue that haircutting is the most suitable time to evoke your most pleasant imaginations, because at this time, no one will come to disturb and stop your train of thought. I have tried this argument many times, but found that the atmosphere inside is not suitable for imagining anything. When scissors and razors dance all over your face, all that is evoked are terrible thoughts. When your heart is overcome with terror, you naturally cannot think of anything sweet and happy.</p>
<p>Others suggest that you concentrate on reading the tabloid's gossip news to reduce the aversion to haircuts. Undoubtedly, this is a good suggestion, but for people with impaired vision like me, I can hardly read anything without glasses, and whenever I get a haircut, the barber always insists on taking off my glasses before starting.</p>
<p>Some people also suggest that when the barber is giving you a haircut, you can close your eyes and take a nap. Indeed, it is common to see a few customers napping in the barbershop. Although I also like to take a nap very much, I dare not completely entrust my head to the barber's care. I would rather stay awake so that if anything goes wrong with my head, I can notice it without being unaware. In addition, drowsiness is contagious. If I fall asleep, the barber cannot resist my influence, and then you can easily imagine what a terrible result that would be. Furthermore, barbershops nowadays have both male and female customers. The barber is not a person without emotions. When he is cutting your hair, he may often cast his gaze at your beautiful neighbor to satisfy his hungry eyes. In this situation, the danger to your head is doubled. Therefore, I think it is both cautious and smart not to nap in the barbershop.</p>
<p>After lamenting the many inconveniences and pains of haircuts, sometimes I have no choice but to look at bald people with envy. However, strangely, when a person discovers that his hair is thinning, he immediately goes to the pharmacy to buy a bottle of tonic that helps hair growth, as if baldness is a great misfortune in a person's life. If baldness is indeed a hindrance to a person's appearance, then I think bald people at least have one consolation, because they don't have to bother themselves with frequent haircuts like others.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Reflections After Seeing "Sai Jinhua" <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Dian</p>
<p>"Sai Jinhua" has been staged, but until now, no one has given it a correct evaluation. Some people say that this play has lost its theme; others say that this play has even produced two themes; the scriptwriter himself says that this is a "historical allegorical drama." — That is to say: the author stated his attitude in writing this script, focusing not on the theme of the play, but on extracting stories from history and adding "allegory" aimed at reality.</p>
<p>Audiences have a kind of hot</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>and spicy feeling after watching "Sai Jinhua." This "feeling" is not a direct stimulation of the images in the play, but rather a kind of enlightenment as if silently. Therefore, regardless of the shortcomings of the play itself, such as the lack of a clear theme, the lack of concrete characterization, the loose organization, and the unskilled acting, it is only because the "theme" that the play wants to express is being borrowed to express and satirize reality. Therefore, the play itself failed, but the task it wanted to carry out was achieved and successful.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned shortcomings, the main shortcoming of the play "Sai Jinhua" is that the "dialogue" is divorced from the "plot," but because the scriptwriter is only "using the subject as an excuse," the success of this play is due to several passages of dialogue that are divorced from the plot. It is these few passages of dialogue that are divorced from the plot that can give the audience a kind of silent enlightenment. Therefore, the shortcomings of this play have become the advantages of this play, and the failure of this play is also the success of this play.</p>
<p>The story of "Sai Jinhua" is nothing more than writing about the ups and downs of the life of a famous prostitute, and in the middle, it seems to say a few words of injustice for this "old and unlucky" Sai Jinhua. However, if we look at "Sai Jinhua" with this concept, it will undoubtedly make you feel disappointed. Because Sai Jinhua, who is considered the "protagonist" in this play, has not been able to express the life, personality, and various aspects of this character in a very detailed way; at best, it is only a hasty sketch of this character. Similarly, if you regard "Sai Jinhua" as a historical drama, it will not give you a satisfactory answer, because the historical facts interspersed in it are only some "unofficial histories." Also, if you regard "Sai Jinhua" as a satirical drama, then of course you will not get anything, because the satire of the story of the previous century from the perspective of modern times is equivalent to reasoning with the dead. Therefore, when you watch "Sai Jinhua," you must not forget scriptwriter Xia Yan's words: This is an "allegorical drama." Because if you forget the meaning of "satirizing the past" and "metaphoring the present," it will definitely make you feel empty and disappointed.</p>
<p>The difficult era we are in today is no less than the era of "the Eight-Nation Alliance breaking into Beijing." Sai Jinhua, who lives on Tianqiao in Beiping today, and Sai Jinhua, who lived in the West Empress Dowager's bedroom thirty-six years ago, both saw the power and rampage of the "foreign soldiers" in Beiping. Even if she wants to "be an old commoner who lives in peace" (Sai Jinhua's words in the play), Sai Jinhua will not be able to achieve this wish in this life. Sai Jinhua's sorrow is a reminder of our current difficulties.</p>
<p>At a critical moment in the survival of a nation, even a prostitute who is considered "lower class" still has national thoughts and can eliminate private prejudices (no matter what means she uses) and solve problems that ordinary people cannot solve. Today's traitors are not as good as this frustrated prostitute, and the author's satire is powerful.</p>
<p>These dead past stories are all aimed at the living reality of today. We say that the play "Sai Jinhua" does have two themes: one is the concrete theme in the play, and the other is the abstract theme on the side. This kind of expression will inevitably affect the skills in drama, making the audience unable to obtain a unified and clear understanding, but the environment is the culprit that hinders the progress of art. Although "Sai Jinhua" cannot clearly and boldly explain the current era, its "allegory" does give the audience a great stimulation and impulse.</p>
<p>The performance of "Sai Jinhua" also tells us about the current distress of the Chinese art world: due to the stimulation of reality, they rushed from the palace of art to the crossroads. They have a lot to say, but for various reasons, they cannot say it, and they can only hold it in their throats. However, they know that the era of danger is coming, and they cannot remain silent. They can only disguise themselves and "use the subject as an excuse." This "detour" method will undoubtedly make them commit disloyalty to art itself. The main shortcomings of "Sai Jinhua" are the result of this "detour." In every turbulent era in the past, the progress of art will inevitably encounter this kind of resistance, but from the perspective of the art world itself, today's symbol of distress is also the prelude to the bright future.</p>
<p>This symbol of distress can be said to be a general phenomenon in the art world today. The "allegorical" expression techniques like the play "Sai Jinhua" are the product of this distress. If we can fully utilize this allegorical technique and break out of the atmosphere of distress, it may not be a very important help to the national liberation work of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Industry Survey</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Women's Shoe Industry in Little Garden <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Beichen</p>
<p>I believe that friends residing in Shanghai, at least, know a little about the women's shoe stores in Little Garden, right?</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why women's shoe stores in Little Garden have such a clear recognition among Shanghai friends is not because they specialize in women's shoes, but because there are so many of them, making it impossible not to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>However, since the opening of the first women's shoe store in Little Garden, it has only been about thirty years. The first one opened was called Taiyuanxiang, followed by Dalu, Sheng Taichang, and Empress, but as of now, there are no fewer than thirty to fifty women's shoe stores in the Xiaohuayuan Zhejiang Road Guangxi Road area!</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai War, their target customers were prostitutes in "book rooms" (brothels). After the failure of "book rooms" after the war, dance halls flourished, and their target customers became dancers, as well as middle and upper-class ladies, because they loved beautiful things. A pair of shoes, when worn by them, would be considered unwearable after at most half a month. As for lower-middle-class women? They are not qualified to patronize! Even if they patronized once for some reason, naturally, they would be reluctant to wear them. Often, a pair of shoes would be worn for more than a year. Therefore, regardless of the boss or the shop assistants, they would not necessarily show any welcome when this type of customer came to patronize their store.</p>
<p>The women's shoe stores in Little Garden before the Shanghai War were in their golden age, but after the end of the war, they had simply reached a period of decline. Now, let me first explain the situation in the women's shoe stores before the Shanghai War:</p>
<p>A double-front women's shoe store with good business averaged three to four hundred yuan in sales per day, while those with poor business averaged one to two hundred yuan; a single-front store with good business also had one hundred and several tens of yuan, while those with poor business had seventy to eighty yuan. The prices of the shoes sold varied, depending on the size of the store. First-class women's shoe stores sold satin embroidered shoes for about two yuan and forty cents per pair, second-class for two yuan and twenty cents, and third-class for two yuan. High-heeled leather shoes had a minimum price of six or seven yuan and a maximum of more than ten yuan. Felt flannel warm shoes, which cost one yuan and thirty or forty cents, would be sold for four yuan. In total, the average profit on shoes was at least 40%. Assuming that this women's shoe store had daily sales of two hundred yuan, then after deducting expenses, it could earn fifty yuan per day. Because it was so easy to make money, the number of women's shoe stores in Little Garden gradually increased.</p>
<p>The loss of revenue of women's shoe stores after the end of the Shanghai War was naturally affected by the economic downturn. Embroidered satin shoes fell from two yuan and forty cents to one yuan (although the cost was slightly lower than before, the difference was still too great). Some stores were selling them for ninety cents, with only a few cents of profit. Selling a pair of high-heeled shoes, on the other hand, would result in a loss of two yuan. Felt shoes also only had thirty or forty cents of profit. However, this was only if the shoes were sold as soon as they were made. If the shoes were left in the store for some time and the style was out of date, even selling them at half price would rarely attract buyers.</p>
<p>Each women's shoe store has more than a hundred styles of women's shoes, each style has seven or eight sizes, and each size has four or five pairs. Therefore, each store has four to five thousand to more than ten thousand pairs of women's shoes. Assuming that each pair costs one yuan, then the capital of a store is four to five thousand yuan or more than ten thousand yuan. But the world now is a modern world. Perhaps something that is considered new this month will be out of date next month. Therefore, women's shoe merchants dare not manufacture various styles of shoes as much as possible, fearing that they will lose money if they cannot sell them all because they are out of date. But the result is that when customers want a certain style of shoe, they are met with a shortage of goods, so the women's shoe industry in Little Garden has failed under this situation!</p>
<p>The shop assistants in the women's shoe stores, who are closely related to the women's shoe merchants, are currently living in even more difficult circumstances. Their treatment, in addition to their wages, includes a 1% commission for each pair of shoes sold. In the past, a shop assistant could usually earn about ten yuan a month in commissions, but now sometimes they can't even earn two or three yuan! At the same time, in order to save expenses, various shoe stores are implementing layoffs and salary reductions. They are worrying about unemployment every day!</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>In the past, during the heyday of women's shoe stores, the shop assistants were very arrogant. Even when a customer had already entered the store, they would not stand up. Now, as long as a passerby glances at the display window, they will come out to greet them. This situation is quite miserable!</p>
<p>At present, many women's shoe stores that have ceased operations have court seals affixed to their doors. A few days ago, the writer happened to pass by Little Garden and discovered that Taiyuanxiang, which had pioneered the women's shoe industry in Little Garden, had also closed down. After returning home, a wave of thoughts flooded my mind! "Is the Shanghai Bund really going to collapse?"</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e189">Siam on the Pacific <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— He Guangrui</p>
<p>Siam was originally a relatively ancient country in Asia. It had relations with China as early as the Three Kingdoms period. After the Sui and Tang dynasties, it became a vassal state of our country. In the Ming dynasty, it was conquered by Zheng He, and overseas Chinese were able to hold official positions here. In the Qing dynasty, it was destroyed by Burma, and later Hua Zheng Zhao restored the country and called himself the King of Siam. Judging from this historical fact, it can be seen that Siam has a deep relationship with our country. However, during the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the Qing dynasty, the forces of British and French imperialism invaded Siam, plundered its land, and divided its borders into two major spheres of influence. From then on, not only was the deep relationship between Siam and China severed, but also the Chinese compatriots living in Siam were often subjected to unreasonable oppression and exclusion. At the same time, although Siam was able to survive under the contention of the two tigers of Britain and France and was not destroyed, and was able to maintain the signboard of an "independent kingdom" on the surface, in reality, it had already become a semi-colony and one of the main places of competition among the great powers on the Pacific Ocean. Now, due to the development of the world crisis and the increasing seriousness of the problem of re-division of colonies, Siam, as a semi-colony, is of course a place of attention in the great powers' struggle for hegemony on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The country with the greatest influence in Siam is Britain. Economically speaking, British capital occupies the main monopolistic position here. Whether it is trade, banking, railways, or other capitalist enterprises, it can be said that they are all in the hands of Britain. In order to more concretely understand the problem, let's look at the trade situation between Britain and Siam in 1931 and 1932 during the period of panic (unit: Tai Jial, eleven Tai Jial is one pound)——</p>
<p>According to this fact, it can be seen that Britain occupies an absolutely dominant position in Siam's trade. Siam's main products are rice, teak, and tin, but most of these things are absorbed by Britain. Among them, grain exports to Britain account for 66%, and teak exports to Britain account for 50%. Between 1931 and 1932, Siam exported 11,293,563 Tai Jial of silver overseas, but 10,179,772 Tai Jial of it was exported to Britain. In this way, we can say that the entire economic life of Siam is in the hands of Britain. As for politics, British imperialism also has great control over Siam. It not only uses economic power to influence Siam's politics, but also can directly instigate everything from India, Hong Kong, and Singapore.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, Britain has encountered new powerful enemies in Siam, namely Japan in the Far East. Under the continental and marine policies, Japan is fiercely advancing to the northwest, looking for its "way out" on the mainland of China; on the other hand, it is using Taiwan and the South Seas mandated territories as a basis to develop southward. As a result, the South Seas and Fujian and Guangdong in China have become areas of Japanese activity; Siam is an important area on the Pacific Ocean, and it is a semi-colony that has not yet been swallowed exclusively by a certain "imperialism," which is of course what those who exercise Japanese marine policy are paying attention to. Under this attention, what is first manifested is the dumping of cheap Japanese goods in Siam. According to statistics, in the past year alone, the goods imported from Japan to Siam were worth 40 million yen. It is truly surprising that Siam, a small country with very weak purchasing power, sold so many Japanese goods. At the same time, most of the cotton produced in Siam is also purchased by Japan, which has greatly affected the cotton exported by the United States to the Far East. However, what is particularly noteworthy in Japan's active offensive against Siam is that Japan has obtained the special right to dig the Kra Canal in Siam.</p>
<p>Looking at a map of Siam, you can see that there is a narrow piece of land in Surat Province in Lower Siam, which is located between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Gulf of Siam to the east. Following the Malay Peninsula down is Singapore, Britain's economic and military stronghold on the Pacific Ocean. If this place can be navigable, it is truly an essential route for Eurasian transportation. Now, because the Kra Canal has not yet been dug, ships from Europe must detour through Singapore. If the Kra Canal is dug, then the Bay of Bengal and Siam can be directly navigable, shortening the voyage between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean by three days, which would make Singapore a defunct port, and Kra would replace it and become an essential route for Eurasian transportation. At the same time, after the Kra Canal is dug, Japan can also establish new military bases here to threaten the US Philippines, the British Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as India, Myanmar, and other places, causing serious threats to the United Kingdom and the United States on the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, when the news that Japan had obtained the special right to open the Kra Canal came out, people in London were greatly shocked. Conservative Party member Ryder said in the Lower House: "The matter of Siam opening the Kra Canal must be given great attention, because Japan's participation in this undertaking provides economic assistance." It can be seen how much Britain values this issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, Japan's political activities in Siam are also very active. It not only shouted slogans such as "driving out the oppression of the white ghosts," "liberation of the yellow race," and what "Oriental paradise" to deal with Britain, but also implemented its habitual plan there, organizing "pro-Japanese" groups in an attempt to further develop its power in Siam.</p>
<p>If Japan is a new powerful enemy that Britain has encountered in Siam, then France can be said to be its old enemy. We already know that the first countries to invade Siam were Britain and France, and therefore the first countries to fight in Siam were also them. Looking at it from a geographical perspective, it can be seen that French Annam is on the east side of Siam, British Burma is on the northwest side, and British Malaya is connected to Lower Siam on the south side. In other words, Siam is surrounded by the two major forces of Britain and France. In other words, the forces of Britain and France show an irreconcilable confrontation in Siam. Now, although France cannot deal with the East with great force due to the tense situation in Europe, it has not neglected Siam; at the same time, London has not relaxed its attention to it. In the past, the King of Siam visited Annam and expressed special goodwill to France, which aroused great suspicion in Britain; therefore, after the King returned to Siam, Britain instigated pro-British elements in Siam to protect and expand its rights in Siam. This one thing alone can show the general situation of the infighting between Britain and France in Siam.</p>
<p>British imperialism has already been severely hit by Japan in China's commodity sales and raw material markets, and has been overwhelmed by the United States in the monetary war in the Far East. The reason why it can still occupy an important position in the Pacific Ocean is because the economic, political, and military importance of Hong Kong and Singapore has not been lost. However, Siam has a very close relationship with Singapore and Hong Kong. If its rights in Siam are seized by Japan, then Singapore will become a defunct port, and the security of Hong Kong will be impossible to maintain. Therefore, British imperialism is in danger of being expelled from the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, in the Pacific hegemony war, Britain attaches great importance to Siam; on the one hand, it is actively strengthening the Singapore naval port, preparing for the "final solution" of the Pacific problem - armed resolution, and on the other hand, it is working hard to make the Bangkok (capital of Siam) government completely obey London's control in order to prevent the development of Japanese and even French forces. But in fact, Siam's recent pro-Japanese tendency is very strong, which makes the old British very uneasy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, due to the intensified offensive of the great powers, not only is the country of Siam increasingly losing its independent status, but also the lives of the eight million people of Siam are becoming increasingly impoverished. Therefore, the anti-imperialist and anti-proxy sentiments of the general public in Siam are very high, and unrest is almost everywhere. For this reason, the King of Siam has specially visited British Malaya and French Annam to conclude political and economic reciprocal agreements in an effort to quell the domestic resistance movement.</p>
<p>Now Siam's fate is twofold: either it will become a battlefield for the great powers' Pacific hegemony, or the national liberation movement will succeed and the country will become independent. But no matter what, as long as the current situation in Siam changes, the Pacific situation will also change.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Busy for Oranges <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, my hometown still looked like a country bumpkin. There were no roads, no cars, and even fewer dignitaries and their cloud-like followers coming to tour around. Therefore, after the autumn season, almost all the streets and alleys were filled with orange stalls. Speaking of these orange stalls, they can truly be regarded as a work of art: a long plank, leaning against the snow-white high walls of a spacious residence, piled with vermilion-like bright red oranges. The way these oranges are piled is not like the monotonous way Shanghai fruit stores do it, using wooden boxes arranged neatly, which looks very flat. The way they are piled depends on the size of the stall: large ones are often piled into famous mountains and peaks, with rolling hills and towering rocks, looking as if ten thousand mountains are rushing, and startled rocks are bursting; small ones are piled into beautiful pavilions, exquisite pagodas, and so on. In the evening, these peaks and pagodas are lit with small orange lamps. Looking from a distance, the powdered walls reflect a faint red light, and the shadows reflect an undulating, uncertain expanse of vermilion. Late at night, a gentle breeze blows, and the lamp shadows sway, as if these faint lights are listening to the distant barking of dogs, looking somewhat dazed.</p>
<p>Orange lamps, like the stall's furnishings, rely on the intelligence and skill of the orange seller. Some lamps are truly exquisitely made: they select the best-shaped and reddest oranges, dig a small hole in the top, and try to take out the flesh inside little by little, leaving only the entire undamaged orange peel. Then, they carve various patterns of holes in the peel with a knife, sometimes turning up small pieces of the peel to reveal the light real inner peel inside. Only then do they pour in half of a dish of vegetable oil, press two or three stems of lampwick with small coins, and light them up to become a very beautiful orange lamp.</p>
<p>The oranges in my hometown are not sold until the orange peel is completely red. Therefore, there is no such thing as the terrible appearance of the Shanghai orange merchant when the oranges first come out, thinking that the goods are rare and desperately "gouging." When the orange peel is completely red, the orange yield is naturally considerable. At that time, almost all the ships drifting on the river are orange ships. Families with large populations and many children often go directly to the boatmen on the river to buy them, not counting the number, but only how much money per load (that is, one dan). After buying them home, adults and children always eat so much that they can't even eat rice. During this time when oranges fill the market, the flesh is not valuable; what is valuable is the orange peel, the orange seeds, and the fibers attached to the flesh. It is said that these three things can be used as medicine and are my hometown's major export goods every year. Therefore, if you buy ten oranges, eat the flesh, and then take the orange peel to the orange stall, you can exchange it for eight or nine pieces of flesh without peel or fibers. If you don't want to exchange for orange flesh, selling it for cash is also no problem.</p>
<p>The orange yield increases with the winter climate: the colder it gets, the more oranges there are on the market, starting from the end of autumn in the previous year and gradually decreasing until mid-spring of the next year. Therefore, during the New Year, every household, in addition to offering three animals and nine products in front of the ancestors or family gods, also has a plate of heavily stacked bright red oranges and a plate of amber-colored oranges (that is, pomelos). When children come to pay New Year's greetings, in addition to rewarding them with peanuts, sweets, and cash, they are also given a few selected oranges. Oranges, because of their large production, everyone always tries to consume them in various ways. In addition to the several types of consumption mentioned above, everyone also makes them into "orange soup," squeezes them into "orange cakes," and makes them into "orange pastries." It is said that orange soup can sober you up, orange cakes can cure tuberculosis, and orange pastries can "regulate qi," specializing in treating stomach pain. I have not tested whether these have these effects. No matter what Chinese people do, they always have to find a legitimate excuse. In addition, if you have a cough, you dig a hole in the top of the orange, pour in a little sesame oil, and put it on the fire to bake. When the orange is roasted until it is charred and the flesh is completely permeated with sesame oil, it is peeled off and eaten. It is said that this is also a good "simple prescription."</p>
<p>My hometown has more than seventy counties, and almost every county produces oranges, largely because the climate and soil throughout the province are similar. An orange grove often occupies two or three hundred li. I heard that anyone is very free to go to the grove to play and admire, and is never subject to any restrictions, because according to the rules of the grove, tourists are allowed to pick and eat, but they cannot take them away. This is truly the difference between a big family and a small family compared to the laws of various American countries, which stipulate that the orchard owner can shoot to death passers-by who pick fruit! In my hometown, there is also a rule that if oranges protrude from the walls of the grove, even if passers-by want to pick them and take them away, the grove owner cannot interfere.</p>
<p>The planting of oranges is very simple. As long as the climate and soil are suitable, putting down the seeds (that is, orange seeds) will always allow them to grow. However, from the time the seeds are put in to the time the fruit is produced, it takes a long time. Therefore, there is a saying in my hometown: "Peaches take three years, plums take four years, and oranges take eight years." In short, oranges are a product of the temperate zone. The warmer the climate, the faster they grow and the better the quality of the fruit. In countries such as Italy, orange trees can be expected to bear fruit in three to five years, and the fruit produced is much sweeter than those in my hometown.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, every winter, we were busy with oranges, making lamps, pressing cakes, and boiling sugar, without a moment of peace. This winter, twenty years later, when I went home, I could no longer see any of this phenomenon. The streets already had Shanghai-style fruit stores, and what they sold were actually large boxes of "Yantai apples," "American oranges," "Siamese pomelos," "American grapes"...! The oranges produced in my hometown, like those in fruit stores in Shanghai, were placed on small stalls in front of the store along with those unpopular mountain potatoes and radish heads! To see oranges alone, unless in the hands of peddlers who scream hoarsely late at night, selling along the streets, these are specially sold to laborers who rest at night to relieve the scorched feeling after smoking opium.</p>
