<h3>我官方宣布　仍恃自力防共　無須與第三者協商　俄擬停止對日談判　英美法反對德日協定</h3>
<p>（南京）關於德日締結協定事、我國官方表示、德日締結同盟、傳說已逾二年、世界各國，無不深切注意、二十五日夕、德日政府將兩國所簽訂之所謂共同防共協定、正式公佈、此事眞相、乃逐漸明瞭、公佈之協定僅三條、議定書三條、是否尙有其他的定、不得而知、就已公佈之協定內容言、主旨在於共同防共、德日之間、是吾確有聯合防共之必要、乃該兩國之自身問題、我國過去雖受赤禍甚深、但經政府連年之取締與剿撫、共匪已漸次肅淸、今後防共工作、政府深信可恃自力應付裕餘，且純屬內政問題、無待與任何第三者協商之必要也、（二十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間報紙所登載及一般推測、各國對日德協定之反響、可如下述、英國向以維持現狀爲其傳統政策、並堅决反對任何集團、故望其對該協定表示好戚、自不可能、且英國認該協定直接影饗其在東亞之利益、故不得不予以嚴重之關切、英國雖將避免對該協定公開反對、但將以組織法西斯集團足以危害世界和平爲理由、表示强烈之不滿、至法國對於日德協定、或將變成日德同盟一層、歞懷疑慮、且因法蘇間有互助公約之存在、法國對任何國家之與德國組織集團者、均視爲危險之事、美國方面之反響、迄今祇國務决長穆爾曾有批評、卽謂美國對日德恊定、並無切膚關係云、一般預料英法美三國處於共產及反共產集團之間、輒設法緩和雙方之嫌隙、今茲之協定、勢必使此種嫌隙益趨擴大尖銳、則英法美三國自必加以反對云、傳羅馬接日德締結恊定之消息、表示歡忭、意國各報謂、意德旣已成立反共諒解、則意國自非日德協定第二條所稱之第三國、此間對中國之態度、傳說紛紜、但可歸納爲中國將維持不屈服不挑釁之原則、同時並注視英法美及其他中立國家之態度云、（二十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）此間已獲有證明文件、發覺德日兩國、除昨日公布之反共協定外、更締結一種秘密條約、此事已引起蘇俄各界更進步之忿怒、衆信蘇俄現與日本進行之數起交涉、或將悉行取消、例如近在東京進一行設立蘇「滿」邊境委員會之談判、以及最近北樺太油田之讓予等、自皆在廢止之列、蘇俄當局已通知日本、拒絕簽訂漁業協定、目下蘇俄各領袖、因蘇聯全國代表大會正在開會、備極忙迫、對於德日協定、恐無暇發表任何正式宣言云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國各界均懷疑日德反共協定、除所公布之條件外、必尙有餘文、或將如氷山然、其存於水底者、必較現於水面者更大也、惟消息靈通方面對於日德已商定防守軍事同盟之說、尙未接到徵實消息、此說如果確實、則英國在遠東之地位、當然將减弱矣、倫敦現頗信兩國訂有以貨易貨之協定、日本將以其原料易德國之武器、就公布之條件而觀、此間人士咸覺該恊定並未變更大局、而爲兩國爲政治原因復聯舊好之一種宣布、但不列顚終厭惡此種協定、因共足以助長對抗集團制、此種分野、殊與英首相鮑爾溫外相艾登時常說明之政策相背馳也、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）代理國務總理摩爾今日宣稱、美國對於日德反共恊定、僅以學者的眼光注意及之云、此間消息靈通各界皆謂、該恊定與美日·美俄美德之邦交、並無何種影響、外交界視此恊定德國對於俄法互助恊定爲之報復、其事實早已存在、今日過形諸文字耳、說者謂意政府猶預參加該協定者、因意國現仍爲國聯會員、而德日則吾也、法國駐美大使今日曾躬至美國務院遠東事務局、大的乃探詢美國對該協定之反響、至史丹林於宣布新憲法時、曾痛詆法西斯主義、故該協定之簽字、一般人士予以特別注意、午後各報多以大字標題登載此項消息、同時得悉新任美國駐俄大使台維斯原定先在故里休假若干時、再行赴任、今决定立卽啟程云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長台爾博斯頃在國務會議發表演說、陳述國際局勢之梗槪、對于德日兩國簽訂防共協定、表示憂慮、認此項恊定、不足爲德俄兩國關係之改善、造成有利空氣、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間官方今日發表意見、以爲德日協定、將使國際權勢之平衡、更見移轉於德國方面、故法國安全之危機、恐有增加之勢、該協定更將迫使法國設法與英美兩國謀親善、法官方對於法美兩國在國際事務上能密切合作一點、頗具希望、並鄭重聲言、此項協定對於太平洋之海軍國、或有種種可能之影響、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間負責方面稱、意政府不爲日德反共協定所動、又稱、羅馬東京兩方雖見解相同、但並無的文存在、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>桐油出口統制與對外關係</h3>

<p>在日德同盟問題引起了中國及世界公憤的時候。上海神經過敏的外國報紙。把中國政府統制桐油出口的傳說。輕輕地牽入了這個問題上面去。據字林西報的說法。中國有統制桐油的企圖。乃是上了德國人的當。德國想用破爛了的機械。換取中國的最好原料如鐵砂桐油等。再用他的槍砲炸藥。向日本換滿洲的大豆。德國設法帮助遠東的侵略國。這個侵略國。是中國的公敵。也是德國的同盟國。中國在這個時候。把英美等友好國家所需要的桐油等。從友好國家人民的資本所經營的出口業手中奪過去。歸政府來支配。這是十分不智的計晝。字林西報說中國政府幸而還沒有實行這個統制計劃。如果實行。「將給外國人以很壞印象。尤其是英美兩國。英國消耗中國出口桐油百分之十六。美國容納百分之七十一。這兩個國家的輿論。將有反威。因而减少了這兩個國家對中國的善意同合作。」</p>
<p>我們認爲硬生生的把桐油問題。拖到日德同盟問題上面去。利用我們對於日德同盟的忿怒。來阻止政府建設國防經濟的重要計劃。是很不智的。我們知道桐油出口佔中國出口。物第一位。而這個原料。又是全世界絕對缺乏。有專利性質的。其市塲日益擴大。對於中國的經濟。有生死關係。决不許長久落在幾個外國資本家之手。而政府無支配權利。政府統制桐油出口。是一回事。統制後對於這個原料怎樣處分。又是一回事。英美是我們的友邦。也需要我們的桐油。我們自然不至於禁止桐油對這些國家輸出。德國也需要我們的桐油。如果德國遠東政策不利我國。甚至於侵犯我們主權。我們便要禁止供給他們桐油。給與不給。大權在我。至於英美德日等國私人在桐油出口業及栽培業上的投資。政府自然會設法使其損失减到最小。如果一口咬着蔣委員長「鼓勵外資」的話。以爲外人在華投資絕對神聖不可侵犯。這是太自私自利。而太沒有顧到中國民族的利益了。</p>
<p>在德國海通社帶官塲性質的聲明上（二十二日本報）也曾提到滿洲的大豆。是德國人民的必需品。德國不得不用機器及藥品同日本交換。看來用德國軍火換取滿洲大豆。是件事實。雖然德國方面否認用軍火交換。果然如此。德國的遠東政策。非常錯誤。拿去我們滿洲的大豆。却用坦克車毒氣給侵略我們的國家。我們是不能容忍的。我們贊成政府統制桐油出口。利用這個經濟武器。在平時可以改善我們在國際貿易上的地位。在戰時可以給侵略國以制裁。我們反對爲顧全少數外人的私利。而延擱我們民族利益有關的政策。最近李滋羅斯爵士對英國人說「目下的危險。不在中國進步之太遲。而實在其企圖進展之太速。」我們惟恐中國進展之不速。我們爲建設民族的經濟基礎。應無任何顧忌地向前邁進。</p>

<h3>日德協定原因　挽回自身孤立　並包圍蘇俄</h3>
<p>（東京）據日本政治觀察家之意見、日德反共恊定目的之一、乃在使兩國取得更密切之合作、以圍攻蘇聯、日本希望加蘇聯西睡以壓力、可免除其在遠東方面所予日本之威脅、因此日本對蘇聯將取更積極更堅强之步驟、迨爲勢所必至、蘇聯對日本之仇恨、亦將因以增加、是卽將來之危險、必較目前爲允甚、至就中國關係言之、中蘇之將益趨密切、或亦意料中事、而日英美間將來之關係、亦不能保證樂觀、蓋日本已予英美兩國以日本將加入法西斯陣綫之印象也、觀察家又指出目前之協定、顯示日本自廢止英日同盟後所採取之投機政策及滿洲事件以還所採取之孤立政策、均將予以根本變更、而劃一新時代、以確定之目標、積極推行其大陸政策云、（二十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日文報紙今日對日德反共協定、均抱鎭靜股憂而疑慮之態度、頗爲顯着、關於各日文報紙所表示之反響、中央社特派員所得印象、可如下述、（一）各報幾一致堅望日政府應嚴密的束、勿踰越協定所公佈之範圍之外、對任何有同盟集團嫌疑之行動、應予避免、並以最大之努力、消釋因協定簽訂而發生之種種誤會、（二）關於對蘇聯之關係、允應予以改善、勿因此而使關係惡化、（三）日外務省之聲明、雖謂目前之協定、非欲組織任何集團、但日本之政治傾向、是否更法西斯化、或國社主義化、極爲可疑、（四）許多報紙均置問關於需要德國協助防共一層、是否全屬必須、（五）一般對日本因與德國提携而放棄自主外交政策、或將使日本將來國策之實行、發生阻礙一層、表示股憂、（二十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日德兩國訂立防共協定、日本各界對此見解如决、</p>
<p>民政黨總務櫻內談曰、日德協定目的爲防北共產黨勢力之侵入、並非以蘇聯或其他特定國爲目標、日本與有同一目的之各國、共同防共、係當然之事、</p>
<p>政友會幹事長安藤曰、日德兩國訂立協定、有兩種重大理由、日本由孤獨外交、轉向連繫外交、此其一、共產主義之思想與其政治機構爲其二、協定之範圍僅止於防共、並非視蘇聯爲敵國、凡我國民、應諒知國交爲萬邦一視、社會大衆黨麻生書記長曰、日本自滿洲事變以來、在世界孤立、在獨自立塲、實行防共、日本應保守此立塲、積極防共爲要財界意見、日德恊定之成立、將來能使與各國共同防共氣運有力、並得促進對各國之親善關係、今决協定、又可促進日滿與德之貿易關係、日本現在充實軍備、各種軍事工業必要擴張之際、由德國輸入機械類、必要增加其數、其他產業上之技術的提携、亦必能帶來好結果、（二十六日同盟電）</p>
<h3>有田外相得意　欣然擁抱希特勒像　日本各報評論協定得失</h3>
<p>（東京）外相有田在官邸接得柏林電話、聆悉日德反共協定已經簽字、卽欣然舉德元首希特勒之肯像一幀、而擁諸懷、日外務省　員會開宴慶祝、英國駐日大使克萊武及美代辦亦被邀至外務省、吿以是項協定業經簽字、並予以協定文件、日本報界均注意英美兩國對該協定之反響、朝日新聞載稱、在該協定未完成之前、日本曾說明其眞正意志、並覓求英美兩國之諒解、蓋恐兩國遽斷爲日本已加入法西斯集團也、該報又稱、英國拒絕表示意見、但一般空氣殊反對是項恊定、一部份英人認此直接有關英國在遠東之利益、但令人注意者、卽日德兩國自退出國聯後、在國際上已陷於孤立地位、而今已放棄孤立、以共同安全担保方式、向堅固的國際合作前進一步矣云、日日新聞載稱、該協定之目的在對蘇俄組織一種包圍之勢力、俾可使日本或德國、對蘇俄可採取一種强硬政策、日本目下對於蘇俄遠東軍隊之威脅、已可不復顧慮、以上形勢、似卽爲日本對蘇俄採取積極强硬政策之結果、該報又云、日外務省之本意、原以爲此項協定成立後、日本與他國之齟齬、或可有相當减少、恐實際上未必如此、今後日本外交關係前途之荆棘、正方興未艾、消息靈通方面以爲日德協定締結之後、或將使中俄兩國轉趨親善、同時日本希望與英美增進友誼關係之努力、恐亦未必能順利達到、現時日本對於英日同盟廢止後、外務省所採用之機會主義及倚牆政策、必須暫時加以放棄、而改用一種眞實建設及自主的外交政策、向前邁進云、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）宣傳部畏郭培爾頃由無綫電播音、宣讀本日德日兩國所訂「反共產國際」協定全文、决復代表希特勒元首及德國政府、誦讀宣言、略謂「德日兩大國、茲互相携手毅然、决然官佈對於赤色亂黨抱定不退讓不屈服之堅决態度、抑此項恊定僅屬一種防衛性質之行動、實乃顯而易見、蓋德日兩簽的國、並未向共產國際挑戰、惟共產國際、用各種革命與叛亂之挑釁方法、謀在全世界、造成災禍與恐慌、故兩簽的國、不得不加以防範耳、共產國際之趨向、足使整個文明世界、受嚴重之威脅、並使各民族最神聖之德性、遭其非法玩弄、幸而德意志與德國民族、今已充分堅固、不至爲布爾希維克主義所摧毁、溯自希特勒元首秉政以來、莫斯科之赤色國際、曾用各種手段、謀恢復其在德國所喪失之地位、且向全世界挑撥煽惑、以使全世界人民、羣起以反對德國、降至今日、共產國際、倘有機可乘、猶欲發動反國社黨之神聖戰爭、以殱滅德國而後快、惟此種包圍德國之企圖、已先後歸於失敗、德國邊疆、現有强大軍隊、加以守衛、彼共產國際、一旦侵犯吾國、吾人必毅然决然、加以擊退、甚且施以撻伐、此層在紐倫堡國社黨大會中、吾人業已言之、最近西班牙事變、允足顯示、擴張反布爾希維克鬥爭之必要、由是可見、此次兩大文明國所訂之協定、其目的乃在廓淸共產國際之殘暴企圖、當知德日兩民族、不欲向他國挑釁、但亦不容許他國之挑釁也」云云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國輿論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨各報對於德日恊定成立消息、似尙鎭定、其評論隨黨派而異其詞、晨郵報謂所公布之全文、毫無特殊震耳之點、此不外乎一種相互提携、以遏制共產國際惡意的活動之質言耳、每日導報視該協定爲法西斯對蘇聯露骨的攻擊、更趨前之威脅步驟、並謂該協定整個態度、一言以蔽之日、侵略而已、每日電聞謂、該協定若非有隱秘之條欵、則殊乏重要關係、至於其重要伏於氣質、內容猶其决也、泰晤士報謂該協定條欵之公布、已减輕因秘密引起之恐懼、協定中並未述及蘇俄、其反共宣言之措詞、使蘇俄對於相映以拒惡意活動之眞實意志「結爲夫婦」、殊難加以反對、該報又謂外間謠傳該協定在荷屬東印度劃定德日經濟勢力範圍、終將轉成政治勢力範圍、此種發展、將使英國在香港與新加坡之地位受有反響、此說大的非全無因、該報結語日、此種發展、無論其是否在蓄謀之中、個日本對華之侵入、似將因德日協定而大增其速度該協定已大减日本關於滿洲邊界之憂懼矣、孟却斯德指導報謂日德協定中最重要而最可慮之部分、爲其第二節、文中獨用「國外」樣、已消滅一般人以爲此協定乃防衛性質之一切推想、取嚴峻計劃」、以制彼間接爲第三國際工作之語、足以包括自干涉西班牙內戰至公然攻擊捷克與華北等事、此協定託名反共、實則爲一種反蘇俄之協定耳、最聰慧之宣傳家、亦不能展其口才、使人相信德國能「保衛」西班牙或捷克、而無非法侵略之嫌、如德國之行爲、不能確定、日本是否對俄作戰、不能斷遽、雖然日本似必將利用此機會對中國作更進一步之侵略矣、合作之威脅爲協定中最可畏之因素、此恊定以最低之估計論、固爲一種虛聲恫嚇之手筆、第在已往之兩年中虛聲恫嚇已成歐洲最强之威力矣、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>秘密條欵</h3>
<p>（倫敦）標凖晚報外交記者載稱、據可靠消息、德日兩國在柏林簽訂之「反共產國際協定」、附有秘密議定書、其大要如下、（一）將荷屬東印度羣島劃分爲德日兩國經濟勢力範圍、（二）解决戰前德國在太平洋各島屬之問題、第一項規定以爪哇海·班達海·亞拉佛拉海。作爲界錢、分劃德日兩國之經濟的勢力範圍、換言之、卽以荷屬東印度之婆羅洲與西里伯兩島、作爲日本勢力範圍、而以蘇門答臘與爪哇兩島、作爲德國之勢力範圍是也、關於第二項、聞德國聲明、對於戰前在太平洋所屬馬利亞納·加羅林·馬紹爾各羣島（按現係日本委任統治地）放棄一切權利云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日關東華北兩軍部　天津重要集會　坂垣率幕僚飛津參加　直接參戰為最後决議</h3>

<p>此次日軍重要軍人在天津會議、關東與華北兩軍部意見、在初頗有牴觸、駐華北軍部主張、對綏東問題、官適可而止、因現値華北經濟開發、安定人心之不遑、若事件擴大、均將陷於停頓、且無術可誘致華人投資、倘能維持此特殊局　面與政權存在、逐步施行、一年後可實現其理想　之事業三分之一、但日關東軍部則以爲德日同盟締結成功、不先打通內蒙消路、先發制人、則坐失機會、任令蘇聯有何辦法出現、再想對付、卽不容易、目前僞蒙軍力量薄弱、日方若不直接參加、無達到所期望鵠的之日、華北海軍武官、亦頗欲乘機建樹功續、從旁贊同此意、所以會議最終的結果、以日關東軍主張定議也、（二十五日）</p>

<p>現在『A』級外籍人員之薪水、　一部分有名為回國薪水者、得以每兩折合英余二先令六辨士、而享有滙兌損失之補價金、現兩制旣L廢除、國幣亦日臻穩固、故所謂滙兌補償金者、儘可以銀元折合、歸併於原薪之中、而回國薪水中應得之匯兌補償金、大半亦應加以取銷、依此辦法、委員金特按照每國幣一元合英金一先令二辨士八分之三、　滙兌補償金歸入原薪之中、訂定薪水新階級、然後再减去百分之八、卽作為本報吿書採納之後、外籍『A』級人員應得之薪水、再則最近新進人員、其在服務未滿五年而不享受匯兌補償金之利益、及已婚女職員之無享受補償金之資格者、其限制此後亦照常存在、</p>
<p>滙兌調　辦法</p>
<p>此後工部局人員大部分之薪給、應以銀元計算、而取銷現有之滙兌調整、但關於專家及技術人員之必須聘自外國者、為便於吸收起見、其與外國幣制之連鎖、似尙未可悉予廢除、故委員會認為現『A』級職員中、有九十餘人、有應享有滙兌調整之利益、而現有享受匯兌調整利益之『A』級人員　數、則為八百六十七人云、</p>
<p>升級加薪程序</p>
<p>委員會認為中級人員中、有加薪晋級過速之處、而現有之活動加薪辦法、亦往往使大多　獲　　高額之薪給、故新訂辦法加薪有一定之規定、等次亦應增設、如現在人員晋升一級、卽可臻該等之最高薪額者、此後應晋升五級、（每級一年）始可達最高之薪額、而現在晋升四級者、此後則須晋升六級、並於職員晋級加薪之時不得無故而獲得最　之加額云</p>
<p>退職利益</p>
<p>依現有之章程、職員每屆退職之期、　所得之利益約分積資退職金及養老金　部分、委員會對於現有辦法、並不主張更改、但因於九三一年之修正·及本報告書之採用·日後職員退職時·其大部分之利益、將為積資退職金、而養老金之重要、將日就减縮云、</p>
<p>積資退職金</p>
<p>按諸現行辦法、職員之薪水、每月扣除百分之五、作為積咨退職金、另由局方加人百分之十、其目的在鼓勵服務之忠恒、現委員會主張、此後新任職員、在人局服務最初五年之內、局方所照加之百分之十、應改為百分之五、再則現在局內外籍職員、於退職之時、其應得積資退職金之半　、得以每兩等於英金二先令六辨士折合外幣因此局方所負　之滙兌責任、極　重大、且與財政之原則不合、因之委員會主張、此後應加以取消、並因此後『A』級外籍職員之積資退職金、　根據於調整後之薪給、故彼等亦不至蒙受損失、惟現在人員、已經積聚之積資退職金上、應得之匯兌利益、則未便加以否認、因之委員會主張、在本報吿書中所建議者、施諸實行之時、各員所已有之數額、仍得按諸現行辦法、以其半數折合外幣、再則現在辦法、復准職員、於任滿一年之後、要求將其應得之積資退職金改為英金、美金·或日金·委員會主張、此條保留、惟仍須於四個月前通知局方、再則現有辦法、局方　保積資退職金之利息、國幣為六厘、外幣為五厘、此後應以上年度國幣及外幣存欵之平均利率、為該金之利息、</p>
<p>養老金之計算</p>
<p>現有養老金之計算辦法簡言之、卽為職員吿老之後、仍可獲得其最後薪額之半數、以資贍養、故最後薪額之半數、减去積資退職金上所應可獲得之利息、（以五厘計算）卽係養老金、而養老金之最高額，現為四千兩、委員會主張、此項計算之原則、不予變史、惟兩數應易以相當之元數、再則現在『A』人員、於退職之時、得選擇中國國幣或外幣之支付、委員會主張、局方此項義務、尙未便驟加取消、惟現在兩制旣已廢除、此後應以每元折台英金一先令二辨士八分之三、或國幣每百元合美金二十九元半、或日金一百另二元八分之三、預料此後積資退職金之匯兌損失補償、及此後『B』級人員之薪給上匯兌損失補償、均將取消、局方所負之匯率危險、較前當可日輕云、</p>
<p>地位之分等</p>
<p>現有工部局職員之受有聘任書者、祗分『A』級及『L』二種、現委員會主張、應再　設一『B』級、而以現在『A』級中外籍職員的七百九十三人歸入『B』級、其待遇略亞於『A』級、不享受匯率調整之利益、長假及川資之待遇、亦略有等差、並據委員會之意見、此後工部局外籍人員應儘量由本埠聘任、至『L』級人員、現有一百三十五員、此後亦應悉數由本埠聘任之云、</p>
<p>長假新章</p>
<p>按照現行章程、『A』級外籍人員、每屆五年、服務期滿、得請返國長假一决、為期七個月、往返川資及匯率補償余等、由局發給、現委員會主張、此項『A』級人員及外國聘任之『L』級人員之長假利益、應予保存、惟所謂長假匯率補償金辦法、則應略予變更、卽此後凡屬『A』級人員、一切現行長假辦法、概不更動、惟『B』級人員將來之山本埠　任及在本國無　屬者、及『L級人員、均有新訂長假辦法、此項長假期、每年加積『』級、每年三星期、『L』級每年二星期、　務人員、每年四星期、『B』及警務人員、積至五年、『L』人員、積至七年、局方得支給往返本國川資、而人員之不願返國者、得每年以應得之長假期、併入短假、（每年三星期）用去之、再則現在局內高級人員、如處長等、每四年得請長假一次、此章亦不變動、而副處長及低級主任等、於服務滿十五年後、亦得每四年請長假一次云、</p>
<p>長假滙率補償</p>
<p>依照現行辦法、職員長假期中薪給、其最初五百兩、得按每兩合英金二先令六辨士計算、現委員會主張、為體恤低級洋員起見、是項辦法、暫不取消、而以最初五百兩改為最初四百元、而以每元合一先令六辨士折算</p>
<p>返國川資</p>
<p>委員會主張、凡屬『A』級外籍人員、應享有頭等往返川資『B』及『L』級人員、二等往返川資、此等往返川資、包括其家屬在內、卽除職員本人之外、妻及子女二人之往返川資、亦由局方供給云、</p>
<p>醫藥費用委員會主張、現行醫藥章程、暫不修改、惟此　職員患病、特別治療、除因公受傷、及為診斷所必需之愛克司光照射二項之外、概須經典職委員曾特別議准之後、始得由局方負擔其費用、再則職員子女醫藥費，亦以二人為限、子女年齡男童十六歲、女童十七歲為限、</p>
<p>職員住宅房捐依照現行辦法、工部局職員住宅、俱免征巿政總捐（即巡捕捐）及地產捐、現委員會主張、此後免捐辦法、應卽停止、惟職員之寄宿於局有房屋及局方租貨之房屋中者、仍不付捐、</p>
<p>家室利益家室利益者、卽職員婚娶之後、其妻及子女得享受醫藥及返國川資等利益、現委員會主張、『B』級外籍職員須薪水在六百元以上者、及『L級職員服務滿六年、其薪水在四百元以上者、始得享受是項家室利益、惟警務及火政人員、及現在已享有家室利益之職員、此後仍得繼續享受、</p>
<p>孀婦死亡及殘廢恩給等</p>
<p>此後職員死亡、其孀婦所得之恩給、及因公殘廢所得之恩給等、此後均不再附帶匯率調率利益而『A』職員死亡之後、此後亦不再給孀婦恤金、而『B』及『L』級人員死亡之後、其孀婦之得領恤金者、亦以已經享受家室利益、及薪給不超過八白元者為限、</p>
<p>病假利益</p>
<p>此　職員服務未滿三年者、非經典職委員會之特別許可、不得享受病假中各項利益、其在東方療養者、其期限應規定為三個月、</p>
<p>長假滿期後辭職</p>
<p>凡職員於長假滿期返滬後、在未屆退休年齡之前、返滬後未滿二年、而自動辭職者、除由董事會特別允許者外、其長假期中所得之長假薪給、及其本人妻室等之　返川資、應按照返滬後服務之久暫、退還其一部份、（未完）</p>

<h3>「多摩川」頭民半日</h3>
<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>夏的季節轉眼又到牠的闌珊的階段，背着旅行囊，提着小箱篋，面龐和半裸的兩臂刻着海水和海邊的太陽所賜的褐紅的烙痕歸來的少女們，在站台上，在車箱中巳愈來愈多。她們的驕人似姿影映到我的眼中的時候，我不由不暗地裏嘆道：「今年的海水浴的夢，終又是夢了，縱已到了這個海國之都」！</p>
<p>的確，到了東京來，還沒有去過市外一步，有點「無事忙」到不像話了。海縱然與我無緣，我决心在殘夏中到近郊的有水的地方走一走，月臺上天天見到的塗着蔚藍的山，銀色的溪流，和野幕的前紅色的燎火的旅行廣吿畫，使我選擇奧多拿摩做我在日本第一次「探勝一的目的地。好容易邀了兩個朋友，坐了一個鐘頭的郊外電車，掠過一些植着樅林，桑樹和旱地農作物的田野，便到了奧多摩。我們照着導游小冊子的指示，坐着八分鐘的鐵纜車，登天似的，先到御嶽山的神社瞻禮一番。</p>
<p>山路差不多像平地一樣的平坦，穿着高牙的木屐的女人也泰然彳亍地一拖一嗑地走着，到了山腰的一個「展望台」上，向四周一望，遠處近處的無數的山在羅列俯仰着，但不是怪石嶙峋的亂山，而是密密地，織着一幅又一幅的靑綠的森林，柔潤中帶着秀挺的山之羣，在黃色的晨光中顯得有撲人的爽氣。</p>
<p>越近神社，樹越來越蒼古了，除了筆直十數丈高的樅杉之外，還有松柏盤鬱着。神社的建築不見壯麗，而且有點荒廢了。但是，最惹我們注目的，却是神社前掛着的無數的寫着「某人某人獻奉樹苗若干千若干萬株一的木牌。日本的山不是童山濯濯，當拜這些善男信女之賜不少吧。</p>
<p>在神社前徘徊了一會之後，我們便下山去訪尋一個以瀑布名的「七里瀧」，去六七路的沒人行的崎嶇小道，才聽見泠泠像古琴那樣的水聲，再下去幾步便到了有瀑布的所在。數丈飛下的鳴泉，一泓碧綠的潭水，雖已使周圍的岩石草樹沁透了幽靜的寒意，使我們也感到一縷凉味，但是規模太小了，還遠遠比不上泰山的百丈厓，廬山的黃龍潭，我們不能不失望了，特別是酷愛瀑布的我。這因為童年第一次的游踪就是印在故鄉鼎湖的飛水潭邊。濕翠欲流的枝葉交又之下，壯麗的迸濺飛奔的銀流和湛碧不見底的潭水，再添上蛟龍的故事，和關於潭的深度的荒誕的傳說，使初决的印象特別深刻地親栩地留在我的記憶裏，近年雖曾親近過不少的泉整之勝，　底總覺得沒有樣的夢境的縹渺。現在這個七里瀧更不消說了。假如奧多摩一帶都是如此，我們就未免枉此一行。</p>
<p>折回神社，尋着下山的路，打算到多摩川頭去。沿着山邊盤旋行曲的走，過了一個山頭又一個山頭，常陽的沒有蔽蔭的地方正蒸着嚴靜的正午的暑氣，轉過　幻的林蔭小路，却漾着幽涼的山風，一山已分秋夏，我們的汗衫也因而更番地濕透凉乾了。</p>
<p>到了山脚，濺濺潺潺中雜着哽咽澎湃的急響，譜出一篇悲凉的小交響曲，先隨風送到我們的耳邊來，而前面披着淡金色陽光的高林叢樹的枝間葉底，又時漏出一堆閃動晶瑩的積雪，一串顫漾的銀色的練來。我們的脚步兒不由得不放快了。</p>
<p>走到溪邊，一道夾着紅欄干的狹長的白木橋，橫在眼前，站在橋頭眺望一下，眞疑置身在一幅似曾相識的典型的東方風景　裏；亂不間的洄漩着的潔白的湍流，溪邊的密密傾欹着的深綠的楓樹，雜樹，掩映樹間的日本式的臺榭，默默地在戲着水，靠在石上凝視着水的游人，一切都似融在夏畫的無盡的靜穆中。回顧溪壑盡處有幾疊蔚藍的遠山臥着，空際浮着一堆空明的白雲，襯托得這一幅畫圖又添點幽深邈遠之致。</p>
<p>橋盡處有一個賣茶的亭子，凌空探出澗中，樹皮的房頂，不加修琢的天然的木頭斷面做成的矮桌，都很與這樣的溪山相宜，我們靠在亭子的攔邊，席地坐着，脚兒伸出攔外，寫意地懸着，在那沒有間歇地彈奏着的水的雅樂中，在那時時漾來的風的微波中，我們領略到一種輕鬆的「閒」的滋味。</p>
<p>我們繼續沿着溪邊前行，路是一條背山面溪蜿蜒着的柏油汽車路。溪流的時急時緩，陽光的乍開乍合，橋的式樣的相異，使沿路的溪壑在相似的情調中仍有參差之致。每走二三里便有標着「奇勝」「名所」一類字眼的導游廣吿牌子，我們以時間不早，不敢到處流連，到了一個名喚「鳩之巢」的時候，暮色　過早地躡足似的掩到了。但是我們的好奇心給這個有點蹊蹺的名字所吸引，不由得不　着路標的指示，向澗邊走去過了一道用板搭成的曲折的危橋，便到了澗的中間。特別歷亂　嶒的石堆，激成幾疊瀑布似的急流，急流過處，潴着一潭深碧。在薄薄浮着的空白的暮靄中，水光樹色恍惚是一幅給歲月薰暗了的古畫那樣，再顯得柔和靜穆，泉的聲響像是夢回酒醒時聽的隣家的琴箏那樣，來得縹渺。澄澈的澗水，更誘使我們把外衣袴鞋襪脫去，挿足流中，盡情消受那冰凉的快感。</p>
<p>「你瞧」，我的一個游伴帶笑呌起來，「日本的大學生到那兒也是大學生呵！」　　我向四周張望一下，看見一個帶着大學生帽子的靑年正捋高他的西裝褲子，有點超趄地往水裏走去，才走幾步，便再回到岸邊，他的四角帽子始終還覆在他的頭上。我也不禁笑起來。</p>
<p>當我正要掬水往嘴裏送的時候，刷的一聲，一條二寸多長的小魚給激湍的水花打到石上來，　滾了一下又滑下去。</p>
<p>「還有魚呢！」我喊道。　　「你現在才知道？前頭還有人在摸魚呢！」一個坐在石上凝視了許久的同伴答道</p>
<p>離我們三四丈的水中深處，果然站着一個差不多全裸的黑漢子，一手拿着一個木斗似的東西，一手大概握着魚又吧。一會把那木斗覆在面上半潛在水裏，會又再站起來。我們坐在石上留心諦看着他。隨着暮色而漸深的水聲水色釀成的冷意，使坐久了的我們的冰凉的肌膚，感到有點衣衫單薄，但是那漢子似乎還捉不到一尾的小魚。</p>
<p>「笑那大學生？我們還是五十步笑百步吧！」一個同伴似乎有所感了。</p>
<p>歸途的急行電車迎着驟緊的晚風，飛掠過灰暗的林野前進的時候，滿圓的月亮已從銀灰色的山巒上現出來。我們才恨不在多摩川頭多流連一會，做一個月夜溪山的幻夢。</p>
<h3>大人物恕不招待</h3>
<p>— 畫</p>
<h3>農民和孩</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>有一次我經過荔冷河。</p>
<p>令我驚訝的是當我經過這里的肥沃的田畝，看見那些裸體的農民仰起他們底赤紫的臉孔對着太陽吼呌，猶如被暑熱侵害的幾百條耕牛發洩牠們不能伸訴的怒氣。為什麼呢——這里平靜得像一塊綠色的書版，而他們已經從那單調的生活裏面找到他們痛苦底來源了嗎？</p>
<p>走着，我被村外的地平綫上的疏落的遠山捉住了，停下我底飢餓的脚步。山岡粗粗一看好像只有三個或四個的，但一會兒我就發現牠們後面還有露出半邊臉或尖長的腦袋，若隱若現的無數的山峯。在純藍的天空，那一爐毫無雜質的高熱度的火燄無情的冶煉之下，牠們更顯出偉大的靜默。我愛牠們到了想一步跳進牠們底懷中，用我底呌聲擾亂牠們底寗靜的地步。</p>
<p>直切着增石村底弧形的邊界的公路上有笨重的汽車，馱着穿灰色軍服的軍官的馬匹，和肩挑彈藥箱，公文箱和棹椅鍋爐的伕役在忽忽來回地走着。採柴的樵婦看見他們經過就憤怒地站在一旁朝他們楞着眼望。</p>
<p>我明白那些裸體的農民為什麽在金光燦爛的禾田裏仰起他們底赤紫的臉孔對着太陽吼呌了。他們守着那些辛苦的收穫不讓外來的侵入者，不論是饑荒的災民，流動的賊匪，或是栘防的官兵搶奪掉。難道世界上有比這種恐怖的預感更適宜於吼呌的事情麼？</p>
<p>在一間孤立的河邊的白牆房屋外面，我問兩僩小孩子：</p>
<p>「你們在害怕麽，是什麽東西呀？」</p>
<p>一個七歲大的女孩子呌阿地，一個五歲大的男孩子呌阿平。離開小縣城三四十里的這鄉下的兒童壯健靈敏得猶如生下地來不久的馬仔。姐弟們正在撇開一切和一個肥大的母鷄玩要，他們要捕捉她，跳着笑着，在地上的塵土中打滾。她慌張地躱進竹林裏，一會兒又悠然若無其事地挺着肥滿的胸膛走出來啄食地面的小蟲。孩子們一走近她，她就機警地飛撲着奔到遠遠的地方才站住了</p>
<p>「害怕什麼？我們一點都不怕！」</p>
<p>阿平回答我，但他馬上被姐姐一把揪住了。</p>
<p>阿地十分莊重地吿誡他。</p>
<p>「不要胡說！」她申斥道，「看捱摑呵……你從那里來的（她轉向我），為什麼不問我呢？我知道——我們鄉下就要開槍了。」</p>
<p>「誰開槍呀？」</p>
<p>「他們。他們到我們鄉下開槍來的。</p>
<p>「誰把這些事情吿訴你的？」我顫慄地問。</p>
<p>「誰吿訴我？我為什麽要人吿訴呢！」</p>
<p>我忍痛離開他們走出樹林外面了。</p>
<h3>題合照</h3>

<h3>讀由勤·沃尼爾戲曲雜寫（二）</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>自然在上面我所講的，我所寫的，不是對於沃尼爾的忠實介紹，而只是我個人的感情的舒發。盲人摸象，雖能吿訴人象的一條鼻，一條尾，一隻腿，一個肚皮，一隻牙的形態，可是象的整個的形狀，依然渺茫。親愛的讀者，你們得當我是一個盲人，而我所講，所寫，所刻劃的，你們也得當它是象的一鼻，一尾，一腿，一腹，一牙的形態。那末你也許可以不失望，而我也再可以寫下去。我得吿訴你們，我的最易犯的錯誤，是我所寫的文章常在我所出的題目以外，這樣的文章如果交到戴老光眼鏡的老先生手中，至少要打十下手心。讓你們也鞭策我，像戴老光眼鏡的老先生一樣，而我也約束自己，不越出題目範圍，像一個文藝學徒一樣。把話頭從範圍以外拉回範圍以內來。在這以前，我還得有個請求，讓我像煞是一個劇評家，像煞是一個懂得沃尼爾戲劇的人，而你們不要把我的假冒戳穿，不要把我的勇氣嚇走。然而就是假定這樣，我也有些自餒，我看一幕戲，我得視覺的快感，我聽一幕樂劇，我得聽覺的快感，可是我拿起筆來寫，我只有痛苦，而並無快樂。我怔視着面前的白紙，我寫些什麼呢？我從什麼地方寫呢？　是一個對我對你們都成問題的事。我們知道翻開任何一個劇本，你就發覺當中首先接觸你的眼睛的是登塲人物，那末我就捉牢這一點，先從沃尼爾的戲劇中的人物來講吧。</p>
<p>我又得學前人批評舊小說一樣，手拿了朱筆來點將。把沃尼爾劇中的人物一個個呼喚出來評論一渦，這也許是比較客觀的方法，但也是最笨拙的一種方法，同時也點不了逍許多。我現在所取的辦法，只不過把他的劇中人物，而籠統地歸類來加以說明吧了。自然這也與盲人摸象差不多。在沃尼爾的戲劇中的男角，據有些美國評論家說，有兩種相反性格的人物典型，一種是有大而黑的眼睛，瘦長帶詩人氣質敏感而內心苦　常表現於顏面上的典型，還有一種是與這種對立的典型，這典型的人有着小的藍的眼睛，同時有着結實身體，而他們的氣質是傾向實事求事的。在「天外」這一劇中，我們可以找出羅伯脫梅·的這一人物，為前者的代表。這一位人物，據沃尼爾的描寫，是：「一個高而苗條約二十三歲的少年。在他軒昂的前額及大而陰沉的眼睛上，微有詩人的表現，他的形態是纖弱與優雅，口及下頗傾向於瘦弱。」他的哥哥安德路的性格，剛巧與他對立。他被沃尼爾描寫為「年達二十七歲，是羅伯脫的反對型——鄙野，被太陽薰成赤色，有一種魁梧的男性美——土地的兒子，敏於料理事務而拙於才智。在「大神白朗（The　GreaGod　Brown）中，我們也可以找出這兩種淸楚劃分的典型存在。呈現在我們前面的劇中角色，「威廉·白朗是被描寫做「差不多十八歲高大的健美的運動員，他是白面金髮藍眼的，有着易笑的坦白快樂的面孔，牠的表情已經現示一種老練的的制。他的態度有着一種普通智力的容易自信。」從沃尼爾所描寫的「坦白快樂的面孔」，「老練的的制」，『普通的智力』，我們已可知白朗是屬於那一典型。我們再看下去，我們看釗劇中主角「狄翁。安東尼一。「他是像年靑的白朗一樣高長，但瘦長和細而堅實的，沒有安靜，不斷地在無休息的神經質的行動中。他的面孔是戴着面具。這面具是他自己的面孔——黑的，智慧的，詩人的，激情地超越敏感的，像赤子一樣絕無援助的，對於生命起宗敎般愛的——一種外表的固定的約束，使它高為一種侮謾，疏忽反抗，快樂地譏誚與縱慾的一「般神」（Pan）一般的表情。』狄翁安東尼，實是與「羅伯脫·梅的」有些類似。從兩個人，我們可以看出在沃尼爾戲劇裏有兩種相反個性的角色。一種細長黑眼，敏感富於詩意的英雄，一種堅實健美智力普通的配角。這兩種典型，差不多可以在他大部分的劇中找出。</p>
<p>同樣，我們在他的另一劇本「草」（The　　Stoow）中，那裏面的三個男主角，也有其上面所講一樣的特質。「比爾·加摩地」，沃尼爾對他的形容道：他是一個五十歲的人，體態魁梧，闊肩胛，有着長而粗大筋肉脈管臂膊，毛森森的手。他的顏面是瘦削而笨大，他的鼻是短而平，他的口大，臀厚而不靈利，他的膚色是多斑點的——紅紫相間而多雀斑，他的頭髮是短而不整潔？頂上禿了一塊。他的小的藍色眼睛的表情是一種自私的狡滑。」而對另一位主角「佛萊德，湼可兒斯」，沃尼爾也這樣描寫道：「他是一個二十三歲年靑的傢伙，體格堅實，頭髮美麗，沒有出奇的美，老派的格式。他的態度是很明軒地要裝着雅致的上等人：他常是滿面春風，但在他的小的刻刻留心的藍眼中有着小氣的錙銖必較的表情」。對於另一位角色「史脫芬·莫雷，」沃尼爾這樣描寫：「莫雷是三十歲的人——一個頎長的瘦弱的而有一副怪異容貌的傢伙，面孔是慘白的陷於高聳顴骨當中，而以兩隻眼睛一張口為分界點，消沈與憔悴在這樣年靑。他的智慧而大的黑眼，在休見的時候，有着疲乏頹喪的表情，但一當他的內在的隱情一經觸犯，他立卽會用那種嘲笑諧趣的掩藏　能來答復。他的態度由他　談　表現出來——是易受刺激多疑與謹慎的——看起來是後天獲得的性質，多過任何他的本性的部分。」很明顯在這位「史脫芬·莫雷」的個性中，我們可以找出他的許多特質，與狄翁·安東尼相像的。更不庸講，「加摩地」與「佛萊德·涅可兒斯」，也是具備着他的配角的特質的劇中人物。</p>
<p>在「不同」（Diffrent）一劇中，我們雖找不出劇中人物有一個與主角「加勒伯·維廉」對立的男角。然而這一角色，却是　備上述兩種個性的。沃尼爾描述他是「高大有强有力體魄近三十歲的人。黑髮，銳利的黑眼，面孔粗突不平　着紫銅色，口雖固執而頗帶良善性」。由這　看來，「維廉是缺乏別的劇中角色的許多特質，可是　者且暫安無躁，順着　的劇本讀下去，到了第二幕，你又可以發現沃尼爾把他的這位角色的性格加以補充地說：「他的面孔，帶着在一副情感的面具下的固定的表情，但他的雙眼不能掩藏一種內心的鬥爭，一種煩擾與痛苦的求知的努力，一秤被不可知傷害的憔悴形容。」經過這樣的一種暗示，把他的而具揭開，他又是沃尼爾劇中，具有同樣血肉情感的角色了。</p>
<p>另外一個「煩擾」的劇中英雄，「上帝之子皆生翼」（Ail　God's　Chillun　Got　Wingo）中的「吉末。哈利」，「一個行止安　的黑人小孩有着奇異煩擾敏感的面孔。一因為這角色是黑人，我們很可以假定這　黑人，就是沃尼爾劇中典型人物——大而黑眼睛角色的另一恣態。「楡樹下的慾望」（Desire　　UuderThe　Elms）中，也有這樣一個黑眼煩擾敏感的靈魂。同樣「麥琪兒，凱樸」在「溶合」（Welded）也是這樣一個英雄。「奧靈，麥農」在「伊萊克屈拉的守孝」Mourning　becomes　Electon）也是這同一角色的另一恣態。够了，這些「點將」。「老子一氣化之淸」，我們也可以同樣講，沃尼爾一個中心人物，化成了許多不同的恣態。有人也許要講這樣的看法，未免犯了主觀的錯誤。不過我早已吿訴過你們，我不過是肓人一樣在摸象。明白了這一點，那也就不必對我苛求了。</p>
<p>我在上面旣把沃尼爾戲劇中的男主角的個性講述過了，那末在他的戲劇中的女主角，也可不可以這樣機械地來把他們歸納幾個類型呢？用數學的頭腦來分析文學的作品，這本身也許就是一件荒謬絕倫的事。可是你暫且不要管，讓我來試試如何。</p>
<p>在沃尼爾劇中的女主角，雖不像他的劇中的男主角一樣，有着很明顯的兩種典型，可是我們可以找出一個共同特點，那就是那裏面的人物，都是犯了變態性慾的病，因此在他的劇中的女人，很少不是妓女，或者淫蕩的女人，或者色情狂者。讓我也像在講述他劇中男角一節中所講述的一樣，一個個來點將。「渴」（Thirsl）中的女角是如此。「遙遠的歸程」（Long　Voyage　Home）中的女主角是如此。「蛛網」（web）中的女角是如此。「加里比之月」（Moon　of　the　Carihees）中的女人是如此。「安娜。克里斯蒂中的「馬太」與「安娜」是如此。「鎔合」中的婦女是如此。「大神白朗」中「莎蓓兒」是如此；「拉薩魯斯笑了（Lazarus　Langhed）中的女角彭貝娃，是如此。這些女人，都是妓女。他如在「　電機」（Dynamo）中「阿達與「發厄夫夫人」，在「楡樹下的慾望」的「阿琵　蒲鐵門」，「鎔合」中的「伊里諾·凱樸」，在「伊萊克屈拉」中的「克里斯蒂·麥農」，都是些性慾不滿足的女人，而在一不同」中的「愛瑪克勞斯蓓」，與「奇異的挿曲」中「妮娜」則是有色情在的女人。</p>
<p>在沃尼爾戲劇中的女主角，也有不少的常態的角色，可是不知道沃尼爾是有意要把他的戲劇引人入勝的原故，還是他的倘性上，照了佛洛德的學說，有着性虐在的原故，他對於他劇中的這樣的女角，常表現他的輕蔑。他劇中所有這樣的角色，差不多都把他們描畫成偏狹的小氣的，固執而缺乏理解的人物。他們的性格，剛巧與那些性慾變態的人相反。那些人是肉體上受人蹂躪，而精神却是崇高的，同情的與有理解的。這樣的對比在「大神白朗」中表現得很充分。在這本劇富中，讀者先看到的是「狄翁，安東尼」的太太「瑪加蕾」。她是一個常態的婦女，而是沃尼爾所謂「維持種族延長的永遠女人」。她的愛她的丈夫，因為他是聰明詩意的浪漫的，但她從來沒有潑現他的眞實的躱在面具後面的性格。後來當他脫去了面具，表白他是怎樣一個眞實的性格，她對於他却起了恐懼，而不認識他了。這與其說對於那些庸俗女人的諷刺，不如說對於整個人類的諷刺。在他方面，那位妓女「凱蓓兒」，倒是狄翁的理解者，他走到那兒去獲　同情與安慰。這兩者的關係是柏拉圖式的戀愛。她是他的顧問者，引導者，她曉得他的內在的性格。在「發動機」中，讀者也可以看到了一個淸楚的對比。「萊脫夫人」是一個正直的夫人，而「發厄夫夫人」却是一四放縱的女人。然而她却是同情的仁慈的，同時甚至給與愛給恨她的人。因為外表正直，却無補於她的內心的殘忍和欺騙，「萊脫夫人」結果把她自己的兒子，壓迫　「發厄夫夫人」家中去找求安慰與幸福。」在「拉薩魯斯笑了」一劇中，也是那位「彭貝娃」有着崇高的精神，她明白「拉薩魯斯「的敎訓，而願意與之偕死。在「鎔合」中，也看到這樣一個塲面，那位劇中英雄，跪在那位高貴的妓女的前面，誓死不起來，除非她能赦免他的敢於走近她的過錯。最後他吻她的額角，而稱她為「姊妹」。同樣在一安娜，克里斯蒂」中，安娜自從海的浪濤中，洗凈她的被環　壓迫而造成的罪惡後，她受內心的責備，而不願欺騙愛　而同時受她愛的那位粗魯的水手「白克」，她終於告訴了她而那水手　到了她的過去一切，却怫然而去。她的父親「克里斯，克里斯托佛生」先前因為反對她嫁給水手的原故，對於她的愛，她的愛人，一直堅持反對，等到她也曉得她的以往和那位水手為了這件事跑開以後，反想去求那位水手來重圓舊好，這些地方，我以為沃尼爾把男性的卑鄙，可笑，圈於成見，完全褐露出來，所以他所嘲笑的不是這些不幸的女人，而反是那些　　庸俗的男子。所以有人說，一個女人出現於沃尼爾戲劇的舞台上，十對一之比是那個女人差不多都是性慾反常，如果是的話，可以担保，那是舞台上最出色的一個角色，這一句話，差不多道盡沃尼爾劇中的奧妙了。</p>

<h3>特載　我國桐油出口貿易之展望（續）</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>最近四年來美英德法軍費比較表</p>
<p>據復興月刋四卷十一期中之一九三六年上半期世界經濟一文</p>
<p>據建國月刊　　卷六期中之現階中列强軍備競爭一文</p>
<p>各國軍需工業大致注重軍艦·飛機·及軍械之製造、凡此種種、均需用多量之桐油、自一九三三年以來、各國軍費均呈增加傾向、當此歐洲風雲日緊之際、各國軍費在今後數年內、亦必有增無减、此種軍費之日漸增加、頗足以證明軍需工業之日趨發展、各國軍需工業旣在賡續不斷之增加、則其對於桐油之供給、亦必有賡續不斷之需要、</p>
<p>再從世界建築業方面觀之、除美國外、其他各國均無數字可稽、然吾人深知各國為促進景氣之恢復、及救濟失業計、均曾撥大宗欵項、施行於公共工程計劃、如法國議會於最近數年內、指定一〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郞、為公共工程建談之經費、於本年內卽已用去四、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郞、又德國方面近年來對此事業、亦用鉅欵以進行之、英國亦然、査美國由政府核准之建築費於一九三四年、共達三四八百萬美元、一九三五年共達五九七百萬美元、及至本年則更見增加、於本年首五個月之總數、較前兩年同期者、增加頗鉅、吾人試觀下表、卽可知美國建築費激增之趨勢矣、未完）</p>

<h3>由淋病療法真正成功特提出指導：——　徘徊十字街頭之淋病患者</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>紐侖堡花柳醫院之實騐報告完全證明了感應性療法的確效　指示澈底的除淋方法為各國政府所熱烈贊襄患淋者應自覺</p>
<p>福地耳氏說：「要在病中，才能體會出健康的真議與樂趣」。的確，這話從淋病者的身上看起來是更為實在的。淋病患者的痛苦，了臨床醫師以外，恐怕只有患者才知道。</p>
<p>起先，當染得了淋病時，尿道內流出來的綠色的膿液。小便頻數，而放尿卻非常的疼痛，夾著輕微的搔癢，就真像是蟲咬蟻齒，痛苦不堪。而龜頭腐爛的也有，包皮浮腫的也有。在這個當兒，為了急於求治於是就隨便的服些藥劑，碰巧遇到藥性純粹一點的，服後膿液減少，痛苦較差，還以為藥已對症，便不去治療。服到劣藥，卻往往有生命危險。</p>
<p>淋病在沒有要本治愈前，表面痛苦雖除，可是淋毒卻已深地竄入血內，一和妻子交接，便會傳染對方，永遠的不能生育，當妻子患了淋病後，陰道白帶淋漓，子宮腐爛，甚至不便行動。而男子呢，他的慢性淋毒，最顯明的就是睾丸腫硬，或者小便淋絲混淆，放尿時尿液分又為二。還有小便不通的膀胱炎，肢節殘廢的關節炎，惟及精如豬血的攝護腺炎精囊炎等，有一如此，便不能夠生殖子嗣。</p>
<p>所以患淋病的人，在沒有得到根治前，是終日盼望有一個切實療法出現的。意志薄弱的人，聽信了廣告的宣傳，貿然購服淋藥，到後來卻追悔也來不及。其實世界上絕對沒有一瓶包好和兩瓶斷根的藥。即最新特效藥「克淋儂」也要連服四五瓶，始能斷根！如今老實告訴你，自從德國淋病權威學家發明了「克淋儂」一藥後，淋病患者從此得著一個正確治療途徑了。</p>
<p>因為「克淋儂」是已被舉世公認的淋病特效藥，為感應性蛋白體黃色素合製劑。是合製劑的首出者：服後確能根除血內淋毒，根本治愈不發。據紐侖堡花柳醫院的報告，最近一月中有三百二十人服「克淋儂」全部治愈，為三分之二以上之比云。</p>
<p>性的故事</p>
<h3>一幅香艷絕倫的縮寫　性的囹圄</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>舟經來因河，看到一片青翠的樹林，襯著一泓碧水風景明媚，氣候溫和，那地方是屬於Liehtensein的小島，它那裏的人民對於男女是絕對的平等，而女子又這樣美麗，她們戀愛，是公開的，在樹林，在河邊，一　一　地青年男女舞蹈著，歌唱著，溫馨的南風，中人欲醉。自然她們這樣狂歡，性的事情，是很自由的。凡是外邊人到過那邊的小島，假如他們不拒絕你的話，眾多住了幾時，會被這甜蜜的生活，愉快的享樂所迷的，把從前一切痛苦都丟向九天雲外。所以有人說這地方，多已樂不思蜀的。</p>
<p>由於性活的放縱，所以性神經衰弱的病，也自然是很流行了。但他們並不存什麼恐懼的心理。他們知道服用德國梅倫氏所發明的「補體康」一藥，此藥對於色慾過度，手淫傷殘青春腺等，服後都有絕對的有效。所以「補體康」在那裏很為流行。都一致的服用。所以有恃無恐的狂樂著。</p>
<p>來因河的那小島，歐戰前本來是屬於德意的。歐戰後劃為中立區，否則仍為德國所有。自從那小島傳說出這香艷的新聞後，各國醫家，也一致注意，實地考察。我在俄國勞動大學醫科研究醫學時，已聞教授貝薩博士說，「補體康」一藥，對於性神經衰弱，遺精，早洩，頭痛失眠，心悸，健忘等，確有良效。並能促使性器官發育不全。惟有遺精病的，可與「耐而斯遺精片」同服，以鎮攝精關。更有雙管齊下，相得益彰之妙。余自該校畢業後，即以「補體康」一藥治好許多青年人因手淫和色慾過度而來的一切性神經衰弱症狀。此藥現在已遍行我國，尤其是都市之間。</p>
<h3>一個尚在醫治中的慢性淋</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>患者邵坪蘭君：前因酒後失足花叢，輾轉醫治，病勢反劇，尿道狹窄，小便不能，每一次小便，非費數分鐘不可，後來愈演愈凶，雖欲小便努責，仍不得出，故排尿用橡皮管通插尿道。小腹膨脹，牽引作痛。其右側睾丸，亦因淋毒而致腫大墜重，　因此步履維艱。經余用科學方法檢查，及用手術，將夙尿排清，防其尿中毒，更行尿道反射鏡膀胱反射鏡檢騐。見其膀胱內壁發炎紅腫，有數處已呈糜爛之狀，（如下圖）此為膀胱炎與副睾丸炎之合係症，非予以通盤全部治療不可。囑用「抗淋水」居家在尿道內洗滌使在尿道中之淋菌，無所托足，更囑內服「克淋儂」，以殺菌消炎防腐，間用電氣治療，截至今日為止，膀胱炎腫退至十分之八九，小便暢利，惟尚有少許淋絲。故須繼續至一星期後，始可全愈。現尚在余處治療。待確獲根治後再行報告。</p>
<p>此爲膀胱内壁炎腫之一部分現經用克淋儂等醫治。病灶已縮小云。</p>
<h3>不可忽略之白帶</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>因為每個女子，都存了十女九帶的觀念，遂以為白帶一病，並無足重輕，於是任意忽略不治。豈知此乃極為危險之盲目舉動。大則喪失生命，小亦損害健康，至經水乖亂，停經不姙，健美無緣者，又多見於女子之白帶病。患者，陰道常白帶刺　浸淫，糜爛炎腫，房事小便時，均感極大痛楚。所以夫婦感情水炭，丈夫多借此為離婚口實，至於因淋毒而來白帶，則含毒性更烈，能毒殺精子卵子，成為不孕之因。醫治之方，以外用一「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，以殺菌防腐止泌，則帶病即可洗滌乾潔。惟因淋毒而來者可兼服「克淋儂」，因體虛經亂乖常者，可兼服「補女容」則白帶即可解決矣。</p>

<p>慢性副睾丸炎傳染路線</p>
<p>慢性淋病，為急性淋時失治之結果，固人盡可知，惟淋病而轉至睾丸炎，睾丸炎而至絕孕者，則又多為吾人所忽略矣。其傳染之路線，為經尿道炎衝至射精管，經輸精管而達凸之形狀。自覺的有輕度之疼痛，全身症狀並無變化。惟其攝護腺分泌物及尿中有淋菌與葡萄狀菌可以證明。此種睾丸炎最易再發。故尤不可不及早根治之。如一旦既成慢性睾丸炎，則淋菌因破壞睾丸組織，失去製造精子機能，遂為絕孕之要因。在臨床上之統計，淋病中之無姙，以睾丸炎者占絕對之多數。蓋亦基於此種理由也。</p>
<p>雖然，在未至兩側睾丸炎，或兩側睾丸炎而未至絕境者，尚可設法挽救。有住武昌路田國雄君，前因淋病困於職務與環境，所以輾轉成為慢性睾丸炎，雖婚娶多年，迄未有育。嗣其同學繆敬之君，送以拙著，「性病全書」一冊，知余頗善理淋病。乃稅車而來。乞余治療。經用科學方法之嚴密檢查，其右側睾丸種大如桃，且有化硬趨勢，左側亦已波及，故尚未至絕孕之境地。故除用長短電波交互聞法外。同時內服「克淋儂」，以消炎殺菌鎮痛利尿。更用「抗淋水」為外用藥。前後計服用五星期，所患全愈。睾丸亦恢復常態。惟而製造精液機能得以健全。愈後不幾，其夫人即經斷而有孕矣，</p>

<h3>以最經濟的方法　獲取迅速有確實的治癆成效</h3>

<p>生肺癆的病人，都知道肺部被結核菌所侵蝕。他們渴望著能夠有直接撲滅癆菌的藥物，以獲取迅速治愈肺癆的特效。雖然人同此心，然而事實上確乎還沒有這樣的製劑發明。一般患者缺乏醫藥常識，又不知道肺癆的內部病理變化，夢想有這樣的殺癆菌的療法，化了不少的金錢，費去無限的時間，末了病勢日重一日，還是沒有痊愈，其悲慘的苦境說起來真令人寒心。他們不知道這觀念的根本錯誤所在，卻反怪肺病全然沒有辦法。這真是太可憐了！</p>
<p>我們現在不必妄想著什麼直接殺滅癆菌的藥物，也沒有一種臟器療法所能治愈肺癆。今日的一個最有科學根據的合理療法，就病家自療的觀點來就，應該首推最新製劑「補肺拿爾」了。本藥的藥理根據，是在縮小肺部病灶的緊張，而減緩其呼吸運動，這樣，便能夠迅速增進肺內石灰質的生成，密密包圍菌。一方減少酸素，則癆菌失去活力而漸死滅。故服後凡咳血潮熱，咯痰盜汗，胸痛神疲等，即見減輕。若與「補體康」或女用「補女容」同服，更能治愈神經衰弱，遺精失眠及婦女月經不調等症了。</p>
<h3>容易損害健美之女性病</h3>
<p>— 東京帝國大學醫科畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>對於以健美為單位的女性，最易兵貴損害的，要以內分同能障礙的了。但現在一般的女性，尤其是摩登女子，為要博得男性的歡心，只知道天天塗上濃厚的脂粉，這種局部的，而且是暫時的表面上的美容術，終掩不了憔悴的玉容。雖說因為塗上脂粉而得到男子一時的歡心，不過很難把他維持久遠的，她在情場上失敗是當然的。</p>
<p>不過這種落伍的美容術，已敵不過根本的美容術了。一個發育不全、乳房平坦、臀部瘦削面色枯敗的女子，若是服了德國梅倫氏所發明的「補女容」，牠能促增卵巢的內分泌機能，使新陳代謝機能加速。血液旺盛。所以有全身發育健全，乳房高峙，曲線美呈露，而兩頰也紅潤豐腴，肌肉充實，皮膚細膩，精神活潑。眼波流動，撫媚動人，這才可稱為標準的美人。也是女性幸福的根本，這種美麗，不是用脂粉可以改造成功的。此外關於月經痛，和久婚不孕的症狀，自然可以掃除了。現這種內分泌製劑的「補女容」一藥，已為一般病態女子的瓖寶，因為牠能改造女性的健美，給予女性的幸福。有白帶病的可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥。</p>
<h3>及冬進補</h3>
<p>— 陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>滋補藥之注意</p>
<p>下級動物，如昆蟲鱗介，至冬則必蟄伏，以準備來春之奮發有為。人類雖居於高等動物，然進化至今，猶不能避免自然之法則。蓋人之體工上，至冬令為一閉藏之時，其體內所吸收之養料，皆儲藏於肝臟內，惟待來春及一年之用。吾國人舊俗，至冬令則服膏滋藥，固亦合科學之原理。</p>
<p>然及冬進補，擇藥宜慎。蓋須旺盛全身細胞活力，非專事培補某一臟器及壯陽所能奏效也。以余實騐，「補體康」之補力，最具偉效。因此藥能以補充體內荷爾蒙及細胞，確有補腦補精補腎之整個功效也。</p>

<p>胃病身弱</p>
<p>鄞縣黃兆鼎君來函雲：鄙人患年久胃病，食慾不佳。每逢宴會，停箸不舉。飯後吞酸噯氣，胸部脹悶作痛，大便每燥結。幸於前月得友人經君介紹，購服德國「強胃精」未二盒，即獲良效。乃續服二盒，胃脹胃痛，霍然而廖。體亦壯健矣！</p>
<p>自淋療濁</p>
<p>北浙江路林永華君來函雲：敝人誤染淋濁，小便困難，尿濁不清，莖痛非言可喻。尿道　口膿液阻塞，龜頭紅腫，曾服淋藥多鐘，均無產騐，購服「克淋儂」，並向永安公司西藥部購「抗淋水」依說明書洗滌局部，況獲奇效，尿液澄清，痛苦全失。惟不知「抗淋水」配制妥善，無絲毫刺激，雖常人有尿道　疾患或婦女白帶，亦可依法外用，洗滌局部，毫無流敝雲。</p>
<p>久咳</p>
<p>姚熙君：久咳多痰可服「補肺拿爾」，確有偉效</p>

<h3>遺精夢洩引起之性力萎弱：久婚不育之自療</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>勃朗彌頓在他的絕命書中有過這樣的話：「我為了性的愛甚至犧牲，我的一切：然而在這方面我是個無能者，我有著天賦的雄性機能，但無法發揮它克服異性的力量，我的妻子因得不到滿足的人生樂趣，她離開我了。消滅乾淨，低能肯定了死亡的降臨」。</p>
<p>讀了這首悲哀的文字使我們知道了性能低弱者的痛苦。在青春發動期的青年，受淫書或劣友的引誘，沒有不冒犯手淫的。用手淫出精，損害輸精管的弊害也就更大。使精管失去控制力，而遺精精漏，早洩男兒遺，都會相繼而來。有些人房事過多，濫用了性器，也會有遺精的症候。這是性力萎弱的第一步，理進即成為陰萎不舉了。此等症候均為不能生育的原因。</p>
<p>要治愈遺精和性力萎弱，不是培補性腺所能奏效，弄得要補充大量的精液，使性力壯健不可。大生理學家梅倫氏根據此理，採取猩猩獅子虎海狗等勇壯動物睾丸精，製為「補體康」一腎，服能即能補給大量精液，而使性力強壯，虎虎有力，為補藥種子的要藥。如遺精日久可並服「耐而斯遺精片」以收速效！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談判與國聯</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前國際法庭法官王寵惠博士，昨晨在滬寓接見某社記者，發表關於國事的談話，（一）停止談判問題，並不發表肯定的斷語，（二）對於綏事，謂當可向國聯申訴，有無結果，雖尙成問題，但國聯現方從事修改盟的，力圖自拔，盼能恢復舊日威信耳，這一派說話，就呌打官話，然而以我政府的立縐，和外交官的立塲，不能不這樣說，外交官向來不作興說有邊際的話，所以我十分贊同日本某軍官的話，綏邊的事我們軍隊是參加的，槍械是我國供給的，他的說話，何等開誠布公，直捷了當。</p>
<p>至於停止談判問題，其賓是不必說，應該停止，因為綏遠的事，也是談判中重要之一點，現在弄到如此糟糕，尙有何說，但停止談判，亦有兩種方式，一種是正式官吿停止談判，一種是無形停頓談判，因為現在綏邊的事，日方當局，尙認為我國土匪的騷動，是我國國內的事，與日方無關，但是事實怎樣。眞所謂司馬昭之心，路人其見，不必多說。只有將錯就錯，以誤傳誤，將經過的事實，作適宜的應付，原是絕好辦法。</p>
<p>若向國聯申訴一事，我以為大可不必，雖然王博士的話，也明知國聯的懦弱無能，並不是不希望現在，而希望將來，自應從氈毯角上走，大寬轉處行，我國在國際問的立塲說，申訴國聯，原也是一件應做的工作，無論九一八之役，阿比西之役，多曾向國聯燒過香，叩過頭，完全誠求不應，但現在的希望，並不在於現在之國聯，而希望將來之國聯，至少限度，也希望出來說幾句好聽的話，此說似也，但現在歐洲的局勢，法西斯主義，與非法西斯主義，已形兩極端派，欲改造國聯，也恐非容易的事，我再退一百步言之，卽使可能，與我國亦並不發生任何關係。</p>
<p>我今日拆穿西洋鏡言之，任何國家，多以自己利益為本位，决不會以他人利益為前提，决不會無端而帮他人的忙，也不會無端而結他人的怨，（一）他們果與某一國有利害切身關係，則某一國到緊急關頭，自會揮拳攘臂，打抱不平，倘絕無關係，卽使磕頭如搗蒜，也無濟於事，（二）確有利害切身關係，但自己能力薄弱，也决不肯從井救人，不能說他袖手旁觀，以收漁入之利，至少也是乖人不吃眼前虧的長著，所以我敢說現在的國聯是無用，而今後的國聯也不會有用。</p>
<p>試看現在的世界，是怎樣一個世界？任何議會，任何聯盟，任何的章，任何法律，多是廢紙，多不中用，所有用的，只有飛機，大砲，和坦克車。</p>
<h3>戲班子</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>鎮上，來了個戲班子。</p>
<p>淸早，四福上城去挑糞，看見他們打城裏下來的。</p>
<p>這個班子一到，就把陳家荒塲看中了。架起一個蠻大的布蓬子，布蓬子外面二尺來的光景，再築了垜繩的圍塲。本時看看老大老大的陳家荒塲，現在看來似乎小了一些。</p>
<p>班子裏的幾個姑娘，打扮得儘嫖緻的，騷形怪狀的在街上亂闖。那些本來最會尋事的毛頭小夥子們，戴上了從城裏新買來的鴨舌頭帽，有些特別穿上元色的新布鞋，跟在她們背後亂嚷。</p>
<p>走過裕興茶館，她們拐了進去，向老闆瞎眼二生要了兩壺紅茶。</p>
<p>「小姐，城裏下來的吧？」瞎眼二生，一邊抹着台子，一邊陪着笑臉說。</p>
<p>「嗯！」那個年紀最大的，不在意的說。</p>
<p>「幾時開鑼」？</p>
<p>「下半天」。</p>
<p>瞎眼二生替她們裝好了茶，站在桌旁不走。在拉風箱的二生嫂，向他橫了橫眼，但，他沒有看見，還是笑迷迷的老瞅着她們。</p>
<p>「買幾隻銅板？」</p>
<p>「八個！」</p>
<p>「嗯，倒蠻便宜的，演的什麼戲！可是京戲？」</p>
<p>「不，是新戲！」這個年紀最輕，面孔也最漂亮，穿件紅花洋布旗袍，她呷了口茶。</p>
<p>「新戲……唔！是不是文明戲？城裏新興的戲……」</p>
<p>「瞎子！泡茶！」</p>
<p>二生嫂一把把二牛拖了過來，指着剛進門的二公公。</p>
<p>「泡茶，泡茶！吃白茶」的要你儘開心！騷貨！」二生給二牛嫂一拖，眞好沒趣，看見進來的主顧，又是慣吃「白茶」的二公公，氣得他把唾沫朝二生嫂臉上亂吐。</p>
<p>她們坐了一會，要走了。</p>
<p>「老闆，兩壼茶幾錢？」</p>
<p>「算得什麽，算得什麼！」瞎眼二生把錢儘往外推。</p>
<p>「那能可以吃『白茶』呢，幾錢？老闆！」</p>
<p>「小意思，總共十六個子兒，算了，算了。」</p>
<p>這可急壞了二生嫂，她趕忙從燒火凳上站起來，走到瞎眼二生的身背後，在他腿上重重的扭了一把。瞎眼才沒趣的送她出門口，臨走，她們向老闆說：「下午來綳綳塲子啊！」</p>
<p>「騷貨，不要臉，沒人要的臭×！」二生嫂待她們走遠了，才有勁地駡了起來。</p>
<p>說是兩點鐘開塲，可是在一點鐘的光景，已客滿了。</p>
<p>瞎眼二生是頂起勁的一個，每碰到一個熟人，他終是買弄的說：「早上，在我店裏吃茶呢！」</p>
<p>「噢，在你店裏吃茶？」對方不信任</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>地說。</p>
<p>「誰騙你？那個穿紅洋布的，還跟我……」</p>
<p>「別說了，少吹牛吧！」</p>
<p>「眞的……」他急紅了臉，開不出口來。</p>
<p>「算眞的，看你捧塲，笑了笑，走開了。」</p>
<p>開戲了，起先是幾個男子的要武藝，這原不是他們要看的，加之，沒有什麽好，有一個連飛又都接不住呢。這，給他們一陣倒彩，喊跑了。</p>
<p>第二幕是「刁劉氏」，這，把全塲的興趣都提了起來。</p>
<p>「好哇！」沒等出塲，瞎眼二生已在喊彩了。</p>
<p>扮刁劉氏的，就是那個穿紅花洋布的小圓臉的姑娘。</p>
<p>「可惜，那件襖子大了一些。」一個臉尖尖的說。</p>
<p>「可不是，要是緊了一些，那小蘋果似的一對……哈哈。」旁邊的那個大塊頭，眨了眨眼。</p>
<p>戲是演到最後的「刁劉氏騎木騾遊四門」的一幕了。這時那個戲班子的主人，打「腔話」了。他先抱了抱拳，他說</p>
<p>「諸位大老官，要聽什麽曲子，可以點上來。刁劉氏是壞人，我們要打她。看！這樣打！愈重愈好！」</p>
<p>他從袋裏摸出來了把銅板，往那個小圓臉的刁劉氏丟去，接着，又抱了抱拳，退了進去。</p>
<p>「十八摸！」瞎眼二生第一個喊，摸了兩個銅板，飛了上去，丟在她屁股上，彈了下來。</p>
<p>「好哇！」有些人在袋裏摸銅板了。</p>
<p>臺上的那個，笑了笑，眞唱起來了。</p>
<p>雙手……</p>
<p>阿姐的……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>男子們把銅子往她丟去，有的打她的臉；有的打她的屁股……。女子們從袋裏摸出了一個銅子，看了看，又放了進去。還是從地上檢了好些小石子，往上扔，有兩個老太婆，背轉了臉狠命的在扔。</p>
<p>銅板，石子像雪片似的打上來，她額角上受了一塊小石子，腫了起來，脚骨上也受了一下，她祗把手遮來遮去的遮，還是笑着唱「十八摸」。</p>
<p>鼻子上又受着了一記，出紅了。她受不住，逃了進去。班主人又出來打了一陣「腔話」，賠了不是，這才散了戲。</p>
<p>第二天，這個戲班子不見了。</p>
<p>四福從城裏挑糞回來說：他們上城去的，那個扮刁劉氏的小姑娘，臉上紮了好些的布。</p>
<p>「騷貨！活該！還不曾撕掉那隻臭×！」二生嫂把風箱拉得更有勁。</p>

<p>曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「西廂記」</p>
<p>秀才人情紙半張。白銀一兩具禪堂。最喜物華三寳地。參禪坐聽解金剛。耳畔杜鵑啼寂寞。異鄉旅舍更凄凉。此間是，消風明月無人管。息肩駐足借西廂。閒坐小軒參易理。螢窗開卷念文章。一雙僧俗嘵嘵話。步出靑衣婢女娘。為遵崔老夫人命。特地禪房定道塲。先老相爺生死忌。請僧追薦上西方。十五良辰拜法王。說罷砍行留一步。為是情痴傅粉郞。張生凑上深深揖。姐姐是，莫非鶯鶯小姐的婢紅娘。我是，洛陽才子張君瑞。為姻緣僧舍作書房。蕊珠宮裏煩通報。說是，家中尙未有妻房。紅娘聽。變面龐。相公說話太荒唐。非禮不言從古說。讀書君子愛輕在。老夫人操冰霜節。三尺僮兒不許入中堂。話說婢聽還可恕。夫人知曉恨非常。從今出口要思量。</p>
<p>何芸芳何琴芳「雙珠球」</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）下午三時半至四時一刻</p>
<p>開篇「宋江」</p>
<p>粱山大盜宋公明。招集紛紛亡命人。甚致於，奪庫戕官傷士卒。打家刧舍擄鄕村。况且那，三十六人無賴者。山東河朔敢橫行。替天行道是欺人語。姑待招安　衆心。偏遇着。官兵捕盜無功績。端只為，衆散無常不易尋。當日裏，徵欽二帝俱無道。用這班，童貫高俅與蔡京。滿朝盡屬卉權臣。人心到處離平服。並起羣雄盜弄兵。雖則跳梁皆小醜。烽烟四起欠調停。民窮財盡無糧餉。草寇些須不認眞。大帥幸逢張叔夜。本來他，六韜三略智謀深。竟能彀，一夜工夫盡蕩平。到後來，全部著成水滸傳。耐菴施老的妙才情。無中生有虛中實。譜出天罡地煞星。想入非非眞可愛。湊齊一百又八人。妙不過，强盜終歸段景住。還有那，及時好雨送江心。寓意精微極有因。賞格曾懸幾萬貫。故所以，紙牌藉此做輸贏。但不知，長弓短箭何人射。疑假疑眞張字形。梁山結局夢驚醒。</p>
<p>蔣賓初「三笑」</p>
<p>新聲（一三八〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「三笑扮女」</p>
<p>瀟洒風流周美人。才華艷絕貌超羣。與枝山飲酒談衷曲。提起髫齡一段情。有妹姿容全似我。可憐早歲命歸陰。高堂思女病床衾。賴有閨中賢嫂嫂。將兄作　善調停。半載沉苛一日輕。允明聽說微微笑。男子如何扮女人。豈無破綻可搜尋。負　周郞偏不服。兩人打賭定輸贏。說罷回身進內堂。到東樓嫂嫂共談論。娘娘不允生煩惱。莫奈何只得下樓枰。忽遇桂芳小婢子。命他易服換衣裙。撲朔速離渾莫辨。身材娘娜態娉婷。望月廳先見娘親面。要一試萱堂老眼睛。果然瞞過暮年人。好比當年老萊子。班衣戲彩樂天倫。遊戲之中將歡笑呈。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>「上海」公映「忠心為國」</h3>
<p>今秋在上海大戲院開映的，除了「馬戲團」等，「忠心為國」已經是第六部蘇聯新片了。</p>
<p>「忠心為國它是說明國民非但要在戰錢上為國雜忠，為國犧牲，並且應當在事業方面，也忠心鬥爭，處處為國家着想。</p>
<p>「忠心為國」並不是一部普通的探險影片，而是一部藝術影片，並且也與「冰天雪地」不同，它是更具有藝術性的</p>
<p>其中最可觀的是中亞細亞的天然風物，帕米爾高原的峻險山地，小亞細亞土人的生活，赤白軍的戰爭。</p>
<p>片中對白，最後一句很可以表明這部影片的主題：</p>
<p>「胸膛裏的血沒有冷時，誰也敵不住我們，無限的沙漠險峻的高山，都擋小住我們」。</p>
<h3>廣陵潮之特殊貢獻</h3>
<p>廣陵潮為藝華公司本年度犧牲最大之一片，將於日內在新光卡爾登兩戲院同時獻映。劇本係將李涵秋氏遺作廣陵潮一書所改編，其情節之妙，凡曾讀廣陵潮說部者，類能道之，而　演手法之純熟，演員演技之精進，與夫佈　之雄麗，皆是使國產影片放一異彩，其後參以革命運動，造成熱烈緊張之空氣，而得此盡　盡美之巨片焉。</p>
<h3>「賽金花」續演一日</h3>
<p>半數收入捐移援綏　「生死同心」暫緩映</p>
<p>明星新片「生死同心」原定今日起在金城大戲院公映，上午並柬邀各界試映一塲，茲因四十年代劇社與金城共同議定今日續演「賽金花」一日，以全部收入之半數捐助綏遠抗敵將士，故將「生死向心」暫緩開映，同時試映日期亦當另行公佈，凡收到明星「生死同心」試映券者可不必枉顧。</p>
<h3>四大女明星聯合主演的「四美圖」今日公映</h3>
<p>珍妮蓋諾，洛麗泰揚，康絲登裴納和　蒙茜蒙，都是好萊塢獨當一面的女明屋，現在二十世紀福斯公司，竟不惜犧牲把這四位女星眾集起來，聯合主演「四美圖」Ladies　in　Love一片，這不能不說是木年度影壇上的奇蹟罷。故事係述四位靑春的少女，過着單調和寂寞的生活，因此不免向着求愛的路境，各人去追求如意的郞君。珍妮在個年輕的醫生處帮傭，洛麗愛上了一個靑年的貴族，後來聽說他要和另一位女郞結婚了，氣得要服毒自殺。絲登是愛購奢侈的少女，同一位工程師打得火熱，可是偏偏遇着茜蒙也看上了他，因此父發生糾葛了。全片描寫兩性戀愛的問題，非常透澈深刻，滑　哀感，兼而有之。片巳定於今日起在大光明公映了，影迷　勿交臂失之。</p>
<h3>新華公司　向影迷徵求題材</h3>
<p>我們深深地感覺到沒有空閒時間去接觸社會上各種各種的人物，也看不到社會上各種各種的是非，所以不能廣泛地採納題材來編寫劇本。但是我們相信，社會上儘多黑暗的事件，儘多有寃無處可伸的人，也儘多仗義執言與賢智高明的人，故特公開徵求，無論任何階級的人物，胸中或有牢騷，或一生顚沛經過，或發現任何機關或家庭或個人的黑幕，或一切疑煩難解的問題，或對於社會國家有所建議，都可以寫出來，不論文字通順與吾，不論字數多少，逕寄上海斜土路二五六七號新華影業公司「題材採訪部」，經審査合用，卽用以編寫劇本，將來當在片頭上介紹該題村供給人姓氏，以資表揚。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of Germany and Japan concluding an agreement, our government officially stated that the alliance between Germany and Japan has been rumored for over two years, attracting close attention from all countries worldwide. On the evening of the 25th, the German and Japanese governments officially announced the so-called joint anti-communist agreement signed by the two countries. The truth of this matter is gradually becoming clear. The announced agreement consists of only three articles and three protocols. Whether there are other agreements is unknown. Judging from the content of the announced agreement, the main purpose is joint anti-communism. Whether there is a real need for Germany and Japan to jointly prevent communism is a matter for those two countries themselves. Although our country has suffered deeply from communist disasters in the past, through years of suppression and pacification by the government, the communist bandits have been gradually eliminated. The government is confident that it can handle future anti-communist work with self-reliance and that it is purely an internal affair, requiring no consultation with any third party. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports published in local newspapers and general speculation, the reactions of various countries to the German-Japanese agreement can be described as follows: Britain has traditionally maintained the status quo as its policy and firmly opposes any bloc. Therefore, it is impossible to expect it to express goodwill towards the agreement. Furthermore, Britain believes that the agreement directly affects its interests in East Asia, so it cannot but pay serious attention to it. Although Britain will avoid openly opposing the agreement, it will express strong dissatisfaction on the grounds that the organization of a fascist bloc could endanger world peace. As for France, it harbors doubts and concerns that the German-Japanese agreement may turn into a German-Japanese alliance. Moreover, due to the existence of a mutual assistance pact between France and the Soviet Union, France regards any country that forms a bloc with Germany as a dangerous matter. As for the United States, so far only Secretary of State Hull has criticized it, saying that the United States has no direct connection to the German-Japanese agreement. It is generally predicted that Britain, France, and the United States, situated between the communist and anti-communist blocs, often try to ease the suspicions between the two sides. The current agreement is bound to make this kind of suspicion even more extensive and acute, so Britain, France, and the United States will inevitably oppose it. It is said that Rome received the news of the German-Japanese agreement with joy. Italian newspapers stated that since Italy and Germany have already reached an anti-communist understanding, Italy is naturally not the third country mentioned in Article 2 of the German-Japanese agreement. There are many rumors here about the attitude towards China, but it can be summarized as China will maintain the principle of non-capitulation and non-provocation, while also paying attention to the attitudes of Britain, France, the United States, and other neutral countries. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It has been proven here that in addition to the anti-communist agreement announced yesterday, Germany and Japan have also concluded a secret treaty. This matter has aroused even greater anger in all circles of Soviet Russia. Many believe that several negotiations currently underway between Soviet Russia and Japan may be canceled altogether, such as the negotiations for establishing a Soviet-"Manchukuo" border committee in Tokyo and the recent concession of the North Sakhalin oil fields, which are all subject to cancellation. The Soviet authorities have notified Japan that they refuse to sign a fisheries agreement. At present, the leaders of Soviet Russia are extremely busy due to the ongoing All-Union Congress of Soviets and may not have time to issue any official declaration regarding the German-Japanese agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) All circles in Britain suspect that in addition to the announced conditions of the German-Japanese anti-communist agreement, there must be further clauses, or it will be like an iceberg, with what lies beneath the surface being greater than what is visible. However, well-informed sources have not received any confirmed news about the claim that Germany and Japan have agreed on a defensive military alliance. If this is true, then Britain's position in the Far East will naturally be weakened. London now firmly believes that the two countries have concluded a barter agreement, with Japan exchanging its raw materials for German weapons. Judging from the announced conditions, people here feel that the agreement has not changed the overall situation much and is a kind of declaration by the two countries to revive old ties for political reasons. However, Britain ultimately loathes this kind of agreement because it is enough to foster an antagonistic bloc system. This kind of division is contrary to the policies often explained by British Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Secretary of State Moore declared today that the United States is only paying attention to the German-Japanese anti-communist agreement from a scholarly perspective. Well-informed sources here all say that the agreement has no impact on the diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Japan, the U.S. and Russia, and the U.S. and Germany. Diplomatic circles regard this agreement as Germany's retaliation for the French-Soviet mutual assistance pact. Its existence has long been a fact, and today it is merely put into writing. It is said that the Italian government is hesitant to participate in the agreement because Italy is still a member of the League of Nations, while Germany and Japan are not. The French Ambassador to the United States personally visited the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department today, mainly to inquire about the U.S.'s reaction to the agreement. Since Stalin severely criticized fascism when announcing the new constitution, the signing of the agreement has received special attention from the general public. In the afternoon, many newspapers published the news with large headlines. At the same time, it was learned that the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Davies, had originally planned to take a vacation in his hometown for a period of time before taking office, but now he has decided to leave immediately. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos recently delivered a speech at the Council of Ministers, outlining the general situation of the international situation. Regarding the signing of the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, he expressed concern, believing that this agreement is not enough to create a favorable atmosphere for the improvement of relations between Germany and Russia. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Officials here issued an opinion today, believing that the German-Japanese agreement will further shift the balance of international power towards Germany, so the crisis for French security may increase. The agreement will further force France to seek friendship with Britain and the United States. French officials have great hope that France and the United States can cooperate closely in international affairs and solemnly declare that this agreement may have various possible impacts on naval powers in the Pacific. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to responsible sources here, the Italian government is not moved by the German-Japanese anti-communist agreement. They also said that although Rome and Tokyo have the same views, there is no written document. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Sui Military Achieves Victory; A Certain Party's Conspiracy Completely Fails; Zhao Chengzhou Visits Fu Zuoyi to Discuss Military Affairs; Chen Cheng Changes to Flying to Suiyuan This Morning; Central Air Force Participates in the War</h3>
<p>(Guihua) The recovery of Bailingmiao has a great impact on future national defense relations because the temple is a vital passage from Chahar Province through Alxa Ejin to Xinjiang. In recent years, a certain party's conspiracy aimed to organize a so-called "Great Yuan Empire," whose planned territory extended from Jehol west to the border of Xinjiang, including all of Inner Mongolia to the north. After the recovery of Bailingmiao, the center of this route is now in the hands of our army. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) A certain party's conspiracy to organize the so-called "Great Yuan Empire" is said to have a budget of 40 million yuan. As of now, more than 50 million yuan has been spent. Their operation in Bailingmiao was originally intended to be the only military transportation base in northern Suiyuan, so for two months, they have been constantly purchasing large quantities of coal and white flour from Peiping and Tianjin, transporting them to Suiyuan via the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, and then transporting them to Bailingmiao by truck from Guihua every day. This time, when the national army recovered the temple, all of the above fuel and food were completely intercepted, which was something that a certain party did not expect. The people of Suiyuan Province are extremely pleased. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Chen Cheng paid another visit to the cabinet this morning to ask for instructions and changed his trip to Suiyuan to the day after tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Guihua) Li Du sent a telegram to Fu Zuoyi on the 26th, expressing his admiration. Zhao Chengzhou said that there are no traces of bandits in eastern Suiyuan, but enemy planes are constantly scouting. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Central Air Force participated in the Suiyuan war for the first time today. Seven planes took off from Guihua in the morning and scouted enemy traces along the entire front line in northern Suiyuan, up to Bailingmiao. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: Zhao Chengzhou went to Suiyuan on the night of the 25th to visit Fu [Zuoyi] and discuss the military deployment in eastern Suiyuan. Our army believes that Honggetu is still regarded as an attack target by the bandit-puppets. If there is an accident here, the gateway will be lost, so it must be strictly defended. Zhao asked for instructions and then returned to engage in deployment work. A batch of gas masks for the soldiers at the front have arrived. The morale of the army is high, and they are determined to annihilate the enemy. Although it rained heavily on the 26th, they still stood guard on the front without shrinking back. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Hongwen and Hu Shoumin, representatives of the Taiyuan Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters stationed in Peiping, visited Secretary-General Weng [Wenhao] of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 26th to report on the national army's capture of Bailingmiao. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi, in order to facilitate consultation with the central authorities and to contact the central government at any time, given the bandit-puppet harassment and tight border defense in Suiyuan, appointed Zhang Xiaoshan as the director of the Suiyuan Provincial Office in Peiping. Zhang has arrived in Peiping, found a location, and started working. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) When Bailingmiao was recovered, the commander-in-chief at the front was Cavalry Division Commander Sun Changsheng, and the deputy commander-in-chief was Infantry Brigade Commander Sun Lanfeng. An hour before the national army recovered the area, the bandit army sent 5,000 reinforcements to protect it. Later, seeing that the temple had been recovered by the national army, they fled in all directions. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Since the recovery of Bailingmiao, the threat to northern Suiyuan has been eliminated, and the situation in eastern Suiyuan has obviously become tense again. Many believe that the Chinese army will prepare to attack Chahar Province. It is heard that Shangdu has closed its city gates to prevent the Chinese army from attacking. According to sources in Guihua, ten planes from Chahar Province flew to the sky over Bailingmiao yesterday and bombed the lama temple, but the damage was very minor. The puppet army reinforcements of 5,000 men were on their way to Bailingmiao when they heard that the area had been lost and retreated eastward. Not a single enemy plane flew over eastern Suiyuan yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Bandit Planes Bomb Xinghe</p>
<p>(Guihua) The bandit army in the Xinghe area of ​​Suiyuan was defeated by our army. Li Shouxin's troops also dispersed following Wang Ying's troops. However, enemy planes are still scouting and bombing the border of Xinghe, which is extremely cruel. The people of Xinghe have risen up to defend themselves, inflicting heavy blows on the bandits. However, the people of Xinghe long for our planes to be able to drive enemy planes out of the county. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) After our army recovered Bailingmiao, at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th, an enemy plane flew over the temple to scout without dropping bombs. At 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, ten more planes came and flew over the temple, bombing it fiercely. Houses were burned down, and residents died, which was extremely tragic. Our army also suffered casualties. Those wounded in the temple on the 25th were transported to Suiyuan. Fu Zuoyi personally went to visit and comfort them. On the evening of the 25th, the bodies of the officers and soldiers who died attacking the temple were transported to Suiyuan and will be buried with great honor. All circles in Suiyuan held a memorial service at the Martyrs' Park on the morning of the 26th.

<p>A Certain Party Protests the Shooting Down of Planes</p>
<p>(Jining) When our army attacked and captured Bailingmiao, four planes from a certain party dropped bombs on our army. Three of them were shot down by our army. The Kwantung Army Special Service Agency protested to Chairman Fu [Zuoyi], saying that the planes had Japanese national emblems on their wings, and the Chinese army's firing on the planes was tantamount to insulting the Japanese emblem. Observers here all believe that this move by the Japanese side is deeply ridiculous. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai and Others Comfort the Troops in Suiyuan</p>

<h3>Britain Actively Develops Trade with China, Economic Cooperation is Substantial</h3>
<p>(London) Discussions are rife here regarding Britain's participation in China's economic development. Britain is now determined to actively revitalize its trade with China and initiate various industrial and financial plans that will benefit both countries. The China Committee, recently established by the Federation of British Industries, held its first meeting today. The chairman was Sir MacDonough, President of the Federation. Mr. Kilberick Gurick, who is scheduled to depart next month to take up the new position of representative of the Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, delivered a speech at the China Committee today, outlining the intended scope of his activities. It is heard that before the meeting, the committee had a discussion on how various British industries should cooperate to meet China's needs. The above-mentioned activities in Britain show that people in the UK have a deep trust in the political and economic future of China. This is all the result of Sir Leith-Ross's visit to China. It is heard that in order to ensure that the benefits of Sino-British financial and economic cooperation are not biased towards one side, the British side has instructed Mr. Rodgers, an expert from the Bank of England, to remain in China temporarily and continue to assist the Chinese Ministry of Finance with all his strength in the reorganization of the Central Bank, as this is necessary since the monetary reform. Mr. Rodgers is actually not considered a "consultant" to the Chinese government, as his salary and expenses are all borne by the Bank of England. It is highly likely that within a few days, a public announcement will be made that an agreement has been reached on the method of constructing the new Beijing-Jiangxi railway line, connecting Nanjing with the Yuehan Railway. The realization of this important railway project is indeed the result of cooperation between British banks and industrial organizations and the Chinese banking group and the British Boxer Indemnity Fund Management Committee, as all the necessary funds are provided by the aforementioned organizations. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's Financial News wrote that it has been a year since China implemented currency devaluation and reformed its monetary system. During this period, many things have happened that can make holders of Chinese bonds rest easy. The report also mentioned the restoration of foreign exchange balance, saying that this situation has achieved part of its goal due to the reduction of imports. China has been able to make this significant progress because the government has adopted a far-sighted policy. The observations of Sir Leith-Ross, the chief economic advisor to the British government, on China's internal affairs have been recently proven by various developments. Leith-Ross believes that China, under a strong government that has fully won the hearts of the people, is engaged in orderly development, and that this internal revival will gradually eliminate all factors that cause social and political unrest.

The losses were not very large. We hope you will check and make corrections. Respectfully, The Huainan Coal Mine Bureau of the Construction Committee, November 22nd.</p>

<h3>Tung Oil Export Control and Foreign Relations</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>At a time when the issue of the Japan-Germany alliance has aroused public indignation in China and the world, the Shanghai's oversensitive foreign newspapers lightly dragged the rumor of the Chinese government's control of tung oil exports into this issue. According to the North China Daily News, China's attempt to control tung oil was fooled by the Germans. Germany wants to use broken machinery to exchange for China's best raw materials, such as iron ore and tung oil, and then use its guns and explosives to exchange for Manchurian soybeans from Japan. Germany is trying to help the aggressive country in the Far East, which is China's public enemy and also Germany's ally. At this time, China is taking tung oil, etc., which is needed by friendly countries such as Britain and the United States, from the hands of the export industry operated by the capital of friendly countries, and giving it to the government to control. This is a very unwise plan. The North China Daily News said that the Chinese government is fortunate not to have implemented this control plan. If it is implemented, "it will give foreigners a very bad impression, especially Britain and the United States. Britain consumes 16 percent of China's exported tung oil, and the United States accommodates 71 percent. Public opinion in these two countries will rebound, thereby reducing the goodwill and cooperation of these two countries towards China."</p>
<p>We believe that it is unwise to forcibly drag the tung oil issue to the Japan-Germany alliance issue and use our anger at the Japan-Germany alliance to prevent the government from building an important plan for the national defense economy. We know that tung oil exports account for the first place in China's exports, and this raw material is absolutely lacking in the world and has patent properties. Its market is expanding day by day, and it has a life-and-death relationship with China's economy. It must not be allowed to fall into the hands of a few foreign capitalists for a long time, while the government has no control rights. The government's control of tung oil exports is one thing. How to dispose of this raw material after control is another matter. Britain and the United States are our friendly countries and also need our tung oil. We will naturally not ban tung oil exports to these countries. Germany also needs our tung oil. If Germany's Far East policy is unfavorable to our country, or even infringes on our sovereignty, we will ban the supply of tung oil to them. Whether to give or not to give is our right. As for the private investment of British, American, German, Japanese, and other countries in the tung oil export industry and cultivation industry, the government will naturally find ways to minimize its losses. If we bite on Chiang Kai-shek's words of "encouraging foreign investment," thinking that foreign investment in China is absolutely sacred and inviolable, this is too selfish and does not take into account the interests of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>In the statement of the German HNA with official nature (the 22nd newspaper) also mentioned that Manchurian soybeans are a necessity for the German people. Germany has no choice but to exchange machines and medicines with Japan. It seems that exchanging German military fire for Manchurian soybeans is a fact. Although the German side denies the exchange of military fire, if this is the case, Germany's Far East policy is very wrong. Taking away our Manchurian soybeans, but giving tanks and poison gas to the country that invaded us, we cannot tolerate it. We support the government's control of tung oil exports. Using this economic weapon, we can improve our position in international trade in peacetime and impose sanctions on aggressor countries in wartime. We oppose delaying policies related to our national interests in order to protect the private interests of a few foreigners. Recently, Sir Leith-Ross told the British that "the current danger is not that China's progress is too slow, but that it is trying to develop too fast." We fear that China's progress is not fast enough. To build the economic foundation of the nation, we should move forward without any scruples.</p>
<h3>War in the Capital Region of Spain Yesterday Morning, People's Defense Forces on the Southern Front Counterattacked, Rebel Aircraft Continued Bombing</h3>
<p>Talavera, special report from our reporter, the former frontier near Madrid was calm and uneventful last night. This morning, the war resumed. The National Army attempted to advance towards the village of Argales in the suburbs. Although the government forces resisted stubbornly, the National Army still occupied several houses on both sides of Los Rosales Street. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Lisbon, when thousands of reinforcements of the Spanish National Army rushed to the front line of Madrid today to prepare for a new offensive, 1,500 elite troops of the government army suddenly launched a fierce attack on Talavera, 70 miles behind their line. At the same time, the people's defense forces gathered in Santo Tomé, 15 miles to the south, carrying artillery batteries with three-inch and four-inch caliber cannons, suddenly pounced on Talavera. After one hour of bombardment, they gained a foothold on the outskirts of the town, but were forced to retreat after a counterattack by the National Army. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid, after the aircraft belonging to the National Army bombed this city twice yesterday, only a few people were injured. One shell hit the army hospital, but there were no deaths or injuries. One shell also hit a hotel, and the three-story building was completely destroyed, but no one was injured. After a private residence was hit, several people were injured. Several shells fell near the North Station, and several members of the people's defense forces were injured as a result. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid, the weather has been fine in recent days, and the aircraft of the National Army continued to bomb this city. At 9 am and 3 pm today, they bombed twice in succession. The bombs dropped mostly fell in quiet areas. The number of casualties was not as high as before, and the material losses were also relatively light. The National Army aircraft were unable to drop bombs in the city center, probably because the government's aircraft immediately took off to fight back. The anarchist General Confederation of Labor radio station has issued a broadcast message saying that the National Army launched a large-scale attack on the old palace area of Mengluoa in the northwest suburbs, but was eventually defeated by the government army. The government army's position in the Gasatgangba Park area in the west suburbs has made progress. It also stated that the National Army cruiser "Canarias" is now carrying Moroccan soldiers across the Strait of Gibraltar, protected by three German warships. In addition, according to the broadcast war report released by the National Defense Committee, the government army's aircraft shot down one National Army aircraft. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>German Embassy and Consulates Search Reveals Military Arms, and Important Documents Discovered Proving Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Rome officially announced that the Italian Embassy in Madrid has been looted. At the same time, German newspapers also published protest texts because they received news that the German Embassy in West Beijing was broken into and searched. It is said that before the above two incidents occurred, the West government had ordered the personnel of the German and Italian embassies to withdraw within 24 hours because Germany and Italy recognized the National Government led by Franco. According to a Reuters reporter in Madrid, after the German embassy personnel withdrew, the Spanish police found more than 30 members of the Spanish Fascist Party in the embassy. It was announced that the embassy had been armed, and they had found a large number of military fire, including machine guns and hand grenades, and a large number of bullets were stored. The Minister of Internal Affairs of the Spanish government in Valencia claimed that the Spanish police recently searched the uninhabited German consulate in Cartagenna, and found a large number of extremely important documents related to espionage activities, and also found many searchlights and gas masks.

<h3>Russian Ship in Gibraltar Attacked by Rebel Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Gibraltar, today in the Strait of Gibraltar, there was an accidental conflict between a Russian transport ship and a fishing boat belonging to the Spanish National Army. The fishing boat opened fire on the bow of the Russian transport ship for reasons unknown. The Russian ship was passing through the strait from west to east.

It is generally believed that after this incident, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Spanish National Army will become more and more deteriorated. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Naval Review in the Mediterranean Sea to Welcome Hungarian Guests, Grand Banquet in the Roman Palace</h3>
<p>Port of Naples, more than 100 Italian warships have recently gathered in this port this morning to welcome Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy. This is the largest Italian naval review since the European War. King Emmanuel III, Crown Prince Bimon, and Admiral Horthy and his party arrived here by train at 10:35 this morning. Officials and people lined up to welcome them, and the cheers were deafening. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Italian government held a grand naval review in Naples to welcome Hungarian Regent Horthy, Prime Minister Daranyi, and Foreign Minister Kanya, who were visiting Italy to report on their duties. The Italian King and Mussolini personally accompanied the above-mentioned Hungarian guests and boarded the cruiser "Zara" to review the Italian navy. The cruiser sailed out of the port of Naples at a speed of 25 nautical miles per hour. When Mussolini traveled from Rome to Naples, he took his own plane and drove it himself. After the review was completed, Italy held a banquet in the Roman Palace to entertain Horthy and his party. Many officials from Italy and Hungary attended the banquet. After the Italian King raised his glass to wish Regent Horthy health, he continued with a speech. He said that the harmony of the existing friendship between the two countries and the ways to connect the people of Italy and Hungary are many, but in the past ten years, the relationship between the people of the two countries has become more and more consolidated due to the same goals. The common goal of Italy and Hungary is to seek political peace and justice. The Italian King also expressed the hope that after Horthy and others return to their country, they will be able to convey the Italian government and people's concern and sincerity towards Hungary to their people. The Italian King finally said, "We respectfully hope that the efforts of your people will be successful." Horthy stood up and replied, saying that he was deeply moved by the Italian King's sincere speech and expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from all walks of life in Italy. He was very pleased to have the opportunity to express the Hungarian people's friendship and admiration for Italy. Under the leadership of the current King and Prime Minister Mussolini, Italy has established itself as an Italian colonial empire. He took this opportunity to express the congratulations of the Hungarian government and people. Hungary knows that Italy is willing to engage in peaceful construction work and hopes that both countries can uphold this same highest concept, so that they can cooperate with each other in the future to protect the noble principles of peace and justice.

<h3>Singapore Port Construction Project, Lindsay Conducts On-site Inspection, Impression is Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>(Singapore) Mr. Lindsay, a senior official of the British Admiralty, recently came to Singapore and inspected the naval base here in detail. He expressed great satisfaction with the progress of the construction work there and said that the impression he had gained this time had confirmed the psychology of the general British people's belief that this project would be extremely perfect. Mr. Lin also hoped that the people here would not misunderstand what he said about Australia and New Zealand giving a lot of help to Singapore's defense plan. He said, "It should be known that New Zealand has indeed donated a lot of funds for the naval base here. Australia, on the other hand, has agreed with the British government to station a powerful fleet of cruisers in the Pacific, which is the same as directly donating funds to the base. The government has recognized the willingness of the free territories to join the Singapore defense plan and firmly believes that this kind of voluntary cooperation will continue for a long time." Someone asked Mr. Lin whether the construction of the Singapore base would be suspended again after the British Labor Party regained power. Mr. Lin replied that he was an official of the current government and it was difficult for him to predict the policies of the opposition party. However, the construction work has progressed to the current level, and even if it is to be suspended, it may be impossible. Mr. Lin decided to stay in New Zealand for three days and visited the Royal Air Force base, the naval radio station, and various construction works related to the defense of New Zealand. Mr. Lin has taken a plane to Australia. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Situation in Spain, Decides to Ban the Shipment of Military Fire to Spain</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, it discussed the Spanish incident. Foreign Secretary Eden announced that the British government had decided to prohibit British ships from shipping military fire to Spain, but food and coal were not included in the ban. In order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Madrid, General Franco has agreed to expand the safe area of Madrid by approximately one square mile at the request of the British and other ambassadors. After this expansion, the embassies of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries are all within the safe area. The Foreign Secretary is confident that this area can ensure the safety of non-combatants of all countries. A member asked about a certain incident that violated the non-interference agreement. The Foreign Secretary replied that after October 15, some countries were still shipping military fire to Spain. The Non-Interference Steering Committee has obtained evidence and has considered it. The Foreign Secretary described the news that the Norwegian merchant ship Lisken had been arrested, saying that this was obviously an incident of the Norwegian government, and the British government was not in a position to initiate a protest. It was found that the ship had arrived in Gibraltar a few days ago, and its owner had reported to the naval authorities there that it had been blocked and questioned by two Spanish rebel armed fishing boats 10 miles off Cape Finisterre on November 15, and ordered to go to Vigo with a fishing boat. The owner refused to obey because the ship was on the high seas. As a result, armed teams boarded the ship, escorted the ship to the port of Vigo, and confiscated the sweet potatoes and seeds that were transported to the Spanish government. The Foreign Secretary continued to say that the ship is still anchored in Gibraltar awaiting orders. Labor Party member Barker urged the government to order British warships in Spanish waters to report events such as foreign submarines attacking Spanish government warships, as such events could lead to international war. Maritime Minister Hall replied that we should not interfere in matters that are not related to Britain. This is what the British government pays special attention to. He did not receive any information that would allow him to express any opinion on the issue. Hall also replied to a question, saying that the government had received a report from the British destroyer Glowworm, saying that the Spanish government cruiser Cervantes had been damaged by a torpedo in the port of Cartagena on November 22.

<h3>The Process of Concluding the Japan-Germany Agreement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Agreement is the result of long-term cooperation between the two countries. As early as when the Saito cabinet came to power, Japanese diplomacy had placed emphasis on seeking cooperation from other major powers to resist international Bolshevism. Later, during the Okada cabinet, this policy was continued. The actual start of negotiations was 18 months ago. With the establishment of the Hirota cabinet, the process was accelerated. In March of this year, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji returned to Japan to take office, carrying with him the specific proposals decided by the Hirota cabinet. After Ambassador Mushanokoji arrived in Germany, he met with Military Attaché Oshima stationed in Germany and Minister to Sweden Shiratori to proceed separately and seek Germany's consent. The signing of the Franco-Soviet Agreement made the organization of the German anti-communist group more necessary than before. The Japanese cabinet also passed the draft of the Japan-Germany Agreement in July of this year and immediately sent instructions to Mushanokoji to make further arrangements. At the same time, Germany summoned its ambassador and military attaché stationed in Japan back to the country to study the content of the agreement. The negotiations were finally completed at the end of October. The Hirota cabinet formally passed it on October 10 and submitted it to the Privy Council for review. The Privy Council convened a meeting the next day (11th) to decide to conduct a thorough review of the agreement. After the review committee's two reviews on November 13 and 18, the entire case was passed. Hours before the agreement was signed in Berlin on November 25, it finally received the official approval of the Privy Council. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita invited the British and French envoys to Japan to his official residence at 10:30 pm on the 25th to explain that the Japan-Germany Agreement, in addition to what was published, did not contain any secret military clauses. The agreement also did not contain any anti-Soviet nature. At the same time, Arita also instructed all envoys stationed abroad to make the same explanation to the governments where they were stationed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>Stalin's Speech: Challenging Fascism, Proposing Amendments to the Constitution, Forming a Military-Industrial Committee</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin delivered a three-hour speech at the opening of the All-Union Congress today, boldly challenging fascism. Stalin stated that the new constitution to be discussed and passed by the congress is a condemnation of fascism and will inspire all civilized nations to rise up and fight for democracy to resist fascist barbarism. The only amendment he proposed to the draft constitution was the establishment of a new Military-Industrial Committee, which should quickly become the world's largest military organization. Stalin strongly criticized those who advocate depriving clergymen and former White Guards of the right to vote, saying that the Soviet Union has completely diminished the influence of the old opposition and is not afraid of any party's sabotage. He continued that the draft constitution is an expression of the existing state of affairs, guaranteeing workers' employment, education, and rest, which is clearly different from the constitutions of middle-class societies, which only declare the rights of workers without realizing them. The golden age of socialism has arrived, as the property of landlords and capitalists has been nationalized, and the system of exploitation of people by people has been abolished, etc. More than two thousand delegates attended, representing 160 different ethnic groups such as Caucasians, Tartars, and Eskimos. After listening to Stalin's speech, the audience cheered for twenty minutes. The speech was broadcast nationwide by radio. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Ukrainian Republic Premier Lyubachenko spoke at the All-Union Congress today, strongly condemning Germany and Japan. He said that Germany and Japan are preparing to launch a "crusade" against the Soviet Union. Hitler will never see our Ukrainian gardens. I now warn the National Socialist Party that invading Ukraine will be more difficult than entering the Rhineland. If they dare to approach the Soviet border, the Red Army will surely strike them head-on, etc. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Soviet Congress: Over Two Thousand Delegates Attend, Stalin Proposes a New Constitution</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union opened here at the Kremlin at 5:00 PM today to discuss the draft of the new Soviet constitution. There were 2,337 delegates from across the country and many guests. When Stalin, the author of the new constitution and leader of the Soviet people, appeared on the podium, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers that lasted for a long time. Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Ordzhonikidze, and other party and government leaders who accompanied Stalin on stage were also warmly welcomed by the entire audience. Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, delivered a short speech, officially announcing the opening of the congress. The congress then elected a presidium of thirty people, including Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Ordzhonikidze, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Zhdanov, Kossior, Petrovsky, Chubar, Rudzutak, Litvinov, etc. Stalin then stood up to report on the draft of the new Soviet constitution, and the entire audience responded with warm applause. Many members of the diplomatic corps from various countries and representatives of the foreign press attended the congress. (TASS, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The All-Union Congress of Soviets has two thousand delegates in attendance, bringing together villagers from the highlands of Asia and elegantly dressed Europeans in one place, a colorful and innumerable gathering. Many delegates traveled for more than a month to get here, starting their journey with reindeer sleds, dog sleds, and camels, and only able to take trains and airplanes where transportation was convenient. However, after arriving here, most of the delegates have changed into European attire, so very few still wear their native clothing. The meeting place is the St. Peter's Great Hall, which has been transformed from its appearance three years ago. The former venue for aristocratic social gatherings has now been transformed into a very large conference hall, with loudspeakers installed all around, and the delegates' desks and chairs are also very comfortable. The meeting times are from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM and from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM, etc. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The All-Russian Soviet Party Congress opened here today, with Stalin proposing a new draft constitution that includes expanding freedom of speech and belief, guaranteeing the secrecy of correspondence, implementing unrestricted suffrage for citizens over the age of eighteen, and racial equality. This constitution is expected to be passed within a few days.</p>
<p>Stalin also delivered a speech via radio broadcast today, saying, "Capitalism has been completely eliminated in Soviet Russia, and socialism has been permanently established. The international significance of this constitution is beyond exaggeration. Recently, fascism has been rampant, affecting many of the world's outstanding nations. After the new Soviet constitution is passed in a few days, it will be an important anti-fascist action and can serve as a moral support for those who are fighting for democracy."</p>
<p>According to this constitution, which was approved by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union in mid-June this year, it will likely be slightly revised during this congress and then passed as originally planned. After the congress adjourns, it will be dissolved, and a two-house legislative body will be established based on the new constitution. Its name will be the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, with one representative elected for every 300,000 people, roughly similar to the organization of the American government, except that Soviet Russia will remain a one-party dictatorship. The two houses of the Supreme Soviet are the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities, with equal powers. However, after the new electoral law is implemented, it will slightly reduce the power of workers in cities to manipulate elections. Representatives of the Council of Nationalities are elected by the Soviet Parliaments and autonomous republics, with each Soviet republic electing ten representatives, each autonomous republic five, and each autonomous province two. The new constitution also stipulates that the socialist economic system, ownership of the means of production, and methods of production, etc., are the economic foundation of the Soviet Union. All able-bodied citizens have the obligation to work. According to the principles of the constitution, "He who does not work shall not eat." Personal property and personal items acquired by citizens through labor and savings are protected by law. Small-scale private farms and other individual enterprises of farmers and workers, which are based on individual labor and do not employ workers, are also permitted by law.</p>
<p>The constitution also stipulates the obligations and rights of citizens. In terms of rights, the state guarantees the people's right to work and education, freedom of speech, assembly, and demonstration, and no one can be arrested without a court order. Private correspondence can be kept secret, and freedom of religious belief and promotion of anti-religious propaganda are both permitted. Men and women are equal in all aspects of economic, political, social, and national life. All ethnic groups within the country are also completely equal. Anyone who restricts ethnic rights or promotes ethnic opinions will be punished. As for obligations, they include serving in the military, protecting public property, obeying laws and labor discipline. The new constitution</p>
<h3>Arrested German Engineer: Soviet Union Reduces Sentence to Ten Years, Six Other Russians Executed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Soviet authorities have reduced the death sentence of German engineer Steckelring to ten years in prison, which may prevent a rupture in relations between Russia and Germany. As for the eight Russians who were convicted of sabotage in the Siberian mining area along with Steckelring and sentenced to death, two of them also had their sentences reduced to ten years in prison. The remaining six, who were accused of being the masterminds of sabotage activities by a certain counter-revolutionary group, have already been executed. Meanwhile, the German Embassy in Moscow is still investigating the details of the arrest of German expatriates Boetz and two others on Saturday. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the semi-official newspaper "Echo de Paris," the Soviet authorities' reduction of the German engineer's death sentence to ten years' imprisonment was influenced by the friendly protests of Britain and France. (National Telegram, 26th) In addition, five new Soviet republics were established. The original Transcaucasian Federation has been changed into the three republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. Previously, the two republics of Kazakh and Kyrgyz were also established in the Russian Federation. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the German-Japanese Agreement: Recovering from Isolation and Surrounding Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese political observers, one of the purposes of the Japanese-German Anti-Communist Agreement is to enable the two countries to achieve closer cooperation to encircle the Soviet Union. Japan hopes that putting pressure on the Soviet Union in the west will eliminate the threat it poses to Japan in the Far East. Therefore, Japan will take more active and stronger steps towards the Soviet Union, which is bound to happen. The Soviet Union's hatred of Japan will also increase as a result, and the future danger will be greater than it is now. As far as relations with China are concerned, it is expected that China and the Soviet Union will become closer. The future relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan cannot be guaranteed to be optimistic, as Japan has given Britain and the United States the impression that Japan has joined the fascist camp. Observers also pointed out that the current agreement shows that Japan's speculative policy adopted after the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and its isolation policy adopted since the Manchurian Incident will undergo fundamental changes, ushering in a new era and actively promoting its continental policy with a clear goal. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today have a calm, worried, and doubtful attitude towards the Japanese-German Anti-Communist Agreement, which is quite evident. Regarding the reactions expressed by various Japanese newspapers, the impression gained by the Central News Agency correspondent can be summarized as follows: (1) Almost all newspapers firmly hope that the Japanese government should strictly adhere to and not overstep the scope of the announced agreement, avoid any actions that have the suspicion of an alliance, and make the greatest efforts to dispel the various misunderstandings arising from the signing of the agreement. (2) Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, they should be improved and not be allowed to deteriorate as a result. (3) Although the statement from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the current agreement does not intend to form any alliance, it is highly doubtful whether Japan's political tendencies are becoming more fascist or national socialist. (4) Many newspapers are questioning whether the need for German assistance in anti-communism is entirely necessary. (5) Generally, there are concerns that Japan's cooperation with Germany will abandon its independent foreign policy or hinder the implementation of Japan's future national policy. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese circles have the following views on the conclusion of the Anti-Communist Agreement between Japan and Germany:</p>
<p>Sakurauchi, Secretary-General of the Minseito Party, said, "The purpose of the Japanese-German agreement is to prevent the intrusion of communist forces from the north and is not aimed at the Soviet Union or other specific countries. It is natural for Japan to jointly defend against communism with countries that have the same purpose."</p>
<p>Ando, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai Party, said, "There are two major reasons for Japan and Germany to conclude an agreement. First, Japan has shifted from isolated diplomacy to alliance diplomacy. Second, the ideology of communism and its political organization are the reasons. The scope of the agreement is limited to anti-communism and does not regard the Soviet Union as an enemy country. All of our citizens should understand that national relations treat all countries equally." Secretary-General Aso of the Social Mass Party said, "Since the Manchurian Incident, Japan has been isolated in the world and has stood on its own to implement anti-communism. Japan should maintain this position and actively defend against communism as the main task." Financial circles believe that the conclusion of the Japanese-German agreement will enable cooperation in anti-communism with various countries and promote friendly relations with various countries. The current agreement can also promote trade relations between Japan, Manchuria, and Germany. As Japan is now strengthening its military preparations and expanding various military industries, it is necessary to increase the number of machines imported from Germany, and technological cooperation in other industries will also bring good results.

<h3>Foreign Minister Arita Pleased: Embracing Hitler's Portrait, Japanese Newspapers Comment on the Pros and Cons of the Agreement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When Foreign Minister Arita received a phone call from Berlin at his official residence and learned that the Japanese-German Anti-Communist Agreement had been signed, he happily picked up a portrait of the German leader Hitler and embraced it. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a banquet to celebrate. British Ambassador to Japan Clive and the US Chargé d'Affaires were also invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, informed that the agreement had been signed, and provided with the agreement documents. Japanese newspapers are paying attention to the reactions of Britain and the United States to the agreement. The Asahi Shimbun reported that before the agreement was completed, Japan explained its true intentions and sought the understanding of Britain and the United States, fearing that the two countries would hastily conclude that Japan had joined the fascist group. The report also said that Britain refused to express its opinion, but the general atmosphere was opposed to the agreement. Some British people believe that this is directly related to Britain's interests in the Far East. However, it is noteworthy that Japan and Germany have been isolated internationally since leaving the League of Nations, and now they have abandoned isolation and taken a step towards solid international cooperation in the form of mutual security guarantees. The Jiji Shinpo reported that the purpose of the agreement is to organize an encirclement of Soviet Russia so that Japan or Germany can take a tough policy toward Soviet Russia. Japan no longer has to worry about the threat of Soviet Russia's Far East army. The above situation seems to be the result of Japan's adoption of an active and tough policy toward Soviet Russia. The newspaper also said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally believed that after the conclusion of this agreement, the disagreements between Japan and other countries might be considerably reduced, but this may not be the case in practice. The thorns in the future of Japan's diplomatic relations are just beginning to grow. Well-informed sources believe that after the conclusion of the Japanese-German agreement, China and Russia may become closer, and at the same time, Japan's efforts to increase friendly relations with Britain and the United States may not be able to be achieved smoothly. At present, Japan must temporarily abandon the opportunism and leaning policy adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and move forward with a truly constructive and autonomous foreign policy.

<h3>German Declaration</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently broadcast on the radio the full text of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" concluded between Germany and Japan today, resolutely representing Head of State Hitler and the German government, reading the declaration, which stated: "The two great nations of Germany and Japan, now joining hands resolutely, officially announce their firm attitude of not retreating and not yielding to the red bandits. It is obvious that this agreement is only a defensive action, as neither of the two signing countries has challenged the Comintern. However, the Comintern uses various revolutionary and rebellious provocative methods to create disasters and panic around the world, so the two signing countries have to guard against it. The Comintern's trend seriously threatens the entire civilized world and illegally manipulates the most sacred virtues of all nations. Fortunately, Germany and the German people are now fully strong and will not be destroyed by Bolshevism. Since Head of State Hitler took office, the Red International in Moscow has used various means to restore its lost position in Germany and to instigate and incite the whole world to rise up against Germany. To this day, the Comintern still wants to launch a holy war against the National Socialist Party to annihilate Germany. However, this attempt to encircle Germany has failed one after another. Germany's borders are now guarded by strong armies. If the Comintern invades our country, we will resolutely repel it and even punish it. We have already said this at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress. The recent events in Spain are sufficient to show the necessity of expanding the anti-Bolshevik struggle. From this, it can be seen that the purpose of the agreement concluded by the two great civilized countries is to clear away the brutal attempts of the Comintern. It should be known that the German and Japanese nations do not want to provoke other countries, but they will not allow other countries to provoke them." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the newspapers seem calm about the news of the conclusion of the German-Japanese agreement, and their comments vary depending on the party. The Morning Post said that the published full text has no special shocking points. It is nothing more than a mutual cooperation to curb the malicious activities of the Comintern. The Daily Herald regarded the agreement as a blatant attack by the Fascists on the Soviet Union, a more threatening step forward, and said that the entire attitude of the agreement can be summarized in one word: aggression. The Daily Telegraph said that if the agreement does not have secret clauses, it lacks important relations. As for its importance, it lies in its temperament, and its content is even more decisive. The Times said that the publication of the clauses of the agreement has reduced the fear caused by secrecy. The agreement does not mention Soviet Russia, and the wording of its anti-communist declaration makes it difficult for Soviet Russia to oppose it with the true will to "become husband and wife" to resist malicious activities. The report also said that outside rumors that the agreement delineates the economic spheres of influence of Germany and Japan in the Dutch East Indies will eventually turn into political spheres of influence. This development will have repercussions on Britain's position in Hong Kong and Singapore. This statement is not entirely without cause. The report concluded that this development, whether it is premeditated or not, seems that Japan's invasion of China will greatly increase its speed due to the German-Japanese agreement. The agreement has greatly reduced Japan's fear of the Manchurian border. The Manchester Guardian said that the most important and most worrying part of the Japanese-German agreement is its second section. The unique use of the word "foreign" in the text has eliminated all the assumptions that this agreement is defensive in nature, and the phrase "take a severe plan" to control those who indirectly work for the Third International is sufficient to include everything from interfering in the Spanish civil war to openly attacking Czechoslovakia and North China. This agreement is nominally anti-communist, but in fact it is an anti-Soviet Russian agreement. The most intelligent propagandist cannot use his eloquence to convince people that Germany can "defend" Spain or Czechoslovakia without illegal aggression. If Germany's actions cannot be determined, it cannot be hastily concluded whether Japan will wage war against Russia, although Japan will most likely take this opportunity to further invade China. The threat of cooperation is the most terrifying factor in the agreement. The agreement, at its lowest estimate, is a bluff, but in the past two years, bluffing has become the strongest force in Europe. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Secret Clauses</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic reporter of the Evening Standard reported that, according to reliable sources, the "Anti-Comintern Pact" signed by Germany and Japan in Berlin has a secret protocol, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The Dutch East Indies will be divided into the economic spheres of influence of Germany and Japan. (2) Resolve the issue of Germany's pre-war possessions in the Pacific islands. The first provision stipulates that the Java Sea, Banda Sea, and Arafura Sea will be used as the boundary to divide the economic spheres of influence of Germany and Japan. In other words, Borneo and Celebes in the Dutch East Indies will be used as Japan's sphere of influence, while Sumatra and Java will be used as Germany's sphere of influence. Regarding the second item, it is heard that Germany has stated that it will renounce all rights to the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands, which were previously owned in the Pacific (currently under Japanese mandate).

<h3>Japanese Kwantung and North China Armies: Important Meeting in Tianjin, Itagaki Leads Staff to Tianjin to Participate, Direct Participation in the War as the Final Decision</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Muto, Chief of the Second Section, Takeshita, Chief of the Third Section, Ono, Staff Officer, and others flew from Changchun to Tianjin on a Japanese military plane at 12:05 noon on the 24th. They landed in front of the Japanese barracks in Limingzhuang, where Commander of the Japanese Army, Tashiro, led his staff, including Chief of Staff Hashimoto, to welcome them. They immediately went to the Yingrong Villa in the Japanese Concession to rest. At 1:00 PM, Itagaki and others visited Tashiro at the Haiguang Temple headquarters. Tashiro summoned a meeting of senior staff from the Kwantung and North China Armies. Participants from the Japanese Army Command in North China included Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Staff Officers Iida, Wachi, Adachi, Asai, Ikeda, Kai, Tsukada, Nagamine, Suzuki, and Adjutants Kawada and Sasaki, along with Muto, Takeshita, and Ono from the Japanese Kwantung Army Command, and Japanese military attachés in Peiping Matsumuro, Imai, Hamada, etc., totaling more than 30 people. The discussion started at 1:00 PM and ended at 4:00 PM. During the meeting, Hashimoto and Wachi reported separately. After the meeting, Tashiro held a banquet at his official residence in Zhangyuan at 6:00 PM to entertain Itagaki and others. This meeting was held before the news of the recovery of Bailingmiao by our army was heard. When the report came from Zhangbei at night, the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin was quite shocked and immediately convened an emergency meeting at the Zhangyuan official residence at 10:00 PM. Except for Matsumuro, Imai, and Hamada, who had returned to Peiping, the number of attendees was the same as before. The discussion was extremely secret and did not end until 0:30 AM on the 25th. It was reportedly decided at that time that Muto and Ono would be sent to Peiping on the morning of the 25th to meet with Matsumuro and then fly to Zhangjiakou with Imai on a Huittong Company plane to Zhangbei, Shangdu, Bailingmiao, Wuchuan, and other places for reconnaissance and to instruct Li Shou-hsin, Wang Ying, Bao Yuyueqing, and others on the appropriate measures. Itagaki and Takeshita flew to Tongzhou with Hashimoto, Wachi, and Senda at 8:00 AM and planned to fly to Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other areas from Peiping on the 26th to investigate the situation and consult with Prince De. They will return to Changchun before the 28th. How to directly participate in the Suiyuan affairs after this will be made public in early next month. Also, on the morning of the 25th, Yoshioka, a senior staff officer of the Japanese 7th Division stationed in Jehol, and Staff Officer Hakamada rushed to Tianjin for military liaison and met with Tashiro and Itagaki. In the afternoon, they hurried to Peiping and then went to Chahar and Suiyuan for investigation. Judging from the actions and attitudes of the Japanese military personnel, it can be seen that their attitude toward the Suiyuan Incident will change from being behind the scenes to being in front of the stage.</p>
<p>At this important meeting of Japanese military personnel in Tianjin, the opinions of the Kwantung and North China Armies were initially quite contradictory. The North China Army Command advocated that the Suiyuan issue should be appropriately stopped because North China is currently in the midst of economic development and stabilizing people's hearts. If the incident expands, everything will be halted, and there will be no way to attract Chinese investment. If this special situation and regime can be maintained and gradually implemented, one-third of their ideal plan can be realized after one year. However, the Japanese Kwantung Army Command believed that with the successful conclusion of the German-Japanese alliance, if they did not first open up Inner Mongolia to eliminate the Soviet Union, they would miss the opportunity and let the Soviet Union have any way to appear, and it would not be easy to deal with. Currently, the strength of the puppet Mongolian army is weak. If the Japanese side does not directly participate, there will be no day to achieve the desired goal. The naval attaché in North China also wanted to take the opportunity to establish merit and echoed this idea. Therefore, the final result of the meeting was to adopt the position of the Japanese Kwantung Army. (25th)</p>
<h3>Our Army Recovers Bailingmiao; Bandit-Puppet Troops Plan to Attack Northern Sui; General Offensive Originally Scheduled to Begin on the 27th; Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shihai Appointed Commanders; De Wang Suddenly Flees Jiabusi with Entourage; Puppet Troops from Rehe Rush to Tusi</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shangdu: Bandit-puppets in Northern Chahar, under the protection of a certain party, invaded the Sui border and suffered heavy losses. Wang Ying, who was allowed to attack Taolin Honggeertu, suffered the greatest losses. Puppet Regiment Commander Zhao Dazhong was executed by his own troops, and Puppet Regiment Commander Chang Ziyi of the Special Task Force was also killed by the Sui army. Su Meilong led his troops in a revolt. Bandit casualties were even greater. Therefore, not only was morale low among his subordinates, but also the attitude of a certain party towards Wang became colder than before. Currently, Wang's puppet troops number only about 3,000. On the 22nd of this month, they began to move to Northern Sui in succession. Nearly ten thousand Mongolian soldiers are now gathering on the border of Northern Sui. The Mongolian troops of Zhuo Shihai's unit, stationed in Niuyangqun, are also moving to Northern Sui. Bao Yueqing also plans to go to Northern Sui within days. After merging with Wang Ying's troops, they plan to advance westward towards Wuchuan, Guyang in Northern Sui. However, amidst the collapse of various bandit-puppet units and renewed calls for active reorganization, De Wang, the puppet government's president and commander-in-chief, suddenly fled Jiabusi with many followers. It is rumored that De Wang may have ulterior motives. His sudden departure from that location seems to confirm these rumors. However, after De's departure, all military and political affairs have been taken over by a certain country's advisor. On the night of the 22nd, the advisor convened a secret meeting in Shangdu, gathering many commanders from various mixed bandit-puppet troops. It is vaguely heard that a decision has been made regarding the plan to attack from Northern Sui. Three strong units are being selected from the bandit-puppet troops to serve as the main force for the Northern Sui offensive. However, the selected units have not yet been announced. Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shihai are both said to be considered for command positions. It is scheduled that the attack on Northern Sui will begin on the 27th of this month.</p>
<p>The bandit-puppets failed to gain ground in Honggeertu, and the traitor Zhang Wanqing suffered another defeat in Nanhaogou. On the 22nd, the traitor Li Shouxin personally commanded Zhang Wanqing's troops and several thousand puppet troops newly arrived from Rehe in a fierce attack on Xinghe. At the same time, large tanks and aircraft from a certain country provided support, but they still failed to succeed. However, the area west of Nanhaogou was severely damaged by bandit-puppet aircraft and artillery fire. The front door of the Catholic church was also destroyed by bombing, and twelve villages were burned down by the bandits, almost turning into scorched earth. The situation is extremely tragic. The puppet troops on that route, with Li Shouxin having a larger number of troops, have their elite forces concentrated in this area and the Daqinggou area. Therefore, Li personally came to command. On the night of the 22nd, more than a thousand puppet troops from Rehe arrived at Nanhaogou from Guyuan. It is expected that the traitor Li will wait for these puppet troops to arrive before launching another attack. It is anticipated that around the 27th, when the great battle in Northern Sui begins, there will also be fierce fighting in Nanhaogou, Xinghe. Puppet troops from Rehe have been continuously entering Duolun, Guyuan, and Weichang in Northern Chahar in recent days, gradually advancing westward. Among them, there are many soldiers from a certain country. It is heard that two to three thousand people arrived in Zhanyuan on the 21st and 22nd, and are heading west to Nanhaogou in succession. Ten thousand people have arrived in Duolun, mostly heading to Kangbao Baochang. As for military supplies, Zhangbei County is the base for bandit-puppet military supplies, and can also be called the main artery for bandit-puppet transportation and supply. On the 22nd, more than sixty vehicles carrying coal and food were transported from Zhangbei to Nanhaogou and Shangdu. Since the start of the military campaign, an average of over a hundred trucks have been entering and exiting Zhangbei every day. Currently, the bandit-puppets have secretly dispatched over thirty plainclothes agents to lurk near Chaigoubu, planning to seize the opportunity to sabotage the PingSui railway tracks and blow up the Yanghe railway bridge there, attempting to cut off transportation. They are currently operating in secret. Furthermore, several aircraft from a certain country stationed in Shangdu are flying to Wuchuan and Guyang in Northern Sui every day for reconnaissance.

<h3>Unprecedented Fire in Nanning City; Two-Thirds of Linjiang Street Destroyed; Property Loss Valued at Over 500,000</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Nanning: At 6:30 PM on the 14th of this month, an unprecedented fire broke out on Linjiang Street, one li east of the city. The origin of the fire was at No. 22 Linjiang Street, east one li, the residence of Liang Wenxing, who runs a oiled paper business. His wife, Liang Huangshi, carries firewood to various firewood shops every day, using the income to help with the family's daily expenses. At 6 PM on that day, a fire started in their house. Before long, it had spread, leading to such a tragic event. When the flames soared to the roof, they were first spotted by patrol officers Huang Liangxing and Zeng Sheng of that section. They immediately blew their whistles and rushed into the house, hoping to extinguish the fire. However, given the high autumn weather and strong winds, the fire spread rapidly with the wind, making it impossible to stop. Furthermore, many businesses on the street deal in firewood, which is highly flammable, so the fire grew increasingly fierce. By the time the fire reached No. 24, the fire engines had not yet arrived. Residents of Linjiang Street, Qisheng Street, and Zhongshan Street saw the situation and called their children, carried boxes, and moved belongings, fleeing in disarray. The scene was chaotic. Pedestrians crowded to watch, blocking the Nanning South Gate Road. Those affected by the disaster cried out in anguish, a heart-wrenching sound. Police Chief Zhou of the Public Security Bureau heard the news and personally led the security team to the scene to maintain order, while supervising the engineering team to put out the fire. Before long, the public dragged water hoses and fire pumps to assist in the firefighting efforts. At the same time, the Gendarmerie Battalion and the Special Service Battalion also arrived at the scene to maintain order, to prevent petty thieves from taking advantage of the fire. However, there was a lack of fire engines and poor maintenance. In addition, the wind was strong, making it difficult to obtain water. The firefighting personnel were also not skilled enough, resulting in the fire spreading uncontrollably, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>It was found that the initial firefighting teams all thought that the fire was heading south, so only one engine started firefighting at the New Pier. The rest were concentrated in the South Gate vegetable market, waiting for water to fight the fire. On the other hand, firefighters used spears to demolish the beams and wood of nearby unaffected houses to prevent the fire from spreading. Unexpectedly, a north wind suddenly blew, and the fire on the city side stopped slightly, while the old Puqing Theater was already engulfed in flames. Seeing this, the firefighting teams divided into groups and directed the fire hoses to the side of the Lingxi School. Another group bypassed the north of the Third Primary School and the vicinity of the Binxing Hall, hoping to shoot water directly, but it was not very effective. The fire burned until about 10 o'clock, and the embers were still not extinguished. Even the Third Primary School was almost set ablaze. It is estimated that the fire started in the east one li of Linjiang Street, and burned down two-thirds of the entire street along Linjiang Street. The tail of the fire reached the Xuantan Temple Pier (i.e., the New Pier) in the south, and the Puqing Theater in the west. Qisheng Street, south one li, was also completely burned down. The fire stopped at the intersection of Qisheng Street and Mingde Street in the north. A total of more than a hundred houses were burned down. After 11 o'clock, Police Chief Zhou of the Public Security Bureau, believing that although the fire had been extinguished, the embers had not been extinguished and he was very concerned that the fire would reignite with the wind, causing further disaster, repeatedly ordered the fire brigade and the engineering team, as well as off-duty police officers and water carriers from the sub-stations, to go and extinguish the remaining fire. It was not until about 12 o'clock that the remaining fire was completely extinguished.</p>
<p>The streets and houses destroyed in this fire are as follows: odd-numbered addresses on Linjiang Street from No. 73 to No. 93, and even-numbered addresses from No. 94 to No. 120. These twenty-five houses had their tiles removed to prevent the spread of the fire. Their furniture and miscellaneous items were not greatly damaged. The total number of houses burned down was 58, with odd-numbered addresses on Linjiang Street from No. 95 to No. 157, and even-numbered addresses from No. 122 to No. 172. On Qisheng Street, south one li, all 42 houses from No. 1 to No. 48 were burned down, except for houses with the numbers 24, 26, 29, 23, 27, 35, and 36. In addition, all 24 houses from No. 1 to No. 24 in Lane 1 of Qisheng Street, south one li, were burned down. Furthermore, 32 houses with odd-numbered addresses on Qisheng Street from No. 33-4 to No. 69, and even-numbered addresses from No. 18 to No. 42, were burned down. On Linjiang Street, east one li, 32 houses from No. 10 to No. 36, and No. 7 to No. 43, were burned down. On the back street of Linjiang Street, east one li, only Li Lin's house at No. 15 was not burned. The remaining 32 houses from No. 6-1 to No. 14 were all destroyed. It is estimated that a total of 188 houses were burned down, 25 houses were demolished, affecting 475 households and 1,737 men and women, with property losses valued at over 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Theft Case in Xiamen; Stolen Diamonds and Jewelry Worth Over 42,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen: Xue Gongran (also known as Yun Da), a resident of No. 53 Ding'an Road in Xiamen, had diamonds and gold jewelry worth 42,570 yuan stolen at around 3:00 AM on the 23rd, marking an unprecedented major case in Xiamen. Xue Gongran is the son of Xue Yushui, a wealthy businessman from Xueling Village, Waishan, Xiamen City. He studied in the United States and majored in the army. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Waishan Civil Aviation Office. He is currently a director of the Gulangyu Electric Company. His family is wealthy. Two years ago, he married Zheng Ai'ying, whose family is also wealthy. Her dowry jewelry was worth over 20,000 yuan. Xue inherited jewelry worth over 20,000 from his estate. Xue feared bandits in the countryside, so he moved to the city to live on Huyuan Road. Because it was secluded, he moved again to his wife's family on Ding'an Road. On the night of the 22nd, Xue stayed on Gulangyu and did not return. His wife was afraid to sleep alone, so she took her child to sleep in the opposite room with the wet nurse. Her jewelry was placed in a small iron cabinet, which was then placed in a leather suitcase on the mezzanine of her bedroom. No one was in the room that night, so a thief sneaked in, opened the suitcase, broke the iron cabinet, and stole all the jewelry. The steel clamp that held the iron cabinet was taken from a drawer in the room. It was not until 8:00 AM that people woke up and discovered the theft. Xue's wife telegraphed Xue to return and reported the case to the police for investigation. The thief entered the courtyard by climbing over the wall. A window in the bedroom had not been locked that night, so the thief entered through it. Shen Jinkang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally went to investigate and questioned Xue and his wife separately. Two fingerprints were found on the glass window, and a footprint was found on the mattress. All were taken for research. The husband of the wet nurse and two plasterers who had repaired Xue's house were detained as suspects and are being interrogated. Xue presented a list of stolen items as follows: (1) Five pairs of diamond earrings, worth 15,000 yuan; (2) Three diamond rings, worth 15,000 yuan; (3) A pearl necklace that can be wrapped around the neck twice, worth 1,500 yuan; (4) American gold shields, worth 5,000 yuan; (5) Two pearl rings, worth 40 yuan; (6) A pair of gold diamond bracelets, worth 500 yuan; (7) A pair of pearl bracelets, worth 100 yuan; (8) A pair of jade diamond bracelets, worth 300 yuan; (9) A gold watch with a chain, worth 100 yuan; (10) A pair of gold-inlaid diamond and jade butterfly brooches, worth 500 yuan; (11) A pair of pearl-headed black stone earrings, worth 30 yuan; (12) A pair of four-pearl bracelets, worth 300 yuan; (13) A gold-inlaid diamond ring, worth 200 yuan; (14) A pair of gold-inlaid diamond and jade earrings, worth 500 yuan; (15) A diamond chest brooch, worth 3,000 yuan; (16) A pair of pearl flowers, worth 300 yuan; (17) A gold-inlaid diamond pearl ring, worth 200 yuan. The total value is 42,570 yuan. Among them, except for the American gold shields worth 5,000 yuan, the rest are all jewelry. (November 25th)</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Survey of Schoolchildren Throughout the County</h3>
<p>This county plans to eliminate illiteracy. In addition to holding 168 literacy classes, it has recently decided to survey the number of school-age children throughout the county to facilitate the implementation of compulsory education.

<h3>Suzhou: Landlords Send Personnel to Form Public Warehouses</h3>
<p>The landlord warehouses in Suzhou are facing difficulties. Since the opening of the warehouses, half a month has passed, but less than 10% of the land rent has been collected. The situation is particularly serious in Chefang, Xietang, Xiangcheng, and other villages that resisted rent last year. To facilitate farmers paying their rent nearby, the warehouses have jointly established a joint rent collection public warehouse in Chefang and other villages. Personnel were dispatched to the villages on the 26th to prepare for its establishment as soon as possible. The county government is also rigorously pursuing the rent collection issue and expects to complete the rent collection. Overdue rents will be subject to pressure, and Jiang Yunjie and others have been dispatched to the villages to guide the work.</p>
<h3>Strict Winter Defense by Various Agencies</h3>
<p>Military and police agencies in Suzhou are concerned about the recent rampant thefts in urban and rural areas. In order to maintain local security, they have jointly organized the Wuxian Winter Defense Committee, with the military commander Song as the director and the water and land public security agencies, the county government, and the county party department as members. Ten local people have also been invited as honorary members. Winter defense will begin on December 1st. At that time, military and police agencies will jointly form a military and police joint defense patrol team to patrol various places. The director of the Public Security Bureau also convened a security meeting on the morning of the 26th, gathering the heads of various branches and teams to decide to pay close attention to various train stations and ports to prevent bandits from mixing in, and to strictly check various hotels and ships to avoid harboring bandits.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Xiangmen Opening Project</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the Sujia Railway, the Suzhou Construction Department has opened Xiangmen in the Lion Gate area to facilitate passengers, and built two bridges inside and outside the city. The opening project has been underway for three months and has been completed. The Construction Department specially sent personnel yesterday to inspect and accept the project together with personnel from the Wuxian Construction Bureau. They were satisfied. It will be open to traffic from the next month, and an opening ceremony will be held. After Xiangmen is opened and closed, passengers in the city can go to the Sujia Railway Xiangmen Station and enter and exit directly from Xiangmen without having to go around. As for the expenses for requisitioning private land that the Railway Bureau should issue, they have been approved by the Ministry of Railways and will be distributed to households in the coming month.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: One Day's Contribution to the Country</h3>
<p>Since the Advocacy Committee and the County Chamber of Commerce advocated contributing one day's worth to the country in this county, donations from all walks of life have been enthusiastic. The first week's results showed that the advocacy committee had received a total of 403 yuan in one-day contributions from various banks. To enable the public to understand the amount of donations, the association has been reporting the names of donors and the amount of donations on the radio every day since the 26th. The Entertainment Review Committee has also instructed various theaters and book venues to schedule dates to contribute all of their one-day operating income to the country. More than 30 silk and cloth stores jointly donated 1,234 yuan of national currency. The Xicheng Company and all employees donated more than 200 yuan. The General Labor Union scheduled a meeting today to convene workers from various factories to determine a one-day donation method. The department store industry decided that member stores will contribute all or a portion of their one-day profit or income to the country.</p>
<h3>Rise in Xis Sha Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The market price of cotton yarn in this county has been booming recently due to strong sales in various places. In addition, the Shanghai standard for this month has been delivered. The market situation has created a shortage, and the current sales of various gangs have been extremely active, causing the yarn price for this month to jump by 15 yuan. People are even more firm in their belief that the market price is steadily increasing. Yesterday, the price of various brands of cotton yarn in this county rose by 2 yuan. At the same time, cotton has become more difficult to obtain. The yarn and flower for this month have been completely delivered, and the people's belief has weakened and the market price has declined.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Continued Inquiry into the Jiaotong Bank Mega-Theft Case</h3>
<p>It is heard that the mega-theft case at the Jiaotong Bank on Daonan Street has yielded clues after three days of investigation. However, the bank authorities refuse to disclose the amount of the loss. The Public Security Bureau is also keeping it secret. After the case occurred, all employees were placed under surveillance. The two suspects, the cook Yan Genfu and Li San, were arrested and detained. The president of the bank, Zhang Gu Ru, was far away in Qingdao and could not return in time, so he directly reported to the Shanghai head office, which sent personnel to Changshu to handle the matter. Currently, the Public Security Bureau is interrogating Yan Genfu in custody. According to Yan's confession, he stole a small leather suitcase from the iron box, which contained 2,000 yuan in banknotes and many stock documents. The most valuable items were a large number of gold and pearl jewelry. As for the small purse, after taking the hidden items, it was thrown on the open space on the right wall of the bank. It is said to have been picked up by the foreman Ding Guifang. After obtaining the confession, the investigators went to Ding's residence to search and found the small purse. However, according to Ding Guifang's claim, the small purse was picked up by the stone-picking workers Sun Amei, Lu Xiaomao, Sun Jinwu, etc., on the open space south of the Jiaotong Bank. At the time, they suspected it was a schoolbag left behind by a primary school student, so they handed it over to him (Ding claimed). It is now stored in his home, and there are no remaining items in the box. Because each of these people is suspected, the Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to arrest them separately. The Jiaotong Bank's petition police, tea servant Wang Genxiang and his wife, Zou Bingsheng, etc., were also arrested at the same time, and are currently being held temporarily.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Arrest of Suspicious Monks and Taoists</h3>
<p>Taoist Li Tongming was seen wandering along Qiao Street in the city yesterday. The patrol officer there spotted him and, suspecting his behavior, went forward to question him. According to his vague answers, eight 10-yuan banknotes from Shandong Province were found on his person. After a brief interrogation by Inspector Guo, he was escorted to the county government for legal processing. In addition, the 9th sub-station of the Fangxianqiao Public Security Bureau also arrested a suspicious monk, Yongyun, near Baozhuang Bridge yesterday. He was escorted to the city and handed over to the general bureau for questioning by the county.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Results of the Seawall Bidding Announced</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office previously invited bids for the construction of stone, wood, and piling stone materials for the seawalls in Songjiang, Taicang, Baoshan, and Changshu counties. The bids were publicly opened at 2:00 PM on November 11 in the auditorium of the Construction Department. The office announced yesterday that, after a joint review, it was determined that Kong Shenji was the successful bidder for the first stone material package, and Gong Yu Xing was the successful bidder for the second and third packages. For the piling and stone masonry project, Shunji Civil Engineering Company was the successful bidder for the second package, Zhaodetai Construction Factory was the successful bidder for the third package, and Jianxing Construction Company was the successful bidder for the fourth package. The successful bidders should come to the office immediately to sign the contract in accordance with the regulations. The remaining bidders should come to the office immediately with the receipt to collect the original bid deposit to complete the procedure.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: General Mobilization for Tax Collection Begins</h3>
<p>In order to encourage the implementation of annual tax clearance and because the collection period for the first installment of the 25th year's land tax is about to expire, the county government has specially decided to start a general mobilization to complete the annual land tax collection on the 26th. Finance Section staff Zhang Linsi and Zhang Lian were appointed to supervise the collection at the urban collection sub-office, Li Mingliang was appointed to supervise the collection at the Xin Cheng sub-office, Xu Bolou was appointed to supervise the collection at the Wangjiangjing sub-office, and Xu Zhaoxing was appointed to supervise the collection at the Wangdian sub-office. The number of assessors and tax collection police officers was also increased at each sub-office. In the urban area, Weng Zuquan was appointed as the urban land tax inspector to supervise the land registry staff in the villages to complete the situation. The joint offices in each district also convened a joint meeting of the heads of various townships and towns to provide information. The county government also sent personnel to attend and provide instructions. All land registry staff have also been dispatched to the villages to pursue collection, so that each taxpayer can pay as soon as possible and avoid being summoned for collection.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Emergency Reinforcement of the Hangping Causeway Begins</h3>
<p>The Hangping section of the Zhejiang West Hangping Causeway has not been repaired for a long time, and there are crises on all sides. Recently, the outer layers of the Shitou Causeway in the Wuding and Shuo Gan number sections have collapsed, and the bottom of the causeway is hollow, presenting a dangerous situation. After receiving the report, the Construction Department sent personnel to inspect the results. The department then requested funds from the provincial government for repairs. Currently, 10,000 yuan has been received, and workers have been hired to begin emergency rescue work, as well as the demolition and construction of stone causeways and the repair of Tan Shui projects. A deadline has been set for the completion of the construction to ensure defense.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Comfort and Relief Association for the Suppression of Bandits in Suiyuan and the Association for the Advancement of Relief Work, specially dispatched a delegation of representatives to Suiyuan consisting of Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, Lu Jingshi, Luo Youxuan, and Mr. Wang's son. The delegation flew north on the 23rd. Except for Mr. Luo, who remained in Suiyuan to provide timely news, Wang, Lin, Huang, Yan, Pang, Lu, and the others, took the original plane and, after stopping in Luoyang, returned to Shanghai at 4:45 PM yesterday, landing at Hongqiao Airport. According to a representative who spoke to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, our journey took us from Shanghai on the 23rd, arriving in Xi'an that day, where we stayed overnight. The next day, we flew to Taiyuan, also staying overnight. On the third day, we flew to Suiyuan, returning to Bing that day, for a total of four days, and today we returned to Shanghai. I can happily report to the nation that the soldiers at the front are bravely fighting with high morale. The Central Army has also arrived at the front and completed its deployment. Chairman Chuanyi and all his subordinates are excited and determined to go all out. Since the recapture of Bailingmiao, there has been no trace of bandits in Suiyuan Province. Although the bandit puppet army still intends to regroup, it has been severely damaged in the Bailingmiao battle. The national army's defensive works are solid, making it difficult for them to take advantage. We met with Secretary Duan (Maolan), dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate, and learned that there is concrete evidence of a certain party assisting the bandits, which will be kept as evidence for future negotiations. Currently, we only know that suppressing the bandits is the task at hand. Mr. Wang and others have also scheduled to issue a joint written statement today, detailing everything. The Military Affairs Commission's reply telegram, Finance Minister Kong's congratulatory telegram, and the enthusiastic situation of donations from all parties are summarized as follows:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, which stated: "Chairman Wang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Du of the Local Association, greetings.

You, Military Affairs Commission."</p>
<p>Kong's Telegram of Congratulations</p>
<p>Chuan Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province, defended national survival and led the army to recapture Bailingmiao.

He originally intended to go to Japan to return to his post after attending Mr. Duan's memorial service next month, but now he needs to convey the results of his visit with Minister Zhang to Ambassador Xu, so he decided to take the Changxing Company's Russian Queen today to return to his post.</p>
<h3>British Tram Company: Dismissal Dispute Resolved; Zhu Huiren Allowed to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that Zhu Huiren, ticket seller No. 330 of the British Shanghai Tram Company, was falsely accused of bribery by ticket inspector No. 127. The company dismissed him from his job. The ticket seller was wrongly accused and unable to make a living, so he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Suzhou River. Fortunately, he was rescued. After this incident, all 450 ticket sellers sent a joint letter to the company in a show of support, requesting that the employee be reinstated. However, the company did not accept it, causing outrage. The case was later handled by representatives of the ticket sellers, Ma Zijun, who negotiated with Plock, the General Superintendent of the company, and asked the company to consider the workers' difficulties and allow them to resume work. Mr. Plock accepted, but Zhu Huiren was temporarily transferred to the Yangshupu Station to dispatch trains. The union was satisfied and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3>Russian Consul in Shanghai Goes to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in China and Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Spivinak, returned to Shanghai after his last visit to Nanjing. He stayed in Shanghai for two days and then went to Nanjing yesterday. According to Saratov Tchiff, a spokesman for the Soviet Embassy in Shanghai, Mr. Spivinak has no special mission in going back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai.

<h3>Hino Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Meets with Sato and Others to Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>Hino Masaharu, commander of the Japanese 11th Fleet in China, recently went to Nanjing to visit Ambassador Kawagoe, Military Attaché Amamiya, and others to inquire about the recent situation of Sino-Japanese negotiations and discuss future policies.

<h3>Shallow Water in the Yangtze River Obstructs Navigation and Stops; New Waterway Found in the Xun-Han Section; Water Depth is Ten Feet Three Inches; River Boats Can Pass Up and Down; Freight Transportation Between Shanghai and Hankou is Unobstructed</h3>
<p>The water level in the Yangtze River this year is the lowest in 35 years. Yesterday, it was reported that the Jiujiang-Hankou section was only 9 feet 1 inch deep. The Shanghai companies' river boats to Hankou, loaded with cargo and passengers, were stopped by the shallow water as soon as they reached Jiujiang and could not sail upstream. Many Taikoo and Jardine river boats have been stranded. The Sanbei Company's Xinpu ship could not sail upstream after arriving in Jiujiang on the 25th. In addition to transferring the cargo to Hankou by barge, some passengers refunded their tickets and some went to Jiujiang to transfer to shallow water boats to Hankou. The Xinpu ship could only terminate its trip to Hankou and returned to Shanghai from Xun. The Changxing ship did not go to Hankou this time and is now returning to Shanghai from Jiujiang and needs to be repaired. At this time when the upstream water is shallow and the waterway is cut off, the six companies are deeply worried that the goods in the Xun-Han section cannot reach the upper reaches. Just as they were anxious, the wheel companies received telegrams from Hankou and Jiujiang yesterday afternoon, stating that a new waterway has been found between Xun and Han today (26th). The Jianghan Water Scale measured ten feet and three inches, one foot and two inches deeper than the original waterway. Yangtze River boats can pass back and forth under the limited water scale. A new waterway has been found between Jiujiang and Hankou. The Shanghai wheel companies were overjoyed and immediately notified the upstream boats to change to the new waterway, which can go directly to Hankou.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Plans Uniform Donation Collection Method in the City; Passed by the Executive Committee Yesterday; Will Be Implemented After Consultation with the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that after the start of the bandit suppression war in Suiyuan, the citizens of the city were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and generously donated. However, due to the lack of unified organization, not only the citizens do not know what to do, but also the distribution is difficult to be uniform. In order to prevent abuses, it is necessary to unify the collection. At the same time, according to the One-Day Movement Promotion Committee, the organization suggested to organize a National Defense Donation Collection Unified Committee to avoid divergence. The headquarters has drafted a unified method, which has been submitted to the Executive Committee for approval yesterday. Tong Xingbai, the Standing Committee member of the headquarters, said that after consultation with the municipal government, a committee can be convened from various agencies and groups to implement it on schedule.</p>
<h3>Yingkou, Andong, and Other Places Telegraph That They Will Be Frozen; Shanghai-Yingkou Money Wheel Ships Will Be Discontinued</h3>
<p>The Zhaoxing, Datongxing, Haichang, and Zhengji steamship companies operating the Shanghai-Yingkou-Andong route have received telegrams from Yingkou and Andong stating that the weather in those two places has turned cold and will begin to freeze. It is expected that the ports will be closed in two weeks. Therefore, the various gangs in Shanghai, Dongsansheng, are purchasing large quantities of goods and loading them onto ships for urgent transportation, because after the ports are closed, transportation will inevitably be changed to land, and the fare will be higher than by water.</p>
<h3>After the Resolution of the Shanghai West Japanese Cotton Mill Labor Strike, Another Strike Erupts at the Pudong Japanese-Chinese Mill. Party and Government Officials Dispatch Representatives to Mediate, and the Situation Has Eased. A Solution is Expected This Morning after Consultation, and Work Will Resume Immediately – Continued Negotiations for Remaining Cases in Western District Factories</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the labor strike at the Japanese cotton mills in western Shanghai has been resolved after mediation by party and government agencies and Mr. Du Yuesheng. The employers accepted seven conditions. The Toyota factories resumed full operations yesterday morning. The Japanese-Chinese Mill will resume night shifts due to scheduled holidays. Except for one or two factories, the rest of the factories inside and outside the city have resumed work. However, at the Japanese-Chinese cotton mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, all workers went on strike again at around 11 o'clock the night before last. After the Social Affairs Bureau sent representatives to mediate, the situation has eased, and it is scheduled to resume the night shift tonight. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Toyota Factories - Full Resumption of Work</p>
<p>More than 5,500 workers, male and female, from the Toyota No. 1 and No. 2 factories on Zhongshan Road, all reported back to work at 6 o'clock yesterday morning, with the A shift (i.e., the day shift) consisting of more than 2,200 workers. The order was very good. All the police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the concession police who had been dispatched to guard the factories were withdrawn after the workers returned to work. Japanese Marines are still stationed inside the factory as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese-Chinese Mill in Western Shanghai - Work Resumed Last Night</p>
<p>Workers at the Japanese-Chinese No. 3 and No. 4 factories on Lubosheng Road were originally scheduled to resume work yesterday morning, but because it happened to be the factory's ninth day of rest, the day shift did not start. The night shift started instead. All workers of the B shift reported to work at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The Lubosheng Road Public Security Bureau in charge of the area also dispatched more than 40 police officers to maintain order outside the factory gate, and the order was good.</p>
<p>Factories Inside and Outside the City - Workers Hold Meeting</p>
<p>Except for the No. 1 and No. 2 factories, where only one-third of the workers reported for both day and night shifts yesterday, the number of workers who resumed work at the No. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 factories has exceeded two-thirds. The workers who have not yet resumed work held a meeting at Jin Situ Temple on Kang Nai Road at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. Representatives from each factory reported on the conditions negotiated by Mr. Du, party and government agencies, and the employers. After discussion, it was decided that all workers would report to work during the early shift today.</p>
<p>Factories Announce - Acknowledgment of Conditions</p>
<p>At 5:30 this morning, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency drove to various factories in the western district of Shanghai to inspect the situation. At the gates of each Japanese cotton mill and inside the factories, announcements acknowledging the conditions were posted. Workers gathered to watch, shoulder to shoulder. On the spot, workers' representatives also reported the details of each clause to the worker masses.</p>
<p>Other Outstanding Cases - Continued Negotiations</p>
<p>Workers who were deemed by the factory to be suspected of inciting the labor strike or who were arrested by the police during the strike period have decided to postpone the resumption of work. They are still requesting Mr. Du and party and government agencies to bail out the arrested workers and reinstate them. Mr. Du has accepted the workers' request and agreed to negotiate with all parties to resolve the issue, so that workers will not lose their jobs or suffer punishment.</p>
<p>Another Strike Erupts at the Pudong Japanese-Chinese Mill</p>
<p>The Japanese-Chinese No. 1 and No. 2 cotton mills in Lujiazui, Pudong, employ more than 3,200 workers. Recently, due to the conditions demanded by the Japanese cotton mills in western Shanghai, a resolution has been reached. However, the employers of this factory have not improved the treatment of workers, so the public is dissatisfied. At about 11 o'clock the night before last, when a female worker named Shen A'jin was working in the factory, the foreman of the cloth weaving room, a Japanese named Jiro Maru, entered and accused Shen A'jin of deliberately neglecting her duties. Without asking for any reason, he used a wooden stick to beat and insult Shen, which aroused public outrage among the night shift workers. They stood up to negotiate, but to no avail. Therefore, they jointly went on strike, demanding that the factory severely punish the violent staff member to appease public anger.</p>
<p>Workers Propose - Treatment Conditions</p>
<p>The factory workers have put forward eleven demands for improved treatment: (1) One hour for meals and breaks in each room; (2) Add a stool for every four looms in the weaving room; (3) Two days of pay for uninterrupted work each month; (4) Increase wages by 20% for those who make more than 75 spools in the spinning room; (5) Daily wages for workers should be increased by 20 cents per day; (6) Wages should be paid on the 15th and 30th of each month; (7) Workers should not be hindered when asking for leave due to inability to work; (8) Night shift on Saturdays should be completed by 6 a.m., and additional wages should be paid for working beyond that time; (9) Workers should not be dismissed without reason; (10) The trade union should be recognized as having the right to represent all workers; (11) Dismiss the foreman of the cloth weaving room, Japanese Jiro Maru.</p>
<p>Japanese Injured - Falsely Accused of Assault</p>
<p>After the foreman of the cloth weaving room, a Japanese named Jiro Maru, beat and insulted the female worker Shen A'jin with a stick in the factory, it aroused public outrage among all workers and caused a labor strike. Seeing this, the Japanese ran out of the cloth weaving room. Because he was very panicked, he accidentally hit the wall when leaving the door of the cloth weaving room, and his head was injured. The Japanese then reported to the factory, falsely accusing the workers of assaulting him. The factory immediately notified Zhang Mingqin, the director of the Pudong Branch of the Public Security Bureau, to negotiate and request protection, otherwise they would take self-defense actions. After receiving the report, Director Zhang drove to investigate and determined that the Japanese was injured by accidentally hitting the wall. He has reported the situation and dispatched a large number of police officers to protect the factory to avoid causing disturbances.</p>
<p>Party and Government Officials - Joint Mediation</p>
<p>After the labor strike occurred in the two factories, the Municipal Party Department sent Zhang Sheng, the executive director of the People's Movement Section, to investigate the truth in the morning. The Social Affairs Bureau also sent Zhang Chuqiang, a mediator from the Third Section, and Zhang Mingqin, the director of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, to the factory at about 2 p.m. to consult with the foreman Chai Qi, but the factory insisted on dismissing 20 worker representatives, which led to the failure of the mediation. After another four hours of consultation, as a result, the factory only punished the worker representatives Wei Shunqing and Zhang Songfang, and did not dismiss all workers. At about 6 p.m., representatives of the Party and Government summoned the factory's worker representatives to the Pudong Public Security Bureau for discussion, explained the situation, and persuaded them to resume work immediately.</p>
<p>Conditions Required - Consultation This Morning</p>
<p>The workers put forward eleven demands for improved treatment. Due to time constraints yesterday, there was no time for mediation. The representatives of the Party and Government scheduled with the factory foreman Chai Qi for another consultation at 10 a.m. this morning. However, it is still difficult to predict whether a satisfactory result can be achieved. It is also understood that all the workers in the factory did not report to work last night, and will not report to work this morning either. They will resume work in the factory tonight after the conditions are resolved.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Repays the Loan to the Hankou Paper Mill - Principal and Interest to Be Repaid in Eight Years in Installments - Notice of Loss of Mortgage Deed</h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that the old Ministry of Finance borrowed a sum of money from the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company in the 14th year of the Republic of China for the Hankou Paper Mill. The repayment of the loan has now been approved by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on the 24th of this month, with the principal and interest to be repaid in installments. Regarding the mortgage deed and list of assets previously mortgaged to the company, it is impossible to find them for the time being. Both parties have issued a joint notice declaring them invalid. If any disputes arise, the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company will be responsible. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Notice from Both Parties</p>
<p>Case investigation: The Ministry of Finance's Hankou Paper Mill and the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company signed a loan contract in October of the 14th year of the Republic of China. Article 4 stated that the Hankou Paper Mill would submit the asset list, deed, and vouchers, etc., guaranteeing the loan to the company. Now, due to the reorganization of the debt of this case, the company needs to return the aforementioned documents. After investigation, it has been found that the documents were never received at that time, and a statement has been made to the Ministry of Finance to exempt them from being submitted. The Ministry of Finance has ordered an investigation of the Hankou Paper Mill and found that it does not have the aforementioned documents either. The company should still be responsible for investigating and returning them. The company has applied to the Ministry of Finance to first jointly publish a notice stating that all asset lists, deeds, vouchers, etc., that the Hankou Paper Mill should have submitted to the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, if they fall into the hands of any Chinese or foreign person, will be invalid. If there are any disputes, the company will be responsible for resolving them. After verification by the Ministry of Finance, the matter is feasible. Permission has been granted to jointly publish a notice. In addition to continuing the thorough investigation, this notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Debt Reorganization</p>
<p>The Hankou Paper Mill borrowed 750,000 yuan from the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company in the 8th year of the Republic of China, mortgaging the company's assets at the time. When the Ministry of Finance reorganized domestic and foreign debts, it was classified as an unsecured foreign debt. As of June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, according to the Finance Yearbook, the principal and interest owed was 2,760,091.84 Japanese yen. Now, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, in order to reorganize foreign debts, has discussed the repayment method with the company.</p>
<p>Principal and Interest</p>
<p>The initial debt amount was only 750,000 yuan, but the accumulated principal and interest has reached the aforementioned huge amount. Our country has a very large debt burden, and it is difficult to fully commit to it. Therefore, the representative of the company, Eto Yutaka, was summoned to negotiate. As a result, it was agreed to repay the principal and interest.</p>
<p>Eight Years to Repay</p>
<p>It has recently been decided that the debt will be repaid within eight years after signing the agreement, with 15,000 yuan repaid monthly and 180,000 yuan repaid annually. The day of full repayment will be the day the interest is terminated.</p>

<h3>American Micron Oil Company Accused of Illegally Building Oil Tanks, Donggou Residents Consider it Dangerous, Petitioning the Court to Order Demolition</h3>
<p>Donggou residents Dai Chengzhang, Chen Haoyan, et al. in Pudong, hired lawyer Xu Lin and filed a lawsuit with the Customs Tax Department and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau against the American Micron Oil Company, organized by Wang Yongchang and Zhang Rulin of the Zhonghui Building, for illegally building oil tanks and secretly importing oil. They requested an order for demolition to avoid danger, stating that the Shanghai Regulations for the Management of Oil Tanks stipulated that oil tanks were not allowed to be set up within designated areas. Therefore, Mobil, Asiatic, etc. were ordered to relocate earlier and designated Gaoqiao Laoshu Sha as the oil tank area. Now, Wang Yongchang et al. plan to secretly build oil tanks at the Huaxing Wharf in this town and have publicly announced this in newspapers. In recent days, workers have been seen busily working. It has been learned that the warehouses have already built two large and small oil tanks, and it is rumored that oil has already been shipped from the United States and will arrive in Shanghai soon, which is truly alarming. The entire town of Donggou is in great danger. Legitimate businessmen dare not invest, land prices will fall, and the market will not prosper. For their own selfish interests, they are endangering the entire town and harming others for their own benefit. They requested assistance in stopping this, ordering the demolition, and prohibiting oil tankers from importing and docking to avoid public outrage from the townspeople, etc. After receiving the report, the Customs Tax Department and the Public Security Bureau are now reviewing and investigating.</p>
<h3>Pimping Female Guide for Ring, Perpetrator Arrested, Committed More Than One Offense, Held for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiuying, a female employee from Huzhou at the Sanle Dance Hall No. 8 at No. 18, Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, was summoned by a Mr. Zhang at around 1:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month to Room 27 of the Cade Hotel at No. 8, Lane 143, Cade Road. Mr. Zhang initially proposed to have Zhang stay with him, but she firmly refused and was unable to achieve his goal. He then saw that Zhang was wearing a gold ring on her hand and took the ring away on the pretext of borrowing it for viewing. Later, he made an excuse to go shopping and never returned. Zhang reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate and identified the tea boy of the hotel, Tu Yongchen, as an accomplice. He was arrested, and a gemstone gold ring was found on his person. Zhang recognized that the ring belonged to Song Lijun, a female employee from Ningbo at the same dance hall. She had also been tricked into giving it to Mr. Zhang in the same way on the 13th. Wang Yongchen was sent to the First Special District Court and sentenced to 30 days of detention. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail. Meanwhile, the court issued a warrant for Mr. Zhang. Until 12:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, Wang Yongchen suddenly encountered Mr. Zhang at the intersection of Avenue Road on Avenue Edward VII and immediately called Chinese Officer No. 2778 to arrest him and bring him to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese Detective Xu Zhiqin learned that his name was Zhang [Character Missing]rong, from Ningbo, 21 years old. He had previously been sentenced to one year and six months in prison for fraud, but the sentence was changed to a fine of 200 yuan on appeal. Zhang confessed to tricking the two female guides, Zhang and Song, out of their gold rings. Zhang's ring had been sold to the Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop on Nanjing Road for 16 yuan and 50 fen. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation and said that a female employee from the Tianyi Guide Agency had also reported to the police that she had been tricked out of her ring by the defendant. Now that the agency has been closed, the plaintiff cannot be found. However, this shows that the defendant is engaged in this as a profession, and it is inevitable that he has committed similar incidents. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed to facilitate investigation into whether he has committed other offenses. Subsequently, Zhang and Song filed complaints about their experiences of being tricked. After interrogating Zhang Zirong, Judge Ye Shengchao ordered that the case be adjourned for one week for further hearing.</p>
<h3>County Government Investigates and Bans Female Witch Doctors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an official letter from the County Party Department stating that the 578th District Branch reported that during the current autumn harvest, diseases are prevalent. Ignorant villagers often consult female witch doctors, saying that their fate is bad or that ghosts and gods are causing trouble. They then order rituals to be performed for the sick to exorcise evil spirits. As a result, they not only waste money but also delay treatment, which is extremely harmful. Such bad habits should be eradicated as soon as possible. Therefore, they jointly submitted a report to the County Party Committee to forward it to the County Government for strict prohibition. County Magistrate Li yesterday ordered the Public Security Bureau to instruct its subordinates to investigate and ban female witch doctors from deceiving villagers for money and not to tolerate them in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Xia Hesheng's Adultery Case Settled Out of Court</h3>
<p>Xia Hesheng, a famous storyteller from Jiashan, Zhejiang, is 38 years old. His wife, Zhang (named Guoying), has been married for 15 years and resides at No. 5, Cishou Lane, Sapore Road, French Concession, but they have not had any children. This summer, Xia had an affair with a local woman, Chen Shuzhen (22 years old), and rented No. 3, Hongyi Lane, Pupai Road (Datiebang), as a place to keep her in a golden house. Recently, his wife, Zhang, found out and reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to the golden house at dawn on the 18th of this month and arrested Xia and Chen. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court, where the Police Affairs Department lawyer filed a lawsuit for adultery in violation of family under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them and ordered the defendants to be released on bail to await a further hearing. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another hearing was scheduled, but the defendants did not appear after being released on bail. Only the plaintiff, Xia's wife, Zhang, and her lawyer, Sun Zuji, appeared in court and stated that the case had been settled out of court through mediation and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit. After reviewing the statement, the court granted the request and ruled that the case would not be accepted. A scandalous affair thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Bao Gang Case Scheduled for Further Hearing Tomorrow, Court Suspends Visits Due to Concerns of Collusion</h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang was accused by Cui Changgui, bodyguard of Liu Huaisan, captain of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Detective Team, of seducing his fiancée, Yang Yuehua, and hiding her at the home of Zhang [character missing]hong, chief of the third district of Chuansha. He was also accused of tea boy Zhang Xinkui being the instigator. After the prosecutor of the local court filed a public prosecution, Bao's wife accused former Detective Team Captain Zhang Datong of abusing his power and making an illegal arrest. The Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to investigate. The court ordered Bao to pay an additional 3,000 yuan in surety and Zhang Xinkui to pay 1,000 yuan in surety. Zhang was detained without surety. Bao was released on bail by Huang Shunxing Wood Shop. Later, Bao evaded the hearing, and the surety applied to the court to withdraw the bail. With the assistance of the police station, Bao was arrested and detained in court. After Judge Wang Shanxiang conducted a new hearing, Bao Gang requested to be released from detention. The judge ruled that he pay 5,000 yuan in surety. Bao found Yang Renxing Wood Shop on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, and Dafeng South Goods Shop in Xieqiao as guarantors. However, because the judge wanted to review whether the two shops had the financial capacity to provide surety, he often ordered them to submit their share certificates or capital books and business books for review. Both shops failed to meet the amount of surety, so he was still detained. The court has now scheduled a further hearing for the 30th of this month. Because Bao Gang and Zhang Xinkui have both presented new counter-evidence, the judge is concerned that there may be collusion. Before the trial, he specifically ordered the prison to suspend visits to both Bao and Zhang.</p>
<h3>Journalists' Association Forgives Xiang Kangyuan, Two Letters Expressing Misunderstanding and Apology, Expressing Candor, Association Will Not Investigate Further</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiping and Ding Ding, members of the Shanghai Journalists' Association, previously alleged that Xiang Kangyuan, manager of Kangyuan Can Factory, made public insults to all journalists in court in a case accusing Gu Qiushui, a former engineer of the factory. The two members, Zhang and Ding, proposed, and three members, Ma Chonggan, Guan Jiu'an, and Zhu Chaoran, seconded, and submitted it to the joint meeting of the fourth session of the association's executive and supervisory committees on the 13th of this month, requesting that negotiations be carried out. It was resolved that the association should send a letter to Xiang Kangyuan seriously questioning him, as reported in the previous newspaper. Subsequently, Xiang Kangyuan sent two letters stating the facts and circumstances of the court hearing and expressing that China's industry is backward and that he is extremely grateful for the support and promotion of the association's members. He has always admired their enthusiastic advocacy and would never want to slander them in this way. He sincerely apologized for the misunderstanding and attached a transcript of the court hearing to the letter to clarify the truth. The association held the sixth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association headquarters at 5:00 p.m. on the 25th and put it forward for discussion. After careful study by the committee members, it was generally agreed that Xiang Kangyuan's wording in the court statement was somewhat inappropriate. However, the news media has been enthusiastically promoting domestic products for many years, and the relationship with the domestic product industry is extremely harmonious. Since he has stated this in his letter and to show the candor of the news media, it was unanimously resolved not to investigate further, and the meeting ended.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Retrenchment Committee: Recommendation for Universal Salary Reduction, Board of Directors Approves Full Report</h3>
<p>Following several meetings spanning months, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession's Retrenchment Committee, organized to discuss internal administrative reduction measures, has completed its report, which has been submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The contents of the report are detailed below. The original report is lengthy, comprising over twenty articles. The first section outlines the committee's purpose: to assess the Public Works Bureau's current financial situation and determine how to implement internal retrenchment without unfairly treating personnel or impacting operational effectiveness. It states that current service regulations must be considered due to salary reductions. Compensation beyond salary is also an essential part of public servants' remuneration and difficult to consider separately. The current 'A' and 'L' grades should be changed to three grades: 'A,' 'B,' etc.</p>
<p>Salaries</p>
<p>The committee believes that the relative salaries of various positions within the bureau are beyond the scope of its discussion and cannot be revised. However, promotions appear to have been too rapid for middle-level personnel in certain areas, which should be addressed in the future. The salary levels of senior personnel, compared to equivalent positions within or outside the bureau or in the business sector, are not considered excessive. However, considering overall compensation, a general salary reduction is feasible, and a reduction limit of eight percent is proposed.</p>
<p>Newly Established Salary Grades</p>
<p>Currently, the salaries of 'A' grade foreign personnel include a component called "home country salary," which is converted at a rate of two shillings and six pence per tael to compensate for exchange rate losses. With the abolition of the tael system and the stabilization of the national currency, the so-called exchange rate compensation can be merged into the original salary at the silver dollar rate. A significant portion of the exchange rate compensation for home country salary should also be eliminated. Based on this approach, the committee will incorporate exchange rate compensation into the original salary at a rate of one shilling, two pence, and eight-thirds of a penny per national currency unit, establishing new salary grades, and then deduct eight percent. This amount will serve as the salary for foreign 'A' grade personnel after the adoption of this report. Moreover, the restrictions for new hires who have not completed five years of service and do not enjoy exchange rate compensation benefits, as well as married female employees who are ineligible for compensation, will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Adjustment Method</p>
<p>In the future, the salaries of most Public Works Bureau personnel should be calculated in silver dollars, eliminating existing exchange rate adjustments. However, to attract experts and technical personnel who must be hired from abroad, the linkage to foreign currency systems should not be entirely abolished. Therefore, the committee believes that over ninety 'A' grade employees should be eligible for exchange rate adjustments, while the current number of 'A' grade personnel enjoying exchange rate adjustment benefits is 867.</p>
<p>Promotion and Salary Increase Procedures</p>
<p>The committee believes that salary increases and promotions have been too rapid for middle-level personnel. The existing active salary increase method often results in many receiving high salaries. Therefore, new procedures should be established with fixed regulations for salary increases, and additional levels should be added. Currently, personnel promoted to one level immediately reach the highest salary for that level. In the future, they should be promoted through five levels (one level per year) to reach the maximum salary. Those currently promoted through four levels should be promoted through six levels. Furthermore, employees should not automatically receive the highest possible increase when promoted.</p>
<p>Retirement Benefits</p>
<p>According to existing regulations, retirement benefits consist of accumulated funds and pensions. The committee does not advocate changing the existing system. However, due to the amendments of 1931 and the adoption of this report, the majority of future retirement benefits will be accumulated funds, and the importance of pensions will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Accumulated Retirement Funds</p>
<p>According to current procedures, five percent of an employee's salary is deducted monthly for accumulated retirement funds, and the bureau adds ten percent to encourage loyalty. The committee proposes that for new employees, the bureau's ten percent contribution be reduced to five percent during the first five years of service. Furthermore, currently, foreign employees can convert half of their accumulated retirement funds at a rate of two shillings and six pence per tael upon retirement. The bureau's exchange rate liability is significant and inconsistent with financial principles. Therefore, the committee proposes abolishing this practice. Since the accumulated retirement funds of foreign 'A' grade employees will be based on adjusted salaries, they will not suffer losses. However, the exchange rate benefits already accrued on accumulated retirement funds should not be denied. Therefore, the committee proposes that when the recommendations in this report are implemented, the existing amounts be converted at the current rate for half the amount. The current procedure also allows employees to request conversion of their accumulated retirement funds to British pounds, U.S. dollars, or Japanese yen after one year of service. The committee proposes retaining this provision, subject to four months' prior notice to the bureau. Currently, the bureau guarantees interest on accumulated retirement funds at six percent for national currency and five percent for foreign currency. In the future, the interest rate should be the average interest rate for national and foreign currency deposits from the previous year.</p>
<p>Pension Calculation</p>
<p>The current method of calculating pensions is, simply put, that employees receive half their final salary upon retirement for support. Half the final salary, less the interest earned on accumulated retirement funds (calculated at five percent), constitutes the pension. The maximum pension amount is currently 4,000 taels. The committee proposes that the principle of this calculation remain unchanged, but the amount should be converted to an equivalent yuan amount. Currently, 'A' grade personnel can choose to receive payment in Chinese national currency or foreign currency upon retirement. The committee proposes that the bureau's obligation not be abruptly canceled. However, since the tael system has been abolished, the exchange rate should be one shilling, two pence, and eight-thirds of a penny per yuan, or twenty-nine and a half U.S. cents per hundred national currency units, or 102 and eight-thirds Japanese yen per hundred. It is anticipated that the exchange rate loss compensation for accumulated retirement funds and the exchange rate loss compensation on the salaries of 'B' grade personnel will be canceled, reducing the bureau's foreign exchange risk.</p>
<p>Position Classification</p>
<p>Currently, Public Works Bureau employees with employment contracts are classified into two grades: 'A' and 'L.' The committee proposes establishing a 'B' grade, into which 793 foreign employees from the current 'A' grade would be placed. Their treatment would be slightly inferior to 'A' grade, without exchange rate adjustment benefits, and with slight differences in long leave and travel expenses. According to the committee's opinion, the Public Works Bureau should prioritize hiring foreign personnel from the local area. All of the current 135 'L' grade personnel should also be hired locally.</p>
<p>New Long Leave Regulations</p>
<p>According to current regulations, 'A' grade foreign personnel are entitled to seven months of long leave after every five years of service, with travel expenses and exchange rate compensation paid by the bureau. The committee proposes that this long leave benefit be preserved for 'A' grade personnel and foreign-hired 'L' grade personnel. However, the long leave exchange rate compensation method should be slightly modified. All current long leave procedures will remain unchanged for 'A' grade personnel. However, new long leave procedures will be established for 'B' grade personnel hired locally, those with no affiliation in the country, and 'L' grade personnel. For this long leave, 'B' grade personnel accumulate three weeks per year, and 'L' grade personnel accumulate two weeks per year. Civil servants accumulate four weeks per year. After five years for 'B' grade and police personnel, and seven years for 'L' grade personnel, the bureau will provide travel expenses to and from their home country. Personnel who do not wish to return to their home country may combine their accrued long leave (three weeks per year) with short leave (three weeks per year). Furthermore, the current regulation allowing senior personnel, such as department heads, to take long leave once every four years will remain unchanged. Deputy department heads and junior supervisors will also be entitled to long leave once every four years after completing fifteen years of service.</p>
<p>Long Leave Exchange Rate Compensation</p>
<p>According to current procedures, the first 500 taels of an employee's salary during long leave are calculated at a rate of two shillings and six pence per tael. The committee proposes that this procedure not be canceled temporarily to accommodate lower-level foreign staff, but the initial 500 taels should be changed to 400 yuan, converted at a rate of one shilling and six pence per yuan.</p>
<p>Return Travel Expenses</p>
<p>The committee proposes that 'A' grade foreign personnel be entitled to first-class return travel expenses, and 'B' and 'L' grade personnel be entitled to second-class return travel expenses. These return travel expenses include expenses for their families, specifically return travel expenses for the employee, spouse, and two children.</p>
<p>Medical Expenses The committee proposes that the existing medical regulations not be modified temporarily. However, special medical treatment for sick employees, excluding work-related injuries and X-ray examinations necessary for diagnosis, will only be covered by the bureau after special approval by the Duty Officer Committee. Furthermore, medical expenses for employees' children are limited to two children, with age limits of sixteen for boys and seventeen for girls.</p>
<p>Employee Housing Municipal Tax In accordance with current regulations, Public Works Bureau employees' residences are exempt from municipal general tax (i.e., police tax) and property tax. The committee proposes that this tax exemption be discontinued. However, employees residing in bureau-owned or leased housing will not pay the tax.</p>
<p>Family Benefits Family benefits refer to the medical care and return travel expenses enjoyed by the wife and children of an employee after marriage. The committee proposes that 'B' grade foreign employees with salaries above 600 yuan and 'L' grade employees with six years of service and salaries above 400 yuan be eligible for these family benefits. However, police and fire personnel, and employees currently enjoying family benefits, will continue to receive them.</p>
<p>Widow's, Death, and Disability Benefits</p>
<p>Henceforth, any gratuities for widows of deceased employees, as well as for those disabled in service, would no longer include a foreign exchange rate adjustment. After the death of an 'A' employee, no gratuity will be granted to the widow, and after the death of 'B' and 'L' grade employees, the widow is eligible to receive the gratuity if they enjoyed family benefits and the salary does not exceed 800 yuan.</p>
<p>Sick Leave Benefits</p>
<p>Employees who have not completed three years of service may not enjoy the various benefits of sick leave without the special permission of the Duty Officer Committee. The duration of treatment in the Orient should be limited to three months.</p>
<p>Resignation After Long Leave Expiration</p>
<p>Any employee who voluntarily resigns after returning to Shanghai from long leave, before reaching retirement age, and within two years of returning to Shanghai, must, unless specifically permitted by the Board of Directors, return a portion of the long leave salary and travel expenses of the employee and their spouse, based on the length of service after returning to Shanghai.

<h3>Key Criminal in Robbery and Murder Case, Gao Hongbang, Interrogated Yesterday: Gao Claims False Accusation Due to Loan Shark Dispute, Court Announces Interrogation Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Zhang Juyang from Siyang, who operated as a loan shark, residing at 70 Yangshuyong Road, was invaded by multiple robbers at 9:45 PM on May 27 of last year. Valuables including clothes, banknotes, and silver coins worth 594 yuan were stolen. During their escape, the robbers shot and killed Zhang's friends, Chen Buzhao, and injured Zhang and another friend, Shi Jinzhu. After investigation, four suspects, Ma Jinbiao, Wang Jinsheng, Wang Fu, and others, were apprehended by the police and sent to the First Special District Court, where they were sentenced to various prison terms. They confessed that a person named Xiao Guanzi She was the mastermind behind the robbery and was on the run. On October 23 of this year, Chinese Detective Pang Jinshan from Yangshupu Police Station arrested Gao Hongbang (alias Xiao Guanzi), a native of Haizhou, at a bungalow on Haizhou Road and sent him to the court. Gao denied involvement in the robbery, claiming that he was staying with his friend Li Jihai near the Longwang Temple in Nanjing at that time, seeking employment without success, and returned to his hometown around June 2 of the lunar calendar. He was ordered to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing visited the Third Criminal Court for further interrogation. A reply from the Capital District Court stated that Li Jihai confirmed that Gao did stay at his house for about a month, but the dates were slightly different. According to Zhang Juyang and Shi Jinzhu, the defendant was acting as a lookout downstairs at the time and did not have a gun, and the shooter was a person with a scabby head and one unknown person. Gao Hongbang claimed that the accusation was due to a previous dispute over loan sharking and retained lawyer Fan Gang for defense. Judge Zhong ordered him to remain in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Files for Divorce: Husband Found Free of Venereal Disease, Both Parties Pay Ten Yuan for Examination Fee, Case Interrogated, Sentencing Scheduled for the 30th</h3>
<p>Zhang Mingfu, 20 years old, a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang, residing at 6 Ruichang Lane, Lan Weiai Road, French Concession, works as a clerk at Jianmian Cotton Firm on Sichuan Road. He married Jin Juxin, daughter of Jin Axin, also from the same hometown, through a matchmaker in March of last year. Not long after the marriage, Jin accused Zhang of having syphilis and retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special Court, seeking annulment of the marriage and divorce from Zhang Mingfu. Judge Ma Yishu held several hearings and ordered the defendant Zhang Mingfu to undergo a medical examination at a forensic medical clinic to determine if he had syphilis before further investigation. Yesterday morning, the case was continued after summons. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. The court presented the forensic examination report of Zhang Mingfu to both parties for review. It stated that the defendant had no evidence of chancroid or syphilis, only a chronic case of gonorrhea. The court also ordered both parties to pay an examination fee of ten yuan, deemed the facts of the case clear, and ordered opening statements. The court summoned the plaintiff's father, Jin Axin, to testify, who stated that he was 45 years old and had given birth to Cui Ju when he was 30 years old, thus she is 15 years old this year. Subsequently, the lawyers for both parties presented their arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer cited Article 345 of the Civil Code, stating that a woman under the age of sixteen cannot marry, and Article 1052, Section 2 of the Civil Code, requesting the court to annul the marriage and grant a divorce because the plaintiff is under sixteen years old. The defendant's response: (1) The plaintiff argues that a woman under sixteen cannot marry, but the plaintiff is actually eighteen years old. The father's testimony today is a fabricated statement. (2) The plaintiff cited Article 1052 of the Civil Code, stating that the defendant committed adultery, making it impossible to live together, and has abused and injured her. However, the defendant has been medically examined and found to be free of venereal disease, so how could there be adultery? As for the abuse, there is no evidence to support this claim and cannot constitute grounds for divorce. He requests that the plaintiff's claim be rejected. After the plaintiff's lawyer presented a rebuttal, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for the 30th.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui's Observation on the German-Japanese Agreement: Tang Shaoyi Visited Wang Yesterday Morning for Discussions</h3>
<p>Since the long-rumored German-Japanese agreement was signed and announced in Berlin the day before yesterday, diplomatic circles in Shanghai have been deeply concerned. Many believe that if the agreement is limited to jointly opposing communism, it is not objectionable. However, there is concern that its actual significance is not as simple as the announced content. A New Voice News Agency reporter interviewed Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the National Government's Foreign Affairs Committee, yesterday morning. According to Wang's observation, because the negotiations had already been leaked, causing a worldwide uproar, the two countries chose to publicly announce the agreement to avoid criticism. However, the specific organization and tasks of the joint standing committee formed by the two countries have not been announced, raising suspicions. There is concern that the agreement, while ostensibly aimed at opposing communism, may have other undisclosed meanings. Furthermore, Tang Shaoyi, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a long-time resident of Shanghai, rarely ventures out. Yesterday morning, at around 10:00 AM, Tang specifically visited Wang at his private residence on Masnan Road for lengthy discussions.</p>
<h3>Health Care Advancement Association: Medicine Supply Meeting, Preparation of Basic Supplies</h3>

In addition to the Chairman, who is a member ex-officio, Fang Yexian, Xu Xiangsun, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Bangjun, He Zikang, Tu Kaizheng, Zhu Yuquan, and Jia Chengyuan were publicly elected. (2) Formulation of Operating Procedures: It was resolved that Xu Guanqun and Zhou Bangjun would jointly formulate the procedures. (3) Setting the Date and Location of Regular Meetings: It was resolved that meetings would be held every Tuesday at 3:00 PM at the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Special meetings may be convened if necessary. (4) With the urgent need for medicines in the Suidong War, supply needs must be prepared in advance, otherwise, the front lines' requirements will not be met. It seems appropriate to prepare a batch of basic supplies in advance, and then supplement them once they are used. It was resolved to: (1) Appoint two to three persons responsible for the collection. (2) Obtain goods from manufacturers on credit before funds are raised, with the association responsible for repayment. (3) The budget for the supplies to be prepared is as follows (detailed list attached separately): Sera, 200 yuan; Cotton gauze, 1,100 yuan; Medicines, 1,000 yuan; Stretchers, 500 yuan; Cross cases, 1,000 yuan; Total, 3,800 yuan.

<h3>Yizhong Porcelain and Electrical Factory Workers Go on Strike, Management Reduces Wages and Cancels Preferential Treatment, Workers Submit Nine Demands Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Dagon Society reports: Over 250 workers at the Yizhong Fuji Machine Porcelain and Electrical Company's West Factory on Rue Hobbier in the French Concession have gone on strike due to the management's wage cuts and cancellation of Sunday double pay, night shift meal allowances, and other benefits. The workers petitioned the General Labor Union yesterday, presenting nine demands. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike</p>
<p>The Yizhong Fuji Porcelain and Electrical Company's West Factory has been established for over ten years. The general manager is Lin Zhijue, and it employs over 350 workers. The business has generally been prosperous, and the treatment of workers has been considered favorable. Recently, after Chen Jiqing took over as factory director, he continuously reduced wages and canceled previous benefits for workers, such as annual wage increases, subsidies for worker medical expenses, Sunday double pay, and night shift meal allowances. The workers sent representatives to demand restoration from the factory, but it was ineffective, causing public outrage among all workers, who began a spontaneous strike on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Nine Demands</p>
<p>After the workers went on strike, they sent representatives Wu Pan-gen, Xu Cheng-sheng, and a dozen others to petition the Municipal General Labor Union yesterday morning. Wan Banghe, a staff member of the union, received them. The workers then presented nine demands: (1) Restore original wages; (2) Increase current wages by 5/10 for everyone; (3) Stop work on Sundays, wages to be paid as usual, double pay for regular work; (4) Night work should be subsidized to workers as before, at one dollar per person; (5) Year-end double salary; (6) Compensation for worker injury or death due to work-related causes should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law; (7) Workers' requests for leave for personal matters should not be delayed or wages delayed; (8) Workers requesting extended leave must have their wages paid in full; (9) No dismissal of coworkers without cause. After further persuasion by the union representative, he agreed to work with Party and government agencies to mediate in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Promotion of Anti-Drug Propaganda, Increasing the Number of Beds in Detoxification Hospitals, Reducing the Number of Opium Dens in Stages</h3>
<p>Anti-drug propaganda in this city is currently being actively promoted. Since receiving the order from the Anti-Smoking Commissioner to expand publicity, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has drafted detailed measures to expand publicity and is currently submitting them to the Garrison Headquarters for review. It is expected that the headquarters will convene relevant parties for a meeting to discuss the matter within days. It is reported that the total number of beds in the city-run and designated detoxification hospitals and drug rehabilitation centers is only 182. There are many opium addicts in this city seeking to quit, and it is quite difficult to accommodate them. Therefore, it is now planned to find ways to increase the number of beds in order to meet the needs. There are currently eighty opium dens in this city, which are being reduced in stages.</p>
<h3>Goods Purchased Without Payment, Debt of 20,000 Gold, No Response as to Where the Goods Are Stored, Zhu Changjie Wanted by the Court</h3>
<p>Zhu Changjie opened the Xieshunxing Company at No. 36 Baifu Lane, Broadway Road, Hongkou, specializing in purchasing goods for merchants in other cities. Therefore, he had dealings with various companies in this city, such as Guanshengyuan, Taikang, Yuelai, Dingyu, Zhengyuantai, Dongyang, and Bei Wanyouquan. Unexpectedly, Zhu Changjie suddenly had malicious intentions and, in recent times, purchased a large quantity of goods worth over 20,000 yuan in national currency from 34 of the aforementioned companies. When the companies went to demand payment, he initially made excuses to evade them. When asked where the purchased goods were stored or sold, he could not give a clear answer. Subsequently, he avoided seeing them and entrusted lawyer Zhou Bingyang to announce a liquidation. Guanshengyuan and others were shocked upon learning of this because the company was an agent earning commission and should not have such debts. If the business was poor, why purchase such a large quantity of goods within a month? His actions clearly indicated fraud. Therefore, they retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Zhu Changjie in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant was absent. Lawyer Chen Tingrui presented the case and requested an arrest warrant. The court decided to reschedule the case for a hearing on the 7th of next month. The defendant Zhu Changjie was granted an arrest warrant.</p>

<h3>Fire at Xujiahui Destroys Ten Houses</h3>
<p>At 1:40 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the tailor shop Shunjixi, opened by Changzhou native Wang Juchun at No. 2144 Rue Zikawei in the Chinese district of Xujiahui. The cause of the fire is unknown. The entire Wang family was awakened from their sleep and fled. Flames immediately broke through the roof, and the fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. It then spread to over ten neighboring properties, including Zhang Xiaoquan's scissor shop at No. 2146, the Zhaisentaichin Pi shop at No. 2148, the Yun Ji Meat store at No. 2150, the Jinfang Xing rattan chair shop at No. 2152, the Lu Gaojian Meat store at No. 2142, the Xushun Xing clothing store at No. 1240, Zhang Ji's lacquer shop at No. 2138, Wu Yixing's bamboo shop at No. 2136, and the Dongfang Bookstore at No. 2134. Yi Gongding, the director of the Xujiahui Police Station in charge of the area, personally led armed police officers to the scene to maintain order. He also notified fire departments in various districts to drive to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, because the area lacked a fire department and there were no fire hydrants installed, the water pressure was weak, and it was not easy to extinguish the fire immediately. It was not until 2:10 AM that the fire was extinguished. A total of ten houses were burned. Wang Juchun, the source of the fire, was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning yesterday.</p>

<h3>China Merchants 14th Route Tram Still Drove to the South Station Yesterday, Driver Yan Caifa Seriously Injured, Union Asks Party and Government Agencies to Intervene</h3>
<p>Dagon Society reports: At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Route 4 tram of the China Merchants Tram Company was traveling from Gaochangmiao to Nanyangqiao. When the tram arrived at the South Railway Station, more than 30 soldiers from the Arsenal Guard Division crowded onto the tram. Because the ticket seller, Wang Xianglin, saw that there were too many people, he asked them to board in batches. This caused a misunderstanding and conflict. The driver, Yan Caifa, was beaten by the soldiers with leather belts, and his head was injured. He was bleeding profusely. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Routes 1 and 4 trams were all suspended. Later, officials from Party and government agencies sent people to persuade them to resume operation but only went to the South Railway Station before turning around. Today, the injured worker is seriously injured due to excessive blood loss. Unless something changes, his life may be in danger. The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union of the factory believes that the guard soldiers were arrogant and violent, expressing indignation. They have submitted a written report of the incident and requested the Party and government agencies to intervene seriously. Before a resolution is reached, the Route 1 and 4 trams will definitely not drive into Gaochangmiao.</p>
<h3>Someone from a Certain Country Stole Goods While Shopping, Such Events Have Been Heard Recently in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>Rural News reports: Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway, the town of Zhuanqiao, which belongs to Shanghai County, has seen its commerce become increasingly prosperous. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two people from a certain country suddenly came to Sun Yongshun's grocery store on South Street and used a five-yuan Central Bank banknote to buy five packs of Golden Mouse brand cigarettes. Zhou Yunxiang, a shop assistant, gave them five packs of Golden Mouse cigarettes and checked the drawer, but there was no change. He went to Sun Yongshun's rice store to exchange money (which was run by the uncle of Sun Boying, the owner of Sun Yongshun's grocery store). One of the people from a certain country followed. Because the rice store also did not have change, they refused, which caused them to receive a glare from this person. Zhou Yunxiang returned the five-yuan banknote to the person from a certain country and went to He Xingxian's He Yongxing Souvenir Shop, which was located diagonally across, to buy the original number of Golden Mouse brand cigarettes. The shop owner, He Xingxian, took the five-yuan banknote to the counter. One of the people from a certain country followed him into the store and insisted on receiving one-yuan Central Bank banknotes as change. He picked and chose for a long time before finally taking a one-yuan Central Bank banknote and change, and then left. Many people said that similar things have happened recently in other towns such as Beiqiao and Minhang, with mostly stolen banknotes. The owner, He Xingxian, counted the banknotes in the counter, and forty yuan (eight five-yuan notes) had disappeared. In the future, if similar things are found, please pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Those Who Became Addicted Again After Quitting Opium Can Surrender This Year to Avoid Punishment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Smoking Association received instructions yesterday from the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee stating, "According to the Yunyun County Anti-Smoking Committee's report, 'Regarding item one of the matters discussed at the 32nd Committee meeting of this association, the provincial order states that all opium addicts are limited to surrender for detoxification by the end of this year to be exempt from punishment. If a self-surrendered offender is found to have become addicted to drugs after quitting opium, should they all be considered self-surrendered opium addicts? Please discuss.' The decision was recorded to be reported to the provincial government for verification. It is reasonable to record the case and report it to you, asking you to examine and instruct us to follow it.' Accordingly, the meeting transferred a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for verification and interpretation. Now, permission has been granted within the confidential letter No. 1173 of November 3, stating, 'With regards to your association's letter No. 689 of October 28, 25, based on the Yunyun County Anti-Smoking Committee's report, for self-surrendered offenders who have become addicted to drugs after quitting opium, should they be considered self-surrendered opium addicts? Please provide an interpretation.' After investigating the matter, those who became addicted to drugs after quitting opium and surrendered on their own can be considered self-surrendered opium addicts. This is now approved, and this is sent in reply for your verification and to instruct that this is known.' Accordingly, in addition to instructing the Yunyun County Association and branch offices, this order is issued to notify the association to be informed of this order. The association has already notified the various district offices."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Is Sickly</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun, "The peculiar endemic disease of the Yangtze River, and the scrofula-like disease of Shanghai, have recently spread among the Japanese people, causing great panic in all quarters." The scrofula-like disease of Shanghai usually prevails in April, May, September, and October. This year, it is still rampant even in November, which doctors consider strange. According to Dr. Hino, a Japanese doctor, this disease was discovered around 1800, but its source has not yet been determined. Dr. Mizuno of the Institute of Natural Sciences has been using special equipment to study it carefully, but it is still unclear. Doctors have proposed theories of germs, poisoning, and even mite-like insects. In addition to the face, the symptoms have now spread to the hands, feet, chest, skin, and mucous membranes. If it invades the stomach, it turns into stomach cancer. The majority of those affected are middle-aged, with fewer children. Currently, the only treatment is with X-rays. In addition, smallpox and typhoid fever have recently been rampant, with children being the most affected.</p>

At around 7:00 PM the night before, four robbers with a Chongming accent suddenly dug a large hole in the wall of Wu's house. They broke in, each holding sharp weapons, and tied up all the men and women in the family, warning them not to make a sound. They then rummaged through the boxes and cabinets and searched for anything of value. They robbed 26 yuan in cash, one gold ring, one gold bracelet, one gold chain, over ten pieces of clothing, and four dou of white rice. The robbers, having looted everything they could, left with their loot, shouting loudly. Afterwards, the victim reported the robbery to the police station in charge for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor, the "Dog Litigation" article in the Shanghai News section of your paper on the 25th is not in accordance with the facts. We are providing a detailed account of the facts for your correction. On the day in question, the cook from this residence took the dog out and passed by the residence of Mrs. Pan Zhu. The dog encountered the dog kept by the Mrs. Pan Zhu. Due to the dogs' nature, they started barking at each other. As the dogs were fighting, three or four people came out of the house and dragged the hunting dog inside the house. They then started beating the dog with equipment. The cook tried to pull the dog out but mistakenly injured his finger. Having no choice, he ran back to the residence and told the matter to Zhiying. Zhiying immediately went to investigate and saw that the house was tightly closed. The dog was dragged out, on the verge of death. Therefore, he knocked on the door to advise them that animals should not be treated in such an abusive manner, and persuaded them not to do it again. However, they refused to open the door. At the time, bystanders expressed their indignation. The reports in your paper stating that they broke into Mrs. Pan Zhu's house, frightened the children, and caused trouble for the police are not true. The neighbors of Mrs. Pan Zhu can testify to this. This matter is extremely minor, and Zhiying does not want to investigate it further. However, given what has happened, he has to state the facts. He hopes that the editor will publish this. Sincerely, Dong Zhiying.</p>

<h3>The Enamel Industry in Shanghai (Continued) (General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 38)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of the Chinese WeChat</p>
<p>(4) Sales and Market Conditions of Enamel Products</p>
<p>The sales channels for enamel products from various factories have varied considerably over time with changes in the circumstances. During the May Fourth Movement, Japanese enamel products were completely rejected, and domestic products suddenly sold well. Since then, the annual sales volume has generally been around 6-7 million yuan. However, in recent years, the markets in Northeast and North China have been almost entirely controlled by Japanese enamel products. At the same time, the adverse trend of economic depression has been surging, and its impact has greatly hit the sales channels of enamel products from various factories. For example, the full-year sales volume for 24 years was only over 4 million yuan, which is 40% less than before. We should consider ways to salvage this downward trend. The sales situation this year is mediocre. Since August, firstly due to the change in weather, and secondly due to the gradual approach of the autumn harvest, customers' needs and purchasing power for enamel products have increased, providing a good opportunity for factories to ship their goods. The findings of our survey are as follows:</p>

<h3>Zhengting Cup Golf Handicap Annual Competition: Yang Guang荣 Wins Championship; Jian Chonghan's Wife Takes Second Place; Jian Chonghan Takes Third</h3>
<p>Golf is an outdoor sport of the highest quality. People from both the East and West enjoy it, as it can regulate the spirit and cultivate temperament. Politicians and diplomats, in particular, often enjoy it and frequently use it for diplomatic negotiations. Many important figures in our country's party, government, and military also love this sport, such as General Zhang Xueliang and Ambassador Wang Zhengting. Recently, members of the gentry and business communities have also started to learn it, and their interest and achievements are increasing daily. For example, recently, Mr. Jian Chonghan defeated the famous player Mr. Brown in the Shanghai Senior Golf Championship finals, winning the宝座that Chinese people had never touched before. This can be considered a new era in the history of Chinese golf.</p>
<p>Vice President Kong, General Zhang Xueliang, and Ambassador Wang Zhengting, in order to enhance the interest of the Chinese people in this sport, each donated a large silver cup to the Shanghai Chinese Golf Club to initiate the Handicap Championship Annual Competition (i.e., a handicap competition, because people's skills vary, this method is used to balance the strength and increase the interest in the competition). Since its inception, the members of each club have been very excited, and the past results have been very satisfactory. The competition for the Zhengting Cup annual event was held at the golf course in the city center on the 25th. Sixteen participants, all members of the Chinese Golf Club, participated. It was stipulated to determine the winner in two weeks, with nine holes each week, totaling eighteen holes. Mr. Yang Guang Sheng, relying on his experienced technique and enthusiastic spirit, completed his game with 45 strokes in the first week and 46 strokes in the second week, for a total of 91 strokes. Mr. Yang's handicap was 18 (i.e., giving 18 strokes), so his net score was 73 (the lower the score, the better). He won this year's championship by defeating Mrs. Jian Chonghan by a difference of six strokes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jian was the only woman among all the players and was able to win the second place (79 strokes is not easy). Moreover, this is the second time Mrs. Jian has won second place. In the previous Zhang Xueliang Cup, her score was only second to her husband (Mr. Jian Chonghan was the champion of the Zhang Xueliang Cup). Mrs. Jian's deep attainments can be seen from this. If compared to other sports competitions, her level of achievement is probably even better than those of Miss Yang Xiuqiong, Qian Xingsu, and Li Sen.</p>
<p>Mr. Jian Chonghan finished with 79 strokes, and his actual score was the best of all, but his handicap required him to add two strokes, resulting in a score of 81, and he had to settle for third place. Mr. Li Guojian, Mr. Tan Wei Xue, and Mr. Chen Yiming tied for fourth place with 83 strokes each. Although the weather was not good during yesterday's competition, and it suddenly rained midway through the competition, the players were spirited and undaunted, and they continued as usual to complete the annual competition. The results of the fourteen players are listed below.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' Middle School Track and Field Meet: Held Today at Shen Garden</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' Middle School will hold its autumn sports meet today (27th) at the Shen Garden football field on Yanping Road. It is heard that the school's physical education director, Chen Yongsheng, has recently returned from a study tour of Europe and deeply feels that the health of the Chinese people is far inferior to that of Europe and America. This is because national physical education has failed to pay attention to popularization, especially the physical education of women. Therefore, this year's school sports meet will adopt a system of total mobilization of all students. All students must participate in at least three skill performances. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>Main Points of Social Education Promotion in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has dispatched a large number of supervisors to various provinces and cities this year for inspection. In addition to focusing on the inspection of compulsory education, the inspection of social education is also included. The Ministry of Education has issued numerous instructions over the years to promote social education, with a large number of key points. The responsible department has compiled a summary of these points as a standard for inspection. The main points are as follows: (1) "Regarding Funding": Starting from the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the percentage of social education funding in the total education expenditure of each province, city, and county should be between 10% and 20%. Starting from the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the percentage of social education funding in the newly added education expenditure should be at least 30% in each city and 30% to 50% in each county. (2) "Literacy Education for Out-of-School Adults": People's schools should be used as venues for supplementary education, and the supplementary education should include civic education and literacy education. When convenient, self-defense training may be implemented. Each province and city should popularize this within six years, starting from the 25th year of the Republic (1936). Each county and city should add 20 to 40 people's schools each year, and each school should run two sessions each year, each session lasting three to six months. The principle is to run two classes, each with 50 people. When implementing, it should start with men and women aged 16 to 30, and then gradually extend to older or younger people. Compulsory enrollment may be implemented. Textbooks may be issued free of charge by the Ministry of Education, and supplementary textbooks should be compiled by local authorities. The education administrative organs in charge of each province and city should draft an implementation plan each year and report it to the Ministry before July 15th each year. The above plan for the 25th year of the Republic (1936) should be reported to the Ministry before September 15th. Recurring expenses should be raised by the counties themselves, and provincial subsidies should be provided when necessary. The public should also be encouraged to donate. (3) "Public Education Centers": These are the central institutions for implementing local social education. They should conduct activities related to health, literacy, civics, livelihood, household affairs, social interaction, leisure, and various types of education, and engage in research and experimental work. In terms of budget allocation, salaries should not exceed 50%, program expenses should not be lower than 40%, and office expenses should account for 10%. This year, the main task should be to guide the people's schools within their respective counties and districts, in order to promote the implementation of supplementary education for out-of-school adults. "Radio Education": Secondary schools and people's education centers in each province and city must install radios. Secondary schools must complete the installation by the end of December of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and people's education centers must complete the installation by the end of June of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). The education departments in each province and city should designate one staff member in the department responsible for social education to handle radio education administration and allocate special funds for radio education. Each province and city should delineate radio education guidance zones throughout the region, and each zone should have one instructor to handle radio education matters within the zone. They should also formulate measures to subsidize schools and centers in installing radio receivers and subsidize schools and centers in impoverished areas. Provinces and cities with financial difficulties may receive subsidies from the Ministry of Education for part or all of the cost of purchasing radio receivers, depending on the circumstances. They should also formulate reward and punishment measures for radio education personnel. The radio reception situation in each school and center should be used as one of the criteria for evaluating the performance of the school or center during inspection. (5) "Film Education": The education departments in each province and city should designate one staff member in the department responsible for social education to handle film education administration and allocate special funds for film education. Each province should delineate educational film mobile screening zones throughout the region and establish screening personnel in each zone to handle educational film screenings. The Ministry of Education will coordinate the procurement or manufacture of screening equipment and issue it to the education departments in each province and city for use at a set price. However, provinces with real financial difficulties may receive subsidies from the Ministry of Education for part of the cost of purchasing equipment. All educational films will be distributed free of charge by the Ministry of Education in a coordinated manner.</p>

<h3>Half a Day at the Source of the Tama River</h3>
<p>— Thinking</p>
<p>The season of summer is fleeting and approaching its end. Girls returning with travel bags and small suitcases, their faces and half-exposed arms etched with the brown-red brand of the sea and the seaside sun, are becoming increasingly common on platforms and in train carriages. When their proud figures are reflected in my eyes, I cannot help but sigh inwardly: "This year's dream of sea bathing is again just a dream, even though I have come to this seaside capital!"</p>
<p>Indeed, having arrived in Tokyo, I haven't taken a single step outside the city, being absurdly "busy with nothing." Although the sea is not meant for me, I am determined to take a trip to a place with water in the suburbs during the late summer. The travel advertisement paintings that I see every day on the platform, depicting azure mountains, silver streams, and red campfires in the wilderness, have made me choose Okutama as my first destination for "exploration" in Japan. I finally managed to invite two friends, and after an hour's ride on a suburban train, passing through fields planted with fir forests, mulberry trees, and dryland crops, we arrived at Okutama. Following the instructions in the tourist pamphlet, we took an eight-minute cable car ride, ascending as if to heaven, to first visit the shrine on Mount Mitake.</p>
<p>The mountain road was almost as flat as the ground. Women wearing high-toothed wooden clogs also walked leisurely, dragging their feet along. When we reached a "viewing platform" on the mountainside, we looked around and saw countless mountains, far and near, arranged in rows, but they were not chaotic mountains with grotesque rocks, but rather densely covered with forests of green, a group of mountains that were soft and verdant, and refreshingly invigorating in the yellow morning light.</p>
<p>The closer we got to the shrine, the more ancient the trees became. In addition to the straight firs that were dozens of feet tall, there were also pines and cypresses that were gnarled and twisted. The shrine's architecture was not magnificent, and it was somewhat dilapidated. However, what caught our attention the most was the countless wooden plaques hanging in front of the shrine, each inscribed with "So-and-so donated so many thousands or tens of thousands of seedlings." The mountains of Japan are not barren, and it is thanks to the generosity of these pious men and women.</p>
<p>After lingering in front of the shrine for a while, we went down the mountain to look for a waterfall called "Shichiri-taki." After taking a rugged path with few people for six or seven li, we heard the clear, zither-like sound of water. A few steps further, we arrived at the waterfall. The murmuring spring falling from dozens of feet and the pool of emerald water had already permeated the surrounding rocks, grass, and trees with a quiet chill, and we also felt a hint of coolness, but the scale was too small, far inferior to the Hundred-Foot Cliff of Mount Tai or the Yellow Dragon Pool of Mount Lu. We couldn't help but be disappointed, especially since I love waterfalls so much. This is because my first childhood trip was to the Feishuitan Pond in my hometown of Dinghu. Under the overlapping branches and leaves that dripped with green, the magnificent silver flow of splashing and rushing water and the bottomless pool of clear blue, plus the story of the蛟龙 (jiao dragon), and the absurd legends about the depth of the pool, left a particularly deep and vivid initial impression in my memory. Although I have been close to many scenic springs and waterfalls in recent years, I always felt that they lacked the misty quality of that dream. Needless to say, this Shichiri-taki was even more so. If the Okutama area was all like this, our trip would have been in vain.</p>
<p>Turning back to the shrine and following the path down the mountain, we planned to go to the source of the Tama River. Walking along the winding path along the mountainside, passing one mountain after another, the places exposed to the constant sunshine were steaming with the severe midday heat, while the shady paths through the misty woods were rippling with cool mountain breezes. One mountain divided the seasons into autumn and summer, and our shirts alternately soaked and dried.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the rushing sound of water, mixed with the choking and surging of rapid currents, composed a sad little symphony, which was first sent to our ears by the wind. Between the branches and leaves of the tall forests and trees in front, draped in pale golden sunlight, there were also glimpses of shimmering snow and strings of trembling silver. We couldn't help but quicken our pace.</p>
<p>When we reached the stream, a narrow white wooden bridge with red railings stretched across our eyes. Standing at the head of the bridge and looking out, we truly felt as if we were in a familiar, typical Oriental landscape: the swirling white rapids, the densely leaning dark green maple trees and miscellaneous trees by the stream, the Japanese-style pavilions hidden among the trees, silently playing with the water, and the tourists leaning on the stones and gazing at the water, all seemed to be melting into the endless stillness of the summer painting. Looking back, there were several layers of azure distant mountains lying at the end of the stream, and a pile of clear white clouds floating in the sky, adding a touch of seclusion and remoteness to this painting.</p>
<p>At the end of the bridge was a tea house that sold tea, protruding into the gorge. The bark roof and the unadorned natural wood cross-sections made into low tables were all very suitable for such a stream and mountain. We leaned against the railing of the pavilion, sat on the ground, and stretched our feet out over the railing, hanging them casually. In the elegant music of the water that was constantly playing, in the gentle waves of the wind that rippled from time to time, we experienced a kind of relaxed "leisure."</p>
<p>We continued to walk along the stream, and the road was a paved motor road winding along the mountain and facing the stream. The stream's currents sometimes swift and sometimes slow, the sunshine sometimes open and sometimes closed, and the different styles of the bridges, all gave the gorges along the way a different charm while still maintaining a similar atmosphere. Every two or three li, there were tourist advertisement signs with words like "Scenic Spot" and "Famous Place." Since it was getting late, we dared not linger everywhere. When we reached a place called "Pigeon's Nest," dusk had already crept in prematurely. However, our curiosity was attracted by this somewhat strange name, and we couldn't help but follow the instructions on the road sign and walk towards the gorge. After crossing a winding and precarious bridge made of boards, we reached the middle of the gorge. The particularly chaotic and craggy piles of rocks created several waterfalls-like rapids. After the rapids passed, they accumulated into a deep blue pool. In the thin, floating, blank twilight, the water and trees looked like an ancient painting that had been smoked dark by the years, appearing even softer and quieter. The sound of the spring water was like the sound of a neighbor's zither heard when one awoke from a drunken dream, seeming even more misty. The clear stream water further tempted us to take off our coats, trousers, shoes, and socks, and plunge our feet into the stream, fully enjoying the cool sensation.</p>
<p>"Look," one of my companions exclaimed with a smile, "Japanese university students are still university students wherever they go!"</p>
<p>I looked around and saw a young man wearing a university student hat rolling up the legs of his suit trousers, walking a bit unsteadily into the water. After taking a few steps, he returned to the shore, his mortarboard still on his head. I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to cup some water and bring it to my mouth, with a whoosh, a small fish more than two inches long was hit by the turbulent water and thrown onto a rock, rolled around, and then slipped back down.</p>
<p>"There are fish too!" I shouted.</p>
<p>"You only know that now? There are people catching fish ahead!" a companion who had been sitting on a rock and gazing for a long time replied.</p>
<p>In the deep water three or four zhang away from us, there was indeed a nearly naked black man standing, holding something that looked like a wooden bucket in one hand, and probably holding a fish in the other. He would sometimes cover his face with the wooden bucket and half-submerge himself in the water, and then stand up again. We sat on the rock and watched him intently. The coldness created by the sound and color of the water, which grew deeper with the dusk, made our chilled skin feel a bit thinly clad, but the man still didn't seem to be able to catch a single small fish.</p>
<p>"Laughing at that university student? We're just the pot calling the kettle black!" one of my companions seemed to realize.</p>
<p>As the express train on the way back sped through the gray forests and fields against the suddenly tightening evening wind, the full moon had already appeared from behind the silver-gray mountains. We only regretted not lingering longer at the source of the Tama River, to create a dream of the creek and mountains under the moonlight.</p>
<h3>VIPs Not Invited</h3>
<p>— Drawing</p>
<h3>Farmers and Children</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Once I passed by the Liling River.</p>
<p>What surprised me was when I passed by the fertile fields here and saw the naked farmers raising their reddish-purple faces to the sun and roaring, like hundreds of oxen afflicted by the summer heat venting their grievances that cannot be uttered. Why was that? It was as quiet here as a green blackboard, and had they already found the source of their suffering in that monotonous life?</p>
<p>As I walked, I was captivated by the sparse distant mountains on the horizon outside the village, and stopped my hungry steps. At first glance, the mountains seemed to number only three or four, but soon I discovered countless peaks behind them, revealing half a face or a pointed head, appearing and disappearing indistinctly. Under the relentless smelting of the pure blue sky by the flame of unadulterated high heat, they appeared even more greatly silent. I loved them to the point of wanting to jump into their arms in one step, and disturb their tranquility with my shouts.</p>
<p>On the road that cut straight through the arc-shaped boundary of Zengshi Village, there were heavy vehicles carrying horses ridden by officers in gray uniforms, and porters carrying ammunition boxes, briefcases, tables, chairs, and boilers, hurrying back and forth. Firewood-gathering woodcutters stood angrily to the side, staring blankly at them as they passed.</p>
<p>I understood why those naked farmers were raising their reddish-purple faces to the sun and roaring in the golden fields. They were guarding their hard-earned harvests, not allowing outside intruders, whether famine-stricken victims, roaming bandits, or migrating soldiers, to seize them. Could there be anything in the world more appropriate for shouting than this terrifying premonition?</p>
<p>Outside a lonely white-walled house by the river, I asked two small children:</p>
<p>"Are you afraid? What is it?"</p>
<p>A seven-year-old girl named Adi and a five-year-old boy named Aping. These rural children, thirty or forty li from the small county town, were as strong and agile as newly born foals. The siblings were putting aside everything and playing with a fat hen. They were trying to catch her, jumping and laughing, and rolling in the dust on the ground. She fled into the bamboo forest in a panic, but after a while, she walked out with a leisurely and nonchalant air, strutting her full chest and pecking at the small insects on the ground. As soon as the children approached her, she would dart away to a distant place before stopping.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what? We're not afraid at all!"</p>
<p>Aping answered me, but he was immediately grabbed by his sister.</p>
<p>Adi admonished him very solemnly.</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" she rebuked, "Watch out for a smack... Where are you from (she turned to me), why don't you ask me? I know—there's going to be shooting in our village."</p>
<p>"Who's going to be shooting?"</p>
<p>"They. They're coming to our village to shoot."</p>
<p>"Who told you these things?" I asked, trembling.</p>
<p>"Who told me? Why would I need someone to tell me!"</p>
<p>I painfully left them and walked out of the woods.</p>

<h3>Reading Diligence · Miscellaneous Writings on O'Neill's Plays (2)</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Naturally, what I have said and written above is not a faithful introduction to O'Neill, but merely an expression of my personal feelings. Like blind men touching an elephant, even though they can tell people the shape of the elephant's trunk, tail, leg, belly, and tusk, the entire shape of the elephant remains vague. Dear readers, you must regard me as a blind man, and what I say, write, and depict, you must regard as the shape of an elephant's trunk, tail, leg, belly, and tusk. Then you may not be disappointed, and I may be able to continue writing. I must tell you that my most common mistake is that my articles often stray beyond the topic I have set. If such an article were handed to an old gentleman wearing reading glasses, he would at least give ten slaps to the palm of the hand. Let you also鞭策（spur） me, like the old gentleman wearing reading glasses, and I will also restrain myself, not exceeding the scope of the topic, like a literary apprentice. Pull the topic back from outside the scope to within the scope. Before that, I must have a request, let me pretend to be a drama critic, pretend to be someone who understands O'Neill's plays, and do not expose my pretense, do not frighten away my courage. However, even assuming this, I am still somewhat discouraged. When I watch a play, I get visual pleasure; when I listen to a musical drama, I get auditory pleasure. But when I pick up a pen to write, I only have pain, and no happiness. I stare blankly at the white paper in front of me. What should I write? Where should I start? This is a question that is problematic for both me and you. We know that when we open any script, the first thing that catches our eyes are the characters on stage, so I will seize this point and start by talking about the characters in O'Neill's plays.</p>
<p>I also have to learn from the predecessors who criticized old novels, holding a red pen to 点将 (point generals), to call out the characters in O'Neill's plays one by one to comment on them. This may be a more objective method, but it is also the most clumsy, and it will not be able to cover so many characters. The method I am taking now is just to classify his characters in general and explain them. Naturally, this is also similar to blind men touching an elephant. According to some American critics, the male characters in O'Neill's plays have two typical characters with opposite personalities: one is the type with large, dark eyes, a slender, poetic temperament, sensitive and with inner suffering often expressed on the face; the other is the type that is opposite to this, with small, blue eyes, and a strong body, and whose temperament tends to be pragmatic. In the play "Beyond the Horizon," we can find the character Robert Mayo as a representative of the former. According to O'Neill's description, this character is: "A tall and slender youth of about twenty-three years old. On his lofty forehead and large, gloomy eyes, there is a slight poetic expression. His form is delicate and elegant, and his mouth and lower jaw tend to be thin." His brother Andrew's personality is exactly the opposite of his. He is described by O'Neill as "twenty-seven years old, the opposite type of Robert--vulgar, sun-tanned, with a robust masculine beauty--a son of the earth, quick to manage affairs but clumsy in intelligence." In "The Great God Brown," we can also find these two clearly divided types existing. The character presented to us in the play, "William Brown," is described as "almost eighteen years old, a tall and well-built athlete. He is fair-skinned, blonde, and blue-eyed, with an easily laughing, frank, and happy face. His expression already shows a kind of sophisticated restraint. His attitude has an easy self-confidence of ordinary intelligence." From O'Neill's description of the "frank and happy face," "sophisticated restraint," and "ordinary intelligence," we can already know which type Brown belongs to. Let's look further, we see the protagonist "Dion Anthony." "He is as tall as the young Brown, but slender and thin, without quiet, constantly in restless, nervous action. His face is wearing a mask. This mask is his own face--dark, intelligent, poetic, passionately transcendentally sensitive, like a child without assistance, with a religious love for life--an external fixed restraint, making it a kind of insult, negligence resistance, happily mocking and indulgent "Pan"-like expression." Dion Anthony is actually somewhat similar to "Robert Mayo." From these two people, we can see that in O'Neill's plays, there are two types of characters with opposite personalities: one is a slender, dark-eyed, sensitive, and poetic hero, and the other is a solid, athletic, and intelligent supporting character. These two types can almost be found in most of his plays.</p>
<p>Similarly, in his other play "The Straw," the three male protagonists there also have the same characteristics as mentioned above. "Bill Carmody," O'Neill describes him as: "A man of fifty years old, with a robust physique, broad shoulders, and long, thick, muscular arms, with hairy hands. His face is thin and clumsy, his nose is short and flat, his mouth is large, his buttocks are thick and not agile, his skin is mottled--reddish-purple and freckled, his hair is short and untidy? The top of his head is bald. The expression in his small blue eyes is one of selfish cunning." And for another protagonist, "Fred Nicholls," O'Neill also describes him as: "He is a young fellow of twenty-three years old, with a solid physique, beautiful hair, not surprisingly beautiful, in the old-fashioned style. His attitude is very clearly to pretend to be an elegant upper-class person: he is always full of smiles, but in his small, attentive blue eyes, there is an expression of petty calculation." For another character, "Stephen Murray," O'Neill describes him as: "Murray is a man of thirty years old--a slender, thin, and strangely faced fellow, his face is pale, sunken in high cheekbones, and divided by two eyes and a mouth, depression and haggardness at such a young age. His intelligent and large dark eyes, when at rest, have an expression of fatigue and dejection, but once his inner secrets are violated, he will immediately respond with that kind of mocking humor. His attitude is expressed by his talking--easily irritated, suspicious, and cautious--looks like an acquired nature, more than any part of his nature." It is obvious that in the personality of this "Stephen Murray," we can find many of his characteristics similar to Dion Anthony. Furthermore, "Carmody" and "Fred Nicholls" are also characters in the play with the characteristics of his supporting characters.</p>
<p>In the play "Different," although we cannot find a male character in the play who is the opposite of the protagonist "Caleb Williams," this character has the above two personalities. O'Neill describes him as "a tall man with a strong physique, nearly thirty years old. Black hair, sharp black eyes, a rough and uneven face, with a copper color, and although his mouth is stubborn, it is quite kind." From this point of view, "Williams lacks many of the characteristics of other characters in the play, but the author is temporarily calm and not impatient, and as the play is read, in the second act, you can also find that O'Neill adds to the character of his character: "His face, with a fixed expression under an emotional mask, but his eyes cannot hide an inner struggle, a troublesome and painful effort to know, a haggard description that has been hurt by the unknown." After such a suggestion, revealing his face, he is also a character with the same flesh and blood emotions in O'Neill's plays.</p>
<p>Another "troubled" hero, "All God's Chillun Got Wings" in the "Jim Harris", "A black child with a strangely troubled sensitive face. Because this character is black, we can assume that the black is O'Neill's typical character - another attitude of the big dark eyes role. "Desire Under the Elms", also has such a black-eyed troubled sensitive soul. Similarly, "Maggie Cape" in "Welded" is also such a hero. "Orin Mannon" in "Mourning Becomes Electra" is another attitude of the same role. Enough, these "calling names of generals." "Lao Tzu, with one breath 化之淸 (transformed into purity)", we can also say the same, O'Neill's central character, transformed into many different attitudes. Some people may say that such a view is inevitably a subjective error. But I have already told you that I am just like a blind man touching an elephant. Understand this, then there is no need to be harsh on me.</p>
<p>I have already described the personalities of the male protagonists in O'Neill's plays above, then can we mechanically summarize the female protagonists in his plays into several types in this way? Using a mathematical mind to analyze literary works may in itself be an absurd thing. But don't worry about it for now, let me try to see how it goes.</p>
<p>The female protagonists in O'Neill's plays, although not like the male protagonists in his plays, have two very obvious types, but we can find a common feature, that is, the characters inside are all suffering from perverted sexuality, so the women in his plays are rarely not prostitutes, or lewd women, or sex maniacs. Let me also call the generals one by one, as I did in the section about the male characters in his play. The female characters in "Thirst" are like this. The female protagonist in "Long Voyage Home" is like this. The female characters in "The Web" are like this. The women in "Moon of the Caribbees" are like this. "Matt" and "Anna" in "Anna Christie" are like this. The women in "Welded" are like this. "Cybel" in "The Great God Brown" is like this; The female character Pompeia in "Lazarus Laughed" is like this. These women are all prostitutes. Others such as "Ada and "Mrs. Fife" in "Dynamo", "Abbie Putnam" in "Desire Under the Elms", "Eleanor Cape" in "Welded", and "Christine Mannon" in "Mourning Becomes Electra", are all women with unsatisfied sexual desires, while "Emma Crosby" in "Different", and "Nina" in "Strange Interlude" are women with eroticism.</p>
<p>There are also many normal roles among the female protagonists in O'Neill's plays, but I don't know if O'Neill deliberately wanted to make his plays attractive, or if his nature, according to Freud's theory, has sadism, he often expresses his contempt for such female characters in his plays. Almost all such characters in his plays are portrayed as narrow-minded, petty, stubborn, and lacking understanding. Their personalities are exactly the opposite of those with sexual perversions. Those people are physically trampled, but their spirits are noble, sympathetic, and understanding. Such a contrast is fully expressed in "The Great God Brown." In this play, the reader first sees "Dion Anthony's" wife "Margaret." She is a normal woman, and what O'Neill calls "the eternal woman who maintains the continuation of the race." She loves her husband because he is intelligent, poetic, and romantic, but she never discovers his true personality hidden behind the mask. Later, when he takes off the mask and reveals what a true personality he is, she becomes afraid of him and does not recognize him. This is more of a satire on ordinary women than a satire on the whole of humanity. On the other hand, the prostitute "Cybel" is Dion's understander, and he goes there to get sympathy and comfort. The relationship between the two is Platonic love. She is his adviser, guide, and she knows his inner personality. In "Dynamo", the reader can also see a clear contrast. "Mrs. Light" is an upright lady, while "Mrs. Fife" is an indulgent woman. But she is sympathetic and kind, and even gives love to those who hate her. Because outward righteousness cannot make up for her inner cruelty and deception, "Mrs. Light" eventually forces her own son to seek comfort and happiness in "Mrs. Fife's" home. In "Lazarus Laughed", it is also that "Pompeia" has a noble spirit, she understands "Lazarus's" teachings, and is willing to die with him. In "Welded", we also see such a scene, the hero of the play, kneeling in front of the noble prostitute, vowing not to get up unless she can forgive his mistake of daring to approach her. Finally, he kisses her forehead and calls her "sister." Similarly, in "Anna Christie", Anna, after washing away her sins caused by the oppression of the environment from the waves of the sea, she is blamed by her inner self and does not want to deceive the rude sailor "Matt" who loves her and is loved by her. She finally told her and that sailor knew everything about her past, but he went away in anger. Her father "Chris Christopherson" had previously opposed her marrying the sailor, and had always insisted on opposing her love and her lover. After she also knew her past and the sailor ran away because of this matter, he wanted to ask the sailor to reconcile. In these places, I think O'Neill completely revealed the baseness, ridiculousness, and confinement to prejudice of men, so what he ridiculed was not these unfortunate women, but those vulgar men. Therefore, some people say that when a woman appears on the stage of O'Neill's play, the ratio of ten to one is that the woman is almost always sexually abnormal. If so, it can be guaranteed that that is the most outstanding role on the stage. This sentence almost says everything about the mysteries of O'Neill's plays.</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Prospects for China's Tung Oil Export Trade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Military Expenditures of the United States, Britain, Germany, and France in the Last Four Years</p>
<p>According to an article in the "Reconstruction Monthly," Volume 4, Issue 11, titled "World Economy in the First Half of 1936."</p>
<p>According to an article in the "Nation Building Monthly," Volume 6, titled "Current Stage of Great Power Arms Race."</p>
<p>The military industries of various countries generally focus on the manufacture of warships, aircraft, and armaments, all of which require large quantities of tung oil. Since 1933, military expenditures of various countries have shown an increasing trend. With the situation in Europe becoming increasingly tense, military expenditures of various countries will inevitably increase in the coming years. This gradual increase in military expenditures is sufficient to prove the growing development of military industries. As the military industries of various countries continue to increase, their demand for tung oil will also continue to increase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the world's construction industry, except for the United States, there are no verifiable figures for other countries. However, we are well aware that various countries have allocated large sums of money to implement public works projects in order to promote economic recovery and relieve unemployment. For example, the French parliament has designated 100,000,000,000 francs for public works construction expenses in recent years, of which 4,000,000,000 francs have already been used this year. In recent years, Germany has also invested heavily in this undertaking, as has Britain. According to a survey, the construction expenses approved by the U.S. government totaled 348 million U.S. dollars in 1934 and 597 million U.S. dollars in 1935. This year, there has been a further increase, with the total for the first five months of this year being significantly higher than the same period in the previous two years. By examining the table below, we can see the trend of the rapid increase in U.S. construction expenses. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>**Multiple Bull Positions Unleashed on a Large Scale, Cotton Yarn Suddenly Unsustainable, But New Bull Positions Emerge and Buy In**</p>
<p>Yarn prices fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, the trend showing a slight easing. After the sharp rise of the previous day, large quantities from Indian merchants and a certain major player poured out, reaching a massive 23,000 bales. Osaka Sanpin yarn also retreated. In the afternoon, a certain merchant at Changfeng &amp; Co. made efforts to buy in, and nearly all available yarn was snapped up, pushing prices back up again at closing. However, Sanpin yarn fell by 5.10 yuan, plummeting 2.50 yuan to 4.40 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>**Changfeng Still Buying in Large Quantities**</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn exchange market continued the previous day's tight trend, and buying was strong, with most people expecting prices to rise. However, Indian merchants and certain bull positions unleashed significant volumes, amounting to 20,000 bales over the previous two days. After the second session, it was reported that Osaka Sanpin yarn was uneven, and momentum eased. Transactions of spot yarn were sluggish. By closing, the market suddenly loosened, and prices plummeted, falling by 1.70 to 1.80 yuan across all months. As a result, prices for all months fell sharply, 1.60 to 1.70 yuan to 2.40 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing. The market continued to slump in the afternoon opening, as word came that Osaka Sanpin yarn fell another 2 yuan. The second session remained uneventful. Towards closing, a certain merchant at Changfeng &amp; Co. bought in large quantities. It was found that there were still 800-odd bales of spot yarn transactions. Prices for all months jumped by 1 yuan or more. As a result, prices for all months rebounded from a few cents to 1.40 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales: Chengji 1,800 bales, Juxing 1,300 bales, Yukang 1,100 bales, Jinchang 2,000 bales, Daqing 1,450 bales, Hexing 4,000 bales, Gengfeng 7,400 bales, Fengtai 1,300 bales, Shenji 1,600 bales, Runkang 1,100 bales, Xinhua 1,050 bales, Hengde 1,300 bales, Xiesheng 1,800 bales, Tonghe 1,000 bales, Jinkang 1,750 bales. Purchases: Deda 3,350 bales, Yuda 3,300 bales, Yiji 1,850 bales, Mingde 1,300 bales, Changji 1,250 bales, Ruida 1,650 bales, Yuanyi 3,850 bales, Dachangcheng 1,950 bales, Changfeng 1,150 bales, Yongchang 1,350 bales, Dachang 1,050 bales, Shengyuan 1,250 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>**Spot Yarn Trading 800-Odd Bales**</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were average. It was found that the various guilds purchased a total of 874 bales for the day. Selling prices trended lower, falling by 1 yuan or more. The purchase amounts by the various guilds are as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu　　　　Guangdong　300　Yunnan　120</p>
<p>Xuzhou　　0　Inland　225　Shantou　21</p>
<p>Jiangxi　25　Hankou　23　Counterparts　5</p>
<h3>Cotton</h3>
<p>**Cotton Weak in the Near Term - No Change in Distant Month Prices**</p>
<p>The cotton market has been weak recently, but distant month prices remain high. The market state is unusually calm, likely because the yarn market is firm and the Indian and American cotton markets fluctuate, rising and falling unpredictably, making them difficult to grasp. However, many parties are not willing to close their positions to narrow the wide price difference between yarn and cotton.</p>
<p>**Lack of New Buyers in the Exchange Market**</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton exchange market was slightly boosted by the upward trend in the American and Indian cotton markets, but there was still a lack of new buyers. After the second session, prices gradually declined. However, the Zhengzhu guild continued to absorb supply, so distant months remained firm. As a result, near months fell by 0.15 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Distant months remained unchanged. In the afternoon opening, near months rebounded by 0.20 yuan due to the sharp decline in the morning session. Distant months remained flat and weak. After the second session, there were still no significant ups and downs. Towards closing, the market was buoyed by the rise in yarn prices, rising by 0.15 yuan. As a result, near months rose by 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Distant months remained unchanged. Sales: Hengyi 8,400 dan, Yukang 2,600 dan, Jinchang 3,400 dan, Gengfeng 3,700 dan, Wang Taixing 1,800 dan, Yuanyi 1,400 dan, Changfeng 10,400 dan, Runkang 3,600, Fukang 4,710 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, Jinkang 2,100 dan. Purchases: Yizhenda 7,000 dan, Juxing 3,500 dan, Taixing 2,800 dan, Fengtai 3,800 dan, Taichang 7,700 dan, Hengchang 1,900 dan, Tonghe 1,600 dan, Xincheng 2,200 dan, Xinchang 6,200 dan, Changhe 4,100 dan, Shengyuan 3,000 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Trading Concentrated in December Contracts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened firmly, with all months rising by 3 to 6 points. Trading activity was high, with most of the activity involving the settlement of December bull positions. 62 delivery notices were issued. However, a major player among dealers had a strong need for December contracts. At the same time, cotton merchants were selling short, and dealers were buying in, with forces evenly matched. Some were also shifting December positions to distant months. Spot cotton prices were strong, and the cloth market was very high. At closing, dealers were buying in, and short positions were covered, pushing prices up. Spot prices rose by 12 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 12 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 5 to 6 points. Indian cotton exporters and manufacturers were also buying, and short positions were covered due to the firm rise in Japanese yarn prices. Pingguoer rose by 1 to 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is listed on the left (dated the 25th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 26th is as follows: Bailuoxi at 218.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; Aomula at 160.25 rupees, up 0.5 rupees; Pingguoer at 162.75 rupees, up 0.5 rupees.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn Prices Also Fell Sharply</h3>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>**Market Value Too High, Futures Flour Trading Instead Appears Listless**</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, in the morning opening, prices were initially stable for all months, followed by signs of loosening. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fluctuated by about a dime, Canada up a dime. Liverpool up nearly a penny, so at the open, buying interest reappeared, near months up a cent, distant months up two cents. Trading was still strong during the second session, and market sentiment was stable, but because customers were inactive and scattered bulls exited positions, distant months fell one cent. By the afternoon opening, the market suddenly softened due to the market value being too high. Customer sentiment instead seemed listless and most adopted a wait-and-see attitude unless absolutely necessary. This month's low reached 3.80 yuan, then rebounded 0.02 yuan on short covering. This month is the last day of trading, and given the circumstances, distant months won't rally too high.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Settled, Wheat Prices Ultimately Hard to Rise - Resulting in a Market Where Near Months Rose and Distant Months Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market in the morning opening, prices for all months showed a pattern of rising initially and then stabilizing slightly. In the morning sessions, market sentiment remained buoyant due to favorable foreign wheat prices, so at the open, prices for all months generally rose 0.02-0.03 yuan. This month is the last day of trading, the initial price was 6.09 yuan, then quickly fell 0.03 yuan as bulls unwound positions. By the afternoon opening, the market for all months instead looked flat and weak. Buyers of this month's contracts were mostly outsiders who had to liquidate their positions, so the low reached 0.03 yuan. Distant months also fell 0.03-0.04 yuan due to the decline in the flour market. Although the spot wheat market situation is difficult to see falling due to inventory levels, it is already higher than the price of rice, so it cannot stir up excitement. Spot wheat trading has been light recently. Factories in this city only tentatively procured about 3,000-odd bags, with the highest price reaching 6.10 yuan, down to 0.00 yuan. In addition, four Shaanxi factories continued to trade 30-odd tons at a price of 6.11 yuan.</p>
<h3>More Than 8,000 Bags of Bo Rice Sold, Market Appears Weak</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the various guilds received goods from more than a hundred sources, totaling over 11,000 shi, of which Bo rice accounted for seventy. Therefore, the Bo rice market saw a slight weakening of demand from buyers, with only 8,000-odd bags traded, and the situation became soft. Prices were lowered by 0.05 yuan. Sales of thick Geng rice in this street were lower than before, but the volume was only 1,200-1,300 bags, and it was supported by limited supply. Prices remained stable. Du Yangjian was similar, Yinbian Yuan was flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods arriving from various guilds downstream were strong, about 50-60 sources. Sales of all goods on the market were sluggish. New Geng rice prices fell slightly by 0.01-0.10 yuan. Sales of Bo rice were slightly sluggish. Retail sales in this street were weak, and prices were lowered by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Yangbu Kejian trading was dull, and prices were weak. Du Jian prices were down 0.03-0.05 yuan, Baiyuan was flat and weak, and the prices of other goods also softened.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Only Purchased by the Guangdong Guild</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice arrivals and sales were balanced, but the Guangdong guild's purchasing interest remained strong. Most of the rice traded yesterday was purchased by the Guangdong guild. The Shantou and Northern guilds only made minor purchases. Demand in this street was also weak. Only the Guangdong guild inquired about the rice throughout the day. Total transactions were only several thousand bags. Therefore, although arrivals have decreased recently, the market remains stable. Total transactions for the morning and afternoon were less than 10,000 bags, including 3,900 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,460 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 1,340 bags of Xiang Han rice. The situation was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>**Cloth Prices Too High, Leading to Wait-and-See Attitude, Prices of Four Mills Also Mostly Rose With Few Declines**</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw slightly softer yarn and cotton prices, and prices are now hovering. Cloth prices, however, remain firm due to limited spot supply on the market. Yesterday, prices of Eastern goods and fine cloths and fine twills from local mills continued to rise (per piece) by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan, but even at high prices, spot goods remained difficult to obtain. Straight-buy broadcloths and serges also successively rose (per piece) by about 0.10 yuan due to rising thread prices. However, the upward trend in grey fabrics was even greater, such as satin grey, bleached cloth grey, Western yarn grey, and poplin grey. Various dyeing factories are gradually placing orders in preparation for spring sales. Market prices are becoming too high, making it difficult to take action, so most large transactions must be delayed until the end of the Western calendar year. Yesterday, shipments from customer guilds remained strong, but most shipments were to the Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Yangtze River regions. Sales to the north were rarely improving. Shipments from the Guangdong, Yunnan, and Sichuan guilds were mainly serges, straight tribute, broadcloth, and fine twill, reaching more than 2,000 pieces. Hankou, Changsha, Datong, and Jiujiang also reported good sales.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the 3016th auction of the Yuanfang Foreign Firm in this city. Five types of goods were displayed: Western satin, velvet, straight tribute, wool, and foreign red cloth, totaling 48 brands and 69 boxes. Sales saw some activity from the Northern and Changsha guilds. Transactions in this street also showed improvement, with prices mostly rising and few declining compared to the previous auction. The opening bid for six brands of Western satin, "Nine English Flag Gold Day Picture," rose by 0.16 yuan per yard, "Four Headed Beast Lion Combined Monkey" rose by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. The remaining two brands had not been listed for a long time, so prices remained strong. Two brands of velvet, "Nine Fang Five Flower Cave," each rose by several cents. Straight tribute was flat. The "Phoenix" brand of wool rose sharply by 1 yuan per piece, "Colored Eight Scholars," "Three Dingjia," and "Yanguogong Sanyuan Di" each rose by half a yuan, "Monkey Deer Ascending High to Receive Fortune" all rose by 0.40 yuan or more. However, the "Flower Candle Celebration Year" brand fell by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, and the rest mostly rose by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, with many remaining flat. The foreign red cloth was a light weight, and there were no goods in the previous period. Now, dealers are competing to buy it, so prices are strong.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Cloth is in Season and Sales Are Strong</h3>
<p>Overcoat cloth sales have been extremely strong recently. There is demand for herringbone, cross-stitch, cloud patterns, etc. As the weather turns cold, Western-style overcoats are coming onto the market one after another. Black and gray solids are selling well. Pure wool black and gray overcoat cloth is particularly scarce, and prices have risen sharply.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>**Diaoqing Sugar from Production Areas Already Shows New Crop**</p>
<p>There was not much change in yesterday's sugar market. The guild's price was 21.55 yuan for second- and fourth-grade coarse granulated white spot, and 6.08 yuan for transshipment goods. Dutch red spot KD mark was 15.85 yuan, with some transactions slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. Eastern white spot No. 4 was 21.52 yuan, No. 8 was 21.20 yuan, and No. 9 YRO mark was 21.10 yuan. Transshipment goods No. 4 was 6.35 yuan, No. 8 was 6.10 yuan, and No. 9 was 5.95 yuan. Local mill refined white Zhenji No. 1 was 20.40 yuan, No. 2 was 20.00 yuan, No. 3 was 19.60 yuan, No. 4 was 19.20 yuan, and No. 5 was 18.80 yuan. Local mill No. 1 rock candy was 25.30 yuan, and No. 2 was 25.20 yuan. According to letters from Zhangzhou, the Diaoqing sugar produced there has already shown new crop, but because the output is still scarce, it is only enough to meet local needs. Yesterday, Hainan red, imported by Guangzhou steamer, continued to arrive in 812 bags. Wu Fu white rock candy and miscellaneous brand rock candy opened hundreds of boxes yesterday, all at the original price without change.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>**Tianjin Red Dates Market Expected to Improve Further**</p>
<p>Regarding Tianjin red dates, it was heard that customer goods continued to be shipped out. The top grade was 20 yuan, first-grade red was 15 yuan to 13.5 yuan, and second-grade red was 11 yuan to 10.5 yuan. According to letters from production areas, there is little hope of prices easing after the price increase. The market is expected to tighten further.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>**White Lead Sheet**</p>
<p>**Order Prices Already at £21 - The Greatest Increase Among Metal Products**</p>
<p>This year's white lead sheet market can be said to be unparalleled among all metals. Prices in Shanghai have risen steadily from around 100 yuan to 157-158 yuan. Recently, No. 5 patterned sheets have even opened at 160 yuan, a rare sight in the past five or six years. The reasons for the price increase are partly due to the strike in Belgium, which caused delays in shipping goods, and partly due to the strong domestic sales market, with insufficient arrivals to meet demand. This has undoubtedly greatly increased business, and selling prices have risen steadily. Overseas order prices have also risen from £17 5s to £20 15s. It is heard that deals were done at £21 yesterday, with the transaction volume said to be 200 barrels. Xin Kaihe Bang's metal shops have ordered, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>**Silk Exports Have Been Lower Than in Previous Years for Five Months - October Exports Were 4,322 Bales**</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Shanghai silk exports in October included 3,309 bales of white filature, 144 bales of Qili silk, a few bales of white native silk, 132 bales of yellow filature, 332 bales of yellow native silk, 209 bales of gray silk, and 97 bales of douppioni silk, totaling 4,322 bales. The total export volume from June to October this year was 18,320 bales, a decrease of 15,247 bales compared to the same period last year. This is partly due to the sparse trading activity in foreign firms in recent months. However, the market has recently shown signs of improvement, with brisk sales, and export volumes should increase. The table is attached below (unit: bales).</p>
<h3>Lu Zhuang Zhen Mei Trading Still Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw continued brisk purchases of Zhen Mei green tea from Lu Zhuang by British firms Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, and Yongxing. Total transactions in the city were over 700 boxes. The top price was 59 yuan, and except for native Zhuang goods, which were slightly firmer than before, the rest were stable. Needle, Xiu, and other items were still selling reasonably well to France, but inventories were low and supply could not meet demand. Many dealers have sent telegrams in response, announcing that broken tea is scarce, it is said.</p>
<h3>A True Success in the Treatment of Gonorrhea - A Guide Presented:</h3>
<p>**To Gonorrhea Patients Hesitating at the Crossroads**</p>
<p>- By Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The experimental report from the Nuremberg Venereal Disease Hospital fully proves the effectiveness of sensitization therapy. A thorough method for eliminating gonorrhea is advocated by governments worldwide, and those suffering from gonorrhea should be aware.</p>
<p>Fukuchi Ears says, "Only when you are sick can you truly understand the meaning and joy of health." Indeed, this statement is even more true for those suffering from gonorrhea. The pain of gonorrhea patients is probably only known to the patients themselves, aside from the clinicians.</p>
<p>Initially, when one contracts gonorrhea, greenish pus flows from the urethra. Frequent urination occurs, and urination is very painful, accompanied by mild itching, like insects biting. Some also have rotting glans, and some have swollen foreskins. At this time, in an urgent search for treatment, one takes some medication at random. If one happens to encounter a slightly purer drug, the pus discharge decreases after taking it, and the pain is less severe, leading one to believe that the medication is working, so treatment is discontinued. Taking inferior medicine, however, often poses a life-threatening risk.</p>
<p>Before gonorrhea is fundamentally cured, although the surface pain is relieved, the gonococcal toxin has already deeply infiltrated the blood. Sexual contact with a spouse will transmit the disease to the other party, leading to permanent infertility. When the wife contracts gonorrhea, there will be vaginal discharge, uterine rot, and even difficulty in moving. As for the man, the most obvious manifestation of chronic gonococcal toxin is swollen and hardened testicles, or cloudy and mixed urination, and the urine stream splits into two when urinating. There are also bladder inflammations that prevent urination, arthritis that cripples limbs, and prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis with semen like pig blood. Any of these conditions will prevent reproduction.</p>
<p>Therefore, those suffering from gonorrhea hope day and night for a practical treatment to emerge before they are cured. People with weak wills listen to the advertisements and rashly purchase and take gonorrhea medications, only to regret it later. In reality, there is absolutely no medicine that can be cured with one bottle or eradicated with two. Even the latest effective drug, "Kelinong," requires four to five bottles to be taken to eradicate the disease! Now, I honestly tell you that since the German gonorrhea authority invented the drug "Kelinong," gonorrhea patients have since found a correct treatment path.</p>
<p>Because "Kelinong" is a globally recognized effective drug for gonorrhea, it is a sensitized protein-pigment compound preparation. It is the first of its kind. After taking it, it can truly eradicate gonococcal toxins in the blood and fundamentally cure the disease without recurrence. According to reports from the Nuremberg Venereal Disease Hospital, 320 people took "Kelinong" in the past month, all of whom were cured, accounting for more than two-thirds of the patients.</p>
<h3>A Shorthand Sketch of a Sensual and Unparalleled Scene</h3>
<p>**The Prison of Sexuality**</p>
<p>- By Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Sailing along the Rhine, I saw a lush forest lined with clear waters. The scenery was beautiful, and the climate was mild. The place belonged to the small island of Liechtenstein. The people there regard men and women as absolutely equal, and the women are so beautiful. They fall in love openly, in the forest, by the river, young men and women dancing and singing. The gentle southern wind is intoxicating. Naturally, they revel like this, and sexual matters are very free. Anyone who has been to that small island, if they do not reject you, and stay there for some time, will be charmed by this sweet life and joyful enjoyment, throwing all past suffering to the winds. Therefore, some people say that this place often leads people to forget their homeland.</p>
<p>Due to the indulgence of sexual activity, the disease of sexual neurasthenia is also naturally very prevalent. But they do not have any fear. They know that taking the drug "Butikang" invented by Melun of Germany, this drug is absolutely effective for excessive indulgence in lust, masturbation damage to the seminal glands, etc., after taking it. Therefore, "Butikang" is very popular there. Everyone takes it, without any fear and indulging wildly.</p>
<p>Before the European War, that small island on the Rhine originally belonged to Germany and Italy. After the European War, it was designated as a neutral zone, otherwise it would still belong to Germany. Since the sensual news spread from that small island, doctors from various countries have also paid attention and conducted on-site investigations. When I was studying medicine at the Russian Labor University Medical School, I heard Professor Beisha say that the drug "Butikang" is indeed effective for sexual neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, etc. It can also promote the development of underdeveloped sexual organs. Only those with nocturnal emission can take it together with "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Pills" to suppress the seminal gates. This has the double benefit of achieving the best results. After graduating from that school, I used the drug "Butikang" to cure many young people of all sexual neurasthenia symptoms caused by masturbation and excessive lust. This drug is now widely used in our country, especially in urban areas.</p>
<h3>A Chronic Gonorrhea Still Under Treatment</h3>
<p>- By Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Shao Pinglan: Formerly lost his footing in the flower bush after drinking, after repeated treatment, the disease worsened, the urethra narrowed, urination was impossible, and it took several minutes each time. Later, it became more and more fierce. Even if he tried hard to urinate, he still could not excrete urine. Therefore, the urethra was catheterized with a rubber tube. The lower abdomen swelled, pulling and causing pain. His right testicle was also swollen and heavy due to gonorrhea toxins, making walking difficult. After scientific examination and surgery by me, the accumulated urine was cleared to prevent uremia. A urethral reflector and bladder reflector were also used for examination. The inner wall of the bladder was found to be inflamed and swollen, with several areas showing erosion (as shown in the figure below). This is a combined syndrome of bladder inflammation and epididymitis, and it must be treated comprehensively. I ordered him to use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" at home to wash inside the urethra to prevent the gonococcus in the urethra from gaining a foothold. I also ordered him to take "Kelinong" internally to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, and prevent corrosion. Intermittent electrical treatment was used. As of today, the bladder inflammation has subsided by eight or nine tenths, urination is smooth, but there is still a small amount of gonococcal strands. Therefore, treatment must be continued for one week before it can be completely cured. He is still under my treatment. I will report again after a confirmed cure.</p>
<p>This is a part of the inner wall of the bladder with inflammation and swelling. Now, after treatment with Kelinong, etc., the lesions have shrunk.</p>
<h3>Unignorable Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>- By Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Because every woman has the concept of "ten women, nine leukorrhea," they think that leukorrhea is not serious enough and arbitrarily ignore it without treatment. This is an extremely dangerous and blind act. The greater consequence is loss of life, and the lesser is damage to health. Menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea and infertility, and loss of health and beauty are also common in women with leukorrhea. The patient's vagina is often eroded and inflamed by leukorrhea, and intercourse and urination cause great pain. Therefore, the relationship between husband and wife is strained, and husbands often use this as a reason for divorce. As for leukorrhea caused by gonorrhea toxins, it is even more toxic and can kill sperm and eggs, causing infertility. The treatment method is to use "Kaeser's Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository to kill bacteria, prevent corrosion, and stop secretion, so that the leukorrhea can be washed away cleanly. Those who have leukorrhea caused by gonorrhea toxins can also take "Kelinong." Those who have weakness and menstrual irregularities can also take "Bunuyong," and the leukorrhea can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Lecture on Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation Hours): 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Routes of Transmission of Chronic Epididymitis</p>
<p>It is generally known that chronic gonorrhea is the result of neglected acute gonorrhea. However, the fact that gonorrhea can develop into epididymitis and then lead to infertility is often overlooked. The transmission route is through the urethra, rushing to the ejaculatory duct, then through the vas deferens, reaching the tail of the epididymis. The patient feels mild pain, but systemic symptoms do not change. However, gonococci and staphylococci can be detected in the prostatic secretions and urine. This type of epididymitis is prone to recurrence. Therefore, it is essential to eradicate it as early as possible. Once chronic epididymitis develops, gonococci destroy the testicular tissue, leading to the loss of sperm production function, which is a major cause of infertility. Clinical statistics show that epididymitis accounts for the absolute majority of infertility cases among gonorrhea patients. This is due to this reason.</p>
<p>However, there is still a chance to save the situation before bilateral epididymitis occurs, or before bilateral epididymitis reaches the point of no return. There was Mr. Tian Guoxiong from Wuchang Road, who, due to his job and environment, suffered from gonorrhea, which gradually developed into chronic epididymitis. Although he had been married for many years, he had not been able to have children. Later, his classmate, Mr. Miao Jingzhi, sent him a copy of my book, "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," and learned that I was skilled in treating gonorrhea. He hired a car and came to me for treatment. After a thorough examination using scientific methods, his right testicle was as large as a peach and showed a tendency to harden, and the left testicle was also affected, but not to the point of infertility. Therefore, in addition to using alternating short and longwave treatment, he also took "Kelinnong" internally to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, relieve pain, and promote urination. He also used "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" as an external medicine. After five weeks of treatment, he was completely cured. His testicles returned to normal, and his sperm production function was restored. Soon after, his wife stopped menstruating and became pregnant.</p>
<p>Attention Lung Tuberculosis and Weak Constitution</p>
<h3>The Most Economical Way to Achieve Rapid and Effective Treatment for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis know that their lungs are eroded by tubercle bacilli. They yearn for drugs that can directly kill tubercle bacilli to achieve a rapid cure for tuberculosis. Although this is a common desire, there is indeed no such preparation available. Most patients lack medical knowledge and are unaware of the internal pathological changes of tuberculosis. They dream of such a bactericidal therapy, spending a lot of money and countless time, but in the end, their condition worsens and they do not recover. Their tragic situation is heartbreaking. They do not realize the fundamental error in this concept, but instead blame tuberculosis for being incurable. This is truly pitiful!</p>
<p>We should not dream of any drugs that directly kill tubercle bacilli, nor can any organ therapy cure tuberculosis. Today, the most scientifically sound and rational treatment, from the patient's perspective, should be the latest preparation "Bufei Naer." The pharmacological basis of this drug is to reduce the tension of the lung lesions and slow down their respiratory movement. In this way, it can quickly increase the formation of calcium in the lungs and densely surround the bacteria. Reducing oxygen also causes the tubercle bacilli to lose vitality and gradually die. Therefore, after taking the medicine, symptoms such as hemoptysis, night sweats, expectoration, chest pain, and fatigue will be alleviated. If taken with "Buti Kang" or the female version "Bunu Rong," it can also cure neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, insomnia, and menstrual disorders in women.</p>
<h3>Female Diseases that Easily Damage Beauty</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of Tokyo Imperial University Medical School</p>
<p>For women who value beauty, the most vulnerable aspect is endocrine disorders. However, most women today, especially modern women, only know how to apply thick layers of foundation every day to win the favor of men. This local and temporary superficial cosmetic technique cannot ultimately hide a haggard face. Although applying foundation may win a man's favor for a moment, it is difficult to maintain it for long, and it is natural for her to fail in love.</p>
<p>However, this outdated cosmetic technique cannot compete with fundamental cosmetic techniques. A woman with underdeveloped breasts, flat chest, thin hips, and a sallow complexion, if she takes "Bunu Rong" invented by the German Meren, it can promote the endocrine function of the ovaries and accelerate metabolism. The blood circulation becomes vigorous. Therefore, she will have a healthy whole-body development, high breasts, revealed curves, and rosy and plump cheeks, full muscles, delicate skin, and lively spirit. Her eyes will be flowing and charming, which can be called a standard beauty. This is the foundation of female happiness, and this kind of beauty cannot be transformed with foundation. In addition, symptoms such as menstrual pain and long-term infertility can naturally be eliminated. The endocrine preparation "Bunu Rong" has become a treasure for women with diseases because it can transform female beauty and give women happiness. For those with leucorrhea, "Ka'er Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories.</p>
<h3>Winter Tonic</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo</p>
<p>Notes on Tonifying Medicine</p>
<p>Lower animals, such as insects and shellfish, must hibernate in winter to prepare for the coming spring. Although humans are higher animals, they still cannot avoid the laws of nature. In terms of the human body, winter is a time of dormancy, and the nutrients absorbed by the body are stored in the liver for use in the coming spring and throughout the year. The old custom of Chinese people taking tonic medicine in winter is consistent with scientific principles.</p>
<p>However, when taking tonic medicine in winter, it is important to choose carefully. It is necessary to invigorate the vitality of the whole body cells, and it is not effective to only nourish a certain organ or strengthen yang. In my experience, "Buti Kang" has the most powerful tonic effect. This medicine can supplement the body with hormones and cells, and it has the overall effect of nourishing the brain, essence, and kidneys.</p>
<p>Reader's Forum</p>
<p>The following medicines are all specified by doctors who graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Please make sure to recognize the names of each medicine when purchasing! Do not buy miscellaneous inferior medicines due to the words of others, so as not to endanger yourself by taking them by mistake.</p>
<p>Stomach Problems and Weakness</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Zhaoding from Yin County wrote: "I have been suffering from stomach problems for many years, with a poor appetite. Every time I attend a banquet, I stop eating and do not lift my chopsticks. After meals, I have acid reflux, belching, chest tightness, and pain, and my bowel movements are often dry and constipated. Fortunately, last month, I was introduced by a friend to buy and take two boxes of German 'Qiangwei Jing,' which had a good effect. I then took another two boxes, and the stomach bloating and pain disappeared suddenly. My body is also strong!"</p>
<p>Treatment of Gonorrheal Discharge</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yonghua from North Zhejiang Road wrote: "I accidentally contracted gonorrheal discharge, with difficulty urinating, unclear urine, and indescribable pain in the penis. The urethral opening was blocked with pus, and the glans was red and swollen. I had taken many kinds of gonorrhea medicine, but none of them worked. I bought and took 'Kelinnong' and also bought 'Anti-Gonorrhea Water' from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company and washed the area locally according to the instructions. It had a miraculous effect. My urine became clear, and all the pain disappeared. I only know that the 'Anti-Gonorrhea Water' is prepared properly, without any irritation. Even ordinary people with urethral diseases or women with leucorrhea can use it externally according to the method to wash the area locally, without any harm."</p>
<p>Persistent Cough</p>
<p>Yao Xi Jun: "Taking 'Bufei Naer' for persistent cough and excessive phlegm is indeed very effective."</p>

<h3>Self-Treatment for Sexual Weakness Caused by Spermatorrhea and Nocturnal Emission: Long-Term Infertility</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Bronneton wrote in his suicide note: "I have sacrificed everything for sexual love, but in this regard, I am incompetent. I have a natural masculine function, but I cannot exert the power to overcome the opposite sex. My wife left me because she could not get the satisfaction of life."</p>
<p>Reading this sad text makes us aware of the pain of those with sexual weakness. Young people in adolescence, seduced by pornographic books or bad friends, inevitably indulge in masturbation. Ejaculating through masturbation causes even greater damage to the vas deferens, causing it to lose control, leading to spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, and premature ejaculation. Some people who have too much sexual intercourse and overuse their sexual organs may also experience spermatorrhea. This is the first step towards sexual weakness, and it will soon become impotence. These symptoms are all causes of infertility.</p>
<p>To cure spermatorrhea and sexual weakness, it is not enough to nourish the gonads. It is necessary to supplement a large amount of semen to strengthen sexual power. Based on this principle, the great physiologist Meren extracted the testicles and sperm of brave animals such as gorillas, lions, tigers, and seals to make "Buti Kang," a kidney tonic. Taking it can supplement a large amount of semen, making sexual power strong and vigorous. It is the key medicine among tonic seeds. If spermatorrhea has been going on for a long time, "Naier Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" can be taken at the same time for rapid results!</p>

<h3>Negotiations and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Former International Court of Justice Judge Dr. Wang Chonghui met with a reporter from a certain newspaper at his residence in Shanghai yesterday morning and made a statement on national affairs: (1) He did not make a definite statement on the issue of stopping negotiations; (2) Regarding the Suiyuan incident, he said that it could be appealed to the League of Nations, but whether there would be any result is still questionable, but the League of Nations is currently engaged in revising the Covenant and is trying to extricate itself, hoping to restore its former prestige. This is just diplomatic rhetoric, but it is what my government and diplomats have to say. Diplomats have never been in the habit of saying definite things, so I fully agree with what a certain Japanese officer said: "Our troops participated in the Suiyuan affair, and the weapons were supplied by our country." How frank and straightforward his words are.</p>
<p>As for the issue of stopping negotiations, it goes without saying that they should be stopped, because the Suiyuan affair is also an important point in the negotiations. Now that things have gotten so bad, what else is there to say? But there are also two ways to stop negotiations: one is to formally announce the cessation of negotiations, and the other is to stop negotiations invisibly. Because in the current Suiyuan affair, the Japanese authorities still believe that it is a disturbance by our country's bandits and has nothing to do with Japan, but what is the truth? It is clear to everyone, so there is no need to say more. It is best to just make the best of a bad situation, to deal with the facts as they are presented.</p>
<p>As for appealing to the League of Nations, I don't think it's necessary. Although Dr. Wang also knows the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations, he is not hoping for the present, but hoping for the future. He should walk from the corner of the felt blanket and take a wide turn. From the perspective of my country's position in the international community, appealing to the League of Nations is also a work that should be done. Whether it was the September 18th Incident or the Abyssinian War, we burned incense and kowtowed to the League of Nations, sincerely seeking help, but it was all in vain. But now the hope is not in the current League of Nations, but in the future League of Nations, at least hoping that it will say a few nice words. This sounds reasonable, but given the current situation in Europe, with fascism and non-fascism forming two extremes, it will not be easy to reform the League of Nations. Even if it is possible, it will not have any impact on our country.</p>
<p>Today, I am going to reveal the secret: any country puts its own interests first and will never prioritize the interests of others. It will never help others for no reason, nor will it make enemies for no reason. (1) If they have a vital relationship with a certain country, then when that country is in an emergency, they will naturally step forward and fight for justice. If there is no relationship at all, even if they kowtow like pounding garlic, it will be of no avail. (2) Even if they have a vital relationship, but their own capabilities are weak, they will never be willing to rescue people from the well. They will not stand idly by to reap the benefits of the fisherman, but at least they will be smart enough not to suffer immediate losses. Therefore, I dare say that the current League of Nations is useless, and the future League of Nations will not be useful either.</p>
<p>Look at what kind of world it is today! Any parliament, any alliance, any charter, any law is just waste paper, useless. All that is useful is airplanes, cannons, and tanks.</p>
<h3>Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>An opera troupe came to town.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Sifu went to the city to carry manure and saw them coming down from the city.</p>
<p>As soon as this troupe arrived, they took a fancy to the Chen family's wasteland. They erected a rather large cloth awning, and outside the awning, about two feet away, they built a rope enclosure. The Chen family's wasteland, which had seemed very large before, now seemed a little smaller.</p>
<p>Several girls in the troupe, dressed very flirtatiously, swaggered around the streets. Those young lads who were always looking for trouble put on duck-tongue caps they had just bought from the city, and some even wore new cloth shoes of the original color, following behind them and shouting.</p>
<p>Passing by the Yuxing Tea House, they turned in and asked the blind Eryi, the owner, for two pots of black tea.</p>
<p>"Miss, are you from the city?" Blind Eryi said with a smile as he wiped the table.</p>
<p>"Um!" the oldest one said indifferently.</p>
<p>"When will the show start?"</p>
<p>"In the afternoon."</p>
<p>Blind Eryi filled their tea and stood by the table, not leaving. Eryi's wife, who was working the bellows, glared at him, but he didn't see it and kept smiling at them.</p>
<p>"How many copper coins to buy a ticket?"</p>
<p>"Eight!"</p>
<p>"Um, that's quite cheap. What kind of show are you performing? Is it Peking opera?"</p>
<p>"No, it's a new play!" The youngest one, who was also the prettiest, wearing a red floral calico cheongsam, took a sip of tea.</p>
<p>"New play... um! Is it a modern drama? A newly popular play in the city..."</p>
<p>"Blind man! Make tea!"</p>
<p>Eryi's wife pulled Erniu over and pointed to the Second Master who had just entered the door.</p>
<p>"Make tea, make tea! He wants to eat 'white tea' and wants to make you happy! Flirt!" Erniu's wife dragged Eryi away. Seeing the patron who had come in, the Second Master, who was used to eating "white tea," he was so angry that he spat on Erniu's wife's face.</p>
<p>They sat for a while and were about to leave.</p>
<p>"Boss, how much for two pots of tea?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter, what's the matter!" Blind Eryi kept pushing the money away.</p>
<p>"How can you eat 'white tea'? How much is it, boss!"</p>
<p>"It's a small matter, sixteen coppers in total, forget it, forget it."</p>
<p>This made Eryi's wife very anxious. She quickly stood up from the fire stool, walked behind Blind Eryi, and twisted his leg hard. Blind Eryi reluctantly saw them to the door. As they left, they said to the boss: "Come and join us in the afternoon!"</p>
<p>"Flirts, shameless, unwanted trash!" Eryi's wife waited until they were far away before cursing with all her might.</p>
<p>It was said that the show would start at two o'clock, but by one o'clock, it was already full.</p>
<p>Blind Eryi was one of the most enthusiastic. Whenever he met an acquaintance, he would always brag: "They were drinking tea at my store this morning!"</p>
<p>"Oh, drinking tea at your store?" the other person said incredulously.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Who's lying to you? The one wearing the red calico, she even..."</p>
<p>"Stop talking, stop bragging!"</p>
<p>"Really..." He blushed and couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Pretend it's true, look, you're welcome, smiled and walked away."</p>
<p>The show started, first with a few men doing martial arts, which wasn't what they wanted to see, and besides, it wasn't very good, one of them couldn't even catch a flying kick. This was met with boos and shouts, and they ran away.</p>
<p>The second act was "Teasing Liu Shi," which aroused the interest of the whole audience.</p>
<p>"Good!" Before the actress even came out, Blind Eryi was already cheering.</p>
<p>The one playing Liu Shi was the girl with the small round face wearing the red floral calico.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that the jacket is a bit too big," said one with a pointy face.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? If it were tighter, that pair of little apples... haha." The big guy next to him winked.</p>
<p>The play was coming to the last scene, "Teasing Liu Shi Riding a Wooden Mule Around the Four Gates." At this time, the owner of the troupe started to make a "speech." He first clasped his fists and said,</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to hear any songs, you can order them. Teasing Liu Shi is a bad person, we want to beat her. Look! Beat her like this! The harder the better!"</p>
<p>He took out a handful of copper coins from his pocket and threw them at the small round-faced Liu Shi. Then, he clasped his fists again and retreated.</p>
<p>"Eighteen Touches!" Blind Eryi was the first to shout, took out two copper coins, flew them up, and threw them on her buttocks, and they bounced off.</p>
<p>"Good!" Some people were reaching into their pockets for copper coins.</p>
<p>The one on the stage smiled and started singing.</p>
<p>Both hands...</p>
<p>Older sister's...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The men threw coins at her, some hitting her face; some hitting her buttocks... The women took out a copper coin from their pockets, looked at it, and put it back in. Instead, they picked up some small stones from the ground and threw them up. Two old women turned their faces away and threw hard.</p>
<p>The copper coins and stones hit her like snowflakes. A small stone hit her forehead, and it swelled up. Her shinbone also took a hit. She just covered herself with her hands, still smiling and singing "Eighteen Touches."</p>
<p>Another hit on the nose, and she bled. She couldn't take it anymore and ran inside. The troupe owner came out again and gave a "speech," apologized, and then the show ended.</p>
<p>The next day, the opera troupe was gone.</p>
<p>Sifu came back from carrying manure from the city and said: They went to the city, and the little girl who played Teasing Liu Shi had many cloths tied on her face.</p>
<p>"Flirt! Serves her right! She still hasn't torn off that smelly thing!" Eryi's wife worked the bellows even harder.</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying "Yu Qing Ting"</p>
<p>China and the West (1040) from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Romance of the West Chamber"</p>
<p>A scholar's favor is worth half a sheet of paper. One tael of silver for the meditation hall. Most like the land of the Three Treasures. Meditate and listen to the Diamond Sutra. Cuckoos sing lonely by the ear. Even more desolate in a foreign inn. This is, the breeze and bright moon are unattended. Rest and stay in the West Chamber. Sit idly in the small pavilion and contemplate the Book of Changes. Open the book by the firefly window and read the articles. A pair of monks and laymen talking loudly. A maid in green clothes walks out. Following the orders of Lady Cui. Especially set up a meditation hall. For the late Prime Minister's death anniversary. Please monks to pray for him to go to the West. Worship the Dharma King on the 15th good day. After saying that, leave a step. It is because the infatuated powder lang. Zhang Sheng goes up and bows deeply. Sister is, could it be Miss Yingying's maid Hong Niang. I am, Zhang Junrui, a talented scholar from Luoyang. Work in the monastery as a study for marriage. Trouble reporting to the Ruzhu Palace. It is said that there is no wife at home yet. Hong Niang listens. Changes face. The master's words are too absurd. It is said from ancient times that it is not polite to speak. Book reading gentlemen love to be light on. The old lady holds the frost festival. Three-foot children are not allowed to enter the main hall. It is excusable to hear what the maid said. If the lady knows, she will hate it very much. From now on, think carefully before speaking.</p>
<p>He Yunfang and He Qinfang "Double Pearl Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Song Jiang"</p>
<p>Liangshan bandit Song Gongming. Gathered wandering dead men. Even to the point of, robbing warehouses and killing officials and soldiers. Robbing homes and villages. Moreover, those thirty-six hooligans. Shandong and Hebei dare to be tyrannical. It is a deceptive language to act on behalf of heaven. Let's wait for the court to recruit them. The hearts of the people. But I met. The official soldiers captured the thieves without success. Only because, the crowd is scattered and impermanent is not easy to find. At that time, the two emperors Zheng and Qin were immoral. Use this class, Tong Guan Gao Qiu and Cai Jing. The whole court belongs to the powerful ministers. The hearts of the people are disaffected everywhere. And rise up the heroes to steal and play with soldiers. Although jumping beams are all villains. War fires rise everywhere lacking mediation. The people are poor and the wealth is exhausted without food. The bandits are a little not serious. Fortunately, the commander met Zhang Shuye. He was originally, intelligent and resourceful with six tactics and three strategies. Could be able to, wipe out all in one night. In the end, the whole book was written as Water Margin. Nai An Shi Lao's wonderful talent. Realize the heaven and earth star from nothing. Think out of the box is really cute. Put together one hundred and eight people. Wonderful but, the bandits end up returning to Duan Jingzhu. And there is that, timely good rain to send Jiangxin. The implication is very subtle and has a reason. Several ten thousand coins were once hung for the reward. Therefore, paper cards are used to win or lose by this. But I do not know, who shot the long bow and short arrows. Suspected fake and true Zhang shape. The end of Liangshan woke up in a dream.</p>
<p>Jiang Bin Chu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Voice (1380) from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Three Smiles Plays a Woman"</p>
<p>Handsome and suave Zhou beauty. Talented and beautiful appearance surpass the crowd. Drink with Zhi Shan and talk about the heart. Mentioning a childhood memory. My sister's appearance is exactly like me. It's a pity that she died early. Gao Tang misses his daughter sick in bed. Relying on the virtuous sister-in-law in the boudoir. Taking brother as good mediation. Half a year of suffering one day is light. Yunming heard slightly laugh. How can a man play a woman. Isn't there any flaws to find. Negative Zhou Lang refuses to accept. The two bet to determine the winner or loser. Said back to the inner hall. To the east building sister-in-law talked together. The bride refuses to be annoyed. Mo Nai He had to go downstairs. Suddenly met Gui Fang, a little maid. Ordered him to change clothes and skirts. The flitting speed is indistinguishable. The body is pretty and graceful. Wangyue Pavilion first saw the face of the mother. Want to try the old eyes of Xuantang. Sure enough, concealed the twilight man. Just like the old Laizi back then. Wearing colored clothes and playing Le Tian Lun. Present laughter in the game.</p>

<p>Remaining Sounds</p>
<p>Respectfully, the program of our troupe published in your newspaper on the 25th is quite inconsistent with the original manuscript submitted by our troupe. Our troupe has always regarded strict compliance with the regulations of the Telecommunications Bureau as our duty, which has long been recognized by all circles. Such actions are obviously the intention of petty people to sabotage. In addition to thorough investigation, we hereby send a special letter to your office, hoping that you will publish our letter to clarify the truth, to facilitate your work. (Respectfully to the Mr. Editor of Remaining Sounds of Shen Bao, from the Roaring Song Troupe (November 26))</p>
<p>Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) Today from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM, please listen to Mr. Li Si-Jing of Great China University give a lecture on "The Education of Urban Citizens." From 5:15 PM to 5:30 PM, please listen to Mr. Wang Yu-Kai, Director of Group Education at Great China University, speak on "Problems of Civic Training." At that time, we hope all circles will pay attention and listen in.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>"Shanghai" Screens "Loyalty to the Country"</h3>
<p>In addition to "The Circus" and others, "Loyalty to the Country" is already the sixth new Soviet film to be released at the Shanghai Grand Theater this autumn.</p>
<p>"Loyalty to the Country" explains that citizens should not only be loyal to the country and sacrifice for the country on the battlefield, but also strive loyally in their careers and think of the country in everything.</p>
<p>"Loyalty to the Country" is not an ordinary adventure film, but an artistic film, and it is also different from "Ice and Snow Land". It is more artistic.</p>
<p>The most spectacular part is the natural scenery of Central Asia, the steep mountains of the Pamir Plateau, the life of the natives of Asia Minor, and the war between the Red and White armies.</p>
<p>The last sentence of the dialogue in the film can well illustrate the theme of this film:</p>
<p>"When the blood in our chests is not cold, no one can resist us, and the endless deserts and steep mountains cannot stop us."</p>
<h3>The Special Contribution of "Guangling Tide"</h3>
<p>"Guangling Tide" is one of the films for which Yi Hua Company has made the greatest sacrifice this year, and it will be shown simultaneously at the New Guang and Carlton theaters within days. The script is adapted from the posthumous work "Guangling Tide" by Mr. Li Han-Qiu. The wonderful plot is well known to those who have read the novel "Guangling Tide", and the superb acting techniques, the advanced acting skills of the actors, and the magnificent sets all make the domestic film shine with a different brilliance. Later, the revolutionary movement was added to create a hot and tense atmosphere, resulting in this perfect masterpiece.</p>
<h3>"Sai Jinhua" Continues for One Day</h3>
<p>Half of the proceeds will be donated to support Suiyuan. The premiere of "United Hearts in Life and Death" is postponed.</p>
<p>The premiere of the new Mingxing film "United Hearts in Life and Death" was originally scheduled to begin today at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and a screening was invited for all circles this morning. Now, because the 40s Drama Club and Jincheng have jointly decided to continue performing "Sai Jinhua" for one day today, with half of the total revenue donated to the Suiyuan anti-Japanese soldiers, the premiere of "United Hearts in Life and Death" will be postponed, and the date of the screening will also be announced separately. Those who have received Mingxing "United Hearts in Life and Death" screening tickets need not bother to attend.</p>
<h3>"Four Beauties", a Joint Production Starring Four Major Actresses, Opens Today</h3>
<p>Janet Gaynor, Loretta Young, Constance Bennett, and Simone Simon are all leading ladies in Hollywood. Now, 20th Century Fox is sacrificing to bring together these four actresses to jointly star in "Ladies in Love", which cannot be said to be a miracle in the film industry this year. The story tells of four young girls who lead a monotonous and lonely life, so they inevitably embark on the path of seeking love, each pursuing a satisfactory husband. Janet works as a helper for a young doctor. Loretta falls in love with a young aristocrat, but later hears that he is going to marry another girl, and is so angry that she tries to commit suicide by taking poison. Constance is a luxury-loving girl who is deeply involved with an engineer, but happens to meet Simone, who also takes a fancy to him, so a conflict occurs. The whole film describes the issue of love between the sexes in a very thorough and profound way, with both humor and sadness. The film is scheduled to be released at the Grand Theater today. Movie fans should not miss it.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Company Seeks Materials from Movie Fans</h3>
<p>We deeply feel that we do not have free time to contact various people in society, nor can we see the various rights and wrongs in society, so we cannot widely adopt materials to write scripts. However, we believe that there are many dark events in society, many people who have grievances but have nowhere to turn, and many people who speak out for justice and are wise and insightful. Therefore, we are publicly soliciting. No matter what class of people you are, whether you have complaints in your heart, or a lifetime of ups and downs, or discover any secrets of institutions, families, or individuals, or any difficult problems to solve, or any suggestions for society and the country, you can write them out. Regardless of whether the writing is fluent or not, regardless of the number of words, please send them directly to the "Material Acquisition Department" of Xinhua Film Company, No. 2567 Xietu Road, Shanghai. If they are found to be suitable after review, they will be used to write scripts, and the name of the person who provided the village will be introduced in the film credits to commend them.</p>
