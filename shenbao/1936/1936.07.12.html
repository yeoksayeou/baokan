<p>國聯已經决定於十五日取消對意制裁了擾攘多時的意阿問題就這樣地輕輕告了一個結束我們還記得去年十月國聯大會的席上五十個會員國會一致理直氣壯的决議對意大利違犯盟約十二條的行動實施制裁跟着國聯就組織一種特別委員會以監督各會員國對意制裁的執行不料時隔九月意大利吞併了阿比西尼亞之後國聯非但不能保障會員國領土完整的盟約規定竟連這僅有的制裁的名義也撤銷了</p>
<p>自「九一八」事變以來國聯盟約久已等於具文因此去年國聯發動對意經濟制裁一般人都覺得這眞是「差强人意」的舉指可是制裁實施之後因爲奧匈阿爾巴尼亞三國設有加入法賴伐爾內閣想挾意以制德又不肯認眞執行制裁力量本已大爲减弱到了最近墨紫里尼吞併了阿比西尼亞趾高氣揚時時以聯德相戚脅以撤銷制裁爲重返國聯的條件同時英國鑒於近東危機的加甚爲緩和地中海緊張的局面起見深覺非拉攏意國不可它寗願實行對意妥恊而以大部分力量應付這些「討厭」的問題因此决心倡議撤銷對意制裁法人民內閣則惟恐意德結合不敢跟意結仇也就贊成了英國的倡議在這樣關係的牽制之下國聯終於不免犧牲自己的威信犧牲阿比西尼亞撤銷制裁以討好侵略者了</p>

<h3 id="c61">動盪中的西班牙 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>西班牙的農民是半封建的地主制度的犧牲者，在西班牙，至今存在着無數封建主義的和封建心理的殘餘。農業的技術是跟沙俄時代一樣的陳腐，而生產的標準也極低下。利潤是很少有再投資的；地主對於他們自己的將來沒有信心。西班牙的苦惱是在懶惰的富人和懶惰的窮人。我曾去訪問一個兼任當地地主恊會高級職員的地主。當他在咖啡館中對我談話時，他的頭注視着別處，在我們討論的最初十五分鐘，我小心翼翼的提防着他。他覺得自己的階級是前進的。他說，「我深信農業除了灌漑以外是沒有方法改進的」（換句話說，這與地主毫無關係）「在沒有社會主義宜傳之前，農夫們雖然覺得不滿，但郤快快樂樂的過着日子。農人們是生就在田間的，而且習慣了艱苦的工作。他雖然覺得工資不够，郤不知什麼生活的改善。工資誠然凄慘，但現在實沒有增加的可能。自從一九三一年起，（自從共和國成立後）因為工資的抬高和物價的跌落，農業已無利可圖。我們深受着生產過剩的痛苦」（許多西班牙人郤在餓死。）</p>
<p>「依據了人類實際的意志」，他自動地說，「那西班牙的間題是極易解决的」。我請求他說得再具體些，可是他只多舉了幾個名詞而止。叉有一個擁有五萬頃田地的阿達內羅伯爵夫人（Countcss　of　Adanero）財產的管理者，也說了這同樣的意向。</p>
<p>那握取百分之八十人口的生活的西班牙地主階級，决不會解决土地間題，（但這是西班牙較主要的問題），因為這是它所不能解决的。因為農民沒有購買力。所以各種的工業便也無從發展了。西班牙這種什麼都缺乏，只就都市的失業者，已達七〇〇·〇〇〇之多了。人民只有很微的金錢，很微的消費力，因而國民經濟也自然只有衰微的一途。</p>
<p>阿柴那怎樣應付這樣情勢呢？他承認這是一個急待救濟的嚴重問題。至今日止，他已做到了這點：强迫地主把田地租借給“Yunters,在情形最惡劣的克塞景斯省中，土地改良委員會的代表孚德（Senor　de　la　Fuente）曾於三月七日發表了一種聲明書，要求地主租賃田地給“Yunteros”但是誰也沒有答覆和妥協的意思。於是農民提出了「哀的美敦書」；「如果你們不給我們田地，我們要在四十八小時內佔據它了！」三月十二日，Yunteros在大田產上建立的農耕區於是開始。從此後，克塞景斯的二四·七〇二的Yunteros租得了六九·六一二公頃的田地。但這些田地並不是充公或收買的，那Yunteros　只成了半收穫的一份子而已。在這稀乾燥的農耕區中，必須有三十到三十五頃的田地纔能維持一個家庭，而Yunteros現在所得到的每家平均的三頃。有幾個從前稍稍擁有一些田地的，但是這種人很少，而且奮地和新地往往隔離着的，有幾個Yunteros每天要騎在騾背上五小時才能到耕耘地方去。在巴達荷斯（Badajog)，那土地改良委員會竭力推行第二個省區，農民三月二十五日的晚上乾脆地佔據了田地，自動地耕耘着，並且要求委員會承認他們的行動為合法—結果是做到了。這裏的“Yunteros”現在也可租賃田地了。四萬五千個巴逮荷斯的Yunteros，被允許了一萬二千公頃，每人平均不足三公頃。土地改良在到處或多或少地推行着，而且，還將繼續着。阿柴那曾經對我說；「當五十萬的農民獲得土地時，這問題便可解决了」。阿柴那叉說他希望在數年前已經停止的法律之下，無代價的沒收大地主的田產。他還將允許恢復村莊地的集體估有，在十年以前，這些村莊曾經作過集體牧塲的。</p>
<p>西班牙的農民是否最後享有了他不充分的土地，誰也不敢說。農業部長魯資芬慈（Ruiz-Funeg)對我說，「這是一個困難的問題」。一些也不錯。但這必有解决的一天，時候愈遲，困難愈多罷了。在目前，那Yunteros依然是貧苦的半收穫者。阿柴那在我的訪問中會說土地改良，必將加强都市的布爾喬亞的力量，但他毫不介意這點，因為布爾喬亞並不是反共和黨的。但因土地改良究竟是吾能够獲利呢？也許當土地改良完成時，農民可以略略沾利。但這只能說他們可稍稍得些滋補。這並不是說他就可成為都市貨物的活躍消費者，這是必然的。土地改良應當視為繁樂西班牙都市和振興新工業的一種方法嗎？要做到這點，阿柴那的計畫太狹隘了。</p>
<p>阿柴那一個僚屬對我說，土地改良可以减弱社會主義黨的力量。道也許會過壓了革命的熱誠。在二千基羅米突汽車旅程上對我的談話中，那二十個Yunteros明白地表示他們對於土地改良的滿意：雖然他們也覺得這於他們依然是無望而不適宜。西班牙農民的凄慘是可以想見了，僅只這些對他們最起碼的注意和援助，已使他們感恩匪淺了。</p>
<p>因此，阿柴那的土地改良也許救得阿柴那個人的，然而他又是一個不能僅以此滿足的巨人。他的土地改良救不了西班牙。現在西班牙的反抗運動正在實踐一個階級欐取政權的諾言，使這個階級在西班牙的成就同布爾喬亞在別的國家所做一樣—然後再發展到較高的階段，可是土地改良却以對鄕村不安的部分安慰，削弱了這種抗議運動的力量，事之可悲，蓋在於此。如果農民以目前的土地改良為滿足，西班牙所需要的解决方法的實施，必將在政治上减弱推進力了。</p>
<p>這裏便引起了有趣的一點：阿柴那的改良同時也削弱了地主階級。他們被剝奪了對其田產有效的管制。（除非恢復了原有的反動政治）。假定這種情形繼續着。假定，過了三二年後，農民們對阿柴那的溫和政策感到了多减。假定他們提出了全部財產充公和集體化的最後要求，西班牙的布爾喬亞是吾有反抗的力量呢？也許西班牙可以民主地來一决經濟革命而不發生內戰。我却不知道。</p>
<p>同時，農業集體化的傾向成長着。我參觀了兩個集體農村。此外還有許多—都是由農民們自動組織的他們並不知道蘇維埃的集體農塲（Kolkozi）。孚德和蒙妥荷（Jorge　Montojo）卡塞累斯和巴達荷斯土地改良的分別負責者都感覺到他們機構的不當。他們都鑒到廣播全西班牙的集體化的聰明，特別是燥耕。西班牙的法令限制了機械在農業上的運用。大量的利用機械的燥耕必將使西班牙的鄉村換了一付新面目。地主却不願運用它。農民個人力所不及。集體化實是最合邏輯的方法。「但是西班牙的農民是個人主義者」，魯資芬慈强辯說。我曾經從許多方面聽到過這種言論。我不信非常的貧窮是與個人主義相適合的。那忍受了數十年窮苦的個人主義者是必然同意於能使他富饒的集體制度的。</p>
<p>卡白拉魯（Lurgo　Caba　lero），左翼社會主義黨最受擁護的領袖—農民大都是左翼社會主義者—對我說，他不信阿柴那能够實行集體化。共產黨也抱着同樣的見解。他們恐懼着政治情勢因保守的勒樂和反動的盧卜爾斯向阿柴那的左翼共和黨的進攻，也許又會轉向右而去。阿柴那是吾將為其黨徒所毀滅呢？如果是的，那時如果羣衆再反對他的政策，給反動派造成抬頭機會的危機也許要發生了。或者羣衆將擁護共產黨和卡白拉魯（他對我說與共產黨是無甚區別的）繼續阿柴那失敗的事業，但除非右派來一次政變，這種情形馬上是不能發生的。所調「馬上」意思就是至少一年。</p>

<p>南洋素稱富庶、而僑胞人數、有五百五十餘萬之多、誠一大好之市塲、然國貨之輪入尙少、殊不足以供僑胞消費、近年國內工業界對南洋市塲亦十分重視、此次本團之組織、在宣傳國貨之現狀、使南洋僑胞、對祖國工業之孟晉成績得一充分之認識、而種一好的影響、同時亦為國貨工業在南洋各地闢一市塲基礎、以解决國貨界當前之嚴重問題、然南洋市塲、鄰邦時有種種考察團的考察、其意在積極實行南進政策、樹立其在南洋之經濟勢力、故本團此行、除作商業之考察外、並備有完備之各業出品樣品、贈送各地僑胞、數量有三百餘箱、且與當地商會僑胞組織一國貨展覽會、會後則設一陳列館陳列各種國貨出品、年來中國與南洋之貿易數字甚屬稀少、而市塲上鄰邦、正在積極增拓勢力、本團此去之任務、自屬艱重、但本團在政府指導及工廠界之熱忱與各地僑胞盛意歡迎之下、願竭盡其力、為國貨界作一先鋒、尙祈各界予以指敎、使完成此行之使命、切盼切盼云云、</p>

<p>因白銀交中央保管難以辦到</p>
<p>唐壽民貝决定中止南行</p>
<p>中央政府爲謀統一幣制起見、曾派財政部高等顧問兼江海關監督唐海安氏、再度偕省農林局長馮銳南下、詳商一切、嗣因粵省對白銀移送中央保管問題、難以辦到、故唐氏此行、毫無結果、日內卽將北返、同時唐壽氏貝祖貽兩氏之南行、亦已證實中止、申時社記者、昨特分訪關係方面、探得詳情如下：</p>
<p>兩次商討改制經過</p>
<p>據金融界熟悉此問題之某君談、財政部自於去年址一月遵奉中央法令、實施幣制政策以來、各省先後奉行、故外匯穩定、中外稱便、粵省當局、以持毫洋制關係、迄未改用大洋制、財部以全國幣制、自應統一、乃於本年四月、派高等顧問兼江海關監督唐海安氏赴粵、與該省財政當局洽商一切、曾由粵省財政當局會同銀行專家專案研討後、卽决定辦法、交唐氏携京、幷派農林局長馮銳隨同晋京、商討一切、亦經擬定具體辦法、仍派唐氏偕馮銳返粵，以資辦理、此爲財部兩决與粵省當局商改大洋制之經過、</p>
<p>白銀出售洽商擱淺</p>
<p>唐馮兩氏抵港後、初則唐氏暫留香港、、馮則卽行返省、嗣聞因關於白銀移送中央保管一部、未能商妥、且粵省方面、以爲白銀移交中央保管、似難辦到、且自動由法幣委員會派員赴港、建造大銀倉、以保管粵省存銀、故决中止移交中央、並表示苟中央必欲統一幣制、須另圖妥莠方法、粵方無不接納之理、故唐氏雖有此行、事實上恐未與粵省當局作直接洽商、而折回香港、同時近日報傳粵省當局、已將所存現銀準備出售外商外、尚有多數已運港、存入外商銀行等等、據此而觀、粵省改用大洋制問題、暫時似已擱淺、</p>
<p>粵員曾來京滬調查</p>
<p>又據探悉粵省法幣委員會、最近曾派秘書周樹常北來京滬等地、調査金融狀况、並擬籌組粵省法幣分會等、然其結果、未得十分圓滿、乃於上星期末返粵報告當局、故粵省近日將白銀出售與運存港外商銀行截然辦法、或亦决定於此、</p>
<p>唐貝不往海安將返</p>
<p>外據確息、奉財政部派赴粵省協助商討改用大洋制問題及整理外匯之交通銀行經理唐壽民、中國銀行上海分行經理貝　貽兩氏、現以此問題、已入擱淺狀態、故已决定中止南行、將俟財部决定方針後、再行决定、至於啣命赴粵商改大洋制之唐海安、亦以此行未獲結果、業已由粵回港候輸、以便卽日北返覆命、</p>

<p>結果允展期惟限十五日前遷讓　組織公共租界各處棚戶合會</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、昨派探捕驅逐滬東區棚戶、各棚戶以便桶掃帚包圍探捕、茲經新聲社記者、探誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>總數逾萬</p>
<p>公共租界滬東區一帶棚戶、散居於平涼路·榆林路·齊物浦路·齊齊哈爾路·培開爾路·和龍路·眉州路·河間路·甯國路·臨青路·西湖路·朝陽路·華德路·塘山路·昆明路·舟山路·格蘭路·黎平路·龍江路·福甯路·等各地、總計約一萬餘戶、</p>
<p>棚戶沿革</p>
<p>此輩棚戶、均係江北來滬謀生之苦力、因房租昂貴、故在荒僻地段、蓋搭盧席棚以居、而此項空地、有係荒地死浜、有係納地租於產主、有係工部局土地、在過去因屬鄉僻、故產主工部局均不與計較、迨至近年市況日見繁盛、工部局於前年曾擬加訂門牌以增巡捕捐之收入、因遭反對、而未實行、</p>
<p>分限勒遷</p>
<p>最近工部局曾一再派員抽查、並於棚戶大門上編列綠漆號碼、擬重行編訂門牌、同時對蘭路以西之棚戶、發出布告云、為布告事、此草棚位置、在眉州路之西、及和龍路之北、道契第七八四二號、本局命該棚戶、須於一九三六年七月十一日前遷移、否則即行拆除、特此布告、而對蘭路以東棚戶、則限八月八日前遷移、</p>
<p>武裝驅逐</p>
<p>昨日上午八時榆林路捕房、安東路工部局分局、派武裝中西探捕五十餘人、分至鹽山路齊齊哈爾路一帶、勒僅各棚戶、即刻遷移、並謂如不遷、即須代行拆除、該處棚戶除哀求展緩外、並分批至其他各處報告、要求協助、</p>
<p>被眾包圍</p>
<p>迨至九時、各處棚戶、女者擕帶便桶一只、幼孩持便桶洗帚、男者持掃帚、紛紛廣集二千餘人、將五十餘名探捕、圍在垓心、婦女均將便桶疊於探捕所立之四周、幾於一座圍墻、人數眾多、呌罵不絕、雙方相持不下、殊亦太惡作劇矣、</p>
<p>展期五天</p>
<p>當時西捕頭凶無法對付、經與眾集議之下、轉告棚戶、謂習決展期五天、至十五日、（星期三）惟須在此期內遷移、否則屆時將派探捕一百二十名、及英國兵強制拆除、當時各棚戶以此事暫告解決、乃各散去、探捕亦各悻悻而去、</p>
<p>請求交涉</p>
<p>各棚戶除前日向市民會請求交涉外、曾向工部局會辦何德奎要求免於遷讓、未蒙允准、復向納稅會請願救濟、由秘書陶樂勤接見、允依照辦理、同時分呈市黨部·市政府·社會局·請求抗議、擬再呈行政院·外交部·市商會救濟、又租界滬西滬北各處棚戶、因同病相憐、昨均派員慰問、並經決定組織上海公共租界各處棚戶聯合會、進行交涉云、</p>
<p>終身、強盜部分、仍處徒刑七年、執行死刑、顧犯聞判、仍處死刑、頓時面色慘變、呆若木雞、默無一言、官諭知倘爾不服判決、仍可依法提起上訴、即由法警將該犯帶下、送回看守所收押、</p>

<p>實力檢討</p>
<p>關於我們選手的實力與參加這决大會的展望、我這兩天會同幾位敎練作了幾决詳細的談話、</p>
<p>田徑和游泳、我們的成績這兩年雖然突飛猛晋、但是和各國名手相較、仍就相差很遠、我問馬的翰先生對我們的選手、是吾存什麼希望、他老先生只是搖着頭、如果我們一定要對一兩位選手存一點希望的話、那末當然是撐竿跳的符保盧、跳高的吳必顯、保盧有過叫米出頭的成績、美日兩國跳四米三十的有五六個、但是保盧的奮鬥精神是很堅强的、也許在會塲能出力拼上一拼、必顯有一米九〇的實力、上决世運冠軍、不過跳一米九七、且等他上塲幹着看吧、總之、馬先生的意思不要因這决不能得分而氣餒含羞、却要因這决參加而多得一些經騐、多得一些刺激、使我國體育、今後走上一個新的階段、</p>
<p>籃球選手的實力、據董守義敎練說、我們是很堅强的、但是參加大會的各國、恐怕都不見得軟弱、美國之將穩取錦標、固爲一致公認、就是南美各國與加拿大、實力也很可怕、因爲籃球的發源、是在靑年會、南美和加拿大組織靑年會的歷史、已是很久很久、換句話說、他們提倡籃球的歷史、已很悠遠、恐怕我們尙非共敵、至於歐洲各國、籃球提倡不久、但是他們體格都很强壯、這决旣然報名參加、常然早已積極訓練、實力未可厚非、所以我們的前途、不可樂觀、唯一的希望、就是憑我們隊員奮鬥的精神、能多打幾塲、多得些經騐、大會籃球比賽秩序、尙未排定、要到德國後才曉得、我們當然希望首先遇着的是歐洲的隊、但至於我們的陣綫現在也未决定、將隨機應變、挑選出戰、董先生對陣綫的支配、胸中是根有成竹的、</p>
<p>國術方面、我們共有九位代表、但爲表演性質、並非參加比賽、記者在上海時、曾遇德國海通社駐華代表費爾浩斯君、他會參觀過我們代表的表演、非常驚奇讚美、據他說、這决到德國去、必定能轟動一時、恐怕柏林表演後、還有許多大城要請去表演、我把這個消息吿訴了我們的選手、大家都根興奮快樂、</p>
<p>三十二軍所派的四位拳擊代表、一般人都不很重視、以爲一登世界舞臺、就要被人家打得鼻腫血流、倒下地來、其實這樣的觀念、是錯誤的、據說商震軍長提倡軍隊中的體育、不過兩年的時光、不但已使士兵的興趣知識、提高得很多、並且發生很大的實際的效用、譬如說他們訓練士兵游泳、有一决勦匪時、遇着一條大河、士兵們因受過訓練、就游過河去追勦、他們練習馬球、以致所有騎兵的騎術、都很高明、允共是拳擊這樣運動、當兩人對打的時候、就是被擊倒在地祇要能爬得起來、還是要繼續抵抗、這種一息尙存、拚命奮鬥的情神、對於整個軍隊，是有很大的關係的、所以這次派四位選手去、我們不可等閒視之、這四位選手的實力、並不很弱、他們並不想得什麽錦標、祇希望能多得一些經騐、把全事士兵拳擊的興趣技術、提高起來、</p>
<p>競走這决也派了四位代表、他們內成績與世界一流選手相差並不很遠、也許這决會出一個冷門都說不定、</p>
<p>舉重的三位代表、上船後練習很勤、不失大力士的本色、他們的成績與世界名手也相差不遠、有無希望、現在當然難以推斷、</p>
<p>足球隊現在還在沿途比賽、尙未吃過敗仗、但是遇到歐洲及南美各國機器似的球隊、恐均是凶多吉少、</p>
<p>現在距大會開慕之期、已是一天近似一天了、全團到達柏林後、還有一個星期練習的機會、全體的精神都很興奮、鬥志也很堅强、道是可以吿慰國內關心的人們的、</p>
<p>抵星加坡</p>
<p>今天（二日）早晨、睡夢中被喧擾聲驚醒、大家因爲快到新加坡、所以起來得特別早、走到甲板上去的時候、看見海面上有許多小島、這就是仰慕已久的南洋羣島了、海水由深藍色變成碧綠色、平靜無瀾、郵船緩緩的前進、現出一種安閑的氣概、</p>
<p>九點多鐘、新加坡呈現在我們的眼簾了、許多高大的洋樓、一字長蛇陣似的排列在海濱、異常整齊、伸到水中的船棧、停了許多巨輪、十足成示牠是歐亞問一個交通的重心、</p>
<p>輸船靠停是十點鐘的光景、碼頭上站了幾百位歡迎的僑胞、都穿着白色的衣服、手裹拿了小的黨國旗、常郵船駛近時、就高聲歡呼中華民國萬歲、我們靠在船舷上、也熱烈的報以歡呼、情形眞是緊張到了萬分、</p>
<p>海關優待代表團、免除檢查護照的手續、但是因爲要等共他旅客騐完護照後、一同下船、所以時間竟遲延到十一點半、</p>
<p>照耀得非常光明的太陽、當大衆正準備下船的時候突然陰沉下來、一陣狂風帶來了猛烈的暴雨、正同在香港下船時一樣、代表團與雨大概是很有緣的、</p>
<p>雨後新加坡的氣候非常凉爽、絲毫不像我們理想中熱帶的氣候、據說新加坡早上是很凉爽的、中午最高　度也不過九十二度、夜間則降至五十多度、全年都是這樣、較之京滬一帶的氣候、好得多了、</p>
<p>下船後、全體分乘大小汽車數十輛、由當地僑胞代表倍同、魚貫遊覽全市、汽車所過之處、僑胞歡聲雷動、他們對於祖國關懷的迫切、非身歷其境、是不容易想像的、</p>
<p>新加坡眞是一個美麗的都市、房屋建築非常整齊、馬路之平坦淸潔、我在國內還沒有看見過、加以終年常綠、决沒有那種荒凉枯肅的景象、當我們穿過植物園的時候、綠棄成蔭、碧草爲茵、眞令人覺得可愛、</p>
<p>遊行一個多鐘頭、於下午一時許到了新加坡的遊藝塲「大世界」、華僑各團體聯合舉行歡迎大會、由僑胞代表林慶年胡昌耀相繼致歡迎詞、代表團由郵更生答詞、各團體贈「海外揚威」旗、由沈嗣良接受、儀式完畢、卽行公宴、席爲中餐、大家在輪船上吃膩了西菜、此時換換口胃、都飽餐一頓、</p>
<p>公宴畢、華僑籃球隊將與代表團舉行友誼賽、這封信等着發、一切詳情、俟抵哥倫坡時再行報吿吧、（七月二日發自新加坡）（完）</p>

<p>紗—比去年最高還高三元五角　花—陳花本月期五十元少一角</p>
<p>其漲也驟　其跌也速</p>
<p>紗市晨漲午回、遠期最高峯曾達二百十九元八角、較去歲十二月四日最高之二百十六元三角、超過三元五角、蓋美棉再接再厲、青雲直上、新多頭乘勢猛進、市價乃邁步上升、無如價格高昂、散戶獲利紛紛脫手、多方雖努力拉提、市價已不免受其牽制矣、</p>
<p>漲風至收盤始戢</p>
<p>標紗上午開盤、承昨日暴漲之餘威、益以美棉之繼漲增高、多頭興高彩烈、市價一往直前、本月份飛漲四元三角、餘月漲二元一角至三元一角、二盤堅穩、漲至八角、三盤因原棉青雲直上、帶高七角至一元、收盤七至九月尚屬堅定、詎料拍至十月期散多獲利了結、一時買戶缺乏、檯面突然鬆動、跌一元四角、十一十二兩月因十月市氣轉虛、賣風乘機而起、隨跌二元、結果較昨日收盤價近期漲四元三角、至四元五角、中遠期漲一元六角至三元、午後開二盤堅定三盤以後、因多頭了結較多、回跌一元、結果較昨日收盤價、漲一元四角至二元五角、查賣出者計澄記一千零五十包、裕康一千零五十包、恒益三千五百包、裕大二千五百十五包、錦昌二千零五十包、明德二千一百包、愼昌二千四百包、愼記一千零五十包、大昌成一千五成包、長豐二千四百五十包、大昶二千九百包、永大順二千四百包、買進者計德大一千一百五十包、大孚二千一百五十包、振大一千四百五十包、合興三千九百包、義康一千包、愼記四千三百五十包、泰昌一千七百包、經華一千四百包、大昌二千一百五十包、同和五千包、</p>
<p>紗綫亦漲三五元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、內地徐州兩帮購胃較健、共成交六百三十九包、行情上午紗漲三元、綫漲五元、下午回跌一元左右、各帮購額如下、</p>
<p>棉市因外棉之繼長增高、市價前進愈猛、上午連漲三盤、陳棉猛跳一元八角五分至一元九角五分、新棉隨漲八角、詎料收盤回紗市回跌、散多獲利、紛求斬結、驟跌一元左右、午後多方再事收買、復升高六七角、無如抬面轉鬆、前進不易、致市盤倏升倏降、各盤間差率甚巨、市況盈虛、瞬息萬變、殊堪驚悸也、</p>
<p>不無受洋花影響</p>
<p>期花上午開盤、因美棉漲風再接再厲、又升二十四至三十七磅音、印棉亦步亦趨、繼漲增高、標棉市塲、人氣愈振、多方興味濃厚、拉力愈猛、陳花飛漲七角五分至八角五分、新花隨漲二角五分至五角、二盤陳花再跳六角五分至七角、新花二角至四角五分、三盤又漲一至五角、步開步高、空氣堅張、詎料收盤棉紗忽現跌風、一般散多、紛紛斬結、八月期猛跌九角、九月期猛跌一元、十月期新花跌風尤烈、一盤跌去一元一角、結果陳花較昨日收盤漲九角五分、十月份新棉且跌去三角、餘月漲一角五分至二角五分、下午開盤多方復從事拉提、陳花回漲四角五分至九角五分、新花亦回漲三角五分至八角、二盤以後、因散多頻頻斬結、市盤稍軟、但陳棉趨勢尚覺堅昂、收盤堅定、結果較昨日收盤價陳花飛漲一元一角五分至一元五角五分、新花漲二至三角查賣出者計裕大三千七百擔、大豐五千一百擔、明德三千一百擔、賡豐四千七百擔、義成昌三百擔、順康一萬二千七百擔、經華二千八百擔、晋康四千四百擔、買進者計德二千三百擔、大孚六千二百擔、胡梅記三千四百擔、通記五千六百擔、錦昌二千一百擔、振大二千五百擔、合興二千六百擔、賡豐二千八百擔、恒德三千一百擔、益昶二千一百擔、大昌成二千一百擔、長豐一萬六千擔、協成二千一百擔、大昶一千五百擔、同和四千九百擔、新亨二千七百擔、源興昌二千五百擔、長和四千九百擔、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、同業·空戶·華爾街·紐奧崙·外商及大眾一致買進、各月漲十至十三磅音、其後棉農套賣、利物浦售出、及多頭了結、略見反動、收盤前大眾買進、又形挺秀、計現貨漲三十七磅音、期貨漲二十四至三十七磅音、現需良好、賣戶不多、設政府借欵棉花不出、市況仍能上升、紡織品活動而堅、海斯德估計本週廠用為二〇七、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為二八九、〇〇〇包、英棉現貨漲六點、期貨漲十七八點、印棉期貨商及歐洲出口商買進、但多頭了結、計平果爾漲一·七五至三·七五羅比、奧姆辣漲二·七五至三羅比、白羅溪漲三羅比、原電錄左、（十日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十一日四五月期白羅溪花開盤預測、為二百二十九羅比半、較上日漲二羅比、</p>
<p>十一日大阪電、三品期紗漲二元九角至四元五角、近月為二百十一元八角、遠月為二百零八元八角、期棉漲一元至三元零五分、近月為七十六元二角、遠月為六十七元四角、</p>
<h3 id="c184">疋頭　廠布一再升漲 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>昨日棉布因紗花市面突飛猛晋、氣勢極為雄厚、布業人氣亦非常激昂、各貨無確實售盤、實銷頗受限制、升漲不一、白貨龍頭喇叭童細布、晨市略有開出三百餘包、較昨又漲五分外、入後廠家行家鑒於市面狂亂、不願再行開售、東貨及本廠細面售盤加起每疋一角半、輕重磅粗布加起每疋一角、細斜漲起每疋二角、各帮裝貨仍以長沙漢口宜昌為最繁、進各廠嗶嘰直貢花布府綢及本廠細布細斜等貨共裝六百餘件、多數職早時預先購訂者、恒豐成廠出品印花絨中柄小柄水浪三擋、本年開盤與光中貨相埒、最近共拋出期貨七八百件、以漢口帮獨進三百餘為最多、本街因怡和漂布條漂尚未升價、昨乘機吸收金三塔漂布五福條子漂布六十餘箱、怡和廠本年新出法蘭絨、開盤每疋十元、走銷甚佳、最近升至十元零二角、以後再須觀漲云、</p>
<p>呢絨定貨寥落異常</p>
<p>昨呢絨交易清淡、出口貨依然非常有海關完稅證不可、各貨行情悉與週初彷彿、洋行定貨生意、刻均寥落異常、申地英美日法德意諸行家、咸無交易、其原因為裝船期過遲、加之本廠呢絨、出品良佳、有東西洋毛料激漲、定價增加、有以致之耳、</p>

<p>期麥突又暴騰</p>
<p>本月份因到貨甚旺漲度尚微</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、開盤後、各月份又呈一致暴騰之象、因洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、又高漲一元至一元一角不等、故開價時、人心激昂異常、本月份因到源暢旺、漲度僅為五分、自八月份以下、則步步高騰、自九分漲至一角二分或一角六七分、此種情形、以粉價受當局之制止、凡有麵粉套頭、不得不補進小麥、又因業外投機活動、吸力甚強、致漲度猛烈、迨至下午開盤、近期市面、亦為帶振、較上午續漲四五分、九月份以下、交易仍暢、價則轉定、微小一二分、此後如國外麥收轉平、投機交易、勢須大小一二分、此後如國外麥收轉平、投機交易、勢須大減、市面方可漸入正途矣、現麥市面、到源甚旺、價則仍無上落、惟行家白辦之貨、因現到防　、一部份均套入交易所、故見交未見大暢、開鳥表麥四元四角半、次四角二分、鎭江麥四元二角半、淮安麥四元四角五七分、南京麥四元三角、次二角八分、揚州麥四元三角二分、瓜州麥四元二角、江北麥四元三角七分、江新州麥四元四角、江西麥四元三角八分、漢口麥四元二角三分、又車麥四元三角、　麥四元一角二分、次至三元九角半、福新去八千包、阜豐去三千包、申大去一千包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、美國與加拿大作物繼續枯斃、預測無雨、套賣雖踴、然市塲吸收甚易、加麥市況甚強、政府估計春麥產量為一二六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇斛、冬麥五一二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇斛、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤、各月份市面、仍無變化、因價經限定、自然一無軒輊、不過日來洋麥漲落亦巨、如昨日報價、又漲一元一角不等、多頭方面、不免均思買進、因此依然買多而賣小、惟經紀人因便於雙方需要、多自行了結、外傳暗盤、尚無可據、至各廠現粉、以本街去化漸暢、已改喊三元一角二分半、至三元一角半云、</p>

<p>溫州新豆續到</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴、自國外宣佈八月二十一日起、增加進口稅後、（每担約加國幣七八元左右）故日來行市最高價曾開十五元、近幾日因船艙在八月十五日前、已無噸位可預定、故市氣稍殺、然因存底枯薄、尚有五六百噸之譜、市價亦須十四元六七角、業已登峯造極、因無輪裝運、昨由榨沿廠辦去駐馬店豆千餘包、蚌埠豆二車、內地本街等辦去杜豆沙黃四五百包、新黃豆溫州貨第二批續到一百五六十包、貨品稍高、須待善價而沽、故未做開、</p>

<p>（滬南）各帮來源、共到十七八號、貨共三千六七百石、零銷仍呆、包胃大連青島帮亦祇辦高貨七八百包、故市況疲萎殊甚、似有一蹶不振之勢、厚早粳價續跌幾分及角許、薄稻高料尚定、中次貨亦短角許、杜洋尖未開、陰變元去路雖呆、然以貨稀、賣方不願輕售、市無上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源餘號、市上各貨去胃寥若晨星、白粳新鮮者價小一角左在、縮次之貨絕無顧問、薄稻鮮艷者貨稀、價形勉立、白元高定、中次者略帶疲勢、杜埠客秈其餘各貨、價形亦小近角、</p>

<p>昨客秈到頭不絕、而行囤所存各秈與洋米等亦主貶價求脫、因天氣炎熱、存米不免有蒸壞之處、奈本客去化均淡、貨主欲脫不能、昨內地帮與北帮進胃更滯、本街交易亦淡、統市開出江西米七百三十六包、湖南米三百九十包、總計祇逾千包、而行情續削角外、今後去化仍如昨前之呆滯、則後市米價終難轉機也、</p>

<p>— 張一志</p>
<p>勤是人生的至寶，也是立身的要道，古語說：「繩鋸而木斷，水滴而石穿。」這就是勤的明證呀！</p>
<p>有某鄉人，家裏非常貧窮，但是他做事很能勤勞刻苦﹔雖然在灼熱的夏天，烈日晒得肌膚像要裂開來一般，他仍勤作不輟。北風烈烈，人所共畏的冬日，而他不怕嚴寒，勤作如故。這樣過了好久，他漸漸的成功小康了﹐又後來，竟漸漸成爲富家。</p>
<p>又有一個學生他天資非常愚笨，每逢考試，總是落後。後來，他自己覺得很慚愧，於是就發奮勤讀，不分晝夜，不畏寒暑，久而久之，他的學問竟得到非常的進步。後來，雖然天資勝過他的人，也趕不上他了。小朋友一個人只要能夠「勤」，窮的會轉富，笨的會成聰明。你想！勤的效力是多麼大！</p>
<p>現在是科學戰爭時代，小朋友！我們更當勤於運用我們的雙手和大腦，要知道，現代只有科學能勝利，能生存，科學也只有勤用手腦去開發。</p>
<h3 id="c198">守時刻的故事 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>中國人守時刻這回事﹐一向是不大注意的。譬如的友相會，旣已訂定時刻﹐自應準時赴的﹐才不失信。可是誤時的也有﹐失的的也有。這種事想小朋友也有親自碰到的﹐也有聽人家講過的。還有像開會赴宴﹐能守時刻的固未嘗沒有﹐但不守時刻的也很多﹐這裏也不再多說了。現在且舉一件因守時刻﹐遭人批評﹐結果失的的人，反討沒趣的故事來﹐說給小朋友聽聽：</p>
<p>後漢有位陳實﹐號呌仲弓。他的德行﹐是爲人人所敬仰的。他死後﹐海內來弔喪的有三萬多人﹐穿麻衣的有一百多人。他有二位兒子：一位名紀，號元方﹐一位名諶﹐號季方。因從小受有良好的家庭敎育﹐所以元方﹐季方也很有名。陳家的略歷，已粗述一過；接下，就要談仲弓先生守時刻的故事了。</p>
<p>一天﹐仲弓先生和一位友人的定到一地方去﹐的定的時刻是正午。那知到了正午﹐這位朋友還不來﹐因此伸弓先生便獨自去了。他去後﹐這位朋友才來。到得陳家門前，見元方正在嬉戲﹐那時他才只七歲咧，因問道：「你的爸爸在家嗎？」元方答道：「你老人家多時，不見到﹐爸爸已去了。」來人聽了﹐怒道：「不是人！和人的好﹐竟獨個去。」元方道：「你老人家和我爸爸的定的時刻是正午呀。正午不至﹐是你無信﹐幷且在人家的兒子面前駡他爸爸﹐則是無禮！」這位朋友被元方說得臉都紅起好了，忙下車要想抱元方，但元方已奔入門裏﹐對他不顧了</p>
<p>小朋友！仲弓先生並沒有什麽不合。他友失信﹐反要說他「非人」﹐自無怪要討沒趣了。元方那時不過七歲﹐已能知禮﹐亦是可敬。從這故事看來﹐不守時刻的習慣﹐從古已是如此﹐我們應當自己矯正它。</p>

<p>敏兒是在小學六年級讀書，今年已畢業了。在未畢業之前同學們覺得耍從此分離，所以他們的感情是非常的融洽，彼此交換着自己﹐照片﹐以留永久的紀念。敏兒當然也有很多的同學向他討照片，於是他决定在星期日預備到照相館裏去拍照。沒有一星期光陰，照相已印好了，當他到照相館裏去职照的時候，發生了很的疑問：</p>
<p>『先生，你們怎能在幾秒鐘之間，能把我的像在這紙上？』</p>
<p>『這句話，要回答你倒很有長長的一大篇，我只得從頭到尾的講給你聽：　照相最重要的東西，就是軟片。用玻璃板或一種軟紙，在一面塗上一種化畢藥品，使它乾燥後﹐便是軟片了。這軟片有什麼用處呢？把軟片裝在照相鏡箱裏，你所欲拍的東西出鏡頭中直射到片上。軟片上的化學藥品，一見了光就要起變化﹐外來，光錢射到片上，就起變化，並且這光綫有强有弱，那麽軟片上的變化也有深有淺的了，但這所起的變化很小，所以軟片的影像，並不能看見，於是要想法使它清楚。　顯影：軟片上的化學藥品，受到顚影藥品的作用後，凡是已受過光的地方，就變化成黑色的薄層，附在軟片上。受光越强，分解越快﹐顏色亦越深。因此景物最亮的地方﹐在軟片上最黑﹐恰和正像相反，所以在軟片上的像，呌做反像。　反像印出了之後，但軟片上不免還有許多沒有起變化的化學藥品，所以不能見光，因爲還沒有起變化的藥品，如果遇到了光後﹐叉要起變化，不是把軟片要弄壞的嗎？所以必須要經過一種定影的手續。把軟片侵在一種定影藥品之中，使像固定﹐然後用淸水冲洗，把軟片的藥品完全冲去﹐而已變化的藥品仍舊留在片上。這就是你手裹的一種黑色的底片。　要使影像成一張照片，便要有一種特製的紙。這特製的紙和軟片的製法是一樣的。把底片放在紙上﹐在日光中晒，底片之透光的地方，使紙上的藥品起變化，底片上不透光的，藥品便不起變化，這樣紙上的像恰和原來的景好相符合。經過了這樣繫雜的手續，才能成爲一張照片。』</p>

<p>小朋友：夏天一來﹐很多的水菓都上市了：什麼桃啦，李啦﹐楊梅啦﹐西瓜啦……</p>
<p>很多人都敎我們多吃些水菜﹐是的，水菓不但是好吃，而且還含有很豐富的營養料﹐對於我們的身體是很有益的﹐不過﹐有時如果不小心﹐反而會有害的﹐所以我們還得注意下面幾點：</p>
<p>第一﹐不可在馬路上吃﹐因爲馬路上灰塵飛揚﹐其中雜有不少微菌﹐吃了很不合衛生；而且行人衆多﹐我們一面跑一面吃，你想多難看</p>
<p>第二﹐小販擺在路邊販賣的水菓﹐不免會有蒼蠅附着過﹐所以我們應該在家裏用潔凈的水先洗過才好吃﹐如果是要剝皮或切開﹐須先注意所用的刀子是吾淸潔</p>
<p>第三﹐水菓雖然有益身體﹐但是過量多吃也不合衛生的﹐最好是在飯後吃一點。</p>
<p>其他如：吃時必須先洗手；腐壞的和未成熟的水菓﹐都不宜吃；……才合衛生。</p>

<p>小朋友！你們除讀書之外，尙有習字的一節課程﹐也是很重要的﹐因爲學問漸漸地進步上去。書法也要漸漸地習練得端秀﹐那末做出來的文章淸通而書法也佳妙了。但是對於寫字的法則，很是多着呢！我現在先拿「永字八法來談談吧！</p>
<p>唐朝有一個張懷瓘﹐他是一個大書家﹐他對於書法方面﹐很有研究的功夫﹐嘗以永字爲比例﹐稱爲永字八法。一曰「側」﹐卽點也﹐謂一點宜側不宜正也。二曰「勒」﹐卽橫畫也﹐謂橫畫宜抑勒，須有頓挫的功夫﹐俗語所謂「軟硬勁也。三曰「努」﹐卽直畫也﹐直畫就是「豎」﹐謂須用力而爲之也。四曰「　﹐「音踢」卽鈎也﹐謂一　如鈎兒也。五曰「策」﹐卽斜畫向上者也﹐就是說簡略的意思。六曰「掠」﹐卽撇也，書法長撇爲掠﹐猶如掠取的意思﹐敏捷之謂也。七曰「啄」﹐卽右方之短撇也﹐書法短撇爲啄﹐猶如速進之謂也。八曰「磔」﹐「讀如摘」﹐卽捺也﹐書法右之下面爲磔﹐謂移遲之意也。茲將水字八法圖案﹐刋於下面。「或謂永字八法﹐是王羲之所創的﹐」</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>過去，第一屆和第二屆的夏令兒童健康營，我都曾經去觀過，覺得他們不但是一個夏令兒童的健康營，而且，簡直也是個兒童的幸福營﹔常我看了那些天眞活潑的小天使﹐在營里悠閒地生活着時，總會感覺到這些孩子是幸福的，所恨自家不能减去二十歲的年齡，不然，我一定也耍設法加入這個天國裏來的。</p>
<p>第三屆的夏令兒童健康營﹐叉於七月五日開營了，地點是仍舊在去年的老地方，—吳淞車站同濟大學中學都裏。本來，我是預備去參加他們的開營典禮的，但恰巧上午下雨，下午雖然晴了，然而我爲了一點別的事情，所以終於沒有去成功。</p>
<p>開營的第二天，天氣雖則並不「佳」，但是我决定要去參觀一下，並且，順便我還想去訪問一下婦孺救濟院呢！</p>
<p>由那輛蒸汽車把我載到了吳淞鎭，我便頗熟習地找到了同濟大學的中學部：校門前，除了學校牌子之外，又增加了一塊夏令兒童健康營的招牌。裏面的佈置﹐似乎和去年有點不同，組織方面，亦顯然比去年更嚴密了，而且營友也較去年增加了四十名，所以一切設備也比前二决週至。</p>
<p>那裏的地位本來是十分好的，交通環境都非常合宜，而更加之南面有吳淞江，西邊是葉家花園，東首近砲台灣，所以不特地址幽靜，空氣流暢﹐並且風景亦極優美。至於營的內部；正中是大禮堂。左面是敎室，計分甲乙丙丁四組。右側是運動塲，塲里有各種運動設備，如鞦　架，蹺蹺板等。後進就是他們的營房了。</p>

<p>— 子系</p>
<p>在天熟時候﹐大家不約而同的拿起扇子來搧﹐搧來了陣陣的淸風﹐使我們遍體生凉﹐異常爽適。搧扇子怎能驅熱生凉？這眞是個急應明白的科學小問題﹐此刻﹐讓我詳細道來：當天氣酷熱的時候﹐我們總是汗流浹背﹐自然汗大部分是水﹐它會蒸發成汽而散去﹐不過在水化成汽的時候﹐要吸進多量的熱﹐我們的體熱﹐便因汗液的蒸發而散失。</p>
<p>不過﹐汗液蒸發的快慢﹐要隨空氣的濕度而變更﹐換句話說：空氣中含有的水蒸汽少﹕汗液便蒸發得快﹐空氣中含有的水蒸汽多﹐汗液便蒸發得慢。當我們流汗的時候﹐身體周圍的空氣裏水蒸汽逐漸加多﹐蒸發作用也逐漸緩慢﹐我們的體熱﹐就不能迅速的散失﹐因此﹐仍覺很熱。反之：若把扇子搧幾下﹐使空氣流動﹐近處含水蒸多的空氣﹐就往遠處流去﹐遠處含水蒸汽少的空氣﹐也會向近處流來﹐人體周圍的空氣只含少量的水蒸氣﹐汗液蒸發自然很快﹐我們的體熱也能　速散失﹐這時﹐我們當然會感覺凉爽起來啦。</p>

<p>— 珠街閣小學校沈績芬</p>
<p>說起了花木蘭，你們大家都知道她是一個勇敢的女孩兒吧！可是她在中國很久的歷史上，同時也可以說是一個偉大的民族英雄</p>
<p>花木蘭她是隋朝年間的人，她家裏頭有爸爸，有媽媽·還有姐姐·弟弟·她的爸是當武將的在家中過，那時她着紡織的生活，很是快樂</p>
<p>那個時候西北邊上，有一個番邦要想來搶我們完整的，土地所以國家就大大微兵，預備抵抗那些蠻强的的外人維知徵兵的告示上，也有木蘭爸爸的名字，這使木蘭　急了好多天，因爲她的爸爸年紀己老了，不能冉出去和敵人戰爭，她又沒有哥哥代替爸爸到前綫去，那怎麽辦呢？她自言自語的說：『難道我做了一個女子就不能爲國家爭光榮，就不能代替一年的爸爸去打仗嗎？不！我老定耍去，我爲了爸爸﹐爲了國家，我一定要去嘗試一下，不過最討厭的就是這不開化的社會，壓根兒就不答應我們女子往前綫去的我要是穿了男子的衣服，不就像一個男子了嗎？』結果她得了爸媽的同意，扮了一個男子，竟獨個兒出征去了。後來，她和敵人開戰，經過了千山萬水，殺了不少敵寇兵將，啊！木蘭都勇敢極了！她說：『我要抵抗到底！我一定要把那些敵寇殺盡﹐』果然，因爲她膽大心細﹐把那些敵兵，眞的殺得落花流水，大敗而去。木蘭打勝了敵兵﹐升做了將軍，就領了她的軍隊回朝去。計算起來，她在外面﹐一共過了十二年，是得了天子的　譽而回家的。</p>
<p>諸位！關於本蘭的故事？我講到這裏，也就完了，那麼我們就來想一想：　人做偉大的事業，只要有勇氣﹐有毅力﹐都可以得到成功的結果，同時，不論男的女的﹐也同樣可得到偉大事業的成功。木蘭的代父從軍，是很好的例證。</p>
<p>不過現在有一般人，終以爲女子的能力不及男子：男這子做的事﹐女子就不能做是不對的﹐男子們當的事，女子們不敢去當，那更是莫大的錯誤。所以老師們常常對我們說：『將來你們的責任很重呢！』是的，將來女子和男子，責任一樣很重。將來我們長大了一定也要學花木蘭有勇敢殺敵的精神！那才沒有人敢欺侮我們了。</p>

<p>只爲新下了一塲雪﹐小南洛的脚跡實在是模糊得很，隱隱約的的可以瞧到他是向那盎凡爾鎭去的。柏德希找到了夜半，方從鎭外進了那些黑暗和狹隘的街道。這一個盎凡爾鎭也完全包裹在一片黑暗之中，人家的窗板裏，偶然有一絲絲的燈光漏將出來，有時碰到一羣的人打着燈回家去，他們都已喝醉了酒，口中嗚嗚地哼着歌兒。街中都蓋着雪，皚皚一白，那高高的黑色的牆，和屋頂，都給白雪襯托了出來，四下裏也靜悄悄的沒有聲息，只聽得風聲呼呼地愈括愈大，括得那路燈的高杆也搖動起來。</p>
<p>因爲常有行人走過，脚跡攪亂，柏德希要找尋小南洛叉加上了一重困難﹐然而它並不退縮，依然奮勇的進行，雖是冷風砭骨，堅冰刺脚，餓火在肚子裏燃燒着，都不能打消它的勇氣。一路的前進，前進，挨受着無窮的困苦，終於跟着小南洛的脚跡，跑上了那大禮拜寺的石階。</p>
<p>柏德希晤暗的想道：『他又跑去瞧他心愛的東西了。』雖並不明白這是什麽一回事，然而對於小南洛愛好美術的癖性，也抱着充分的憐憫和同情。</p>
<p>這夜大禮拜寺中行過了夜半的彌撇禮，有一扇門恰好沒有關上﹐也許是信徒們急於要回後，一時疏忽，沒有下鎖之故，於是柏德希就跟着一行隱約的脚跡，趕進門去，在號烏黑的石地板上，撤下了許多的白雪。它一直走到了聖壇的心前，一眼瞧見了它所苦苦追尋的小南洛，正直僵僵躺地在石級上。它悄悄地爬上前去，接觸小南洛的臉﹐似乎對他說道：『您以爲我是個不義的東西，而貪圖着自己的安樂，就把你拋下了嗎？您以爲我是一頭平凡的狗嗎？』</p>
<p>小南洛低低的吶喊了一聲緊緊地將柏德希抱住了。低聲向它說道﹕『讓我們躺下來死在一起吧。人們並不需耍我們，我們在這世界是孤獨的了。』柏德希更爬近了一些，把它的頭貼在小南洛的胸口。它那憂鬱的棕色眼睛裏，含着兩大泡子的眼淚，表示它心中的快樂。</p>
<p>他們倆在卽刻骨似的寒氣中，貼緊着躺在一起。那一陣陣的風從北面海洋中掠過了河　襲來，直好似冰浪一般，凡是生物接觸到了，都會得凍給起來。他們躺在這挺大的石窖中間，比了外面蓋着　的平原更覺寒冷，常常有一頭蝙蝠在黑影中飛動着—常常有一綫亮光，直射到那一排排的雕像上面，他們一同躺在那羅本氏所畫的聖像下面，一動都不動，因爲給寒氣凍僵了﹐倒好像入了睡夢一般。他們夢見從前快樂的日子，兩下往往在那滿開着花的草原上追趕着，或是同坐在水邊的蘆葦叢中﹐看那一艘艘的船在陽光中駛出海去。</p>
<p>小南洛和柏德希之間，從沒有一絲黑雲籠罩在他們的交誼上，因此兩下裏總是相親相愛﹐不曾分離過一决。在他們短促的生命中，已盡了自己應盡的責任，對於任何人都沒有對不起的事情，生平因爲並沒有犯過什麽罪惡，所以在良心上是很快樂，很滿足的。他們倆被餓火和塞氣夾攻着，血管中的血也似乎漸漸地凍結起來﹐但他們還是在夢想着舊日的快樂光陰﹐挨過這漫漫的長夜。</p>

<h3 id="c209">德國物價昂貴與食料品缺乏的原因 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 原亭</p>
<p>去年九月四日﹐德國政府會經公布了牛肉·猪肉·臘腸及鷄蛋等物的最高價格，規定道些物品的價格不得超過一九三五年三月的水準。這顯然的是因爲德國的物價在日益上漲，所以希特勒政府才不得不以命令來抑制。但是，這種物價昂貴的情形在德國官廳的統計中是看不到的，如去年六，七，八，九月德國官廳的統計就是這樣：</p>
<p>這樣的官廳統計乃是依據幾種價格不變的商品﹐依據政府的規定做成的，所以一般市塲的價格在這中間不能見到。</p>
<p>一般說來，在現狀下的德國的一般報章雜誌中，也一樣不能見到德國物價昂貴的眞實情形。但德國的某些刊物有時却也很曲折地透露出一點眞確消息來，如雜誌「德意志經濟家」所載：「很明顯的，食料品指數的運動主要是由價格不變商品(如牛乳，麵包等等）决定的，但這些物品之對於食料品的交易的比重不是决定的。且據統計當局的報告，像乳酪，臘腸，生菜油，果實等等的價格都遠在統計數字之上」。這如果翻成很直率的言語，便是說德國官廳的統計是以價格不變的商品爲基礎的，而這些商品對市塲交易又沒有决定的意義，所以官廳的統計無異是一種欺騙。</p>
<p>近年來希特勒政府的價格政策，一方面是使　物的公定價格不增加﹐但另一方面却使家　的飼料價格日益騰貴了。前年因爲收成不好﹐　物不足四百萬噸，由輸入增加補充的不過五十萬噸，這使　物更感缺乏，而飼料的價格在荒歉的年頭當然也就更騰貴了。飼料不消說是由土地生產出來的﹐所以它的價格昂貴當然有益於佔有土地的地主和富農﹐但在另一方面，對於貧農與中農的生活却是重大的打擊。因爲飼養家畜是一般農民主要的副業，今飼料價格昂貴，使他們養家畜的收入大爲减少，有時茶至使這項收入根本發生問題，這對於平素就很弱困的他們當然是很苦惱的；同時德國政府的現行政策又要限制家畜和肉類價格的高漲，這結果對於飼養家畜的農民便更加不利了。</p>
<p>因爲飼料價格的昂貴，家畜和肉類價格被限制，農民飼養家畜的數量隨之减少，結果又招來了肉類和油類大感缺乏的現象。拿猪來說，農民飼養的猪去年比較起前年的來就减少了百分之十，用於屠殺的猪也减少了百分之一五·九以上，最近這减少現象還在發展中。</p>
<p>在去年和前年肉類和油類的輸入中，更可見到德國這類物品的缺乏。請看下表吧——(單位千噸）</p>
<p>這中間値得特別注意的，是人工乳酪生產之基礎的採油用的種實及其他的大大的减少。因爲這中問含有的百分之三五的油，所以其輸入那樣的减少便是油脂减少了的二十五萬噸，便是表現了德國的牛酪消費的有二分之一的不足。</p>
<p>但是，像德國這樣的物價昂貴與食料品缺乏，其原因究竟安在呢？依德國官方的解釋，則是在於德國人民的生活改善，需要增加。有一個官方雜誌說：「我們今日感到了若干農產物輕微的缺乏。實際上這缺乏是一種好現象。我們不得不記着這樣的事情，卽由許多重要的原因使生產物的需要增大，從而其消費也增大了。如果一考察的有四百五十萬人回到生產過程之結果，使購買力增加這一事實﹐那這問題便可完全理解了。在這塲合，購買力的增大當然要首先影響到食料品市塲的。」於是，食料品大感缺乏，其價格也就日益昂貴了。同時﹐官辦的景氣硏究所更依從宣傳部長戈培爾的指令說道。「無論如何，食料品的缺乏是發生了。但這個事實不外需要增大的說明。這在麫包與飲料牛乳也是一樣。同時，因飲料牛乳需要增大的結果﹐更使得麫包製造所使用的牛乳量减少。自然，在需要增大中也有軍隊需要之增加，但主要的理由還是在於人民幸福的增進。」這也很明顯的是將德國物價昂貴和食料品缺乏的原因歸於客親需要增加，人民生活改善的。</p>
<p>但在事實上，如上所說，德國一般農民因爲歲收不佳，飼料價格昂貴，飼養家畜獲利不易，以及各種捐稅負担重大，生活却在日益窮困中，其消費能力也當然要大减特减了；所謂人民生活改善，一般消費能力增大，購買力向上等等，這對於德國一般農民可說完全是相反的意義。至於都市裏的勞動者，他們的生活也是在日益窮化中。事實告訴我們，在危機開始的前一年，德國勞動者的總收入是四四·五七兆兆馬克，到一九三二年時，他們的總收入便只有二六兆兆馬克了，兩相比較，幾乎减少了一半。及至去年﹐據說德國勞動者的收入又回漲至三一·七六兆兆馬克，但據本年德國龐大的預算看來，今後德國勞動者恐將要担負更重大的捐稅，他們的收入恐將要更多的减少；而且德政府的减少失業的辦法，是在於剝削在業工人以救濟失業工人﹐所以實際上卽使勞動者們的總收入有所增加﹐但他們各個人的收入却是在减少的。據在德國出版的「德意志經濟家」所載，說是阻礙德國消費工業復活的原因有這兩點：「第一，比較以前事業活動增加時期，工資只有一點上昇；其結果是工資總額就在就業者增加的情形下也只有一點增加。第二，這所得的大部分是以租稅的形式流入於國庫中去了」。假使這是相當地透露出了一點眞確消息的，那便是說最近德國勞動者的收入在實際上並未有所增加。這樣﹐德國都市勞動者的收入旣未增加，甚至是還在减少，而在另一方面物價叉日益昂責，生活程度日益增高﹐那他們的生活當然也和鄉村的農民一樣，是在日益窮化中，因而其消費力也就日益减少了。</p>
<p>依據這個事實，便可明白知道德國的物價高漲的原因並不在於客觀需要的增加，購買力的向上；反之，倒是因爲德國農工及一般小市民的更加窮化，妨害了消費工業的復活和發展，所以一般消費品才大感缺乏，物價才日益昂貴。除此之外，還有兩個最重大的原因：第一是通貨膨脹的傾向，人爲地把一般物價提高了；這種現象與德國政府的抑制物價高漲政策顯然是一個大的矛盾。第二是近年來德國的積極準備戰爭，努力擴充軍備，這不僅需要大量的食料品的儲藏，因而使一般食料品日感缺乏﹐價格日益高漲；而且由於在積極準備戰爭擴充軍備中實行建築地下工程，飛機塲，擴張民間航空路，發展各種軍事工業，强制人民買防毒器具等等，使一般消費生產日益减少，那從一般人民身上吸來的血汗可說完全用在那些非生產性的爲準備戰爭的事業中了！</p>

<h3 id="c210">民團 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 張占元</p>
<p>天星寨是我們附近的一座高山，在周圍四十里路以內都找不出這樣險要的寨子了。記得祖父在我們小的時候告訴過我們，藍大順造反時，祖父的父親們便是躱在這座寨子上面，得免於難的。藍大順攻這座山寨﹐一直費了一個月的工夫﹐都沒有攻下，可見天星寨的險峻了。就是在我們小時候，「紅邊邊」(滇軍帶着紅色帽邊，故名)過路時，這寨子也成了近鄰避難的地方。民國反正以來，兵反馬亂，鄉里不靖，這座寨子也時常有大戶人家經常在山上居住的。</p>
<p>我的當民團的一段生活也是在這兒開始的，雖然我現在被改編爲正式軍隊已有兩年了，但是前幾年當民團的滋味﹐仍不時令我回憶起來。原來民團生活比正式軍隊生活要鬆懈得多，愉快得多，曲折有趣得多，决不像我現在這樣要受着鐵一般的紀律的束縛，要絕對地服從命令，那時的情形眞是富於詩意，現在才真地是過着散文式的生活了。</p>
<p>我也不是自己甘心情願要去作民團的。在農村破產，百業蕭條的當兄，農村中總是有簷許多無業可就的窮漢我不到飯吃。他們除了做小偷而外，也三五成羣地幹着打家刦舍的勾當。被打刦的自然是本鄉的「紳糧」了，但保衛本鄉安寗的却不是紳　，而是由紳糧拿錢出來﹐抽派一般中小農家的壯丁去充當。在初，是在農暇時候才來操練的。每値臘月，鎭上的「首人」便盒着各村的「花名冊子」，三丁抽一，五</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>丁抽二的抽去訓練。這呌做「挨門練」，又呌做「門戶練」，這是每個人家都不能規避的，除了大戶人家可以用錢或命令呌他們的「佃客」去充當而外。我是一個中農之家的子弟，在高小學校裏將要畢業了﹐在寒假的空閒中﹐也不免被抽去作「挨門練」。那時我也非常好奇，頗想過着軍隊的生活。雖然門戶練是要逢「二六九」日才「點團」（各壯丁齊集市鎭操演的意義）一次﹐但在那鎮頭上的「廟壩」中，當簷「趕塲」的人們在那團隊中「走正步」，呌簷，「一，二﹐三，四」時，這總覺得是已經嘗着一軍隊生活的滋味。在一早起來，村頭的山峯上便有銅　的聲昔，鑼聲過後，便可以聽見這樣的大聲喊呌：「各花戶壯丁得知，永興塲民團辦事處命令，令爾等立刻到街塲黃桷樹壩集合候點…」不一時各村莊裏卽有荷着槍，穿着短衫，踏着草鞋的各色壯丁，紛紛從家裏出發，到塲鎭「會哨」。我們那時的武器是極不整齊的，有的背着「鳥槍」，有的栳着戈矛「桿子」，有的拿着鐵棒，有帶簷「火把」的﹐也有携着「梆子」的。至於服裝，更是花雜，有些自然也穿簷軍衣，這是退伍回來的兵士﹐他們在挨門練中大小總有官職，不是大隊長，便是中隊長，分隊長，至少也是一個「司務長」，因爲他們都是受過正式的軍事訓練的，此外各中小畢生寒暑假回鄕來參加的，也穿有「學生裝」，「操衣」﹐但是其餘許多「老百姓」，便只好將就他們下田做工時的藍布短衫﹐有些經常做小本生意的人被抽來的﹐因爲不能製備短衫，因而也有把長衫捲上來，用腰帶綑着的。總之，挨門練是最雜色不過的隊伍了。它的任務是聽着鑼聲，集合街塲，聽候「點操」，此外一點作用也沒有。如果眞地有匪人來，他們也是不能去對付的﹐而且他們也「裝隻眼，閉隻眼」，裝做不曉得。</p>
<p>不過在「冬防」吃緊的時候，挨門練受了「團總」的命令﹐也不能不冒着風雪在深夜出去防守。記得在好幾年前﹐驟然風聲吃緊﹐我的學校裏的書也不能讀了。白天自然荷着「快槍」在塲上操練，夜間便爬到山坡上去「守夜」。腰間掛着一口「馬刀」，背上背着一枝槍，衣服穿得厚厚的。同簷三五個壯丁，各人逡巡各人的路口，各人也都明白本隊的口號。身上也繫簷「梆子」，遇有匪警，輕則「打哨子」，「吹呌子」﹐重則「敲梆」。在那樹林中，在那山巖下，總是要捱到鷄呌時才回家來。</p>
<p>書旣不能讀了，鄉里也繼續不大「淸靜」，所以我就由挨門練正式參加新近成立的「團練」，又呌做民團，便駐紥在那座險要的天星寨上。民團生活比挨門練有秩序得多，每早總是五時起床，十分鐘的洗漱，便在晨光熹微中到操塲集合行早操，六時牛早飯。一天是「三操兩講」﹐由早上五時起床直到下午九時。至於團練所穿的服裝，當然也要整齊得多﹐槍枝也是齊全的，也有一定的駐地，而且是長時閒的操演。天星寨就是我們的營　，寨上有座神廟，便把各殿分配爲隊長室，士兵窒，傳達室，號兵房﹐伙夫房等。隊長自然是從正式軍隊退伍下來的兵士或班長排長之類，兵士就是從挨門練中抽選出來的。團練也能領餉項，各「糧戶」除了每月捐給米，柴等伙食用品而外，他們也攤派出一些錢來。我們的隊長每月可得大洋三元至五元，我們兵士只得一元做零用，以備作吃烟穿草鞋之用。各火器都是從糧戶家裏捐來的，由鎭上公家購買的很少。槍，大都是土製的後膛槍，名目有「九子」，「五子」，「毛瑟槍」，「夾板」，「單針」之類，「連槍」(卽手槍)那是只有大隊長才有的。</p>
<p>我們雖然是每日三操兩講，操着正步，跑步﹐臥下，集合﹐解散，似乎生活是非常地緊張，然而實際上是很好玩的。每當星期六﹐我們也可輪流回家。小別了半月的母親，小弟妹﹐也可親熱一下。到星期日下午﹐再把換洗過的衣服負上山去﹐也間或帶着零吃的東西，鹹菜，肉，到寨上去，同弟兄們「打夥」吃。你每一月也可請一次假，自由地去「趕塲」，自由地去「走人戶」。每當下午吃過晚飯，天色尚早時﹐我們有時便携着手在操塲上高唱着軍歌，甚麽「男兒第一志氣高，來學兵式操，哥哥手拿指揮刀，弟弟放槍砲，白旗一面風飄飄，戰鼓鼕鼕敲，……」唱個不休。眼看着遠遠山下的人家，屋上正冒簷一縷炊烟，聽見我們唱軍歌﹐村中小兒們也出來探看﹐久了，也學着我們歌唱。有時我們又登在附近的高峯上去　零﹐休息，談天。俯視着山下樹林　及映着閑金黃色的斜陽，看着橫在　背罪去的牧　　我們一直要玩到天黑了才回去，如果那一夜不該我們一置班」的話，我們可以玩到夜深。</p>
<p>可是每到了「逢塲」時節也免不得要整隊下山，到塲上去「候點」﹐在人叢中走幾個步子﹐擺幾個隊形，然後又才回寨去。到了夜間，如該你「當班」，那便有些苦痛了，尤其在「風聲不好」的時候。每隔一二里路，各山埡上必設有茅草搭的「哨棚」﹐每夜都派有壯丁防守。團練便要每夜去「査哨」，看哨棚裏是否有壯丁，看他們盡不盡責﹐有時也故意去襲擊他們，試騐他們是吾機警。有時荷着槍在黑夜的大雪中放啃。聽着山上樹林裏呼呼的風聲，打著颯颯地雪　，萬　俱寂。這時你一個人也感覺得有些恐怖，有些寂寞。但傳過口號，「會了哨」時﹐你又可以坐在哨棚的溫草堆裏歇一歇。那裏面有的是烟草，有的是煖茶，還有乾的麵餅和高粱酒，這是壯丁們等着我們去，拿來孝敬我們的。哨棚裹充滿着一團和睦的空氣﹐一團溫煖的氣味，不怕棚外是如何厲害的風雪。</p>
<p>除了我們本隊自到塲鎭去「點團」而外﹐每過了三四月又有一次「大會操」，大槪是聚集周圍四五個鎭的民團來合操。我們便時時希望這樣一個機會，我們不啻是去做了一次旅行。在行軍中，我們踏着整齊的步伐，唱簷高吭的軍歌，對山都回響轉來。在會操完畢後，我們又可得到團總們或團練局長的獎賞。</p>
<p>附近的百姓同我們不是親便是戚，對我們非常和睦，决不害怕。我們間或需要一些零星雜物，如菜肴，稻草之類，也可派人到山下人家去討，他們都無不奉送的。有時風聲不緊，我們的操演也不嚴了﹐我們便可以抽空到山下人家去替他們做「活路」﹐他們也很歡迎，並拿好酒好菜給我們吃。落了很大的雪時﹐我們也帶着槍，吹簷「洋號」，同山下人家的小孩們一路作「雪中行軍」，並合唱「雪中行軍歌」：「山中喇叭烏烏吹，山下人家把門開。山下人家你莫驚，我等不是外國兵﹐亦非山中有盜賊，乃是吾輩冒雪來行軍，將來替你打勝戰，保我中華四萬萬……」。</p>

<h3 id="c212">日蝕觀測 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 俊</p>
<p>一般無知識的人﹐對於日蝕的解說向來是很神秘的。他們一看見日蝕現象發生﹐不是說天狗喫日﹐便是說惡魔在吞食太陽；而且﹐卽刻就要打鑼擊鼓﹐希望太陽復原﹐否則人間便會長期黑暗﹐永無光明了。你如果要說這是迷信﹐那他們便要問你：爲什麽日蝕時經過人們的打鑼擊鼓和祈禱後﹐被吃的太陽就會很快的復原了呢？被吃的太陽因祈禱而復原﹐便是日蝕有神怪作用的明證，這是顚撲不破的絕對眞理！像這些人當然一時不能了解日蝕的科學意義﹐那是需要長期的社會敎育的。同時﹐還有一些似通非通的略爲有點科學知識的人們﹐他們也知道一點關於日蝕的天文學的知識﹐但他們却不明白實際研究日蝕的意義他們常發出這樣愚蠢的疑問：日蝕與人類生活有什麽關係呢？研究日蝕又有什麼實際利益呢﹖這可說完全是商賈似的打算﹐以爲科學研究只有研究開金礦﹐發明可以賣大錢的東西﹐才有利益，才有意義﹐而日蝕的研究旣不能獲利，那對於人類生活當然是沒有關係的﹐無益的。這種表現眞是勢利得可以！</p>
<p>但是﹐日蝕的實際研究不僅可以破除一般迷信﹐而且對於天文學乃至一般科學都有極重大的意義。如一九一九年五月二十九日南美等地的日蝕觀測﹐證實了愛因斯坦效果﹐使他的相對性原理更加大發光明，這對於一般科學乃至世界思想都是有深切關係的。因爲研究日蝕有這樣的重要﹐所以全蝕在某處發生時﹐全世界的天文學者﹐科學家便要不辭勞苦﹐前往觀測；若說研究日蝕無意義，那觀測日蝕的科學家又是爲的什麽呢？</p>
<p>部分的日蝕每年總有三四次，但全蝕却只有幾年一决，而且只有在地球上某些地方才可見到。因此﹐觀測全蝕頗不容易；世界上許多著名的科學家都認爲全蝕是難得的研究機會﹐所以每逢蚤蝕將在某地見到之際﹐他們便耍不惜犧牲金錢和精力﹐有組織有計劃地結隊前去觀測。最近的全蝕是在蘇聯的西伯利亞和日本的北海道觀測的﹐一般科學家前往研究的較前更多﹐一時之間﹐所謂觀測日蝕一事竟成爲了世界的一個主要的文化新聞。</p>
<p>依據過去的研究﹐所謂日蝕是在月球運行於地球和太陽之間﹐日光爲月所遮蔽的情况下發生的﹔全蝕卽是在地球的某些地方月將日光完全遮蔽的現象。這已經是無庸疑慮的眞理。現在研究日蝕當然不只是要更證明這個眞理﹐而是有新的目的和意義的。如最近的日蝕研究之目的﹐大概就可以舉出這幾點：</p>
<p>第一﹐研究太陽大氣。我們普通肉眼所見到的太陽是一個直徑的百四十萬基羅的大光球﹐在這周圍有太陽大氣﹔在這太陽大氣的周圍﹐更有薄薄的瓦斯體存在﹐其名爲白光(Corona)。因爲太陽光很强﹐所以平時不能觀測這Corona﹔要全蝕的時候才是觀測它的良好機會。</p>
<p>第二﹐觀測愛因斯坦所倡的光曲折在大氣中究竟是怎樣行的？</p>
<p>第三﹐觀測太陽與月球的相對運行﹐以預測月球將來的運動。</p>
<p>此外還有不是天文學者觀測全蝕的目的﹐那便是在考察：一，日蝕與宇宙綫的關係；二，日蝕如何影響氣候﹔……等等。</p>
<p>這次的日蝕是起始於地中海﹐橫斷西伯利亞，沿北海道的東北海岸進行﹐而終於太平洋的。就中西伯利亞的全蝕時間的二分半﹐北海道的是一分五十秒﹐所以觀測起來頗不容易。但由於現代的觀測裝置﹐觀測的結果却獲得了許多寶貴的村料；這些材料在經過長期整理和研究之後﹐發表出來必將正確地回答上述那些問題，因而對於科學﹐對於世界思想都將有重大的影響。這樣﹐誰還能說這决與過去一般的日蝕研究無用呢？</p>

<h3 id="c213">峨眉山 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>江南是很少山的，一望都是無邊無邊的風野。生長在這原野裏的人們，除了去看看無錫的惠山，杭州的天竺，那只有在書本上和畫面上來領略山的風味了。但是你如果進了四川，那包管你隨處都可以遇着惠山和天竺那樣的山峯。單是坐在船頭上望望巫峽兩岸的雄巖峭壁，也就够你玩味了，何况冉要捨舟登陸，繼續西行呢﹖</p>
<p>古人說：「劍閣天下險，峨眉天下秀」。劍閣究竟怎樣險，我們暫且不去管牠，我們現在要來看峨眉究竟怎樣秀。</p>
<p>要去峨眉登山﹐便先得乘船。現在汽艇已經可以直達嘉定丁。在汽船中看着岷江兩岸的崇山峻嶺，也就使你會想到你已經進了山谷，你已經在登山了一樣。岷江的水同山谷裹的溪流一樣湍急，水的顏色也同山洞裏的池水一樣的淸悠。兩岸的樹林，從山嶺上，山崖邊直垂至江邊，不到正午，太陽光是不會照到正在江中航行的汽船的。正如進了山陰道中，兩旁都是奇草異木，飛鳥的歌唱，猿猴的啼鳴，夾簷呼呼的松嘯，伴着這小艇航行。</p>
<p>捨舟登陸，直赴峨眉縣城。你可以坐汽車去﹐也可以坐滑桿去，也可以乘人力車去。但頂好還是乘人力車，因爲道旁的風景是要行得緩慢才能盡情賞玩的。未到峨眉山之先，你也要經過許多同峨眉一樣淸秀的小峨眉。我們不知道爲甚麽蜀西的山要這樣秀麗。險峻自然是險峻，然而一點也不顯得粗惡，恐怖，眞有點帶着妙齡女郎的曲綫美。山上的樹木呢，自然是濃陰茂密，但是總佈置得稀疎勻稱，决沒有那兒顯得擁擠﹐那兒孤零，更沒有濯濯的童山。最好的是山中的水，溪流﹐池塘，瀑布﹐在石級邊，在森林中，你隨時都可聽到水聲。每一座山頂的樹葉和花瓣都可流到山下的大河裏去。</p>
<p>峨眉是一個聖地，和山西的五台和浙江的普陀是同樣有名。全個峨眉山之道路的修築，廟宇之修建，若不是菩薩的力量，那像現在這樣的成績恐不能够吧？全山寺宇不下一百幾十座﹐上下修築的道路，單是正路也有一百多里。但是神之有靈還是人的力量。比如全國每年去「朝峨眉」的﹐總不下數萬人。允其在暑天，旅行的人是要去避暑，而朝山的人是要去趕「七月半」。所以山上沿途都是絡繹不絕的旅客。「燒香」的人，腰間綑着一個黃布「口袋」，背上背着一個大的「包袱」，手裏也有扶着「拐棍」的，也有敲着木魚的。甚至朝山的人﹐婦女多於男子，老人多於靑年。一百二十里路高的峨眉山，在她們，來回總要幾天或十天的工夫。山上的廟宇全靠朝山的人出的「功果」「香錢」來維持，此外爲客人備辦食宿，也可以賺得一些錢。峨眉山上不產甚麼糧食，全山數千僧衆差不多都要靠着客人爲生。</p>
<p>到了報恩寺，就開始登山了。在山麓下﹐山道還很平坦寬大。仰頭望着上面，也只見着雲巒，只微微地見得着雲縫裏露出的山峯，除了最近數里的山徑﹐樹林，廟宇，行人﹐你隱隱可以分辨外，四周和上面的山峯﹐都是埋在雲海裏的。山路　　曲折的，因爲越向上走，山的斜度越大，小　便要蜿蜒盤旋上去。同行的人在前面的有時會看不見後面的，在後面的也看不見前面的。有許多的廟宇都伏在茂密的森林中，你耍到了牠的面前才會發見。眞合着一「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」兩句話。一偌大的佛殿，靜悄悄地，嚴肅地聳立在山谷樹林中。裏面萬籟俱寂，只聽得　　的木魚之聲。這聲音又調着節奏，在對山上同樣地反　　來。</p>
<p>山勢愈朝上走愈陡，到了蛇倒退，到了九十九倒拐，大概就是最陡峻不過的了吧？甚麼呌做「蛇倒退」呢？就是說從這裏連蛇也爬不上去，就是爬上去也要倒退下來。九十九倒拐呢﹖是說山路的曲折，在四五里內就連折到九十九次。上山的人﹐不能步行的都雇用「背子」。「背子」背上背着一個「背架」，把客人背在背上向山上登去。因山勢甚陡﹐不能用二人合抬的「滑桿」，只能坐一人肩的「背架」，道是峨眉山背後的和山下的風景，你也不能仰望山上和左右的景緻。因爲你身子偶一不愼，就會從那萬丈懸崖上跌下去的。可是到了石級稍爲寬一點到深谷裏去。看着下面的深溝，懸崖，你頭也暈了，目也眩了。然而背子是不在乎的，他可以隨便把背架翻動，叉轉，這時你的性命是完全寄託在背子身上的。</p>
<p>到了洗象池，九老洞，峨眉山已去了一半了﹐大概已走過了一天半或二天的時間。峨眉山上的洞子和水池是很多的，但頂有名的洞是九老洞，頂有名的池是洗象池。九老洞的有九里路深，我們實際只鑽了三里路，那裏面的路徑便狹窄得很了，非用火燭不可行走，沿途都是澄淸的水塘，據說道條洞可以直通山後，但從無人走通過，怕在裹面遇着蟒蛇。九老洞以上，洗象池以下，沿途都有很多的猴子，結隊從樹林中出來，向過往的客人討食麵餅之類，一點也不害怕，甚至有時還要偷劫單身客人的衣物。過了洗象池，氣候便與下山迵然不同了。峨眉山的氣候﹐你如在暑天去，那可以經過春夏秋冬四季。在山脚是夏天，在山腰是春秋，在山頂是冬季。就在盛暑，你也必須預備着棉　上山哩。</p>
<p>過了太子坪，祖師殿，便到金頂了，到了金頂，離山巔便只有四五里路程，這兒也可俯覽全山。從山頂直往下看，只見下面的許多山峯如蓮花瓣一般，重重包着主峯，如衆星之拱北辰。山下半便埋在雲霧裏了﹐有許多崗巒﹐遠近參差﹐時隱時現，恍如海中的衆島，也像飄泊海上的點點漁舟。白雲結成雲堆﹐一朶一朶的如白的棉花一樣。在山下，雷聲是從天空打來，但到了山頂，便只聽見隆隆的雷聲起於脚下。由金頂走數十步到覩光台﹐在下午夕陽西下之時﹐你如站在覩光台上眺望﹐便可看見峨眉山的懸空中現出各種奇妙的佛寺，佛像，金光燦爛，耀人眼目。覩光台之後爲捨身岩，攀登其上，立於懸岩，但見萬丈深溝，看不見底蘊，令人心神驚戰。俗云，從這翻身跳下去，便可以立地成佛，所以呌做捨身岩。山頂空氣稀薄，時多雲雨，整日烟霧瀰漫，沒有大好的晴天。遊人一多，如大家高呼，或敲着朝山的鑼鼓，那天空便立刻飛下細細的毛雨來。這是由於空氣稀薄，氣壓很小的緣故。所以在山頂燒水是不會沸騰的。</p>
<p>由金頂到千佛頂，山千佛頂到萬佛頂﹐已達峨眉的絕巔了。到了萬佛頂，你會感到這山峯太孤寂了，因爲以下的諸峯大都隱匿不現，卽或露出的，也是遠離﹐低下，渺小，不能同牠並列。而峨眉山以外其他的山呢，就不管你用肉眼，用望遠鏡，你也看不出來，不過在稍爲晴朗的天氣，你也可以望到很遠，甚至看得到山脚，山底下的峨眉縣城，幾十里路以外的岷江，甚至有許多村落都可以看見。頂好還是在夜間。就在夜裏，山頂上也是不大黑的﹐也許是更接近了星光吧。在這半天的空中，是沈默，浩大，彷彿脫離人寰。山下有着無數的明燈，點點滴滴，同天上的星辰一樣。允共在普賢寺，你更看見得很多。俗話說：「萬聲明燈朝普賢。」在白天反而看不見山下的甚麼東西﹐雲霧把下界的一切都同上面隔離了；在夜間　　以下接第五版</p>

Having read the various telegrams of Yu (6th), Yu (7th), and Qi (8th), our admiration is beyond description. National calamities have occurred for several years now, and unity against foreign aggression is the common aspiration. The Central Government, entrusted by the people of the whole country and all comrades of the Party, is working diligently and earnestly at this critical juncture, striving for unity to resist aggression and seek survival. However, the military leaders of the Two Guangdongs, under the pretext of resisting Japan, have mobilized troops and caused disturbances, causing unease throughout the country. This is what those who plot against our country are delighted to see, and what those who love our country are deeply worried about. Your Excellency has witnessed the hidden dangers in your hometown, and your telegram expresses loyal and sincere advice, full of deep meaning, enough to awaken those who are lost in illusions. The people of Guangdong desire what Your Excellency has spoken on their behalf. Our admiration is unparalleled. The Central Government's measures are broad and seek to achieve overall stability. It has convened the Second Plenary Session to seek a proper resolution. Military Commander Wu Qi has come to Nanjing to participate in the Plenary Session, upholding justice, which has caused jubilation throughout the country. We firmly believe that Your Excellency's hope for unity against foreign aggression will be realized in this Plenary Session, which will achieve a proper solution to comfort the people.

<h3 id="e9">At the Second Plenary Session, Foreign Minister Zhang Qun Reported on the Diplomatic Developments of the Past Six Months; Based on Various Observations, There Still Seems to Be Room for Diplomatic Maneuvering; Responsible Authorities of Both Countries Should Adjust Diplomatic Relations Through Proper Channels <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the diplomatic developments of the past six months, this reporter recently learned that Foreign Minister Zhang made a report at the most recent meeting of the Second Plenary Session this morning. It is reported that Foreign Minister Zhang first mentioned the foreign policy determined by the Fifth National Congress, namely that peace will not be abandoned unless it reaches a point of complete hopelessness, and sacrifice will not be lightly spoken of unless it reaches the final moment. Peace has its limits, and beyond these limits, one can only seek survival in sacrifice. For the past six months, the government's foreign policy has consistently adhered to this principle. Secondly, he stated that after assuming the post of Foreign Minister, he immediately advocated that China and Japan should seek to adjust their entire relationship through diplomatic channels. In recent months, the focus of negotiations with the Japanese side has been on this issue of adjustment. He also mentioned Japan's policy towards China and its trends, providing a detailed analysis and comparison between the period of last winter and the present. His conclusion was that the current state of North China is quite unstable due to large-scale smuggling and the unnecessary increase in troops. However, based on various observations, there still seems to be room for diplomatic maneuvering. Foreign Minister Zhang finally expressed his fervent hope that the responsible authorities of China and Japan, for the sake of peace and the future of East Asia, should quickly seek to adjust diplomatic relations between the two countries in a way that benefits both sides through proper channels. At the same time, the people of our country should unite in a united front amidst the efforts to save the nation and ensure its survival, for the sake of the country and the long-term stability of East Asia.

<h3 id="e10">Implementation Rules for the Income Tax Ordinance May Be Completed Next Week <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xianxi Will Make a Statement</p>
<p>To Provide a Detailed Explanation to the People</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office reports that the Provisional Income Tax Ordinance has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and that the implementing regulations for the ordinance are currently being drafted. The regulations are expected to be completed next week and submitted to Minister Kong, who will then forward them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The drafting of these implementing regulations required considerable study because, of the three types of income subject to taxation as stipulated in the ordinance, the procedures for salaries and wages and securities deposits are relatively easy as they can use the source taxation method. However, for business income, which must be calculated based on its net profit, it is necessary to determine what types of expenses are necessary for companies, businesses, firms, factories, and individually owned businesses with capital of over 2,000 yuan, and how to determine their standard amount. The total income of these businesses must be used to deduct these expenses and determine the actual amount of net income. Without proper investigation and statistics beforehand, it is difficult to obtain appropriate results. The Office is currently working hard to complete this arduous task. It is also learned that Kong Xiangxi, at the beginning of the income tax implementation, is deeply concerned that people from all walks of life may not easily understand it, and will make a statement to provide a detailed explanation to the people.

According to Sa Fu Jun, Sa is currently seventy-eight years old, walks with vigor, and is a frequent traveler. This trip to Nanjing is purely because he has not seen Sa for several years, and Sa Fu Jun specifically invited Sa to visit Nanjing. Because Sa has not been to Nanjing for more than ten years, he is using this opportunity to see the sights of the new capital. He plans to stay in Nanjing for several days, and then travel to Qingdao or Guling for a short summer retreat, returning to Fujian after the autumn cools down. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>

<p>Guangdong Authorities Oppose Financial Consolidation</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Hai'an hosted Chinese and foreign journalists in Hong Kong at noon on the 11th. In his remarks, he stated that although the current situation is grave, he was ordered to come south again to preserve the vitality of the 30 million people of Guangdong Province. He was prepared to discuss the overall method of consolidating the economy and finances with the Guangdong authorities with the utmost sincerity. After arriving in Guangdong, he met with Chen Jitang, Lin Yunjie, Ou Fangpu, etc. To his surprise, the existing reserves in Guangdong Province amounted to only 90 million yuan, while the issued banknotes reached over 230 million yuan. This was a significant discrepancy compared to the required 60% cash reserve for banknotes. Furthermore, there were rumors that these 90 million yuan in reserves would be sold to a certain country. Investigations revealed that 10 million yuan had already flowed out of the province. Should an unfortunate event occur in the future, Guangdong's banknotes would become worthless paper, and the 90 million yuan of silver belonging to the 30 million people of Guangdong would fall into the hands of a certain country, fundamentally collapsing the economic foundation of the entire province. The Guangdong Province had requested the central government to provide 20 million yuan in national currency to stabilize Guangdong's foreign exchange. The central government ordered the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to allocate the funds accordingly, but required Guangdong Province to use the existing silver as a reserve to prevent it from flowing out of the country, and to establish a central branch in Guangdong to consolidate finances. To alleviate the suffering of the people of Guangdong, the central government was willing to make concessions, but the responsible authorities in Guangdong firmly opposed this, for their own selfish gains. Therefore, despite having a concrete plan and discussing it with them openly, there was no result, which is regrettable. He had to leave Guangdong for Hong Kong and wait to return north to report his mission. Tang Shoumin and Bei Zuyi have therefore decided not to come south. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong authorities continue to print banknotes and collect silver from the people. On the 10th, 150 boxes of newly printed banknotes, worth approximately 7.2 million yuan, were shipped from abroad via the United States. Another 40 million yuan will be shipped in the coming days.

The other defendants, Han Shijie, Wu Kangnian, and Zhang Hong, were all questioned and gave mostly evasive testimony. The court ordered a review of the accounts and adjourned for a later hearing. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Pharmacist Sun Hao accused Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health and concurrently Director of the Central Hospital, of embezzlement to the Procuratorate of the Capital District Court. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution, the Capital District Court publicly heard the case at 7:00 AM on the 11th in the criminal court of the court. At 8:00 AM, Presiding Judge Gao Weijun, Judges Deng Baosun and Li Wenwei, Prosecutor Zhang Weidong, and Clerk Tu Huaile entered the court in order. The defendant's lawyers also entered the court in succession. The defendant, Liu Ruiheng, was absent due to official business. The other defendants, Tao Shijie, Wu Kangnian, Zhang Hongxu, and others entered the court. The Clerk read aloud the cause of action and opened the court. Then, the Presiding Judge questioned each defendant about their name, age, occupation, and address. Then, the prosecutor stated the main points of the prosecution in this case, stating that this case was based on the facts listed by Sun Hao in his complaint, which was investigated according to law. The prosecutor believed that the defendants were indeed suspected of committing a crime, that the defendants jointly and continuously embezzled funds from the Central Hospital in their business, and that the defendants were co-conspirators in the crime of Article 56 and Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Liu continuously occupied and embezzled public funds from the Department of Health and committed the act of using altered official documents. His crimes were committed during the effective period of the old criminal law, and Old Criminal Law Article 357, Paragraph 1, Article 233, Paragraph 1, and Article 75 and Article 74 should be applied. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1, and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law. After the prosecutor finished stating the main points, the Presiding Judge questioned the three defendants, Tao, Wu, and Zhang, about whether they had committed crimes before. Then, he questioned them one by one. According to Tao Shijie's confession, he entered the hospital in August of the 20th year and left in August of the 22nd year, serving as the Director of General Affairs, succeeding Liu Chongjie. The Central Hospital was built during my tenure, and the construction funds were donated by Hu Wenhu, 370,000 from the Health Experiment Institute. The funds retained in the monthly report under the name of patient food. The purpose of retaining funds because Central Hospital construction requires money, the deceased accountant supervisor Liu Chongde set up this method, discussed with me, and obtained the permission of the dean. The number of retention is not detailed. I also borrowed money from the Health Experiment Institute, but the loan was signed by Liu, the former accountant supervisor, and obtained the dean's approval, but there was a lot of money, I was busy, and did not look at the accounts, so I did not know. As for Sun Lianzhong's donation of special nurse fees, I don't know. The Presiding Judge asked if you remember the two batches of funds that were not reported for the first and second times. He answered that it was not clear. The Presiding Judge immediately prompted that from May to November of the 19th year, the income from miscellaneous fees was 460 yuan and 0.02 points, and in the 20th year, the same amount was 1,250 yuan and 9.7 points, and Sun Lianzhong's donation of 1,000 yuan, totaling 2,250 yuan and 0.097 points, were not reported. Were these funds used for engineering fees? He also asked if these two accounts were set up. He answered yes, you can ask the accountant, and I also reported to the dean, with his permission. Asked who took over after you left the Central Hospital, he answered that after leaving the Central Hospital, I went to the Health Department to work in general affairs, and Wu Kangnian took over. I don't know if the Health Department has dormitories. I don't know if the electricity, telephone, and rent for the Director of the Health Department's residence are paid by the Health Department. The Presiding Judge continued to question Wu Kangnian, Zhang Hongxu, and others about the details of the funds being used and stored. Then, witnesses Sun Hongxing, Zhao Zhongyi, Ding Kaoliang, and Ma Enji were summoned and questioned one by one. The Presiding Judge then said that Zhang Hongxu requested an audit, but according to this court, there is no dispute over the funds now, so what is the need to audit? Zhang replied that the audit was the dean's intention, and I have no opinion. Then, he asked Wu and Tao if there were any matters to be investigated, and they both answered no. Then, the Clerk read the record, and the Presiding Judge ordered that the defendant in this case was not all present today, and the accounts must be audited, so the hearing will be postponed to a later date.

<h3 id="e38">After the Lifting of Sanctions Against Italy <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations has decided to lift the sanctions against Italy on the 15th. The Italo-Ethiopian issue, which has been troubled for a long time, has come to an end lightly. We still remember that at the League of Nations General Assembly last October, the fifty member states unanimously and righteously resolved to impose sanctions on Italy's violation of Article 12 of the Covenant. Subsequently, the League of Nations organized a special committee to supervise the implementation of sanctions against Italy by various member states. Unexpectedly, after only nine months, Italy annexed Abyssinia. Not only could the League of Nations not guarantee the provisions of the covenant for the territorial integrity of member states, it even lifted the only nominal sanction.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, the League of Nations Covenant has long been equivalent to a dead letter. Therefore, when the League of Nations launched economic sanctions against Italy last year, most people felt that this was a "barely satisfactory" move. However, after the sanctions were implemented, because Austria-Hungary and Albania had joined the Laval cabinet and wanted to control Germany through Italy, they were unwilling to seriously implement the sanctions. The power of sanctions had already been greatly weakened. Most recently, when Mussolini annexed Abyssinia with high spirits, he frequently threatened Germany with kinship and used the lifting of sanctions as a condition for returning to the League of Nations. At the same time, the United Kingdom, in view of the increasing crisis in the Near East and in order to ease the tense situation in the Mediterranean, felt that it was necessary to win over Italy. It was willing to compromise with Italy and use most of its strength to deal with these "annoying" issues. Therefore, it was determined to advocate for the lifting of sanctions against Italy. The French Popular Front cabinet, fearing the combination of Italy and Germany, did not dare to antagonize Italy and agreed to the British proposal. Under such relationship constraints, the League of Nations inevitably sacrificed its own prestige and Abyssinia to please the aggressor.</p>
<p>However, has sacrificing the prestige of the League of Nations and lifting the sanctions against Italy brought any benefit to the improvement of the European situation? Absolutely not. On the contrary, it has only fueled the arrogance of the aggressor. We can see this clearly by simply looking at the facts of the past few days. First, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries originally thought that after the sanctions were lifted, Italy could return to the international cooperation organization. However, despite the concessions made by the United Kingdom and France, Italy decided to withdraw its Mediterranean fleet and the Mediterranean mutual assistance plan failed. Italy still holds a wait-and-see attitude towards international cooperation. Second, the active activities of the German National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig and the roar of Greiser, Chairman of the Danzig Senate, at the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, have already been discussed in this newspaper. According to a National News Agency dispatch, the Danzig authorities formally announced their secession from the League of Nations on the 7th, and it is widely rumored that there may be a compromise between Germany and Poland. Third, according to a National News Agency dispatch, Germany is currently uniting Austria, southern and Hungary to carry out the decomposition of the Soviet Union and plans to promote the construction of an independent Ukrainian government. This is the prelude to the storm in Eastern Europe. Fourth, the combination of Italy and Germany has seen progress since the conclusion of the aviation agreement. Recently, it has been widely rumored that Germany and Austria will establish an agreement in which Germany guarantees the integrity of Austria. In this way, the contradictions between Italy and Germany over Austria may be temporarily eased. In short, the League of Nations' decision to lift the sanctions against Italy has given the aggressor a powerful encouragement. Not only will the situation in Europe become increasingly precarious, but its impact on the Far East is also very serious. Under the flash of swords and shadows, the peace hall of Geneva has indeed become bleak.</p>

<p>Germany Willing to Respect Austrian Independence, Austrian Prime Minister to Meet with Hitler, Czechoslovakia Expresses Difficulty in Drawing Conclusions</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuters correspondents in Berlin and Vienna, Germany and Austria are expected to issue an important announcement soon regarding improving their relations. Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg will deliver a radio address in Vienna tonight. Sources in Vienna confirm that Schuschnigg will make a declaration stating Germany's willingness to respect Austrian independence, the disbanding of Austrian legionnaires in Germany, the cessation of Nazi Party propaganda activities in Austria, the abolition of the 1,000-mark tax levied on German tourists entering Austria, the free crossing of borders for Austrians, and the allowance of Austrian Nazi Party members to join the Austrian "Fatherland Front." Schuschnigg is unlikely to mention the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, as it is not currently feasible. However, Germany will announce that, in principle, it does not oppose the restoration of the Austrian monarchy. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Tonight, Vienna and Berlin will both broadcast speeches declaring that Germany and Austria have reached a friendly agreement. It is widely believed that Mussolini played a significant role in this. This compromise could greatly change the situation in Europe. Most surprisingly, earlier reports suggested pessimism regarding a compromise. The final talks at Hitler's villa, attended by the German Ambassador to Austria, Papen, Foreign Minister Neurath, and General Ribbentrop, are said to have taken place. It is rumored that Hitler and Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg will meet in Germany early next month, likely at Hitler's villa. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) It was learned today that German Ambassador to Austria, Papen, has reached an agreement with Prime Minister Schuschnigg and has promptly returned to report to Führer Hitler. This agreement not only ends the years of discord between Germany and Austria but also serves as a bridge for German-Italian unity, potentially forming a German-Italian-Austrian bloc, which would have a significant impact on the future of Europe. As for the content of the agreement, Prime Minister Schuschnigg will announce it to the Austrian Parliament, and Führer Hitler will announce it in a speech around the 29th of this month in Germany. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) German Ambassador Papen traveled to Berchtesgaden in Bavaria yesterday to meet with Führer Hitler. He returned here this morning. It is generally believed that the results of the German-Austrian talks will be announced soon. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Regarding the compromise between Germany and Austria, political figures recently stated that the negotiations have made great progress. Informed sources also said that Berlin and Vienna will soon issue a communiqué to demonstrate that relations have returned to normal. However, the outcome of Prime Minister Schuschnigg's talks with German Ambassador Papen may not result in a formal political treaty but rather a "gentleman's agreement." The key points are: 1. Germany agrees to respect Austrian independence. 2. Discussions will be held on various issues to establish good relations between the two countries. The first point is considered to have a significant impact on the overall European situation, meaning that Germany will not interfere in Austria's internal political, legal, and administrative affairs. The Austrian Nazi Party will also be considered an illegal rebellious party, based on Prime Minister Schuschnigg's speech on June 9th. Observers believe that Austria's future relationship with Germany will be similar to Austria's relationship with Soviet Russia, meaning that both the Nazi Party and the Communist Party will be banned. The second point of the agreement will include trade, sports, and tourism matters. Furthermore, there have been rumors of a cabinet reshuffle in Austria to please Germany. Although Austrian authorities have repeatedly denied this, observers believe that a non-Nazi, pro-German figure may join the Austrian cabinet to demonstrate good relations. (Agence Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Prague: Responsible figures are closely monitoring the negotiations between German and Austrian authorities, believing that it would be good if foreign interference in Austrian internal affairs could be prevented for a long time after Germany and Austria reach an agreement. As it stands, Austrian independence may not be destroyed, but the impact of the German-Austrian agreement on Austrian internal affairs remains uncertain. It is too early to draw a conclusion on this agreement. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) The Liberal Party's newspaper, the News Chronicle, recently reported that it has obtained a secret plan for Germany's large-scale military reorganization. Key points: 1. An underground aircraft hangar is being built near the port of Hamburg in Fuhlsbüttel. All the sheds are hidden to prevent outside observation. It can accommodate 200 military aircraft and 400 pilots. 2. The aircraft factories in the port of Hamburg are very large and can produce nine aircraft per week. 3. Twelve airfields are being built in Lüneburg, six of which are underground. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e44">What Is Hitler Doing, Deep in the Gardens? <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Is He Studying a Diplomatic Declaration? German Figures Advocate a Five-Power Conference</p>
<p>(London) The secrets of Hitler's villa in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, with its lush gardens, are eagerly sought by European authorities and secret intelligence agencies. It is widely believed that Hitler is currently secluded in the villa, studying a diplomatic policy declaration, which will likely be issued before the Locarno Conference and the opening of the World Sports Games. The German Nazi Party intends to highlight Germany's love of peace and the affluence of German life at the World Sports Games. Germans now feel that there are only two ways to resolve the situation: one is to convene a meeting of the signatories of the Locarno Pact and conclude a new pact based on Hitler's proposed peace plan; the other is to start anew. The German government now believes that neither Britain nor Italy agrees to a four-nation alliance of Britain, Italy, France, and Belgium to oppose Germany, which is a one-sided solution based on the meaning of the Locarno agreement in March of this year. However, some people in France strongly desire this alliance. Germany believes that France is now afraid that Italy and Germany are on the same front on the issue of reforming the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Another factor that causes concern among European authorities is the future of German-Austrian relations. However, according to sources in Vienna, Germany and Austria have not yet reached an agreement. Recent talks between the two countries seem to have broken down because Hitler refused to give concrete recognition to Austrian independence. However, these talks will continue in the fall. German diplomacy has recently suffered a setback due to the reckless behavior of Greiser, the President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, at the League of Nations Council meeting, which has created a bad impression on the world, as even Germany's friendly country, Poland, is displeased. Within 24 hours of Greiser's outburst at the meeting, the German Propaganda Ministry ordered newspapers not to praise him, indicating that the German authorities were uneasy.</p>
<p>The dispute between Britain and Russia at the Montreux Conference is also of great concern to the general public, and Italy's exclusive support for Britain and rejection of Russia, expressing sympathy for British policy, is the first time in many months. Italy opposes Russia's plan because the Soviet fleet can sail from the Black Sea to interfere in the Mediterranean, and after the event, sail back without being pursued. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland stated in the Chamber of Representatives yesterday, "Our neighboring countries have powerful military forces, and we are currently under direct threat. Gentlemen, you must not forget this. I believe that the calamity of war is not necessarily unavoidable, but to achieve this goal, the League of Nations covenant must be amended at the general meeting in September." Members of Parliament in the lobby of the Chamber of Representatives were deeply impressed by this statement. It is reported that the Chamber of Representatives Military Affairs Committee is also intensifying the drafting of a national defense plan, one of which advocates extending the period of compulsory military service.

<h3 id="e45">Britain Builds New Fleet <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Its Strength Is Sufficient to Fight Anywhere, First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare Says It Is a Matter of Life and Death</p>
<p>(London) Sir Samuel Hoare said in Southampton today that Britain will have a new fleet whose strength will enable it to go anywhere and fulfill its responsibilities in any situation. The new fleet should be built along the right lines, and this is a matter of life and death for Britain. Efforts will be made to utilize the lessons learned from practical experience and scientific inventions. The entire nation should know that the existence of Britain and the Empire depends on maritime power. If our ocean communications are cut off, our supply of raw materials will only last for three months. However, the supply of raw materials must be more than we need, as we will starve in less than six weeks. Hoare praised Prime Minister Baldwin's political abilities, saying that he was far superior to those who advocate pacifism and was truly the representative of Britain's peace forces. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that the Foreign Office and the Admiralty have drafted a note based on the "Escalator Clause" of the 1930 Naval Treaty to request the United States and Japan to agree to Britain retaining 40,000 tons of destroyers beyond the treaty limit. Britain has also informed France and Italy of this intention. Britain sent a note to the United States and Japan on May 6th, hoping to resolve the issue of retaining excess tonnage through friendly negotiations, but the United States advocates that Britain formally invoke the "Escalator Clause" in the 1930 Naval Treaty. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the British government's intention to invoke Article 21, the "Escalator Clause," of the London Naval Treaty so that the country's destroyers can maintain their original number of 190,000 tons, naval figures revealed that it was possible after the Morning Post reported on it. However, political figures said that no decision had been made so far. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Italy and Germany Praise Each Other</p>
<p>(London) The Locarno Conference has been scheduled to be held in the capital of Belgium on the 22nd of this month. It is rumored that the British government ordered its ambassador to Belgium, Wigram, to suggest to the Belgian Prime Minister, Paul van Zeeland, that the countries concerned should jointly issue a declaration before the meeting stating that although the ultimate goal of the conference is to resolve international disputes, the immediate task is to promote a mutual assistance pact in Western Europe and to promote Germany's return to the League of Nations. Official figures here solemnly denied that the British government had suggested inviting Germany to participate in the Locarno Conference immediately, saying that this issue may be discussed at the meeting, but it must be discussed if Germany provides a timely answer to the British question. If Germany has not yet submitted a reply by then, the Locarno Conference will examine the situation caused by the country's refusal to reply. Official figures also said that according to news from Berlin, the German government may not submit an answer as soon as possible. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, it is now known that Ambassador Wigram visited Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland on the 8th of this month, suggesting that the countries should jointly issue a declaration before the meeting stating that although the ultimate goal of this meeting is to resolve international disputes, dispel suspicion, and make peace, the immediate task is to promote a mutual assistance pact in Western Europe and to enable Germany to re-enter the League of Nations. Prime Minister van Zeeland is currently discussing this suggestion with the French government and has not yet submitted a reply. According to diplomatic figures, after receiving the Belgian notification, the French government warned the British government that the British proposal may be misinterpreted by Berlin as an acknowledgment by the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact of Germany's occupation of the Rhineland. The French government believes that Germany must first sincerely promise to respect the international rule of law before it can be acknowledged. It is generally expected that once Foreign Secretary Eden returns from vacation early next week, Britain, France, and Belgium will continue to negotiate on this issue. (Agence Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Belgian Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland, in his capacity as convener of the Locarno Conference, sent an invitation to the Italian government, inviting it to send representatives to participate. Italy has not yet submitted a response. Political figures believe that Italy's willingness to send representatives will depend on the attitude of Britain, France, and Belgium towards Germany, as well as Germany's attitude towards the conference. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) As sanctions are about to be lifted today in Italy, Britain has withdrawn its main fleet stationed in the Mediterranean to its original defense area, and the Mediterranean mutual assistance plan initiated by Britain has also been declared abolished by France. Therefore, it is preparing to participate in restoring the balance of power in Europe. The Rome correspondent of Le Petit Parisien reported today that Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed his willingness to send representatives to attend the Locarno Conference held in Brussels. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources here announced today that although France has declared to Britain that the Anglo-French mutual assistance agreement in the Mediterranean will be abolished on July 15 when the League of Nations lifts sanctions against Italy, the mutual assistance agreements concluded with Britain by other countries such as Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece will remain in effect. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A correspondent from Le Petit Parisien reported from Rome that the Italian authorities were very satisfied after the French government announced that the mutual assistance measures previously agreed upon by Britain and France due to the situation in the Mediterranean would be invalidated. However, diplomatic figures believe that Italy may have accepted certain constraints on Germany and therefore cannot change its diplomatic policy. The current situation is still chaotic and subtle. It is generally not denied that renowned journalist Pertinax published an article in L'Echo de Paris, stating, "The French government announced that the mutual assistance measures previously agreed upon by Britain and France would be invalidated because Britain had previously concluded mutual assistance agreements in the Mediterranean with Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece." However, British semi-official figures believe that this mutual assistance agreement should be regarded as the core of a future Mediterranean convention and can become a tool for safeguarding peace in the Mediterranean. The British side has no intention of announcing its invalidation. (Agence Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Britain is the opposite of the United States. The weather has been cool and rainy for consecutive days, causing great inconvenience to vacationers. All ball games have been stopped. There was a strong wind and rain in Eastbourne yesterday morning, with thunder rumbling like artillery fire, preceded by hailstones as large as stone bullets, accumulating to a depth of two inches. Hundreds of households were flooded and asked the fire department to pump out the water. Dozens of stores on Main Street were flooded, and goods flowed out of broken windows. As a cruise ship was approaching the dock, its mast touched an electric wire and broke. Captain Smith and a wireless telegraph operator were knocked down and suffered burns to their heads and necks. However, most of the passengers were in their cabins at the time, so they were not injured and most did not know that the mast had touched an electric wire. Shortly after, London and other places experienced heavy rain and hail. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>Churchill Strongly Criticizes</p>
<p>(London) When the German zeppelin Hindenburg flew back to Germany from the United States a few days ago, it temporarily changed its route, citing weather reasons, and flew over the major industrial areas of northern Britain. Churchill, a member of parliament from the extreme conservative party, gave a speech in Chingdon, addressing this matter and strongly criticizing it, stating, "If a British aircraft, in clear weather, changes its route under the pretext of bad weather and flies over the German Heligoland, the Kiel Canal, or the newly built fortifications along the Rhine, what would Germany do? Predictably, its attitude would not be just a weak protest, like the bleating of a lamb, as we have done." Churchill then exposed the situation of Britain's inadequate military equipment, saying, "Last year, Germany's military spending was over £800 million, and this year it is even more than that. As far as I can see, we still need to make more efforts to ensure that our country's military spending does not appear to be inferior." (Agence Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Cabinet Coordinator and Minister of National Defense Daladier recently made a declaration to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, explaining the motives behind the government's proposed nationalization of the arms industry. He stated that the main motives for the proposal are threefold: to strengthen national defense, to prepare for industrial mobilization, and to exert a spiritual influence on foreign countries, thereby demonstrating the French government's firm will to permanently oversee armaments. Daladier also stated that the government's proposed bill is for nationalization, not a state monopoly, and that the government intends to nationalize only certain specific industries. The initial cost of implementation is estimated to be around 1 billion francs. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) During a recent meeting of the French Chamber of Deputies, right-wing member Grillis questioned Minister of Aviation Cot regarding the Aviation Ministry's supply of new-style machine guns for aircraft to Soviet Russia. After Cot's response, military circles here have paid great attention to the matter. Observers also stated that political figures were surprised by Minister Cot's statement that "no military alliance treaty exists between France and Russia." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon hearing Minister Cot's declaration, expressed considerable optimism, stating that once the sanctions against Italy are decided to be lifted, the French government will end the previously agreed-upon Mediterranean mutual aid measures, which is commendable. It was also stated that "the French government now understands Italy's mindset and cannot accuse it of lacking sincerity towards Germany," and so on. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of the Interior Salengro made a declaration in the Senate a few days ago, stating that the occupation of factories by striking workers must be stopped in the future. This declaration has recently been put into practice. A labor dispute occurred at the "Louis Lebeaudt Textile Factory" in this city several weeks ago. After negotiations between the factory and the striking workers, the majority of the workers, numbering over 750 men and women, have expressed acceptance of the terms for returning to work. However, a small group of approximately 100 people are still occupying the factory and refusing to return to work. The factory has strictly requested the local authorities to comply with the Minister of the Interior's declaration and provide assistance in ordering the striking workers to leave the factory. (Ginwas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Avignon, France A disturbance occurred here today. A group of merchants, farmers, and small business owners marched to the city hall, singing the Marseillaise along the way. Another group of striking workers sang the Internationale and attacked the merchants. Several people on both sides sustained minor injuries. Police arrived and arrested six people. Subsequently, several people sang the Internationale, smashed the glass windows of a grocery store, and broke into the store to loot it before fleeing. The situation throughout the city is currently tense. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the conflict between striking workers and merchants in Avignon, the Communist Party issued a public statement expressing regret, stating that the victory of the left-wing People's Front was due to the unity of the middle class and the working class. The events in Avignon are causing these two classes to be divided, which is regrettable. The main purpose of the People's Front is to protect the interests of both the working class and the middle class. In terms of the interests of the working class, improper actions should not be taken against the middle class, as there is a need for unity between these two classes. Otherwise, the strength of the people will be weakened by division, and the enemy of the people will inevitably take advantage of the opportunity to carry out their schemes, which is not what we want to see.

It stated that "the determination of the left-wing parties to implement the People's Front program is unshakable. Although these parties have a unified relationship with the working class, it is also essential to maintain public order. If strikers occupy factories indefinitely, the result will inevitably be the destruction of public order. There are currently some people spreading messages, exaggerating the labor movement, and the people should not easily believe them. As for the working class, if they take drastic actions, they may lose the sympathy of public opinion, which should be avoided." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Spain in Turmoil <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Spanish peasants are the victims of a semi-feudal landlord system. In Spain, countless vestiges of feudalism and feudal psychology remain. Agricultural technology is as antiquated as in the days of Tsarist Russia, and production standards are extremely low. Profits are rarely reinvested; landlords lack confidence in their own future. The trouble with Spain is in the lazy rich and the lazy poor. I once visited a landlord who also served as a senior official in the local landlord association. As he spoke to me in a cafe, his head was turned elsewhere, and for the first fifteen minutes of our discussion, I carefully guarded against him. He felt that his class was advancing. He said, "I firmly believe that there is no way to improve agriculture except through irrigation" (in other words, this has nothing to do with the landlord). "Before the spread of socialism, the farmers, though dissatisfied, lived happily. The farmers are born in the fields and are accustomed to hard work. Although he feels that the wages are insufficient, he does not know what life improvement is. Wages are indeed miserable, but there is no possibility of increasing them now. Since 1931 (since the establishment of the Republic), agriculture has become unprofitable due to the rise in wages and the fall in prices. We are suffering from overproduction" (many Spaniards are starving to death).</p>
<p>"According to the actual will of mankind," he said automatically, "the problem of Spain is very easy to solve." I asked him to be more specific, but he only mentioned a few more nouns. Another manager of the Countess of Adanero's estate, which owns 50,000 hectares of land, also expressed the same sentiment.</p>
<p>The Spanish landlord class, which controls the lives of 80 percent of the population, will never solve the land problem (but this is the main problem in Spain), because it cannot solve it. Because farmers have no purchasing power. Therefore, various industries cannot develop. Spain lacks everything, and the number of unemployed in the cities alone has reached 700,000. People have very little money, very little consumption power, and therefore the national economy can only decline.</p>
<p>How does Azaña cope with this situation? He admits that this is a serious problem that needs urgent relief. To date, he has done this: forcibly leasing land to "Yunteros." In the worst-hit province of Cáceres, Señor de la Fuente, representative of the Land Reform Commission, issued a statement on March 7 demanding that landlords lease land to "Yunteros," but no one responded or compromised. Then the farmers submitted an "ultimatum": "If you don't give us land, we will occupy it within 48 hours!" On March 12, the farming area established by the Yunteros on the large estate began. Since then, 24,702 Yunteros in Cáceres have leased 69,612 hectares of land. But these lands are not confiscated or bought, and the Yunteros only become half-harvest shareholders. In this arid farming area, 30 to 35 hectares of land are required to support a family, while the Yunteros now receive an average of three hectares per household. A few people used to own some land, but these people are few and far between, and the old and new lands are often separated. Some Yunteros have to ride mules for five hours a day to get to the place where they cultivate. In Badajoz, the Land Reform Commission tried its best to promote the second province. On the evening of March 25, the farmers simply occupied the land, cultivated it automatically, and asked the commission to recognize their actions as legal—which was achieved. Here, the "Yunteros" can now also lease land. 45,000 Yunteros in Badajoz were allowed 12,000 hectares, an average of less than three hectares per person. Land reform is being promoted more or less everywhere, and will continue. Azaña once said to me, "When 500,000 farmers get land, this problem can be solved." Azaña also said that he hoped to confiscate the land of large landlords without compensation under the laws that had stopped several years ago. He will also allow the restoration of collective ownership of village land, which had been collective pastures ten years ago.</p>
<p>No one dares to say whether the Spanish peasant will finally enjoy his inadequate land. Minister of Agriculture Ruiz-Funeg told me, "This is a difficult problem." That's right. But this must be solved one day, the later the time, the more difficult it will be. At present, the Yunteros are still poor half-harvesters. Azaña said in my visit that land reform will strengthen the power of the urban bourgeoisie, but he doesn't care about this, because the bourgeoisie is not anti-Republican. But who can benefit from land reform after all? Maybe when land reform is completed, farmers can get a little benefit. But it can only be said that they can get some nourishment. This does not mean that he can become an active consumer of urban goods, which is inevitable. Should land reform be seen as a way to prosper Spanish cities and revitalize new industries? To do this, Azaña's plan is too narrow.</p>
<p>A subordinate of Azaña told me that land reform can weaken the power of the Socialist Party. It may have suppressed revolutionary enthusiasm. In my 2,000 kilometer car journey, the twenty Yunteros made it clear that they were satisfied with the land reform: although they also felt that it was still hopeless and unsuitable for them. The misery of Spanish farmers is imaginable. Only this minimum of attention and assistance has made them very grateful.</p>
<p>Therefore, Azaña's land reform may save Azaña himself, but he is also a giant who cannot be satisfied with this alone. His land reform will not save Spain. Now the Spanish resistance movement is practicing a promise of a class to seize power, so that the achievements of this class in Spain are the same as what the bourgeoisie has done in other countries—and then develop to a higher stage, but land reform weakens the power of this protest movement by partially comforting the rural unrest. It is sad that this is the case. If the peasants are satisfied with the current land reform, the implementation of the solutions that Spain needs will inevitably weaken the impetus politically.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting point: Azaña's reforms also weaken the landlord class. They are deprived of effective control over their property (unless the original reactionary politics are restored). Suppose this situation continues. Suppose that after three or two years, the farmers feel more dissatisfied with Azaña's moderate policies. Assuming they make the final demand for the confiscation and collectivization of all property, does the Spanish bourgeoisie have the power to resist? Perhaps Spain can democratically decide an economic revolution without a civil war. I don't know.</p>
<p>At the same time, the trend of agricultural collectivization is growing. I visited two collective villages. There are many more—all organized spontaneously by the farmers. They do not know the Soviet collective farms (Kolkozi). Fu De and Montojo (Jorge Montojo), the separate responsible persons for land reform in Cáceres and Badajoz, both felt that their institutions were inappropriate. They both saw the wisdom of broadcasting collectivization throughout Spain, especially in dry farming. Spanish law restricts the use of machinery in agriculture. The large-scale use of machinery for dry farming will inevitably give the Spanish countryside a new look. The landlords are unwilling to use it. Farmers are unable to do it personally. Collectivization is the most logical method. "But Spanish farmers are individualists," Ruiz-Funeg argued. I have heard this statement from many sources. I do not believe that extreme poverty is compatible with individualism. The individualist who has endured decades of poverty will inevitably agree to a collective system that can make him rich.</p>
<p>Lurgo Caba lero, the most popular leader of the left-wing Socialist Party—most of the farmers are left-wing socialists—told me that he did not believe that Azaña could implement collectivization. The Communist Party also holds the same view. They are afraid that the political situation may turn to the right again due to the conservative Lerroux and the reactionary Robles' attacks on Azaña's left-wing Republican Party. Will Azaña be destroyed by his party members? If so, then if the masses oppose his policies again, the crisis of giving the reactionaries a chance to rise may occur. Or the masses will support the Communist Party and Caballero (he told me that there is not much difference between him and the Communist Party) to continue Azaña's failed cause, but unless the right-wing comes up with a coup, this situation cannot happen immediately. The so-called "immediately" means at least a year.</p>

<p>Air Defense Bonds Rescheduled for October, Water Conservancy Bonds for Seven Million to be Issued in September</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Government recently decided to issue two types of public bonds and has stepped up preparations. One is air defense bonds, which have a mandatory sales aspect. All men and women in cities, counties, and villages over the age of twenty must subscribe to bonds worth two jiao per person, collected in two installments, meaning each person must bear four jiao. Each county and city will establish a bond collection committee to be responsible for collecting the funds. The first installment was originally scheduled to begin on June 1, but due to insufficient preparation, it is proposed to reschedule it for October 1. The other is that the Guangdong government, in order to develop water conservancy and promote agriculture in the province, planned to issue water conservancy bonds last year to build water conservancy projects in various jurisdictions and repair various weirs. Later, it was decided to first issue seven million water conservancy bonds to repair the base weirs in the Pearl River Delta region. These bonds are to be divided into four denominations: ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. Bonds with a face value of one thousand yuan account for one million yuan, bonds with a face value of one hundred yuan account for two million yuan, bonds with a face value of fifty yuan account for two million yuan, and bonds with a face value of ten yuan account for two million yuan. It is expected to be printed by the end of next month and will begin to be issued in September in order to collect funds and start construction in the autumn. The regulations for the issuance of Class A water conservancy bonds were revised by the provincial government yesterday as follows: Article 1: The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to develop water conservancy in this province, specially allows the industrial and tenant groups in various jurisdictions to issue Class A rural construction bonds of Guangdong Province in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Article 2: The total amount of this bond is set at seven million silver legal currency of Guangdong Province, of which five million yuan will be used for the construction of base weirs in the Pearl River Delta region, and two million yuan will be used for the construction of water conservancy projects outside the Pearl River Delta region in this province, and shall not be used for other purposes. Article 3: The face value of this bond is set at four types: one thousand yuan, one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and ten yuan. Article 4: The interest rate of this bond is set at one cent and two li per week, and interest will be paid once each at the end of January and July each year. Article 5: This bond is issued by the local water conservancy cooperative, and the government is responsible for paying interest and principal, and the government subsidizes one-sixth of the interest. Interest will only be paid during the period from the date of issuance to the date of completion of the project. One year after the date of benefit from the second construction after the completion of the project, the principal will be repaid, and it will be cleared by lottery ten times. One-tenth of the total amount will be drawn each time. The amount of interest and principal to be paid each time, whether the project is not completed or after it is completed, shall be drawn by the cooperative from the benefiting fields in advance by six months and deposited in the Guangdong Provincial Bank to prepare for the payment of interest and principal when due. Article 6: The payment of interest and principal of this provincial bond is guaranteed by the income from the fields. For example, after a base weir is to be built in a certain place, the local industry and tenants will set up a water conservancy cooperative in a certain place and submit a request to the government to issue bonds. The income from the fields in the weir will be used as a guarantee. The cooperative will be responsible for receiving the bonds, raising funds, building the base weir, and collecting the funds to be apportioned from the fields in the weir, and will be responsible for repaying the principal and interest of the bonds. Article 7: If this provincial bond cannot be repaid on time due to natural disasters or other irresistible failures, the government will designate the treasury tax revenue as the second guarantee and be responsible for the repayment. However, the government will still order the cooperative to recover the repaid funds from the income of the fields in installments until the debt is cleared. When necessary, the cooperative may apply to auction or lease the fields with outstanding debts to offset the repaid funds. Article 8: This bond is issued by the person in charge of the water conservancy cooperative that receives and issues the bond and is guaranteed by the Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance. Article 9: The matters concerning the payment of interest and principal of this bond may be handled by the cooperative that issues the bond after submitting an application to the Department of Finance for approval and entrusting it to the Guangdong Provincial Bank. Article 10: This bond is an un-registered type and can be freely bought and sold and can be used as a reserve for bank guarantees and other public guarantees and collateral. Article 11: Any act of forging this bond and damaging its credit shall be punished according to law. Article 12: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (July 6)</p>

<h3 id="e76">North China Smuggled Goods Shift to Jiangsu and Anhui <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Crackdown on Ronin is an Illusion, Smuggling Adopts Water and Land Liaison Method, Aiming to Open Up New Sales Markets in the South</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin and the Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin have recently cracked down on smuggling and Japanese and Korean ronin participating in various organizations. Among them, the Japanese military department is particularly concerned about smuggling ronin groups such as trade associations. They have warned them not to obstruct traffic. If they have to use the railway, they must pay according to regulations. The Japanese Consulate General summoned the chairman of the Korean Association to instruct him to tell the Koreans that those engaged in special trade (i.e., smuggling) must seek safe transportation methods. If they rely on group organizations to force transportation agencies to carry goods, it is easy to cause Chinese-Japanese animosity. It will absolutely not be allowed in the future. The consulate also ordered the police chief, Kazukui, to be responsible for the investigation and prohibition. This move by the Japanese seems to be quite satisfactory in the midst of rampant smuggling in North China. However, according to the investigation, the Japanese military department and the Japanese Consulate General are only feigning, showing us verbal benefits, because the clarification of the North China political power that the Japanese have been expecting recently is being urged from all sides, forcing its realization. However, because rampant smuggling affects North China's tax revenue, they are worried that this will hinder the implementation of North China's new plans, so they have repeatedly declared that they will crack down on illegal ronin and smuggling groups. In the past week, they have expelled eighteen Koreans and seven Japanese to their home countries to show their determination. In fact, those who were expelled just exited through Tanggu and then returned from Yu Guan. It's just a trick. The smuggling situation at Tianjin East Station is still the same as before.</p>
<p>In the past half month, the goods smuggled southward from Tianjin have not been as many as before. On average, about 180 to 200 pieces of artificial silk and about 80 to 130 companions of sugar are transported southward on the Tianjin-Pukou Train No. 305 every night. In addition, there are needles, printed matter, cigarette paper, and beer. The reason for the decrease is that too many smuggled goods are stored in Tianjin, and the prices have fallen, and there is no market. At the same time, smuggled goods are also flooding Jinan, and sales are too slow. The goods are transported there and piled up like in Tianjin. South of Xuzhou, the inspection is strict, and low-taxed Japanese goods cannot be transported there. Because goods are piled up in Tianjin, it indirectly affects the promotion of smuggled goods in Dalian and eastern Hebei. It is said that Dalian currently has 50,000 bags of sugar, which are expected to be transported and sold after half a year. About 2 million pieces of artificial silk are stored in the coastal areas of Qinhuangdao, Nandaisi, and Beidaihe in eastern Hebei. Although each storage place has iron-tiled warehouses, the rainy season is coming. If there is rainy weather, the iron-tiled warehouses cannot cover them. The goods do not have to be damaged by rain leaks, and the evaporation of ground moisture is enough to cause mildew and rot. Therefore, the smuggling ronin are working hard to find safe methods and plan to abandon the warehouses in Qinhuangdao, Nandaisi, and Beidaihe and use the stacking yards in Luangekou and Liushouying exclusively. They will add solid moisture-proof works and move all the goods to the area for storage. In the future, the smuggling route, since the customs patrol ship Yu Guang was monitored by the Japanese warships, the Qikou Zhao Jiagou area on the sea has been unimpeded, so it is planned to use water and land liaison. The goods are loaded on steamships from Dalian and transported to Qikou, and then transported by horse-drawn carts and mules to the hinterland of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces to avoid the inspection offices in Xuzhou and gradually sell them along the Yangtze River. The ronin now feel that there is no better plan than to open up sales channels in Jiangsu and Anhui. If this road is blocked, the North China market will remain stagnant, and the future of smuggling will completely fall into pessimism.</p>
<p>A lot of cotton yarn is also transported in the smuggled goods. Gaoyang in southern Hebei and Zhoucun in western Shandong are both local cloth producing areas and used to purchase finished products from the Tianjin-Jinan yarn factories. Since smuggled cotton has been selling well, the sales of Tianjin-Jinan national yarn have gradually declined. The Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Huaxin yarn factories in Tianjin have to lose 1,500 to 2,500 yuan per day. A month ago, each bag of yarn was sold at a loss of only 10 yuan due to the dumping of Japanese yarn, but now it is more than that. Sometimes it has to lose 20 to 30 yuan. The yarn market transaction is not enough to control the private sales of yarn. In order to save themselves, the factories recently agreed to adopt a joint operation and mutual support method to work hard to resist Japanese yarn. If the struggle is effective, the future is still promising. Otherwise, before the Japanese yarn monopoly plan in China succeeds, we will be exhausted and unable to support it. (10th)</p>

<p>He Had Discussions with Relevant Parties When Passing Through Tianjin; Meeting With Important Chinese and Japanese Figures in Beiping and Will Soon Return South</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Wang Kemin, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, recently went north from Shanghai at the invitation of Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the committee. After paying a visit to President Jiang in Nanjing to ask for instructions on everything, he took the Shanghai-Beiping train and went directly to Tianjin. He stayed in Tianjin for two days and had discussions with relevant parties. After finishing the business, he took a chartered car prepared by the Beining Railway at 11:38 a.m. on the 9th and attached it to the Tianjin special express train to Beiping. Those who welcomed him at the Dong station included Mayor Qin Dechun, Gao Shengyue, the representative of the Political Affairs Committee, Duan Zonglin, a member of the Hebei Provincial Government, Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and forty to fifty leaders of the Beiping banking industry. After Wang got off the train and exchanged greetings with Qin and others, he went to the Beijing Hotel to stay. Soon Wang Yitang, Chen Juesheng, and others went to the hotel to meet with Wang and left after a brief conversation.

<p>Tank Car Trial Runs on the 8th and 9th, Field Exercise in Western Beiping on the 10th</p>
<h3 id="e79">Citizens Alarmed, Roads Destroyed <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the increase of the Japanese garrison in North China, the garrison locations have been completely allocated. The Japanese troops in various places have been allocated trucks and tank cars by the Japanese military headquarters. After the Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai received the tank cars, they notified us to hold a test run exercise on the 8th and 9th. On the morning of the 10th, they also held a field exercise at Lugouqiao in western Beiping. On the 8th, the first day, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Fengtai, led by more than 10 officers, took trucks and brought nine tank cars, four large and five small (all weighing less than five tons), and drove from Fengtai to Nanyuan. After a short rest, they went straight into Yongdingmen, passed through Tianqiao Qianmen Street, Dongxi Jiaomin Lane, exited Hepingmen, went south along Xizhushikou to Tiantan for a rest. At about 5:00 p.m., they left Tiantan and went west, exited Guang'anmen and returned to Fengtai. On the 9th, the second day, at about 9:00 a.m., more than 100 Japanese soldiers again took eight trucks, two motorcycles, and seven large and small tank cars, and entered Guang'anmen from Fengtai via Nanyuan. They drove east for about three li and turned north into Qianmen. It was already noon. A part of them stopped in front of Tiananmen for a rest, and a part of them rested in Xipishi inside Qianmen. There were armed Japanese soldiers with guns guarding the tank cars. After a short rest, the soldiers had lunch in the trucks, and the officers had a picnic at the back door of Zhongshan Park. At 2:30, they gathered again and exited Qianmen, entered Chongwenmen via Dongzhushikou, and went north. At 4:30, they went to Chaoyangmen for an exercise. They rested at Miaojiadi Target Pavilion that night. At 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, they went to Lugouqiao in western Beiping again for a field exercise. After completion, they returned to the Fengtai barracks. When armed Japanese soldiers entered the city to parade on the 8th and 9th, many pedestrians stopped to watch and discussed this kind of demonstration. At noon on the 9th, when the Japanese soldiers were resting in Xipishi, an American man came in a car with the number 499 to take pictures. After being discovered by the Japanese soldiers, they firmly refused. The American man had no choice but to be persuaded to leave. After this decisive Japanese soldier entered the city to parade, the asphalt roads in the city were mostly loose and melted due to the hot weather in recent days. In addition, they were crushed by a large number of trucks and heavy tank cars, resulting in damage in many places. More than 80 Japanese soldiers stationed in Beiping, fully armed with rifles and machine guns, left the barracks in a team at 8:00 a.m. on the 9th and went to the Wangye Tomb and Dongdaqiao area in the eastern suburbs for an exercise without lead arrows. They finished at about 2:00 p.m. and returned to Beiping along the Beining Railway Beiping Tongxian Railway branch line. They also practiced street fighting along the way. The nearby residents did not know what was going on and were all alarmed. At about 5:00 p.m., the Japanese soldiers entered the city. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Financial and Commercial Situation in Jiangxi Province at the End of the Year <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Economic Recession Affects People's Livelihood, Stores Go Bankrupt and Crave Relief, Yuan Ticket Problem is Also Very Important</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The banks in this city closed for three days from the 1st to the 3rd to make the settlement for the 24th year. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Continental Bank, National Products Bank, Construction Bank, and Farmers Bank (the above are branches in Shanghai), Yumin, and Municipal Second Vocational (local banks) all have surpluses, ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to a few thousand yuan. However, due to the sluggish market, they all adopted a tight policy in the year, and did not make credit loans, but only did door-to-door remittances and commodity mortgages, with a very small scope, and the profit was only one-third of the previous year. In the 25th year, except for the Farmers Bank and the Bank of China, which will carry out rural loans, the rest are in a state of shrinking stagnation and cannot break the deadlock, while a group of shops and rural areas have no capital to turn around, losing the exchange function, with difficulties both above and below, and the social finance and people's livelihood are in extreme distress and uneasiness.</p>
<p>In the 24th year, Nanchang's commerce, due to the aftermath of the banditry of the previous year, coupled with the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the amount of import and export trade decreased by 10 million yuan in one year. Large and small shops all felt that income was not enough to cover expenses and it was difficult to maintain. As of the end of the lunar year last year, 300 shops have reported bankruptcy. Since the beginning of this year, the situation has deteriorated. According to the Public Security Bureau's investigation, the number of shops closing down every month is between 40 and 50, which means that nearly 300 shops will have closed down in the first half of this year. The most prosperous Zhongshan Road, such as Wanlong, Huyuanxing, Zhang Zhengshun, Wu Anxiang, etc., are all locked up. Zhongzheng Road, such as Hong Kong Silver Building, Lianfu, Zhou Senxing, Fengfu, Tianfu, Jingchang, etc., have no way to open. Even those who barely open their doors are enduring the pain. The money industry, which was previously relied upon by all industries for turnover, is also unable to protect itself and will not last long, because money shops have limited funds and rely entirely on absorbing social deposits, floating funds, and store discounts to turn around. Therefore, what all industries are relying on for relief now is only the credit and mortgage loans of the banks. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is requesting the Provincial Yumin Bank to provide mortgage loans to relieve all industries. The method is that the shops borrowing the loans first report the collateral to the industry association, and then apply to the bank for approval. In addition to the collateral, two shop guarantees are required. The amount is from 300 yuan to 3,000 yuan per household. The interest rate and term are the same as the year-end loans of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications last year. Yuhang is still waiting and seeing this, but people in the financial world say that Yuhang has an original share capital of 2 million yuan and the right to issue more than 1 million yuan of auxiliary coins and copper yuan tickets. Now, because the market is sluggish and the collapse is very strong, there is no business to do, and in the future, it must make mortgage loans. Although the mortgage is a stagnant fund, the bank has the right to issue it, which can be used for turnover, and the market has collapsed to this point. If the public bank does not provide relief, it will be destroyed together.</p>
<p>There is also a financial problem in this province, which is the copper yuan ticket. Originally, there were three banks issuing copper yuan tickets in this city: Yumin, Municipal, and Construction. The number of yuan tickets circulating in the market is about one million strings (1,000 characters per unit). When the monetary system was reformed earlier, it was stipulated that each legal tender would be exchanged for 3,500 characters of yuan tickets. Since the price in various places was 3,000 characters, the money industry hoarded a large amount of yuan tickets and requested that it be changed to 3,000 for sea yuan. The three banks had to recover the yuan tickets that had been circulated before changing it to 3,000. There was a dispute, so a group of people refused to circulate the yuan tickets, making it extremely difficult to find change. Some used a few copper coins with a stamped note to find change, and some tore the yuan tickets into several pieces to find change. The most suffering are the coolies and hawkers, and the beggars also could not get a single penny all day long because there were no copper coins. The price of copper yuan tickets, which is closely related to the lower class, urgently needs to be changed to 3,000, so that it can be used consistently for turnover. (July 7)</p>

<p>In this county's sauce and wine industry, there were originally two companies, Wanquanyu and Laogongmao, with substantial capital and a wide range of businesses, with branches spread all over the county. After Wanquanyu went bankrupt the year before last, the only one left was Laogongmao, which had also experienced twists and turns. It was later maintained by shareholder Chen Shiqin. Three years later, due to sluggish finances and poor turnover, it closed down on the 9th, including all its branches, and entrusted lawyer Wang Kunfu to announce the liquidation. It is heard that the amount of deposit and loan has reached more than 300,000 yuan, and Chen is willing to use the field property to compensate for the debt.</p>

<p>Hupu Town along the river in this county is a famous fish market in Jiangsu Province. Every spring and summer, the ocean floods are very prosperous, and most merchants from all over the world go to Hupu to set up temporary shops, and their lives are quite developed, commonly known as rushing to the ocean flood. It is now midsummer, and the fish flood has ended. According to the fish merchants in the town, this year's fish flood is very different from last year's business. According to statistics, the income is less than 60% of that of previous years, and the expenses are huge. Most of the fish businesses have losses and no profits, and other temporary shops that rushed to the ocean flood also have bleak lives and are greatly affected. Now that the fish market is about to end, the merchants have no way to end it. Zhou Yinhuai, the owner of a fish business, and others have initiated and collected funds to perform dramas to revitalize the market and save this declining market.</p>

<p>Wang Shou-xuan, the current patrol officer of the Meili Third Sub-bureau, is accused of having an affair with Xu Mei-jun, the wife of a clerk named Cao.

Recently, the bureau ordered Cao to be transferred to the Seventh Precinct and his wife was temporarily lodged at Patrol Officer Wang's place. Unexpectedly, Wang had an affair with Xu. When Cao sent a letter to take her back, Wang ignored it. When Cao went to pick her up in person, he learned the truth. She had already gone to the city with Patrol Officer Wang. Cao, in a moment of anger and unbearable grief, attempted to drown himself in the river multiple times. Fortunately, he was rescued each time. He is now in a state of insanity.

<p>The Ministry of Railways, together with the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is actively constructing the Qianjiang Bridge. Once completed, the railway lines on both sides of the Qianjiang River will be directly connected, and the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will be operational. To this end, the Ministry has borrowed a large sum from the Construction Bank of China and is actively planning to build the Zha Cao section from Zhakou through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing to Cao'e. A large bridge will also be built over the Cao'e River to connect with the Yong Cao section. In the future, passengers will be able to travel from Shanghai to Ningbo from morning to evening. The route from Zhakou over the Qianjiang Bridge to Cao'e has already been surveyed. It has been decided to borrow the Hangzhou Railway line from the edge of Nanjiang along Jingjiang Station to Xiaoshan and relay heavy-duty rails. The land acquisition for the roadbed from Xiaoshan to Cao'e is underway. In order to complete the connecting engineering of the Zha Cao section quickly, the Ministry of Railways has already decided to send Zhang Haiping to Zhejiang to preside over the connecting rail engineering of the section. The formal announcement will be made in the coming days. However, the date of commencement of construction is yet to be determined. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways believes that the Qianjiang Bridge will soon be completed, and that this connecting engineering should be completed as soon as possible. Therefore, it has been decided that the connecting of the rails must be completed within ten months from the date of commencement of construction to achieve direct traffic between Ningbo and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Welcoming Personnel: Those who arrived to welcome them yesterday afternoon included Chen Xing, Ye Zhuotang, Xi Demao, Shou Yicheng, Song Hanzhang, Qian Xinzhi, Bei Songsun, Ye Fuxiao, Du Yuesheng, Tang Shoumin, Zou Bingwen, Yang Jiemei, Sun Ruihuang, Shi Boqun, Cheng Lian of the banking world, Zhang Yujiu, Ji Zejin of the International Trade Bureau, Gao Dazhong of the Ministry of Railways, Sun Silin, Tong Runfu of the National Economic Council Cotton Control Association, Huang Boqiao of the Two Roads Bureau, Chen Peide, Chen Juchuan, Jiang Huaisu of the Zhenjiang Shanghai Association, Rong Hongkang of Shenxin Textile Factory, and more than a hundred family members of the three gentlemen, all standing under the scorching sun, looking eastward. At 4 o'clock, the "Bostan" slowly entered the port and docked at about 5 o'clock. The welcoming personnel immediately went up the stairs to the ship. Mr. Chen and others met in the main restaurant. Mr. Guo Bingwen entertained them on behalf of Mr. Chen. After shaking hands with Mr. Chen and others, they returned to shore one after another.</p>
<p>Speeches Delivered: Mr. Chen and others met with reporters on board and delivered a written statement saying: "In March of this year, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance commissioned us to go to the United States to discuss monetary issues related to China and the United States and to investigate the economic, financial, and trade conditions of various countries. After arriving in the United States, we were warmly received by the U.S. Treasury Department, and we discussed cooperation issues with us in a very sincere manner. After seven weeks of long discussions, the U.S. and Chinese Treasury Departments reached a practical cooperation method. The content has been seen in the declarations of Minister Kong and Mr. Morgen-thau. In general, we will maintain an independent and independent monetary system and try to promote the use of silver. The United States will purchase silver from China and provide us with the convenience of U.S. currency at any time. After this negotiation, our already substantial foreign exchange reserves will be significantly increased, sufficient to maintain the external value of our currency and make it impossible to shake. Therefore, our monetary reform has been truly successful, and the foundation for economic recovery has begun. On the other hand, the world price of silver can also be stabilized, realizing the long-standing proposition of China and the United States and laying the foundation for future economic cooperation between the two countries. This is what those who are involved in it feel extremely happy about. When this was decided in Washington, President Roosevelt kept asking about the progress of the talks and was very satisfied with the results of the talks. The U.S. authorities, including President Roosevelt and key members of the Ministry of Finance and external affairs, as well as congressional leaders such as Mr. Pittman, are deeply interested in the progress of monetary reform led by our Ministry of Finance and do not hesitate to provide assistance. All sectors of American society also expressed sympathy for our various efforts, which is admirable. As for the results of the talks, since the main purpose is to promote the stability of our currency, the conditions that we abide by should be implemented as soon as possible. The improvement of our central bank should also be realized as soon as possible, so that it can become the sole manager of our currency and credit and bring the national finance into the right track."</p>
<p>Going to Beijing Tonight: He continued, "When returning from the United States and Europe, we took the opportunity to investigate the latest trends in the world economy, finance, and trade. We will try to use what we have learned when serving the country to fulfill the duties of a citizen." In addition, reporters asked Mr. Chen and others whether they had gone to England to conclude an agreement on the sale of silver in London. According to reports, when passing through Hong Kong, reporters there also asked about this. In fact, Mr. Chen and others went to Europe from the United States in early June and returned to China by ship through France and Italy. They did not actually go to the United Kingdom, so there was no agreement with England. It is a rumor that does not need to be denied. "He then got off the ship and returned home to rest. It is heard that the Central Bank has reported to Finance Minister Kong in Beijing and decided to go to Beijing tonight to report the process to the authorities."</p>

<h3 id="e102">Draft Agreement on Factory Inspection: Consular Body Requests Amendment <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Saying that it cannot be applied to factories in countries with consular jurisdiction. Since Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Shanghai Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden discussed the draft "Agreement on the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Shanghai International Settlement," which was passed by the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 24th of last month, the Japanese side opposed it. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Council applied to the Consular Body for ratification again on the next day (the 25th). Unexpectedly, the Consular Body's meeting the day before yesterday failed to pass the draft as it was and requested that it be amended.</p>
<p>Consular Body Resolution: The Consular Body did not hold a meeting until 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. The head consul, British Consul-General in Shanghai, Brenan, convened a meeting in the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting room. U.S. Consul-General Gauss, Japanese Consul Terasaki, Italian Consul-General Nilon, Belgian Consul-General Tanerfu, Norwegian Acting Consul-General Kierde, Swedish Consul-General Beck-Friis, Swiss Consul-General Raudi, Dutch Consul-General Bousquet, Danish Consul-General Heer, Portuguese Consul-General Alves, Spanish Consul-General Fure, Brazilian Consul-General Branco, etc. all attended. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Brenan. After a long discussion, there was no objection to the principles of the agreement. However, if no distinction was made between countries with consular jurisdiction and countries without consular jurisdiction, and the agreement was followed across the board, it would not be acceptable and would have to be amended. That is, the agreement could only be applied to Chinese factories and factories in countries without consular jurisdiction within the Settlement. Factories in countries with consular jurisdiction could not be cited. It was resolved that the head consul would reply to the Municipal Council by letter to this effect. The meeting lasted for an hour before it was adjourned.</p>
<p>Reply to the Chairman of the Municipal Council: Head Consul and British Consul-General Brenan, based on the resolution of the Consular Body meeting, sent a letter to Arnold, Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 11:00 AM yesterday to reply. The original letter is translated as follows: "In reply, I have received your letter of June 25 from the Director-General. I am now authorized to reply that the Consular Body has carefully considered the draft agreement on the implementation of the Chinese Factory Law in the International Settlement. My colleagues want me to reply that they are very sympathetic to the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities' efforts to find a satisfactory solution to this problem. However, there is one important point, that is, they request that this agreement must have an amendment. It is found that this agreement intends to apply Chinese law to all factories in the Boundary, regardless of their nationality, which will inevitably lead to the abolition of a part of the treaty privileges of countries with consular jurisdiction. However, the Municipal Council should know that it has no right to make such a decision within its authority. Such a step is a matter between the governments of various countries and the Chinese government. Therefore, the Consular Body requests that Your Excellency should strive to obtain an amendment to this draft agreement, clearly stipulating that its provisions can only be applied to factories within the Boundary that are subject to Chinese jurisdiction. On the contrary, that is, it cannot stipulate any words that involve factories of various countries participating in the Municipal Council in the Yangjingbang Regulations as the same inspection steps, etc."</p>
<p>Will Negotiate Again: After receiving the letter from Brenan, Chairman of the Municipal Council, Arnold, summoned Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden to discuss the matter and instructed Fessenden to notify us. Because yesterday was Saturday afternoon, the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government were closed. Today is also a Sunday holiday. Fessenden is now scheduled to meet with Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun tomorrow to continue negotiations. This pending case that has been negotiated for four or five years, just after the draft agreement was discussed and everyone was celebrating that it had been resolved, now the Consular Body has requested to propose amendments, and another wave of twists and turns has occurred.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Silver Money Industry Association cabled congratulations to the Second Plenary Session, which reads: "To the Central Party Department of Nanjing, transferred to the Second Plenary Session, since September 18, the flames of the enemy have become increasingly rampant, and the national situation has become increasingly precarious.

The Central Committee convened the Second Plenary Session to determine major policies, which is in line with the national conditions. There are many talented party and national elders, and the plans are broad, and the national policies adopt the strengths of all parties' criticisms. All of you have come from afar, or you are carrying out your duties diligently, you are talented in governance, or you are taking charge of the army, you have knowledge of strategy and tactics, the loyalty of Fang Du to the country is far away, the ambition of Wei Huo to defend the Wei is well established, and we pray that you will express your sincerity and work together sincerely, unite and work together, and forever eliminate the suspicion of the soldiers, and greatly expand the national plan for a hundred years.

<h3 id="e107">Haiheng Steamer Stops Selling Tickets to Shantou and Guangdong <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Whether other ships will stop selling tickets has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>The number of passengers coming to Shanghai from Guangdong in recent days is rare in the past two years. The Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhen steamer imported passengers from Shantou and Guangzhou, filling all the cabins. According to people on the ship, the Hai Zhen steamer's ticket revenue this time reached 8,090 yuan, which is a new record after the completion and navigation of the Four New Steamers. Due to the situation, the amount of goods coming from Shantou and Guangdong has been greatly reduced. From Shanghai, except for soybean cakes, there are no other goods to be loaded. Yesterday, the Merchants Steam Navigation Company ordered the new Hai Heng steamer to sail from Shanghai to Nanhua and immediately stop selling tickets from Shanghai to Guangdong and Shantou. It was only allowed to sell tickets from Shanghai to Xiamen and Hong Kong. It is up to the situation to decide whether the other three Hai steamers will also stop selling tickets to Shantou and Guangdong. It is heard that the reason for the Hai Heng's suspension of ticket sales to Guangdong is that the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee does not want the Four New Steamers, which were built with Boxer Indemnity funds, to sail into the turbulent Guangdong situation again. If the situation can improve, tickets to Shantou and Guangdong can be sold at any time.</p>

<p>Hwa Mao Aground at Reef The Hwa Xin Trading Company's "Hwa Mao" steamship, registered at 4,713 tons but capable of carrying 7,000 tons of cargo, is currently sailing around Luzon in the South Seas. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the "Hwa Mao" stating that at 10:05 PM on the 10th, while sailing in the waters off Luzon, in an area called Calemboyanga, the ship mistakenly strayed from its course due to fog and ran aground on a reef. It was unable to move. Subsequent inspection revealed that the ship's bow was still 60 feet from the reef, so the hull had not yet been damaged or sprung a leak. However, the water depth at the grounding point was only 16 feet, while the ship's draft was 25 feet, leaving the ship unable to move. It could not free itself from the shallows. It is planned to take advantage of the high tide this morning to attempt to reverse off the reef. If this is unsuccessful, arrangements will have to be made to send a ship to rescue, tow, and offload cargo.</p>
<p>Shun An Damaged The Haitong Company's "Shun An" steamship, with a load capacity of 1,455 tons, is currently sailing between ports in the North and South Seas. Yesterday, a telegram from the ship stated that as it was unmooring in Xiamen, the engine had just started when the rear propeller became entangled in a floating drum's iron chain. The engine was quickly shut down, and divers were hired to inspect. It was found that the propeller shaft had been severed, and the iron chain from the floating drum was tightly wrapped around the propeller hub. The ship was unable to sail. Arrangements were immediately made to send a ship to tow the "Shun An" to the Xiamen Naval Shipyard for major repairs, replacement of the propeller, and removal of the chain entangled in the hub. This will result in a delay in the ship's schedule and significant losses.</p>

<p>Salt Merchant Representatives Come to Shanghai to Sign Contract</p>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reports that, due to economic panic and slow sales of stored salt, salt merchants in Northern Jiangsu previously sent representatives to Shanghai to request loans from major banks in the city, using the stored salt as collateral, to provide relief. They proposed a mortgage of 50 cents per package, but due to various difficulties, no agreement was reached. Now, the salt merchants have once again appointed Qiu Mengling, Li Yangren, and others as representatives to come to Shanghai to continue negotiations. Qiu and others arrived in Shanghai from Banpu the day before yesterday. In recent days, they have reached an agreement with the Bank of China to provide a loan of 35 cents per package of salt, with a total loan amount of approximately 3 million yuan. The bank's seven conditions have reportedly been fully accepted by the salt merchants due to their urgent need for funds. The contract is expected to be signed within a few days.</p>

<p>Total Loan Amount of 56 Million National Currency Survey Work Begins, Estimated to Be Completed in Two Years</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government is preparing to form the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The required funds have been negotiated by Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, and Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank Corporation. It has been decided that the Construction Bank Corporation will invest 56 million yuan. The loan contract has now been formally signed. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has begun surveying. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing the Company Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, prepared a detailed plan for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and consulted with the Ministry of Railways to organize the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to be responsible for the construction. The company's organizational regulations were formally approved by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on March 21 of this year, stipulating that the total amount of shares would be 20 million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares, with the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each recognizing 25,500 shares, and the rest to be raised independently. The company may issue company bonds to supplement the construction funds.</p>
<p>Responsible for Road Construction After Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, prepared the budget and route map for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and submitted them to Zhang Jiaao, Minister of Railways, for approval, the route was determined to first build the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing, and the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong. After completion, other lines will be expanded. It was also decided that the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company would be responsible for the construction. The Ministry of Railways has now sent a large number of surveyors to work with the company's surveyors to carry out survey work according to the planned route. Construction is expected to begin in the shortest possible time, and the entire line is expected to be completed and open to traffic within two years.</p>
<p>Loan Signed After the construction budget for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was approved by the Ministry of Railways, Director Lu visited Shanghai several times to negotiate investment with Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank Corporation.

According to reliable information obtained by the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the investment has become a reality. The China Construction Bank Corporation has decided to invest 56 million yuan.

<p>Secretary-General Yu Hopes the Japanese Side Will Remain Calm</p>
<p>The case of Kaya Sho Kozaku, an employee of the seafood department of the Japanese Mitsubishi Yangxing in this city, who was shot in the head by an unknown person at the entrance of Aisi Lane on Zhaosiwei Road and Qimei Road the night before last, and died in hospital after treatment, has occurred. After the incident, the municipal government immediately ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. The Japanese Acting Consul-General Sugihara also met with Secretary-General Yu at the Municipal Government yesterday to discuss everything. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sugihara Meets with Secretary-General Yu At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Sugihara, the Acting Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, went to the Municipal Government to request the immediate arrest of the murderer and protection of Japanese nationals in the case of the Japanese national Kaya Sho Kozaku being robbed and fatally injured on Qimei Road. Secretary-General Yu received him and replied that the Municipal Government has repeatedly ordered its subordinates to strictly handle the protection of Japanese nationals. After the incident last night, the government ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the murderer within a time limit and to pay more attention to protecting Japanese nationals. He hoped that the Japanese side would remain calm and not repeat the terror of last year's Japanese sailor case, so as not to cause panic throughout the city and increase the difficulty of handling matters for both authorities. Sugihara expressed satisfaction and then left.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Instructions to the Public Security Bureau The original text of the Municipal Government's instructions to the Public Security Bureau the night before last stated that it was reported that at 8:20 PM tonight, a Japanese national named Kaya Sho Kozaku was shot and injured near Zhaosiwei Road and Qimei Road. Therefore, it is urgently ordered that the Director of the Bureau must strictly order his subordinates within a time limit to earnestly find a way to strictly arrest the murderer in this case and bring him to justice. Furthermore, it is found that there are many Japanese nationals in the area near the road built beyond the boundary in the northern district. It has been ordered to the Director of the Bureau to earnestly liaise with the Police Department of the concession and take other careful and effective measures to protect them on record. You must still follow the instructions and be responsible for handling the matter, and not allow any more incidents to occur. This order is strictly issued.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Head of the Nanyang Survey Mission Gao Shiheng Talks About the Mission to the South <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Survey Mission is scheduled to depart on July 16, which is a great undertaking for our country to conduct a commercial survey overseas. Gao Shiheng, the head of the mission, told visitors yesterday about the mission to the South as follows: Gao said that with the help of the Nanyang overseas Chinese and the government, the mission to the South consists of fifteen people, representing thirty-seven domestic goods manufacturing factories, and is scheduled to depart on the 16th of this month. The Nanyang overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about the cause of the motherland and often return to the country for surveys. This year, survey missions from Siam, Surabaya, Manila, etc. have visited Shanghai one after another to visit domestic goods factories, and the impression is very good. They believe that domestic goods have made rapid progress recently and should be promoted in various parts of Nanyang. Moreover, the overseas Chinese love the motherland and are very enthusiastic about the promotion of domestic goods. Therefore, at the request of the overseas Chinese, the China National Industries and Foreign Trade Association organized the Nanyang Commercial Survey Mission to go to various parts of Nanyang for exhibitions. Recently, letters have been received from the general chambers of commerce and other overseas Chinese organizations in various parts of Nanyang, all expressing their welcome. Their enthusiasm is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Nanyang has always been known as a wealthy area, and there are more than 5.5 million overseas Chinese, which is a great market. However, the import of domestic goods is still small, which is not enough to meet the consumption of overseas Chinese. In recent years, the domestic industrial circles have also paid great attention to the Nanyang market. The organization of this mission is to publicize the current situation of domestic goods, so that the overseas Chinese in Nanyang can have a full understanding of the outstanding achievements of the domestic industry, and plant a good influence. At the same time, it also opens up a market foundation for the domestic goods industry in various parts of Nanyang, so as to solve the current serious problems of the domestic goods industry. However, in the Nanyang market, neighboring countries often have various survey missions conducting surveys, with the intention of actively implementing the Southward policy and establishing their economic power in Nanyang. Therefore, in addition to conducting commercial surveys, this mission also has complete samples of products from various industries, which will be donated to overseas Chinese in various places. There are more than 300 boxes in quantity, and a domestic goods exhibition will be organized with the local chamber of commerce and overseas Chinese organizations. After the exhibition, a showroom will be set up to display various domestic goods products. In recent years, the trade figures between China and Nanyang have been very small, and neighboring countries in the market are actively expanding their power. The mission of this mission is undoubtedly difficult, but with the guidance of the government and the enthusiasm of the factory circles and the warm welcome from the overseas Chinese in various places, the mission is willing to do its best to be a pioneer for the domestic goods industry. It is hoped that all circles will give guidance so as to complete the mission of this trip. It is earnestly hoped, etc.</p>

<p>Du Yuesheng Raises Another 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association is expanding the National Aviation Salvation Movement, raising funds to purchase aircraft and present them to the government as a gift for Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday celebration. Since the start of the work, it has been progressing rapidly with the enthusiastic sponsorship and promotion of Du Yuesheng and others. Mr. Du raised another 5,000 yuan in national currency from Mr. Wu Ruiyuan for the purchase of aircraft to celebrate the birthday, which was handed over to Mr. Zhang Yuliang to bring to the association for receipt. In addition, Gu Xinyi personally visited the aircraft purchase birthday celebration meeting yesterday and handed over 1,200 yuan in national currency raised by the flour mill industry association to Li Dachao, the director-general.

The previous payment of 500 yuan has been reported in various newspapers. Yesterday, another 500 yuan was sent to be used for the birthday celebration. It is still being promoted, and it is estimated that another 1,000 yuan can be raised.</p>

<p>Sails on the Coolidge on the 14th</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi, the representative of our country to the Pacific International Academic Society, came south from Ping, passed through Nanjing on the 10th, and took the night train to Shanghai, arriving at the station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went to a hotel to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited and was granted an audience. He said that the topic of discussion at this International Academic Society is "The Purposes, Influences, and Results of Economic and Social Policies in Pacific Countries," which was decided at the conference held in Canada three years ago. After research by various economists and political scientists in our country, various materials have been collected and essays have been written to be brought for reporting and discussion. It is inaccurate that the Japanese newspaper previously reported that the conference's discussion of this issue was to cater to Japan's current situation and accommodate the country's requirements. Hu also said that after the conference, he will also participate in the 300th anniversary celebration of the founding of Harvard University, and give academic lectures at the request of various parties. The date of his return to the United States is undecided. When the reporter asked Hu about his views on the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi and the situation in North China, he only smiled and did not answer, only saying that the current situation in Beiping is still peaceful. Hu will stay in Shanghai for two days. He said that because the weather is unusually hot, he declined all social engagements and lectures.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. Hu Shi, the representatives attending this conference who are in the country include Shen Kunshan, Zhang Zhongling, Shi Jiguang, and Liu Yuwan. Luo Chuanhua and Chen Rongjie have already gone to the United States in advance. Others such as Wu Bannong, Meng Zhi, Gu Ziren, Liang Yousheng, Ma Rurong, Zhu Youyu, Ji Chaoding, and Zhang Pengchun are all overseas and will attend directly. The representatives of our country are scheduled to travel on the President Coolidge of the Greater Eastern Company on the 14th. Shanghai financial leaders Qian Xinzhi and Xu Xinliu, etc., have scheduled a banquet for next Monday (the 13th) at the International Hotel to bid farewell.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 73rd district chief conference yesterday, chaired by County Chief Ye. The following cases were discussed and resolved: The travel expenses for the household registration police check have been approved for each district. It is necessary to first order the Public Security Bureau to select experienced police officers to set up household registration police. The county government will concentrate on training them on July 14 and then assign them to serve in various districts. In the current period of scarcity, tax revenue is low, and the funding of various agencies will be affected. The government has sent police to the countryside to strictly urge the payment of old debts. Each district should supervise the township chiefs to provide practical assistance. Cases of robbery and murder are seen from time to time in various districts. Each district should use the Baojia system to supervise the Baojia chiefs to earnestly investigate the traitors. On the one hand, the Public Security Bureau should be ordered to assign districts to patrol the borders, and the First Security Company should be ordered to transfer the team stationed in Minhang to patrol the coastal area of Chehai Bridge to prevent crime. To prohibit smokers, divide the areas for inspection: Minhang Gonghe Lane Bridge in the first district, Tangwan Caoxing Huajing in the second district, Maqiao Zhuanqiao in the third district, Linjiang Sanlin Donglin in the fourth district, and Chenhang Tangjiang Tiqiao in the fifth district.</p>

<p>Replenish Capital Expand Acceptance and Discount Business The Board of Directors Decides to Appoint Lu Zidong as General Manager</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank was established in September of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) with a capital of 1.2 million yuan. It operates all commercial banking business and also handles savings and trusts. It is a member bank of the Shanghai Banking Association and has successively joined the Bill Exchange and the Joint Reserve Committee. Over the years, the bank's authorities have been able to cater to the financial trends and have taken the lead in advocating a new system of accepting bills of exchange, which has been deeply valued by the financial and industrial and commercial circles. Last winter, in order to expand its business and help the silk industry, the bank submitted a request to Chairman Chiang, ordering the Ministry of Finance to properly plan and replenish the bank's capital. After the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to verify the bank's content, it repeatedly ordered the China, Communications, and Jiangsu Banks to check and handle the matter. After the bank consulted with the authorities of the three banks, a method has now been agreed upon to cooperate genuinely with the Jiangsu Bank. China Communications is willing to be the backing, allocating as much capital as possible to expand various businesses. The bank's chairman, Wang Yansong, proposed and the board of directors passed a resolution to extend an invitation to Lu Zidong, general manager of the Jiangsu Bank, to serve concurrently as the general manager of the bank, in order to achieve thorough cooperation. It is heard that Lu is scheduled to take over immediately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Decides Yesterday, the bank convened a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, including Directors Yu Zuoting, Wang Boyuan, Feng Zhongqing, Shou Yicheng, Pei Yunqing, Shen Qinzhai, Chen Ziming, Wang Boying, Luo Qinghua, and Supervisor Xu Jilun. They discussed Chairman Wang's proposal to appoint Lu Zidong, general manager of the Jiangsu Bank, to serve concurrently as general manager of the bank, which was unanimously passed. It was also decided to convene a temporary shareholders meeting at 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month to report on the improved business guidelines and the situation of replenishing capital. Warehouses or offices will be established in the silk regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to provide as much mortgage lending as possible. The discount business for accepted bills of exchange will also continue to be promoted to benefit industry and commerce. Internal expenses will be reduced as much as possible, all of which will be implemented step by step after General Manager Lu takes office.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Jiangsu Bank The bank is the Jiangsu Provincial Bank. In the first year of the Republic (1912), the provincial government formulated regulations through the provincial assembly to allocate 1 million yuan as capital to establish a head office in Shanghai, with Chen Guangfu as the first general manager. After its establishment, the business developed rapidly. At that time, the banking industry in our country did not know about savings and warehousing business. The bank was the first to organize it, which really opened up the trend. Up to now, twenty-five years later, it has been steadily developing. Last year, the capital was increased to 2 million yuan, and Lu Zidong succeeded as general manager, changing the general management office system to a head office system to save expenses, increase institutions, and promote business. The future is even more promising. At present, in addition to the paid-in capital of 2 million yuan, there are 1.7 million yuan in various public reserves and 23 million yuan in various deposits. The total business volume has reached 38 million yuan. There are currently 33 branches and offices, located throughout Jiangsu Province and the surrounding industrial and commercial centers. In addition to the various statutory businesses of commercial banks, the business includes savings and trusts, and acting as the provincial and county treasury. Since the founding of the Republic, domestic political finance has undergone repeated changes, and financial institutions have risen and fallen accordingly. However, the bank has been able to survive the risks and has never been affected. Its progress may not necessarily be faster than others, so it can withstand the wind without damage. This is all due to the consistent policy of steady progress by successive leaders. At the beginning of its establishment, the bank had already obtained the right to issue banknotes, and printed millions of convertible notes. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), it voluntarily gave up the right to issue banknotes and burned all the convertible notes to avoid the expansion of local currency and to consolidate the bank's foundation. This alone is enough to show the excellent vision and careful management of the bank's authorities. Its outstanding reputation is not accidental.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Lu Zidong Mr. Lu is a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang. He is 45 years old. He studied in the United States in his early years and obtained a degree. After returning to China, he had outstanding achievements in managing industries. He successively served as the general manager of Changxing Coal Mine Company and the general manager of Lieshan Coal Mine Company. He is currently the chairman and general manager of Dazhong Coal Mine Company. Last year, he was also hired as the general manager of Jiangsu Bank. His careful planning and rapid business progress have increased the total business volume to more than 38 million yuan, and the number of deposits has also increased more than doubled. It shows that Mr. Lu is both experienced and steady. Mr. Lu was newly elected as an executive committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Members Congress and also serves as the director of the Finance Committee and the director of the General Affairs Department.</p>
<p>Prospects for Silk Industry Bank The Silk Industry Bank was established not long ago, and the total amount of deposits once reached 3.5 million yuan. The bank's authorities are also striving to adapt to the modern financial trends. The bank's organization has basically been established and has been well received by the public. However, due to limited funds, it has not been able to fully expand its business. Now that it has the genuine cooperation of Jiangsu Bank, and China Communications Bank is willing to be the backing, the capital will be replenished and the credit will be consolidated. The bank's reputation will inevitably increase day by day. With Lu Zidong serving as general manager, earnestly rectifying the bank's affairs and expanding its business, the bank's prospects are even brighter, and business progress can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Laogezhilu Old Zhengli Dyeing Shop Forced by Police to Pay Business License Fee</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Old Zhengli Dyeing Shop, a member of the Tenth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens Association in this city, was investigated by the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Concession Municipal Council at the end of last month regarding a business license. The shop replied to the detectives that businesses on this road have never had such a business donation. The detectives then left a paper written in Western language. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month, detectives from the Yuandang Road police station were sent to the shop, saying the police station had an important case and to go quickly. The shop sent a staff member, and the police station said that failure to obtain a health permit would result in a fine of ten yuan. Because the staff member did not have any money at the time, he was detained for four hours. The district branch sent a letter to the French Concession Taxpayers Association yesterday requesting negotiations. The original text is recorded below: "To the honorable sir, according to the letter from our member, Xu Huijun of the Old Zhengli Dyeing Shop, at the end of June this year, Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Municipal Council inquired at our shop whether we had a business license. Our shop replied that all businesses on this road (Hague Road) have never donated for such a license, and our shop does not need to make an exception to donate. The Municipal Council staff then suddenly asked if there was a health permit, and we replied that our shop is a branch, and there is no machinery installed inside, nor is there washing or dyeing. All items sent for dyeing by customers are sent to the main store for washing and dyeing every day. It is purely a receiving and sending operation, and there is no obstacle to hygiene. According to reason, there is no need to donate a health permit. The staff member did not say anything and left a paper written in Western language. Our shop thought that the facts had been clearly stated and there would be no problem. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a patrolman and a detective from the Beidang Road police station came to the shop and said that the police station had an important case and asked to go quickly for questioning. Our shop often replied that it would be there after a short break, but the patrolman and detective were unbearably fierce, claiming that they must go immediately. Our shop thought that since we had not broken the law, it would not hurt to go for questioning. We sent a staff member to the police station. Unexpectedly, after entering the police station, the police chief said that the Municipal Council ordered a fine of ten yuan for not obtaining a health permit. Our shop staff member explained the previous situation and gave further explanations, but the police chief refused to accept it and forcibly detained our shop staff member in the police station for four hours. It was already 7:00 PM when the deputy police chief told our shop staff member, 'If you don't pay the fee today, I will send a patrolman to guard you overnight.' Such harsh measures are rare. Our shop was forced to pay a deposit of ten yuan in national currency and obtained a temporary receipt issued by the deputy police chief as evidence before being released. We thought that the Municipal Council had sent someone to investigate beforehand, and the facts were very clear. Why did they arbitrarily impose a fine? And the police station used methods to lure our shop staff member to the police station. After repeated explanations, not only did they not listen, but they forcibly detained him for four hours and wanted to send a patrolman to guard him overnight. If we had not temporarily paid the ten yuan deposit, how long would we have been unreasonably detained before being allowed to regain freedom? Such arbitrary arrests of the innocent, darkness without daylight, what is the meaning of human rights? What is the meaning of law? At this time of economic downturn, the unreasonable oppression our shop suffers is small, and the protection of all citizens is great. For this reason, we have no choice but to write to your association, requesting you to forward this to the Chinese Taxpayers Association and argue with the Municipal Council to recover the ten yuan in French currency that has been paid to the police station, and to ensure that the same thing does not happen again in the future, in order to relieve the difficulties of businesses and maintain human rights." After checking, the member operates a business at 1169AB Hague Road, and there is indeed no machinery or dyeing inside. Since it does not hinder hygiene, there is no need to donate a health permit in principle. However, the Municipal Council ordered the police station to impose a fine for no reason and forcibly detained the shop's staff member for more than four hours, and there was a tendency to continue the detention, which is far from legal. This matter involves the police station abusing its power and citizens being detained for no reason. It is reasonable to write to your association to negotiate with the Municipal Council to recover the ten yuan in national currency that has been paid, severely punish the police station's abuse of power, and ensure that the same thing does not happen again in the future, in order to maintain justice and promote human rights. This is for the public good. Respectfully, the Tenth District Branch of the Second Special District City Federation of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Tang Hai'an Will Return North; Guangdong's Adoption of the Silver Dollar System Shelved <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to Difficulties in Transferring Silver to Central Custody</p>
<p>Tang Shoumin's Trip South Decidedly Canceled</p>
<p>The Central Government, in order to unify the currency system, had sent Tang Hai'an, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Finance and Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, again with Feng Rui, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, to the South to discuss everything in detail. Subsequently, due to the Guangdong Province's difficulties in transferring silver to central custody, Tang's trip yielded no results. He will return to the North in a few days. At the same time, the southward trips of Tang Shoumin and Bei Zuyi have also been confirmed to be canceled. The reporter from Shenshi News Agency specially visited relevant parties yesterday to find out the details:</p>
<p>The Process of Two Discussions on System Change</p>
<p>According to a certain gentleman in financial circles familiar with this issue, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the currency system policy in January of last year, following central laws, all provinces have successively followed suit, so foreign exchange is stable and convenient for both Chinese and foreigners. The Guangdong Provincial authorities, due to the holding of the silver coin system, have not yet adopted the silver dollar system. The Ministry of Finance believes that the national currency system should be unified, so in April of this year, it sent Tang Hai'an, Senior Advisor and Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, to Guangdong to negotiate everything with the provincial financial authorities. The Guangdong provincial financial authorities, together with banking experts, conducted a special study and decided on a method, which Tang took to Beijing, and Feng Rui, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, accompanied him to Beijing to discuss everything. A concrete method was also drafted, and Tang was sent back to Guangdong with Feng Rui to handle it. This is the process of the Ministry of Finance's two decisions to discuss the adoption of the silver dollar system with the Guangdong provincial authorities.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Silver Sales Shelved</p>
<p>After Tang and Feng arrived in Hong Kong, Tang initially stayed in Hong Kong temporarily, while Feng immediately returned to the province. Later, it was heard that the transfer of silver to central custody had not been agreed upon, and the Guangdong provincial authorities believed that the transfer of silver to central custody was difficult to handle. They automatically sent personnel from the Legal Tender Committee to Hong Kong to build a large silver warehouse to store Guangdong's silver reserves, so they decided to stop the transfer to the central government and stated that if the central government insisted on unifying the currency system, it would have to find another appropriate method, which Guangdong would certainly accept. Therefore, although Tang had this trip, in fact, he may not have had direct negotiations with the Guangdong provincial authorities, and turned back to Hong Kong. At the same time, recent reports have said that the Guangdong provincial authorities have prepared to sell the stored silver to foreign merchants and have transported a large number of them to Hong Kong for deposit in foreign banks. Judging from this, the issue of Guangdong's adoption of the silver dollar system seems to have been shelved for the time being.</p>
<p>Guangdong Officials Once Came to Beijing and Shanghai to Investigate</p>
<p>It was also learned that the Guangdong Provincial Legal Tender Committee recently sent Secretary Zhou Shuchang to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to investigate the financial situation and planned to form Guangdong Provincial Legal Tender branches, but the results were not very satisfactory. He returned to Guangdong at the end of last week to report to the authorities, so the Guangdong Province's recent decision to sell silver and deposit it in foreign banks in Hong Kong may have been determined by this.</p>
<p>Tang and Bei Are Not Going; Hai'an Will Return</p>
<p>According to reliable information, Tang Shoumin, manager of the Bank of Communications, and Bei Zuyi, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, who were sent by the Ministry of Finance to Guangdong Province to assist in discussing the adoption of the silver dollar system and reorganizing foreign exchange, have now decided to cancel their trip south because the issue has entered a state of being shelved. They will decide after the Ministry of Finance decides on a direction. As for Tang Hai'an, who was tasked with going to Guangdong to discuss the adoption of the silver dollar system, he has returned to Hong Kong from Guangdong to await transportation, so that he can return to the North to report on his mission as soon as possible, as this trip has not yielded results.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Concessions Treat Opium Offenders According to the Anti-Opium and Anti-Drug Regulations <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The anti-opium and anti-drug regulations promulgated by the central government have been in effect for a long time. Due to special circumstances in the concessions of this city, although the special district courts have handled opium and drug cases in accordance with these regulations, the police, who have the power to prosecute, still filed charges against opium and drug offenders based on the opium crime provisions of the criminal law that had been abolished, resulting in the judiciary, prosecution, and investigation each acting independently, which affected the dignity of our country's judiciary. Although the foreigners had previously expressed their willingness to comply with the new regulations, they have not yet been implemented. Now that we have added a "possession" clause to the regulations, and after repeated consultations with the Public Concession Municipal Council, the Council has now fully understood and sincerely assisted our country's anti-opium policy, so that the concession area will not become a haven for opium addicts in the future and be criticized by the world. From yesterday, the opium and drug offenders sent by the police stations to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation have all been prosecuted according to the Shanghai Anti-Opium Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Debate Concludes in Seduction and Abandonment Case Demanding Huge Compensation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Shiyue Demands $144,000</p>
<p>Chen Mingxun Proves Playing and Cohabitation</p>
<p>Zheng Shiyue, a Ningbo woman who is now twenty years old, was a salesperson at the Great American Tobacco Company. Recently, she hired lawyer Wang Liangqing to sue Chen Mingxun, the owner of the Rixin Chang Foreign Goods Store at No. 29, Lane 240, Edward Road, in the First Special District Court for seduction and abandonment, and attached a civil suit demanding $144,000 for living expenses. The court had already summoned each party once, as reported in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi held a continued hearing. Zheng Shiyue was absent due to illness and was only represented by her lawyer Wang. Chen Mingxun arrived in court with his defense lawyer Wu Linkun and presented a defense, stating that the plaintiff Zheng Shiyue was a prostitute at No. 82 Wufu Lane. In October of the 23rd year of the Republic, the defendant was invited by friends Cao Shourong and Shen Xingu to go to play, and the defendant also invited friends to play mahjong. The plaintiff became increasingly close to the defendant because of this and coaxed him in every way, so they cohabited, but there was no intention to marry the plaintiff as his wife or to take her as a member of his family. He also did not know that she already had a husband and did not force her to divorce her husband. Furthermore, regarding the legal provisions cited by the plaintiff, Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the criminal law for seducing a person with a spouse to leave their family, and Article 293, the first half of the abandonment crime, the crime in Article 240, Paragraph 2, must be prosecuted by the husband according to the Criminal Procedure Law, and the statute of limitations for prosecution is six months. The statute of limitations has also passed. Furthermore, Article 1 of the new criminal law stipulates that the punishment of an act is limited to the law that expressly stipulates it at the time of the act, that is, according to what the plaintiff said, its time was the 23rd year of the Republic, and the old criminal law was still applicable at that time, but the old criminal law did not have a provision like the crime in Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the new criminal law. Since the law has no express provision, it should not be punished. Furthermore, regarding Article 293 of the criminal law, the elements of the crime of abandonment require the abandoned person to be old, young, or disabled. The plaintiff is in her prime and is not a person without the ability to save herself. Furthermore, the plaintiff's identity is a secret prostitute, so the complaint does not conform to the facts of law and there is no reason. The complaint should be rejected, and a counterclaim for false accusation should be filed. Judge Huang questioned Chen Mingxun and ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the debate, then announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 16th.</p>

<p>Steward Protects, Averting Accident</p>
<p>The New Beijing steamer of the Taikoo Company, sailing the Shanghai-Ningbo line, set sail from Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 8th. At that time, a fashionable young woman in her twenties with permed hair and a Ningbo accent boarded the ship accompanied by a man and asked for stateroom No. 19. According to the steward Gu Jinshou, the man said that the woman was his sister and that she was ordered to return to Ningbo for a short stay because of a dispute with her family. He was afraid that she would attempt suicide en route, causing an accident, and asked him to take care of her and prevent it. After the man finished instructing, he left the ship. At around 10:00 PM that night, the ship's radio telegram, also from the International Radio Station with the surname Zhu, was still addressed to the steward, instructing him to take care of the female passenger carefully to prevent accidents. The ship's purser strictly ordered the steward to guard her. By the time the ship arrived in Ningbo the next day, the female passenger's relatives were waiting at the port and took her away, averting the accident.</p>

<p>Xu Muchun</p>
<p>Xu Muchun, a 24-year-old painter at Huimozhai Painting and Mounting Shop near Huanlong Bridge in the City God Temple Yu Garden, Danyang native, earned very little each month, but also fell into the trap of love. Economic hardship and obstacles in love left him with no interest in life. He often sighed, and on the 8th of this month, he suddenly walked out. He returned home on the night of the 10th, lying in silence. Until yesterday morning, a colleague saw that his expression was different and he was groaning, so he questioned him and learned that he had swallowed opium. He was immediately sent to Zhifu Hospital on Penglai Road for treatment. However, the poisoning was deep and the time had passed for too long, and he died shortly after. The police station was immediately notified, and the local chief Chen Baoyuan was ordered to report to the local court. Inspector Kong and others were commissioned to go to the scene to verify that the death was indeed due to poisoning and ordered the body to be collected for burial.</p>
<p>Chen Zhangshi</p>
<p>Chen Zhangshi, a 30-year-old woman from Suzhou, lived upstairs at No. 21 Haining Road in the Public Concession. The day before yesterday, she had an argument with her husband and was scolded by him. Feeling angry and frustrated, she secretly committed suicide by taking poison. By the time her husband noticed yesterday morning, he immediately hired a car and rushed her to Tongren Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. It is said that she was deeply poisoned and her life was in danger.</p>

<p>He Yusun, a Guangdong native, lived at No. 7, Hekang Lane, Dajing Road. Last month, introduced by Yang Genfa, he bought a ten-year-old Nanjing girl from Zhu Yonglin as an adopted daughter, named Qiuju, stating that the price was 70 yuan. Unexpectedly, less than a month after entering the house, she was still abducted by Zhu and disappeared without a trace. He then negotiated with the introducer Yang Genfa on the grounds that they had colluded to defraud him and took him to the Old North Gate police station, where Zhu was arrested. Zhu confessed that he had abducted her from the home of his mistress Zhou Wangshi, but she was not his biological daughter and her origins were also unknown. The girl is now hiding in the home of Wang Jinrong, a native of Haizhou, at No. 7, Tongji Lane, Pingjili Road, French Concession, etc. The parties involved were arrested and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation and verification.</p>

<p>Zhang Fengqi, a doctor at Guangdong Road Puqing Hospital, and his brother Zhang Fengshi, were recently sued by Niu Huaijin from Anhui in the First Special District Court for fraudulently obtaining property and causing injury through negligence, and attached a civil suit demanding compensation for damages of 15,600 yuan. The First Special District Court had already summoned each party once, as detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen held a continued hearing in the eighth criminal court. Chen Tingrui, the defense lawyer for the defendants Zhang Fengqi and Zhang Fengshi, began by stating that the defendant had previously submitted a registration book, and the plaintiff attacked it, saying that it was altered from a daily register, so today he specially brought the daily register to the case as proof. Furthermore, three witnesses were present in court today. One, Guo Kechen, is the gatekeeper of Yuqing Lane, Xixin Bridge, proving that the plaintiff Niu Huaijin previously opened the Huiren Hospital at No. 8 in the lane, and fled due to owing several months of rent. There are also two witnesses, named Chuan Jinsheng and Wang Hongtai. These two witnesses can prove that on December 23 of last year, they saw the plaintiff's eyes were already blind and his wife helped him to Puqing Hospital for treatment, because the two witnesses were also seeing a doctor at the time. The three witnesses were immediately summoned to court to provide evidence. The defendant Zhang Fengshi stated that the plaintiff not only opened the Huiren Hospital in Yuqing Lane, but also opened a hospital at the original site of the Shanghai Porridge Restaurant in the Oriental Hotel. Niu Huaijin denied ever opening a hospital, saying that the house at No. 8 Yuqing Lane was indeed rented by him, but the Huiren Hospital was opened by a friend, etc. Judge Tan believed that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

He was ordered to bring the defendant to court for identification. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the third criminal court, and Yu Mao Yushu took the initiative, saying that the defendant also went inside and that each got three and a half yuan after the fact.

<h3 id="e134">French Concession Police Department Declares Appeal in Gu Zhuxuan et al. Case <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Believing the Original Verdict Violated the Law; First Declaring Appeal, Now Drafting Reasons</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, former owner of the Tianchan Stage and president of the Jianghuai Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association from Yancheng, and Wang Xinggao, a Funing native who had previously served in the military and police, were reported by Zhao Guangfu, the perpetrator in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, as instigators of Tang's murder. The French Police Department arrested Gu and Wang one after another and sent them to the Second Special District Court for a verdict. Wang Xinggao was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights, and Gu Zhuxuan was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Because Gu and Wang did not accept the verdict, they appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court one after another. The trial concluded, and the verdict was announced on the 26th of last month, acquitting Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao. Wang Xinggao was allowed to be released on bail of 10,000 yuan during the appeal period and completed the bail procedures the day before yesterday, regaining his freedom. However, because Gu was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment in the case of smoking opium while in custody, he is still detained in the detention center. After the verdicts in the two cases were delivered by the police from the Third Branch of the High Court on the 3rd of this month, Guo Tang Youmei, the family member and younger sister of the victim Tang Jiapeng, learned of it and immediately requested the French Police Department to file an appeal. The Police Department accepted the request and carefully studied the reasons for the verdicts in the two cases, believing that there were violations of the law. Because the 10-day appeal deadline was approaching, they first drafted a statement of appeal and submitted it to the Third Branch of the High Court, declaring that they would appeal the two cases of Gu and Wang. Legal advisers and lawyers of the Police Department are currently studying and drafting detailed reasons for the appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Serial Killer and Repeat Offender Robber, Gu You Ting, Sentenced to Death <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>His Face Turned Pale Upon Hearing the Verdict, Official Informed Him of His Right to Appeal</p>
<p>Gu You Ting, a 34-year-old man from Shaoxing, had previously been convicted of multiple robberies. The First Special District Court sentenced him to ten years in prison. After being paroled in the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], at around 11 AM on August 1st of that year, he alone, armed, robbed Liu Ziyou, a rent collector for the Action Benefit Bank on Malang Road in the French Concession, of over 600 yuan in collected rent. He fled east along Kangti Road. Detectives heard the alarm and gave chase. Gu opened fire in resistance, mortally wounding a passerby, Jiang Jinshan (from Shaoxing, a houseboy). Jiang died instantly. Gu fled to the Shunyang Li entrance on Caishi Road, where he was finally apprehended by the detectives. However, during the emergency, he threw the stolen money into the road, where it was all picked up by passersby and children. Only a pistol and an original robber's check were found on Gu's person. He was sent to the Second Special Court. The police department initiated a public prosecution for both robbery and murder. After interrogation and judgment, Gu was sentenced to seven years for robbery and death for murder, to be carried out immediately. Gu appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Dissatisfied, the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered the original judgment overturned and the case returned to the Third Branch of the High Court for a retrial. This case has been repeatedly heard and examined by the High Court, with witnesses summoned. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Zhu Huanbiao, acting presiding judge of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by assessors Liao and Fan, came to the Third Tribunal, ordered the accused Gu to be brought to court, briefly questioned him, and then announced the verdict. The main text: The original judgment is reversed. Gu You Ting is sentenced to death as a serial killer and repeat offender.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Municipal Council Orders Removal of Shantytowns, Residents Surround Detectives <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Result: Extension Granted, But Must Relocate by the 15th; Organizing Shantytown United Association for all Locations in the International Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement sent detectives to evict the shantytown dwellers in the Eastern District. The shantytown dwellers surrounded the detectives with chamber pots and brooms. The following are the detailed findings of a reporter from the New Voice News Agency.</p>
<p>Total Exceeds Ten Thousand</p>
<p>The shantytowns in the Eastern District of the Public International Settlement are scattered throughout Pingliang Road, Yulin Road, Qiwupu Road, Qiqihar Road, Peikai'er Road, Helong Road, Meizhou Road, Hejian Road, Ningguo Road, Linqing Road, Xihu Road, Zhaoyang Road, Huade Road, Tangshan Road, Kunming Road, Zhoushan Road, Gelan Road, Liping Road, Longjiang Road, Funing Road, and other locations, totaling approximately ten thousand households.</p>
<p>History of the Shantytowns</p>
<p>These shantytown dwellers are mostly coolies from Jiangbei who came to Shanghai to make a living. Because rent is expensive, they built thatched sheds on desolate lands. Some of these lands are barren wastelands, some pay land rent to the landowners, and some belong to the Public Works Department. In the past, because they were in rural areas, neither the landowners nor the Public Works Department cared. However, as the market has become more prosperous in recent years, the Public Works Department attempted to add house numbers two years ago to increase the revenue from patrolmen's fees, but this was opposed and not implemented.</p>
<p>Limited Time for Relocation</p>
<p>Recently, the Public Works Department has repeatedly sent personnel to inspect and numbered the shantytown doors with green paint, intending to re-number the houses. At the same time, a notice was issued to the shantytowns west of Lan Road, stating: "Notice: These thatched sheds are located west of Meizhou Road and north of Helong Road, Title Deed No. 7842. This Bureau orders these shantytown dwellers to relocate by July 11, 1936, otherwise, they will be demolished. This is hereby notified." For shantytowns east of Lan Road, the deadline for relocation is August 8.</p>
<p>Armed Eviction</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8 AM, the Yulin Road Police Station and the Andong Road Branch of the Public Works Department sent over fifty armed Chinese and foreign detectives to the Yanshan Road and Qiqihar Road area, ordering the shantytown dwellers to relocate immediately, saying that if they did not move, they would be forcibly demolished. The shantytown dwellers pleaded for an extension and sent people to report to other locations, requesting assistance.</p>
<p>Surrounded by the Crowd</p>
<p>By 9 AM, shantytown dwellers from various locations, women carrying chamber pots, children carrying chamber pots and washcloths, and men carrying brooms, gathered over two thousand people, surrounding the fifty-odd detectives. The women stacked chamber pots around the detectives, forming a sort of wall. There were a large number of people shouting and cursing incessantly. The two sides were deadlocked. It was quite a farce.</p>
<p>Extension of Five Days</p>
<p>At that time, the foreign head of the detectives, helpless, after consulting with the crowd, told the shantytown dwellers that a five-day extension would be granted until the 15th (Wednesday), but they had to relocate within this period, otherwise, one hundred and twenty detectives and British soldiers would be sent to forcibly demolish the buildings. The shantytown dwellers considered the matter temporarily resolved and dispersed, and the detectives also left in disappointment.</p>
<p>Request for Negotiation</p>
<p>In addition to requesting negotiations with the Citizens' Association the day before, the shantytown dwellers requested He Dekui of the Public Works Department to be exempted from relocation, but this was not granted. They also petitioned the Taxpayers' Association for relief, and Secretary Tao Leqin received them, promising to handle the matter according to regulations. At the same time, they separately submitted petitions to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting protest. They planned to submit further petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for relief. Furthermore, shantytown dwellers in the Western and Northern Districts of the concession, feeling sympathy for their plight, sent personnel to express their condolences yesterday. It has also been decided to organize the Shanghai International Settlement Shantytown United Association to conduct negotiations.</p>
<p>For Life. The robbery portion remains at seven years, to be carried out immediately. Upon hearing the verdict of death, Gu's face immediately turned pale, he became stunned, and said nothing. The official informed him that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could still appeal according to law. Then, the bailiffs took the prisoner down and sent him back to the detention center.</p>

<p>Customs Adds Water Level Markings</p>
<p>The water levels at various ports along the Yangtze River, including Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wuhu, have risen again. Wuhu, in particular, has seen the sharpest increase. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has obtained the following information from the customs:</p>
<p>River Water Rises Again</p>
<p>The water levels at various ports along the Yangtze River, including Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu, have risen sharply since the first day of this month. By the fourth, they had begun to recede slightly. However, yesterday's customs report on the Hankou water level for the seventh showed it to be 30 feet 8 inches (compared to only 30 feet 5 inches on the fourth). The Wuhu water level report for the same day showed it to be 22 feet 9 inches (compared to only 22 feet 7 inches on the fourth). Thus, the water level is rising again.</p>
<p>Added Markings</p>
<p>Because the Yangtze River water level is rising, the customs attaches great importance to navigation facilities. Recently, water level markings have been added to the Hanjin Pass waterway between Hankou and Yuezhou. The markings consist of a white cylindrical pole topped with a black spherical basket and a non-rated red fixed light, called the Hanjin Pass Water Level Light Buoy.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Police Department was ordered to enforce the ban on opium, active publicity and strict enforcement have aroused the awareness of opium addicts. After the start of this registration campaign, the department expanded its publicity efforts and detailed the benefits and harms, which further attracted the attention of opium addicts. Therefore, in recent days, there has been an endless stream of people applying to the department for assistance in quitting. However, the municipal hospitals are already full and unable to accommodate them. As a result, dozens of opium addicts who applied to quit have been turned away daily because they could not be admitted. According to the department's statistics, from the start of opium addict registration in July of last year to June of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Huna Hospital cured 2,878 opium addicts (from April of last year to July of this year). The Shanghai Municipal Hubei Hospital cured 4,154 people. The Municipal Criminal Drug Rehabilitation Center cured 1,029 people (from September of last year to June of this year). The Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center cured 866 people. The designated hospitals that also handle opium cessation cured 883 people. The non-designated hospitals cured 1,098 people. The total is 10,988 people.</p>

<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter yesterday to the French Concession Police Department, stating: "Above is a summary. The homes of the people shall not be entered and searched without due process of law. The people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished without due process of law. This is stipulated by the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period of the Republic of China. The victim in question is a practicing lawyer, residing at No. 33 Shou'an Li in the Concession. There is no doubt that he is entitled to the protection of Chinese law. As for the reason for the arrest of his family members, whether it constitutes a crime requiring emergency measures, and whether it is a legal issue, we shall leave that aside for now. According to our association's special envoy Secretary Du Wenbin's investigation, the arrest procedure was not in accordance with the law. Your Police Department's actions are deeply regrettable in terms of legal dignity. Detective Wang A'da and another detective with a pockmarked face whose name is unknown injured the people, which is illegal and should be thoroughly investigated to serve as a warning. Moreover, our association is extremely concerned about illegal arrests. At the recent General Assembly, a resolution was passed unanimously stating that, in order to promote the spirit of the rule of law, all arrests within the Concession must be carried out in accordance with legal procedures and with the approval of the Consul-General. We hereby request that your Police Department rectify this matter and ensure that such incidents do not occur again. We also request a thorough investigation of the detectives who illegally assaulted the people and ask that you inform us of the reasons for the detention so that we can pass this information on. In the spirit of public friendship, we address this to the French Concession Police Department."</p>

The list of preparatory committee members from each district was reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, and opinion letters of the welfare association were prepared and submitted to the party and government agencies of this city for reference. Subsequently, the Rickshaw Pullers' Association sent representatives, Zhou Weigao and others, to the party and government agencies to request guidance in organizing the association to support the coolies, and they were all adopted for discussion and handling. Now, the preparatory committee members have made considerable progress after several months of planning. However, without capital, it is impossible to proceed. The Welfare Association is purely a relief organization, and its funds cannot be obtained from the rickshaw pullers themselves, in order to conform with the main purpose. Moreover, now, in the middle of the hot summer, epidemics are prevalent. The rickshaw pullers toil under the scorching sun, working hard and struggling to make a living. If they unfortunately contract an epidemic, the misery is indescribable. Therefore, relief is urgently needed to prolong their lives. The representatives, although exhausted and heartbroken, are powerless and can only call for responsibility. Under compulsion, we hereby submit this to your association, requesting that you act in the spirit of mutual assistance, immediately raise funds to assist in the good cause and meet the urgent needs. Otherwise, if we delay and if someone else has ulterior motives and takes over the planning, we fear that your association will regret it too late. Now, we are pleased to attend the first Executive Committee meeting of your association and request that you submit it to the meeting for discussion, quickly pass it, and implement it. Then, it will not only benefit the rickshaw pullers. We cannot express the urgency of our request and await your orders."</p>

He took a rickshaw through Jing'an Temple and transferred to Public Bus No. 3 to Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, intending to go to the Fanwangdu Railway Station to take the train to Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, when he got off the bus, the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau there, Zhao Fan, the deputy leader, Sun Rongsheng, led squad Xu Jintang, investigators Zhang Cailing, Li Pinquan, and Chen Delong to inspect pedestrians. They saw Pang carrying a small leather suitcase, his face flustered, and ordered him to stop for inspection. They found such valuable items upon inspection. Because he was hesitant, they thought he was suspicious and took him to the police station for questioning. He confessed to stealing on his own.

<p>Published by the Hongqiao Sanitarium in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Lung Disease Accounts for 44 Percent</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanitarium in Shanghai announced the statistics of the comprehensive physical examinations of citizens last month, stating that the hospital, in order to enable the general public to understand their own health status, improve their living conditions, and achieve the purpose of preventing diseases and early treatment, has added a comprehensive physical examination department. The monthly statistical report is as follows: A total of 64 citizens went to the hospital for examinations, with ages ranging from 20 to 40 years old, totaling 42 people, accounting for 65 percent. The youngest was 7 years old, and the oldest was 63 years old. The most common places of origin were Jiangsu and Zhejiang, accounting for 65 percent, followed by Guangdong and Fujian, accounting for 22 percent. The most common occupations were education and business, accounting for 69 percent. Women who were housewives also accounted for 19 percent of those examined, showing that women have also begun to pay attention to their daily health status. In terms of diseases, 28 people were found to have lung disease, accounting for 44 percent of the total. Among them, 25 percent had active pulmonary tuberculosis. The most noteworthy point is that the examinees had no symptoms. In addition, 12 people were found to have aortic and cardiac dilation, accounting for 19 percent, half of whom were over 40 years old. Several cases of droplet-like small hearts were also found. Furthermore, there were many cases of intestinal parasites, cystitis, syphilis, anemia, etc., found as a result of the examinations. The most noteworthy point is that the hospital's blood sedimentation rate test showed that the sedimentation rate was drastically rapid in the first and second hour for active pulmonary tuberculosis, renal tuberculosis, and syphilis, which was completely consistent with the results of other X-ray examinations, etc. It is worthy of being praised as the most useful supplementary diagnostic method. According to the average life expectancy of people in various countries in the world, Denmark is 61, Japan is 42, and China is only 30. Japan and China are of the same race and culture, but the average life expectancy and the strength of the country are almost proportional. It can be seen that daily hygiene not only affects the health of individuals, but also affects the strength of the country and the nation. Since the hospital began performing examinations last month, celebrities from all walks of life, such as Zhu Shaoping, Wang Xiaolai, Cai Jingjun, and Zhao Guanlan, have all visited the hospital, which is a good sign of promoting national health in our country.</p>

<p>Wang Shaoquan Returns to Daxin to Perform. The famous martial arts actor Wang Shaoquan previously played Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" at the Gengxin Stage. He was lively and agile and was welcomed by the audience. Later, when Daxin Amusement Park opened, Shaoquan left Gengxin and performed day and night at Daxin, gaining even more social acclaim. Later, because Gengxin was rehearsing eight episodes of "Journey to the West," and the role of Sun Wukong lacked someone to play it, a certain celebrity was invited to come forward and negotiate with Daxin to borrow Shaoquan for two weeks to perform exclusively in night shows, while he still performed in day shows at Daxin. It is said that the loan period has now expired, and the actor has returned to Daxin to serve, rehearsing his best plays and performing hard on stage day and night. Therefore, in recent days, the Pingju theater at the venue has been very crowded.</p>

<p>Sixteen Final Matches Today</p>
<p>The first round of the Kangdi Open Tennis Huacheng Cup Singles Tournament opened at the Kangdi Stadium at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The first week saw twelve groups competing, making it a grand occasion. Among the groups, the two groups of Xu Zengrui vs. Mao Hongfa and Colassa vs. Tang Baojia were the most exciting. The battle between Ke and Tang was even more intense. Tang used a bold and decisive hitting method yesterday, taking the first set with six against. In the decisive set, he lost due to a forehand error, and Ke won back with six against two. The situation in the final set was ever-changing. Tang took the lead with a score of three to zero, gradually becoming three to one. After four to two, Ke won four consecutive games, surpassing with five to four. Experts said that Tang's overall situation was gone, but who knew that after five to five, the situation took a sharp turn again. The battle for the eleventh game was in the last ball. Tang had an excellent opportunity to win, but he lost it because he was too hasty. In the twelfth game, after many deuces, Tang lost again due to a high-pressure shot, and finally lost with five against seven. As a result, Ke won with two against one. The second week of the game, a total of sixteen games, will be held today, starting from 9:00 a.m. Famous players such as Carson Skia will all play today. The results and order are as follows.</p>

<p>Strength Assessment</p>
<p>Regarding the strength of our athletes and the prospects for participating in this grand event, I have had several detailed conversations with several coaches over the past two days.</p>
<p>In track and field and swimming, although our results have improved rapidly in the last two years, there is still a considerable gap compared to the top athletes from various countries. I asked Mr. Ma Dehan what hopes he had for our athletes. He simply shook his head. If we must place some hope on one or two athletes, then it would naturally be Fu Baolu in the pole vault and Wu Bixian in the high jump. Baolu has achieved heights of over 4 meters, while the United States and Japan have five or six athletes who jump 4.30 meters. However, Baolu has a very strong fighting spirit and may be able to put up a fight at the competition. Bixian has a strength of 1.90 meters; the champion of the last World Games only jumped 1.97 meters, so let's see how he performs. In short, Mr. Ma's intention is that we should not be discouraged or ashamed by the inability to score points but should gain more experience and stimulation from participating, so that our country's sports can move to a new stage in the future.</p>
<p>According to Coach Dong Shouyi, our basketball players are very strong, but the participating countries are probably not weak either. The United States is widely recognized as being sure to win the championship, and the strength of South American countries and Canada is also formidable. This is because basketball originated in the YMCA, and South America and Canada have a long history of organizing the YMCA. In other words, they have been promoting basketball for a long time, and we are probably not yet their match. As for European countries, basketball has not been promoted for long, but their physiques are very strong. Since they have registered for this event, they must have been actively training for a long time, and their strength should not be underestimated. Therefore, our prospects are not optimistic. The only hope is that our team members can show their fighting spirit, play more games, and gain more experience. The order of the basketball competition has not yet been arranged and will only be known after arriving in Germany. We certainly hope to encounter a European team first. As for our lineup, it has not yet been decided and will be adapted to the situation, selecting players to fight. Mr. Dong has a plan in his mind regarding the deployment of the lineup.</p>
<p>In terms of Chinese martial arts, we have a total of nine representatives, but they are there for demonstration purposes, not for competition. When the reporter was in Shanghai, he met Mr. Feierhaosi, the China representative of the German Haitong News Agency. He had seen our representatives' performance and was very surprised and praised them. According to him, this visit to Germany will definitely cause a sensation, and after the Berlin performance, many other cities may invite them to perform. I told our athletes this news, and everyone was very excited and happy.</p>
<p>The four boxing representatives sent by the 32nd Army are generally not highly regarded. People assume that once they step onto the world stage, they will be beaten with bloody noses and fall to the ground. In fact, such a view is wrong. It is said that Commander Shang Zhen's promotion of sports in the army for only two years has not only greatly improved the soldiers' interest and knowledge but also produced great practical effects. For example, when they train soldiers to swim, there was a time when they encountered a large river while suppressing bandits, and the soldiers, having been trained, swam across the river to pursue and suppress them. They practice polo, which has resulted in all cavalrymen having excellent horsemanship. Even boxing, when two people fight each other, even if they are knocked to the ground, they must continue to resist as long as they can get up. This spirit of fighting to the last breath is of great significance to the entire army. Therefore, we should not take it lightly that these four athletes are sent this time. The strength of these four athletes is not very weak. They do not want to win any championships but only hope to gain some experience and increase the interest and skills of all soldiers in boxing.</p>
<p>Four representatives were also sent for race walking. Their results are not far from the world's top athletes, and maybe they will be a dark horse in this event.</p>
<p>The three weightlifting representatives have been training very diligently since boarding the ship, maintaining the nature of strongmen. Their results are not far from the world's top players either. It is of course difficult to predict whether they have any hope at this time.</p>
<p>The football team is still playing matches along the way and has not yet suffered a defeat, but when they encounter machine-like teams from Europe and South America, the chances of success are slim.</p>
<p>Now, the opening of the Games is approaching day by day. After the entire team arrives in Berlin, there will be a week of practice opportunities. The spirit of the entire team is very excited, and the fighting spirit is also very strong, which is reassuring to those who care about them at home.</p>
<p>Arrival in Singapore</p>
<p>This morning (the 2nd), I was awakened from my sleep by the noise. Everyone woke up especially early because we were about to arrive in Singapore. When I went to the deck, I saw many small islands on the sea surface. These were the long-admired Nanyang Islands. The seawater changed from deep blue to turquoise, calm and waveless. The mail ship moved forward slowly, showing a kind of peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, Singapore appeared before our eyes. Many tall Western-style buildings were arranged on the seashore like a long snake, exceptionally neat. Many giant ships were parked at the docks extending into the water, fully demonstrating that it is a transportation hub between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The ship docked around ten o'clock. Hundreds of welcoming overseas Chinese stood on the pier, all wearing white clothes and holding small party and national flags in their hands. When the mail ship approached, they shouted loudly, "Long live the Republic of China!" We leaned on the ship's rails and responded with enthusiastic cheers. The scene was truly exciting to the extreme.</p>
<p>Customs gave preferential treatment to the delegation, exempting them from passport inspection procedures. However, because we had to wait for all the other passengers to have their passports checked before disembarking, the time was delayed until 11:30.</p>
<p>The very bright sun suddenly turned cloudy as everyone was preparing to disembark. A gust of wind brought heavy rain, just like when we disembarked in Hong Kong. The delegation and the rain are probably very related.</p>
<p>After the rain, the climate in Singapore was very cool, not at all like the tropical climate we imagined. It is said that Singapore is very cool in the morning, with the highest temperature at noon only reaching 92 degrees, and dropping to over 50 degrees at night, all year round. Compared to the climate in Beijing and Shanghai, it is much better.</p>
<p>After disembarking, the entire group divided into dozens of cars, large and small, and, accompanied by representatives of the local overseas Chinese, paraded through the city in single file. Wherever the cars passed, the overseas Chinese cheered thunderously. Their concern for their motherland is so urgent that it is not easy to imagine without experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>Singapore is truly a beautiful city. The buildings are very neat, and the roads are so flat and clean that I have never seen them in China. In addition, it is evergreen all year round, without that desolate and bleak scene. When we passed through the botanical garden, the greenery was shaded and the grass was like a carpet, which made people feel lovely.</p>
<p>After a parade of more than an hour, we arrived at the "Great World" amusement park in Singapore around 1 p.m. Overseas Chinese organizations jointly held a welcoming meeting. Overseas Chinese representatives Lin Qingnian and Hu Changyao gave welcoming speeches successively. You Gengsheng replied on behalf of the delegation. Various organizations presented a "Glory Overseas" banner, which was accepted by Shen Siliang. After the ceremony, a public banquet was held, with Chinese food served. Everyone was tired of eating Western food on the ship, so they changed their tastes at this time and had a full meal.</p>
<p>After the public banquet, the overseas Chinese basketball team will hold a friendly match with the delegation. This letter is waiting to be sent. All the details will be reported after arriving in Colombo. (Sent from Singapore on July 2) (End)</p>

<p>Deliberating Three Measures and Ordering All Schools to Comply</p>
<p>Private schools in this city are numerous, and some regard schools as profit-making institutions, using various improper methods to attract students, even colluding with teachers in neighboring schools to entice large numbers of students to transfer. A group of unscrupulous teachers then use attracting students as a rare commodity to be hoarded and sold, seeing it as a stepping stone for advancement. Such schools and such teachers have a significant impact on the entire education system of this city. It is heard that the City Education Bureau has strictly formulated measures to suppress this: All schools must not use improper methods to attract students. If any incident of utilizing teachers from neighboring schools to entice students to transfer occurs, it will be investigated and dealt with severely without leniency. Teachers who are under contract must not transfer to other teaching positions without the permission of the original headmaster. If any unscrupulous teacher incites students to transfer schools arbitrarily, once evidence is verified, those who are registered will have their registration revoked, and schools must not employ those who are not registered. Schools that employ such unscrupulous teachers will be subject to severe punishment. All schools are hereby ordered to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Cotton Yarn Prices Soar Unceasingly; High Cotton Yarn Prices Seen Repeatedly <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yarn – 3.5 Yuan Higher Than the Highest Price Last Year; Cotton – Current Month's Chen Cotton Priced at 50 Yuan Less 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Rising Sharply, Falling Quickly</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and retreated in the afternoon. The highest peak for far-term yarn reached 219.8 yuan, exceeding the highest price of 216.3 yuan on December 4th of last year by 3.5 yuan. This was because American cotton continued to rise, and the new bulls took advantage of the momentum to advance fiercely, so the market price rose steadily. However, due to the high prices, retail investors took profits and sold, and although the bulls tried hard to pull up the market, the market price was inevitably affected by this.</p>
<p>The Rising Trend Only Stopped at Closing</p>
<p>The opening of standard yarn in the morning carried on the remaining power of yesterday's surge, coupled with the continued increase in American cotton. The bulls were elated, and the market price went straight ahead. The current month soared by 4.3 yuan, and the remaining months rose by 2.1 yuan to 3.1 yuan. The second session was firm, rising to 8 jiao. The third session rose by 7 jiao to 1 yuan due to the soaring price of raw cotton. The closing price for July to September was still firm. Unexpectedly, when it came to the October contract, scattered bulls took profits, and there was a lack of buyers for a while, and the market suddenly loosened, falling by 1.4 yuan. The November and December contracts fell by 2 yuan due to the virtual market sentiment in October and the rising selling trend taking advantage of the opportunity. As a result, the near-term price rose by 4.3 yuan to 4.5 yuan compared to yesterday's closing price, and the medium- and long-term prices rose by 1.6 yuan to 3 yuan. The second session opened firm in the afternoon, and after the third session, the price retreated by 1 yuan due to more bulls taking profits. As a result, the price rose by 1.4 yuan to 2.5 yuan compared to yesterday's closing price. According to the investigation, the sellers included: Chengji 1,050 bales, Yukang 1,050 bales, Hengyi 3,500 bales, Yuda 2,515 bales, Jinchang 2,050 bales, Mingde 2,100 bales, Shenchang 2,400 bales, Shenji 1,050 bales, Dachangcheng 1,500 bales, Changfeng 2,450 bales, Dachang 2,900 bales, and Yongdashun 2,400 bales. The buyers included: Deda 1,150 bales, Dafu 2,150 bales, Zhenda 1,450 bales, Hexing 3,900 bales, Yikang 1,000 bales, Shenji 4,350 bales, Taichang 1,700 bales, Jinghua 1,400 bales, Dachang 2,150 bales, and Tonghe 5,000 bales.</p>
<p>Yarn Threads Also Rose by 3-5 Yuan</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. The buyers from Xuzhou and other inland areas are more active. A total of 639 bales were traded. The market price rose by 3 yuan for yarn and 5 yuan for thread in the morning, and retreated by about 1 yuan in the afternoon. The purchase amounts of various areas are as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market rose more sharply due to the continued increase in imported cotton. The price of Chen cotton jumped by 1.85 yuan to 1.95 yuan in the morning, and the price of new cotton rose by 8 jiao. Unexpectedly, the yarn market retreated at the close, and scattered bulls took profits and sought to close their positions, causing a sharp drop of about 1 yuan. In the afternoon, the bulls re-purchased, and the price rose again by 6-7 jiao. However, the market turned loose, and it was not easy to advance, resulting in a rapid rise and fall of the market price. The difference between the various sessions was very large. The market situation was full of ups and downs, which was shocking.</p>
<p>Inevitably Affected by Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The opening of futures cotton in the morning was due to the continued rise in American cotton, which rose by another 24 to 37 points. Indian cotton also followed suit, continuing to rise. The morale in the standard cotton market was further boosted, and the bulls were very interested and pulled more fiercely. Chen cotton soared by 7.5 to 8.5 jiao, and new cotton rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao. In the second session, Chen cotton jumped again by 6.5 to 7 jiao, and new cotton rose by 2 to 4.5 jiao. In the third session, it rose again by 1 to 5 jiao, rising step by step, and the atmosphere was firm. Unexpectedly, the cotton yarn market suddenly fell at the close, and general scattered bulls closed their positions one after another. The August contract fell sharply by 9 jiao, the September contract fell sharply by 1 yuan, and the October contract for new cotton fell even more sharply, falling by 1.1 yuan in one session. As a result, Chen cotton rose by 9.5 jiao compared to yesterday's closing, while new cotton for October fell by 3 jiao, and the remaining months rose by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. After the opening in the afternoon, the bulls resumed pulling, and Chen cotton rebounded by 4.5 to 9.5 jiao, and new cotton also rebounded by 3.5 to 8 jiao. After the second session, the market was slightly softer due to frequent closing of positions by scattered bulls, but the trend of Chen cotton was still firm. The closing price was firm. As a result, Chen cotton soared by 1.15 yuan to 1.55 yuan compared to yesterday's closing price, and new cotton rose by 2 to 3 jiao. According to the investigation, the sellers included: Yuda 3,700 dan, Dafeng 5,100 dan, Mingde 3,100 dan, Gengfeng 4,700 dan, Yichengchang 300 dan, Shunkang 12,700 dan, Jinghua 2,800 dan, and Jinkang 4,400 dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Factories Need to Further Reduce</p>
<p>The demand for spot cotton factories continued to shrink, and transactions were very few.</p>
<p>Tuozimian 64.00; Yufeng Guangjin 100 Pieces of Spot Goods Sent to the Factory</p>
<p>The Yarn Exchange Adds a Special Deposit</p>
<p>The Yarn and Cloth Exchange announced on July 11 that from today onwards, a special deposit of 8 yuan per bale will be collected from both parties for new cotton yarn transactions, and a special deposit of 3 yuan per dan will be collected from both parties for new cotton transactions. The collection of both deposits will be based on one party. In addition, for the new cotton transaction in this month, a special deposit of 3 yuan per dan (totaling 6 yuan) will still be collected according to the same example, and the two deposits will be collected by one party.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Rising Trend of Foreign Cotton Yarn Remains Strong <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Dealers, shorts, Wall Street, New Orleans, foreign firms, and the public all bought in unison. Each month rose by 10 to 13 points. Afterwards, cotton farmers hedged their sales, Liverpool sold, and the bulls closed their positions, causing a slight reaction. Before the close, the public bought in, and the market became strong again. It is estimated that spot goods rose by 37 points, futures rose by 24 to 37 points, spot demand was good, there were not many sellers, and if the government loans for cotton were not released, the market situation could still rise. Textile activity was strong, and Hayes estimated that the factory used 207,000 bales this week. Liverpool's inventory was 289,000 bales. British spot cotton rose by 6 points, and futures rose by 17-18 points. Indian cotton futures traders and European exporters bought in, but the bulls closed their positions. Pingol rose by 1.75 to 3.75 rupees, Aumra rose by 2.75 to 3 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 3 rupees. Recorded by original telegram (10th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening prediction for the April-May Bairoxi flower on the 11th was 229.5 rupees, up 2 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 11th, futures yarn rose by 2.9 to 4.5 yuan, with near-term at 211.8 yuan and far-term at 208.8 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 1 to 3.05 yuan, with near-term at 76.2 yuan and far-term at 67.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Rises Again and Again <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was extremely strong due to the sudden surge in cotton yarn prices. The morale of the cloth industry was also very high. There were no definite selling prices for any goods, and actual sales were quite limited. The rise varied. White goods leader, the loudspeaker Tong fine cloth, slightly opened more than 300 bales in the morning, which was another 5 cents higher than yesterday. Afterwards, factories and experts, seeing the chaos in the market, were unwilling to sell again. The selling price of Dong goods and local factory fine cloth increased by 1.5 jiao per piece, light and heavy weight coarse cloth increased by 1 jiao per piece, and fine twill increased by 2 jiao per piece. The areas where goods were loaded were still Changsha, Hankou, and Yichang. A total of more than 600 pieces of various factory goods such as serge, zhigong, flower cloth, pongee, and local factory fine cloth and fine twill were loaded. Most of them were pre-ordered earlier. The printed flannel, medium pattern, small pattern, and water wave of Hengfengcheng Factory's products, opened this year at the same price as Guangzhong goods. Recently, 7-800 pieces of futures have been thrown out, with Hankou area alone taking in more than 300 pieces. Because the Yihe bleached cloth strips have not yet increased in price, the street took the opportunity to absorb more than 60 boxes of Jin Santablu bleached cloth and Wufu stripe bleached cloth yesterday. Yihe Factory's new flannel this year opened at 10 yuan per piece and sold very well. It has recently risen to 10.02 yuan, and it is said that it will need to be observed further for increases.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth Orders Are Exceptionally Sparse</p>
<p>Yesterday, woolen cloth transactions were sluggish. Export goods still absolutely require a customs duty payment certificate. All commodity prices were similar to those at the beginning of the week. The business of ordering goods from foreign firms is currently exceptionally sparse. No transactions were made by various British, American, Japanese, French, German, and Italian firms in Shanghai. The reason for this is that the shipping period is too late, coupled with the fact that local factory woolen cloth products are of good quality, and the prices have increased due to the sharp rise in Eastern and Western wool materials, leading to this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Grain: Non-Industry Purchases Are Very Strong <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Futures Wheat Suddenly Soars Again</p>
<p>The Increase This Month Was Still Slight Due to the Abundant Arrival of Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market, the prices for each month presented a uniform soaring trend. Because the quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada rose by 1 yuan to 1.1 yuan each, the morale was exceptionally high when the price opened. The increase for this month was only 5 cents due to the abundant source of supply. From August onwards, it rose step by step, from 9 cents to 1.2 cents or 1.67 cents. In this situation, because the powder price was restricted by the authorities, anyone with a flour hedge had to replenish wheat. Also, because of non-industry speculative activity, the suction was very strong, resulting in a sharp rise. By the time the afternoon market opened, the near-term market was also stimulated, continuing to rise by 4-5 cents from the morning. Transactions for September and later were still smooth, but the price turned stable, slightly up or down by 1-2 cents. If the foreign wheat harvest turns flat afterwards, speculative transactions will inevitably decrease significantly, and the market can gradually return to the right path. The current wheat market has abundant sources of arrival, but the price still has no ups or downs. However, because some of the goods handled by white-collar workers have now arrived to be protected, a portion of them are hedged into the exchange, so the transactions are not very smooth. The opening price for bird table wheat was 4.45 yuan, second-class was 4.42 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat was 4.25 yuan, Huaian wheat was 4.47 yuan, Nanjing wheat was 4.43 yuan, second-class was 4.28 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 4.32 yuan, Guazhou wheat was 4.42 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 4.43 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat was 4.44 yuan, Hankou wheat was 4.32 yuan, and Che wheat was 4.3 yuan, and wheat was 4.12 yuan, second-class to 3.95 yuan. Fuxin went to 8,000 bags, Fufeng went to 3,000 bags, and Shenda went to 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The US and Canadian crops continue to wither, and no rain is predicted. Although hedging sales are enthusiastic, the market is easily absorbed. The Canadian market situation is very strong. The government estimates that the spring wheat output is 126,000,000 bushels, and the winter wheat is 512,000,000 bushels.</p>
<h3 id="e186">There Is Still No Change in the Flour Market; Spot Powder Sales on This Street Are Gradually Improving <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the powder market in the morning and afternoon, there was still no change in the market situation for each month. Because the price has been limited, there is naturally no difference. However, the rise and fall of foreign wheat have been significant in recent days. For example, yesterday's quotation rose by another 1.1 yuan. The bulls could not help but think about buying in, so there were still more buyers and fewer sellers. However, brokers often settled on their own in order to facilitate the needs of both parties. There is no reliable information about over-the-counter transactions. The sales of spot powder from various factories are gradually improving on this street, and the price has been changed to 3.125 yuan to 3.15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sesame Sees Highest Price <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>New Wenzhou Beans Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>After the announcement from foreign firms that the import tax would be increased from August 21st (approximately 7-8 yuan per dan), the highest market price for foreign sesame has been 15 yuan in recent days. Due to the fact that there are no tons available to book ship cabins before August 15th, the market atmosphere has weakened slightly in the last few days. However, because the inventory is thin, there are still about 5-600 tons, and the market price must be 14.6-7 yuan, which has already reached its peak. Because there is no wheel loading and unloading, the pressing plants shipped more than 1,000 bags of Zhumadian beans and 2 carts of Bengbu beans, and the local street shipped 4-500 bags of Doudusha yellow. The second batch of new yellow beans from Wenzhou arrived with 150-160 bags. The goods are slightly expensive and need to wait for a good price to sell, so they have not been opened.</p>
<h3 id="e188">The He Xia Rice Market Is in a Slump <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various areas totaled 17-18 ships, with a total of 3,600-3,700 shi. Retail sales are still sluggish. Dealers from Dalian and Qingdao also only handled 7-800 bags of high-quality goods, so the market situation is very weak and seems to be in a slump. The price of thick early japonica rice continued to fall by a few cents or a jiao. The price of thin indica high-quality goods is still stable, while the price of medium and low-quality goods is also short by a jiao. The price of Duyang sharp rice has not yet opened. Although the sales of shade-changed yuan are sluggish, the sellers are unwilling to sell lightly due to the scarcity of goods, and the market has no ups or downs.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the remaining numbers from various sources in He Xia. The sales of various goods on the market were as sparse as the morning stars. The price of fresh white japonica rice was slightly lower by about 1 jiao. There were no inquiries for second-class goods. The price of thin indica rice with bright color was stable due to the scarcity of goods. The price of white yuan was high and stable, while the price of medium and low-quality goods was slightly sluggish. The price of Du bu kexian and other goods was also slightly lower by nearly a jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Weather Is Hot, and Ke Xian Rice Is Devalued to Seek Sales <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice arrived continuously, and the various Xian rice and foreign rice stored in the lines and warehouses were also mainly devalued to seek sales. Because the weather is hot, the stored rice inevitably has places to spoil. Unfortunately, the sales of this Ke Xian rice were weak, and the owners could not sell it even if they wanted to. Yesterday, the purchasing of inland areas and northern areas was even more sluggish. Transactions on this street were also weak. The total number of Jiangxi rice opened on the market was 736 bags, and Hunan rice was 390 bags, totaling just over 1,000 bags. In addition to the price continuing to fall by a jiao, if future sales remain as sluggish as before, it will be difficult for the rice price in the later market to turn around.</p>

<p>Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell; Final Situation Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was fueled by rumors boosting buying, with banks accepting bars, turning from weak to strong. However, with swap transactions approaching, there was selling to take advantage of the high prices. Ultimately, the overall trend was peaceful. Initial reports from overseas silver markets indicated that the British pound rose while the U.S. dollar remained stable. Traders claimed that those selling after the market closed would be quoted at the listed price, while buyers would receive a discount of 0.0625. Forward silver prices in Montreal rose by five to ten basis points. London gold prices fell by one penny. Exchange rates generally increased. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and U.S. currencies remaining stable. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged.

Internal trading fluctuated between 4.2-4.3 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower, initially weak, but later, due to soaring cotton yarn and flowers, rumors spread in the market that the market chips would soon expand. Major players jointly competed to buy. Although the HSBC listing remained stable, a certain bank also came to purchase bars, driving prices up to 8.5 yuan at one point. Many continued to sell to take advantage of the high prices. The Silver Equalization Tax was announced to increase by 0.25, but prices fell back. The overall trend reversed.

The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.375 for the British pound, and 30.09375 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was stable while the U.S. dollar loosened by 0.03125, due to the rising exchange rates. After the opening, banks traded among themselves and remained stable. Later, HSBC announced the official exchange rates, with both British and U.S. currencies remaining stable.

<p>Yesterday, market prices on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained extremely stable. Retail short positions were almost completely covered. The strongest long positions were in numbers 5, 13, and 32. After continuous gains for several days, market prices slightly loosened, and they immediately pushed them higher. Whether they had a small organization remains unknown. Yesterday's developments showed weakness at the opening, with both Type E and Type D down by 0.3-0.4 yuan. Later, major players stepped in and strongly forced prices up, immediately changing the market sentiment. The upward trend was strongest in Type B forward contracts, rising as much as 0.6 yuan, which was unexpected. Both Type E and Type D unexpectedly soared by 1.1-1.5 yuan. The following listings also rose uniformly. Retail investors covered short positions, and major players took long positions, sparing no effort. In the afternoon, a portion of number 32 was suddenly sold off, turning soft and weak, down slightly by 0.3-0.5 yuan. However, Type A had already stabilized, but at the closing, long positions held them up, preventing them from falling, and uniformly rose by 0.1-0.45 yuan. The trend was weak but actually strong. Unless there is a major ticket attack, it will not be easy to change quickly. As a result, market prices rose by 0.4-0.5 yuan to 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 10.097 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>—The market therefore remains difficult to develop—</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices rose, and market sentiment was quite firm. Unfortunately, actual sales were not strong, so Shanghai silk exports did not improve much. It is said that the drought in the United States is quite severe, and people's consumption of luxury goods will be somewhat affected. In Europe, the political situation in France is not stable, causing the silk market to stagnate. Yesterday, New York spot prices were $1.725, and futures prices were $1.63, up 0.03-0.035 from the previous day. Yokohama silk prices followed suit, rising slightly by 5.5-7 yuan. The Lyon silk market was dull and unchanged. In the Shanghai silk market, as manufacturers' sentiment became firmer, fewer goods were traded. For example, white factory silk skin was quoted at around 680 yuan, and even strong users and hoarders temporarily stopped buying. Transactions by foreign firms were even less likely.</p>

<p>In recent days, the Wuyuan Northeast Road Fine Eyebrow Green Tea has been arriving in very large quantities. English firms such as Jin Long Bao Chang and Tong Zheng are all searching and buying in large quantities, and transactions are unusually brisk. Top-quality, carefully selected goods are opening at 130 yuan, and ordinary goods are opening at 84-85 yuan. The market price is 2-3 yuan higher than before. Transactions in other goods from Tunxi, Sui'an, and other areas are also lively. The green tea market is becoming more stable, and the situation is much better than in previous years. Yesterday, Jin Long opened a batch of Lu He brand Ping Shui tea in small boxes and large bundles at 41.25 yuan. Hua Cha opened a batch of large boxes and large bundles of Guo Pin brand at 47 yuan. The wholesale prices were similar to before. Jin Long also bought 500 boxes of Lise Pearl Tea at 56.5 yuan, and the market price was able to hold. Red tea sales are still strong, and both English and Russian firms have large appetites. Yesterday, the market traded a total of more than 7,300 boxes of red and green tea, and the market was quite lively.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm. The association's opening price for spot 24 Dutch rough white and re-exported goods held at the original price. East White did not change due to foreign firms' willingness to ease prices. Numbers 48 and 9 remained unchanged. Local factory Mian Bai Zhen Ji Jin Xin Da Hua and other Number 1 were all 20.5 yuan. Zhen Yu Number 1 was 20.4 yuan. Local Bing Number 1 was 25 yuan, and Number 2 was 24.9 yuan. The price situation was slightly settled. Ordinary Mian Chi Number 1 opened at 13.2 yuan, which was slightly loose. Dozens of bags were traded, but this could not be considered the normal market. Jian Bang Da Lai Hua opened hundreds of boxes of standard Wu Fu White Ice at 18.7 yuan per stone. It is said that there is an intention to increase prices in the future. Also, more than 100 bags of Zhang Chi opened at 12.3 yuan. Diao Qing had not been traded for a long time, but yesterday 50 bags were also opened at 9.55 yuan, which was slightly higher than before. According to a telegram from Shantou, the exchange rate has fallen from more than 1310 yuan to more than 1270 yuan, and the combined price of Chao sugar has risen.</p>

<p>The Quanzhou new dried longan seedlings were very lush in the spring. According to a letter from a customer, it is now the time to bear fruit, but due to the drought, many young fruits have withered and fallen. According to the production area, if there are no other obstacles in the future, this year's harvest will be about 70% of what was previously estimated.</p>
<p>Since the opening rise of Sichuan pickled mustard, there was hope of stabilization. However, due to the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, the exchange rate in Guangdong and Shantou soared, making it difficult to match the price of goods sold, and sales greatly decreased. As a result, the opening price could not be maintained for long and has repeatedly fallen. Yesterday, it was reported that 2,000 batches were opened. Gao Le Qi pickled mustard was 24.5 yuan, and the price of the next grade was reduced. Pei Ling pickled mustard was 20 yuan, and the market followed loosely. It is reported that there are about 20,000 pieces in the Shanghai market, and the production area also has more than 20,000 pieces in stock. If sales turn strong in the future, there is still a possibility of a rebound.</p>

<h3 id="e197">On Diligence <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizhi</p>
<p>Diligence is the most precious treasure of life and an essential principle for establishing oneself. As the ancient saying goes, "A rope saw can cut through wood, and water droplets can pierce through stone." This is clear evidence of diligence!</p>
<p>There was a villager whose family was very poor, but he was very diligent and hardworking. Even in the scorching summer, when the hot sun made his skin feel like it was about to crack, he still worked diligently without stopping. In the bitterly cold winter, which everyone feared, he was not afraid of the severe cold and worked diligently as usual. After a long time, he gradually became moderately well-off, and later, he gradually became wealthy.</p>
<p>There was also a student who was very slow-witted. He always lagged behind in exams. Later, he felt ashamed and began to study diligently, day and night, regardless of the cold or heat. Over time, his knowledge made great progress. Later, even those who were more gifted than him could not catch up. Children, as long as one is "diligent," the poor can become rich, and the dull can become intelligent. Think about it! How great is the power of diligence!</p>
<p>Now is the age of scientific warfare, children! We should be even more diligent in using our hands and brains. You must know that only science can win and survive in the modern world, and science can only be developed by diligently using our hands and brains.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Story of Punctuality <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The Chinese have never paid much attention to punctuality. For example, when friends meet, they should arrive on time once the time has been set, so as not to break their promise. However, some are late, and some don't show up at all. I think children have personally encountered this kind of thing or heard others talk about it. There are also things like attending meetings and banquets. There are certainly some who can be punctual, but there are also many who are not. I won't say much more about that here. Now, let me tell you a story about someone who was criticized for being punctual, and as a result, the person who was late was the one who was embarrassed:</p>
<p>During the Later Han Dynasty, there was a man named Chen Shi, who was also known as Zhonggong. His virtue was admired by everyone. After he died, more than 30,000 people from all over the country came to mourn him, and more than 100 people wore mourning clothes. He had two sons: one named Ji, also known as Yuanfang, and one named Chen, also known as Jifang. Because they received a good family education from an early age, Yuanfang and Jifang were also very famous. Chen's family history has been briefly described. Next, I will talk about Mr. Zhonggong's story of punctuality.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Zhonggong and a friend agreed to go to a place together, and the agreed time was noon. However, when noon arrived, the friend had not yet arrived, so Mr. Zhonggong went alone. After he left, the friend arrived. When he arrived in front of Chen's house, he saw Yuanfang playing. At that time, he was only seven years old. He asked, "Is your father at home?" Yuanfang replied, "It has been a long time since I saw you, and my father has already left." The visitor heard this and angrily said, "He's not human! He made an appointment with me and left by himself." Yuanfang said, "You and my father agreed to meet at noon. If you don't arrive at noon, you are untrustworthy, and it is rude to scold his father in front of someone else's son!" The friend's face turned red after being told by Yuanfang. He hurriedly got out of the car and wanted to hug Yuanfang, but Yuanfang ran into the house and ignored him.</p>
<p>Children! Mr. Zhonggong did nothing wrong. His friend broke his promise, but instead wanted to call him "inhuman," so it is no wonder that he was embarrassed. Yuanfang was only seven years old at the time, but he already knew etiquette, which is also admirable. From this story, it can be seen that the habit of being unpunctual has been around since ancient times, and we should correct it ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Photography <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Min'er is a sixth-grade student in elementary school, and he has already graduated this year. Before graduating, the students felt that they would be separated from now on, so their feelings were very harmonious. They exchanged their own photos to keep as a permanent memento. Of course, Min'er also had many classmates who asked him for photos, so he decided to go to the photo studio on Sunday to take pictures. In less than a week, the photos were printed. When he went to the photo studio to pick up the photos, he had a big question:</p>
<p>"Sir, how can you put my image on this paper in a few seconds?"</p>
<p>"It would take a long explanation to answer that question. I have to tell you from beginning to end: The most important thing in photography is the film. Use a glass plate or a kind of soft paper, and coat one side with a kind of chemical medicine and let it dry. That is the film. What is the use of this film? Put the film in the camera box, and the thing you want to photograph will be directly shot onto the film through the lens. The chemical medicine on the film will change when it sees light. Moreover, the light is strong or weak, then the changes on the film will also be deep or shallow. But the changes are very small, so the image on the film cannot be seen. So you have to find a way to make it clear. Development: After the chemical medicine on the film is acted upon by the developer, all the places that have been exposed to light will change into a black thin layer and attach to the film. The stronger the light, the faster the decomposition, and the darker the color. Therefore, the brightest part of the scene is the darkest on the film, which is exactly the opposite of the correct image, so the image on the film is called the negative image. After the negative image is printed, there will inevitably be many unchanged chemical medicines on the film, so it cannot be exposed to light, because if the unchanged medicine encounters light, it will change again, and won't it ruin the film? So it must go through a fixing procedure. Immerse the film in a fixing medicine to fix the image, and then wash it with water to completely wash away the medicine on the film, and the changed medicine will still remain on the film. This is the black negative in your hand. To make the image into a photograph, you need a special paper. This special paper is made in the same way as the film. Put the negative on the paper and expose it to sunlight. The light-transmitting parts of the negative will change the medicine on the paper, and the non-transmitting parts will not change the medicine. In this way, the image on the paper will be exactly in line with the original scene. After such a complicated procedure, it can become a photograph."</p>

<p>— Ziying</p>
<p>Children: As soon as summer comes, many fruits are on the market: peaches, plums, waxberries, watermelons...</p>
<p>Many people teach us to eat more vegetables and fruits. Yes, fruits are not only delicious, but also rich in nutrients, which are very beneficial to our bodies. However, sometimes if you are not careful, they can be harmful. So we must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, do not eat on the road, because the roads are dusty and contain many germs, which is very unhygienic to eat; and there are many pedestrians, so how difficult is it to eat while running?</p>
<p>Second, the fruits sold by vendors on the roadside are inevitably attached to flies, so we should wash them with clean water at home before eating them. If you want to peel or cut them open, you must first pay attention to whether the knife used is clean.</p>
<p>Third, although fruits are good for the body, it is also unhygienic to eat too much. It is best to eat a little after meals.</p>
<p>Other things like: you must wash your hands before eating; rotten and unripe fruits should not be eaten; ...are hygienic.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Eight Principles of the Character "Yong" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Children! In addition to reading, you also have a writing course, which is also very important, because as your knowledge gradually progresses, your calligraphy must also be gradually practiced to be elegant and beautiful, so that the articles you write are clear and your calligraphy is excellent. But there are many principles for writing! I will now talk about the "Eight Principles of the Character 'Yong'!"</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, there was a great calligrapher named Zhang Huaiwan. He had a lot of research on calligraphy. He once used the character "Yong" as a ratio, calling it the Eight Principles of the Character "Yong". First is "Ce", which is also a point, meaning that a point should be slanted and not straight. Second is "Le", which is a horizontal stroke, meaning that a horizontal stroke should be restrained and have a pause, which is what the common saying calls "soft and hard". Third is "Nu", which is a straight stroke, and a straight stroke is "vertical", meaning that it must be done with force. Fourth is "", "pronounced ti", which is a hook, meaning that a hook is like a hook. Fifth is "Ce", which is a diagonal stroke upwards, which means brevity. Sixth is "Lüe", which is a downward-sloping stroke, and a long downward-sloping stroke is called Lüe, which is like a snatch, meaning agility. Seventh is "Zhuo", which is a short downward-sloping stroke on the right side, and a short downward-sloping stroke is called Zhuo, which is like a quick advance. Eighth is "Zhe", "pronounced zhai", which is a press, and the lower right side of calligraphy is called Zhe, meaning a slow movement. The Eight Principles of the Character "Yong" diagram is published below. "Some say that the Eight Principles of the Character 'Yong' was created by Wang Xizhi."</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Smallest Country in the World <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Shun</p>
<p>—and the Country with the Smallest Population</p>
<p>Children, perhaps you already know that the largest countries in the world are the United Kingdom (including its territories), Soviet Russia, the Republic of China...; the countries with the largest populations are also these countries. However, I dare to say boldly that you may not have noticed the smallest country in the world and the country with the smallest population! Let me tell you here, perhaps you would like to know!</p>
<p>The smallest country in the world is Monaco, which is known as the gambling country. It is in the southeast corner of France, facing the Mediterranean Sea. Its area is only eight square miles, and its population is only a few tens of thousands of people. Its political system is a constitutional monarchy. There is a national gambling house in the country, and the country's income almost entirely depends on gambling tax.</p>
<p>The country with the smallest population in the world is a small republic in the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe, called Andorra. The population in this country is only more than 5,000 people. The residents are Basque people who live by animal husbandry. It is located between France and Spain and is protected by the Christian priests of the two countries. Because the territory is all rugged mountains, transportation is inconvenient, and the customs still have a generational flavor.</p>
<p>Brief News: Starting from the sixth issue, Health Pictorial will publish "Medical Lighthouse" by medical scientist Zhu Peiran in each issue.

<h3 id="e204">Summer Camp for Children's Health Tour (Part 1) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In the past, I have visited both the first and second summer camps for children's health. I felt that they were not only summer camps for children's health, but also camps for children's happiness. Whenever I saw those innocent and lively little angels living leisurely in the camp, I always felt that these children were happy. I only regretted that I couldn't subtract twenty years from my age; otherwise, I would definitely try to join this paradise.</p>
<p>The third summer camp for children's health opened on July 5th. The location is still the old place from last year—Tongji University Middle School in Wusong Railway Station. Originally, I was planning to attend their opening ceremony, but it happened to rain in the morning. Although it cleared up in the afternoon, I had other matters to attend to, so I didn't succeed in going.</p>
<p>On the second day of the opening, although the weather wasn't "great," I decided to visit and, by the way, I also wanted to visit the Women and Children Relief Center!</p>
<p>The steam train carried me to Wusong Town, and I found the middle school of Tongji University quite familiarly: in front of the school gate, in addition to the school sign, a sign for the summer camp for children's health had been added. The layout inside seemed a little different from last year. The organization was also obviously more rigorous than last year, and the number of campers had increased by forty compared to last year, so all the facilities were more thoughtful than the previous two.</p>
<p>The location there is very good, with convenient transportation and a suitable environment. Moreover, it is bordered by the Wusong River to the south, the Ye Family Garden to the west, and close to the Baotaiwan Fort to the east. Therefore, the location is not only quiet and the air is flowing, but also the scenery is extremely beautiful. As for the inside of the camp, the grand auditorium is in the center. To the left are the classrooms, divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D. On the right is the sports field, with various sports equipment such as swings and seesaws. The barracks are in the back.</p>

<h3 id="e205">How Does Fanning Make Us Cool? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>In hot weather, everyone invariably picks up a fan and starts fanning, bringing a refreshing breeze that makes us feel cool and comfortable all over. How does fanning drive away heat and create coolness? This is truly a scientific question that needs to be understood urgently. Now, let me explain it in detail: When the weather is hot, we always sweat profusely. Naturally, most of the sweat is water, which evaporates into vapor and dissipates. However, when water turns into vapor, it absorbs a large amount of heat. Our body heat is lost due to the evaporation of sweat.</p>
<p>However, the speed of sweat evaporation varies with the humidity of the air. In other words, if the air contains less water vapor, the sweat evaporates quickly; if the air contains more water vapor, the sweat evaporates slowly. When we sweat, the amount of water vapor in the air around our body gradually increases, and the evaporation process gradually slows down. Our body heat cannot be dissipated quickly, so we still feel very hot. Conversely, if we fan a few times, making the air circulate, the air near us containing more water vapor flows away, and the air farther away containing less water vapor also flows closer to us. The air around the human body contains only a small amount of water vapor, and sweat evaporates naturally quickly. Our body heat can also be dissipated quickly. At this time, we will naturally feel cooler.</p>

<p>Mini Speech</p>
<h3 id="e207">We Must Learn from the Great Hua Mulan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Jifen, Zhujiege Elementary School</p>
<p>Speaking of Hua Mulan, you all know that she was a brave girl, right? But in China's long history, she can also be said to be a great national hero.</p>
<p>Hua Mulan lived during the Sui Dynasty. She had a father, a mother, an older sister, and a younger brother. Her father was a military general at home. At that time, she lived a life of weaving, which was very happy.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a foreign tribe on the northwest border who wanted to seize our complete territory, so the country greatly mobilized its troops, preparing to resist those strong and savage foreigners. The conscription notice also had Mulan's father's name, which made Mulan anxious for many days, because her father was already old and could no longer go out to fight the enemy. She had no older brother to replace her father at the front line. What could she do? She said to herself, "Just because I am a woman, can't I win glory for the country? Can't I replace my aging father in battle? No! I must go. For my father, for my country, I must try. But what I hate the most is this unenlightened society, which fundamentally does not allow women to go to the front line. If I wear men's clothes, wouldn't I look like a man?" As a result, she got her parents' consent, disguised herself as a man, and went on an expedition alone. Later, she fought the enemy, traversed thousands of mountains and rivers, and killed many enemy soldiers and generals. Ah! Mulan was extremely brave! She said, "I will resist to the end! I must kill all those enemy bandits." Sure enough, because she was bold and careful, she truly defeated the enemy soldiers, causing them to flee in disarray. Mulan won the battle against the enemy soldiers, was promoted to general, and led her troops back to the capital. In total, she had been away for twelve years and returned home with the emperor's praise.</p>
<p>Everyone! The story of Mulan? My speech ends here. So let's think about it: If people want to do great things, as long as they have courage and perseverance, they can achieve success. At the same time, whether male or female, they can equally achieve success in great undertakings. Mulan's service in the army in place of her father is a good example.</p>
<p>However, there are still some people who ultimately believe that women's abilities are inferior to men's: what men can do, women cannot do. This is wrong. What men dare to do, women dare not do. That is an even greater mistake. Therefore, teachers often say to us, "Your responsibilities in the future are very heavy!" Yes, in the future, women and men will have equally heavy responsibilities. In the future, when we grow up, we must also learn from Hua Mulan and have the spirit to bravely kill the enemy! Only then will no one dare to bully us.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Tale of a Loyal Dog (26) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Because there had just been a snowfall, Little Nanluo's footprints were indeed very blurred. One could faintly see that he was heading towards Anfan'er Town. Bodexi searched until midnight before entering the dark and narrow streets outside the town. This Anfan'er Town was also completely shrouded in darkness. Occasionally, a sliver of light leaked out from the window panels of people's homes. Sometimes, a group of people would go home with lanterns, already drunk, humming songs in their mouths. The streets were covered with snow, a皑皑 white. The tall, black walls and roofs were set off by the white snow. Everything around was quiet and silent, only the sound of the wind whistling louder and louder, shaking the tall poles of the streetlights.</p>
<p>Because pedestrians often walked past, disturbing the footprints, it was even more difficult for Bodexi to find Little Nanluo. However, it did not retreat and continued to move forward bravely. Although the cold wind was piercing to the bone, the solid ice pricked its feet, and the hunger was burning in its stomach, none of it could dispel its courage. It continued to advance, advance, enduring endless hardships, and finally followed Little Nanluo's footprints up the stone steps of the Great Cathedral.</p>
<p>Bodexi vaguely thought, "He ran off to see his beloved thing again." Although it didn't understand what this was all about, it held full pity and sympathy for Little Nanluo's passion for art.</p>
<p>That night, the Great Cathedral held a midnight mass. One of the doors happened to be left unlocked, perhaps because the worshipers were eager to return home and neglected to lock it. So, Bodexi followed a line of faint footprints and rushed into the door, leaving a lot of white snow on the dark stone floor. It walked all the way to the front of the altar and saw Little Nanluo, whom it had been searching for so desperately, lying stiffly on the stone steps. It quietly crawled forward and touched Little Nanluo's face, as if saying to him, "Did you think I was an unrighteous thing, and sought my own comfort by abandoning you? Did you think I was an ordinary dog?"</p>
<p>Little Nanluo gave a low cry and hugged Bodexi tightly. He whispered to it, "Let us lie down and die together. People do not need us. We are alone in this world." Bodexi crawled closer and pressed its head against Little Nanluo's chest. Its melancholy brown eyes contained two big bubbles of tears, expressing the joy in its heart.</p>
<p>The two of them lay close together in the bone-chilling cold. Gusts of wind swept over the river from the northern ocean, resembling ice waves. Anything that came into contact with them would be frozen. They lay in the middle of this huge stone cellar, which felt even colder than the snow-covered plain outside. A bat often flew in the shadows—a ray of light often shone directly on the rows of statues. Together they lay beneath the icons painted by Robens, motionless, as if they had fallen asleep because they were frozen by the cold. They dreamed of the happy days of the past, when they often chased each other in the meadows full of flowers, or sat together in the reeds by the water, watching the ships sail out to sea in the sunlight.</p>
<p>There was never a dark cloud hovering over the friendship between Little Nanluo and Bodexi, so they always loved and cherished each other and never separated. In their short lives, they had fulfilled their responsibilities and had not wronged anyone. They had never committed any sins in their lives, so they were very happy and satisfied in their conscience. They were attacked by both hunger and cold, and the blood in their veins seemed to be gradually freezing, but they were still dreaming of the happy times of the past, passing the long night.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Reasons for High Prices and Food Shortages in Germany <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yuanting</p>
<p>On September 4th of last year, the German government announced the highest prices for beef, pork, sausage, eggs, and other items, stipulating that the prices of these items should not exceed the levels of March 1935. This clearly shows that because prices in Germany were rising day by day, the Hitler government had no choice but to use orders to suppress them. However, this situation of high prices cannot be seen in the statistics of German officialdom. For example, the statistics of German officialdom in June, July, August, and September of last year are like this:</p>
<p>Such official statistics are based on several commodities with unchanging prices, made according to government regulations. Therefore, the prices of the general market cannot be seen in the middle.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in the current state of Germany, the real situation of high prices in Germany cannot be seen in general newspapers and magazines either. However, some German publications sometimes reveal a little bit of accurate information in a roundabout way. For example, the magazine "German Economist" stated: "It is obvious that the movement of the food index is mainly determined by commodities with unchanging prices (such as milk, bread, etc.), but the proportion of these items to food transactions is not decisive. Moreover, according to the report of the statistical authorities, the prices of items such as cheese, sausage, vegetable oil, and fruits are far above the statistical figures." If this is translated into very straightforward language, it means that the statistics of German officialdom are based on commodities with unchanging prices, and these commodities have no decisive significance for market transactions, so the statistics of officialdom are tantamount to deception.</p>
<p>In recent years, the price policy of the Hitler government has, on the one hand, prevented the official prices of grain from increasing, but on the other hand, it has made the prices of livestock feed rise day by day. The year before last, because the harvest was not good, grain was less than four million tons, and the increase in imports only supplemented 500,000 tons. This made grain even more scarce, and the price of feed naturally became more expensive in lean years. Feed, needless to say, is produced by the land, so its expensive price is of course beneficial to landowners and wealthy farmers, but on the other hand, it is a major blow to the lives of poor and middle peasants. Because raising livestock is the main sideline business of general farmers, the high price of feed has greatly reduced their income from raising livestock, sometimes even making this income fundamentally problematic. This is of course very distressing for them, who are usually very weak and poor. At the same time, the current policy of the German government also wants to limit the rise in livestock and meat prices. As a result, it is even more unfavorable for farmers who raise livestock.</p>
<p>Because of the high price of feed and the restriction of livestock and meat prices, the number of livestock raised by farmers has decreased accordingly, resulting in a great shortage of meat and oil. Taking pigs as an example, the number of pigs raised by farmers last year decreased by 10% compared to the previous year. The number of pigs used for slaughter also decreased by more than 15.9%. Recently, this decrease is still developing.</p>
<p>The lack of these kinds of goods in Germany can be seen even more in the imports of meat and oil last year and the year before last. Please see the table below——(Unit: 1,000 tons)</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy in the middle is the large decrease in oilseeds and other items used as the basis for the production of artificial cheese. Because these contain 35% oil, the reduction in their imports by that much means a reduction in fats and oils of 250,000 tons, which represents a deficiency of one-half of Germany's butter consumption.</p>
<p>But what exactly are the reasons for such high prices and food shortages in Germany? According to the official German explanation, it lies in the improved lives of the German people and the increased needs. An official magazine said: "We feel a slight lack of some agricultural products today. In fact, this lack is a good phenomenon. We must remember that for many important reasons, the demand for production has increased, and consequently, its consumption has also increased. If one examines the fact that 4.5 million people have returned to the production process, resulting in an increase in purchasing power, then this problem can be fully understood. In this case, the increase in purchasing power must first affect the food market." Thus, there is a great shortage of food, and its price is rising day by day. At the same time, the state-run Economic Research Institute followed the instructions of Propaganda Minister Goebbels and said, "In any case, a lack of food has occurred. But this fact is nothing more than an explanation of increased needs. This is also the same for bread and milk for drinks. At the same time, as a result of the increased need for milk for drinks, the amount of milk used by bread manufacturers has decreased. Naturally, the increased needs also include the increased needs of the military, but the main reason is still the increased happiness of the people." This also clearly attributes the reasons for high prices and food shortages in Germany to the increased objective needs and the improved lives of the people.</p>
<p>But in fact, as mentioned above, the lives of general German farmers are becoming increasingly impoverished because of poor harvests, high feed prices, difficulty in making profits from raising livestock, and heavy burdens of various taxes and levies. Their consumption capacity is naturally greatly reduced; the so-called improved lives of the people, increased general consumption capacity, upward purchasing power, etc., are completely the opposite for general German farmers. As for the laborers in the cities, their lives are also becoming increasingly impoverished. Facts tell us that in the year before the crisis began, the total income of German laborers was 44.57 trillion marks. By 1932, their total income was only 26 trillion marks. Comparing the two, it decreased by almost half. As for last year, it is said that the income of German laborers has rebounded to 31.76 trillion marks. But according to Germany's huge budget this year, German laborers will probably have to bear even greater taxes in the future, and their income will probably decrease even more; moreover, the German government's method of reducing unemployment is to exploit employed workers to provide relief to unemployed workers, so in reality, even if the total income of the laborers has increased somewhat, their individual income is decreasing. According to the "German Economist," published in Germany, the reasons hindering the revival of Germany's consumer industry are these two: "First, compared with the period of increased business activity in the past, wages have only increased a little; as a result, the total wage amount has only increased a little even with the increase in the number of employed people. Second, most of this income has flowed into the national treasury in the form of taxes." If this reveals a little bit of accurate information, then it means that the income of German laborers has not actually increased recently. In this way, since the income of urban laborers in Germany has not increased, and is even decreasing, and on the other hand, prices are rising day by day and the standard of living is increasing day by day, then their lives, of course, are becoming increasingly impoverished, just like the farmers in the countryside, and their consumption power is decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>Based on this fact, it can be clearly understood that the reason for the rise in prices in Germany is not the increase in objective needs or the upward purchasing power; on the contrary, it is because the increasing impoverishment of German farmers, workers, and general small citizens hinders the revival and development of the consumer industry, which is why there is a great shortage of general consumer goods and prices are rising day by day. In addition to this, there are two other major reasons: The first is the tendency of currency inflation, which artificially raises general prices; this phenomenon is obviously a major contradiction with the German government's policy of suppressing price increases. The second is Germany's active preparations for war and efforts to expand its military in recent years. This not only requires the storage of large quantities of food, which makes general food increasingly scarce and prices increasingly high; but also, due to the implementation of underground construction projects, airfields, expansion of civil aviation routes, development of various military industries, and compulsory purchase of anti-poison equipment, etc., in the active preparation for war and expansion of military equipment, the general consumer production is decreasing day by day. It can be said that the blood and sweat sucked from the general population is completely used in those non-productive enterprises for preparing for war!</p>

<h3 id="e210">Local Militia <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhanyuan</p>
<p>Tianxing Fortress is a high mountain near us, and no such strategically important fortress can be found within a forty-mile radius. I remember my grandfather telling us when we were little that when Lan Dashun rebelled, my grandfather's father and his peers hid in this fortress, thus avoiding disaster. Lan Dashun spent a month trying to capture this mountain fortress, but failed, which shows how dangerous Tianxing Fortress was. Even when we were little, when the "Red Borders" (referring to Yunnan soldiers wearing red-trimmed hats) passed by, this fortress became a place of refuge for nearby residents. Since the Republic's revolution, with wars and chaos, and the countryside being unsettled, this fortress has often been inhabited by wealthy families.</p>
<p>My life as a member of the local militia also began here. Although I have been reorganized into a regular army for two years now, the taste of being a member of the militia a few years ago still often brings back memories. It turns out that life in the militia was much more relaxed, much more enjoyable, and much more interesting than life in the regular army. It was definitely not like now, where I am bound by iron-like discipline and must absolutely obey orders. The situation back then was truly poetic, while now I am truly living a prosaic life.</p>
<p>I also didn't willingly become a member of the militia. In an era of rural bankruptcy and economic depression, there were always many unemployed poor people in the countryside who had nothing to eat. Besides becoming petty thieves, they also formed groups of three or five to commit robberies. The victims were naturally the local "gentry and taxpayers," but the people protecting the peace of the countryside were not the gentry themselves, but the strong young men from ordinary middle-class farming families who were selected and paid for by the gentry and taxpayers. Initially, training was only conducted during the off-season for farming. Every December, the "chief person" in the town would hold the "roster" of each village, selecting one out of every three men, or two out of every five, for training. This was called "door-to-door training," or "household training," which no one could avoid, except for wealthy families who could use money or orders to have their "tenant farmers" take their place. I was a son of a middle-class farming family, about to graduate from elementary school. During the winter vacation, I was inevitably selected for "door-to-door training." At that time, I was also very curious and eager to experience military life. Although household training only required "mustering" (meaning all the strong men gathering in the market town for drills) on days ending in "2, 6, or 9," when people "milling" around at the "temple clearing" in the town center, were "marching" in the group, chanting "One, two, three, four," it always felt like a taste of military life. Early in the morning, the mountain peaks at the edge of the village would echo with the sound of the copper gong. After the gong, you could hear a loud shout: "All registered strong men are hereby notified that the Yongxing Market Township Militia Office orders you to immediately gather under the banyan tree clearing in the street market to await mustering..." Soon, strong men of various colors from each village, carrying guns, wearing short shirts, and straw sandals, would set off from their homes and "rendezvous" at the market town. Our weapons at that time were extremely disorganized. Some carried "bird guns," some wielded spears, some carried iron rods, some carried "torches," and some carried "clappers." As for clothing, it was even more of a motley collection. Some naturally wore military uniforms, these were veterans who had returned home, they always held official positions in the door-to-door training, either as battalion commander, company commander, platoon leader, or at least as a "quartermaster," because they had all received formal military training. In addition, students from middle and high schools who returned home for winter and summer vacations also wore "student uniforms" or "exercise clothes," but the remaining many "ordinary people" had to make do with the blue cloth short shirts they wore for farming. Some people who often ran small businesses were selected, and because they couldn't prepare short shirts, some also rolled up their long gowns and tied them with belts. In short, the door-to-door training was the most diverse team imaginable. Its mission was to listen to the gong, gather in the street market, and wait for "drills," but it had no other use. If bandits really came, they couldn't deal with them, and they would also "turn a blind eye," pretending not to know.</p>
<p>However, when "winter defense" was tight, the door-to-door training, under the order of the "chief commander," had to brave the wind and snow to go out on patrol at night. I remember several years ago, when the situation suddenly became tense, I couldn't even study in my school anymore. During the day, I naturally carried a "rifle" and drilled on the field, and at night, I climbed up the hillside to "stand guard." I wore a "saber" on my waist, carried a gun on my back, and wore thick clothes. Together with three or five other strong men, each patrolled their respective intersections, and everyone knew the password of the team. I also carried "clappers" on my body, and if there was a bandit alarm, I would "whistle" or "shout," or heavily "knock on the clappers." In the woods, under the cliffs, I always had to endure until the rooster crowed before returning home.</p>
<p>Since I couldn't study anymore, and the countryside continued to be unsettled, I officially joined the newly established "militia" from the door-to-door training, also called the local militia, and was stationed at the strategically important Tianxing Fortress. Life in the local militia was much more orderly than in the door-to-door training. Every morning, we would get up at five o'clock, wash up in ten minutes, and gather on the training field in the faint morning light for morning exercises, and have breakfast at six o'clock. The day consisted of "three drills and two lectures," from five o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock in the evening. As for the uniforms worn by the militia, they were naturally much more uniform, and the firearms were also complete. There was also a fixed base, and the training was long-term. Tianxing Fortress was our barracks. There was a temple in the fortress, and each hall was assigned as the captain's office, soldiers' quarters, communication room, bugler's room, cook's room, etc. The captains were naturally soldiers or sergeants and platoon leaders who had retired from the regular army. The soldiers were selected from the door-to-door training. The militia could also receive pay. In addition to donating rice, firewood, and other food supplies every month, the "taxpayers" also contributed some money. Our captain could get three to five silver dollars a month, and we soldiers only got one dollar for pocket money, to be used for buying tobacco and straw sandals. All the firearms were donated by the taxpayers, and very few were purchased by the town government. The guns were mostly homemade breech-loading guns, with names such as "Nine-Shot," "Five-Shot," "Mauser," "Clapboard," and "Single-Needle." "Repeating guns" (i.e., pistols) were only available to the battalion commander.</p>
<p>Although we had three drills and two lectures every day, drilling marching, running, lying down, assembling, and disbanding, life seemed very tense, but in reality, it was very fun. Every Saturday, we could take turns going home. I could be affectionate with my mother, younger brothers, and sisters, whom I hadn't seen for half a month. On Sunday afternoon, I would carry my washed clothes back up the mountain, and occasionally bring some snacks, pickled vegetables, and meat to the fortress to "share" with my brothers. You could also apply for a leave once a month, to freely go to the "market" and freely go "visiting relatives." Every afternoon, after dinner, when it was still early, we would sometimes carry our hands and sing military songs loudly on the training field, such as "A man's first ambition is high, come learn military drills, brother holds the command saber, younger brother fires cannons, the white flag flutters in the wind, the war drums beat..." endlessly. Watching the houses far down the mountain, with wisps of smoke rising from the roofs, hearing us sing military songs, the children in the village would also come out to see, and after a while, they would also learn to sing with us. Sometimes we would also climb to nearby peaks to rest and chat. Looking down at the forests and the golden sunset reflecting on the mountains, watching the shepherds driving cattle and sheep back, we would play until it was dark before returning, and if it wasn't our turn to "be on duty" that night, we could play until late.</p>
<p>But every time the "market" season came, we couldn't avoid forming a team to go down the mountain, go to the market to "muster," walk a few steps in the crowd, pose in a few formations, and then return to the fortress. At night, if it was your turn to "be on duty," it would be a bit painful, especially when the "situation was not good." Every one or two miles, there would be a "sentry post" made of thatched grass on each mountain pass, and strong men would be stationed there every night. The militia would have to "inspect the sentry" every night, to see if there were strong men in the sentry post, and to see if they were fulfilling their duties. Sometimes they would also deliberately attack them to test their alertness. Sometimes, carrying guns, they would patrol in the dark snowy nights. Listening to the whistling of the wind in the mountain forest, the rustling of the snow, everything was silent. At this time, you would feel a little scared and a little lonely. But after passing the password and "meeting the sentry," you could sit on the warm grass pile in the sentry post and rest. There was tobacco, warm tea, and dry pancakes and sorghum wine, which the strong men were waiting for us to take and offer to us. The sentry post was filled with an atmosphere of harmony, a warm smell, not afraid of the fierce wind and snow outside the post.</p>
<p>In addition to our own team going to the market town to "muster," there would also be a "grand parade" every three or four months, probably gathering the militia from the surrounding four or five towns to drill together. We always looked forward to such an opportunity, as it was like taking a trip. During the march, we stepped in orderly steps, singing loud military songs, which echoed back from the mountains. After the parade, we could also receive rewards from the chief commanders or the director of the militia bureau.</p>
<p>The nearby people were either relatives or friends with us, and they were very harmonious with us and not afraid at all. If we occasionally needed some miscellaneous items, such as vegetables or rice straw, we could also send someone to the people at the foot of the mountain to ask for them, and they would all offer them without hesitation. Sometimes, when the situation wasn't tight, and our drills weren't strict, we could take time to go to the people at the foot of the mountain to do "farm work" for them, and they were also very welcome, and they would give us good wine and good food to eat. When it snowed heavily, we would also carry guns, blow "foreign horns," and go on "snow marches" with the children of the people at the foot of the mountain, and sing the "Snow March Song" together: "The mountain bugle blows, the people at the foot of the mountain open their doors. People at the foot of the mountain, don't be alarmed, we are not foreign soldiers, nor are we thieves in the mountains, but we are here to march in the snow, to fight and win for you in the future, and protect our four hundred million Chinese..."</p>
<h3 id="e211">Introduction to "Ice Cream Making Method" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>As the heat is soaring and the summer heat is oppressive, ice cream is indeed a wonderful product to relieve the heat. Now, the expert Mr. Wu Xinfa has published a book called "Ice Cream Making Method" based on his daily experiences, which describes the procedures for making ice cream in various flavors such as vanilla bean, thick soup, chocolate, walnut, strawberry, lemon, banana, apple, rose, egg, and cream, the preparation of spices and tools, the origin of bacteria, the identification of stale and poisonous changes, and the relationship with personal hygiene. The manufacturing method is simple and easy to understand after reading, which can be said to be self-taught. The whole book has eight chapters and seventy pages thick. The writing is clear and fluent. The actual selling price of each book is two dimes. The stationery departments of Shanghai Life Bookstore, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun Company all sell them. If you cannot buy them, you can directly send a letter to Shanghai Post Office Box 1737, and we will send them to you immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Solar Eclipse Observation <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The explanation of solar eclipses has always been very mysterious to the general public without knowledge. As soon as they see a solar eclipse occur, they either say that a heavenly dog is eating the sun, or that a demon is swallowing the sun; and immediately, they beat gongs and drums, hoping that the sun will recover, otherwise the human world will be in long-term darkness and there will be no light forever. If you want to say that this is superstition, then they will ask you: Why is it that after people beat gongs and drums and pray during a solar eclipse, the eaten sun quickly recovers? The sun being eaten and recovering due to prayer is clear evidence that the solar eclipse has supernatural effects. This is an absolutely unbreakable truth! Of course, people like these cannot understand the scientific significance of solar eclipses for a while, which requires long-term social education. At the same time, there are also some people who know a little bit about science, who also know a little bit about the astronomical knowledge of solar eclipses, but they do not understand the meaning of actually studying solar eclipses. They often ask such stupid questions: What is the relationship between solar eclipses and human life? What is the practical benefit of studying solar eclipses? This can be said to be completely a merchant-like calculation, thinking that scientific research is only beneficial and meaningful if it studies opening gold mines or invents things that can be sold for a lot of money, and that the study of solar eclipses cannot make a profit, so it is of course not related to human life and is useless. This kind of expression is really snobbish!</p>
<p>However, the actual study of solar eclipses can not only break general superstitions, but also has great significance for astronomy and even general science. For example, the observation of the solar eclipse in South America and other places on May 29, 1919, confirmed the Einstein effect, making his theory of relativity even more radiant, which is deeply related to general science and even world thought. Because the study of solar eclipses is so important, when a total eclipse occurs somewhere, astronomers and scientists from all over the world will travel to observe it, regardless of the hard work; if it is said that the study of solar eclipses is meaningless, then what are the scientists who observe solar eclipses for?</p>
<p>Partial solar eclipses occur three or four times a year, but total eclipses occur only every few years, and can only be seen in certain parts of the earth. Therefore, observing total eclipses is quite difficult; many famous scientists in the world believe that total eclipses are rare research opportunities, so whenever a total eclipse is about to be seen somewhere, they will spare no expense in money and energy, and go in organized and planned teams to observe it. The most recent total eclipse was observed in Siberia in the Soviet Union and Hokkaido in Japan, and more scientists went to study it than before. For a time, the so-called observation of solar eclipses became a major cultural news in the world.</p>
<p>According to past research, the so-called solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the earth and the sun, and sunlight is blocked by the moon; a total eclipse is the phenomenon in which the moon completely blocks sunlight in certain areas of the earth. This is already an undoubted truth. The current study of solar eclipses is of course not just to further prove this truth, but has new purposes and meanings. For example, the purpose of the recent solar eclipse research can probably be listed as these points:</p>
<p>First, study the solar atmosphere. The sun that we usually see with the naked eye is a large luminous sphere with a diameter of 1.4 million kilometers. Around this is the solar atmosphere; around this solar atmosphere, there is an even thinner gas body called the corona. Because the sunlight is very strong, we cannot usually observe this corona; only during a total eclipse is there a good opportunity to observe it.</p>
<p>Second, observe how Einstein's proposed light refraction actually occurs in the atmosphere?</p>
<p>Third, observe the relative movement of the sun and the moon to predict the future movement of the moon.</p>
<p>In addition, there are purposes for non-astronomers to observe total eclipses, which are to investigate: 1. the relationship between solar eclipses and cosmic rays; 2. how solar eclipses affect climate; ... and so on.</p>
<p>This solar eclipse started in the Mediterranean Sea, crossed Siberia, proceeded along the northeast coast of Hokkaido, and ended in the Pacific Ocean. The total eclipse time in Siberia was two and a half minutes, and in Hokkaido it was one minute and fifty seconds, so observation was quite difficult. However, due to modern observation equipment, the observation results have obtained many valuable materials; after these materials have been sorted and studied for a long time, they will be published and will correctly answer the above-mentioned questions, thus having a significant impact on science and world thought. In this way, who can still say that this is useless compared to past general solar eclipse research?</p>

<h3 id="e213">Mount Emei <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Jiangnan region has very few mountains; as far as the eye can see, there are endless open fields. People who grow up in these fields, apart from visiting Mount Hui in Wuxi and Tianzhu in Hangzhou, can only appreciate the charm of mountains through books and paintings. However, if you enter Sichuan, you are guaranteed to encounter mountains similar to Mount Hui and Tianzhu everywhere. Just sitting on the bow of a boat and looking at the majestic cliffs on both sides of the Wu Gorge is enough for you to savor, let alone disembarking and continuing west?</p>
<p>The ancients said, "The Jian'ge Pass is the most dangerous place in the world, and Mount Emei is the most beautiful." We will not concern ourselves with how dangerous the Jian'ge Pass is for the time being; we will now look at how beautiful Mount Emei is.</p>
<p>To climb Mount Emei, you must first take a boat. Now, motorboats can reach Jiading directly. Looking at the towering mountains on both sides of the Min River from the motorboat, you will feel like you have already entered the mountains and are already climbing. The water of the Min River is as swift as the streams in the valleys, and the color of the water is as clear as the water in the caves. The forests on both banks hang directly from the mountain ridges and cliffs to the riverbank. Before noon, the sunlight will not shine on the motorboat sailing on the river. It is like entering the Shanyin road, with strange grasses and trees on both sides, the songs of birds, the cries of monkeys, and the whistling of pines along the eaves, accompanying the small boat.</p>
<p>Disembark and head straight to Emei County. You can take a car, a sedan chair, or a rickshaw. But it is best to take a rickshaw, because the scenery along the way can only be fully appreciated if you travel slowly. Before reaching Mount Emei, you will pass many smaller Mount Emeis that are just as beautiful. We do not know why the mountains in western Sichuan are so beautiful. They are naturally dangerous, but they do not appear crude or terrifying at all, and they have the curves of a young maiden. The trees on the mountains are naturally lush and dense, but they are always arranged sparsely and evenly, with no crowded or isolated spots, and no bare mountains. The best thing is the water in the mountains: streams, ponds, and waterfalls. You can hear the sound of water at any time by the stone steps and in the forests. The leaves and petals of every mountain peak can flow into the great river below.</p>
<p>Mount Emei is a sacred place, as famous as Mount Wutai in Shanxi and Putuo in Zhejiang. The construction of roads and temples throughout Mount Emei, if not for the power of the Bodhisattvas, could not have achieved such results as they have now, right? There are no fewer than one hundred and several dozen temples on the entire mountain, and the roads built up and down, just the main roads alone, are more than one hundred li long. But is it the spirit of the gods or the power of the people? For example, every year, no fewer than tens of thousands of people from all over the country go to "pay pilgrimage to Mount Emei." Especially in the hot summer, travelers go to escape the heat, and pilgrims go to celebrate the "Ghost Festival in July." Therefore, there is an endless stream of travelers along the way. People who "burn incense" have a yellow cloth "pocket" tied around their waists, a large "bundle" on their backs, and some hold "walking sticks" while others knock on wooden fish. Moreover, among the pilgrims, there are more women than men, and more elderly people than young people. The 120-li-high Mount Emei takes them several or ten days to travel back and forth. The temples on the mountain rely entirely on the "merit money" and "incense money" donated by the pilgrims to maintain themselves. In addition, they can earn some money by providing food and lodging for guests. Mount Emei does not produce much grain, and almost all the thousands of monks on the mountain depend on the guests for a living.</p>
<p>Once you arrive at Baoguo Temple, the climb begins. At the foot of the mountain, the mountain path is still very flat and wide. Looking up, you can only see the cloud-covered peaks, and only faintly see the mountain peaks peeking out from the gaps in the clouds. Except for the mountain paths, forests, temples, and pedestrians within the nearest few li, which you can vaguely distinguish, the surrounding and upper mountain peaks are all buried in the sea of clouds. The mountain road is winding, because the higher you go, the steeper the mountain becomes, so the path has to meander and spiral upwards. People traveling together in front sometimes cannot see those behind, and those behind cannot see those in front. Many temples are hidden in the dense forests, and you will only discover them when you reach them. It truly fits the saying, "Just when you think the mountains and rivers have ended and there is no road, willows darken and flowers brighten to reveal another village." A huge Buddhist hall stands quietly and solemnly in the mountain valley and forest. Inside, all is silent, and only the sound of the wooden fish can be heard. This sound, with its rhythm, echoes back from the opposite mountain.</p>
<p>The steeper the mountain, the higher you go. Once you reach Snake's Retreat and Ninety-Nine Turns, it is probably the steepest it can get, right? What is called "Snake's Retreat"? It means that even snakes cannot climb up from here; even if they do, they will slide back down. Ninety-Nine Turns means that the mountain road twists and turns ninety-nine times within four or five li. People who cannot walk uphill hire "porters." The "porters" carry a "back frame" on their backs, placing the guests on their backs and climbing up the mountain. Because the mountain is so steep, they cannot use "sedan chairs" carried by two people, but can only use "back frames" carried by one person. The scenery behind Mount Emei and below the mountain, you cannot look up at the scenery above and to the left and right. Because if you are not careful, you will fall from the ten-thousand-zhang cliff. But when you reach the stone steps that are slightly wider, you will go into the deep valley. Looking at the deep ravines and cliffs below, your head will spin and your eyes will blur. However, the porter does not care; he can move and turn the back frame at will. At this time, your life is completely entrusted to the porter.</p>
<p>Once you reach Elephant Washing Pool and Nine Elders Cave, you have gone halfway up Mount Emei, and it has probably taken a day and a half or two days. There are many caves and pools on Mount Emei, but the most famous cave is Nine Elders Cave, and the most famous pool is Elephant Washing Pool. Nine Elders Cave is nine li deep. We only actually explored three li of it, and the path inside became very narrow, requiring torches to walk. Along the way, there are clear pools of water. It is said that this cave can lead directly to the back of the mountain, but no one has ever walked through it, for fear of encountering pythons inside. Above Nine Elders Cave and below Elephant Washing Pool, there are many monkeys along the way, coming out of the forests in groups, begging for food such as bread from passing guests. They are not afraid at all, and sometimes even steal the clothes of lone travelers. After passing Elephant Washing Pool, the climate is completely different from that down the mountain. If you go to Mount Emei in the hot summer, you can experience the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. At the foot of the mountain, it is summer; at the waist of the mountain, it is spring and autumn; and at the top of the mountain, it is winter. Even in the height of summer, you must prepare cotton-padded clothing to go up the mountain.</p>
<p>After passing Prince Terrace and Founder Hall, you will reach the Golden Summit. Once you reach the Golden Summit, it is only four or five li from the summit, and you can overlook the entire mountain from here. Looking straight down from the summit, you can see that the many mountain peaks below are like lotus petals, heavily surrounding the main peak, like stars surrounding the North Star. Half of the mountain below is buried in clouds and mist. There are many ridges, near and far, appearing and disappearing from time to time, like islands in the sea or fishing boats drifting on the sea. White clouds form piles, one after another, like white cotton. Down the mountain, the sound of thunder comes from the sky, but at the summit, you only hear the rumbling thunder rising from under your feet. From the Golden Summit, walk dozens of steps to the Cloud Viewing Platform. In the afternoon, when the sun is setting, if you stand on the Cloud Viewing Platform and look out, you can see various wonderful Buddhist temples and statues appearing in the sky above Mount Emei, shining with golden light and dazzling the eyes. Behind the Cloud Viewing Platform is the Body Offering Cliff. Climbing up and standing on the cliff, you can see a ten-thousand-zhang-deep ravine with no bottom in sight, causing the mind to tremble. It is said that if you jump down from here, you can instantly become a Buddha, so it is called the Body Offering Cliff. The air at the summit is thin, and there is often cloud and rain. The entire day is filled with mist, with no clear sunny days. When there are many tourists, if everyone shouts loudly or beats the pilgrimage gongs and drums, fine drizzle will immediately fall from the sky. This is due to the thin air and very low air pressure. Therefore, water will not boil when heated at the summit.</p>
<p>From the Golden Summit to the Thousand Buddha Summit, and from the Thousand Buddha Summit to the Ten Thousand Buddha Summit, you have reached the absolute peak of Mount Emei. Once you reach the Ten Thousand Buddha Summit, you will feel that this peak is too lonely, because most of the peaks below are hidden and do not appear, or if they do appear, they are far away, low, and insignificant, unable to stand alongside it. As for the other mountains outside Mount Emei, no matter whether you use your naked eyes or a telescope, you cannot see them. However, on a slightly clearer day, you can see very far, even to the foot of the mountain, the town of Emei at the bottom of the mountain, the Min River dozens of li away, and even many villages. It is best to do it at night. Even at night, the summit is not very dark, perhaps because it is closer to the starlight. In this half of the sky, there is silence and vastness, as if detached from the human world. Below the mountain, there are countless bright lights, scattered like the stars in the sky. Especially at Puxian Temple, you can see even more. As the saying goes, "Ten thousand bright lamps pay homage to Puxian." During the day, you cannot see anything below the mountain; the clouds and mist separate everything below from above. At night... (continues on page 5)</p>
