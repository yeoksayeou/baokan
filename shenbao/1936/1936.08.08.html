<h3 id="c51">英日果能合作麽 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>這幾天東京方面盛傳英日兩國將以開發中國經濟為中心。進行合作。而倫敦方面。這類消息却很沉寂。</p>
<p>英日的經濟利害儘管怎樣的不易調和。為了過去傳統的友誼。日本對英仍有依戀難捨的餘情。而英國似乎也還未能忘情於「英日同盟」的舊夢。想由對中國問題的妥協。進到對全亞洲全世界問題的妥協。這是不錯的。</p>
<p>但是。事實證明着這始終不過是夢想。九一八以後。日本大陸政策的挺進。使英國在遠東的經濟利益受着重大的打擊。而英國則採取遷就的政策。以英人李頓為領袖的國聯調查團報吿書所提出的解决東北問題的方案。實際上是偏重日本的利益的。乃日本不但置之不理。且復一意孤行。使英國在遠東的利益。受到更重大的打擊。去年九月英國羅斯爵士來華。為調整英日在遠東的經濟利害起見。特繞道東京。以冀博得日本當局的諒解和合作。結果。為日本當局所拒絕。六月。羅斯二次東渡。重伸前議。又碰了壁。英國雖有一再向日曲意求歡的意思。但卒為日本獨占東亞的大慾所粉碎。這使它對日本不得不有所準備。三數年來。它在長江以南。以至西太平洋。對於一切軍事經濟工作。很是努力。最近在香港新嘉坡一帶。又積極擴充着軍備。建設着防禦工程。這就是它對日本的具體表示。</p>
<p>所以從最近歷史的演變看來。除非日本肯放棄獨占東亞的大慾。英日合作是難以期望的。但這幾天來。英日合作的呼聲。却盛傳於東京。是甚麽緣故呢。難道日本眞肯放棄獨占東亞的大慾嗎。在我們看來。最近日本軍肅運動。已經吿一段落。少壯軍人被判罪刑的很多。軍部為今後對於部下的統制。不再發生甚麽問題起見。不得不鞭策政府。實現他們平日的若干主張。可是廣田內閣預約的「庶政一新。」範圍實在太廣。難以如數兌現。於是祗好在外交方面努力。做些成績出來。以圖保全政府的地位。所以它想對英國提出。　日本對華並無侵略領土的野心。　日本尊重英國在華的旣得權益。為的是要承認日本所謂東亞安定勢力的特別地位。這才可以積極推行其所謂「積極自主」的對華外交。這大約還不過是它片面的意旨。英國那裏會輕易接受呢。然而這終究是很値得注意的問題。因為這對於中國的影響太大了。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>（八）百貨店</p>
<p>在參觀大阪每日新聞社這一天，我們到過大阪的兩家大百貨店。</p>
<p>這天早上，雨下得很大。我們走出旅館來，看到這一大都市的雨景，另有一種情味。街上的行人們，男的女的，大都踏着高高的木展，戴着紙傘或是布傘，像我們這樣穿雨衣的少得很。一切汽車的輪胎外邊都掛着橡皮條，或是棕刷，免得行駛時候，使馬路上的泥水濺到行人的身上去。</p>
<p>我們要到旅館相近的阪急百貨店去看看，必須穿過大阪車站前面那條車輛密集着的闊馬路。大雨時候要過這樣的馬路該是一件難事吧，然而大阪市的完善的交通管理制度却使我們能够不慌不忙地走過去。大阪市街上的交通警察少得很，交通秩序全是用機械來維持的。馬路上的信號燈有紅綠黃三種，靠電氣的自動裝置，輪流地亮着。馬路上還有連串的大銅釘劃定着橫斷步道。行人們可以等綠燈亮的時候，從橫斷步道穿過馬路去。膽大一點的在黃燈亮的時候穿過去也不要緊。</p>
<p>一進坂急百貨店的門就是一個極大的穿廳。很多的人們在那里來來去去的走着。從那里進去，就是阪神高架電車站。這電車站不久可以跟相隔幾十公尺的大阪車站打通，現在兩者之間的地下道工程正進行着。我們在穿廳上了電梯，在阪急百貨店的各部門飽覽了一切。這百貨店的規模似乎比上海的先施永安大得多，只是沒有附設先施永安那樣的旅館和遊戲塲。各部門的貨物都有着很多的花色。看去百分之九十以上全是本國貨。日本的產業發展到怎樣的程度，從那里就以可得到相當的認識了。這百貨店裏有繪畫展覽塲有人形陳列室，有十錢均一五十錢均一的特賣塲，有一小時內可以取件的攝影室，最可注意的是七樓的大食堂。</p>
<p>這大食堂佔有七樓房屋的全部，用低廉的價格售賣着日本式中國式和西洋式的　　　食物。非常宏敞的廣廳里擺滿着大大小小的食桌，容得下二三千的食客。鬥口兩列玻璃櫉里陳列着五顏六色的各種飮食品，一一標示着名目和定價。一客咖啡只賣五錢。一客西洋Lunch（簡易餐）只賣三十錢。中國食品也有幾種花樣如蛋炒飯，支那麵之類。支那Lunch這一種名目，最奇特。這是一大盤夾雜的小菜和一大碗白飯，定價三十錢。我們走進食堂去，正在中午的時候。食堂裏擠滿着人們。我們找了好一會，才在一張大桌子旁邊找到了兩個空座位。於是一個女給仕走過來，把我們所要呌的飮食品的價値算一下，給我們到門口櫃上的一個女掌櫃買來幾張小小的食券，（這食券共分十來種，從五錢到五十錢）因為照那里的規矩是先付賬後吃的。不幾分鐘我們所呌的飮食品就從廚房窗口搬到我們的面前了。</p>
<p>用過了午餐，我們走出阪急百貨店。下午參觀了每日新聞社以後，坐電車到南區難波新地去。</p>
<p>大阪電車的車費同日本其他各大都市一樣，採取着均一制。不論遠近，單程七錢，來回十四錢。車上的賣票員都是女子，對乘客服務十分周到，每到一站就高呼站名，請要下車的下車，等到車開了，又報告次站就是什麽了，請要下車的準俯着。乘客下車時，賣票員把車票收回去撕掉。如果要換車，她就另給一張畫有電車路綫的較大的車票，在目的地和換車地的站名上打了洞。乘客照這車票上的路綫去換車是很方便的。</p>
<p>我們在難波新地看到了純日本風的街景。這是大阪南區的熱鬧中心之一。街路不很寬闊，兩旁日本式的房屋居多。我們在街路上閑踱了一會，順便走進那方面最宏壯的一所大厦，『南海高島屋』去。這家大百貨店內部的布置同阪急百貨店相彷彿，不過高價的貨物似乎沒有阪急那樣的齊備。</p>
<p>大阪全市的大百貨店，除了阪急和南海高島屋以外，還有五家，就是三越，大丸，十台，松坂屋和高島屋。這些大百貨店沒有一家小是從吳服店（綢緞布疋商店）擴充的。營業年年的發達赶來，使一般的小商店在營業上受到極大的打擊？近年來小商店方面組織了公會，靠團結的力量來抵抗大百貨店的勢力。百貨店業因此也組織了公會，造成百貨店的聯合陣綫。在雙方營業競爭到白熱化程度的時候，大阪府廳，市廳和商工會議所是常常出面來調停的。</p>

<p>（倫敦）此間政界人士、對於關係各國商訂「不干涉西班牙內亂」協定之前途、頗抱悲觀、第一、自意國方面言之、該國政府對於法國建議、在原則上雖表贊同、但當提出三項問題、要求法國加以答復、即（一）對淤西班牙交戰團體之一方、若在精神上表示同情、例如示威行動·報章宣傳·捐欵相助·暨志願投効之類、是否等於干涉該國內亂、（二）不干涉協定、是否將由關係各國普遍參加、又是否僅是拘束簽字各國政府、抑或對於各該國人民暨私營事業、同時適用、（三）法國政府、是否擬採取監察辦法、以保障各國一致遵守不干涉協定、此問政界人士以為、墨索里尼若果提出此等問題、作為該國加入未「不干涉」協定之條件、則法國建議、必歸失敗、影響所屆、國際緊張局勢、亦必突趨嚴重、此實至堪憂慮者也、目前法國政府、為免談判失敗起見、自當申請意國政府、改變態度、此在英國政府、亦將訓令駐意大使德魯蒙爵士、向意國政府力事陳說、俾為法國主張作聲援云、第二、縱使意國對於不干涉協定、樂於參加、德國態度仍不可知、傳聞該國亦將提出類似問題、以為加入協定之條件、此外、該國政府國社黨靑年黨員、被西國共產黨人槍斃之故、已向西國政府提出抗議、若西國政府、不能予以滿意答復、德意兩國、勢將公然援助西國叛黨、誠如是、則「不干涉」協定之談判、愈難望其成功矣、據此間消息靈通方面所慮、西國政府對於外僑安全、已難妥為保護、萬一傷害外僑事件、再度發生、則德意兩國自必出而干涉也、第三、蘇聯聞將要求若干國家、對於西國叛軍、立即停止援助、此項要求顯係針對德意兩國而發、綜上觀之、英法兩國雖抱妥協態度、務竭全力、使默洲不致分裂為法西斯主義與反法西斯主義之兩大集團、無如此項企圖恐終將歸於失敗也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）西班牙亂事日來發展形勢、足使國際時局愈臻惡化、英國人士至感憂慮據每日民聲報載稱、德國東菲航綫所屬汽船「烏薩拉」號、載有轟炸飛機二十八架、機關槍及彈藥一批、駕駛員與工程師多員、名為開往束菲洲、實係送往西班牙叛軍領袖弗朗哥將軍、此訊發表之後、一般人士憂慮自益加甚、此外、西國巴塞洛那城德國國社黨靑年黨員四名、日前被西國共產黨處死之後、德國駐該城領事柯赫爾、業向加泰隆自治省政府、提出抗議、英國某方面人士、深恐德國悍然佔領西屬米諾加島、（屬於巴列亞爾羣島）以為獲得滿意答復之保障、又弗朗哥將軍、似有阻止西國政府軍艦、駛入國際中立地丹吉爾港之意、此在法國、恐難聽任弗朗哥為所欲為、因而發生糾葛、凡此均英國人土所慮者也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（中央社世運會特派員無綫電廣播報吿）世運大會中日籃球比賽、於七日下午六時在柏林舉行、中國政府代表戴傳賢·王正廷·大使程天放·及留德學生六七百人、均到塲參觀、同時並有拉拉隊數十人、化裝入塲助威、記者播音時、國內聽衆耳際所聞之雄壯聲響、卽我方拉拉隊助威之聲浪也、因昨日大會共有十六塲競賽、致較原定時間稍遲、中國兩隊在秘魯與埃及賽畢後開始、</p>
<p>我隊陳容</p>
<p>每隊祇許七人入塲要我正式陳綫為右鋒牟作雲、左鋒王鴻斌·中鋒王玉增、右衛王南珍·左衛李紹唐、後備沈聿恭王十選、時天作微雨、日人身材均甚矮小、但中鋒則較我長出半頭、目架眼鏡、我敎練董守義因病未出塲、由馬約翰李淸安主持、</p>
<p>我開紀錄</p>
<p>我首擇得地權、開賽後、日跳球得利、但為我方截獲、牟作雲王鴻斌王玉增數决傳遞、直入敵境、王玉增舉手一投、掠籃而過、日方卽行反攻、小心翼翼、混戰聲中、我方採用短急傳遞、無如敵人嚴陣以防、牟作雲兩次罰球、均未中的、李紹唐王玉增後方接濟、牟作雲竄人籃下、投入一球、首開紀錄、</p>
<p>一度佔先</p>
<p>我乘戰勝威風、牟作雲再探敵壘、並兩次罰球、仍無建樹、時機一過、敵騎侵入、我五人嚴防、未幾、王南珍犯規、彼方罰中兩球、成二比二、旋王鴻斌又犯規、又被敵罰中二球、王鴻斌王南珍兩度奮力投籃、均無所獲、雙方競爭頗烈、李紹唐犯規、我又被罰中一球、日以五比二領先、王玉增改變作風、施展遠射、又未能得手、王鴻斌拚力搶球、連跌倒數决、牟作雲犀利無比、又得一球、成四比五、李紹唐王南珍建功心切、數投未中、王鴻斌投入一球、我以六比五佔先、</p>
<p>屢罰不中</p>
<p>此後日方罰球均中、反以九比六、十一比六佔先、我傳攻多决、均苦無機投籃、且命運不濟、王玉增遠射、球入籃而復出、遇有罰球機會、恒交臂失之、敵乘勝迭在篮下偷襲、連獲兩球、王鴻斌偶得良機、飛騰而入、又牟作雲托入一球、王玉增錦上添花、又單手擲入一球、成十此十五，上半時吿終、我負五分、統計共罰球十五次、均未中的、</p>
<p>紹唐罰出</p>
<p>易地後、雙方均以原綫應戰，其時雨勢漸大、我首得罰球機會未中、而我方犯規、敵每投必入、牟王兩鋒、展其純熟合作妙技、由王鴻斌投入、成十二比十六、時李紹唐四次犯規罰出、由王士選入代、互爭甚烈、敵守衛甚佳、我連續環攻、但投罰均不能中、日請停戰、換入一後衛、共勢仍熾、我牟作雲出塲、由沈聿恭代之、戰情仍無起色、未幾、彼隊長中鋒四次犯規罰出、王玉增罰中一球、開我隊罰中紀錄、</p>
<p>陳綫凌亂</p>
<p>我雖奪力進攻、但計無得逞、陳綫漸呈凌亂、日奪得球後、或短傳不進、以延時間、或遇有機會、卽乘隙而入、其右鋒短小活潑，得功最多、我方以十五比二十二、十五比二十六、十五比二十八、迭遭敗衂、沈聿恭雖稍有造就、但終無補大局、敵人動作更形活潑、尤以罰球最準、結果我以十九對三十五敗績、比賽採雙循環料、我尙有一次機會、願隊員努力、（八日晨三時由交部電臺轉播）</p>

<p>中央社特派員柏林無綫電報吿、我國足球以二比〇敗於英國、遂遭淘汰、甚為可惜、其失敗原因、非技術落後、乃實力不足、比賽時、觀衆有萬餘人、我國政府代表考試院長戴季陶、程大使、曁留德學生多人、均前往參觀、我留學生並組織啦啦隊助威、我隊表演至佳、守門包家平、後衛譚江柏李天生、嚴守後方、厥功甚偉、中衛綫陳鎭和徐亞輝、前後呼應、或攻或守、頗稱勇敢、前鋒由李惠堂任中鋒、英人素悉李為我足球隊主將、加以嚴密之監視、故無法展其所長、因之全隊　少生氣、右內鋒馮景祥踢來甚為靈活、左內鋒孫錦順脚頭頗稱老道、右翼曹桂成左翼葉北華較差、綜觀全局、我國進攻時、多採用短傳、致進兵遞緩、敵人易於佈防、且奔跑略慢、踢出之球、勁道不足、此為失敗之主因、終因技差一着、無可奈何、吾隊已盡力而為之矣、</p>

<p>彼隊之優點、在奔跑與動作均迅速敏捷、出球峻急　力、上半時雙方辛苦奮鬥、我後衛死守後方、使敵人無法得逞、四十五分鐘苦戰、以零比零、成和局、下半時彼乘隙猛攻、藉其實力與長力之充裕、直人我腹地、後衛返救不及、遂失一球、二十分鐘時又為敵銜入、包家平臥救不及、失第二球、我隊曾數度搗入敵綫、或因出脚遲緩、或因出球欠念、終無所獲、聞英皇曾致電該國選手、囑保持英國光榮、故比賽時、該隊十分賣力、</p>
<p>參加足球賽者、共十六隊、得决賽權者已有八國、共結果為英勝中二比〇、德勝盧森堡九比〇、意勝美一比〇、挪威勝土耳其四比〇、日勝瑞典三比二、奧勝埃及三比一、波蘭勝匈牙利三比〇、秘魯勝芬蘭七比三、</p>

<p>赴開羅途中</p>
<p>由馬蘇阿到博賽、共九百六十海里、中間要經過蘇彜士運河、蘇彜士運河北起博賽港、南至蘇彜士埠、共長八十七哩（一說一百零四哩）、是溝通地中海與紅海的人造的運河、換句話說、就是溝通歐亞航程的要道、郵船到蘇彜士埠、為一小時的停留、旅客可坐在原船上不動、航過這世界七大工程之一的大運河、而欣賞沿途的景色、或是由蘇彜士埠登岸、乘汽車去遊西方文明發源地之埃及的首都開羅Cairo、再由開羅乘車到博賽趕上原船、魚與熊掌、各聽其欲、</p>
<p>抵蘇彜士的前一天、船上發起組織團體、去遊開羅、一共有兩個組織、一個是通濟隆旅行社發起的、一個就是中國旅行社發起的、後者遊資頭等為六磅、一等五磅、前者則各貴半磅、記者來自東方文明始祖的古國、對西方文明發源地的埃及、仰慕已久、尤其時自幼讀地理時、憧憬在腦海裏的金字Pyramid與獅身人像Sphinx、印象很深、覺得在去瞻仰的必要、所以報名參加中國旅行社的組織、同行共四十人、選手團方面參加者祗體育考察團黃麗明陳詠聲杜雨飛三女士、與時事新報毛以信君及記者五人、其餘都是赴歐觀光團的團員、通濟隆旅行社的組織、參加者亦有三十人、均為歐洲與印度人、</p>
<p>十六日午夜、郵船駛抵蘇彜士、停泊運河口外、遠望運河中停泊了許多輪隻、燈炬輝煌、照耀着清澈的河水、一陣陣淸風送來、異常凉爽、大家於脫離紅海的熱流之後、睹此景色、極為興奮、檢查護照後、於十七日晨一時半離輪、乘汽艇登陸、旅行社向前在埃及邀請了一位專集、嚮導的人領導、二時半由蘇彜士分乘汽車八輛出發、有的是六人一車、有的是四人一車、頗稱舒適、</p>
<p>由蘇彜士到開羅、共一百五十英里、有公路可通、這條公路完全建造在沙漠中、工程極為艱困、前半段尚未修竣、崎嶇不平、後半段已舖了柏油、與大都市裏的馬路一樣平坦、深夜的沙漠氣候、多少帶着寒意、我們披星戴月、浩浩蕩蕩的疾馳前進、但見遍地黃沙、荒凉滿目、所幸旅伴衆多、尚無寂寞之苦、</p>
<p>記者同車的五位、都是觀光團團員、一位坐在汽車夫的旁邊、記者與另一位坐在車廂中的前排、其餘三位坐在後排、比較起來當然以坐在後排的最為舒適、車子走了半途的時候、停了休息、坐在前排的這位先生、於繼續前進時、不聲不響的坐到後排去、於是同原來坐在那裏的一位、大起爭執、一個說你應該遵守秩序、保持原位、一個說大家一樣化錢、應該輪換坐坐、雙方聲勢汹汹、大有動武之勢、結果還是由汽車夫的調解、才各守原位、可是車子再進、不到五分鐘、就拋了錨、大家沒有辦法、祗好擠到別的車子裏去、這兩位講求舒適的先生、也　有一聲不響的受着同樣的委曲、這幕趣劇、雖然是一件極小的糾紛、但是把中國人爭權奪利、非到兩敗俱傷不肯休止的劣根性、充分的表現出來、這種劣根性、可以說就是中國政治不能上軌道、社會永遠無秩序的根本原因、如果不能剷除、國家社會一定是永遠沒有辦法的、記者浪費筆墨來寫這段文字、讀者或不致過瑣碎見責吧、</p>
<p>閑話休講、言歸正傳、十七日的淸晨五點鐘、我們陸陸續續的到了這西方文化發源地的埃及首都開羅了、因為預定的遊覽時間祗有五小時、所以在近郊聚齊後、就穿過開羅、首先去瞻仰金字塔與獅身人像、</p>
<p>開羅與金字塔</p>
<p>開羅在外表上看來、並不像我們理想中古色古香的古都、而是一個完全現代化的大都市、全市都是五六層高大的洋樓、所有建築物的外層、都敷上黃色、與沙漠的色調極為調和勻稱、街道很寬闊平坦、但不甚淸潔、蒼蠅多極、到處飛舞、使人不勝其擾、如果我們一要在開羅的表面找出一點古氣的話、大概祗有女人的面幕了、女人的衣服均為黑色、面幕也是黑紗所製、垂到胸前、僅露兩眼、這回敎特有的習俗、保持現在還沒有革除、然而少數摩登女子、也已拋頭露面、並不以不帶面幕為可恥了、</p>
<p>金字塔建築在沙丘上、離開羅市約　哩、我們於裏曦中、穿繞着開羅市、跨　貫在尼羅河上的大橋、沒有多久、就到了金字塔的底下、天空上浮現着彩的浮雲、反映在沙漠上、現出黃金的顏色、金字塔所給我們的第一印象是十分美麗可愛的、</p>
<p>由沙丘的底下到金字塔、建築了一條柏油的道路、汽車可以直達、但是旅行到沙漠、是應該嘗試駱駝的風味的、所以全體都下車換騎駱駝、跪下地下的駱駝、當人騎上去的時候、先把前腿立起半節、然後把後腿立起、最後再把前腿立直、這樣一前一後進行着的三部曲、使騎在上面的人、也隨着一仰一伏、異常驚慌、幾位女的旅伴、駭得怪呌起來、</p>
<p>所謂金字塔、就是埃及古代帝王的墳墓、埃及全境、共有七十五個、在開羅的共是九個、其中六個較小、其餘三個即工程十分偉大、被稱為世界七大工程之一、最大的一個呌卓潑斯Cheaps、第二個呌雪弗林Cheiren、第三個呌門哈拉　Menkhara、都是帝王的名字、</p>
<p>卓潑斯建造於紀念前二千六百十九年、到現在已是四千五百五十多年了、雪弗林相差約五十年、門哈拉又差五十年、據說埃及古代的帝王、生前就奴役他的臣民、替他建造墳墓、費幾十年的時間、把工程趕完、他也就壽終正寢、鑽進了墳墓、而下一代的帝王接位、又開始建造、這樣連綿不絕的下去、古代埃及的人民、也就祗好永遠在為他們的帝王、建造墳墓、勞民傷財、祗為一人身後的墳墓打算、古代埃及帝王之專橫無道、由此可以想見了、</p>
<p>卓潑斯是全埃及最大的一座金字塔、建築時間、共達三十年之久、其中十年從事採石、因為開羅是不產石頭的、須從很遠的山上採了運來、其餘二十年則從事建造、所用人工、共達四百萬人之多、塔高四百五十一英尺、底脚為四方形、每邊亦為四百五十一英尺、所用的石頭、每塊都有二三噸重、一層小一層、堆砌上去、成一尖頂、共四角正對着東南西北四方、到現在已歷四千五百多年、仍舊絲毫沒有變動、有很多近代建築工程師去看了以後、都驚奇着不知古代的建築家、用什麽方法去開採這許多整齊的石頭、用什麽方法把牠運到開羅、用什麽方法把一塊一塊的搬上去、更不知他們用什麽方法把這座建築在沙漠上的偉大的建築物、能保持四五千年而絲毫不動搖改變、據我們嚮導說、這座金字塔共用石二百餘萬塊、計七百萬立方呎、如果用這許多匡石來建造二碼高城墻、可把全法國包圍起來、工程之大於此可見了、</p>
<p>大家因為時間忽促、衹在外面看了一看、就去看獅身人像、記者以到了這個偉大的古蹟前面、而不進去一探究竞、將引為終身憾事、所以在歸途時、一個人下了駱駝、飛步走了前去、在塔的東北面開了一個一人高的門、有兩三個土人守在那裏、走進去是曲曲折折的甬道、裏面裝了電燈、照耀得很淸楚、這條甬道有三四十步長、在到盡頭又是灣灣曲曲的石級、據守門的說、王帝的金棺藏在塔的上面、走上去要十分鐘、因為時間忽促、祗好失望的退了下來、記者雖然以未能一瞻金棺為憾事、可是大家看了塔裏面構造的復雜、益覺其工程的艱難與匠心之精巧了、</p>
<p>獅身人像、正對着雪弗林金字塔、而在沙丘的下面、據說這個怪物已有六千年的歷史了、但是考古家論為是與雪弗林金字塔同時建造的、因為這個「怪物」的像貌與藏在博物院裏的雪弗林的石像、是很相似的、據說建這怪物的用意、是在增加王墓的莊嚴、與我們古代帝王墳墓前的石象石馬、具有同一的意義、人面是象徵和平、獅身則象徵威武、表示古代帝王的性格與權威、這個獅身人像計六十英呎高、二百十英呎長、也用許多幾噸重的岩石堆砌了雕琢而成的、站在牠的正面看去、完全是一個人像、頭頂的兩邊、按下三角形的頭髮、眼睛雕刻得很深陷、神彩奕奕、因為經幾千年的日晒風吹、鼻子已塌陷了下去、把牠顯得十分醜惡、身體下面伸出兩隻巨腿、形迹也不十分淸晰、站在牠的旁邊去看、則完全是一個巨獅的形狀、古代埃及的藝術、是値得人欽佩的、</p>
<p>在獅身人像的右旁、還有一個古廟、據說也是雪弗林王建築的、因為時間忽促、不及入內一觀、全隊旅行者騎在駱駝上攝影留紀念後、就下去到附近的一個大旅館進用早餐、餐畢又驅車去參觀一個古代的王宮和博物院、</p>

<p>（姚允平先生問、周笑涵醫師答。）</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>鄙人現在的遺精病越發越厲害了。有時天天遺——一連繼續十幾天；並且遺時尚在睡鄕，醒時早已完了；向來無夢自遺。白天頭目暈眩，看書寫字等用腦用目的事差不多完全不能工作了。並且時覺寒慄，非常容易感冒，我服過不少的中西藥了，總不見效，在「新醫專刋」內看見「希米脫氏固精片」和「生殖素」專治這病；很有功效，上個月已向永安公司各購服了一匣試服，感覺遺精次數减少得多了，同時頭目暈眩的程度也覺到和緩得多。現在更有幾個問題要冒昧向你領敎，希望你犧牲些時光和精神，即日賜敎。費神，感謝，盼望…………都是我向你要說的。問題如下：</p>
<p>（1）「希望米脫氏固精片」和「生殖素」能否根本解决遺精病？換句話說是否服了此藥，會永不復發？</p>
<p>（答）「希米脫氏固精片」與固精名劑，而「生殖素」為聯合睪丸腎上腺腦下垂體甲狀腺等內分泌要素製劑。故為根本解决遺精的特效藥。</p>
<p>（2）余已服了一匣，已見效騐，不知再服幾匣，方可根治</p>
<p>（答）約五六匣。</p>
<p>（3）有婦人同居，能否治癒遺精？能否把病加重？</p>
<p>（答）最好不同衾，宜節制情慾，須完全根治後，方可行房事。</p>

<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>神經系統，遍佈全身，知覺之感觸，動作之運使，皆受命於神經，是故神經與吾人之關係，至重且巨，然神經之健全與否，視乎其營養之良否，而神經營養之來源，有賴於生殖素腺——內分泌，如生殖腺素缺乏，則神經失去營養，形成衰弱，而各種衰弱症狀蜂起，未老先衰特其最著者耳，患者腰痠背痛，面蒼神衰，失去壯健，早呈衰狀，治法以「生殖素」為最奏特效，如最近有患者倪君，訴有未老先衰，怕勞畏煩等症，自向中英藥房購服「生殖素」後，神經立轉繁榮，回復當年少壯，腰背有力，虎虎有生氣云。</p>

<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時（星期日休息）</p>
<p>性病之猖獗，隨都市之文明而進展，換言之，即都市愈文明，則性病愈猖獗也，按性病有傳染性與非傳染性之分，傳染性者如梅毒，白濁，橫痃，下疳等是也，非傳染性者如遺精，早洩，陰痿，性織等是也，變症旣不同，治法亦有異，凡吾患者，或延醫不便，或購藥無從，儘可來函問病，或參照本講座所述之療法，自行依法秘密自療，亦無不可。</p>
<p>白濁根治</p>
<p>本症病源，係由染入淋菌而起，淋菌凶惡，蟠踞於生殖器及泌尿器之粘膜後，據為護符，肆其荼毒，普通劣藥，未明透膜殺菌之重要，並未明其原理，故有妄稱可不必透膜者，為識者所竊笑，一經誤服，非但無效，且誤病機，迨病毒流竄全身，險症百出，治療更大費週章矣，特效治法，當透膜殺菌與增加抗淋力並重，市上欲求其兼具此二項效力之藥，直如鳳毛麟角，有之，惟德國醫學博士Jadassohn氏所發明之「安敵淋」Antirrhea為最效，對於急慢淋濁，倂發險症，婦女白帶子宮炎等症，均克收非常之效果，例如：前月有患者徐君，染濁年許，治未斷根，一再復發，困頓難堪，自向永安公司購服「安敵淋」後，淋止濁斷，尿澄炎消，連服三旬，所患霍然若失，迄未再發云。</p>
<p>白帶乳癟</p>
<p>生殖腺在人體之重要，本刋已詳論之，如生殖腺萎頹，或生殖腺素缺乏，則在男子現腎萎早洩等症，在女子旣月經不調，白帶，乳萎等症，且與健康，美麗，靑春，壽命等，均有莫大之關係。其治法自以內服「生殖素」為主，姿態夙美，因由呂君染來惡疾，致罹白帶腹痛，乳癟身弱等症，自內服「安敵淋」及外用「療帶靈」後，惡症白帶，同時吿治，惟身體及乳房一時無從復原，即投服「女用生殖素」，期未兩月，身體迅復壯健，乳蜂重行發育云。</p>
<p>遺精得救</p>
<p>手淫為靑年所難免之惡癖，已成公開的秘密，故遺精一症，亦成靑年之通病矣，患者面黃肌瘦，血枯神衰，失眠健忘，衰病蜂起，救治之法，首當固其精關，次當補其生殖腺，始可根治，例如：夏初有患者汪君，苦於遺精次數頻添，疲憊難支，自向五洲藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精，服「生殖素」以補已損壞之生殖後，精關旣固，遺精亦瘳，現在精足神旺，血濃肌壯，重獲發育，再返壯健，宛若再造云。</p>

<p>白濁骨痛</p>
<p>患者張君：染濁二年，治非一次，愈後復發，難於治根，冬末更感骨痛，醫治無效，痛苦愈增，自向永安公司西藥部購服「安敵淋」以治慢性淋濁，並服「強斯登氏骨痛片」以治淋濁性骨痛後，痛楚旣消，淋濁亦治，迄今半年，從未再發云。</p>

<h3 id="c227">發育與健康及壽命的關係 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>……人類必須經過美滿的發育——　能不夭逝　……發育不全會影響性的快感——須速籌補救　……應培植生殖腺的強固壯健——以延長壽命</p>
<p>發育的範圍頗廣，特別重要者為性器官。蓋性器短小，為發育不全的一種重要症象。其原因可分先天性與天性兩種。所謂先天性者，因性器畸形，或在發育時期各種內分泌腺（例如松果腺，腦下垂體，甲狀腺，胸腺，副腎，生殖腺等是。）疾病異常而至性器發育受阻。</p>
<p>後天性者，主要因睪丸生殖腺發生障碍，又有濫用性器漫無節制，尤其在幼年時之自凟行為，最能妨害發育，使性器短小，又包莖亦有抵制發育的傾向，可就專門醫師用手術割除之。（編者按：割除包皮可就性病專家詹念曾醫師處為之，担保絕無痛苦，手術老練，經騐豐富。）</p>
<p>其他發育之關於女子者，如月經雖至成熟之年齡，尚未來潮，缺少曲腺美，乳房硬固而小，陰毛不多，發育微弱如童稚。</p>
<p>除此之外，尚有身體的發育不全，體格矮小，精力不足，骨絡細軟，形成多病煩惱之象。此種人若再不講求發育的方法，或任其自然演變，或竟悍然不顧，實行結婚，非但有短促生命的危險，勢必引起性生活的痛苦，女子雖出嫁，亦無受孕能力。男子必致陽勢衰弱，陰莖萎縮，而一切神經衰弱症勢必相繼爆發，如耳鳴，頭痛，心悸，健忘，失眠等。試想此種人的生命，會不會像無舵之舟，朝不夕保了？</p>
<p>很危險的事，現在有了補救了，醫藥的萬能，確屬是無可否認，人們如有發現上述的不幸，可以內服生殖腺製劑的「生殖系」，能使睪丸及性器增大，陰先增加，身體及全身骨骼一般地能生筋肉性強壯的狀態。同時直接有摧促生殖腺機能的能力，使之內分泌腺之作用亢盛，那末性器官及全身或局部自會發育長大，女子可服女用特製的「生殖素」能使乳房擴大，由線畢露，月經調整，生育絕無問題，身體強壯的結果，這樣，男女們方可以享最高的年齡了。</p>

<p>紗市趨疲跌風復熾良以新花不久當可上市、多數人心觀跌、且本月紗價雖比現貨為棄、然多方鑒於環境不良、忍痛斬結者頗不乏人、氣勢愈見怠懈、市盤乃步步下降矣、</p>
<p>本月逼近二百元關</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美棉三品紗俱見上昇、近月續漲五·六·七·八角、但拍至遠期轉趨下疲、回跌二·三角、二盤以後、鑒於原棉下跌、達記·泰昌·豐泰·仁豐·協成又來猛烈拋賣、一時市塲情形急變、賣勢奇濃、近跌一元六·八角、遠跌一元二·三角、迨至三收盤仍無回好能力、且現紗交易减縮、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元二·三·四·七·八角、查賣出大孚一千包、通記六百包、恒益七百包、聚興八百包、永裕六百包、豐泰一千包、仁豐一千四百包、元一八百包、泰昌二千一百五十包、長豐八百包、協成一千包、永昶八百包、買進德大一千一百包、裕康一千三百包、大豐六百包、錦昌一千九百包、明德　千七百五十包、泰興七白包、大昌成八百包、同和一千二百五十包、晉康六百五十包、半日間最高低市盤列左、</p>

<p>棉市陳花在落不已、實緣天氣轉晴、新花登塲時期日近、廠方對於陳花絕無購辦之意、因此人心允挫、遠期因新花拋盤售價甚廉、買進者皆畏縮不前、壓力甚重、惟美棉狀况、尙覺安定耳、</p>
<p>近期陳花回跌九角牛</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉雖漲五至十一磅音、印棉漲跌〇·二五至〇·五羅比、大阪三品花漲五六角、然市塲人心極其衰弱不振、且賣勢劇烈、本月陳花跌三角半、新花跌一·二角、二盤陳花跌力更兇、遠期因天時晴正、棉花前途可樂觀、賣者紛至沓來、市盤愈形不支、標花結果八月比上日收盤價猛跌九角半、遠期跌三角半至四角、查賣出恒益千二百担、達記一千九百担、明德　千八百担、振大一千担、合興二千八百担、賡豐一千一百担、益昶二千五百担、潤康二千九百担、恒昌二千三百担、生源一千七百担、買進聚興一千八百担、大豐一千担、源大一千四百担、錦昌一千四百担、長餘三千一百祖、愼昌二千八百担、愼記二千四百担、元一四千一百担、大昌成二千扭、永昌一千九百担、源興昌一千三百担、半日間市價列左、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、外商買進、各月漲二至四磅音、旋以奧克拉霍馬有輕雨、穀市無力而疲、午後廠家限價買進、同時謠傳合作社將收成估計减至一二、六〇〇、〇〇〇包、空戶抵補、又見回好、衆意目前市價、可在政府報吿一二、二五〇、〇〇〇包左右、無所變動、收盤平穩、計現貨漲六磅音、期貨　六至十一磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨跌一二點、印棉初因略有買進而堅、旋以美棉政府報吿將發表、多頭了結而疲、惟售額均為出口商所吸收、計平果爾漲半羅比、奧姆辣跌〇·二五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·五至〇·七五羅比、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份漲落靡常、形勢混亂、因洋麥報價、芝加哥近好八分、遠跌二四角、坎拿大跌八分至二角、開價時以實銷未暢、故本月及九月份曾跌一分左右、惟至十月及十月份因前日尙未漲足、空頭狂補、南洋又微有生意、故較前日收價、又激提二三分、拍至一月份因廠家略拋、人心回軟、迨至二盤、因客帮及業外停手、而天津帮反有回出、致市面逐步回跌、勢頗猛烈、收盤結局、十月至十二月份、各回落二三分、一月份因差度太遠、始終銳跌、一無回顧、較之前日最高開價、已跌七分之巨、查目下尙在新麥時期、到此高昂局面、已覺可觀、此後如果洋麥轉風、多頭亦難免危險云、</p>

<p>昨日客秈續有到源、新貨早米亦接續抵埠、允以江西米來貨為多、而去路雖活、成交數終未見增、且四川胃口已呆、寗波北帮等亦乏續胃、市面因此不易轉機、惟昨日本街內地去化均濃、廣州新有採辦、市面尙可站定、全日開出江西米三千包、湖南米四百五十包、其他各米均乏成交、惟據業中消息、近日湖南來電、該地出數不多、產價步昂、故今後湘米來源或將减少云、</p>

<h3 id="c251">走那一條路？ <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 陳膽星</p>
<p>上一學期的結束，許多女同學已受完了基本敎育，這邊跨出中學堂的門，那邊又得預備進大學以求深造的，就難免有徬徨岐路之苦。最大的問題，是怎樣選習專門學科，横在面前的有敎育，昔樂，美術，醫藥，蠶桑，文學，再加上法律，理化，體育，交通，土木工程，甚至於軍事與航空，在這非常時期的環境中，女子同樣有研究學習的可能性。但是，種種學科的陳列，已使女同學們眼花撩亂，心旌搖搖，究竟選擇那一科呢？究竟那一科配我學習的呢？那一條路是通達到自己目的地的？不得不慎重考慮。</p>
<p>解决這一個問題的時期，對於女同學們的未來生活，實含有至大的關鍵，有許多性好音樂的同學，却去從事學習土木工，有許多愛好文學的同學，反去盲從地研究理化，於是伊們時時感到一種違反個性的苦痛，卽使埋頭用心，亦有格格不入之勢，事半功倍，有些中途改弦易轍，精神，時間，經濟的損失，自在不言中。一個人求學除開志願和目標的認識外，更須顧到是否能適合自己的個性。假使已經有了未婚夫的，那麼為着將來在社會求生活的合作起見，在可能範圍內，得選擇與對方相同的，或有着相關性的學科，免得日後志趣相背，非但不獲夫婦互助，反而發生不良的現象，這一點却又不能固執</p>
<p>適合環境的需求，亦是女同學們選科的一個準則，在農村裏的女學生，為欲挽救農村經濟的衰落，就得立志研究蠶桑農業，卽或於興趣稍差，亦只好犧牲一己，拯救大衆，這是一例，其他如軍事，航空？醫藥急救在這非常時期的中國，尤其需要這類人才的服役。嚴格地說，求學不但為自身，為家庭，抑且為社會大衆，為國家民族，卽使音樂，藝術，亦並不例外。</p>
<p>受完基本敎育的女同學們，各種專科在你面前，你們走那一條路？這問題須你們自决，要適合個性，又要適合環境。盲從和嘗試是不對的！</p>
<h3 id="c252">女子職業與職業女子 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 王端</p>
<p>在這沒有完全擺脫舊思想的中國，做女子的祇有老守在家裏的份兒。一方面，做父母的對於女兒，做公婆的對於兒媳，都抱着十八世紀「在家靠父母，出嫁靠丈夫」的念頭，不讓婦女們跑向社會去謀生。他們以為一個女子好好地不在家裏享福却到外面去做什麽事，這是一件多麼「不體面」的舉動。在另一方面，做女子的也正有不少在學校讀完書以後，祇知享樂和專賴人家，就此拋棄了有為的一生，去過着金絲籠鳥的生活了。雖然也有的是不受虛榮的引誘，懷着堅毅不屈的大無畏精神，和環境去奮鬥終於得到勝利，而向職業途上去走的。</p>
<p>女子職業不普及的中國，女子的出路又在那裏呢？幾個商店，機關偶而用上幾個女職員，表面上他們高唱着「提倡女子職業」，實際上却都懷着不良的心；有為了招徠顧客才用女職員的；有為了調劑枯燥的寫字間生活才僱來當做玩賞用的；甚至有借了「職業」的幌子，來實行他們欺侮玩弄目的都有。他們以為女子祇是供人玩弄，供人觀賞的東西，於是那侮蔑的綽號－「花瓶」兩個字，就很快地加上了職業女子的頭上。</p>
<p>難道女子個個都沒有用處嗎？難道祇配給男子們當玩物的嗎？當然我們絕對不能承認的。但這話從何而來，我們又不得不加以檢點：試看好多的女子，到社會來做事祇是抱「出風頭」主義而已，這便是主因來了。有的更受了虛榮的引誘，不惜放棄了實際的生活拚命地去追求，終至遭了惡毒陷阱的吸引而至於墮落；還有的是自命風流，打扮得妖形怪狀在經理先生面前獻媚的，把辦公室當作了交際塲；更有些的一天到晚不做事，專和男職員們鬼混着，打情駡俏，無所不幹的。這些固然是少數中的少數，然而正當女子職業發軔的時候，這至少有很大的不利於別個女子。這些不知恥的敗類，終於連累了別人給人輕視鄙薄；女子職業，無形中更加不被人重視而愈趨低落了。</p>
<p>借了提倡女子職業做工具，來實行其玩弄女性的目的，這是多可鄙賤的事情。高唱「女子該向社會去」的人們，你們該用誠實的態度來替女子們闢一條出路才對。同時，服務社會的職業女子們，你們難道忍受得住這種侮蔑的稱呼嗎？你們難道自甘不長進嗎？不，决不，趕快强健你們的意志，趨避虛榮的引誘，尊重你們的人格，致力實際的工作，替社會出力，為自己造福，前程無限的女子職業的大路，正等待着你們去開發前進呢！</p>

<p>— 斅良</p>
<p>當我在××中學畢業的時候，我懷着很大的雄心，對於吾國千百年來被傳統思想所束縛的婦女，極想做一些解放的工作，使大家從家庭中跑出來，服務於社會，為我們婦女們爭取平等自由的地位。</p>
<p>很幸運地，就在那年秋天，找到了一個銀行裏的小職位，常我前去任職那一天，眞快活得了不得，以為從此可以解脫束縛，對於婦女界可以効一點力了。</p>
<p>但是說也可憐，我做了幾個月的工作，除了同事張女士對我的意見能表同情外，其他的女同事，都認為我的思想奇突，不管我用種種方法去連絡她們也無辦法，她們都中了時下的摩登毒，平日祗願看電影，談戀愛，講究衣飾，同她們談到婦女本身的解放，她們也會表示頭痛，討厭。就是看書也僅僅喜歡戀愛一類的小說。這樣，把我在學校裏時的雄心，就此减弱了許多。原來中國的婦女是這樣的不長進的！</p>
<p>這樣的做了的莫一年時光，我便跌入了愛河中去，終於在那年冬天結了婚。我的丈夫是在電報局做事的，他的薪水是六十元，加了我的三十元，每月的生活過的很安好。可是在第二年我就生了一個孩子，不能做事了，於是全部的收入僅有六十元，要維持我們兩人及一個小孩，一個娘姨，事實終於無法分配，所以經過幾個月，祗好再去做事。但是小孩子用奶媽太費錢，便决定日間讓他吃奶粉，晚上由自己給他吃奶，可是這是空想，孩子日問不吃奶，自已的奶漲痛得難受，為了做事，祇好讓孩子完全吃奶粉。自然，我們的開支更大了，而且在我們兩人出外做事的時候，衣服由洗衣作洗，吃飯大都在外面，祇有星期日由我自己煮，而今却要天天預備伙食了，由娘姨主持着家務，非但不知節省，每月所費的錢往往超出了我的預算，而且所做的事情，又都不能使我滿意。因此，我祇好放棄職業，回到家裏。</p>
<p>現在我已把娘姨辭退，一切的家庭雜務，如洗衣，燒飯，領孩子等等，都由自己去做着。</p>
<p>依據上面的事實，我感覺得中國婦女要得到眞正的解放：第一，時下的摩登毒果然應該肅淸；第二還應聯合同情於我們的男子，共同的把社會制度澈底改造，使婦女在社會上與男子有同樣的地位，不為家務所纍，才能眞正談得到解放！</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>海上自由職業界從數最多的，首推律師，總數有一千二百餘人，我們新聞記者不到他們的半數；醫師也不及他們多；會計師更是瞠乎共後了。律師界自然男的多，女的少，這些女律師，各有各的地位，也各有其長處，今天我所欲介紹的，是女律師中出類拔萃的一人－錢劍秋博士。這並不是隨便敷衍她一聲，實因她的思想，學識，人格，在在足為女界的表率，像這樣的人，當然會受大家尊敬的。博士現任律師公會委員，上海法學院敎授，不但擅長法學，於文學，書法，也很有根底。對於戲劇史上，也佔過光榮的一頁。讀者記得十二年前轟動一時的「少奶奶的扇子」麽？那齣話劇，在上海是破犬荒的，她在劇中飾金女士，曾一口氣說上一千數百字的說白，使觀衆灑了不知多少涕淚，在這本戲裏，顯出她的天才，甚至驚動了全社會，這眞是個奇蹟。</p>
<p>導演家洪深，當時勸她硏究戲劇，但她志不在小，認為戲劇到底不是最大的願望。一九二九年赴美，入芝加哥西北大學，專攻法學，榮膺博士學位，回國後便執行律務，三年前和黃比　君結婚。這位黃博士，就是她留美時同校，同級，同學位，而且同道回國的良伴，這段姻緣，你想是何等的美滿！可是婚後他宦遊首都，她服務海上，遙遙相隔，各盡共職，雖說兒女情長，他們倒也處之泰然，這又是個奇蹟。</p>
<h3 id="c256">右圖中立者爲錢博士 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>前天我去訪問她，談了一小時，第一個問題；「女士對新家庭的見解？」</p>
<p>她說：「中國新女性的責任，比男子重得多，男子是單純的對外工作，女子不僅要發展她個人的新事業，而且連帶負着新家庭的責任，內外兼顧，豈不是較男子為重麽？話是這麽說，究竟現在的女性，還不曾到「新」的階叚呢。過去大家庭制度，誰都知道勞逸不均，苦樂不同；生依賴之心；長推諉之念；流弊百出，顯然不及小家庭制的完善。可是新家庭也不是百利而無一弊的，最易發現的缺憾，便是夫婦對等的態度。我以為夫婦間必須確立「敬愛」與「諒解」的態度，西洋人對此都很重視，我中國人似乎淡薄些。夫婦間能「敬愛」，則相扶相助，彷彿二位一體；能「諒解」，則如有誤會，亦可化大為小，化小為夫。不過家中遇重大事項，須取得雙方一致的意見，不能獨斷獨行，應平心靜氣的探討，不能因「諒解」而輕易放棄了芷直的已見。在這當兒，要重事實，少意氣，自可免除衝突的糾紛。新家庭不論貧富貴賤，一律以勤儉，刻苦，耐勞，為共通的原則。家政最好勿假手於人，如事實上需要婢僕，應善待而不該賤視，且須加以訓練，使識字知禮，他們來自鄉間，年長失學，如不施以敎練，常有設客，失責，粗暴等行為，於人於已，受累無窮。子女不能多產，兒女多了，敎養難以周全，重父母的責任，增一家的痛苦，家庭敎育，須十分注重，偉大的人格，是從小家庭裏養成的。終日辛勤的人，不能不有娛樂，但不正當的娛樂，不當存在於新家庭。我所主張的娛樂：（一）郊外游散，（二）體育方面的活動；（三）參加音樂會同樂會等；（四）志同道合的家庭間的連終；（五）看高尙的戲劇或影片，至於主婦的責任，治家政是最低的限度，進一步兼助丈夫的事業；能力優裕的應盡量發揮個人的心志，多做有利社會大衆的事業，務使內外兼顧，不偏不倚，而後可稱新時代的女性。</p>
<p>女子對外服務，不能以為我是女子，應享特殊的權利，而可以少做事，或只做輕便的事。這種心理，是降低婦女地位的劣等心理。吾人做事，全靠實際力量，如能力充分，確有眞才實學，自會受人敬重，並沒有男女界限的分別。</p>
<p>「現代女靑年的修養，應有何種標準？」</p>
<p>我提出了這個問題，她沉思一會，便發出如下的答話；「各人所處的境遇不同，修養的標準，多少總有些差別的。我以為每一個女靑年，應當特別注意：（一）德無所謂「新」「舊」，聖人說：「言忠信，行篤敬。」這是持躬處世的始基（二）養成獨立精神，袪除依賴的心理；（三）鍜鍊强他的體魄；（四）確立社會與國家的觀念；（五）有遠大眼光，勿拘小節；（六）尊重自己的人格。還有一點，凡是有機會讀書的女子，切勿輕便放棄了千載一時的機會，家境淸寒的人，無法升學，比較優裕的人，應當立志上進，勿埋滅了靑年的壯志，而抱定「我今日之所學，必將來為社會所用，」的志向。</p>
<p>就法律的觀點來說，近數十年來，各國女子要求法律平等的待遇，早已達到目的，一般國家的現行法律，大概已採用男女平等的原則，對剝奪女子的部分，已多數廢棄。不過在法律上權利與義務，是對等的條件，享了權利，不能不盡義務。法律旣賦予女子享同等的權利，實際能否與男子盡同一義務，這全是事實問題，法律不過倡導而已。」</p>
<p>「由於法律的平等，我就想到一個有趣的事來，如婦女的稱呼，習慣上女子嫁後名字上往往冠以夫姓，不知法律上有何根據？」</p>
<p>她說：「依現行法確有「妻以其本姓冠以夫姓」的規定，但並非强制，當事人可自由引用；在事實上妻姓冠以夫姓，極為通俗，甚至嫁後不用己名，只稱為×××夫人，如此稱呼，在歐美國家亦極通行。歐美女學生嫁後，往往不用原名，在交際應酬塲中，稱為Mrs——，在我看來，本姓冠以夫姓，殊非必要，卽使沿用本名，絕無不方便之處。」</p>
<p>她最後表示：「中國目前切要的問題，端在敎育，我常感到貧苦失學的有志靑年，及多數愚魯無知的人民，引起十分同情。我心中有個計劃，可惜現在還不能實行，一旦經濟力量充裕的話，便提出一筆獎　金來，救濟一般有思想有天才的靑年，使他們志有所歸，學有所成，可為社會國家創造偉大的事業。這種心願，還望社會有力的人，大家來提倡，眞是功德無量的。像美國有許多大富翁，把遺產捐給著名的大學，培植有為的靑年，這百年樹人的大計，難道我們中國人就辦不到麽？」</p>

<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>生離，死別，懷春，遲暮，失戀，遺棄，非耦，喪亂。「拜新月，拜月出堂前；暗魄深範桂；虛弓未引絃。……拜新月，拜月不勝情。月臨人自老，望月更長生。東家阿母亦拜月，一拜一悲聲斷絕。昔年拜月逞容儀，如今拜丹雙淚垂。回看衆女拜新月，却憶閨中年少時！」</p>
<p>元微之所賞識的浙東女詩人劉采春的囑嗊曲中，也有嗟悼遲暮的五絕一首：</p>
<p>「昨日勝今日，今年老去年。黃河淸有日，白髮黑無緣！」</p>
<p>失戀之怨</p>
<p>士為知己者死，女為悅己者容。顧影自憐，而不得所歡之寵，也是女子心理上所最不堪的。隋煬帝宮女侯夫人因不得進御，怨而自經，臂繫錦囊，中有詩：</p>
<p>「妝成多自惜，好夢却成悲。不及楊花意，春到來處飛。」</p>
<p>「欲泣不成淚，悲來翻强歌，庭花方爛漫，無計奈春何！」</p>
<p>武則天以曠代女英豪，嬖亂面首無數，而亦有失戀之吟，其如意曲云：</p>
<p>「看朱成碧思紛紛，憔悴支離為億君。</p>
<p>不信比來常下淚，開箱騐取石榴裙。」唐明皇初寵梅妃江采蘋，其後寵愛了楊太眞，遷梅妃於上陽宮。適夷使貢珍珠，明皇以一斛賜妃，妃報以詩云：</p>
<p>「桂葉雙眉久不描，殘妝和淚濕紅綃，長鬥盡日無梳洗，何必珍珠慰寂寥！」</p>
<p>遺棄之怨</p>
<p>鸞鳳和諧，白首偕老，這是人間最有幸福的伉儷。然而世間有無數痴男怨女，起初是海誓山盟，到頭來是鸞飄鳳泊。在重男輕女的封建社會中，被遺棄的女子方面，只得飲泣呑聲，沒有法律可以申訴。在舊禮敎牢籠之下，還要以保全名節自範。從下面幾首詩歌裏頭，可以想像到古時一般被遺棄的婦女的悲哀。</p>
<p>「鴛鴦在梁，戢其左翼。之子無良，二三其德！」（詩白華七章，周幽王得褒姒而黜申后，周人因作是詩。）</p>
<p>「新裂齊紈素，皎潔如霜雪，裁成合歡扇，團團似明月。出入君懷袖，動搖微風發。常恐秋節至，凉颷敚炎熱，棄捐篋笥中，恩情中道絕！」</p>
<p>（漢成帝時，班婕妤以趙飛燕姊妹之交譖，妤婕恐見危，乃供奉太后於長信宮·因作紈扇詩。）</p>
<p>「煢煢白兎，東走西顧。衣不如新，人不如故！」（漢寳元妻怨歌）</p>
<p>「誰言去婦　？去婦情更重。千里不唾井，况乃昔所奉！望遠未為傷，踟蹰不得共·」（魏劉動妻王宋以無子被出，因作此詩。）</p>
<p>「春華誰不美，卒傷秋落時。突煙還自低，鄙退豈所期！桂芳徒自　，失愛在蛾眉。坐見芳時歇，憔悴空自嗤！」（晋石崇婢翔風被遣棄後的怨詩。</p>
<p>非耦之怨</p>
<p>古代婚姻，因出於父母之命，媒妁之言，而非由本人自主；或雖自主而仍出於盲目，於是或以性情不諧，或以才貌不稱，遂有彩鳳隨鴉，　質墮溷之哀。而從一而終的吃人禮敎，又把她們枷鎖得無法解脫。啞子吃黃連，有苦說不得，其見於三百篇的如衛莊姜；見於宋代女詩人的有李淸照，朱淑眞，可為此中代表。</p>

<p>— 茵</p>
<p>文鳳，不用說，當然是一個絕頂摩登的上海小姐了；伊揀選婢女旣是那末的注意漂亮，伊自己怎麽會有不講究漂亮的道理呢？因為伊自已一漂亮，伊所來往的女同學，女朋友們自然也個都很漂亮的了；而且，伊還很秘密地　着一個漂亮的情侶咧！</p>
<p>湘琳在伊女主人的寵信之下，工作自然是非常的努力，閑是閑非，自然也少不得要搬上兩句，這倒可以別管；只是伊原來已是一個怪風流的人物，自從進了何家，天天跟文鳳以及伊的一班女友在一起混着，奢侈心和虛榮心更是一天增厚一天。再加湘琳待伊非常客氣，因此所有的人也全不敢把伊當做下人看待，伊眞是自由極了。初來時伊還穿的短衣，後來就改成長旗袍了，再後來，連高跟鞋也穿上了。燙髮塗脂，越發不用說了。伊的長相兒本在文鳳之上，如今再這麽大大的考究了打扮之後，簡直把文風完全壓倒了。外面不知道底細的人見了，誰也猜不透伊們是主僕。</p>
<p>「你看，何家的湘琳眞比文鳳自己更漂亮。……」</p>
<p>「湘琳道模樣兒，還不像個標準美人嗎？文鳳怎比得上……」</p>
<p>漸漸地，這一類的話在各人的嘴裏竊竊地談論着了，後來終於次到了文鳳的耳朶裏，這自然是很使伊不快的，伊無倫怎樣寵愛湘琳，但讓人家說伊自己比不上湘琳的美，那是隨便怎樣都不能忍受的。但當初是伊自己挑中的，現在怎麼又好把伊攆走呢？於是伊只得在暗中用一種消極的手段去對付伊，第一限制伊塗脂抹粉，只說是老太爺不歡喜；第二是限制伊穿高跟鞋，只說是老太太嫌走路的聲音太響。湘琳當然不能不服從，便改穿了一雙繡花緞鞋，不施脂粉，露出了伊原有的一副精俏的龐兒。啊呀！這樣是更美了！文鳳瞧着也還覺得太惹眼，便進一步，限制伊燙頭髮。這樣，湘琳根本就不去剪頭髮了，養了幾個月，便自己盤起了一個便髻來。那知人家看伊是更美了。何家上下的人都在很驚奇地贊嘆道「現在湘琳是更標緻了，眞像一個少奶奶一樣。」</p>
<p>少奶奶，當然是有少奶奶底那種美法的。文鳳子細留神觀察，湘琳近來的美，的確已有了一種少奶奶美的美法。同時又發現伊的繍花緞鞋，差不多隔五天，就要換一雙，買的束西也很多，彷彿經濟很寬裕的樣子；每逢星期六，星期日又往往要吿假出去，而且言詞之間，也不像先前的軟了，文鳳因此就起了絕大的疑心。後來忽又發現伊自己的情人對伊的態度漸漸地淡了，如其打電話來，逢到接電話的是湘琳，便往往要說上幾分鐘，文鳳質問他，他又否認。可是有一天，終於給伊在一家電影院內發見伊的情人正和湘琳在一起，並肩密語，活像是一對新婚的夫婦一樣，文鳳氣極了，待到散戲時，故意留在出口處候着；那知他們兩個人手挽手的儘走，只當不曾看見伊一樣。</p>
<p>文鳳回到家裏，臉也氣靑了，一陣摔把湘琳所有的東西全摔到門外去了，還想候伊回來痛痛快快的打罵一塲，不料候到天明，湘琳也沒有回來，從此伊就正式去和文鳳的情人實行同居之愛了。</p>

<p>— 我</p>
<p>我昨天飯後無事，拿了一張申報閒看，在外埠消息方面，看了李白提出和平條件，請中央給一名義出洋，而蔣委員長且再電李白，促其卽日離桂，迅就新職，閒之十分痛快，照這樣情形，桂軍的異動，大約有和平解决之可能，若果如此，殊令人讚嘆李白之深識大體也。</p>
<p>後又讀到，日人深入寗甘，在各旗組織特務機關，分在阿拉善旗平凉等地活動，又讀到津日領館擬就方案，擴充華北警權，又讀到日浪人在津設廠，私製毒品，又讀到津日租界日軍，演習巷戰，又讀到日海軍，擬具國防新計劃，圖覇太平洋，又讀到時評日本擅在成都設立總領事館問題，我不知不覺，便把手內的茶杯，砰的一聲，擲在天井裏頭，碎成一萬三千九百九十九塊。</p>
<p>這樣新聞，我不高興看了，翻轉來看看世界新聞，第一條，便是阿國人心不死，續與意軍猛烈抗戰，阿軍四萬，向台西推進，阿國人民有這樣硬幹的精神，殊為難得，第二條，便是不干涉西國內政，英德比表示贊同，惟德國須以蘇聯同樣接受為條件，而意大利尚無覆文，態度不明，第三條，便是意飛機眞相，法國調查竣事，證明隸屬意國正規空軍，第四條，德軍艦開到休達港，惟據德陸軍部聲稱，旨在護僑，若看各國這樣鈞心門角的情形，西班牙不為第二次大戰的導火綫者幾希，我不禁抽了十七八口冷氣。</p>
<p>讀國內新聞，這樣懊惱，讀讀國外新聞，又是那樣的動氣，我想看看本埠新聞，必定有趣一些，價錢讀吧！一，日水兵農村建設繼續調查證據，二，準蓮社老道高楝樑，父子互訴的可恥，三，匪刦祥生車，四，蘇州交際花訴遺棄判决，五，兩男女投江，劉正興被控，八，閘北兩男孩被拐在厦門，招家屬前往認領，九，徐德裕外甥，拐匿其幼女，十，無錫旅館一旅客服毒，呀！上海社會竟是如此情形，非奸卽盜，非拐卽騙，非烟卽殺，這是一個怎樣的社會呢？</p>
<p>本來我不大讀報，今天偶一讀報，而各處發現的印象若此，如讀已前之報，恐有更甚於今日之情形者甚多，已往之賬，可以不算，如以後再欲讀報，恐有江河日下之勢，亦宋可知，惟足差强人意者，祇有李白提出和平條件，請中央給予名義出洋一事耳，然果能實行與否，當待來日之證明，故我下次不願讀報。</p>

<p>— 林納</p>
<p>我們接到了洲府的電報，說摩洛番造反了。為着職務，我被報館派去担任採訪工作。</p>
<p>這兒是屬于摩洛省的一部份，發難的地方是在一個小小的市鎭里。這市鎭，只有一條短短的街道，密密地擠着百多間低矮的鋅屋子，在屋子里，就住着支那和日本商人。這些商人，是以極低微的洋貨去換取內地的椰子和五谷而存在的。</p>
<p>一輪破貨車把我裝着，像鐘擺似的在山坡上搖擺着。車夫是在地人，一個四十左右黝黑而短小的人，他很胆怯地吿訴我道：</p>
<p>「住慣了大城市的人，做夢也想不到這兒會發生了這樣事情。…」他低低的嘆息着，面孔有點蒼白。「他們不是人，而是野獸，你想一想：他們這麽地全身渾赤着，頭上綁了一條紅布條，三更半夜里像蜂湧似的掩進了鎭里；於是，全鎭便給吶喊聲充塞住了。人們混亂地嘶喊而且哭呌着，在黑暗中，什麽也辨別不出來，黑越越的儘是人，赤裸裸地在踴躍着的人，不時只見有幾縷刀光在閃耀着。…」他又搖起頭。深思了一會，才又喃着道：「這是奇跡，先生，沒有看見過已經三十多年了。…」</p>
<p>這兒有一所敎堂，可是已經給暴徒們用木材團團地圍困着，放火燒掉了，火光還沒有熄滅，曠塲上全是炭臭和瓦爍，有四五個人警察正在指揮着大批工人。着手挖掘工作，因為有幾個西班牙神父，給活生生的在這瓦爍里埋葬了。</p>
<p>「這是一個大不幸！」我去拜訪鎭分處的警察處長，他是一個高大的中年人，先用手擺了一擺，然後再用激動的聲調呌道：「但是，我們已盡了我們所能做到的責任了。這有上旁作見證，從開始一直到結尾，我就把全副精神，花在領導僅有的十二個警士和那一千多暴徒作戰的工作里。…而現在，事情已過去了，像一縷爛電似的過去了…」</p>
<p>他底面孔微微地抖動了一下，便嚴肅地笑着。</p>
<p>「我希望你能吿訴我，關于這回起事的原因。」我問着。</p>
<p>「這，」他深鎖住眉頭，想了一會，才又接着道：「這很淸楚，三條日本商店，聯合着向一羣摩洛番行騙法，先是商人這麽呌道，當那些士番從內地帶來了大秕的椰子的時候。</p>
<p>—我們很歡迎，老朋友！你能允許我出了特別的價錢把你底貨色留下嗎？</p>
<p>—可以的，我們很願意！摩洛番們用快活的聲調答着。</p>
<p>—那麽過磅吧！於是商人們，便拿出了那個能够便一百五十磅重的貨色，變成一百零五磅的磅碼來。對不住，先生我得說明一下，在這兒底支那和日本商人，都是靠這樣來過日子的，沒有這樣他們便過不下去，眞的過不下去。末了，這些商人們又送給了他幾件好玩兒的貨色，溫和地說：</p>
<p>—好朋友，椰子磅過了，過兩天，只要再過兩天，你們便可以來這兒要你所要的東西了…</p>
<p>摩洛們很滿意這樣的答覆，用手輕輕的把那些好玩兒拿着，撫摸了一頓，便納在懷里走了。可是過了幾天，他們下山來要他們所要的東西了，但是發現了那些鋅屋里是空的，商人搬走了，於是便沮喪着面孔回山去。這樣過了幾天，事情便發生了。…</p>
<p>在這時，有人忽忙地進來，我便辭着要走，他很快活地跟在我背後，送着走。</p>
<p>「對不住，我不能好好地招待你，上岷里拉如果要把這新聞登出，請替我加上幾句說：支羅鎭警察分處長瑪洛爾盡責守公，黑夜率警十二名，奮勇勘平暴徒三千…」</p>
<p>我說我很喜歡替他服務，拉着手，我們便分開了。</p>
<p>在街上，我慢慢地走着，那矮矮的，嚴整的鋅房子，已有好些給燒燬了，剩下的只有幾十家，門板給緊緊的關牢着，一家敞開的菜仔店里，有十幾個支那人，圍成一堆，正在爭論着一件事。他們底手中都有武器：如板刀，短木棍，手槍…據說為着防衛這些暴民再來紛擾，他們已把自己武裝起來，準備在必要時，幫助那勇敢的警長去敉平反叛。</p>
<p>可是有一個老支那人，却用憂慮的聲調吿訴我道：「我們底努力也許要白費的，這些土番們都很勇敢，一進來就像潮水一樣。只那牛皮鼓，吶喊聲！已足使我們害怕了。」停了一會，他又：「為着抵禦，我們已有十二個人被殺，其中有五個連頭顱也不知道下落的。…」他很憂慮，正沉在不安與頹唐里，眼睛就射着恐怖和絕望的光。</p>
<p>鄰接着不遠的一家小房子，有一種悽切的女人號哭聲，緩紓地透了過來，老人用手指着，又絕望地搖着頭道：「這是那些被殺害中的一個，年紀靑靑的，老婆還只從唐山過來不久，却碰到了這災難，已經三天了，頭還沒找到。…」我也同情地搖着頭。他沉默了一會才又低低的喃着道：</p>
<p>「這是一個苦難的年頭，…」我抬着頭向他看，他底眼窩已溢住淚水了。</p>

<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>當他們聽見我們說在前面山谷中看見時，都趕忙地向前跑去了。</p>
<p>我們的心臟都劇烈地跳起來了，我捉住了最後的一個人問道：「你們問那兩人是做什麽呵？」</p>
<p>「那兩人是迷香賊，有一種香使你聞着就暈倒了，他們在星子縣，做了兩件案子，還殺死了一個人呢？」</p>
<p>我們幾個年靑的夥伴那都驚住了，彷彿看見了那兩對發光的可怕的眼睛，才感到山野中原有恐佈的氣息。身上又被汗水浸透了，而是一種冷汗。（註：江西人普通對陌生人的稱呼）</p>

<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>「二十八這日子……今天十九，…明天二十，後天二十一，大後天二十二，二十三，二十四……連頭帶尾祗九天啦！」小根弟幾乎每天在心坎裏盤算。她總是覺得不如意，自己從小就冒着風霜雨雪的做，十一歲到眼前，眼前離開出嫁的日子祗九天了。可是媽依舊每天催着上工做活兒，依舊穿着那襲蘿蓆紋布衫，依舊讓頭髮如鳥窩般的堆在頭上，一切都沒有動情。</p>
<p>媽和爸忘掉了小根弟的嫁期似的，儘每天各忙着活兒。多怨恨哪。</p>
<p>在織襪機前，小根弟老思忖着：</p>
<p>爸和媽究竟懷着什麽心意？旣不願把女兒嫁人，何必早早的受人家的聘禮，現在把別人家的錢化了，就祗當沒這回事兒似的，這簡直是太糊塗了。嫁粧一層，雖辦不到什麽好塲面，可是幾具小傢伙，一些應時衣服……還有兩隻皮箱總是要的。到那日子，難道就呌我這樣空掛着手跑到人家去不成！」心事重了，生活亦就打折扣。</p>
<p>她帶着疲乏的身子和不愉快的心情回到家裏，王媒婆坐在媽鋪上跟媽商酌些什麽，她不敢堂而皇之地凑上去，要被爸罵「老臉」的，邊在生爐燉粥，邊竊聽着媽和王媒婆的話。可正在談皮箱這回兒事，媽多么吝嗇呵，她把王婆所要求的三隻皮箱完全拒絕了。還說什麽「他家這樣早把我女兒娶了去，我們老夫妻每月還有誰來貼補開支，祗好硬拚老骨頭了，再要我買這樣那樣，可辦不到咧。」這夜，王媒婆不快地走了的。</p>
<p>「媽，難道，一隻……一隻……皮箱……都沒拿過去嗎？人家亦化過錢的……日後呌我怎樣對人家……」小根弟耐不住的時候便對媽說。</p>
<p>這話，却是針一般的挑起了她爸的惱怒：「厚臉，厚臉，還提錢呢，那筆錢不是給你們兩個小鬼害瘟病害光了，死掉一個，留你這個活寳貝，又要像水樣的潑出去了。養大了滿想靠着活一些日子，你媽的，完全落空。你想撑面子，可是你投錯了人生，你不知道你娘老子窮嗎！」</p>
<p>一頓罵，小根弟坐在風爐邊嗚嗚咽咽的哭了。</p>
<p>媽究竟疼愛着女兒的，（爸又未嘗不疼愛女兒呢，只有窮困的生活太無情。）小根弟耳邊有着媽的慈愛的聲音：「你寬恕了你貧窮的爸和媽吧，誰又不是綳在錢上面的　好在，根弟吶；一個人是有着拿去八字的，你的命駐定好，將來別說皮箱，就是大衣橱亦容易振起來的，你的命駐定苦，卽使現在有金有銀有珍珠寳貝，亦會窮光完結。你過去，只要你丈夫規矩，自己巴結克苦一些，皮箱是容易的……」</p>
<p>小根弟稍稍抑止住悲哀，張着潤濕的眼睛望着她的媽。</p>
<p>「可是，你要明白，你爸不是那樣狠心的人，他知道你從小做到大，帮助着一家子活過來的。他祗是沒有錢，而且，你到人家去，家裏的開支就更……他的脾氣亦越變越壞」……四串眼淚一同掛下……</p>
<h3 id="c264">窓 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>在我的住房對過有一面窓，是一面小小的窓，隔着一條小小的衖堂。</p>
<p>我們這二面窓的間隔只有半丈那麽遠。夜晚，當左右的房子的燈都捻滅了，對過那面窓那柑黃色的燈光顯得異常暖和。我愛那面窓，它像一個謎，給我不少的啟示：多麽匆忙的人生呵！</p>
<p>當我初次搬來的時候，我開始注意到那面窓，它是這麽的親切呵！從那小小的窓洞里，我看見一個慈祥的母親的面影，摟抱着一個不滿週歲的嬰孩，那低低的催眠使她的兒子入睡，也把我迷醉了。一個失去了母親的愛撫的旅人，從這里分得了母性的慈愛了。</p>
<p>然而不久，在晚上，那面窓埋在無邊的黑暗里，沒有影，也沒有聲，像一座古墓那樣的荒凉，難堪的冷落打擊了我。於是我每每關上自己的窓子，再加上一重白布，房里雖然悶熱，然而我反覺安心，我害怕那面窓，我害怕那無邊的黑暗。</p>
<p>又不久，對面的窓口出現了一個異國的小女孩的蒼黃的臉。她時常憑着窓，用碧藍的眼睛注視着我。她的父親終日酗酒，身上骯髒得像一條剛出土時泥鰍，蓬鬆的鬍子，嘎啞的聲音，使我覺得他是一個落魄的人。夜半，那面窓還是光亮而且廠開，時時有啜泣同怒罵的聲音流過來。</p>
<p>一個月後，這人家又怱怱搬走了。我看見男的手里携着一個破箱，女的背上挽着一些零用東西拚成的包袱走了。於是那個小女孩的臉便像在夢中見過的一般，變得糢糊了。</p>
<p>也許再不久就另有人家搬進來吧！也許我的含淚的眼將再看見一些奇異的世態吧！我得感謝這面窓，它使我看到人世的各個不同的面貌。人生，多麽譎異，多么變幻呵。像追逐着什麽一般。人們怱怱來了，怱怱走了，究竟要走到什麽地方去呢？這些不曾疲乏的人生的旅客呵！</p>

<p>(Beiping) Bandits have been discovered on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan, numbering approximately 20,000. They are composed of bandits and call themselves the "Border Defense Autonomous Army," divided into two armies. The commander of the First Army has the surname Yu, and the commander of the Second Army has the surname Ma. They have already begun to harass the areas of Xinghe, Taolin, and Jining, forcibly requisitioning grain and grass, kidnapping and extorting ransoms, and committing all kinds of outrages. After the grain in the villages they occupy has been completely requisitioned, they expand outwards, attempting to actively advance westward. A portion of the bandit army was previously repelled by the troops of Zhao Chengshou stationed there. The various units of the garrison are still maintaining strict defense, and the situation in eastern Suiyuan is gradually becoming serious. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai stated that the Japanese Embassy has not yet received a report about the bandit invasion of eastern Suiyuan reported in the newspapers. He is not familiar with the recent situation in Inner Mongolia. The situation in North China is currently very calm, and there should be no changes. The Japanese authorities also hope that the people can live and work in peace and have no new expectations. The two Japanese criminals apprehended in the kidnapping case of Madam Zhu Shaoyang are not residents of Beiping and are currently under strict interrogation. (7th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nishida Koichi plans to return to Beiping next week. He said that he has not heard any information about the Suiyuan East incident, but he hopes that events can be discussed with sincerity and understanding, and that mutual understanding can be reached, so that major issues can be turned into minor ones. The Japanese side in Tianjin is paying close attention to the Suiyuan East incident. On the 7th, Tashiro convened a meeting of staff officers and military attachés at the Haiguang Temple Barracks, with Tashiro as the central figure. Attendees included Nagami, Ishii, Wachi, Nakamura Iida, Muta Kawaguchi, Eshima, and the heads of the Suiyuan-Zhangjiakou Special Service Agencies, Hazama, Omoto, Ueno, and over twenty others. First, Hazama reported on the recent situation in Suiyuan East and the situation of Li Shouxin's and De Wang's troops. Then, they discussed the current situation until 12:00 noon, after which Hazama immediately flew back to Suiyuan to observe the situation. Omoto is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou on the 8th. Chen Zhongfu visited Tashiro at 2:00 PM on the 7th to inquire about the current diplomatic situation.

Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi yesterday verified the rumors of war with news reporters in the province, and said that the overall situation is now calm, and he has ordered the garrison to vigorously resist if the enemy attacks again. Imai, the Japanese military attaché stationed in Beiping, told a guest today that he had not heard any news of the war in eastern Suiyuan, but the overall situation is indeed very tense, and he does not know the reason.

(7th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reports, the bandits who recently harassed eastern Suiyuan came from the direction of Shangdu. On the afternoon of July 20th, they briefly entered Suiyuan territory but were driven back after being attacked. On the 30th, several hundred bandits attacked Tumurtai in Bazhu County, Suiyuan territory, but retreated after failing. On August 2nd, more than 2,000 bandits attacked Honggen'ertu in Bazhu and were repelled by Peng Brigade of the Suiyuan garrison under Zhao Chengshou.

If the bandits attack again, they will resolutely defend with all their strength. It has been verified that the bandit army has a large number of cavalry and new-style weapons.

<h3 id="e51">Can England and Japan Truly Cooperate? <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors in Tokyo that England and Japan will cooperate, focusing on the development of China's economy. However, there has been little news of this kind in London.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty in reconciling the economic interests of England and Japan, Japan still has lingering feelings of attachment to England due to past traditional friendships. England also seems to still be unable to let go of the old dream of the "Anglo-Japanese Alliance" and hopes to achieve a compromise on the China issue, leading to compromises on issues throughout Asia and the world. This is true.</p>
<p>However, facts have proven that this is ultimately just a dream. After the September 18th Incident, the advance of Japan's continental policy caused a significant blow to England's economic interests in the Far East. England adopted a policy of accommodation. The report by the League of Nations investigation team led by the British national Lytton proposed a solution to the Northeast issue that actually favored Japan's interests. However, Japan not only ignored it but also acted arbitrarily, causing even greater damage to England's interests in the Far East. Last September, Sir Ross, an Englishman, came to China to adjust the economic interests of England and Japan in the Far East. He made a detour to Tokyo in the hope of gaining the understanding and cooperation of the Japanese authorities. As a result, he was rejected by the Japanese authorities. In June, Ross traveled east for the second time to reiterate the previous proposal, but he was again rebuffed. Although England repeatedly tried to court Japan, it was ultimately shattered by Japan's great desire to monopolize East Asia. This forced England to make some preparations for Japan. Over the past few years, it has been working very hard on all military and economic efforts south of the Yangtze River and in the Western Pacific. Recently, it has been actively expanding its armaments and building defense projects in the Hong Kong and Singapore areas. This is its concrete expression to Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, judging from the recent historical developments, unless Japan is willing to abandon its great desire to monopolize East Asia, Anglo-Japanese cooperation is difficult to expect. But in the past few days, the call for Anglo-Japanese cooperation has been widespread in Tokyo. What is the reason? Is Japan really willing to give up its great desire to monopolize East Asia? In our view, the recent military purge movement in Japan has come to an end. Many young officers have been sentenced. In order to control its subordinates in the future and avoid similar problems, the military had to urge the government to realize some of their usual demands. However, the "new administration" promised by the Hirota Cabinet was too broad in scope to be fully realized. Therefore, they had to work hard in the diplomatic field to achieve some results in order to preserve the government's position. Therefore, it wants to propose to England: Japan has no desire to invade Chinese territory; Japan respects England's vested interests in China, in order to recognize Japan's special position in the so-called East Asian stability sphere. Only in this way can it actively promote its so-called "active and independent" diplomacy towards China. This is probably just its one-sided intention. Would England accept it so easily? However, this is still a very noteworthy issue because it has a huge impact on China.</p>

<p>(Washington) The U.S. Department of Commerce released a report today analyzing China's international financial situation, stating that remittances from overseas Chinese have recently increased significantly and have become a good component of China's economic situation. There has been a significant increase compared to May. The reason is that the economic situation of overseas Chinese in British Malaya has greatly improved. The Ministry of Finance also mentioned the recent statement by Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, stating that after the reorganization of Guangdong's finances and the improvement of the monetary system, China's financial position will be greatly benefited. Most of the remittances from overseas Chinese are sent to South China, so in the future, these remittances should be able to more directly contribute to the balance of China's international finances. There is no official material available to verify the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in the United States. It is estimated to be between US$15 million and US$30 million per year. According to non-official sources, the commercial situation in the United States is also greatly improving, so the remittances from overseas Chinese this year should at least slightly increase compared to the sluggish situation of the past few years.

Part of this agreement allegedly states that, on the one hand, England recognizes "Manchukuo" and Japan's special position in North China, while on the other hand, Japan reaffirms its respect for China's territorial integrity, the open door policy, and England's vested interests in China. Although this rumor is rampant, a semi-official message from London published in Japanese newspapers today stated that the British government not only denies the above rumor but also stated that, under the current circumstances, it is extremely difficult to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations. The report also stated that the Japanese government has instructed Yoshida Shigeru to deal cautiously with the British proposals. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also explicitly denied this this morning. According to a summary of the Japanese government's views in today's Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Japan should welcome the British government's intention to recognize "Manchukuo," but the price is too high. In the Japanese government's eyes, England only possesses economic interests in China, while Japan possesses both political and economic interests, especially in North China.

It is rumored that the Rebel Leader has Landed in Spain. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The rebel army on the northern front of the Guadarrama front has repeatedly postponed its attack on Madrid. Today, 60,000 troops have been concentrated between Burgos and Madrid, indicating that the date of the general offensive is now imminent. According to reports from rebel aircraft, the Madrid government army has converted roadside houses into fortresses and erected machine guns, small steel cannons, and anti-aircraft guns. Both the government army and the rebel army are currently concentrating troops, and the number of people is the largest since the war began. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid: Rebel leader General Franco has arrived in Spain from Morocco. This is a prelude to an all-out attack on Madrid. It is rumored that he has established a headquarters in the Ritorba area, and it is expected that as soon as 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers transferred from Morocco land in Spain, they will begin to occupy Madrid. In the past few days, it is estimated that a total of 8,000 soldiers have set sail from Morocco. It is rumored that General Franco has accepted the request of the rebel generals and is preparing to personally control the new Spanish government in the future. According to telegraphic reports from the French side in Tangier, the entire air force of Spanish Morocco, totaling 50 new-style aircraft, is equipped with bombs and aerial torpedoes and is preparing to launch a large-scale attack on the government fleet outside the port of Malaga. The air force intends to first reduce the government fleet and then fly to Cordoba to assist General Franco's troops in that area.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government used radio to broadcast news that government troops had occupied Cadiz. This news has not yet been confirmed. If this is true, the rebels have lost a major port, and the rebels in Andalusia have been penetrated into the center by government troops. It is also said that government troops have recently almost reached the gateway to Granada, driving the rebels out of the Alhambra fortress, which is the key to the entire city. According to news from the French side in Tangier, a Spanish government gunboat was sunk by rebel bombers in yesterday's battle in the strait, and a submarine was also damaged by bombing.

<p>Lisbon: It is rumored that Chilean Ambassador to Spain, Mr. Machado, sent a telegram to his home government reporting on the extremely dangerous situation in Spain. This telegram was intercepted by the Portuguese radio station. The telegram stated that the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Spain are eager to leave the city due to the dangerous situation, but they have been unable to do so due to traffic congestion. They held a meeting the other day and decided that all ambassadors should gather in one embassy to await opportunities. The situation in the capital is hopeless. The Spanish government is only nominally in power, and the power is in the hands of the Red Militia and the Industrial Revolutionary Party. Various well-informed sources here believe that there will be no major changes in the Spanish situation in a few days, because the foreign troops and Moroccan troops transported from Morocco to mainland Spain by the rebels still need to be organized. The Moroccan rebels are now being transported to Spain in a steady stream. (7th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Washington) Authorities here announced today that dozens of giant aircraft will be added to the Hawaiian Islands. This is the Navy Department's plan to establish an "air bridge" between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland. A total of 60 aircraft are currently under construction, and half of them will be transferred to the Pacific. Although nominally to replace old aircraft, it is, in effect, reinforcement. The form and speed of each aircraft are superior to the old aircraft. Each aircraft can fly 2,500 miles in one go, and can fly directly from Hawaii via Wake Island to the Aleutian Islands. The first line of defense from Wake Island via Hawaii to Panama is thus strengthened. U.S. Acting Secretary of War Sterling General told reporters today that these aircraft will not fly to Hawaii in formation, but will fly to the area in groups of two or three. The date of departure of the first group is not yet known. (June 6th Guomin)</p>

<p>— Our Reporter, Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(8) Department Stores</p>
<p>On the day we visited the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, we visited two large department stores in Osaka.</p>
<p>That morning, it rained heavily. When we walked out of the hotel, we saw the rain scene of this big city, which had a different kind of flavor. Most of the pedestrians on the street, men and women, were stepping on high wooden platforms and wearing paper umbrellas or cloth umbrellas. There were very few people wearing raincoats like us. All the tires of the cars were hung with rubber strips or palm brushes to prevent the mud and water on the road from splashing on the pedestrians when driving.</p>
<p>We have to go to the Hankyu Department Store near the hotel, we must cross the wide road in front of Osaka Station where vehicles are densely packed. It must be difficult to cross such a road when it is raining heavily, but Osaka's perfect traffic management system allows us to walk over without panic. There are very few traffic police on the streets of Osaka, and the traffic order is maintained entirely by machinery. The traffic lights on the road have three colors: red, green, and yellow, and they light up in turn by electrical automatic devices. There are also a series of large copper nails on the road marking the crosswalk. Pedestrians can wait for the green light to turn on and cross the road from the crosswalk. It doesn't matter if you are bolder and cross when the yellow light is on.</p>
<p>Entering the door of the Bankyu Department Store is a very large hall. Many people were walking back and forth there. From there, you can enter the Hanshin Elevated Railway Station. This train station will soon be connected to Osaka Station, which is tens of meters away. The underground passage project between the two is currently underway. We took the elevator in the hall and browsed everything in the various departments of the Hankyu Department Store. The scale of this department store seems to be much larger than Shanghai's Sincere and Wing On, but it does not have the hotels and amusement parks attached to Sincere and Wing On. The goods in each department have many patterns. It looks like more than 90% are domestic goods. To what extent Japan's industry has developed can be well understood from there. There is a painting exhibition hall, a mannequin display room, and a special sales market with a uniform price of ten cents and fifty cents. There is a photography studio where you can pick up the photos within an hour. The most noteworthy is the large canteen on the seventh floor.</p>
<p>This large canteen occupies the entire seventh floor of the building, selling Japanese, Chinese, and Western food at low prices. The very spacious hall is filled with large and small dining tables that can accommodate two or three thousand diners. Two rows of glass cabinets display various colorful foods and drinks, each labeled with its name and price. A cup of coffee costs only five cents. A Western Lunch (simple meal) costs only thirty cents. There are also several varieties of Chinese food, such as egg fried rice and Chinese noodles. The name "China Lunch" is the most peculiar. It is a large plate of mixed side dishes and a large bowl of white rice, priced at thirty cents. We walked into the cafeteria, it was lunch time. The cafeteria was packed with people. We searched for a long time before finding two empty seats next to a large table. Then a waitress came over, calculated the value of the drinks and food we wanted to order, and sent us to a female shopkeeper at the door counter to buy a few small food coupons (there are about ten kinds of food coupons, from five cents to fifty cents) because the rule there is to pay first and then eat. In a few minutes, the drinks and food we ordered were moved from the kitchen window to our front.</p>
<p>After lunch, we walked out of the Hankyu Department Store. After visiting the Mainichi Shimbun in the afternoon, we took the tram to Namba Shinchi in the southern district.</p>
<p>The tram fare in Osaka, like other major cities in Japan, adopts a uniform system. No matter how far or near, it is seven cents one way and fourteen cents round trip. The ticket sellers on the tram are all women, and they provide very attentive service to passengers. At each stop, they shout the name of the station and ask those who want to get off to get off. After the car starts, they report that the next station is something and ask those who want to get off to prepare in advance. When passengers get off, the ticket seller takes back the ticket and tears it up. If you want to change trains, she will give you another larger ticket with a drawing of the tram route, with holes punched in the names of the destination and the transfer station. It is very convenient for passengers to change trains according to the route on the ticket.</p>
<p>We saw a purely Japanese-style street scene in Namba Shinchi. This is one of the bustling centers of Osaka's southern district. The streets are not very wide, and there are mostly Japanese-style houses on both sides. We strolled along the street for a while and walked into the most magnificent building in that area, the "Nankai Takashimaya". The interior layout of this department store is similar to that of the Hankyu Department Store, but the high-priced goods do not seem to be as complete as those of the Hankyu.</p>
<p>In addition to Hankyu and Nankai Takashimaya, there are five other large department stores in Osaka: Mitsukoshi, Daimaru, Jidai, Matsuzakaya, and Takashimaya. None of these big department stores started out as small silk shops (silk and cloth shops). With the annual development of business, the general small shops have suffered a great blow in business? In recent years, small shops have organized associations to resist the power of large department stores through the strength of unity. The department store industry has also formed an association, creating a united front for department stores. When the business competition between the two sides reached a fever pitch, the Osaka Prefectural Office, the City Hall, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry often came forward to mediate.</p>

<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, the French government drafted a non-intervention agreement last night and submitted it to the relevant countries. The content stipulates that the signatory countries shall not sell all kinds of military weapons, military and civilian aircraft, and various warships to Spain. The British government has accepted this draft agreement and will support France's position before the governments of the relevant countries. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government previously sent notes to Britain, Italy, Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Portugal, advocating the conclusion of an agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. According to responsible sources, the government will soon issue a second note reiterating the previous proposal and listing specific measures for implementing non-intervention. It is reported that France insists that even contracts already signed should not be fulfilled regarding the prohibition of arms shipments to Spain. So far, most countries have expressed their support for France's first note. Portugal, however, has not yet responded because Foreign Minister Monteiro is currently abroad, and the French ambassador to Portugal, Amié Breleau, will not officially contact the Portuguese government until tomorrow. However, informed sources predict that the Portuguese government will also follow the example of other countries and express its support. It is now known that the British government has begun negotiations on this matter with the Portuguese ambassador to Britain in London. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Seven countries have responded, expressing their support for France's note on a joint declaration of non-intervention in Spain, with Italy being one of them. France is currently busy drafting the full text of the agreement. Of the eight countries contacted by France, only Portugal has not yet responded. In total, Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia agree to non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. It is reported that the agreement currently being drafted aims to prohibit the sale of weapons, bullets, war materials, aircraft, and warships to any party in Spain, Spanish Morocco, or any region under Spanish jurisdiction, and to urge the governments concerned to notify each other of the measures they intend to take to implement the ban on the export of military materials. All types of aircraft are also included in the ban. Once the agreement is drafted, it will be sent to the relevant governments. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Britain Raises Reservations <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government's views on the draft agreement on non-intervention in Spain proposed by the French government were notified to the French ambassador to London, Corbin, this morning. It is reported that the main difficulty for the British government is the proposal to prohibit the sale of civilian aircraft, as the British government has no power to do so and does not wish to take this special step. The British government believes that the 1925 Geneva Convention is an appropriate basis for the definition of ammunition or war equipment. The Foreign Office only received the French draft yesterday, which was also sent to Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Italy and Germany's Attitudes Are Unpredictable <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(London) Political figures here are quite pessimistic about the prospects for an agreement among the countries concerned on "non-intervention in the Spanish civil war." First, from the Italian perspective, although the Italian government has expressed support in principle for the French proposal, it will raise three questions, requiring France to answer them, namely: (1) Whether expressing sympathy in spirit for one of the warring parties in Spain, such as through demonstrations, newspaper propaganda, donations, and volunteer enlistment, is equivalent to interfering in its civil war; (2) Whether the non-intervention agreement will be universally participated in by the countries concerned, or whether it will only bind the signatory governments, or whether it will apply to the people and private enterprises of each country at the same time; (3) Whether the French government intends to take supervisory measures to ensure that all countries uniformly abide by the non-intervention agreement. Political figures here believe that if Mussolini raises these questions as conditions for Italy's accession to the "non-intervention" agreement, then the French proposal will inevitably fail, and the resulting impact on the international tension will inevitably become more serious, which is truly worrying. Currently, in order to avoid the failure of negotiations, the French government should apply to the Italian government to change its attitude. The British government will also instruct its ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, to strongly plead with the Italian government, so as to support France's position. Second, even if Italy is willing to participate in the non-intervention agreement, Germany's attitude is still unknown. It is rumored that Germany will also raise similar questions as conditions for joining the agreement. In addition, the German government has protested to the Spanish government over the shooting of members of the National Socialist Youth Party by Spanish communists. If the Spanish government cannot provide a satisfactory response, Germany and Italy will openly assist the Spanish rebels. If this is the case, then the negotiation of the "non-intervention" agreement will be even more difficult to succeed. According to informed sources here, it is feared that the Spanish government has difficulty in properly protecting the safety of foreigners. In the event that incidents of harming foreigners occur again, then Germany and Italy will inevitably intervene. Third, the Soviet Union is reportedly demanding that several countries immediately cease assisting the Spanish rebels. This demand is clearly aimed at Germany and Italy. In summary, although Britain and France are taking a conciliatory attitude and doing their best to prevent Europe from being divided into two major groups of Fascism and anti-Fascism, it is feared that this attempt will ultimately fail.

<h3 id="e93">Development of the Spanish Civil War Deteriorates the International Situation, Causing Great Anxiety Among British and French Figures <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>(London) The daily development of the situation in the Spanish civil war is making the international situation increasingly worse, causing great anxiety among British figures. According to the Daily Herald, the German East Africa Line's steamship "Usaramo" carried 28 bomber aircraft, machine guns, and a batch of ammunition, as well as many pilots and engineers, ostensibly heading to East Africa, but in reality being sent to the Spanish rebel leader, General Franco. After the release of this news, the anxiety of the general public has increased even more. In addition, after four members of the German National Socialist Youth Party in Barcelona, Spain, were executed by Spanish communists a few days ago, the German consul in the city, Köhler, protested to the government of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia. Certain British figures deeply fear that Germany will brazenly occupy the Spanish island of Menorca (belonging to the Balearic Islands) as a guarantee of obtaining a satisfactory response. Also, General Franco seems to intend to prevent Spanish government warships from entering the international neutral port of Tangier. France is unlikely to allow Franco to do as he pleases, thus causing entanglements. All of these are concerns of British figures. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the government proposed to Britain, Italy, Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Portugal to conclude an agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, most of these countries expressed their acceptance of the proposal "in principle." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently working on drafting an implementation plan, but observers believe that the progress of this matter may cause technical difficulties. In addition, news from various capitals is causing unease. Some people are concerned that this external effort is already too late. For example, unofficial sources in Berlin claim that the German government is likely to take the opportunity to either intervene in the port of Mahon on the Spanish island of Menorca (in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean) to block the Spanish eastern port of Barcelona, or send troops to land at the port of Ceuta in Spanish Morocco. As for France, the executive committee of the Communist Party has launched a private fundraising campaign to collect funds to support the Spanish "comrades" of the party. At the same time, right-wing nationalists, while acknowledging that the relationship between Italy and Germany and the Spanish rebel leader General Franco is too close, and that France's position in the Mediterranean will be weakened, believe that if the Spanish communists were to win, the harm would be terrifying. Therefore, they advocate that the countries concerned should strictly maintain neutrality on the civil war and not take sides. In addition, news from Moscow claims that although the Soviet government has expressed its acceptance of the French non-intervention proposal in principle, workers everywhere have raised large sums of money to donate to the Madrid government, totaling no less than 36 million francs. As for Italy, the recent aircraft incident in French Algeria, according to the results of the French authorities' investigation, proves that the aircraft indeed belonged to the Italian regular air force and were sent to Spanish Morocco to join the Spanish rebels. Moreover, leftist figures here are widely spreading rumors that when 4,000 troops of the Spanish rebel General Franco crossed the Strait of Gibraltar yesterday on four steamships, several Italian aircraft soared through the sky, escorting them along the way. All of these have already caused fear and doubt. In addition, Italy's response to France's proposal reportedly contains many reservations, which only increases the sense of fear and doubt.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia According to news from Athens, after the Greek Prime Minister Metaxas dissolved the Chamber of Deputies and implemented a dictatorial regime, all left-wing parties, including the Liberal Party led by former Prime Minister Sophoulis (i.e., the right-wing elements of the former Prime Minister Venizelos's old ministry), expressed their opposition. The government then ordered a large-scale search for opposition elements. Of the Communist Party deputies, a total of 15, except for the leader Stathopoulos, who is in Switzerland and escaped the dragnet, the other 14 were arrested. Liberal Party deputies Gassos and university professor Varotsis were also arrested. Prime Minister Metaxas recently notified the diplomatic envoys of various countries that he had to implement a dictatorial regime because Communist Party members were wantonly carrying out activities that endangered the current political system of the country. As for the military, all members of the Military Association recently declared that they would provide full support to Metaxas, but on the condition that the current positions of officers in the military not be changed. It is reported that the former Minister of the Army, General Papagos, the current Chief of Staff, contributed greatly during the establishment of the dictatorial regime. At this time, the army's vigilance is still extremely strict, with cavalry, gendarmerie, and police densely deployed on the streets of the capital, patrolling back and forth, and all public institutions and strategic locations are guarded by the military.

<p>(Washington) The 33rd World Catholic Eucharistic Congress will be held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, from February 3 to 7 next year. At that time, ships will gather in Manila Bay. American Catholics have reserved four postal ships, and European ships will also circumnavigate the world, carrying Catholics to the meeting. The 32nd Congress was held last year in the capital of Argentina. For four centuries, the Philippines has been a devout Catholic country, the leader of the Far East. It is said that when Magellan's expedition arrived in the Philippines, the natives of Cebu already had statues of the Santo Niño. The Catholic Church in Manila is also one of the most beautiful Catholic buildings in the world. Therefore, the Catholic authorities believe that Manila is the most appropriate location for the first Congress in the Far East. On February 2 next year, the Pope's representative will arrive in Manila. The Congress will officially open at 5 p.m. the following day. The 4th will be Women's Day, the 5th will be Men's Day, the 6th will be Children's Day, and the 7th will be a Mass service. In mid-April of this year, the Standing Committee of the Congress held a meeting in Paris to prepare everything. The number of representatives from each country is estimated to be 30. As for the number of attendees next year, there is no official estimate at present. In view of the long journey and high cost, it will not be as grand as the previous congresses in Chicago, Dublin, and Buenos Aires, but there will still be representatives from all over the world attending the meeting.

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence There are a total of five highways connecting Fujian Province with neighboring provinces: one is from Zhejiang to Fuding in Fujian, which is the first Fujian-Zhejiang trunk road; the second is from Zhejiang to Pucheng in northern Fujian, which is the second Fujian-Zhejiang trunk road; the third is from Jiangxi to Shaowu in northern Fujian, which is the first Fujian-Jiangxi trunk road; the fourth is from Jiangxi to Changting in western Fujian, which is the second Fujian-Jiangxi trunk road; and the fifth is from Guangdong to Yongding in western Fujian, which is the Fujian-Guangdong trunk road. Currently, except for the first Fujian-Zhejiang trunk road, which is still under construction, the other four trunk roads have been completed and opened to traffic. Among them, the second Fujian-Zhejiang trunk road has the longest route, starting from Pucheng on the Zhejiang border, passing through Jianyang, Jian'ou, and connecting to Shaowu, which can lead to Guangze in Jiangxi, then passing through Nanping, Shaxian, Yong'an, and Liancheng, connecting to Changting, which can lead to Ruijin in Jiangxi, and then passing through Longyan and Yongding, which can lead to Dabu in Guangdong. Recently, the Department of Construction plans to build a trunk highway from Minhou, passing through Gutian to Jian'ou, to connect with the second Fujian-Zhejiang trunk road in Pucheng and the first Fujian-Jiangxi trunk road in Shaowu. Currently, the section from Gutian to Jian'ou, which is more than 130 kilometers long, has been surveyed by the surveying team of the National Economic Commission. The Department of Construction has sent engineer Huang Xuan of the Highway General Engineering Office to supervise the construction. The total project cost requires 100,000 yuan, and the provincial government will allocate a portion for application soon. As for the section from Minhou to Gutian, construction will be planned as soon as the terrain survey is clear. After the completion of the project in the future, one can take a long-distance bus from Fuzhou directly to Jiangxi and Zhejiang, and one can also take a long-distance bus from Zhejiang and Jiangxi, passing through Fuzhou directly to Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and other places in southern Fujian. Transportation between the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang will definitely be more convenient than before. In order to improve the health of the people of Fujian Province, the Fujian Provincial Government has increased the health expenditure in the budget for the 25th year of the Republic by 350,000 yuan, which will be used exclusively for handling provincial health administration, providing medical assistance, and preventing and controlling epidemics. The Third Section of the Department of Civil Affairs will be changed to the Health Section, with Lu Dihuan appointed as the section chief. Under it, there will be three groups: General Affairs, Medicine, and Epidemic Prevention, with Cao Shouli and others appointed as the group leaders. There will also be four technical officers and more than 20 technicians to manage provincial health administration matters. Health offices will be established in Fuzhou and Xiamen to manage public health and epidemic prevention and medical treatment in the two urban areas. They are currently being prepared and will be established soon. In addition, four mobile medical teams will be established to tour various counties, providing medical treatment for the people and providing necessary medicines free of charge. They were organized and established the day before yesterday. Each team will have one director, two doctors, five nurses, and five assistants. The first medical team in the first phase has been designated to depart for Zhenghe, the second medical team to depart for Jiangle, the third medical team to depart for Longyan, and the fourth medical team to depart for Putian, touring various counties. In addition to providing medical treatment for the people, they will also guide the people on health knowledge, so that people can be healthy and increase their working ability.</p>
<p>Fujian Province's various special products, such as tea, wood, paper, dried bamboo shoots, sugar, tobacco leaves, mushrooms, aquatic vegetables, as well as lacquerware, porcelain, umbrellas, and leather cases, used to be very famous. In recent years, due to the lack of improvement in manufacturing methods, sales have decreased day by day, and the local economy has suffered greatly. In order to design to improve special products and promote sales, the Department of Construction held the first provincial special products competition in West Lake Park in Fuzhou last autumn. There were many products from various counties, and the results were very good. Now, in order to continue to urge the progress of various special products, the Department of Construction has decided to hold the second provincial special products competition in Zhangzhou in October of this year.

<h3 id="e101">The Zheng Family Uncovers Zheng Xu's Scandal, Zheng Xu Falsely Claims to Be a Descendant of Koxinga, Attempting to Be a Traitor in a Certain Conspiracy, the Fake Bureau is Exposed and He is Arrested in Taiwan <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence Recently, the Zheng Family Association of Shijing, Nan'an, and the Zheng Family Association of Xiamen uncovered Zheng Xu, who falsely claimed to be a descendant of Koxinga and acted as a traitor. This has had a great impact and happened very quickly. First, not long after the Fujian Incident, there was a Zheng Xu who claimed to be the 12th generation grandson of Koxinga, active in Japanese society. Some Japanese people and the Japanese military regarded him as a treasure and escorted him back to Taiwan to form the "Zheng Family Relics Manifestation Association." On the surface, it was an academic group studying Koxinga's life deeds and words, and a social movement to study Koxinga arose in Japan and Taiwan. Zheng Xu, as a descendant, was ostensibly a central figure, surrounded by a group of people, led by a retired major, who was no less than Zheng Xu's manager. For this reason, the Japanese believed that Koxinga's father, Zhilong, married a Japanese woman from Hirado, Tagawa, who gave birth to Koxinga, and recognized Koxinga as also being of Japanese descent. Koxinga's lifelong achievements were to support the Ming Dynasty and resist the Qing Dynasty, drive out the Dutch, and rule Taiwan for three generations. Taiwan has since been freed from white rule and become a national hero. They took pride in his mother being Japanese and wanted to manifest this. After the association was established, it tried its best to search for Koxinga's cultural relics (a vertical scroll with Koxinga's own handwriting, "Only Heaven is above, and no mountain is equal, raising my head the red sun is near, turning my head white clouds are low," was stolen from the home of a certain Mr. in Anhai, Quanzhou in the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic. Later, it was rumored that someone bought it for 200,000 yuan, which was published in the newspapers. In the summer of the 24th year of the Republic, this scroll was prominently displayed at the Xiamen Taiwan Association Exhibition, and the exhibitor was a Taiwanese named Mr. Wu), and elaborately promoted it. On the one hand, Koxinga's loyalty and integrity are admired by the Chinese people. The people of Fujian, especially those in southern Fujian and Taiwanese who migrated from southern Fujian to Taiwan, have a sacredness to him. Emperor Longwu of the Ming Dynasty gave Koxinga the imperial surname, and Emperor Yongli granted him the title of Prince of Yanping. To this day, the people of Fujian call Koxinga "Imperial Surname Lord" or "Prince of Yanping" instead of his name. The general custom is to directly replace his name with the two characters "Imperial Surname." The Zheng family relics are called "Imperial Surname Tomb," "Imperial Surname Shrine," and "Imperial Surname Well." The depth of their worship can be seen. Therefore, a certain conspiracy wanted to use the psychology of the people of Fujian's worship of Koxinga, and use Koxinga's descendants to carry out a certain separatist movement, with Zheng Xu as the future "South China puppet." Not long after the Fujian Incident, a certain party had a "South China State" conspiracy, but it failed immediately. A certain party then changed to using Zheng Xu. For the past two years, their planning has almost become an open secret and is well known to the people of Fujian. They are also heartbroken that Koxinga has such an unworthy descendant. Koxinga's national consciousness is extremely strong. His support for the Ming Dynasty and resistance to the Qing Dynasty never relied on foreign forces. He dominated southern Fujian, attacked Nanjing in the north, and occupied Taiwan, and never relied on the Japanese pirates who plagued the coastal areas at that time during his lifetime and even for three generations. Recently, the Zheng Family Association of Shijing, Nan'an, Koxinga's hometown, and the Zheng Family General Association of Xiamen jointly published notices in various newspapers in Taiwan, denying that Zheng Xu was a descendant of Koxinga. The notice stated, "After investigation, the Shijing Imperial Surname line has only passed down to the 11th generation, and the 12th generation grandson has not yet been born." This is almost a conclusive proof to refute Zheng Xu as an imposter. After the notice was published, the whole of Taiwan was in an uproar. The Taiwan authorities arrested Zheng Xu and sent him to the military. According to the Zheng family, Zheng Xu is actually from Fuzhou. A few years ago, he passed through Shijing, Nan'an, visited Koxinga's descendants, and paid homage to the Koxinga Ancestral Hall, copying the Koxinga genealogy. At that time, they thought he was worshiping the martyrs and treated him with great courtesy. Later, Xu went to Japan and Taiwan and claimed to be a descendant of Koxinga. The Taiwanese people welcomed him warmly because he talked about the situation of Koxinga's descendants, the ancient relics, ancestral halls, tombs, and the family lineage in an orderly manner, and no one doubted him. Later, Xu was often surrounded by a large number of entourage in Taiwan, opened large hotels, and behaved like an important person. Finally, someone learned that he was colluding with scattered bandits in Fujian, engaging in puppet state activities, and had a certain party background. Therefore, it was widely spread and heard among the Koxinga family members in Shijing, who then exposed his impersonation and issued this notice. The traitor was finally exposed. This move swept away the shadows in the hearts of the people of Fujian and won back a breath for the "Imperial Surname Lord." The matter happened quickly and the impact is not small. (August 6)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Cantonese Merchants Petition for the Abolition of Harsh Taxes <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Also Petition for the Abolition of Monopoly on Sugar and Native Tobacco Leaves</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the renovation of the Guangdong Bureau, the government has first declared the prohibition of opium and gambling, and the abolition of all kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. The merchants and people are all eagerly awaiting the government to implement the above new policies as soon as possible, in order to relieve the difficulties of merchants and maintain the livelihood of the people of Guangdong. Recently, various merchants have presented to the authorities the harsh and detailed taxes, requesting that they be exempted separately. Those who have appealed daily include: (1) Match merchants. It is found that the match industry in Guangdong Province originally had more than 100 factories. Since the implementation of the unified match tax, each basket of 1,200 boxes of matches must pay a unified tax of three yuan and eight jiao, and a raw material tax of one yuan. The heavy tax on domestically produced matches has led to high costs, making it difficult to compete with foreign matches, resulting in a slump in business. Now the merchants have jointly presented to the authorities, requesting a reduction in the unified tax in order to maintain their business. (2) Coal merchants. Previously, the Special Agricultural Products Tax Bureau levied a special import tax on foreign coal, which not only increased the burden on merchants, but also affected industry. They have again jointly requested the Finance Department to abolish the special coal tax. (3) Special tax on foreign rice. After the Finance Department abolished it, it has recently been levied by the customs. Rice merchants, unaware of the reason, have recently had five rice boats detained by the customs. The Rice Bran Association yesterday sent representatives to negotiate with the Guangdong Customs, and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend the levy of foreign rice tax in order to maintain the people's food supply. In addition, various monopoly businesses that compete with the people for profit are close to speculation, raising prices and making people's lives difficult. Those who are currently requesting the abolition of monopolies include: (1) Sugar merchants from various places. Hong Kong sugar merchants sent representatives to the province yesterday to contact local sugar merchants and discuss submitting a petition to the Finance Department to abolish the sugar monopoly. (2) Monopoly on native tobacco leaves. The abuses are serious. Tobacco merchants submitted a petition yesterday requesting its abolition. The petition reads as follows: "(Omitted above) The tobacco tax in Guangdong Province has always been harsh, with a wide variety of tax items. The tobacco tax in Guangdong Province has been monopolized, and the tax rate is 100% of the value, which is twice as high as the original tax. At this time when the people of Guangdong are impoverished, how can they bear the sudden increase in burden? Therefore, on the day of implementation, all tobacco merchants in the province felt the pain of the industry dying. In the past few months, due to poor management, those with inventory are suffering from the indefinite purchase, and those who need it are also suffering from the inability to purchase. To this day, tobacco merchants are heavily taxed and their businesses are exhausted, and they are on the verge of death. The suffering of tobacco farmers is even more countless. The small increase in revenue has caused suffering to the people of Guangdong. Is this the original intention of the government to care for the difficulties of merchants? The merchants are in deep pain and are waiting to be rescued. They dare to present this matter and implore the government to investigate and quickly order the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Unified Tax Bureau to abolish the monopoly on native tobacco leaves on a specific date, follow the central tax system, follow the precedents of various provinces, unify the tax collection, in order to relieve the people's difficulties and care for the merchants' hardships. The telegraph cannot express the anxiety and anticipation. Sincerely, Guangzhou Tobacco Industry Association."</p>

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: The provincial government previously presented the Education Department's plan for adding free elementary schools and increasing temporary expenses in the 25th year of the Republic of China, and a list of new elementary schools.

Subsequently, a reply was received, stating, "It is found that the local self-raised funds for compulsory education in the next year and the establishment of short-term primary school classes, etc., should be increased by more than double compared to this year. In addition to the amount of self-raised funds allocated to each county listed in the original plan, the self-raised funds for compulsory education in Gansu Province in the next year should still be appropriately listed in the provincial budget, and the number of short-term primary schools to be added in the next year, in addition to the number of schools listed in the original table, should still be planned by the Education Department to increase by at least double compared to this year, and they must all be opened completely when school starts in the autumn, so that the popularization of compulsory education can be realized as soon as possible."

<p>Li Hengji Rice Shop in Huayang Town, outside the East Gate of this county, has been quite prosperous in business on weekdays. Recently, taking advantage of the smuggling trend, it purchased dozens of packages of fertilizer from Minhang, making huge profits. It then hired a boat to transport them to Songjiang, selling them gradually along the way. When it arrived at the Qiujing Port near Desheng Port, only seven packages remained unsold. This was discovered by Inspector Guo of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed there, who suspected that the fertilizer was smuggled and immediately sent police to detain the boat and cargo, and escorted the boatman to the First District Department of Minhang for investigation. It is said that after the incident, the owner of the shop tried to bribe people to intercede, but the First District Department refused his request, and the situation is likely to escalate. Such smuggling activities should be severely punished.</p>

<p>Hu Yimao Wine Shop in Yuewang Market, the Fifth District of the county, has two stores, east and west. Hu Youhe, the owner of the east store, had a slight surplus of money, which had long been coveted by bandits. Fortunately, the owner took strict precautions and nothing had happened. At midnight on the 5th, during a torrential rain, seven robbers suddenly came. Two bandits were on the lookout outside, and the remaining bandits, unable to enter the room, climbed onto the roof of the backyard and broke through the roof. Zhang Laogen, the wine clerk, had served in the shop since childhood, was unusually strong, had a lot of integrity, and was deeply loved by the owner. He was the first to be awakened and looked out to see a figure. He hid in the dark to observe his actions and saw the bandits trying to enter the owner's bedroom. He bravely stepped forward and hugged the leader of the bandits around the waist, preventing him from moving. Seeing this, the remaining bandits fired two shots at Zhang, one hitting his waist and one hitting his leg. He still didn't feel anything and fought bravely. Because he was outnumbered, he broke free and shouted, running to the street before falling to the ground and dying. After Zhang went out, the robbers searched and looted, taking the stolen goods and heading southeast. After the incident, it was found that more than 500 yuan of jewelry and silver dollars had been robbed. The county was immediately notified to investigate and arrest the robbers. The body was taken to the scene for examination by Examiner Shen Cheng and the forensic officer. After being properly dressed, it was handed over to the family for burial.</p>

<p>The Yuehan Railway is Completed</p>
<p>Documents Designated for Agency Takeover</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that in order to complete the Zhushao section of the Yuehan Railway, the Ministry of Railways, together with the Ministry of Finance, issued 6% British Gold Gengkuan Public Bonds in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. At that time, in accordance with the regulations of the public bonds, it jointly organized the "6% British Gold Gengkuan Public Bond Debt Custody Committee" with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department, and the Sino-British Gengkuan Board of Trustees to handle the custody and disbursement of all debt funds. The committee has been established since July of the 23rd year and has been in operation for two years. According to reports from Dagong News Agency reporters, the total amount of debt funds received by the committee over the past two years has reached £1,350,000, which has been allocated to the Yuehan Railway Bureau for the construction of the Zhushao section. Now that the Ministry of Railways has found that the construction of the section has been completed and the debt funds held by the committee have been fully disbursed, in accordance with Article 8 of the committee's organizational regulations, "dissolution on the date when the debt funds are fully disbursed," the committee will be closed and dissolved. All documents, files, official seals, and account books of the committee have been taken over and kept by personnel sent by the Ministry of Railways together with the receiving agency designated by the Ministry of Finance. After being ordered to handle the closure, the committee has reported to the Ministry of Railways for record and has sent separate letters to all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Change in the Principles of Property Re-Mortgage Rights <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Supported by the Banking and Money Industries</p>
<p>Consultation on Detailed Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, in view of the fact that the real estate industry is the most important asset in the market, but the real estate industry has been affected by the global economic recession for many years, with prices plummeting and transactions disappearing, resulting in a lack of assets, in order to increase the assets in the market and save the real estate industry, has resolved to jointly request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, to change the property re-mortgage rights. For example, if A mortgages the property to B, and then B re-mortgages it to C, if B is liquidated, C has no priority right. Now, the request is to still give C priority right. The Banking Association has approved the request to change the re-mortgage rights in principle. Yesterday, it replied to the Real Estate Industry Association, but the detailed measures must be agreed upon by the three organizations in a joint meeting. After research, the Money Industry Association also approved the principle, but it must be passed by the ten-day executive committee before replying to the Real Estate Industry Association.</p>

Under the supervision of the Ministry of Railways, the railway was required to deposit a special debt repayment reserve monthly from its operating income. Since the funds have been repaid successively, the credit has been fully repaid as of recently. The railway bureau has formally notified the Sino-British Company to cancel and invalidate the previously signed contract for purchasing cars on credit.</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that our country's annual waste cotton exports reach more than 10 million yuan. The United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and other countries purchase large quantities. This item is used to manufacture gunpowder raw materials. Recently, the Jianghai Customs issued an order prohibiting exports, because our country needs to use waste cotton to help refugees who have no clothes to cover their bodies. Since the issuance of the order, British, American, and German merchants have raised no objections, but the Japanese merchants residing in Shanghai, the people of our friendly nation, have unreasonably opposed it in a group, which is very intense.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Ministry of Communications' Zhabei Long-Distance Telephone Station Opens for Calls at Midnight Today, Temporarily Using 20 Pairs of Sending and Receiving Relay Lines, and the Transmission Wave Amplifying Machine is Activated at the Same Time <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that the Zhabei Long-Distance New Telephone Station built by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is located south of Yongxing Road on Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei, adjacent to the east of the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The land area is 0.56 mu, and a three-story Western-style building with cement and steel frames has been built. The ground floor is divided into (1) a power generation room, (2) an electrical porcelain room, (3) an amplifier room, and (4) a repair room. The front part of the middle floor is the international wireless telephone room, and the back part is the long-distance telephone exchange. The upper floor is a dormitory. The construction is quite novel and beautiful.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Lines</p>
<p>The materials and machines used in the station were ordered from the United Kingdom. There are 40 pairs of long-distance telephone sending and receiving relays. 20 pairs will be activated temporarily, distributing them to various places along the Jinghu and Huhangyong routes, and for the long-distance telephones that have been opened in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The remaining 20 pairs will be used after the completion of the Nine Provinces Telephone.</p>
<p>Midnight Calls</p>
<p>Since the completion of the new station building, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has been installing various machines one after another, which has been completed. Since August 4th, continuous test calls have been made with various places, and the results have been excellent. Therefore, it has been decided to officially open for calls at 12:30 AM today. At that time, Director Xu Xueyu, Chief Engineer Yu Bingjian, together with the heads of the Long-Distance Department and the Zhabei Branch, Fan and Zhu, will supervise the staff and preside over the call affairs.</p>
<p>Booster Amplification</p>
<p>Long-distance telephones, whenever there is wind and rain, sometimes encounter obstacles due to the distance, and the sound waves are considerably affected. Now, in order to boost the radio waves and increase the sound waves, the station has specially attached a booster amplification machine. Regardless of the distance, it can increase the sound waves at any time, which is a special feature of our country's long-distance telephone equipment. The machine will also be activated at the same time when the calls are made.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Rong Zongjing Speaks on Using Cotton and Iron to Save the Nation: Smuggling Runs Rampant, Threatening the Yarn Industry; The National Economic Council Plans Relief Measures <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The national yarn industry is increasingly threatened by the encroachment of foreign yarn. Major figures in the yarn industry are exchanging opinions on how to survive. A reporter from the Industrial News visited Rong Zongjing, a leading figure in the yarn industry, to inquire about his views. He replied that China's yarn industry has a long history. When Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong served as Minister of Industry, he loudly advocated using cotton and iron to save the nation. Later, Mr. Nie Yuntai also actively advocated revitalizing the textile industry to save China. He himself (Rong Zongjing referring to himself) also absolutely advocated implementing the plan of using cotton and iron to save the nation. However, times have changed, and the market has gradually become depressed. Production and sales are not balanced, and supply even exceeds demand. The reason is the influence of foreign yarn dumping. In recent years, the business of Chinese yarn factories has declined day by day, and now they are almost completely unable to maintain themselves. Currently, smuggling is rampant, and the yarn industry is on the verge of collapse. Although the authorities of various factories are exchanging opinions on how to save the situation, it is unpredictable whether they can be realized. Without concrete measures, shouting for self-rescue will be in vain. In recent days, Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council, has also convened several meetings. A concrete plan to rescue the yarn industry has been largely developed. It is said that after future consultations are finalized, it will be submitted to Minister Song Ziwen to request the Ministries of Finance and Industry to discuss implementation.</p>

<p>The Three Banks' Authorities Have Not Discussed It</p>
<p>Chen Jian'an Has Not Asked for Instructions</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, it has recently been rumored that the Fujian Provincial Government, with the fiscal year of the 25th year of the Republic beginning on July 1, urgently needs to carry out various undertakings. Therefore, it has borrowed 1.5 million dollars from the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the China Bank, using the province's business tax revenue as collateral. It is also said that Chen Jian'an, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, has telegraphed Lushan to ask President Kong for instructions. Once the reply telegram arrives, it can be determined. A reporter learned from the three banks yesterday that there has been no contact or appointment of anyone to discuss everything in Shanghai as of yesterday. Furthermore, Deputy Governor Chen of the Central Bank has not asked President Kong for instructions. It is assumed to be a misunderstanding from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replies: Measures for Implementing Industry Regulations <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating that it was in response to the Bureau's instruction No. 3038 of the General Office on the fifth of this month, requesting that the various industry guilds be instructed to prepare detailed plans for the implementation of industry regulations and effective handling, for reference. The Chamber stated that the nature of industry regulations is a commercial agreement jointly resolved by members of the same industry, which is no different from a contract jointly entered into by a majority of parties involved in a commercial relationship. In the proposal to discuss and amend the Law on Industry Guilds at the joint meeting of provincial and municipal chambers of commerce on July 20, there was a proposal to add a clause after Article 4 of the current Law on Industry Guilds, stating that industry guilds should, in addition to their articles of association, formulate industry regulations to standardize prices, limit production, and define quality by consensus of the industry. These industry regulations are considered part of the guild's articles of association, and those who violate them may be subject to fines or confiscation of the goods in violation. When necessary, they may also be sued in the competent court and executed in accordance with civil litigation procedures. According to the above proposal, in areas where administrative power is complete, those who violate industry regulations can be subject to administrative penalties, such as fines or confiscation of goods in violation. In special circumstances, such as within the Shanghai Concessions, they can also sue for breach of commercial contract and ask the court to order the violator to compensate for losses. It seems that all situations can be taken care of, and there will be no feeling of difficulty in implementation. It has been resolved that the various chambers of commerce attending the joint meeting will submit the proposal to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industry in the name of the chamber of commerce. This opinion represents the common will of the chambers of commerce in various places and seems to be sufficient to represent the general opinion of the various industry guilds. In response to the previous order, a document is hereby prepared and submitted, requesting the Bureau to review and approve it for implementation, as it is in the public interest.</p>

<p>Please Pay According to Market Price as Usual</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Sample Cocoons Should Be Returned</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Joint Association, located on Avenue Edward VII, Lianzhuli, this port, submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting the return of sample cocoons for trial reeling, stating: "Regarding the request, according to the cocoon merchants who purchased cocoons in the spring period, they have complained to the association that the Cocoon and Silk Control Committee of this term, believing that the cocoon merchants who purchased fresh cocoons did not reach the central price, extracted sample cocoons for trial reeling to determine the quality of the cocoons. According to the merchants' usual practice, these sample cocoons must be compensated at the market price. Now, the Control Committee has taken a considerable number of sample cocoons from the cocoon merchants, and it does not seem appropriate to take people's goods without compensation. Therefore, we request that the sample cocoons and sample silks taken be returned. According to this, it is found that in the market, whether the purchase of dry cocoons is successful or not, the sample cocoons should be priced at the market price. Now, the Cocoon and Silk Control Committee does not price the sample cocoons taken from the cocoon shops at the market price due to the trial reeling, and the sample cocoons should also be returned to ensure fairness and avoid criticism. Based on the previous situation, we hereby submit this request to your government for review and approval to instruct implementation, as it is in the public interest. Sincerely submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government."</p>

<h3 id="e140">Employees of the China Credit Information Bureau Went on Strike Yesterday Morning: Employees Put Forward Demands <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the resignation of Chairman Zhang Naiqi of the China Credit Information Bureau on Yuanmingyuan Road in this port, the board of directors elected Zhu Yangchen as the new chairman. After Chairman Zhu took office, he dismissed three employees, causing a reaction from all colleagues. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, all employees and printing workers suddenly united and declared a strike. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Contents of the Bureau</p>
<p>The bureau was established four years ago and is jointly operated by more than 20 banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. It specializes in credit investigations. It is divided into seven sections: investigation, documentation, information, general affairs, line name, printing, and the secretary's office. Zhang Naiqi served as chairman, and Pan Yangyao served as manager (but Pan has resigned and has not been replaced). There are more than 80 employees and printing workers in the bureau. Through four years of effort, the business has gradually developed, and the finances have become independent. Branch offices have also been added in Hankou and Tianjin. Since Mr. Zhang resigned as chairman last month, the board of directors decided to appoint Zhu Yangchen, director of the Investigation Department of the Bank of China, as chairman to be responsible for all affairs of the bureau.</p>
<p>Cause of the Strike</p>
<p>After Chairman Zhu took office, he transferred Ge Shiliang, the original secretary, to be the director of the Information Department. Zhu Longyi, secretary of the China Credit Association, was appointed to concurrently replace Ge. Li Baimeng, the director of the Information Department, was transferred to be a clerk in the Documentation Department. Three other employees in the Documentation and Investigation Departments were dismissed, causing dissatisfaction among all colleagues. They negotiated with Chairman Zhu. Mr. Zhu admitted that his actions were inappropriate, and Zhang Naiqi also came forward to mediate. However, as of yesterday, because Mr. Zhu still failed to implement the reconciliation plan, all employees, including the printing workers and tea servants, jointly went on strike at 9:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Situation of the Workers</p>
<p>A reporter specially visited the foreman of the printing department yesterday. According to him, the workers of the bureau are required to work from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day, but in reality, the working hours must be extended to 12:00 AM or 1:00 AM to complete the work. The monthly salary is at most 15 yuan, and the meals on Sundays and holidays are paid for by themselves. The work limited each day must complete 50 pages, otherwise a day's salary will be deducted. A few days ago, three or four workers had already left because they could not maintain their livelihoods. There are currently 10 workers in total, and they all feel that the new chairman's treatment is harsh. Therefore, they also sympathize with the employees and take a consistent action.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Chinese Tea Can Be Expected to Dominate the International Market <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Black Tea Exports Account for Two-Fifths</p>
<p>Three Major Reforms as Reasons for Improvement</p>
<p>According to Dagong News, this year's tea trade with foreign countries has greatly increased in price and exports are booming due to major reforms in quality and marketing. Purchases are made by countries such as England, America, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Morocco. Green tea accounts for the majority of exports, with black tea only accounting for two-fifths of green tea, because the demand for black tea is not as widespread as that for green tea. There are three reasons for the sudden improvement in exports: (1) Since China has sought to develop black tea, in addition to implementing unified marketing, the National Economic Council has also jointly established experimental farms with tea merchants in Anhui and Jiangxi to promote scientific roasting methods, and the quality has been improving day by day, surpassing Indian and Ceylon tea. (2) Although countries such as England, Russia, France, and the United States have promoted tea planting, it is difficult to achieve results due to unsuitable land. (3) The production of Indian, Javanese, and Ceylon teas, which compete with Chinese tea in the international market, has sharply decreased in recent years, so Chinese tea has taken advantage of the situation. Therefore, general European and African tea merchants believe that if Chinese tea can strive to improve and not slacken, it can dominate the international tea market in a few years.</p>

The tiger was transported to the park at 6:00 PM and will be open for exhibition today.</p>

In addition to holding exhibitions to expand publicity, it also invited people from all walks of life to hold a publicity conference at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of August 8th, resolving to designate August 8th as the National Goods Cigarette Commemorative Day, in order to awaken compatriots to jointly maintain it. Now that the one-year term of the association is approaching, it held the "August 8th Festival" anniversary yesterday at the Lao Jin Long Restaurant. Attendees included Yuan Ludeng, Shen Weiting, Bao Gengsheng, Jing Yimeng, Wu Linzhi, Sun Daosheng, Wang Junzhi, etc. Mr. Yuan Ludeng chaired the meeting and delivered a commemorative speech on behalf of all the committee members. Next, the meeting discussed association affairs, and finally, a dinner was held before dispersing. The commemorative speech is recorded as follows: "Time flies, and today is another auspicious day for the August 8th anniversary. How delightful! However, in the past year, although the business of domestic cigarettes has been extensively promoted and fully maintained by our association, the business situation has ultimately been subject to environmental control, making it difficult to reverse its decline. This is truly regrettable for the members of our association, but there is nothing we can do. Since recent years, the country's progress has been difficult, the countryside is on the verge of crisis, and the social economy has suffered exhaustion, resulting in a decrease in purchasing power, which has greatly impacted the cigarette business. Moreover, our Chinese factories have only recently emerged, with weak financial resources, working diligently day and night, still fearing to fall behind. On the other hand, foreign cigarette factories have a long history and possess strong forces, watching fiercely and swallowing like whales, rising up to compete, which is a formidable enemy for our Chinese factories. It is difficult to seek maximum development. Recently, due to cigarette smuggling from a certain country, smuggled cigarettes are flooding various places, causing hand-cranked and handmade tax-evading cigarettes to flourish like wildfire, spreading daily and encroaching on the sales figures of cigarette factories, which is alarming. Chinese factories are suffering from these multiple influences, so how can business not decline day by day? This is also what the members of our association lament today. From now on, we earnestly hope that compatriots across the country will uphold their fearless spirit and rise up to promote national goods. Then this August 8th festival will also be commemorated without limit. It will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for our association."</p>
<h3 id="e156">Silk Factory Female Workers Demand Wage Wave <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Female Workers Destroy Silk Factory Property</p>
<p>Gong Da and Hong Chang Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3 pm, more than a hundred female workers from the Hua Shun Silk Factory on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, due to their demands for wages from the factory not being met, swarmed to the nearby Gong Da and Hong Chang two silk factories on Zhongxing Road, coercing them to stop work, and destroying a lot of silk cocoons and objects in the Gong Da and Hong Chang factories. When the incident occurred, the factories immediately used the telephone to invite the Sun Temple Police Station of the Xinzha Branch and the Pengpu Security Corps, etc., to go to suppress it. As a result, Sun Jilong, 56 years old, Wuxi native, living at 6 Maigen Road, and Tang Zicheng, 30 years old, living at 17 Huaji Fang, Huasheng Road, also Wuxi natives, were brought in. According to their statements, the total loss was about five or six hundred yuan. The rest of the words were roughly the same. Female workers Qian Lingdi, 25 years old, Yancheng native, living in a straw shed on Jiaotong Road, and Qian Yao, 53 years old, living at the same address, suffered minor injuries on their faces and heads. It is said that they were injured by the security corps. Security corps members Sun Liangpu, 21 years old, Fenghua native, living at the Qinyi Silk Factory, Dayang Bridge, and Ni Tongzhang, 20 years old, Ningbo native, living at the same address, claimed that they did not hit anyone, and the female workers themselves threw benches at people. Li Tongpei, 30 years old, Changzhou native, living at 1 Mingde Lane, Datong Road, a staff member of the silk reeling workers' union, said that he came out to mediate. Zhu Shourong, 24 years old, Shanghai native, living at 1 Yongchang Lane, Zhongxing Road, the landlord of the silk factory, said that he was also willing to mediate on their behalf, so this case can now be resolved peacefully, and there should not be any major changes. After verifying the confessions, Inspector Yang Chunran has handed them over to the Xinzha Branch for disposal.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Supervisory Committee Member Liu Shengyang's Wife Sues for Invalid Divorce Agreement, Yesterday's Special Second Court Hearing, Liu Shengyang Resolutely Unwilling to Mediate <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Liu Shengyang, also known as Hou Wu, 46 years old, a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong, a current member of the Central Supervisory Committee, residing at 172 Julai Da Road in the French Concession, is now being represented by lawyer Hu Jue by his fellow villager Liu Huang Zhenyuan (age 40), residing at 19 Qingfu Lane, Pushi Road, French Concession, who has filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special Second Court, claiming that although it is different to not accept advance payments for fraud, please mediate. It is claimed that the petitioner married the defendant in Guangdong on September 23rd of the Republic of China Year 7, and was married by Pastor Yang Shoushan. They lived together and had a daughter in Year 16, named Shensheng. Both sides</p>
<p>were very affectionate.</p>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the defendant falsely claimed that he was going to Guangdong for official duties and instructed the petitioner to take 1,500 yuan from his friend Zhang Xingyuan for household expenses. When the petitioner went to Mr. Zhang to get the money, Mr. Zhang said that a receipt must be left. If he was illiterate, he could also leave a fingerprint to be handed over to the defendant as proof (the original illegal divorce certificate was presented to the court during the hearing). Unexpectedly, the defendant went away and never returned, maliciously abandoning the petitioner and placing her in a desperate situation. At that time, the petitioner did not know that the defendant was using deceptive means to divorce, leaving the petitioner and her daughter</p>
<p>to depend on each other for life.</p>
<p>Pawning possessions for a living, year after year, like a crane gone without a trace. Now, he knows that the defendant is a prominent official with many concubines, abandoning the petitioner as old and faded. The petitioner is in this situation, hating not to live. For the sake of her young daughter, abandoned by her father, there is no alternative but to entrust someone to mediate with the defendant, but he ignores it. He was forced to hire a lawyer to send a letter of warning, but the defendant refused with a divorce certificate. The defendant also denied misappropriating the petitioner's</p>
<p>Guangdong Public Bond</p>
<p>prize money of 20,000 yuan in September of the 16th year of the Republic of China, as well as more than 16,000 yuan in household expenses paid by the petitioner over the years, refusing to repay them. The illegal divorce certificate colluded by the defendant with Zhang Xingyuan not only stipulates that a mutual divorce should be in writing, according to the Civil Code, but should also have the testimony of two or more people. In this illegal divorce certificate, Zhang Xingyuan is the defendant's witness, and there are no signatures of two or more people to testify, so it is fundamentally invalid according to law and constitutes the crime of fraud under the Criminal Code. The petitioner has no ability to save herself, in order to maintain</p>
<p>family peace,</p>
<p>she applies for mediation according to law, requesting that the defendant be summoned to court in person, to inform the defendant to return the 20,000 yuan Guangdong public bond prize money and 16,000 yuan household expenses that the petitioner misappropriated, and to confirm that the divorce certificate established by the defendant colluding with Zhang Xingyuan is invalid and should be destroyed, restoring the feelings of husband and wife, etc. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning, Judge Liao Yuan summoned both parties to the Civil Court 4 for mediation. The petitioner Liu Huang Zhenyuan arrived with her agent, lawyer Hu Jue. Because the petitioner's</p>
<p>facts and reasons</p>
<p>were spoken in Cantonese, fearing that it would be difficult for the court to understand, her agent lawyer re-explained the process. The defendant's lawyer Mai replied on his behalf that the petitioner's words were not true and were completely fraudulent. The two parties met in the 14th year of the Republic of China. If they said they met in the 7th year, it was not true. As for the place where the two parties met, it was in the Hong Kong Club. At that time, the defendant was working in the political world. After the two parties met and lived together, the petitioner did not want to live together because the defendant lost his job. The two parties then signed a separation</p>
<p>cohabitation agreement</p>
<p>with lawyer's testimony and photos. At that time, the defendant paid 1,500 yuan in foreign currency for the petitioner's living expenses and the child's upbringing. It has been seven or eight years. The defendant heard that the petitioner had another partner and had children. Now that she knows that the defendant is developing, she has asked a lawyer to send a letter requesting mediation. The defendant simply</p>
<p>cannot admit</p>
<p>that the two parties have already separated in the past. How can there be any possibility of mediation now? It is important to know that the petitioner had previously taken photos with the defendant and the defendant's wife. The petitioner knew that the defendant already had a wife. How could there be a remarriage? He also presented the photos to the court. The judge asked the defendant's lawyer if mediation was possible to avoid trouble. He replied that the defendant's side absolutely could not mediate. The court then announced that mediation was unsuccessful and adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Puji Sanatorium in Beiqiao Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Puji Sanatorium, founded by Lu Bohong, a leader of the Catholic Church in China, in Beiqiao Town, Shanghai, specializes in treating mental and neurological diseases. It is large in scale and well-equipped, and can be hailed as the first in East Asia. It was opened by Mayor Wu in July last year. Up to now, it has achieved excellent results, which have been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. Yesterday, the hospital invited the press to visit, and Vice President Lu Yingen, chief physicians Yuan Junchang and Sun Cuicun, and Mr. Song Zhiyuan and Mr. Lu Wei were invited to host. The following points are described separately:</p>
<p>Hospital Area</p>
<p>The hospital is located in Beiqiao on Hu Min Road. The Hu Min and Song Hu long-distance buses can directly reach the front door. The transportation is convenient. The area is more than one hundred acres in total. The location is quiet. There are 14 wards built, surrounded by large gardens. The light is abundant, and the air is fresh. The hospital has hired many Chinese and foreign experts in mental and neurological diseases to serve as doctors for diagnosis and treatment. Catholic brothers and sisters from France, the the United States and Germany are hired to serve as nurses. The medical skills are excellent, and the care is attentive.</p>
<p>Well-equipped</p>
<p>Each ward is equipped with hot water heaters, sanitary facilities, and electric bells. The wards are divided into first, second, third and fourth classes and can accommodate five or six hundred patients. For diet, there are Chinese and Western kitchens for guests to choose from. The hospital has built its own water plant to supply drinking water. The water quality is clean. The treatment is divided into four types: (1) taking medicine and injections, (2) outdoor sports, (3) electrical treatment, and (4) steam bath, which are administered according to the symptoms of each patient, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>Number of Patients Treated</p>
<p>The address is 150 acres, with 14 wards, a water plant, sanitary equipment, and steel appliances, medical equipment, etc. in each ward, totaling more than 600,000 yuan. Since the hospital opened last year, it has treated 585 men and women. Of the Chinese and foreign patients, 75 men and women have been cured and discharged, 118 men and women have been partially cured, and more than 260 are hospitalized. The founder of the hospital, Lu Bohong, has always been charitable. In addition to charging fees for the first, second, third, and fourth classes as usual, he also charges a small amount for poor patients and provides free treatment. However, there is a fixed quota. It is said that the hospital is still short of more than 200,000 yuan. It is hoped that philanthropists will be generous in their contributions to benefit patients and their families.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Overseas Chinese in the Southern Islands Hope that the Motherland will Improve Exported Alcoholic Beverages <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The various regions of the South Seas, because of their tropical climate and heavy humidity, have a very large demand for alcoholic beverages. In the past, Chinese alcoholic beverages, such as sorghum wine, Wujiapi wine, and medicinal wine, were imported to Penang and various parts of Malaya every year, with a very large sales volume, especially in rubber plantations and mines. Nowadays, the sales of Chinese alcoholic beverages in the Southern Islands are decreasing day by day. The reason is that the sales of foreign alcohol and locally produced beer have increased greatly, almost replacing the position of Chinese alcoholic beverages. Moreover, Malayan beer enjoys special tax preferences, so its price is low and appealing. As a result, even Japanese beer finds it difficult to compete. During the prosperous period of commerce in the Southern Islands fifteen years ago, Chinese alcoholic beverages were not improved, so they failed to develop adequately. As it stands now, Chinese alcoholic beverages only account for 30% of sales in the Southern Islands, while foreign and locally produced beer account for 70%. The biggest reason is that Jinshan Brandy (i.e., products from Australia) competes with sorghum wine, Wujiapi wine, and Guogong medicinal wine. However, the packaging of Chinese wine cannot compete with that of foreign wine, and Jinshan Brandy also enjoys special tax benefits, while costs and transportation are lower than those of Chinese wine, making it even more difficult for Chinese wine to compete. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to expand the sales of Chinese wine in the Southern Islands without seeking improvement. Overseas Chinese in the Southern Islands usually care a lot about the overseas Chinese cause, so they should pay special attention to the future of the liquor industry. After all, the annual sales volume of liquor is huge. If we can try our best to recover it, it will not only consolidate the commercial position of overseas Chinese, but also increase the economic power of overseas Chinese. Its relationship is indeed not superficial.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Accused of Enticement and Abandonment, Verdict: Lin Tianji Not Guilty, Jing Youmei's Testimony of Seduction Moves Her to Tears <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Lin Tianji, a Cantonese and Deputy Director of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank, age 49, residing at No. 24, Model Village, Jiangwan Road, in early August of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], enticed Jing Youmei, a female student from Peiming Girls' Middle School in Huzhou (currently 21 years old), into sexual relations. Subsequently, they rented houses and cohabited at various locations including No. 55, Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road, No. 20, Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road, and No. 83, Shishan Lane, Baoshan Road. On August 2nd of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], a son was born, named Zhongzheng by Lin. Recently, due to Lin's</p>
<p>abandonment of the woman after seduction, Jing was left uncared for. Consequently, Jing Youmei's father, Jing Kegong, hired a lawyer to sue Lin in the First Special District Court for the crimes of enticement and abandonment under Articles 240, Section 1, and 294, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. The court had summoned him several times, but Lin was unable to appear due to a business trip to Siam, and the trial was suspended. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now that Lin has returned to Shanghai, yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Fen opened a criminal court to summon Lin, who appeared with his</p>
<p>defense attorney, Jiang Yiping, to respond to the charges. First, Jing Kegong stated the charges (already reported previously, so omitted). The court immediately inquired about Jing Youmei's age and date of birth. He replied, "My daughter is currently 21 years old, born on September 23rd of the 5th year of the Republic [1916], the year of the Dragon. She is not yet 20 years old." Then, Jing Youmei recounted the process of being seduced by Lin, saying, "My acquaintance with the defendant was through an introduction by my classmate, Shen Xiluo. At the time, he claimed to be unmarried. After I became pregnant, he urged me to</p>
<p>marry him, saying that he could fulfill his promise after I recovered from childbirth. In July of the 23rd year [1934], I returned to my hometown due to my mother's illness, and on August 2nd, I gave birth to a boy at the Huzhou Gospel Hospital, named Zhongzheng by the defendant. Unexpectedly, he has now abandoned me." Jing Youmei burst into tears while testifying, and also felt sick, unable to stand for the testimony. The court allowed her to sit while speaking. When questioned, Lin Tianji stated that his acquaintance with Jing took place in a room at the East Asia Hotel Company. Jing came with a female friend, and they immediately</p>
<p>rented a house to live together. "As for the child born by the plaintiff, I cannot acknowledge it because the plaintiff has many male friends." He presented a letter from Jing Kegong to him as proof, indicating that Jing Kegong was aware of the situation. He also presented two witnesses, He Jinshi and Huang Yushan. The court immediately summoned them. He Jinshi testified about the circumstances of Jing and Lin's acquaintance. Huang Yushan testified that Jing had borrowed 85 yuan from him to make a coat. Later, when he asked her to return the money, she flirted with him. He once saw her with a</p>
<p>young man, walking hand-in-hand. When he asked who it was, she replied that it was her cousin and asked him not to tell Lin Tianji. Observing her behavior, it was similar to that of a prostitute. Jing Youmei claimed that Huang Yushan had previously borrowed 100 yuan from her. There was a conflict when she asked for it back, so he was now falsely accusing her.

<p>The Industrial News Agency reports that the carters' association members Cang Gongwen, Zhu Fengxiang, He Wushan, Xu Zhulin, and others were deprived of their rights and positions by the association for supporting the Chen Huizhang case. They sent a letter to the association questioning them. The association has replied, promising to explain at the next board meeting. The letters from both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>Carters' Letter Criticizes Deprivation of Rights</p>
<p>The carters' association members Cang Gongwen and others, over thirty people, wrote to the Mutual Aid Society, stating, "We, Cang Gongwen and others, felt sympathy for the death of carter Chen Huizhang who was beaten to death by a British sailor. To seek future protection, at 3:30 pm on July 27, at the Western District branch of the Mutual Aid Society, Gongwen and others convened a carter representatives' meeting, which resolved (1) to punish the murderer, (2) to force an apology, (3) to provide compensation, and (4) to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Cang He and others were appointed as representatives to the Chen case support group to request support, not only for the protection of fellow carters but also for the survival of the entire nation. As carters' association members and representatives, discussing matters concerning the interests of carters and national sovereignty at the Western District branch of the Human Carters' Mutual Aid Society, the Mutual Aid Society should express sympathy and assist in the process to fulfill its responsibilities. However, the fact that Gongwen and others convened the meeting is undeniable, and the meaning is just. Unexpectedly, on July 30, the Xin Shen Daily published a correction letter from the Western District Mutual Aid Society, arbitrarily dismissing the facts. We do not know what their intentions are. Gongwen and others are very surprised. Such behavior is a deprivation of the rights and positions of 40,000 carters and their representatives, which is intolerable. Therefore, we are writing to you to explain your intentions, and we demand a reply within three days to clarify the truth and dispel doubts, so as to avoid misunderstandings. We earnestly hope for this."</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society Replies that an Explanation Will Be Provided</p>
<p>After receiving the letter from Cang Gongwen and others, the Carters' Mutual Aid Society immediately replied, promising to explain at the next board meeting. The letter stated, "We acknowledge receipt of your letter to the Shanghai Human Carters' Mutual Aid Society dated August 1. It was immediately forwarded to Mr. Maxi, Chairman of the Board of the Mutual Aid Society. The Chairman replied, 'There are bound to be misunderstandings in the letter, and the meeting procedures were not completed, which is regrettable. This letter has the names of two carter members and one candidate member, and it is necessary to submit it to the Board. A reply will be provided after the next Board meeting.' We hereby reply to your letter and hope you will note this."</p>

<p>Hua, a Chinese detective from the HSBC police station, learned that someone had organized a counterfeit currency ring at No. 66, Sanyi Lane, No. 452, Huasheng Road in East Shanghai, specializing in printing auxiliary coins of 25 cents of the Central Bank, intending to mix them into the market and disrupt finance. He secretly investigated and confirmed the information. Therefore, at 5:10 PM the day before yesterday, he led Chinese detectives Zhang Desheng, Zhao Ziduo, Cao Jiabao, etc. to No. 66, Sanyi Lane, arrested Gu Fugen from Jiangyin, Zhang Tongshen from Hubei, Wang Agen from Changzhou, and other three people, and seized a printing machine and 2,050 Central Bank 25-cent coins that had been printed, and 4,000 that had been printed on one side, and a quantity of printing ink. They brought the people and items to the police station. Under questioning, they learned that these people had colluded with Yan Liangen from Changzhou, the owner of the Jiuda Printing House at No. 141 Caishi Road in the French Concession, to manufacture the counterfeit coins. Yan was responsible for casting all the printing plates, and the profits would be divided equally in the future. Therefore, they worked with detectives from the French Concession police to continue to arrest Yan, searched and found two printing plates, and brought them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and prosecuted them in accordance with Article 195, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for counterfeiting currency.

<p>The 11th Olympic Games</p>
<h3 id="e190">World Games Basketball: Our National Basketball Team Actually Lost to Japan, 19 to 35. The Reason Was Missed Free Throws. The Battle Was Tense; Our Team Was Down by Five Points at Halftime. <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency World Games Special Correspondent Wireless Broadcast Report) The China-Japan basketball game in the World Games was held in Berlin at 6:00 PM on the 7th. Chinese government representatives Dai Chuanxian, Wang Zhengting, Ambassador Cheng Tianfang, and 600-700 Chinese students in Germany all attended to watch. At the same time, dozens of cheerleaders dressed up and entered the arena to cheer. The magnificent sound heard by domestic listeners when the reporter broadcasted was the cheering of our cheerleaders. Because there were a total of 16 competitions yesterday, the game started slightly later than originally scheduled. The game between the two Chinese teams began after the games between Peru and Egypt.</p>
<p>Our Team's Lineup</p>
<p>Each team is only allowed to have seven players on the court. Our formal lineup is: right forward Mu Zuoyun, left forward Wang Hongbin, center Wang Yuzeng, right guard Wang Nanzhen, left guard Li Shaotang, substitutes Shen Yukong and Wang Shixuan. At the time, it was drizzling. The Japanese players were all very short, but the center was half a head taller than ours and wore glasses. Our coach Dong Shouyi was absent due to illness and was replaced by Ma Yuehan and Li Qingan.</p>
<p>We Open the Scoring</p>
<p>We won the right to choose the court. After the start of the game, the Japanese won the jump ball, but it was intercepted by our side. Mu Zuoyun, Wang Hongbin, and Wang Yuzeng made several decisive passes, going straight into enemy territory. Wang Yuzeng raised his hand and shot, but it went past the basket. The Japanese immediately counterattacked, cautiously. In the melee, our side adopted short, quick passes, but the enemy defended strictly. Mu Zuoyun missed two free throws. Li Shaotang and Wang Yuzeng provided support from the rear. Mu Zuoyun darted under the basket and scored a goal, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Briefly Taking the Lead</p>
<p>Riding on the momentum of victory, Mu Zuoyun again probed the enemy's defense and missed two more free throws. As the opportunity passed, the enemy cavalry invaded. Our five players defended strictly. Soon, Wang Nanzhen fouled, and the opponent made two free throws, making it 2-2. Then Wang Hongbin fouled again, and the enemy scored two more free throws. Wang Hongbin and Wang Nanzhen tried hard to shoot, but were unsuccessful. The competition between the two sides was quite fierce. Li Shaotang fouled, and we were penalized another point. The Japanese led 5-2. Wang Yuzeng changed his style and tried a long shot, but was unsuccessful. Wang Hongbin tried his best to grab the ball and fell several times. Mu Zuoyun was extremely sharp and scored another goal, making it 4-5. Li Shaotang and Wang Nanzhen were eager to score, but several shots were missed. Wang Hongbin scored a goal, and we took the lead 6-5.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Missing Free Throws</p>
<p>After that, the Japanese made all their free throws, taking the lead 9-6 and 11-6. Our passing attacks were frequent, but it was difficult to find an opportunity to shoot. And fate was not on our side. Wang Yuzeng's long shot went into the basket and then came out. Whenever there was a free throw opportunity, it was always missed. The enemy took advantage of the victory and repeatedly attacked under the basket, scoring two consecutive goals. Wang Hongbin occasionally got a good opportunity and flew in. Mu Zuoyun also tossed in a goal, and Wang Yuzeng added the finishing touch, throwing in another goal with one hand, making it 10-15. The first half ended with us down by five points. Statistically, we missed all 15 free throws.</p>
<p>Shaotang Fouled Out</p>
<p>After switching sides, both teams used their original lineups. At that time, the rain gradually increased. We got the first free throw opportunity but missed. And when our side fouled, the enemy scored every time. Mu and Wang, the two forwards, showed their skillful teamwork. Wang Hongbin scored, making it 12-16. At this time, Li Shaotang was fouled out for the fourth time and was replaced by Wang Shixuan. The competition was fierce. The enemy's defense was very good. We launched continuous attacks, but all shots and free throws were missed. The Japanese asked for a timeout and brought in a defender. The intensity of the game remained high. Our Mu Zuoyun left the court and was replaced by Shen Yukong. The situation did not improve. Before long, the captain and center of the opposing team was fouled out for the fourth time. Wang Yuzeng made a free throw, opening the scoring record for our team's free throws.</p>
<p>Disorganized Lineup</p>
<p>Although we tried hard to attack, we were unable to succeed. The lineup gradually became disorganized. After the Japanese gained possession of the ball, they either made short passes that did not go in to delay time, or took advantage of opportunities to sneak in. Their right forward was short and lively, and scored the most points. Our side suffered repeated defeats with scores of 15-22, 15-26, and 15-28. Although Shen Yukong made some progress, it did not help the overall situation. The enemy's movements became more lively, especially their free throws were very accurate. In the end, we lost with a score of 19 to 35. The competition adopted a double round-robin format. We still have one more chance. We hope the team members will work hard.

<p>(Berlin) The China vs. England football elimination match in the World Games was held at 5:00 PM on the 6th. Our defense was very strong, but Li Huitang was too closely guarded by the opponent, making it difficult to move, so the attack was weakened. They fought hard in the first half, but neither side scored. In the second half, our team's strength declined slightly. In the 11th minute, the enemy's center forward shot hard from the ten-yard area, and Bao Jiaping was unable to save it, so they lost a goal. Our team then tried hard to counterattack, but to no avail. In the 21st minute, the opponent again crowded in front of the goal and shot in another goal. After that, neither side scored, and our country was eliminated with a score of 0-2. There were more than 10,000 spectators that day, and they were all extremely impressed by the excellent skills of our football team. Our country's lineup is as follows: (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Ye Beihua Sun Jinshun Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 6th - There were more than 8,000 spectators at the China-England football match. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang was also present to watch. The English team lacked practice and cooperation. The Chinese team made several fierce charges, but all ended in failure. Afterwards, the Chinese players changed to intricate small passes to advance, but this method also failed due to the speed and strictness of the English team's defense. The highlight of this game was the Chinese players' excellent heading, indicating that the Chinese players had adopted this method. In the first half, neither team scored. In the 55th minute of the second half, England's North Stockford passed the ball and scored the first goal. In the 63rd minute, Finn made a wonderful shot, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 6th - The Chinese football team was eliminated by England today with a result of 2-0. The competition was fierce in the first half. The English team first scored a twelve-yard penalty in the second half and then scored another goal. The Chinese team performed very well. Goalkeeper Bao Jiaping was careful and meticulous, and saved many dangerous shots.</p>

<p>(Guomin Huitong News Agency) Berlin, August 6th - The Chinese football team met the strong English team in the preliminary round today, and finally lost to England 2-0. Although the Chinese football team failed to defeat England, most spectators regretted China's unfortunate draw, because the Chinese team's performance this time was truly top-notch. If they had not met the English team, the Chinese team could have at least entered the second week of competition. In the first half, the Chinese players were unusually agile and their defense was unusually meticulous. Therefore, the English team failed to score a goal at halftime. The Chinese team made several decisive headers, winning great applause from the audience. Those who attended the game included Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang, Chinese Team Leader Wang Zhengting, and Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan of the National Government. In addition, there were many Chinese and British expatriates. In the second half, England's center forward Dodd shot in a goal ten minutes after the kickoff. Twelve minutes later, the left winger shot in another goal. Several European football experts who attended the game said that if the Chinese team had been a little luckier, they could have scored at least one goal in this game.</p>
<h3 id="e198">One Step Away, There's Nothing That Can Be Done <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Special Correspondent Berlin Wireless Report - Our country's football team lost to England 2-0 and was eliminated, which is very regrettable. The reason for the failure was not technical backwardness, but insufficient strength. There were more than 10,000 spectators at the game. Our country's government representatives, Examination Yuan President Dai Jitao, Ambassador Cheng, and many Chinese students in Germany all went to watch. Our Chinese students also organized a cheering squad to cheer. Our team performed very well. Goalkeeper Bao Jiaping and defenders Tan Jiangbai and Li Tiansheng guarded the rear firmly, making great contributions. The midfielders Chen Zhenhe and Xu Yahui responded to each other, attacking and defending, and were quite brave. The forwards were led by Li Huitang as the center forward. The English knew that Li was the main player of our football team and guarded him closely, so he could not display his strengths. As a result, the whole team lacked vitality. The right inside forward Feng Jingxiang played very flexibly, the left inside forward Sun Jinshun had skillful footwork, and the right winger Cao Guicheng and the left winger Ye Beihua were relatively weaker. Looking at the overall situation, our country mostly used short passes when attacking, which slowed down the advance, making it easier for the enemy to deploy their defense. And the running was slightly slower, and the kicked balls lacked strength. This was the main reason for the failure. In the end, there was nothing that could be done because of being one step away. Our team has tried its best.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Only Losing Two Goals, Still Have Some Face <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The advantage of their team was that their running and movements were fast and agile, and their kicks were quick and powerful. In the first half, both sides fought hard, our defenders defended the rear to the death, preventing the enemy from succeeding. After 45 minutes of hard fighting, the score was 0-0, a draw. In the second half, they took advantage of the opportunity to attack fiercely, using their strength and endurance to push straight into our territory. The defenders could not return in time to save, and they lost a goal. In the 20th minute, the enemy again sneaked in, and Bao Jiaping could not save it, losing the second goal. Our team had broken into the enemy's line several times, but because of slow footwork or lack of attention in passing the ball, they failed to score. It is said that the British Emperor had sent a telegram to the athletes of that country, instructing them to maintain the glory of England, so the team played very hard during the game.</p>
<p>A total of 16 teams participated in the football tournament. Eight countries have already won the right to the finals. The results were England won over China 2-0, Germany won over Luxembourg 9-0, Italy won over the United States 1-0, Norway won over Turkey 4-0, Japan won over Sweden 3-2, Austria won over Egypt 3-1, Poland won over Hungary 3-0, Peru won over Finland 7-3.</p>

<p>National Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Today is the fifth day of the World Games and also one of the most glorious days in sports history, because the World Games achieved more today than on any other day. Outstanding records were abundant. Two world records and one equaled world record were set in one day, and a World Games record was established. It can be called one of the most glorious days in sports history without a hint of exaggeration. The crown of Olympic glory was divided among five countries: the United States, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, and Germany. Each country won a gold medal in track and field today. However, among these sports, the most touching and exciting for the audience was the 1,500-meter race.</p>
<p>The best middle-distance runners in the world gathered together, and the competition was the fiercest ever seen at the World Games. New Zealander Lovelock's overtaking</p>
<p>American athlete Cunningham was no fluke. Lovelock's efforts in the last week were truly astonishing to the audience. As a result, he set a world</p>
<p>record. (Berlin, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e214">Accompanying Notes of the World Games Delegation (Letter 6-1) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>On the way to Cairo</p>
<p>From Massawa to Port Said, there are a total of 960 nautical miles. In between, we must pass through the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal starts from Port Said in the north and ends at Suez in the south, with a total length of 87 miles (some say 104 miles). It is a man-made canal connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. In other words, it is a vital passage connecting the shipping routes of Europe and Asia. The postal ship stops for one hour at Suez. Passengers can either stay on the ship and admire the scenery along the canal, one of the seven great projects in the world, or disembark at Suez, take a car to visit Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the birthplace of Western civilization, and then take a car from Cairo to Port Said to catch up with the original ship. You can have both the fish and the bear's paw, as you wish.</p>
<p>The day before arriving at Suez, the ship initiated the formation of groups to visit Cairo. There were two groups in total, one initiated by Thomas Cook &amp; Son, and the other initiated by China Travel Service. The latter's tour fee was 6 pounds for first class and 5 pounds for first class, while the former was half a pound more expensive. As a reporter from the ancient country that is the ancestor of Eastern civilization, I have long admired Egypt, the birthplace of Western civilization. Especially when I read geography as a child, the pyramids and Sphinx in my mind left a deep impression, and I felt it was necessary to go and admire them. So, I signed up to join the China Travel Service group, with a total of 40 people. On the athlete delegation side, only the three ladies of the sports inspection group, Huang Liming, Chen Yongsheng, and Du Yufei, Mr. Mao Yixin of the Shishi Xinbao, and the reporter, a total of five people, participated. The rest were members of the European sightseeing tour group. The Thomas Cook &amp; Son group also had 30 participants, all of whom were Europeans and Indians.</p>
<p>At midnight on the 16th, the postal ship arrived at Suez and docked outside the entrance of the canal. Looking into the distance, many ships were anchored in the canal, with brilliant lights illuminating the clear water. A gust of cool breeze was blowing, exceptionally refreshing. After escaping the hot currents of the Red Sea, everyone was extremely excited to see this scenery. After checking passports, we disembarked from the ship at 1:30 AM on the 17th and boarded a speedboat to land. The travel agency had previously invited a special guide in Egypt to lead the way. At 2:30 AM, we departed from Suez in eight cars, some with six people per car, and some with four people per car, which was quite comfortable.</p>
<p>From Suez to Cairo, there are a total of 150 miles, with a highway connecting them. This highway is entirely built in the desert, and the project is extremely difficult. The first half has not yet been completed, and it is rugged and uneven. The second half has been paved with asphalt, as flat as the roads in big cities. The desert climate at night is somewhat chilly. We traveled under the stars and moon, advancing in a mighty manner. All we saw was yellow sand everywhere, desolate and desolate. Fortunately, there were many travel companions, so there was no loneliness.</p>
<p>The five people in the same car as the reporter were all members of the sightseeing tour group. One person sat next to the driver. The reporter and another person sat in the front row of the car, and the other three sat in the back row. Relatively speaking, the most comfortable was sitting in the back row. When the car had traveled halfway, it stopped for a rest. When continuing forward, the gentleman sitting in the front row silently sat in the back row. As a result, he had a big argument with one of the people originally sitting there. One said that you should obey the rules and stay in your original seat, and the other said that everyone paid the same amount of money and should take turns sitting. The two sides were fierce and seemed about to fight. In the end, the driver mediated and everyone stayed in their original seats. However, the car broke down less than five minutes after starting again. Everyone had no choice but to squeeze into other cars. These two gentlemen who sought comfort also silently endured the same grievance. This humorous scene, although a very small dispute, fully demonstrated the inferior nature of the Chinese people fighting for power and profit, and not stopping until both sides are hurt. This inferior nature can be said to be the root cause of why Chinese politics cannot get on the right track and society is always disordered. If it cannot be eradicated, the country and society will never have a solution. Perhaps readers will not blame me for being too trivial for wasting ink to write this passage.</p>
<p>Enough with the digression, let's get back to the topic. At 5:00 AM on the 17th, we arrived in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the birthplace of Western culture, one after another. Because the scheduled sightseeing time was only five hours, after gathering in the suburbs, we passed through Cairo and first went to admire the pyramids and the Sphinx.</p>
<p>Cairo and the Pyramids</p>
<p>Cairo, on the surface, does not look like the quaint ancient capital we imagine, but a completely modern metropolis. The entire city is full of tall Western-style buildings five or six stories high. The outer layers of all the buildings are covered with yellow, which is extremely harmonious and symmetrical with the color of the desert. The streets are very wide and flat, but not very clean. There are extremely many flies, flying everywhere, which makes people unbearable. If we want to find a bit of ancient charm on the surface of Cairo, it is probably only the veils of the women. The women's clothes are all black, and the veils are also made of black gauze, hanging down to the chest, exposing only the eyes. This unique custom of the Hui religion has been maintained and has not yet been eliminated. However, a few modern women have also shown their faces and are not ashamed of not wearing veils.</p>
<p>The pyramids are built on sand dunes, about miles away from the city of Cairo. In the light, we went around Cairo and crossed the bridge spanning the Nile River. Before long, we arrived at the bottom of the pyramids. Colored clouds floated in the sky, reflecting on the desert, showing the color of gold. The first impression the pyramids gave us was very beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>A paved road has been built from the bottom of the sand dunes to the pyramids, and cars can go directly there. However, traveling to the desert should be a taste of camels. So, everyone got out of the car and switched to riding camels. When the camels kneel on the ground, when people ride on them, they first raise their front legs halfway, then raise their hind legs, and finally straighten their front legs. This three-part movement, carried out one after the other, causes the person riding on it to be thrown back and forth, extremely frightened. Several female travel companions screamed in horror.</p>
<p>The so-called pyramids are the tombs of ancient Egyptian emperors. There are a total of 75 in Egypt, and nine in Cairo. Six of them are smaller, and the other three are very great projects, known as one of the seven great projects in the world. The largest one is called Cheops, the second is called Chephren, and the third is called Menkaure, all of which are the names of emperors.</p>
<p>Cheops was built in 2619 BC, and it has been 4,550 years since then. Chephren is about 50 years apart, and Menkaure is another 50 years apart. It is said that ancient Egyptian emperors enslaved their subjects during their lifetimes to build tombs for them. It took decades to complete the project, and he would die and be buried in the tomb. The next generation of emperors took over and started building again. This continued endlessly, and the people of ancient Egypt had to build tombs for their emperors forever, wasting money and labor, just for the tomb after one person's death. The despotism and ruthlessness of ancient Egyptian emperors can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>Cheops is the largest pyramid in all of Egypt. The construction time lasted a total of 30 years. Ten years were spent on quarrying, because Cairo does not produce stones, and they must be quarried from distant mountains and transported. The remaining 20 years were spent on construction. The labor used totaled 4 million people. The tower is 451 feet high, and the base is square, with each side also 451 feet. The stones used each weigh two or three tons, and they are stacked layer by layer, forming a pointed top. The four corners face the four directions of east, south, west, and north. It has been more than 4,500 years since then, and it has not changed at all. Many modern architectural engineers who have seen it are surprised and do not know what methods the ancient architects used to quarry so many neat stones, how they transported them to Cairo, how they moved them up one by one, and even more, how they used them to build this great building on the desert, which can remain unchanged for four or five thousand years. According to our guide, this pyramid used more than 2 million stones, totaling 7 million cubic feet. If these many stones were used to build a two-yard high city wall, it could surround all of France. The scale of the project can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Because everyone was in a hurry, they only looked at it from the outside, and then went to see the Sphinx. The reporter felt that if he arrived in front of this great ancient site without going inside to explore, it would be a lifelong regret. So, on the way back, he got off the camel alone and walked quickly forward. A door as tall as a person was opened on the northeast side of the tower, and two or three locals were guarding there. Walking in, there were winding corridors. Electric lights were installed inside, illuminating it very clearly. This corridor was thirty or forty steps long, and at the end, there were winding stone steps. According to the guards, the emperor's golden coffin was hidden on top of the tower, and it would take ten minutes to walk up. Because time was short, I had to give up in disappointment. Although the reporter regretted not being able to see the golden coffin, everyone felt that the complexity of the structure inside the tower made them feel the difficulty of the project and the ingenuity of the craftsmen even more.</p>
<p>The Sphinx faces the Pyramid of Chephren and is located below the sand dunes. It is said that this monster is 6,000 years old, but archaeologists believe that it was built at the same time as the Pyramid of Chephren, because the appearance of this "monster" is very similar to the stone statue of Chephren hidden in the museum. It is said that the intention of building this monster was to increase the solemnity of the royal tomb, which has the same meaning as the stone elephants and stone horses in front of the tombs of our ancient emperors. The human face symbolizes peace, and the lion's body symbolizes power, representing the character and authority of ancient emperors. This Sphinx is 60 feet high and 210 feet long. It is also made of many tons of rocks stacked and carved. Looking at it from the front, it is completely a human figure. On both sides of the head, there are triangular hairs. The eyes are carved very deeply, and they are shining. Because of the sun and wind for thousands of years, the nose has collapsed, making it look very ugly. Two giant legs extend from the bottom of the body, and the traces are not very clear. Standing next to it, it is completely in the shape of a giant lion. The art of ancient Egypt is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>On the right side of the Sphinx, there is also an ancient temple, which is said to have been built by King Chephren. Because time was short, there was no time to go inside to see it. After the entire team of travelers took photos on camels as souvenirs, they went down to a nearby hotel for breakfast. After the meal, they drove to visit an ancient royal palace and a museum.</p>

<h3 id="e215">All National Secondary Schools and Civic Education Halls Must Install Radios - The Ministry of Education Orders All Education Bureaus to Comply <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The Ministry of Education believes that all national secondary schools must install radios by December of this year, and civic education halls must install them by June of next year. The deadline is not far away. On the 7th, it specially ordered all education bureaus to urge those who have not yet installed them to install them as soon as possible, and to list all schools and halls under their jurisdiction, whether they have been installed or not, and submit them for review within two weeks of receiving the document. Furthermore, all provinces and cities should pay attention to rural areas when installing radios in the future, so as to ensure that the distribution is even throughout the territory. All primary schools and civic schools in rural areas, regardless of size, should also be urged to install them as soon as possible. All education bureaus should be responsible for raising funds for subsidies for purchasing radios. However, the Ministry of Education will still provide subsidies for border provinces and impoverished areas as appropriate. The measures will be notified after the Ministry has comprehensively reviewed and approved the installation situation reported by each province and city this year, and the Ministry will also order each education bureau to formulate its own fundraising and radio purchase measures and submit them promptly.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Measures for Admission and Transfer of Northeastern Elementary School Students <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education, previously, because students who graduated or studied at elementary schools in the Northeast and entered the customs to study were often rejected by various schools due to non-compliance with the certificates they held, which affected their studies. This was not insignificant. Therefore, interim measures for the admission and transfer of northeastern elementary school students were drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Education to order the education bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct their subordinates to comply. The method is that those holding elementary school graduation certificates from various provinces and cities in the Northeast after September 18th to apply for junior high school, or the aforementioned study certificates to request insertion into the corresponding grade of elementary school, should be allowed to apply with the certificates they hold. If admitted, the school admitting the student should fill out the northeastern elementary school student academic form according to the format prescribed by the office, and send it to the office together with the original application certificate. The office will then issue a certificate based on the reported academic qualifications and reference to the original certificate, so that the school can report it according to regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Questions and Answers Regarding Various Aspects of Nocturnal Emission and Treatment Methods <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Yao Yunping, Answered by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan.)</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My nocturnal emission problem is getting worse and worse. Sometimes I have emissions every day – continuously for more than ten days; and I'm still asleep when it happens, and I'm already finished when I wake up; I've always had emissions without dreaming. During the day, I feel dizzy and almost completely unable to work on brain-intensive and eye-intensive tasks such as reading and writing. Also, I often feel chills and catch colds very easily. I've taken a lot of Chinese and Western medicine, but it doesn't seem to work. I saw in the "New Medical Journal" that "Hymexal Anti-Emission Tablets" and "Reproduction Hormone" are specifically for treating this disease; they are very effective. Last month, I bought and took a box of each from Wing On Company to try, and I felt that the frequency of nocturnal emission has decreased a lot, and the degree of dizziness has also felt much alleviated. Now I have a few more questions to ask you presumptuously, hoping you will sacrifice some time and energy to teach me immediately. Sorry for the trouble, thank you, looking forward to it... That's all I want to say to you. The questions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Can "Hymexal Anti-Emission Tablets" and "Reproduction Hormone" fundamentally solve the nocturnal emission problem? In other words, will it never recur after taking this medicine?</p>
<p>(Answer) "Hymexal Anti-Emission Tablets" is a famous emission-stopping drug, while "Reproduction Hormone" is a preparation made from the endocrine elements of the testes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. Therefore, it is a specific drug for fundamentally solving nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>(2) I have already taken a box and it has been effective. I wonder how many more boxes I need to take to be completely cured?</p>
<p>(Answer) About five or six boxes.</p>
<p>(3) Can living with a woman cure nocturnal emission? Will it make the disease worse?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is best not to sleep together, and to restrain your desires. You must be completely cured before having sexual intercourse.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Famous Medicine for Premature Ejaculation Cures Seminal Emission and Revitalizes Life <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lu: Suffering from seminal emission for two years, tried nine kinds of medicine, but the effect was lacking, and it was difficult to cure completely. Performance and life were both damaged. Premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy were frequently seen to increase. Later, he was introduced to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for electrotherapy, and was instructed to purchase "Antirrhea," a holy medicine for seminal emission, from Tai Wo Pharmacy to completely cure his seminal emission. He mainly used the famous medicine "Reproduction Hormone" to save his premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and other sexual diseases. Within a month, the effect was greatly significant. Within forty days, his hidden diseases and sexual diseases were completely cured.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Safe Smoking Cessation in Less Than a Month <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Chen: Had been addicted for a long time, and the amount was also very heavy. He had repeatedly tried to quit, but stopped halfway due to the emergence of ailments. He could not be cured, and he could not quit. His spirit was depressed, and his body and mind were in pain. Last month, he was introduced by Mr. Lu, who had safely quit smoking and completely cured his stomach disease with "Wei Tong Ling" and "Reproduction Hormone," for treatment. He was instructed to purchase "Reproduction Hormone" from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy to nourish his body while quitting smoking, and "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat his long-standing gout. Within a month, he reported quitting smoking. The reason why the quitting period was shortened was that he was also injected with "Yu Wei Ci Bao Ming" at the time, which was also very effective.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Numb Limbs and Sore Muscles <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>There are many variations of bone pain syndromes. Numb limbs and sore muscles are common. The method of treatment lies in removing the root cause of the pain, numbness, and soreness – uric acid crystals. These crystals are shaped like broken glass shards. When they enter the muscles, they cause muscle soreness; when they enter the limbs, they cause limb numbness; and when they enter the bones, they cause bone pain. The use of medicine should focus on dispelling wind, removing toxins, dissolving acid, and reducing inflammation, so that it can be completely cured. The famous medicine "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" is truly a holy product among bone pain medicines. It can achieve the most satisfactory therapeutic effect for mild to severe, long-standing bone pain and its syndromes.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Neurasthenia, Premature Aging <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The nervous system is distributed throughout the body. The feeling of sensation and the operation of movement are all commanded by the nerves. Therefore, the relationship between nerves and us is extremely important and huge. However, the health of the nerves depends on whether their nutrition is good or not, and the source of nerve nutrition depends on the reproductive hormone – endocrine. If the reproductive hormone is lacking, the nerves lose nutrition, forming weakness, and various symptoms of weakness arise, with premature aging being the most obvious. The patient has back pain, pale face, and mental weakness, losing his health and showing signs of decline early. The treatment method with "Reproduction Hormone" is the most effective. For example, recently, a patient, Mr. Ni, complained of premature aging and fear of labor and annoyance. After purchasing "Reproduction Hormone" from the Sino-British Pharmacy, the nerves immediately became prosperous, returning to the youth of the past, with strength in the waist and back, and full of vitality.</p>
<p>Post-Illness Disharmony</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhao: Suffered from a seasonal epidemic in early summer, and its momentum was very fierce. Fortunately, he was cured in the hospital, but because his vitality was greatly damaged, he could not recover for a while. He took "Reproduction Hormone" to regulate his sick body and restore his health after being introduced by a German doctor. After taking three boxes in a row, he became incomparably strong and healthy.</p>
<p>Prolonged Infertility</p>
<p>Patients Mr. and Mrs. Zheng: Married for sixteen or seventeen years. Until now, they have not had a single child. Because they saw their neighbor Mr. Ge having a son after taking "Reproduction Hormone," they also purchased it from the Sino-French Pharmacy. From spring until now, his wife is now pregnant.</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Co-edited by Dr. Zhan Nianceng and Dr. Yao Erchang</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM (Closed on Sundays)</p>
<p>The rampancy of sexually transmitted diseases progresses with the civilization of the city. In other words, the more civilized the city, the more rampant the sexually transmitted diseases. According to the classification of sexually transmitted diseases, there are infectious and non-infectious types. Infectious types include syphilis, seminal emission, inguinal bubo, chancroid, etc. Non-infectious types include nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and sexual weaving, etc. Since the syndromes are different, the treatment methods are also different. All our patients, if it is inconvenient to consult a doctor, or it is impossible to purchase medicine, can send a letter to ask about the illness, or refer to the treatment methods described in this lecture to secretly treat themselves according to the law, which is also possible.</p>
<p>Complete Cure for Seminal Emission</p>
<p>The source of this disease is caused by infection with gonococci. Gonococci are fierce and entrenched in the mucous membranes of the reproductive and urinary organs, using them as protective charms to wreak havoc. Ordinary inferior medicines do not understand the importance of membrane penetration and sterilization, and do not understand the principle, so there are those who falsely claim that membrane penetration is unnecessary, which is ridiculed by knowledgeable people. Once misused, it is not only ineffective, but also misdirects the pathogenesis. When the virus spreads throughout the body and dangerous syndromes emerge in abundance, treatment becomes more difficult and time-consuming. The effective treatment method should focus on both membrane penetration and sterilization and increasing anti-gonococcal power. It is as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn to seek a medicine on the market that has both of these two effects. Of these, the most effective is "Antirrhea" invented by German medical doctor Jadassohn. It can achieve very good results for acute and chronic gonorrhea, concurrent dangerous syndromes, and gynecological leukorrhea and uterine inflammation, etc. For example: Last month, a patient, Mr. Xu, suffered from gonorrhea for many years and the treatment was not thorough. It recurred again and again, making him feel embarrassed and difficult. After purchasing "Antirrhea" from Wing On Company, the gonorrhea stopped, the emission stopped, the urine became clear, and the inflammation subsided. After taking it continuously for three weeks, the disease he suffered was suddenly lost, and it has never recurred.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Breast Atrophy</p>
<p>This journal has discussed the importance of reproductive glands in the human body in detail. If the reproductive glands atrophy or reproductive hormones are lacking, men will experience symptoms such as kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, while women will experience symptoms such as irregular menstruation, leukorrhea, and breast atrophy. These are also very much related to health, beauty, youth, and longevity. The treatment method naturally focuses on taking "Reproduction Hormone" internally. Ms. Lü's beautiful posture in the past was due to Mr. Lü contracting a malignant disease, which led to leukorrhea, abdominal pain, breast atrophy, and weakness. After taking "Antirrhea" internally and using "Leukorrhea Ling" externally, the malignant leukorrhea was cured at the same time. However, her body and breasts could not recover for a while, so she took "Female Reproduction Hormone." Within two months, her body quickly recovered its health, and her breasts redeveloped.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission Saved</p>
<p>Masturbation is an inevitable bad habit for young people, and it has become an open secret. Therefore, nocturnal emission has also become a common disease among young people. Patients have yellow faces and thin muscles, depleted blood, and weak spirits. Insomnia and forgetfulness arise, and symptoms of decline and disease swarm. The method of treatment should first be to strengthen the sperm barrier and then replenish the reproductive glands in order to completely cure it. For example: In early summer, a patient, Mr. Wang, was suffering from frequent nocturnal emission, and was exhausted. He purchased "Hymexal Anti-Emission Tablets" from the Five Continents Pharmacy to strengthen his sperm barrier, and took "Reproduction Hormone" to replenish his damaged reproductive glands. The sperm barrier was strengthened, and the nocturnal emission was also cured. Now, he has sufficient essence and strong spirit, thick blood and strong muscles, regaining development and returning to health, as if reborn.</p>
<p>Common Sense for Self-Treatment</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Touchstone of Bone Pain Medicine <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>The patient is from Nanjing, 47 years old, surnamed Zhang. He began to feel back pain at the age of 40. His occupation is an editor for a newspaper. He rarely exercises, and works every night until 3:00 AM the next morning. Due to accumulated labor, he often feels back pain. At first, the illness was mild, and it only broke out slightly after finishing work. After three years, it gradually became severe. Not only did he feel pain all the time, but the joints and both shoulders and arms felt as if they had been hit. He could not lift them high when in pain, but fortunately, it did not break out all the time. However, during the change of seasons, the pain was slightly worse, and he could not even write. Sometimes it even lasted for three or four months. At that time, he constantly tried various medicines for bone pain. After taking them, he felt slightly relieved, but it was never completely cured. In the past three years, also because of increasing age and weakened resistance, the illness has also worsened. The degree of joint soreness is like being pricked with needles, and with numbness. He immediately wore thick cotton clothes when it got slightly cold. In winter, he had to wear very thick silk cotton coats and pants, fearing the cold. At the end of last autumn, he even suffered from hemiplegia, and his hands and feet lost their autonomy. Then, introduced by a friend, he took "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" for more than three weeks continuously. The situation changed drastically. All the symptoms of back pain were completely cured. Therefore, it did not recur in winter last year. Although he has been engrossed in work recently, and sweating profusely, he does not feel any pain either. The above situation is indeed a good mirror for bone pain sufferers. Therefore, it is recorded specifically for the reference of patients.</p>
<p>Famous Medicine Experiment</p>
<p>Breast Atrophy and Weak Body</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Lu: From Wujiang, 34 years old, inherently weak and undeveloped. Although her physique is beautiful, it is difficult to express. She was known as the "Sick Xishi" when she was in school, which can be known. After purchasing "Female Reproduction Hormone" from Tai Wo Pharmacy, her body immediately became healthy, her muscles developed, and her breasts were tall and full, fully expressing her healthy and beautiful posture. Old classmates and sisters have changed their tune and call her Sai Xishi.</p>
<p>Masturbation Remedy</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tang: Suffered from severe masturbation when he was young, which greatly depleted his spirit and blood. Nocturnal emission occurred frequently, and insomnia appeared continuously. Repeated replenishment was ineffective. After purchasing "Hymexal Anti-Emission Tablets," the holy medicine for nocturnal emission, from the Five Continents Pharmacy, the nocturnal emission was immediately cured. He also took "Reproduction Hormone" to replenish his essence and blood. After taking half a dozen, he regained his health and strength, as if reborn.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain and Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Li: Addicted to smoking due to stomach pain for ten years. He could not be cured, and he could not quit. He was extremely troubled, and grief and worry were intertwined. After purchasing "Wei Tong Ling" from the Sino-British Pharmacy to remove the cause of his pain, and taking "Jian Wei Su" to replenish his sick stomach, the stomach pain was completely cured. He also used the holy medicine "Reproduction Hormone" for cultivating and replenishing to quit smoking to remove the toxins and quit his smoking addiction. Within a month, the ten-year addiction was completely gone, as if coming out of fire and water and ascending to a comfortable seat.</p>
<p>Seminal Emission and Bone Pain</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang: Infected with gonorrhea for two years, treated more than once. It recurred after being cured, making it difficult to completely cure. He felt bone pain even more at the end of winter, and medical treatment was ineffective. The pain increased. After purchasing "Antirrhea" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to treat chronic gonorrhea, and taking "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat gonococcal bone pain, the pain disappeared, and the gonorrhea was also cured. It has been half a year since then, and it has never recurred.</p>
<p>Irregular Menstruation</p>
<p>Patient Ms. Wu: She always felt abdominal pain during menstruation. Her periods were inaccurate, and the menstruation was dripping incessantly, mixed with leukorrhea, either dripping or flooding, making it unbearable. Her body suffered greatly, and she was thin and pale. Her breasts also atrophied, losing their health and beauty. After purchasing "Female Reproduction Hormone" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Ling" for external use from Huamei Pharmacy to regulate menstruation and treat leukorrhea, the menstruation was adjusted, and the leukorrhea also stopped. Her body quickly regained its health, and her breasts reappeared plump.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Relationship Between Development, Health, and Longevity <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>……Humans must go through perfect development—— capable of not dying young ……Incomplete development will affect sexual pleasure——must quickly plan for remedies ……Should cultivate strong and healthy reproductive glands——to extend life</p>
<p>The scope of development is quite broad, and the most important is the sexual organs. Small sexual organs are an important symptom of incomplete development. The causes can be divided into congenital and acquired. Congenital causes are due to sexual organ deformities, or diseases and abnormalities in various endocrine glands (such as the pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, thymus gland, adrenal gland, and reproductive glands) during the development period, which hinders the development of the sexual organs.</p>
<p>Acquired causes are mainly due to disorders in the testicular reproductive glands. In addition, the unrestrained and unlimited abuse of sexual organs, especially the act of self-pollution in childhood, can most hinder development and make the sexual organs small. In addition, phimosis also has a tendency to resist development, and can be removed by a specialist physician through surgery. (Editor's note: Excision of the foreskin can be done by Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a sexually transmitted disease expert, who guarantees no pain, skillful surgery, and rich experience.)</p>
<p>Other developmental aspects related to women include the absence of menstruation even at the age of maturity, lack of curves, hard and small breasts, sparse pubic hair, and weak development like a child.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is also incomplete physical development, short stature, insufficient energy, thin and soft bones, forming a sickly and troubled appearance. If such people do not pay attention to the methods of development, or let it evolve naturally, or even disregard it completely and get married rashly, not only is there a danger of a short life, but it will inevitably lead to the pain of sexual life. Even if women get married, they have no ability to conceive. Men will inevitably suffer from weak yang, atrophy of the penis, and all neurasthenia symptoms will inevitably erupt one after another, such as tinnitus, headache, palpitations, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Think about it, will the life of such a person be like a rudderless boat, insecure from morning to night?</p>
<p>A very dangerous thing, now there is a remedy. The omnipotence of medicine is indeed undeniable. If people find the above-mentioned misfortune, they can take "Reproduction System," a reproductive gland preparation, which can make the testicles and sexual organs enlarge, the penis increase, and the body and bones in general can develop muscle and strength. At the same time, it directly has the ability to stimulate the function of the reproductive glands, making the function of the endocrine glands flourish, then the sexual organs and the whole body or local parts will naturally develop and grow. Women can take specially made "Female Reproduction Hormone," which can enlarge the breasts, fully reveal the lines, adjust menstruation, and there is absolutely no problem with fertility. As a result of the strengthening of the body, in this way, men and women can enjoy the highest age.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Yarn and Cloth: Many Parties Endure Pain to Cut Losses, Yarn Market Decline Resurges, Prices Down $1.20 to $1.80 Across All Months <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the decline has reignited, largely because new cotton will soon be on the market. Most people expect prices to fall. Although this month's yarn prices are already lower than spot prices, many parties, aware of the unfavorable environment, are enduring pain to cut their losses. This has further weakened market sentiment, causing prices to decline step by step.</p>
<p>This Month Approaching the $200 Mark</p>
<p>At the beginning of the exchange of standard yarn, American cotton of the third grade all showed increases, with near-month contracts rising by 5, 6, 7, and 8 jiao. However, as trading progressed into the later months, the trend reversed, and prices fell by 2 or 3 jiao. After the second session, due to the decline in raw cotton prices, Da Kee, Tai Chang, Feng Tai, Ren Feng, and Xie Cheng aggressively sold off their holdings, causing the market situation to change rapidly. The selling pressure was extremely heavy, with near-month contracts falling by $1.68 and far-month contracts falling by $1.23. By the end of the third session, there was still no sign of recovery. Furthermore, spot yarn transactions decreased. The result of the standard yarn exchange was that prices for all months fell by $1.20, $3.00, $4.00, $7.00, and $8.00 compared to the previous day's closing prices. Da Fu sold 1,000 bales, Tong Kee 600 bales, Heng Yi 700 bales, Ju Xing 800 bales, Yong Yu 600 bales, Feng Tai 1,000 bales, Ren Feng 1,400 bales, Yuan Yi 800 bales, Tai Chang 2,150 bales, Chang Feng 800 bales, Xie Cheng 1,000 bales, and Yong Chang 800 bales. De Da bought 1,100 bales, Yu Kang 1,300 bales, Da Feng 600 bales, Jin Chang 1,900 bales, Ming De 1,750 bales, Tai Xing 700 bales, Da Chang Cheng 800 bales, Tong He 1,250 bales, and Jin Kang 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the half-day trading session are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Show Mixed Trends</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have become clearer, with purchases from various merchant groups decreasing compared to the previous day. A total of 550 bales were sold, with prices showing mixed trends. The purchase amounts of various merchant groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Yunnan 135, Trading Houses 60, Guangdong 20,</p>
<p>Inland 190, Changsha 85, Shantou 10, Xuzhou 15, Fujian 10, Anqing 20</p>
<h3 id="e229">New Cotton Sold Off at Excessively Low Prices, Forward Contract Bulls Cower in Fear <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The decline in old cotton prices continues unabated, mainly because the weather has cleared up and the new cotton harvest is approaching. Factories have no intention of purchasing old cotton, causing market sentiment to weaken. Forward contracts are under heavy pressure because of the excessively low prices at which new cotton is being sold off, and buyers are hesitant to purchase. Only the situation for American cotton seems relatively stable.</p>
<p>Near-Term Old Cotton Falls Back 9.5 Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton exchange, although American cotton rose by 5 to 11 pound-inches, Indian cotton rose and fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Osaka third-grade cotton rose by 56 jiao, market sentiment was extremely weak and sluggish. Moreover, selling pressure was intense. This month's old cotton fell by 3.5 jiao, and new cotton fell by 1.2 jiao. In the second session, the decline in old cotton became even more severe. Because the weather has cleared up, the outlook for cotton is optimistic, and sellers rushed to the market, causing prices to collapse further. As a result of the standard cotton exchange, the price for August fell sharply by 9.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and forward contracts fell by 3.5 to 4 jiao. Heng Yi sold 1,200 dan, Da Kee 1,900 dan, Ming De 1,800 dan, Zhen Da 1,000 dan, He Xing 2,800 dan, Geng Feng 1,100 dan, Yi Chang 2,500 dan, Run Kang 2,900 dan, Heng Chang 2,300 dan, and Sheng Yuan 1,700 dan. Ju Xing bought 1,800 dan, Da Feng 1,000 dan, Yuan Da 1,400 dan, Jin Chang 1,400 dan, Chang Yu 3,100 zu, Shen Chang 2,800 dan, Shen Ji 2,400 dan, Yuan Yi 4,100 dan, Da Chang Cheng 2,000 twisted strands, Yong Chang 1,900 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 1,300 dan. The half-day market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>New Cotton Sold Off: 4,700 Bales</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton shows that new cotton is increasingly developing, and factory demand is also quite strong.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Factories Limit Purchase Prices, American Cotton Turns Stable After Weakness <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, the news from Liverpool was good. Foreign firms purchased contracts, and prices for all months rose by 2 to 4 pound-inches. Subsequently, due to light rain in Oklahoma and the weakness of the grain market, factories limited purchase prices in the afternoon. At the same time, rumors spread that the cooperative would reduce its harvest estimate to 12,600,000 bales, leading short sellers to cover their positions and causing prices to recover. The consensus is that current market prices can be maintained around the government's report of 12,250,000 bales, without any changes. The market closed steadily, with spot prices rising by 6 pound-inches and futures by 6 to 11 pound-inches. British spot cotton remained unchanged, while futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to slight buying, but then weakened as bulls closed out their positions in anticipation of the American cotton government report. However, all sales were absorbed by exporters. Pingguo rose by half a rupee, Oumula fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 6th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 7th is as follows: the price for Bairoxi for the July-August period is 227.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; the price for Bairoxi for the April-May period is 216 rupees, up 1 rupee; and the price for Oumula for the December-January period is 197 rupees, up 1.75 rupees.</p>
<p>Third-Grade Yarn and Cotton Remain Firm: Osaka, 7th. The price of third-grade cotton yarn futures rose by 1 to 7 jiao, with near-month contracts at 209.9 yuan and far-month contracts at 202.5 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 1.5 to 4.5 jiao, with near-month contracts at 67.3 yuan and far-month contracts at 63.9 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Hankou Yarn Prices Also Decline <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The cotton yarn market in this port is sluggish due to intermittent sunny and rainy days and the busy farming season. The output from various factories is stagnant, and unfavorable news from all sides has caused prices to decline by over one yuan. Furthermore, the yarn hoarded by various dealers exceeds the amount held by factories, making it even more difficult to stabilize market prices. The most recent factory prices for various yarn types are as follows: 17-count Double Chicken yarn is 221 yuan, 20-count Green Jockey yarn is 118 yuan, 10-count New Jockey yarn is 211 yuan, 14-count Eternal yarn is 223 yuan, 17-count Hanren Bell yarn is 219 yuan, 10-count Siping Transport yarn is 220 yuan, 17-count Lushan yarn is 210 yuan, 16-count Lushan yarn is 207 yuan, 16-count Lushan yarn is 199 yuan, and 10-count Lushan yarn is 182 yuan.</p>

<p>Gold Market: Yesterday, both customs gold and settlement prices fell, and the overall trend remained weak. Although there was a mid-day rebound, it was only a fleeting phenomenon. Market conditions for half the day were relatively stable. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was flat in both England and America. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo remained unchanged or rose by 6 hao. Exchange rates were slightly higher. The price of raw gold in London fell by one penny. The central bank's listed prices were unchanged in both England and America. The customs gold unit fell by two li. The listed standard gold price fell to 1126.3 yuan. The market opened lower in the morning. Afterwards, as supply was abundant, the price continued to fall due to a lack of support. However, buyers became active at the lower price and gradually rebounded. Short sellers took advantage of the high price to exert pressure, and the buying momentum could not be sustained. With many parties watching from the sidelines, prices soon fell back again. However, the market was supported by large players who limited their purchase prices. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were unchanged in both England and America, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged. After this, the overall trend was stable. Although there were slight fluctuations, the selling pressure was restrained, and there was a lack of any special changes. The noon market remained flat. For swaps, the short side was advancing one yuan for spot delivery. The half-day market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at 1127.4 yuan, down half a yuan from the previous closing price. Chun Yuan, Yong Shen, and Da Yong sold at 7 yuan. Xiang He, Tong Tai Chang, Qia Feng, Yong Ding, and Kang Na rose to 7.8 yuan. Yuan Mao, Yong Da, De Cheng, Yi Cheng, and Hui Xiang sold aggressively at the high price, falling back to 7 yuan. Qia Feng, Yong Fu, Tai Heng, Shen Da, and Yong took advantage of the low price to maintain support. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were unchanged in both England and America, and the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Afterwards, although the price rose to 7.3 yuan, it was extremely stable and lacked volatility. However, due to the supply from Chun Yuan and Yong, the price fell back to 1127.1 yuan at noon.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Standard Gold Price set the settlement price at 1,126.3 yuan, roughly 10 yuan less than the closing price; 11 yuan less than the previous closing.

There are still 914 short term bonds remaining for this month.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Chinese Merchants Still Dumping, Foreign Exchange Process Hardening, Especially for Forward US Dollars <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market remained loose due to continued dumping by Chinese merchants, especially for forward US dollars. In the early morning, overseas telegrams indicated that the London telegraphic transfer rate was flat for both near and far terms. The New York silver market was unchanged. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo remained unchanged or rose by 6 hao. The price of raw gold in London fell by one penny. The exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars rose by 0.375.

The selling price of recent terms in the morning market was 1 shilling 2.375 and 4375 pence for British exchange rates, and 30.125 yuan for US exchange rates. Compared to the previous closing prices, both British and American rates were flat. After opening, Chinese merchants were closing out their positions, and banks maintained support at the low prices. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were unchanged in both England and America, and the market remained relatively stable. The silver equalization tax was unchanged. Banks were trading foreign exchange, but due to weak market sentiment, Chinese merchants were closing out their positions, making it difficult to be optimistic about the overall trend. The market gradually loosened at noon, and Chinese merchants mostly watched from the sidelines, resulting in a flat situation. Bank transactions were relatively active, causing the process to gradually become more lively. By closing, the selling price of recent terms was 1 shilling 2.40625 and 4375 pence for British exchange rates, and 10.125 and 1875 yuan for US exchange rates.

<h3 id="e234">Securities: Selling Pressure Stronger, Public Bond Market Slightly Set Back <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw slight changes in market conditions. Selling pressure was relatively strong, and although market prices were lifted, they could not rally, resulting in a slight setback. The trend may continue to decline, which remains to be seen. Yesterday, at the opening, there were many long and short positions, and competition was fierce. Type E was slightly weak, with more selling of No. 4 and No. 54. The subsequent trend was downwards, falling by a small 2 or 3 jiao. At the closing, there was significant buying of No. 15, and types E and D were relatively firm, rising by about 1 jiao. Afterwards, Nos. 35, 54, and 47 were all sold, and market sentiment gradually weakened. Type A fell by more than 5.5 jiao. As a result, only types E and D remained unchanged this month, while the rest all declined, falling by a small 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 7.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 4,735,000 yuan. The overall rise and fall results are compared and listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e235">Grains: Futures Flour Also Falls Back Sharply <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw constant fluctuations in each month's value after the opening of the morning market. The situation was chaotic. Because the price of foreign wheat was good by eight fen in the near term in Chicago but fell by two or four jiao in the far term, and Canadian grain fell by eight fen to two jiao, prices for this month and September fell about one fen during the opening as actual sales were sluggish. However, the price of October and the October month was raised by two or three fen from the previous day's closing price due to short seller panic buying and some business from Southeast Asia as the price had not risen enough the previous day. At the first month's pricing, as factories released product, hearts softened, and by the second pricing session, prices plummeted as customer brokers and outside investors quit, and Tianjin brokers released product, with the trend strong. All fell by two or three fen at the end of the session for the months of October through December, with January falling sharply with no recovery due to the gap in pricing, falling by a massive seven fen from the previous day's high opening price. Looking at the present, at the time for new wheat, the high prices are already a remarkable situation, and if the international grain market changes, the bulls will be in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Spot Wheat Remains Firm <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw each month's trending price fatigue. Because international wheat prices have softened slightly, the pricing at opening for each month has been amicable, and each is uniformly down two, three, or four fen from the previous day. Transactions for each month have been mostly to wind down positions, though by the end of the session, each of the months from September to December, prices stabilized akin to the previous day because it was reported that the flour market had not loosened much. The price for this month is still down three fen and the price for January is down six fen. Spot wheat prices remain stable, with prices firm. Though the prices are unchanged from yesterday, the product has mostly been resolved. The price of Kai Guan, Dian, and Yaowan wheat is 4.8 yuan, Qin Tong wheat is 4.75 yuan, Wuxi wheat is 4.71 yuan, PuZhen wheat is 4.68 yuan and the pricing to resolving the price is .068 yuan. HanKou wheat is 4.71 and the pricing to resolving the price is .062 yuan. DaoRenQiao wheat is 4.61 yuan, Hefei wheat is 4.78 yuan, Dongge wheat is 4.69 yuan, Nanjing wheat is 4.945 yuan, Suqian wheat is 4.767 yuan, and Luhe wheat is 4.68 yuan. Fufeng got 5000 bags, Fuxing got 4500 bags, and Shen Da got 500 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Market For High Quality Light Paddy Is Still Flat <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai): Yesterday, around number 20 of each group's product had arrived, roughly 4000 stone. The wholesale market is still slow and the packaging brokers are only doing around 100 packages from Dalian brokers, so the market is mostly still flat and fatigued. The price of thick early season glutinous rice is down 5 fen and high quality light paddy is still standing.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai): Yesterday, 17 or 18 boatloads of supplies arrived from each group in HeXia. Each product's sales in the city are very flat, with the high quality prices for white glutinous rice down a small number of fen, and the medium resolving price down a small amount of around 1 jiao. Low paddy and rice is down 1 to 2 jiao, Variable Yuan rice has no rise or fall, and both the port and Du Ke are also trending towards fatigue. The stock of Dong Xin glutinous rice is over 100 stone and is priced at 11 yuan, with ordinary sales.</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Customer Rice Market Still Has Trouble With A Turnaround <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Customer rice continued to arrive. New early season rice also continued to arrive at the port, mostly from Jiangxi rice, and although sales are good, the number of transactions has not increased. Furthermore, the market demand in Sichuan is now dull, and neither the market demand in Ningbo or northern merchant markets is continued. This is why the market does not easily turn around. However, inside news from our street is that business to inland areas is high and there is new business to Guangzhou, so the market may be able to hold its ground. The day's total sales of Jiangxi rice are 3000 packages, Hunan rice 450 packages, and there are hardly any sales for any other rices. However, according to information within the industry, there have been telegrams from Hunan that state the number of items being shipped out of Hunan is not large and that the prices of production are steadily rising, so it is possible that fewer items will be shipped out of Hunan from now on.</p>
<h3 id="e239">North-South Goods: Longan and Melon Seeds Arriving New, Different Harvests...Different Rises and Falls <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>(Zhangzhou New Longan): Yesterday, according to an air express report from Longxi (i.e., Zhangzhou), the new longan there is close to harvest, but due to a hurricane that passed through the area three days ago, the harvests have been affected, and the large ones have fallen by one or two percentage points. The dry goods must arrive in bulk after two weeks. It is predicted that the harvests will only be around sixty percent, so the production price should not be pushed up. Otherwise, there is a risk that those receiving goods will suffer losses. (Xuzhou New Kui Seeds) A communication from Da Cheng in Xuzhou states that although this year's new Xuzhou Kui seeds are more abundant than last year, they are only at a quarter of 1934's numbers. Twenty-third year goods made up a total of 200,000 bags, while this year's numbers are only expected to be around 50,000 bags.</p>
<p>(Hainan New Longan Pulp) Following the freefall in pricing, sales have been pretty good in the days since. However, a check of the goods arriving on the two rounds to Jia Ying and Haikou show that the numbers have not been strong, with demand outstripping supply. Therefore, price listings have tightened and the prices listed by businesses in Nanshi have risen by five or six yuan on the higher priced goods, with regular, poorer goods expected to hold steady for now unless the goods arriving are not strong.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Sugar Market: Chaoshan Sugar Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Public Association, prices for various types of sugar such as No. 4 coarse sand white and Nos. 4, 8, and 9 East White remained as before, with few buyers. There were no changes in the prices of local factory cotton white brands such as Zhenji, Jinxin, and Renhua. The domestic sugar market remained strong. Guangdong and Chaozhou merchants offered several hundred packages of cotton red sugar, with higher prices at $15.30 and ordinary prices at $14.40. There were over one hundred packages of Huizhou white sugar, priced between $19.20 and $18.60, and one hundred packages of Hainan foreign sugar, priced at $15.45. According to reports from Shantou, production costs continue to rise. Currently, the cost for Shanghai City, including extraction fees, is $14.78 for top-grade blue, $14.40 for top-grade Huanggang blue, and $12.70 for top-grade Longqing blue. Genuine cotton red sugar is priced at $16.60, with an exchange rate of $1,100. According to reports from Zhangzhou, Chaozhou and Shantou merchants are purchasing Diaoqing in Zhangzhou, so production costs have also increased by five or six jiao.</p>
<p>The jointly formed company held its third weekly tender for Guangdong sugar yesterday, with a total quota of over 6,000 packages. Garlic prices remained unchanged. Two hundred packages of Shun De Factory’s Five Rams coarse white sugar were sold at $21.60, another 1,320 packages from Dongguan Factory were sold at $21.50, and another 150 packages from Qu Xi Factory were sold at $21.10. The remaining packages were not sold.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Textiles: Cotton Cloth Shortages Maintain Current Status <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was such that although the yarn market had seen continuous and significant declines, the cloth market was able to maintain its price level due to a shortage of available goods. The decline was slow. Yarn prices fell by $17 or $18 per piece, while cloth prices fell by only $5 or $6 per piece. Therefore, manufacturers' attitudes have softened, and they are opening goods in line with the market. However, trading houses and dye factories are seeing sluggish sales and weakening interest due to buyer hesitancy. Dongpi white goods, fine cloth, coarse cloth, and fine twill all saw price decreases of 5 fen per piece. Color goods saw fewer changes. Only Sijunzi Zhigong and Biji continued to decrease by 1.5 li per yard. This factory's current autumn goods, including patterned and plain Zhigong, Biji, and flannel, remain very strong. Products are scarce, and buyers are eager to purchase more. Only Dafeng Factory’s Caishen crepe fell by 5 li per yard. Yesterday, buyers from Hunan, Tanzhou, Changsha, and Changde purchased a large amount of Dong goods such as Sijunzi straight satin, totaling over one hundred and dozens of pieces. Previously, Dongpi straight satin Biji from this region used the Star brand mark, but this procedure is no longer necessary. Buyers from Sichuan and Hunan have placed large orders for futures of this factory's Dafeng Guangzhong Biji Zhigong ne flannel, etc. The flannel white flannel from this group was the earliest to be loaded. Business in Zhejiang is most active in Wenzhou and Taizhou. Yesterday, they purchased over one hundred pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, Biji Zhigong, crepe, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Suddenly Improves; China-France Silk Prices Gradually Converging <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market suddenly improved. Near-term standard New York silk soared by 5.5 fen, while long-term silk rose by 3 fen. Japanese silk 83 and 75 evenness each rose by 2 fen. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk both rose by 3 fen. Yokohama spot prices rose by 25 yuan, and futures prices rose by 20 yuan. Lyon remained stable. Silk from foreign firms in Shanghai is gradually becoming smooth. Yesterday, Mitsui, Lianna, Xinfu, and other firms all showed interest, with a total transaction volume of 170 bales. The French silk market is also gradually becoming active. Buyers and sellers are exchanging telegrams, and prices may gradually converge. If overseas silk prices can stabilize, then export silk can regain its prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Qining Black Tea Trading Turns Active <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>However, the market is slightly smaller by three yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw relatively active trading in Qining black tea. Jardine Matheson, a British firm, showed very strong interest. Among them, the floral fragrance category saw transactions reaching over 1,600 boxes, with a market price of $30, slightly lower by two or three yuan compared to before. As for the inland sources, several hundred boxes have been shipped to Shanghai in recent days, and the situation is quite prosperous. Green tea sales still did not see much progress yesterday. Most merchants are observing the price of Zhenmei green tea. Only transactions in Zhenmei and Xiumei goods continued to be active.</p>
<p>According to the report from the Tea Industry Association, after the price of Huizhou Zhenmei fell the day before yesterday, the market became more active yesterday. Baolong purchased 500 boxes of Dong Zhenmei at a price of $65. Xiehe purchased 400 boxes of Chunzhen Middle and High Zhuang at prices ranging from $73 to $92. Jardine Matheson purchased over a hundred boxes of pearls at prices ranging from $90 to $93. Jinlong and Baochang showed slight interest in various types of Zhenmei, but the selling prices of each tea, such as Huizhou Zhenmei, fell sharply by seven or eight yuan compared to before. Transactions in Ping Shui teas remained sluggish, with only Zhenmei stripes and Youzhang Xiehe Yongxing being selected for purchase in dozens of pieces each.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Seafood: New Dried Scallops' Slow Sales Lead to Gradual Market Easing; Abundant Harvest of New Ningbo Light Mussels <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of new dried scallops is gradually increasing, but the volume of sales to buyers has decreased instead. As a result, selling prices from trading houses have gradually eased. Yesterday, the market quoted prices of $68.50 for Dongzhong strips and $70 for fine strips. Tou Chao Shen Jue goods were only quoted at $54. Because market operators still have previous goods in stock, they are temporarily uninterested in further purchases, so there are few buyers. The market is likely to see further price declines.</p>
<p>Most of the new Dong light mussels that have arrived in recent days are of lower grades. The market operators are gradually lowering their prices. Yesterday, goods priced at $62.80 were not only small but also had shrunken bodies and dull colors. Market prices for high-quality goods remained at $78. Fewer were being sold at the current price, but the current market price is $60, and most are willing to sell. This year's domestic Ningbo light mussels have had a very abundant harvest with excellent quality, but not surprisingly, many goods have been shipped, making it difficult to raise prices. The current market price for new seed mussels is $34 or $35, $37 or $38 for sifted clean mussels, and $46 for yuan mussels.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Which Path to Take? <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Danxing</p>
<p>At the end of the last semester, many female students have completed their basic education. Stepping out of the middle school gate on one side, and preparing to enter university for further studies on the other, they inevitably face the dilemma of a fork in the road. The biggest problem is how to choose a specialized discipline. Before them lie education, music, art, medicine, sericulture, literature, plus law, physics and chemistry, physical education, transportation, civil engineering, and even military and aviation. In the current extraordinary period, women also have the possibility of research and learning. However, the array of disciplines has dazzled the female students, making their minds waver. Which subject should they choose? Which subject is suitable for them to study? Which path leads to their destination? They must carefully consider this.</p>
<p>The period of solving this problem contains a crucial key to the future life of female students. Many students who love music, however, go on to study civil engineering. Many students who love literature, on the contrary, blindly follow to study physics and chemistry. As a result, they constantly feel a kind of pain that violates their personality. Even if they bury themselves in their studies with heart, there is a discordant trend, achieving half the result with twice the effort. Some change course halfway, the loss of spirit, time, and economy is self-evident. In addition to the recognition of one's aspirations and goals, one must also consider whether one can suit one's personality. If one already has a fiancé, then for the sake of future cooperation in seeking a living in society, one should choose a discipline that is the same as or related to the other party as much as possible, so as not to have conflicting interests in the future, which will not only fail to obtain mutual assistance between husband and wife, but will also lead to adverse phenomena. However, this point cannot be stubbornly adhered to.</p>
<p>Adapting to the needs of the environment is also a criterion for female students to choose a subject. Female students in rural areas, in order to save the decline of the rural economy, must resolve to study sericulture and agriculture. Even if the interest is slightly inferior, they can only sacrifice their own interests and save the public. This is one example. What about other such things as military affairs, aviation? Medical and first aid services are especially needed in China during this extraordinary period. Strictly speaking, studying is not only for oneself, for the family, but also for the society, the nation, and the country. Even music and art are no exception.</p>
<p>Female students who have completed their basic education, various specialties are in front of you, which path do you take? This question must be decided by yourselves, to suit your personality and to suit the environment. Blindly following and experimenting are not right!</p>
<h3 id="e252">Women's Professions and Professional Women <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Duan</p>
<p>In China, which has not completely shaken off old ideas, women only have the role of staying at home. On the one hand, parents for their daughters, and parents-in-law for their daughters-in-law, hold the 18th-century notion of "relying on parents at home and relying on husbands after marriage," and do not allow women to run to society to make a living. They think that it is such an "indecent" act for a woman to go outside to do something instead of enjoying herself at home. On the other hand, many women also only know how to enjoy themselves and rely solely on others after finishing their studies at school, and thus abandon their promising lives to live the life of a caged bird. Although there are also those who are not tempted by vanity, but with a firm and indomitable spirit of fearlessness, struggle with the environment and finally achieve victory, and go on the path of a profession.</p>
<p>In China, where women's professions are not widespread, where is the way out for women? A few shops and institutions occasionally employ a few female staff. On the surface, they chant "promoting women's professions," but in reality, they all have bad intentions. Some employ female staff to attract customers, others hire them to relieve the boredom of office life to be used as entertainment, and even borrow the guise of "profession" to carry out their purposes of bullying and toying. They think that women are only things for people to play with and admire, so the derogatory nickname "flower vase" is quickly added to the heads of professional women.</p>
<p>Are all women useless? Are they only worthy of being toys for men? Of course, we absolutely cannot admit this. But where does this come from, and we have to examine it: Look at so many women who come to society to work only with the "showing off" principle, and this is the main reason. Some are even tempted by vanity and spare no effort to abandon their actual lives and pursue them, and eventually fall into a vicious trap and fall; others are self-proclaimed romantic, dressing up in grotesque shapes to flatter the manager, treating the office as a social place; and still others do nothing all day long, only mingling with male staff, flirting and scolding, doing everything. These are, of course, only a minority of the minority, but when women's professions are just beginning, this is at least very unfavorable to other women. These shameless scoundrels eventually implicate others in being looked down upon and despised; women's professions are invisibly further devalued and increasingly declining.</p>
<p>It is a despicable thing to use the promotion of women's professions as a tool to carry out the purpose of toying with women. People who chant "women should go to society" should use an honest attitude to open up a way out for women. At the same time, professional women who serve society, can you endure this insulting title? Do you willingly fail to make progress? No, never, quickly strengthen your will, avoid the temptation of vanity, respect your personality, devote yourself to practical work, contribute to society, and create happiness for yourself. The great road of women's professions with unlimited prospects is waiting for you to develop and move forward!</p>
<h3 id="e253">I Returned to My Family <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoliang</p>
<p>When I graduated from ×× Middle School, I had great ambitions. For the women of our country who have been bound by traditional ideas for thousands of years, I really wanted to do some work of liberation, so that everyone could run out of their families and serve society, to fight for equal and free status for our women.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the autumn of that year, I found a small position in a bank. The day I went to take office, I was so happy that I thought I could get rid of the bondage from then on and do a little for the women's world.</p>
<p>But it is also pitiful to say, after I had worked for a few months, besides my colleague Ms. Zhang being able to express sympathy for my opinions, the other female colleagues all thought that my ideas were strange. No matter what methods I used to contact them, there was no way. They were all poisoned by modern times. They only wanted to watch movies, talk about love, and pay attention to clothing. When I talked to them about the liberation of women themselves, they would also express headaches and disgust. Even reading books, they only liked love novels. In this way, my ambition in school was weakened a lot. It turns out that Chinese women are so unpromising!</p>
<p>After doing this for more than a year, I fell into the river of love and finally got married in the winter of that year. My husband worked in the telegraph bureau, his salary was sixty yuan, plus my thirty yuan, and our monthly life was very good. But in the second year, I gave birth to a child and couldn't work, so the total income was only sixty yuan. It was impossible to allocate to maintain the two of us, a child, and a nanny. So after a few months, I had to go back to work. But it cost too much money to use a wet nurse for the child, so I decided to let him eat milk powder during the day and I would feed him at night, but this was wishful thinking. The child did not eat milk during the day, and my own milk was so painful. In order to work, I had to let the child eat milk powder completely. Naturally, our expenses increased, and when the two of us were out working, the clothes were washed by the laundry, and we ate mostly outside. Only on Sundays did I cook myself, but now I had to prepare meals every day. The nanny was in charge of the housework, but not only did she not know how to save money, but the money spent each month often exceeded my budget, and the things she did could not satisfy me. Therefore, I had to give up my job and return home.</p>
<p>Now I have dismissed the nanny, and I am doing all the household chores, such as washing clothes, cooking, taking care of the children, etc.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, I feel that Chinese women must obtain true liberation: first, the modern poison of the current era should be eradicated; second, we should also unite with men who sympathize with us, and jointly thoroughly transform the social system, so that women have the same status as men in society and are not burdened by housework, so that we can truly talk about liberation!</p>

<h3 id="e255">A Visit to Dr. Qian Jianqiu <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Among the freelance professionals in Shanghai, lawyers are the most numerous, with a total of more than 1,200 people. Our journalists are less than half their number; there are also fewer doctors than them; and accountants are even further behind. Naturally, there are more men in the legal profession than women. These female lawyers each have their own position and their own strengths. Today, I want to introduce one of the outstanding female lawyers – Dr. Qian Jianqiu. This is not just flattering her. In fact, her thinking, knowledge, and personality can all be models for women. People like this will naturally be respected by everyone. Dr. Qian is currently a member of the Lawyers Association and a professor at Shanghai Law College. She is not only proficient in law, but also has a good foundation in literature and calligraphy. She has also occupied a glorious page in the history of drama. Readers, do you remember the sensational play "The Lady's Fan" twelve years ago? That play broke the box office drought in Shanghai. She played the role of Ms. Jin in the play and said more than a thousand words of dialogue in one breath, which made the audience shed countless tears. Her genius was revealed in this play, and even shocked the whole society. This is truly a miracle.</p>
<p>Director Hong Shen then persuaded her to study drama, but her ambition was not small, and she believed that drama was not the greatest wish after all. In 1929, she went to the United States and entered Northwestern University in Chicago, specializing in law and earning a doctorate. After returning to China, she practiced law. Three years ago, she married Mr. Huang Bi. This Dr. Huang was a good companion who went to the United States at the same time, at the same level, with the same degree, and returned to China with the same path. You can imagine how perfect this marriage is! However, after their marriage, he was an official in the capital, and she worked at sea, separated by a long distance, each fulfilling their duties. Although it is said that children are sentimental, they also treat it calmly. This is another miracle.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Right Picture: Dr. Qian Standing <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, I visited her and talked for an hour. The first question was: "What are your views on the new family?"</p>
<p>She said, "The responsibilities of new Chinese women are much heavier than those of men. Men simply work externally, while women not only need to develop their personal new careers but also bear the responsibility of the new family. Isn't taking care of both inside and outside heavier than for men? That being said, the current women have not yet reached the 'new' stage. Everyone knows that in the past, in large family systems, labor and leisure were uneven, and happiness and suffering differed. It fostered dependence and led to a desire to shirk responsibility, resulting in numerous malpractices, which were obviously not as good as the perfect small family system. However, the new family is not without its drawbacks. The most easily discovered shortcoming is the equal attitude of the couple. I believe that a couple must establish an attitude of 'respect and love' and 'understanding.' Westerners value this very much, while we Chinese seem to be somewhat indifferent. If a couple can 'respect and love' each other, they will support and help each other, as if they were two as one. If they can 'understand' each other, any misunderstandings can be turned from major to minor, and from minor to nothing. However, when major matters arise at home, both parties must reach a consensus. One cannot act unilaterally. One should explore calmly and rationally, and one cannot easily abandon one's straightforward views for the sake of 'understanding.' At this moment, one should emphasize facts and reduce emotionality, so as to avoid conflicts and disputes. Regardless of poverty or wealth, the new family should universally adopt diligence, thrift, hard work, and endurance as common principles. It is best not to rely on others for household affairs. If servants are needed in reality, they should be treated kindly and not despised, and they should be trained to be literate and know etiquette. They come from the countryside and have missed the opportunity to study when they were young. If they are not trained, they often have deceitful, irresponsible, and rude behaviors, which are infinitely harmful to others and themselves. There should not be too many children. With too many children, it is difficult to provide comprehensive education. It increases the responsibility of parents and the suffering of the family. Family education must be highly valued. Great personalities are cultivated in small families. People who work hard all day long cannot do without entertainment, but improper entertainment should not exist in the new family. The entertainment I advocate includes: (1) outings in the suburbs; (2) physical activities; (3) attending concerts and gatherings; (4) connection between families with like-minded people; (5) watching noble dramas or movies. As for the responsibilities of the housewife, managing household affairs is the minimum. Further, she should assist her husband's career. Those with superior abilities should give full play to their personal aspirations and do more to benefit the public, ensuring that they take care of both inside and outside without bias, and only then can they be called women of the new era.</p>
<p>When women serve externally, they should not think that since they are women, they should enjoy special rights and do less work or only do light work. This kind of mentality is an inferior mentality that degrades women's status. We rely entirely on actual strength to do things. If we have sufficient ability and real talent, we will naturally be respected, and there is no distinction between men and women.</p>
<p>"What kind of standards should modern young women have for self-cultivation?"</p>
<p>When I raised this question, she pondered for a moment and then gave the following answer: "The circumstances of each person are different, and the standards of self-cultivation will always be somewhat different. I think every young woman should pay special attention to: (1) Virtue has nothing to do with 'new' or 'old.' The sage said, 'Words should be faithful and trustworthy, and actions should be honest and respectful.' This is the foundation of self-conduct and dealing with the world. (2) Develop an independent spirit and eliminate the psychology of dependence. (3) Forge a strong physique. (4) Establish the concept of society and the country. (5) Have a broad vision and not be constrained by trivial matters. (6) Respect one's own personality. One more point: women who have the opportunity to study should never easily give up this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Those from poor families cannot afford to go to school, while those who are more well-off should aspire to make progress and not bury their youthful ambitions. They should embrace the aspiration that 'what I learn today will surely be used for society in the future.'"</p>
<p>"From a legal point of view, in recent decades, women in various countries have demanded equal legal treatment and have long achieved their goals. The current laws of most countries have generally adopted the principle of gender equality, and most of the parts that deprived women have been abolished. However, in law, rights and obligations are equal conditions. If you enjoy rights, you must fulfill your obligations. Since the law grants women the right to enjoy equal rights, whether they can actually fulfill the same obligations as men is entirely a matter of fact. The law only advocates it."</p>
<p>"Because of legal equality, I thought of an interesting thing. For example, in terms of women's titles, women's names are often prefixed with their husband's surname after marriage. I wonder if there is any legal basis for this?"</p>
<p>She said, "According to current law, there is indeed a provision that 'a wife prefixes her original surname with her husband's surname,' but this is not mandatory, and the parties can freely use it. In fact, it is very common for a wife's surname to be prefixed with her husband's surname. Some women even do not use their own names after marriage and are only called Mrs. XXX. This kind of title is also very popular in European and American countries. European and American female students often do not use their original names after marriage and are called Mrs. - in social occasions. In my opinion, it is not necessary to prefix the original surname with the husband's surname. Even if the original name is used, there is absolutely no inconvenience."</p>
<p>She finally stated, "The most important issue in China today lies in education. I often feel great sympathy for the aspiring young people who are poor and out of school and the majority of ignorant people. I have a plan in my heart, but unfortunately, I cannot implement it now. Once I have sufficient financial resources, I will offer a sum of money to reward and help the young people with thoughts and talents, so that they can have a place to belong to and achieve success in their studies, and create great careers for the society and the country. I hope that the powerful people in the society will advocate this. It is truly immeasurable merit. Like the United States, there are many rich people who donate their estates to famous universities to cultivate promising young people. Is it possible that we Chinese cannot do this great plan for cultivating people for a hundred years?"</p>
<h3 id="e257">The Lament of Ancient Chinese Heroic Female Poets (III) <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>Separation in life, death, longing for spring, late years, unrequited love, abandonment, mismatched marriage, and chaos due to war. "Worship the new moon, worship the moon emerging from the hall; the dark spirit deeply imitates the cassia; the empty bow is not drawn... Worship the new moon, worship the moon with overwhelming emotion. The moon approaches as people grow old, and gazing at the moon prolongs life. The mother of the family to the east also worships the moon, and with each worship, her voice breaks with sorrow. In the past, she worshiped the moon to show off her beauty, but now she worships the single tear of vermilion. Looking back at the women worshiping the new moon, I recall my youth in the boudoir!"</p>
<p>In the song "Zhu Gong Qu" by Liu Cai Chun, a female poet from eastern Zhejiang appreciated by Yuan Wei Zhi, there is also a five-character poem lamenting old age:</p>
<p>"Yesterday was better than today, this year is older than last year. The Yellow River may become clear one day, but there is no chance for white hair to turn black!"</p>
<p>The Lament of Unrequited Love</p>
<p>A scholar dies for his confidant, and a woman adorns herself for her admirer. It is also the most unbearable thing in a woman's psychology to pity herself and not be able to gain the favor of her lover. Lady Hou, a palace maid of Emperor Yang of Sui, hanged herself out of resentment for not being able to be favored by the emperor. She had a brocade pouch tied to her arm, which contained a poem:</p>
<p>"Adorned with much self-pity, good dreams turn into sorrow. Not as good as the meaning of willow catkins, flying wherever spring arrives."</p>
<p>"Wanting to cry but unable to shed tears, grief turns into forced song, the flowers in the courtyard are blooming brilliantly, but there is no way to deal with spring!"</p>
<p>Wu Zetian, as an extraordinary female hero, had countless male favorites, and also had poems of unrequited love. Her "Ru Yi Qu" says:</p>
<p>"Seeing red as green, thoughts are chaotic, haggard and distraught for the sake of billions of subjects.</p>
<p>If you don't believe that I often shed tears lately, open the box and examine the pomegranate skirt." Emperor Ming of Tang initially favored Consort Mei, Jiang Cai Ping, but later favored Yang Tai Zhen, and moved Consort Mei to Shangyang Palace. When an envoy from a foreign country presented pearls, Emperor Ming bestowed a bushel of them to Consort Mei, who responded with a poem:</p>
<p>"Cassia leaves and eyebrows have not been painted for a long time, residual makeup mixed with tears wets the red silk, spending the whole day without combing, why bother consoling with pearls!"</p>
<p>The Lament of Abandonment</p>
<p>Mandarin ducks and phoenixes in harmony, growing old together, this is the happiest couple in the world. However, there are countless infatuated men and resentful women in the world. At first, there were oaths of love, but in the end, the mandarin ducks and phoenixes drifted apart. In a feudal society that valued men over women, the abandoned women could only swallow their tears and remain silent, with no law to appeal to. Under the cage of old ethics, they still had to maintain their reputation and self-restraint. From the following poems, one can imagine the sorrow of the generally abandoned women in ancient times.</p>
<p>"Mandarin ducks are on the beam, folding their left wings. This person is unkind, changing their virtue again and again!" (Poem Bai Hua, seven chapters. King You of Zhou obtained Bao Si and deposed Queen Shen, so the people of Zhou wrote this poem.)</p>
<p>"Newly torn Qi fine silk, as white and clean as frost and snow, cut into a fan of conjugal bliss, round like the bright moon. Entering and exiting your sleeves, swaying with a gentle breeze. Often fearing the arrival of autumn, cool winds take away the heat, discarded in the bamboo chest, affection and love severed halfway!"</p>
<p>(During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, Ban Jie Yu was slandered by Zhao Fei Yan's sisters. Jie Yu feared danger, so she served the Empress Dowager in Changxin Palace and wrote the poem of the silk fan.)</p>
<p>"Lonely white rabbit, running east and looking west. Clothes are not as good as new, people are not as good as old!" (Song of Complaint by Han Bao Yuan's Wife)</p>
<p>"Who says the divorced wife is gone? The divorced wife's feelings are even stronger. One should not spit in a well a thousand miles away, let alone what was previously served! Looking far is not painful, hesitating but unable to share." (Wei Liu Dong's wife, Wang Song, was divorced for being childless and wrote this poem.)</p>
<p>"Who does not love the beauty of spring flowers, but eventually they are hurt when they fall in autumn. The smoke from the chimney still lowers itself, and it is not expected to be humble and retreat! Cassia fragrance is in vain, losing love is in the moth eyebrows. Sitting and watching the beautiful season end, haggard and mocking myself in vain!" (Song of Complaint after Jin Shi Chong's maid Xiang Feng was abandoned.)</p>
<p>The Lament of Mismatched Marriage</p>
<p>In ancient times, marriages were based on the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers, not by the choice of the person involved; or even if they were self-chosen, they were still blind. Therefore, whether due to incompatible personalities or unmatched talents and appearance, there was the sorrow of a colorful phoenix following a crow, and precious jade falling into filth. The man-eating ethics of staying together until death shackled them so that they could not escape. A dumb person eating coptis chinensis, unable to express their suffering, such as Zhuang Jiang of Wei in the Three Hundred Poems; and Li Qing Zhao and Zhu Shu Zhen among the female poets of the Song Dynasty, can be said to be representatives of this.</p>

<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Wen Feng, needless to say, was definitely a top-notch modern Shanghai lady. Since she was so careful in selecting maids for their beauty, how could she not pay attention to her own beauty? Because she was beautiful, her female classmates and friends were naturally very beautiful too; moreover, she was secretly dating a handsome lover!</p>
<p>Under the favor of her mistress, Xiang Lin naturally worked very hard. She inevitably gossiped a bit, but that could be ignored. However, she was originally a flirtatious person. Since entering the He family and spending every day with Wen Feng and her group of friends, her desire for extravagance and vanity grew stronger day by day. In addition, Xiang Lin treated her very politely, so everyone dared not treat her as a servant. She was truly extremely free. When she first came, she wore short clothes, but later she changed to long cheongsams, and even high heels. Needless to say, she permed her hair and wore makeup. Her looks were originally above Wen Feng's, and now that she had put so much effort into dressing up, she completely overshadowed Wen Feng. Outsiders who didn't know the details couldn't guess that they were mistress and servant.</p>
<p>"Look, Xiang Lin from the He family is even more beautiful than Wen Feng herself..."</p>
<p>"Isn't Xiang Lin's appearance a standard beauty? How can Wen Feng compare..."</p>
<p>Gradually, these kinds of words were whispered in everyone's mouths, and eventually they reached Wen Feng's ears. This naturally made her very unhappy. No matter how much she loved Xiang Lin, she couldn't tolerate people saying that she herself was not as beautiful as Xiang Lin. But she had chosen her herself, so how could she chase her away now? So she had to secretly use a passive means to deal with her. First, she restricted her from wearing makeup, saying that the old master didn't like it; second, she restricted her from wearing high heels, saying that the old lady disliked the sound of her walking. Xiang Lin naturally had to obey, so she changed to wearing a pair of embroidered satin shoes, and without makeup, she revealed her original exquisite face. Oh! This was even more beautiful! Wen Feng still thought it was too eye-catching, so she went a step further and restricted her from perming her hair. In this way, Xiang Lin simply didn't cut her hair and, after a few months, tied up her hair into a bun herself. Who knew that people thought she was even more beautiful. People up and down the He family were surprisingly exclaiming, "Xiang Lin is even more beautiful now, just like a young mistress."</p>
<p>A young mistress, of course, has the kind of beauty of a young mistress. Wen Feng carefully observed that Xiang Lin's beauty had indeed taken on a kind of beauty of a young mistress. At the same time, she also discovered that she had to change her embroidered satin shoes almost every five days, and she bought a lot of things, as if she had plenty of money; she often asked for leave on Saturdays and Sundays, and her words were not as soft as before. Wen Feng therefore became extremely suspicious. Later, she suddenly discovered that her own lover's attitude towards her was gradually becoming indifferent. If he called and Xiang Lin answered the phone, he would often talk for a few minutes. Wen Feng questioned him, but he denied it. But one day, she finally found her lover in a movie theater with Xiang Lin, sitting shoulder to shoulder and whispering, looking just like a newly married couple. Wen Feng was furious. When the movie ended, she deliberately waited at the exit; who knew that the two of them walked away hand in hand, as if they hadn't seen her at all.</p>
<p>Wen Feng returned home with a livid face. She threw all of Xiang Lin's things out of the door and wanted to wait for her to come back and beat her severely, but she waited until dawn and Xiang Lin didn't come back. From then on, she officially went to live with Wen Feng's lover and practice the love of cohabitation.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3 id="e260">Reading the Newspaper <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Yesterday, after dinner, I had nothing to do, so I picked up a Shen Bao newspaper to read. In terms of foreign news, I saw that Li Bai had proposed peace terms, requesting the central government to give him a nominal position to go abroad, and that Chairman Jiang had telegraphed Li Bai again, urging him to leave Gui as soon as possible and take up his new position. I was very happy to read this. According to this situation, the Gui army's changes are likely to be resolved peacefully. If so, it is admirable that Li Bai has such a deep understanding of the overall situation.</p>
<p>Later, I also read that the Japanese were deeply infiltrating Ningxia and Gansu, organizing special agencies in various banners, and conducting activities in Alxa Banner, Pingliang, and other places. I also read that the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin was planning a program to expand the police power in North China. I also read that Japanese ruffians were setting up factories in Tianjin and privately manufacturing drugs. I also read that the Japanese army in the Japanese concession in Tianjin was practicing street fighting. I also read that the Japanese navy was preparing a new national defense plan to dominate the Pacific. I also read the current commentary on the issue of Japan arbitrarily establishing a consulate general in Chengdu. I unknowingly slammed the teacup in my hand onto the patio with a bang, shattering it into thirteen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine pieces.</p>
<p>I didn't like reading such news. I turned around to look at world news. The first item was that the Afghan people were not giving up and continued to fiercely resist the Italian army. Forty thousand Afghan troops advanced towards Taixi. It was rare for the Afghan people to have such a hard-working spirit. The second item was that Britain and Germany expressed their approval of non-interference in Spanish internal affairs, but Germany required the same acceptance by the Soviet Union as a condition, while Italy had not yet replied and its attitude was unclear. The third item was the truth about the Italian plane, and the French investigation was completed, proving that it belonged to the regular Italian air force. The fourth item was that German warships had arrived at the Port of Ceuta, but according to the German Ministry of the Army, the purpose was to protect overseas Chinese. Looking at the situation of various countries competing with each other, Spain was unlikely to be the fuse for the Second World War, and I couldn't help but take seventeen or eighteen breaths of cold air.</p>
<p>Reading domestic news was so frustrating, and reading foreign news was so irritating. I thought I would look at the local news, which would definitely be more interesting. Let's read the price! First, Japanese sailors continued to investigate evidence of rural construction; second, the old Taoist Gao Lianliang of Zhunlian Society, the shameful father and son suing each other; third, bandits robbing Xiang Sheng's car; fourth, a socialite in Suzhou suing for abandonment and the judgment; fifth, two men and women throwing themselves into the river, and Liu Zhengxing being accused; eighth, two boys from Zhabei being abducted in Xiamen, and their families being invited to come and identify them; ninth, Xu Deyu's nephew, abducting and hiding his young daughter; tenth, a traveler in a Wuxi hotel taking poison. Ah! The situation in Shanghai society is so bad, either adultery or theft, either abduction or fraud, either drugs or murder. What kind of society is this?</p>
<p>Originally, I didn't read the newspaper much. Today, I happened to read the newspaper, and the impressions I discovered everywhere are like this. If I read the previous newspapers, I am afraid there will be many situations even worse than today's. The old accounts can be ignored. If I want to read the newspaper again in the future, I am afraid that the situation will continue to deteriorate. It is also unknown. The only thing that is barely satisfactory is that Li Bai proposed peace terms and requested the central government to give him a nominal position to go abroad. However, whether it can be implemented remains to be seen in the future. Therefore, I do not want to read the newspaper next time.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Days of Hardship <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>We received a telegram from the provincial government saying that the Moro people had rebelled. For the sake of my job, I was sent by the newspaper to cover the story.</p>
<p>This place belongs to part of Moro Province. The uprising took place in a small town. This town has only a short street, densely packed with hundreds of low zinc houses. Chinese and Japanese merchants live in the houses. These merchants exist by exchanging very low-priced foreign goods for coconuts and grains from the inland.</p>
<p>A broken freight car loaded me up, swinging on the hillside like a pendulum. The driver was a local, a dark and short man around forty years old. He timidly told me:</p>
<p>"People who are used to living in big cities would never dream that such a thing would happen here..." He sighed lowly, his face a little pale. "They are not human, but beasts. Just think: they are all naked, with red cloth strips tied around their heads. In the middle of the night, they rushed into the town like bees. Then, the whole town was filled with shouts. People screamed and cried in confusion. In the darkness, nothing could be distinguished. It was all dark people, naked people jumping around. From time to time, only a few rays of knife light flashed..." He shook his head again. After thinking deeply for a while, he murmured again, "This is a miracle, sir, it hasn't been seen for more than thirty years..."</p>
<p>There is a church here, but it has already been surrounded by rioters with wood and burned down. The fire has not yet been extinguished. The open space is full of charcoal smells and rubble. Four or five police officers are directing a large number of workers. Starting excavation work, because several Spanish priests were buried alive in the rubble.</p>
<p>"This is a great misfortune!" I went to visit the police chief of the town branch, a tall middle-aged man. He first waved his hand, and then shouted in an excited tone, "But we have done our best to fulfill our responsibilities. Heaven is my witness. From the beginning to the end, I spent all my energy leading the only twelve police officers to fight against those one thousand rioters... And now, it's all over, like a flash of lightning..."</p>
<p>His face trembled slightly, and then he smiled solemnly.</p>
<p>"I hope you can tell me the reason for this uprising," I asked.</p>
<p>"This," he frowned deeply, thought for a while, and then continued, "This is very clear. Three Japanese shops, united to deceive a group of Moro people. First, the merchants shouted like this, when those natives brought large quantities of coconuts from the inland.</p>
<p>—We are very welcome, old friends! Can you allow me to pay a special price to keep your goods?</p>
<p>—Yes, we are very willing! The Moro people answered in cheerful tones.</p>
<p>—Then weigh them! Then the merchants took out the scale that could turn one hundred and fifty pounds of goods into one hundred and five pounds. I'm sorry, sir, I have to explain that the Chinese and Japanese merchants here live on this. Without this, they can't survive, they really can't survive. Finally, these merchants gave him a few fun items and said gently:</p>
<p>—Good friends, the coconuts have been weighed. In two days, just two more days, you can come here to get what you want...</p>
<p>The Moro people were very satisfied with this answer, gently took those fun items with their hands, stroked them for a while, and walked away with them in their arms. But after a few days, they went down the mountain to get what they wanted, but found that the zinc houses were empty, and the merchants had moved away, so they returned to the mountain with disappointed faces. After a few days like this, the incident happened..."</p>
<p>At this time, someone hurried in, so I said goodbye to leave. He followed me happily behind and sent me away.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I can't entertain you properly. If Manila wants to publish this news, please add a few words for me: Marlor, the police chief of Zhi Luo Town, did his duty and bravely quelled the three thousand rioters with twelve police officers in the dark night..."</p>
<p>I said that I would be happy to serve him. We shook hands and parted ways.</p>
<p>On the street, I walked slowly. Many of the low, neat zinc houses had been burned down. Only a few dozen remained. The doors were tightly closed. In one open grocery store, a dozen Chinese people were huddled together, arguing about something. They all had weapons in their hands: such as broadswords, short wooden sticks, pistols... It is said that in order to defend against these rioters from coming to disturb them again, they had armed themselves, ready to help the brave police chief pacify the rebellion when necessary.</p>
<p>But an old Chinese man told me with a worried tone: "Our efforts may be in vain. These natives are very brave, and when they come in, it's like a tide. Just the cowhide drum, the shouts! It's enough to scare us." After a pause, he said again: "In order to resist, we have had twelve people killed, including five whose heads are missing..." He was very worried, sinking into unease and depression, his eyes shooting out light of terror and despair.</p>
<p>Next to a small house not far away, there was a sorrowful woman's wail, slowly seeping through. The old man pointed with his finger and shook his head in despair, saying: "This is one of those who were killed, young, his wife had only just come from Tangshan, but she encountered this disaster. It's been three days, and the head hasn't been found yet..." I also shook my head in sympathy. He was silent for a while before murmuring in a low voice:</p>
<p>"This is a year of hardship..." I looked up at him, and his eye sockets were already overflowing with tears.</p>

<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>When they heard us say that we saw them in the valley ahead, they hurried forward.</p>
<p>Our hearts were beating wildly. I grabbed the last person and asked, "What are you asking those two people to do?"</p>
<p>"Those two people are perfume thieves. They have a kind of incense that makes you faint when you smell it. They have committed two cases in Xingzi County and even killed someone!"</p>
<p>We few young partners were all stunned. As if we saw those two pairs of glowing, terrible eyes, we felt that there was an atmosphere of terror in the mountains and fields. Our bodies were soaked in sweat again, but it was a cold sweat. (Note: Jiangxi people commonly refer to strangers)</p>
<h3 id="e263">Trunk <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Leon</p>
<p>"The 28th... Today is the 19th... Tomorrow is the 20th, the day after tomorrow the 21st, the day after that the 22nd, 23rd, 24th... only nine days from beginning to end!" Little Gendi calculated in her heart almost every day. She always felt dissatisfied, having toiled through wind, frost, rain, and snow since she was small. At eleven years old, the day of her marriage was only nine days away. But her mother still urged her to work every day, still wore that same ramie cloth shirt, still piled her hair on her head like a bird's nest, nothing had changed.</p>
<p>Her mother and father seemed to have forgotten about Little Gendi's wedding, each busy with their own work every day. How resentful she felt.</p>
<p>In front of the sock knitting machine, Little Gendi kept thinking:</p>
<p>What are Mom and Dad really thinking? If they don't want to marry their daughter off, why did they accept the betrothal gifts so early? Now they've spent the other family's money and act as if nothing happened. It's simply too muddled. Even if the dowry isn't anything grand, there should at least be a few small pieces of furniture, some seasonal clothes... and two trunks. When the day comes, do they expect me to go empty-handed to their house?" Heavy thoughts weighed her down, and her work suffered.</p>
<p>She returned home with a tired body and an unhappy mood. The matchmaker, Wang, was sitting on her mother's bed, discussing something with her. She didn't dare to brazenly go closer, or her father would scold her for being "shameless." While stoking the stove and stewing porridge, she eavesdropped on her mother and Wang's conversation. They were discussing the matter of trunks. How stingy her mother was, completely refusing the three trunks that Wang had requested. She even said things like, "If they take my daughter away so early, who will subsidize our old couple's expenses every month? We'll have to work our old bones to the bone. I can't afford to buy this and that." That night, the matchmaker, Wang, left unhappily.</p>
<p>"Mom, could it be that not even one... one... trunk... will be taken over there? They spent money too... How will I face them in the future..." Little Gendi couldn't bear it any longer and said to her mother.</p>
<p>These words, however, pricked her father's anger like needles: "Shameless, shameless! You still mention money? Wasn't that money used up by you two little devils when you caught the plague? One died, and you, this living treasure, were left, and now you're going to be splashed away like water. I raised you, hoping to rely on you for a few days, but damn it, it's all in vain. You want to put on a show, but you chose the wrong life. Don't you know your parents are poor!"</p>
<p>After a scolding, Little Gendi sat by the stove, sobbing.</p>
<p>Her mother, after all, loved her daughter. (And her father didn't not love his daughter; it was just that their poor life was too ruthless.) Little Gendi heard her mother's loving voice: "Forgive your poor mom and dad. Who isn't strained by money? Fortunately, Gendi, a person has their fate determined. Your destiny is set. In the future, not to mention trunks, even a large wardrobe will be easy to come by. Your fate is set to be bitter. Even if you have gold, silver, pearls, and treasures now, they will all be used up and gone. Once you go over there, as long as your husband is well-behaved and you yourself are frugal and hardworking, trunks will be easy to get..."</p>
<p>Little Gendi slightly suppressed her sadness, looking at her mother with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>"But, you must understand that your dad isn't such a heartless person. He knows you've been working since you were small, helping the family survive. He just doesn't have money, and besides, when you go to their house, the family's expenses will be even more... His temper is getting worse and worse..." Four streams of tears fell together...</p>
<h3 id="e264">Window <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>Across from my room is a window, a small window, separated by a small alley.</p>
<p>The distance between our two windows is only about half a zhang. At night, when the lights in the surrounding houses are all extinguished, the tangerine-yellow light from the window across the way seems particularly warm. I love that window; it's like a riddle, giving me many insights: How fleeting life is!</p>
<p>When I first moved in, I started to notice that window. It was so intimate! From that small window opening, I saw the face of a kind mother, holding a baby less than a year old in her arms. The low lullaby put her son to sleep and also mesmerized me. A traveler who had lost his mother's caresses received motherly love from here.</p>
<p>However, soon after, at night, that window was buried in the boundless darkness, with no shadow and no sound, as desolate as an ancient tomb. The unbearable loneliness struck me. So, I often closed my own window and added a layer of white cloth. Although the room was stuffy, I felt at ease. I feared that window, I feared that boundless darkness.</p>
<p>Not long after, a foreign little girl's pale face appeared in the window across the way. She often leaned against the window, gazing at me with her blue eyes. Her father was a drunkard all day long, his body as dirty as a loach just pulled out of the mud, his disheveled beard, his hoarse voice, made me feel that he was a down-and-out person. At midnight, that window was still bright and open, with the sounds of sobs and curses flowing over from time to time.</p>
<p>A month later, this family hurriedly moved away again. I saw the man carrying a broken box in his hand, the woman carrying a bundle of odds and ends on her back. And then that little girl's face became blurred, as if I had seen it only in a dream.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else will move in soon! Perhaps my tearful eyes will see some strange aspects of the world again! I must thank this window; it allows me to see the various faces of human life. Life, how bizarre and ever-changing! As if chasing after something. People come and go in a hurry. Where are they ultimately going? These untiring travelers of life!</p>

Pitiful are some innocent Buddhas, suffering and being tormented in prison. Some are oppressed, some are instigated, living locked in this prison. Whose voice will speak of your dull pain? In bitterness, you hold grievances; whose voice will explain for you? To live is to betray the joy of life, forever unable to wash away wrongs and mistakes. To die! You leave behind wives, children, and parents, full of sorrow, with no one to entrust your words to. Shameful human demons, pitiful human Buddhas, one day will destroy the world.</p>
