<p>時評</p>
<h3>論大赦政治犯</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>二十三日立法院院長孫科自廬山返京後對中央社記者發表談話。中有一段說及大赦政治犯問題。謂「馮煥章先生曾有此項建議。蔣委員長在粵黨政軍人員宣誓就職典禮中亦曾提及。中央仍本寬大為懷之旨。對有功革命之政治犯。行使大赦。予若輩以自新之路。當可减少反動之集體力量。」我們民衆聽到了這個消息。感覺到無限的欣喜。希望政府能够早日擬定具體辦法。見諸實行。</p>
<p>就純粹政治學上的立塲說。一個國家之有政治犯的存在。本是一種不好的現象。因為政治犯的形成。是表示這個國家的政治還未曾走上軌道。得到全民的擁戴。所以在政治此較淸明的國家。像英美等國是不大聽到說起政治犯的。一個政府之所以要拘禁政治犯。為的是在防止他們推翻現行政制。這大多是在緊急狀態下行之的。但到了緊急的形勢已經過去。政府的地位重新獲得鞏固的基礎後。則多舉行大赦政治犯。這在各國的歷史上可以找出許多的事實。所以大赦政治犯的實行。實可表示一個國家的中央政權已臻鞏固。而不再怕政敵的企圖推翻了。</p>
<p>上面是就大赦政治犯問題的一般方面說的。而在目前的中國環境之下。大赦政治犯尤含有重大的意義。我國自從九一八事變以後。國難是一天嚴重一天。在侵略者得寸進尺的積極進攻下。我們整個民族如再不聯合所有的力量去謀抵抗。那總不免要有滅亡的一天。過去的事實已經給我們極可寳貴的敎訓。現在中央政府擬大赦政治犯。實於中國民族解放的前途。有極重大的意義。因為這些政治犯非一般普通犯人可比。他們的聰明才智。都比較優越。現在如蒙中央政府予以大赦。得以積極參加救亡運動。那末中國民族的解放。必更有光明的前途了。</p>
<p>有些人以為政治犯赦免後恐怕仍要同政府作對。這似不免失之過慮。因為在中國現狀下赦免政治犯的主要動機。是在集中救亡的力量。在這個大目標下。各黨各派的勢力都已經合流為一。一切內部的糾紛。都要消除。要是有一個人離開這個大目標。那它就已成了漢奸。而不復是政治犯了。我們民衆聽到中央要大赦政治犯。覺得非常高與。因為這是集中全國力量去抵抗侵略者的一個重要步驟。希望政府能早日擬就具體辦法。施之實行。我們不但希望政府赦免沒有黨派關係的政治犯。而且希望政府能赦免有黨派關係的政治犯。我們不但希望政府能赦免「現行的政治犯。」而且更希望政府要赦免「未來的政治犯。」祗有這樣。全國的救國力量才能集中起來。民族解放的前途才有勝利的把握。</p>
<h3>日對華外交政策　一元化已獲得若干成功　預料川越為中日談判中心人物　解决冀省經濟問題及其他懸案</h3>
<p>（東京）聞日本對華政策、經川越大使及陸海外三省特派員之解釋後、長春高級參謀及各地武官之天津會議、已成立與東京相同之决議、川越將採取適當的外交程序、進而解决冀省經濟問題及其他懸案、冀省經濟開拓、原則上係採用中日共同經營之方式、而取得南京當局之許可、日本對華外交政策之一元化、迄今似已獲得若干成功、預料中日談判開始時、日方將以川越大使為中心人物、同時其他日本代表、將從事於側面工作、日本所持建議之具體內容、雖尙未悉、但其範圍之廣大、則可以想像得之也、（二十四日中央社電）</p>

<h3>世運足球隊歐遊記</h3>

<p>抵喀爾咭打</p>
<p>我隊六月三十日上午乘英郵『阿朗打』aronda號離仰光、爾畫夜的航程、使隊中長浪者大感不歡、終程與短榻作伴侶、在這『風颶季』中、這一帶的航路、都有點使人害怕、却倒便宜了輪船公司、省下不少的福食、七月二日淸晨倚欄下望、海水漸變黃色、詢舟中人則云已近印度之『鏡子』河口、而舟行平穩、無復顚動、暈船者亦霍然以興、爭入餐室、八時半入河、兩岸林田、一望無際、聞循此河道駛入、尚需六七十海里始抵喀爾咭打也、午餐甫畢喀城已遙遙在望、岸上佇候歡迎者數百人、陳梁領帶僑商領袖、及印度足球總會會長職員等多人、且登輪殷殷與吾人握手、紛紛問訊、熱情可感、登陸後、乘車環遊全市一週、始遄赴『大華飯店』下塌、按喀爾咭打不特為印度最大城巿、卽在遠東一帶、其幅頁之遼闊、人口之稠密、亦算首屈一指、剎那間的印象、雖因所見不多、但最深刻的是這裏也有三不少、人不少、車不少、牛不少、街上行人有時眞肩摩踵接、車輛全城逾七萬部、其熱鬧市區、常有交通梗塞之患、而最使人驚寄的、便是無論通衢大道上、或熱鬧塲所及大商店門前、常可看見一兩頭的黃牛、躑躅其間、無拘無束、縱使牠們是阻塞着交通、警察及行人也不加以干涉、讓其自由行走、聽說這裏的佛敎徒、不食牛肉、且奉之為神、每年都有放生之舉、所以全城處處都有牛跡、這也可算是別開生面的見聞了、</p>
<p>（七月二日）上午無事、中飯後承此間僑團聯合茶會歡迎、並邀歐印人士作陪、席間各人演說、均陳述中印兩古國暦史、典文化之密切關係、末由容博士答謝感意、下午五時半、往觀此間甲組循環賽、此賽關係本年錦標、故其熱鬧、一時無兩、吾人車未抵塲、遙遙已見萬頭鑽動、塲內看臺以木製、（因塲地為陸軍塲所、不許有永久建築物、）不能多容觀衆、擠極亦不過納二萬人左右、但此地足球熱、熟冠遠東、塲外斜坡觀衆、無慮七八萬、人如蟻緊、又如疊羅漢、六屆全運足球决賽時之鹽况、尚不可及、吾隊南遊以還、所至各地、觀衆均破當地紀錄、但今日之熱鬧、實為前所未見、眞足使吾人橋舌張目也、尤新穎者、塲外觀衆之在後排而不能得窺全豹者、均手提木架具、上置小鏡向塲中、共下復懸一鏡向上微斜、塲內比賽情景、山反映而畢現於下方鏡上、持鏡者遂盤膝以坐、如觀電影於銀幕、優哉樂哉、與人無爭、這小小玩意兒、也是一點新見識這裏小常球賽、因天氣過熱、僅賽五十分、（少五分半塲）印屬球員多跣足應戰、其敏捷處如小鹿奔馳、得利不少、惟有時遇穿靴者相撞時、也有點吃虧、世事無兩利、於茲更信、此間球藝、半均程度甚高、短長傳遷、均有相當準蠅、尤以短傳為佳妙、但射門術、尚欠功夫、頭球亦非高明、總之、今日觀察所得、印度足球尚覺可人、雖看不出有特殊傑出之輩、但個個都中上之材、吾隊明日與其精銳相見、實未可樂觀也、</p>
<p>中印大戰</p>
<p>（七月四日）今日為中印國際大比賽之期、此項國際接觸、實為　矢、聞入塲券旬日前巳沽淸、投機者且有倍其値、或三四倍其値、將券着價而沽、可見斯賽之能引人入勝也、是日天氣晴明、紅日高照、午餐畢、自吾人旅舍遙遙下瞰、旣見觀業爭先恐後、絡繹途中、計距開賽時尚五六小時、而迷民竟因地盤優劣關係、不顧辛苦、寗在烈日下擎傘以待、是眞一等球迷也、五時半吾隊驅車進塲、觀衆遍野、不得其門而入者不可勝計、其熱鬧情况、聞開空前紀錄、音樂奏畢、吾隊以左列十一人、登塲應戰、上半時一比〇、結果一比一、立功者錦順、</p>

<p>陳鎭和　徐亞輝　梁榮照</p>
<p>鄭季良　譚江柏　李惠堂　孫錦順　楊水益</p>
<p>稍練脚等後、乃排隊看臺前、與足球總會長某印度王子握手行禮、體畢開球、對方十九赤足、在今日塲地乾硬之上、佔得無限便宜、吾人自賽球以來、從未遇敵跣足以賽者、今日破題兒、接觸之下、便有特殊感覺、又怪又趣、不可形述、彼方管球有方、盤傳均臻佳妙、我方徐亞輝病後新瘥、不出賽已半月、今日再復登塲、氣力較差、榮照地位又劣、中右兩路、遂屢為敵所侵、前鋒表演、季良江柏最失常態、江柏連頭球亦無所施技、牽動全綫、上半時錦頤奏功、以一比零佔先、下半時印隊攻勢益燨、我隊被圍而陷於危者屢、幸彼輩射門乏術、不致有失、終塲前、紹漢奪球被罰十二碼、遂以一比一平分秋色、和局以散、事後各方評論、均認此罰球為不當、總之、今日之賽、我隊並無驚人表露、全隊除家平天生鎭和及惠堂能保持常熊外、餘子均遠不及週前在仰光時措施乏佳妙、襯衆過多怯塲歟、天氣過熱有關歟、</p>

<p>標紗　市開盤、因八月期紗僅剩明天日營業、一般浮多鑒於棉產豐收、棉價看跌、對於棉紗無意收貨、因此市態愈見衰弱、各月直綫下瀉、同時現紗生意停滯、人必更挫、市價步開步落、各月　　破進二百元關門、大孚愃益愼記　豐努力　出、大昶興昌森康德大麟進、亦屬可觀、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二元四角至一元六角、午後區盤、本月仍　、拍至遠期　昂、　盤以後、市　蜀帮仍有交易等說、空頭抵進、後三個月復出二百元關外、詎料收盤各月一致下降、且跌風陡興、結果各月比上午收盤漲一元四·六角、市塲交易發遠、上午拍至一點一刻收盤、午後延長三時開盤、至六時多遂收盤、足見投機商必思之在熱也、查費出大孚晨賣午買、通記三千包、恒益六千二百包、聚與五千一百五十包、愼記二千四百五十包、仁　一千一百五十包、大昌成一千二百五十包、長豐三千六百五十包、經華一千二百五十包、達記三千六百五十包、協成一千七百包、買進勝暨五千四百五十包、興昌三千五百五十包、森康一千八百五十包、大昶三千八百包、生源一千〇五十包、泰昌一千八百包、一日間最高低價列下、</p>
<p>現紗亦跌一二元</p>
<p>現紗銷路平平、查全日各帮買去統計九百二十七元、售價跌一·二元不等、各帮買額列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　現銷岑寂　本月粉多頭出籠　一瀉五分餘之鉅</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、已恢復常例、上午開盤後、以洋麥芝加哥近小角外、遠好數分、坎拿大漲一角左右、國外無所借鏡、而現麥市氣已龍萎頓、粉銷亦處岑寂、且本月交易、停止在卽、已鮮廻旋餘地、巨戶及零整多頭、相繼出籠、遠月新空、聞風興起、故巿盤步開步跌、一貫下游之局、迨下午收盤、內地廠遠期略有收進、尾勢始轉穩定、結果較週末收盤、本月跌五分二厘半、九月十一月各小四分、十月份小三分七厘半、十二月份小二一分、一月份小二分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>現貨商紛起套售　期麥步步下降　十月份竟跌一角</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、以現貨廠胃轉懈、中次麥貶抑尤甚、而本月份交割之期、瞬息卽屆、一般行商鑒於新貨以來、交解之品、均為中駟之材、收貨心思、益形淡泊、故上午開盤後、多頭紛紛回出、而現貨商套售、亦接踵以起、致午前局勢、步步下降、近遠期跌六分至九分不等、惟洋麥報訊、尚見平靜而跌勢已屬不弱、午後浮空坻補、乘機人手、形勢漸趨和綏、因此下午僅盤旋於一二分之間、以成始跌終定之局也、綜計全日價格、較上週六牧盤、八月份小四分、十月份跌一角、十一月份小九分、九月十二月一目均小八分、現麥因廠方出路不暢、納胃略懈、價格略思扣緊、行販則不願降格、故暫成擯局、全日隻包未交云</p>
<h3>揚州新芝蔴上巿　新黃豆因傳日商搜辦飛俏</h3>
<p>昨日揚州新芝蔴巳運到二百餘包、因貨品低次、本街揀去七十一包、價開九元四角、今庚出品比較客歲大遜、身份祇八三四、良以雨水過多、致身色均受影響、年成尚未可實測、聞大約六七成之譜、津沛路大帮新貨須在中秋節左右登塲、洋莊新芝蔴拋盤交易、昨見擯持、大勢十三元之價賣買均取守勢、故無成交、新黃豆因盛傳日商在九江搜辦、致本市貨戶據俏、市塲中人心失常、榨油廠放價採辦、所以行情頓漲二角外、成交江橋豆二千餘包、本街走銷常州牛皮黃一千四百餘包、及二陽豆二百餘包、珠溪　五　包、陳豆濺家辦去四平街豆堿車、行情比前市漲一角六七分云、</p>
<h3>食米行巿均屬平疲　客秈到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到十穴七號、貨共三千餘石、客銷依然不佳、包胃靑鳥帮亦　辦四五百包、故市况呈高定中疲之局、厚早粳及薄稻行情除高貨無所榮辱外、中次悉小幾分、杜洋尖及陰變元均尚平穩、東新共到有一千餘石、惟去路見遜、價跌一角、</p>

<p>（客秈）昨前客秈到頭甚旺、尤以長江上游到貨更多、兩日間新到共計三萬多包、而紗巿漢口到數占三分之二、日來客化雖旺、終以新米到數過多、行情仍被壓小數分至角許不一、昨本客去化均活、北洋帮辦去湘靖二千五百包、粤帮辦去糙六七千包、其他均係本街辦去、散帮點綴有限、因各地新米相繼上市、內地帮已乏胃口矣、全日開出江西米二千包、湘米三千九百包、溫台米六百包、渶糙八千多包、</p>
<h3>疋頭棉布惟花色貨尚穩</h3>
<p>昨棉布受國內棉產估計增牧、外棉及標紗花一致疲落影響、市面步趨下游、白貨首當其衝、日廠貨各牌細布細斜·粗布·粗斜·市布·八四原布均粉紛下跌、每疋跌自五分至一角不等、本廠貨粗斜粗布售盤尚穩、細布細斜每疋略回五分之譜、惟中外各廠花色貨花素直貢·囉嘰·色丁·印花絨·需要仍旺、售盤平定、客帮西北陝省添貨漸增、天氣雖亢旱、與棉產影響尚微、川湘滇等區花色貨亦仍活動、致各廠出品均不敷交解、粤桂受時局影響、銷胃大减、北路烟津濟南辦綫呢·粗布·印花直貢·嗶嘰·仍夥、內地帮對於白貨輕磅粗布·本廠細斜·色貨綫呢·花色直貢·嗶嘰·添辦漸濃、</p>
<h3>西貨直貢搜羅甚殷</h3>
<p>普通元靑直貢呢、自長沙帮及渝蓉帮旺辦以來、申市內外棧存底大缺、東西貨一律升漲、尤以西貨五元零者一檔貨色、尤為俏俐、行號方面大半均已搜羅殆盡、蓋新貨一無進口、日貨五五九須售五元光景、致客方統皆需辦西洋貨、昨順全隆太師少師及德記四孝園與禮和鬧天宮等普通五元上下元直貢呢、統已售罄斷檔、趨勢之俏、可與波蘭貨呢媲美矣、昨國貨章華元直貢呢、齊售四元五角、阿部市伊藤三井之司馬相如售四元九角半、安利聚寶盆七元七角、公益金實塔六元六角、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲巿甚感沉悶</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市無市、橫濱現貨維持原價、期貨趨勢鬆疲、里昂絲價不動、國外市塲空氣、甚感沉悶、國內用戶亦乏生氣、昨日僅白頭行家、略有成交、此外白廠及山東經交易、亦殊淸淡、</p>
<h3>平水大帮交易暢達</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶市况、略見活潑、英·美·法·賤等莊、對於各路綠茶、均有去化、其中平水大帮一項、交易最旺、成交八千六百餘箱、頂盤出四十一元七角五分、尚稱穩定、至路莊土莊珍眉珠茶、市面亦較前起色、惟珍眉售價趨軟、珠茶巿盤　硬、形勢依然堅軟不一云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業公會報告云、昨綠茶續有零星交易、協和辦珍眉二百餘箱、計四大名家百零四元、屯珍七十一元、寶隆進徽珍二百餘箱、價五十八元至六十元、福時華茶各進百餘箱、價六十至七十元、永興亦有少數辦入、小針眉協和又進六百餘箱、價二十五至　十八元、又恊助會自緣茶市開辦以來、有一二次貢熙交易、昨續有三十二箱、成交價一百元、平水另色珠茶、同孚辦四百餘箱、價五十七元、大帮交易較為淸淡云、</p>
<h3>糖巿期貨東白開價鬆動　—連日共達五萬包弱—</h3>
<p>昨糖市以連日東白期貨暗盤開出四萬餘包價亦較廉、巿勢轉軟、昨天里廠續開四千包、計（J）　六元一角半、（N）　五元九角半、SH　五元七角半、因此公會劃盤亦不振、二四粗砂白現六元六角半成交、東白四號現二十一元三角、轉口六元三角、八號現貨二十一元一角三分、轉口六元一角、均小角許、九號呌原價、金心大華本廠綿白一號貨、昨由招商局泰順輪運往連雲港二千餘包、又海南赤數百包、號盤有洋行街某行開出海南赤千餘包、價為十二元五角至六角、旋由天津帮如數辦入、價雖回跌、市勢尚俏、又潮帮開出靑獅赤八十餘包、十五元四角、比前徵鬆、荷粗砂白昨由芝尼加拿輪運到一萬七千五百包、</p>

<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝號盤步緊　海南圓肉到多價跌</h3>
<p>海南圓肉　昨日四川山東兩輪入口、到貨漸多、兼之廣州元肉連日開跌、人心下游、行盤遂　　　、前開五　、三元之貨、昨　出　跌進五十元大關、故預料今日號盤恐難望好、</p>
<p>蘭竹枝　近因到存軋缺、號盤步聚、巳達三十元、比首市尚升角許、聞太原　本定昨日人口、但至晚未到、大約中途為遇風遲延、據云此次到數必增、貨主意思頗高、紛紛電巾要求加漲、須守三十五元云、</p>
<h3>五金　東白鐵傾銷四川</h3>
<p>東白鐵自本埠中山·亞細亞兩廠（日商）成立後、出貨每日達一萬張光景、本埠廠家建築帮等銷塲每日祗有四千張左右、故代理經銷之商號、竭力設法推廣內河長江一帶、但每日平均銷路亦祗三千張之　、遞來日商注意於四川帮生意、故每張行情四川帮買賣、又特別低廉、二分之譜、因此運日川銷大坳、日有七八千張裝往、惟行情如七尺沽一元左右、六尺在八角一二分之譜、其代理商號每張可扣二三分佣金、因此英　比德諸貨銷路、受其影壽匪淺矣、</p>

<h3>女人與夜</h3>
<p>— （周賢）</p>
<p>女人與夜，似乎是不可分離的。夜而沒有女人點綴着，便　着是寂寞而悽凍，女人而不在夜間活動着，便也似乎　不出女人的神秘。</p>
<p>自然在淸早，在白天，我們這個社會中，也償有不少女人，在活動着。但那　文人，有的是女工，有的是　　，還有的，是其他各種以勞力換取生活的女人。可是夜幕展開着，而範罩上大地時，生活的哀號，是給一團歡愉的氣氛蓋住了。在夜的領域中，所有的，只是女人與笑，或是說笑的女人。</p>
<p>弓弦在胡琴絃上跳動着，尖銳而淸越的嗓音，伴着胡琴聲，從大酒樓裏，從大飯店裏，從像公館也似的甚麽　寓裏，傳出來。跟着，是一陣子哈哈的大笑。笨拙的，是男人的笑聲。尖銳的，是女人的笑聲。在幽靈也似的燈光下，在華兩次的樂調中，笑着的男人，擁着笑着的女人，踏着輕鬆的步子，是那麽的閒適。在遊戲塲裏，男人儘對着女人擠眉，女人也儘對着男人弄眼在那裏，凡是女人，都是那麽的神秘。在按摩院裏，更有的是年輕而貌美的姑娘。還有，是作着穢褻而有傷風化的行為的女人，幹着不可思議的工作，以博取男人們的笑樂。最普通的自然是站在街頭的神女，在黯淡的燈光之下，用不自然的笑臉，放射着神秘的誘力。</p>
<p>女人為甚麽要在夜裏活動，我想，或許是可以在燈光下，藏過着粉與胭脂之下，所掩蔽着的生活的鞭韃之痕吧？但是我們的夜，在實際上，也幸而有着女人，才是那麽的神秘，否則我們這個社會，也眞是太寂寞了！</p>
<h3>回力球塲之夜</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>五光十色的霓虹燈，照射着一條橫式的anditorium英文照牌，進出口處擠滿着紳士式的大亨，西裝革履的公子，奇裝艷服的小姐，油頭滑腦的流氓……守門的阿三，不斷的嚷着：「派司！派司！」於是一大批人被吞進去，接着又吐出一大批人。</p>
<p>偉大的建築，明亮的電炬，使人忘記了黑夜；奢侈，浮華，燈裏似乎是出產地，同時也是消磨民族志氣的塲所，然而人們為了滿足某種慾望，所以都不顧自己的存亡而趨之若驚呵！</p>
<p>當人們坐定之後，那很大的鐵絲網裏，走進幾個球員，穿着紅黃綠的運動制服，先由一個穿西裝者，吹了一聲口笛後，便算一個是簡單的開球禮，球員便開始比賽了。一隻似鴨蛋般的木球，來來去去跳躍着，怪有秩序的。這倒不能不佩服歐美人的運動手段高妙！一次完畢，那高處懸的球員姓氏下的記數牌，隨着勝負而更動。於是觀衆也開始騷動起來，售票處的鈔票如在蝶般飛舞；二元，五元，十元，二十元，三十元……人像瘋了似的，忘了血汗換來的錢，忘記了一切，甚至忘了自身。</p>
<p>「噓……噓……噓……」一聲號令，宣吿一塲完了。人們的心都在忑忐的跳着，但明瞭自己失望時，却又萬分的憤恨了，也有在笑，在樂的，但畢竟是少數！</p>
<p>不久二塲又開始，觀衆更瘋在啦！因為「失敗是成功之母。」他們很服膺道句名言的！聽瘋在之聲吧！</p>
<p>「喂！來一張卡禮加，二張楚曼地！」</p>
<p>「來二張畢爾保，二張依思高！」</p>
<p>結果却是亞函培地。他們除了念着「觸霉頭」外，仍舊這樣循環着下去，十二時，一時……但是他們的精神，反比辦公還要振作，還有興趣。如果世界上沒有時計的話，我相信他們必定以為沒有畫夜之分的。</p>
<p>據一個熱悉此道者談，這裏每晚的收入，至少在五六千元左右，而其中一半為我國人所報效。雖然也有人說：「中國是貧窮極了。」</p>
<h3>文廟公園之夜</h3>
<p>— 姚明然</p>
<p>當驕陽收歛了它的火燄，夜風送爽的時光：是岌夜的文廟，最熱鬧的關頭，流水般的人潮，淌得平時寂寞的文廟路，如同南京路一樣！</p>
<p>管門的警士，沒法兒控制這大隊的人馬，進得大門，反覺得熱氣飛騰，環顧四周，都擠滿了黑簇簇的人羣，坐也有，立也有，打瞌睡啊！談天說地啊！大成門是凉風送爽的要塞，吸引得貪凉羣衆，像便衣隊般，取包圍式的散兵綫，來鞏固他們的崗位！</p>
<p>斥堠般的走出了人羣，好容易達到了大成殿的階前，熱的空氣，雖有幾枝搖曳的樹木，在替我們驅除，但是怎能抵抗得一乾二凈呢？那里有茶博士，布爾喬亞，普羅階級，包圍在階的四周，絕如屛風一般！</p>
<p>路是愈難走了！偷偷地慢步到市圖書館那邊，那館前池塘裏的野荷葉，很靜的亭亭玉立着，幾聲金絲蛙的淸唱，也够得玻熱神所窒息着的羣衆，透過氣來！因了清越的關係，所以也吸引着不少的羣衆，中間有一個患着歇斯蒂里亞病樣的昂起頭來在笑了回，引得旁人對他側目，幾十條視綫集中了他的面龐，掃射得他不好意思，轉身溜去！再下去，便是冠生園的營業部，燦爛的燈光，照得全室通明，轉搖的電風扇，忙了不停，月亮高高的照着，瑩潔的顆顆明星，浴在河裏，反射出雪白的銀光，同時水際的螢火蟲，一閃一爍的點緩着夏夜的文廟！</p>
<p>九點鐘了，催回的鐘聲高聲警吿你，辭別了岌夜的文廟，螢光，蛙聲，盤旋在我的腦海，做我歸途中的精神上的伴侶。</p>
<h3>半淞園之夜</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>南車站的半淞園，在最近的三年之中，到了夏天，照例要開放夜花園的。而今年的夜花園，早又開放了除了平時的各種點綴外，特地請丁婉娥在四面廳唱申曲，空地上放映露天電影，星期三，六，日，這三天還有放燄火的玩意。</p>
<p>是一個星期六的夜晚，好奇的我，特地到半淞園去，想領略這園子的夜色。當我到達牛淞園的時候，的莫在傍晚七時，雲飛汽車，祥生汽車，一輛輛的載了遊園客，送到半淞園的門口。半淞園的裏面，這時已燈火齊明，換上一重夜景了。</p>
<p>當我走進園子，經過曲折的泥路的時候，祇見綠樹的中間，到處裝着電燈，反映出一種青綠的光色，覺得這園子是更見幽靜了。那些躱在樹葉子下的夏蟬，以為燈光是太陽光，錯認了夜晚是白天，所以又很高興的在臨風歌唱起來。</p>
<p>一時的高興，爬上一個最高的土邱，坐在茅亭裏面，舉目四望，祗是一片黑魆魆了，什麽都看不見，祗是偶然可從樹枝的中間瞥見一星兩星的燈光。凉風一陣陣的吹來，着到我身上，使得我遍體覺得凉爽，忘却白天坐在家裏時的苦熱。</p>
<p>那個池子的裏面，記得去年在湖心亭的前面探出一個三潭印月，可是今年吧，在湖心亭的對面，紮了一座嘉興的烟雨樓。沿湖一帶，電燈光倒映入水，立刻會使你聯想到西子湖濱的夜色。划子船在水面輕輕的浮動着，遊客們一時高興，在黑暗中還會唱起歌曲來。</p>
<p>在這裏，有情男情女在曲徑中喁喁私話，有高貴的紳士率領妻女子媳而飽遊夜園，男女工人，也釗這園子裏來吐一口氣，恢復白天工作的疲勞，遊園的人的確不少呢！</p>
<p>據說燄火要等到十一時半才放，我獨個子在園子裏兜了幾個圈子，委實等不及，祗有犧牲掉不看，當我走出去的時候，又發現了江上草堂裏面，有文虎的玩意，而那個荷花池內，荷花已開放，一池荷葉，肥大的難得看見。出園門後，仍打原路回去。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　錦喜字重來聲題翠葉　嫁衣驚乍試淚濕絞綃</p>
<p>他走到臉盆架邊去，要伸手到臉盆裏去洗臉，這才發覺到自己手上還盒着茶盃呢。於是放下茶盃，自已也哈哈大笑起來。劉媽追到屋子裏來，問他什麽事時，他已是忽忽的漱洗完了，連茶也不喝，收起了信同畫，忽忽就向外走。原來他的意思，是想在路上見着了夢蘭，和他道謝，也許彼此就有接言的機會了。可是他這個計畫，那是不對的。在這個日子，夢蘭正是感着大難的將臨，心灰意懶，什麽都感不到興趣，慢說是用心讀書了。這時，他起牀以後，正坐在窗戶裏的書桌邊，對了隔壁的兩棵高大柳樹出神。小菊站在房門口，用手連連敲着房門。夢蘭回轉頭來看時，見他手上捧了一隻花布包袱，兩手高舉過頭，笑道：小姐，你試試作的新衣服，全拿來了。夢蘭站起，將包袱接過，覺得裏面，根厚很厚，而且有相當的重。便道：我不是要做一件青緞夾襖嗎？怎麽這樣的多。小菊笑道：這裏面的衣服好看着哩。夢蘭這倒透着有點奇怪，把包袱放在床上，打開來看，首先便是一種鮮紅的顏色，射到了眼裏。正是一件水紅綢的夾襖，又用大紅緞子滾着邊的。這就不必向下看下面所折疊的，正是一條水紅綢的裙子。便扳了臉向小菊道：道是誰敎你拿來的。是我的衣服嗎？小菊見他微睜了兩眼，兩腮紅紅的，便將一個食指，放到嘴裏，倒退了幾步，低了頭抬不起來。夢蘭指着包袱道！多重的東西。你給拿來了，你就得拿走。你不拿走，我要打你了。小菊一見事情不妙，扭轉身子，就向樓下跑了去。夢蘭他不敢向床上的包袱望着，拿了一本書，放在桌子上，有意無意的看着。却聽到身後有了很從容的脚步走了過來。自己料着這又是小菊來了，這僩孩子，喜歡多一事，越理會他，他就越要胡鬧了。兩眼更釘了書本子上，身以外什麽事全不管了。這時，自己的肩膀上，却有一隻手，悄悄的按住着。便將肩膀一歪道：人家心裏正不好過，不要再來麻煩我了。說着，一扭頭，却看到自己的母親，帶了微微的笑容，站在椅子邊。夢蘭立刻站起來，笑道：媽也到我屋子裏來了。江太太笑道。你又發那小孩子脾氣了。是我要小菊子把包袱拿上樓的。你要怪他，那就怪我得了。夢蘭直道：我也　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　你不是　　我不喜</p>

<h3>愛多亞路之夜</h3>
<p>— 晨曦</p>
<p>愛多亞路之夜，組織在都市色情文化的上面</p>
<p>在霓虹的光芒下，「紅錫包會烟」的大時針還沒有跳過12以前；這裏有成千成萬的人羣　蠢動着。大世界的週遭，　蕩着夜鶯的影子，笙歌的繁突；跟着流動的空氣播散着。</p>
<p>在東新橋到大世界的一段路上，　裏徜徉着或行走着的女人，在粗糙的皮膚上，塗上白色的鉛粉，伊們類多是靈現的出賣者。在色情文化的社會組織下，一般中資階級式無產階級者肉的偶像</p>
<p>像　蕩着的夜鶯，雉妓，尚白，玻璃盃，白　人嫂嫂，伊們在生的皮鞭下掙扎着，同樣造成許多色情文化下畸形的人。當夜幕拉攏了的時候，這些骷髏的跳舞，在這亘長的愛多亞路上，當霓虹的燈光映紅了半片天的時候。</p>
<p>朱葆三路的口頭，　裏有許多『BAR』或『CAFE』的霓虹燈在跳躍着。在夜色朦朧中，這裏有戴着白色的水手帽，穿着燈籠褲的異國水兵，或者戴着紅頂子的法蘭西水兵，他們都是黃浦江或殖民地的浪跡者。搖着醉漢樣的影子，哼着流浪者的歌曲。</p>
<p>肥大的臂膊，肥大的腿肚白俄的貴族婦女，細長的身材，烏油油的頭髪，在白色香粉裏泛出淡黃的種族色的中國小姐，播散着麝香的濃烈，在這夜的愛多亞路上。聽着爵士的彈奏，對着這許多芳香的陣營；把許多流浪者的心旌都動搖了！</p>
<p>愛多亞路之夜，組織在都市色情文化的上面。</p>
<h3>幽美的霞飛路之夜</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>幽美的震飛路之夜，像一首美麗的散文詩，像一幅法國的沙龍畫，更如一個玄妙的夢境。這裏我相信如果有一位浪漫派的詩人，或新感派的散文家，甚至是象徵派的藝術家住着的話，那一定會有一篇或一幅偉大的成功作品可以給我們鑒賞的。</p>
<p>秋夜的霞飛路上，它有着處子般的靜趣，少婦般的溫柔，也有賣淫女那般的在放，流浪者那般的感傷。尤其是剛剛黃昏以後，和幾個朋友在這見散着步，看着一列遼遠的，閑爍不定的街燈，彷彿似一串漫長的珠子。假使從霞飛路的這端，望到霞飛路的那端，中間一條炫耀的燈光，會具有那樣撩惑人的意味。甚至使人會疑心已置身巴黎而忘記了自己却還在故國！</p>
<p>霞飛路是富於法國情調的，我們只要看到那街道的整齊，和商店的風格，櫥窗的陳列，就很少能够見到一處中國意味來。</p>
<p>在上海許多馬路當中，霞飛路是和北四川路同樣的具有一種神秘色彩的；這條充滿着異國情調的馬路，直得像一支馬鞭，由八仙橋到善鐘路止，這末長的一段路程，寬平得像一條靜止的河流，垂直得沒有一點兒彎曲。兩傍人行道上種着法國梧桐，像待受檢閱的軍隊似的排列着，一種嚴肅整齊的神氣，令人望而興奮。</p>
<p>那些俄國菜館與酒排間，常常有許多怪誕浪漫的故事潑生；——每至深夜人靜，一般商店公司都關門了，而這時的俄國菜館和酒排間裏却正是開始熱鬧的時候。</p>
<p>法租界是一般白俄的生活寄託處，他們男的是終年在街頭流浪着，女的除了以肉體笑　以博生活外，也作傭工以度日。他們雖然也有祖國，然而祖國已經增他們遺忘了，他們雖然也有家，可是他們已不能回到自己的家裏去。他們只有亡命在異鄉，永遠地度着慘悽的流浪生涯；因此，在這寂寞的午夜裏，他們只有帶着一腔幽怨，帶着一腔抑鬱與苦悶，約了幾個同伴，踅進那俄國菜館或酒排間裏去喝着劣等的麥酒，喝得酩酊大醉了才帶跌帶跑的走出來。有的却獨自個兒坐在陰暗的角落裏，一聲不響地喝着咖啡，追想着沙皇時代的光榮歷史，自己過去的榮華，和眼前的淪落，這故事的回憶，給予他永遠的悲哀。他們痛恨布爾賽維克，但這一切巳成了過去的夢境，如今痛恨，如今追懷，亦是徒然了。</p>
<p>他們也會和侍女調笑，有時喝醉了酒，想起了過去的情形便痛哭一塲。這浪漫悲劇的扮演，正是他們內心的悲哀情緒的表現。</p>
<p>有幾家咖啡店裏，在這靜夜中會有一種悠揚。披霞娜聲輕輕地流出，流出，飄散在街頭，飄散在法國梧桐的葉上；那曼妙的少女的歌聲裏面悠閒地坐着些樂天的歐陸男女，他們在喝着甜蜜的葡萄酒，唱着愛情的歌曲。</p>
<p>霞飛路，它有時會給予人們許多刺激，然而有時候也會給予人們許多安慰！</p>

<h3>吾醫界對於國選抱消極的主張說</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>自從國民大會代表選舉法發表後。全國的民衆。各以自己的立塲。注目到選舉法中關係的各點上。其中有不能了解的，有懷疑不公約。有感覺窒礙的。而總事務所的公事便多。法令解釋委員的腦筋尤費。但是歸根一句。世事總不得其平。不平則嗚。亦事理之常。於是乎喧暄囂囂。議論百出。我們醫界。當然也跳不出這是非口舌之門。所以近臼來。搖旗吶喊的也有。劍拔弩張的也有。拍桌狂吼的也有。唉聲歎氣的也有。但無論是積極。是消極。總還不外乎血性男子。不外乎關心國事的丈夫。比了默默無言。逍遙事外的。終差勝一籌。這要我可把悄極主張人們的幾個理由。錄寫出來。公諸國門。獻諸同道。見仁見智。各自天良罷。</p>
<p>（甲说）自由職業的不入公民。而特別提出的根本原因。為其有一種專門學問。出類拔萃的關係。國家特尊重其職業。高視其人格。大有另眼相看的意思。比方像律師，會計師，工程師，醫師，藥師，新聞記者，敎育團體，大學敎自修自成的。內有幾個。自稱學校學院的。也並沒有得到政府敎育部的認許。也並沒經政府劃入敎育系統。而這類出身的人物。正和工程師相類的泥水木匠。會計師一類的管帳老先生。律師一類的法院代書訟師惡吏。新聞記者一類的賣朝報的。藥師一類的藥工。敎育團體大學敎授一類的鄉下門館先生。說是可併入有資格有學問有科學知識的醫師一格中。使他們競選。眞可說倒盡其霉。寗可自潔。不可看低了自己的人格。和他們沆瀣一氣。去軋道。所以主張放棄選權。不必投票。</p>
<p>（乙說）中醫本沒有合法的團體。因為各地。我們早有醫師公會。已成立多年。照同業公會的組織法。凡同一區域內。不得有第二個同性質的同業公會存在。所以我們認中醫所組織的國醫公會。是不合法的團體。就是同區域內。第二個同性質的同業公會。那麽他們怎樣可以有推選權呢。假使說。地方的主管機關。竟容認了他們的組織。而許他們立案。我們可以說。一定是認他們的組織。不和我們醫師公會同一性質的同業公會。那是最容易明白的事實。而今次的選舉。為什麽把他們挿入我們的醫藥師團體同格中呢。照這樣的亂掉槍花辦法。我們只有放棄選權的一法。</p>
<p>（丙說）無論吾總理曾經說過的。科學才可救國。卽使我們萬一忘記了這個遺訓的。也應當洞察世界大勢。從科學方面提倡進攻。才有出路。而現在國內有一班人士。偏要把玄學的中醫。抬得來八丈高。連這次選舉。竟有人在內做弄手脚。要妄想一手包辦。中醫方面。他不論資格的怎樣。只仗着自己人多一以為舉手便可把我們科學要吃癟。咄，代表不代表。倒沒有什麽希罕。這種行為。卑鄙齷齪。無所不用其極。實在可惡。我們現在極盼望當局的人們。要表示一個眞態度。也不必模稜兩可。顧忌雙方。假使說是要提倡科學醫，而圖國家富强的話。那麽應把時代落伍的玄學醫廢除。不然。也不必開什麽洋式的醫學校。造什麽洋式的療病院。軍隊裏和市面上的洋式醫。更不需要了。而這次的選舉。偏要兩面顧到。在中西醫人數相去懸殊之下。給我們一個傀儡式的混合選舉。呌我們同入渾水缸中。促其腐化。大家如果投票的話呢。總是我們失望多而成功少。倒不如揭開內幕。自動的放棄選權。倒還香脆。</p>
<p>（丁說）聽說一個月前。有所謂中央國醫館的。已在從中活動。並大發訓令。連絡各地的國醫公會。做選舉準備的工作。到近來我們在醫師公會和全國醫師聯合會中。也見到所謂中央國醫館的訓令。我初見之下。倒呆了一呆。以為我自己眼花了。後來仔細的一看。方才發起笑來。原來中央國醫館。不但可把訓令給他們國醫公會。竟又把訓令來給我們醫師公會。和全國醫師聯合會。好托大呀。我們大家。不是都淸楚的嗎。國醫館規則的第一條宗旨。明明自白寫着是一個學術機關。而他的組織法。又用推舉理事的方式。絕不是政府任命的行政官吏。凡學術機關。是不是可用訓令的呢。這公文方式的規矩。我可沒有研究過。或者是最新的規定。也未可知。不過我們孤陋寡聞。倒還第一次見到哩。館長本是精於法學的。並且現任最高法院長。我想决不會錯課。决不會擾亂法規。决不會偕例作俑。且亦决不會訓令到風馬牛不相及的我們警師公會。和全國醫師聯合會的身上。而這種怪現象。恐總是一班坐井的冬烘先生。一旦握着了鷄毛。便當做令箭。在其問一意妄行。此輩為惡有餘。為善不足。我們和他混在一氣。終究不得好結果。不如高蹈的為妙。所以主張在混合選舉不變通時。絕不願投票。</p>
<p>總之。投票不投票。本是個人的自由。我想倒不成問題。不過據以上種種的說數。似乎都因憤慨而至淤悄極。可是消極。絕不是挺好的方法。幷且少了新醫界的幾張選票。在選舉的事實上。也絕不會發生什麽的影響。但是我總以為政府要公民選舉。要自由職業團體選舉。他目的。終想夫家投他一票。切勿放棄了公民的義務。和自己的權利。况且政府對於民衆。當然一視同仁。無所好惡。萬一因憤慨而消極。雖選舉事上。不發生障礙。而選舉史上。終究留了一個污點。所以我希望大家。還是平心靜氣些。再考慮考慮。似乎較為妥當。</p>
<h3>記聖白拉純肺病療養院（上）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>聖白拉純者，S　　Blasien德人自翻　南德黑嶺之竇珠，療養之聖地者也。結核治療與氣候之關係，近世紀中，學者輩出，固已為世人所共知，惟事實上一般高山之氣候，並不完全合於結核之治療，尤以肺結核為然。但聖白拉純之中等高山，對於各種之肺結核，則大都均有　良之　　，此種不甚巨大而平均的刺激力，對於生命之强健能力，以及病體治愈之增進傾向，均極有益。而山問極微之散溫度量，對於病體，尤有節省其生活力之功能，面促進結核之治愈，實為高山氣候所不能幾及者、凡過度刺激之危險，對於新鮮肺結核，或過度虛弱及神經性之病人，於高山氣候所不能忍受者，於此均能避免之。</p>
<p>萊因河之支流，阿而白河之上、有山谷焉，高凡八百公尺，為南德有名之黑嶺，聖白拉純山谷，卽位置於其問，自北而南，山峯駢列，似為天然之屛障。療養院坐北南向，幾盡為松嶺所圍，繞太陽及天空光錢異常豐富，共地氣壓較低，空氣不含織座，風向安定而少霧，盛夏則晚凉，冬日則多陽光，益以交通便利，建設猛晋，其間經過不少學者乏氣候研究及證明，遂成為適合結核之氣候療養地。</p>
<p>歷史　聖白拉純療養院之開始治療肺結核，遠始於一八八二年，創辦人為寳爾好夫博士Dr．Med．Paul　Haufe由　是而後，漸漸擴充，至一八九五年，由阿而白沙博士Dr．Albert　Sander添建新建築，由三十五病床，擴充至一百二十病床，由是療養院之名譽日振，為各國醫家病家所注意焉。</p>
<p>一九一四年，始由白克邁司脫敎授Prof．Bacmister接受院長之職，白氏兼任福朗堡大學敎授，尤致力於有效的治療方法，為光綫治療及外科治療。</p>
<p>療養院位置於松嶺綠茵之間，背峯高一千二百公尺，南向空曠之地，凡一百五十公尺，在一九二三至二五年間，建築新式花園，小丘上下，綴以豆棚花架，間有噴泉，則濺珠飛玉，而雜花如錦，雖在深秋，亦呈絢爛之致，病者療養於斯，殊為賞心悅目者矣。若橫臥憇息，則另闢木棚為之，盛夏隆冬，均可應用。</p>
<p>內部之布置，則以美麗而合於衛生為旨，處處不失家庭之風味，而無病院景象之刺激。凡走廊，樓梯，交誼室，大餐廳，隔離之小飯室，均由專家設計。如交誼室之巨窗間，俱為四季常綠之植物，而予人以一種特殊之快慰。大餐廳之四壁，均以大理石為之，作棕黃色，俾無寒冷之感。壁畫四幀，為風土水火之象徵，由希而特敎授繪成，其意隱寓四者為健康之源泉也。</p>
<p>全院之器具，均合於衛生的條件，易於整潔。凡走廊廁所樓梯公共塲所之地板，均用油類擦凈，其質料為無音之林樂林，Linoleum病人出院以後，卽施以消毒。院內之暖氣設備採取低壓蒸汽法，凡臥室均有冷熱水面具，均製以夭理石。衣橱均位置整內。每室均有電話之裝置，德國全境，均可通語。室南為施行橫臥憇息之洋台，有無綫電之設備。若有事須請醫師或護士，每室有電鈴及電光之裝置，俾於最短時間內尋得。</p>
<p>樓下辦公室外，肴診察室，手術室，耳鼻喉診察室，愛克司光室，化騐室，牙醫室等。男女浴室，採分開制。並有熱水治療室，可施行各種蒸汽及坐浴足浴。洗衣則用蒸汽方法。院內有理髪室，雜貨店，彷彿別成一世界焉。</p>
<p>治療　凡重病而無就痊之望者，槪不收容。若進行性慢性肺病，肋膜炎，氣管校喘息，慢性氣管枝炎，腺病，以及「預防的治療」，如有遺染性之病人，或後天虛弱患者，均可在此間獲到增進抵抗力之結果。總之，聖白拉純之氣候，最合宜於各種肺病之療養。可注意者，為肺結核之新鮮皁期型患者，以最近專家之研究，頗不宜於高山之療養，乃於此問山際氣候，其放溫度量之差異甚輕微者，（卽無劇甚之刺激者）發現為最佳之治療條件。</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九十六）鼻中隔的形態異狀</p>
<p>鼻腔從解剖上，可以分為鼻腔前庭，固有鼻腔，及附屬的副鼻腔。固有鼻腔的前後。各有一孔。前方與外界連通者，為前鼻孔。後方與咽頭連通者，為後鼻孔。而以鼻中隔分為左右兩腔。鼻中隔的位置。殆為垂直。形如板狀物。左右兩面，常相對稱。乃由骨及軟骨性基礎而成。骨部稱為骨性鼻中隔。上方為篩骨垂直板。後方為鋤骨。軟骨性鼻中隔係充塡骨性鼻中隔前方缺損部的四角形鼻中隔軟骨。鼻中隔的形態異狀。大別為二。卽一因被覆粘膜的肥厚（就是因為慢性鼻炎的結果所致）。一因骨或軟骨性基礎的異狀。依鼻中隔基礎的異常。我們可以分為肥厚及彎曲。由肥厚的形狀。更可別為棘與櫛的兩種。棘的形狀，較尖。櫛的形狀，較長。鼻中隔形態異狀的原因。臨床上最多的，有二。卽</p>
<p>（一）外傷—如鼻中隔的骨折或脫兒。在小兒時期，常易跌倒。以致鼻部受著外力作用。而成鼻中隔的畸形。在成年時期，亦多因外傷而起。但多伴鼻外形的異常。</p>
<p>（二）發育異常—一為鼻中隔的發育過良。</p>
<p>一為口蓋骨上，鼻腔的上下徑狹窄。鼻中隔比較的過大。這種事實在腺樣增殖症營口腔呼吸的時候最多。</p>
<p>本症的主要症候。就是在彎曲或肥原的一側。訴有偏側的鼻閉塞。或偏側的反射性神經症狀（譬如偏頭痛及偏側耳鳴等等）但有時於反對側的甲介粘膜。發生代償性肥厚。以致引起兩側鼻閉塞者不少。我們若用鼻銳來檢查。則知鼻中隔彎曲症的發生部位。常在正中錢。它的種類很多。範圍亦不一樣。普通有C字型彎曲，S字型彎曲，有櫛的C字型彎曲，及有銳棘的彎曲等等（參照附圖）。彎曲的一側。不僅突出。他端亦卽相當陷入。在彎曲症的陷入側。常見甲介的代償性肥大。若為棘或櫛。則他側大都平坦。有時可以接觸同側的甲介。此時所來的反射性神經症狀，多屬劇烈。</p>
<p>鼻中隔彎曲，棘，或櫛的治療。祇可求之於外科的手術。方能矯正或切除。手術法中，我們最賞用的。當為克里安氏（Killian）鼻中隔手術。適於施行手術的條件。約有四項。卽（一）有高度鼻閉塞的時候，（二）反射性神經症狀顯著的時候，（三）鼻內處置被障碍的時候，譬如副鼻腔蒂膿症的洗滌及歐氏管通氣法等），及（四）為他種鼻內手術的準備手術。</p>
<h3>鼻中隔彎曲症各型圖示</h3>

<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>唇形科　Labiaae</p>
<p>一，夏枯草　Brunelia　vulgaris，L．</p>
<p>（植物）自生於山野，多年草也。莖方形，通常匍匐於地上，高約03公分，全株密布細毛。葉對生，長柄，作橢圓形或披針形，邊緣有完整者，有作齒牙狀者，其端圓鈍。頂生穗狀花序，初夏開紫色唇形花，稀有作白色者。開花後，花穗變為暗褐色，狀如枯死，故稱夏枯草云。</p>
<p>（生藥）夏枯草（滁州夏枯草）Herba　Brunellae，係採集其花穗而乾燥之者也。巿販品混有莖葉，純為花穗者，方稱良品。</p>
<p>（成分）全草含有可溶性之無基鹽類的3.5％，其中約由68％鹽化加里而成。又含有難溶性之Alkaloid模樣之物質。</p>
<p>（藥理）夏枯草煎汗，濾膜分析，可得總無機鹽，以之注射於家兎之靜脈內，立卽發生血腿下降及呼吸運動之增大，又呈顯著之利尿作用。用其他加里鹽類試騐，亦呈同樣作用。故夏枯草之生理作用，其主要者，應歸功於其含有之加里鹽。本植物中之Alkaloid，無顯著之生理作用。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（四三）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第二二八問）　牙齒拔去後，如不裝鑲，對於隣近和對面的牙齒，有什麼影響？。</p>
<p>答　因為沒有抵抗力，隣牙會漸漸疏開，對面牙齒會漸漸長出。</p>
<p>（第二二九問）　缺少一只牙齒，應該鑲幾只？</p>
<p>答　尋常有二種鑲法，第一種祗需一只磁牙，底下有橡皮或金屬托板，騎架於牙肉上，這種謂之托牙。第二種需三只金牙（前面的牙齒除外），一只實心的在中間，兩只空心的在兩傍，套在左右隣牙上，恰如架橋一樣，這種謂之橋牙。如缺少兩只相連的牙齒，則托牙應鑲兩只，橋牙應襄四只，照此類推。</p>
<p>（第二三〇問）　據說我國舊式拔牙的有一種離骨散，使牙齒無痛自落，有這事嗎？</p>
<p>答　這話我也聽得耳熟，也會一度訪求這藥，但迄無所得。如果這藥眞有價值，能够無須麻藥，不用鉗子，牙齒自落，那末，早應有人把這神妙無比的國藥，發揚光大，在上海這都會，早應隨處可以看見大規模的用離骨散拔牙醫院了！何至於埋沒田野，像隱士般潛藏着，讓那麻老伯鉗大哥去解决一切拔牙的問題呢？可見這藥是靠不住的了。</p>

<h3>取締旅館業額外小賬</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>本市旅業公會，為討論額外小賬問題，前日下午三時，假座市商會常會室，召開臨時會員大會，議决對於實施辦法中，規定不得取保證金，及客人賞給小賬，轉交作航空捐等，萬難接受，若照大體言之，旣有小賬，何以還取額外小賬，此種額外小賬，似應加以取締。</p>
<p>但其事實，則加一小賬，並不給予一般茶房侍役，而為賬房經理等分配者居多，此是滬上旅業，由習慣而幾成法定者也，此種小賬，旣歸賬房經理等分配，則茶房侍役等小賑，不得不另取於顧客，於是乎小賬而有額外矣，質言之，是小賬之外而加一小賬，此共理本不可通。</p>
<p>並且此種小賬，往往有並不出於顧客之自願，而加以勒索者居多，譬如小賬則規定加一，而額外小賬，則非加二加三加四不可，卽如前天有友人至某旅館開一房間，房價一元二角，僅宿一宵，明日給予額外小賬兩毛，茶房不收，說這里房間，從來沒有取過兩角小賬的，結果付他四毛，看其面孔，尚不十分滿意，此種情形，對於旅客方面之非法勒索，深為可惡。</p>
<p>開一房間，旣有小賬，而小賬之外還有小賬，對於顧客方面，非但全不體惜，而更加以苛求，不免要使人裏足不前之懼，此種習慣，旣成風氣，而欲改革，頗屬為難，惟考求所以成為此種風氣之由，半由於茶役之多方需索，半亦由於一部分顧客之養成，滬上原為銷金之窟，而旅業半成為娛樂之塲，視金錢法幣，大有漫不在乎之概，成此豪舉，約有三種：</p>
<p>一，富豪公子，揮金如土，多給賞錢，以示豪闊，二，公餘無事，麻雀八圈，輸贏旣巨，小賬不計，所謂賭里錢最好尋者也，三，社交公開，男女平等，語言投機，目招心許，則旅業又為絕好之待合所，此種行為，小賬亦天然不計，而且格外從豐，有此三種人物，養成茶役等之胃口，所以加一小賬之外，還加一小賬給彼，非但遭其自眼拒絕接受，且目為「鄉野牛謔」，於是不願做牛謔者，亦只得慷旣解囊，以博茶役者之歡顏矣。</p>
<p>顧此種額外小賬，在以上三種人，原自樂輸，但一般正當商人，寒素旅客，則對於此種不應出之小賬，天然大不情願，故現在政府下取締旅業額外小賬之令，極其應該，而對於旅客方面，亦體恤不少，惟欲實行，則窒礙甚多，欲取締旅業之額外小賬，非先將旅業的規程，根本加以糾正不可。</p>
<p>聞旅館中之茶役，非但館方欲收取保證金，而工資亦不給付，故充當茶役者，全以額外小賬為生活，倘經取締，則茶役之生計盡矣，至於保證金一層，更難加以取消，因為充當茶役之人，大抵都是無聊之輩，人格健全者不多，倘見顧客之財帛而起意，雖旅業有銀錢財物，當交賬房之規定，但事實上手續麻煩，支取不易，亦决不能盡行者也，故欲取締額外小賬，和取銷保證金，非先將旅業的組織，加以根本的改造不可。</p>
<h3>湖畔寄語</h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>昨夜我幾乎整夜不能安睡，不曉得是一種怎麼樣的心理，我總覺得心頭好象有點縹緲：似乎是一顆露珠在荷葉上混，也像是一片浮萍在水面上飄，…我無論怎樣也不能使它寗靜。我說不出其所以然，我不願意像你那末說法，把不安定一剎那間的行動，放在「神志不淸」這幾個「惡意」的字眼里面，我知道你的本意自然不是如此。因為事實上並不是誰的「神志昏迷」，對於一個人，一件事，一種意志，以及自己所忠心的事業，…我們沒有媽虎過，我們在工作上支付過很大的熱情，我們一點也不吝嗇，這不是為了什麼，更不能說這是在迷亂之中的人所能意識地做到的事。這只是說明了一個有事業心的人之認眞的態度和熱誠。</p>
<p>我自然不責怪你對於這件事發生疑惑，只要不妨害你對於現實生活的認識，我覺得一個年靑的人抱着懷疑的態度去認識生活，也並不過分。我們常常憧憬着，未來的生活，常常對於一些薪的事物威到驚奇，正如你一開始走上這路就覺得有點不安心和惶悚一樣，其實當你一步一步脚踏實地的堅心做去的時候，你就是覺得這不過是：「原來如此」！為的就是我們還是孩子一樣的不大懂得人情和世故，我們不能扳起臉孔來過日子！我們憑着年靑的熱力來開拓這條艱苦的路，誠如你所說，我們不能在糊里糊塗中過活，但是呆板的生活又全使我們悄失了對事業的熱情。我非常同意你說從互相策勉之中去推動我們的工作的話。我覺得，只有在同一意志的事業中，才能悄減了對於這樣的事底疑惑和猶豫。</p>
<p>我平常就常常警惕過你。在信任一個人和看一件事的態度上，應該要從正反兩面去觀察，你也說過你不時犯了這種粗心的毛病。我眞想不到你徧徧無意中從這不必疑慮的地方來開始。這結果必使你走上了相反的路。在人類的認識力中，這是一個殘酷的悲劇。—而且也從這里就發生了觀念論這種傾向。我希望你不像這里所說的那麼壞能够很快的克制了你自已。正如你對我的批判那麼樣。</p>
<p>我極尊重你，特別是你對事業的熱誠。今天的早晨，一個淸冷而柔和的氣候，我沒有預想到你會給我這麼懇切的贈言，假如不是火車快要開了，我眞不忍在痛苦的微笑之中，離開了你。事情也眞湊巧，我剛上了車廂，火車立刻就開動了，只要遲了一分鐘就是脫班的，這回沒有錯過，眞是幸運。</p>
<p>車行以後，我的心絃就平靜得多了，精神一點不感到疲憊，居然能够在車上看完了兩本書，眞是意外。我重新把「這不過是春天」看了一回。窗外飄進來一些微雨，把我驚覺了，我於是才注意到郊外碧綠的原野，靑蒼的山，藍的天和青山連接着。……車慢慢從田野間爬着，爬過了一巿鎭又一巿鎭，漸漸地走近了松江，在松江停下來的時間並不久，可是一下子卻引起我浮現了一種想像，我想像着那六十來個在松江回來的年靑的伙伴，他們跟我們一樣。失去…………我憤怒，然而我說不出一句話，我默默地看着那矮小的車站，月台，望着無邊的田野：我想起了「都會的一角」里所說到東三省地大物博的山林。…</p>
<p>午牌的時分，火車終於停在杭州了。</p>
<p>我們在湖濱閑蕩了一回。這里的天氣並不像一般人心目中那樣酷熱，也許是天陰的原故吧，湖上倒吹來了滿凉快的淸風，…午後居然下了一塲大雨，眞倒霉，我們今天遊湖的計劃不得不暫時中止了。我昨夜沒有好睡，乘機就睡了一個滿舒暢的午覺。</p>
<p>夜幕慢慢展了開來，我們在湖濱散散步，因為担心晚上還要下雨，不敢作「夜游人」了。布和我在談着年前的往事，眞有點不堪回首之感！…</p>
<p>我希望明天是一個大睛天，讓我晚上好好的安息一會。在湖畔看到遠遠的　火，我想起了「光明」兩字的涵意，也想到壓在心頭的星星之火，我願意把一個蘊藏着的幻想寄與給你。</p>
<h3>三太郎（續）</h3>
<p>— 林納</p>
<p>七八個弟兄，已在門外底小曠塲上列着隊了。他向他們作了一個簡短而又枯燥的說明，便發出命令，把隊伍帶着望河邊出發。在河邊的盡頭，在那陰沉沉的墨黑中，他們會要發現一座小小的，潮濕的屋子，這屋子現在是由兩個武裝兵士把守着。他們必須打開門進去，逐個的把那些罪人們拖出來，在一個廣闊的曠野上列着隊；於是再架起機關槍，拉動它底動針向他們吐射着火花，把他們帶上了另一個飄渺的世界上去。</p>
<p>忽然，他底神經敏銳地痙攣起來了，他底眼前也就不自然地給許多陰影，憤怒的面孔，悲慘的呼聲充塞着。在這陰影里，在這面孔里，在這呼聲里，有他最熟識的，也有他最陌生的：然而，都是同樣那麼有力的戚動着他，使他苦痛着。慢慢地他又想起了，想起了年靑時便守了寡，現在紗廠里當女工的母親，想起了他那皺積的枯瘦的而孔，想起了她低低地說着的話。</p>
<p>「我不能留你，人家不容許我留你，不過你要記淸：我願你回來時，帶給我底禮物是異國弟兄們底呼聲，而不是天皇的光榮…」</p>
<p>他底苦地嘆息着，又低聲的對自己喃道，沒有仇恨，我們原沒有仇恨啊！</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>…他度足步於是不自然地放低，緩慢了，而終於停止。兩眼就漠然的望着遠方，那在微微蠕動着的人影，那潮濕的，沉浸在黑暗中小屋子，接着，他便慢慢的伸出手去，扯下那頂閃灼着帽章底金色光芒的兵帽，用力的望地下一摔，惘然的回轉頭走了。</p>
<h3>在大連的時候</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>第二次我到大連去是在滿洲國成立的第一週年，大連全市的憲兵刑事（卽偵探）無休息的忙碌着，碼頭上，車站上，旅館里，到處佈滿看警戒網。當我從烟台動身之先，已經給一個在牛肉公司做事的同鄉寫了信，把我們的關係弄好，以免將來發生意外。那個同鄉回了快信，一切都按我的意思照辦，於是我放膽的到了大連。輪船上和碼頭上都經過數次的刑事盤問，我對答如流，並且他們臨時還給我的同鄉那家公司打電話，他們承認了我甚他們公司的人，結果沒有出岔子。但他們始終對我有些懷疑。他們一直注意我的神氣和服裝，彷彿他已經斷定了我不像是牛肉公司里的職員。然而又找不出破綻。</p>
<p>受了同鄉益三先生的熱誠招待，我就安然的住在他們公司里。可是苦煞了刑事們，每天他們都來這里光顧，尤其是那個斜斜眼的外號呌「地老鼠」的「此地巴子」，（大連稱本地人為此地巴子）他沒一天不來，坐在櫃台外，喝喝茶，抽抽烟，夥計們都跟他嘻嘻哈哈的，因為在大連地方，商人是不敢輕易得罪這般人—刑事！雖然他百般的想從這里得到我的秘密，到底是煞費苦心，他不能在我身上做筆生意的！</p>
<p>乍時益三先生陪我各處去拜訪同鄉，朋友，後來，他說不要再出去找人，這樣很容易給刑事和憲兵們懷疑。如果每天逛逛窰子，看看戲，到俱樂部去賭錢，那就可以太平無事。這些娛樂除了看戲，我稍威興趣之外，賭和嫖都呌俄頭痛！於是益三先生，領我去逛逛夜市，逛逛花園，有時也到雅片小賣所里去玩玩，看戲因為平日他沒那麼長久的時問，所以在星期日，我們才能到西崗去聽海派劉奎童的戲。果然收效很大，那刑事們再也不來了。</p>
<p>「世界上什麼事都不以嘗試嘗試，見識見識，跟我去走走吧？」</p>
<p>另一個同鄉這樣對我說，我覺得他的話很對，我應當到處去見識一下。這樣我天天都跟着他進俱樂部，雅片館，……果然使我見識了許多沒見過的事，那些可怕的事啊，無數的中國人都葬送在那可怕的魔窟里　我簡直慄慄了！我不敢再去看那些駭人的事體！那用險毒的預謀殺害無辜的奴隸的暴主啊！牠多麼狠毒！多麼殘暴，牠用强權的鐵手把太陽遮掩了，讓光明退到黑暗的後邊，肆無忌憚的宰割着奴隸們！</p>
<p>一天晚上我去逛浪速町夜市在「遼束百貨店」門口遇見了高雲峰，他在「岩倉洋行作廚師，見了我非拉我到他家去坐坐不可。自然我不能推脫，就隨他到他家。出我意料之外！現在他已經有了家眷，一個年輕的太太，還有兩個已經會跑路的男孩子！最使我驚奇的是他那位太太竟是個××姑娘。這樣我腦子里先對雲峰有了壞的印象，「為什麼跟××女人結婚，說不定要給××永世効忠？」</p>
<p>我們談着話，她却在一旁站着聲不響，臉上堆着憂鬱和悲哀，而且服皮有些發　，大槪是跟雲峰吵過架。但是我不能不問雲峰：</p>
<p>「貴夫人為何不說話呢？我希望能同她談談。」</p>
<p>雲峰沒說話先嘆了口氣！望望他夫人，才低下頭，小聲的給我說：</p>
<p>「林子（指他的夫人）的哥哥植木三郎，本來在南滿電氣公司做事，春天因為有煽動罷工嫌疑，被捕入獄，終因證據不足而釋放。後來才又進「大述汽船株式會社」任會計師。古北口大戰的時候，他和三個靑年各處秘密寫皮戰標語，不意又被逮捕，這次大受苦刑，而且左臂也折斷了！他父親聽到兒子的消息，立刻到官廳去聲明，要國家重辦這類叛徒！他不承認他再做他的兒子。結果植木三郎判處死刑！就在前天和他三個同志被槍斃了。林子和他哥哥情感最好，於今他哥哥死了，他怎麼不傷心呢？就是我也很難過，我失掉了一個好朋友！」</p>
<p>眼瞅着雲峰和他的夫人都淌了眼淚，我沉默着半天沒說一句話。</p>
<p>吃過晚飯回到雙和盛牛肉公司，夥計們正在上門板，我進門三老板就問我：「秦先生，你幹嗎去了？益三不放心到外面找你去了」！</p>
<p>益三回來我向他說了好些道歉的話。在床上，我便想起植木三郎君。</p>
<p>「我們少了一個朋友！」</p>
<h3>日光下</h3>
<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>那大熱的天氣又來了。白天，太陽炙着都會的瀝靑的大街，連那些瀝靑也融化了。人在太陽下面不斷地奔走着，為這一天的生活打算，頭腦是昏昏沈沈的，眼睛裏有一點發花，走路是搖搖恍恍的，像要倒下來的樣子。</p>
<p>「要是眞的那麼一倒就倒了下來，什麼事也不要煩惱，什麼苦日子也不要發愁，那倒好了。」老關在大太陽裏走得難受的時候，便又忍不住那麼慘然地想了。那隻要把戲的猴子蹲在他底肩膀上，烘熱得像一座火爐，手裏牽着的那條掛着饗鈴的小花狗，也儘把舌子伸出好長，有着一付可怕的形容。那副雜要的担子重重地壓在他底另一隻肩頭，累贅得像過不完的殘酷的現實生活的祖子一樣。還有，那瘦小得像猴子一樣的他底十四歲的孩子與十二歲的養媳，也掮着要鍊的花槍與大刀，費力地跟在那四十開外的（可是外表上，却老過了他底年齡有十多年的）中年人後面，在暑天的大太陽下面，無休止地奔波着，疲勞而衰乏……</p>
<p>「又是大熱天到了，」一想起這，老關的心裏就覺得有一股酸酸的感覺在衝上來，那生活的無助與慘酷，使人有點不大好受—去年，帶了老婆兒女，亡命似地從故鄉趕出來，不也是大熱天嗎？田裏的流浪的臼子是可怕的：也接連十來天地飢餓過了，也給拉去坐過監獄了，也無吿地行乞過了……一年來，女人死在生活的磨折裏，留下了二個皮包着骨頭的孩子，呌擠在流浪人的一羣裏，被敎了要槍使棒，被敎會了猥褻的小唱與蓮花落，而四十開外的，花白了頭的父親，則被殘酷的生活鍊得更殘酷了，他把自己底孩子弄折了骨，像施着毒刑似地，而他却帶了可怕的獰笑在等候觀衆擲下一個兩個銅子……（未完）</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「花月聯珠」</p>
<p>春江花月夜最繁華。月映花牆花月偕。花愛月明花愛月。月移花影月移花。花開待月琴停響。月裏催花鼓亂撾。滿地落花金萬字。一鈎新月玉丫又。花花世界春常在。月月潮頭信不差。皓月一輪修玉斧。梅花三弄撥銅琶。江郎夢繞生花筆。張子游仙泛月槎。面似桃花眉如月。水中明月鏡中花。好憑月老傳鴛諜。為倩花奴拾鳳釵。拜月焚香情正切。葬花痙玉恨無涯。荻花秋月潯陽客。孤月梅花處士家。月殿播興驚尾帚。花階立月鳳頭鞋。水中撈月空成話。霧裏看花興自佳。桅月懷人悲月榭。　花及第步大街。素娥桂月宮中住。玉女菱花鏡裏揩。欲捲珠簾籠夜月。為刪惡行灌名花。落花啼烏春愁水。斜月殘燈夜夢賒。月裏種花防雨妬。花圓漏月為雲遮。花叢酌酒遊蜂舞。月窟吹篇引鳳諧。月作重衾花作枕。花為四壁月為家。天花亂墜迷花影。秋月常圓看月華。冷月殘風春寂寞。閒花敗枊路橫斜。白雲萬里關山月。碧血千年帝子花。有月無化眞少趣。有花無月靜無譁。從今後。花晨月夕送年華。</p>
<p>何芝芳何琴芳雙珠球</p>
<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午二時一刻至三時</p>
<p>開篇「黛玉焚稿」</p>
<p>風雨連宵鐵馬喧。好花枝冷落大觀園。瀟湘館裏無聲息。有一個，抱病佳人雙淚懸。心切切。淚懸懸。聲寂寂。夜漫漫。聽那，隔牆兒鑼鼓一聲喧。相逢婢子沁芳閘。為甚傷心到這般。那曉，無知婢子直說穿。實二爺今夜完花燭。小夫小婦結團圓。單把你瀟湘妃子瞞。聞一語。腸一斷。一陣陣的傷心一陣的酸。好比那，萬把鋼刀心上攅。脚步蹌踉心恍惚。走熟花園如同陌路般。幸得知心婢紫鵑。相抉同返瀟湘館。把那，舊帕新詩一炬完。閨閣文章未可傳。而今病倒床衾裏。他素來藥石最無緣。心病難將心藥治。凄凄風雨赴黃泉。離了人間未了緣。</p>

Except for those who are incorrigible, those who have no way to return and have realized their mistakes should be pardoned so that they can work together to develop their homeland. He also mentioned cleaning up the bureaucracy, rectifying finances, developing transportation, and education, hoping that all sectors of society will assist the government to achieve success. After the speech, the ceremony concluded. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Kawagoe Leaves Tianjin for Jinan; To Visit Han Fuju After Arriving in Jinan; Undecided Whether to Go to Nanjing at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe left Tianjin at 8:15 PM on the 24th and took the Pingpu train to Jinan to meet Han Fuju. He will stay in Jinan for half a day before transferring to Qingdao. Ono Seishunhiko from Jinan and Secretary Hoshida Ogiwara from the Shanghai Embassy accompanied him. After staying in Qingdao for one day, he will take a ship back to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 24th, Zhang Zizhong hosted a banquet in the Municipal Government Garden to entertain Kawagoe and others. Wang Yitang, Qi Xieyuan, Gao Lingwei, Chuan Rulin, and other famous gentry accompanied them. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe said that he did not prepare a specific topic for the discussion when he visited Han Fuju in Jinan. He gathered the various officials in South China in Shanghai because Foreign Ministry Officer Ota had an idea and took the opportunity to meet them all together. The same was true for the meeting of consuls in Tianjin. As the Japanese Ambassador to China, he can go to Nanjing to meet Foreign Minister Zhang at any time, but he will only go if there is a necessary matter. It is still undecided whether he will go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. The point of agreement between the North China Consular Conference and the military attaché conference is that they are all willing to do their best to help promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and provide Japanese technical assistance to achieve it. When he met Song Zheyuan a few days ago, Song expressed his hope that the Japanese side would invest and provide technical assistance in the economic development of North China to achieve Sino-Japanese cooperation. In short, the various consultations in Tianjin this time did not make any major decisions against your country, nor did they contain any serious elements. The current situation in North China is quite good, no different from a few months ago. He personally has no threats. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, left here for Jinan at midnight today and will meet with Lu Chairman Han Fuju tomorrow. The conference of Japanese consuls in various parts of North China continued this morning. The consuls and Colonel Kagesa, who was sent by the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, exchanged opinions. It is reported that all parties participating in the conference agreed that Japan should provide technical assistance to the economic development of North China. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ambassador Kawagoe left Tianjin at 8:50 PM on the 24th for Jinan and is scheduled to return to Shanghai by ship from Qingdao on the 27th. (Allied dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>On Amnesty for Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>On the 23rd, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Lushan and gave a speech to the Central News Agency reporters. One section of it mentioned the issue of amnesty for political prisoners. He stated, "Mr. Feng Huanzhang once made this suggestion. Chairman Chiang also mentioned it during the oath-taking ceremony of the Guangdong party, government, and military personnel. The Central Government still holds the principle of leniency, and grants amnesty to political prisoners who have contributed to the revolution, giving them a path to self-renewal, which can reduce the collective power of reactionaries." We, the people, feel infinitely happy upon hearing this news and hope that the government can formulate concrete measures and implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>From a purely political standpoint, the existence of political prisoners in a country is not a good phenomenon. Because the formation of political prisoners indicates that the politics of this country has not yet been on track and has not been supported by the entire people. Therefore, in countries with relatively clear politics, such as Britain and the United States, one rarely hears about political prisoners. The reason why a government detains political prisoners is to prevent them from overthrowing the current administrative system. This is mostly done under emergency situations. But after the emergency situation has passed and the government's position has regained a solid foundation, they often grant amnesty to political prisoners. Many facts can be found in the history of various countries. Therefore, the implementation of amnesty for political prisoners can indeed indicate that the central government of a country has become consolidated and is no longer afraid of political enemies attempting to overthrow it.</p>
<p>The above is a general aspect of the issue of amnesty for political prisoners. Under the current Chinese environment, amnesty for political prisoners has even greater significance. Since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has become more serious day by day. Under the aggressors' aggressive advances, if our entire nation does not unite all its forces to seek resistance, it will inevitably be destroyed one day. The past facts have given us extremely valuable lessons. Now the central government intends to grant amnesty to political prisoners, which is of great significance to the future of China's national liberation. Because these political prisoners are not comparable to ordinary criminals. Their intelligence and talent are relatively superior. Now, if the central government grants them amnesty, they can actively participate in the national salvation movement, then China's national liberation will surely have a brighter future.</p>
<p>Some people think that political prisoners may still oppose the government after being pardoned. This seems to be an overestimation. Because the main motivation for pardoning political prisoners under the current situation in China is to concentrate the power of national salvation. Under this great goal, the forces of all parties and factions have already merged into one. All internal disputes must be eliminated. If one person deviates from this great goal, then they have become a traitor and are no longer a political prisoner. We, the people, feel very happy to hear that the Central Government is going to grant amnesty to political prisoners, because this is an important step in concentrating the national strength to resist the aggressors. We hope that the government can formulate concrete measures and implement them as soon as possible. We not only hope that the government will pardon political prisoners who have no party affiliation, but also hope that the government will pardon political prisoners who have party affiliation. We not only hope that the government can pardon "current political prisoners," but also hope that the government will pardon "future political prisoners." Only in this way can the national strength for national salvation be concentrated, and the future of national liberation will have the confidence of victory.</p>
<h3>Japan's Unified Diplomatic Policy Towards China Achieves Some Success; It is Expected that Kawagoe Will be the Central Figure in Sino-Japanese Negotiations to Resolve the Economic Problems of Hebei Province and Other Pending Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that after the explanation of Japan's policy towards China by Ambassador Kawagoe and special envoys of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry, the Tianjin meeting of senior staff officers in Changchun and military officers in various regions has established a resolution similar to that of Tokyo. Kawagoe will take appropriate diplomatic procedures to further resolve the economic problems of Hebei Province and other pending issues. In principle, the economic development of Hebei Province will be based on Sino-Japanese joint management, and the permission of the Nanjing authorities will be obtained. Japan's unification of its diplomatic policy towards China seems to have achieved some success so far. It is expected that Ambassador Kawagoe will be the central figure when Sino-Japanese negotiations begin, while other Japanese representatives will engage in lateral work. Although the specific contents of Japan's proposals are not yet known, the scope of its proposals can be imagined. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Two Memorial Weeks at the Center</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 38th memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 24th. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Chaojun, He Yingqin, Gu Zhenglun, Zhou Qigang, Chu Minyi, Gan Naiguang, Li Wenfan, Zhou Bomin, Li Zonghuang, Chen Shuren, Zhang Zhen, Wang Shufang, Mei Gongren, Wen Yiyou, Ouyang Ge, and all staff members, totaling about 700 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Ma Chaojun gave a report, stating that he was ordered to inspect the Qingdao municipal administration and felt that the municipal administrations of Qingdao and Nanjing had sufficient materials for comparison. He first mentioned that the Nanjing municipal administration had made great progress since the founding of the capital, transforming from an old city into a modern metropolis, which was not easy. In the past year alone, there has been progress in road construction, education, finance, and land consolidation, according to statistics. As for the sewer project and waterworks improvement, they have also begun to be implemented. The promotion of civic education has also been effective. However, due to the Nanjing municipal government's insufficient finances and small authority, difficulties often arise in handling affairs, especially the lack of police command, which prevents it from fully exerting its administrative effectiveness. Taking land as an example, it has not been able to collect land for public ownership according to Sun Yat-sen's proposal, resulting in numerous disputes when the municipal government collects land, which often leads to appeals to higher authorities, delaying years and making it impossible to carry out any construction. Looking at Qingdao, the authority is concentrated, the organization is sound, and the finances are sufficient. All the land in the city is owned by the municipal government, so everything is better than in Nanjing. In recent years, under the efforts of Mayor Shen, the results have become more apparent, especially the promotion of rural education and compulsory education, which is of great value for us to learn from. Ma finished his speech and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its memorial week at 9:00 AM on the 24th. Tan Zhen, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials of the National Government and various departments, totaling more than 400 people, attended. Vice President Tan Zhen presided over the meeting, led the ceremony, and gave a report. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen reported at the National Government's memorial week on the 24th, "Studying Sun Yat-sen's principles should pay attention to their integrity," generally meaning that regarding Sun Yat-sen's legacy, the chairman has explained and elaborated in detail on the memorial week over the years. He personally felt that we, who adhere to Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, should know that they are integral and inseparable, and we must study them deeply to understand them, so that we can promote them and implement them effectively. Only by simultaneously realizing the entire Three Principles of the People can we fulfill our responsibilities. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Party, government, and military agencies held a joint memorial week at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 9:00 AM on the 24th. Chairman Chiang, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Zeng Yangfu, Xiang Hanping, and other representatives from various agencies, totaling more than 1,000 people, attended. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, stating that social transformation must come first in order to make Guangdong a model province. He hoped that leaders of all party and government agencies would lead by example, lead their subordinates, and reform the old life and old atmosphere. He also listed the drawbacks of various agencies: (1) Slowness; (2) Unreality, irresponsibility, which must be thoroughly corrected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Thoughts on Living in Lushan; Had Cabled Li and Bai to Advise them to go to Guangzhou; Eliminate Social Hypocrisy and Extravagance</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) According to a phone call from Guling, a Central News Agency reporter visited Vice Chairman Feng on the morning of the 24th and was received. The reporter asked about the Guangxi situation. Feng stated that Chairman Chiang was determined to advocate peace. After the committee arrived in Guangzhou, he immediately telegraphed Li and Bai, advising them to go to Guangzhou for face-to-face talks. If everyone can meet, everything can be discussed at length. Otherwise, disgruntled elements and politicians will sow discord, which will easily create estrangement and never resolve it. Li and Bai replied on the 23rd, expressing their willingness to consider it. He immediately replied and urged them again, and has submitted the two telegrams to Chairman Chiang. The reporter asked about Feng's thoughts on living in the mountains, as Feng was an early riser and there were thread-bound books next to his desk. Feng stated that after coming to the mountains, several Western friends had invited him to dine, and there was only one soup and two dishes, with meat accounting for only one of them. The host was very courteous and said that if he wanted more, he could take it himself. How cordial! In contrast, Chinese banquets often involve delicacies from land and sea, eight large and ten small dishes, which take three or four hours. Most of the fruits and foods are left over. The cost of one table is often enough to provide food for farmers for half a year. How can the country not be weak, and how can the people not be poor? Society is full of hypocrisy and extravagance, which is lamentable. In addition, when Chinese people come to the mountains to escape the heat, they live in Western-style houses and compete with Westerners for material enjoyment, but they are unwilling to imitate simple diets and walking upright instead of riding in cars. The difference in physical strength is obvious, and the judgment of strength and weakness is clear. Regarding national affairs, Feng advocates burying oneself in hard work and requires national unity to support the central government to consolidate the country's position as the top priority. Feng denied the reports that he would return to Mount Tai for a short stay and said that he would stay in Lushan for a considerable period of time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) According to a phone call from Guling, Vice Chairman Feng recently engraved two paragraphs from Mozi's "Shangtong" near Yuyuan Pond east of Qixian Temple in Lushan, and attached an epilogue. The text is recorded as follows: "When the superiors govern, they will be able to govern if they obtain the feelings of the subordinates, and they will be chaotic if they do not obtain the feelings of the subordinates. How do you know this? When the superiors govern, they will be clear about the good and evil of the people. If they are clear about the good and evil of the people, they will reward the good and punish the violent. If the good are rewarded and the violent are punished, then the country will be governed." "In ancient times, when the sky began, the people had no rulers. The people were human, and if the people were human, one person had one justice, ten people had ten justice, one hundred people had one hundred justice, one thousand people had one thousand justice. By the time the number of people could not be counted, then the so-called justice could not be counted either. All of these are his justice, and not the justice of others. Therefore, the thick ones are fighting, and the thin ones are contending. Therefore, the desire of the world is the same justice of the world. These are the words of Mozi. The wise men of the past discussed the Tao and governed the country, hoping that the world and future generations would know what to follow, and that the country would be based on the security of a rock. I travel to Mount Kuang, as if entering a paradise. Therefore, I hope that the security of the country is as safe as Mount Lushan. I have specially excerpted Mozi's words and engraved them here to inform the world, and also to commemorate my footprints." Feng Yuxian, summer of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China. The above excerpts and epilogue have been written, each character is about one foot six or seven inches, in regular script, and engraving has begun, which is expected to be completed in about four weeks. In addition, Feng recently planned to carve stone paintings and inscriptions on the four surrounding walls of the Revolutionary Martyrs Shrine in Taishan Luanzhou, with 48 paintings based on the actual living conditions of the civilians in the Taishan area, painted by Zhao Wangyun, and Feng wrote poems and calligraphy. Zhao's paintings have all been completed, and only the titles and calligraphy of "Monk Chanting Sutras" have been completed. Each painting and inscription is about two feet long and one foot wide. Feng's calligraphy is in the official script and has great strength. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Provisional Measures for Import Duty on Foreign Rice in Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past, import duty on foreign rice in Guangdong was not levied according to regulations. Before Chen Jitang left Guangdong, he even ordered a one-month tax exemption. After the situation in Guangdong stabilized, the Guangdong Customs, in order to maintain the integrity of customs administration, levied import duty on foreign rice according to regulations, which caused misunderstandings among the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, who requested assistance from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry considered that the measures taken by the Guangdong Customs were originally legitimate, but in consideration of the fact that the situation in Guangdong had just stabilized and the sudden imposition of rice tax by the Customs would affect the people's food supply, it specially approved provisional measures for implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) Foreign rice that has arrived within the period from July 20 to August 10 will be released duty-free. (2) For rice imported from Guangdong thereafter, the import duty to be levied will be reduced by half of the tariff rate stipulated in the tax regulations, and an additional tax of 10% will be levied.

<h3>Kwantung Army Announces Russian Conspiracy Incident: Plot to Organize Anti-Japanese Puppet Shock Brigade: Nine Executed by Firing Squad, Twenty-Eight Sentenced to Penal Servitude</h3>

As a result, Xieerkolakofu, Heidelni, Kolawiechi and other nine people were executed by firing squad outside Hailar on the 21st. The remaining 28 were sentenced to fixed-term and indefinite imprisonment. (Hualianshe dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the Kwantung Army's announcement, the outline of the Russian conspiracy incident in the Sanhe area is as follows:</p>
<p>Around 1924 and 1925, the border line was almost completely open. Secret agents disguised as White Russians dispatched by Soviet Russia secretly contacted Soviet Russia to carry out activities to communize the Sanhe area. However, since the founding of "Manchukuo," they still remained in Sanhe, skillfully planning. Thereafter, the fact of advocating communism was discovered in 1934 and was severely punished at that time, but under the instigation and planning of Soviet Russia, a secret organization was formed before April and May 1934. Twenty people, including Xieerkolakofu, a Kazakh military instructor, gathered at Xieerkolakofu's residence and, after Xie explained the purpose and mission of the Soviet shock brigade, Xie read out the list of party members, absolutely prohibiting the organization from spreading its message to the outside world. Thereafter, they more closely linked up with the Soviet side. Xieerkolakofu served as chairman and gathered at Stadguf's residence, gradually expanding, strengthening, and fulfilling the organization's mission. At that time, the comrades who were gathered were said to number about 300, called the Soviet shock brigade. They were usually puppets of Soviet Russia, responsible for obtaining intelligence and pacifying White Russians. Once a war broke out, they immediately took up arms and rose up to attack the local Japanese and Manchukuo military offices in order to echo the Red Army's capture. Those who have been executed are nine people, including Xieerkolakofu, and the other 28 have been sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years or less.

<h3>Japan Hastily Building Large Radio Station to Counter the Soviet Union: Power of 150 Kilowatts</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet government recently changed the wavelength and degree of the radio waves in Khabarovsk. The Japanese Ministry of Communications believes that the power of the Khabarovsk radio station is 100 kilowatts, which is more powerful than the Tokyo radio station. Under the same wavelength, the Tokyo radio station's broadcast is hindered by it. It has repeatedly protested to the Soviet government, but so far it has not been effective. According to the International Radio Treaty, the power wavelength used by a radio station should be reported to the Berlin Electrical Communications Association before use to register its degree, and it is forbidden to use the same radio waves that have already been registered by other countries. The Ministry of Communications authorities, because the Soviet Union has violated international treaties and has no attitude of repentance, are hastily building radio stations in Nagasaki, Yuzawa Prefecture, and Kawaguchi, installing broadcasting equipment with a power of 150 kilowatts in order to overwhelm the Khabarovsk radio station.

<h3>German National Socialist Party to Hold Congress: "Anti-Communism" as Slogan: Hungarian Regent Meets with Hitler: Suggests Germany, Austria, and Hungary Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler is now resting in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. According to sources with inside information, the Führer is engaged in preparations there because the annual congress of the National Socialist Party is imminent (held every September in Nuremberg). It is said that this year's congress will take "struggle against communism" as its main slogan. Political figures also claim that communism now has a trend of waning westward, and the Spanish civil war is clear evidence of this. Germany regards itself as a barrier to Western Europe and cannot sit idly by. Recently, the Soviet authorities reduced the age for enlisting new soldiers from 21 to 19, which doubled the number of soldiers in the country's army. At that time, various newspapers here published fierce remarks attacking the Soviet Union. This is the prelude to Germany's all-out attack on communism. The Spanish government's recent mortal combat with the Fascists is also a target of German attack. In general, if Spain does not return the German aircraft that were seized (there were originally six, five have now been returned, and one Junkers bomber remains) and does not provide a satisfactory response to the "Cameroon" incident, Germany will sever diplomatic relations with it. In addition, Germany's military service period will also be increased from one year to two years in order to respond to the actions taken by the Soviet Union. The defenses along the Rhine River will be greatly strengthened. The above decisions may be taken before the opening of the National Socialist Party Congress. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy met with German Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Germany, yesterday. It is now known that Horthy's trip was not a temporary decision and had been planned for some time. As for what Horthy and Hitler discussed, it was the following two issues: one was the agreement recently signed between Germany and Austria and its repercussions on the European political situation, and the other was the danger of communism. It is also heard that Horthy suggested that the authorities of Germany, Austria, and Hungary should hold a meeting soon, which Hitler approved. Responsible persons in Austria believe that this meeting is difficult to hold without the participation of Italy. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy, who recently met with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and German Führer Hitler, will soon come to Italy to visit Prime Minister Mussolini. Responsible persons recently stated that it is not yet known whether the Prime Minister intends to meet with Horthy, but the relations between Italy and Hungary have always been close, and it would be common and unsurprising for the authorities of the two countries to gather together.

<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Military Preparations: Japan Deeply Wary</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Moscow government announced the death sentence for Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other leaders of the old Communist Party on the 22nd in connection with the assassins of Kirov. According to a compilation of information received from official sources, it is said that the Moscow government's sudden rush to judge and publish the death sentence was because it was stimulated by the Spanish revolutionary party. In view of the fact that the dictatorial National Front is recovering its power, at this time it is exaggerating the strategy of dictatorship for the purpose of carrying out national propaganda to expand military preparations on the European border. The Moscow government strongly stated that the terrorist incident in which Zinoviev, Kamenev, and others assassinated Kirov was an anti-Soviet movement linked to the dictatorship of Italy. In order to incite the people to hate the dictatorship, it advanced the public trial and suddenly announced the death sentence, seemingly to make the people thoroughly understand that it is therefore necessary to strengthen military preparations. However, recently, the Soviet Union has been strengthening its defenses on the European border, changing the age for conscription, and concluding a mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Romania. The construction of a railway link between the Soviet Union, Romania, and Czechoslovakia is also frequently in progress. Therefore, taking advantage of this public trial, it may further expand its military preparations on the western border of Europe, and some believe that this will reduce the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East, which may have a positive impact on Japan and "Manchukuo." However, the Soviet Union's Far East mobilization plan is separate from the European Russian plan and has its own independence. The European Russian troop increase plan has an actual impact. Therefore, the Imperial Government still does not abandon its vigilant attitude and is watching its progress. (Dōmei News Agency dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Reactionary Criminals Tried; Sixteen Defendants Sentenced to Death; Only a Slim Hope of Appealing to the Central Executive Committee for Survival; Otherwise, Execution Within Seventy-Two Hours</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The historically famous communist revolutionary leader Zinoviev, along with Kamenev, and fourteen other counter-revolutionary party members, were previously accused of being involved in the 1934 assassination of Stalin's deputy Kirov, colluding with a faction of the German secret police, engaging in espionage and terrorism, and plotting to assassinate Stalin, among other activities.  The open trial in court of this shocking major case has now concluded. Today, it was announced that Zinoviev, Kamenev, and the other fourteen defendants were all sentenced to death.  It is said that all the defendants confessed their guilt. However, the court deliberated in detail for eight hours before announcing the sentence of execution by shooting. After the judge read the verdict, onlookers in the courtroom cheered loudly. At present, the only hope for the defendants to survive is to appeal to the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee, which could prevent execution within seventy-two hours of the verdict. However, during the court trial, the defendants all confessed to the charges against them. Therefore, even with the opportunity to appeal, it is feared that it may not be effective. From the perspective of the Soviet Russian government, it may be possible to pardon some of the defendants' sentences. It is said that when the court was about to announce the verdict, Kamenev spoke, warning the Soviet Russian state to remain highly vigilant in the future and not to relax its guard, because as long as Trotsky is not apprehended, Trotsky's followers will continue to invade Russian territory and implement terrorist tactics, etc.  Kamenev further entrusted his three sons with his final declaration, to be conveyed to the youth of the nation, stating that Stalin is the greatest leader of the world's workers, and the youth of the country should cherish him. He also implored the youth of Soviet Russia not to follow anti-communist discipline, lest they repeat his own mistakes, etc. It is said that one of Kamenev's three sons is an aircraft pilot in the Red Army. It is claimed that during the trial of this case, many shocking things were discovered, the most prominent of which was the defendants' eagerness to confess their guilt. When the court conducted separate interrogations, Kamenev confessed that their conspiracy to commit terrorist acts was due to personal resentment towards Stalin and the desire to seize power. As for his personal animosity towards Stalin, it was actually due to Stalin's implementation of a certain socialist policy that proved successful. Kamenev also confessed to a far-reaching conspiracy, implicating the formal spokesperson for Soviet Russian foreign policy, Radek, and Bukharin, the editor-in-chief of Izvestia, the official propaganda organ of the Central Executive Committee.

<h3>Trotsky's Indignant Remarks</h3>
<p>Oslo, Norway. The Soviet anti-establishment leader Trotsky recently commented on the counter-revolutionary case fabricated by the current Soviet authorities, for which the Soviet authorities have sentenced people to death. It recalls that the Soviet trade union leader Tomsky committed suicide yesterday. This person was originally one of the members of the Communist Party's Politburo. When the bureau was first established, it was composed of seven members: Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, Stalin, Tomsky, and the remaining (Trotsky referring to himself). Now, except for Lenin, who died long ago, and Stalin, who holds great power, the other five have been accused of using terrorist means and conspiring to harm the state. Tomsky has led the labor movement for the past thirty years and made outstanding contributions. He is one of the important leaders of the Soviet Union. Now, he has ended his life with a tragic end, which is regrettable. In short, Tomsky's suicide and the counter-revolutionary case fabricated in Moscow have very clear significance. What is the significance? That is, the traditional spirit and political program of the entire Communist Party have died halfway." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway. The exiled Communist Party leader Trotsky, today, in a mocking tone, denigrated the incident of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and fourteen other counter-revolutionary party members being sentenced to death in Moscow, saying, "Their death sentence this time is obviously due to being fooled by the Soviet GPU (a type of secret detective), because it promised Zinoviev and others that as long as they confessed their guilt, they could be spared from death," etc. Trotsky also claimed that the various "secret spies," such as Balman, Wolfberg, and David, etc., may not be executed, but may instead be released after changing their names, and it is not impossible that they may even be promoted. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Main Text of the Supreme Court Verdict</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The main text of the verdict of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union regarding Zinoviev, Kamenev, and the other fourteen defendants is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the autumn of 1932, based on the order that Smirnov, the leader of the Trotskyist faction conducting secret work in the Soviet Union, received from Radek, the Trotskyist faction conducting secret work and the Zinovievist faction formed a 'Joint Center,' including Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov, and Bakayev (representing the Zinoviev faction) and Smirnov, Termer-Teryan, and Fritz David (representing the Trotsky faction). The combination of this counter-revolutionary group was completed on the basis of implementing individual terrorist means against the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. Under the direct orders of Trotsky received by the Trotskyists in the 'Joint Center' through the defendants Smirnov, Goltzman, and Ter-Vaganyan, during this period (1932-1936), they concentrated their hostile activities against the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party, focusing on organizing terrorist acts against the leaders of the government and the party. The court has proven that this 'Joint Center,' under the direct command of Trotsky and Zinoviev, and through the Zinovievist terrorist members in Leningrad, Nikolaev, Kotorin, etc., organized and carried out the despicable assassination of Kirov, a member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, on December 1, 1934.</p>
<p>"The Trotsky Center was not satisfied with the assassination of Kirov. It also prepared to carry out terrorist acts against Stalin, Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Kaganovich, Ordzhonikidze, Kosior, and Postyshev. According to the materials obtained by the court's investigation and the confessions of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov, Bakayev, Mirashkovsky, and Ter-Vaganyan, it has been proven that Trotsky abroad and Zinoviev in the country made efforts to accelerate the preparations for the assassination of Kirov. In order to accelerate the assassination of Kirov, Kamenev, carrying the order of the Trotskyist Joint Center, went to Leningrad in June 1934 to discuss with Yakovlev, one of the leaders of the Leningrad terrorist group, how to organize terrorist acts against Kirov. Yakovlev's case will be tried separately. The court also confirmed that Bakayev, carrying the order of the 'Joint Center,' also went to Leningrad in November 1934 to inquire of the terrorist member in that city, Nikolaev Kotorinov, how far the preparations for the assassination of Kirov had progressed. When the members of the group held secret meetings, Bakayev listened to the report of Leony Nikolaev, the assassin of Kirov, and, on behalf of the Trotskyist Joint Center, gave him and his accomplices practical instructions on how to organize the assassination of Kirov. According to these instructions, Nikolaev and his party carried out the assassination of Kirov on December 1, 1934.</p>
<p>"The court also proved that Bakayev, Reingold, and Ter-Vaganyan, in 1934, following the resolution of the 'Joint Center,' once plotted to assassinate Stalin. In order to ensure that this terrorist act planned by the 'Joint Center' would not fail, the center organized the so-called 'Moscow Terrorist Center' in Moscow in 1933, including Reingold, Pikel, and Ter-Vaganyan, and was under the direct guidance of Bakayev, a member of the 'Joint Center.' The 'Joint Center' assigned Bakayev to be responsible for the actual preparation and implementation of the assassination of Stalin and Kirov, while Ter-Vaganyan, a member of the 'Moscow Terrorist Center,' was assigned to organize terrorist acts against Voroshilov.</p>
<p>"Trotsky was not satisfied with directly commanding the 'Joint Center' to carry out terrorist acts against the leaders of the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party. During the period from 1932 to 1936, in order to achieve the same goal, he also systematically sent many terrorist members from abroad to the Soviet Union. In mid-November 1932, Trotsky sent Berman Yurin and Fritz David to the Soviet Union. When they set off, Trotsky personally instructed them on the methods of organizing the assassination of Stalin. In the same year, Trotsky also sent the terrorist Natan Lurie from Berlin to Moscow. After Lurie arrived, he colluded with Himmler (the current head of the Gestapo)'s confidant Franz Weitz, a secret agent of the Gestapo (German secret political police), to jointly prepare the assassination of Stalin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Ordzhonikidze. At that time, Weitz posed as a foreign expert living in Moscow. After Weitz left Moscow in the winter of 1932, Natan Lurie and his terrorist members continued this terrorist activity, but in cooperation with Moses Lurie, who came to Moscow from Berlin in March 1933, also under Trotsky's order to accelerate the assassination work of Soviet government and Communist Party leaders. In 1934, at the construction site of the Chelyabinsk factory, Natan Lurie attempted to assassinate Kaganovich and Ordzhonikidze. Finally, on May 1, 1936, Natan Lurie, carrying Moses Lurie's order and with his prior consent, attempted to assassinate Zhdanov during the May Day parade in Leningrad.</p>
<p>"In the summer of 1935, Trotsky, through his son Sedov, sent the terrorist Orlov from Berlin to the Soviet Union. This person used a forged passport of the Republic of Honduras, which was obtained with the help of the Gestapo. Orlov obtained Trotsky's prior consent through Sedov. This incident should seek the assistance of the German secret police. After arriving in the Soviet Union, Orlov immediately established a connection with the counter-revolutionary terrorist members of the Trotskyist faction in Gorky City and prepared many terrorist members, ordering them to carry out the assassination of the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party leaders in Red Square in Moscow on May 1, 1936.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>"The court will further prove that, in addition to preparing terrorist acts against Stalin, Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Kaganovich, Ordzhonikidze, the Trotskyist terrorist center also carried out terrorist acts against Kosior and Postyshev through terrorist members in Ukraine. These Ukrainian terrorist members were under the guidance of the Trotskyist Mokshin, and their case will be tried separately.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the crimes of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov, Bakayev, Mirashkovsky, Ter-Vaganyan, and Smirnov have been proven, because they (A) organized the Trotskyist Joint Center, plotted to assassinate the leaders of the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party, (B) prepared and carried out the assassination of Kirov on December 1, 1934, through the secret terrorist members in Leningrad, Nikolaev, Kotorinov, etc., (C) organized many terrorist groups, preparing to assassinate Stalin, Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Kaganovich, Ordzhonikidze, Kosior, and Postyshev, violating Article 58, Clause 8, and Clause 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.</p>

<h3>The Second International Defends the Defendants; Moscow Newspaper Publishes an Article Denouncing It</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Second International, Tebruggen, the Secretary-General, Attlee, the Chairman of the International Federation of Trade Unions, Shetolan, and the Secretary-General, Scheffner, are holding a meeting in Paris. They recently jointly sent a telegram to the People's Committee of the Soviet Union, stating, in brief, that at a time when the Spanish working class is united and fighting against fascism, it is regrettable that a counter-revolutionary case has occurred within the Soviet Union. They hope that all defendants can enjoy all the rights of defense as usual, and that lawyers who are impartial and not controlled by the Soviet government will be appointed to defend them, so that "the defendants may be spared the death penalty." The Communist Party organ newspaper Pravda recently published a commentary on this matter, saying, "After investigation, the People's Committee discovered that the purpose of this telegram is to interfere with the rights and obligations of the Soviet court. Therefore, it believes that there is no need to reply. The criminals currently being tried by the Soviet court are none other than the irreconcilable enemies of the Soviet state and social system, and they are also a group of villains who incite discord and instigate assassination. This is known to the world. Now, someone is begging for leniency for them. Isn't this opposing the Soviet Union? We must severely denounce it before the working class of the world," etc. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Twenty-One Rebel Planes Bomb Barracks in the Suburbs of the Capital, Dropping No Fewer Than Four Hundred Bombs; Malaga Under Siege on Three Sides</h3>
<p>Port of Rabat, French Morocco: The revolutionary army in Seville, Spain, recently issued a broadcast message, confirming that the army did indeed send twenty-one planes to bomb the "Four Sides" airfield near Madrid, dropping no fewer than four hundred bombs. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The Seville "Daily News" reported today that rebel planes departed from Tablada and bombed Madrid. This is the first time since the rebellion occurred. It is said that the bombing target was military camps and other places where troops were concentrated. Because the government army also bombed the towns occupied by the rebels, retaliation was carried out. After bombing Madrid, the rebel planes flew to Toritto in the air, distributing leaflets, encouraging the rebels there to do their best to resist, and especially urging Colonel Yeggo's troops stationed abroad to come to their aid. At the same time, the "Vos Gullo" newspaper claimed that Malaga is now under attack by the rebels on three sides and has entered a state of terror. In the Cordoba rebel camp, government planes dropped fifty-eight bombs. According to Madrid radio reports, a government plane shot down three enemy planes on the Aragon front.

<h3>Battle News from Various Fronts; Conflicting Reports from Both Sides</h3>
<p>Madrid: According to news issued by the Northern Route Headquarters of the revolutionary army in Valladolid, it sent twenty-one planes to bomb the "Four Sides" airfield near the capital and the city of Getafe. However, this statement was recently denied by the government, which stated that the government army on the northwest route had already entered the city of Oviedo. As for the front line of the city of Zaragoza on the northern route, the government army had already defeated a column of rebels, seized four cannons, a batch of machine guns and rifles, and captured many people. As for the front money on the southern route, the government army will also begin a general offensive. In addition, the government army's expedition to the island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea (belonging to the Balearic Islands), after encircling and severely attacking the rebels, has already seized a large number of ammunition. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The government recently declared that three columns of the government army attacking the southern city of Cordoba are progressing extremely smoothly. Loma Village is very close to the city and is in a strategically important position. It has recently been occupied by the first column. The second column arrived soon after. Recovering the city of Cordoba from there is as easy as taking something out of a pocket. After the second column engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the rebels and inflicted heavy damage, it is now bombarding the city of Cordoba with cannons. It is heard that many of the rebels' "regular troops" have already surrendered to the government army and turned against the rebels. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Seville: The radio station belonging to the revolutionary army here recently issued a broadcast message at 1:15 p.m. today, stating that major battles took place on all fronts yesterday. In the Andalusia region of the southern route (including the provinces of Cordoba, Granada, and Malaga), two columns of the Red Army (i.e., the government army) were defeated by our army's land and air forces. On the western route, the troops of our army's commander General Srancho also defeated a strong column of the Red Army, seizing sixteen machine guns, thirty cannons, one tank, one ambulance, and countless weapons. According to reports, this column was well-organized and strong, and it was one of the best in the government army, but it was also defeated by our army. Therefore, the result of this battle is extremely noteworthy. As for the Madrid government, it is now only engaged in eliminating dissidents and transporting cash out of the country. The day of its downfall will not be far off. Moreover, the large-scale outflow of domestic cash will cause endless harm to the national economy. The current government does not hesitate to commit this crime, and the responsibility it bears will never be relieved. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Blocked Off the Coast of Spain; British Naval Authorities Lodge Representations; Spanish Government Captain Apologizes</h3>
<p>(London) The case of the British ship "Chippel Tilhuan" has been satisfactorily resolved. According to the British Navy Department, the captain of the flagship "Coterlington" of the minor team protested to the Spanish cruiser that had blocked the British ship after interfering with the British ship off the coast of Spain.

<h3>New Anglo-Egyptian Treaty to be Formally Signed Tomorrow; Egyptian Delegation Arrives in London, Receives Enthusiastic Welcome from Crowds</h3>
<p>(London) The fully empowered Egyptian delegation, comprised of thirteen prominent figures, arrived in London last night. Their purpose is to formally sign the recently concluded Anglo-Egyptian treaty. All discord between Britain and the Egyptian Nationalist Party has been dispelled by the treaty’s conclusion. The Egyptian delegation is led by the current Prime Minister, General Nahas. The delegation includes twelve generals, three of whom previously served as Prime Ministers: namely, Muhammad Sidqi and Abdu'l-Fattah Yahya. Victoria Station was crowded with enthusiastic well-wishers last night, including many Egyptians residing in Britain. When British Foreign Secretary Eden stepped forward to shake hands with General Nahas, the crowd shouted, "Long live Anglo-Egyptian friendship!" The Anglo-Egyptian treaty is scheduled to be formally signed on Tuesday morning in the historically significant Locarno Room of the British Foreign Office. This new treaty supplements the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1922. While that treaty significantly advanced Egyptian independence, it still contained numerous reservations, such as the British right to station troops in Egypt, the future of the Sudanese government, the defense of the Suez Canal, and the consular jurisdiction over legal cases involving foreigners. These matters remained unresolved. Although the contents of the new treaty have not yet been officially released, the following outline is believed to be reliable: (1) The treaty constitutes an alliance and seeks amity between the two countries. (2) British troops will withdraw from Cairo and be stationed in Ismailia. (3) The defense of the country and the Suez Canal will ultimately be the responsibility of Egypt, but the number of British troops will not be reduced until the Egyptian army is sufficiently strong. (4) Egypt will construct military roads to facilitate rapid troop transport between the eastern and western parts of the country. (5) The British air force stationed in Egypt will be significantly increased, and new airfields may be built in Abu Qir and Ismailia. (6) Britain will establish an important naval base in Alexandria, and may also establish an army base there. Britain will pay rent for the occupied areas. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>"Queen Mary" Breaks Speed Record; Returns from the US Faster than French Ship, Wins Blue Riband</h3>
<p>(New York) The "Queen Mary" liner arrived at Ambrose Lightship at 4:12 AM (British Standard Time) this morning, taking four days, seven hours, and twelve minutes from her departure from Cherbourg. Her average speed was 30.01 nautical miles per hour. The French liner "Normandie" set the transatlantic speed record on her maiden voyage at four days, eleven hours, and forty-two minutes, averaging 29.94 nautical miles per hour. She departed from Cowes, a journey 50 miles longer than the "Queen Mary's." However, to win the Blue Riband for Atlantic crossings, the "Queen Mary" must surpass last year's "Normandie" east-to-west transatlantic speed record of 30.31 nautical miles per hour. This victory, for the west-to-east crossing, is, according to White Star Line, four hours and thirty minutes faster than the "Normandie's" record, with an average speed increase of 0.36 nautical miles per hour.

<p>(Berlin) The German government announced today that it is immediately banning the export of arms, ammunition, and other war materials to Spain. The German government is taking this step because the countries concerned have agreed in principle to participate in the neutrality agreement proposed by the French government. This ban has been communicated to the German government through diplomatic channels. The communication stated that the dispute between Berlin and Madrid regarding the seizure of a German aircraft by the Spanish authorities has not yet been resolved. The current ban does not affect the need to resolve this dispute. The German government hopes that other countries concerned will also implement this ban promptly without delay. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Mongol Puppet Bandit Army Prepares to Invade Sui on a Large Scale; Sui Army Reinforces Defenses in Taolin and Other Areas</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou dispatch: Puppet bandit Wang Ying went to Chahar North at the beginning of the month, gathered over a thousand bandits, and occupied Shangdu, intending to disturb Sui East. Wang bandit came to Zhangbei a few days ago and, in addition to contacting certain parties for arms, reorganized the bandits in Zhangbei to concentrate training. It is now reported that Wang bandit's contact with arms matters has been allowed by certain parties to supply Wang bandit. It is decided that around the 25th of this month, Wang bandit will leave Zhangbei for Shangdu and gather the troops of Li Shouxin, Zhang Haipeng, and De Wang, totaling approximately 26,000 people, and will invade Sui East on a large scale in early or mid-September. Currently, De Wang is extorting horses and levying grain from the people of various counties in Chahar North in preparation for war. Zhang Haipeng's troops are currently stationed near the city of Bin County, with approximately two thousand bandits. Today (21st), a person from Suiyuan stated that if the bandit army invades Sui, the Jin-Sui army is determined to use all its strength to strengthen defenses in Xinghe Taolin and other places. It is also reported that the bandit army of De Wang, etc., is mostly a rabble, and many of the Mongol soldiers are quite wealthy and will never be willing to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Clears Scattered Bandit Groups; Provincial Government Formulates Pacification Plan</h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch: Various groups of Red bandits in southern and western Anhui, as well as large groups of local bandits such as Chen Sanbazi and Fu Jiafa in northern Anhui, have all been successively wiped out, leaving only scattered small groups that gather and disperse unpredictably. The provincial government has formulated the following pacification plan for thorough suppression: (A) Divide the suppression areas and investigate the bandit situation in various places. Several suppression areas will be divided, and senior personnel will be assigned to unified command, regardless of regional boundaries, to conduct strict searches and suppressions. All bandits in the province will be eliminated within this year. (B) Divide the defense tasks. Security teams will assist garrison troops in guerrilla warfare, while the militia teams will be responsible for guarding. The provincial police and militia teams should strengthen blockades. Nearby garrison troops and security teams should also go to assist in the suppression. After the bandits retreat, they should jointly follow up and pursue them to inflict heavy damage. If the bandits' trail is lost, the militia teams should use their familiarity with the terrain to conduct in-depth searches. As soon as the bandits are found, the security teams or garrison troops should quickly rush to suppress them. (C) Compile and check the Baojia household registration system. Local areas will be responsible for carefully compiling and training the Baojia system, implementing joint security and joint responsibility, strictly checking household registrations, and interrogating travelers to ensure that local ruffians cannot gain a foothold to cut off their collusion and support, and to ensure that scattered bandits who are defeated cannot hide. Eliminate the source of bandits. (D) Complete the construction of blockhouse projects to prevent unexpected bandit attacks. Using fewer to defend against more, using leisure to await labor, and using disparate shapes can have great effects. The blockhouses can also isolate traffic and control the flow of bandits. If the bandits are gathered in one place, the existing blockhouses can be used to build trenches and connect them into a blockhouse line to encircle and block them, and then annihilate them in one fell swoop. The construction of blockhouses in various parts of the province has been completed. There is a deadline to complete the city defense and provincial defense. Anqing is the political center of the province and the key to the Beijing-Hankou transportation route. In times of emergency, the defense is particularly important. This year, it is planned to repair the original city walls, dredge the moat, gather the necessary troops, and dig outer moats along the ponds on the outer sides of the mountains and hills outside the city. Then, artillery positions will be set up at Qipan Mountain, Lion Mountain, and other places. At the same time, heavy machine gun emplacements will be constructed and machine guns will be placed along the important locations on the river banks of the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to block the river surface with their firepower. As for the provincial defense, it is more necessary to quickly complete the preparations with the assistance of the central government. (August 23)</p>

After two interrogations, due to the seriousness of the case, Yu Ruixiang was released on written bail of 5,000 yuan, but was later detained for lack of bail. As for the reason for the arrest of the little doll, it was rumored that the male corpse found with knife wounds under the Xadiang Bridge on the 13th of this month was Wu, a missing member of the troupe, causing Yu and others to be heavily suspected of murder. The inside story of the case has now come to light. Wu Piaoping, the missing Shanghai opera male actor, was found in Shanghai the other day. Wu Piaoping's original name was Zhang Zishi, age 40, living in Dachang Township, Shanghai. He received higher education and previously worked in the business and education sectors. He was always fascinated by Shanghai opera, and had a close friendship with Zhu Guodi, who currently performs Shanghai opera at the Great World in Shanghai. Later, the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association was established, and he joined as a member and was hired as a secretary and director of the registration department. Therefore, he was very familiar with the leading actors of Shanghai opera. Since the opening of the Great World in the county, Wu was invited by Yang Liansheng to help in the opera team. All the little dolls and Shi Xiangyun were introduced and organized by Wu. Later, due to Shi Xiangyun listening to rumors and competing for the leading role, various disputes arose. Wu was blamed and left without saying goodbye on the evening of the 8th of this month, wearing a vest. He borrowed special funds from a friend in Suzhou and went to live at the Wu family in Shanghai's Dachang. On the morning of the 22nd, he took a steam bus back to Shanghai, went to Zhu Guodi's house in Beijings Road Feikangli to prepare travel expenses. Zhu then told him about the situation in Wuxi. At the same time, the mother of the little doll, Xu, entrusted her friend Wu Shutang to find him in Shanghai. He was found at Zhu Guobiao's house and immediately reported to the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association. The association held an emergency meeting, recommending Changwu Zhu Xiaofeng, Wang Shaofeng, and Shu Zujun, carrying membership certificates, and together with Wu Piaoping, arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai at 4 AM on the previous day (23rd) and stayed at the First Hotel. Yesterday (24th), a complaint was written and reported to the District Court at 8 AM. The judge Shen opened the court for interrogation. As a result, Yu Ruixiang was ordered to change to ordinary bail, and Shi Shaoqing and Yan Chungen each added a written bail of six yuan. Yang Liansheng was returned to prison for the opium case, and the others were ordered to return home pending review. At this point, the so-called sex scandal that had caused a storm in the city came to an end.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Rice Fields in Four Townships Damaged by Insects</h3>
<p>It is reported that rice fields in other provinces have a bumper harvest this year. However, in the four townships of Changshu, the autumn harvest has been greatly reduced due to insect damage. The weather was unusually hot when the rice seedlings were transplanted this summer. During the hot season, it suddenly turned cool again. As a result, the rice crops did not develop well. In the western townships, black ear disease (commonly known as "heart extraction") has occurred and is spreading rapidly. The agricultural extension institute has telegraphed the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, requesting them to send personnel to Changshu to investigate and find ways to save the crops.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Silkworm Cocoon Businesses Certified in Silkworm Area</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Silkworm Improvement Area distributed autumn silkworm seeds this term, with a total of 90,000 sheets distributed in various villages. Currently, a large number of autumn silkworms have been harvested, and the early batch has already reached the 1-2 instar feeding stage. The improvement area has separately collected statistics on qualified cocoon businesses and those that have not opened in three years. After verification, 35 businesses, including Hongtaichang and Tongfengzhai, have been certified and registered. As the date of the full autumn harvest is approaching, a list is specially reported to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee for review and filing.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Method for Stacking Salt</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongli, Director of the Lianghai Salt Affairs Tax Bureau, who was previously summoned to Shanghai by the General Office of Salt Affairs Inspection in Feng, to inquire about the Daisan salt farmers' rebellion, has completed his official duties and returned to Hangzhou. According to Zhang's discussion with reporters: (A) Regarding the method for stacking salt, the Engineering Office will, in conjunction with local authorities, designate the location of the stacking base, delineate the scope, and organize a council to evaluate the price of the stacking base. The price of the land will be paid to the owners at any time. The time for paying the salt will be from sunrise to sunset. (B) Regarding the method of changing the color of fishing salt, the pigment will be issued by the government, the fish salt brick storage will be built by the government, the baskets and carrying poles will be purchased by the government, and a request will be made to banking groups and financial groups to provide loans to relieve the fishermen.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Distribution of Autumn Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Sericulture Improvement Zone has decided to release a total of 50,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs this year. However, due to the large number of silkworm eggs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there is a general shortage, resulting in a significant shortfall in the estimated quantity. The Zhejiang Unified Control Council has specifically stipulated that the distribution will be at 80% to 90% of the determined number of eggs. Jiaxing can only distribute 36,000 sheets. Zheng Genquan, the director of the zone, believing that farmers are idle in the autumn and that raising autumn silkworms can provide some additional income, personally went to Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places to negotiate with various egg production farms and added 7,000 sheets from the two locations. Therefore, the distribution can be at 90% of the determined number. A large batch of silkworm eggs has now arrived in He, and distribution began successively on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Wuhu: Dachang Match Factory</h3>
<p>Wuhu is the commercial center of Anhui Province. In recent years, it has been affected by the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the market is quite sluggish. Since the successive opening of the Jiangnan, Huainan, and other railways and various highways, coupled with the abundant harvests of agricultural products in Anhui Province in both spring and autumn, Wuhu has become the tail end of transportation and sales, and the atmosphere is thriving. All sectors of the party and government, as well as local gentry, are implementing the industrial plan set by the late Sun Yat-sen, with Wuhu as an industrial zone, and are now恪遵the late leader's instruction to engage in resumption of work. Factories such as textile mills and match factories are all in the planning stage. According to recent reports, although there is a saying that a joint production and sales system will be implemented in the match industry, the Dachang Match Factory was leased by the Shanghai Dachina Match Factory in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China, first for five years and then renewed for another five years. However, Dachina only leased but did not operate, and the Dachang Factory was restricted by the contract. It had to wait until the lease expired on March 14 of this year before negotiating to terminate the contract. Therefore, on December 24 of the previous year, it submitted a request to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to take back the factory and operate it independently upon the expiration of the lease. The Ministry of Industry approved the request. At that time, the government did not impose restrictions on the match industry, and the so-called "Match Production and Sales Joint Operation Association Regulations" had not yet been approved and promulgated. Dachang's request was made earlier and should not be bound by it. This special situation must be appealed for relief. It is hoped that the government will take into account the facts, be fair and reasonable, and resolve the matter in order to prevent disputes.</p>
<h3>Taizhou: Intercepting Smuggling Ships</h3>
<p>The Silk, Lishi, and Shitang areas of Wenling are located on the coast, and smuggling is rampant. At midnight on the 16th, Chen Qifu, a local unscrupulous merchant, shipped another batch of smuggled goods from Taiwan, fully loaded on a large merchant ship, including white sugar and fertilizer. The ship sailed through Cheguan and stopped at the Shatao waters to entrust someone to sell and transport the goods. Due to lack of secrecy, Wu Liqing and Zhu Rongshou, local ruffians, learned of it. They immediately took up arms and led a group of people to board the ship and seize the goods. Later, Luo, the chief of the Houxiang bao, and Lin, a bao member, mediated. Chen Qifu was willing to pay 500 yuan in national currency to release the ship and sail it to the Diaobenglongzui waters. He wrote a receipt and set a deadline for the following day (the 17th) to pay the money. Later, because the cash could not be raised and the goods could not be unloaded, the incident was learned by the captain of the Shangmashishi Guard Team. He immediately reported to the team headquarters and dispatched troops to investigate and seize the ship. The incident was reported to the county government for instructions.</p>

The new cars will depart at 8:00 PM that evening, taking the Jinghu and Jinpu railways and transferring to the Longhai Railway to join the operation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hosted Tour</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway Bureau hosted a tour for people from all walks of life at the First Platform of the North Station of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau yesterday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. A total of more than 300 people attended, including Huang Boqiao, Yan Fang, Lin Jinyu, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, various shipping companies, and reporters from various newspapers. Yin Saidi Zhong, Director of the Longhai Railway Shanghai Liaison Office, and others cordially greeted the guests and accompanied them on a tour of the internal equipment of the new cars, and provided tea and refreshments. People from all walks of life praised the new steel cars.</p>

Cp. of Belgium, introduced by the Belgian Silver Company, for a total of 49 cars, including 5 first-class sleeping cars, 7 second-class sleeping cars, 5 first-class dining cars, 1 lounge car, 5 second and third-class combined cars, 15 third-class passenger cars, 5 baggage cars, and 5 postal cars, for a total cost of 3 million yuan. After the first batch of new cars was transported to China and assembled, it has been allocated to the Longhai Line for use. The second batch (i.e., the tour hosted yesterday) of 13 new cars has been fully configured. The third and fourth batches of new cars are also in the process of shipping and construction. The new cars are 21 meters long, the car body is 18 meters and 98 centimeters long, and the weight of the first and second-class sleeping cars is 45 tons, the first-class dining cars and lounge cars weigh 46 tons, and the second and third-class combined cars and third-class passenger cars weigh 43 tons.</p>
<p>Structural Features</p>
<p>All parts inside and outside the cars are made of steel plates. The bumpers at both ends of the cars are also made of steel. The structure is extremely strong and can resist the pulling force of 100 tons of trailers. Even in the event of an accident, it can provide passengers with the highest level of safety, and the weight of the car body has not increased. The outer walls of the car body are painted in light green, which is bright and flat, and there are no nail heads protruding. The inner walls are fitted with teak panels to prevent the intrusion of heat and cold. The steps for getting on and off the car retract into the car, and are covered with a cover plate. The car door must be opened first, and then the cover plate can be opened before getting on and off, which is not only elegant but also safe. The two cars are closely connected to each other, and it is very stable to pass through them.</p>
<p>Exquisite Layout</p>
<p>The berths in the cars are arranged using scientific methods. The first-class sleeping car has eight bedrooms. The upper berth is parallel to the car window, and the lower berth is perpendicular to the car window. The upper and lower berths are in a B-shaped position. The upper berth can be climbed with a steel ladder and is close to the top of the car without leaving any traces. When the lower berth is not in use, it can be used as a seat. In addition, there is a small table and a sofa chair. Between every two bedrooms, each room has two upper and lower berths, which can be folded freely. In the middle of the car, there is a large washroom that can accommodate four people washing at the same time. The first-class dining car is divided into three parts: dining room, living room, and kitchen. The dining room has four tables for four people and four tables for two people, which can accommodate 24 people dining at the same time. The living room has four tables for two people and two movable folding tables, which can be moved at will. The car windows are wide, and passengers can enjoy the scenery while dining. The lounge car is divided into three parts: living room, bedroom, and kitchen. The layout is slightly the same as the first-class sleeping car. The second and third-class combined car is divided into two parts: second-class and third-class seats. In the second-class seats, there are 13 double rattan chairs, with wide seats and backs that are appropriately inclined. The palm cushions and springs are moderately soft and hard. The layout of the third-class seats is the same as that of the third-class passenger car. The characteristic of the third-class passenger car is that there are only 84 seats in a 21-meter-long car, the width of the chair surface reaches 52 mm, and the empty distance between the chairs is also 525 mm. Even when the seats are fully occupied, there is also a weapon room for the armed escort team police.</p>
<p>Sanitary Equipment</p>
<p>In addition to the safety equipment (such as wind brakes, brake shoes, automatic adjusters, etc.) and the lounge car equipped with a氏暖汽 and a hot water stove, all the facilities for passengers and various sanitary equipment are available in each car and are of the latest style. The quilts, curtains, and miscellaneous items in the car are specially made by this railway to increase the comfort and interest of passengers.</p>
<p>Northbound Last Night</p>
<p>According to Chen Shouzhong, director of the Longhai Railway Shanghai Liaison Office, the second batch of new steel cars has been assembled and painted. The Longhai Line is in urgent need of new cars, so it has been approved to borrow the locomotives of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau tonight (i.e., last night) and drive along the Jinghu and Jinpu lines to Xuzhou, and then transfer to the Longhai Line. In order to entertain passengers, the railway has specially recruited dozens of receptionists. The receptionists are all high school graduates. It is believed that they will be able to provide attentive service to passengers.</p>

<h3>Citizen Training</h3>
<p>Inauguration of Director and Deputy Director</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Citizen Training Office was previously concurrently held by Wu Xingya, the late Director of the Social Affairs Bureau.

<h3>Explanation of the Method for Electing Medical and Pharmaceutical Professionals as Candidates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Medical Association previously learned that the election of candidates by the Lawyers Association should be handled by the Standing Committee. The association is also a committee-based organization. It is doubtful whether it should also be handled according to the example in the future when electing candidates. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Municipal National Assembly Representative Election Exchange for explanation. The Exchange replied that the reason why the Lawyers Association stipulates that candidates should be elected by the Standing Committee is that the Lawyers Associations in various places are all president-based, while Shanghai is the only one that is committee-based. The Medical Association was originally committee-based, and it can still follow the regulations and the Executive Committee can be the elector for the candidate of the medical and health group. It is reported that a reply has been sent to inform them.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Begins Door-to-Door Investigation of Unregistered Opium Smokers, and Inspects Licensed Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>The municipal opium smokers' general inspection, since the Municipal Government, together with Ma Liang, the anti-drug commissioner stationed in Shanghai by the Military Commission, separately submitted a report to the General Anti-Drug Directorate, and the deadline for the inspection work was approved to be extended to August 31, the Municipal Public Security Bureau followed the order to instruct the subordinate units to handle the matter. Now that the deadline for the inspection period is only one week away, the bureau, in order to eliminate opium smokers, has issued a notice to the police stations in each district to conduct door-to-door inspections of unregistered opium smokers, and to inspect whether the licensed opium smokers are providing private smoking for others. If it is found, they will be severely punished according to law.</p>

<h3>Joint Announcement from the Ministries of Finance and Railways: Reorganization of the Longhai Railway, Methods for Repaying Principal and Interest, Reducing Interest by Approximately 15,000,000 Yuan; Additionally, Two Belgian-Dutch Advances Also Reorganized, and a Jointly Formed Fund Management Committee Will Be Responsible for Custody</h3>
<p>Reorganization Process</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Railways' reorganization of the Longhai Railway's debts, according to Central News Agency reporters' inquiries, since the first year of the Republic of China, foreign debts were successively borrowed from Belgium, France, and the Netherlands for construction. During the European War and due to domestic turmoil, the borrowed funds could not be fully issued as bonds. Subsequently, loans were repeatedly taken from Belgian and Dutch companies. However, since the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, principal and interest payments have been overdue. As of now, the accumulated principal is approximately 150,000,000 yuan, and the interest is approximately 100,000,000 yuan, totaling approximately 150,000,000 yuan in national currency. In recent years, representatives of the Belgian company have repeatedly urged a reorganization, but due to the incomplete construction of the railway, insufficient revenue, and the massive debt, the divergent opinions prevented any agreement from being reached. Recently, after our government announced the reorganization plans for the Tianjin-Pukou and Daqing Railways, the Belgian company representatives requested reorganization based on the same precedent. The Belgian, French, and Dutch ambassadors repeatedly protested to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Railways, urging a resolution. To maintain creditworthiness, our government sincerely negotiated a reorganization plan with the Belgian banking syndicate. After repeated discussions lasting nearly half a year, and overcoming numerous twists and turns, an agreement was finally reached. The reduction in interest, including past accrued interest and interest reduction until the start of principal repayment, amounts to approximately 15,000,000 yuan. This was achieved through the sincere cooperation of the Belgian, French, and Dutch parties. The detailed plan was announced yesterday by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways (see below). In addition, two Belgian-Dutch advances have also been reorganized. When the above reorganization plan is implemented, a fund management committee will be formed by the two banks and representatives of the bondholders, following the example of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, to be responsible for custody in order to ensure credibility. The agreed-upon arrangements for reorganizing the Longhai Railway debts have been approved by the 271st meeting of the Executive Yuan, then passed by the 19th meeting of the Central Political Committee, and subsequently by the National Government in Instruction No. 81 on August 18th of this year.</p>
<p>Announcement Content</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Railways issued the following announcement yesterday to restore the repayment of principal and interest for the following loans of the Longhai Railway: (1) The 1913 £4,000,000 British gold 9% loan; (2) The 1920-1923 30,750,000 Guilder Dutch currency 8% short-term bonds; (3) The 1920-1921 and 1923 137,743,000 Franc Belgian currency 8% short-term bonds; (4) The 1924 5,000,000 Yuan Chinese currency 8% short-term public bonds; (5) The 1925 11,250,000 Franc French currency 8% short-term bonds issued to repay the 1919 loan. (1) Starting from July 1, 1936, the interest rate will be 1.5% in the first year, increasing by 0.5% each year until it reaches 4% in 1941-1942. Afterwards, the interest rate will be fixed at 4%. The interest for the first five years will be paid at the end of each fiscal year, and then 2% interest will be paid on January 1st and July 1st of each year. (2) Starting from July 1, 1947, a fixed annual amount will be used to repay both principal and interest, with a maximum repayment period of 35 years. The annual amount will be used to pay interest first, with the remaining amount used for principal repayment. If the bond price is equal to or higher than the face value, the principal will be repaid through a lottery system. If the bond price is lower than the face value, the loan manager will consult with the Chinese government's representative to purchase the bonds on the market. If the bonds cannot be purchased on the market, the loan manager will publish advertisements to solicit bids, purchasing from those offering the lowest price. Regardless of whether the bonds are repaid through a lottery or purchased on the market, the total amount allocated for principal repayment each year will be fully utilized. Regarding the above five types of loans, the Chinese government has the right to provide advance notice of early repayment each time principal is repaid. (3) All the above principal and interest payments should be prioritized from the operating profits of the Xi'an to Luoyang and Kaifeng to Haikou sections. After the 1903 loans and advances for the Kaifeng to Luoyang (i.e., Bianluo) section are repaid and that line is incorporated into the Longhai Railway, the surplus at that time will be transferred to the above-mentioned debt repayment fund. (4) All overdue interest before July 1, 1936, is completely waived. (5) Bondholders who accept these terms should submit their bonds to the loan manager, who will affix a stamp and attach new interest coupons. All foreign taxes on the interest coupons and principal shall be borne by the bondholders. The above plan is the result of lengthy discussions between the Chinese government and the bondholder representatives. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways stated that the railway authorities will refer to the provisions of each loan contract to seek ways to improve railway administration, so that both the Chinese government and the bondholders can benefit.</p>
<h3>Municipal Knitting Industry: Measures to Prevent Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Knitting Industry Association, in order to prevent smuggling and safeguard the legitimate sales of goods, has announced the following key points to the industry in accordance with the regulations for inspecting smuggling: (1) Registration: All industry members in the city should report to the association the accurate quantities of their existing goods and materials, along with their tax documents for the raw materials, immediately for registration. The deadline for this registration is August 31st. (2) Reporting: After completing the above registration procedures, all new incoming goods and materials must be reported to the association promptly. At the end of each month, a list of sales and usage for the entire month must be reported to the association. (3) Obtaining Certificates: Products from city industry members that have been registered and verified by the association, and are deemed without suspicion, can apply to the association for the issuance of certificates for transportation to various locations, for identification purposes, to avoid misunderstandings and detentions.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Development Bureau: Decision to Establish Next Month, Working Capital Shared by Banking Syndicate</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Development Bureau, jointly organized by the Ministry of Industries and various banks, is scheduled to convene a board meeting next month to announce its establishment. Regarding the bureau's working capital, it has been decided that the participating banks will jointly form a banking syndicate to handle loans. Yesterday morning, reporters inquired with the participating banks about the formation and organization of the syndicate. According to sources, the syndicate will be formed after the official establishment of the Agricultural Development Bureau, and no action has been taken yet. The fixed assets and working capital of the Agricultural Development Bureau for this year amount to a total of 12,000,000 yuan, which can be used to handle all agricultural loans after the bureau opens. Therefore, the articles of association stipulate that the working capital has no fixed amount and will be determined by the Agricultural Development Bureau and the participating banks at the beginning of each year. This working capital is similar to a reserve fund, and the participating banks will convene a meeting to organize a banking syndicate and determine the name of the syndicate after the Agricultural Development Bureau opens. The idea of changing to a certain banking syndicate is still far from reality.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loan Syndicate: Loans of Over 2,000,000 Yuan, Current Lending Continues as Planned, No Motion for Reorganization</h3>
<p>The China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate, organized by nine banks, including the Bank of Communications, the Continental Bank, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Kuo Hua Commercial Bank, the Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the New China Trust and Savings Bank, the Chekiang Industrial Bank, and the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, is a well-organized agricultural syndicate. Its lending scope has extended to provinces such as Hebei, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Anhui. The lending targets are wheat seedlings in the spring and cotton seedlings in the autumn. The total lending amount for this year was decided at the board meeting in May, totaling 2,500,000 yuan, and the branch offices in various provinces have been disbursing the loans successively based on local needs, with good results. According to the syndicate, all lending is proceeding according to the original plan, without any changes or proposed reorganization.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Reviving the Countryside: Construction of Agricultural Warehouses Nearing Completion, Banking Sector to Send Personnel to Supervise, China Farmers Bank Loans 3,000,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that Anhui Province has had a bumper harvest of agricultural products this year, with the production of rapeseed and other crops several times higher than in previous years. Recognizing this, the Department of Finance and the Department of Construction are constructing provincial and county warehouses to avoid low prices harming farmers. Director Yang Mianzhong of the Department of Finance came to Shanghai to seek loans from the banking sector and a contract has been signed. The total amount of loans from the China Farmers Bank to Anhui Province has reached over 3,000,000 yuan. As the warehouses in Anhui Province are nearing completion, the banking sector will send personnel to supervise the lending. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction of Warehouses</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has formulated a plan to revive the rural economy and relieve farmers' financial difficulties, establishing specialized training institutions to train talent in warehouse management and agricultural technology. On the other hand, the provincial government is building warehouses in various counties, planning to construct over 130 warehouses in more than 30 counties throughout the province, with a capacity of 50,000 to 200,000 shi each, to store agricultural harvests. The loans are intended to enable farmers to avoid repeating the cycle of "selling new grain in May at low prices."</p>
<h3>Inland Waterways Shipping Association Letters Customs: Discussing Methods for Small Steamer Towing, Presenting Difficulties of Changing to Double-Row Towing, Maintaining the Three Methods of the Former Harbour Master</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inland Waterways Shipping Association sent a letter yesterday to the Harbour Master of the Jianghai Customs, stating: Regarding Harbour Master's Notice No. 15735 of July 20th of this year, concerning the change of methods for small steamers towing vessels between the Suzhou Creek mouth and the Jiangnan Shipyard wharf, instructing that all members be informed and comply, etc. The association considers this a technical navigation issue, greatly related to the duties performed by crew members, and especially significant to the safety of small steamer navigation. Therefore, the association's executive committee conducted detailed research, on-site surveys, and also consulted the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union to seek opinions. The conclusions are listed as follows: (1) The passenger ships towed by small steamers in Shanghai Port can be divided into three categories: 1. Company ships carrying passengers; 2. Wuxi fast boats; 3. Tow barges carrying cargo. Among the tow barges carrying cargo, there are many types and different formats. The ships towed by small steamers cover almost all types. It is difficult to arrange these ships, with varying lengths and heights, into double rows for towing. Even in fast-flowing currents, double-row navigation would be more dangerous. Single-row navigation can be determined. (2) Ordinary cargo ships relying on sails and oars for propulsion still require hiring another steamer to tow them in the turbulent currents of the Huangpu River. Small steamers towing various vessels, whether carrying passengers or cargo, do not have oars. If, to avoid the danger of changing to double-row towing, they are required to tow in one trip, it would not only hinder navigation time but also be difficult to implement in practice. (3) During ebb tide, the water flowing out of the Suzhou Creek mouth is turbulent, making it impossible to change to double-row navigation. (4) When entering the Suzhou Creek mouth, dismantling the double row into a single row during high tide is very likely to cause collisions with the park embankment, posing a significant danger. (5) There are many ships docked in the Suzhou Creek mouth area. Double-row towing can easily obstruct port traffic. (6) According to the actual survey conducted by the association, for small steamers with a gross tonnage of 30 tons or more, whether during high or low tide, towing six barges out of the Suzhou Creek mouth can be handled with ease. The above are all facts. Based on the findings of the research, the changes made by your esteemed Harbour Master to the small steamer towing methods may not reduce the dangers on the river surface or protect the safety of vessels, and are not beneficial. Regarding the management of traffic in the narrow and congested section of the Lujiazui Bay, the association received Notice No. 14535 from the former Harbour Master, Mr. Le Tintin, on August 3, 1933, stipulating three regulations regarding the route of small steamers. Since the implementation of the above three methods to this day, the dangers of navigation have indeed been greatly reduced. These methods, suitable for managing port administration and facilitating vessel navigation, should still be allowed to be retained. The association is deeply grateful for your esteemed Harbour Master's enthusiasm in protecting the safety of vessels. We have presented a detailed letter listing the difficulties of changing to double-row towing and the fact that it does not help protect the safety of small steamers. We sincerely hope that your esteemed Harbour Master will reconsider to achieve a better solution and avoid implementation difficulties. With sincere regards, to Harbour Master Tepeike of the Harbour Affairs Department.</p>
<p>Banking Sector Assistance</p>
<p>Loans will also be sought from the Shanghai-Wuhan banking sector. The China Bank, the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate, and others, have designated loans of 4,000,000 yuan for agricultural loans in more than 30 counties. The Director of Finance of the province has come to Shanghai to negotiate and sign a contract. The construction of warehouses in various counties of the province has made progress and is scheduled to be fully completed next month. It is learned that the provincial government will invite personnel from the banking sector to supervise the loan disbursement when all the warehouses are completed.</p>
<p>Loans from China Farmers Bank</p>
<p>Since receiving the order to issue 100 million yuan in legal tender, the China Farmers Bank has paid more attention to agricultural loans in various provinces. This year, Anhui Province is reviving the countryside and building warehouses, and the bank's loans are significant, with 700,000 yuan for cooperatives and 2,300,000 yuan for agricultural warehouse loans, totaling approximately 3,000,000 yuan, which will greatly help to relieve the farmers in the province.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Wheat Prices Rise: Japanese Merchants' Purchases Decrease, Chinese Merchants' Orders for Foreign Wheat Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the reporter visited Mr. Gu Xinyi yesterday morning. According to him, the Japanese merchants' purchase of wheat has decreased compared to before due to the rising wheat prices in our country. The government is conducting detailed research on issues such as the prohibition of wheat exports. The Flour and Grain Associations have not yet received approval from the ministry. The claim that Chinese merchants are purchasing foreign wheat is not confirmed. As for the price of Persian foreign rice, it is 6.5 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), which is roughly the same as the price of our country's wheat. However, only sample rice has been seen, and no transactions have been made.</p>
<h3>After Chen and Tang Return to Shanghai: Guangdong Branch Being Planned, Not Preparing to Go to Lushan, Branch Manager Selection in Progress</h3>
<p>Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Tang Shoumin, Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Li Tisheng, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai after inspecting the financial situation in Guangdong. Due to important matters to be handled, they did not prepare to go to Lushan to meet with Finance Minister Kong. Tang Shoumin told the Dagong News Agency reporter that Xu Zai, while in Guangdong, had telegraphed Finance Minister Kong on the inspection results, and that important matters such as the business direction, operating rules, and selection of a branch manager (the rumor that Song Zi'an will take the post is unconfirmed) for the establishment of branches of the Central Bank and other banks in Guangdong are being actively discussed. They will be sent to Lushan for Finance Minister Kong's approval within days, so there is no need for them to go to Lushan again. As for Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, as his mission is not yet completed, the date of his return to Shanghai has not been received.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Joint Treasury: Trust Department to be Established Within Days</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Treasury is establishing a trust department with a capital of 1,000,000 yuan, which has been allocated by the treasury. All preparations have been completed.

<h3>Income Tax: Questions on Implementation Rules, The "Debt" Character in Article 7 of Government Bonds is Likely Mistaken. Shen Liren Submits to Chief Gao for Instructions</h3>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that the "debt" character in "government bonds debt" in Article 7 of the Income Tax Implementation Rules has caused public confusion, with some suspecting it to be a mistake for the "accumulation" character of "accumulation fund." A single character's difference is of great importance. Accountant Shen Liren has specifically sent a letter to Chief Gao of the Direct Tax Preparatory Office for clarification. His original letter stated: (Omitted above) The Income Tax Implementation Rules were published in various newspapers the other day. Article 7 states, "The term 'capital' refers to the paid-up share capital of a company or the actual capital invested by other organizations. Those with government bonds, can calculate one-third of their total amount into the capital." The "debt" character of "government bonds" is often confused with the "accumulation" character of "accumulation fund." The meanings of the two are different, and they also have a large impact on the interpretation of the word "capital" and the calculation of income. A single character's difference seems significant. Ordinary mistakes are insignificant, but in this article, it is very important. Therefore, I respectfully submit this for clarification.</p>
<h3>Payment of Ministry Certificates, Land Tax and Other Fees: Deadline End of This Month, Land Will Revert to Public Ownership if Payment is Not Made by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau had previously set a deadline of the end of June for various households who should pay the Ministry Certificates, Land Tax, and other fees for applying for Ham Road and other lands to pay to the bureau to settle the case and issue certificates. Afterwards, there were still many people watching and waiting without paying by the deadline. Originally, the land should have been reclaimed by the city according to the liquidation method. However, in order to be more considerate, another two-month extension was announced, which ends at the end of this month. It is learned that there are only a few days left. If the payment is not made by the deadline, the bureau will separately cancel the original cases, assign personnel to prepare maps based on the actual land measured, and transfer them to the safekeeping department of the Finance Bureau. No further extensions will be granted.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital: July Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's July report states: Number of outpatient visits: 17,177; Number of new hospital admissions: 385; Number of inpatient days: 6,702; Average number of people provided with meals per month: 490; Male suicides: 57 cases; Female suicides: 62 cases; Emergency surgeries: 396 cases; Emergency surgeries for factory accidents: 45 cases; Patients sent by the British Concession Police: 470; Patients sent by the French Concession Police: 72; Deliveries: 20 cases. Overall, the statistics for July are consistent with past experience. The summer months show a surge, with outpatient and inpatient numbers increasing by over 10% compared to the previous month. Emergency surgeries also increased by approximately 20%. The increase in female suicides is a particularly tragic feature of July. There were 62 suicide cases, an increase of no less than 25% compared to the 48 cases in June. The common method of suicide is overdosing on opium, which is now easily obtainable and inexpensive. In 12 out of the 62 suicide cases, death occurred. Currently, only 50 cents can buy enough opium to kill a woman with a normal constitution. It is hoped that the authorities will make every effort to make it more difficult for the public to obtain opium. In July, there was a particularly pitiful patient who came to the hospital. The patient was a young man in his twenties from Nanjing, who had to have both arms and one leg amputated due to the spread of a lung infection. The outcome of this surgery, given the current difficult circumstances, is very good. It is planned to fit him with two prosthetic hands so that he can still earn a living when he leaves the hospital. The fitting of these prosthetic hands is free of charge. This is thanks to a generous donation from a famous Englishman in Shanghai, which is specifically for this purpose. However, this Englishman does not want his name to be publicized.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Formulates: Methods for Sending Beverages for Testing, Package Testing Fee of 50 Yuan, Send as Much as Possible for Testing Within One Year</h3>

However, each test will not be given a formal test report, only a written notification will be provided.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Loan: To Hold Meeting to Decide, Principles Already Submitted to Financial Group for Review, No Contact Yet with Shanghai Banking Sector</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Ministry of Railways is requesting the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board to borrow 3,000,000 yuan from the banking sector to complete the equipment for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Yesterday morning, a Dagong News Agency reporter specifically inquired with the banking sector in this city. According to sources, this loan was originally requested by the Ministry of Railways directly from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board. Because the Board's Boxer Indemnity funds were insufficient, the Board considered transferring the loan to banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for lending. However, the principles are still under review by the Board's financial group. There has been no formal contact with the banking sector. It is heard that the Board will hold a financial committee meeting within days to discuss and decide.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Steamers Reduce Miscellaneous Grain Freight Rates: China Merchants and Others Decide to Implement in Order to Compete with Private Vessels</h3>
<p>This port's China Merchants, Ning Shao, San Bei, Swire, and other four shipping companies, in order to compete with private shipping for freight, have specially reduced the freight rates for miscellaneous grains on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Our news correspondent has investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Private Vessels Competing for Transport</p>
<p>Recently, because private vessels have been actively registering with the customs, they are able to clear customs and transport goods in the same way as steamers, and have therefore become quite developed. This is especially true for the close Shanghai-Ningbo route, where there are many private vessels traveling back and forth. These private vessels all have a considerable history, so they have a good reputation with merchants. Furthermore, private vessels have limited expenses and simple operations, so their prices for transporting passengers and goods are lower than those of steamers. Although the delivery time is slower than that of steamers, merchants are generally calculating based on the freight costs, and speed is secondary. As a result, the freight business of steamers is greatly threatened. The impact is even more pronounced on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, which is a near-sea route.</p>
<p>Reducing Freight Rates</p>
<p>This port's China Merchants, Ning Shao, San Bei, Swire, and other four shipping companies, therefore, convened a meeting some time ago. As a result, they decided to reduce the freight rates for miscellaneous grains on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The freight rate for soybeans and rice will be reduced from 36 cents per hectoliter to 32 cents, with a further 20% discount. The freight rate for wheat flour will be reduced from 11 cents per bag to 10 cents, in order to compete with private vessels. A notice has been sent to Shanghai and Ningbo merchants and firms, stating that this will be implemented immediately to show their preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Chen Cheng, director of Pu'an Hospital on Fair Road in Hongkou and head of surgery at Renji Hospital, was sued in the First Special District Court by a woman, Madam Ma Dong, for causing the death of her son, Ma Laoda, due to professional negligence. The court had repeatedly summoned Chen and ordered the submission of Chen's diagnosis and other documents to the Forensic Institute for examination. This has been reported in this newspaper multiple times. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide held a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court and released the report from the Forensic Institute, which stated that the results of the examination showed that Chen's diagnosis was correct and that this type of treatment was necessary.

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Announces Winner of South Wharf Porterage Contract</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau solicited bids for the porterage contract for the South Wharf and opened the bids on the 20th of this month. It is reported that the bureau reviewed the bids and followed the methods used for previous wharves.

As a result of the review, the lowest bid price for this South Wharf was 62.8%, and the second lowest bid price was the same for two bids, both at 63.5%. The difference between the first and second bid prices was only 0.7%.

Among them, Li Huanxin was particularly superior. Therefore, Li Huanxin was selected as the winner, and Qiu Dinglai was the alternate winner. The other bids did not meet the requirements.</p>

<p>The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Second Special District District Court in this city were established on August 1st, 1931, after the French Concession's Public Court was recovered. In addition to the existing buildings being converted into courtrooms, the offices of both courts were located at No. 10 Heng'an Lane on Avenue Petain and in the He Mei Fang on Avenue Joffre (opposite the courtroom). Both were privately owned residences, and the annual rental expense was very high. For the past five years, the amount has been considerable. Since Mr. Yang Peng, the new president of the Higher Court Third Branch, took office, he has recognized this and specially planned to imitate the style of the Higher Court and First Special District Court in the Public Concession and build a new building, combining the two courts into one place and dividing the offices. There is now a vacant lot of the French Municipal Council on the east side of the courtroom, which is suitable for this purpose. A report has been submitted to the Judicial Administration Department for approval and is being actively pursued. On the one hand, negotiations are underway with the French Municipal Council to purchase the land. On the other hand, an architect has been commissioned to draw up plans for a five-story building. It is heard that the Ministry has allocated 150,000 yuan, but the estimated cost of purchasing the land and building the house is over 180,000 yuan, a difference of over 30,000 yuan. Construction will begin as soon as the land purchase procedures are completed and the funding is resolved.</p>

The day before yesterday afternoon, Lou gave her another five yuan and asked her to go out with him. Because her clothes had no pockets, she placed the money in her sock. But because she was wary of the past, she was unwilling to go with him, and Lou accused her of snatching the money. Lou, hearing this testimony, admitted that he had invited Wang out for refreshments. Judge Feng questioned them and found Wang Fengying guilty of theft, sentencing her to 30 days of detention, but suspended the sentence for two years in consideration of her first offense.</p>

At that time, Chen Xinyuan (also known as Chen Yingquan, 31 years old), a graduate of Fudan University from Guangdong Province, strongly supported her, almost every night. In June, Pan left Vienna due to an incident and helped out at the Da Hu Dance Hall. After about ten days, she entered the Da Metropolis Dance Hall as a dance partner through Chen's introduction. From then on, the two became even closer, going in and out together. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last. Recently, Pan and Chen became irreconcilable. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 22nd) at about 8:00 AM, Pan, along with her father Pan Dongfu and lawyer He Qi, went to the Lao Zha Police Station to accuse Chen Xinyuan of forcibly raping her on the 3rd of this month in Room 327 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road, requesting arrest.

Yesterday morning, Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a complaint under Article 227 of the Criminal Code for sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16. Chen Xinyuan also retained lawyers Jiang Baoli and Yang Ruinian to defend him. Because the case involved morals, Judge Feng Shide declared a ban on spectators. As a result, the hearing was rescheduled. Chen was released on 3,000 yuan bail. Chen admitted to the relationship with Pan, but claimed that in addition to the three times at the Dongya Hotel, they had a relationship in other places four more times, and that all of it was with Pan's consent.

<h3>Qiu Jiang Wharf Robbery Case Develops; Five More Suspects Apprehended, Tobacco and Soil Boxes Recovered; Involves Deputy Leader of Zhoupu Township and a Deputy Boat Owner</h3>
<p>On the evening of June 27th of this year, near midnight, a lighter belonging to the Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, loaded with 39 boxes of cigarettes of various brands, including Golden Mouse, Mao Ling, Little Fairy, Red Seal, Golden, Pin Hai, Old Knife, and Red Tin, was robbed of 37 boxes worth $6,060 at the Qiu Jiang Wharf. The robbers escaped without a trace. The company offered a reward for their capture. Half a month later, customs patrol officers arrested four suspects, Sheng Da, Shi Lang Yin Lang, Gu Er Lang, all from Chongming, and Wang Zhang, the wife of the fugitive Wang Jinsheng, behind the labor camp in Pudong, in a thatched hut. They confessed that the stolen goods were hidden in Zhoupu, Nanhui County, Pudong. More than ten detectives were dispatched to the countryside to pursue the matter. They discovered that the case involved Wu Jiasheng, deputy leader of the Xiukang Township Defense Corps in the fifth district of the county, and Pan Xukui, deputy leader of the Xiunan Township in the third district and leader of the first pai of the seventh jia of the county Defense Corps (previously misreported as the bao chief of the sixth bao of Xiukang Township). They then joined forces with the chief of the first resident office of the county Public Security Bureau and Zhoupu Defense Corps officials to conduct a thorough search and arrest. They arrested Zhang Cailin, Shen Jialu, Wu Jiasheng, and three other suspects. Approximately 27 boxes of cigarettes were found in the ancestral graveyard east of Pan's house. The entire Pan Xukui family had fled without a trace. The case caused a sensation throughout the county and became a common topic of discussion. The water patrol police handed over the three suspects, along with the three men and one woman arrested earlier, to the local court for trial. The recovered stolen goods were returned to the Yongtaihe Company for identification. More than a month later, the water patrol police received another tip that the fugitives were hiding. On the previous day, they arrested Yang Rongsheng (aged 35, from Jiangbei, also known as Da Zaozi) at the intersection of Han Bi Li Road and You Heng Road in the Public Concession. Yang confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices. They then went to No. 36 Hua Ji Road and arrested Xu Fengzao (aged 36, from Haizhou, also known as Xu Gu). Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Chui opened the trial. Because the Public Concession police had determined that Yang Rongsheng was involved in the Yulin Road robbery case, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation on September 2nd. Xu Fengzao was ordered to be handed over to the water patrol police for questioning. Xu confessed that after the stolen goods were transported to Wang Baoming's house in Zhoupu, they hired Zhang Xiaodi's No. 29690 pier boat to transport five boxes to the Nanchang Tobacco Shop in Dayuan, where they were sold. Subsequently, Wang Baoming, Wu Jiasheng, Kang Zhijun, and others hired Wu Sanhe's No. 6832 pier boat to transport the remaining stolen goods to Pan Xukui's house for storage. Upon obtaining this information, the patrol police chief sent detectives to Dongjiadu in the South City and impounded the two boats used to transport the stolen goods pending further investigation. Because ten boxes of cigarettes were still missing and important suspects such as Pan Xukui and Wang Baoming were still at large, they ordered a strict search to bring them to justice.</p>

At this moment, Wu became very anxious, thinking that after the search, the bandits would surely search him for cash. In desperation, he threw away the small leather bag and ran west, shouting for help along the way. The three bandits knew that Wu must have money on him, so they chased him closely. At the west end of No. 4 Bridge, they encountered Liu Bingrong and Zang Ding, detectives from the Xinzha Detective Squad, who were inspecting pedestrians in the area. Hearing someone being chased, they intercepted Wu Bo'ying first. After learning the situation, the three bandits, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, immediately fled in different directions. The detectives blew their whistles, and members of the fourth team of the Penggui District Defense Corps rushed out to surround and arrest them. As a result, two people were captured: Liu De'ya, 29 years old, from Funing, who was the main suspect in the robbery of the Zhongyu Road tofu shop and resisting arrest by opening fire on the morning of May 24th; and Jin Lianbao, 23 years old, from Yancheng, who is also a suspect. Another accomplice, Wang Yanzhuang, is still at large and is also a wanted criminal. The case has been transferred to the Xinzha Branch Bureau.</p>

<h3>Haimen Robbery and Arson Case; Wanted Criminal Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In May of this year, a robbery and arson case occurred in Meijia Town, Qidong County, which is part of Haimen County. At that time, Shen, the head of the first district, was burned to death by bandits. In August, the homes of Song Tianwu and Xu Ziyuan, a bao chief, were robbed by a gang. The police immediately began a strict investigation of the criminals involved. Xu Hongfu, a secret agent from Qidong County, learned that Dai A'gang and Xu Renchang (aka Xu Shibao), both from Haimen, were highly suspected of being involved in the above cases. However, after the incidents, Dai and Xu went into hiding at No. 20, Lane 234, Mabai Road, West Shanghai, in the Public Concession. On the previous day, Xu came to Shanghai and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police. Detective Zhou Tongchun was dispatched to the Pudong Road Police Station to assist the Chinese and Western detectives in arresting Dai A'gang and Xu Renchang at that address. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Zhang Tianyin, in addition to stating the facts of the case, requested a postponement because the investigators from Qidong County had not provided sufficient evidence. Furthermore, Xu Hongfu, the investigator from Qidong County, reported to the court that the two defendants were involved in the robbery and arson case and could be identified by an eyewitness in the future. When questioned, Dai and Xu denied any wrongdoing. Judge Huang ordered the two defendants to be detained pending another hearing next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Fight Over Smoking; Husband Dies Suddenly; Suspected; Husband Suffered from Hernia; Will Be Sent for Forensic Autopsy</h3>
<p>Yang Cailin, 46 years old, from Ningbo, worked as a butcher. He and his wife, Xue (32 years old, from Ningbo), lived at No. 516 Wuding Road. However, the couple had a poor relationship, leading to frequent quarrels. At 10:50 PM on the 22nd of this month, Yang and Xue argued because she was smoking a cigarette. The argument escalated into a fight. Yang was knocked to the ground by Xue's punches and kicks. Yang suffered from a hernia, and after falling to the ground, he urinated all over the floor and his complexion changed drastically. Neighbors Huang Jinbiao and the maid Du Shi went outside and called for the ambulance from No. 2451 Chinese police station. Yang Cailin was taken by ambulance to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. However, he died before reaching the hospital. The body was sent to the autopsy center on Peilun Road. The Gordon Road police station ordered detectives to arrest Yang Xue and send her to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special Court. Police Attorney Zhang Tianyin charged her with manslaughter under Article 277, Section 2 of the Criminal Code and stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement pending the results of the autopsy. Witnesses Huang Jinbiao and Du Shi testified that they heard Yang and his wife fighting and went to mediate. However, Yang Cailin was punched in the head by Yang Xue and immediately fell to the ground, unable to speak, with a pale face. It was also revealed that the deceased had suffered from hernia. When questioned, Yang Xue confessed that around 10 PM the previous night, she took the half-smoked cigarette her husband had left on the table and smoked it, which led to an argument and a fight. She admitted to kicking her husband in the shoulder. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the defendant to be detained pending another hearing on the 31st of this month. The prosecutor's office appointed Prosecutor Zhang to inspect the body. It was determined that the cause of Yang Cailin's death was unclear and should be determined by a forensic autopsy. The body was released to Yuan Zugu Chen Yeshi.</p>
<h3>Supervisor of Sincere Shanghai Branch Huang Huannan Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang Huannan, supervisor of the Sincere Shanghai branch, was from Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, and 80 years old. Sixty years ago, he went to Sydney, Australia, to study. Later, he founded the Guang Sheng He Department Store in Keene Street, pioneering the department store business. In 1913, he returned to China. At that time, prominent overseas Chinese businessmen Ma Yingbiao, Ma Yongcan, Zheng Gansheng, and Cai Xing were establishing the Sincere Company in Hong Kong.

He also served as a director of the Shanghai Commercial Bank, Xinhua Foreign Company, Sincere Life Insurance, and the Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai. Although he was very old, he was still vigorous and went to the company to manage affairs every day. He was also very friendly and approachable. He had only occasionally felt unwell and rested at home. Recently, his condition worsened and he passed away. The funeral is scheduled for 9:00 PM today at his residence on Laobazi Road, with the burial on the afternoon of the 27th at 1:00 PM. Many people from all walks of life have expressed their condolences.</p>

<h3>Sanbei and Pinghan Railway Negotiating Water-Land Intermodal Transport; If Progress Smoothly, It Can Be Implemented Within the Year</h3>
<p>Domestic intermodal transport has been developing rapidly in recent years and has achieved considerable results, providing convenience for transportation and increasing profits. Last year, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways jointly convened shipowners to discuss intermodal transport methods. State-owned shipping companies, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, have successively launched programs, and the progress has been smooth. To adapt to the environment and facilitate freight transport in order to revive the endangered shipping industry, private shipping companies in Shanghai are negotiating intermodal transport with the Pinghan Railway. Sanbei Steamship Company has also sent representatives to negotiate several times. Both parties have expressed their sincerity. However, there is no concrete plan yet. Until recently, there was some initial progress. The matter is being actively prepared. If the progress is smooth, the private Sanbei Company and the Pinghan Railway's water-land intermodal transport can be implemented first this year. Afterwards, larger private shipping companies can continue to participate in the intermodal transport business.</p>
<h3>China Flying Club Cautious About Student Physicals</h3>
<p>China Flying Club is the first and only civilian aviation training institution in China. Since the start of training for the first class of students on June 18th, the results have been excellent. In addition to the previous dismissal of a student with slow comprehension and poor flight ability, Jiang Weichuan, a student, recently submitted a voluntary report stating that he "recently suffered from neurasthenia, dizziness, blurred vision, palpitations, and tinnitus. Medication has not been effective. I would like to request leave to return home for long-term recuperation and retain my student status so that I can re-enter the second phase of training when I regain my health." Yao Xijiu, secretary of the club, verified the facts and reported them to President Wu Tiecheng, who approved his withdrawal and refunded his tuition. This shows the club's caution regarding the physical condition of its students.</p>

<h3>Two Apprentices Missing</h3>
<p>Shiye News reports that Fei Changhuan, 16 years old, a graduate of Menghe Elementary School, and Ma Huade, 17 years old, a graduate of Wujin Public Elementary School, both apprentices at Renshoutang Chinese Pharmacy at the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpanlu, have gone missing. Fei had been apprenticing in the shop for over two years, while Ma had only been there for three or four months. Both are from Wujin, Jiangsu Province. They are both concerned about national affairs and have asked relatives and friends to introduce them to the military, hoping to serve the country. Friends have repeatedly dissuaded them, but their desire to serve the country has not diminished. At 11:00 AM on the 11th of this month, Fei suddenly left the shop on the pretext of using the restroom and went into hiding elsewhere. Around 9:00 PM, he called Ma and asked him to go with him. Ma made an excuse to take a bath and left the shop to flee. The shop owner and colleagues noticed and searched everywhere, but they are still missing.</p>
<h3>Mistress Punished for Abusing Maid; Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</h3>
<p>At about 6:00 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, the Yu Lin Road Police Station received a report from Zhao Jian, an official of the China Children's Relief Society, stating that Zhou Wang, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 6, Deming Lane, Lane 643, Huishan Road, abused her 11-year-old maid, Du A'gui, frequently beating her with firewood, causing bruises all over her body, and not allowing her to eat enough. Detective Pan Yunlong was dispatched to arrest Zhou at the address and brought her and the maid A'gui to the police station, transferring her to the women's prison. A'gui was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for examination. The most severe injuries were to her buttocks, with internal bruising caused by the beatings. Yesterday, Zhou Wang was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the girl Du A'gui was bought from her mother in Ningbo and it was said that she was to be married to Zhou's younger brother in six months. She should not be abused at will. The hospital's injury report was submitted for review. Du A'gui was afraid of Zhou and did not dare to tell the truth. The defendant's statement was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Zhou Wang to one year and six months imprisonment as a warning. Du A'gui was sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society for care.</p>
<h3>Zhao Xiangsheng Accused of Bigamy; Separated from Wife in Hometown; Married Another Woman</h3>
<p>Zhao Xiangsheng (also known as Fengzhang), 36 years old, a manager of Zhentai Southern Goods Store at No. 9, Lane 870, Haining Road, from Baoshan, married Li Pinzhen in 1921. Later, Zhao came to Shanghai to do business and left Li in his hometown. Due to disagreements, they officially separated on April 23, 1933. On April 25th of that month, Zhao married a woman surnamed Yang (22 years old) from Shaoxing at the Yanghuo Gonghui, Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, and lived with her at No. 9, Lane 858, Haining Road. Li learned of this and filed a bigamy lawsuit against Zhao in the First Special District Court. However, due to procedural irregularities, the court ruled that it would not be accepted. Recently, Li hired a lawyer to report the matter to the Laozha Police Station, requesting a public prosecution. After investigation by Chinese detective Jia Jiaju, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution against Zhao Xiangsheng and Zhao Yang in accordance with Article 237, Section 1 of the Criminal Code for bigamy. Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court of the Special Court summoned them for a hearing. Neither defendant appeared. A lawyer appeared in court and stated that Yang was ill and Zhao had left Shanghai, so neither could attend. He requested a postponement. Police lawyer Wang stated that the defendants had not provided proof of their absence and requested that the court issue a warrant for their arrest if they did not appear again. The court then postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Yangshupu Floating Corpse Identified as Wang Jiapeng</h3>
<p>Wang Jiapeng, a 20-year-old man from Wuxian, was a partner at Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company at No. 1 Rendeli, Xilin Road, Zhaozhou Road, outside the Old West Gate. He was unmarried and usually silent. He boarded at the company and his monthly income was enough to support himself. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, he left to mail some goods to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road and then went to the Lanhua Advertising Company on Ningbo Road to deliver a manuscript. He did not return that night. The next day, people were sent to inquire, and it was confirmed that the goods and manuscript had been mailed, but after many days, there was still no news. Therefore, the Chinese Concession Police Department was notified to investigate. Yesterday, Wang's elder brother Jia Yan and family members learned the news, came to Shanghai from their hometown in Suzhou, and went with the company's manager, Zai Minghu, to inquire at the South Pier Rescue Bureau. They learned that a floating corpse had been recovered from the Yangshupu River the day before. The body was wearing a white cloth short shirt, black silk pants, tied with a white cloth bamboo knot, barefoot, and had a light red cotton sock in its pocket. Although the face had decomposed, the clothing was identified as Wang Jiapeng's belongings. Therefore, they purchased clothing and a coffin for burial. The reason for the suicide is unknown. According to the company's employees, the deceased had sometimes talked about jumping into the Huangpu River, which unfortunately came true.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Xi Shiying, the person concerned, the "Shen Bao" newspaper published a news item on the 21st of this month in the "Local News" section, entitled "Content of the Case of Li Shu Company's Embezzlement," which is a new opening. It not only reverses the facts but also damages Shiying's reputation. Yan Gong, the accountant of the Lida Company, embezzled more than 5,000 yuan from the company's accounts and fled to Hangzhou. The company reported the case to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which sent officers to arrest the suspect in Hangzhou and bring him back to Shanghai. He fully confessed to the embezzlement and was sentenced to six months imprisonment and two years of probation by the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court on the 5th of this month. After that, Yan Gong came forward to request permission to publish an advertisement in the newspaper, saying that there was a slight misunderstanding with the company, which led to the lawsuit, in order to reduce the difficulty in finding another job. At that time, the company did not agree to the request because it was far from the truth. Now, the news in the "Shen Bao" states that the company's accountant was accused of embezzlement and that there is obviously another background, which is all based on one-sided facts and is purely speculation. As for all the accounts when the company was reorganized, they have been checked by the old shareholders and there is no fraud, which damages Shiying's reputation. Therefore, we specially request the "Shen Bao" newspaper to correct this. According to this, we hereby request that you make a thorough correction. To the "Shen Bao" newspaper, Lawyer Dang Wanghou, August 24th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Our association held a solicitation meeting yesterday, with Mr. Chu Fuxin as the temporary chairman. Your newspaper mistakenly wrote Xie Shuren, which should be corrected. To the "Shen Bao" newspaper, Shanghai Silver Money Industry Amateur Friendship Association Preparatory Office, August 24th.</p>
<p>Errata: In yesterday's "Summary" column, "Ci Han committed the crime of Hu Dahai Zhou Shiping, imprisoned and escorted to Shanghai," the word "Shanghai" was mistakenly printed as "Hong Kong." In the "Local News" column, "Four British Giant Ships Allegedly Purchased by Japanese Merchants," in the subtitle, the "Shipping Association 'Denies' Purchase by Chinese Merchants," the word "Denies" was mistakenly printed as "Should." A difference of one word reverses the meaning, and it should be corrected immediately.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The sky around Shandong is cloudy, with northeasterly to southeasterly winds.

The center of the hurricane was within about 60 miles of 22 degrees 20 minutes north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM. The wind force is fierce. Also, the highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 86.0 degrees and the lowest was 72.3 degrees.

<h3>The World Games Open, Every Home Hung Flags and Decorations, Resembling Our Country's New Year Scene - Letter from Li Huitang to this Newspaper</h3>
<p>I have been in Berlin for another ten days. (Although the weather here is said to be summer, it is quite similar to the early winter in our country, and the days are short and the nights are long, which is especially strange. The sky dawns at four o'clock in the morning, and the lights are turned on at nine o'clock in the evening.) It is comfortable to live in "Summer Peck Village", and the sleep and food are good, which is gratifying. The conference opened today, presided over by the German head of state "Hitler", with more than 100,000 spectators, an unprecedented grand occasion. The whole city of Berlin is in "Summer Peck Heat", with every home hanging flags and decorations like the New Year scene in our country. Our team entered the arena in order, with Hui as the flag bearer. The flag was large and the pole was heavy, and it took almost three hours. After the event, both hands were sore, which was unbearable. However, it is also sweet to work hard for the country. The transmission of the torch of the conference is especially interesting. The torch was first transmitted from the "Summer Peck" city of Greece (starting on July 20). From that place to Berlin, it is more than 3,000 kilometers. The transmitters walked one kilometer with a torch. The whole journey took more than ten days, with more than 3,000 people. And the last one to arrive at the end of the conference venue was also at the fourth act (evening of August 1st).</p>
<p>Italian Players are Rude, Brutal, and Wild</p>
<p>The conference started with competitions. In the past two days, our country's athletes (track and field) have all failed and did not even qualify for the preliminary round. The distance from the world level can be said to be far away. The Central News Agency has already sent special telegrams about the situation. Our team went to watch the football match between Italy and the United States today. The Italian team's skills were excellent, the performance was pure and skilled, the energy was sufficient, and the running was agile. Unfortunately, they acted on impulse, and they were brutal, wild, and unprecedented. Therefore, although the result was a victory (1 to 0), it was also despised by the audience. Taking advantage of the moment, the reputation will stink forever (the left back was expelled from the arena), which is not advisable. The United States also played quite well, but the shooting skills were not very good, and they could not reverse the defeat, which is a pity. Their fighting spirit was excellent and won the sympathy of the audience. Defeat is not a disgrace. (Norway beat Turkey 3-1 on the same day) (evening of August 3rd).</p>
<p>Germany's Football Achievement is Very Profound</p>
<p>The track and field competition continued today. The representatives of our country bid farewell one after another (we jokingly call the losers graduation). In the afternoon, we went to watch the football match between Germany and Luxembourg. As a result, Germany won a big victory with 9 to 0 (?). The German team's transcendence of football skills is even better than Italy. It is enough to make us open our eyes and guard the forest. The rapid advancement and the infinite changes in strategy and the orderly position are all enough for us to learn from. Moreover, each football skill has reached the top level, and the outstanding performance of the header is especially remarkable. It is heard that Germany has the guidance of famous British teachers and has more practice. The speed of its progress and the excellence of its cooperation are not without reason. Our country's football has been stagnant for the past 20 years. It is imperative to hire elite coaches and trainers, but I don't know if the authorities can thoroughly plan it. On the individual side of the Luxembourg team, there are also good players, but the lack of understanding and a mess, there is no fixed strategy. The importance of cooperation in football can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Sweden Deceived the Enemy and Lost to Japan</p>
<p>Also, Japan won over Sweden by 3 to 1 on the same day, creating an unprecedented upset. Afterwards, it was heard that Sweden deceived the enemy. The Japanese fighting spirit was excellent. In the first half, they lost by two to zero, but they reversed the defeat in the second half, which shows that arrogance will lead to defeat, and the victory or defeat of football is not only based on the superiority or inferiority of football skills, which is even more believed. (Evening of August 4th) Our team will play against England on the 6th, and the loss may be unavoidable. However, you have been working hard these days, and I am confident that there will be a good performance. More details later. Tang Hui, morning of August 5th.</p>
<p>The World Games opened. Our country's athletes entered the arena.</p>

<p>The Xianfang Cup Tennis Tournament will probably end within this month. Yesterday, we received a bunch of results reports from the Huaqiang team. The situation of each team has changed rapidly. At present, except for the championship position, Lingnan is difficult to shake. Mei Lu has jumped to the front, ranking second with 98 points. However, because Youxing and Kangti have more unplayed times, they have more opportunities. Therefore, who belongs to the runner-up has become a matter of interest. The results of each game this week should be revealed. The situation of each team and the results of the makeup games are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Australia Proposes to Launch the Women's Davis Cup, the British Lawn Tennis Association Does Not Express Approval and Points Out Various Difficulties and Questions</h3>
<p>(London Reuters) The Australian Lawn Tennis Association has proposed to launch a World Women's Tennis Championship, completely imitating the Davis Cup method. Brooks, the president of the Australian Lawn Tennis Association and former Wimbledon champion, is willing to donate this silver cup. However, according to Poli, the president of the British Lawn Tennis Association, Britain cannot fully support this plan. It is not easy to succeed from a sports or commercial point of view. The public is not as interested in women as they are in men. Therefore, the funding is also a question. Some female tennis players travel abroad for more than six months and are always reluctant to go again. Poli also pointed out a fact that when the British women's team went to France to compete two years ago, there were very few spectators.</p>
<h3>European Tour of the World Games Football Team</h3>
<p>- Written and Sent by Li Huitang</p>
<p>Arrive in Calcutta</p>
<p>Our team left Yangon on the British mail ship "Aronda" on the morning of June 30th. The journey day and night made the long-distance sailors in the team feel unhappy. They spent the whole journey with short berths as companions. In this "hurricane season," this route is a bit scary, but it is cheaper for the shipping company, saving a lot of food. On the morning of July 2nd, leaning on the railing and looking down, the sea gradually turned yellow. Asking the people in the boat, they said that it was near the mouth of the "Mirror" River in India. The boat was sailing smoothly, without any shaking. Those who were seasick were also suddenly excited and scrambled into the dining room. At 8:30 AM, we entered the river. The forests and fields on both sides were endless. It is heard that it takes another 60 or 70 nautical miles to reach Calcutta by following this river. Just after lunch, Calcutta was far away in sight. Hundreds of people were waiting on the shore to welcome us, including Chen Liang, a leading overseas Chinese businessman, and the president and staff of the Indian Football Association. They boarded the ship and shook hands with us warmly, asking questions one after another. The enthusiasm was touching. After landing, we took a car around the city for a week before rushing to the "Dahua Hotel" to stay. Calcutta is not only the largest city in India, but also in the Far East. Its vast area and dense population are also second to none. In a moment's impression, although not much was seen, the most profound thing is that there are also three "not smalls" here: not few people, not few cars, and not few cattle. Sometimes the pedestrians on the street are really shoulder to shoulder. There are more than 70,000 vehicles in the city. The bustling downtown area often suffers from traffic congestion. The most surprising thing is that you can often see one or two cows on the main roads, bustling places, and in front of large stores, wandering around, unrestrained. Even if they are blocking traffic, the police and pedestrians do not interfere and let them walk freely. It is said that the Buddhists here do not eat beef and worship it as a god. There are releases every year, so there are traces of cattle everywhere in the city. This can also be regarded as a novel sight.</p>
<p>(July 2nd) Nothing happened in the morning. After lunch, the local overseas Chinese community jointly held a tea party to welcome us, and invited European and Indian people to accompany us. During the meeting, everyone gave speeches, all stating the close relationship between the history, classics, and culture of the two ancient countries of China and India. Finally, Dr. Rong thanked us for our gratitude. At 5:30 PM, we went to watch the Class A cycle match here. This match is related to this year's championship, so it is unparalleled. Before our car arrived at the venue, we could see tens of thousands of people moving around from afar. The stands in the arena were made of wood (because the venue is a military venue, permanent buildings are not allowed), and could not accommodate many spectators. Even if it was crowded, it could only accommodate about 20,000 people. However, the enthusiasm for football here is well-known in the Far East. The spectators on the slopes outside the arena are probably 70,000 or 80,000, people like ants, and like stacked Arhats. The salt situation during the football final of the 6th National Games is still not comparable. Since our team's tour to the south, the spectators in all the places we have visited have broken local records, but the excitement today is unprecedented, which is enough to make us open our tongues and stare at our eyes. What is especially new is that the spectators outside the arena who are in the back row and cannot see the whole picture are all holding wooden frames with small mirrors placed on top, and a mirror is suspended below, slightly inclined upwards. The scene of the competition in the arena is reflected and fully visible on the lower mirror. The mirror holders sit cross-legged, watching the movie on the screen, leisurely and happily, without competing with others. This little gadget is also a new experience. Here, there are often football matches, because the weather is too hot, only 50 minutes (5 and a half minutes less). Indian players mostly fight barefoot, and their agility is like a deer running, which benefits a lot. However, sometimes when they encounter those wearing boots, they also suffer a bit. There are no two advantages in the world, which is even more believed here. The football skills here are mostly at a very high level. Short and long passes are all quite accurate, especially short passes are excellent. However, the shooting skills are still lacking, and the header is not very good. In short, what I observed today is that Indian football is still quite pleasing. Although I can't see any particularly outstanding people, everyone is above average. Our team will meet their elite tomorrow, which is not optimistic.</p>
<p>China-India War</p>
<p>(July 4th) Today is the date of the China-India International Competition. This international contact is actually very important. It is heard that the admission tickets were sold out ten days ago. Speculators have doubled or tripled the value of the tickets for sale, which shows that this game is very attractive. The weather was clear and the sun was high on this day. After lunch, from our hostel, we could see the spectators rushing to the arena in a continuous stream. It was said that there were still five or six hours before the start of the game, and the fans did not care about the hard work because of the superiority of the location, and waited under the hot sun with umbrellas. This is a true first-class fan. At 5:30 PM, our team drove into the arena. The spectators were all over the field, and those who could not get in were countless. The lively situation has set an unprecedented record. After the music was played, our team took the following 11 players and took to the field to fight. The first half was 1 to 0, and the result was 1 to 1. The scorer was Jinshun.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Xu Yahui Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang Tan Jiangbai Li Huitang Sun Jinshun Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>After a little leg training, they lined up in front of the stand and shook hands and saluted a certain Indian prince, the president of the Football Association. After the ceremony, the game started. 19 of the opponents were barefoot, which took advantage of the dry and hard field today. Since we started playing football, we have never encountered opponents who played barefoot. Today, we broke the topic and had a special feeling after contacting them, which was strange and interesting and indescribable. They were good at managing the ball, and the passing and passing were excellent. Xu Yahui in our team had just recovered from illness and had not played for half a month. Today, he took to the field again, but his strength was poor. Rongzhao's position was also poor, and the middle and right sides were repeatedly invaded by the enemy. The performance of the forwards, Jiliang and Jiangbai, was the most abnormal. Jiangbai could not use his header skills, which affected the whole line. In the first half, Jinshun scored a goal and took the lead by one to zero. In the second half, the Indian team's offensive became more intense, and our team was surrounded and in danger many times. Fortunately, they lacked shooting skills and did not lose. Before the end of the game, Shaohan was penalized 12 yards for stealing the ball, so he was tied at 1 to 1. After the game, all parties commented that this free kick was inappropriate. In short, our team did not make any amazing revelations in today's game. The whole team, except for Jiaping, Tiansheng, Zhenhe, and Huitang, who could maintain the usual bear, the rest were far inferior to the measures taken in Yangon the week before. Was it because there were too many spectators and they were afraid of the arena? Was it related to the hot weather?</p>
<p>The Chinese football team lost to the British team by zero to two.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Last Day of August, Market Prices for Public Bonds are Mostly Inverted.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the last day of futures for August. Because the 27th was Confucius' birthday and the market was closed, the market was stopped one day earlier this month. The market was mostly short covering, and there was very limited long covering. Because there were many swap transactions, the market prices rose and fell without a fixed pattern. Although there have been changes in the environment, the market seemed to be temporarily insensitive to the worries due to the chip relationship. Today, only one month of futures for September is traded. Based on the environmental speculation, there should be a slight rebound. The 96 was pulled up several times and finally fell. The opening sentiment yesterday was relatively weak, and the market prices were close to strong and far to weak, and most of them were inverted. In particular, the B bond was inverted by 1 yuan, which was the largest. The market prices were compared to be small, ranging from 12 cents to 40 cents. The secondary market was still dominated by swap transactions. D bond and B bond had a slight long covering trend. D bond No. 72 had a large number of cash deliveries, and the long positions of B bond were too crowded. The other bonds were still slightly short covering, and the market prices were inverted again and again. The afternoon opening was the most popular, and short covering was still the most important. Market prices were mostly good for 10 cents to 30 cents, and most were still inverted. However, the D bond was small for 20 cents this month, and the closing prices of D and B bonds were long covering, with near-term falling and far-term rising. The rest continued to be good for 10 cents to 40 cents. The market price fluctuated indefinitely when the chips were mutually squeezed, which was not the regularity of the market price. As a result, D bond and B bond were small for 35 cents this month, and the rest uniformly rose from 12 cents to 45 cents. The 96 was small for 25 cents. The total transaction volume was 13,585,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed on the left for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Short Covering is Done According to the Market. Chen Cotton Almost Stopped Being Auctioned. The Low Price Once Reached 41 Yuan and 20 Cents. As a Result, it Still Fell by 1 Yuan and 85 Cents.</h3>
<p>Because the settlement of the cotton market in this month's period is imminent, the long positions are based on the abundant cotton production. The Ningbo Xinyao cotton industry has already been coming in continuously. The general short covering can only be painfully cut according to the market, and the market is showing a tragic decline. When the market opened in the afternoon, the low peak reached 41 yuan and 20 cents, which was 3 yuan and 25 cents lower than the previous day, which reached the limit of the board. After the profit takers made up, it rebounded by 1 yuan and 40 cents, and compared to it, it still fell by 1 yuan and 85 cents.</p>
<p>New Cotton also Enters the 9 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>When the market opened in the morning, the price of American cotton in the Southern set fell by 5 to 7 basis points, and Indian cotton was flat. The price of Osaka Sanpin Cotton rose by 11 cents. The market was quite worried. Because the long positions of Chen Cotton in the August period participated in the abundant new cotton production year, there was absolutely no intention to receive Chen Cotton. As a result, the table was panicked, and there was a trend of a thousand-mile crash. The market fell sharply. Shen Ji and Hengyi vigorously increased their stakes, and Xincheng, Dayan, Yuanxingchang, and Jifeng all made up for short positions. As a result, the August period fell by 2 yuan and 35 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. The distant months broke the 9 yuan mark and fell by 4.5 to 5.7 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month fell by another 90 cents. However, when the auction reached the near month, profit takers made a large number of offsets and were firm, and the distant months returned to outside the 9 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the sellers came like a tidal surge at the close, and the price fell sharply by 30 cents. As a result, each month rebounded by 5 cents to 20 cents compared to the morning closing price. Dafeng and Xincheng bought in the morning and Dou Chadu out in the afternoon. Shen Ji bought 6,800 piculs, Changfeng 9,500 piculs, Gengfeng 4,500 piculs, Xingchang 2,400 piculs, Hexing 2,000 piculs, Runkang 2,100 piculs, Juxing 4,600 piculs, Hengyi 3,200 piculs, Tongji 2,400 piculs, Yongyu 4,000 piculs, Deda 2,200 piculs. Yuanxingchang bought in 7,300 piculs, Yuanyi 2,000 piculs, Tonghe 3,300 piculs, Fukang 2,200 piculs, Dachang 3,900 piculs, Yichang 2,500 piculs, Yuda 3,000 piculs, Jifeng 4,000 piculs, Mingde 4,000 piculs, and Xinchang 2,000 piculs. The highest and lowest prices in one day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Statistics, Shanghai Commodity Price Index for July of the 25th Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>Living Expenses Index: 111.1, an increase of 0.4% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 6.7% compared to the same month last year. Comparing the five categories of indices with the previous month, except for rent and miscellaneous items which remained unchanged, food, clothing, and fuel all increased slightly. The food category index increased by 0.5%. Although there were more items that decreased in price than increased, the prices of staple foods such as white rice, soybean oil, and fresh fish all rose slightly, and the price of vegetables in the market also increased sharply, so the index for this category still rose slightly. The clothing category index rose by 1.3%, with fine cloth rising slightly and cotton drill increasing slightly. The fuel index only increased by 0.2%.</p>
<p>The comparison of the monthly indices for each category with the previous month and the same month last year is listed below (taking the year of the Republic of China 15 as 100%).</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Fall Daily, Yarn Market Also Reports Tragic Decline, This Month to $195.60</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell in the morning, recovered slightly in the afternoon, but ultimately continued to decline. This was mainly because the August contract only has one more business day tomorrow. Many parties, seeing the daily decline in cotton prices and the easing of cotton yarn costs, were unwilling to take delivery. Floating positions were mostly settled based on the new market, and the decline was remarkably strong. The forward contracts were dragged into the whirlpool, with all months breaking through the $200 mark.</p>
<p>Forward Contracts Have Broken Through $200</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Market Opening: Because the August yarn contract only has tomorrow left for trading, most floating positions, seeing the abundant cotton harvest and expecting cotton prices to fall, were unwilling to take delivery of cotton yarn. As a result, the market became increasingly weak, with all months declining in a straight line. At the same time, spot yarn business stagnated, and people were even more discouraged. Market prices fell step by step, with each month breaking through the $200 mark. Dafu, Xuan Yi, and Shen Ji were all actively selling, while Feng Nuli also put out large volumes. Dachang, Xingchang, Senkangde, and Da Linjin were also considerable. As a result, each month fell by $2.40 to $1.60 compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon trading session, the current month remained weak, with bids reaching as far as the distant months. After the trading session, it was said that the Sichuan brokers still had some transactions. Short sellers pushed forward, and the last three months rose back outside the $200 mark. Unexpectedly, all months closed lower, and the decline intensified. As a result, each month rose by $1.40 to $1.60 compared to the morning closing price. Market transactions were frequent. The morning session closed at 1:15, and the afternoon session was extended, opening at 3:00 and closing after 6:00, which shows how enthusiastic speculators must be. According to reports, Dafu bought in the afternoon after selling in the morning, Tongji 3,000 bales, Hengyi 6,200 bales, Juyu 5,150 bales, Shenji 2,450 bales, Renyi 1,150 bales, Dachangcheng 1,250 bales, Changfeng 3,650 bales, Jinghua 1,250 bales, Daji 3,650 bales, and Xiacheng 1,700 bales. Shengji bought in 5,450 bales, Xingchang 3,550 bales, Senkang 1,850 bales, Dachang 3,800 bales, Shengyuan 1,050 bales, and Taichang 1,800 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Falls by $1-$2</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were average. According to a survey, various brokers purchased a total of 927 bales throughout the day, with selling prices falling by $1.20 or more. The purchase amounts for each broker are listed below:</p>
<p>Sichuan: 200 Shantou: 10 Inland: 255</p>
<p>Guangdong: 170 Jiangxi: 20 Changsha: 250</p>
<p>Hankou: 5 Peers: 17</p>
<h3>Slight Rise in Third-Grade Yarn</h3>
<p>Osaka Telegraph, 24th: Third-grade futures yarn rose by 50 cents to $1.30, with the near month at $209.50 and the distant month at $209. Futures cotton rose by 5 cents to 25 cents, with the near month at $64.70 and the distant month at $62.25.</p>
<h3>Grain: Spot Sales Quiet, Bulls Emerge in This Month's Flour, a Significant Drop of More Than 5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market returned to normal. After the opening in the morning, foreign wheat (Chicago) was slightly higher by a small amount for the near month, and better by several points for the distant months. Canadian wheat rose by about 10 cents. There was no foreign guidance to follow. The spot wheat market was already sluggish, and flour sales were also quiet. Moreover, trading for this month is about to end, leaving little room for maneuver. Large and small bulls emerged one after another. New short positions for distant months arose upon hearing the news. Therefore, the market fell step by step from the opening, continuing the downward trend. By the afternoon closing, the domestic factories slightly increased their intake of distant contracts, and the momentum finally stabilized. As a result, compared to the weekend closing, this month fell by 5.25 cents, September and November each fell by a small 4 cents, October fell by a small 3.75 cents, December fell by a small 2.1 cents, and January fell by a small 2.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Spot Merchants Rush to Hedge Sell, Futures Wheat Drops Step by Step, October Falls by a Whole Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw spot factories become less enthusiastic, and the depreciation of medium-grade wheat was particularly severe. The delivery period for this month is approaching rapidly. In general, merchants, seeing that the delivered goods from the new harvest are all medium-quality, have become less interested in taking delivery. Therefore, after the opening in the morning, bulls sold off one after another, and spot merchants also began to hedge sell in succession. As a result, the situation in the morning declined step by step, with near and distant months falling by 6 to 9 cents. However, foreign wheat reports were still calm, but the downward trend was already quite weak. In the afternoon, floating short positions covered, and opportunistic traders entered the market, gradually stabilizing the situation. Therefore, the afternoon only fluctuated between 1 and 2 cents, resulting in a situation where the market started with a decline and ended with stabilization. Overall, compared to last Saturday's closing price, August fell by a small 4 cents, October fell by a dime, November fell by a small 9 cents, and September and December each fell by a small 8 cents. Spot wheat, due to sluggish sales at factories, had slightly relaxed receiving standards, and prices were considering tightening slightly. However, hawkers were unwilling to lower prices, so a stalemate temporarily formed. No bales were delivered throughout the day.</p>
<h3>New Sesame from Yangzhou Enters the Market, New Soybeans Become Popular Due to Rumors of Japanese Merchants Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 200 packages of new sesame from Yangzhou arrived. Because the goods were low-grade, the local market selected 71 packages, with a price opening at $9.40. This year's product is significantly inferior to last year's, with a quality of only 834. This is largely due to excessive rainfall, which affected the color. The yield cannot yet be accurately measured, but it is estimated to be about 60-70%. Large batches of new goods from the Jinpu Railway are expected to arrive around the Mid-Autumn Festival. Transactions involving foreign firms dumping new sesame were seen as restrained yesterday. Both buyers and sellers adopted a defensive posture at a price of $13, so no transactions occurred. Due to widespread rumors of Japanese merchants buying in Jiujiang, new soybeans became sought after in the local market. The market's sentiment was disrupted. Oil mills lowered prices to purchase, so the market price suddenly rose by more than 20 cents. More than 2,000 packages of Jiangqiao soybeans were transacted. The local market sold more than 1,400 packages of Changzhou buffalo hide yellow beans and more than 200 packages of Eryang soybeans, as well as Zhuxi soybeans. Chen soybeans were taken by the Jianshe office to the Siping Street bean cake factory. The market price rose by 16-17 cents compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Prices Were Flat and Weak, Customer Xian Rice Had Strong Sales</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various brokers arrived with a total of ten points and seven numbers, totaling more than 3,000 dan. Customer sales remained poor. Baowei Qingniao Brokers also purchased 400-500 packages. Therefore, the market situation was high, stable, and weak. Except for high-quality goods, the market prices for thick early japonica and thin indica were unaffected. Medium and low qualities all fell by a few points. Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan were both still stable. Dongxin arrived with more than 1,000 dan, but the outflow decreased, and prices fell by a dime.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34-35 ships arrived from various routes in Hexia. Among the goods on the market, white japonica sales were slightly active, Bianyuan was still good, and the remaining goods were all sluggish. The white japonica market price fell by about a dime. The prices for various indica and thin indica were flat and weak. Bianyuan also showed a soft trend. The price of Dongxin japonica fell by a small dime. The new japonica from Zhuanqiao that opened on the market yesterday was from the Dongxin route. The opening price was slightly higher, which was due to the difference between the good and bad qualities of the Hexia factories.</p>
<p>(Customer Xian) The arrival of Customer Xian rice was very strong yesterday and the day before, especially with more goods arriving from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. A total of more than 30,000 packages arrived newly in two days, and the number of Hankou arriving in the yarn market accounted for two-thirds. Although customer sales have been strong in recent days, the large number of new rice arrivals has ultimately put downward pressure on market prices, ranging from a few points to a dime. Yesterday, our Customer rice sales were all active. The Beiyang Brokers purchased 2,500 packages of Xiangjing, and the Cantonese Brokers purchased 6,000-7,000 packages of rough rice. The others were all purchased by the local market, with limited purchases by scattered brokers. Because new rice is being launched successively in various places, inland brokers have lacked appetite. A total of 2,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 3,900 packages of Hunan rice, 600 packages of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, and more than 8,000 packages of Ying rough rice were offered throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth: Only Printed Fabrics Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was affected by the estimated increase in domestic cotton production and the uniform weakness of foreign cotton and standard yarn, and the market trended downward. White goods bore the brunt. Each brand of Japanese factory goods, including fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, coarse twill, market cloth, and 84 gray cloth, all fell in price one after another, falling from 5 cents to a dime per bolt. The sales prices of coarse twill and coarse cloth from local factories remained stable, while fine cloth and fine twill slightly recovered by 5 cents per bolt. However, the demand for printed and plain tribute cloth, serge, satin, and printed flannel from various Chinese and foreign factories remained strong, and the sales prices were stable. Customers from the Northwest Shaanxi Province gradually increased their orders. Although the weather is arid, the impact on cotton production is still minimal. Printed fabrics in Sichuan, Hunan, and Yunnan are also still active, causing all factories' production to fall short of delivery. Guangdong and Guangxi have seen a sharp decline in sales due to the current situation. Brokers from the North, including Tianjin and Jinan, are still purchasing large quantities of line cloth, coarse cloth, printed tribute cloth, and serge. Inland brokers have gradually increased their purchases of light-weight coarse cloth, local factory fine twill, colored line cloth, printed tribute cloth, and serge.</p>
<h3>Western Tribute Cloth is Searched for Eagerly</h3>
<p>Ordinary Yuanqing tribute cloth has been in great demand from the Changsha and Chongqing brokers, and the stock inside and outside the Shanghai market is severely depleted. Both domestic and foreign goods have risen in price across the board. In particular, Western goods priced at $5.00 are particularly popular. Most merchants have already searched and exhausted their stocks. Because no new goods have been imported, Japanese goods priced at $5.59 must be sold for about $5.00, causing customers to universally need to purchase Western goods. Yesterday, ordinary Yuan tribute cloths from Shunquan, Longtai, Shishi, Shaoshi, and Deji Six Filial Garden and Lihe Naotiangong, etc., priced around $5.00, were all sold out. Their popularity is comparable to Polish woolen cloth. Yesterday, Guohuo Zhanghua Yuan tribute cloth sold for $4.50, Sima Xiangru from Abe, Ichito, and Mitsui sold for $4.95, Anli Jubaopen $7.70, and Gongyi Jinshita $6.60.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Markets Feel Very Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market in the New York silk market. Yokohama spot prices maintained their original prices, and the futures trend was loose and weak. The price of silk in Lyon did not move. The atmosphere in foreign markets was very depressed. Domestic users also lacked vitality. Yesterday, only white-head merchants had some transactions. In addition, transactions with white factories and Shandong brokers were also very quiet.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui Bulk Transactions Were Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market situation was slightly more active. Brokers from England, America, France, and other countries had sales of green tea from various routes. Among them, the bulk category of Pingshui was the most active, with more than 8,600 boxes transacted. The top price was $41.75, which was still considered stable. As for Luzhuang, Tuzhuang, Zhenmei, and Zhucha, the market also improved compared to before. However, the selling price of Zhenmei tended to be soft, and the Zhucha market price was solid. The situation remained inconsistent between firmness and softness.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Merchants Association report, yesterday there were continued sporadic transactions of green tea. Xiehe purchased more than 200 boxes of Zhenmei, estimated at $104 for the four famous brands, and $71 for the Tunzhen brand. Baolong purchased more than 200 boxes of Huizhen, priced at $58 to $60. Fushi and Hua tea each purchased more than 100 boxes, priced at $60 to $70. Yongxing also purchased a small amount of each. Xiehe also purchased another 600 boxes of Xiaozhenmei, priced at $25 to $28. In addition, since the founding of the Xiezhuhui Yuan Tea Market, there have been one or two transactions of Gongxi. Yesterday, there were 32 more boxes, with a transaction price of $100. Tongfu purchased more than 400 boxes of Pingshui another colored Zhucha, priced at $57. Bulk transactions were relatively quiet.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures Dongbai Prices Loosened - Reaching a Total of Weakly 50,000 Packages in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened as the underground trading of Dongbai futures in recent days offered more than 40,000 packages at lower prices. Yesterday, the Lifang factory continued to offer 4,000 packages, estimated at (J) $6.15, (N) $5.95, and SH $5.75. Therefore, the Public Association's market assessment was also weak. Second and fourth grade rough white sugar was transacted at $6.65. Dongbai No. 4 was transacted at $21.30, re-exported at $6.30, and No. 8 spot was transacted at $21.13, re-exported at $6.10, all down by a small amount. No. 9 called for the original price. Yesterday, the Jinxin Dahua local factory's Mianbai No. 1 goods were transported to Lianyungang by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Taishun wheel with more than 2,000 packages. In addition, there were several hundred packages of Hainan red. A broker on the Foreign Firm Street offered more than 1,000 packages of Hainan red, priced at $12.50 to $12.60, which were then purchased in full by the Tianjin brokers. Although the price fell back, the market trend was still popular. In addition, the Chaozhou brokers offered more than 80 packages of Qingshi red, priced at $15.40, which was slightly looser than before. 17,500 packages of Dutch rough white sugar were transported by the Zhi Geni Canada wheel yesterday.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its first tender for Cantonese rough white sugar of the week yesterday, with a total quota of more than 6,000 packages. The tender price was as before. The Shunde factory's Wuyang white was sold for 395 packages at $21.60, the Shixin factory sold another 140 packages at $21.40, and the Shizhong white sand sold 20 packages at $19.30, for a total of 555 packages transacted.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Lanzhu Branch Prices Tighten, Hainan Longan Arrives in Large Quantities, Price Falls</h3>
<p>Hainan Longan: Yesterday, two ships arrived from Sichuan and Shandong, and the arrival of goods gradually increased. In addition, the price of Guangzhou Longan has been falling for days, and sentiment is trending downward. The market price has become depressed. Goods previously priced at $5.30 were offered yesterday, falling by a dime, breaking through the $50 mark. Therefore, it is expected that today's market offering will be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>Lanzhu Branch: Recently, due to the lack of arrival and inventory, the market offering has tightened, reaching $30, which is a dime higher than the first market. It is said that Taiyuan was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it has not arrived by evening. It is likely that the delay was caused by a storm en route. It is said that the number of arrivals this time will definitely increase, and the owners' intentions are quite high, and they have sent telegrams requesting an increase in price, demanding to hold at $35.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Dongbai Iron is Dumped in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Zhongshan and Asia factories (Japanese companies) in the local area for Dongbai iron, the output has reached about 10,000 sheets per day. The local factory's construction brokers' sales market only sells about 4,000 sheets per day. Therefore, the agents and distributors have tried their best to promote it to the inland rivers and the Yangtze River, but the average daily sales volume is only 3,000 sheets. It is passed that Japanese businessmen are paying attention to the Sichuan brokers' business, so the market price for Sichuan brokers' sales is also particularly low, by about 2 cents per sheet. Therefore, large amounts of sales are being shipped to Sichuan every day, with 7,000-8,000 sheets being shipped. The market price is about $1 per seven-foot sheet, and about 81-82 cents per six-foot sheet. The agents and distributors can deduct a commission of 2-3 cents per sheet. Therefore, the sales of British-Bidd and other goods have been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Women and Night</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Women and night seem to be inseparable. A night without women to embellish it is lonely and chilling. And women who are not active at night also seem unable to express the mystery of women.</p>
<p>Naturally, in the early morning, in the daytime, there are also many women active in our society. But those women are either female workers, women... There are also various other women who exchange labor for life. But when the night falls, covering the earth, the wails of life are covered by an atmosphere of joy. In the realm of night, all there is are women and laughter, or laughing women.</p>
<p>The bowstring vibrates on the erhu string. Sharp and clear voices, accompanied by the erhu sound, come from large restaurants, large hotels, and so-called residences that look like mansions. Then, there is a burst of hearty laughter. Awkwardly, it is the laughter of men. Sharply, it is the laughter of women. Under the ghostly lights, in the splendid melodies, laughing men, embracing laughing women, stepping at a light pace, are so leisurely. In the playground, men are constantly winking at women, and women are also constantly flirting with men. There, all women are so mysterious. In massage parlors, there are even more young and beautiful girls. There are also women who perform obscene and immoral acts, doing incredible work to win the laughter of men. The most common are naturally the goddesses standing on the street. Under the dim lights, they radiate a mysterious allure with unnatural smiles.</p>
<p>Why do women have to be active at night? I think, perhaps they can hide under the lights, hidden under the powder and rouge, the traces of the lashings of life? But our night, in reality, is fortunately filled with women, which is why it is so mysterious. Otherwise, our society would really be too lonely!</p>
<h3>Night at the Jai Alai Court</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Multicoloured neon lights illuminate a horizontal English sign reading "auditorium". The entrances and exits are crowded with gentlemanly tycoons, well-dressed young men, strangely dressed and flamboyantly attired young ladies, slick-haired hooligans... The Indian doorman keeps shouting, "Pass! Pass!" Then a large group of people are swallowed in, and then another large group of people are spat out.</p>
<p>The magnificent architecture, the bright electric lights, make people forget the night. Luxury, extravagance, the lights seem to be a place of production, but also a place to wear away national aspirations. However, in order to satisfy certain desires, people ignore their own survival and flock to it in droves!</p>
<p>After the people are seated, several players walk into the large wire mesh cage, wearing red, yellow, and green sports uniforms. First, a man in a suit blows a whistle, which is considered a simple opening ceremony, and the players begin the game. A wooden ball, like a duck egg, jumps back and forth, strangely orderly. One can't help but admire the superb sporting techniques of the Europeans and Americans! After one round is completed, the number cards under the players' surnames hanging high up change with the victories and defeats. Then the audience begins to stir. The banknotes at the ticket office fly like butterflies. Two dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars, thirty dollars... People seem to have gone mad, forgetting the money earned with blood and sweat, forgetting everything, even forgetting themselves.</p>
<p>"Hiss... hiss... hiss..." A command announces the end of one game. People's hearts are beating anxiously, but when they realize their disappointment, they are extremely resentful. There are also those who are laughing and happy, but they are ultimately in the minority!</p>
<p>Soon the second game begins, and the audience goes even crazier! Because "failure is the mother of success". They firmly believe in this famous saying! Listen to the sound of madness!</p>
<p>"Hey! Come on, one Caleja, two Chremadi!"</p>
<p>"Come on, two Bilbaos, two Yisgaos!"</p>
<p>But the result is Yahampei. They keep repeating this, muttering "bad luck", going on and on, twelve o'clock, one o'clock... But their spirit is even more invigorated and interested than when they are working. If there were no clock in the world, I believe they would definitely think that there is no distinction between day and night.</p>
<p>According to someone familiar with this way of life, the income here every night is at least around five or six thousand dollars, and half of it is contributed by our Chinese people. Although some people say: "China is extremely poor."</p>
<h3>Night at the Confucian Temple Park</h3>
<p>— Yao Mingran</p>
<p>When the scorching sun has collected its flames, and the night breeze is sending coolness: it is the Confucian Temple at night, the most lively moment. The stream-like crowds flow, making the usually quiet Confucian Temple Road as bustling as Nanjing Road!</p>
<p>The guard at the gate cannot control this large force of people. Entering the gate, you feel the heat rising, looking around, all are filled with black crowds, some sitting, some standing, some dozing off! Some chatting and talking! Dachengmen is the key fortress of cool breeze, attracting crowds who are greedy for coolness, like plainclothes teams, taking encircling skirmish lines to consolidate their positions!</p>
<p>Pushing through the crowd like a scout, it is finally difficult to reach the front of the steps of the Dacheng Hall. Although there are a few swaying trees trying to drive away the hot air for us, how can they resist it completely? There, tea shopkeepers, the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat surround the steps, just like a screen!</p>
<p>The road is getting harder and harder to walk! Sneakily and slowly walking to the city library side, the wild lotus leaves in the pond in front of the library are quietly standing tall and graceful. A few clear calls of the gold-threaded frogs are enough for the crowd suffocated by the hot gods to breathe! Because of the clear and melodious sound, it also attracts a lot of crowds. In the middle, one person suffering from Hysteria-like disease raised his head and laughed, attracting sidelong glances from others. Dozens of gazes focused on his face, scanning him until he was embarrassed and turned to sneak away! Further down, it is the business department of Guanshengyuan. The brilliant lights illuminate the entire room, and the rotating electric fans are busy non-stop. The moon hangs high, the bright and clean stars, bathing in the river, reflecting snowy silver light. At the same time, the fireflies on the water's edge, flashing and sparkling, embellish the Confucian Temple on a summer night!</p>
<p>It is nine o'clock, and the bell urging you to return home is loudly warning you, saying goodbye to the Confucian Temple at night. The fluorescent lights and the sound of frogs are swirling in my mind, becoming my spiritual companions on my way home.</p>
<h3>Night at Bansong Garden</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Bansong Garden at the South Railway Station, in the recent three years, has been opening its night garden every summer. This year's night garden has already opened. In addition to the usual various embellishments, Ding Wan'e has been specially invited to sing Shanghai opera in the Four Sides Hall. Open-air movies are shown in the open space. On Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, there are also fireworks displays.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday night. Out of curiosity, I went to Bansong Garden to experience the night scenery of this garden. When I arrived at Niusong Garden, it was about seven o'clock in the evening. Yunfei cars and Xiangsheng cars carried park visitors one after another and dropped them off at the entrance of Bansong Garden. Inside Bansong Garden, the lights were all lit up at this time, turning into a night scene.</p>
<p>As I walked into the garden, passing through the winding mud road, I saw electric lights installed everywhere among the green trees, reflecting a kind of green light, making the garden feel even more secluded. Those summer cicadas hiding under the leaves, thinking that the lights were sunlight, mistakenly recognizing night as day, were happily singing in the wind again.</p>
<p>Temporarily pleased, I climbed to the highest earthen mound and sat in the thatched pavilion. Looking around, it was all dark, I could see nothing, only occasionally could I catch a glimpse of a star or two of light through the branches. A cool breeze blew in gusts, landing on my body, making me feel cool all over, forgetting the scorching heat I felt when I sat at home during the day.</p>
<p>Inside the pond, I remember that last year there was a Three Pools Mirroring the Moon protruding in front of the lake heart pavilion, but this year, opposite the lake heart pavilion, a Jiaxing misty rain building was built. Electric lights along the lake were reflected in the water, which would immediately make you think of the night scenery on the shore of West Lake. Rowboats floated gently on the water, and the tourists sang songs in the darkness when they were happy.</p>
<p>Here, loving men and women whispered sweet nothings in the winding paths, and noble gentlemen led their wives, children, and daughters-in-law to leisurely tour the night garden. Male and female workers also came to this garden to breathe and recover from the fatigue of their daytime work. There were indeed many visitors in the garden!</p>
<p>It is said that the fireworks will not be set off until 11:30. I circled around the garden alone several times and really could not wait. I had no choice but to sacrifice not watching them. When I walked out, I found the game of Wenhu in Jiangshang Caotang, and the lotus flowers in the lotus pond had bloomed. A pool of lotus leaves was so fat that it was hard to see. After leaving the park gate, I went back the same way.</p>
<h3>Changing Nests and Mating Birds</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Brocade Happiness Repeated, Sounds Resonate on Emerald Leaves; Bridal Gown Startlingly Tried On, Tears Wet the Silk Gauze</p>
<p>He walked to the washstand, reaching into the basin to wash his face, only to realize he was still holding the teacup. So, he put down the teacup and laughed heartily to himself. Aunt Liu hurried into the room, asking what was the matter. He had already hastily washed up, not even drinking his tea, and tucked away the letter and painting, hurrying out. Originally, he hoped to see Menglan on the road, thank her, and perhaps have a chance to speak with her. But his plan was misguided. On this day, Menglan felt the impending doom, disheartened and uninterested in anything, let alone focused on reading. At this moment, after getting out of bed, she was sitting at her desk by the window, staring blankly at the two tall willow trees next door. Xiao Ju stood at the doorway, repeatedly knocking. Menglan turned her head and saw her holding a cloth bundle, hands raised above her head, smiling, "Miss, try on the new clothes that have arrived." Menglan stood up, took the bundle, feeling it was quite thick and heavy. She said, "Wasn't I only having a lined jacket made of green satin? Why is there so much?" Xiao Ju smiled, "The clothes inside are beautiful." Menglan, feeling somewhat puzzled, placed the bundle on the bed, opened it, and the first thing that caught her eye was a bright red color. It was a lined jacket of light red silk, trimmed with large red satin. Without looking at the folded clothes below, she knew there was a light red silk skirt. She frowned at Xiao Ju and said, "Who told you to bring this? Are these my clothes?" Seeing her slightly widened eyes and rosy cheeks, Xiao Ju put a finger in her mouth, took a few steps back, and lowered her head, unable to lift it. Menglan pointed to the bundle, "This is heavy. You brought it, you have to take it away. If you don't, I'll hit you." Seeing the situation was bad, Xiao Ju turned and ran downstairs. Menglan didn't dare look at the bundle on the bed, picked up a book, placed it on the table, and looked at it intentionally or unintentionally. But she heard leisurely footsteps approaching from behind. She guessed it was Xiao Ju again; this child liked to meddle, and the more you paid attention to her, the more she would cause trouble. She fixed her eyes on the book, ignoring everything else. At this moment, a hand quietly rested on her shoulder. She shrugged, saying, "I'm not in a good mood, don't bother me." As she turned her head, she saw her mother standing by the chair with a slight smile. Menglan immediately stood up and said, "Mother, you've come to my room too." Madam Jiang smiled, "You're being childish again. I asked Xiao Ju to bring the bundle upstairs. If you want to blame someone, blame me." Menglan said, "I...you're not...I don't like..."</p>
<h3>A Poem on Twenty-Four Gentlemen</h3>
<p>— (Sun Shouchang)</p>
<p>On this year's Lantern Festival, Mayor Wu invited He Wuliang, Gu Bangjun, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xingyan, Wang Boyuan, Jiang Yiping, Wu Xingya, Li Dachao, Chen Jicheng, Chu Minyi, Zhu Wenqi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Yushu, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Mei Lanfang, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xiaochu, Gu Shaochuan, Sun Daosheng, Xu Jiji, Lu Shoulian, Chen Xiaodie, and others to a spring banquet at the International Hotel, where the Datong Music Society played "White Snow in the Sunny Spring," a grand occasion of the time. Yesterday, I received a seven-character ancient verse from Chen Xiaodie from Japan, asking me to compose a matching poem, incorporating the names of the above gentlemen, which is not easy to do. I transcribe it below:</p>
<p>The round moon shines on He "Wuliang" in the fifteenth,</p>
<p>Where gentlemen like "Bangjun" gather for a spring cleanse.</p>
<p>Cups float on the winding stream of "Xinzhi",</p>
<p>"Xingyan" sets the rules upon the banquet.</p>
<p>The wine god "Boyuan" is full of vigor,</p>
<p>Absorbing all the spring red as smooth as a whetstone.</p>
<p>"Yiping" enjoys a carefree life in this time,</p>
<p>Awakening "Xingya" from a dream, the European wind blows.</p>
<p>The heaven and earth are as expansive as "Dachao's" eight diagrams,</p>
<p>Stars are scattered, resembling "Jicheng's" assembled heroes.</p>
<p>"Minyi" should not be haggard,</p>
<p>Temporarily finding solace in the lonely tung tree.</p>
<p>Spring wind tailors the embroidered gauze for "Wenqi",</p>
<p>Rippling "Yuesheng's" delicate flower shadows.</p>
<p>Suddenly rising from the ground with a majestic appearance,</p>
<p>A fierce tiger "Xiaolin" emerges from its lair.</p>
<p>The red clouds are dense, and "Tiesheng" is not open,</p>
<p>A righteous man willingly dies for his country.</p>
<p>Ape Duke reads the green jade book,</p>
<p>Sitting and "Yansong" contemplating the clear moon.</p>
<p>Ten thousand apertures blow, and "Xiaolai's" sounds increase,</p>
<p>"Lanfang's" carriage returns with exceptional aura.</p>
<p>Xi He strikes the sun, and "Guangfu" emerges,</p>
<p>The overflowing peach blossoms form a "Xiaochu" knot.</p>
<p>The cloud and water are vast, the road five thousand,</p>
<p>The red forest leaves bear "Shaochuan's" white aura.</p>
<p>Knowing that the ancient "Daosheng" is now,</p>
<p>The ten-day week passes in "Jiji's" every moment.</p>
<p>Who can ascend with "Shoulian" to heaven and earth,</p>
<p>And jointly drink and listen to "Sunny Spring's" "White Snow"?</p>
<h3>Night on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>— Dawn</p>
<p>The night on Avenue Edward VII is built upon the city's erotic culture.</p>
<p>Under the neon lights, the large clock of the "Red Seal Tobacco Company" has not yet passed 12. Here, there are thousands upon thousands of people bustling about. Around the Great World amusement center, the shadows of nightingales and the sounds of music linger, spreading with the flowing air.</p>
<p>On the stretch of road from East Xinjiao Bridge to the Great World, women stroll or walk. On their rough skin, they apply white lead powder. Most of them are those who sell their bodies. Under the social structure of erotic culture, the middle class and proletariat alike are idols of flesh.</p>
<p>Like the lingering nightingales, prostitutes, Shangbai girls, glass girls, and Russian wives, they struggle under the whip of life, similarly creating many deformed people under erotic culture. When night falls, these skeletons dance on this long Avenue Edward VII, as the neon lights redden half the sky.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Rue Zhu Bao San, many neon lights of "BARs" or "CAFEs" flicker. In the hazy night, there are foreign sailors wearing white sailor hats and baggy pants, or French sailors wearing red caps, all wanderers on the Huangpu River or in the colonies. They sway like drunken men, humming vagabond songs.</p>
<p>Fat arms and fat thighs of White Russian aristocratic women, slender figures, and oily black hair of Chinese misses, exuding strong musk in the white powder, scatter throughout this night on Avenue Edward VII. Listening to the jazz music, facing this array of fragrances, they shake the hearts of many wanderers!</p>
<p>The night on Avenue Edward VII is built upon the city's erotic culture.</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Night on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The beautiful night on Avenue Joffre is like a beautiful prose poem, like a French salon painting, even more like a mysterious dream. Here, I believe that if there were a romantic poet, or a sensual essayist, or even a symbolist artist living here, then there would definitely be a great successful work for us to appreciate.</p>
<p>The autumn night on Avenue Joffre has the tranquility of a virgin, the tenderness of a young woman, the abandon of a prostitute, and the sentimentality of a wanderer. Especially just after dusk, strolling with a few friends, looking at a row of distant, flickering streetlights, seemingly a long string of pearls. If one were to look from one end of Avenue Joffre to the other, the dazzling strip of light in the middle would have such a seductive meaning. It would even make one suspect that they were in Paris and forget that they were still in their homeland!</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre is full of French flavor. We only need to see the neatness of the streets, the style of the shops, and the displays in the windows to rarely find any Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>Among the many roads in Shanghai, Avenue Joffre, like North Sichuan Road, has a mysterious color. This road, full of exotic atmosphere, is as straight as a riding whip, from Ba Xianqiao to Avenue des Soeurs, this long stretch of road is as wide and flat as a still river, perfectly straight without a single curve. French plane trees are planted on both sides of the sidewalk, arranged like troops waiting to be inspected, a solemn and orderly air that makes people excited.</p>
<p>Many bizarre and romantic stories often occur in those Russian restaurants and taverns. Every time it is late at night and quiet, when general shops and companies are closed, the Russian restaurants and taverns are just beginning to be lively.</p>
<p>The French Concession is a place of refuge for most White Russians. The men wander the streets all year round, while the women, in addition to selling their bodies to make a living, also work as maids to get by. Although they also have a motherland, their motherland has forgotten them. Although they also have a home, they can no longer return to their own homes. They can only flee to foreign lands, spending a miserable and wandering life forever. Therefore, in this lonely midnight, they can only bring a cavity of hidden resentment, a cavity of depression and boredom, make an appointment with a few companions, and go to the Russian restaurants or taverns to drink inferior beer, get drunk, and stumble out. Some sit alone in a dark corner, silently drinking coffee, recalling the glorious history of the Tsarist era, their past glory, and their current decline. The memory of this story gives him eternal sorrow. They hate the Bolsheviks, but all of this has become a past dream, and now hating and now reminiscing are also in vain.</p>
<p>They also joke with the waitresses, and sometimes when they are drunk, they think of the past situation and cry bitterly. This romantic tragedy is the expression of their inner sadness.</p>
<p>In some cafes, in this quiet night, a melodious, Pizhena voice gently flows out, flowing out, drifting in the streets, drifting on the leaves of the French plane trees. In the charming singing of the young girls, some optimistic European men and women leisurely sit, drinking sweet wine and singing love songs.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre sometimes gives people many stimuli, but sometimes it also gives people much comfort!</p>

<h3>On the Pessimistic Views of Our Medical Community Regarding the National Elections</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, the people of the whole country have focused on various points in the election law that are related to their own positions. Among them, some cannot understand it, some suspect injustice, and some feel obstructed. The affairs of the general office are many, and the brains of the Law Interpretation Committee are particularly taxed. But in the final analysis, things are never fair in this world. It is common sense to cry out when there is injustice. Therefore, there is a lot of noise and many arguments. Our medical community is, of course, unable to escape this door of right and wrong. So recently, there are those who wave flags and shout, those who draw swords and cross bows, those who slam the table and roar, and those who sigh. But whether they are active or passive, they are still nothing more than men of passion and husbands who care about national affairs. Compared with those who are silent and indifferent, they are better in the end. I can now write down several reasons for the pessimistic views of people and publish them to the country and offer them to my colleagues. Let everyone see the benevolent and the wise, and each follow their own conscience.</p>
<p>(Theory A) The fundamental reason why freelancers are not included in citizens but are specially singled out is that they have a kind of specialized knowledge that is outstanding. The country especially respects their profession and highly regards their personality, which has the meaning of looking at them with different eyes. For example, like lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, pharmacists, journalists, educational groups, university teachers, and those who are self-taught, there are a few. Those who call themselves schools and colleges have not been recognized by the Ministry of Education of the government, nor have they been included in the education system by the government. And this kind of background figures are exactly the same as the masons and carpenters of the engineer class, the account-keeping old gentlemen of the accountant class, the court scribes and malicious officials of the lawyer class, the morning paper sellers of the journalist class, the pharmacy workers of the pharmacist class, and the rural school teachers of the educational group university professors. Saying that they can be included in the same category as qualified, knowledgeable, and scientifically knowledgeable doctors and let them compete in the election can really be said to be their bad luck. It is better to be clean than to lower one's own personality and collude with them to make trouble. Therefore, they advocate giving up the right to vote and not voting.</p>
<p>(Theory B) Traditional Chinese medicine does not have a legitimate organization because we already have a medical association in various places. It has been established for many years. According to the organization law of the same industry association, there must not be a second trade association of the same nature within the same region. Therefore, we believe that the National Medicine Association organized by traditional Chinese medicine is an illegitimate organization. That is, the second trade association of the same nature within the same region. Then how can they have the right to recommend? Suppose that the local competent authority recognizes their organization and allows them to register. We can say that it must be recognized that their organization is not the same nature as our medical association. That is the easiest to understand the facts. But why are they inserted into our medical and pharmaceutical associations in this election? According to this method of messing around, we only have one way to give up the right to vote.</p>
<p>(Theory C) Regardless of what our Premier Sun once said, science can save the country. Even if we forget this testament, we should also understand the world situation and advocate attacking from the scientific side to find a way out. But now there is a group of people in the country who insist on raising the metaphysical traditional Chinese medicine to eight feet high. Even in this election, some people are playing tricks in it, wanting to monopolize it with one hand. In terms of traditional Chinese medicine, they do not care about the qualifications, only relying on the fact that there are many people who think that a show of hands can make our science humiliated. Bah, whether or not to represent, there is nothing rare. This kind of behavior is despicable, dirty, and unscrupulous. It is really hateful. We now urgently hope that the people in charge will express a true attitude, and do not need to be ambiguous and afraid of both sides. Suppose it is to promote scientific medicine and to enrich the country and strengthen it. Then the metaphysical medicine that is out of date should be abolished. Otherwise, there is no need to open any foreign-style medical schools or build any foreign-style hospitals. The foreign-style medicine in the army and on the market is even more unnecessary. But this election must take care of both sides. Under the disparity in the number of Chinese and Western medicine, give us a puppet-style mixed election. Call us to enter the muddy water vat together and promote its corruption. If everyone votes, we will always be disappointed more and successful less. It is better to reveal the inside story and automatically give up the right to vote. It is still fragrant and crisp.</p>
<p>(Theory D) It is said that a so-called Central National Medical Center has been active for a month and has issued instructions to contact the National Medical Associations in various places to prepare for the election. Recently, we have also seen the so-called Central National Medical Center's instructions in the Medical Association and the National Medical Association. When I first saw it, I was stunned. I thought I was seeing things. Later, after a closer look, I started to laugh. It turns out that the Central National Medical Center can not only give instructions to their National Medical Association, but also give instructions to our Medical Association and the National Medical Association. What a presumption. Aren't we all clear? The first article of the National Medical Center rules clearly states that it is an academic institution. And its organizational law uses the method of electing directors. It is by no means an administrative official appointed by the government. Can academic institutions use instructions? I have not studied the rules of this official document style. Or it is the latest regulations, and it is not known. However, we are ignorant and have seen it for the first time. The director is proficient in law and is currently the President of the Supreme Court. I think it will not be a mistake, it will not disturb the regulations, it will not create a precedent, and it will never give instructions to our police association and the National Medical Association, which are irrelevant. And this strange phenomenon, I am afraid, is always a group of ignorant gentlemen sitting in the well. Once they hold the chicken feathers, they treat them as arrows and act recklessly in their inquiries. This generation has more than enough to do evil, but not enough to do good. We mix with him in one breath, and in the end there will be no good results. It is better to be elevated. Therefore, it is advocated that the mixed election will not be changed. I never want to vote.</p>
<p>In short, voting or not voting is a personal freedom. I think it is not a problem. However, according to the above-mentioned numbers, it seems that they are all pessimistic because of indignation. But pessimism is by no means a good method. And the few votes of the new medical community are missing. In the facts of the election, it will never have any impact. But I always think that the government wants citizens to elect and wants professional groups to elect. His purpose is to finally want him to vote. Do not give up the obligations of citizens and their own rights. Moreover, the government naturally treats the people equally, without likes and dislikes. In case of indignation and passivity, although there is no obstacle in the election, there will still be a stain in the history of the election. So I hope everyone is calm and consider it again. It seems more appropriate.</p>
<h3>A Record of the St. Blasien Lung Sanatorium (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>St. Blasien, S. Blasien, is a German translation of the Pearl of the Black Forest in Southern Germany, a holy place for sanatoriums. In recent centuries, scholars have emerged on the relationship between tuberculosis treatment and climate, which has been well known to the world. However, in fact, the climate of general high mountains is not completely suitable for the treatment of tuberculosis, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the medium-sized mountains of St. Blasien have mostly good effects on various types of pulmonary tuberculosis. This kind of not very huge but average stimulus has an extremely beneficial effect on the ability to strengthen life and the tendency to improve the healing of the disease. The extremely small amount of scattered temperature in the mountains has the function of saving the vitality of the disease and promoting the healing of tuberculosis, which is something that the high mountain climate cannot reach. The danger of excessive stimulation, for fresh pulmonary tuberculosis, or excessively weak and neurotic patients, which cannot be tolerated in the high mountain climate, can be avoided here.</p>
<p>Above the Albra River, a tributary of the Rhine River, there is a valley, 800 meters high, which is the famous Black Forest of Southern Germany. The St. Blasien Valley is located between them. From north to south, the peaks are aligned, like a natural barrier. The sanatorium faces south to north, almost surrounded by pine ridges, with exceptionally rich sunlight and sky light. The ground air pressure is low, the air does not contain woven seats, the wind direction is stable and there is little fog, it is cool in the late summer, and there is more sunshine in the winter. In addition, the transportation is convenient and the construction is fierce. After a lot of scholarly climate research and proof, it has become a suitable climate for tuberculosis sanatoriums.</p>
<p>History The St. Blasien Sanatorium began to treat pulmonary tuberculosis as early as 1882. The founder was Dr. Paul Haufe. Since then, it has gradually expanded. In 1895, Dr. Albert Sander added a new building, expanding from 35 beds to 120 beds. From then on, the reputation of the sanatorium has increased day by day, and it has attracted the attention of doctors and patients from all over the world.</p>
<p>In 1914, Professor Bacmister took over as the director of the hospital. Bai also served as a professor at the University of Friborg and devoted himself to effective treatments, such as light therapy and surgery.</p>
<p>The sanatorium is located among the green meadows of the pine ridges, with a peak of 1,200 meters high, facing south. In the space of 150 meters, new gardens were built between 1923 and 25. The hills were decorated with bean sheds and flower racks, and there were fountains, with splashing beads and flying jade, and the flowers were like brocade. Even in late autumn, it presents a magnificent look. It is pleasing to the eye for patients to recuperate here. If you lie down and rest, a wooden shed is built for it, which can be used in both summer and winter.</p>
<p>The internal arrangement is aimed at being beautiful and hygienic, and it does not lose the style of the home everywhere, and there is no stimulation of the hospital scene. All corridors, stairs, lounges, large restaurants, and isolated small dining rooms are designed by experts. For example, the huge windows of the lounge are filled with evergreen plants, giving people a special kind of comfort. The four walls of the large restaurant are made of marble, in brown and yellow, so that there is no cold feeling. The four murals are symbols of the soil, water, and fire, painted by Professor Heerte, and their meaning implicitly implies that the four are the source of health.</p>
<p>All the equipment in the hospital meets the conditions of hygiene and is easy to clean. The floors of all corridors, toilets, stairs, and public places are cleaned with oil. The material is silent Linoleum. Disinfection is performed after the patient is discharged from the hospital. The heating equipment in the hospital adopts the low-pressure steam method. All bedrooms have hot and cold water masks, all made of marble. The wardrobes are all located inside. Each room has a telephone, which can be used throughout Germany. The south of the room is a veranda for lying down and resting, equipped with radio equipment. If there is anything that requires a doctor or nurse, each room has a bell and light device to find it in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Outside the office downstairs, there are consultation rooms, operating rooms, ENT consultation rooms, X-ray rooms, chemical test rooms, dental offices, etc. Male and female bathrooms are separated. There is also a hot water treatment room, which can perform various steam and sitz baths and foot baths. Washing is done by steam. There is a barber shop and a grocery store in the hospital, as if it is a world apart.</p>
<p>Treatment Generally, patients with serious illnesses and no hope of recovery are not accepted. If there are progressive chronic lung diseases, pleurisy, tracheal asthma, chronic bronchitis, gland diseases, and "preventive treatment", such as patients with hereditary diseases, or patients with acquired weakness, they can get the result of improving resistance here. In short, the climate of St. Blasien is most suitable for the treatment of various lung diseases. It is worth noting that for patients with fresh early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, according to recent expert research, it is not suitable for high-altitude sanatoriums. It is in this mountain climate with a very slight difference in temperature (that is, without severe stimulation) that the best treatment conditions have been found.</p>

<h3>Sanitary Common Sense for Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(96) Morphological Abnormalities of the Nasal Septum</p>
<p>Anatomically, the nasal cavity can be divided into the nasal vestibule, the proper nasal cavity, and the accessory paranasal sinuses.  The proper nasal cavity has one opening in both the front and the back. The anterior opening, which connects to the outside, is the anterior naris. The posterior opening, which connects to the pharynx, is the posterior naris. The nasal septum divides it into the left and right cavities. The position of the nasal septum is almost vertical. It is shaped like a plate and the left and right sides are usually symmetrical. It is formed from a bony and cartilaginous base. The bony part is called the bony nasal septum. The upper part is the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The back part is the vomer. The cartilaginous nasal septum is the quadrangular septal cartilage that fills the anterior defect of the bony nasal septum.  There are two main types of morphological abnormalities of the nasal septum: one is due to the thickening of the covering mucosa (which is caused by chronic rhinitis), and the other is due to abnormalities of the bony or cartilaginous base. According to the abnormality of the base of the nasal septum, we can divide it into hypertrophy and curvature.  The hypertrophic shapes can be further divided into two types: spurs and crests. The shape of a spur is sharper. The shape of a crest is longer. Clinically, there are two main causes of nasal septum morphological abnormalities:</p>
<p>(1) Trauma - such as fractures or dislocations of the nasal septum. Children often fall easily, causing external forces to act on the nose, resulting in nasal septum deformities.  In adulthood, it is also often caused by trauma, but it is often accompanied by abnormalities in the external shape of the nose.</p>
<p>(2) Developmental abnormalities - one is excessive development of the nasal septum.</p>
<p>The other is a narrowing of the upper and lower diameter of the nasal cavity on the palatine bone.  The nasal septum is comparatively oversized. This situation is most common when breathing through the mouth due to adenoid hyperplasia.</p>
<p>The main symptom of this condition is unilateral nasal obstruction on the curved or hypertrophied side, or unilateral reflex neurological symptoms (such as migraine headaches and unilateral tinnitus, etc.). However, compensatory hypertrophy of the turbinate mucosa on the opposite side sometimes occurs, often causing bilateral nasal obstruction. If we use nasal speculum for examination, we will know that the site of occurrence of nasal septum deviation is often in the midline.  There are many types, and the scope is also different. Commonly there are C-shaped curvature, S-shaped curvature, C-shaped curvature with crests, and curvature with sharp spurs, etc. (refer to the attached diagrams). The curved side not only protrudes, but the other end is also correspondingly sunken.  Compensatory hypertrophy of the turbinate is commonly seen on the sunken side of the curvature. If it is a spur or crest, the other side is mostly flat.  Sometimes it can touch the turbinate on the same side.  At this time, the resulting reflex neurological symptoms are often severe.</p>
<p>The treatment of nasal septum deviation, spurs, or crests can only be sought through surgical operation. Surgical correction or removal is possible. Among the surgical methods, the one we appreciate the most is the Killian septoplasty. There are about four conditions suitable for performing the operation: (1) when there is a high degree of nasal obstruction, (2) when reflex neurological symptoms are significant, (3) when intranasal procedures are obstructed (such as washing for suppurative diseases of the paranasal sinuses and Eustachian tube ventilation, etc.), and (4) as a preparatory operation for other types of intranasal surgery.</p>

<h3>Native Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Labiatae</p>
<p>1.  Common Selfheal (Brunelia vulgaris, L.)</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows naturally in the mountains and fields and is a perennial herb. The stem is square, usually creeping on the ground, about 0.3 meters high, and the whole plant is densely covered with fine hairs. The leaves are opposite, with long petioles, oval or lanceolate, with entire or dentate margins, and rounded ends. The terminal spike-like inflorescences bloom with purple labiate flowers in early summer, rarely white ones. After flowering, the flower spikes turn dark brown, looking like they are dead, hence the name "Xiakucao" (summer withering herb).</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Xiakucao (Chuzhou Xiakucao) Herba Brunellae, is the dried flower spike collected. Market products are mixed with stems and leaves. Only those that are purely flower spikes are considered good products.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The whole plant contains 3.5% of soluble inorganic salts, of which about 68% is potassium chloride. It also contains a substance resembling an insoluble alkaloid.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology)  Decoction of Xiakucao, filtered by membrane analysis, yields total inorganic salts, which, when injected intravenously into rabbits, immediately causes a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in respiratory movement, and also exhibits a significant diuretic effect. Experiments with other potassium salts also show the same effect. Therefore, the main physiological effect of Xiakucao should be attributed to its potassium salt content.  The alkaloid in this plant has no significant physiological effect.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) It is traditionally said that Xiakucao has a diuretic effect and is used to treat gonorrhea. It has also been used as an important medicine for scrofula since ancient times. — Daily dose 5-10 grams, in decoction.</p>
<p>Example prescription: Erwei Xiakucao Tang, used to treat scrofula.</p>
<p>Xiakucao 8.0 grams, licorice 1.0 gram</p>
<p>Decoct above into 200 ml. Take in three divided doses daily. Depending on the condition, Ligusticum chuanxiong, rhubarb, and forsythia can be added.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Dental Common Sense (43)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 228) If a tooth is extracted and not replaced, what effect will it have on the adjacent and opposing teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Because there is no resistance, adjacent teeth will gradually become sparse, and opposing teeth will gradually grow out.</p>
<p>(Question 229) If one tooth is missing, how many teeth should be installed in the replacement?</p>
<p>Answer: There are usually two types of inlays. The first type requires only one porcelain tooth with a rubber or metal plate underneath, riding on the gums. This is called a denture. The second type requires three gold teeth (except for front teeth), one solid in the middle and two hollow on the sides, fitted over the adjacent teeth on the left and right, just like building a bridge. This is called a bridge. If two adjacent teeth are missing, the denture should have two teeth, and the bridge should have four teeth, and so on.</p>
<p>(Question 230) It is said that the old-fashioned tooth extraction in China involved a "bone-separating powder" that caused teeth to fall out painlessly on their own. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: I have also heard this said many times and have tried to find this medicine, but have not been able to. If this medicine is truly valuable, able to make teeth fall out on their own without anesthesia or pliers, then someone should have promoted this miraculous Chinese medicine and developed it on a large scale, and we should be able to see hospitals using "bone-separating powder" for tooth extraction everywhere in Shanghai! Why is it buried in the countryside, hiding like a hermit, letting Master Ma and Brother Pliers solve all tooth extraction problems? It can be seen that this medicine is unreliable.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Extra Tips in the Hotel Industry</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The Municipal Hotel Industry Association, in order to discuss the issue of extra tips, convened a temporary membership meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The meeting resolved that it was impossible to accept the provisions in the implementation method that stipulated that no security deposits could be taken and that tips given by guests should be turned over as aviation donations. Generally speaking, if there are already tips, why should there be extra tips? This kind of extra tip should be cracked down on.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the extra tip is often not given to the general waiters and porters, but is mostly distributed to the accountants and managers. This is a practice in the Shanghai hotel industry that has become almost legal due to custom. Since this kind of tip is distributed to the accountants and managers, the waiters and porters have to solicit tips from customers separately, hence tips have become extra. In essence, it is adding a tip on top of a tip, which is fundamentally unreasonable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this kind of tip is often not voluntary from the customer, but is mostly extorted. For example, the regular tip is stipulated as one, while the extra tip must be two, three, or four. For example, the other day a friend went to a hotel and rented a room for $1.20, stayed only one night, and the next day gave an extra tip of 20 cents. The porter refused to accept it, saying that rooms here have never taken a tip of 20 cents. As a result, he paid 40 cents, and looking at his face, he was still not completely satisfied. This kind of illegal extortion from guests is deeply hateful.</p>
<p>Renting a room already includes a tip, and then there is another tip on top of that. This not only shows no consideration for customers, but also makes excessive demands, which inevitably makes people afraid to go forward. This custom has become a trend, and it is quite difficult to reform. However, examining the reasons why this trend has developed, half is due to the various demands of the porters, and half is also due to the cultivation by some customers. Shanghai was originally a pit for spending money, and the hotel industry has become half a place for entertainment, regarding money and legal tender as if it doesn't matter at all. This lavish behavior is caused by about three types of people:</p>
<p>1.  Wealthy young masters, spending money like dirt, giving generous tips to show off their wealth. 2. Those who have nothing to do after work, playing mahjong in eight rounds, winning or losing a lot, not counting the tips, so-called gambling money is the easiest to find. 3. Socializing openly, equality between men and women, compatible language, eyes inviting hearts, then the hotel industry is also an excellent place for dating. This kind of behavior naturally doesn't count the tips, and is even more generous. With these three types of people, the appetites of the porters have been cultivated, so in addition to giving a regular tip, they also give an extra tip to them. Not only will they be rejected outright, but they will also be regarded as "rural bumpkins". Therefore, those who don't want to be bumpkins have no choice but to generously empty their pockets to win the porter's favor.</p>
<p>However, this kind of extra tip is naturally happily paid by the above three types of people, but ordinary honest businessmen and poor travelers are naturally very unwilling to pay this kind of tip that should not be paid. Therefore, the government's order to crack down on extra tips in the hotel industry is extremely necessary and shows a lot of consideration for guests. However, there are many obstacles to implementation. If you want to crack down on extra tips in the hotel industry, you must first fundamentally correct the regulations of the hotel industry.</p>
<p>It is said that the hotel's porters are not only required by the hotel to pay a security deposit, but also not paid wages. Therefore, those who work as porters rely entirely on extra tips for their livelihood. If they are cracked down on, then the porters' livelihoods will be exhausted. As for the security deposit, it is even more difficult to cancel, because most of the people who work as porters are idle people, and not many have sound character. If they see the customer's money and valuables and get ideas, although the hotel has regulations that money and valuables should be handed over to the accounting room, the procedures are too cumbersome and difficult to withdraw, so it cannot be fully implemented. Therefore, if you want to crack down on extra tips and cancel security deposits, you must first fundamentally transform the organization of the hotel industry.</p>
<h3>Lakeside Words</h3>
<p>— Lv Gang</p>
<p>Last night I could hardly sleep all night. I don't know what kind of psychology it was, but I always felt a bit ethereal in my heart: it seemed like a dewdrop was mixing on a lotus leaf, or like a piece of duckweed was floating on the water... I couldn't make it calm down no matter what. I can't say why, and I don't want to put the momentary actions of instability into those "malicious" words "not in their right mind" like you did. I know your original intention was naturally not like that. Because in fact it wasn't a question of whose "mind was confused." For a person, a thing, a kind of will, and the cause to which we are loyal... we have not been negligent. We have paid a lot of enthusiasm in our work. We are not stingy at all. This is not for anything else, and it can't be said that it is something that a person in a state of confusion can consciously do. This just illustrates the serious attitude and enthusiasm of a person with a career mind.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't blame you for having doubts about this matter, as long as it doesn't hinder your understanding of real life. I think it's not too much for a young person to have a skeptical attitude when understanding life. We often yearn for a future life, and we are often amazed by some new things, just like when you first started on this road, you felt a little uneasy and apprehensive. In fact, when you take each step steadfastly and firmly, you will just feel that this is just: "So that's how it is!" This is because we are still like children and don't quite understand human relationships and social customs. We can't put on a straight face to live our lives! We use the heat of youth to open up this difficult road. As you said, we can't live in a muddle-headed way, but a monotonous life makes us quietly lose our enthusiasm for our careers. I very much agree with what you said about promoting our work through mutual encouragement. I think that only in the same career of will can we quietly reduce the doubts and hesitations about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I usually often warned you. In the attitude of trusting a person and looking at a thing, you should observe from both positive and negative sides. You also said that you often make this careless mistake. I really didn't expect you to inadvertently start from this place that doesn't need to be doubted. This result will inevitably lead you down the opposite road. In human understanding, this is a cruel tragedy—and it is also from here that the tendency of idealism arises. I hope you are not as bad as described here and can quickly restrain yourself. Just like your criticism of me.</p>
<p>I respect you very much, especially your enthusiasm for your career. This morning, in a clear and gentle climate, I did not expect you to give me such sincere advice. If the train wasn't about to leave, I really couldn't bear to leave you with a painful smile. Things also happened to coincide. As soon as I got on the carriage, the train immediately started. If I was only one minute late, I would have missed the train. It was really lucky that I didn't miss it this time.</p>
<p>After the train started, my heartstrings were much calmer, and I didn't feel tired at all. I was actually able to finish reading two books on the train, which was unexpected. I reread "This is Just Spring". Some drizzle floated in through the window, startling me, and I then noticed the green wilderness in the suburbs, the blue mountains, the blue sky connecting with the green mountains... The car slowly crawled through the fields, passing one town after another, gradually approaching Songjiang. The time it stopped in Songjiang was not long, but it suddenly evoked an image in my mind. I imagined those sixty-odd young companions who came back from Songjiang. They were the same as us. Lost... I was angry, but I couldn't say a word. I silently looked at the small station, the platform, and the endless fields: I thought of the vast mountains and forests of the three eastern provinces mentioned in "A Corner of the Metropolis"...</p>
<p>At noon, the train finally stopped in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>We wandered around the lakeside for a while. The weather here wasn't as hot as most people think it is. Maybe it was because it was cloudy, and a cool breeze was blowing across the lake... It actually rained heavily in the afternoon, which was really unlucky, and our plan to tour the lake today had to be temporarily suspended. I didn't sleep well last night, so I took the opportunity to take a satisfying afternoon nap.</p>
<p>The night slowly unfolded, and we took a walk by the lake. Because we were worried that it would rain again at night, we didn't dare to be "night tourists". Bu and I were talking about the past years ago, which was really a bit unbearable to look back on!...</p>
<p>I hope tomorrow will be a sunny day, so that I can rest well at night. Seeing the distant fire by the lakeside, I thought of the meaning of the words "light" and also of the spark of fire pressing on my heart. I am willing to send you a hidden fantasy.</p>
<h3>San Taro (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>Seven or eight brothers were already lined up on the small open space outside the door. He gave them a brief and dry explanation, then issued an order to take the team towards the river. At the end of the river, in that gloomy, pitch-black darkness, they would find a small, damp house, which was now guarded by two armed soldiers. They had to open the door and drag out each of those criminals, lining them up in a vast wilderness; then set up machine guns, pull the firing pins and shoot sparks at them, taking them to another ethereal world.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his nerves spasmed sensitively, and his eyes were unnaturally filled with many shadows, angry faces, and tragic cries. In these shadows, in these faces, in these cries, there were the most familiar and the most unfamiliar to him: yet, they were all equally powerfully moving him, causing him pain. Slowly he remembered again, remembered his mother, who had been widowed when he was young and was now a female worker in a yarn factory, remembered her wrinkled, thin face, remembered her low voice.</p>
<p>"I can't keep you, people won't allow me to keep you, but you must remember clearly: I want the gift you bring me back to be the cries of foreign brothers, not the glory of the Emperor..."</p>
<p>He sighed bitterly and whispered to himself, "There is no hatred, we originally had no hatred!"</p>
<p>...His footsteps gradually slowed down unnaturally, and finally stopped. His eyes stared blankly into the distance, at the shadows of people wriggling slightly, at the damp little house immersed in darkness. Then, he slowly reached out, tore off the military cap that flashed the golden light of the cap badge, threw it hard on the ground, and turned his head and walked away in dismay.</p>
<h3>When I was in Dalian</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>The second time I went to Dalian was during the first anniversary of the establishment of Manchukuo. The military police and detectives (i.e., detectives) in Dalian were busy without rest, and the docks, train stations, and hotels were full of security nets everywhere. Before I left Yantai, I had already written a letter to a fellow villager who worked at the Beef Company to smooth out our relationship so as to avoid accidents in the future. The fellow villager sent a quick reply, and everything was done according to my wishes, so I boldly went to Dalian. On the ship and at the dock, I went through several interrogations by detectives. I answered fluently, and they even called my fellow villager's company to verify my identity. They acknowledged that I was indeed a member of their company, so there were no problems. However, they were still somewhat suspicious of me. They kept paying attention to my demeanor and clothes, as if they had already determined that I didn't look like a Beef Company employee. However, they couldn't find any flaws.</p>
<p>With the enthusiastic hospitality of my fellow villager Mr. Yi San, I settled down in their company. But the detectives were miserable. They came to this place every day, especially the cross-eyed one nicknamed "Mole" (Dalian people call locals "local bumpkins"). He came every day, sitting outside the counter, drinking tea, smoking cigarettes, and the clerks were all laughing and joking with him, because in Dalian, merchants dared not easily offend these people - detectives! Although he tried every means to get my secret from here, he took great pains, and he couldn't make a business deal out of me!</p>
<p>At first, Mr. Yi San accompanied me everywhere to visit fellow villagers and friends. Later, he said not to go out to look for people anymore, as this would easily arouse suspicion from the detectives and military police. If you just go to brothels, watch plays, and gamble at clubs every day, then you can be safe. These entertainments, except for watching plays, which I was slightly interested in, gambling and prostitution gave me a headache! So Mr. Yi San led me to stroll through the night market, stroll through the gardens, and sometimes go to opium dens to play around. Because he didn't have that much time on weekdays, we could only go to Xigang on Sundays to listen to Liu Kuitong's Shanghai-style opera. Sure enough, it worked well, and the detectives never came again.</p>
<p>"Why not try everything in the world, learn about it, come with me?"</p>
<p>Another fellow villager said to me like this. I felt that his words were right, and I should learn about everything. So I followed him to clubs, opium dens every day... Sure enough, I learned about many things I had never seen before. Those terrible things, countless Chinese people are buried in that terrible devil's den. I simply shuddered! I dare not go to see those shocking things again! That tyrannical master who used dangerous conspiracies to kill innocent slaves! How vicious! How cruel! It used the iron hand of power to cover the sun, let the light retreat behind the darkness, and recklessly slaughtered the slaves!</p>
<p>One night I went to the Naniwa-cho night market and met Gao Yunfeng at the door of "Liaodong Department Store". He was a chef in "Iwakura Yoko," and when he saw me, he insisted on taking me to his house to sit down. Naturally, I couldn't refuse, so I followed him to his house. To my surprise! He already had a family now, a young wife, and two boys who could already run! What surprised me the most was that his wife was actually a ×× girl. So I immediately had a bad impression of Yunfeng in my mind, "Why marry a ×× woman, maybe he will be loyal to ×× forever?"</p>
<p>We were talking, but she was standing aside without saying a word, her face full of melancholy and sadness, and her skin was a bit yellow, probably because she had quarreled with Yunfeng. But I couldn't help but ask Yunfeng:</p>
<p>"Why doesn't your wife speak? I hope to talk to her."</p>
<p>Yunfeng didn't say a word first but sighed! He looked at his wife, then lowered his head and said to me in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Linzi's (referring to his wife) brother, Ueki Saburo, originally worked at the South Manchurian Electric Company. In the spring, he was arrested and imprisoned for suspicion of inciting a strike, but was eventually released due to insufficient evidence. Later, he joined "Dalian Kisen Kaisha" as an accountant. During the Battle of Gubeikou, he and three young people secretly wrote wartime slogans everywhere. Unexpectedly, he was arrested again. This time he suffered severe torture, and his left arm was broken! His father heard the news about his son and immediately went to the government to declare that the country should severely punish this kind of traitor! He no longer recognized him as his son. As a result, Ueki Saburo was sentenced to death! He and his three comrades were shot the day before yesterday. Linzi had the best relationship with her brother. Now that her brother is dead, how can she not be sad? Even I am very sad. I lost a good friend!"</p>
<p>Seeing Yunfeng and his wife both shed tears, I was silent for a long time without saying a word.</p>
<p>After dinner, I returned to Shuanghe Sheng Beef Company. The clerks were putting up the door panels. As soon as I entered the door, the third boss asked me: "Mr. Qin, where did you go? Yi San was worried and went outside to look for you!"</p>
<p>When Yi San came back, I said many words of apology to him. In bed, I thought of Ueki Saburo.</p>
<p>"We lost a friend!"</p>
<h3>Under the Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>That intensely hot weather is here again. During the day, the sun bakes the asphalt streets of the metropolis, even melting the asphalt. People rush about under the sun, planning for the day’s living, their minds dizzy, their eyes a little blurred, walking unsteadily, as if about to collapse.</p>
<p>"If I could really just fall down and not have to worry about anything, not have to worry about any more hard times, that would be great." Old Guan couldn't help but think miserably like that as he walked in the scorching sun. The monkey performing tricks squatted on his shoulder, baking like a stove, and the little spotted dog he held by a leash with a bell hanging from it had its tongue stretched out long, presenting a terrifying sight. The heavy burden of miscellaneous goods pressed heavily on his other shoulder, cumbersome like an endless ancestral ritual of cruel reality. Also, his skinny, monkey-like fourteen-year-old child and twelve-year-old adopted daughter shouldered the practice spears and broadswords, struggling to follow behind the middle-aged man in his forties (but who looked more than ten years older than he was), tirelessly running around in the scorching summer sun, exhausted and worn out...</p>
<p>"Another hot day has arrived," As soon as he thought of this, Old Guan felt a sour feeling rushing up in his heart. The helplessness and cruelty of life made him feel a little uncomfortable - wasn't it also a hot day when he fled from his hometown with his wife and children, desperately seeking refuge? The wandering bandits in the fields were terrifying: they had also gone hungry for ten days in a row, had been dragged off to jail, and had begged without success... Over the past year, his wife had died under the grind of life, leaving behind two skin-and-bones children, squeezed into a group of vagrants, taught to use spears and batons, taught obscene ditties and Lianhua Luo ballads, while the father in his forties, with his graying hair, had been forged even crueler by the cruel life. He broke his children's bones, as if administering a poisonous punishment, while he waited with a terrifying grin for the audience to toss down one or two copper coins... (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Verse: "Floral Moon Linked Pearls"</p>
<p>The Spring River Flower Moon Night is most flourishing. The moon reflects the flower wall, flowers and moon together. Flowers love the bright moon, flowers love the moon. The moon moves the flower shadows, the moon moves the flowers. Flowers bloom waiting for the moon, the qin stops sounding. In the moon, urging the flowers, the drums beat wildly. The ground is covered with fallen flowers, golden ten-thousand characters. A crescent moon, a jade hairpin. The flowery world is always in spring. The monthly tide is always on time. The bright moon polishes a jade axe. Plum blossoms play on a bronze pipa three times. Jiang Lang's dream revolves around a flowering pen. Zhang Ziyou floats on a moon raft like an immortal. The face is like a peach blossom, the eyebrows like the moon. The moon in the water, the flower in the mirror. It's good to rely on the moon elder to convey the mandarin duck love story. Ask the flower slave to pick up the phoenix hairpin. Worshipping the moon and burning incense, emotions are sincere. Burying flowers and pitying jade, resentment is endless. Reed flowers, autumn moon, Xunyang guest. Lonely moon, plum blossoms, hermit's home. The moon palace broadcasts good news, startling the sweeping star. Flower steps with moon, phoenix-headed shoes. Trying to scoop the moon from the water is futile. Looking at flowers in the fog, the mood is good. The mast moon, missing people, sad moon pavilion. The flowers pass the imperial exam, walking on the main street. Fairy Chang'e lives in the lunar palace. Jade Maiden wipes the water chestnut flower mirror. Want to roll up the bead curtain and cage the night moon. To delete evil deeds and pour famous flowers. Falling flowers, crows, spring sorrow waters. Slanting moon, waning lamp, night dreams are extravagant. Planting flowers in the moon to prevent rain jealousy. The round flower leaks the moon, hidden by clouds. Drinking wine in the flower bushes, playful bees dance. The moon cave blows chapters, attracting phoenixes to harmonize. The moon is a heavy quilt, the flowers are pillows. The flowers are the four walls, the moon is the home. Heavenly flowers fall chaotically, confusing flower shadows. The autumn moon is always round, watching the moon's brilliance. Cold moon, waning wind, spring loneliness. Idle flowers, defeated willows, the road is crooked. White clouds for thousands of miles, the moon at the border pass. Blue blood for a thousand years, the emperor's flower. Having the moon without flowers is truly lacking in interest. Having flowers without the moon is quietly uninteresting. From now on. Flowers in the morning, moon in the evening, passing the years.</p>
<p>He Zhifang, He Qinfang's Double Pearl Ball</p>
<p>Lin Ji (1220) 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Verse: "Daiyu Burning Drafts"</p>
<p>Wind and rain for consecutive nights, iron horses noisy. Good flower branches deserted in the Grand View Garden. There is no sound in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. There is a, sick beauty with tears hanging. Heart anxiously. Tears hanging. Sound silently. Night long. Listen to that, the sound of gongs and drums over the wall. Meeting the maid, Qin Fang Gate. Why so sad to this extent. Not knowing, the ignorant maid speaks plainly. Master Er is completing the wedding ceremony tonight. Young husband and wife reunite. Only keeps you, Concubine Xiaoxiang, in the dark. Hearing a word. The intestines break. A burst of sadness, a burst of sourness. Like that, ten thousand steel knives piercing the heart. Staggering footsteps, the heart is dazed. The familiar garden seems like a strange road. Fortunately, the confidante maid, Zijuan, knows. Helping each other to return to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Taking that, the old handkerchief and new poems are burned. Maiden's articles cannot be passed down. And now falling ill on the bed. She has always been least fond of medicine. Heart disease is difficult to cure with heart medicine. Sadly facing the Yellow Springs in the wind and rain. Leaving the world with unfinished business.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu's Righteous Demon Transmission</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening Verse: "Curtain Letter" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>It is lamentable, Han Xin of the past. He was originally, a struggling, wandering person in the Jianghu. At that time, he had not met the true lord of the Han Emperor. He seemed like, a dragon losing water, suffering. One day, he encountered an old woman washing cotton wadding. Begging for a meal, feeling deep gratitude. Later, repaying kindness with thousands of gold. He had no money, wandering the streets. Carrying a Longquan sword on his back. He was unwilling, to be teased by the butcher's children. He disregarded, the shame of suffering humiliation under the crotch. He abandoned his pen to join the army and enter the Han army. How could he, with a well-thought-out plan, not encounter good fortune. All because of, bragging after getting drunk. Almost, bound to the city to be executed and crippled. Therefore, he secretly ran away in the dark. Unexpectedly, Xiao He chased Han Xin in the moonlight. Fortunately, Xiao He was in Han.</p>
