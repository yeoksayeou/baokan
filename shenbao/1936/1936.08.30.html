<p>玉斯美　太平洋學會昨賡續討論世界和平與九國公約問題、首由英國代表卽該國前海軍大臣亞歷山大宣稱、維持世界和平一項問題、其主要關鍵、在於美國之態度、質言之、卽一旦發生戰爭恐慌之時、美國是否準備出而支持集體安全制是也、英國另一代表維格蘭姆爵士、則就海軍均勢問題、有所論列、略謂他日若因日本逾量造艦、而致各國海軍軍備競爭、趨於劇烈、則英國對於現行五·五·三比率、至少當予維持云、决由法國代表、卽該國前國務總理薩勞、就九國公約問題、發表意見、大意謂、當關係各國會同簽訂該公約之際、原擬列入制裁條欵、俾遇有違反公的情事、卽可相機加以應付、嗣因美國故總統哈定、力持異議、致未成為事實、此項公約所由未能發生實效者、其故卽在於此、但余意欲圖補救、亦無需重訂新的、僅將制裁條欵、列入現行九國公約之中、為事已足云、最疑乃由蘇聯代表莫蒂萊夫發言、謂太平洋上集體安全制、能否維持、其關鍵不在蘇聯方面、則以蘇聯早已具有此種誠意、觀於本國歷來與外園所訂各項恊定、莫不以鞏固和平為其目的、卽足覘之矣」云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>玉斯美　太平洋學會今晨續開圓桌會議、法國代表發言、以為九國公約之失效、美國實尸其咎、至失敗原因、則在一九二二年舉行華盛頓會議時、美國拒絕實施制裁、藉以維謎該約、但該的現仍有效、且已成為一種區域公約、但欲求其發生實效、則必須增加制裁條欵、使其成為與國聯盟約相似之世界公約、美國代表宣稱、美國今已担負協商義務、藉以預防戰事、美國參加一九三五年阿眞廷和平公約、卽係其例、至日本代表對於九國公約業己改走態度、各國代表咸信世界如退化至條約等於廢紙之狀態、則集體保安制度實不可能、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<p>玉斯美　太平洋學會今日續開圓桌會議、英國代表提出警告稱、日本如開始國際造艦競爭、英國亦將不顧一切、斷然保持目前英日海軍五與三之比、或竟增加至二與一之比·亦所不惜、英國雖不願從事造艦競爭、僅欲維持海軍現狀、但亦不願日本任意破壞英美日海軍五·五·三之比、日本代表對此警告視若無覩、僅注意直接影饗太平洋局勢之各項問題、日代表宣稱，日本願意簽訂太平洋新區域公約、但須以對華直接談判為條件、但各國代表咸信日本對此公約必堅持維持遠東現狀、中國則必將堅持恢復日本侵佔滿洲與熱河前之原狀、因以為此項公約决無成功希望云、中國代表並稱、日俄戰爭威脅必先袪除、始能談判此項公約、蘇俄代表則稱、太平洋方面目前政局實不利於履行條約、但蘇俄對此項新公的决不阻碍其談判云、（二十八日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c22">太平洋問題之全面的展開 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>太平洋學術會議從開幕到現在經過了兩星期的熱烈的討論問題的重心、由美國的孤立政。轉移到菲律賓的永久中立問題。由英日在南太平洋的商品巿塲的衝突轉移到遠東問題由遠東問題更具體地討論到日蘇的對立。英美和日本的對立。日德同盟的可能性及其對於國際新局勢的影響。最後則綜合地討論到太平洋的和平組織問題。</p>
<p>這一會議表面上雖只掛着學術的招牌似乎不含任何政治的意義可是在國際關係極其錯綜複雜的今日無論什麽國際會議那裏能超然于政治的漩渦以外所以太平洋學術會議的性質可以說是太平洋關係各國正式會議的試探其經過和其結果是非常値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>在這次會議中有兩個主要的特點第一討論的問題能把握住衝突的中心。將經濟的政治的軍事的諸種問題。熔為一爐。而以經濟的利益衝突為出發點以日本勢力的向外發展為中心把太平洋問題從局部的展開為全面的把列强國際關係組織的機構和盤托出第二蘇俄的初次被邀參加太平洋學會足以證明太平洋有利益關係的列强已不忽視蘇俄這一環這是在太平洋風雲激盪中的和平因素。對侵略者的侵略行動。是有莫大的制裁力量的可是正因為具備了以上兩個特點所以問題更來得複雜而熱烈的爭論和正面的衝突便成為會議中的唯一特色。</p>
<p>首先我們應該提出的是日本的立塲什麽是日本的立塲昵日代表芳澤提出了人口膨脹的謬論作為侵華的理論的根據同時又提出了大和民族的優越性作為其商品傾銷世界市塲的唯一的理由因此日本堅持着對華獨占的原則海軍平等權的主張並提出了修改九國公約的要求。</p>
<p>英國對於日本這一立塲當然是反對的但它並沒有放棄對日妥協約原則英代表曾警告日本「勿自陷於孤立的地位」這無異明白地說「日本應和英國合了夥共同解决遠東問題」。</p>
<p>其次舉足重輕的美國的立塲究竟如何昵美國的立塲可以把美代表麥唐納的話拿來做根據他說「要保持遠東和平必須承認三項根本原則卽其他列强應承認日本在遠東的特殊地位。中國應决心維護其獨立。日本應認識其他各國决不願放棄其遠東方面的利益」。這種論調。明顯地指示着今後的遠東問題。在日本切實地承認尊重各國在華利益的原則之下。大有妥協約可能。</p>
<p>在這種空氣之下以凱洛格非戰公約為基礎的九國公約修改問題遂由加拿大代表提出。而日本也表示接受這一原則。此項消息。將來為風為雨。我們在目前雖未敢預料但這顯然是列强對侵略者的讓步舉動。我們應當密切注視其前途的發展。</p>

<p>我們中國超過義務敎育年齡的失學靑年和成年男女民衆、約計有二萬萬二百餘萬、佔全國人口的半數、此項民衆、都是十六歲以上、正是年富力强為效力社會的中堅份子、舉凡社會的勞動、事業的經營、地方的保衛、家庭的服務、和一切建設事業、生產事業、均賴他們的活動力量、所以就他們在社會上的地位設起來、實在是非常重要、但是他們因種種關係、在學齡期內、未受敎育、年齡長大、仍未受敎、以致不識不知、常識缺乏能力薄弱、形成了社會的組織而不　全、國家的基礎而不鞏固、現在唯一的補救辦法、就是要他們趕快受到一種短期的補習敎育、使獲得公民必備和　活必需的某本常識、具育民族意識、國家觀念、能够守紀律、負責任、有組織、有能力、精誠團結、禦　圖存、以增加國家無量的實力、所以、中央在十八年、會經有「厲行成年民衆補習敎育」的决議、敎育部於十八年開全國第二次敎育會議時、就提出成年民衆補習敎育初步計劃、均經一致决議通過、但該項計劃需費頗鉅、每年約需六千多萬元、因為當時國庫支絀、而且天災人禍、相迫而來、以致無形擱置、不能大規模的施行、敎育部鑒於這種情形、乃公布民衆學校辦法大綱、督促各省市遵照施行　但因各省市大多數都是自由舉辦、無整個的計劃、無强迫的限期、所以自十七年至二十三年的七年常中、統計結果、各省市受過民衆學校敎育的人數、僅有六百七十餘萬人、平均計算、每年不到一百萬人、今後如果照這秤辦法遷移下去、須二百多年以後、方能够將這二萬萬以上的文盲掃除、這是何等嚴重迫切的一個問題啊、民國二十年國民政府公布的中華民國訓政時期約法第五十倏規定、「已達學齡之兒童、應一律受義務敎育、其詳以法律定之」、第五十一條規定、「未受義務敎育之人民應一律受成年補習敎育、其詳以法雜定之」、二十五年宣佈的中華民國憲法草案第一百三十五條規定、「六歲至十二歲之學齡兒童、一律受基本敎育、免納學費、其詳以法律定之」、第一百三十六條規定、「已逾學齡、未受基本敎育之人民、一律受補習敎育、免納學費、其詳以法律定之」、可見約法上和憲法上、對於義務敎育和補習敎育、已經是同樣規定、同樣重視、但是按諸事實、失學的學齡兒童、全國統計、不過三千七百餘萬、而失學的靑年和成人、則有二萬萬二百餘萬、較之學齡兒童數目超過六倍、近年以來、政府對於義務敎育、業已籌撥鉅欵、大規模的舉辦、添設許多小學、設法使之受到義務敎育、對於六倍此數之失學靑年和成人、也應該設法使之受到補習敎育、以符國家立法的要旨、而合同樣重視的事實、敎育部有見及此、所以在二十五年度敎育行政計劃內、規定實施失學民衆補習敎育、推廣民衆學校、使失學民衆受到補習敎育、並擬具實施失學民衆補習敎育辦法大網、提經二十五年八月四日行政院第二百七十三次會議通過、於八月十五日通令各省市遵照辦理、於今後六年內完成這項計劃、這是國民政府　都南京以後十年來早欲實行而未果行的敎育上一件重大設施、也是敎育史上值得紀念的一件大事、其重要實比義務敎育更加　　、</p>

<p>兒童專刋苦·樂  子祥　　小朋友：　　「苦」和「樂」根本是二件絕不類同的事，一個人沒有永生受苦，也沒有永生享樂。　　我鄉—崑山—有句俗語說：「少時苦風吹過，老年苦眞正苦。」意思是說：「小時候要吃苦，在艱苦困難中去找尋眞正的快樂。」舉幾件簡易明瞭的事來說：　　一，種田　在烈日薰炙下，勞農們赤了脚，辛辛苦苦地：下種，挿秧，耘草……他們的工作是多麽的勞苦；但是到了秋天收穫的時候，他們的內心是多麽的快樂。　　二，吃藥　生了病，必須吃藥，藥味是很苦的；但是吃了藥，病愈了，這病愈後的身體是多麽快樂。　　三，解算術　在算術書上，演到一個很難解答的算術題，解了好久，得不到正確的答數來，這時是多麽的苦悶呀！但是，你不怕苦悶，繼續用着腦力，左思右想，正確的答數求到了。那時你是多麽的快樂呀！　　四，國難這般嚴重，敵人步步進逼，同胞的內心是多麽的苦痛，可是到了全國一致團結起來，武裝起來，把敵人驅走，舉國同胞是多麽的快樂呀！　　小朋友！從上面幾個實例，已經可以知道：「先苦後樂」，「由艱苦困難中找尋眞正快樂」是金科玉律，萬世不磨的至理名言。小朋友！牢記着！牢記着這話，來鍛鍊自己的身體，充實自己的智識。幼童掌故隨談  易生　　毓會異辭　　諸位小朋友中有讀過或聽人講過三國志的，當然知道當時魏國有一個鍾會，奉令滅蜀，憑他的奇謀雄略，建下大大的功勞：可惜他後來變心謀反，只落得身名俱裂　這鍾會有一個哥哥呌鍾毓，他兄弟倆從小就有名聲。當鍾會十三歲時，魏文帝吩咐他父親鍾繇率領這小兄弟倆同去朝見。帝見毓面流汗，便問也：『為何多汙？』他回道：『戰戰惶惶汗出如漿！』帝回頭問會：『那麽』，為何你沒有汗？他却回道：『戰戰慄慄，汗不敢出！』這小兄弟倆也眞會頑皮，有一天，乘着父親畫寢之際，忽發異想偷喝起家要的藥酒來。恰巧鍾繇醒轉，便假裝睡着偷看他倆的鬼張智，只見毓拜了纔喝，會却喝了不拜。停一會兒，父親問毓：『偷喝酒拜些什麽？』他回道：『酒以成禮，不敢不拜。』父親回頭問會：『那麽，為何你不拜？』却回道：『偷本違禮，所以不拜。』　　聽着這人的口氣，可以知其性度，這也是鑑人於微的一法。但聽這鍾家小兄弟倆的話頭，顯然一個是拘謹之流，那一個是詭譎之輩了！再者，在同一椿事伴，同一個遭際上，輒可各行其是，各據一理：又可見天下少有眞是非，祇須你們能自圓其說便得了。孩子們有這麽的辯才，而又出在一家，自是難得的。西瓜的自述  君朋　　我是果類植物的一種，名呌「西瓜」，小朋友們！你可知道我的出身嗎？我記得在五代的時候，中國派胡嶠那個將軍，來征我的出身地——契丹，於是他吃了我以後，覺得鮮甜可口，便帶了我的子孫—西瓜子—到中國來。後來據我的同伴說：「五代時候，中國的浙東，已有我們在那裏了」，但我那時還沒有呌「西瓜」呢？　　我的而目，你們大家都認識我的，住在上海都市裏的小朋友，或許對於我身體上的各部分，還沒有明白吧！你們可知道我有手足嗎？有！有的！就是卷鬚。我的枝葉，所以能够向西方發展出去，都是靠它—卷鬚—的活動，豈不像手足一樣嗎？葉子有三裂至七裂，略像羽狀復葉，我們夫婦生出來就在一枝上，人們呌做雌雄同株。我的果實很大，裏面的肉呌「瓤」，有紅的，黃的，白的，在溽暑逼人的當兒，人們就吃我，味甜多汁，足以解喝，是人們在夏犬水果中最能解渴的一種。　　我的「瓤」裏面，究竟含有什麽成分呢？據名醫學家雪泰大博士研究我的結果：瓜肉中，含有水分九五、　六，含水炭素二、八七，蛋白質含〇、七八，灰分含〇、二〇，脂肪含〇、一〇，纖維含〇、〇九，含糖的分量，六至八％，中心部分，含葡萄糖，蔗糖最多，周圍部分較少，近外皮部分最少，維他命也含得很多，但我勸小朋友們！不要多吃，因為我是植物，不容易消化，對於胃腸臟是有弊害的。改良我們的書包  秦震　　現在是開學的時節了，我們小學生又得提着我們那手提箱式的書包上學去了。眞不知道是誰想出來用這種手提箱式的書包的？非但在形式上很難看，像那些跑酒菜館兜航空獎券，兜牙刷牙膏的人一樣。而且又硬又笨，無論提着擺着，總是很麻煩；要如東西裝得多，分量重一些，那末提皮包的一個手，不免要格外的往下沉一些，因此，連帶牽動了肩部，這不但在姿勢上很難看，就是在生理上，也不見得全無影響吧！　　我住在北四川路時，看見日本小學的學生，無論男女，每人都有一隻背在背部上的書包（皮製布製都有），而用兩根帶反綁着，這種書包，不但可以使我們的雙手都脫空，走路上車，格外安全，而且還可以强逼我們把前胸挺出，增加走路時候姿勢的美觀，和擴張肺部。　　我眞奇怪，為什麽便宜的日本貨，大家都要去買，而日本人的優點却大家都忽略呢？我們只要請國人自辦的皮革廠到日本店家去買一隻樣子，自己便可大量的倣造出來了。　　希望我這個小小的建議，能够得到敎育界中諸位先生的同情和提倡。不要看劍俠小說  牧　　前月三十日申報上登着一篇新聞，說上海錢江小學有兩位小朋友，因為平日醉心閱讀圖畫劍俠小說，志同道合，密切異常，且時向同學們說：「我們要到崑崙峨嵋諸名山去尋師，學習飛劍隱身等法術，以期効力國家。」聽的人以為他們說的痴話，不以為意。不料就在二十八日上午十時，那兩位小朋友突然失踪了。後來據識者說，他們看見那兩位小朋友各携包裹，往峨嵋崑崙山去求仙了。　　小朋友們！我們的國家確是已到存亡生死的關頭，我們的確是已到了「効力國家」的時候了。然而「効力國家，」第一，要天天起身早，鍛鍊身體，身體鍜鍊好了，對國家當然可効一分的力了。第二，我們一面出力効勞國家，一面要讀些有益的書本子。因為効力國家，不是盲動的，如果我們的頭腦充足，認識正確，誰是我們的敵人？誰是我們的友人？我們都能充分認識，不會認賊作父，認友為敵。這不是也很要緊的嗎？　　小朋友們！你不要相信這世界上是會有口吐白光的劍俠的，那只是那些劍俠小說上說說罷了。小朋友們！假使你眞要做劍俠，那末你只要依照我上邊所說的兩點做去，你就成為「効力國家」的劍俠了。　　小朋友們！不要看無益的劍俠小說，我們要看看有益的愛國故事或是救國故事才好呀！知了  陳治　　知了，知了，　　在枝頭高四：　　炎夏已到，　　暴日高照。　　它不管花草曬得枯倒，　　人們熱得難熬；　　它只把灼熱的光芒，　　直向地面噴放；　　它要把大地燒成瓦礫塲，　　一切生命都歸滅亡。　　啊，我們要圖存救亡，　　趕快起來抵抗！抵抗！自己造花園  惟經　　小朋友們，你們遊玩公園時，可曾感到公園中的一草一木，的佈置得適宜麽？同時，你們可曾感到公園，雖是一個好去處，只是離家太遠，往返感到不便麽？　　若是你們果有這種感想時，那麽，最好的卞法，便是哦們自己來造一個花園。　不過在都市中，尺土寸金，在事實上，也沒有隙地，可供我們造園，但是本刋是深入農村的，所以農村中的小朋友們，讀我此文時，若是有興，不妨試一下子。一旦造成之後，非但可以遊息其間，得到無上的快樂，覺得比了遊別人所造的公園，更有趣，同時，因須維持園圃的整潔，花卉的繁榮，不能不每天加以相當的勞動，這於健康方面，也是很有益的，而且因了每天在園圃中工作，每天和植物與小昆虫的接觸機會較多，在智識方面，也可有偉大的收穫。所以這一種玩意兒，可說是農村中小朋友們，課餘的最有意義，而且最有趣味的高尚娛樂。　　造園，雖然在書坊中，有「透園學一可買，但是園圃的構造，却是要選就着隙地的範圍而定的。所以小朋友們要造園，須得先自己斟酌。原有樹木的利用，花台的地位，幹徑支徑的支配，障碍物的安設，或拆除，或遷移等，都須鄭重考慮。總之，佈置須力求簡單，以免在目光中，因複雜而發生凌亂的不快之感。但同時，却又不可不佈置得過於率直，以免遊息於其中的，覺得一覽無餘。　　我的哥哥，是農校出身的，所以他對於造園學，頗有經騐。在十五年前，他因失業在家，於是合着我，和我的弟弟，三人之力，（那時我還在故鄕高小念書），把我們屋後的一個骯髒不堪的荒樹園，造成了一個很精緻而美麗的小花園。裏面，雖無溪流，山石的點綴，但是親戚朋友們，涉足其問，幾乎沒一個不稱贊妁，竟詡為地方　的「第一花園」。現在我把我們所造的小花園，簡單地介紹給小朋友們作參考。　　我們的花園的全部，約佔地六百方尺，是一個不正的方形，（見附圖）。向南是屋，其他三面，是原有的泥墻。門是開在東北角上，向北的。進門之後，是一帶八尺寬，四尺高的陳竹籬，上面爬着藤科植物。門與竹籬之間，夾着原有的一條二尺半寬的甬道，一直通平屋子裏。在這甬道的二旁，我們也結着疎眼籬，爬着藤科植物，（這種所在，若是栽上往頭冬靑，自然更好，因為藤科植物，在冬季中，是失却障碍物的作用的。）而在原有甬道的不同方向，更闢了幾條二尺寬的小徑，二旁都園以疎眼籬。圖中的「甲」，是原有的梧桐樹。「乙」，是桂花樹。「丙」，是皂莢樹。「丁」是楊柳樹。「戊」，是桃樹。「己」，是槐樹。「庚」，是被砍的樹基。「辛」，是補裁的黃楊樹。在屋後的「庚」字所在，便是我們夏季納凉的好所在。　　花台的佈置，是須另外一提的。設置花台的地位，若是四面有路的，該把花栽得中高而外低，如尖塔形。若是並非句圍在四路之中的，應把花栽得後高而前低，如梯形。至於花種的配置，也該注意使到之四季開花。最低的限度，也須在冬季中，有不凋的綠葉。否則，至多也不過可供春夏秋三季欣賞，便沒有多大的價值了。　　小朋友們，覺得這玩意兒有趣麽，若是覺得有趣，那麽不妨一試。蝙蝠  眞　　在一天的傍晚因為是蚊蟲多；敏兒家裏的晚餐，所以在六點多鐘已經吃了。吃好了晚餐，敏兒和他的兄弟姊妹等在家園裏乘凉，說說笑笑，很是快樂。敏兒手裏拿了一柄蒲扇，一面眼望着蔚藍的天空，堆滿着一朶朶美麗的彩霞，而更有一羣羣的烏鴉，啞啞啞的回家去了。旣而有一二頭的蝙蝠，徘徊在空中，這景象是很美麗動人的。　　「哥哥，你瞧，那一頭飛的是什麽烏？」敏兒的小弟弟是很驚奇的問着他的哥哥們。　　「你又胡纒了，那是蝙蝠，不是烏。敏弟，你也往往犯了這毛病，常常沒有看淸楚了東西，就批評這是什麽，那是什麽。你要知道蝙蝠和烏是沒有一些兒關係。它沒有生着尖尖的嘴，也不生羽毛，並也不是什麽老鼠偷了油而生着翅膀的。它實在是一種奇怪的動物，一生出來就有了翅膀，它的身子大小和形狀，差不多和鼠相同，也有和鼠一樣的細毛，因此有人誤會它是由鼠變成的。」　　「那麽它到底是那一種動物呢？」敏兒又問着他的哥哥——聰兒。　　「它是哺乳物的冀手類。大凡身子構造很完備的動物，都有明顯的乳頭或乳房，來儲備些乳汁，做幼兒最初的食物。這種動物並不像烏類用嘴巴去哺養幼兒，也不把孩子們丟在一邊，讓它們去碰自己的運氣，或是去找自己將來的活路，像愚蠢的爬行動物和魚類一般。而更有雌性的動物去撫養幼兒，並用自己的乳房裏的乳汁去養活它們。凡用乳汁去哺幼兒的動物，便呌它是有乳動物。不過我還要吿訴你們大部分的哺乳動物大都周身是生者毛髮，並不生羽毛，羽毛是屬於鳥類的。」　　「蝙蝠吃的是什麽東西？」　　「你要曉得蝙蝠吃的是什麽東西，只要看它的牙齒的形狀，這是敎我們書的先生對我們說的秘訣。我曾看見過蝙蝠的牙齒，所以我能回答介紹兒童日報　　上海兒童日報，自創刋以來，將屆一載，頗得國內大小朋友所稱譽。現自九月一日起，該報為引起全國兒童更高閱讀興趣起見，用彩色精印，而報費分文不加。該報內容，共分國內新聞，國外新聞，兒童公園，兒童創作四版。價目國內三月一元一角，半年二元一角，全年四元，郵費在內，並歡迎各地設立分銷處，章程函素卽寄，地址為上海海甯路華眞坊。兒童創作小朋友注意現在是秋天了  萬竹小學曹宏輝　　光陰似箭，一轉眼間，又是秋天到了。鄕下人家的田裏，所種的「棉稻玉蜀黍等，都要漸漸的成熟了，千字文中的一句「秋收冬藏」，那正是農人們最快樂的時候。　　這秋天的氣候，空氣最是新鮮，我們小朋友，在這時間裏，應該大家要多多的運動，要知道在空氣新鮮的時候運動，可以愉悅身心，休養腦力，增進知識，並且暑假也快期滿，不久就要開學，又是我們小朋友讀書的好機會了。那秋風吹到身上，精神上增加不少的爽快，腦力也更加活動了，　　不過秋天雖凉爽，我們小朋友，也應該注意到秋天的衛生，在家庭中，要研究怎樣撲滅蚊蠅，夜裏也不要　凉睡覺，日間那馬路上小販所賣不潔而腐爛的食物，不要貪便宜去買來吃。我們小朋友所最怕的事是疾病，但是我們用甚麽方法來避免疾病呢！必須要知道病的來源，我聽得先生說，「病從口入」，這句話，眞是一點也不錯，小朋友們大家要注意才是。國王與牧童（六）  新　　一天又人一天，一禮拜又一禮拜，一月又一月，悠悠地過去，而那黑頭髮的華樂和那黃頭髪的華樂仍在彼此想念着。那小王更覺脈倦他那沉長的功課，使他老是坐在門內，而給那些莊重的侍臣們包圍着。他一天天的渴想着獲得自由，好到小山旁邊隨意逛去。他尤其想在夜中跑到門外去，享受那黑暗的趣味。他每逢抬頭仰望着天上一輪憂鬱而莊嚴的月兒時，就起了一種奇怪的興奮的感覺。那月兒呀！伊放着淸奇而變幻的明光，籠罩着大地，往往會使那小王從睡夢中醒回來，靈魂也似乎顫動着，興奮得不能安睡。於是他很熱烈的妒羨那牧羊的孩子，這時正在月光松影之下吹着笛子。有一夜，他想望得實在太强烈了，在金床上翻來覆去的睡不着，他忽然想到那大殿堂的窗格是闊關的，儘可將他的小小身體擠將出去。（從前王宮中的窗上，都是用金屬物做窗格的，直到後來才用玻璃。）　　他在牀上直直的坐了起來。那窗外樹上的葉兒很神秘似的在瑟瑟地作響，小小的樹枝不住地打在窗格上，分明是招呼他走下牀來，於是他的心是决定了。他决意逃出宮去，到那白銀似的月光之中，和大自然去接近。他的心兀自在那裏跳動，當下他就從那高高的牀上溜了下來，躡足向着門走去，只聽得一聲很低的咆哮，一頭守門的大狗抬起它那挺大的頭來。呀！天哪！它要是吠出聲來，或跟着自己跑，那就得驚醒了門外面睡着的守衛，這就够麻煩了。幸而華樂記起了一根肉骨頭，本來要等到明天早上給它吃的，這時就拿了出來，塞在它的嘴裏，一霎時間，室中就充滿了狗啃骨頭的聲音。　　一個難關總算挨過去了。但他開出門去，一定要跨過一個守衛的身體，此人是夜夜口銜着刀子躺在門口守衛着的。也許此人竟醒了回來，如此華樂可就不能自由自在的跑出宮去，就不得不回到牀上去睡覺了。他抖顫着握住了門柄，輕輕的把那門拉了開來，只聽得一陣正規的鼾聲，表示他已睡得很甜哩。　　華樂略略有些害怕，攝手攝脚的溜下大樓梯去，一會兒就到了那大殿堂裏。夜風吹着四壁的壁衣，好像在那裏打顫。華樂並不覺得寒冷，但也不知不覺的打顫起來。高高的天空中，有一輪銀白色的明月，在流動的雲片中飛跑着。　　他走到了窗前，雙手握住了窗格。呀！天哪！這是什麽？原來那窗格上又新添上了許多豎直的鐵梗，唉！唉！他跑得太遲了，此刻無論如何，再也不能把身體擠將出去，他的王宮簡直是一座監獄哩。他沒法可想，一陣子的在窗格上用力地推着拉着，然而那裏推拉得動，他急得亂　着脚，擺動着身體，抽抽咽咽的哭了起來。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊國際情報西班牙人民陣綫的全貌  綠楓　　西班牙自一九三六年二月間的大選後，「民治」各黨結成的「人民陣綫」大告勝利，以凡拉台列斯為領袖的「反民洽」政府被迫下臺。接着人民陣綫政府宣佈大赦，把三萬拘留於監獄中的政治犯—多為「民治」各黨的黨人—恢復自由，又使二十萬農民獲得土地，因罷工而被開除的工人，亦正式下令准許其入廠工作。人民陣綫的政權大有益形鞏固之勢。　　可是人民陣綫政府忽略了「反民治」各黨的反攻：國家一切重要的經濟部門，以及政府各　構中，特別是軍隊和民團內，「反民治」各黨仍然佔着優越的地位和指揮權。「反民治」各黨經過了相當的準備後，即以著名保王黨領袖索台洛遇害為導火綫，於七月十八日在西屬摩洛哥，以正規軍的軍官富蘭科作領導，開始叛變。接着國內「反民治」各黨餘勢也相繼發難，向效忠政府的軍隊和民團進攻。這一戰爭現在正在作着最後的决鬬，究竟誰勝誰負，未便輕下斷語。現在我這裏所要報吿的，只是關於西班牙入民陣綫的內容和現狀。　　西班牙「民治」各黨組成人民陣綫之內在的原因，實由於過去五年中彼此相互傾軋，以致各種運動皆遭失敗之經騐。根據歷史上的敎訓，知道非有聯合一致的行動，運動决不會成功。如過去的社會黨會協助政府戰勝無政府工團主義，甚至把他們的領袖放逐到非洲去；但結果社會黨竟毫無所得，不過徒授敵人以隙而已。　　「民治」各黨旣有了以上的經騐，所以在選舉數月前，聯合陣綫的呼聲頗高。經過了相當時間的醞釀，社會黨左派領袖卡巴里柔卽提議與無政府工團主義派締結一種純粹戰略的協約，雙方仍保持獨立的組織與獨立的學說，但在行動方面則切實實行合作。這一協約提出了以後，其他「民治」各黨，如三個共和黨的左派，社會黨的中央派和右派，共產黨，工團主義派等都相繼參加。其實三年前統一馬克斯主義派所組織的「勞働者大同盟」，其最終目的也不過想把民洽」各黨的勢力聯結起來而已。　　各黨合作的條件，是實行最低限度的社會立法，包括土地拓殖，公共工程，以及執行現存的社會法等項。獨社會黨提有保留條件，卽在合作協約外，還有牠自己黨的政綱，如士地國有，生產品歸勞働者等等，此外社會黨並根據牠目前的策略，不參加組閣，以保持牠行動的自由。　　選舉的結果，於國會四百七十席中，人民陣綫得到了一百八十六席。其中社會黨為國會中最大的政黨，佔九十九席，共產黨佔十六席，無政府工團主義派佔三席；換句話說，其中有一百一十八席是屬於工農的。　　人民陣經中以社會黨的勢力最為根深蒂固，該黨所統治的「勞働老聯合會」目下有二百五十萬人。一九三四年的事變，除了加泰降那省之外，其他各地的主動者大都就是這個團體。同時該黨還有一種含有社會的，娛樂的，文化的性質的團體，呌做「卡沙司得蒲巴」的組織，以作各地黨員的聯絡機關，其勢力不下於各地方的政府。　　社會黨左派中最著名的領袖是卡巴里柔，是該黨的極端派，黨內靑年對他頗有信仰，他曾任西班牙王的樞密參議官。　　其次，社會黨中的强烈對流是中央派和右派形成的反對派。中央派力量較雄厚，領袖為普萊伊徒，他當過閣員，亞柴那曾請他組閣，後因左派的反對而罷。但他也能得到一部分黨人的信仰，因為他是個言出必行的實行家，有着貫徹到底的毅力。　　該黨右派是以白斯台約和沙包利特為頒袖。他們都是智識份子，相信漸進主義。　　此次選舉結果，使共產黨的勢力較前增大，這一方面是因為人民陣綫的讓與議席，一方面則是最近返國的該黨領袖所種下的種子。該黨領袖卡巴來路是個禿頭瘦臉，目光炯炯，短小精悍的人。他是石膏模型工人出身，握有有總公會的大權，同時又是社會主義民團領袖。在人民陣綫領導之下，還有一個團體也很有力量，這就是社會主義靑年　和另一個靑年團聯合組成的「統一靑年團」，這是一種運動和文化團體。國員現有六萬人。牠的組織很嚴密，而旦每一個團員都須受軍事訓鍊。　　人民陣綫，統一馬克期主義黨雖未正式參加，但該黨所組織的「勞動者大同盟」，於一九三四年也曾參加了「民治」各黨的活動。該黨是由托洛茨基和工農集團兩派組織而成，托派領袖甯氏為托氏的學生，為托氏忠實信徒，所以在行動方面，因托氏個人思想上的關係，而未能參加人民陣綫。　　此外的一支不可忽視的力量是無政府工團黨，據說黨員曾到過一百萬人：該黨自命為非政治組織，所謂工團卽是一種工會，以無政府主義作它的哲學。該黨有過二十年的歷史，曾為當局餒加取締，因內部組織偏於個人，所以異常散漫，竟一蹶不振；最近在沙拉格撒開全國代表大會，黨員又增至六十萬人。該黨因為不看重政洽行動，所以沒有參與人民陣綫，但過去那種視社會黨如仇敵的態度却已完全免除而又言歸於好了。實際上該黨的一切言行等於無形中帮助了人民陣綫。外埠郵政代辦所千奇百怪的舊木船  焦女士　　四川嘉定通訊　　橫貫我國，長九千九百餘里之揚子江，為國內第一大川，航政家以沿江河流水道之不同，分揚子為三段：自東海江口至江西九江為第一段（又稱長江下游）；九江至湖北宜昌為第二段（卽長江中流）；宜昌至重慶溯嘉陵江而至合川，統稱川江。在川江中，兩岸峭壁陸峙，灘流湍急，行舟極難而險。在汽船未通以前，來往川江中之唯一交通利器為舊式之柏木船（由柏木製成，川桐油　船內外，故名）。又曰廣船。因可來往蓉（成都），渝（重慶），萬縣，湘，鄂，廣　運輸貨物。自　船通行後，柏本船漸就淘汰，惟在川鄂湘間轉運磁器及在萬渝，渝合，渝叙　宜賓）間作短程航行的船隻，為數尚不下二千左右，種類繁多，形狀各別，其最普通者，約如下述之十餘種。</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>（一）貓魚鰍　因其形窄長如鰍得名，四櫂四櫓，專載鹽斤，可載重至三十　張鹽（張一萬斤），計三十餘萬斤或二十八萬餘斤。船夫自二三十人至五六十人甚至百人左右不等。上水可至瀘州，下水可至湖北沙市。船上工人有「頭工」一人俗稱「太公」掌管全船事務及指揮船伙。「打槓」（又名扳梢）一人或四人帮太公照應各事。外掌管一人，管理艙務，多由船老闆或小老闆自任。「掌天篙」一名，管理桅杆及風篷（卽帆）。「收牽簟」一人，管上水拉縴時收放縴繩。「舵工一人。「帮舵」或二人，打雜，伙夫（俗稱燒火老）各二人。拉縴的工友羣有「夫頭」一名，總管一切縴夫。除數十名拉縴夫外，另設「撿水筦」，此人須精通游泳，隨時要下水去整理絳繩，以免它夾入水中灘石縫，或斷落水中泅入急流深水覓取。又有「撿莞」一人，則專管陸上。此二人均不拉縴，僅跟着大隊人走，以備不時之需。蓋川河水勢奔騰，上水必須拉縴盤灘（意謂曲折盤旋而行）。輪運通行後，此等大運貨船已寥寥無幾了。　　（二）麻雀尾　尾如家雀，腹部特大，亦為運鹽船。大者載重二十餘萬斤，小者十餘萬斤。亦有四櫂四櫓。船夫數十人至百人不等。其特點為船頭寬，船底深，多往來於重慶宜昌之問。船巾組織與貓魚鰍略同。　　（三）老鴉秋　船唇窄，腹部寬，長條形，吃水淺而載重多，可容一萬至十一萬斤。船夫自三十至六七十人不等？主要貨物為煤，鹽，糧食，往來於涪江重慶合川間。　　（四）舵籠子　因船尾有籠一狀梢子篷護舵故名。載重三萬至十二萬斤。船夫十餘人至三十餘人。往來萬縣重慶間，無貨不裝，一應俱全。　　（五）安岳船　形似「老鴉秋」，惟船尾撐篷較短二尺許。載重三萬至七萬斤。輸運煤，糧食等物，往來涪江重慶合川間。船夫二十餘人。　　以上數種在以前實握有川河中權威，現在已遂漸减少，其所載貨物亦無往昔之多。現在比較通行的則有下列數種：　　（六）半頭船　大的可載二三十萬斤。來往萬縣到上游瀘州。船夫至多七八人。　　（七）竹筏子　從瀘州，白沙至重慶為止。係用大毛竹編成，類如木排。亦能載數千斤重量。樂山（卽嘉定）銅河中亦極多。船夫僅十餘人，縴夫多僱臨時短工。　　（八）駁船　又名小五板船，載重僅數千斤，由富順自流井產鹽區之鄧井關駁鹽斤至瀘州，再提上貓魚鰍大船。因往來便捷，可積少成多，故此等船朝夕排列於駁岸邊者動以百計。　　（九）大五板船　水漲時駁鹽多用大五板，其形狀與小五板略同，惟載重較多，少自六七千斤，多至四五萬斤，船夫亦少自十餘人，多至三十餘人。　　（十）神條子　形狹長故名，由湖南辰州河駛來川江，以載乾貨為大宗，在洞庭湖與長江中流時扯足風篷，行走極速。可裝十萬儎（即斤）左右。船上用人與川河船稍異，忌諱亦多。　　（十）（一）敞口麻陽船　因艙身特別寬大，故名敞口，專載貨物及鹽斤，可載十餘萬斤。船夫十餘人至三四十人不等。往來湘北川東。　　（十）（二）麻陽船　亦由湖南辰州河來，但不裝貨，專接差使（卽官吏與辦公人員）及行李箱籠，吃水最淺，載重不過四五千斤至萬斤而已。船夫最多時亦僅十餘人。每日朝發夕靠，傍晚卽不行舟（川江向例如此，但貨船有時可走至昏黑，而客船則停靠比較早也）。　　（十）（三）掛子船　有大小之分：四艙撑窗大掛子最軒敞；其次為三艙，四艙。亦係專載官客的船，吃水甚淺。船夫十餘人。載重數千斤至萬斤。外形大方，如淸制所穿之「外掛，故名。行走較貨船為迅捷。如遇要公差使，行李少，尙可用小掛子趕程。火把燈籠，照耀如白畫。惟十分險灘處，則趕至灘前灘後擇地停靠，候次日夫明，始能盤灘。　　（十）（四）櫓船　專用櫓搖，搖櫓時船夫數十，足踏嘴唱，名為橈歌（川人多稱船工為「橈夫子」如稱「轎夫子」之類）。此船由開縣小河出小江口，至萬縣，夔州（卽巴縣）為止。約載重五六千斤。不大用絲纜。　　（十）（五）神駁子　由雲陽廠裝鹽循嘉陵江轉長江到萬縣，載重五六千斤，行駛極速，形狀似神條子而更狹長。船上迷信亦深。例如不能覆碗；筷子要呌「濠竿」，「翻」字要說「轉」字等等，忌諱得了不得。　　（十）（六）黃瓜船　其形如半個黃瓜，又名巴河船，由巴河出合川至重慶為止。能裝貨萬斤左右。船夫數十人。櫓櫂各二，上水亦拉縴。　　（十）（七）歪屁股船　一名涪州船，駛於涪州公灘河中，到涪州為止，可載重五六千斤。其船形很特別，前半身如神駁子，而船尾偏斜，舵樓是歪的。船夫十餘人，水淺時始用縴拉。　　（十）（八）紅船　專管江中救生，船如貓魚鰍而小，輕快如飛，用木槳十餘個　齊划起來，瞬息數　里。水大時目可　灘而駛，往來便捷。官辦與　辦均有。大者亦可載重數千斤。船上夫役，水性更較其他船夫為優，以便拯救肇事船的乘客生命。目前，凡輪渡可通之處，差不多都預備得有救生小汽艇，這種紅船便逐漸被淘汰了。　　在川河中，每逢水大時，沐船與輪船同樣的平穩。如果水小時，自然狂流湍急，艱險萬端，水中礁石起伏，舟行為難。有時輪船更不敢去。最近民生　船公司為謀行旅安全，曾轟炸險灘數處，故目前瀘州至夔門一帶較少肇事之船，而上水盤灘亦覺省力多多矣。科學叢話皮蛋的化學成分  丹　　皮蛋有一種莫名其妙的臭味兒，但我們喫起來却又莫名其妙地覺得它很可口：皮蛋是雞蛋或鴨蛋製成的，它的體積和形狀與原來的雞蛋或鴨蛋的毫無不同，但它的顏色却本變了，無論蛋白和蛋黃都全不像原來的樣子。——你說這東西怪不怪？　　鄕下人知道怎樣製皮蛋，但却不明白為什麽皮蛋會有那樣的色素和味兒，只是覺得奇怪。城裏的讀書人喫皮蛋，並知道它的製成是由於化學作用，但却不明白這化學作用是怎樣的。據近代許多科學者的研究，才理解了皮蛋的凝固和變色變味是由於細菌作用。一九一六年K．Blunt和C．C．Wany兩氏曾將皮蛋作詳細的化學分析，並將它與新鮮蛋相比較，結果知道了在皮蛋製造中起了如下的主要變化：　　一，卵白水分的大部分移行淤蛋黃，一部分則透出蛋殼而消失於外了。因此，皮蛋內部往往沒有其外層部分（原來的蛋白部分）那樣的乾固。　　二，灰分及灰分鹽基度，興貯藏於亞爾加里中的蛋同樣，是增加了。　　三，以太侵出物减少，但其酸度却有增加。　　四，全窒素及萊西金窒素减少。　　五，不凝固窒素及亞姆尼亞態窒素增加，特別是後者的增加量很大。　　依據這個分析，他們更指出：在皮蛋製造中蛋白質及Phospholipoids要發生分解；新鮮蛋之皮蛋化，乃是由於若干鹽性物質，細菌及酵素的作用。　　同時，如果將皮蛋與各種腐壤蛋比較，兩者亦有許多類似點。但一般腐壞蛋大都有硫化水素的臭味，而皮蛋則無；它的臭味乃是很强的亞姆尼亞奧味。然而不管怎樣，皮蛋與腐壤蛋之類似，總是皮蛋製造中的細菌作用的表用。　　這樣由細菌作用所成的皮蛋，有臭味並與一般腐壞蛋相類似的皮蛋，依據通常的判斷，宜乎是很不衛生的。但是不然，據特梭氏在一九二六年的研究，由新鮮蛋變化為皮蛋，雖經過種種化學作用，細菌作用，但原來在新鮮蛋中的各種維他命，除維他命B全被破壞外，其他如維他命A和D幾乎與原來一樣地被保存着。依據這個研究，可知皮蛋並非不衛生的食品。　　至於皮蛋中特殊成分的含量，則如下表：　　這些特殊成分的作用如何？何以這些特殊成分綜合起來就成為了皮蛋？這却是很複雜的化學問題，我們無法詳細解說。同時，皮蛋大都有些奇妙的花紋，而且這花紋往往又與包它的灰的原物相類似，如用松柏樹葉燒過的灰來包成的皮蛋，那它將會現出類似松柏樹葉的花紋：這是什麽道理呢？當然也是奇妙的化學作用，但這作用是怎樣發生的？其結果何以會是那樣？現在似乎還沒有人能具體說明。所以，關於皮蛋的許多問題實在還須仔細研究，這不僅可以促進皮蛋製造的進步，而且在科學上也有很大的意義。幽默小品狡猾  伯明譯　　格麗賽是一個狡猾的女僕。一天，主人對她說：『我已邀了幾個朋友今天來吃晚飯，給我烤幾隻最出色的鷄。』　　『好呀，主人，』她答道。　　她走出去殺了兩隻最肥的鷄，把牠們收拾好預備烤去。　　下午，她把牠們放右火前的炙又上，這些全都已預備好了。經過相當時問後，她把牠們烤成了褐色。可是客人們還沒有到，因此她走到主人跟前，說：『假如讓這隻鷄再烤下去，要完全糟蹋掉了，他們若再不來吃掉牠，那眞是件可悲的，可羞的事！』　　因此，她主人說：『我自己把客人們去呌來。』便出去了。　　他剛轉過背，格麗賽就拿又和鷄放在一邊，想道：『我已在火旁立了這末久，使我十分口渴，誰知道他們要什麽時候才來哩？與其在等着，不如奔去酒倉裏小飲一下罷。』所以她拿起個瓶子，說：『對呀，格麗賽，你可暢飲一下了，酒是如此的迷惑人心呀！並且烤鷄的工作也不致有礙於你喝酒的。』她不停地喝着，直到瓶子裏空了才止。　　喝過酒，她走進廚房，把鷄再放在火前，塗上白塔油，把又不停地旋轉着，轉得這末急，使火把鷄烤成茶褐色，皮也皺縮起來。『假如他們仔仔細細地嘗牠的滋味，那他們絲毫不會把牠錯失一小塊的。』她對自己說。因此，她把指頭在烤鷄時承滴下的油脂的盆裏醮一下嘗嘗滋味，呌道：『啊唷，這鷄多好呀！這是個罪過，是個侮辱，此地竟沒有一個人吃牠們！』　　她奔向窗前，看看她的主人和客人是否在來了，可是她一個也沒有瞧見，於是她走去再立在鷄旁想道：『那隻鷄的一隻翅膀有些焦了，我最好偸偸吃了牠。』想到這裏，她便把那隻有些焦的翅膀割下吃了，吃起來滋味是這麽佳妙，當吃完後，她又想：『我得再吃那另一隻翅膀，主人絲毫不會注意到少了什麽的。』　　兩隻翅膀全吃掉後，格麗賽再去看看她的主人，可是仍然沒有影踪。　　以下接第五版應時文章螢—昆蟲界中的外科醫生  關琪　　暑氣已消，竹簾高捲，晚風從窗外吹來，躺在冰凉的簞上看往來的流螢，在屋角牆頭怯生生地飛舞，這是如何充滿了詩意的一剎那呵！「靑羅小扇撲流螢」早已喻為千古的韻事了。　　流螢不單做了詩人的主題，也做了點綴夏夜唯一的出色品。繁星在天，靑螢遍地，明光閃爍，上下爭輝，這是如何的神秘之夜呵。　　流螢最引人發生美感的，自然是牠携帶着的那盞小燈籠了，而這籠中的燈光又是那麽溫柔，那麽慘淡，那麽品熒，恰像月兒商下的一顆顆溫良的淚珠。所以希臘人給牠取了個美麗的名字，呌做Lampyre，意思是「携燈夜遊的詩魂」。　　有誰知道螢火的狀態及作用麽？研究過這束西的已經有不少的人了，有些化學家們將牠們捉去很殘酷地實騐過，看是否牠們身上帶了多量的燐，憐和氧氣化合便發出了這靑色的光？那知實騐的結果完全失敗。後來法國的昆蟲學者法布爾（Fabre）將螢的火用薄片樹葉輕輕掃在一張白布上，然後用顯微鏡去看，便看見林細的沙爍似的一粒粒發光的物質，將它再裝在眞空管裏，而這一粒粒的物質仍舊發光。但究竟是什麽物質，至今還沒有曉得。只知道不是從前一般人所肯定認為的燐就是了。　　螢光的强弱要以雌雄來分別。本來從幼蟲起，無論雌雄，尾端都有一朶微弱的火。可是到了成長，雄的便生翅膀，能够飛翔，這時牠的尾端後三節上節節都發出强大的光，這光一直照徹過背部，所以腹背二面，後三節通體明亮。雌的到了「靑春期」，不牛翅，不能飛，可是尾端三節左右增加了一條帶，帶上發出此雄性還强大的光；然而這光不能透過背部。　　螢的光在牠們本身有什麽作用？裝飾嗎？照黑路嗎？不是，都不是，這光是牠們結婚時的神聖的火炬呵。牠們靠了這光，使牠們的愛人有摸索的標的，不致失望找不着。不過，牠們的光所在的部位不同，雌的火光既在腹下，又爬着行，雄的怎麽看得見呢？本來雌的火光不透明，是因為牠不能飛行，若背上有光，便容易給敵人侵略，但對于牠的愛者當然有另外高妙的方法：雌的往往爬在沒有敵人的所在便跳起「草裙舞」來，扭尾巴，擺腰肢，使牠腹下的光易于給雄的看見，以達到牠們熱愛的目的。　　牠們結婚的時候，火光暫時熄滅；這大槪也為的是要保持幾分男女性行為的神秘吧！　　火光的明滅，牠們自己有主宰之權。無論雌雄，在發光帶的旁邊都有一根小小的管子，這管的一端可以隨時分成為許多小管；經法布爾的實騐，知道這條管子不屬于呼吸器管，而是專管空氣的出入，用以吹燃尾端的燈火以招誘異性，或熄滅這盞小燈籠好躱避敵人。　　螢的形態幷不如我們所想像的那麽美麗，牠完全和甲殼蟲一樣，背上披着堅硬的外皮，呈栗色，胸部微帶粉紅色，尾端每節的兩側有兩小塊亮栗色的甲。六足，口旁有一雙小鉗。雄者體小，能飛，雌者體較大，　走。　　我國古代的傳說認為螢是腐草變的。攷察這傳說的起源，無非是螢歡喜羣居在敗葉腐草之上的綠故。大家知道螢的食料是蜗牛。這種食品只有這潮濕腐敗的地方才容易獲得。螢捕食蝸牛的方法眞是再有趣不過的了。牠看見一隻蝸牛停在地上或正在爬行，便輕輕走攏去用它的脚表示親愛似的拍幾拍，蝸牛的身體趕快往殼內一縮，不動了。牠便用牠的雙鉗，將鉗內特有的一種麻醉劑向殼內注射進去，這隻蝸牛因而就毫無痛苦地上了「西天」　外科醫生們，你們別靠着你們的什麽以太，哥羅芳，哥加因……而驕傲罷，在你們連做夢都　沒有想到什麽麻醉劑的時候，昆蟲界中便已有這麽高妙的手術了。蝸牛死了之後，捕獲蝸牛的螢便展翅飛去，遍邀賓客；螢的羣于是各各灌注一些胃液，使蝸牛屍身腐爛，牠們等牠腐了之後才來暢飲這蝸牛湯。　　在非洲有種不發光的螢，常常停在蝸牛的殼上，耐心地等着蝸牛探出頭來呼吸或取飲食時，便一針注射下去，不動聲色地而得了一餐盛筵。　　螢有友朋之愛，夫婦之愛，可是缺乏親子之愛。交尾後很快就產卵，未來的母親從來不選擇產卵的地方，有時產在樹葉上，有時產在潮士上；產後也絲毫不問牠未來的兒女如何或何時降臨人世。可是螢的卵孵化得很快，一孵化後就能自立，不需要母親的什麽襁褓。　　奇怪得很，螢的卵白而圓，也能發光。法布爾有一次破開了一隻將要產卵的母螢，一串亮晶晶的閃着光的東西從他的指頭上流下去，他說恰像給他打破了一隻盛着氧化燐的瓶。　　螢的活動期在盛夏及初秋。天氣凉了，落葉飄下時，牠們便爬進地窖裏去躲避嚴冬。法布爾曾經捉了幾隻螢放在一個銅碗內，碗內盛了很厚的沙和一些敗葉；在最冷的時候，看見牠們鑽入沙內有三四寸深。雖然在深冬，蟄居的時候，牠們的尾端還是有一盞微弱的燈。　　冬去春來，萬物復蘇，在烏語花香的四月左右，牠們又爬到地上來進行牠們的蛻化和繁殖了。播音節目　　佩佩歌劇社　　敦本（八〇〇）中午十一時半至十二時半　　從軍別愛（秦燕）勇士凱歌（朱雯）祝您晚安（陳嫣）和平歌（王玨）母親（陳月芳）悲秋（朱雯）賣油條（王玨）賣花女（秦燕）　蹄下的歌女（陳嫣）音樂（戴倍佩）　　申新一廠俱樂部平劇　　東方（一〇二〇）下午二時，至四時三刻　　黃金台（荊殿英）法門寺（孫之鈺）戰蒲關（余漳基）賣馬當　（沈耀明，葉乃）蘇三起解（孫保琮）舉鼎觀畫（王楙麒）梅龍鎭（宓寃　，余璋基）捉放曹（余士能，榮本道）六月雪（榮憲章）　殿（朱仁高）</p>

<p>『誰知道哩，』她對自己說。『或許客人們並不來，甚至留着主人吃晚飯，所以她不回來了。噯，格麗賽！有這許多好東西留下給你呢；那塊鷄也使我口渴了，我在把這些好束西統吃掉之前，必須再喝一下酒。』　　所以她走進酒倉裏又喝了許多酒，然後回到廚房裏坐了下來，非常有滋味地把那隻鷄的剩餘部份都吃了。　　現在只剩下一隻鷄了，而她的主人還沒回來，格麗賽開始以渴望的眼睛瞧着那一隻：最後她說：『一隻鷄到了什麽地方，必須把另一隻也送到第一隻的所在地，緣於這些鷄是互相依附着的，並且一隻的滋味不錯，另一隻也一定不用說得；我得再喝一些酒，我相信它是不致有害於我的。』　　最後一次喝的酒給了她勇氣，她便回到廚房裏，讓第二隻鷄跟在第一隻之後送進肚子。　　當她正在享受着最後一口時，她的主人回家了。　　『趕快，格麗賽！』他呌道。『幾分鐘之內，客人們就要到了。』　　『是了，主人，』她答道。『卽刻就可完全準備好的。』　　同時，主人看見檯毯已舖上，各種東西都已放端整，所以他拿起預備割鷄的刀，出去到走廊下把牠在石塊上磨磨鋒利。　　當他正在磨刀時，客人們到了，他們緩緩地，有禮貌地敲着大門。格麗賽跑出去瞧瞧是誰，當她瞧見是客人時，便把手指放在嘴唇上，低聲地說：『別做聲！別做聲！跟你們來時一般迅速地回去吧！若是我主人捉住了你，那便不幸了；今晚請你們來吃晚飯，不為別的，是要割掉你們各人的兩隻耳朶呀。聽哪，你們可以聽得見他正在磨快刀呢。』　　客人們聽得這話，都儘可能的迅速地逃下階石，立刻都不見了。　　格麗賽不稍遲延，又急喊着奔向主人去，呌道：『的確，你請的好客人！』　　『咦，為什麽，格魔賽，什麽意思？』　　『啊！』她呌道。『他們剛才來過，我把兩隻鷄盛在盆子裏正想送來，却被他們搶去逃了。』　　『奇哉怪也！』主人說。他如此的傷心着失了他佳妙的一頓。他衝出去追踪這些偸兒。『假如他們只要留一隻給我，或是至少够我自己的一頓　』他呌着，跟在他們之後奔着：可是他呌他們停，他們愈逃得快。『只要一隻！只要一隻！』他的意思是　如他　給他留下『　只要一雙鷄』，但在客人們聽來以為他是在說：『只要一隻耳朶』，那便是他想要割的。他們逃着，像是火在他們周圍焚燒着，直到發覺自己兩隻耳朵並沒被抓着，而安全地坐在家裏才安心下來。業餘修學林語堂的學英語十三原則  林徒　　一，打定口講的基礎，只要能達到這目的，任何方法都可用。　　二，學生在課堂上，必須踴躍參加練習，不怕錯，不怕扣分數。　　三，凡遇新字，必耳聞口講手寫閱讀四事並重。　　四，應儘量在課室里操英語，聽英語，藉以吸收英文句法。　　五，注重倣傚與熟誦為養成正當習慣的最好方法，不可偏重理智分析和文法規則等。　　六，句義字義不明時，可一用翻譯方法，但不可專用翻譯為練習體裁，翻　句　的用處，可作比較，表示本國語與外國語語法之不同。　　七，注重字之用法，字義應看做活的，生動的，有變換的。不知一字之用法，不能算為懂其意義。　　八，注重日用成語虛字常見字用法，大體已備，生僻之字卽不難安揷下去。　　九，凡有意思要表現，必因敎員之利導，毅然嘗試。　　十，凡語英語，必說全句，不可僅限於Yes，No。等字，初時或覺困難，日後必有進步。　　十一，用客觀歸納的方法學習文法，卽時時注意字的形體變化及其用法。在讀本上，看見同類的變化，發生疑問，卽求文法的指示，以為解决。得了文法的指示之後，又須時時在讀本上觀其應變，以為印證。　　十二，必須有多少寫作的練習。　　十三，拚音須精，讀音須正。小小專著工業化的趨向  王棠　　資本主義發達以後，牠打破了以前工農業合一的制度。因為牠使農業經濟中的工業成份獨立起來了，且把農民變成農業小資產階級與無產階級的兩種對立。而前者又因市塲條件和借貸條件的關係，臣服於資本權威之下。同時，我們看見城市和鄕邨的分離，前者變成一個工業中心。這一個分化在國際也發現出來，西歐成為「世界的工業中心」，而其他區域就只是原料的供應地了，例如東印度就被逼為大不列顚產生棉毛大麻靛靑等等。　　然而不久，資本主義很容易的轉入工業的資本主義了，某幾門的工業，由地理上的便利，就在農業國內勃興起來。因為原料在半製造品的狀態中，能够以較少的運費來運輸。因此，許多農業國被工業化了。　　這個發展，和工業資本與銀行資本的開展台在一起，就形成了財政資本。　　工業化的過程，因世界大戰而更為加速，郵船的缺乏，運費的增高，交戰各國自己國內也缺乏工業品，因此更促進了沿海各農業國的工業發展，雖然那時機器與熟練工人尙感缺乏。　　戰後，資本國商業旺盛期又達頂點以後，那時，歐洲工業的生產機關又再度適應於和平狀態，而歐洲各工業國的出品又再度在農業區的市塲上火露其頭角，於是後者的各部門幼稚工業就立刻發現了嚴重的危機，許多在戰時如雨後春筍般透露生氣的東西，現在都崩潰　不能存在了。　　支持民族工業的努力，後面還跟着民族自衛的意義。世界大戰的經騐指出最後的軍備發展已决定了些什麽，卽每一個國家如果沒有牠自己的工業，在戰爭發生時就沒有力量可以操勝算。所以每個國家都在企圖用高度底保護關稅政策來培植牠在戰時所必需的那一部分工業。　　這樣，就不免參有了政治的意味。眞正的被壓迫殖民地，如埃及，高麗，法屬非洲等，當然沒有實行牠們自己的關稅政策的能力，卽如中國，關稅主權也為各帝國主義者很兇惡地限制着，被强制着只能採用全世界最低的稅率。但還有其他的許多國家，儘管牠們較衰弱於帝國主義列强，但牠們都努力來行使牠們的權力，以發展其獨立的關稅政策，而達到創設其自己的工業的目的。　　可是，各小國家雖有創設牠們自己的工業這一企圖，但有好幾部門是被限於國內消費量的微弱，因為牠們消費不了現代工業制度下的過量出品。結果是產生了許多不重要的小企業，這樣，各小國的關稅政策反成了生產力自由發展的一種障礙。　　所以，經濟狀態略為穩定之後，工業生產品的出售已成為歐洲各工業國的大問題，於是在反對各農業國的保護稅則制度上，就突起了一支新底經濟政治軍。我們祇要記起那有名的銀行團宣言就够了，這宣言對其中勉强工業化　出了一個警吿與减低保碟稅率。　　世界經濟會議的許多關於自由貿易的議决案，也仍是擱置在那裏沒有實際上的效力。沒有一個地方曾减低了關稅壁壘，「工業的人為促進」依然很興奮的繼續下去。　　在各農業國的工業加速退却的事實看來，農業化實在是必然的趨勢。——但這次不是舊型農業的回復了。　　我們且先看一看機器工業。機器出品有百分之八十五是集中在三個國家，卽德國英國和美國。新工業國家所得來的機器大都來自這三個國家。從下表可以知道，在絕對數上看，牠們的消費量是大於戰前，然在牠和世界消費量的百分比上就依然無所變更。　　以時價百萬馬克為單位之消費量　對世界消費量之百分比　　　　　　　〇五　二，六　　日本　三二四　〇，八　　中國　五四　〇，二　　英屬印度　二二五　一，〇　　亞洲其他各地　七六　〇，五　　澳大利亞　二九二　一，一　　南非聯邦　九九　〇，五　　非洲其餘各地　六八　〇，三　　不過在有幾個國家裏面，如英屬印度和澳大利亞，其機器工業是剛在開始，那機器消費量要比這個數目字大一點。然機器的產出依然是歐美工業的一個獨占品，新興工業國完全要靠歐美工業來置辦牠們的生產器具。總之，農業國發展的趨向還是些起碼的工業部門（例如各種紡織工業部門中的粗製棉業），而生產比較精製的工業品的各工業，是需要大於農業國家所能有的市塲，特殊熟　的工人，　　　　　　等，所以，最新的工　科學和最精的生產方式，都只是在老工業國家內才能採用。　　向着工業化的趨勢，在所有農業國的紡織工業的發展上最為顯著，如下表（棉紗錠數以千為單位）：　　在紡織工業的領域內，工業化趨勢是充分地表現出來。　　總結起來，我們可以肯定：由許多統計的材料中，已確定地證明了工業化　勢的存在，這和資本主義僅只把各殖民地拖入原料生產地的單純慾望，是有着不相同的情景的。　　扼要地重說一遍：我們看見自由競爭的資本主義要把沿海國家變成專為西歐生產原料和食料的農業區，而世界的工業區却在帝國主義的期間中碰着了資本輸出，保護稅率和戰爭等諸般强烈的反擊。因為要為工業生產找市塲，於是大戰後又引起帝國主義的工業資本去强迫弱小國家採農業化政策的企圖，可是這企圖終於為工業資產階級的一般利益和個人資本主義的特殊利益的矛盾所擋住了。　　工業化趨勢到底是今日經濟制度上唯一的寵兒。文藝作品回老家去（三）  大衛　　車不停地往前急進着。　　由車窗中望見了五里以外的地方，現出一片耀眼明光的上空；那就是被毒熟的火熖所溶化了的「新京」。　　十分鐘後，我們這一羣又被送進了長春—「新京」—的頭道溝車站。　　由瀋陽北行車，到此為終點。往哈爾濱須換乘舊中東路的哈長支綫的車—那時雖然中東路已經賣給了「滿洲國」，哈長綫還沒有正式換軌；但在後一個月，在「友邦」協助之下，用分段撤換法，在一句鐘後把全長六百里的鐵軌就換完了—我們這一羣為的要瞻仰瞻仰「王道政府」的「德政」，和「天堂樂土」的「順民」的「安樂生活」，就决定在長春停留一天。　　我們通過了地道，到了第一站臺：臺下停了一列精彩的花車，車上坐着一些特殊的人物。車旁站了一羣穿着灰色制服的十五六歲上下的學生，右手執着「友邦」的國旗，左手執着僞國的旗幟；是深夜了，有的像似已不堪久待的疲勞，和夜露的侵蝕，把旗子捲折起來夾在腋下，兩手塞進了褲袋裏；兩隻可憐得像似討饒的小眼睛，在銳利的燈光映照之下，四周轉着凄冷而又不敢落下的淚珠。一個有着瘦長的臉，黑髭，戴着眼鏡，兩手揷在黑色大衣袋裏的人，大槪就是敎師，走來走去地監視着這羣可憐的孩子。　　『這一定又是「友邦」的什麽偉人來了，把這羣可憐的孩子，這樣深夜弄到這車站上來！』　　老相底目光掃過了這羣可憐的孩子們底小臉兒，這樣感慨地說。　　『這倒是「奇跡」呵！我們也可來看一看他們倒底玩的什麽把戲？』我這樣提議着。　　『好！』大家都很贊同。　　我們就在較近的地方，假裝整理行李，以等待這一「奇跡」的開展。因為你若是不用這樣掩飾的方法，「王道衛士」們會疑心你有什麽「不法的行為」呢！　　我們把行李打開了又綑上；過了有十分鐘的光景。　　『歡迎××大人！』這羣可憐的孩子，見了那位西裝敎師（？）底右手一舉，就這樣高聲地呼喊起來。　　『滿洲國，是新天地……』接着一邊唱着使我們這一羣聽來非常生疏的調子的歌，一邊兩手還上下舞動着旗幟。　　我們底內心被這聲音震動得有些發抖，有些酸楚了！這是「歡呼」嗎？這活生生地是一羣失掉了父母的孩子在哀號呵！　　我們都盡力地壓抑着聽覺，想把這凄厲的呼聲遮斷。順便把視綫移到花車門口上去。　　在一羣肥的，瘦的某國紳士們和幾個穿着長袍馬甲的人們團團包圍之下，出現了一位載着高大禮帽的「友邦」偉人，那兩撇黑鬍支持着的兩個胖胖的臉蛋上掛着光榮的微笑。　　嘰哩咕嚐……這位偉人開始向這羣孩子們演說了。　　『××大人說：××滿的「親善」是「滿洲國」立國的基本條件……』那個敎師（？）覆述着。　　我們聽不淸楚，同時也不忍再聽下去了。　　我們感到了疲乏的重壓，急急地踅出了車站，投進了一家七年前我曾住過的旅館。　　在甜蜜的夢鄕中，還聽見一羣可憐的孩子們在呼喊着，呼喊着……　　早晨七點鐘左右，我們為街頭巨輪的聲音所震撼而驚醒轉來。胡亂吃了一些東西，奔到了十字街頭。　　首先觸到我們眼簾的就是寬敞整潔的柏油路，這樣的路政，恐怕除了帝國主義直接管理下的上海租界之外，在中國內地其他都市中是不易找得到的罷。　　柏油路兩旁都矗立着最新式的建築；襯着富於圖案美的日本式的街燈。往來的人力車，汽車，馬車，和一些拖着木屐的人們穿揷在一起；這一切景象使我們覺得恰似置身於大連或東京一般。　　我們蹀　着穿了幾條胡同，在所有的商店橱窗中或咖啡店裏，……凡是所有表現在我們面前的一切形象，眞的，我們實在想不到這是屬於「滿洲國」的「新京」！　　我們想要見識見識正在「建設」中「新京」的「中心區」，忽促地搭上了第一號公共汽車。　　行了沒有一半路，天就在開始落雨了。汽車經過了很多正在修築中的坎坷不平的道路，一直往北拖着，拖着。　　這四年前的荒郊現在亦各處散佈着低矮的樓房，電綫網織滿了天空，這象徵着資本主義的錐子漸漸地打進了東北的內心。　　大約經過了二十里遠近的路程，到達了所謂「中心區」，我冒着雨走下車來。　　正中是一座洋灰築起的圓坪，坪心立若一條圓柱，上面像似嵌着一座銅像，因我們要避免「衛士」們底注意，沒有跑到近前仔細去看。　　四周遍　立着鋼骨，在這陰霾籠罩之下，似一羣枯了的髑髏在低泣；斜吊一起的「千斤」，硬挺挺的姿態，充分顯出了榨取的權威。（未完）</p>

<p>Yusimei: The Pacific Society continued to discuss the issue of world peace and the Nine-Power Treaty yesterday. First, the British representative, Alexander, the former Minister of the Navy of that country, declared that the main key to maintaining world peace lies in the attitude of the United States, in other words, whether the United States is prepared to support collective security in the event of a war panic. Sir Wigram, another British representative, made some remarks on the issue of naval balance, saying that if Japan increases shipbuilding excessively in the future, leading to fierce naval arms competition among countries, Britain should at least maintain the current 5:5:3 ratio. Then, the French representative, Saulo, the former Prime Minister of the country, expressed his views on the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that when the relevant countries jointly signed the treaty, they originally planned to include sanctions clauses so that they could take appropriate action when there were violations of public sentiment, but because former US President Harding insisted on dissenting, it did not become a reality. The reason why this treaty failed to be effective is because of this, but I intend to remedy it, and there is no need to re-establish a new one. It is sufficient to include the sanctions clauses in the current Nine-Power Treaty. The most suspicious thing was the statement by the Soviet representative Motilev, who said that the key to whether the collective security system in the Pacific can be maintained is not on the Soviet side, because the Soviet Union has long had this sincerity. Looking at the various agreements that the country has historically signed with foreign countries, all of them aim to consolidate peace, which is enough to show. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Yusimei: The Pacific Society continued to hold a roundtable meeting this morning. The French representative spoke, believing that the United States was responsible for the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty. The reason for the failure was that the United States refused to implement sanctions to maintain the treaty at the Washington Conference in 1922, but the treaty is still valid and has become a regional treaty, but in order to make it effective, it is necessary to add sanctions clauses to make it a world treaty similar to the League of Nations Covenant. The US representative declared that the United States has now assumed the obligation to negotiate to prevent war. The US participation in the 1935 Argentina Peace Treaty is an example of this. The Japanese representative has changed its attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty. Representatives of all countries believe that if the world degenerates to the state where treaties are equal to waste paper, then the collective security system is impossible. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Yusimei: The Pacific Society continued to hold a roundtable meeting today. The British representative warned that if Japan starts an international shipbuilding competition, Britain will disregard everything and resolutely maintain the current ratio of 5 to 3 between the British and Japanese navies, or even increase it to 2 to 1. Although Britain is unwilling to engage in shipbuilding competition, it only wants to maintain the current state of the navy, but it is also unwilling for Japan to arbitrarily undermine the ratio of 5:5:3 between the British, American, and Japanese navies. The Japanese representative ignored this warning and only paid attention to various issues that directly affected the situation in the Pacific. The Japanese representative declared that Japan is willing to sign a new regional treaty for the Pacific, but it must be conditioned on direct negotiations with China. However, representatives of all countries believe that Japan will insist on maintaining the status quo in the Far East in this treaty, while China will insist on restoring the original state before Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria and Jehol, so they believe that this treaty has no hope of success. The Chinese representative also said that the threat of the Russo-Japanese War must be eliminated first before negotiating this treaty. The Soviet Russian representative said that the current political situation in the Pacific is not conducive to fulfilling the treaty, but Soviet Russia will never hinder the negotiation of this new treaty.

<h3 id="e11">US Naval Officers Ordered to Strictly Maintain Secrecy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Naval officers of the United States were ordered today to strictly maintain military secrets. The motivation for this order was caused by the recent case of Colonel Mu Fu, the son of the former director of the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Navy, who was demoted by a military court for losing a page of confidential documents. The arrest and trial of Howard, a retired US naval officer, for selling military secrets to the Japanese, was also a reason for issuing this order. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Japanese Military Demand Affects Platinum Prices Soar, Reaching an 11-Year High <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Platinum prices have been soaring since this month, and a platinum boom era is about to appear. As of the 1st of this month, the daily price fell to 17 yuan, and it suddenly soared from around the 10th. The price of 19 yuan on the 14th continued to rise, and it reached 29 yuan on the 29th, which is a new record in eleven years since Taisho 15. The reason for its surge is that platinum is a military commodity, and its absolute price is known, and the high price of goods, the decline in currency value, and the restrictions on exports from foreign countries are the main reasons. Therefore, precision machines for military purposes, although expensive, still require huge amounts of platinum, and the amount of platinum reserves has a very important relationship with the victory or defeat of the war. The Platinum Association's sale of patriotic national defense platinum rings is based on this purpose. If the price has been rising so much in recent days that the selling price is difficult to determine, the platinum rings have also disappeared from the market in recent days and are no longer seen in the city.

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Officials and Businessmen Dispute Over the Development of Cotton Industry in North China; Osaka Capitalists Oppose Control <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Cotton industry development is the most important issue in Japan's economic development plan for North China. The dispute between the Japanese government authorities and Osaka capitalists on this issue has become public. Kuwashima, the director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, brought an important proposal to Osaka last week, one of which was to advocate the establishment of a large-scale cotton warehouse company in Tianjin with a capital of 10 million Japanese yen to serve as the center for controlling cotton purchases, and to establish a similar control agency in Osaka. Regarding this proposal, Osaka capitalists all expressed their opposition, strongly advocating a free competition system, and said that the cotton purchase control in Korea and Manchuria has obviously failed. This kind of control not only frustrates merchants' purchases of cotton, but also hinders cotton production. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs jointly discussed countermeasures, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will send a representative to Osaka at the end of September to hold negotiations with local industrialists. In addition, it can be said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to establish a cotton industry research institute in Tianjin and more than ten large-scale agricultural experiment fields in Tianjin, Jinan, and other important cities, with the purpose of increasing the cotton production in North China to 80,000 catties per year.

<p>Education Broadcasting Special: Effective Methods for Preventing and Controlling Rice Stem Borers, Aphids, and Locusts (Part 2)</p>
<p>Wu Fuzhen, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zhejiang University</p>
<p>(C) Locusts</p>
<p>(1) The Life of Locusts</p>
<p>Locusts are also a kind of insect with gradual metamorphosis. Their life has three forms: egg, nymph, and adult. The eggs overwinter in the soil. Usually, dozens to more than one hundred eggs are arranged into an egg mass, which is wrapped with a kind of gelatinous substance for protection. In the coming year, in April and May, when the weather is warm, the eggs hatch into nymphs, crawl out of the soil and eat various plants. After more than a month, after molting five times, they become adult locusts. This is when it is in the summer between June and July, so we call them summer locusts. After the summer locusts mate, they choose a place to lay their eggs. After about two weeks, the eggs hatch into nymphs again, and in August and September they become adult locusts again. This is when it is in the autumn, so we call them autumn locusts. The eggs laid by the autumn locusts overwinter in the soil and do not hatch again during the year: However, if the weather is warm in late autumn, some of the eggs can also hatch in the same year. However, the nymphs hatched this time mostly die before they grow up because the weather is getting colder. Therefore, our country's locusts usually occur in two generations in a year, and sometimes they occasionally become incomplete three generations due to climate reasons.</p>
<p>(2) Effective Prevention and Control Methods for Locusts</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the life of locusts has three stages: egg, nymph, and adult locust. Therefore, the prevention and control methods can also be divided into three stages: removing eggs, removing nymphs, and removing locusts.</p>
<p>(1) Removing eggs - Locust eggs are laid underground, one or two inches deep, with soil around them for protection, so they can overwinter safely. If we dig them out of the soil, they are easily harmed by various natural forces from the outside world and die. Therefore, when locust swarms are found laying eggs in wasteland, we should quickly use deep plowing to turn the egg masses out of the soil, so that they will be dried by the sun, frozen by ice and snow, or pecked to death by various birds; if locusts lay eggs on river banks, embankments, roadsides, etc., where deep plowing cannot be used, a hoe can be used instead, or the egg masses can be dug up with a bell and collected for killing.</p>
<p>(2) Removing nymphs - There are many ways to remove nymphs, and the most effective way is the ditching method. When nymphs migrate, they often move forward bravely in groups. We can dig a deep ditch in front of them and drive them into the ditch to eliminate them in one fell swoop. The length of the ditch can be based on the area of the nymph swarm. The width of the ditch should be based on the nymph age. The older the nymph, the stronger the jumping ability, and the width of the ditch should also be increased accordingly. The commonly used ditch is about three feet deep and wide. The soil dug up in the ditch should be piled on the opposite side of the nymph migration. The ditch wall should be smooth, so that the nymphs cannot easily climb out after falling into the ditch. Every five or six feet in the ditch, another deep pit should be dug, so that the nymphs will gradually fall into the pit after entering the ditch and cannot jump out. After the ditch is dug, the locust hunters will arrange themselves in a row, surround the nymphs, drive them into the ditch, and then bury them with soil.</p>
<p>In the plains and wastelands where ditches cannot be dug, the map striking method can be used. When striking the map, first erect a flag in the center of the nymph area. The nymph strikers each hold a broom made of bamboo shoots or willow branches, arrange themselves in a circle, drive the nymph swarm towards the central flag, and slowly reduce the encirclement. After the nymph swarm is densely gathered in one place, everyone will use the broom to strike hard. Or, before surrounding and striking, dig a deep pit in the center of the nymph area, and then take several reed mats, each clamped with bamboo, so that they can be held in both hands. The nymph strikers each hold a reed mat, surround the nymph swarm, and gradually drive towards the center, causing the nymphs to fall into the pit and bury them with soil.</p>
<p>In places where rivers, traffic, and water sources are convenient, the duck pecking method can be used. Ducks like to eat nymphs very much. Each large duck can eat about two catties of nymphs every day. In June this year, nymphs occurred on Bagua Island in Nanjing. More than 2,000 ducks were used to peck them every day, and they were soon caught. This not only saves labor, but also saves feed, which is really a good way to kill two birds with one stone. However, when releasing ducks, care should be taken not to let the ducks eat too much, and they should often be allowed to rest and drink water, otherwise the ducks may die from bloating.</p>
<p>When nymphs occur beside rivers or lakes, we can use the oil killing method, that is, spray a layer of kerosene on the water surface, and then drive the nymphs into the water. The nymphs will suffocate and die when they are coated with oil. When using this method, if the river water is flowing, bamboo poles or straw ropes should be used to block the river at both ends to prevent the oil from dispersing. Also, use the ditching method. If there is water in the ditch, a little kerosene can also be sprinkled on the water surface to kill the nymphs that fall into the ditch.</p>
<p>(3) Removing locusts - Because adult locusts have four wings and can fly high and far, they are most difficult to catch and control. The only method is to catch them in the early morning or evening. Because the locusts are least active at this time and are easiest to catch. If there are a large number of locusts, they can be captured and killed with insect nets.</p>
<p>The methods described above are simple and easy to implement, but locust damage is like bandits. If Party A catches and strikes, they will escape to Party B. If Party B catches and strikes, they will escape to Party C. Therefore, all areas where locusts occur must work together with one heart and one mind, regardless of boundaries, to capture and eliminate them together in order to eliminate them. And there must be a strict organization, that is, counties, districts, townships, and villages must have locust control groups to supervise in turn; and then formulate reward and punishment methods, reward those who are diligent, and punish those who are lazy. For the superstition that locusts are divine insects, they should be earnestly informed and try their best to eliminate them, so that the locust problem in various places can be easily solved.

<p>Mussolini will visit Hitler in Germany next month.</p>
<p>Austrian Prime Minister Denies Participation in Central European Group.</p>
<p>German Minister of Propaganda Flies to Italy.</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Berlin news, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will go to Hitler's Berchtesgaden villa in Germany in late September to meet with German leader Hitler, to thank him for his trip to Venice in 1933. It is reported that Mussolini will also take the opportunity to express Italy's gratitude to Germany for not participating in the sanctions. Some observers now believe that Germany and Italy may unite to resist Bolshevism in Central Europe. It is reported that an agreement is currently being considered, which, if implemented, will include Germany, Italy, Austria, and Bulgaria. (29th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Some foreign political circles here have recently widely rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Germany next month to meet with leader Hitler, and said that Hungarian Regent Horthy recently discussed this matter with Hitler at Berchtesgaden. It is said that the Italian Prime Minister will land by plane at Berchtesgaden, where Hitler's villa is located. It is especially appropriate for the leaders of the two countries to meet here. It is said that the intention of this visit by the Italian Prime Minister is twofold: one is that Hitler visited Venice, Italy in 1933, and this time he is here for a return visit; and the other is that when various countries implemented sanctions against Italy, Germany's attitude was beneficial to Italy, and he is here to express his gratitude. In short, the political significance of this meeting is extremely important. According to some observers, Germany and Italy are determined to form a Central European group, with an agreement between Germany, Italy, Austria, Poland, and Bulgaria, and possibly including Bulgaria, to resist Bolshevism. The event that promoted the evolution of this policy is the Spanish Incident. (28th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the statement that Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Germany to meet with the country's leader Hitler, political circles here recently declared that when various countries previously implemented sanctions against Italy, only Germany's attitude was different from that of other countries, which is what Italy deeply appreciates. In addition, leader Hitler visited Italy in June 1934, and it is appropriate to return the visit. Based on these two points, Mussolini has the intention to visit Germany in person. However, as of now, no negotiations have been conducted on this trip, because Italy has always opposed the creation of two groups of countries in Europe. That is, Central European countries, for the sake of anti-communism, constitute a certain understanding, which should also be considered when the threat of Bolshevism is imminent. As for the relationship between Italy and Germany, although extremely friendly, at this time, Italy's policy has not been completely integrated with Germany's policy. Furthermore, German business people originally had high hopes for the Italian market, thinking that they could control it, but when they saw that after the sanctions were lifted, Italy signed business agreements with other countries one after another, the original wish was shattered, and they were greatly disappointed. This is also a small setback in the sound of the rapprochement between Germany and Italy. (29th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels flew to Nice, Italy this morning. It is said that the purpose of this trip is to prepare for the meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler in Berchtesgaden at the end of September. This rumor has aroused speculation that Germany and Italy are trying to establish an anti-radical alliance in Europe, but officials have denied any preparations for any meetings. (29th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Venice, Italy holds an exhibition every two years, and now is the time for the meeting. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels has decided to fly to visit tomorrow, and plans to visit Italian Minister of Propaganda Alfieri by the way. (28th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>(Vienna) There are rumors that Germany, Italy, and other countries will form a Central European group, and Austria will also participate in it. Prime Minister Schuschnigg recently denied this statement, saying that Austria's foreign policy is still based on the Rome Agreement signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary. (29th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>Romania's Cabinet</p>
<p>Curbing Fascist Party</p>
<p>Prime Minister Uses Resignation to Fight</p>
<p>Capital of Romania:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tatarescu submitted the general resignation of the cabinet to King Carol today, but the King ordered him to organize a new government. It is said that the resignation of the cabinet was the result of Tatarescu's efforts to curb the illegal "Iron Guard" organization. According to the group, it was temporarily disbanded in 1933 due to the assassination of former Prime Minister Duca. Now the group continues to exist under the patriotic name of "Completely for the Country," and there are recent rumors that it will resume large-scale activities. Therefore, it declares that it will be dealt with severely. (29th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania:</p>
<p>The cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting today. According to political figures, the cabinet may be reorganized after the cabinet meeting is adjourned. The green right-wing parties have been extremely active recently, and the "Iron Guard" with national socialist tendencies is the most active. The members of the group have always been involved in assassinations, such as former Prime Minister Duca, who was killed in December 1933, and the leader of the group's branch, Stellerko, who was assassinated in the early spring of 1934. Recently, they have threatened the leaders of the Farmers' Union, Lubu and Secretary Magaro, saying that if they plot against the group, they will be put to death. The reason for the reorganization of the cabinet is that strict measures must be taken to curb the activities of the group. It is said that Minister of the Interior Ingulescu has always been passive towards right-wing activities. If the cabinet is reorganized, this position will definitely be replaced.

(29th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>Lisbon:</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War has been going on for six weeks. Currently, both sides are making advances and retreats, and the news is extremely chaotic. An Associated Press reporter telegraphed today that a rebel column of 10,000 people is now reinforcing Chailagochai to resist the offensive of the Catalonia army. The defenses of the government army in the Guadarrama Mountains are now very solid. The rebels in the north have lost the opportunity to seize Madrid. (29th National Electric)</p>
<p>Andai:</p>
<p>According to a famous foreigner who arrived here by plane from Madrid today, the Spanish are accustomed to hating humidity and fearing cold, which may stop their civil war in the autumn rain. A Reuters interviewer telegraphed, "If the strategy I witnessed on the hillside facing Belgium and controlling the city of Irun last week continues unchanged, then it does not seem unreasonable to say that this tragedy should end here for a long time. British expatriates from Madrid all believe that if the war is delayed for another week, Spain will need another year to recover its social and economic losses. However, after talking with various refugees, I feel that the sacrifices of Spain in blood and property will not be as great as imagined. Many people who were initially thought to have died will be found to be safe and sound. No insurance company will go bankrupt due to compensation," and so on. (29th Reuters Electric)</p>

It did not completely stop until 3:00 this morning. The sound of gunfire did not stop until dawn. The government army is still guarding the key points around the church. The rebel attack was obviously unsuccessful. The war completely stopped at 9:00 this morning. It is believed that the rebels have obtained artillery reinforcements and are now preparing to bombard the border area. The rebels have sacrificed too much to capture Irun, so they plan to bombard the city to force it to surrender. (29th Reuters Electric)</p>

According to various deserters, they were lured by their superiors to come here to fight, but in fact, they all wished to join the official army to fight. (29th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>Biliyadou:</p>
<p>The artillery team of the Spanish Revolutionary Army is currently bombarding the city of Irun, and the official army is also firing back from the top of Mount Bien Tai. The fortifications built there are very solid, and the official army is also resisting strongly. Therefore, the revolutionary army obviously cannot advance and plans to encircle the positions occupied by the official army from both wings. However, it is still unknown whether this strategy will be effective. The border between France and Spain here has been sealed off, and pedestrians are not allowed to pass through. However, after many attempts, a special commissioner of this agency was able to cross the border this afternoon to inspect the battlefield near the village of Santa Maria near the city of Irun and visit the commander of the official army there. There are often revolutionary army planes coming to scout in the city of Irun, so the sound of planes in the air echoes with the siren and bell that warn the public on the ground. The village of Voyesen, south of Sangsi-Yessian, has been occupied by the revolutionary army for a long time. It is reported that the official army once bombarded the village and forced the revolutionary army to abandon it. (28th Havas Electric)</p>

<p>Andai:</p>
<p>The war in the town of Irun in northeastern Spain is still continuing this month. Both sides mostly use artillery and machine guns to attack each other. Until the evening, fierce fighting broke out around the church of San Marsiar on a mountain peak overlooking the city. The official army has artillery units stationed on the mountain peak. Several rebel planes began to attack and destroyed the path leading to the church, and then advanced. Therefore, both sides used hand grenades and bombs to fight each other. The Moroccan and guest armies tried to rush to the mountain peak from the south, but the official army bombarded them with machine guns. Although the attacking army fell one after another, it repeatedly decided to attack and was eventually repelled. By dusk, the rebels abandoned the strategy of capturing the mountain peak and began to bombard the city of Irun. A shell fell in the garden of a villa in Andai, France, but it did not explode. It is reported that the French government will demand the establishment of a neutral zone to ensure the safety of the French border. Tonight, the rebels attacked the Irun front again. It is not yet known whether the official army is still firmly defending its position. However, at the time of sending the telegram, the sound of artillery fire from the official army's artillery team was still rumbling. A group of guest soldiers in the rebel army fled into France. It is said that in their team of 135 people, only 25 survived the attack on the church of San Marsiar. The rest were either dead or injured. (28th Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>(London) British Labor MPs. The General Council of the Labor Union and the National Executive Committee of the Labor Party, after holding a joint meeting in London, issued a declaration today, expressing their support for the principle of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, but regarding the prohibition of transporting military supplies to Spain, the effect of this will make the democratically elected and internationally recognized government of Spain and the rebels suffer the same impact, which is unavoidable. The declaration also strongly stated the importance of all parties immediately implementing and faithfully adhering to the non-interference agreement. Finally, it appealed to workers in various parts of the United Kingdom to generously donate to international fundraising for humanitarian assistance to the Spanish people. (28th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(London) The Labor Parliamentary Party and the National Executive Committee of the party, as well as the Executive Committee of the General Federation of Labor Unions, recently published a joint declaration in various newspapers, which briefly stated, "According to international law, the current government of Spain is a legitimate government and has the right to purchase military weapons for self-defense. On the contrary, anyone who provides military weapons to the rebels in the country is obviously violating international law. Now, fascist Italy, ignoring disapproval, is supplying military weapons to the rebels in Spain. Observing the process, it is enough to prove that Italy has long been aware of the Spanish rebellion plan. From this point of view, Italy has actually brewed an imminent war, and the danger is obvious. In addition, fascist Portugal is also assisting the Spanish rebels and using Portuguese territory as a base for the rebels to fight, which is extremely hateful. Furthermore, because the situation in Spain is enough to cause war, various European countries have decided to form an agreement to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to Spain, which is tantamount to treating the government and the rebels as the same. We cannot help but regret it. The fascist countries are now becoming more and more rampant and aggressive, and the danger is extremely serious. All major democratic countries should not turn a blind eye to it," and so on. (28th Havas Electric)</p>

<p>Spanish Diplomatic Representatives in China Declare Support for the Current Government; Oppose Pro-Rebel Stance of Diplomatic Personnel in Japan.</p>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily News", due to the Spanish Ambassador in Tokyo and his staff declaring allegiance to the rebel forces in their home country, reporters visited Mr. Laracoa, the Spanish Vice-Consul in Shanghai, to inquire about his stance. Mr. Laracoa stated that he remained loyal to the Madrid government and considered himself a good citizen of Spain, believing that all good Spanish citizens should be loyal to the government. He expressed disagreement with the actions of his colleagues in Tokyo, stating that the Spanish Ambassador in Tokyo, Mr. Daivigo, and other Spanish diplomats resigned because they were royalists and aristocrats. Their ability to hold positions under the Republican government was only due to the government's tolerance. The rebel forces led by General Franco aim to overthrow the democratically elected Republican government and spread false rumors that the Republican regime is controlled by communists and socialists to confuse the public. Despite this propaganda, the majority of the Spanish people still support the government. He believes that the government will ultimately prevail in the current conflict, as it controls the most productive and industrialized provinces, such as Bilbao, Valencia, and Barcelona, placing it in a superior position and assuring victory. According to news from Peiping, Mr. Cisneros, the Spanish Minister to China, also declared his continued obedience to the Madrid government, stating that as a diplomat, he is not concerned with domestic political changes.</p>

<p>Serious Labor Unrest at Three British and American Factories; Factory Management Plans to Recruit New Workers; Workers Discuss Response.</p>
<p>According to the "Ta Kung News Agency," since the British-American Tobacco Company's Third Factory (now renamed Gu Zhong Tobacco Company) on Huade Road, Pudong Road, hired Wei Ziqian as its Chinese manager, various measures regarding the treatment of workers have caused dissatisfaction among the factory workers, leading to brewing disputes. Recently, the manager dismissed a female worker named Ah Wu without cause and refused to grant workers leave, which triggered a general work slowdown. Although the British supervisor, Mr. Hubruck, advised against it, the workers demanded the removal of Manager Wei as a prerequisite, making it difficult to reconcile the two sides. As a result, the labor unrest is gradually becoming more serious. The factory is now preparing to recruit new workers, making the resolution of the dispute unpredictable.</p>
<p>Factory Announcement:</p>
<p>The factory posted a Chinese-English announcement at the factory gate yesterday morning, stating that the workers' strike had occurred without cause and had not yet resumed. If all workers resume work immediately, the matters of concern will be discussed again. The workers' wages for August can be claimed at the factory on the 31st. However, wages will not be paid for the period of the slowdown. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Workers' Meetings:</p>
<p>The workers panicked upon hearing that the factory was going to recruit new workers. They held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, attended by more than 60 representatives from various departments, including Leaf, Packing, Tobacco Silk, Tin Packing, Cigarettes, and Can departments, to discuss how to respond. They unanimously agreed on eight demands to present to the factory management and have requested assistance from party and government agencies.</p>
<p>Demands:</p>
<p>The full list of demands of all the workers at the factory is as follows: (1) Leave requests should not require Manager Wei Ziqian's approval and should be handled by each department as before; (2) Workers should not be written up for the three-day slowdown; (3) Demerit records should be cleared after one year; (4) Workers should not be dismissed or removed under the pretext of the slowdown; (5) Regular wage increases should not be suspended due to ordinary faults; (6) Workers who are dismissed or given demerits should be allowed to appeal and should not be executed arbitrarily; (7) Workers should not be transferred arbitrarily; (8) Wages should be paid as usual for the duration of the slowdown.</p>

After interrogation, all cases have been transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for strict handling according to law. Opium offenders without licenses are sent to the Longhua Detoxification Center for examination.

<p>Additional Labor Unrest News: Party and Government Mediation in the Meiya Labor Dispute.</p>
<p>The strike at the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory Second Plant at 169 Jiaotong Road in Zhabei has lasted for five days. The two sides are deadlocked over the issue of the ranking system, so work has not resumed.

However, as the workers had not put forward a formal representative, no progress could be made. They returned to their respective departments for instructions and will handle the matter again. It is possible that all workers will be instructed to resume work first, and then discuss the issues of concern.</p>

<p>Details of Telegram Price Reduction.</p>
<p>Regarding the price reduction for telegrams within the province and changes in the calculation method for names and addresses in Chinese telegrams starting from September 1st, details have been reported in previous newspapers. However, there are some unclear points. Here are further details: (1) The price reduction for telegrams within the province is calculated at approximately 70% of the price of telegrams sent out of the province, i.e., (1) Chinese plain language is reduced to 7 cents per character, (2) Chinese code language or foreign language is reduced to 14 cents per character, (3) Urgent telegrams are calculated at double the above rates, (4) Official telegrams are reduced to 3.5 cents per character, (5) Chinese news telegrams are reduced to fractions of a cent per character (English 4 cents per character), (6) The price of social telegrams is already low, so it remains the same as telegrams sent out of the province, at 2 cents per Chinese character and 4 cents per English character. (2) Changes in the calculation method for names and addresses in Chinese telegrams: Recognizing that Chinese addresses cannot be fully expressed with a few characters, the Ministry of Communications implemented a method on January 1, 1934, in which names and addresses within 15 characters were counted as 5 characters. For the past two years, the public has known that there is a cheaper way to send telegrams. However, the calculation often does not match the calculation at the telegraph office. Starting from September 1st, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated a new, simple method for Chinese telegrams, excluding registered telegrams, which will still be calculated using the old method. Names and addresses will be calculated by counting two characters as one. For example, "Nanjing Central University," which has six characters, will be counted as three characters. At the same time, it is stipulated that if the total number of characters is less than two, it will still be counted as one character. If there are seven characters, it will be counted as four characters. As the calculation method is simple, the public will find it more convenient. According to the telegraph office's statistics, the majority of recipients' names and addresses in Chinese telegrams do not exceed ten characters. Therefore, in practice, the cost of telegrams is cheaper than the previous method of counting 15 characters as 5 characters. The new method stipulates that house numbers, lane numbers, etc., can still be written in Arabic numerals and placed in parentheses. When they do not exceed four digits (five digits in code telegrams), they can be counted as one character. For example, "Shanghai Xiafei Road (575) Lane (63) Zhang," will be counted as ten characters, and the fee will be for five characters. Furthermore, the recipient's "title" or "position" can be included in the recipient's name and enjoy the right of counting two characters as one character, such as "Mr.," "Brother," "Director," "Manager," etc. However, set phrases such as "Xunjian" or "Jian" should still be treated as the text of the telegram and charged per character.</p>
<p>Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant to Transmit Electricity to Liuhe; Agreement Negotiations to Be Completed Soon, Construction to Begin; Power Supply Expected to Open in Mid-October.</p>
<p>Since June 1st of this year, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant has been responsible for transmitting electricity to all towns in the Zhabei vicinity of Baoshan County, and the Dachang Dayue Electric Light Factory has been responsible for distribution. Since its implementation, the people have praised the convenience due to the ample power supply and the ability to generate electricity day and night. Jiading County has also been directly supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant since the first day of May. According to Manager Wang of the Dayao Electric Light Factory, since the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant has been supplying electricity to the two counties of Jiading and Lan, the people of the two counties have favored the low electricity prices and the abundant light. In order to expand electricity supply to other nearby towns, there are plans to transmit electricity to Liuhe, a key commercial district with many residents. If the connection is made, the market will become even more prosperous. It is estimated that the project will cost more than 10,000 yuan. Electricity poles will be erected along Hutai Road from Luodian. The project has been negotiated and is ready to begin construction. It is expected to be completed in October.</p>
<p>Two Dangerous Submerged Reefs Discovered Near Xiangshan Port; Qingtian Reef Shoal Expands; Ships Must Proceed with Caution.</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Department of the Ministry of the Navy issued a notice stating: Two dangerous submerged reefs have been discovered near Niupi Mountain Channel, Xiangshan Port, on the east coast of China.

<p>The Unique Features of the Chinese Seamen's Club; Unprecedented in Our Country, Ushering in a New Era for the World.</p>
<p>Chinese seamen, meaning those who serve on ships, number over 800,000 and are organized worldwide. Therefore, there is a Seamen's Party Department and a Seamen's Union at the central level to promote the welfare of seamen. The recently organized "Chinese Seamen's Club" is grand in scale and comprehensive in its internal organization. Its unique features include: (1) The rights and interests of the Club are not limited to party members and union members among the seamen. All Chinese seamen can enjoy them equally anytime and anywhere. (2) Seamen from various regions are not limited by geographical area. For example, seamen belonging to Shanghai can participate in the Hankou Seamen's Club at any time when they arrive in Hankou. Similarly, seamen belonging to Wuhu can participate in the Guangzhou Seamen's Club at any time when they arrive in Guangzhou by ship. (3) Seamen spend their lives sailing the seas and consider the world their home, which is a hard life. As the Seamen's Club gradually expands and becomes available everywhere, its internal organization becomes extremely comprehensive, including seamen's apartments, hospitals, various cooperatives, nurseries, and sports, education, entertainment, and recreational facilities. Everything is available, allowing all seamen to join the Club anytime and anywhere, as if returning to their families, transforming the hardship of considering the world their home into the joy of having a home everywhere. China has never had such an organization in the past. Even countries with long-standing seamen's organizations around the world do not have such a grand organization. The Chinese Seamen's Club is currently being organized within the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen on Zhaojia Road in the Old West Gate and will be officially established on September 1st.</p>
<p>Sanxing Wheel Collides with Shengan Wheel in Dagu, Tianjin; Sanxing Responsible.</p>
<p>The Shengan Wheel of the Shengan Company was docked at the Kai Wharf in Dagu, Tianjin, loading cargo. The Sanxing Wheel of the Sanxing Company was sailing out of Tianjin and had already passed in front of the Shengan Wheel when the Yingli Wheel entered the port. In front of the customs water pipe at that location, it encountered a large sailboat sailing across the waterway. The Yingli Wheel had to drop anchor and give way. At this time, the wind was strong and the tide was high, causing the Sanxing Wheel to be pressed back and unable to stop, resulting in a collision with the starboard side of the Shengan Wheel. Sanxing will be responsible for the damage to the Shengan and will pay for the repair costs.</p>
<p>Voyagers on the Shanghai-Yangzhou Shipping Line Frequently Disturbed by Vagrants; Dada and Datong Shipping Companies Request Suppression from the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Voyagers on the Shanghai-Yangzhou shipping line operated by the Dada Shipping Company and the Datong Shipping Company are frequently disturbed by vendors and vagrants who swarm aboard at various ports of call.</p>
<p>They Disrupt Passenger Cabins.</p>
<p>The companies have submitted a petition to the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting suppression of these disturbances. The petition states: Our company operates the Shanghai-Yangzhou shipping line within Jiangsu Province, facilitating transportation between the north and south of the Yangtze River. All measures are taken with the aim of benefiting travelers. Therefore, we strive to improve the management of ships and ports. However, at various ports, vendors and vagrants often swarm aboard to solicit customers and create disturbances in the passenger cabins.</p>
<p>Disorderly and Disruptive.</p>
<p>Legitimate passengers are not only squeezed and jostled but are also often subjected to fraud. If this bad habit is not eliminated, it is inevitable that villains will infiltrate and plot wrongdoing, posing a major threat to maritime safety. Although company employees have made every effort to dissuade them, the actual effect is minimal. Therefore, we petition the Governor to order the naval and military police authorities of Nantong, Rugao, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Taixing, Yangzhou, Jiangdu, and other counties along the Shanghai-Yangzhou shipping line to</p>
<p>Strictly Suppress</p>
<p>these vendors and vagrants and prohibit them from boarding the ships. We also request that the Governor's Office issue forty copies of notices for distribution to each ship and port to facilitate management and ensure safety.</p>

<p>My Country's Athletes Accompanying the Expedition (11th Letter) by Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</p>
<p>Long Jump Jumps Over Eight Meters</p>
<p>A total of 51 athletes from various countries participated in the long jump. Trial competitions were held in two groups at 10:30 AM. It was stipulated that a score of 7.15 meters was required to participate in the preliminary round in the afternoon. Our country's athletes Hao Chunde and Situ Guang were in the first group, and Zhang Jiakui was in the second group. The strength of all three was below 7 meters, and there was no hope of participating in the preliminary round. This was expected. The preliminary round was held at 4:30 PM, with each person jumping three times. The best six results were as follows:</p>
<p>Owens (USA) 7.87 meters</p>
<p>Long (Germany) 7.84 meters</p>
<p>Tajima Naoto (Japan) 7.74 meters</p>
<p>Murphy (Italy) 7.73 meters</p>
<p>Clark (USA) 7.60 meters</p>
<p>Leichum (Germany) 7.52 meters</p>
<p>After the jump, the final was held at the sand pit in front of the podium. Each person also jumped three times. Leichum jumped first. There was no progress in the first two jumps. The third jump was 7.73 meters, surpassing Clark. The second jump was 7.67 meters, which was an improvement over the preliminary round, but it was useless and he was relegated to sixth. Murphy's three jumps all saw a decline. Tajima's first two jumps were unsuccessful, and the third jump was out of bounds. Long's first jump was mediocre, and the second jump was 7.87 meters, tied with Owens for the top spot. After the third jump, he could not jump up due to uneven force. Owens exceeded 8 meters in the first jump in the final, but it was out of bounds, and the whole field sighed. In the second jump, because Long's score had been tied with him, he jumped up and got 7.94 meters, again in the lead. In the last jump, he was already firmly in the top spot and tried to break the record. When starting the run, he used all his energy, sprinted with his flying speed, and stepped on the board just right. The elasticity was unusually sufficient, and the score was 8.06 meters, breaking the world record that had been held for five years. (The old record was 7.98 meters set by Nanbu of Japan in 1931. The tournament record was 7.73 meters set by Hamm of the United States in 1928.) After Owens finished jumping, he made another informal trial jump, and the result was even more progressive than his last jump in the final, but it was out of bounds and not measured.</p>
<p>(1) Owens (USA) 8.06 meters</p>
<p>(2) Long (Germany) 7.87 meters</p>
<p>(3) Tajima Naoto (Japan) 7.74 meters</p>
<p>(4) Murphy (Italy) 7.73 meters</p>
<p>(5) Leichum (Germany) 7.73 meters</p>
<p>(6) Clark (USA) 7.67 meters</p>
<p>The results of Owens' six jumps are recorded again:</p>
<p>(1) 7.74</p>
<p>(2) 7.87</p>
<p>(3) 7.75</p>
<p>(4) Out of bounds</p>
<p>(5) 7.94</p>
<p>(6) 8.06</p>
<p>New Record for Women's Discus Throw</p>
<p>The women's discus final was held at 3:15 PM. A total of 21 people participated. Each person threw three times. The best six people were taken for the final, and each person threw three more times. The Polish woman Wascuna was the 14th person to throw. Among the mediocre results of the people who had already thrown, the first throw was 44.69, breaking the tournament record first. The 19th thrower was the German athlete Meyer. She was tall and thin, and her rotation speed was very fast. The posture was exceptionally beautiful. The discus flew out of thin air and far exceeded the mark of the tournament record, scoring an excellent score of 47.63 meters. She won the top spot with this throw. There was no progress in the next five throws. Wascuna advanced to 46.22 meters in the second throw. The next four throws also only saw a decline. The other scoring personnel were far apart, and none of them exceeded 40 meters. According to Meyer, she is the world record holder with a score of 48.31 meters, which was made in June of this year and has not yet been officially recognized. The tournament record is 40.56 meters set by Ms. Copeland of the United States in 1932.</p>
<p>(1) Meyer (Germany) 47.63</p>
<p>(2) Wascuna (Poland) 46.22</p>
<p>(3) Moleinhoer (Germany) 39.80</p>
<p>(4) Nakamura (Japan) 38.24</p>
<p>(5) Minoshima (Japan) 37.35</p>
<p>(6) Landert (Sweden) 35.92</p>
<p>Rom (Classic)</p>
<p>200-meter Preliminary Round</p>
<p>The 200-meter preliminary round was held at 10:30 AM. There were eight groups. Except for the fourth and fifth groups with five people, and the seventh group with four people, the rest had six people. Famous players such as Metcalf Wecoff of the United States, Ze Schumer of Germany, and Yoshioka Takade of Japan did not participate. As a result, Owens of the first group broke the tournament record with a score of 21.1 seconds. Parker of the seventh group equaled the tournament record with 21.2 seconds. (The tournament record was created by Turen of the United States in 1932). Cheng Jinguan of our country participated in the fourth group. In the first dozens of meters, he was able to barely follow. After that, he gradually became unsustainable and finished the race in last place, about ten meters away from the first place. Chuan Jincheng participated in the fifth group and fought hard. Although he was also more than ten meters away from the first place, he was only one step away from the third place. Liu Changchun participated in the sixth group. At 160 meters, he was still in fourth place, but later he was exhausted and retreated to fifth. The distance below the third place was about one shoulder. It is a pity that Chuan and Liu failed to win the next round.</p>

<p>The second round was held at 3:30 PM, divided into four groups, with six people participating in each group, taking the top three. The competition in the first group was the most intense. The Swiss player Heini led the way, and at 180 meters, the Canadian player Ol fought out and won the top spot by one shoulder with a score of 21.2 seconds, equaling the tournament record. The second and third places were also very close. In the second group, the Dutch player Beverlen was strong and dropped the second place by about one step. In the third group, Owens showed his heroic posture again, still breaking the tournament record with a score of 21.1 seconds, dropping the second place by about seven or eight meters. Robinson, the winner of the fourth group, was also black, rushing out of the crowd in the last 30 meters and winning the top spot by one shoulder with a score equal to the tournament record. It is predicted that the 200-meter final will be the same as the 100-meter final, becoming the world of black.</p>

<p>Securities: Longs Calm, Bond Market Remains Stable - All Various Bonds Down by 0.05 to 0.35 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the market remain extremely stable. The environment reversed to become severe, but the market price did not rise or fall. The market was extremely nervous at the beginning of the opening, and there seemed to be the possibility of a sharp decline. After the opening, No. 93 first bought, and the monthly E bond was raised, preventing a large decline. The market price stabilized at this point. A bonds slightly dropped by 0.5 yuan, and the second round immediately went back up. D bonds actually rose by as much as 0.45 yuan. The two rounds in the afternoon completely trended towards fluctuation, with ups and downs of only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, and trading was also extremely quiet. As a result, the market price also slightly dropped by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. E bonds were still good at</p>

<p>(1) Catfish Boat: Named for its narrow, elongated shape resembling a loach, it has four oars and four sculls, specializing in carrying salt. It can carry up to thirty *zhang* of salt (*zhang* being 10,000 *jin*, or about 11,023 pounds), totaling over 300,000 *jin*, or more often 280,000 *jin*. The crew ranges from twenty or thirty to fifty or sixty, sometimes even around a hundred people. It can travel upstream to Luzhou, and downstream to Shashi in Hubei. The ship's workers include a "head worker," commonly called "Taigong," who manages all ship affairs and directs the crew. One to four "hit-the-boom" workers (also known as *ban shao*) assist Taigong in various tasks. There is also one *waizhangguan* (outside manager) who manages the cabin, usually taken up by the boat owner or a junior owner. One person manages the *zhang tian gao* (sky pole), meaning the mast and awning (i.e., sail). There is also one person to "collect the bamboo mat," who is in charge of reeling in and letting out the tow rope when pulling upstream. There is also one helmsman. One or two "helmsman assistants" do odd jobs, and there are two cooks (commonly called *shao huo lao*). The tow workers have a "foreman" who oversees all the towmen. In addition to dozens of towmen, there is also a "water-searching pipe," a person who must be proficient in swimming and is ready to go into the water at any time to untangle the tow rope, preventing it from getting caught in the cracks of the riverbed rocks, or swimming into the swift currents and deep waters to retrieve it if it breaks and falls into the water. There is also a "reed-gathering" person who is solely responsible for land-based tasks. Neither of these two tow the boat; they only follow the main group in case of emergency. This is because the river's current is torrential, and going upstream requires pulling the tow rope around the shoals (meaning to travel in a winding, circling path). After the introduction of wheeled transport, these large cargo ships have become rare.</p>
<p>(2) Sparrowtail Boat: The tail is like that of a sparrow, and the belly is especially large, also used as a salt transport boat. The large ones carry over 200,000 *jin*, and the small ones carry over 100,000 *jin*. It also has four oars and four sculls. The crew ranges from dozens to hundreds of people. Its characteristic is a wide bow and a deep hull, mostly traveling between Chongqing and Yichang. The ship's organization is roughly the same as the Catfish Boat.</p>
<p>(3) Crow Autumn Boat: The bow is narrow, the belly is wide, and the shape is long and narrow. It has a shallow draft but carries a lot of weight, holding 10,000 to 110,000 *jin*. The crew ranges from thirty to sixty or seventy people. The main cargo is coal, salt, and grain, traveling between the Fujiang River, Chongqing, and Hechuan.</p>
<p>(4) Rudder Cage Boat: Named for the cage-like structure at the stern that protects the rudder. It carries 30,000 to 120,000 *jin*. The crew ranges from a dozen to thirty people. It travels between Wanxian and Chongqing, carrying all kinds of cargo.</p>
<p>(5) Anyue Boat: Shaped like the "Crow Autumn Boat," but the awning at the stern is about two feet shorter. It carries 30,000 to 70,000 *jin*. It transports coal, grain, and other goods, traveling between the Fujiang River, Chongqing, and Hechuan. The crew is about twenty people.</p>
<p>The above types of boats once held authority in the Sichuan rivers, but now they are gradually decreasing, and the goods they carry are not as plentiful as in the past. The following types are more common now:</p>
<p>(6) Half-Head Boat: The large ones can carry 200,000 to 300,000 *jin*. It travels between Wanxian and upstream Luzhou. The crew is at most seven or eight people.</p>
<p>(7) Bamboo Raft: Travels from Luzhou, Baisha to Chongqing. It is made of large moso bamboo, like a log raft. It can also carry thousands of *jin*. There are also many in the Tonghe River of Leshan (i.e., Jiading). The crew is only a dozen people, and the towmen are mostly temporary short-term workers.</p>
<p>(8) Lighter: Also known as a small five-plank boat, it carries only a few thousand *jin*. It transports salt from Dengjingguan, the salt-producing area of Fushun Zigong, to Luzhou, where it is then loaded onto larger Catfish Boats. Because of the convenience of travel, small amounts can accumulate into large amounts, so hundreds of these boats line the docks day and night.</p>
<p>(9) Large Five-Plank Boat: When the water rises, the large five-plank boat is often used to transport salt. Its shape is slightly similar to the small five-plank boat, but it carries more weight, from at least six or seven thousand *jin* to as much as forty or fifty thousand *jin*. The crew also ranges from at least a dozen to as many as thirty people.</p>
<p>(10) Spirit Strip Boat: Named for its narrow and elongated shape. It travels from Chenzhou River in Hunan to the Sichuan River, mainly carrying dry goods. When in Dongting Lake and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, it hoists the sail to its full extent, traveling very quickly. It can carry about 100,000 *jin*. The staffing on the ship is slightly different from the Sichuan river boats, and there are also many taboos.</p>
<p>(11) Open-Mouth Mayang Boat: Named for its particularly wide cabin, it specializes in carrying goods and salt, carrying over 100,000 *jin*. The crew ranges from a dozen to thirty or forty people. It travels between northern Hunan and eastern Sichuan.</p>
<p>(12) Mayang Boat: Also comes from the Chenzhou River in Hunan, but does not carry cargo. It is dedicated to transporting officials (i.e., government officials and office staff) and luggage trunks. It has the shallowest draft, carrying only four or five thousand to ten thousand *jin*. The crew is at most only a dozen people. It departs in the morning and docks in the evening, not sailing at night (the Sichuan River has always been like this, but cargo ships can sometimes travel until dusk, while passenger ships dock earlier).</p>
<p>(13) *Guazi* Boat: There are large and small sizes: the four-cabin, windowed, large *guazi* boat is the most spacious; the next is the three-cabin and four-cabin. It is also a boat dedicated to carrying official passengers, with a very shallow draft. The crew is a dozen people. It carries a few thousand to ten thousand *jin*. The exterior is generous, like the "outer coat" worn in the Qing Dynasty, hence the name. It travels faster than cargo ships. If there are urgent official missions with little luggage, a small *guazi* boat can be used to make time. Torches and lanterns illuminate like daylight. However, in extremely dangerous shoals, it will stop before and after the shoals, selecting a place to dock, and only be able to navigate the shoals after dawn the next day.</p>
<p>(14) Sculling Boat: Exclusively uses sculls to row. When rowing, dozens of boatmen step and chant, called *naoge* (Sichuan people often call boatmen "*nao fuzi*," like calling sedan carriers "*jiao fuzi*"). This boat goes from Xiaojiangkou out of Kai County's Xiaojiang River to Wanxian and Kuizhou (i.e., Baxian). It carries about five or six thousand *jin*. It does not use silk cables much.</p>
<p>(15) Spirit Lighter: It loads salt from the Yunyang factory and follows the Jialing River to the Yangtze River to Wanxian. It carries five or six thousand *jin*, travels extremely fast, and is shaped like a Spirit Strip Boat but even narrower. Superstition on the ship is also deep. For example, bowls cannot be overturned; chopsticks must be called "hao gan," and the word "overturn" must be said as "turn," and so on. The taboos are extremely serious.</p>
<p>(16) Cucumber Boat: Its shape is like half a cucumber, also known as a Ba River boat, traveling from the Ba River out of Hechuan to Chongqing. It can load about 10,000 *jin* of cargo. The crew is dozens of people. There are two oars and two sculls each. It also pulls the tow rope when going upstream.</p>
<p>(17) Crooked-Butt Boat: Also called Fuzhou boat, it sails in the Gongtan River of Fuzhou, ending in Fuzhou. It can carry five or six thousand *jin*. The boat shape is very special, the front half is like a Spirit Lighter, but the stern is skewed, and the rudder tower is crooked. The crew is a dozen people, and the tow rope is only used when the water is shallow.</p>
<p>(18) Red Boat: Dedicated to saving lives in the river. The boat is like a Catfish Boat but smaller, as light and fast as flying. More than a dozen wooden oars are rowed together, covering several *li* in an instant. When the water is high, it can sail through any shoal, making travel convenient. Both government and private entities have them. The larger ones can also carry thousands of *jin*. The crew on board has better swimming skills than other boatmen, in order to save the lives of passengers on accident ships. Currently, where ferries can pass, almost all are equipped with small rescue motorboats, and this type of red boat is gradually being eliminated.</p>
<p>In the Sichuan River, whenever the water is high, *mu* boats and steamships are equally stable. If the water is low, the currents are naturally turbulent and dangerous. Underwater reefs rise and fall, making navigation difficult. Sometimes steamships dare not go. Recently, the Minsheng Shipping Company, in order to ensure the safety of travelers, bombed several dangerous shoals, so currently there are fewer accidents in the area from Luzhou to Kuimen, and it is much easier to pull the tow rope upstream. Scientific Tidbits: The Chemical Composition of Preserved Eggs by Dan</p>
<p>Preserved eggs have a inexplicably strange smell, but when we eat them, we inexplicably find them delicious. Preserved eggs are made of chicken eggs or duck eggs. Their size and shape are no different from the original chicken eggs or duck eggs, but their color has completely changed. Both the egg white and the egg yolk are completely unlike their original appearance. - Don't you think this thing is weird?</p>
<p>Villagers know how to make preserved eggs, but they don't understand why preserved eggs have such pigments and flavors, they just find it strange. Urban intellectuals eat preserved eggs and know that they are made by chemical reactions, but they don't understand how these chemical reactions work. According to the research of many modern scientists, the coagulation, discoloration, and flavor change of preserved eggs are due to the action of bacteria. In 1916, K. Blunt and C. C. Wany made a detailed chemical analysis of preserved eggs and compared them with fresh eggs, and found that the following major changes occurred in the manufacture of preserved eggs:</p>
<p>1.  Most of the moisture in the egg white migrates to the yolk, and some of it penetrates the eggshell and disappears to the outside. Therefore, the inside of the preserved egg is often not as dry as its outer part (the original egg white part).</p>
<p>2.  The ash content and the basicity of the ash are increased, similar to eggs stored in alkali.</p>
<p>3.  Ether extracts are reduced, but their acidity is increased.</p>
<p>4.  Total nitrogen and lysine nitrogen are reduced.</p>
<p>5.  Non-coagulable nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen are increased, especially the latter increases significantly.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, they further pointed out that proteins and phospholipoids are decomposed in the manufacture of preserved eggs. The preservation of fresh eggs is due to the action of certain saline substances, bacteria, and enzymes.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you compare preserved eggs with various rotten eggs, there are many similarities between the two. However, most rotten eggs have the smell of hydrogen sulfide, while preserved eggs do not. Its smell is a very strong ammonia odor. However, no matter what, the similarity between preserved eggs and rotten eggs is always a manifestation of the bacterial action in the manufacture of preserved eggs.</p>
<p>Preserved eggs made by bacterial action, which have a bad smell and are similar to ordinary rotten eggs, should be considered very unhygienic according to common judgment. But it is not. According to Trussot's research in 1926, although fresh eggs undergo various chemical and bacterial actions to become preserved eggs, various vitamins originally in fresh eggs are preserved almost as they were, except that vitamin B is completely destroyed. According to this study, preserved eggs are not unhygienic foods.</p>
<p>As for the content of special ingredients in preserved eggs, it is as follows:</p>
<p>What is the effect of these special ingredients? Why do these special ingredients combine to become preserved eggs? This is a very complicated chemical problem and we cannot explain it in detail. At the same time, preserved eggs mostly have wonderful patterns, and these patterns are often similar to the original material of the ash that wraps them. For example, preserved eggs wrapped in ash burned from pine and cypress leaves will show patterns similar to pine and cypress leaves. What is the reason for this? Of course, it is also a wonderful chemical reaction, but how does this reaction occur? Why is the result like that? It seems that no one can specifically explain it now. Therefore, many questions about preserved eggs still need to be carefully studied, which can not only promote the progress of preserved egg production, but also has great significance in science. Humorous Sketch: Cunning by Boming (translator)</p>
<p>Grisele was a cunning maid. One day, the master said to her: "I have invited some friends to dinner today, bake me some of the best chickens."</p>
<p>"Okay, master," she replied.</p>
<p>She went out and killed two of the fattest chickens, cleaned them up, and prepared them to be baked.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, she put them on the spit in front of the fire, and everything was ready. After a considerable amount of time, she baked them until they were brown. But the guests had not yet arrived, so she went to the master and said: "If these chickens are baked any longer, they will be completely ruined. If they don't come to eat them soon, it will be a sad and shameful thing!"</p>
<p>Therefore, her master said: "I will go and call the guests myself." and went out.</p>
<p>As soon as he turned his back, Grisele took the chickens aside and thought: "I have been standing by the fire for so long, it has made me very thirsty. Who knows when they will come? Instead of waiting, I might as well go to the wine cellar for a little drink." So she picked up a bottle and said: "Yes, Grisele, you can drink to your heart's content. Wine is so mesmerizing! And the work of baking chicken won't be hindered by your drinking." She kept drinking until the bottle was empty.</p>
<p>After drinking, she went into the kitchen, put the chickens back in front of the fire, coated them with lard, and kept turning them, turning them so fast that the fire baked the chickens brown and the skin wrinkled. "If they taste it carefully, they won't miss a single piece of it." she said to herself. Therefore, she dipped her finger in the basin of oil dripping from the roasting chickens and tasted it, exclaiming: "Oh, how good these chickens are! It's a sin, it's an insult, that there's no one here to eat them!"</p>
<p>She ran to the window to see if her master and the guests were coming, but she didn't see anyone, so she went back to stand by the chickens and thought: "One wing of that chicken is a little burnt, I'd better secretly eat it." Thinking of this, she cut off the slightly burnt wing and ate it. It tasted so delicious. After she finished eating, she thought again: "I have to eat the other wing too. The master won't notice anything missing."</p>
<p>After both wings were eaten, Grisele went to see her master again, but he was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5: Timely Essay: Fireflies - Surgeons in the Insect World by Guan Qi</p>
<p>The summer heat has dissipated, the bamboo curtain is rolled up high, and the evening breeze blows in from outside the window. Lying on the cool bamboo mat, I watch the fireflies flying back and forth, timidly dancing in the corners of the walls. What a poetic moment this is! "A green silk fan to catch fireflies" has long been a metaphor for an eternal beautiful scene.</p>
<p>Fireflies are not only the theme of poets, but also the only outstanding ornament that embellishes summer nights. Stars in the sky, green fireflies all over the ground, shining brightly, competing with each other, what a mysterious night this is.</p>
<p>What makes fireflies the most aesthetically pleasing is naturally the small lantern they carry, and the light in this lantern is so gentle, so dim, so faint, just like the gentle tears shed by the moon. Therefore, the Greeks gave it a beautiful name, called Lampyre, which means "the poetic soul traveling at night with a lamp."</p>
<p>Does anyone know the state and function of firefly light? There are already many people who have studied this thing. Some chemists cruelly captured them and experimented to see if they carried a large amount of phosphorus, and whether the combination of phosphorus and oxygen emitted this green light? But the result of the experiment completely failed. Later, the French entomologist Fabre gently swept the firefly's light onto a piece of white cloth with a thin piece of leaf, and then looked at it under a microscope. He saw tiny, shimmering, grain-like luminous substances, and then loaded them into a vacuum tube, and these grain-like substances still emitted light. But what exactly this substance is, no one knows yet. It is only known that it is not phosphorus, which was generally believed by people in the past.</p>
<p>The intensity of firefly light varies depending on the sex. Originally, from the larva stage, both males and females have a faint flame at the end of their tail. But when they grow up, the males grow wings and can fly. At this time, the last three segments of the tail emit a strong light, which shines through the back, so the last three segments of the abdomen and back are all bright. When the females reach "puberty," they do not grow wings and cannot fly, but about three segments at the end of the tail increase a band, and the band emits light that is even stronger than that of the male. However, this light cannot penetrate the back.</p>
<p>What is the role of firefly light for themselves? Decoration? Lighting the dark road? No, neither. This light is their sacred torch when they get married. They rely on this light to give their lovers a target to grope for, so that they will not be disappointed and unable to find them. However, because the location of their light is different, the female's firelight is under her abdomen and she crawls, how can the male see it? Originally, the female's firelight is not transparent because she cannot fly. If there is light on her back, she will easily be invaded by enemies, but there is of course another clever method for her lover: the female often crawls in a place without enemies and starts to dance the "grass skirt dance," twisting her tail and shaking her waist, so that the light under her abdomen is easily seen by the male, to achieve their passionate purpose.</p>
<p>When they get married, the firelight temporarily goes out; this is probably to maintain some of the mystery of male and female behavior!</p>
<p>They have the right to control the on and off of the firelight themselves. Whether male or female, there is a small tube next to the light-emitting band. One end of this tube can be divided into many small tubes at any time. According to Fabre's experiment, this tube does not belong to the respiratory tract, but is dedicated to managing the entry and exit of air, to blow up the lights at the end of the tail to attract the opposite sex, or to extinguish this small lantern to avoid enemies.</p>
<p>The shape of the firefly is not as beautiful as we imagine. It is completely like a beetle, with a hard carapace on its back, which is maroon. The chest is slightly pink, and each segment of the tail has two small pieces of bright maroon armor on both sides. It has six legs and a pair of small pincers next to its mouth. The male is small and can fly, while the female is larger and walks.</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese legends believe that fireflies are transformed from rotten grass. The origin of this legend is nothing more than the fact that fireflies like to live in groups on fallen leaves and rotten grass. Everyone knows that fireflies' food is snails. This kind of food is only easily obtained in this humid and decaying place. The method of fireflies preying on snails is really interesting. When it sees a snail stopping on the ground or crawling, it gently approaches and pats it a few times with its feet as if to show affection. The snail quickly shrinks its body into its shell and does not move. It then uses its pincers to inject a special anesthetic into the shell, and the snail goes to "the West" without any pain. Surgeons, don't be proud of your ether, chloroform, cocaine... In the insect world, there was such a clever operation long before you even dreamed of any anesthetics. After the snail dies, the firefly that caught the snail spreads its wings and flies away, inviting guests everywhere; the firefly groups then each inject some gastric juice to rot the snail's carcass. They wait until it rots before they drink this snail soup.</p>
<p>In Africa, there is a type of firefly that does not emit light, which often stops on the shell of snails, patiently waiting for the snails to stick their heads out to breathe or get food, and then injects a needle into them, obtaining a feast silently.</p>
<p>Fireflies have love for friends and love for couples, but they lack love for their children. They lay eggs soon after mating. The future mother never chooses the place to lay eggs, sometimes laying them on leaves, sometimes on damp soil; after laying them, she does not care about how or when her future children will come into the world. But firefly eggs hatch very quickly, and they can be independent as soon as they hatch, without needing any swaddling from their mothers.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, firefly eggs are white and round, and can also emit light. Fabre once broke open a female firefly about to lay eggs, and a string of glittering, shining things flowed from his fingers. He said it was like he had broken a bottle containing phosphorus oxide.</p>
<p>The active period of fireflies is in midsummer and early autumn. When the weather gets cold and the fallen leaves fall, they crawl into the cellar to avoid the severe winter. Fabre once caught a few fireflies and placed them in a copper bowl filled with thick sand and some fallen leaves; in the coldest time, he saw them burrow into the sand three or four inches deep. Even in the deep winter, when hibernating, there is still a faint light at the end of their tails.</p>
<p>When winter is gone and spring comes, and all things recover, around April, when birds sing and flowers are fragrant, they climb to the ground again to carry out their molting and reproduction. Radio Program:</p>

<p>"Who knows," she said to herself. "Perhaps the guests aren't coming, or even that the master is staying for dinner, so she's not coming back. Alas, Grisele! So much good stuff left for you! That piece of chicken also made me thirsty, I must have another drink before I eat all this good stuff."</p>
<p>So she went into the wine cellar and drank a lot of wine again, then returned to the kitchen and sat down, and ate the remaining part of the chicken with great relish.</p>
<p>Now there was only one chicken left, and her master had not returned. Grisele began to look at that one with longing eyes. Finally, she said, "Where one chicken goes, the other must be sent to the location of the first, because these chickens are dependent on each other, and if one tastes good, the other must be good too. I have to drink some more wine, I believe it won't harm me."</p>
<p>The last drink gave her courage, and she returned to the kitchen to send the second chicken into her stomach after the first.</p>
<p>While she was enjoying the last bite, her master came home.</p>
<p>"Hurry, Grisele!" he shouted. "The guests will be here in a few minutes!"</p>
<p>"Yes, master," she replied. "It will be completely ready immediately."</p>
<p>At the same time, the master saw that the tablecloth had been laid and everything had been placed neatly, so he picked up the knife prepared for cutting the chicken and went out to the corridor to sharpen it on a stone.</p>
<p>As he was sharpening the knife, the guests arrived. They knocked on the door slowly and politely. Grisele ran out to see who it was. When she saw it was the guests, she put her finger on her lips and whispered, "Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Go back as quickly as you came! If my master catches you, it will be unfortunate! He invited you to dinner tonight for no other reason than to cut off each of your ears. Listen, you can hear him sharpening the knife."</p>
<p>When the guests heard this, they fled down the steps as quickly as possible and disappeared immediately.</p>
<p>Without delay, Grisele ran back to her master in a hurry and shouted, "Indeed, you invited good guests!"</p>
<p>"Huh, why, Grisele, what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" she shouted. "They just came, and I was about to bring the two chickens over in a basin, but they snatched them and ran away."</p>
<p>"Strange and weird!" said the master. He was so saddened by the loss of his wonderful meal. He rushed out to track down the thieves. "If they had only left one for me, or at least enough for my own meal..." he shouted, running after them. But the more he shouted for them to stop, the faster they ran. "Just one! Just one!" he meant, "if they had left him 'just a pair of chickens'," but the guests thought he was saying, "Just one ear," which was what he wanted to cut off. They fled as if fire was burning around them, until they realized that their ears had not been caught and they were safely sitting at home before they felt at ease. Amateur Learning: Lin Yutang's Thirteen Principles for Learning English by Lin Tu</p>
<p>1.  Establish a foundation in spoken language. Any method can be used as long as this goal is achieved.</p>
<p>2.  Students must actively participate in practice in the classroom, not being afraid of making mistakes or losing points.</p>
<p>3.  Whenever encountering a new word, pay equal attention to hearing, speaking, writing, and reading.</p>
<p>4.  You should try your best to practice English and listen to English in the classroom to absorb English grammar.</p>
<p>5.  Pay attention to imitation and recitation as the best methods to develop proper habits, and do not overemphasize rational analysis and grammatical rules.</p>
<p>6.  When the meaning of a sentence or word is unclear, you can use the translation method, but you must not use translation as a practice style exclusively. The use of translating sentences can be used for comparison to show the difference between the grammar of the native language and the foreign language.</p>
<p>7.  Pay attention to the usage of words. The meaning of words should be regarded as living, vivid, and changeable. If you do not know the usage of a word, you cannot be considered to understand its meaning.</p>
<p>8.  Pay attention to the usage of daily idioms, function words, and common words. Once the general framework is prepared, it is not difficult to insert unfamiliar words.</p>
<p>9.  Whenever there is a meaning to express, you must resolutely try it with the teacher's guidance.</p>
<p>10. Whenever speaking English, you must speak in complete sentences, and you cannot be limited to words such as "Yes" and "No." It may seem difficult at first, but you will definitely improve in the future.</p>
<p>11. Use the objective inductive method to learn grammar, that is, always pay attention to the morphological changes and usage of words. When you see similar changes in the reader, ask questions and seek guidance from grammar to solve them. After receiving guidance from grammar, you must always observe its changes in the reader for verification.</p>
<p>12. There must be some writing practice.</p>
<p>13. Spelling must be accurate and pronunciation must be correct. Small Treatise: The Trend of Industrialization by Wang Tang</p>
<p>After the development of capitalism, it broke the previous system of integrating industry and agriculture. Because it made the industrial components in the agricultural economy independent, and turned farmers into two opposing classes: the agricultural petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat. And the former is subject to the authority of capital due to market conditions and loan conditions. At the same time, we see the separation of cities and villages, with the former becoming an industrial center. This differentiation is also found internationally, with Western Europe becoming the "world's industrial center," while other regions are merely suppliers of raw materials. For example, East India was forced to produce cotton, wool, hemp, indigo, etc. for Great Britain.</p>
<p>However, soon, capitalism easily transitioned to industrial capitalism. Certain industries, due to geographical convenience, flourished in agricultural countries. Because raw materials in a semi-manufactured state can be transported at a lower freight rate. As a result, many agricultural countries have been industrialized.</p>
<p>This development, combined with the development of industrial capital and banking capital, formed financial capital.</p>
<p>The process of industrialization was further accelerated by the World War. The lack of postal ships, the increase in freight rates, and the lack of industrial products in the belligerent countries themselves further promoted the industrial development of coastal agricultural countries, although there was still a lack of machinery and skilled workers at that time.</p>
<p>After the war, after the prosperous period of capital countries reached its peak again, the European industrial production agencies once again adapted to the state of peace, and the products of European industrial countries once again showed their presence in the markets of agricultural areas. As a result, the nascent industries of the latter immediately discovered a serious crisis, and many things that emerged like bamboo shoots after a rain during the war collapsed and could not exist.</p>
<p>The effort to support national industries is also followed by the significance of national self-defense. The experience of the World War pointed out what the final development of armaments has decided, that is, if every country does not have its own industry, it will not have the power to win in the event of war. Therefore, every country is trying to cultivate the part of the industry that it needs in wartime through a high protection tariff policy.</p>
<p>In this way, a political meaning is inevitably mixed in. Truly oppressed colonies, such as Egypt, Korea, and French Africa, of course do not have the ability to implement their own tariff policies. Even in China, tariff sovereignty is fiercely restricted by various imperialists, and is forced to adopt the lowest tax rate in the world. But there are many other countries that, despite being weaker than the imperialist powers, are working hard to exercise their power to develop their own independent tariff policies and achieve the goal of creating their own industries.</p>
<p>However, although the small countries have this attempt to create their own industries, several sectors are limited by the weakness of domestic consumption, because they cannot consume the excessive output of the modern industrial system. As a result, many unimportant small enterprises are produced, so the tariff policies of the small countries have become an obstacle to the free development of productive forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the economic situation was slightly stabilized, the sale of industrial products has become a major problem for European industrial countries. As a result, a new economic and political army has suddenly risen in opposition to the protection tariff system of agricultural countries. We only need to remember the famous declaration of the banking group, which issued a warning and reduced the protection tariff rate for those that were forcibly industrialized.</p>
<p>Many of the resolutions on free trade at the World Economic Conference are still shelved there without practical effect. No place has reduced tariff barriers, and "artificial promotion of industry" continues to be enthusiastically pursued.</p>
<p>Looking at the fact that industrial acceleration is retreating in the agricultural countries, agriculturalization is indeed an inevitable trend. But this time it is not a recovery of the old type of agriculture.</p>
<p>Let's first take a look at the machinery industry. 85% of machinery output is concentrated in three countries, namely Germany, Britain, and the United States. The machinery obtained by new industrial countries mostly comes from these three countries. As can be seen from the table below, their consumption is greater than before the war in absolute numbers, but there is no change in its percentage of world consumption.</p>
<p>Consumption in millions of marks at current prices, percentage of world consumption</p>
<p>05, 2.6, Japan 324, 0.8, China 54, 0.2, British India 225, 1.0, Other parts of Asia 76, 0.5, Australia 292, 1.1, South African Federation 99, 0.5, Rest of Africa 68, 0.3</p>
<p>However, in several countries, such as British India and Australia, their machinery industry is just beginning, and the consumption of machinery should be a little greater than this figure. However, the output of machinery is still a monopoly of European and American industry, and emerging industrial countries completely rely on European and American industry to purchase their production equipment. In short, the trend of development in agricultural countries is still some basic industrial sectors (such as crude cotton industry in various textile industrial sectors), and the industries that produce relatively refined industrial products require a market that is larger than what agricultural countries can have, special skilled workers, etc. Therefore, the latest industrial science and the most refined production methods can only be adopted in old industrial countries.</p>
<p>The trend towards industrialization is most evident in the development of the textile industry in all agricultural countries, as shown in the table below (number of cotton spindles in thousands):</p>
<p>Within the realm of the textile industry, the trend of industrialization is fully expressed.</p>
<p>In summary, we can affirm that many statistical materials have definitely proved the existence of the trend of industrialization, which is different from the mere desire of capitalism to drag the colonies into the production of raw materials.</p>
<p>To briefly repeat: we see that free competition capitalism wants to turn coastal countries into agricultural areas exclusively producing raw materials and food for Western Europe, while the world's industrial areas have encountered strong counterattacks such as capital exports, protection tariff rates, and wars during the imperialist period. Because of the need to find a market for industrial production, the imperialist industrial capital after the war aroused the attempt to force weak countries to adopt agricultural policies, but this attempt was ultimately blocked by the contradiction between the general interests of the industrial bourgeoisie and the special interests of individual capitalism.</p>
<p>The trend of industrialization is definitely the only darling in today's economic system. Literary Work: Going Back to My Hometown (3) by David</p>

<h3 id="e44">Comprehensive Unfolding of the Pacific Problem <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Record</p>
<p>The Pacific Academic Conference has been going on for two weeks since its opening, with heated discussions. The focus of the issues has shifted from the American policy of isolation to the issue of permanent neutrality for the Philippines. The conflict between Britain and Japan in the South Pacific commodity market has shifted to the Far East issue. The Far East issue has been discussed more specifically regarding the opposition between Japan and the Soviet Union. The opposition between Britain, America, and Japan. The possibility of a German-Japanese alliance and its impact on the new international situation. Finally, there was a comprehensive discussion on the issue of a Pacific peace organization.</p>
<p>Although this conference outwardly only displays the signboard of academic discussion and appears to contain no political significance, in today's extremely complex international relations, what international conference can transcend the political whirlpool? Therefore, the nature of the Pacific Academic Conference can be said to be a probe into formal conferences between countries with Pacific relations. Its process and its results are very worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>There are two main characteristics of this conference. First, the issues discussed can grasp the center of the conflict. The economic, political, and military issues are all merged into one furnace. The starting point is the conflict of economic interests, with the outward development of Japanese power as the center, turning the Pacific problem from a partial unfolding to a comprehensive one, and presenting the organizational structure of international relations between the great powers in its entirety. Second, the initial invitation of Soviet Russia to participate in the Pacific Society is sufficient to prove that the great powers with vested interests in the Pacific do not ignore this element of Soviet Russia. This is a peaceful factor amidst the turbulent Pacific situation. It has enormous restraining power on the aggressive actions of aggressors. However, precisely because it has the above two characteristics, the problem becomes more complex, and heated debates and head-on collisions become the only characteristics of the conference.</p>
<p>First of all, what we should put forward is Japan's position. What is Japan's position? Japanese representative Yoshizawa put forward the fallacy of population expansion as the theoretical basis for invading China. At the same time, he put forward the superiority of the Yamato nation as the only reason for dumping its goods on the world market. Therefore, Japan insists on the principle of exclusive control over China, the proposition of equal naval rights, and proposes to revise the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>Of course, Britain opposes this position of Japan, but it has not abandoned the principle of compromise with Japan. The British representative warned Japan "not to fall into a position of isolation." This is tantamount to clearly saying "Japan should join forces with Britain to jointly solve the Far East problem."</p>
<p>Secondly, what exactly is the position of the United States, which has a significant influence? The position of the United States can be based on the words of the American representative MacDonald. He said, "To maintain peace in the Far East, three fundamental principles must be recognized: that other powers should recognize Japan's special position in the Far East; that China should be determined to maintain its independence; and that Japan should recognize that other countries are determined not to abandon their interests in the Far East." This kind of argument clearly indicates that there is a great possibility of compromise in the future Far East problem under the principle that Japan earnestly recognizes and respects the interests of all countries in China.</p>
<p>Under this atmosphere, the issue of revising the Nine-Power Treaty based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact was put forward by the Canadian representative. And Japan also expressed its acceptance of this principle. This news, whether it will be a storm or rain in the future, we dare not predict at present, but this is obviously a concession by the powers to the aggressor. We should closely monitor its future development.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Central Government Implements Remedial Education for Unemployed People (1) Zhong Lingxiu of the Ministry of Education Gives a Broadcast Speech <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Lingxiu, Section Chief of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, gave a speech on the 23rd of this month at the Central Broadcasting Station to the National People's Education Halls on the importance of implementing remedial education for unemployed people and the steps and preparations for its implementation. His words were as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Importance of Implementing Remedial Education for Unemployed People</p>
<p>In our China, there are approximately 220.2 million unemployed youths and adult men and women who are over the age of compulsory education, accounting for half of the country's population. These people are all over the age of 16, and are in the prime of their lives and are the backbone of society. All social labor, business operations, local defense, family services, and all construction and production industries depend on their active power. Therefore, based on their position in society, they are very important. However, due to various reasons, they did not receive education during their school years, and they are still not educated as they grow older, so they are ignorant, lack common sense, and have weak abilities, forming an incomplete social organization and an unsolid national foundation. The only way to remedy this now is to have them quickly receive a short-term remedial education, so that they can acquire basic common sense necessary for citizens and necessary for life, possess national consciousness and national concepts, be able to abide by discipline, take responsibility, be organized, have ability, unite sincerely, resist insults, and survive, in order to increase the country's immeasurable strength. Therefore, the central government had a resolution in the 18th year to "vigorously implement remedial education for adult people." The Ministry of Education put forward a preliminary plan for remedial education for adult people at the Second National Education Conference in the 18th year, which was unanimously adopted. However, the plan required a large amount of money, about 60 million yuan per year. Because the national treasury was in deficit at that time, and natural and man-made disasters came one after another, it was shelved indefinitely and could not be implemented on a large scale. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Education promulgated the General Outline of Measures for People's Schools, urging all provinces and cities to follow it. However, because most provinces and cities are free to organize, with no overall plan and no mandatory deadline, the statistical results from the 17th to the 23rd years of the Republic of China show that the number of people who have received education in people's schools in all provinces and cities is only more than 6.7 million, averaging less than 1 million people per year. If we continue to move forward according to this scale, it will take more than 200 years to eliminate these more than 200 million illiterate people. What a serious and urgent problem this is! Article 50 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage promulgated by the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China stipulates that "children who have reached school age shall receive compulsory education, and the details shall be determined by law." Article 51 stipulates that "people who have not received compulsory education shall receive adult remedial education, and the details shall be determined by law." Article 135 of the draft Constitution of the Republic of China announced in the 25th year of the Republic of China stipulates that "children of school age from six to twelve shall receive basic education uniformly, and tuition fees shall be waived, and the details shall be determined by law." Article 136 stipulates that "people who are over school age and have not received basic education shall receive remedial education uniformly, and tuition fees shall be waived, and the details shall be determined by law." It can be seen that the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution have the same provisions and the same emphasis on compulsory education and remedial education. However, according to the facts, the number of school-age children who are out of school is only more than 37 million nationwide, while the number of unemployed youths and adults is more than 220.2 million, which is more than six times the number of school-age children. In recent years, the government has allocated huge sums of money and organized large-scale compulsory education, adding many primary schools and trying to make them receive compulsory education. We should also find ways to make the unemployed youths and adults, who are six times this number, receive remedial education, so as to conform to the main purpose of national legislation, and also pay the same attention to the facts. The Ministry of Education, in view of this, stipulated in the education administration plan for the 25th year that it will implement remedial education for unemployed people, promote people's schools, so that unemployed people can receive remedial education, and drafted the General Outline of Measures for Implementing Remedial Education for Unemployed People, which was submitted to the 273rd meeting of the Executive Yuan on August 4, 25th year and was approved, and was circulated to all provinces and cities on August 15 for compliance. This plan will be completed within the next six years. This is a major educational facility that the National Government has wanted to implement since it moved to Nanjing ten years ago, but has not been able to do so. It is also a memorable event in the history of education. Its importance is more important than compulsory education.</p>
<p>2. Implementation Steps</p>
<p>There are more than 220.2 million unemployed youths and adults, which is too many. It should be implemented in stages over the years, which is permitted by the country's current manpower and financial resources. The implementation steps are divided into the following items:</p>
<p>A. Phased Implementation Procedure Article 4 of the General Outline of Measures for Implementing Remedial Education for Unemployed People stipulates that "each province and city shall popularize it within six years, starting from the 25th year of the Republic of China (provinces and cities with special circumstances may apply for approval to shorten or extend the deadline). Each county and city shall add 20 to 40 people's schools each year, and each school shall run at least two terms each year, each term lasting about three months to six months (in rural areas, agricultural busy seasons should be avoided). Each term shall be based on the principle of running two classes. The aforementioned people's schools may be attached to various primary schools and other schools, and various public institutions, but at least half of them should still be established independently. According to this provision, the steps for establishing schools and the number of people receiving education in each province and city are specified below: (1) Within the first year (August 25th year of the Republic of China to July 26th year of the Republic of China), each city and large county shall designate 40 townships and towns with slightly more financial resources and densely populated areas, and establish one school each, totaling 40 schools, which can teach 8,000 people. Medium-sized counties shall establish 30 schools, which can teach 6,000 people. Small counties shall establish 20 schools, which can teach 4,000 people. On average, each county can teach 6,000 people. The national total of 2,000 counties and cities will have 12 million unemployed people receiving training.</p>
<p>(2) Within the second year (August 26th year of the Republic of China to July 27th year of the Republic of China), each county and city shall designate the place where it should be established to add 20 schools. Together with the number of schools established in the previous year, large counties will have a total of 60 schools, which can teach 12,000 people. Medium-sized counties will have a total of 50 schools, which can teach 10,000 people. Small counties will have a total of 40 schools, which can teach 8,000 people. On average, each county can teach 10,000 people. The national total of 2,000 counties and cities will have 20 million unemployed people receiving training.</p>
<p>(3) Within the third year (August 27th year of the Republic of China to July 28th year of the Republic of China), each county and city shall designate other places where schools have not been established to add 20 schools. Together with the number of schools established in the previous year, large counties will have a total of 80 schools, which can teach 16,000 people. Medium-sized counties will have a total of 70 schools, which can teach 14,000 people. Small counties will have a total of 60 schools, which can teach 12,000 people. On average, each county can teach 14,000 people. The national total of 2,000 counties and cities will have 28 million unemployed people receiving training.</p>
<p>(4) Within the fourth year (August 28th year of the Republic of China to July 29th year of the Republic of China), each county and city shall designate other places where schools have not been established to add 20 schools. Together with the number of schools established in the previous year, large counties will have a total of 100 schools, which can teach 20,000 people. Medium-sized counties will have a total of 90 schools, which can teach 18,000 people. Small counties will have a total of 80 schools, which can teach 16,000 people. On average, each county can teach 18,000 people. The national total of counties and cities will have 36 million unemployed people receiving training.</p>
<p>(5) Within the fifth year (August 29th year of the Republic of China to July 30th year of the Republic of China), each county and city shall designate other places where schools have not been established to add 20 schools. Together with the number of schools established in the previous year, large counties will have a total of 120 schools, which can teach 24,000 people. Medium-sized counties will have a total of 110 schools, which can teach 22,000 people. Small counties will have a total of 100 schools, which can teach 20,000 people. On average, each county can teach 22,000 people. The national total of 2,000 counties and cities will have a total of 44 million unemployed people receiving training.</p>
<p>(6) Within the sixth year (August 30th year of the Republic of China to July 31st year of the Republic of China), each county and city shall designate other places where schools have not been established to add 20 schools. Together with the number of schools established in the previous year, large counties will have a total of 140 schools, which can teach 28,000 people. Medium-sized counties will have a total of 130 schools, which can teach 26,000 people. Small counties will have a total of 120 schools, which can teach 24,000 people. On average, each county can teach 26,000 people. The national total of 2,000 counties and cities will have a total of 52 million unemployed people receiving training. (To be continued)</p>
