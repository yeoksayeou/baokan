<h3 id="c10">日本擅在成都設領問題 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>在最近的中日外交關係中。發生了一個不大不小的問題。這問題就是日本不依據條約的規定。而擅在成都設立總領事館。派遣該國駐華大使館情報部中國班長岩井英一任領事。代行總領事職務。岩井自六月下旬回國請訓。於上月杪回滬後。卽於本月二日乘船往成都任事。據中央社電訊。我國外交部曾通知日本使館制止此舉。同時四川旅滬伺鄕會也通電反對。可是岩井仍不顧一切。而去走為上任了。</p>
<p>我們為什麽說這是最近中日外交關係上一個不大不小的問題呢。因為中日間儘有許多比這個更大無數倍的問題。而日本此舉。對於我國的主權的損害究竟也是不小的。原來依照國際公法的原則。領事的派遣。必須有條的的根據。而在中國與外國所訂的現行條約中。祗准許條約口岸可由外國派遣領事。成都旣不是條約口岸。也不是自開的口岸。日本自沒有擅自設領的理由。要是日本可擅自在成都設領。那末以後也可援例在中國其他任何內地設領了。這於中國的主權不是有很大的妨害嗎。而且帝國主義者在中國的設領。同一般國際間的設領。是有極大不同的。因為帝國主義者在華享有領事裁判權。所有領事的地位也同外交官（指大使。公使等。領事並非外交官）一樣。享有許多的治外法權。要是中國內地都任帝國主義者擅設領事。那未領事裁判權的應用範圍。自然也更擴大。在我們正在努力廢止領事裁判權的時候。日本的擅自設領行動。自當極力反對的。</p>
<p>現在岩井已不顧一切而走馬上任去了。我們應當用什麽方法去制止呢。第一。我國外交部應依據現行條約的規定。成都非條約口岸。不准設領的原則。去向日本交涉制止。在過去。成都因為是四川省城的關係。駐重慶的各國領事。為接洽事情方便起見。曾派代表常駐成都。但英德二國早已因我外交部的抗議而取消。法國也於不久以前取消。而現在日本却反進一步設立總領事館。這當然是毫無法理的根據的。其决。依照國際公法的原則。一個領事的赴任。須先向駐領國的外交部取得認可證（Exequatur）。否則就卽拒絕其使行職務。依據中央社的電訊。我國外交部旣請日本制止在成都擅設總領事館。那末對於岩井的被任領事。當然不會予以同意。給以認可證。岩井旣然不得我國外交部的認可蹬。那末我們就可依照國際慣例。不承認岩井之領事的地位。而阻止他行使領事職務的。</p>
<p>不過上面所說的。是就國際法的觀點說的。而在現在的國際社會中。國際法最沒有力量。所有重要的國際條約多已被帝國主義者的槍尖戳成破紙。舉眼前的例子說。日本可在我國內地擅自設領。而中國派駐朝鮮淸津港的隨習領事孫秉乾等七人。日本軍事當局却可不依國際慣例。而逮捕下獄。所以我們要想解决這個不大不小的問題。還得先從解决中日間更大的問題着手。換句話說。我們亟須重新建立整個的對日外交政策了。</p>

<p>（巴黎）國際糾紛及歐洲和平、因西班牙內亂益趨複雜，歐洲各國互事攻訐、列强關係因之漸趨緊張、、茲將最近發展彙誌如下、藉可窺見時局危念之一斑、</p>
<p>（一）巴黎迥聲報載稱、德國主力艦「德意志」號及驅逐艦「魯赫」號顯曾阻碍西班牙政府軍軍艦轟擊摩洛哥休達港叛軍砲台、（二）時務報則稱、米蘭居民曾函告此問意僑稱、意國白里達飛機廠油漆匠三十六人曾於七月二十六二十七兩日日夜工作、塗去轟炸機十二架上之標記、此項飛機後卽飛往西班牙南方及摩洛哥接濟叛軍、此外尚有轟炸機十八架、亦已飛往西班牙戰區、（三）美聯社駐摩洛哥德土恩記者電稱、叛軍曾向意德兩國工廠定購飛機二十架、（四）美聯社駐瑪德里記者電稱、西班牙政府軍轟炸瓜達拉瑪山隘所用炸彈顯係外國製造、（五）法國領袖人物宣稱、西班牙叛軍曾徵發摩洛哥土人與政府軍作戰、顯已破壞法國與西班牙所簽訂之摩洛哥協定、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）各晨報皆歡迎英政府牒覆法政府贊助不干涉西班牙內亂之舉、泰晤士報謂政府之正常、確然無疑、各國一致採行不干涉政策、實屬要圖、西班牙雙方所為戰鬥之原則、為各國多數黨與少數黨所皆深蓄於心者、他國首常謹愼避免者、為勿使烈焰蔓延、歐洲今滿播引火之物、星星之火、卽足使燎原、不可響邇、西班牙之內戰、甚易變成歐洲之內戰云、（五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國政府昨向法國提出答復、對於關係各國締結恊定相約互不干涉西班牙內亂一項主張、已在原則上予以接受、各報評論均表滿意、但恐意國復文未必如此圓滿、名記者貝爾蒂那在巴黎廻聲報發表一文、略謂「德意兩國鑒於第三國際干涉西國內政、定將盡其能力、要求蘇聯提出解釋」、事業報外交記者塔布衣夫人則謂、「外交部長台爾博斯昨日與意國大使賽呂蒂會談之際、賽呂蒂曾提出</p>

<p>（巴黎）英比德對於法國申請聯合聲明不干涉西班牙內亂之通牒、均已答覆表示贊同、但德國之接受、以蘇俄亦予接受為條件、英國則以意國之同意為其接受條件、法國現正殷切竚候羅馬方面之覆文、而羅馬官方關於意國覆文之性質、均默無一言、但該地之外交與政治方面、均覺法國之通牒足使業已困難之局勢更增可能之糾紛、故不表示歡迎、同時法國為求此問題之得迅速解决起見、已訓令駐莫斯科與里斯本之法代表向蘇俄葡萄牙政府作同樣之建議、英國之覆文中稱、莢法意對西班牙事伴保守中立之聲明、僅為與西班牙有關之各國、尤其為英法德意葡五國在外交上談判協約之初步云、（五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於法國所提照會、卽要求關係各國成立協定、對於西班牙時局相約不予干涉者、英國政府頃已於本日午後向法國大使館提出復文據官塲人士透出消息、覆文內容對於法國所提建議、在原則上予以接受、惟附帶一項保留條件、卽英國現行法律必須予以尊重是也、又據消息靈通方面聲稱、英國政府曾在復文中鄭重聲明、對於法國所提禁止軍火輸往西班牙之議、在原則上完全同意、但主張德國與葡萄牙兩國亦應加入禁運辦法、否則必難收效、英國政府並曾要求法國、一俟接獲意國答復之後、應卽通知英國、俾英法意三國政府一俟關係各國尤其是德葡二國均願加入協定之時、卽可草擬共同宣言書、聲明禁止軍火運往西班牙也、此在政界人士聲稱、英國復文僅述及禁運軍器與子彈兩項、至於尋常商業交易、則以為不當加以禁止云、（四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間負資方面對於英國復文、印象極為良好、並謂英法兩國主張不干涉西班牙內亂問題、應在可能範圍內迅求解决、此其見解業已一致、英國政府現主張「不干涉」恊定範圍應更求擴大、而使德國與葡萄牙兩國一併加入、但亦贊成一俟意國提出滿意答復之後、英法意三國應卽發表共同宣言書云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）陸軍部發言人今日竭力否認德國主力艦「德意志」號及驅逐艦「魯赫」號開到摩洛哥休達港、足為干涉西班牙內亂之舉動、謂兩艦開到休達港、不過在保護德僑耳、外間所傳西班牙政府軍轟炸叛軍砲台時、該兩艦曾有意掩護叛軍、實屬無稽之談云、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）右派「白日」報日昨登載消息稱、政府藉載運僑民出境避難為名、派遣飛機前赴西班牙、間接援助該國政府云云、官方人士頃對此說、加以否認、並說明經過事實如下、據稱、西國境內法國外交代表前曾請求本國政府派遣飛機三架、飛往西班牙聽候調用、以便運送法國僑民出境避難、當時西國政府曾向法國提供保證、對於該飛機决不予以徵發、法國政府爰乃派遣商用飛機三架、不携軍器飛往西國、擬常川飛行瑪德里與亞利岡達兩城之間、將僑民運至亞利岡達城、再用船隻送往北菲洲法屬奧朗港、此項計劃係於上月二十九日開始實行、詎知亞利岡達城當局卽在是日徵發飛機一架、其他兩機亦於翌日一併被徵、該地法國領事當自二十九日至三十一日三天之內迭向西國當局提出抗議、迄至本月二日、西國政府已將各該飛機繳還法國矣、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>條件三項如下、（一）不可僅由英法意三國舉行談判、（二）德俄兩國亦應邀之參加、（三）法國政府不得利用西班牙內亂張大其詞、作為鼓動反法西斯主義十字軍戰爭之口實」云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>駐滬日軍</p>
<p>到庭旁聽者、仍有十餘、此為該案撤銷辯論終結後之第二度開庭、因仍係續行調查證據、無特組合議庭之必要、故由蕭推事單獨審究、先由汝律師聲明、被告楊文道所供栽贓陷害之楊建中、業經捕房一再調查、卒無從知其踪跡、致迄無法傳案質證、捕房對於此人、原本不需其作證、楊文道旣階</p>
<p>被其栽陷</p>
<p>則當負舉證之責、而將建中踪跡查明、此外應傳之證人四名、茲均傳集矣、蕭推事卽命丁書記官將上月二十八夜九時與捕房律師帶同前往高郵傳來之見證女子潘巧英赴竇樂安路出事地點履勘、經由潘女表演目覩兇手開槍擊倒中山秀雄情狀之筆錄、朗誦一過、復向三被告訊問對於</p>

<p>傳喚到滬</p>
<p>且其人不及守候、始提前於二十八日開庭，向其查訊一切、旣經訊、畢故預定之三十一日容期、自可取銷、乃外聞不明眞相、竟起誤會、要知本案今猶在繼續調查證據也、並以傳案之四證人、須隔別訊鞠、而所問者多與楊文道有關、因飭公役將楊與該四證人帶出庭外、而後逐一傳訊，先據</p>

<p>但對於此事僅知大略、如需明瞭祥細、則請詢諸楊海籌、隨據年登古稀之楊海籌證稱、彼與文道亦為遠房叔姪關係、曩因故鄉族長某行同土劣、橫行鄉里、魚肉良民、手下並有十餘死黨、前年竟將公產田地私賣、族人來函乞援、　文道回籍、故由會致函文道、着將該族長打倒、因文道</p>

<p>維持公產</p>
<p>絕無他項作用云云、質之被告楊文道、對於信函一點、所供與四證人之詞略同、並聲明該决回粵、係送其叔歸家、庭上嗣將葉海生在捕房之供詞而涉及楊文道者、向楊研詰、楊俱矢口否認、謂平生未作政治活動、旣而又言當二十一夏間、曾由友人介紹嘗一任五十五軍參議、其時軍部駐包頭、彼則在滬、就職不兩月、</p>

<p>上午歐文思在大會已創二百公尺紀錄、挾百勝之威、天才煥發、復締造跳遠世界紀錄、誠不愧雄視一世、</p>
<p>世運跳遠紀錄為七·八七公尺、為是日上午預選歐文思所造成、但此紀錄之壽侖决不能久延、因德國之郞格一躍已平等此紀錄、但歐文思又一駢而改造彼以前之世選紀錄、進為七·九七公尺、但黑星歐文思猶認為未滿、於百尺竿頭、欲更進一步、於是再躍而成八·〇六公尺、登峯造極、允無愧色、於是歐文思又多獲一金章、德國之郞格以七·八七獲第二、日本之田島直人以七·七四居第三、其餘三席為意大利之馬法、之德里尋姆、及美之克拉克、頭二者成績均為七公尺七三、克拉克成績七公尺六七</p>

<p>有健康之母體，而後有健康之嬰兒，此婦女衛生之所以首宜講求也。婦女以月經為主體，苟月經方面發生病變時，則失其健康之常，而違乎衛生之道。</p>
<p>婦女月經，有健全之卵子，而後有健全之胚胎，關係於人類之生殖，　重若是。在昔日之婦女，深藏　　，不與世接，故不知時勢，而多執拗，肝　之病良深，運動廢弛皆是。近代婦女，交際繁多，侈方解放，涉足市塲，放縱之弊益深，月經之病益顯。或因貧苦之家，操勞太過，或因家庭壓迫，束縛太嚴。游戲過度，則神馳於外，憂　過度，則氣滯於中，凡此種種，皆是以釀成月經之病症。</p>
<p>調經這道，以去病為首務。　受病而致月經不調者，去其病則經病自愈，所謂原因的療法是也。如因悲哀太過。或忿怒傷肝，或　給不舒，或驚　失常，致氣血歸併，神經受其影響，俗稱為神經病，以血隨氣行，氣病則血病也。方書以　前為熱，退後為塞，其理近似，然亦不可盡拘，假如臟腑空虛，經水淋漓不斷，頻頻數見，不可便斷為熱，又如內熱，血枯，經脈遲滯不平，不可便斷為寒，必須察其兼證，如果脈數內熱，唇焦口燥，畏熱喜冷，斯為有熱，如果脈遲脈冷，舌淡口和，喜熱畏寒，斯為有寒，且其經來血多色鮮者，血有餘也，血少色淡者，氣滯腹凝也，旣行而虛痛，喜手按者，氣虛血少也。患此症者，宜內服「佛慈當歸素」，為家庭簡單之有效療法，如服用數星期，定能使經期准常，恢復其健康之美。</p>
<p>按當歸乃　形科　物當歸之根，產於我國本部各地，為婦科聖藥，能使氣血各有所歸得名，神農本經及李時珍本草，皆認當歸為補血調經溫宮姙娠之唯一聖品。德國婦科專家希爾特博士研究中國醫藥，將中國產當歸，應用科學方法，抽出其有效成分，屢經動物試騐，結果皆得奇效，因之泰西醫界公認當歸為婦科特效藥，而我國新醫亦多賞用也。</p>
<p>「佛慈當歸素」係根據我國古傳騐方當歸散，及婦人良方之當歸飲，必效方之當歸粉，普濟方之當歸丸，聖惠方之當歸煎等改良調製者，故有數千年臨床實騐之歷史，而本廠復選擇國產當歸，應用眞空蒸溜器，依科學的方法，提其精華以改良調製者，其功效較之外國製之當歸精，確有殊勝之功能，且服用携帶，非常便利。</p>
<p>據婦科專家安博士之報告：對月經困難病者十四人，及月經停止者四人，使服「當歸素」，皆得美滿之效果；蓋月經困難病者，服用當歸素，則其疼痛症狀，皆次第消退，且其他一切不快症狀，亦一掃而空，月經停止者，服用當歸素，其經血復為正規的來潮。又有二病婦，其子宮異常矮小，歷經名醫僉認為無法治療，最後乃試用當歸素，竟漸回復生理的月經。此種效騐，實堪驚歎。</p>
<p>綜上以觀。「佛慈當歸素」之功能，專治婦人氣血虛弱，月經不調——或前或後，或多或少，或逾月不至，或一月再至，停經閉經，經來疼痛，赤白帶下，小腹冷痛，久不受孕，宮冷不姙，及胎前產後一切諸症，確有不可思議之特效。</p>

<p>— 中央社特派員馮有眞寄</p>
<p>足球隊戰績</p>
<p>我們的足球隊自五月二日由上海出發後，轉戰南洋帬島及印度、已是兩個多月、共戰二十七次、除四次和局外、未曾失敗一次、成績可稱十分圓滿、而且這四次和局中、都由於隊員身體太過疲弱之故、例如在孟買的最後一戰、全隊由加爾各答乘了兩天兩夜的火車、七月八日早晨到孟買、下午就作戰、實力當然要大打折扣、他們能在這樣的舟車勞頓中、保持常勝威名、實在是一件不容易的事情、不過參加世運會的各國球隊、實力都很强勁、尤其是南美兩個小國和歐洲各國、最為可怕、我們要想在大會中造出一點好的成績、還需要特別努力奮鬥、這一點决心、全體隊員是都有的、可吿慰於國人、</p>
<p>記者在輪中訪問了足球部主任容啟兆、管理黃家駿、隊長李惠堂、和其他幾位隊員、據他們說這兩個月的比賽、雖然很辛苦勞頓、但球藝很有進步、最顯著的是全隊都已互相瞭解、合作已極純熟、全隊動作也很迅速、與出國前已有天壤之別、至於所有比賽、大多都很精彩滿意、有幾塲因身體關係、未能充分發揮實力、全體隊員都能注意到運動精神、留給各地觀眾以很好的印象、有幾個地方一向對中輥很蔑視的、以為中國人個個都是鴉片鬼、這次看見我們的球隊表演得這樣精彩、覺得十分驚奇、他們總算替國家出了一口怨氣、全體隊員、經過兩個月的苦鬥、身體上不免有受小傷的、但並無大礙、全體隊員共二十二人、但世運會祗准每隊參加十五人、我們的正式陣綫、雖已大致內定、還要看旅程中各人的體况、才能具體决定、所以要等到了柏林、才能正式發表、關於李惠堂的業餘資格問題、國內輿論界曾起過一度糾紛、體育協進會議决、由李氏自己向會裏提出一個書面報吿、協進會已經把這個議决、於十三日錄達李氏、大約日內將有正式答復、據李氏表示、他這次沿途撰述通訊、所以祗送申報發表、原因是希望將來能由勤奮書局替他發行單行本、並沒有受經濟上的報酬、所以並不違背業餘規則、出席大會也無問題云、現在把兩個月的戰績、登記如次、</p>
<p>射球者李惠堂二十八、譚江柏十八、孫錦順十七、馮景祥十一、楊水益八、葉北華七、鄭季良六、卓石金四、曹桂成四、賈幼良三、陳鎭和三、黃美順二、</p>
<p>阿刺伯海裏的風浪</p>
<p>七月九日正午、郵船離開孟買、在阿刺伯海中由亞洲向非洲進發、目的地是義屬以里特里亞Eritrea　的首邑馬蘇阿Massawa　、郵船啟椗的時候、船上的印度選手與岸上的歡送印人、互相揮手搖巾作別、使我們回憶起離別上海時的情形、</p>
<p>由孟買到馬蘇阿的海程、共二千〇八十海里、航行須六個日頭、是航程中最長的一節、阿刺伯海六月到八月的風浪、是向以驚險著稱的、這次果然向我們的選手、來了一個極大的示威、大家飽嘗了驚濤駭浪的滋味、直到記者執筆寫稿的時候、一個個都還神志顛倒、驚魂未定、離孟買不到一小時的光景、巨風駭浪、就向着我們猛烈的襲擊、在甲板上玩賞海景、在吸烟室談笑游樂的選手們、眼看着一個跟一個的、縮到臥室裏去、以後風浪是一陣緊似一陣、猛烈的海風、好像山崩地裂的發出可怕的吼聲、澎湃的波濤、湧起來好像一座小山、巨浪迎着船身拼命的衝擊、水花打起二三丈高、向着甲板上直潑過來、就像狂風一陣暴雨、船身一起伏、相距達一二十尺、走路的時候、猶如騰雲駕霧、飄搖無定、這時候甲板上固然是杳無人影、吸烟室裏也冷淸淸的毫無生氣、酒吧間裏的兩個僕歐、淸閒得簡直無事可做、</p>
<p>選手們一個個都躺到臥室裏去了、哼的哼、怨的怨、還有許多把胃裏的苦水都嘔了出來、更是痛苦不堪、臥室裏出氣的小窗、因為躱避浪花、都嚴密的關了起來、空氣是十分的汚濁、不暈船的鐵牛陳寳球、因為同房間的吳必顯吐得狼藉滿地、去打開鐵窗、想換換空氣、一個巨浪打了進來、滿房都灌注了海水、連忙喊僕歐來收拾、一共提出五鉛桶鹹水、嚇得鐵牛伸長了舌頭、半响收不回來、風浪之大、於此可見、</p>
<p>餐室裏冷靜了好幾天、早茶午茶不到二十個人、午餐晚餐不到五十個人、而且大都祗喝幾口湯、吃一點水菓、就算完事、</p>
<p>各隊中以籃球隊暈船的人最多、除于敬孝外、其餘十三個選手、沒有一個不暈船、尤以王鴻斌王玉增最厲害、也許他們都是北方人、不慣航海生活的緣故吧、</p>
<p>足球隊大概是太過疲勞了、除小黑炭陳鎭和外、沒有一個人不暈船、連學航空的徐亞輝、都不能免、李惠堂發着寒熱、上船後睡了兩天、</p>
<p>國術隊九位代表、祗有張爾鼎翟漣沅能支持得住、競走的四位代表、都暈得面紅筋漲、頭昏眼花、</p>
<p>楊秀瓊發了兩天寒熱、陳振興吃不下飯、睡不着覺、兩條魚在大海中也就無法可施了、</p>
<p>拳擊隊比較得好一點、可是王潤蘭在風浪襲擊的時期中躺着、一直沒有起來　、</p>
<p>田徑隊以吳必顯為最糟糕、賈連仁戴淑國王正林林紹洲也都不行、其餘還不錯、李森居然能在吸烟室看書寫字、眞是難得、</p>
<p>舉重隊最强、翁康廷沈良黃社基一位、一有機會、就抬起鐵担練習、沈良的成績、並且還有進步、</p>
<p>考察團的三十幾位老夫子、能見面的不到十個人、出吳淞口就暈船的、徐英超　仙渠不必說了、就是一向逞能的陳　德和袁敦禮、也大吐大嘔、女團圓更是躱得無影無踪、</p>
<p>新聞界中除記者外、其餘都勿是生意經、一上船就躺在床上、時事新報的毛以信吐得手脚抽筋、國際攝影社的羅榖蓀、躺着只是唉聲嘆氣、</p>
<p>這樣精疲力竭的暈了四天、直到十二日晚上、郵船航過了索哥特拉島Socotnal　Gulf　of　Aden風浪才漸漸的平靜下來、大家好像在牢獄中遇了特赦、莫不喜形於色、可是經過這番疲勞、大家都躭心到柏林後、一個星期的休養、能不能把元氣恢復過來、</p>

<p>在近郊的鄉村範圍、我們常可以看見這些自動服務的敎師在工作、在適當的空地或道路旁邊、他就可以將一個活動的戶外學校成立起來、第一步就用展覽的物品引起人們的注意、行人就會尋找他們有舉趣的物品、如殺除農作物害蟲的藥粉、金陵大學改良的黃豆種、美國的玉蜀黍、江寗縣的白棉種等等、到敎師引起了充分的興趣時、他就可以開始談到他的學校了、一面對話、一面動作、牠將設置改變了、箱子蓋拿下來做黑板、附在箱子裏摺收的凳子可以當坐位、如果需要的話、可以坐四十人、這樣學校分給的小板書寫、這裏很奇怪的是和美國情形接近了、當藍克司特計劃出班級制度的時候、是前世紀末在紐約成立的、他們為减少費用、就使用維克多利學派時代的石板、今天中國成人與鄉村小學生使用石板、這是很普遍的情形、</p>

<p>— 如璧</p>
<p>春秋列國時候，晋國正是献在位，他寵愛了一個妃子，名　呌姬。　姬想呌自已的兒子做太子，便在用計把太子申生害了，又在獻公面前說了許多讒官，說公子夷吾同公子重耳同太子申生同謀謀反。獻公聽信了，又派人去殺二位公子。但是二位公子跑掉了。</p>
<p>晋獻公許多兒子，其中就是公子重耳為人最好，也最禮賢下士，所以，他手下便聚集了許多人村。如像趙衰，狐偃，咎犯，介子推，魏準這一般人，都是晋國數一數二的人物公。子重耳逃出了晋國，這一般賢人也跟着他逃走。公子重耳在外面漂流了十九年，等到晋國有了內亂，才借着秦國的力量，回到晋國，登了君位，稱為文公。有了這一般賢人輔佐，當了一個覇君。</p>
<p>話說晋文公得了秦國的帮助，準備回到自己的祖國，這日到了黃河邊。這黃河，從西北上流下來，水裏挾着泥沙，翻翻滾滾，如萬馬奔騰。眞是個在風怒號，濁浪滔天了。這水裏不知道有多少龜魚蝦蟹，在那裏推波助瀾呢。</p>
<p>晋文公一行人馬來到黃河岸上，秦穆公說了幾句預祝馬到成功的話，便回車走了。河岸上只剩下護送晋文公回國的秦國人馬。同晋文公手下一般賢士。黃河裏的船隻已經預備好了。</p>
<p>一行人馬上船隻，準備開船了。咎犯突然向晋文公說：「臣跟着公子在外漂流了十九年，自己知道並沒有功勞，反轉有許多過錯。現在公子回國，登了大位，便算功成業就了。臣就在這裏拜辭了公子吧。」</p>
<p>咎犯說的是反話，他怕晋文公忘記他的功勞。晋文公也知道，於是說：「此番回國，全靠大家的力量。願向河伯立誓，一定重用咎犯！」</p>
<p>晉文公說着，就拿了一個碧玉，丟在黃河裏，便算與咎犯立了一個誓盟。咎犯謝了。這時介子推正在船裏，看見咎犯道樣，不覺笑起來；「公子得了機會，回到祖國去登君位，這原是應當的事，也可以說是晋國的幸事。咎犯却說是自己的功勞。我們跟着公子在外面漂流了十九年，原是想借着公子的地位和力量，回到祖國去，把祖國弄强盛，幹出一番事業來。現在咎犯且不想幹功立業，却先拿功勞去要挾公子；眞有功勞到也罷了，又不算是功勞。眞羞死人！」</p>
<p>因此，介子推便看不起咎犯這一般人，不願意同他們混在一道。渡過黃河，已到了晋國地界，介子推便趁忙亂裏，離開大隊，一僩人趕回故鄉，奉着母親，過着平民生活去了。</p>
<p>晋文公不見了介子推，根究起來，誰也不知道他的去向，只索罷了。俟後晋文公登了君位，平定了全國，大封功臣的時候，早把介子推忘了。介子推也不去找晋文公，訴他自己的功勞。</p>
<p>一天，介子推的隣居解張，知道晋文公大封功臣，並沒有封到介子推名下，便跑到介子推家裏來我介子推。</p>
<p>兩人在草堂裏坐定後，解張便說：「介外面漂流了十九年。現在君侯大封功臣，趙大夫他們都做了官，你幹嗎不去找了君侯，也弄一個官來做做，光耀門欄，封妻蔭子呢。」</p>
<p>介子推聽了，笑了笑，說：「解先生，話不是這樣說。君侯應該做晋國的國君，並不是我們的功勞，我那能去冒功。我從前跟着君侯在外面漂流，原想替祖國幹一番事業，現在這事不能成功了。解先生，我不是咎犯一樣的人，跟着君侯，不過是想自己升官發財，享受富貴榮華。解先生，我們談些別的閒話罷，不用提這些事了。」</p>
<p>解張見介子推的意思很堅决，也不便再說，談了一些別的話，便走了。</p>
<p>解張走後，介子推進到後堂，見了母親，便說：「解張好笑，勸兒子去找君侯，討一個官做。」</p>
<p>介母說：「兒呵，你跟着君侯漂流了十九年，盡力的地方也很多，討一個官做，也不算過分啊！」</p>
<p>介子推說：「母親，兒子不是常說，君侯是應該登位的，誰也沒有功勞，偷別人的錢，便是强盜，胃天的功勞，那更不成話了。咎犯他們說是自己的功勞，兒子還看不起他們，兒子如何能跟着他們學。並且，像這樣上上下下都想着自己升官發財的地方，兒子也處不下去。母親，你是知這兒子的性格的。」</p>
<p>分母說：「不做官也罷。你好不好俟大家都知道你曾經跟着君侯漂流了十九年？」</p>
<p>介子推說：「那又何必。兒子旣然不想做官，又何必要大家知道有兒子這樣一個人？兒子想：解張這一出去，一定要張揚起來。兒子想幹的事業，現在看起來是不會成功的了。旣然不能替祖國效力，不如到深山大林裏去，過一些淸閒日子罷。母親意下如何？」介母說：「你能够嚼菜根，受辛苦，難道我不能。都隨你，我跟着你好了。」</p>
<p>母子二人商議定了，乘夜把行李收拾定當，天不明動身，到綿山深處，結上幾間茅屋，隱居去了。</p>
<p>解張經介子推家裏出來，心裏總氣不過，這樣一個有功的人，却一點好處也沒有。越想越不平，便速夜到了晋文公宮鬥外面，寫了幾句：</p>
<p>「龍欲上天，</p>
<p>五蛇為輔。</p>
<p>龍已升雲，</p>
<p>四蛇各入其宇；</p>
<p>一蛇獨怨，</p>
<p>終不見處所。」</p>
<p>第二天，宮鬥執衛抄下了，呈給晋文公看。晉文公猛省道：「這是介子推。我一時　忘了，還沒有封他。」</p>
<p>於是便呌人到介子推家裏去召他，但是經不知去向。差官又多方打聽，好容易碰見解張，才知道介子推到綿出山隱居去了。但是解張，仍然不敢一定說介子推在綿山裏。</p>
<p>差官回去奏明，晉文公又呌他們到綿山裏去尋。差官奉命，走偏綿山，也尋不着介子推在那裏，又回去奏明。晉文公無法，便呌把綿山改成介山，說：「記着這是我的過錯；表明介子推先生是一個賢人。」</p>
<h3 id="c229">李汶斯吞小傳 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 費仁</p>
<p>—最偉六的非洲探險家—</p>
<p>大衛·李汶斯呑降生於一八一三年的蘇格蘭。方頭關臉，粗眉大目，樣子長得很笨，可是人人都愛他，因為他不但性格和善而且見解過人。他的功課作業，雖在極其精密的科學上，都是成績超人一等。</p>
<p>他從小抱有逮大的志趣。喜歡登山越嶺，過着野外的冒險生活。他的專門學問是在醫藥方面。但他都不甘株守本國本土，吃點安分的老米飯，混過幾十年日子。他的志願是在海角天涯，在森林密谷人跡不到之處，他要經歷千奇百怪，開發出人類所未曾見過的地方。抱着這樣宏願，他於是參加了倫敦傳道會，被派去非洲作傳敎事業。</p>
<p>他起初原想到中國來，因為十九世紀初年級西洋人，對於中國都有一些神秘奇怪的觀念。但是旣已被派去非洲，他就一心一意往那邊走。一到非洲，他就開始了深險的生活。他以為在非洲應當做的工作，傳敎倒還是小事，最要緊的是要作一個開路先鋒，把這個人跡未到的非洲腹地探察出來，公諸世人的耳目。至於有興辦事業，也得先把僻奧之處的土地全都開發了才行。他用了兩年的工夫由南往北，探察地方，在馬波杳地方安置了一個家，作為旅程回來的休息之所，又娶了一位太太。</p>
<p>結婚之後，李汶斯呑仍然繼續他的探險生活。他太太有時候陪他一同出去，有時守在家賽，替他整理隨時寫下的記載，使他可以放心去旅行。他最先探到了啞米湖Ngapmi　Lake，又穿過卡拉哈里沙漢，這些都是西洋人從來未曾到過的所在。他都把所得的所觀祭的詳細記載下來作成論文寄同英國發表，喚醒本國人的注意。接着他發現了非洲中部一條最大的河’名四參比西河，幷往南直走到好望角。這幾决的經歷中，他已經大體上把非洲南北打通，他的報告在英國受無數人的歡迎和注意。地理學上根據他的報告改變非洲的地圖，植物學，動物學上也增加了許多新的資料。李汶斯呑的書到處銷行，也算不淸一共印了多少版，他所得的錢眞可使他安坐在倫敦去作大富翁了。可是他並不理會這種享福的事，他把錢拿去自造一條輪船，索性不去傳敎了，專門在非洲作探險事業。在探險之中他曾一次被獅子吃掉了一條左臂，被非洲蚊子圍攻，幾乎逃不出命來；好幾次因為欽食不好成了痢疾，至於發燒瘧疾，更是家常便飯，不等什麼。無論受着傷，害了病，他的實志一點都不屈服。病一養好，他仍然往森密危險的地方走去，定要把非洲腹地完全弄淸楚了才干休！</p>
<p>他開始又由海岸直接向，內部推進，和幾個土人走到了羅安達，從那裏他進到了底洛洛湖，順參比西河而下發現了世界聞名的維多利亞大瀑布，以及非洲中心的大湖尼亞沙湖。為了要把這湖的周圍地帶和詳情調查清楚，他令船在湖中，自已一人登陸步行，把所見的詳詳情細記載下來。最後他突破了蚊子的圍攻，穿透了參比西河而達到了牠的海口。在那裏他迎着了他的太太。</p>
<p>現在非洲中部已經都由他發現，只有潭子尼亞湖與尼亞沙湖中間的一片地方還待訪查，這在他原不是什麼很困難的事，所以他把這地帶找得之後，就開始去探窮尼羅河的河源。</p>
<p>他的第三次探索的以尼亞沙湖為起點。由此西進，發現了潭于尼亞湖的南端，發現了羅安家地帶以及班韋路湖。在這一次旅行中他遇了許多獵取奴隸，販賣奴隸的人，使他非常憤恨。然而他不久又得到了安慰，因為在烏夷夷地方他遇着了他的好友斯丹烈。這位朋友陪著他共同旅行，他們經過了許多困難，最後到底到達了潭干尼亞湖的北端，非洲中部的探險到底完成，開關了一大片人　不到的為蚊　毒蛇猛跌所盤据的密境！</p>
<p>我們說過，李汶斯吞雖然發現非洲，解决了地理上非洲的奧秘，但他不肯就此滿足，他還要去探究尼羅河了，他的身體因為缺少營養和休息，又被　蛇咬得利審，已是十分廋弱。在這末次尼羅河的探險中他竟染上了很烈性的痢疾，死於路中。同路的人無綸是白人黑人都同心哀悼，痛哭失聲。他們把他遺留下來的文稿器具，連同他的遺體保存得非常周密，將他們送回英國，遺體安葬在威斯敏斯特大寺院中</p>
<p>李汶斯呑一生在探索考察中三十年如一日。他的足跡由好望角直到了赤道子，由大西洋岸走到了印度洋，幾幾乎走徧了一半的非洲大陸。在歷史上所有在非洲探險的人沒有第二個像他這樣年代長久，成績偉大，沒有一個人如他這樣的鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已的。李汶斯呑眞是個偉大的人物呵。</p>

<h3 id="c230">死魂靈 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 得中</p>
<p>一　作者的生活及死魂靈的背景</p>
<p>十九世紀方才開頭，在烏克蘭，便產了這個震動歐洲各國，奠定俄國寫實主義的果戈里。俄國整個的寫實主義的系統中，作家們莫不嬗遞的繼承着果戈里的衣鉢。</p>
<p>他產生在一個貴族的家里，父親是一個愛好文學戲劇的貴族，母親是一個柔和慈善，篤信宗敎的女人。他受了父親的影響，對於文學和戲劇，發生了極大的熱心，以至使他一度要投身俳優生活。他受了母親的影響，腦中深深的刻畫上天堂的幸福，地獄的苦痛，和末日的裁判等等，他也成了一個虔誠的宗教信仰者。這造成他晚年的悲劇。</p>
<p>當他父親死去以後，他離開了小俄羅斯的故鄉，走到比得堡。雖然，他要做俳優而不成，做了個小官吏，他自己父感到不合興趣而辭職，但是他却在比得堡開拓了眼界，認識了當時俄國的社會。</p>
<p>十九世紀的俄國社會，是怎麼一個樣子？</p>
<p>那是西歐工業資本主義正在發達的時候，民主思想如巨浪樣的捲進歐洲的各國，遠處在北邊的俄國，也同樣的受了這巨浪的沫花。但在當時的俄國中，不論農奴制度是怎樣殘酷的盛行，不論政治是如何的黑暗和紊亂，尼古拉皇帝是極力在壓抑着全國的民主思想，政府明令禁止全國討論關於帝國的政治和社會的問題。在另一方面，他又極力為農奴制度做護符，企圖延長它的命運。但事實是不可掩滅的，封建貴族制度遇到了資本主義制度迎頭打來，是無論如何難以取勝的，於是俄國的封建貴族制度開始發生了崩潰的象徵。</p>
<p>就這樣，產生了果戈里的偉大著作「死魂靈」。</p>
<p>二死魂靈的故事的梗槪</p>
<p>死魂靈的故事的梗概，是這樣：一個窮貴族乞乞科夫，要想以收買死去了的農奴的名字，以為發財大道。當時俄國的戶口調查的登記，是每隔十年到二十年的期間埤舉行一次的。但在這一次戶口調查之前，地主向政府為他的農奴所納的人頭稅，是依照上次戶口調查時的名額而納的，縱然因了幾年之隔，那些農奴已經有許多死亡了，但政府並不承認便沒有了這些名額。乞乞科夫便牧買這些在法律上仍然活着，而實際上已死去了的農奴。這對各個地主，當然是非常有利的事，因為他為他們减去了那種無益的負擔，所以乞乞科夫的計畫，是進行得非常順利，以極少的代價，而收買到大批的死農奴的名字；甚至有些地主，情願無條件的將那些贈送給他。</p>
<p>乞乞科夫帶着一個僕役彼得爾希加，一個馬夫綏里方，到了省會NN市的一家旗館里住下，他聞始了全城官吏的拜訪，由於官吏的拜訪，他認識了NN市附近的大地主。於是他開始了他的工作。他坐在馬車里，綏里方駕馭着，在鄉間東西南北的跑着，他見到了感傷無聊的瑪尼羅夫，他見到了頑固的死板的科羅皤契加老太太，他又見到了吹牛的流氓樣的羅士特來夫，奸巧的梭巴開維支，和慳吝的潑留希金。他從這些人手里收買到號稱「十萬盧布」的農奴，他立刻被全城人所尊為「百萬富翁」</p>
<p>他有了這許多死的農奴，他又計畫着在消律地省或赫爾生省，買許多極賤的荒地，再履行法律上的手續，將死農奴們移住到那里去。然後把他們在國家的「救濟局」里抵押，每個農奴可以抵押二百盧布，那麼，他立刻可以得到二十萬盧布了。</p>
<p>因為農奴呌做「魂靈」，所以死的農奴，呌做「死魂靈」</p>
<p>三　死魂靈所反映的社會</p>
<p>克魯泡特金說：「果戈里的主要作品是死魂靈。這是一本幾乎沒有情節的小說，或者寧可說是具有極端簡單的情節的。」正因了這樣，讀者隨着書中的主角，跑遍了尼古拉一世時代的社會，而認識了那社會的整體。</p>
<p>除了幾個乞乞科夫的交易的對手，每人有一種以外的性格，作者的筆尖，還掃到了社會的各層。紳士們有這樣的藝術，「對着蓄有」一百個魂靈的地主說話，和對那蓄有三百個的，完全兩樣。」對富有者極力阿諛。閨秀們則說着「文雅」的話，每日討論者衣飾的間題，追求着富人。農奴是勞苦的工作着，當主人打駡的時候，他是筆直的站在那里。皇家的軍官，是酗酒賭傳跳舞嫖娼的能手，一點也見不到軍隊的紀律，國家官吏是一羣膽小如鼠的傢伙，遇到一點什麼事，立刻手忙脚亂，張皇失措；而收受賄賂，他們却有豐富的經驗；法庭是黑暗到底的；會議是浪費而無結果的。這一切，作者都刻畫出一幅深刻的輪廓。</p>
<p>果戈里寫此書時，是抱了這樣的態度：「我為什麼該守秘密呢？除了作者，誰還有義務，來宣告神聖的眞實呢？你們怕深刻的探究的眼光射到你們身上來，你們不敢用這眼光來看對象，你們喜歡瞎了眼睛，毫不思索，在一切之前溜過。」他又說：「我的職務還要簡單而切近：就是要人都思索，而不是我獨自首先來思索。我的範圍是魂靈，是人生强大的，堅實的東西。所以我的事務和創作，也應該强大和堅實。」</p>
<p>是的，死魂靈是一本小說，同時，也是一本歷史，它有着史筆所記載不及的記載。</p>
<h3 id="c231">評「短劍集」 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 明仁</p>
<p>文化生活社最近出版了鄭振鐸先生的「短劍集」，大部分是鄭先生近年來關於中國文學上的論文，共分上下兩輯，包含十二篇作品，要算他繼續「中編文學論集」及　佝償集」而作的一部論文集</p>
<p>鄭先生過去對於中國文學上的努力，日不可泯滅的。單就他的「文學大綱」各「插圖本中國文學史」而論，已是近年來　負盛譽的鉅著，所以這本論文集，也同樣值得注意。</p>
<p>開首一　「詞的有在問探」，他反對一般詞的解放運動，結論是：、「如果有人要寫些新的長短句來自己唱唱的話，共應當走的路，只有兩條：（一）是自作曲，卽他為一個製曲家，曾自己作譜，創造若干新的歌曲來。（二）是採用了民間的歌曲或西洋的曲譜來做切切實實的「塡」的工作。」這是有志創造新體歌曲一條多麼光明燦爛的道路，和最近朱右白先生在「中國詩的新途徑」中提倡「唐詩復興」，都有同樣的理由，和一味商唱「復古」者，大不相同。</p>
<p>其中「標點古書與提倡舊文學」和「向翻卽古書者提議」二篇，一是反對時下標點無益而有害的古書，一是建議翻印古畫做的工作，說得極為透澈明瞭，是從事出版界的人，所應當知道的事。</p>
<p>此外如「元代公案劇發。生的原因及其特質」和「凈與丑」二篇，都是鄭先生最近研究戲劇的貢獻，其中有許多精確的考證，是未經人道的。</p>
<p>自然，這並不是一部絕無可議的書，其中有一部分意思，我便未敢贊同。如「中國文學遺產問題」說：「我們要放大眼光，在實用主義和個人主義以外的作品去揀，我們不需要供奉文學，也不需要純以個人的富貴功名為中心的牢騷文學，我們所需要的，是更偉大更具有永久生命的作品的。』我們看了這一大篇，究竟什麼才是「更偉大更具有永久生命的作品」？鄭先生並未明白的指示出來，僅僅舉了幾個西洋的例子，但他的在「中國文學研究者向那裏去」中說：「尚未成為一般人研究的目標之「變文」，「諸宮調」，「彈詞」，「鼓詞」等等的文體，那一種不是値得我們開始去注意……我們並不否認唐詩宋詞的重要與偉大，但表彰了「變文」「諸宮調」，並不就是壓低了詩詞的身份，這並不是有你沒我的敵國相爭的事，而只是發現了，添加了若干偉大的著作，使唐宋文壇更為光彩燦斕耳。　大概這裏所說的「變文」「諸宮調」，「彈詞」「鼓詞」等等，便是鄭先生所指為更偉大更具有永久生命的作品了，但這種變文與諸宮調等等，區區也會涉獵一些，都是充滿着封建意識，和今日鴛鴦蝴蝶派的東西，正復相似。所謂更偉犬更具有永久生命一曆，恕我未便承認。</p>
<p>「文學的繁簡」一篇說：『我們如果要文壇走上了大道，要有偉大的名著出現，那必須提倡一個繁宇…簡便是陋，便是苟，要文章寫得不苟不陋，那必定得用心在繁字上用工夫。』這裏的意思，已經明的提倡一個繁宇，但他又說到：『如會就修辭一方面說來，「辭達而已矣』，「不論繁與簡也」，如何能够成一篇沒有疵病的文章，那是有許多條件的，决不能以「繁」「簡」二字來判定好壞。』那麼，文字的好壞，與繁簡本沒有多大關係，這和前面提倡「繁」字的話，正相矛盾。本來文字的繁簡問題，我認為繁簡都各有所當，應該看每一篇文字的情形酌定，有時因然需要「繁」的，但有時也需要「簡」的，正不可一味拘呢。如班固做司馬相如傳，至五百餘字，不覺共繁：而書經中「爾惟風，下民惟草」二句，雖寥寥數字，郤包含極深長的意思，並不覺其簡，這些例，前人筆記中已經說得很多，所以我們提倡「繁」字和提倡『簡字」，都是偏頗之論</p>
<p>我批評的話就此結束，最後我認為這本集子，雖然並不是絕無可識，但總是値得參考的書，願介紹於從事中國文學者之前。</p>

<p>— 鍾怡</p>
<p>因為中國的古藉大都是卷帙浩繁，假如不指明篇名雖然是曉得書名，而結果仍會是一無所得；譬如「一切」一條，倘若不注明是史記李斯傳，那你必得要翻徧了一百三十篇全書，讀完了五十二萬多字的全文，到那時，或許你還不能尋到，而白費了時間和精力。有人說，這是因為中國古書素引之類，還不完全的原故。可是我要說，有了這一部書，一切索引之類，大可不必再禍棗災梨。</p>
<p>據報紙上所刋登的舊辭，値得介紹的，有：</p>
<p>（一）三五—這一個抽象的辭頭，他一共引出了八種不同的意思。有指三正五行的，有指三辰五星的，有指三王五伯的，有指三田五藏的，眞可算是廣博。</p>
<p>（二）爰書—這是比較冷僻的一種辭頭，他解釋引證都很詳盡。</p>
<p>（三）選體</p>
<p>（四）四六</p>
<p>（五）拗體討—這類文學上的舊名詞，有許多是僅、僅乎散見在各種新詩話或小的筆記上面，而不見於聖經賢傳的，他這一類名詞的搜得，也不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>現在再談到他所提出的單字。</p>
<p>他所提出的單字是「　」「唐」兩個。這兩個字的來源，有周禮和鄭注，釋文引干注，廣雅，禮記，說文，說文引經例辨等書；而他們的意義是：　的本義為久屋朽木，引申義是朽木臭，要奧，再引申而為病，而庮和他更是兩字相同。在這裏，個舉康熙字典來做例，證明以前辭書的解證琉略，這的確是這一部書的進步。現在我不憚麻煩，把康熙字典和辭海這兩個宇所解注的，抄在下面，以便讀者的比較：</p>
<p>（一）庮—說文：「久屋朽木也。」周禮天官內饗：「牛夜鳴則庮。」注：「鄭司農曰：庮朽本臭也。」（康熙字典）</p>
<p>（一）久屋朽木也，見說文。段注二「久屋而後有朽木」（二）朽木臭也。周禮天官內饗：「牛夜唱則庮」注引鄭司農云：「庮朽木臭也」孫詒讓正義：「釋文引干注云：病也。廣雅釋詁云：庮病也。庮庮字亦通。說文引周禮文而釋之云；「臭如朽木」謂肉味變也，味變為病，故干注訓庮為病。又禮內則：「牛夜鳴則」。注：「庮惡臭也。」蓋渾言之。（辭海）</p>
<p>這兩書一比較，康熙字典所解，確是太簡了。（三）庮—博雅：「庮病也」。又集韵：「久屋朽木臭」。周禮天官內饗：「牛夜鳴則　「注「庮朽木臭也」（康熙字典）</p>
<p>病也，見廣雅。王念孫疏證：「周禮天官內變：牛夜鳴則庮。鄭衆注云：「庮朽木臭也。」釋文引干寳注云：庮病也。與庮通參閱庮字注</p>
<p>康熙字典所稱博雅卽廣雅，此誤一。周禮原文作庮不作庮，而此作庮，此誤二。這兩點，辭海都能改正過來，也很不錯。</p>
<p>這一部書還沒出版，這裏所引出的，常然是他的精華所在；然而照此類推，這部書想還可以。我特地在此介紹，希望中華書局不要辜負了我們的希望，延期出版，或是名實不符。眞的。在這學藝進展，人事遷移，新陳代謝，瞬息萬變，語言的孳乳演遞，絕塵而馳，一日千里的時候，我們的文壇上，眞需要一部理想的辭書，來救濟我們的飢荒。</p>

<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>所謂淋菌伐克辛治療者，即將病原菌在試騐管中，使喚之發育，殺之而注射於皮下，以期發生對於淋菌之免疫物，但無絕對的免疫性。其種類可分為二，其一即從患者自家淋菌而掣成伐克辛，稱為自家伐克辛，其二稱為異種伐克辛，即以他人淋菌製成者也。就中以自家伐克辛注射功效較大，不過亦僅能用於急性淋之初起，而功效不確，想伐克辛之療法，許多淋病患者，必有經過注射而知其為落伍之療法也。</p>
<p>然今有許多只知侔利之妄人，因見德國彼得氏所發明之抗淋免菌劑之「克淋儂」，對於各期淋病，確着根治之效。於是異想天開，妄用他人淋菌製成伐克辛內服藥，以欺妄病家，謂有如何功效。試想淋病本為淋菌所傳染，又安可以他人之淋菌，作為內服藥，豈非自殺乎？然因殘忍之市儈，利用報紙以為鼓吹，故受害者甚眾，有居大西路之伍君，亦患淋病，曾外用伐克辛注射多針無效，後乃惑於廣吿，誤購伐克辛製劑之內服藥，未幾心中憒憒作嘔，尿道中膿液忽然停止，睪丸，精囊，精系等均被淋菌所占，其粘膜上之淋菌，亦密佈無間，顯係該劣藥引毒入內之證，心臟亦有中毒模樣，故伍君來余處治療時，神智不淸，除行手術急救外，卽投以克淋特效藥「克淋儂」，以消炎抗淋殺菌，經過月餘之治療，始轉危為安。且獲根治，伍君自悔孟浪，不該誤服淋菌之製劑云。</p>

<p>— 金月仁醫師</p>
<p>婦女之腰酸帶下，其身體必虧，蓋此患多由子宮或尿道中發炎，以致穢液下注，其色黃白，或雜有血絲，不急事補救，則子宮附近之生殖器官，均受影響，月經不調，小腹膨賬，久婚不孕者，亦多見於白帶下之婦女，其根治之法，不可不雙方兼顧。</p>
<p>關於此病之對症療法，必須用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以排除白帶，而防局部之腐爛，更以「補女容」為內服藥，以調整月經，旺盛血液，無不於數星期中切實治愈。惟有因淋病傳染而患白帶者，可兼服「克淋儂」以消炎殺菌，則其功效尤偉矣。用法每於臨睡前取「陰道片」一片插入膣道深部。次晨洗去即得。</p>

<p>淋病瀰漫中之福音</p>
<p>淋毒之瀰漫性，較梅毒為甚，在許多大都市中，百分之八十左右之男子中，俱患淋病，因此對於淋病之療法，亦日新而月異，然許多頑固之醫家，猶墨守陳法，如伐克辛療法，現在稍具時代之醫家，莫不認為落伍之療法，以其功效不確，且副作用甚大也。</p>
<p>一般在急性期間之淋病，從前多行伐克辛注射，然因不能根本治愈，反使轉成慢性。因此淋病之瀰漫範圍益大，故多棄置不用，已一致改用「克淋儂」之內服藥矣。考「克淋儂」之特色有三，一服「克淋儂」後，其殺菌效用，直接發生於病灶，毫不損傷健全組織，二服「克淋儂」能旺盛全體細菌抗淋免疫作用，不論全身傳染，及局部淋菌，均能一鼓受擒，而能達到「除淋必盡」之微妙作用，三許多殺菌藥，副作用甚大，服後往往作嘔，而「克淋儂」則絕對無此等不良現象，「克淋儂」旣具此三長，宜為風行全球，而為各著名醫家所樂用，實為淋病瀰漫於人類中之幸福也。至於婦女有淋毒性白帶患者，則除內服「克淋儂」外，宜兼用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除局部之白帶，則內外兼顧，相得益彰，收效更速矣。</p>

<p>一誤再誤—一誤手淫，再誤服春藥</p>
<p>所謂發育不全者，即身體矮小，面色萎黃，下部陰莖，渺小如兒童，多由於患者少年時誤犯手淫，　喪其內分泌機能而起。宜行臟器療法，以旺盛內分泌機能，以促性腺之發育。</p>
<p>然患者，往往貪圖近利，益增病患。有寓靜安寺路梁君，少年時即好犯手淫，致身體與生殖器發育均不健全，且有遺精陰莖勃起力不全等症，嗣見報載有生殖一類名詞之藥片，詎購服之後，僅昂奮一時，旋即萎頓，實為春藥也。而梁君不悟，貪一時之功，仍續服不已。服未半月，雖進大量此類劣藥，仍不見效，且精神尤感疲乏，身體消瘦，頭重失眠，有如癆病狀，始急就余處治療，診之，此病全由手淫與誤服春藥而來，乃投以德國荷爾蒙製劑之「補體康」，前後約服七八瓶，內分泌已見旺盛，而促生殖系組織之强化，而發育日趨於健全之境。遂獲已全愈矣。至如女子發育不全，月經遲至，久婚不姙等　用「補女容」。因「補體康」與「補女容」二藥，俱係勇健動物之荷爾蒙所製成，故效力宏偉也。</p>

<p>夏令最習見之症候，以心胸苦悶為最，幾於人皆有此，但常人每多忽略。實則許多慢性胃病，多成於此際。患者食减胃呆，消化不良，大便秘結，已多，以「强胃精」昂盛食欲，淸導腸部，最為對症。</p>

<p>傷風為呼吸器各病之源　氣管炎不治之危險</p>
<p>咯痰無論稠厚薄白，咳嗽無論急激輕微，其為氣管炎之疾患則一。因炎症而致氣管痙攣者，小之則為孩童百日咳，大之則為老年哮喘（亦有心臟性喘息）。若窮氣管炎之久咳頑痰的來源，蓋多由傷風延宕所誤。</p>

<p>單純色素製劑無全治淋濁之力　必須參用白血球療法以亢增喰菌作用</p>

<p>要之，治淋之唯一方法，只能施用提凈之色素，因色素品質駁雜，提製不純，即有敗胃與危害生命之虞，然一經提煉，原有强大藥效，必須輔以蛋白體，始能充分發揮，而奏偉着之除淋抗菌確騐。</p>
<p>色素提製手續，只有德國彼得博士之方法最為可靠，因其器械係　自己所發明，而其提凈之色素又侶合蛋白體以增旺人體白血球，喚起全身之抗毒除淋滅菌作用，無論局部及全身各處病灶，即得根本肅淸，此藥即近今風行各國之「克淋儂」，為治男女一切急慢性白濁及合併症與尿道傳染疾患之特效藥，力足而性王道，實淋藥之權威也。</p>

<p>石灰質在化學上，也呌做鈣，有强化身体的功力，供给肺部组织之補助。肺部痨灶的空洞，因钙質的塡補而得彌縫，結核菌失了根據地，不久即可歸于消滅。可是要牠死亡，須經過一年以上的時間，所以雖在服鈣質治愈後，也仍不能全然忘記療養。因為結核菌賦性最强　，撲殺很不易，而染者又多係靑年，感罹之後，肌肉漸削，所謂形存氣亡，不過是活死人罷了。因此，凡有肺病嫌疑之人，即宜速服以鈣製劑「補肺拿爾」防治之。肺病第一例：陳正康，廿三歲，學界。</p>
<p>症候：患者咳嗽兩年，夜間為甚，喀痰極多，成貨幣狀沉降于器底。潮熱血痰，心悸失眠。食思缺損，身瘦。</p>
<p>診療：診斷為第二期肺癆。治與腎上核精注射，效力未見。乃投服「補肺拿爾」補給鈣質，淸除癆咳，而止血除痰。同時囑服「補體康」旺增體力，增進榮養（女用「補女容」調經健體），並治失眠衰弱等（有遺精時服「育精片」），即奏美滿全治之效！患者精神暢適，經過五個月，體重大增！</p>

<p>欲解除此種痛苦，當鎭攝情興奮，鞏固精關，可向永安中西購服「育精片」以治之。同時設法挽救性神經衰弱及失眠健忘眩暈症，故以服「補體康」為首。切勿妄服他種生殖腺一類霸烈製劑之春藥，飲　止渴！</p>

<p>淋菌性膀胱炎的時候，後尿道炎也同時存在，所以這個時候的症狀，就是後尿道炎和膀胱炎共同發生的症狀，大致如尿意頻數，放尿時候的疼痛，尿溷濁，發熱，食慾不振，全身　和等等，倘然是純粹的急性膀胱炎，病人晝夜間最少每二小時要小便一次，重症的時候，小便時間，更加短縮，幾有時刻非小便不可的狀態，疼痛在膀胱的時候，也很激烈，尤以小便的時候和小便終了的時候，疼痛更甚，痛的部位，大都在下腹部，會陰部，倘使後尿道炎和膀胱炎並存的時候，全部尿道都覺疼痛，並且有時放散到肛門，此外還有尿的淋漓和小便完結後的排泄血液出來的症像，這樣的膀胱炎，最近有一種「滅殺淋」發明，經中央衛生署化騐合格，幷發給第三〇一號成藥證書頗有主治之效，蓋「滅殺淋」之有效成分，能直達膀胱尿道等部，收殺菌鎭痛消炎之功，大約服二三瓶後，有漸漸痊愈之能，若　藥劑，或不適當之治療，能變成慢性膀胱炎之危險，那時候危險的程度，也很難預測，重則竟有死亡之虞呢，</p>

<h3 id="c251">减低利息 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>最近本埠經濟新聞裏有一段是關於「减低利息」的，新聞的影響很像並不大，沒有許多人去注意，可是因為這裏關係到的範圍很大，尤其是對於存放欵兩方面的聯繋，更其値得注意。事情的開始是為了財政部訓令本埠銀錢兩業：為維護工商業起見，而應减低對工商業放欵的利息，以資救濟。這是着眼在救濟工商業，而主張减低放欵利息的。然而，這個訓令在銀錢兩業方面，那是很費躊躇的。最後他們呈覆財政部，以為：「我國為農業國家，農民佔百分之八十以上，各種商品全賴農民購買，工商業不過從間取利，故農村經濟之興衰，關係工商業之榮枯至鉅。」關於這個，他們也認為「發展工商，以培養農村」是一個「首要」的問題。不過，「减低放欵利息，救濟工商，尚非治本之方。」他們的理由是「减低放欵利息，必須先减低存欵利息，不然，金融界勢必無業可營。」由此，這一個减低利息問題，便成為目前金融界的一件頗値得注意的問題了。</p>
<p>中國的工商業不發達，他的原因當然是多方面的。資本不足，很容易給大企業者併呑，當然也是一個「首要」的原因。而對這「首要」原因的救濟，减低銀和或錢荘的放欵利息，使小工商業得以周轉，當然也是一個「首要」的補救辦法。然而，這補救辦法，正如銀錢兩業在呈覆所說的「尚非治本之方」一樣，是不夠的。關於「治本之方」，銀錢兩業雖然沒有明白指出，但我們如果明白中國工商業的最最「首要」最近的原因是由於某帝國主義的私貨霸佔市塲，和一般憑藉帝國主義勢力的買力階級所操縱下的大企業傾軋小工商業，那我們便很明顯地知道「治本之方」在什麽地方了。同時，這種「治本之方」，我們很高興，現在上海的各界聞人已在實行了，廣大的檢私運動不就是許多方法中較為切實的一個嗎？</p>
<p>其次，談到减低存欵利息這一個銀錢兩業的主張，我們也認為不十分妥當。這理由，銀錢兩業的明眼人已看得很明白了。據他們表示：至於「减低存欵利息的結果，人民之現欵，恐被外商銀行吸收，國內資金恐將有逃避之虞」。這是一個很老實的說法。大企業呑併小企業，這是一件很平常的事，尤其是在當前這麽的一個社會裏。何况，還是處在半殖民地地位的我們這個國家裏，無數睜眉怒目的豺狼，尤其是我們的素來主張「經濟提携」的「親隣」，他們是經常地窺俟着我們偶一的疏忽，他們便張開了天大的血口，冽開了狼齒在狡笑的了。</p>
<p>現在，這個减低利息的問題還沒有看見下文，但是我們相信從這問題所牽引的各方面，經過此次减低利息的一番研討以後，恐怕會給大家一個新的印象吧。由此，我們更確信：在半殖民地的國家裏，沒有一件事，甚至很微小的事，是不和現在的帝國主義侵略上有關聯的。同時也更證明：除了爭取眞正的獨立解放，是再沒有出路了。</p>
<h3 id="c252">我國的養蜂養兎事業（下） <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>（本報特稿）兎，在我國一向被視為是無甚出息的家畜，在鄉村里除了少數人家飼養着一兩封玩賞之外，便不會有人去想到提倡的。可是近來已經給一般畜牧家們，注意起來，像最近的甘純權和馮煥文兩先生，他們可說是提倡養兎事業的最力者：並且甘先生為了養兔事業，還曾經特地赴日本去考察和研究過。——現在甘馮兩先生正在籌備一個兎毛織物廠。</p>
<p>兎有毛用種，皮用種，肉用種，皮肉用種，供玩食肉等五種；其種的來源是英意美荷等四國，至於我國的草兎及野兎却均不適於飼養。</p>
<p>毛用的有盎古拉，其毛長約三吋以上的，可紡毛線，織造各種上等毛織品，較短的可製貴重呢帽。皮用的種類很多，比較貴重的有力克司（Lex），分白色，鋼灰，黑色，　灰等，因其毛短而濃密，保溫力大，又不易脫毛。其餘如狐兎，貂兎等也很貴重。肉用種有大型弗利密西，及改良肉用種——係用兩種西洋種交配，皮亦潔白有用。</p>
<p>我國的兎子最重不過三四磅，而此種兎子却有七八磅，甚至十來磅重者。</p>
<p>除了兎毛可以製造各種上等毛織品，貴重的兎皮可以做婦女的大衣，或領頭，中國野兎或普通白兎，皮旣不大，毛又易脫，每張僅三四角，而力克司種皮旣大，質又高，在日本每張可値四五元。</p>
<p>兎肉的銷路，在日本及意大利等國，多用以製罐供給軍隊；或製成肉鬆，因兎味鮮美，滋養豐富，兎肉所含的成分分析在下面：</p>
<p>蛋白質　19.7——91％</p>
<p>脂肪　8.5——16％</p>
<p>水分　62——70％</p>
<p>鑛鹽　1％</p>
<p>每兎每年消耗食料，大約一元至一元半；至於其生產，毛用種每兎每年產毛約半磅，以每磅十元計算，可値五元。力克司皮每張硝好値洋二元至五元，肉兎每兎五斤至十斤，每斤價約二角，如製為肉鬆則利益加倍。</p>
<p>平常，兎子每月蕃殖一次，為其健康起見應加以限制，一年蕃殖三次最為適當，而春夏冬三季為兎子生產的適宜時期。但是管理，一個人可管理毛用種一百五十至二百五十頭，皮肉用種二百至四百頭。</p>
<p>食料方面，其分配為大麥五倍，豆餅兩倍，麩皮一倍，食鹽少許，冬天可餵以豆腐渣和麩皮，每天早晨一次。</p>
<p>綠物——阿而反反，金花菜，紫雲英，（以上三種新鮮或乾燥皆適用），甘籃，兎耳草，羊奶草，（上海附近很多），黃蘿葡，馬鈴薯，靑麥，靑草。此種綠物的餵飼方法，每天兩次，每次半磅，混合物一握。</p>
<p>關於預防疾病，第一須注意舍內乾燥，空氣流通，淸潔，冬季需要溫暖，夏季却應該凉爽。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c253">速寫像 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>偶然整理書架，在一册舊的日記簿裏翻到一張我的速寫像；說是我的速寫像，那是祗有畫的人和被畫的我兩個人能夠懂得的。那張速寫像簡單地描着一個面部輪廓，沒有五官，架一付大眼鏡，就算是我的標幟了。不過那畫的人是値得紀念的，那張速寫像在日記簿裏藏了許多時候，現在一翻到它，我馬上會回憶起那畫的人和那個晚上。</p>
<p>現在應該說得明白一點，那畫的人是我的表妹，是我母親的姪女。我的母親死得很早，父親沒有滿週年又娶了一位母親，我的表妹呢，甚至在沒有學會走路的時候，已經呌着我舅父的第二個妻子做媽媽了。雖然我的父親和舅父都是愛護孩子的，但是孩子們更需要的是母愛。俗謂「隔層肚皮隔重山」，我們所需要的母愛是無法取償的，由於這點關係，我們親密起來。不過親密也祗是親密而已，從十多歲時候直到她論嫁的那一年，我們甚至沒有一秒鐘的時候想到過我們是在戀愛着。</p>
<p>那一年夏天，她到我家來，住了一個多月，在她要回家的上一天晚上，我們從竹林裏納凉回房，她突然憂　地說我們今後沒有這樣日子過了。自從我們親密往來以後，從來沒有什麽困難的問題可以使我們不快活的，我們互相安慰，我們互相自尋快活，而且我們的親父並不禁止我們，那個突如其來的消息，在她住了一個多月後才說出來。眞是太奇突了。</p>
<p>天氣已將近凉了，窗外有早期的秋蟲在花牆間啁啾着，我半天沒有想到應該問她的理由，她伏在窗前的書桌上，拿着一枝鉛筆在紙上隨意塗抹，最後寫了四個大字「我要嫁了」。</p>
<p>知道是她要嫁的消息，我一點也不驚奇，那是女孩兒家比較男子佔便宜的地方，她可以從她丈夫那裏收回所期望着的像母愛一樣的愛情。我想說出我心中的話來祝福她，但是很奇怪的那天晚上我已缺乏了那種勇氣，大家都是默默地。至今想起來，那晚上我們或許是在戀愛着了。</p>
<p>她臨走的時候，在紙上畫了那個速寫像。我就作為一件紀念品似的藏在我的日記簿裏，現在紙張都變成灰黃色了</p>
<p>我的孩子剛在我身旁翻幾册畫報，是我手裏的畫，他搶了過去，對那付大眼鏡看了再看看我面上的眼鏡，他聰明地說：「爸爸」。</p>
<p>「像媽媽」我問他。</p>
<p>「都有眼鏡。」那是他的理由。</p>
<p>我微笑着把那速寫像仍珍重地藏在日記簿裏，心裏想着現在多一個人知道那幅是「我」的速寫像了。</p>
<h3 id="c254">在靑島 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 馬吉風</p>
<p>懷着顆高興的心，我坐着膠濟車到靑島了。靑島是個美地方，在夏天她更美，到那裏玩一下該是如何地快樂，我老早就希望着能見到她，她在海的懷抱裏呵，就像要會見愛人一樣，我帶着我的行李——一個不到二斤重的包袱，心裏滿裝了神秘的情緖，倚着欄杆貪婪地望着海。小靑島像畫面一樣地座落在海裏；海水是個永不安靜的玩皮孩子，她跳動着，翻起着浪花，　上沙灘：發着笑聲。晚霞盡抹在光闊的天上，人們還在留戀在海底懷抱裏。欄杆旁邊的長椅上已經滿坐了乘凉的人；我在迷茫地睜大了眼睛瞧。</p>
<p>——我該怎樣呢？</p>
<p>我摸着包袱，包袱裏的一塊多錢。我想家裏的爸爸媽媽來——他們不願我</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>開家，就像想到我這次出來，不是到青島玩玩就回去的。我悵惘了。黃昏的色網伸張開的當兒，我彳亍地離開了海濱，找那離這裏不遠的小敎堂。</p>
<p>我就住到那裏了。牧師是我父親的朋友，並且他認識我，小的時候很喜歡我。懷着不安的心情，我寫信給一位朋友了。我向他要錢，要到上海來的路費。</p>
<p>信寄出去的下午，我就在牧師的桌上發現爸爸寄給他的信：我慌了——家裏已經讓他注意我了！信裏邊這是用希臘文寫的，我是不認得的。我立刻又寫了一封信，結那位寄錢來的朋友，——錢寄膠濟日報去，交×××先生轉我，我在這裏已經被監視着了。</p>
<p>果然料想的不錯，吃晚飯的時候，牧師就向我說了：</p>
<p>『擬什麼時候回去呢？這裏也沒什麼好玩的！』</p>
<p>『四五天吧！』</p>
<p>他聽了我的話，裝着很自然的神氣。我心裏笑起來——我知道你喜的什麽藥。</p>
<p>『年頭不好，在這裏鐵路上找個事也不容易，我看你還是早回去，有什麽事時我寫信呌你來，省得家裏不放心，掛念着你！你不是想在鐵路上找個事幹幹嘛？』</p>
<p>我搖了搖頭。他心裏明白，我心裏也明白。見到面他就扯拉起這些來，聽了使人頭痛。我不願意見他，每天總是溜到街上去消磨時間。</p>
<p>第二天我跑到雲南路去找一位朋友，打算從那裏搬開。可是這位朋友的地址我記不清了，我把雲南路上相仿的數目都找了一下，也沒有找到。在失望的鞭子打在心頭上，挺着念的當節，我想到了一個法子——到公安局裏去查戶籍冊子。這個方法我想沒人用過。在最末的分駐所裏我查到了。欣慰着在失望的心頭上，我高興地找去了——可是他已經在二三天前，到北平去了。說不出的悲哀壓到心頭上，沒精打彩地在遙長的雲南路上走了回來。</p>
<p>沿着光滑的柏油路走，在那富有異國情調的酒店，商店的旁邊走過，我就像是失却了靈魂的人一樣。什麽業惹不起我的注意，好象什麽也沒在發生——穿了奇怪的衣服，丑角的帽子，作了日本貨大學眼藥，臭虫粉，胃活的廣告，大吹大打地在身旁走過，不是遞給我一張廣告單的時候，我也不瞧他們一眼的。</p>
<p>黃昏，是情侶們的時間：成對地在海邊像穿梭一樣地走。高興的臉，喜笑的話聲，使我寂寞——這不是我該居住的地方呵。走走看着路燈照了的自己的身影，聽着海的鬧聲，感到太悲哀了。停住脚，對着『吉士牌』烟的大廣告，瞧起來——那上邊是畫着一個漂亮的女人，笑着，看着人：我笑了，把一切壓在心頭的都忘掉了。停留一大會，臨走還頻頻回過頭去望，連路都不看了。</p>
<p>第四天我就從報館裏接到那朋友的信了，我高興，就像一個長硬了翅膀要飛出窠去一樣。他寄給我十五塊錢。</p>
<p>『我怎樣從那裏走呢？』</p>
<p>船的日期我早就打聽好了，——當天，就有船，我把船票買好了。</p>
<p>到牧師那裏的時候，他正在睡午覺，高興的我了不的，我把早就寫好的信留在桌上，把他的夾被也包在小包袱裏，悄悄地溜了出來。</p>
<p>坐在洋車上時刻地回望着——追來了吧！心裏在緊縮着。踏上『青島丸』的甲板我才舒了口氣。望着『大港』裏的海水，和緊接着的天，輕輕地說：</p>
<p>『再會了，青島！』</p>

<p>是的，「中秋月」是分外的明媚，有錢的人家在這個分外明媚的中秋月夜裏；在狂歡的喝着酒，賞着月，跳着舞，唱着歌，和咀嚼着應時的月餅兒，幽悠地　着聽着「唐明皇的軼事」。……可是這祗是屬於有錢人賞了的節日啊！</p>
<p>然而我們窮人家呢？這分外明的月夜的光是投照不進我們鴿籠也似的草棚或者是矮屋的。草棚和矮屋裏有的是：飢餓侵蝕得消瘦的面容，空着肚啼哭的孩子，床上呻吟的病人，上門討債的兇狠的眼睛，追着人家走上死路去！</p>
<p>岳子林的一家就給追上滅亡的路了。——在「中秋月」分外明的時候。</p>
<p>岳子林從前也有過十來萬的家私，因為經過陣陣的襲擊，終於保持不住這十來萬的財富而破產而淪落了。</p>
<p>然而十來萬財富固有生活習慣使他在淪落下來的現在還改變不了他的固執。他死要面子，他是不願他的第二個兒女——阿榮（卽妹妹）去給人家當使女的，但是一家六口子的食糧，都重壓在姐姐——大女兒的身上，靠做工來養活是担當不下的。</p>
<p>阿榮是一個天真無邪的小姑娘，因為先得美麗，却給主人家的少爺胡信美騙上了。可是她年輕，她的意志異常薄弱，她不知道這是一種騙欺啊！</p>
<p>正如「他玩厭了那些小姐們：現在要拿我們窮人開心了！」</p>
<p>「你年紀還輕，不會懂得的，可是你要知道他們就是眞喜歡你，過不幾時就又忘記了……」她的姐姐說得對。她的姐姐是一個新的女性，她在做着婦女大衆的解放運動在向主子們交涉着提高待遇的事。因此她們的廠正停着工。</p>
<p>可是她們一家為了生活，妹妹又被騙遺棄，她們的母親遭受了重重刺激，先毒害了三四二個妹妹，而自己也自殺了。</p>
<p>妹妹是瘋狂的跑了出去。姐姐呢？她是去領導着大衆們反抗那些殘忍的主子們！</p>
<p>父親追趕不着她們倆，失望的回來。</p>
<p>「你一個人活着幹嗎？」</p>
<p>唉！都死了。</p>
<p>總之，這樣的故事都市裏是層層的在發生着，可是，那些孩子是無辜的。太殘酷了啊！</p>
<p>救救孩子吧！</p>

<p>— 萊</p>
<p>一個性情孤僻的藝人</p>
<p>因為作風的不同，因為性情的孤僻，李思廉霍華L　　Howarvl幾乎成了被遺忘的人。不但現在的一部份觀衆對他很模糊，卽在影城好萊塢，對他的談論，述路和描寫甚至謠傳都很少。在他本身說，這樣的環境不但於他毫無妨碍，並且正適合了他的要求，而避免了許多無謂的騷擾。但在影片商人的立場上，以生意眼來看，簡直是自己走上了毀滅的路途。——因為他不像克拉克蓋博爾和家雷古柏等明星似的慣出風頭，能自動的替本身和影廠作義務的宣傳，更加以他對於不合自己個性的角色，不主張强作，如同她拋棄了和葛來泰加賓主演的「瓊宮恨史」的安東尼一角，因為他不是那麼風流，不主張戀愛其上。所以他主演片子很少，所以人們對他的印象也很模糊。在銀幕上，他給我們的性格，穩重，謙和，大方，有時也埋不住他的內心的熱情和天真。看過「國際大秘密」的人，不會忘記他和開弗蘭西絲在馬車上調情的一幕吧？那種熱情的表現，沒有一些美國式的輕浮與淫穢。在「孽債」裏又是一個年少老成被惡環境所引誘着的角色，你看，這是多麼現實的性格呢？但人們却不喜歡他，因為人們要的是刺激，要的是輕佻和胡調。</p>
<p>他是英國人，一八九三年四月二十四日生於倫敦，在學校讀書時，便極喜歡研究戲劇。出校後，先作銀行行員。大戰開始，投筆從戎。休戰後，作了職業演員；在百老匯第一次成功作，是和開絲琳康愛爾Katherine　Cornell合演的「緣帽子」The　Green　Hat。現在他一邊拍影戲，一邊還出現於舞台，尤以後者工作的時間較前者為多。（未完）</p>

They will also seek economic cooperation with neighboring provinces, barter goods, and use surpluses to make up for shortages in other provinces. Later, when talking about the future of the Guangxi situation, Huang was very optimistic, believing that the people of Guangxi are urgently seeking governance, and Li Bai should realize this. Zeng Yangfu said that he was ordered by the Central Government to serve his hometown this time and will work hard on Guangzhou's municipal administration.

He is also willing to explore public opinion, eliminate the suffering of the people, and build a new Guangzhou. (Fifth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jiujiang) By telephone from Guling, Li Bai replied to a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the 31st, which was in response to a telegram sent on the 28th. The telegram arrived in Guling on the 2nd, stating briefly: "I have received and read your telegram with respect. We fully understand the Central Government's painstaking arrangements for our new appointments. However, regarding the grand plan for resisting Japan and saving the nation, we still earnestly request clearer and more concrete instructions so that we can follow them. We will discuss and decide on the follow-up matters here after meeting with Brother Jikuan," and so on. Chairman Chiang immediately replied with another telegram, the original text of which reads: "Your telegram has been received. I have read your telegram and know that you deeply understand the Central Government's painstaking arrangements, which is very gratifying. As for your request for clearer and more concrete instructions regarding the grand plan for resisting Japan and saving the nation, the Second Plenary Session has already made a clear and concrete declaration regarding the limits of diplomatic policy and the determination of national policy. The Central Government's intentions must have been conveyed in detail by Comrade Li Chongyi upon his return to Guangxi. If you are talking about concrete plans, not only can they not be declared by telegram at a distance of thousands of miles, but from the perspective of national responsibility, the concrete plan for the highest decision can only be requested from the government by the highest central agency, and the central government should only report to the highest central agency. You are members of the party and soldiers. You only have to follow the Central Government's decisions and plans and implement them accordingly. Therefore, your second priority is still to accept all the tasks entrusted to you by the Central Government. Then, there is no need to worry about not hearing clear and concrete instructions. As for the aftermath of the Guangxi affairs, you want to wait for Jikuan to return to Guangxi for consultation before making a decision. However, the decision to clean up the Guangxi situation was not voluntary on the part of Jikuan. If you think about it from Jikuan's perspective before accepting the new appointment, he may also be inconvenienced in returning to Guangxi suddenly. Moreover, from a general perspective, the Central Government's appointments are people who have a deep relationship with Guangxi Province, and Xu Chu and Heling are already in Guangxi. If they can sincerely serve the country without any discrimination, then the military and political affairs of Guangxi Province have already been entrusted to someone, and you can break away from the current situation and quickly take up your new positions without worrying about the aftermath. If you must wait for Jikuan to arrive in Guangxi for consultation before deciding what to do, how will you silence the voices of the outside world and accuse you of holding onto the local area and being unwilling to give up? At this point, both domestic and foreign observers believe that whether you two can break away from the Guangxi situation and accept the new appointment is a true measure of whether China's unification has been genuinely completed, and whether you two are willing to give up separatism and break feudalism is the only condition for sincerely participating in saving the country. If you can give up separatism and complete unification, you will have the foundation for saving the country. We should dedicate ourselves to the revolution and aim for the long term. The ability to make decisive decisions and to let go is true courage. I hope that you will leave Guangxi immediately and come to Nanjing to accept your new appointments, and that you will meet with your comrades in the Central Government as soon as possible, or, as in the telegram from the Central East, please come to Guangdong, and I will also arrange for Brother Jikuan to come and meet with you. Regarding the aftermath of the Guangxi situation, if there are any matters to be discussed, we can discuss them together. I can also explain the details of the party and national plans to you. I hope for a reply soon." (Fifth Central Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Issue of Japan Establishing a Consulate General in Chengdu Without Authorization <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>In recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, a problem of no small importance has arisen. This problem is that Japan, without adhering to the provisions of the treaty, has established a consulate general in Chengdu without authorization, dispatching Iwai Eiichi, the leader of the China Division of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, as consul to act as consul general. Iwai returned to Japan for instructions in late June, and after returning to Shanghai at the end of last month, he took a ship to Chengdu on the 2nd of this month to take office. According to the Central News Agency's news report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country notified the Japanese Embassy to stop this action. At the same time, the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai also sent a telegram to oppose it. However, Iwai went ahead regardless and took office.</p>
<p>Why do we say that this is a problem of no small importance in recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations? Because there are many problems between China and Japan that are countless times bigger than this. Moreover, the damage caused by Japan's actions to our country's sovereignty is indeed not small. Originally, according to the principles of international law, the dispatch of consuls must be based on the provisions of treaties. In the current treaties signed between China and foreign countries, it is only allowed for treaty ports to be the location where foreign countries can dispatch consuls. Chengdu is neither a treaty port nor an open port. Japan has no reason to establish a consulate without authorization. If Japan can establish a consulate in Chengdu without authorization, then it can also use this as an example to establish consulates in any other inland areas of China in the future. Would this not be a great hindrance to China's sovereignty? Moreover, the establishment of consulates in China by imperialists is very different from the establishment of consulates between general international countries. Because the imperialists enjoy consular jurisdiction in China, the status of all consuls is the same as that of diplomats (referring to ambassadors, ministers, etc.; consuls are not diplomats), and they enjoy many extraterritorial rights. If imperialists are allowed to establish consulates in the inland areas of China without authorization, then the scope of application of consular jurisdiction will naturally expand. At a time when we are working hard to abolish consular jurisdiction, Japan's unauthorized establishment of consulates should naturally be strongly opposed.</p>
<p>Now, Iwai has gone ahead regardless and taken office. What methods should we use to stop him? First, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs should, based on the provisions of the current treaties and the principle that Chengdu is not a treaty port and is not allowed to establish a consulate, negotiate with Japan to stop it. In the past, Chengdu, because it was the capital of Sichuan Province, the consuls of various countries stationed in Chongqing had representatives permanently stationed in Chengdu for the sake of convenient liaison. However, Britain and Germany had already canceled this due to protests from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. France also canceled it not long ago. Now, Japan is taking the step of establishing a consulate general, which is of course completely without legal basis. Second, according to the principles of international law, the appointment of a consul must first obtain a certificate of recognition (Exequatur) from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the host country; otherwise, their performance of duties should be rejected. According to the Central News Agency's news report, since our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked Japan to stop the unauthorized establishment of a consulate general in Chengdu, it will certainly not agree to Iwai's appointment as consul and give him a certificate of recognition. Since Iwai has not obtained the certificate of recognition from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then we can, in accordance with international practice, not recognize Iwai's status as a consul and prevent him from exercising consular functions.</p>
<p>However, what is said above is from the perspective of international law. In the current international community, international law is the weakest. All important international treaties have been pierced into scraps of paper by the bayonets of the imperialists. To give an example right before our eyes, Japan can establish consulates in the inland areas of our country without authorization, but the Japanese military authorities can arrest and imprison Sun Bingqian and seven other consular students stationed in Qingjin Port, Korea, without following international practice. Therefore, if we want to solve this problem of no small importance, we must first start by solving the bigger problems between China and Japan. In other words, we urgently need to re-establish an entire diplomatic policy towards Japan.</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Alxa Banner is a key passage to Ningxia. Previously, three Japanese people, including Yokota, suddenly arrived in the Alxa Banner by plane for inspection. Soon, nine Japanese people, accompanied by one Han Chinese and one Mongolian each, went to the Alxa Banner from Bailing Temple by camel, notifying the Wangfu that they would form a special agent organization in the area. The banner immediately telegraphed Daliyazaya Wang, who was staying in Beiping, to return to the banner to handle the matter. There is still no progress on this matter. Recently, in the Ejin Banner of Ningxia and Pingliang and other places in Gansu, many Japanese people have also gone to plan the establishment of special agent organizations. The Ningxia and Gansu authorities are now planning countermeasures. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan to expand police power in North China has been drafted by the Consulate General in Tianjin and submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. It will be implemented soon. A police department will be established under the Tianjin Consulate General, modeled on the organization of the police department of the Consulate General in Shanghai in South China and the police department of the puppet Manchukuo Embassy. The existing consulate police station will be expanded. The current 130 police officers and officials will be doubled. Sub-bureaus and sub-stations in Jinan, Beiping, Qingdao, Gubeikou, and the Beining, Jinpu, and Pinghan railway lines will all be under its jurisdiction. Korean patrols will also be added to prevent any activities by the Independence Party. The target implementation date is early October. The purpose is to liaise with the garrison army's gendarmerie and make necessary preparations for times of emergency, seemingly trying to turn North China into a southern Manchurian railway zone. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the increase in the number of Japanese residents in China, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to expand the police department of the Consulate General in Tianjin. The number of police officers will also be doubled, and police sub-bureaus will be added along the Qingjin, Beining lines, and Gubeikou. They will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Police Department. (Fifth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Maritime Anti-Smuggling Patrol Boats are divided into four teams, based in Qingdao. Close liaison and interception will be strictly enforced. The Tianjin patrol boat will be transferred to Qingdao for inclusion in the team. The sugar price has fallen sharply, causing the ronin to lose heavily. They have been mixing in white soil, changing each bag to two bags. Customs has intercepted the goods and verified this, and has issued a notice to pay attention. On the 5th, dozens of Korean ronin, disguised as immigrants, bought tickets for rayon piece goods and other items, posing as passengers to travel south on the Pingpu train. Customs officials intercepted them and seized 200 pieces of smuggled goods. A Korean named Jin Wanshi complained to the Japanese Consulate that he had 412 yuan in paper money hidden in his suitcase and wanted it returned. The Japanese Consul Nagai has forwarded this to Customs. Because the ronin are selling rayon piece goods door-to-door in the Tianjin brocade factories, and are allowing credit purchases, more than a dozen factories have closed down or resumed business in a week. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Tonghua visited Feng Heming and Chen Juesheng, directors of the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway and the Beining Railway Bureau, respectively, on the morning of the 5th to exchange views on anti-smuggling. Chen and Feng each expressed their sincere views. The Beining is considering and will reply to the matter of the Jin East Station road police assisting in anti-smuggling. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs urgently need industrial salt for export. Because the export of reed salt is difficult to achieve in the short term, the Xingzhong Corporation, Mitsui, and Iwai have invested 2 million yuan with the Eastern Hebei government to establish the North China Salt Industry Company, providing technical assistance for the development of salt fields. They will also take the reed salt stored in the Hangu beach and transport it to Japan for sale. It is scheduled to be established in October. Currently, the Eastern Hebei government and Xingzhong and other companies are proceeding with this plan. The authorities are paying close attention to this matter because if this move is realized, the salt production in the Eastern Hebei area will become a monopoly, destroying the salt administration of North China.

<p>(Tianjin) The existing spindle counts of textile mills in North China are as follows: 1. Hengyuan: 35,000 spindles; 2. Beiyang: 25,000 spindles; 3. Yuda: 35,000 spindles; 4. Huaxin: 32,000 spindles; 5. Yuyuan: 74,000 spindles; 6. Baocheng: 27,000 spindles. Among the above six mills, Hengyuan and Beiyang are operated by the Chinese Chengfu Trust Company, while Yuda, Yuyuan, and Baocheng are operated by the Japanese. Huaxin will also be acquired by the Japanese soon. The Toyo Textile Company will build the Yufeng branch mill in Tianjin next year, with an initial capacity of 50,000 spindles. It is expected that the Yufeng branch will add another 50,000 spindles after October next year, Yuda will increase by 10,000 spindles, and the other mills will increase by 30,000 spindles. Fukushima Textile Industry, a large Japanese textile company in Shanghai, and Dai Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd. all have new mills being built in Tianjin, so the total will be at least 500,000 spindles. If Chinese-owned Beiyang and Hengyuan still exist, they will be fighting with 60,000 spindles against 440,000 spindles. Currently, the Tianjin market sells 150,000 bales of locally spun yarn and 100,000 bales of Shanghai-Qingdao yarn annually. After the Japanese mills are fully operational, the North China market will be oversupplied, and the sales markets in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins will inevitably be seized. The Chinese textile industry will go bankrupt within three years, and major changes will occur in our economic sphere. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau completed an investigation of the Huaxin Textile Mill and instructed them to draft a self-rescue plan.

The Social Affairs Bureau agreed to forward the request. Recently, the mill contacted Nichibo and Kanebo to seek a purchase agreement, and they have sent expert Kawako to Tianjin for inspection.

<p>(Nanjing) The detailed implementation rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations have been drafted by the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office. After inviting relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance to hold a meeting for review, they have been reduced to more than 40 articles and are currently being submitted to Minister of Finance Kong for review. They are expected to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation before the beginning of September. It is reported that the tax payment deadline and payment methods for income tax have been generally stipulated. For the first category, companies, businesses, shops, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, income from profits, and income from joint government-business profit-making enterprises, according to the annual settlement period of each industry, from March 1st to the end of May each year, or from August 1st to the end of September, the person in charge of the business shall pay the tax in a lump sum. For temporary profit-making business income, if there is a paying income organization at the time of settlement declaration, the person in charge of the organization shall withhold and pay the tax on their behalf; otherwise, the taxpayer or their agent shall pay the tax themselves. For the second category, salary and remuneration income, the head of the organization or property owner directly paying the salary and remuneration shall withhold and pay the tax on their behalf on a monthly basis. If there is no paying income organization or employer, the taxpayer shall also pay the tax themselves. For the third category, income from securities deposits, the person in charge of the interest-paying organization shall withhold and pay the tax on their behalf at the time of interest settlement declaration. As for the calculation of the amount of the first category of profit-making business income, the original calculation is very complicated. It is neither possible to make a general provision nor convenient to make a precise provision. In the detailed implementation rules, after referring to the laws and regulations of various countries and the items stipulated in our country's accounting law, appropriate provisions have been made. However, it should either be stipulated in separate regulations or be based on the customs of various places and industries, with the taxpayer submitting their own declaration and the government making a reasonable assessment. Minister of Finance Kong still needs to make a decision. (5th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) International disputes and European peace are becoming more complex due to the Spanish Civil War. European countries are attacking each other, and the relations between the great powers are gradually becoming tense. The recent developments are summarized below, which can give a glimpse of the dangerous situation:</p>
<p>(1) The Paris Echo newspaper reported that the German battleship "Deutschland" and the destroyer "Luchs" apparently hindered Spanish government warships from bombarding rebel forts in Ceuta, Morocco. (2) The Times reported that Milan residents had informed Italian expatriates that 36 painters from the Breda aircraft factory in Italy had worked day and night on July 26 and 27, painting over the markings on 12 bombers. These aircraft later flew to southern Spain and Morocco to assist the rebels. In addition, 18 more bombers had also flown to the Spanish war zone. (3) The Associated Press correspondent in Tetuan, Morocco, reported that the rebels had ordered 20 aircraft from Italian and German factories. (4) The Associated Press correspondent in Madrid reported that the bombs used by the Spanish government forces to bomb the Guadarrama mountain pass were apparently manufactured abroad. (5) Leading French figures declared that the Spanish rebels had conscripted Moroccan natives to fight against the government forces, which had apparently violated the Moroccan agreement signed between France and Spain.

<h3 id="e53">British Government Reply: London and Paris Press Satisfied <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(London) All morning newspapers welcomed the British government's reply to the French government, supporting the non-interference in the Spanish Civil War. The Times stated that the government's correctness was undoubted. The adoption of a non-interference policy by all countries was essential. The principles of the fighting by both sides in Spain are deeply held by the majority and minority parties in various countries. What other countries should always carefully avoid is allowing the flames to spread. Europe is now full of flammable materials, and a spark is enough to start a prairie fire. The civil war in Spain could easily turn into a civil war in Europe. (5th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government submitted a reply to France yesterday, accepting in principle the proposal that countries should conclude an agreement not to interfere in the Spanish Civil War. Press reviews expressed satisfaction, but they feared that Italy's reply would not be so satisfactory. Renowned journalist Beltina published an article in the Paris Echo, stating, "Germany and Italy, in view of the Third International's interference in Spanish domestic affairs, will do their utmost to demand an explanation from the Soviet Union." Foreign affairs journalist Madame Taboui of the Times stated, "During yesterday's meeting between Foreign Minister Dalbos and Italian Ambassador Cerutti, Cerutti raised</p>

<p>(Paris) Britain and Belgium have both responded with agreement to France's ultimatum requesting a joint declaration of non-interference in the Spanish civil war. However, Germany's acceptance is conditional on the Soviet Union also accepting, and Britain's is conditional on Italy's agreement. France is currently anxiously awaiting Rome's reply. Official circles in Rome have remained silent about the nature of Italy's reply, but diplomatic and political circles there feel that France's ultimatum is likely to exacerbate an already difficult situation, so they do not welcome it. At the same time, in order to expedite a resolution to this issue, France has instructed its representatives in Moscow and Lisbon to make the same proposals to the Soviet and Portuguese governments. Britain's reply states that a declaration of neutrality by Britain, France, and Italy on the Spanish issue is only a preliminary step for diplomatic negotiations among the countries concerned, especially the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the note proposed by France, which requests that the countries concerned form an agreement to pledge not to interfere in the Spanish situation, the British government submitted a reply to the French embassy this afternoon. According to official sources, the reply accepts the French proposal in principle, but with a reservation: that existing British law must be respected. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the British government solemnly stated in the reply that it fully agrees in principle with France's proposal to ban the export of arms to Spain, but argues that Germany and Portugal should also join the embargo, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve effective results. The British government also requested that France notify Britain as soon as it receives Italy's reply, so that the governments of Britain, France, and Italy can draft a joint declaration as soon as the countries concerned, especially Germany and Portugal, are willing to join the agreement, declaring a ban on the shipment of arms to Spain. Political figures stated that the British reply only mentioned the embargo on weapons and ammunition, and that ordinary commercial transactions should not be prohibited. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Informed sources here have a very good impression of the British reply and say that Britain and France agree that the issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war should be resolved quickly within the realm of possibility. The British government now advocates that the scope of the "non-interference" agreement should be further expanded to include Germany and Portugal, but also agrees that Britain, France, and Italy should issue a joint declaration as soon as Italy submits a satisfactory response.

<p>Fort-de-l'Eau, French Algeria. Regarding the matter of two Italian aircraft flying to Spanish Morocco and being forced to land in French territory, the French authorities have now completed their investigation. It has been proven that these aircraft belonged to the regular Italian Air Force before July 20th. The machine guns on board were loaded with live ammunition and various wartime equipment. The fuselages had just been painted to cover up the Italian Air Force markings. Some of the pilots were Italian officers disguised as commercial and recreational pilots, as evidenced by their military passports. It is now known that the aircraft departed in great haste, without proper preparation to conceal the aircraft's nationality and the pilots' identities. According to the pilots, all the aircraft assembled in Borgo, Italy, and flew to the Elmas airfield in Sardinia on July 29th, and flew out at 5 a.m. the next morning, heading for Melilla in Spanish Morocco. One aircraft crashed into the sea en route, and all the crew members were eaten by fish. Also, after the aircraft were forced to land, a Spanish aircraft flew over the landing site and dropped a package containing several sets of uniforms of the national foreign legion and a letter written in Italian, stating, "Put on the uniforms quickly and tell the French that you are members of the Spanish Foreign Legion. Wait a moment, and we will bring you two barrels of gasoline and a mechanic to help you fly out. Be cautious in all your actions and do not fall into the clutches of the enemy." It is clear that the Italian aircraft were going to join the Spanish rebels. The local court will try the Italian pilots for unauthorized flight over French territory, and the aircraft will be temporarily impounded by the French military authorities before sentencing.

<p>(Berlin) A spokesman for the Army Ministry today vehemently denied that the arrival of the German battleship "Deutschland" and the destroyer "Luchs" at the port of Ceuta in Morocco was an act of interference in the Spanish civil war, saying that the two ships arrived at Ceuta only to protect German nationals.

<p>(Paris) The right-wing newspaper "Le Jour" yesterday published a report claiming that the government, under the pretext of transporting overseas nationals to safety, sent aircraft to Spain to indirectly assist the Spanish government. Official sources have denied this claim and explained the facts as follows. It is said that the French diplomatic representative in Spain had previously requested the French government to send three aircraft to Spain for dispatch in order to transport French overseas nationals to safety. At that time, the Spanish government provided assurances to France that it would not requisition the aircraft. The French government then dispatched three commercial aircraft, without carrying weapons, to Spain, intending to fly regularly between Madrid and Alicante, transporting overseas nationals to Alicante and then shipping them to Oran in French North Africa. This plan began on July 29th. However, the authorities in Alicante requisitioned one aircraft on the same day, and the other two aircraft were requisitioned together the next day. The French consul there protested repeatedly to the Spanish authorities for three days from the 29th to the 31st. By the 2nd of this month, the Spanish government had returned all the aircraft to France. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>The three conditions are as follows: (1) Negotiations must not be held by Britain, France, and Italy alone; (2) Germany and Russia should also be invited to participate; (3) The French government must not exploit the Spanish civil war to exaggerate its rhetoric as a pretext for inciting a crusade against fascism.

<h3 id="e60">Fierce Fighting Throughout Spain: Government Forces Send Large Reinforcements to the Sierra de Guadarrama; Rebels Use German and Italian Aircraft to Cover Preparations for Crossing the Sea <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Madrid. Fierce fighting is taking place throughout Spain, and major developments are expected. It is anticipated here that a decisive battle may occur in the Guadarrama region north of Madrid in the next two days, as government forces have sent large reinforcements in an attempt to encircle the rebels, whose destination is Madrid. At the same time, rebel leader General Mola, while meeting with reporters in Burgos, the seat of the provisional government, said that although the navy had refused to join the revolution and the Basque Nationalist Party was fickle, all military operations were still proceeding according to the original plan. Mola also said that the revolutionary forces had transported a large part of their troops stationed in Morocco across the sea to Spain, and that these troops were now gradually advancing towards their destination, Madrid. He added that his troops in the north would certainly be able to make contact with General Franco's forces in the south. According to the rebels, after fierce fighting with the militias formed by local workers, they have occupied Ronda, located fifty miles northwest of Algeciras in southern Spain, with heavy casualties on both sides. It is also reported that Teruel, seventy miles northwest of Valencia, has also been occupied by the rebels. Judging from the current situation in Spain, it can be seen that the government controls Barcelona, the Mediterranean coast, and the inland provinces up to Malaga in the north, Madrid and its surrounding provinces, the Atlantic coast from San Sebastián to Oviedo, and a portion of the western border from Huelva northwards. The rebels now occupy Zaragoza and a large portion of the inland provinces, including the cities of Burgos, Valladolid, and Segovia. The southern end of Spain around Gibraltar, including Algeciras, the northwestern part of Spain around Corunna, and a portion of the territory along the Portuguese border. All Spanish colonies are in the hands of the rebels, with the government only having a foothold in the Balearic Islands. Therefore, judging from the above situation, the government now controls the industrial areas and the coastal areas, while the rebels occupy the agricultural provinces, but their access to the sea has been cut off except for the south and northwest. The rebels are now planning to unite their troops with the help of troops coming from Morocco. This morning, an aerial battle took place in the Strait, witnessed by a large number of people. It is said that as a result of the air battle, the government's air force gained a slight victory, with two rebel aircraft forced to descend and another two fleeing towards Ceuta in Spanish Morocco. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Ceuta, Spanish Morocco, North Africa. According to our correspondent, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebels, is now planning to send a large contingent of soldiers across the Strait of Gibraltar to return to the country and help in the war. If they are intercepted by warships belonging to the government forces, they will fight them. Currently, three postal ships are fully loaded with soldiers and weapons, ready to depart. At that time, six Italian aircraft, three German aircraft, and six other aircraft will escort them across the sea. These aircraft are ready for take-off at the air force base in Tetouan. The German cruiser "Deutschland" and the destroyer "Luchs" sailed to Cadiz in southern Spain yesterday. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, all war reports have been complex and confusing, and difficult to ascertain. Observers here have recently summarized the latest situation in both countries based on the most reliable information, namely that the rebel's attempt to occupy the capital Madrid and the government army's plan to recapture Zaragoza have both failed to materialize so far. The areas controlled by the government army and the rebel army are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the government army side, in addition to the capital Madrid and its surrounding areas, it still controls the following areas:</p>
<p>(a) The Extremadura region bordering Portugal in the southwest, including the provinces of Cáceres and Badajoz. (b) Most of the New Castile region in the center, including the provinces of Toledo and Cuenca. (c) The Murcia region along the Mediterranean coast in the southeast, including the provinces of Murcia and Albacete. (d) The province of Valencia. (e) A part of the province of Aragon. (f) The autonomous region of Catalonia, including the four provinces of Barcelona, Lleida, Tarragona, and Girona.</p>
<p>(2) The rebel army controls the following areas: (a) The entire Spanish Morocco in North Africa. (b) Most of the Andalusia region in the south, including the provinces of Seville, Córdoba, and Granada, although the province of Málaga is still in the hands of the government army. (c) An area in the southern part of the New Castile region. (d) The provinces of Galicia and León in the northwest, extending to the provinces of Valladolid and Segovia (northwest of the Sierra de Guadarrama). (e) The Old Castile region in the north, including the province of Burgos, where the "National Defense Junta" is located. (f) The province of Navarre in the north, from which the rebels plan to break out of Irún and San Sebastián to find access to the sea. (g) The province of Aragon, where the base of Zaragoza is located. (h) Three naval bases, namely (i) the port of Huelva, in the southwest, close to the Portuguese border, (ii) the port of Cadiz, along the Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the British port of Gibraltar, (iii) the port of Algeciras, near the port of Gibraltar. With the above situation now clear, it is possible to proceed to describe the general trend of the current war. Although the rebels hold three naval bases, all other ports on the Mediterranean coast are in the hands of the government army, and the navy is still loyal to the government. The rebels have had to change their original plan of operations, and are eager to find ways to enable the troops of General Mola, commander of the northern route, to make contact with the troops of General Trianu, commander of the southern route, so as to attack simultaneously from the north, southwest, and north, trapping the New Castile region in the center. As of now, the troops of General Mola, commander of the northern route, are waiting for the southern army to move north in large numbers to meet in the Central Plains, and are preparing everything. As soon as they occupy a good position, they will fight a decisive battle with the second government army. In recent days, fierce battles have taken place in the vicinity of the Somosierra Pass in the near north, the reason for which is precisely this. According to observers, the date for both sides to make a desperate gamble and decide the outcome is not far off, because both sides lack bullets, which is conducive to a quick battle.

<p>Madrid. The government has recently issued a war report as follows: (1) The General Staff has received a report from Colonel Sabia of the Northern Front, stating that his troops captured the village of San Rafael (north of the Guadarrama Mountains) last night, but did not occupy the village that night for fear of being attacked in the dark. (2) A column commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Mangada defeated a rebel team near Villacastín (on the way to Ávila) on the Northern Front yesterday. (3) Government forces in the province of Guadalajara (northeast of the province of Madrid) pursued the rebels and have crossed the city of Sigüenza in the northern part of the province. (4) Government forces have recently intercepted intelligence from rebel forces in various places, revealing that the rebel forces in Córdoba, Zaragoza, and Burgos are in dire straits due to a lack of ammunition. (5) The air force belonging to the province of Catalonia shot down an enemy aircraft east of Zaragoza. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Burgos, Spain. A special dispatch from our correspondent, the "National Defense Junta" organized by the rebels, recently issued a war bulletin stating that the revolutionary forces on all fronts have made progress:</p>
<p>(1) In the Guadarrama Mountains on the Northern Front, although the aircraft belonging to the government forces are very active, the revolutionary army has made progress in its positions.</p>
<p>(2) The troops of General Franco, the leader of the revolutionary army on the Southern Front, have advanced towards the city of Madrid and occupied several positions, the names of which cannot be announced.</p>
<p>(3) In the villages of Azaila and Tardienta on the Eastern Front, southeast of Zaragoza, the revolutionary army of Zaragoza clashed with government forces, killing and wounding many and capturing many government vehicles.</p>
<p>(4) In the city of Cáceres on the Western Front (on the Portuguese border), after the revolutionary army clashed with government forces, the cities of Miajadas and Trujillo have been relieved. A total of ninety government troops were killed in this battle. In addition, the "National Defense Junta" strongly condemned the Madrid government's aircraft for dropping bombs on the port of Palma (on the island of Majorca in the Mediterranean) and the Cathedral of Our Lady in the cities of Huesca and Zaragoza, which have no defensive fortifications, as inhuman. It also stated that the aircraft bombing these places were not commonly used by the Spanish army, and that the bombs that fell on the ground were also different from the styles used in Spain, indicating that they were all from foreign countries.

<p>Barcelona. The Cathedral of Our Lady in Zaragoza, which is currently stationed by a large contingent of rebel troops, is an important strategic location. It was bombed by aircraft belonging to the autonomous province of Catalonia, and it is reported that the rebels suffered extremely heavy losses. The government of the autonomous province has recently opened two new air bases in the provinces of Tarragona and Huesca to facilitate air force operations. The village of Azaila southeast of Zaragoza was captured by the rebels, but was immediately repelled by government forces by land and air, and the rebels suffered heavy losses, abandoning four field guns. In addition, according to news from the front line of the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital, the government forces there have also made progress, having occupied the villages of San Rafael and Villardendre, north of the mountain pass. As for the front line in the province of Guipúzcoa in northwestern Spain, the rebels did not launch a counterattack as the government forces had expected. It is reported that the rebels are experiencing a severe shortage of supplies, especially a break in the source of gasoline, which has made them unable to move. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>Madrid. The Ministry of Interior recently issued a broadcast message stating that General Franco, the leader of the rebels in Morocco, recently telegraphed Mola, the leader of the rebels in the north, from Tetouan, saying that Lulz, the leader of the People's Action Party (i.e., the Catholic Party), had raised foreign currency equivalent to 2 million pesos in the Portuguese capital for the use of the rebels. This telegram was intercepted by the Ministry and will be announced to the people, so that they know that "the person who is funding this heinous rebellious act is Lulz, who had sworn allegiance to the republican government (Lulz served as Minister of the Army in the Radical Party's Lerroux Cabinet). Now he is risking disapproval and supporting the rebels. If there is no resolute action by the people to suppress him, the entire country will be overthrown by the insurgents." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>Madrid. The official confirmation of the government forces' recapture of the village of San Rafael north of the capital yesterday. The village is located northeast of the Guadarrama Mountains and is a popular tourist destination. It has been occupied by the rebels on the Northern Front since they started their revolt, because its terrain is dangerous and the roads from the capital north to the provinces of Segovia and Valladolid pass through the village, making it an important strategic hub. According to our correspondent, the column that captured the village was commanded by Colonel Sabia, bypassing the city of El Escorial west of the capital, circling down from the highest peak of the Guadarrama Mountains, surprising and attacking the rebels in the village of San Rafael, capturing it in one fell swoop, and entering the village that night, seizing a large number of firearms, ammunition, and cash. Our correspondent also went to the front line of the Somosierra Mountains in the north for inspection and sent a message saying that the rebels on that front fired a 155-millimeter cannon and threw incendiary bombs yesterday to cover two cavalry squadrons charging the government forces' positions. However, because the terrain there was not conducive to cavalry, and the government forces' defenses were solid, they immediately used machine guns to strafe the rebels when they saw the cavalry charging, annihilating all the rebels. At this point, the rebels no longer had the ability to launch an offensive. In addition, the rebel headquarters in the city of Burgos (i.e., the seat of the revolutionary army's "National Defense Junta") yesterday used wireless radio to direct the northern troops to recapture the village of Guadarrama with all their strength. Unexpectedly, this telegram was intercepted by the Ministry of the Army, which immediately notified General Li Gaiermei, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Front, to respond accordingly. The General decided to take preemptive action and sent two battalions of militias, namely the "Steel Army" Battalion and the "May 2nd" Battalion, to launch an offensive against the enemy's position, and ordered the artillery and air force to assist in the battle. A fierce battle will ensue. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Minister of the Army Terauchi Strenuously Advocates Increasing Funding to Strengthen National Defense; Cabinets with a "Weak Knee" Should Not Remain in Office; Parliament Opposes the Reform Program; He Will Not Hesitate to Dissolve Parliament <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 2nd: Army Minister Count Terauchi declared that reform is what the nation needs today. Any cabinet member who cannot implement reform should resign immediately without hesitation. Politics is not my business, but I dare say that a cabinet member with a "weak knee" has no reason to remain in office. National reform naturally requires enormous funding. However, you do not need to raise taxes to raise it. Increasing taxes to raise 200 or 300 million yen is far from enough to meet the needs of our reform program. The urgent need now is to issue sufficient public bonds to cope with the current situation. The army's defense budget requires 300 million yen, but you should not be shocked by this. I will even go a step further and ask for 500 million yen. You should know that today's expenditures are not comparable to those of 30 years ago. In the past, defense expenditures were only calculated in tens of millions of yen, but now they must be calculated in hundreds of millions of yen. The country must strive to raise funds for national defense. If the expansion of national power is sought, the budget will continue to increase. If Parliament opposes the reform program, I will dissolve it, not just once, but again and again. We only seek to implement reform, regardless of the procedure.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Navy Minister Nagano Osami stated that there are currently 25 warships under construction, totaling 72,000 tons, and 8 planned but not yet started, totaling 20,000 tons. When all 183 ships totaling 780,000 tons are completed, there will clearly be a sense of being beyond the reach of the strength of Britain and the United States. Especially in this era without treaties, Japan should strive to catch up and strengthen national defense in order to dominate the Western Pacific. Therefore, the main focus of the new national defense plan currently being actively discussed is to concentrate on the large-scale construction of various warships below capital ships and air fleets, requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve huge expenditures to avoid regrets. This plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval around the 10th of this month along with the next fiscal year's budget. The content is centered on countering the superiority of the British and American navies in order to realize its ambition to dominate the Pacific. (Fifth Hualian dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens: An order for martial law throughout the country was issued here this morning, and the dissolution of the Greek Parliament and the establishment of a temporary dictatorial government by General Metaxas were announced. In his order, Metaxas stated that he ordered the dissolution of Parliament because it was unable to effectively sanction the systematic opposition to the government and the dangers of communist propaganda. If allowed to continue, it would lead to social and national misfortunes. This action by Metaxas follows the declaration of a general strike throughout Greece. The authorities are deeply concerned about the threat of a serious communist movement and have threatened to use force to end the strike, and have obtained the approval of King George of Greece to adopt this approach if necessary. (Fifth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: After King George II ordered the dissolution of the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Metaxas effectively became the dictator of Greece. He issued a proclamation to the people this morning, saying, "The situation is critical and cannot be dealt with without centralized power. I have been entrusted by the King with a heavy responsibility and will not hesitate to make every effort to save the country. I hereby inform the people of the country." Metaxas then explained the danger of communism and said that the distribution of seats in the current House of Representatives among the various parties was insufficient to produce a lasting government. This is why the King approved the two measures of promulgating martial law and dissolving the House of Representatives. "If any reactionary elements dare to undermine the Greek national revival movement, they will be severely punished without leniency." (Fifth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to Greek expatriates here, the main reason for the country's decision to establish a dictatorial government and dissolve Parliament is clearly because the communists in the House of Representatives have the power to hold the balance of power. Because the last election adopted a proportional representation system, the result was that the power of the Venizelos faction and the opposition party members in Parliament was almost equal. The Communist Party, because it won 15 seats, has a pivotal influence on the vote. The Greek expatriates here also said that because members of Parliament enjoy privileges, the Communist Party dares to cause disturbances without fear of being arrested. (Fifth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The politician who supports Ugaki will have new plans. The newly appointed Korean Governor-General Minami Jiro called on Hirota at 2:00 p.m. today to receive his official title. It is decided that tomorrow, he and the new Director-General for Political Affairs, Ohno Midoriichiro, will go to the Hayama villa to meet the Japanese Emperor and thank him for his trust. According to Minami's words to reporters, Korea is the old place where he was the commander of the army, so he is very clear about everything. Moreover, the nobles and high officials there are all acquaintances, which is very convenient for future work. However, I (Minami refers to himself) am not familiar with politics.

<p>(Tokyo) On the 5th, the Japanese Emperor issued an edict awarding General Ugaki Kazushige and Baron Yamamoto Tatsuo the Paulownia Grand Cordon. (Fifth Allied dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After General Ugaki Kazushige, who resigned as Governor-General of Korea, sorts out the remaining affairs, he is scheduled to return to Tokyo from Seoul in the middle of this month. Given the general's impression and relationship in the political arena, now that he has stepped down, the politicians surrounding the general will inevitably begin to promote the grand unity of the Seiyu Party and the Kokumin Domei, with the general as the leader, aiming for the next regime. Although the move to merge the political parties has been attempted by politicians many times, there are many reasons for the circumstances within the party and the relationship of the local base. Even though it is an era of decline of political parties, it has not been possible to abandon past habits and realize the merger of the two parties. At the same time, according to the current objective situation, even if a super-powerful party can be formed, there is still no hope for the revival of party politics. Therefore, General Ugaki, seeing this trend, will inevitably change his views on the political situation. No matter what the surroundings are doing, the plan must adopt the principle of standing upright and not being involved in the vortex. Based on this policy, what kind of role General Ugaki's posture of waiting will play in the future political situation can only be understood after its transition. However, regardless of the general's state of mind, after his resignation, he will inevitably cause various plans and waves in the political world with his comrades as the center. There is no doubt about it. (Fifth Allied dispatch)</p>

<p>Madrid: Foreign Minister Basia, in a statement to the press this morning, said that the reporters of several foreign newspapers have been spreading false news about the situation in Spain in Andaye, France, which is scoffed at by people with insight and does not need to be corrected by the Spanish government. However, there is something that the government cannot but draw the attention of world opinion to, namely, that since the rebellion of the rebels, the government has provided promises to the countries concerned that it will protect the lives and property of foreign nationals. This is because the diplomatic corps recognizes that the Spanish government has fulfilled its responsibilities. As for the traitors, since they have engaged in illegal activities, they will inevitably fabricate lies to cover up their mistakes. However, the government's suppression of the rebels is progressing day by day, and its authority is increasing day by day. It will soon see the rebellion quickly quelled, and the world will be able to understand that the Spanish government's words and deeds are consistent. (Fifth Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The editorial in Pravda stated that "The Soviet working masses are paying close attention to the Spanish people's war against the fascist rebellion. The Soviet people have expressed their attitude towards the war by holding thousands of sympathy rallies, marches, and raising funds to help the Spanish democratic commonwealth soldiers." "The military rebellion in Spain is an international conspiracy against the Spanish nation. The German and Italian fascists are directly involved in this conspiracy, striving to create a war focus in Europe and North Africa. Therefore, the Spanish workers and peasants are fighting for a democratic republic and a free and unified Spain, and at the same time they are fighting for peace. Millions of Soviet workers have loudly protested against the fascist interventionists. The voice of the Soviet people will resound throughout the world." Radic, in the Izvestia, said, "Observe the fear and deception of all classes around the world towards any revolution. The German and Italian fascists are preparing to intervene in the Spanish revolution. This is to give them the most important excuse to prepare for a world war and re-divide the world. Although they know that the Soviet Union is thousands of miles away from Spain, and they cannot find a Soviet political worker in Spain, they still shout about Soviet intervention. They are doing this in order to cover up with this cry and prepare for their own intervention, in order to achieve the most important goal of their foreign policy."</p>
<p>Radic continued, "The Soviet working people have expressed their great sympathy for the Spanish masses in mass rallies and grand marches, because the purpose of the Spanish masses' struggle is to resist the fascist bandits' policy of using bloodshed to destroy the buds of Spanish freedom. Resisting Spanish fascism is also to strive for peace and resist the German and Italian fascists' attempt to use the rebellion to consolidate their world position.

Today, all honest people in the world should unite under the following slogans: "Down with the fascist rebellion! Oppose intervention in the Spanish Republic!" (Fourth TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Banks here have received notification that an order will be issued tonight or tomorrow morning to cancel the method of using registered marks to pay for German exports. This step by the German side is clearly to retaliate against the United States' method of levying countervailing duties on German goods. Up to now, registered marks could be used to pay for certain types of goods, such as toys and pottery. It is said that half of the trade between Germany and the United States is paid in "aski" marks, 25% is paid in goods, and the remaining amount is paid in registered marks or part cash. After the issuance of this new order, the above-mentioned method will inevitably be completely overturned.

<p>The National Government issued an order on the 5th, now promulgating the Regulations on the Transfer of Judicial Police. This is the order.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Former Acting Minister to Russia, Zhu Shaoyang, Subject of a Kidnapping Plot; Kidnappers Include Two Japanese and One Chinese; Mrs. Zhu Abducted; Police Intercept and Luckily Solve Case Immediately <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Zhu Shaoyang, former minister to Finland and acting minister to Russia, has lived quietly in Beiping since retiring from his post, residing at No. 115 on the main street inside Chaoyangmen. He avoids politics, spending his time with poetry, books, and charitable endeavors. He currently serves as the vice president of the Mount Wutai Universal Relief Buddhist Association, going to the office every day. On the morning of the 4th, at around 8:00 AM, two Japanese and one Chinese, all wearing blue cloth gowns, arrived at the Zhu residence with cards, requesting to see him. Zhu's private car, number 四七三, was already parked in front of the gate, waiting to be used. They handed the cards to the chauffeur, which were imprinted with phrases such as "Entrusted by the Kwantung Army Headquarters," "Entrusted by the Military and Political Department of Manchukuo," and the name "Tada et al.," requesting to see General Zhu. The servant said this was Minister Zhu's residence, but they insisted on visiting Minister Zhu. They were led into the parlor and told that the minister was ill and could not receive guests, but the three repeatedly insisted. Zhu eventually came out, despite his illness, and after exchanging pleasantries, the three immediately said that two people, named Zhang and Li, whom the minister had criticized while in Finland, had now committed a crime. Therefore, the Gendarmerie Headquarters had sent them to ask the minister to come back and clarify the matter. Zhu said that was absolutely not the case. After repeated negotiations, nothing was resolved. Mrs. Zhu, Wang Jiawei, overheard the conversation indoors and reported it to the First District by telephone. The district immediately dispatched police officers to the Zhu residence. However, the three men brandished guns, drove the police into a room, and insisted on taking Zhu away. Mrs. Zhu volunteered to go in her husband's place, saying he was ill. The three then took her to the Zhu residence's private car, number 四七三, and drove west. After the three left, Zhu reported the incident to the municipal government by telephone. Mayor Qin Dechun ordered Counselor Zhu Ruilin to investigate together with Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Jigan and notified the Japanese police station to inquire about the situation. The Japanese side said they were unaware of the matter and dispatched personnel to investigate with our detectives. They learned that the car had left Xizhimen and was heading towards Changping County. They immediately notified the Changping County government to intercept the car. However, the car crashed into a ditch in Xisha Village, eight li from Changping, causing the car to overturn. The driver, Cao Defu, broke his leg, but the three men were unharmed. They took Mrs. Zhu and left. Cao went to Changping to report the case. It was already 2:30 PM. Soon, the county police arrived and captured two of the three men in a teahouse in Baifu Village near Xisha Village. After inspection, they were found not to be carrying guns. They were interrogated about the whereabouts of the others. They confessed that the others had taken Mrs. Zhu and villagers to Dongchu to take a car. The police immediately escorted the two men to Xisha Village, where they saw the other man holding a handgun and holding Mrs. Zhu. The man opened fire upon seeing the police, but luckily missed. He was captured by the police, and two handguns were found. Mrs. Zhu, Cao Defu, and others were escorted to the county. On the 5th, they will be transferred to Beiping. Beiping received the report of the solved case and learned that the men were staying at rooms 28 and 允 on Xiannmen Street, Xian Inn. Two were Japanese, named Kato Asaji and Ooyuu Eiichi. The Chinese man was named Ren Xiaoxia, also known as Yan Bowen, 26 years old, from Jilin. He had an 18-year-old mistress, Wang Shaoti, living with him. That evening at 7:00 PM, detectives went to Xian Inn to arrest them, but both rooms were empty. Inquiries at the inn revealed that all three men had a habit of taking white powder. They had left the inn at 10:00 PM on the 3rd and had not returned. Wang Shaoti had also left the inn on the morning of the 4th after receiving a phone call. While discussing the situation, another person came to the inn to inquire about the case, raising suspicion. He was arrested by the detectives. He confessed his name was Han Zixing, and he was taking white powder in a Korean opium den at No. 16 Houchang Alley. He was entrusted by Wang Shaoti to come and inquire about everything. Wang Shaoti was still taking white powder in the den. Detectives and police from the Fourth District went to Houchang Alley and captured Wang Shaoti. The cause of the incident has not been fully determined, but it is generally believed that the drug dealers failed to defraud money and resorted to kidnapping. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Banditry in Southwest Fujian Rampant; Investigation into Major Robberies in Recent Weeks; Pacification Headquarters Orders Divisions to Take Responsibility for Suppression <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The bandits in Southern Fujian and the Communist bandits in Western Fujian took advantage of the unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi to stir up trouble. Later, the largest bandit group, led by Zhang Kewu, was incorporated into the 11th Security Regiment and stationed in Datian. The six counties of Yongde, Dehua, Daquan, Putian, Xianyou, and Xintai in Southern Fujian gradually became peaceful. However, there was still a gang led by Lu Zhenshan entrenched in the second, third, and fourth districts of Anxi. The Security Office specially dispatched Adjutant Lin Qian to negotiate with them for incorporation. The negotiations have not been completed. Currently, banditry is still rampant in Anxi and Nan'an.</p>
<p>In Western Fujian, there are Communist bandits led by Zhang Dingcheng, and in Zhangpu and Nanjing in the Zhangzhou area, there are Communist bandits led by Zhang Changshui, all causing great harm. The following is a record of the most notable bandit activities in Nanquan and Zhangzhou and Western Fujian in recent weeks: (1) On the 21st, the bandit Guo Zong led over a hundred men to attack Pengxu, 30 li from Anxi city, burning several earth fortresses and looting over 100,000 yuan. Over thirty villagers, men and women, were killed. They retreated on the morning of the 22nd. (2) On the 23rd, Zhang Changshui led over a hundred bandits to intercept two passenger cars on the Longzhao Road at Makou Bridge in Zhangpu County. Fortunately, both cars sped through, but a soldier of the security escort team was killed and two passengers were injured. Later, they looted a cargo truck and burned it. The incident lasted for several hours. The large unit of the 75th Division rushed to the scene after hearing the news, and the bandits fled. (3) At 11:00 PM on the night of the 23rd, dozens of bandits attempted to attack the city outside the West Gate of Zhangping, but they were repelled by gunfire from the garrison. On the 25th, people from all walks of life in Zhangping telegraphed the Pacification Headquarters, saying, "Bandits are entrenched in the Wuliang and Erliang Mountains, burning, looting, and killing everywhere. They are dividing up the rice fields in the northwest second district and are now approaching the county seat several li away, posing an imminent danger. Please send troops to suppress them." It is reported that there are over a thousand bandits in the Wuliang Mountains. (4) On the 27th, a cargo truck on the Zhanglong Road carrying 3,000 jin of salt was attacked by bandits west of Shizhong. The driver was killed, and the salt was looted. This was the work of Zhang Dingcheng's gang. (5) On the 26th, a passenger car on the Longzhao Road from Zhangzhou to Zhangpu was attacked again by Zhang Changshui at Makou Bridge. Four soldiers from the 75th Division retaliated, and the bandits fled. (6) On the 27th, the town of Qilipu in Yunxiao was attacked by over five hundred bandits, who burned dozens of houses and looted everything. (7) On the 27th, the bandit Wu Wupengming led over a hundred men to attack Tanbian Village in Xiaoluoxi, Nan'an, looting over 20,000 yuan and kidnapping nine men and women, demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan. (8) On the 28th, Wu Wupengming again attacked Putou Village in Xiaoluoxi, burning four houses, kidnapping ten people, and causing losses of several thousand yuan. (9) On the 29th, Zhang Changshui led over a hundred bandits to attack the villages of Yang, Piliao, and Qujiang in Nanjing County. The strong men's team came out to fight, but they were outnumbered. On the 30th, the villages of Zhangliao and Ban were also attacked. The bandits then attacked Fengqiaoping. The strong men retreated to Changjiao. At 9:00 PM on the night of the 30th, they continued to attack Kuikeng. Villagers in various villages who could barely support themselves were labeled as rich peasants. Currently, traffic from Shancheng to Chuanfan, Kuiyang, and Changjiao in Pinghe County is completely cut off. The organization "Military and Political Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic of Southwest Fujian, Yonghe, and Jing" was discovered in the Changjiao, Youkeng, and Fengshuping areas of the third district of Nanjing. The fake chairman is Li Tianhui, and the fake vice-chairmen are Zeng Shouning and Luo Yongjian. (10) On August 1st, a passenger car on the Longzhao Road from Zhangpu to Zhangzhou was intercepted by dozens of Communist bandits at Gehoutaobiao, ten li from Liaopu County. The ticket seller, Deng Zishi, was killed and his body was abandoned by the roadside. The driver and all the passengers were kidnapped and disappeared.</p>
<p>The above only records attacks on towns and villages and interceptions of highways and cars. There are countless other sporadic bandit robberies. The Pacification Headquarters, due to the rampant banditry in Western Fujian and the Zhangzhou area, has specially ordered the 9th Division, 52nd Division, 3rd Division, and Independent 37th Brigade to take responsibility for suppressing the remaining bandits in Western Fujian. The 75th Division is responsible for suppressing the remaining bandits in the Zhangzhou area. The 75th Division's Han Brigade and various security regiments are responsible for suppression and appeasement in Anjing and Nan'an in the Quanzhou area. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Major Construction Projects in Gansu Province; Focusing on Highways and Water Conservancy; Afforestation, Animal Husbandry, Cotton Planting, etc. Progressing Accordingly <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Gansu Province has a vast territory, fertile fields, abundant resources, and thriving livestock. However, the population is sparse, development is delayed, and society is overly conservative, purely subject to natural environmental control. This has resulted in infinite resources being left to waste, which is a great pity. The provincial authorities are also facing financial difficulties and cannot do everything at once. They can only select key projects within the possible scope and try to develop them. First, highways and water conservancy are taken as the central work, and ways are sought to develop them. Afforestation, animal husbandry, cotton planting, cooperation, and other matters are also progressing easily. The general situation of the main construction work in recent years is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Farmland Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Gansu Province has a high and dry terrain with little rainfall. Even in good years, the harvest is not enough to eat. In the event of drought, it is even more difficult for the people to make a living. According to surveys, the annual rainfall (referring to rain and snow) in the southern part of Gansu is 20 inches, and in the eastern part, it is 15 inches. The average annual rainfall in the province is at most 1.2 Chinese feet. In 1935 it was 1.1 Chinese feet. The actual water demand is at least 3 feet to be sufficient. It can be seen that even if Gansu is not droughty, the amount of water is still not enough. Although Xinjiang does not have much annual rainfall, we have not heard of drought, because the Altai and Tianshan mountain ranges, which are over 5,000 meters high, can store rain and snow. However, the mountains in Gansu Province are no more than 3,000 meters high, so they cannot store rain and snow. Currently, the total area of wasteland and cultivated land in the province is over 23 million mu, while there are only over 2.7 million mu of paddy fields. If the total population of the province, over 6 million, is divided equally, each person can only get half a mu. Each mu usually produces 400 jin of food per year, which is only enough to maintain the food supply for half a year for the entire province. The remedy is to increase the area of paddy fields by 3 million mu. However, Gansu is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and the amount of water is relatively small. There are only 27 canals that can be opened along the Yellow River. When all are completed, a total of over 900,000 mu of land can be irrigated. In addition, wells must be dug on the plateau, or canals must be added to other rivers to increase the area of paddy fields by over 2 million mu, so that the people's food supply can be solved in drought years. The Taohui Canal project is currently being actively carried out by the Construction Department. The Tonghui, Shuifeng, and Xingu canals have also been surveyed one after another and are being designed. The Construction Department also borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Economic Commission, which will be used to excavate in rotation in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Jailbreak in Putian; Thirty-Five Prisoners Escape on July 24th; Third Major Jailbreak in Just Nine Months <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: A major jailbreak occurred at the Putian District Court Prison on July 24th. Thirty-five prisoners escaped. It has been investigated that there have been six or seven major jailbreaks in Putian Prison from last year to now. The largest was a major riot by prisoners on October 17th last year, when 61 people escaped. 19 were captured, and 42 escaped. The second major jailbreak was on June 17th this year, when 59 major criminals escaped. This is the third time. At 10:00 AM on the morning of July 24th, two prisoners from cell number three and two from cell number five were released to clean up the garbage in the yard, supervised by guard Chen. Unexpectedly, a prisoner from cell number five took advantage of Chen's inattention and struck him on the head with a stone. Chen immediately fainted. The four prisoners then opened the iron locks of other cells. Prisoners from several cells then surged out. Other guards came out to see what was happening and were immediately supervised, forced to open the locks of all the remaining cells, and released all the prisoners. They swarmed to the second prison gate, which had iron bars. The prisoners worked together to violently crash into the iron bars. The iron bars were not installed securely during construction and were knocked down. At that time, warden Deng Jimin was upstairs and fired two shots at the escaping prisoners in front of the door. The bullets hit the wall. The fifth trigger jammed, and the prisoners rushed to the main gate of the prison, broke the lock, and ran away in all directions. It was raining heavily at the time. Some of the prisoners had jailbreaking experience. Instead of escaping towards Tangbei Dingwei, they went in the opposite direction, calmly escaping into the crowded streets in front of the Tangxian Yamen. The county government heard the news and sent military police to pursue them. In the past, prisoners who escaped always fled towards Tangbei Dingwei, so the pursuit went in that direction. As a result, nothing was found. Of the 35 prisoners who escaped, including Yu Meihua, ten had been sentenced, two were military prisoners, and 23 had not been sentenced. (August 2nd)</p>
<p>Highway Transportation</p>
<p>The total length of the highways in Gansu Province is 7,000 kilometers. The main lines connecting to the outside are the Ganxin, Ganshan, Ganning, Ganqing, and Ganchuan highways. (There are two routes to Sichuan Province. The first route starts from Lanzhou, follows the Xilan Road to Huajialing, turns to Tianshui Cheng County Wudu, and connects to Guangyuan in northern Sichuan. The second route is from Lintan to Minxian, 50 kilometers long.) The construction cost is over 30 million yuan. The provincial authorities believe that the provincial treasury can hardly afford such a large amount, so for the construction of various highway projects, in addition to the old method of repairing bridges and culverts, earthwork engineering is completely done by requisitioning labor, so that the cost is low and the effect is great. The Ganshan Lanyao section, the Ganchuan Lantai section, and a part of the Tianma Road branch have been opened to traffic. The Lantao and Zhaoqin roads are partially completed. The Lanxiang section of the Ganqing Road is currently being actively rushed to repair. The Economic Commission's survey team led by Liu Rusong has surveyed the Ganxin Road to the first major section to Wuwei. It is currently organizing charts and will start construction as soon as it is completed.</p>
<p>Afforestation in Progress</p>
<p>Gansu Province has paid close attention to afforestation in recent years and has designated it as one of the most important construction policies. According to statistics, the number of trees planted each year was over 290,000 in 1933, over 400,000 in 1934, and over 1.5 million in 1935. The provincial government believes that mountain floods often occur in the summer and autumn seasons, causing disasters. If there are dense forests, the flood damage can be slightly reduced. Therefore, in order to expand the afforestation plan, it invited Fen Jueer, the deputy director of the Shaanxi Forestry Bureau, to Gansu for surveying last year. The Ministry of Industry also decided to jointly establish a forestry area in seven provinces, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Qinghai. A forestry bureau will be established as the competent authority for forestry affairs in each province and will carry out afforestation matters in stages. Afforestation along the Yellow River is also in progress. In addition, cooperation and animal husbandry are also being promoted separately according to the planned plans. However, Gansu's imports exceeded exports by over 23 million yuan last year. In the past, all income from opium was used to offset this, but now smoking is being gradually banned. The only remedy is to encourage cotton planting. It started last year, but there has been no significant effect. This year, 5 million jin of cotton seeds have been received and distributed to Gao and Yu counties for trial planting. If the expected results can be achieved in the future through cooperation between the government and the people, the trade deficit can be balanced.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Suzhou; Establishment of Running Water Underway <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>In previous years, local residents Xu Boming and overseas Chinese Liang and others initiated the establishment of running water to meet local needs. However, due to various reasons, it did not materialize. Recently, Shanghai merchants Wang Xiaolai, Shao Ruxin, and others initiated the establishment of running water together with local gentry Zhang Yipeng, Cheng Ganqing, and others. Several contacts have been made, and there are already some clues to the implementation plan. Yesterday, Shao Ruxin came to Suzhou from Shanghai to discuss the implementation with Cheng Ganqing and others. Shao then returned to Shanghai to discuss with Wang and others in order to realize it as soon as possible. It is reported that a preparatory office will be established in both Suzhou and Shanghai to facilitate contact. The share capital is assumed to be one million. The initiators in Shanghai will be responsible for 250,000, and the initiators in Suzhou will be responsible for 250,000. The Electric Power Plant has already recognized 50,000. There are 200,000 that will be raised by opening shares to the public. The water source may be taken from Lake Tai near Xukou, or from Cheng Lake in Yangcheng Lake, but it has not yet been determined. Once the contact is completed, the founders will be convened in Suzhou to hold an inaugural meeting and engage in preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Smoked Meat Industry Strives for Tax Exemption <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Suzhou smoked meat industry previously requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to strive for exemption from business tax, on the grounds that the industry had already paid slaughter tax. The request was disapproved. The Business Tax Bureau then sent personnel to collect business tax from various stores, resulting in misunderstandings. The shop assistant Chen Amao and others were arrested, but then released on bail. Now that the bureau must collect taxes in accordance with the regulations, the industry convened an extraordinary general meeting of member representatives from various stores on the 5th to discuss whether to pay business tax. As a result, based on the principle of one tax per item, they requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward the reasons to the Tax Bureau and the Department of Finance and strive for it in a reasoned manner to reduce the burden.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Wu Yannong's Estate in Litigation <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Wu Yannong of Taohuawu in northern Suzhou was the richest man in Suzhou, with a huge fortune. Wu Yannong passed away ten years ago, leaving behind an estate of five to six million. Apart from a part that was divided among his children, most of the land was still managed by Wu Zishen of the second branch together with Wu Jiyu, a clan uncle. Now, Wu Silan of the sixth branch claims that his brother and others have not disclosed the management of the property for more than ten years and that there is a suspicion of embezzlement and fraud. He has specially hired lawyer Hu Shikang to write a complaint requesting the court to summon Wu Zishen and others to publicly announce the accounts for analysis. The District Court held a hearing on the morning of the 5th. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Hu, and the defendant Wu Zishen also hired lawyer Jin Henian as his agent. Wu Jiyu hired lawyer Cai Taokang as his agent. After questioning by Judge Chen, it was decided to hold eight hearings.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Wuxi; Dispatch of District Instructors <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The autumn sericulture season has already begun. The County's Sericulture Model Area Office held a departure guidance meeting at 8:00 AM yesterday in the area's auditorium. The meeting was attended by Director Long, the county magistrate, Deputy Director Zhou Yuanxun, and over a hundred district instructors. Chairman Zhou Yuanxun gave a speech, followed by a speech by County Magistrate Long and a speech by Cai Jingde. After the meeting, a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The instructors in the four townships and various districts departed uniformly on the 5th to establish guidance centers in various townships and prepare for all autumn sericulture guidance matters. However, due to budget cuts, ten fewer guidance centers will be set up in this autumn season compared to last year. There will be a total of 65 guidance centers in the county. A total of 90 instructors will be hired. There will also be two sericulture training classes with over 30 students. There have been some adjustments to the directors and instructors of the central guidance centers this term.</p>

<p>The Jiangping steamboat of the Shanghai Gongmao Steamship Bureau was returning to Shanghai from Wuxi at 2:00 AM on July 31st. When passing the Dengjiajiao turn near Huangdu, it violently crashed into a rice boat belonging to Liu Ada of Wuxi. Boat hand A Bao was knocked into the river and drowned. A Da pursued the steamboat to Huangdu and reported it to the town's guard post, which detained the steamboat. Township Chief Zhang of Xihuang Township reported to the county government, which appointed Zheng Cheng, the head of the Nan Yi Public Security Branch, to lead officials to investigate. A Da and the steamboat crew were brought to the county for questioning. After questioning, it was clear that there was no way for Liu's boat to avoid the collision. The steamboat was still running at full speed at the turn. There was also no effort to rescue the victim after the accident. It was ruled that the Jiangping steamboat should compensate the deceased's family with 300 yuan to settle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Changshu; Thorough Investigation into Fish Tax Embezzlement <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The fish tax collected at the Hupu fish market here during each fishing season is used to run local businesses. Recently, it was discovered that the fish tax collected by Yusheng Fish Bank in the area has not been remitted since 1927. Someone filed a complaint with the province. The Provincial Department of Finance, because the amount of the donation has been very large for ten years, sent a special investigator to Changshu, accompanied by the chief of the second section of the county government, to investigate. As a result, the historical account books of Yusheng, Futai, Yuda, Jutai, Longmao, and other five firms were brought to the county government for review to determine if there were any tax issues. However, because the various firms could not collect the historical account books in time, they were given seven days to send them to the county.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Zhenjiang; Damage to Jiaoshan Relics Case <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The north of Jiaoshan has many rocks and strange shapes. Jiaodi Rock is one of the famous rocks in northern Jiaoshan. In the spring, the abbot of Dinghui Temple in Jiaoshan, Monk Jingyan, said that Xiaojiaoshan in northern Jiaoshan, which is dozens of square feet in circumference, could be used to build several houses to attract tourists. However, it is isolated in the river, dozens of feet away from the mountain. In winter, when the water is low, it is possible to walk back and forth. In summer, when the water is high, traffic is cut off. Jingyan decided to build a stone embankment to connect them. He had nowhere to take stone materials, thinking that there were many large stones on the northern slope of the mountain, so he bombed Jiaodi Rock to obtain the village. He did not know that it was Jiaodi Rock recorded in the mountain chronicle. Although there were people who warned him at the time, he did not pay attention. Then Xu Shanqing, a painter from Haiyun Temple who had lived on the mountain for a long time, came forward to sue Jingyan for intentionally destroying the relics at the court, county government, and county party headquarters. Before receiving the court's notice, Jingyan hired someone to salvage a larger stone that had been blown into the river. Fortunately, the three characters Jiaodi Rock were still on the stone. In fact, the old Jiaodi Rock was about two fathoms high and divided into two like horns. More than 20 people could sit on it, but the stone salvaged from the water was only as tall as a person, with no hills or valleys to speak of. Jingyan used this as evidence and asked the county government to issue a statement prohibiting anyone from suing him again. The plaintiff said that the size of the mountain stones was different before and after, and that the mountain was bombed for more than one day, which was known to everyone. The reasons for both parties were insisted upon, so they became deadlocked. Yao Qisu, a member of the county party headquarters, was sent to the mountain to investigate the truth of the case. He questioned both parties one by one and investigated the situation of the bombed stones. It has now been discovered and will be submitted to the county party headquarters meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Danyang; Thousands of Acres of Farmland Flooded <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The County has been raining for days. Mountain floods broke out. Thousands of acres of farmland in Houhu Township in the western countryside have been submerged. Yesterday morning, more than two hundred farmers, men and women, from the township braved the rain and entered the city to petition the county government and the first district office. Zhu Liquan, the township head, also submitted a petition requesting that relief be provided. In addition to telegraphing the county government, District Chief Zhang also sent a letter to Liu Yeqiu, director of the Lianhu Engineering Office, asking him to come to the office for consultation. As a result, Director Liu telegraphed the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office to ask for instructions and was allowed to open the first and fourth gate of Lianhu West to discharge water. The engineering office then sent a letter to the first district office to check and handle it. District Chief Zhang then sent a letter to the Lianhu Property Management Office to open the gate to discharge water to save farmland. The farmers were satisfied and returned to their hometown.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yangzhou; County Government Urges Payment of Land Tax <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The county government believes that after the wheat harvest, new grains will soon be available, and the rural economy has seen a recovery. In addition to actively urging the payment of land tax and signing and submitting more than a thousand large households in various districts, ordering them to complete the payment immediately, it also ordered Sha Ziyang, director of tooth tax, to personally go to various townships to check the tooth licenses, limiting the time for renewing new licenses to increase tax revenue.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Jiaxing; Seedling Field Road Robbery Case <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Hongquan, a bill collector from Yuansheng Rice Shop in Jia Yu Tanghui Town, collected 800 yuan in accounts from Chang'an, Xiashi and other places on the 4th, and took the night train back to Jiaxing. When he arrived at the station, it was already 8:00 PM. After getting off the train, he went to Mao Xinheng Transportation Company to rest, and then hired a rickshaw to return home. When passing the seedling field, two bandits suddenly appeared, holding wooden sticks, blocking the car from moving forward, and dragging Zhu out of the car, hitting him on the head with a wooden stick, causing Zhu to be injured and fall to the ground, losing consciousness. Two more bandits came and robbed all the 800 yuan in paper money and 17 yuan in hard currency from Zhu's body. After Zhu woke up, he tried to telegraph the Public Security Bureau. All the police officers were dispatched to search for the bandits in the area where the incident occurred, but the bandits had already gone far away. There have been no arrests until dawn. The reason for the robbery was that Zhu was checked by the police when he got off the car, and the paper money was exposed. The injured Zhu Hongquan went to Dexin Hospital for treatment that night.</p>

<p>According to a secret report received by Shi Zutao, the supervising inspector of anti-smuggling stationed in Pingwang Town, Yao County, a large batch of smuggled salt was passing through the area. He immediately notified the 23rd squad of the local tax police and dispatched them to intercept and capture it. As expected, they seized ten large boats of smuggled salt, weighing over 50,000 catties, in a small river ditch near Ditang. At the time, the smugglers, relying on their numbers, dared to open fire and resist. The tax police surrounded them on three sides and launched a fierce counterattack. The smugglers were no match and fled. Except for one smuggler who was shot and wounded on the spot, the rest were taken back to the team for interrogation and transferred to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Xingya followed the Premier and served the Party and the country, making outstanding contributions. In February of this year, he suddenly suffered a stroke at his residence in Shanghai. He was examined by two doctors, Jia Dingna and Laiman, and gradually recovered. On the 5th of last month, he followed the doctor's advice and took his family to No. 225 Poyang Road, Guling, for convalescence, and sent a caregiver along. As for bureau affairs, Secretary Li Suixian acted on his behalf. On the 3rd, the old illness relapsed and worsened. He telegraphed doctors Jia Dingna and Laiman in Shanghai to fly to Lushan for consultation, but the condition had already entered a coma, making it impossible to provide treatment. He passed away at 9:30 PM on the 4th.</p>

The pillar has collapsed, and I am extremely saddened. I respectfully send my condolences and hope you will restrain your grief. Wu Kaixian respectfully, printed seal."</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Eulogy</p>
<p>"On this sixth day of August in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and all working comrades respectfully offer incense and flowers to the spirit of Mr. Wu Xingya, Standing Committee Member, and say: Alas, Mr. Wu, a hero of our Party, born of the spirit and beauty of the Jing Mountains and the E River, a brilliant figure, a pioneer for the people, embracing the doctrine, following the Three Principles of the People, dedicating himself to the Party and the country, joining the army with his pen, assisting the revolution, and achieving success. When he opened the government in Anhui, he left behind a legacy of care. When he moved to Shanghai, he benefited farmers and workers. Leading comrades, he remained loyal. All looked up to him, and the masses admired him. The central government relied on him, and his virtue was rising. But heaven did not bless him, and he suffered an untimely death. The two evil spirits raged, attacking his body. He went far to Guling to recuperate in the Lushan mountains. Medicine was ineffective, and he traveled long to the realm of immortals. The news came like a thunderbolt in the clear sky. Citizens shed tears of snow, and comrades beat their chests. Alas, how vast is the blue sky, how dreamlike is this dream. Your crane carriage has flown far away, but your voice and appearance are still here. A bunch of incense and flowers, a cup full of clear wine, we offer a sorrowful tribute by your coffin, choked with endless regret. May your spirit come and accept this sincere sorrow. Alas, may you enjoy this!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was 46 years old, from Huangmei County, Hubei Province, and resided at No. 60 Shanzhong Road, Shanghai. He had one wife, two sons, one seven years old and the other three years old, and three daughters. His eldest daughter is married to Sun Yuanliang, the current commander of the 88th Division of the Central Army, as his wife. The second daughter is nine years old, and the youngest is eight years old. When Mr. Wu went to Lushan earlier, they all accompanied him. In his early years, Mr. Wu deeply lamented the corruption of the Manchu Qing government and joined the revolutionary party as a member. He served by the Premier's side during the uprising at Bai'etan. After the Premier passed away in Beijing, Mr. Wu followed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. During the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic of China, he served as the confidential secretary of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, the secretary of the Special Party Department of the General Headquarters, the director of the Political Department of the 37th Army, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Anhui Provincial Government, the acting chairman, and the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hubei Provincial Government. He is currently a member of the 5th Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, and the director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Wu participated in the revolutionary work for more than 20 years and was highly valued by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Now, he suddenly passed away due to a stroke, and all of Mr. Wu's friends are mourning his loss.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Labor Movement Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Labor Movement Students Association sent a telegram of condolence to Mr. Wu's family because Mr. Wu had served as the director of the Labor Movement Personnel Training Institute and was a sponsor of the association, with whom they had a particularly close relationship. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Mrs. Wu, Upon reading the newspaper, we were shocked to learn that Mr. Wu passed away suddenly due to a stroke. The bad news has arrived, and we are deeply saddened. Mr. Wu was a distinguished elder of the Party and the country, a model for the youth, who worked tirelessly for the revolution and made outstanding contributions. At this time of national crisis, when Mr. Wu should have been taking on difficult tasks, heaven did not bless us and took away our virtuous man. In addition to shock and grief, we are deeply saddened. We hope you will restrain your grief and take care of yourself to carry on Mr. Wu's wishes. Respectfully, the Shanghai Labor Movement Students Association."</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Assembly Representative Election Office received Order No. 8 of the Minguo General Division from the Nanjing National Assembly Election General Office yesterday, which reads: "In order to comply with the order, it has recently been found that people in various places believe that the power to interpret the National Assembly Representative Election Law and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law belongs to this office. They are submitting requests for interpretation to this office. After review, some have already been clearly stipulated, and some are factual issues. If we answer each case, it will not only easily cause disagreements but also be time-consuming. In the future, if people or groups in each election district have any matters for which they request interpretation of election laws and regulations, they should submit them to the election authority in charge for review. If it is deemed to be a question of interpretation, it should be forwarded to this office immediately. Otherwise, it should be approved and issued directly to save procedures. It is hereby ordered that the office comply with this order and forward it to the people in the area under its jurisdiction for their information."

<p>The Changde steamer of the Leping Steamship Company disappeared outside Shantou port for many days. There were more than 600 passengers and more than 70 crew members on board. All parties concerned were very anxious about this. Yesterday morning, a wireless message was suddenly received from the Taishun Wheel stating that the Changde had arrived at Huangpu, Guangzhou, at 7:30 PM on August 4. It turned out that the ship was advancing off Dengshan Island, Shantou, on August 1 when it encountered a hurricane coming from Xiamen. The radio equipment installed on the ship was destroyed. It sailed to a nearby strait to take shelter from the wind, which is why the Leping Company repeatedly called for it by radio, but there was no reply. Yesterday morning, the Ministry of Communications also used a long-distance telephone to notify the Shanghai Steamship Industry Association, requesting the association to help investigate the whereabouts. At 11:00 AM, it was learned that the ship had safely arrived in Guangzhou, and Chairman Shen of the association replied to Acting Minister Yu to reassure him. The Leping Company also notified all relevant parties of the safe news at 12:00 PM to reassure people.</p>
<p>The Zhaoshangju Haiyan Wheel, which came to Shanghai from Wenzhou, also encountered a hurricane on the way. Fortunately, it was warned in advance and sailed to Weatpeo to anchor for as long as 24 hours, until the hurricane blew to Hangzhou Bay before daring to open Shanghai, but it was already one day and night late to Shanghai.</p>

The buyers are the actual sales customers on both sides of the north and south, and the sellers are the flour manufacturers in Shanghai and inland areas. There are no outside giants shorting or speculating. The request to abolish the price limit should be approved. Please inform." After receiving the notice, the exchange immediately announced it to the public. Yesterday, the notice was received after the market closed in the morning. There was no effect because there was no filming during the summer vacation in the afternoon. It will be implemented from today. It is not expected to have any impact.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Northeast Woolen Fabric Transit Tax Should Be Changed to Import Tax; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits Request to Ministry of Finance <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "For the matter of submitting a request, on the 4th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Industry Association, the issue of inspection and anti-smuggling has been actively carried out by the inspection and anti-smuggling committee organized by your association. The association has been complying with the measures to prevent and eliminate smuggled goods. However, it has been found that the transit goods of Shanhaiguan woolen fabric, also known as ABC, which are not smuggled goods, are more serious than smuggling. After paying the ex-factory tax in the three eastern provinces, they can be transferred to the mainland with a joint transport bill. According to its tax rate, only 7.5% is paid for every 100 yuan of value, compared with the import tax of 45% for every 100 yuan, the difference is as much as 37.5%. Therefore, all products not produced by the factory can be transferred from Shanhaiguan under the name, and the tax rate can be reduced by the ex-factory tax, and they are treated the same as regular goods, and can be transported unhindered. The cost of goods is reduced, and the selling price is cheaper. The goods are tax-paid, and there is no way to prevent them. They affect the national regular tax and disrupt the commercial market. Its disadvantages are even more serious than smuggling. Furthermore, it has been found that the original ABC only refers to two kinds of woolen fabrics, but now there are many colors. Woolen fabrics have everything. The number of products is increasing day by day. If this continues, all manufactured products can be transferred at will, endlessly. The harm is immeasurable. The association is now afraid and trembling. However, this matter is important. It is not possible to correct the root cause without a comprehensive plan and countermeasures. For this reason, we are writing to request your association to forward it to the government for fundamental design and clarification of measures to maintain tax revenue and stabilize commerce, etc. The association checked the woolen fabrics. If they are made in the three eastern provinces and transported into Guan for sale through Shanhaiguan, in principle, they should be regarded as transit goods and only transit tax should be levied. However, under special circumstances in the three provinces, it is not possible for us to audit whether they are actually manufactured locally or whether there is any concealment. If we adhere to the text and meaning, it is enough for large-scale dumping. Therefore, after the closure of the customs of the three eastern provinces, during the relocation of taxation, the goods from the three eastern provinces, in addition to the few kinds designated by your department, which are definitely produced in the three eastern provinces and have no similar products, are still recognized as transit goods and transit tax is levied. All others are levied import tax according to the import tax regulations. This matter is consistent with the regulations and has a precedent to follow. Therefore, it is reasonable to report to your department for verification. Your department should carefully review the above-mentioned precedents and strictly restrict them, so that the national tax revenue and industrial and commercial livelihood can be preserved.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Selling Artificial Silk Fabrics: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Certification by Guilds <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a truthful report: On the 3rd of this month, the Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association wrote to us, stating that, in order to assist the government in preventing smuggling and to protect the sale of legitimate goods, and in accordance with the 'Provisional Regulations for Investigating the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods' promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, as well as the 'General Rules for Investigating Smuggling by Various Industries' of the Inspection and Anti-Smuggling Committee of your association, the Silk Fabric Inspection and Anti-Smuggling Committee was established. After several discussions by the association's Executive Committee, fifteen inspection rules, a voluntary registration form, an application form, and other relevant documents were formulated. A resolution was passed at the extraordinary meeting of member representatives on July 31 to set August 2nd to 11th as the registration period for existing stock. Currently, the association is supervising its various groups to implement the regulations in accordance with the inspection rules. In accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the 'Provisional Regulations for Investigating the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods' of the Ministry of Finance, when imported goods are transported to different locations, they can be accompanied by a delayed sales certificate issued by the Customs and a distribution form issued by the trade association. However, Articles 4 and 6 of the 'Measures for Investigating and Clearing Domestically Produced Piece Goods Made of Artificial Silk' stipulate that domestically produced piece goods made of artificial silk must obtain a transportation and sales permit from the Customs. This means that imported artificial silk can be transported and sold without hindrance by simply obtaining a distribution form from the trade association, while domestically produced piece goods made of artificial silk must obtain a transportation and sales permit from the Customs for each batch. This is a reversal of priorities and an inconsistency in difficulty. We respectfully present the situation of our industry and our humble opinions as follows: (1) Silk fabrics are mostly sold by traders through multiple channels, not directly by manufacturers to various locations. Silk fabric traders cannot provide artificial silk tax receipts and can only present invoices from the selling merchants and certificates from the inspection and anti-smuggling organizations in the production areas. (2) Silk fabric sales always start from a single bolt. Requiring a transportation and sales permit from the Customs for each bolt would cause inconvenience to both officials and merchants. (3) The fifteen inspection rules established by the association include registering existing stock and materials, stamping each item to trace the origin, and registering new stock and materials, requiring verification of tax payment certificates and supporting documents. Furthermore, a re-inspection is required before transportation and sale, and certificates are issued upon verification, which is comprehensive and prevents any loopholes. The procedures are already extremely cumbersome. If we were to follow the above-mentioned 'Measures for Investigating and Clearing Domestically Produced Piece Goods Made of Artificial Silk,' then the hundreds of silk stores in the city would be transporting and selling thousands of bolts of silk fabrics daily, and requiring a permit from the Customs for each bolt would be time-consuming and uneconomical. Furthermore, the store staff would not be sufficient to handle the workload, and the running around and congestion would be unbearable. Therefore, we request your association to forward this matter to the Ministry of Finance, so that the transportation and sale of imported artificial silk and imported artificial silk fabrics should be handled in accordance with the 'Provisional Regulations for Investigating the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods' promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. As for domestically produced piece goods made of artificial silk and blended silk, we request that the association's inspection rules be followed. After the association verifies and issues certificates, transportation and sale should be permitted in order to maintain legitimate commerce and reduce unnecessary procedures." Upon consideration, silk fabrics produced by silk weaving factories are mostly sold through traders, not directly. Therefore, it is possible for silk weaving factories to obtain tax payment evidence from artificial silk import merchants in exchange for a transportation and sales permit. However, it is practically impossible for silk fabric traders to require silk weaving factories to provide evidence of artificial silk import tax payment for each batch before purchasing. Furthermore, there is no legal basis for obtaining transportation and sales permits from the Customs based solely on the invoices issued by silk weaving factories. It is difficult to approve this request, as it is the most challenging issue currently faced by traders. The key to whether tax-evading artificial silk is used as raw material lies with the weaving factories. Now that nine articles have been established to strictly regulate and restrict these weaving factories, domestically produced silk fabrics should not contain any mixed use of tax-evading raw materials. Therefore, a simpler and easier method can be devised for auditing traders. Furthermore, Articles 4 and 6 of the aforementioned inspection and clearing measures specifically refer to factories and do not include traders. Therefore, the association's request for the association to issue certificates for the sale of domestically produced artificial silk fabrics does not seem to contradict the original regulations. We have enclosed the certificate form, voluntary registration form, and inspection rules formulated by the association and respectfully submit this report to your department for review and approval. Implementation would be a matter of public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tonghua Steamer Bravely Sails to Wodou: Place Name Not Listed on Charts or Maps; Loaded Salt and Returned to Fujian, Daring Not to Go Again <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Shaopu, also known as Wodou, opposite Shantou port, is a place of extremely abundant sea salt production. However, because the islands are dense and the reefs are numerous, there has never been a navigable route. The place name is not listed on any sea charts or maps. Now the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer has decided to sail there, taking a great risk and sailing on a non-scheduled route. The events it experienced are quite interesting and worthy of reporting.</p>
<p>Old Man as Pilot</p>
<p>Shaopu is located inside Wodou, surrounded by islands and reefs. The local people usually make a living by drying sea salt. Men and women are unusually brave and armed, each equipped with small boats, appearing and disappearing on the nearby sea surface, regarding the looting of merchant ships as a business. Civilian boats in the Shantou and Fujian area warn each other not to sail there. This time, the Tonghua steamer sailed there to load 100,000 dan of sea salt to Fujian. However, because the place is not listed on any sea charts, navigation was extremely dangerous. Special efforts were made to hire a pilot familiar with the harbor there, who was over seventy years old. He was first asked to sail from Shaopu in a small boat to the sea surface and then transfer to the steamer to guide the Tonghua to Wodou and drop anchor. When the pilot arrived on the Tonghua, he said to the crew members: "Wodou and Shaopu have not seen an ocean-going ship for many years. I am fortunate to be able to board an ocean-going ship as a pilot."</p>
<p>Bandits Attempt to Loot</p>
<p>The salt farmers in that area are actually bandits. They have always made a living by plundering civilian boats. Now, seeing the Tonghua steamer arrive at Wodou, they attempted to rob it. However, the Tonghua steamer also knew that the place was a den of bandits. The salt affairs inspection office had sent a squad of water police in advance, carrying firearms, to protect the ship. After the Tonghua arrived, the island bandits immediately divided into twelve small boats, each boat with more than ten people, holding sharp weapons. They arrived late at night, surrounded the Tonghua, and tried to climb aboard to rob it. The first time, the water police opened fire, and the bandits could not get close to the ship and fled. The second time, they came with even greater force and fought with the water police for a long time. Although the bandits were repelled, the water police squad leader was frightened and became ill.</p>
<p>Safe Return to Fujian</p>
<p>The sea salt produced in that area is very black in color and extremely unattractive. The value is extremely low. One national currency yuan can buy 2,000 jin or 3,000 jin. This is because things are cheap when there is a lot of them. After the Tonghua steamer risked going to load 100,000 dan, the price of salt in that area immediately increased to one yuan to buy only 800 jin. After the Tonghua steamer transported the salt to Fujian, it no longer dared to risk sailing there.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Ningbo Association in Shanghai Cables: Urgently Seeking a Solution to the Daishan Tragedy; Need to Improve Harsh and Hasty Practices; Poor Implementation by Lower-Level Organizations <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai yesterday sent a cable to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Bureau, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner's Office regarding the Daishan tragedy, stating: "Regarding this unfortunate incident in Daishan, our association has received reports from our fellow villagers in Daishan, informing us that the greed and recklessness of the tax police stationed in Daishan were the main reasons for inciting the incident. Fortunately, the Yinxian District Administrative Commissioner rushed to quell the situation, appease the refugees, and assign the responsibility for arresting the murderers to the local officials, preventing the tax police from taking the opportunity to retaliate and extort money. The handling was essential, and the situation in the area has been temporarily stabilized. However, after the pain subsides and we reflect on this unprecedented tragedy, we must urgently seek a solution. We believe that the crux of the matter is that the recent handling of fisheries and salt affairs by the salt affairs organizations has been too harsh and hasty, and there is a need for improvement. Based on what our colleagues know, there are several points that we will briefly describe as follows:</p>
<p>Fishing Surveillance Changes</p>
<p>While still in the research stage, Rongcheng County in Shandong Province has been approved to temporarily exempt fisheries and salt from implementation in order to prevent disputes. However, Daishan has not yet been approved. Tax police arbitrarily demand things, and if things are not done according to their standards, they are punished. Fishery salt confiscated due to discoloration is resold by the tax police without waiting for it to be dyed. The salt farmers witness this and become increasingly resentful. Furthermore, discolored salt, regardless of whether it is red or black, cannot be welcomed by customers for pickling fish. Using rice bran will cause it to rot due to heating. It is recommended that the current method be immediately stopped and that it be implemented after the experiment is improved or after adopting regulations from neighboring countries in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Selling Fish Surveillance</p>
<p>There has never been a time limit because offshore fishing tides are extremely important. Occasionally missing the right time will result in wasted effort. In the old system, regardless of the time, even late at night, salt could be purchased and the anchor could be raised. Now, time is limited from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. No flexibility is allowed after the time limit, resulting in fishermen having orders but no salt, missing the fishing season, and suffering unexpected losses. It is recommended that orders be issued to restore the old regulations in order to show compassion. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Fishing Surveillance Order</p>
<p>Previously, it was only once a year, then changed to once a season. Now, an order must be obtained for each trip to sea, which increases the tax by five to six times compared to the initial annual order. Furthermore, any salt left over from the previous order must be confiscated. Fishermen do not catch much fish, resulting in salt being left over. The old regulations allowed them to temporarily store it and take it back on the next trip to sea, which was a fairer approach. It is recommended that the issuance of orders be relaxed appropriately and that strict orders be given not to confiscate leftover salt in order to slightly reduce the burden on fishermen. This is the third point. Handling old piles of salt has already caused inconvenience to salt farmers, and the failure to provide timely compensation for the use of civilian land has led to widespread resentment and rumors. It is said that salt farmers make a living by drying salt, and in good years, they are only self-sufficient. They are deeply afraid that transporting salt back will waste working time and that the reduction in production will affect their lives in the future. This is their actual situation of fear. Those whose salt fields have been enclosed and cannot continue to work have even greater resentment. It is recommended that efforts be made to avoid the suffering of salt farmers and that compensation be paid on time for the enclosed salt fields so that unemployed salt farmers can find alternative livelihoods. This is the fourth point. In short,</p>
<p>Government Affairs Should Maintain the Big Picture</p>
<p>It is not appropriate to be overly demanding in everything. What is being done now has the opposite effect. The Daishan incident has already happened. In addition, tax police in Shenjiamen are known for deducting salt from farmers' labor (farmers transport saline mud to pay for labor, which is called labor salt), and tax police in Ningbo are known for dumping the old salt from fish shops (wooden buckets used to hold pickled fish have leftover salt, and salt police order them to be dumped and not reused, resulting in repeated conflicts). All the demands are extremely trivial, resulting in insufficient revenue and excessive harassment of the people. This may not be entirely the intention of the salt affairs authorities, but rather due to poor implementation by lower-level organizations. In the old system, tax police who suppressed smuggling were controlled by nearby bureaus, and the bureaus had the right to correct any excessive harassment of the people. Now, the tax police stationed in a part of the area are allowed to exercise their powers freely. If the leader is incompetent or if they are eager to claim credit, the harm that they can cause is unimaginable. This is another issue that should be discussed in the current system. Lao Tzu said, "The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" The people have never not feared death, but when forced to die, they do not fear it. When they do not fear death, there is nothing they cannot do. The outbreak of the Daishan case is frightening. Now that there are many border troubles, these people who are accustomed to wind and waves and are physically strong, and the public should be especially taken care of by the government. Our association has a connection to our hometown, and we have seen what has happened. We dare not fail to report it in detail. We hope that you will pay attention to it and await your orders.</p>

<p>The Industrial Society reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Chinese Pavilion at the US Texas State Centennial Exposition has been completed and requesting funding to allow domestic goods manufacturers to prepare exhibits and participate in the competition in order to promote national glory and facilitate progress. According to the Ministry's notice Shang Zi No. 44812, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded a telegram from Vice Consul Zai Qinglun in Houston on June 5 stating that the Chinese Pavilion at the US Texas State Centennial Exposition has been completed as scheduled, costing US$50,000, and that there will be cultural and educational exhibitions and films from the Central Propaganda Department, etc. Previously, the Chicago Exposition had a goods exhibition association, and Zhou Guanhong, a member studying in the US, signed an agreement with the authorities of the US Texas State Centennial Exposition to participate in the conference by building a Chinese pavilion at his own expense and was willing to provide 2,000 square feet for domestic manufacturers to display their products. He sent a letter asking manufacturers to participate, and the Ministry forwarded it to the association to discuss and proceed with the national goods manufacturers. The association replied that it had informed the various industries and would select products to participate, and the Ministry also consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forwarded it for the record. According to the telegram, in addition to replying to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hereby notify you that after the association convened various national goods groups and the Chicago Exposition product association three times to discuss and solicit opinions, it was decided to participate in the US and that 100 to 200 boxes of competition products would be collected and one representative would be sent to participate. However, regarding expenses such as collecting competition products, arranging the venue, representative allowances, employee salaries for the exhibition hall, publicity, water, electricity, printing, round-trip transportation, etc., the most conservative estimate is 20,000 yuan. It is proposed to submit the funding request to the Ministry of Industry for funding. The records are on file. It is true that the participation of various manufacturers in the Texas State Exposition this time is beneficial to the country's commercial and political affairs and has great benefits. However, in the current state of industrial and commercial depression, manufacturers are truly unable to bear the expenses. We urge your Ministry to follow the precedent of participating in the Chicago Exposition and provide funding to show encouragement. We have prepared a document for inspection and approval and ask for prompt approval and allocation of funds so that the association can begin preparing for collection and transportation to the US for participation. We are eagerly awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the negotiations on the factory inspection case in the Shanghai concessions have stalled, there have been various rumors circulating. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the consular body had recently met again to discuss further responses. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency went to the consular body's office yesterday to inquire and learned that this statement was absolutely untrue. The consular body is currently on summer vacation and has not had any meetings at all. The secretary of the consular body, Mr. Lang, went to Japan for summer vacation last month. His request to revise the draft agreement previously proposed by the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government was not a complete rejection, but rather contained flexibility and there was still room for negotiation.</p>

<p>More than 400 Chinese laborers returning from Russia, due to lack of livelihood, transferred to Shanghai by sea and took the round-trip shipping boat. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, sent personnel to receive them. It is estimated that more than 120 people temporarily stayed at the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Nanshi, and more than 300 people sought livelihood by visiting relatives and friends. Now, the Public Security Bureau has sent 80 people who stayed to Tianjin first, and the remaining 40 people were contacted by the Public Security Bureau and the China Merchants Bureau yesterday morning to be transported to their hometown of Qingdao free of charge to avoid being stranded.</p>

<p>This year's Jiangzhe Spring Cocoon Loan Group, jointly organized by banks and money shops in this city, began lending in early May, lending a total of more than 11 million yuan. The repayment period is limited to three months. Because the silk industry has improved this year, exports are booming, and prices are rising frequently, all silk merchants have made a great profit, so all loans have been repaid before the due date. The group is scheduled to hold a committee meeting next Wednesday (the 12th) at the group's office at the Bank of Communications to discuss the conclusion of matters and report on the loan processing situation. Whether to continue processing next year will also be discussed at the meeting.</p>

<p>Xu Deyu, a Yangzhou native who runs an inn at 67 Zhou Shan Road, has a six-year-old son named Kou Dingzi. The day before yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, Xu's nephew, Huo Weicai (age 18), took him out, ostensibly to Huishan Road to buy sugarcane scrapings. However, he conspired with Liu Shuzhi, a Jiangbei native living at 7 Bei Kai Er Road, to abduct the child. Liu took the child to live at the home of Dong Agui, a local resident at 235 Pingliang Road, intending to sell him for profit. After the incident was reported, the Huishan Concession police dispatched Chinese detective Zhao Yongqing to arrest Huo, Liu, and Dong. The child, Xu Kou Dingzi, was rescued and taken to the police station. The father retrieved the child. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a miscellaneous worker from the Public Works Department, explained the situation and requested prosecution. Subsequently, the victim Xu Deyu brought his son to testify to the events. When questioned, Huo and Liu stammered in their testimonies. Dong Agui claimed that Liu Shuzhi came with the child, saying he was just waiting for his brother to pick him up and that he was unaware of the abduction, pleading for leniency. Judge Xiao Bianfen sentenced Liu Shuzhi to one year and two months of imprisonment, and Huo Weicai to ten months. Before execution, they were ordered to undergo six months of reformatory education at a reformatory. Dong Agui was released.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Japanese Sailor Case Continues Investigation for Evidence - Old Man Yang Zengquan and Three Others Testify in Court Yesterday - Yang Wendao's Palm Print and Rust Inside Book Still Need to Be Analyzed - Ye Haisheng and Yang Wendao Both Wept Bitterly Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The three suspects in the murder case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, were escorted by the police to the First Special District Court yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Judge Xiao Xiefen specially opened the First Court to continue the investigation. Prosecutor Tang Peiyou and Clerk Ding Chongnan were also present. The Public Works Department's prosecuting lawyers Bo Liang, Ru Bao Yi, and Li Zhishan, as well as the defendants' defense lawyers Zhang Zhitian, Fan Gang, Tang Huaiqun, Wang Shizong, and Guo Qiming, all appeared in court. The Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau also sent Secretary Zhang Tingrong and Section Chief Huang Hua to observe the proceedings.</p>
<p>More than ten members of the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai</p>
<p>were present to observe. This was the second court hearing after the closure of the debate in the case. Since it was still a continuation of the investigation for evidence, there was no need for a special collegial panel. Therefore, Judge Xiao investigated the case independently. First, Lawyer Ru stated that Yang Jianzhong, whom the defendant Yang Wendao had implicated in the frame-up, had been repeatedly investigated by the police, but his whereabouts could not be found, so he could not be summoned to court for questioning. The police originally did not need him to testify. Since Yang Wendao</p>
<p>was framed by him,</p>
<p>he should bear the responsibility of providing evidence and finding Jianzhong. In addition, four witnesses who should be summoned have now been gathered. Judge Xiao immediately ordered Clerk Ding to read aloud the transcript of the visit to the scene of the incident on Doule'an Road by the witness Pan Qiaoying, a woman who was summoned from Gaoyou on the 28th of last month at 9 PM by the police and lawyers, during which Pan performed the situation of witnessing the murderer shooting down Nakayama Hideo. Then, he asked the three defendants about their</p>
<p>opinions on Pan's</p>
<p>statement. Yang and Zhou both shook their heads and said they had none. Ye claimed that Pan went into the stove shop after hearing the gunshot and could not have seen the murderer's appearance. Judge Xiao then explained in detail the reason why the originally scheduled continuation of the court hearing on the 31st of last month was not held as scheduled. He said that since the closure of the debate in the case, it was necessary to investigate and summon witnesses, so the hearing was scheduled for the afternoon of the 31st of last month. However, since the witness Pan Qiaoying, who was summoned from Gaoyou, had been</p>
<p>summoned to Shanghai</p>
<p>on the 27th and she could not wait, the hearing was advanced to the 28th for questioning about everything. After the questioning was completed, the scheduled date of the 31st could be cancelled. However, there were misunderstandings due to external rumors that did not know the truth. It should be known that the case is still in the process of investigating evidence. Also, the four witnesses summoned must be questioned separately, and many of the questions were related to Yang Wendao. Therefore, he ordered the bailiff to take Yang and the four witnesses out of the courtroom before questioning them one by one. First,</p>
<p>the seventy-three-year-old</p>
<p>old man Yang Zengquan was brought to the court and stated that his ancestral home was Zhongshan, Guangdong. He was engaged in printing in Shanghai and had an uncle-nephew relationship with Wendao. The Beishan Yang Clan Shanghai Association was established by the clansmen in Shanghai for more than ten years. The court immediately showed him two letters from the association to Wendao found in Wendao's home and questioned him about the matters mentioned in the two letters. After reading the letters, Zengquan said that the two letters were sent by the members after Wendao returned to his hometown last year because they learned that some clansmen had stolen public property. Therefore, they sent the letters to Wendao, asking him to stop them nearby. Although he was</p>
<p>the president of the association</p>
<p>at that time, he only knew the general situation of the matter. If detailed information was needed, please ask Yang Haichou. Subsequently, Yang Haichou, who was in his seventies, testified that he and Wendao were also distant uncle-nephews. In the past, because a certain clan chief in his hometown acted like a local tyrant, running rampant in the village and oppressing the people, and had more than ten henchmen under his command, he privately sold public land last year. The clansmen sent a letter asking for help. Wendao returned to his hometown, so the association sent a letter to Wendao, asking him to overthrow the clan chief. Because Wendao</p>
<p>had been away from his hometown for a long time,</p>
<p>they nominated seven good people in the village to assist him. The "help" mentioned in the letter refers to helping Wendao overthrow the clan chief, and the so-called "killing this scoundrel" also refers to dealing with the clan chief. He is currently imprisoned in Zhongshan County, etc. Yang Huiji, the secretary of the association, and Yang Junyi, a member, also came to court to testify that the purpose of the two letters sent by the association to Wendao was purely to ask him to work with the other seven people in his hometown to deal with the local tyrant and</p>
<p>maintain public property,</p>
<p>and there was no other purpose, etc. When questioned, the defendant Yang Wendao's statement regarding the letter was similar to that of the four witnesses. He also stated that he decided to return to Guangdong to send his uncle home. The court then read Ye Haisheng's confession at the police station that involved Yang Wendao and questioned Yang. Yang categorically denied it, saying that he had never engaged in political activities. Then he said that in the summer of the 21st year, he was introduced by a friend and once served as a senator of the 55th Army. At that time, the military headquarters was stationed in Baotou, but he was in Shanghai. He resigned after less than two months in office. As for the Tongren and Tongyi associations he founded, they were all for charitable purposes. Tongyi had been dissolved due to financial difficulties. He never knew Xie Chunji, who opened room number nine at the Yuegong Hotel, and had never been to Yuegong, etc. When questioned, Zhou Sherong admitted that he was a member of Tongyi and said that Xie Chunji was also introduced by him to join Tongyi last October. When he confessed to being arrested this time, he burst into tears and insisted that he had been framed. Ye Haisheng, who was standing shoulder to shoulder with Zhou, was also in tears,</p>
<p>sobbing and crying.</p>
<p>Regarding the various situations confessed at the police station, he said that none of them were sincere. They were all words of agreement. Therefore, among the names mentioned, there were not a few who did not exist. At that time, he only wanted to make up the numbers and did not hesitate to fabricate them. When Judge Xiao questioned this, he believed that it was necessary to send Yang Wendao's palm print and the rust found in the books found in Yang's home to the Forensic Medicine Research Institute for identification. It was also necessary to check and retrieve a certain case file from the Jiangsu Higher Court. Therefore, he decided to adjourn the hearing. The three defendants, Yang, Ye, and Zhou, were still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>On the night of April 17th of this year, a small cart driver named Chen was pushing a cart on Haig Road when he was hit and injured by a car driven by an American named Reiman. He later died in the hospital. Subsequently, Chen's wife filed a lawsuit in the US Court in China and demanded compensation of US$10,000 for the loss. The case was finalized on the 4th by Chief Judge Hillmik. Because Chen was pushing the cart on the left side of the road in accordance with the regulations at the time, and the defendant's car was driving on the right side of the road, it could be seen regardless of the darkness of the night, but it still hit his small cart and injured him. The negligence cannot be shirked, so the defendant was ordered to compensate Chen's wife with 2,160 yuan in Chinese currency to close the case.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 8:55, at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Xin Zha Bridge Road in the Public Concession, a man over fifty years old with a northern accent came to the Lu Gao Jian fresh meat shop. He took out a small silver coin worth four jiao and wanted to get back 200 wen to buy one jin of streaky pork. The shop only agreed to use the market scale. The old man insisted on using a balance scale, which caused a dispute. In disagreement, the old man immediately took a meat hook as a weapon and attacked people indiscriminately. The spectators all opened their eyes and dared not approach. Two shop assistants wanted to step forward to take the meat hook, but they were cut on the head, face, arms, palms, etc., and bled profusely. Fortunately, the Chinese police patrolling there heard the alarm and realized that the old man was a boxer.</p>
<h3 id="e140">French Concession Police Department - Vehicle Traffic Rules <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department, in view of the increased traffic in the concession, has studied various plans to avoid congestion at intersections and to facilitate traffic on major roads and cross streets, while ensuring the safety of pedestrians and the general public. The plan has been adopted and is now being implemented. Handcarts, small carts, and rickshaws are not allowed to travel on the following roads except for loading and unloading goods: Avenue Petain, Avenue Sieyes - from Avenue Petain to Avenue Terasse, Route Paul Henry from Avenue Massenet to Avenue Albert, Avenue du Parc from Avenue Dubail to Avenue Conty. If you want to load and unload goods on the above-mentioned roads, the vehicles should come from the cross street nearest to the destination, and must leave from the nearest cross street. All vehicles must park along the left side of the sidewalk according to the direction of travel, without obstructing traffic. Currently, all vehicles are not allowed to park at street corners or in areas listed on the police notice. Furthermore, in order to protect the sleep of residents in the concession, drivers of motor vehicles must not honk their horns indiscriminately at night, especially not to honk various horns at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Jianghai Customs Ordered to Prohibit Export of Waste Fluff - Representatives of Flying Flower Industry Petition in Beijing <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Changnian, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Ba Runsen, Tax Commissioner, jointly issued Notice No. 1536 yesterday, stating that they had received an order from the Ministry of Finance prohibiting the export of all waste fluff to foreign countries and ordering them to comply with it. Accordingly, they should comply with it and notify all merchants. This is a special announcement.</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prohibit the export of waste fluff, mistakenly prohibiting the export of "flying flower" samples, causing great panic in the flying flower industry. Waste fluff is commonly known as old cotton wadding, also known as old broken fluff, which is removed from old cotton quilts and old cotton clothes. The customs export tariff lists it as 185. The various flying flower scraps produced by the spinning mills that cannot be spun, which are usually exported in large quantities, are worth 10 million yuan in national currency annually. The customs export tariff lists it as No. 175. The two are completely different. However, yesterday and today, the flying flowers declared for export were rejected by the customs. Therefore, the Shanghai Flying Flower Industry Association held an emergency meeting and sent representatives Xie Zhongle and Bao Guoliang to Beijing by night train last night to petition the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and to submit samples of flying flowers and waste fluff to explain the truth, so that flying flowers would not be subject to the same prohibition on export as waste fluff.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Rental Books and Garbage Cans - Petitioning the Municipal Government to Prohibit Sales - Expression of the Real Estate Industry Association <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Landlords in Nanshi and Zhabei collect rent from tenants and must use the Anqing Bureau's rental books. At that time, the landlords believed that the price of the rental books was too high and sent representatives to petition the municipal government. Secretary-General Yu sincerely stated that the rental books should be sold at the cost of printing and can be publicly bid for printing. Later, the Public Security Bureau printed 200,000 rental books at a cost of 7 fen each and 300,000 sub-rental books at a cost of 6 fen each. Because the transportation, investigation, printing, and announcement costs were very high, it had to add subsidies in addition to the cost. Also, since it had a large stock of 200,000 printed rental books and 300,000 sub-rental books, if it needed to print more in the future, it could follow the merchant bidding method. The Real Estate Industry Association of this city, because this rental book has been issued for nearly four years, the Public Security Bureau's stored rental books should have been sold out. The special petition to the municipal government should announce the shadow merchant bidding printing method in advance and ask for advance notice for coordination. In addition, the Public Security and Health Bureaus stipulated that landlords should set up one garbage can per household, and those with two or more households within one dou must also have two or more garbage cans. At the beginning of the trial implementation, the landlords all thought that this equipment was limited to one time, so it might as well reluctantly comply. Unexpectedly, after nearly a year, this garbage can had to be replaced again. The police of the Public Security Bureau went to the door and forcibly sold one garbage can per household, regardless of whether the can was intact or not, at a price of one yuan each, and instructed the tenants to deduct it from the rent, turning it over to the landlords to bear. The market price of this garbage can is only six or seven jiao. The association petitioned the municipal government to publicly bid and ordered each tenant to purchase them on their own at cost, and not to deduct them from the rent, so that the Public Security and Health Bureaus should comply with it, and instruct the sub-bureaus not to send the police to force the sale of rental books and garbage cans to offset the rent.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Zhunlian Taoist Gao Dongliang - Father and Son Accuse Each Other of Disgrace - Extortion and Destruction of Marriage - Involving Woman Chui Haifen <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Gao Dongliang from Taizhou, who is over forty years old, has established a Zhunlian Society of Taoism in Zhabei and is now the old Taoist of the society. Recently, he suddenly filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing his stepson Jiang Wenzhao, along with Shen Zhaohuai, Li Zhaohan, Dai Yulong, and Jiang Wenhao, of intimidation and extortion. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff had been practicing Taoism and cultivating his nature, fasting and chanting scriptures for a long time. Because his tenant Ding Chui had a daughter named Haifen, who had an affair with the plaintiff's stepson Jiang Wenlu, they planned to get engaged on June 7th of this year and forced the plaintiff to be the witness. However, because he had already severed ties with this bastard and regarded him as a stranger, and Haifen had already been promised to Dai Erkai in her early years and could not remarry, they held a grudge. Therefore, the second defendant, Shen Zhaohuai, wrote a plan to bite, saying that the dissolution of Haifen's marriage was due to the plaintiff's destruction, and demanded 100 yuan for the losses incurred, and colluded with Shen Zhaohuai, Li Zhaohan, Jiang Wenhao, and Dai Yulong to come and extort in every possible way. On the 5th of this month, when the plaintiff's son Guixian was at home, he was extorted 8 yuan by the defendant, and it was still not enough. They came to the door every day to force extortion, making it difficult to live in peace. They also provoked and instigated his wife to divorce, creating a situation of restlessness in the house. Shen Zhaohuai and Dai Yulong specialize in fraud and are despised by others. Dai Yulong has also been punished and requested to be brought to justice together, etc. His stepson Jiang Wenzhao also filed a counterclaim, accusing him of slander, saying that in June of this year, Gao Dongliang, intending to rape his tenant Ding Zhong's daughter Haifen as a concubine, spared no effort to lose his conscience, acted perversely, used my name to repeatedly send letters to Haifen's fiancé Dai Erkai to arbitrarily destroy Hai's reputation, destroy the marriage, and put me in the law. Later, Haifen found out and sued in the court and was convicted. Now that the sentence has expired, he suspects that I revealed his secrets and holds a grudge. According to the complaint, the defendant is nominally a Buddhist, but in reality, he is collecting money, especially a hungry ghost of lust. Women's chastity is destroyed countless times. Even my mother is one of those who has been harmed. It is painful to say. As for the extortion of 8 yuan, etc., it is completely false and fabricated, and I request a counter-investigation, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hongduo opened the court to interrogate each of the parties to the claim and immediately announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 8th of this month.</p>

<p>According to the latest regulations on tuberculosis prevention, it is most effective to detect unconscious and latent pulmonary tuberculosis early in people who consider themselves healthy and to treat them before the disease develops. However, the symptoms of early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis are very subtle and difficult to distinguish. It is difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis without X-ray examination. Therefore, many cases of delayed diagnosis have occurred. Dr. Ding Huikang, director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in this port, has specially explored the latest X-ray group examination methods in various countries. Starting next week, examinations will be held at the Branch Hospital at 4 Daxi Road every Tuesday and Saturday morning. From now on, all groups or individuals only need to purchase an examination certificate from the museum. Each person only needs to pay one yuan and go to the registered time for examination. This examination is the first of its kind in our country and is of great benefit to the health of citizens.</p>

Xu Shiqi, a famous painter from Beijing, brought a large number of famous works to Shanghai to participate yesterday.

<p>Last night at approximately 10 PM, two men speaking with local accents went to the An'nan Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company to rent a car. One was wearing a black long gown and a straw hat, the other a black short shirt and blue cloth trousers. They stated they wanted to go to the Bei Dingjia Residence on Zhongshan Road. The company dispatched driver Liu Yongfu, car number 1718 (city license) and 18518 (rental license), to take them. After arriving near the Daxia University in the northern part of Zhongshan Road, the two men ordered the car to stop. They both got out and falsely told driver Liu Yongfu that they needed to visit a friend in the countryside, asking Liu to help them find the friend. Liu did not suspect anything and believed them, so he got out of the car and went with them into a bean field. Unexpectedly, the two men pulled out handguns and ordered Liu not to move. They bound his limbs with rope, stuffed cotton wadding into his mouth, and then searched his pockets, stealing eleven yuan in banknotes, a twelve-yuan and twenty-cent check from the National China Bank, two keys, and a police whistle. Liu's uniform was also stripped off him and worn by the bandits, who drove off in the original car. Liu struggled for a long time in the bean field before managing to free himself. He rushed to the nearby Zhongshan District, Sixth Sub-district Public Security Bureau派出所 to report the crime. The station relayed the information to the main bureau, which notified all city police agencies to assist in the search. As of the time this newspaper went to press, the car had not yet been found.</p>

<p>Chen Heming from Wenzhou runs the Gong Sheng Hotel in Guanqiao, Nanshi. Most of his traveling guests are peddlers from Zhejiang's Wenzhou, Chu, and Qingtian who are going overseas. Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau has strictly cracked down on the issuance of overseas passports, Chen came up with a wild idea and, together with colleagues Zhu Jieqing, Wu Guoliang, Wang Weide, Chen Dahua, Chen Junming, and others, forged overseas passports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, falsely printed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' seals, and various stamps. They also forged the seals and signatures of consulates in India, Trieste, Mumbai, etc. At first glance, it was difficult to distinguish the genuine from the fake. When twenty-one passports belonging to Wu Guifang, Li Aliang, and others were inspected as forgeries upon arrival in Marseille on the French post ship, they were immediately detained. The consulate was notified, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Municipal Government to arrest and bring Chen, Zhu, Wu, Wang, and others to court for public prosecution. Two preliminary hearings have been held. Because the victims were not all present, the case was adjourned for further questioning. According to inquiries made yesterday with the passport issuing authority in this city, it is difficult to investigate how many forged passports there are in total. There are many victims who were deceived and went overseas, scattered throughout Europe. Currently, there are already fourteen people who have been deported back to the country. Therefore, it is not easy to bring all of these victims to court for the time being.</p>

Yesterday, the issue was resolved through mediation by the Second Special District Citizens' Union and Mr. Zheng Ziliang. The workers expressed satisfaction.

<p>Indictment is Detailed</p>
<p>The facts are very clear, please make a judgment in accordance with the law. Finally, the court appointed duty lawyer Huang Menggang to defend the defendant, saying that in this case, based on the facts, there is not a single witness. According to the victim, the rape lasted a long time, but only the labia were injured and the hymen was not broken. It seems unlikely that a 21-year-old man raping an eight-year-old girl would cause such minor injuries. According to the defendant, there is a grudge, and the report was made ten days later, so the circumstances warrant further investigation. Please make a careful ruling. So far. The official announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the 8th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Suzhou Socialite: Lawsuit for Abandonment Adjudged, Gu Xuelin and Hua Fan Both Not Guilty <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xuelin, a woman from Suzhou, is 33 years old this year. She was previously married to a Chen姓 for 16 years, and has two sons and three daughters. But in August of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Gu was introduced at a banquet to Hua Dafan (also known as Dawei), a native of Changzhou who was the director of the Yucheng Feng Sugar Factory in Yongji Lane, North Zhejiang Road. At first sight, they fell in love. Hua told Gu at the time that he was still single and willing to marry her. If she did not agree, he would threaten to commit suicide. Gu was fooled and had a relationship with him. At the same time, she and her husband, Chen姓,</p>
<p>Tried to Get a Divorce</p>
<p>and lived with Hua Dafan. In the middle, a written agreement was signed, in addition to bearing expenses, and was willing to marry her with the etiquette of the principal wife. If one party changed his or her mind midway, the other party could claim 50,000 yuan in damages. Now Hua has suddenly abandoned Gu Xuelin, so Gu hired lawyer Gu Yongquan to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Hua Dafan of seduction and abandonment, and attached a private prosecution of 50,000 yuan. This case has been summoned by the Special Court once. Because the defendant did not arrive, the hearing was postponed to another date. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Another Continued Hearing</p>
<p>The defendant also arrived with his lawyer to respond to the lawsuit. The plaintiff, Gu Xuelin, immediately claimed that I married Chen姓 for 16 years. In August of the year before last, I met the defendant Hua Dafan through a friend at a banquet in Suzhou. On August 25th of the year before last, because I was socializing in Shanghai, I had just arrived at the Shanghai Railway Station, when the defendant was already waiting at the station, falsely claiming to take me to my sister's place, but he was taken directly to</p>
<p>Huizhong</p>
<p>Hotel. That night, the defendant wanted to have a relationship with me. I wanted to shout, but the defendant knelt on the ground and begged with a knife, saying that if I didn't agree, he would be willing to die. I was frightened in my heart, so I was raped. Then I lived with him, first in Sanyi Lane, Xinzha Road, and then moved to Suzhou. At that time, the defendant signed a written agreement, willing to marry me. Later, because the money I brought was all cheated away by the defendant, I couldn't return to Suzhou, and the matter was also known to my husband. Because I was instigated by the defendant, I divorced my husband. In total, I</p>
<p>Lived Together for Two Years</p>
<p>Until three months ago, the defendant abandoned me because I ran out of money and was dating another woman. The defendant confessed that he met the famous socialite Ms. Gu Xuelin through an introduction in Suzhou the year before last. It was discovered that Gu was the most dissolute and unrestrained figure in the Suzhou social scene. Because I failed to understand the dark side of social cunning, I fell in love with her. However, the plaintiff absolutely did not mention that she had a husband, and then began to live together. The plaintiff had successively drawn up</p>
<p>Two Written Agreements</p>
<p>declaring that she would never associate with any boyfriend again, and invalidated the newly established cohabitation contract. Unexpectedly, she was originally addicted to opium dens, and even though she knew I had no right to interfere, she arbitrarily dated boyfriends and did not return all night. I had no choice but to hire a lawyer to request the dissolution of the marriage from the Civil Court of Junyuan. Yesterday, I also paid the plaintiff's rent for breach of contract. Therefore, I have never had any seduction or abandonment. In addition to requesting a declaration of innocence, I also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and ordered the lawyers of both parties to</p>
<p>Begin the Debate</p>
<p>The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the defendant Hua Dafan is actually a swindler. Previously, he cheated Hengfengyong Gold Store out of 150 yuan in legal tender at the Yangtze Hotel under the pretext of reading faces, and falsely established a business name in Suzhou to design a trick. Not only did he defile people, but he also cheated people out of money, so he should be severely punished. Finally, the defendant's lawyer gave a defense. Judge Huang ruled in court that Hua Dafan and Gu Xuelin were both not guilty, and the incidental civil suit of the plaintiff was rejected.</p>

<p>Qian Zupei from Henan, also known as Qian Guodong, nicknamed Little Shandong, the Red Pill King, sells the No. 11 Red Pill manufactured by Lu Changfa, which sells nationwide and earns the name of King, and makes a lot of profit. In November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Shanfa Patrol House arrested and brought him to the Second Special Court and ordered him to be released on bail with 8,000 in cash, pending investigation. Unexpectedly, Qian escaped after being released on bail. An arrest warrant was issued, and it has been four years. Until last month, Qian came to Shanghai under the impression that the heat was dying down. The French Patrol House found out and, together with the Laozha Patrol House, arrested Qian at the Central Tea House on Guangxi Road, and brought him to the Second Special Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law, and a closing argument had been announced. The verdict was scheduled to be announced yesterday. It is now learned that the presiding judge believed that the case still required further investigation and could not be announced on schedule. Therefore, yesterday Judge Zhang attended the Criminal Court and brought Qian to court, announcing the withdrawal of the closing argument and scheduling a retrial on the morning of the 8th, reopening the debate.</p>

<p>Jin Yuanchang, a 22-year-old villager from Chenjialou Township, southwest of Luodian Town, Baoyi, and six companions loaded more than twenty dan of golden-skinned watermelons onto a small boat to sell them in Songjiang the day before yesterday. At about 6 PM in the afternoon, when they arrived at Wusong Wenzaobang, Xu Tujin's son, Xiao Rongbao, a boatman from the sampan, boarded the boat to take over the rowing in order to land at the ferry dock. Unexpectedly, just as they arrived at the Jin Guixing pier, due to heavy rain for days, the water was turbulent, and it was also low tide. Due to a moment of carelessness, the small boat was wrecked on a jellyfish boat parked in the harbor. Everything capsized, and both people and goods fell into the water. The watermelons filled the harbor. Nearby sampans came forward to help rescue them. Five people were rescued on the spot, but Jin Yuanchang drifted outward with the current and was unable to be rescued in time, resulting in a tragic drowning. The body has not yet been recovered. According to the boat gang, the current was so rapid at the time that the person had been washed into the sea, so it was not easy to find the body. Moreover, one or two people are bound to suffer a disaster every summer in Wenzaobang. Jin Yuanchang is the first person this year.</p>

<p>Liu Xilin, a native of Changzhou, works as a waiter at the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road. His son, Liu Zhengxing, 23 years old this year, is an apprentice at the Meizuishi 洋行 on Jiujiang Road, No. 211. He married three years ago. Ding Shunlin, a cook at Baolong Hospital and a native of Changzhou, and Liu are both from the same hometown and colleagues, so the two are very close. Ding's family lives at No. 71, Dongsiwen Lane, Datong Road. He has a daughter named Huiyun, 20 years old this year, who is not yet engaged. In May of the year before last, Liu Zhengxing visited Ding's house and developed a relationship with Ding Huiyun out of friendship. The two were deeply in love and made a marriage agreement, but Liu already had a wife, so the future was inevitably hindered. Ding Shunlin's position was that his daughter could not marry him unless Liu divorced his wife. Liu then proceeded with the divorce proceedings, but because his wife demanded a thousand gold pieces in alimony, Liu was unable to afford this huge amount, so it was not completed. Recently, the aunt of Ding's daughter acted as an intermediary for her daughter, the other party being a middle-aged man in his thirties and a widower. The daughter of course objected, but the family proceeded urgently, and Ding Shunlin had no intention of allowing Liu to meet his daughter again. At about 8 PM the night before last, when it was raining heavily, Liu Zhengxing suddenly came to Ding's house and invited the woman out to talk. The woman then went out with him. They first wandered around the entrance of the Xihai Grand Theatre for more than an hour, and then braved the rain to go to the Bund Park. When people were unprepared, they threw themselves into the river together. Fortunately, gardener No. 36, No. 82, and Chinese police officer No. 952 heard the alarm and rushed to rescue the two and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, it was still early, and they were both saved. Subsequently, after investigation by Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Bao Detective Jin Deshun of the General Patrol House, it was believed that Liu Zhengxing had incited suicide. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Patrol House, prosecuted him in accordance with Articles 275-1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. Quan You Ding said that it was not Liu who asked me to die with him, but that I saw Liu throw himself into the river, and I thought that there was no fun in living in the world, so I followed him into the river. After Feng Shide, the judge, finished questioning the Chinese police and Liu Zhengxing, he ordered the verdict to be announced next Monday, and Liu was allowed to post bail on call.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Le Zhenbao and Others Sued for Embezzlement Case Concluded, Sentencing on the 12th Morning <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association on East Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, jointly established by nine industry guilds, had its property managed by four directors: Le Zhenbao (owner of Taichang Linqi Store on Nanjing Road), Bei Runsheng (former manager of Ruikang Paint Company), Zhang Lanping (current manager of Ruikang Paint Company), and Xi Gengrong (manager of Hengli Bank). The Xiyanliao Industry Association of this city was also one of the guilds under the former association. Recently, it was discovered that the four individuals in charge of the property, Le, Bei, Zhang, and Xi, had engaged in acts such as abusing their authority, embezzling property, and destroying evidence. After deliberation by the Fourth Plenary Session of all representatives of the said industry association and the 18th executive and supervisory meeting, Shou Shangjie was unanimously elected as the agent, who then retained lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Xi Gengrong, and the other four individuals of concealing evidence, breach of trust and embezzlement, and requesting a legal trial. According to the intent of the lawsuit, there were sixteen businesses in the Xiyanliao industry that were affiliated with the Jiuye Gongsuo, or the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association, initiated by the defendants. At that time, during the European War, the pigment business was unusually prosperous, and the funds collected were substantial. The intention was to use these funds to build a guild hall when the industry flourished in the future. However, the Jiuye Gongsuo was originally formed by the merger of nine businesses, and the Xiyanliao industry formally established its own industry association in the 19th year of the Republic. Therefore, after negotiations, the association separated the sixteen businesses affiliated with the Jiuye Gongsuo. Regarding the related funds previously contributed by the industry, negotiations were also conducted to transfer them. After two reconciliations, an agreement was reached. Finally, the Foreign Goods Commercial Association would enjoy a monthly subsidy of 300 yuan from the Xiyanliao industry fund to cover its routine expenses. This agreement was mediated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and filed with the Social Affairs Bureau, treating it as a collective agreement. After more than a year of fulfillment, Le Zhenbao and others suddenly changed the name of the Foreign Goods Commercial Association to the Renyi Shanhui (Benevolence, Righteousness, and Charity Association) and transferred the entire public property, under the guise of charity. At the same time, they refused to pay the agreed-upon subsidy, leading to renewed disputes. The association believed that the property rights and obligations with the Foreign Goods Commercial Association still existed, and based on the subject of the Xiyanliao industry in the agreement, like the whole egg, only the shell remains. It should transfer with the home of the egg, so the association has the need to recover it. Subsequently, the association discovered that the defendants were suspected of criminal acts in the disposal of public property, such as never reporting or disclosing annual accounts, repeatedly changing the name of the association's fund, covering the inscribed stone tablet with lime, and depositing all the proceeds into Xi Gengrong's own Hengli Bank for convenient use and investment in private enterprises. They believed that this constituted breach of trust and embezzlement and requested that the defendants be sentenced according to the law for their crimes. The case was heard twice by Judge Chen Shuoying, who ordered a postponement each time. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the court continued the hearing. Plaintiff Ma Shangjie and his lawyers were present, and the defendants and their lawyers, Wu Linkun and Yan Yinwu, were also present. After the court questioned both parties, their statements were the same as before. After the questioning, the judge ordered opening statements. The lawyers on both sides gave eloquent arguments for over an hour. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for 8:00 AM on the 12th.</p>

<p>Liu Dinan, a special agent of the Special Task Force of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, apprehended abductors Hu Lianzhi and Ma Xiaoying on the 20th of last month in Xiamen and rescued abducted boys Wang Xiaoman, aged eight, a native of Jiangbei, whose father's name is Wang Zhengxing and who lives at No. 13, Jixing West Lane, Tongzi Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, and Wang Xiaomao, aged four or five. Because of their young age, they have no description to offer. In addition to transferring the abductors Hu Lianzhi and the abducted children to the Xiamen District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation, the bureau also sent an official letter No. 3743 of the Fa character to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting it to find and summon the families of the aforementioned lost children to identify them so that they can be reunited with their families. Therefore, Director Cai Jinjun specially instructed Director Liao Jiongran of the Xinzha Branch Bureau to send police officers to investigate, but no families of the aforementioned lost children have come forward to claim them. Therefore, they reissued posters and pasted photos of the two children, inviting the families or guardians of the lost children to come and identify them. If they are positively identified, they can take the bureau's official document to Xiamen to retrieve the lost children, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly weak. The environment was good, and although morale was firm, the longs suddenly came out of the cage at high prices. The price raisers initially had surplus courage but then had to temporarily avoid the limelight. The market price went from a state of uncertainty to weakness. Market rumors were not worth discussing. Therefore, the future may slightly rebound due to the longs coming out of the cage. The trend will inevitably be temporary and not long-lasting and will still be a situation of easy rise and difficult fall. The process yesterday, the opening initial auctions, firm but not pretty, the rising momentum was already covered by the longs coming out of the cage and turned weak. Ding fell by three and a half jiao. The longs such as No. 10, No. 33, and No. 52 had a lot of outcries. However, there were more retail investors coming in, with only No. 35 buying in.

Therefore, the three types of A, B, and C all rose by one or two jiao to three and a half jiao. The secondary market's morale therefore slightly strengthened. However, the outcries of No. 33 and No. 52 were still fierce. Therefore, after Ding recovered one or two jiao, it suddenly became dispirited. Buyers waited and watched slightly, and the decline gradually became severe. A fell by five and a half jiao. As a result, the market price, except for C which slightly rose by five points this month, fell across the board by five points to one jiao to three and a half jiao, etc. The total number of transactions was 5,745,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening and falling madly. It can be said that overseas yarn and cotton market conditions are uniformly trending downstream. At the same time, warehouse yarn stocks are still over 10,000 bales.

The current month yarn has reached 201 yuan and 1 jiao. However, according to current yarn merchants, the marked yarn price is already lower than the spot price by two or three yuan. Therefore, customer groups of three bought about 500 bales, and there is a slight trend of liquidity.</p>

<p>The decline in Chenhua cotton for August was due to the fact that American cotton private estimates all saw an increase, and the sudden drop of more than 20 pounds broke the one jiao two point barrier, so the market was shaken, the longs cut, the shorts added code, both sides galloped forward, and the market fell step by step. The October period also broke the one yuan mark,</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of American cotton and news from Liverpool were unfavorable. Private estimates indicated an increase in supply. Liverpool and Southern sellers were active, and small-scale long positions were closed out. Prices for various months fell by six to ten points. Dealers and short sellers were the largest buyers, but resistance remained mediocre. Buyers were hesitant, awaiting the release of the government report. The current market price has fallen below the level before the July 8th report was published. The market situation remained sluggish at the close. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 points, and futures prices fell by 19 to 24 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 16 to 19 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by operators and closing out of long positions, with futures traders dumping their holdings.

<p>Yesterday, due to the consistent weakness of yarn prices both domestically and internationally, sentiment was weak, and purchasing interest was greatly reduced. White cotton cloths such as fine cloth, fine twill, 84 cloth, and city cloth, among Eastern goods, each fell by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Dyed cloths such as Four Gentlemen serge and Zhigong fell by 7.5 cents per piece. Other patterned cloths and white cloths from local factories maintained their original prices. Transactions were not brisk, and the market was quiet. Single-thread serge and Zhigong from local factories, as well as mid-to-lower grade fine cloth and fine twill, were in relatively strong demand. Henan merchants showed the strongest purchasing interest, continuously buying hundreds of pieces of serge from factories such as Dacheng, Qingfeng, and Meiheng, as well as various brands of blue cloth and colored twill. Merchants from Hankou and Changsha were actively purchasing lower-grade fine cloth, fine twill, serge, Zhigong, crepe, and white flannel from local factories, as well as printed flannel and other goods. Merchants from Sichuan were also shipping over 200 pieces of floral flannel, bleached flannel, Shilin cloth, blue cloth, and Yuanslash cloth. Merchants from Guangdong and Yunnan had weak purchasing interest. Yesterday, merchants from Yunnan bought nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth, colored crepe, floral flannel, and Shilin cloth from Mufang. Wholesale stores on this street bought over 100 pieces of floral and plain Zhigong serge from the Lunchang factory, as well as small amounts of fine and coarse cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Yin Feng Flannel Rises Very Rapidly <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the textile market gradually became more active, and merchants were coming to market more often. The Japanese "6000" Yin Feng flannel was selling well with merchants from Changsha and Yu Rong. However, due to a lack of inventory in Shanghai, supply could not meet demand, and prices rose accordingly. Last week, 2.6-foot Yin Feng Yuan flannel sold for 77 cents, but now it has jumped to 83.5 cents net. Its price increase cannot be described as slow. If no new goods are received within ten days, the price should continue to rise. Judging from the recent trend of tight supply and strong sales, it could jump to 90 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Grains: Japanese Merchants Continue to Purchase; Wheat Cash Price Rises, Futures Rebound <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market opened with softness across all months, due to a sharp decline in foreign wheat prices. Market sentiment was uniformly moderate. However, outside speculators were largely selling, and inside shorts were taking advantage to cover their positions, so the decline in each month was only about one, two, four, or five cents. According to the current domestic situation, wheat prices are trending upwards. It is said that the wheat market in Wuxi has opened to 7.15 yuan, which is already higher than the price in Shanghai. Therefore, future trends may be difficult to reverse downwards in the short term. As for the cash wheat situation, Japanese merchants are continuously purchasing. It is said that brokers are mostly inspecting samples themselves, without going through the hands of experts. Medium-grade goods are fetching 55 to 60 cents, and special high-grade goods are at 4.7 to 4.8 yuan, with 2,000 to 3,000 bags traded. On the Shanghai factory side, due to weak arrivals, customers are pushing hard to sell high-grade goods, and the factory is finding it difficult to resist further. Special high-grade goods have reached 4.7 yuan, a significant increase of 10 cents compared to the previous day, while medium-grade goods are up by 5 to 6 cents. A total of 8,000 to 9,000 bags were opened in the general market.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Standard Flour Rebounds Slightly Due to Covering <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened, all months remained quiet. Foreign wheat quoted one price, with Chicago falling by 80 to 90 cents and Canada falling by 1.1 to 1.2 yuan. When the opening price was quoted, sentiment for the current month was slightly more moderate due to the decline in foreign wheat, and the opening price was only 3.11 yuan, one cent away from the limit price. However, in subsequent trading sessions, the trend rebounded due to floating shorts covering, rising by 7.5 li, still within the limit price. The main reason is that actual sales have recently slowed down slightly, so many long positions have been disposed of. As for the months from September onwards, since foreign wheat only fell for one day, sentiment remained firm, and all stood at the limit price. Future trends will depend on foreign wheat prices.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Inexhaustible Supply, Rising Wind of Ke Xian <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian and Ke Hua rice remained active. In addition to merchants on this street and from the mainland, merchants from Sichuan and Guangzhou Ningbo were also very active, but the volume of sales was not as strong as in previous days. Coupled with the inexhaustible supply, domestic merchants were willing to sell. After the market price had risen for several days, more goods arrived from all directions, and the owners also wanted to sell as soon as possible to avoid being squeezed out by new goods. Therefore, the rising wind has been thwarted, and the market has become stable. If the sales path becomes strong again in the future, the market price may be able to gradually recover. A total of 3,450 bags of various Jiangxi rice, 1,000 bags each of Xiang Jing Sha rough rice, were opened for sale, with this street being the most active buyer. Merchants from Sichuan and Guangdong each bought 1,000 bags, while merchants from Ningbo and other places in the mainland only made small purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Dongxin Japonica Rice Arrives Sparsely, Price Rises <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments arrived from various merchants totaling 16 or 17 shipments, with a total of 3,200 to 3,300 dan. Sales on this street were even more sluggish. Merchants from Qinhuangdao bought only one hundred and ten bags, so the market situation showed a sign of softening. High-grade Houzao Japonica rice prices were reduced by nearly 10 cents, while medium-grade rice depreciated by a few cents. Good-quality Boda rice fell by one scale, while medium-grade rice fell by about two scales. Doyang Jian rice was scarce and barely managed to hold its price. Yinbian Yuan rice had no fluctuations. Yesterday, Xinchang factory shipped 40 shi of Dongxin rice. Due to continuous rain, supplies were occasionally cut off, and the price increased by 20 cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten shipments arrived from various merchants downstream.

<p>(Berlin) The Olympic Games held the pole vault preliminary round at 10:30 am on the 5th. The qualifying standard was 3.80 meters. Our national athlete Fu Baolu cleared the bar on his second attempt, becoming the only Chinese athlete to participate in the finals. At the same time, in the discus preliminary round, only those who could exceed 44 meters were allowed to qualify. Our national athletes Guo Jie and Leng Peigen both failed to qualify and were eliminated. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chinese pole vaulter Fu Baolu qualified in today's pole vault preliminary, clearing a standard height of 12 feet 6 inches. Leng Peigen and Guo Jie were eliminated in the discus preliminary, both failing to throw past the standard distance of 144 feet 4 inches. Chen Baoqiu withdrew from this competition. (Reuters, 5th) In today's Olympic soccer match, our country will play against the English team. The match will start at 4 pm Berlin time, which is around 11 pm Shanghai time. Unfortunately, our country will face the home of soccer in the first match. However, England's amateur soccer is not as strong as we imagined. At that time, our team's athletes will definitely give them a very fierce resistance. However, due to the time difference between Europe and Asia, it is not yet known whether the results of this match can be received tonight.</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Olympic pole vault finals were held at 4 pm on the 5th. Our national athlete Fu Baolu cleared 3.80 meters, but failed to clear 4 meters, and was eventually eliminated.</p>

However, this record was not destined to last long, as the German Lange equaled this record with one jump. But Owens then improved upon his previous preliminary record, advancing it to 7.97 meters. However, the black star Owens still felt unsatisfied and wanted to go even further. So, he jumped again and achieved 8.06 meters, reaching the peak of perfection, deserving of all praise. Thus, Owens won another gold medal. The German Lange took second place with 7.87 meters, and the Japanese Tajima Naoto was third with 7.74 meters. The remaining three places went to the Italian Maffa, the German Leichum, and the American Clark. The top two had scores of 7.73 meters, while Clark had 7.67 meters.</p>

<h3 id="e221">In the Issue of Women's Fitness, the Most Important Problem to Pay Attention to is Menstrual Regulation; Maintaining Regular Menstruation Leads to a Healthy and Beautiful Body; Taking Fotz’s Dang Gui Su Can Regulate Menstruation and Nourish Blood <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>A healthy mother is necessary for a healthy baby. This is why women's health should be the first priority. Women's health is based on menstruation. If there are pathological changes in menstruation, then normal health is lost, and this violates the principles of health.</p>
<p>Women's menstruation, with healthy eggs, is necessary for healthy embryos, and is related to human reproduction, which is of utmost importance. In the past, women were deeply secluded and did not connect with the world. Therefore, they did not know the times and were often stubborn. Liver disease was deep-seated, and exercise was neglected. Modern women have many social interactions, advocate liberation, and set foot in the market. The disadvantages of indulgence are becoming more profound, and menstrual diseases are becoming more obvious. Some are due to excessive labor in poor families, or due to family oppression and excessive restraint. Excessive games lead to wandering thoughts, and excessive worry leads to stagnation of qi. All of these factors can lead to menstrual diseases.</p>
<p>The way to regulate menstruation is to eliminate disease first. Those who suffer from diseases that lead to irregular menstruation should have their diseases treated, and then the menstrual disease will be cured naturally. This is the so-called etiological therapy. For example, excessive sorrow, or anger harming the liver, or poor relief, or abnormal fright, can cause qi and blood to merge and nerves to be affected, which is commonly known as neurasthenia. Blood follows the flow of qi, and when qi is sick, blood is sick. Traditional medicine says that heat comes before menstruation, and stagnation comes after. The reasoning is similar, but it should not be taken too literally. For example, if the internal organs are empty and menstruation drips continuously and frequently, it should not be judged as heat. Also, if there is internal heat, blood depletion, and slow and uneven menstrual flow, it should not be judged as cold. One must examine the combined symptoms. If the pulse is rapid and there is internal heat, dry lips and mouth, and aversion to heat and preference for cold, then there is heat. If the pulse is slow and cold, the tongue is pale and the mouth is neutral, and there is a preference for heat and aversion to cold, then there is cold. If menstruation is heavy in flow and bright in color, then there is excess blood. If there is little blood and the color is pale, then qi is stagnant and the abdomen is coagulated. If there is emptiness and pain during menstruation and one likes to press with their hands, then qi is deficient and blood is low. Those who suffer from this symptom should take "Foz’s Dang Gui Su" internally, which is a simple and effective treatment for the family. After taking it for several weeks, it will definitely regulate the menstrual cycle and restore healthy beauty.</p>
<p>Dang Gui is the root of Dang Gui, a material of the category , produced in various parts of the central part of our country. It is a sacred medicine for gynecology and can make qi and blood return to their respective places, hence the name. Shen Nong's Materia Medica and Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica both recognize Dang Gui as the only sacred product for nourishing blood, regulating menstruation, warming the palace, and pregnancy. Dr. Hillt, a German gynecological expert, studied Chinese medicine and used scientific methods to extract the effective ingredients of Dang Gui produced in China. After repeated animal experiments, all the results were amazing. Therefore, the Western medical community recognizes Dang Gui as a special medicine for gynecology, and many new doctors in our country also appreciate its use.</p>
<p>"Foz’s Dang Gui Su" is improved and prepared based on our country's ancient and proven prescriptions, Dang Gui San, Dang Gui Yin from Women's Good Prescription, Dang Gui powder from Must-Work Prescription, Dang Gui Pills from Universal Relief Prescription, Dang Gui Decoction from Sacred Blessing Prescription, etc. Therefore, it has a history of thousands of years of clinical experience, and our factory also selects domestic Dang Gui and uses a vacuum distiller to extract its essence with scientific methods for improvement and preparation. Its effect is indeed superior to foreign-made Dang Gui essence, and it is very convenient to take and carry.</p>
<p>According to a report by gynecological expert Dr. Ann: "Dang Gui Su" was administered to fourteen patients with dysmenorrhea and four patients with amenorrhea, all with satisfactory results. Those with dysmenorrhea experienced gradual relief from pain, and all other unpleasant symptoms were swept away. Those with amenorrhea had their menstrual flow restored to normal. Two female patients had abnormally small uteruses, and famous doctors believed that they could not be treated. Finally, they tried using Dang Gui Su, and gradually restored physiological menstruation. This kind of effect is truly amazing.</p>
<p>In summary, the function of "Foz’s Dang Gui Su" is to specifically treat women's qi and blood deficiency and irregular menstruation – whether it is early or late, heavy or light, absent for more than a month, or twice in a month, stopped menstruation, painful menstruation, red and white leucorrhea, cold pain in the lower abdomen, long-term infertility, cold uterus and infertility, and all kinds of symptoms before and after childbirth. It truly has an incredible effect.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</p>
<p>Football Team's Performance</p>
<p>Our football team departed from Shanghai on May 2nd and has since traveled to the islands of Southeast Asia and India. For over two months, they have played 27 matches, with the exception of four draws, they have not lost once. Their results can be described as very satisfactory. Moreover, these four draws were all due to the players being too physically exhausted. For example, in the final match in Mumbai, the entire team traveled for two days and two nights by train from Calcutta, arriving in Mumbai on the morning of July 8th and playing in the afternoon. Naturally, their strength was greatly diminished. It is truly remarkable that they have maintained their victorious reputation amidst such arduous travel. However, the strength of the football teams participating in the World Games is very strong, especially those from the two small South American countries and various European countries, which are the most formidable. If we want to achieve good results in the games, we still need to put in extra effort and strive harder. All team members are determined to do so, which is reassuring to the people of our nation.</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Rong Qizhao, the director of the football department, manager Huang Jiajun, captain Li Huitang, and several other players on the ship. According to them, although the past two months of competition have been very tiring, their football skills have greatly improved. The most significant improvement is that the entire team has a mutual understanding, and their cooperation is extremely refined. The team's movements are also very fast, which is completely different from before they left the country. As for all the matches, most of them were very exciting and satisfactory. In a few matches, due to physical conditions, they were unable to fully demonstrate their strength. All team members were able to pay attention to sportsmanship, leaving a very good impression on the audience everywhere. Some places have always been very contemptuous of China, thinking that Chinese people are all opium addicts. This time, seeing our team perform so wonderfully, they were very surprised. They finally vented a grievance for the country. After two months of hard fighting, all team members inevitably suffered minor injuries, but nothing serious. There are a total of twenty-two players on the team, but the World Games only allows fifteen players per team. Although our official lineup has been largely finalized, it still depends on each person's physical condition during the journey before a concrete decision can be made. Therefore, it will not be officially announced until we arrive in Berlin. Regarding the issue of Li Huitang's amateur status, there was once a dispute in domestic public opinion. The Sports Advancement Association decided that Li himself should submit a written report to the association. The association has recorded this decision and delivered it to Li on the 13th. It is expected that there will be a formal response within a few days. According to Li, he has been writing dispatches along the way and only submitting them to Shen Bao for publication because he hopes that the Qin Fen Bookstore will publish a separate edition for him in the future. He has not received any financial remuneration, so he is not violating amateur rules, and there is no problem attending the games. Now, the results of the two months' battles are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Goal scorers: Li Huitang 28, Tan Jiangbai 18, Sun Jinshun 17, Feng Jingxiang 11, Yang Shuiyi 8, Ye Beihua 7, Zheng Jiliang 6, Zhuo Shijin 4, Cao Guicheng 4, Jia Youliang 3, Chen Zhenhe 3, Huang Meishun 2.</p>
<p>The Winds and Waves in the Arabian Sea</p>
<p>At noon on July 9th, the postal ship left Mumbai, heading from Asia to Africa in the Arabian Sea. The destination is Massawa, the capital of Italian Eritrea. When the postal ship set sail, the Indian athletes on board and the Indians seeing them off on the shore waved their hands and handkerchiefs to bid farewell, reminding us of the scene when we left Shanghai.</p>
<p>The sea voyage from Mumbai to Massawa is a total of 2,080 nautical miles, and the voyage takes six days, making it the longest leg of the journey. The winds and waves in the Arabian Sea from June to August are known for being dangerous. This time, they indeed gave our athletes a very large demonstration, and everyone fully experienced the taste of terrifying waves. Even when the reporter was writing, everyone was still disoriented and their souls were not settled. Less than an hour after leaving Mumbai, a huge gale and terrifying waves fiercely attacked us. The athletes who were enjoying the sea view on the deck and chatting and playing in the smoking room watched one by one as they retreated to their bedrooms. Afterwards, the wind and waves became more intense. The fierce sea breeze seemed to make terrible roars like mountains collapsing and the ground cracking. The surging waves rose like a small mountain, and the huge waves desperately hit the ship's hull, with splashes reaching two or three feet high, splashing straight onto the deck, like a storm of strong winds and heavy rain. The ship rose and fell by a distance of ten or twenty feet. When walking, it was like riding the clouds and mist, swaying uncertainly. At this time, there was indeed no one on the deck, and the smoking room was also deserted and lifeless. The two European waiters in the bar were so idle that they had nothing to do.</p>
<p>The athletes all lay down in their bedrooms, moaning, complaining, and many even vomited the bitter water in their stomachs, which was even more painful. The small ventilation windows in the bedrooms were tightly closed to avoid splashing waves, and the air was very dirty. Iron Bull Chen Baoqiu, who did not get seasick, opened the iron window to change the air because Wu Bixian, who was in the same room, vomited all over the floor. A huge wave hit in, filling the room with seawater. He hurriedly called the waiter to clean it up, and a total of five lead buckets of salt water were removed, scaring Iron Bull so much that he stuck out his tongue and could not retract it for a long time. The magnitude of the wind and waves can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The dining room was deserted for several days, with less than twenty people for early and afternoon tea, and less than fifty people for lunch and dinner. Most of them only drank a few sips of soup and ate a little fruit before finishing.</p>
<p>Among the teams, the basketball team had the most people getting seasick. Except for Yu Jingxiao, none of the other thirteen athletes were immune to seasickness. Wang Hongbin and Wang Yuzeng were the worst. Perhaps it was because they were all northerners and not used to sea life.</p>
<p>The football team was probably too tired. Except for Little Black Tan Chen Zhenhe, no one was immune to seasickness, not even Xu Yahui, who studied aviation. Li Huitang had a fever and chills and slept for two days after boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Only Zhang Erding and Zhai Lianyuan of the nine national arts representatives could hold on. The four representatives of race walking were all dizzy and flushed.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong had a fever and chills for two days, and Chen Zhenxing could not eat or sleep. The two fish could not do anything in the sea.</p>
<p>The boxing team was relatively better, but Wang Runlan lay down during the period of the storm and never got up.</p>
<p>Wu Bixian was the worst in the track and field team. Jia Lianren, Dai Shuguo, Wang Zhenglin, and Lin Shaozhou were also unwell. The others were not bad. Li Sen was able to read and write in the smoking room, which was truly rare.</p>
<p>The weightlifting team was the strongest. Weng Kangting, Shen Liang, and Huang Sheji practiced lifting iron bars whenever they had the opportunity. Shen Liang's performance even improved.</p>
<p>Of the thirty-odd old scholars in the inspection group, less than ten could be seen. Xu Yingchao and Xian Qu, who got seasick as soon as they left Wusongkou, need not be mentioned. Even Chen Dehe and Yuan Dunli, who were always boastful, vomited profusely. The female members were even more hidden without a trace.</p>
<p>Among the journalists, except for the reporter, the rest were not business-minded. As soon as they boarded the ship, they lay in bed. Mao Yixin of the Shishi Xinbao vomited so much that his hands and feet cramped. Luo Gusun of the International Photography Agency just sighed and groaned while lying down.</p>
<p>Everyone was so exhausted from seasickness for four days that the winds and waves gradually calmed down on the evening of the 12th, after the postal ship sailed past Socotra Island in the Gulf of Aden. Everyone felt as if they had been granted amnesty in prison and were all overjoyed. However, after this fatigue, everyone was worried about whether they would be able to recover their energy after a week of rest in Berlin.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Popular Education Vehicle and the Future of New Education in China (II) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Professor Mei Goden, Educator at the University of New York City, USA; Translated by Liu Wufu</p>
<p>In the rural areas of the suburbs, we can often see these self-service teachers at work. In a suitable open space or by the side of the road, he can set up a mobile outdoor school. The first step is to attract people's attention with exhibits. Pedestrians will look for items that interest them, such as powder to kill crop pests, improved soybean seeds from Jinling University, American corn, white cotton seeds from Jiangning County, and so on. When the teacher has aroused sufficient interest, he can begin to talk about his school. While talking, he also moves. He changes the setting, takes the box lid off to use as a blackboard, and the folding stools attached to the box can be used as seats. If needed, it can seat forty people. The school distributes small slates for writing. Here, it is strangely close to the situation in America. When the Lancaster plan for class systems was established at the end of the previous century in New York, they used Victorian-era slates to reduce costs. Today, it is common for Chinese adults and rural elementary school students to use slates.</p>
<p>However, the teachers of the "Nian Er" (Read Two) movement are not just ordinary teachers of basic writing and arithmetic. He should have two jobs. Their aim is to give rural farmers a real education and secondly to help them with new economic development. The educational success of this movement has already been discovered. Those who learn from him all understand the elements of healthy behavior, preliminary Chinese history, and China's position in the modern world, instructing them to correct improper behavior, such as the use of cosmetics and anesthetics, gender relations, gambling and urination in public places, forcing everyone to develop manual production skills, such as the manufacture of chopsticks, planning their improved simple manual techniques, and by providing technical assistance, enabling the public to move from the manual arts stage to the era of socialized crafts.</p>
<p>The organization of economic cooperation among the educated is the second part of the teacher's work. In each region, the Nian Er Society is the leader of the organization, managing the public places in the entire region. This is the center for various nearby residents, such as animal management, horticulture, miscellaneous farming, weaving, laundry, and cart pulling. Each Nian Er Society has its own elected leaders. The Nian Er Society is a cooperative unit of a larger cooperative organization. The entire movement eventually formed a large economic combination. The public consumes as much as possible the goods they produce themselves. For example, the teachers of the Nian Er Society wear homespun clothes, which are woven by the local people themselves, and sell the products to some school stores.</p>
<p>Attached to this plan is a very interesting method, which is that those who participate in cooperative economic activities must learn the designated events. The library is used to supplement school activities, and reading pamphlets and printed materials are distributed. Simple tests are used to prove the work of the educated. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e225">Outline for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The General Outline for Implementing Remedial Education for Out-of-School People has been revised and approved by the Executive Yuan. According to the Ministry of Education, in order to enable out-of-school people who are over the compulsory education age to gradually receive remedial education in the short term, the Ministry has specially formulated this outline, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. After receiving the Executive Yuan order, the Ministry will issue it to the various education departments along with the implementing rules that are being drafted, so that they can be earnestly followed. The following provisions have been learned from the outline: All out-of-school people should receive the following remedial education: A. Civic education (focusing on national consciousness and knowledge of modern life); B. Literacy education. In addition, self-defense training may be implemented. Each province and city should implement it from the 25th year and popularize it within six years. Each province and county should add civil schools every year, from 20 to 40 schools. Each school should run at least two terms each year, each term lasting three months to six months. First, implement supplementary education for out-of-school men and women aged 16 to 30, and then continue to extend it to older people. Compulsory measures may be taken during implementation. Each county and city should, starting from the 25th year, extract funds from the county education funds to supplement this supplementary education fund. If it is insufficient, it may be subsidized by the province. The textbooks for the civil schools will be compiled and printed by the Ministry and distributed free of charge to the civil schools. There should also be broadcasting and film auxiliary equipment. Each province and city should submit the implementation plan to the Ministry for approval by July 15th each year. The plan for the 25th year should be submitted to the Ministry by September 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Jie Zitui <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Bi</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn period, in the state of Jin, Duke Xian was in power. He favored a concubine named Ji. Ji wanted her own son to be the crown prince, so she plotted to harm the current crown prince, Shensheng. She also spoke many slanders in front of Duke Xian, saying that Prince Yiwu, Prince Chong'er, and Crown Prince Shensheng were conspiring to rebel. Duke Xian believed her and sent people to kill the two princes. However, the two princes fled.</p>
<p>Duke Xian of Jin had many sons, among whom Prince Chong'er was the best person and most respectful to scholars. Therefore, many people gathered around him. People like Zhao Cui, Hu Yan, Jiu Fan, Jie Zitui, and Wei Zhun were all top figures in the state of Jin. When Prince Chong'er fled the state of Jin, these virtuous men followed him. Prince Chong'er wandered outside for nineteen years. When there was internal strife in the state of Jin, he relied on the strength of the state of Qin to return to the state of Jin, ascended the throne, and was known as Duke Wen. With the assistance of these virtuous men, he became a hegemon.</p>
<p>It is said that Duke Wen of Jin, with the help of the state of Qin, prepared to return to his homeland. One day, he arrived at the edge of the Yellow River. This Yellow River flowed down from the northwest, with mud and sand carried in the water, tumbling and rolling like ten thousand horses galloping. It was truly a scene of wind howling and turbulent waves reaching the sky. It is unknown how many turtles, fish, shrimps, and crabs were in the water, pushing the waves along.</p>
<p>Duke Wen of Jin and his entourage arrived at the bank of the Yellow River. Duke Mu of Qin said a few words wishing them success and then returned in his carriage. Only the Qin soldiers escorting Duke Wen of Jin back to his country and the virtuous men under Duke Wen of Jin remained on the riverbank. The ships on the Yellow River were already prepared.</p>
<p>The group boarded the ships, ready to set sail. Jiu Fan suddenly said to Duke Wen of Jin, "Your servant has followed you in exile for nineteen years and knows that I have not made any contributions. On the contrary, I have made many mistakes. Now that you have returned to your country and ascended the throne, it can be considered a success. Your servant will bid farewell to you here."</p>
<p>Jiu Fan was speaking ironically. He was afraid that Duke Wen of Jin would forget his merits. Duke Wen of Jin also knew this, so he said, "This time, returning to the country relies entirely on everyone's strength. I am willing to swear to the River God that I will definitely reuse Jiu Fan!"</p>
<p>As Duke Wen of Jin spoke, he took a piece of jade and threw it into the Yellow River, thus making a vow with Jiu Fan. Jiu Fan thanked him. At this time, Jie Zitui was on the boat. Seeing Jiu Fan's behavior, he could not help but laugh. "The prince has the opportunity to return to his homeland and ascend the throne, which is what should be, and can also be said to be the good fortune of the state of Jin. Jiu Fan, however, claims it as his own merit. We followed the prince in exile for nineteen years, originally wanting to use the prince's position and strength to return to our homeland, make our homeland strong, and accomplish something great. Now, Jiu Fan doesn't even want to establish merit, but first uses his 'merit' to blackmail the prince. It would be fine if it were real merit, but it doesn't even count as merit. It's truly shameful!"</p>
<p>Therefore, Jie Zitui looked down on people like Jiu Fan and was unwilling to associate with them. After crossing the Yellow River and reaching the territory of the state of Jin, Jie Zitui took advantage of the chaos to leave the main group and returned to his hometown alone, taking care of his mother and living the life of an ordinary citizen.</p>
<p>Duke Wen of Jin could not find Jie Zitui. After investigating, no one knew where he had gone, so he had to give up. Later, when Duke Wen of Jin ascended the throne, pacified the country, and greatly rewarded meritorious officials, he had long forgotten about Jie Zitui. Jie Zitui also did not go to Duke Wen of Jin to claim his own merit.</p>
<p>One day, Jie Zitui's neighbor, Jie Zhang, learned that Duke Wen of Jin had greatly rewarded meritorious officials, but Jie Zitui's name was not on the list. He went to Jie Zitui's house to persuade him.</p>
<p>After the two sat down in the thatched cottage, Jie Zhang said, "You followed the prince in exile for nineteen years. Now that the lord has greatly rewarded meritorious officials, Grand Tutor Zhao and others have all become officials. Why don't you go to the lord and get an official position to glorify your family and secure a title for your wife and children?"</p>
<p>Jie Zitui listened and smiled, saying, "Mr. Jie, it's not like that. The lord should be the ruler of the state of Jin, which is not our merit. How can I take credit for it? I followed the prince in exile, originally wanting to do something great for the homeland, but now that cannot be accomplished. Mr. Jie, I am not like Jiu Fan, following the prince only to be promoted, become rich, and enjoy wealth and glory. Mr. Jie, let's talk about other things. There's no need to mention these things."</p>
<p>Seeing that Jie Zitui's intention was very firm, Jie Zhang did not say anything more. After talking about other things, he left.</p>
<p>After Jie Zhang left, Jie Zitui went to the back hall, saw his mother, and said, "Jie Zhang is so ridiculous, advising me to go to the lord and ask for an official position."</p>
<p>Jie's mother said, "My son, you followed the lord in exile for nineteen years and contributed a lot. It wouldn't be too much to ask for an official position!"</p>
<p>Jie Zitui said, "Mother, as your son often says, the lord should ascend the throne, and no one has contributed to that. Stealing other people's money is robbery, let alone stealing the credit of Heaven. Jiu Fan and the others claim it as their own merit, and I look down on them. How can I follow their example? Moreover, I cannot stay in a place where everyone thinks about their own promotion and wealth. Mother, you know your son's character."</p>
<p>Jie's mother said, "It's fine if you don't become an official. But what about letting everyone know that you followed the lord in exile for nineteen years?"</p>
<p>Jie Zitui said, "What's the point of that? Since I don't want to be an official, why should everyone know that there is a person like me? I think that once Jie Zhang leaves, he will definitely spread the word. The career I wanted to pursue will not succeed. Since I cannot serve the homeland, I might as well go to the deep mountains and forests and live a leisurely life. What does Mother think?" Jie's mother said, "If you can chew on vegetable roots and endure hardship, how can I not? I'll follow you."</p>
<p>After the mother and son discussed, they packed their luggage at night and set off before dawn, went to the depths of Mount Mian, built a few thatched huts, and lived in seclusion.</p>
<p>After Jie Zhang came out of Jie Zitui's house, he felt indignant. Such a meritorious person, yet without any benefits. The more he thought about it, the more unfair he felt. He rushed to the outside of Duke Wen of Jin's palace at night and wrote a few lines:</p>
<p>"The dragon wants to ascend to heaven,</p>
<p>Five snakes assist him.</p>
<p>The dragon has risen to the clouds,</p>
<p>Four snakes each enter their abode;</p>
<p>One snake alone complains,</p>
<p>Never to be found."</p>
<p>The next day, the guards of the palace copied it down and presented it to Duke Wen of Jin. Duke Wen of Jin suddenly realized, "This is Jie Zitui. I forgot for a moment and haven't rewarded him yet."</p>
<p>So he ordered people to go to Jie Zitui's house to summon him, but he was nowhere to be found. The officials inquired in many ways and finally met Jie Zhang, who told them that Jie Zitui had gone to Mount Mian to live in seclusion. However, Jie Zhang still dared not say for sure that Jie Zitui was in Mount Mian.</p>
<p>The officials returned to report, and Duke Wen of Jin ordered them to go to Mount Mian to search. The officials followed the order and searched all over Mount Mian, but they could not find Jie Zitui anywhere. They returned to report. Duke Wen of Jin had no choice but to rename Mount Mian to Mount Jie, saying, "Remember this is my mistake; it shows that Mr. Jie Zitui is a virtuous man."</p>
<h3 id="e229">Biography of David Livingstone <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>—The Greatest African Explorer—</p>
<p>David Livingstone was born in Scotland in 1813. With a square face, thick eyebrows, and big eyes, he looked very clumsy, but everyone loved him because he was not only kind but also insightful. His academic performance was outstanding, even in the most precise sciences.</p>
<p>From a young age, he had great ambitions. He liked climbing mountains and hills, living an adventurous life in the wild. His specialty was in medicine. But he was unwilling to stay in his home country, eating ordinary food and living a simple life for decades. His ambition was to go to the ends of the earth, to places where humans had never set foot in dense forests and valleys. He wanted to experience wonders and discover places that humans had never seen before. With this great ambition, he joined the London Missionary Society and was sent to Africa to do missionary work.</p>
<p>Initially, he wanted to go to China because Westerners in the early 19th century had some mysterious and strange ideas about China. But since he had been assigned to Africa, he focused all his attention on going there. As soon as he arrived in Africa, he began a life of adventure. He believed that the most important work to be done in Africa was not just missionary work, but to be a pioneer and explore the unexplored interior of Africa, bringing it to the attention of the world. As for starting businesses, it was necessary to first develop all the remote areas. He spent two years exploring from south to north, and set up a home in Mabotsa as a place to rest during his travels. He also married a wife.</p>
<p>After marriage, Livingstone continued his exploration life. His wife sometimes accompanied him, and sometimes stayed at home to organize the records he wrote down at any time, so that he could travel with peace of mind. He first explored Lake Ngami, and then crossed the Kalahari Desert, all places that Westerners had never been to before. He recorded all his findings and observations in detail and sent them to England for publication, arousing the attention of his countrymen. Then he discovered the largest river in central Africa, the Zambezi River, and went south to the Cape of Good Hope. In these few experiences, he had roughly connected the north and south of Africa. His reports were welcomed and noticed by countless people in England. Geographers changed the map of Africa based on his reports, and botanists and zoologists also added many new materials. Livingstone's books were sold everywhere, and it is impossible to count how many editions were printed. The money he earned could have allowed him to sit in London and become a wealthy man. But he did not care about enjoying such things. He used the money to build a steamboat himself, simply stopping missionary work and specializing in exploration in Africa. During his explorations, he once had his left arm eaten by a lion, was besieged by African mosquitoes, and almost lost his life; several times he developed dysentery due to poor diet, and fever and malaria were even more common. Regardless of injuries or illnesses, his ambition did not yield. As soon as he recovered, he went to dangerous places in the forest, determined to completely understand the interior of Africa before stopping!</p>
<p>He began to push directly from the coast to the interior, and with several natives reached Luanda, from where he entered Lake Dilolo, followed the Zambezi River and discovered the world-famous Victoria Falls, as well as Lake Nyasa in the center of Africa. In order to investigate the surrounding area and details of this lake, he ordered the boat to be in the lake, landed alone on foot, and recorded the details of what he saw. Finally, he broke through the mosquito siege, penetrated the Zambezi River and reached its mouth. There he greeted his wife.</p>
<p>Now, central Africa had been discovered by him, only the area between Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa remained to be investigated. This was not a very difficult thing for him, so after finding this area, he began to explore the source of the Nile River.</p>
<p>His third exploration started from Lake Nyasa. Proceeding west from here, he discovered the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, the Loange area, and Lake Bangweulu. During this trip, he encountered many slave hunters and slave traders, which made him very angry. However, he soon received comfort, because in Ujiji he met his friend Stanley. This friend accompanied him on their travels. They went through many difficulties and finally reached the northern end of Lake Tanganyika. The exploration of central Africa was finally completed, opening up a large area that was uninhabited and occupied by mosquitoes, poisonous snakes, and fierce beasts!</p>
<p>We said that although Livingstone discovered Africa and solved the geographical mysteries of Africa, he refused to be satisfied. He still wanted to explore the Nile River. His body was very weak because of lack of nutrition and rest, and because of being bitten by poisonous snakes. In this last exploration of the Nile, he contracted a very severe case of dysentery and died on the road. The people who were with him, both white and black, mourned together and cried loudly. They preserved the manuscripts and equipment he left behind, along with his remains, very carefully, and sent them back to England. His remains were buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Livingstone spent his life in exploration and investigation for thirty years, day after day. His footprints stretched from the Cape of Good Hope to the equator, from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean, almost all over half of the African continent. In history, among all the people who explored in Africa, there was no one like him who had such a long period of time and such great achievements, and no one like him who worked so hard and died in his duty. Livingstone is truly a great man.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Dead Souls <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— De Zhong</p>
<p>I. The Author's Life and Background of Dead Souls</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the nineteenth century, in Ukraine, there was born Gogol, who shook the countries of Europe and laid the foundation for Russian realism. In the entire system of Russian realism, writers have inherited Gogol's mantle in succession.</p>
<p>He was born into a noble family. His father was a nobleman who loved literature and drama, and his mother was a gentle, kind, and devout woman. Influenced by his father, he developed a great enthusiasm for literature and drama, to the point where he once wanted to devote himself to the life of an actor. Influenced by his mother, he deeply imprinted in his mind the happiness of heaven, the pain of hell, and the Last Judgment, and he became a devout religious believer. This created his tragedy in his later years.</p>
<p>After his father died, he left his hometown of Little Russia and went to Petersburg. Although he failed to become an actor and became a minor official, he felt that it did not suit his interests and resigned. However, he broadened his horizons in Petersburg and learned about Russian society at the time.</p>
<p>What was Russian society like in the nineteenth century?</p>
<p>It was a time when Western European industrial capitalism was developing, and democratic ideas were surging into European countries like a huge wave. Russia, far away in the north, was also affected by the foam of this wave. But in Russia at that time, no matter how cruel the serf system was, no matter how dark and chaotic the politics were, Emperor Nicholas was trying his best to suppress democratic ideas throughout the country. The government explicitly prohibited the country from discussing political and social issues related to the empire. On the other hand, he tried his best to protect the serf system, attempting to prolong its fate. But the fact was undeniable: the feudal aristocratic system encountered the capitalist system head-on, and it was impossible to win. Thus, the Russian feudal aristocratic system began to show signs of collapse.</p>
<p>Thus, Gogol's great work "Dead Souls" was produced.</p>
<p>II. A Brief Overview of the Story of Dead Souls</p>
<p>The story of "Dead Souls" is as follows: A poor nobleman, Chichikov, wants to make a fortune by buying the names of dead serfs. At that time, the census registration in Russia was held every ten to twenty years. But before this census, the landowners paid the government a poll tax for their serfs according to the number of names in the previous census. Even if many serfs had died in the intervening years, the government did not recognize that these names were gone. Chichikov bought these serfs who were still alive in the eyes of the law but were actually dead. This was certainly very beneficial to the landowners, because he reduced their useless burden. Therefore, Chichikov's plan went very smoothly. He bought a large number of dead serf names at a very low price; some landowners were even willing to give them to him unconditionally.</p>
<p>Chichikov, with a servant Petrushka and a coachman Selifan, stayed at an inn in the provincial capital NN. He began to visit all the officials in the city. Through the visits to the officials, he met the large landowners near NN. Then he started his work. He sat in the carriage, driven by Selifan, and ran east, west, north, and south in the countryside. He met the sentimental and bored Manilov, the stubborn and rigid old woman Korobochka, the bragging rogue Nozdryov, the cunning Sobakevich, and the stingy Plyushkin. He bought serfs said to be worth "one hundred thousand rubles" from these people, and he was immediately respected by the entire city as a "millionaire."</p>
<p>With so many dead serfs, he planned to buy many cheap wastelands in the Kherson province or the Tavrida province, and then carry out the legal procedures to move the dead serfs there. Then he would mortgage them to the state's "Relief Bureau." Each serf could be mortgaged for two hundred rubles, so he could immediately get two hundred thousand rubles.</p>
<p>Because serfs were called "souls," dead serfs were called "dead souls."</p>
<p>III. The Society Reflected in Dead Souls</p>
<p>Kropotkin said, "Gogol's main work is 'Dead Souls.' This is a novel with almost no plot, or rather, a novel with an extremely simple plot." Precisely because of this, the reader, following the protagonist of the book, travels throughout the society of the time of Nicholas I and understands the entirety of that society.</p>
<p>In addition to Chichikov's trading opponents, each of whom has a unique personality, the author's pen also sweeps across all levels of society. Gentlemen have this art: "speaking to a landowner with 'one hundred souls' is completely different from speaking to one with three hundred." They flatter the rich as much as possible. The young ladies say "elegant" things, discuss the issue of clothing every day, and pursue the rich. Serfs are working hard, standing upright when the master beats and scolds them. The royal officers are experts in drinking, gambling, dancing, and whoring, and there is no discipline in the army to be seen. State officials are a group of cowardly fellows who panic and lose their composure at the slightest thing; but they have rich experience in accepting bribes. The court is dark to the end; the meetings are wasteful and fruitless. The author depicts all of this with a profound outline.</p>
<p>When Gogol wrote this book, he had this attitude: "Why should I keep secrets? Who else besides the author has the obligation to proclaim the sacred truth? You are afraid of the penetrating gaze of deep research shining on you, you dare not use this gaze to look at the object, you like to be blind, not to think, to slip past everything." He also said, "My duty is even simpler and closer: it is to make people think, not for me alone to think first. My scope is souls, the powerful and solid things of life. Therefore, my affairs and creations should also be powerful and solid."</p>
<p>Yes, "Dead Souls" is a novel, and at the same time, it is also a history. It has records that historical pens cannot record.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Review of "Short Sword Collection" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Ren</p>
<p>The Cultural Life Society has recently published Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's "Short Sword Collection."  The majority of the collection is Mr. Zheng's recent essays on Chinese literature, divided into two volumes containing twelve works in total. It can be considered a collection of essays that continues "Collection of Essays on Chinese Literary History" and "Gou Chang Collection."</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's past efforts in Chinese literature are unforgettable. Just considering his "Outline of Literature" and "Illustrated History of Chinese Literature," they are already highly acclaimed masterpieces of recent years. Therefore, this collection of essays is equally worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In the first article, "An Inquiry into the Style of Ci Poetry," he opposes the general liberation movement of Ci poetry, concluding: "If someone wants to write new verses of varying lengths for their own singing, there are only two paths they should take: (1) composing their own music, that is, becoming a composer themselves, creating new songs. (2) adopting folk songs or Western sheet music to do real 'lyric writing'." This is a bright and splendid path for those aspiring to create new styles of songs. It shares similar reasons with Mr. Zhu Youbai's recent promotion of "Tang Poetry Revival" in "New Paths of Chinese Poetry," differing greatly from those who blindly advocate "restoration."</p>
<p>Among them, "Punctuating Ancient Books and Promoting Old Literature" and "Suggestions to Those Who Reprint Ancient Books" are two articles. One opposes the current punctuation of ancient books that is unhelpful and harmful, and the other suggests reprinting ancient paintings. They are discussed very thoroughly and clearly, and are things that people in the publishing industry should know.</p>
<p>In addition, "The Reasons and Characteristics of Yuan Dynasty Public Case Dramas" and "Jing and Chou" are Mr. Zheng's recent contributions to the study of drama, with many accurate textual researches that have not been explored before.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not a book without any debatable points. There are some ideas that I cannot agree with. For example, in "The Problem of Chinese Literary Heritage," it says: "We need to broaden our horizons and choose works beyond utilitarianism and individualism. We don't need to worship literature, nor do we need sentimental literature centered solely on personal wealth and fame. What we need are greater works with a more permanent life." After reading this, what exactly are "greater works with a more permanent life"? Mr. Zheng did not clearly indicate, only giving a few Western examples. But he said in "Where Should Researchers of Chinese Literature Go": "Literary forms such as 'bianwen,' 'zhugongdiao,' 'tanci,' and 'guzici,' which have not yet become the focus of general research, which one is not worth our attention...? We do not deny the importance and greatness of Tang poetry and Song lyrics, but praising 'bianwen' and 'zhugongdiao' does not mean belittling the status of poetry and lyrics. This is not a matter of antagonistic rivalry, but simply discovering and adding some great works to make the literary scene of Tang and Song more splendid." Perhaps the "bianwen," "zhugongdiao," "tanci," "guzici," etc. mentioned here are what Mr. Zheng refers to as greater works with a more permanent life. However, I have dabbled a little in these bianwen and zhugongdiao, etc., and they are all full of feudal consciousness, much like the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School of today. I am reluctant to acknowledge the so-called greater and more permanent life.</p>
<p>The article "Complexity and Simplicity in Literature" says: "If we want the literary world to embark on the right path and for great masterpieces to appear, we must advocate complexity... Simplicity is vulgar, it is perfunctory. If we want to write articles that are not perfunctory and vulgar, we must put effort into the word 'complexity'." The meaning here is clearly to advocate complexity, but he also said: "From the perspective of rhetoric, 'expression is sufficient,' 'regardless of complexity or simplicity.' How can one create an article without flaws? There are many conditions, and it cannot be judged by the words 'complexity' or 'simplicity'." So, the quality of writing has little to do with complexity or simplicity, which contradicts the previous advocacy of the word "complexity." Originally, I believe that the issue of complexity and simplicity in writing is that both have their place and should be determined according to the situation of each article. Sometimes "complexity" is needed, but sometimes "simplicity" is also needed. It should not be rigidly adhered to. For example, when Ban Gu wrote the biography of Sima Xiangru, it was not considered verbose even with over five hundred characters; while the two sentences "You are the wind, the common people are the grass" in the Book of Documents, although only a few words, contain extremely profound meaning and are not considered simple. These examples have been mentioned many times in previous people's notes, so advocating "complexity" or "simplicity" is a biased argument.</p>
<p>I will end my criticism here. Finally, I believe that although this collection is not without its debatable points, it is still a book worth consulting and I would like to introduce it to those engaged in Chinese literature.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Dictionary of Words and Phrases (Continued) <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>Because most of China's ancient books are voluminous, if the title of the chapter is not specified, even if the name of the book is known, the result will still be nothing. For example, for the entry "Yiqie" (everything), if it is not specified that it is from the "Biography of Li Si" in the Records of the Grand Historian, then you would have to go through all 130 chapters of the entire book, reading the entire text of more than 520,000 words. By then, you may still not be able to find it, and you will have wasted time and energy. Some say that this is because the indexes for ancient Chinese books are not yet complete. But I would say that with this book, there is no need to worry about making indexes any more.</p>
<p>According to the old entries published in the newspapers, the following are worth introducing:</p>
<p>(1) Sanshi Wu (Three Fives) - This abstract term has a total of eight different meanings. Some refer to the Three Correct Principles and Five Elements, some refer to the Three Celestial Bodies and Five Stars, some refer to the Three Kings and Five Hegemons. It can be considered very broad.</p>
<p>(2) Yuan Shu - This is a relatively obscure term. Its explanation and references are very detailed.</p>
<p>(3) Xuan Ti</p>
<p>(4) Siliu</p>
<p>(5) Aoti Tao - Many of these literary terms are only scattered in various new poetry talks or small notes, and are not found in sacred texts. It was not an easy task to find these terms.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the individual characters that it proposes.</p>
<p>The individual characters it proposes are "　" and "Tang." The sources of these two characters are the Rites of Zhou and Zheng's commentary, commentary quoting Gan's commentary, Guangya, Record of Ritual, Shuowen, and Shuowen citing examples from classics. Their meanings are: the original meaning of 　 is old, decayed wood, the extended meaning is the smell of decayed wood, profound, and the further extended meaning is disease, and 庮 and it are even the same character. Here, Kangxi Dictionary is used as an example to prove that the previous dictionary's explanation was cursory. This is indeed the progress of this book. Now I will take the trouble to copy the explanations of these two characters in Kangxi Dictionary and Dictionary of Words and Phrases below, so that readers can compare:</p>
<p>(1) 庮 - Shuowen: "Old, decayed wood." Inner Offerings of the Rites of Zhou: "If the ox lows at night, it is 庮." Note: "Zheng Sinong said: 庮 is the smell of decayed wood." (Kangxi Dictionary)</p>
<p>(1) Old, decayed wood, see Shuowen. Duan's Note: "Old wood before decay." (2) The smell of decayed wood. Inner Offerings of the Rites of Zhou: "If the ox sings at night, it is 庮." Note quotes Zheng Sinong saying: "庮 is the smell of decayed wood." Sun Yirang's interpretation: "Commentary quotes Gan's Note saying: It is disease. Guangya Explains Words says: 庮 is disease. 庮 and 庮 are interchangeable. Shuowen quotes Rites of Zhou and explains it by saying: 'It smells like decayed wood,' meaning the taste of meat has changed. Changed taste is disease, so Gan's Note interprets 庮 as disease. Also, Inner Regulations: "If the ox lows at night, it is." Note: "庮 is a bad smell." Generally speaking." (Dictionary of Words and Phrases)</p>
<p>Comparing these two books, the explanation of Kangxi Dictionary is indeed too simple. (3) 庮 - Boya: "庮 is disease." Also, Jiyun: "The smell of old, decayed wood." Inner Offerings of the Rites of Zhou: "If the ox lows at night, it is 　" Note: "庮 is the smell of decayed wood" (Kangxi Dictionary)</p>
<p>It is disease, see Guangya. Wang Niansun's explanation: "Inner Changes of the Rites of Zhou: If the ox sings at night, it is 庮. Zheng Zhong's note says: '庮 is the smell of decayed wood.' Commentary quotes Gan Bao's note saying: 庮 is disease. Interchangeable with 庮. See the note for character 庮."</p>
<p>The Boya mentioned in Kangxi Dictionary is actually Guangya, this is a mistake. The original text of the Rites of Zhou is 庮, not 庮, but this is written as 庮, this is the second mistake. Dictionary of Words and Phrases can correct these two points, which is also very good.</p>
<p>This book has not yet been published, what is mentioned here is naturally its essence; however, by extrapolation, this book should still be good. I am specifically introducing it here, hoping that China Publishing House will not disappoint our hopes, delay publication, or be inconsistent with its reputation. Really, in this era of advancing learning and art, moving personnel, metabolism, and rapid changes, the proliferation and evolution of language is galloping forward and progressing rapidly, we truly need an ideal dictionary in our literary world to relieve our hunger.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Those Suffering from Gonorrhea Face This Danger! How Can One Be Careless When Taking Medicine?! Poisoning from Inferior Medicine and Rescue - Discussing Gonorrhea and Vaccine Therapy <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>So-called gonorrhea vaccine therapy involves cultivating the pathogenic bacteria in test tubes, killing them, and injecting them under the skin, with the aim of generating immunity to the gonococci, but there is no absolute immunity. There are two types: one is to make a vaccine from the patient's own gonococci, called autogenous vaccine, and the other is called heterogenous vaccine, which is made from other people's gonococci. Among them, autogenous vaccine injection has a greater effect, but it can only be used for acute gonorrhea in its early stages, and the effect is uncertain. Many gonorrhea patients must have undergone vaccine injection and know that it is an outdated therapy.</p>
<p>However, today there are many unscrupulous people who only know how to seek profit. Seeing that "Krelnon," the anti-gonococcus agent invented by Peter of Germany, has a definite curative effect for all stages of gonorrhea, they have far-fetched ideas and recklessly use other people's gonococci to make oral vaccine drugs to deceive patients, claiming to have some effect. Just think, gonorrhea is transmitted by gonococci, so how can other people's gonococci be used as oral medicine, isn't that suicide? However, due to the cruel merchants using newspapers to promote it, there are many victims. Mr. Wu, who lives on Great Western Road, also suffered from gonorrhea. He had used vaccine injections externally for many injections without effect. Later, he was misled by advertisements and mistakenly purchased an oral medicine made of vaccine preparations. Before long, he felt dizzy and nauseous, and the pus in the urethra suddenly stopped. The testicles, seminal vesicles, spermatic cords, etc. were all occupied by gonococci. The mucous membrane was densely covered with gonococci, which was obviously a sign that the inferior medicine had introduced the poison internally. The heart also had symptoms of poisoning. Therefore, when Mr. Wu came to me for treatment, he was mentally unclear. In addition to performing emergency surgery, I immediately administered the special medicine "Krelnon" to reduce inflammation, resist gonorrhea, and kill bacteria. After more than a month of treatment, he turned the corner and was completely cured. Mr. Wu regretted his recklessness and should not have mistakenly taken the gonococcus preparation.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Lower Back Pain and Vaginal Discharge Are Causes of Infertility <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Jin Yueren</p>
<p>If a woman has lower back pain and vaginal discharge, her body must be deficient. This condition is often caused by inflammation in the uterus or urethra, resulting in the discharge of foul fluid, which is yellowish-white in color or mixed with blood. If not remedied urgently, the reproductive organs near the uterus will be affected, menstrual irregularities, abdominal distension. Infertility among women who have been married for a long time is also commonly seen in women with vaginal discharge. The method of curing it must take care of both sides.</p>
<p>Regarding the symptomatic treatment of this disease, "Cardiol Shettie's Vaginal Tablets" must be used as a suppository to eliminate vaginal discharge and prevent local decay. "Bu Nv Rong" is also used as an oral medicine to regulate menstruation and invigorate blood. It will be effectively cured in a few weeks. However, those who suffer from vaginal discharge due to gonorrhea infection can also take "Krelnon" to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria, then its effect is even greater. The method of use is to take one "Vaginal Tablet" and insert it deep into the vagina before going to bed every night. Wash it off the next morning.</p>

<p>Gospel in the Midst of Gonorrhea's Rampancy</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of gonorrhea is even greater than that of syphilis. In many large cities, about 80% of men suffer from gonorrhea. Therefore, the treatment of gonorrhea is also changing with each passing day. However, many stubborn doctors still adhere to outdated methods, such as vaccine therapy. Doctors who are slightly more modern now regard it as an outdated therapy because its effect is uncertain and its side effects are very large.</p>
<p>In general, vaccine injections were often used for gonorrhea during the acute phase, but because it could not be completely cured, it turned into a chronic condition. Therefore, the scope of gonorrhea's spread has increased. Therefore, it is mostly discarded and everyone has switched to oral medicine "Krelnon." The characteristics of "Krelnon" are threefold: First, after taking "Krelnon," its bactericidal effect directly occurs at the lesion site without damaging healthy tissue. Second, taking "Krelnon" can invigorate the overall bacterial anti-gonorrhea immune function, and both systemic infections and local gonococci can be captured in one fell swoop, and can achieve the subtle effect of "eliminating gonorrhea completely." Third, many bactericidal drugs have very large side effects and often cause nausea after taking them, while "Krelnon" has absolutely no such adverse phenomena. "Krelnon" has these three strengths, and it should be popular all over the world and be used by famous doctors. It is truly a blessing for gonorrhea's rampancy among humans. As for women with gonorrheal vaginal discharge, in addition to taking "Krelnon" internally, "Cardiol Shettie's Vaginal Tablets" should also be used as a suppository to cleanse the local vaginal discharge. Then, taking care of both internally and externally will complement each other and the effect will be faster.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Underdevelopment <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>One Mistake After Another - One Mistake Masturbation, Another Mistake Taking Aphrodisiacs</p>
<p>So-called underdevelopment refers to a short body, a sallow complexion, and the lower penis is as small as a child's, mostly due to the patient's masturbation in his youth, which has lost his endocrine function. Organ therapy should be performed to invigorate endocrine function to promote the development of the gonads.</p>
<p>However, patients often covet immediate benefits, which increases the disease. There is Mr. Liang who lives on Jing'an Temple Road. He had been fond of masturbation since he was a teenager, resulting in the unhealthy development of his body and reproductive organs, and he also had symptoms such as seminal emission and incomplete penile erection. Later, he saw newspaper advertisements for pills with reproductive-related terms, and bought and took them, but after taking them, he only felt invigorated for a short time and then wilted. It was actually an aphrodisiac. Mr. Liang did not realize this, and coveting temporary success, he continued to take it. After taking it for less than half a month, even though he took a large amount of this type of inferior medicine, it still had no effect, and he felt even more mentally tired, his body became thinner, and he had symptoms such as heavy head and insomnia, like tuberculosis. Only then did he urgently seek treatment at my place. Upon examination, this disease was entirely caused by masturbation and taking aphrodisiacs. I then prescribed the German hormone preparation "Body-Plus" to him. After taking about seven or eight bottles, the endocrine system had been invigorated, and the reproductive system tissues were strengthened, and development gradually moved towards a healthy state. He was completely cured. As for women's underdevelopment, late menstruation, and long-term infertility, "Bu Nv Rong" is used. Because "Body-Plus" and "Bu Nv Rong" are both made from the hormones of brave and healthy animals, their efficacy is magnificent.</p>

<p>Colds are the Source of All Respiratory Diseases The Danger of Untreated Bronchitis</p>
<p>Whether the phlegm is thick or thin, white, or the cough is acute or mild, it is a disease of bronchitis. When inflammation causes bronchial spasm, the lesser case is children's whooping cough, and the greater case is elderly asthma (also cardiac asthma). If we trace the source of persistent cough and stubborn phlegm in bronchitis, it is mostly caused by delayed colds.</p>
<p>"Colds that don't wake up turn into consumption." Bronchitis and asthma often lead to death due to respiratory paralysis. "Pulmo-Calcium," a calcium preparation, contains a purified collodion main component called Kecol, which has a remarkable effect on catarrhal respiratory diseases beyond its preservative power. Its phlegm elimination is thorough, and its cough suppression and asthma relief are definitely clear, which is not comparable to ordinary preparations!</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Simple Pigment Preparations Have No Ability to Completely Cure Turbidity Must Be Used in Conjunction with Leukocyte Therapy to Increase Phagocytic Action</p>
<p>Among the various therapies for gonorrhea, the most useless is the transparent membrane sterilization vaccine therapy. Its medicinal properties are extremely short-lived. After a certain period of time, the original gonorrhea will recur, and it will cause various complications. The severe cases are fatal, and the mild cases are disabled. According to my experience, vaccine injections are better than oral administration, but vaccine injections are difficult to be completely effective, so oral vaccine is even more difficult to succeed. Therefore, the vaccine mixed preparations sold in the market are just merchants' exaggerated propaganda. If patients have no medical knowledge, how can they not be deceived by them, and use their lives as sacrifices in vain? This is why we formal doctors must be saddened when we witness this.</p>
<p>In short, the only way to treat gonorrhea is to use purified pigments, because the quality of pigments is mixed and the purification is impure, there is a risk of damaging the stomach and endangering life, but once refined, the original powerful medicinal effect must be supplemented with protein to be fully effective, and to achieve a great and reliable effect of eliminating gonorrhea and antibacterial.</p>
<p>The pigment extraction procedure is most reliable only by Dr. Peter's method in Germany, because his equipment was invented by himself, and his purified pigment combines with protein to increase human leukocytes, and arouse the body's anti-toxic and eliminate gonorrhea and sterilization effect. Whether it is local or systemic lesions, it can be fundamentally eliminated. This medicine is the "Krelnon" which is popular in various countries in recent times. It is a special medicine for all acute and chronic turbidity and complications and urethral infectious diseases in men and women. Its power is sufficient and its nature is kingly, and it is truly the authority of gonorrhea medicine.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is the Greatest Enemy of Mankind, Especially Young People Calcium Can Fill the Lesion Holes Due to the Advocacy of Dr. Zuoda, General Practitioners Use It</p>
<p>Calcium, also called calcium in chemistry, has the power to strengthen the body and provide assistance to lung tissue. The cavities of lung lesions are filled with calcium, so that tubercle bacilli lose their base and will soon be eliminated. But it takes more than a year for them to die, so even after being cured by taking calcium, you still cannot completely forget the recuperation. Because tubercle bacilli have the strongest endowment, it is not easy to kill them. The infected people are mostly young people. After being infected, the muscles gradually disappear, so-called physical existence and qi death, but they are living dead. Therefore, anyone who has suspected lung disease should quickly take calcium preparations "Pulmo-Calcium" to prevent and treat it. First case of lung disease: Chen Zhengkang, 23 years old, academic.</p>
<p>Symptoms: The patient has been coughing for two years, especially at night, with a lot of phlegm, which settles to the bottom of the container in the shape of a coin. Tidal fever, hemoptysis, palpitations, and insomnia. Loss of appetite and weight loss.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Diagnosed as stage II tuberculosis. Adrenal cortical essence injection was given, but no effect was seen. I prescribed "Pulmo-Calcium" to supplement calcium, eliminate lung cough, stop bleeding and eliminate phlegm. At the same time, I told him to take "Body-Plus" to increase his physical strength and improve his nutrition (women use "Bu Nv Rong" to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body), and to treat insomnia and weakness (take "Essence-Nourishing Tablets" for seminal emission), and it will have a satisfactory and complete cure effect! The patient felt comfortable, and his weight increased greatly after five months!</p>

<p>Seminal Emission Comes from Abnormal Sexual Life Minor Erotic Stimulation Causes Excessive Impulses This Leads to the Bad Consequence of Neurasthenia!</p>
<p>Sexual life is an animal instinct and should not be regarded as mysterious.

If you accidentally see beauty, you will have an extreme impulse and can't help but leak sperm. Eventually leading to neurasthenia and shortening life.</p>
<p>To get rid of this kind of pain, you should suppress the excitement, consolidate the sperm gate, and you can buy "Essence-Nourishing Tablets" from Wing On Chinese and Western to treat it. At the same time, try to save sexual neurasthenia and insomnia, forgetfulness, and dizziness, so take "Body-Plus" first. Do not take other aphrodisiacs such as gonadal preparations, drink to quench thirst!</p>

<p>Recently, there have been unscrupulous individuals on the market, blinded by greed, using gonorrhea bacteria to create an oral medication, falsely promoting it as "Vaxin Oral Medicine," harming patients. When advertising in newspapers, they often borrow the language of "Klinon," leading patients to believe the evidence is similar to "Klinon," and thus purchase and take it, resulting in an increasing number of victims who then suspect "Klinon" is a substandard drug. Investigations reveal that this "Vaxin Oral Medicine" produced by these unscrupulous individuals has only been on the market for a month or two, while the "Klinon" manager in China has been in place for years. The facts are all there and can be verified. In the future, patients purchasing medication should identify the words "Klinon." If your condition worsens or life-threatening situations arise due to taking "Vaxin Oral Medicine," it has nothing to do with "Klinon." This warning is issued in advance, hoping for your attention!</p>

<p>With the weather suddenly turning cold and hot, diseases are prone to occur. According to statistics from various epidemic hospitals in this city, in recent days, the majority of patients are suffering from gastroenteritis. This is due to residents' carelessness with diet and sleep, excessive indulgence in coolness, or unrestrained consumption of raw and cold foods, or even accidental consumption of food containing bacteria, leading to bacterial reproduction in the stomach and intestines. Consequently, the contents of the stomach and intestines ferment, causing inflammation, resulting in diarrhea, abdominal pain, a heavy head, headache, fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, and other ailments. It is heard that a "Wei Bao" (Stomach Treasure) has recently appeared on the market, having passed inspection by the Central Health Department and issued Certificate No. 366. It has the effect of clearing away decaying substances in the stomach and intestines, eliminating intestinal fermentation, and effectively treating and preventing these conditions in a short period of time, thus avoiding the danger of other summer diseases (such as red and white dysentery and chronic gastroenteritis). Furthermore, "Wei Bao" is a mild and virtuous medicine, unmatched by other stomach and intestinal preparations. It is sold in major pharmacies and Western medicine departments of major companies in this city and is the most standard new stomach medicine of modern times. (The End)</p>

<p>Gonococci are most likely to reach the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, and then from the posterior urethra to the bladder, causing cystitis. It usually occurs around the third or fourth week after infection.</p>
<p>During gonococcal cystitis, posterior urethritis also exists simultaneously. Therefore, the symptoms at this time are those of both posterior urethritis and cystitis, generally including frequent urination, pain during urination, cloudy urine, fever, loss of appetite, general discomfort, etc. In cases of pure acute cystitis, patients need to urinate at least once every two hours, day and night. In severe cases, the urination interval is even shorter, almost requiring constant urination. The pain in the bladder is also severe, especially during and at the end of urination. The pain is usually in the lower abdomen and perineum. If posterior urethritis and cystitis coexist, the entire urethra feels painful and may sometimes radiate to the anus. In addition, there may be dribbling urine and blood discharge after urination. Recently, a medicine called "Miesha Lin" (Gonorrhea Killer) has been invented for this type of cystitis. It has passed inspection by the Central Health Department and issued Pharmaceutical Certificate No. 301, and has a very good therapeutic effect. The effective ingredients of "Miesha Lin" can directly reach the bladder, urethra, and other parts, achieving the effects of killing bacteria, relieving pain, and reducing inflammation. After taking about two or three bottles, there is a gradual ability to heal. However, improper medication or treatment can lead to the danger of chronic cystitis. At that time, the degree of danger is difficult to predict, and severe cases may even lead to death.</p>

<p>Seven or eight out of ten women suffer from freckles on their faces. What is the reason for this? Although some say it is due to physiological reasons, many famous physiologists have not reported a precise answer. Thus, it is conceivable that it is not necessarily a physiological issue. According to recent research in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, freckles occur because the sebaceous glands in the hair follicle area have keratinization proliferation, obstructing the flow of sebum. The greatest cause of this is the application of cosmetics containing lead. Because lead applied to the local area can cause keratinization proliferation, hinder the flow of sebum, and constrict capillaries, etc. According to a report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on June 3, the Ministry of Health tested the cosmetics used by women across the country and found that most contained fragrant powders, which are very harmful. Even globally popular French and Belgian fragrant powders contain 25.95% lead! Thus, it can be seen that women who usually apply cosmetics to beautify their faces are actually unknowingly planting freckles. It is heard that a product called "Meili" (Beauty) has recently been invented. It is a pure freckle treatment medication, combined with high-quality powder, specifically for treating freckles, melasma, acne, and other conditions. It has a very good effect. Daily application can reorganize skin metabolism, transforming rough, dark skin into fair and tender skin. Moreover, after applying "Meili," it is not necessary to apply cosmetics again, as it is already fair and tender, as if cosmetics have been applied. It is both economical and avoids other harms, truly a beauty product in the evolution of the times. It is sold in major pharmacies and Western medicine departments of major companies in this city.</p>

<p>Since the flourishing of chemistry, it is known that our bodies are also a combination of various chemical substances. If the chemical components in the body are lacking, then some organs will lose their resistance and vitality, leading to weakness and disease. Therefore, the way to nourish the body and treat diseases is to first supplement the chemical substances lacking in the body. According to recent reports from physiologists, phosphorus is the most important of all chemical components in the human body. All important organs use it as a building material. The strength of muscles and strength in the human body depends on the amount of phosphorus in the body, and it implicitly possesses the power to control life. Therefore, everyone who discusses metabolism, nourishment, and nutrition knows the importance of phosphorus. However, how to introduce phosphorus into the human body and make it function properly to achieve nutritional and therapeutic effects has been studied jointly by famous German chemical and pharmaceutical scientists, spending countless efforts. They discovered a best-phosphorus compound pharmaceutical from special aromatic phosphorus compounds, which is the most perfect medicine for supplementing the human nervous system and various tissues. It is named "Arolsen." It has been proven by the world's pharmaceutical community to be the most perfect medicine for nourishing the body and treating diseases. It has a unique effect on neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and poor memory. It has passed inspection by the Chinese government's Health Department and issued Pharmaceutical Certificate No. 367. It is truly a specialized medicine for replenishing and treating nerves in the evolution of the times.</p>

<p>Athlete's foot is the most common disease in summer, especially at the turn of spring and summer. Due to the saturation of water vapor in the outside world and the relatively high temperature, it is easy to sweat, which is suitable for the growth of tinea fungus. The symptoms of athlete's foot include subjective itching or slight pain. Other objective symptoms seen clinically are mostly small blisters and other symptoms appearing simultaneously. There are also cases where blisters appear first, followed by other symptoms. The patient's hands and feet are prone to sweating. Blisters often grow on the sides of the second, third, and fourth toes, or on the toe webs, or on the soles of the feet. The diameter of the blisters is about three or four millimeters, slightly protruding from the skin. It can be detected by touching with the hand. The contents of the blisters contain white or slightly yellow substances. Recently, there is a skin disease medicine called "Cheng Jue Jun" (Sincere Germ Killer) on the market, which has a unique effect on killing trichophyton. Therefore, for those suffering from athlete's foot, first wash the affected area with boiling water, wipe it dry, and then apply "Miejue Jun" (Extermination Germ) for four or five days to cure it completely. It is the most perfect skin warm air medicine.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Reducing Interest Rates <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Recently, there was a piece of economic news in this city about "reducing interest rates." The impact of the news does not seem very large, and not many people paid attention to it. However, because it involves a wide range of issues, especially the connection between deposits and loans, it is worth noting. The matter began with an order from the Ministry of Finance to the banking and money industries in this city: in order to maintain industry and commerce, the interest rates on loans to industry and commerce should be reduced to provide relief. This focuses on relieving industry and commerce and advocates reducing loan interest rates. However, this order is very hesitant for the banking and money industries. In the end, they replied to the Ministry of Finance, believing that: "Our country is an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for more than 80%. All kinds of commodities rely on farmers to purchase them. Industry and commerce only extract profits from them. Therefore, the rise and fall of the rural economy is of great importance to the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce." Regarding this, they also believe that "developing industry and commerce to cultivate the countryside" is a "primary" issue. However, "reducing loan interest rates to relieve industry and commerce is not a fundamental solution." Their reason is that "to reduce loan interest rates, deposit interest rates must first be reduced. Otherwise, the financial industry will inevitably have no business to operate." Therefore, this issue of reducing interest rates has become a noteworthy issue in the current financial industry.</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of industry and commerce in China is, of course, due to many reasons. Insufficient capital, which makes it easy for large enterprises to swallow up small ones, is certainly also a "primary" reason. As for the relief of this "primary" reason, reducing the loan interest rates of banks or money shops so that small industries and businesses can circulate their capital is, of course, also a "primary" remedy. However, this remedy, as the banking and money industries stated in their reply, "is not a fundamental solution" and is insufficient. Regarding the "fundamental solution," although the banking and money industries did not explicitly point it out, if we understand that the most "primary" and recent reason for the underdevelopment of Chinese industry and commerce is the occupation of the market by smuggled goods from a certain imperialism, and the squeeze of small industries and businesses by large enterprises manipulated by a buying class that relies on the power of imperialism, then we will clearly know where the "fundamental solution" lies. At the same time, we are very happy that people from all walks of life in Shanghai are already implementing this "fundamental solution." Isn't the broad anti-smuggling movement one of the more practical methods among many?</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the banking and money industries' proposal to reduce deposit interest rates, we also believe that it is not entirely appropriate. The clear-sighted people in the banking and money industries have already understood this very well. According to them, "As for the result of reducing deposit interest rates, the people's cash may be absorbed by foreign banks, and there may be a risk of domestic funds escaping." This is a very honest statement. It is very common for large enterprises to swallow up small enterprises, especially in a society like the present. Moreover, we are still in a country in a semi-colonial position, and countless glaring jackals, especially our "friendly neighbors" who have always advocated "economic cooperation," are constantly watching for our occasional negligence. They will open their huge blood mouths and grin their wolf teeth in sly smiles.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no follow-up to this issue of reducing interest rates, but we believe that after this discussion of reducing interest rates and the various aspects involved, it will probably give everyone a new impression. From this, we are even more convinced that in a semi-colonial country, there is nothing, not even the most trivial thing, that is not related to the current imperialist aggression. At the same time, it also proves that there is no way out other than striving for true independence and liberation.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Our Country's Beekeeping and Rabbit Breeding Industries (Part 2) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>(Special Article for This Newspaper) In our country, rabbits have always been regarded as domestic animals with little potential. In the countryside, apart from a few families raising one or two as pets, no one would think of promoting them. However, recently, they have attracted the attention of general livestock breeders. For example, Mr. Gan Chunquan and Mr. Feng Huanwen can be said to be the strongest promoters of the rabbit breeding industry. Mr. Gan even went to Japan specifically to investigate and study rabbit breeding. Currently, Mr. Gan and Mr. Feng are preparing to build a rabbit hair weaving factory.</p>
<p>Rabbits are divided into five types: wool-producing, fur-producing, meat-producing, fur-meat-producing, and ornamental/meat-supplying. The sources of these breeds are England, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands. As for our country's grass rabbits and wild rabbits, they are not suitable for breeding.</p>
<p>Wool-producing rabbits include Angora, whose wool is about three inches or longer and can be spun into yarn and woven into various high-quality woolen products. Shorter wool can be used to make valuable felt hats. There are many types of fur-producing rabbits. The more valuable ones include Rex, which comes in white, steel gray, black, and gray. Because its fur is short and dense, it has great insulation and does not shed easily. Other valuable ones include fox rabbits and mink rabbits. Meat-producing rabbits include the large Flemish and improved meat breeds, which are crossbreds of two Western breeds. Their fur is also white and useful.</p>
<p>The heaviest rabbits in our country weigh only three or four pounds, while these types of rabbits weigh seven or eight pounds, or even ten pounds.</p>
<p>Besides rabbit hair being used to manufacture various high-quality woolen products, valuable rabbit fur can be used to make women's coats or collars. The fur of Chinese wild rabbits or ordinary white rabbits is not very large and sheds easily, with each pelt worth only thirty or forty cents. Rex pelts, on the other hand, are large and of high quality, worth four or five yuan each in Japan.</p>
<p>Rabbit meat is used in Japan and Italy to make canned food for the military or processed into meat floss. Because rabbit meat is delicious and nutritious, the analysis of the components of rabbit meat is as follows:</p>
<p>Protein 19.7-91%</p>
<p>Fat 8.5-16%</p>
<p>Water 62-70%</p>
<p>Minerals 1%</p>
<p>Each rabbit consumes about one to one and a half yuan of feed per year. As for its production, wool-producing rabbits produce about half a pound of wool per year, worth five yuan at ten yuan per pound. Rex pelts are worth two to five yuan each after tanning. Meat rabbits weigh five to ten pounds each, with each pound priced at about twenty cents. If processed into meat floss, the profit is doubled.</p>
<p>Normally, rabbits breed once a month. For their health, it should be limited. Breeding three times a year is most appropriate, and spring, summer, and winter are suitable seasons for rabbit production. As for management, one person can manage 150 to 250 wool-producing rabbits or 200 to 400 fur-meat-producing rabbits.</p>
<p>As for feed, the ratio is five parts barley, two parts bean cake, one part bran, and a small amount of salt. In winter, tofu dregs and bran can be fed once every morning.</p>
<p>Green foods include alfalfa, sweet clover, purple cloud english (all three are suitable fresh or dried), cabbage, rabbit ear grass, goat's milk grass (plentiful near Shanghai), yellow carrots, potatoes, green wheat, and green grass. These green foods should be fed twice a day, half a pound each time, mixed with a handful of compound feed.</p>
<p>Regarding disease prevention, first, attention must be paid to keeping the rabbitry dry, with good air circulation and cleanliness. It needs to be warm in winter and cool in summer. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e253">Quick Sketch <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>While organizing my bookshelves, I accidentally found a quick sketch of me in an old diary. When I say it's a quick sketch of me, only the person who drew it and I, the one who was drawn, can understand it. That quick sketch simply depicts the outline of a face, without facial features, with a pair of large glasses, which is considered my symbol. However, the person who drew it is worth commemorating. That quick sketch has been hidden in the diary for a long time, and now that I find it, I immediately recall the person who drew it and that night.</p>
<p>Now I should explain a little more clearly. The person who drew it is my cousin, my mother's niece. My mother died very early, and my father remarried another mother before the first anniversary. My cousin, even before she learned to walk, was already calling my uncle's second wife "Mom." Although my father and uncle were both loving fathers, children need maternal love even more. As the saying goes, "A layer of belly skin is like a heavy mountain." The maternal love we needed could not be compensated for. Due to this relationship, we became close. However, closeness was only closeness. From the time she was in her teens until the year she got married, we didn't even think for a second that we were in love.</p>
<p>That summer, she came to my house and stayed for more than a month. On the night before she was to return home, we were returning from cooling off in the bamboo forest when she suddenly said with concern that we wouldn't have days like this anymore. Since we had become close, there had never been any difficult problems that could make us unhappy. We comforted each other, we sought happiness with each other, and our parents did not forbid us. The sudden news came out after she had stayed for more than a month. It was truly too strange.</p>
<p>The weather was getting cooler, and early autumn insects were chirping in the flower walls outside the window. For a long time, I didn't think I should ask her the reason. She leaned on the desk by the window, randomly scribbling on the paper with a pencil, and finally wrote four large characters, "I'm getting married."</p>
<p>Knowing that she was getting married didn't surprise me at all. That was where girls had an advantage over boys. She could get the love she expected, like maternal love, from her husband. I wanted to say what was in my heart to bless her, but strangely enough, that night I lacked that kind of courage. We were all silent. Looking back now, we might have been in love that night.</p>
<p>When she was leaving, she drew that quick sketch on paper. I kept it as a souvenir in my diary, and now the paper has turned grayish-yellow.</p>
<p>My child just flipped through some picture books next to me. It was the drawing in my hand. He snatched it and looked at the large glasses again and again, then at the glasses on my face. He cleverly said, "Daddy."</p>
<p>"Like Mommy?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Both have glasses." That was his reason.</p>
<p>I smiled and carefully hid that quick sketch back in the diary, thinking that now one more person knows that this sketch is "me."</p>
<h3 id="e254">In Qingdao <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Jifeng</p>
<p>With a happy heart, I took the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao. Qingdao is a beautiful place, even more so in the summer. How delightful it would be to play there! I had long hoped to see her, nestled in the embrace of the sea, like meeting a lover. I carried my luggage – a bundle weighing less than two pounds – my heart full of mysterious emotions, leaning on the railing, greedily gazing at the sea. Little Qingdao sat in the sea like a picture; the seawater was a restless, playful child, jumping, turning into waves, rushing onto the beach: laughing. The evening glow painted the vast sky, people still lingering in the embrace of the seabed. The benches beside the railing were already full of people enjoying the cool air; I stared, bewildered, my eyes wide.</p>
<p>-- What should I do?</p>
<p>I touched my bundle, with little more than a dollar inside. I thought of my parents at home -- they didn't want me to</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>start a business, just as they thought I was only going to Qingdao for a visit and then returning. I was lost in thought. As the net of twilight spread out, I wandered away from the seashore, seeking the little church not far from there.</p>
<p>I stayed there. The pastor was a friend of my father's, and he knew me and had liked me very much when I was little. With an uneasy heart, I wrote a letter to a friend, asking him for money, for the fare to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The afternoon the letter was sent, I found a letter from my father to the pastor on his desk: I panicked -- my family had already asked him to keep an eye on me! The letter was written in Greek, which I couldn't read. I immediately wrote another letter to the friend who was sending the money -- to send the money to the Jiaoji Daily News, to Mr. ××× to forward to me, as I was already being watched here.</p>
<p>As expected, at dinner, the pastor said to me:</p>
<p>"When do you plan to go back? There's nothing to do here!"</p>
<p>"Four or five days, maybe!"</p>
<p>He listened to my words, pretending to be very natural. I laughed inwardly -- I know what you're up to.</p>
<p>"Business isn't good this year. It's not easy to find a job on the railway here. I think you should go back early. If there's anything, I'll write to you and ask you to come, so your family won't worry about you! Didn't you want to find a job on the railway?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. He understood in his heart, and I understood in my heart. As soon as we met, he started talking about these things, which made my head hurt. I didn't want to see him, so I always slipped out into the street to pass the time.</p>
<p>The next day, I ran to Yunnan Road to find a friend, planning to move away from there. But I couldn't remember my friend's address clearly. I looked for similar numbers on Yunnan Road, but couldn't find it. As the whip of disappointment struck my heart, clinging to a thought, I came up with a way -- to check the household registration book at the Public Security Bureau. I thought no one had ever used this method. At the last branch station, I found it. Relieved in my disappointed heart, I happily went to find him -- but he had already gone to Beiping two or three days ago. An indescribable sadness weighed on my heart, and I walked back along the long Yunnan Road, listless.</p>
<p>Walking along the smooth asphalt road, passing by the foreign-style hotels and shops, I felt like a person who had lost their soul. Nothing aroused my attention, it seemed as if nothing was happening -- people wearing strange clothes, clown hats, advertising Japanese eye drops, bedbug powder, and stomach tonics, blowing and banging loudly, walking past me, and I wouldn't even glance at them unless they handed me a leaflet.</p>
<p>Dusk is the time for lovers: couples walking along the beach like shuttles. Happy faces, joyful voices, made me feel lonely -- this is not a place for me to live. Walking and looking at my shadow illuminated by the streetlights, listening to the noise of the sea, I felt too sad. I stopped, looking at the big advertisement for 'Chesterfield' cigarettes -- it depicted a beautiful woman, smiling, looking at people: I smiled, forgetting everything weighing on my heart. I lingered for a long time, frequently turning my head to look back as I left, not even watching the road.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, I received a letter from that friend from the newspaper office, and I was happy, like a bird that had grown its wings and was about to fly out of the nest. He sent me fifteen dollars.</p>
<p>"How do I get away from here?"</p>
<p>I had already inquired about the ship's departure date -- there was a ship that day, and I bought the ticket.</p>
<p>When I went to the pastor's, he was taking a nap. I was overjoyed, and I left the letter I had written long ago on the table, wrapped his blanket in my small bundle, and quietly slipped out.</p>
<p>Sitting in the rickshaw, I kept looking back -- would he come after me! My heart was tightening. It was only when I stepped onto the deck of the 'Qingdao Maru' that I breathed a sigh of relief. Looking at the sea in 'Dagang' and the sky stretching above, I said softly:</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Qingdao!"</p>

<p>Mid-Autumn Moon</p>
<p>Yes, the "Mid-Autumn Moon" is extraordinarily bright. Wealthy families on this extraordinarily bright Mid-Autumn Moon night are drinking, reveling, admiring the moon, dancing, singing, and chewing on seasonal mooncakes, leisurely listening to the "Anecdotes of Emperor Tang Ming". …But this is only a holiday for the wealthy to enjoy!</p>
<p>But what about us poor people? The light of this extraordinarily bright moon cannot shine into our dovecote-like shacks or low houses. In the shacks and low houses there are: gaunt faces eroded by hunger, crying children with empty stomachs, groaning patients in bed, the fierce eyes of debt collectors at the door, chasing people to their deaths!</p>
<p>The Yue Zilin family was chased to the path of destruction -- during the extraordinarily bright "Mid-Autumn Moon."</p>
<p>Yue Zilin used to have assets of over a hundred thousand, but after repeated attacks, he finally couldn't maintain his wealth and went bankrupt and fell into poverty.</p>
<p>However, the lifestyle habits of having a wealth of over a hundred thousand made it impossible for him to change his stubbornness in his current state of decline. He insisted on saving face, and he didn't want his second daughter -- A Rong (that is, his younger sister) to be a maid for others, but the food for a family of six weighed heavily on the eldest daughter -- the older sister, and it was impossible to support them by working.</p>
<p>A Rong is an innocent little girl, but because of her beauty, she was deceived by the young master, Hu Xinmei. But she is young, her will is extremely weak, she doesn't know that this is a deception!</p>
<p>Just as "he is tired of playing with those young ladies: now he wants to make fun of us poor people!"</p>
<p>"You are still young, you won't understand, but you should know that even if they really like you, they will forget you in a few days..." Her sister is right. Her sister is a new woman, she is carrying out the women's mass liberation movement, negotiating with the masters to improve the treatment. Therefore, their factory is on strike.</p>
<p>But for the sake of their family's life, and her younger sister was deceived and abandoned, their mother suffered heavy blows, first poisoning the three or four younger sisters, and then committing suicide herself.</p>
<p>The younger sister ran out madly. What about the older sister? She is leading the masses to resist those cruel masters!</p>
<p>The father couldn't catch up with either of them, and returned disappointed.</p>
<p>"Why are you living alone?"</p>
<p>Alas! They are all dead.</p>
<p>In short, such stories are happening layer by layer in the city, but those children are innocent. It's too cruel!</p>
<p>Save the children!</p>

<p>Opening "Briefly About Prodigy"</p>
<p>Gusts of west wind stab over. An old fisherman is seen at the boundary of a small bridge. He provides three meals a day regularly. I, the little student, devote myself to studying diligently. Suddenly, I hear three knocks on the firewood gate. I see torches and lanterns densely packed. The servants and maids have all scattered. Only the courtesan is left alone. Could it be that classmates and friends have come to joke around? Could it be that I've encountered a demon in the mountains? Miss, listen, call out to your husband. I am not a nameless woman. My father is Ma Rong, a court official. He planned to offer me to Liang Ji as a concubine in the Western Palace in order to gain wealth and honor. I am unwilling to follow the treacherous thief. Therefore, I wish to write a poem on the wall. It was cleverly seen by my father. He was furious. On the upper couplet it says: Having a name naturally brings wealth and honor. The lower couplet says: Wealth and honor will one day turn into poverty. He sent the chief steward to arrest me. He was instructed to offer me to the Prime Minister. Student Jian listens, face flushed. He thinks, why does Miss need to go to a bitter prison? He thinks of the high halls and houses in which Miss lives at home. How difficult it is to have crumbling walls and leaking roofs. Miss is served by maids and servants at home. How difficult it is to have only a lonely lamp in the room. Miss eats delicacies from the mountains and the sea at home. How difficult it is to have an empty stomach for three meals a day. Miss wears silk and satin at home. How difficult it is to have bare shoulders and chest. I advise you to return home early, Miss, to avoid suffering here. The Miss listens, tears flowing. I would rather die than be violated. So that others don't speak ill of me. As they were struggling, the old fisherman arrived, delivering charcoal in the snow. He acted as matchmaker, bringing about a beautiful encounter.</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) Midnight 0:45 to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>A new opening about wealth, poverty (Mini Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>We are all born after ten months of pregnancy. Heaven is inherently fair. Who knew that social conditions would change and wealth and poverty would be divided into heavy and light. The rich have unlimited wealth that is difficult to calculate, with gold, silver, and jewels filling the boxes. Countless tall halls and large houses, beckoning maids and calling for prostitutes to cook food. Buying fertile fields to collect rent, ignoring the bankruptcy of the countryside and the need for soldiers. The powerful bully people with their authority, with no justice at all and disregarding their names. They don't think that snow pillars and ice mountains are hard to last long, and their family assets will be sacrificed in the future. The most bitter are the common people who are in poverty, appealing with no one to hear. They try their best to maintain it until their minds are exhausted, pitifully having land that they cannot cultivate. Some have failures that suddenly lead to short-sightedness, hanging themselves or jumping into the water. I think that Confucius of Mount Ni was unmatched. He said that equality means no poverty, which is very clear. It's a pity that no one follows this, resulting in the division of classes into honor and disgrace. In the future, after equality and freedom, everyone will be treated the same as brothers. Only then will we see the word "sea" clearly.</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>An Artist With an Eccentric Personality</p>
<p>Because of different styles, because of his eccentric personality, Li Silian Howard has almost become a forgotten person. Not only are some of today's audiences very vague about him, but even in the film city of Hollywood, there is very little discussion, narrative, or even rumor about him. As far as he himself is concerned, this environment is not only harmless to him, but also perfectly suited to his needs, avoiding many unnecessary disturbances. But from the standpoint of film merchants, from a business perspective, it is simply walking on the path of self-destruction -- because he is not like Clark Gable and Gary Cooper and other stars who are used to showing off and can automatically do voluntary publicity for themselves and the studio. Moreover, he does not advocate playing roles that do not suit his personality, such as when he abandoned the role of Anthony in "Conquest" with Greta Garbo, because he was not so romantic and did not advocate being in love with it. Therefore, he starred in very few films, so people's impression of him is also very vague. On the screen, he gives us the personality of being stable, humble, generous, and sometimes he cannot hide his inner enthusiasm and innocence. Those who have seen "International Secret" will not forget the scene of him and Claire Francis flirting in the carriage, right? That kind of enthusiastic performance does not have any American-style frivolousness and obscenity. In "Of Human Bondage", he is again a mature-for-his-age character who is lured by an evil environment. Look, what a realistic personality this is! But people don't like him, because people want stimulation, they want frivolity and nonsense.</p>
<p>He is British, born in London on April 24, 1893. When he was in school, he was very fond of studying drama. After leaving school, he first worked as a bank clerk. When the war started, he abandoned his pen and joined the army. After the armistice, he became a professional actor; his first successful work on Broadway was "The Green Hat" with Katherine Cornell. Now he is both filming and appearing on stage, and he spends more time on the latter than the former. (To be continued)</p>
