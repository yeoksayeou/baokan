<p>— 柳</p>
<p>綜觀近來國內之經濟事態覺有兩項問題頗値討論請分述之第一投機之風自資金失其正當運用以來日趨熾盛如法幣將實行前之標金旣實行後之債券以及債券整理後之紗花粉麥狂漲巨跌掀然大波謂非投機在熱不可然從整個民族經濟着想並稍稍顧及將來則當知中國今日情勢决非可放手投機者蓋投機容或可取勝於一時其勢難久且暴利所入徒長揮霍之風習毀市塲之基礎投機者不幸而失敗則其事業隨之年來銀行之所以有倒閉淸理者其因大半在此此類銀行皆舍正道而不由偏重於大利之倖獲甚至主其事者獲利歸己失敗歸公一旦宣告淸理則瞠目結舌欲哭無淚者乃爲節衣縮食錙銖寸積之存戶存欵淸理動輒經年累月分期攤還則又雞零狗碎至以不願取贖受押處分之物分派於人然此類銀行在平時固無不以利息優厚保證確實及董經共負無限責任相號召事後存戶往往無力追求責任董經竟得逍遙事外一篇倒帳全向存戶身上攤去此等現象對於社會實有至惡之影響非亟謀補救不可</p>
<p>第二取締販私政府旣訂有嚴刑峻法商界且表示合作私貨應不難杜絕然大利所在經營者仍不乏其人私貨絡繹南來源源不絕時人常以同業公會對於此事未能發揮效力其因乃在各公會無强制同業加入之明文夫同業公會乃爲保障商家利益而設各商家理應無不樂於加入且公會如組織健全處置得宜則以法團身分亦未始不可使同業非會員同受拘束由是以觀今日各同業公會本身自尙應力求完備以博同業之信仰否則同業貌合神離縱令全體加入於公會業務有何補乎</p>
<p>抑工業輿商業利害不盡相同且有時相對立故以工商業歸入同一組織之中在或種之環境下確乎不便且依照農工鑛業團體登記規則及民法第四十八條組織之解釋工業經營者亦儘可獨樹一幟也</p>

<p>此約成立之初，曾經專家渣本氏（Chadourne）多所努力而　，然其結果如此，故各剛皆相繼到期廢除，（歐洲各國於去年八九月，秘魯，古巴於去年十二月，爪哇於今年三月度）最近雖有意擴大組織，但仍恐無多大合作之效果可言。</p>
<p>三　世界食糖之生產</p>
<p>歐洲　至於去年世界之糖產量，在歐洲方面。除攪克與英國因雨水不足仍有損失而致少收外，其餘各國大體上亦多在減縮中，去年全歐較前年省五五二千噸，茲將歐洲各國三年來收穫季所產之原糖列表於後：（單位千噸）</p>

<p>「讀書聲，紡織聲，小見啼哭聲」。從前的時侯，有了這三種聲音，以爲是家庭的祥瑞。現在的摩登家庭却不對了，成天的有着「無線電播音聲，麻雀劈拍聲，妻妾詬厲聲」。這三種聲音是多是歹？還要請閱者們批評一下。</p>
<p>從前人說：「咬得菜根，則百事可爲，」這是勉勵人「吃盡苦中苦方爲人上人」的意思。現今除非災民沒得吃，才肯咬菜根。此外一旦小得法，便要安富尊榮，怎肯在這些小事上用功夫！</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>太陽，無條件地射出光芒來，地球上的人類，無條件地吸收着太陽光，這似乎是再公平不過的一回子事，但是這話在鄉間說來，是百分之百的合理，在我們這個東方唯一大都市裏，這種說法，是該加上一個耳朵形的問題號。</p>
<p>在鄉間，在廣大的農塲上，孤零零地站着三間茅草屋，只須是天朗氣淸的日子，不拘寒暑，太陽從地平綫上爬起來，一直的到再從地平綫上墮下去時，茅草屋的四週，是不處沐不到太陽光的。茅草屋裏的人們，儘可享受着太陽光中無可量數的熱力，以及科學家們所說的殺菌力。</p>
<p>但是在我們這個都市中的太陽光，可就是被認作極可寶貴的一種東西了。普通同樣大小的一間屋子，向南的前樓，總比向北的後樓，貴上一倍，為的是向南的，一年四季，都可照着太陽光，或是望見太陽光，向北的，便終年沒有和太陽光接觸的機會。再如一個三層擱，苦在屋頂上開著一個天窗的，準也比不開天窗的每月貴上八角或是一元的房租，爲的是在天窗中，是有太陽光的照射的呀。</p>
<p>據外人的調查，弄堂房子中，儘有在一個石庫門裹，住簷七八家人家，有些是終年沒有太陽光照射的。在衛生問題方面，是很不相宜。道話，在衛生問題的立塲上瞧來，是很對的，但是道種住着洋房花園的外人，却怎樣知道太陽光在這都市裏是非花着高貴的代價，沒有享受的權利的呢。所以在一般的弄堂房屋中，晒台上地位的爭取，往往成爲同居者發生衝突的焦點，爲的是太陽光的供應太少，而太可貴了</p>
<p>我曾發着一個痴想，想把鄉開不値錢的太陽光，裝在瓶裏，或是裝在箱裏，或是裝在別種器皿裹，運進都市來販售。但是轉念一想，這是有些兒無謂，因爲沒錢住當有太陽光的屋子的人們，也未必有閒錢來購買太陽光去享受呀。</p>

<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>唯其如此，所以他伸出那雪白的手來，將雨簾子上面給按住，把頭伸到外面。那斜風吹了雨絲，向他臉上拂洒着，他並不怎樣的介意，依然呆了眼睛向前看着。國器看到他，向他作一們要點頭的姿勢。他倒不是那樣木然無動，向國器微微的笑着。拉人力車的車夫，他覺得坐在車上的女學生，一定是急於要回家去的，很快的把車子拖着，所以兩個人的對面時問，却是極短極短。國器在這時，是連對人作第二次微笑也來不及，更不用說開口了。雨一下，又是三天，他總是坐着車子。到了第四日，天氣是很晴期了，料着他今天是會步行的，心裏就鼓起了一百二十分的勇氣。覺得以往是太怯懦了，一個男子，對於一個朋友，連姓名也不敢聞，以後簡直不必出外交際了。好在怎樣開口問話，原來都想好了的，現在只要把說話的姿勢揣模好了，也就行了。見了他，千萬不必慌張，自然也不必害羞，，站定了脚，深深的和他點個頭。然後就說，小姐，我們天天見面，很熟了，我可以請問你貴姓嗎？他必定站定了笑說，你太客氣。於是就很大方的把姓名說出來。這一次，只能把話說到這裏爲止，再有什麼話，可要留到下次了。主意决定，這日上午，走到那相遇巷子裹的時候，自己心裏，首先亂跳，等人家走到了面前，自己臉皮紅了。不但不能開口，把往日見着人家略略點頭的那分慣例，也給丟了，竟是微微的低着頭走了過去。等到人家已經走得很遠，自己悔恨起來，已經是補救不及了。因爲這一冋的熊度，未免是做得慌張一點，到了這日下午，却不敢有這種嘗試。再過一日，自己又把勇氣鼓勵起來。由家裏出門的時候，脚踏在地上，都格外的沉着，每一步路，都踏得響些。好像在這一點上，也表現着他已下了决心。到了那巷子裏時，遠遠的偷看迎面來的小姐，裝束難然是很整齊的，然而他的臉子，却沉沉的向下扳着，彷佛　　　生氣。這是生我的氣嗎？慢來慢來，今天可不能去冒這個險了，日子長哩，等着機會　。於是在這猶豫的時候，又過了四五天。不過這四五天之間，情形有些不同了，有時可以遇到他，有時又遇不着他。（四一）</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>自己在好久以前，就想到幾處公路上去巡禮一番的，可是為了沒有機會，所以終於把這擔心　無形地　擱了下來，並且，便這樣漸漸地將它淡忘了。</p>
<p>前天，我為了要到農村去調查一點　　生活的情形，於是，我又復引起了那個淡忘的動機；在一個月色朦朦的早晨，由那輛　　型的銀色汽車，　著我爬上了那條漫長而蜿蜒的公路。</p>
<p>我們由四川路出發，經過大都會的一角，那時大都會猶在睡眠狀態中。後來從閘北出去，過了太陽廟，喇叭是咆哮似的吼着，汽車是風馳電掣的飛著，我們就把一些草棚，一些勞働的人們很快的拋到後面，而在我們面前出現的，便是一大片廣　無垠的原野。</p>
<p>天空漸漸的明朗了。有些地方憶灑上了一層金色可愛的陽光，帶着點季節味兒的晨風，從車窗裏探進頭來，輕輕地吻着我的臉。使我的心裏感到無限的興奮和愉快！</p>
<p>車過了眞如，便像一只不緊的小舟，在大自然的海裏　着似的，加快了速率在公路上奔，車身也像小船兒在激浪裏一樣的顚簸着。由那寂寞的晨風飄送進來的，一陣一陣的麥香和花草香，不禁使我想起了如今正是割麥播種的時期了。</p>
<p>向着原野的深處前進，許多田畦，許多阡陌，都在我眼前淸楚地，同時也糢糊地閃了過去；在靠近鐵路的時候，還能够看見那班山上海開出的三四等客車，正像一頭可怕的野獸似的在向着前面衝去，那轟條轟隆的聲音，却震撼得地球也有點動搖，幾聲尖銳的吼呌將凝固着的長空也劃了開來，使那靜穆的空氣也在抖索了。</p>
<p>一叠一叠的黑烟，彷彿是染黑了的棉絮似的從「龍頭」上吐出來，拋棄在空際，任它在郊原里浮盪着。——</p>
<p>田畦裏已稀稀落落地有些農人在工作了；男的女的，有的站簷在犂泥，有的傴僂着在刈麥，拔豆，有的却巳在薄水田裏挿秧了。</p>
<p>村舍，田陌，橋樑，……都從我眼底裏溜了過去；在兩小時以後，那條灰色的古老城垣已如　死蛇般的在我面前躺着，不久，我便吩咐車子在新閭門停了下來。—我看看自家腕上的手表，恰巧是七點敲過，而這時，上海日報公會那輛送報汽車也巳到了蘇州。</p>

<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>下海啦？」！</p>
<p>裸着腿，携着漁具，一夥兒往黃海走去，他們是捕捉蟀蛾的　漁民，而且全靠黃海裏水產　過生活的；因爲沒錢造海船，所以在海灘上　捕捉蛼蛾，担往市上售賣。</p>
<p>他們懂得潮汛，退了潮之後，蛼蛾全在海灘上面，捕捉很便利的。每一個人蹲着身子，脚趾陷在泥土中，臉上掛着笑，捉了蛼蛾投入漁麓，嘴裏唱着　沒節奏的調子。海灘上浮着許多的脚印。</p>
<p>『隆隆！隆隆！』</p>
<p>兩條黑色的牛，背着車往海里走去，牛背上坐着一個漁民，車上堆滿了漁網，這是上海船去的，預備明天潮來的時候捕魚的。</p>
<p>荒漠似的海濱，點綴着幾所茅舍，泥土給日光曝晒後泛出一層　雪白的鹽質。白茫茫的水，望去水天接連着的，僅有幾隻海船停泊　在海中，也有幾隻擱在海灘上的海船，還望得見牛車在水裏移動，海風多麽猛烈？站着有些飄蕩，海灘邊漁民的頭顱　在蠕蠕的動。　『趕市去啦！』</p>
<p>漁麓裏裝滿了　蛼蛾，站起了身就跑，往長沙還有十五里路，幾條腿飛快的過去，還在估量負着漁麓裏的　蛼蛾的價値，五十鈔，（註）八十鈔，但不滿一百鈔的。</p>
<p>許多的漁民，給日光曝晒着，全身發着熱，額上淌着汗，赤着負膊着漁麓跑，沿着牛車痕跑去，漸漸地在海濱的一角消逝。（註）鈔銅元</p>

<h3 id="c241">存天閣讀畫 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 盧印泉</p>
<p>海粟先生旣將舉其傑作數百點，與國人相見於滬上，僕因少吼之介，輒於存天閣中得先睹之快。</p>
<p>僕於西畫爲門外漢，雖閣中滿目琳琅，初不敢置一詞，但一觀其「黃山」「殘荷」諸作，竟以熱烈之油彩，寫國畫瀟疏澹蕩之氣，創造魄力，自由逼人矣。</p>
<p>閣主舊作國畫，多筆墨豪健，恣意縱橫，其滂礴之氣，奔放之情，躍然紙上，莫敢仰視，新作則風格少異，由滂礴而精神內欽，由奔放而矩度謹嚴，因其養深蓄厚，故能歛海者分位置，以漱雪嚼冰者歸峻潔，以水到渠成者還自然，庶乎近之。</p>
<p>時閣主為予論我華繪事，謂：佛教東來，受其薰陶，藝術大進，但歴六朝隋唐之間，皆附庸於佛教，支配於印度，逮吳道玄李思訓王維諸大師挺生盛唐，始振其天才，本之自我，創爲我華獨立偉大之畫格，五代宋元間生雋者，其藝大成，但明淸以降，每况愈下，北派流爲院體，更下降爲刻板界畫，南派流爲文人畫，更下降爲四王之庸俗。近代歐風東漸，藝術隨之，其師承四王者，則夜郎自大，懷敝帚而自珍，醉心西畫者，則一得自炫，鄙國故而不爲。不知藝術爲自我精神之最高表現，勢須秉盛唐諸大師之精神，以此時此地之自我為中心，以往古歐西之優點為根據，用完成我華繪事之獨立人格也。</p>
<p>僕於繪事初未窺共門徑，但因閣主之意見，參以個人之直覺，則以國畫優點，全在「眞實對象，與賅括印象之綜合表現」也。對象爲具體之自然，印象爲抽象之觀念，始於觀察，繼以剪裁，終以自我表現，國畫之能事盡矣。故國畫初不若西人有寫實浪漫象微各派之分，但在國畫之六法中，各派精神，幾盡包括，但言寫實，初非對物臨摩，如西畫之寫生，而為觀之以目，存之以神，與趣既來，隨筆成境，言象微亦非憑空幻想，漫寫天國，而盡取五嶽之雄奇，而綜合表現於尺幅之上；如寫美人，則盡取西施王嬙之美麗，而綜合表現于一人。此種表現手法，非寫實非象徵而為鍜練自然綜合表現。具體言之，如寫雲山則意在實具各派之長，故益足引人入勝。予觀閣主寫實寫意話題傑作，殆皆能運用共絕技，以發揮國畫固有之精神者。卽寫區區一八哥，輒蓄八哥以十計，日觀其眠食飛鳴之姿，入目存神，筆墨一到，乃能窮神，使徒取八哥而對之臨摩，縱能得其毛羽這眞，必難得其飛躍之神，眞成死八哥矣。</p>
<p>然國畫非無缺點，言法度則無寫實派之比例透視，言情緒則無浪漫派之熱烈奔放，外此如內容上之積極意義，彩墨之樂觀情感，在須取人之長，補已之短耳。</p>

<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>候藥一辭，不見於載籍。憶曩習動物學，鳥之隨節候往來者，謂之候烏；蟲之應節候產生者，謂之候蟲。鶯燕嗔叱，感春之來臨；蟋蟀啾嗚，慨秋之蒞止；外物示人之深切，有如此者。</p>
<p>診餘無俚，展讀報章，見夫十滴水，痧藥水等之廣告，五光十色，映入眼底；於茲乃知寒去暑來，炎夏節季，又在人間矣。藥依季而現，季以藥而明，因謂之候藥，誰曰不宜？</p>
<p>此類藥物，名目繁多，舉例，明之曰：保安水，時疫危症藥水，神功濟衆水，急救時疫痧藥水，濟生十滴水，一心水，奪命水，普濟藥水，神水，至聖水，急救痧症藥水等，無慮數十百積。時至今日，十滴水之流行，雖窮鄉僻壤，亦見蹤跡；此無他內中含有麻醉劑，興奮劑，易投人所好，一也。售價低廉，貧窮階級，力能購買，二也。慈善家行善積德，購以施送，作有力之推銷，三也。</p>
<p>我國民智淺陋，向來人云亦云，自易受人蠱惑，乃造成今日盲目信仰十滴水之怪現象。當夏秋之際，普通上中下社會之人，凡身感不適，腹痛，瀉泄？及其他熱性病初期者，輒謂之發痧，刮痧之外，常用以治療。此種症狀，其本可經相當時間消失者，則諉爲十滴水之功；無效，亦不受過。</p>
<p>此種藥品之成分，多非國產，海通以後，西方醫術，傳入中土，遂與之俱來；然立方始自何人，製造始於何時，均不可考。據檢查之報吿，就上海受檢之五十三種痧藥水言，其中含有麻醉藥及　其他毒藥者，约居十分之六，不含毒藥者，居十分之四。（見民國十九年中央衛生試騐所年報）要之不外下列諸藥，加减或變換而成。</p>
<p>一，鴉片酒，</p>
<p>二，番木鼇酒，</p>
<p>三，複方大黃酒，</p>
<p>四，樟腦酒，</p>
<p>五，香椒酒，</p>
<p>六，纈草酒，</p>
<p>七，薄荷酒，</p>
<p>就藥物作用上言，鴉片酒有止痛止瀉之效，功力顯著，其餘係興奮，强心，健胃，鎭靜之劑。此等藥物之合劑，用於單純性蠕動過劇之腹痛腹瀉（如腹部受寒冷刺戟所誘起者），比較相宜。其不含麻醉藥者，用於因熱之暈卒，亦無可議。至若眞性霍亂，痢疾，急性胃腸炎，以及因積食而　起之腹瀉，用之有害無無益。蓋腹瀉爲一病狀，而非病，源，首應淸導。若僅以止瀉爲目標，初期卽用含鴉片之止瀉劑，反使病菌長留腸內，爲害實大。其瀉下頻劇者，則非此十滴水所能爲力，求治心切者，常服用過量，致呈急性鴉片中毒現象。小兒服之，尤易中毒，因小兒對於鴉片感受性敏銳也。又有恃痧藥水服過，不肯卽刻就醫診治，坐失治療時機，貽誤益甚。</p>
<p>總之，不論何種痧藥水，在醫療上絕無地位可言，純正之醫家，藥囊內，藥橱內，並無此物之踪跡也。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>近年以來，心臟與血管之疾病，日益增加，而成爲最嚴重之國民病。蓋本病之原因孔多而複雜，且本病之早期認識，亦頗不易，益以社會文明日進，人事愈紛，嗜好益夥，在在足以釀成本病於不知不覺之中也。</p>
<p>心臟者，並非一個單獨自主之器官，乃係全身循環器之中心點，故心臟與血管有密切之關係。而心臟疾病，一方固可由心臟自己的疾病變化而來，一方亦可因血管之疾病而起，如血浪之進行，發生阻力，心臟之力量，不能勝任等。故最近世界各國，對於循環器疾病與心臟疾病之研究，日益進展，而二者並重焉。</p>
<p>心臟疾病之增加，爲普通的現象，爲國家的與國際的問題，此Vogl之定論也。在十九世紀之末，德國巴榮地方之軍隊，因循環器疾病而致退休者，增出一倍以上。在普羅士之軍隊，其退休人數，幾增出三倍以上。在瑞士亦有同樣之現象。又北美合衆國衛生署報吿，自一八九二年起，心職與腎臟疾病，有顯明之增加。而人民之死亡總數，則漸行低减。最可注意者，在一萬居民中，在一九三一年，有二十八例之死亡數，在一九〇五年，僅有二十一例，同樣因循環器疾病而死亡。又有一驚人之統計（一九三一年）如下。</p>
<p>每一百個死亡例中</p>
<p>七例因結核而死亡</p>
<p>一〇。九　　　　　死亡</p>
<p>之疾病現象，大多發現於四十與六十歲之間，而大都市中，有高等職業者，尤有險惡之比例，如維也納之醫師，患有循環器疾病者，占百分之三十四。二五，而其餘人民，僅占首分十五。八四而巳。我國最近如胡展堂氏及昔譚故院長之逝世，其原因均多由於循環器疾病。某餘見諸雜誌報章之紀載，因上項疾病而死亡者，幾日有所聞。故循環器疾病正確之認識，及其早期診斷，不特爲我醫家當今最大之努力，卽一般注意健康者，亦當注意及之，未雨綢繆，斯爲上耳。</p>
<p>去春不佞赴歐考察新醫學，訪德國之拿海姆溫泉，此爲全歐最著名之心瞬療養地，各國主公貴人，多養疴於斯。其地風物幽美，儼如世外桃源。而其間心臟研究院之設立，尤聞名於世。其研究本病之最要工具，厥爲電氣自動測騐機Flek　trocardiograph。蓋人體安靜而無別種肌肉動作時，祗有心臟功能發生一種活動電流，吾人將此活動電流，引導於人體之兩端而擴大之，其動作經過極微細之游絲，因極强之電磁力，發生擺動，用顯微鏡放大此種動作之陰影於照相紙帶上，此卽所謂電氣自動測騐也。吾人俱知心臟之動作，由於一定之刺激而自動發生，此種刺激的中心，及神經傳導，係由前心房起傳至心室者，其有規律之動作，一旦發生障礙，不論在心臟之前後左右，吾人均可應用此種自動測騐正確診斷之。惟此項機械，不特其代價昂貴，且構造亦複雜非常，卽在彼邦，非研究院亦無此設備，以我國社會智識之落後，自更視爲神秘而不敢輕於嘗試，其實本機不特對於心臟本身之疾病，卽於循環器疾病，如血管硬化，血壓過高，其餘如因腎臟疾病，糖尿病，急性傳染病，肺病，酒精鴉片嗜好等症，引起之心臟衰弱症象，俱可用此診斷其程度之如何，又如於施行大手術前，或應用强心藥劑以後，欲觀其心臟機能之變化如何，是否可以施行手術，藥劑之功效如何，此項診斷，亦捨斯機莫屬矣，不佞學識　陋，雖有是項之設備，惟一切研究之進展，端賴諸同志之予以匡助，想亦爲同志諸君所樂許者歟。</p>

<p>那幾種傳染病，　可以誘發這種病呢？</p>
<p>像寒傷，　再歸熱，天花等傳染病，　都可以誘起這種病的。</p>
<p>那幾種毒物中毒，　可以誘發這種病呢？</p>
<p>仿，六〇六，　九一四和毒菌等中　毒的時候，可以誘發　這種病變。　急性黃色　肝萎縮病，發生和性別　或年齡有關係嗎？</p>
<p>大概侵犯　三十歲到四十歲的妊娠　婦和產褥婦</p>
<p>這種病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>病狀可以分做二期。</p>
<p>第一期的病狀怎樣？</p>

<p>第三期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>第二期的病狀，　是重劇的神經症狀，　現劇烈的頭痛，不安，　不眠，譫妄，痙攣，　嗜眠，昏睡等。　同時肝臟縮小，數夫之後，　縮到正常的一半或四分之一。　脾臟却往往腫大。　又發重症的黃疸，皮膚，　黏膜，胃腸，　子宮等處見出血</p>
<p>病人的小便，　有變化嗎？</p>
<p>尿中含膽　汁色素和膽汁液，　尿素的量减少，有時見少量的　蛋白質。含有特有的Leucin　和Tyrosin。</p>
<p>大便有變化嗎？</p>
<p>大便秘結，　呈黏土狀，脈搏頻數　每分鐘有一百二十至　三百四十次。</p>
<p>病人的體溫，　在這時期比較普通昇高多少？</p>

<p>病人的血液，　起什麽變化？</p>
<p>血液中赤　血球增多，血色素上昇。　白血球也增多。</p>
<p>怎樣診斷這種病呢？</p>
<p>初期診斷很　是困難。應該和十二指　腸性黃疸，急性憐中　毒和惠爾氏病相區別。</p>
<p>預後的吉凶如何？</p>
<p>絕對不良。　發病後二三星期內，　一定致命。</p>
<p>怎樣治療　急性黃色肝萎縮病？</p>
<p>祇有用胰島素，葡萄糖的注射。　如有梅毒，可行驅梅法。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c247">牙齒常識問答（三五） <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第七章　牙患的治療</p>
<p>（第一七五問）　慢性傳染牙根膜炎，怎樣醫治？</p>
<p>答　此即慢性齒槽膿瘡，分無瘻管和有瘻管的，應先車開髓室，擴大根端孔，以梗放膿，用棉花浸消毒藥，封入根管，每日換藥，至膿盡毫無臭味為止，然後再行將根管填補。若已成瘻管之膿瘡，則可用藥水由髓室注入，從瘻管流出，洗去膿污，用腐蝕劑消除瘻管。此外又有外科手術療法，把齒槽骨擊開，切去牙根端部，刮除膿瘡以求根治的。</p>
<p>（第一七六問）　患急慢性齒槽膿瘡時，患牙能夠保留嗎？</p>
<p>答　上述的各種療法，很費手續，而且結果很難穩定，往往須經過長期治療，依然徒勞無功，這是由於膿菌深藏牙根端患部，不易完全剷除的緣故。所以若是治療無效，或牙齒殘缺無用，或是有合併症的時候，即宜將患牙拔去，勉強保留，徒增痛苦。但在急性症候未消退時，非有特別情形，不宜即拔。</p>
<p>第四節　關於齒槽膿漏症的治療</p>
<p>（第一七七問）　初期齒槽膿漏症怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　用特製儀器，刮去齒石，再用適宜的收斂劑塗佈齒齦部若干次，並宜常用漱口藥水含漱。</p>
<p>（第一七八問）　已成膿袋的齒槽膿漏症怎樣治療？</p>
<p>答　先將膿袋內所有齒石膿污等，洗刮清淨，塗以收斂劑。頑固的症，須用腐蝕劑以腐潰患部。藥物治療無效時，可用外科手術，割除膿袋。諸法均無效果時，必須將患牙拔去，以免傳染鄰齒。除局部塗佈藥外，尚有內服劑注射劑等，有時能奏卓效。</p>
<p>（第一七九問）　對於已經動搖的牙齒怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　可用器械裝饟使其固植，病勢退後，或能恢復原有的固植力。</p>
<p>（第一八〇問）　由於全身所致的齒槽膿漏症，怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　首在治愈其病原，如糖尿病花柳病等。至局部治療所需的手術和藥物等，與前述相同，不過此等病症，應該牙醫生和普通醫生二方面合作，方易收效。</p>
<p>（第一八一問）　一般齒槽膿漏症的患者，爲什麽要耐心和牙醫生合作？</p>
<p>答　因為此症須長期的治療，如果病家不能夠和醫生嚴密合作，聽從他的指導，雖然有優良的療法，也不能得永確的效果？</p>
<p>（第一八二問）　病家自身應該怎樣注意衛生？</p>
<p>答　　大便不可使秘結，宜多飲水及多食果蔬糙米等，以增加胃腸的活動。　口中所有的膿液，不宜嚥下。　食後即宜漱口。　多得日光和新鮮空氣。　不可縱欲過勞，但適當運動，則很有益。</p>
<p>第五節　關於牙痛的治療</p>
<p>（第一八三問）　我們怎樣會感覺牙痛？</p>
<p>答　因為牙齒或其他部份有了毛病。分佈在牙齒部份的三叉神經，受其刺激，所以感痛。所以牙痛不能算獨立的病，牠不過是一種警告，表示病患的存在，使得我們可以趕快去醫治。</p>

<h3 id="c248">如何緝駐 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 子彬</p>
<p>上海市各界緝私協會已於日前成立了，關於他們的立塲和工人，宣言中說得很明白：「……冀以民衆自動之立塲、協助政府，檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸，以維國家經濟命脈，尙望全國同胞，一致奮起，杜絕私貨……」。</p>
<p>私貨之該禁，除了漢奸之外，原是全國同胞所熱烈主張的；但是，怎樣禁法呢？緝私協會雖然提出了二項原則，曰：「檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸」；並且還推定了幾個人起草組織大綱及工作大綱，但是這樣籠統的規定和牛平化的辦法，於實際上是否能收成效，這在我們實在不能無疑！</p>
<p>因爲，　人謀我的陰謀，到現在是與日俱進了，他們已撕去偽善的面具，以武力來保障走私，正因這樣，所以我們越覺得以前的老法子已不够來對付目前的環境，何况，呌唯利是圖的漢奸來講良心旣談不上，而國人除貪便宜之外，對私貨又不能澈底認淸呢？</p>
<p>所以，我覺得，所謂「檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸」，這未免是我們把事情看得太簡單了。</p>
<p>然而，我們就知難而退嗎？當然不的！我同意於「檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸」這一個主張，同時我敢相信每一個中國國民也都同意於這個主張，就因爲同意於這個主張的緣故，我們要使我們的主張兌現，我們要用武力來制止走私！</p>
<p>前目，也惟有用武力才能制止走私！</p>
<p>談到如何緝私之餘，我又想到了實騐小劇塲與螞蟻劇團的「走私」等劇被迫禁演的事情來，在中國的領土以內，描寫　人在中國境內「走私」等實情的戲劇尙小能上演，則我不知道世界各國中是否尙承認有中國的存在？現在，雖有人向納稅華人會要求向工部局提出嚴重抗議了，然而爲了聲援起見，緝私協會就該當仁不讓的首先起來力爭，不然，描寫「走私」實情的戲劇尙不能上演，更何况乎「檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸」！</p>
<h3 id="c249">讀「南遊十記」（下） <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 台生</p>
<p>現在摘幾段來看看：</p>
<p>在第七記「山水橋洞」裏，作者寫沿湘粵公路的鐵路工程，這裏有一段文學很美麗：</p>
<p>「手搖車架上了鐵軌，張工程司和我們，便在人工劈開的兩山中前進。山是赭紅色，石頭大大小小，奇形怪狀，田螺，如磨盤，如獅如狗。……至於兩如面所看見的，上面是重重疊疊，綿延不絕的峯巒，下面是灣灣曲曲，源遠流長的碧水，山隨水轉，水繞山流，風景美麗，如在圖畫之中……。」又如：的</p>
<p>第八記「廣州名勝」裏，對於廣州記述得很淸楚。作者到了粵秀山參觀了中山紀念堂，又去了黃花崗，憑弔了「七十二烈士墓」，又在十九路軍將士紀念碑徘徊甚久；作者又提起廣州沙面的英法租界，作者說：</p>
<p>「……相傳這個沙面租界，旣無租賃的年限，又無租賃的條約，西人每年還出幾百塊錢的租費，從這一點，我們對於以前政府所辦的外交，不能不深致慨歎。想起當年沙基的慘案，經行現在的六二三路，內心的痛苦，是不用說的。」這幾句話，說得很沉痛。</p>
<p>第九記是「澳門中山」，作者三月十二日下午由香港乘港粵澳汽艇向澳門進發。</p>
<p>澳門近來在葡萄牙人烟賭毒酖政策之下，使澳門中國人，都永遠深陷在這個不㧞的火坑裹，所以作者走進澳門旅館裏的時候，他寫：</p>
<p>「……當電梯停止，我踏到二層樓時，一股鴉片烟的氣味，向我鼻孔要直攅，在每一個房間短門下，又可以窺見男女兩人的四條腿，橫擺在兩隻方櫈上，無疑地，是〇在床上大抽其鴉片烟。此外，打牌的聲音，劈劈拍拍，說話的聲音，嘻嘻哈哈，幾十個房間，沒有一間空的。」</p>
<p>其實我們知道上海租界上的旅館，又何嘗不如此呢？</p>
<p>此外澳門大規模的賭塲，不知有多少家，這些也都是葡萄牙人對付中國人最狠毒的政策。所以，最後作者寫！</p>
<p>「葡萄牙人雖然以烟賭政策來榨取中國人的金錢，可是近幾年來，全世界遭逢着不景氣的侵襲，澳門又何能不受影響呢？烟賭的收入，現在一年减少一年，葡人無計可施，竟巧立名目來徵稅，譬如電燈也須收稅，什麼也須收稅，但是所得的結果，還是入不敷出。澳門的前途，照這樣情形，葡萄牙人總是不安的。」這一段文字，對澳門葡萄牙人，是給予確最眞實的揭露的。</p>
<p>澳門以外，作者又到中山去，拜訪了孫總理的故居。</p>
<p>最後一章，是第十記的「香港游觀。」在這裏，作者叙述了香港，九龍租借給英國簡單的歷史，此外除掉游覽香港，九龍，淺水灣，空中電車以外，作者更指出了香港市面的不景氣，以及日貨充塞市塲。</p>
<p>香港是美麗的，尤其是淺水灣海水浴塲那一帶，作者幾乎用了詩的調子，來歌謳淺水灣：我們看：</p>
<p>「我最愛淺水灣了！在淺水灣飯店的長廊上，望着明靜如鏡的海水，和蔚藍的天空，四周靜悄悄地，一點聲息都沒有，整個的心靈，是在碧海靑天懷抱之中。尤其是飯店前一片廣大的草坪，緣得令人愛煞；東北角上有一段花棚，上面都垂着一束一束的黃花，處處顯出濃艷的春光。……」</p>
<p>關於後面附錄的「漢粵記行」，因爲篇幅的關係，從略。</p>
<h3 id="c250">花鼓戲（續） <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>大概唱一天花鼓戲，連同飯食，祇有十來塊錢就够了，所以是輕而易舉的。演唱花鼓戲的時侯，就在農村裏的塲角上，用草薦木板，塔成了一隻戲臺，每天演日夜兩塲。夜塲呢，那個戲臺上面，倒掛了兩隻竹畚箕，裏面舖些泥，放了兩盞大的煤油燈，分列在左右兩邊，爲了燈芯的粗大，就是有狂風吹來，也不會熄滅的。</p>
<p>某一個農村之中在演花鼓戲，遠近的人們得到消息之後，都會趕去看的，甚至十多里以外的人，也會去看，更爲了夜晚大家沒有事情做，比較空閒些，所以看戲的人也來得熟鬧，月白風淸之</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>夜，在舖着一層黑色的幕幔的農村之中一，有一個塲角，燈燭輝煌，在上演花鼓一戲，看戲的人大家立着靜聽，那麼和上海的舞臺裹面的情形，當然是絕對不同，而另有一種平民化的情調。</p>
<p>花鼓戲上演的時候，照例在正戲之前，要來一次打陽調，所謂打陽調者，猶如唱彈詞的在正書之前，先要唱一雙開篇。花鼓戲的戲目之中，雖然有的戲劇，上臺的角色，也有四五人乃至七八八人之多，但大都是生旦兩角對唱的，那個生角，鄉下人更稱之爲「西洋」，取義何在，我們是不得而知的。</p>
<p>唱花鼓戲的人，大半是無師傳授的，胡琴的過門，另成一調，原初　沒有正式的曲譜，而所有的花鼓戲劇，更大半口傳，沒有脚本，唱戲的人儘可就各人的隨機應變而略加變動，並不拘束。不過唱句是有韻的，而且對於韻脚看得很重。</p>
<p>大约在二十年前，所有的旦角，都由男人裝扮，直到後來，才由女人學唱花鼓戲，從此花鼓戲中，所有女角，便都可由女人充任，不過不完備的班子，直到現在，女角還是由男人扮演的。上海游戲塲勃興之後，花鼓戲班也就被羅致得來，並美其名曰申曲。據說花鼓戲的發源地，的確在上海附近，像浦束，七寳一帶，所以稱之曰申曲，還可說妥貼，而我們鄉下有人稱花鼓戲爲束鄉調，也就爲了這個原故，就是西鄉的人演唱花鼓戲，也要學東鄉日音的。</p>
<p>花鼓戲的戲目之中，有許多是很淫穢的，但比較好的也未始沒有，祇因爲鄉下的人們，和上海人愛看白玉霜的「馬寡婦開店」一樣，總是歡迎低級趣味的劇本，所以十九要點唱淫詞穢曲，而結果，要給當局把花鼓戲有傷風俗，加以禁止。其實花鼓戲而能够改良一下，除去淫穢戲曲，專演喚起農村民衆的戲目，在上海的附近一帶，我以爲是最眞偉大動力的一種通俗戲劇。</p>
<h3 id="c251">海葬曲 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 朱露</p>
<p>海長嘯着。</p>
<p>在海風裏，一個婦人脚躅地踱着，海風吹得她長髮飄散，刮得她衣裳發出摔乡的聲音。那婦人的面孔異樣蒼白，一雙脚赤裸着，踏過了堆積着的碎殼。</p>
<p>海水汹湧着。</p>
<p>她的脚步，踏在沙泥上，一步步地走去，沙土上留着陷下的脚跡，她歡迎着狂風，在海灘上走着。</p>
<p>她瘋顚地在走，讓着海水飄過來冲着她的脚趾，她的眼睛死滯地望着大海，眼光裏充滿了憤怒和怨恨。</p>
<p>海潮漲了。</p>
<p>她的面孔抽搐着，嘴張得大大，任着海風湧灌進咽喉，厲害地作呃起來。她的頭髮蓬亂得像着野鬼，手抽筋般蜷握着，頭衝向大風裏。</p>
<p>她瘋在地呌着，聲音那麼慘厲。</p>
<p>她的一雙脚，在海灘上跳着，海水濺起了水沫。</p>
<p>她的眼光沉滯地望着滾滾的海水，彷彿透過了大海，射到黝暗的地方去了。她眼前大海像隱淡進去，現着一個個浮腫的死屍。</p>
<p>過去的記憶，一幕幕現出起來。</p>
<p>她悲憤地想着，海是葬埋了她家三代的人。</p>
<p>當她還在童年時，海奪去了她爹，她長大了，海又奪去了她丈夫，十年過去了，在昨天海又葬理了她唯一的孩子</p>
<p>大海奪去了她的幸福，大海從她懷裏搶去了她一個個親愛的人，大海淹沒了她一切的希望，她癫在地想着，眼睛裏滿溢着熱淚。</p>
<p>她從小就恨透了大海。</p>
<p>記得在幼小時，她在拾着蚌殼，爹被海葬的打擊，終斷了安靜的童年，她被送到另一個漁夫那裏，她大了，結了婚慢慢快要恢復幸福時，海又奪去了她的丈夫，她的漁船，她辛苦度着日子，直倒十年後，她把最後幸福的希望，書托在英俊孩子的身上，在一個風暴天，海又吞沒了她的兒子，——海葬埋了她三代的人。</p>
<p>重重的租稅，滾堆上去的債，使着一個個親　的人，離開了她的擁抱，投向着大海，被海葬埋掉。他們都很年輕，都有着極好的希望，一個個從大地生長，却一個個被海吞沒。</p>
<p>他們都懂得海是危險的，他們一個個被着窮困鞭撻在大海裏去找着活路，一個個變成了海的俘虜。</p>
<p>她記得昨天，孩子在帆船上駛出去時，她還望見了他湧滿靑春光輝的臉，和健實的身子，她暗暗地還替他祈禱「願他平安回來」！</p>
<p>一個大風暴的攻襲，她的孩子是不會回來了，海殘酷奪沒了她的一切。</p>
<p>她把一個個心愛的人，施予了大海裏，海却帶來，施給她的——從海水飄送來的一些破木板，衣衫，和着零星的東西。</p>
<p>她憤怒着，眼睛仇視着海水。</p>
<p>海咆哮了，海水浸到脚膝，滾滾的水高漲着，海浪湧着。</p>
<p>她忿怒地伸出着拳頭，撲向大海裏，她發在地在潮水裏亂衝。</p>
<p>她的脚陷下去，她掙扎着，陷得更深了，她的身子抖着，一陣海潮冲得她搖動了。</p>
<p>她死命的怒吼一聲，那吼聲那樣悲慘尖厲，包含着幾代的憤怒一生的怨恨。</p>
<p>海水浸沒了她的胸脯……</p>
<p>海潮湧得像沸騰了。</p>
<h3 id="c252">虎疫 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 魯夫</p>
<p>農村生活加快綠之一——</p>
<p>擄說今年是「虎疫年」</p>
<p>虎疫是學術的新名詢，俗稱爲霍亂，老百姓呌做瘟疫症，而且說是因爲瘟神震怒而降的災禍，所以北國的鄉鎭上，常常看到瘟神廟。</p>
<p>一般農民們，因爲知道是瘟神震怒纔鬧着瘟疫症，自然得瘟疫症的人們，就應拈香燒紙，建壇設醮，希望瘟神大發慈悲，能以早日息怒而化凶爲吉，不能不向瘟神伏首了。</p>
<p>民國二十一年秋，當瘟疫症沿膠濟路綫向濟南邁進的時侯，我正在膠東距膠濟鐵路四五十里的小縣裏做小學敎員，是在離開縣城十幾里的一座小鎭上。全鎭上的人們，都擔心着瘟神的降臨，家家戶戶燒着香，燒着紙，香味和紙灰，佈滿了全鎭的天空。</p>
<p>小學校的訓育先生，是個極端反對迷信的人，每次上課，總要提出一部分時間來，討論瘟疫的間題。並且特別組織了破除迷信的宣傳隊，分組出發，向全鎭上的農民解釋瘟疫預防法和治療法。最有效的辦法，自然是防疫針，但當時鎭上却沒有這樣設置。爲了預防瘟疫的發生，雖然積極方面缺乏設備，消極方面，立刻由鄉公所停止了肉商的生意，並禁止吃小熟的水菜和生水，那正是西瓜過時的末夏時候。</p>
<p>瘟神並沒有爲了燒香燒紙而减少了他的殺氣，全縣境有三分之二以上的農村已經跌落在他的魔手中了！這座小鎮上，第一個人，是一個年靑壯丁，正在田裏做工，一頭栽倒地下死去了！當天晚上，全鈸上都知道了這件驚人的消息。香的烟味，紙的灰屑，又加上了鞭砲的聲音，這夜裏，全鈸異常的熱鬧起來</p>
<p>小學校裏，因爲剛開學，外鄉的學生們，多半爲瘟疫的原因不能來，人很少。只有半數是本鎭上的學生。當一個小學生哭着來請假的時候，又一個學生也哭着來請假，一個報吿着他媽媽病死了！一個報吿着他爹爹病死了！第二天早上，請假的小學生，也死去了！瘟疫症，慢的二十幾小時死，快的，躺倒地下，一挺腿就死去，而且得病就不省人事，吃湯藥困難得很，最便利的還是針法。這座小鎭上，唯一的一位老秀才中醫，只會開湯藥方，不懂針法。所以得病求醫的，只有到外鄕去。某一得了瘟疫症的人家，派人到外鄕去請針法醫生，恰巧那位醫生正在一家得瘟疫症的人家治病，不但沒有治好病人的病，他竟一頭栽倒病牀下死了！請醫生的人，不但沒有把醫生請了來，反而死在醫生的家裏。早上抬了病死的棺材的人，晚上，又被旁人來抬自己。全鎭上，交響着悲慘的哭聲，街頭上，跑來跑去的遍滿了穿了孝服的孩子。每天，當暮色蒼茫的時候，鞭砲聲裏，加雜着「呌魂」的悽厲曳長的調子，天氣是悶熱成一塊整的，在焚毀着死者衣物的火光裏，蒸升着腥臭般般的夏天的熱風。</p>
<p>北方出喪的鄉俗，有「打瓦」的節目，是在出喪的時候，摔碎西而新瓦。因爲學校正在修理敎室，所以每天下午，出入着含了眼淚借瓦的人。學校的瓦，每天不斷的借着，人是不斷的被瘟神摧殘着性命！當學校的北鄰，傳過哭聲的時候，我們被嚇得搬到前院來，前鄰又送來了哭聲；大家再搬到中間，四鄰都發出哭聲的時候，學校不得不被迫着放假了！固然因為教員們不能安下心的教下去，學生們，也慢慢的少了起來。</p>
<p>據鄉老們說：「瘟神講年頭的，轉過年頭來，就會好了。」全鎭上纔又在無法可想的絕路上，决定了「過新年」的日子。無論是大財主，窮光蛋，都在揮着夏天的汗來籌備過「新年。」就在充滿了「新年」景象的那天早上，我同反對迷信瘟神的训育先生，嚇得離開了那座小鎭。</p>
<p>從鎭上到縣城的路上，每個村子裏，滿街上，跑來跑去的穿了孝服的孩子，每個人，都拉看一副憂愁的臉子，到處聽到的是哭聲，鞭砲聲，悽厲曳長的「呌魂」聲。陣陣熱風吹來了香的烟味，燒紙的氣味。竟然有幾個村子，跑了個乾凈，靜靜的只抛下了一堆不能帶走的破屋。</p>
<p>當看剷報上登着「虎疫年」的消息的時候，一幅虎疫作祟的悲慘的畫面，一羣不得不迷信瘟神的農民們的誠摯的臉，一雙哀憐的眼睛，又淸淸楚楚的顯現在我的眼前來。</p>

<p>世間何物易動心。惟有黃金與美人。黃金可奪匹夫志。美人一語如綸音。你看那，多少靑年遭顚沛。亦爲黃金與美人。曾記得，楚霸王英雄烏江刎。他是，依依不捨虞美人。你看那，貪官汚吏爭權位。他是念念不休是黃金。有的是，爲黃金弟兄起爭執。有的是，爲黃金謀財害性命。有的是，爲黃金親愛變仇敵。有的是，爲黃金夫妻兩地分。有的是，爲黃金頃刻良心變。有的是，爲黃金失節又失身。黃金呀想你是，無上威嚴惡作祟。不知害了幾許人。我看你。顚倒黑白權力大。所以是，黃金可買美人心。試看那，自古美人多魔力。不但傾國又傾城。會記得　　笑緣中唐解元。脈脈含情爲美人。雙珠鳳中文必正。賣身投靠天官門。一樣秀才不去做。願</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the "Daiei Maru" incident, there has been another startling new development here recently. According to reports, if the Japanese authorities find that the Chinese Customs anti-smuggling ship did indeed engage in "illegal actions" against the Japanese ship "Daiei Maru" outside Qikou, they have decided to detain the anti-smuggling ship. This decision was made at a joint meeting of staff officers dispatched by the Lushun Naval Memorial Department, Consul-General Kubota of Tianjin, and resident Tianjin army and naval officers. The destroyer "Kiku," which the staff officer arrived in Tianjin on, has been ordered to sail to the Bohai Bay to monitor the anti-smuggling actions of Chinese Customs. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers are prominently reporting on the developments regarding the case of the Chinese Customs patrol boat firing on the Japanese ships "Daiei Maru" and "Ekimo Maru." Business circles and members of the House of Commons here are praising the actions of the patrol boat, believing that China's actions are entirely within its rights. They also say that Chinese Customs patrol boats never fire on ships without reason. The issue now depends on the extent of moral support that Britain and the United States give to China. A senior official, known to be friendly with Japan, told a Reuters reporter that Japan's permission to smuggle goods in a place where all rights clearly belong to China is unwise.

<h3 id="e8">Two Issues in the Economic World <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Looking at the recent domestic economic situation, there are two issues that are worth discussing. First, the trend of speculation has become increasingly rampant since funds lost their proper use. For example, the gold bids before the implementation of the legal tender, the bonds after the implementation, and the wild rise and fall of yarn, flowers, flour, and wheat after the bond consolidation have created huge waves, which can be said to be caused by the heat of speculation. However, from the perspective of the entire national economy and considering the future, we should know that China's current situation is definitely not one where speculation can be allowed to run rampant. Although speculation may be successful for a time, its momentum is difficult to sustain, and the influx of windfall profits only increases the habit of extravagance and destroys the foundation of the market. If speculators unfortunately fail, their businesses will follow suit. The reason why banks have gone bankrupt and liquidated in recent years is mostly due to this. These banks all abandoned the proper path and focused on the luck of obtaining large profits. Some of those in charge even took the profits for themselves and passed the failures on to the public. Once liquidation is announced, those who are dumbfounded and want to cry are the depositors who saved money by cutting back on food and clothing. Liquidation often takes years, and repayments are made in installments, which are like chicken feathers and dog scraps, to the point where people are unwilling to redeem the pledged items and distribute them to others. However, these banks, in peacetime, invariably use high interest rates, guaranteed certainty, and the joint and unlimited responsibility of directors and managers as their selling points. Afterwards, depositors are often unable to pursue responsibility, and directors and managers can even get away scot-free. The entire bad debt is passed on to the depositors. This phenomenon has a very bad impact on society and must be remedied urgently.</p>
<p>Second, the government has established strict laws and regulations to crack down on smuggling, and the business community has expressed its cooperation, so it should not be difficult to stop smuggled goods. However, due to the large profits involved, there are still many people engaged in it, and smuggled goods flow south in an endless stream. People often say that trade associations have failed to play a role in this matter. The reason is that each association does not have explicit provisions to force members of the same industry to join. Trade associations are established to protect the interests of businesses, and businesses should all be happy to join. Moreover, if the association is well-organized and handled properly, it may not be impossible for it to restrict non-members of the same industry as a legal entity. From this perspective, each trade association itself should strive to improve itself to gain the trust of the same industry. Otherwise, if members of the same industry are only superficially united, what good will it do to the association's business even if everyone joins?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interests of industry and commerce are not entirely the same and are sometimes conflicting. Therefore, it is indeed inconvenient to include industry and commerce in the same organization under certain circumstances. Moreover, according to the interpretation of the Regulations for the Registration of Agricultural, Industrial, and Mining Groups and Article 48 of the Civil Code, industrial operators can also establish their own organizations.</p>
<p>I believe that what is urgently needed today is not name but reality. If we can do things practically, then three people can be as good as five, and there will definitely be impressive results. Conversely, as Mencius said, "Laws alone cannot carry themselves into effect."</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Patriotic Comrades Associations of various counties and cities in Guangdong recently issued a letter to fellow countrymen, stating briefly that since September 18th, the enemy's hideous face has been revealed to us. The oppression of military force and economy has not ended, and it is followed by incitement and sowing discord, fostering domestic strife, and creating emerging warlords. At this critical time in North China, while the central government is busy dealing with it, a few generals in Guangdong and Guangxi, under the guise of resisting Japan and saving the country, are sending troops north, destroying peace and unity. Despite repeated admonishments from the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and criticisms from the public, they are still not aware of their mistakes. They continue to expand their military equipment under the name of resisting Japan, coerce the central government, and act as they please, thereby causing internal strife. They even want to plunge the 30 million people of Guangdong into an abyss of no return. In the past few years, the people of Guangdong have been completely devastated by the exploitation of excessive taxes and levies. If they are allowed to continue to secede, the people of Guangdong will inevitably become bandits. Fellow countrymen should unite as one, overthrow Chen, Li, and Bai, the emerging warlords who are harming the country and the people. To truly resist Japan and revive the nation, we must unite as one, obey the overall plan of the central government, and fight together under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the highest and only revolutionary leader in the country, in order to be successful. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee telegraphed Chen, Li, and Bai on the 29th, urging them not to take advantage of the country's crisis and aggravate the national disaster. They should restrain the people and respect the central government's orders, pull back from the brink, and immediately withdraw their troops to leave a glimmer of hope for the country and the nation. They said that success or failure depends on the thoughts of the gentlemen. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Five groups, including the Chengdu Municipal Trade Union, the Silk Industry Association, and the Coal Industry Association, telegraphed the central government on the 29th, requesting the suppression of the rebels, stating briefly that the warlords of Guangdong and Guangxi were colluding with the enemy, recruiting refugees, and recklessly using force. Their actions of betraying the party and the country are obvious and undeniable. If they are tolerated any longer, they will cause endless harm to the country. They requested the example of the suppression of the Fujian Incident to be used to eliminate them in one fell swoop in order to avoid affecting the overall situation and aggravating foreign troubles.

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave an impromptu speech on "Joint Struggle." The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech on "Joint Struggle" at the National Government's Memorial Week on the morning of the 29th. First, he explained in great detail the meaning of "Joint Struggle" in the Premier's will, saying that "Joint Struggle" was the highest principle guiding the Chinese revolution that the Premier had established through 40 years of experience leading the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution will succeed if it conforms to this principle, and it will fail if it violates it. Now that our country is encountering national difficulties, we must continue to work hard, so we must understand this principle more clearly. Second, he said that to achieve this joint struggle, all parties in the country must first be able to cooperate with each other. Cooperation has two meanings. On the negative side, it means being able to sacrifice some prejudices and treat each other sincerely. On the positive side, it means being able to discuss with each other and share responsibilities, building on mutual trust. If everyone can trust each other, then the practical effects of cooperation can be achieved. If everyone can cooperate, stand on the same front, and act in unison, then a great force can naturally be unleashed to cope with all events, and the country can turn from weak to strong and will not be bullied by others. Now that our country is encountering many difficulties, everyone should unite without hesitation, eliminate prejudices, and engage in joint struggle. This is the only way for our country to survive. Finally, he said that recently, a few comrades have inevitably misunderstood the central government's policies. In reality, he believes that the goals are the same, even if there are slight differences in the pace, they are not difficult to reconcile. Moreover, the Second Plenary Session will be held soon, and comrades from all sides can present their opinions for discussion at the conference. In short, in the current situation, only by uniting as one from top to bottom, following the teachings of the Premier, and jointly struggling can the country become strong. Otherwise, anything that can undermine this united front is extremely dangerous. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ding Weifen reported at the Central Memorial Week on the 29th. The original words meant: The explanation of one heart and one virtue is love and sincerity. People's hearts are all different. If you want them to take consistent steps, you only need to converge on "reason," and you can gather them into one heart. The so-called reason is reasonable thought. The standard of reasonable thought is the Three Principles of the People. People's thought of cherishing their own kind is nationalism, serving the country is democracy, and enjoying a stable life is the Principle of the People's Livelihood. If everyone uses the Three Principles of the People as a standard, they will naturally be of one heart and one virtue. In this way, helping and encouraging each other, naturally, there is love and sincerity, and the power that is generated will also be great. If so, one heart and one virtue, consistent from beginning to end, then there are no difficulties that the country cannot overcome. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">On the Eve of the League of Nations Assembly Meeting, Britain and France Reach a Compromise: Revoke Sanctions, Do Not Recognize the Annexation of Abyssinia, Decide Based on Argentina's Actions, Await Germany's Reply on the Locarno Pact, Seek to Enhance the Effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Blum, together with Foreign Minister Delbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden and Minister of Public Works, Lord Stanhope, had dinner last night at a restaurant near the new League of Nations headquarters, discussing the international situation. The guests and hosts were very amiable, and the meeting lasted until late at night. The two sides have reached a consensus on several issues, the most important of which are: France advocates that the League of Nations Covenant does not need to be revised, only annotations should be added so that no disagreement will arise during interpretation. This French interpretation proposal will be submitted to the Extraordinary Meeting of the League of Nations Assembly by Prime Minister Blum and discussed at the regular Assembly meeting in September. The agreements already reached between Britain and France at the Montreux Conference will be closely contacted by the representatives of the two countries attending the meeting (ie, Lord Stanhope and Peng Gu) to seek determination. Regarding the Rhine issue, it must be discussed in the long term after the Belgian Prime Minister Zhelan arrives in Geneva. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos had dinner with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Minister of Public Works, Lord Stanhope in Geneva last night, taking the opportunity to hold talks. Several compromises have been reached. According to the Paris Echo, the two sides agreed on the following five points: 1. The procedure for revoking sanctions; 2. Not recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, but it is not yet known whether this decision will be included in the draft resolution for the League of Nations Assembly to pass. The final method will depend on Argentina's actions, as the country is requesting the early convening of the Assembly; 3. Britain and France will not conduct general negotiations with Italy at this time to avoid stimulating the emotions of the delegations from various countries; 4. Regarding the Locarno case, both Britain and France believe that it is uncertain whether Italy will be able to participate in the meeting. Therefore, it is advocated that the signatory countries of the convention should only hold non-official meetings and wait for Germany to submit an answer to the British question before submitting the Rhine issue for discussion. At the same time, Britain should urge Germany to submit an answer as soon as possible; 5. Regarding the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant, both Britain and France believe that it is not the time to organize a committee to study this issue. Generally, Britain will eventually agree with France's views, that is, to add annotations to Article 16 of the Covenant (regarding sanctions) to enhance its effectiveness, without revising it.

<p>Geneva French Prime Minister Blum held talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning, which lasted a long time. Italian observer Shi Gaobo visited French Foreign Minister Delbos and informed him of the contents of the note that the Italian government plans to submit to the League of Nations Assembly tomorrow. According to Italian sources, this note is very short and not really in the form of a memorandum. Its content only explains the position taken by the Italian government and the conditions under which Italy will send personnel to participate in the various meetings of the League of Nations. Dr. Delbos also met with Chilean representative Rivaz and informed him that the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant should be left for discussion at the regular meeting of the League of Nations Assembly in September. Rivaz did not express any objection at that time. In addition, Delbos also met with Austrian representative Flugel. It is generally believed that Delbos had asked him to invite Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg to come to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Assembly. Judging from the current situation, when the League of Nations Assembly meets tomorrow, it is certain that the resolution on revoking the sanctions against Italy will be passed, without any doubt. However, it seems that there is still no guarantee that Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will be recognized by various countries. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Assembly meets tomorrow, it is heard that someone will propose a draft resolution to reiterate that all cases of conquest of other countries' territories are incompatible with the basic principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, but no further measures will be taken to deal with Italy. The British and French governments have no intention of negotiating with Italian Mussolini at this time. As for the issue of German rearmament and disarmament, the countries concerned will take important decisions, that is, the four signatory countries of the Locarno Pact (Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium) will decide on the date of the meeting to discuss the impact caused by the entry of German troops into the Rhineland region, and from this time until that time, the British government will urge Germany to submit an answer to the British question as soon as possible.

As for the issue of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, the Belgian authorities advocate that the League of Nations Assembly should organize a special committee to study it and postpone it until the regular meeting in September before submitting it for discussion.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting tomorrow to discuss the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. The Emperor of Abyssinia declared to those around him this afternoon that if the League of Nations cannot provide immediate material assistance, he will return to his country with his ministers to form an army to resist the Italian army and return to his country via British-Egyptian Sudan. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, it was learned that Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia is now planning to return to his country after the League of Nations Assembly adjourns, planning to continue resisting Italian military affairs. Well-informed observers claimed that the Emperor of Abyssinia will personally appeal to the Assembly for Abyssinia and will request financial assistance from it to resist the Italian army. If the Assembly does not want to stay in Europe together, the Emperor of Abyssinia plans to return to his country via British-Egyptian Sudan. The Emperor of Abyssinia believes that if he does not prove that there is still a part of Abyssinia resisting the Italian army, Abyssinia will be completely destroyed. He also stated that he will organize a government in Gore, but the area is very close to the Abyssinian capital. It only takes a few hours by plane to go back and forth, so it is easily targeted by Italian air force bombing. It is rumored that the Emperor of Abyssinia has notified British Foreign Secretary Eden of this intention, and Eden has expressed his agreement, because Britain will then be able to allow Abyssinia to transport munitions through Sudan. According to Prime Minister Baldwin, he also expressed his approval, but General McConnan has recently not reported that the Emperor of Abyssinia has ordered him to organize the people of western Abyssinia to resist the Italian army.

He also said, "Those who advocate the revocation of sanctions are cowardly and incompetent people who have neither a firm will nor the courage to overcome all difficulties. The peace organization has been destroyed. The recent accident is clear evidence of this. The cause of world peace has suffered a fatal blow. Even if we want to save it, we are at the end of our rope, and our country's reputation has been stained. The phenomenon is so painful." (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Starting from July 3, the cabinet will decide in the cabinet meeting on more than 30 fundamental national policies based on the new policy of the current cabinet's general administration. Director-General of the Investigation Bureau Yoshida, Chief Secretary Fujinuma, and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Tsuda have been carefully discussing which principles should be adopted as appropriate and important national policies. As a result, the policy was determined to resolutely reject the cabinet members' separate doctrine and adopt a national policy centered on national defense. After consulting with Prime Minister Hirota and Finance Minister Baba to implement the review, the following seven items were limited as fundamental national policies:</p>
<p>Strengthen the overall national defense capabilities; Nationalization of electricity; National fuel policy (coal liquefaction); Agricultural insurance; Increase in taxes and tax increase policies; Aviation national policy (increase aircraft production capacity); National health policy;</p>
<p>The government has decided to hold temporary cabinet meetings every day starting from July 3 to deliberate these important national policies. At the same time, it will submit its required budget for substantial discussion and then transfer it to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. (29th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the national policy cabinet meeting in early July, the army authorities listened to the reports of various provinces on the content of the national policy. The Ministry of the Army plans not to submit a specific plan, but it has decided on the following principles for various national policies, namely: 1. The national policy must take into account the current objective situation in the country and be most suitable for correcting current abuses; 2. The full implementation of the above national policies may cause financial difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the degree of urgency. As for enriching the armaments stationed in Manchukuo, preparing aviation and air defense equipment and facilities, and strengthening mechanized troops, each plan is decided independently by the military. Therefore, the national policies that require the cabinet to implement should be closely related to these plans, namely: Unifying civilian aviation; Establishing a national hot fuel policy; Controlling the capacity of military industrial industries and seeking their development; Establishing necessary facilities for national health and fitness; Rural revival and relief policies; The development of small and medium-sized industries. (29th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The draft budget revenue plan for next year can generally be decided before July 10. As for the expenditure budget, the Ministry of the Army requires 700 million yen, and the Ministry of the Navy requires 650 million yen. Military expenditures have reached 1.35 billion yen. The Guangtian Cabinet's new administrative policies in the fields of literature and governance, the stability of national life, and the policy of both soldiers and farmers have expenses of no less than 350 million yen. Therefore, the total budget for next year may exceed 2.6 billion yen or reach a huge number of 2.7 billion yen. (29th Allied Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Harbin News reported on the remarks of Makiyama, the head of the Japanese delegation to Hungary. Pravda published an article on this, as follows: "The Harbin Changbai Mountain [location] and the Tokyo Japanese government agencies have not denied these remarks to date, so these remarks can be considered confirmed. The Soviet Union consistently adheres to a policy of peace, which is well known. The provocative actions of the Japanese militarists and the Japanese government's refusal to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union have recently forced our government to take necessary measures to protect the Soviet Union's Far Eastern borders."</p>
<p>"Makiyama's demand that the Soviet government withdraw its Far Eastern Red Army is a direct provocation. Based on this demand, Makiyama openly threatened the Soviet Union with war. To this day, it is recognized that the Japanese military has always held the most rude position in its relations with the Soviet Union. But Makiyama's remarks show that not only do the militarists themselves make arrogant demands, but they also allow their civilian agents to act freely. Japanese parliamentarians, seeking favor with the militarists, clearly went to Europe with a certain purpose. Makiyama himself admitted that they were maliciously talking about Sun Island to countries that maintain normal diplomatic relations with Japan, encouraged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and provided with false information. Makiyama's purpose in going to Europe is clearly to defend the invasion plans of the Japanese aggressors and to seek allied countries.

<p>Roubaix, France The orthodox Socialist Party branch recently held a grand demonstration here to celebrate the victory of the left-wing People's Front. Interior Minister Salengro, Labor Minister Le Baste, and many other government officials attended. Red flags were hung everywhere in the auditorium of the City Hall. More than a thousand Socialist fighters gathered in the hall, raised their fists, and sang the Internationale to welcome the cabinet members. Salengro delivered a speech, saying, "Some cabinets often generously offer promises when they are running for election, which are very pleasant to listen to, but after they are in power, they put their previous words behind them. This is not the case with us. Our party platform will never be regarded as waste paper, and being trustworthy is our specialty. We have now decided to avoid inciting the masses, so as not to do anything to cause trouble, but also not to deceive the people and put the hopes of millions of people into the water at once. In short, whether in the government, in the parliament, or in the country, we must always be united to implement the political program jointly drawn up by the parties of the left-wing People's Front." The Minister of the Interior then criticized the tricks used by speculators, saying that these people want to raise prices to make private profits, and we know that there are several groups that are inciting and directing from it. The government will now punish these unscrupulous merchants with strict laws. If there are still legal loopholes for violating the prohibition, we will transfer all the files to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Then he talked about the strike wave, saying that the working class has now won a victory, so don't overdo it, so that the victory will have flaws. As for the semi-military organizations, the government has already promulgated a law to order their dissolution.

<p>Saint-Denis, France The mayor and member of parliament of this city, Doriot, was originally one of the leaders of the French Communist Party. He broke away from the Communist Party and formed his own faction because he opposed the Third International's intervention in French internal affairs. Recently, the "French People's Party" has been established. Recently, in front of representatives from various provinces and the majority of citizens, he explained the purpose of the new political party, which is to unite the agricultural and industrial sectors and the middle class, so that they will not be controlled by foreign countries, and especially to break away from the constraints of the Third International. As for its political program, the main points are as follows: (1) To reform the constitutional government based on republicanism; (2) The administrative power must be stable and lasting, so that it can adhere to a firm policy, preside over national politics, and fulfill the role of arbitrator in various disputes on social issues; (3) To establish various economic conferences based on occupational representation, so that national and regional plans can be formulated on a regular basis, and the production and consumption status of agriculture, industry, and commerce can be balanced.

<p>Nice, France The employees of various hotels in Nice and Cannes had made various demands to the employers. The employers believed that they could not accept them, and immediately announced a shutdown and expelled the employees as a countermeasure. After hearing the news, the hotel owners along the Côte d'Azur held a meeting last night and decided to close their businesses uniformly in order to show their support, and posted notices in front of various hotels, explaining that if the most demanding requirements of the employees were met, it would inevitably increase the burden, and the employers were unable to cope, so they had to announce the closure. At the same time, they notified the tourists that they could still stay in the hotels, but they hoped to be forgiven for the inadequate hospitality. The Côte d'Azur is a summer resort in southern France. At this time of the hot summer, tourists gather, and labor-capital disputes occur in the hotel industry, which is also a great disappointment.

<p>Philadelphia President Roosevelt is now preparing to engage in an election campaign, and "Democracy and Opportunity" is his rallying cry for the struggle. The public initially feared that this campaign would spare no effort to attack individuals, but when President Roosevelt accepted the nomination as the next presidential candidate yesterday, he did not denigrate individuals, so this panic has been dispelled. President Roosevelt's remarks criticizing "economic royalists" yesterday were very popular. Although the Republican Party praised President Roosevelt's speech, their comments focused on the point of repeatedly requesting Lehman to accept the post of Governor of New York State for the third time. The New York Times reported that this move dispelled Postmaster General Farley, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention, who said that "the election is now in the bag," and confirmed that Roosevelt's name has lost its mystique in his home state, and someone else must now be used to win the victory that President Roosevelt cannot win.

People believed that he had scaled the wall and escaped while walking in the hospital square. On the day Mr. Zioncheck went mad, his wife fled from her residence. The next morning, Mr. Zioncheck, wearing a sweaty shirt, drove a car and drove madly to the White House, ignoring the traffic lights on the road, seeking to see President Roosevelt and requesting that the army be mobilized to carry machine guns to bombard a certain hotel where he believed his new wife was hiding. The doorman told him that the President was out on official business. Mr. Zioncheck then took out a black suitcase and gave it to the doorman, saying that there were some small gifts to give to the President. The doorman accepted it and exchanged it, and it made a clanging sound, so he returned it to Mr. Zioncheck. Mr. Zioncheck said, "Don't be afraid, this is not a bomb. Open it when you are free and two empty beer bottles and an empty ping pong ball box will roll out." He added, "This is for the President and his secretary." Then he jumped into the car and drove madly away, saying before leaving that he would sue Vice President Garner for conspiring to hide his wife.

<p>(Beiping) The trial for the murder of Japanese soldier Sasaki, which opened last week at the British Military Provisional Court, has not yielded results. The court continued its trial this morning, with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean witnesses all present. The trial is presided over by British Consul in Beiping, P.C. O'Riordan, and others. Still, no results have been obtained. The court will continue its investigation tomorrow. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British Consulate court, which is thoroughly investigating the Japanese authorities' accusation that two guards from the British Embassy beat Sasaki to death, continued its hearing this morning. Due to the lateness of a Japanese witness and the absence of another, the proceedings were delayed. After waiting patiently for fifty minutes, a Korean cook from a certain wine shop finally testified. He claimed that on the night of May 26th, two British soldiers wearing yellow uniforms, armbands, and white belts entered the wine shop where he worked. There were seven Korean customers present at the time. One of them stood in the middle of the room, and the two soldiers immediately punched him. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely from the face. A Chinese waiter came out to mediate but was also beaten. This unfortunate incident occurred after midnight. The British soldiers left almost immediately after the incident. Under cross-examination by a lawyer, the witness further stated that he could still remember the date of the incident as May 26th, but he did not know what day of the week it was. Later, when the British soldiers were lined up at the British Embassy for identification, he was also present but could not recognize the assailants from that day. The witness also stated that they had not provoked the British soldiers at the time. After giving his testimony, the court announced a five-minute recess to allow another witness to arrive, but British Consul Fitzmaurice waited for half an hour without anyone appearing, so he adjourned the court for lunch. When the court resumed in the afternoon, Dr. Imamura, the director of Beiping Kawada Hospital, testified that Sasaki was brought to the hospital at 12:30 AM. He could not remember the date. He did not know Sasaki, but people told him who it was. The person was already dead. His right eye was ruptured, likely from being struck by a heavy object with a soft surface, probably an "American club" wrapped in soft leather and filled with lead, rather than a bare fist. The person died from internal bleeding, with a fracture on the forehead located at the base of the brain behind the nose. The person's body remained in the hospital until the next day. The witness stated that he was also present at the autopsy. He added that he had not seen the body since it left the hospital. In response to the lawyer's questions, he said that Sasaki was wearing a Japanese military officer's uniform. The lawyer asked if a fall could have caused Sasaki's bone fracture. Imamura replied that, based on the external injuries, it was not caused by a fall. After further questioning by the lawyer, the next witness called was Kobe, a friend of Sasaki's who ran a store not far from where Sasaki was killed on Hada Gate Street. According to his testimony, at midnight on the 26th, he went to buy long-distance bus tickets to Rehe for Sasaki and his friend for the next day. He then went to the hotel to tell them, but they had already left. When he returned to the store, he met them on the way and told them that the tickets had been purchased. This was between 12:10 AM and 12:20 AM. While he was talking to the two men, he saw two soldiers coming from the west side of Hada Gate Street, heading north. They were wearing yellow uniforms and were British soldiers. He had lived in Beiping for ten years, so he knew they were British soldiers based on their uniforms. He saw the two soldiers light cigarettes and walk past them. He then said goodbye to Sasaki and his friend. After turning away, he heard a shout, which he believed was in English, and saw several rickshaw pullers running away. He then saw one soldier chasing someone north and did not see him again. The second soldier crossed the street to another person and appeared to strike him, but he could not see clearly because he was watching the one being chased. He saw the first soldier fall to the ground and immediately turned back to go home, thinking it was just a common street fight. When he saw the second soldier strike someone, he did not see him holding anything. When he arrived at the store, it was past 12:30 AM. Soon after, the doorbell rang. He opened the door and saw Sasaki's friend standing outside, with Sasaki on a rickshaw, groaning. He advised them to take him to the hospital immediately and telephoned the Japanese consulate police. He also went to the hospital and learned that Sasaki died shortly after arriving. When he met Sasaki and his friend, he did not see them carrying any weapons. The case was adjourned for continuation tomorrow. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the murder of Sasaki, an official of the Manchukuo Ministry of Military Affairs, according to a telegram from First Secretary Mutō in Beiping to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 29th, the British consular trial began in Beiping on the 24th. It is composed of the presiding judge, British Vice-Consul Morris, prosecutor, British High Court Prosecutor Wade, and the lawyer for the British soldier suspect, Lawyer Kent. Japanese Secretary Okumura attended as an observer and ensured that Japanese witnesses were present and cooperative. However, due to some regrettable aspects of the prosecutor's handling of the trial in court, the Japanese Embassy Office in Beiping ordered Secretary Mutō on the 26th to visit British Embassy Secretary Coates and lodge a serious protest in writing, demanding a fair trial.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a spokesperson for a certain government agency, after two years of negotiations, China and Germany have agreed on a method for exchanging goods. China will export raw materials to Germany, and Germany will import manufactured machinery to China to help China build its industries. The total amount of the exchange is difficult to determine because the quantity of goods imported from Germany will depend on the amount of raw materials China can supply. The intention of this method is purely for both countries to use their respective strengths in production or manufacturing to help the other overcome their deficiencies. It is entirely a form of trade, and many outside rumors are inconsistent with the facts. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Serious Defense in Guangdong and Guangxi: Actively Expanding Military Strength. Guangxi Adds Three Divisions, Guangdong Establishes 4th and 5th Armies. Generals of the 19th Route Army are Active in Guangxi and Guangdong. <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The situation in the Southwest is still not optimistic. The situation on the borders of Guangxi and Hunan and on the borders of Fujian and Guangdong is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, at present, the Guangxi army is unusually busy with military deployments from Quanzhou to Longhuguan. They have been stockpiling military rations for days and purchasing military supplies and kerosene and electric oil worth over one million yuan from a certain place. The Guangxi army in Quanzhou is now commanded by Xia Weiyi, the commander of the 15th Army, as the forward commander. Wang Zanbin has been promoted to army commander and commands three elite divisions that can be deployed at any time. The 7th Army under Liao Lei is deployed on the Guangxi-Guizhou border. The regular Guangxi army has only five or six divisions, which is insufficient. Therefore, generals of the former 19th Route Army have recently been employed to organize anti-Japanese national salvation armies in Guangxi. It is heard that the newly formed division established by Weng Zhaoyuan in Guangxi has been established. In addition, two former division commanders of the 19th Route Army have also each organized a division, for a total of three newly formed divisions. The soldiers are all from the Guangxi provincial militia, who have received considerable training, so the anti-Japanese national salvation army is progressing very smoothly. As for Guangdong Province, the defense arrangements for the northeast river defenses are even more serious. The Second Army, which departed for Chenzhou some time ago, returned to the Guangdong border. The Fourth Division is stationed at Pingshi Lechang, the Fifth Division is deployed in Renhua, and the Sixth Division is distributed in Jiufeng, forming a parallel line, and contacting the First Division of the First Army in Nanxiong. The Chen regiment of the Second Division stationed in Ganzhou has returned to Dayu to support the various units of the Second Division in Xinfeng. The Third Division returns to Sannan, and the Seventh Division of the Third Army in Dongjiang defends Xunwu. From Xunwu to Jiaoling and Pingyuan, the Independent First Division chooses key points to garrison. The Ninth Division stationed in Chaoan has recently moved to Xingning and Dabu, and various regiments of the Guards Brigade are firmly defending the northeastern border. In order to expand military strength, the Independent First Division will be expanded into the Fourth Army. The original First and Second Brigades of the Independent First Division will be expanded into divisions, with Huang Renhuan as the commander of the Fourth Army, Zeng Youren as the commander of the Tenth Division, and Yan Yingyu as the commander of the Eleventh Division. The four regiments of the original Training Division and the Independent Second Brigade will be merged into the Fifth Army, with Miao Peinan as the commander of the Fifth Army, Tan Sui as the commander of the Thirteenth Division, and Chen Zhang as the commander of the Fourteenth Division. The above two armies are expected to be formally formed and deployed around July 1. In addition, a First Independent Brigade has recently been formed, which is reorganized from various specialized units, with Kong Kequan as the commander of the First Independent Brigade. Guangdong's military strength has increased so dramatically that it is rumored that several divisions will be transferred to the north in the future. Since the Southwest has raised the banner of the Anti-Japanese Army, it has recruited all the generals of the 19th Route Army who fought against Japan in the past. In addition to Weng Zhaoyuan and others who are active in Guangxi, Chief Commander of the former 19th Route Army Jiang Guangnai responded to the call of the authorities and arrived in Guangzhou on the 26th. He immediately discussed major plans with Li Zongren and Chen Jitang. It is heard that Jiang will assume important tasks. After Jiang stays in Guangdong for a few days to discuss matters thoroughly, he will go to Nanning to discuss important public affairs with Bai Chongxi. (June 27)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Remnant Bandits Stir Up Trouble in Northeastern Fujian; Rampant in Luoyuan and Lianjiang Counties <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After rigorous suppression by stationed troops, remnant bandits in the counties of Chong'an, Pucheng, Jian'ou in northern Fujian and Lianjiang, Luoyuan, and Ningde in eastern Fujian had been gradually subdued. Recently, they have seized the opportunity to stir up trouble again. In northern Fujian, the band led by Huang Ligui, which had previously suffered repeated defeats by various armies and fled into Jiangxi province, has now been attacked by Jiangxi troops and is fleeing back into Fujian in an attempt to survive. A remnant force of over 300 bandits recently fled from Xiangdun to the Guangze Yangshang border, intending to join forces with the remnant bandits of Shilong, attempting to invade Chong'an and Pucheng. The troops stationed there have intensified their joint efforts to encircle the main bandit force on Yangshang. Furthermore, bandits from Shunchang, previously incited by Huang Ligui, gathered and hid in remote villages, engaging in arson and looting. Although the stationed troops had sent forces to suppress them, they have not been completely eradicated. Recently, these bandits, believing there was an opportunity to exploit, even attacked Guixi Yangdun, looting and kidnapping seven men and women. The bandit forces are quite rampant, and people from various villages are fleeing to the county seat for safety. Among them, the refugees from Guixi, Yangdun, and Renshou are particularly numerous, with a total of about 1,900 elderly, young, men, and women following the troops, temporarily retreating from Shakou to Renshou. The bandits attacked and occupied Renshou, burned down the local government office and the house of district chief Wu Shaoyi, and looted every household, creating a tragic scene. Now, Shunchang county seat is overcrowded with fleeing residents, leading to a shortage of food. The people of Shunchang have separately requested the inspection army and the provincial authorities to quickly suppress the bandits and relieve the people's suffering. The inspection army has already entered Yangkou. The number of bandits is limited and should not be difficult to annihilate. However, the losses in the three villages of Renshou, Guiyang, etc., have been significant. In eastern Fujian, the banditry in Pingnan has been rampant for the past two months. The other night, another 40 to 50 bandits advanced from the north gate area towards the northeastern rear mountains. After being discovered by the soldiers guarding the city, they immediately opened fire. The bandits then occupied the high ground in the rear mountains and returned fire. Inside the city, apart from a platoon of the security regiment, there were only a dozen or so police officers from the county government. The county magistrate then gathered over a hundred members of the militia, armed with over fifty guns, to defend the city and engage the bandits in a firefight, holding out until dawn, when the bandits began to retreat to the northeast. Currently, representatives from various public and legal organizations in the county, along with district chiefs, have decided to organize a joint anti-bandit volunteer team from eight districts. Each district will contribute twelve men, divided into two squads. In addition to thirty rifles borrowed by the county government from the provincial security bureau, the remaining weapons will be drawn from each district. The anti-bandit operation will last for three months. The minimum sustenance for the volunteer soldiers will be borne by wealthy households throughout the county. Furthermore, in the counties of Luoyuan, Lianjiang, Gutian, and Minhou, small numbers of remnant communists have been joining forces with scattered bandits in recent days, causing significant disturbances. Although local security teams and militias have been blocking them, they are difficult to suppress as they flee in one direction only to reappear in another. Among them, the losses in Luoyuan and Lianjiang counties have been particularly heavy. On the thirteenth of this month, over a hundred local communists with eighty firearms were discovered in Zhongfang Township, Fifth District, Luoyuan County. They fled from Zhengjiayang Shanglou in Ningde, aiming to promote communism, kill chiefs of the Baojia system, and kidnap people for ransom. Most of the shops owned by the Bao chiefs were burned down. On the fourteenth, they fled into Yangtou Keng, Fourth District, and sent plainclothes bandits to arrest and kill Ruan Renzhen, the former commander of a self-reformed communist guerrilla unit. On the fifteenth, the bandits fled to Wayaoban Township. The villagers, along with over twenty members of the Big Knife Society, resisted, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours. Over a dozen bandits were killed, but due to being outnumbered, five villagers were killed and two were injured. All houses in the township, totaling over a hundred households, were burned down. On the sixteenth, the bandits fled into Pubian. The county security team, led by squad leader Li, along with district chief Li of the Third District, led the militia in an ambush. County magistrate Zhang Guojian of Lianjiang personally led the security team to Pubian to assist in the suppression. The bandits occupied the high mountains and blockhouses, firing and resisting stubbornly. After a fierce battle for two hours, the bandits could not be attacked because the bridge had been destroyed. On the seventeenth, part of the bandits fled into Lanshui, and another part fled into Jianghou. On the eighteenth, they extensively looted residents' property in Yu Kou. On the nineteenth night, they fled to Liyang, and on the twentieth, they fled towards Shangling in Luoyuan Township. On the twenty-first, they fled into Shenkeng and Shekeng. On the morning of the twenty-second, they fled into Heyang. The son of the chief of the forty-eighth Bao of the area was arrested. In the afternoon, they fled to Hongyang, 25 miles away from the county seat. Currently, the banditry is very rampant. With the early rice harvest approaching, farmers cannot work in the fields, transportation is disrupted, and all industries are at a standstill. The losses throughout the county are incalculable. Yesterday, a unit dispatched by the Marine Corps was ordered to transfer to Luoyuan to suppress the bandits as soon as possible. (June 27)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Jiangxi Province Baojia Expenses Collected as Surcharges on Land Tax and Business Tax; Baojia Chiefs Can Be Prevented from Extorting and Levying Excessive Taxes, Reducing Farmers' Suffering Annually <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Baojia expenses in Jiangxi have traditionally been apportioned among households, with each household divided into four categories (A, B, C, and D) based on their wealth and collected monthly. Temporary levies such as those for blockhouses, roads, telephones, Baojia schools, conscripted labor, joint bandit suppression, and even joint security expenses are all based on the Baojia system. The apportionment methods and amounts not only differ from county to county but also vary from Jia to Jia. Taking the commonly known model county of Linchuan as an example, each able-bodied man in a household, in addition to paying the prescribed Baojia fee of over one yuan annually, faces temporary levies estimated at about two yuan. Annual conscripted labor, in addition to the prescribed service, along with temporary local mobilizations, totals over twenty days. At a minimum wage of twenty cents per day and estimated oil, salt, firewood, rice, and miscellaneous expenses of about fourteen or fifteen cents per day for each day of service, twenty days amounts to over seven yuan. Each person needs to bear ten yuan annually. However, the annual net income of even the strongest farmer is less than forty or fifty yuan, and various levies consume one-fourth or one-fifth of it. In other words, each person, in addition to their own living expenses and the burdens of the elderly and weak in their family, faces an additional pressure of one-fourth. Given the current natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the bankrupt rural economy, how can they endure it? The objective of Baojia in Jiangxi lies in the four characters of governance, education, nurturing, and defense. The character of governance has been fully implemented. Farmers, even without food for the next day, dare not owe a single penny of Baojia fees. Even carrying bran and husks as provisions for their labor service, they dare not hide and avoid their duties. The government believes that only in this way can it exert its political power. However, farmers who are bled dry and whose marrow is exhausted are about to collapse on the road, like Zhiyuan's exhausted horse. In order to improve Baojia expenses and alleviate farmers' suffering, the provincial government specially resolved at yesterday's provincial affairs meeting that Baojia expenses for the 25th year will be collected as a 20% surcharge on land tax, butchery tax, and ordinary business tax. This will be collected and disbursed by the provincial treasury. From the first of July, the collection of Baojia household fees will be suspended, and no Baojia expenses of any kind may be collected thereafter. This has been telegraphed to all commissioners and county and city governments today for compliance. After this law is implemented, farmers' suffering can be greatly reduced. Expenses will be collected through surcharges on business, butchery, and land taxes, without placing the entire burden on poor farmers. Merchants and landlords, who have a better life than farmers, can share the burden equally. Centralized collection and disbursement will reduce collection expenses. Baojia chiefs will not be able to act arbitrarily. Impoverished areas can be compensated by wealthier areas. The procedure will be simplified, eliminating the need for Baojia chiefs to constantly demand and harass people. However, Baojia malpractices will remain as in the past. For matters not regulated or mandated by superiors, Baojia chiefs can still invent various pretexts and tricks to extort money. Receiving a collection order is like receiving a sacred decree. Superiors take one, and subordinates extract many times more. Therefore, the authorities should pay close attention and prevent Baojia chiefs from arbitrarily turning things upside down and causing misery to our people. (June 25)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Guangdong Silk Industry Gradually Shows Signs of Recovery; Prices of Yarn and Silk are More Expensive Than Last Year; Exports of Raw Silk Have Also Increased <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The silk industry in Guangdong Province has recently shown signs of recovery. Silkworm farmers are actively cultivating mulberry fields, and silk factories are resuming operations one after another. Unemployed silk reeling workers are no longer forced to wander to other places. According to old farmers in Shunde, a major silk-producing area, the slump in Guangdong silk was most severe last year. Mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms fell in price to two or three dimes per hundred catties, and no one cared. Silkworm cocoons were only worth four yuan per ten thousand shells, and mulberry seedlings were only one yuan thirty or forty cents per ten thousand plants. Whether they planted mulberries or produced silkworm eggs, they went bankrupt due to low prices. They sold their children and daughters, and moved and wandered. Almost half of the silkworm farmers in Shunde fled. This year, overseas buyers of raw silk from Guangdong Province have gradually returned to their old ways, and silk prices have risen accordingly. The withered mulberry and silkworm industry in Shunde and Nanhai has recovered. It has been found that the price of mulberry has rebounded to thirteen or fourteen yuan per hundred catties this year. Those who converted mulberry fields to grow miscellaneous grains last year have resumed planting mulberries this year. The price of silkworm cocoons has also risen accordingly, with each ten thousand shells worth over nine yuan. Dozens of silk weaving factories in Shunde and Nanhai have resumed operations. Raw silk is in high demand both domestically and internationally. As of yesterday, the price of silk from Nanhai Jiujiang was over one thousand yuan per hundred catties, and the next best was also worth over nine hundred yuan. Since resuming operations, silk products woven by yarn and silk factories have also improved. Even undyed plain silk has now risen in price to sixteen or seventeen yuan per bolt (about four or five Zhang) (it was only worth seven yuan last year), but sales are still very smooth. Many weavers are working overtime. As for the foreign sales of raw silk, in addition to exports to the United States and France, India has also purchased a lot. According to a recent survey, from May 1st to June 15th of this year, Guangzhou transported 800 catties of raw silk to the United States, 20,000 catties to various European countries, and 179,680 catties to Asia and India, totaling 219,360 catties, an increase of 68,000 catties compared to the same period last year.

<h3 id="e88">Shops in Jiangzhuang Town, Songjiang, Robbed <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>This is not the first time that Jiangzhuang Town in southern Pudong has been robbed. The shops are bearing the brunt of the suffering and are always vigilant. At around 11 PM the night before last, the pharmacy opened by Zhu Ziqin of No. 1 household in the seventh Jia of the second Bao of the town was suddenly broken into by six robbers speaking with a Hakka accent. Two robbers stood guard, each carrying a handgun, flashlight, and dagger as weapons. They searched and looted for about half an hour, taking a gold ring weighing five Fen, twenty-nine thousand copper coins, over fifty Jiao in paper money, six pieces of clothing, and a suitcase. Zhu Ziqin's grandson, Liangjie, suffered a knife wound to his left hand, bleeding profusely. The robbers then fled south with their loot, leaving behind a dagger. The victim has reported the incident to the Ninth Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Commissioner's Office Changes District Names <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government believes that the Commissioner's Offices in various places have always used the name of the county where they are stationed as the name of the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of a certain district, while the Security Commander of the district concurrently held is named with a number, which is not uniform, and documents are very inconvenient. It has been proposed to change the Commissioner's Office based on the number of the Security Commander concurrently held. The proposal was approved by the Executive Yuan and forwarded for compliance. The Security Commander of this district is the Third District, which will be corrected to the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office of the Third District. Commissioner Wang, after receiving the order, has decided to make the correction from July 1st and has instructed all counties to take note.</p>

<p>Zhou Yulin, Chief of the Liyang County Business Tax Bureau, privately connected electric lights in the Liyang Tax Bureau in January of last year and stole electricity. He was caught by the Zhenheng Electric Light Factory of the county, which sent personnel to join the Chief of the First Police Station in the public security department for investigation. The factory then filed a lawsuit against Zhou Yulin for theft with the Liyang County Government, which also handled judicial matters. After trial by the county magistrate Chen Fu, the defendant was acquitted due to insufficient evidence of guilt. The factory was not satisfied and appealed to the local District Court. The court rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment. The factory was still unwilling to accept the judgment and continued to appeal to the High Court. After reviewing the case, the High Court considered the appeal to be justified and sent it back to the local court for retrial. After several trials by Judge Liu, the judgment was announced yesterday: Zhou Yulin, with the intention of unlawful gain, stole the property of others and was fined fifty yuan. If he is unable to pay after forced execution, he will serve one day of labor for every two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Stolen Coal Shipped to Chengjiang and Unloaded Secretly <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The thirteen ships of stolen coal from Liujiang were shipped to Wuxi, but due to accusations and sanctions from all sides, they could not be unloaded, as detailed in previous reports. The stolen coal was recently shipped to Jiangyin. According to news from Jiangyin, someone witnessed that the coal was not shipped to Shanghai. After the ships entered the Yingtian River at the south gate, the coal boss directed the unloading of the coal at night. However, where the coal was unloaded is still unknown. The reason why the smugglers claimed that they had shipped the stolen coal to Shanghai was to avoid the attention of the people of Wuxi and Jiangyin.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Preventing Tea Levies in Rural Areas <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Tea House Trade Association of this city reported that members in rural areas have reported that recently, individuals posing as officials of micro-tax collection agencies have been surveying tea counters in various shops and collecting tea house levies. They have requested relief. It was pointed out that the county's budget for the 25th year has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee, and the tea house levies have been reduced by 186 yuan compared to last year. How can these officials start collecting levies in rural areas where they have never been collected before? This is clearly exceeding the budget and collecting taxes outside the law, violating the orders of the Ministry and the Province. Therefore, the sixteenth executive committee meeting was convened yesterday and resolved not to assume the obligation of paying taxes and to petition the relevant ministries and departments of the Central Government and the Provincial Government to quickly stop this practice and punish them according to law. As for the tea house management licenses, which are due for renewal, they should be collected and transferred to the respective branch bureau chiefs for renewal according to the practice of last year.</p>

The customer was startled and jumped up, running out the door. The shop assistant, Ah Ti, was sucked in by the electricity, his legs flailing wildly, suffering severe burns. On the same day (28th), Shi Guohou, a 20-year-old apprentice carpenter at the East Gate Kou Lime Wood Shop, was tricked by someone who told him to climb to the top of the electric pole on the city wall. Shi Jia showed off his bravery, climbed up like a monkey, and when he was about to reach the top of the pole, he grabbed a bare electric wire for assistance. As soon as he made contact, sparks burst out, and he lost control, falling from the top of the pole onto the city wall and then rolling from the city wall to the ground. When he fell from the pole, his body was parallel to the electric pole. The middle of the pole was nailed with sharp nails, causing deep nail wounds to his neck and abdomen. Blood gushed out like a spring. His brother rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and hired someone to carry him quickly to the hospital. The hospital refused to accept him because his teeth had fallen out and his brain had cracked. He was carried back and died immediately.</p>

<p>Ambassador Noulens shook hands with each of the welcoming personnel to express his gratitude. At 9 a.m., he boarded a special reception boat and went directly to the Bund Wharf on French Avenue to disembark. At that time, a part of the Chinese and French welcoming personnel had already been waiting at the wharf. The French side specially dispatched French troops stationed in Shanghai and armed French and Annamese police, leading a tank convoy, a motorcycle convoy, and a military band, to form a line from the Bund on French Avenue to the Bund on Avenue Edward VII. The traffic on that section of the road was completely cut off from dawn until 9:30 a.m., and pedestrians had to take a detour. After Ambassador Noulens disembarked, the military band played the French national anthem and held a military review ceremony, and then he returned to the French Consulate General to rest. Full photo of the French Ambassador with welcomers (International News Agency report).</p>
<p>Statement from Havas News Agency, Shanghai: After disembarking, Ambassador Noulens went to the consulate to attend a reception and delivered a brief speech, saying that he was very happy to be appointed as ambassador and come to the new China, to be able to reunite with old friends and make new ones. He said that he had already gained a understanding of China during his tenure as consul in Kunming and consul general in Shanghai. This time he will work with the same enthusiasm with the Chinese government and French people to further strengthen the friendship between China and France, and will also sincerely cooperate with people from all countries. Ambassador Noulens may go to Nanjing next month on the 4th to meet with Chairman Lin of the National Government to present his credentials.</p>
<p>Brief Biography</p>
<p>Ambassador Noulens is of medium height and full of energy. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was wearing a gray-black suit, rimless glasses, and black leather shoes. His attitude was very amiable. Ambassador Noulens is a bachelor, so he did not bring a wife or entourage with him. He is 52 years old and started in the diplomatic service in 1908. He first came to China in 1912 as a consul in Shanghai, and then served as acting consul general. Later, he resigned and returned to China. In 1927, he came to China again as consul general in Shanghai. Two years later, he was transferred back to China and served as an assistant in the Marine Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then promoted to Director of the Oriental Department. Later, he served as Minister to Yugoslavia, and then transferred to Minister to Czechoslovakia. Just when the Sino-French envoys were being upgraded, the former Minister to China, Mr. Zhang Lideng, died in Beijing. Therefore, the country appointed Mr. Noulens as the first ambassador to China. Because he has lived in China for many years, he is very familiar with the situation in our country and has a harmonious relationship with the people of our country. The increase in the number of Chinese directors in the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Department, and the execution of duties by Chinese lawyers in the French Concession, were all realized during Mr. Noulens' tenure as consul general in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Social Engagements</p>
<p>Mr. Noulens will host a reception for Chinese and foreign communities in Shanghai at the Consulate General at 4 p.m. today. Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, will also host a banquet at the World Academic Society on Fooking Road at 7 p.m. today to welcome Mr. Noulens, and invite celebrities from all walks of life to accompany him. At 8 p.m., the Sino-French Friendship Association will also hold a tea party at the World Academic Society to welcome him.

Is this feasible? Please vote on the proposal. Resolved: Approved. A special request is made to ratify the resolution. Resolved: Approved. Implemented starting June 30th.</p>
<p>Cash-on-Delivery Fund: The Huiliu General Association of the Money Trade Association has existed for a long time. Before the establishment of the Shanghai Bank Clearing House, it was the only clearing house for negotiable instruments in Shanghai. It stipulated that payments between industry members above 500 yuan must obtain an official bill and be totaled at the general association that evening. Most relied on the general association to collect payment. For balances below 500 yuan, there was no need to deliver cash. That is, each establishment contributed 30,000 yuan and handed it over to the Money Trade Joint Reserve Vault, called the "Cash-on-Delivery Fund", for safekeeping, and settled mutually at the end of each year. Now the Money Trade has decided to cancel the cash-on-delivery fund and settle directly with the Money Trade Reserve Vault every night. Yesterday, the member representative meeting approved the implementation starting today and has notified all member establishments to comply.</p>

<p>The second phase of smoker licenses, issued by the Municipal Public Security Bureau starting April 1st, was originally scheduled to expire on May 31st. However, because there were not many license renewals within the deadline, to give smokers a reasonable amount of time, the deadline was extended by one month to the end of June. In total, more than 21,000 people renewed their licenses. Compared to the original number of registered license holders, there is still a difference of more than 10,000 people. However, the bureau will not extend the second phase of licenses again and has decided that today is the last day. Each district will extend the hours to 7 p.m. After that, license renewals will be closed.</p>
<p>Sending Coolie Smokers for Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau started the general reporting work of smokers on May 10th, the reporting period will end on August 10th. As of the day before yesterday, a total of more than 6,500 smokers in the city who had not registered and obtained licenses had belatedly registered. Most of them are coolie smokers, and in fact, it is difficult for them to obtain a license and smoke. If they go to the hospital for rehabilitation, they will not have the money to pay for it. Therefore, the bureau will issue certificates to them separately and designate nearby hospitals in the smokers' locations for free rehabilitation. According to the statistics of various hospitals, more than 2,000 coolies have successfully quit their addiction.</p>
<p>Requesting Instructions on Concession Tobacco Prohibition in Beijing</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of drugs and tobacco in the concessions, although the Military Affairs Commission's General Supervision Department has separately instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Commissioner's Office, according to the Dagong News Agency reporter, the implementation methods have been discussed by the authorities several times. However, negotiations have not yet been formally submitted to the concession authorities. Therefore, it is expected that the implementation on July 1st will not achieve its goals. Mr. Ma Liang, the special commissioner stationed in Shanghai, went to Beijing on the evening of the 28th to report on the situation of tobacco prohibition in Shanghai to the General Supervision Department and other agencies, and to request instructions on various implementation methods such as tobacco prohibition in the concessions.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Impact of Smuggling on General Commodity Prices: Announcement by the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the wholesale export, import, and cost of living indices for Shanghai in May of the 25th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1936) all showed a slight decline compared to the previous month. The largest decline was in exports, at 2.9%, followed by wholesale prices at 1.4%. The declines in imports and the cost of living were more moderate, both below 0.5%. In recent months, smuggling in North China has become increasingly rampant. The types of smuggled goods, initially limited to artificial silk, sugar, and cigarette paper, have now spread to seafood, woolens, cotton cloth, flour, kerosene, gasoline, and various sundry goods. The sale of smuggled goods, initially confined to North China, is now encroaching on Central China. The decline in commodity prices this month is likely related to smuggling. It is hoped that the government's recent measures to investigate the transportation and sale of imported goods will be effective in preventing smuggling. Otherwise, there is a possibility that general commodity prices will continue to fall.</p>
<p>Wholesale Price Index: The general index was 105.8, a decrease of 1.4% compared to 107.3 last month, and an increase of 11.4% compared to 95.0 in the same month last year. In the full table, prices of 21 items increased, prices of 78 items decreased, and prices of 55 items remained unchanged. Compared to the previous month, all eight category indices showed a slight decline except for a slight increase in miscellaneous items. The largest declines were in food, textiles, metals, and chemicals. The other three categories all had declines of less than 0.8%. The food category index was 91.5, a decrease of 3.6% compared to 94.9 last month. The price of white rice decreased due to a large amount of Yangke Xian rice in stock and sluggish smuggling, while hoarders sold off stock due to the approaching mold season. The price of wheat decreased due to sluggish flour sales and the expectation of a good harvest in Jiangsu and Shandong. The price of soybeans decreased due to falling prices reported in Dalian and sluggish sales. The customs price uniformly depreciated. The sales of flour in Tianjin were affected by smuggling, but the price did not fall much due to cost factors. The textile and raw materials category index was 86.6, a decrease of 2.4% compared to 88.7 last month. The prices of artificial silk and cotton cloth both tended to weaken due to the impact of smuggling. The export of white silk was already sluggish, and recently, overseas Japanese silk was sold at a discount, so the selling price slightly decreased. The price of cotton fell along with silk and crepe because the market repeatedly spread rumors that the United States and China would establish cotton and wheat loans, and the sales of cloth were also depressed. The metal category index was 126.8, a decrease of 1.6% compared to 128.8 last month, due to sluggish sales and falling prices of lead and tin. In the chemical category, the index fell from 140.5 last month to 138.2 this month, a decrease of 1.6%, due to a sharp drop in the market price of Qingguangyuan and weakening prices of soda ash, alum, and paraffin. (Shenshi News Agency)</p>
<p>Export Price Index: The general index was 94.5, a decrease of 2.9% compared to 97.3 last month, and an increase of 26.0% compared to 75.0 in the same month last year. In the full table, prices of 12 items increased, prices of 37 items decreased, and prices of 17 items remained unchanged. All three category indices showed a uniform decline compared to the previous month. The index of raw materials was 83.6, a decrease of 3.7% compared to 86.8 last month. The export of white tung oil was sluggish, and the domestic sales of raw oil and asphalt were depressed. The prices of cotton yarn and white ash from ash factories uniformly depreciated. The raw materials index was 108.6, a decrease of 2.9% compared to 111.9 last month. Pure antimony, peanuts, and raw kernels all reported falling prices in the place of origin due to ample inventory. Ramie weakened because the new season was approaching and exports were sluggish. Other items, such as wheat, green beans, cotton, and Jian pine wood, also showed price declines. The consumer goods index was 77.0, a decrease of 1.3% compared to 78.0 last month. Flour and coarse cloth were affected by smuggling. The price of eggs fell, along with egg whites, Longkou vermicelli, and Huzhou silk crepe, due to seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Import Price Index: The general index was 140.3, a decrease of 0.4% compared to 140.9 last month, and an increase of 13.2% compared to 123.9 in the same month last year. In the full table, prices of 10 items increased, prices of 30 items decreased, and prices of 42 items remained unchanged. Compared to the previous month, the raw materials index slightly increased, while the consumer goods and raw materials indices slightly decreased. The raw materials index was 133.2, an increase of 1.0% compared to 131.9 last month. The prices of most items decreased, but the price of American cotton, which has the largest weight, increased in foreign markets due to the passage of the Smith-Connally Act in the United States, contrary to the trend of local cotton, so the market price was still higher than last month. Copper ingots and white coal also tended to be firm, so the category index slightly increased. The consumer goods index was 140.9, a decrease of 1.1% compared to 142.4 last month. Red and white sugar and flour were affected by smuggling and had sluggish sales, but the price did not fall much. Yangke rice, Yuan Yu silk, and fresh oranges also decreased in price. The raw materials index was 148.6, a decrease of 0.4% compared to 149.2 last month. The market price of artificial silk fell from 195 yuan per hundred pounds last month to 185 yuan this month due to the customs auction of large quantities of confiscated smuggled goods. Other items, such as fine foreign cloth, plain white iron, cut iron, soda ash, caustic soda, Qingguangyuan, writing paper, kraft paper, and coconut oil, also showed weakness.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The general index was 111.1, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 111.7 last month, and an increase of 5.2% compared to 105.6 in the same month last year. In the full table, prices of 9 items increased, prices of 11 items decreased, and prices of 23 items remained unchanged. Compared to the previous month, all five category indices showed a slight decline except for a slight increase in miscellaneous items. The food category index was 97.6, a decrease of 0.3% compared to 97.9 last month. Radishes, scallions, and tomatoes increased sharply, and pork and soybean oil tended to rise, but green vegetables and pickles suddenly fell sharply. The retail price of white rice, the most important item, also fell along with the wholesale price. The clothing index was 84.2, a decrease of 0.1% compared to 84.3 last month, due to the weakening sales price of cotton Zhigong cloth. The rent index fell from 110.3 last month to 109.6 this month, a decrease of 0.6%, as a result of recent surveys showing rent reductions in the eastern and northern districts of Shanghai. The price increases and decreases in the fuel and miscellaneous categories were both small. The former index was 127.2, a decrease of 4.0% compared to 132.5 last month, and the latter index was 154.9, an increase of 0.3% compared to 154.4 last month. The main reasons for the former were the price decrease of firewood, and for the latter, the slight increase in the selling price of soap. Shenshi News Agency</p>

<p>After the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee withheld the export of spring cocoons purchased by various silk factories and leftover cocoon merchants in the province at prices below the standard price, the Shanghai Silk Merchants Association telegraphed requesting their release. Although approval was granted and samples were taken for factory reeling trials to determine penalties, there were still some cocoons that had not been released. The Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association, after a general meeting, decided to send Chu Huiseng, Chen Qinshi, Gu Lianming, Zhou Yangsong, Chen Jingxian, and five other people to Beijing last night by the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train, carrying a petition to the National Economic Committee's Sericulture Improvement Committee and the Ministry of Industry, requesting the release of the detained spring cocoons, the cancellation of the new 5% business tax on the cocoon industry, the continuation of the old 2% tax, and the amendment of improvement fees, etc. (Petition omitted)</p>

<p>Entirely Monopolized by Taiwanese Tea</p>
<p>The consumption of tea in various parts of Northeast China is approximately 7 million to 10 million catties per year. Before the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), all tea was supplied by South China. After that, Japanese merchants engaged in the tea business initially shipped 500,000 catties of Taiwanese tea to Northeast China as samples. The following year, they shipped more than 1.6 million catties. In the past two years, under the control of the Japanese, the tea market in Northeast China has been entirely replaced by Taiwanese tea. The Japanese have also heavily promoted how exquisite and inexpensive Taiwanese tea is, thus opening up new territory in the Northeast. In addition, the Japanese have requested a reduction in tariffs on Taiwanese tea. The puppet government stipulated a tea tax plus additional tax totaling 55%. For example, if the tax standard price for Taiwanese tea is 58 yuan, the standard for Chinese South China tea is 77.5 yuan. The Japanese believe that the current difference of only 19.5 yuan is not enough. They must further increase the tariff rate on South China tea and reduce the tariff rate on Taiwanese tea in order to completely eliminate South China tea from the Northeast market. Currently, the puppet government will allow the Japanese request to reduce the new tax rate on Taiwanese tea.</p>

It is decided to close for two days on July 1st and 2nd. During this holiday period, the banks will still operate as usual. As for the business of each bank, it has been uniformly tightened and particularly cautious since last year, so there are very few bad debts, etc. Although the market is currently in a recession, they can still barely make a profit. The amount will be determined after July 2nd and formally announced by the Bankers' Association.</p>

<p>Polish Embassy Closed for One Day</p>
<p>June 29th is Polish Maritime Day. The Polish Community Committee in Shanghai held a grand celebration on the evening of that day. The Polish Embassy and Consulate also closed for one day on this day. Maritime Day was initiated by the Polish Maritime Overseas Association and supported by the whole country. Since 1932, it has been formally designated as this day every year. In the Polish port of Gdynia, representatives from various places gather to celebrate. Last year, more than 100,000 people attended, and three things were decided: 1. The whole country jointly raised funds to build the Navy National Defense Fund; 2. The youth of the whole country should devote themselves to serving the maritime interests of Poland; 3. Actively expand the maritime significance. The port is considered one of the country's most successful construction projects. Before the port was built, Poland's overseas trade relied on the port of Wuze for transportation. From 1923, the port of Gdynia was developed with all its strength, costing a total of 500 million yuan. It is now the largest commercial port on the Baltic coast. The Polish government and the public are all proud of this, so the military must hold Maritime Day there.</p>

<p>Creditors to Apply to the Court According to the Bankruptcy Law; Directors and Supervisors of Savings Deposits to be Jointly and Severally Liable for Repayment</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Associations received an order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "Upon investigation, in June of last year, this Ministry promulgated six measures for supervising and liquidating the banking and money house industries, dispatched commissioners to supervise and liquidate, and set a deadline of three months for completing the liquidation. The original intention was to urge the banks and money houses that had suspended operations to complete the liquidation as soon as possible and protect the interests of both debtors and creditors. Later, the liquidators and supervisors repeatedly reported the difficulties in the liquidation. This Ministry repeatedly approved extensions until the end of June this year. Now that the extension period is about to expire, the Bankruptcy Law has also been promulgated and implemented. The liquidation method stipulated in that law is more complete than the previous Provisional Regulations on the Liquidation of Merchant Debts. The local courts have a basis for handling these liquidation cases, and the progress has been quite effective. All supervisors and liquidation commissioners dispatched to the various banks and money houses should be dismissed uniformly at the end of June. The liquidation affairs should be handled by the various banks and money houses and their creditors themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law, applying to the local district court for supervision. As for savings deposits that have not yet been fully repaid, the directors and supervisors of the respective banks should be jointly and severally liable for repayment in full within this year's July, and no further delay should be allowed. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the association for compliance."</p>

Resolution: Temporarily remove him from his position and send a letter to the East District Rent Reduction Association to elect a replacement. Proposal: How should the chairman of the association be appointed? Resolution: The standing committee members should take turns electing a chairman at each meeting.

He proposed convening another meeting. Resolution: Passed. The New Gate District reported on the rent reduction matter of He Xing Lane on New Gate Road.

<h3 id="e130">Book Sellers Host Press Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Wang Longchao Reports on the Truth about Opposing Price Increases by Bookstores</p>
<p>The Hongwen, Nanxin, Jianshe, Bolan, Suxin and other bookstores in this city, because major bookstores are scheduled to increase book discounts from the 1st of next month, which has a significant impact on the future of their business, in addition to unanimously expressing their opposition, also hosted the press at Dalian Restaurant in Zhengjia Muqiao at 3:00 PM yesterday to report the truth about the matter. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended and were cordially received by Wang Longchao and other representatives of the industry. After being seated, Mr. Wang reported, saying that the bookstores in this city are divided into two types: publishing and selling, that is, the difference between large and small firms. There are more than 100 small firms in the city. The books of the major firms originally had a 60% to 70% discount, but later, because the major firms gave preferential treatment to various schools, the discounts on the books were arbitrarily reduced, which greatly affected the business of the small firms. Therefore, they had to reluctantly sacrifice and reduce the selling price to maintain their livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the major firms are now using the excuse that the discounts of the small firms are too rampant and are using the name of unifying the book price to actually increase the discounts and reduce the commission of the small firms to 20%. Each store believes that once this matter is realized, it will have a major impact on the future of their business. In addition to actively forming a trade association of booksellers, they will also argue with the major firms on the basis of reason and hope that the press will provide righteous assistance, etc. After the speech, tea and snacks were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Changxing Shipping Company, which operates the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, has been running the railway across Canada, all the way to the Pacific Coast since its initial opening on June 28, 1886, in "Montreal". June 28th of this year marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of the railway. The company held a grand celebration on that day. All locomotives and observation carriages were decorated luxuriously. There were very enthusiastic welcome ceremonies at major stations between "Montreal" and "Vancouver". Finance Minister Kong sent a congratulatory telegram saying, "Congratulations to your company on the 50th anniversary of the Trans-Canada Railway. I wish your company boundless progress." Railway Minister Zhang's congratulatory telegram was, "With the utmost sincerity, I congratulate your company on the 50th anniversary of the Trans-American Railway." Considering the recent surge in passengers and the long history of freight transport on Changxing Shipping Company's Sino-American routes, the congratulations from the two ministers are particularly appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e133">National Federation of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance: Kiln Owners' Payment Slips Exempt from Stamp Duty <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Because They are Part of the Porcelain Payment Process, Not Comparable to Invoices for Completed Sales</p>
<p>The Industrial Association reports that the National Federation of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Jingdezhen Chamber of Commerce in Jiangxi Province, which states: 'To the esteemed recipient, according to a letter from the Nine Kilns Association of this town, the procedures for buying and selling porcelain in Jingdezhen have special circumstances and differ from ordinary transactions. In ordinary transactions, customers come to the door, and the value of the goods can be decided on the spot. Once the transaction is completed, a list of the goods' value is prepared, stamps are affixed, and given to the customer, without further complications. However, the sale of porcelain is completely different. First, porcelain merchants or brokers negotiate prices on the street, and then the porcelain merchant sends a porter to the kiln owner to arrange for the loading of goods in baskets by a certain date. The kiln owner issues a payment slip to the porter who carries the porcelain. The payment slip is merely a procedure for counting the porcelain during the loading process and should not be considered a confirmation of the sale. According to the custom of selling porcelain, after the porcelain is loaded and arrives at the shop, the workers sort and select the porcelain. Sometimes five or six out of ten are kept, while other times six or seven out of ten are returned. After the sorting workers prepare a list of the actual goods received, it is sent to the kiln owner as a basis for future settlement. For example, if 100 pieces of porcelain are loaded, only 50 pieces may be sold. Therefore, the nature of the payment slip is merely a procedure in the process of selling porcelain. Moreover, the porcelain being purchased is loaded into the shop gradually, not all at once. The price of the porcelain is not listed on the payment slip, only the number of pieces. Only after all the porcelain is loaded will the previous porcelain slips be calculated, and the actual amount received and the price in foreign currency will be listed on a settlement sheet for final payment. Only then is the transaction completed. The settlement sheet should, of course, have stamps affixed, but the payment slip should be exempt. If the payment slip also requires stamps, then the same porcelain is taxed both on the goods and on the price, which is double taxation. The declining porcelain industry can hardly bear this double burden. Moreover, porcelain is a unique product of our country, and the government is enthusiastically promoting it. How can it bear to destroy it? Items such as kiln industry white clay, which are related to porcelain production, are generally exempt from taxes. This payment slip is not a formal transaction, so it should be exempt from stamp duty to show compassion. We sincerely request that you forward this to the Ministry of Finance for approval of the exemption. We are deeply grateful.' Furthermore, the Porcelain Red Shop Trade Association also sent a letter with the same content, among other things, to the association. After reviewing the payment slips issued by the kiln owners in this town, we found that they are a kind of payment process and not comparable to invoices for completed transactions. If stamps are required, not only will the procedure be cumbersome, but it will also inevitably lead to a heavy tax burden, which the merchants can hardly bear. The points mentioned are indeed the actual situation, and our association can vouch for them. May we be allowed to forward this to you to request approval of the exemption? We would be extremely grateful. Etc., as approved. It is reasonable to cable your ministry for review and approval, requesting that the payment slips issued by the kiln owners be exempt from stamp duty to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. We are deeply earnest. Respectfully, Wen Lanting, Acting Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China, kowtows. Printed."</p>

This has already begun. In addition, the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company has decided to donate one-tenth of its operating income on July 5th, as well as the salaries of all its employees on that day. Their enthusiasm and support are admirable.

All ticket revenue will be turned over to the association for the purchase of airplanes to celebrate the birthday. Since the launch of the fundraising campaign by the 32nd training students in Suzhou, activities are underway in various areas.

<h3 id="e144">Inland River Shipping Association Explains Reasons for Requesting the Enactment of Regulations on the Shipping Industry <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the newspaper reported that the Shipping Association's opinion on the shipping industry regulations was that the ocean and inland rivers should not be treated as one. Three opinions were stated, pointing out that the request was the private view of a part of the inland river small steamship industry. The reporter learned that the matter was handled by the Shanghai Municipal Inland River Shipping Association, which sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Executive Yuan for processing. A special visit was made to Mr. Han Yimin, the chairman of the association, who replied that the association's request to enact special regulations for the shipping industry was originally proposed for discussion at the current session of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Member Representatives' Meeting. However, because the meeting was adjourned before the discussion could take place, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Executive Yuan requesting that it be forwarded based on the review opinions, not just the private views of a part of the inland river small steamship industry. Moreover, it was confirmed by the committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reviewing the proposal that it was a matter that should be handled. 1. Although the nature of the shipping industry and the electricity industry are different, they are both public utilities. Therefore, it is natural to apply the principle of supply and demand for public utilities and to have the competent authorities exercise rational supervision. The Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities already include shipping transportation. Why should there be any objection because the authorities in the past did not implement them? In addition to running a shipping business, I also run an electricity business and have been a member of the Supervisory Committee of the National Federation of Privately Operated Electric Power Industries and a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Branch of the Federation for many years. I know more about the past malpractices of the privately operated electric power industry, such as disputes over operating areas, the decay of power poles, the simplicity of power generation equipment, and the poor management of operations. These various ailments are just like the situation of the shipping industry today. However, since the Central Construction Commission established various special regulations and implemented supervision, standards for engineering and technology have been established, and rational protection, guidance, and suppression have been given to operations and management. Over the years, all the ailments have been reformed. It is difficult for the colleagues in the electric power industry to work hard on their own business. However, if there were no management regulations and the supervision of the competent authorities, I am afraid that this result could not be achieved. From this point of view, the association's request to enact shipping industry regulations is indeed a fundamental way to save China's shipping industry. 2. Although China's shipping industry has been restricted by unequal treaties and the loss of inland navigation rights, it is undeniable that the state-owned ships are old, and the operation is improper. At a time when commercial competition is becoming increasingly fierce, if there are no good laws to manage the shipping industry, not only will competition among colleagues be impossible to resolve, but also the attempt to recover navigation rights and develop the national shipping industry will be impossible to carry out. 3. In addition to the Maritime Law, the remaining shipping regulations, the various chapters on ship measurement and inspection, and the nationality certificate are all regulations solely governing ships, not laws for managing the shipping industry. This has resulted in shipping merchants having no protection in their business, and shipping route disputes are endless. In view of this, the association has requested the enactment of special regulations for the shipping industry as a fundamental solution. The association did not study it and hastily adjusted the existing regulations to be perfect. It has ignored the current ills of the shipping industry and failed to understand the purpose of the association's original proposal, which is regrettable. In short, China's shipping industry has a great and significant impact on national defense and political economy at this time of serious national crisis and national peril. It is the duty of the shipping administration authorities and shipping merchants to seek reasonable solutions. I hope that the government authorities and colleagues in various places will work together with a pragmatic approach to seek legitimate and reasonable ways to save the precarious shipping industry and complete the national defense. Fostering the country's interests and benefiting the people is not something that ignorant shipping merchants can gain or lose.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Inspection Office Reorganized as a General Bureau by Order <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>To Be Implemented on July 1st with Expansion of Various Departments; Salt Affairs Division Also Renamed Salt Affairs Administration to Centralize Authority</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Inspection Office has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be reorganized as a General Bureau starting from July 1st. All authority will be expanded compared to the present situation. All Salt Affairs Divisions will also be renamed Salt Affairs Administrations. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reorganized as a General Bureau: In order to centralize the authority of salt affairs, unify inspections, and increase the efficiency of national tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance will expand the organization of salt affairs agencies, reorganizing the Salt Affairs Inspection Office currently stationed in Shanghai as a Salt Affairs General Bureau. The organizational charter has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Inspection Office to implement the reorganization starting from July 1st, adopting a director-general system. The internal departments will also be expanded.</p>
<p>Establishment of Salt Administration: The highest agency for all matters concerning the management of salt affairs is the Salt Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance. Previously, due to the expansion of the scope of salt affairs, the Ministry of Finance planned to improve the work by changing the Salt Affairs Division to the Salt Affairs Administration. The candidate for the director-general of the Administration is likely to be the current Director of the Division, Zhu Tingqi. Zhu will also concurrently serve as the Director-General of the Salt Affairs General Bureau.</p>
<p>Salt Mound Project: According to a Dagongshe reporter's investigation, the salt mounds built by the Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Inspection Office in the salt areas on both sides of the Huainan and Huaibei areas are quite large in scale. The internal equipment for salt storage and salt production is arranged in the latest style. The salt mound projects on both sides have been completed, and it is expected that the output will increase year by year with this new equipment. Other salt production areas are also continuing to build in the same way.</p>

<p>At about 11:00 PM last night, three bandits speaking with northern accents suddenly came to the small cigarette and paper shop opened by Meng Jiao at 884 Yongxing Road, Zhabei. One bandit was wearing a white short shirt and black pants, and the other two bandits were wearing black jackets and pants. They showed a pistol and forbade anyone from making a sound. They rummaged through boxes and cabinets, robbing 28.4 yuan in silver and cash. They fled out the door towards the open space on the west side. After the incident, the police in charge learned of it, and the Xu Bao branch bureau is investigating and pursuing the thieves.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Observatory Forecasts Hot Weather in the City Today; Local Thunderstorms Yesterday, But Still Sultry; Few Cases of Epidemic Disease; Sanitation Campaign Concluded <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>From the 27th to yesterday, the entire city was hit by a heat wave, with sultry heat that was suffocating. Although there was a temporary respite due to showers yesterday afternoon, the observatory reported that the weather will continue to be hot in the coming days. At this time of year, it will get hotter day by day. Yesterday's highest temperature was 94.6 degrees. This morning started out quite cool, but by 10:00 AM it gradually became hot. The standard thermometer at Xujiahui read 86 degrees, and by 11:30 AM, the thermometer had risen to 92.5 degrees. However, the outdoor temperature had already reached 97 degrees, which is a new record for this year.</p>
<p>Local Thunderstorms Offer Slight Relief</p>
<p>Between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM today, the city experienced thunderstorms and torrential rain that poured down in an instant, driving away the scorching sun. However, the rain was only local at the time, extending only from Jing'an Temple to the Bund. West of Jing'an Temple, Xujiahui, Avenue Joffre, and the western district still did not see any rainfall, but there were dark clouds looming in the northeast. Later in the afternoon, the rain area expanded, and there was rainfall everywhere, intermittent and varying in intensity, resembling the plum rain season. The climate also cooled down slightly.</p>
<p>Epidemic Hospitals Crowded with Patients</p>
<p>Because citizens cannot endure the heat, they flock to places selling cold drinks, resulting in a threefold increase in business for ice cream parlors. Street vendors selling cold drinks are also crowded with laborers, but because the drinks are often unhygienically prepared, there is a risk of disease. Epidemic hospitals have sprung up in response. The Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road is scheduled to open on the 1st of next month. The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital has already admitted patients. In addition, the Zhabei Public Hospital is also said to be opening at the same time as the Emergency Epidemic Hospital. According to reports from the city's health authorities, there are not many cases of epidemic disease reported in recent days.</p>
<p>Researching Prevention of Schistosomiasis</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Health recently discovered schistosomes in the Luobiegen Road area of western Shanghai. These worms are hidden in unclean marshes. If people or animals swim in them, they can easily be infected, which poses a risk of spreading. A Dagongshe reporter learned yesterday morning that the Bureau of Health is now researching how to eliminate these dangerous worms. Many people have been affected by them, ranging from a pale complexion to the development of ascites. Therefore, they must be eliminated.</p>
<p>Sanitation Campaign Concludes Today</p>
<p>Since its launch, the city's 15th Sanitation Campaign has made every effort to promote summer sanitation, which has greatly benefited citizens. The campaign is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony at the Confucius Temple at 10:00 AM on the 30th to mark its conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Near the Huangpu River Fish Market: A Robbery on the River. Eight Robbers with a Wooden Gun Steal Thirty-Seven Cases of Cigarettes <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>On the 27th of this month, a lighter fully loaded with cigarettes was robbed on the river surface near the Pujiang Fish Market. A reporter from the Datong News Agency investigated and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Sailing from Shanghai to Songjiang</p>
<p>The merchants of Laosheng, Tonghexiang, Xiangdalong, Zhangyuanmao, etc., in Wusong Town purchased 39 cases of various cigarettes from Yongtaihe, Huacheng, Zhonghe, and other tobacco companies in this port on the 27th of this month, along with matches, soap, and other supplies. They hired Wang A'huo's lighter to load them and set sail from the Second Baidu Bridge at 7:30 p.m. that evening, heading for Wusong.</p>
<p>River Robbery</p>
<p>At 11:30 p.m., the boat reached near the Qiujiang Wharf of the Fish Market (the new houses area). Suddenly, it encountered another lighter. The two boats were very close. Eight robbers jumped out from the boat (one of them had a wooden gun), boarded the cigarette lighter, tied up the crew, and assigned a robber to guard them.</p>
<p>Reward for Recovering Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The remaining robbers moved the cigarettes to their boat. It was not until the sky was slightly bright the next day that they finished the robbery. Then, they shouted and sailed away. After checking, a total of 37 cases of cigarettes were robbed, resulting in a significant loss. The owner has reported the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team and various agencies for investigation. At the same time, a reward of 500 yuan has been offered for the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the stolen goods, in order to quickly solve the case and deter the bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Harmful Influence of Sword Hero Novels: Two Boys Missing. They Usually Wanted to Learn Sword Flying and Invisibility Techniques. This Disappearance May Be Due to the Poison of the Books <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The boy Zhou Xingqi (nicknamed Xindi), 14 years old, a local resident, lives at 518 Zhejiang Road. Zhang Demin, 14 years old, from Huzhou, lives in Gengyuli, Xiaocai Market, Beijing Road. They are both fourth-grade students at Qianjiang Elementary School in the Qianjiang Guild Hall in Zhongwang Lane nearby. The two boys are usually obsessed with reading illustrated sword hero novels. They share the same interests and are very close. They often revealed to their classmates that they planned to go to famous mountains such as Kunlun and Emei to find teachers to learn sword flying and invisibility magic, in order to serve the country. The listeners thought of the two boys' crazy talk and did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the two boys disappeared at the same time at 10 a.m. the other day (Sunday the 28th). The family initially thought they had gone to relatives' homes. When they did not return in the evening, they began to search everywhere. According to people who knew them, the two boys were seen carrying packages and heading north together. The two parents, in addition to reporting to the British and French Concession police stations and the Public Security Bureau to request attention to detention, also hope that kind gentlemen, if they encounter them, will accompany them home. There will be a generous reward, so as to avoid being deceived and reunite the family.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Manufacturing Drugs, Moving Residences Repeatedly, But Finally Caught. Three Male and Female Criminals Arrested. Many Instruments Were Found <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Zhengong (also known as A'shun) and Xiao Deming (i.e., Huang Deming), from Chaoyang, Guangdong, specialize in manufacturing and selling morphine in Shanghai. Because of strict inspections, their manufacturing organs move from time to time. On the 9th of last month, they moved from a certain place to 677 Changping Road, West Shanghai. They manufactured until the end of the month, and then moved to 384 Met Hess Road. They worked for two weeks. Again, because of the urgent news, on the 23rd of this month, they moved again to the third floor of 42 Wuding Road. The facade here is a straw mat shop, thinking that it would not be noticed by outsiders. They arranged everything properly and were just waiting to start work. Finally, they were detected by Li Shizhong, Detective of Xinzha Police Station, and Ye Yushan, Detective. At 2:30 p.m. last Saturday, they rushed to search and arrest with Western detectives. However, Zhengong Deming and the Zheng family had already received the news and escaped without a trace. Only Zhengong's mistress, Li, and Huang Zhenkun, Lin Ruitang, and other three men and women were caught. The manufacturing equipment found included a motor, four basins, four sieves, three rubber tubes, one pot, one magnetic cylinder, two copper basins, and knives, spoons, glass bottles, and other items. The raw materials for drug production were seized on the spot, including two bags of white powder, two bottles of compounds, and various potions, too numerous to mention. They were all escorted to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Tan opened the court for interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, filed a complaint according to Article 256, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and explained the situation of the case, and requested an extension because the mastermind was at large, so as to arrest and investigate the case together. Then, the confession form of the three criminals and the list of seized items were submitted to the case. After Judge Tan checked, he interrogated Li, who confessed that she was a native of Chaoyang, 20 years old this year. Her husband's surname was Chen. Because there was a senior wife in the family, she could not bear the abuse. She recently fled from her hometown to Shanghai, working in the home of a fellow villager. She met Xiao Zhengong and began to live together. Although Xiao was a shareholder, he did not pay any capital. All the capital was borne by Huang Deming. The Zheng family was the engineer. The manufacturing machine was set up once when it was located on Met Hess Road. It had not been opened since it moved to Wuding Road. The second and third defendants were both orchid friends. They just came on the morning of the 27th. Because they did not know the situation, they were arrested with me. Huang Zhenkun also confessed that he came to Shanghai from Chaoyang to visit friends and seek employment. It has only been more than ten days. He went to the orchid family that day and was arrested. Lin Ruitang also confessed that he was unemployed and helped Xiao. He also denied helping to make drugs. The police lawyer stated that Lin Ruitang also often went to Xiao's home. This time, the police station investigated Changping Road, and Lin guided them. The court believed that the case still needed investigation, and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody for another trial.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Failing to Find a Lover, Threatening with a Bomb. It Is Not Yet Clear Whether the Can Contains a Bomb. Lu Qichang Will Be Tried Again in Five Days <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Lu Qichang, a Cantonese, had previously known Zhong Huisheng, the second wife of a wealthy man. Now, Zhong made excuses to go to Guangdong and avoid meeting Lu. Lu found out that Zhong lived in Mei Jin's house at 5 Yunshoufang, Yu Garden Road. On the 23rd of the month, at 9 p.m., he brought a square and a round can to Mei's house, asking about Zhong's whereabouts. Because Mei Jin said she did not know, Lu declared that the two cans he brought today were bombs and that they would die together. He also took out a fruit knife and stabbed his throat twice to intimidate. Mei reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detective Zhang Liang to arrest Lu. Because he was injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. One side will put the two cans in the water to prevent accidents. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Lin of the First Court tried the case. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the police station, said that the case has now been prosecuted under Article 305 of the Criminal Law, and the injury of the defendant Lu Qichang has not reached the throat or trachea, so he can come to court today. As for what is in the two cans, according to Lu, it is yellow sand, gravel and Sanhuang powder, etc., but the police station is afraid that it is not true, so it has not been opened and is still placed in the water. However, whether it is a bomb or not is very important to this case. If it is a bomb, the indictment should be changed. Therefore, please postpone this case again to find out the truth. Then, Mei Jin proved that Lu did say that the two cans were bombs at the time. When asked Lu Qichang, he confessed that the cans were indeed yellow sand, gravel, etc., not explosives. Judge Chuan checked the confession and decided to postpone the trial of the case for five days.</p>

<p>Zhu Xiongwu, a dismissed clerk of the Jiangsu Higher Court, was prosecuted by the Procuratorate of Wu County Local Court for colluding with Chen Chaoxu, a court clerk, and Lu Wenguang, a lawyer's clerk, to solicit lawsuits and defraud litigants of money. After the prosecution was filed in the Criminal Court of Wu County Local Court, Zhu Xiongwu immediately applied to the Supreme Court for approval to transfer the jurisdiction to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. For the convenience of the trial, the Wu County Court transferred the two defendants, Chen and Lu, to Shanghai together. The First Special Court has opened the court three times, summoning witnesses, and the trial has ended. Chen Chaoxu was ordered to pay 500 yuan to be released on bail, and Zhu and Lu were detained pending the public verdict. The details have been reported in this newspaper many times. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., it was the date of the sentencing. However, Chen did not appear in court. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the two defendants, Zhu and Lu, to be brought to court to announce the verdict. It was ruled that each of the charges against Zhu and Lu were partially established. Zhu was sentenced to two years in prison, and Lu was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Chen Chaoxu was declared not guilty of leaking secrets. If they do not accept the verdict, they can appeal according to law. Zhu and others requested to be released on bail, but the court did not approve it, and ordered the bailiffs to take the two people back to the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Minghua Bank Case: Miao Zhenjin Increased Bail. Because Miao Urgently Needs to Go to Fujian to Make Arrangements. The Previous Guarantee Amount Was Too Small <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Minghua Ming Bank went bankrupt and was approved by the First Special District Local Court to declare bankruptcy. Later, the bank's assistant manager, Miao Zhen, was jointly accused of embezzlement and fraud in a criminal self-accusation by the bankruptcy administrator, Lawyer Li Mian, and Accountant An, along with its general and deputy managers, Zhang Jiongbo and Yu Dehua. The court has been opened many times. Because Zhang Gangbo has not been brought to justice, Yu and Miao were ordered to be released on bail separately to await interrogation. Now Miao needs to go to Fujian to seek employment. He went to notify the plaintiff last Saturday and stated that he would return to Shanghai to be interrogated when the trial was scheduled. However, the plaintiff was afraid that Miao would take the opportunity to leave Shanghai and escape from then on. Therefore, on the afternoon of that day, he urgently secretly informed Dean Guo, requesting him to quickly arrest Miao to avoid being escaped. Dean Guo sent the secret report to Judge Tan Xinzhen, who was hearing the case, for handling. Judge Tan immediately signed an arrest warrant and sent bailiffs to Miao's house. Miao was summoned to the case yesterday afternoon. At 2 p.m., Judge Tan opened the court and asked why he planned to go to Fujian immediately. According to Miao, a friend who worked in the Fujian Provincial Government promised to arrange a position for him in the Fujian Provincial Bank. He should go there to wait first. Therefore, he asked the plaintiff on the previous Saturday. He planned to set off in four or five days. He would surrender himself when he heard the trial date. Judge Tan said that Miao Zhen's lawsuit was not closed and he was not allowed to leave Shanghai according to law. Since it was stated that the matter was for the purpose of seeking employment and he would never escape, but the previous guarantee of only 200 yuan was too small and not enough for security. He ordered Miao to increase the bail to 2,000 yuan in legal currency. If he could not raise it, he would change to a store guarantee of 3,000 yuan and wait for the scheduled summons and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e154">People in the Cultural Circle Call for the Rescue of Xu Wancheng. Pity for His Weak Body and Contributions to Literature. Send a Letter to the Court to Allow Bail <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to the Rural Society, Xu Wancheng, the owner of the Longwen Bookstore in Dananmen, this port, was previously summoned by the court for investigation because he edited the Special Issue of Work Report, which was published in various newspapers in this port. The content involved the reputation of the judges of the Shanghai Local Court and was prosecuted for the crime of obstructing official duties and defamation. He was ordered to be detained. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that people from all walks of life in the cultural circle believe that Mr. Xu has devoted himself to writing and has made contributions to culture. They cannot remain silent now that Mr. Xu is in prison. Therefore, Wang Boqun, President of Daxia University, Wu Zhiqian, Principal of Shanghai Girls' High School, Zhang Zhonghuan, Principal of Xinhua Vocational High School, Lou Chanwen, Shimin Night School, and Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press, Jiang Kanghu, a master of Chinese studies, Ma Gongyu, a calligrapher, Xu Xiaotian, a novelist, and Yao Shou Kang, an inventor, jointly appealed to the Shanghai Local Court to allow bail. It is heard that the reason for the rescue is that Xu's carelessness in writing involves the judiciary, which is a negligence and cannot be denied. However, considering that Mr. Xu's body is weak and he has recently fallen ill, in this hot summer, he cannot bear the suffering of being imprisoned, which is very pitiful. Moreover, Mr. Xu is also a talent in society and has made contributions to literature. Sending a letter requesting bail for rescue is also a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Zhao Anzhi's painting exhibition was on the fourth floor of 115 Sanma Road. Yesterday was the third day. Although it was raining heavily, Chinese and Western guests were still coming in an endless stream. Everyone praised Zhao's profound skills. His calligraphy and painting are excellent. Whether it is sketching or creation, every grass and stone has its own origin. He can gather the strengths of various schools and integrate them into one. The exquisite use of colors, such as Qingsi pearl powder and other treasures, are all old objects from the Ming and Qing Dynasties, which cannot be purchased in the market today. Therefore, his paintings are valued by Chinese and Western people. The promotion of national glory relies heavily on Zhao. Recently, Dr. Jiang Kanghu slightly obtained many paintings by Zhao to participate in the Canadian Chinese Cultural Relics Exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Female Bandit Directing Male Robbers to Rob. Three Months Later, the Victim Met the Female Bandit on the Road. She Was Handed Over to the Police Station and an Accomplice Was Arrested <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Chen Meizhen, a Suzhou woman living at 6 Tai'an Lane, Beller Road, French Concession, is 23 years old this year. She used to run a brothel in a shop room in Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, Fuzhou Road, Public Concession. At 4:30 a.m. on March 14th of this year, three robbers suddenly came to Chen Meizhen's house, including two men and one woman. First, the two men entered and tied Meizhen's hands behind her back and covered her eyes with cloth. Then, the female bandit entered and directed the male robbers to rob. While searching, the cloth covering the victim Meizhen's face suddenly loosened and fell off. She glimpsed that the female bandit was Ma Laoliu (31 years old), a fellow villager who used to be in the Huile Lane shop room. At that time, because the robbers had guns, she dared not speak out and let them rob her of jewelry worth 980 yuan and other items and escape with the stolen goods. Afterwards, she issued a loss report and reported to the French police station, requesting investigation and arrest, but she never found them. Unexpectedly, the case has happened for more than three months. At 8 p.m. on the 27th of this month, Chen Meizhen was walking through the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Edward Road when she happened to meet the female bandit Ma Laoliu face to face. She immediately grabbed Ma and arrested her into the Huisi Police Station. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the French Police Station was notified. Detective Wang Rusong, Liu Jinrong, and Detective Shen Jinshu went to the French Police Station to interrogate Ma Laoliu, who confessed that the accomplices were the principal offender Pan Haiyuan (39 years old, Suzhou, owner of Yilai Electrical Appliance Store, 682 Wuma Road,) and Pan's younger brother Pan A'si (now at large). The detectives continued to arrest Pan Haiyuan. It was found that Pan and Ma Laoliu used to live together in adultery and were detained together. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the Police Department, stated the case, slightly saying that the defendants were involved in a gang of three people carrying weapons to rob. The Police Department has not completed the investigation and requested an extension. Then, detective Liu Jinrong reported the process of arresting the defendants. After Judge Li Changnian checked the report and questioned the defendants, the defendants all denied being robbers and robbers. The court ordered to change the date to July 8 to find out the facts and then interrogate the defendants and return them to custody. Ma's defense lawyer requested bail on behalf of him, but the court did not allow it.</p>
<h3 id="e158">A Passenger Jumped into the Sea and Committed Suicide on the New Jiangtian Steamer. Li Lian, a Native of Zhenhai, Left a Suicide Note. Three Elderly Relatives and Two Young Daughters Were Left Behind in the Central Egg Factory in Hongkou <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The New Jiangtian Steamer of the State-run China Merchants Bureau, which runs the Shanghai Line, set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5 p.m. on the 27th. At more than 11 o'clock that night, the ship passed the waters of Wai Tongsha. A middle-aged passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea. A reporter from Datong News Agency investigated and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Committing Suicide by Jumping into the Sea The New Jiangtian Steamer set sail from Shanghai to Yong at 5 p.m. on the 27th. At that time, there was a middle-aged passenger in the first-class cabin of the ship. He also took the ship and planned to land in Zhenhai. At more than 11 o'clock that night, when the ship passed the waters of Wai Tongsha, the passenger suddenly left his berth and went elsewhere. At that time, the waiter in charge of the berth thought he was afraid of the noise and went to the deck to chat, but he never returned.</p>
<p>Discovery of Suicide Note The ship berthed in Zhenhai at about 4 a.m. the next morning. Although the waiter searched, he never found the passenger's trace. Then, he checked his berth and found a suicide note. The letter was written to his cousin Zhou Zipin, No. 2 Cunshuli, Muqiao Street, Nanshi, Shanghai. There were no other relics. After reading the suicide note, he learned that the passenger's name was Li Lianzhang, 33 years old, a native of Zhenhai. He is now working in the Central Egg Factory in Waihongqiao. The meaning of the book is to entrust his cousin to take care of the orphans.</p>
<p>Reason for Suicide Datong News Agency reporter visited Zhou Zipin at No. 2 Cunshuli, Senqiao Street, yesterday morning. According to Zhou, the deceased was extremely honest. From February last year, he worked with me as an accountant in the Sichuan Mianzhu Tobacco Tax Bureau. After resigning in March this year, he returned to Shanghai together. The deceased had previously served as the Nanjing Special Commissioner of the Central Egg Factory. Recently, the factory resumed its business. Because I had an old relationship with the manager of the factory, I promoted him again and returned to his old position. Unexpectedly, someone slandered him to the manager and was dismissed. Now he is depressed.</p>
<p>Leaving Behind Orphans At the same time, the deceased's parents died and his wife died two years ago, leaving behind two daughters, both of whom are young. They are now in their hometown and are cared for by his old and dependent mother-in-law and grandmother. There is also a stepmother in Shanghai. The above relatives are all supported by the deceased. Therefore, the burden is heavy and the debts are heavy. The above reasons really started his suicide. However, the old parents and young daughters all depend on him for survival. He actually came up with this bad idea. It is really inconsiderate.</p>

<p>Requesting All Circles to Uphold Justice and Redress Bo Shen's Grievance The Fourth Branch of the Citizens' Association Will Hold an Emergency Meeting Today. The case of Hua Bu shooting and killing Nantong personnel Shi Lin, which occurred in the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road, French Concession, this port, and the arrest of his younger brother Ji A'er by the French Police Station, recognizing him as having committed injury and attempted murder, and the prosecution in the Second Special District Local Court, which sentenced him to 20 days of detention the other day, and acquitted the rest of the defendants, have been reported in this newspaper many times. Since the occurrence of this case, the citizens in the area have been extremely indignant at the Hua Detective's indiscriminate firing of shots and disregard for human life. It is now known that the widow Ji Yang, the wife of the deceased's brother, has been wronged and cannot be justified because Bo was killed and her husband was sentenced. She sent a document to the Citizens' Association of the Fourth District and all circles yesterday, crying out for assistance in upholding justice and redressing Bo's grievance. It is heard that the Municipal Association has decided to convene an emergency meeting today to discuss countermeasures. The details are divided into the following:</p>
<p>The Family of the Deceased Cries Out for Assistance from All Circles</p>
<p>Ji Yang cried out to all circles yesterday in a document saying, Mr. Li's husband, Ji A'er, borrowed eight yuan of usurious money from Wu Cao, who lives at No. 8 Runde Nanli, Huanghe Road, in May of last year (lunar calendar), calculating the interest at six copper coins per yuan per day, and paid it daily. He failed to pay it in November because he was unable to pay. Unexpectedly, Wu Cao entrusted a co-tenant, Chen Xiangrong, to forcibly collect the principal and interest when he failed to receive the money. Mr. Li's husband was unable to pay because he was short of money and asked for installment payments, but Chen refused. This was because Chen had a private grudge against Mr. Li's husband, so he repeatedly harassed him under the pretext. On June 4th of this year, Mr. Li's husband, Ji A'er, happened to meet Chen at his Yue's house at No. 4 Runde Nanli, and Chen Xiangrong again made trouble for Mr. Li's husband under the pretext of collecting usurious money for Wu Cao. They argued and then fought, and Mr. Li's husband was severely beaten. They also agreed to have tea and discuss the matter at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road at 2 p.m. on June 5th. Mr. Li's husband, Ji A'er, was afraid of being at a disadvantage, so he asked Ji Shilin to go with him. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the tea house, Hua Detective Sun Qiwan, No. 76 of the French Police Station, went upstairs to ask Mr. Li's husband, Ji A'er, and then handcuffed him and threatened him with a gun. Mr. Li's husband and uncle were shocked when they saw this and went downstairs to escape. Unexpectedly, the detective pursued and fired in the staircase, immediately hitting Mr. Li's uncle Ji Shilin. The bullet entered from the back and exited from the chest, and he ran to the door of the tailor shop at No. 8 Jialu Road and died on the spot. The patrol then arrested Mr. Li's husband, Ji A'er, on suspicion of harming Hua Detective, and prosecuted him in the Second Special District Local Court for attempted murder. He was sentenced to 20 days of detention the other day. The thought of the deceased's grievance has not been redressed, and her husband has been sentenced again. Such a grievance is truly shocking. Thinking that your association is a foundation for the citizens of this district and spares no effort to protect the citizens, I hereby present the situation of the incident in detail and cry out for assistance, asking you to uphold justice and give assistance to negotiate with the French authorities to bring the murderers to justice, so as to value human life and prevent the feelings from being 感 　.</p>
<p>The Fourth District of the Municipal Association Will Hold a Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association of this city received a petition from the family of the deceased requesting assistance. Since the matter concerns human life, it is specifically scheduled to convene an emergency meeting of all executive committee members at the association at No. 132 Bair Road at 5 p.m. on the 30th of this month (Tuesday) to discuss countermeasures. The corresponding letter is hereby sent to your committee member for your reference. Please be sure to attend on time and do not delay. It is also heard that the association has also sent a letter to the Nantong Fellow Villagers' Association and invited Lawyer Cai to attend to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Two Shipping Accidents Reported <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>"Chun He" Grounded in Haizhou</p>
<p>The "Chun He" vessel, chartered by the Shanghai Mainland Industrial Company, with a deadweight of 1,765 tons, a length of 255 feet and 2 inches, a width of 35 feet and 2 inches, and a draft of 17 feet and 4 inches, was en route to Haizhou to load salt for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that when the "Chun He" finished loading in Haizhou and departed, the water level in Haizhou harbor was shallow, only about 12 feet at low tide. The "Chun He," fully loaded, had a draft of over 17 feet. Consequently, the ship ran aground at the harbor entrance, becoming stuck in the mud and unable to move at all. The shipowner tried various methods, including reversing the engine repeatedly, but failed to dislodge the vessel. Attempts to tow it also failed. Yesterday, the Shanghai company received this telegram, fearing prolonged grounding would damage the hull and cargo. They sent an urgent telegram to Haizhou, instructing the shipowner and the local salt depot authorities to hire large towing barges to quickly offload the salt from the "Chun He" to reduce its weight, and then arrange for a ship to tow the "Chun He" to safety.</p>
<p>"Ji Kang" Blown Ashore by Wind</p>
<p>The "Ji Kang" large iron barge belonging to Kang Zhen Ji in Shanghai, carrying a huge amount of goods, was transporting cargo from Lianyungang in the old kiln area of Haizhou. At 10 AM on the 27th of this month, a storm with heavy rain and turbulent waves, rarely seen before, occurred in Lianyungang. Many barges and civilian boats in the harbor were damaged or drifted away. The "Ji Kang" barge, located in the center of the harbor, was struck by a huge wave during the storm and blown directly onto a rocky beach. The bottom of the "Ji Kang" was completely broken on the rocks. The extent of the damage and loss is imaginable. The hull remains aground on the rocky beach, impossible to salvage. Yesterday, the ship's manager urgently telegraphed Shanghai, seeking instructions on rescue measures. The company is currently considering rescue plans.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Incident in the Second Special District Prison: Clash Between Chinese and Russian Inmates <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>In the Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession, at approximately 9 AM the day before yesterday, inmates Zhao Zhongheng, Tian Jinhai, Chen Dianxi, Lin Tingxi, and others, totaling fourteen, were taking a bath in the bathroom when they had a verbal argument with three Russian inmates over a minor issue. The argument escalated into a physical fight. Prison guards tried their best to stop them, but the inmates refused to comply and could not be controlled. The guards fired three warning shots into the air and telephoned the Lukiawan Police Station, requesting a large number of detectives to assist. The disturbance was eventually quelled. The detectives took the Chinese and Russian inmates involved in the incident, as well as the injured Russian inmates, back to the police station for questioning and sent them to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that the cause of the incident was that the Russian inmates had beaten a Chinese inmate the day before, causing injury. The remaining inmates then used this as an excuse to seek revenge. Another account suggests that the Russian inmates received better food and treatment than the Chinese inmates in prison, a privilege granted by the government, which led to resentment among the Chinese inmates. The French police are currently investigating the matter and will send the suspects to the Second Special Court for interrogation today.</p>

It is reported that the owner is an official of the French Municipal Council, but he was not driving at the time of the accident. The Frenchman who was driving is believed to be an employee of the Shanghai Telephone Company.

<p>Caught Together in the Attic</p>
<p>Chen Qingyu, a local resident, lives at No. 24 Pingjiang Lane, Route Laveille in the French Concession. He has an elderly mother, and his wife, Shi Xiubao, is 34 years old and has three children. Yu Shanchen, a Ningbo native, is 23 years old. Introduced by a friend, he became Chen Qingyu's apprentice and regularly visited the Chen home. In February of this year, Chen's mother fell ill and was bedridden. Yu took advantage of the opportunity to have an affair with his teacher's wife, Shi Xiubao. Shi often made excuses to go out for secret meetings, and the affair had been going on for a long time. Chen Qingyu had heard rumors about this secret, but he lacked concrete evidence and had been secretly enduring it. The day before yesterday, Shi Xiubao again made an excuse to take her young son out. Chen found out and sent someone to secretly follow them. The follower saw Shi Xiubao carrying her son to No. 13 Dakang Lane on Baier Road. The follower saw a "For Rent" sign posted outside the house and pretended to be interested in renting the room. He learned that Shi Xiubao and Yu Shanchen were living together in the attic. He returned and reported this to Chen Qingyu. At 3 AM that night, Chen reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Yu and Shi Xiubao and take them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing. 　The lawyer stated that the defendants were arrested for adultery. The investigation is not yet complete and requested a postponement. The plaintiff, Chen Qingyu, also submitted a statement of the case, requesting that it be handled according to the law. At that time, the defendants confessed to the crime. However, Shi Xiubao pointed out in court that her husband also had mistresses outside. The court verified the confession and rescheduled the hearing for July 7. The defendants were either released on bail or detained without bail.</p>

<p>Two People Involved are Arrested</p>
<p>Wen Xiushan (40 years old), a Fuding native residing at No. 31 Wuzhou Road, reported that his 21-year-old wife, Wu, went out to bathe at around 8 PM on the evening of the 9th of this month and suddenly disappeared. It was later discovered that Xiao Jinbao, a leather worker from the same village, had facilitated her affair with a Jiangbei native named Wang Debao. At that time, he hired a car to take Wu to a small inn on the Zhabei Han Bridge, where they stayed overnight. He then accompanied Wu to a hiding place in Ningbo. Wang Debao's mother, Ni, knew the information and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The police first arrested Xiao Jinbao and then arrested Wang Ni at No. 21 Yangshupu Road. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Fen presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Municipal Council stated that Wang Debao and Wen Wu's whereabouts are currently unknown, but the plaintiff, after mediation, will file a separate lawsuit in court. After questioning Wen Xiushan, he claimed that Zhang, the second landlord of Wang Ni, told him, "Your wife can be found. Don't pursue the matter." "I will definitely return Wu, and the result will be dropped." Wang Ni's attorney stated that Wu was not Wen's legal wife but a concubine. In May, due to disagreements between the two parties, a letter was sent through Lawyer Ma to sever their relationship as husband and concubine. It was questioned that after his wife died, he married Wu Mao as his successor, not as a concubine. They were married last June, and her parents now live at No. 77 Shenjiatan, Yangshupu, and can testify in court next time. Judge Xiao questioned the two defendants and their confessions remained the same. He ordered them to be detained and the case continued to be verified.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The 30th Anniversary of the Opening of Huacheng Insurance Company <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Expanding Business, Moving to a New Building</p>
<p>Huacheng Insurance Company was founded in the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The founders, such as Zeng Shaoqing, Zhu Baosan, Yu Pinghan, Shen Manyun, Li Yunshu, Li Pingqi, Wang Yiting, Gu Xinyi, Mu Shuzai, and others, were all prominent figures in Shanghai at the time. They were aware of the development of foreign-owned insurance companies, the outflow of profits, and the increasing leakage of funds. They also believed that insurance was essential to the lives and property of the people and that Chinese people were often at a disadvantage due to a lack of understanding of insurance regulations. Therefore, they resolutely established the Huacheng Insurance Company, a completely Chinese-owned company, to protect profits and safeguard the property of their fellow countrymen, and to contribute to the development of Nanshi. They specially set up a shoe company outside the Malu Bridge. All sectors of Shanghai learned about the Chinese-owned insurance company and that its founders were the most reputable figures in the area. People flocked to take out insurance policies, and the business flourished. The first manager of the company was Mr. Huang Youlin, followed by Li Pingqing, Wen Nuzai, and Gu Xinyi, all of whom prioritized the well-being of the people. They were particularly prompt in settling claims and never made things difficult for customers. Huaxing, Huacheng, and Huaan Insurance Companies rose one after another, deeply gaining social trust and laying a solid foundation for the Chinese insurance industry. Subsequently, more Chinese insurance companies were established, and there are now more than twenty, enough to compete with foreign companies. Foreign-owned companies, seeing the rise of Chinese companies and their growing influence, engaged in price reductions and commission increases, leading to fierce competition. The company, observing the trend, had to change its approach and work hard. In May of this year, it convened a shareholders' meeting, re-elected directors and supervisors, and elected Zhang Zhuping as chairman of the board, Wang Yiting and Gu Xinyi as directors. Wan, Huang Xingjie, Sheng Zeheng, Dong Haoguang, Yu Ziqi, and Li Zhishi as directors, and Guo Fuyun and Liu Hengfu as supervisors. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the company's founding and to encourage future development, it was decided to expand the scope of business, including fire insurance, water insurance, automobile insurance, war risk insurance, and accident insurance. Branch offices and agencies were gradually established in various provinces and cities to attract business. The original headquarters was too small, so the company moved to 467 Jiangxi Road, and a reception was held on July 1 for all sectors to tour the premises.

<p>Ms. Yue'er, a famous Cantonese opera singer, is good at singing Pinghou, especially in expressing emotions, and has long been appreciated by the audience.

Now that Ms. Yue'er is passing through here on her way to Qingdao for summer vacation, the owner of Haizhu Theater on Fusheng Road learned about it and invited her to stay in the theater for three days to sing for those who love Yue'er's music. Famous Chinese and Western musicians are also invited to perform together. Ticket sales for the daytime and nighttime performances will begin on July 1.</p>

<h3 id="e186">China Youth Physical Education Department Organizes Water Polo Training Class <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The China Youth Physical Education Department is sparing no effort in promoting swimming. This swimming season, in addition to continuing to run summer swimming classes for students, it is also organizing a water polo training class, scheduled to start on the 6th of next month. In addition, the Cooperative Tennis Club, organized by members of the association, will also hold a get-together. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Water Polo Training Water polo is quite popular in Hong Kong and Guangdong. In Shanghai, only the Malta team had such an organization in the past. Even those who practice it have immature skills. Skilled water polo players must possess both wrestling and sprinting abilities. It is the most complete water sport in terms of strength, so learning water polo is more difficult than other ball sports and cannot be achieved overnight. This season, the China Youth Association has decided to open a water polo training class to cultivate talent in this area. The quota is twenty people, and many have already signed up. The training time will be arranged after the enrollment quota is met.</p>
<p>Lifesaving Training Lifesaving is a specialized skill, so those who are proficient in swimming may not be able to perform lifesaving and rescue. Necessary methods must be used. The association is establishing a lifesaving class this season, with a quota of twenty people. However, applicants must pass an exam and meet the following qualifications: (A) Able to swim freestyle, breaststroke, sidestroke, and backstroke (without using hands) for 40 yards continuously; (B) Able to jump into the water from a springboard; (C) Able to dive from a water surface eight feet deep and retrieve an eight-pound object. The association will also award medals to those who pass the exam upon completion of the course to encourage them.</p>
<p>Beginner Swimming Class This season's beginner swimming class has received a very enthusiastic response. Training is scheduled to start on the 6th of next month, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM at the association's swimming pool on Sichuan Road. This class is specifically designed for beginners and uses simple and quick methods to teach various swimming techniques. Each class has a quota of twenty-five people. A second class will be added when the quota is met.</p>
<p>Tennis Social Gathering The Cooperative Tennis Club, organized by members of the association, has about forty members this year. However, due to work commitments, the players are divided into morning and evening classes, and their schedules differ, making it difficult for team members to meet. To promote connections, the association has scheduled a social gathering game at the Luzon Road court next month on the 4th (Saturday) afternoon. A dinner is also planned at the Chengdu Restaurant that evening.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Exchange Rates Rise, US Dollar Market Hardens <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market saw rising exchange rates, a softening US dollar, a narrowing swap spread, and a weakening forward market. Early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London's large-sized contracts, both near and far term, rose by .0625. New York's silver market remained unchanged. Monterial's forward silver price remained unchanged and rose by 5 haos. London spot gold rose by 1.5 pence. The British pound rose by half a penny against the US dollar, and the British pound fell by 6 centimes against the French franc. The US dollar rose by 1.25 cents against the British pound, and the US dollar rose by 1 cent against the French franc. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound and the US dollar remaining unchanged. Customs gold units rose by 2 lis. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price for the British pound at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and .375, and the US dollar at 30.125 yuan, which was a neutral movement for the British pound and a softening of .09375 for the US dollar compared to the previous Saturday, due to the rising exchange rates. After the opening, banks still had sell orders. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound and the US dollar remaining unchanged, making it difficult for the overall trend to rise. After entering the market, the silver equalization tax was announced to be up 25. Banks' short covering was inconsistent, and there were many swap transactions, so the overall trend hovered. In the afternoon, market sentiment was cold, lacking large supply and demand, and transactions were scarce. The process gradually lacked changes, and there were no transactions until the end. At the closing, the near-term selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and .375, and the US dollar was 30.125 yuan, which was a neutral movement for the British pound and a softening of .09375 for the US dollar compared to the previous Saturday. The forward market saw weakening for both the British pound and the US dollar, because the swap spread narrowed, the Chinese merchants' demand was limited, banks still had sell orders, and foreign firms slightly increased their buying. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>The British pound rose, with the near-term selling price at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and .375. Macagary covered spot at .375, which was shorted by the Xin Feng Foreign Firm.

<h3 id="e216">Securities Public Bonds See Retail Investors Covering Shorts <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market conditions temporarily became dull due to the current situation. Retail investors covered their shorts, causing a slight increase. Although each trade showed a slight rise, it could not truly be considered a rising trend. One reason is that the situation in the Southwest is not without hope for peace. Observing the preparations of various parties, peace is still hanging by a thread. However, the situation in North China is especially urgent. Once it erupts, the scope will inevitably be wide. Another reason is that July 12 is the date for handling settlements, with a routine two-day holiday. Therefore, some floating shorts were closed out. Yesterday, from the opening bell to the closing bell in the afternoon, there was not much trading throughout the day. The market trend did not appear strong. When there were those raising prices to absorb, they were met with a flurry of selling. However, there was very little trading and sellers were not flooding the market. The long positions were somewhat cautious. Apart from the North Gang's Nos. 14 and 10 seeing slightly more trading, the rest was mainly retail investors covering shorts for activity. Observing the closing, various issues continued to rise, while Class B and Class A bonds appeared listless. Far-term Class A bonds even fell by five points, indicating that the future may still turn downwards. In this kind of adverse environment, a rise of several jiao or over one yuan is actually satisfying and unlikely to continue. The total turnover amounted to 5,585,000 yuan. The resulting rises and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e217">Yarn and Cotton: Trading Suspended for Two Days <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Many in the Yarn Market are Trying to Squeeze Direct</p>
<p>The yarn market is showing fatigue, with a mediocre situation. This is because the Da Gu Sanpin yarn market is declining, and at the same time, the sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly dull, causing morale to decline. In addition, the yarn and cotton market will be closed for two days starting tomorrow. As a result, both the long and short positions are trying to squeeze direct, and trading is very quiet, making market prices even more ordinary.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls Eight or Nine Jiao in Recent Months</p>
<p>In the standard yarn market's previous session, prices for all months showed signs of falling. Due to the unfavorable environment, the market atmosphere was extremely quiet and buyers were scarce. Prices for each month fell by seven or eight jiao to one yuan and two jiao. By the third session, some shorts covered their positions, rebounding by several jiao. As a result, each month fell by six to eight jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, the market atmosphere remained mediocre. It was heard that spot yarn trading was sluggish, and short positions aggressively entered the market in the third and third session. By the closing bell, it returned to calmness. As a result, the current month rose by one jiao compared to the morning closing price, while the rest fell by one yuan and three jiao. It was found that 1,500 bales of Hengyi, 1,550 bales of Dafeng, 2,800 bales of Mingde, 650 bales of Yichang, 650 bales of Xiesheng, 700 bales of Tonghe, and 700 bales of Xincheng were sold. 400 bales of Yuda, 600 bales of Tongji, 600 bales of Jifeng, 600 bales of Dafu, 650 bales of Daji, 1,600 bales of Shenji, 700 bales of Yuanyi, 950 bales of Dachangcheng, 850 bales of Changfeng, 1,650 bales of Fengtai, and 800 bales of Runkang were purchased. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Change from Previous Day  Account Balance (Bales)</p>
<p>July Future  202.0  201.5  202.0  Down 0.70  84,600</p>

<p>Total  634,700</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Only Exceed 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. It was found that the total transaction volume for all gangs throughout the day was 565 bales, with prices falling by five jiao to one yuan. The purchase volume of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland  125 Wuhu  10 Hankou  55 Changsha  170 Yunnan  60 Nanjing  10 Beiping  5 Xuzhou  10 Fellow Traders  25 Guangdong  5</p>
<p>Bank Settlement, Yarn Trading Suspended</p>
<p>July 1st and 2nd are the period for bank semi-annual settlements. Due to the yarn and cloth exchange's handling of silver receipts and payments, and because of settlement procedures, the standard yarn and cotton market will also be closed for two days. Normal trading and business will resume from the 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e218">This Month's Cotton Falls by More Than Half a Yuan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Cotton cloth is showing fatigue, and the long positions have made some settlements in the near term. It is said that coarse cotton velvet still lacks a considerable sales market, but fine cotton velvet is extremely scarce. As for new cotton, the recent climate has been favorable, and there are still many people selling. However, the US and Indian cotton markets remain strong.</p>
<p>Tongji Brand Standard Cotton Slightly Unloads</p>
<p>In the previous session of the standard cotton market, prices for all months fell uniformly, and the situation weakened. Because most cotton merchants tend to sell, it is rumored that the coarse cotton velvet taken in by the long positions is still being sold in large quantities. The short positions are actively moving, and Tongji brand cotton is slightly unloading. As a result, each month fell by two jiao to three and a half jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, each month remained ordinary. New sellers in the old market were not very enthusiastic. As a result, the current month fell another two jiao compared to the morning closing price, while the far months rose or fell by five points. It was found that 1,300 dan of Hexing, 1,900 dan of Zhenda, 2,100 dan of Jifeng, 1,800 dan of Tongji, 1,900 dan of Dachangcheng, 2,000 dan of Yikang, 2,400 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,900 dan of Yongda, 3,500 dan of Xinxing, and 1,200 dan of Yiyu were sold. 1,000 dan of Dafu, 2,900 dan of Juxing, 1,300 dan of Daji, 2,500 dan of Yuanyi, 1,300 dan of Yicheng, 3,500 dan of Jinghua, 1,800 dan of Fengtai, 2,100 dan of Shenji, and 1,200 dan of [missing name] were purchased. The high, low, and closing prices for January are listed below:</p>

<p>Bombay cotton industry, at the beginning of the week, followed the strong overseas momentum, and the market situation was strong. Later, fearing overseas reactions, long positions settled, showing a slight softening. Long positions sold off quite a bit at the peak, but there were also those who bought in on the dips. Japanese buyers bought a lot, except for Balaras. Local factories paid attention to western cotton. Along the western coast, it was reported that widespread and very beneficial rainfall was obtained.

<p>Cotton Cloth Trading Slightly Sluggish</p>
<p>Eastern Goods for the Next Month Already Available</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was due to yarn and cotton still trending downward. The current value is at the sixth bottom line for bank settlement, and it is also the period for piece goods futures margin payments for this month. Customer gang remittances were quite scarce, and goods arrivals were slack. Summer goods, due to the hot weather, are already like the third dog days of summer. Retail wholesale in stores immediately shrank. Scattered sales to customers were still not lonely. Tianjin gang imported over 200 bales of Yihua light-weight 11-pound three-rabbit coarse cloth and 12-pound three-rabbit coarse twill. Dafeng Dawei and other factory's Jingang Nei over 20 cases. This street and dyeing factories purchased over 200 pieces of Eastern Goods fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, etc., which were cheap plate sales at the end of the month, with prices falling by 2.5 fen per piece. Eastern Goods next month's futures have opened quite a bit, with factory plates slightly loosening by 2.5 to 5 fen. Color goods, the Four Gentlemen Serge sales are not strong, falling slightly by 1.25 li per yard. Goods from this factory are also gradually loosening, with 16-pound Hongfu Baoxing and other brands of coarse cloth falling by 2.5 fen per piece. Plain cotton cloth from Hunan and Hubei regions along the Yangtze River is in good demand. Hankou this factory's lower-grade fine cloth and fine twill are 60 to 70 pieces, and Hunan province also purchased 50 to 60 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Sales of Japanese Raincoat Fabric are Very Brisk <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Japanese raincoat fabric have been very active recently. The workshops in the city continue to have strong demand, and military uniform gangs and local customers also have great demand because a large number of rainy season uniforms continue to be ordered. Yesterday, eight cases of No. 1 double-sided Yuanchang gray twill floral yarn raincoat fabric were traded, with a price of one yuan and five fen. Twelve cases of Yuanchang gray twill floral surface plate silk bottoms were traded, with a price of eight and a half jiao.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, all months showed a uniform strong trend. With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was up 4/8 to 1/10, and Canada was up about 1/10 to 2/10. The opening price was favorable. The July issue had a good appetite from customer gangs, and morale was firm. Far-term months also saw good sentiment from outside the industry, and because the factories were shipping so few numbers, they had risen by one fen. Later, the long positions returned, with a slight drop. By the afternoon opening, the weather was muggy, and the arrival of wheat was inevitably hindered. Spot prices were also raised by three fen, causing morale to recover. Because the July issue can be drawn, such as the warship Lao Che, all added 1 jiao, and Shuangma added 5 fen, so people were more stable.

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, all months were unanimously high, because recent arrivals have decreased slightly, and the goods that have arrived are mostly purchased by traders. Due to cost considerations, they could not be killed too much. The production areas of Jiangnan and Jiangbei, due to the purchase of factories and traders, also appeared old and hard. Therefore, after opening, it was good by two or three fen.</p>
<p>Then it rose another two or three fen. By the afternoon opening, short positions were covering, and the stability of the flour market also brought up morale, which was up 7 to 8 fen compared to the previous week's closing price. The spot wheat market, because the factories are still healthy, and because the standard has increased sharply, all grades have been raised by 3 fen, with Linhuai Guan wheat opening at 4 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen, Qingjiangpu wheat at 4 yuan and 2 jiao, and lower quality wheat at 1 jiao and 9 fen. Hankou wheat opened at 4 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen, and lower quality wheat at 1 jiao. Huai'an wheat opened at 4 yuan and 2 jiao, and lower quality wheat at 1 jiao and 8 fen.

<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice continued to arrive from the Yangtze River. After the hot weather, merchants and hoarders planned to sell, but the buyers were watching. The market atmosphere was decadent. The only way out was the local street to deal with small needs. The Northern and Fujian gangs stopped buying. The inland gang had only 200 to 300 packages of Jiangxi Zhongguan rice traded. Otherwise, no one inquired. In this sluggish and sluggish state, it is difficult for the owners to depreciate the price to boost sales. As a result, high rice was a small angle, and medium to lower grades were nearly 2 jiao. The total daily sales included 1,263 packages of Jiangxi rice, 200 packages of Xiang rice, and 650 packages of Yong rice.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Street Sales of Thick Early Japonica are Still Brisk <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source of supply from various gangs was similar to before, still arriving at Nos. 34 and 35, with a total of more than 7,000 stone. Local street sales were slightly active due to the end of the month, so the market for thick early japonica was tight. Thin rice was flat, with the Baowei Da Qinhuangdao two gangs only buying over 500 packages. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were not particularly glorious or disgraceful.</p>
<h3 id="e227">New Broad Beans of High Quality Are Firm and Stable <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Although the source of new broad beans has been continuous recently, they are drier than when they first entered the market, so the market price has declined. As a result, sellers are unwilling to sell lightly. Most powerful sellers have tightened up the market unanimously, so the market for high-quality goods has been able to stabilize, and the market conditions have also occupied one or two points fresh. Medium-grade goods are still weak. Yesterday's transaction was sluggish due to continuous drizzle, and sales were not surging. It is estimated that 800 packages of Jiading white broad beans, 250 packages of Chongming sand broad beans, and 130 packages of Maojia City green broad beans were opened, all of which were purchased by the Tianjin and Dongyang gangs.</p>

<p>—Up Three or Four Jiao from Before—</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market had public plate allocations. If the 24th coarse sand is still 22 yuan, 1 jiao, transshipment is 6 yuan, 8 jiao, with a slight amount of making. The bidding price for No. 489 Dongbai did not move. The factory's cotton white, Dahua Jinxin Factory No. 1 was 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and Zhenji Factory was 20 yuan and 3 jiao, which also changed. Yesterday, Zesha Danni imported a batch of cargo with coarse sand of 2,006 packages, counting 50 tons under Tianxiang's name, 50 tons of Shunquanlong, 100 tons of Dachang. In the numbers, the Chaozhou gang offered more than 200 packages of genuine cotton red, with prices from 12 yuan, 6 jiao to 12 yuan, 5 jiao, which is up 3 or 4 jiao. The market picture is firm. More than 200 packages of newly arrived Huanggang green were offered, with a price of 10 yuan and 2 jiao, and dozens of packages of Zhiyang, 13 yuan, 6 jiao and 5 fen. The Jian gang offered more than 700 packages of Anhaitang, with white sugar prices from 15 yuan, 6 jiao to 14 yuan, and red sand at 12 yuan. Currently, because sales have not been smooth, the future market will be determined.</p>
<p>The joint venture company had its first bid settlement period this week. The total fixed amount of Guangdong coarse sand, cotton white, etc. was 6,881 packages. The bid price remained the same. Mingde Factory sold 850 packages of Wuyang coarse white at 21 yuan, 6 jiao, Dongguan Factory sold another 260 packages at 21 yuan, 5 jiao, Quxi Factory sold another 30 packages at 21 yuan, 3 jiao, No. 2 cotton white at 90 packages, 20 yuan, 6 jiao, No. 4 cotton white at 30 packages, 20 yuan, 4 jiao, medium sand white at 19 yuan, 3 jiao, not sold.</p>

<p>According to Reuters telegrams, yesterday's fixed price of iron from 会司Hui Si has risen to seven gold yuan and six jiao per box, an increase of three jiao from the previous price. In terms of transactions, because Japanese purchases are very enthusiastic, most of the shipments are bought up, resulting in very few goods coming to China. Based on the small amount of incoming goods, the thin inventory, and the strong market atmosphere, local industry sources sold each box of old steel factory goods at 35 yuan, which is 2 yuan better than before. New steel factory goods sold for 34 yuan, and wild chicken goods sold for 33 yuan, 5 jiao, all of which were more than 1 yuan better than before. Many factories were purchasing. Due to the impact of the current situation, there was no major movement for customers.</p>

<p>(No. 24) Yesterday, thick tinplate was purchased by military factories and machinery factories. The market was very strong due to the thin inventory. For example, No. 30-inch and 36-inch goods (50 sheets per box) sold for 120 yuan, which is 5 yuan better than before, and each sheet sold for 3 yuan. The deputy numbered goods (i.e., small-sized ones) were sold for 1 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao per sheet. It was found that there were as many as 20 to 30 boxes offered on the market yesterday. It was found that the arrival of goods was extremely small, so the market situation was glorious.</p>
<p>(No. 26) The recent market is also quite good. The inventory has been reduced, although [missing word] has revived, [missing word] prices have risen, and each box is offered at 100 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than before.

Lyon Shanghai silk A-character 13.22 per base still sold for 72.5 francs, and B-character also maintained the original price, at 63 francs. Yokohama spot goods were sold for 715 yuan, the same as last week's market price, and futures were 723 yuan, which was a drop of 2 yuan. Transactions in this port's silk business were not enthusiastic. Yesterday, Renna Foreign Firm made a slight purchase.</p>

<p>The market price for No. 120 No. 2 Sini Ai's shiny man-made silk is 110 yuan per stack, and only 395 yuan including tax, which is still more than 10 yuan [missing] than the Tianqiao brand. Yesterday, several netting factories in this port purchased more than 20 cases of tax-paid goods. Sales of the No. 120 Tianqiao brand have cooled, with only more than 10 cases traded, and the price is still 410 yuan. No. 120 No. 4 [missing] Shilong shiny, the stack price is only 80 yuan, which is quite popular with netting factories, but the current inventory has been exhausted, and no transactions have been made by Japanese and European foreign firms.</p>

<p>Yuan Shixi's Asking Price is also High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market became active again. The sales of drawn-core precious eyebrows from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas to Europe became smoother. Tongfu Jinlong Yongxing Baochang and most other traders have made large purchases, and transactions are booming. The top price offered was 140 yuan. However, there were no large transactions of precious eyebrows from Shexian Yushan and other areas. The reputation of Gaoyangshi green tea from Wuyuan [missing name] is also good among white-head traders. The price of the Ti Zhuang goods offered was 95 yuan, and the price of ordinary goods offered was 65 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than last year.

However, the market for floral fragrance is still brisk. It is heard that a large number will be listed today.</p>

<p>2 World Sugar Prices</p>
<p>Looking at the sugar prices over the past six years, they have been getting worse and worse. From 13.5 Dutch bonds in 1929, to 3.5 last year, it has fallen by more than three-quarters! However, the sugar prices for the whole of last year did not fall much, remaining between three and four shields.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this agreement, the expert Chadourne made many efforts, but the result was such that all the countries expired one after another (European countries in August and September last year, Peru, Cuba in December last year, Java in March this year). Recently, there has been an intention to expand the organization, but it is still feared that there will not be much cooperative effect.</p>

<p>Europe As for last year's world sugar production, in Europe. Except for Jack and the United Kingdom, which still suffered losses due to insufficient rainfall, most other countries were also reducing in general.

<p>—(Rong Yu)</p>
<p>"Reading sound, weaving sound, child crying sound." In the old days, having these three sounds was considered an auspicious omen for the family. Modern families are different now, and they constantly have "radio broadcast sounds, mahjong clicking sounds, and the sound of wives and concubines scolding." Are these three sounds good or bad? I still need to ask the readers to comment.</p>
<p>People in the past said, "If you can bite into the vegetable root, then everything can be done." This was to encourage people to "endure the bitterness of the bitter, and then become a person above people." Nowadays, unless disaster victims have nothing to eat, they are willing to bite into vegetable roots. Otherwise, once they get a little success, they want to be rich and honored, and they are not willing to put effort into these little things!</p>
<p>Buying tickets at the theater, getting on and off transportation, we Chinese people habitually "do not give way to righteousness, but rush to be first." If we put this courage on the battlefield, foreigners would definitely retreat three times.</p>
<p>Robbers are indeed hateful, but he doesn't rob others, but he robs you, and you also have a place to attract misfortune. If you don't know how to improve yourself, but complain that people are barbaric and unreasonable, I ask if this grievance can move God, and know how to win? If you know that it can't, it's better not to complain, but to bury your head in hard work.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Sunlight <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>The sun unconditionally casts its light, and mankind on Earth unconditionally absorbs sunlight. This seems like the fairest thing in the world. But while this statement is perfectly reasonable in the countryside, in this, the only metropolis in the East, a question mark, shaped like an ear, should be added to it.</p>
<p>In the countryside, on vast farms, with only three thatched cottages standing alone, as long as the weather is clear, regardless of heat or cold, from the moment the sun rises from the horizon until it sets again, the sunlight bathes every part of the surroundings. The people in the thatched cottages can fully enjoy the immeasurable heat and the germ-killing power, as scientists call it, within the sunlight.</p>
<p>But in our metropolis, sunlight is considered a highly precious commodity. For houses of the same size, the front building facing south is always twice as expensive as the rear building facing north, because the southern one can enjoy or at least see sunlight throughout the year, while the northern one has no chance to be in contact with sunlight at all. Similarly, on a three-story building, one with a skylight on the roof is surely eight dimes or one dollar more expensive per month than one without, because sunlight shines through the skylight.</p>
<p>According to foreigners' investigations, in lane houses, there are cases where seven or eight families live behind a single stone-framed gate, and some of them never receive any sunlight throughout the year. This is very inappropriate in terms of hygiene. These words are correct from a hygienic standpoint, but how can those foreigners living in Western-style houses with gardens understand that in this city, sunlight is a luxury that one has to pay a high price for, and that not everyone has the right to enjoy it? Therefore, in general lane houses, the competition for a place on the drying platform often becomes the focal point of conflict among cohabitants, because the supply of sunlight is too scarce, and it is too precious.</p>
<p>I once had a foolish idea: to put the inexpensive sunlight from the countryside into bottles, or boxes, or some other kind of container, and transport it to the city to sell. But on second thought, this is somewhat pointless, because people who can't afford to live in a house with sunlight probably don't have spare money to buy sunlight to enjoy either.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Bean Curd Labor <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>Grinding bean curd is one of the three most arduous jobs under heaven; everyone acknowledges that. In fact, among the three, blacksmithing and rowing boats are somewhat better. They work during the day and can sleep peacefully in bed at night, dreaming good dreams. One night of rest restores their spirit and strength. Only the bean curd workers truly suffer! Working during the day is not the main issue; it's that they must strain themselves in the dark midnight, "glug, glug," working frantically. In summer nights, mosquitoes swarm all over their bodies, foul odors fill their nostrils, sweating profusely, swatting mosquitoes and scratching itches. Winter nights are even worse, needless to say. They are jolted out of a good sleep, climb out of a warm bed, teeth chattering, a lamp flickering dimly, the bellows "crack-crack," the millstone "glug-glug," together forming a twisted labor song.</p>
<p>It's said: Although the trade is lowly, the profits are substantial. In the past, there were the "wine vat," "dye vat," and "bean curd vat," known as "hidden door" businesses. Now other businesses are experiencing economic downturns, but bean curd shops are still doing well, indicating that their profits are indeed high! Overseas Chinese in Paris, known as the "Three Heroes of Bean Curd," have actually accumulated vast fortunes through this smelly business. Who would have thought that this small, lowly trade could become famous abroad!</p>
<p>Others say: Bean curd shop owners certainly have it good, but pity those bean curd workers. Their work is heavy, and their pay is low. It truly only prevents starvation. If you don't believe me, look at their bodies; aren't they all broken and worn out, like living beggars!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Three: The Rain and Slanting Wind Leave Traces; In the Still Night, a Letter of Severance is Written.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, he reached out his snow-white hand to hold back the rain curtain and stretched his head outside. The slanting wind blew raindrops onto his face, but he didn't seem to mind, his eyes fixed forward. Guoshi saw him and made a slight nod of acknowledgement. He was not so wooden and unmoved; he smiled faintly at Guoshi. The rickshaw puller thought the female student sitting in his cart must be eager to get home, so he pulled the cart quickly. Therefore, the time the two faced each other was extremely short. At that moment, Guoshi didn't even have time to smile a second time, let alone speak. It rained again for three days, and he always sat in the cart. On the fourth day, the weather was very sunny. Thinking that he would be walking today, he mustered up one hundred and twenty percent of his courage. He felt that he had been too timid in the past. As a man, if he didn't even dare to ask a friend's name, he might as well not bother with social interactions. Fortunately, he had already figured out how to start a conversation. Now he just needed to practice his delivery. Upon seeing him, he must not panic, and naturally not be shy. He would stand firm, give a deep nod, and then say, "Miss, we see each other every day, we're quite familiar. May I ask for your esteemed surname?" She would certainly stop, smile, and say, "You are too kind." Then, she would generously give her name. This time, he could only take the conversation this far. Anything more would have to wait for next time. Having made up his mind, as he walked into the lane where they usually met that morning, his heart began to race. By the time the person walked in front of him, his face was flushed. Not only could he not speak, he even forgot the slight nod he usually gave. He simply lowered his head and walked past. By the time the person had walked far away, he regretted it, but it was too late to make amends. Because he had acted somewhat flustered that time, he dared not attempt it that afternoon. The next day, he rallied his courage again. As he left home, his feet felt particularly firm on the ground, and each step was louder, as if he were demonstrating his resolve. When he reached the lane, he peeked at the approaching young lady from afar. Her attire was neat, but her face was cast downward, as if she was angry. "Is she angry at me?" "Slow down, slow down, I can't take the risk today. There's plenty of time, I'll wait for an opportunity." So, in this hesitation, another four or five days passed. However, things were a bit different during these four or five days. Sometimes he would see her, sometimes not. (41)</p>

<h3 id="e240">On the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>I had long wanted to make a pilgrimage to several highways, but due to lack of opportunity, I finally shelved this concern, and gradually forgot it.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in order to investigate the living conditions in the countryside, I revived that forgotten impulse. In a hazy, moonlit morning, in a new model silver car, I climbed onto that long, winding highway.</p>
<p>We departed from Sichuan Road, passing through a corner of the metropolis, which was still asleep. Later, we went out from Zhabei, passed the Sun Temple. The horn roared like a beast, the car flew like lightning, and we quickly left behind some shacks and some working people. What appeared before us was a vast and boundless plain.</p>
<p>The sky gradually brightened. Some places were sprinkled with a layer of lovely golden sunlight. A morning breeze, tinged with the scent of the season, poked its head in through the car window, lightly kissing my face. My heart was filled with excitement and joy!</p>
<p>After the car passed Zhenru, it was like a small, unmoored boat in the sea of nature, speeding along the highway. The car body shook like a small boat in the waves. The scents of wheat and flowers, carried by the lonely morning breeze, reminded me that it was the season for reaping wheat and sowing seeds.</p>
<p>Advancing towards the depths of the plain, many fields and paths flashed past my eyes clearly and vaguely. Near the railway, I could see the third and fourth-class passenger trains departing from Shanghai, rushing forward like terrible beasts. The rumbling sound shook the earth, and sharp cries sliced through the solidified sky, causing the still air to tremble.</p>
<p>Puffs of black smoke, like blackened cotton wads, were spewed out from the "dragon head," abandoned in the sky, drifting in the suburbs—</p>
<p>In the fields, there were already scattered farmers working: men and women, some standing ploughing the soil, some bending over reaping wheat and pulling beans, and some already transplanting rice in the shallow paddy fields.</p>
<p>Villages, fields, bridges... all slipped past my eyes. Two hours later, that gray, ancient city wall lay before me like a dead snake. Soon, I ordered the car to stop at Xinlumen. I looked at my watch. It was exactly seven o'clock, and the Shanghai Daily Public Association's newspaper delivery car had already arrived in Suzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Seaside Sketch <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>"Going to the sea?!"</p>
<p>Bare-legged, carrying fishing gear, a group went towards the Yellow Sea. They are fishermen who catch cicada larvae and depend entirely on the Yellow Sea for their livelihood. Because they don't have money to build seagoing boats, they catch cicada larvae on the beach to sell in the city.</p>
<p>They understand the tides. After the tide recedes, the cicada larvae are all on the beach, making them easy to catch. Each person squats down, toes sinking into the mud, a smile on their face, catching cicada larvae and throwing them into their fishing baskets, singing a tune without rhythm. Many footprints float on the beach.</p>
<p>"Rumble! Rumble!"</p>
<p>Two black oxen, pulling a cart, go into the sea. A fisherman sits on the back of the ox, and the cart is piled high with fishing nets. This is a Shanghai boat, preparing to fish when the tide comes tomorrow.</p>
<p>The desolate beach is dotted with a few thatched huts. The soil turns a layer of snow-white salt after being exposed to the sunlight. The white, vast water seems to connect to the sky. Only a few sea boats are parked in the sea, and some are stranded on the beach. One can still see ox carts moving in the water. How fierce the sea breeze is! Standing there is somewhat swaying, and the heads of the fishermen on the beach are wriggling. "Going to the market!"</p>
<p>The fishing baskets are filled with cicada larvae. They stand up and run, there are still fifteen li to Changsha. Several legs quickly pass by, still estimating the value of the cicada larvae in the fishing baskets, fifty coppers (note), eighty coppers, but not more than one hundred coppers.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Reading Paintings in Cun Tian Ge <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yinquan</p>
<p>Mr. Hai Su is about to exhibit several hundred of his masterpieces to the nation in Shanghai. Through the introduction of Shao Hou, I was fortunate to get a preview in Cun Tian Ge.</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to Western painting, and although the Pavilion is filled with a dazzling array of paintings, I initially dared not utter a word. But after seeing his "Yellow Mountain" and "Withered Lotus" works, I was struck by how he used passionate oil paints to express the elegant and unrestrained spirit of traditional Chinese painting. His creative power and freedom are compelling.</p>
<p>The Pavilion owner's earlier traditional Chinese paintings were mostly bold and vigorous in brush and ink, uninhibited and unrestrained. Their majestic spirit and unrestrained emotions leapt off the paper, daring one to look up. The new works have a slightly different style, moving from majesty to inner refinement, from unrestrained to rigorous and precise. Because he has cultivated deeply and accumulated richly, he can, like one who tames the sea, clearly distinguish and arrange; like one who washes snow and chews ice, return to purity and integrity; and like one whose work is effortless, return to nature.</p>
<p>The Pavilion owner discussed Chinese painting with me, saying: "Buddhism came to the East and, influenced by it, art greatly advanced. However, throughout the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang dynasties, it was subordinate to Buddhism and dominated by India. It was not until the great masters Wu Daozi, Li Sixun, and Wang Wei emerged in the flourishing Tang dynasty that they revitalized their genius, based it on themselves, and created an independent and great Chinese style of painting. During the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan dynasties, talented individuals emerged, and their art reached its peak. However, since the Ming and Qing dynasties, it has steadily declined. The Northern School became the court style, and further declined into rigid and formulaic boundary painting. The Southern School became literati painting, and further declined into the mediocrity of the Four Wangs. In modern times, Western winds have gradually spread eastward, and art has followed. Those who follow the Four Wangs are parochial and cherish their broken brooms. Those who are obsessed with Western painting show off any small achievement, disdaining national traditions. They do not realize that art is the highest expression of the self's spirit and must uphold the spirit of the great masters of the flourishing Tang dynasty, taking the self of this time and place as the center, and the strengths of ancient Europe and the West as the basis, in order to complete the independent personality of Chinese painting."</p>
<p>I have only just begun to glimpse the doorway to painting, but based on the Pavilion owner's views and my own intuition, the advantage of Chinese painting lies in the "comprehensive expression of the combination of real objects and concise impressions." Objects are concrete nature, and impressions are abstract concepts. It begins with observation, continues with editing, and ends with self-expression. The ability of Chinese painting is exhausted. Therefore, Chinese painting initially does not have the divisions of realism, romanticism, and symbolism like Western painting. However, within the six principles of Chinese painting, the spirit of each school is almost entirely included. Speaking of realism, it is not simply copying objects like Western sketching, but observing with the eyes, storing it in the spirit, and when the interest comes, the scene is created with a brush. Speaking of symbolism, it is not simply imagining and writing about a heavenly kingdom, but taking the magnificence of the Five Mountains and comprehensively expressing them on a small canvas. For example, when painting a beauty, one takes the beauty of Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun and comprehensively expresses it in one person. This kind of expressive technique is not realistic or symbolic, but the comprehensive expression of forging nature. Specifically speaking, like writing about clouds and mountains, the intention is to possess the strengths of each school, making it even more attractive. I observed that the Pavilion owner's realistic and freehand masterpieces were almost all able to utilize their superb skills to develop the inherent spirit of Chinese painting. Even when painting a humble myna bird, he kept ten myna birds and observed their sleeping, eating, flying, and singing postures every day, storing them in his mind. Once the brush and ink arrived, they could exhaust their spirit. If he were to simply take a myna bird and copy it, even if he could obtain the truth of its feathers, it would be difficult to obtain its flying spirit, truly becoming a dead myna bird.</p>
<p>However, Chinese painting is not without shortcomings. Speaking of laws and regulations, it does not have the proportions and perspective of the realist school. Speaking of emotions, it does not have the passionate abandon of the romantic school. Besides this, such as the positive significance of content and the optimistic emotions of color and ink, one must take the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Waiting for Medicine—Talking about Shasha Medicine Water <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>The term "waiting for medicine" is not found in records. I remember when I was studying zoology, birds that migrate with the seasons are called migratory birds; insects that are produced in response to the seasons are called seasonal insects. The orioles and swallows herald the coming of spring; the crickets chirp, lamenting the arrival of autumn; external objects show people so deeply, like this.</p>
<p>After finishing my rounds, feeling bored, I leafed through the newspapers and saw advertisements for Ten Drops Water, Shasha Medicine Water, etc., in various colors, catching my eye. Now I know that as the cold goes and the heat comes, the hot summer season is upon us again. The medicine appears according to the season, and the season is made clear by the medicine, so it is called waiting for medicine. Who says it is not appropriate?</p>
<p>There are many names for these types of medicines. For example, let me list them: Baoan Water, Epidemic Crisis Medicine Water, Shen Gong Jizhong Water, Emergency Epidemic Shasha Medicine Water, Jisheng Ten Drops Water, Yixin Water, Duoming Water, Puji Medicine Water, Divine Water, Supreme Saint Water, Emergency Shasha Syndrome Medicine Water, etc., totaling no less than several hundred. Today, the popularity of Ten Drops Water is such that even in remote rural areas, it can be seen. This is because it contains anesthetics and stimulants, easily pleasing people, firstly. The price is low, and the poor can afford it, secondly. Philanthropists do good deeds, purchasing it to distribute, making for powerful promotion, thirdly.</p>
<p>Our people's intelligence is shallow, and they have always followed the crowd, easily susceptible to bewitchment, creating the strange phenomenon of blindly believing in Ten Drops Water today. During the summer and autumn, ordinary people from all levels of society, whenever they feel unwell, have abdominal pain, diarrhea, or other early-stage heat-related illnesses, often call it Shasha, and use it to treat themselves in addition to scraping. If these symptoms disappear after a considerable period, it is attributed to the effect of Ten Drops Water. If it is ineffective, no blame is taken.</p>
<p>The ingredients of these medicines are mostly not produced domestically. After the opening of the seaports, Western medical techniques were introduced to China and came along with it. However, it is impossible to determine who created the formula or when it was manufactured. According to inspection reports, of the 53 types of Shasha Medicine Water examined in Shanghai, about six out of ten contained narcotics and other poisons, and four out of ten did not contain poisons. (See the annual report of the Central Health Laboratory in 1930) In essence, it is nothing more than the following medicines, added, subtracted, or changed.</p>
<p>1. Opium Wine</p>
<p>2. Datura Wine</p>
<p>3. Compound Rhubarb Wine</p>
<p>4. Camphor Wine</p>
<p>5. Capsicum Wine</p>
<p>6. Valerian Wine</p>
<p>7. Peppermint Wine</p>
<p>In terms of medicinal effects, opium wine has the effect of relieving pain and stopping diarrhea, with significant efficacy. The rest are stimulants, cardiotonics, stomachics, and sedatives. This mixture of medicines is more suitable for simple abdominal pain and diarrhea caused by excessive peristalsis (such as those caused by cold stimulation of the abdomen). Those that do not contain narcotics can be used for fainting due to heat, with no objections. As for true cholera, dysentery, acute gastroenteritis, and diarrhea caused by food accumulation, it is harmful and useless to use. Diarrhea is a symptom, not a disease source, and the first priority should be to clear and guide. If the goal is only to stop diarrhea, and an anti-diarrheal containing opium is used in the early stages, it will cause the bacteria to remain in the intestines for a long time, causing great harm. For those with severe and frequent diarrhea, this Ten Drops Water is powerless. Those who are anxious to seek treatment often take excessive amounts, resulting in acute opium poisoning. It is even easier for children to be poisoned because children are more sensitive to opium. There are also those who rely on Shasha Medicine Water and refuse to seek medical treatment immediately, missing the opportunity for treatment, which is even more detrimental.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what kind of Shasha Medicine Water it is, it has no place in medical treatment. Pure doctors do not have this item in their medicine bags or medicine cabinets.</p>

<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>In recent years, diseases of the heart and blood vessels have been increasing and have become the most serious national disease. This is because the causes of this disease are numerous and complex, and early recognition of the disease is quite difficult. Furthermore, with the advancement of society and the increasing complexity of human affairs, as well as the growing number of hobbies, all of these factors contribute to the disease developing unconsciously.</p>
<p>The heart is not an independent organ; it is the central point of the entire circulatory system. Therefore, the heart and blood vessels are closely related. Heart disease can originate from diseases of the heart itself, or it can arise from diseases of the blood vessels, such as when the flow of blood encounters resistance that the heart cannot overcome. Consequently, countries around the world are increasingly advancing their research on circulatory and heart diseases, emphasizing both equally.</p>
<p>The increase in heart disease is a common phenomenon, a national and international problem, as Vogl concluded. At the end of the 19th century, in the Bavarian region of Germany, the number of soldiers retiring due to circulatory diseases more than doubled. In the Prussian army, the number of retirees nearly tripled. Similar phenomena occurred in Switzerland. Furthermore, the United States Public Health Service reported a significant increase in heart and kidney diseases since 1892, while the total number of deaths decreased gradually. Of particular note is that in 1931, there were 28 deaths per 10,000 residents due to circulatory diseases, compared to only 21 in 1905. Another startling statistic (from 1931) is as follows:</p>
<p>Out of Every Hundred Deaths</p>
<p>Seven deaths were due to tuberculosis</p>
<p>Ten point nine deaths were due to circulatory diseases</p>
<p>The incidence of these diseases is mostly found between the ages of forty and sixty. Higher-level professionals in large cities are at particularly high risk. For example, among physicians in Vienna, 34.25% suffered from circulatory diseases, while only 15.84% of the general population did. Recently in our country, the deaths of Mr. Hu Zhantang and former院长 Tan (former hospital director Tan) were largely due to circulatory diseases. From what I have seen in magazines and newspapers, deaths due to these diseases are reported almost daily. Therefore, a correct understanding of circulatory diseases and their early diagnosis is not only the greatest effort of our physicians today, but also something that those who generally care about their health should pay attention to, taking precautions before it is too late.</p>
<p>Last spring, I went to Europe to investigate new medicine and visited the Naheim Spa in Germany, the most famous heart sanatorium in all of Europe, where many heads of state and nobles from various countries go to recuperate. The scenery there is beautiful, like a paradise. The establishment of the Heart Research Institute there is particularly world-renowned. The most important tool for studying this disease is the Flek trocardiograph. When the human body is at rest and there are no other muscle movements, only the heart's function generates an electrical current. We guide this current to both ends of the human body and amplify it. The movement passes through an extremely fine filament, and due to the strong electromagnetic force, it oscillates. We use a microscope to magnify the shadow of this movement onto a photographic paper strip, which is what we call an electrocardiogram. We all know that the heart's movement occurs automatically due to a specific stimulus. The center of this stimulus and the nerve conduction pathway run from the atrium to the ventricle. If there is any disruption to this regular movement, whether it is in the front, back, left, or right of the heart, we can use this automatic test to make an accurate diagnosis. However, this machine is not only expensive but also extremely complex in its construction. Even in those countries, only research institutes have this equipment. Given the backwardness of our society's knowledge, it is naturally viewed as mysterious and people are hesitant to try it. In fact, this machine is not only useful for diseases of the heart itself but also for circulatory diseases, such as arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure. Furthermore, symptoms of heart weakness caused by kidney disease, diabetes, acute infectious diseases, lung disease, and alcohol or opium addiction can all be diagnosed using this machine to determine the degree of the condition. Additionally, before performing major surgery or after administering cardiotonic drugs, if one wants to observe the changes in heart function, whether surgery can be performed, and the efficacy of the drugs, this machine is indispensable for such diagnoses. Although my knowledge is limited and I have this equipment, the progress of all research depends on the assistance of my colleagues, which I hope they will be happy to provide.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>What is acute yellow liver atrophy?</p>
<p>This is a rare disease in which fatty degeneration occurs in the liver parenchyma. Its triggers are syphilis, acute infectious diseases, and poisoning by toxins.</p>
<p>Which infectious diseases can trigger this disease?</p>
<p>Infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, relapsing fever, and smallpox can all trigger this disease.</p>
<p>Which toxins can trigger this disease?</p>
<p>Poisoning by substances such as Salvarsan, 606, 914, and poisonous mushrooms can trigger this condition. Does the occurrence of acute yellow liver atrophy relate to gender or age?</p>
<p>It mostly affects pregnant women and postpartum women between the ages of thirty and forty.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of this disease?</p>
<p>The symptoms can be divided into two stages.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of the first stage?</p>
<p>The symptoms of the first stage are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Pain in the liver area, followed by jaundice. This stage usually lasts from a few days to two weeks.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of the second stage?</p>
<p>The symptoms of the second stage are severe neurological symptoms, including severe headaches, restlessness, insomnia, delirium, convulsions, drowsiness, and coma. At the same time, the liver shrinks, and after several days, it shrinks to half or a quarter of its normal size. The spleen, however, is often enlarged. Severe jaundice also develops, and bleeding is seen in the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, etc.</p>
<p>Are there changes in the patient's urine?</p>
<p>The urine contains bile pigments and bile fluids, the amount of urea decreases, and sometimes a small amount of protein is seen. It contains specific Leucin and Tyrosin.</p>
<p>Are there changes in the stool?</p>
<p>The stool is constipated and clay-like. The pulse is rapid, ranging from 120 to 140 beats per minute.</p>
<p>How much higher than normal is the patient's body temperature during this period?</p>
<p>Most patients develop a moderate fever. Before death, the temperature rises to 39 or 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>What changes occur in the patient's blood?</p>
<p>The number of red blood cells in the blood increases, and the hemoglobin rises. The number of white blood cells also increases.</p>
<p>How is this disease diagnosed?</p>
<p>Early diagnosis is very difficult. It should be differentiated from duodenal jaundice, acute phosphorus poisoning, and Wilson's disease.</p>
<p>What is the prognosis?</p>
<p>Absolutely poor. It is invariably fatal within two to three weeks of onset.</p>
<p>How is acute yellow liver atrophy treated?</p>
<p>Only insulin and glucose injections are used. If syphilis is present, anti-syphilitic treatment can be administered. (End)</p>

<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Pedaliaceae (Sesame Family)</p>
<p>Sesamum indicum L. (Sesame)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to India and Egypt, cultivated in gardens, an annual herb. Stems are quadrangular, up to 1 meter tall, densely covered with short hairs. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, oblong or lanceolate, edges wavy, apex acute. Lower leaves often trifoliate. In summer, small white or light purple flowers bloom from the leaf axils; corolla tubular, 5-lobed. Capsules cylindrical, containing black or white seeds.</p>
<p>(Raw Drug) Sesame Seed (Semen Sesami) is collected from the mature seeds. The seeds are oval, tapering at one end, slightly flattened, 3-4 mm long, 1-1.5 mm thick, surface black or white, with a mild oily taste.</p>
<p>(Constituents) Seeds contain 45-55% fatty oil. Fatty acid composition (%) of sesame oil is as follows:</p>
<p>Oleic acid 48.1 Linolsaure 36.8 Palmitinsaure 7.7</p>
<p>Stearinsaure 4.6 Arachinsaure 0.4 Lignocerinsaure 0.04</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Sesame Oil (Oleum Sesami) can be used as a base for ointments. It can be used to prepare ammonia liniment, camphor ointment, simple ointment, etc.</p>
<p>(Other Uses) Used as edible oil and for manufacturing artificial butter.</p>
<p>Bignoniaceae (Trumpet Creeper Family)</p>
<p>Catalpa ovate, G. Don (O. KAempferi, Siebet Zucc.) (Chinese Catalpa)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to China, can be cultivated everywhere, a deciduous tree. Leaves long-petiolate, broadly heart-shaped, edges generally wavy, often deeply lobed, apex acute, glabrous on the underside. Pale yellow bell-shaped flowers bloom in early summer. Capsules narrow and linear.</p>
<p>American Catalpa (C. bignonioides, Walt), native to North America, similar to the previous species, underside of leaves densely covered with soft hairs, flowers white, capsules shorter and larger than the previous species.</p>
<p>Catalpa wood is of excellent quality, traditionally known as the "King of Woods." Annotation in the Compendium of Materia Medica states: "Catalpa is the leader of all trees, hence it is called the King of Woods." Its wood is of superior quality, unmatched by any other. The characters carved on woodblocks are called zi, and the emperor's coffin is called zigong, because it is a good material. There is a popular saying that planting this tree can prevent lightning strikes. Luo Yuan's Erya Yi states, "If this tree is in the house, the other materials will not be struck by lightning."</p>
<p>(Raw Drug) Catalpa Fruit (Fructus Cotalpae), collected from the fruits. The fruits are narrow and linear, about 40 cm long, about 0.5 cm wide, often splitting along the ventral suture. Surface dark brown, texture rough and easily broken, containing many seeds. Seeds wing-shaped, seed coat with many hairs, easily dispersed. Taste slightly astringent.</p>
<p>(Constituents) Fruits contain citric acid and its alkali salts. The diuretic effect of this raw drug is partly attributed to these substances. Its aqueous extract (Extractum) contains 14.16% ash, most of which is alkali salts (K 23-27% in the ash).</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old accounts: Catalpa fruit has a significant diuretic effect.</p>
<p>Prescription Example: Catalpa Fruit Decoction, used to treat edema.</p>
<p>Catalpa Fruit (6.0) 200.</p>
<p>Administer above dose in three divided doses per day.</p>
<p>Scrophulariaceae (Figwort Family)</p>
<p>Rehmannia glutinosa Mhosch arw purpurea, Makino (Chinese Foxglove)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to China, can be cultivated everywhere, a perennial herb. Stems up to 30 cm tall, whole plant densely covered with short hairs. Root leaves basal, stem leaves alternate, petiolate, oblong, edges uneven, serrated with blunt tips, surface wrinkled. Terminal raceme, with red labiate flowers blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>White-Flowered Rehmannia (R. glutinosa, Libosch, var, lutea, Makino). Shape smaller than the previous species, leaves generally basal, flowers pale yellowish-white.</p>
<p>(Cultivation Method) On a sloping hillside, create longitudinal strips, one foot apart, with five-inch drainage ditches between them. In late June, divide the roots stored from the previous year into one-inch pieces, plant each piece three inches apart. Fertilizers include bean cake, basal fertilizer, etc. Harvest the roots from late November to January, brush off the soil, dry them, and store them in sand. Each mu (unit of area) yields approximately 200 jin (unit of weight) of fresh roots.</p>
<p>(Raw Drug) Rehmannia Root (Rhizoma Rehmanniae), collected from the rhizomes of the above two species. White-flowered rehmannia is difficult to cultivate and easily rots during storage, so usually only the species with crimson flowers is planted. Rehmannia exists in three forms: dried rehmannia, fresh rehmannia, and prepared rehmannia.</p>
<p>Dried Rehmannia: Collected in winter, dried under the sun. Surface grayish-white or grayish-brown, longitudinally and transversely wrinkled, with warty protuberances, irregularly curved, approximately one centimeter thick. Cross-section smooth, dark purple, texture soft. The drug is odorless, has a sweet taste, slightly bitter.</p>
<p>Examining the cross-section under a microscope reveals the integument, formed by several layers of integument cells, forming a covering tissue. The cells of the cortical parenchyma often contain yellow resinous material. Stone cells are extremely rare. Vascular bundles arranged in a single row, rarely in two rows, accompanied by false vascular bundles, arranged radially.</p>
<p>Fresh Rehmannia: Collected and stored in shady sandy soil. The surface is yellowish-red, and the larger, moister pieces are of better quality.</p>
<p>Prepared Rehmannia: Fresh rehmannia that has been steamed and dried. The blacker the surface, the better the quality.</p>
<p>(Constituents) Roots contain mannitol and sugars.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old accounts: Rehmannia is a blood-tonifying and strengthening drug, especially valued for treating consumptive weakness. It also has a hemostatic effect, treating hemoptysis, epistaxis, hematemesis, uterine bleeding, etc. Daily dose is 5-10 cm, in decoction. The juice of fresh rehmannia can be applied to wounds.</p>
<p>"Cools the blood, generates blood, tonifies kidney yin, removes dryness of the skin, eliminates various damp-heat conditions."</p>
<p>Prescription Example: Tang-kuei and Six-Yellow Decoction, for general weakness, especially for consumptive patients with night sweats.</p>
<p>Tang-kuei (Angelica sinensis) · Astragalus, 4.0 each; Yellow Leaves (Rehmannia glutinosae folium) · Scutellaria (Scutellaria baicalensis) · Coptis (Coptis chinensis) · Fresh Rehmannia · Prepared Rehmannia, 3.0 each.</p>
<p>Prepare as a decoction (200), administer in three divided doses per day.</p>

<p>Chapter VII: Treatment of Dental Diseases</p>
<p>(Question 175) How is chronic infectious periodontitis treated?</p>
<p>Answer: This is chronic alveolar abscess, which can be divided into those with and without fistulas. First, the pulp chamber should be opened, the apical foramen enlarged, and pus drained with a probe. Cotton soaked in disinfectant is sealed into the root canal, and the dressing is changed daily until the pus is completely drained and there is no odor. Then, the root canal is filled. If the abscess has formed a fistula, the medicine solution can be injected from the pulp chamber, flowing out from the fistula to wash away the pus and dirt. A corrosive agent can be used to eliminate the fistula. In addition, there is a surgical treatment method, in which the alveolar bone is broken open, the tip of the root is cut off, and the abscess is scraped away to seek a radical cure.</p>
<p>(Question 176) Can the affected tooth be retained when suffering from acute or chronic alveolar abscess?</p>
<p>Answer: The various treatments mentioned above are very complicated and the results are difficult to stabilize. Often, prolonged treatment is still futile. This is because the pus-causing bacteria are deeply hidden in the affected area at the end of the root, making it difficult to completely eradicate. Therefore, if the treatment is ineffective, or the tooth is defective and useless, or if there are complications, the affected tooth should be extracted. Forcing its retention will only increase suffering. However, unless there are special circumstances, it is not advisable to extract the tooth while the acute symptoms have not subsided.</p>
<p>Section IV: On the Treatment of Alveolar Pyorrhea</p>
<p>(Question 177) How is early-stage alveolar pyorrhea treated?</p>
<p>Answer: Use special instruments to scrape away the calculus, then apply a suitable astringent to the gums several times, and frequently rinse with mouthwash.</p>
<p>(Question 178) How is alveolar pyorrhea with pus pockets treated?</p>
<p>Answer: First, thoroughly wash and scrape clean all the calculus and pus in the pus pockets, and apply an astringent. For stubborn cases, a corrosive agent must be used to destroy the affected area. If drug treatment is ineffective, surgery can be used to remove the pus pockets. If all methods are ineffective, the affected tooth must be extracted to prevent it from infecting adjacent teeth. In addition to local application of drugs, there are also oral medications and injections, which can sometimes have remarkable effects.</p>
<p>(Question 179) How are teeth that have already become loose treated?</p>
<p>Answer: Appliances can be used to secure and stabilize the teeth. After the disease subsides, or it may be possible to restore the original stability.</p>
<p>(Question 180) How is alveolar pyorrhea caused by systemic conditions treated?</p>
<p>Answer: First, treat the underlying cause, such as diabetes and venereal disease. As for the surgery and medications required for local treatment, they are the same as described above. However, these conditions should be treated by both dentists and general practitioners, which will be more effective.</p>
<p>(Question 181) Why should patients with general alveolar pyorrhea patiently cooperate with the dentist?</p>
<p>Answer: Because this condition requires long-term treatment, if the patient cannot cooperate closely with the doctor and follow his guidance, even if there is an excellent treatment method, a permanent effect cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>(Question 182) What hygiene measures should patients pay attention to themselves?</p>
<p>Answer: Avoid constipation, drink more water, and eat more fruits, vegetables, and brown rice to increase gastrointestinal activity. Do not swallow any pus in the mouth. Rinse your mouth immediately after eating. Get plenty of sunlight and fresh air. Avoid excessive indulgence and overwork, but appropriate exercise is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Section V: On the Treatment of Toothache</p>
<p>(Question 183) How do we feel toothache?</p>
<p>Answer: Because there is a problem with the teeth or other parts. The trigeminal nerve, which is distributed in the teeth, is stimulated, so it feels pain. Therefore, toothache cannot be considered an independent disease; it is just a warning indicating the existence of disease, so that we can quickly go to the doctor.</p>

<h3 id="e249">How to Suppress Smuggling <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zibin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal All Circles Anti-Smuggling Association was established recently. Regarding their position and work, it is clearly stated in the declaration: "...Hoping to assist the government from the perspective of automatic public participation, reporting smuggled goods, sanctioning traitors, to maintain the nation's economic lifeline, hoping that compatriots across the country will rise up together to eliminate smuggling...".</p>
<p>The prohibition of smuggled goods, apart from traitors, is fervently advocated by compatriots across the country. However, how should it be prohibited? Although the Anti-Smuggling Association has proposed two principles: "Report smuggled goods, sanction traitors," and has also appointed several people to draft an organizational outline and work outline, we cannot help but doubt whether such vague regulations and generalized methods can be effective in practice!</p>
<p>Because, the enemy's conspiracies are progressing day by day. They have torn off their hypocritical masks and use force to protect smuggling. It is precisely because of this that we feel that the old methods are no longer sufficient to deal with the current environment. Moreover, how can we talk about conscience to traitors who only care about profit, and how can the people thoroughly recognize smuggled goods besides贪便宜 (greed for cheapness)?</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that the so-called "reporting smuggled goods, sanctioning traitors" is perhaps too simplistic a view of the matter.</p>
<p>However, should we retreat in the face of difficulty? Of course not! I agree with the proposition of "reporting smuggled goods, sanctioning traitors," and I dare to believe that every Chinese citizen also agrees with this proposition. Precisely because we agree with this proposition, we must make our proposition a reality, we must use force to stop smuggling!</p>
<p>At present, only the use of force can stop smuggling!</p>
<p>While discussing how to suppress smuggling, I also thought about the forced ban of the plays "Smuggling" by the Experimental Little Theater and the Ant Troupe. In the territory of China, dramas depicting the reality of the Japanese "smuggling" within China are unable to be staged. Then, I do not know if the existence of China is still recognized in other countries of the world? Now, although some people have requested the Taxpaying Chinese Association to make a serious protest to the Municipal Council, for the sake of support, the Anti-Smuggling Association should take the lead and strive for it. Otherwise, if dramas depicting the reality of "smuggling" cannot be staged, how much less so will it be to "report smuggled goods, sanction traitors"!</p>
<h3 id="e250">Reading "Ten Records of a Southern Journey" (Part 2) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Taisheng</p>
<p>Now let's excerpt a few paragraphs to take a look:</p>
<p>In the seventh record, "Mountain, Water, Bridge and Tunnel," the author writes about the railway project along the Hunan-Guangdong Highway. Here is a passage with beautiful writing:</p>
<p>"The hand-cranked vehicle was placed on the rails, and Engineer Zhang and us, proceeded in the mountains that were artificially cut open. The mountains are ochre red, the stones are of all sizes and shapes, like snails, like millstones, like lions and dogs... As for what we saw on both sides, above were layers upon layers of continuous mountain peaks, and below was winding, long-flowing turquoise water, the mountains turned with the water, the water flowed around the mountains, the scenery was beautiful, as if in a painting..."</p>
<p>In the eighth record, "Guangzhou's Famous Sites," Guangzhou is described very clearly. The author went to Yuexiu Mountain to visit the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, then went to Huanghuagang to commemorate the "Seventy-Two Martyrs Tomb," and lingered for a long time at the Memorial Monument to the Soldiers of the 19th Route Army. The author also mentions the British and French concessions in Shamian, Guangzhou. The author says:</p>
<p>"...It is said that this Shamian concession has no lease term and no lease treaty. The Westerners still pay a few hundred dollars in rent every year. From this point, we cannot help but deeply lament the diplomacy handled by the previous government. Remembering the Shaji Massacre of that year, passing through the current June 23rd Road, the pain in my heart goes without saying." These words are said with great sorrow.</p>
<p>The ninth record is "Macau Zhongshan." On the afternoon of March 12, the author took a Hong Kong-Guangdong-Macau steamer from Hong Kong to Macau.</p>
<p>Macau, under the Portuguese policy of opium, gambling, and drugs, has caused the Chinese people of Macau to be forever mired in this bottomless pit. Therefore, when the author walked into a Macau hotel, he wrote:</p>
<p>"...When the elevator stopped and I stepped onto the second floor, a smell of opium smoke rushed straight into my nostrils. Under the short doors of each room, one could glimpse the four legs of a man and a woman, placed horizontally on two square stools. Undoubtedly, they were lying on the bed heavily smoking their opium. In addition, the sound of playing cards, clattering, the sound of talking, giggling, dozens of rooms, not one was empty."</p>
<p>In fact, we know that hotels in the Shanghai concessions are no different.</p>
<p>In addition, Macau has large-scale casinos, I do not know how many. These are all the most ruthless policies of the Portuguese to deal with the Chinese. Therefore, the author finally wrote!</p>
<p>"Although the Portuguese use opium and gambling policies to extract money from the Chinese, in recent years, the whole world has suffered from the invasion of depression, how can Macau not be affected? The income from opium and gambling is now decreasing year by year. The Portuguese have no other choice but to cleverly establish new items to levy taxes. For example, electricity must also be taxed, everything must be taxed, but the result is still insufficient. The future of Macau, under such circumstances, is always uneasy for the Portuguese." This passage is a true and accurate exposure of the Portuguese in Macau.</p>
<p>Outside of Macau, the author also went to Zhongshan to visit Sun Yat-sen's former residence.</p>
<p>The last chapter is the tenth record, "Hong Kong Tourism." Here, the author narrates the simple history of Hong Kong and Kowloon being leased to the British. In addition to visiting Hong Kong, Kowloon, Repulse Bay, and the aerial tram, the author further points out the recession in the Hong Kong market and the market being filled with Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is beautiful, especially the area around Repulse Bay beach. The author almost used the tone of poetry to eulogize Repulse Bay: Let's see:</p>
<p>"I love Repulse Bay the most! On the veranda of the Repulse Bay Hotel, looking at the clear, mirror-like seawater and the azure sky, all around is quiet, without a sound, the whole soul is in the embrace of the blue sea and the green sky. Especially the vast lawn in front of the hotel, so green that it is enchanting; in the northeast corner there is a flower shed, covered with bunches of yellow flowers, everywhere showing a strong spring light..."</p>
<p>Regarding the "Hanyu Records of Travel" appended at the end, due to the limited space, it is omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Flower Drum Opera (Continued) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow Dull</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, performing a day of flower drum opera, including food and lodging, only costs about ten dollars, so it's easily affordable. When performing flower drum opera, they would use straw mats and wooden boards in the village square to build a stage. They would perform two shows daily, one during the day and one at night. For the night show, they would hang two bamboo baskets upside down on the stage, line them with mud, and place two large kerosene lamps inside, one on the left and one on the right. Because the wicks were thick, even strong winds wouldn't extinguish them.</p>
<p>When a certain village was performing flower drum opera, people from far and near would rush to see it upon hearing the news, even those from more than ten miles away. Moreover, because people had less to do at night and were relatively free, the audience was quite lively. On a moonlit night...</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>...in a village draped in a layer of black, a stage corner was brightly lit with lamps and candles, and a flower drum opera was being performed. The audience stood quietly listening, which was, of course, absolutely different from the atmosphere inside a Shanghai theater, and possessed a different, more common touch.</p>
<p>When a flower drum opera was performed, a "Yang Tune Performance" was usually performed before the main play. The so-called "Yang Tune Performance" was like ballad singers singing a "double opening" before the main story. Although some plays in the flower drum opera repertoire had four or five, or even seven or eight characters on stage, most of them were duets between male and female roles. The male role was even called "Westerner" by the villagers. We don't know the meaning of this term.</p>
<p>Most of the people who sang flower drum opera were self-taught. The interludes played on the huqin (Chinese violin) formed their own unique melody. Originally, there was no formal musical score, and most flower drum opera plays were passed down orally, without scripts. The actors could make slight changes according to their own improvisation without being restricted. However, the lyrics were rhymed, and they paid close attention to the rhymes.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, all the female roles were played by men in disguise. It wasn't until later that women learned to sing flower drum opera, and from then on, all female roles in flower drum opera could be played by women. However, in incomplete troupes, the female roles were still played by men. After the rise of amusement parks in Shanghai, flower drum opera troupes were recruited and given the euphemistic name "Shen Opera." It is said that the place of origin of flower drum opera was indeed near Shanghai, such as the areas of Pudong and Qibao, so calling it "Shen Opera" can be said to be appropriate. Some people in our villages call flower drum opera "Eastern Township Tune" for this reason. Even people from the Western Township who sing flower drum opera have to learn the Eastern Township accent.</p>
<p>Many of the plays in the flower drum opera repertoire are quite obscene, but there are also some better ones. It's just because the people in the countryside, like the people of Shanghai who like to watch Bai Yushuang's "Widow Ma's Shop," always welcome low-brow scripts, so they mostly want to sing obscene lyrics and vulgar tunes. As a result, the authorities considered flower drum opera to be detrimental to public morals and banned it. In fact, if flower drum opera could be improved, removing obscene plays and specializing in plays that arouse the rural masses, I think it would be the most genuine and great driving force of popular drama in the vicinity of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Sea Burial Song <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>The sea howls.</p>
<p>In the sea breeze, a woman paced back and forth with faltering steps. The sea breeze scattered her long hair and made her clothes rustle. The woman's face was strangely pale, and her bare feet stepped over the piled-up broken shells.</p>
<p>The seawater surges.</p>
<p>Her footsteps fell on the sand, step by step, leaving sunken footprints on the sand. She welcomed the gale, walking on the beach.</p>
<p>She walked madly, letting the seawater rush over and hit her toes. Her eyes stared blankly at the sea, filled with anger and resentment.</p>
<p>The tide is rising.</p>
<p>Her face twitched, her mouth opened wide, letting the sea breeze pour into her throat, causing her to hiccup violently. Her hair was disheveled like a wild ghost, her hands clenched convulsively, and her head rushed into the wind.</p>
<p>She screamed madly on the ground, her voice so miserable.</p>
<p>Her feet danced on the beach, and the seawater splashed up.</p>
<p>Her eyes stared blankly at the rolling sea, as if through the sea, shooting into the dark place. The sea in front of her seemed to fade away, showing swollen corpses one by one.</p>
<p>Past memories emerged one after another.</p>
<p>She thought sadly and angrily that the sea had buried three generations of her family.</p>
<p>When she was still a child, the sea took away her father. When she grew up, the sea took away her husband. Ten years passed, and yesterday the sea buried her only child.</p>
<p>The sea took away her happiness, the sea snatched away her beloved ones one by one from her arms, the sea submerged all her hopes. She thought crazily on the ground, her eyes overflowing with hot tears.</p>
<p>She had hated the sea since she was a child.</p>
<p>She remembered that when she was young, she was picking up seashells. The blow of her father being buried at sea ended her quiet childhood. She was sent to another fisherman. When she grew up and got married and was about to regain happiness, the sea took away her husband and her fishing boat. She lived a hard life until ten years later, when she placed her last hope of happiness on her handsome child. On a stormy day, the sea swallowed her son again – the sea buried three generations of her family.</p>
<p>The heavy taxes and the piling debts made her dear ones leave her embrace and throw themselves into the sea, to be buried at sea. They were all young and had excellent hopes. They grew from the earth, but one by one they were swallowed by the sea.</p>
<p>They all knew that the sea was dangerous. They were whipped by poverty in the sea to find a way to live, and one by one became prisoners of the sea.</p>
<p>She remembered yesterday, when her child sailed out on the sailboat, she still saw his face full of youthful radiance and his strong body. She secretly prayed for him, "May he return safely!"</p>
<p>Attacked by a big storm, her child would not return. The sea cruelly robbed her of everything.</p>
<p>She had given her beloved ones to the sea, but the sea brought and gave her – some broken planks, clothes, and scattered things that floated from the sea.</p>
<p>She was angry, her eyes hostile to the seawater.</p>
<p>The sea roared, the seawater soaked her knees, the rolling water rose, and the waves surged.</p>
<p>She angrily stretched out her fists and threw herself into the sea. She was rushing wildly in the tide.</p>
<p>Her feet sank in, she struggled, sinking deeper, her body shaking, and a wave of tide shook her.</p>
<p>She roared desperately, the roar was so tragic and sharp, containing generations of anger and a lifetime of resentment.</p>
<p>The seawater submerged her chest...</p>
<p>The tide surged like boiling.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Tiger Plague <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fu</p>
<p>Rural Life Accelerates – One of the Greens</p>
<p>It is said that this year is the "Year of the Tiger Plague."</p>
<p>Tiger Plague is a new academic name, commonly known as cholera, and called "plague" by the common people. They also say that it is a disaster caused by the wrath of the Plague God, so in the villages and towns of North China, you can often see temples to the Plague God.</p>
<p>Because the general farmers know that the plague is caused by the wrath of the Plague God, naturally those who get the plague should burn incense and paper, build altars and set up rituals, hoping that the Plague God will show great compassion and be able to calm his anger and turn misfortune into good fortune, and have to submit to the Plague God.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China, when the plague was advancing towards Jinan along the Jiaoji Railway, I was a primary school teacher in a small county in Jiaodong, forty or fifty miles away from the Jiaoji Railway, in a small town more than ten miles away from the county seat. The people in the whole town were worried about the arrival of the Plague God, and every household burned incense and paper. The fragrance and ashes of paper filled the sky above the whole town.</p>
<p>The training director of the primary school was an extremely anti-superstitious person. Every time he taught a class, he always took some time to discuss the issue of the plague. He also specially organized a propaganda team to break superstition, divided into groups and set off to explain the prevention and treatment of the plague to the farmers in the whole town. The most effective method was naturally vaccination, but at that time there was no such facility in the town. In order to prevent the occurrence of the plague, although there was a lack of equipment on the active side, on the passive side, the township office immediately stopped the business of meat merchants and prohibited eating raw cooked vegetables and raw water. That was the late summer when watermelons were out of season.</p>
<p>The Plague God did not reduce his murderous aura because of burning incense and paper. More than two-thirds of the villages in the whole county had already fallen into his clutches! The first person in this small town was a young strong man who died suddenly in the field while working! That night, everyone in the town knew the shocking news. The smoke of incense, the ashes of paper, and the sound of firecrackers added to the atmosphere. The whole town was unusually lively that night.</p>
<p>In the primary school, because it was just the beginning of the semester, most of the students from other villages could not come because of the plague, so there were very few people. Only half of them were students from this town. When a primary school student came crying to ask for leave, another student also came crying to ask for leave. One reported that his mother had died! One reported that his father had died! The next morning, the primary school student who asked for leave also died! The plague killed people in twenty-odd hours if slow, and quickly if it was fatal where the person died after falling to the ground with their legs twitching out. Moreover, the person was unconscious when they got sick, and it was very difficult to take medicine. The most convenient way was still acupuncture. The only old scholar and traditional Chinese medicine doctor in this small town could only prescribe decoctions, but did not know acupuncture. Therefore, those who got sick and sought medical treatment had to go to other villages. A family who got the plague sent someone to another village to invite an acupuncture doctor. It happened that the doctor was treating a family who got the plague. Not only did he not cure the patient's disease, he fell under the bed and died! The person who invited the doctor not only did not bring the doctor back, but died in the doctor's home. The person who carried the coffin of the sick person in the morning was carried by others himself at night. The whole town echoed with tragic cries, and the streets were filled with children running around in mourning clothes. Every day, when dusk was dim, the sound of firecrackers was mixed with the mournful and prolonged tune of "calling the soul." The weather was as sultry as a whole piece, and in the firelight of burning the clothes of the dead, the hot wind of summer steamed up with a fishy smell.</p>
<p>In the northern rural custom of funerals, there is a program of "breaking tiles," which is to break new tiles in front of the coffin during the funeral. Because the school was repairing the classroom, people with tears in their eyes were constantly coming in and out to borrow tiles every afternoon. The school's tiles were constantly being borrowed every day, and people's lives were constantly being destroyed by the Plague God! When the sound of crying came from the school's northern neighbor, we were so frightened that we moved to the front yard. The front neighbor sent the sound of crying again; everyone moved to the middle again, and when the sound of crying came from all the neighbors, the school had to be forced to close! Of course, because the teachers could not settle down to teach, and the students were also slowly decreasing.</p>
<p>According to the village elders, "The Plague God is particular about the year, and it will be better when the year turns over." The whole town then decided on the day of "New Year" on the desperate road where there was no way to think. Whether rich or poor, they were all waving the sweat of summer to prepare for "New Year." On the morning of that day, which was full of "New Year" scenes, the training director who opposed superstition and the Plague God and I were frightened and left that small town.</p>
<p>On the road from the town to the county seat, in every village, on the streets, children running around in mourning clothes, everyone was pulling a sad face, and everywhere we heard cries, the sound of firecrackers, and the mournful and prolonged sound of "calling the soul." A gust of hot wind blew the smell of incense and the smell of burning paper. Several villages had run clean, quietly leaving behind a pile of broken houses that could not be taken away.</p>
<p>When I saw the news of "Year of the Tiger Plague" in the newspaper, a tragic picture of the plague wreaking havoc, the sincere faces of a group of farmers who had to believe in the Plague God, and a pair of pitiful eyes clearly appeared before my eyes again.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Gold and Beauty"</p>
<p>What in the world is easy to move people's hearts? Only gold and beauty. Gold can take away the ambition of the common man. A word from a beauty is like an imperial edict. Look at how many young people have suffered setbacks. It is also for gold and beauty. I remember that King Xiang of Chu, a hero, committed suicide at Wujiang. He was reluctant to leave Beauty Yu. Look at how corrupt officials fight for power. They are always thinking about gold. Some are for gold, brothers fighting with each other. Some are for gold, plotting money and harming lives. Some are for gold, loved ones become enemies. Some are for gold, husband and wife separated in two places. Some are for gold, conscience changes in an instant. Some are for gold, losing virtue and losing themselves. Gold, I think you are, an evil doing supreme power. I don't know how many people you have harmed. I see you. You have great power to reverse right and wrong. So, gold can buy the heart of a beauty. Let's see, since ancient times, beauties have had great magic power. Not only can they topple kingdoms and cities. I remember that Tang Jieyuan in Xiao Yuan. He was full of affection for the beauty. Wen Bizheng in Double Pearl Phoenix. He sold himself to the Heavenly Official's door. Like a scholar, he doesn't want to do it.</p>
