<p>農本局組織規稈已於日前在行政院會議通過依各方盼望之殷則該局成立期當不遠事先實業部與銀行界旣有充分之接洽硏究則調達資金似亦不致有何困難記者對於該局之創立認為事屬急要惟就組織規程一為研究則頗覺此一機關旣負救濟農村之偌大責任非更有精密之規劃不可</p>
<p>救濟農村本為複雜困難之事其重要之點曰經濟之扶助曰產銷之調劑曰生產技術之改良今農本局之任務依規稈為「調整農業產品流通農業資金」是於上舉三端除技術方面外均在其工作範圍以內規程第五條以農產部辦理調整農產以農貸部辦理救濟農村金融自表面言之固規劃井然矣雖然調　產銷關係方面甚多其不易收效已早有言之者救濟農村金融數年來上海銀行界及各省農民銀行亦多有所努力而在本年中國銀行報告中評為「只盡其滄海一粟之力」事非容易於此可見農本局縱為統一機關但于上述兩端期獲美滿成績實應先定工作進行之步驟</p>
<p>所謂工作進行之步驟指業務上應辦各事之先後緩念而言農本局農產農貸兩　應辦之事有九均係看似容易實多困難者齊頭並進斷不可能欲求成效須視河者為最要何者為次要河者巳有他機關着手辦理不須特加注意何者係屬急要必應努力從事例如產品運銷關係方面最多非借政治力量不能進行無礙宜由農本局以全力主持若貸欵及產品抵押等前各銀</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之二十八）</p>
<p>上海腸業之現狀　上海腸莱分爲三類：（一）鮮腸號，範圍狄小，營業尙稱穩定：　腸廠，異動頗多，現在者都受洋商扶掖；　出口行，洋商占絕對優勢。茲分述其現狀如下：</p>
<p>鮮腸　：滬市鮮腸號有同業公會之組織，會址在閘北南林里林弄，入會會員有二十叫家，資本一二千元不　，最高亦不過九千元。每晨收貨多者百餘副，少僅三四十副。全滬每日宰猪有限，故鮮腸號之營弟，實屬微細。茲將鮮腸號名單列下：</p>
<p>腸廠：滬市腸廠共有十餘家，內分華商及洋商，惟華商經營之腸廠，皆與洋商有關，近聞全體腸廠，由德商直　問接經營者占百分之四十五。腸廠營業以拋　爲主，所負風險較大，先後虧累　閉者有馬良記·兪松記·永利·順豐·餘興·致源·潘德福·豐茂·源源郭順記。新大等廠，現存各廠，之名單列下：</p>
<p>（註）該廠不久將遷往閘北</p>
<p>出口行：本市腸衣出口行，均屬外商經營，德，法，英，美均有之。營業額最多達四十萬元。華商經營之出口行，有漢利，盈豐兩家，內容殷實，信用孚著，國外商行樂予交易。漢利行除在本市設廠外，定海亦有腸廠一所。各行因墊欵關係，資格運用頗繁，但現今都能獲利。茲將出口行名單列下：</p>

<p>— 槐青</p>
<p>楊秀　掀起了我國女子游泳界的熱浪、國人的愛戴擁護，理所當然、然而萬惡的社會，偏偏用畸形的姿態，以達其某種的目的、與隨其某種願望，這是豈是運動界之福。</p>
<p>今楊女士將代表中國出席世運會、她在國內的成績，在這沒落的時代裏，因應該認為相當的滿意了、但以楊女士的成績去參加世運會究有若何的希望呢，我們且把她的成績，和歷次世運會的女子游泳成績、對照比較一下，我們就可以知道楊女士的希望，和其他各項選手是一般的毫無希望、而且是最最沒有希望的。</p>
<p>社會愛戴楊女士的熱度，可說到了沸點以上，年青的楊女士將用怎樣的眼光，去鑒別展開在她目前的人　用怎樣的理智去應付惡的畸形的社會，何況是一位學齡時代的少女，前途有希望的一位女運動家，要不誤人岐途，而她的運動技術，也恐怕只此而止了。</p>
<p>南京上海兩次全國運動會、和在菲律賓舉行的　東運動，楊女士的勝利，固然都值得社會人士熱列的推崇。然而日本女子沒有參加第十已由遠運，也是促成楊女士享受非常榮譽的一大原因，我們雖不十分明了日本女子游泳水准是怎樣，但統括說一句，楊女士的成績，和她們還差得很遠，距離世界游泳水準，差得更遠了，我們應該積極的鼓勵楊女士，善意的督促楊女士、以達到真真光明的境地，為中國女子體育界放一線曙光。</p>

<p>— 姚幕</p>
<p>沒有回到生長所在的×城去，快又十年了：兒時所依戀的慈祥的老親戚，曾經一住許多年的舊家廢園，元宵　着的社燈，撼動全城—特別是幼稚的心靈—的迎神賽會，縱然有峙也帶着一點惆悵的滋味，偶然在我的記憶裏，夢長閃現着，然也只是閃現而已，永遠在風塵中流逐的人，懷鄉夢不輕易染得吧。</p>
<p>離淸明還有好幾大，爲我新添了白髪的老父特地叫我到他的面前鄭重地說道：</p>
<p>「祖墳沒有回去祭掃好幾年了，做你們的祖先眞是灰心，連冷猶肉也沒一口吃」</p>
<p>「唔」—他見我沒有怎樣答應他，憤憤地繼績說道：「將來我死絕不用你們費心，水葬倒落得干凈！養了四個兒子………」他接着照例嘮嶗叨叨的把他平日對於兒子們的一腔牢騷向着我發洩下去</p>
<p>我也照例從頭聽到尾，一聲不變，等到他把小型牙牌從盒子倒出來，開始玩他的牙牌神敗時，才淡淡的答道：</p>
<p>「就是這個禮拜六去吧，省得等到淸明人擠」，在家困了半年的我實在膩了，只想換換地方，回鄉自然是不加反對的事。</p>
<p>這幾年的光景，連鄉渡也改變得刺眼了，縱然船身還是中古意味的油着紅綠花紋的平底樓船，幽晤的矮矮的統艙裏永遠是七橫八豎地擠，薰蒸着一股特有的腥　的船味，但是，至少「餐樓」巳不倫不類地挿入一些現代的裝置　：在奉着海神的花龕前列着的不是一排一排的帆布馬极，而是兩排的「烤猪盤」式的分上下層墊有軟褥的「碌架床；煤油燈換上了明亮的電燈，閒情逸致的茶盅換上了實用主義的暖水壺連自然的水厠也給抽水馬桶—近代文明的主要象徵—替代了。</p>
<p>可是船前的離亂嘈鬧，依舊支配着：碼頭前渡夫在提着幌幌的燈籠高聲喊着，兜攬人客，脚夫在　接着行李，在兩岸的霓紅燈烘染成的火災似的天空的籠罩之下這一角隅的人間構成一幅極熱鬧的油畫，在渡船裏，小販們在喊着穿挿着，客人們在爭占着床位，一片平崛重濁像吵嘴似的鄉音聽來倒覺有點不慣了。聲已敲過，船快就開了，紛亂的熱浪　沉下了一點·餐房前的籐椅上，幾個餐房客悠開地在搭訕着：</p>
<p>「鶴翁，發福得很呵，怪不得何老錦說你您今年屯榖縣了有一方多呢」，一個掛着證章的中年男子帶笑道。</p>
<p>「聽他瞎吹」！答話的是個上了年紀的鄉紳模樣的人，「他自已發了財才眞」。</p>
<p>一這兩個月內穀價不是由三塊多錢長到六塊多嗎」？另一個人在挿問。</p>
<p>「但是，我是五塊錢的時候買了三千包，用法幣誰敢多做生意，賺的也有限，誰像何老錦自己棧房排得實實的還存墔棧」！鶴翁門牙面上露出懊的　色</p>
<p>「在這個不景氣的年頭，您老也好心足了，聽說今年　　扇　雜貨行都呌苦連天呢！」</p>
<p>老頭子沒有答話，起身走出外頭去，扁着的嘴角掛着得意的微笑，襄着疎疎幾根頭髮的光頭浮出光彩。</p>
<p>護船的勇馬馬虎虎檢査過行李後，船眞個開行了，熾紅的光氣，嘈雜的人聲漸漸的遠了遠了，只餘潺潺的水響和時時一鳴的汽笛聲把疲倦的搭客先後送到睡鄉去。</p>
<p>改乘長途汽車到了×城，正是早市的時候，浩大蒼蠅之羣包在開始經營他們一天的生活了。在路上，在行人的背上，在小孩子臉上，都　集着這黑色的小動物；路帝的魚攤，人家簷前掛着鹹雨，米舖子米籮都密佈着黑點黏像黑芝蔴似的·每走一步，面前擺着的蒼蠅陣便嗡的一聲散開，飛起，撲向臉上來，向耳朶鼻孔裏鑽。置身在這蒼蠅的王國，我認識這是千眞萬確的故鄉了。</p>
<p>新築的幾條馬路閒閒地臥着，只有幾輛人力車裝飾品般七八糟的舊　攤和食品攤是馬路的實際使用者。砌着石板的街巷依然是給蔗渣，狗糞，人糞，污水占據着。舊房子翻造的洋樓確有不少了，但是像「矮脚門」那一類的，全是像「矮脚門」那一類的老式東西保留着，有些屋襄還擺着視母們坐的長背的矮竹椅。街頭巷尾的堆著石頭的社壇仍舊滿貼着寄男寄女的名兒條，不過，祠堂却比前更荒凉：話茬桿倒折了，旗桿石崩坍了，大門前兩旁　我們在故鄉沒有祠堂，沒有祖屋，連至親的親戚也七零八落了，只好在一個繼舅母家裏安頓下。一些疏遠的表新早已在那兒候着我們了。</p>
<p>「姑丈納福啊，表哥們眞本事……」，</p>
<p>「姑奶奶如果在世，那就不知怎樣歡喜呢！」</p>
<p>「沒有甚麼，外頭好看吧！」老父冷冷的答道，也不知是有點驕傲，還是觸着癢處。我暗說聲「慚愧」。</p>
<p>老女人們麽挲着我的大孩子問長問短，笑對我道，「你外公做壽的時候你也是一般的大呢！」</p>
<p>是的也是像這孩　樣的年紀，我常跟着母親到這兒來，那時外公，舅父，表姊們還在生，正是舅家全盛的時候，三進的房子才新蓋起，在響館面前滿栽着萬花的院子中間有一個安着假山大金魚缸，是對於我最有吸力的東西·接連着娶表嫂，嫁表姊，來往親戚眞是流水似的，熱鬧得很·可是自從外公死後，舅家便襄敗起來！幾年間丁口死了大半，房子在白天鬧着鬼，後來便把三分二賣掉，連五十多歲的大表哥也要作最後的掙扎，重回到南美洲去·現在繼舅母住的只是書館那一邊，金魚缸早已不知那兒去了，連舅父心愛的蘭花也死個乾凈。</p>
<p>「何家大塘的老何怎樣俗？父親正同一個從的跟過他　事的堂大舅感慨似的談着×城的舊家情况。</p>
<p>「不消提起他們了，太保府，東園莊，都敗得七零八落了，何家大塘，咳，人家稱做小澳門·子弟們不是吹就是賭，據說槍就有八九十桿！」</p>
<p>「烟槍吧？」　「可不楚，不敗才怪呢！」　「老躱在鄉下吃蒸嘗，吃家當，那裏會長久！」父親又發揮他的好漢要在外頭創業那種老主張。</p>
<p>在祭品備好以前，我偷空去看從小伺候我的李媽一趟。螺螄壳砌成的矮牆已有點歪了，一進了門樓就看見天井裏那棵松樹還是從前那樣的蒼翠盤鬱，但是，不見幾年李媽已有點老態了。依舊用玉髻押結成的髻雜有不少白髮，沒了門牙的嘴更歪了一點。</p>
<p>「阿明」她張開嘴笑呼着我的小名，「甚麼時候回來的啊？一一眼見我旁的孩子一把他拉到身邊，問道：「這是你的老大人吧，還有幾個弟妹？唉，多趣乖！簡直像你小的時候一樣·老四，料不到李媽還有命看見你的孩子。」</p>
<p>「呌聲婆吧」我給孩子說·　「我的寳寳」，她一邊說一邊老往身上掏，許久才掏出兩個銅子來，强塞在孩子的手裏，「小意思，給你買吃的」。</p>
<p>「日子過得還好？還縫着葵扇吧？」我看見她的屋子裏還堆着好些散着。的葵扇和泡着籐綫的水埕。</p>
<p>「還不是那個樣子！」他微嘆了一聲，「葵扇活也不是常有的，我的眼睛近夾不行了，一天只縫得十柄，　他二分多錢。」</p>
<p>我仔細端詳她，果然眼睛也有點暗淡了。兒時她和我的祖母在黃昏裹神前的琉璃燈下如飛的縫着扇沙沙作聲的情狀突然浮現在目前。</p>
<p>他略略問問我家裏的情况後，我便向她吿辭了。</p>
<p>『連茶也沒一杯給你們喝呢，這屋子也太髒」她向我們客氣起來，「住在舅母那兒吧？我一會來看你們」。</p>
<p>「我們正要請你來帮忙分詐肉給親戚們呢！」</p>
<p>出了郊外，墳山已纍纍在望了。我跟着父兄們上墳已不知多少叵了，路總是認不得·從前沿途密密的堆着靑綠的葵地，有些已是荒廢了，有些却垂着萎黃的敗葉。但是山頭坑邊的杜鵑花永遠是血一樣的紅，山路是很平坦的，不過在乾熱像初夏似的太陽光中，走起來倒有點吃力。孩子們流簫滿頭的汗還是跳跳蹦蹦的走，父親閒適地邁着健步，跟堂大舅一路談談笑笑，有時還停脚指點那是誰家的墳山。</p>
<p>烤猪總算勉强備了一口，但還是因陃就簡：至少像「牛眠吉地」鶴立佳城」那樣的誇大的山墳對聯已沒有預備了。父親恭恭敬敬地拜過一處山墳，總要流連一下，刻板的風水論從自負懂得堪與的父親口中流瀉出來。</p>
<p>「這就是蟾蜍吐火了」，父親像背着他的得意的文章似的，口馴指畫，「你們看，後頭枕着五老芙暮峰，前頭正對着圭峯做案，案就是筆架的意思，在從前至少包發一個知縣呢！」</p>
<p>「前面那點水瀉一點，不聚財。」大舅也裝作內行批評道。</p>
<p>「但是，遠水好，就不妨，，」父親連忙辯道。「從前大伯父爲着爭這一穴山，就跟他的親家反了面，到現在還有人想僭進來呢。」</p>
<p>接着他們便談到附近一帶墳山的地理和×城的縉紳的家乘來。道穴山發了幾個舉人，那穴山發了幾萬的家產產，談得津津有味。</p>
<p>孩子們不是在墳邊採着野花，便是覷着壁上的甘蔗嚷着口渴。</p>
<p>記得我八九歲的時候，一聽見去掃墓，就高興跳起來，速舅家拜山時，我也常跟着去，爲的是要在山間採社鵑花，掘水橫枝，到北郊塲的岳飛廟前用甘蔗尾打秦檜夫婦的鐵像（重陽的風俗）。在墳前的一頓大嚼，更易惹起我的饞涎，當大人們在淺斟細酌的時候，我也啖甘蔗，咬猪骨了，允其是燒鵝肝的風味，至今還使人戀戀。十現在，開壊煙是頗例似的祭掃一下，這種歡悅只有在記憶中個略吧！</p>
<p>進城的時候，太陽邊散着飲露，我們的歸路恰經過我出世所在的橫冲，兒時的舊事又驀地裏湧上心頭來。月光下雪白的石板路和石橋，隔冲過新娘時的一片火光和水裏幢續的人影燈影，一切都似個有詩意。</p>
<p>「你的爸爸就是在這兒出世了，」父親指着司徒祠對他的孩兒笑說這。</p>
<p>「咦！這間破房子！」給這孩子一說，這裏的荒凉景象再不容我否認了。</p>
<p>狹小的司徒祠緊關着門，牆襲長着靑苔，面前的小冲已幹涸了，堆着垃圾，跨過冲的小石橋也殘破不完了，兩岸住着人家的祠堂都靜悄悄的，有點像兵燹過後的情景。在夢寐裏理想裏營繞着的美麗的圖畫興眼前的現實終是兩樣的啊！</p>

<p>秋空斷雲底，一匹瘦騎蹈着淸冷的殘照在古荒的原野踟躕。枯萎的叢莽，裹住荒墳無數；荒墳里，埋藏着千萬個永世不醒的夢。斜挿在一堆士邱旁的短椿上，尙留下一段糢糊的字：——上士張得强葬此。西風里荒烟漠漠，那里似效烟連天的記憶？夕陽也懂得人間事？默默里寫出了千古無限悲凄！騎馬人，在蒼茫的暮色里消逝了；螟濛的彼方，却送來一聲凄厲的馬嘶！</p>

<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>開走了十二　半的最後一幫列車，這個築在山野地的小火車站，復又入於寂靜之中了。天上，隱隱的現掛着一輪，滿月，照得這個寬廣的村野都白亮起來了，忽的看來，就像是一幅用水銀塗就的世界。</p>
<p>在這時，號旗手王大正從戈房里邊打着呵欠，邊跨開步望通到村上的那條用小蛋石砌就的小路走。他是一個年紀很靑，沉靜而且誠實的農民。兩年前在他底住在大城的姑丈榮仟白水站副站長後，他才被介紹到這蠻地來當號旗手的。那時他還是一個有孤獨癖的小夥子，對於自己底職務很感到滿足。吃飯，工作，睡覺……都按照着一個馴良人們底規律做去，日子過得完全像溪流一般的平靜。可是不久，他底平靜的溪流，開始有人丟下了一塊滾石，使它動漾而且不寗靜起來。那是當他認識了這村裏長一個姓馬的少婦以後。這少婦，是一個個子不大，年紀還只有二十五六，有一雙小星般眼睛和一副恬靜而且眞摯笑面的婦人。媳經常穿着的雖都是些經過縫補破爛的衣服，但是却很整潔。她底洪亮的聲音，她底誠摯的微笑，好底有禮貌的待人接物態度，往往都有很大誘惑一般年靑農民的麗力的，可是村里人却都有點怕她，不屑去理她。</p>
<p>當站長在他村裏新建築的公館，做三十五壽辰的時候，二王大才和這個嫵媚的少婦認識她底美麗，使他感到了驚駭。他是第一决覺得自己在女人面前顚倒了之後，每到十二點半最後的一幫列車開走後，他便常常跑到她底窗子外，來回巡走着，嘴裏輕輕的用吻哨唱着在　網情的山歌。她打開窗門，而且也用夢寐般的聲　回唱着，於是他便大着膽爬進窗去。這樣他們便戀愛起來了。</p>
<p>關於她，王大知道的很詳。她沒有家，也沒有任何田地，祇是一個死了丈夫的寡婦，一個死了女兒的母親，一個孤零零的被侮辱損害的村莊少婦。她有一個豪放不噩而近於瘋在的性格，這是一些　地裏失意少婦們常有的性格，喝酒而隨便地跟任，何自己所喜歡的農民胡混。有時她是在田野裏被灌醉着酒沿着田塍奔跑，嘴裏唱着淫猥的歌曲，而年靑的農民們則揮動着他們的柳木板在背後追趕，用粗大的喉嚨和着唱；有時她是被按倒在地底下扯光了衣服，披散着頭髮，由幾個彈三弦琴的逼着舞跳。她是被人家當作玩具而隨意娛樂，她是被悔辱與損害的；然而，她却因此而得到了她底工作和必須的食料。</p>
<p>王大恨她這種野蠻人不羈的生活方式；然而，他不能沒有她，他底生活楚寂寞的，枯竭的，他已深深地被她底美麗迷惑着了。「我一定要去規勸她，我耍這麽地向她說道：馬莎這種生活是回怕的，你有一個做上等女人的好性格，你必須要好好地做一個受人尊敬與歡迎的女人！……」想到這兒，他微笑了。他相信祇要有他這樣的一句話，那該會收到了怎樣的效果？然而，他馬上便給另一幅陰影所罩而冰冷了。他看見了她那醉後無恥的狂笑，他看見了她那淫猥的舞跳，他想起了她齷齪的嘴裏發出的那些歌詞，他想起了那三弦琴的嗚鳴聲和那彈琴人爲興奮所燃燒着的愚笨的面臉。他暴怒了。「這是多麽可怕，多麼可怕的生活啊！……」</p>
<p>這時，他已踏進了村子的第一個柵門，在遠遠，那住着站長和他底一家的洋房子，蠻地裏僅有的文明建築物，那闊大的玻璃窗上，還映射着一縷强烈的燈光。村子却已變的更加沉靜而荒凉了　他慢慢的走着，不自覺地在站長底洋房子門口站了一會，於是便轉過★個磨坊的屋角，望馬家寡婦的草房子過去。</p>
<p>房門給用一條麻繩子扣住了，這是當他打了好一會門還沒聽見裏面的回應時才發覺的。「這個潑貨又到什麼一地方去了？」他憤怒地對自己說着，便想掉轉頭回工房去。但是似乎有一件什麼東西在迷惑着他，使他感到不容和猶豫。「不！我不能够回去，無論怎樣，我一定要找到她。」他兀自喃着。突然，他側頭傾聽起來了，因爲他聽見了一陣笑聲，一陣大膽的，無恥的喧笑，從草原清茶着銀光的鄒邊襄漾過來</p>
<p>他感到自己是　怒的，然而却又有點兒憂傷，他是被嫉炻心所刺痛了。於是他便忽忙地邁開步向草原的那邊飛跑過去。</p>
<p>草原上，正有一羣人們底笑聲，吶喊在洋溢着。三弦琴伴着無恥的歌聲。他聽見了一尖的嗓子，那正是馬家寡婦的嗓子啊！也在那兒顫着，道使得他底胸膛爲憤怒所燃燒了。</p>
<p>他站立一會，想着藩便躱進一株柏柏樹下，倫眼向那草原上瞭望。他看見了在那赤裸的草原上，那白濛濛的日光下，正有兩顆活的小星在熌耀，這一定就是她，他相信着。他叉看見那兩顆小星突然奔跑起來了，後面跟雖着一個年靑的粗莽的陰影。他們沿着草原，沿着田塍，在奔走，奔走着……。終於小星失却了芒光，，蝕落在地，這就是說她底披散的頭髮或她底身七的任何一部份，被扭住而且按倒在地了。接着他便聽見了一陣尖啞的掙扎，嘶叫，帶着淫猥的吼駡，可是三弦琴的音響和無恥的歌聲，很快地便掩沒了他們底一切。王大顫慄了，他懊悔着目己不該到這兒來，他憎恨着這美麗的月夜，他憤怒着這羣無恥的暴徒：爲什麼人們要侮辱她呢？……</p>
<p>他憤怒地想着。</p>
<p>草原上，疲憊已在這些年靑男女中汎濫着了，他们与奮而且滿足地邊走邊唱的望村里跑回去。可是她，那姓馬的寡婦，却仍還在那兒，她也許正在渴望着某種東西，或許正在期待着什麽，可是誰也看不出，因爲她正在對着月亮沉思，草原是靜寞的，因了月光的吸舐，一，切都變得更加悽凉了。王大黨大家都跑的運了，便悄悄的從柏柏樹下爬出，望草原上用飛速的步伐踅將過去。</p>
<p>他奔跑着，奔跑着，不顧一切地奔跑着，終於在她底背後停止了。這兀突的出現，很使她感到忽促和驚駭，可是他却只冷笑着，無言地坐在她底旁邊。有一陣可怕的風暴，正在他度心中爭斗着而且很使他感到創痛。</p>
<p>忽然，在寂靜里他給一陣尖啞的笑聲所　悸了。抬起頭，正是那一對熌灼着芒光的小星，正是那一陣從腿齪的，無恥的嘴唇發出的淫笑。他想起了：那歌聲，那三弦琴的嗚嗚，那裸赤的舞跳，他暴怒了，兩手在發顫。有一種冲動，有一種無意識的興奮在慫恿，苦痛着他。於是，他便不自然地伸出了方手，從他底腰袋里抽出了那把爲防衛自已而携帶着的腰刀，憤恨的用力刺進她底背脊，鮮紅的血跡噴射着，像一注急泉似的，她只微弱的在笑了兩聲，便無力的癱倒在他底溫暖的懐中。</p>

<p>— 李三郞</p>
<p>辣痛的近視眼睛，在黑沉的夜里瞪着白白的原稿紙，挨着水門汀地面透出來使人痺痛的寒冷的氣息寫着稿子。妻子不時地抬起那有毛病的眼珠子，偷偸地望着他那動也不動的伏在檯上的背影，屏住了氣息地，只聽到筆尖在紙面行走着的索索地響個不停的聲音。檯面的時籟短針已經在十二點上面。她太息似地歎了一口氣的：</p>
<p>「偉！好睏覺吧，眼睛要緊呀！別變做瞎子呀！」</p>
<p>他軸過頭來望了一望她那蓬亂的頭髮和那黃瘦的臉孔，使他想到四五年新婚★的時候她那美麗的豐腴的臉孔，給魔鬼吸食得飢黃了。迷人的眼珠子換上了紅腄的圈子了。自己呢？還是戴着四年前的平光眼鏡，每個夜里還是繼績地挨着辣痛工作着。爲了家，爲了小孩子，爲了重曡的債目，爲了眼前的一家六口的食麪，四個月的房租，他不能不忘掉了自己好像被殘酷的鞭子打着樣痛苦，絞着苦汁的寫着那不値錢的稿子。</p>
<p>嘆了一口氣的，瞪了瞪的噠的噠地響着的時鐘，沉昏地在窗外刮着北風的悄靜的時候，投進了那溫暖的被窩里去了</p>
<p>早上，給嘩啦嘩啦地，吵鬧着和小孩子的哭聲擾醒了，他急忙地披着衣服跑出了亭子間的門檻，他正面地望見年老的母親那沒掉門牙的嘴巴在動着，深凹進去的小眼睛緊皺着，高高的顴骨尖突着，臉色更顯得黃異而可怕了，這樣子做兒子的他已經看慣了的，並不覺得怎麽可怕。她嚕囌地吵駡着，舞手踏脚的就好像在做戲似的，他禁不住的煩惱了起來，霎霎眼睛又望了一望下而的妻，消着淚的臉孔正呶着股委屆的氣的嘴巴，嬰孩在她的懷抱里哇哇地哭個不住的。</p>
<p>「什麽事情？天亮就嘩啦嘩啦地吵！」</p>
<p>「沒緣沒故的就駡我，還要打我。」妻的眼睛吊着一串一串的淚珠了，</p>
<p>「你們，年輕的，我跟你們做老娘姨呀！你們却沒有良心，我沒衣裳穿啦，你們有錢，不拿出一個鈿！」</p>
<p>「什麼事値得你這樣吵，你不做就讓她做，我早就呌你不要做，你自偏偏要這樣，整天整日的吵！」</p>
<p>妻在嗚咽地哭着，孩子在哇哇地哭着。</p>
<p>「孩子也給她摔倒了，狼心的！」</p>
<p>「我沒有想到你會有這樣的一天對待我，你們有錢也不給我做做人情，也不肯還債。」</p>
<p>「天曉得，我這個月的四十多塊錢稿費，三十塊錢給房租，十元錢給你去還債，你却做無謂的人情化光了。還要迫我，……」</p>
<p>他差不多徜出淚來，憤怒而悲痛在交流着：</p>
<p>「越老越沒有良心！」</p>
<p>可是，母親却把一件東面碰的一聲扔在地面瘋在了似的躲着脚，搖搖頭的，走來走去的，伸出了滿着皺紋的手在指天指地的，深長地嘆了一口氣：</p>
<p>「都是女人慫恿了你，……」</p>
<p>這一幕心痛的事，使他忘掉了她們的性格所以一天一天怪僻，一天一天的不能够融和的緣故，是社會的困苦的環境關係所造成的。他因爲她們的種種刺激，心中充滿了悲哀的憤恨的交鳴：</p>
<p>「你們老是這樣吵，我再受不住了，我要走呀！」</p>
<p>他以爲自己是出於眞摯的决誓，揉揉疲乏而辣痛的眼珠子，望着母親那瘋在的樣子，嘆了一口氣，垂低了腦袋。</p>
<p>「你就走吧，我也不要這樣不孝的兒子啦。」</p>
<p>這回，他的心中一向的苦悶的火燄眞的冒發出來了。</p>
<p>「我走了，你們別要後悔，別要……」　他一向留戀在這牢獄的家里，從前進的路上退回到這沒落的圈子里，不外想設法維持她們不飢餓吧了，如今，那幻想就夢也似的消失了，那一串一串的回憶，使他眼眶也濕潤了起來。</p>

<h3 id="c216">求得牢飯充飢 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>似乎是有人說過人是在矛盾中討活過的。證之事實，恰是一點兒也沒有錯。不說一個人的思想與思想，思想與行爲是一刻不停的在矛盾，在衝突；卽是歷史與社會的進程，也何不在矛盾向前發展。至於在今日這個混沌的社會經濟組織中，更是到處都暴露着矛盾的事態。比如，「不自由，母寗死」，這是個人類求生的至理名言。我們的祖先，我們的同伴，轟轟烈烈爲着「自由」而奮鬥，而犧牲，以求得集體與個人的生存—自由地。然而在今日，我們却有着許多許多的人羣，有的被强迫着，奴役着盡剝奪了「自由」，有的却是「自願地」（？）出賣了他們的自由，犧牲了自己的自由，以求得暫時的生存。</p>
<p>比方最近，就有一個事實給我們證明：據報載設第一特區捕獲一個竊盜犯。名陳金海，年已三十餘歲；曾因犯竊盜案被第一特區法院判處徒刑三年。去年九月出獄到南京，又犯案被判刑六月；本年二月來滬，又潛入共舞臺及大世界內行竊三次。近被捕獲，解送特院刑一庭，由法官加以審問，陳金海對於累犯竊案，供認不諱，自請求庭上加以重辦，並說：「在外面謀生無着，判罪之後，還可有牢飯充飢」果然，在法官判了他二年徒刑之外，還感到刑期太短呢</p>
<p>坐牢，誰都知道是一種暫時或至終身被剝奪了「自由」的犯罪者的處罰。不說那里的日常生活待過是低下常人幾多倍，就是終日終年的被關禁着不得些微的自由，就是不是人們所願的吧！一個犯罪者的要求庭上從輕發落，减免刑期，許多在牢的犯人，希望遇到「大赦」，早日出牢，「還我自由」，這都是合於情理，很平常的事。而現在却有人自願要求重辦，長期坐牢，這似乎是反於情理的了。然而原因却是「判罪之後，還有牢飯充飢」。</p>
<p>本來，關于「食慾」，不僅是我們人類，大人以至初生的乳兒所不含缺少的機能，也就是一般的動物所共有的賴以生存的先决條件。然而，「吃飯難」，是成了今日一般人的口頭禪了。爲了「吃飯」，人類互相競爭，排擠，以至于犯罪，自殺，互殺……是成了時代所必然的趨勢！所以，明知道坐牢是不得自由，但終還有些「充飢」的束西裝進肚里，可延長了他的生存機能。</p>
<p>在這里我們正不知道在今日的社會組織里，有着多少是像陳金海那樣的人在？更不知道對于這種社會矛盾的事實，有幾多入是注意到，而謀澈底的把牠改着過來？</p>
<h3 id="c217">梭梭灘（上） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>照往常的慣例，把昨天夜里剩餘下來的粗飯，從吊在房簷的底下摘下來，冲了點半熱的水，送下了肚腸。想點鹹菜，在這漫山的遍野里是有相當的困難的，不，卽使是一些極平淡的醬油，也常常缺乏的。</p>
<p>店家，接送的都是些過路的小商人，偶爾的也有些簡單的行旅，在需求上用不着什麽大量的準備，趕一趟集子，能應付過三夭五天，在老鬧的想像里，是不會有接不着氣的危險。可是，這一回，我們這一夥，使得他頭昏，想張羅些醬油之類，但結果依舊是一個失望。</p>
<p>—管他，飯已經喂進了肚子，還管他有菜無菜—阿黃的眼色看了老張一下，這熱識的記號，老張是很淸楚的，跑到前面對兩個小伕頭嘰咕了兩句，，揚起紫褐色的臂膀，拉開那伕子不願意聽進的喉嚨—</p>
<p>—走樓，趕梭梭灘：</p>
<p>於此，我們衝出了正置街，向埋在看不見路的官道上行進。</p>
<p>站在梭梭灘的灘頭，開始有一番考慮，—陸行還是涉水？這兩個問題盤桓在心上，主張得不到一致的結束。最後决定分開了兩條路，歡喜陸行的自便，賀成涉永的隨來，我就在後一組的旗旗之下，跳上了那靠在灘頭的大木船。</p>
<p>伕子的臉子願然的有一個不同的表情，原因是不難推測的，從這里到謝家街的水路二十里，雖說那在伕子的服中）並不算遠的路程，可是生活緊緊地壓在他們的頭頂不容有些微的喘氣，得不到安穩的睡眠，得不到豐滿的油水，求其能得些多餘的休憇，那也是極其不易的，如果能有二十里的休憇，在他們也許要認爲是無上的渥待吧？</p>
<p>之後，一部分人馬帶領了一部份箱件，穿過了密茂的小樹叢，看不見了讓我怎樣的寫呢？那些伕子的臉上存在着共同的不能繪畫的面容呵！</p>
<p>木船上，沒有蓬子一類的設備，很像蘇州河里運貨的船隻，划的人有兩位，一位是掛滿了風霜的老者，另一位却是乳氣未脫的孩童·里面的容量却眞不少，一乘轎子，四乘滑杆，五六個挑擔，外加十幾個渡者，重量也都很可以的</p>
<p>離繫船的地方不遠，河中豎立着一塊大石頭，一面還刻了許多的字，最大的兩字是「神石」，底下就是些關於神石的事蹟。問一下划船的老頭，他覺得那是享有「神」之「氣」的，當暴風雨的夜里，炎夏的天氣捲打着在驟的冰雹，整個的宇宙像要爆炸了一樣，於是「神石」就自天而降，擦過了許多村鎭上建築並不牢固的屋脊，會不損分毫，石頭在咆哮，停落在灘頭的岸邊，讓過往的行旅能展望着牠的雄姿，神石，是有牠相當的價値。</p>
<h3 id="c218">大松林裏 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>江湖上的故事</p>
<p>有一年夏天，我流落到北方一個小城市，在客寓裏突然染了當地一種危險的時症，回想起當時情境，彷彿做了一塲惡事一樣。那種時症是回文的卹名，頗難以記憶的；就是那小城市呌什麽名稱，現在也不能記憶淸楚了，我祇牢記着離那小城市十多里遠有一片大松林，那故事就發生在松林裏，那悲痛的永遠不龍使我忘懐的故事呵！</p>
<p>那小城市被山脈圍繞着的，一到夏天，那種危險的時症就到處蔓延着。我寄住的客寓的掌櫃，在前是綠林出身的，我病倒的時候，他親自用當地的土藥爲我調治，一直延遲到秋凉，我才脫離危險。差不多有半年光景，我沒有付他半文房金飯食，他還慷慨地救了我的性命。當我想繼續着我的流浪生活的時候，他懇切地把我留住了。他說：</p>
<p>「我上半世殺人放火，做了許多缺德的事，現在開這家客寓就想救濟行旅的人來彌補我的罪惡。你年紀輕輕，沒有知道江湖上的黑幕，白送了性命是不値得的，我乾脆想留你下來做我的帮手，不過你眞要走，也不强留你。」</p>
<p>我毫不遲疑地答應他留在店裏，我本來是把生命放在人家的手掌裏到處流浪，我不能辜負了掌櫃的善意，而且在那小城市裏居住下來或許能够增加我的閱歷；因爲每天在那客寓裏進出的都是各式各樣江湖的人物。</p>
<p>日子過得很快，不久便是下着漫天大雪的冬夭了。客寓裏冬天是沒有生意的，因爲那大松林裏已經被一尺多厚的大雪迷失了路道；那大松林又不是個乾凈的地方，過路人常常被割去了頭倒掛在松樹枝上。但是自從開了那家客寓之後，那些謀財害命的事漸漸稀少下來。我在客寓裏住久了，掌櫃的知道我他的歷史；他呌小黃龍，北道上他的名字是很嚮亮的。他像舊小說裹的俠盜一樣，刦富濟貧的，他手下有二百多徒弟，都跟他過活。他洗手的時候，徒弟們竭力反對，他們過慣那種搶却的生活，沒有人願意接收小黃龍分散的錢財照他吩咐的各自做小賣買過活。</p>
<p>那一天又是下着大雪，我們在火盆邊對飲，他把腰際佩着的舊統槍投到桌一子上，指着說：</p>
<p>「就是這枝槍，我打死了我最喜歡的徒弟！也就是他最反對我洗手的！」</p>
<p>熊熊的火燄映着他的紫赤的面頰，他的眼睛不瞬地瞧着我，他流了兩滴淸淚呌了起來：「他和你生得一模一樣，孩子，所以我要你留在這裏，見了你像是他一樣。」</p>
<p>我初次見到一個粗野和女孩兒一般地痛哭，我深深地被他感動了。</p>
<p>「現在」，他接着說：「他們二百多個人分了許多小夥還是做着强盜，但是他們不敢上我這附近來。不過我知道我終有一天要傷在他們手裏，他們恨我切骨似的。」</p>
<p>將要溶雪的時候，客寓裏來了一個客商。他住了兩天，每天總找着小黃龍談夭，他說要到省城去看父親的病，身邊帶着許多銀兩，他不敢孤身穿過那片大松林，但是他沒有說出他的最後要求來。小黃龍却拍着胸脯：</p>
<p>「我懂得你的意思，我店裏有孩子守着，我帮你走走一趟罷！」</p>
<p>第二天他們動身了。臨行時，小黃龍喝了多量的酒，舊統槍裏裝足了子彈，他要我好好地守着店，他送那客商過了大松林馬上回來，至多兩天功夫。</p>
<p>但是第四天還不見他回店。我想起了他痛哭那夜的話，他或許遇着了什麽危險。又是兩天過去，依然不見他的影子，我耐不住了，追到大松林去。因爲已經是溶雪的季節，路上很是濘滑難走，我又不熱識路途，兩天夜迷失在大松林裏，永遠走不出那樹林的範圍。兩天沒有進過一滴米，我已經疲弱得不能走路了，攀了一支細小的樹枝，支撐着兜圈子。我踣倒在地上的時候，我發現了一他們兩個人的衣服，像撕破的旗旗似的高掛在一株大松樹上，一雙乾榭袋就在我的身旁。我一吃飽肚皮，又發瘋似的在松林裏奔走，但是始終找不到他們兩個人的屍身。</p>
<p>這將近是十年的事了，當我下筆寫的時候還像昨天遭過的一樣。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The North China and Kwantung Army military officials' conference was held at the Japanese Army Headquarters in the Tianjin Hai-kuang Temple at 9:00 AM on the 18th. Attendees included Commander Tadashi, Chief of Staff Nagami, and staff officers such as Iimatsu, Muroi, Ishii, Nakai, Hayashi, Kawata, Ikeda, Otake, and Jinbo, as well as attached staff such as Hosoki, Kazuchi, Toyama, Hayama, Ishino, Nodajiri, Matsuoka, Ueno, and Omoto. Special agency chiefs from various locations including Yingkou, Tongzhou, Suiyuan, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou also attended. Chief of Staff Itagaki of the Kwantung Army and Senior Staff Officer Hanada arrived in Tianjin by plane from Jinzhou at 8:00 AM on the 18th to participate. However, their movements were kept secret, and the Japanese side still denied their arrival. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and resumed at 2:00 PM, adjourning again at 4:00 PM. Senior executives are scheduled to meet again on the morning of the 19th to discuss implementation issues. The remaining participants will leave Tianjin tomorrow evening. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The content of the military officials' conference on the 18th included:</p>
<p>* Promoting the clarification of the Hebei-Chahar political power.</p>
<p>* Coordinating with Ambassador Kawagoe's national policy to achieve economic cooperation in North China.</p>
<p>* The attitude that the North China and Kwantung Army departments should adopt towards the Southwest conflict.</p>
<p>* The division of authority between the Kwantung and North China Army departments.</p>
<p>* Monitoring the actions of Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong after his inauguration.</p>
<p>* Preparing special organizations and personnel for extraordinary times. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A preliminary meeting of liaison officers from the Tianjin-based Japanese garrison and the Kwantung Army is being held in Tianjin today. A formal meeting is scheduled for the 19th and 20th to review the current situation in North China and determine specific diplomatic guidelines for North China. This is extremely important. Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Itagaki is scheduled to meet with Ru Geng in Tongzhou tomorrow before flying to Tianjin to participate in the meeting. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Kwantung Army and garrison army held a meeting at the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple, Tianjin, on the morning of the 18th. Attendees included Tadashi, Matsumuro, Nagami, military officials from various locations, Hayama, Omoto, and representatives from the Kwantung Army. The meeting adjourned at noon and continued in the afternoon. It is reported that the Japanese side is discussing coordination and division of authority between the Kwantung Army and the garrison army. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Military official Imai returned to Beiping at 2:00 PM on the 18th after the conference in Tianjin concluded. Military official Ishino returned to Jinan. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is rumored that Kwantung Army Staff Officer Itagaki flew to Tongzhou on the morning of the 18th for inspection and will come to Tianjin on the 20th. (18th Special Dispatch) Negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar issue will continue. Our side will be represented by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. According to a key figure, Chen Zhongfu will come to Beiping to oversee everything. Song Zheyuan decided to come to Tianjin and will take the opportunity to meet with Tadashi for a preliminary meeting. He is expected to return to Beiping after the Dragon Boat Festival. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to visit Japanese garrison commander Tadashi within the next few days for discussions. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Shijiu stated that Song Zheyuan's length of stay in Tianjin is uncertain and that he does not plan to meet with any Japanese representatives. Tadashi and Song have not yet met since Tadashi's arrival. However, whether they will meet is also undecided. Diplomatic matters are at a standstill. Song advocates for negotiations based on the principles of sovereignty, reciprocity, and equality. He is not prepared to negotiate on terms that do not adhere to these principles. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qin Dechun stated that Song Zheyuan came to Tianjin to visit his ancestral hall and reunite with family for the Dragon Boat Festival, so he must return to Beiping after the Dragon Boat Festival. He does not intend to have any diplomatic negotiations in Tianjin. In the future, both sides must have a genuine counterpart and assign responsible persons to negotiate. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will be responsible, and Chen Zhongfu will return soon. Currently, Chen Juesheng is temporarily in charge. Personnel changes in Hebei-Chahar have come to an end. The issue of the Hebei chairmanship is mostly a thing of the past. The situation in the Southwest has an impact on the situation in North China, making it difficult to determine. Although Sugiyama and Kuwashima met in Beiping and had discussions, there was no significant meaning. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After handling personal matters in Tianjin, Song Zheyuan will go to nearby counties to inspect the people's livelihood and plans to visit his ancestral home in Leling to visit relatives. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Kuwashima arrived in Jinan today to visit Han Fuju and will go to Qingdao in the evening before returning to Shanghai, Nanjing, and his country. According to him, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should start with Shandong first, then Hebei. Sino-Japanese relations are no longer in a period for criticism and urgently need to be adjusted. The first way to adjust is that the people of both countries should have a deep understanding of each other. The Japanese should recognize the Chinese national consciousness and national dignity, and the Chinese should recognize the importance of Japan's international position in recent years. The successor to the consul can be stipulated immediately. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 18th, ronin transported 400 tons of rayon and 300 bags of white sugar, forcibly occupying car number 3110 of the Jinpu Railway to transport them to Jinan. The trade association organized by the ronin has already transported several batches of smuggled goods to Datong and other areas in northern Shanxi. Because the members are barbaric and unreasonable, no one can stop the smuggling, and it is rampant again. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lin Shize stated that after Ahn Si-woon arrived, he cooperated with all parties to carry out anti-smuggling efforts, which has been somewhat effective. He hopes that the citizens will rise up and help. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Over 600 packages of smuggled goods arrived today. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Qin Dechun Represents Song Zheyuan to Administer Oath</p>
<p>Political Council Orders Liu Ruming to Serve as Acting Chairman of Chahar</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong took office as Mayor of Tianjin at 10:00 AM on the 18th. Guests included Wang Yitang, Chen Juesheng, Lin Shize, Tianjin gentry, and directors of various bureaus, totaling over 600 people. The ceremony was very simple. The National Flag was hung on the back wall of the Municipal Government's large living room. There were no items such as reading of wills or moments of silence. Qin Dechun delivered a speech on behalf of Song Zheyuan, divided into three points: 1. The people are the foundation of the state, and politics should prioritize the welfare of the people. Love what the people love, and hate what the people hate. 2. Good governance relies on integrity. It is hoped that everyone will advance with a spirit of integrity. 3. Tianjin is important for diplomacy. It is appropriate to base it on the principles of good neighborliness and mutual benefit, and make plans for amity and harmony. Respect each other with courtesy, and contend with reason when there is something. Zhang Zizhong then gave a reply, stating: 1. He will never speak biased words or harbor selfish opinions, and will build an incorruptible government. 2. He will absolutely be responsible for maintaining law and order, prospering the market, improving the appearance of the city, and seeking public welfare. 3. He will strive for diplomacy based on coexistence, co-prosperity, good neighborliness, and mutual benefit. 4. He will not change personnel arbitrarily, and will strive to make the best use of everyone's talents. The ceremony was completed at 11:00 AM with a group photo. Zhang immediately met with his subordinates and received foreign guests. He will visit foreign consuls within the next few days. Shi Jisheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, resigned and will be replaced by Ma Yanchong, Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. He took office at 3:00 PM and gave a speech to the officials on behalf of Zhang. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Political Council today announced a decree approving Xiao Zhenying's resignation as Mayor of Tianjin. He should still be responsible for his positions as a member of the Political Council and Chairman of the Economic Committee. Zhang Zizhong was transferred to Tianjin to succeed him, and Liu Ruming will be in charge of Chahar. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Liu Ruming received the order from the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to concurrently serve as Acting Chairman of Chahar, Liu needed to consult with Song Zheyuan on important matters. He is scheduled to go to Tianjin in the next day or two to meet with Song, then return to Beiping and then go to Zhangjiakou to take office. Liu specially dispatched Tian Wenqi, commander of the 3rd Brigade of his division, to Zhangjiakou this morning to make arrangements for everything. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei-Chahar Political Council formally announced three orders on the 18th, stating in brief: 1. Xiao Zhenying's request to resign as Mayor of Tianjin should be approved. 2. Zhang Zizhong is appointed to fill the vacancy left by the Mayor of Tianjin. 3. Liu Ruming is appointed to temporarily concurrently serve in the vacancy left by Zhang Zizhong as Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Committee. Furthermore, regarding Xiao Zhenying's resignation from all concurrent positions, the Political Council only approved his resignation as Mayor of Tianjin. His positions as a member of the Political Council and Chairman of the Economic Committee were not approved. Xiao is still recuperating at the Summer Palace and has declined all social engagements. Whether he will resign from his other positions is still undecided. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch) Zhangjiakou: All departments of the Chahar Provincial Government have been rushing to hand over affairs. All provincial committee members telegraphed Liu Ruming on the 18th, welcoming him to come to Chahar to take charge of the administration as soon as possible. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>* The central government will allocate a special fund of 10 million yuan to Guangdong Province to compensate for losses incurred from the exchange of banknotes. At the same time, banknotes issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank will continue to circulate.</p>
<p>* Guangdong's silver reserves will be kept in the custody of the Paper Currency Issuance Supervision Committee, which will have the right to purchase the same amount of "Dayuan" banknotes from the banks of the central government with 30 million silver dollars.

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, as the new organization of the Ministry of Finance is about to be implemented, will take advantage of the reorganization to improve the structure of tax collection agencies such as customs, salt, and consolidated tax.

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong, as the principle of establishing an income tax has been approved by the Central Political Council, in order for the tax to be collected as soon as possible, in addition to ordering the original draft of the Income Tax Regulations to be revised in accordance with the principles of the Central Political Council for reference by the legislative authorities, will also appoint several officials to prepare the procedures for the collection of the tax in advance. The date of tax collection will depend on the time it takes to complete the legislative process of the case. If the Legislative Yuan can pass these before the summer recess, then collection can begin in July or August of this year. At that time, the whole country will also be held at the same time, because the Central Political Council's principles did not adopt a regional trial system. The Ministry of Finance believes that since the tax is a new tax, in order to develop a good foundation, scientific methods and specialized personnel will be used to handle it. The first year's tax revenue has been approved for 5 million yuan in the national budget for the 25th year. It is reported that after the income tax is established, a separate method will be set for the central government's collection of income donations. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Agricultural Foundation Bureau and Rural Relief <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>The organizational regulations of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau have been approved at the Executive Yuan meeting a few days ago. According to the eager expectations of all parties, the establishment of the bureau should not be far off. Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the banking community have already had full consultations and research beforehand, it seems that there should not be any difficulty in raising funds. The reporter believes that the establishment of the bureau is an urgent matter. However, after studying the organizational regulations, it seems that this organization, which bears the huge responsibility of rural relief, must have more precise planning.</p>
<p>Rural relief is inherently a complex and difficult matter. The important points are economic assistance, production and sales coordination, and improvement of production technology. Now, the mission of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, according to the regulations, is to "adjust the circulation of agricultural products and agricultural funds." In the above three points, all except the technical aspect are within its scope of work. Article 5 of the Regulations stipulates that the Agricultural Products Department will handle the adjustment of agricultural products, and the Agricultural Loan Department will handle rural financial relief. On the surface, the planning is well-organized. However, there are many aspects involved in coordinating production and sales relationships, and it has already been said that it is not easy to achieve results. In recent years, the Shanghai banking community and the farmers' banks in various provinces have also made many efforts in rural financial relief, but in this year's report of the Bank of China, it is evaluated as "only contributing a drop in the ocean." It is not easy to see here that even if the Agricultural Foundation Bureau is a unified agency, it should first determine the steps for work progress in order to achieve satisfactory results in the above two points.</p>
<p>The so-called steps for work progress refer to the priority and sequence of various matters that should be handled in business. The nine matters that should be handled by the Agricultural Products and Agricultural Loan Departments of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau seem easy but are actually difficult. It is impossible to advance all at once. In order to achieve results, it is necessary to see which are the most important, which are the secondary ones, which have already been handled by other agencies and do not need special attention, and which are urgent and must be worked on diligently. For example, in terms of product marketing, the most that cannot be carried out without political power should be presided over by the Agricultural Foundation Bureau with full force. If loans and product mortgages, etc. have been handled by previous banks</p>
<p>(Changsha) The advanced units of the Guangdong Army, which entered Chenzhou, Hunan Province, some days ago, have been successively withdrawn and concentrated in Xiaotang. The Guangxi Army is still concentrated in Lingling and has not retreated further. It is also reported that the Guangxi Army is purchasing goods in various counties in southern Hunan, mostly using Guangxi currency. Prices have fallen and people have suffered unspeakably. In addition, the gasoline at the bus station in Qiyang and Yongzhou has been taken away. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang is scheduled to summon various generals back to the province within a few days, to instruct the army on post-retreat plans. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Bai Chongxi sent Wang Kuangpei as a representative to Hunan to report on the progress of the expedition and telegrammed He for coordination. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Promotion Association of the All-Province Muslim Association of Shanxi telegraphed Bai Chongxi on the 17th, stating that the Guangdong-Guangxi army's dispatch to fight the Japanese is a partial movement. Although the name is righteous, it is inevitable that there will be suspicion of division. Please withdraw the troops and wait for the opportunity and take unified action with the central government. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Since Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and Sha Jiazhe, Secretary of the Southwest Political Committee, explained everything to President Jiang in Nanjing yesterday, the relationship between Nanjing and Guangdong has gradually improved. According to the two, the Guangdong authorities fully support the central government and stated that Chen Jitang is now focusing on the construction of the province. It is learned that Chen has telegraphed Wang Chonghui, expressing his agreement on the necessity of national unity to resist aggression. The banking community in Guangzhou believes that the Guangdong province will adopt the use of national currency once the political issues are resolved. They believe that this move could stabilize the finance. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Guangxi Army Still Concentrated in Lingling</p>
<p>(Changsha) Changsha today received disquieting news from various sources regarding the central government and the Southwest. Due to differences in opinion, the situation remains in a stalemate. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Li Zongren has telegraphed Bai Chongxi, ordering him to be fully responsible for Guangxi's military affairs. Bai's wife, who resided in Guangzhou for some time, has returned to Nanning by plane today. The anti-Japanese movement in Guangzhou is now strengthened. It is rumored that Zou Lu has returned from his trip to Europe to attend the Second Plenary Session. Well-informed sources do not believe this, saying that Zou is currently in Italy visiting Mussolini and will not be able to return before the meeting on July 10. Various circles in China are still afraid that war will be inevitable. It is heard that several Guangxi armies have occupied the dangerous military locations of Yongzhou, and that the Guangxi army authorities have appointed Weng Zhaoyuan as the commander of the First Division of the Guangxi Anti-Japanese Army. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to well-informed Chinese sources in Hong Kong, the recent actions of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have put the country in a state of civil war. However, the general public is doubtful as to whether the two will obey the central government and not resist. Everyone believes that Nanjing is willing to assist the Southwest provinces financially. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: Due to internal disputes in the Guangdong army, the troops are withdrawing westward to Yizhang. The Guangxi army, which previously temporarily withdrew to Yongzhou out of necessity, suddenly emerged from Lengshuitan yesterday and advanced towards Wugang and Baoqing, because Bai Chongxi still wants to coerce Guangdong-Chen to jointly advance north. (18th Shen Shi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hong Kong and Guangdong have been falsely claiming for days that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies in southern Hunan have gradually withdrawn, but yesterday it was widely reported that the Guangxi army's Xia Wei troops continued to advance towards Qiyang. It is difficult to ascertain the truth. Therefore, the central government has found it hard to believe that the armies of Guangdong and Guangxi have already withdrawn. On the central government's side, it is hoped that the Guangdong-Guangxi authorities can sincerely and concretely express their attitude, withdraw their troops back to their defenses, and send personnel to Beijing to attend the Second Plenary Session to discuss all major plans. Therefore, the future of the current situation depends on whether the authorities in the two provinces make a sincere expression. (18th Shen Shi Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is rumored that the Guangxi army in southern Hunan has recently advanced again, and that the military transport between the provincial capital and Shaoguan has not stopped. It is said that the withdrawal of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi in recent days is just a kind of propaganda to the outside world, because the authorities, in view of the questioning of the people in various places, deliberately created a smokescreen to cover up the truth and ease the situation. The provincial government has held repeated important meetings in recent days, and the organization of the government is still under consideration. The anxiety of the people in the market has not diminished, and it is generally believed that the future is not optimistic. (18th Shen Shi News)</p>

<p>President Jiang has Replied by Telegram, Explaining the Central Government's Attitude A certain gentleman of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement to reporters on the 18th: The Executive Yuan has recently received many telegrams from chambers of commerce and university professors in various places, all of whom believe that today is the time to unite sincerely to complete unification, and that it is absolutely inappropriate to act independently and fight among ourselves. They request that the central government find ways to prevent this. Upon investigation of this matter, President Jiang replied to the telegrams from Shanghai and Tianjin a few days ago, clearly stating that the national situation is in danger, and that we cannot resist insults without unity. The central government has scheduled the Second Plenary Session and has repeatedly telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi generals, ordering them to send responsible personnel to Beijing to jointly discuss plans to save the country and survive, in the hope of interacting with each other in good faith and eliminating hidden dangers, which is exactly the same as the intention of the gentlemen. It is hoped that people will share this heart, abide by order, and overcome difficulties together. The telegrams received at this time have roughly the same meaning, which shows that the people of the country have a long patriotic heart and a unified opinion, which is very gratifying and admirable. The central government's attitude has already been understood by all parties. It is hoped that all provinces will cherish unity and follow the correct path to consolidate the national foundation.

<p>In Accordance With All Banks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Bank inquired with the Ministry of Finance as to whether the Central Savings Association and the Central Trust Bureau should pay reserve requirements in the same manner as other banks. The Ministry of Finance replied that the Savings Association and the Trust Bureau should pay reserve requirements in the same manner as all banks. (18th Special Dispatch) Commercial banks and credit cooperatives are mostly managed with experience and results. The Agricultural Foundation Bureau only needs to supervise them so that they can increase their effectiveness. In this way, the Agricultural Foundation Bureau has the convenience of concentrating its energy on governing the overall business, and the benefits obtained in the progress of the work should be extraordinary.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Foundation Bureau, as its name suggests, should bear a major responsibility for rural relief. However, on the other hand, if the responsibility is too heavy and not fulfilled, it will be of no benefit and will only invite disappointment. There have been years of discussion in the country about rural relief. In the past, the government also set up a rural revival agency. What the results were is self-explanatory. The reporter deeply hopes that the establishment of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau will not repeat the same mistakes and can achieve practical benefits.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Finance stated that sugar has been designated as one of the types of imported goods subject to inspection in order to prevent smuggling. For all imported sugar, evidence of customs payment and a transportation and sales license must be obtained in accordance with the law before transportation can begin. However, for domestic local sugar, it seems difficult to carry out inspection procedures due to the lack of tax payment certificates. The ministry is currently studying remedial measures. Feng Rui's visit to Nanjing this time was also to propose to the ministry alternative inspection measures for the transportation and sale of sugar cane, but no concrete results have been achieved.

<h3 id="e58">British House of Commons Discusses Diplomacy - Foreign Secretary Announces Lifting of Sanctions <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Measures Remain Effective - Opposition MPs Mostly Denounce as Shameful</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons met today to debate foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a passionate speech announcing the government's readiness to lift sanctions against Italy. Members of the opposition party shouted "Shameful" and "Resign" in response.</p>
<p>Every seat in the visitors' gallery of the House today was occupied. The Foreign Secretary's speech quoted the British government as having repeatedly taken the lead in Geneva and will continue to do so in the future. When asked how the League of Nations would handle it, the Foreign Secretary replied that we must admit that the purpose of the sanctions has not been achieved. After careful consideration, the government has decided not to use sanctions as a method of oppressing Italy. As Foreign Secretary, I believe it is my duty to make this recommendation.</p>
<p>After the shouts of "Shameful" and "Resign" subsided, the Foreign Secretary continued, stating that the government believes that the British guarantees under Article 16, Section 2, of the League of Nations Covenant regarding the Mediterranean shall not be terminated as a result of the lifting of sanctions. During the unstable period that is bound to follow the lifting of sanctions, these guarantees should remain in effect. The government does not consider the events that these guarantees were made to prevent to be a fantasy and believes that they will definitely not occur. The government intends to maintain these guarantees as long as they are beneficial to the overall situation. Based on the experience of the past few months, the government has decided that we should permanently maintain a stronger defensive position in the Mediterranean than before the current dispute arose. This declaration will be implemented in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then mentioned Hitler's peace proposals, saying that the government felt that the German government's questions to the British government should be answered as soon as possible. The government firmly believes that the German reply will enable negotiations to proceed, which is the primary goal that the government wishes to see realized. (To be continued, the debate was still in progress at the time of the dispatch.) (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cabinet Decides to Lift Sanctions - Opposition Parties Will Launch Fierce Attacks</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons is scheduled to debate foreign policy today. The government will explain the issue of lifting sanctions, which everyone is eagerly awaiting. It is rumored that there is no real question of Foreign Secretary Eden resigning and that he will deliver a passionate speech explaining and supporting the government's preparation to lift sanctions. Eden will speak first, followed by speeches from the anti-government Labor Party's Clydesdale and the anti-government Liberal Party's Sir Sinclair. Then, Lloyd George will speak, fiercely criticizing the government's support for lifting sanctions. The anti-government Labor Party leader Attlee will continue George's attack on the government. Finally, Prime Minister Baldwin will speak to conclude the debate, which will end at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Paris, the Blum Socialist government, although unwilling to initiate the lifting of sanctions against Italy, intends to reluctantly follow in the footsteps of the British government.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Rome, although political circles are silent, it is generally felt that once the "stigma" of sanctions is removed, Italy will inevitably cooperate with European countries again. It is now believed that the main purpose of Mussolini's foreign policy is to conclude a four-power agreement between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. This will be a "supra-regional" agreement and will set a model for other countries to conclude agreements in this way. It has been rumored that after the lifting of sanctions, Italy's foreign trade may discriminate between countries that have imposed sanctions and those that have not. The Italian authorities have denied this, but have stated that Italy now produces many goods that it previously relied on from foreign countries, so the total amount of imports will naturally decrease in the future. Germany has already sent representatives here to hold business negotiations and may first join the countries that participated in the sanctions and sign new business agreements with Italy. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met this afternoon to discuss the sanctions issue and decided that the current sanctions measures should be completely lifted. The Cabinet adopted this decision for several reasons, one of the more important of which is that the Italian side has clearly indicated that if the current sanctions measures continue to be implemented, the country will withdraw from the League of Nations and issue a national mobilization order as an emergency measure. The Cabinet meeting lasted for two hours and was initiated by Foreign Secretary Eden with the following three main arguments: 1. The experts of the Foreign Office believe that the sole purpose of the sanctions measures is to eliminate the war. However, they have not shortened the duration of the war in Ethiopia. Now that the Italo-Ethiopian war has ended, there is no provision in the League of Nations Covenant that the sanctions measures should continue to be implemented after the war. If they are still maintained, they will only give the sanctions measures a punitive meaning, which not only contradicts the original intention of the Covenant but also Italy will regard it as a hostile act. This danger cannot be ignored. 2. Since the sanctions measures are the only obstacle for Italy to rejoin the collective organization, they should be lifted in view of the current diplomatic situation in Europe. What is the situation? (A) Germany is sparing no effort to rearm itself, causing considerable anxiety to Britain. (B) Germany's statement on the British issue does not mention a reply. (C) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may eventually be forced to reach an understanding with German leader Hitler, allowing Germany to act freely within Czechoslovakia in exchange for Germany's promise to maintain the status quo in Austria. 3. The British government has hesitated on the issue of lifting sanctions measures for a long time, and Britain's prestige has been affected as a result. In order to restore prestige, it should immediately decide to lift them. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Mussolini Decides to Review</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet met today and decided to support the lifting of sanctions against Italy at the upcoming meeting of the League of Nations Council and Assembly next week. Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden attended the Cabinet meeting. It is reported that Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all agree with this action, with only the Union of South Africa opposing it. According to diplomatic sources, encouraged by this decision by Britain, Mussolini has decided to go further and ask the League of Nations to lift its designation of Italy as an "aggressor" and to revoke Ethiopia's membership in the League of Nations.

<p>Will Further Demand Recognition of Aggression</p>
<p>(Rome) The British Cabinet held a Cabinet meeting this afternoon and decided to lift the sanctions measures against Italy. Official sources said that they did not find this strange, but that even after the sanctions measures were lifted, Italy would not be satisfied and would have to go further and clearly recognize Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. The Abyssinian issue must be resolved one day or another, and the international tension will not be alleviated. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Semi-official sources recently declared that many of the trade agreements previously concluded by Italy with various countries had been terminated by Italy one after another since the implementation of the sanctions measures against Italy on November 18th last year. Now that the sanctions measures have been lifted, it is impossible to renew these trade agreements in the same way as before, because Italy's economic policy must be completely changed. In general, when Italy concludes new agreements with various countries in the future, it will base them on novel principles, or even adopt a barter system. Germany has already sent representatives here to hold business negotiations and may first join the countries that participated in the sanctions and sign new business agreements with Italy.

In addition, it is generally believed that since the League of Nations has failed, it should be reorganized based on the following two points: 1. The principle of regional organization of security agencies, 2. That is, the amendment to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant passed by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1921.

<h3 id="e65">The Austrian Restoration Question <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Vienna) Archduke Eugene, the uncle of Archduke Otto von Habsburg, the heir to the Austrian throne, has remained silent on the issue of Austrian restoration. Today, while addressing a veterans' convention in Lienz, Tyrol, he stated: "The Austrian people will have the opportunity this autumn to express their support for or opposition to the monarchy. There is no doubt that the majority of the people will decide to support Archduke Otto as monarch. The young king could have returned to the country earlier, but he does not want to set foot on Austrian soil until a powerful, large group of Austrians requests his return." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Archduke Otto von Habsburg, the heir to the Austrian throne, issued a declaration today stating that he is waiting for the people to welcome him back to the country. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini supports the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy and has established an Italo-Austrian cooperation agreement. Mussolini believes that the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy is the only practical solution to Austria's disputes. Italy has returned forty train carloads of cannons seized from Austria during the European War to Austria, but military authorities still deny this. Observers say that Chancellor Schuschnigg will do everything possible to promote the restoration in order to save Austria. Recently, public sentiment has been quite tense regarding the restoration of Archduke Otto, and monarchists held a celebration in Linz on Wednesday, to which Otto's sister, Princess Adelheid, and his uncle, Archduke Eugene, were invited. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The semi-official Federal Postal Newspaper recently published a statement saying that the restoration of the former Habsburg dynasty is regarded in Austria as purely an internal affair. "According to current articles, there is nothing to prevent Austria from freely choosing its political system." This is also the sentiment in Italy. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Politische Auslands-Korrespondenz recently commented on the plan to restore the former Habsburg dynasty in Austria, stating, "This move is not a natural result of political evolution, but rather a kind of experiment whose dangerous nature could shake the situation in Central Europe." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy is very pleased that Germany and Austria can be expected to reach a compromise soon. It is said that Prime Minister Mussolini met with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg on the fifth of this month with the aim of bringing Germany and Austria back to normal relations through Italian mediation. Currently, Italo-German relations are extremely harmonious, and the issue of Austrian independence may be resolved definitively as a result. However, no political agreement has yet been signed between Italy and Germany, as it is feared that such an agreement, once established, would only strengthen the unity of the countries imposing sanctions and delay the lifting of the sanctions. Well-informed sources say that, in general, after the current sanctions are lifted, relations between Italy and the countries imposing sanctions can return to a friendly state, especially between Britain and Italy, which should quickly move closer, which does not contradict the close relations between Italy and Germany. (Havas, 17th)</p>

The committee immediately resolved to request that the government take all necessary measures for the sake of national defense so that all public utilities would use charcoal instead of liquid fuels.

<p>Joint Meeting of Labor and Management Acknowledges Workers' Demands</p>
<p>Brussels – At a joint meeting of labor and management held today under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Janson, the management made the following concessions to the workers: an eight-hour workday, a minimum wage of 32 francs, a 40-hour workweek for unsanitary factories, one week of annual leave with pay, and seniority bonuses for long-term employees. These concessions will be recognized by a mixed committee on Thursday so that factories across the country can resume work on Monday of next week. However, the strike movement is still spreading, and the situation is still far from optimistic. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The labor strike is still spreading and has now reached the capital. A factory announced a strike today. A small group of unemployed workers marched through the city this morning, chanting slogans in support of a general strike, in response to the strikes in the provinces. Mayor Max has warned the public that no meetings or parades may be held in the capital without his permission. At the same time, the Minister of Justice has warned foreigners not to take any actions that would disrupt public order, otherwise they will be immediately deported. The meeting between Prime Minister Janson, the Minister of Labor, the Minister of the Interior, and representatives of labor and management has still failed to find a solution to the labor strike. The workers' demand for a 40-hour workweek is the main obstacle. It is hoped that a compromise can be reached next week and that work can be fully resumed. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The strike situation in the provinces is growing. Fortunately, the capital has not been affected. However, even today, there are signs of instability in the capital. The Janson cabinet recently advised the workers to return to work quickly. The local union federation has ordered workers in the capital to join the strike. In addition, workers were arrested in the ports of Antwerp and Liège yesterday, many of whom were foreigners. The Ministry of the Interior recently issued a notice stating that in the future, foreign workers who join demonstrations or participate in disturbances will be deported, regardless of the severity of the circumstances, as a warning.

<p>Madrid – The labor strike has been going on for many days, and disturbances broke out again yesterday, resulting in many injuries. Interior Minister Moles has ordered the closure of the anarchist labor union. (Note: There are two labor unions in Spain: the socialist labor union and the anarchist labor union.) The strike is threatening to spread throughout the country. The number of strikers in Barcelona has reached no less than 100,000, and there is still room for expansion. It is expected that private factories and wholesale stores will be affected. The demands of the strikers include four items: implementation of a 40-hour workweek, a six-hour workday in summer, equal pay for female workers, and the establishment of an unemployment relief fund.

<p>21 Observation Stations in Japan, 17 in Russia; Cloudy Weather in Japan, Villagers Pray for Sunshine</p>
<p>Jiehua (Karafuto) – The shadow of the sun being obscured will appear at 1:30 p.m. on the 19th. Since the morning of the 18th, the skies over the Kitami area have been covered with dense clouds, and the 21 international observation posts are busy with final preparations in the gloomy weather. The villagers are also looking up at the sky, hoping for clear weather, and some are even going to the shrine to pray. The situation is particularly tense. According to reports, the unfavorable weather is due to a low-pressure system remaining over 738 miles in northern Sakhalin. Therefore, the skies throughout the island are cloudy. The temperature is high and clear only near Jiehua, but this is only temporary. Therefore, if the low-pressure system remains stationary on the 19th, there will still be clouds, but the weather may clear up slightly in the afternoon. However, the international astronomers who have set up a row of telescopes and cannons in the Kitami area of Hokkaido, waiting for the two-minute total eclipse, are praying to God for two minutes of clear weather based on this pessimistic forecast. (Domei News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) For the solar eclipse on June 19, the Soviet Union will divide seventeen locations from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean, with 28 Soviet teams and 12 foreign teams conducting observations. Krasnoyarsk will use airplanes and stratospheric balloons to observe the solar eclipse. Krasnor will release four radio probes to measure solar power. Soviet radio stations will broadcast news in Russian, French, and English from five observation sites at 6:30 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. Moscow time. The broadcast station names are as follows: R.K.K., wavelength 25.04 meters; R.K.I., wavelength 19.76 meters; R.N.E., wavelength 24.99 meters; R.A.N., wavelength 21.51 meters; and Komintern, wavelength 1.724 meters.

<p>(London) Dr. Ma, the commissioner of the Chinese Judicial Yuan, has completed his two-month investigation of the judicial system in England and is leaving for France today. Before coming to England, Ma conducted a similar close investigation in the United States. He will continue his investigation in France, Germany, and Italy. Before his departure, Ma met with a Reuters reporter and said that he had long talks with Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, and the President of the Court of Appeal. Later, he attended hearings in the House of Lords and observed trials in various courts, and he was deeply moved by the solemn spirit of handling cases. He was particularly impressed by the juvenile court, believing that it was a particularly beneficial institution that could prevent children from becoming incorrigible criminals. He visited the Womhu Reformatory, and he felt that its facilities were like a school and could not be regarded as a prison, providing criminals with a way to rehabilitate themselves. Ma felt that the judicial concepts of England and China had many similarities, but the jury system in England was different from that in China. This should be emulated. He also said that he received detailed guidance everywhere he went and benefited greatly. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

However, according to the Australian government's reply, (1) the new tariffs will still be applied, and (2) although there are two types of tariffs in the new tariffs, high and low, Japanese goods will not be subject to the low tariff rate, which is equivalent to preventing the import of Japanese goods. The Australian response has no room for compromise, so Japan has no choice but to implement the Trade Protection Law." (Domei News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The invocation of the Trade Protection Law against Australia was scheduled to be discussed and reviewed on the 19th and implemented on the same day. Previously, because the procedures for the emergency imperial ordinance bill and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry ordinance bill from the Bureau of Legislation and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had not been completed, they could not be completed before the 19th, so the postponement will be extended to the cabinet meeting on the 20th or the regular cabinet meeting on the 23rd.

<p>Putian County is the Center of Smuggling. A Certain Country's Warships Escort Smuggled Imports</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The coastal areas of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in southern Fujian are separated from Taiwan by a narrow strip of water, and the practice of smuggling is extremely prevalent. Putian County is even more of a smuggling center. At present, private goods occupy the markets in Putian and Xianyou counties. The ports of Fengting, Shanxi, Dumen, and Zhu Zhai in Xianyou, Taihu, Dongsha, Dongfen, Xiuyu, Zou Zeng, and Xu Zhelang in the third district of Putian, Zhongmen, Zhulin, Yuexiu, Wu Cha, Ku Zhu, and Pu Xi in the fourth district, Qiantou, Pinghai, Xiang, Chi Cen, and Dai Tou in Pinghai, and Jiangkou in the second district of Putian are flooded with smuggled goods. According to investigations, the number of smuggled goods exceeds more than twice the number of goods declared at Jiangkou. Previously, most private merchants owned or rented sailboats to directly go to the opposite shore to purchase goods and then transfer them to various ports for unloading. Recently, because customs anti-smuggling boats patrol the sea from time to time, they dare not test the law. However, a certain country is further supporting the奸 merchants in various ports. For all transactions, if there is a considerable introduction or guarantee, they can pay for the goods first and agree on a time to repay the price. Even huge sums of thousands or tens of thousands can be loaned. They also send small motorboats to transport smuggled goods to the port for unloading. If it is a large amount, they can negotiate for warships to patrol the sea under false pretenses, but in reality, they provide cover. This is the origin of the strange ships without nationality that have been repeatedly discovered in Putian recently. On the 13th, two strange ships were discovered again on the sea off Beishicheng, Pinghai, staying for half a day before leaving. After the smuggled goods are unloaded, they are mostly scattered and hoarded in nearby villages, and then sold to small-scale smugglers. Most of those engaged in small-scale smuggling are in Donghua, Dongjiao, Zou Zeng, and Xu Shanxiang in the third district of Putian, Zhongmen and Pinghai in the fourth district, and Jiangkou in the second district. The method of carrying and transporting is mostly affixed with dark and dirty old business tax certificates or stamps to deceive people. They collude with local ruffians and hooligans in various towns and lower-level personnel of various agencies or tax bureau inspectors, so very few cases are solved. Occasionally, when a case is solved, there are relevant documents for verification, and the skills involved are not clear to outsiders. As for the wholesale price of smuggled goods, the current price of kerosene is 2.8 yuan per barrel, while private vendors sell it to shops for 3.8 yuan or 4 yuan. Sugar can earn a profit of 2 yuan to 2.5 yuan per load. Matches can earn a profit of 1.5 yuan per box. With such great profits, people are competing to flock to it. At present, Putian, Xianyou, Yongchun, Yongtai, and other places, whether in cities and towns or in villages, are filled with smuggled goods. The provincial government has now established a provincial tax inspection office, and a seventh patrol office has been specially established in Putian, with director Huang Bozhi already arriving in Putian to set up an office. There is an armed anti-smuggling team to combat smuggling. It is unknown whether smuggling can be reduced in the future. (June 26, 18th)</p>

<p>Dalu Bao, Qinhuangdao correspondence, June 12: Not long ago, one night, a Japanese steamship of about 500 tons entered the port, carrying 596 bags of sugar. Customs officials immediately boarded the ship for questioning. The captain claimed that he intended to sail to Changli, one of the headquarters for smugglers on the coast. Customs officials asked if he intended to pay customs duties on the sugar on board. The captain replied that he did not want to, and said that all he knew was that he had to pay taxes in eastern Hebei, and that he did not have to pay other taxes outside of that. Therefore, customs officials informed him that the customs had no other choice but to confiscate the steamship and the sugar on board. The sugar on the ship was then moved ashore and stored in the customs warehouse, and later sold to a Shanghai merchant for 14,600 yuan. At the same time, two Japanese people came to Qinhuangdao to visit the customs authorities. One of the two claimed to be the chairman of the Lushunkou Chamber of Commerce, specially coming to Qinhuangdao to ask the customs to return the ship and cargo together. The other person was the ship's owner, and the goods on board belonged to a certain Korean person. The ship was also rented by the Korean person. He did not know that the person renting the ship was planning to smuggle. Before the ship was rented in Lushunkou, he and the shipowner both knew that the customs of Qinhuangdao had stopped working, and that after paying taxes in eastern Hebei, they could sail directly into Qinhuangdao. The ship sailed directly to Qinhuangdao and planned to unload the goods at the port, etc. Thereupon, the customs authorities said that the captain seemed to know that he was engaged in smuggling, because when the ship and cargo were detained, he had explained that he planned to sail to Changli. The customs authorities also said that although the ship clearly seemed to have sailed in temporarily to take refuge, since it was carrying smuggled goods, the customs had to confiscate it, so in any case, the ship or cargo could not be returned. Thereupon, the two Japanese people left the customs disgruntled. However, before setting off from Qinhuangdao to return to Lushunkou, they had clearly reported the matter to the Japanese Consulate Police. The chief of the Japanese Consulate Police then came to the customs, firmly claiming that the ship had only sailed into Qinhuangdao for temporary refuge, and the customs had no right to confiscate it, but he had been instructed that since the ship had been confiscated, he did not want to recover it by force. At that time, the customs had removed the ship's wheels, compass, and certain parts to prevent it from escaping under its own power. The customs did not seem to care about the warning from the police chief. Around 4:30 in the morning one day, two motorboats, clearly driven by Korean people, sailed into the port under the cover of darkness, approached the steamship, and tied cables to it to tow it out to sea. When customs officials arrived for work in the morning, they saw that the steamship was already like a small black dot, sailing towards Lushunkou.</p>

<p>Bandit Gangs on the Border of Jiangsu and Shandong Negotiate Surrender</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Yaoting, the captain of the special investigation team of the Third Route Army, has solved major cases in Shandong for several years. Famous bandit leaders have been arrested and executed one after another. Recently, Liu also learned that Liu Huaizhi, the puppet army commander of the bandit Liu Guitang, took advantage of the unstable situation to sneak into the Feixian area of southern Shandong, secretly engaging in activities with the intention of disrupting public order. He immediately led a special investigation to Feixian and captured Liu Huaizhi. Liu Huaizhi was Liu Guitang's most trusted number one henchman. When he was recruited last time, Liu Guitang was made a brigade commander, and Liu Huaizhi was appointed as the commander of the first regiment. After Liu Yaoting captured Liu Huaizhi, he telegraphed a report of everything to Han Fuqu. Han ordered that he be handed over to the Feixian County Government for interrogation according to law. Liu Qingyun and Ma Huaian, two famous water bandit gangs on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu, with a total of more than 30 people, recently expressed regret and surrendered to Liu Yaoting, and have handed over their guns, requesting to be reorganized to serve the local area. Therefore, Liu Yaoting took the 306th Pingpu train from Jining to Jinan at about 10:00 a.m. on the 16th, and went to the Provincial Government in the afternoon to meet with Han Fuqu to report and inquire about the reorganization of the surrendered bandits. According to Liu Yaoting, the lakes and fields in the border area of Shandong and Jiangsu are vast, and it is easy for bandits to hide. Our team has repeatedly gone to suppress them severely, but the bandits are cunning by nature, and this suppression leads to that escape. It is extremely difficult to eliminate them completely. Now, Liu Qingyun and Ma Huaian, two famous water bandit gangs on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu, with a total of more than 30 people, have petitioned to surrender. They have sent personnel to the team to negotiate, and have handed over two rifles, five pistols, and two box guns, expressing their sincerity. We are currently handling all the formalities, and in the future, we will be able to hand over all the firearms and ammunition, forty or fifty pairs, completely. I recently went to the Jixiang area to inspect, and the local area is still very peaceful. This time, I returned to Jinan to meet with Chairman Han to ask for instructions, and will return to Jining within a few days. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Amidst the Anti-Japanese Movement in the Two Guangs, the Japanese Consul in Guangdong Sends a Letter of Inquiry <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Southwest authorities issued an anti-Japanese telegram, the armies of the two Guangs also mobilized at the same time. Although the central government has been advising restraint recently, troops are still stationed on the border between Guangxi and Guangdong. The anti-Japanese sentiment among the people in the two Guangs is even more intense. Students in Guangxi Province took the lead in staging anti-Japanese demonstrations, and people from all walks of life in Guangdong also held a large anti-Japanese parade a few days ago. Because of the above-mentioned expressions, the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou was provoked to send a letter of inquiry, believing that this move would hinder Sino-Japanese relations. The special envoy of foreign affairs in the two Guangs has already replied reasonably. The letter from the Japanese Consul is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou: Dear Sir, Since the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee issued an anti-Japanese telegram on June 2, Your Commander-in-Chief and others, in the name of responsible people in the Southwest, have successively issued anti-Japanese speeches, which have naturally caused misunderstandings among the people. As a result, the anti-Japanese wave in your province, which had gradually calmed down after long-term efforts by both sides, has erupted again, and there is a trend of spreading to the entire territory of your country. For the sake of the friendly relations between our two countries, it is extremely worrying. Our country's government and people are extremely concerned. If your side continues to engage in anti-Japanese movements, there is a risk that inauspicious incidents will be provoked between the people of our two countries. This Consul General is instructed by my government to urge Your Commander-in-Chief to give deep consideration to suppressing anti-Japanese propaganda, suppressing anti-Japanese movements, and protecting the lives and property of our overseas citizens. I hope you will take effective measures. This is my sincere hope. Addressed to: Chen, Commander-in-Chief of the First Group. (June 16th)</p>

<p>Huang Renhuan's Division of the Guangdong Army Has Not Been Transferred. The Fujian Army is Actively Deploying to Suppress Bandits.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Guangdong and Guangxi armies entered Xiang territory a few days ago, western Fujian, because it is adjacent to eastern Guangdong, suddenly became tense. Those who are generally overly sensitive are easily alarmed and suspicious, and a newspaper run by a certain country in Fujian, in order to play a role in provocation, is fanning the flames and fabricating bizarre news. In fact, the border between Fujian and Guangdong is still quiet as usual. Huang Renhuan's unit of the First Independent Division of the Guangdong Army is still stationed in the Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Dabu, and Raoping areas, and has not been transferred. Wuping, Shanghang, Yongding, Pinghe, and other counties on the Fujian border also have no special defenses. According to Zhao Nan, the director of the Security Office, the provincial government has not received reports from the county magistrates of the Fujian border regarding the advance of the Guangdong army. However, after the consolidation of the pacification zones in Fujian Province, the scope of jurisdiction of the Third Pacification Zone was expanded from southern Fujian to western Fujian. Li Yannian, the commander of the zone, went to Longyan from Quanzhou the day before yesterday to inspect the new defense area in western Fujian and discuss plans to eliminate the remnants of bandits in western Fujian with division commander Lu Xingrong and brigade commander Chen Defa. It is now heard that the authorities have decided to eliminate Qiu Jinsheng in Longyan, Deng Zihui in Yongding, two gangs of red bandits in western Fujian, Zhang Kewu in Dehua, and Lu Zhenshan in Anxi, two gangs of local soldiers in southern Fujian, within the shortest possible time to avoid disrupting public order and causing future troubles for the local area. As for Lu Weisheng and Chen Yaokun, who recently claimed to be representatives of Fujian while active in Guangdong, they have no relationship with the military and political aspects of this province. The authorities have telegraphed to the counties in southwestern Fujian to maintain public order.</p>

<p>Reports the Content of the Puppet League to the Zhangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the puppet "China National Revolutionary Datong League" was uncovered in the provincial capital, Weng Cixing, the commander of the Fujian Fourth Detachment of the puppet "China National Revolutionary League Army," who was responsible for southern Fujian, also recently surrendered to the Zhangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, willing to be loyal to the party and the country. He also reported the content of the secret organization of the league, and handed over all procedures to show his repentance. After being approved for self-renewal by Pacification Director Jiang Dingwen, Weng drafted himself, one, "Dissolving the Puppet China National Revolutionary League Army Fujian Provincial Fourth Detachment Headquarters and Canceling Hengshe Yiyan," exposing its inside story and conspiracy. The following is a record of its organization and figures: Li Jishen is the chairman of the puppet China National Revolutionary Datong League, Jiang Guangnai is the chairman of the puppet Military Commission, Chen Mingshu is the chairman of the puppet Political Commission, Cai Tingkai is the chairman of the puppet Economic Commission, Chen Mingshu concurrently serves as the chairman of the Propaganda Committee, with Mei Gongbin acting as his representative. The Overseas Department is set up, concurrently headed by Cai Tingkai. Others, such as Tan Pingshan, Xu Qian, Chen Youren, Hu Qiuyuan, Wang Lixi, etc., either serve as ministers or as members, or engage in activities abroad. Others, such as Huang Qixiang, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zexiang, etc., separately form the "China National Liberation Action Committee" to preserve the small system of the Third Party. Its activities are centered on Fujian Province, establishing a puppet Revolutionary League Fujian Provincial Action Committee, with He Gonggan, Weng Zhaoyuan, and Lin Zhifu as standing committee members. For military affairs, Weng Zhaoyuan serves as the commander-in-chief of Fujian Province, and He Gonggan serves as the political representative. Xie Zaifa, Jiang Xiuqing, Zhang Xiongnan, Ye Zuyi, etc., either serve as puppet commanders or seek to serve as puppet political commissioners, distributed between northern and southern Fujian and Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, colluding with bandits, attempting to take advantage of the serious situation in North and South China, when the national situation is shaken and doubted, to ostensibly raise the banner of resisting Japan and saving the country, and secretly engage in acts of disruption and rebellion. The above-mentioned organ in northern Fujian has been uncovered and destroyed. Among the bandits in southern Fujian, only Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu, about a thousand people under Zhang Xiongnan's command, are roaming the areas of Dehua, Xianyou, and Yongtai, and Lu Zhenshan, seven or eight hundred people, attacked the Pantian mining area and fled to Ningyangbian. All are incompetent. Other small groups in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, only twenty, thirty, or dozens, although the names keep changing, are just scattered bandits. (June 26, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Zhongxiang Xiang embankment, Construction Started to Block the Breach <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>And Build Both Water Diversion and Permeable Dams and Dig an Irrigation Canal. Taking Soil and Transporting Materials are Both Difficult, and it is Difficult to be Optimistic about the Future.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the Zhongxiang Xiang River embankment collapsed, the authorities immediately planned to block the breach with all their strength to avoid expanding the flood. On the 7th of this month, Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee, Zheng Zhaojing, County Water Conservancy Department, Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Fan Xixu, Committee Member, Liu Shoupeng, Director of the Construction Department, and others, held a meeting in Wuchang and decided that the Provincial Government Economic Committee would jointly form a Remote Embankment Rehabilitation Committee, with Fan Xixu, Xi Dejiong, Shi Yuling, and Chen Ruzhen as members, and Fan was appointed as chairman. An office for the chairman and members was set up, as well as one, two, and three departments. Xi also serves as the head of the first department, managing documents, general affairs, purchasing materials, and handling transportation below Shayang. Shi also serves as the head of the second department, managing labor conscription, worker management, material requisition, and transportation above Shayang. Chen also serves as the head of the third department, managing engineering and materials. On the 9th and 10th, Fan and Qin arrived at Shagang. On the 11th, each department was formally established and began to work on blocking the breach, and another water diversion dam and permeable dam were built and an irrigation canal was excavated. The unfinished project in the fourth section is also continuing to be built. However, the predetermined plan was from the 1st to the 10th of this month for the material purchasing period, and from the 11th to the 30th for the breach blocking period. The entire embankment will be completed by July 15th. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to proceed so smoothly. There are about several important reasons: ① It is difficult to take soil. The location of the breach in the embankment is far from the Huoshan mountain, which is designated for taking soil, up to 1.5 kilometers, and double the distance back and forth. There is only one line of road in the middle. If you use too many laborers, it will be crowded, and if you use less, it will be difficult to transport more. Now tens of thousands of laborers are taking soil, and they are taking only 1,500-1,600 city squares per day. Sixteen or seventeen people can only take one square of soil. The entire breach needs more than 81,000 squares of soil. If it is calculated as more than ten people per square, more than 1 million laborers are needed. If it is calculated as taking 1,500 squares per day, it will take more than 50 days to take enough. How can the time delay resist the flood season? ② It is difficult to transport materials. The main material is Jingchai, which must be purchased along the Yangtze River and transported from Hankou. Although there is a general transportation station in Hankou, after the Xiang River is diverted by the breach, the river water is extremely dry and it is not easy for ships to travel. Land transportation is even more difficult to reach, and I am afraid that it will not be helpful in time. ③ It is difficult for laborers to live and eat. Tens of thousands of people gather in one place. There is no source of rice. Materials for building sheds, such as bamboo and reed mats, are lacking. Even the location for building sheds, low-lying areas may be flooded, and high-lying areas are too far from the work site, which is also a problem. ④ The health problems of laborers. The weather is hot now, and the laborers work in the hot sun, and they do not know how to pay attention to hygiene. At the moment, a small number of workers, more than 30% of those who are sick. In the future, the number of laborers will increase day by day, and the weather will be hotter, and epidemics will be more difficult to avoid. In addition, the personnel in charge of the material handling department, the first department, and the engineering department, the third department, who are transferred from the former engineering office, have not changed the style of procrastination and procrastination. Moreover, the trust in the laborers has been completely lost, and most of the laborers are not subject to their command, which is also an obstacle. Therefore, it is feared that the completion of the breach closure project within the scheduled 20 days will not be allowed by the facts. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Recent Situation of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Amidst the Unrest in the Southwest <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Interview with Ling Hongxun, the New Director of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: Previously, the Ministry of Railways believed that the completion of the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway was imminent, so in order to seek unified reorganization, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Reorganization Committee was reorganized, Chen Yanjiong, the director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, was reappointed as the chairman of the committee, and Yin Deyang, the director of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau, was transferred to serve as a standing committee member. The vacant position of director of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau was assigned to Ling Hongxun, the director and chief engineer of the Shaoguan Railway Engineering Bureau. Ling has arrived in Hankou from Hengzhou and took over the matter in Wuchang on the 15th. At this time, just as there was unrest in the Southwest, the railway connecting North and South, how was its recent situation? According to Ling, "I was handling the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section project in Hengzhou. Although it has been connected, the new section of the project has not been completed. I originally hoped to open to traffic within a month or two, but unexpectedly, the project has been suspended again. Nine, it is a mountain, and the work is lost. It is really a pity. The Ministry believes that Director Yin has resigned, and since the Hunan-Hubei and Zhushao sections have been connected, all transportation matters are centralized. Therefore, I have been ordered to concurrently manage the Hunan-Hubei section. Regarding the reorganization of the entire railway, the Reorganization Committee will preside over it. During this transition period, I can only try to maintain the status quo. In the future, I will return to Hengzhou to rush to complete the remaining work. As for the situation of the new Zhushao section, the Zhuzhou to Hengzhou section has been open to traffic for several months, and there are no obstacles. The Hengzhou to Qifengdu section is also勉强can be opened to traffic. However, the Chenzhou to Baishidu section is due to many months of rain, and the new road is relatively soft, and there are many collapses. Now that the project has been suspended, it is impossible to repair it for a while. When work resumes in the future, it will take at least two or three months to fully open to traffic."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Reforming the Huai Salt Transport System <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>One Hundred and Twenty Tickets Rotating Directly to Anqing; Twelve Wharf Boatmen and Various Sectors in Datong Strive</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Huai salt transported and sold along the Anhui bank has recently undergone changes by salt merchants in accordance with regulations. From the four hundred tickets of Changping Granary salt, one hundred and twenty tickets will be allocated for rotation to Anqing. This has caused panic among the people of Datong, eighty miles upstream of Wuhu. The reason is that Datong's existence as a market town is purely due to its salt wharves. Consequently, there have been numerous appeals to salt merchants to restore the original system. The representatives of the twelve wharf salt boats in Yangzhou, who made a large-scale petition, have taken concerted action. The outcome of this evolving situation depends on whether the salt merchants can retract their original proposal. The opposition from the commercial and industrial sectors in Datong and the process of reforming the rotational transport are summarized from the news gathered over the past few days and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>As a transshipment hub, it has become a commercial town due to salt and has progressed into one of the commercial ports along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province. In 1933, Miao Qiujie, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, reformed the salt system and set up a warehouse in Anqing to pilot the rotational transport system, designating the surrounding seven counties as the trial sales area. The commercial and industrial sectors in Datong believed that the seizure of the salt market was tantamount to cutting off their livelihood. After numerous appeals, several thousand laborers risked their lives to stage a petition across the river. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Anhui Bank Salt Transport Bureau to handle the matter and dispatched section chief Yu Quji and others to work with the Datong military and police organs to find a solution. The only condition was to maintain the Datong salt market, and the Huai salt would no longer be directly transported to Anqing. This resolved the initial crisis. In the past two or three years, although there has been the intention to establish a Central Salt Warehouse, Anhui Bank still considers Datong as the main hub. Unexpectedly, recently, Yangzhou salt merchants, in order to reduce transportation costs, have again proposed to use rotational transport, directly transporting the salt to Anqing for sale. Although various sectors in Datong have sent numerous letters and telegrams requesting the Anhui Bank Salt Transport Bureau and the salt merchants to restore the old system, there has been no effect. Therefore, feeling the immediate impact on their interests, the representatives of the twelve wharf salt boats first went to the residences of the salt merchants in Yangzhou to petition. The laborers in Datong then continued to appeal, and the situation escalated. It has now reached a point of no return. Looking at their warning letter to the Yangzhou Four Banks Guild and Huainan merchant Jia Songping and others, it states, "If you stubbornly refuse to see the light and willingly become the troublemakers, the laborers, in order to uphold the Ministry's orders and proposals (referring to the events of 1933) and maintain their own lives, are prepared for a sea of blood in the waters of the Yangtze River. Even if your momentum is strong, we fear it will be difficult to reach Anqing. You have money, but the laborers have their lives. We are willing to sacrifice everything." This shows their intense attitude. Furthermore, a letter from the General Guild of the eighteen gangs of twelve wharf salt transport Jiang boats states, "It has been found that transporting Huai salt to Anqing harms the livelihoods of all the workers in your gang and affects the commerce of Datong. We have already petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Anhui Bank Salt Transport Bureau, which have repeatedly issued strict orders to stop it. Now, based on previous reasons, Jia (Songping) and Zhong (Weiyu) and others intentionally overthrow the Ministry's orders, destroy the proposals, despise the workers, and willingly become troublemakers. The unemployed workers and your gang are in the same boat, and we should work together." This further shows that the workers and boatmen in Datong and the twelve wharfs, whose livelihoods depend on salt, are indeed taking concerted action. (June 17)</p>

<p>Two Lives Crushed by Shanghai-Huning Railway Car</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th, the last passenger car No. 51, which departed from Shanghai on the Shanghai-Huning Highway, suddenly had a tire failure when it passed the West Gate Station in this county, and could not proceed. A rescue car was reported to the Shanghai General Station, and a driver named Wang Dashi from Nantong drove it to repair the car. At that time, workers from the General Station, such as tea servers, cooks, and coppersmiths, were already off duty, but upon hearing the news, they boarded the car in groups to visit Jiading, a total of more than ten people. When they arrived at the Jiacun area of Luoyang Bridge Station, they encountered an eastbound passenger car and learned that car No. 51 had been repaired and departed. They immediately transferred cars to return to Shanghai. At that time, a worker in the car asked Wang Dabao to let him drive the car to practice. Due to excessive speed, he could not control the car and drove it into the field beside the road. The car overturned. After a long time, the engine still did not stop. The workers in the rescue car either jumped out or were thrown down. Wang Dabao's head was pressed into the mud, and his whole body was a bloody mess. Yu Desheng, a tea server from Liuhe, Taicang, had his waist crushed. Both of them died on the spot due to serious injuries, and the scene was tragic. Several other people were seriously injured and sent to Zhenru Southeast Hospital for treatment. Eleven people with minor injuries, including Qian Jiabin, were arrested by the police from the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Lu Fengtai, the director of the Suzhou Telegraph Bureau, previously detained Wang Rong, a fee collector, for embezzling more than 1,000 yuan. He immediately sealed up the goods of Ge Songyun, Wang Rong's guarantor, at the Xizheng New Cement Factory. The next day, Ge paid the public funds in full, and the bureau dismissed Wang Rong. Therefore, Ge believed that Director Lu had hindered his business and filed a lawsuit in court. There has already been one court hearing, and another hearing is scheduled for the 22nd. Wang Rong has also filed a lawsuit in court, accusing Lu Fengtai of restricting his freedom. The District Court held a hearing on the afternoon of the 18th and ordered him to be dismissed and await another hearing. In addition, three brothers, Cheng Chongyao and others, claimed that the land behind the Xuejiayuan Telegraph Bureau belonged to the Cheng family and has now been occupied by the bureau. They filed a lawsuit in court, accusing Lu of encroaching on property rights. The District Court is still investigating.</p>
<p>Opposing Tongyi Liquidation</p>
<p>The Suzhou Tongyi Trust Company temporarily suspended business on the 16th because it received an urgent telegram from the Shanghai head office ordering it to close. After the company suspended business, the manager, Zhu Xunyuan, disappeared. The police district in charge arrested his wife and sent her to the branch office. Because she was pregnant, she was released on bail. The creditors have separately hired lawyers Zhang Yu and Qian Zonghua to form a creditor group, declaring their opposition to the company's declaration of bankruptcy and liquidation. They have set up an office at No. 9 Lianmu Temple to proceed in accordance with the law, and will not stop until the original amount is returned. It is said that the company's Suzhou deposits are approximately 190,000 yuan. According to Zhu Xunyuan's wife, the deposits in the vault and the loans offset each other, and the creditors should not suffer losses.</p>

<p>Exempting Pig Trade Business Tax</p>
<p>The Lihengxing, Hengyifeng, Hengsheng, Ruichang, Hengda, and other pig trade businesses in Beidang have recently been assessed for pig trade business tax by the Business Tax Collection Bureau, and have been forced to pay back taxes. They specifically submitted requests to the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Finance to exempt them from payment. The Department of Finance issued a reply, stating that the business tax collected by the brokers is collected from the sellers who invest in the trade, and that those who are both brokers and operate sales with their own capital should pay business tax for sales operations. These are two separate matters, and the sections presented are clearly misunderstandings. After receiving the reply, each pig trade business stated that this tax had never been collected before, so they had not collected it from the sellers who invested in the trade over the years. Furthermore, each business does not use its own capital and only sells on behalf of customers. Before the new tax is established, it is unfair to collect old taxes first. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a request to the county government, asking it to instruct the tax bureau to approve the exemption from payment.</p>

<p>This county has always been known as an area with many bandits. Every summer, cases of arson, murder, and robbery are often heard in the villages. Since the implementation of the Baojia system in recent years, during the slack seasons, the bandits have fled to other places to hide, and the people have been able to live in peace for a while. Now that summer has arrived, all the bandits have sneaked back to their old nests, gathered their gangs, and resumed their robbery careers. In the past few days, several robberies have occurred in the third and fourth districts. If the green gauze curtains are raised, the banditry will be even more unthinkable.</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>President and Vice President Deliver Training Speeches</p>
<p>Training Begins on the 22nd</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the first flying training class of the China Flying Club was held at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Longhua Flying Port. Thirty-four students and dozens of guests, including Dai Enji, attended. President Wu Tiecheng led the ceremony and delivered a speech. After the ceremony, a photo was taken, and a flying performance was held. It is reported that the flying class is scheduled to begin training on the 22nd. The details of the ceremony are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The China Flying Club established a flying class to train primary aviation personnel. A total of forty people were accepted, and thirty-four people paid their fees and enrolled. The registration procedures have been completed. The opening ceremony was held as scheduled yesterday at Longhua Port. A colorful arch was erected at the entrance, guarded by police officers. The venue was surrounded by ropes, leading to the airfield. Two of the club's latest trainer aircraft were parked there. The venue was set up inside the hangar of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The flags of the Kuomintang and the Republic of China, the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the club's flag emblem, and photos of the aircraft naming ceremony were hung in the middle. On both sides, the CNAC's mail planes and engines were displayed, with explanations in Chinese and English for the students and guests to visit. The arrangement was extremely simple and elegant.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Thirty-four students, all dressed in yellow cloth flying suits, arrived at the venue at around 9:00 AM. They were all very energetic and lively. The attendees also included club committee members Wang Xiaolai, Yao Xijiu, Li Dachao, Zeng Yijing, Li Ruyan, Wu Yunzhu, Dai Enji, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Lin, the director of the Postal Bureau, Cai Jinjun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and female aviator Li Xiaqing, who recently returned from studying in Europe. President Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and arrived at the venue at around 9:30 AM. The students lined up in front of the aircraft for roll call. President Wu personally inspected them. Then, the Save the Nation aircraft, piloted by instructor Yang Guozhu, flew to the venue. The ceremony then began.</p>
<p>President's Speech</p>
<p>President Wu Tiecheng presided over the opening ceremony, led the attendees in paying respects, and delivered a training speech, saying: "Distinguished guests, students, the opening of the China Flying Club's training class today marks the beginning of the first page in the history of civil aviation in our country. Sun Yat-sen's last words stated that the fundamental methods for building a prosperous and strong country are to make full use of talent, land, resources, and smooth flow of goods. Our country is vast, rich in resources, and has a large population, but it cannot achieve prosperity and strength because resources cannot be fully utilized and goods cannot flow smoothly. The biggest reason for this is the lack of complete transportation, which prevents the country from being truly unified, the nation from being truly united, and resources from being fully developed. For example, Guangdong Province does not produce rice, and its food supply comes from Vietnam and Siam, with an annual outflow of 70 million yuan. The neighboring province of Hunan produces abundant rice, but due to transportation difficulties, it accumulates inland and cannot be transported out to meet the needs of other provinces. The same is true for Shanghai. The lack of supply and demand is caused by the separation of transportation and cannot be mediated. This is the most important economic problem in our country that needs to be solved urgently. The government has been working hard on construction in recent years, and its main task is to build the transportation industry. Its decisions, such as economic defense, are also in progress. In recent years, the gradual completion of the national highway network, the construction of inland railways, and the opening of air routes have all achieved good results. Convenient transportation shortens leisure time and lengthens time, allowing Chinese people to travel around the country as if they were in one room. We should pay more attention to valuable time. In one's life, the time of youth is only twenty or thirty years. How should we make full use of it to develop human abilities, benefit society and the country, and work hard for personal career? The China Aviation Association is a public group that assists the government in building aviation. The Flying Club is also a public organization, and it is still an innovation in the country. Its purpose is to cultivate civil aviation talents to develop civil aviation and reserve pilots for the country to act as reserves for the air force. All of you students have come from afar to enroll and receive training, and you should also share this aspiration. I hope you will keep in mind the purpose of serving the country. The Eurasian and China National Aviation Corporation here has factories and machines for you to study, which is a rare opportunity. I hope you will study hard. The hope of our country in the future lies in the enlightened, intelligent, and capable youth. I hope all of you will strive to do your best."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Vice President Wang Xiaolai then delivered a speech, saying, "We are carrying out the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's last words and realizing the cause of aviation to save the country. Therefore, the China Flying Club was established and the flying class was opened. This is not only to assist the government in building air defense, but also to develop civil aviation. Its significance has been explained in detail by President Wu. The flying class is now the first class and has the nature of a pilot and model. Its performance will have a great impact on later generations. I hope all of you students will be tireless and study hard to achieve the goal of being a model for the country and later generations. I have been engaged in the aviation industry and have the ambition to have my ten children study aviation. Due to their age, they have not been able to enroll yet, but I will definitely achieve this goal in the future. Flying training, although it is just starting in our country, has already been advocated in books, such as 'If you don't fly, you're done, but if you fly, you'll soar into the sky' and 'A meteoric rise,' which all encourage flying. There are also two flying generals in history, such as Zhang Fei of the Three Kingdoms and Yue Fei, who were loyal to the Han Dynasty and wholeheartedly served the country. The greatness of their spirit is enough to be a model for all of you. I hope that after you graduate, you will work hard for the country." After the speech, music was played and the ceremony concluded. A group photo was taken at the venue to commemorate the occasion. Instructors Chen Zhiguang, Chen Shenhu, and Yang Guozhu then piloted three aircraft, carrying the guests on a circular flight around the venue. The event ended at around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Class</p>
<p>The training class is scheduled to begin training at Longhua Port at dawn on the 22nd. It will be divided into two classes, morning and afternoon, with instructors Chen Buzhou, Yang Guozhu, Chen Zhiguang, Chen Shenhu, and others serving as flying instructors. The academic subjects will be taught by Li Ruyan, Chen Buzhou, and others. The classrooms will be set up in the club on Albert Road. It is reported that some students have come to Shanghai from Hanzhong, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places specifically to enroll. They have all moved into the club to stay. After the club was expanded, several dormitories have been opened, but the students are responsible for their own meals. The club attaches great importance to the discipline of the students. Therefore, there are fixed times for getting up, resting, and attending classes. They get up at 5:30 AM every morning and gather at the airfield at 6:00 AM. Lights must be turned off at 10:00 PM in the evening. As for extracurricular activities, they have been guided to organize a sports club to build their physique and a reception room has been set up for proper social interactions. The reading room is equipped with various daily newspapers and various musical instruments for entertainment. It is also learned that Ms. Chen Suren wants to join the first training class and has asked the club to accommodate her. The club has approved her request and will allow her to complete the procedures for training after she passes the physical examination. The registration for the second class of students will begin soon.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Chamber of Commerce Smuggling Problem Research Conference Drafts Proposal Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen trade associations in the city, including the silk and satin industry and the chemical raw materials industry, held a joint meeting some days ago to discuss the rejection of smuggled goods. It was decided to first select Luo Qinghua and eleven others to form a smuggling problem research conference. On the one hand, the committee will draft a plan and ask the members' congress of the chamber of commerce to select representatives from various industries to organize the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Smuggling Inspection Committee to lead various industries to assist the government in investigating and suppressing smuggled goods. The committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, and more than ten committee members attended. It was decided that the various industries should provide rules on smuggling inspection for research. A proposal to the congress was drafted, which reads as follows: "Regarding the proposal, since the occurrence of smuggling in North China, the import of smuggled goods that evade taxes has been increasing day by day. The impact of this is not only the destruction of the national tax system and the loss of tax revenue, but also the fact that our dying industry and commerce will suffer a major blow and will not be able to survive. The government authorities have clearly stipulated laws and strictly investigated and suppressed smuggling in order to prevent smuggling and protect legitimate commerce. They have also stipulated the collection and registration of transit cargo sales certificates and the issuance of registered cargo sales certificates. The Chamber of Commerce and trade associations are responsible for handling the matter. The government is determined to thoroughly prevent smuggling and improve the organization of trade associations. Our Chamber of Commerce and trade associations are all legitimate business groups. We should respond to this major event that affects our own interests and exercise the powers granted to us by the government to defend ourselves. We should also ensure that legitimate commercial goods are not affected by this. Shanghai is a transportation hub for the north and south, and the commercial situation is complex. Today, smuggling is rampant, and cunning people are deceiving in every way. Precautions should be even stricter. It is difficult to achieve thorough rejection of smuggling unless each trade association improves its own organization, advises its members to reject smuggled goods, strictly implements inspections, and acts with conscience to supervise each other. In order to consolidate the front line and maintain a unified pace in the handling of smuggling affairs among the various industries, so as to fully exert the power of rejection of smuggling, it is necessary for the Chamber of Commerce to organize a special committee led by three business leaders to exercise the responsibility of supervision and guidance. With this organization, we can maintain connections between the upper and lower levels and among the various industries. Even if there are obstacles, they can be easily resolved. This is a necessary measure to strictly implement smuggling suppression. Therefore, our association and others have held a joint meeting and decided that the congress should pass the resolution and hand it over to the executive committee to select representatives from various industries to organize the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Smuggling Inspection Committee, formulate regulations, lead the various trade associations, assist the government in investigating and suppressing smuggled goods, so as to maintain the national treasury and ensure the safety of industry and commerce. We have recorded the proposal and respectfully await your decision. Proponents: Luo Qinghua, Xu Limin, Lou Fengzhao of the Silk and Satin Association; Xie Zhongfu of the Chemical Raw Materials Association; Ke Ganchen of the Cotton Cloth Association; Shen Tianxin of the Knitting Association; Zheng Zenan of the Sugar Association; Ge Weian of the Seafood and Grocery Association; Jin Runxiang of the Paper Association; Ma Jisheng of the Cosmetics Association; Cai Shengbai of the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory; Ba Lingyun of the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association; Liu Zhiyuan of the Salt Association; Chen Zixiang of the North-South Goods Exchange Association; Le Fucheng of the Candy, Biscuit, and Canned Food Association; Ling Zhijia and Zhu Binglu of the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Association; Zhao Xianji of the Hardware Association; and Xi Runeng of the Western Dye Association."</p>

<p>Total Amount of 3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government is raising 3 million yuan from the Farmers Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank to establish agricultural warehouses. It has been decided to establish five large warehouses in counties with more agricultural products. Medium-sized warehouses will be established in each county, totaling 75. In addition, small warehouses will be established in various towns and townships. The New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China and the Shanghai head office of the Shanghai Bank that they both agreed in principle to the Zhejiang Provincial Government's loan for the establishment of warehouses. Wu Tingyang, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, has contacted the Hangzhou branch of the Farmers Bank of China and others. After negotiations are completed, they will be submitted to the head office for approval and a contract will be signed. It is reported that these warehouses will be used to manage grain reserves and store agricultural products. It is planned that the large, medium, and small warehouses in each county will be completed before the autumn harvest this year.</p>

<p>Summer Festival Approaching; Industry and Commerce Busy Collecting Debts</p>
<p>June 13th is the Summer Festival for industry and commerce. Banks and money shops are closed for one day according to the regulations of the trade association. With the Summer Festival approaching, industry and commerce have been busy sending out lists and dispatching personnel to collect customer debts. The funds collected are all submitted to banks and money shops, so the collection and submission of each bank and shop is also busy. The external office hours of banks remain the same, while the external office hours of money shops have been extended, depending on the business of each shop. The mid-year financial statement period for banks is approaching. The savings departments of each bank will pay interest on deposits on the 20th, and the commercial departments will pay interest on deposits on the 25th. The savings and commercial departments of each bank have been preparing for the payment of interest in recent days and are scheduled to close for two days on July 1st and 2nd to prepare for the mid-year financial statement. The Shanghai Banking Association has scheduled a general meeting of members at 4:00 PM on the 27th at its offices on Hong Kong Road to report on the association's affairs for the first half of the year and to approve the budget and financial statement.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo British Gold Bonds Oversubscribed <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Allocated proportionally based on the amount subscribed</p>
<p>Subscriptions of £50 or less will not be reduced</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway 6% British Gold Bonds, amounting to £1.1 million, were issued on the 16th of this month, underwritten by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC. Applications closed on the 17th. This reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the underwriting banks yesterday that the bonds were met with enthusiastic subscriptions since their announcement, being fully sold and oversubscribed. It has now been decided to allocate them proportionally, with subscriptions of £50 or less not being reduced. All subscriptions will be accepted at 94, and the underwriting banks will notify subscribers and issue provisional certificates. The bonds, in denominations of £50 and £100, will be exchanged later upon printing. Therefore, when allocating proportionally, calculations will be made in units of £50 or £100, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Public Concession Factory Inspection Agreement <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>A Factory Inspection Bureau will be established with an equal number of Chinese and foreign staff</p>
<p>Inspectors will be selected for a three-year term</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Pao reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) will study the draft agreement regarding factory inspection in the Public Concession, negotiated between the SMC and the Chinese authorities, at its meeting next Wednesday. Negotiations on this matter have been ongoing for over five years, and the SMC is only now considering it for the first time. The document was delivered to Fessenden, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, by Yu Hongjun yesterday. According to Fessenden's statement to the Ta Lu Pao reporter, he believes the SMC will approve the final draft of the agreement. He and Secretary-General Yu have exchanged opinions repeatedly, believing that the agreement is the only possible route to a compromise satisfactory to both parties. Although the entire contents of the agreement are not yet known, it is rumored that the SMC will not be granted the right to implement Chinese factory laws in factories owned by foreigners enjoying extraterritoriality. The principle agreed upon by both parties is to advise foreign-owned factories. If this approach is ineffective, the SMC will use its licensing authority to crack down on factories that deliberately violate the provisions of the factory inspection agreement. However, even with the agreement in place, the SMC does not intend to implement all of Chinese factory laws, only the part concerning factory inspection. This will be the first phase of the national government's broad program to improve industrial conditions across the country. According to current plans, the agreement will take effect at the beginning of next month. Since the industrial section of the SMC already has a basic framework for factory inspection, the implementation of the new agreement is not expected to require a long period of preparation. A factory inspection bureau will soon be established in the Public Concession, with an equal number of Chinese and foreign staff. These inspectors must be familiar with the structure of Chinese factory laws and will initially be on probation for six months. They must also possess knowledge of industrial chemistry, construction, mechanical science, and engineering. The agreement will be valid for three years, after which each party may decide to extend it, amend it, or completely abolish it. The current agreement will serve as a basis for future discussions with the French Concession authorities on a similar agreement.</p>

<p>Dispatching Chen Lingyi as a representative to Beijing on the 21st</p>
<p>To compete for seats in the National Assembly, various women's groups in the city held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon. Representatives from organizations such as the China Women's Athletic Association, the Tongmenghui, the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the China Women's Temperance Union, the Shanghai Women's Association, and the China Women's Society, including Liu Pingji, Wang Ruizhu, Xie Zuyi, Liu Wang Liming, Ling Jixi, Jin Guangmei, Bu Zhenhua, and Chen Zhujun, numbering over ten people, were present. Chen Lingyi chaired the discussion, and it was decided to establish the Shanghai Women's National Assembly Representative Election Committee. A board of directors will be formed, consisting of one representative from each women's group. Chen Lingyi was elected as the chair, and Xie Zuyi and Bu Zhenhua as vice-chairs. It was decided to send Chen Lingyi to Beijing to petition. The petition was drafted by Chen Lingyi and Ling Jixi. According to Chen Lingyi's statement to the Xin Sheng News Agency, she was assigned to go to Beijing to participate in the national women's National Assembly election and decided to take the 7:55 AM train to Beijing on the 21st. The purpose of the petition can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>As the National Assembly represents all citizens, women, being citizens, should equally enjoy the rights and obligations of male citizens.</p>
<p>In accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on equality between men and women, women should be given opportunities to participate in politics.</p>
<p>The central government should explicitly stipulate quotas for men and women in professional and local organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Banks Raise Deposit Interest Rates <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Seeking to Attract Deposits and Develop Business</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, banks are striving to attract deposits in order to develop their business. Since the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications established special savings departments and the Central Trust Bureau was established, commercial banks have been raising interest rates to prevent deposits from fleeing. For example, the annual fixed deposit rate has been raised from 7% to 8%, as is the case in Shanghai. The interest rates for fixed deposits in installments have also been changed accordingly. The following is a comparative table of interest rates for fixed deposits in installments at various banks (note that the Central Trust Bureau and the Bank of China are the same).</p>
<h3 id="e112">Solar Eclipse This Afternoon, Faint Eclipse Visible in the City <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there will be a solar eclipse today. If the weather is clear and cloudless, a faint eclipse will be visible here between 1:04 PM and 3:20 PM. The next solar eclipse will not be visible again for five years, i.e., September 17, 1941.</p>
<p>According to a French translation from the Shanghai Daily, the Xu Jiahui Observatory reports that June 19th is the date of the solar eclipse. The situation at that time will be as follows: the shadow of the moon will not exceed 140 kilometers in width. This shadow will first appear in the Mediterranean, then pass through Greece, the Black Sea, and reach the Caucasus, before moving on to Soviet Russia and northern Manchuria, and disappearing at 180 degrees longitude in the Pacific Ocean. The start of the solar eclipse will be at 10:45 AM, counting for places like Soviet Russia's Qian Sike and Boli, as well as Japan's Xiaoching and Murane. The duration of the total eclipse will be between one minute and one minute and thirty-two seconds, and the area where the total eclipse is visible will be in Bayika. Only a part of the solar eclipse will be visible, and only one-third of the sun will be obscured by the shadow of the moon. From this perspective, the people of Shanghai will pass through the solar eclipse unknowingly. As for the precise time when the solar eclipse is visible in Shanghai, the eclipse will begin at 1:04 PM and end at 3:20 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Temporary Cholera Prevention Office Requests Cooperation from the Medical Community <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office requests continued cooperation from the medical community for cholera prevention and treatment</p>
<p>The chairman and members of the Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office deeply appreciate the efforts of medical colleagues in Shanghai in assisting with cholera prevention and control in the past few years. Cholera is a summer disease in our country. In Shanghai, although it sometimes appears as early as April or as late as October, it mostly occurs in July, August, and September, and is a cyclical epidemic, occurring about once every two or three years. For example, in Shanghai in 1929, there were 3,555 cases; in 1932, there were 4,296 cases; in 1930, there were only 127 cases; in 1931, there were 482 cases; and in 1934 and 1935, it was almost non-existent. Due to the efforts of all parties, the mortality rate of cholera in Shanghai has greatly decreased, from 30-50% to 7%. In terms of the total number, the mortality rate of poor patients who quickly seek medical attention in public hospitals seems to be lower than that of those who delay. Whether cholera will recur this summer is uncertain, but the central and municipal health authorities have made adequate preparations. In this matter, the assistance of opening clinic doctors and other sectors is extremely necessary. Through the years of efforts by the central and municipal health authorities, such as implementing cholera prevention, holding public lectures, distributing manuals and leaflets, posting slogans and illustrations, and contacting hospitals to admit patients, the public has gained a deep understanding of cholera. Furthermore, because patients are admitted to free hospitals early and receive the good results of intravenous saline infusions, even the ignorant and uninformed are happy to seek medical attention. All isolation hospitals and plague hospitals in the city have a total of over 1,000 beds, providing free accommodation for cholera patients, but this may not be widely known. During the summer, private practice doctors commonly see gastrointestinal inflammations similar to cholera, some of which may be atypical cholera. Therefore, to assist health authorities, please pay attention to the following items:</p>
<p>Free stool tests: All suspected cholera stools must be tested using appropriate methods. If private individuals do not have this equipment, they can send them to the Municipal Testing Institute for free diagnosis.</p>
<p>Sending to plague hospitals: Suspected or confirmed cholera patients should be immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Cholera patients must be hospitalized for treatment for two reasons: (A) to prevent the spread of infection, and (B) hospitals are well-equipped and can provide comprehensive care and appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Provide prevention methods: Try to make patients understand the importance of the following: (A) Carefully preserve food, fruits, and other items to avoid contamination by dirty utensils and flies; (B) Use tap water for drinking, cooking, and washing; (C) Receive cholera vaccination in the summer. Health authorities in various cities in Shanghai conduct universal vaccination every summer, and many have benefited. When vaccinating people, private practice doctors are asked to use vaccines made from local cholera bacteria. These vaccines can be purchased from local health laboratories or the Nanjing Central Epidemic Prevention Office at a very low cost. Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office, June 15, 1936.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Federation of Citizens' Associations sent a letter to the Party and National Flag Production and Sales Bureau stating: It has been reported by the 46th District Branch of our Association that the Party and National Flag is a symbol of the Party and the nation, and is of utmost importance to the dignity of the nation and the awareness of the people. After the government invited bids and established the Party and National Flag Production and Sales Bureau, it was entrusted with exclusive authority to improve manufacturing and unify distribution. It has been found that the products of the Party and National Flag Production and Sales Bureau are indeed slightly more advanced in manufacturing technology than those sold by merchants in the past. However, the prices are high, which deters people from purchasing. It is believed that the Party and National Flag, being the embodiment of the spirit of the Party and the nation, should be widely promoted so that everyone can purchase it, thereby promoting national consciousness and enhancing patriotic thought. However, the current high pricing is similar to unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods and pursuing excessive profits. If this is not corrected promptly, it will not only affect promotion but also deviate from the government's intention in establishing a special bureau to emphasize the importance of the Party and National Flag. Therefore, we are writing to request your association to forward this to the Party and government organs, ordering the merchant to reduce prices and lower profits to achieve the grand effect of universal promotion, which would be in the public interest. Accordingly, we are writing to request your bureau to lower prices as much as possible within a reasonable range to facilitate promotion, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>Since his arrival, Wu, the Director of the Shanghai Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been determined to rectify matters. Recently, he noted that some shipping companies pay attention to the fire safety equipment on ships, while others neglect it. This is not in line with the purpose of planning navigation safety. Therefore, he has issued an order to all shipping merchants to instruct the captains of their ships to comply with this order in the future and not to neglect it. To demonstrate his seriousness, Wu personally inspected the Changli Shangwu and Second Section Chief Huang Xuyu and Technical Director He Dao of the bureau on the morning of the 17th. They boarded the Haiheng steamship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to inspect the ship's lifeboats, lifesaving, and fire drill work.

He finished the inspection at 11:00 AM and then visited the various facilities of the ship and its management methods.

<h3 id="e124">Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Opposing the Reduction of Rickshaws <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating that the gradual reduction of rickshaws in the concession, with transportation tools completely replaced by cars and trams, is a proposal that, apart from directly and indirectly benefiting the companies themselves, only a very small number of citizens with superior living conditions may agree with. It completely disregards the livelihood of the tens of thousands of laborers within the concession. The position of your council is different, as it is entrusted by more than one million Chinese and foreign citizens within the concession to handle public affairs. All municipal facilities should not only seek convenience for a small number of people but should be designed with the greatest number of citizens in mind. Especially, the livelihood of the laborers should not be ignored. If the proposal to gradually reduce rickshaws within the concession is implemented, it may win the praise of a few in terms of urban appearance, but the increase in the number of unemployed people will be a cause for concern in terms of public security. A wise politician should not only pursue superficial grandeur but should also pay attention to such practical issues. Therefore, we are writing to request that your council give serious consideration to the proposal to reduce rickshaws and not approve it lightly. This is what we earnestly hope for.</p>

The Bureau has ordered its Opium Smoker Registration Section and Investigation Unit to dispatch personnel to various branch bureaus, stations, and teams to investigate and report. Furthermore, the Bureau's second phase license renewal period was originally set for three months, but since renewals began in April, this month marks the expiration date.

<p>Nineteen Packets of Morphine Seized Under the Stairs, Song Sanjie and Chen Songshi Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>French Concession police detective Wang Ronggui and detective Zhu Juju recently learned that a blind person was selling the drug morphine powder at 92 Lee May Road for people to smoke. They went to the address the other day and arrested the landlady, Song Sanjie, 23, and Chen Songshi, 42.

<h3 id="e133">Shen Aizhen Sues Lin Xingyuan for Divorce, Citing Gonorrhea as the Reason <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Medical Examination Confirms Gonorrhea, Lin Claims Chronic Condition is Treatable</p>
<p>Lin Xingyuan, a local physician residing on Longhua Road in South Shanghai, has recently been sued for divorce by his wife, Shen Aizhen (formerly Lin Shenshi), who claims that he is suffering from a terrible illness, has no interest in life, and is infertile. The lawsuit states that she married the defendant, Lin Xingyuan, through a matchmaker in March of 1930. The marriage was initially harmonious, but soon the defendant's behavior changed, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, contracting gonorrhea, which has persisted for several years. Because it is an incurable disease, the plaintiff believes it indirectly affects childbearing. Thus, after seven years of marriage, they have not had children, and there is no joy to be found in family or life. Furthermore, the defendant is violent by nature and often resorts to physical abuse when displeased. He also disregards the family finances, forcing the plaintiff to borrow from her family to make ends meet. The suffering she has endured over the years is beyond description. Continuing in this manner will sever her lifelong happiness. Therefore, she is forced to request a divorce. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Sun held a court session. Lin Shenshi did not appear and was represented by her lawyer, Pan Renxi, who reiterated the plaintiff's claims. The defendant, Lin Xingyuan, denied any abuse, claimed that he gave all his earnings to his wife, denied having gonorrhea, and opposed the divorce. The magistrate ordered the court clerk to take Lin to the forensic doctor for an examination to determine if he had any disease. Upon resuming the session, the magistrate told Lin Xingyuan that the medical examiner had diagnosed him with gonorrhea. Lin replied that he had chronic gonorrhea, but it could be cured. He requested that the court order them to remain together. At this point, the magistrate ordered the commencement of arguments. After the lawyers for both sides presented their cases, the magistrate declared the debate closed and set a date for pronouncement of the judgment.</p>

<p>Not a Sudden Illness, but Swallowing Opium, Letter States Revenge for Parents</p>
<p>Zhu Jingfang, a sixteen-year-old apprentice coppersmith from Nanjing working at the Gongping Copper and Iron Factory on Shilu Road in the South City, committed suicide. At 8:20 PM the other night, after night watch duty at the factory, he went upstairs to bed. Around midnight, Wang Chunfang, a clerk in the factory's rice room, heard Jingfang suddenly vomiting and moaning. Suspecting a sudden illness, but seeing his face pale, he immediately informed the owner, Zhu Shouju, who hired a car to take him to Shanghai Hospital. It was discovered that he had swallowed opium to commit suicide. Due to the severity of the poisoning, medical treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly thereafter. The medical center was notified, and it was found that the deceased had left four pairs of suicide notes addressed to the Futai Pawnshop on Yanjia Lane in Suzhou, to be delivered to his older brother, Zhu Yifang. Enclosed were letters to his older sister and younger brother, which read, in part, "To my dear brother Yifang, now we are forever separated. My death is inevitable. Of the four of us, I rely entirely on you to fight for our parents' revenge. Please do not grieve."

<h3 id="e137">Mobilization for National Products Movement; Propaganda Week and Lantern Parade Postponed <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The National Products Exhibition of Shanghai's lantern parade and fire extinguishing performance have been postponed to the 22nd. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lantern Parade Postponed: Preparations for the conference's lantern parade have been underway for many days. Because the participating manufacturers, in addition to the 150-plus manufacturers from the National Exhibition, have been joined by outsiders, totaling approximately 200 manufacturers, those who joined late have been unable to finish making their lanterns in time. Many have requested that the conference postpone the event. Furthermore, the elaborate dragon and tiger lantern of the Sino-French Pharmacy, the golden chicken lantern of the Taikang Food Company, and the exquisite lanterns of other major factories are all intricate and difficult to complete on time. The conference has decided to hold the event on the evening of the 22nd of this month. The gathering point will be the Penglai Market, and the route will circle around the southern part of the city along Mingguo Road. An announcement of the postponement has been issued.</p>
<p>Representatives' Meeting: Given that the National Products Year National Products Movement Conference has stipulated that the period from the 20th should be the National Products Movement mobilization propaganda week, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce believed that the propaganda work was too rushed and would not be effective unless it was postponed. Therefore, a meeting of representatives from all manufacturers was convened yesterday. The following resolutions were passed: 1. The National Products mobilization propaganda week will be postponed to begin on the 22nd. 2. During the propaganda week, artists from the city will be invited to perform arts at the meeting. 3. A free performance ticket will be given for every five jiao spent in the sales department, in order to attract more customers and increase interest. 4. The lantern parade and the demonstration of fire extinguishing equipment by the Puball Industrial Company will be postponed to the 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Song Ziang, Just Granted Probation for Embezzlement, Commits Fraud and Breach of Trust <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Li Yufu, Manager of Yitai Exchange, Sues</p>
<p>A Total of 13,000 Yuan Paid to the Defendant</p>
<p>Defendant Absent from Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Song Ziang, a key employee in the accounting department of the China General Omnibus Company, recently embezzled over ten thousand copper coins from the company, which he was unable to repay. He surrendered himself to the police and was handed over to the First Special District Court, which sentenced him to seven months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Now, Li Yufu, the manager of the Yitai Exchange on Broadway, through his lawyer, Lu Qi, has filed a lawsuit in the District Court accusing Song Ziang of fraud and breach of trust. The lawsuit states that the defendant, as an agent in the accounting department of the China General Omnibus Company, invited the plaintiff, Yitai Exchange, to enter into a contract to sell copper coins on December 12, 1931, depositing a guarantee deposit. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff would sell all the copper coins from the company's ticket sales every day, for a term of one year, with the provision that the contract would continue in effect after the expiration date until June 30 of this year. Initially, both parties complied with the contract, delivering the copper coins and paying the money on the same day. For several years, the relationship was harmonious. However, recently the defendant, using the pretext that the company was facing economic difficulties and the market was sluggish, expressed concern that it would be difficult to collect money after the copper coins were issued, and that there would be negligence. Therefore, if the plaintiff wished to purchase a certain amount of copper coins, they would have to pay the price in advance. For the sake of business, the plaintiff had no choice but to comply. Therefore, whenever the plaintiff decided to purchase coins, they had to pay the company's accounting department in advance and receive a stamped receipt, waiting for the company to send the copper coins on the same day or a few days later. The plaintiff had become accustomed to this and had no doubts. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, the plaintiff paid the company's accounting department 3,000 yuan in legal tender with the Exchange's 12th issue No. 2839, and received a receipt. The defendant then fraudulently told the plaintiff's representative that the Central Mint was urgently requesting the delivery of copper coins due to the conversion of subsidiary coins, and that if the Exchange did not pay in advance, there would be insufficient supply in the future and it would be difficult to purchase coins. The defendant strongly urged the plaintiff to pay more in advance to secure the purchase, so as to avoid being unable to purchase coins in the future. On the 5th, the defendant took another 5,000 yuan from the plaintiff's immediate demand draft from the Bank of Communications and a ten-day bill of exchange from the plaintiff's letter of credit Exchange in the name of the company for 5,000 yuan, totaling 13,000 yuan in legal tender. Apart from receiving copper coins worth 5,000 yuan, the defendant consistently delayed sending the copper coins despite repeated requests. On the 8th, the defendant suddenly disappeared. The plaintiff, unable to do anything else, published a notice declaring the draft and bill of exchange invalid, and reported the matter to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and the Nanjing Road Police Station. The newspaper reported that the defendant had secretly sold over ten thousand copper coins from the company and surrendered himself to the police headquarters. The plaintiff then understood the full story. The defendant, using the name of the company's accounting department, took a large amount of drafts and bills of exchange from the plaintiff and Xuan Da Exchange, converting them into his own assets and transferring them to cover other debts, causing the plaintiff to be deceived and suffer a loss of 8,000 yuan. This is not permissible under the law and principles of justice. Furthermore, the plaintiff's payment was not made to the defendant personally, but to the company's accounting department, as evidenced by the company's receipt. It was the defendant's duty to use this money to purchase and send the copper coins, but instead, he illegally converted it into his own assets and transferred it to cover his personal debts, causing the plaintiff to have the already declared invalid drafts and bills of exchange presented by others, resulting in a loss of credit and potential litigation over the realization of the drafts. Therefore, the plaintiff requests legal action and seeks the return of the drafts and bills of exchange. Yesterday, Magistrate Zhao Yongzhou held a court session. Neither party was present. After the plaintiff's lawyer, Lu, made his statement, the defendant's lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, appeared in court and stated that the case was purely a commercial transaction, amounting at most to a civil debt dispute. The defendant was unable to attend court because of matters in Suzhou and requested a postponement, promising to attend the hearing. The magistrate ordered the court to postpone the hearing.</p>

<p>Under the Pretext of Hiring Workers for the Golf Course</p>
<p>Thirteen Victims, Including He Leming, High Age, First Offense, Police Lawyer Hopes for Lenient Sentence</p>
<p>Yu Jintao (also known as Fusheng), a local man from this county, is sixty-two years old. He used to be in the business of jade and antiques, but recently became unemployed and destitute. He came up with an idea and, starting from the 12th of this month, went to the Xian Shi Amusement Park every evening, claiming that the Hongqiao Golf Course was planning to hire an additional fifty workers and staff because it was the summer vacation. He claimed to have a close relationship with the manager of the golf course, Fan Huichun, and that if anyone wanted to apply for a position, he could guarantee success. At that time, thirteen people, including He Leming, Zhang Dazhang, Cao Zhen, Zhang Baoyu, Zhang Shiding, Wang Acai, Gu Laisai, Zhou Amao, Shi Changfu, Xie Yushan, Xie Juqing, Wang Zhiying, and Xu Ronghai, all asked Yu to introduce them. Yu then demanded a corresponding reward. Except for He Leming and Zhang Dazhang, who each paid ten yuan, the rest each paid five yuan and six jiao. Starting on the 16th, Yu disappeared from the Xian Shi Amusement Park. The victims then realized that they had been deceived and searched everywhere for Yu's whereabouts. Finally, at 8:50 AM yesterday, they found Yu at the Sihai Inn, Room 2, on Tianjin Road. He Leming reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered Chinese detective Lang Jintang and detective Lu Rongting to arrest Yu and bring him to the police station. Fake round chop books and other items were seized. When questioned about the whereabouts of the money he had swindled, Yu claimed that he had swindled money from another person in the Chinese Concession in West Shanghai, and after being discovered, he negotiated with the victim. He then invited the victim to a tea house at No. 12 Jiaozhou Road, Roberts Road in West Shanghai, and returned the money. Unexpectedly, several gangsters sitting at the next table overheard the matter and extorted all of his 138 yuan. Therefore, he claimed that he had no money left. He confessed that the whole thing was a scam and that the Hongqiao Golf Course had no intention of hiring anyone. The detectives then joined forces with the police detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest the three gangsters, Zhang Yifu and Hou, and the women Xu Lushi and Tang Chenshi, who had extorted Yu's money. They were temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, the police station handed Yu Jintao over to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the above situation and charged Yu with habitual fraud under Article 340 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that the defendant was old and had no prior convictions, and therefore hoped that the court would take these two points into consideration when sentencing. Cao Zhen and Xie Juqing then testified about their experiences of being scammed. When questioned, Yu Jintao admitted that he had resorted to this scam due to poverty and asked for leniency. After Magistrate Feng Shide reviewed the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and postponed the sentencing.</p>

Cai demanded 280 wen, while Wang offered 200 wen. Cai then shouted from inside the stall. Wang slightly raised his offer, but Wang refused due to financial reasons. Cai then used foul language and started a fight. Unexpectedly, someone suddenly stabbed Wang in the back several times, causing blood to gush out. The culprit escaped from the crowd. Wang fell to the ground in extreme pain. Officer Zhang Tongzhang arrived and took Cai Linsheng and the injured man to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation.

<p>Lai Jiansheng, a 26-year-old Cantonese student in his fourth year at Datong University, met Liu Quanxian, a 17-year-old female student at Daxia University, at a dance hall last year. Both students were intellectuals, and they fell in love at first sight, embarking on a romantic relationship. Unexpectedly, due to their close affection, Liu became pregnant. As her abdomen grew larger, it became difficult to conceal, especially in the hot weather. Liu's mother, Madam Liu Xu, noticed this, questioned her daughter, and found Lai's photos and other items. After Liu confessed everything, she entrusted a student at Zhizhi College to write a letter to Lai, hoping for a resolution. At that time, if Lai had remained consistent, they might have become a couple. However, Lai avoided meeting them. Madam Liu and her daughter were angered by Lai's ungratefulness and resorted to the actions of rogue children, hiring a lawyer to sue in the District Court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Li opened the court session. Because Lai had never appeared in court, the plaintiff requested an arrest warrant for Lai, stating that he was about to graduate. The judge approved the request for a strict summons.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>Defendant Released on 1,000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Pan Xianting, a 68-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 22 Yonghua Lane, Fangbanqiao Milu Road, in the French Concession, was reported to the French Concession Police by Chen Zhongqing (34-year-old Wuxi native) Gu Bingsheng (29-year-old Yangzhou native) Wang Guangyi Xu Wanrong (39-year-old Yangzhou natives) and others, residing at No. 2 Jiuan Lane, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. They claimed that in February of the 24th year of the Republic, Pan claimed to be the general manager of the Jiande Iron Mine and, through the introduction of Yu Wenbin and Gu Zhongliang, entered into contracts to transport pig iron and serve as a foreman to recruit workers. They were defrauded of security deposits (including 867 yuan in security deposit under Chen Zhongqing's name, over 500 yuan for food supply, 190 yuan in security deposit under Gu Bingsheng's name, 680 yuan under Wang Guangyi's name, and 220 yuan under Xu Wanrong's name). After a long time, there was no news of actual operations, and Pan disappeared. Now they have finally found his whereabouts and requested the police to arrest and investigate. The policeman approved the request and sent Detective Li Deshu to arrest Pan and take him into custody. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Qiu Huan Ying interrogated him. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the Police Department stated the case, briefly saying that the defendant was arrested for fraud. The Police Department still needs to investigate and requested a seven-day extension to investigate and then file a lawsuit for interrogation. Subsequently, the plaintiffs recounted the circumstances of the fraud one by one. When questioned, Pan Xianting denied the fraud and hired a lawyer to defend him. Because the defendant was old and sick, he requested bail. After verifying the confession, the court ordered a rescheduling for the 24th for further interrogation. The defendant was granted bail of 1,000 yuan with a guarantor who would ensure his appearance upon summons. Without a guarantor, he would be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Dance and an Instant Connection: Dancer Wishes to Grow Old with Dance Partner <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>To Gain Trust, Tong Rongsong Promised to Give the Woman 10,000 Yuan, Bank Employee Discovered a 1 Yuan Passbook Altered to 2,000. The Woman Accused the Man of Indecency and Forgery</p>
<p>Tu Xiaoying, a girl from Ningbo, is currently 18 years old and was raised by the Zhu family. Therefore, when Xiaoying worked as a dancer at the Victory Dance Hall on Beijing Road last year, she used the name Zhu Meizhen to accompany dances. Meizhen was young and beautiful, with a graceful figure and skilled dancing, so she was favored by many dance partners. In January of last year, Tong Rongsong, a Jiangdu native residing at No. 9 Jinle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, only 19 years old, went to the Victory Dance Hall to dance with several friends. Having long heard of Meizhen's reputation, he danced with Meizhen once and felt an instant connection. Afterwards, every time Tong Rongsong went to the Victory, he would have Meizhen sit at the table and accompany him, and his love deepened day by day, eventually leading to a relationship. They would secretly meet at inns. They even discussed spending their lives together. Therefore, Tong not only gave 3,000 yuan as a fee for Meizhen to sever ties with the Zhu family but also promised to give 10,000 yuan to gain her trust, first paying 2,000 yuan into a passbook at the China Industrial Bank, with the remaining 8,000 yuan to be paid later. Unexpectedly, when Meizhen took the passbook to the China Industrial Bank to withdraw money, the bank teller discovered that the passbook had been altered from one yuan to two thousand yuan and confiscated the passbook, contacting Tong Rongsong, but to no avail. Meizhen, believing that Tong's actions violated Article 227 of the Criminal Law regarding indecency and Article 201 of the same law regarding forgery, had her uncle, Tu Jianren, and her mother, Tu Chen, hire lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a lawsuit against Tong in the court, requesting punishment according to the above two articles and also attaching a civil lawsuit requesting damages and consolation money of 10,000 yuan each. Furthermore, because the defendant had a new love and was to marry another woman on the 17th of this month, they requested a swift arrest and investigation. This case has already been heard once, but because the defendant did not arrive, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan Xinzhen continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant, Tong Rongsong, arrived with his defense lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Yuan Xilian. Tu Xiaoying (i.e., Zhu Meizhen) recounted the previous events, stating that in May, she had committed adultery with the defendant at the Yangzi Hotel, and the defendant promised to give her 10,000 yuan, first paying 2,000 yuan, etc. When she took the passbook to the China Industrial Bank to withdraw money, she discovered that it had been forged from one yuan to two thousand yuan, etc. When questioned, the defendant Tong Rongsong confessed that he had met Zhu Meizhen at the Victory Dance Hall in January of last year. After meeting, he would go to dance and ask her to sit at the table. At 2 AM on the night of May 6th, Zhu Meizhen finished dancing and returned home, and he accompanied her. Because the door was not opened, Zhu suggested that she would like to have a long night conversation with him, so they opened a room at the Oriental Hotel. That night, they did have a relationship, but there was no discussion of marriage. The passbook containing 300 yuan was given to Zhu as a gift in January of last year. In May of this year, he suddenly received a call saying that a Miss Tu wanted him to go. He went to Tu's house and was surrounded by seven or eight people who forced him to issue a 2,000 yuan IOU. At that time, someone produced a passbook and forced him to change the amount to 2,000 yuan. Then they drove him out, etc. Judge Tan verified the confession and ordered the case to be rescheduled for the afternoon of the 27th for further interrogation. The defendant was ordered to provide a guarantor for 5,000 yuan. Before the guarantee was submitted, he was allowed to be bailed out under the responsibility of his defense lawyer.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th of last month, at around 7 AM, the kidnapping of five-year-old Dai Haiyi occurred at the home of Dai Keheng, a sand and gravel businessman at No. 20 Huaiyuan Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. For over a month, there has been no news. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered the Xinzha Branch to solve the case. After Detective Squad Leader Bao Ziying of Xinzha spent money to investigate, he learned that the hostage was hidden in Wuxi. The day before, he took his squad members to Wuxi by car and stayed overnight. On the afternoon of the 17th, he joined forces with Zhong Jihe, the leader of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, Deputy Detectives Wang Bingsheng and Dai Shouquan, and several detectives to intercept a bandit boat outside Yinglong Bridge in Ximen, arresting bandits Chen Yi, a boatman, and Chen Youfang, two brothers. They then went to the thatched sheds in Qishuyan Wuguidun and other places, where they captured another bandit, Sun Xiaolong. They immediately interrogated him and learned that the hostage was hidden in Changzhou. At around 4 AM, Squad Leader Bao and others took a speedboat to their destination and discovered a small boat. They immediately arrested bandits Xia Shiwei, Guo Ruyang, and Xu Dapeng, three people. They further confessed that the remaining gang members were in Xiaoxi Nei, Dingshu Town. They immediately rushed there and saw a small boat moored in a small river. Inside the cabin, they found the hostage Dai Haiyi and five other boys, as well as a male and female bandit guarding the hostage. They were all taken to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau for detention overnight and were sent to Shanghai this morning.</p>

However, Hu Lifu left behind ancestral farmland and properties in the Huafeng Village area of Shanghai, and farmland and property in the Shanghai and Qingpu counties totaling over one hundred acres, along with houses at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Columbia Road, worth over 100,000 yuan (bank savings not included). All of these assets were concealed and occupied by his son, Hu Wenbing (also known as Yongcheng), who refused to hand them over. Last winter, his sisters Jiang Hu Hongfen and others hired lawyers Shen Qichang and Xu Yannian to file a lawsuit against Hu Wenbing in the District Court to divide the estate. After repeated court hearings, the court ordered both parties to reconcile outside of court, but the defendant had no sincerity, resulting in a failure to reconcile. Yesterday at 11 AM, Judge Han Zuoti continued the tenth hearing, with the plaintiff and defendant and their lawyers appearing in court to present their views. Judge Han earnestly advised the defendant, but the defendant refused, so he ordered the witnesses to be summoned and the hearing to be continued.</p>

More can be added if needed in the future. All branch offices, licensing offices, and vehicle inspection offices have small bottles of Shachuen water available for free access. Furthermore, the association has decided to investigate whether a hospital should be added to meet the needs of member rickshaw pullers without having to send sick rickshaw pullers to existing hospitals.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Sausage Casing Industry in Shanghai (Continued) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(Twenty-eighth in the series "An Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce")</p>
<p>Current Status of the Sausage Casing Industry in Shanghai: The sausage casing industry in Shanghai is divided into three categories: (1) fresh sausage casing shops, which are small in scale and have relatively stable business; (2) sausage casing factories, which are subject to frequent changes, with the existing ones being supported by foreign merchants; (3) export companies, which are dominated by foreign merchants. The current status of each is described below:</p>
<p>Fresh Sausage Casings: The fresh sausage casing shops in Shanghai have an industry association, located in Nanlin Lane, Zhabei. There are twenty-odd members in the association, with capital ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, with the highest being no more than 9,000 yuan. Each morning, the shops receive anywhere from a little as thirty or forty pig sets to as many as one hundred pig sets. The number of pigs slaughtered daily in Shanghai is limited, so the operations of fresh sausage casing shops are actually quite small. A list of the fresh sausage casing shops is as follows:</p>
<p>Sausage Casing Factories: There are more than ten sausage casing factories in Shanghai, divided into Chinese and foreign-owned. However, the Chinese-owned sausage casing factories are all related to foreign merchants. It is recently reported that 45% of all sausage casing factories are directly or indirectly operated by German merchants. The business of sausage casing factories is mainly wholesale, which involves greater risks. Factories that have closed down due to losses include Ma Liangji, Yu Songji, Yongli, Shunfeng, Yuxing, Zhiyuan, Pan Defu, Fengmao, Yuanyuan Guo Shunji, Xin Da, and others. The names of the existing factories are listed below:</p>
<p>(Note) This factory will soon relocate to Zhabei</p>
<p>Export Companies: The sausage casing export companies in this city are all operated by foreign merchants, from Germany, France, England, and the United States. The turnover is as high as 400,000 yuan. The Chinese-owned export companies are Hanli and Yingfeng, which are substantial and creditworthy, and foreign businesses are happy to trade with them. In addition to having a factory in this city, Hanli Company also has a sausage casing factory in Dinghai. Due to the need to advance funds, the capital turnover of each company is quite complicated, but they are now all able to make a profit. The list of export companies is as follows:</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th) The Ministry of Education previously ordered all public and private colleges and universities to investigate the number of unemployed graduates from the 22nd and 23rd academic years in order to determine specific relief plans. It is reported that a total of 108 schools nationwide, approximately 80 of which have reported to the ministry, have reported their numbers.

<p>The private Dongfang Junior High School on Tianbao Lane, Hai Lu, in this city, has been in turmoil since last year. The principals have been frequently replaced, the school is empty and desolate like a ruined temple, and there is no financial solution. The students are of complex backgrounds, and their thoughts and actions are often excessive. After repeated investigations by the Municipal Education Bureau, it was deemed that the school's foundations were shaky, its facilities were inadequate, and there was no hope for improvement. Fearing that it would mislead young people, the school has been ordered to close.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Small Number of Students at Waseda University in Japan Reject Supervisor Chen <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>One or Two Students Incite the Majority, Who Remain Unmoved</p>
<p>The Disturbance Subsides After School Warning (Tokyo Dispatch) Chen Cipu, our country's supervisor of students studying in Japan, returned to China on the 4th of last month to report on his work, following an order from the Ministry of Education. Shortly after Chen's return to China, a small number of students at Waseda University suddenly launched a campaign to reject Chen. Regarding this matter, the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo on May 15th and the Shanghai Times on the same day both carried detailed reports from the Dentsu News Agency. The situation at that time was quite tense, but since then, there has been no significant development. After extensive inquiries by reporters, it was learned that the matter has been settled. The course of events and the truth are briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since Chen Cipu was dispatched to Japan last August, he has adopted strict supervisory methods to rectify the affairs of students studying in Japan, which inevitably dissatisfied one or two students. After Chen returned to China on the 4th of last month, a student named Li from Waseda University proposed rejecting Chen at a meeting of the Chinese Students Association of the school. There were originally hundreds of Chinese students at the school, but only fifty or sixty people attended the meeting that day. Li's reasons for proposing the rejection of Chen were that Chen was "bureaucratic" and used "high-handed tactics," which were quite empty. Although many of those present did not agree, they did not openly oppose it. As a result of the discussion, Li and Weng were temporarily elected as executive committee members to contact student groups in other schools, but the students in other schools were unmoved. After learning of this matter, the Waseda University authorities warned Li not to create trouble, summoned Li and others for a talk, and strictly ordered them to focus on their studies and not to cause disturbances again, otherwise they would be expelled to maintain school discipline. Since Li and others did not receive support from students in other schools and were subjected to this warning, they stopped their activities, and the disturbance subsided invisibly. Reporters further learned that Li, who proposed rejecting Chen, and Weng, who was elected as an executive committee member, had both been reprimanded by Chen for certain incidents and harbored resentment in their hearts. This attack on Chen was purely a means of venting personal anger as a form of revenge.</p>

<h3 id="e182">An Evaluation of Yang Xiu's Achievements <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Huaiqing</p>
<p>Yang Xiu has stirred up a heat wave in our country's women's swimming world, and it is only natural that the people love and support her. However, the evil society uses distorted poses to achieve certain goals and fulfill certain wishes, which is hardly a blessing for the sports world.</p>
<p>Now Ms. Yang will represent China at the World Games. Her domestic achievements in this declining era should be considered quite satisfactory. But what hope does Ms. Yang have of participating in the World Games with her achievements? If we compare her achievements with the women's swimming achievements of previous World Games, we can know that Ms. Yang's hope, like that of other athletes, is generally hopeless, and the most hopeless.</p>
<p>The heat of society's love for Ms. Yang can be said to have reached above the boiling point. How will the young Ms. Yang use her eyes to distinguish the people unfolding before her, and how will she use her rationality to cope with the evil and distorted society, especially as a school-age girl, a female athlete with a promising future? She must not be misled, and her athletic skills are likely to stop there.</p>
<p>At the National Games in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines, Ms. Yang's victories are indeed worthy of enthusiastic praise from society. However, the fact that Japanese women did not participate in the 10th Far Eastern Games was also a major reason for Ms. Yang to enjoy such extraordinary honor. Although we do not fully understand the level of Japanese women's swimming, to sum it up in one sentence, Ms. Yang's achievements are still far behind them, and even further behind the world swimming level. We should actively encourage Ms. Yang and kindly urge Ms. Yang to reach a truly bright state, and to shed a ray of dawn on the Chinese women's sports world.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange changed drastically again. Rumors arose, and large bulls came out one after another. No. 4, 11, 33, and 66, etc., were sold off one by one. The situation was deteriorating, and there was a danger of seeing new low prices again. There are not many days left in this month's period. Most of the shorts have spot goods. The bulls repeatedly used smoke screens, and rumors arose again, so they came out one after another. The environmental situation is still not easy to cheer up. The process yesterday was initially due to the rumors in Dingzhong, and the Guizhou army and the central government still failed to cooperate. The bulls slowly came out, opening slightly 0.2 or 0.3 jiao to 0.7 jiao. The second session slightly compensated for the shorts, and the market situation was slightly chaotic, with highs and lows seen mutually, without firm seals. In the afternoon, the rumors became more intense, and the bulls came out, becoming more crowded. Type D continued to fall by 1 yuan and 1.5 jiao. The market sentiment was very discouraged. The selling pressure on the market was extremely strong. Large players came out, scrambling to be the first. The closing situation still had no firm image. Each bond fell by another 0.3 or 0.4 jiao.

<p>Recent Months are Not as Popular as Distant Months Because the Old Bulls Came Out</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the daily increase was still strong. In fact, the situation of overseas yarn and cotton is gradually improving, shocking the market. At the same time, the current yarn customer sales are still able to be maintained. The thread price is especially popular, leading the yarn market to rise. However, because some aspects of the recent yarn have already taken profits and came out one after another during the price increase, the pressure is still heavy, and the increase is gentle.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: Feng Tuo Entered</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened high in each month in the previous market. The bulls were activated because the world yarn and cotton rose unanimously. Gengfeng continued to come in a large amount, and the amount was very huge. The bulls added more, and Yu Da also compensated for the short position. However, the old players, Dafu, Dachang, Chengxin, and Chengyi, all spit out and settled together. The market was enthusiastic. As a result, each month of standard yarn rose by 1.2, 4, 5, and 7 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened and each had a small rebound of 0.3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao. After the second session, it gradually turned upwards. The market reported that government bonds were falling, and the news was favorable, so the buyers were active. Yu Da bought in large quantities, and the table was dry. However, the bulls still came out. By the time the market closed, it was mediocre.

<p>—The Middle Month Has Exited the Five Yuan Mark—</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firmer because American cotton and Indian cotton have risen across the board. Prices are higher for adopting the price, which has aroused bull activity. Chen Cotton's momentum is getting stronger and stronger, but the multi-million-dollar amount in the financial world has been issued at the time of the price increase. According to a survey, there are still 80,000 to 90,000 dans of flock cotton. It is difficult to sell all of this cotton for a while.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Rises by Six or Seven Jiao in the Near Term</p>
<p>In the previous market, the standard cotton market opened, and each month showed a soaring phenomenon. Everything has stepped up as American cotton has stepped up, and Indian cotton has also stepped up to follow, and the situation is beautiful. Dafeng and Changfeng compensated for the short selling in large quantities, but Dafu and Juxing then increased together and sold out. Among them, the bulls settled, and the shorts also added more. As a result, each month rose from 5 jiao to 6.5 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the new cotton rose from 3 jiao to 3.5 jiao. In the afternoon, the market opened and each month fell by 1 or 2 jiao. After the second session, rumors spread in the market, so the buying interest was strong, and the market gradually rose.

<p>Indian Cotton Surges by Two and Seventy-Five Robies</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened because of good news in Liverpool and tight spot goods. Each month rose from unchanged to 2 pounds. Then, the same industry short account made up for the July period in large quantities, causing the market price to rise to 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 9 li and a half, and the cotton hoarding place sold about 80,000 bales. According to the German Cotton Office, the cotton hoarding in July has been reduced to 90,000 bales. Spot merchants bought July and sold October. The same industry and new speculative accounts bought new cotton. The weather report was smooth, but people paid attention. There has been no new development regarding the continued sale of cotton on loan. Before closing, the market situation turned quiet, and there was a slight bull settlement. Finally, the spot demand was active. There were not many sellers, and it was still firm and expensive. The spot price rose by 13 pounds, and the futures price rose by 9 to 14 pounds. The British cotton spot price rose by 6 points, and the futures price rose by 8 points. In the Indian cotton early morning, the bulls settled in July.

<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was booming due to the sharp rise in standard yarn and cotton, and the rising wind of current yarn and thread was also very strong. The actual sales of both plain and colored cotton cloth were excellent, and there were huge transactions in military heavy coarse cloth, and the situation was getting more and more favorable. The inventory of piece goods has been thin. The selling market for white goods is the firmest for Dong goods and fine cloth. Yesterday, each piece rose by 1 jiao. Fine cloth from this factory was mediocre, occasionally rising by 2.5 to 5 fen per piece. Fine twill from this factory has been tired for a long time because the sales were not smooth. It has gradually rebounded under the stimulus of yarn and cotton in recent days. The lower gear has risen by 2.5 fen, and the middle gear has risen by 5 fen. Although the cargo loading of the Cantonese gang has been slightly restored, the replenishment of goods is very dull due to the tight financial relationship. The Yunnan gang is more active, but the market situation in Yunnan is also very bad because it is the season for farming. There is no profit to be made from loading each cargo, and it is more difficult to approach the Shanghai price. The Anhui gang is still continuing to handle more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and plain crepe de chine, and the use of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi is still not lonely, but most of them are hoarding goods. After the Tianjin gang handled serge the day before yesterday, they continued to enter more than 30 boxes of tribute satin and more than 100 pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth yesterday. The cheap summer price in the main street market is still quite lively. The Jiangyin factories have already opened up for autumn goods in the colored plush, and the eight or nine-month futures are available for 5 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao per piece, and the wholesale shop in this street has a healthier appetite.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Summer Goods and Woolen Fabrics Sell Better <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics and flannels only had transactions for summer season goods yesterday. The atmosphere in the Charity Association market was stable. The market atmosphere for domestic yarn-woven products and machine-woven fabrics was particularly popular. The customer gangs on this street had a great need, such as washed crepe de chine, washed flannel, washed woolen cloth, washed drill, khaki and white adhesive cloth, and white double-strand single machine cloth. Sales are unusually smooth, and there are many transactions every day. The price of each color of local machine-woven flannel was 3.5 jiao per yard yesterday, the first grade of white cloth was 3.3 jiao, the second grade was 2.7 jiao, the price of Middle drill cloth was 3.2 jiao, and the price of washed woolen fabric was 3.6 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw generally stable prices for all months in the morning session. While foreign wheat quotations saw slight declines of eight fen to one or two jiao, the unfavorable environment and the inability of new domestic wheat prices to become cheaper caused opening prices for all months to be consistently firm, up by two or three fen compared to the previous day. The afternoon session saw brisk trading, with prices initially weakening before firming up again. The reason for this is due to numerous rumors in the current situation, difficulty in widely distributing new arrivals, and people's long-held expectations. Currently, the wheat market is supported by good demand from factories, and arrivals have not yet been widely distributed. Prices for superior wheat have risen by three to four fen, such as Guan Dian wheat at four yuan and four jiao, Yangzhou wheat at four yuan and three jiao, Chuzhou wheat at four yuan, three jiao and eight fen, Shaoxing wheat at four yuan, three jiao and one fen, Danyang wheat at four yuan, two jiao and seven or eight fen, Shaoxing wheat at four yuan and three jiao, Wuhu wheat at four yuan, two jiao and seven fen, Suzhou wheat at four yuan, two jiao and seven fen, secondary quality at two jiao, Weiting wheat at four yuan, two jiao, Penglai wheat at three yuan and nine jiao and a half, Taicang wheat at three yuan and seven jiao and a half, and Bian Feng wheat at four yuan and five fen. Fuxin sold 1,700 bags, Fufeng sold 1,400 bags, and Shenda sold 700 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, continuing arrivals of rice from the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang added to the supply. There were more arrivals from the Yangtze River. Although rice prices generally failed to rise steadily, the market was active, and people mostly expected improvement. Yesterday, sales of Fuzhou rice were slightly sluggish, but there were inquiries for Xiamen and Quanzhou rice. Local demand was also active, and Tianjin merchants purchased 550 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of Jiangbei machine-milled rice. As a result, prices for all grades of rice, both high and low, rose by several fen to over a jiao. Small polished rice also rose by one jiao. Yesterday, total city transactions included 550 bags of small polished rice, 2,170 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,394 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 180 bags of Taizhou rice. The overall market trend was firm.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Seafood: New Ningbo Kelp Production Poor <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>New Ningbo kelp has seen increasingly active arrivals from various mountains in recent days. Over the past two days, a total of 657 bags, weighing over 800 dan, have been transported. However, most of the arrivals are overly oily. According to fishermen, the excessive rainfall this year made drying extremely difficult. One rainfall could easily lead to oiliness. As a result, high-quality, clean white kelp is particularly scarce. Merchants are reluctant to buy because of the poor quality. Fortunately, new arrivals were allocated according to the numbers to begin with. However, prices have already softened from twenty-three yuan to twenty-one yuan and five jiao, a sharp drop of three yuan compared to the previous session. Because the new kelp production is of low and inferior quality, various merchant guilds continue to purchase aged stocks. Street inventories are gradually decreasing, and dealers are unwilling to sell quickly. Currently, the market price for high-grade kelp is thirty yuan, with common kelp at twenty-eight yuan. The market is firm, and there is no sign of softening for the time being. Aged northern kelp stocks have long been depleted, and new arrivals are scarce. Current sales prices are fifty yuan to forty-eight yuan for Yantai kelp and forty-five yuan for Jiangbei kelp. The market is also firm and brisk.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat, with little fluctuation. The Merchants’ Association’s listed prices for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot at twenty-two yuan and one jiao, and re-export at six yuan and eight jiao and a half, but no transactions occurred.

According to Chaoqing's Shantou reports, production prices are fixed. However, exchange rates are gradually narrowing, standing at over one thousand two hundred and forty yuan yesterday, inevitably increasing costs. If sales improve, trading houses may tighten prices again. Yesterday, 1,892 bags of Hainan brown sugar arrived via the Qingyuan ship, and trading houses quoted firm prices.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Homecoming <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>—Yao Mu</p>
<p>It has been almost ten years since I returned to the city of × where I grew up. The kind old relatives I cherished in my childhood, the old family estate and garden where I once lived for many years, the community lanterns in the Lantern Festival, the welcoming gods parade that shook the entire city—especially the naive minds—even though they brought a bit of melancholy, they occasionally flashed in my memory, but only flashed. A person forever wandering in the world is not easily touched by the homesickness.</p>
<p>Several days before Qingming, my old father, who has added new white hairs, especially called me before him and solemnly said:</p>
<p>"The ancestral graves have not been swept and worshiped for several years. Your ancestors are truly disheartened. They haven't even had a bite of cold pork."</p>
<p>"Um"—seeing that I didn't respond to him much, he indignantly continued, "In the future, I will never trouble you when I die. Water burial would be cleaner! I raised four sons..." He then routinely complained and vented his usual grievances about his sons to me.</p>
<p>I also routinely listened from beginning to end, without a word of change, until he poured out the small ivory tiles from the box and began to play his ivory tile divination, then I answered lightly:</p>
<p>"Let's go this Saturday, to avoid the crowds during Qingming." Having been confined at home for half a year, I was really tired and just wanted to change places. Returning to my hometown was naturally not a matter of objection.</p>
<p>In these few years, even the village ferry has changed glaringly. Although the hull is still a flat-bottomed building ship with red and green patterns in the style of the Middle Ages, the dark and narrow cabin is always crowded with people, steaming with a unique fishy smell, but at least the "dining hall" has inserted some modern devices in a nondescript way: in front of the flower niche enshrining the sea god, there are no rows of canvas horses, but two rows of "roast pig plate" style bunk beds with soft mattresses; the kerosene lamp has been replaced by a bright electric light, the leisurely tea bowl has been replaced by a practical thermos bottle, and even the natural toilet has been replaced by a flush toilet—the main symbol of modern civilization.</p>
<p>However, the chaos and noise before the ship still dominate: the ferryman is holding a flickering lantern and shouting loudly to attract passengers, the porters are carrying luggage, and under the fiery sky dyed by the neon lights on both sides, this corner of the world constitutes a very lively oil painting. In the ferry, vendors are shouting and interweaving, passengers are fighting for berths, and a loud and turbid local accent that sounds like a quarrel is a bit unfamiliar. The drum has struck, and the ship is about to leave. The chaotic heat wave subsided a little. On the rattan chairs in front of the dining room, several diners were chatting leisurely:</p>
<p>"Old He, you've gained a lot of weight. No wonder Old Jin said you've stored more than one acre of grain this year," a middle-aged man with a badge said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Don't listen to his nonsense!" The answer came from a country gentleman-like person, "He's the one who got rich."</p>
<p>"Didn't the grain price rise from three yuan to more than six yuan in these two months?" another person interjected.</p>
<p>"But I bought three thousand bags when it was five yuan. Who dares to do more business with legal tender? The profit is limited. Who is like Old Jin, whose warehouse is packed full?" Old He's face revealed a look of annoyance.</p>
<p>"In this depressed year, you old folks should be content. I heard that the fan and grocery stores are all crying bitterly!"</p>
<p>The old man didn't answer, got up and walked outside, the corners of his flattened mouth hung with a smug smile, and his bald head with a few sparse hairs floating with brilliance.</p>
<p>After the boat guard casually checked the luggage, the ship really set sail. The fiery red light and the noisy voices gradually faded away, leaving only the gurgling of water and the occasional whistle that sent the tired passengers to sleep one after another.</p>
<p>After changing to a long-distance bus, I arrived at the city of ×, which was exactly the time of the morning market. A huge swarm of flies was beginning to manage their day's life. On the road, on the backs of pedestrians, and on the faces of children, these small black animals were gathered. The fish stalls on the roadside, the salted fish hanging in front of people's eaves, and the rice shops' rice baskets were all densely covered with black spots, like black sesame seeds. With every step, the fly formation in front of me buzzed and scattered, flying up and pouncing on my face, drilling into my ears and nostrils. Being in this kingdom of flies, I realized that this was my true hometown.</p>
<p>The newly built roads lay idle, with only a few rickshaws, miscellaneous old stalls, and food stalls being the actual users of the roads. The stone-paved streets and alleys were still occupied by sugarcane residue, dog feces, human feces, and sewage. There are indeed many Western-style buildings rebuilt from old houses, but all the old-fashioned things like "dwarf legs" are preserved. Some houses still have the long-backed bamboo chairs that the grandmothers sat on. The community altars piled with stones on the streets and alleys are still full of strips of paper with the names of adopted sons and daughters, but the ancestral halls are even more desolate than before: the flagpole is broken, the flagpole stone has collapsed, and the sides of the gate are overgrown. We have no ancestral hall, no ancestral house, and even the closest relatives are scattered, so we had to settle down in a step-aunt's house. Some distant cousins were already there waiting for us.</p>
<p>"Uncle, blessings, cousins are really capable..."</p>
<p>"If grandma were alive, I don't know how happy she would be!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, it looks good outside!" My father answered coldly, not knowing if he was a little proud or touched a sore spot. I said "ashamed" to myself.</p>
<p>The old women stroked my eldest child, asking about his height and weight, and said to me with a smile, "You were just as big as this when your grandfather had his birthday!"</p>
<p>Yes, also at the age of this child, I often came here with my mother. At that time, my grandfather, uncle, and cousins were still alive, and it was the heyday of my uncle's family. The three-section house had just been newly built, and in the courtyard full of wisteria in front of the hall, there was a large goldfish tank with artificial mountains, which was the most attractive thing to me. Then came marrying cousins, marrying cousins, and visiting relatives was like running water, very lively. But since my grandfather died, my uncle's family began to decline! In a few years, more than half of the family members died, the house was haunted by ghosts during the day, and later sold two-thirds of it. Even the eldest cousin, who was more than fifty years old, had to make a final struggle and return to South America. Now the step-aunt lives only on the bookstore side, the goldfish tank has long been gone, and even the uncle's beloved orchids have all died.</p>
<p>"How is old He of Hejiatang?" My father was talking to a distant great-uncle who had followed him in the past, reminiscing about the old family situation in × city.</p>
<p>"No need to mention them. Taibaofu and Dongyuanzhuang have all fallen apart. Hejiatang, alas, people call it Little Macau. The children either blow or gamble. It is said that there are eighty or ninety guns!"</p>
<p>"Opium pipes, right?" "I don't know, no defeat is strange!" "The old man hides in the countryside, eating steamed food, eating up the family property, how can that last long!" My father once again expressed his old claim that heroes should start a career outside.</p>
<p>Before the offerings were prepared, I took the time to visit Li Ma, who had served me since childhood. The low wall made of snail shells was a bit crooked, and as soon as I entered the gatehouse, I saw that the pine tree in the courtyard was still as green and lush as before, but in a few years, Li Ma was a bit old. The jade hairpin that still held her hair bun had a lot of white hair, and her toothless mouth was even more crooked.</p>
<p>"Aming!" She opened her mouth and called my nickname, "When did you come back?" Seeing my child beside me, she pulled him to her side and asked, "This is your old man, right? How many younger siblings do you have? Alas, how cute! He looks just like you when you were little. Fourth brother, I didn't expect Li Ma to have the life to see your child."</p>
<p>"Call her grandma," I said to the child. "My darling," she said, while reaching into her clothes, and after a long time, she took out two copper coins and stuffed them into the child's hand, "A little something, buy something to eat."</p>
<p>"Are you doing well? Are you still sewing palm fans?" I saw that her house was still piled with some scattered palm fans and a water tank soaked with rattan threads.</p>
<p>"Isn't it still the same!" She sighed slightly, "Sewing palm fans is not always available, my eyes are almost failing, I can only sew ten a day, earning two cents each."</p>
<p>I looked at her carefully, and her eyes were indeed a little dim. The scene of her and my grandmother sewing fans quickly under the glass lamp in front of the gods at dusk suddenly appeared before me.</p>
<p>After she asked a little about my family situation, I bid her farewell.</p>
<p>"I don't even have a cup of tea to give you, this house is too dirty," she said politely to us, "Are you living at your aunt's house? I'll come see you later."</p>
<p>"We're just about to ask you to help us divide the pork among the relatives!"</p>
<p>Out of the suburbs, the grave mountains were already visible in a row. I don't know how many times I've followed my father and brothers to the graves, but I always can't recognize the way. In the past, the roadside was densely piled with green sunflower fields, some of which were abandoned, and some were drooping with withered yellow leaves. However, the azaleas on the tops of the mountains and beside the pits were always as red as blood. The mountain road was very flat, but walking in the dry and hot sunlight like early summer was a bit tiring. The children, sweating all over their heads, still jumped and bounced along, while my father leisurely took healthy steps, talking and laughing with his great-uncle, and sometimes stopped to point out whose grave mountain it was.</p>
<p>The roast pig was barely prepared, but it was still simple: at least the exaggerated tomb couplets like "Good Fortune in the Resting Place of the Ox" and "Fine City Standing Tall" were not prepared. My father respectfully worshiped at a grave and always lingered for a while. The stereotyped geomancy theory flowed out of the mouth of my father, who was confident in his knowledge of surveying.</p>
<p>"This is the toad spitting fire," my father said, pointing and painting as if reciting his proud article, "Look, the back is resting on the Five Old Peaks, and the front is facing Guifeng as a case, and the case means a pen holder. In the past, it would at least send out a county magistrate!"</p>
<p>"The water in front is a little bit leaked, it doesn't gather wealth," the great-uncle also pretended to be an expert and criticized.</p>
<p>"But, distant water is good, it doesn't matter," my father quickly defended. "In the past, my great-uncle turned against his in-laws for the sake of fighting for this mountain, and even now some people want to intrude."</p>
<p>Then they talked about the geography of the surrounding graves and the family history of the gentry of × city. Which mountain sent out a few licentiates, and which mountain sent out tens of thousands of family property, they talked with great interest.</p>
<p>The children were either picking wildflowers by the graves or staring at the sugarcane on the walls, shouting that they were thirsty.</p>
<p>I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I would jump up happily when I heard that I was going to sweep the graves. When I visited the graves of my uncle's family, I often followed, because I wanted to pick azaleas in the mountains, dig up branches of water, and beat the iron statues of Qin Hui and his wife with sugarcane tails in front of the Yue Fei Temple in Beijiao (the custom of Chongyang). The big meal in front of the grave was even more likely to arouse my greed. When the adults were sipping and tasting, I also ate sugarcane and gnawed on pork bones, especially the flavor of roasted goose liver, which still makes people nostalgic. Now, the tomb sweeping that looks like a formality, this kind of joy can only be found in memory!</p>
<p>When entering the city, the sun was scattering dew, and our return route happened to pass through Hengchong, where I was born, and the old things of my childhood suddenly welled up in my heart. The snow-white stone road and stone bridge under the moonlight, the fire and the continuous figures of people and lights in the water when the bride passed by, everything seemed poetic.</p>
<p>"Your father was born here," my father said to his child with a smile, pointing at the Situ Ancestral Hall.</p>
<p>"Huh! This broken house!" With the child's words, I could no longer deny the desolate scene here.</p>
<p>The narrow Situ Ancestral Hall was tightly closed, the walls were covered with moss, the small ditch in front had dried up and was piled with garbage, and the small stone bridge crossing the ditch was also broken. The ancestral halls on both sides were quiet, a bit like the scene after a war. The beautiful picture revolving in dreams and ideals is ultimately different from the reality before my eyes!</p>

<p>—He Ruirao</p>
<p>At the end of the autumn sky, a thin horse rides through the desolate wilderness in the cold evening light. The withered bushes cover countless barren graves; in the barren graves, lie buried thousands of eternally unawakened dreams. On the short stump slanting into a pile of earthen hills, there still remains a vague inscription: ——The upper officer Zhang Deqiang is buried here. In the west wind, the desolate smoke is vast, where can one find the memories of billowing smoke? Does the setting sun also understand human affairs? Silently writing out the infinite sadness of all ages! The rider disappeared in the vast twilight; yet from the hazy distance, came a mournful neigh of a horse!</p>

<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>With the last train of the twelve-thirty shift gone, this small train station built in the mountains and fields returned to silence. In the sky, a round full moon faintly hung, illuminating the wide countryside until it appeared bright white, suddenly looking like a world coated in mercury.</p>
<p>At this time, flagman Wang Da was yawning as he stepped out of his shack and headed towards the small path made of pebbles that led to the village. He was a young, quiet, and honest farmer. Two years ago, after his aunt's husband, Rong Qian, who lived in the big city, became the deputy stationmaster of Baishui Station, he was introduced to this remote place to work as a flagman. At that time, he was still a loner, very content with his job. Eating, working, sleeping... all followed the routines of a docile person, and his days passed as peacefully as a stream. But soon, someone threw a boulder into his peaceful stream, causing it to ripple and become unsettled. That was when he met a young widow named Ma in the village. This young widow was short, only twenty-five or twenty-six years old, with a pair of small star-like eyes and a serene and sincere smile. Although she often wore mended and tattered clothes, they were always clean. Her loud voice, her sincere smile, and her polite manner often had a great allure to young farmers, but the villagers were somewhat afraid of her and disdained to pay her any attention.</p>
<p>When the stationmaster held his thirty-fifth birthday celebration at his newly built mansion in the village, Wang Da became aware of her beauty, which shocked him. He realized for the first time that he was captivated by a woman. After the last train of the twelve-thirty shift left, he often walked back and forth outside her window, softly whistling love songs in the local dialect. She opened her window and echoed him in a dreamy voice, and he boldly climbed in through the window. That's how they fell in love.</p>
<p>Wang Da knew a lot about her. She had no family, no land, just a widow who had lost her husband, a mother who had lost her daughter, a lonely village woman who had been insulted and harmed. She had a boisterous and almost mad personality, a common trait among frustrated young women in this remote area, drinking and casually sleeping with any farmer she liked. Sometimes she would get drunk in the fields and run along the ridges, singing lewd songs, while young farmers chased after her with willow branches, singing along in coarse voices. Sometimes she would be pinned to the ground, her clothes torn off, her hair disheveled, forced to dance by several men playing the sanxian. She was treated as a toy to be casually entertained, she was humiliated and harmed; yet, she got her work and necessary food from it.</p>
<p>Wang Da hated her wild and unrestrained lifestyle; however, he couldn't live without her. His life was lonely and barren, and he was deeply infatuated with her beauty. "I must try to advise her, I should say to her like this: Masha, this kind of life is terrible, you have the good qualities of a respectable woman, you must strive to be a respected and welcomed woman!..." Thinking of this, he smiled. He believed that just a word from him would have a profound effect. However, he was immediately overshadowed by another thought and felt cold. He saw her drunken, shameless laughter, he saw her lewd dancing, he remembered the lyrics from her filthy mouth, he remembered the mournful sound of the sanxian and the foolish faces of the musicians, burning with excitement. He was furious. "This is such a terrible, terrible life!..."</p>
<p>By this time, he had stepped through the first gate of the village. In the distance, the stationmaster's family lived in a Western-style house, the only civilized building in this remote place. The large glass windows still reflected a strong ray of light. The village had become even more silent and desolate. He walked slowly, unconsciously stopping for a while in front of the stationmaster's house, then turned around the corner of a mill and headed towards the widow Ma's thatched house.</p>
<p>The door was fastened with a hemp rope, which he noticed after knocking for a while without hearing a response from inside. "Where has this hussy gone again?" he said angrily to himself, and was about to turn around and go back to the workshop. But something seemed to be bewitching him, making him feel reluctant and hesitant. "No! I can't go back, no matter what, I must find her," he muttered to himself. Suddenly, he cocked his head and listened, because he heard a burst of laughter, a bold, shameless clamor, wafting over from the silvery edge of the grassland.</p>
<p>He felt angry, but also a little sad, he was stung by jealousy. So he hurried off towards the grassland.</p>
<p>On the grassland, the laughter and shouts of a group of people were resonating. The sanxian accompanied shameless songs. He heard a sharp voice, it was the voice of the widow Ma! It was also trembling there, causing his chest to burn with anger.</p>
<p>He stood for a while, thinking, then hid under a juniper tree, squinting and looking out over the grassland. He saw two lively little stars twinkling in the naked grassland, under the misty sunlight. It must be her, he believed. He also saw the two little stars suddenly start running, followed by a young, rude shadow. They were running along the grassland, along the ridges, running... Finally, the little stars lost their light and fell to the ground, which meant that her disheveled hair or any part of her body was grabbed and pinned to the ground. Then he heard a sharp, hoarse struggle, screaming, with lewd curses, but the sound of the sanxian and the shameless songs quickly drowned everything out. Wang Da trembled, he regretted coming here, he hated this beautiful moonlit night, he was angry at this group of shameless thugs: why do people want to humiliate her?…</p>
<p>He thought angrily.</p>
<p>On the grassland, fatigue was spreading among these young men and women. They walked back to the village, excited and satisfied, singing as they went. But she, the widow Ma, was still there, she might be longing for something, or perhaps expecting something, but no one could tell, because she was pondering while facing the moon. The grassland was quiet, and everything had become more desolate due to the moon's embrace. Wang Da, realizing that everyone had run far away, quietly crawled out from under the juniper tree and quickly walked towards the grassland.</p>
<p>He ran, ran, ran recklessly, finally stopping behind her. This sudden appearance made her feel flustered and shocked, but he just smiled coldly and sat down beside her silently. A terrible storm was raging in his heart and causing him great pain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the silence, he was startled by a sharp, hoarse laugh. He looked up, and it was that pair of little stars twinkling with light, it was that lewd laughter from those filthy, shameless lips. He remembered: the singing, the mournful sound of the sanxian, the naked dancing, he was furious, his hands were trembling. An impulse, an unconscious excitement was urging and tormenting him. So, he unnaturally reached out his hand, pulled out the waist knife he was carrying from his pocket for self-defense, and angrily thrust it into her back. Crimson blood spurted out like a gushing spring. She only laughed weakly twice, then limply collapsed into his warm embrace.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Turmoil <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>His painfully myopic eyes stared at the blank manuscript paper in the dark night, feeling the cold air seeping from the cement floor, which made him feel numb and achy as he wrote. His wife occasionally raised her troubled eyes, stealthily watching his motionless back bent over the desk, holding her breath, only hearing the rustling sound of the pen tip moving across the paper. The short hand on the table clock was already past twelve. She sighed wearily:</p>
<p>"Wei! Go to sleep, your eyes are important! Don't go blind!"</p>
<p>He turned his head and glanced at her disheveled hair and her sallow face, reminding him of her beautiful, plump face when they were newly married four or five years ago, now sucked dry and pale by demons. Her charming eyes had been replaced by red, swollen circles. What about himself? He was still wearing the same plain glasses from four years ago, and every night he continued to work with painful eyes. For his family, for his children, for the mounting debts, for the food of the family of six, for the four months of rent, he had to forget his own suffering, which felt like being cruelly whipped, and write those worthless articles, squeezing out bitter juice.</p>
<p>He sighed, glared at the ticking clock, and crept into the warm quilt during the quiet moments when the north wind was blowing outside the window.</p>
<p>In the morning, he was awakened by the clamor and the crying of the children. He hurriedly put on his clothes and ran out of the door of the small room in the attic. He saw his elderly mother moving her toothless mouth, her sunken small eyes tightly wrinkled, her high cheekbones sharply protruding, her face looking even more yellow and frightening. He, as her son, had grown accustomed to this sight and didn't find it particularly scary. She grumbled and scolded, waving her hands and stamping her feet as if she was acting in a play. He couldn't help but feel annoyed. He blinked his eyes and glanced down at his wife, whose tear-stained face was pouting with grievance, and the baby in her arms was crying incessantly.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Why are you making such a racket first thing in the morning!"</p>
<p>"She scolded me for no reason and even wanted to hit me." Tears streamed down his wife's face.</p>
<p>"You young people, I'm like an old nanny to you! But you have no conscience, I have no clothes to wear, you have money, but you won't give me a penny!"</p>
<p>"What's worth you making such a fuss? If you don't want to do it, let her do it. I told you not to do it a long time ago, but you insisted on doing it, making a racket all day long!"</p>
<p>His wife was sobbing, and the child was crying loudly.</p>
<p>"She even dropped the child, you heartless woman!"</p>
<p>"I never thought you would treat me like this one day, you have money but you won't do me a favor, you won't even pay off my debts."</p>
<p>"God knows, my forty-odd dollars of manuscript fees this month, thirty dollars for rent, ten dollars for you to pay off debts, but you spent it all on pointless favors. And you still pressure me..."</p>
<p>He almost burst into tears, anger and sorrow intermingling:</p>
<p>"The older you get, the more heartless you become!"</p>
<p>But his mother threw something on the ground with a thud and started stomping her feet like a madwoman, shaking her head, walking back and forth, stretching out her wrinkled hands, pointing to the sky and the earth, and sighing deeply:</p>
<p>"It's all the women who encouraged you..."</p>
<p>This heartbreaking scene made him forget that the reason for their increasingly eccentric personalities and their inability to get along was due to the difficult social environment. Because of their various provocations, his heart was filled with a mixture of sorrow and resentment:</p>
<p>"If you keep arguing like this, I can't take it anymore, I'm leaving!"</p>
<p>He thought he was speaking from a sincere resolution, rubbed his tired and painful eyes, looked at his mother's mad appearance, sighed, and lowered his head.</p>
<p>"Then leave, I don't want such an unfilial son either."</p>
<p>This time, the flames of long-suppressed distress in his heart truly erupted.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving, don't regret it, don't..." He had always been reluctant to leave this prison-like home, retreating from the path of progress back into this declining circle, just trying to find a way to keep them from starving. Now, that fantasy had disappeared like a dream, and a string of memories made his eyes water.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Seeking a Jail Meal to Fill the Stomach <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>It seems that someone once said that people live their lives in contradictions. Judging from the facts, this is absolutely true. Not to mention that a person's thoughts and thoughts, thoughts and actions are constantly in contradiction and conflict; even the progress of history and society does not develop forward in contradiction. As for today's chaotic socio-economic organization, contradictory situations are exposed everywhere. For example, "Give me liberty, or give me death" is a rational motto for human survival. Our ancestors, our companions, fought and sacrificed heroically for "freedom" in order to achieve collective and individual survival—freely. However, today, we have many, many people, some of whom are forced, enslaved, and deprived of "freedom," while others "voluntarily" (?) sell their freedom and sacrifice their freedom in order to obtain temporary survival.</p>
<p>For example, recently, a fact has proven this to us: According to reports, the First Special District captured a thief named Chen Jinhai, who is over thirty years old; he was sentenced to three years in prison by the First Special District Court for theft. Last September, he was released from prison and went to Nanjing, where he committed another crime and was sentenced to six months; this February, he came to Shanghai and sneaked into the Gongwu Stage and the Great World three times to steal. He was recently arrested and sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. When the judge questioned him, Chen Jinhai admitted to the repeated theft crimes without hesitation. He even asked the court to punish him severely, saying, "I can't find a way to make a living outside. After being sentenced, I can still have jail meals to fill my stomach." Sure enough, in addition to the judge sentencing him to two years in prison, he even felt that the sentence was too short.</p>
<p>Imprisonment, as everyone knows, is a punishment for criminals who are temporarily or permanently deprived of "freedom." Not to mention that daily life there is many times lower than that of ordinary people, but being confined day and night without the slightest freedom is not what people want! Many criminals who are in prison demand that the court give them a light sentence and reduce their sentence, hoping to encounter an "amnesty" and get out of prison early to "restore my freedom." These are all reasonable and normal things. But now, some people voluntarily ask to be severely punished and imprisoned for a long time. This seems to be contrary to reason. However, the reason is that "after being sentenced, there are still jail meals to fill the stomach."</p>
<p>Originally, "appetite" is not only a function that we humans, from adults to newborn infants, cannot lack, but also a prerequisite for survival shared by general animals. However, "eating is difficult" has become a common saying among people today. For the sake of "eating," humans compete with each other, exclude each other, and even commit crimes, commit suicide, and kill each other... This has become an inevitable trend of the times! Therefore, even though everyone knows that imprisonment deprives them of freedom, there is still something that "fills the stomach" and prolongs their survival function.</p>
<p>Here, we really don't know how many people in today's social organization are like Chen Jinhai? Moreover, we don't know how many people have noticed this kind of social contradictory fact and are trying to thoroughly change it?</p>
<h3 id="e217">Suosuo Beach (Part 1) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Following the usual practice, I took the leftover coarse rice from last night, which was hanging under the eaves of the house, added some lukewarm water, and swallowed it. It was quite difficult to find some pickles in these mountains and fields, no, even some very plain soy sauce was often lacking.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper catered to small merchants passing by, and occasionally some simple travelers. There was no need to prepare a large amount of supplies in terms of demand. One trip to the market could cope with three or five days. In Lao Nao's imagination, there would be no danger of running out of supplies. However, this time, our group made him dizzy. He wanted to scrounge up some soy sauce, but the result was still a disappointment.</p>
<p>—Never mind, the rice has already gone into the stomach, who cares if there are vegetables or not—A Huang glanced at Lao Zhang, Lao Zhang understood this tacit signal very clearly. He ran to the front and whispered a few words to the two porters, raised his purple-brown arm, and shouted in a voice that the porters didn't want to hear—</p>
<p>—Let's go, head to Suosuo Beach!</p>
<p>So, we rushed out of Zhengzhi Street and headed onto the official road that was buried in the invisible path.</p>
<p>Standing at the head of Suosuo Beach, we began to consider, —travel by land or wade through the water? These two questions lingered in my mind, and no consensus was reached. Finally, it was decided to separate into two groups. Those who preferred to travel by land were free to do so, and those who wanted to wade were welcome to come. I joined the latter group, and jumped onto the large wooden boat that was next to the beach.</p>
<p>The porters' faces had a different expression, and the reason was not difficult to guess. From here to Xiejiachuan, the waterway was twenty li long. Although it was not a long distance (in the porters' vocabulary), life was tightly pressing down on them, not allowing them to breathe easily. It was extremely difficult to get a good night's sleep or enough to eat. If they could get twenty li of rest, they would probably consider it the ultimate luxury?</p>
<p>After that, a group of people led a portion of the luggage, and walked through the dense bushes. I couldn't see them, how could I describe them? Those porters' faces shared a common, indescribable expression!</p>
<p>The wooden boat did not have any equipment like awnings. It was very similar to the boats used to transport goods on the Suzhou River. There were two people rowing, one was an old man covered in frost, and the other was a child with a milky complexion. The capacity inside was quite large, with a sedan chair, four stretchers, five or six carrying poles, and a dozen or so passengers. The weight was also considerable.</p>
<p>Not far from where the boat was tied up, a large stone stood in the middle of the river. Many words were carved on one side, the largest two characters were "Divine Stone," and below were some stories about the Divine Stone. Asking the old man rowing the boat, he felt that it possessed "divine" energy. During stormy nights, when the hot summer weather was struck by sudden hailstorms, and the entire universe seemed about to explode, the "Divine Stone" would descend from the sky, graze the roofs of many villages and towns that were not built firmly, without being damaged at all. The stone roared, and stopped on the shore of the beach, allowing passing travelers to look at its majestic posture. The Divine Stone had considerable value.</p>
<h3 id="e218">In the Great Pine Forest <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Tales of the Jianghu</p>
<p>One summer, I wandered to a small city in the north, where I suddenly contracted a dangerous local epidemic. Looking back at the situation, it felt like a nightmare. The name of the epidemic was a palindrome, quite difficult to remember; even the name of that small city, I cannot clearly recall now. I only remember that more than ten li away from the small city was a great pine forest, and the story happened in that forest, a painful story that I will never forget!</p>
<p>The small city was surrounded by mountains, and in the summer, the dangerous epidemic spread everywhere. The owner of the inn where I stayed had once been a member of the Green Forest (bandits). When I fell ill, he personally concocted local herbal remedies for me, and it was not until the autumn coolness arrived that I escaped danger. For almost half a year, I did not pay him a single coin for lodging and meals, and he generously saved my life. When I wanted to continue my wandering life, he earnestly urged me to stay. He said:</p>
<p>"In the first half of my life, I killed and set fires, doing many wicked things. Now I run this inn to help travelers and make up for my sins. You are young and do not know the dark side of the Jianghu. It's not worth it to throw away your life for nothing. I simply want to keep you here to be my helper, but if you really want to leave, I won't force you."</p>
<p>I agreed without hesitation to stay at the inn. Originally, I was wandering everywhere with my life in the hands of others. I couldn't betray the owner's kindness, and perhaps living in that small city could increase my experience, because all kinds of Jianghu figures came and went in the inn every day.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and soon it was winter, with heavy snow falling. The inn had no business in the winter because the great pine forest was obscured by snow more than a foot thick, and the roads were impassable. Moreover, the great pine forest was not a clean place; passersby were often beheaded and hung upside down on the pine branches. But since the opening of that inn, those acts of robbery and murder had gradually decreased. After living in the inn for a long time, the owner knew my story. His name was Little Yellow Dragon, and his name was well-known in the northern regions. He was like a chivalrous thief in old novels, robbing the rich to help the poor. He had more than two hundred apprentices under him, all living with him. When he washed his hands (retired from banditry), his apprentices strongly opposed it. They were used to that kind of robbing life, and no one was willing to accept Little Yellow Dragon's distributed money and, as he instructed, start small businesses to make a living.</p>
<p>One day, while it was snowing heavily, we were drinking by the brazier. He threw the old Mauser pistol he wore at his waist onto the table and pointed at it, saying:</p>
<p>"It was this gun that I used to kill my favorite apprentice! He was the one who most opposed my washing my hands!"</p>
<p>The raging flames reflected on his purplish-red cheeks. His eyes stared at me without blinking, and he cried out with two drops of clear tears: "He looked exactly like you, child! That's why I want you to stay here. Seeing you is like seeing him."</p>
<p>It was the first time I had seen a rough man cry like a girl, and I was deeply moved by him.</p>
<p>"Now," he continued, "those two hundred-plus men have split into many small gangs and are still working as bandits, but they don't dare come near my place. But I know that one day I will be hurt by them. They hate me to the bone."</p>
<p>As the snow was about to melt, a merchant came to the inn. He stayed for two days, always talking to Little Yellow Dragon every day. He said that he wanted to go to the provincial capital to see his father who was ill, and he was carrying a lot of silver with him. He didn't dare to cross that great pine forest alone, but he didn't state his final request. Little Yellow Dragon patted his chest:</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean. I have a child watching the store. I'll help you with the trip!"</p>
<p>The next day they set off. Before leaving, Little Yellow Dragon drank a large amount of wine, loaded his old Mauser pistol with bullets, and told me to take good care of the store. He would send the merchant across the great pine forest and return immediately, at most in two days.</p>
<p>But on the fourth day, he still hadn't returned to the store. I remembered what he had said that night when he cried. Perhaps he had encountered some danger. Two more days passed, and he still hadn't appeared. I couldn't bear it any longer and went after him to the great pine forest. Because it was already the season of melting snow, the road was very muddy and difficult to walk, and I didn't know the way. For two days and nights, I got lost in the great pine forest, never able to get out of the forest's range. I hadn't eaten a grain of rice for two days, and I was so weak that I couldn't walk. I grabbed a small branch to support myself and walked in circles. When I fell to the ground, I found some clothes of both of them, hanging high on a large pine tree like torn banners, and a pair of dried persimmon bags were right beside me. After eating my fill, I ran wildly in the pine forest again, but I never found their bodies.</p>
<p>This is almost ten years ago, but when I write it down, it feels like it happened yesterday.</p>

<p>Liya (Snatching to speak): You're really something! You find it strange and laughable, don't you?</p>
<p>Jinghong: Oh! Please don't be upset. Look, your face is red, and your neck is getting thicker. I'm truly sorry! Miss Jin, please forgive me! (Followed by a contemptuous fake laugh.)</p>
<p>Liya (Coldly): Hmph! You don't need to apologize to me, and you don't need to deliberately stimulate me with that humorous laughter, friend! Oh! Suzhou sister! Goodbye.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Very well! My Suzhou sister, you should rest and recuperate. Pay attention to your health; that is the most important thing in life. Anger is most harmful to your health, Suzhou sister, go and rest, goodbye! Let's shake hands, even when angry, it doesn't mean one shouldn't be polite!</p>
<p>Liya: But politeness doesn't necessarily mean it won't give an angry person a headache.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Since you don't want to shake hands with me, I don't necessarily have to keep my hand out. Look, haven't I picked up my teacup to drink tea again? (Sound of drinking tea) Why don't you have a sip of tea before you go back?</p>
<p>News from the Theater Scene</p>
<p>Weekly Experimental Theater Revitalizes; Ant Troupe Performs at Lake Society</p>
<p>The Weekly Experimental Theater, after performing "The Proposal," "Freedom," and "Medicine" at the New Light Theater last week, has received much praise from all walks of life. However, the New Light's facilities are not suitable for public plays. Therefore, they have been contacting theaters more suitable for public play performances, but none have been successful due to conditions. Now they are doing their best to improve the shortcomings of the New Light as much as possible and have decided to perform next Sunday (the 21st). The plays are: "A Corner of the Metropolis" (Original by Xu Peiwai, published in the December issue of "Literature" last year), "Autumn Sun" (Author Zhang Geng, published in "Reading Life"), and "Smuggling" (Author Hong Shen, published in the recently released "Guangming Semi-Monthly").</p>
<p>At the same time, we received news that the Ant Troupe will also perform "Smuggling," "Who Killed the Baby," and "Horn, Third Script" at the Lake Society on Beijing Road on the 23rd (Tuesday).</p>

<p>Starring Huarez Pyle</p>
<p>Huarez Pyle, although born with a very ugly face, is praised by movie fans all over the world as an amazing artist. His clumsy, explosive, and witty acting skills are unparalleled in Hollywood. This time, he was invited by the 20th Century Fox Company to work with the handsome John Bowers and the beautiful actress White Beilan Stanley in the historical war epic "A Message to Garcia," The story of the film is taken from the Cuban people in 1898, who, under the leadership of General Garcia, revolted against the Spanish government. The United States intervened, but because Garcia was known to be leading his troops in ambush in the forest and his location was unknown, President McKinley personally ordered Lieutenant Rowan to take a secret letter to Cuba, try to deliver it to Garcia, and inform the landing site of the US military, so that they could unite and defeat the Spanish army. The performances of the three artists in this film have achieved great success. After watching this film, one feels that the historical facts of that year, which determined the fate of the three countries with a roar, are vividly brought to life. The film is released in Grand Light today (Sunday).</p>

<p>The long-awaited new film "Diamond King" starring famous actors has now been decided to be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater tomorrow (the 20th). This is news worth reporting to audiences who love domestic films.</p>
<p>The film is directed by Mr. Xu Xinfu. In the recent past, Director Xu's "Rogue Horse" must have left a deep impression on everyone's minds. This "Diamond King" is his more elaborate masterpiece. The tension and bizarre plot, and the grand and thrilling scenes are guaranteed. In terms of actors, Gu Lanjun plays a socialite, Wang Zhengxin plays the chief detective, Gu Meijun plays the female detective, and Xie Yunqing, Sun Yu, and Li Qing play the villains. Each performance is truly superb and seamless.</p>
<p>"Diamond King" tells you about the masks of civilized people in the upper class, the unscrupulous behavior of villains, the results of modernized women, and the indomitable spirit of law-abiding civil servants.</p>
<p>This is a work that hints at certain current questions! A rare opportunity, don't miss it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road presents the amazing and latest Soviet film "New Soviet Youth," which the Soviet Union has devoted all its resources and a huge sum of money to actively develop film art and compete with Hollywood and the European film industry. It is a representative of the Soviet national people, and it uses very flexible methods to depict vividly the lives, entertainment, love, heartbreak, awakening, hard work, and inventions of modern Soviet youth, and how they finally achieve final victory. The whole film is full of youthful vigor, new atmosphere, and new life, and is a good example needed by all the peoples of the world, and also a good model needed by the modern Chinese masters of China who bear a major responsibility. It is indeed a truly and thoroughly cautionary film that instructs young people to have a spirit of perseverance, pulling back from the brink, and unremittingly struggling against adverse environments, and is a masterpiece that young people must see. The Chinese idiom "If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll only be sad when you're old!" is the purpose of the film, and at the same time, the world-famous "Soviet News" is also shown, including the grand celebration of the 18th anniversary of the Soviet revolution, which is very valuable.</p>
