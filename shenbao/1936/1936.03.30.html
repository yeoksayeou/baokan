<h3>保甲運動的重要推行（上）　內政部警政司司長李松風</h3>
<p>一，保甲運軔的意義和現勢</p>
<p>要知道保甲運動的意義，先要明白「保甲」是什麽？按照一般的解釋，說「保」就是把民月編組起來的行政，「甲」就是把壯丁編制起來的行政，保甲的功能，就是編査戶口壯丁它的目的則是在實行自衛。這種解檡，不能說是錯誤的；但是我們覺得未免失之狹隘。因爲保甲制度的精義，絕不是「自衛」兩個字所能盡之的；實在可以說它是驢一個具有綜合的政治。經濟。敎育。治安各方面效能的制度。我們如果要簡單一點說，也可以講就是組織民眾的。種制度。什麼是「保甲運動」呢？那便是以實垷保甲制度爲目的所採的種步驟的總稱。</p>
<p>保甲制度，不是一個新發明的東西，它的實質，遠在周秦就存在了。到了北宋的時候，這個制度無論實質或形式都正式確立，那就是有名的「王荆公保甲法」。宋朝以後，歷朝的辦法雖然有變革，但是保甲的精神是。貫的存在着。最近保甲運動的與起，可以說是保甲制度演進的一個階段，並不是。種新制度的創定。</p>
<p>關於保甲制度的歷史的發展，我們固然不必去談它，可是保甲運動的最近情形，我們似乎應該稍微加以說明：——我們知道，最近的保甲運動，是應該從二十一年八月劃一個新時期；因爲在此以前，各省雖然也有推行保甲的，可是小規模的，部份的；到了二十一年八月，豫　皖二省剿匪總部制定了剿匪區內各縣編査保甲戶口條例，通飭剿匪區內各省認眞辦理，從這時起，正式的大規枚的保甲運動，纔算在　實上展開了。因爲剿匪區內各省辦理保甲極著成效，允其在淸鄉方面成縱最爲　著，所以剿匪區外各省，也逐漸採用，於是推行日廣。倒了民國廿三年十月，內政部因爲各省辦理保甲者日多，而許多現行制度，都受到施行保甲的影響，認爲應該將保甲運動的基礎，和推行呆甲與其他制度的關係，早日確立和調整；所以就呈請行政院，轉呈中央政治會議，提出第四三二次會議决議：「地方保甲工作，關係地方警衛，爲地方自治之基礎，應由行政院通令各省市提前辦理」。這就是保甲運動在中央法制所建立的鞏固基礎。根據這個决議，行政院通令全國各省市遵照辦理。現在已經辦保甲的地方，，有豫·鄂·皖·贛·閩·蘇·浙·湘·甘·陝·綏·寗·京·平十四省市：正在籌辦的，有河北等省：不可謂不廣。同時內政部，立發院，都再努力研究保甲與各種政制的關係，想替保甲制度，建樹法履基礎。第五次全國代表大會以後，中央增設地方自治計劃委員會，對於保甲統一法規的頒訂，不久是一定可以實現的。</p>
<p>二，保甲運動的重要</p>
<p>以上簡單的談過了保甲運動的意義和現勢，現在我們再進一步講到保甲運動的重要。我們知道，保甲就是一種民衆組織，以這個組織爲根據，可以發揮它的效能到各方面夫；因此它的重要性，必須從多方面來觀察，並不是很單純的。</p>
<p>從組織民眾方面觀察——國家以人民爲　成分子，而把許多人民來　成國家，就要依賴組織，所以，沒有組識就不能成爲國家。怎樣組織人民？各國辦法不同，大都依照本國環境來决定。政治。經濟。宗敎。文化……種種的組織，合起來就是構成社會國家的組織。不過在許多種組織之中，必要有一種中心組織，這個組織不但是組成社會的中心，而且是各種組織的中心；這種中心組織，就是各國的地方自冶組織。過去我國入民的中心組織，是家族，範圍過狹，有加以擴充之必要；因此近來我們便也採用地方自治的組織。不過，外國的地方自治，是以人爲本位的，這一點與我們過去的「家」本位，多少也有些不同。個人本位的地方自治組織，我們必須完成，是不成問題的；但是因爲歷史的因襲，和敎育程度的低下，施行上自不免有許多困難，至少在現在和最近的將來，其情形是會如此的，所以我們要組織民眾，似乎還不應拋棄這個「家」的組織基礎。保甲制度，統楚以家爲基礎的組織方法，近年來我們從事實上的經騐，知道在剿匪方面，保甲較自治的效果爲强，這就是在現階段以「家」爲基礎的組織民眾方法，比較以「人」爲基礎的組織方法爲强的證明。現在中國正遭逢空前的國難，要想渡過這個難關，那唯有組織全國民眾，共同努力；最好的組織民眾的方法，就是「保甲」。所以當前的保甲運動，實在是最重要的一件事。</p>
<p>從鞏固國防方面觀察——大家都知道有一句格言：「無國防即無國家。」所以國家和國防，是不能分離的。我們要維持國家，必須先整頓國防。現代的國坊固以軍隊爲中心，但國防的要件，並不止於軍隊；它的範圍，大一點講可以包括全國的一切，國民的全體都是戰鬥員，各部門產業都要加入戰爭；所以才有所謂「國民總動員」這個名詞。一國的國民怎樣纔可以總動員？怎樣總動員纔可以有最大的效果？這必須看它的國民平時是不是有組織。有訓練。所謂訓練，必須先有組織，組織以後也必須施以訓練，這兩件事是不應該分開的。所以組織和訓練民眾，是國上最重要的事情。關於組織，前面講過了，在現在的中國，當然最好的莫過於「保甲」；關於訓練的施行，也是以利用「保甲」爲最適富。——因爲：第一，保甲是普遍的組織，適合總動員的要求；第二，保甲有「家」爲其確實基礎，便於統制；第三，從保甲本身的性質上講，也有訓練的需要。依保甲而編組的壯丁隊，就是一個受調練的組織。自衛戰爭，需要全國人民共同協力，保甲組織就是粘合全國人民共同協力的士敏土，自衛戰爭，固然不需要個個人上前錢，但是必須個個人都在戰爭目的下而活動，並且是集體活動，保甲就是實現人民集體活動的工具。所以從國防上看來，保甲也是特別重要的。</p>
<p>從保社會治安方面覜察——社會治安的維持，不　積極的，消極的兩種。積極的就是對於危害治安的事態加以排除；消極的，就是使危害治安的因素，不能發生或存在。兩者相較，自然以消極的方法最善，如果消極的方法能　生效，就沒有再使用積極的方法的必要了，警察的責任，是維持治安，雖然也有所謂預防警察，但在實際上警察效能的表現，還是以事後的救濟爲多。要想能達到完全的預防，决不是警察的力量所可單獨奏效的，必須有待於人民自身的努力；所以人民自衛，是特別需要的。保甲這種組織，旣有編査戶口爲基礎，叉有聯保速坐切結和保甲規的來繩範，用連帶方法與利害關係，把人民聯繫成一個整體；不但外來危害無從侵入，即內部危害因素也無由發生：其結果乃自然達到消極的保衛社會治安的效果。因爲保甲在這一點上，效果特別顯習，所以纔惹起許多人認爲保甲是單純的自衛組織，這也很可以從反面證明保甲在維持治安上的重要了。（未完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>倫敦會議後歐洲局勢的分析</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>德國霹靂一聲撕毀了羅卡諾公的把白里安與斯脫萊斯曼遺留下來的一些成就剷除無餘了現在德國回復到普魯士的傳統的精神法國也回復到拉丁民族的傳統的恐懼劃分德法邊境的萊茵河水又將爲歐洲兩大民族的失和而鳴咽了</p>
<p>倫敦會議失敗後卽謂歐洲將發生戰爭固屬言之過早然而這决會議失敗的影響之大却不能忽視我們又將見新的軍事同盟代替舊的集體安全積極的軍擴代替消極的軍縮秘密的外交代替公開的外交國際間主張推翻現狀企圖火中取栗者成一陣營主張維持現狀擁護集體安全者又成一陣營這種形勢固然不是由這决倫敦會議失敗後才開始然而到了目前變爲更白熱化更露骨化更其象化了</p>
<p>維持現狀的陣營粗略地分析起來以法蘇爲其骨幹而以小協的爲其羽翼反對現狀的陣營以德國爲重鎭而以波蘭布加利亞爲其羽翼英國則復返其傳統政策維持大陸的均勢然而我們如果就歐洲目前的形勢詳細地分析一番就可知道歐洲各國因利害不同旨趣各別卽同屬一陣營懷抱亦大有出入羅卡諾重要担保國之英意既與法國鬧別扭則法蘇的更趨接近自屬意中事捷克與羅馬尼亞外交上向惟法國馬首是瞻而捷克與蘇聯復有互助公的的簽訂德國的東向發展政策允足使捷克羅馬尼亞爲法蘇的忠實衛星所可注意者乃小協約中的南斯拉夫近年來德國在南斯拉夫購買大量的農產品南國接近德國的色彩頗爲濃厚可是一到重要關頭究竟向德呢還是親　還須看歐洲事態的發展才能斷定南國的歸向這是我們耍了解未來歐洲形勞者不可忽略的一點</p>
<p>就反對現狀的陣容講波蘭與德有十年不侵犯條的的簽訂德波關係趨於　密由來已久不過介於德俄兩大間的波蘭畏懼德國同時也畏懼蘇聯它不願德國軍隊通過其國境正如不願俄國軍隊通過其國境一樣所以波蘭的親德是迫於威勢並非完全出於它的本心將來能吾爲德國的忠實同盟者還是一個疑問</p>
<p>就目前形勢講德國在歐洲的地位依然十分孤立必須獲得另一法西主義國家意大利的援助聲勢方可大盛但德國欲染指於奧匈而意大利又視奧匈爲禁　利害衝突無法調和雖這兩體系相同的國家最近秘密會商以謀結合但結果顯極渺茫德國沒有强大的與國恐怕還不能有所作爲她的唯一希望是英國援助但英國一直到現在仍是騎了兩頭馬它希望法國以寬大的胸襟解除目前的難題又希望德國對於歐洲和平有所貢獻以消釋德國所造成的歐洲緊張形勢可是法國却無寬大的胸襟德國更無和平的貢獻而英國也終必如對於以前的其他歐洲事伴一樣模棱兩可以不了了之這結果終必醞釀而成一個不可收拾的局面倫敦會議的失敗就是一個先兆</p>

<h3>川行散記</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>三　永川之行</p>
<p>一個偶然的機會，使我能够到永川去，看到四川的內地情形。永川是沿江的一縣，在重慶上流二百四十里。城市並不濱江，有九十里的距離，正在成渝公路的孔道上，我是搭乘公路局的長途汽車去的。關於這公路的腐敗，我簡直不能用字句來說明。記得有一位洋人的中國遊記說：津浦路的藍鋼車像搖籃一般把他搖到上海。那末，天啊！我要怎樣在字典中選擇一個恰當而並不誇張的名詞來形容這成渝路上行車的模樣！</p>
<p>車在山上，山間，山中行進着。有時迴旋升降，有時在山凹裏，有時穿過深隧底山洞。兩旁懸崖削壁，奇險欲絕。如果不經意地偷吻了磷殉底怪石，或者翻落下萬丈底深岩，沒有不撞破腦袋的。這景象我只在電影裏曾經見過。中途遇雨，一絲絲從窗縫裏吹進來，還從車頂上滴下，沒有地方可以躱藏。但是，走完了這短短的程途，正午的驕陽，仍然高張起火傘。我拖着五小時拳曲後麻痺底身軀，移動着沈重底脚步，躑躅在街頭。征塵僕僕的臉色下，藏着疲倦。打濕了又曬乾底衣服，不成樣子。如此一個當地的陌生客，是足够引起後面的狗在吠的。我想起了自己正同初進費拉特爾斐亞的富蘭克林差不多。</p>
<p>這時候，我知道因爲軍部扣車，上下的客車都沒有了，剛纔搭來的乃是最後的一决。正彷徨着時，見到一輛軍用車，就用情商的手段搭上去，那知道意外的不幸立刻就緊隨着這意外的獲得。駛了不過三四十里，這前綫奔波了兩個多月的破碎底車身，等不到回家休息就出了毛病。於是我們大家帮同着修補車胎，整理機件，依然沒有效果。時間一小時一小時的過去，太陽已經慢慢地藏到山背後，夜幕又漸漸地張開了。沒有一個行人經過，也望不見一縷炊煙。這是够危險的，荒凉底郊野，隨時可以遭受意外底襲擊，而我更不敢太信任那幾位糾糾的八先生。焦急變成恐懼了，期待着要來臨的是什麼。呀！天無絕人之路！西邊開下一輛漏網的客車來了！說盡了所有的好話，又先付了超過常價的車資，纔讓我擠了上去。可是大半的路程必須在黑暗中摸索，剛鬆下的心弦又緊張起來，張大着眼皮，比司機者更當心地前望着。一切都交在他的轉輪上了</p>
<p>永川是山水奇麗的所在，可是到處枯燥，沒有水源。城裹祗有一條黃色的泥溝，取飲滌穢，均在於此，那邊的水從衛生的觀點，是很不宜做飲料的。我到永川是預備吃苦的，但是飲食的不慣使我不得不憂慮到健康。所以我在永川住了月餘，就離開了。</p>
<p>四　嘉陵江之秋</p>
<p>紅葉飄零，景物荒凉的深秋，嘉陵江的秋色却正像西子湖的春光一般吸引着遊展。渝合間（重慶與合川之間）的小輪，帶我到北碚的溫泉公園去，那是嘉陵江中流的勝蹟而爲外間所稱道遊踪所麕至的地方。颷輪在鼓動着江水前進，猶如玉濺珠翻。兩岸的靑山，點綴着綠疇林木，使人忘記了這是瀟颯的晚秋，而疑心到春天永留在此間。入觀音峽時，大石盤據中流，瀑布飛瀉如雨。這種秀麗的景色，較之三峽的雄偉，別有一種趣味。它是一首抒情詩，明快而閑適，令人有悠然意遠的感覺。如果嗜遊者以三峽爲盛饌，那末嘉陵江正是一道精緻的點心。</p>
<p>到北碚，上岸遊覽。溫泉公園在碚的上流三里，以溫泉爲中心，就山勢闢爲遊樂之所，乃峽防局附設事業的一種。我們到達後、先入澣塵溫泉試浴，以蘇息半日來局促輪中的疲勞。泉有二，千頃波爲露天而湧泉池在室內。池中熱氣蒸騰，白霧濛濛，池水從穴口傾瀉而入，溫度恰與體溫適合，含多量的石灰質，雖嚴冬不寒。其實，泉之發源於此山者無不溫。山麓有麵粉廠，就利用此在奔而下的溫泉水做旋轉機輪的原動力。</p>
<p>浴罷遊園。園的前身爲溫泉寺，乃宋代古剎，至今猶存。寺藏古物頗多，其高與人齊的明代浮雕蟠龍香盤，最爲可觀。大殿上覆鐵瓦，古色斑爛，令人想見皤然老僧，人定其中，眞有物外之思了。出寺經攏湫道而至飛雪岩，瀑布瀉出於兩峰之間，狀如匹練。經竹蔭深處的蘭谷而入乳花洞，洞極曲折深隧，黑暗中時露天光，鐘乳懸垂，叩之發金石聲，至最深處隱的聞泉聲，不能更窮其極。折回穿另一洞口而出，始豁然開朗。</p>
<p>暮宿數帆樓。樓臨江而築，片片江帆，歷歷可數。夜潮初發時，星淡雲流，烟靄若瘴。樹動風寒，秋聲乃作。高峰射影入江，疑爲山魅。我覺得溫泉公園之勝，不在園，亦不在泉，而在於一種不可以言傳的山水的媚力，使人陶溶其中，有願老是鄉之感。</p>
<p>翌日，遊縉雲寺。寺亦古刹，在縉雲山中，距溫泉十五里。由園左上山里許，登飛來閣。俯視深峽，窈然而低藏。眼波橫碧，如帶迴環。迤邐而上，過紹龍寺沿溪行。穿松林，聽松濤。入茂林，隱蔽天日。縉雲寺藏深谷中，殿宇爲羣峰所嶂。正當山行疲憊的時侯，忽睹共地，其有「柳暗花明又一村」的情景。寺中附設漢藏理敎院，習藏文，窮佛理，牧牧其中者，亦大有人在。寺後獅峰，望之蔚然高聳，靑翠欲滴。以日暮未登爲憾。</p>
<p>溫泉倦遊後，參觀北碚的各項新建設事業。北陪的建設事業，以嘉陵江中的治安機關峽防局爲發動中心。屬於研究性質的有中國西部科學院，設生物，地質，理化，及農林四研究所。生物研究所中採集植物標本一萬餘號，昆虫標本三萬餘號，曾迭决與國內外博物館交換標本。理化研究所歷年曾搜集並化騐川東及川鄂邊境的鑛石數百種。農林研究所有農塲一百餘畝，試種各種植物及飼養蜂種等。地質研究所將於三年內完成二十萬分之一的四川地質土壤圖。該院設備完善，實爲我國西部的惟一科學領導機關。其附設的兼善初中，位於小山之上，執敎奢卽爲院中專家，頗爲發達。博物館中的風物陳列室最爲特別，而亦最富趣味。所陳物品，都自康藏採取而來。如各種夷文的書法，宗敎的儀具，及士人的服飾等等。屬於社會敎育的有圖書館，體育塲及平民公園等。公園在火熖山上，有松聲閣旁觀亭之盛。因山築舍，就石鑒池，小徑修平，無傴僂之勞。登瞭遠台，則江景如畫，盡收眼底矣。屬於交通事業的有北川鐵路，交通於白廟子大田坎之間，長的三十華里，爲川省僅有的鐵道。小如電車，行半山上，俯視深峽，不覺慄慄。鐵路兩旁，都爲採煤礦穴，以天府媒礦公司爲巨擘。這條鐵路的用途，事實上僅限於運煤而已。屬於工業性質的，有三峽染織工廠，出布匹，毛布，毯襪之類，與上海三友實業社相仿。他若嘉陵江日報及地方醫院等，皆莫不爲峽區居民謀福利。而主持之人，精神極佳，無不以服務事業爲職志，絕無絲毫私利思想，更爲可佩。最近省府劃北陪爲建設實騐區，前途的發展，是有無限希望的。</p>

<h3>粵桂實業考察團報告（八）</h3>
<p>— 仰寄自桂林</p>
<p>桂省之出入口貿易</p>
<p>廣西之商業槪况因各都市發展之程度而不同，梧州地處桂粵之耍道，交通便利，商業之繁盛，甲於全省，南寗爲省會所在地，係全省政治之中心，商業亦隨之發達，其繁榮不亞於梧州，惟全省經濟勢力，大都換於粵入之手，舉例言之，梧州商店一三九三家，屬於本省開設者僅二六八家，占商店總數百分之十九，此外多爲粵省人所經營，中以蘇杭疋頭及銀錢業爲多，又如梧州之二十四家銀號，二十三家爲粵籍，另一家之裕桂，乃係桂粵合資，南寗銀號十二家，粵籍者占其大半，南寗商會主席林伯膏君，及多數委員，均爲粵人，粵商人所以在桂省特占優越之原因，則以粵人善經商，與富有冒險心，及具有歷史的地理的條件以外，要以洋貨之推廣爲最大因素，蓋廣東爲華洋通商之發源地，華洋貿易，大部分握於粵人手中，廣西以地理關係，當然爲粵商勢力所易於深入，說者謂，桂省爲一貿易入超之省，其地位正如我國之於國際市塲，梧州恍如上海，卽凡廣西內地各都市對梧州爲入超，梧州又對香港廣州爲入超，因貿易之入超，廣西對外幣之需要日多，對外省金融之勢力，自然减損，此爲一大癥結，歸途經梧州，與全省出入口貿易處，經理陳雄杜肅二君談，均以桂省目下正在力求入超之减少，希望在一二年內，變成出超之省份，此後全省金融及幣制，當然處於優越地位，而不致落人之後，復謂桂省牲畜，米穀，桐油，礦產，年來出產甚豐，極可將產量增多，則此後地方經濟，當然可以充裕，承檢賜梧州最近兩年來出入口大宗貨物量值統計表，極爲詳細，並謂每月均有詳細統計，以後並擬年出彙刋，以便檢閱，茲就二十四年份出入口統計，將原表中出口貨與入口貨各以前十位摘要如左，以供研究廣西省出入口貿易者之參考。</p>

<p>勃羅特</p>
<p>五分鐘內　連獲兩球　東華陳公與關洵安缺席、陸鍾恩客串後衛、關澢安當乙組劇戲之餘、再任門將職、周光中亦未參戰、由舒士耕代庖、因此後防空虛、幸李義臣負傷出任中鋒、前綫强勁、敵軍後顧不暇、而澢安士耕、表演昨亦賣力、擇地後、東華順風佈陣、一底盤旋後、李義臣得張金海之傳遞、舉足攻門、應聲入網、時距開賽尚不足一分鐘、旋義臣又得門下機會、以額傷未愈、不敢頭攻、致交臂失去、俄而、曹秋亭單騎前驅、正擬傳中、敵衛已猛撲營救、秋亭恐佳機再失、雙跌飛處、敵門再開、東華於五分鐘內、連獲兩球、其進展之神速、使敵人瞠目不知所措</p>
<p>四對〇結束上半時　敵軍數次猛攻、終以後防顧慮、前鋒難越中綫一步、東華亦有多次良機、平白失去、比賽陷於沉悶之局者良久、旋東華得角球機會、幼良主開、鮑萊送出未遠、秋亭在底綫勾轉、勞根接而復失、張金海略一撥動、又中紅心、不一分鐘、東華又大舉圍攻、孫錦順在入叢中穿出、鐵腿翻飛、敵門洞開、臘軍屢受挫折、猛勇反攻、左翼海却蒙華足遙射、角度奇準、幸澢安施展身手、化險爲夷、不久檸檬時屆、東華凈得四球、</p>
<p>義臣幼良　連中三元　再戰開始、臘軍更動位置、較前略形活躍、八分鐘內、各無所獲、東華旋得角球機會、各無亭主開、李義臣臥地掃射、斜均入網、淸晰美妙、堪稱绝唱、不久錦順再度攻門、勞根出迎、幼良趕上再射、敵軍又是風勢愈烈、臘軍引球攻門、均被風飄遠、不久幼良東山再起、單騎刦營、迅速無比、舉足一挑、又開紀錄、七對〇之鉅大比數、愈使東華安如磐石矣、臘軍在猛烈反攻中、球在中綫盤旋、裁判那愛脫突然銀角聲饗、義臣以爲犯規被罰、將球後送、澢安出接、球被風吹、飄逸入網、尚勷趕上營救、已屬不及、斯時臘軍乃大事反攻、鮑塞利忙裹偷射、又吿入網、未及一分鐘、臘軍中堅考克倫又中　的、東華連失三城後、前鋒諸將、奮勇迎戰、賈幼良迅如飛烏、舉足送中、義臣臥射、又切橫本入網、略一盤旋後、笛聲大鳴、東華遂以八對三大勝臘克斯、</p>
<p>東華乙敗於聖芳濟</p>

<h3>重逢蘭開夏　優游初遭敗績</h3>
<p>優游連日酣戰軍力疲憊故有此敗</p>
<p>總結果二比一此敗影響錦標甚巨</p>
<p>西聯足球會乙組聯賽優游乙對西捕乙、原定昨日下午二時在逸園球場舉行、茲因西捕隊人馬不全、臨時棄權、優游乙乃不勞獲勝、另一場甲組聯賽、優游對蘭開夏、則仍按時角逐、按兩隊交鋒此决係屬重逢、第一循環中、優游會以三對一擊敗蘭開夏、故蘭軍此决出席、人馬選來十分精銳、戰來工力悉敵、精彩異常、上半時優游會防範鬆懈、蘭軍趁隙進攻、以一球佔先、下半時優游會極力反攻、無奈天不佑人、仍吿失敗、總結果二對一、此决敗績、錦標前途、影響頗巨、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<p>優游會</p>
<p>張榮才　張容　江善敬　雲逢　　陳鎭祥　梁樹棠　許竟成　陳鎭和　許文奎　奚巧生　鐘勇森</p>
<p>蘭開夏別立琪梅　台爾　巴隆　凡理萊　霍爾　　備萊　却特衛克　　頓　台維斯　透納　衛爾理斯</p>
<p>希望黯淡　此决優游隊之受挫、西聯會當局之編排秩序、亦有致之優游會隔日戰敗臘克斯、巳精疲力盡、又遇實力强勁之蘭開夏、以逸待勞、其不敗者幾希、昨日雲逢霚表演奇劣、守禦多未盡職、是亦失敗之主因、前鋒綫散漫無覊、江善敬亦不若平日之稱職、反顧敵軍、衝殺有力、左內鋒更滿場馳奔、表演有獨到之處、內衛綫亦相當堅固、現世運足球選拔、上海方面選手、巳定後日出發、優游會主將陳鎭和張榮才梁樹棠、均將去港出席、下週之戰、又遇法商會、前途更難樂觀、故本屆錦標希望、頗爲黯淡、恐我華人無染指之希望矣、</p>
<p>敵勢囂張　胡笳聲起、兩隊列陣對壘、許文奎中原出征、陳鎮和奚巧生隨侍左右、沿路過關斬將、氣燄甚熾、盤至相當地域、陳鎮和强弩突放、終因脚頭欠準、未吿成功、敵乃乘勢來犯、凡理萊邊陲統兵、遙傳中央、却特衛克見機奔上、在十二碼處叩門、張榮才撲救不及、立遭茶毒、首吿失守、此球之入、離開賽時間僅六分鐘、敵軍得彩、聲勢赫赫、五前鋒勢若猛虎、時在優游腹地盤旋、幸張榮才高擋低攔、救出不少險球、未遭蹂躪、</p>
<p>衝殺無功　奚巧生揭旗起義、越界侵犯、從右路邊綫進攻、陳鎭和後防接應、三　五傳、已深入敵軍腹地、奚巧生拔腿射門、惜過高越成野球、許竞成東山再起、再度興兵、又被別立琪梅接住、番將凡理萊忽崛起前方、在底綫處力射、在優游門前擦過、透納趕之不及、得以保全、透納捲士重來、遙傳左路、凡理萊凑之以頭、小張身手靈敏、臥地接住揮出、許文奎得球、啣枚疾走、派司小黑炭、鎮和頭頂稍偏、坐失良機、無何前半時結束、蘭開夏以一對〇佔先、檸檬過後、易陣再决雌雄、</p>
<p>各獲一球</p>
<p>優抱前雪恥雄心、反攻甚烈、無奈　一現、敵將却特衛克從人叢中穿出、引球直衝、張容阻之未及、却特衛克提起毛腿、箭出如矢、球從右面直人網角、優游再底失陷、敵軍興高彩烈、攻勢益旺、均被張榮才拒出、許文奎奮臂躍起、轉傳小黑炭、陳鎭和在十五碼處臥地掃射、球中左角網心、扳回一球、</p>
<p>優游敗績　優游會經此鼓勵、全軍奮發、鐘勇森引導前進、陳鎭和許文奎隨後跟從、迨至相當地點、許文奎奔上一脚、蹴中網心、惜陳鎭和手臂觸球、被判罰任意球、此球即宣吿作廢、鍾勇森再接再厲、二次進攻、許文奎埋伏敵營、用頭迎球、又過高不入、此時敵將培萊、忽腿抽筋出埸、乃以十人應戰、優游正可趁勢進攻、無奈球運不濟、失却良機不少、迨培萊再進場作戰、優游更難下手、未幾、胡笳長鳴、結果爲二對一、優游以一球之差、慘遭敗北、</p>

<p>我國擊彈名家張英達、昨日下午在萬國總會、以千點比九五三戰勝丁明毅於業餘高級擊彈賽中張氏之勝、早在意料、但不期丁氏表演甚佳、在開始之初、即遭丁氏打擊、當時丁氏繼續擊出二二·三六·二一·三槍之巨數、乃以一八〇點比一一九遙占於先、乃機會一變、張氏乘勢直上、連有五二·二〇·四一·二三之巨數發生、遂超越過前居領導地位、以後益有高下、而至終局上半局五〇〇點比四一〇點、張氏占先、結果一千點比九五三點得勝、將於四月一日參加複賽、其對手卽係今日比賽之貝納爾與柏克中之勝利一人、在張丁兩氏賽之前日、尚有二幕比賽、其一麥迪那與克拉克比賽、極見緊張又兼興趣、麥氏以千點比九〇一獲勝、端頼其一槍一百二十七點、又一慕爲蘇石以一千點比五八六點、局勢則甚平淡、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳鐵吾）</p>
<p>「春花」「秋月」，在騷人們的筆下，認爲是最最可愛的東西，共實，「秋月」的可愛是永久的，「春花」的可愛則是暫時的了。當花兒盛開之際，固足給予騷人們愉快的感覺，可是轉瞬春殘，而落紅無主，「流水落花春去也」，那又是另一種酸溜溜的味道</p>
<p>「花開花落年年有，人老何能轉少年。」明乎此，在這「一刻值千全」的春夭，應該加緊努力，請記住了：「一歲之計在於春。」</p>
<p>最美麗不過的罌粟花，而所結成的果實，却是毒辣非凡；一般不惹人注目的野草閒花，一到了秋天，反會有膾炙人口的收成；「風流男子」「美貌佳人」，往往也是害人的毒物，所以「以貌取人」，是愚笨不過的事。「春夢」正酣的人們，當知驚覺吧。</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 湖帆</p>
<p>春光已悄悄地溜進了人間了。</p>
<p>江南的春，是秀媚的。伊像一幅畫，伊有着妖蕩的迷人的誘力，伊給予人們愉快與舒適。</p>
<p>那幾座秀麗的山，幾道恬靜的水，藍色的天，靑色的草浪……這一切不是詩人的詩句嗎。在秀麗的山麓中會使人忘記他的靑春，在柔意的湖水上，盪着一葉扁舟，看着早霞，欣賞着落日餘暉，此豈是利祿之徒所可憶想的夢景？「鄧尉」的「香雪海」，此時巳是梅香十里，在粉紅的大紅的純白的花叢中，誰還想得起這破碎的現實之社會？</p>
<p>「若到江南趕上春，千萬和春住。」這已成為千古之佳句了。在這淡淡的二句中，我們可以　得到如何深切的意味！</p>
<p>這幾天，春風吹吻着軟腰的楊柳，飛烏送伊春天的消息，江南的一切，都給春光擁抱住了。千萬顆靑春的心，想已沉醉在春之懷抱中吧？</p>
<h3>春柳</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>柳爲春日之绝妙點綴品，晴垂芳態，雨含輕烟，臨沼拂堤，自僥畫意，志異續編云：「木之易生者，無過於柳，凡木亦有可以校條挿土而生者，惟柳則或順挿，倒挿，橫挿，無不立生，相傳二十八宿中有柳，柳星所照，故種無不生，理或然歟。」故取尺許長之枝，深埋土中，稍露少許於地面，時時以水灌之，則必校條叢茁，於中選最强挺者留一本，一年之後，則可高至丈餘矣。</p>
<p>「元伯玉宅前挿柳，初春吐芽，曰：「且得漏春和尚一一無恙」」·見淸異錄，名稱殊僻冷·</p>
<p>明張依水病西湖無柳，似美女之無眉，孔雀之無尾；束裝北上，過血補植，谷應泰倩藍田叔畫西湖種柳圖以赠之。又左文襄於戡定新疆後，於通甘新大道上，遍植楊柳，共達三千里之長，不但爲淸代邊防建設上之殊勳，亦爲文襄生平自命得意之事業。當文襄駐節新疆時，有湘客某流落新省，困不得歸，聞左在，乃以詩干之曰：「大將西征久未還，湖湘子弟滿天山，新栽楊柳三千里，惹得春風度玉關。」左氏喜其搔着癢處，擊節稱賞，優禮而歸，皆槙柳佳話也。</p>
<p>繪事雜錄有畫柳一則云：「宋人多寫垂柳，又有點葉柳·柳不難畫，只要分枝頭得勢耳·點柳之妙，在樹頭圓舖處，只以綠汁渣出，又要蕭森有迎風搖颺之思，其校頭半明半暗·又春三月柳未垂條，秋九月柳已衰颯，俱不可混，設法亦須體此意也」·頃見我友謝君閒鷗作柳陰待渡小幅，一船娘娟媚多姿，映以嫩柳，一望血知爲陽春三月節景，洵高手已。</p>
<h3>春之情調</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>屋旁曠塲上又有許多孩子散佈着，嘻嘻哈哈在放各色各樣的紙鷂，瞧他們滿臉愉快，而毫不覺奔跑的勞苦，有的跌了一交，立刻就爬起，笑着。這是多麽活潑，蓬勃有生氣的，天眞的一羣呵。正和這春天的陽光，春天草木，一樣明媚而榮茂。我感到一種暗示了：人類原該活潑愉快，不知任何痛苦而生存着的，自然的生機决不能戕賊，破壞。</p>
<p>我們應從頽唐，愁苦，消極……的深淵中解放出來。那蔚藍的晴空，那遙長的瀝淸路，那永流不绝的泉水，那鮮艷的花朶……一切自然的產物不都爲着我們人類而存在的嗎？自然的境域中，並沒有頹唐憂鬱與消極的成份的。一切不幸，苦悶，黑暗……的產生，都由於人類主觀及情感的主使力罷了。不見那草木，如今不又櫃續了它們的生機了嗎。暫時的厄難，算得了什麽？</p>
<h3>吾家的春色</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑攝於紫羅蘭盦</p>
<p>—含苞的小桃與活躍的金魚—</p>
<p>對着白亮的春天的陽光，對着窗前那株盛開的紫蓬萊，不禁從心坎中滲出感激之深情。呼吸一口淸新的空氣，「呵，人類是幸福的·」那些不幸福的人類，在煤坑底，在戰場上，在鐵輪下，在汚溝邊……却並不歸咎於自然的，自然的景物始終平衡地對待人類，一個富翁，一個乞丐，同樣能曬到春天的陽光。一切幸與不幸，好與壞的遭際，統是人類自己分判出高低來的呵！</p>
<h3>春霧之清晨</h3>
<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>都市靜靜地浸在迷離的霧裏，濕濕的。踏着輕快的腳步走到街上，眼前像掛着一片白色的紗簾，那麼朦隴地。脚踏車的鈴聲淸脆地響過去了，人和車一瞥就消失在迷霧裹，只有橡皮愉的痕跡淸晰地印在潮濕的地上。</p>
<p>前面，不知什麽東西在隱的地閃着一紅一綠的光芒，是太陽嗎？是月亮嗎？還是小姐們身上的珠光寳氣呢？</p>
<p>凉濕的春風吹上身來，怪舒適的。我緩步走到黃浦江邊，想瞧一瞧江上的霧景。</p>
<p>籠着輕烟樣的黃浦江是靜悄悄的，沒有船隻來往沒有汽笛的呼應；望出去，在白茫茫的一片裹，祇看見沛東模糊的輪廓，軍艦商船的怪影，像一幅未完成的畫圖似的。潮水好像受不住這死樣的沉寂，發怒地冲擊岸灘，激起了一片響亮的回聲。這回聲，在冷落的江邊，寂寞的春霧裹，是顯得非常雄壯，宏亮，有力！</p>
<p>霧是偉大的，它能够使水上，陸地，空中的交通暫時停止了行動，使萬能的科學也只好對它降服！但　們需要光明的太陽，因爲它有着更偉大的力量和意義！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲恨千秋</p>
<p>俗言道得好，上有天堂，下有蘇杭。蘇州杭州是人間的福地，那是自古已爲社會上所公認的。不過杭州興蘇州的情形，多少有些分別。杭州有個西湖，遊歷的人，到了杭城，一見三竺六橋，就可以證實。蘇州就不然，他之所以爲天堂，完全在於內質方面，這種內質，不是遊歷家一到了蘇州闆門，就可以看得到的。這要住上兩三個月之後，嘗過了飲食起居的另一種滋味，然後才會知道蘇州之所以爲天堂。這種天堂風味，自然不是三言兩語可以形容得盡。倒不如用兩個字來包括着說，就是閑適。閑字是別個城市裏也可以得着的。所難得的，便是這個適字。而住在蘇州城裹的人，花了少數的錢，儘可以讓起居飲食，全適意的。這話何以見得？根據我的朋友蘭厂主人的生活，那就可以知道了。蘭厂主人，也不過是個賣文爲活的書生，由他十幾歲賣文起，直賣到四十歲爲止，居然靠他積攢下的一筆心血錢，也在蘇州城裹買下了人家一　廢園子，作了住宅。　子雖是荒蕪過了。但是經他積年累月的整理，很覺得幽雅宜人。他反正把整理園子，當了一種工作外的消遺之法，拚了工夫不算，也就花錢有限。這園子裹面，雖是各種花草，都不無點綴，最爲茂盛的，要算兩種，一種是紫羅蘭花，一種是菊花。當我去拜訪這個園子的時候，那是國歷的十月，正當菊花盛開之日，那時，我在上海作客，聽到說華北局面日非，欲歸未得，心裹是非常的難過。蘭厂聽到這個消息，他就特地到寓所裹來看我。我住的那一個小樓，寫字檯上，散亂的稿紙，和大小不齊的書本，佔了大半邊的位置。我蓬亂着隱藏了銀絲的枯燥頭髮，憔悴了的面孔，透着蒼白。我身上穿的那件靑呢袍子，雖然顏色是很深的，但是在袖子上，衣襟上，依然可以發現那斑斑點點的墨跡。蘭厂進房來了，我首先搶過去和他握手，當我握着他的手，是溫熱綿軟的時候，我自已知道我的手是冰凉的了。他脫了他的夾大衣，露出他身上的藍稠袍子，和黑毛葛馬褂，是沒有一點皺紋和痕跡。這和他那書生白面一樣，不帶一點蒼老的樣子。（一）</p>
<h3>春之一隅</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>星期日，大院落裹只聽午鷄在啼，一絲風都沒有。春天的江南眞好，太陽直凭如此溫暖。想來都市的園林裹，一定會誘惑着許多年靑人，笑着散步着。衣衫飄飄地，鬢脚下吹過花香，臉頰都染上了薄醉的嬌紅。然而我，却被扔在小小的書　的一隅，連呼吸也很困難。偶然看一看牕外的一角靑天，一點輕雲，一片亮光，我開始悔恨不會跟着妻的一羣，也向半淞園去溜澾。</p>
<p>要想和平日一樣的泡一盃清茶，燒一支捲烟，坐在籐榻上海闊天空的冥想，籍以排遣些兒近來感受到的新奇的寂寞。馬上演戲似的如此這般一做，自己蠢着眼，眼瞧着烟，烟飛入茶香裹不見了；然而我的心情還是安定不下來。我感到美麗的虹永遠存在夢裹，存在渺遠的晚晴之天；假如自己拍動金翅，翔向虹的　圍，這所謂「虹」也只是抓不到的水蒸而巳。什麼事情一到了現實，便能印證出從前幻想的謬誤。待幻想完全燬減凈盡，那生之意味也就淡薄而嘗着最深的寂寞。「寂寞」不是文字上的表現，而是內心流不出眼淚，又不敢怨恨別人的瞬間，將所受的苦悶，偷偷地獨自葬在輕微的甜笑裹的那一種情緒。</p>
<p>所以我雖想忘掉一切，裝飾成個怪瀟灑的詩人，竟不可得。倒是女僕激刺了我的心，伊說：</p>
<p>「少爺，你老是守在家裏幹嘛？」</p>
<p>「幹嘛？」我也句自己詢問。但我能夠把這精微的底蘊，訴　給女僕懂？我只搖搖頭，勉强慢慢地答：</p>
<p>「我歡喜幽靜，市上全是灰鏖哪！」</p>
<p>「灰塵？大家向市上跑，就不見窒死了誰。」女僕笑着走了。</p>
<p>的確，蠢在家裹，還不是有着比灰塵更悶人的空氣，鎖住了自己的心！而况太陽灼上了花磚，全身被着舒服的春之氣息，四肢有些軟癢，旣然無法也得去找找友人，談天說地，或者可以拾些春的風光。要是友人在家，就請他們上公園去也很好，要是友人和他的妻都沒有閒暇，單單拉着伊的女孩子去也可以；總比一個人踽踽凉凉的獨步要熱鬧多呀。萬一他們都不願出來，那羼入他們的溫暖的家庭裏，隨便胡謅，讓消磨去幾個鐘頭，不是勝於枯坐在家裏好多嗎？</p>
<p>於是走向臥房，悄悄地巡視一周，先替妻的粉盒蓋好，換下的冬季大衣叫女僕拿上晒台然後鎖了房門，戴一頂便帽溜向市上去。多天不見的太陽，在速日陰雨後放出，格外有光輝，有熱力，恰如要洗滌我的一雙乾涸的眸子。</p>
<p>曲曲灣灣轉多許多衙衕，雖說在人叢中穿過，而我的心總是冷凍的。一瞧友人的住宅，矗立眼前，才生了些勇氣，伸手撳了撳電鈴，站在台堦上靜候門內的人聲。等了好久好久，並無回音。看看斜倒在台堦上的自己的人影，這樣瘦削，這樣凝靜，倒愀然地有些凄淸孤寂的感想。</p>
<p>開門的是車夫阿二，他吿訴我友人的全家，早晨都上龍華看桃花去了。這使我創傷的神經上，猛然地又中了一箭，我還有什麼氣力再　　在街頭，讓一隊一隊遊春的人們譏笑？只得嗒然地重循原路，回到家裹。</p>
<p>依然大院落裹啼着鷄聲，陽光很白亮的流進我的書齋。空虛的心正像空虛的全個院落一樣</p>
<h3>春頌</h3>
<p>是春天了。</p>
<p>靜靜地站在窗前，陽光鮮艷地照在臉上，似乎向我說：『是春天了』！</p>
<p>生活在這地獄似的都市裏，飛快地是十個年頭了，也就過了十個春天啦！可是，在上海我似乎不曾過過春天，四季彷彿沒有什麼差別。如其，若有的話，那便只有在紳士淑女的衣服上，去細細的領味。</p>
<p>春，畢竟是一位美麗的女郎。伊那嬌艷的靑春，似一朶灼熱的火花的光燄在和煦的南風裹照耀。</p>
<p>惟其春姑娘是太美麗太有情了，所以姑娘有時亦會墮落下來；惟其春姑娘是太灼熱太活潑了，所以有時也會失戀呢！</p>
<p>眞的，現在是春天了。</p>
<p>春風，春光，春色，春香，巳散滿了整個的宇宙。枯寂了整冬的人間，漸漸兒回復了融融的生氣，但願幸福的人們永永地陶醉在春姑娘的懷抱裹吧！</p>

<h3>國際資本市場之檢討</h3>
<p>— 劉孔鈞</p>
<p>國際資本市場“The　International　Capital　Market”與國際金融市場“The　International　Money　Market”關係密切，性質上殊難加以區別。資本交易如外國貸欵或外國直接投資，其影響及於貸欵國家，與貨物之輸出相同：借欵國家所受之影響，則與貨物之輸入相同。長期貸欵成立後，短期資金置於借主處分之下，其所能提取之狀態，與他項短期資金，亦無以異也。就他方面言之，金融市場之短期交易，常爲長期貸欵之先容；債權人往往希望債務人他日成立長期貸欵，或出售證券於資本市場，以資償還也。雖然，二者之功用不同，其機構亦後各自獨立。余融市場之仟務，爲投資短期交易，及便利國際短期資金之移動；資本市埸之任務，則爲投資長期交易，及便宜國際長期資本之移動。</p>
<p>國際資本市場之交易，可分　種：　外國新債券之發行；　舊債券在各國投資家手中之移轉，或重新分配。就表面觀之，國際資本市場之資金，常自富庶國流入窮乏國，論者多以此爲資本市場與金融市場之绝大異點，此說似是而實非也。益當外國新債券發行之際，資金固由富庶國流入窮乏國。但舊債券之流通移轉，其方向恒得其反，窮乏國居民爲圖安全及貨殖起見，頗多購置富庶國發行之債券。而其原因由於恐懼貨幣貶值，或意圖避免苛稅，以致發生資本逃亡，羣趨於外國債券之投資者，亦所在多有。希臘烏拉圭等國人民之購買英美荷蘭所發行之債券，乃其著例也。</p>
<p>債務國支付債欵之本息，爲資本由債務國流入債權國之第二原因。此項資金常以之購買他處證券，而保留於資本市場。此外則國際證券　利交易，亦足促證券之繼續移動。和新債券之發行，代表資本之單方流動；而國際資本市塲之其他交易，常爲資本變方之流動也。</p>
<p>國際金融市塲，爲國際經濟正當關係之要緊，此爲舉世所公認者。國際資本市場則恒受世人之嚴格批評，與國會嚴密調查焉。因此各國政府近數年來，對於資本市場訂定直接或間接之條例以限制之。例如美國政府向不干涉對蘇俄之短期貸欵，今則蘇俄證券之在美國發　者，均在禁止之列矣。然蘇俄短期貸欵，多用於購買資本貨物之需，長短期徒有其名，經濟上殊難於劃分也。</p>
<p>國際資本市場之受世人嚴格批評，其理由不難想象得之。益短期外國貸欵，大都爲銀行所經營，其損失係銀行　間接之銀行股東或存戶所負擔。銀行失敗，其他位並不變更，因銀行之經營國際貸欵，多爲大規模堅固之組織，其失敗固甚　也。長期貸欵，則其資金由於債券之發行，多數持票人，實爲其主宰。倘因債務不履行，或證券市價慘跌，而蒙損失，負擔者爲證券之持票人，而非發行之機關也。此外則政治關係，亦爲政府管理外國證券發行之重要原因。</p>
<p>雖然，國際資本市塲與世界經濟發達之關係，其重要不亞於國際金融市塲與國際貨物勞務移動之關係也。使無國際資本之幫助，則經濟進展遲緩，若干區域必不能如今日之發達矣。疇昔之時，幾無國不需外國長期資本，今日之情形，迄未稍變。考英國實業與貿易之發達，多得力於荷蘭之資本，而英國則復供給資本，以發展歐洲大陸諸國之經濟。十九世紀美國經濟之發達，則有賴於英國及歐陸諸國資本之流入，近日美國資本。則以之爲發展南美遠東及歐洲諸國實業之用也。</p>
<p>歷史所昭示於吾人者，各國長期資本之流動，發生不少惡例：如管理不當，逾量借欵，濫用欵項，官吏納賄等派弊。此等事件之在國際，與在國內，會無以異。觀於　時美人所感鐵路與地產公司失敗之苦痛經騐，較之外國投資失敗，有過之無不及，可以知之矣。</p>
<p>新進國家經濟之啓發，與農業國家之工業化，其投資方法，不外　賴本國富源與利用外資二途。前者之進步異常迂緩，阿比西尼亞屬之。即就阿國言，其經濟進展，如鐵路事業，亦多得力于外資。次則蘇俄在共產政府統治之下，亦以本國富源爲發展實業之用，此項政策足以促國內消費力之减退，因貨物之能覓得國外銷路者，無不儘量出口，以謀易得資本貨物也。反之，加那大德意志之實業發達，一日千里，而其國民之生活程度，絲毫不感窘迫，則以其能收利用外資之實效也。</p>
<p>一國亦發展天然富源與實業過程中所生之影饗，不惟及于本國巳也，亦且及于他國。蓋利用大規模之外資，常使進口貨超過出口貨，易言之，借欵國之消費，勢必在生產額之上，此項消費，足以促出口國實業之繁榮。且天然當源開發後，生產增加，生活程度改善，出口亦必因之發達，其盈餘可用于外國資本本息之支付，而提高他國之生活程度也。他方面當國家以全部或大部本國之力啓發富源或實業時，必要資本之儲蓄，常引起國內消費力减退，及强迫出口，而銷售國將感受不利之影響。世人皆知蘇俄輸出小麥，牛乳，及他種本國需要之消費貨物于國外，以易得外匯，作購買資本貨物之用。此項强迫出口，不惟减退俄國之生活程度，亦且足以擾亂他國之貨物市場與世界之物價，故國際資本市場移轉一國之資本于他國，旣可助長世界經濟之發達，又可防止他國以國際傾銷政策啟發本國之富源也。</p>
<p>國際資本流動之結果，至政治經濟發生變化，流動因而停止時，而益爲顯著。當是時也，國家之依賴外資流入，而每年支付鉅大之債務本息者，不得不設法减少輸入，謀輸出之增加。德國自一九三〇年之秋，國際資本流入停止後，不得已以本國富源，支付對外債務，馴至輸入减少，乃採取　種方法，以增加輸出，此種趨勢，使他國爲自衛計，亦抵制德貨之輸入，于是乎德國對于外債，祇有出于不履行之一途矣。</p>
<p>有節制之國際資本流動，固租于借貸雙方國家，但流動若爲逾分激進，則其結果適相反。故若干國家限制資本輸出，不得超過國際收支之贏餘數，以免危及本國之貨幣及銀行制度也。今如美國在某年國際收支之贏餘數爲五億美元，其適當辦法，惟有將該欵安全投資國外，以應經濟上之需要；吾則外國迫不得已，將採取抵制美之貨物及勞務，或運送現金至美，或不履行對美之債務矣。</p>
<p>若一國輸出資本超過國外應得之收益，則其貨幣與銀行制度勢將感受危險。此項惰况之發生，蓋因利用外國短期資金于　期外國貸欵，短期資余隨時發生提取情事，而長期貸欵則不能收回也。至大宗外國證券，更不易在外國市場自由處分，即能勉强處分，其不致市價之慘跌也幾希，英國一九三一年之放棄金本位，其前車也。</p>
<p>逾量貸欵之不良影響如彼，須知逾量借欵亦足使債務國發生困難地位，而不能履行其債務。就理論上言之，任何國家，皆能吸收無限量之資本，以供各種事業之用，經濟與非經濟所不問也。然爲避免不履行計，其借欵限量須視其在經濟情形發生不利時，有償還能力方可。（未完）</p>
<h3>電話加價與商品經濟原則的破壞</h3>
<p>— 吳小雨</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>我們常聽到爲了利潤而限制商品生產的事實，但未會見過爲了利潤而限制商品使用的花樣。同樣，限制機器和設備的運用，在生產相對過剩時是常有的，而限制商品使用價值的實現，道種事情却是很希奇的。然而這種希奇的事，現在竟見於中國了。上海電話公司限制電話用戶的使用電話，便是一樁希奇的事。其限制電話使用的方式是：住宅每月只准叫話一百次，商店每月只准叫話一百五十次，逾額每次征金三分。</p>
<p>我們知道電話是一種公用事葉的商品，用戶裝置電話，每月織納了一定額的費用。限制叫話，是變相加價，更是限制商品之使用價值的實現。</p>
<p>列强在華經濟侵略，往往帶有超經濟略取的姿勢。道種超經濟的略取，在經濟恐慌時尤爲顯著。其事例，實不勝枚舉，而現在的需話使用的限制，實在是一個新穎的例子。這一事件表示着列强在華企業之新的進攻與壓迫。於此，不但可證明列强扶值中國封建的勢力，阻滯中國經濟的發展，使中國經濟永遠沉淪於半殖民地及至殖民地的境况；並且可證明列强在華經濟勢力本身，亦在加緊運用封建的超經濟的略取手段了。</p>
<p>我們不要以爲常此上海經濟極度裹洛時，電話加價是忘了會增加上海之蕭條的。我們要知道這正因爲上海經濟的萎頓，電話公司得不到特殊巨大的利潤，於是便以額外收費的方法，來擴大其額外收益。我們也不要看錯上海特區電話用戶一九三五年特別减少，而電話變相加價，是沒有顧到這一事實；我們要知道正因用戶的减少，正因當此市面凋敝時電話商無法推廣其營業，擴大其利潤，於是乃採用此種新的辦法，來增加必需裝置電話者的負担，滿足電話商的欲壑，轉嫁蕭條的禍害。這種新的辦法，雖然將爲電話用戶更將减少的原因，但亦是用戶式微的結果。總之，這是在上海如此蕭倐的局面之下，電話商一種保持乃至提高利潤的特殊企圖與方法。這是資本之一般的面目，不過在中國表現得更爲可怕了。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>上海電話公司近年收入，並沒有减少，而改弦　張，變相加價，以提高其收益，這由資本之立塲觀之，尋求增殖乃至額外收獲，原是資本的「英雄」本色，是不足怪。只是由商品經濟原則觀之，這是有點反乎這一原則的。試爲約略解剖如下。</p>
<p>我們知道，所謂商品，「首先卽是一種外在的物件，其質料使其能够由某一方面滿足人們的需要」（註一）。換言之，不能滿足人們的需要的，不能成其爲商品：而由此類推，購買之後，不能盡量提供其効用的，亦不足爲商品。商品價値，原爲二重性：使用價值，興交換價值，而交換價值又爲價值的現象形態。無交換價值固無價值，但使用價值賢爲構成交換價值的要素（註二），故交換價值依仗於使用價值，而使用價值又「只有在使用或銷費中才能實現」（註三）。因此，歸根到底，商品的價值，最後還須依賴商品的使用來實現。換言之，購買一種商品而不能自由享受其使用價値，這在商品交換上是一個自相矛盾，而興商品經的基本規律相違背的。</p>
<p>電話的價値，自電話公司言之，存在於用戶每月所納的費用上面，亦即存在於交換價值上面。在用戶言之，電話的價值，存在於電話的自由使用上面。惟有這樣，電話公司才得實現其交換價值，而用戶才得實現其使用價值。亦惟有這樣，電話用戶所購用的電話，方能實現其爲使用價值，方能達其裝置電話的初衷。倘若用戶裝置電話，每月已繳納一定金額，而在電話使用上仍須受到限制，逾限須繳額外話金，則自常識言之，這是疊床架屋的苛求，而從經濟原理看，這更是違背商品經濟之原則的：在商品經過交換過程之後，原商品主應一任買主自由寳現其使用價值。即是說，電話用戶已納過月費，便有自由享受使用電話之權利。賣主不能限制買主對貨物實現其使用價値，正跟買中不能干涉賣主如何處置其由賣貨所得的交換價值一樣。明言之，電話公司之不能限制已納月費的電話用戶之使用電話，正跟用戶不能干涉公司如何運用所收的电話費一樣。</p>
<p>爲明瞭計，我們可打一個更爲淺鮮的比仿。假設我們買了一枝筆或一雙鞋。購買時已付出或已允付一定的代價。然而如果買加以後，原商品中還要限制筆或鞋的使用：於筆，每日限制寫一千字，逾此則額外收費；於鞋，每日限制走一里路，途此則亦額外徵金。那麽，試問這是不是商品經濟場合下一個巨大的笑話，或奇事？試問這是不是破壤了商品經濟的原則</p>
<p>這一比仿。與叫用電話逾限收費相較，本質上原無以異。</p>
<p>老實說一句，限制電話的使用，更是限制這一商品之使用價值的實現。使用價值旣不易實現，則其交換價值亦不易實現，因為將見很少人肯裝置此種電話。</p>
<p>三，</p>
<p>電話限制使用，除　超經濟的略取用戶這一點而外，並且還使商品本身得不到充分發揮其效能的機會。電話是一種機器，正同其他任何機器或工具一樣，是應當隨需要而極盡其效能的。惟有如此，才能够盡量提供其「經濟」的價值。倘若封鎖不用，則豈不成了「　餅」，又怎能够盡其爲「日常生活的器具？且豈不人爲的毀滅了這」器具的经濟價值？這在人類，豈不是「暴殄天物」？故電話限制使用，由這一點觀之，又是背違了物必盡量求得其妙用之經濟原則的。</p>
<p>且無論從用戶電話機或公司設備觀察，叫話次數爲多爲少，除　榜話　　而外，於其他方面是不會有什麼損益的。如果真要談到損益，則電話機器和其他相關的設備，置而不用，或少用，倒是會受到更大的損壞（機器擱置不用而受損，道已經是一個常識了）。</p>
<p>現在電話公司限制用戶的叫話，企圖藉以增大公司的利潤，這與巴西的傾倒咖啡於海，和美國的剷毀棉麥（註四），其爲保持乃至提高利潤的目的則一，然其性質與方式却相差甚遠了。在傾倒咖啡與剷毀棉麥的場合，是由於咖啡與棉麥生產的相對過剩，故减產毀成，尚不失其爲　本制經濟「本色」的特徵，且正係由於缺乏使用，或消費之故。今上海電話公司爲了利潤，不出之打毀電話機器（當然不會，因爲這裹是沒有過剩可言的），而出之限制電話用戶的叫話，這是限制商品之使用或銷費的。其用意和手段的嚴酷，豈不超過了巴西的咖啡商與美國的棉麥主嗎？毀咖啡與剷棉麥，乃是由於該項物產之相對過剩，而上海電話公司限制電話的使用，却並非爲了用戶叫話次數過多，而是爲了要採取一種特殊手段，以增大利潤。這也是資本略取的一種別開生面的辦法吧。</p>
<p>電話限制使用，其所引起的商業蕭條之加重，與一般電話用戶之額外痛苦，是一言難盡的。上海整個社會經濟的活動所受到的影響，當然更非淺鮮。復次，電話按次計費，其所引起的計算差誤，乃至憑空揑造與張冠李戴之糾紛。一定會是很多。在電話商，自可由此獲得一筆額外之額外的收人，然在用戶方面，却益不堪其擔負了。</p>
<p>而且此種限制電話使用的辦法，將引起用戶的狂减，其於電話公司營業，亦會反而有害的。</p>
<p>總之，由電話限制使用這一事件，我們更可見到外商之視中國爲如何物，而「予取予求」，毫不顧銷費者的痛苦了。</p>
<p>以上，主要是就純經濟的立場視察的。此外種種方面，當然還很多，不過本篇不擬加以叙述了。</p>

<h3>從工廠的立場上論减低利率</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>金融界放欵工商業的减低利率問題，一致認爲窒礙難行，其維一的理由，可分爲：</p>
<p>（甲）公債利率仍在一分左右，</p>
<p>（乙）中央國家銀行無低利放欵同業的準備，</p>
<p>（丙）不能制止存戶資金之逃避，</p>
<p>（丁）利率的高低，視市場經濟供求情形而定，不能出之於人爲的抑低，</p>
<p>還有多數經濟學者，認為利率的高低，尙無關緊要，最重要的，是出了高利率，能不能得到資金融通的問題：道樣論斷，誠然有理由的：筆者站在工厰的立場上，來討論减低利率問題與產　界之關係，闡明利率的减低，生，死，存，亡，實有互相維繫的因素，遲早總應該實行的：</p>
<p>吾們知道：中國没有民族工業的大資本家，即使有錢的富商鉅賈，誰肯集合起來，作胃險的投資工廠，任勞仟怨，脚踏實地的去做實業家呢？地並未想到民族輕工業，如紡織廠等，我不自辦，四萬五千萬人的衣被所需，仰給舶來，終有資金流完，吃盡當光的一天！那是何等危險的事！惟其如此，鳳毛麟角的少數的實業家，外感强鄰經濟侵略，傾銷政策的壓迫！內受農村經濟衰落的影響－而數十萬人的工友生活，又不能不予維持，（工友直接和間接的，恐還不止數十萬人），向金融界做貨物押欵得來的資金，又受著高利率的剝削，和此以往，實業家的呻吟痛苦！實有　類？交金融界不放遠目光，作低利貸疑的融通，實業家爲銀行，錢莊，忙利息而自已不克維持，一且陷於總崩潰的時候，我想銀行，錢莊，和存戶，决不能巍然獨存！或有人說，你祇是片而的論調，金融業也有環境的困難！對於工廠管理方面的是否精密，節省，是門外漢，所以不敢减低利率，更不敢大　放欵。然而產業家的生產成本，因利息高而加重，不易推銷，忍痛推銷，必幫虧本，這是事實。一方面資金呆積在銀行庫裏，或濫做金子，物品，公債……的投機生意，却畸形的發展而熱鬧！倒果爲因，前途危險，有不堪設想者，這也是事實，而母庸掩飾者。</p>
<p>夫紡識工廠之需數百萬元，在歐西各邦，是極平常的事。日本紡織廠之極度發達，亦以棉紗成本中，無利息一項，而我國紗廠，紗錠在十萬以上者甚少。棉紗一包（二十支標準）利息的負擔，多則十餘元，少亦六七元，市價與成本，距離往往背道而馳！照成本出售，又豈爲事實環境所許？華紗之不能與日紗競銷者以此！我華商紗廠，如以五萬紗錠計，將地基，房屋，機器抵借押欵興貨物營運借欵，最低以國幣二、五〇〇、〇〇〇元論，統扯月息利率九五％，利上滾利，年需耗費三十餘萬元。即使盈餘能相抵，實業家已是白忙！更安有發展事業之餘地？因利息擔負重而虧耗的，比比皆是，與其焦頭爛額！母寗曲突徙薪！我希望政府當局，以國家銀行的力量，低利貸疑給金融業轉放給工廠，或者直接貸放！同時以行政的手腕，法律的釐訂，先規定一酌中的利率，嚴禁高利率，希望達到營運借欵，在月息七厘，其他抵押借欵在月息六厘之間，以嘉惠於工商業，相互維繫！</p>

<p>患者余瑰女士，年二十四，學界。病歷——身素柔弱，怕勞畏動，時發乾咳。病狀—氣息促迫，稍動即喘息心悸，欽劇則頭昏眼花；晨起痰稠，日哺煩熱。四載以還，襄憊萬分！月經不調，失眠肢軟。迭藥不瘳，以爲莫治。前冬始經同學王女士介紹來所求治。處方—診斷兩肺尖均有結核病灶，非尋常製劑所能奏效，即嚴囑購服德國『補肺拿爾』根除頭欬，淸痰補肺；同時令服德國『補女容』以調整經期，而愈失眠。未三星期，果獲良效，夜臥酣適，精神奮發。乃嗕其續服二星期勿斷，以望根治。日前與其在先施公司相遇，見其健美勝前，幾判若兩人。據謂愈後年餘，身强腦健，學業鋭進云。</p>
<h3>血痰遺精霍然並救</h3>
<p>患者賴裕民君，年三十三，商界。病歷—氣血虧損；婚後又傷房勞。病狀—欽嗆咯血，痰唾白膩，胸部隱痛，食慾不振，遺精陽萎，心煩失眠，身虧體憊。因循七載，服藥殆遍，終無起色。去春始自來所投治。處方—檢查癆已至二期，非服特效劑莫愈；即囑服『補肺拿雨』，約服兩盒，血痰頓失，食增欬減；同時兼服德國『補體康』，失眠吿痊，遺精亦愈。爲期匝月，多年癆患，於茲盡去！昨得其來書，謂愈後體重增四十二磅，腎部强大，腰膝有力，迭至醫院檢痰，毫無癆菌發現，X光檢查，證明患部增生結締組織，確已根治云。</p>
<h3>治淋之最新學理</h3>
<p>違背此原則即無根治可能</p>
<p>吾人體內之防病免疫功能，爲含有機能性類脂汁之Lipoid，此實最要之抗毒素，若受有疾病傳染，則此種液體遞减，而使病勢蔓延，淋病因菌毒頑强，固非舊來單純之「透膜殺菌」所能濟事，徵諸年久患者遍服各藥而僅收效一時者，其理甚明！德國醫學專家乃於迭次敗失之下，根據新學理潛心研究，對於治淋乃獲有眞確把握，而由畢德（Biedel）博士總其大成，於是淋病聖藥「克淋儂」之發明遂吿成功！按此藥成分，係由非病原菌在特殊操作下，抽出感應性蛋白體，與膽汁中之Lipoid並動植物之含有脂肪體液複製劑，實最有效之非特異性刺戟療法Vngpezi　Fische　Reizherapie名變質治療Vmstimmung．Stherdopie，從此淋病治療上開一新境地。服後即可賦活細胞，昂進機能，使血液中免疫體增進，並增加白血球，發生强一大喰菌作用。故藥量最多不過四五瓶，即能淋一消濁止，終身免疫，而無復發之膚！是以自「一克淋儂」盛行以來，歐西各國，男女患淋病者已减少百分之八十七矣！</p>
<h3>性神經與生殖力問題</h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>吾人兩性生殖力之强弱，恒視性神經之健全與否爲斷，因有性神經之健全，始可望生殖力之旺盛也。惟兩性每多於發育時代，缺乏性知識，被外界引誘，墮入手淫惡癖之岐途，致性能受傷，生殖力减削，其顯著症狀爲發育不全，遺洩，滑精，勃起力不堅，女子爲月經乖常，生殖器發育畸形，白帶下等，並因此而起惹久婚不孕，頭痛失眠，腰背酸痛，脚軟無力等症。</p>
<p>德梅國倫博士，鑒於普天之下，靑年男女之受此痛苦，乃發明以雄性動物荷爾蒙，製成「補體康」，女性動物荷爾蒙，製成「補女容」，此項動物皆用科學方法飼養，待其一到靑春期時，提取其睪丸與卵巢中之荷爾蒙，以科學方法製成之，故效力渾厚，服之能於數星期內，將生殖系之各組織，重新改造，性神經亦因此而趨於强健，一切發育不全，月經病等，皆爲之掃除，不僅生殖力强化，即早衰易老等，亦能喚回靑春健康之美云。</p>
<h3>德國『克淋儂』　克服各種淋病</h3>
<p>— 盛在强</p>
<p>（一）多年關節炎獲愈</p>
<p>患者梅春樹君，年三十三歲，患淋病已十年，變成關節炎者，亦且四年矣。平日關節周轉不靈，且殊疼痛會服各種祛濕止痛治淋之藥無效。乃丐余治療，余見共關節浮腫，尿液溷濁，且微有溫度，非亟去共炎症不可，隨即投以「克淋儂」，以殺菌除炎定痛，梅君連服四星期後，即見腫退炎消，全身關節仲屈自如，尿液瑩潔，更服「克淋儂」二瓶，未服完即告根治。嗣因其夫人亦被傳染，白帶淋漓，陰道刺痛，亦經余介紹內服「克淋儂」，復以「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，栓塞陰部，亦於四星期治愈云。</p>
<p>（二）　膿血迸流</p>
<p>患者戚致中君，年廿三歲，罹淋病一星期後，即來我處醫治，見其龜頭龐大，包皮翻轉，排尿濇痛，尿中混有膿血，戚君痛苦不堪，此極盛期之淋病也。乃爲之洗滌尿道，並囑服「克淋儂」，使炎症從內消失，一星期後，即見腫退痛止，放尿輕快，且尿液漸見澄淸，故未二星期，全部淋菌，即吿肅淸，經用血淸檢騐，毫無淋毒性反應，此良由「克淋儂」效力之正確，故奏效有若斯之速，莫怪風行歐美各國，而吾國近亦償用也。</p>
<h3>痰飲根治法</h3>
<p>— 戴德</p>
<p>氣管枝炎症，俗謂之痰飲；老年患者最多，亦恒有傷風咳嗽而來。爲誘發肺炎及肺結核之主因。余臨床實騐，惟投用德國「補肺拿爾」，僅四五瓶即吿根治，殊屬少見之療肺效藥，本品不但善治傷風及小兒百日咳，且因含有鱉魚熊鹿之肝肺脾等臟器荷爾蒙，補虛培元，防治一二三各期肺癆，卓著偉效。並因係蛋黃素複製劑，煙客咳痰及戒癮用之，尤爲無上良藥，若作常年補品，防癆却疾，健胃强身，分外精神。</p>
<h3>又一靑年脫離濁海</h3>
<p>— 曾克文君來稿</p>
<p>年少誤交劣友，致染淋病，隱諱遷延，病變更多！濫服各藥，卒難根治。放尿困難，每晨封口，便後精濁點滴。前春忽週身骨節酸疼，艱於屈伸，關膝腫赤，寸步難移，咸謂淋毒入骨，勢成殘廢。羸弱日甚！幸經友人高偉君介紹，投姚菊巖醫師處診治，經用X線治療一星期，疼痛頓减，大有起色。姚醫師亟改用德國最新發明抗淋血淸，爲余施治，約三星期，竟收全功；關節平復，轉動自如，雖登樓行遠，毫無異感。自此根治，工作操勞，至今兩年未發，重復壯健。特懇賜貴刊一角，代爲表揚，俾同病知所問津，而良醫之功可垂不朽焉。</p>
<h3>婦女隱病</h3>
<p>— 金月仁</p>
<p>所謂婦女隱病，白帶實可爲其代表，此病多由房事與自瀆，以及不潔之性交而來，患者恒覺精神沈鬱，局部白垢不绝，因而腐爛紅腫，往往因此而釀成不孕，夫婦勃谿。但患者多羞於啓齒，不肯吿人，遂使長此忍受痛苦。余於臨床上，恒償用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，因此藥能殺菌與澄淸分泌腺之機能，復能在破粘膜上予以迅速之治愈，其因淋病而致白帶者，可同時內服「克淋儂」，皆能於短期內治愈，照常成孕。用法簡便，每個婦女白帶病，均能自療，毫無流弊也。</p>
<h3>問病信箱</h3>
<p>本刋特約專家，分別解答肺病，胃病，婦女病，花柳病，性病等；來函不願發表，請附足回信郵票，寄上海武定路八六九號　康健醫藥社</p>
<p>體弱淋病</p>
<p>蕭仲文問：敝人年廿二，早年手淫，致患遺精，戒後病亦隨愈，詎又涉足花坊，遂染淋毒，而遺精復發，故身體異常孱弱，現淋病未愈，右睪丸作痛小便溷濁，何藥能使身體强壯，淋病治愈。</p>
<p>答…淋病則已成副睾丸炎，最好請姚菊嚴醫師行血淸療法，但在未治前可服「克淋儂」，至遺精體弱，可服德國「補體康」，自能迅速根木治愈。</p>
<p>停經不姙</p>
<p>陳達存問：內子經水素來不調，近因子殤體益弱，以致月經閉绝，惟白帶甚多，且陰道中時有痒感，請問何藥能使經通帶绝。</p>
<p>答…月經停止，顯爲卵巢機能低下結果，可服「補女容」，其白帶下，則務須用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」二藥可同時服用，始能根本治愈。</p>
<p>胃病咳嗽</p>
<p>張素雄問：敝人廿五歲，自前年患胃病未愈，繼又傷風，喉頭氣悶，呼吸不靈，咳嗽頻頻，痰出甚多，請問有何治法。</p>
<p>答…胃病宜服「强胃精」，至傷風咳嗽，容易成癆，速服「補肺拿爾」，庶免險化。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病臨床報告</h3>
<p>診所：四山路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>容易復發之攝護腺炎</p>
<p>淋病之容易復發，無有過於慢性攝獲腺炎，因此病尿質並不十分變異，依然清徹而透明，其中淋系，必須編徵鏡檢查，而肉眼則完全不能認識，故患者恒以為此病已愈，於是遇飲酒，房事，過度勞動等機會時，即突然復發，旋又平靜，如是往復發作，騙致難以救療。</p>
<p>其尤為危險者，即此病表面上，似無病象，故往往於無意中傳染其妻子，據余平日調查，幾於百分之九十八九，皆釀成此種惡果。如單治原患者，縱使斷根，旋又因房事而重新傳染。故余之根治療法，每令其夫婦同時醫治，輙獲永久之根治，如王百益君，罹淋毒攝護腺炎六年，曾經根治三次，旋又復發，後始乞余為其細之診療，知其夫人白帶甚多，陰門赤爛，王君殆未注意於此也。乃為之用X線及電氣療法，內服『克淋濃』，復囑其夫人亦內服『克淋濃』，外用『卡而雪地氏陰道片』，帶歸自家治療，經過三星期，王君之病，旣去十分之七八，其夫人之白帶，亦大為減少，陰門炎症已去，夫婦二人療五星期，六年以來未能徹底根治之淋病，竟完全根治，至今二年餘，從來復發。且王君去歲已逝新獲一子云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>本市逃租風張</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>前日報載：「近因社會不景氣，失業者較前更多，拖欠房租者，比比皆是，更有畏想天開，略備資斧，租賃房屋爲二房東，除自住一小間外，大部份分租他人，收入租金，盡入私囊，大房東處，則一味敷衍，迨拖至五六月後，卽遺棄破舊什物，逃之夭天，另住他處，再使用同樣技倆，若輩常一再而三，視爲生財大道，致市上逃租之風，頗爲囂張。」</p>
<p>「逃租之風」是不是因若輩一再而三的使用同樣技倆而囂張的呢？顯然是不是這樣的。我們與其說　租之風由若輩狡猾的技倆所使然，毋寗說逃租之風是根本由於社會的不景氣所使然的。</p>
<p>住在上海的人，大家都有這一感覺，那就是：把自己月所得者三分之一或甚至二分之一化在「住的問題」上，所剩下的要分配在「食」，「衣」，如有老婆兒女的尚要分配一些在兒女的「敎育費」上，那只要吾人一閉眼，就可想見其情景之悽慘了。一個賺二十元左右的薪水的男子，事實上，他是一頭牛馬呵！</p>
<p>不可吾認，那種使用牛財之道的技倆的「若輩」在這所謂不景氣的社會中，絕對不可說沒有，然而這究竟是極其微小的一小部分，逃程之風是不能由若輩所能掀起的，掀起逃租之風的根本就是這不景氣的社會，一個二房東，他所以要出了押租租賃一間房子，（押租有時是非常巨大的！）共目的就在把那一小間房子來轉租與人，他自己住的一小間可以不出房金，或甚至他依持房子還可賺錢哩。然而年來市面的不景氣，二房東的那個「好夢」已「不常」而瀕於泡化了。我們只耍看看上海每條街上的弄口貼滿了紅紅的一方塊一方塊的「召租」，就可見二房東之苦悶了。依照供求法則，多則價格跌，空房子多，當然「租金」相反地狂跌下來了。二房東本想設法把「餘屋分租」而自己可以不出錢，而現在却不得小自掏「肉里錢」了。然而二房東那可比大房東，二房東幾個月房子一空起，就在大房東處空下幾個月房金來了，這只要再來一下子「空房子一，大房東的律師信就放有你的眼前了。於是二房東寗願拋棄了自己殘破的家具，悄悄地逃跑了。所謂「逃租之風」是由是而起的！</p>
<h3>馬鞍山下的故事</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>阿興慢慢地向後退，被墻壁擋住了。想溜走却是有一枝旱烟架在頭頸上。門外漸漸地探進人來，執着鋤頭的，鐵犁的，那些人的面孔都和湯老頭一樣绷緊着，有一次不小的事變阿興是估計得到的。他兩腿一軟，跪了下來，央求着：</p>
<p>「大家聽着，這事情不是我阿興做的，你們放我走，我去求張財主，桃三哥包可以放回來……</p>
<p>湯老頭把旱烟袋一收，阿興抱着頭溜了出來，但是背樑上已着了幾下，他顧不得疼痛向田岸上跑去了。</p>
<p>那些漢子勝利地笑了。一陣風吹過馬鞍山下。布穀鳥帶來了輕快的「家家佈穀」。</p>
<h3>鐵輪</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>在城裏一條高低不平的石子街上，春天的艷陽亦那樣明媚地灑着，但沒有花香興髪影，遊春的人是走不到這兒的，祗有小店鋪裹的夥計淸閒地伏在積着灰塵的櫃上，懶軟而欲打瞌睡的模樣兒。來往的路人那般稀少，西邊風箱作塲裏停着工，沒有釘板的聲響，是這樣寂寞的街呵。</p>
<p>在春之寂寞中，却衝來一陣鐵輪輾在石子上的聲響，不知是被重腰的石子的呌嘯？還是堅硬的鐵輪的威吼？或者是石與鐵相互爭鬥的呼號，交響。總之，靜寂的艷陽似被震顫，懶倦的店夥被驚走了白夫之夢，而連一粒櫃上的灰砂，都因之不安定地跳動起來了。</p>
<p>來的是一輛笨重的榻車，高高的裝載着十幾大籮煤塊。媒塊是黑色，拉楊車小工的臉亦是黑色，在他們脚底下，果然是明媚的艷陽，而在他面前及背後，却跟隨着和煤一般黑色的命運。粗粗的火麻繩扔在他們每個肩頭上，要切進肌肉去似的。沉重，沉重，『哼哼』地透着氣，喘息，呼號着，他們挽動着鐵輪，旋轉，旋轉，爲着生活。他們的生活繫縛在鐵輪上，他們的命運跟着鐵輪在轉動，是不可以停息的，一天又一天，一年又一年……</p>
<p>『喂，使點勁兒呀，你瞧太陽……可還有三車要拖！』擋車槓的小工發急地催促着在前面的四個小工，額角上冒着黑汗珠，兩條腿忽東忽西，隨着車子的動向。在前面的小工額上亦冒着黑汗，腦袋向前衝，腰灣着，八條腿交錯地前進着。『誰不使勁呀！誰偸懶呀！媽</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>— （吹）</p>
<p>前日日本有田大使返滬，在官邸發表談話中，有「放任一切，任其進展，固亦一法，惟不令放任，務必努力」云云，譚老三日，政治家的術語，眞是難懂得很，所謂放任怎樣？不放任又怎樣？我想放任不過如此如此，不放任也不過這般這般，與其這般這般，寗願如此如此，悉聽尊便吧，這是我的術語。</p>
<p>參加二二六事變的日近衛師團及第一師團部隊兵士，有一千三百六十名，被分別扣押於原屬部隊，經東京軍法會議檢察官嚴密偵查後，十九日釋放一千三百二十人，並可宣吿無罪，譚老三曰，日本轟轟烈的二二六事變，到此也不管二七十四，二八十六，將這一篇無量數代價的壞賬，也算馬馬虎虎揭過了可惜。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的蛋，要命嗎！』那臉上有大麻點的小工第一個掉過腦袋來。『嚕　什麽來着，大家是吃這苦命飯飯』接着又是第二個……</p>
<p>大家一搭話，勁兒反鬆弛了。</p>
<p>鐵輪在石子街上滾動得遲緩，於是，後面擋車柄的小工又破口罵起來：一媽的蛋，誰又生了四支胳臂推着？你們裝死，老子可累不了，大家不幹，連苦命飯都沒到嘴。老闆發火，你們就沒話見回答了，跟我鬥氣，媽的蛋，我還不是跟你們一樣的苦命鬼」……話沒完———終於</p>
<p>鐵輪陷在石子街上的窒穴裏了。</p>
<p>「出力拉啊」！前面四個小工苦惱地衝着腦袋，灣着腰，拚出全身氣力，粗的火麻繩壓在肩上，沉重地，額上冒出黑的汻珠，拉着，拉着，可是車身沒移動分毫，鐵輪在崎嶇的石子街上生下了根似的，掉過腦袋來扮着苦惱的臉，大家默然地，似乎都在譴責着自己的無謂的嘮叨。終於，臉上有大麻點的小工扔下繩索，走到鐵輪邊，伸出挺粗的胳膊，挽着鐵輪：</p>
<p>「出力拉呀，出力推呀！」</p>
<p>鐵輪終於在吰呌中轉動起來了，發出鐵與石磨擦的聲響，衝破春之寂寞，驚走了店夥的白日之夢。而小工們的生活與命運，是擊縛於鐵輪上的，不可停息，一天又一天，一年又一年……</p>
<h3>沒落的人</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>——故鄉紀事之二——</p>
<p>「二少奶·買菜去，早呀！」</p>
<p>每天消晨，總是披散着一頭沒梳理的亂蓬蓬的白髮二少奶，照例摯着大保——六歲的孫子，從那座油金紅漆被風雨陽光剝蝕得斑爛的大屋門跨出來，鄰居們瞧見誰就會故意提高嗓子合她打招呼。而二少奶呢，戴一付薄眶近視眼鏡，翻一翻罩在玻璃圈內沉滯無力的眼晴瞪瞪對方，笑了笑，隨着這笑她那渾是堆着深厚的縐紋的臉，便一條條賴皮似的細摺起來，她的左手緊挾着大何的　膊，緩吞吞走過，一雙小得可憐的，幾乎支持不住自己的身體的纏足，就在崎嶇的石子路上一步一擺，遠遠瞥去。</p>
<p>假如人偶然從那座破舊的但是龐大屋宇帶着一種回憶看起，另後再看屋主人類廢蒼老的樣子，以及終年拖着張菜黃色的　臉的大保，你會因此很不相關地感嘆着：（未完）</p>
<h3>娜拉（十六）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作圖　忻炘炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉把通郝爾茂書房的門閂了，然後呌柯樂克進來。</p>
<p>柯樂克是爲接了郝爾茂的辭退信而來的，他要求復職，不然便把那個假簽名的借據公佈出來。他說：「我想恢復我在社會上的地位，以前這十八個月裏頭我一些壞事都不曾做，雖然日子苦得很，但是我總耐着性一步一步的掙上去，現在我又被入推下來了。」</p>
<p>娜拉沒有辦法，雖然她很害怕。</p>
<p>於是，柯樂克便把給郝爾茂的信扔在信箱裹走了。</p>
<p>這時候，林敦夫人修好了那伴舞衣走了進來，見了娜拉很心亂的樣子，便追問爲些什麽事。</p>
<p>娜拉吿訴了她。（娜拉雖然很害怕這事情的暴發，但是她也有個「奇事」的夢）林敦夫入自吿奮勇的說：「我和柯樂克當面去講，曾經有一個時候無論什麽事情他都肯答應我的。」</p>
<p>這時候，郝爾茂却敲起門來了，隔着門問：「娜拉，你爲什麼把門都閂起來了？」</p>

<p>標準歌唱團由「接送專員」陳耀庭先生東拉西湊後先來個「交易」，據陳先生的領導下想到了閘張日期播出來的成績，終不差起的。</p>
<p>預測今晚也許有：「我送你回去好嗎。」的話兒播出來，並且可以聽許多由陳領導親自和小姐們合唱，像：「我的愛人就是你」，「我不能忘了你」等等！</p>
<p>「歌唱團」好像極容易創辦的，但旣名之曰「標準」，倒要瞧瞧他之標準荳腐本領！（就是我）</p>
<p>金郎曰：據說陳耀庭先生由於他的開麥拉的帮忙，對於各歌唱團體的歌星都是相當熟識的，他有一個了不得的尊號曰「接送專員」，這就可見陳先生也是歌唱團體中的一位紅人，由他所組織的「標準歌唱團」當然是「很不錯的樣子」了。</p>

<p>一個發展事業亡命關外</p>
<p>梁賽珠與哈特的「並不不認識」問題，至此吿一段落了。因為梁小姐的信中沒有提出「並不認識」的反証的反証，哈特祇是否認「舊情人」而己。茲將變方來信發刊於后：</p>

<h3>卓別林的「摩登時代」</h3>
<p>南京大上海下次同時獻映</p>
<p>（上略）弟為一忠實靑年，除關心發展自身的事業之外，對女人一事，素來疏遠，何况梁賽珠是一現代紅舞女，弟為一現代之窮光蛋，那配談戀愛！戀愛是有產階級佔有的東西，豈不是癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉嗎？雖說，我在幾年前認識梁賽珠，這也不過是認識她而己，如果說，認識就是戀愛，那末我還認識她的父母，姊妹呢。這不是笑話奇談嗎？我以前雖在小晨報上看到同樣的事情，說我曾為了戀愛梁賽珠而脫離家庭，亡命關外，來回京滬，福建，杭，錫各地，并曾一度自殺，當時我想去信更正，嗣因小晨報關門了。弟之所以脫離家庭，亡命關外，來回各地，實為自救也。并非為的是梁賽珠，同時并沒有自殺過，請吾兄偕電影更正。（下略）哈特</p>

This organ is under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters and has no connection with the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Ji-Cha diplomacy can only proceed after contacting all parties.

With regards to the adjustment of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, if the people of both countries can cooperate sincerely, then it will not be difficult to improve relations.

During the Huanghuagang Uprising, our party saw great progress in methods, organization, and discipline. All of this was achieved through determined sacrifice and struggle. Therefore, the cornerstone of our party and government is stained with the blood and structured by the bones of countless martyrs. We should strive to preserve and promote it. The facts of the martyrs' resolute uprisings are well known to everyone and need not be repeated. However, the spirit of the martyrs and its influence are urgently deserving of mention. 1.

From the above observations, it can be seen that the success of the revolution was brought about by the "hard work" spirit of the martyrs, who found new roads in hardship and despair.

<h3>Assailant in Wang Jingwei Assassination Case Confesses; General Headquarters Established in Hong Kong; Conspiracy to Assassinate Song Ziwen and Members of the League of Nations Investigation Team; Hong Kong Government Captures Four Criminals, Soon to Be Extradited for Trial</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Yuhua and He Guang, accomplices in the assassination case of the former President of the Executive Yuan, have confessed. Further details have emerged regarding the masterminds of the case, Wei Chen Ming, and Li Ji. Zhang and He have also confessed that Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi were tasked by Chen and Li to carry out the plans. They established a general assassination headquarters in Hong Kong and also attempted to assassinate former Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in Shanghai, killing Song's secretary and a bodyguard at the scene. They also conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations Investigation Team who came to China, but failed. Yu Likui personally went to the scene to command the assassination of Song. Wang Yaqiao has many followers, and his most important cadres, such as Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, are hiding in the general headquarters in Hong Kong, where they plan assassinations for Wang. They contributed greatly to the Wang Jingwei assassination case. Based on the above clues, our government immediately notified the Hong Kong government to issue arrest warrants and sent personnel to the addresses to arrest the murderers. Yu Likui, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and Zhang Zhihan have been arrested, and a lot of evidence of their daily planning of assassination events was found in their headquarters. They are currently detained by the Hong Kong government and can be extradited soon for trial. It is reported that the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court will prosecute the four criminals in a separate case. As soon as they are extradited, an investigation will be conducted according to law, and a public prosecution will be filed. The salient points of Zhang Yuhua's confession in the capital police station on November 18 last year are as follows. The plaintiff was Shen Siding, and the recorder was Yan Dongkui. Zhang confessed that the masterminds of the assassination of President Wang were Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi. Yu, using the pseudonym Li Zian, had previously teamed up to assassinate Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in Shanghai, killing Song's secretary and a bodyguard. Yu Likui was at the scene to command the assassination. They also conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations Investigation Team who came to China, but failed. Hua, using the pseudonym Hu Yunqing, is the president of the Chenguang Society. Hua Kezhi jointly directed all plans and actions in Beijing with Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui. The assassination attempt was planned around the time of January 28 in Yu Likui's home in Shanghai. The participants were Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Sun Fengming, Xu Zhiyuan, Hua Kezhi, Wang's brother-in-law, and I. Wang, Yu, and Hua were the most radical. In November of the 23rd year [1934] the Yu Zhongquan [Central Committee] meeting, He Poguang, Zhang Yuhua, and I were ordered by Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi to go to the Central Party Headquarters to take the opportunity to assassinate Chairman Chiang. Sun Fengming carried a pistol. On that day, Chiang had a toothache and left the meeting hall before it ended. When he got into the car, we were close to Chiang next to the car, but we were not determined at that time, so we did not act. Because the assassination was unsuccessful, Wang and Yu were dissatisfied and sent Hua to Beijing to question us. This spring [spring of the 24th year], Sun, Guo Huizhong, and I were summoned to Hong Kong to meet with Yu and then returned to Beijing. It was decided to assassinate at the Sixth Plenary Session. A week before the incident, Hua personally came to Beijing with Sun. The assassination targets were still Chiang and Wang. Because Chiang was not present, only Wang was assassinated. If Chiang had been present, he would not have been spared. Wang's cadres in Shanghai were Cai Daosu, Xu Zhiyuan, and Hua Kezhi. Those who went to Hong Kong from Shanghai to live there were Zhang Yuhua, Wang Yaqiao, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and Zhang Zhihan, who specialized in planning assassinations and contributed greatly to the Wang Jingwei assassination case. This transcript was read aloud in court, and the person under interrogation acknowledged that it was correct before signing, affixing his seal, and being dismissed from the court.

<h3>The Important Promotion of the Baojia Movement (Part 1) by Li Songfeng, Director of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>1.  The Significance and Current Situation of the Baojia Movement</p>
<p>To understand the significance of the Baojia movement, we must first understand what "Baojia" is. According to the general explanation, "Bao" is the administration that groups civilians together, and "Jia" is the administration that organizes able-bodied men. The function of Baojia is to compile and investigate the population and able-bodied men, and its purpose is to implement self-defense. This explanation cannot be said to be wrong; however, we feel that it is somewhat narrow. Because the essence of the Baojia system is by no means exhausted by the two words "self-defense"; it can really be said to be a system with comprehensive political, economic, educational, and security effects. If we want to put it simply, we can also say that it is a system of organizing the people. What is the "Baojia movement"? It is the general term for the steps taken to achieve the Baojia system.</p>
<p>The Baojia system is not a newly invented thing. Its essence existed as far back as the Zhou and Qin dynasties. By the Northern Song Dynasty, the system was formally established in both substance and form, which was the famous "Wang Jinggong Baojia Law". After the Song Dynasty, although the methods of the past dynasties have changed, the spirit of Baojia has always existed. The recent rise of the Baojia movement can be said to be a stage in the evolution of the Baojia system, and not the creation of a new system.</p>
<p>We certainly do not need to talk about the historical development of the Baojia system, but we seem to have to explain the recent situation of the Baojia movement slightly: - We know that the recent Baojia movement should divide a new period from August of the 21st year; because before this, although there were provinces that promoted Baojia, they were small-scale and partial; In August of the 21st year, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the provinces of Henan and Anhui formulated the regulations for the compilation and investigation of Baojia household registration in the counties within the bandit suppression area, and ordered the provinces within the bandit suppression area to handle it seriously. From this time on, the formal large-scale Baojia movement was launched. Because the provinces in the bandit suppression area achieved great results in handling Baojia, and its effectiveness in clearing the countryside was the most obvious, the provinces outside the bandit suppression area also gradually adopted it, so the promotion became wider and wider. By October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Interior believed that because more and more provinces were handling Baojia, and many existing systems were affected by the implementation of Baojia, it was necessary to establish and adjust the foundation of the Baojia movement and the relationship between the promotion of Baojia and other systems as soon as possible; therefore, it submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the Central Political Conference, and proposed the 432nd meeting resolution: "Local Baojia work is related to local security and is the foundation of local autonomy. The Executive Yuan should order all provinces and cities to handle it in advance." This is the solid foundation established by the Baojia movement in the central legal system. Based on this resolution, the Executive Yuan ordered all provinces and cities across the country to comply. At present, there are 14 provinces and cities that have handled Baojia, including Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Beijing, and Ping; and there are provinces such as Hebei that are in the process of preparation: it cannot be said to be not widespread. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior and the Legislative Yuan are working hard to study the relationship between Baojia and various political systems, and want to build a legal foundation for the Baojia system. After the Fifth National Congress, the Central Government added a Local Autonomy Planning Committee, and the promulgation of unified Baojia regulations will definitely be realized soon.</p>
<p>2.  The Importance of the Baojia Movement</p>
<p>The above has simply talked about the meaning and current situation of the Baojia movement, and now we will further talk about the importance of the Baojia movement. We know that Baojia is a kind of popular organization, and based on this organization, we can exert its effectiveness in all aspects; therefore, its importance must be observed from many aspects, and it is not very simple.</p>
<p>Observing from the aspect of organizing the people - the country takes the people as its constituent elements, and to combine many people to form a country, it is necessary to rely on organization, so without organization, it cannot become a country. How to organize the people? The methods of various countries are different, and most of them are determined according to the environment of the country. Political, economic, religious, cultural... all kinds of organizations together constitute the organization of the social country. However, among many kinds of organizations, there must be a central organization. This organization is not only the center of the composition of society, but also the center of various organizations; this kind of central organization is the local self-government organization of various countries. In the past, the central organization of our country was the family, which was too narrow in scope, and it was necessary to expand it; therefore, we have also adopted the organization of local autonomy in recent times. However, the local autonomy of foreign countries is based on people, which is somewhat different from our past "family" basis. The local autonomy organization based on individuals must be completed by us, which is not a problem; however, due to historical inheritance and the low level of education, there will inevitably be many difficulties in implementation, at least in the present and the near future, the situation will be like this, so we want to organize the people, it seems that we should not abandon the organizational foundation of the "family". The Baojia system is an organizational method based on the family. In recent years, we have learned from practical experience that Baojia is more effective than autonomy in bandit suppression, which is proof that the method of organizing the people based on the "family" is stronger than the method of organizing the people based on "people" at this stage. China is now facing an unprecedented national crisis, and if we want to overcome this difficulty, we can only organize the people of the whole country to work together; the best way to organize the people is "Baojia". Therefore, the current Baojia movement is really the most important thing.</p>
<p>Observing from the aspect of consolidating national defense - Everyone knows that there is a saying: "No national defense, no country." Therefore, the country and national defense cannot be separated. If we want to maintain the country, we must first rectify national defense. Modern national defense is centered on the army, but the elements of national defense are not limited to the army; its scope can include everything in the country, and all the people are combatants, and all departments of industry must join the war; therefore, there is the term "national general mobilization". How can the people of a country be generally mobilized? How can general mobilization have the greatest effect? This depends on whether its people are organized and trained at ordinary times. The so-called training must first have organization, and after organization, it must also be trained. These two things should not be separated. Therefore, organizing and training the people is the most important thing in the country. Regarding organization, as mentioned earlier, in today's China, of course, the best is "Baojia"; the implementation of training is also best suited to using "Baojia". - Because: First, Baojia is a universal organization, which meets the requirements of general mobilization; second, Baojia has "home" as its solid foundation, which is easy to control; third, from the nature of Baojia itself, there is also a need for training. The able-bodied men's team organized by Baojia is an organization that is being trained. Self-defense warfare requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. The Baojia organization is the cement that binds the people of the whole country together. Self-defense warfare certainly does not require everyone to come forward, but everyone must be active under the purpose of the war, and it is collective activity. Baojia is a tool to realize the collective activities of the people. Therefore, from the perspective of national defense, Baojia is also particularly important.</p>
<p>Observing from the aspect of maintaining social order - The maintenance of social order is divided into two types: active and passive. The active one is to eliminate the state of affairs that endangers social order; the passive one is to prevent the factors that endanger social order from occurring or existing. Comparing the two, the passive method is naturally the best. If the passive method can take effect, there is no need to use the active method again. The responsibility of the police is to maintain social order. Although there is also so-called preventive police, in practice, the performance of the police is mostly based on post-event relief. If we want to achieve complete prevention, it is by no means the power of the police that can take effect alone, and we must rely on the efforts of the people themselves; therefore, the people's self-defense is particularly needed. The Baojia organization is based on the compilation and investigation of household registration, and there are also joint guarantee, quick sitting guarantee, and Baojia regulations to regulate it. It connects the people into a whole through joint methods and interests; not only can external harm not invade, but also internal harmful factors cannot occur: the result is naturally to achieve the effect of passively defending social order. Because Baojia has a particularly obvious effect in this regard, it has caused many people to think that Baojia is a purely self-defense organization, which can also prove from the reverse side the importance of Baojia in maintaining social order.

<h3>Analysis of the European Situation After the London Conference</h3>
<p>— Corner</p>
<p>Germany, with a thunderclap, tore up the Locarno Pact, completely wiping out some of the achievements left behind by Briand and Stresemann. Now, Germany has reverted to the traditional spirit of Prussia, and France has reverted to the traditional fears of the Latin nations. The Rhine River, which divides the German-French border, will once again murmur for the discord between the two major European nations.</p>
<p>It is premature to say that war will break out in Europe after the failure of the London Conference. However, the great impact of the failure of this conference cannot be ignored. We will see new military alliances replacing the old collective security, active military expansion replacing passive disarmament, and secret diplomacy replacing open diplomacy. Those who advocate overthrowing the status quo and attempt to profit from the chaos will form one camp, while those who advocate maintaining the status quo and upholding collective security will form another camp. This situation did not begin after the failure of the London Conference, but it has become more intense, blatant, and symbolic at present.</p>
<p>The camp that maintains the status quo can be roughly analyzed as having France and the Soviet Union as its backbone and the Little Entente as its wings. The camp that opposes the status quo has Germany as its stronghold and Poland and Bulgaria as its wings. Britain has reverted to its traditional policy of maintaining the balance of power on the continent. However, if we analyze the current situation in Europe in detail, we can see that the European countries have different interests and different goals. Even if they belong to the same camp, there are great differences in their hearts. Since Britain and Italy, the important guarantors of Locarno, are at odds with France, it is natural for France and the Soviet Union to become closer. The foreign policies of Czechoslovakia and Romania have always followed France's lead, and Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union have also signed a mutual assistance pact. Germany's eastward expansion policy is sufficient to make Czechoslovakia and Romania loyal satellites of France and the Soviet Union. What deserves attention is Yugoslavia in the Little Entente. In recent years, Germany has purchased large quantities of agricultural products in Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia's inclination towards Germany is quite strong. However, whether it will side with Germany or remain neutral at a critical moment depends on the development of the European situation. The direction of Yugoslavia is a point that we must understand and that future European observers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Speaking of the camp that opposes the status quo, Poland and Germany have signed a ten-year non-aggression pact, and the relationship between Germany and Poland has been close for a long time. However, Poland, sandwiched between Germany and Russia, fears Germany and also fears the Soviet Union. It does not want German troops to pass through its territory, just as it does not want Russian troops to pass through its territory. Therefore, Poland's pro-German stance is forced by power and not entirely from its own heart. Whether it will be a loyal ally of Germany in the future is still a question.</p>
<p>From the current situation, Germany's position in Europe is still very isolated. It must obtain the assistance of another fascist country, Italy, to increase its strength. However, Germany wants to annex Austria and Hungary, while Italy regards Austria and Hungary as forbidden zones. The conflict of interests cannot be reconciled. Although these two countries with the same system have recently held secret talks to seek a combination, the result is extremely dim. Germany does not have a strong ally and is afraid that it will not be able to achieve anything. Its only hope is British assistance. However, Britain has been riding two horses until now. It hopes that France will resolve the current difficulties with a broad mind, and it also hopes that Germany will contribute to European peace to dissipate the European tension caused by Germany. However, France does not have a broad mind, and Germany does not have a peaceful contribution. Britain will eventually be as ambiguous as it has been with other European affairs in the past and end up unresolved. This result will eventually brew into an uncontrollable situation. The failure of the London Conference is a harbinger.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union Signed a Mutual Assistance Pact to Actively Train a Strong Army to Jointly Resist Foreign Aggression</h3>
<p>Moscow: Relations between Japan and Russia are becoming more strained today. The Soviet Russian government has announced the signing of a mutual assistance treaty with Soviet Outer Mongolia. The treaty stipulates that if Outer Mongolia is attacked by Japan, Soviet Russia will provide military assistance, and implies that Outer Mongolia is training a strong domestic army, and that the Soviet Russian army of 1.3 million men will immediately unite with it to deal with the invasion of other countries into Mongolian territory. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to news from Kulun, the Soviet Union has recently signed a mutual assistance pact with Outer Mongolia. Officials here refused to comment on it. Political figures said that this pact is of utmost importance, and how the Far Eastern situation will develop in the future, as well as the general international situation, will be affected by it. Japan and the puppet Manchukuo are exerting pressure on Outer Mongolia, and the Soviet Union is providing technical assistance to it. Now, the mutual assistance pact has been established, and its intention is to make this technical assistance legally based. Or, based on political and economic motives, the Soviet Union has already recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia (the Soviet Union is the only country in the world that recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia). The relationship between the two sides was originally very close. With the addition of the mutual assistance pact, the Soviet Union will be able to establish a true protectorate over Outer Mongolia.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops' Provocative Actions Outer Mongolia Protests to the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Mongolian government has protested to the "Foreign Minister of Manchukuo" regarding the invasion of the Mongolian border by Japanese and Manchu troops from March 24 to 26. The Mongolian government expressed surprise that the Mongolian and "Manchu" governments were negotiating to resolve and prevent border conflicts, but then launched provocative attacks on the Mongolian border. The Mongolian government continued that such attacks could only be regarded as intentionally undermining the negotiations and intentionally increasing the severity of the disputes caused by the continuous invasion of the Mongolian border by Japanese and Manchu troops. Finally, the Mongolian government demanded that effective measures be taken immediately to stop such provocative actions, and that all responsibility should be borne by the "Manchu government."

<h3>Near Changlingzi Japanese and Russian Forces Are Heavily Guarded Both Sides Concentrate Forces Prepare for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>Harbin: After the Changlingzi incident, although the Japanese and Soviet troops automatically withdrew and the atmosphere eased slightly, the two sides are still heavily guarded due to mutual suspicion and fear. It is learned that the Soviet Union, in preparation for a possible Japanese attack, has concentrated its forces near Changlingzi, preparing for combat. As of the 27th, the number had reached nearly 5,000 men. The Japanese army also took similar actions, and its strength was even greater than that of the Soviet army. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow: "Izvestia" commented on the talks between Stomonyakov and Ota, saying that the facts prove that the aggressive group of the Japanese military, represented by the Kwantung Army, is afraid that Soviet-Japanese relations can be improved, so it is determined to adopt provocative methods to prevent this improvement work. According to reliable sources, the opposition of the aggressive military group can also explain why the organization of a mixed border commission to restrain border conflicts and the organization of a mixed commission to investigate the incident on January 30 have been delayed, because the governments of both countries have agreed to this principle. The Soviet government has agreed to "revise the border" if the Japanese and "Manchu" sides can respect the existing border and maintain border peace. However, the recent provocative actions on the borders of Soviet Manchuria and Mongolian Manchuria indicate that adventurers obviously want to destroy border peace, and their purpose is to make the aforementioned border commission unable to be established. Why does the Japanese government propose to organize a "revise the border" committee and a border commission only limited to the eastern border of Soviet Manchuria, while keeping most of the border in its original state? This is really puzzling. Is this strange proposal due to the aggressive elements in the Japanese military exerting pressure on its government, sparing no expense to preserve the deteriorating relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, so that they will still have the possibility of causing Soviet-Japanese border conflicts in the future, at least in a large part of the border? We cannot explain why the committee, which is considered useful by the governments of both countries, is only limited to a small part of the border. The Soviet people also feel strange that the Japanese government claims to be willing to improve Soviet-Japanese relations, but is unwilling to organize a similar committee on the Mongolian-Manchu border. Does the Japanese government not understand that to maintain peace in the Far East, it is necessary to obtain peace on the border between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia? The Soviet government has repeatedly declared its policy in a clear and frank manner, stating that it is very concerned about the integrity of the Mongolian People's Republic, so it cannot stand idly by when Mongolia is attacked. If the Japanese government really wants to maintain peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, it will never make such a claim, that is, peace is only maintained on the Soviet-Manchu border, and only limited to the Xingkai Lake and Korean borders. Similarly, if Japan is determined to have peace, it cannot condone the existing relations on the Mongolian-Manchu border. Some Japanese think that the Soviet government's proposal to organize a Mongolian-Manchu border commission is aimed at seeking to participate in this work. This is purely fictitious and does not need to be proven. Everyone knows that the Soviet government never asked to participate in the negotiations in Manchuria in 1935, although the negotiations in Manchuria were actually controlled by Japan. The Soviet government still maintains its original position and does not want to participate in the organization of the Mongolian-Manchu commission, but it believes that this commission is very useful for easing border tensions. The Soviet Union's efforts in the East are to defend peace and oppose adventurers and provocateurs, and the same is true in the West. The Soviet government severely attacked any attempt to invade the Soviet border, exposed the conspiracy of the Japanese soldiers who challenged it, and will continue its past policy, striving to maintain peace with the Japanese government and the "Manchukuo" government. At the same time, we deeply believe that the vast majority of the Japanese people who do not want war will definitely support this effort. (TASS Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Total Budget Exceeds 2.3 Billion The Expenditure on the Navy and Army Is Huge, and the Only Way Is to Raise Debt and Increase Taxes</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The total budget for the 11th year, in the unestablished budget, has reached 2.318 billion yen. In the budget being implemented, the surge in disaster countermeasures and incentive funds will increase by about 30 million yuan, so the total budget will exceed 2.3 billion yuan. It is already certain that the amount of public debt issued as a result will increase by 30 million yuan from the unestablished budget of 680 million yuan. (Daimeng Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: As a result of the meeting of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the estimated implementation budget and supplementary budget for the next year to be submitted to the special Diet totaled 2.31 billion yen, and the amount of deficit public bonds issued was 710 million yen. Compared with the budget bill that was not established in the 65th Diet, the expenditures increased by 32 million yen, and the issuance of public bonds also increased by 30 million yen. The expenses required for the new policies of the current cabinet are not included, so a part of the new policies will be used as the second supplementary budget before the special Diet, and both expenditures and the issuance of public bonds will expand. Therefore, the Takahashi fiscal policy of gradually reducing public debt has long been dead, and the budget bill for the next year completely contains the color of the Maba fiscal policy. (Dentong Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Finance held a budget meeting at the Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 28th to review the implementation budget bill for the 11th year. On the same day, the general situation of revenue was first discussed, and it generally followed the unestablished budget of the previous decision. However, the implementation of the new budget will be delayed for two months due to the dissolution of the Diet, during which time the revenue from revising the Iron and Steel Industry Promotion Law increased by 870,000 yuan, the revenue from revising the Mineral Oil Tariff increased by 600,000 yuan, and the revenue from revising the Horse Racing Law increased by 770,000 yuan. However, the corresponding decrease in this item, the Navy's relationship, can increase revenue by 5 million yuan. In the end, the unestablished budget, its regular and temporary revenue totaled 1.597 billion yuan, will increase by nearly 3 million yuan. The decision was then discussed on expenditures. In general, there was no change to the unestablished budget of the previous decision of various provinces, and the total amount of funds was approved as follows: Imperial Household Expenses 4.500 (thousand yuan) Ministry of Foreign Affairs 3.000 Ministry of Finance 495.000 Ministry of the Army 570.000 Ministry of the Navy 551.000 Ministry of Commerce and Industry 18.000 Other provinces can be seconded and decided on the 30th. As for the implementation budget of the special accounting, it will be reviewed after the review of the ordinary accounting part is completed. (Daimeng Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Oil Industry Nationalized</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japan's oil industry has been nationalized today, and a cartel with a capital of 300,000 yen will be established to manage it. The name is the United Petroleum Co., Ltd. This new organization is directly under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and is a joint sales agency for the six major oil companies in Japan. This new company will only sell gasoline in 1936-37, but it will be difficult to continue to increase and sell other types of oil in the future.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the quantity of oil consumption in Japan in the next fiscal year has been set at 31.230.000 kiloliters, which is allocated as shown in the table below: Oil Type Consumption Quantity (in kiloliters) Gasoline 1.245.000 Kerosene 130.000 Machine Oil 160.000 Heavy Oil 1.460.000 Light Oil 153.000 Personnel from the province said that the list above is based on the consumption quantity of this year. As for the parts of the two major foreign oil companies, Asahi and Mobil, there will be an actual reduction because they still refuse to be bound by the Oil Industry Management Regulations. According to the regulations, foreign oil companies must have six and a half months of oil reserves. (Translated Telegram by the Foreign Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Austria-Hungary Form a Group to Maintain Their Position in Central Europe Hungarian Prime Minister Leaves Rome for Home</h3>
<p>Moscow: The newspaper "Krasnaya Svesda" commented on the Rome meeting between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, saying that "Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed an agreement in Rome on establishing a trilateral group, marking a new stage in the struggle for influence in Central Europe. When Germany attempted to seize Austria by fascist means, Italy responded to this attempt by concentrating its troops in the Brenner Pass. At this time, Germany was forced to retreat temporarily. However, the environment has changed. Italy's war against Abyssinia shifted its attention to Central Europe. Austria feared that Germany would exert pressure again and began to befriend the countries of the Little Entente. On the other hand, this made German aggression more and more radical, making Italy deeply afraid that its position in Central Europe and the Danube region would tend to be shaken. Recent reports of Germany's active activities in the Danube countries have become common in newspapers. The meeting between Italy and Austria-Hungary shows that Italy is unwilling to give up its position in the Danube countries." (TASS Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>Germany: Brown Election Begins at Dawn; Nationwide Voters Enthusiastically Cast Ballots; Opposition Votes Expected to Be Less Than 10%</h3>
<p>Berlin – Residents of Berlin and other places were awakened this morning to not forget the election. From 7:00 AM, the streets were filled with the rumbling of vehicles, the marching sounds of Black Shirt and Brown Shirt comrades in formation, and the singing and cheering of crowds, deafening the ears. Today's election can be called a brown election, as Brown Shirts are visible everywhere in the streets and inside and outside the polling places. The authorities used an ingenious method to ensure that the people fulfill their civic duty to vote. Those who have voted are given a gilded badge to wear on their chest, and those without this badge are not allowed to enter the racetrack or other entertainment venues in the afternoon. The weather is clear, and many people are voting. It is estimated that by 1:00 PM, 70% of the electorate has voted. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The election voting is scheduled to begin at 8:00 AM this morning and end at 6:00 PM this afternoon. There are a total of 46 million voters. The result of the vote against the National Socialist Party is expected to be no more than 10%. As the number of voters has greatly increased, the number of members of parliament will also slightly increase compared to the current number of 661, each with an annual salary of £640. There are a total of 1,035 candidates in this election.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the airships "Hindenburg" and "Graf Zeppelin" soared through the sky several times, campaigning for the election. They dropped countless small parachutes, each adorned with swastika flags, while propaganda leaflets fell like snowflakes. Soon after, they flew away. They returned after nightfall, the ships ablaze with electric lights, and projected multiple beams of light into the sky, making the clouds transparent and as bright as day – a truly magnificent sight. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The weather is clear and pleasant today. The Reichstag election began at 9:00 AM this morning and is scheduled to end at 6:00 PM this afternoon. Polling places are set up in various cafes, schools, and major train stations, similar to previous years. National Socialist Party paramilitary personnel are stationed in front of the doors to maintain order. The ballot features a circle next to the words "National Socialist Party," as well as the titles and names of the Führer Adolf Hitler, Minister Without Portfolio Hess, Interior Minister Frick, Aviation Minister and Prussian Governor-General Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and one of the National Socialist Party leaders, Wagner. Voters are to mark a cross in this circle and then seal and deposit the ballot into the ballot box. Members of the National Socialist Party youth organizations have formed bicycle teams and are traveling throughout the city playing military bugles to urge citizens to vote and support Führer Hitler. Today, commemorative buildings and residences throughout the country are decorated with flags and colorful streamers to celebrate. Berlin citizens who have participated in the voting and completed their "electoral duty" will receive a silver shield badge, bright and dazzling, easily visible. Therefore, voters in the city are rushing to obtain this "honor" before the end of today's election, in order to show their loyalty to the Führer. According to news from Braunschweig, National Socialist Party paramilitary motorized units in that city yesterday paraded a bull through the streets, conspicuously displaying a spleen on which was written the phrase "Not voting is being a bull," to satirize and encourage people to participate in the election.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Voting Situation: Hitler Rushes Back to Berlin to Vote; Special Arrangements Ensure Overseas Residents Fulfill Their Civic Duty</h3>
<p>Berlin – On the occasion of the Reichstag election, Führer Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels flew back to Berlin from Cologne this morning. They immediately went to the polling station near Potsdam Station to vote. Cabinet ministers and senior government officials voted in the morning. Foreign Minister Neurath and State Secretary Meissner of the Reich Chancellery voted at the polling station on Kanal Street, which was the place where the late President Hindenburg voted during his lifetime. In addition, ballot boxes have been set up in various stations, and voters can go to vote from 5:00 AM to midnight. The government has also taken necessary measures to force those who have relinquished their right to vote to participate in the voting. The authorities have also sent special agents to various households to strongly invite citizens to go to vote. Members of the Labor Service Corps must present a special certificate before voting. Two members of the National Socialist Party Youth League are guarding in front of each polling station. After voters have voted, they are given a silver badge inscribed with the words "National Holiday of Honor, Freedom, and Peace" to indicate that they have completed their electoral duty. As of the time of this telegram, most residents in the middle-class areas of Berlin have worn this badge, while the number is smaller in the northeastern labor areas. All groups affiliated with the National Socialist Party have mobilized and are parading in the streets. The members of the Youth League are frequently shouting the slogan "Vote for Führer Hitler." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German authorities have made special arrangements, as before, to ensure that Germans living abroad can all have the opportunity to vote.

<h3>Hitler: Final Election Speech; Vows to Fight for Honor and Freedom; Attacks International Politicians</h3>
<p>Cologne – Today is the National Holiday of Honor, Freedom, and Peace. No fewer than 50,000 people from various places came to participate in the celebration, traveling in more than 60 special trains. Führer Hitler personally presided over the ceremony. He met with delegations from various parts of the Rhineland in the famous "Gürzenich" hall and delivered his tenth and final election speech at 8:00 PM in the evening. Beforehand, churches throughout the country rang their bells simultaneously at 7:45 PM. The Führer, accompanied by Defense Minister General von Blomberg, slowly drove in a car through the crowds to the venue. The crowds along the road shouted "Long live!" and the military band played the Badenweiler March. At 8:00 PM, the Führer took the stage and addressed the audience, stating in part:</p>
<p>"Any treaty that is not based on complete freedom and equal rights cannot be signed by Germany." The world should now reflect on the various past mistakes. "The new order that I want to establish is based on the equality of all countries and cannot be based on old ideas and legalistic quibbles. I am now appealing directly to the people of all countries, hoping to enlighten them."</p>
<p>Hitler then fiercely attacked the so-called international "politicians," saying, "Who are they? The entire German nation is now extending its hand to other nations in the hope of dispelling suspicion and speaking with joy, but the politicians of the world are insisting on outdated treaty clauses as an answer. Looking at history, have there ever been peace proposals as great as Germany's proposals? Has the response received been as humble as the one received by Germany? I have done more than anyone else in the world to maintain peace, because I know the horrors of war better than any international politician." "I now regard myself as the defender of Germany's honor and freedom, and all I seek is peace," he said. Führer Hitler is scheduled to go to Godesberg on the Rhine River tomorrow, where he will wait for the announcement of the results of the Reichstag re-election. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Hitler concluded his election campaign last night in Cologne, saying that Germany hoped that the struggle of fighting against many enemies would end soon, but that to build a new world, one could not rely on the empty opinions of elderly politicians and jurists, but should instead rely on the common sense of the people. We know that our strength cannot be depleted by internal strife, but can only be used for external combat.</p>
<p>Hitler arrived in Cologne on the eve of the election and was warmly welcomed by people gathered from all over the Rhineland. This was Hitler's first visit since the German army reoccupied the town. The whole town was full of flags and streamers. Along the way, in addition to the large crowds, there were stormtroopers, Black Guards, and Hitler Youth boys and girls lining both sides. When Hitler passed by, the crowd cheered. He then delivered a speech broadcast throughout the country. Before the speech, all the churches in the country rang their bells to inform the public to prepare to listen to the Führer's last election speech. After the speech, the bells rang again, and then the people sang the old German gratitude song and prayed to the god of war to protect Germany from its enemies. Their songs and prayers were also broadcast on the radio.</p>
<p>In his speech, Hitler expressed his gratitude to the people of the Rhineland for enduring suffering for the sake of the motherland in the past. He then expressed regret at the fact that various countries only made false statements when Germany reached out for friendship. Hitler said that if they cannot understand us, we must be patient, but we must show that we will not give up an iota of freedom, and that our love of peace is real and there is no doubt about it.

<h3>Church Bells Resemble Sermons</h3>
<p>Cologne – After Führer Hitler delivered his speech tonight, the election campaign came to an end. It is learned that before the Führer delivered his speech, more than 20 large and small churches throughout the city rang their bells simultaneously, as if holding a religious ceremony. This was arranged by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Führer Hitler also repeatedly mentioned God in his speech, posing as a preacher. He said, "We have committed countless crimes and should deeply repent to God. God once blessed us, but we did not repay him, so he brought disaster upon us. After suffering, we knew to convert to God and pray sincerely. At this moment, we can only kneel down and pray to Almighty God to bless us so that we can continue to fight for freedom, honor, and peace." Then, the people of the country sang the ancient song of religious warfare, saying, "We now pray to the just God to protect the believers from being killed by the enemy so that they can regain their freedom."

<h3>Before Departure of German Representative from England: Suggestion to Eden; Plan to Defend Franco-Belgian Border; Hope to Postpone Talks</h3>
<p>London – It was learned today that before German Plenipotentiary Ribbentrop returned home from here on Friday, he suggested to British Foreign Secretary Eden that the talks between the chiefs of staff of Britain, France, and Belgium to jointly plan the defense of the Franco-Belgian border should be postponed pending the outcome of negotiations between Western European countries. It is said that Eden replied that the actual date of the talks would be decided at the British Cabinet meeting next Monday, and that this talk was due to Britain's obligations under the Locarno Pact and had to be taken, so it had nothing to do with Germany's reply to the Locarno proposal. However, this talk is solely to discuss technical conditions so that the signatories to the Locarno Pact can fulfill their obligations in the event of unprovoked aggression, and it will be carried out under the strict control of the British Cabinet. It is expected that the British Cabinet will meet next Monday to study the international situation. Although the German government's reply to the Locarno proposal may not have arrived at that time, Foreign Secretary Eden can report to the Cabinet on his talks with General Ribbentrop.

<h3>German Aircraft Fly Over French Airspace; Pilots Punished; Imprisonment for Two Years</h3>
<p>Berlin – Recently, two German aircraft flew over the fortress area near Strasbourg in northeastern France. The local French authorities recorded the aircraft numbers and reported them to the government, which lodged a protest with Germany. Aviation Minister General Göring has ordered that the two pilots of each aircraft be detained in prison for two years as punishment and has notified the aviation attaché of the French Embassy to conclude the case, but has not issued any statement to the newspapers. General Göring has also decided that any aviation personnel who do not follow the rules and fly over the territories of France, Belgium, or Britain will be treated as guilty of treason and will be punished according to law. It is now known that the above-mentioned two aircraft were German military two-seater training aircraft flying from Augsburg to Würzburg (both in Bavaria), so their direction was wrong, at least 60 degrees off. The two pilots are members of a non-official military aviation association. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>France Obtains British Assistance; Curbs Capital Outflow; Bank of France Raises Discount Rate; Rumors of Export Ban Rampant</h3>
<p>Paris – France, with the help of Britain, is making every effort to prevent the outflow of large amounts of cash. It is generally acknowledged that this move may lead to the devaluation of the franc. The Bank of France has raised the discount rate from 3.5% to 5%. Britain's Exchange Equalisation Account is actively buying francs in both London and New York. It is reported that 150 million francs have been transacted in London, with a discount of 2 francs per pound for one month, and 4.125 francs for three months. The price of the US dollar in the Paris market fluctuated between 15.15 and 15.19 francs, closing at 15.19 francs. No cash was shipped to New York today, partly because the clipper ships to the United States would not depart until Wednesday. The financial community expects that there will be no devaluation of the franc before the parliamentary elections on April 26 and May 3. However, rumors of an imminent ban on the export of cash are rampant, which would be tantamount to abandoning the gold standard. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Rambling Notes from Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Record of Hardships</p>
<p>3.  Trip to Yongchuan</p>
<p>A chance opportunity allowed me to go to Yongchuan and see the interior of Sichuan. Yongchuan is a county along the Yangtze River, 240 li upstream from Chongqing. The city is not on the riverbank, but 90 li away, located on the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. I went by long-distance bus operated by the Highway Bureau. The corruption of this highway is simply beyond words. I remember a Westerner's travelogue about China saying that the blue steel car of the Jinpu Railway rocked him to Shanghai like a cradle. Then, heavens! How should I choose a suitable and not exaggerated noun from the dictionary to describe the way the bus travels on this Chengdu-Chongqing road!</p>
<p>The bus traveled in the mountains, among the mountains, and inside the mountains. Sometimes it spiraled up and down, sometimes it was in mountain depressions, sometimes it passed through deep tunnels at the bottom of the mountains. On both sides were steep cliffs, extremely dangerous. If one inadvertently kissed the strange rocks or fell off the deep cliffs, one would surely smash one's head. I had only seen this scene in movies. In the middle of the journey, it rained, and fine threads of rain blew in through the cracks in the windows and dripped from the roof, leaving no place to hide. However, after completing this short journey, the midday sun still blazed high like a fiery canopy. I dragged my body, stiff and numb after five hours of curling up, and moved my heavy steps, wandering on the street. Under the dusty face, there was tiredness hidden. The clothes, wet and then dried, were a mess. Such a strange guest was enough to cause the dogs behind to bark. I thought of myself as being almost like Franklin when he first entered Philadelphia.</p>
<p>At this time, I learned that because the military had requisitioned the buses, there were no buses going up or down. The one I had just taken was the last one. As I was hesitating, I saw a military vehicle and used my persuasive skills to get a ride. Little did I know that unexpected misfortune would immediately follow this unexpected gain. After driving only thirty or forty li, the broken body of the vehicle, which had been rushing to the front line for more than two months, broke down before it could go home to rest. So we all helped to repair the tires and tidy up the machinery, but it was still ineffective. Time passed hour by hour, and the sun slowly hid behind the mountains, and the night gradually unfolded. No pedestrians passed by, and not a wisp of smoke could be seen. This was dangerous enough. In the desolate wilderness, one could be attacked by accident at any time, and I dared not trust those few stalwart "Mr. Eights" (soldiers) too much. Anxiety turned into fear, waiting for what was to come. Ah! Heaven never cuts off all hope! A bus that had slipped through the net came down from the west! After saying all the good things and paying more than the usual fare in advance, they let me squeeze on. However, most of the journey had to be groped in the dark. The heartstrings that had just been loosened were tensed again. Opening my eyes wide, I watched forward more carefully than the driver. Everything was left to his steering wheel.</p>
<p>Yongchuan is a place with beautiful mountains and rivers, but it is dry everywhere, without water sources. There is only a yellow mud ditch in the city, used for drinking and washing away dirt. From a hygienic point of view, the water there is very unsuitable for drinking. I went to Yongchuan prepared to endure hardships, but the unaccustomed diet made me have to worry about my health. So I lived in Yongchuan for more than a month and then left.</p>
<p>4. Autumn on the Jialing River</p>
<p>In the deep autumn, when red leaves are falling and the scenery is desolate, the autumn scenery of the Jialing River attracts tourists like the spring scenery of West Lake. The small steamer between Yu and He (Chongqing and Hechuan) took me to the Hot Springs Park in Beibei, which is a scenic spot in the middle reaches of the Jialing River and a place praised by outsiders and visited by many. The steamboat advanced by stirring the river water, like jade splashing and beads rolling. The green mountains on both sides, dotted with green fields and forests, made people forget that this was a desolate late autumn, and suspect that spring would remain here forever. Entering Guanyin Gorge, large stones occupy the middle of the stream, and waterfalls cascade down like rain. This kind of beautiful scenery has a different kind of interest than the majesty of the Three Gorges. It is a lyrical poem, bright and leisurely, giving people a feeling of serenity and remoteness. If pleasure-seekers consider the Three Gorges to be a grand feast, then the Jialing River is a delicate dim sum.</p>
<p>Arriving in Beibei, I disembarked to visit the park. The Hot Springs Park is three li upstream from Beibei, centered on the hot springs, and opened as a place for recreation based on the mountain terrain. It is a kind of affiliated business of the Gorges Defense Bureau. After we arrived, we first entered the Hanchen Hot Springs to try bathing, in order to relieve the fatigue of being cramped in the ship for half a day. There are two springs, Qianqingbo is open-air and the Yongquan Pool is indoors. Hot air is steaming in the pool, and white mist is hazy. The pool water pours in from the vents, and the temperature is just right for body temperature, containing a large amount of lime, so it is not cold even in the severe winter. In fact, all springs originating from this mountain are warm. At the foot of the mountain, there is a flour mill, which uses the warm spring water that rushes down as the driving force for rotating the machines.</p>
<p>After the bath, I toured the park. The predecessor of the park was the Hot Springs Temple, an ancient temple of the Song Dynasty, which still exists today. The temple contains many antiques, the most spectacular of which is the Ming Dynasty bas-relief coiling dragon incense plate, which is as tall as a person. The main hall is covered with iron tiles, which are ancient and mottled, making people imagine an old monk with white hair, sitting in meditation, truly with thoughts beyond this world. Leaving the temple, passing through the Longqiu Road, we arrived at the Feixue Rock, where a waterfall pours out between two peaks, shaped like a bolt of white silk. Passing through the Langu Valley in the deep shade of bamboo, we entered the Ruhua Cave. The cave is extremely winding and deep, with skylight occasionally revealed in the darkness. Stalactites hang down, and when tapped, they emit a sound of metal and stone. At the deepest point, one can faintly hear the sound of springs, but one cannot explore its end. Turning back and going out through another cave entrance, one suddenly opens up to brightness.</p>
<p>I spent the evening at the Shufan Building. The building was built facing the river, and one could count the sails on the river. When the night tide first rose, the stars were faint and the clouds flowed, and the mist was like miasma. The trees moved in the cold wind, and the sound of autumn was made. The shadows of the high peaks were reflected in the river, suspected to be mountain demons. I feel that the beauty of the Hot Springs Park is not in the park, nor in the springs, but in a kind of charm of the mountains and rivers that cannot be expressed in words, which makes people melt into it, with a feeling of wishing to grow old in this village.</p>
<p>The next day, I visited the Jinyun Temple. The temple is also an ancient temple, located in Jinyun Mountain, fifteen li from the hot springs. From the park, I went up the mountain to the left for about a li, and climbed the Feilai Pavilion. Looking down on the deep gorges, they were deep and hidden. The waves of the eye were horizontally green, like a belt. Gradually going up, passing Shaolong Temple, I walked along the stream. Passing through the pine forest, I listened to the sound of the pines. Entering the dense forest, the sky and the sun were hidden. Jinyun Temple is hidden in a deep valley, and the halls are blocked by peaks. Just when I was tired from walking in the mountains, I suddenly saw a shared ground, which had the scene of "willows dark, flowers bright, another village." The Han Tibetan Buddhist College is attached to the temple, where people learn Tibetan, exhaust Buddhist principles, and graze among them. The Lion Peak behind the temple looks lush and towering, with a verdant color. It was a pity that it was not possible to climb it because of the lateness of the day.</p>
<p>After the hot spring trip, I visited the various new construction projects in Beibei. The construction projects in Beibei are centered on the Gorges Defense Bureau, a security agency in the Jialing River. The research institutions include the China Western Academy of Sciences, which has four research institutes: biology, geology, physics and chemistry, and agriculture and forestry. The Biology Institute has collected more than 10,000 plant specimens and more than 30,000 insect specimens, and has repeatedly exchanged specimens with museums at home and abroad. The Institute of Physics and Chemistry has collected and chemically tested hundreds of kinds of minerals from eastern Sichuan and the border of Sichuan and Hubei over the years. The Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute has more than 100 mu of farmland, where it tests various plants and raises bee species. The Geological Institute will complete a 1:200,000 geological soil map of Sichuan within three years. The academy is well-equipped and is indeed the only scientific leading institution in western China. Its affiliated Jian Shan Junior High School is located on a small mountain, and the teachers are all experts from the academy, which is quite developed. The exhibits in the local products exhibition hall in the museum are the most special and the most interesting. The items on display are all collected from Kang and Tibet, such as various Yi texts of calligraphy, religious instruments, and scholars' costumes. The social education facilities include a library, a sports field, and a people's park. The park is on Huoyan Mountain, with the grandness of the Songsheng Pavilion and the side view pavilion. Houses are built on the mountain, ponds are built with stones, and the paths are repaired flat, without the need for labor. Climbing the Liaowang Terrace, the scenery of the river is like a painting, all in sight. The transportation projects include the Beichuan Railway, which runs between Baimiaozi and Datiankan, 30 li long, and is the only railway in Sichuan Province. It is as small as a tram, running halfway up the mountain, looking down at the deep gorges, one cannot help but feel frightened. Both sides of the railway are coal mining pits, with Tianfu Coal Mine Company as the giant. The use of this railway is in fact limited to transporting coal. The industrial projects include the Sanxia Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which produces cloth, woolen cloth, blankets, socks, etc., similar to the Sanyou Industrial Society in Shanghai. Others, such as the Jialing River Daily and local hospitals, are all for the benefit of the residents of the gorge area. The people in charge have excellent spirits, and they all take serving the cause as their duty, without any selfish thoughts, which is even more admirable. Recently, the provincial government designated Beibei as a construction experimental zone, and there are unlimited hopes for its future development.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Indictment in the Assassination of Wang Case - Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen Were the Masterminds Behind the Murder - Three Murder Plots, the Initial Target Was Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Following the assassination attempt on the former president of the Executive Yuan, the Jiangsu High Court Fifth Branch dispatched prosecutor Luo Renji to investigate and filed an indictment. The Fifth Branch of the High Court has appointed Lu Wenlan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, along with judges Long Canya and Wu Yuheng, to form a collegiate panel. A public trial is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 30th at the Capital District Court. The full text of the prosecutor's indictment is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Six Defendants: Defendant Zhang Yuhua, also known as Zhang Siming, male, 30 years old, from Gaoyou, employee of Chenguang News Agency, residing in Huxi Township, Bao'ying, currently in custody; He Puguang, also known as He Shaoru, male, 28 years old, from Danyang, reporter for Chenguang News Agency, residing in Yao Yiwan, Zhenjiang, currently in custody; Liu Shurong, also known as Liu Zhonghu, male, 29 years old, from Bao'ying, reporter for Chenguang News Agency, residing on Ningguo Temple Street in Bao'ying City, currently in custody; Li Huaicheng, male, 54 years old, from Wuxi, unemployed, residing at 85 Cihou South Lane, Hartung Road, Shanghai, currently in custody; Xiang Zhonglin, male, 53 years old, from Linhai, Zhejiang, unemployed, residing in Linhai City, currently in custody; Lu Qingqi, male, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang, lawyer, residing at 352 Dashikou, Zhongshan Road, Zhenjiang, currently in custody. The above defendants are involved in case number 28 of the 24th year of the Republic of China, concerning endangering the Republic of China. The investigation has been concluded, and it is deemed that indictment is warranted. The criminal facts, evidence, and the applicable laws are listed below:</p>
<p>Criminal Facts: Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, since the dissolution of the People's Government they organized in Fujian, remained unwilling to concede defeat and continued to seek opportunities to rise again to achieve their goal of seizing national territory and undermining unification. Chen, Li, and others believed that it would be difficult to proceed unless they found ways to disrupt the security of the central and local governments, causing them to fall into disarray. To disrupt the security of the central and local governments, they had to harm key responsible figures in the central government, depriving the central government of its leadership, which was not easy to achieve. There was Wang Yaqiao, who specialized in forming cliques and engaging in assassinations for material gain and was on the run. He had participated in the Fujian Incident and was willing to be used. Therefore, they agreed on a plan to harm key responsible figures in the central government to disrupt the security of the central and local governments. At that time, the original plan was to harm only Chairman Chiang, with Chen and Li responsible for providing economic support, and Wang Yaqiao responsible for conducting the operation. Hua Kezhi (alias Hu Yunqing), who was on the run, and Sun Fengming, who was already dead, were both members of Wang's gang and followed Wang's orders. Wang then entrusted the implementation of the plan to Sun and the task of organizing the agency to conceal the operation to Hua. Sun and Hua both agreed. Defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang were both ideologically left-leaning. Zhang had joined the Communist Party's Social League (Socialist League) and served as a district committee member. He had also joined the Social League and the Communist Party's Workers' Education League. Both were Hua's accomplices. Defendant Liu Shurong was also a former acquaintance of Hua and Zhang. After being instructed by Wang, he first discussed it with Zhang, who expressed his approval. Then, Zhang recommended that Zhang discuss it with He, who also agreed. Hua and Zhang then jointly recruited Liu Shurong to come to Nanjing. The Chenguang News Agency, which they planned to use as a cover for the operation, was then established. The division of labor was as follows: Hua was responsible for financial matters, contacting Chen, Li, and Wang in Hong Kong, and training Sun Fengming and others. Zhang was responsible for all matters within the agency. He was responsible for news gathering and all external affairs. Liu Shurong only helped with news gathering. This was in September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. On October 10th of the same year, the agency began publishing under the name of Chenguang News Agency. However, since the purpose of the agency was not the news agency itself, it did not pay much attention to news gathering and did not publish many articles. Instead, it focused on how to secretly conceal the operation and how to prepare for implementation, in order to launch the operation when the opportunity arose. The six-shot revolver used as a murder weapon had been obtained by Hua Kezhi from Wang Yaqiao and brought to Nanjing. At one point, it was hidden in the home of defendant Lu Qingqi, who was aware of the plan. In December of the same year, the Central Committee held the Fifth Plenary Session, and Chairman Chiang attended a photo session. They believed the opportunity had arrived. The day before, Hua Kezhi encouraged Sun Fengming. At the time, Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang accompanied Sun. However, when Sun approached Chairman Chiang, he became too nervous and failed to act and returned. In the autumn of the 24th year, the President of the Executive Yuan resigned, and Chairman Chiang arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan. They again believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of. He Puguang alone sent Sun to try again. However, Sun did not encounter Chairman Chiang and failed to act. Previously, after the first failed implementation, Chen's associates expressed great dissatisfaction with Hua and cut off funding. The agency's finances inevitably became strained. Defendant Xiang Zhonglin had been recruited to Nanjing by Hua and Zhang to smooth things over with various parties, but the results were nil. As a result, the agency's finances became even more difficult. Fortunately, Li Jishen sent 1,000 yuan from Shanghai, which allowed the agency to continue to operate. At that time, the Central Committee had scheduled the Sixth Plenary Session (the Fourth Session, Sixth Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee) to be held on November 1st of the same year. Hua Kezhi and others believed this was the last opportunity. Several days before the meeting, around October 20th, Hua Kezhi brought Sun Fengming to Nanjing from Shanghai. They discussed it with Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, and others, and decided to act during the photo session after the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session. Furthermore, because the previous two attempts had failed because the target was exclusively focused on Chairman Chiang, they decided to target Chairman Chiang first, then the President of the Executive Yuan. If both failed, they would create a major disturbance. Fearing that Sun Fengming, who was responsible for the implementation, might not be resolute or might be negligent in the event, Hua Kezhi initiated a discussion on the evening of October 28th. Hua Kezhi, Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, and Sun Fengming all participated in the discussion. Xiang Zhonglin, after being recruited to Nanjing by Hua and Zhang, had been residing at the agency. Defendant Li Huaicheng had previously been in contact with Hua and Zhang, and was close to Xiang. Liu was also an old acquaintance. After Xiang resided at the agency, he also frequently visited the agency and heard the secrets. Therefore, Xiang and Li also attended the meeting. At that time, everyone except Liu Shurong spoke, and the rest gave Sun guidance or encouragement. The day before the meeting, He Puguang learned that the Central Party Headquarters had not yet issued news reporter credentials because the agency had published too few articles. He asked Xiang Zhonglin to ask his old friend Xu Renru, who was currently a compiler and chief secretary of the Party History Compilation Committee of the Central Party Headquarters and unaware of the plan, to intercede on his behalf. At the same time, He Puguang also asked Wu Huang and Zhou Xiling, officials of the Central Party Headquarters who were unaware of the plan, to help. Xu agreed to help on the surface, but did not actually intercede. Wu and Zhou each made an inquiry once. On the morning of that day, He Puguang went to collect the credentials and they were issued. He immediately handed them over to Sun Fengming, who used them to enter the venue. At around 10:00 AM on November 1st, after the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Party Headquarters, all the members of the Central Committee stood in front and back rows to take a photograph in front of the meeting hall entrance. After the photograph was taken, the members in the back row turned and entered the meeting hall first. The members in the front row were the last to turn and enter. The President of the Executive Yuan happened to be in the front row. At that time, Sun Fengming was hidden among the crowd of people next to the camera. Seeing this situation, he rushed out of the crowd and suddenly fired three shots at the President of the Executive Yuan, hitting him in the left cheekbone, upper left back, and back. Fortunately, the wounds were not fatal. Sun Fengming was immediately hugged by Central Committee member Zhang, wounded by guards, and sent to the hospital for treatment. He eventually died at 3:45 AM on November 2nd due to excessive injuries. Defendants Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi were subsequently arrested in Shanghai, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places. The Capital Police Department, along with other suspects considered to be involved in the case, Guo Zhimou, Guo Fei, Zhou Xiling, Wu Huang, and Li Zhongying, were all sent to the Gendarmerie Headquarters. Following a resolution by the Central Standing Committee, they were transferred to the court for handling. The Capital District Court Procuratorate presented the case to the Supreme Court Procuratorate, which referred it to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate for investigation and ordered it to be handled according to law.</p>
<p>Evidence and Applicable Laws</p>
<p>The deceased Sun Fengming carried out the attack at the Central Party Headquarters and was apprehended on the spot. Central Committee member Zhang Ji described the details very clearly during the investigations by the Supreme Court Prosecutor and the Capital District Court Prosecutor (see Supreme Court Prosecutor's file and Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, page 85). The President of the Executive Yuan's injuries were also assessed by the Central Hospital, and an assessment report is attached to the file (see Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, page 38). There is no doubt that Sun Fengming was the person who fired the shots in this case. After being arrested, Defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang stated at the Gendarmerie Headquarters how they were ideologically left-leaning, how they had joined the Communist Party's Social League and the Workers' Education League, how they had listened to Hua Kezhi and were instructed by Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Wang Yaqiao to jointly organize the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating key figures in the central government, how they had divided the work, how they had arranged the implementation, and how Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Wang Yaqiao, and others had taken the initiative, provided economic support, and directed the operation (see Gendarmerie Headquarters' record of confessions and the defendants' confessions). Subsequently, during the investigation, they repeatedly confessed to the same facts (see interrogation records of the Capital District Court Procuratorate and the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate). Although they ultimately refused to admit that the purpose of the plan to harm key responsible figures in the central government was to disrupt the security of the central and local governments, reviewing the interrogation records of the Capital District Court Procuratorate reveals that Zhang Yuhua confessed that they (referring to Chen and Li) were fighting for political territory. The most important people in the current central government are Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang. If they can achieve the goal of assassinating them, the local security will inevitably be disrupted, and politics will fall into a state of chaos. Chen, Li, and others can take this opportunity to restore their political status. This is what they mean by calling us out to organize. (see Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, number 196) He Puguang confessed that the target was first to assassinate Chiang, and second to assassinate Wang. If neither goal can be achieved, then create a major disturbance. The original intention of assassinating Wang was because they were the most important figures in the current government, that is, political rivals of Chen and Li. If the goal of assassination could be achieved, local security would be disrupted, and there would be no key figures in the government to preside over it. Li, Chen, and others could take this opportunity to restore their political status. Therefore, Zhang Yuhua's advocacy of a major disturbance was also because if a situation of disturbance was discovered in the security situation, there would be an opportunity to take advantage of it. I also agreed with this statement at the meeting. (see Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, page 153, page 154). The defendants have clearly confessed that they knew that Chen, Li, and others took the initiative to harm key responsible figures in the central government, and that their intention was to disrupt the security of the central and local governments in order to create an opportunity to seize national territory and undermine unification again. How can they deny it now? Regardless of whether the defendants have other intentions, under the direction of Chen, Li, and Wang, they were clearly aware that their intention was to disrupt the security of the central and local governments, and yet they still listened to and implemented the plan by organizing agencies and engaging in covering up assassinations. The evidence is clear and there is no doubt. Defendant Liu Shurong confessed that he was aware of the plan and listened to it at the Chenguang News Agency, helping with news gathering and participating in the discussions. Li Huaicheng and Xiang Zhonglin participated in the discussions and encouraged Sun Fengming. Xiang Zhonglin also provided subsidies for the agency's activities and helped obtain entry permits. When questioned, the defendants all stated that this was true. Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, and Liu Shurong all confessed that the defendants were indeed aware of and sympathetic to the plan (see Gendarmerie Headquarters' record of confessions, page 13, page 20, page 32, page 51, Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, page 201, Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's file, page 47). Lu Qingqi admitted that he had stored a handgun for Zhang Yuhua for several days in September of last year (24th year), but argued that it was all out of friendship and that he was unaware of the plan. However, when questioned, Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, and Liu Shurong all stated that the defendant was indeed aware of and involved in the plan. Zhang Yuhua also stated that the defendant already knew the contents of the plan not long after Yin and others started the news agency (see Gendarmerie Headquarters' record of confessions, page 111, page 116, page 135, confession, page 113, page 51, Capital District Court Prosecutor's file, page 301, Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's file, page 47). After the agency's second plan failed, it was the defendant who sent a telegram to inform them of the news. There are also repeated confessions from Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang that can be relied upon (see Gendarmerie Headquarters' record of confessions, page 131, confession, page 12, page 37, Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's file, page 45, page 67). Therefore, how can he use empty words such as being completely unaware of the plan to try to evade responsibility? In summary, the person directing and managing the publication of articles was Wang Yaqiao, the person who listened to and carried out the act of murder was Sun Fengming, and the defendants Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi were either the people who organized the agency and assumed overall responsibility, or were only people who participated in the discussions, encouraged the implementation, stored murder weapons, subsidized activities, and helped obtain entry permits and other parts of the work. The ultimate goal of their entire behavior was to disrupt the security of the central and local governments for Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others to create an opportunity to seize national territory and undermine unification again. Their behavior of organizing agencies and shooting people was only one method for their attempt to disrupt security. Defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang, listening to the instructions of Chen, Li, and Wang, assumed overall responsibility and implemented the organization of agencies and engaged in covering up assassinations in order to realize the disruption of security in the central and local governments. This is inherently a crime of colluding with traitors to disrupt security with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, violating Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China. Their methods of attempted murder are also crimes under Article 271, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. However, the crime of attempted murder is lighter than the crime of endangering the Republic of China. According to Article 55 of the Criminal Law, they should be punished for the heavier crime of endangering the Republic of China. Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi only participated in some of the work related to the murder, and their circumstances are lighter than those of Zhang and He. However, considering the entire conspiracy to disrupt security in this case, the defendants' actions are indeed involved in the planning and execution of the disruption of security, and they belong to the acts that constitute the elements of the crime in the implementation of the crime. They should also be considered co-offenders and punished according to the aforementioned laws. Zhang Yuhua once joined the Communist Party's Social League and served as a district committee member. He Puguang once joined the Communist Party's Social League and the Workers' Education League. They should also be held responsible for violating Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China for organizing a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China. Except for Guo Zhimou, Guo Fei, Zhou Xiling, Wu Huang, and Li Zhongying, who are not sufficiently suspected of committing a crime and will be granted a separate decision not to prosecute, this indictment is filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China and Article 230, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Division of the same branch. Prosecutor Luo Renji, February 27th, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River in Shandong Province - The Dongzhuang Closure Confluence</h3>
<p>—A Complete Success at 7 PM on the 27th—</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: After the loss of the sunken ship in the Dongzhuang closure of the Yellow River on the 26th, the mooring pillows were continuously thrown to abandon the method of sunken ship confluence. However, after the sunken ship, the water depth at the mouth of the gap decreased from 10 meters to 7 meters, and the situation improved. Work continued throughout the night and by 10:00 AM on the 27th, the water depth at the mouth of the gap was 6 meters. At 3:00 PM, the depth was 4.5 meters. By 4:00 PM, the mouth of the gap was narrower, only 2 meters, and the water depth was no more than 4 meters. At 12:00 noon, the flow rate at the mouth of the gap was 80 cubic meters per second. At 3:00 PM, it was 40 cubic meters per second. At 4:00 PM, it was 31 cubic meters. At 5:40 PM, the two dams of willow pillows were connected together. At 6:00 PM, a layer of willow was pressed, and it was completely out of the water. Immediately, sacks were rushed to press down, and at the same time, stones were thrown behind the mouth of the gap. Because of the availability of manpower and materials, and because the water势 at the mouth of the gap was weak, the great work was completed. It was exactly seven o'clock. The mouth of the gap continued to be pressed with sacks until 10:00 PM. The height of the water was one zhang, and the width was also one zhang.</p>
<p>It was found that at 10:00 AM on the 27th, the annual flow rate was measured at 840 cubic meters per second, and only 100 cubic meters per second passed through the mouth of the gap. The remaining 740 cubic meters per second flowed down the old river and the Da Yin River. By 6:00 PM, the entire river had 910 cubic meters per second, and the old river and the Yin River flowed 892 cubic meters per second. Only 18 cubic meters per second flowed through the mouth of the gap. After the confluence was completed that night, water still permeated under the mouth of the gap, but the amount was only a few cubic meters per second. According to this decision, the closure of the gap was completed more quickly than the confluence of Guantai Fenglou because the workers worked extraordinarily hard. Although water still passes under the mouth of the gap, this is a phenomenon that should occur at the beginning of the confluence. After being pressed firmly within days, the air tightness can be completed. Stone protection projects are now being rushed.</p>
<p>For several days, Kong Xiangrong, Acting Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, supervised the work in a simple tent on the riverbank. After the completion of the confluence of the Dongzhuang gap on the evening of the 27th, he returned to the office. At this time, the surrounding people were all on the river to visit and cheered together. Outside the office door, there was a slogan that read "Celebrating Chairman Kong's Completion of the Great Work of Closing the Dongzhuang Yellow River". Kong immediately gathered the people in front of the office and gave a speech, saying that the completion of the closure of the gap was not the effort of Xiangrong alone, but the result of the timing, geography, and the harmony of the people. The staff worked day and night and worked hard, which is admirable. The Yellow River Commission is worried about the worries of the people and happy about the happiness of the people. We will continue to work hard, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, departed from Jinan for the upper reaches on the 26th and arrived at Dongzhuang on the 27th. Zhang personally visited the work site during the confluence. After the work was completed, he immediately telegraphed the provincial government in Dongzhuang.

The curtain will be closed within days. Respectfully reported. Your subordinate Zhang Lianjia kowtows."</p>
<h3>The Power of Taiwanese People in Xiamen - Recent Survey of Xiamen's Population - Taiwanese Industry Reaches Over 20 Million</h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The Xiamen Municipal Public Security Bureau announced on March 28th the latest survey of the city's population. It was conducted by the chiefs of each branch bureau, and police officers, checking each household in detail from the beginning of March until the 27th. According to the statistics of the household registration office, there are a total of 33,059 households in the city, with a total of 100,9368 males and 77,603 females. The analysis is as follows: 24,678 residents, 2,491 shops, 3,178 combined households, 347 public households, 10,3681 temples and monasteries, 73,498 female residents, 1,553 male students, 1,034 female students, 4,667 strong men, 228 male party members, 25 female party members, 66,002 literate men, 25,657 literate women, 29,691 illiterate men, 42,457 illiterate women, 45,959 employed men, 3,198 employed women, 9,167 unemployed men, 28,573 unemployed women, 6,447 unemployed men, 44 unemployed women, 4,154 male lodgers, 1,275 female lodgers, 31 foreign resident households, 32 shops, 13 combined households, 127 male residents, 52 female residents, 1,205 foreign nationals resident households, 553 shops, 428 combined households, 5,560 male residents, 4,055 female residents, totaling 33,059 households, 109,368 males, 77,605 females, totaling 186,973 people. According to the survey, the foreign national population, with the exception of a very small number of British, Americans, French, Dutch, and Portuguese, are overwhelmingly Japanese Taiwanese. Regarding shops, according to a recent survey by the Japanese Consulate, there are 9,000 Taiwanese people registered at the consulate in Xiamen, with over 400 shops. However, according to the estimates of the Taiwan Xinmin Daily, there are 15,500 Taiwanese people in Xiamen. There are still many who have not registered with the Japanese consulate. The Public Security Bureau's survey of the foreign national population is largely consistent with the Japanese Consulate, as it is based on those who have registered with the consulate and registered their nationality with the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the figure of 15,500 people has no formal statistical basis. According to the Taiwan Xinmin Daily and the Japanese Consulate's survey of Taiwanese residents in Xiamen, there are over 400 shops, and the annual trade volume reaches 20 million. The movable and immovable property of Taiwanese people in Xiamen amounts to over 26 million, which also shows their power in Xiamen. (March 29th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Actively Engaged in Rural Revitalization, Establishing Rural Loans, and Improving Agricultural Techniques</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province has abundant agricultural products, and the increase or decrease in production and sales volume, as well as appropriate adjustments of rice and tea, are sufficient to affect the national economy and people's livelihood. In recent years, the central economic construction agencies and the Anhui Provincial Government have been in contact, and both have been devoting all their efforts to the work of rural revitalization. The following is a record of the most recent important initiatives being undertaken. It is expected that in three to five years, the establishment of rural economic governance and the improvement of agricultural production throughout the province will have a great impact.</p>
<p>Central Bank and Other Banks Offer Loans</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Anhui Rural Cooperative Committee has introduced bank loans for rural cooperative undertakings, allowing urban capital to circulate within the countryside and increasing its productivity. The Farmers Bank of China has long lent large sums of money to rural areas. Last year, through the efforts of the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Bank of China established rural cooperative loans in Wuhu, Fanchang, Dangtu, Hexian, and Xuancheng counties. In the past year, the results have been very significant, and the loans have been recovered in accordance with regulations. Recently, the Bank has again agreed to the Cooperative Committee's introduction and is conducting cooperative loan trials in Hanshan and Lujiang counties in central Anhui. Personnel have been dispatched, including Qian Mengling, to conduct on-the-ground surveys of each district to determine whether cooperative organizations in each area are sound, so that loans can benefit farmers and be fully guaranteed when recovered. This survey work has now been completed, and preparations are being made in accordance with the Bank's headquarters' intention. If progress is smooth, the program will be gradually expanded to meet needs. As for the cooperation between the Bank of Communications and the Anhui Provincial Bank to lend 500,000 yuan in tea loans in Qimen, both parties have now established offices in Qimen and are engaged in preparations. Wu Linbo, a former employee of the Bank of Communications headquarters in Shanghai, arrived in Wuhu yesterday to discuss all matters with the Anhui Provincial Bank. Loans will begin in the shortest possible time to help revitalize Qimen tea.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Company Improves Rice Seeds</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company, in order to increase the agricultural production along the Anhui South railway line, thereby promoting its transportation business, has established an agricultural improvement field in Xuancheng and is cooperating technically with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry. The first step is to focus on improving rice seeds, with wheat and rapeseed as supplements. It has also jointly established a promotion committee with the Xuancheng County Government and has selected Sunjiabu as the first year's promotion area, with a total of 415 farming households and a registered planting area of 6,000 mu. In order to expand this work and further cooperate with the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, demonstration farmland areas have been established in ten stations along the railway line with abundant grain production, including Cihu, Caishi, Dangtu, Daqiao, Kazikou, Zhusigang, Wanzhi, and Qiaotou, to gradually implement the program and achieve significant results.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Land Reporting Begins</p>
<p>Land reporting is extremely important for local administration and the organization of agricultural land. The successful trials in Dangtu and Hexian counties in Anhui Province have already yielded significant results. Dangtu County alone has increased the number of cultivated fields by more than 300,000 mu. As a result, various provinces have successively sent personnel to the county for on-site reference, using it as a model. The Anhui Provincial Government has now begun the second phase of land reporting, which is divided into reporting and surveying. Reporting has been designated for Hefei, Chuxian, Sixian, Wuwei, and Fengyang counties. Surveying has been designated for Fuyang, Linquan, Yingshang, and Taihe counties. The Provincial Land Bureau has trained 300 people from Fuyang for this work, dividing them into nine groups and forty-one teams to begin the work. Because the Fuyang area is the largest, the surveying work must be completed within 83 days, after which the reporting will continue.</p>
<p>Frequent Robberies Reported in South Pudong</p>
<p>Songjiang: Insecurity persists in the Pudong area, and robbery cases are frequently heard. Late at night on the 27th, at 4th Jia in Tinglin, two bandits armed with sharp knives and flashlights broke open a back window and entered the bedroom of Mao Wu, a ritual professional. Mao and others shouted for help, and his wife, Lu, was stabbed in the right arm and had her gold earrings torn off, bleeding profusely. Afraid to shout again, she allowed the bandits to loot the house and leave through the front door.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Soil Seized and Escorted for Investigation</h3>
<p>Gu Shijia, the chief of smuggled soil investigation in Songjiang County, received a tip that Sun Shisheng in Fengjing East Market was suspected of selling smuggled soil. On the morning of the 29th, he rushed to search and seized 53 bags of smuggled soil. Sun Shisheng (62 years old) and his daughter, Huang Yongling (35 years old, already married), were escorted to the county. Because it was a holiday that day, they were ordered to be imprisoned and awaiting interrogation.</p>
<p>Silk and Foreign Cloth Businesses Selling at Low Prices</p>
<p>Suzhou: The Suzhou Silk and Foreign Cloth Business Associations, in view of the major disputes arising from low-price competition in the Shanghai silk industry, and considering the current rise in silk prices, which makes low-price sales particularly disadvantageous, specially convened representatives of the two industries for discussion. A unanimous resolution was passed to stop low-price sales, and it was stipulated that new stores would only be allowed to sell at low prices for three days. Unexpectedly, due to different circumstances, opinions among the stores differed. Jiuda and others outside Xumen were the first to violate the resolution and advertised low-price sales. Therefore, Shenyu and five other stores outside Banmen also began to sell at low prices from the 20th. Stores on Guanqian Street will also start selling at low prices simultaneously on April 1st, completely overturning the industry's resolution.</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigate Embezzlement Case of Opium Paste Company</h3>
<p>The County Government received a provincial order the other day that the Suzhou Rongda, Baotai, and Laoqia opium paste companies were found to have illegally raised opium prices and engaged in fraudulent activities, amounting to more than 70,000 yuan. It was ordered to strictly investigate the matter. County Magistrate Deng summoned and arrested Sun Yubiao, the manager of Baotai, and Li Guitang, the manager of Rongda. However, Liu Zheran, the manager of Laoqia, had already disappeared upon hearing the news. Sun Yunxia, a commissioner of the county, advocated strict handling of the case. However, Sun Jinbiao and others argued that the increase in opium paste prices had been approved by the County Government, so they specially submitted a presentation to the Department of Civil Affairs on the 29th to defend themselves. It is faintly heard that the case involves many parties, and Wu Qiyun, the former County Magistrate of Wu County who has already left office, also has considerable involvement. Therefore, the society is paying close attention to this case.</p>
<p>Wuxi: A Young Man Flees to Die</p>
<p>Wu Yansheng, a 20-year-old native of Jiangyin, an employee of the cashiers department of the Yu Kang Yarn Factory in Jiangyin Alley, Wuxi, has been working in Wuxi for two years and has been quite diligent in his duties. He is highly regarded by the factory. Last summer, Wu attended the provincial Bao Yan Civil School on Ma Road to study in the junior high school class. He met a female friend, Gu Yingxia. The two developed from classmates to lovers and discussed marriage. Wu's father had deep family values and expressed dissatisfaction with the marriage. Wu was pessimistic due to the lack of freedom in marriage and was often sentimental. At 7 a.m. the other day, Wu discovered that the iron box he was responsible for keeping had been stolen, containing 2,000 yuan in legal tender. The loss of such a large sum of money caused a major blow to Wu's spirit. He suddenly left during the afternoon of the other day, his whereabouts unknown. Before leaving, he wrote a letter to a friend, saying that he intended to bury his body in the scenic Suzhou. However, his family went to Suzhou to search everywhere without success and advertised for his return without success. The family is at a loss and anxious day and night. Wu's whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>American Silk Tycoon Mr. and Mrs. Ganli Arrive in Wuxi for Inspection</h3>
<p>American silk tycoon Mr. Ganli and his wife arrived in China on the 25th of this month aboard the Chichibu Maru. They were warmly welcomed by the Chinese silk industry in Shanghai. Yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Ganli, at the invitation of Xue Shouyun, a silk magnate in Wuxi, accompanied by silk expert Miao Chanxiu and others, took an early train from Shanghai to Wuxi yesterday morning. After arriving, they boarded Xue's pre-hired houseboat and sailed to Li Garden, Yuantouzhu, Mei Garden, Huishan, and other scenic spots for sightseeing. They returned to the city at 2 p.m. and then visited the six silk factories founded by Xue, including Yongtai and Huaxin in the South Gate, Yongshun and Longchang in the East Gate, and Jinji and Minfeng in the West Gate, for inspection. They inquired in detail about various equipment, technologies, and businesses. Mr. and Mrs. Ganli expressed their admiration for Mr. Xue's perseverance and simple entrepreneurial spirit. At 8 p.m. that night, they took a special express train back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Water and Land Police Forces Gather for Inspection</p>
<p>Nantong: The spring inspection of the Jiangsu Provincial Water and Land Public Security Police Force is being held in districts. The police force in the Nantong District, including Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing counties, will gather in Nantong. On April 15th, the inspection will be conducted by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs' Police Inspector, together with Ge Tan, the Fourth District Security Commander.</p>
<h3>Liuqiao Bandit Robbery Injures People</h3>
<p>In Xuetang Township, Liuqiao District, a large group of bandits led by Wang suddenly arrived, robbing the homes of Si Wenxue and others, and shooting and injuring many victims. The police force rushed to the scene upon learning of the incident, but the bandits had already fled with the stolen goods.</p>
<p>City Government Offers Reward for Hunting Tigers</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, in response to news reports that tigers had been found in the Wuchao Mountains in the urban area and had eaten people, decided that this was related to public security. He specially offered a reward to encourage hunters. For each tiger hunted in the mountains of the urban area, a reward of 100 yuan will be given; for each leopard, 50 yuan. The city government will also present a letter of encouragement. Zhejiang Province riders and hunters are currently planning a group hunting method.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevalent in Linpu</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: The climate has been abnormal recently, with sudden cold and hot spells. A disease similar to meningitis has recently been found in the Chi Hou Kong area near Linpu in the region, spreading throughout the area and becoming very rampant. It starts with headaches and fever, and death occurs within two days. In the past week, the number of deaths has reached thirty or forty, mostly children. The hospitals are crowded, and they are overwhelmed. The County Hospital has already sent people to investigate and find ways to treat the disease.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Discusses Draft Constitution, to Be Announced on May 5th, National Assembly to Be Convened as Scheduled, Organization and Election Laws to Be Passed by End of April</h3>

Mr. Wang's nasal condition has gradually improved and he should be discharged from the hospital in one or two days. He will leave Shanghai for Beijing to meet with Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan and others to discuss everything. At that time, he may return to Beijing with them. As for the rumors that he is going south, they are purely speculative and unfounded.</p>

<h3>Two Concessions Interfere with Aviation Donation, Resolved After Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association has been conducting an aviation patriotic fundraising campaign in Shanghai for more than a year. With the support of all parties, it has been progressing smoothly and has achieved significant results. Recently, the authorities of the two special districts had a misunderstanding regarding the fundraising methods for the aviation donation from the travel industry, and there were incidents of interference with fundraising and confiscation of receipts and books, which aroused the indignation of the Association and various industries and people from all walks of life. This is purely an expression of patriotism by our people, and the fundraising is done voluntarily by Chinese people. Foreigners should not interfere. After the Association sent letters to the authorities of the two special districts for negotiation, the French Concession authorities have already replied to the Association and announced in the newspaper that they will not interfere with or restrict people's voluntary donations. The Public Concession authorities also stated yesterday that they will not obstruct aviation donations and will allow voluntary donations. They have never objected to it. It is heard that the Association has formally sent a letter to the authorities of the district, requesting them to order their subordinates to give strong support and return all the confiscated books and other items in order to settle accounts and facilitate collection. They also hope that if any incidents occur in the future, they will be notified in advance so that the Association can handle them and avoid incidents. As for the improper procedures currently being carried out in the collection work, Li Dachao, the Executive Director of the Association, and others are earnestly drafting specific points for correction and improvement in consultation with the various industry associations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Farmers Bank Ordered to Handle Fishery Loans, Now Decided to Focus on Aiding Rural Areas in Northwest Frontier, Branches and Cooperatives to Be Established in Early April</h3>
<p>The Chinese Farmers Bank, after receiving an order from the Ministry to issue 100 million yuan in legal tender, with 50 million yuan invested in rural loans and land mortgages, has been actively carrying out the work and has decided to focus on aiding rural areas in the Northwest frontier. It has now received another order to handle fishery loans. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter will report the details as follows:</p>
<p>Focus on Lending to Rural Areas in Frontier</p>
<p>After the Bank received an order to handle agricultural loans and mortgages with 50 million yuan, the Agricultural Survey Department of the head office sent investigators to South China, North China, Central China, and other places to conduct thorough investigations of agricultural conditions. The results showed that in the prosperous areas and major urban centers of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, other banks were already handling loans, and there was no need for further expansion. It has now been decided to focus on aiding the rural areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, and other remote provinces. Personnel have been sent to inspect local conditions and prepare to establish branches, offices, and agricultural lending cooperatives. The first to be handled will be Sichuan Province. The branches in the province will be established in early April and will begin to provide rural loans.</p>
<p>Ordered to Handle Fishery Loans</p>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Industry, previously rejecting the request of fishing merchants to issue fishery public bonds, allowed the Chinese Farmers Bank to handle loans. The fishing merchants have repeatedly requested that it be implemented as soon as possible. The Ministry of Finance has specially ordered the Bank to prepare and implement the loans. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Bank originally intended to establish fishery lending cooperatives in coastal areas. However, since the Bank has no branches in various fishing areas, and the fishing season is approaching, even if it is established immediately, it is practically too late. Therefore, it is now considering easier ways to implement the loans, or to allocate a certain amount of cash for this loan assistance. Once the plan is decided, loans will be implemented in the various coastal fishing areas to support our country's fisheries.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Current Figures</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chen Jie, Jiao Yitang, Zou Lin, Peng Xuepei, and others all took the 11 p.m. express train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>German Residents in Shanghai Hold Mock Election: 97.7% of Votes Cast Express Confidence in the Government; Total Voter Turnout Exceeds 97% of All German Residents</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yesterday was the day of the German parliamentary elections. German residents in Shanghai held a mock election at the German School on Route Ferguson. According to German election law, overseas residents must vote on a German ship at least three miles from the coast of another country for the vote to be valid; otherwise, it is void. German residents in Shanghai had originally planned to hire a German ship to sail three miles outside Wusongkou to hold the election. However, as there were no German warships or ships docked in Shanghai yesterday, the election was temporarily moved to the German School as a mock election, merely to show the German residents in Shanghai's support for their leader Hitler's policies.</p>
<p>From eight o'clock yesterday morning, German residents, both men and women, arrived to participate. There were no special arrangements in the school. The walls were covered with photographs of Hitler and various German slogans. Boy and girl scouts from the school stood guard at the gate to maintain order. Two German flags with black swastikas on a red background flew high above the playground, exuding a calm and dignified spirit. The German Consul-General in Shanghai, Kriebel, also wore a party uniform with a short knife at his waist, running around and giving instructions. Before the meeting began, the boy and girl scouts cheered and sang. Groups of German residents discussed European politics. The warm sunlight shone on their cheerful faces, and a radio broadcast the German national anthem, its rising and falling tones matching their solemn and majestic expressions. Members of the National Socialist Party wore yellow uniforms with swastika armbands, creating a harmonious scene. Standing in the field, the reporter could not help but feel a sense of awe and respect. Patriotic fervor surged like a torrent that could not be contained. As the clock struck ten, precisely on time, Consul-General Kriebel announced the commencement of a simple election ceremony. The venue immediately fell silent. The National Socialist Party members were first inspected, and then, under the leadership of the Consul-General, the German party anthem was sung. The Consul-General gave a speech and performed the National Socialist salute. At 10:20, the simple ceremony concluded, and people went upstairs to vote. The Germans are direct and efficient, unwilling to waste time or resources. Even in the smallest details, they fully demonstrate their practicality, hard work, perseverance, and indomitable spirit, which are truly the factors behind the success of the Germanic people.</p>
<p>The polling station was located on the second floor of the school. The ballot read, "German Residents of Shanghai Election, March 29, 1936. German men and women, do you agree with the current policies of the German government?" Below the question were two circles, with the words "Yes" and "No" printed inside. Voters could cross out whichever word they did not agree with. Those who agreed crossed out the word "No". Voting began at 10:20 AM and ended at 6:00 PM. The results of the count showed a total of 1,191 votes cast, including 1,165 votes of confidence, 16 votes of no confidence, and 11 invalid votes. Proportionally, the total number of votes cast accounted for 97.16% of all German residents, votes of confidence accounted for 97.7%, votes of no confidence accounted for 1.3%, and invalid votes accounted for 1%. At 7:00 PM, Consul-General Kriebel took the stage to announce the results to the public and immediately telegraphed his report to the government in Germany, expressing the enthusiasm of the German residents in Shanghai in supporting the government's policies. Consul-General Kriebel's speech yesterday was as follows, in essence: "I must first thank you all for coming to participate in the voting. At the same time, we can imagine that the voters in our country are also expressing their support and firm belief in the various political decisions made by our leader. The German people in this city, like their compatriots at home, are taking the same action. This decision is still a pioneering one, but because we are situated in an outer area, this action cannot be counted. However, its effect in expressing faith is the same. Our leader and compatriots can see that although we are in the Far East, we are not estranged from the entire country. You should all know the arms restrictions imposed on our country by the Treaty of Versailles. All the demands of the German leader and people are for peace, strictness, and freedom. You should all also know that our leader only knows how to go deep into the hearts of the people to seek peace for Germany and even the world. Therefore, I ask you to clarify this point before entering the voting booth."</p>

<h3>Bank of Communications to Handle Qimen Tea Loans: Provisional Measures Established</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, after the Bank of Communications and the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm established a loan contract, the bank also has 20 provisional measures. They are recorded below: "Provisional Measures for Short-Term Loans for Tea Production and Sales Cooperation in Qimen on a Trial Basis by the Bank of Communications."</p>
<p>I. This bank has specially initiated short-term loans for tea production and sales cooperation in Qimen this year on a trial basis, in order to promote the revival of tea trade and improve the economic situation of tea farmers.</p>
<p>II. The tea production and sales cooperation short-term loans implemented by this bank in Qimen on a trial basis are temporarily limited to well-organized cooperative societies guided by the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm.</p>
<p>III. When the cooperative society applies to this bank for loans for tea production and sales, it must first obtain a formal letter of introduction from the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm. After being approved by this bank, it can handle loan procedures in accordance with all the procedures stipulated by this bank.</p>
<p>IV. The amount of loans applied for by the cooperative society to this bank may be increased or decreased as appropriate, or refused to be loaned, according to the actual needs.</p>
<p>V. The short-term loans for tea production and sales cooperation implemented by this bank in Qimen on a trial basis are temporarily limited to the following two types:</p>
<p>A. Production loans: The number of refined tea boxes that all members of the cooperative society can produce from their own tea leaves is taken as the standard (the above number of boxes must be certified by the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm and approved by this bank). Each box of refined tea (the net weight should be full of 45 catties on average according to the Qimen original large scale). The maximum amount should not exceed 25 yuan. The regulations for the use and payment of loans are as follows: First installment: 5 yuan in legal tender per box is pre-paid as a deposit for tea workers and to purchase firewood, charcoal, and box materials, which will be loaned out before a certain date in a certain month. Third installment: approximately 8 to 12 yuan in legal tender per box is pre-paid for purchasing tea leaf picking and manufacturing tools, etc., which will be loaned out before a certain date in a certain month. Third installment: Approximately 9 to 11 yuan in legal tender per box is pre-paid to pay wages, which will be loaned out from a certain date in a certain month to a certain date in a certain month.</p>
<p>B. Transportation and sales loans: The refined tea produced by the cooperative society should be sent to the Qimen Office of this bank. Each box of refined tea (including by-products, about 15 to 25 boxes for every 100 boxes of refined tea) will be valued at a maximum of 60 yuan, and a loan will be granted at 70% of the price. After deducting the principal and interest of the production loan that has been loaned out, as well as the tea tax, transportation fee, insurance, warehouse rent, customs declaration, handling fee, and other miscellaneous expenses, the balance must be used after the cooperative society has paid all the pre-determined number of refined tea and by-product boxes. (6) The refined tea and by-products ordered by the cooperative society from this bank for transportation and sales loans shall be transported and sold by the transportation and sales agency entrusted by the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm. All tea money obtained from the sale shall be collected by this bank on its behalf. After the sale is completely completed, the tea price obtained, in addition to the principal and interest of the transportation and sales loan and other various expenses deducted by this bank, if there is a surplus, the bank will jointly with the transportation and sales agency, calculate clearly according to the original number of refined tea boxes paid by the company, and remit them to the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm, which will transfer them to the directors and supervisors of the company, who will be responsible for receiving them. If there is a shortfall, the directors and supervisors of the company must also be required to make up for the shortfall. All remittance handling fees for the return of surplus and the replenishment of shortfalls shall be borne by the company itself.</p>
<p>VII. The term and interest rate of the short-term loans for tea production and sales cooperation implemented by this bank on a trial basis are as follows:</p>
<p>A. The production loan is limited to three months, from the date of signing the contract to the date of the scheduled repayment, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent, calculated on a daily basis.</p>
<p>B. The transportation and sales loan is limited to five months, from the date of signing the contract to the date of the scheduled repayment, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent, calculated on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The above interest shall be calculated from the date of payment to the day before the repayment, based on the actual amount used.</p>
<p>VIII. All types of loans must be repaid in full with principal and interest upon maturity, and no arrears are allowed. If events occur that are beyond human resistance, making it impossible to repay on time, the directors and supervisors of the company should immediately submit a letter stating the facts and explaining the reasons. After this bank verifies that the facts are true, an extension may be granted once, up to a maximum of two months. The interest that has become due shall still be settled on time. The extended interest rate shall be calculated by adding 4% to the original interest rate.</p>
<p>IX. If the number of refined tea and by-product boxes that the cooperative society pre-ordered for transportation and sales cannot be fully paid upon maturity, the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm shall notify this bank. This bank shall then deduct the principal and interest of the production loan for the short-handed portion from the unused amount of the transportation and sales loan that has been paid for refined tea and by-products. If it is still insufficient, the directors and supervisors of the company must be held liable for compensation. If the number of refined tea boxes delivered by the cooperative society exceeds the pre-determined number of boxes, the loan may be used according to the circumstances. Each box shall not exceed half of the original price of 60 yuan.</p>
<p>X. The interest on the money loaned by this bank to the cooperative society and then loaned by the cooperative society to its members shall not exceed 4% of the original interest rate of this bank's loan to the cooperative society.</p>

<p>XII. When the cooperative society withdraws production loans and transportation and sales loans in each period, the company shall issue a formal receipt, signed and sealed by more than three people, including the chairman of the board, the chairman of the supervisory board, and the treasurer. It must also obtain a certificate from the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm, and then this bank will verify that the seals are correct before the money can be withdrawn.</p>
<p>XIII. After each loan from this bank has been certified by the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm and the cooperative society has issued a formal receipt for collection, all responsibilities shall be borne by the cooperative society itself, and this bank shall have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>XIV. The cooperative society that this bank lends to must be visited by a member of this bank at any time to investigate the company's affairs and business, as well as to audit the accounts. The company shall not shirk or refuse.</p>
<p>XV. The directors, supervisors, and members of the company to which this bank lends shall be jointly and severally liable while the company's debt to this bank has not been settled. After the employees of the company retire, their outstanding procedures shall still be the responsibility of their successors. XVI. Return a part or all of the loan at any time, but each repayment must be at least 50 yuan. This bank shall issue a formal receipt as proof. When all the loans of the company have been repaid, the original loan contract may be revoked based on the formal receipt of this bank. Those who repay in advance will not have their interest reduced. XVII. If the cooperative society that borrowed the loan does not comply with the guidance of the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm, or changes the use specified in the original loan contract, or if there are other irregular circumstances, and this bank confirms the facts, it may at any time recover part or all of the loan from the directors and supervisors of the company. XVIII. If there are any matters not stipulated in these measures, they shall be handled separately in accordance with the regulations for handling agricultural cooperation loans of this bank. XIX. These measures may be amended by this bank at any time. XX. These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the head office.</p>

<p>I. Regarding the regulations on various etiquette for weddings, funerals, and sacrifices, and the method of restricting lavish banquets and entertainment, hand it over to the Ministries of Interior and Finance to discuss and determine the method.</p>
<p>II. Regarding the property of temples and ancestral halls, it should be protected in accordance with the principle of religious freedom.

<p>Item 8: Utilize abandoned land. It is proposed that the government find ways to utilize abandoned land for cultivation, afforestation, and animal husbandry. Hand it over to the Ministries of Interior, Industry, and Finance to discuss and determine the method.</p>
<p>Item 9: Properly plan a method for balancing international trade. It is proposed to pass it, but the International Trade Bureau does not need to be reorganized. Hand it over to the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs to properly discuss a plan for swift implementation.</p>
<p>Item 10: Unify state-run enterprises. It is proposed to pass it.</p>
<p>Item 11: Adopt a conscription system. It is proposed to pass it and hand it over to the Ministries of Industry and Finance to discuss and implement it.

<h3>Iranian Consul General Ostovan Discusses Impressions of Nanjing and Sino-Iranian Relations: Future Must Include Regular Visits Between Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Mr. Ostovan, the Consul General of Iran stationed in Shanghai, has been in office in Shanghai for two years. Mr. Ostovan was recently promoted to Consul General, in charge of all Iranian overseas affairs in China, and also handles diplomatic affairs. He recently went to Nanjing to visit Foreign Minister Zhang and has returned to Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the Iranian consulate yesterday and had a long conversation. Here is a record of his remarks: The impression I got from my visit to Nanjing this time was excellent. Geographically, Nanjing is the central area of China, located on the right bank of the Yangtze River, with abundant resources. In terms of national defense, there is the Yangtze River in front, surrounded by small mountains, which is quite dangerous. The climate is hotter in summer, but there are many Yangtze River flows and lakes in Nanjing. If scientific methods are applied, it is definitely possible to change its heat. The streets of Nanjing are wide and clean, and all construction is on the rise. This is enough to prove the efforts of your government. Also, the construction of the Foreign Ministry building has recently been completed. Its structure and shape are purely modern art. As for the construction of private buildings, such as the Capital Hotel, the equipment is perfect and the hospitality is considerate, which makes foreigners very satisfied. It is said that your government plans to build a funicular railway similar to that in Hong Kong, which will run directly from the city to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, so that people in the city can escape the summer heat in the mountains. This is truly a good deed. I have visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Before I left Shanghai, I prepared a well-made wreath with the Iranian national emblem (green, white, and red horizontal lines) to offer my respects to the tomb of this great Mr. Sun Yat-sen. I have repeatedly read Mr. Sun Yat-sen's writings, which have made me extremely admire him. I was also grateful to Foreign Minister Zhang for his kindness in sending the Deputy Director of the Protocol Department to accompany me to visit the mausoleum and present flowers. I admire Minister Zhang very much. Not only can he fully understand all internal affairs issues in China, but he can also clearly understand international politics without any omissions. The two deputy ministers, the director of the General Affairs Department, and other officials are also very capable. It is commonplace for them to be able to do their best to entertain with international etiquette and to be proficient in several languages. Then the reporter asked for his opinion on the relations between China and Iran. Mr. Ostovan replied that the relations between China and Iran have been extremely friendly for centuries, as evidenced by the history of China and Iran. China and Iran can be called good friends. Our friendship and the economies of the two countries will naturally increase day by day. Mr. Ostovan also praised China's road facilities, saying that the railway organization is very good. The smoothness and speed of the trains, the cleanliness inside the cars, the thoughtfulness of the service, and the neatness inside and outside the stations are all in order. The accuracy of the train travel time is sufficient to express the new life movement in China. China has great hopes under the leadership of General Chiang. Mr. Ostovan said at the end that although my office is located in Shanghai, my job is in all of China, so I will often travel between Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>

He Zhenya presided over the meeting, reported on the significance of the social gathering, and introduced Mr. Tong Degan's lecture.</p>
<p>Lecture on Sino-Austrian Relations</p>
<p>Invited Mr. Tong Degan to lecture on Sino-Austrian relations, saying, "Today, this is a social tea party organized by the Sino-Austrian Committee of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the Austrian Consul General in Shanghai, Ogmeler, and Mr. He Zhenya. Degan is honored to be invited to attend this grand event. Sino-Austrian relations are extremely close, for nine reasons:</p>
<p>I. Assimilation of many different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>II. High culture.</p>
<p>III. Thick-heartedness and harmony.</p>
<p>IV. Appeasement policy.</p>
<p>V. Subjected to unequal treaty treatment and oppression by the great powers.</p>
<p>VI. Related international status.</p>
<p>VII. Striving for survival.</p>
<p>VIII. No conflicts of rights and interests between China and Austria.</p>
<p>IX. China and Austria signed an equal and mutually beneficial treaty," etc.</p>
<p>Austrian Consul General's Thank-You Speech</p>
<p>Invited Austrian Consul General Ogmeler to give a thank-you speech, saying, in brief, "I am very grateful to the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association for the reception today. Mr. Tong has been serving as the Chinese government's representative in Austria for the past six or seven years and has lived in Vienna for a long time. He is very familiar with the situation in Austria. After he said goodbye to Austria, the Austrians will definitely remember him often. He greatly admires the prime ministers of our two countries who have passed away, one is Sun Yat-sen, and the other is Dollfuss. He also greatly admires the current Austrian authorities. When Austria erected a monument to Dollfuss, he sent us a Chinese gong, and he sent it earlier than other countries, which shows that he attaches great importance to Austrian culture. Although he is a Far Easterner, he thoroughly understands the problems of the new Austria and the ideals of Austria. I firmly believe that all Austrians regret his departure from Austria very much. I hope he can still return to Austria recently, because his ideals are closely related to Austria and can best achieve the purpose of promoting Chinese culture in Austria. Austria is a center of culture and science and is most willing to have close relations with China, which has the oldest culture. Therefore, please do your best to help us achieve the goal of cooperation. On behalf of the Austrian people, I sincerely thank you and wish you complete success." Then, Luo Yimin (Austrian), a professor at Jiaotong University, gave a speech on the relationship between Sino-Austrian cultures. Finally, Jiang Kanghu, the chairman of the general assembly of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, gave a reply speech and the meeting dispersed.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui to be Discharged from Hospital Within Days; Scheduled to Go to Nanjing on the 2nd with Cheng Tiangu and Others</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, member of the Central Committee, resigned from his position as a judge of the International Court of Justice and returned to China to advocate national affairs and seek spiritual unity.

<h3>Provinces and Cities Urgently Request the Ministry of Finance to Provide Funds for the Exchange of Legal Tender; The Ministry of Finance May Provide Three Percent According to the Central Bank's Exchange Example</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that at the beginning of the implementation of the legal tender policy, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed various provincial and municipal governments to handle the exchange of legal tender and promised to provide an exchange fee of six percent of the total amount of silver coins exchanged. However, this was limited to the first phase of legal tender exchange (i.e., before February 3rd of this year) delivered to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The payment would be stopped after the deadline to conclude the matter. Now, various provincial and municipal governments have requested the Ministry of Finance to provide funds for the exchange of legal tender during the extended period, as the deadline for exchanging legal tender has been extended to May 3rd. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has handed this over to the Currency Department for review. The Central Bank has also written to the Ministry of Finance approving the dispatch of personnel to rural areas to exchange legal tender during the extended period. The Ministry of Finance has also agreed to pay an exchange fee of three percent for the exchange of legal tender by the Central Bank personnel. Therefore, the expenses required by various provinces and cities for handling the exchange of legal tender may also be changed to three percent, following the example of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>The Bank Acceptance House; Reviews the Bank Collateral of its Members; Discount Measures Are Formulated and Implemented Immediately; The Re-discount Principles of the Three Banks Have Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the establishment of the Shanghai Bank Acceptance House, there are a total of thirty-eight member banks, with an acceptance fund of 7,623,750 yuan and a total acceptance amount of 30,495,000 yuan. The public acceptance of member banks has been completed by the managers of each member bank and Zhu Boquan, the manager of the acceptance house. Now, the member banks have submitted goods, promissory notes, bills of exchange, valuable bonds, stocks, title deeds, etc., to the acceptance house for review. After the price is assessed and acceptance is approved, the two banks will fill out the acceptance forms and sign for acceptance. The acceptance house has formulated discount measures, which will be implemented immediately. The re-discount is handled by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The principles have been agreed upon, and the measures are being discussed. They will be decided and announced within days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approval; Measures for Dealing with Violations of Trade Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously requested instructions on how to deal with the enforcement of cases involving violations of trade regulations and penalties in the concessions, which were difficult to implement. After submitting a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry issued an approval yesterday, stating that it was aware of the report. It was found that if stores in various places use fraudulent methods to attract customers or use improper means to undercut each other, they should be strictly prohibited. The Ministry has already issued a notice to this effect for compliance. The trade regulations of the same industry should be submitted to the local competent authorities for verification and filing in accordance with the telegram from the Ministry in December of the nineteenth year, and they are not reported to the Ministry. Moreover, trade regulations are agreements jointly observed by the same industry, which are different from stamp duties, which are national tax revenues, and it is difficult to compare them. However, the execution of cases involving violations of trade regulations and penalties in the concessions, as stated by the Chamber, is indeed restricted due to international realities and is not easy to implement. The Ministry has informed the Shanghai Municipal Government and instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to convene the local chambers of commerce and industry associations to discuss effective measures for handling the matter and to consult with the concession authorities for assistance. This is hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Industry and Labor Union Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held its fifth executive committee meeting after re-election at its location on Shanxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Eleven committee members including Shen Huachen, Zhang Peishen, Zhang Yunsheng, Sun Rongchang, Xu Zuren, Chen Zezhong, Tang Shiqin, and Zhu Jingan were present. Chairman Shen Huachen reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has decided to conduct quality inspection starting July 1 to improve the export of Chinese silk. The meeting resolved to approve the principle and appointed five committee members including Shen Huachen, Chen Zezhong, Huang Jiwen, Tang Shiqin, and Zhu Jingan to study it. Regarding the registration of cocoon collection by member silk factories for the 25th year, although most have applied for registration since the beginning, some omissions are inevitable. The meeting resolved to urge member silk factories to register as soon as possible. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Goldsmith Workers to Hold General Assembly; Requesting Relief from the Ministry of Finance Authorities</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the goldsmith industry in this port has repeatedly submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance regarding the issue of silver purity and sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance, but without results. It is now learned that the industry's workers believe that this matter is closely related to their own interests. If the regulations of the Ministry of Finance are followed, not only will the business of goldsmiths not be able to be maintained, but there will inevitably be a danger of workers being laid off. The workers themselves also lack the equipment and skills to manufacture chemical silver. Therefore, a general assembly of goldsmith workers in Shanghai will be convened in the near future to discuss countermeasures and request relief from the Ministry of Finance authorities.</p>
<h3>Cotton Dealers Only Ask That; The Certificates of the Bureau of Inspection Have Effect</h3>
<p>The Cotton Trade Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: "Minister Wu Jun of the Nanjing Ministry of Industry and Commerce: I recently read in the newspaper that the regulations on cracking down on the addition of water and impurities in cotton have been amended and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan. At a time when cotton production is being improved and exports are being encouraged, strict crackdowns are necessary to promote product improvement. However, national legislation should be enforced from top to bottom, aiming at conforming to reality and not harming the law for private gain. Since the establishment of the Cotton Inspection Bureau by your ministry, general merchants have been cheered, and they are very fortunate to have legal and standard inspection certificates to protect their goods, so that they can avoid all disputes and losses. However, in the past year, the majority of cotton inspection certificates are not true to their name, and they cannot be trusted by domestic and foreign buyers, making the certificates ineffective. The reason for this cannot but be attributed to poor inspection policy. Now, I will report to your ministry in detail. I have found that the members of our association have always purchased cotton in the cotton-producing provinces and cities and sell it in Shanghai. According to the inspection regulations, goods that have not been inspected shall not be bought or sold. After the provincial governments established cotton crackdown offices, all purchased goods must first be inspected by the provincial government, and then re-inspected by the Commodity Inspection Bureau to determine whether they meet the standards before certificates can be issued and reported for export. It cannot be said that the goods purchased by the merchants are illegal. When arriving in Shanghai for re-inspection, the certificates state that the moisture content is 10% or 12-13%, but the baking inspection results actually find that the moisture content is 14-15-16%. When such unfortunate events occur, they are either discounted or the purchase and sale is stopped, and the merchants often suffer losses and are extremely distressed. This amendment also reduces the highest moisture standard of 13% to 12%. If it is considered to be deliberately falsified, they will be sentenced to three years of imprisonment or detention and fined 1,000 yuan. If we only limit the regulations and do not actually reform the inspection, then the merchants will suffer huge losses in the future, and they will be subject to defamation and criminal punishment at any time. This matter is related to the rise and fall of the national cotton industry, and it is difficult to be silent. I hereby report to your ministry and request that you order all commodity inspection bureaus under your jurisdiction to ensure that the moisture inspection of cotton is consistent with reality and should be responsible for standard guarantees. For the sake of stabilizing the business of our association members, we only ask that the inspection certificates issued by the commodity inspection bureaus be effective in the market, and we will be infinitely grateful. Urgent words, I beg you to examine and approve them for implementation, and I am extremely anxious to await orders. Shanghai Cotton Trade Association."</p>
<h3>Sun Hongyi's Funeral Yesterday; Mayor Wu and Others Went to Pay Their Respects</h3>
<p>Sun Hongyi (Bolan) was an advanced revolutionary and made contributions to the party and the country. He successively held important positions such as the Minister of Internal Affairs during the Beiyang Government era. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the northern generals discussed national affairs, Mr. Sun also participated in it. He originally lived in Tianjin and moved to Shanghai a year ago. Because he had been running around for the country all his life and experienced many worries, he declined social activities and concentrated on writing books. He eventually became exhausted and his latent liver and stomach disease recurred from time to time. Therefore, he had been plagued by illness for two years with almost no peaceful days. This year, due to the abnormal weather, his condition worsened. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away peacefully at 10:00 PM on the 26th, at the age of sixty-five. The funeral was held at his residence on Masnan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 29th). Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Central Committee member Sun Jingya, and Zhu Qinglan, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Yiting, and others went to pay their respects. Mr. Sun had two sons, the eldest named Bao Cun, who works at Jin Cheng Bank, and the second named Yu Shu, who is studying at Zhengfeng Middle School, and two daughters, one named Yu Rui and the other named Yu Chun. His wife is about the same age and is still alive.</p>
<h3>Fuyang Fellow Association Expanding Recruitment</h3>
<p>Fuyang is located on the banks of the Fuchun River. The residents of Fuyang in Shanghai originally had a small Fuyang Fellow Association in Shanghai. Because the number of residents of Fuyang in Shanghai has gradually increased in recent years, the association felt that it was necessary to expand the solicitation and consolidate the foundation of the association. A few days ago, a group of dozens of people, including Yu Mantuo, Jin Qianfu, Zhao Boming, Yu Yipo, Wang Baorong, Wang Shaoshi, Hua Tingsheng, Hua Qichang, Xu Mengwei, Xu Huisheng, Xu Chuncheng, and Xu Zhenpei, had a dinner meeting at the Hangzhou Restaurant. Xu Mengwei was elected as the chairman, and after discussion, they felt that it was indeed necessary to expand the solicitation. The fellow villagers who attended the meeting and other prestigious fellow villagers in Shanghai were the initiators. After the preparations were successful, all fellow villagers from all walks of life will be invited to join the association and hold a general meeting to apply to the competent authorities for registration in accordance with the law. It was decided on the spot to appoint Xu Mengwei as the director of the preparation, and Hua Tingsheng and Xu Zhenpei were designated as drafters of the regulations. In addition to the fellow villagers who attended the meeting as natural initiators, Qian Luqing, Ding Mengxing, Xia Baiyan, Jin Kaifu, Lou Wangxiang, Xu Baikui, Yu Zhengchao, Shan Xuanzhen, Yu Zhiying, Hua Yiying, Wang Xikun, Chen Xijue, Lu Wen, Shi Yinbo, Hua Shuren, Wang Shaohua, Lu Yiting, and Xu Xu were appointed as initiators. The fellow villagers who attended the meeting will separately solicit consent, and it is said that the association plans to build a Fuyang clubhouse in this district to benefit the fellow villagers.</p>

<h3>Rubber Industry; Unemployed Workers Form Sales Team; Purchase Domestic Goods in Bulk; Sell to Maintain Livelihood</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that in recent years, due to the impact of social depression and overproduction, various rubber factories in the city have been shrinking and laying off employees to cope with the situation, resulting in more than 2,000 unemployed workers. Workers such as Xu Jian, Zhao Shan, Gao Xin, Zheng Shibao, Zhong Wenjie, and Zhu Jianliang have initiated the organization of a rubber industry unemployed worker sales team because they see that unemployed workers are wandering aimlessly and struggling to make a living. They purchase domestic goods in bulk from domestic goods factories and the team members sell them to maintain their livelihoods. They have already reported to the party and government authorities for record and have found a group address at Xinminfang, Elig Road, in the French Concession to start preparations. All unemployed rubber workers who are introduced by two or more colleagues or certified by the factory can apply for registration and join the team.</p>
<h3>Ban Garden Welcomes Gao Jianfu</h3>

<h3>Registration Methods for Enclaves of Shanghai and Nanhui</h3>
<p>In Shanghai and Nanhui counties, the land is adjacent. Due to the unclear boundaries of the fifth district, where the land is transferred, the people have nowhere to register their land. Previously, the land bureaus of Shanghai and Nanhui counties jointly surveyed and implemented supplementary measurements. It is now learned that before the county boundaries are demarcated, the bureaus have agreed on a entrusted registration method for the convenience of landowners in the two counties. Land in Shangyi County within the territory of Nanyi County should be applied for registration to Nanyi County, and land in Nanyi County within the territory of Shangyi County should be applied for registration to Shangyi County. A separate number will be assigned to this application for registration to show the difference. It will be reviewed after the county boundaries are demarcated. It is also heard that the Shanghai County Land Bureau is investigating and compiling a list of land that has not been registered and submitting it to the provincial bureau. Once approved, the county government will send personnel to seal it up in the township.</p>

<h3>Butcher Shop Closes and Owner Flees</h3>
<p>Chongming native Xiao Genglang opened a Senshun Fresh Meat Shop at No. 2188 Haige Road, Xujiahui last year. Due to sluggish business recently, he owed more than 1,000 yuan to the pig industry and could not make up for it. He had no choice but to sell the shop and its assets to Qian Xiaomao, a native of Qibao, the shop's partner, the night before. Qian Xiaomao took over the business with a change of the signboard. The creditors learned about it and brought Qian Xiaomao to the police station in charge, requesting the recovery of the arrears.</p>

<h3>Fire Brigade Members; Clash During Firefighting; Fire Association has dispatched personnel to investigate thoroughly</h3>
<p>The Sanyang Candle Company on Wuhua Road, Zhabei, caught fire due to carelessness in the watering department a few days ago. The fire brigades in sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Zhabei and the Hujiamuqiao Hongzhen rushed to the scene to put out the fire. The fire brigade members of Hujiamuqiao Hongzhen suddenly clashed due to misunderstanding. The members of both sides were injured. They have each reported to the superior authorities requesting a thorough investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Incident Details</p>
<p>The watering department of the Sanyang Fireworks Candle Company on Wuhua Road, Zhabei, suddenly reported a fire at 9:50 PM the other day. The two fire brigades of Hujiamuqiao Hongzhen rushed to the scene to put out the fire one after another. At about 10:15, the fire was extinguished. The members of the two brigades suddenly clashed due to misunderstanding. The disturbance lasted for a long time. The members of both sides were persuaded by the personnel of the Fifth Team of the Security Regiment and the police station, and the team leaders Nei Zhenxiang and Yuan Zuyou led them back to their vehicles. According to the Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigade after the incident, member Hou Gengsheng was hit by a dragon head by a member of the Hongzhen Fire Brigade and fell down from a height. Fortunately, he was caught and spared injury. Team member Zhang Guoheng was hit on the head, and team member Li Huatang was axed in the arm. The two team members Zhang and Li were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The Hongzhen Fire Brigade also stated that member Wang Guifang was robbed of the water nozzle by a member of the Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigade and hit on the cheek. Member Xu Qiaolin was hit in the leg. The two members Wang and Xu were also sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Detention of Team Leader</p>
<p>After the conflict, Shen Zhuliang, Zhu Jingan, and Dong Gengsan, representatives of the Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigade, and Yuan Zuyou and Xu Xibao, representatives of the Hongzhen Fire Brigade, went to the Linping Road Police Station at 10:45 to report the incident. Both sides requested investigation of the perpetrators because the members were injured. The director of the police station, Niu Jingjian, suddenly detained the representatives of Hongzhen, Yuan Zuyou and Xu Xibao, in the police station and only released them at 12:15 the next day after they were released by the association.</p>
<p>Report to Association</p>
<p>It is now learned that the two fire brigades of Hujiamuqiao Hongzhen have each reported the details of the conflict to the Zhabei Fire Brigade Association and forwarded it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for a thorough investigation of the perpetrators.

<h3>China Merchants Jianglun Stops at Jiangyin; Trial for Six Months First; Chang, Xi, and Yin Three Places Produce Extremely Abundant; Continue Depending on How Well Merchants Protect</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Jianglun sailing on the Shanghai-Hankou line only anchors for a moment when passing Jiangyin and does not stop at the pier. The state-run China Merchants Bureau, in response to the request of the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, will stop all Jianglun ships belonging to the bureau at the Kaijuan Wharf on the south bank when they pass Jiangyin from Shanghai to Hankou from the 25th of this month in order to load and unload goods, etc., slightly recorded on the newspaper, now exploring the details as the resolution.</p>
<p>Reasons for Stopping</p>
<p>Jiangyin is adjacent to Wuxi and Changzhou. The products of Xi and Chang are extremely abundant. Because Jianglun ships have always passed Jiangyin without stopping at the pier, freight has always been transported by land. At the same time, the Hankou Yingcheng Gypsum Company and Jiangyin Yongda Company have a contract, and a large amount of gypsum is transported from Han to Yin every year. Therefore, not only Jianglun ships sailing from Shanghai to Hankou need to stop at the pier, but also those sailing from Han to Shanghai should stop when passing Jiangyin to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Trial for Six Months</p>
<p>The Jiangyin County Government, in view of the above reasons, requested the state-run China Merchants Bureau to order its ships to stop when passing Jiangyin. Later, the bureau consulted the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance and sent personnel to survey the waterway, which was considered feasible. Therefore, Jiang Dashu, who opened from Shanghai to Hankou on the 25th of this month, has begun to stop at the Kaijuan Wharf on the south bank to load and unload goods and passengers. However, sustainability depends entirely on the flourishing freight transport of Chang, Xi, and Yin. The China Merchants Bureau stipulates that it will conduct a trial for six months first, and then decide on the continuation based on the level of protection of local merchants.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Agrees to Organize the Chinese Tour Guide Association</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society states that the Sino-American Trade Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Our country's international balance of payments has been in deficit for years. The whole country is striving to balance income and expenditure and expand foreign trade. However, we only focus on exporting goods while neglecting the import of tourism. Attracting foreigners to travel in our country can not only enable them to spend their daily expenses and purchase more of our national products, thereby increasing national income and contributing to our country's surplus, but also allow foreigners to gain a deeper understanding of our country's culture and customs, eliminating all misunderstandings and superficial views, which is of great benefit. Various countries have been making unremitting efforts to promote this tourism industry. Japan has established a tourism bureau, and the French Ministry of Commerce and Industry has even set up a long-term position to be in charge of this matter. Other countries are either managed by the state or by public groups, with different methods but the same purpose. This kind of intangible income that France obtains from American tourists has exceeded 100 million US dollars. Japan uses cherry blossoms and Nikko mountains and rivers as attractions. Due to thorough guidance and vigorous publicity, it earns more than 50 million yuan a year from tourists. Our country has scenic spots and beautiful landscapes everywhere, such as the palaces of Beijing, the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou, the W峡 of the Yangtze River, and the landscapes of Guilin, which are far better than Japan's Kyoto and Nikko. However, our country lacks tour guides and promotion efforts, which leads European and American tourists to regard Japan as their destination. Those who pass through Shanghai by boat only go ashore to take a look at the concessions. In view of this, our association intends to unite with your association to organize the China Tour Guide Association, invite major shops, hotels, shipping companies, and leaders from all walks of life to become members, and request the central and local governments to allocate funds to print scenic spots and beautiful landscapes in the country and spread them abroad, attracting overseas people to travel in China. We will also set up tour guide offices in Shanghai and other scenic spots, so that those who come to our country for the first time will not have the problem of not knowing where to start. In terms of national income, we can also reverse the deficit." It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has replied yesterday agreeing to the proposal.</p>
<h3>China Flying Club: Tenth Scenic Flight</h3>
<p>Since the China Flying Club started scenic flights, it has flown nine times. A total of 200 members have participated, and many female compatriots have also participated. The flight results have been excellent. Yesterday, the club held its tenth scenic flight as usual at Longhua Airport. The members who participated included Sun Hengge, Huang Shaozhou, Tang Youxin, Guo Shaobai, Zhu Jiping, Zheng Lire, Zai Le, Zhu Yulin, Lu Fengchun, Zhang Jianqing, Shen Yubing, Lu Renchang, Rong Jintang, Gong Guochun, Chen Bi, Huang Yexu, Chen Wenlong, Wang Xiangxiong, Wang Shoufa, Wang Mei, Wang Bomin, Wang Shuntao, Zhu Zhongqian, Zhu Xing, and Shi Menglan, a total of twenty-five people. The female members were Wang Tingqing, Yan Jianying, and Yan Juying, three people. In addition, there were sixty-seven old men, Zhang Qiuyuan, and a total of twenty-nine members. They also used the second latest type of trainer aircraft to fly at the same time. Although the spring breeze was very strong, the passengers still felt very excited. It is also reported that the club's second latest type of trainer aircraft has now arrived in Shanghai, and the flight training class is actively preparing and will start training in May. Those who aspire to learn flight technology can sign up immediately, because the number of places in the first class is limited, and they may regret it if they are late.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Road: Fierce Worker Brawl, Two Injured and Hospitalized</h3>
<p>At around 7:40 last night, in front of No. 604 at the intersection of Edward Road and Zhejiang Road, two groups of people who looked like workers were openly arguing. At that time, there were dozens of people crowded together. Neither side would give in, and they roared at each other like thunder. Then a conflict broke out, and they grabbed each other. Who knew that people in Group A all had sharp weapons hidden on their bodies. As soon as the fight started, they all used iron rods and sharp knives to attack Group B. Group B was no match and ran away. Among them, a man from Jiangbei named Chen Hougui, 28 years old, worked in the Zhengda Printing Factory on Fujian Road and lived on Wuzhou Road. Because he was so engrossed in the fight, he didn't notice that he was surrounded by three or four people and suffered the taste of iron rods. One stick to the head was even more severe, causing his scalp to break open and bleed, and his mind became dizzy. Chen Hougui knew things were not good and was trying to escape when he was suddenly stabbed in the left shoulder by a sharp knife. Blood flowed like a waterfall, soaking through his shirt. He was inevitably flustered, so he hurriedly covered his head and scurried away to the south. However, he was exhausted and collapsed at the intersection of Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession. A nearby Vietnamese policeman noticed him and went forward to question him. He stammered and only said that he had been attacked in Zhejiang Road. The policeman, considering the matter a blood case, first sent him to the hospital for treatment and notified the Laozha Police Station to send detectives to investigate. However, this person had lost too much blood and had fallen into a coma, so no clues were obtained. Therefore, the identity of the other party's murderer was difficult to ascertain for a while. While they were hesitating, a middle-aged man with a Suzhou accent suddenly came to the hospital, requesting treatment for his injuries. He claimed his name was Wang Renhai, 28 years old, and he was a tea waiter in the Xin Xin Rooftop Garden. He had been hit on the head with an iron rod. When asked about the cause of his injury, he said that he was injured on Zhejiang Road. After a detailed investigation by the detective, it was decided to question him carefully. Only then did it become clear that these two were both figures from Group B who were arguing, and they also confessed the instigators of Group A. The detective returned to the police station and went out to hunt down the criminals. However, Chen Hougui's injuries were not light, and his life was in danger. As for the cause of the conflict between the two sides, it is said that it was caused by a dispute over interests.</p>
<h3>Stealing a Xian Shi Gift Certificate: Intercepted While Shopping, Thieves Punished Separately</h3>
<p>Yuan Liangbing, a translator at the French Municipal Council, lived at No. 39, Yun Chunfang, Lane 93, Julai Road. On the evening of February 6th, four thieves came, each holding a pistol to intimidate. They were robbed of clothing and other items, as well as a Xian Shi Company gift certificate No. 1596 worth 50 yuan, and escaped with the stolen goods. Later, the victim reported to the French Police Station, which ordered detectives to wait at the business department of Xian Shi Company. Sure enough, a female bandit, Ding Jinxian, came with the gift certificate to buy items and was arrested on the spot. She was taken back to the French Police Station and confessed the whereabouts of the bandit gang. The inspectors Jiang Pintian, detective Wang Rusong, Bao Tan Liu Yurong, Shen Jinshu, Weng Huanzhang, etc., successively arrested the thieves Chen Haiqing, Liu Shaoshan, Yun Jinlin, Tang Xuetian, Ju Zhengqing, Yu Songnian, and the suspected woman Liu Chenshi, etc., a total of seven people. They confiscated three pistols and fifty-five bullets and took them to the police station. After being sent to the Second Special Court for repeated trials and investigations, the judgment was made the day before yesterday afternoon. Judge Zhang Chaozuo sentenced Chen Haiqing and Liu Sishan to seven years of imprisonment for robbery, deprived of civil rights for seven years. Ding Jinxian was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for five years. Yun Jinlin was sentenced to four years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for four years. Tang Xuetian was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for three years. Ju Zhengqing and Yu Songnian were sentenced to six months of imprisonment each for selling military supplies. After the sentencing, the Chinese and Western Bao Tan of the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession reported that the defendants had committed a robbery case in the Mahuo Road area and requested to be brought for questioning. Judge Zhang ordered that the defendants be handed over to the British Police Station to be taken away and returned to the case for questioning.</p>
<h3>Abduction Case of the Young Boss of the Pawnshop: Record of Interrogation of Two Accomplices, Victim Testifies in Court, Adjournment to Question Accomplices Together</h3>
<p>Ke Long, the 14-year-old son of Weng Jingqing, the owner of the Dehe Pawnshop on Qiwupu Road, a wealthy merchant from Chaozhou, was abducted at Donghai School on Liaoyang Road at around 7 am on December 12th of last year and escaped. The Chinese and Western detectives of the General Inspection Office arrested the criminals Dong Xuezeng, Zhang Sheng, Dong Da, etc., from Yancheng, and sent them to the First Special Court, which sentenced them to nine years and six months of imprisonment each. There are still accomplices Tang Yaodong, Zhao Junda, and Xue Jinzhai and Xue Chunrong, a father and son suspected of writing the ransom letters, each released on bail of 500 yuan. The two defendants Tang and Zhao were returned to custody, pending the victim's arrival to identify them. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Quanzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, said that Weng's child was now in court and requested to be questioned. He stated that he saw the defendant Tang Yaodong enter the room in the garden where I was imprisoned in Shanghai once and talked with Dong Xuezeng and Zhang Sheng, who were guarding me. Because my ears were stuffed with cotton, I couldn't hear what they were saying. As for Zhao Junda, it was at the end of the year when I was crying in the room. He came in and said that he would let you go home in the spring, etc. I have never seen Xue Jinqi and Xue Chunrong. When questioned about the two defendants Tang and Zhao, their confessions were evasive. The two Xues did not admit to writing the letters on behalf, and they were still defended by lawyer Fan Gang. Judge Jiang ordered that they be released on their original bail. Tang Yaodong and Zhao Junda were returned to custody, and the trial was adjourned to bring the three criminals Dong Xuezeng, etc., to the case for further verification.</p>

<h3>The International Telecommunications Administration, etc., Were Ordered to Formulate Methods for Reviewing Radio Programs, Strictly Prohibiting the Broadcasting of Lewd and Obscene Songs, and Printing Opinion Forms for Listeners to Fill Out</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is paying close attention to the radio programs of the national no-money radio stations. In addition to strictly stipulating regulations for suppression and establishing radio stations by the International Telecommunications Administration to listen at any time, it has recently ordered the Tianjin and Hangzhou Telegraph Bureaus to purchase radios to listen at any time.

<h3>Shareholder Meeting of China Merchants Electric Company: Wang Yiting Reports on Business Conditions, Pudong New Power Plant Underway</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency said that the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company convened its 19th shareholders' meeting at Huzhe on Guizhou Road at 3 pm yesterday. Dozens of shareholders, including Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaoliang, Zhu Yinjiang, and Feng Bingnan, attended the meeting, with a total of 300,435 shares.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Wang Yiting reported on the business conditions of the past year, saying that the decline of various industries in Shanghai, the economic depression, and the financial contraction are all well known and need not be repeated. In this unfavorable economic environment, the company has been working hard on construction projects, with a long-term vision to build a permanent foundation, such as the planning of the new plant construction. The required gas turbine generators and boilers have been ordered from abroad. The expansion of the business area has been carried out in accordance with legal procedures. The design of the Qianlu extension has reached Zhuanqiao and Beiqiao on the Humin Road line in Shanghai County, and electricity is being transmitted to Xinzhuang Town. Other things, such as investing in the Huxi Power Company to share its profits and selling electricity to colleagues in other ports to promote its business, are all to consolidate the company's foundation and achieve results in the future.</p>
<p>Election of Supervisors</p>
<p>Then, a detailed report was made on the electricity business, divided into six items: A. Progress of the new plant, B. Roads, C. Distribution, D. Generation, E. Purchase of electricity, and F. Business. The report was very detailed. Then, Supervisor Zhang Wenbin reported on the accounts of the past year. At the end, the supervisors were elected, and Zhang Wenbin and other five people were elected. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>New Power Plant</p>
<p>The progress of the new plant, which is part of the electricity business report, is particularly noteworthy and is excerpted below. The machines and boilers required for the new power plant were ordered from the German Xi Liuzi Factory in October of this year, with two 15,000-kilowatt gas turbine generators, and from the British Baibage Factory, with 5,000 boilers. One boiler was ordered from the Czech Skoda Factory. Each boiler has a steam capacity of 70 tons and a pressure of 40 atmospheres. Other distribution board switchgear, transformer water making equipment, boiler electrical management, coal loading equipment, etc., have also been signed one after another. The above total value is 163,777 pounds, which is approximately 2,710,000 legal currency at the current exchange rate. There are still machine parts to be purchased, such as cranes, cold water pumps, boiler feed water pumps, gas pipes, water pipes, electrical wires in the factory, steel bones of the factory building, etc., which require approximately 50,000 pounds, which is approximately 800,000 legal currency. In addition, the cost of pile driving, foundation factory buildings, etc., is not included. The new plant is located in Pudong, which is very convenient for coal transportation and water supply. The cooling water intake equipment is determined to build an open ditch at the bottom of the Huangpu River to take water. The design of the factory building has reserved a location for the future installation of the third gas turbine generator and the fourth boiler. Therefore, the generating capacity of the new plant in the future can be increased from 30,000 kilowatts to 45,000 kilowatts without the need to drive piles or build another factory building. The new plant base area can be used to expand the capacity to 130,000 kilowatts in the future. As for the high voltage, it is divided into two types: one is 5,500 volts, which is specially used for high-voltage power transmission in the existing Hunan area of Shanghai, and the other is 33,000 volts, which is reserved for long-distance rural power transmission. In the future, the new plant will be built and managed properly, and the coal consumption for each degree of power generation can be reduced by at least four-tenths compared to the current coal consumption for power generation. Therefore, the company is proceeding urgently with the new plant project and cannot delay it.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Meeting of Pudong Electric Company</h3>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company held its annual shareholders' meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road in Shanghai at 2 pm yesterday. A total of 332 shareholders and representatives attended the meeting, with 11,150 shares, which exceeded one-half of the total number of shares. Zhao Jinqing was elected as the chairman of the shareholders' meeting. Then, General Manager Tong Shiheng stood up and reported, saying that the industry and commerce of the past year were extremely depressed, and the economic panic in the society set an unprecedented record. The company not only survived the difficulties but also made significant progress, which is very gratifying. In summary, there are four points: First, the company acquired various small power plants in the inland and expanded them into the company's business area, such as Zhaolou, Duhang, Hesha, Luhui, and Zhuqiao in Nanhui County, and Qingcungang and Taiqiao in Fengxian County. Each town had a small electric light factory, but now they are all completely shut down and replaced by the company's power supply business. The area inside and outside the county town of Chuansha County was formerly the business area of the Dachuan Electric Company. The area around Gujialu, Caojialu, and Gujialu was supplied by the Chuanbei Electric Company. They were also shut down one after another and allowed the company to continue to operate. In view of the fact that Xidukou in Fengxian County is a vital transportation hub on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, facing Minhang Town across the water, with convenient transportation, and is a future industrial center, it has also been expanded into the company's business area. All of them have been submitted to the Construction Committee for approval and licensing. From then on, the area east of the Huangpu River, including the city and four counties of Shangnan, Chuanfeng, is all encompassed by the company's network, with a vast scope and rare match, also. Second, extend the Gao颷 transmission line so that all important towns in Pudong can enjoy cheap electricity. Therefore, starting from Yangsi Township in the west, passing through Zhoupu and Xinchang, and reaching the county town of Nanhui to sell electricity to the Nanhui Electric Company, and starting from Gaoxing Town in the east, passing through the county town of Chuansha, along Qin Gongtang, and reaching Zhuqiao in Nanhui to supply electricity to various townships, and extending from Jinjiaqiao to Zhangjiangzha to sell electricity to the Huibei Electric Company, and setting up lines to Zhaolou, Duhang, Tangkou, and Zhagang in Nanhui County, and reaching Qingcungang in Fengxian County, all were completed and energized within one year. The total length of overhead lines has increased from 246 kilometers to 350 kilometers, and the total number of electric poles has increased from more than 8,000 to more than 10,500. It is now progressing westward and should be able to通雷 to Xidukou within two months to supply the factories along the Huangpu River. The power grid plan is gradually being successful too. Third, determine the power generation policy and purchase more than ten acres of factory base along the Huangpu River to establish a long-term base. It is now estimated that the company's power supply load has exceeded 3,000 kilowatts, and it will not be difficult to increase it to 5,000 or 6,000 kilowatts in two or three years. It has been found that the major factories along the Huangpu River have about 10,000 kilowatts of self-provided power generation. If the company still purchases electricity and transfers it, it will not be enough to attract customers and expand. Therefore, for safety and economy, the power generation policy was determined in June of last year and submitted to the Construction Committee for approval and record, that is, the company purchased 52 acres of base along the Huangpu River in Wangjiadu, District 4, Shanghai County, to prepare for the construction of a new power plant. The specialist is now engaged in design, and once the foundation is laid, it will be easy to proceed too. Fourth, the company has been repeatedly commended by the Construction Committee for consecutive years, and was awarded a certificate of honor again last year. The number of awards is the highest among all electric companies in the country. It has also been trusted by shareholders to add 200,000 yuan of capital stock, which was fully paid up in less than two months. The enthusiastic situation is unprecedented. At the end of the year, the balance of income and expenditure shows a net profit of more than 179,500 yuan. The interest and dividends can be combined to get 14%, which shows that the more capital, the larger the business, and the thicker the shareholders' profits also. Then, Supervisor Wang Zhongxie explained the balance sheet, income statement, and surplus distribution plan. The chairman submitted it for a vote, and it was unanimously passed. The next discussion was on the purchase of machines, the construction of factories, and the expansion of capital stock. General Manager Zhang Shiheng explained the main points. After discussion, it was approved to build a new factory in Wangjiadu, and to bid for a 5,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator and two sets of boilers, and to start preparing for it on a certain date. The total amount of capital stock was expanded to 1.5 million yuan. The additional 500,000 yuan will be raised by the board of directors on a regular basis when needed. The results of the voting by the directors and supervisors were that the elected directors were Tong Jitong, Zhao Jinqing, Zhang Chanfen, Tong Shoumin, Wu Yunzhai, Qian Xinzhi, Lu Bohong, He Jingzhi, Huang Renzhi, Wang Zhongxie, Yang Dingchen, Zhu Hongqi, and Song Wenkui. The elected supervisors were Shan Yungong, Feng Bingnan, and Jia Jiying. When the meeting adjourned, the clock struck six.</p>

<h3>China Anti-Tuberculosis Association: Public Banquet for Lu, Li, and Ding, Each Delivering a Speech to Benefit the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>The supervisors, directors, and committee members of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association held a public banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA the other day, honoring Lu Bohong, the chairman of the association, Li Ting'an, the vice-chairman, and Ding Huikang, a tuberculosis expert. Attendees included Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Gongsu, Cai Jingjun, Li Xuanguo, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, Yang Guangxing, Lai Douyan, Weng Zhilong, Lu Lihua, Huang Jingwan, Diao Xinde, Ding Fubao, Weng Guoxun, Song Guobin, Liu Yide, Deng Qingshan, Wang Boyuan, Deng Xianxiang, Wang Zhenchang, Chen Tiesheng, Tong Xingmen, Liu Huilin, Li Zhaozhang, Fan Kan, and Sun Gan Cheng, among others. Li Dachao was elected as the chairman of the banquet, and Yan Fuqing delivered a welcome speech. Subsequently, Lu, Li, and Ding each delivered speeches in response. Details of each are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's Welcome Speech:</p>
<p>Tonight, we gather to celebrate Lu, Li, and Ding, which holds three meanings:</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Bohong was recently awarded the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy, and we share in this honor and extend our congratulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Ting'an traveled to Europe last autumn to study public health initiatives. We eagerly anticipate the innovations and advancements he will bring to the city's health sector. We wish the citizens improved health.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Huikang has devoted himself to the study of tuberculosis. After further research in Germany last year, he intends to advance the work of tuberculosis prevention. We sincerely welcome him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's Speech:</p>
<p>My involvement with charitable causes has been long-standing. Initially, doctors would invite me to visit hospital wards to encourage donations. Observing the suffering of patients, I resolved to dedicate my life to helping the poor and sick. I began by founding the Sacred Heart Hospital, taking over the Beiping Hospital, and establishing mental asylums and leprosariums within the Xin Pu Yu Tang. Last year, I was elected chairman of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association. I believe a tuberculosis sanatorium is urgently needed for those afflicted. We have already acquired 120 acres of land, and doctors and nurses have been recruited from abroad. When the sanatorium is established, it will accommodate approximately 800 patients, providing reduced or free care to the impoverished, thus providing a comprehensive solution to tuberculosis treatment. However, the construction cost is substantial, and I hope those present will assist with donations to make this a reality. Based on my past experience, any charitable endeavor requires not only human planning and management but also divine blessing to be successful. I share this aspiration with you all.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Speech:</p>
<p>I was commissioned to study public health in Europe for four months, during which I made many observations. Mr. Ding Huikang will provide a detailed report on tuberculosis prevention in various European countries, so I will refrain from further elaboration. Mayor Wu initiated this association, and I followed suit. Initially, Dr. Niu Huisheng served as chairman, but due to his health, I acted as chairman in my capacity as vice-chairman. After Dr. Niu resigned, the association carefully considered candidates and concluded that only someone with high moral character, prestige, and a passion for charity like Mr. Lu Bohong could assume the chairmanship. Therefore, I urged him to take on this difficult task, and Mr. Lu graciously accepted. This is not only Mr. Lu's commitment to righteousness but also a sign of God's blessing on our association. Since Mr. Lu assumed the chairmanship, the association's work has prospered, for which I am deeply grateful. Mr. Lu, recognizing the large number of tuberculosis patients in the city and the lack of sanatoriums, planned the construction of a large-scale tuberculosis sanatorium the previous year. The site has been selected, and medical staff is secured. It should be established soon. With my limited abilities, I will follow Mr. Lu's lead and work diligently on prevention efforts to live up to the expectations of my colleagues. I am deeply grateful for the sumptuous banquet provided by everyone tonight.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding's Speech:</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for the honor and lavish feast bestowed upon me by everyone tonight. I traveled to various European countries to study tuberculosis prevention efforts and found that people in each country are very thorough in their work. Countries like England, America, and Germany have achieved satisfactory results. This is due to the efforts of the people and the promotion and support of the respective governments. Tuberculosis prevention in our country is still in its infancy. Due to national weakness and poverty, active promotion is difficult. If "unemployment insurance" and "health insurance" can be implemented, tuberculosis prevention efforts can be expected to succeed. I hope leaders in the banking sector will vigorously promote this, so that the tuberculosis mortality rate can be reduced, and the work of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association can prosper.</p>

Her business is quite good, and her income is substantial. Unfortunately, this attracted the attention of bandits. At around 6 AM yesterday morning, while Tang Baobao was still in bed, five robbers broke into her house, heading straight for her bedroom.</p>
<p>The bandits pulled out a pistol, threatening Tang and forbidding her from moving. They demanded that she hand over the keys to her chest and searched everywhere, finally leaving with their loot about an hour later. Tang Baobao waited until the bandits were far away before daring to leave the house and shout for help. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the alarm, but it was too late. They accompanied her to report to the police station, where the head detective dispatched investigators to investigate the scene.

<h3>Woman Secretly Carrying a Gun Claims It Belongs to Informant, Wang Shoutang Also Arrested</h3>
<p>Pi Bingzhang, a Chinese detective at the Huishan Police Station, received a report on the 17th of this month at 7:20 PM from Wang Shoutang, a friend of a Chinese detective from Qingjiang, stating that a Zhenjiang woman, Zhang Chen, was carrying firearms for bandits and planning to rob someone. They would pass through Pingliang Road. Detective Pi, along with Chinese Detective Chief Zhou Guisen, rushed to Pingliang Road, Dalian Bay Road to wait. When Ms. Zhang arrived, they arrested her and found two pistols and twelve bullets. She was taken to the police station, claiming that Wang Shoutang had given her the guns and bullets, promising her five yuan. Detective Zhou, believing Wang was involved, sent a detective to No. 40 Wuzhou Road to arrest him. They were sent to the Special Court separately. The two defendants' statements differed. They were ordered to be detained, and Detective Pi was instructed to investigate and provide evidence. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi held a trial. Detective Pi stated that the Yanzhi Paper Shop at No. 147, Lane 1677, Yangshupu Road, had been robbed but the case had not been solved. Wang reported that Liu Jiazheng, Ms. Zhang Chen's husband, was responsible and was carrying firearms, intending to commit robbery elsewhere. Detective Zhou arrested her based on this information. Ms. Zhang Chen insisted that Wang Shoutang had given her the guns, denying any false accusation. Wang claimed that the guns and bullets belonged to her husband, Liu Jiazheng, who had asked her to carry them. She was Liu Chen. He was aware of this and secretly reported it to the police. Judge Jiang ruled that they should be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Appeal Hearing Concluded in Impersonating Military Officer Case, Original Ruling That Case Was Not Admissible</h3>
<p>The Hankou Military Camp uncovered several people impersonating officers of the 2nd General Guerrilla Army on the border of Xiang, E, and Chuan last month. They confessed that their accomplices were hiding in the Xiafei Apartment on Xiafei Road in the French Concession. The military camp sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, ordering Inspectors Yang Fengqi and Xu Pengfei to coordinate with the French police to arrest Brigade Commander Wang Dongyu, Quartermaster Yu Hou, Adjutant Zhang Xueli, and others at the address, seizing letters of appointment and badges. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court. The defendants hired Lawyer Xu Jie to defend them. The police filed charges of deception, obstructing order, and perjury. After the trial, the court ruled that the case was not admissible and ordered the defendants to be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial. The French Police Department disagreed with the ruling and filed an appeal with the High Third Branch Court. The High Third Branch Court Judge Zhu heard the appeal the other day. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the reasons for disagreement, arguing that the defendants committed the crime in the French Concession and should be punished by the court. Judge Zhu questioned each defendant and then adjourned the hearing to schedule a sentencing date.</p>

<h3>Report from the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Survey Group (8)</h3>
<p>— Sent from Guilin</p>
<p>Guangxi Province's Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>The commercial situation in Guangxi Province varies depending on the degree of development of each city. Wuzhou is located on the main route between Guangxi and Guangdong, with convenient transportation. Its commercial prosperity is the highest in the province. Nanning, the provincial capital, is the political center of the province, and its commerce has also developed accordingly. Its prosperity is no less than that of Wuzhou. However, the economic power of the entire province is largely in the hands of people from Guangdong. For example, out of the 1,393 stores in Wuzhou, only 268 are opened by people from this province, accounting for 19% of the total number of stores. Most of the others are operated by people from Guangdong, especially those selling Suzhou and Hangzhou silks and those in the money industry. Furthermore, out of Wuzhou's 24 silver firms, 23 are owned by people from Guangdong. The other one, Yu Gui, is a joint venture between Guangxi and Guangdong. Out of Nanning's 12 silver firms, those owned by people from Guangdong account for most of them. Lin Bogao, the chairman of the Nanning Chamber of Commerce, and most of the committee members are also from Guangdong. The reasons why Guangdong merchants occupy a superior position in Guangxi Province are that Guangdong people are good at business, have a sense of adventure, and have historical and geographical conditions in addition to the promotion of foreign goods. Guangdong is the birthplace of trade between China and foreign countries. Most of the trade between China and foreign countries is in the hands of Guangdong people. Due to geographical factors, Guangxi is naturally easily penetrated by the power of Guangdong merchants. It is said that Guangxi Province is a province with an import trade surplus, and its position is just like that of our country in the international market. Wuzhou is like Shanghai, that is, all cities in the inland of Guangxi have an import surplus to Wuzhou, and Wuzhou also has an import surplus to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Due to the import surplus, Guangxi's need for foreign currency is increasing day by day, and the power of foreign financial forces is naturally weakened. This is a major problem. On the way back, I spoke with Chen Xiong and Du Su, managers of the province's import and export trade office in Wuzhou. They said that Guangxi Province is currently striving to reduce the import surplus and hopes to become a province with an export surplus within one or two years.

<p>Hong Kong, 29th Telegram. In today's final of the Hong Kong International Cup Football Tournament, the Chinese team defeated Portugal by a score of 6 to 1, retaining the championship.</p>
<h3>Donghua Defeats Laks</h3>
<p>Result: Eight to Three, Forward Performance Splendid</p>
<p>Group B Lost to St. Francis by Seven to Zero</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Donghua Football Club had both Group A and Group B matches, held at Shen Garden. Group B first suffered a crushing defeat of zero to seven against St. Francis. Group A then achieved a great victory of eight to three over Laks. Hundreds of spectators were filled with mixed emotions. The lineups for the Group A match were as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Club</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Zhuang Youren, Gu Shangxiang, Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Guan Huidan, Feng Yunyou, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Shu Shigeng, Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Laks</p>
<p>Hai Qu Meng</p>
<p>Lao Gen, Nai Baolai, Ge Lifu, Bao Seli, Ke Kelan, Ke Kelan, Ma Xieer, Bei Ke, Lai En, Li Lun</p>
<p>Bo Luote</p>
<p>Two Goals in Five Minutes: Donghua's Chen Gong and Guan Xun'an were absent, with Lu Zhongen filling in as a defender. Guan Huidan, despite his theatrical performance in Group B, also took on the role of goalkeeper. Zhou Guangzhong also did not participate and was replaced by Shu Shigeng, leaving the defense weak. Fortunately, Li Yichen played as center forward despite his injury, strengthening the front line and keeping the opposing defense occupied. Huidan and Shigeng also put on a vigorous performance yesterday. After choosing the field, Donghua positioned themselves with the wind advantage. After a roundabout maneuver, Li Yichen received a pass from Zhang Jinhai and scored with a powerful shot, finding the back of the net. This was less than a minute after the start of the match. Soon, Yichen had another opportunity near the goal, but due to his unhealed head injury, he did not dare to head the ball, letting the chance slip away. Shortly after, Cao Qiuting made a solo run forward and was about to cross the ball when the opposing defender made a desperate save. Fearing another lost opportunity, Qiuting stumbled and fell, scoring another goal. Donghua scored two goals in five minutes, their rapid progress leaving the opponents stunned and bewildered.</p>
<p>Four to Zero at the End of the First Half: The opposing team made several fierce attacks, but ultimately their defensive concerns prevented their forwards from crossing the midfield line. Donghua also had several good opportunities that were squandered. The game remained in a dull stalemate for quite some time. Then, Donghua got a corner kick opportunity. Youliang took the kick, and Baolai failed to clear it far. Qiuting hooked the ball back from the baseline, Lao Gen regained possession but lost it again. Zhang Jinhai lightly nudged the ball, hitting the bullseye once more. In less than a minute, Donghua launched another major attack. Sun Jinshun emerged from the crowd, his iron leg sending the ball flying into the net. The Laks team suffered repeated setbacks and launched a fierce counterattack. Left winger Hai Qu Meng made a long-range shot, with incredible accuracy, but fortunately, Huidan showed his skills and turned the danger into safety. Soon, the lemon time arrived, with Donghua leading by four goals.</p>
<p>Yichen and Youliang Score Hat Tricks: The second half began, and the Laks team changed their positions, becoming slightly more active than before. For the first eight minutes, neither side scored. Donghua then got another corner kick opportunity. Various players opened the play. Li Yichen made a grounded sweeping shot, diagonally into the net, a clear and wonderful spectacle, worthy of an aria. Soon, Jinshun attacked the goal again. Lao Gen came out to meet him, and Youliang caught up to take another shot, the opposing force becoming even more fierce. The Laks team brought the ball to the goal, but it was blown far away by the wind. Soon, Youliang made a comeback, making a solo raid, incredibly fast, and raised his foot to score again, bringing the score to a massive seven to zero, further securing Donghua's position. During a fierce counterattack by the Laks team, the ball hovered at the midfield line. Suddenly, the referee, Nai Aituo, blew his silver whistle. Yichen, thinking a foul had been committed, sent the ball back. Huidan came out to receive it, but the ball was blown by the wind, drifting into the net. Shangxiang rushed to save it, but it was too late. At this time, the Laks team launched a major counterattack, and Bao Seli hastily stole a shot, scoring again. In less than a minute, the Laks team's central defender, Kokelan, also scored. After losing three goals in a row, the Donghua forwards fought bravely. Jia Youliang was as fast as a flying bird, sending the ball in with his foot. Yichen made a grounded shot, cutting across the goal and into the net again. After a little more maneuvering, the whistle blew loudly, and Donghua achieved a great victory of eight to three over Laks.</p>
<p>Donghua B Loses to St. Francis</p>
<p>Donghua Group B faced off against St. Francis at two o'clock. For the first ten minutes or so, neither side scored. After Endaya scored a goal, Donghua's center forward Wu Binghao injured his ankle and left the field. The first half ended with a score of one to zero. In the second half, Donghua continued to play with ten men, and Endaya scored five more goals, plus one penalty kick, for a final score of seven to zero. The lineups for the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>St. Francis</p>
<p>Sha Ruo, Xiao Qiete, Bao Luoding, Lai Sai, Boer Taisi, Fuen, F. Fuen, Endaya, Pan Tuosun, Su Ruo, Wei Lai</p>

<h3>Reunion with Lancashire: Youyou Suffers First Defeat</h3>
<p>Youyou was exhausted from days of intense matches, hence this defeat.</p>
<p>Overall Result: Two to One, This Defeat Greatly Affects Championship Hopes.</p>
<p>The Youyou B vs. Western Union B match in the Western Union Football League Group B was originally scheduled to take place yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. However, due to Western Union's incomplete team, they forfeited the match at the last minute, and Youyou B won without playing. Another Group A league match, Youyou vs. Lancashire, still took place as scheduled. This match was a reunion between the two teams. In the first round, the Youyou Club defeated Lancashire three to one, so the Lancashire team came well prepared with a very strong team, making the match a close and exciting contest. In the first half, the Youyou Club's defense was lax, and the Lancashire team took advantage of the opportunity to score a goal. In the second half, the Youyou Club tried hard to counterattack, but unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. The overall result was two to one. This defeat greatly impacts the championship prospects. The lineups for the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou Club</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Zhang Rong, Jiang Shanjing, Yun Feng, Chen Zhenxiang, Liang Shutang, Xu Jingcheng, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Wenkui, Xi Qiaosheng, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Lancashire: Bieliqi Mei, Tai Er, Balong, Fan Lilai, Huo Er, Bei Lai, Que Tewei Ke, Dun, Tai Weisi, Tou Na, Wei Erlisi</p>
<p>Dim Hopes: This defeat of the Youyou team, along with the scheduling arrangements of the Western Union, contributed to the outcome. The Youyou Club was exhausted from the match against Laks the day before and faced a strong Lancashire team that was well-rested, making victory unlikely. Yesterday, Yun Feng's performance was particularly poor, and his defense was inadequate. This was also a major cause of the defeat. The front line was scattered and undisciplined, and Jiang Shanjing was not as effective as usual. In contrast, the opposing team attacked with vigor, and their left inside forward ran all over the field, demonstrating unique skills. Their inner defense line was also quite solid. The Shanghai players for the upcoming World Games football selection have been confirmed and will depart for Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. Youyou Club's main players, Chen Zhenhe, Zhang Rongcai, and Liang Shutang, will all be attending, making the match next week against the French Business Club even more difficult. Therefore, the hopes for this year's championship are quite dim, and it is feared that our Chinese team will have no chance of winning.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Arrogance: The sound of the Hu Jia horn rose as the two teams lined up to face each other. Xu Wenkui led the charge, with Chen Zhenhe and Xi Qiaosheng following closely. They passed through various obstacles, their momentum strong. After maneuvering in a certain area, Chen Zhenhe unleashed a powerful shot, but it was inaccurate and unsuccessful. The enemy then seized the opportunity to attack. Fan Lilai commanded the troops on the border, sending a long pass to the center. Que Tewei Ke saw the opportunity and rushed forward, knocking on the door at the twelve-yard mark. Zhang Rongcai was unable to save it, and they immediately suffered a poisonous blow, losing the first point. This goal, scored only six minutes after the start of the match, boosted the enemy's morale, and their five forwards swirled menacingly in Youyou's territory. Fortunately, Zhang Rongcai made several high and low saves, preventing further devastation.</p>
<p>Failed Attacks: Xi Qiaosheng raised the flag and launched an offensive, encroaching across the border and attacking from the right sideline. Chen Zhenhe provided support from the rear. After three or five passes, they had penetrated deep into enemy territory. Xi Qiaosheng took a shot, but it went too high and became an outfield ball. Xu Jingcheng made a comeback, launching another offensive, but it was intercepted by Bieliqi Mei. The foreign general Fan Lilai suddenly rose to the front, shooting powerfully from the baseline, passing in front of Youyou's goal, but Tou Na was unable to catch up, and it was saved. Tou Na returned with renewed vigor, sending a long pass to the left. Fan Lilai headed the ball, but Xiao Zhang was quick and agile, lying down to catch and clear it. Xu Wenkui got the ball, ran swiftly, and passed it to Xiao Hei Tan, but Zhenhe's header was slightly off, missing a good opportunity. Shortly after, the first half ended, with Lancashire leading by one to zero. After the lemon break, they switched sides to determine the victor.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores One Goal</p>
<p>Youyou harbored ambitions of avenging their previous defeat and launched a fierce counterattack. But suddenly, the enemy general Que Tewei Ke emerged from the crowd, dribbling straight towards the goal. Zhang Rong was unable to stop him. Que Tewei Ke raised his furry leg and shot like an arrow, the ball going straight into the corner of the net on the right side. Youyou suffered another defeat, and the enemy cheered with excitement, their attacks becoming even stronger. However, they were all blocked by Zhang Rongcai. Xu Wenkui jumped up and passed the ball to Xiao Hei Tan. Chen Zhenhe made a grounded sweep from the fifteen-yard mark, the ball hitting the left corner of the net, pulling back a goal.</p>
<p>Youyou Loses: Encouraged by this, the Youyou team fought with renewed vigor. Zhong Yongsen led the attack, with Chen Zhenhe and Xu Wenkui following closely. Upon reaching a certain point, Xu Wenkui rushed forward and kicked the ball towards the net, but Chen Zhenhe touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty. The goal was disallowed. Zhong Yongsen continued the effort, launching a second attack. Xu Wenkui ambushed the enemy camp, using his head to meet the ball, but it went too high and did not go in. At this time, the enemy general Pei Lai suddenly cramped his leg and left the field, leaving them with ten men. Youyou should have been able to take advantage of this and attack, but unfortunately, they were unlucky and missed many good opportunities. When Pei Lai returned to the field, it became even more difficult for Youyou to attack. Not long after, the Hu Jia horn sounded, and the result was two to one. Youyou suffered a painful defeat by one goal.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders Improvements in Compulsory Education in Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Fujian Province: On the 28th, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the Education Department of Fujian Province, stating: According to the inspection report of Yang Zhensheng, a special inspector hired by the Ministry, the province has made great efforts in promoting compulsory education, but there are still some points that need to be improved, which are hereby instructed as follows: It is wrong for the province's compulsory education funds to be issued at 90% since October of last year. In the future, they must be issued in full and not discounted. The discounted funds from before should still be used for compulsory education. The province still needs to fully promote and strictly implement the filling of enrollment quotas at all levels of ordinary primary schools and the implementation of the two-part teaching system. If the implementation of the two-part system is difficult, schools can be designated for testing first. After success, it can be promoted to other regions. The work-study schools run by the province are in line with the needs of poor children. It should be promoted and popularized in various regions. The above points should be followed.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province: On the 28th, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the Education Department of Guangdong Province, stating: According to the inspection report of Yang Zhensheng, a special inspector hired by the Ministry, there are still some points that need to be improved in the implementation of compulsory education in the province, which are hereby instructed as follows: The compulsory education funds undertaken by each county must be supervised to ensure that they are allocated in full and on time, so as not to delay the establishment of schools. The short-term primary schools that should be established in each county must also be strictly supervised and established within a time limit to ensure that they reach the planned target within this year. The number of out-of-school children in the province is estimated to be more than 1.98 million. In the 24th year of the Republic, the total number of short-term primary schools planned by various counties was 1,130. With the addition of ordinary primary schools, filling enrollment quotas, implementing the two-part system, and schools established by local governments in various counties and cities, the total number of students enrolled only accounts for 7.5% of out-of-school children. According to the compulsory education plan, at least 80% of out-of-school children should receive one year of education within the first five years. The rate at which the province enrolls children is far from the plan. Starting from the next year, the original plan set by the department must be strictly implemented, adding 12,309 classes each year without further delay. The equipment of schools at all levels and types is not sufficient. There should be a pre-determined plan to supplement them on schedule. Equipment costs should be listed in the budget in detail according to the standards set by the Ministry and should not be handled on an ad hoc basis. The above points should be followed.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>Gleanings</p>
<p>— (Chen Tiewu)</p>
<p>"Spring flowers" and "autumn moon" are considered the most lovely things in the pens of poets, but in fact, the loveliness of the "autumn moon" is permanent, while the loveliness of the "spring flowers" is temporary. When flowers are in full bloom, they certainly give poets a pleasant feeling, but in the blink of an eye, spring fades, and fallen petals have no master. "The flowing water carries away the fallen flowers, and spring departs," and that is another kind of sour taste.</p>
<p>"Flowers bloom and fade every year, how can a person grow young again?" Understanding this, we should work harder in this "moment worth a thousand gold" spring, and please remember: "The plan for the year lies in spring."</p>
<p>The most beautiful is the poppy flower, but the fruit it bears is extremely poisonous; common wildflowers that do not attract attention, on the other hand, will have a popular harvest in autumn; "romantic men" and "beautiful women" are often harmful poisons, so "judging people by their appearance" is the most foolish thing. People who are indulging in "spring dreams" should be aware and wake up.</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>Spring</p>
<p>— Hufan</p>
<p>The spring light has quietly slipped into the world.</p>
<p>The spring in Jiangnan is graceful and charming. It is like a painting, it has a bewitching and charming allure, it gives people pleasure and comfort.</p>
<p>Those beautiful mountains, those tranquil waters, the blue sky, the green waves of grass... aren't all these the lines of a poet? In the beautiful foothills, people will forget their youth. On the gentle lake, rowing a small boat, watching the early glow, and admiring the afterglow of the setting sun, how can this be a dream scene that profit-seeking people can imagine? "Deng Wei's" "Fragrant Snow Sea" is already ten miles of plum fragrance at this time. In the pink, crimson, and pure white flowers, who can still think of this broken reality of society?</p>
<p>"If you go to Jiangnan to catch up with spring, be sure to live with spring." This has become a timeless famous line. In these two simple sentences, we can get such a deep meaning!</p>
<p>These days, the spring breeze is kissing the soft-waisted willows, and the flying birds are sending the message of spring. Everything in Jiangnan is embraced by the spring light. Millions of youthful hearts must be drunk in the embrace of spring, right?</p>
<h3>春柳</h3>
<p>Spring Willow</p>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>Willow is the most wonderful embellishment of spring days. In sunny days, it hangs its fragrant posture; in rainy days, it contains light smoke; facing the marsh and brushing the embankment, it naturally has a painting-like meaning. The Supplementary Compilation of Zhiyi says: "No tree is easier to grow than the willow. All trees can also be transplanted by inserting branches into the soil, but only the willow can be planted upright, upside down, or horizontally, and it will grow. It is said that there is willow among the twenty-eight constellations, and the willow star shines on it, so planting will always grow. The reason may be so." Therefore, take a branch about a foot long, bury it deep in the soil, expose a little on the ground, and water it from time to time, and then it will surely grow in clusters. Choose the strongest one and leave it, and after a year, it can grow to more than ten feet tall.</p>
<p>"Yuan Boyu inserted willows in front of his house. In early spring, they sprouted, saying: 'I will get the leaking spring monk to be safe and sound.'" See Qing Yi Lu. The name is particularly remote and cold.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Yishui was ill and found that West Lake had no willows, like a beauty without eyebrows or a peacock without a tail. He packed his bags and went north to replant them. Gu Yingtai commissioned Lan Tianshu to paint a picture of Zhang planting willows in West Lake to give to him. Also, after Zuo Wenxiang quelled Xinjiang, he planted willows along the Tongganxin Avenue, reaching a length of three thousand miles, which was not only a special achievement in the Qing Dynasty's border defense construction, but also a career that Wenxiang considered his greatest success. When Wenxiang was stationed in Xinjiang, a Hunanese guest wandered into the new province and was unable to return due to poverty. Hearing that Zuo was there, he wrote a poem to him, saying: "The general has been on the western expedition for a long time and has not returned, and the Hunanese disciples are all over the Tianshan Mountains. Three thousand miles of newly planted willows have attracted the spring breeze to cross the Yumen Pass." Zuo was pleased that he had scratched the itch, praised him repeatedly, and treated him with courtesy and sent him home. These are all good stories about planting willows.</p>
<p>Painting Miscellaneous Records has a passage about painting willows, saying: "Song people mostly write weeping willows, and there are also willow trees with dotted leaves. Willows are not difficult to paint, as long as the branches are divided properly. The beauty of dotting willows lies in the round spreading of the tree crown, only using green juice to slag out, and also having the thought of Xiao Sen welcoming the wind and swaying. The branches should be half bright and half dark. Also, in March of spring, the willows have not yet drooped, and in September of autumn, the willows have already withered, and they should not be confused. The method should also reflect this meaning." Recently, I saw my friend Xie Junxianou's small painting of "Willow Shade Waiting for a Ferry," with a boat girl charming and graceful, reflected by tender willows, and at a glance, I knew it was a scene in March of spring, truly the work of a master.</p>
<h3>春之情調</h3>
<p>Spring Mood</p>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>There were also many children scattered in the open space next to the house, giggling and laughing while flying various kites. Looking at their happy faces, they didn't feel the labor of running at all. Some fell, but immediately got up and laughed. What a lively, vigorous, and innocent group they were. Just like the spring sunshine and spring vegetation, they were bright and prosperous. I felt an implication: Humans should have been lively and happy, living without knowing any pain. Natural vitality must not be harmed or destroyed.</p>
<p>We should liberate ourselves from the abyss of decadence, sorrow, and negativity... That azure blue sky, that long asphalt road, that ever-flowing spring water, those bright flowers... Aren't all natural products created for us humans? In the realm of nature, there are no elements of decadence, depression, or negativity. All misfortunes, sorrows, and darkness... are produced by the driving force of human subjectivity and emotion. Don't you see that the vegetation has now renewed its vitality? What do temporary hardships count for?</p>
<h3>吾家的春色</h3>
<p>The Spring Colors of My Home</p>
<p>— Photographed by Shoujuan at the Violet Convent</p>
<p>—Budding Little Peach and Active Goldfish—</p>
<p>Facing the bright spring sunshine, facing the flourishing Pennisetum setaceum in front of the window, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart. Breathing in a mouthful of fresh air, "Ah, humanity is happy!" Those unhappy humans, at the bottom of coal mines, on battlefields, under iron wheels, by dirty ditches... are not blaming nature. Natural scenery always treats humans equally, a rich man and a beggar, both can bask in the spring sunshine. All the encounters of fortune and misfortune, good and bad, are all distinctions made by humans themselves!</p>
<h3>春霧之清晨</h3>
<p>Spring Fog in the Morning</p>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>The city is quietly immersed in the hazy fog, damp. Walking briskly to the street, it's like a white gauze curtain hanging in front of me, so hazy. The bicycle bell rang crisply, and people and cars disappeared into the mist at a glance. Only the rubber tire marks were clearly imprinted on the damp ground.</p>
<p>Ahead, something is flashing red and green in the shadows. Is it the sun? Is it the moon? Or is it the pearl jewelry on the ladies?</p>
<p>The cool and humid spring breeze blows on my body, which is quite comfortable. I walked slowly to the Bund, wanting to see the fog scene on the river.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River, shrouded in light smoke, is quiet. There is no ship coming and going, and there is no echo of the whistle. Looking out, in the white vastness, I can only see the vague outline of Pudong, and the strange shadows of warships and merchant ships, like an unfinished painting. The tide seemed unable to withstand this deathly silence, angrily hitting the shore, stirring up a loud echo. This echo, on the desolate riverbank, in the lonely spring fog, seemed very majestic, loud, and powerful!</p>
<p>Fog is great, it can temporarily stop the movement of water, land, and air transportation, and make omnipotent science bow to it! But we need the bright sun, because it has greater power and meaning!</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>Changing Nest Luanfeng</p>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near Double Ninth Festival, Finding Tranquil Small Gathering, Lianzhu Warming Old Dreams, Drinking Hate for Thousands of Autumns</p>
<p>As the saying goes, above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou. Suzhou and Hangzhou are blessed lands on earth, which has been recognized by society since ancient times. However, the situation of Hangzhou and Suzhou is somewhat different. Hangzhou has a West Lake. Travelers, when they arrive in Hangzhou, can confirm this when they see the Three Temples and Six Bridges. Suzhou is not like that. Its reason for being a paradise lies entirely in its internal qualities. This internal quality cannot be seen by travelers as soon as they arrive at the Suzhou Banmen. This requires living for two or three months, tasting another kind of taste in food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and then you will know why Suzhou is a paradise. This paradise flavor cannot be fully described in a few words. It is better to use two words to include it, which is leisure. The word "leisure" can also be obtained in other cities. What is difficult to obtain is the word "comfort". People living in Suzhou can spend a small amount of money to make their food, clothing, shelter, and transportation all comfortable. How can this be seen? Based on the life of my friend, the owner of the Orchid Factory, it can be known. The owner of the Orchid Factory is just a scholar who makes a living by selling articles. From the time he started selling articles in his teens until he was forty years old, he actually relied on a sum of money that he had saved up from his hard work to buy a desolate garden in Suzhou City as a residence. Although the garden had been deserted, after years of continuous sorting out, it felt very quiet and pleasant. Anyway, he took organizing the garden as a way to relax outside of work, and he didn't care about the effort, so the money spent was limited. Although there are various flowers and plants in this garden, the most luxuriant ones are two kinds, one is violet flowers, and the other is chrysanthemums. When I went to visit this garden, it was October in the Gregorian calendar, just when the chrysanthemums were in full bloom. At that time, I was a guest in Shanghai, and I heard that the situation in North China was deteriorating day by day. I wanted to return but couldn't, and I was very sad in my heart. The owner of the Orchid Factory heard this news, so he came to my residence to see me. In the small building where I lived, the scattered manuscript paper and books of various sizes on the desk occupied most of the space. My disheveled and dry hair hid the silver threads, and my haggard face showed paleness. The blue wool robe I was wearing, although the color was very deep, could still find the speckled ink marks on the sleeves and lapels. The owner of the Orchid Factory came into the room, and I rushed over to shake his hand first. When I held his hand, it was warm and soft, and I knew that my hand was cold. He took off his padded coat, revealing the blue silk robe and black wool jacket he was wearing, which had no wrinkles or marks. This, like his scholar's white face, did not show any signs of aging.

<h3>春之一隅</h3>
<p>A Corner of Spring</p>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>On Sunday, only the midday rooster crowed in the large courtyard, and there was no breeze at all. Spring in Jiangnan is really good, and the sun is so warm. I think in the urban gardens, many young people must be smiling and strolling around. Their clothes are fluttering, the fragrance of flowers blows under their temples, and their cheeks are dyed with a blush of slight intoxication. However, I was thrown into a corner of a small study, and even breathing was difficult. Occasionally looking at a corner of the blue sky, a light cloud, and a bright light outside the window, I began to regret not following my wife's group and going to Bansong Garden to stroll around.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a cup of clear tea like usual, light a cigarette, and sit on the rattan couch, meditating about the world, to dispel some of the novel loneliness I had been feeling lately. I immediately acted like I was in a play, doing this and that, and I stupidly watched the smoke, which flew into the fragrance of the tea and disappeared. However, my mood still couldn't settle down. I feel that the beautiful rainbow always exists in dreams, in the distant evening sky. If I flap my golden wings and fly towards the surrounding of the rainbow, this so-called "rainbow" is just water vapor that cannot be grasped. When things reach reality, they can prove the fallacy of previous fantasies. When fantasies are completely destroyed, the meaning of life becomes faint, and one tastes the deepest loneliness. "Loneliness" is not a literary expression, but the emotion of an instant when the heart cannot shed tears and dares not hate others, and secretly buries the suffering alone in a slight sweet smile.</p>
<p>So even though I wanted to forget everything and dress myself up as a cool poet, I couldn't. Instead, the maid stimulated my heart, and she said:</p>
<p>"Young master, what are you always doing at home?"</p>
<p>"What am I doing?" I also asked myself. But could I explain this subtle undertone to the maid? I just shook my head and reluctantly answered slowly:</p>
<p>"I like quietness. The city is full of dust!"</p>
<p>"Dust? Everyone runs to the city, and no one has suffocated." The maid smiled and left.</p>
<p>Indeed, staying stupidly at home still has more stifling air than dust, locking up one's own heart! Moreover, the sun burns on the flower tiles, and the whole body is covered with the comfortable breath of spring. My limbs are a little soft and itchy. Since there is no way, I have to find some friends to chat with, or maybe I can pick up some scenery of spring. If my friends are at home, it would be good to invite them to the park. If my friends and their wives are not free, it's also okay to just pull their girls along. It's always livelier than walking alone in the coolness. If they don't want to come out, then intrude into their warm family and just chat nonsense, let the hours pass by. Isn't that better than sitting at home bored?</p>
<p>So I walked to the bedroom and quietly inspected it once. First, I covered my wife's powder box, and then asked the maid to take the winter coat that she had taken off to the drying platform. Then I locked the door and slipped to the city wearing a cap. The sun, which had not been seen for many days after the continuous overcast and rainy days, was particularly bright and powerful, just like washing my pair of dry eyes.</p>
<p>Winding around many alleys, even though I passed through the crowds, my heart was always frozen. When I saw my friend's residence standing in front of me, I felt a little courage, reached out and pressed the doorbell, and stood on the steps waiting quietly for the sound of people inside the door. I waited for a long, long time, but there was no response. Looking at my own shadow, which was leaning obliquely on the steps, so thin and so quiet, I suddenly had some sad and lonely feelings.</p>
<p>The one who opened the door was the rickshaw driver, Ah Er. He told me that my friend's whole family had gone to Longhua to see the peach blossoms in the morning. This shot another arrow into my wounded nerves. Did I have any more energy to linger on the street and be laughed at by groups of spring tourists? I had to dejectedly retrace my original path and return home.</p>
<p>Still, the sound of roosters crowing in the large courtyard, and the sunlight flowed brightly into my study. My empty heart was just like the empty entire courtyard.</p>
<h3>春頌</h3>
<p>Ode to Spring</p>
<p>It is spring.</p>
<p>Quietly standing in front of the window, the bright sunshine shone on my face, as if telling me: "It is spring!"</p>
<p>Living in this hellish city, ten years have flown by, and I have also spent ten springs! However, in Shanghai, I don't seem to have spent spring. The four seasons seem to have no difference. If there is, then it is only to carefully appreciate it on the clothes of gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>Spring is indeed a beautiful girl. Her charming youth, like the flames of a burning spark, shines in the warm southern breeze.</p>
<p>Because the spring girl is too beautiful and too affectionate, the girl will sometimes fall; because the spring girl is too hot and too lively, she will sometimes be lovelorn!</p>
<p>Indeed, now it is spring.</p>
<p>Spring breeze, spring light, spring color, and spring fragrance have filled the entire universe. The human world, which has been withered all winter, is gradually recovering its harmonious vitality. I hope that happy people will always be intoxicated in the arms of the spring girl!</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Review of the International Capital Market</h3>
<p>— Liu Kongjun</p>
<p>The "International Capital Market" is closely related to the "International Money Market," and it is difficult to distinguish them in terms of their nature. Capital transactions, such as foreign loans or foreign direct investment, have the same impact on the lending country as the export of goods; the impact on the borrowing country is the same as the import of goods. After a long-term loan is established, short-term funds are placed at the disposal of the borrower, and the state that can be withdrawn is no different from other short-term funds. On the other hand, short-term transactions in the financial market are often a precursor to long-term loans; creditors often hope that debtors will establish long-term loans in the future, or sell securities in the capital market, in order to repay them. However, the functions of the two are different, and their institutions are also independent. The task of the Yu Rong market is to invest in short-term transactions and facilitate the movement of international short-term funds; the task of the capital market is to invest in long-term transactions and facilitate the movement of international long-term capital.</p>
<p>Transactions in the international capital market can be divided into two types: ① the issuance of new foreign bonds; ② the transfer or redistribution of old bonds in the hands of investors in various countries. On the surface, the funds of the international capital market often flow from rich countries to poor countries. Many commentators regard this as the biggest difference between the capital market and the financial market. This statement seems to be true, but it is not. When new foreign bonds are issued, funds do flow from rich countries to poor countries. However, the circulation and transfer of old bonds is always in the opposite direction. Residents of poor countries often purchase bonds issued by rich countries for the sake of security and profit. The reason for this is the fear of currency devaluation or the intention to avoid harsh taxes, which leads to capital flight, and there are many investors who flock to foreign bonds. The purchase of bonds issued by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands by the people of Greece and Uruguay is a prominent example.</p>
<p>The payment of principal and interest on debts by debtor countries is the second reason for the flow of capital from debtor countries to creditor countries. These funds are often used to purchase securities elsewhere and are retained in the capital market. In addition, international securities arbitrage transactions are also sufficient to promote the continued movement of securities. The issuance of new bonds represents a one-way flow of capital; while other transactions in the international capital market are often a two-way flow of capital.</p>
<p>The international financial market is important to the proper relationship of international economy and this is universally recognized. The international capital market is always subject to strict criticism from the world and close investigation by Congress. Therefore, in recent years, governments of various countries have formulated direct or indirect regulations on the capital market to restrict it. For example, the US government never interfered with short-term loans to Soviet Russia, but now the issuance of Soviet Russian securities in the United States is prohibited. However, short-term loans to Soviet Russia are mostly used to purchase capital goods. The distinction between long-term and short-term is only in name, and it is difficult to distinguish them economically.</p>
<p>The reason why the international capital market is subject to strict criticism from the world is not difficult to imagine. Most short-term foreign loans are operated by banks, and the losses are borne by the bank's shareholders or depositors indirectly. The failure of a bank does not change other positions, because the operation of international loans by banks is mostly a large-scale and solid organization, and its failure is very rare. Long-term loans, on the other hand, are funded by the issuance of bonds, and the majority of bondholders are actually in control. If losses are incurred due to debt default or a sharp drop in securities market prices, the burden is borne by the bondholders, not the issuing institution. In addition, political relations are also an important reason for governments to manage the issuance of foreign securities.</p>
<p>However, the relationship between the international capital market and the development of the world economy is no less important than the relationship between the international financial market and the movement of international goods and services. Without the help of international capital, economic progress would be slow, and some regions would not be as developed as they are today. In the past, almost every country needed foreign long-term capital, and the situation has not changed slightly today. The development of British industry and trade has benefited greatly from Dutch capital, and the United Kingdom has provided capital to develop the economies of European countries. The economic development of the United States in the nineteenth century relied on the inflow of capital from the United Kingdom and European countries. Recently, American capital has been used to develop the industries of South America, the Far East, and European countries.</p>
<p>History has shown us that the flow of long-term capital in various countries has produced many bad examples: such as mismanagement, excessive borrowing, misuse of funds, and bribery of officials. These events are no different internationally than they are domestically. Considering the pain experienced by Americans at that time from the failure of railway and real estate companies, it is more than foreign investment failure, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>The enlightenment of the economies of emerging countries and the industrialization of agricultural countries have two ways of investment: relying on domestic resources and using foreign capital. The former progresses very slowly, as in the case of Abyssinia. Even in the case of Abyssinia, its economic progress, such as the railway industry, has benefited greatly from foreign capital. Secondly, Soviet Russia, under the rule of the communist government, also uses its domestic resources to develop its industries. This policy is sufficient to promote the decline of domestic consumption power, because any goods that can find foreign sales are exported as much as possible in order to obtain capital goods. On the other hand, the industries of Canada and Germany have developed rapidly, and the living standards of their people have not felt embarrassed at all, because they have been able to reap the benefits of using foreign capital.</p>
<p>The impact of a country's development of natural resources and industries is not only on the country itself, but also on other countries. The use of large-scale foreign capital often makes imports exceed exports. In other words, the consumption of the borrowing country is bound to be above the production amount. This consumption is sufficient to promote the prosperity of the exporting country's industry. Moreover, after the development of natural resources, production increases, living standards improve, and exports will inevitably develop as a result. The surplus can be used to pay the principal and interest of foreign capital, and improve the living standards of other countries. On the other hand, when a country uses all or most of its own power to develop resources or industries, it is necessary to save capital, which often leads to a decline in domestic consumption power and forced exports, and the selling country will feel the adverse impact. The world knows that Soviet Russia exports wheat, milk, and other consumer goods needed by the country abroad in order to obtain foreign exchange for the purchase of capital goods. This forced export not only reduces the living standards of Russia, but also disrupts the commodity markets and world prices of other countries. Therefore, the international capital market transfers a country's capital to other countries, which can help the development of the world economy and prevent other countries from developing their resources with international dumping policies.</p>
<p>The consequences of the flow of international capital become more obvious when political and economic changes occur and the flow stops. At that time, countries that rely on the inflow of foreign capital and pay huge debts and interest every year have to find ways to reduce imports and increase exports. Since the autumn of 1930, after the inflow of international capital stopped, Germany had no choice but to use its domestic resources to pay off its foreign debts. As imports decreased, it adopted various methods to increase exports. This trend forced other countries to defend themselves and resist the import of German goods. Therefore, Germany had no choice but to default on its foreign debts.</p>
<p>A controlled flow of international capital is beneficial to both borrowing and lending countries, but if the flow is excessively radical, the result will be the opposite. Therefore, some countries restrict capital exports from exceeding the surplus of international balance of payments in order to avoid endangering their currency and banking system. If the surplus of the international balance of payments of the United States in a certain year is 500 million US dollars, the appropriate way is to safely invest the money abroad to meet economic needs; otherwise, foreign countries will be forced to take measures to resist American goods and services, or transport cash to the United States, or default on debts to the United States.</p>
<p>If a country exports capital exceeding the income it should receive from abroad, its currency and banking system will be in danger. The occurrence of this situation is due to the use of foreign short-term funds for foreign loans. Short-term funds can be withdrawn at any time, while long-term loans cannot be recovered. Large foreign securities are even more difficult to dispose of freely in foreign markets. Even if they can be disposed of reluctantly, it is unlikely that the market price will not plummet. The United Kingdom's abandonment of the gold standard in 1931 is a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>The adverse effects of excessive lending are like this. It must be known that excessive borrowing can also make debtor countries difficult to fulfill their debts. In theory, any country can absorb an unlimited amount of capital for various purposes, regardless of economic or non-economic purposes. However, in order to avoid default, the borrowing limit must be based on its ability to repay when unfavorable economic conditions occur. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Telephone Rate Increase and the Destruction of the Principles of Commodity Economy</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaoyu</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>We often hear about the fact that commodity production is restricted for profit, but we have never seen the trick of restricting the use of commodities for profit. Similarly, restricting the use of machinery and equipment is common when production is relatively excessive, but restricting the realization of the use value of commodities is very rare. However, this rare thing is now seen in China. The Shanghai Telephone Company's restriction on telephone users' use of telephones is a rare thing. The way to restrict the use of telephones is: residential users are only allowed to make 100 calls per month, and stores are only allowed to make 150 calls per month, with a fine of three cents for each call over the limit.</p>
<p>We know that telephone is a public utility commodity, and users install telephones and pay a certain amount of fees every month. Limiting calls is a disguised price increase, and it is also restricting the realization of the use value of commodities.</p>
<p>The economic aggression of the great powers in China often carries a posture of extra-economic seizure. This kind of extra-economic seizure is especially significant during economic panic. There are countless examples of this, and the current restriction on telephone use is a novel example. This event indicates a new offensive and oppression by the great powers' enterprises in China. From this, it can not only prove that the great powers support the feudal forces in China, hinder the development of China's economy, and make China's economy forever sink into a semi-colonial and even colonial situation; but also prove that the economic forces of the great powers in China are also intensifying the use of feudal extra-economic seizure methods.</p>
<p>We should not think that at this time when Shanghai's economy is extremely depressed, the increase in telephone rates will forget to increase Shanghai's depression. We must know that it is precisely because of the weakness of Shanghai's economy that the telephone company cannot obtain special huge profits, so it uses the method of extra charges to expand its extra income. We should not misjudge that the special reduction of telephone users in the Shanghai Special Zone in 1935 and the disguised increase in telephone rates did not take this fact into account; we must know that it is precisely because of the reduction of users and the inability of telephone companies to promote their business and expand their profits at this time of market depression that they adopted this new method to increase the burden on those who must install telephones, satisfy the telephone companies' desires, and transfer the disaster of depression. Although this new method will be a reason for further reduction of telephone users, it is also the result of the decline of users. In short, this is a special attempt and method of telephone companies to maintain and even increase profits in such a depressed situation in Shanghai. This is the general face of capital, but it is even more terrible in China.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's income has not decreased in recent years, but it has changed its tune and increased prices in disguise to increase its income. From the perspective of capital, it is not surprising that seeking to increase and even gain extra gains is the "heroic" nature of capital. It's just that from the perspective of the principles of commodity economy, this is a bit contrary to this principle. Let's try to dissect it roughly as follows.</p>
<p>We know that the so-called commodity "is first of all an external object, whose material makes it able to satisfy people's needs in some way" (Note 1). In other words, things that cannot satisfy people's needs cannot become commodities: and by analogy, things that cannot fully provide their effectiveness after purchase are not enough to be commodities. The value of a commodity is originally dual: use value and exchange value, and exchange value is the phenomenal form of value. Without exchange value, there is no value, but use value is an element that constitutes exchange value (Note 2), so exchange value depends on use value, and use value "can only be realized in use or consumption" (Note 3). Therefore, in the final analysis, the value of a commodity must ultimately rely on the use of the commodity to realize it. In other words, purchasing a commodity but not being able to freely enjoy its use value is a contradiction in commodity exchange and violates the basic laws of commodity economy.</p>
<p>The value of a telephone, from the perspective of the telephone company, exists in the fees paid by users every month, that is, in the exchange value. From the user's perspective, the value of the telephone exists in the free use of the telephone. Only in this way can the telephone company realize its exchange value, and the user can realize its use value. Only in this way can the telephone purchased by the telephone user realize its use value and achieve the original intention of installing the telephone. If users install telephones and have already paid a certain amount of money every month, but they are still restricted in the use of telephones, and they have to pay extra call fees if they exceed the limit, then from the perspective of common sense, this is an additional demand, and from the perspective of economic principles, this is even more contrary to the principles of commodity economy: after a commodity goes through the exchange process, the original commodity owner should let the buyer freely show its use value. That is to say, telephone users who have already paid the monthly fee have the right to freely enjoy the use of the telephone. The seller cannot restrict the buyer from realizing the use value of the goods, just as the buyer cannot interfere with how the seller disposes of the exchange value obtained from selling the goods. To be clear, the telephone company cannot restrict telephone users who have already paid the monthly fee from using the telephone, just as users cannot interfere with how the company uses the telephone fees collected.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, we can make an even more superficial analogy. Suppose we bought a pen or a pair of shoes. A certain price has already been paid or promised at the time of purchase. However, if the original commodity still restricts the use of the pen or shoes after the purchase: for the pen, it is limited to writing 1,000 words per day, and an extra fee will be charged for exceeding this limit; for the shoes, it is limited to walking one mile per day, and an extra fee will also be charged for exceeding this limit. Then, may I ask if this is a huge joke or a strange thing in the commodity economy? May I ask if this has destroyed the principles of commodity economy?</p>
<p>This analogy is no different in essence from charging extra for exceeding the limit of telephone calls.</p>
<p>To be honest, restricting the use of telephones is even more restricting the realization of the use value of this commodity. If the use value is not easy to realize, then its exchange value is not easy to realize, because few people will be willing to install this kind of telephone.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>In addition to the extra-economic seizure of users, the restriction on telephone use also makes the commodity itself unable to fully exert its effectiveness. A telephone is a machine, just like any other machine or tool, and it should exert its effectiveness as much as possible as needed. Only in this way can it provide its "economic" value as much as possible. If it is sealed off and not used, wouldn't it become a "painted cake", and how can it be a "utensil of daily life"? And wouldn't it artificially destroy the economic value of this "utensil"? Isn't this "a waste of natural resources" for human beings? Therefore, restricting the use of telephones, from this point of view, is also contrary to the economic principle that things must be used as much as possible to obtain their wonderful use.</p>
<p>And whether observed from the user's telephone or the company's equipment, the number of calls is more or less, apart from occupying the telephone line, there will be no profit or loss in other aspects. If we really want to talk about profit and loss, then the telephone machine and other related equipment will be damaged more if they are not used or used less (it is already common knowledge that machines are damaged when they are not used).</p>
<p>Now the telephone company restricts users' calls in an attempt to increase the company's profits. This is the same as Brazil's dumping of coffee into the sea and the United States' destruction of cotton and wheat (Note 4) for the purpose of maintaining and even increasing profits, but the nature and methods are very different. In the case of dumping coffee and destroying cotton and wheat, it is due to the relative oversupply of coffee and cotton and wheat, so reducing production and destroying them is still a characteristic of the capitalist economy, and it is precisely due to the lack of use or consumption. Now the Shanghai Telephone Company, for the sake of profit, does not destroy telephone machines (of course not, because there is no oversupply here), but restricts telephone users' calls. This is restricting the use or consumption of commodities. Isn't the intention and means more severe than the coffee merchants in Brazil and the cotton and wheat owners in the United States? Destroying coffee and destroying cotton and wheat is due to the relative oversupply of these products, but the Shanghai Telephone Company restricts the use of telephones not because users make too many calls, but because it wants to take a special means to increase profits. This is also a unique way of capital seizure.</p>
<p>The increase in commercial depression caused by the restriction on telephone use and the extra pain of ordinary telephone users are difficult to express in one word. The impact on the entire social and economic activities of Shanghai is certainly not superficial. Furthermore, the disputes caused by calculation errors and even fabricated and misplaced charges caused by telephone billing by the call will definitely be many. The telephone company can obtain an extra income from this, but on the user side, it is even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Moreover, this method of restricting the use of telephones will cause a sharp reduction in users, which will also be harmful to the telephone company's business.</p>
<p>In short, from the event of restricting telephone use, we can see even more how foreign businessmen regard China as something, and "take whatever they want" without regard for the pain of consumers.</p>
<p>The above is mainly based on a purely economic point of view. Of course, there are still many other aspects, but this article does not intend to describe them.</p>

<p>(Note 4) A National News Agency dispatch from Washington on July 17, 1933: "The Agricultural Adjustment Committee announced today that the movement to destroy cotton seedlings has been completely successful. It is estimated that cotton production this year can be reduced by 3.9 million bales. The government originally asked farmers to destroy 10 million acres. Now farmers have guaranteed to destroy more than this number." Also, on August 28 of the same year, Reuters Washington dispatch: "Agriculture Minister Wallace officially announced today that the number of acres of wheat sown in the United States will be reduced by 15 percent... Agriculture Minister Wallace estimates that wheat fields will be reduced by 9.6 million acres, and wheat production will be reduced by 12.4 million bushels."</p>
<h3>On Reducing Interest Rates from the Perspective of Factories</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The financial community unanimously believes that the issue of reducing interest rates on loans to industry and commerce is difficult to implement. The only reasons can be divided into:</p>
<p>(A) The interest rate on public bonds is still around 1%.</p>
<p>(B) The central national bank has no preparation for low-interest loans to the same industry.</p>
<p>(C) The escape of depositors' funds cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>(D) The level of interest rates depends on the market economy supply and demand situation and cannot be artificially suppressed.</p>
<p>Most economists also believe that the level of interest rates is not important. The most important thing is whether you can get financial accommodation with high interest rates. Such a judgment is certainly reasonable: the author stands on the position of the factory to discuss the relationship between the issue of reducing interest rates and the industrial sector, and clarify that the reduction of interest rates, birth, death, survival, and death are all interconnected factors and should be implemented sooner or later:</p>
<p>We know that China does not have national industrial capitalists. Even wealthy merchants and giants, who would be willing to gather together to make risky investments in factories, work hard, and be down-to-earth industrialists? They did not think of national light industry, such as textile factories. If I do not run it myself, the clothing needs of 450 million people will be supplied by foreign goods. There will always be a day when the funds run out and everything is eaten up! That is such a dangerous thing! Because of this, the few rare industrialists are externally influenced by the economic aggression and dumping policies of strong neighbors! Internally affected by the decline of the rural economy - and the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers must be maintained (the number of workers directly and indirectly may be more than hundreds of thousands). The funds obtained from the financial community by pledging goods are being exploited by high interest rates. In the past, the industrialists groaned in pain! Is there such a class? The financial community does not take a long-term view and makes low-interest loans with suspicion. Industrialists are too busy with interest for banks and money shops to maintain themselves. Once they fall into total collapse, I think banks, money shops, and depositors will definitely not be able to survive independently! Or someone said, you are just a one-sided argument. The financial industry also has environmental difficulties! I am a layman when it comes to whether the factory management is precise and economical, so I dare not reduce interest rates, let alone make large loans. However, it is a fact that the production cost of the industrial family is increased due to high interest rates and it is not easy to sell. It is necessary to sell at a loss, this is a fact. On the one hand, funds are idle in the bank vaults, or speculative businesses such as gold, goods, and public bonds are abused, but they are developing abnormally and lively! Inverting the cause and effect, the future is dangerous, and there are unimaginable things, which is also a fact and need not be concealed.</p>
<p>It takes millions of dollars for a textile factory, which is very common in European and Western countries. The extreme development of Japanese textile factories is also because there is no interest item in the cost of cotton yarn. In our country, there are very few yarn factories with more than 100,000 spindles. The interest burden on a bale of cotton yarn (20 standard) is more than ten yuan, and at least six or seven yuan. The distance between the market price and the cost often goes in the opposite direction! Selling at cost, how can it be allowed by the factual environment? This is why Chinese yarn cannot compete with Japanese yarn! If my Chinese yarn factory is calculated with 50,000 spindles, the lowest cost of borrowing land, houses, machines, and borrowing goods for operation is 2,500,000 yuan in national currency. The unified monthly interest rate is 0.95%, and the interest is rolled on interest, which requires an annual cost of more than 300,000 yuan. Even if the surplus can offset it, the industrialists are already working in vain! Where is there any room for developing the business? Those who lose money due to heavy interest burdens are everywhere. It is better to extinguish the fire before it starts! I hope that the government authorities will use the power of the national bank to lend suspicious funds to the financial industry to transfer to factories, or directly lend! At the same time, use administrative means and legal provisions to first stipulate a moderate interest rate, strictly prohibit high interest rates, and hope to achieve operating loans at a monthly interest rate of 7%, and other mortgage loans at a monthly interest rate of between 6%, so as to benefit industry and commerce and maintain each other!</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Shows Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>——Only Category D Bonds Experienced a Significant Drop——</p>
<p>Last week (March 23rd to 28th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange reached the settlement period for March futures, and May futures were also launched early. However, the market situation was not like the past, where there would be huge ups and downs due to short squeezes around the settlement period. Trading did not increase slightly because of this. The whole week was uneventful and passed peacefully. This kind of hovering and stagnant situation has been going on for nearly a month. Trading has decreased, and the prospects are very slim. The Exchange and brokers have all been greatly affected. With so many government bond chips, and such small fluctuations in the market, it must be because buyers are suspicious or sellers are scarce. It seems that one of the two must be true. In fact, most of the buyers who used to buy in large quantities, given the reforms, are hesitant and have gone elsewhere. Most of the sellers, who used to sell in smaller quantities, are wary due to the strict controls, and are mostly waiting for the right time to act. Therefore, the market is stable, trading is light, and on the surface, people's hearts are firm, but in reality, they are all wandering on divergent paths, each seeking their own way out. There was no significant trend to speak of last week. March trading only took place on Monday and Tuesday, and the market price did not shake slightly because of it, still fluctuating between one or two jiao. Only April trading took place on Wednesday, making the market even more stagnant and trading quiet. The addition of May futures on Thursday did not increase trading, and the market price still fluctuated between one or two jiao. March futures settlement was handled on Friday, and the market price fluctuated slightly more on Saturday, mostly falling by two or three jiao. As a result of the week's market prices, most were slightly lower by about two or three jiao. Only Category D bonds fell by five jiao, which was the most significant. The total turnover was 11,185,500 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>A report from the New Fung Foreign Firm states that yesterday (28th), the New York stock market showed mixed gains and losses. Steel stocks were initially sluggish, but later rebounded under the leadership of U.S. Steel. Utility stocks and railway stocks fluctuated differently. Auto stocks rose slightly, and transportation stocks fell slightly. Small exchange stocks varied. The bond market was quiet and somewhat weak. Half-day trading volume was 660,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Financial and Monetary Market Situation is Quiet</h3>
<p>Silver Dollar Off-Market Trading at Minus Five Hao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial situation was still peaceful. Due to the weekly holiday, the market was slightly quiet. Interest rates remained unchanged, both morning and afternoon at eight percent. Discounted bill transactions totaled over 2.6 million in the morning session, over 400,000 in new transactions, and over 400,000 in the afternoon session. Banks and foreign firms collected over 36 million yuan in receipts, and remittances from various sources totaled over 500,000 yuan. The market for subsidiary currency was very weak. The morning session saw 25,000 jiao of Guangdong small silver dollars traded, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. The off-market exchange rate was minus five hao compared to the previous day, at twelve jiao, five li, and five hao. Copper coins were still at 306,000 wen, with 8,568 strings traded, and legal tender was 1,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Merchants Absorb Substantially, Closing Market is Very Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with each month rising five pound-tones. Because the spot market was strong, the same industry actively bought May and July futures, so the profit-taking and short-selling amounts by the bulls were absorbed by spot merchants and large players. The new cotton monthly futures were relatively weak because the cotton field and farmland cases had not been finalized, but they were overturned by the continued dry weather in the west. At the close, short covering occurred, and the market was very firm. The spot market rose six pound-tones, and the futures market rose nine to nine pound-tones. English cotton spot rose three points, and futures fell one or two points. Indian cotton near-term contracts fell to far-term contracts. The amounts of exports that were expensed and long positions that were closed out were offset by short covering. The following was recorded for Pingguoer: a rise of one rupee; for Aomula: a rise of one to 1.25 rupees; for Bai Luoxi: a rise of 0.75 to one rupee (28th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bai Luoxi cotton on the 30th is 198.5 rupees, up one rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain: Bo Dao Supply Exceeds Demand, Northern Market Sales Turn Stagnant</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various sources were close to 40 (goods totaling over 8,000 shi). Among them, Bo Dao still accounted for the majority, and the willingness to purchase also suddenly weakened. The Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and Dalian gangs handled 1,480 bundles of original-packaged Bo Dao, 1,450 bundles of He Xia goods, and 450 bundles of Mo Geng. Therefore, the market for Bo rice was said to have supply exceeding demand. The prices of high-quality rice fell. Medium and low-quality Xin rice was able to remain steady because of its scarcity. The arrivals and sales of Hou Geng were similar, resulting in a stable situation. The ups and downs of Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan rice all depended on their quality.</p>
<p>Chang Gang Bai Geng 10.60 Jiao Li 9.82 Song Ting Late Package 9.83 Chang Gang Bai Yuan 10.00 Jiao Li Package 10.08 Songjiang Separate Sale 9.70 Chang Gang Yin Yuan 90.00 Xin Zhen Special Package 10.24 Songjiang Yin Yuan 9.23 Su Tong Gang Price Fixed Heavy Gu Special Package 10.15 Shipping Late Rice 9.90 Xie Lin Early Rice 9.50 Jiashan Late Package 9.40 Feng Jing Late Package 9.30 Lang Xia Early Rice 9.85 Fang Zheng Jian 9.03 Fang Zheng Gang Jian 9.14 Qian Xu Early Rice 9.87 Lian Tang Late Package 9.30 Jin Li Cheng Jian 9.03 Chuan Lai Miao Rice 9.0 Wu Ku Late Package 9.53</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the arrivals from various river gangs were 31 or 32. Sales of all goods on the market were weak. The price of high-quality Bai Geng rice fell by a small amount of 0.4 or 0.5 fen. The price of medium and low-quality rice fell by a small amount of 0.1 jiao. The price of Bo Dao rice fell by a small number of fen. The price of Yang Du Xian rice fell by 0.5 or 0.6 fen. The price of Yin Bian Yuan rice fell by 0.7 or 0.8 fen. The price of Xian Fu Lu rice remained unchanged, with a flat and weak price trend. The prices of all other types of rice showed a softening trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slight Increase or Decrease in Foreign Sugar Inventory</h3>
<p>(As of March 28th)</p>
<h3>Hardware: Surge in Supply of Yan Pi Iron</h3>
<p>The supply of Yan Pi Iron has traditionally been dominated by England, the United States, Belgium, Germany, and other countries. Recently, however, shipments have also been arriving from Japan. With large quantities of goods accumulating from Japanese, HSBC, and Osaka merchants, the market has been affected and prices have been weakening. The price for patterned iron is 8.5 yuan per dan, and the price for thin iron is 9 yuan and 0.5 jiao, a slight decrease of 0.25 jiao compared to before. There is some movement in transactions on this street, but there is no activity from other sources.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants Vigorously Purchase Yuan Nails</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Sichuan merchants were very active in trading Yuan Bian nails, purchasing more than 120 boxes in total. Due to soft market sentiment, there was no significant change in prices. For example, 3-fen nails were priced at 24 yuan, 4-fen nails at 21 yuan, 5-fen nails at 20 yuan, and 6-fen nails at 19 yuan (prices for 300 bundles). As for the selling prices of 600 bundles, 3-fen nails were sold for 47.5 yuan, 4-fen nails for 42 yuan, 5-fen nails for 39 yuan, and 6-fen nails remained unchanged at a discount of 7 yuan. It is observed that transactions involving 200 bundles of goods are more active in the market.</p>

<h3>Maintaining a Healthy Stomach</h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>Irregular eating times, overeating, or indulging in raw and cold foods, or accidentally eating spoiled food, can all cause the stomach to lose its health, reduce appetite, and lead to malnutrition throughout the body, and even cause tuberculosis. For example, Mr. Xia Chongjing, aged 27, made a pointless eating bet with his friends, resulting in vomiting. Afterwards, he felt nauseous at the sight of food, and his stomach was distended and stuffy. Various symptoms of indigestion arose in abundance. The medicine was not effective, and after many years, it did not heal. His muscles wasted away and he became listless. Last autumn, I instructed him to purchase German "Strong Stomach Essence." Before he finished three bottles, his stomach symptoms disappeared completely, and his appetite was strong. After continuing to take it for three weeks, the root cause of the disease was removed, and his body recovered its health. His muscles became full and his complexion ruddy. Since then, every time he eats, he is like a dragon and a tiger, and his energy increases day by day! This medicine is not only a pure enzyme preparation that is good for treating stomach ailments, but also contains spleen essence (internal organ hormones), so it can nourish the blood and brain. It also contains Vitamin B, which is good for treating beriberi, and there are no adverse side effects from taking too much.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission and Testicular Atrophy Rescued</h3>
<p>— Submitted by Cheng Dachang</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. Li Zixu, developed quite early. At the age of fifteen, he committed masturbation, resulting in incomplete development of his sexual organs, and he suffered from nocturnal emission early on. By the time he married at the age of twenty, his erectile strength was very weak. He had a dull pain in his lower back, dizziness, blurred vision, and complete memory loss. His complexion was sallow and he was mentally exhausted. Six years passed without any improvement. He had been treated repeatedly, but with little effect. One day, I visited him on business, and he told me about his suffering. I introduced him to German Merrell's "Body Fortifier." After taking it for more than a month, it had a significant effect. The development of his reproductive organs became normal, his erectile strength recovered, and his nocturnal emission and lower back pain disappeared suddenly. His complexion became plump and ruddy, and his spirits were lifted. He was like a different person than before. Within a year, he had another son, and he was extremely happy. Therefore, he tells everyone he meets that "Body Fortifier" is a source of happiness for men and women.</p>
<h3>Clinical Trial Record of Pulmonary Disease by Dr. Deng Yuanhe</h3>
<p>Coughing from Tuberculosis Extremely Cured, Repeatedly Healthy and Beautiful</p>
<p>Patient: Ms. Yu Gui, age 24, academic community. Medical history: She was naturally weak, afraid of exertion and averse to movement, and often had a dry cough. Symptoms: Her breathing was rapid and labored, and she experienced shortness of breath and palpitations with slight movement. Severe symptoms included dizziness and blurred vision. She had thick phlegm in the morning and feverishness in the afternoon. For the past four years, she has been extremely tired! Her menstrual cycle was irregular, and she suffered from insomnia and soft limbs. Repeated medication was ineffective, and she thought there was no cure. Last winter, she was introduced to me by her classmate, Ms. Wang, to seek treatment. Prescription: Diagnosis revealed that both lung apices had tubercular lesions, which could not be effectively treated with ordinary preparations. I strictly instructed her to purchase and take German "Lung Strengthener" to eradicate the cough, clear phlegm, and strengthen the lungs. At the same time, I ordered her to take German "Lady Enhancer" to regulate her menstrual cycle and cure her insomnia. In less than three weeks, she obtained good results. She slept soundly at night, and her spirits were lifted. I urged her to continue taking it for two more weeks without interruption, hoping for a radical cure. A few days ago, I met her at Sincere Company and saw that she was healthier and more beautiful than before, almost like a different person. According to her, more than a year after recovery, she is strong and mentally alert, and her studies are progressing rapidly.</p>
<h3>Blood in Sputum and Nocturnal Emission Cured Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Patient: Mr. Lai Yumin, age 33, business community. Medical history: Deficiency of qi and blood; also injured by excessive sexual activity after marriage. Symptoms: Coughing up blood, spitting white and greasy phlegm, chest pain, loss of appetite, nocturnal emission, impotence, irritability, insomnia, and physical exhaustion. He procrastinated for seven years, took almost every medicine, but with no improvement. Last spring, he came to me for treatment. Prescription: Examination revealed that tuberculosis had reached the second stage, which could not be cured without taking special medicine. I ordered him to take "Lung Strengthener." After taking about two boxes, the blood in his sputum stopped immediately, his appetite increased, and his cough decreased. At the same time, he took German "Body Fortifier," and his insomnia was cured, as was his nocturnal emission. Within a month, his many years of tuberculosis was completely cured! Yesterday, I received a letter from him saying that after recovery, he gained 42 pounds, his kidneys were strong, and his waist and knees were strong. He went to the hospital for sputum tests repeatedly, and no tuberculosis bacteria were found. X-ray examination proved that the affected area had increased connective tissue, confirming a radical cure.</p>
<h3>The Latest Theory on Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Failure to follow this principle means no radical cure is possible.</p>
<p>The body's disease-prevention and immune function is Lipoid, which contains functional lipoid juice. This is actually the most important antitoxin. If it is infected with a disease, this liquid will decrease, causing the disease to spread. Because gonorrhea is caused by hardy bacteria and toxins, it cannot be cured with the old, simple "membrane-penetrating sterilization" method. This is evident from the fact that patients who have suffered for many years have taken various medicines and only achieve temporary effects! German medical experts, after repeated failures, have been researching intently based on the new theory, and have gained a real grasp of the treatment of gonorrhea. Dr. Biedel has summarized their achievements, and the invention of "Clinon," the holy medicine for gonorrhea, has been successfully announced! The ingredients of this medicine are composed of responsive proteins extracted from non-pathogenic bacteria under special operations, Lipoid in bile, and duplicating agents containing fatty body fluids from animals and plants. It is the most effective non-specific stimulating therapy [Ungpezi Fische Reizherapie], named [altered treatment Umstimmung Stherdopie]. From then on, a new realm has been opened in gonorrhea treatment. After taking it, it can revitalize cells, increase function, increase immune bodies in the blood, increase white blood cells, and produce a strong phagocytic effect. Therefore, the dosage is at most four or five bottles, which can eliminate turbidity from gonorrhea, provide lifelong immunity, and prevent recurrence! Since "Clinon" became popular, the number of men and women suffering from gonorrhea in Western countries has decreased by 87%!</p>
<h3>Sexual Nerves and Reproductive Power</h3>

<p>The strength or weakness of our reproductive power is always judged by the health or lack thereof of the sexual nerves, because only with healthy sexual nerves can we hope for strong reproductive power. However, both sexes often lack sexual knowledge during their developmental years, and are tempted by the outside world to fall into the evil path of masturbation, causing damage to their sexual performance and reducing their reproductive power. The obvious symptoms are incomplete development, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, weak erectile strength. For women, this leads to irregular menstruation, deformity of the reproductive organs, leucorrhea, etc., and thus causes prolonged infertility, headaches, insomnia, lower back pain, soft legs, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Dr. Merrell of Germany, in view of the suffering of young men and women all over the world, invented "Body Fortifier" made from male animal hormones, and "Lady Enhancer" made from female animal hormones. These animals are all raised using scientific methods. When they reach puberty, the hormones in their testicles and ovaries are extracted and made using scientific methods, so the efficacy is profound. Taking it can reorganize the various tissues of the reproductive system within a few weeks, and the sexual nerves will also become stronger as a result. All incomplete development and menstrual problems will be eliminated. Not only will reproductive power be strengthened, but early aging can also be reversed to regain the beauty of youth and health.</p>
<h3>German "Clinon" Overcoming Various Types of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>(1) Many Years of Arthritis Cured</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Mei Chunshu, 33 years old, has suffered from gonorrhea for ten years, and it has turned into arthritis for four years. His joints are usually inflexible and very painful. He has taken various medicines to dispel dampness, relieve pain, and treat gonorrhea without success. I treated him and saw that his joints were swollen, his urine was cloudy, and there was a slight temperature. It was necessary to eliminate his inflammation as soon as possible, so I immediately administered "Clinon" to kill bacteria, eliminate inflammation, and relieve pain. After Mr. Mei took it for four weeks, the swelling subsided, the inflammation disappeared, and he could flex and extend all his joints freely. His urine was clear. He took two more bottles of "Clinon," and before he finished them, he was completely cured. Later, his wife was also infected, suffering from leucorrhea, vaginal discharge, and vaginal pain. I also introduced her to take "Clinon" internally, and "Karsueti vaginal tablets" were inserted into her vagina. She was also cured in four weeks.</p>
<p>(2) Suppurating Discharge</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Qi Zhizhong, 23 years old, came to me for treatment one week after contracting gonorrhea. His glans was large, his foreskin was inverted, he had painful urination, and his urine contained pus and blood. Mr. Qi was in great pain. This was the most severe stage of gonorrhea. I washed his urethra and ordered him to take "Clinon" to eliminate the inflammation from within. After a week, the swelling subsided, the pain stopped, and urination became easier. His urine gradually became clear. Therefore, within two weeks, all the gonococci were eliminated. Blood tests showed no gonococcal reaction. This is because the efficacy of "Clinon" is accurate, so the effect is so fast. No wonder it is popular in Europe and the United States, and it is now also used in our country.</p>
<h3>Radical Cure for Phlegm</h3>
<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Inflammation of the bronchial tubes, commonly known as phlegm, is most common in elderly patients, and often results from colds and coughs. It is the main cause of pneumonia and tuberculosis. My clinical experience shows that only taking German "Lung Strengthener" for just four or five bottles can cure it radically. It is a rare lung medicine with effective results. This product is not only good for treating colds and whooping cough in children, but also contains hormones from the liver, lungs, and spleen of turtles, bears, and deer to nourish deficiencies, cultivate the source, and prevent and treat tuberculosis in stages one, two, and three with remarkable efficacy. It is also a lecithin duplicate, which is an excellent medicine for smokers who cough up phlegm and those who are quitting addiction. If used as a perennial supplement, it can prevent tuberculosis and disease, strengthen the stomach and body, and bring extra energy.</p>
<h3>Another Young Man Escapes the Turbid Sea</h3>
<p>— Submission from Mr. Zeng Kewen</p>
<p>Due to youth, I mistakenly made bad friends, resulting in contracting gonorrhea. I concealed and delayed, and the disease became more complicated! I took various medicines indiscriminately, but it was difficult to cure radically. Urination was difficult. Every morning, the urethra was sealed shut. After urination, sperm leaked out drop by drop. Last spring, my bones and joints suddenly ached all over my body. It was difficult to bend and stretch. My knees were swollen and red, and I could not move an inch. It was said that the gonococcal toxins had entered my bones, and I was destined to be disabled. I became weaker and weaker! Fortunately, a friend, Mr. Gao Wei, introduced me to Dr. Yao Juyan for diagnosis and treatment. After one week of X-ray treatment, the pain was greatly reduced, and there was a great improvement. Dr. Yao quickly changed to use the latest German-invented anti-gonococcal serum to treat me. In about three weeks, it was completely effective. My joints recovered, and I could move freely. Even climbing stairs and traveling far distances, I had no discomfort. I have been completely cured since then. I have been working hard for two years and have not relapsed. I am strong again. I would like to ask your publication to set aside a corner to publicize this on my behalf, so that others with the same disease can know where to seek help, and the merit of a good doctor can be immortalized.</p>
<h3>Women's Hidden Diseases</h3>
<p>— Jin Yueren</p>
<p>The so-called women's hidden diseases, leucorrhea can really be its representative. This disease is mostly caused by sexual activity and masturbation, as well as unclean sexual intercourse. Patients often feel depressed and have constant local white discharge, which causes rot, redness, and swelling, often leading to infertility and marital discord. However, many patients are ashamed to speak up and refuse to tell anyone, so they endure the pain for a long time. In my clinical practice, I often use German "Karsueti vaginal tablets," because this medicine can kill bacteria and clarify the function of the sebaceous glands, and can also quickly heal broken mucous membranes. Those who have leucorrhea caused by gonorrhea can take "Clinon" internally at the same time, both of which can be cured in a short period of time and become pregnant as usual. The usage is simple, and every woman with leucorrhea can treat herself without any disadvantages.</p>

<p>Weak Body and Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Xiao Zhongwen asks: I am 22 years old. I used to masturbate, causing nocturnal emission. After quitting, the disease also healed. However, I then visited brothels, contracted gonorrhea, and nocturnal emission relapsed, so my body is abnormally weak. My gonorrhea has not healed, my right testicle hurts, and my urine is cloudy. What medicine can make my body strong and cure my gonorrhea?</p>
<p>Answer: Your gonorrhea has become epididymitis. It is best to ask Dr. Yao Juyan to perform serum therapy, but before treatment, you can take "Clinon." For nocturnal emission and weakness, you can take German "Body Fortifier," which can quickly cure the root cause.</p>
<p>Amenorrhea and Infertility</p>
<p>Chen Dacun asks: My wife's menstruation has always been irregular. Recently, she has become weaker due to the loss of her child, resulting in amenorrhea. However, she has a lot of leucorrhea, and her vagina is itchy from time to time. What medicine can make menstruation return and stop leucorrhea?</p>
<p>Answer: Amenorrhea is obviously the result of decreased ovarian function. You can take "Lady Enhancer." For leucorrhea, you must use "Karsueti vaginal tablets." The two medicines can be taken at the same time to cure the root cause.</p>
<p>Stomach Ailment and Cough</p>
<p>Zhang Suxiong asks: I am 25 years old. I have had a stomach ailment for the past two years that has not healed. Then I caught a cold, my throat felt stuffy, I had difficulty breathing, I coughed frequently, and I produced a lot of phlegm. What is the treatment?</p>
<p>Answer: For stomach ailments, take "Strong Stomach Essence." A cold and cough can easily turn into tuberculosis, so take "Lung Strengthener" quickly to avoid dangerous transformations.</p>
<h3>Clinical Report on Gonorrhea by Dr. Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sishan Road and Ningbo Road Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Easily Recurring Prostatitis</p>
<p>The disease that is most likely to recur after gonorrhea is chronic prostatitis. Because the urine in this disease does not change much, it remains clear and transparent. The gonococci in it must be examined with a microscope, and cannot be recognized with the naked eye at all. Therefore, patients always think that the disease has been cured. Then, when they encounter opportunities such as drinking alcohol, sexual activity, or excessive exertion, it suddenly recurs, then calms down again. Repeating and recurring like this makes it difficult to cure.</p>
<p>What is even more dangerous is that this disease seems to have no symptoms on the surface, so it is often transmitted to the wife unintentionally. According to my daily investigation, almost 98% or 99% of cases result in this kind of bad outcome. If only the original patient is treated, even if it is eradicated, it will be re-infected through sexual activity. Therefore, in my radical treatment method, I always have the couple treated at the same time, and I often achieve permanent radical cure. For example, Mr. Wang Baiyi suffered from gonococcal prostatitis for six years. He had been radically cured three times, but then relapsed. Later, he begged me to examine and treat him carefully. I learned that his wife had a lot of leucorrhea and her vulva was red and ulcerated. Mr. Wang had hardly paid attention to this. So I used X-ray and electrical therapy, took "Clinon" internally, and ordered his wife to also take "Clinon" internally and use "Karsueti vaginal tablets" externally, and brought them home for treatment. After three weeks, Mr. Wang's disease was 70% or 80% gone, and his wife's leucorrhea was greatly reduced. The inflammation of her vulva was gone. After five weeks of treatment for the couple, the gonorrhea that had not been completely cured for six years was completely cured. It has been more than two years now, and it has never recurred. And Mr. Wang passed away last year and a new son has been born, it is said.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Rampant Wind of Rent Evasion in This City</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day: "Recently, due to the economic downturn, there are more unemployed people than before, and those who are in arrears with rent are everywhere. Some even have wishful thinking, saving up a little capital to rent a house as a sub-landlord. Except for living in a small room themselves, most of it is sublet to others, and the rental income goes entirely into their own pockets. They simply perfunctorily deal with the primary landlord, and after delaying for five or six months, they abandon their dilapidated belongings, abscond, and live elsewhere, using the same tricks again. Such people often repeat this over and over again, regarding it as a way to make money, resulting in a rather rampant wind of rent evasion in the market."</p>
<p>Is the "wind of rent evasion" rampant because these people use the same tricks over and over again? Obviously, it is not like that. Rather than saying that the wind of rent evasion is caused by the cunning tricks of these people, it is more accurate to say that the wind of rent evasion is fundamentally caused by the economic downturn.</p>
<p>People living in Shanghai all have this feeling, which is that they spend one-third or even one-half of their monthly income on the "housing problem," and the remainder has to be allocated to "food," "clothing," and, if they have a wife and children, some has to be allocated to their children's "education expenses." One only has to close one's eyes to imagine the miserable situation. A man who earns a salary of about twenty yuan is, in fact, a beast of burden!</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that there are "such people" who use the tricks of making money like beasts of burden in this so-called depressed society. However, this is ultimately a very small part, and the wind of rent evasion cannot be stirred up by such people. The fundamental cause of the wind of rent evasion is this depressed society. A sub-landlord wants to rent a house by paying a deposit (which is sometimes very large!) for the purpose of subletting that small house to others. They themselves can live in a small room without paying rent, or even make money by relying on the house. However, in recent years, the economic downturn in the market has caused the "good dream" of sub-landlords to be "no longer" and is on the verge of being shattered. We only need to look at the entrances of every lane on the streets of Shanghai plastered with red, square "for rent" signs to see the distress of the sub-landlords. According to the law of supply and demand, if there is a large supply, the price falls. With many empty houses, the "rent" naturally plummets in the opposite direction. Sub-landlords originally wanted to find a way to "sublet the remaining rooms" so that they could avoid paying money themselves, but now they have to pay out of their own pockets. However, the sub-landlords cannot compare to the primary landlords. If a sub-landlord's house is empty for a few months, they will be in arrears with the primary landlord for a few months of rent. If this happens again, the primary landlord's lawyer's letter will be right in front of you. Therefore, the sub-landlord would rather abandon their dilapidated furniture and quietly run away. The so-called "wind of rent evasion" arises from this!</p>
<h3>A Story Under Ma'an Mountain</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>A Xing slowly retreated, blocked by the wall. He wanted to slip away, but a long tobacco pipe was held against his neck. People gradually peered in from outside the door, holding hoes and iron plows. Their faces were as taut as Old Man Tang's. A Xing knew that something significant was about to happen. His legs weakened, and he knelt down, begging:</p>
<p>"Everyone, listen, this matter was not done by me, A Xing. Let me go, and I will beg Zhang the Rich, and Brother Tao San will surely be released..."</p>
<p>Old Man Tang put away his tobacco pipe. A Xing hugged his head and slipped out, but he was struck several times on the back. He ignored the pain and ran towards the ridge of the field.</p>
<p>The men laughed victoriously. A gust of wind blew under Ma'an Mountain. The cuckoo brought the cheerful sound of "cuckoo, cuckoo."</p>
<h3>Iron Wheels</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>On a bumpy cobblestone street in the city, the bright spring sun shone just as splendidly, but there were no fragrant flowers or fluttering shadows. People enjoying the spring would not come here. Only the shop assistants in the small shops idly leaned on the dusty counters, looking lazy and sleepy. The passersby were so few, and the bellows workshop in the west was not working, with no sound of hammering boards. It was such a lonely street.</p>
<p>In the loneliness of spring, however, there rushed in a sound of iron wheels rolling on the cobblestones. Was it the wailing of the cobblestones being crushed? Or the roaring of the hard iron wheels? Or the symphony of the stone and iron fighting each other? In short, the silent and brilliant sunshine seemed to tremble, the lazy shop assistants were startled from their daydreams, and even a grain of dust on the counter trembled and jumped restlessly.</p>
<p>What came was a heavy-laden flatbed cart, piled high with more than a dozen large baskets of coal. The coal was black, and the faces of the laborers pulling the cart were also black. Under their feet was indeed the bright and splendid sunshine, but in front of them and behind them followed a fate as black as coal. Thick hemp ropes were thrown over each of their shoulders, seeming to cut into their flesh. Heavy, heavy, panting, breathing, and groaning, they cranked the iron wheels, turning, turning, for the sake of living. Their lives were tied to the iron wheels, and their fates followed the iron wheels in rotation, never ceasing, day after day, year after year...</p>
<p>"Hey, put some strength into it! Look at the sun... there are still three carts to pull!" The laborer holding the cart's brake bar urged anxiously the four laborers in front, black sweat beading on his forehead, his legs swaying from side to side, following the movement of the cart. The laborers in front also had black sweat beading on their foreheads, their heads leaning forward, their waists bent, and their eight legs moving forward in a staggered fashion. "Who isn't putting in effort! Who is slacking off! Damn it!</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Blowing)</p>
<p>The other day, Japanese Ambassador Arida returned to Shanghai and, in a speech at his official residence, said, "To let everything go and let it develop is indeed a method, but we must not let it go and must work hard." Tan Lao San said, the terminology of politicians is really difficult to understand. What is meant by letting go? What is meant by not letting go? I think letting go is just like this, and not letting go is just like that. Rather than this and that, I would rather do this and this, as you please. This is my terminology.</p>
<p>Among the soldiers of the Japanese Konoe Division and the First Division who participated in the February 26th Incident, 1,360 were detained in their original units. After a strict investigation by the prosecutors of the Tokyo Military Court, 1,320 people were released on the 19th and could be declared innocent. Tan Lao San said, the tumultuous February 26th Incident in Japan has come to this, and regardless of two sevens being fourteen or two eights being sixteen, this bad debt of immeasurable cost is also carelessly written off. What a pity.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Damn it, are you trying to kill us!" The laborer with the large pockmarks on his face was the first to turn his head. "What are you yelling about? We're all eating this bitter fate's rice." Then came the second...</p>
<p>As soon as everyone started talking, their strength relaxed.</p>
<p>The iron wheels rolled slowly on the cobblestone street. Then, the laborer holding the brake bar behind cursed again: "Damn it, who has grown four arms to push? You're playing dead, but I can't afford to be tired. If everyone doesn't work, even the bitter rice won't reach our mouths. If the boss gets angry, you'll have nothing to say in response. You're fighting with me, damn it, aren't I just a miserable ghost like you?" Before he could finish speaking—finally—</p>
<p>The iron wheels were stuck in a hole in the cobblestone street.</p>
<p>"Pull hard!" The four laborers in front groaned, leaning forward and straining all their strength. The thick hemp ropes pressed on their shoulders, heavily, and black sweat beaded on their foreheads, pulling, pulling, but the cart didn't move at all. The iron wheels seemed to have taken root on the rugged cobblestone street. They turned their heads, making distressed faces, and everyone was silent, seemingly condemning their own pointless chatter. Finally, the laborer with the large pockmarks on his face threw down the rope, walked to the iron wheels, and stretched out his thick arms, cranking the iron wheels:</p>
<p>"Pull hard, push hard!"</p>
<p>The iron wheels finally started to turn amid shouts, making the sound of iron rubbing against stone, breaking through the loneliness of spring and startling the shop assistants from their daydreams. And the lives and fates of the laborers were tied to the iron wheels, never ceasing, day after day, year after year...</p>
<h3>The Fallen People</h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>— Chronicle of Hometown Events, Part Two —</p>
<p>"Second Young Mistress, going to buy vegetables? Good morning!"</p>
<p>Every morning, the Second Young Mistress, with her disheveled white hair, would lead her grandson, Da Bao, who was six years old, out of the door of that large house with its gold and red paint peeling off from the wind and rain. When the neighbors saw her, they would deliberately raise their voices to greet her. And the Second Young Mistress, wearing a pair of thin-rimmed glasses, would roll her dull and weak eyes behind the glass circles at the person, smile, and with that smile, the wrinkles on her face, which were piled up thickly, would fold up like strips of leather. Her left hand tightly held Da Bao's arm, and she walked slowly, her small and pitiful bound feet, barely able to support her body, stepping unsteadily on the rugged cobblestone road, seen from afar.</p>
<p>If one happened to look at that dilapidated but enormous house with a sense of nostalgia, and then look at the aged and decrepit appearance of the homeowner and Da Bao, who dragged his sallow face all year round, one would feel unrelatedly moved to sigh: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Nora (16)</h3>
<p>— Drawing by Wan Chao Chen, Explanation by Xin Xin Xin</p>
<p>Nora bolted the door to Helmer's study, then called Krogstad in.</p>
<p>Krogstad had come because he had received Helmer's letter of dismissal. He demanded reinstatement, or he would reveal the forged promissory note. He said, "I want to restore my position in society. I haven't done anything wrong in these past eighteen months. Although life has been very difficult, I have always endured and struggled step by step. Now I am being pushed down again."</p>
<p>Nora had no choice, although she was very afraid.</p>
<p>Then, Krogstad threw the letter to Helmer in the mailbox and left.</p>
<p>At this time, Mrs. Linde, who had repaired the fancy dress costume, came in and, seeing that Nora looked very upset, pressed her to ask what was wrong.</p>
<p>Nora told her. (Although Nora was very afraid of this matter being exposed, she also had a dream of a "miracle.") Mrs. Linde volunteered, saying, "I will speak to Krogstad face to face. There was a time when he would agree to anything I asked."</p>
<p>At this time, Helmer knocked on the door and asked through the door, "Nora, why have you bolted all the doors?"</p>

<p>The Standard Singing Troupe, after being cobbled together by "Escort Specialist" Mr. Chen Yaoting, first made a "deal." According to Mr. Chen's leadership, he thought of the results of Zha Zhang's broadcast date and finally did not fall behind.</p>
<p>It is predicted that tonight there may be a broadcast of "Shall I Take You Home?" and you can hear many duets sung by Mr. Chen and the ladies, such as "My Lover is You," "I Can't Forget You," etc.!</p>
<p>"Singing Troupes" seem very easy to start, but since it is named "Standard," we will see his standard tofu skills! (That's me)</p>
<p>Jin Lang said: It is said that Mr. Chen Yaoting, with the help of his camera, is quite familiar with the singers of various singing groups. He has a remarkable title called "Escort Specialist," which shows that Mr. Chen is also a popular figure in singing groups. The "Standard Singing Troupe" he organized is naturally "a very good look."</p>

<h3>Letter from Liang Ha</h3>
<p>One Guards Her Chastity Like Jade, Flawless</p>
<p>One Develops Her Career, Risking Her Life Beyond the Pass</p>
<p>The issue of whether Liang Saizhu and Hart "do not know each other" has come to an end. Because Miss Liang's letter did not provide counter-evidence of "do not know each other," Hart only denied being a "former lover." The letter from the other party is published below:</p>
<p>Reading the nameless counter-evidence in the 27th issue of this newspaper, I would like to clarify and ask for a deadline so that people can distinguish clearly. There is no need for much debate. After five years, Hurt is one of the leading roles in the Warrior film and has finally raised his head. He should concentrate on his work and not pursue vain fame. As for whether the performance is good or not, someone has commented. Why is it that Liang Saizhu is his former lover and is used to ruin people's reputations? How glorious Hurt was five years ago is conceivable. Moreover, Liang Saizhu has always guarded her chastity like jade and is still flawless, unlike unqualified people who are insulted at will. Hurt probably has a mental disorder. If not, he must be too vain. Therefore, he deliberately published the words "former lover" and the name of one of the leading roles in the Warrior film to flaunt himself. What is the reason? (Original letter) Saizhu's statement.</p>
<h3>Chaplin's "Modern Times"</h3>
<p>Nanjing and Shanghai Will Show It Simultaneously Next Time</p>
<p>(Above omitted) As a loyal young man, in addition to caring about developing my own career, I have always been distant from the matter of women. Moreover, Liang Saizhu is a modern red dancer, and I am a modern penniless man. How can I talk about love! Love is something occupied by the propertied class. Isn't that a toad wanting to eat swan meat? Although I knew Liang Saizhu a few years ago, this is only knowing her. If knowing means love, then I also know her parents and sisters. Isn't this a strange joke? I used to see similar things in the Xiaochen Daily, saying that I left my family and went to Guandong, traveling back and forth between Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Hangzhou, and Wuxi, and even committed suicide once because I was in love with Liang Saizhu. At that time, I wanted to write a letter to correct it, but then the Xiaochen Daily closed down. The reason why I left my family and went to Guandong, traveling back and forth, was actually for self-preservation. It was not for Liang Saizhu, and I have never committed suicide. Please, brother, and the movie correct it. (Below omitted) Hurt.</p>
