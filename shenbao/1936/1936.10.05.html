<h3>「三江好」訪問記</h3>
<p>— 屈原</p>
<p>『這就是「三江好」——羅先生，中國國民救國義　軍總司令。』友人指着一個中年男子向我介紹着。</p>
<p>『盼好久啦，當你不來了呢。』和藹安詳，看不出他就是威震東北的「三江好」。</p>
<p>一間南房，陰暗潮濕，陳設也很簡陋，這是他的家庭。有他的岳父母，（孟姓，原籍吉林，去年被迫入關），妻，侄等六口人。一聽東北口音，大家都很親熱。</p>
<p>「三江好」本姓羅名明星，自從九一八後，因為他和弟兄走遍了黑龍江，松花江和鴨綠江一帶。他們不怕死，不擾民；所以到處歡迎，便給他送個綽號呌「三江好」。</p>
<p>他是中等身材，光頭，白面皮，清瘦，三十九歲。音調低，說話慢，是個商人模樣。</p>
<p>『甚麼時候從東北來的？』</p>
<p>『是去年臘月十八，回來為的看看情形，咱同胞和政府若真有心幹的話，我們就再糾結幹下去。不然，我得另打算盤，不能不幹，也不能蠻幹哪！』</p>
<p>這時羅——「三江好」的岳母凑到我跟前，問長問短，嘮叨不休：『老沒見關外人了，你啥時入關的？』我說：『正是去年今日青紗帳起的時候，真快，轉眼一個整年了』</p>
<p>『你想家吧？』羅的太太也分外和氣。</p>
<p>『在外邊跑，那有工夫想家？不過今天到這兒，真像到了家鄉似的。每逢想起東北的朋友在那裏活活受罪，心就一陣陣地發焦。啊！一年來總沒得通訊了。』我說着不禁的慘然起來。</p>
<p>晚間，我們到街上吃飯，一半為的給他餞行。羅百般的怕舖張：</p>
<p>『隨便吃點好啦。餓肚的多着呢！朋友豈在乎這個？啥樣生活我都行，　東北，幾天不吃不睡，精神倒好，家居些日却煩悶起來了。』他不吸烟，不吃酒，只是慢吞吞地吃菜。</p>
<p>席間，談到九一八以來的情形：</p>
<p>『四五年來，經過的戰事，總不下五六百次。有時每天的小衝突就有一兩回。殺了昨多敵人，也喪了不少弟兄，你在關外也許都能聽到吧？』</p>
<p>『您的綽號我是早就知道的，還記得那次烟筒　的事件，真是兇得很，當時還流行一種民謠，現在可記不太清了』。</p>
<p>王放下酒杯想了想說：『我念給你一段聽吧，完全是東北老鄉的口吻。好，你聽着</p>
<p>「……</p>
<p>咱們都是窮光旦，</p>
<p>活着受罪死何難？</p>
<p>有權的可可以賣國土，</p>
<p>有綫的可以做漢奸，</p>
<p>咱沒有權來沒有綫，</p>
<p>走到那里是安全？</p>
<p>咱們只有打着幹，</p>
<p>奪回江山才有咱！</p>
<p>大家聽了淚滾滾，</p>
<p>個個低頭不　言。</p>
<p>齊隊就往山里走，</p>
<p>老大忽然變了臉，</p>
<p>大雪不住紛紛下，</p>
<p>一下下了好幾天。</p>
<p>好　個個走不動，</p>
<p>弟兄個個打戰戰。</p>
<p>都說出來救　好；</p>
<p>看來救國真可憐！</p>
<p>一時正在心發慘，</p>
<p>忽然大砲響連天，</p>
<p>抖抖精神往前闖，</p>
<p>咬着牙齒攻的歡！</p>
<p>……………………。」</p>
<p>「經過這些砲火，你負過傷麼？」</p>
<p>他笑着悄悄地捲起褲管給我們看。啊！一個個的疤痕，刻在膝上踝骨上脚背上和腿肚上。手上也有白色的紫色的圓洞，都是彈火燒成的。兩腕間爬着深重的癬疥，據說是在水里作戰三天的成績。這時我不禁興奮而慚愧起來，恭謹的敬獻一杯酒，他勉強着吃了下去。</p>
<p>夜間，大家不睡覺，儘管談：從羅（三江好）的個人到義勇軍，從活動的開始到現在。每件事都很複雜，可是他都能說得清　。同時他也曾流露出了這些話：</p>
<p>「義勇軍的袖標是「不怕死不擾民。」那管弟兄們怎樣粗野殘暴，只要他遵行這六個字，我們就能存在，勝利。</p>
<p>「我們總不相信，中國會給人家滅掉，我們總相信，就是剩下一個人，也要抵抗！</p>
<p>「自然，不能高看自己，可也不能小看自己，事情不是明明擺着嗎？中國因為不齊心才吃了虧，後來雙齊過心，也就露過臉。</p>
<p>「救國是自家事，怎能靠別人？亡中國，救中國，都是中國人來幹的。</p>
<p>「幹義勇軍是我的生活，工作，甚樣危險困難也困不倒我。我清楚的看到：危險苦難是我分所應受，我所幹的也正是危險苦難的勾當</p>
<p>「旣然幹了，就是幹個水落石出，成功失敗，現在還顧計不了。</p>
<p>「誰有本領誰能救國我便跟誰走；誰願救國，誰同情我，誰就跟我來。救國不是一個人的事。管你是文的武的，不是為的救國麼？來！大夥兒在一起來幹！」</p>
<p>又談了些「人民革命軍」的情形。最後問他甚麼時候回東北。</p>
<p>「先讓大哥（孟昭慶），羅之內兄，任　敵總指揮）下去，我聽個信息再走。為日也不久了。現在，我身在國內而心在東北，早走一天早安一天心。今後在工作報告方面，還想多用點力，已往咱只管埋頭　幹，什麼消息也透不進山海關來。這倒不是讓人家捧咱哄咱，只要他們　咱就够了。大家知道我們為了啥，幹些啥，那末死也甘心！」</p>
<p>第二天他請我寫字作紀念，我客觀的描寫了他的為人：</p>
<p>「偉大寓於平凡，鋒芒含於內在，不自　，不輕　，是英雄本色，鬥士胸襟。」</p>
<p>他高興的也拿起來給我寫了一幅。</p>
<p>「我和弟兄們的口號，就是不怕死不擾民，東北是咱的，咱不白送，他也不能白奪！」</p>

<h3>出超入超及我國出入超的檢討　（上）</h3>
<p>— 羅敦偉</p>
<p>在中央廣播電台講演</p>
<p>諸位聽衆！今日我來演講這個題目——出超入超及我國出入超的檢討。應該把牠分為兩部分來講：先把出超和入超有關係的理論，大略地說一說以後，再來討論我國出入超的情形。</p>
<p>現在先來講到出超和入超的意義。什麼呌做出超？一個國家在國際貿易上而輸出的商品的總值超過輸入，中間的差額，呌做出超。換句話，卽是輸出的商品總值大而輸入的商品總值小。　如輸出的商品總值十萬萬元，而輸入只有六萬萬元，其中所差的四萬萬元，卽是出超四萬萬元。因為輸出的商品多，可以多掙外國的錢，於自己國家是有好處的。因此出超又呌　　（Favorable　Balance）。入超恰恰和這個相反：卽是在國際貿易上面，輸入的商品總值多於輸出的商品總值。換句話，輸入的多而輸出的少。當然是外國方面多掙了本國的錢，於本國是有　的。因為年年入超，多景的金錢向外面流出，必至民窮財盡，所以一般人都呌入超的現象為逆差（Uufavorble　Balance）。</p>
<p>上面是簡單根據國際貿易方面來解釋出超和入超的。至於進一步研究出超和入超的實際狀况和他對於國計民生的影響，可並沒有這樣兒的簡單。因為國際間的經濟上的交易，情形複雜，種類也非常之多。商品交易不過是國際經濟交易的一班，祇能代表一部份的現象，並不能代表全體。英國學者格拉滋（G．Grunz）首先把國際間的商品交易，資本交易，和人民交易合併起來，總算為國際經濟平衡。從此以後，如果大家要研究國際間經濟平衡的人，不僅要注意商品交易，還要顧到人民交易，資本交易各方面；卽是不僅要看到有形的入超和出超，還要進一步留意無形的入超和出超。假定一個國家，他在商品交易方面，每年輸入是萬元，輸出是六萬萬元。可是他在另一方面，因為他的僑民在國外的事業非常發達，每年獲利很多，假定可以有七萬萬　欵回國，那末，他抵付商品交易的入超四萬萬元以外，還多了三萬萬元。事實上在國際經濟平衡上不僅不是入超，而且反是出超　萬萬元。由此類推，可以想像前面所備的出超和入超，只能就商品交易方面說。如果說到整個的國際經濟平衡，那末，情並形不如此簡單　所以一九二四年國際聯盟採用專家所提出來的國際經濟平衡計算法（為一九零五年國際統計學會中法國代表　M．de　Foville及奧國代表Sgruare　Gruber所提出），來清算國際經濟平衡。因為本題不能談得太詳，只好把出超和入超的理論方面，不再詳細的說。</p>
<p>現在要說到中國的國際經濟平衡方面，也就是中國的出超和入超的檢討。</p>
<p>我國對外貿易的趨勢，自一八六四年（前清同治　年）以來，除極少數的年份以外（如一八七二年至一八七六年），總是保持着長期的入超，而且一年年加多。民國二十一年多至八萬八千萬元以上，數目的巨大，更可驚人。最近一年來的　國對外貿易總值，現在做成了一個統計表。每年入超，除開民國十六年只有一萬四千多萬元以外，每年總是三萬萬元左右。民國二十年達八萬零四百萬元；二十一年八萬八千萬元；二十二年七萬三千三百萬元。自此以後，因為銀價高漲，國民的購買力薄弱，不能多量的購買外貨；因此出入口貨值同時减少，而每年的入超也還不少。二——三年為四萬九千四百四　五萬元。就是本年因為去年實行法幣政策以後，國際貿易情形比較好一點。可是　半年一月到六月的入超還是有一萬二千六百萬元，全年推算，也一定在二萬六千萬元左右，和民國十四年的入超數目不相上下。這樣長期而且巨大的入超，對於國民經濟的威脅，當然非常之大。這實在是一個民族的危機，現在把他分別檢討一下。</p>

<h3>非常時期之經濟條件</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>今年上海市塲。尙稱平穩。自金法郞貶値事件發生。標金外匯。一似風雨驟至。頓起波瀾。狂漲下跌。驚駭萬狀。際此各國競擴軍備之秋。歐陸擾攘不寧。東亞風雲變色。無怪投機主義者之活躍。惟是身處危局之中如吾人。者若徒自驚擾。寧復有益。卽如爭購黃金匯票。能供多少時間之享用。物價操縱。能有幾何盈利之可獲何况窺。伺有人。我棄人取。我取人與。大利究何所歸。實屬難言。</p>
<p>處今之世。無論應付何種事變。經濟條件為第一。以言經濟條件。吾人所有者如何。所準備者如何。各人所具犧牲之决心如何。「臨難無苟免。臨財無苟得」。大家能有此精神志趣吾乎。凡此皆深値吾人注意者。尤其在經濟組織。物資應求其充實完備。指揮應求其靈敏快捷。步驟應求其整齊劃一。而後可以應付非常之局面。設不此之圖。而自紊步驟。寗不可歎。</p>
<p>孔子有言。足食足兵。民信之矣。二十餘年來洋米進口。歲有所增。洋麥消費。數亦可觀。一旦海氛不靖。外糧斷絕。內憂可虞。差幸近一二年。以國內收成尙可。進口糧食。驟見稀少出口米糧忽焉大增。今年允號稱豐收。米穀雖未全登。而天氣順利。晚稻收成。不致過惡。然豐收則穀賤穀賤。則傷農。惟有趕緊作儲糧之準備。方可收兩重之利也。</p>
<p>抑為積儲之計者。競陳倉庫之說。誠然。無倉庫何能言積儲。但倉庫如何設備。為一大問題。蓋設備不善。建築不良。積儲之糧。易致紅朽。有事之秋。仍不能得其應用。舊時積儲之所以難得收效者。正為共不知選擇地點劃分區。域建築倉庫以容之。而乃利用就地寺宇公所。因陋就簡。故儲未半年。穀已蒸變。至今日而談積儲。豈可復蹈前轍。應就產米之區。擇集中之地。添凈糧乾糧之設備。造通風乾燥之棧房。我國果有為非常時期之民食計者。宜速起營謀。不可或緩矣。</p>

<h3>農村生活叢談　泰興農村的守望所（上）</h3>
<p>— 兪慶棠主編　啟鳳</p>
<p>我逃出我們這荒凉的偏在江北一隅的家鄉泰興，於今已經整三年了。父親來信中時常說：「家鄉如今更不像世道了，」我每决聽了父親這種頹喪的說話，心裏總不免要發生異感，而這麽想着：「這大槪是他年老衰敗時的神經作用罷？」但是，自我去年暑假期中在家鄕小住了一個月的經騐看來，覺得我父親所說的話是十二分眞實的。別的不談，就談談守望所罷。</p>
<p>這守望所是設在我鄕一個呌王家菴的農村上。宅的前身是公安分局，後來因為行政上的變更，公安分局就改為公安分駐所，公安分駐所成立沒有一年，不知怎樣又改為現在的守望所了。農民弄不懂這些名稱，守望所雖然改稱了將近二年，他們至今還是呌它做公安局。但事實上看來，它也和公安局差不了多少，它可以捉賭，可以拿辦烟客，更可以受理各種的訴訟，它的權限實在還要比公安局大哩。據說在從前公安分局時代，每月局裏有三千多塊錢的「外快」進益，公安分駐所時代也是一樣，到了守望所時代，大的因為鄉村農民身上實在沒有什麽可搜括了，進益有點兒不大「景氣」，然而幸賴守望所「局長」（一）的能幹和努力，每月中至少尙有五六百元的收入呢</p>
<p>這守望所「局長」的歷史談起來也很悠長。聽說他是一個裁縫出身，因為他的胆子很大，而且非常機警，在民國十七年我鄉土匪大亂的時節，他也在裏面着實幹了一番殺人放火的大事業。後來士匪的勢力稍殺，全鄕捉拿匪黨正鬧得緊張的時候，他又憑着他的一副機警本領吿訴着一個重要匪犯而自首了。因他這一點的功勞，他就被派當了現在的這「局長」職務。</p>
<p>在我到家的第四天，村上發生了一個刦案。被刦的是一個從外鄉移居到村上來尙不到二年的小商人。主人姓李，出外經商去了，妻子留在家里種種田度日，經濟方面在村中比較地是過得來的，但因為如此，所以他是不能安居在鄉村裏了。刦案的發生是在黃昏時節，進門的盜匪一共有五六個人，據說銀錢並沒有拿到，只取了三四十件男女新舊的衣服。後來其中有人嚷着「油水」太少了，所以結果又灌了幾斗的小麥袋在褲裙裏走了</p>
<p>事情發生後，村上的人起初大家心裏都非常驚擾，攘攘不可終日，後來不知怎樣，大家忽然又都噤着口不做聲了，並且對這事連談都不肯談起。為什麽呢？「這又是王家菴他們幹的！」及至家裏人輕輕的吿訴我這句話之後，我方才恍然而悟，原來這就是守望所要的人玩的把戲。我說：「李家為什麽不報縣呢？」「報縣？誰敢報？他們和上面人是連的，報了又有什麼用</p>
<p>但是，村上的空氣剛剛才澄淸了不到一個星期，忽然又有一件事扮演在大家的眼前了，那就是更夫劉老天被守望所指為李家刦案中嫌疑犯的事情。劉老天是我們村上一個已經過了五十歲的苦人兒，家裏只有他一個，因為年老無力再種入家的租田了，二年前就找着這種更夫的職務度度殘年。劉老天的忠誠盡職，是村上每個人都毫不猶豫地承認的，他的所以獲得這更夫的職務，也完全靠在這忠誠盡職四個字上。可是這一次他就被守望所硬指為强盜嫌疑犯了。劉老天是早一天吃夜飯時被守望所的人捉去的，從此不忍聽聞的消息，不住的從王家菴洩漏出來，說劉老天在「局」裏餓了兩天沒有飯吃了，或說劉老天的腿被「局」裏人打斷了，過了一些時又說劉老天已經承認拿出六塊錢放出來了。隔了兩天，果然發見劉老天睡在自己的床上。據他對人講的在守望所中的一切遭遇，和村上人所傳聞的差不多完全一樣。但是，劉老天的六塊錢從那裏拿出來呢？結果還不是我們村上的人倒霉嗎？</p>
<p>關於守望所敲詐民衆的事情，除掉上面所述的兩件外，還有一伴事値得叙述的，在我們村子的後首，原來私開了一家「烟燈」（二）。這「烟燈」自從開設以來，就成為守望所「外快」收入的經常門了。在政府禁烟條例未曾頒布以前，三天兩天有烟客被捉到守望所裏去罰欵的。烟老板那時還算自由，只要逢到「局」裏人每决經過時孝敬幾個烟泡就得了。可是從禁烟條例施行之日起，這烟老板也不大好做了。他也要和烟客一樣常到守望所受罰欵的處分了。烟老板領不起執照，只得投降守望所方面，每月拿出兩塊錢送去息事。在這樣的局面下差不多已維持了七八個月的光景。誰知事不湊巧，這私開烟燈的消息又被縣禁烟所曉得了。結果除烟具烟土充公不計外，還要處罰八十塊錢。烟老板回來把烟燈的大門一關，凖備另圖生活了。可是守望所不肯輕易干休，他們要找他來算賬。「局長」的意思過去幾個月每月所以只收兩元的「特許金」，原是凖備這「烟燈」長期開下去的而今一烟燈」旣中途關門，烟老板非要再拿出幾十塊錢出來貼補「局」裏過去幾個月的歉收不可。這個賬眞難算了，兩方竟相持不下，直到我離開家鄉的一天為止，聽說烟老板還被拘在守望所裏沒有放出來哩！</p>

<h3>國際幾件保僑名案（二）</h3>
<p>— 李聖五</p>
<p>三羅開斯普林暴動案　（Arracks　on　Chineseat　Rock　Springs）</p>
<p>羅開斯普林暴動案之受犧牲者為中國僑民，發生於一八八五年九月二日，此非留美中國華僑第一次受民衆暴動之侵害，不過最為嚴重之一次而已。中國人民僑居美國羅開斯普林地方者為數甚衆，多建屋自居，率從事於合法事業。突淤一八八五年九月二日被無法暴徒所攻擊，暴動份子的達一百五十餘人，持有槍械，在華僑方面並無引起暴徒攻擊之激動行為。暴動之初卽迫令華僑離開其房屋，於未及離開之前，便開槍射擊，因此被迫捨家離業，逃入山中，希圖苟全性命。其中許多人於未及逃離之、前，已遭殞命，卽在逃離中者亦被銳射。房屋財產，付諸火刦，全村淪為坵墟。結果華僑二十八人喪命，十五人受重傷，價値美金十四萬七千七百四十八元七角四分之財產悉遭焚燬，或被侵奪。事變發生之後美國政府派兵前往彈壓，未致繼續擴大，中國駐美公使當卽派遣駐舊金山及駐紐的之中國領事，往肇事地點調查。</p>
<p>一八八五年十一月三十日中國駐美公使鄭藻如氏備妥外交公文送致美國國務卿白納（MrBayaid）氏，叙明此項暴動之經過，先對美國政府派兵彈壓並與前往調查之中國領事以種種便利，表示謝意。繼則將調查所得之事實歸納為以下三項；</p>
<p>（一）中國僑民之被殺害，在中國僑民方面無引起此等暑動之行為</p>
<p>（二）暴動發生於白畫，當地官廳旣未制止，亦未鎭懾，僅於事發之後訊問一次，訊問之情節，勢同玩笑。</p>
<p>（三）據領事報吿，無一暴徒曾受地方當局之懲治。</p>
<p>因此鄭藻如公使卽代表中國政府向美國政府提出以下之要求：</p>
<p>（一）懲辦罪犯。</p>
<p>（二）賠償中國僑民所受之損害。</p>
<p>（三）美國政府探取有效手段，保護中國僑民，防止羅開斯普林及其他地方再發生回樣暴動事件。</p>
<p>在羅開斯普林事件發生之前，僑居加利佛尼亞洲（State6fCalifo　nia），阿拉斯加（Alaska），孟的納（Montana）及華盛頓等地之中國人民，均曾遭受羣衆暴動之侵害。當時中國代表向美國政府提出出交涉，則美國答覆之理由，每以美國之政治組織係聯邦制，聯邦政府不能干涉地方政府之行政行為為搪塞之口實。羅案發生之後，中國公使當卽駁覆上項口詞，謂暴動事件旣發生於美國國境之內，聯邦政府不得推諉責任。有時美國政府引據國際公法及國際禮節為辯詰之材料，此决中國公使拋開寬泛之國際公法，僅據國際禮節（InternationalComity）一點，作下述之答辯</p>
<p>根據一八五八年之中美條約，居住中國之美國僑民在當地所享受之法律保護，比較留美華僑所受美國之法律保護，幷無軒輕之別。同條約第十一條規定中國地方政府賦予美僑之法律保護，固非互惠條欵，然則貴國務卿因此卽謂美國地方政府不對華僑負此同等責任，鄙人「中國公使自稱」殊不瞭然。况一八六八年中美條約第六條及一八八零年中美條約第二條均規定僑美中國人民受最惠國人民之待遇乎？此則姑不深論，再就事實言之，在一八五八年以前，居住中國之美僑因搶刦暴動所受之損失，經美國代表提出交涉，由中國省政府或地方當局賠償損失之事例多矣。於一八五八年中。美兩國締結一項協定，由中國政府一次賠償美國七十三萬五千二百五十八元九角七分，淸結美國僑民一切賠償要求。此項賠欵超過美僑所要求之數目，嗣經美國政府將超過之數交還中國。自一八五八廿以來，美國駐華外交官以中國對外僑所負此等責任，幾已認為慣例，每逢美僑因暴動刦掠致遭生命財產。上之損害，卽銜美政府之訓令，向中國當局或地方政府提出交涉，非但要求損害賠償，而且要求懲辦罪犯。查閱此類案卷中，有由中國當局命令地方政府重建美僑之被毁房屋者，有令地方政府賠償美僑被盜之些微物件，而竊盜之人且無從捕獲者。（完未）</p>

<p>靜安寺路的汽車像長蛇陣似下午二句鍊了、這高絕遠東的四行二十二層大厦的左邊、正舉行着國貨展覽會的開幕儀式、門前的車馬、栽着了面帶笑容的實業家國貨事業家、一個一個的從車廂中走人會塲、</p>
<p>相當的引人注目是王曉箱氏的莊嚴、和許曉初氏的漂亮、還有祖任招待女賓的五位女訪問員、還有商塲前門的一只意見箱、後門也是一只意見箱、這都是我們或一般所引為具價値的舉動、</p>
<p>一點三刻、承許曉初先生的不棄、發表了一些簡短的談話、</p>
<p>「一般人以為國貨展覽會太生產化了、我卽以為還是値得舉行、昔人說士別三日、括目相看、我們國貨的製造家、都天天在精進着國貨進步的過程、允必須隨時供獻給一般看看、這就是非展覽會不可了、這一次的參加工廠、都是在各個行業中去挑選規模最大、出品最良的廠商、所以國貨展覽不僅是對外簡實還是對內、從生產者與生產者的相互間討論或硏求、再從消費者的瞭解到一般國貨出品的進步和比較、」</p>
<p>領略了許君的高見、便在會塲的週圍作一個巡禮、這裏有各廠形形色色的陳列、鈎角鬥心的裝潢、却逐一的分段寫在下而、</p>
<p>安樂毛織廠陳列着山也似的絨綫、還掛着一快英雄牌毛綫的年紅燈字牌、這英雄兩字、紅得　英雄的血、在風聲賀淚的今天、引得着靑年們的壯烈、</p>
<p>亞浦耳電器廠、把廠中的工作程序、設備程序的攝影、滿掛在商櫃的週圍、使參觀的人瞭解到中國電器事業的相當偉大、</p>
<p>美亞綢廠與中國化學工業社也相當的引人注意、大東南烟公司把一個紙製的香賓賽塲、放置商櫃的一角、騎師和馬、都可以轉動也是一套玩意見呢、</p>
<p>虎標永安堂這次殊很然烈、特地備了大批的廉價貨品、當塲發賣、我們知是永安堂的主人是愛虎嗜虎的、與張大千善孖昆仲有同好之雅、詎知走進永安堂的裏邊、赫然觸入眼簾者、有張氏昆仲手筆的虎畫四幅、該堂陳君語予、謂四幅虎畫、値價千金哩、</p>
<p>華生電器廠的陳設頗出色、把蘇東　夜遊赤壁的故事、製成了美術的畫圖、配色幽雅極了、引起了遊客們的美感、</p>
<p>益豐搪瓷廠的「金錢牌面盆」五字、也相當的引人注意、兪斌祺中文打字機廠、由一女職員在塲表演打字枝術、顯示着手腕的敏捷、</p>
<p>新亞藥廠的出品補使命、是極博一般顧客的詢問、足見　巧的廣告、和眞實的貨品、確能引人入勝、我們還記得這種新奇巧妙的廣告方法、只有華美烟公司、是常常用來調換新鮮空氣的、</p>
<p>安眠思床　廠的張徐兩君、殷殷導我們參觀該廠貨品的耐用和耐力而且把重達一百六十五斤的巨石、置掛床墊、毫不走樣、據說這貨、已得到國外的暢銷了、</p>
<p>他如中法大藥房和中西藥房特別的陳設、章華呢絨華成烟公司和中華琺瑯廠的裝璜和情美的出品、都足以媲美外貨咧、</p>
<h3>妻黨同惡　丈夫受苦不堪　不得已訴諸法院</h3>
<p>湖州人凌雲、係販賣動物為生、娶妻凌陳氏、卽陳招弟、係鹽城人、與其妻母陳孫氏·妻弟陳國良·又名大順子、同住在長安路德仁里十三號、俾取照應、不料妻黨同惡、將凌雲視同雄媳婦一般、非打卽駡、凌不勝其苦、上月底凌偶圖反抗、卽遭一干妻黨兇毆受傷、凌遂投地方法院、控其妻凌陳氏·妻弟陳國良·妻母陳孫氏·傷害、當奉檢察官騐明、提起公訴、昨日、由兪推事開庭訊問、凌雲瀝訴痛苦之情、質之被吿等否認行兇、官諭辯論終結、聽候宣判、</p>

<h3>「百年英里賽跑」　結果出人意外　美國洛馬尼壓倒羣雄　勒夫洛克克寗漢慘敗　—成績四分九秒—</h3>
<p>潑林斯登三日路透電　今日在包滿運動塲舉行之「百年之英里賽跑」中、美國世運長跑選手洛馬尼、於出人意料之外、將世界英里跑權威者勒夫洛克及克寗漢擊敗、</p>
<p>勒夫洛克落後二碼、列第二名、克寗漢更落後四碼、列第三名、洛馬尼之成績、為四分九秒、較克寗漢一九三四年六月十六日在潑林斯登造之世界紀錄多二秒十分之二、勒夫洛登之成績為四分十秒、克寗漢四分十三秒、</p>

<p>一九三五年在潑林斯登舉行第一次之「百年之英里賽跑」時、勒夫洛克將美國所有之主要長跑選手全部打倒、但當時所參加之巴斯隆（當時之千五百公尺紀錄保持者）范士斯·陶遜·及曼根等、今日俱未曾參加也、</p>
<h3>西聯足球甲組賽　東華昨勝西捕　三比一上半時一比一和局</h3>
<p>東華足球會、昨與西捕隊作西聯甲組賽于逸園、東華主將孫錦順　幼良歐遊雖已歸來、但因旅途勞頓、並以西捕歷為手下敗將、故仍以上週陣容應戰、結果上半時東華因右衛稍疏、致成一比一和局、下半時則陣容嚴緊、遂凈勝二球、總結果東華以三比一獲勝、孫賈昨日亦翩然蒞塲觀戰、下週將出陣應敵、小黑炭陳鎮和、自前日歸來後、亦有加入東華之說、十九可成事實、昨賽雙方陣容及戰情如下、</p>
<p>東華會</p>
<p>張榮才</p>
<p>李寗　莊維新</p>
<p>顧尚勸　馮運佑　舒士耕</p>

<p>鮑斯　梅氏</p>
<p>透納　陶勒斯　畢哥特</p>
<p>傑勃生　惠列　好來　德飛　佩特　奧克來</p>
<p>與　比</p>
<p>西捕先攻、西捕主將軋許未到、僅以十人應付、旋西捕右衛梅氏姍姍而來、凑成全軍、東華聲勢極盤、　攻未應、稍一失誤被西捕中鋒德飛越過防綫、臥地左傳、惠列疾馳而至、橫掃一脚、張榮才趕忙營救撲空、遂被西捕先開紀錄、距開賽尚祇八分鐘、東華努力反攻甚烈、馮運佑輸送、小萬派司、許文奎趕上一脚、馬到成功、成一比一、繼而雙方互有攻守、但東華勝面較多、以一比一結果上半時、</p>
<h3>東華連中</h3>
<p>再戰不久、東華薛許李三將先來一個美妙三角傳遞、惜以文繡脚頭欠硬、東華門前、又起駭浪、西捕鐵騎、滿佈門下、幸榮才奮身一躍、始告無恙、許文奎越過中綫、單騎直入、再中鵠的、一比一東華超前一球、西捕到處受敵、楚歌四面、李義臣萬象華相繼攻門均未建功、俄而西捕得任意球、德飛頭攻中柱彈出、德飛再頂、榮才接住、此為東華遭遇之最險之境、以後西捕漸形消沉、局熱遂又為東華操縱、惟萬象華遞交中路、麟經一馬趕到、在十碼處一蹴而入、遂以三對一結果獲勝、</p>
<h3>陜北運動會　雙十節舉行</h3>

<h3>滬交體聯會　籃球競賽開幕　招商電話郵政獲勝</h3>
<p>交通部上海各機關體育聯合會舉辦之首屆籃球錦標競賽、昨於申園籃球房開幕、計到有理事郵政局徐多、招商局陳緒良、國際電臺蔣堃、及來賓二百餘人、各隊均准時到塲、戰來均呈緊張、第一塲招商對郵匯、兩方實力似稍相差、招商一路佔先、上半時以二十一對九、獲勝於前、下半時郵匯隊體力不支、招商老將陳庸庵屢告中的、終以五十七比十二獲勝、第　塲電話歐亞之戰、雙方戰鬥力相等、比數僅一分上落、惜歐亞隊不諳規則、致犯規出有三名之多、在最後時間、因缺乏後援、以四人出戰、致為電話所乘、連失數球敗北、第三塲郵政對電報、戰來愈為緊張、郵政較為沉着、以十二比十一宣告勝利、</p>

<p>這一回在柏林舉行的第十一屆夏令配克大運動會、還算我自己是個幸運兒、不曾被躋到那落伍者的圈裏去、被選代表足球出席、更從這一次的參加、得以圓成我十年來時作時輟的遊歐大夢、回想起六年前樂華隊立志遊歐、而中道擱淺、那一回的意冷心灰、愈覺得這番的歐行、是額外甜美、</p>
<p>到現在倦鳥歸來、歐遊又成過去的事了、這一回旅程忽促沒有充份的時間和機會、來作較為微細詳盡的　察、這確是美中之不足、可是、在走馬看花的過程中、我們眼所見的、耳所聞的、也有不少糢糊紛亂的印象、尤其是對於各國的足球、因為我們的時間、泰半消磨在足球裏面、所接觸的又多屬與足球有密切關係的事情、印象所得、少不免比較關於其他像「社會」「文化」「建設」「風俗」等等是深切一些、而我這一篇「參加世運歐遊雜感、」也就是從那紛亂糢糊的印象裏面、用我記憶力追想出來的痕跡、我所寫的都是我個人的觀感、有不對的地方、還望各界指正、</p>
<p>夏令配克大會的主人國是德意志、大會的所在地是柏林、我們這番留歐、比較上在德國居停的時間最長、所聞所知所見和觀察事物的機會、也比較在他國多一點、所以在我這篇「歐遊雜感」、我要先把「復興的德意志」寫出來、我把我所知到的德意志的好處、臚舉於此、希望我國當其局者、能本「他山之石可以攻玉」的一種謀進取的精神、來採長截短、把全沒朝氣現在的中國、也復興起來、</p>
<p>我不敢說德國事事都祇有好、沒有壞的、不過最低限度、牠裏面是好的多、壞的少、好的浮露、易被人看見、壞的沉藏、不易任人發覺而已、何况在這一回大會中、環宇的外國人、盈千累萬地趕來集中柏林趁熱鬧、德政府自然提盡量　露出來、借這次的機緣、來作一番國際的大宣傳、德元首希德　說得好、「我們這次是主人、務望德國的朝野上下、要聯合起來、盡我們主人的職責、不要教有一位外人、在離德境的前後、有不滿意的地方、」由此可推想到德人這一回的準備、是何等週到、他們利用這次宣傳機會的希望、是何等偉大、</p>
<p>歐戰後幾乎立足不牢的德國、十幾年來、無日不在掙扎奮鬥中、在希德婁政和統治之下、完成今日復興的第三德意志、他們政治的機要、和軍事的秘密、當然是我們觀察不到的、現在我且把牠較為浮露顯著的美點、分列出來、</p>
<p>（一）清潔</p>
<p>一入德境、最先走入外人眼廉的、便是街衢的清潔、不管甚麼地方、他們都整理得一塵不染、差不是多睡在馬路上、也不會弄污你的衣裳、行人在道上、是沒有隨意吐痰的、有時馬路上發現了些果皮或字紙等物、行人們便爭先把牠拾起來投到路旁的箱裏、有時找不着字紙箱、竟拿進袋裏一塞、犧牲自己的衣服來維持公共的清潔、至於香烟屁股更不易得見、如果我國那些拾香烟尾的人、去德國尋生活的話、恐怕他們馬上要餓死、總之、清潔是初到德境最容易感覺到的事、尤其是我們看慣了中國內地的人、</p>
<p>（二）民族強健</p>
<p>德國健全的民族、也是極容易給外人看見的、男的固然都有雄偉的軀幹、活潑的精神、就是女的也表露着康健美和活躍的天真、牠們走路、都是胸部挺直、步伐爽快、駝背灣腰面帶菜色之流、是極少見得到的、婦女們也沒有嬌滴滴弱不禁風的姿態、她們是任隨身體的自然發育、盡量發揚天然美、搽脂抹粉的祇有極少的數量、或簡直是賣淫之輩、所以很多人說德國婦女太肥壯、不大好看、就因為她們不事修飾的緣故罷、德國的童子發育也奇速、十三四歲的小孩、差不多有我們成人般碩大、還記得有一次我們一位隊友跑到某百貨公司男子部、要買卅二號大的內衣、那理貨員却很客氣地對他說、「先生對不起、請你到童子部去買、這裏成人部的內衣、起碼是卅六號的、」從這一點可以推想到他們魁梧的體格了、「健全之精神、寓於健全的體魄、」有了健全的精神、才幹得出偉大的事業、我們自問平均的體格、確屬過於文質彬彬、</p>
<p>（三）守時刻</p>
<p>守時刻是德國人處世的第一信條、我和狠多德國朋友約會、從沒有見他們失約或逾時、有幾次我們要專車去球塲練習、到遲了三兩分鐘、便車影也不見、後來我們交涉、反得着一塲好教訓、那管理車輛的人說、「我們的車子是駛到的定的地點去守時刻的、我們并不是駛去那裏候人、」他的意思、是如果一輛車子是在那邊逾時守候、便會阻塞着後方的交通、倒亂了全部的秩序、到後來我們祇有提前赴約、情願早點去等候車子開來、無論甚麼敘會或飱會、也是逾時不候的、如果我們以中國式的時間、去應人家的飱敘、恐怕你入門人家便散席了、這一點是我國人最大的毛病、他們不徇情的守候習慣、是我們最應該彷效的、</p>
<p>（四）守秩序</p>
<p>守秩序也是德人美德之一、在這大會期間柏林的人口突然澎漲起來、但無論在車站、在戲院、在飱館、在運動塲、在沽票處、雖然是擠擁得不堪、也沒有紛亂的狀態、秩序的整齊、用不着警察來指引或壓迫的、馬路上肩摩踵接、人人都極守規則、由街邊不能胡亂穿過大路走那一邊的、過馬路要先站在十字街頭、等候着信號、才能任行、否則給警察看見是要罰錢的、尤其是在買票房的門口、那秩序看見了真令人暗暗生羨、他們一排排地靜候自己的輪值的來臨、從不爭前恐後、佔他人的便宜、去搶先一步、這公共塲所的秩序、也是國人所忽略的、</p>
<p>（五）教育普及</p>
<p>德國人差不多是沒有文盲的、無論士農工商最低限度、能看報紙、而且十之六七、是懂英文、我們居留在德境、並不感覺到言語隔膜的蔴煩、聽說他們中學裏兼學英法或臘丁文字、他們教育程度之高、可以推測了、他們因為、書知所以便深知禮義、他們對那問事問路的外國人、總是客氣而且竭力帮忙的、我們初到柏林踏上地底電車、並不知去向、我們茫然無主的侷促窮態、却給隣坐的一位老人看見了、他還開始動問我們要去的地方、很虔誠地答應領導我們、到了臨別向他道謝的時候、我好奇地問他是否也同走一路、他說『我自己的目的地已過了三個站頭了、但這是無妨、十分鐘的工夫、我便可以回到那邊』、他們敬禮外賓、有如此者、　（未完）</p>

<h3>中國經濟建設問題</h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>一　前言</p>
<p>談起中國經濟，尤其是中國經濟建設問題，那真是千頭萬緒，有着無限的複雜性，不僅一般人多是攪不清楚，就連所謂學者專家們，也由於各自主觀立塲以及寒舍環境的不同，各　各的意見，始終沒有肯定的一致的結論。過去，曾經有過中國經濟機購的論戰；接着，便是所謂農業化？抑工業化？以至放任？統制？利用外資？等等，不一而足。最近，關於中國人口過剩不過剩？土地够不够？富源多不多？等幾點，又展開了廣汎的具體的論爭，益使中國經濟建設問題加倍　複。</p>
<p>但這裏，我們要指出一部份人所犯最重大最普遍的毛病：第一，有的竟把中國經濟放在和先進資本主義國家同一的模型上，而忽略了中國經濟自有的物質；根本立塲既然不正確，因此，不管讓他們談什麼化或什麼路綫，都會走上極嚴重的錯誤的道路。第二，有的老實不懂經濟發展的法則，尤其一般俗流經濟學者，　在他們非常狹隘的理論中，永遠不會解剖出當前這個極形錯綜複雜的經濟社會；所以要這種人來談中國經濟建設，那無異盲人騎瞎馬。第三，有的估量中國物質環境實在太屬近視，真所謂具有「學者」的獃氣，他們往往只憑着主觀所知道，便浮面地即下論斷；　如，就中國的人口，土地，富源等讓，他們估計中國可用的土地實在太覺貧弱，同時，對於中國的富源，也似乎只看見樹木而望不見森林。第四有的太重崇拜偶像，多以為凡是「專家」，「學者」說的話都是對的，於是，不問「專家」「學者」放的是什麼東西，毫不猶豫的拾為至實，未恐不及，甚至奉作討論問題的標凖論據；這樣，就跟着也走錯路了。</p>
<p>我們覺得要研究中國經濟，討論中國經濟建設問題，至少對於下列幾個重要的前提，是必不可絲毫加以忽略的，就是：</p>
<p>必須了解中國經濟的物質，卽中國特有的經濟機構究竟是怎樣的。</p>
<p>必須認清當前中國經濟恐慌的根本因素，卽中國經濟究竟為什麼會到了這種地步？</p>
<p>對於中國物質環境必須具體地認識正確，這是經濟建設上必要的條件。</p>
<p>二　中國經濟的物質及其恐慌</p>
<p>中國經濟的物質，這還是四年多以前所熱烈論爭着的問題，當時論解結果，雖然沒有確切的結論，但對於中國經濟是「半封建的半殖民地經濟」這一點，似乎已為大多數人所公認了這裏我們本無重行檢討的必要；但是，很痛心的，庸俗的見解在中國經濟的領域中，直到恨前還是佔着相當的勢力，而作理論的頑抗。因此，不得不使我們在研討中國經濟建設問題的當兒，仍須把中國經濟的物質來提示一下。</p>
<p>中國經濟範疇裏面所包含着的成分，真是太複雜了，主要是：　半封建的農業經濟，　脆弱的民族工業，　帝國主義的各種經濟勢力。這些，相互地交織着而形成了這一畸形的中國經濟機構——半封建的，前資本主義的，半殖民地經濟。</p>
<p>原來，中國雖然也受着資本主義的狂流所侵襲，但國內的生產關係，却仍舊停滯於封建由授受而相當裏現着資本主義的樣式，可是土地剝削關係，則依然建立於封建基礎之上。他們對立的兩方，不是單屬佔有生產工具而榨取剩餘價值的資本家和全無生產工具而出賣勞力的勞動者；乃是：一方係依靠封建式榨取為生存的軍閥、地主，豪紳，高利貸者，商業資本家等等，另一方面是被榨取的廣大數的佃農，貧農，沒落的中農，手工業者等等。至於各種商品在農村中的進出，這誠然相當資本主義化了的。但僅止於單純的流通過程，只是帝國主義的商品經濟（傾銷商品，奪取原料）通過買辦資本，商業資本而表現於農村社會的上面而已；它根本不能跟生產關係相混同，它並沒有推翻原有的關係。</p>
<p>封建勢力和帝國主義是相互地勾結着的：軍閥地主，豪紳，商業資本家等等，是　着帝國主義以維持其政治生命和經濟生命；帝國主義則通過軍閥，地主，豪紳，商業資本家等等，而奠定其政治的勢力，完成其商品的傾銷，和原料的獲取。這樣，中國農村在帝國主義和封建勢力雙重壓榨之下，當然一天天貧乏起來了。不僅無法改良技術和增加生產，抑且甚至不能維持其低級的再生產，所以中國農業經濟的崩潰是必須的，絕非偶然。有些認為中國的土地不够維持中國的人口，這顯然不是正確的說法，實際上，絕對不是中國土地不够，而是生產不發達。忽略了這一點，就不　談中國的人口問題和土地問題，不配談中國經濟建設問題。</p>
<p>在前述箭形之下，中國民族工業自然也就無從健全的發展了。帝國主義的廉價商品（從其本國輸入或在中國設廠製造）不單摧毀中國原有的手工業，更使一切新式工業不能抬頭。只在歐戰時代，各國因忙於應付各自的戰爭，無力顧遠東市塲的經營，中國民族工業曾經獲得短期的滋長：可是，　花一現，戰後依舊被帝國主義勢力所壓倒。工業發展必須以廣大的市塲為斟礎的，中國既無力量可以運往國外　銷，同時，國內自己的市塲又被帝國主義所侵奪；試問：中國民族工業怎麼能够繁榮起來呢！</p>
<p>帝國主義勢力控制了中國的一切，不論農業工業以及交通等各方面，甚至政治上，都有帝國主義的魔手；一面，國內反動的封建勢力又依靠了帝國主義的扶植，頑強地存續着。就這樣，中國經濟便不能獲得正規的發展。中國民族資本是非常地微弱的，佔有勢力者，倒還是帝國主義卵翼下的買辦資本。這又是半殖民地下的特殊形態。</p>
<p>明白了中國經濟的物質，則對於中國經濟銎慌的因素也就攫住了一大半。我們已經知道：中國經濟是在帝國主義和封建勢力的勾結之下被把持着；這種　變的結局，必然會產出下列幾種現象：　農村經苛重的榨取而破產，農民大衆　極度貧乏化；　民族工業受壓迫而破碎，失業工人大批投向街頭；　由於上列兩原因，促使購買力激劇的減退，從而商業衰落，生產停滯，信用呆阻……釀成不可收拾的局面。這是中國經濟恐慌的根因。所以，中國經濟恐慌並不是一朝一夕繼出來的事情，那是老早就開展着，係由慢性轉變到急性。</p>
<p>其次，我們更絕對不能忽視最近帝國主義加緊侵略下面促成大恐慌的嚴重性。中國經濟是世界經濟的一環，世界經濟之每一變動，都會直接間接的影響中國的經濟活動。但中國經濟並不是自主的，上面說過，中國是半殖民地，所以祇能以附庸的從屬的資格，作為世界經濟的副環。籽這個原故，中國竟又做了世界經濟恐慌的排洩所，資本主義國家是儘量將自已的恐慌轉嫁到殖民地半殖民的身上的；因之，中國經濟恐慌便愈益嚴重。</p>
<p>除了一般的加緊商品傾銷等手段外，帝國主義在最近所加到中國身上的，而使中國產生去夏以來巨大的經濟恐慌之具體的　　，誰都知道主要係下列幾點：即　前年美國的白銀政策，　英國的金鎊活動，　還在積極進行中的某帝國主義的軍事侵略。美國白銀政策曾經加速了中國白銀的外流，英國的金鎊活動曾經推動中國信用恐慌達到更高度，這些在不久以前所表現的作用，都無由否認。但頂頂致命傷的，當推某帝國主義的軍事侵略！東北四省淪亡，察北冀東變色，使我們喪失數百萬方哩的土地及其富源，數千萬的人口及其購買力；次之，淞滬侵入震撼了中國金融中心地，加增了中國經濟恐慌。長城各口戰役以及其後在冀察境內種種的搗亂，破壞了華北經濟的命胍。以後治上以威　為主，在軍事作為後盾的險惡局面之下，不要說中國經濟前途，完全送掉，連國家地位亦不堪設想的了。</p>
<p>三　中國經濟的出路</p>
<p>關於解救中國經濟恐慌的工作，最近各方所表現着的，的確不為不努力；不過，如僅止於消極的不澈底的辦法，則縱使能治標於一時，却依舊救不了中國經濟的厄運。所以，有許多人就提出了中國經濟積極建設的意見；但對於建設的路綫問題，各方派別繁多，真有五花八門的現象。譬如：在重心上有重農主義派和重工主義派，工農並重派；在體制上如資本主義派，社會主義派，民生主義派；在方式上有放任主義派，統制經濟派等等。　裏我們就重農重工為出發點，來把中國經濟應走的途徑檢討一下吧：</p>
<p>重工主義派則以為留戀於農業為開倒車的行動，覺得中國必須跟着先進資本主義國家積極地工業化，中國經濟才有繁榮的可能，並謂自己工業發達，入超自然而然會杜絕不見。也有主張先工而後農者，却和上述先農而後工的見解正相反，他們認為工業建設係農業建設的基礎，農業上所產生的原料，必須在工業發達上　求銷路，同時，農業方面應需的機械，技術等等，必須工業發達之後始可供給。</p>
<p>我深深地覺得，上面兩派大家都有些僞見，我們應該放大賬光看現　，中國不僅農業急需救濟，工業也是急需救濟；中國不僅工業急需救濟，農業也是急需救濟，我們斷不能偏於任何一方。且兩者根本像手和臂一般，不應硬生生地分開。農業之依靠工業，和工業之依靠農業，是同樣地緊密的。工業建設固然需要農業上所產出的原料及農村中廣大的市塲；農業建設也是脫不掉工業發達為其銷售原料　供給機械技術。所以，問題不在於機械地農業化或工業化，也不在於個別地誰先誰後，而應該手臂並進。現代許多資本主義國家，它們雖然工業繁榮，却也並沒有忽略農業，美國為其最顯著者；從使有幾國是特別側重於工業，但它們有農來的殖民地和平半殖民地為其調劑，商品有地方銷售，原料有地方收取，是建築於剝削或榨殖民地半殖民地之上的。中國如果單純工業化，請問向誰去剝削？中國雖道將有餘力來爭奪別人的市塲，獲取別人的原料嗎？又，蘇聯本來固應視為農業國，但它的兩次五年計畫中，却同樣重視工業，而致力於雙生的建設，現在已經成了一個農工俱盛的繁榮國家了。中國如果單純農業化，則只配一單　做供養原料資源的殖民地而已。是的，也許有人會提出：「中國沒有資力把兩者兼顧，所以祇能從事解决一種。」這係似是而非，我們上面已經說過，農工兩者不能機械地個別分開，單獨一路會由於沒有相互輔助而遭遇了更深重的困難；相反的，倘使兩者能够調和，呼應，則其所耗費的資力，實際反會减少。譬如：在發展棉紡織業的時候，如果本國產棉豐富優良而又配置得當，就不必多一筆漏　而爺給外來的輸入；同樣，棉產條件既完備，如果本國的紡織業發達，就不致被人大量地以廉價收去了。（自然，現時華北菗花被奪，尙有政治的因素）</p>
<p>不過，我却並不是像許多農工並重派者，要想把中國的農業和工業都資本主義化，或　在封建制度下發展農業，資本主義制度下發展工業。（事實上，農業要在舊有封建社會的生產關係上發展，那是絕不可能；而一面存在着農業的封建關係，一面要發展醬主義，也是不可能的事情。）對於醬主義化和維持封建制度，我都反對。我們固然須推翻舊有的封建社會，但不一定要　板地一步一步跟着走那已趨沒落的醬主義之路。我們應該直接朝那沒有剝肺活量的方向進行。</p>
<p>這裏我們要轉而提到中國可耕土地的够不够問題了。很好笑的，竟有不少人盲目地跟着高唱中國土地跟人口不够分配，進而斷定了中國農業建設為不可能，這真是罕有的怪論！</p>
<p>據幾位「學者」「」專家的估計：中國可耕土地最大限度不出九十萬方哩，除山　，河湖，城鎮，第宅，道路等等大約百分之二三十，全國真正能够耕種的土地只多七十萬方哩，約合三十萬萬畝左右，除已耕約十四萬萬畝許，未耕者僅尙有十五六萬萬畝。他們認定中國可耕地大都限於東中南，西北幾全屬不毛之區，而僅僅把它們算入五六萬方哩，約合二萬萬餘畝。這和實際的情形相差得太遠了，正如張廷休行不行所說：「單單檢出一片不毛區域來代表西北，正如中央攝影塲只用沙漠牛羊來代表新疆蒙古的文化，一樣令人感着無限的遺憾！」（見中山文化敎育館季刊第三卷第三期本年秋委號張著中華民族之量與質）</p>
<p>其實，西北固多砂鹹地帶，但可耕之地也正不少。單據最近調查察哈爾的內八旗北部，錫林郭勒盟十旗，達　岡厓，綏遠的前後套沃野三湖灣，陝西的黃龍山，永壽，漢中，甘肅的甘凉肅三州，平凉　州，寗夏的額爾濟納土爾扈特旗，靑海的都蘭，玉樹，西寗，柴達木一帶，聞可墾古，新疆，西康，西藏等土地，也决不致有如一般人所想像的惡劣。被認為一片沙漠的外蒙古，據蘇聯專家調查，證明這個荒涼地方可由科學的灌溉而轉變為豐　的農耕地；又據到過新疆的人親口說，該處肥沃之地着實不少，尤其是從迪化到伊　一　，更適宜於生產。至於西康和西藏，雖係地勢高而氣候又多惡劣，但基川穀貫注處，仍有不少可以耕種的地方，決不是像某學者所說的絕無可用。</p>
<p>所以，中國有用的土地實在很多很多。復據美國人貝克氏（O．E．Bader)估計。全中國尙有可墾地二十五萬萬畝，約相當於現有耕地兩三倍。其餘，全中國可耕土地之未統計的以及未覺的，不知更有多多少少，如果我們調查工作做得好，調查技術弄得完備，那一定有　人的揭示吧。據脫寗夏在未淸丈以前，有墾地八十萬畝，淸丈後已墾者已達二百萬畝，較原數擴展三倍還多，可知調查測量的重要。</p>
<p>未來的發展又正未可限量的，科學克服自大　業已數見不鮮，現在認為的確不能耕作的地方，以後未必永遠不會成為有用的肥沃地。我們看西伯利亞吧，不論就氣候上或地域上，昔日都被認作荒漠不能生產，而只配做囚犯充軍的絕境；可是，目前却被蘇關開發得非常可觀了，集體農塲在廣大的區域上耕作着耕地是一天天擴大。同樣，我們的蒙古，新疆，康藏以及西北各省，如能經過一番精密的調查和測量，也是很可樂觀的。我們决不應自暴自棄，反讓別人喧奪主。</p>
<p>中國有這樣的廣大的肥沃的土地，誰說中國不能踏上農業建設！（更不要忘了已失去的最肥沃的處女東北四省！）</p>
<p>也有人提出中國每年糧食入起而作為土地不够的例證，這是百分之百的荒謬。他們不單抹煞了中國尙有大批未耕的良地，更忽略了中國土地生產的特殊性。在帝國主義的壓迫　封建勢的把持之下，中國土地生產力之不曾發展到應有的高度，這是非常明顯的事實。據說，丹麥每畝小麥的生產量約合三九三·三二斤，而中國只有一二三·〇　〇　斤，相差三倍有餘，大麥生產丹麥為三六四斤，中國一三五斤，馬鈴　丹麥二三六八斤，中國七五一斤。其次，中國由於運輸工具的落後，以致分配不當及　置，腐爛等等，也都為促成糧食不够吃的因子。而且實際糧食入超的數類在總消費量中是非常微小的，據張印堂先生就近十年來輸入的糧食估計，最多的年份僅估我國糧食消費量的百分之三左右（本年四月張氏在清華大學演講民族自數運動中之食糧問題）。要　救這一些數字，我們如能稍稍調節均勻或略改良生產也就得了。所以，單從貿易上來看中國土地問題是顯然極其不當的。</p>
<p>總之，中國農業建設難以　可不必愁土地的不够，而只須掃除建設牟阻力。</p>
<p>此外，復有說中國鑛產貧乏，而斷定中國不能實行工業建設的，更有說中國人低能無用而不配談任何建設的，種種自暴自棄的怪論，真是舉不勝舉，這裏無暇多來分述。</p>
<p>自然，在經濟建設（不論農業或工業）這前以及建設牟過程中，我們必須再提到上述封建勢力和帝國主義的阻撓問題。封建分子是絕對不願意中國經濟作着前進的建設的，這會破壞固有的生產關係，而影響他們不當的利益。譬如：地主就是靠舊的剝削關係來維持生存的，所以他們根本反對土地的重分配與任何革新；甚至不想土地生產上的改良，因為生產改良之後，農產物價格低落，會影響他們所收的地租。</p>
<p>帝國主義者則一面和封建分子相勾結，阻凝中國經濟正常的建設，和社會合理的改革，而支持了封建的反動勢力，一面復積極摧殘中國工業和農業的發展，他們從外面運來的或在中國內地設廠製造的廉價商品，非僅壓倒中國民族工業的抬頭，且深入農村，而使整個農村破產。還不只限於單純的這一些，幾年來經濟的政治的軍事的並行侵略之下，我們的一切都受別人任意的割宰屠戮，連伸腰的機會也沒有了，那裏還可以給我們好好地建設！</p>
<p>所以，中國經濟建設上最重要的問題還不在機械的重農重工，而是在於這些惡勢力的梗阻。我們高談建設的時候，如果忘却了這二大主要的高敵人，以及當前的民族危機；則一切便都等於空話。總括地說：中國如果不將封建勢力剷除，帝國主義勢力消　，經濟建設的前途是沒有多大的希望的。這不是我們有意悲觀，尤是期跟眼大的外敵！</p>
<p>四、國際合作和經濟提携</p>
<p>最後，我們要附帶的論及國示間的合作和所謂經濟提携問題。我們當然不想死扳扳「閉戶造車」（實際這也是不可能）所以對於國際間的合作以及外國的援助，是竭誠表示歡迎的。不過，合作須絕對平等，援助須絕無損害中國主權的條件。我們願意接受外國好意的貨欵和投資；然而不能以此來作操縱中國財政和把握中國富源的工具。倘使違反了上述基本原則，則一切都應該為中國人民所反對。尤是最近頂熱鬧的合作其名侵略其實的所謂「經濟提携」（特別是華北方面），我們實在不敢領受盛情，無疑的，這將斬斷中國經濟的命脈！並不是我們故意危言聳聽，乃係不可掩蓋的鐵的事實和必然的發展。表面上，經濟提携的任務非常動聽。什麼帮助中國發展交通啦，開發富源啦，救濟農民啦，安定財政金融啦，……似乎應該感激得五體投地；可是，真真的內容怎樣呢？看吧：</p>
<p>第一，所謂建設參差錯落通路綫者，是預備把中國的富藏大量大量地迅速載運出口，把××的商品大量大量地普遍傾銷內地，而鐵路又為軍事上頂主要工具，在繼續侵略過程上，它要擔任非常重大的任務。如津石鐵路的作用，在經濟上是加速運出沿路的農產品及山西的煤產，並加速運入××的商品；在軍事上則貫通了北寗，津浦，平漢，正太四綫而　於戰時輸送。</p>
<p>第二，所謂開發鑛產者，就是要把中國蘊藏着的實物尤其　是煤鐵等都掠奪過去，給它發展工業，給它製造大砲機關槍以及一切殺人的利器。據說，山西的煤，察哈爾的鐵，河北的金，山東的銀銅等，便是最初步的對象物。</p>
<p>第三，所謂改良農產品者，决不是救濟中國農民，而是榨取中國農民，它要中國農民一輩子做它的奴隸，主要是以廉價收買棉·麥·羊毛等農產物，去解决它的原料恐慌和糧食恐慌，並為未來戰爭作　備。</p>
<p>第四，××不僅用其本國所生產的商品以走私（現在已經不是走私了）！方式來傾銷，而且積極地在中國國內設廠，就地製造，把中國僅有的民族工業都想　行摧毀，天津華商紡織的沒落，便　是最好的說明。除棉紡織業外，次之是毛織工業電氣工業·火柴工業·麵粉工業·人造絲工業·玻璃工業·陶磁工業以及各種化學工業機械工業等，無不計劃　汛的擴展。</p>
<p>第五，所謂援助安定中國財政金融者，就是要支配中國經濟的靈魂；援助實卽破壞，阻　幣制統一，把持華北現銀，以及以走私方式割裂中國關稅的　　，無一不是破壞財政金融而使陷於破碎的局面，俾有利於　個　略的進行。</p>
<p>要之，提携是侵略的化身，雖中國五尺之童亦知之。又有所謂「工業××，農業中國」者，中國永遠只配做殖民地而已。這也許就是某經濟專家所說敎授跟包車失之「平等互利」的合作！但誰願　一輩子做包車夫！</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3>判明兩性間性愛的重要</h3>
<p>……夫婦間精神之愛遠不敵性愛健全的歡洽　……如性愛不全難免同床異夢良姻變成怨冤</p>
<p>在從前以妻為供玩品時代，當然歡迎織弱嬌怯的美人；但現在時代變了：婦人應有相當活動，在家許中要敎養子女，對外也能為男子擁護者，鼓勵者，自然地現今擇妻的標凖也隨之改變——由丰姿之美，一變而為健康的美，這種傾向，真是一件很可喜的現象。這固然是適應自然的要求所起的一種必然趨勢，但也未嘗不是因為個人的體騐所獲得的正確結果。</p>
<p>實際上，健康美（優於容—貌美）是夫婦間最重大的要素——能營完全生殖，且夫妻能偕老百年。夫婦間的和好，無疑地以性愛為根據，所以夫婦雙方都都不能輕視性愛，欲使伉儷間的性愛美滿，先决問題，必須雙方的身體健全，性機能完備，然後始能發生真的夫婦之愛，而將來也無憂不能生育健全的後嗣了。</p>
<p>雖然，精神的愛也是夫婦間所不可缺少者，根據西方的著名學者研究，證明精神的愛不過性愛的附屬而已。如性愛不全，那末精神的愛也無從一致了，這真是至理明言！</p>
<p>的確，每對夫妻如個個能有健全的性愛，那末不單恩如膠漆，也樂如魚水了。而且國家的人種也不難達到優秀的水凖，尤其在新婚時代，這種性愛不全的弊害更易發生，常見有新婚時期尙未渡過，女的因男的性愛不全，竟吿分離的。雖任憑你精神的愛怎樣濃厚，而結果仍然要同床異夢，要無非你知害而治好，方可白頭偕老。</p>
<p>關於性愛不全的根本原因，屬於男方者：（一）不育不全，陰莖短小；（二）早洩與陰萎。屬於女方者：（一）妻子患有不感症；（二）生殖器異態；（三）發育不全，乳房萎　，</p>
<p>現在逐一來說明，男女的發育不全，除屬於先天的體虛之外，多數因過度手淫的影響。如遺精過久，因此一切新陳代謝機能停止此外。陰萎與早洩，為神經衰弱者所常有的現象，婚前的手淫及淋病，為罹患本症的重要原因。德國著名的性病專家Westcott氏，根據多年實騐而證實，最可靠的療法，以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最佳可恢復完美强壯的發育使神經衰弱症根本治好，陰萎早洩永被驅除，罹有遺精者以『希米脫氏固精片』治之，如原因屬於淋濁之故，則黃色素和伐辛合製劑『安敵淋』為對症的特效藥，氏曾在一月中用上述等法，治愈性愛不全者最多時共達二千七百七十四人，最少時亦有一千〇五十一人。此法幾為全球各醫家所公認。氏又過其中之一。美國杜素爾氏醫學博士，彼曾在一九三五年三月份，用『生殖素』及『安敵淋』與『希米脫氏固精片』三藥治愈同樣病症竟達四千〇十九人之多，與威氏較之，幾多過一倍，故威氏的紀錄實不足為廳也。（編者按，生殖素固精片真貨槪裝鐵盒，慎勿　購紙盒僞品）</p>
<p>戒烟心得</p>
<h3>最新流行的戒煙法</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>是具有安全有效的特點　是戒煙難忍痛苦的福音</p>
<p>處於這科學昌明的現代，無論什麼都較十九世紀為進步，即以戒煙一端而言，在往昔，用盡腦汁要想把它戒除的確不是一件容易的事，試想一個多病的人，他完全藉着鴉片的麻醉而活動，煙毒已深，假使要呌他一時戒絕，不　要他的生命還要難過，這都因他每個神經都種了煙的毒害，如若不吸煙而生殖腺內分泌又極其涸缺，生命的泉源卽失了保障與抵搞的力量，那有不百病業集的道理，故有一般吸煙的人要想戒而不敢戒，無非就為了這個緣故，可是，二十世紀是科學世界，不用憂慮了，最新流行的培補戒煙法；世界各國政府都藉以戒除煙民，而且施行也很簡單，祇要投以大量的生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』並注射『育維賜保』使促進生殖腺的健全，以增强抵搞煙毒與外來疾病侵入的力量，不消二月，卽可無絲毫痛苦的戒絕，曾有梁潔民者，四十歲，廣東人，前因胃病而吸煙，成癮已將廿年，屢次要想戒除，總因不能忍受痛苦而未果，經余用培補戒煙法施戒，投以『生殖素』一月餘，同時注射『育維賜保命』，安全戒絕，身體更逐漸健壯，出於意料云。</p>

<h3>乳癟女子的科學補救</h3>
<p>— 國際生理學界權威蘇聯巴符洛夫原著，俄文名Ivan　Petrovich　Pavlov，周笑涵醫師節譯</p>
<p>……乳峯的發育為健美的主要條件　……各國學者的埋產學研苦幹法術精進　……倫敦有十餘萬乳癟女性得健美</p>
<p>自從現代的人們，改變了美的觀點，重視健康美之後，以前女性的　　弱質，完全根本推翻。關於女性健美的條件，這裏包含有幾點，如體重與身高的關係，以及肌肉組織的健全與否，姿態的丰腴，與夫胸部，臀部的發達，均為求健美者所不可少。然此幾點，尙不能謂為主要條件，在女性健康美上佔有極重要的權威者，厥為乳峯，乳峯如能隆然高聳，彈力結實，不但曲線畢露，美的姿態盡顯於外，而女子的健康基礎也就鞏固異常。美國最著名的生理學家葛拉素博士（Grasoel　M．D．）一九三四年曾有一篇「女性健美的演進」除歷述女子健美的必要之外，對於乳峯的發育方法，並加以詳細的證明，如俄國有名的美容專家沙寗氏Sanine美國的美容專家赫斯亭博士Milo　Hasting　M．D．，英國著名的醫學博士蘇菲臘札費爾德氏，及德國生理學家拉比克氏Lrpicque等均一致認明女子的乳房萎癟及胸部平坦，完全為生殖腺衰弱之關係，故彼等研究生殖腺素製劑的運用，已非朝夕，直至一九三二年奧國生理學家斯丹那氏，得政府的獎助，發明真正純粹生殖腺素女用「生殖素」之後，始得一可靠的乳癟對症良藥，經上述的國際幾位學者實騐採用之後，斯丹那氏之名，遂一躍千丈，歐美學者，均一致譽為國際的生理學大師，各國政府均紛紛頒給獎狀，因該藥不僅能助長發育，對於女性的月經症及不姙症，均有顯著的效果，計祇倫敦一地，在一九三五年一年中藉此製劑治愈乳癟，不姙，月經異常的女子竞達一萬六千七百四十五人之多。</p>
<h3>淋病可靠的短期治愈</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>淋病的侵害人體，實較梅毒有過之而無不及。如感染淋病後能致攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，前後尿道炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，及輸卵管閉塞等症，以致滅種絕嗣，關於可靠的療法，根劇世界最著名的花柳病專家的臨床經騐如英國淋病學者布勞蘇氏Plom　ｏ，德國著名醫學博士達樂氏C．Darrow　M．D．法國花柳病專家E．Laurent博士等，曾經在五千次淋病診療時所得的經騐，證實各種淋病藥的成分，能符合於理想的功效者，以黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」為最佳。彼三位專家曾共同聯合試騐，在五知個患者之中，服「安敵淋」治療者，佔四千〇九十五人之多，並有極詳細的比率表登載於德國的Lhe　Venereal　Diseases內，本刊為限於編幅，不能全部登出，祇錄其一小部分，以供參考。</p>

<p>手淫遺精之惡果</p>
<p>患者陳峴元，年廿六歲，山東濟寗人，主訴——十五歲發育時，淸　漸開，淫　淫　，搜羅無數，早夕閱看，甚至飲食不思，更受劣友之引誘，手淫卽行開端，戒絕後復患遺精，迄今未愈，身體瘦弱不堪，記憶薄弱，失眠產學研暈，終日昏悶，腰疲背痛，備嗜痛苦，而發育因此受阻，性器更渺小異常，擬於今科結婚，惶恐異常，請求速治，病歷——初犯手淫時，徒知一時快感，詎意習慣即成自然，每夜必犯一次，旋即感神思恍忽，夢交愈多，三年後，頓覺面部瘦削，精神不支，其時已稍具知識，知必危及終身，駭然戒絕，而遺精遞發，先僅每月四五次之夢遺，及後變為滑精，循至日必一次，以故百病業生，衰弱不堪，現在症——精關寬鬆，性神經衰弱並麻卑，生殖腺損喪不堪，治療——實行其根本療法，先投以固精聖藥『希米脫氏固精片』以治遺安神，再投以『生殖素』以培補所耗精元，及扶助發育，同時並施行電療，手術，使性神經恢復常態，治療二月，遺精絕跡，身體復健，發育亦充足云，</p>
<p>未老先衰之補救</p>
<p>患者吳浩秋，年卅十二歲，本地人，主訴——余因幼時家庭甚窘，故於營養向不注意，且帮同長者操勞，發育被阻，十七歲即患遺精，初固不知其名，及後因偶一勞動，或思慮過切，至夜必遺，因之方知决非佳象，十九歲結婚迄今，十餘年來因奔走衣食，勞力過度，遺精迄未停止，尤使人寒心者，兩鬢斑白，疎疎脫落，而色蒼黃，北曲酸痛，四肢不適，腎虧盜汗，精神萎頓，衰老異常，已如五十許人，不勝駭慚，請治，現在症——生殖腺衰弱，內分泌失調，治療——除施行電療，手術外，投以大量之『生殖素』使恢復健全之生殖腺，並服『希米脫氏固精片』以治遺精，治療約五十日，名部顯現活躍，尤以面頰紅潤，髪黑如墨，體格魁梧，衰老俱退云</p>
<p>助我發育</p>
<p>浙江與化北大街五十二號劉君來函云：手淫二載，我的發育就被摧殘，身體性器，涉小猶如孩童，廿餘歲的人自己真覺羞愧，後經友介紹　得「生殖素」五盒，依法內服，一月後各部顯有充分發育，尤其對於人道，勝任自如，真良藥也。</p>
<p>胃痛得愈</p>
<p>雲南元謀縣西門大街集興號沈元龍君來函云：余患胃痛，已近五載，屢治無效，後托滬友購來「胃痛靈」並「健胃素」各三瓶，服之疼痛立止，食慾亢進，食而不滯，亦無吐酸作噎等狀·且三月未發，心感無比。</p>
<p>白帶良藥</p>
<p>江西景德鎮陸潔如女士來函云：余於去年偶然患病，下部忽現白帶，其後身體愈弱，流量愈多，且現赤血，後幸外子購回「療帶靈」一藥外用，並內服「女用生殖素」未及一月，白帶淨絕，體亦復健，誠為婦女的良藥，用以吿同病姊妹。</p>
<p>骨痛不發</p>
<p>四川江律北街裕成糧行經理張君來函云：余年五十二歲，骨痛已廿年，惟處於窮鄉避壞，不得良醫良藥·故迄未得治，幸經至戚沈君介紹服「强斯登氏骨痛片」，三瓶服完，所患霍然，現半年未發，實骨痛藥中之明星，殊感其靈效無匹也。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>骨痛須知</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>一百個老人中　九十九個患骨痛　欲求確切的治療　應循醫藥的正軌</p>
<p>骨痛與年老的人是結着不解的綠，因為他們在年靑時代，過份的勞力與飽經風火的侵襲，往往不大關心，因之日復一日的積累起來，一時年老力衰，一生蝕骨的勞傷瘋濕，就慢慢的透出骨來，提案　時逢節，勞作天陰，毫不爽約的使你疼痛　麻，尤其是四肢與背脊，疫痛更烈，更有因年靑時性喜漁色，就種了花柳餘毒，血份不潔，血毒內蘊，也能促成骨痛，而且比勞動過度所得的骨痛為痛苦難治，故人一到年老，百分之九十九都免不了這種病痛，患了非但受盡痛楚，而且百感不便。</p>
<p>自「强斯登氏骨痛片」部世後，往昔難於治療的骨痛，現在可以毫無問題的迅速治愈，無論老少骨痛，瘋濕骨痛，關節疫痛，腰北骨痛，舉凡各種疼痛疫麻，無不藥到病除。</p>
<p>患者劉福明，患骨痛達十餘年，一年廿四節氣，節節要發，疫痛難受，醫藥治療殆遍，絲毫不减痛楚，經余介紹其服「强斯登氏骨痛片」四瓶，骨痛非但獲愈，且四肢輕健，勝如少年云。</p>

<h3>思春期的男性手淫</h3>
<p>— （德國醫學博士張君實）</p>
<p>大凡已達思春期的男子，生殖機能業已發育齊全的靑年，都有手淫行為，不過弊害的程度不等。手淫過分耽溺者，病理的遺精難免。神經衰弱症遂相繼爆發。</p>
<p>遺精致病的原因，因為人生精液的主要成分，為蛋白質，脂肪質，無機鹽類等固形成分，此項固形成分的來源，係由睾丸製造供給，因副睾丸的作用，從輸精關輸出，儲蓄於精囊中，如遺精過多，及手淫房事過度均能使精液消耗，於是腦脊髓及神經系統逐步枯竭，釀成神經衰弱及發育不全，陰萎早洩等症狀，治療當然中是件不可容緩的事，關於遺精的藥劑療法，根據各國著名的性病專家如馬林克司及威而姆克氏等，必須從固精培補着手，以「希米脫氏固精片」止治遺精，同時以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」培補因遺精所發生一切的嚴重神經衰弱症，當余在柏林時及回國後曾藉此製劑治愈不少遺精患者，故效果的確實為全球所公認。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （俊仁）</p>
<p>十月十日，一年有一次。雙十國　，一年有一回。我們大家都知道：國是由許多社會組成的；社會是由許多家庭組成的。沒有家庭，便沒有社會。沒有社會，便不成箇國了。如此若要國慶必先社會與家庭，有可慶的地方，然後纔行。但是不幸得很，不景氣的惡症，已傳遍了各地。單就上海來說，那家商店，不在節省開支，减少人手。一天到晚，喊破喉嚨，還是沒有主顧。那條馬路旁邊，沒有幾家關門大吉的舖面。上海如此，他處可知。社會如此，家庭裏的痛苦，自然是不可避免的了！</p>
<p>自從去年十一月，政府改行法幣，下了一道命令。於是許多發行其為不成法幣的銀行，在新年過後，便大舉裁員。據人們傳說，中國實業一家，各地統計，便有三百多人。如果各家聯合統計起來，那數字是一定很可　人的。在這工商業極度衰落的年頭，如許失業的份子，到那兒去尋出路，那兒去尋職業！他們的家庭，或者有因他們失業的緣故，而投入非常可怕的深淵。唉！家庭如此，社會如此，國還有什麼慶！</p>
<h3>新疆歸客談</h3>
<p>— 正明</p>
<p>因為路途的遙遠和交通的不便，遠在邊陲的新疆，同西藏一樣，久已是一個繼的所在了。</p>
<p>最近，遇見了一位方自新疆歸來的某君，他在那兒素以行醫為業，居留甚久，所談都是耳聞目見的真實情形，我們從他的談話中便可以知道一些新疆的最近狀况了。</p>
<p>某君留居迪化最久，曾至哈密一次，其他各地也多所往返。據談新疆現頗平靜，幷無戰事發生，惟生活程度很高，而貨幣價格的猛烈增貶，更使平民生活加上了一重困難，幣制方面一般的還通用着銀兩制，去年四月間，一塊本地的大洋價值相等於一兩五錢·從米糧起直至乾草為止的一切日常生活用品，價格都是非常的昂貴。某君住的一宅小房子，初時須付租金七百兩一年，從去年起才减至三百兩了·但是房金雖是這樣的貴，因為迪化是省會居民不斷的增加上去，竟造成了餘屋不够需要的現象·這也是造成租金昂貴的一個原因·</p>
<p>歷年來僑居在新疆省內的蘇聯人民，為數極多，他們大都是以敎員，機械師，領港技師和專科敎師為業。非蘇維埃公民的俄國人已日見消沈，大有絕路於省內的可能。</p>
<p>近二三年來蘇聯僑民已建立了好幾所醫院，而在去年二月間又建造了一所蘇聯軍人醫院，某君曾在該院任事，所得的報酬頗豐，也並無岐異的待遇·新疆省內的醫藥事業至此便規模粗具了。</p>
<p>省會迪化，一切的交通建設近來很是努力，而且採用近代化，汽車數量日見增多，公共汽車已成為最適用的交通工具，從迪化到近郊各地或其他大城市，現在都有公共汽車可通，行路的困難是一天比一天的在减輕下去了。</p>
<p>警察的編制也已採取近代編制，而且組織得非常良好而嚴密，他們負維持交通與保障治安的責任，近來因邊陲風雲日緊，警察奉命須對於一班可疑的異邦人，如英國人和某國人形如間諜者，嚴密注意，同時九一八的事件的確已在新疆人民的心中留下了很大的敎訓，他們都關心國內的狀况，他們都很熱心期望祖國的復興！</p>
<h3>曾女士</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>星期一的上午我們的辦公處，來了一位新來的女職員，年紀已有三十開外，衣服更是樸質無華。但說起話來，在充滿着飽經世故的狀態。伊的這一次被僱，是在三十餘位男女投考者中，所選拔出來的真才，更兼那個位置的工作，是非常繁重的，所以同事之中，却倒例外的沒一個對伊輕視，而識為花瓶。</p>
<p>昨天，在無意中，和伊閒談，竟發現了伊的身世，是够駭人的。伊是我們口中的曾女士。伊的坦白，却真使我們同事，任何人都自愧不如。伊自己說，自己本來是一農家的女兒在七歲上，因連年的荒歉而給爸媽賣到上海來當奴婢的。因為年歲兒太小，所以對於父母的印象，已很糢糊了。主母待伊真惡劣，每天逼着伊沒命的工作，不給吃飽，也不給睡足，每天還得挨打。十七歲上，便給老爺收作了姨太太。</p>
<p>二十歲上，老爺死了，不容於主母，而狠心的主母，積着三四年來的怨毒，竟把伊賣進了一個專接洋水手的鹹水妹堂子裏去。在四年中，被鴇母帶著，走遍了汕·港·津·漢·靑·威·烟·滬各地。在十年之前，遇到了一位洋丘八，十分可憐伊，竟慷慨地給伊贖了身，而且還替伊接洽了一個女學校，命伊受敎育。一切敎育宿膳等費，都由該洋丘八負責繳付。因這洋丘八的姓氏，譯音像曾字，於是就算伊也是姓曾的。</p>
<p>伊在該校，補習了二年，進中學，又讀了六年，得了一紙高級中學的文憑。在這八年中，該洋丘八，又來華了三次，每次總給伊不少的錢，而偏巧在伊參與畢業考試時，該洋丘八病故的噩耗，忽然傳來了。伊是在前年夏間畢業的，那時，已是三十二歲了，一時找不到生活，於是到某舞塲去，充舞女。因年華老大，無人過部，於是在三個月後，投考進了某公司為售貨員。這一次，知道這裏考試一個書記，便來投考了。</p>
<p>伊說，「我是吃過苦的過來人，以後將終我生於職業界中了。」</p>
<h3>蟶期漫寫</h3>
<p>— 范學暉</p>
<p>距離我的故鄉不遠，那裏地近海岸，村民多半捕魚，矖鹽飼飬蟶子。</p>
<p>當初春時候，他們預備好了一筆錢，向外埠買來蟶苗，開始放種；大戶人家放六七担，小戶人家放二三担。</p>
<p>至初秋時，蟶子已是很肥了，那時候也是他們的蟶子收穫時期。</p>
<p>當朝霧朦朧，曉風微拂，江上充滿了乳白色，他們同了兒女到蟶田裏去拾蟶子，拾得了幾籃，就慢慢歸來了。</p>
<p>蟶子穴居汚泥中，倘使不熟此道的人，是不容易拾着的。在晨潮初退，濫泥已經茶得平滑如鏡，蟶子穴居泥裏，二脚向上，脚尖有細洞，也是它的呼吸氣管，就是從這尖端，時時有水排洩而出，因此使泥上亦有二細洞，拾蟶者，可按細洞而得。</p>
<p>這蟶子大都是供城市裏有產階級者換口味兒，我們故鄉的人，是沒有無綠無故買些吃吃的</p>
<p>那裏離城市有七十餘里之遙，有三十里是旱道，而且都是在崇山峻嶺中：所以運蟶子都是用人力的。</p>
<p>初秋午夜，我們的門前那條幽靜的街上，整夜充滿着談話聲，雖風雨之夜，這聲音亦未斷絕過。</p>
<p>挑蟶子者，大都不是販子，是自己放種，在從前他們靠着祖上遺留下來一隻破船塲，幾方蟶田，是可以溫飽地過去了；現在已經不如從前，漁村破產也到處可以看見。</p>
<h3>湖南人的特殊嗜好</h3>
<p>— （德鄰）</p>
<p>湖南人的喜歡辣味，在我們中國要算是首屈一指的了。</p>
<p>淸早起來，梳洗　漱完畢，把開水用胡椒和鹽冲成的「椒鹽湯」喝下。更有薄片的生葉，經過　醃　以後，再在太陽裏矖乾，這便是早晨和「椒鹽湯」同樣看待的　品，其餘如佐膳的辣椒，也是他們唯一的恩物。在當地普通每戶人家，平日把鮮紅的辣椒，剖閒了除掉裏面的子，用鹽醃過，裝進　子裏，以供靑黃不接時候的需要。</p>
<p>至於辣椒的吃法很多，平常菜蔬鮮肉或點心如麵食等類，他們都喜歡加進辣味，便是在宴會的酒席上，每樣的菜，都是由辣味　煮成的，並且用醬油碟子裝了不少的辣椒末。在我們江浙人看了這種的吃法，一定便要不住的咋舌。但是他們却津津有味，這是湖南人所有的特殊嗜好，湘省「民性豪爽」，大槪也是受了辣味刺激的緣故吧！</p>

<h3>唐塑紀略</h3>
<p>— （林儷琴）</p>
<p>印度佛敎，自後漢明帝時流入中國，至晋末間而大盛，迨及唐代，因廣布之宣傳；進為深入之研究，於是寺宇林立，較前代尤　。而附屬於工藝之雕塑一術，亦以佛敎昌盛之故，頓形發展，寢假而成獨特之藝術。唐人以塑像稱者，有開千元中人楊惠之，楊初與吳道子同師張僧　學繪事，巧藝並著，而道子聲光獨顯，楊憤，乃焚筆硯，改習塑像，卒以名世。其遺作見於紀　者：有安業寺廣受寺楞伽山等數處，惜皆蕩然無存。崑由　聚寺之天王像，亦楊所塑也；兩傍侍女，麗態如仙，尤為傑作。宋學士徐林嘗為文戒後人，勿許妄加修飾，後果為俗工重修，遂失初意，士林惜之！洪楊之役，　亦被燬。故惠之遺作，自洪楊以降，互七十餘年，幾於湮沒無聞。至民十一，國人顧頡剛陳萬里兩先生，因遊踪偶至，在愈　吳縣崑山之角直鎮保聖寺，發見殘缺壁塑及頹敗十八羅漢像於斷垣敗瓦間，識為惠之所作；復經日人大村西崖氏之調查研究，判定壁塑乃惠之原作，羅漢則曾加修飾，已失本來；又得葉遐庵沈柏寒諸先生維護發揚之力，賴以保存，於是千二百年前之藝術作品，不致受風吹雨打，就毀於荒榛蔓草之間，得獲昭彰於今日；斯誠藝苑大功德，其功業之不朽，固不在徐學士下也。</p>
<p>昌國寺，在吾邑丹陽縣南三十五里延陵鎮。願貌宏偉，桂宇巍然；惜年久失修，漸就頹敗。據邑乘所載：寺中十八應真，為唐人劉　所塑。考昌國寺，初　於晋太康二年；重建於唐大中之初。寺有古鐘，為開元中所鑄。以後至宋嘉祐間；明永樂嘉靖中；僅加修葺，未變舊觀，宋詞有米元章碑記，寺中應真，當猶唐人舊塑；惟劉　之名，不見史傳，恐係無名藝人，但證以重建年代，及鑄鐘之時，則塑者必係唐代人物，可無罪義。所惜僻處偏壞，未得當代賢豪之鑒賞品題，遂令千餘　之古物，湮沒不彰，僅享愚夫愚婦之禮拜而已。苟唐人舊塑之說，倘非　鼎，不將與角直唐塑，並稱於世乎！外王父東公筠靑，以家學而工南宮書法，淸季重修寺宇，正殿所懸大雄寶殿匾額，卽所書也。又邑乘中，並載神話兩則：請昌國寺十八羅漢，真身來自天台，彼此交塑而成其像，兩兩相對如生。有泥龍蟠榱桷部，當夏秋霖雨，雷電交作，嘗上與天龍門，老僧伐鼓助之；又謂羅漢中有降龍尊者，寺僧夜夢其龍語曰：今夕天龍來與吾戰，可助鼓三通。僧　悟，忽聞烈風四起；雷轟電掣，越明始安，起視泥龍，爪　淋漓；遍體萍藻。寺側陷一深池，今名蛟塘。僧懼，以木釘釘之云。齊人野語，君子不言，附錄之，聊博讀者軒渠，兼為談佐耳。</p>

<p>— 沈楨</p>
<p>登臨之勝，山不逮水，蠟屐尋幽，玻荊歷險，非腰脚濟勝者，跬步輒　，是故老弱疲窿無與焉；若夫空江風定，微波不生柔櫓一聲，月明如洗，蝶魂欲化，輕凉四浮，無假跋涉，而逸趣墴流，此張志和所以願老烟波也。然而短棹追風，合有樵靑解語，眼波月波，歌聲棹聲，消息于微塵之外，庶幾湖山彈指，　因旁通，琴操多情，鏡花亂墮，否則赤壁簫聲，終嫌索寞耳。　幾泛欋鴛湖，飽飫船娘風味，檳榔徐度，笑語珠圓，固疑此中，別燒異趣；及夫蘭溪載夢，盡態極妍，更信江山，竹坡未老。比來人事背忽，綺緒盡芟，狎客風流，徒增於邑；不意蕭齊落寞，廳遇逼人，古井重波，亂悉許買。新雨汝南君詔予曰：「子徒震江山烟雨，謂　　春，亦知淞波半幅，有　入魂夢者在乎？」乍聞矍然，起從之行，發蘆千渡，下蕰藻浜，過大橋，欵新雨六七人之門，折而東，為裕邇埠，駐岩遊　，聞隔江有膩　傳呼者，一舟刺篙而来，首一姬，臨波招客，蝉　點墨，截髪垂肩，迥眸當風，眉語欲吐，衣雪羅衫，緇褌沒蹕，圓　不衣，長身玉立，加獨鶴媚烟，中人欲醉。即舷而登，姬超躣前，殷勤訊行路，坐定四矚，舟小如　艋而略矩，其前受十人，木皮四屐，矮櫈雜陳，解衣　礴，頹然徙倚。舟尾一嫗司櫓，為幽悄，心絃潛張；於是諧謔雜肆，塵　盡脫。訊嫗名以金采香對。生小烟波，一舟雲水，略無紅塵氣。出焦以茶奉客，高壺大碗，田園本色。要之共話，漸忘形骸。姬機警逼四座，詞鋒犀利，時或率意怏談，時而　嗔不語，往往弄人於不覺，婉轉迎送處，悉中肯　，竭十人之力困之　姬泰然肆應，笑罵成章，靑紗解圖，十盪十决，而同曹　羽矣。相顧大詫，雖　兵窠甲，而豪與轉　。夜潮迅如激矢，小消江村，橫舟納東來凉　，野渡無人　姬，萬籟悉泯，微　　　，日月色愈白，照姬黛不遺祚髪，頗憶白石當年，合泥小紅低唱，因　姬歌，謝不應，强之，辗然　：「諸君豈昧唱和之道乎？我董義不在唱，而　在於和，苟有唱焉，和何　　一江夏　　最跳　，　引吭作歌，　未蘭，姬顧嗤之，以　失節，　喙如潮，　巡　　，遂爽然返欋，汐勢未平，銀蛇眩白，永安一角，　鐙如繩，突破錯霧，過大中華，馳迫　　，高　出牆，剖麵名蘸玫醬，肉鬆，裏蒸鴨，滇菜噉之，蓋舉船　突，響者皆未食也。旣而渴　，姬摘蘆粟要餇，　漿沁脾，詩腸大潤，玉京匪遙，百感又集，自疑靑瑣，使是藍橋。舟例客無前約不備鐥，先日期之，則鮮魚大肉，鷄，鴨，園蔬，唯命悉集，然飯惟脫粟，肴止肥鮮，烹飪之道，迥殊書舫，鄉村風味，適口為貴，疲於風塵者，偶　臨之，覺蕭醇之致，入骨俱淸，轉非秦淮，金　，所可同語　。</p>

<h3>歐洲花柳醫界統一的方式　集權國家對於淋病藥的最新推動</h3>
<p>— 比國Dr．Mwssolini原著日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳宗堃醫師譯</p>
<p>衛生行政機關總聯合作進一步的擴大宣傳　德國醫學界設組合部統制現有之淋病療法</p>
<p>今日的德國和意國以及蘇聯等國家，都是以開明的專制政體稱雄於全球的。他們憑着集權的政治手腕，使國內一切都紀律化。就是醫藥方面，也漸趨入整嚴的隊伍中。像花柳界的對於淋病療法的統一，便是最明顯的項目。所以國民患淋病者，都歡呼若狂。</p>
<p>意國以他的組合主義（Corporativism)的權勢通令全國衛生機關，推動最新淋病的特效藥。對於這種擴大的宣傳，目的無非在使每個男女患者都知道淋病擇藥的常識。他們同時把淋病變症的險惡，如睾丸的炎腫，關節的疫痛，婦女白帶的下部糜爛，都一一昭示民衆，進一步的呌民衆當着這些變症發生時，明白非餌服近世唯一的特效淋藥不可。這種特效淋藥就是Biede博士所發明因蛋白體和黃色素合製成的「克淋儂」。</p>
<p>因為Biede博士是德國人，又因為許多淋藥所含黃色素，質料粗劣，有敗胃損腎的流弊。所以德國的政府機關和醫學界，特設組合部（Mimisty　of　Corporation）以統制現行的淋病療法，並一一加以取締單獨提出了「克淋儂二藥。原來「克淋儂」所含黃色素，不特品質純良，並且因有着蛋白體的裨助，故而相得益彰。黃色素若不配此蛋白體，則效力不著，二者原缺一不可。我（按：Mussolnii博士自稱）曾於最近一月中，用「克淋儂」治療二百七十餘例男女患淋濁白帶者，有一百五十例於四星期內全愈，八十例於五星期內治愈。這裏面都是些慢性患者，像睾丸炎，關節炎，女性子宮炎白帶等是（女子同時外用「卡而雪地」以治白帶）。其餘急性和輕症，服此藥就更其好得快了。</p>
<h3>幾乎爛去陰莖之淋病</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業　宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>淋病不能生育之又一證</p>
<p>患者周雨吉君。年廿七歲。某次因與其夫人爭吵，忿而宿娼尋歡，遂染淋病，復失醫治，轉成慢性。周君仍不措意，任意妄行，酗酒劇勞，淋病遂亦突變；排尿本甚艱難，至此更甚。每次排尿必努脹始有少些尿液流出，且半雜膿血，經余用尿道反射鏡檢查之，則尿道周圖，皆已化膿成潰，病灶至為廣大，且腐蝕甚深，（如A　圖）大有陰莖爛去之勢，遂爭行尿道洗滌消毒之後，一方排除宿尿，免成尿中毒，同時進以「克淋儂」，以消炎防腐，殺菌鎮痛，俾病灶漸次縮小，連治至三星期後，病灶果縮小不少，而膿液亦漸滌淸，痛楚全止。再續服二星期，病灶已除，所患全愈。其尿道恢復原來狀態，毫不遺留硬結等之痕跡（如B圖），且照常排尿，房事時亦不障碍射精。但周君之疾，當初如再延　數天，則陰莖勢必爛去一節，然幸服「克淋儂」而獲保全，亦云幸矣！</p>

<h3>幾種肺結核病患治療法之最新評價</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>（診所）寗波路四山路口（诊时）下午四時至六時</p>
<p>减少肺之緊張而使病灶萎縮助成治愈之傾向　根據德法的肺病專家底理論提出具體的辦法</p>
<p>治愈肺病，的確是件不容易的事，因為以前根本就沒有特效療法。時代的輸加速的進展着肺病治療上的學理的實際處置，已經有着　人的奇蹟透露了。</p>
<p>當我在南洋醫科大學担任敎授時，在講義裏，我已把這消息宣示給一般同學，他們都莫不以　異的眼光注射到我的臉上大家異口同聲的探詢我這時對於肺病的理論與療法究竟是怎樣？記得當時我曾有過極詳細的介紹，現在因篇幅關係，不如直接轉引法國肺病學者Rindfleisch　M．D．敎授的話。據他說：『這種療法的學理，就是减少肺之緊張；因病肺自已彈力的弛緩，於是結核病灶萎縮，而空洞縮小，那些吐血，發熱，欬嗽，膿痰等症，便迎刃而解了。具有這種作用的藥物，唯有瑞士的權威學者Tome　M．D．從梅博士的「補肺拿爾」一藥。原來「補肺拿爾」能縮小病肺的空氣運動及血行淋巴行，肺臓遂得弛緩』云云。博士發明這種藥，費盡無窮的心血，結果由成千百次的動物試騐，終於發明成功。德國肺癆療養院主任醫師及副主任巴鳥魯，養谷（BaurundYuong）兩博士都認為肺病的對症良藥。美國的林朶夫來氏和英國的甘紐格爾氏等肺病專家，皆推獎此療法。林朶夫來氏曾用此藥治愈８６％的重　欬血患者，大多服此藥三星期中，就可將盜汗。潮熱，胸部刺痛等症除去，至九個星期，痰也就全然消失。用ｘ光照視，病灶早已收縮而沒有痕跡了。</p>
<p>不過須得注意的，就是肺病患者多兼有神經衰弱症，例如失眠心跳，以及男子的遺精腎萎，女子的月經不調和白帶，那就要同時進服男用「補體康」和女用「補女容」了。余長滬南平民醫院，用此項療法，於三週後即見患者體重劇增，精神飽滿，面色紅潤。故可說二十世紀最進步的療法咧。</p>
<h3>失眠和月經困難</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業　武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>兩者是何原因？　兩者有何療法？</p>
<p>怎樣失眠和月經困難放在一處呢？原來失眠的女子，她們十九都補綴衰弱的換言之，月經困難的女子，也往往會釀成失眠的疾患。她們的症狀，大槪為精神的沉　，多愁易怒，頭目眩暈，夜間惡夢多端，只消偶有一微小聲音，立即覺醒，所以往往弄到終宵不寐。因而影響到月經的不調，因為性神經受到這種失眠刺　，漸漸弄到卵巢機能乖常，所以月經便起困難了。又因為失眠和月經失調，所以營養不良而呈貧血早弱之象。</p>
<p>所以我們要醫治此病，不可不用調整卵巢機能，和强壯神經之製劑的「補女容」一藥了。此劑與梅倫氏畢生心血之結晶，牠能治愈女子一切月經不調，及神經衰弱的疾患。故對於失眠和月經困難的病，服之最為相宜。至於因月經困難而失孕的，則因月經調整後，受孕力自然恢復了。並且能使全體內分泌機能旺盛，新陳代謝機能亦亢進。故能使肌肉充實豐滿，皮　細嫩光滑，而容嬌嫩紅潤，成為一個時代的健美女子了。</p>
<h3>男性結婚困難之打破</h3>
<p>— 德國　Karlstadt博士作留俄楊道南醫師譯</p>
<p>要獲得兩性愛情之永久：　應該力求性機能之强化！</p>
<p>結婚困難，這實是現代藏有暗疾的靑年同有的悲號！的確，一個人失去了結婚的資格，內中的痛苦，確是難言的。我們從醫學上的立塲去觀察他，原來罹到不能結婚的靑年，大多數是了手淫之害，因為手淫最能損害性腺，牠能阻礙性的發育，下部萎小幾乎和小兒一樣。再他們因免不了性神經的衰弱，所以遺精，早洩，以及陰莖勃起力的不全，房事時快感的减少。這，都是失掉結婚資格的症狀。但有許多做父母的，衹知抱孫心切，不顧兒子身體是不健全，貿然為之完婚，結果弄成勞燕分飛的悲劇，</p>
<p>普天之下，這千千萬萬無量數的靑年，都沉淪於苦海，也不知道已葬送了多少有用的靑年。言之真是不寒而慄。我們應該如何去忠誠勇敢地拯救他？</p>
<p>依最近有力學者，如意大利之蘇多紐Sue-touiw（前任西班牙國立醫學院敎授），及法國優生學Talleyrand-peigard博士等一致賞用德國梅倫氏所發明之「補體康」一藥，凡是因手淫及發育未全而早婚的靑年，服役可在短短的四五星期中，把孱弱不堪的靑春腺機能予以改造，使牠發育健全，並能連帶的把由性神經衰弱而來的症狀，如遺精，漏精，心悸亢進，失眠，記憶力减低，而容憔悴，髮白額皺等早衰症狀，服「補體康」均可一掃而除，與發育不全之病同時治愈。</p>
<p>譯者按：德國因要恢復戰前的地位，他的計劃中之最重要者，就是人口增加，事先用精密方法檢查靑年的體格，竟有百分之三十强沒有結婚資格，這就是德國每年失去千萬及的小國民，但自有了「補體康」一藥問世後，人口率天天向上增多，德國之所以有今日地位，「補體康」一藥不無功勞的。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>（診所）：四川路寗波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>撲朔迷離之淋病——似淋病非淋病——而實是淋病！</p>
<p>許多淋病，往往與其他的疾患相混，如不行詳細之診察，恒不能　別果是何病，例如痔疾本是肛門部分之疾患，原與淋疾音容笑貌不相干。但許多淋病患者多不自知其病，變化，本來是稱淋病之續發症。而誤以為是痔疾。實則直腸淋每起於淋毒分泌液沾染肛門的粘膜，或由　護腺炎，精囊膿瘍。其症狀為肛門周圍發赤，流黃色膿液，後來往往有出血，糜爛，故最易傳染妻子，肛門由潰爛而狹窄，竟至不能大便，積垢愈多，淋病愈衆，所生之危險更大，若醫治不得其法，則肛門愈後，多留硬結，致失去肛門之伸縮性，而成為肛門狹窄。</p>
<p>此等症狀，病家每不注意，故多由痔病專家介紹余處治療，如住金神你路丁大川君，自稱淋病愈後，轉成痔疾。後由專家診察，始知實係淋毒性直腸炎，為之用藥洗滌後，繼用電氣療法，同時更進德國「克淋儂」，以消炎鎮痛殺菌防腐，至五星期而全瘳，大小便能暢，一如往日。至其夫人之淋毒性白帶，陰道糜爛，亦囑其外用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥，內用「克淋儂」未四星期，卽吿根治。</p>

<h3>一封公開的靑年的書信</h3>
<p>— 長沙嶽雲學校張知敏</p>
<p>固中淫書之毒為貪片刻快樂而犯手淫　自信只要堅定意志擇求療法即可根除</p>
<p>我在十三歲的時候，已有性慾觀念，睡時，總是陰莖勃起。去年下學期，來獄雲補習，預備插班。在寒假中，覺得無事可做，便翻看明宮十六朝演義，先還以為是正當的歷史小說，那知那些淫蕩的叙述，不出得不使我犯起手淫來。固然，一方面怪自己不自愛，一方面怪沒有性知識。然而當一個靑年發育到成熟期的時候，得不到異性的安慰，那得不藉此發洩呢？</p>
<p>可憐的我，今年才十五歲呀。</p>
<p>我染上手淫惡習，起初尙不覺得怎樣，於是一而再，再而三，三而四……後來就感覺到衰弱的，雖誓自戒除，然已發生許多疾病。哎！手淫如何等的危險啊！症狀：先患夢遺。隨之而起的，是暈眩，耳鳴。頭重頭痛，而部潮乾燥，而黃肌瘦，腰腿痛疫。雖洗冷水浴，仍是無效。且現遺精病更重，卽白書亦遺，夜間甚者一二次，精神益弱。</p>
<p>有許多人疑我是肺病，但我有時身體很是爽快，像沒有病一樣。可是我的意志已非常薄弱，作事有始無終，記憶力大减。苦痛，煩惱，包圍了我整個的身心。</p>
<p>我為什麼不悲觀呢？因我想：全國患手淫的人，有百分之九十以上，尤其是靑年人最多。就是我校患手淫者也有　分之九。我雖曾有過自殺的　頭，但是，我的雙親年均在予百以上，養育我到這麼大，　死了，如何對得他們住呢？　况現在科學發達，許多疾病都有着根本的治療，只要自己堅定志向，難道患手淫的人就沒有光明的前程麼？恐怕世界的名人中，總有幾個患手淫的吧！</p>
<p>鍾麟先生：久仰你的大名請你指示自療的途徑，救一個人！</p>
<p>知敏先生：你的疾病，我們近幾年來治愈與你相同病，以服近世最馳名的德國Neal's氏所發明的「耐而斯遺精片」是最有功效的。因為他能堅定神志，收攝輸精管和精囊的弛緩。但你的病，性神經也十分衰弱了，所以一方還須同時服「補體康」以治愈因遺精而引起的一切神經衰弱症。再你手淫的惡習也定須戒絕，這確是最進步的自療方法。（武鍾麟醫師答）</p>

<p>手淫與矮肥　編輯先生：我是一個二十歲的女子，因幼患手淫，今雖戒絕，但病狀已呈：思想遲鈍，身體矮肥。惟遺精有沒有我却不曉得。我家敎甚嚴，來往書信，必受家長檢騐，請你就在報上答復吧！（本埠徐玉美女士）</p>
<p>（答）你的病是因手淫而致卵巢機能障碍所致，故有矮肥遲笨等現象，不治將來結婚後，便不能生育。應餌服『補女容』以糾正卵巢，卽可獲得俏麗的時代美。又：遺精是男性的病症，女子沒有。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>外交公開</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>外交一事，本來帶一些神秘性的，因為神秘，於是有討價還價，或伸縮的餘地，外交易於辦理，若一經公開，則雙方轉身，便覺困難，其實神秘有神秘的好處，也有神秘的壞處，倘弱國與强國外交，愈神秘對於弱國愈覺不利，因强的一方，明知雙方秘密進行，並不外洩，儘可望天討價，為所欲為。</p>
<p>若外交一經公開，彼所提出的條件為何？我們所還的價錢為何？使全國人共知之，使世界各國共聞之，則强者一方，或顧到國情的勝沸，或慮若各國的責言，則共所提條件或可稍加審愼，稍加顧慮，不致獅子大開口，幷且一經秘密，國內旣莫測其究竟而愈形緊張，各國亦因利害的相關，而共相猜測。</p>
<p>卽如前日路透電，發表關於日本對華提出之要求條件四項，日政府完全吾認，謂該社所傳四項要求說，係別有用意，則閱報者必定有些疑惑，而莫名其三官堂！然則所謂四條件者，果眞有其事歟？無其事歟？若無其事，則日方所提出者為何種條件歟？此均令人迷離恍惚，而莫能明瞭者也。</p>
<p>總之日方歷來之外交，均以秘密為手腕，愈秘密則於彼愈利，日方明知華人為體面，事實儘可吃虧，而面子不喪毫末，故多用此行險僥倖的手叚，我方亦以國內多故，安內未遑，何言對外，亦惟有得過且過，一方作積極的準備，一方未到最低限度之時，决不作最大犧牲之抵抗，此原出於當局萬不得已的苦心。</p>
<p>現在日方派川越到京，淤中日之間，欲作整個的談判，且欲强請蔣院長回京，殊失國際間交涉的慣例，故字林西報著論，謂日方堅持須由政府領袖談判，絕無理由，此眞可謂最後之一刹那矣，總之現在的中日交涉，已至最後的分歧點，故此决交涉，自應根本解决，以省却枝枝節節的麻煩，故此决交涉，應不僅打消所提出的條件而止，而歷來日方在華的一切侵略或破壞痕跡，均應予以撤消。</p>
<p>現在我國朝野，對於此决外交，眞如日人所謂已超過能忍耐的限度，全國上下，萬目睽睽，密切注視此次交涉的結果，而願作最後的犧牲，國存國亡，在此一舉，我們自當本着沉靜的態度，抱定最後的决心，無論交涉至若何困難地步，我們惟有於不喪主權，不失尺土八字的原則下，可與談判，否則惟有盡其力之在我者而已。</p>
<h3>進城</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>－山行雜記</p>
<p>－先生，進城以後，那司機的停了一下，好像不敢說的樣子，是落棧還是……？</p>
<p>這是不能怪他的，陌生的行旅帶了陌生的貨件，跑進山國的陌生的縣城，投給我們的，自然都是陌生的嘴臉，而且，這正在夜靜更深的時候吶！這，也許引起了他的懷疑，也許他會止不住的在想：－落棧，怕都不容易呢！省里查得緊，夜半別人家是不肯隨便開門的。</p>
<p>阿黃笑了笑，輕輕地答了句：「還沒有一定！」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>大家把頭靠在生硬的車壁上，讓長木凳子磨得屁股有點發燒，各人做着各人的好夢，對於阿黃對司機的對答，根本就沒有人注意。車廂里怪靜的，不恊和的鼾聲，打成了一團。</p>
<p>現在道路平起來了，不像以前那樣的顛簸了，路面是舖着黃沙。</p>
<p>—那末，進那個門呢？司機的又開口了。</p>
<p>—近一點的，就威西門吧！</p>
<p>路旁，開始看見了低小的房屋，燈光却不見，沉沉地，房門外偶爾的也看見了倦睡的身軀，這時，車子的聲音把他們驚醒了，他們似乎沒有意料到會再有車子的夜行！</p>
<p>從燈光的照耀里，從喇叭的吼呌里，使我們看見了前面的城樓。城樓，並不怎樣的高大，城垜彷役鋸齒，在月色下，伸長，埋在圖的包團里，墙底下，除了些野草以外，只是看不出的漆黑一片。</p>
<p>—到嘍。老鐵的花臉嗓子着實驚人，靠了車壁的腦袋一個個的都直立起來，接着，他格格地笑了，還拍着手。</p>
<p>那時司機的人一定存了奇怪的念頭：「進城，怕不是那麼容易吧？就只盤查或許就要費去相當的時間，結果給你個不准進城，也說不定。」對於他的奇異的表情，我們都沒有理會，事實上我們沒有告訴他聽的義務。假使能告訴他我們的來歷，那疑慮的眼睛一定會釋然的。</p>
<p>—他們要盤查呢？黃先生。不能忍耐的，他又說話了。</p>
<p>—曉得，祇管開就是！</p>
<p>車子，距城門四丈遠的地方停下了，門緊關着，城樓上幾個守衛的士兵，荷了槍，看不清什麼嘴臉，電筒的光燄交射到車子上，大聲呌着：</p>
<p>—那里來的車子？上面什麼人？進城到那里去？……</p>
<p>車子上沒有給他什麼回答，只是將從前的旗子由窗洞挑出去，旗子不小，上面縫了斗大的字。</p>
<p>士兵不再說什麼，請求我們從南面的門洞進去，那里，等候了迎接的友人。沿了環城的那條馬路，吼呌着，吼呌着，走上省垣的市街。城里的市面倒底不能與城外比擬的，街頭，呌不出路名的街頭，還有煤氣燈在燃燒着，青亮的光芒噬着整個店里的貨色，伙計，瞪直了眼睛好像看熱鬧樣的趕出來相互詢問着，怎麼會有「夜車」？這夜車又是那位人物的　備？但，誰都　　出，　給他們的僅是　空猜測。</p>
<p>把貨物箱籃卸到公館的時候，鐘，指在子夜的兩點上。</p>
<p>躺到床上，簡直的睡不着，想到九盤子的險境，想到爬抓溪的路徑，想到狼虎的突襲，想到趕塲的小商人的被搶，…川流的一切喲！</p>
<h3>桂花糖</h3>
<p>— 梅平</p>
<p>大姊從鄉下寄來一包桂花糖，附信里說：沒有在家里過中秋已經八年了，今年又瞧見桂樹開花，覺得特別可愛，於是尋出我們人前製糖的印版來，和你的外甥女兒爬樹，揀花，媽帮着買橄檯，烏梅，杏仁等東西，足足忙了三天功夫，才製就這些糖。可是三個孩子在敲糖的時候就吃起，以後又偷着吃，寄上的一些是從外甥嘴裏留下來的，你也應該留給你的孩子們吃罷。</p>
<p>是的，吃桂花糖的時候已經過去了。</p>
<p>大姊出閣已八年，生了三個孩子，但是一個險惡的風浪吞噬了她的丈夫，她就重回到家里來了。她說八年沒有在家過中秋是真實的，又瞧見桂樹開花而覺得特別可愛也是真實的，可是她沒有向我吐露我們的青春已經過去了，我們更遭遇着惡魔一樣的命運，留給我們的孩兒吃的希望，太是一個遙遠的幻想吧！</p>
<p>我把桂花糖藏了起來，我應該珍惜八年來被遺棄了的桂樹，應該珍惜大姊製糖時的情緒；更應該珍惜母親上街買橄欖等東西的興趣。母親的希望還是在大姊和我的身上的，留給孩子們吃的路程是太長了！</p>
<p>看着那色翠綠的橄欖仁的，墨赭的烏梅的，玉白的杏仁的桂花糖，我真想馬上回到家里去和媽大姊同住着，不，現在還有三個外甥。或許桂花也沒有凋殘吧。</p>
<p>兩株桂樹就在我的臥室前面的院子里，都是金桂。中秋節前後，樹上開滿了花朶，一叢叢的掩映在綠葉之間，一陣陣的幽香隨風送來，我和大姊在臥室里洗着製糖牌版，又偷偷上街去買一點烏梅，那時候母親是不許我們攀折桂花的，她說桂花的盛衰是關係家庭的興亡的，到桂樹開花的時節，她總是忙着告訴人家：「今年又開了滿樹的花呢！」說話時拉開了嘴，表示她心中的高興。</p>
<p>親戚，鄰舍，常常川流不息地來討花，母親先要問清楚了他們的用處。說是製糖的她一律拒絕：「那是罪過的！等它落花的時候，我用單被兜了送來。」如果告訴她中秋晚上供瓶齊天，她才允許；可是也不能攀折大枝的。</p>
<p>我們等不及落花的時候製糖，倒並不是因為落花時香味已經散盡了，花朶也變成難看的僵黃色，實在她太誘惑孩子們的好動的心理。我們常常偷着攀折了一枝花，和大姊關在臥室里謹慎地選揀細　，用鹽水洗凈，把糖和烏梅放在磁盆里輕輕地搗着，二個人流着滿頭汗，費去大半天，往往製得了十幾顆糖。但是我們是快活的，一次一次藏起來。等到落花時候，母親用單被兜着了花允許我們製糖，我們已經藏了許多了，可惜都是烏梅的，因為烏梅價錢最便宜，我不敢向母親要錢去買橄欖和杏仁，恐怕她發現我們私下製糖。</p>
<p>於是母親裝做發怒的樣子鬧着：</p>
<p>「不好了！家里養着兩個偷花賊呢！」</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「好！你們瞞着我做得好事！罪過！罪過！」一會兒又：「快些不要響，被他們（指親戚鄰舍）知道了說我小氣。」</p>
<p>但是母親是快活的。她一家一家去分了花回來，買了橄欖和杏仁，大規模地製桂花糖了，一做總是上幾千顆。</p>
<p>這八年來大姊出閣了，我被生活磨折着流落在大都市里，桂樹雖然八度開花，凋落，但是我可以斷定除了中秋節親戚和鄰舍攀折幾枝去供瓶齊天，家里已經沒有人高興採它來製糖，母親也沒有情緒在落花時節用單被兜了花朶按家去分送。</p>
<p>這遙遠的八年，大姊已生了三個孩子，我也是一個孩子的父親了。母親却重鼓起興趣上街去買橄欖，烏梅，杏仁等東西，大姊像小時候一樣爬上樹去攀折花枝，在這次大規模製糖的時候，我想母親一定更懷念着她的兒子沒有回來參加八年來未有之盛會。</p>
<p>看着那包翠綠的橄欖仁的，墨赭的烏梅的，玉白的杏仁的桂花糖，我真不忍放到我孩子的嘴里去，一霎時化為烏有。這桂花糖有着一段悲痛的故事，這桂花糖關係着我們家庭的興亡。</p>
<p>我寫信給大姊，告訴她我像小時候一樣把那包糖珍藏了；並且想多知道了一點製糖人的近况。</p>
<h3>在先生大便的時候</h3>
<p>— 茅思</p>
<p>「孤……古……你們孤兒的孤字……古……呵呵……」古字唸了一半，呵欠已從腸子里迫到了喉底，應該合起嘴唇念古字的嘴，却張得喇叭口那樣的，露出二排黑縫的牙齒。二條　伸過了頭。眼淚給眼角的眼屎帶住了。清水鼻涕却毫無阻礙地從鼻孔下一條溝直流到嘴里。</p>
<p>然在貼着一張「小六字」字條約書桌邊的瞎了一隻眼睛的孩子，他從書縫中看到先生的臉孔，哈的笑出聲來。先生把手里拿着的一根竹棒，在桌子上重重地一碰：「誰在那里笑」！</p>
<p>教室里便什麼聲音都沒有了。</p>
<p>先生拿着竹棒古呀古的，古了不滿三分鐘，就放下孤兒讀本，用竹棒碰了二下桌子：「先生去大便，你們自己好好兒溫習一下！」</p>
<p>孤兒們的頭串在一起的地擺動着，聲音串在一起的地唱着書。先生認為滿意。放下他的竹棒，曲着背出教室去了</p>
<p>看見先生的蘆柴棒似的背影已經消失。小六子第一個從凳子上跳上書桌，大家也跟着他跳上凳子，書桌，窗檻。小六子像司令官那麼的向大家說：「先生幹嗎去的？你們知道嗎？」</p>
<p>大家伸起一隻手，把當中的三個指頭彎下，大拇指與小指翹起着，大姆指含在嘴唇里。合夥兒唱：「拉拉拉，扯扯扯，先生抽鴉片，活猻出巴戲！」唱罷，大家猴子那麼的在書桌上跳着。</p>
<p>「喂！你們看見過鴉片烟槍沒有」？阿根跳到小六子旁邊，得意地說着，樣子好像要奪小六子的權威。</p>
<p>「沒有……我們沒有看見過」。</p>
<p>阿根拿起先生時常打他們頭的竹棒，「烟槍跟這棒差不多，不過，上面還有一個……黑芋芀頭」。他又把先生的教本揉做一團，「這是一盞小玻璃燈」！然後，他到桌子上，把竹棒的一頭含在嘴里，一頭對着揉得圓圓的書，「扯扯扯」！扯了一回，從嘴里吐出一口熱氣。</p>
<p>小六子把一件蓆紋布短衫裏住了頭，拿墨在臉上搽了鬍髭，「茄得利，買得利，到行裏去！」說着，對在書桌上的阿根一脚。阿根從書桌上跌下來，他的瘌痢頭跌出了血。他哭了，他罵小六子「小忘八」，冷不妨，阿根從地上一骨環爬起來，朝小六子頭上就是一棒。小六子的光光的和尚頭上立刻起了一個紅紅的。於是二個便扭作一團。</p>
<p>站在旁邊的，全都拍着手，着脚喊好！</p>
<p>「誰在那里打架啊」！</p>
<p>大家聽到這聲音，各自坐到自己的位子上去了，小六子和阿根也放開手，回到位子上。先生拿着一把小茶壺精神抖擻的踏着八字步威嚴地進來。他首先看見阿根頭上的血，他就高聲兒問：「阿根！剛才是你在打架嗎」？一股焦味兒從黑牙縫里吐出來。</p>
<p>「是小六子打我……頭上……血……血，」阿根哭了。</p>
<p>「先生，阿根說先生吃……」</p>
<p>「什麼，你們二個都不是好東西……立壁角！」先生提起小茶壺呷了一口，　一　嘴：「下次再這樣，送你們到警察局去！」</p>
<p>小六子和阿根哭着朝墻壁立着。其餘的，頭串在一起的地罷動着，聲音串在一起的地唱書。</p>

<p>托爾斯泰說過：「維繫宇宙者，愛力而已！」而愛中最有力的一種，則是莫過於母親的愛，天性的，無邪的，真實的，偉大的。</p>
<p>「母愛」這一部影片，也是由於這種意念形成的，這一個劇本的產生，遠在兩三年前，經過劇作者多次的修改，才成功了完美的「母愛」劇本。</p>
<p>人類的私慾，常常造成不可挽救的罪惡，這個故事裏的父親，便是由於私慾而造成罪惡的一個，但「真誠之愛，可解切齒之仇，」所以這個罪人，終於被偉大的母愛解救出來。</p>
<p>固然，世間也有少數的母親，猶其是棄婦，她們缺少對兒女的愛心，但普遍的現象，則是與此完全相反的，所以「母愛」只是從多數上着眼，而那些少數的，也可以說是自己的私慾造成無窮的黑惡。</p>
<p>這裏的母親，她拋開了女人應該享受的一切，而來維護愛子無限的前程，她不肯為了　惡劣的遭遇，而使清白無辜的孩子也陷於惡劣的環境中，她這種偉大的犧牲精神，終於獲得了最後勝利。</p>
<p>道高一尺，魔高一丈，在人類私慾所造成萬惡社會中，無時不有這種極高的魔力在活動，而魔力所認為最大的敵人，則是有正氣的人，「母愛」裏的小芬，在成年後，便不不為魔力所屈服的人，但他在萬分危險中，幾乎送掉了性命。</p>
<p>犧牲性命，并不是挽救罪惡的善策，比如「母愛」裏的父母，雖然犧牲他的性命，但并不足以洗刷他所造成的罪惡，不過他是在沒有第二條辦法當中，只好出此下策了。</p>
<p>母親的不正當發展，便是溺愛，溺愛往往會陷害了弱小的錄魂，得到相當反的效果，「母愛」對這一點是更特別提出了的。</p>
<p>近朱者赤，近墨者黑，假設我們不是見古卽反的話，比如孟母三遷這一類舉動，正不是無謂的行為，母敎不同師敎，母敎是無形有力而又無微不至的，母敎是不　要甚麼代價，幾乎是存於俯仰呼吸之間的，這裏面於母敎的問題，也有更高的理解。</p>
<p>因為人類有了私慾，才會產生外力的誘惑，卽使私慾得到暫時的解决，都往往會產生無限的後悔，假如是不但有了私慾，而私慾有了正當的解决時，更是追悔不及的錯過，「母愛」的父親一角，就是這類人物的代表。</p>
<p>至於影片本身的導演，演員，懾影，佈景，收音，各方面，則是觀眾可以直接得到圓滿的解答，而無須這裏贅述了的。</p>

<h3>Key to Solving Sino-Japanese Problems Lies with Japan; Government's Policy is to Follow Public Opinion; Northwestern Generals Absolutely Obey Central Government Orders; Zhang Xueliang Talks with British Reporter</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Mrs. Haisttor, a reporter from the London Daily Herald, visited Zhang Xueliang, the Acting Commander-in-Chief, in Xi'an a few days ago. Zhang met with her at his private residence in Jinjia Lane at 6 p.m. on the third, with a reporter from the Central News Agency present. Mrs. Haisttor asked the questions and Zhang acted as the translator. In his answers, Zhang solemnly stated three points: (1) Reports in foreign newspapers about the independence of the four northwestern provinces and alliance with Russia are pure rumors. (2) He and the northwestern generals absolutely support the leader, support unification, and stand united against foreign aggression. (3) He and the northwestern generals absolutely obey the central government's orders and are willing to serve on the front lines of national defense. The following is a record of the conversation: (Mrs. Haisttor asked) What is your opinion on the Sino-Japanese problem? (Zhang Xueliang answered) In my personal opinion, the Chinese government has been striving for peace at all times, both before and after the September 18th Incident, and even to the point that the general public does not understand. Therefore, the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem lies entirely with Japan, not with China. (Asked) What is your opinion on Sino-Japanese diplomacy? (Answered) I have not been to Nanjing recently, so I am not very familiar with the diplomatic situation. However, in my personal opinion, if Japan can understand the dangers between the two countries and make the negotiations proceed smoothly, then the Chinese government should, on the one hand, base its policy on consistent peace to strive for the adjustment of diplomatic relations, and on the other hand, make the public understand in order to achieve peace. In short, whether or not diplomatic relations can be adjusted, the responsibility lies entirely with Japan. If the conditions proposed by Japan are unacceptable to China, even if the government tolerates them, the public will be difficult to accept. For example, the Twenty-One Demands were once accepted by the Beijing government at the time, but the public has never recognized them. (Asked) Now that Sino-Japanese relations are becoming increasingly tense, how will the Chinese government respond? (Answered) This is difficult to answer definitively, but in my personal opinion, the government will surely follow public opinion, as the government's foundation is built on public opinion. (Asked) What is your opinion on Chinese unification and the cessation of civil war (including bandit suppression)? (Answered) Unification is the will of the people. The peaceful resolution of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi this time was purely to follow public opinion. China, in the face of foreign aggression, will definitely be unified. Recalling the frequent internal turmoil before the September 18th Incident, which was then followed by unity, this shows the result of the public's strong desire for unification. As for bandit suppression, it cannot be compared to civil war. Sending troops to encircle and suppress bandits is to promote the early resolution of banditry and the early stabilization of order. (Asked) Now, the general Chinese youth hope to stop bandit suppression. What does Acting Commander-in-Chief think? (Answered) This is just an emotion. Emotion is one thing, obeying orders is another. They must not be confused. However, if the Red Bandits can realize their mistakes, reform, and surrender, obey the orders of the central government, and complete the work of unification as soon as possible, reducing one point of energy loss will increase one point of national strength. Of course, this is also deeply hoped for. (Asked) What is your opinion on the North China economic cooperation that is already underway? (Answered) I am not familiar with the content, so it is difficult to answer. (Asked) What is your opinion on the Chinese student movement and freedom of speech and assembly? (Answered) If it is reasonable and legal, freedom should of course be permitted. But if there is a need for restriction due to exceeding the boundaries, the government also has its difficulties. The conversation ended here, lasting a total of thirty-five minutes. Mrs. Haisttor and the reporters then exited. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Lu Chao gave a congratulatory speech, followed by Ma Chaojun, who hoped that Catholic friends would cooperate with the citizens of Beijing to develop Catholic affairs. Then, Weng Wenhao, Yan Binhang, and others gave congratulatory speeches. Weng said that Yu's hosting of Catholic affairs in the Beijing area as a Northeasterner made us deeply mindful of territorial relations. Finally, Yu gave a thank-you speech, saying that the Pope's spirit is to make the world public, and he hopes that priests across the country will work hard for the country. He himself is willing to follow the Pope's will and work on the front lines of society, and wants to be a good citizen, a good national, and a good bishop, expressing the spirit of the Gospel in practical undertakings. However, his heart is long but his strength is weak, and he hopes that people in society will cooperate and assist him. The photography session ended around 2 p.m. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office of the Central China Games Receives Press; Directors of Education from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei Will Not Go to Hunan</h3>
<p>(Changsha) The Preparatory Office of the 6th Central China Games received the press on the fourth. Fang Kegang reported on the progress of the preparations, hoping that the newspapers would do their best to publicize the promotion of national sports and promote national revival. The following is a summary of the news about the Central China Games: The directors of education from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces, Yang Lian, Cheng Shizhen, Cheng Qibao, telegraphed the conference, stating that they would not be able to participate in the Central China Games in Hunan due to important official duties in their provinces. Female middle school students throughout the city held a National Arts performance at the Education Association on the fourth, directed by Li Lijiu.

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Comments on the Shanghai-Beijing Press Declaration—Expresses Willingness to Accept—Canton-Hankou Colleagues Also Have Corresponding Articles</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Daily News and the Asahi Shimbun both published the outline of the article "Our Common Opinions and Beliefs in the Sino-Japanese Relations Tension" jointly issued by twenty-one newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai on the morning of the third, in their evening editions on the same day. The Jiji Shinpō also published it on the morning of the fourth. Most newspapers were silent on the article, but the Jiji Shinpō published an article today commenting that the recent attitude taken by the Japanese press was not to strengthen the Japanese diplomatic front, nor was it to be driven by warmongering soldiers, but to express the Japanese people's anger at the anti-Japanese terror and the lack of sincerity of the Chinese government. However, given the unprecedented seriousness of the current situation, most of the appeals made by the Chinese press to Japanese public opinion were the result of a deep understanding of the true situation. We appreciate the patriotic declaration made by our colleagues and accept what they say in good faith. The Chinese press's warning to the people to curb blind retaliatory activities is indeed of great value. We hope that this attitude can be maintained unswervingly. The Chinese press's advice to the people to unite and support the government seems sufficient to make the Chinese government abandon superficial theories and work hand in hand with Japan. The statement in the declaration such as "Leading 400 million people to defend the country and die for the country in the last moment" is indeed a great awakening. This seems to be a serious determination by the Chinese people to the Japanese government and people. Some Japanese people also believe that anti-Japanese riots were caused by elements against the National Government. However, Japan should hold the National Government responsible for its failure to suppress such elements, so hoping that Japan will take a moderate attitude on this point is tantamount to delegating the responsibility of the National Government, or admitting that it is unable to maintain law and order. The newspaper concluded that the wishes to the Japanese government and people that the Chinese press had repeatedly mentioned was to mobilize all its strength to persuade President Chiang and the National Government to resolutely reconcile with Japan. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The article "Our Common Opinions and Beliefs in the Sino-Japanese Relations Tension" jointly published by the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai on the second is sufficient to represent the true meaning of our country's press. Colleagues everywhere expressed their deep sympathy. The Hankou reporters' corps from the newspapers of Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin sent a telegram of support. Regarding the responsibility for the murder of Yoshioka that occurred in the Japanese concession in Hankou, the corps made a factual statement based on the interviews it conducted after the incident, stating that the location where the Yoshioka incident occurred was within the Japanese concession police area, which could not be reached by our country's political forces. Moreover, the truth of the Chengdu and Shanghai incidents is still unclear, but friendly countries have suddenly shown their excessive tension, making Sino-Japanese relations increasingly dangerous. It is hoped that Japanese people will appreciate the meaning of mutual assistance between the two major ethnic groups in East Asia and work hard to maintain peace in East Asia. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou press held a meeting on the evening of the fourth to discuss donating aircraft to celebrate President Chiang's birthday and resolved to publish a joint article on the Sino-Japanese issue, responding to the opinions jointly published by the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai on the second.

<h3>A Glimpse of Situational Observations Before Kuwashima's Arrival in China; Kuwashima is a Stable Faction in the Japanese Diplomatic World; Japanese Army's Opinion Does Not Favor Rupture</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain military source in Tianjin, Kuwashima, the director of the East Asia Bureau, is a stable faction in the Japanese diplomatic world who has always held a gradualist approach to China and advocated peace. This time, he was sent to China to convey orders to Kawagoe, and Sino-Japanese relations will improve due to Kuwashima's arrival. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reliable information, after Kuwashima arrives in China, he will not only convey the intentions of the three provinces to Kawagoe, but will also assist in the negotiations. Although the Japanese actions in Shanghai tend to be tense, the actual intention is to achieve results. The army supported by the Kwantung and North China military departments does not favor rupture. Only the navy side wants to show its merits and is slightly more active, but it does not harbor the intention of starting a war. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beijing Municipal Government to Impose Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The municipal government will start imposing land price tax on the first of next month, starting with the first and second districts. The land registration and valuation charts have been submitted by the Land Administration Bureau. If there are public ponds within the land, how will the land tax be calculated and collected? The municipal government has approved that the value of the ponds should be calculated at half the land price in accordance with common practice, so the pond land will be taxed at half the land price. The land registration in the rural area will be surveyed after the urban area is completed. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beijing City to Prepare for the Establishment of a National Goods Market</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Branch of the National Economic Construction and Transportation Association has prepared a plan to establish a national goods market for production and sales cooperation in Beijing. According to the plan, the funds required are allowed to issue public bonds of 1.5 million to 2 million in the name of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce promoting national goods and economic construction. One million will be used to build the market, and 500,000 to 1 million will be used to organize a commercial bank to rescue national goods industries. The plan has been reviewed and confirmed, and preparations will begin immediately. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking in Adult Women; Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan have Completed Review; Advocate that Our Country Should Approve Accession</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The international Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking in Adult Women was issued by the National Government to the Legislative Yuan, and the Foreign Affairs and Criminal Law Committees of the Yuan have invited representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Interior to a meeting to complete the review. Article 10 of the Convention stipulates that colonial territories, protectorates, overseas territories, or dependent territories, and mandated territories are not bound by the obligations under this Convention unless each signatory country makes a special declaration. Since the trafficking of women in our country is mostly in the above-mentioned areas and is most cruel, it would be a stain on justice and humanity if the provisions of this Convention were not applied to them. Although this opinion was submitted by our government's delegation to the League of Nations when discussing this case, it was regrettably not passed. However, as a result of the review, everyone agreed that the suppression of trafficking in women ultimately relies on international cooperation, so it is advocated that our country should still approve accession to this Convention, which has been submitted to the Yuan for deliberation. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Pays Attention to Business Statistics</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believed that there were no fixed rules for railway business statistics, so it drafted the Railway Business Statistics Rules and convened personnel in charge of business statistics from the traffic and accounting departments of seven railways, including Pinghan, Beining, Jinpu, Longhai, Jiaoji, Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Pingsui, to hold a meeting at the ministry to discuss. The second draft of the Railway Business Statistics Rules was drafted and submitted to the competent departments for review, to formulate a formal draft, and then submit it to the statistics meeting for decision.

<h3>A Visit to "Sanjiang Hao"</h3>
<p>— Qu Yuan</p>
<p>"This is 'Sanjiang Hao' – Mr. Luo, the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Volunteer Army." A friend introduced me to a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>"I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I thought you weren't coming." He was amiable and peaceful, and one couldn't tell that he was the "Sanjiang Hao" who commanded respect in the Northeast.</p>
<p>A south-facing room, dark and damp, with simple furnishings, this was his home. There were his parents-in-law (surnamed Meng, originally from Jilin, who were forced to enter the Pass last year), his wife, nephew, and other family members, six in all. Hearing the Northeastern accent, everyone was very warm.</p>
<p>"Sanjiang Hao's" real surname is Luo, and his given name is Mingxing. Since the September 18th Incident, he and his brothers have traveled all over the Heilongjiang, Songhua River, and Yalu River areas. They are not afraid of death and do not disturb the people, so they are welcomed everywhere, and they gave him the nickname "Sanjiang Hao."</p>
<p>He is of medium height, bald, fair-skinned, thin, and thirty-nine years old. His tone is low, he speaks slowly, and he looks like a businessman.</p>
<p>"When did you come from the Northeast?"</p>
<p>"It was December 18th last year. I came back to see the situation. If our compatriots and the government are really willing to work together, we will continue to fight. Otherwise, I have to make other plans. I can't just do nothing, but I can't be reckless!"</p>
<p>At this time, Luo – "Sanjiang Hao's" mother-in-law came up to me, asking about this and that, chattering endlessly: "I haven't seen anyone from outside the Pass for a long time. When did you enter the Pass?" I said, "It was just when the green crops were rising last year. It's so fast, a whole year has passed in the blink of an eye."</p>
<p>"Do you miss home?" Luo's wife was also exceptionally kind.</p>
<p>"When you're running around outside, how can you have time to miss home? But being here today feels like being back in my hometown. Every time I think of the friends in the Northeast suffering, my heart aches. Ah! I haven't had any communication for a year." As I spoke, I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went out to eat, partly to give him a farewell dinner. Luo was extremely afraid of extravagance:</p>
<p>"Just eat something simple. There are many who are hungry! Friends don't care about this, right? I can handle any kind of life. In the Northeast, I didn't eat or sleep for days, but I felt good. Being at home for a few days, I feel depressed." He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, just eats the dishes slowly.</p>
<p>During the meal, we talked about the situation since the September 18th Incident:</p>
<p>"In the past four or five years, there have been no less than five or six hundred battles. Sometimes there are one or two small conflicts every day. We killed a lot of enemies, but we also lost a lot of brothers. You may have heard about it outside the Pass, right?"</p>
<p>"I've known your nickname for a long time. I still remember that incident at Yantong Mountain. It was really fierce. There was a folk song circulating at the time, but I can't remember it very well now."</p>
<p>Wang put down his wine glass and thought for a moment, then said: "Let me recite a section for you. It's completely in the dialect of the Northeastern folks. Okay, listen:</p>
<p>"...</p>
<p>We are all poor and bare,</p>
<p>Living is suffering, what's so hard about dying?</p>
<p>Those with power can sell the country,</p>
<p>Those with connections can be traitors,</p>
<p>We have no power and no connections,</p>
<p>Where can we be safe?</p>
<p>We can only fight,</p>
<p>We can only get back our country!</p>
<p>Everyone listened with tears rolling down,</p>
<p>Everyone lowered their heads in silence.</p>
<p>The team went into the mountains,</p>
<p>The leader suddenly changed his face,</p>
<p>Heavy snow kept falling,</p>
<p>It snowed for several days.</p>
<p>Everyone couldn't walk,</p>
<p>Everyone was shivering.</p>
<p>They all said they came to save the country;</p>
<p>It seems that saving the country is pitiful!</p>
<p>Just when I was feeling miserable,</p>
<p>Suddenly, cannons roared,</p>
<p>Shaking my spirits, I rushed forward,</p>
<p>Gritting my teeth, I attacked happily!</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>"After experiencing these fires, have you been injured?"</p>
<p>He smiled and quietly rolled up his trouser leg to show us. Ah! Scars, one after another, were etched on his knees, ankles, insteps, and calves. There were also white and purple round holes on his hands, all caused by gunfire. Deep scabies crawled between his wrists, said to be the result of fighting in the water for three days. At this time, I couldn't help but feel excited and ashamed. I respectfully offered him a cup of wine, which he reluctantly drank.</p>
<p>At night, everyone didn't sleep, just talked: from Luo (Sanjiang Hao)'s personal life to the Volunteer Army, from the beginning of the activity to the present. Everything was very complicated, but he could explain it clearly. At the same time, he also revealed these words:</p>
<p>"The Volunteer Army's armband says, 'Not afraid of death, not disturbing the people.' No matter how rude and brutal the brothers are, as long as they follow these six words, we can survive and win.</p>
<p>"We never believe that China will be destroyed by others. We always believe that even if there is only one person left, we must resist!</p>
<p>"Of course, we can't think too highly of ourselves, but we can't underestimate ourselves either. Isn't the matter clear? China suffered because it wasn't united. Later, when everyone was united, we showed our face.</p>
<p>"Saving the country is our own business. How can we rely on others? Destroying China and saving China are both done by Chinese people.</p>
<p>"Being in the Volunteer Army is my life, my job. No danger or difficulty can stop me. I clearly see that danger and hardship are what I should endure, and what I am doing is precisely a dangerous and difficult undertaking.</p>
<p>"Now that I've done it, I'll do it until the end, regardless of success or failure.</p>
<p>"Whoever has the ability and can save the country, I will follow him. Whoever is willing to save the country, whoever sympathizes with me, will come with me. Saving the country is not one person's business. Whether you are a scholar or a soldier, isn't it for saving the country? Come! Let's work together!"</p>
<p>We also talked about the situation of the "People's Revolutionary Army." Finally, I asked him when he would return to the Northeast.</p>
<p>"Let my elder brother (Meng Zhaoqing, Luo's brother-in-law, who is the commander of the enemy) go down first. I'll go after I get some information. It won't be long. Now, my body is in the country, but my heart is in the Northeast. The sooner I leave, the sooner I can rest easy. In the future, I want to put more effort into work reports. In the past, we only cared about working hard, and no news could get into Shanhaiguan. It's not to let people praise us or flatter us, just as long as they understand us. Everyone knows what we are doing and why, then we will die content!"</p>
<p>The next day, he asked me to write something as a souvenir. I objectively described his character:</p>
<p>"Greatness lies in the ordinary, sharpness is contained within, not boasting, not belittling, is the true color of a hero, the spirit of a fighter."</p>
<p>He happily picked it up and wrote a piece for me.</p>
<p>"Our slogan with our brothers is to not fear death and not disturb the people. The Northeast is ours. We won't give it away for nothing, and they can't take it for nothing!"</p>

<h3>Ancient Porcelain Vase Stolen and Sold in Putian; Valued at 5,000 Yuan and Shipped to Shanghai; Locals Plan to Redeem and Preserve It</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The "Heavenly Consort," generally worshiped by sailors, is a woman surnamed Lin from Xinghua, Fujian. The people of Fujian especially worship her, calling her "Mazu." The Mazu Temple in Meizhou, Xinghua, originally housed a five-colored porcelain coral vase from the Ming Dynasty, worth a great deal. It had been lost for more than thirty years. It was recently discovered that it was obtained by Lin Buqing, a deceased clerk from the Qianyi Post Office in Putian City. Lin bribed a young monk in the temple, obtained the vase, and replaced it with a cauldron. The people of Meizhou once filed a lawsuit over this matter. The young monk hanged himself, but there was no evidence, and the matter was dropped. After Lin died, his family fell on hard times. His son was tempted to sell the vase. A secondhand goods dealer introduced him to Zhang Yuanyuan, a secondhand goods dealer in Fuzhou, for a price of 5,000 yuan. On September 21st, Lin Shou's sister and several other people transported the vase to the province, and the money and goods were exchanged. Lin Shou is currently working as an apprentice printer at the Puyang Printing Bureau in Putian. Recently, the printing bureau was reorganized, and shareholder Ruan Huilao encouraged Shou to invest. Therefore, he was introduced to sell the vase, so that he could obtain funds to buy a printing press. It is said that the vase has been shipped to Shanghai. Upon hearing the news, local figures and the director of the Meizhou Joint Security Office are now negotiating with Lin Shou's family and are also contacting fellow villagers overseas to intercept the vase so that it can be redeemed to preserve the antiquity. According to reports, the vase is more than two feet tall. According to eyewitnesses, it has a red background and five colors, with eight round bellies. Each round belly depicts landscapes and ancient temples. There are a total of eight ancient temples. The coral color is red, which is extremely beautiful. It is said that there are three sister vases of the same type made in the same kiln. One is on Nanri Island, with a green background. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Lin Shoushou bought it for 4,000 yuan. One is in the Lingyun Temple in Hushan, with a white background. Thirty years ago, a monk in the temple sold it to a secondhand goods dealer in Fuzhou, who transported it to Putian County. The local people discovered it and chased it back. It is now stored in Thirty-Six Villages. It is also said that this vase caused a clan fight, resulting in seven deaths. Another coral red vase in the Mazu Temple in Meizhou is also the most exquisite. (October 4th)</p>
<h3>A Review of Trade Surpluses, Trade Deficits, and China's Trade Balance (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Luo Dunwei</p>
<p>Lecture on the Central Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>Listeners! Today I am here to lecture on this topic - A Review of Trade Surpluses, Trade Deficits, and China's Trade Balance. It should be divided into two parts to explain: First, I will briefly talk about the theory related to trade surpluses and trade deficits, and then discuss the situation of China's trade surplus and trade deficit.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the meaning of trade surplus and trade deficit. What is called a trade surplus? In international trade, the total value of a country's exported goods exceeds the value of imported goods, and the difference in between is called a trade surplus. In other words, the total value of exported goods is larger, and the total value of imported goods is smaller. For example, if the total value of exported goods is 100 million yuan, and the total value of imports is only 60 million yuan, the difference of 40 million yuan is a trade surplus of 40 million yuan. Because more goods are exported, more foreign money can be earned, which is good for the country. Therefore, trade surplus is also called Favorable Balance. A trade deficit is just the opposite of this: that is, in international trade, the total value of imported goods is greater than the total value of exported goods. In other words, more is imported and less is exported. Of course, foreign countries earn more money from this country, which is detrimental to this country. Because of the annual trade deficit, more money flows out to the outside, which will inevitably lead to the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth, so people generally call the phenomenon of trade deficit an Unfavorable Balance.</p>
<p>The above is a simple explanation of trade surplus and trade deficit based on international trade. As for further research on the actual situation of trade surplus and trade deficit and its impact on national economy and people's livelihood, it is not so simple. Because the international economic transactions are complex and there are many types. Commodity transactions are only a group of international economic transactions. They can only represent a part of the phenomenon and cannot represent the whole. British scholar G. Grunz first combined international commodity transactions, capital transactions, and people transactions into an overall international economic balance. Since then, if everyone wants to study the international economic balance, they should not only pay attention to commodity transactions, but also take into account all aspects of people transactions and capital transactions; that is, they should not only see the tangible trade deficit and trade surplus, but also further pay attention to the intangible trade deficit and trade surplus. Suppose a country imports 10,000 yuan in commodity transactions every year and exports 60 million yuan. However, on the other hand, because its overseas Chinese have very developed businesses and earn a lot of profits every year, suppose it can have 70 million yuan of funds remitted back to the country, then, in addition to offsetting the trade deficit of 40 million yuan in commodity transactions, there is still an excess of 30 million yuan. In fact, in terms of international economic balance, it is not only not a trade deficit, but also a trade surplus of 30 million yuan. By analogy, it can be imagined that the trade surplus and trade deficit mentioned earlier can only be said in terms of commodity transactions. If we talk about the entire international economic balance, then the situation is not so simple. Therefore, in 1924, the League of Nations adopted the international economic balance calculation method proposed by experts (proposed by French representative M. de Foville and Austrian representative Sgruare Gruber at the International Statistical Society in 1905) to settle the international economic balance. Because this topic cannot be discussed in too much detail, I will not talk about the theoretical aspects of trade surplus and trade deficit in detail.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about China's international economic balance, that is, a review of China's trade surplus and trade deficit.</p>
<p>Since 1864 (the third year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), the trend of China's foreign trade has always maintained a long-term trade deficit, except for a very small number of years (such as 1872 to 1876), and it has increased year by year. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it amounted to more than 880 million yuan, and the huge number is even more alarming. The total value of China's foreign trade in the most recent year has now been made into a statistical table. Every year there is a trade deficit, except for the 16th year of the Republic of China when there was only more than 14 million yuan, every year it is about 300 million yuan. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it reached 80.4 million yuan; in the 21st year, it was 88 million yuan; and in the 22nd year, it was 73.3 million yuan. Since then, due to the high silver price and the weak purchasing power of the people, they could not buy a large amount of foreign goods; therefore, the value of import and export goods has decreased at the same time, but the annual trade deficit is still not small. The amount for the 22nd-23rd years was 49.45 million yuan. This year, because the international trade situation is relatively better after the implementation of the legal tender policy last year. However, the trade deficit for the first half of the year from January to June is still 12.6 million yuan. Based on the whole year, it will definitely be around 26 million yuan, which is similar to the trade deficit in the 14th year of the Republic of China. Such a long-term and huge trade deficit is of course a very big threat to the national economy. This is really a national crisis, and I will now review it separately.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Economic Conditions in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Shanghai market this year is still relatively stable. Since the devaluation of the gold franc, the price of gold and foreign exchange has seemed to have risen suddenly. There have been waves, sharp rises and falls, and tremendous panic. In the autumn when countries are competing to expand their military equipment, Europe is restless and unsettled, and the situation in East Asia is changing rapidly. No wonder speculators are active. However, if we are in a dangerous situation, and we are just disturbed, it is not helpful. Just like buying gold and drafts, how long can it be enjoyed? Price manipulation, how much profit can be obtained? Not to mention waiting for someone, abandoning what others want, and taking what others give. It is really difficult to say where the great benefits will eventually return.</p>
<p>In today's world, economic conditions are the most important thing to deal with any kind of contingency. In terms of economic conditions, what do we have? What are we preparing for? What is the determination to sacrifice for each person? "Do not seek to avoid danger in times of difficulty. Do not seek to obtain wealth dishonestly." I wonder if everyone can have this spirit and ambition? All of these are things that we should pay close attention to. Especially in economic organization, materials should be complete and perfect. The command should be quick and agile. Steps should be aligned and unified. Only then can we cope with extraordinary situations. If we do not plan for this, but disrupt the steps ourselves, it is lamentable.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Sufficient food, sufficient military equipment, and the people will trust you." For more than twenty years, the import of foreign rice has increased year by year. The consumption of foreign wheat is also considerable. Once the sea is disturbed and foreign grain is cut off, domestic worries are worrisome. Fortunately, in the past year or two, domestic harvests have been acceptable. The import of food has suddenly become scarce, and the export of rice has suddenly increased. This year is said to be a bumper year. Although the rice has not yet been fully harvested, the weather is smooth. The late rice harvest will not be too bad. However, a bumper harvest means cheap grain. Cheap grain means harming farmers. Only by speeding up the preparation of grain reserves can we reap a double benefit.</p>
<p>As for the plan for accumulation and storage, they are competing to put forward the saying of warehouses. Indeed, how can we talk about accumulation and storage without warehouses? But how to equip the warehouse is a big problem. If the equipment is not good and the construction is poor, the stored grain is easily spoiled. In the autumn of events, it still cannot be used. The reason why it was difficult for the old accumulation and storage to be effective was precisely because they did not know how to choose a location, divide the area, build a warehouse to accommodate it, and instead used local temples and public offices, making do with what they had. Therefore, the grain had steamed and changed within half a year of storage. Today, when we talk about accumulation and storage, how can we repeat the old mistakes? We should choose a central location in the rice-producing area, add equipment for cleaning and drying grain, and build ventilated and dry warehouses. If our country really has a plan for the people's food in extraordinary times, we should start planning quickly and not delay it.</p>
<h3>Amidst Japanese Army Maneuvers, a Hurricane Violently Strikes Hokkaido; Governor-General's Office Roof Is Torn Off; Telegraph and Railway Traffic Are Cut Off</h3>
<p>Sapporo On the morning of the 4th, Hokkaido suddenly had a hurricane with wind speeds of more than 17 meters per second, accompanied by heavy rain. At noon, the wind and rain became even stronger, causing the roof of the Governor-General's Office and Sapporo East Elementary School to be blown down.

The decorations for welcoming the Emperor were mostly blown down. The police are on high alert around the Hokkaido University Faculty of Agriculture, which is the site of the headquarters. As a result, some damage occurred on the railroads. The telegraph and telephone lines were also completely cut off, and the only way to make contact was through the shortwave radio station at the Rakuseki Radio Station, which was specially equipped for the Emperor's visit. In addition, in Kushiro City, two households were buried due to a cliff collapse, and a father and eight children died tragically. (4th, Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Sapporo The North and South armies in the grand maneuvers bravely launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle in the face of violent storms on the morning of the 4th.

<p>Aomori: In the Oono Village area of Higashitsugaru County, due to the fierce wind that struck the Aomori Prefecture area, all forty houses were washed away. Asamushi Onsen was also hit by raging waves, and all the inns and streets were flooded. The villagers all fled to the foothills, creating a tragic scene. In addition, 3.5 million boxes of apples produced in Aomori Prefecture fell from the trees, causing 3.5 million yuan in damage. (4th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Virtually No Intact Houses on Hachijo Island</h3>
<p>Hachijo Island: The typhoon that passed through Hachijo Island at noon on the 3rd had wind speeds of over 50 meters per second, causing extremely severe damage to the entire island. Communication facilities on the island are completely cut off, making damage assessment very difficult. In Mikone Village, which suffered the most damage, not a single house is intact, and all the utility poles are lying on the ground. Forty houses have collapsed, and over one hundred have been partially collapsed. The Oga Township also suffered considerable damage, and due to the raging waves at Yaene Port, all forty fishing boats on the shore were washed away. The rice paddies are filled with seawater. It is difficult to obtain information about the other three villages for the time being, but the damage must be significant. The known damage to crops, fishing boats, and other mountain forests is approximately 200,000 yuan. (4th, Domei News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Naval Exercise on the Northeast Coast of Scotland: Using Radio-Controlled Aircraft to Attack Giant Warships</h3>
<p>(London) Tomorrow, the British Home Fleet will gather off the northeast coast of Scotland to conduct the most realistic war games. At the same time, all of Britain's radio-controlled "Queen Bee" aircraft will begin their first large-scale test. It is said that all the aircraft's attack actions will be controlled by the fleet from several miles away. In addition, many real aircraft will participate in the war games, attacking the world's most powerful battleships, the "Rodney" and "Nelson." The two ships will also return fire. These battleships, armed with 16-inch guns, have been allocated a large amount of ammunition for large-scale combat maneuvers. At the same time, many cruisers, destroyers, and submarines will assist the main battleships in defending against the aircraft attacks. Britain's recently improved fire control system is recognized as the most accurate in the world and will be tested in the field for the first time. It is rumored that the "Conqueror" class cruiser, equipped with 8-inch guns, will concentrate its fire on the radio-controlled battleship "Centurion" within 20 seconds. This ship will travel at maximum speed and make 17 direct hits within three minutes. These week-long exercises will remain strictly secret, as in the past. In addition, news has it that the British naval construction program is now six months ahead of schedule, with no fewer than eighty warships under construction or on order. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Celebrating Harvest Festival: Germany Displays Military Might, Exercises Warfare at the Foot of the Bückeberg, Hitler Delivers a Speech in Person</h3>

<h3>German 10,000-Ton Warship "Scharnhorst" Launched: The First Since the European War</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of July 1935, Germany was allowed to build battleships of 26,000 tons. The first of these battleships, named "Scharnhorst," was launched this morning in the Wilhelmshaven port. The ceremony was presided over by Führer Hitler himself. The ship is equipped with many large guns, the largest of which has a caliber of 28 centimeters. This is the largest warship built by Germany since 1917. The 28,000-ton battleship "Württemberg" and the 31,000-ton cruisers "Spee" and "Mackensen" built by Germany in 1917 were not completed by the end of the war. Later, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany could not build warships of more than 10,000 tons. Therefore, the "Scharnhorst" is the first large warship built by Germany in 20 years.

<h3>Large-Scale Demonstrations by Left and Right Wings in London and Paris: Authorities in Both Countries on High Alert</h3>
<p>(London) Tomorrow afternoon, major disturbances may occur in the East End of London, because the Blackshirts, organized by Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party, are scheduled to march and demonstrate in the Jewish residential area of the East End. After the march, they also plan to divide into four teams and hold mass rallies in four different places in London. Regarding this matter, the mayors of five London suburbs have protested, but the Home Office has not yet issued an order to prohibit it. As for the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party, they have called on sympathizers to start an anti-fascist demonstration half an hour before the Blackshirts' demonstration tomorrow afternoon to resist. Therefore, there is a risk of conflict between the two sides. Jewish residents are quite panicked, and merchants and pubs in the areas through which the march will pass feel uneasy. It is expected that the walls and sidewalks on both sides of the major streets through which the Blackshirts' march is scheduled to pass are now covered with slogans written in white powder, such as "Stop Fascism" and "Do not let a single Blackshirt pass." Therefore, police officers in the East End have been ordered not to take leave tomorrow, and it is estimated that 3,000 police officers will be on the streets tomorrow to maintain order. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Communist Party is scheduled to hold a demonstration in the "Parc des Princes" at 3 PM today. After midnight yesterday, 200 to 300 party members entered the park to make preparations. By this morning, many youths from the right-wing Social Problems Research Association (reorganized from the Croix-de-Feu) were patrolling around the park, but were dispersed by the police. In order to prevent incidents, the authorities have decided to dispatch 20,000 riot police and police officers to guard the area, and several fire trucks have been deployed nearby with the hoses all lined up, so that if any demonstrators act out of line, they can be suppressed with water cannons. According to Colonel La Rocque, the leader of the Social Problems Research Association, if the parties belonging to the Popular Front hold a large-scale rally, the association will hold a counter-demonstration. This is why the authorities have taken strict precautionary measures. (4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>French Government Prevents Soaring Prices: Currency Reform is the Starting Point for Prosperity; Speculation and Profiteering will be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government is now planning to severely punish those who raise prices without legitimate reason as a result of the devaluation of the franc. The government will post notices throughout the country, announcing that the new currency law is the starting point for a new era of prosperity, but it will only be effective if prices are stable. The government believes that lowering tariffs can prevent unreasonable price increases, and believes that most industrialists and merchants will oppose price gouging. The notice ends by telling the public that if there are any incidents of price gouging, they can report it to the authorities, who will punish them severely. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Polish Currency Not Devalued</p>

<p>Italy Considers Currency Policy</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini and his advisors will conclude their consultations on the lira issue tomorrow. The cabinet will meet at 10 AM tomorrow to discuss the issue. It is expected that a communiqué will be issued after the meeting. It is generally believed that the lira should only be devalued when global currency adjustments are successful. It is also believed that increasing the value of the lira can greatly benefit the tourism industry. Foreign tourists can now exchange 92 lira for every pound sterling, compared to 82 previously, while the current listed price is only 64. The export industry can also benefit from the corresponding increase in export taxes. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Czech Republic Drafts New Currency Law</p>

<p>Prague: After the Czech currency, the Crown, was decided to be devalued, Congress granted full authority to the government to prevent price increases and increases in the cost of living. The budget for 1937 has already been compiled, and according to the government's estimates, the difference between income and expenditure is only 1 million Crowns. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Finance Minister Traxler and National Bank Governor Kienböck recently declared that although the Czech currency has been devalued, Austria does not plan to reduce the value of the Schilling. (4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Paris Labor Strike: Government Mediation Leads to Settlement</h3>
<p>(Paris) The strike of employees of hotels, cafes, and pubs in Paris, which began this month, subsided at night. After the government intervened in mediation, labor and management signed an agreement, and all will resume work tomorrow. Although the streets of Paris were disrupted for a day, they have now returned to their former state. The strike situation today was most serious in several large cafes. Some of them were occupied by strikers who refused to leave from 2 AM, and were dispersed by the police at 11 AM. As a result, major cafes on the prosperous streets of Paris were closed, but small cafes operated as usual, with employers and their families personally serving. Most pub employees did not obey the strike order, but employers closed their businesses out of fear of incidents. Only a small number of hotels closed. By nightfall, the police had arrested 62 people to maintain traffic, but they were soon released. As a result, order on the streets was quite calm. After the strike broke out, State Councilor Taurmo intervened in mediation and convened representatives of labor and management, eight from each side, at the Ministry of Labor at 5 PM to hold arbitration. An agreement was reached on wage levels, and the strike ended. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<h3>Austrian Heimwehr: Two Factions Face Off</h3>
<p>(Vienna) After a dispute between Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Patriotic Heimwehr, and Major Fey, the former leader of the Vienna Provincial Patriotic Heimwehr, the Vienna Provincial Patriotic Heimwehr is now divided into two factions, facing each other. One faction is led by Major Klos, who is recognized by Starhemberg. The other faction is still led by Major Fey and Vienna Deputy Mayor Rall. This faction has submitted a petition to President Miklas and Chancellor Schuschnigg. In addition, the Tyrol Provincial Patriotic Heimwehr branch has also sent a telegram to Major Fey, expressing its support, stating that Chancellor Schuschnigg does not intend to interfere in the internal affairs of the Patriotic Heimwehr. Even semi-official political commentary has been issued, treating both factions of the Patriotic Heimwehr equally, without taking sides. (4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Eight Small Islands in the South Pacific Incorporated into British Territory: Militarily Important, Arouses Repercussions in German Newspapers</h3>
<p>(London) The government announced today that Britain has incorporated eight islands in the Phoenix Islands in the South Pacific. Two small ships belonging to the New Zealand fleet erected signs on the islands stating "This island belongs to His Majesty King Edward VIII." Although the total area of the eight islands is only 160,000 miles and the population is only 60 people, they are quite valuable from a naval point of view. After this news was released, the Berlin newspaper "Angriff" reacted, saying that Britain's move was a prelude to Australia's future incorporation of the entire Arctic region. Britain's expansion of territory in this way can be seen as a blatant display of territorial ambition and a lack of fairness regarding Germany's colonial demands. According to reports, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels was previously the editor of this newspaper. (3rd, Guomin Dian)</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Mass Migrate to the South Seas</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to develop the economic resources of the South Seas, the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs has decided to implement mass migration in accordance with the methods used for migration to Manchuria. However, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, in view of Japan's intentions, which could lead to serious consequences, have enacted immigration laws to restrict it. Therefore, Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagata recently repeatedly decided to convene Foreign Ministry America Bureau Director Okamoto, and Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Directors Isoya and Toyoda, Commerce and Industry Ministry Trade Bureau Director Terao, etc., to conduct important consultations and have formulated a southern migration plan and are actively proceeding.

<h3>League of Nations Assembly Enters Third Week: Important Representatives from Various Countries Depart Geneva One After Another; Impatience with Slow Progress; Poland to Demand Redistribution of Colonies Based on Overpopulation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The work of the League of Nations Assembly will enter its third week tomorrow. The current Assembly is expected to last one more week. The first week was spent dealing with the issue of the Abyssinian delegate's attendance and organizing the bureau and committees. The second week was spent holding a general debate on political issues and reviewing the activities of the League of Nations over the past year. In the third week, the committees will finalize their work and announce their adjournment. Currently, many delegates from various countries have expressed boredom and complained about the slow progress of the Assembly's work. As a result, an increasing number of chief delegates from various countries are leaving for other destinations. For example, Czech Foreign Minister Krofta, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and French Prime Minister Blum have all returned home one after another. French Foreign Minister Delbos and former Minister without Portfolio Pongot are also scheduled to depart tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for the French proposal to convene the bureau of the Disarmament Conference, people in various countries have expressed their sympathy. During a recent meeting of the Third Committee of the League of Nations Assembly on disarmament issues, the four major powers of Italy, the United States, Japan, and Germany were not represented, and people increasingly felt the importance of the disarmament issue and believed that it needed to be re-discussed. In addition, the Second Committee of the Assembly, namely the Committee on Financial and Economic Matters, is scheduled to hold a meeting in the next two days. The French delegate, namely Commerce Minister Baste, will submit a document to the committee to explain the French government's views on international economic and financial issues. The discussions are sure to be of interest. It is expected that after holding the meeting two or three times, the committee will pass a report and a resolution, which will be submitted to the Administrative Council and the Assembly for review. However, whether the Administrative Council and the Assembly will advocate convening the Economic and Financial Committee of the League of Nations or apply to those countries that are most concerned about the recovery of the world economy to consult before convening a large-scale economic conference will be decided after reviewing the Second Committee's report and resolution. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Poland will submit a request to the League of Nations next week for the redistribution of colonies and raw materials. Regarding this matter, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently issued a statement in Geneva, which was also published here. The statement said that Poland only produces 10 of the 24 major raw materials in the world, and even the quantity of these 10 is insufficient. Furthermore, the Polish population increases by 400,000 people every year, making it one of the most overpopulated countries in the world. There are 3.5 million Jews among the Polish residents, and 80,000 of them need to be resettled abroad every year. Other countries must also be in the same situation as Poland. In addition, it is understood that the government has summoned Beck back to Beijing for consultations due to the new situation created by the devaluation of various currencies. (4th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Expansion of the League of Nations Administrative Council: China's Election is Doubtless</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly has adopted the resolution of the First Committee, which stipulates that two new temporary non-permanent council seats should be established in the Administrative Council. It is heard that China and Latvia will be elected to fill these seats tomorrow or Tuesday. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Terrorism: Old Topic Re-Raised</h3>
<p>Focus of Discussion in the First Committee</p>
<p>(Geneva) The issue of cracking down on terrorism has now become the focus of discussion in the First Committee of the League of Nations Assembly (namely, the Committee on Jurisprudence and Regulations). Following the Marseille tragedy in October 1934, when Yugoslav King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou were assassinated, the League of Nations decided to establish a special committee of jurists to study the issue of international joint crackdown on terrorism. The committee of jurists then decided to submit two draft conventions to the member states of the League of Nations: one is the draft convention on prohibiting and preventing terrorism, and the other is the draft convention on establishing an international criminal court. The First Committee of the League of Nations Assembly is now discussing whether to convene a conference of diplomats from various countries to study the above two drafts. It is heard that the drafts submitted by the committee of jurists have aroused some objections from the First Committee. Among them, the representatives of Belgium, Sweden, and Norway believe that the draft convention's definition of terrorism is too broad, and that the result will be that most countries will abandon their legislative powers and that political criminals can be extradited, which is not without its drawbacks. On the contrary, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and France all support the above draft. French representative Pongou also pointed out that if an international criminal court can be established, the rights of political prisoners can still be guaranteed. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Blum Swiftly Returns to Paris</h3>
<p>Satisfied with Geneva Talks</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum, together with his wife, returned to Paris from Geneva at 8:15 AM this morning. The Greek Ambassador to France, Politis, also accompanied them in the same car. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Prime Minister Blum left Geneva by car at 10 PM last night, swiftly returning to Paris. Before his departure, he issued an important declaration to the press, the gist of which was: "I am returning with a full sense of optimism. In Geneva, I met with diplomatic representatives from Britain, the Soviet Union, the Little Entente countries, Poland, Turkey, Belgium, and Sweden. Based on my impressions, the friendly relations between these countries and France remain unchanged. There is no cause for concern or alarm. Some people worry that preparations for the Locarno Five-Power Conference will alienate France from some countries (presumably referring to the Soviet Union). I believe such concerns are unfounded. Since the Anglo-French-Belgian London Conference in July, we have been preparing to convene the Locarno Conference and will certainly strive for its success without any negligence. However, when we first proposed the Locarno Conference, it was decided that its agenda would focus on resolving general European problems. This should not be forgotten by the world. Regarding the Disarmament Conference, at a time when all European countries are competing to expand their armaments in a race against each other, some people doubt that France's desire to reopen disarmament negotiations is a delusion. However, I believe otherwise. In my view, initiating the reconvening of the Disarmament Conference at this time is reasonable and necessary. Precisely because the dangers of the arms race are becoming more profound and the burden of military spending on the people is becoming heavier, it is all the more necessary to conclude international agreements to limit the expansion of armaments. Furthermore, the recent devaluation of the French franc and the establishment of a currency agreement between Britain, the United States, and France will undoubtedly usher in a new era for economic relations among European countries and even the world. This morning, the French government has ordered a reduction in current tariff rates, which is an effect of currency reform. France is fortunate to be a model in this regard and hopes that other countries will follow suit and reduce tariff barriers, so that the economic situation may be revived." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Palestine Situation Eases; Suspension of Curfew Order; Strike Wave Expected to End</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Since the arrival of British reinforcements and the implementation of strict measures by the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Lieutenant General Dill, to curb the riots, illegal activities throughout Palestine have greatly decreased in the past week. After the stationing of defense forces in various towns, a sense of calm prevails. Many Arab shopkeepers have reopened their stores, and soldiers are buying goods in large numbers. It is reported that the government, seeing the hope of resolving the Arab strike, plans to temporarily suspend the implementation of the curfew order in Palestine. Last night, the Arab Higher Committee met all day to discuss revisions to the mediation methods to be submitted to the four Arab kings: King Ibn Saud of Hejaz, King Abdullah of Transjordan, King Ghazi of Iraq, and King Yahya of Yemen, to mediate the labor unrest. The Arab community is showing optimism. The committee is also discussing the declaration to be issued upon receiving the four kings' mediation petition. At the same time, there is widespread fear that the four kings' peace efforts may be harmed by traditional mutual jealousies. Arabs value the efforts of King Ibn Saud more than those of Iraqi Foreign Minister Nuri Pasha, which may provoke resentment from King Ghazi. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>England-South Africa Air Race; Last Plane Crashes; Pilot Safe</h3>
<p>Johannesburg: The only remaining competitor in the Portsmouth-Johannesburg Air Race, Mr. Clouston, has given up hope of winning the obstacle race prize after his "Miles Hawk" aircraft crashed and was destroyed near Gwelo (in Southern Rhodesia). Fortunately, Mr. Clouston and his passenger, Mr. Tesca, are both safe. Mr. Clouston could have won the aforementioned prize if he had arrived in Johannesburg before 6:30 AM this morning. Unexpectedly, Mr. Clouston was forced to make four landings yesterday. The last time was at Mpokwe, 90 miles from Salisbury. He intended to continue flying immediately, as the plane only needed twelve gallons of gasoline, which would be sufficient to fly to Salisbury. People there were quite anxious because Mr. Clouston did not arrive on time, and they all thought that he must have encountered misfortune along the way. Only after the news of Mr. Clouston's plane being destroyed in Gwelo came today did they learn the truth. Of the nine aircraft that took off from Portsmouth, only one, the "Vega Gull" aircraft piloted by Mr. Scott and Mr. Guthrie, arrived in Johannesburg. Now that Mr. Clouston's plane has crashed and been destroyed, this grand air race has come to an end, as Mr. Smith, who was competing with Mr. Clouston, also flew to Khartoum yesterday and withdrew. Two people lost their lives in this race, namely Mr. Findlay and Mr. Llewellyn, who both died in plane crashes when taking off from Al-Abyad. However, Mr. Findlay's assistant, Mr. Waller, and another passenger escaped unharmed. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Rural Life Sketches: The Lookout Post in Taixing Village (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qing-tang, Qi Feng</p>
<p>It has been three full years since I escaped our desolate hometown of Taixing, located in a remote corner of Jiangbei. My father often says in his letters: "Our hometown is becoming less and less like a decent place." Whenever I heard my father's disheartened words, I could not help but feel strange, and I would think: "This is probably just the nervous reaction of his old age?" However, based on my experience of staying in my hometown for a month during last year's summer vacation, I felt that what my father said was absolutely true. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about the lookout post.</p>
<p>This lookout post is located in a village called Wangjia'an in my hometown. The predecessor of the residence was a public security sub-bureau. Later, due to administrative changes, the public security sub-bureau was changed to a public security outpost. The public security outpost was established for less than a year, and I don't know why it was changed to the current lookout post. Farmers don't understand these names. Although the name of the lookout post has been changed for nearly two years, they still call it the public security bureau. But in fact, it is not much different from the public security bureau. It can catch gamblers, deal with opium smokers, and also accept various lawsuits. Its authority is actually even greater than that of the public security bureau. It is said that in the era of the public security sub-bureau, the bureau had more than three thousand yuan of "extra income" every month. The same was true in the era of the public security outpost. In the era of the lookout post, the income was a bit less "prosperous" because there was really nothing to extort from the villagers. However, thanks to the ability and efforts of the "director" (1) of the lookout post, there was still at least five or six hundred yuan of income per month.</p>
<p>The history of this "director" of the lookout post is also very long. It is said that he was a tailor by profession. Because he was very bold and extremely alert, he also did a lot of killing and arson during the great turmoil of bandits in my hometown in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Later, when the power of the bandits was slightly reduced and the whole township was nervously arresting bandits, he relied on his alertness to report an important bandit and surrender himself. Because of this merit, he was appointed to the current position of "director."</p>
<p>On the fourth day after I arrived home, a robbery occurred in the village. The victim was a small merchant who had moved to the village from another township less than two years ago. The owner's surname was Li. He went out to do business, and his wife stayed at home to farm and make a living. Economically, they were relatively well-off in the village, but because of this, they could not live peacefully in the countryside. The robbery occurred in the evening. There were a total of five or six thieves who entered the house. It is said that they did not get any money, but only took thirty or forty pieces of new and old clothing for men and women. Later, someone shouted that there was too little "oil," so they ended up stuffing several bags of wheat into their trousers and skirts and left.</p>
<p>After the incident, the villagers were initially very disturbed and agitated all day long. Later, I don't know why, everyone suddenly became silent and stopped talking about it. Why? "This was done by the people from Wangjia'an!" Only after my family quietly told me this did I suddenly realize that this was the trick the people from the lookout post were playing. I said, "Why doesn't the Li family report it to the county?" "Report it to the county? Who dares to report it? They are connected with the people above. What's the use of reporting it?"</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere in the village had only cleared up for less than a week when suddenly another incident was staged before everyone's eyes, which was the matter of the lookout post accusing the night watchman Liu Laotian of being a suspect in the Li family robbery. Liu Laotian was a poor man in our village who was already over fifty years old. He was the only one in his family. Because he was old and unable to farm the rented land any longer, he found this job as a night watchman two years ago to spend his remaining years. Everyone in the village unhesitatingly acknowledged Liu Laotian's loyalty and dedication. His ability to obtain this job as a night watchman was entirely based on these four words of loyalty and dedication. But this time, the lookout post forcibly accused him of being a robbery suspect. Liu Laotian was arrested by the people from the lookout post early one day when he was eating dinner. From then on, unbearable news kept leaking out from Wangjia'an, saying that Liu Laotian had been hungry for two days without food in the "bureau," or that Liu Laotian's legs had been broken by the people in the "bureau." After some time, it was said that Liu Laotian had confessed and taken out six yuan to be released. Two days later, Liu Laotian was indeed found sleeping on his own bed. According to what he told people about his experiences in the lookout post, it was almost exactly the same as what the villagers had heard. But where did Liu Laotian's six yuan come from? In the end, weren't the people in our village the ones who suffered?</p>
<p>In addition to the two incidents mentioned above, there is also an incident worth mentioning regarding the lookout post's extortion of the people. Behind our village, a "smoking den" (2) had been secretly opened. Since its opening, this "smoking den" has become a constant source of "extra income" for the lookout post. Before the government's opium prohibition regulations were promulgated, opium smokers were caught and fined by the lookout post every few days. The opium boss was still relatively free at that time, as long as he paid a few opium pills to the people in the "bureau" every time they passed by. But since the implementation of the opium prohibition regulations, it has not been easy for this opium boss to do business either. He also had to go to the lookout post to be fined like the opium smokers. The opium boss could not afford a license, so he had to surrender to the lookout post and pay two yuan a month to keep things quiet. This situation had lasted for almost seven or eight months. Who knew that things would not go smoothly, and the news of this secretly opened opium den was discovered by the county's opium prohibition office. As a result, in addition to confiscating the opium paraphernalia and opium soil, he also had to be fined eighty yuan. The opium boss returned, closed the door of the opium den, and prepared to find another way to make a living. But the lookout post was not willing to let it go easily. They wanted to find him to settle the accounts. The "director" meant that the "special permission fee" of only two yuan per month in the past few months was originally intended for the "opium den" to be opened for a long time. Now that the opium den has closed halfway, the opium boss had to take out dozens more yuan to compensate for the "bureau's" poor harvest in the past few months. This account was really difficult to settle. The two sides were at loggerheads, and until the day I left my hometown, I heard that the opium boss was still being detained in the lookout post and had not been released!</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in North China's Economic and Diplomatic Situation; Economic Cooperation Methods Largely Determined Internally</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, Zhu Zhe-yuan arrived in Tianjin on September 10th, and it has been a month since then. Originally, he planned to return to Ping (Beiping/Beijing) after the Mid-Autumn Festival to preside over political affairs, but due to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and North China's diplomatic matters, he stayed in Tianjin to preside over affairs nearby and liaise with the Japanese side. Therefore, he has repeatedly postponed his return. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Qin De-chun was summoned from Ping. In the afternoon, Song (Zhe-yuan) convened Zhang Zi-zhong, Jia De-yao, Qin De-chun, Song Mei-cun, Wang Shi-jiu, and others at his private residence in the British Concession to discuss general economic and diplomatic countermeasures. A general decision has been made. At 5 PM, Chen Jue-sheng accompanied Qin De-chun to the private residence of Hashimoto Gun, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Army in the Japanese Concession's Flower Garden Street, to inquire about the results of his meeting with staff officers of the Kwantung Army in Changchun on the 29th and 30th of last month. Song planned to return to Ping by special train at 4 PM on the 4th, but because he wanted to meet with Tashiro again before leaving Tianjin for a concrete discussion, he invited all related parties to solicit opinions on the current situation for reference. Song stayed in Tianjin for many days and met with Tashiro three times, discussing both economic and diplomatic matters. The last time, he focused on economic development. Tashiro presented Song with a plan prepared by the military department. Outside sources quickly rumored that an eight-article economic agreement had been concluded, but it is difficult to ascertain its content. However, the military department stipulates that the scope of economic development is divided into six sectors according to their functions: (1) railways, (2) ports, (3) electricity, (4) Lu salt, (5) mines, (6) cotton production. All the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and Jinan-Liaocheng Railway construction, Hai River dredging, Dagu and Qikou port development, North China's electricity business, cotton production improvement, establishment of rural cooperatives, establishment of North China Salt Industry Company, and Longyan Iron Mine exploitation that have been widely rumored in North China for the past six months are all included. Gan Ke-min, Director of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee, has resigned, and the replacement has not yet been determined. Song previously favored Jia De-yao as an agent, but Jia is not the right talent, and the Japanese side does not approve much. Song cannot feel at ease employing outsiders. Recently, there has been talk of re-employing Xiao Zhen-ying. On the diplomatic side, three meetings were held, combining each other's opinions. The key is still to emphasize the clarification of political power. However, the clarification that the Japanese side is talking about today is not just the clarification of the Hebei-Chahar political power itself, but also requires the extension of this clarification function to all provinces in North China. In other words, it is close to what the Yomiuri Shimbun reported, the construction of a buffer zone of five provinces. Although the Japanese side is constantly pushing for its realization, it is by no means something that Song can handle alone. Therefore, the North China situation presents a cloudy but not rainy, seemingly relaxed but actually tense situation. In general, the diplomatic key lies in Shanghai and Nanjing, and how the recent disputes between China and Japan will evolve. If the Shanghai case and general Sino-Japanese problems can be resolved diplomatically, then North China can temporarily survive. This is not something I dare to predict.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Hashimoto Gun, Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army, researched at the Changchun meeting mostly regarding the Suiyuan-Mongolia area. One more thing is worth noting for the Chinese people. The original capital of the Xingzhong Company was 20 million. The accounting year ended in July this year, and nothing was done. It has already lost 280,000. After that, the Tokyo meeting decided to reorganize and increase the capital to 50 million. Now, not long after, the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) has suggested that the capital be increased again, with Mantetsu as the center, changing it to a joint government-private operation, increasing the capital to 150 million, and designating it as the main organ for economic development under China policy. Mantetsu director Sasaki and president Sogō are both active in Tokyo in this matter, trying to attract the business community to participate enthusiastically. The Kwantung Army Department and the North China Garrison Army Department have agreed and supported its advancement in advance to achieve its goal. If it is realized, it will be no different from the British East India Company. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Use Diplomatic Opportunities to Realize its Ambition to Invade North China</h3>
<p>Just as China and Japan were generally advocating for the adjustment of diplomatic relations, incidents of Japanese people being victimized suddenly occurred successively in Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and the Wusong Road area of Shanghai. The situation immediately became tense. Japanese military and naval officers stationed in China frequently threatened to take extraordinary measures, while the three ministries of the Japanese government—Navy, Army, and Foreign Affairs—were also busy deploying troops and making demands. Warships arrived in droves, and messengers shuttled back and forth, plunging Shanghai into a state of terror reminiscent of the eve of the January 28th Incident. The tense atmosphere in the Yangtze and Pearl River basins also left the Chinese populace feeling uneasy and unable to live peacefully. Would Japan truly launch a war, using the pretext of protecting its nationals to engage in disruptive acts? For five years, Japan's steady encroachment upon and constant threats towards China have exposed the true colors of its warmongering ambitions. It is understandable that the people are apprehensive. However, it would be premature to conclude that Japan intends to escalate this into a full-scale war. Japan's primary focus is on North China. While the annexation of Central and South China may be inevitable in the long run, the timing does not yet seem ripe. I will now elaborate on this. Japan's invasion and seizure of the four northeastern provinces in the September 18th Incident was the beginning of its ambition to encompass all of China. According to the Tanaka Memorial, Japan's invasion of China was intended to be carried out gradually, with each part being defeated separately. This is why, after the September 18th Incident, Japan first instigated a puppet autonomous movement in Hebei and Chahar, then advocated for amity in Central and East China, and secretly engaged in disruptive activities in Fujian. The reason for all this is to implement the deceptive strategy of "befriending nearby states while attacking distant ones" step by step, in order to realize its ambition to conquer "China." The current adoption of an aggressive and forceful stance in response to a series of unfortunate incidents is also intended for this purpose. In simple terms, the goal is to encompass North China. This can be proven by recent events. After the Shanghai incident, Japan immediately demanded that the central government accept its proposed conditions. Among these conditions, besides suppressing the so-called "anti-Japanese" movement, the main point was the establishment of an independent political entity in the five provinces of North China (Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, and Shanxi). Why did Japan propose such unreasonable demands to the Chinese government? There is a reason for this. Although Japan is a military power, its domestic situation is complex, and any action can have widespread repercussions. Therefore, it would not dare to act rashly without absolute certainty, lest it tarnish its past "glory" of winning every battle (such as the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Manchurian Incident). Thus, it seeks to create a tense atmosphere to coerce the Chinese government into giving it legal recognition, achieving its aims through treaties without firing a shot. Although the secret plan that Kuwashima brought with him on this trip to China is unknown, it can be asserted that his primary mission is this. However, we cannot hastily assume that Japan will not resort to barbaric actions against North China, or even Central and South China. Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison, recently met with Commander Ueda and Chiefs of Staff Itagaki and Imamura of the Kwantung Army in Changchun. At that time, they made the following decisions regarding North China: (1) Regarding the instigation of North China's independence, in addition to adhering to the past policy of inciting Chinese traitors to act on their own, to avoid public resentment and international disputes, they agreed to use all their strength to threaten the overall situation in Hebei and Chahar, severing their ties with the central government to bring them to "submission." Besides using political maneuvering to sow discord, the method of threatening the Hebei and Chahar authorities would be to increase the strength of the garrison in proportion to the strength of the 29th Army. This increase in troops would be achieved as much as possible under the guise of commercial groups, volunteer corps, and veterans to avoid causing alarm. (2) They would still await the outcome of the diplomatic negotiations between Kawagoe and Nanjing. If necessary, they would not hesitate to resort to force, with the Kwantung Army and the garrison working closely together. The Kwantung Army would send the bandits and the puppet troops of northern Chahar to attack Datong in Chahar and Suiyuan, while the garrison would attack the 29th Army, forcing it to willingly break away from the motherland. (3) They would request that the Navy concentrate its fleet in Jiaozhou Bay when necessary to coerce Han Fuju. From this, it can be seen that the crisis in North China has reached a critical juncture where dangers lurk on all sides. This Sino-Japanese negotiation is related to the survival of all of North China, and we must not ignore it. Do the officials in North China, who are responsible for defending the territory and safeguarding sovereignty, have the determination to avert this crisis? This can be seen in the morale of the 29th Army during the Fengtai incident. Although they had to retreat from Zhao's Village due to orders, their indignant and courageous attitude has already hinted at our future determination to resist foreign aggression. Furthermore, the close ties between Suiyuan and Shanxi in suppressing the puppet troops, and Han Fuju's calm and composed demeanor, all demonstrate their determination to safeguard the territory. It is expected that the Japanese will resort to many tricks and will probably try to use them again. However, we must know that one defeat is worse than ten attacks. To maintain the nation's long-term survival and safeguard territorial sovereignty, we sincerely hope that the actions of the North China authorities will be guided by the central government's policies, and that the central government will have the ultimate determination to rescue the nation from this crisis.

<h3>Smuggling in Southern Fujian Revives Again After the Abolition of the Provincial Tax Investigation Office, the Anhai Datou Smuggling Operation Reactivates</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Smuggling in Southern Fujian had been greatly suppressed by the joint efforts of the Customs and the Provincial Tax Investigation Office on land and sea. The smashing of a major smuggling operation outside Tuomen in Quanzhou on September 13th had chilled the courage of smugglers. However, due to opposition from certain parties, the Provincial Tax Investigation Office was ordered by the provincial government to be abolished on September 19th due to environmental factors. All branch offices throughout the province were closed on September 25th, and smuggling operations along the coast are now vying to revive. The power of the Customs patrol ships is limited to smuggling operations at sea. The coastal smuggling operations are organized by local ruffians and unscrupulous merchants who collude with vagrants. As long as they can break through the Customs' maritime patrols, they can proceed unhindered once they land. According to a dispatch from Anhai on the 2nd, Datou Township in Anhai has a large-scale smuggling operation with a capital of 500,000 yuan. When the 9th Division was stationed in Quanzhou, it sent troops to patrol the township, which slightly suppressed the smuggling. The operation then turned to contact Huang Yansui, the leader of the Xunpu smuggling operation that was recently busted. Most of the smuggling operations in Southern Fujian are run by local ruffians from nearby villages who jointly invest with people from a certain province. They have backing to rely on and many hideouts. If the situation in one place becomes unfavorable, the main operation simply moves to another location. After the establishment of the Tax Investigation branch offices along the coast and the busting of the Xunpu smuggling operation, the Datou smuggling operation was also in imminent danger, and smuggling was temporarily suspended. A week ago, the various Tax Investigation branch offices were ordered to be abolished, and the unscrupulous merchants, seeing an opportunity, immediately took action and continued smuggling. It is reported that private goods are being transported from nearby Shihuh Township, including 50 boxes of kerosene and a consignment of seafood and sundries, worth several thousand yuan. The organizers of the Datou smuggling operation have established contact with their fellow villagers who are engaged in business in Xiamen and Taiwan. A certain person on the other side (i.e., Taiwan) is responsible for insurance. For goods smuggled into Datou, an insurance fee of 2% (i.e., 200 yuan per 1,000 yuan) is charged. This insurance fee is paid when the goods are exported from the other side. If the goods are "lost at sea" or seized by the government, the insurer will compensate for the loss at cost price. Furthermore, many smuggling operations have bribed local personnel. For example, a gangster named Wang from the Anhai Guandi Temple has earned protection money from the operation. With external collusion and internal response, the organization is tightly knit, and seizures are rare, which makes them even bolder. Legitimate merchants have suffered greatly. According to kerosene traders, unscrupulous merchants have made a significant profit from kerosene alone. The kerosene smuggled in is of inferior quality and is sold cheaply. Furthermore, it is not subject to Customs import duties. Each box contains two cans and is sold for just over four yuan. The legitimate merchants who import Mobil and Asiatic oil after paying taxes have to sell it for nine yuan and fifty cents. There is a difference of five yuan per box, making it impossible to compete. The same is true for other goods, leaving legitimate merchants with no choice but to surrender.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Cargo Ship Sinks Fishing Boat</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the British-owned company Henry Waugh &amp; Co., located at 120 Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, dispatched the Taimei No. 1 cargo ship, towing two barges, to transport goods to Suzhou. That evening at 11:00 PM, it set sail from the Wusong River. On the morning of the 3rd, while passing through Xinwuku Port in the county jurisdiction, it collided with Song Fugen's fishing boat. The fishing boat immediately capsized, and Zhu and Zhang Shenglou fell into the water. After being rescued by the boatmen on the ship, Song Fugen was rescued due to the rapid current. Zhang Shenglou drowned and disappeared without a trace. At that time, more than a hundred villagers from nearby villages, seeing that a life had been lost, gathered to surround the ship and prevent it from sailing. The police chief of the Xinwuku Patrol Station, Huanjun, immediately reported it to the County Public Security Bureau. Section Chief Yu personally requested Magistrate Li to handle the matter. Considering the seriousness of the matter, he immediately ordered Section Chief Yu to hire a car to go to Shanghai to negotiate with the company. As a result, the company provided a written guarantee, taking responsibility for the aftermath, and the cargo ship was allowed to proceed. Section Chief Yu returned to Songjiang that night to report. Magistrate Li then ordered Zheng Zanting, the platoon leader of the 12th Brigade of the Security Corps, to lead a team, together with Huang Hexiao, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, to the scene of the accident at dawn on the 4th to persuade the people to allow the ship to sail. At the same time, Song Fugen and Zhang Shenglou's father, Shaogen, and the ship's driver, Ma Zhangzhang, were taken to the bureau. The court was convened at 3:00 PM. The victim's side requested compensation and condolence money. It is said that Zhang Shenglou's body has not yet been recovered.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Sixth District Detains Suspects</p>
<p>Based on a confidential report, the Sixth District Office of the county stated that five monks were wandering along the road under the pretext of begging for alms, looking anxious. They immediately dispatched personnel to detain them. When questioned, they spoke evasively. Upon inspecting their clothing, each person had a strip of black cloth sewn into the bottom of their sleeves, and a piece of red paper with blurry and unrecognizable characters was found in their watch pockets. A written document was immediately prepared and sent to the county for review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Scheduled Opening of the Wuqing Road</p>
<p>The roadbed of the Wuqing Highway has been completed, and paving has begun. The construction is proceeding unusually quickly. Recently, about two or three kilometers of the Dingyan to Qishuyan section in the county territory, and about one kilometer of the Qishuyan to Henglin section have not yet been completed, but they are all rushing to finish the paving before the National Day. The Wuqing Motor Company has decided to officially open the road to traffic on National Day. As for the passenger cars used, eight new-style 1936 charcoal-fueled large passenger cars have been ordered from the Ford Motor Company in Shanghai. Four of them were shipped from Shanghai to Changzhou on the 29th of last month, and the remaining four will be shipped to Changzhou when the road officially opens to traffic. The fare is calculated as follows: three cents from the West Gate Terminal to Xiaobeimen, 15 cents from the Terminal to Qishuyan Station, and 25 cents from the Terminal to Henglin. The fare will be implemented after approval from the Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Unification of the Names of Relief Institutions</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, in view of the fact that the names of the relief homes and institutions in various counties, with the exception of the six designated by the Ministry, are not uniform, which hinders verification, has specially revised a survey form to standardize the names. All halls and institutions other than the six designated by the Ministry should change their names according to the nature of the work they do, such as Vagrant Vocational Training Centers, People's Livelihood Factories, Women's Reformatories, and Soup Kitchens. For example, Vagrant Vocational Training Centers should change all names such as Beggar Reception Centers, Vagrant Reformatories, Vagrant Reformatories, and Reform Vocational Training Centers. Similarly, Women's Reformatories should change all names such as Women's Relief Homes and Women and Children's Reformatories. Similarly, People's Livelihood Factories should change all names such as Poor People's Factories and Civilian Factories. It is learned that the department has already sent the survey forms to the regional commissioners, ordering them to instruct the county magistrates to comply and report back as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Jurong</h3>
<p>An Epidemic Outbreak in the Second District</p>
<p>An epidemic is raging in the Second District of Jurong. It was last seen in 1933. Unexpectedly, the bacteria have multiplied again this summer. Currently, more than 50,000 people in the entire district have been infected, and more than 500 have died. The most tragic thing is that several members of a family have died, making it impossible to provide coffins for burial. All the village chiefs and elementary school principals in the entire district have jointly requested relief from the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Unsuccessful Extortion Leads to Suicide</p>
<p>Zhu Zongbao (age 35), son of Zhu Dexin, the owner of an ironsmith shop in Touqiao Town, Third District of Jiangdu, was involved in a matter where Wang Jianhou of Jiangjiagang in Jiangbei borrowed a gold ring worth 40 yuan from Qiu Siniang of Touqiao through his handling. From spring to autumn this year, it has not been returned. Qiu is now urgently demanding its return. If the original item cannot be returned, compensation must be paid at cost. On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, he went to Jiangjiagang alone to find Wang to demand its return. However, Wang refused to open the door. Thinking that he would return empty-handed and unable to explain the situation, he went to Bagangkou on the Mid-Autumn Festival and boarded a boat to Zhenjiang. When the boat reached the center of the river at Monk Island, Zongbao took advantage of the unpreparedness of others and jumped into the river, disappearing with the waves. A passenger surnamed Sun who was on the same boat saw this and specially went to Yujiabanka Jiangkou yesterday (the 2nd) to inquire with Zhu Dexin, his father. Zhu was also inquiring at the pier because his son had not returned. Upon hearing the news, he cried bitterly and wanted to jump into the river as well. Fortunately, many people stopped him, comforting him with the fact that there was no evidence to prove whether Zongbao had drowned, and that it was possible that he had been rescued. He then returned home sobbing. It is also heard that Zhu only had one son, which is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Income Tax Collection Commences as Scheduled</p>
<p>Zhang Sen, a specially appointed commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, came to Hangzhou to guide and urge the collection of income tax in order to promote its smooth implementation. Zhang had discussions with financial authorities and business and financial circles in Hangzhou, and the results were quite satisfactory. According to reports, the salaries of civil servants and interest on bonds have been taxed as scheduled, with various agencies or banks withholding the tax and remitting it to the Central Bank or the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the post office for verification. The remaining taxes will be levied from January 1 of next year. The Ministry of Finance plans to establish collection agencies in various provinces, and the methods are currently under consideration. Zhang will go to Nanchang and Anhui province to negotiate in the coming days, and then return to Beijing to report.</p>
<h3>A Few Famous International Cases of Protecting Overseas Nationals (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Shengwu</p>
<p>The Rock Springs Massacre</p>
<p>The victims of the Rock Springs Massacre were Chinese nationals residing abroad. It occurred on September 2, 1885. This was not the first time that Chinese nationals residing in the United States had been subjected to mob violence, but it was the most serious. There were many Chinese people living in Rock Springs, United States, most of whom built their own houses and engaged in legitimate businesses. Suddenly, on September 2, 1885, they were attacked by lawless mobs. The rioters numbered more than 150 and were armed with firearms. There was no provocative behavior on the part of the Chinese nationals that incited the mobs to attack. At the beginning of the riot, the Chinese were forced to leave their homes. Before they could leave, they were shot at, forcing them to abandon their homes and businesses and flee into the mountains in hopes of saving their lives. Many of them were killed before they could escape, and those who were fleeing were also shot at. Homes and properties were set on fire, and the entire village was reduced to ruins. As a result, 28 Chinese nationals died, 15 were seriously injured, and properties worth US$147,748.74 were burned or looted. After the incident, the United States government sent troops to suppress the riot, preventing it from continuing to escalate. The Chinese Minister to the United States immediately sent the Chinese consuls stationed in San Francisco and New York to the scene to investigate.</p>
<p>On November 30, 1885, Zheng Zhaoru, the Chinese Minister to the United States, prepared a diplomatic note and sent it to Mr. Bayard, the United States Secretary of State, describing the course of the riot. He first expressed his gratitude to the United States government for sending troops to suppress the riot and for providing various conveniences to the Chinese consuls who went to investigate. He then summarized the facts obtained from the investigation into the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese nationals were killed, and there was no provocative behavior on the part of the Chinese nationals that caused the riot.</p>
<p>(2) The riot occurred during the day. The local authorities neither stopped it nor suppressed it. They only conducted an interrogation once after the incident, and the interrogation was conducted in a manner that was almost comical.</p>
<p>(3) According to the consul's report, none of the rioters had been punished by the local authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore, Minister Zheng Zhaoru, on behalf of the Chinese government, made the following demands to the United States government:</p>
<p>(1) Punish the criminals.</p>
<p>(2) Compensate the Chinese nationals for the damages they suffered.</p>
<p>(3) The United States government should take effective measures to protect Chinese nationals and prevent similar riots from occurring again in Rock Springs and other places.</p>
<p>Before the Rock Springs incident, Chinese people residing in California, Alaska, Montana, and Washington had all been subjected to mob violence. At that time, Chinese representatives made representations to the United States government, but the United States replied with the excuse that the United States' political organization was a federal system and that the federal government could not interfere in the administrative actions of local governments. After the Rock Springs case occurred, the Chinese Minister immediately refuted the above excuse, stating that since the riot occurred within the borders of the United States, the federal government could not shirk its responsibility. Sometimes, the United States government cited international law and international etiquette as a basis for its arguments. The Chinese Minister then abandoned the broad principles of international law and based his response solely on the point of international comity, making the following reply:</p>
<p>According to the Sino-American Treaty of 1858, the legal protection enjoyed by American nationals residing in China is no different from the legal protection received by Chinese nationals residing in the United States. Article 11 of the same treaty stipulates that the Chinese local government provides legal protection to American nationals, which is not a reciprocal clause. However, I "the Chinese Minister" do not understand why Your Excellency, the Secretary of State, would therefore say that the American local government does not bear the same responsibility to Chinese nationals. Furthermore, do not Article 6 of the Sino-American Treaty of 1868 and Article 2 of the Sino-American Treaty of 1880 stipulate that Chinese people residing in the United States receive the treatment of the most favored nation? This will not be discussed in detail for now. To further illustrate, before 1858, there were many cases in which the losses suffered by American nationals residing in China due to robbery and riots were compensated by the Chinese provincial government or local authorities after representations were made by American representatives. In 1858, China and the United States concluded an agreement in which the Chinese government paid the United States 735,258.97 yuan in one lump sum to settle all compensation claims from American nationals. This amount exceeded the amount requested by the American nationals, and the United States government subsequently returned the excess amount to China. Since 1858, American diplomats stationed in China have regarded this responsibility borne by China to foreigners as a customary practice. Whenever American nationals suffered damage to their lives and properties due to riots and looting, they would, upon receiving instructions from the American government, make representations to the Chinese authorities or local governments, demanding not only compensation for damages but also punishment of the criminals. A review of such files reveals that the Chinese authorities ordered local governments to rebuild the destroyed houses of American nationals, and ordered local governments to compensate American nationals for the stolen petty items, even when the thieves could not be caught.

<h3>Wang Chonghui Meets with the Press Yesterday, Discussing Sino-Japanese Negotiations, Demanding Negotiations with President Chiang, Stating that There Is No Proportionality Among Countries</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Executive Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. At 10:00 AM yesterday, at his private residence on Masnan Road, at the request of journalists, he expressed his observations on the international situation. Wang stated that the current situation in Europe is extremely complex, and the eyes of the whole world are focused on the situation in East Asia. Therefore, Wang's discussion was limited to the Sino-Japanese issue. However, Wang stated that his understanding of the progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations has only come from reports in newspapers and on the radio. He does not know what the truth is and feels quite removed. For example, the contents of the conditions proposed by both China and Japan as reported in the newspapers recently are quite different from the facts. Wang visited Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and the members of the Central Executive Committee in Shanghai yesterday (the 4th) to inquire about everything. Before the truth is clearly understood, he is unwilling to express much. According to Wang, the current tense relationship between China and Japan is an undeniable fact. The Sino-Japanese negotiations have reached a final juncture. Judging from Japan's active preparations, it can be known that the situation of procrastination cannot be prolonged for a moment. We do not want to speculate on the future with illusions. I believe that if both countries have the sincerity to resolve the issue peacefully, then any difficult problem can be resolved peacefully through diplomatic channels. Even if a fundamental solution cannot be reached, a temporary compromise can be sought. Have not all the various serious problems that have occurred in the past between Germany and Poland been resolved peacefully through diplomatic channels? As for why Japan is demanding to start negotiations directly with President Chiang, I do not know the reasons. However, although the powers of the foreign ministers of various countries may vary depending on their political systems, I have not heard of any precedent of bypassing the foreign minister and demanding to negotiate directly with someone else. I agree with the joint opinions and beliefs expressed by the press in Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Wuhan on the 3rd in general. If the feelings between China and Japan are not improved, then the normal state of diplomatic relations between the two countries cannot be restored, negotiations cannot proceed, and outstanding issues cannot be resolved. I hope that the Japanese side will first investigate the causes and truths of the unfortunate incidents that have occurred in Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Wuhan, and then investigate the issue of responsibility. Japan is demanding economic cooperation with our country. There are precedents for this in European and American countries, such as the tariff agreements that France has concluded with various countries, totaling more than 100. However, all are based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Japan's demand for economic cooperation with our country depends on the scope of its demands. Before Japan has proposed a concrete plan, I am unwilling to criticize it. I plan to stay in Shanghai for a few days and then go to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday: All Circles in This City Actively Prepare for Celebrations on October 29th</h3>
<p>According to the Sin Sin News Agency, October 29th is the birthday of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission. This year marks his 50th birthday. All circles in this city consider Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as the sole leader of our country's revolution. From following the Prime Minister to vowing to launch the Northern Expedition, he successively laid the foundation of the country and quelled banditry. His great achievements are admired by the whole country. On the occasion of his 50th birthday celebration, in order to commemorate his achievements, they initiated the purchase of airplanes as a birthday gift. Now that the deadline is approaching, they are actively preparing to present the airplanes and offer their congratulations at that time. At the same time, party and government organs and various groups are also starting to prepare for major celebrations to express their utmost respect for the leader.</p>
<p>Donations for Purchasing Airplanes from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's fundraising for airplane purchases to present to the government as a memorial for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday has seen enthusiastic donations from all parties. The Grains, Oil, and Cake Trade Association donated 90,000 yuan by levying a tax on goods to support the purchase of airplanes for birthday greetings, and the process has been going smoothly since its commencement. Yesterday, they already paid 20,000 yuan of the received donations to the Airplane Purchase Memorial Association for counting. Additionally, the Shanghai Jinshi Public Association donated 5,000 yuan, Zhang Jingjiang 200 yuan, He Dekui Wang Hailin, Fufeng Flour Mill, Sincere Company, Liu Wuzhai, Chuan Zai Gao, Tonghe Bank, Chen Peide, Hu Junzhuang, Lin Wenguang, and Jingjiang Public Association each donated 100 yuan, Li Shizeng 200 yuan, Xincheng Company 50 yuan, Hubei Fellow Villagers Association 200 yuan, Guohua Coal Ball Factory Shao Yanshan, Fu'an Co., Ltd., and Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company each donated 50 yuan, Ren Yu Kang Ji Knitting Factory 107 yuan and 76 cents, Wanxing Food Shop 113 yuan and 60 cents, Daozhong Girls' Middle School 54 yuan and 80 cents, and Dingcheng Leather Shop raised 20 yuan, including 5 yuan from colleagues in the shop, 5 yuan from six-year-old Chen Zhiliang, 5 yuan from Ms. Liu Jingwen, and 5 yuan from Chen Gengyuan.

<p>National Temples Celebrate</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association in this city, in order to celebrate Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, specially issued a notice to Buddhist organizations and temples across the country, stating, "This year, October 29th, we respectfully celebrate Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, with everyone singing his praises, admiring the radiance of the sun and moon, and jointly wishing him longevity and health. We believe that the Generalissimo is loyal to the party and the country, takes on difficult and dangerous tasks, revives the country despite many difficulties, and establishes the country with the four cardinal principles. His achievements are high in this era and his grace benefits all the people. As he reaches the age of assuming political responsibility, on the day of unified completion, all of us Buddhists should admire and comfort the leader of the nation, and jointly express our sincere support. It has been decided by this council that all Buddhist organizations and temples across the country should hold celebration ceremonies on the day of his birthday, chanting the mantra of dispelling disasters and prolonging life, and the true name of the Buddha of Brightness, praying that the Generalissimo's blessings and virtues will increase daily, and that his meritorious deeds will always be remembered, leading the people to a realm of benevolence and longevity, and establishing the foundation of the country's stability. In addition to instructing each branch to inform them, this notice is hereby issued, and all Buddhist organizations and temples across the country are required to comply."</p>
<h3>Gu Xin-yi Talks: Shanghai Has 1 Million Shi of Rice in Storage, Sources Are Plentiful, and There Is No Worry About People's Food</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Gu Xin-yi, a leading figure in the grain industry, yesterday. He mentioned that this year's rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi have all reported bumper harvests due to favorable weather conditions. The new grains entering the market have increased by 30% compared to last year. Therefore, this year's harvest is sufficient for self-sufficiency. As for the planned foreign rice, it has all arrived, and there is no need to order more. In the Shanghai area alone, there are 1 million shi of rice in storage, of which new rice accounts for about 70% and old rice 30%. Currently, there is still a large amount of grain stored in various places. Because of the bumper harvest in the producing areas, the merchant guilds have all suspended their orders for foreign rice. In short, it is hoped that foreign rice imports will disappear this year. The sources in the surrounding areas are still abundant, and the future of the people's food supply is worry-free.</p>
<h3>The Ministries of Finance and Industry Pay Attention: Low Grain Prices Hurt Farmers</h3>
<p>Handling Grain Transportation and Sales, Building Warehouses</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministries of Finance and Industry, in view of the abundant agricultural production in various places this year, and the tendency of supply exceeding demand in rice-producing areas, are deeply concerned about creating a situation where low grain prices hurt farmers. They have jointly handled grain transportation and sales to regulate the people's food supply. The two ministries have now detailed transportation measures for this organization and are preparing to contact grain associations and other organizations across the country. They also stated that the banking industry should provide as much assistance as possible, and the Central Trust Bureau will manage all affairs. Transportation agencies will be established in rice-producing areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. Farmers' cooperatives in various places will also organize shipping transportation cooperatives to implement division of labor and cooperation to facilitate production and sales transportation.</p>
<p>Our country's agricultural rice production is sufficient for self-sufficiency, but in the last ten years, rice-producing areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei have been plagued by natural and man-made disasters. The amount of rice produced is not enough to meet 30-40% of the national consumption, resulting in tens of millions of yuan of foreign rice imports each year. The rural economy has therefore been severely threatened. This year, due to favorable rainfall, agricultural production in various places has been very good, and the yield is expected to increase by 50-60% compared to previous years, which is sufficient to meet the national demand and even have a surplus. In order to avoid overproduction and causing low prices, the authorities are now handling grain transportation and sales, adjusting evenly. They have also requested the banking industry to assist the provincial governments in building warehouses to implement a grain storage system for disaster prevention and to meet emergency needs. Currently, the Construction Departments and Agricultural Product Management Offices of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces are contacting the banking industry for loans to proceed with the implementation in order. The future progress is quite smooth.</p>
<h3>County Farmers' Association Petitions for Review of Rental Prices</h3>
<p>According to Nongcun News Agency, the farmland owners in the first district of Shanghai County, considering this year's autumn harvest to be relatively abundant, agreed on a cotton field rental price of 6.72 yuan per mu and notified the tenants to pay according to the amount. However, the tenants believed that this price was far too high compared to last year and that they had suffered greatly from years of famine and could not afford it. Therefore, they petitioned the local farmers' association for relief. The county farmers' association repeatedly received reports and believed that the situation was true and that the landlords had only relied on their own opinions when setting the land price and had not allowed the tenants to participate in the agreement, which was biased and unfair. They specially submitted a petition to the Shanghai County Government and the County Party Department, requesting that the district be ordered to send a letter to the landlords to re-measure the land on a scheduled basis and allow the association to send representatives to attend and participate in the discussion in order to protect the interests of the tenants. The text of their petition to the County Government is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) It is now reported by the Farmers' Association of the First Township of the First District, "The cotton rent in this district this year has been agreed upon by the landlords, with a rent price of 5.6 yuan per dan, which is equivalent to a rent price of 6.72 yuan per mu. Although this year's harvest is more abundant than in previous years, it is only slightly different from the overall situation of rent collection in previous years, but this year's rent price is quite different from last year's 3.8 yuan per dan, which is equivalent to 4.56 yuan. Such an increase imposed on the tenants is extremely alarming. The tenants will have countermeasures to deal with it. We dare to request your association to strive to reduce the rent price in the shortest possible time until the goal is achieved in order to alleviate the burden on the tenants." After investigating this year's autumn harvest, although it is more abundant than in previous years, the agreed rent price based on the landlord's one-sided view is unfair. We dare to petition your honor to sympathize with the tenants' injuries over the years and provide relief, and to quickly order the head of the first district to send letters to the landlords to re-negotiate the rent price on a scheduled basis. At the same time, we request to know the date of the renegotiation so that the association can send representatives to attend and contribute the tenants' opinions in order to achieve the result of cooperation between the landlords and tenants. We will be grateful if the government approves. Sincerely presented by Li, the County Magistrate of Shanghai County. The text of the petition to the County Party Department is slightly similar.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Industry Opposes Unified Control: General Assembly to Be Held Soon</h3>
<p>Discussing Countermeasures, Deciding to Petition the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Tobacco Trade Association of this city, due to the Ministry of Finance's plan to jointly establish a trading organization with tobacco merchants to implement unified control over tobacco, has successively requested the Tax Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to make changes to benefit the tobacco industry and commerce. However, it has not been approved for many days. For this reason, the association has decided to convene a general meeting of members within a specified time to discuss countermeasures. After the meeting, it will decide to petition the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Pattani, Siam, Return to China for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Zeng Fushun and Wu Bacui, leaders of overseas Chinese from Pattani, Siam, have been engaged in rubber, tin mining, and remittance businesses overseas for many years. Recently, they have come to deeply understand the rapid progress of the motherland's construction. Wu has not returned to his hometown to visit his ancestral graves for twenty years. Zeng, along with his wife, Ms. Lin, and his son, Wanshou, have been overseas Chinese in Siam for five generations and have never returned to their homeland. Their longing and admiration have been for a long time. They departed from Siam on August 21st, passing through Penang, Singapore, and Little Luzon. They met their old friend, Zeng Weiqing, in Hong Kong, who was responsible for the documentation during the trip. After arriving in Shanghai, they immediately went to Nanjing to report to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission on the progress of restoring the Zhonghua School. Chairman Chen expressed his appreciation, and informed them of the recent attention paid by people from all walks of life to the overseas Chinese in Siam, as well as the details of the process. Deputy Chairman Zhou and Chen Chunpu, Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department, also treated them with great courtesy and sincerely instructed them. After completing their public duties, they went north to Beijing and Tianjin, and then to Qingdao for sightseeing. Everywhere they went, they were deeply impressed by the political, educational, and cultural construction of the motherland, and they praised it endlessly, saying that it was beyond their expectations. They were infinitely delighted and infinitely inspired. Only because Zeng's son, Wanshou, was about to return to the University of Hong Kong to resume his studies, he could not stay for long. Yesterday morning, he passed through Shanghai from Nanjing, and after going to Hangzhou to watch the tide, he went to Hong Kong and his hometown in Xiamen, and then traveled to Annam before returning to Siam.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Schedules a Lecture on His Trip to Siam</h3>

He organized a report and submitted it to the National Government. It is understood that Lin has accepted the invitation of the Youth Association and will give a lecture at 5:30 PM on the 7th of this month (Wednesday) in the auditorium of the association, entitled "The Experience of Investigating Siam".</p>
<h3>Italian Embassy Secretary Mr. Li Sao Returns Home Today</h3>

<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Carrying New Instructions from Japan, Kuwashima is Expected to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Kuwashima Shukei, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was ordered by Japan to come to China on the Nagasaki Maru, carrying new instructions from the meeting of the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy to Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru in China. The estimated arrival time is 3 PM today. The ship will dock at the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf. At that time, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy and Consul-General in Shanghai, Wakasugi, as well as military attachés from the Army and Navy, will go to welcome him. According to an informal announcement from the Japanese Embassy yesterday, Kuwashima will first hold a meeting with the Army Attaché Kita and the Navy Attaché Sato to show them the contents of the new instructions and listen to their reports and opinions. Then, he will fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning to meet Kawagoe and convey everything.</p>
<h3>Measures for Dismissing Temporary Workers Explained by the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>For Those Who Have Worked for More Than Three Months, Dismissal Should Be Notified Ten Days in Advance</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to explain the measures for dismissing temporary workers, saying, "According to the report of the Shanghai Tenth District Cotton Spinning Industry Workers' Union on June 23, 25th year of the Republic, the Shanghai Shenxin First Textile Factory has recently hired workers and given them temporary worker cards. Even if they have been working in the factory for more than three consecutive months, they are still regarded as temporary workers and arbitrarily dismissed, causing repeated disputes. Is it applicable to Articles 27 and 29 of the Factory Law? Please explain, etc. After arriving at the Ministry, it was found that the temporary worker cards issued by the Shanghai Shenxin First Textile Factory have no fixed term. If workers continue to work in the factory for more than three months, they can follow the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan Yuanzi No. 1155. If it is an oral contract with no fixed term, then Article 27 of the Factory Law shall apply. Based on the previous report, in addition to the approval, a copy of the original report shall be attached and sent to the bureau for compliance. This order, attached with the original report, is as follows: It is requested to provide instructions for compliance. The Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory, a member of this association, has recently hired workers and given them temporary worker cards. Even if they have been working in the factory for more than three consecutive months, they are still regarded as temporary workers and arbitrarily dismissed, causing repeated disputes. The Factory Law does not have explicit regulations regarding the working hours of temporary workers, but according to the provisions of Article 27, paragraph 1 of the Factory Law, if workers have been working in the factory for more than three months but less than one year, they should be given a ten-day notice period when dismissed. And according to the second half of Article 29 of the same law, if the contract is terminated immediately without complying with the provisions of Article 27, the workers must be paid the wages for the notice period stipulated in that article. Is it also applicable to temporary workers who have been working in the factory for more than three consecutive months when they are dismissed? This is a doubtful issue. The association submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for interpretation on April 14, but has not yet received instructions, and does not know what to do. Therefore, it is specially requested that your ministry grant an interpretation for public convenience."</p>
<h3>The China Aviation Association Has Been Completely Dissolved and Cleared</h3>
<p>After the China Aviation Association was ordered to merge, on the 1st of this month, the newly organized China Aviation Construction Association sent personnel to Shanghai to take over. Personnel from the Military and Financial Ministries of the Executive Yuan were sent to supervise the handover. The handover and receipt have been completed separately.

The Aviation Bi-Monthly Publication and the China Flying Club will continue to operate, but will be under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing China Aviation Construction Association. The donation for purchasing airplanes for birthday greetings, in addition to the one million yuan previously handed over, has a remaining cash balance of 296,468.86 yuan, which will be handed over to the reception committee and transferred to the Nanjing Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Airplane Donation Memorial Committee. From now on, all matters handled by the China Aviation Association will be taken over by the Nanjing New Aviation Construction Association.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Officially Announces the Postponement of Collection of Deposit Interest Income Tax: Postponed Until New Year's Day Next Year</h3>
<p>In addition to issuing separate orders to the banking and money industries' associations for compliance, the Ministry of Finance hereby issues Announcement No. 168 to inform the public that the collection of deposit interest income tax has been postponed. The announcement states, "The date of commencement of the deposit interest income tax has been announced in the record. It is now reported by the local banking and money industries' associations that the withholding procedures are particularly complicated and the time is pressing. The branches in various places have been unable to prepare uniformly and on schedule. They sincerely request that the commencement date be postponed, etc. After verification, the report is found to be true. In order to consider the difficulties, it is tentatively approved to postpone the deposit interest income tax until January 1, 26th year of the Republic. In addition to issuing instructions and submitting a report to the National Government for verification and filing, this announcement is hereby issued. Minister Kong Xiangxi."</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables Various Chambers of Commerce: Delivery Notes Should Be Stamped</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce in this city yesterday cabled the Federations of Chambers of Commerce in various provinces and the Chambers of Commerce throughout the country, saying, "We have recently received the Finance Ministry's Tax Character No. 10658 telegraphic message, which states that the documents and ledgers for the withdrawal of goods that should be stamped according to Item 5 of the Stamp Tax Rate Table originally stipulated in the nature column of the item 'All documents, whether registered or unregistered, issued by shops of various trades to withdraw goods are included.' The so-called 'such as item coupons, laundry tickets, and goods withdrawal booklets' mentioned in the remarks column are examples of the item and other vouchers that are not listed but have the same nature should still be stamped according to the tax rate of the item. This is also clearly stipulated in Article 9 of the Implementation Rules. The single sheet used by Store A to withdraw goods from Store B is the same as the situation where Store B uses a goods withdrawal booklet for goods withdrawal and payment recording, since Store B uses it for accounting and goods payment. It naturally belongs to the nature of documents for the withdrawal of goods and should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Item 5 of the Tax Rate Table. Moreover, Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that the vouchers subject to stamp tax should be stamped with stamp tickets before delivery or use. This goods withdrawal sheet has already produced the effect of a voucher when it is delivered to the other party, and it should naturally be stamped before delivery. As for the situation where the other party occasionally fails to deliver the goods according to the sheet, it is another problem and does not invalidate the goods withdrawal sheet itself. If it is said that under this circumstance, this goods withdrawal sheet fails to take effect and should not be stamped, then why should there be a reason to stamp it afterwards if the goods withdrawn are delivered according to the sheet? The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce have separately requested that this goods purchase car be exempted from stamping, and all have been rejected on file. Although the tax-free column of Item 5 of the Tax Rate Table stipulates 'Documents less than three yuan are exempt from stamping,' the second half of Article 17 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates, 'If the amount is not specified, the stamp tax should be stamped at the highest tax rate of the original type.' Therefore, if this goods purchase sheet does not have the price of the goods specified, it should still be stamped with two cents of stamp tax in accordance with the law. Please be informed accordingly. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Former Iranian Consul-General in Shanghai, Osto-Mowen, Returns Home</h3>
<p>Departing from Shanghai by Ship Today with His Family</p>
<p>After the new Iranian Consul-General in Shanghai, Maisender Raiski, took office last month, he also served as the diplomatic representative of the country in China. He once went to Nanjing to pay a visit to our foreign affairs authorities. The former Consul-General in Shanghai, Osto-Mowen, has been recalled to his country to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the information from the consulate on Jing'an Temple Road, Mr. Osto is scheduled to take the Kermoran of the Henry Bao Company with his family today and leave China, taking the route of Mumbai, India, to return to his country for duty.</p>
<h3>Poor Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Leads to Suspension of Silk Trading</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the silk manufacturers who have been registered and approved by the silk control organizations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have borrowed money from the banking and money industries since the autumn cocoons came on the market to start purchasing. However, due to the poor autumn cocoon harvest in various places, the cocoon prices have increased. At the same time, because the reeling is inferior to the spring cocoons, the cocoons obtained will inevitably result in losses. The cocoon shops in various places have successively stopped weighing. The cocoons obtained by the silk factories in Shanghai have been transported in batches by trucks to Shanghai and piled up in the warehouses of various banks. At the same time, they are mortgaging to the banks to borrow money.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Silk Trading Is Quiet</p>
<p>Hua silk's foreign trade has been sharply reduced and prices have plummeted since being affected by the dumping of Japanese silk. The B-grade standard silk has now fallen to 600 yuan per dan in national currency, and there are no transactions. At the same time, silk manufacturers are unwilling to sell due to the low prices. As for domestic silk factory users, the price per dan is 20-30 yuan higher than the foreign market price, but due to the current situation, silk factories have temporarily stopped purchasing, leading to quiet trading.</p>
<p>Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are in Danger of Suspension</p>
<p>There are a total of 100 silk factories in Wuxi in Jiangsu, and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Haining, and Shanghai in Zhejiang. Since Hua silk's foreign trade has been sharply reduced, the reeled silk will inevitably be piled up in warehouses. Now that domestic trade has also stopped, the piled silk has no buyers, so there is a tendency for suspension of work. In Shanghai alone, there were originally 48 factories in operation. It is expected that several factories will suspend operations due to the accumulation of inventory and the lack of transactions. Therefore, the future of the silk industry is very pessimistic.</p>
<p>Prices Are Too High, Petitioning for Relief</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, this year's autumn silkworms in Jiangsu Province have failed to fully develop due to the bad weather, resulting in a sharp decline in the harvest and poor silkworm quality. In addition, the prices of export silk have been falling, and silk cocoon manufacturers do not dare to purchase as much as possible. The silk farmers have suffered losses. It is learned from the silk industry that silk cocoon merchants have stored [incomplete] However, the reason is that they are afraid of losses due to the poor foreign sales. They have expressed dissatisfaction with the prices set for the autumn [incomplete]. The National Economic Commission's Sericulture Improvement Association stipulates 29 yuan as the balanced standard price, while the provincial government stipulates 29 yuan as the minimum price, which leaves the silk cocoon manufacturers at a loss. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Cocoon Trade Association Joint Association, the Wuxi Cocoon Trade Association, and the Silk Factory Trade Association have jointly petitioned the provincial government and the Sericulture Improvement Association in order to preserve the lifeline of the silkworm farmers and silk merchants in Jiangsu Province, calling for relief.</p>
<h3>Petition Approved for Allocation of Funds to Repair the Seawall</h3>
<p>According to Nongcun News Agency, the seawall in Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, has been repeatedly affected by wind and waves in recent years, and has been breached and destroyed several times. Fortunately, it has been inspected and repaired to avoid a major disaster. However, on the 3rd of last month, the wing wall inside the North Stone Cave of the seawall in the county was completely destroyed due to the passage of a hurricane, and the concrete wall of the North Wang Temple was also collapsed, reaching 158 meters, and the bottom feet were empty and tilted outward, making the situation very dangerous. County Magistrate Zhang Mingjing once reported to the provincial government and supervised the emergency repair work. However, because the seawall project there is of great importance, any negligence would not only affect the lives and fields of the people along the seawall, but also threaten the safety of the neighboring Susong counties and Shanghai. He has again submitted to the province, requesting the prompt allocation of funds to carry out permanent projects to prevent future accidents. It is heard that after receiving the report, the provincial government also believes that what he sees is correct, and is planning to allocate funds for construction to ensure the safety.</p>
<h3>Ma Liang, Special Commissioner for Anti-Smoking in Jiangsu and Shanghai, Will Go to Zhenjiang Today</h3>
<p>Ma Liang, the Special Commissioner for Anti-Smoking in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, is scheduled to go to Zhenjiang today to discuss reporting matters with Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is expected that he will stay in Zhenjiang for two or three days before going to Nanjing to report back.</p>
<h3>Scrap Cotton Exports Surge</h3>
<p>More Than 300,000 Yuan Exported Daily</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, due to various reasons in this city recently, scrap cotton exports have surged. This waste material is the remaining cotton waste from the yarn factories. The Jianghai Customs once prohibited exports, but the Ministry of Finance has since lifted the ban. Recently, Japan has been buying heavily, so the amount transported and exported daily has reached more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals from Three Countries Do Not Pay Income Tax</h3>
<p>Reuters News Agency, Shanghai Branch: According to a dispatch from Nanjing, the Norwegian authorities here issued a statement to Reuters today, denying the rumor that the Norwegian government has decided that its citizens in China should pay income tax to the Chinese government. In addition, the Swiss Consul-General and Acting Chargé d'Affaires declared that he had never heard of the rumor that Swiss citizens in China would also have to pay income tax, and had not delivered any note on the matter to the Chinese government. The Dutch consular authorities also issued a similar denial.</p>

<h3>Bear Sisters' American Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a preview reception for the works of the Bear sisters, Bi Shuang, Yao Shuang, and Pei Shuang, who were sent abroad by the Ministry of Education for observation, was held at the Great World Company. The exhibition will be open to the public from today until the 12th on the fourth floor of the Great World Company. Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., a reception was held for various sectors, including Li Dachao, Huang Jingwan, and dozens of journalists. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The venue is located in five rooms in the west of the fourth floor of the Great World Company. A colorful archway is erected at the entrance, with a horizontal plaque inscribed with "Guang Yao Jin Yu" (Shining Like Jade) by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The walls of the room are hung with large and small paintings, horizontal scrolls, and fan surfaces, amounting to no fewer than several dozen pieces. These are all elegant works by the Bear sisters, mostly depicting birds and flowers. Handwritten letters were also placed on the table, including miniature versions of various books and inscriptions by Chairman Lin, Wang Shijie, Wang Jingwei, etc., showing the high praise the Bear sisters received from various quarters.</p>
<p>Bear Bi Shuang's Speech: At the reception, Li Dachao first gave a brief introductory speech, followed by Ms. Xiong Bi Shuang, who gave a speech in Cantonese, saying, "Before the Ministry of Education sent us abroad to observe art, we were able to hold a preview exhibition of our humble works in China, initiated by President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, and Mayor Wu. We held it first in the capital, and we are very grateful for the praise from all sectors. Now, we are exhibiting in Shanghai, and we are very honored to have you all here. We hope you will give us your guidance." Subsequently, Huang Jingwan delivered a speech (omitted). The reception ended with refreshments.</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others' Remarks: Written introductions from President Sun of the Legislative Yuan and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, and fourteen others, stated, "The three sisters from Lingnan, Xiong Bi Shuang, Yao Shuang, and Pei Shuang, share the same ambition, studied at Guangzhou Zhixin School together, graduated from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Hong Kong, and have been devoted to painting for ten years as if it were one day. Their works inherit the essence of Nantian, and they also privately learned from the elder Mr. Ju Ginquan, a fellow villager, and received guidance from Mr. Gao Qifeng. Therefore, their achievements are exquisite and perfect. Last year, they brought five or six hundred outstanding works to Beijing for exhibition and painted on the spot. They showed their talent and artistry, not only making a beautiful story of sisters, but also adding color to the art world. Chinese and foreign newspapers have published special issues, praising them as outstanding young women in the history of Oriental painting. Recently, they were sent abroad by the Ministry of Education to observe European and American art, and they have ambitions to deepen their artistic skills at a young age, which is commendable. The Xiong sisters are willing to carry seven or eight hundred works with them for exhibition, to promote national glory. Now, on their way abroad, they come to Shanghai, and are welcomed by all sectors, making a short stay, and displaying their works to the people of this city. There will also be impromptu painting at the venue, which will surely attract elegance. Therefore, we write a few words to introduce them to those who are interested in art."</p>

<h3>Disguised Traitors Discovered in Neighboring Counties of This City</h3>
<p>Five More Arrested in Taicang; Secret Codes Seized</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that, due to the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese issue, rumors have been rampant, causing public unrest. Some traitors have been exploited and have been active in disguise in neighboring counties from time to time. Last month, beggar Wang Si and monk Cheng He were arrested in Dachang Town on the Shanghai-Taicang Road. After investigation by the Baoshan County Government, it was confirmed that they were being exploited and were willing to act as traitors. The Jiangsu Province Third District Security Command has investigated and severely punished them. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Sixth District Office of Shuangfeng Town in Taicang County received a confidential report stating that five disguised monks had come to the town for several days and their actions were suspicious, so they were asked to pay attention to them. The District Office immediately dispatched district officers to investigate Zhou Shu Town, at the border of Kunshan and Taicang counties. At Shanchuan Bay, they saw the five monks wandering around, focusing on surveying work. The district officers went forward to arrest them. After strict interrogation, their speech was evasive. Upon searching their bodies, they found a piece of black cloth sewn onto the sleeves of the five monks' clothes, with secret codes on it, and a white gauze thread around their necks. The district officers believed that they were highly suspected of acting as spies, so they arrested them all and sent them to the Taicang County Government for interrogation. It is understood that some parties are disguised as investigators to investigate our country's national defense construction and troop movements. They often use heavy money to exploit the low-level vagrants in our country and send them to neighboring counties of Shanghai to act as spies. The Jiangsu Province Security Command, the Songhu Garrison Command, and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau have learned of their actions, so they have ordered strict attention. At the same time, the county governments of Baoshan, Taicang, Jiading, Shanghai, Jinshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian have also established contact and are stepping up prevention.</p>
<h3>Hongkou and Zhabei Peaceful Yesterday; No More Japanese Posts South of Route des Sœurs</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the Japanese military posts south of Route des Sœurs and at Xintong Road, Xiangyan Bridge, and other locations in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas were completely removed the day before yesterday, the situation was even more peaceful yesterday. There were no more Japanese posts at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Route des Sœurs. However, the intersections north of the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qijiang Road and on various roads such as Wusong Road and Haining Road have not yet been removed. This is based on the situation in Hongkou. In Zhabei, Japanese troops had dispatched posts several times at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road the day before yesterday, but they did not dispatch any posts at all yesterday. The Japanese side claimed to be protecting overseas Chinese. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and since no students were going out, there was no need to do so. Yesterday, Sigao Road, Ouyang Road, Xiangde Road, Sida Road, Qimei Road, Old Xiangyan Bridge Road, Xiangyan Road, Tiantong Road, Tiantong Road Bridge, Qijiang Road, and other places were very peaceful. However, around 4:00 p.m., there were a few Japanese posts at the intersection of Dixiwei Road and Tiantong Road, and at the intersection of Oujia Road, as well as in the Oujia Road Bridge area. However, residents were already accustomed to it and were not very panicked. The trend of relocation has also greatly decreased.

<h3>Two Ships Collide in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning; Both Suffer Minor Damage</h3>
<p>Huangpu Wheel and Luoyang Maru</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Japanese Nissin Company's Luoyang Maru loaded passengers and cargo at the Pudong Wharf in Nanshi at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday and set sail for Hankou. At 9:15 a.m., when it sailed to the vicinity of the Bund Park at the mouth of the Suzhou Creek in the Huangpu River, the Taikoo Company's Huangpu Wheel, which was also coming from Hankou (the ship entered the Wusongkou at 7:55 a.m.), was coming head-on. Unable to avoid each other, the distance was already close. Both pulled the whistle and reversed backwards. However, the Huangpu Wheel was close to the Bund Park side, making it difficult to turn. The ship's port side and the Luoyang Maru's port side collided with each other. The lower cabin's door was damaged. The iron bar under the Luoyang Maru's port side door was broken and penetrated into the Huangpu Wheel. After the two ships collided, because the damage to both sides was light, the Huangpu Wheel continued to sail to the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong to load and unload passengers and cargo. The Luoyang Maru docked briefly at the wharf and then left the port as usual, sailing to Hankou.</p>
<h3>County Government Proclamation: Opportunity for Drug Offenders to Reform</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the province, which states that from January 1, 1937, in addition to those who manufacture, transport, or sell drugs, who will still be sentenced to death, first-time offenders who inject morphine or use drugs, who were originally only subject to imprisonment, will also be sentenced to death. It is regrettable that those who are willing to step into the legal net, but it is unbearable to let ignorant people suffer the extreme penalty. In order to show mercy outside the law, a final opportunity for reform is given. All first-time offenders who inject morphine or use drugs who reform before the end of this year and surrender to the county government will be exempted from criminal punishment and sent for medical treatment. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to widely publicizing it with the Anti-Smoking Committee, also issued a public announcement yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yu Kunsheng, Official of the Travel Agency Association, Extorted Money</h3>
<p>Fined Twenty Dollars</p>
<p>On October 26, the Laodexing Inn, located at No. 155 Maigaobaolu Road, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, was reported to the French Concession Police for a monetary dispute with a guest. The landlady, Ding Zhou, was summoned for questioning. The inn reported to the French Concession Office of the Shanghai Travel Agency Association, and Yu Kunsheng (43 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 23 Guianli, Geluoke Road), an official of the association, rushed to the police station to inquire. Yu told Ding Zhou that she needed to pay 15 yuan for "expenses" to avoid being detained and prosecuted. Zhou believed him and paid the money. However, after interrogation by the head of the police, Ding Zhou was ordered to pay a fine of one dollar as a warning. Afterwards, Ding Zhou's husband, Ding Ahai (57 years old, from Ningbo), the owner of the Dexing Inn, believed that since the matter had been mediated by Yu Kunsheng, an official of the association, and he had spent 15 yuan, why was he still fined? He was dissatisfied with Yu's fraudulent behavior and reported it to the French Concession Police. The police investigated and confirmed the facts and sent Yu to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of obtaining property by fraud. Judge Qiu Huanhuan questioned the plaintiff, Ahai, and his wife, Ding Zhou, who testified about the fraud. The defendant, Yu Kunsheng, denied defrauding Zhou, claiming that he had collected a membership fee of 15 yuan from the inn. The plaintiff also stated that the inn did not owe any membership fees. Then, Ren Asan (40 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 22 Diandang Street), the director of the French Concession Office of the Travel Agency Association, came to court to testify for Yu, stating that he had indeed sent Yu to collect membership fees from the Laodexing Inn that day. The court questioned the witness based on the plaintiff's claim that he did not owe any membership fees. Even if he was collecting membership fees, there was no reason to pay more than the amount due, which was obviously a fraud. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court declared the debate closed and sentenced Yu Kunsheng to a fine of 20 yuan for obtaining the property of another person by fraud. If he was to perform labor service instead, it would be calculated at 1 yuan per day.</p>

According to Weng Wenying's statement, she is twenty-six years old and lives at No. 8 Mao Hai Road. When my husband was teaching in Ma'bu, he remitted a total of 1,300 yuan to the defendant, which he has now embezzled, so I am suing him. She also submitted multiple copies of remittances and letters as proof. When questioned, Zhou Huiyi stated, It is true that my late brother remitted money to me, but this money was for my father. Because my father did not understand English, he asked me to receive it on his behalf. There are accounts to check, and he submitted multiple letters. After Judge Pan verified the statements, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for a hearing.</p>

Taking advantage of the name to manipulate the association affairs, not only are they failing the expectations of the city's industry, but they are also violating the regulations of the industry association. Therefore, they jointly filed a petition, asking the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to revoke the license, order the dissolution, and have the true industry organize according to the law, so as to comply with the law and protect their interests. Here is an excerpt of the original petition: Presented to the authorities for outsiders to destroy regulations, organize industry associations, obtain permission, obviously use the name to manipulate association affairs, and request a thorough investigation according to law, order the dissolution, and let the true industry initiate the organization to comply with the law and protect their interests. We merchants have established leather factories in this city for many years, and deeply feel that the city's industry is like a plate of loose sand, losing legal interests. Recently, we received Shanghai Leather Industry Association No. 5 notice, limited to seven days, in accordance with the regulations to join the association, otherwise will be sanctioned according to law, etc. To investigate the organization of the association, there are endless regrets. In order to maintain the law, for the benefit of the industry, we carefully list the illegal points of the association as follows: (1) Shanghai Leather Industry Association, the person who applied for the organization is Chen Jiufeng. Liu Zhongying, etc., and according to the membership list of the association, Chen Jiufeng is the representative of Erwo Leather Glove Company, Liu Zhongying is the representative of Zhangji Leather Factory, although Erwo Leather Glove Company has been a flash in the pan, but closed to date, for more than two years, Zhangji Leather Factory, since the opening of the city, there is no such factory name, enough to prove that claiming to be the industry, begging for organization, this is also one of the illegal acts of the association, (2) The association was approved for permission on May 21, 1934, according to Article 5 of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Group Registration Regulations, and Article 8 of the filing procedure, it should be fully organized within three months, announce the establishment, but the association, just held its founding conference on June 10 this year, the time from the Party Department's approval has exceeded two years, obviously lost the statutory time limit, destroyed the regulations, this is the second illegal act of the association, (3) The founders of the association, Chen Jiufeng and others, the legal qualifications, the fundamental loss of support, and when holding the founding conference, even elected executive committee members, and elected standing committee members, the industry association, is a statutory group, the name is upright, the spirit is solemn, now the association is organized by outsiders, and preside over the association affairs, its use of the name of self-interest, abuse of public office for private gain, fraudulent behavior, is obvious, this is the third illegal act of the association, (4) The association is used by outsiders to manipulate, which is contrary to the revised Article 2 of the Industrial and Commercial Industry Association Law, contrary to the government's rule of law, causing panic among the true industry, this is the fourth illegal act of the association. Based on the above illegal points, therefore, the industry in this city who knows a little about the law, is deeply afraid of being used by others, causing disputes, so they have refused to join each other, avoid it like snakes and scorpions, the situation is panic, and they dare not be silent, the reason should be presented, ring please your ministry (bureau) to approve the order, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the People's Group Organization Permit Certificate Issuance Regulations, revoke the permit, order the dissolution of illegal organizations, so that the industry that has been registered, can be legally organized and pay the association, in accordance with the order, to comply with the law, and to protect the array, the mother's mission Sheng Ying awaits the order, and prays for instructions, is for the public use.</p>

<p>Cao Abaobao of No. 210, Xinji Bang Road, Pudong, along with Chen Aqiu and others, fellow villagers residing at No. 11, Zhangjia Alley, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, took weapons to Yun Xiangyun's farmhouse in the jurisdiction of Qingpu District 3 between the 20th and 29th of last month. They used guns to threaten silence, kidnapped his twelve-year-old son, Jin Da, and hid him in Cao's house under surveillance, not allowing him to cross the line. They sent a letter demanding a ransom of 1,000 yuan. On the morning of the 24th, Yun's concubine, Gao Gushi from Suzhou, and her daughter, Xiao Mao, went out to buy vegetables at the Xiaocai Market on Zhoujiazui Road. They were stopped near the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Tongzhou Road by Yang Xinzheng, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Detective Chen Jinsheng. Cao Adou was arrested at his house and Chen Aqiu was subsequently apprehended in Nanshi with the help of the Public Security Bureau. They were sent to the First Special District Court for detention, and his daughter Xiao Mao was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial in the third criminal court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the two defendants Cao and Chen admitted during the previous hearing that they went to You Xiangyun's house in Qingpu that night, kidnapped the child, and demanded a ransom. Gao Gushi was aware of the matter and was responsible for guarding the hostage. This morning, she went out to buy vegetables, but her lover Cao Abaobao was still eating opium in the room and hadn't gotten up yet, so she took the child out, fearing he would escape. Unexpectedly, the child took the opportunity to report the incident and was caught. Now, Qingpu County has sent personnel to transfer them, expressing their agreement. When questioned, Cao Abaobao and Chen Aqiu gave evasive answers. Gao Gushi denied knowing about the kidnapping, saying that the child was brought by Chen Aqiu, who said he was his nephew and was staying for a couple of days, asking for understanding. Yunhai said that she knew he was a hostage. The court asked her who was in charge of her Xiao Mao and furniture. She said that the furniture was temporarily managed by the second landlord, and Xiao Mao had no relatives to take care of, so she could go to Qingpu with them. The court did not allow it. She asked her daughter to give a gold ring to them to avoid losing it. Judge Zhong feared that she would take the opportunity to swallow it and commit suicide out of fear of guilt, so he ordered Cao Abaobao, Chen Aqiu, and Gao Gushi, along with the gold ring, to be handed over to Qingpu County Government bailiffs Zhu Wenyuan and Yang Hualu to be taken away after signing a pledge. Gao Xiaomao was still kept in the Jiliang Institute.</p>

<h3>New Zhabei Branch Office Smashes Two Kidnapping Cases in a Row, Rescues Two Boys, and Arrests Multiple Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Yang Yu, a detective from the detective squad of the New Zhabei Branch Bureau in Zhabei, received a report yesterday morning around 10:00 AM. The plaintiff, Hu Chunren, stated that he was 33 years old, from Funing, resided at Dong Baziqiao, and made a living selling firewood. His five-year-old son, Daqing, was kidnapped by a man named Chen A'gen on the 19th day of the tenth lunar month of the previous year at 8:00 AM. He now detected that Chen A'gen was at Dayangqiao, requesting assistance to proceed with the arrest.</p>
<p>Detective Yang immediately reported this to Captain Bao Ziying, who dispatched team leader Li Shouchun, leading the original informant, Yang Yucai, and Zhou Guicai, to rush to the location. They indeed apprehended Chen A'gen and brought him to the team. According to his confession, he was 34 years old, from Yangzhou, with no fixed residence. He sold the child to a Pan family on Huangpu Road near Gaochang Temple for 22 yuan. He entrusted an old woman, Shen He, to handle the transaction. Ms. He also lived in that area. The team then dispatched the original case handler to rush to</p>
<p>Gaochang Temple</p>
<p>to work together with police officer number 3719 from the local police station to proceed to the address. First, they arrested Shen He, then they went to the Pan family's home and rescued the kidnapped boy, Hu Daqing. They brought them back to the team after some back and forth. Shen He confessed that Chen A'gen entrusted her to sell the child to the Pan family for a total of 30 yuan. Chen received 22 yuan, which was correct. The remaining eight yuan was for writing the paper and referral fees, etc. A woman from the Pan family, Pan Pan, 33 years old, from Gaoyou, stated that she bought the child for ten yuan on the 24th day of the tenth lunar month of the previous year, introduced by Shen He. Currently, the original defendants have been sent to the</p>
<p>New Zhabei Branch Office.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Wuzhen Road police station, according to a report from Ms. Zhou Ma, residing at No. 89 Wuzhen Road, apprehended Zhang Di, Dai Wu, and a man named Wang A'ming, etc., accusing Zhang and others of kidnapping her four-year-old son, Shaoshan, on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month of this year. They also claimed that Zhang and others said the child was now in Hongkou and that a certain amount of money was needed to retrieve him. The day before yesterday afternoon, they had gone to</p>
<p>Hongkou to identify [the child]</p>
<p>Because there were no clues, they did not see the child. The station immediately reported to the Zhabei Branch Office. An officer interrogated Ms. Zhou Ma, who stated she was 38 years old and from Shaoxing. Her testimony was mostly the same as above. Zhang Di stated she was 29 years old, from Liyang, and resided at No. 29 Guoqing Road. Dai Wu stated she was 44 years old, from the same hometown as Zhang Di, and lived in the same place. Wang A'ming stated he was 40 years old, worked as a boatman, and resided at Lane 6, No. 11 Menggu Road. All the above individuals denied the accusations. The interrogating officer based the case on the</p>
<p>accusation of child abduction</p>
<p>Therefore, he ordered a written report to be prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling. Unexpectedly, just as they were about to transfer the suspects, Zhou Ma's husband, named Mei Lin, suddenly received a report from someone at a firewood shop opposite No. 89 Wuzhen Road, stating that his son, Shaoshan, was now inside the No. 506 firewood shop adjacent to the Zhifeng Road police station. Zhou immediately rushed to the location and indeed found his four-year-old son, Shaoshan, in the firewood shop. However, according to the owner of the firewood shop, the child was crying on the roadside today (i.e., yesterday) and no one claimed him, so he temporarily took care of him. This has been reported to the relevant police bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>University Student Marries Prostitute, Lovebirds Become Ill-Matched Couple, Repeated Lawsuits Lead to Recent Divorce, 500 Yuan Settlement and Separate Ways</h3>
<p>Yang Jiong, a graduate of St. John's University, 37 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 1 Lane Jia, Sanpileou, in the city, fell in love at first sight with Fei Hong, also known as Ding Yuezhen (currently 36 years old), a prostitute on Shantou Road, in 1922, thus beginning an unbreakable bond. They officially married the following year. Unexpectedly, in 1929, a rift suddenly developed between the two. Ding Yuezhen once accused Yang of assault. After mediation by friends and relatives, they reconciled. However, in 1933, Yang petitioned the First Special District Court for a divorce from Ding. After an in-court settlement, they changed to living separately, with Yang paying Ding 40 yuan per month. At the end of 1934, Yang was executed by the First Special District Court for owing Ding Yuezhen 400 yuan in living expenses, and Yang was detained for three months. Yang's mother made the decision to marry another concubine for Yang, named He Jinyu, hiding her in No. 7 Mingde Lane, Foch Road, in the French Concession. Ding and her father and brother then went to He's place and beat her, causing injuries. The court sentenced Ding Yuezhen and others to six months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. Thus, former lovebirds have now become an ill-matched couple. Therefore, Yang filed for divorce in the local court. Yesterday, after mediation by the judge, both parties agreed to separate. Yang paid Ding a settlement of 500 yuan, with 250 yuan paid first, and then 50 yuan per month until the payment was completed. From then on, the two will fly off in different directions, and not bother each other.</p>

<h3>Fire on Fuyou Road Yesterday, Nine Households Burned Consecutively, Losses Reaching 30,000-40,000 Gold, Caused by Yang Emerald Workshop</h3>

<h3>National Products Exhibition Sponsored by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (October 1st)</h3>
<p>— Hua Sheng</p>
<p>The cars on Jing'an Temple Road resembled a long snake; it was afternoon, and the opening ceremony of the National Products Exhibition was being held on the left side of the towering twenty-two-story building of the Four Banks, the tallest in the Far East. Carriages and horses were parked, carrying industrialists and promoters of national products, one by one stepping out of the carriages and entering the venue.</p>
<p>Particularly eye-catching were the solemnity of Mr. Wang Xiaoxiang and the elegance of Mr. Xu Xiaochu, as well as the five female visitors who greeted female guests under the direction of Zu Ren, and the suggestion boxes placed at both the front and back entrances of the commercial venue, all of which we, or the general public, consider valuable initiatives.</p>
<p>At 1:45 PM, with Mr. Xu Xiaochu's kind permission, he delivered a brief speech:</p>
<p>"Some people think that national product exhibitions are too production-oriented. I believe they are still worth holding. As the ancients said, 'A scholar must be looked at with new eyes after being separated for three days.' Our national product manufacturers are constantly striving for progress in the process of national product development. It is necessary to present these advancements to the public from time to time, which is why exhibitions are indispensable. This time, the participating factories have been selected from the largest and best manufacturers in various industries. Therefore, national product exhibitions not only offer a simple presentation to the outside world but also provide a platform for discussion and research among producers themselves, as well as allowing consumers to understand the progress and compare different national product offerings."</p>
<p>Having grasped Mr. Xu's insights, I took a tour around the exhibition venue. Here, there were various displays from different factories, and elaborately decorated booths, which I will describe in detail below:</p>
<p>The Anle Woolen Mill displayed mountain-like piles of yarn and also hung a bright red neon sign with the words "Hero Brand Wool Yarn." These two words, "Hero," were so red, like a hero's blood. In these days of wind and tears, they inspire the youth to heroic deeds.</p>
<p>The Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory displayed photographs of the factory's work processes and equipment setups around the booths, allowing visitors to understand the considerable greatness of China's electrical appliance industry.</p>
<p>The Meiya Silk Factory and the China Chemical Industrial Society were also quite eye-catching. The Great Southeast Tobacco Company placed a paper-made horse racing venue in a corner of the booth. The jockey and horse could rotate, which was quite an interesting toy.</p>
<p>The Tiger Balm Wing On Hall was particularly grand this time, preparing a large quantity of affordable goods for on-site sale. We know that the owner of Wing On Hall loves tigers and shares the same refined hobby as the Zhang Daqian brothers. Unexpectedly, upon entering the Wing On Hall, what immediately caught our eye were four tiger paintings by the Zhang brothers. Mr. Chen of the hall told me that the four tiger paintings were worth a thousand gold!</p>
<p>The Hua Sheng Electric Appliance Factory's display was quite outstanding, turning the story of Su Dongpo's "Night Excursion to the Red Cliffs" into artistic drawings with extremely elegant coloring, evoking aesthetic appreciation from the visitors.</p>
<p>The five characters of "Golden Coin Brand Enamel Basin" from the Yifeng Enamel Factory were also quite eye-catching. A female employee of the Yu Binqi Chinese Typewriter Factory was on-site demonstrating typing skills, showcasing the dexterity of her hands.</p>
<p>The products of the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, such as Bu Ming Dan (补使命), were highly sought after by general customers, demonstrating that clever advertising and genuine products can indeed captivate people. We also remember that this novel and clever advertising method was often used by the Huamei Tobacco Company to introduce fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and Mr. Xu of the Anmian Sleep Bed Factory earnestly guided us to visit the factory's durable and resilient products and placed a huge rock weighing 165 pounds on the mattress, without it losing its shape. It is said that this product has already become a bestseller abroad.</p>
<p>Other companies, such as the Sino-French Pharmacy and the Sino-Western Pharmacy, had special displays; the decorations and exquisite products of Zhanghua Woolen Fabric, Huacheng Tobacco Company, and Zhonghua Enamel Factory were all comparable to foreign goods.</p>
<h3>Wife's Family Commits Evil Deeds; Husband Suffers Unbearably; Helplessly Appeals to the Court</h3>
<p>Ling Yun from Huzhou makes a living by selling animals. He married Ling Chen, also known as Chen Zhaodi, from Yancheng. They lived with his wife's mother, Chen Sun, and his wife's younger brother, Chen Guoliang, also known as Da Shunzi, at No. 13 Deren Lane, Changan Road, to take care of each other. Unexpectedly, the wife's family were all evil-doers, treating Ling Yun like a henpecked husband, constantly beating and scolding him. Ling could not bear the suffering. At the end of last month, Ling attempted to resist and was severely beaten by his wife's family, causing injuries. Ling then appealed to the District Court, accusing his wife Ling Chen, his wife's younger brother Chen Guoliang, and his wife's mother Chen Sun of assault. After the prosecutor verified the facts, a public prosecution was initiated. Yesterday, Judge Yu held a trial, during which Ling Yun tearfully recounted his suffering and accused the defendants of assault. The defendants denied the assault. The judge concluded the debate and adjourned for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Measures for Implementing Broadcasting Education in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has formulated measures for implementing broadcasting education in various provinces and cities and issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to comply with the measures. The measures consist of eleven articles, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  In order to urge the implementation of broadcasting education in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education has specifically formulated these measures.</p>
<p>2.  In order to universally implement broadcasting education, the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should designate one staff member in the department or section in charge of social education to handle administrative matters related to broadcasting education, or jointly establish one administrative personnel for electro-optical education with those handling film education.</p>
<p>3.  Each province and city should divide the entire territory into broadcasting education guidance areas, and each area should set up one instructor who will handle broadcasting education matters in the area under the instructions of the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus. Such personnel must be employed from among the faculty and staff of the larger radio organizations in the area who have been qualified by the Ministry of Education's broadcasting training (if funding is difficult, this instructor may be concurrently held by the staff of the original service agency who have received training, and a subsidy will be given). The service measures will be determined separately.</p>
<p>4.  The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should install radios in accordance with the "Ministry of Education's Issuance of National Secondary Schools and Public Education Halls to Install Radios" and comply with the "Ministry's Issuance of Notices on the Use of Educational Broadcasting in Various Schools and Halls" to earnestly handle the matter.</p>
<p>5.  Radio components will be centrally purchased or customized by the Ministry of Education and distributed to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities in accordance with items 3 and 4 of the "Ministry's Issuance of Measures for the Education Departments and Bureaus of Various Provinces and Cities to Pay the Price of Radio in Installments." The provinces and cities should also formulate measures to subsidize schools and halls to install radios, ensuring that even impoverished counties and districts can universally set up radios.</p>
<p>6.  The salaries of broadcasting instructors in each province and city's broadcasting guidance area, the cost of purchasing radios, and the recurring expenses will be financed from the education funds of each province and city, and will be earmarked as special funds. However, provinces with actual financial difficulties may have the Ministry of Education consider the situation and subsidize part or all of the cost of purchasing radios.</p>
<p>7.  In order to facilitate the promotion of work, the education departments and bureaus of each province and city and each broadcasting guidance area may establish broadcasting education service centers separately, which will be responsible for handling the installation, repair, power supply, and answering questions from all walks of life regarding radio by the administrative personnel handling broadcasting education and the broadcasting education instructors of each area.</p>
<p>8.  Provinces and cities that have already established broadcasting stations should rebroadcast the educational programs of the Central Radio Station on time, and set up their own educational programs.</p>
<p>9.  The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should formulate measures to reward and punish the administrative personnel of broadcasting education and the radio organizations that handle broadcasting education, and limit them to report the work situation on a regular basis for evaluation. Each department and bureau may also hold listener tests for educational broadcasting in various fields to assess the listening results.</p>
<p>10. The provincial and county supervisors and education halls should include the radio operation in the grades of the schools and halls.</p>
<p>11. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should submit a report to the Ministry of Education for record within one month after the end of each semester, detailing the broadcasting education situation in the previous semester, and include it as one of the education administrative evaluations of the provinces and cities.</p>

<h3>Mr. Pan Gongzhan Praises the Essence of High School and Junior High School Composition; With This Compilation in Hand, National Youth Will Surely Improve Their Composition Skills</h3>
<p>The "National Modern High School Composition Essence" and "National Modern Junior High School Composition Essence," recently published by Qinfen Bookstore at 277 Simalu, Shanghai, are excellent works of students from more than 4,000 high schools and junior high schools across the country. After detailed review by national studies experts Hu Pu'an, Tai Shuangqiu, Dean of the School of Education of Daxia University, and Xie En, Supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, more than 2,000 of the best writings were selected and compiled by Ma Chonggan, Supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. They are divided into thirteen major categories: narrative, description, argumentation, academics, postscripts, description, essays, biographies, applications, novels, poems, translations, and dramas. All kinds of topics are available. Middle school students can admire the writing of outstanding students from equal schools across the country, and educational researchers can observe the level of composition of middle school students across the country. The two books total 1.2 million words, a magnificent spectacle. The title of the Minister of Education, Wang Shijie, is highly praised by the directors of the education departments and bureaus of various provinces. The praise of Pan Gong Zhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, is excerpted as follows: "...Mr. Ma Chonggan, the editor of this book, in order to facilitate the general study of composition by young people, has worked hard and spent a lot of energy to collect the essence of national talents and publish them in two editions, high school and junior high school, which are full of everything and are more than just a cultural exposition. To offer it to the national youth, its merit is great. If the youth of the country have this compilation in their hands, it is truly "a gathering of all the wise men, discussing in one hall." Comparing and measuring with their own works, diligently cultivating and excavating, they will surely make more achievements and progress in composition skills..." In order to give preferential treatment to students, Qinfen Bookstore has generated a special price. Each high school and junior high school volume has 600,000 words, each with four thick volumes, and each volume is only sold for 55 cents.

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>Chinese Sports Association Welcomes World Games Delegation Yesterday; Wang Zhengting and Others Attended and Gave Speeches</h3>
<p>The Chinese Sports Association held a tea party at its clubhouse on Dongxinqiao Street at 2:00 PM yesterday to welcome the delegation from our country attending the World Games and the members of the sports delegation. The guests and hosts present included Wang Zhengting, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Yun Chu, Zhou Bangjun, Wang Boqi, Zhang Qidong, Shen Yuguang, Fu Shuyun, Liu Yuhua, Zhang Erding, Jin Shisheng, Wen Jingming, Ye Dami, Zheng Huaixian, Zhai Lianyuan, Kou Yunxing, Zhang Wenguang, Ling Xitao, Song Fuzhang, Xu Zhiyi, Gu Shunhua, and Sun Cunzhou, totaling more than a hundred people, presided over by Xu Zhiyi.</p>
<p>Chairman Announces</p>
<p>First, Chairman Xu Zhiyi delivered a welcome speech, stating that there are three points for our people to welcome the World Games delegation: (1) It is undeniable that our country's sports are backward. The delegation's trip abroad has given them a clearer understanding, and they will definitely work hard from the quantitative aspect to develop our country's sports. (2) After this trip abroad, the delegation must have a feeling, that is, after comparing the country seen at the World Games with the national strength of various countries, it will definitely arouse the concept of the country. From this point of view, we will eliminate private opinions, not divide into factions, and work together to lay a new foundation for Chinese sports. (3) This time, our country's World Games National Arts team performed abroad and has been praised by people from all countries. In the future, the Chinese people will have a deeper belief in National Arts and jointly promote the development of National Arts.</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Li Zhaohuan delivered a speech, stating that he welcomes the delegation back to the country from the standpoint of the education community. In the past, Chinese education, especially school education, has not paid attention to sports. In the early days, schools that paid attention to sports focused on cross-country track and field. Now, regardless of men or women, they have all paid attention to sports, and people from all walks of life have also paid attention to it. As representatives of the motherland, they traveled far across the ocean. Although they were not successful, the delegation's feelings and experiences will definitely make them work harder for sports. I hope that the delegation will pay more attention to sports ethics in addition to working hard in sports to complete a perfect athlete.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Wang Zhengting, the general leader of the World Games, gave a speech, stating that he is deeply sorry that the delegation was unable to come in full today because they are eager to return home. The development of sports in China is currently very slow. In other countries, those who love sports account for nine-tenths of the total population, while in our country, it only accounts for one-thousandth. Looking at the talents of the past National Games, they are all concentrated in major cities, so increasing the quantity is the most urgent task at present. Our country's government has now paid attention to sports, such as the construction of large sports fields in Beijing and Shanghai, but it is a pity that they are relatively far from the city and the effect is not great. I hope that in the future, each county can have a complete sports field, and I hope that the press will vigorously promote it so that the Chinese people who are addicted to bad entertainment can all be transformed into sports enthusiasts. Furthermore, our country's National Arts have been highly praised abroad, and I hope to work hard to promote them so that they can be popularized. After Wang's speech, Wu Yun Chu, Gu Shunhua, Xu Xiaochu, and others gave speeches in succession. The speeches were long and are omitted. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM for a group photo.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Registration for Various Groups in the City Games; Registration Deadline Set for the 11th</h3>
<p>The 4th City Games in this city are scheduled to be held at the City Center Sports Field starting on the 22nd of this month. Since registration began on the 1st of this month, more than 40 schools, including colleges, universities, middle schools, and sports schools, have registered for various groups. Individual registration for the open group is also quite enthusiastic. The registration deadline is set for the 11th of this month. Registration for the National Arts group is at the City National Arts Hall. Participants should not go to the City Sports Field in vain. Many prizes have been donated by all walks of life. As for the requirement that the clothing of each school participating in the mass exercises must be uniform, it means that the clothing of each unit must be uniform. The Boy Scout uniform or school uniform can be determined by each school itself. Each school must be proficient in the teaching materials for the mass exercises.</p>
<h3>Problems of China's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>When it comes to China's economy, especially the problems of China's economic construction, it truly involves a myriad of complexities. Not only are ordinary people often confused, but even so-called scholars and experts hold differing opinions due to their subjective stances and limited environments. Consequently, no definite and consistent conclusion has ever been reached. In the past, there were debates about China's economic structure, followed by discussions about whether to prioritize agriculture or industry, whether to adopt a laissez-faire or controlled approach, and whether to utilize foreign capital, among other things. More recently, extensive and concrete debates have unfolded regarding whether China's population is excessive, whether there is sufficient land, and whether there are abundant resources, further complicating the issue of China's economic construction.</p>
<p>However, here, we want to point out the most significant and common mistake made by some people: First, some even place China's economy on the same model as advanced capitalist countries, while ignoring China's own material basis. Since the fundamental standpoint is incorrect, no matter what "-ization" or what route they discuss, they will embark on a path of extreme error. Second, some honestly do not understand the laws of economic development, especially the common run of vulgar economists, who, confined within their very narrow theories, will never be able to dissect the current extremely intricate and complex economic society. Therefore, asking such people to discuss China's economic construction is like having blind men ride blind horses. Third, some estimate China's material environment far too shortsightedly, truly displaying the foolishness of "scholars." They often make superficial judgments based solely on what they subjectively know. For example, regarding China's population, land, and resources, they estimate that China's available land is far too poor, and they seem to only see the trees and not the forest when it comes to China's resources. Fourth, some excessively worship idols, often assuming that everything said by "experts" and "scholars" is correct. Thus, without questioning what these "experts" and "scholars" are presenting, they unhesitatingly accept it as the absolute truth, fearing being left behind, and even treat it as the standard argument for discussing issues. In this way, they also go down the wrong path.</p>
<p>We believe that to study China's economy and discuss the problems of China's economic construction, at least the following important premises must not be ignored in the slightest:</p>
<p>We must understand the material basis of China's economy, that is, what China's unique economic structure actually is.</p>
<p>We must recognize the fundamental factors behind the current economic panic in China, that is, why has China's economy reached this state?</p>
<p>We must have a concrete and accurate understanding of China's material environment. This is a necessary condition for economic construction.</p>
<p>II. The Material Basis of China's Economy and its Panic</p>
<p>The material basis of China's economy was a hotly debated issue more than four years ago. Although the discussions did not lead to a definitive conclusion, it seemed to be generally recognized by most people that China's economy was a "semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy." Here, we originally had no need for re-examination. However, regrettably, vulgar views still occupy a considerable force in the field of China's economy, putting up a theoretical resistance. Therefore, we are compelled to re-examine and present the material basis of China's economy while studying the problems of China's economic construction.</p>
<p>The components contained within China's economic sphere are truly complex, mainly: a semi-feudal agricultural economy, a fragile national industry, and the various economic forces of imperialism. These intertwine to form this deformed Chinese economic structure—a semi-feudal, pre-capitalist, semi-colonial economy.</p>
<p>Originally, although China was also invaded by the torrent of capitalism, the domestic relations of production remained stagnant in feudalism. Although it outwardly displayed the appearance of capitalism, the land exploitation relationship was still based on feudal foundations. The two opposing sides were not simply capitalists who occupied the means of production and extracted surplus value from laborers who had no means of production and sold their labor; rather, on one side were warlords, landlords, local tyrants, usurers, commercial capitalists, etc., who relied on feudal-style exploitation for survival, and on the other side were the vast numbers of tenant farmers, poor peasants, declining middle peasants, and handicraftsmen who were exploited. As for the inflow and outflow of various commodities in the countryside, this was indeed quite capitalist-ized. However, it was limited to the simple process of circulation, merely the commodity economy of imperialism (dumping goods, seizing raw materials) manifested on the rural society through comprador capital and commercial capital. It fundamentally could not be confused with the relations of production, and it did not overthrow the original relations.</p>
<p>Feudal forces and imperialism were mutually colluding: warlords, landlords, local tyrants, commercial capitalists, etc., relied on imperialism to maintain their political and economic lives; imperialism, in turn, relied on warlords, landlords, local tyrants, commercial capitalists, etc., to establish its political power, complete its commodity dumping, and obtain raw materials. In this way, the Chinese countryside, under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal forces, naturally became poorer day by day. Not only was it impossible to improve technology and increase production, but it was even unable to maintain its low-level reproduction. Therefore, the collapse of China's agricultural economy was inevitable, not accidental. Some believe that China's land is not sufficient to support China's population. This is obviously not a correct statement. In reality, it is absolutely not that China's land is insufficient, but that production is undeveloped. Ignoring this point, one cannot discuss China's population problem and land problem, and one is not qualified to discuss China's economic construction problem.</p>
<p>Under the aforementioned restrictions, China's national industry naturally had no way to develop soundly. Imperialism's cheap goods (imported from its home country or manufactured in factories in China) not only destroyed China's original handicrafts, but also prevented all new industries from rising. Only during the European war era, when various countries were busy dealing with their own wars and had no energy to manage the Far East market, did China's national industry experience a short-term growth. However, like a fleeting bloom, it was still overwhelmed by imperialist forces after the war. Industrial development must be based on a broad market. Since China had no power to transport and sell goods abroad, and its own domestic market was invaded by imperialism, how could China's national industry prosper!</p>
<p>Imperialist forces controlled everything in China, whether it was agriculture, industry, or transportation, and even in politics, there was the evil hand of imperialism. On one hand, domestic reactionary feudal forces relied on the support of imperialism to stubbornly persist. In this way, China's economy could not achieve regular development. China's national capital was extremely weak, and the occupying forces were still comprador capital under the protection of imperialism. This is another special form under semi-colonialism.</p>
<p>Understanding the material basis of China's economy means grasping a large part of the factors behind China's economic panic. We already know that China's economy is controlled by the collusion of imperialism and feudal forces. The inevitable consequence of this change will produce the following phenomena: the rural economy collapses due to heavy exploitation, and the masses of peasants are extremely impoverished; national industry is suppressed and fragmented, and large numbers of unemployed workers take to the streets; due to the above two reasons, purchasing power decreases sharply, leading to commercial decline, production stagnation, and credit stagnation... brewing an unmanageable situation. This is the root cause of China's economic panic. Therefore, China's economic panic is not something that emerged overnight; it has been developing for a long time, transitioning from chronic to acute.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must absolutely not ignore the severity of the great panic caused by the recent intensification of imperialist aggression. China's economy is a link in the world economy, and every change in the world economy will directly and indirectly affect China's economic activities. However, China's economy is not autonomous. As mentioned above, China is a semi-colony, so it can only serve as a subordinate secondary link in the world economy with a subsidiary status. For this reason, China has even become a discharge point for the world economic panic. Capitalist countries are doing their best to transfer their own panic to colonies and semi-colonies; therefore, China's economic panic is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>In addition to the general means of intensifying commodity dumping, etc., the specific actions that imperialism has recently taken against China, causing the massive economic panic since last summer, are mainly the following, as everyone knows: the US silver policy of the previous year, the British gold pound activities, and the ongoing military aggression of a certain imperialist power. The US silver policy accelerated the outflow of Chinese silver, and the British gold pound activities pushed China's credit panic to a higher level. These effects, which manifested not long ago, cannot be denied. But the most fatal blow was undoubtedly the military aggression of a certain imperialist power! The loss of the four northeastern provinces and the change in color of Chahar and eastern Hebei resulted in the loss of millions of square miles of land and its resources, and tens of millions of people and their purchasing power; secondly, the invasion of Shanghai shocked China's financial center, further increasing China's economic panic. The battles at the passes of the Great Wall and the subsequent disturbances in Hebei and Chahar destroyed the lifeblood of North China's economy. Under the sinister situation where governance is mainly based on prestige and military backing, not to mention the complete loss of China's economic future, even the status of the nation is unthinkable.</p>
<p>III. China's Economic Way Out</p>
<p>Regarding the work of rescuing China's economic panic, the efforts shown by all parties recently are indeed not without effort; however, if we only use passive and incomplete methods, even if we can treat the symptoms temporarily, we still cannot save China's economic plight. Therefore, many people have put forward opinions on the active construction of China's economy; however, there are many factions on the issue of construction routes, truly showing a colorful phenomenon. For example, in terms of focus, there are agriculturalist factions and industrialist factions, and factions that emphasize both industry and agriculture; in terms of system, there are capitalist factions, socialist factions, and livelihoodist factions; in terms of methods, there are laissez-faire factions, controlled economy factions, etc. Here, we will take the emphasis on agriculture and industry as a starting point to examine the path that China's economy should take:</p>
<p>The industrialist faction believes that clinging to agriculture is a backward move, and that China must actively industrialize following advanced capitalist countries for China's economy to have a chance of prosperity. They also say that with the development of its own industry, import surpluses will naturally disappear. There are also those who advocate industry first and then agriculture, which is the opposite of the aforementioned view of agriculture first and then industry. They believe that industrial construction is the foundation of agricultural construction, and the raw materials produced in agriculture must find a market in industrial development. At the same time, the machinery, technology, etc. required in agriculture must be supplied after industrial development.</p>
<p>I deeply feel that everyone in the above two factions has some prejudices. We should broaden our horizons. Not only does China urgently need to rescue agriculture, but it also urgently needs to rescue industry; not only does China urgently need to rescue industry, but it also urgently needs to rescue agriculture. We cannot be biased towards any one side. Moreover, the two are fundamentally like a hand and an arm, and should not be forcibly separated. The dependence of agriculture on industry and the dependence of industry on agriculture are equally close. Industrial construction certainly needs the raw materials produced in agriculture and the vast market in rural areas; agricultural construction also cannot do without industrial development to sell raw materials and supply machinery and technology. Therefore, the problem is not mechanically agriculturalizing or industrializing, nor is it individually about who comes first and who comes later, but should be advancing side by side. Many modern capitalist countries, although their industry is prosperous, have not neglected agriculture. The United States is the most obvious example. Even if a few countries particularly emphasize industry, they have colonies and semi-colonies to adjust, places to sell goods, and places to collect raw materials, which is built on the exploitation or squeezing of colonies and semi-colonies. If China were to simply industrialize, who would it exploit? Although China has the extra power to compete for other people's markets and obtain other people's raw materials? Also, the Soviet Union should originally be regarded as an agricultural country, but in its two five-year plans, it also attached importance to industry and devoted itself to the construction of both, and has now become a prosperous country with both agriculture and industry flourishing. If China were to simply agriculturalize, it would only be worthy of being a colony to supply raw materials and resources. Yes, perhaps someone will ask: "China does not have the resources to take care of both, so it can only focus on solving one." This is seemingly true, but we have already said above that agriculture and industry cannot be mechanically separated individually. A single path will encounter deeper difficulties due to the lack of mutual assistance; on the contrary, if the two can be reconciled and coordinated, the resources consumed will actually be reduced. For example, when developing the cotton textile industry, if the country's cotton production is abundant, high-quality, and well-allocated, there is no need to spend extra money on imports from abroad; similarly, if the conditions for cotton production are complete, if the country's textile industry is developed, it will not be taken away in large quantities at low prices. (Of course, there are political factors in the current seizure of cotton flowers in North China.)</p>
<p>However, I am not like many who emphasize both agriculture and industry, wanting to capitalistize both China's agriculture and industry, or to develop agriculture under the feudal system and develop industry under the capitalist system. (In fact, it is absolutely impossible for agriculture to develop on the relations of production of the old feudal society; and it is also impossible to develop capitalism while feudal relations in agriculture exist.) I am against both capitalism and maintaining the feudal system. We must certainly overthrow the old feudal society, but we do not necessarily have to blindly follow the declining path of capitalism step by step. We should directly proceed in the direction of no exploitation.</p>
<p>Here, we want to turn to the question of whether China has enough arable land. It is very funny that many people blindly follow and sing that China's land is not enough to distribute to the population, and then conclude that China's agricultural construction is impossible. This is truly a rare strange argument!</p>
<p>According to the estimates of several "scholars" and "experts": the maximum amount of arable land in China does not exceed 900,000 square miles. After deducting mountains, rivers, lakes, towns, residences, roads, etc., about 20% to 30%, the truly arable land in the country is only 700,000 square miles, equivalent to about 3 billion mu. After deducting the approximately 1.4 billion mu that has already been cultivated, there are only 1.5 to 1.6 billion mu of uncultivated land left. They believe that China's arable land is mostly limited to the east, central, and southern regions, while the northwest is almost entirely barren, and they only count them as 50,000 to 60,000 square miles, equivalent to about 200 million mu. This is too far from the actual situation, as Zhang Tingxiu said: "Simply extracting a barren area to represent the northwest is like using only desert cattle and sheep to represent the culture of Xinjiang and Mongolia in the Central Photography Studio, which makes people feel endless regret!" (See Zhang's "Quantity and Quality of the Chinese Nation" in the third issue of the third volume of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Education Museum Quarterly, Autumn of this year)</p>
<p>In fact, although there are many sandy and saline areas in the northwest, there is also quite a lot of arable land. According to recent surveys alone, the northern part of the inner eight banners of Chahar, the ten banners of Xilin Gol League, Darlangga, the front and back sets of fertile land in Suiyuan's three lake bays, the Yellow Dragon Mountain in Shaanxi, Yongshou, Hanzhong, the three states of Gan, Liang, and Su in Gansu, Pingliang County, Ningxia's Ejina Torghut Banner, Qinghai's Dulan, Yushu, Xining, and Qaidam, and other areas are said to be suitable for cultivation. The land in Xinjiang, Xikang, and Tibet is also definitely not as bad as people imagine. Outer Mongolia, which is considered a desert, has been proven by Soviet experts to be able to be transformed into fertile farmland through scientific irrigation; and according to people who have been to Xinjiang, there is indeed a lot of fertile land there, especially from Dihua to Yining, which is more suitable for production. As for Xikang and Tibet, although the terrain is high and the climate is often harsh, there are still many places that can be cultivated where the rivers flow through the valleys, and it is definitely not like some scholars say that there is absolutely nothing usable.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is really a lot of usable land in China. According to the estimates of the American Baker (O.E. Bader), there are still 2.5 billion mu of reclaimable land in China, which is equivalent to two or three times the existing arable land. There is an unknown amount of uncalculated and undiscovered arable land in the rest of China. If we do a good job of investigation and make the investigation technology complete, there will definitely be shocking revelations. According to the records of Ningxia before the land survey, there were 800,000 mu of cultivated land, and after the survey, the cultivated land reached 2 million mu, more than tripling the original number, which shows the importance of investigation and measurement.</p>
<p>Future developments are even more limitless. There are already many examples of science overcoming great difficulties. Places that are now considered definitely uncultivable may not always be useless fertile land in the future. Let's look at Siberia. Whether in terms of climate or region, it was once considered a barren desert that could not produce anything and was only worthy of being a desolate place for prisoners to be exiled; however, it has now been developed very impressively by the Soviet Union. Collective farms are cultivating on a large area, and the cultivated land is expanding day by day. Similarly, our Mongolia, Xinjiang, Kangzang, and the provinces of the northwest can also be very optimistic if they undergo a thorough investigation and measurement. We must never give up on ourselves and let others seize the initiative.</p>
<p>China has such a vast fertile land, who says that China cannot embark on agricultural construction! (Don't forget the most fertile virgin four northeastern provinces that have been lost!)</p>
<p>Some people have also presented China's annual grain imports as an example of insufficient land, which is 100% absurd. They not only erased the fact that China still has a large amount of uncultivated fertile land, but also ignored the specificity of China's land production. It is very obvious that under the oppression of imperialism and the control of feudal forces, the productive forces of China's land have not developed to the height they should have. It is said that the production of wheat per mu in Denmark is about 393.32 catties, while in China it is only 123.00 catties, a difference of more than three times. Barley production in Denmark is 364 catties, while in China it is 135 catties. Potato production in Denmark is 2368 catties, while in China it is 751 catties. Secondly, due to the backwardness of transportation tools in China, improper distribution, waste, and spoilage also contribute to the shortage of food. Moreover, the actual amount of grain import surplus is very small in the total consumption. According to Mr. Zhang Yintang's estimate of grain imports in the past ten years, the most in a year is only about 3% of China's grain consumption (Mr. Zhang's speech on the food problem in the national self-salvation movement at Tsinghua University in April of this year). If we can slightly adjust evenly or slightly improve production, we can get rid of these numbers. Therefore, it is obviously extremely inappropriate to look at China's land problem solely from the perspective of trade.</p>
<p>In short, China's agricultural construction is difficult, and there is no need to worry about the lack of land, but only to remove the obstacles to construction.</p>
<p>In addition, there are those who say that China is poor in mineral resources and determine that China cannot implement industrial construction, and there are even those who say that Chinese people are incompetent and useless and are not worthy of discussing any construction. There are so many absurd self-defeating arguments that it is impossible to list them all here.</p>
<p>Of course, in economic construction (whether agricultural or industrial), we must mention the aforementioned obstruction of feudal forces and imperialism. Feudal elements are absolutely unwilling to see China's economy making forward progress, as this would destroy the inherent relations of production and affect their improper interests. For example, landlords rely on the old exploitation relations to maintain their survival, so they fundamentally oppose the redistribution of land and any innovation; they even do not want to improve land production, because after production is improved, the price of agricultural products will fall, which will affect the rent they receive.</p>
<p>Imperialists, on the one hand, collude with feudal elements, hindering the normal construction of China's economy and reasonable social reforms, and support the reactionary forces of feudalism; on the other hand, they actively undermine the development of China's industry and agriculture. The cheap goods they transport from abroad or manufacture in factories in China not only overwhelm the rise of China's national industry, but also penetrate into the countryside, causing the entire countryside to go bankrupt. It is not just limited to these simple things. Under the parallel aggression of economic, political, and military forces in recent years, everything we have has been arbitrarily cut, divided, slaughtered, and we don't even have the opportunity to stretch our backs. How can we still build well!</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important issue in China's economic construction is not the mechanical emphasis on agriculture and industry, but the obstruction of these evil forces. When we talk about construction, if we forget these two major enemies and the current national crisis, then everything is just empty talk. In summary, if China does not eliminate feudal forces and eliminate imperialist forces, there is not much hope for the future of economic construction. This is not our intention to be pessimistic, but to keep in step with the major foreign enemies!</p>
<p>IV. International Cooperation and Economic Partnership</p>
<p>Finally, we want to incidentally discuss the issue of international cooperation and so-called economic partnership. We certainly do not want to stubbornly "build a car behind closed doors" (in reality, this is also impossible), so we sincerely welcome international cooperation and foreign assistance. However, cooperation must be absolutely equal, and assistance must have absolutely no conditions that harm China's sovereignty. We are willing to accept foreign good-intentioned loans and investments; however, this cannot be used as a tool to manipulate China's finances and control China's resources. If the above basic principles are violated, then everything should be opposed by the Chinese people. Especially the recent so-called "economic partnership" (especially in North China), which is very lively in name but is actually an invasion, we really dare not accept the hospitality. Undoubtedly, this will cut off the lifeline of China's economy! It is not our intention to be alarmist, but it is an undeniable iron fact and an inevitable development. On the surface, the mission of economic partnership is very appealing: helping China develop transportation, develop resources, rescue farmers, stabilize finance and finance, etc.... it seems that we should be grateful to the point of kneeling down; however, what is the real content? Look:</p>
<p>First, the so-called construction of interlaced transportation lines is to prepare to transport China's rich deposits in large quantities and quickly export them, and to dump XX's commodities in large quantities and universally into the inland. Railways are also the most important tool in the military, and in the continued process of aggression, they will play a very important role. For example, the role of the Jinshi Railway is to accelerate the export of agricultural products along the way and coal production in Shanxi economically, and to accelerate the import of XX's commodities; militarily, it connects the Beining, Jinpu, Pinghan, and Zhengtai lines and is used for wartime transportation.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called development of mineral resources is to plunder China's reserves, especially coal and iron, and give it to it to develop industry, give it to it to manufacture cannons, machine guns, and all kinds of lethal weapons. It is said that Shanxi's coal, Chahar's iron, Hebei's gold, and Shandong's silver and copper are the initial targets.</p>
<p>Third, the so-called improvement of agricultural products is not to rescue Chinese farmers, but to squeeze Chinese farmers. It wants Chinese farmers to be its slaves for life. The main purpose is to buy agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, and wool at low prices to solve its raw material panic and food panic, and to prepare for future wars.</p>
<p>Fourth, XX not only uses the commodities produced in its own country to smuggle (now it is no longer smuggling)! Methods to dump, but also actively set up factories in China to manufacture on the spot, and want to completely destroy China's only national industry. The decline of Tianjin's Chinese textile industry is the best illustration. In addition to the cotton textile industry, the next are the wool textile industry, electrical industry, match industry, flour industry, rayon industry, glass industry, ceramic industry, and various chemical industries and machinery industries, all of which are planned for expansion.</p>
<p>Fifth, the so-called assistance to stabilize China's finance and finance is to control the soul of China's economy; assistance is actually destruction, hindering currency unification, controlling the silver in North China, and cutting off China's tariffs through smuggling, all of which are destroying finance and finance and making it fall into a fragmented situation, which is conducive to the implementation of their aggression plan.</p>
<p>In short, partnership is the incarnation of aggression, and even a five-foot-tall child in China knows it. There is also the so-called "industry XX, agriculture China," China is forever only worthy of being a colony. This may be the "equal and mutually beneficial" cooperation that a certain economic expert said is like a professor and a rickshaw driver! But who wants to be a rickshaw driver for life!</p>

<h3>Western Union Football First Division Match: Donghua Defeats Western Police Yesterday; 3-1, First Half a 1-1 Draw</h3>
<p>The Donghua Football Club played the Western Police team in the Western Union First Division match at Yiyuan yesterday. Although Donghua's main players Sun Jinshun and You Liang have returned from their European tour, they were rested due to travel fatigue. As the Western Police had always been their defeated opponents, they faced them with the same lineup as last week. As a result, Donghua's right-back was slightly careless in the first half, leading to a 1-1 draw. In the second half, the lineup was tighter, resulting in a clean two-goal victory. Overall, Donghua won 3-1. Sun Jia also came to the field to watch the match. He will play in the next game. Xiao Heitan (Little Black Coal) Chen Zhenhe has also been rumored to join Donghua since returning the day before yesterday, and it is likely to happen on the 19th. The lineups and match details of both sides yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Club</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning Zhuang Weixin</p>
<p>Gu Shangquan Feng Yunyou Shu Shigeng</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Li Yichen Dai Linjing Xu Wenkui Xue Wen</p>
<p>Western Police Team</p>
<p>Bowes May</p>
<p>Turner Torres Bigotte</p>
<p>Jebbson Whill Haylett Deffy Pett Okele</p>
<p>Match Details</p>
<p>The Western Police attacked first. Western Police's main player Gash was absent, and they started with only ten players. Soon, Western Police's right-back May arrived late, completing the team. Donghua's momentum was extremely high. The attack failed, and a slight error allowed Western Police's center forward Deffy to break through the defense. He passed left while lying on the ground, Whill sped over and swept a shot, Zhang Rongcai hurried to rescue but missed, and Western Police opened the scoring, just eight minutes after the start. Donghua worked hard to counter-attack fiercely. Feng Yunyou passed, Xiao Wan passed, Xu Wenkui caught up with a shot and succeeded, making it 1-1. Then, both sides exchanged attacks, but Donghua had more opportunities. The first half ended with a 1-1 draw.</p>
<h3>Donghua Scores Consecutive Goals</h3>
<p>Shortly after the restart, Donghua's Xue, Xu, and Li pulled off a wonderful triangular pass, but unfortunately, Wenxiu's shooting was not strong enough. A surge appeared again in front of Donghua's goal. The Western Police cavalry was all over the place. Fortunately, Rongcai jumped up and saved the situation. Xu Wenkui crossed the halfway line and went straight in, scoring another goal, making it 2-1 for Donghua. The Western Police were under attack everywhere, surrounded by enemies. Li Yichen and Wan Xianghua's subsequent shots were unsuccessful. Suddenly, the Western Police got a free kick. Deffy's header hit the post and bounced out. Deffy headed again, and Rongcai caught it. This was the most dangerous situation Donghua encountered. Afterwards, the Western Police gradually declined, and the game was controlled by Donghua again. Wan Xianghua passed to the center, Linjing rushed over and scored from ten yards, resulting in a 3-1 victory.</p>

<p>The first basketball championship competition organized by the Shanghai Transportation Department's Sports Federation opened yesterday at the Shenyuan Basketball Court. Attendees included Director Xu Duo of the Postal Service, Chen Xuliang of China Merchants, Jiang Kun of the International Radio Station, and over 200 guests.

China Merchants took the lead all the way, winning the first half 21-9. In the second half, the Postal &amp; Remittance Services team ran out of steam, and China Merchants' veteran Chen Yong'an scored repeatedly, eventually winning 57-12. In the second match between Telephone and Eurasia, the fighting power of the two sides was equal, with the score differing by only one point. Unfortunately, the Eurasia team was unfamiliar with the rules, resulting in three of their players committing fouls. In the final moments, they were outnumbered and lost several goals, leading to a defeat by the Telephone team. In the third match, Postal Services faced Telegraph. The match was even more intense. Postal Services were calmer and won 12-11.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Participating in the World Games and European Tour – The Rejuvenated Germany (1)</h3>
<p>– Li Huitang</p>
<p>This time, at the 11th Summer Olympics held in Berlin, I consider myself fortunate not to be relegated to the ranks of the backward. I was selected to represent football, and this participation allowed me to fulfill my decade-long dream of touring Europe, which I had started and stopped intermittently. Recalling the disappointment six years ago when the Lehua team aspired to tour Europe but was aborted midway, I feel this European trip is especially sweet.</p>
<p>Now that the weary bird has returned and the European tour is a thing of the past, this trip was hasty, and there was not enough time or opportunity to make a more detailed and thorough observation. This is indeed a pity. However, in the process of skimming through, we also had many vague and confused impressions of what we saw and heard, especially about the football of various countries. Because most of our time was spent on football, and most of our contact was with matters closely related to football, the impressions gained were inevitably deeper than those about other things like "society," "culture," "construction," and "customs." My "Thoughts on Participating in the World Games and European Tour" are traces that I have recalled from those confused and vague impressions using my memory. What I write are my personal observations. I hope that all sectors will point out any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The host country of the Summer Olympics was Germany, and the location of the games was Berlin. Comparatively speaking, we stayed in Germany the longest during this European tour, and we had more opportunities to hear, know, see, and observe things. Therefore, in my "Thoughts on the European Tour," I want to write about "The Rejuvenated Germany" first. I will list the good things about Germany that I know here, hoping that those in charge in our country can adopt a spirit of striving for progress based on the idea that "the stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade," taking the long and cutting the short, and also rejuvenate the current China, which has no vitality.</p>
<p>I dare not say that everything in Germany is only good and not bad. However, at the very least, there are more good things than bad things inside. The good things are exposed and easily seen, while the bad things are hidden and not easily noticed. Moreover, during this conference, hundreds of thousands of foreigners from all over the world rushed to Berlin to join in the fun. The German government naturally tried its best to expose everything and take advantage of this opportunity to make a major international publicity campaign. The German leader Hitler said it well, "We are the hosts this time, and we hope that the German government and the public will unite and fulfill our responsibilities as hosts, so that no foreigner will have any dissatisfaction before or after leaving Germany." From this, we can deduce how thorough the Germans' preparations were this time and how great their hopes were for using this publicity opportunity.</p>
<p>Germany, which was almost unable to stand firmly after the European War, has been struggling and striving for more than ten years. Under Hitler's administration and rule, the rejuvenated Third Reich has been completed today. Of course, we cannot observe their political secrets and military secrets. Now, I will list their more exposed and obvious good points separately:</p>
<p>(1) Cleanliness</p>
<p>Upon entering Germany, the first thing that catches the eye of foreigners is the cleanliness of the streets. No matter where, they are all cleaned spotlessly. It is unlikely that you will get your clothes dirty even if you sleep on the road. Pedestrians do not spit on the road at will. Sometimes, if fruit peels or scraps of paper are found on the road, people will rush to pick them up and throw them into the boxes on the side of the road. Sometimes, if they cannot find a trash can, they will stuff them into their bags, sacrificing their own clothes to maintain public cleanliness. As for cigarette butts, they are even more difficult to see. If those who pick up cigarette butts in our country go to Germany to make a living, I am afraid they will starve to death immediately. In short, cleanliness is the easiest thing to feel upon arriving in Germany, especially for those of us who are used to seeing the inland of China.</p>
<p>(2) Strong Nation</p>
<p>The healthy nation of Germany is also very easy for foreigners to see. The men certainly have majestic bodies and lively spirits, and the women also show healthy beauty and active innocence. They walk with their chests straight and their steps brisk. Those who are hunched over, stooped, and pale are rarely seen. Women also do not have delicate and weak postures. They allow their bodies to develop naturally and strive to promote natural beauty. Only a very small number of people wear makeup, or they are simply prostitutes. Therefore, many people say that German women are too fat and not very good-looking, just because they do not decorate themselves. German children also develop extremely fast. Children of thirteen or fourteen years old are almost as big as our adults. I remember once one of our teammates ran to the men's department of a certain department store to buy underwear of size 32. The clerk politely said to him, "Sir, I'm sorry, please go to the children's department to buy it. The underwear in the adult department here is at least size 36." From this, we can deduce their tall physique. "A sound mind dwells in a sound body." With a sound mind, one can accomplish great things. We ask ourselves that our average physique is indeed too refined.</p>
<p>(3) Punctuality</p>
<p>Punctuality is the first creed of Germans in dealing with the world. I have made appointments with many German friends, and I have never seen them break their appointments or be late. Several times, we wanted to take a special car to the stadium for practice, but we were three or two minutes late, and the car was nowhere to be seen. Later, we negotiated and got a good lesson in return. The person in charge of the vehicles said, "Our cars are driven to the designated locations to be punctual. We are not driven there to wait for people." He meant that if a car was waiting there overtime, it would block the traffic behind and disrupt the entire order. Later, we had to make appointments in advance, willing to go earlier to wait for the car to arrive. No matter what kind of meeting or dinner, no one will wait if you are late. If we use Chinese-style time to respond to people's dinners, I am afraid you will enter the door and people will have already dispersed. This is the biggest problem of our people. Their habit of keeping time without favoritism is what we should emulate most.</p>
<p>(4) Orderliness</p>
<p>Orderliness is also one of the virtues of Germans. During this conference, the population of Berlin suddenly surged, but whether in the station, in the theater, in the restaurant, in the stadium, or at the ticket office, although it was extremely crowded, there was no chaos. The orderliness does not require police to guide or oppress. People on the street shoulder to shoulder, everyone is extremely rule-abiding. You cannot cross the road randomly from the street side. To cross the road, you must first stand at the intersection and wait for the signal before you can walk. Otherwise, you will be fined if the police see it. Especially at the entrance of the ticket office, the order is truly envious. They wait in lines quietly for their turn to come, never rushing to get ahead, taking advantage of others, or rushing ahead. This order in public places is also what our people neglect.</p>
<p>(5) Universal Education</p>
<p>Almost all Germans are literate. No matter whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, at the very least, they can read newspapers, and six or seven out of ten can understand English. We do not feel the trouble of language barrier when we live in Germany. It is said that they also learn English, French, or Latin in middle school. Their level of education can be speculated. Because they know books, they know etiquette. They are always polite and helpful to foreigners who ask questions. When we first arrived in Berlin and stepped on the underground tram, we did not know where to go. Our helpless and poor state was seen by an old man sitting next to us. He even began to ask us where we wanted to go and agreed to lead us very piously. When we said goodbye and thanked him, I curiously asked him if he was going the same way. He said, "My own destination has passed three stations, but it doesn't matter. In ten minutes, I can go back there." They respect foreign guests like this. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rise and Fall Swiftly and Greatly</h3>
<p>Last week (September 28th to October 3rd), the market price changes of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange in a week were turbulent and fluctuated extremely greatly, making it one of the weeks with the greatest changes in recent months. However, the current situation is not　considered frightening because of occasional military actions in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. Once it breaks out, there is a danger of it getting out of control. The market soared due to short covering, and it was even higher than last week. The number of accounts has greatly increased, and if there are fluctuations, it should be　. Last week, Monday was the closing date for September futures and the market was closed. On Tuesday, the Hongkou incident intensified, and rumors spread. The Northern Gang, 16, and 47, etc., all fell, slightly by a corner to seven corners. Type A even rose by a corner. Wednesday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market was closed again for a day. On Thursday, the situation in Hongkou was extremely tense, and rumors became more knowledgeable. The bearish wind gradually became stronger, falling by one yuan to one yuan and eight and a half corners. On Friday, the surface situation in the local area seemed more moderate, but the underlying crisis was even more severe due to facts such as no guarantee of military insurance and no acceptance of loan mortgages. However, short covering and retail investors going long became lively, suddenly improving by half a yuan to one yuan and three and a half corners. On Saturday, the news was dull. Both the bulls and bears had different opinions on Sangdao's mission to China, and they were quite contradictory. In the end, due to the purchase of No. 4, 32, 53, and retail investors, the rising wind was　even stronger than before, rising again by seven or eight corners to more than one and a half yuan. The amount purchased by buyers in the two days was approximately between 44 million and 50 million. The short　side has gradually turned into the long side. Therefore, according to the market price results, it actually rose by two corners to seven corners compared to last week. The total turnover was 69.21 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American and Indian Cotton Fall Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to spot merchants selling and bulls liquidating. Spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 6 to 8 points. Spot prices for English cotton fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 4 points. Indian cotton initially had inquiries from industry and retail investors, but later, old bulls turned to selling and short covering. The closing price was stable as they offset each other. The average price fell by 0.25, Omra fell by 1 rupee, and Bai Luoxi fell by 0.75. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th electricity).</p>

<h3>Grain: River Rice Slightly Recovers and Finds an Outlet</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various guilds arrived with more activity than before, totaling thirty-two or three vessels, carrying six thousand four or five hundred *shi* of grain. The local market suddenly turned sluggish again. The bundled *da* Qingdao grain variety amounted to four or five hundred bundles, causing people to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, leading to very few transactions for *zhong bai ge* and *hou xin jing* varieties. As a result, prices for *zhong* grains dropped by three to four *jiao*, *bai ge* by half to two *jiao*, and *xin jing* by two to three *jiao*. *Du yang* and other new superior varieties followed suit, dropping by three *chi*. Judging by the current trend, it is difficult to establish a stable price. *Chen yuan* also showed weakness, with *xin yin yuan* further reduced by more than two *chi*.</p>

<h3>Seafood: Fresh Squid from Autumn Waters is Popular</h3>
<p>Fresh Squid: The first batch of hot water squid was not abundant, but the second batch from autumn waters has been caught in increasing quantities. Arrivals in the local market have gradually surged, and prices have correspondingly declined. Yesterday, the board opened with large autumn water high-quality squid at a price of seventy-four yuan, uniform slices at seventy-two yuan and a half to seventy-one yuan, oily slices at sixty-eight yuan, and second-grade *dui zhou* squid at sixty-eight yuan, down to sixty-four yuan. Jinshan squid is scarce and unavailable on the market.</p>
<p>Dried Octopus: Mountain vendors are still reluctant to sell their goods. Traders do not have ample stock, so the market is tight. Currently, *ning ti da* is selling for forty-eight yuan, high-grade thirty-eight or nine yuan, ordinary thirty-seven yuan, rain-soaked thirty-five yuan, northern octopus selected large sixty yuan, standard grade fifty-six or seven yuan, small slices fifty yuan. Both arrivals and stock are becoming scarce.</p>
<p>Dried Silverfish: Good quality silverfish from Tangkou are sold for seventy-eight yuan, but they are now sold out. *Zhong zhuang yan gan* is currently priced at fifty-five or six yuan, but sources are also scarce, and the market remains firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Over Seven Hundred Bags of Green and Red Sugar Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend was stable. The guild's listed prices for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar, *dong bai*, and *ben mian bai* remained largely unchanged. Trading was limited. The market board was more active, with Chaozhou opening with a total of over seven hundred bags of *mian chi* and *fan chi* sugars. For example, Songfa red sugar, seventy-nine bags, opened at fifteen yuan and seven *jiao*; Xieshun red sugar, thirty-nine bags, at ten yuan and eight *jiao*; Zhangli red sugar, thirty-five bags, at fourteen yuan and nine *jiao*; Rongxing red sugar, one hundred and twenty bags, at fourteen yuan and seven *jiao*; and Tianyuanji secondary red sugar, one hundred and thirty bags, at thirteen yuan and four *jiao*. Huanggang green goods were more common, with a price of fourteen yuan and five *fen*, totaling two hundred and twenty bags traded.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Quanzhou Soaked Round Goods – Owners Unwilling to Sell Cheaply Due to High Costs… Agency Receives Telegram</h3>
<p>Although the amount of Quanzhou soaked round goods arriving on the Yongsheng vessel the day before yesterday seemed substantial, investigations revealed that costs were not low. It is reported that due to buyers offering unreasonably low prices, which would result in losses, the agency received a telegram from Quanzhou cargo owners stating that those producing goods are firmly holding out and refusing to sell cheaply, anticipating a future shortage of goods, and that those shipping to Shanghai are insisting on their prices and must not unload at low prices.</p>

<h3>Clarifying the Importance of Sexual Love Between Genders</h3>
<p>…Spiritual love between husband and wife is far inferior to the wholesome harmony of sexual love…If sexual love is incomplete, it is difficult to avoid sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, and a good marriage can turn into a marriage of resentment.</p>
<p>In the past, when wives were treated as mere playthings, delicate and frail beauties were naturally welcomed. But times have changed: women should have considerable activity, be able to raise children at home, and also be supporters and encouragers of men externally. Naturally, the standards for choosing a wife have also changed—from beauty of appearance to beauty of health. This trend is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon. This is certainly an inevitable trend arising from adapting to the demands of nature, but it is also not necessarily an accurate result obtained from personal experience.</p>
<p>In fact, healthy beauty (superior to beauty of appearance) is the most important element between husband and wife—it enables complete reproduction, and the couple can grow old together. Harmonious relations between husband and wife are undoubtedly based on sexual love, so both parties cannot underestimate it. To make the sexual love between husband and wife fulfilling, the prerequisite is that both parties must be physically healthy and have complete sexual function. Only then can true love between husband and wife occur, and there will be no worries about not being able to produce healthy offspring in the future.</p>
<p>Although spiritual love is also indispensable between husband and wife, according to research by famous Western scholars, spiritual love is merely an appendage of sexual love. If sexual love is incomplete, then spiritual love cannot be consistent either. These are truly insightful words!</p>
<p>Indeed, if every couple could have healthy sexual love, then not only would they be as affectionate as glue and as happy as fish in water, but also the nation's race would not find it difficult to reach an excellent standard. Especially in the early stages of marriage, this defect of incomplete sexual love is more likely to occur. It is common to see that before the honeymoon period has passed, the woman files for separation because the man's sexual love is incomplete. No matter how deep your spiritual love may be, the result will still be sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Unless you are aware of the harm and treat it well, you can grow old together.</p>
<p>The fundamental causes of incomplete sexual love, on the man's side: (1) infertility and incomplete development, short penis; (2) premature ejaculation and impotence. On the woman's side: (1) the wife suffers from frigidity; (2) genital abnormalities; (3) incomplete development, atrophied breasts.</p>
<p>Now, let's explain them one by one. Incomplete development in both men and women, apart from being due to congenital physical weakness, is mostly due to the influence of excessive masturbation. If spermatorrhea lasts too long, all metabolic functions cease. In addition, impotence and premature ejaculation are common phenomena in those with neurasthenia. Premarital masturbation and gonorrhea are important causes of contracting this condition. German famous venereologist Dr. Westcott, based on many years of practical experience, confirmed that the most reliable therapy is the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Element," which can restore perfect and strong development, fundamentally cure neurasthenia, and permanently eliminate impotence and premature ejaculation. Those suffering from spermatorrhea should be treated with "Hemitol's Semen Strengthening Pills." If the cause is due to gonorrhea, then the combination of yellow pigment and vaccine "Antilymph" is a specific and effective drug for the symptoms. Mr. Westcott once used the above methods to cure a maximum of 2,774 people with incomplete sexual love and a minimum of 1,051 people in one month. This method is recognized by physicians around the world. Dr. Tusore of the United States also used "Reproductive Element," "Antilymph," and "Hemitol's Semen Strengthening Pills" in March 1935 to cure the same symptoms in as many as 4,019 people, almost doubling Mr. Westcott's number, so Mr. Westcott's record is really not worth mentioning. (Editor's note: Genuine Reproductive Element Semen Strengthening Pills are generally packaged in iron boxes, be careful not to purchase counterfeit products in paper boxes)</p>
<p>Experiences in Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>The Latest Popular Method of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Is characterized by safety and effectiveness. It is good news for those who find quitting smoking unbearably painful.</p>
<p>In this era of scientific prosperity, everything is more advanced than in the 19th century. Taking quitting smoking as an example, in the past, racking one's brains to quit was indeed not an easy task. Imagine a person with many illnesses who relies entirely on the anesthesia of opium to function. The addiction to smoke is deep. If you want to force him to quit suddenly, it is even more difficult than taking his life. This is because every nerve has been poisoned by the smoke. If one does not smoke and the endocrine system in the reproductive glands is extremely depleted, the source of life loses its protection and resistance. There is no reason not to suffer from a hundred diseases. Therefore, some smokers want to quit but dare not quit, simply because of this reason. However, the 20th century is a scientific world, so there is no need to worry. The latest popular method of quitting smoking involves supplementing the body; governments around the world use it to help smokers quit, and its implementation is very simple. Just administer large amounts of the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" and inject "You Weici Bao" to promote the health of the reproductive glands, enhance resistance to the poison of smoke and the intrusion of external diseases. In less than two months, one can safely quit without any pain. There was once a Liang Jiemin, 40 years old, from Guangdong. He started smoking due to a stomach illness and had been addicted for nearly 20 years. He had repeatedly tried to quit, but always failed because he could not endure the pain. After I used the supplementation method to help him quit, administering "Reproductive Element" for more than a month and injecting "You Weici Bao Ming" at the same time, he safely quit, and his body gradually became stronger, which was beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>Foreign Medical News</p>
<h3>Scientific Remediation for Women with Flat Breasts</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Soviet scholar Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, an authority in the international physiological community, translated by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>…The development of breasts is a major condition for health and beauty…Scholars from various countries are engaged in hard work on obstetrics and gynecology with advanced skills…More than 100,000 women with flat breasts in London have achieved health and beauty.</p>
<p>Since modern people have changed their concept of beauty and value healthy beauty, the previously weak constitution of women has been completely overturned. The conditions for female health and beauty include several points, such as the relationship between weight and height, the health of muscle tissue, the plumpness of posture, and the development of the chest and buttocks. These points are indispensable for those seeking health and beauty. However, these few points cannot be called the main conditions. The most important authority in female healthy beauty is the breasts. If the breasts can be high and firm, and elastic and solid, not only will the curves be fully exposed and the beautiful posture fully displayed, but also the foundation of a woman's health will be exceptionally solid. Dr. Grasol M.D., the most famous physiologist in the United States, had an article in 1934 entitled "The Evolution of Female Healthy Beauty," which not only described the necessity of female healthy beauty but also provided detailed proof of the methods for developing breasts. Experts such as Russian beauty expert Sanine, American beauty expert Dr. Milo Hasting M.D., British famous medical doctor Sophie Lapazafelder, and German physiologist Lrpicque all unanimously recognized that the atrophy and flatness of women's breasts are entirely related to the weakening of the reproductive glands. Therefore, their research on the use of gonadal hormone preparations has not been a matter of a day or two. It was not until 1932 that Austrian physiologist Staner received government funding and invented the truly pure gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" for women, that a reliable medicine for flat breasts was found. After several international scholars mentioned above experimented with it, Staner's name soared, and European and American scholars unanimously praised him as an international physiological master. Governments of various countries have successively awarded him certificates of merit because this drug not only promotes development but also has significant effects on female menstrual disorders and infertility. It is estimated that in London alone, 16,745 women with flat breasts, infertility, and menstrual abnormalities were cured with this preparation in 1935 alone.</p>
<h3>Reliable Short-Term Cure for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The harm of gonorrhea to the human body is indeed more severe than that of syphilis. If infected with gonorrhea, it can lead to prostatitis, orchitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, arthritis, cystitis, and fallopian tube blockage, leading to the extinction of offspring. Regarding reliable treatments, based on the clinical experience of the world's most famous venereal disease experts such as British gonorrhea scholar Plom o, German famous medical doctor C. Darrow M.D., and French venereal disease expert Dr. E. Laurent, who obtained their experience from 5,000 gonorrhea treatments, it is confirmed that the components of various gonorrhea drugs that can meet the ideal efficacy are best found in the combination of yellow pigment and vaccine "Antilymph." The three experts jointly conducted trials, and among 5,000 patients, those treated with "Antilymph" accounted for as many as 4,095, and there is a very detailed ratio table published in the German Lhe Venereal Diseases. Due to the limitations of the publication's space, we cannot publish it all, but only a small part for reference.</p>

<p>The Evils of Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient Chen Xuan Yuan, 26 years old, from Jining, Shandong, complains—When he reached puberty at the age of 15, his genitals gradually opened, and he searched and collected countless pornographic materials, reading them morning and night, even neglecting food and drink. Further induced by bad friends, he began masturbating and then suffered from nocturnal emission after quitting, which has not healed to this day. He is thin and weak, has poor memory, suffers from insomnia, dizziness, and is confused all day long. He experiences lower back pain, and is filled with suffering. His development has been hindered, and his genitals are extremely small. He plans to get married this year and is extremely worried, requesting a quick cure. Medical history—When he first started masturbating, he only knew the momentary pleasure, but he did not expect that the habit would become natural. He would masturbate once every night. Soon after, he felt distracted and had more wet dreams. Three years later, he suddenly felt his face thin and his spirit unsustainable. At that time, he had gained some knowledge and knew that it would endanger his life. He quit in horror, but nocturnal emission kept occurring. At first, he only had four or five wet dreams a month, but later it turned into spermatorrhea, eventually occurring once a day. As a result, a hundred diseases arose, and he became extremely weak. Current symptoms—loose sperm gate, sexual neurasthenia and numbness, reproductive glands damaged beyond repair. Treatment—Implementing a fundamental treatment, first administering the semen-strengthening medicine "Hemitol's Semen Strengthening Pills" to treat nocturnal emission and calm the nerves, then administering "Reproductive Element" to supplement the consumed essence and assist development. At the same time, electrical therapy and surgery are performed to restore the sexual nerves to their normal state. After two months of treatment, nocturnal emission disappeared, his body recovered, and his development was sufficient.</p>
<p>Remedy for Premature Aging</p>
<p>Patient Wu Haoqiu, 32 years old, local, complains—Because my family was very poor when I was young, I never paid attention to nutrition, and I helped the elders with their work, which hindered my development. I suffered from spermatorrhea at the age of 17. At first, I didn't know its name, but later, due to occasional labor or excessive thinking, I would have nocturnal emission every night, so I knew it was definitely not a good sign. I got married at the age of 19 and have been running around for food and clothing for more than ten years. Spermatorrhea has not stopped, and what is even more disheartening is that my temples are graying and thinning, and my complexion is pale and sallow. I experience lower back pain, discomfort in my limbs, kidney deficiency, night sweats, and mental weakness. I have aged prematurely, looking like someone in their fifties, and I am extremely ashamed. I request treatment. Current symptoms—Weak reproductive glands, endocrine imbalance. Treatment—In addition to performing electrical therapy and surgery, administer a large amount of "Reproductive Element" to restore healthy reproductive glands, and take "Hemitol's Semen Strengthening Pills" to treat spermatorrhea. After about 50 days of treatment, the face became visibly active, especially the cheeks became rosy, the hair as black as ink, the body robust, and all signs of aging disappeared.</p>
<p>Help My Development</p>
<p>Mr. Liu from No. 52, Beida Street, Yuhua, Zhejiang, writes: "After two years of masturbation, my development was destroyed. My body and genitals are as small as a child's. As a man in his twenties, I feel ashamed. Later, introduced by a friend, I obtained five boxes of "Reproductive Element" and took them orally according to the instructions. After a month, various parts showed full development, especially in the ability to perform sexually. It is truly a good medicine."</p>
<p>Stomach Pain Cured</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Yuanlong from Jixing Store, West Gate Street, Yuanmou County, Yunnan, writes: "I have suffered from stomach pain for nearly five years, and repeated treatments have been ineffective. Later, I asked a friend in Shanghai to buy three bottles each of "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Element." After taking them, the pain stopped immediately, my appetite increased, I ate without indigestion, and there was no acid reflux or hiccups. Moreover, it has not recurred for three months, and I feel incomparably grateful."</p>
<p>Good Medicine for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Ms. Lu Jieru from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, writes: "I accidentally fell ill last year, and leukorrhea suddenly appeared in my lower body. Afterward, my body became weaker, the flow became greater, and red blood appeared. Fortunately, my husband bought back a medicine called "Leukorrhea Relief" for external use, and I took "Reproductive Element for Women" internally. In less than a month, the leukorrhea disappeared completely, and my body recovered its health. It is truly a good medicine for women, and I recommend it to my fellow sufferers."</p>
<p>Bone Pain Does Not Recur</p>
<p>Manager Zhang from Yucheng Grain Store, Beijie Street, Jianglu, Sichuan, writes: "I am 52 years old and have suffered from bone pain for 20 years, but living in a remote and backward area, I could not find good doctors or medicines, so I have not been cured. Fortunately, introduced by my relative Mr. Shen, I took "Strong Stone Bone Pain Pills." After finishing three bottles, the pain disappeared suddenly. It has not recurred for half a year. It is truly a star among bone pain medicines, and I am extremely grateful for its unparalleled efficacy."</p>
<p>Common Sense About Bone Pain</p>
<h3>Bone Pain Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Ninety-nine out of one hundred elderly people suffer from bone pain. To seek effective treatment, one should follow the correct path of medicine.</p>
<p>Bone pain is inextricably linked to the elderly because they often do not care about excessive labor and the ravages of wind and fire in their youth. As a result, they accumulate day after day. When they become old and weak, the labor injuries and rheumatism that have eroded their bones slowly penetrate the bones. When the weather changes or during festivals and labor, the pain does not fail to make you ache and feel numb, especially in the limbs and back. The pain is even more severe. Moreover, those who indulged in promiscuity when they were young, planting the residual poison of venereal disease, with unclean blood and internal blood toxins, can also cause bone pain, which is more painful and difficult to treat than bone pain caused by excessive labor. Therefore, when people reach old age, ninety-nine out of one hundred cannot avoid this kind of pain. Suffering from it not only causes pain but also a hundred inconveniences.</p>
<p>Since the "Strong Stone Bone Pain Pills" were introduced to the world, bone pain that was difficult to treat in the past can now be quickly cured without any problems. Whether it is bone pain in the elderly or young, rheumatic bone pain, joint pain, lower back pain, all kinds of pain and numbness disappear with the medicine.</p>
<p>Patient Liu Fuming, who suffered from bone pain for more than ten years, experienced pain every one of the twenty-four solar terms throughout the year, which was difficult to endure. He had tried almost all medical treatments, but the pain did not decrease at all. After I introduced him to "Strong Stone Bone Pain Pills," he took four bottles, and the bone pain not only healed, but his limbs were also light and healthy, better than when he was young.</p>

<h3>Male Masturbation During Puberty</h3>
<p>— (German Medical Doctor Zhang Junshi)</p>
<p>Generally, boys who have reached puberty and young people whose reproductive functions have fully developed engage in masturbation, but the degree of harm varies. Those who are excessively addicted to masturbation inevitably suffer from pathological spermatorrhea. Neurasthenia then breaks out one after another.</p>
<p>The reason why spermatorrhea causes disease is that the main components of human semen are proteins, fats, inorganic salts, and other solid components. The source of these solid components is manufactured and supplied by the testicles. Through the action of the epididymis, they are discharged from the vas deferens and stored in the seminal vesicles. If spermatorrhea is excessive, and masturbation or sexual activity is excessive, the semen will be consumed, and the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system will gradually be depleted, leading to neurasthenia and symptoms such as incomplete development, impotence, and premature ejaculation. Treatment is of course a matter that cannot be delayed. Regarding the medicinal treatment of spermatorrhea, according to famous venereal disease experts in various countries such as Marinkes and William Ke, it must start with strengthening semen and supplementing the body, using "Hemitol's Semen Strengthening Pills" to stop spermatorrhea, and using the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" to supplement all the severe neurasthenia caused by spermatorrhea. When I was in Berlin and after returning to China, I used this preparation to cure many patients with spermatorrhea, so its effectiveness is recognized worldwide.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Junren)</p>
<p>October 10th comes once a year. Double Ten National Day, comes once a year. We all know: a country is composed of many societies; a society is composed of many families. Without families, there would be no society. Without society, there would be no country. Therefore, if we want to celebrate the National Day, we must first have society and families, and there must be something to celebrate before we can do so. But unfortunately, the evil disease of economic depression has spread everywhere. Just taking Shanghai as an example, which store is not saving expenses and reducing staff? All day long, shouting until their throats are sore, they still have no customers. On that road, how few shops have closed down? If Shanghai is like this, we can know how it is elsewhere. If society is like this, the suffering in families is naturally unavoidable!</p>
<p>Since November last year, the government changed to using legal tender and issued an order. As a result, many banks that issued currencies that were not legal tender greatly laid off employees after the New Year. According to rumors, China Industrial, counting all locations, had more than 300 people. If all companies were combined, the number would definitely be shocking. In this year of extreme industrial and commercial decline, where do so many unemployed people go to find a way out, where do they go to find a job! Their families may have fallen into a very terrible abyss because of their unemployment. Alas! If families are like this, if society is like this, what is there to celebrate in the country!</p>
<h3>A Traveler Returned From Xinjiang Speaks</h3>
<p>— Zhengming</p>
<p>Because of the long distance and inconvenient transportation, Xinjiang, far in the borderlands, is like Tibet, and has long been a desolate place.</p>
<p>Recently, I met a certain gentleman who just returned from Xinjiang. He has been practicing medicine there for a long time. What he talks about are all real situations he has heard and seen. From his conversation, we can learn something about the recent situation of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The gentleman stayed in Dihua the longest, and went to Hami once. He also traveled to many other places. According to him, Xinjiang is currently quite peaceful and there are no wars. However, the cost of living is very high, and the sharp rise and fall of currency prices have added to the difficulties of ordinary people's lives. In terms of the currency system, the tael system is still generally used. In April last year, a local dollar was worth about one tael and five qian. The prices of all daily necessities, from rice to dry grass, are very expensive. The small house the gentleman lived in initially required a rent of 700 taels a year, and was only reduced to 300 taels from last year. However, although the rent is so expensive, because Dihua is the provincial capital and the number of residents is constantly increasing, it has created a phenomenon where there are not enough houses. This is also a reason for the high rent.</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been a large number of Soviet people residing in Xinjiang Province. Most of them are engaged in teaching, mechanical engineering, pilot technology, and specialist teaching. Russians who are not Soviet citizens have become increasingly depressed and may be in a desperate situation in the province.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, Soviet expatriates have established several hospitals. In February last year, they built a Soviet military hospital. The gentleman worked in the hospital and received generous compensation and was not treated differently. The medical and health undertakings in Xinjiang Province have now taken shape.</p>
<p>The provincial capital, Dihua, has been working hard on all transportation construction recently, and it has adopted modernization. The number of cars is increasing day by day, and buses have become the most applicable means of transportation. There are now buses available from Dihua to various suburbs or other major cities, and the difficulty of traveling is decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>The police force has also adopted modern organization, and it is organized very well and tightly. They are responsible for maintaining traffic and ensuring public security. Recently, because the situation on the border is becoming tense, the police have been ordered to pay close attention to a group of suspicious foreigners, such as British and those who look like spies from a certain country. At the same time, the September 18th Incident has indeed left a great lesson in the hearts of the people of Xinjiang. They are concerned about the situation in the country, and they are all eager to see the revival of the motherland!</p>
<h3>Ms. Zeng</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>On Monday morning, a new female staff member came to our office. She was already over thirty years old, and her clothes were even more simple and unadorned. But when she spoke, it was full of worldly experience. Her employment this time was a selection of true talent from more than thirty male and female applicants, and the work in that position was very heavy, so colleagues, on the contrary, did not take her lightly and regard her as a vase.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in an unintentional conversation with her, I discovered that her life experience was shocking enough. She is the Ms. Zeng we mentioned. Her frankness really made any of our colleagues feel inferior. She said that she was originally the daughter of a farmer. At the age of seven, she was sold by her parents to Shanghai to be a slave because of years of famine. Because she was too young, her impression of her parents was very vague. The mistress treated her really badly, forcing her to work to death every day, not giving her enough to eat, not giving her enough sleep, and she had to be beaten every day. At the age of seventeen, she was taken by the master as a concubine.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, the master died. The mistress did not tolerate her, and the cruel mistress, accumulating resentment for three or four years, actually sold her into a brothel that specialized in receiving foreign sailors. In four years, she was taken by the madam and traveled all over Shantou, Hong Kong, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Weihai, Yantai, and Shanghai. Ten years ago, she met a foreign soldier who took pity on her and generously redeemed her, and also arranged for her to go to a girls' school and ordered her to receive education. All education, accommodation and other expenses were paid by the foreign soldier. Because the foreign soldier's surname, translated, sounds like the character "Zeng," so she was considered to be surnamed Zeng.</p>
<p>She attended the school for two years of remedial classes, entered middle school, and studied for another six years, obtaining a diploma from a senior high school. During these eight years, the foreign soldier came to China three times, each time giving her a lot of money. Coincidentally, when she participated in the graduation exam, the bad news of the foreign soldier's death suddenly came. She graduated in the summer of the year before last. At that time, she was already thirty-two years old. She couldn't find a job for a while, so she went to a dance hall to work as a dancer. Because she was too old, no one was interested in her, so after three months, she applied to a company as a salesperson. This time, knowing that there was a clerk exam here, she came to apply.</p>
<p>She said, "I am a person who has suffered, and I will end my life in the vocational world in the future."</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Clam Season</h3>
<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>Not far from my hometown, the land is near the coast, and most of the villagers fish, dry salt, and raise clams.</p>
<p>In early spring, they prepare a sum of money, buy clam seedlings from other places, and start seeding; large households put six or seven loads, and small households put two or three loads.</p>
<p>By early autumn, the clams are very fat, and that is their clam harvesting season.</p>
<p>When the morning mist is hazy and the breeze is gentle, the river is filled with milky white. They go to the clam fields with their children to pick clams. After picking a few baskets, they slowly return.</p>
<p>Clams live in the mud, and it is not easy to pick them if you are not familiar with this way. When the morning tide first recedes, the mud is as smooth as a mirror. The clam lives in the mud, with its two feet pointing upwards. The tip of its foot has a small hole, which is also its breathing tube. Water is discharged from this tip from time to time, so there are also two small holes on the mud. Clam pickers can find them by following the small holes.</p>
<p>These clams are mostly supplied to the urban middle class to change their taste. People in our hometown do not buy them for no reason.</p>
<p>That place is more than seventy miles away from the city, and thirty miles are dry roads, and all are in towering mountains. So, transporting clams is done by human labor.</p>
<p>In the early autumn midnight, the quiet street in front of our door is filled with talking all night long. Even on rainy nights, this sound has never stopped.</p>
<p>Most of those who carry clams are not vendors. They are those who seed themselves. In the past, they relied on a broken boatyard and a few squares of clam fields left by their ancestors, and they could live a warm and full life. Now it is not as good as before, and bankrupt fishing villages can be seen everywhere.</p>
<h3>Hunan People's Special Preference</h3>
<p>— (Delin)</p>
<p>Hunan people's love of spicy food is second to none in China.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, after washing up, they drink "pepper and salt soup" made of boiled water mixed with pepper and salt. There are also thin slices of fresh leaves, pickled, and then dried in the sun. This is a dish treated the same as "pepper and salt soup" in the morning. Other condiments such as chili peppers are also their only gift. In ordinary households in the local area, they usually split open fresh red chili peppers, remove the seeds, pickle them with salt, and put them in jars to meet the needs of times when crops are not yet ready.</p>
<p>As for the ways to eat chili peppers, there are many. They like to add spicy flavors to ordinary vegetables, fresh meat, or snacks such as noodles. Even at banquets, every dish is cooked with spicy flavors, and a lot of chili powder is placed in soy sauce dishes. People from Jiangsu and Zhejiang will definitely click their tongues when they see this kind of eating method. But they enjoy it, which is a special hobby of Hunan people. The "heroic nature of the people" in Hunan Province is probably due to the stimulation of the spicy taste!</p>

<h3>Brief Account of Tang Sculptures</h3>
<p>— (Lin Liqin)</p>
<p>Indian Buddhism flowed into China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Later Han Dynasty, and flourished at the end of the Jin Dynasty. By the Tang Dynasty, due to widespread propaganda and in-depth research, temples were erected in forests, even more than in previous dynasties. And the art of sculpture, which is attached to crafts, also developed dramatically due to the prosperity of Buddhism, and gradually became a unique art. In the Tang Dynasty, the sculptor called Yang Huizhi was from the Yuan and Zhong years of Kaiyuan. Yang initially studied painting with Wu Daozi and Zhang Sengyao. Their skills were equally remarkable, but Daozi's reputation was more prominent. Yang was angry, so he burned his pens and inkstones and changed to studying sculpture, and finally became famous in the world. His surviving works recorded in the records include Anyue Temple, Guangshou Temple, Lengjia Mountain, and other places, but unfortunately, they have all disappeared. The Heavenly King statues in Kunshan Juju Temple were also sculpted by Yang; the maids on both sides were as beautiful as fairies, and they were especially masterpieces. Song scholar Xu Lin once wrote an article to warn future generations not to allow reckless modifications. Later, they were indeed rebuilt by vulgar craftsmen, and the original intention was lost. Scholars regretted it! During the Hongyang Rebellion, the temple was also destroyed. Therefore, Huizhi's surviving works, since Hongyang, more than seventy years ago, have been almost unknown. Until the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Gu Jiegang and Chen Wanli, two gentlemen of the country, accidentally came to Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi Town, Kunshan, Wuxian County, and discovered incomplete wall sculptures and dilapidated eighteen Arhat statues among the broken walls and rubble, recognizing them as Huizhi's works; after further investigation and research by Japanese scholar Omura Saiyachi, he determined that the wall sculptures were Huizhi's original works, and the Arhats had been modified and had lost their original appearance; thanks to the maintenance and promotion by Ye Xia'an, Shen Bohan, and other gentlemen, they were able to be preserved, so that the art works of 1,200 years ago would not be destroyed by wind and rain in the wilderness, but were revealed today; this is truly a great merit in the art world, and the immortality of its achievements is certainly no less than that of scholar Xu.</p>
<p>Changguo Temple is located in Yanling Town, thirty-five miles south of Danyang County in our county. The appearance is magnificent, and the Guiyu is majestic; it is a pity that it has been in disrepair for a long time and is gradually becoming dilapidated. According to the county records: the eighteen Arhats in the temple were sculpted by Liu Yin of the Tang Dynasty. Changguo Temple was first built in the second year of the Jin Dynasty Taikang era; it was rebuilt in the early years of the Tang Dynasty Dazhong era. The temple has an ancient bell, which was cast in the Kaiyuan era. Later, during the Jiayou era of the Song Dynasty; and the Yongle and Jiajing eras of the Ming Dynasty; it was only repaired, and the old appearance was not changed. There is a monument inscription by Mi Yuanzhang in the Song Dynasty. The Arhats in the temple should still be the old sculptures of the Tang Dynasty; however, the name of Liu Yin is not seen in historical records. He may be an unknown artist, but judging from the year of reconstruction and the time of casting the bell, the sculptor must have been a figure of the Tang Dynasty, and there is no guilt. It is a pity that it is located in a remote and dilapidated place, and it has not been appreciated and commented by contemporary sages and heroes, so that the ancient objects of more than a thousand years have been buried and not revealed, and only enjoyed the worship of foolish men and women. If the saying that the old sculptures of the Tang Dynasty is not a fixed tripod, will it not be compared with the Tang sculptures of Jiaozhi in the world? My maternal grandfather, Dong Gong Yunqing, was proficient in the calligraphy of the Nanguan style because of his family learning. During the Qing Dynasty, he rebuilt the temple, and the plaque of the Mahavira Hall hanging in the main hall was written by him. In addition, the county chronicles also record two myths: please note that the true bodies of the eighteen Arhats of Changguo Temple came from Tiantai, and they sculpted each other to form their images, facing each other as if alive. There is a mud dragon coiled on the rafters. During the summer and autumn rains, when thunder and lightning strike, the old monk will beat the drum to help it with the heavenly dragon. It is also said that there is a dragon-subduing Arhat among the Arhats. The monks in the temple dreamed at night that the dragon said: Tonight, the heavenly dragon will come to fight with me, and you can help me with three drumbeats. The monk suddenly realized and suddenly heard strong winds rising; thunder and lightning flashed. The next day, he looked up at the mud dragon, its claws were dripping with water; and its body was covered with algae. There is a deep pond on the side of the temple, now called Jiaotang. The monks were afraid and nailed it with wooden nails. These are just vulgar stories of the people of Qi. Gentlemen do not speak of them. I have included them here, just to amuse the readers and use them as conversation material.</p>

<h3>Boat Girls of Wusong</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhen</p>
<p>For the beauty of climbing, mountains are not as good as water. Waxed shoes seek seclusion, and going through dangerous places requires those who are physically fit; the old, weak, and tired are not suitable for it. If the river is empty, the wind is calm, the slight waves do not rise, a gentle oar sound, the moon is as bright as washing, the butterfly soul wants to transform, and a light coolness floats around, without having to trek, and the unrestrained interest flows freely. This is why Zhang Zhihe wants to grow old in the misty waves. However, short oars chasing the wind should have woodcutters speaking intimately, with their eyes like moonlit waves, with their songs and oar sounds sending messages beyond the dust. Perhaps the lakes and mountains can be touched at a moment's notice, and they will communicate because of this. The zither can be emotional, and the mirror flowers can fall in disorder. Otherwise, the sound of the flute at the Red Cliff will ultimately feel lonely. I have sailed a few times on Yuan Lake, fully enjoying the charm of the boat girls, slowly chewing betel nuts, their laughter like round pearls. I suspect that there is a special interest in this. When they carry dreams in Lanxi, in their full and beautiful form, they further believe that the rivers and mountains and the bamboo slope have not aged. Recently, human affairs have suddenly changed, and all beautiful feelings have been cut off. The romantic affairs of pleasure-seekers only increase in the city; unexpectedly, the Xiao and Qi dynasties have fallen into decline, and the encounters in the halls are pressing. The ancient well has many waves, and everything is for sale. Xin Yu of Runan told me: "You are only shocked by the misty rain of the rivers and mountains, calling it spring. Do you also know that half of the Song waves have something that enters people's dreams?" Upon hearing this, I suddenly rose and followed him. We set out from Lujian Ferry, descended to Yunzao River, passed the Great Bridge, knocked on the door of Xin Yu and six or seven others, turned east to Yuyier Wharf, and stayed at Yanyou Pavilion. We heard a boat with a greasy voice calling from across the river. A boat came with a pole, and a girl at the bow beckoned guests in the waves. Her cicada hair was like a drop of ink, hanging down her shoulders. Her deep eyes faced the wind, her eyebrows seemed to speak, she wore a snow-white silk shirt, black trousers hidden, her round arms bare, tall and graceful, and adding to her beauty of being alone in the mist, she made people drunk. We immediately boarded the boat. The girl stepped forward gracefully, inquired about the route attentively, and after we sat down, looked around. The boat was as small as a small boat, but slightly square. In front, ten people could sit. Wooden mats and short benches were scattered around. We took off our clothes and sat comfortably, leaning lazily. An old woman was steering the oar at the stern, which was quiet and secluded, and my heartstrings were secretly tightened; then, jokes and laughter spread, and all worldly concerns were removed. I asked the old woman's name, and she replied that it was Jin Caixiang. She was born and raised in the misty waves, floating on a boat, without any worldly air. She served us tea with a high pot and large bowls, in a rustic style. After talking for a while, we gradually forgot our manners. The girl was alert and witty to all around, her words were sharp, sometimes she talked freely, sometimes she was angry and silent, often making fun of people unconsciously, and in her gentle reception, she always hit the nail on the head, exhausting the strength of ten people to trap her, but the girl calmly responded, laughing and scolding, and drawing pictures on the green gauze tent, winning every time, and her colleagues were left in awe. We looked at each other in surprise. Although we were in the stronghold of soldiers, we were bold and flexible. The night tide was as fast as arrows, and the small village was swallowed by the river. The boat was turned sideways to welcome the cool air from the east, and there was no one at the wild ferry. The girl smiled, and all sounds disappeared. The subtle fragrance floated, and the color of the moon became whiter, illuminating every strand of hair on the girl's black eyebrows. I remembered Bai Shi's words in the past, that Honghong sang softly with mud. I asked the girl to sing, but she refused. I forced her, and she reluctantly said: "Do you gentlemen not understand the way of singing and harmonizing? My Dong Yi is not in singing, but in harmonizing. If there is singing, what is the use of harmonizing?" A person from Jiangxia was the most exuberant. He raised his voice to sing, but before he finished, the girl glanced at him with contempt, thinking that he had lost his integrity. Everyone chirped like the tide, and the liquor flowed around. We then returned cheerfully. The tide was not calm, and the silver snake was dazzlingly white. In the corner of Yong'an, the lights were like ropes, breaking through the fog. After passing Dachunghua, we sped forward. The tall buildings protruded from the walls. We split open a dough cake and dipped it in rose jam, meat floss, and steamed duck from Yunnan, which the whole boat enjoyed. Then, thirsty again, the girl picked reed stems and asked for porridge, and the ice-cold drink quenched our thirst and refreshed our poetic thoughts. The jade capital was not far away, and a hundred feelings gathered again. I doubted that the azure door was actually the Blue Bridge. According to the boat's rules, customers were not prepared for without a prior arrangement, but if one made a reservation in advance, fresh fish, meat, chicken, duck, and garden vegetables could be collected according to one's wishes. However, the rice was only unhulled rice, the dishes were only fat and fresh, and the way of cooking was very different from that of a book boat. The rustic flavor was valued for its suitability to the taste. Those who are tired of the dust, if they occasionally come to this place, will feel the charm of Xiao Chun, and their bones will be clear, which is not the same as the Qin Huai and Jin Fen.</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>The Unified Method of the European Venereal Disease Medical Community: The Latest Promotion of Gonorrhea Drugs by Centralized Countries</h3>
<p>— Original by Dr. Mwssolini of Belgium, translated by Dr. Chen Zongkun, graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Health administrative agencies jointly expand publicity. The German medical community establishes a combined department to control existing gonorrhea treatments.</p>
<p>Today's Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are all countries that dominate the world with enlightened autocratic regimes. With their centralized political means, they have disciplined everything in the country. Even in medicine, they are gradually entering a strict team. The unification of gonorrhea treatment in the venereal disease field is the most obvious item. Therefore, people with gonorrhea are cheering.</p>
<p>Italy, with its power of Corporativism, ordered the national health authorities to promote the latest effective drugs for gonorrhea. The purpose of this expanded publicity is to enable every male and female patient to know the common sense of drug selection for gonorrhea. At the same time, they revealed the dangers of gonorrhea complications, such as inflammation and swelling of the testicles, epidemic pain in the joints, and lower erosion of women's leukorrhea, and further called on the public to understand that when these complications occur, they must take the only effective gonorrhea drug in modern times. This special effect against淋药 is "Kelingnong" invented by Dr. Biede, which is made of a combination of protein and yellow pigment.</p>
<p>Because Dr. Biede is German, and because many gonorrhea drugs contain yellow pigment that is of poor quality, which has the disadvantages of damaging the stomach and kidneys, the German government agencies and the medical community have specially established a combined department (Ministry of Corporation) to control the current gonorrhea treatment, and to ban them one by one, and singled out "Kelingnong" two medicines. Originally, the yellow pigment contained in "Kelingnong" is not only of pure quality, but also has the help of protein, so it complements each other. If the yellow pigment is not matched with this protein, the effect will not be obvious. The two are indispensable. I (Note: Dr. Mussolnii refers to himself) recently used "Kelingnong" to treat more than 270 male and female patients with gonorrhea and leukorrhea in one month. 150 cases were completely cured within four weeks, and 80 cases were cured within five weeks. These are all chronic patients, such as orchitis, arthritis, and female uterine inflammation and leukorrhea (women also use "Ka Erxuedi" externally to treat leukorrhea). The rest of the acute and mild cases will get better even faster if they take this medicine.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea That Almost Rotted the Penis</h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Another Proof that Gonorrhea Can Cause Infertility</p>
<p>The patient is Mr. Zhou Yuji, 27 years old. Once, after arguing with his wife, he angrily went to a prostitute for pleasure and contracted gonorrhea, but then lost medical treatment and turned chronic. Mr. Zhou still did not pay attention and acted recklessly, drinking heavily and working hard, and the gonorrhea also suddenly changed; urination was already very difficult, but now it was even worse. Each time he urinated, he had to strain before a small amount of urine flowed out, and it was half mixed with pus and blood. After I examined him with a urethral reflector, the urethra was already purulent and ulcerated, and the lesion was very extensive and deeply eroded (as shown in Figure A), and there was a tendency for the penis to rot off. Then, after performing urethral irrigation and disinfection, one way to eliminate residual urine to avoid uremia, and at the same time, I injected "Kelingnong" to reduce inflammation and prevent rot, kill bacteria and relieve pain, so that the lesion gradually shrank. After continuous treatment for three weeks, the lesion did shrink a lot, and the pus was gradually cleared, and the pain completely stopped. After continuing to take it for another two weeks, the lesion was gone and the disease was completely cured. His urethra returned to its original state, leaving no traces of induration, etc. (as shown in Figure B), and he urinated as usual, and ejaculation was not obstructed during intercourse. However, if Mr. Zhou's disease had been delayed for a few more days at the beginning, a section of the penis would have been rotten, but fortunately, he took "Kelingnong" and was saved, so it was fortunate!</p>

<h3>Newest Evaluations of Several Treatments for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Physician Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>(Clinic) Intersection of Sishan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation Hours) 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Reduce Lung Tension to Cause Lesions to Atrophy, Aiding the Tendency to Heal – Based on the Theories of German and French Pulmonary Disease Experts, Concrete Methods Are Proposed</p>
<p>Curing lung disease is indeed not an easy task, because in the past there were simply no effective treatments.  The accelerated progress of the times in the treatment of lung diseases, both in terms of academic theory and practical procedures, has already revealed human miracles.</p>
<p>When I was a professor at Nanyang Medical University, I had already announced this news to the students in my lectures.  They all looked at my face with surprised eyes, and everyone asked me what my theory and treatment for lung disease were at this time?  I remember that I had a very detailed introduction at the time.  Now, due to space limitations, it is better to directly quote the words of French pulmonary disease scholar Professor Rindfleisch M.D.  According to him: "The academic theory of this therapy is to reduce lung tension; due to the relaxation of the diseased lung's own elasticity, the tuberculous lesions atrophy, and the cavities shrink. Those symptoms such as hemoptysis, fever, cough, and purulent sputum are easily resolved. The only drug with this effect is 'Pulmonal,' a drug from Dr. Tome M.D., a Swiss authority. Originally, 'Pulmonal' can reduce the air movement and blood and lymphatic circulation in the diseased lung, so the lungs can be relaxed," and so on.  The doctor spent endless efforts to invent this medicine, and as a result, it was finally invented successfully after thousands of animal experiments.  Dr. Baurund Yuong, the director and deputy director of the German tuberculosis sanatorium, both believe that it is a good medicine for the symptoms of lung disease.  Pulmonary disease experts such as Lindorf Lai from the United States and Gan New Gergel from the United Kingdom all recommend this therapy.  Lindorf Lai has used this drug to cure 86% of severe hemoptysis patients. Most of them can eliminate night sweats, hot flashes, chest pain, etc. within three weeks of taking this drug, and after nine weeks, the sputum will disappear completely.  Using X-rays, the lesions have already shrunk without any trace.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that many lung disease patients also have neurasthenia, such as insomnia, palpitations, and men's spermatorrhea and kidney atrophy, and women's irregular menstruation and leukorrhea. Then, at the same time, men should take "Body-Con" and women should take "Beauty-Woman-Ron."  I, at Shanghai Namping People's Hospital, used this therapy, and after three weeks, the patient's weight increased sharply, his spirit was full, and his complexion was rosy. Therefore, it can be said to be the most advanced treatment in the 20th century.</p>
<h3>Insomnia and Menstrual Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Graduate of Nantong Medical University, Physician Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>What are the causes of both? What are the treatments for both?</p>
<p>Why are insomnia and menstrual difficulties placed in one place? Originally, women with insomnia are mostly weak. In other words, women with menstrual difficulties are also prone to insomnia. Their symptoms are generally mental depression, moodiness, dizziness, and many nightmares at night. As long as there is a slight sound, they immediately wake up, so they often end up sleepless all night. As a result, it affects the irregularity of menstruation, because the sexual nerves are stimulated by this insomnia, and gradually the ovarian function becomes abnormal, so menstruation becomes difficult. Also, because of insomnia and menstrual disorders, malnutrition leads to anemia and premature weakness.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to treat this disease, we must use "Beauty-Woman-Ron," a drug that adjusts ovarian function and strengthens the nerves. This agent is the crystallization of Mr. Meilen's lifelong efforts. It can cure all menstrual disorders and neurasthenia in women. Therefore, it is most suitable for the treatment of insomnia and menstrual difficulties. As for those who are infertile due to menstrual difficulties, fertility will naturally recover after menstruation is adjusted. It can also make the endocrine function of the whole body vigorous, and the metabolic function is also enhanced. Therefore, it can make the muscles full and plump, the skin delicate and smooth, and the complexion delicate and rosy, becoming a healthy and beautiful woman of the times.</p>
<h3>Breaking Through Male Marriage Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Written by German Dr. Karlstadt, Translated by Yang Daonan, Physician who studied in Russia</p>
<p>To Obtain Permanent Love Between the Sexes: One Should Strive to Strengthen Sexual Function!</p>
<p>Marriage difficulties are indeed the common lament of modern youths with hidden illnesses! Indeed, the pain of a person losing the qualifications for marriage is truly unspeakable. We observe him from a medical standpoint. Originally, most of the youths who are unable to marry suffer from the harm of masturbation, because masturbation can most damage the sexual glands. It can hinder sexual development, and the lower part is small, almost like a child's. Furthermore, they cannot avoid the weakening of the sexual nerves, so spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and incomplete erectile power of the penis, and reduced pleasure during intercourse. These are all symptoms of losing the qualifications for marriage. However, many parents only know that they are eager to have grandchildren, and do not care whether their son's body is healthy or not. They rashly complete the marriage for him, resulting in a tragic ending of separation.</p>
<p>Under the heavens, these countless young people are sinking into the sea of suffering, and I don't know how many useful young people have been buried. It is truly chilling to speak of. How should we sincerely and bravely save him?</p>
<p>According to recent influential scholars, such as Italian Sue-touiw (former professor of the Spanish National Medical College), and French eugenicist Dr. Talleyrand-peigard, etc., they unanimously praise the "Body-Con" medicine invented by German Mr. Meilen. All youths who are frail due to masturbation and incomplete development and early marriage can, in a short period of four or five weeks, transform the weak and unbearable function of the youthful glands, make them develop healthily, and can also bring about the symptoms caused by sexual neurasthenia, such as spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, palpitations, insomnia, memory loss, and premature aging symptoms such as haggard appearance, white hair and wrinkled forehead. Taking "Body-Con" can eliminate them all and cure the disease of incomplete development at the same time.</p>
<p>Translator's note: Because Germany wants to restore its pre-war status, the most important thing in its plan is population increase. Beforehand, a detailed method is used to check the physique of young people, and it turns out that more than 30% do not have the qualifications for marriage. This is how Germany loses tens of millions of small nationals every year, but since the advent of the "Body-Con" medicine, the population rate has been increasing day by day. The reason why Germany has its current status is due in no small part to the "Body-Con" medicine.</p>
<h3>Venereal Disease Lecture by Physician Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation Hours): 10 AM to 6 PM.</p>
<p>Intricate and Confusing Gonorrhea - Seems Like Gonorrhea But Isn't - But Is Actually Gonorrhea!</p>
<p>Many cases of gonorrhea are often mixed with other diseases. If a detailed diagnosis is not made, it is often impossible to distinguish what the disease is. For example, hemorrhoids are originally a disease of the anal region, which has nothing to do with gonorrhea. However, many gonorrhea patients do not know their disease, and the changes are originally called complications of gonorrhea. And mistakenly think it is hemorrhoids. In fact, rectal gonorrhea often starts from the mucous membrane of the anus contaminated by gonococcal secretions, or from prostatitis and seminal vesicle abscess. The symptoms are redness around the anus, discharge of yellow pus, and later often bleeding and erosion. Therefore, it is most likely to infect the wife. The anus becomes narrower due to ulceration, until it is impossible to defecate. The more dirt accumulates, the more gonorrhea there is, and the greater the danger. If the treatment is not correct, the anus will leave hard nodules after recovery, resulting in the loss of the anus's elasticity and becoming anal stenosis.</p>
<p>Patients often do not pay attention to these symptoms, so they are mostly referred to me by hemorrhoid specialists for treatment. For example, Mr. Ding Dachuan, who lives on Jin Shen Ni Road, claimed that after gonorrhea was cured, it turned into hemorrhoids. Later, after examination by experts, he realized that it was actually gonococcal proctitis. After washing it with medicine, he continued with electrotherapy. At the same time, he also took German "Klinon" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, kill bacteria, and prevent corruption. It was completely healed in five weeks, and bowel movements were smooth as before. As for his wife's gonococcal leukorrhea and vaginal erosion, she was also instructed to use "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories externally and "Klinon" internally. It was completely cured in less than four weeks.</p>

<h3>An Open Letter from a Youth</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhimin, Yueyun School, Changsha</p>
<p>The Poison of Obscene Books Makes One Masturbate for a Moment of Pleasure - Believes That As Long as One Is Determined and Seeks Treatment, It Can Be Completely Eradicated</p>
<p>When I was thirteen years old, I already had sexual concepts, and my penis always erected when I slept. Last semester, I came to Yueyun for tutoring, preparing to transfer. During the winter vacation, I felt that there was nothing to do, so I looked through the Sixteen Dynasties of the Ming Palace. At first, I thought it was a proper historical novel, but I knew that those lewd descriptions could not help but make me masturbate. Of course, on the one hand, I blame myself for not loving myself, and on the other hand, I blame myself for not having sexual knowledge. However, when a young man develops to maturity, if he does not get the comfort of the opposite sex, how can he not use this to vent?</p>
<p>Poor me, I am only fifteen years old this year.</p>
<p>When I got into the bad habit of masturbation, I didn't feel anything at first, so it was again and again, again and again, again and again... Later, I felt weak, and although I vowed to quit, many diseases had already occurred. Alas! How dangerous is masturbation! Symptoms: First, I suffered from nocturnal emission. Then came dizziness and tinnitus. Heavy head and headache, dry face, thin and yellow skin, waist and leg pain. Although I take cold water baths, it is still ineffective. And now the disease of spermatorrhea is more serious, that is, sperm is also emitted in the daytime, and even once or twice at night, and the spirit is weaker.</p>
<p>Many people suspect that I have lung disease, but sometimes my body is very refreshed, as if I have no disease. However, my will is very weak, I start things but don't finish them, and my memory is greatly reduced. Pain and trouble surrounded my entire body and mind.</p>
<p>Why am I not pessimistic? Because I think: more than 90% of the people in the country suffer from masturbation, especially young people. Even in my school, 9% of the students suffer from masturbation. Although I have had thoughts of suicide, but my parents are both over 70 years old, and they have raised me to such a big age. If I die, how can I live up to them? Moreover, now that science is developed, many diseases have fundamental treatments. As long as you are determined, is it possible that people suffering from masturbation have no bright future? I am afraid that there are always a few people suffering from masturbation among the celebrities in the world!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhonglin: I have long admired your great name, please instruct me on the way to self-treatment and save a person!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhimin: We have cured your disease in recent years. It is most effective to take "Neal's Spermatorrhea Tablets" invented by the most famous German Neal's in modern times. Because it can strengthen the mind and restrain the relaxation of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. But your disease, the sexual nerves are also very weak, so on the one hand, you must also take "Body-Con" to cure all the neurasthenia caused by spermatorrhea. Furthermore, you must also quit the bad habit of masturbation. This is indeed the most advanced method of self-treatment. (Answered by Physician Wu Zhonglin)</p>
<h3>Reader's Corner</h3>
<p>The following drugs have been specifically designated by physicians who have graduated from domestic and foreign specialized universities. Be sure to recognize the designation when purchasing. Do not mistakenly purchase miscellaneous brand cheap and inferior drugs due to blindly believing in the encouragement of others, so as to avoid causing danger to your life after taking them.</p>
<p>Masturbation and Shortness and Fatness Editor: I am a 20-year-old woman. Because I suffered from masturbation when I was young, although I have quit now, the symptoms have already appeared: slow thinking, short and fat body. But I don't know if there is spermatorrhea. My family is very strict, and all letters must be inspected by my parents. Please reply in the newspaper! (Ms. Xu Yumei, this city)</p>
<p>(Answer) Your disease is caused by ovarian dysfunction caused by masturbation, so there are phenomena such as short and fat, and slow thinking. If it is not treated, you will not be able to have children after marriage in the future. You should take "Beauty-Woman-Ron" to correct the ovaries, and you can get the beauty of the times. Also: Spermatorrhea is a male disease, and women do not have it.</p>
<p>Chronic Cough Editor: I have had a cold for several months. I have a cough and a hoarse throat, and the phlegm is thick and sticky, making it impossible to cure. My relative has asthma, and it occurs every autumn. When it occurs, she gasps for breath and there is a surge of phlegm. Please ask for a treatment method (Cai Renjun, Wuhu)</p>
<p>(Answer): To cure phlegm and cough, you can only take "Pulmonal," which is also a special medicine for relieving asthma.</p>
<p>Painful Stomach Disease Editor: My relative suffers from stomach pain and stomach upset. It has been two years. He has chest tightness, bitter mouth odor, no appetite, and a lot of farts. Please ask what medicine can cure it? (Zhang, Hankou) (Answer) Taking "Strong Stomach Essence" is most suitable for the disease.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Open Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Diplomacy is originally a matter with some mystery, because of the mystery, there is room for bargaining or flexibility. Foreign affairs are easier to handle. If once it is made public, then both parties will feel difficult to turn around. In fact, mystery has its advantages and disadvantages. If a weak country has diplomacy with a strong country, the more mysterious it is, the more unfavorable it will be for the weak country, because the strong party knows that the secret negotiations will not be leaked to the outside world, and they can ask for prices as they please.</p>
<p>If diplomacy is made public, what are the conditions they propose? What is the price we return? Let the people of the whole country know it, and let the countries of the world hear it, then the stronger party may take into account the public sentiment of the country, or consider the criticism of various countries, then the conditions proposed together may be slightly more cautious and considerate, so as not to open its mouth like a lion. And once it is secret, the country is even more nervous because it cannot measure the truth, and various countries also speculate on each other because of the relevance of interests.</p>
<p>For example, the other day, Reuters published four requirements from Japan to China. The Japanese government completely denied it, saying that the four requirements reported by the agency had other intentions. Then readers must have some doubts and do not know what is going on! Then, are the so-called four conditions true? Or are they not true? If they are not true, what kind of conditions did the Japanese side propose? All this is confusing and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese side's diplomacy has always used secrecy as a means. The more secret it is, the more beneficial it will be to them. The Japanese side knows that the Chinese value face. In fact, they can suffer losses as much as possible, but they do not lose any face, so they often use this risky and fluke-filled trick. Our side also has many domestic affairs and has no time to settle down, so how can we talk about foreign affairs? We can only get by. On the one hand, we are making active preparations, and on the other hand, we will never make the greatest sacrifice until the lowest limit. This originally came from the authorities' desperate efforts.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese side sent Kawagoe to Beijing to negotiate with China as a whole and wants to strongly invite President Jiang to return to Beijing, which is contrary to international negotiation practices. Therefore, the Chinese-Western News commented that there is no reason for the Japanese side to insist on negotiations by government leaders. This can be said to be the last moment. In short, the current Sino-Japanese negotiations have reached the final divergence point. Therefore, this negotiation should be fundamentally resolved to save the trouble of trivialities. Therefore, this negotiation should not only eliminate the proposed conditions, but also eliminate all the traces of aggression or destruction by the Japanese side in China over the years.</p>
<p>Now, the government and the public in our country truly feel that this negotiation has exceeded the limit of tolerance, as the Japanese say. The people of the whole country are watching closely the outcome of this negotiation and are willing to make the final sacrifice. The survival or death of the country is at stake. We should naturally maintain a calm attitude and make a final determination. No matter how difficult the negotiation is, we can only negotiate under the principle of not losing sovereignty and not losing an inch of land. Otherwise, we can only do our best.</p>
<h3>Entering the City</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>－Mountain Travel Notes</p>
<p>－Sir, after entering the city, the driver paused for a moment, as if he didn't dare to say it, is it lodging in the inn or...?</p>
<p>This cannot be blamed on him. Strangers carrying strange goods entered the strange county town of the mountain country. Naturally, all the faces that greet us are strange. Moreover, this is happening in the quiet and deep night! This may have aroused his suspicion, or he may be unable to stop thinking: - It may not be easy to find a lodging inn! The province is investigating tightly, and people are unwilling to open their doors randomly in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Ah Huang smiled and lightly replied: "Not sure yet!"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Everyone leaned their heads against the stiff walls of the car, and the long wooden benches made their butts a little hot. Each person was having their own good dreams, and no one paid attention to Ah Huang's reply to the driver. The carriage was strangely quiet, and the discordant snoring formed a团.</p>
<p>The road is flat now, unlike the previous bumps. The road surface is covered with yellow sand.</p>
<p>－Then, which gate should we enter? The driver spoke again.</p>
<p>－The closer one would be the Weixi Gate!</p>
<p>By the roadside, we began to see low, small houses, but there were no lights. Silently, we occasionally saw tired bodies outside the doors of the houses. At this time, the sound of the car woke them up. They seemed not to have expected that there would be a night ride by car again!</p>
<p>From the light of the lights, from the roar of the horns, we saw the city gate in front of us. The city gate was not very tall, and the battlements were like serrated teeth, stretched out in the moonlight, and buried in the surrounding area of the picture. Under the wall, except for some weeds, it was just a dark patch that could not be seen.</p>
<p>－We're here. Old Tie's colorful face and voice were really startling, and the heads leaning against the walls of the car all stood up one by one. Then, he laughed cacklingly and clapped his hands.</p>
<p>At that time, the driver must have had strange thoughts: "Entering the city may not be so easy, right? Just the inspection may take a considerable amount of time, and as a result, you may not be allowed to enter the city, which is also possible." We didn't pay attention to his strange expression. In fact, we had no obligation to tell him. If we could tell him our origins, his suspicious eyes would surely be relieved.</p>
<p>－Are they going to inspect us? Mr. Huang. Unable to endure, he spoke again.</p>
<p>－I know, just drive!</p>
<p>The car stopped four zhang away from the city gate. The gate was tightly closed. Several guards on the city tower, armed with guns, could not see what their faces looked like. The light of the electric torches shone on the car, and they shouted loudly:</p>
<p>－Where did the car come from? Who are the people on it? Where are you going in the city?……</p>
<p>The car did not give him any answer, but just poked the former flag out of the window hole. The flag was not small, and the words sewn on it were斗大的.</p>
<p>The soldiers stopped saying anything and asked us to enter through the south gate, where friends were waiting to greet us. Along the circular road around the city, roaring and roaring, we walked onto the streets of the provincial capital. The city inside the city cannot be compared with the outside of the city. On the streets, the streets that cannot be named, there are still gas lamps burning. The bright light devours the goods in the entire store. The shop assistants, staring straight at their eyes, as if watching the excitement, rushed out to ask each other, how could there be a "night car"? Whose preparation is this night car? But, no one can tell, what is given to them is just empty speculation.</p>
<p>When the goods, boxes, and baskets were unloaded into the residence, the clock pointed to two o'clock at midnight.</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, I simply couldn't sleep. I thought of the perilous situation of Jiupanzi, the path of climbing the stream, the sudden attacks of wolves and tigers, the robbery of the small merchants rushing to the market... Everything in Sichuan!</p>
<h3>Osmanthus Sugar</h3>
<p>— Mei Ping</p>
<p>My eldest sister sent a package of osmanthus sugar from the countryside, with a letter saying: It has been eight years since I spent the Mid-Autumn Festival at home. This year, seeing the osmanthus trees blooming again, I found them especially lovely. So, I found the sugar-making mold we used to use and climbed the tree with your niece to pick flowers. Mom helped buy olives, smoked plums, almonds, and other ingredients. It took us three full days to make this sugar. But the three children started eating while we were crushing the sugar, and they kept sneaking more afterward. Some of what I'm sending you is what was left over from your niece's mouth. You should also save some for your children to eat.</p>
<p>Yes, the time for eating osmanthus sugar has passed.</p>
<p>My eldest sister has been married for eight years and has three children, but a treacherous storm devoured her husband, and she has returned home. She said it’s true that she hasn’t spent the Mid-Autumn Festival at home in eight years and that seeing the osmanthus trees bloom again made her feel particularly fond of them, but she didn't reveal to me that our youth has passed, that we are encountering a demonic fate, and that the hope of saving some for our children to eat is too distant a fantasy!</p>
<p>I hid the osmanthus sugar. I should cherish the osmanthus trees that have been neglected for eight years, cherish my eldest sister's mood when making the sugar, and even more so, cherish my mother's interest in going to the market to buy olives and other ingredients. My mother's hope still lies in my eldest sister and me; the road to saving some for the children to eat is too long!</p>
<p>Looking at the osmanthus sugar with its green olive kernels, dark brown smoked plums, and jade-white almonds, I really want to go home immediately and live with Mom and my eldest sister. No, there are also three nephews and nieces now. Perhaps the osmanthus blossoms haven't withered yet.</p>
<p>Two osmanthus trees stand in the courtyard in front of my bedroom, both golden osmanthus. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the trees are covered with flowers, clusters of them hidden among the green leaves. A faint fragrance drifts in with the breeze. My eldest sister and I would wash the sugar-making molds in the bedroom and secretly go to the market to buy some smoked plums. At that time, Mother didn't allow us to pick osmanthus flowers. She said the prosperity and decline of the osmanthus blossoms were related to the family's fortunes. When the osmanthus trees bloomed, she was always busy telling people, "The trees are full of flowers again this year!" As she spoke, she opened her mouth wide, showing her happiness.</p>
<p>Relatives and neighbors often came to ask for flowers, and Mother would first ask what they were going to use them for. If they said they were making sugar, she would always refuse: "That's a sin! When the flowers fall, I'll collect them in a sheet and send them over." If they told her they were going to put them in a vase to worship the Monkey King on the Mid-Autumn Festival, she would allow it, but they still couldn't break off large branches.</p>
<p>We couldn't wait for the flowers to fall before making sugar, not because the fragrance had dissipated by then or the flowers had turned into ugly, stiff yellow things, but because she was too tempting to the children's active minds. We often secretly picked a branch of flowers and locked ourselves in the bedroom, carefully selecting the fine stamens, washing them with salt water, and gently crushing the sugar and smoked plums in a porcelain basin. The two of us, covered in sweat, would spend half a day making a dozen or so pieces of sugar. But we were happy, hiding them away one by one. When the flowers fell and Mother allowed us to make sugar with the flowers she collected in a sheet, we had already hidden a lot, but unfortunately, they were all smoked plum ones, because smoked plums were the cheapest. I didn't dare ask Mother for money to buy olives and almonds, fearing she would discover we were making sugar in secret.</p>
<p>So, Mother would pretend to be angry and scold:</p>
<p>"Oh no! There are two flower thieves in the house!"</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"Good! You're doing good things behind my back! A sin! A sin!" After a while, she would say: "Be quiet! If they (referring to relatives and neighbors) find out, they'll say I'm stingy."</p>
<p>But Mother was happy. She would go to each house to distribute the flowers she'd collected, buy olives and almonds, and make osmanthus sugar on a large scale, always making several thousand pieces.</p>
<p>In these eight years, my eldest sister has gotten married, and I've been worn down by life and drifting in the big city. Although the osmanthus trees have bloomed and withered eight times, I can be sure that, except for relatives and neighbors picking a few branches to put in vases to worship the Monkey King during the Mid-Autumn Festival, no one at home is happy to pick them to make sugar anymore, and Mother doesn't have the mood to collect the fallen flowers in a sheet and distribute them to each household.</p>
<p>In these distant eight years, my eldest sister has had three children, and I'm also a father. But Mother has regained her interest in going to the market to buy olives, smoked plums, almonds, and other ingredients. My eldest sister climbs the tree to pick flower branches just like when she was little. During this large-scale sugar-making, I think Mother must be missing her son even more for not being able to participate in this grand event that hasn't happened in eight years.</p>
<p>Looking at the osmanthus sugar with its green olive kernels, dark brown smoked plums, and jade-white almonds, I really can't bear to put it in my children's mouths, only to have it vanish in an instant. This osmanthus sugar has a sad story. This osmanthus sugar is related to the rise and fall of our family.</p>
<p>I wrote a letter to my eldest sister, telling her that I was treasuring the package of sugar like when I was little and that I wanted to know more about the current situation of the sugar makers.</p>
<h3>While Mr. Was Defecating</h3>
<p>— Mao Si</p>
<p>"Or...or...orph...you orphan's 'orph' word...ha...ha..." He'd only said half of 'orph' when a yawn forced its way from his intestines to his throat. The mouth that should have been forming the 'orph' sound opened like a trumpet, revealing two rows of teeth with black gaps. Two lines of drool stretched from his head. Tears were caught by the sleep in the corners of his eyes. Clear snot, however, flowed unimpeded from his nostrils down a groove to his mouth.</p>
<p>But the one-eyed child sitting at a desk with a "Small Six Characters" slip of paper stuck to it laughed out loud when he saw the teacher's face through the gaps in the books. The teacher slammed the bamboo stick he was holding on the desk: "Who's laughing there?!"</p>
<p>The classroom fell silent.</p>
<p>The teacher, holding the bamboo stick, orph'ed and orph'ed for less than three minutes, then put down the Orphan Reader and tapped the desk twice with the bamboo stick: "The teacher is going to defecate. You all study hard by yourselves!"</p>
<p>The orphans nodded their heads together, chanting the book in unison. The teacher was satisfied. He put down his bamboo stick, hunched his back, and left the classroom.</p>
<p>Seeing the teacher's reed-like back disappear, Little Six was the first to jump from his stool onto the desk. Everyone else followed him, jumping onto stools, desks, and window sills. Little Six said to everyone like a commander: "Where did the teacher go? Do you know?"</p>
<p>Everyone raised a hand, bending the three middle fingers down and sticking the thumb and little finger up, putting the thumb in their mouths. They sang together: "Pull, pull, pull, tear, tear, tear, the teacher smokes opium, a live monkey performing!" After singing, they jumped on the desks like monkeys.</p>
<p>"Hey! Have you ever seen an opium pipe?" Ah Gen jumped next to Little Six, speaking proudly, as if he wanted to usurp Little Six's authority.</p>
<p>"No... we haven't seen one."</p>
<p>Ah Gen picked up the bamboo stick that the teacher often used to hit their heads. "The opium pipe is about the same as this stick, but it has a... black taro head on top." He crumpled the teacher's textbook into a ball. "This is a little glass lamp!" Then, he went to the desk, put one end of the bamboo stick in his mouth, and pointed the other end at the crumpled ball of paper. "Tear, tear, tear!" After tearing for a while, he exhaled a puff of hot air from his mouth.</p>
<p>Little Six covered his head with a rush cloth short shirt and rubbed ink on his face to make a mustache. "Catalina, Madeli, go to the store!" As he spoke, he kicked Ah Gen, who was on the desk. Ah Gen fell from the desk, and his scabby head bled. He cried and cursed Little Six as a "little bastard." Suddenly, Ah Gen scrambled up from the ground and hit Little Six on the head with the stick. A red bump immediately rose on Little Six's shiny, bald head. So, the two of them wrestled into a ball.</p>
<p>Those standing nearby all clapped their hands and stomped their feet, cheering!</p>
<p>"Who's fighting there?!"</p>
<p>Hearing this sound, everyone sat down in their seats. Little Six and Ah Gen also let go of each other and returned to their seats. The teacher came in majestically, holding a small teapot, stepping with a spirited eight-character gait. He first saw the blood on Ah Gen's head, and he asked loudly: "Ah Gen! Were you fighting just now?" A pungent smell wafted from the gaps in his black teeth.</p>
<p>"It was Little Six who hit me... head... blood... blood," Ah Gen cried.</p>
<p>"Teacher, Ah Gen said you were eating..."</p>
<p>"What? You two are no good... stand in the corner!" The teacher picked up the teapot, took a sip, and spat out: "If you do this again next time, I'll send you to the police station!"</p>
<p>Little Six and Ah Gen cried as they stood facing the wall. The rest nodded their heads together, chanting the book in unison.</p>

<p>(1) Eating shark fin every meal, swallow's nest every course. After a while, it makes you lose your appetite. And it costs too much money. Some people work hard, grinding away their lives. They gnaw on cold pancakes every day, dreaming of hot steamed buns. There are also poor friends who eat vegetarian food and chant "Amitabha." Amitabha, sometimes they have a meal, sometimes they don't. They gnaw on roots and leather. Even more are disaster victims, with empty bellies, hollow and empty, looking at the sky, drinking the west wind. Many, many, many, many disaster-stricken men and women. How can they survive? Stop nagging, stop nagging. Whose life is easy? Don't be afraid to spend too much money. Save on shark fin and swallow's nest. Let's all save those suffering from natural disasters.</p>
<p>(2) At home, silk crepe suits. Outside, Indian silk. Lots and lots in the closet. Fox fur, sable tips, peacock down. Some people don't have enough money, so they scrounge around. They've barely drunk two cans of soup. Thick clothes can be stuffed with meat. There are also poor friends, with torn mats covering their bones. Ladies and gentlemen, shivering again and again. Hands stiff, feet dead, tears flowing. Even more are disaster victims, empty of everything, hollow and empty, barefoot and bare-chested, facing the north wind. Rushing and rushing, several rushes. At the time, the voice sighed. Alas, the end of life. Stop playing deaf, stop playing deaf. Who doesn't have a few old clothes to spare? Don't be afraid of thick, fluffy cotton. Lest no one use it this winter. Quickly donate it to charitable organizations to distribute to disaster areas.</p>

<p>The explanation for the copper engraving on the third day, "Author of a Romantic Family," is actually the sub-headline of "A Letter to Warner Officials," which is placed in front of the Yuanxia beef juice advertisement. "Xi Jianong and Gu Lanjun at a Night Party" is the explanation for the copper engraving. This error seems very convoluted and strange, and one reader wrote a letter to question it. We hereby correct the error and apologize.</p>

<p>The "Little Carpenter Song" sung by Li Keng in the Minxin new film "Mother's Love" has been recorded by Baishi as a record. The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Saw, gu, saw, gu, push, ah, push, knock, ah, knock, la, la, la! The one who pushes pushes, the one who strikes strikes, everyone works diligently together. Busy life is as difficult as the cicada, constantly buying from morning till night, large and small saws, small pieces of wood, wood shavings and ashes, pieces into large windows and doors. Who knows it was made by me?</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Minxin's New Film "Mother's Love"</h3>
<p>Tolstoy said: "That which binds the universe together is love!" And the most powerful kind of love is none other than a mother's love: natural, innocent, real, and great.</p>
<p>The film "Mother's Love" was also formed from this idea. The creation of this script dates back two or three years ago. After multiple revisions by the playwright, the perfect "Mother's Love" script was finally completed.</p>
<p>Human selfishness often creates irredeemable sins. The father in this story is one who creates sins due to selfishness. But "sincere love can resolve deep-seated hatred," so this sinner is finally rescued by a great mother's love.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also a small number of mothers in the world, especially divorced women, who lack love for their children. But the general phenomenon is completely the opposite. Therefore, "Mother's Love" only focuses on the majority, and those few can be said to have created endless darkness and evil through their own selfishness.</p>
<p>The mother here abandons everything that a woman should enjoy in order to safeguard her beloved son's unlimited future. She is unwilling to let her innocent child be trapped in a bad environment due to her terrible experiences. Her great spirit of sacrifice finally wins the final victory.</p>
<p>The devil rises one foot, the Tao rises ten feet. In a society full of evils caused by human selfishness, there is always this extremely high demonic power at work. And the greatest enemy of demonic power is righteous people. Xiao Fen in "Mother's Love," after growing up, is someone who does not succumb to demonic power. But in the midst of extreme danger, he almost loses his life.</p>
<p>Sacrificing one's life is not a good way to save sin. For example, the parents in "Mother's Love," although they sacrifice their lives, it is not enough to wash away the sins they have caused. However, they are in a situation where there is no other way, so they have no choice but to resort to this desperate measure.</p>
<p>The improper development of motherly love is spoiling. Spoilering often harms the weak soul and has the opposite effect. "Mother's Love" specifically highlights this point.</p>
<p>One who is near vermilion gets stained red, one who is near ink gets stained black. Assuming that we do not immediately reject the past, for example, the actions of Mencius's mother moving three times are not meaningless behaviors. Motherly education is different from teacherly education. Motherly education is invisible, powerful, and all-encompassing. Motherly education does not require any price and almost exists between every bow and breath. Here, there is a higher understanding of the issue of motherly education.</p>
<p>Because humans have selfishness, external temptations arise. Even if selfishness is temporarily resolved, it often leads to endless regrets. If selfishness not only exists but also has a proper resolution, it is an even more irreparable mistake. The father in "Mother's Love" is a representative of this type of person.</p>
<p>As for the film itself, the director, actors, photography, sets, sound, and other aspects, the audience can directly obtain satisfactory answers without the need for further elaboration here.</p>
