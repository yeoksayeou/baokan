<p>倫敦本社訪員頃悉、英國外相艾登、曾於今晨以英國建議案一伴、提交法國外長佛蘭亭與比國總理齊蘭、此項建議案、目的在保證英法比三國之合作、其實行之步驟有二、　德國違反條的、致使國際局勢感受危險、三國合作、其旨卽在恢復國際安全局勢、　一俟國際局勢回復安全之後、英國卽允援助法比兩國對於萊茵河方面現行界錢、永負保障之責、此項三國協定、將來德國亦可加入、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦英國艾登外相昨日曾向法比兩國提出一種建議、據外交界人士所稱、建議目的、係在「重奠國際法治精神、」內容現雖保守秘密、惟據本社外交訪員探悉、其要點如下、</p>
<p>對於德國廢止羅卡諾公的行為、明白加以譴責、</p>
<p>法俄互助公的是吾與羅卡諾公的相抵觸一項問題、由德法兩國申請海牙國際法庭裁决之、惟德國對於仲裁程序或法庭裁決書、若均拒不接受、則應如何辦理、此層英國建議似未規定、</p>

八）　　三　本巿魚鮮之種類與來源行銷本巿之魚鮮，種類繁多，不勝枚舉，但就其來源而言，則可簡別為二，一為來自沿海之鹽水魚，因其生長於鹽質之海水中，普通亦簡稱海鮮。一為來自內河內江之淡水魚或鮮水魚，以其藉以棲息之河水不含鹽質故也；淡水魚一般叉有稱河鮮，以與海鮮相對。此外吾人又常聞冰鮮魚與養殖魚之名稱，其實冰鮮魚即為海鮮，因其一離海水，即難生息，故需以冰冰之，藉免腐爛，遂名冰鮮，（河鮮亦有以冰冰之者，但不若海鮮之普遍）。養殖魚為淡水魚之一部份，因嘉湖崑錫一帶，常闢池沼以養殖河鮮也。至日本魚係日輪在我國沿海侵捕而得。幷向本埠推銷，故有日本魚之稱。今再將海鮮河鮮兩大種分述於次。　　一·海鮮——海鮮大都產自江浙沿海，亦有一部份來自山東沿海，因其裝運來滬有輪裝船裝桶裝三種，故叉可別而為三　山東沿海以漁輪捕魚者較多，本市亦有前節所列各公司以漁輪捕獲，同時彼等即以漁輪載運來滬，平同每年總計量約合船運來滬者之三分之一·　江浙沿海，類多以舊式帆船捕魚，同時即以帆船運銷上海，其中更有湖帮，長興，台州，奉化，鎭海，等帮之別，其運入量佔本市進口冰鮮之第一位。　北方之大連烟台靑島等地，南方之舟山沈家門溫州等地，大都皆用木桶裝運魚鮮，至本埠求售，每年四五月間運來最多。至海鮮之中，所包括之魚類當極繁多，今將申新各報列有行市者列下：大黃魚，小黃魚，鯧魚，鯧魚，鞋底魚，鮮蝦，梭子蟹，帶魚，虎魚，鯊魚，白果子，銅盆等十五種。　　二·河鮮—一河鮮大都來自蘇省之崑山蘇州無錫等處，及浙省之嘉湖一帶，沿長江一帶之蕪湖九江漢口等處，亦為其重要來源。由江浙運來者多用水槽或水櫃裝運，到滬後仍能鮮活。由其他各地運來者，或用水櫃，或用本桶，死活不一，每當季節或年終，供量特旺。河鮮之往往見諸報端者為：靑蝦，　魚，草魚，鯽魚，鯉魚，白鰱魚，花鰱魚，靑魚，編魚及河蟹等十種。　　四進口魚鮮及其巿價　　本市魚鮮，如前所述，有海鮮河鮮之別，而海鮮因其裝運方法不同，又有輪裝船裝桶裝之別，因而一般統計機關為方便起見，對於本巿進口魚鮮之統計，亦沿用該項分類。今將最近三年之進口量列記於後：　　註！此為一月至六月總計，非全年總計。　　根據前表，我人可得出一有趣之對照，卽進口海鮮（不論輪裝船裝或桶裝）之數量增加，面其價値反形降落，或價値之降低率更比數量之降低率為甚，至進口淡水魚類（即河鮮）大體上則無此種背逆而馳之趨勢。此種歧異之原因有二：一為海鮮進口量因漁汎關係，上落甚大，往往發生供過於求之現象，二為日本漁輪輸入之海鮮，傾銷市上，凡此二因，皆足使海鮮巿價下落特別迅速也。　　若就一般觀察，近年魚鮮巿價均有下落之勢，此與一般購買力低落有關，今選海鮮中之黃魚，鰻魚及帶魚，河鮮中之白鰱魚，靑魚為例（因其銷量較多），列表比較於次：（未完）申報國貨周刊努力提倡土貨運動  玄萬　　在繁榮工商，昭蘇整個民族經濟的前途，我們的努力提倡土貨運動，的確是一件最切實最基本的主要工作。　　大家知道，歷年來洋貨的傾銷，是不僅使我們的國貨事業，奄無生機，並且，它向我國內各地無孔不入掃蕩的結果，它早毁滅了我農村經濟自給自足的現象，促成我們全部國民經濟的破產，而因了許多人們崇拜洋貨心理的堅築，土貨銷路的日趨式徵，使我們眞正的純粹的國產——土貨，更日趨衰敗和沒落的路上走，陷在黑暗和永遠沒有生氣的泥沼中。　　所以，在這時候，我們應該如何積極地共同起來，大家對於提倡土貨運動的盡力，那實是我們每個國民的天責，而我們努力的結果，一定能够做到：第一，可以抵制洋貨，避免外人經濟上的侵略，消減每年巨大的入超，養成國人普遍性的節儉美德。第二，可以發展生產，保持我國固有的農村副業，使他日漸改良，和隨時隨地的增加產量，亟謀以合作的方式，去發展它成為農村的小機器工業，更逐漸而發展大規模的機器工業。第三，可以復典農村，因為提倡鄉下人自用土產，和城市人競用土產的結果，必定可使農村生產收入，大見增加，活動農村金融，繁榮內地市面。第四可以助長現有國產新興的機製工業的發展，因洋貨市塲的消滅，民衆購買力的增進，而日見發達。　　最近，敎育家邰爽秋先生等發起，組織實施提倡土貨會，規定十年的進行計劃，而在本市民衆敎育館，舉行「土貨第一年」開幕典禮，這確是一個很有意義和價値的舉動。際此國難日深，民族存亡，已在千鈞一髮的時候，我願全國民衆，大家「各本出一分力量，就是增加國家一分原氣」的精神，共同努力提倡土貨運動。注意鄉區洋布販  子系　　在我們鄉鎭地方，時常有一種背着或掮着大包布疋的布販，走往每個鄉鎭及村莊，呌賣布疋。查此類布疋，可說十分之八九是洋布，大都從外人開設的廠家經奸商設法運輸出來的劣貨，價錢自然特別便宜。他們——布販，拿到鄕下來出賣，交易旣易，獲利又多。一般不知不識的鄉民，自然只要貨色好看，誰再去細辨是國貨還是洋貨，（而且大都不能辨出國貨與洋貨）同時，因為這類布疋的貨色已為多數鄕民所樂用；價値的低廉，更為多數鄉民所歡迎。布販在鄉間生意的興隆，也可想見，不過這樣一來，，一向服用國貨的鄉民，說不定無形間都會用起洋貨來了。所以，我以為各鄉鎭區公所或敎育機關，今後如再發見這類布販，務須勸令販賣國布，盡推銷國貨的責任。希望各地人士，特別留意。經濟電燈的新發明  孟昭　　吾友吳興錢公偉君，研嗜科學，孜孜不倦，去春從事剏造經濟電燈，屢毁屢製，卒底於成！獲實業部發交「獎勵工業技術審查委員會」審查合格，批示「應准專利五年亦而六個月公吿期，亦已於今年二月十二日期滿，錢君曾遵章繳費，且領證書，記者竊喜此項「經濟電燈的新發明」足以光榮我國貨界，特於某日前往北京路鹽業大厦三樓，錢君所創之進益電器事務所，參觀試騐，見錢君將玲瓏小巧的三支燭光的經濟電燈，（燈頭裏有小方棚之精密構造）試騐時，附着於托板上，一端裝經濟電燈，一端裝二十五支燭光的燈泡，撥動開關放光時，兩燈同明！二十五支燭光的燈泡雖經過電流而光如豆！經濟燈的放光，則明亮異常！足見錢君匠心搆造時的苦心！據錢君吿余，除製造機器不得不仰給舶來外，燈頭等原料，已可採用國產，記者參觀後，覺甚滿意，乃興辭，臨行錢行委余撰說明書，以吿將來愛用國貨同胞，茲再摘錄介紹於后。　　（甲）經濟電燈的優點　　（一）節省電費　　此項經濟電燈，因安倍增高，電力壓低，故用電極省！每晚以燃點八小時計，僅費銅元的兩枚，較點煤油燈更加便宜。　　（二）燈光明亮　　燈光雖僅三支，而明亮異常，在燈下讀書，寫字，及女紅，烹飪等事，均極適宜，　　（三）通夜有益　　通夜點經濟電燈，便於防警，及婦女哺乳小孩。老年人如厠等……　　（四）能免傷目　　燃經濟電燈，因燈光並不强烈！能免夏日傷目　　（五）美觀耐用　　經濟電燈，外面用膠木製造，燈頭輕便靈巧！式樣美觀！經久耐用！　　（六）定價低廉　　為普及人羣福利起見，定價特別低廉，俾便家家購置，人人樂用！　　總之，無論公共機關，學校，商店，住宅，用經濟電燈，有意想不到之利益！　　（乙）經濟電燈使用法　　祗須將經濟電燈，套入原來之燈頭上，旋好大小兩燈泡，旁有機紐開關，使用時，或小或小，均可輕撥開關，從心所欲，異常便利。（錢公偉經濟電燈廠設於無錫）國貨通信  （仰葊）　　我們到廣州之第二日，晤見劉紀文巿長，席間詢以長謂廣州人對於國貨很熱烈，蓋愛國之心，較為濃厚，現市商會市政府廣州市黨部省會公安局廣州婦女聯合會共同組織一廣州市提倡國貨委員會，會中附設國貨陳列館及國貨經銷塲，經銷塲年有六十餘萬元之營業，同人卽請市長夫人出而提倡，劉君極願與其夫人努力進行，並參酌婦女服用國貨團辦法，昨在市商會歡迎席上，熊少康主席介紹提倡國貨委員會主席委員余卓鴻君談話，余君極言廣州婦女極熟心提倡服用國貨，學校學子，允為熱烈，近有婦女服裝展覽之組織，允為可佩，目下正在聯絡學校及婦女界進行以期提倡國貨之聲浪，徧及全國，攷察團同人均國貨界巨子，對此工作尤為有興趣。五彩玻璃墨水筆  朱斐　　年來國人提倡國貨的努力，確是使入很可欣慰的，但沒有好國貨給人應用，徒唱無補實際的高調，也是無意識的，所以一面提倡，一面要努力造產。　　鋼筆——尤其是筆尖，這日常應用最廣的文具，誰都知道我國不能自造，一向仰給於國外，這雖是很小的東西，竟成了一筆鉅大的漏巵。　　現有羅森君，因戚國貨鋼筆和筆尖的缺乏，費長時的研究，用科學方法配製，發明五彩玻璃墨水筆一種，定價旣廉，式樣美觀，旋轉如意，經久耐用，於書寫中文更覺流利，並無筆頭生銹開岔及戳破紙張之虞，用後一經揩拭，卽煥然如新，用於複寫，較鉛筆更為便利，實為文化界不可不備之要品。此種鋼筆，現由閘北恒業路森森化學玻璃廠製造，希望學生界試用，便可知道它的特點了。　　（萍按）：此種玻璃筆，筆尖形狀為瓜輪式，用時先將筆尖在墨水中醮滿一半後，旋轉書寫使每輪中所儲墨水，依次流下水息，每次可書中文至少三十字，寫時執筆法與鋼筆同，惟筆劃粗細，寫重則粗，輕則為細，運用如意，確是値得介紹的工具。　　本刊啟事　自下期起，本刊改定每星期三出版，希讀者注意！一週間國貨新訊　　上海江海關三樓機器國貨陳列所，現已開放，供大衆參觀，有三百餘工廠之出品，貨物極為美備。　　中華工業總聯合會十六日召集廠商討論保障小工業，將合組團體，以謀改進。　　上海市民國貨年會敦請名流每星期日演講一决，地點在民敎館。　　江蘇省國民國貨年揭慕禮，定本月廿五日在鎭江舉行，同日有游行及提燈大會，各商店舉行國貨平賣週。　　實業部籌辦中之中國造紙公司，正計劃造林，供應原料。　　上海國際展覽會正積極籌備，我國貨廠商，均要求參加展覽。　　上海國貨界組西北考察團，已於十五日啟程。　　閩商在滬籌設興安蔗糖營業所，十五日芷式成立。　　中國捲菸製造廠研究捲烟表皮紙，已完全成功，年可塞漏巵四百餘萬元。　　本市提倡土貨年幹事會，於十二日在民敎館舉行土貨第一年開幕禮，情殊熱烈。</p>

<p>通俗講座發刊辭  通俗讀物編刋社　　近年來，因為國家當前迫切的需要，一般的注意力都移在種種急求成效的事務方而；對於比較迂緩而久遠的事業，很少有人注意。十餘年前，大家競倡「敎育救國」，此刻如再有人作這種運動，一定被人笑為不懂緩急，迂闊無當。非常時期應當有非常的措施，我們並不否認，但是經常久遠的工作，為國家謀百年之計者，也决不應當廢置。何况「治三年之疾」，尙須「求七年之艾」，而今日中國的積弱，不僅三年，則根本的大計，當然也不是急功近利所能見效。我們認為此刻中國有一伴異常重要，歷來志士曾經屢决大聲疾呼，而至今尙未完成的，便是「喚起民衆」。　　中國的民衆，大家都知道，在物質生活上是全界最困苦的。但是在精神生活上，又何嘗不如此？並且物質生活的困苦，卽是因為智識技能的不够的愚味是貧弱的最大原因。「喚起民衆」的目的，不僅要使他們知道自己生活的貧乏，應當努力求知能來改進，同時要使他們了解此刻國家的危機，他們對於國家的責任，應當怎樣為自己為國家打開險惡的環境，努力奮鬥。並且在這個世變日亟的時代，允其應當知道做一個現代國民必須有的基本常識。但是我們如果檢討一下此刻一般民衆的知識狀况，一定會非常驚懼。他們受了數千年因襲傳統的思想，以及一切神怪，禮敎的束縛，養成愚妄，誇大，依賴，盲從，自私，信命運，不團結，對政治冷漠種種積習，使他們最不適宜於做現代式國家的國民。我們想到此刻國家在嚴重的侵略和威脅之下種種可能的危機，允不禁替他們寒心。　　但是這種積習的養成，並非由於正統派的聖經賢傳。倒是為士大夫所不齒的通俗讀物，例如唱本，鼓詞，彈詞，評話小說之類，是他們惟一的娛樂品，也就是他們思想上惟一的糧食。這些書籍，支配了他們一生的生活習慣，思想行為，甚至於死後的喪葬。所謂革新思想的新文化運動，永遠停滯在受中等敎育以上的上層社會，並沒有達到下層民衆。並且卽使受過中等敎育的靑年，一出學校，也有受不住舊勢力「往後拉」的惰性，仍舊投降於原來的惡習慣的。一般民衆沒有美好健全的讀物，實在是從事於文化事業者的過失。　　我們創辦這個刋物，就想竭我們的棉薄，在這方面稍盡心力。我們想以通俗明暢的國語或方言，把我國歷史上先民的嘉言懿行，壯舉偉業，以及現代的世界知識，科學思想，寫成故事或歌詞，來逐漸代替民間流行的讀物，淘汰舊有讀物中迷信，妄誕，淫猥的部分。我們相信只有大多數的民衆在思想行為上能做到「健康」，「負責」，「科學化」，「不自私」這幾個基本條伴，國家的建設，民族的復興才有希望。　　但是這種「喚起民衆」的工作是艱難而鉅大的。我們自知能力薄弱，要憑這微弱的呼聲，期望達到這遙遠的目標，也正如「操豚肺而祝滿車」，誠不免為智者所笑。但我們深信這是士生今日無可旁貸的責任，也就不容再顧慮到自己能力的有限，重貽因循。我們希望有志於此的加入合作，有經騐的批評指導。非不知道遠任重，然而我們只能往前邁進了。愛迪生（Thomas　Edison）  鄭侃嬨　　誰都知道現代最大的發明家是愛迪生。他的發明有一千幾百種，其中以電燈，電影，留聲機為最著名。未見過愛迪生的人，聽見他的發明成績這樣偉大，也許要懷疑他是一個非常的人，其實他也是一個普通人，不過比常人特別努力些罷了。　　愛迪生於一八四七年二月十一日生於美國米蘭一個荒村裏，父親是一個農夫，家裏不頂有錢，愛迪生小的時候，跟着他的父母移居於密執安州，他就在那裏進小學。　　愛迪生這孩子，自小性子就古怪，不愛念書，只愛東拆拆西摸摸，什麽事情都要看個究竟，打碎沙鍋問到底。除了他的母親外，誰也不喜歡他，以為他又蠢又傻，决定不能做出什麽事來。大家又說他母親偏心，「癩痢頭兒子自家好」！他進了學校，什麽也學不上；每决考試，成績總是倒數第一；敎他的敎師都灰心了，衆口一詞說他是一個低能兒，決定要他退學。他的母親聽見這個消息很難受，可是他並不失望，因為他知道除非眞是身體有毛病的，天下斷不會有一個不可以敎育成人的孩子。他相信這完全是敎師不懂得小孩個性，胡亂施敎的過失，決不會是他的兒子低能。　　一天，愛迪生的母親正為她兒子着急，躱在一間沒有人的房裏，暗暗打算補救的辦法，恰巧愛迪生也倉倉皇皇地撞進來了，臉上紅一塊白一塊，怪難看的。原來他剛從學校回家，家裏的人都圍着羞他，他只聽見「傻孩子」，「沒出息」，「笨東西」一片罵聲，也分不淸駡他的都是些誰。他也不敢抬頭看看，以為媽媽也是在這許多人中，一起駡他，心裏更加難過，只覺得走頭無路。他滿肚子委屈，搶進房裏，不想竟撞着母親一個人在那裹。他忙抱着母親呌一聲「媽」，跟着便大哭起來。母親知道他又受了委屈，一面替兒子擦淚，一面安慰他道：「好孩子，不要難過，有媽媽呢。先生不敎你，媽媽敎你，你肯發憤用功便能上進，怕什麽呢？」從此愛迪生便不上學，在家跟母親讀書了。因為母親懂得他的性子，順着他的興趣「循循善誘」，他便進步得很快。十歲那年，他已能讀英國史，羅馬興亡史，大英百科全書等名著。他讀書博而能精，但也不是只讀死書，又極善歡做實騐，凡事都要耐心設法，試騐出究竟來才肯干休。譬如他六歲那年，因為要親自細看小鵝怎樣出卵，曾整天一個坐在鵝籠旁邊等候，午餐也不肯回去吃，惹得他爸爸生氣。可見他在校讀書不好，並非他資質不如人，實在因為那時的功課太沒趣味，他別有所戀，心不在焉罷了。　　愛迪生的父親看見兒子喜歡做實騐，讓他在母親房裏佈置一個實騐室。父親的意思是想借這個方法來覊縻他，免得他四處淘氣去，想不到這竟成了他的偉大發明的起點。他有了這間實騐室，跳跳蹦蹦高興得什麽似的。他把母親給他買糖果的錢，省下來設法採買或自製各種必需的實騐器具和藥品。他的屋子裏好玩着哪：全是破罐頭舊瓶子，有時白天關着窗戶，點着洋燭，拿這個燒燒那個泡抱，整天埋頭在實騐室裏，連小朋友們招他出去玩，他也沒心思了。不幸他的家裏非常窮困，不能讓他老是躭在家裏讀書和實騐。十二歲那年，他因受不了許多飢寒，只好在火車上做賣報童子。他因自小窮苦，覺得做人不能馬馬虎虎，每一伴事都打起精神來幹。天沒有亮，他便跑上車來販報，夜深還在讀他所心愛的書籍。他肯吃苦，又懂事，會談話，和一般坐客和車上職員都合得來，大家歡喜這孩子。因此他的報紙的銷路很大，又許他在車上的行李房裏設置一個實騐室。　　過了兩年，恰好美國因為「奴隸問題」，南北交戰。愛迪生曉得戰事消息，誰也急於知道；他就在行李房裏辦一個快報，專載戰塲消息。他自己做總理，做編輯，做排工，做校對，做報販。因為他辦事認眞，快報的銷路很好。雖然如此，但他也只把辦報，當做一種副業，大部分的時間，還是消磨在實騐室裏。不想他正在埋頭苦幹，以求深造的當兒，竟無意中闖了一塲大禍；實騐室裹的燐瓶，因受火車顚簸，倒地猝破，馬上延燒起來。一會兒把整個行李車燒得精光大吉！監車的查出火燒的原因，氣得眼睛發白，順手一個耳光，把愛迪生打得滿腦袋火星亂爆。從此他有一個耳朶，終生聽不淸楚。　　愛迪生無地自容，只得回故鄉來。親屬看見他這樣落拓，都說他沒出息，對他睜一雙眼，閉一隻眼。只有他母親了解他，婉言勸慰他，為他在家裏另闢一個實騐室。愛迪生因為辦過快報，曉得電報便捷可責，將來一定發達，早已存心研究電報；只苦家裏儀器難得，無從着手。恰好有一决因為他冒險，救了一個火車站長的兒子死裏逃生，站長戚激他，要重重酬報他。他不要財物，只願到車站電報室裏去學習。站長當然許他，他高興得手舞足蹈。他知道機會難逢，從此日夜加緊用功，不上四個月，關於電報的一切知識全學會了。他十五歲那年，因為成績優異，已被正式任為車站技匠，後來又在各電報公司工作，一面任職，一面研究。等到他移居在波士頓的時候，已經發明了案上電報機。他借了許多債去製造電報機，不幸失敗，從債台上跌下來，只得逃去到紐的去。　　沒有一個銅子，沒有一個朋友，愛迪生在紐的住了三天，窮愁潦倒，苦不可言。第四天他在報紙廣吿欄得知有一家股票公司招聘電報匠，他忙去應徵。在他就職第二天，電報機忽然在公司交易最盛的時候壞了，電報一停，公司的損失以百萬計，總理惶急無計，雙脚亂跳：連忙求敎新來的愛迪生。愛迪生僅費八分鐘的時間，便把電報機修理好，使公司不受一點損失。公司念他功高，就把他升做經理。愛迪生這才有錢有時間來安心研究。他第一步完成他的案上電報機，和朋友合股開一波愛商行，製造電報機發賣。同時他的新機械得幾處的特許專賣，又出讓電報機某一部分的專利特權，得了四萬金，資本雄厚，經營更加順利。他跟着又發明自動電報機，留聲機和電燈等，允以電燈最費他的心思。　　愛迪生早想發明白熱電燈（就是現在我們通用的電燈），但直至一八七八年才决心從事研究。燈泡裹所用的炭素綫，是他用了兩年的工夫，挑選六千種以上的物質，經過六千種以上的試騐，才選定的。但這也不過是一部分的成功，還不能製造整個電燈，因為玻璃泡裏的炭素錢？當白熱時便會自焚，同時玻璃泡也會溶化。後來他經過許多苦心研究的結果，知道用眞空的玻璃抱可免此弊，白熱電燈才算完成。一八八二年九月，愛迪生才在紐的的帕爾街創辦最初的電燈所。當時的人民還有許多迷信「電卽是雷」之說，深怕安置電燈會危及他們的生命，因此電綫在白天安置好，夜裏便被割去了。經過許多說明解釋，才漸漸得到市民的信任。最初的用戶不過二百家，但很快便通行全世界了。愛迪生後來繼續研究發明，共得一千幾百種的專利特權，無一不是造福人類的。他一天到晚工作，吃飯睡覺，都在實騐室裏，一直到鬍髭雪白，還是如此。他一天要工作十六七小時，也不休息。他老年常常對人說：「我雖然只活到八十歲，但是我的工作，抵得上二百多歲了。」有人說：美國財富，有一半是他掙的。他已經於一九三年死了，可是他的事業，他對人類和國家的貢獻。是永遠使他不朽的。出版界定期刊物在國難時期的任務  獨秀　　　在本刊第四十六期上，我們讀到了「國難時期的出版方針」一文，在這篇文章中，該文作者指出了國難時期的出版方針有三大原則：一為非常時的，而不是平時的；二為一元的，而不是多元的；三為大衆的，而不是貴族的。筆者認為為這三大原則，都可絕無問題，而且應竭力求其實現的。現在這問題的發展，似可到了不是原則上的商討，而是具體方案的提供，該文作者，謂將另文專論，那麽關於這一點，筆者暫且不加討論，現在卽就聯想到的一點，加以闡述。　　誰都戚覺到的，國難期間最重要的工作，莫過於敎育大衆的工作，卽所謂訓練工作，這敎育大衆的工作，確實「可以增長整個民族求生存的力量，也可消蝕整個民族求生存的力量」。關鍵所在，第一有沒有推進這工作？第二推進這工作的方法是吾正確？我們現在所要討論的就是推進的方法問題。　　據筆者的愚見所及，這國難期間敎育大衆的材料之供給，除掉各書局出版各種適合非常時需要的一切出版物以外，定期刋物是應該負起很重要的責任來的。為什麽原因呢？第一，定期刋物不外乎月刋，半月刋，週刋，三日刊等，以時間而論，旣不若日報之供給斷斷續續零零星星的材料，又不若一部洋洋灑灑二十萬言的國際政治概觀的那樣容易失掉時間性，因其一月出版一决，或一週出版一决，對於國內外時事的評述，旣可有系統，又能把握時間性，讀者於每月每週　覽一過以後，卽可根據這觀點，觀察下一月或下一週時事的發展，國際的動態，等到一月或一週過去了，讀者一方面可以根據自己的觀察下一個判斷，同時又可將下一週或一月出版的週刋或月刋上的言論，與自己的觀察互相對照加以研究。假定這一本週刋或月刋的內容，確實能負起敎育大衆之使命而無愧的，那麽這刋物的內容，卽可成為訓練大衆的材料，而收到了很大的效果。以目前國際情勢之瞬息萬變，遠東局面之日趨緊張，人民的政治苦悶，已達焦點，「怎樣才能獲得民族的出路」？「應怎樣供獻自己的能力」？「應怎樣訓練自己」？這種種問題，都是大衆亟待解决的，那麽最富於時間性的定期刋物，便可以適應這一個迫切的需要了。第二，出版界供給的書籍，每一本書有每一本書的專門性質，談國際的當然不會談到經濟學原理，談經濟學原理的更不會談到遠東政局，在作某一項問題專門性的研究上，此項書籍，唯恐其不豐富，但在敎育大衆的訓練材料之供給上，希望每一個民衆都能購買一本關於非常時的出版物，旣非一般入民的經濟力量所可能，又非一般忙於衣食的讀者們的時間所許可。然而在定期刋物方面，却是絕無問題的，目前的一般定期刋物，往往都是「炒十景」，有「時事述評」，有「國際講話」，有「學術專論」，有「書報介紹」，有「生活紀錄」，有「軍事常識」，有「文藝詩歌」，那麽祗須定期刋物的編輯人員，能把握住時代的需要，國民的要求，不難把這刋物全部內容，以非常時訓練材料之供給為對象，更不難能名副其實的担負起這任務來的。讀者祗須每月或一週購置一冊，他所需要的東西，這刋物都能全部的供給了，不必購置大批的書籍，而發生時間上和財力上的困難。第三，每一本書籍的價格，最便宜的僅少要兩角，貴的要四五元，而其平均數算牠在五角左右吧，以目前一般人民購買力之薄弱，希望他們能多買一點非常時的讀物，一定是不可能的。但定期刊物則不然，不論月刋，半月刋，或週刋，全年定價至多二塊錢——國外例外——而每月供給的字數，却在十萬字左右，多者甚且達十五萬字，其所出的代價與所得的權利，和一般出版物相較，其相差之鉅，實堪驚人。所以從經濟的觀點而言，定期刋物更是非常時期的最適宜的刋物了。　　定期刋物之適宜於担負起非常時期的敎育大衆的責任，旣如上述，現在我們不妨進一步的討論，定期刊物在非常時期內，究應供給那幾種材料？現在試擬定如此，敬請讀者指正。　　第一，革命的哲學與革命的理論之闡述；　　第二，組織民衆與訓練民衆方法上的論述；　　第三，國內外時事系統的評述；　　第四，社會科學與自然科學原理的和應用的說明；　　第五，軍事常識的灌輸。　　假定一本定期刋物，以上述五大類為目標，供給這五大類中一切扼要的知識，那麽至少能比較地接迎於我們理想中的刋物了。　　定期刋物雖然可負起這非常的敎育大衆的工作，不過，僅一部份而已，决不是全部，因為定期刋物所供給的材料，往往是一般的，概要的；倘使我們要給一般民衆以比較高深的詳盡的訓練材料，那麽决不是定期刋物所担負得了，而有待於各書局出版的專籍了。書店雜景（績）  李衡之　　　　　廣吿術　　在本刋數期前，曾有人提出書報評論的問題，希望有嚴正的書報評諭，來指示讀者選擇新書，實則在今日，除少數例外，所謂書報評論，也祗是書店的廣吿術之一種。所以來談談書店的廣吿術。　　每個書店，大部均有廣吿部，聘有專人設計。我們大家週知的書店廣吿，是：一，登報，二，發目錄及單頁廣吿，三，出雜詰，（大部雜誌的作用全在廣吿上面，）但是這僅是公開的，書店的廣吿術還多！有的雖不似廣吿，但事實上仍是宣傳，有的不過是不公開的而已。的略的說，至少有下面幾種：　　一，賣預的—有的倒不是為了收集現金，而是在使讀者知道，這書是這末重要，內容自然可靠，而又是這未便宜，可不要放過了機會。　　二，名人題字或介紹—這在過去是數見不鮮的，如出版一本書，請所謂名人學者也者，寫上幾句，卽可大登廣吿，什麽先生評語如何，某某敎授先生怎樣等等。現在商務的星期標準書，亦可視作本方法之別一種形式應用。　　三，優待方法—優待方法很多，最巧妙的無過於去年生活與開明所玩的把戲，開明優待生活各雜誌的定戶，生活優待開明因中學生的定戶，其目的無非各為自己的書作廣吿，拉生意，結果，竟至在報上吵起架來。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言提倡土貨運動  劍平　　曾發起「念二運動」的邰爽秋先生等，又喊出了「提倡土貨」的口號，還借文廟市立民眾教育館舉行了一次堂而皇哉的開幕典禮，並規定今年是「土貨第一年」。主要目的是救濟農村經濟的衰弱，自然毋可非議。便是他們規定的實施計畫中的四個大綱，也是很妥善的方法。第一調查各地著名土產，和改良土產；調查產銷狀況，和社會經濟狀況。和第三的舉行演講會，運動週，編行刊物，舉行展覽會等宣傳工作。都是很基本而且很澈底的工作。至於第二點推行作物優良品種，改進手工編織，改善蓄產，提倡農產製造等工作，也可以看到他們對土貨改良的重視。第四點是關於整個運動推行方面的，如介紹優良土貨，提倡產銷合作社，舉辦小本借貸，獎勵服用土貨等，也是急切有效的途徑。不過，我們仍很像對這提倡土貨運動有點疑問：這運動很像缺少點什麼似的。　　這缺少的，說句不客氣話，便是「基本的認識」。提倡國貨運動，在我們這國家已經不知鬧了多少次數，可是「婦女國貨年」，「學生國貨年」諸如此類的出乎意料之外的失敗的，成績已使我們寒心。土貨和國貨不是一條路的兩面嗎？不過土貨的注意點比較國貨更小一點，着重於農村的農產品吧。其實兩者的困難都決定於我們這次殖民地的國家的。在理論上我們不能否認這「土貨運動」是一個很有效的辦法，但實際上這理論仍障碍於目前的現實。農村經濟的補救，是要等待於整個國民經濟的復興的。在不斷的天災人禍的農村，農民們已經逃荒之不暇，還那里有辦法來整頓。現在的農村已不是可以埋頭閉門改造的時候的大自然的產兒。便算改造運動成功了，土貨已如願變成最良好的產品，但是會鬥得過洋貨嗎。會不會給傾銷政策的洋貨打倒？一般的購買力還沒有穩定的時候，貧困的人民怎能不貪便宜。同時，國家處在這給帝國主義凌遲的危機里，國權完全無保障，土貨是否可以順利提倡？與閉幕典禮同日晚報載：日本人在朝鮮設蔴績廠，大計劃製造，我國夏布因關稅重將受日貨淘汰。諸如此類的新聞正是針對着我們的國貨運動也好，土貨運動也好，而發的。我們的熱心國貨或土貨運動的先生們，難道沒有看到嗎？在給帝國主義剮刑下的中國，無論什麼復興的運動都會受到很大的阻碍的。這並不是反對土貨運動，不過向提倡得興高彩烈的先生們提一個「備忘錄」。——　　要有效地使一切運動進行無阻，先決問題在於謀民族的解放，主權的獨立，和被壓迫得喘息不過來的人們的抬頭！雀子  耳禾　　　雀子這東西本來是對我陌生的，（當然長年生活在都市中的人那能知道雀子的一切呢？）從去年到了這兒，我纔仿佛得了一個新朋友似的認出識了牠。當我放了課卷，丟了筆，寂坐在陰　的屋子裏抽一支烟的時候，這雀子的吱吱喳喳的聲音不但打不破我周遭的寂寞，日使我周遭的寂寞更深沉起來。王維的「鳥啼林愈靜」的詩境我也同樣地感得的。　　我的屋子本來是偏僻在一邊的，雖然向東，但聳立在屋子的東南角的便是孔廟，而冬天的太陽又是南偏得很遠，因此上午簡直見不到陽光，只一大塊可怕的孔廟的陰影橫在屋前。但雀子似乎特別喜歡這塊地方，牠們整天的在椽柱間喧噪着，「撲」的一聲飛下來了，又「撲」的一聲飛上去了。這一種釀製寂寞的振翼的聲音常常使我難耐到只想流我孤寂的眼淚。有時簡直放肆到沒有我存在一樣，牠們一隻兩隻的飛進我的屋子來，用着非常靈活的眼向我看看，但只短短的一瞬間又回過頭去用着不屑一視的目光在看別種東西了，當然，我在牠們的眼中只是一件不可中用的靜物。好多次，我憤怒到極頂了，等牠他們來到我的屋子後，我立刻敏捷地關起門來，狂暴地一聲大喊，這回牠們知道我的存在了，牠們驚恐得向玻璃窗上亂撞，甚至撞得口內流起血來，終於有的從孔隙處逃了出去，有的蹲伏着不再動顫了。我像一個勝利的戰士，我的嘴角掛上了笑，我得意，我用着傲慢的態度輕輕地喊：「這纔明白我的厲害，可憐的小東西！」於是牠們不再進我的屋子了，牠們站在椽柱間，吱吱喳喳的似乎相互警告着，相互會意似地只要一見我，驚奇的一瞥飛到較遠的地方去了。　　然而我感到寂寞了，彷彿一個勝利的戰士殺死了所有的敵人。我後悔，我用我整個的心來懺悔。　　今春重來我還是住在那間臥室裏，但雀子好像不忘舊仇人似的還是不敢飛進我的屋子，這　我悲哀，像失掉了什麼，我所感到的是無際的憂傷。每晨醒來，聽着吱吱喳喳的雀聲，我總想起那次受傷的雀子，以及口內流起來的血……於是白天我怕站在臥室裏了，就是改課卷，就是呆坐，我也得上辦公廳去。我和這批雀子的感情已經損傷到不可挽回的地步了。　　但在別處我又發現了雀子。去年我是在第二膳堂用飯的，今年在第一膳堂用飯了。第一膳堂是一所又高又古的屋子。也許是春寒的緣故吧，許多雀子老愛站在膳堂裏的大樑上。牠們吱吱喳喳的旁若無人的樣子，簡直同我臥室前的雀子沒有不同之點的。在我們用飯前後牠們吵鬧得特別厲害，二十餘張桌子中只要有一桌人全走光了，牠們便迅捷地從樑上飛下來找殘餘的米粒子吃，牠們一跳一跳的，假設人們不逼近牠們的身邊，牠們是不會飛去的。就是偶然飛去，也只在樑上略略站一會，隨即「撲」的一聲又飛下來了。膳堂的前面又沒有門，只一長排的木柵，就是到了最緊急的關頭，牠們也可自由的飛去的。　　然而我沒有傷害牠們的心意了，我甚至故意多遺漏一點米粒子在桌子上給牠們吃。只要牠們並不畏懼我，我就會有一顆「愉快的心」了。瞎話  （吹）　　王寵惠留粵，與各方交換意見，王表示，胡展堂因春寒暫不入京。譚老三曰，只聽見小姐脚底響，不看見小姐下樓來，不知葫蘆裏賣甚麼藥？眞是丈二長和尚，令人摸不着頭路。　　崇明縣屬的嵊泗島劃治問題，江浙兩方，爭執甚烈。譚老三譚西廂記哭宴云，只爲　角虛名，蠅頭微利，拆鴛鴦坐兩下里，一個這壁，一個那壁，一遞一聲長吁氣，眞是好看煞人。師娘  時玳　　　我十二歲那年，父親便把我送到青龍鎮小爐匠徐三聾子家裏學手藝。　　那時師傅徐三聾子並不教我小爐匠的活兒，老吩咐我掃院子，喂豬，喂牲口，澆菜，打水……這樣一個月過去了，第二個月開始時，他才教我生火爐，打　子。　　漸漸的師娘對師傅有些不滿了！　　你不能把徒弟自己使喚，我沒有幫手是不行的！　　師傅是以怕老婆出名的，當然師娘的話他無不唯命是聽。　　於是師娘就把我當作了他唯一的工具。</p>

<p>天不亮她就隔着窗戶喊：　　阿奎！起來生爐子！不要忘了，先給性口添把草。　　祇要她一喊我，就得馬！起來，按着她吩咐的一樣一樣的去做。　　喂過牲口，就生火，有時我故意把鉗子在砧子上使勁的敲，那準挨她一頓駡：　　—八王羔子！要行兇嗎？你媽傷天理啦，養出你這塊賤骨頭！　　她火氣大了的時候就整天不讓我吃東西。可是營生照樣要我去做。　　到了過節我父親拿着禮物來看他們時，她就對我父親說得天花亂墜，說我的心性好，心機又靈，嘴不饞身子也不懶。她還說：你放心，到三年滿徒出去，保管比他師傅强得多！　　憐憫永遠不會在她心頭爆發，她有着婦人特有的苛毒心，不管對誰她都有一般浸人肺腑的冷酷！似乎所有的世人都使他瞧不起和討厭，在她眼裏的入物都是懦弱的蠢貨！所以她有堅硬的性格，一舉一動都足以表現出她要把整個世界攬入己手。對於丈夫她運用蠱惑的機智，操縱着丈夫的理性的主權的行使。任性的苛毒使她丈夫忍屈受辱的吞啖着不斷迫來的痛苦。　　她自己沒有兒女，也討厭別人有兒女，如果鄰家的女人生了孩子，她就咳嘆的說一大片沒人理會的閒話。　　—該遭刦啦！人這麽多了還儘着養，總有一天人多得沒處站，那就要塌天了，把這些人通通壓死……　　每天吃過晚飯，她就呌我推磨：　　—包米麵子又沒有了，磨點明天好吃，看你偌賊相兒！推推磨還累着你了嗎！　　有時她又好像很關心我似的，講古事給我聽，要我學好，她說好漢不怕出身低，劉備是賣草鞋的出身，關公當年也推過小車子，給人家搬東西。……　　—沒水做晚飯了，快點去打呀！　　要是我把一條　子打完再去打水，她就駡起來：　　—你這懶骨頭！你耳朶長毛了嗎？吩咐你老半天你不去，你敢和我鬧氣嗎？指望你好生學學手藝，學學怎麼做入，長大成人就可以靠手藝混飯吃，成家立業！你偏不爭氣，成天仔好吃懶做，別人的話當做耳旁風……　　夜裏我剛脫衣服躺下，她又喊我起來，把鷄窩關好，給牲口添草。　　我忍耐着，長串的日子都在忍耐中消磨了。我底朋友  黑丁　　黃昏。我從四馬路一家書店出來，在回家的路上，當我剛踏上天后宮橋，忽然，我底視錢被一個靑年的臉色擋上了。我站下。我開始用我底記憶的眼來觀察那個靑年的臉色。我彷彿做了一個夢，但那個靑年也似乎被我底臉色有所打動，他是微笑着默然的面對着我。他沒有說一句話。他的眼裏流滿着熱愛的情意。當他不自然的伸出他底發抖而寬大的手掌，緊緊的握着我底手時，我恍然似的才十分確信他是我底朋友。　　「呵，老李，你啥時離開北平？」我瘋狂一般的笑了。　　但他並沒有立刻回答我。他把我問他的話放在一旁，却吃力的裂着嘴皮在對我開始這樣脫：　　「我來上海了，然而上海就是一個深廣的大海…我如今沉在海底下！我掙扎，我跳躍……」　　他的話給我底心境加滿了一層憂鬱的黑雲。我瞪大了眼睛去望天空：天空落着濛濛的細雨。我又低下頭，這時蘇州河的黃濁的水面，幻起一層浮蕩的烟霧，猶如一張灰白色的網。天漸漸的黑暗了。上海總商會的大鐘已經指過五點了。我噓了一口深長的氣。我想了想我剛才問過他的話，他沒有回答我，我懷疑他是沒有聽見我的話。於是我又：「那麽你啥時離開北平？」　　「呵，呵，一個多月了。」用着低沉的悲哀的口吻。　　雨落得擴大了。我瞧了瞧他的頭髮，濕得活像一團軟棉。同時我又用手來摸了摸自己的頭髮，也是淹濕淹濕的。我們不能再停留在橋上了。於是我們的脚步沿着北河南路滑動着。我們害冷，而且冷得渾身直發戰。他只是穿着一套破舊的西裝，連伴大衣都沒有。他把他的手揷在褲袋裏。我們一邊走一邊談話，先由各人的生活談起，又從生活談到我們的生路，這時他顯然有些不安了。他把手從褲袋裏拖出來，呌着，呵，他痛恨得他的兩眼開始流淚了。　　「你不應該趁這時離開北平。」　　「那有什麽不應該呢。我並不是逃避北平的黑暗，我也不是厭煩我北平的久居。我只覺得我需耍多走些地方。」　　「你這决來上海的路費怎麽籌備的？」　　「路費？哼，我沒有地方籌備。我在路上是飽嘗了人生的酸苦與冷情。我沒有錢買火車票，所以我坐在火車上，常我被查票員查出，於是我就被人家趕下車來，交給到達的那一站的站長來處分我。這樣，我照例要吃站長的一頓嘲笑，辱駡。最後，我便厚着臉皮走出車站。可是，等下决火車一進站，我又偸偸摸摸的爬上車去。總之，我的主意是坐一叚算一叚，查出來我就下車，這對我的人格並沒有損害……　　走到寳山路，他說他餓了，於是我用我腰袋裏所僅有的三毛大洋請他到一家小飯館吃了一頓飯。吃完了飯，我們便分了手。我目送着他的背影，他的背影是在夜雨中移動，移動。　　三天以後。我接到一張欠資的信條，當我跑到大統路郵局付上四分欠資把信取出來，拆開一看，却正是他的來信。那封信的字句，使我不能够安心讀下去。他說他什麽東西也沒有了，連一枝自來水筆都當掉了。晚上睡在地板上，沒有什麽舖，也沒有什麽蓋。他整整有一天半沒吃飯…讀完了他的信，結果我把衣服當了三塊大洋給他送去。誰知就在我給他錢的第二天，我又接到他的來信，那只是寥寥的幾句話：　　「丁：　　我感謝你。我永遠不會忘記你。從明天起，我又要踏上我底艱苦的流浪的路了。我不應該不和你作最後一决的見面。請你原諒我。你靜靜的期待我走後的消息吧——震。」播音話劇　　虫聲社　　交通（二三〇〇）下午六時至七時　　播出者　　陳夏娃……珏芬　　皮羅傑……吳鍍　　陳艾華……孫歛　　陳夫入……小竹　　白古沙……韓白　　夏娃與蘋菓　　陳先生的女兒陳夏娃，是一個　眞爛漫的女孩子。她和新聞記者皮羅　發生了愛情。有一天，她倆總因陳先生的反對，而偷偷的私奔了。陳先生也就和陳夫人緊追出來。夏娃跟　　走了很遠的路，到達雙瀑旅店？他倆將汽車藏在路邊　走進旅店，預備休息一下，而且觀賞一　瀑布的勝景，道時剛巧有電話打到旅店來，把旅店的主人白古沙從夢中驚醒了，他聽着電話，回答說；「是這樣的事嗎！好了，我來替你截着。……　點鐘　　定！交給我吧」！夏娃和羅傑聽了，很吃驚，以為陳先生叫警察追來了。　　古沙回過頭來，見了夏娃和羅傑，就，叫他上去了。他倆就商量想把行李從窗戶丟下去溜之太吉。然而夏娃的肚子餓了，一定要吃了晚餐，再走，並且還想吃一只蘋菓。　　　沙下樓　羅條寫掛號車。羅傑將自己的眞姓名寫上了　古沙就知道她倆是一對私奔的情侶　他就聲明替他倆保守秘密，於是他倆決定吃了飯後去觀賞瀑布。　　夏娃和羅傑到樓上洗手去，這時陳先生和陳夫人找到雙瀑旅店來，古沙認識陳先生是他的老朋友；但古沙仍將夏娃他倆隱瞞了，說旅店裏沒有一個客人。　　陳先生還想追去，陳夫人一定不答應。這時陳先生接到了一個電話，說夏娃他倆在金鷄大旅社。陳先生正要走出旅店，但羅傑從樓上奔下來，嘴裏喊着夏娃的名字。陳先生拉住羅傑，問她要夏娃；羅傑也問陳先生要夏娃，他說：『她說她一刻兒就回來，但是她沒有回來」。後來羅傑突然想起夏娃會去觀瀑布去，他們就追出去。但羅傑正跨出門，又見夏娃從左方的門走出來，他就獨自回進門來。夏娃說她去看瀑布回來後，去過廚房，向廚子要了一個蘋菓吃。　　羅傑吿訴她陳先生追來了，她立刻預備逃走。她倆走上樓去。…　　陳先生他們回來後，見了條子，以為夏娃已逃走，更責備古沙，憤憤地回家了。這時古沙也以為夏娃已逃走，但當夏娃從樓上下來，他倒嚇了一跳。於是夏娃知道他的父母已回去，他和羅傑已脫離危險，就安安樂樂地在旅店享受着新婚的甜蜜。…邢俊明「落霞孤騖」　　華興（一二六〇）下午七時至八時　　用金戲婢自求辱　　怨言無訴服烟膠歌唱　　聯藝社　　東陸（六四〇）下午四時一刻至五時一刻　　妹妹我怪你（姚莉）嫁給勇士吧（戴萍）病中吟（白雪雪）警鐘（秦燕）戰歌（嚴化）花想容（姚莉）從軍別愛（戴萍）蘇武牧羊（白雪雪）你的愛情（秦燕）愛如花月（嚴化）（姚莉）　　都會歌劇社　　大陸（六二〇）下午八時三刻至九時半　　休息五分鐘（姚綉韻）賣花詞（靜韻）劍鋒之下（姚綉韻）浮雲掩月（若蕙）愛情如玫瑰（若蘭）心琴曲（若蕙）彈詞　　蔡筱舫毛家書　　中西（〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「美人風箏」　　二月春光氣候新。大風吹下步虛聲。昂頭遙望雲天外。上有雲梯足可登。我看他，萬里鵬程欣得志。扶搖直上駕靑雲。都只為，東風有意多抬舉。出盡風頭逈不羣。一幅仙裙留燕燕。幾聲雅奏和鶯鶯。正不知，何處吹蕭卉玉笙。此曲原非天上有。都說道，美人歌舞善調箏。試看那，翩翩宛若驚鴻影。輕似凌空飛燕身。好比是，蔡女文姬十八拍。好比是，湘靈鼓瑟響錚錚。好比是，琵琶一曲昭君怨。好比是，紅綫多才盜盒輕。目看他，素絹剪裁衣袖薄。凌波　襪凈無塵。一雙玉臂隨風舞。喜學摩登體態輕。都為是，無賴狡童輕　樣。綠珠防作墜樓人。只恐怕，楊枝柔弱嬌無力。故而，一縷紅絲繫足繩。有時節，風在顚倒空翻影。戲作楊妃出浴身。不是廬山眞面目。　涯何處覓知音。倘然是</p>

<p>Tokyo – Arita, after returning to the Japanese Embassy at 5:30 PM on the 18th, met with visiting reporters and stated that from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM this afternoon, he conferred with Foreign Minister Zhang. Because Minister Zhang had already explained China's hopes for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations on the 17th, the meeting on the 18th was for him to express Japan's hopes for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. He will still need to have a final meeting with Minister Zhang regarding this discussion on the 19th, and then both sides will issue a statement on the evening of the 19th. He plans to visit President Chiang on the morning of the 20th to bid farewell and return home. When reporters inquired about the progress and feelings of the talks with Foreign Minister Zhang over the past three days, Arita smiled and said that this would have to wait until after he concluded the talks with Foreign Minister Zhang on the 19th, and he would mention it in the statement. It is inconvenient to express anything at this time. He also said that the significance of the decision to convene a consular conference in Shanghai is because he originally intended to visit various places to inspect overseas Chinese affairs after arriving in China, but he has now been ordered to return home and has been unable to go elsewhere, so he summoned officials to Shanghai to listen to reports on the situation in various parts of your country. His itinerary after this is planned to be a visit to President Chiang on the 20th, followed by going to Shanghai that night. On the afternoon of the 23rd at 4:00 PM, he will depart from Shanghai by train to Tianjin, and then return home via Korea. Reporters also inquired whether Foreign Minister Hirota had previously issued three principles for diplomacy towards China, and whether he had explained these principles to Minister Zhang when he met with Minister Zhang. Arita said that this was certainly discussed, but it was also very broad. In the first day's meeting, general discussions were held on the world situation and the mutual relations between China and Japan, and the Hirota principles were also mentioned. When reporters further inquired about his feelings on this point of discussion, Arita said that the discussion had not yet reached concrete measures, nor was it based on Hirota's proposed three principles. He and Minister Zhang were talking as friends, and the contents would not be disclosed. However, what can be said is that there were areas where both sides' opinions were close, as well as areas where they were not. As for the scope of the discussion, it fully encompassed all issues between China and Japan. Arita said he could not explain further and stated that there was no problem between China and Japan in adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, but the issue was which method would be appropriate. He believed that the conference method was not suitable, so it had been decided not to adopt a conference format, and Minister Zhang of your country shared the same sentiment.

<p>Tokyo - Premier Hirota initially intended to strengthen the position of the Japanese Foreign Ministry to solidify East Asian stability and maintain and develop the people's right to survival. He is about to implement an independent and active diplomatic policy and is selecting newly advanced and energetic diplomats from within the province to appoint as dedicated premiers. Therefore, he has decided to appoint Ambassador to China Arita Hachiro. After the ambassador concludes his negotiations with the National Government, he will return home in early April and personally assume the position of Foreign Minister before the special assembly. The reason why Premier Hirota appointed Ambassador Arita as the dedicated Foreign Minister is that the policy towards China is the foundation of Japan's foreign policy. By centering on China, he seeks to actively adjust international relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia, and to reflect the fundamental policy of the Hirota Cabinet to seek the national development of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in cooperation.

<h3 id="e13">Saving Beggars and Relieving the Poor <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of beggars on the roads of Shanghai has increased. The way to deal with them is that District A always drives them to District B, and District B drives them to District C. However, those who are driven away can return, so how can driving them away be exhausted? Most of the beggars in Shanghai come from the mainland. In recent years, disasters in the mainland have continued, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and people's lives have been difficult, so they have no choice but to seek a way out in big cities. However, the industries in the cities are depressed, there are many unemployed, and the difficulty of making a living is no different from that in the countryside. In this environment of agricultural and commercial difficulties, the poor have no way to live and become beggars. In addition, there are also many beggars from the local shantytowns. The hard-earned income of these shantytowns is not enough to maintain a family, and they rely entirely on the begging of the elderly, young, women, and children to supplement their lives. Therefore, not only can the beggars in Shanghai not be driven away, but they cannot be saved enough. In the past, there were nursing homes to accommodate the lonely and the elderly and to provide shelter for vagrants, so as to stop vagrants. Today, there are also places for the disabled, the elderly, and vagrants to learn skills, so it cannot be said that there are no facilities for relieving the poor and saving beggars. However, how many can be accommodated? It is known without saying that it is very limited.</p>
<p>Now, considering social security and the human obligation of mutual assistance, beggars cannot be without more effective relief. The way to provide relief lies in seeking economic prosperity, so that everyone has the opportunity to make a living, and then the elderly, the young, and the disabled will know where to be supported. However, this is an entire social problem and cannot be discussed today. Under the current situation, we must urgently seek to improve the policy of saving beggars. If all parties in Shanghai can work together, this problem will not be difficult to solve to a considerable extent. For example, establish a large-scale skills learning center that can accommodate three to four thousand people, teach them a skill, and enable them to support themselves. If such a plan cannot be realized for a time due to funding reasons, then we should support the poor's livelihood and expand small loans. We should widen the scope of small street vendors and reduce their donations. Those who do not hinder the safety of road traffic should not be banned. Those who engage in small-scale hawking and selling of scattered goods should not be fined. If the poor have one more way to make a living, there will be fewer who become beggars and thieves.</p>

<p>Nanjing - The important contents of the Organization Law of the Ministry of Finance, which has been amended and passed by the joint committee of the Legislative Yuan, are as follows: The Ministry of Finance will still set up two departments, the Customs Department and the Tax Department. The current Salt Affairs Department will be changed to the Salt Administration Division. In addition, six divisions will be set up: the General Affairs Division, the Taxation Division, the Public Debt Division, the National Treasury Division, and the Currency Division. The current Accounting Division will be abolished, and it will not be renamed the Audit Division. Another accounting office will be set up, headed by an accounting officer, who will be directly responsible to the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, in order to comply with the spirit of accounting independence. The customs revenue collection agency will still be handled by the Directorate-General of Customs. The salt tax revenue collection agency will reorganize the current Salt Affairs Audit Office into the Salt Affairs Bureau to handle the collection of national salt tax and all other salt affairs, and concurrently manage saltpeter and sulfur affairs. The bureau will have a director-general and a deputy director, and will set up five sections: General Affairs, Taxation, Production and Sales, Tax Police, and Management. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will set up a Customs Tariff Committee. The duties and personnel distribution of the various departments and divisions are not very different from the current law. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Full Text Divided Into Six Articles, Implementation Limited to Six Months, Negotiations Between Tianjin Customs and Jinpu Railway for Anti-Smuggling Also Nearing Completion <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The anti-smuggling measures agreed upon by the Tianjin Jinhai Customs and the BeiNing Railway Bureau will be implemented on the 21st. The announcement was made on the 18th. The original title is "Temporary Measures for BeiNing Railway to Assist Customs in Inspecting and Seizing Outbound Foreign Goods at Tianjin East and Main Stations." The original text consists of six articles, and the main points are summarized below:</p>
<p>For foreign goods shipped from Tianjin East and Main Stations that are not produced domestically, or are produced both domestically and abroad, and require railway assistance in inspection and seizure, the Customs shall provide a detailed list of names to the Railway Bureau to facilitate station assistance.</p>
<p>For the goods stipulated in Article 1, the Railway and Customs shall separately notify the merchants to declare taxes to the Customs or obtain a declaration certificate before shipment.</p>
<p>Railway stations shall verify the Customs' permission to transport certificates before accepting goods or parcels stipulated in Article 1. If the documents match, the goods can be inspected and transported. If there is no certificate, the documents do not match, or the Customs stamp is missing, the goods shall be refused transport. In special circumstances, consultations with Customs can be arranged at any time.</p>
<p>The Customs' permission to transport certificates shall be printed by the Railway Bureau and issued to merchants for completion, and then stamped by the Customs free of charge. This process must also be convenient for merchants.</p>
<p>Customs should dispatch personnel at any time to handle this matter without delay.</p>
<p>These measures shall be effective for six months from the date of implementation. After the expiration date, both parties will negotiate an extension or cancellation. If the Railway Bureau considers it obstructive, it may revise or cancel it at any time. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>The Tianjin BeiNing Railway Bureau announced on the 18th that the main points of the anti-smuggling law with the Customs are detailed in the Customs announcement. However, the railway stipulates that the Customs must provide a list of the goods to be inspected, and the limit is six months. If it is overdue or difficult to implement during the period, the railway may seek to abolish or revise it. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Jinhai Customs contacted the Jinpu Railway Tianjin office on the 18th to discuss anti-smuggling matters, based on the measures agreed upon with BeiNing. It was decided that the agreement would be approved on the 21st and implemented simultaneously. The office has telegraphed the head office for instructions, and there is no doubt that it will be approved. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Due to the peak season for cargo transport, the Tianjin station is piled high with goods waiting for southbound transport. Feng Heming, director of the Jinpu office, telegraphed the head office to report the situation. The railway estimates that revenue losses in the past two months have been significant. The Customs anti-smuggling efforts in eastern Hebei are expected to make up for the losses. The Tianjin station interception method is still planned to be used. The railway will pay attention to smuggled goods arriving in Tianjin and report to the Customs for detention and shipment. The specific measures will be decided by the Customs in consultation with BeiNing in the coming days. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Tianjin The Jinpu Railway's measures to assist Customs in anti-smuggling will be slightly modified based on the agreement between the BeiNing Railway and the Customs, with the principle of not hindering train operations. Customs is allowed to inspect goods that have not entered the factory at the Tianjin East, Main, and West stations. After approval from the head office, the Tianjin office will notify the Customs to handle it. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>Nanjing The Executive Yuan issued an order to all military and political agencies on the 18th, stating that civil servants must be appointed according to law. The original order stated, "Now is the time to vigorously reform politics, and all civil servants should be carefully screened and assessed. In the future, all military and political agencies must thoroughly investigate the experience of their employees before appointing them. Those who have been dismissed or removed due to cases, who are legally prohibited from being employed, and who have obvious bad records and are legally ineligible for employment, are not allowed to be misused. Those who have been wanted for crimes should be seriously dealt with. After the issuance of this order, if the appointment of such personnel is still found, the appointing officials who knowingly violate the law will be held accountable and severely punished. In addition to separate orders, this joint order is issued for compliance and for relay to subordinates for unified compliance." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Nanjing The Executive Yuan believes that in recent years, various agencies have arbitrarily wasted money, inflated prices, and engaged in serious malpractices when purchasing goods. On the 18th, it specifically ordered all heads of agencies to supervise their subordinates to purchase goods that are practical, to avoid wasting public funds, to give priority to purchasing domestic goods, and to use them sparingly. The handling personnel and accounts must be strictly audited to prevent inflated reporting, and detailed procedures for purchasing goods at specific prices and receiving goods must be specified in the handling regulations.

<p>London This correspondent has learned that British Foreign Secretary Eden submitted a British proposal this morning to French Foreign Minister Flandin and Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland. The purpose of this proposal is to guarantee the cooperation between Britain, France, and Belgium. There are two steps to its implementation:</p>
<p>1. The cooperation of the three countries aims to restore international security, as Germany's violation of treaties has endangered the international situation.</p>
<p>2. Once the international situation returns to security, Britain will pledge to assist France and Belgium in the current border security along the Rhine River and bear permanent responsibility for its protection. Germany may also join this three-country agreement in the future. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>London British Foreign Secretary Eden presented a suggestion to France and Belgium yesterday. According to diplomatic sources, the purpose of the suggestion is to "re-establish the spirit of international rule of law." Although the content is currently kept secret, this correspondent has learned the main points as follows:</p>
<p>1. Clearly condemn Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>2. The issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the Locarno Treaty should be decided by the German and French governments applying to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. However, the British suggestion does not seem to stipulate how to handle the situation if Germany refuses to accept the arbitration procedure or the court's ruling.</p>
<p>3. After resolving the above legal issues, a permanent security system should be organized along the Rhine River, such as: (a) designating demilitarized zones managed by an international military commission and international police; (b) Germany should not build defensive fortifications in these areas, and France should not increase its existing defensive fortifications.</p>
<p>4. A new treaty should be established, signed by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Each signatory country would mutually guarantee that its territory would not be violated by the air force of other signatory countries.</p>
<p>5. The air force armaments of each country should be limited.</p>
<p>The above suggestions should first be approved by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, and then submitted to the League of Nations Council for approval. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>London The British method proposed to seek peace in Western Europe was presented at 12:25 today by Chamberlain, Foreign Minister of the Locarno Treaty, Zeeland representing Belgium, Grandi representing Italy, and Flandin and Pongue, ministers without portfolio, representing France. According to reliable sources, the British proposed setting up neutral zones along the French-German and French-Belgian borders, with a width of 60 miles, 30 miles on each side of the border, and international military police managing the police affairs. In addition, there are other measures attached:</p>
<p>* France must not improve its existing artillery positions.</p>
<p>* Germany must not build artillery positions.</p>
<p>* If Germany is unwilling to submit the question of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the Locarno Treaty to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, then France may submit it. It is heard that the British proposal does not stipulate the withdrawal of the German troops in the Rhineland or the security of Central and Eastern Europe, but it does stipulate the security of Britain and France. Although many factors that cause anxiety in the current situation were recognized during today's meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, the fact that Germany has agreed to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting shows an optimistic atmosphere. British politicians are currently working to persuade other countries to agree to a procedure that can permanently resolve the situation in Western Europe. This effort is now receiving a lot of attention. Its success depends on the solidarity of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty. However, this solidarity is not aimed at Germany. It is considered necessary because the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty agree that progress towards a solution will fail or stall unless Britain and France agree on the extent of negotiations. Today's meeting was briefly suspended for lunch and continued in the afternoon to find a solution to reconcile the differences between France and Germany regarding the Rhineland occupation issue. Currently, the path to a final solution can be divided into three stages:</p>
<p>* The League of Nations stage, which is currently underway.</p>
<p>* The intermediate stage.</p>
<p>* The formal negotiation stage. It is generally believed that Britain must fully comply with the guarantee of border security given to France and Belgium in Locarno during the period before the final solution. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>London The meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty convened at 12:15 today. The French representative immediately presented a proposal containing five items:</p>
<p>1. The issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the Locarno Treaty can be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for a ruling, but the ruling of the court must be accepted.</p>
<p>2. The other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, should simultaneously declare that the obligations stipulated in the treaty remain in effect.</p>
<p>3. German troops stationed in the Rhineland region should withdraw a portion of their forces, and their artillery should be withdrawn to 50 kilometers east of the Rhine River, and no defensive fortifications should be built in the region.</p>
<p>4. Once Germany has fully fulfilled the above conditions, the countries concerned should begin negotiations with that country in May of this year.</p>
<p>5. Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium should immediately make a decision on the basis of this negotiation. According to this correspondent, the representatives of Britain and France have reached an agreement on the basis of negotiations mentioned above. Only a few key issues, such as the issue of Britain's military assistance to France and Belgium, remain to be resolved. The conclusion of an agreement by the general staff of the countries concerned is currently being considered, so that the British troops can occupy the Rhine region before the current negotiation results are achieved. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>London According to this correspondent, the proposal submitted by the British delegation to the Locarno Conference yesterday would maintain the current situation in the Rhineland region and request the League of Nations Council to make a claim, and submit the suggestions made in the German memorandum of March 7 for discussion, but exclude the first suggestion, that France and Belgium should establish demilitarized zones. At the same time, the countries concerned should begin negotiations with Germany in order to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. As for the issue of security guarantees for France and Belgium, the British proposal put forward four measures:</p>
<p>1. The security of the borders of France and Belgium will still be guaranteed by Britain.</p>
<p>2. The number of German troops stationed in the Rhineland region should not be increased, and no defensive fortifications should be built in the region.</p>
<p>3. The existing defensive fortifications on the French border will not be expanded, the number of existing troops will not be replenished, and no military exercises will be held in the Rhineland region.</p>
<p>4. The question of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the Locarno Treaty should be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a ruling. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>London After Germany accepted the League of Nations' invitation to participate in the Council meeting, the atmosphere has improved significantly. However, the fundamental issues remain unresolved, as France firmly insists that it must first obtain satisfaction before it can begin negotiations with Germany on its peace proposals. France demands three things:</p>
<p>1. Submit the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration on whether it violates the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>2. Appoint a League of Nations commission to go to the Franco-German border to prevent border disputes during the negotiations.</p>
<p>3. Britain guarantees the security of the borders of France and Belgium. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>London French Foreign Minister Flandin told visitors today that he would attend the League of Nations Council meeting on Thursday with the German representative, but would refuse to participate in peace talks on the issue of German reoccupation of the Rhineland until France is completely satisfied.

<p>London Regarding the issue of security guarantees for France and Belgium, British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Flandin have both put forward suggestions. The British suggestion to organize a permanent security system on both banks of the Rhine River and establish demilitarized zones within the borders of France and Belgium is truly shocking. After last night's meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, the British delegation abandoned the proposal to establish demilitarized zones within the borders of France and Belgium. Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland went to the British Foreign Office this morning to continue drafting a compromise plan with British personnel in order to reconcile the views of Britain and France. This compromise plan will be submitted for discussion at the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty at 12:30 noon today. Discussions will continue this afternoon. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>London Representatives of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty are currently discussing the issue of a new security system in the Rhineland region. It is heard that there are two methods:</p>
<p>1. The general staff of the countries concerned should conclude an agreement to ensure the security of the Rhine River area.</p>
<p>2. During the negotiations, the Rhineland region should be occupied by international troops, especially British troops. If the representatives of Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy can reach an agreement on these methods today, then experts from each country will copy the draft this week so that it can be submitted to the League of Nations Council for discussion on Monday next week. As for the suggestions made in the German memorandum of March 7, negotiations will begin in May of this year. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>London The chief German representative to the League of Nations Council meeting, Ribbentrop, is scheduled to arrive here at 5:00 this afternoon. At that time, the Council meeting will not have adjourned and he will be able to attend. As for the German ambassador to Britain, Hoesch, he may attend the meeting as an observer. However, the opinions of various countries may not be unanimous on the determination of Germany's breach of the treaty at tomorrow's Council meeting, and difficulties may arise. French Foreign Minister Flandin is scheduled to return to Paris at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. The Council meeting may be postponed until the 21st of this month (Saturday). At that time, the agenda will include four issues:</p>
<p>1. Discussion of the suggestions made by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>2. Voting on the condemnation of Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty (i.e., the joint resolution drafted by France and Belgium).</p>
<p>3. Approval of the submission of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a ruling.</p>
<p>4. Approval of the suggestions made by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty (excluding the two items of condemning Germany's abolition of the treaty and submitting it to The Hague court), and other methods. However, the Council does not have the responsibility to supervise the implementation of these methods. As for the suggestions made by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, experts from each country will sort them out before the Council meeting on Saturday, and representatives from each country will also return to their countries for instructions. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>London General Ribbentrop, Hitler's special commissioner, will be Germany's chief representative and will arrive in London today by special plane. The German representatives are Decker, director of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wallman, legal advisor, and Schrader and Schmidt, important officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, totaling fifteen people including secretaries and translators. Germany's decision to attend the League of Nations Council meeting was the result of an exchange of diplomatic telegrams between Britain and Germany in Berlin since yesterday morning. After the German government received a reply from the League of Nations Council stating that the Council could not handle Hitler's request to discuss his peace proposals, German Foreign Minister Neurath, through the British Ambassador to London, requested the British government to guarantee that it would do its best to discuss Hitler's proposals with the countries concerned to build European peace on a new basis. Yesterday afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Eden telegraphed Germany in reply, saying, "The British government is now and will continue to do its best to find a peaceful and satisfactory solution to the current difficulties. The British government knows that Hitler's proposals and any proposals put forward by other countries concerned must be discussed at the appropriate time, but the German government should understand that the British government is not in a position to give any clearer undertaking at this stage." Before exchanging diplomatic telegrams, Eden asked the German ambassador to London, Hoesch, to urge his government to send a delegation to attend the League of Nations Council meeting as soon as possible, and invited the ambassador to participate in last night's secret Council meeting as an observer. The ambassador did not attend because he had not received instructions from the German government.</p>
<p>The German reply agreeing to attend the League of Nations Council meeting arrived just as French Foreign Minister Flandin and Prime Minister Zeeland were urging an immediate discussion of their motion. As a result, the discussion was immediately shortened, but Flandin glanced at the meeting and declared that, in any case, the Franco-Belgian motion must be voted on tomorrow morning, as he had to return to Paris at noon on Thursday.</p>
<p>During last night's secret meeting of the League of Nations Council, Chairman Bruce informed the representatives present that he had urged the German Ambassador Hoesch to request his government to send a delegation to London as soon as possible so that they could participate in tomorrow's meeting.

<p>London Britain has achieved a diplomatic victory today, as the League of Nations Council has postponed the resolution to condemn Germany for violating the Locarno Treaty until this Thursday to avoid a stalemate caused by France and Belgium proposing sanctions against Germany. Chile supported Britain, insisting that the Council must refer the crisis to the International Court of Justice for judgment before condemning Germany. The representatives attending the Council now believe that the issue of sanctions has been temporarily shelved. The current focus of discussion is:</p>
<p>* Asking the International Court of Justice to judge whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is consistent with the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>* Finding a way to conclude a security agreement in the Rhineland region to replace the Locarno Treaty. The Council will continue to debate on Wednesday, at which time British Foreign Secretary Eden, Italian Ambassador Grandi, and Polish Foreign Minister Beck will all speak. German Ambassador Hoesch will also make a statement if he is authorized by Berlin. At the same time, the representatives of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty will continue negotiations based on the memoranda of Britain and France. Finally, an agreement may be reached, with Britain agreeing to automatically send troops to aid France if Germany attacks France. However, France still insists that it will not negotiate with Germany unless German troops withdraw from the Rhineland region. (National Telegram dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<p>A defense British Foreign Secretary Eden declared at today's League of Nations Council meeting on the motion proposed by France to condemn Germany, "Germany has indeed violated the treaty, and there is no denying it. Therefore, the Council can draw the same conclusion and send this determination to other signatory countries." Eden also said that the structure of security and trust has been greatly shaken, and Germany knows that trust is based on the belief in the dignity of treaties. Now that Germany has unilaterally abolished the treaty, international trust must wait until everyone makes a practical contribution before it can be restored. Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland said that we must strive to transform international life, which is a wise and courageous statement and is very welcome. He hoped that the people of the Council would cooperate with each other to maintain peace and respect the law. Britain will do its best in reorganizing the security of Western Europe. Italian representative Grandi said that Italy understands the legitimate anxiety of France and Belgium and is willing to faithfully fulfill its guarantee, but Italy cannot join the plans that its people are now encountering. The resolution of the Geneva dispute over Italy and Abyssinia has weakened the political basis of Locarno. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Striving to Defend the Franco-Soviet Agreement <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>London Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke at the League of Nations Council meeting last night, his words were quite long, strongly condemning Hitler's peace proposals and defending the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement, pointing out that it did not conflict with the League of Nations Charter or the Locarno Treaty. He said that if the League of Nations obeyed the aggressor countries' disregard for its suggestions, warnings, and advice, it would not be able to exist if this continued. He did not know whether the League of Nations could allow it to promote its goal of establishing its hegemony over all of Europe. No country in the world wants to attack Germany. Those who view Germany's proposal for a non-aggression pact as a sign of peace-loving have almost forgotten that the Locarno Treaty that Germany tore up was also a non-aggression pact. Those who conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany will not be able to act when Germany attacks a third country. Therefore, we must wait until we are sure that the concerns held by those [unsure of Germany's intentions] are unfounded before we can consider Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations as a move beneficial to peace. Hitler's proposals are tantamount to unfavorable propaganda against the people of the countries represented by Russia. Russia is prepared to participate in the plans proposed by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty and supported by other countries on the Council. Litvinov went on to say that the British and Italian governments both view this agreement as not conflicting with the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty, but Germany even pointed out that the interpretations of Britain, Belgium, France, and Italy are all incorrect, and only its own interpretation is correct. We must maintain an international compromise that can not only consolidate the existing foundations of peace but also create new foundations. We are also willing to participate in compromises established by various countries with the same purpose, but we do not want to hear about countries that withdraw from the League of Nations or destroy international treaties being given the privilege of dominating all of Europe. The Turkish representative spoke and said that the League of Nations Council is not only a peacemaker, but also bears the responsibility of guaranteeing peace. The Chilean representative spoke after the Russian Foreign Minister, saying that if the Council pays due attention to the act of destroying the Locarno Treaty, Chile is willing to fulfill its responsibilities without hesitation. The Council meeting then adjourned until 3:30 this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>of being able to tolerate its increasing [power]. The world has never had a country wanting to attack Germany. Those who view the suggestion for Germany not to aggress are people who appreciate peace, and almost forgot that the Locarno covenant that Germany tore up was a non-aggression covenant. Those who have made non-aggression pacts with Germany will not be able to act at the time Germany attacks a third nation. Therefore, we individuals must wait for a period of time, and then think about Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations, as that would be a deed beneficial to peace. Hitler's recommendation of war would not be beneficial to any of the nations in the world that Russia represents. Russia prepares to be at the Locarno conference, and join with the proposals that have been given by the signatory nations, as well as by the leaders of other nations in the administration. Litvinov continued in reference to the French-Russian mutual support agreement, saying England and Italy took this as a non-contradictory agreement regarding League of Nations resolutions and the Locarno covenant, but Germany insisted on this, and the officials of England, Belgium, France and Italy all took these as incorrect, and only they had the correct view. Every single international compromise that can solidify already existing peace agreements, and also create new foundations, needs to be maintained by us. Every compromise that many nations establish for themselves, we are also willing to participate in it, but for nations that pull out of the League of Nations or destroy international treaties, if we actually grant privileges over all of Europe, then we would not hear of it [being a good idea]. A representative from Turkey said at the administration conference that the League of Nations administration would be a peacemaker, and also take up the responsibility of guaranteeing peace. After Russia's foreign minister spoke, a representative from Chile said that in the administration office they took suitable note to destroy agreements under the Locarno covenant, and Chile is willing to not hesitate and do its duty. The administration conference then adjourned and would resume this afternoon at 3:30. (Reuters electricity).</p>
<h3 id="e49">German Minister of Aviation States: Rhine Garrison Will Not Withdraw, Industrial Self-Sufficiency, Not Afraid of Sanctions <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Koluoye: Minister of Aviation Göring delivered a speech today in Kiel, Germany, to 15,000 people (including governors and high-ranking military officers from major towns in the region), saying that we do not want war, but only a peaceful life. The troops here will be stationed permanently and will not withdraw. We are willing to have peaceful talks with other countries, but what we do in our own country is none of their business. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Dortmund, Germany: Minister of Aviation and Governor-General of Prussia, General Göring, delivered an election speech here tonight. His conclusion was most concise, saying, "The German army, having entered the Rhine region today, will naturally be stationed there permanently and will never withdraw. As long as Germany exists, we will be its masters. No one can interfere in Germany's affairs." Göring first said, "The whole world cannot condemn us. Whether we have the right to do what we have done is not for anyone to judge. As for whether Germany has violated the treaty, the Führer Hitler has entrusted the responsibility of judging it to the German people." Göring then described the achievements of the National Socialist Party in power, saying, "New factories have sprung up all over the country, and chemical technicians are working tirelessly to enable Germany to be self-sufficient and not dependent on foreign raw materials. Even if other countries impose sanctions on Germany, their effectiveness will be zero. We will travel to remote areas and persuade the people to resist together. At that time, the people will know how to be loyal to the country and will not be greedy for food. Even if only one sour apple remains, its taste will not be less than that of a large piece of beef. Other countries now want our country to make a gesture of peace and withdraw five battalions of the Rhine garrison. It should be known that the Führer Hitler has already proposed that Western Europe conclude a 25-year non-aggression treaty, and that Eastern Europe also conclude non-aggression pacts with neighboring countries. This is a further step than merely expressing peace. However, they still want our country to withdraw its troops. How can such ridiculous demands be compared with the proposal made by the Führer Hitler? This proposal may be the last chance to save peace in Europe. The French people now also know that these proposals are peaceful, just, and not to be condemned. But there is one country (referring to the Soviet Union) that holds a different opinion. Why is this?" At this point, Göring attacked the Soviet Union with fierce words, which were consistent with the repeated statements of the German authorities. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>London: British Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon presented the aviation budget in the House of Commons today, totaling £39,000,000, an increase of £13,013,000 compared to the 1935 budget. This is the largest figure submitted to Parliament since the European War. Sassoon said that the British Air Force currently has the fastest single-seat fighter in the world, with a speed of over 300 miles per hour. In addition to this new single-seat fighter, there is also one currently being tested, and its speed will be comparable. The Air Force has three types of medium bombers, all of which are expected to perform well. According to the current program, Britain will have 123 squadrons of aircraft, including 1,500 first-line aircraft, and will have sufficient reserves of the latest aircraft. Under this expanded plan, the Air Force will need 2,500 pilots, 500 of whom can be recruited from current serving airmen, and the rest will need to be recruited from those engaged in civil aviation. The ground personnel will need 22,500, of whom 14,500 have already been hired, and the rest are newly recruited. In addition, 12 squadrons will need to be formed to serve overseas. In the next three years, more new aircraft will be acquired than in the past 17 years. It is expected that in a short period of two years, the strength of the first-line air force can be doubled. The equipment of the British Air Force is not inferior to that of other countries. Sassoon also detailed a new method in the construction of British aircraft and then spoke about civil aviation, saying that the navigation plan for flying across the Atlantic is planned to begin testing this year. If it cannot be held, it will be held at the latest in the early part of next year. Sassoon concluded by saying that the British government has not abandoned the hope of concluding a Western air pact and hopes that a larger treaty can be established in the future. The House of Commons then passed the budget by a vote of 170 to 47, rejecting the Labour Party's motion to reduce personnel. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

The vehicle is equipped with the latest weapons, and the wheels are dual-purpose, either using ordinary round wheels to advance or changing to a crawling vehicle form, depending on the terrain. The vehicle body is not large but is not easily destroyed. In addition, the German army also has a large number of high-speed motorized bicycles.

<p>London: The drafting committee appointed by the General Committee of the Naval Conference met today to discuss the initial draft of the British, French, and American naval treaty. The opinions expressed by the members were still focused on the issue of the safeguard clause. After the wording of this clause is revised, it will be reprinted and submitted for discussion at the meeting tomorrow morning. According to inquiries from our reporters, the draft naval treaty contains 40 articles, divided into four chapters. The first chapter concerns the exchange of information on shipbuilding programs among the signatory countries. The second chapter concerns the age of various types of ships. The third chapter concerns the various principles of qualitative restrictions on various types of ships. The fourth chapter is the so-called safeguard clause. Most of this safeguard clause is based on the third chapter of the Washington Naval Treaty, with necessary revisions to suit the times and meet needs. That is, when the shipbuilding program of a non-signatory country exceeds the various figures stipulated in the future naval treaty, the signatory country concerned may notify the other signatory countries and consult with each other to decide on countermeasures.

<h3 id="e55">Hirota Cabinet's Political Program is Impractical, Various Circles in Japan Express Disappointment, Military Supervises Implementation, Financial Circles Wait and See, House of Peers Regrets Failure to Eliminate the Military, Political Parties Expect Establishment of Concrete Policies <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The statement of the new cabinet's political program and policies, which various sectors had been eagerly awaiting, was finally released last night after a temporary cabinet meeting. Its content was contrary to general expectations, and its content remained extremely abstract. It failed to serve as a guideline for the general financial community in the future. At a time when important commodity circles are spreading the implementation of tax increases and controlled economy, it did not involve any concrete issues. Therefore, the people can only observe the government's actions and wait for its results. However, the industry may inevitably be opaque and unstable. However, with the strong support of the military, if it has the ability to implement decisively, there may be some credibility. (Telecommunications dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the army's opinion, although the Hirota cabinet has revealed an abstract political program, it is important to implement it. Once the government declares a political program, it must realize innovative policies in all aspects of politics. The army will seriously monitor the process of its concretization and will therefore whip the government at any time to urge it to adopt positive policies.</p>
<p>The navy's first requirement in the new political program is to realize the enrichment and strengthening of national defense. The necessary expenses have already been included in the supplementary budget. Japan has entered an unconditional state since the twelfth year and has begun to build new battleships to replace the old ones. Therefore, budget expansion is inevitable. However, the stability and improvement of the people's lives are also urgent matters. The government must realize this plan in the shortest possible time. (Allied dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The new financial and economic policies declared by the Hirota cabinet only vaguely stated various items such as improving finance, reforming the tax system, and developing industry and trade. It reduced and abstracted the statement made by Finance Minister Baba when he took office and did not point out any specific paths. The economic and financial circles have no other way but to wait and see the concrete implementation of the policies. (Allied dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Rengo Daima, the leader of the Minseito Party, criticized the Hirota cabinet's announcement of its political program, saying that we expected the government to release a political program that would stabilize the people's hearts and renew their minds. However, after reading the entire text, its content was too abstract, which is regrettable. However, the government's optimistic view of the internal and external situation and its determination to renew all administrations and break the deadlock can be understood. In short, it is important to implement, not to declare. It is hoped that the government will establish concrete policies as soon as possible based on this spirit and break the extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Matsuno, the secretary-general of the Seiyukai Party, expressed his views, saying that the so-called political program released by the Hirota cabinet can be agreed upon in terms of its spirit. However, what the people expect from the new government is how to enrich the government's policies. It is hoped that the government will actively study and implement concrete policies as soon as possible based on this spirit. The criticisms from the House of Peers are as follows: The government's political program did not touch on the work of eliminating the military, which is disappointing. The Saito and Okada cabinets also issued grand statements, but they turned into empty words. The previous two cabinets were always buried in the current difficult problems and events and forgot the initial tense spirit. We hope that the current cabinet will maintain the current tense spirit for a long time and faithfully implement the contents declared in the statement. (Allied dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official sources, Prime Minister Hirota, in order to rapidly materialize the policies predetermined with the military when the cabinet was formed, plans to organize a five-minister conference consisting of the Prime Minister, the Army Minister, the Navy Minister, the Finance Minister, and the Foreign Minister in the shortest possible time, following the example of the Saito Cabinet.

<p>Tokyo: Starting from the principle that Japan and Manchuria are inseparable, the government announced in its policy on the 17th that it would innovate its diplomatic policy. The key point is to take the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria as the basis and promote the actual achievements of stabilizing forces in East Asia. The government's previous diplomatic policy was to implement diplomatic work first and then wait for the opportunity to come before engaging in diplomacy. Now, it has decided to abandon this policy and actively implement its beliefs, resisting all obstacles and opposition, in order to establish a groundbreaking independent diplomacy that has never been seen in the 80 years since the opening of the country. To explain it concretely, based on the spirit of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol, it will enrich the military strength stationed in Manchuria, cooperate with Manchuria to eliminate external oppression, and at the same time adjust the diplomatic relations of the Soviet Union and China surrounding "Manchukuo." In diplomatic relations with Russia, it will resolve the withdrawal of troops from the Manchurian-Mongolian border and border disputes. In relations with China, it will aim to realize the Three Principles for the purpose of Sino-Japanese friendship and harmony. In addition, because Japan is responsible for stabilizing East Asia, the British and American governments must obtain the understanding of the Japanese government when engaging in political or economic activities in East Asia. For the United Kingdom and the United States, it will adjust diplomatic relations with a focus on East Asian issues. Foreign Minister Hirota, who also serves as the Foreign Minister, has injected this diplomatic spirit into the ambassadors and ministers of various countries stationed in Japan. How the various countries will respond to Japan's diplomatic policy is a matter of great concern. (Allied dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>In the political program announced on the 17th, there was only an abstract indication of the need to reform the tax system. The specific method seems to be decided by the authorities of the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented starting from the twelfth year. However, according to the opinion of Finance Minister Baba and the statement he made when he took office, the new cabinet's fiscal policy is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Implement tax system consolidation uniformly in the central and local governments, and at the same time implement general tax increases to increase ordinary revenue. The tax increase method will be decided by the Cabinet Investigation Bureau and the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented starting from the twelfth year.</p>
<p>Adjust general and special accounting, and reform the special conferences of railways, communications, and monopolies to increase revenue from government-run enterprises.</p>
<p>In the future, the national defense expenditure will inevitably expand, so actively adopt a deficit public debt policy and do not adhere to the policy of gradually reducing public debt. (Allied dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The new Finance Minister Baba recently invited more than 20 leaders of Tokyo's banking circles to a luncheon at the Finance Minister's official residence. At the meeting, he gave a serious warning to these financial capitalists. He first described the domestic political situation from the February 26th Incident to the establishment of the Hirota Cabinet and then said that he hoped that the financial community would have a clear understanding of the above-mentioned political and social situation and would do its best to serve the country and the people with sincerity and without selfishness. If they do not change their attitude and continue to adopt a passive management method that is only concerned with selfish interests, they should be aware that unexpected disasters will befall them. Finally, he said, "If you disagree with the above-mentioned opinions, please take this opportunity to state them frankly. I will not adopt any opposing opinions when implementing new policies." The bankers all looked at each other blankly and did not say a word. (China Allied News dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Greek Statesman Venizelos Passes Away, Served as Prime Minister Eight Times, Distinguished Achievements, Still Thinking of His Country on His Deathbed <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Venizelos, the most famous Greek politician who served as Greek Prime Minister eight times, passed away here today from influenza at the age of 72. Yesterday, the doctor diagnosed his condition as critical, saying that he was old and difficult to save. Venizelos went into exile in Paris last March after participating in a failed revolution. Venizelos was born on the island of Crete in 1864 to a poor family. His parents wanted him to engage in business, but Venizelos had other ambitions. After graduating in Athens, he returned to his hometown and worked as a lawyer. At that time, the people of Crete were heavily guarded, and Venizelos encouraged them, which led to his election. In 1896, he participated in a failed revolution and went into exile with other leaders. Soon, he was revered as a national hero. When Crete gained autonomy, the ambassadors of Britain, France, and Russia appointed Prince George of Greece as a commissioner, and Venizelos was elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Venizelos was dissatisfied with this mediation and, with several loyal comrades, retreated to the mountains and raised the banner of righteousness again, making a second decision to resist, in 1905. The following year, George left the island, and in 1908, Crete was incorporated into Greek territory. Venizelos then took on an important task. In 1910, Venizelos first set foot on Greek soil and, eight days later, was appointed Prime Minister. At first, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece was forced to relinquish his position as Commander-in-Chief, but with Venizelos's help, he was able to regain his position. Venizelos then paid attention to consolidating domestic affairs, organizing the Balkan League, reorganizing the Greek army and navy, and implementing a prudent new foreign policy. In 1914, when the European War broke out, the Greek King wanted to help Germany, but Venizelos wanted to help the Allied countries. While hesitating to decide, King George of Greece was assassinated. The new monarch, Constantine, had been trained in the German army, held the rank of general, and his queen was the German Emperor's sister. He therefore dismissed Venizelos. In 1916, Venizelos went to Crete, launched the Salonika Revolution, and established a provisional government. The following year, the Greek King was deposed, and Greece joined the Allied countries in the war. When the peace was concluded, Venizelos gained great power. In 1920, Venizelos failed in the general election, and Constantine was restored to the throne. Venizelos went into seclusion for two years. Constantine was again deposed, and Venizelos took over as Prime Minister again. He then tried to reconcile the differences between the royalists and the republicans he led. In early 1924, Venizelos resigned from the regency due to difficult work and poor health. Two months later, George II was deposed, and Greece declared a republic. Venizelos retired for four years and returned to the political arena in 1928, fighting and winning against the government's financial policy. He then regained power and engaged in international affairs. In the same year, he signed the Italian-Greek Friendship Treaty, and the following year, he signed a similar treaty with Yugoslavia. Venizelos also settled disputes with Turkey and concluded several treaties, which made a great contribution to peace in the Near East. In 1931, Venizelos traveled to various European capitals to discuss the issue of Greek foreign debt. In January 1933, Venizelos was appointed Greek Prime Minister for the eighth time. He later lost power due to a military coup by Plastiras, who implemented a dictatorship. In June of the same year, Venizelos was ambushed while traveling by car four miles from Athens. The following May, another assassination attempt was discovered by the police. However, a few days later, a portrait of him that had been hanging in the Piraeus Parliament for 20 years was smeared with ink to vent anger. In 1935, another revolution broke out in Greece. Venizelos commanded the rebel army from his home on Crete. Later, his home was bombed by aircraft, and the revolution failed. Venizelos and his wife escaped to the island of Kasos by ship. On the same day, his name was removed from the Greek citizenship register. In April of the same year, Venizelos began to take refuge in France. Venizelos was gentle and dignified, looking like a cheerful professor and not at all like a revolutionary. Some said he was resourceful, and others said he could talk tirelessly with guests all day long. However, even his enemies recognized him as a passionate patriot. Venizelos was very self-disciplined, getting up early in the morning and only having a light meal before noon. In the morning, he only ate an apple and drank a cup of coffee. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: In his will before his death, former Greek Prime Minister Venizelos expressed two wishes: 1. He hoped that the people would unite under the rule of King George. 2. His body should be transported back to his hometown of Crete for burial. (National News dispatch, 18th)</p>

As a result, the drafting of the National Assembly Organization Law has been completed. The draft of the National Assembly Representative Election Law is still awaiting continued discussion at a meeting on the 19th. The drafting committee members carefully stipulated issues such as the allocation of the number of representatives of various types and the division of election districts. Since the central government has decided to allocate the number of representatives based on the number of people in the election districts and the number of people in the industry as an example, the examination and statistics of the existing number of people and industry groups must be carefully studied. However, the survey and statistics are complicated, and they cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, the committee members will separately stipulate the number of representatives of various types and the division of election districts in additional regulations. Currently, only the provisions of the National Assembly Representative Election Law are being drafted to meet the needs. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Hebei-Chahar Situation A Recent Overview:</p>
<p>Negotiations for the Abolition of the Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei; Japanese Sentiments Slightly Calmed by the Defeat of the Shanxi Bandits</p>
<p>From Beiping: The situation in Hebei-Chahar has been relatively stable on the surface recently, but the actual difficulties not only remain unresolved but are also progressing with time. On the diplomatic front, the authorities are genuinely making efforts to engage with the other side, but the results are still promising but not immediately attainable. Taking the "Eastern Hebei" issue as an example, Tada Hayao, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, has clearly stated to our authorities that he can order Yin Rugeng to end it voluntarily. However, the attached exchange conditions are still unacceptable, so the problem remains as if there is no solution. As for internal issues, the main concern is preventing communism. After the Shanxi bandits poured into and disturbed Shanxi, the information received in the past week was indeed full of rumors. However, after the army inflicted a heavy blow in the suppression, the facts have proven that the remaining bandits cannot stay in Shanxi for long. In other words, the military suppression of bandits in Shanxi will soon come to an end.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, Japanese newspapers often report on the suppression of bandits in Shanxi in a way that stirs up emotions. When Isoya Renkatsu, the Japanese military officer stationed in the north, met with Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, he expressed certain hopes. Song solemnly replied that the anti-communist arrangements in Hebei and Chahar provinces have already yielded excellent results and there is nothing to worry about. After this conversation, Isoya expressed his understanding. The way the Japanese feel can be clearly seen from the fragments of talk about Isoya's departure in subsequent Japanese newspapers. Future developments will inevitably increase compared to before. We are on the front line of national defense, and our thoughts cannot be fully expressed in just a few words. Now, let's further describe the core of the situation's inside story.</p>
<p>1. The "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization was originally cultivated by the Japanese. However, due to the recent change in the person in charge, and with the effective negotiations by our side during the transition, the Japanese expressed that they could have Yin, the rebel, handle the end of the organization. According to foreign reporters who went to Tongxian to investigate, before Doihara Kenji, who was stationed in Peiping, returned to Japan, there was indeed a rumor that the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization had ended and restored the original organization of the Ji Mi two-district commissioner's office. After Yin Rugeng flew to Tianjin and communicated with Tada Hayao, the commander of the Tianjin Japanese army, the above rumors became a thing of the past. Work in various places is intensifying. In terms of the current situation, the abolition of the puppet organization is quite different from reality, which is difficult to deny.</p>
<p>2. The Japanese's current attitude towards North China has not changed from their plan of the previous year. After the Shanxi bandits entered Shanxi, their emotions suddenly became excited. Japanese people on the Zhengtai Road are coming and going in an endless stream. Japanese planes are frequently shuttling between Zhangbing and Pingbing and transporting weapons. At the same time, Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Beiping are continuously making provocative reports. Fortunately, the authorities have made the utmost effort in preventing communism, giving the Japanese no excuse. Furthermore, the military suppression of bandits in Shanxi has achieved victory, so the emotions of the Japanese have indeed calmed down compared to the previous week. Recently, Shimizu, the counselor of the Japanese embassy, returned to Beiping after inspecting Bingzhou. He expressed to our country's reporter group that the bandit disaster in Shanxi is no longer a major problem, and praised the speed of the suppression. What deserves general attention recently is the issue of increasing the number of Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin and Beiping. According to Japanese sources, it may be implemented between summer and autumn of this year. Therefore, the efforts of the local authorities in Hebei-Chahar will truly be a long-term endeavor.

<p>New Anti-Bandit Arrangements by the Hebei Provincial Authorities:</p>
<p>Heavy Troops Deployed in Key Areas of Western Hebei; People's Militia in Various Counties Fully and Meticulously Equipped; Reorganizing Teams to Strengthen Local Military Forces</p>
<p>A dispatch from Baoding: After the communist bandits disturbed Shanxi, Yan Xishan, the Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, has ordered the various armies of Shanxi and Suiyuan to launch a large-scale suppression. The military situation has indeed greatly improved. However, since Shanxi and Hebei provinces are interdependent, Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Hebei provincial government, is paying close attention to the defense of Hebei Province. He has ordered Zhang Yunrong, the Director of the Hebei Provincial Security Department, to move from Baoding to Xingtai, convene a joint defense conference of various counties in western Hebei, and discuss the defense of western Hebei. Zhang is now directing operations from his base, and the people's militia in various counties have been fully and meticulously equipped. Zhang also relayed Song's orders to Wan Fulin and Feng Zhanhai, the various units stationed in Hebei province, to discuss deployment methods. The provincial government will allocate 160,000 yuan per month to encourage the various armies to vigorously defend the area, distributing 50,000 yuan per month to Wan Fulin's unit, 40,000 yuan per month to Feng Zhanhai's unit, and 70,000 yuan per month to Shang Zhen's unit. The defense of western Hebei will be jointly undertaken by the various armies, so local security is extremely secure.</p>
<p>The armed gatherings in various counties of southern Hebei have always launched disturbances after the emergence of green cornfields. Zhang Yunrong has strictly ordered the people's militia in various counties of southern Hebei to properly take precautions and has requested the assistance of Yu Qifeng's cavalry division stationed in Daming to provide nearby assistance in everything. In short, the military deployment for bandit defense in Hebei Province has now been fully prepared.</p>
<p>As for the defense corps in various counties, they have now also begun reorganization. All the old, weak, and disabled soldiers will be eliminated, and a sound and powerful force for defending the people will be reorganized. At the same time, the long-standing malpractice of local bullies manipulating them will be vigorously eradicated, making them a genuine tool for protecting the people and maintaining the local area. In addition to having the county magistrates handle this nearby and effectively, the provincial government has also dispatched inspectors and staff from the Security Department to various counties to supervise and carry out the work in order to achieve thorough implementation.</p>
<p>Zhang Yunrong also believes that in the past, whenever there were major bandit disasters in the province, the local people's militia, even when suppressing them, had to request assistance from the stationed army. The provincial government itself had no fundamental bandit suppression strength and still had to go through several consultations before it could mobilize, which was quite inconvenient. He has therefore recently obtained the consent of Chairman Song and the approval of the provincial council to have the Security Department organize two additional security regiments directly under the provincial government for deployment at any time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the baojia system previously implemented in this province was once suspended in the middle. Now, in order to save expenses, the provincial government has decided to have the various counties handle it directly and has ordered the various counties to begin implementation. All of these are important measures for stabilizing the local area and eliminating bandit disasters in this province. (17th)</p>
<p>Hebei Smuggling Prevention Measures:</p>
<p>Tianjin Customs and Beining Railway Sign Agreement; Strictly Prevent Transshipment Southward Starting on the 21st</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin: The issue of smuggling prevention in Hebei became a problem after the central government protested to Japan. The Tianjin Customs, following the orders of the Ministry of Finance, ordered the related railways to meticulously coordinate on a strategy to thoroughly block it. In the past week, the customs has sent personnel to jointly negotiate with the Tianjin Customs Supervision Office and the Beining Railway Bureau. At the same time, regarding diplomatic relations, in addition to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee's Foreign Affairs Committee being responsible for negotiating with the Japanese military in Tianjin and the Japanese Consul-General, hoping for their understanding, Xu Liya, the Commissioner of Customs of the Tianjin Customs, twice met with Kawagoe, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Tianjin, requesting assistance and a written document as a basis for occasional accidents in smuggling prevention. Kawagoe only verbally expressed that matters related to goods arriving at Chinese ports were not within the scope of consular jurisdiction. He could only advise expatriates with Jian and Yun to smuggle goods to restrain themselves slightly and would not interfere too much, causing backlash. Regarding the payment of written documents, it was not agreed to.</p>
<p>Since the authorities supervised very closely, the Tianjin Customs believed that the trend of smuggling in Hebei was like a river flowing downwards. The earlier it was blocked, the less the national tax would be lost. Although it is not possible to completely eradicate the root cause in one fell swoop, it is still better to pay attention to thorough methods and implement preventive measures than to sit idly by and watch it leak out. Therefore, before the Eastern Hebei issue is resolved, the smuggling prevention measures in that area will not be addressed for the time being. First, efforts will be made in Tianjin to investigate and ban the transshipment of smuggled goods southward under the cooperation of the railway and customs to prevent the various customs checkpoints on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line from being damaged. Based on this spirit, the Tianjin Customs repeatedly contacted the Beining Railway Bureau. The railway initially believed that the responsibility for smuggling prevention lay with the customs, not the railway bureau. If the railway bureau helped with smuggling prevention, it would easily lead to misunderstandings with foreign parties and create the suspicion of sharing responsibility with the customs, so there was considerable reluctance during the consultation. Later, Lin Shize, the Customs Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, interceded on its behalf and received an order from the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. The railway bureau then agreed to conclude an agreement with the customs within a possible scope, with each side mutually abiding by it as a basis for dealing with diplomatic issues. Last week, the agreement was negotiated in detail, but because the railway bureau used the wording "assist in smuggling prevention" between the lines, the customs was dissatisfied. It was originally planned to implement it on the 16th, but it had to be temporarily postponed. Lin Shize obtained a request from the Customs Tax Division and went to Peiping to discuss it with Chen Juesheng, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, urging Chen to order the bureau's staff not to dispute over words and delay national affairs. On the 16th, Du, the Deputy Tax Commissioner of the Customs, visited the person in charge of the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department again to discuss and confirm the matter in person. On the afternoon of that day, the railway bureau sent a letter to the customs with the proposed measures, requesting a written reply before they could be followed and implemented. After receiving the letter, the customs followed it on the 17th, issued a public notice on the 10th, stipulating that there would be a three-day period for various merchants to submit declarations for inspection, and that serious smuggling prevention would begin on the 21st. The announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Tianjin Customs Announcement No. 1125: Now that it has been agreed with the Beining Railway Bureau to implement the following interim measures from March 21st of this year, all foreign goods shipped via the railway should be declared to the customs for inspection before being transported into the station's freight yard or package room, and a "Customs Permit for Shipping Certificate" should be obtained from the station free of charge, filled out according to the format. If the inspection matches, the customs will sign and issue it to the shipper so that it can be submitted to the station for verification along with the shipping order. If there is no such certificate, or if there is one but it does not match, or if it is not signed by the customs, the railway station will refuse to transport it. As for the procedures for shipping goods, the customs has now stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The shipper should submit a declaration to the General Affairs Section of the Customs no later than one day before the shipment, along with the original import tax payment certificate and other supporting documents, to apply for inspection.</p>
<p>2. After receiving this declaration, the General Affairs Section of the Customs should verify that it matches the original import declaration and then send it to the customs officer on duty at the following inspection yards for inspection: (A) Customs Inspection Yard, (B) Customs Special Inspection Yard at the corner of Hebei Dajing Road and Xin Dalu Road (for railway-transported goods). The goods mentioned in the preceding paragraph may also be inspected in the shipper's own warehouse, but a special inspection fee must be paid in accordance with the regulations. If it is proven that it matches the declaration, the customs officer will sign the "Customs Permit for Shipping Certificate" and hand it over to the shipper to complete the shipping formalities. Urgently announce this to all merchants so that they may be fully informed. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>It was also heard that, according to reports received by the customs, there are currently 13 ships carrying smuggled goods, worth approximately four to five million yuan, at the Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe coastlines.

<p>Meningitis Found in Two Townships in Anhui Province:</p>
<p>More than a Dozen People Have Died from It</p>
<p>A dispatch from Wuhu: Wanzhi is the leading town of Xuancheng, and Sanxi is the leading town of Jingde. One is known for its production of rice and grain, and the other is a hub for bamboo, wood, charcoal, and firewood. Commerce is extremely prosperous in both towns, and their commercial interactions with Wuhu are particularly close, as the goods sold in both towns must be transported here for sale. According to those who have come here, meningitis has recently broken out in both towns. Fourteen people died in Sanxi in one day, causing widespread panic. The villagers see this as an unavoidable crisis and, instead of studying and providing medical relief, they regard it as the descent of a plague god, making vows and performing operas in the hope of ensuring peace. Such superstitious actions are truly ridiculous.</p>
<p>The patients in Wanzhi are all children aged four or five to fourteen or fifteen. When the illness first starts, there are headaches, vomiting, fever, and even convulsions. Acute cases die within ten hours at most, and five or six people have already died without being saved. Chronic cases have their heads bent backwards and cannot lean forward, as if constrained by tendons. People are also very panicked and are planning ways to provide relief. The local hospital has sent people to Wuhu to purchase serums for emergency needs. According to the inland villages and towns, medical equipment is extremely simple, and the general public also lacks hygiene knowledge. Whenever an infectious disease occurs, they are always at a loss. Therefore, it is really necessary to actively promote public health in the villages and towns in the future. (17th)</p>

<p>Major Post Office Theft Case: Another Accomplice Apprehended.</p>
<p>Received 12,000 Yuan in Stolen Money.</p>
<p>Previously Released Under Amnesty for Theft.</p>
<p>The North Sichuan Road Postal Administration experienced a major robbery and bloodshed on September 9th of last year. The police apprehended the perpetrator, Ji Rentang (also known as Wukong Monk), a man from Jiangbei, and a group of men and women. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where Ji was sentenced to life imprisonment and the others were punished accordingly. During interrogation, the name of an accomplice, Wang Shulou from Funing, who had fled, was revealed. The court issued an arrest warrant, but no trace could be found. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Yubin, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that Wang was hiding at No. 7 Zhifu Road. He coordinated with a Western detective and secretly went to the location, arresting him at the address. Wang (also known as Shupei and Chen Yuren, 33 years old) was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Concession stated that the defendant admitted at the police station that he received 12,000 yuan in stolen money from the case but had spent it all. He was not present during the robbery. He was previously convicted of theft in 1932 and sentenced to three years and six months, but released under amnesty the year before last. The case should be adjourned for further investigation. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Wang Fusheng gave him the money after the post office robbery, but it was later taken by his concubine. He denied knowing Ji Rentang and others, and his answers were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Qingpu County: Hostage Rescued in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Perpetrators Transferred to Jiangsu Water Police.</p>
<p>Ahu Gen, the five-year-old grandson of Zhang Guixing, a wealthy resident of Qiantao Jiagang Village in Qingpu County, was kidnapped by bandits on December 19th of last year at midnight. The bandits also shot and killed Gu Shaolin, a member of the local militia. A large ransom was demanded. Detectives from the First District, Second Team of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, together with detectives from the Laozha Police Station, arrested the perpetrators Zhu Ziliang, Wu Ajin, Wei Shixiong, and Chen Fengbao (mother and son) in Shanghai. They also rescued two other child hostages, Li Zhusheng and Li Rongsheng, from another case. However, Ahu Gen was not found. With the approval of the First Special District Court, the perpetrators were transferred for trial. The Water Police had discovered where Ahu Gen was being held. Detective Jiang Deyu went to the Chengdu Road Police Station at 9:20 AM the day before yesterday to request assistance. Chief Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Zhou Yushan, and Detectives Zhang Peilan and Liu Wenzhao went to No. 11 Furen Lane, Chengdu Road, and arrested Zhu Ziliang's concubine, Zhu Yu (also known as Xiaomei).

<p>Robbers Open Fire Through Door, Victim Dies Tragically.</p>
<p>Yang Xien, a 32-year-old resident of Baoshan, worked as a staff member at the Shanghai Medical College library on Haige Road. He lived near his workplace, at No. 24 Zhujia Ku. He had a regular routine of leaving early and returning late. At about 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yang Xien returned home from work. Around 7:00 PM in the evening, four robbers suddenly arrived at Yang's house to rob him. Under the pretext of asking for information, Yang opened the door to look outside. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers immediately rushed inside. Yang Xien, seeing their suspicious appearance, knew they were not good people and quickly pushed the robber out the door and closed the door. In the nick of time, the robbers, angered by Yang's cunning, immediately fired through the door. The bullet pierced the door and struck Yang in the abdomen. He collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely conscious. The robbers, realizing they had caused trouble, fled in all directions. Yang's family rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Doctors found that the bullet had not passed through his body and attempted to remove it surgically. However, due to the severity of the injury and excessive blood loss, they were unable to save him. He died in the hospital at 10:00 PM that night. Yesterday morning, Zhang Qingxiang, the local bailiff of the 12th district, reported the incident to the Procuratorate of the Local Court, requesting an autopsy. Subsequently, Zhang Ruilin, the deceased's nephew, also petitioned the court to waive the autopsy, stating that the body had already been transported to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xie Xu Road for burial and requested that the autopsy be waived. The court ordered that the decision be awaited.</p>
<p>Ancient Yue Kingdom Site Discovered Near Zhapu.</p>
<p>Mostly Ancient Pottery Shards with Unique Patterns.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Has Written to Zhejiang Provincial Government for Protection.</p>

<p>New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Requests Trademark Bureau to Postpone Move to Beijing.</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "We recently received a joint letter from member associations such as the Zhongxi Pharmacy and Zhongfa Pharmacy stating that the Trademark Bureau previously moved its offices from Beijing to Shanghai in the Republic of China year 20 because 80% of the businesses applying for trademark registration were located in Shanghai, and the remaining 20% were scattered in Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places, to facilitate nearby inquiries from these businesses. Over the years, businesses in various places have deeply understood the importance of trademark registration and benefited from the convenience of nearby contact. Therefore, the number of registration requests has increased daily. We have now heard that the Bureau may move from Shanghai to Beijing. If this happens, businesses in Shanghai will feel greatly inconvenienced. We hereby request your Association to quickly ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Executive Yuan to prevent the Trademark Bureau from moving to Beijing temporarily to benefit business." The Association states that Shanghai is a hub of industry and commerce, and the number of businesses applying for trademark registration is indeed 80% of the total, as stated by the pharmacies. Since the Bureau moved from Beijing to Shanghai, factories have found it much more convenient to make inquiries nearby regarding trademark registration matters than having to correspond through official documents. In recent years, there has been a more enthusiastic response to trademark registration than before, which may be attributed to this. We hereby urgently telegram your Ministry to consider the difficulties of businesses and quickly order the Bureau to postpone the move to Beijing. We await your command.</p>

<p>Huang Yanpei Travels to Sichuan for Lectures and Sightseeing.</p>
<p>Since his serious illness last autumn, Mr. Huang Yanpei has been traveling in Sichuan and has not yet returned. According to sources from the China Vocational Education Society, although Mr. Huang's health has recovered since leaving the hospital, he still needs to rest his mind. His eldest son is a professor at Chengdu University in Sichuan and insisted on having him come for recuperation. Fortunately, his old friend Lu Zuofu came to Shanghai and sincerely invited him to tour Western Sichuan. He traveled with his wife two months ago and is now lecturing at Chengdu University Middle School and other places. He will return to Shanghai no later than early next month. Rumors that Mr. Huang has ties to the Shanghai Cultural Circle National Salvation Association are unfounded. Since his illness, Mr. Huang has not attended any meetings. Although the association elected Mr. Huang and Jiang Wenyu and Yang Weiyu, directors of the China Vocational Education Society, as directors, they all declined the positions due to their busy schedules and therefore have no connection with the Vocational Education Society. Mr. Huang is unaware of this matter.</p>

<p>Tai Chi Master Yang Chengfu Passes Away.</p>
<p>Tai Chi master Yang Chengfu was hired by the commander-in-chief of the First Group Army in Guangzhou, the Fourth Group Army in Guangxi, and the Public Security Bureau to teach boxing in Guangdong two years ago. Due to acclimatization, he contracted a water-borne illness. Treatment by both Chinese and Western doctors was ineffective. After returning to Shanghai, he passed away yesterday due to the severity of his illness and lack of effective treatment. The loss of this master is a misfortune for the national martial arts community, and all who heard the news deeply lamented it.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Association Replies to Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Silk Industry Association replied to Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop yesterday, stating: "We have received your letter of the 17th. We have noted that in order to address the increasingly fierce competition among businesses, which has led to frequent disputes and damaged business ethics, this association, together with the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association and representatives of other companies and shops, drafted three guidelines in October 1934. Your shop and others approved them by affixing seals on a household basis, promising to abide by them and submitting them to the Social Bureau for record-keeping. This association then notified the shops in the market to comply with them. However, over time, these guidelines have been disregarded. Initially, they were outwardly complied with but inwardly resisted, and more recently, the situation has worsened. Not only are the public agreements of the industry regarded as mere formalities, but the declining trend has also eroded business ethics. This association is concerned and has requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to find ways to prevent this. Reading your shop's letter and today's Shen Bao advertisement, the public agreements signed by hand have been completely violated. What is silk spinning? How can there be a reason to sell it in units of one tenth of a centimeter? If your shop does not admit to violating the public agreements, then you must be deceiving customers by selling inferior goods. May we ask what is the purpose of setting up a shop for business? If the sacrifice is truly genuine, then the huge advertising costs will not be compensated, and the daily expenses will not be covered. If you want to use the good name of sacrifice to attract more customers, losing here and compensating there, hoping to make a small profit and gamble for profit, this technique, although considered by those who practice it to be innovative, is considered by this association to be an improper method of attracting customers, violating business ethics. Moreover, in the past, when customers did not understand the effect of using inferior means to attract customers by using one or two special items, they were easily misled. However, now the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and local governments are striving to strictly crack down on this type of behavior, and the general customer psychology is only to seek genuine goods at reasonable prices. For excessive publicity that exceeds human nature and common sense, everyone can understand it. Therefore, not only can it not deceive the masses, but the poor skills of the donkey of Guizhou only expose its shortcomings. This association's mission is to correct the business malpractices of the industry and to seek the common welfare of the industry. Therefore, it will always maintain the public agreements of the industry. Regarding the points stated in your shop's letter, we believe that they are in clear violation of the various agreements. In particular, your shop's actions are fruitless and only lead to ridicule from customers. We are hereby issuing a final warning, hoping that you will voluntarily correct these malpractices. The request to send personnel and forward statements will not be considered. This is an urgent letter in reply. We hope you will take note. This is addressed to Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop."</p>
<p>YWCA to Open Women's Bathhouse and Tea Room.</p>
<p>Since moving to No. 9 Jing'an Temple Road, the Shanghai YWCA has been striving to adapt its various services to the needs of society and to promote them. Recognizing that women in Shanghai, due to family conditions, rarely pay attention to bathing, the association has now opened a bathhouse to promote women's bathing. It is open to women from all walks of life from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily. To prevent the spread of infectious diseases and skin diseases, users must bring their own towels and other supplies. It is scheduled to open next Monday. Furthermore, the association's location is quiet and secluded, making it an ideal place for ladies to enjoy tea, entertain guests, and relax. The association opened a tea and snack room the day before yesterday, open from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily, welcoming people from all walks of life to come and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Municipal Public Safety Bureau Arrests Suspects in Counterfeit Lottery Ticket Case.</p>
<p>Ji Yuanpu, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau's Detective Brigade, received a tip that Zhou Mingsheng and others at No. 33 Qiuan Lane, Chang'an Road, were counterfeiting lottery tickets. He dispatched Xue Shilin and Zhou Deming, together with the Hengfeng Road Police Station, led by Patrol Officer Hu Yiqian and police officers Chen Mingsheng and Song Zhenya, to No. 33 Qiuan Lane, Chang'an Road, and arrested Zhou Mingsheng. Zhou confessed that an accomplice, Shi Xingrong, was hiding in the French Concession. They immediately took the suspect and the original investigators to the French Police Station. The French detective, Delan, and Chinese detective, Zhou Zhirong, went to No. 94 Lihua Road to arrest him. However, the suspect was not there, but many items related to the counterfeiting were seized. Subsequently, Zhou Mingsheng confessed that Shi Xingrong and his concubine were hiding at No. 707 Minguo Road. They immediately went to the address and, together with police officer Liu Qingrui from the Lao Beimen Police Station, arrested Shi Xingrong and his concubine, Shi Jiang, at No. 707 Minguo Road. Zhou Mingsheng further confessed that the mastermind, Li Yousheng, was at the Dasheng Printing House at No. 173 Caishi Road in the French Concession. They immediately went to the address and, together with the French police, arrested the mastermind, Li Yousheng, and seized many counterfeit lottery tickets. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation and handed over for legal processing.</p>

<p>Popular Lectures Launching Speech Published by the Popular Readings Editorial Department In recent years, due to the urgent needs of the country, general attention has shifted to various affairs that seek quick results; few people pay attention to relatively slow and long-term undertakings. More than a decade ago, everyone competed to advocate "Education to Save the Nation." If anyone were to start such a movement now, they would surely be laughed at for not understanding the urgency and for being impractical. We do not deny that extraordinary measures should be taken in extraordinary times, but continuous, long-term work that plans for the country's centuries-long future should by no means be abandoned. Moreover, to "treat a three-year illness," one must "seek seven-year-old moxa." Today, China's accumulated weakness is not just three years old, so the fundamental plan certainly cannot be effective with quick gains and immediate benefits. We believe that there is an extremely important aspect in China at the moment, which people with lofty ideals have repeatedly resolved to cry out loudly, but has not yet been completed: "arousing the masses." Everyone knows that the material life of the Chinese masses is the most difficult in the world. But is it not the same in their spiritual life? Moreover, the difficulty of material life is due to insufficient knowledge and skills; ignorance is the greatest cause of poverty and weakness. The purpose of "arousing the masses" is not only to make them aware of the poverty of their lives and that they should strive to learn skills to improve it, but also to make them understand the current crisis of the country and their responsibility to the country, and how they should open up a dangerous environment for themselves and for the country and strive hard. Moreover, in this era of rapid changes in the world, they should know the basic common sense that a modern citizen must have. But if we examine the current state of knowledge of the general public, we will be very alarmed. They have been bound by thousands of years of inherited traditional ideas, as well as all kinds of gods and monsters, and the shackles of ritual teachings, cultivating ignorance, exaggeration, dependence, blind obedience, selfishness, belief in fate, lack of unity, and apathy towards politics, making them most unsuitable to be citizens of a modern-style country. When we think of the various possible crises the country faces under serious aggression and threats, we cannot help but feel chills for them. However, the formation of these accumulated habits is not due to the orthodox canon of sages and worthies. Instead, it is the popular readings despised by the literati, such as ballad books, drum lyrics, narrative songs, and storytelling novels, that are their only form of entertainment and the only food for their minds. These books dominate their lifelong habits, thoughts, and behaviors, even their funerals after death. The New Culture Movement, which advocated innovative thinking, is forever stagnating in the upper class society that has received secondary education or above, and has not reached the lower masses. Moreover, even young people who have received secondary education cannot resist the inertia of the old forces "pulling them back" as soon as they leave school, and still surrender to their original bad habits. The general public's lack of good and healthy reading material is really the fault of those engaged in cultural undertakings. We founded this publication to try our best to make a small contribution in this area. We want to use popular and clear national language or dialects to write stories or songs about the good words and deeds, great achievements and feats of our ancestors in history, as well as modern world knowledge and scientific ideas, to gradually replace the popular readings among the people and eliminate the superstitious, absurd, and obscene parts of the old readings. We believe that only when the majority of the masses can achieve "health," "responsibility," "scientification," and "selflessness" in their thoughts and behaviors can there be hope for national construction and national rejuvenation. However, this work of "arousing the masses" is difficult and huge. We are aware of our weak abilities, and to expect to achieve this distant goal with this weak voice is like "using a pig's lungs to pray for a full cart," which will inevitably be laughed at by the wise. But we firmly believe that this is the undeniable responsibility of scholars today, and we cannot afford to worry about our limited abilities and repeat the mistakes of inaction. We hope that those who are interested in this will join in cooperation, and those with experience will provide criticism and guidance. It is not that we do not know that the road is far and the task is heavy, but we can only move forward. Thomas Edison Zheng Kanzi Everyone knows that the greatest inventor of modern times is Edison. He has more than a thousand inventions, among which the electric light, movies, and phonograph are the most famous. Those who have never seen Edison, hearing about his great inventions, may doubt that he is an extraordinary person. In fact, he is just an ordinary person, but he is more diligent than ordinary people. Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in a remote village in Milan, America. His father was a farmer, and his family was not very wealthy. When Edison was young, he moved with his parents to Michigan, where he attended elementary school. Edison, as a child, had a strange temperament. He did not like to study, but only liked to take things apart and touch them. He wanted to see the bottom of everything, asking about everything until he got to the bottom of it. Except for his mother, no one liked him, thinking he was stupid and silly, and definitely could not achieve anything. Everyone also said that his mother was biased, "Every mother thinks her leprous-headed son is good!" When he entered school, he could not learn anything; every exam, his grades were always at the bottom; the teachers who taught him were discouraged, unanimously saying that he was a moron and decided to have him expelled. His mother was very upset when she heard the news, but she was not disappointed, because she knew that unless there was something wrong with the body, there would never be a child who could not be educated. She believed that this was entirely the fault of the teachers who did not understand the child's personality and taught haphazardly, and it could not be that her son was mentally deficient. One day, Edison's mother was worried about her son, hiding in an empty room, secretly planning a remedy, when Edison also rushed in in a panic, his face red and white, looking very awkward. It turned out that he had just returned from school, and everyone at home was surrounding him and shaming him. He only heard a chorus of scolding: "silly child," "good-for-nothing," "stupid thing," and he could not tell who was scolding him. He did not dare to look up, thinking that his mother was also among these people, scolding him together, and he felt even more sad, feeling like he had nowhere to go. Full of grievances, he rushed into the room, not wanting to bump into his mother alone there. He hurriedly hugged his mother and called out "Mom," and then burst into tears. His mother knew that he had been wronged again, and while wiping away her son's tears, she comforted him, saying: "Good child, don't be sad, you have Mom. If the teacher doesn't teach you, Mom will teach you. If you are determined to study hard, you can improve. What are you afraid of?" From then on, Edison did not go to school, but studied with his mother at home. Because his mother understood his temperament, she "patiently guided" him according to his interests, and he progressed very quickly. At the age of ten, he was able to read famous works such as English History, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and the Encyclopedia Britannica. He read widely and was able to be precise, but he did not only read books, but was also very good at doing experiments. He was patient in finding ways to test things and would not give up until he found out the truth. For example, when he was six years old, because he wanted to see how the chicks hatched, he sat beside the goose cage all day, unwilling to go back for lunch, which made his father angry. It can be seen that his poor performance in school was not because he was less intelligent than others, but because the lessons at that time were too boring, and he had other things to love and was absent-minded. Edison's father saw that his son liked to do experiments, so he let him set up a laboratory in his mother's room. His father's intention was to use this method to restrain him, so that he would not run around mischievously, but unexpectedly this became the starting point for his great inventions. When he had this laboratory, he was so happy that he jumped up and down. He saved the money his mother gave him to buy candy and tried to buy or make various necessary experimental instruments and chemicals. His room was so fun: it was full of broken cans and old bottles. Sometimes he closed the windows during the day, lit candles, and burned this and soaked that, burying himself in the laboratory all day long. Even when his friends invited him out to play, he had no interest. Unfortunately, his family was very poor and could not let him always stay at home to read and experiment. When he was twelve years old, he could not bear the hunger and cold, so he had to work as a newspaper boy on the train. Because he had been poor since he was a child, he felt that he could not be sloppy in life, and he put his energy into everything he did. Before dawn, he ran onto the train to sell newspapers, and he was still reading his beloved books late at night. He was willing to endure hardship, and he was sensible and good at talking. He got along well with the general passengers and the staff on the train, and everyone liked this child. Therefore, his newspaper sales were very large, and he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the luggage compartment of the train. Two years later, America happened to be at war between the North and the South over the "slavery issue." Edison knew that everyone was eager to know the news of the war, so he set up a quick report in the luggage compartment, specializing in war news. He was the general manager, editor, typesetter, proofreader, and news vendor. Because he was serious about his work, the quick report sold very well. Even so, he only regarded running the newspaper as a sideline, and most of the time he spent in the laboratory. Unexpectedly, while he was buried in hard work, seeking further study, he inadvertently caused a great disaster; the phosphorus bottle in the laboratory was overturned and suddenly broke due to the bumps of the train, and it immediately caught fire. In a moment, the entire luggage car was burned to ashes! The conductor found out the cause of the fire and was so angry that his eyes turned white. He slapped Edison on the head, causing sparks to explode in his head. From then on, he had one ear that he could not hear clearly for the rest of his life. Edison had nowhere to go, so he had to return to his hometown. Relatives saw him so down and out, and said that he was useless, and turned a blind eye to him. Only his mother understood him and gently comforted him, and opened up another laboratory for him at home. Because Edison had run a quick report, he knew that telegraphs were convenient and accountable and would definitely develop in the future, so he had long been determined to study telegraphy; but it was difficult to obtain instruments at home, and he could not start. It just so happened that once he took a risk and saved the son of a train station chief from escaping death, and the station chief was grateful to him and wanted to reward him heavily. He did not want property, but only wanted to learn in the telegraph room of the station. The station chief of course agreed, and he was so happy that he danced with joy. He knew that the opportunity was rare, so he worked hard day and night, and in less than four months, he learned all the knowledge about telegraphs. When he was fifteen years old, because of his excellent grades, he had been formally appointed as a technician at the station. Later, he worked in various telegraph companies, working and researching at the same time. By the time he moved to Boston, he had already invented the desk telegraph. He borrowed a lot of money to manufacture telegraphs, but unfortunately he failed, fell from the debt platform, and had to flee to New York. Without a penny and without a friend, Edison lived in New York for three days, in poverty and distress, beyond words. On the fourth day, he learned from the newspaper classifieds that a stock company was recruiting telegraph technicians, and he hurried to apply. On the second day of his employment, the telegraph suddenly broke down at the time when the company's trading was at its peak. The company's losses were in the millions. The general manager was anxious and helpless, jumping up and down, and hurriedly asked the newly arrived Edison for advice. Edison only spent eight minutes to repair the telegraph, so that the company did not suffer any loss. The company thought he had made great contributions, so he promoted him to manager. Only then did Edison have the money and time to study with peace of mind. The first step he completed was his desk telegraph, and he partnered with friends to open a Wave Love Trading Company, manufacturing and selling telegraphs. At the same time, his new machines obtained special sales licenses in several places, and he also transferred the patent rights of a certain part of the telegraph, earning 40,000 gold, with strong capital, and the business went more smoothly. Following that, he invented the automatic telegraph, phonograph, and electric light, of which the electric light cost him the most effort. Edison had long wanted to invent the incandescent light bulb (which is now the electric light we commonly use), but it was not until 1878 that he decided to engage in research. The carbon wire used in the bulb was selected after two years of work, selecting more than six thousand kinds of materials and undergoing more than six thousand kinds of experiments. But this was only part of the success, and he could not manufacture the entire electric light, because the carbon wire in the glass bulb would self-ignite when it was incandescent, and the glass bulb would also melt. Later, after much painstaking research, he learned that using a vacuum glass bulb could avoid this problem, and the incandescent electric light was considered complete. In September 1882, Edison founded the first electric light office on Pearl Street in New York. At that time, many people still superstitiously believed that "electricity is lightning" and were afraid that installing electric lights would endanger their lives, so the electric wires were installed during the day, but were cut off at night. After much explanation, the citizens gradually gained trust. The initial users were only two hundred families, but it quickly spread throughout the world. Edison later continued to research and invent, and obtained more than a thousand kinds of patent rights, none of which were not for the benefit of mankind. He worked all day and night, eating and sleeping in the laboratory, until his beard was snowy white, and he was still like this. He had to work sixteen or seventeen hours a day without rest. In his old age, he often said to people: "Although I only lived to eighty years old, my work is worth more than two hundred years." Some people say that half of America's wealth was earned by him. He died in 1931, but his career and his contributions to mankind and the country will forever make him immortal. The Task of Publishing Periodicals in Times of National Crisis Du Xiu In the 46th issue of this journal, we read the article "Publishing Guidelines in Times of National Crisis." In this article, the author pointed out that there are three major principles for publishing guidelines in times of national crisis: first, it should be for extraordinary times, not for ordinary times; second, it should be unified, not diversified; and third, it should be for the masses, not for the aristocracy. The author believes that these three principles are all without question and should be strived to be realized. Now the development of this issue seems to have reached the point of not discussing principles, but providing concrete plans. The author of the article said that he would discuss it in a separate article, so I will not discuss this point for the time being, and now I will elaborate on one point that I have thought of. Everyone feels that the most important work during the national crisis is the work of educating the masses, that is, the so-called training work. This work of educating the masses can indeed "increase the power of the entire nation to survive, and can also erode the power of the entire nation to survive." The key lies in whether this work is promoted and whether the method of promoting this work is correct. What we are going to discuss now is the issue of promotion methods. In my humble opinion, the supply of materials for educating the masses during this national crisis, in addition to various publications published by various bookstores that meet the needs of extraordinary times, periodic publications should bear a very important responsibility. Why? First, periodic publications are nothing more than monthly publications, semi-monthly publications, weekly publications, and three-day publications. In terms of time, they do not provide intermittent and sporadic materials like daily newspapers, nor are they as easy to lose timeliness as a 200,000-word overview of international politics. Because they are published once a month or once a week, the comments on domestic and foreign current events can be systematic and can grasp timeliness. After reading them once a month or every week, readers can observe the development of current events and international trends in the next month or next week based on this point of view. After a month or a week has passed, readers can make a judgment based on their own observations, and can also compare and study the opinions in the weekly or monthly publications published in the next week or month with their own observations. Assuming that the content of this weekly or monthly publication can indeed bear the mission of educating the masses without shame, then the content of this publication can become material for training the masses and achieve great results. With the rapid changes in the current international situation, the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, and the political distress of the people reaching a focus, "how can we obtain a way out for the nation?" "How should we contribute our abilities?" "How should we train ourselves?" All these questions are urgently waiting to be resolved by the masses, then the most time-sensitive periodic publications can adapt to this urgent need. Second, the books supplied by the publishing industry each have their own professional nature. Those that talk about international affairs will certainly not talk about the principles of economics, and those that talk about the principles of economics will not talk about the political situation in the Far East. In the specialized study of a certain issue, this type of book is afraid that it is not rich enough, but in the supply of training materials for educating the masses, it is hoped that every citizen can buy a publication about extraordinary times, which is not possible for the economic power of the general public, nor is it permitted by the time of readers who are busy with food and clothing. However, in periodic publications, there is absolutely no problem. The current general periodic publications are often a "stir-fry of ten scenes," with "current affairs reviews," "international speeches," "academic treatises," "book and newspaper introductions," "life records," "military common sense," and "literary poetry." Then, as long as the editors of periodic publications can grasp the needs of the times and the demands of the people, it is not difficult to take the supply of training materials for extraordinary times as the object of the entire content of the publication, and it is even easier to live up to this task in name and in fact. Readers only need to purchase one copy per month or per week, and this publication can supply all the things they need. They do not need to purchase a large number of books, which will cause difficulties in terms of time and financial resources. Third, the price of each book, the cheapest only costs two corners, and the expensive ones cost four or five yuan, and the average number is about five corners. With the weak purchasing power of the general public, it is impossible to expect them to buy more publications for extraordinary times. But periodic publications are different. Whether it is a monthly publication, a semi-monthly publication, or a weekly publication, the annual subscription price is at most two yuan—except for foreign countries—and the number of words supplied each month is about 100,000 words, and some even reach 150,000 words. The difference between the price paid and the rights obtained is shocking compared with general publications. Therefore, from an economic point of view, periodic publications are the most suitable publications for extraordinary times. Since periodic publications are suitable for taking on the responsibility of educating the masses in extraordinary times, as mentioned above, now we may as well further discuss what kind of materials periodic publications should supply in extraordinary times. Now I will try to formulate it and ask readers to correct it. First, the exposition of revolutionary philosophy and revolutionary theory; Second, the discussion of methods of organizing the masses and training the masses; Third, systematic reviews of domestic and foreign current events; Fourth, the explanation of the principles and applications of social sciences and natural sciences; Fifth, the inculcation of military common sense. Assuming that a periodic publication takes the above five major categories as its goal and supplies all the essential knowledge in these five major categories, then at least it can be relatively close to the publication in our ideal. Although periodic publications can take on this extraordinary work of educating the masses, it is only a part, not the whole, because the materials supplied by periodic publications are often general and brief; if we want to give the general public more profound and detailed training materials, then periodic publications cannot bear it, and it depends on the special books published by various bookstores. Bookstore Scenes (Continued) Li Hengzhi Advertising Techniques In the previous issues of this journal, someone raised the issue of book and newspaper reviews, hoping for serious book and newspaper reviews to guide readers in selecting new books. In fact, today, with a few exceptions, the so-called book and newspaper reviews are just one of the advertising techniques of bookstores. So let's talk about the advertising techniques of bookstores. Every bookstore has an advertising department, and employs specialists to design. The bookstore advertisements we all know are: first, advertising in newspapers; second, sending out catalogs and single-page advertisements; third, publishing magazines (most of the function of magazines is in advertising). But these are only public. Bookstores have many more advertising techniques! Some may not seem like advertisements, but in fact they are still publicity. Some are just not public. Briefly speaking, there are at least the following types: First, selling pre-orders—some are not for collecting cash, but to make readers know that this book is so important, the content is naturally reliable, and it is so cheap, so don't miss the opportunity. Second, inscription or introduction by celebrities—this was very common in the past. When publishing a book, ask a so-called celebrity or scholar to write a few words, and you can post a large advertisement, such as what Mr. So-and-so's comment is, how Professor So-and-so is, etc. The Commercial Press's "Weekly Standard Book" can also be regarded as another form of application of this method. Third, preferential treatment methods—there are many preferential treatment methods, the most ingenious is the trick played by Life and Kaiming last year. Kaiming gave preferential treatment to subscribers of Life magazines, and Life gave preferential treatment to subscribers of Kaiming and middle school students. The purpose was nothing more than to advertise their own books and attract business. As a result, they even quarreled in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Shen Bao's Local Supplement Discusses the Promotion of Native Goods Movement Jianping Mr. Tai Shuangqiu and others, who once launched the "Nian Er Movement," have shouted out the slogan "Promote Native Goods." They also borrowed the Municipal Public Education Center of the Temple of Literature to hold a grand opening ceremony and stipulated that this year is the "First Year of Native Goods." The main purpose is to save the weakening rural economy, which is naturally beyond reproach. Even the four major outlines in their stipulated implementation plan are very appropriate methods. The first is to investigate famous local products in various places and improve local products; to investigate the production and sales situation and the social and economic situation. And the third is to hold lectures, movement weeks, compile and publish publications, and hold exhibitions and other publicity work. These are all very basic and thorough work. As for the second point, promoting superior varieties of crops, improving handicraft weaving, improving animal husbandry, and promoting agricultural product manufacturing, we can also see their emphasis on the improvement of native goods. The fourth point is about the promotion of the entire movement, such as introducing excellent native goods, promoting production and sales cooperatives, holding small-scale loans, and encouraging the use of native goods, which are also urgent and effective ways. However, we still seem to have some doubts about this native goods promotion movement: this movement seems to be missing something. The missing thing, to put it bluntly, is "basic understanding." The national goods promotion movement has been launched countless times in our country, but the unexpected failures of the "Women's National Goods Year" and "Students' National Goods Year" and the like have chilled us. Aren't native goods and national goods two sides of the same road? However, the focus of native goods is smaller than that of national goods, focusing on agricultural products in rural areas. In fact, the difficulties of both are determined by our country, which is now a colony. In theory, we cannot deny that this "native goods movement" is a very effective method, but in reality, this theory is still hindered by the current reality. The remedy for the rural economy is to wait for the revival of the entire national economy. In rural areas with constant natural and man-made disasters, farmers are already too busy fleeing famine, so where can they find a way to rectify things? The current rural areas are no longer the natural children who can bury their heads and transform behind closed doors. Even if the transformation movement is successful, and native goods have become the best products as desired, can they compete with foreign goods? Will they be defeated by foreign goods' dumping policies? When the general purchasing power has not yet stabilized, how can poor people not be greedy for cheapness? At the same time, the country is in a crisis of being piecemealed by imperialism, and national rights are completely unprotected. Can native goods be promoted smoothly? On the same day as the closing ceremony, the evening newspaper reported: Japanese people set up hemp spinning factories in Korea and are planning to manufacture on a large scale. Our summer cloth will be eliminated by Japanese goods due to heavy tariffs. News like this is aimed at our national goods movement or native goods movement. Haven't our enthusiastic national goods or native goods movement gentlemen seen it? In China, which is being subjected to imperialist dismemberment, any revival movement will be greatly hindered. This is not to oppose the native goods movement, but to present a "memorandum" to the gentlemen who are enthusiastically advocating it. —— To effectively make all movements proceed without hindrance, the prerequisite is to seek national liberation, sovereign independence, and the rise of people who are oppressed and unable to breathe! Sparrow Er He Sparrows were originally unfamiliar to me (of course, people who live in the city all year round can know everything about sparrows?). Since I came here last year, I seem to have recognized and known it like a new friend. When I put down the test papers, threw away the pen, and sat quietly in the shady room smoking a cigarette, the chirping of the sparrow not only did not break the loneliness around me, but made the loneliness around me deeper. I also feel the poetic realm of Wang Wei's "the bird cries, the forest is more quiet" in the same way. My house was originally secluded on one side, although it faces east, the Confucian Temple stands towering in the southeast corner of the house, and the winter sun is very far south, so I can't see the sun in the morning at all, only a large, terrible shadow of the Confucian Temple lies in front of the house. But the sparrows seem to particularly like this place. They chirp and chatter all day long among the rafters. With a "whoosh," they fly down, and with another "whoosh," they fly up again. This sound of flapping wings, which brews loneliness, often makes me unbearable to the point of wanting to shed my lonely tears. Sometimes they are simply so presumptuous as if I don't exist. One or two of them fly into my house, looking at me with very nimble eyes, but after only a brief moment, they turn their heads back and look at other things with a disdainful gaze. Of course, in their eyes, I am just a useless still life. Many times, I was so angry that, after they came to my house, I immediately closed the door nimbly and shouted loudly in a frenzy. This time they knew I existed. They were so frightened that they crashed into the glass window, even bleeding from their mouths. Finally, some escaped from the gaps, and some squatted down and stopped shaking. I was like a victorious warrior, with a smile on my lips. I was proud, and I shouted softly with an arrogant attitude: "This is how you know how powerful I am, you poor little things!" So they no longer came into my house. They stood among the rafters, chirping as if warning each other, and as if they understood each other, as soon as they saw me, they glanced in surprise and flew to a farther place. However, I felt lonely, as if a victorious warrior had killed all the enemies. I regretted it, and I repented with all my heart. When I came again this spring, I still lived in that bedroom, but the sparrows seemed not to forget the old enemy and still dared not fly into my house. This made me sad, as if I had lost something, and what I felt was boundless sadness. Every morning when I woke up, listening to the chirping of the sparrows, I always thought of the injured sparrow that time, and the blood that flowed from its mouth... So during the day, I was afraid to stand in the bedroom. Whether I was correcting test papers or sitting blankly, I had to go to the office. My feelings for this group of sparrows had been damaged to the point where they could not be recovered. But I found sparrows elsewhere. Last year, I ate in the second dining hall, but this year I ate in the first dining hall. The first dining hall is a tall and ancient house. Perhaps it was because of the cold spring weather, many sparrows always liked to stand on the main beam in the dining hall. They chirped and chattered as if no one else was there, exactly the same as the sparrows in front of my bedroom. They made noise especially loudly before and after we ate. As long as one table of people in the twenty-odd tables was completely gone, they would quickly fly down from the beam to find leftover rice grains to eat. They jumped around, and if people didn't get too close to them, they wouldn't fly away. Even if they flew away occasionally, they would only stand on the beam for a while, and then "whoosh" they would fly down again. There was no door in front of the dining hall, only a long row of wooden fences, so even in the most urgent situation, they could fly away freely. However, I had no intention of hurting them anymore, and I even deliberately left a little more rice grains on the table for them to eat. As long as they were not afraid of me, I would have a "happy heart." Lies (Blowing) Wang Chonghui stayed in Guangdong and exchanged views with various parties. Wang said that Hu Zhentang would not enter Beijing temporarily due to the cold spring. Tan Lao San said, I only hear the sound of the young lady's feet, but I don't see the young lady coming downstairs. I don't know what medicine is sold in the gourd? It's really a twelve-foot-tall monk, making people unable to figure it out. Regarding the issue of dividing the Shengsi Island, which belongs to Chongming County, the two parties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have a fierce dispute. Tan Lao San Tan Xixiang Ji cried and said, Only for the sake of a false reputation, a small profit, breaking up the mandarin ducks, one on this side, one on that side, one sigh after another, it's really good to watch. The Teacher's Wife Shi Dai When I was twelve years old, my father sent me to Xu San Longzi, a small stove maker in Qinglong Town, to learn a craft. At that time, the master Xu San Longzi did not teach me the work of a small stove maker, but always told me to sweep the yard, feed the pigs, feed the livestock, water the vegetables, and fetch water... This went on for a month. At the beginning of the second month, he taught me how to light the stove and hit the cone. Gradually, the teacher's wife became dissatisfied with the master! You can't make the apprentice do everything yourself. I can't do without a helper! The master was famous for being afraid of his wife, so of course he obeyed her words. So the teacher's wife regarded me as her only tool.</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>Before dawn, she would shout through the window: A-Kui! Get up and light the stove! Don't forget to add some grass to the livestock first. As soon as she shouted at me, I had to get up immediately and do everything she told me to do. After feeding the livestock, I would light the fire. Sometimes I would deliberately hit the anvil hard with the tongs, and she would scold me: —You eight-king bastard! Are you going to commit murder? Did your mother do something that goes against the natural order, that she raised such a lowly thing as you! When she was angry, she wouldn't let me eat all day long. But I still had to do the work. When my father came to see them with gifts during the festival, she would tell my father all sorts of wonderful things, saying that I had a good heart, a clever mind, and that I wasn't greedy or lazy. She also said: Don't worry, when the three years of apprenticeship are over, I guarantee he'll be much better than his master! Pity will never break out in her heart. She has the unique cruelty of women. No matter who she treats, she has a general coldness that penetrates the lungs! It seems that she looks down on and hates all the people in the world. In her eyes, people are all cowardly fools! So she has a tough personality, and every move she makes is enough to show that she wants to bring the whole world into her own hands. She uses bewitching wit on her husband, manipulating her husband's rational sovereignty. Her willful cruelty makes her husband swallow the constantly forced pain in humiliation. She has no children of her own and hates others having children. If a woman in the neighborhood has a child, she will cough and sigh and say a lot of idle words that no one pays attention to. —It's going to be a disaster! There are so many people, and they keep raising them. One day there will be so many people that there will be no place to stand, and then the sky will collapse and crush all these people to death... Every day after dinner, she would call me to grind the mill: —There's no more cornmeal. Grind some for tomorrow. Look at your lazy face! Are you tired from grinding the mill? Sometimes she would seem very concerned about me, telling me stories of the past, wanting me to learn well. She said that heroes are not afraid of humble origins. Liu Bei was a straw sandal seller, and Guan Gong used to push a small cart and carry things for people... —There's no water to make dinner. Go and fetch some quickly! If I finished hitting one cone and then went to fetch water, she would scold me: —You lazybones! Are you growing hair in your ears? I've been telling you for a long time and you don't go. Are you daring to make trouble with me? I'm hoping you'll learn a craft well, learn how to be a person, and when you grow up, you can rely on your craft to make a living and start a family! But you just don't live up to expectations, and you're always fond of eating and lazy, and you treat other people's words as wind in your ears... At night, as soon as I took off my clothes and lay down, she would call me to get up, close the chicken coop, and add grass to the livestock. I endured it, and the long days were spent in endurance. My Friend Hei Ding Twilight. I came out of a bookstore on Fourth Road. On the way home, just as I stepped onto Tianhou Palace Bridge, suddenly, my vision was blocked by a young man's face. I stopped. I began to observe the young man's face with the eyes of my memory. I seemed to be having a dream, but the young man also seemed to be touched by my face. He was facing me with a faint smile. He didn't say a word. His eyes were full of loving affection. When he unnaturally stretched out his trembling and large palm and tightly held my hand, I suddenly felt sure that he was my friend. "Ah, Lao Li, when did you leave Beiping?" I laughed like crazy. But he didn't answer me immediately. He put aside what I asked him, and began to say this to me laboriously, cracking his lips: "I've come to Shanghai, but Shanghai is a deep and wide sea... I'm now sinking to the bottom of the sea! I struggle, I jump..." His words filled my heart with a layer of gloomy black clouds. I widened my eyes to look at the sky: a drizzle was falling from the sky. I lowered my head again. At this time, the yellow and turbid water of the Suzhou River floated up a layer of floating smoke, like a gray and white net. The sky was gradually darkening. The clock of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had already passed five o'clock. I sighed deeply. I thought about the words I had just asked him. He didn't answer me. I suspected that he hadn't heard my words. So I asked again: "So when did you leave Beiping?" "Ah, ah,</p>
