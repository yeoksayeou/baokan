<h3>中國重任國聯理事</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>在這次的國際聯盟大會中。同我們最有關係的議題。是行政院非常任理事員額的增加。由中國佔得一席的問題。據外電所傳。國聯大會第一委員會。卽法理規章委員會已於上月二十四日舉行會議。討論這個問題。當通過决議案。主張向大會提出建議。俾行政院非常任理事員額。得自九席增至十一席。其中一席以之畀予中國。另一席則由葡萄牙保持之。現在國聯大會雖還未通過第一委員會之報吿。但依據向例。委員會的建議。大會是沒有不通過的。所以從這次國聯大會以後。中國又得在日內瓦的和平殿堂中。佔得一個非常任理事的席位了。</p>
<p>中國是亞洲的第一個大國。也是擁護國聯最力的國家。可是國聯却太不注意我們在遠東的地位了。在過去十餘年中。中國之當選為行政院非常任理事者僅有三次。而競選或要求連任失敗者。却也有三次之多。最後一次的失敗。就是在一九三四年。那時正當遠東的侵略者宣布退出國聯。行政院中沒有一個亞洲國家的代表在內。當時中國提出連任的要求。以為一定有當選的希望。可是國聯的有限理事員額。早已分配於各洲的幾個國家。以致中國連連任的賽格也沒有得到。我們自從這次競選失敗後。就改變方法。於去年國聯大會中提出增加理事員額的問題。當由行政院决議組繙理事員額分配委員會。從事研究。這委員會於四月間决議增加理事二人。一席由中國担任的建議。向行政院提出報吿。五月問的行政院常會已照例通過。現在又提交大會通過。經過多年的艱辛奮鬥。我們的目的終於達到了。</p>
<p>中國之應在行政院中佔得一個重要的地位。是有很充足的理由的。顧維鈞博士說得好。「自一九三四年以還。行政院中卽無亞洲國之代表。但行政院當以包羅萬象為原則。而亞洲方面所發生之事件。其影響可及於全世界。行政院自以直接獲得情報為得計。中國地大物博。人口甲於全球。其與國聯之合作。自始卽已異常密切。以之代表亞洲。自甚相宜」。（在二十四日第一委員會中演詞）。</p>
<p>但是我們這樣辛苦奮鬥得來的結果。對於中國究有什麽益處呢。關於這點。我們可以從國聯性質的轉改中去說明。在過去。國聯是一個强大帝國主義者的集團。但近年以來。由於最有侵略性的帝國主義國家的退出與擁護和平的國家（如蘇聯土耳共）之加入。國聯已比較地成為一個維持和平的幾關了。中國是世界上擁護和平最力的國家。現在得與國際和平機關密切合作。這自與世界和平的前途有重大的關係。而同時於我們的反對侵略與擁護和平的工作上。也有很大的影響。但這並不是說。我們可以此依賴國聯而不用自己奮鬥了。要是這樣想的話。那不但踏上了過去錯誤的道路。自趨滅亡之境。而且還更削弱了國聯的力量。因為國聯的本身是沒有力量的。它的力量全建築於會員國的身上。所謂會員國的力量就是擁護和平。反抗侵略。所以我們在當選行政院理事以後。不但不可存着依賴他人之心。而且還須用自己反抗侵略的力量。去充實國聯的勢力。因為國聯勢力的强大。實就是對於侵略帝國主義者的最大打擊。</p>

<h3>中國經濟落後的原因</h3>
<p>— 宗華</p>
<p>中國經濟，其發展過程，現在尚徘徊在手工業生產和機械工業建設的歧途中，較之先進國家落后，這是衆舉周知的實事。然而中國經濟何以落后的原因，這却言人人殊。</p>
<p>但槪括的分列，則有下面兩派：</p>
<p>（一）認為帝國主義經濟侵略，舶來品傾銷中國，摧殘了中國的民族工業發展。</p>
<p>（二）認為交通閉塞，保守思想濃厚，尤其是內亂連年，致使中國經濟無從發展。</p>
<p>這兩種說法，都有他們的見地，但是我們這裏還須明白，都有他們的見地，但是我們這裏還須明白，則，如果第一項解釋，是絕對的正確的，那末在鴉片戰爭以前，中國的社會生產力也並不曾發展，而且僅能自給半自給，這却無論如何不能歸到帝國主義的過惡上去，應該由第二者負其責。同時，反面說來，如果第二項解釋是絕對正確的。那末上海及其四周，以及京滬，滬杭鐵路沿綫，其工業發展，應該一帆風順的繁華，不致再有破產停業之虞了。今適得其反，這却不能不說是帝國主義經濟侵略的過惡。綜合的觀察，中國的經濟落后，是兩面的。則外來的壓迫和內部的牽制相包團，致使中國的經濟發展，有進一步退一步之勢。蓋</p>
<p>（一）海禁開放，舶來品傾銷中國，本來可以刺激中國民族工業的發動，而中國，由於外人投資的反映，現代潮流思想之迎合一般新興人物之心理，所以使中國工業化的思想意識趨於濃厚。然而，另一面適得其反。因為帝國主義技術純熟的舶來品傾銷，足以摧殘中國民族工業的發展。而由於中日馬關條約中有任便准許外人在沿海口岸設立工廠的明文，足使中國的民族工業發展，由外人來操縱霸佔。結果，中國境內的工業愈發展，中國民生愈破產。同時殖民地化的程序加深，人民不能受其利，簡直和中國工業化的過程尚始相等。</p>
<p>（二）交通閉塞，保守思想濃厚，本來可以使中國的國貨推銷造成一種便利的局面。而其中，內亂連年，更應該使外入投資者相率裏足不前，使民族工業，因戰爭的需要而造成軍需景氣的局面。但是，實事又得其反，因為心理上的保守思想雖然濃厚，而意識上的價廉物美的物品，却反觸目。結果，舶來品可以不脛而走到窮鄉僻壤，並不因交通閉塞，有所阻礙，而中國固有的手工業，却反被打倒了。同時，在內戰中，外商因其武力後援的條約保障，對於封建軍閥之跋扈根本卽無所顧忌，反可以乘機發展其勢力（如內戰發生，怡和太古的輪船營業便佳）或吞併收買國貨工廠，（在內戰中，國人每以能出售其工廠，收回血本為幸。）甚至和軍閥作成軍火貿易，軍需景氣的局面，反足為外人造成。所謂中國的工業發展，竟成為外人的勢力發展。</p>
<p>這兩種過程，有一種共通的趨勢；海禁開放以後，中國的工業是發展了，但是外人的勢力更發展了。質言之，中國的工業發展，是殖民地性的工業發展，所以發展一達某種階段，便受外來的摧殘而萎縮了。然而這較之閉關自守的靜態社會，却已有面目全非之感。而和國階段，不能再向前進展，所以是顯見落後了。</p>
<p>準是以觀，便知道中國經濟落後的原因，不能全歸咎於外來舶來品之傾銷。因為外來舶來品之傾銷，足可刺激中國民族工業發展。也不能認為舶來品之傾銷與中國毫無影響，因為至少足使中國民族工業發展全某種階段，受其梏桎。而中國經濟落後的原因，除上述理由外，尚有其主原因。此則第　派認為交通閉塞，以及內亂連年者是。茲且說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）交通閉塞，使中國內地，和都市隔離，宛如兩個世界。故工業發展，不能因之普遍。結果，僅成為畸形片面的西化，卽所謂消費以舶為品為選擇者是。而生產方面，由內地運輸至都市，其運價之昂竟較之由海外運到中國還貴，故經濟發展，在商人成本理論的比較下，反認為無此必要。經濟落後其由來也有自。</p>
<p>內亂連年，驅逐資本向都市逃亡，作地皮投費之一途。或存欵銀行，假手銀行的過渡，投資公債作高利貸的寄生生活。卽世人所謂遊資集中都市者是，因之生產無從發展，中國經濟反只有退化了。</p>
<p>這兩個原因，較之舶來品傾銷之打擊還大，中國經濟落後，內部的　　毀滅是一大原因</p>
<p>難之者或曰：這所謂內部的牽制，如戰爭內亂等，還是帝國主經濟侵略，舶來品傾銷，摧殘了國計民生所種的因。所以內亂也和外禍相連。這種主張，我從前是贊同的。現在，則有部份的意見保留了。蓋內亂本是中國歷史的產物，並非從海禁開放以後開始。况乎縱如所言，則帝國主義者原僅能操縱割據的局面存在而已，並不能直接主張割據局面的存在。設無內亂，焉來外禍？歸根的說，中國的內亂係中國人自發的。中國經濟落後，也應該歸到國人自相摧殘的內亂牽動的賬上去。完全由帝國主義負其責，用以諉過則可；而於經濟落後原因之探討及實際補救對策之擬議，則有所不可。所以歸根套一句老話，發展中國經濟，以內地安治長期保障為最大前提。</p>

<h3>尼采之悲劇的誕生　淋病在歐洲的猖獗和歛跡之前因後果</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……二年中組織防淋團體共六十除起努力工作　……確定治淋方策明令每個花柳病院絕對遵守</p>
<p>中國因為是個體教之邦，所以淋病遠不如西方各國的猖獗。留心西方風土人情的人，誰都知道歐洲對於性慾一事，是持着健碩的急進主義。尤其是在古代，他們之間，早就盛行着梅毒和淋病，當時雖屬普通易見，但並不知道這是兩種疾病，往往認為後者乃是前者的輕症。</p>
<p>直到十五世紀才創立梅毒這一名詞。據說主唱權力意志論而於德國思想界放一異彩的文豪尼采氏（Nietzsche），也為此病所侵襲，李槃朶克氏讀了他的悲劇的誕生　Gebur　tder　Tragodie　一書也說他患了此症。然而這個時候，淋病仍被認為梅毒的特殊症候。自從一八七九年Neisser氏發見淋菌後，一般對於淋病的認識，以及治療的方法，才有了正確的目標。不過療法多有未善擺了。像透膜殺菌療法的失敗，就因為只顧到局部，沒有顧到體內的淋毒。</p>
<p>歐洲各個國家，鑑於淋病日益猖獗，於是發起全歐醫學界的總聯合，組織防淋團體，據聞通訊社傳出消息，兩年之中他們已組織成六十多個團體，協力剷除淋病，他們所惟一信賴的除淋武器，便是蛋白體黃色素合製劑「克淋儂」原來克「克淋濃」為德國Bided博士二十八年來研究的心血結晶，博士是全以歐淋病的權威者，凡其他淋病專家。及創製淋藥的醫藥學博士，都是Biede　的學生。故不管淋藥如雨後春筍的出世，而各國政府仍一致竭力推行「克淋儂」一藥，並且明令全歐花柳病院中，絕對遵守施行本劑，所以「克淋儂」的治淋，已成為一種經典上的寶訓。（道南按：余自俄京莫斯科勞衝醫科大學畢業後，曾在莫斯科生殖器醫院任主任醫師，凡男女急慢性淋濁及關節真睪丸炎等。用之莫不脫手而愈，惟婦女白帶則以同時外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥更佳！</p>
<h3>如何消滅縱慾戕身與手淫惡習之疾</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>許多無識青年，每因性的衝刺與劣友之引誘，或因父母抱孫心切，恒令未成熟青年結婚，以遂向平之願，豈知縱慾戕身，射精管與勃起神經因而脆弱，失去健全機搆，所以遺精之患陡然而來。且漸次釀成早洩習慣。若在病勢未深之遺精病，以服用「耐而斯遺精片」一藥最有良效。因此片有鎮攝神經，鞏固精關，俾精液不致無端逸泄之苦。余用此片治余一方姓青年，彼因手淫無度，旋即患遺精病，幸調治甚早余以此片教其依法服用，未三星期，手淫惡停飛不生，故惡癖因而戒絕，而遺精之患亦獲愈矣。惟記憶圖片，頭暈症未除此由手淫而來所遺之神經衰弱也，乃囑服「補體康」至二星期左右而獲痊，今在其大學攻讀，每試輙列前茅。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>輕視淋之病轉變</p>
<p>何謂無妄之炎，即無過而來之禍害也。例如淋病患者，本多由狎邪而起。此則由於自己不慎而來之應得結果。但患者，旣自知病係有傳染異性之危險，毫不愛惜自己之妻子，往往於無意中將淋病傳染於她。妻子旣染淋毒，復不為之治愈，又於無意中將白帶易沾染小兒眼內，遂致失明。以本可根治之淋病，祇因輕視失治，以致妻子皆受此無妄之災言之誠堪寒心也。</p>
<p>原來淋菌具頑強之抗毒力而又富有傳染性。雖偶然接觸一次，即可傳染，何之同衾，夫婦？統計余自臨床以來之十數年中，凡已結婚之患者，百分百妻無子皆有淋毒性白帶。茲示一例於此患者匡景胤君，居山西路某弄，於狎邪之後，染得白濁，旣失醫治，又瞞妻子，致其夫人亦染淋病甚劇，一子產下未幾卽患失明，旋亦夭殤，夫婦十分悲痛，後又有孕，誠恐又蹈覆轍，决心乞余醫治，診之知已復為慢性攝護腺炎與精囊炎合併症，卽投以德國「克淋儂」以搜刮病灶深部中之淋菌，包圍而於殺之，更用X線及電療，俾盡量發揮「克淋儂」殺菌之功力。未四星期卽告炎消痛止尿清。惟以顯微鐘查之變微帶淋系，續服十餘天而獲根愈。其夫人之淋病，除內服「克淋儂」外一方用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥。亦四星期而愈。未幾產下一兒，肥胖可愛，毫無病態。</p>
<h3>南洋艷異記</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>婚姻自由，在椰子樹下公開戀愛</p>
<p>淫風旣熾，性病大為流行。</p>
<p>人種削弱，幸當局已籌有適當對策。</p>
<p>加雅人，是南洋一個還沒有什麼開化的民族，他們有種特異的風俗，就是在男女的交合，在白天而不在黑夜，在野林間而不在房子裏，以芳草為裀以樹林為幕，他們的理由是黑鼓夜看不清楚，而在屋子里又有小孩緾擾。我們時常在那碧天紺海，掩映生姿的美景，看到他們對對情侶，在那椰子樹下載歌載舞熱烈的狂歡，這種艷跡看了誰都都要令人心醉</p>
<p>因了他們早熟雜交和縱慾的關係，他們都患着一種共同的性病，就是生殖器發育不能完全，及遺精病的猖獗，故平均二十多歲的男子已呈很衰老的現象。幸荷蘭當局已注意及此，派員調查了，採施適當的的措置了，前歲我同德國醫學博士高斯Gauss　氏一同旅行南洋。他看到這個地方人民的性生活。也表示奇異。後來我們西人同寓一個當地的所謂紳士之家，這個紳士看去年約五十餘歲，能英語家中人口很多尤其是婦女為多約有二十歲人，。住了幾天被我們打都清楚了，原來這許多人男的都是僱來的傭工僕役，女的多是他的妻妾，僅有二個女兒，（他們並非一定要兒子）他自己其實祇有卅歲呢，後來他們也知道我們是醫生，他就要求我們替他看病，並用流利英語自述證狀說他病初為遺精，但仍不知節慾，天天沈湎酒色，所以由遺精而滑稽，往往沒有接觸女身精卽滑出了。頭痛失眠腰酸健忘等症，接着天天加多。這很顯明的是性神經衰弱了呌他服「補體康」後來他到星加坡買了二打，還沒有服完，病就完全好了。人也年青得多，看去只像卅歲，可說前後判若二人。這完全因為「補體康」是用壯健動物荷爾蒙製成，效力偉峻而持久，，凡男子出手淫，房事過度，而來的發育不全，性神經衰弱等症，都可服用，在一月後卽可治愈了。我們治愈加雅地方紳士的病，已早由高斯博士做成論文發表亞洲醫學雜誌第十七卷十二期了。因此「補體康」一藥，更獲得全世界醫家一致採用的榮譽。</p>
<h3>肺癆療法在歐美最近之新趨勢</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學教授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>從化痰止欬的治標辦法之被打倒以至外科手術的倡行　彙集肺病專家二千人的意見創製最新之內服藥物</p>
<p>鄧醫師診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>肺癆的療法，不知經過多少演變，才能達到今日的這種最新的姿態。自然，這是由於二十世紀科學的急進之故。那些對於肺癆的治標方法，如化痰止欬等不着實際的藥療，現在是一律打倒了。凡是有着醫學常識的人，必定知道近世歐洲各國治療肺癆的一個最新趨勢，那就是經過Saugmann　V，Muron　Brauer　等氏研究成功後的人工氣胸衛，以及　Saueabruch　博士的橫膈膜神經切除，與由　Sauerbruch　改良之胸廓形成術等法。這些療法雖屬於外科，但他的目的和效用則是令患病的肺靜止與安靜，促進患部石灰質的增殖，以包圍癆菌。一方因羅患肺呼吸機能之减退，對於病灶組織的酸素供給，便可减少，而癆菌也就失却生存的力量。</p>
<p>為着手術的不易施行，而且患者需要適合的環境。所以藥物的治療，近年又逐漸潛佈着他的勢力，德粵瑞士間的肺病專家，約有二千名以上的人數　集了各人意見，認為根據上述手術療法效用之原理，製以內服藥物，卽可收到外科治療的實益，而得免除手術的危險。一九一〇年美爾約克博士發明了鈣鹽製劑，已能使肺部石灰質增加，頗得學者的贊許。後由瑞士著名肺病學家徒梅博士，改良他的藥劑，集思廣益，製成「補肺拿爾」一藥，用於男女各期肺癆的欬血欬嗽，咯痰胸痛，發熱，盜汗等症候，都有特異效能，肺病療法，這才轉換最近這個新的階段。原來「補肺拿爾」的藥理作用，可以收縮患肺部的呼吸機能，减少酸素，供給石灰質，而予癆菌以極大的頓挫！故其效力深得全球各名醫之好評。如患者兼有神經衰弱，失眠困瘦，男子遺精陰萎，婦女月經不調，可同時並服男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，則精神自旺或體重易增矣。</p>
<h3>婦女萎黃病</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>原因何在？</p>
<p>如何根治？不治有何危險？</p>
<p>婦女萎黃病之主要原因，不外子宮與卵巢機能之失常，吾人常見月經不調，神經衰弱乳房發育不佳之婦女，多有此病，面色蒼黃，唇爪慘白，四肢倦怠，呈極度貧血狀態，且因月經不調，中怔忡，腰酸腳弱，白帶下，小腹膨脹或割痛。快感減少，久婚無孕。</p>
<p>德國梅倫博士，為二十世紀內分泌學之權威，所發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，為科學上之新貢獻。其「補女容」一藥，對於婦女病中之萎黃病，確具卓特功效。因其有調整卵巢機能，矯正子宮生理，並能催使乳房發育也。余前在南能醫科大學肄業時，嘗讀希臘魯克Luke氏醫學博士（森丁堡大學婦科教授）之論文，謂彼在用「補女容」一藥，治愈一年廿八歲未育之女子萎黃病，其症狀複雜，有如上述。經過五星期治療，卒獲全愈。余由畢業自設醫院以來，恒用「補女容」治愈此病百數十餘人，其白帶下者同時外用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥，依法療法，雖每個患者亦可自醫，無須求叩醫生之門云。</p>
<h3>尿道硬性浸潤之險象</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>尿道縱襞减少　小便困難</p>
<p>患者張崇道君，年卅一歲，罹淋病因屢次反覆，致成慢性後尿道炎之硬性浸潤，用尿道鏡檢查之，其侵潤部份，不能察出粘膜之縱皺襞，完全失去健康狀態，上皮粘膜時有脫落作糜爛狀海綿體閉鎖，（如第一圖。）小便極度困難，故時因積尿關係，成尿中毒而致失如神，狀頗危殆，由友人方順庵君商余為之救療，乃為之用手術排清尿液，以救其急後，更投以德國「克淋儂」，以消炎鎮痛防腐利尿，經過三星期後，病已大有好轉，排尿快利，復以尿道鏡檢查這，縱襞漸加，惟尚未完全恢復健全之態，仍囑繼續服「克淋儂」至一星期後，再用尿道鏡檢查之，則縱襞已增至健康狀態矣。（如第二圖）。按此症如不急事救治，恒致結締織增殖，而失去尿道伸縮自由，更由尿中毒致死。亦淋病中一險症也。</p>

<h3>消化不良者的厄運</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……胃陽障碍的各種病態曲曲寫出　……食慾為健康的條件最不容忽視</p>
<p>生物學家　Coulber　教授，曾說生物的第一個生存條件，便是飲食，牠們必須有充足的營養，始能延長生命，反之，牠們便將萎弊而不能與自然相抵抗了。這是千古不磨之論，只要看人類之中的壯健者，他們沒有不具着大量食慾的。這就證明了消化好的人，營養必然豐富，體力也就強盛。在醫學上，強壯正是必需的，不然的話，那就是病態。因此，消化不良的人，便是胃陽有着病變的徵候。在初步的時候，人們往往不自覺。等到病勢一深，於是嘔吐，噁心，噁酸，噯氣等，就隨之而來。有的成為胃痛，有的則惡化為胃潰瘍的大吐血，危險到極點。</p>
<p>我在陸軍醫科大學畢業後，曾充任軍醫多年，兵士因粗茶糙飯，致患胃腸病的很多，我屢用「強胃精」一藥，投之如前述的胃病者，均獲捷效。又對於大便秘結，腹痛，或多飲湯水，胃部膨脹等，皆著奇騐。其他如口臭，見食生畏，招寒腹瀉，痢疾，服此藥沒有不會痊愈的。</p>

<p>欬嗽的病變底險惡，已成為週知之事實。而最危險的，却是肺炎和肺癆了。據考勒莫傑氏（奧籍肺病專家）的統計，平均每八十中，即有七十九人的肺癆是從傷風欬嗽而來的。而肺炎症之起因，更是百分之百起於傷風。肺炎可以令人暴斃，輕一點的，就轉為肺癆，的確。秋天的攝生稍一不慎，欬嗽便要沾染。患欬嗽的人，即使不明白肺炎症的轉歸如何句危險，也該記取久欬內傷的科話，而思自救。我在南通醫一大學時，自從研究了世界著名肺病者徒梅博士的深奧的學理，便堅信了他發明的「補肺拿爾」的藥理作用，畢業後在西湖肺病醫院担任醫務，經用此藥試騐多數咳痰鎮欬的作用。尤其是老人的哮喘痰飲，小兒的百日咳，服了便可立奏殊功。因為含着蛋黃素，對於虛人和病後的乾咳，烟民的欬痰，都具卓效。</p>

<h3>德斐Humphrey　Davy（1778－1829）</h3>
<p>— 張樹英</p>
<p>發明安全燈的化學家</p>
<p>從前煤坑中採掘煤炭的工人，他們最怕的是煤坑中的瓦斯，接觸火熖，而發生如山崩地裂的大爆發，因為這種大爆發，不但會使全坑崩潰，並且會使在坑內工作的全體工人喪失生命。然而這並不是坑內一有瓦斯，就會爆發，牠的爆發是因為和火熖接觸而引起的，如竭力使牠不和火熖接觸，牠就不會爆發成災了。因此坑內不許用燈火，但工人們是在坑內採掘煤炭，坑內既不用燈火，又絕無其他光綫射入，在黑暗中慘淡工作，其苦自不待言。所以他們大家都希望有人能够發明决不會引起爆炸的安全燈給他們用。後來德斐眞的發明了他們理想的安全燈。工人們高興極了，他們便稱他做大恩人。這樣有功於社會的學者，的確値得我們萬分敬仰的。</p>
<p>德斐於一七七八年生於英國的比薩斯村，父親是一個貧窮的彫刻師。德斐幼時，比其他同輩，更加活潑，並且記憶力極强，在小學校讀書的成績，均列優等。他很歡喜集合鄰近的小朋友，講述極有趣味的故事。道種講述故事的口材，也是他自己常在被人使喚或走路的時候練習好的。有一天，他母親說，一德斐：你的叔母有病，你快把這個藥瓶送去」，德斐答應之後，立刻拿着瓶子就走。在路上，他還是不斷的在熟記故事，和練習講述，他完全忘記了自己手中拿着什麽，不知不覺將藥瓶遺失了，等到到了叔母家裏時，才曉得藥瓶已經不知去向了，第二天早上有一個送牛奶的經過他掉失瓶子的地方，才把牠檢起來送還給他。</p>
<p>德斐十五歲時，不幸父親急病死了，他有兄弟五人，自己居長，這時他不得不負起全家的生活負擔。他對於自己的將來，經過熱思之後，才决定的說：「我今後專心硏究我自己所好的化學罷！只要能使母親及兄弟們安心就好了」。但他這樣决心之後，又缺乏進上級學校的費用，不得巳他開始尋找一面研究一面做事的機會，結果只好釗他父親的朋友畢格姆那裏，要求在他店內當職員。這位畢格姆是在比薩斯市做外科醫兼藥劑師的，幸得他肯收容德斐。</p>
<p>德斐因為决心研究化舉，所以與其他職員不同，他特別勤於工作，更努力硏究和讀書，於是大得主人之誇獎。他道棵每日過着極忙碌的生活，然而他最急切的，還是化學的實騐。他找到許多舊瓶干，烟管，茶杯，飯碗以及瓦斯容器等做實騐的器具。只要公務做完，他就乘機作種種實騐。因為他是主人畢格姆亡友之子，主人對於他的行動很注意。有一晚，他實騐某種化學的物品，臭氣薰天，於是主人對他說「德斐：停止了你的實騐罷！那麽臭的東西，誰嗅到都受不了的」。但德斐對於研究化學，非常熱心，不肯因為人家阻止，便不試騐，他只好一面極和氣的求主人寬恕，一面把試騐的東西拿到離人較遠的地方來工作。他對於植物葉子所發之酸，以及海草極小細胞的空氣作用，都很細心研究。</p>
<p>德斐後來得進一個很好的圖書館去做硏究的工作。並且在圖書館裏認識格來哥里（瓦特之子），格來哥里敎他不少化學的知識。不久他到普里斯特爾地方，作「空氣療病實騐所」的助手，這時他對於氣體開始引起研究的興趣。經他再三活動，又得到一瓦斯硏究所內做事，他從來是一面被駡一面還要實騐的人，所以到了研究所後，竟似飢犬找食般，硏究了一點又一點，不斷的熱心研究，對「笑瓦斯」作了重要的實騐，他觀察牠的特別的生理作用，由此發明麻醉劑，在外科醫術上貢獻甚大。後來改良電池，並發表他研究的結果，大得世界上的科學家尊崇。一八〇三年，他才二十三歲，便被聘為倫敦皇家協會的講師。他當初不過是一藥店職員，不過十數年的努力，便做了敎授。但他，不但絲毫不自傲，反而更加熱心研究，不怪他會成為世界有名的化學家。</p>
<p>當時英國煤業甚盛，但因坑內時常發生爆炸，工人們無不談虎色變，他們的生命，朝不保夕，所以爆炸的事情，竟成當時最大問題之一。無不希望有人發明防止瓦斯爆炸的方法。有一天德斐到煤山上來，坑夫們早知道他是，一個有名的化學家，大家都向他請敎，問他能否發明不會引起煤坑爆發的安全燈。</p>
<p>在德斐以前，雖有許多學者及技術家們硏究安全燈，但均未成功，一八一三年，英國的克拉尼博士也曾發明一種安全燈，但因使用麻煩，極不適用。其次為發明蒸氣車的喬始，斯蒂芬孫，製一種安全燈，當時雖亦為坑夫們當重寶使用，但構造上尙未十分完善。</p>
<p>德斐接受了這困難問題後，他先硏究爆發瓦斯的性質，常常到鑛山上實地研究，最初他發見「火熖不能通過極細的管子」的可驚的事實，再經他細心硏究之後，他更明白「細鐵絲網也是一種細管的集合體」，於是他就用細鐵絲網做成圓筒，這細鐵絲圓筒，旣可放入油燈所需要的空氣，又可使火熖不通到外面來。據一般想像，瓦斯也是一種氣體，自然會跟着空氣進去，而引起爆發了吧？其實不然的，瓦斯雖然也會到圓筒內，但却立刻要變成火熖，火熖旣不與外面的瓦期接觸，就不會引起爆發了。這是多麽可驚的發見啊！經他多次實騐，於是發明安全燈。</p>
<p>德斐在實騐安全燈的時候，有一位呌赫德生的牧師，也隨時居中帮忙，他相信科學的力量。德斐最初的安全燈發明成功，是赫德第一個人提着牠，走入充滿瓦斯的煤坑中作冒險的實騐。當他進入深處時，很遠的地方，有一個坑夫，在陰濕黑暗中工作，看着遠方有人提火進來，駭得魂飛魄散，大聲疾呼「熄火！熄火！」他認為坑內的火光，正是引他們至於死地的。可是火光漸漸進來，他只好跪下祈禱上帝保佑其生命，然而火光雖然走近他的身旁，並未引起爆發。這是多麽不可思議和神秘的火啊！德斐的安全燈，從此得了鐵的保證。此次實騐成功後，德斐喜出望外，世界各地都給他贊詞。工人們得此救命重寳，感激到流淚。英國煤炭業，更為他開盛大的慶祝宴會，並贈以名貴的紀念品，俄國也送感謝書及大花瓶來給他。</p>
<p>德斐除發明安全燈外，又發明弧光燈，這弧光燈就是一切電燈，X光綫，以及無綫電話等之起源。</p>
<p>德斐於一八二〇年被選為皇家協會的會長，一八二一年並得政府之爵位。他在科學界上有如此偉大的貢獻，巳經値得人崇拜，但他更令人不能忘記的，是他提拔了法拉第。法拉第後來成為世界有名的發明電磁感應的化學家，幾乎全是德斐栽培之力。他們兩人都成了近代電氣科學最大的偉人。</p>
<p>德斐終生潛心硏究，但可惜他因實騐瓦斯損害了健康，老年更加多病，不能作激烈的硏究，要到海外漫遊·一八二九年五月他在瑞士日內瓦湖畔，病死了，年紀才五十一歲。</p>
<h3>周處</h3>
<p>— 徐如本</p>
<p>晋朝宜興有個周處，字子隱，他的父親曾做過都陽太守。周處在幼年的時侯，喜歡習武，練出很大的膂力，普通的人是打不過他的。他的父親是個淸官，死後沒有積蓄，周處就奉他的母親回到宜興來，以打獵養親。</p>
<p>周處因為沒人管敎，一天一天學壞了，不久便吃喝嫖賭，無所不為。同時他的性情很暴烈，好打不平，鄉里的父老，沒有一個不恨他怕他的。甚至有一看見他的影子，就跑開避他了，周處看到這種情形，日久也有些覺悟了，心裏想：「這總是我的不是，平常嫖賭吃喝，好管閑事，又任性得罪人，人家怎能不討厭我呢？我現在年紀大了，總該立志做人，幹一番轟轟烈烈的事業才是」。怎好一輩子做無賴呢？</p>
<p>他悶悶的自心裏打算着，信步走到郊外，無目的地四處閒蕩，忽然遇着一位白髮的老頭子。這老頭子愁眉苦臉，像有很大的苦衷似的。周處馬上動了憐愛之心，問道：</p>
<p>「老丈，年歲好，世界又太平，你老為什麽這樣愁苦不樂呀？」！</p>
<p>那老者看了他一眼，嘆口氣說：</p>
<p>「地方上有三個大害，沒有除掉，還談到什麽快樂呀了」！</p>
<p>周處很驚異的問道：</p>
<p>「這是什麽話呀？我不懂」。</p>
<p>老者說：「南山的白額猛虎，長橋下的大蛟，還有「你一！這不是三個大害嗎」？</p>
<p>周處聽到這話，不假思索，很乾脆的說道：「這有什麽要緊呢！我來替你除掉，不是就好了嗎？」</p>
<p>老者聽到他的話，半信半疑的帶着諷刺的口吻說：「你如果眞的能够除掉，就是一郡人民的幸福，不僅是除害而已」。</p>
<p>周處也不說什麽，到家帶了弓箭，佩好刀劍，獨自一人，到南山裏找白額虎去。費了一天工夫才找着牠，周處氣極了，拔出利箭搭上弓弦，對準猛虎，使勁一放，那箭好像是流星一樣的射去，正中虎身。猛虎受了傷，大吼一聲，狂奔而去。勇敢的周處，緊追着牠，三拳兩脚便把牠打死了。</p>
<p>第二天，他赤着膊，站在長僑上面，預備下水斬蛟。宜興的民衆，聽說周處要下水斬蛟，大家無不爭先恐後的來看。</p>
<p>忽然聽得「轟咚」一聲，周處跳下水了。看熱閙的人，正在凝目注視着他，忽然一股大水衝來，大家都曉得大蛟來了，一個個嚇得魂不附體，四散奔逃而去：只剩得周處一個人在浪花中掙扎着。</p>
<p>周處受盡了辛苦，忘記了危險，忘記了饑餓，忘記了一切，在水裏三天三夜，追到四十多里，將那條害人的大蛟殺死，才跳出水，，上岸到城裏來。</p>
<p>宜興的民衆，眼見周處跳到河裏，三天三夜不見回來，都猜他被大蛟咬死，或是被水淹水了，大家以為無論如何，也算除了一害，無不歡喜，互相慶賀。</p>
<p>周處回到城裏，聽見沒有人關懷他，很氣憤的說：「這樣的人心，這樣的惡劣環境，我不能再久住了，走吧！我要建功立業，做一番轟轟烈烈的事，給他們看看」。</p>
<p>他立卽回家辭別了老母，到吳國找陸雲去。他看見陸雲，便將他在宜興被人漠視的情形吿訴了一遍，並且說：「我現在想自己進修，但年歲已長，恐怕來不及了」。陸雲道：「古人說：「朝聞道，夕死可矣」！那裏有什麽來不及？你的前途無量，只怕不立志，不怕功名不成就」。</p>
<p>周處聽了陸雲的話，從此發憤讀書，謹愼做人，道德與學問一天一天的進步，前後竟像兩個人。</p>
<p>周處離鄉不到一年功夫，便做了東觀左丞；跟着又做洛陽新平太守。那裏有戎狄和鬼人時常作亂，幸虧周處撫禦有方，才能使他們服貼了。後來他又做廣漢太守，到任後，把三十餘年未决的案，很公正的處理得淸淸楚楚。</p>
<p>他是一個很孝順的兒子，他在遠方做官，一聽見母親有病，便辭職回家侍候湯藥，等到母親病好了，才再出來做官。</p>
<p>過了些日子，西戎的氐人齊萬年造反，朝裏有人嫌周處性情剛直，想借這個機會打發他遠征，托辭道「周處，是一個名將之子，忠烈果毅，可以打西戎的—」</p>
<p>只有伏波將軍孫秀知道其中陰謀而同情於周處的，對周處說：「你有老母，正好借這個題目堅辭」。周處很慷慨的答道；「忠孝之道，不能兩全的時候，只好捨孝取忠。我已經决意為國捐軀了。謝謝你的好意」！</p>
<p>消息一天一天的緊，朝廷忙派梁王彤，夏侯駿和周處統領大軍，討伐西戎。西戎的齊萬年統着大兵，屯駐在梁山，和夏侯駿的營盤很近，夏侯駿遣五千人馬去攻打；周處說：</p>
<p>「軍隊沒有後援，是一定敗的；我們雖然志在必死，但是徒替國家取恥，未免犯不着啊」！話雖有理，無奈夏侯駿不聽。</p>
<p>在快開始戰爭的時候，周處統率的一枝人馬，還沒有吃飯，梁王彤逼着他進攻，並且斷絕他的後援。周處自知必敗，但還决定振起精神，於他那射虎斬蛟的本領，和敵人拚個你死我活。用是他便和振威將軍盧播，雍州刺史解系，攻打齊萬年於六陌。</p>
<p>從晚間一直戰到黎明，周處等斬了敵人萬多個首級。但終竟因為衆寡不敵被打敗包圍了。此時盧播和解系都泰了梁玉彤的密令，坐視不救。周處的左右勸周處暫時退守。他睜圓兩眼，按劍氣忿忿的說道：</p>
<p>「這正是我効忠國家的日子，為什麽退？古來良將受命，總是從凶門出來，表示有進無退的决心。現在各軍背信，光景一定不能振作，我旣是大臣，以身殉國，還不好嗎！」</p>
<p>說罷！大吼一聲，又衝殺前去，就這樣在千刀萬箭之下殉國了。</p>
<p>這個不幸的消息傳來，人人哀慟，朝廷追贈他做平西將軍，賜田置產養他的母親。到了晋元帝的時候，追封他做孝侯。因為他忠烈動人，愈久愈令人愛慕他。</p>

<h3>雜誌界的畸形發展</h3>
<p>— 周斐</p>
<p>從讀書界購買力的薄弱影響到單行本在書業市塲上地位的衰落，一二年來上海（也可以代表全國）雜誌的勃與乃是一個必然的趨勢。我們相信，雜誌的本質是代替得了單行本的，而事實上，使我們失望得很，目前的雜誌界却跨進了畸形發展的途徑上去了！</p>
<p>在「論語」全盛時期，已分明暴現了中國雜誌界危險的前途；乾脆地說：也就是暴現了中國知識靑年危險的前途。無論大學生中學生，差不多一見了面，就是一個「你這期論語買了沒有？」，安閒，俏皮的氣息毒害了他們；這些雜誌的效果僅僅給於靑年羣衆躺在臥床上或是　在廁所裏作一度的消閑而巳。</p>
<p>自從開闢了這一條歪曲的道路以後，中國雜誌界遂展開了一個更可怕的塲面。踏進雜誌公司的門限，昭示在我們眼前的：封面無一不女人，內容無一不低級趣味。與其說所看到的是雜誌，母寗說是參觀照片展覽。一個求知的靑年要是想在雜誌叢裏搜尋一些正當的食糧，那委實只有失望的份兒。</p>
<p>我們痛　着這種不良的畸形發展現象，同時希望出版家會覺悟這種是殺害靑年的劊子手的行為！</p>
<h3>介紹「上海市年鑑」</h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>這世界第五大都巿的上海，不論工商百業，敎育文化，金融狀况，都佔到非常重要的地位。它的榮枯盛衰，不僅影響到整個，中國，而且影響到整個的世界。上海市的地位旣如此重要，而上海市一切事業的內容，也瞬息萬變，錯綜複雜。在這瞬息萬變錯綜複雜的事態中，當然自有其歷史上的因果，人事上的變遷，以及世界之影響上海市，或上海之影響全世界的種種原因在內。唯其如此，因此一切的政治家，歷史家，以及經濟學者，企業家等，都急切地需要一本紀載上海情况的專書。然而過去的上海市政當局並沒有注意到，而上海市的出版界，也沒有這種大的力量可以供給這中外人士所共同急切需要的這種專書。</p>
<p>在去年間，上海市通志館出版了一本民國二十四年的「上海市年鑑」，雖然內容並不十分精詳完備，然而已博得了社會人士的贊美，各界稱便不少。到了今年，上海巿通志館又出版了一本民國二十五年的「上海巿年鑑」，筆者瀏覽一過，深覺取財之廣博精審，編制之簡潔醒目，內容之充實完備，遠勝於前，這我們深引以為快慰的事。</p>
<p>據筆者看來，該書有下列數點，可謂最令人滿意的地方，第一，各部門除詳載一年間的經過以外，又把道部門的歷史，扼要叙述，源流沿革，瞭如指掌，讀此文後，儼然自己曾親歷其境，頗覺親切而詳細。第二，各部門除用文字紀載外，並以統計表格，詳為列舉，淸晰明白，自較單用文字者為佳。第三，該年鑑對於每一事件，除有國歷年月日之註明外，復附記公元，讀者自亦稱便不少。</p>
<p>該年鑑分二十四、類：第一類為特　，包括巿中心區之新建設等；第二類為大事概要，將二十四年度內之全運會，識字運動，禁烟運動，新生活運動，航空救國運動等，詳為列入；第三類為土地與人口；第四類為天時與氣象；第五類為黨務，將上海黨務史略，工作狀况等，都一一列人；第六類為行政，首從上海巿之歷史說起，繼述上海市政各機關組織與行政狀况等；第七類為司法，從上海司法機關歷史上的變遷說起，將目前各司法機關的組織現狀等，都分別予以闡述；第八類為外交，將中外各國駐滬外交機關的歷史，職權，工作概况等，都有扼要精詳的紀載；第九類為軍備，上海市各軍事機關的組織，我國在滬海陸空軍的現狀，以外各國駐滬兵力的統計等，都分別紀載；第十類為財政，關於財務行政，歲入歲出狀况，市公債的情形，中央各駐漱財政機關的現狀等，都有明確的調查；第十一類為金融，關於上海市金融業歷史上的部鬥，金融機關的現况，銀錢兩業的現勢等，都有詳盡的紀戰；第十二類為敎育，上海市敎育的縱的說明，以及橫的現狀等，都一一列人；而於敎育統計一項，尤見精詳；第十三類為交通，關於鐵路，公路，航運，以及交通工具，道路碼頭等，都有詳細的紀載；第十四類為工業，關於歷史上的部份，該年鑑以「一二八」事件為劃分綫；而於各種工業的現狀，中外工業在滬競爭的情形，亦有詳盡的說明；第十五類為勞工，勞工生活狀况的調查，勞工行政的現况，以及勞工團體，勞資爭議，勞工福利事業等，都有明確的叙述；第十六類為商業，對於商業機關，商業團體，國際貿易，以及各業狀况等，都有正確的調查和統計；第十七類是農林漁牧，關於農業，林園，漁業，畜牧等，均有扼要的叙述；第十八類是學藝，關於二十四年度的文化界趨勢，出版界狀况，以及文化團體的調查等；第十九類為宗敎；第　十類為社會事業，包括衛生事業，新聞事業，運動事業，慈善事業，電影事業等；第二十一類為第一特區公共租界的沿革，人口，行政狀况等；第二十二類為第二特區法租界的沿革，人口，行政狀等；第二十三類為時事日誌；第二十四類為附錄，在這附錄中有二張簡要的表格，尤値得我們注意。第一個表是民國二十六年的上海曆，每月一表，上半註明氣節之日期，日出日沒之時刻，例假及紀念日等；下半則註明上海歷史上之火事，以資參考。第二張表是民國紀元前近百年中西歷對照簡表，用以檢查過去，頗為便利。</p>
<p>這民國二十五年出版的「上海市年鑑」，的確比民國二十四年出版的「上海巿年鑑」精詳得多，旣可為現代一般人的參閱，復為最可靠的史料，筆者特鄭重地介紹給全國國人之前！</p>
<h3>從「論語」到「逸經」</h3>
<p>— 宜夫</p>
<p>可是在三月份裏，却另出了兩種兄弟行的刋物，卽「天地人」和「逸經」是。「地人」是由徐訐，孫成編輯的，「逸經」的社長為簡又文，編輯為謝與堯，而徐訐和簡又文都和「人間世」發生關係過的，所以表面上仍可視為「論語」派的姊妹，不，或者認為兄弟，是較為適切的</p>
<p>但是細查該而刋物的內容，則和「論語」派有顯然的不同。「天地人」的編者徐訐君，則明明表示自己幷不是幽默派或提倡晚明小品者，他說：</p>
<p>「我前後也寫點零碎的詩文，但不外乎是自己的內感，或者是對環境的感觸，……我不很知道小品，晚明的小品尤其讀得太少，……我自從幼少時背過四書五輕以外，後來只看過古文辭類篡以及十八家詩鈔等等，再以後我隨意看看的總是子書之類，晚朋小品一點沒有讀着。這是他的自白，就是表明自己幷沒有受到晚明小品的薰染。他辦「天地人」，是想要成為一個「比較少年」的刋物，說的是自己的話，內容是包括實際的智識，想隨時互助，隨時規勸，不懷疑妬忌，成了一個「大我親切的空氣，與現代靑年相接近的。那末這態度的懇切和嚴肅，自然和幽默的論調不相同了。（未完）</p>

<p>各國留學生槪况</p>
<p>二十一日留德學生會舉行茶會、同時舉行全德大會、席間由各國學生會會長報告各國留學生及學生會槪况、據留德學生會會長江鴻稱、留德學生近年來因德國生活程度不高、並且使用登記馬克的原因、人數大增、現在總計的九百人、其中在柏林者的二百餘人、各大城凡有留學生者、都有學生分會的組織、至留德學生會成立已二十多年、近年來每年舉行中德友誼會及跳舞會一次、門票收人卽以充作　生會的經費尚足應付云云、留義學生會會長石孝先稱、留義學生在二十年前祇有三人、八年前增加六人、至三年前人數才漸見增加、現在共一百二十三人、學生會於本年四月才組織成立、與義國法西斯黨及外交界都有相當聯絡、最近發起募欵購機祝蔣委員長五十壽辰、已得一萬五千里拉、學生會本身經費、則　　窘迫、留荷學生會會長陳　　稱、留荷學生約一百餘人　　多為當地僑胞學生會　　已久、基金極為充足、但僑胞久離祖國、目頗多在國外生長者、對祖國言語文字、均不明瞭、亟應設法補救、留英學生會會長鄭康祺稱、留英學生會已有四十年的歷史、全英現共有十一個分會、每年暑假開會一次、留英學生現的四百人、以在倫教者為多、研究社會科學與自然科學者各居其半因為英國人性格的沉默、與氣候惡劣的關係、留學生大都埋頭苦讀、很少做課外的活動與娛樂、留奧學生會會長徐中齊答、留奧學生共三十人、以學醫者為最多、計十二人、警士五人、音樂化學各三人、政治經濟及工程各二人、造紙法律外交各一人、學生會亦於本年始組織成立、留比學生代表吳運庚稱、比國生活程度在歐洲為最低、而工業亦最為　達、所以到比國留學的人大多是研究工科的窮苦學生、學生會會幾度織、因無事可做、又幾度解散、最近一年重行組織、規定每年雙十節在比京舉行全體大會、以後也許可使組織、益趨健全、留法學生代表郭寶珠稱、留法學生的有四百餘人、最近因法國生活程度昂貴、人數漸見减少、求學地點大致為巴黎與里昂兩處、學生會始終沒有整個的組織、巴黎方面有一個書報社、還有一個中國同學會、但是並非全體雄生的組織、這次參加大會後、當設法把學生會組織起來、在波蘭留學生的祇方福森　人、他是中波文化協會所派遣的、現在工科大學研究道路工程、大的還要兩三年就可結束、方君這次也來參加會議、他被大家迫着報告他一個人在波蘭留學的情形時、引起全塲哄笑、</p>
<p>陳介生之開幕詞</p>
<p>聯合總會會長陳介生、在開幕典禮中、所致的開幕詞、對大會的意義說得很詳盡、茲介紹如次、留歐同　像今天這樣盛大的聚會、先後已經三次了、第一次是在倫敦舉行、參加的同學、有英德荷二個單位、就在這次會裏、正式成立了留歐學生聯合總會、第二次是在荷蘭舉行、參加的同學、除英德荷三個單位外、還增加了留法的同學、現在在這裏舉行第二屆年會、算是本會第　次集會了、本屆年會的舉行、剛在世運會開會之後、事先因為歡迎我國世運選手、及各國來德同學、沒有充分時間、來從事籌備、本會同人覺得非常抱歉、好在此次出席的同學、較過去特別踴躍、除留學英德荷義奧等五國學生會、正式推派代表出席本會外、還有十幾位留學法比瑞波等四國同學、自動參加、同時又蒙戴院長程大使曁諸位先生、及德國政府代表佛朗克部長、光臨指導、各大使各公使惠賜贈品、使本屆年會的意義、格外重大、兄弟謹以十分至誠代表本會同人、感謝諸位先生所給予本會的光榮、</p>
<p>自從產業革命以來、科學的功能、在西方各國、愈見顯著、然以當時歐亞交通的不便、這種功能還不能為我國所認識、直到鴉片戰爭以後、東方的國家、才知道洋槍太砲的厲害、才知這科學的功能、於是中國和日本、都先後派員到歐州來留學、兩國派遣留學生的目的、都是一樣、可是結果、却完全相反、伊籘博文和嚴復、是中日兩國差不多同時派出的留學生、然而伊籘博文完成了日本明治維新的　業、嚴復只留下幾部譯著、雖然留學生中出了一位繼往開來的孫中山先生、和他的幾位忠實信徒、可是因為大多數留　生不爭氣、經過了數十年的艱難苦鬥、革命大業、仍舊不能完全成功、幾十年來中日兩國政治舞台上的重要人物、差不多大部分都是留學生、然而日本因有留學生而强、中國雖有留學生却仍然不免陷於今日道種悲慘的境地、我們檢討過去、觀察現在、不能不承認我們留學政策、是歸於失敗了、這種失敗的原因、我們認為很多不過留學生之缺乏團結的精神、和齊一的意志則是重要原因之一、</p>
<p>我們知道要挽救中華民族的危亡、除了整個民族的團結奮鬥而外、別無他途、因為人類文明的進步、與一切事業的完成、都離不了分工合作而不分工、因此免不了衝突混亂和牽制、要免除這種矛盾、必須大家捐除個人的成見、打破學派的壁壘萬衆一心、共同奮鬥、這樣才能充實我們的力量、發揮我們的本能、達到我們報仇雪恥的目的、盡到數十年來留學生所未能盡到的責任、旅歐學生聯合總會、就是在這種意義之下產生出來的、</p>

<p>坦白的說，男女如能結成一個燦爛的美滿家庭，雙方親昵而歡暢，基本條件，必須要壯健的體魄，和聰穎機敏的頭腦。可是這兩種基本條件，在目前的淫亂社會裏顯然地起了暗礁，雖然道種暗礁，有的在新婚時代不講求性的衛生法，但是多數由於未婚時代的不講求攝養，屬於女子者，行經處置失當或攝養上注意不足，或有手淫癖，使子宮發生障碍，身體衰弱，發育不全。但最普通的，還是因了男人品行不端，罹息性病，如早期過度的手淫，因此發育受阻，最顯著者，睪丸細小，陰莖短弱；或因手淫之故，罹有遺精，神經義弱症遂致爆發，如早洩，陰萎，使婚後之性生活陷於痛苦煩惱之中，甚至完全停滯。此外為身染淋病，纏綿累月，變成慢性老濁，則早洩，陰萎無可避免。本問題解决方法最重要的關鍵，須男女雙方趕快用藥力及衛生方法以挽救之。</p>
<p>英國的一位有名性病專家哈佛洛克愛立斯博士HavelookBllis．M．D他對於內分泌學說很有研究，他證實發育不全及陽萎早洩，用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」療治，萬無一失。誠然，當余在美百特生醫院研究時，當地一位著名醫學博士魯與氏Lucian時以「生殖素」作為對早洩，陰萎，發育不全的主要療法，對於女子乳癟及月經不調等症則投以「女用生殖素」據渠證實從未失敗，不過患有淋病，或因淋病而起的性神經衰弱症，那末必須服以黃色素和伐克幸合製劑「安敵淋」，使之淸除白濁，以達根治之目標</p>

<h3>第一課　變態性慾的種類</h3>
<p>— 英國醫學博士L．Tachb著譯　賈治中醫師編</p>
<p>人類都有着性慾。不消說，性慾與食慾，本是動物的兩大本能：無論任何階級，任阿境退的人們，沒有不其有的。不過有時，這種性欲為病態的，而表現於外；在醫學上，以性慾為病態而顯於外者，區分為手淫及顚倒症二種類。</p>
<p>所謂手淫，為男女靑年所遍有，羅之者，精力斷長，精關受損，遺精，滑精，隨惡癖之程度深淺而餽移。剛成年的男女，如過度手淫，發育必被阻碍。此弊害在男性尤為顯明，如生殖器之短小無力，陰毛荒蕪，睪丸萎縮，肢體亦瘦削異常。在女子者，月經被阻，或月經異常，使身體的康健發生問題。關於補救的方法，歐美各著醫家，都重視鞏固精關，制止遺精，競推崇「希米脫氏固精片」的效力，在吾人日常行醫之經騐而斷，此法實為因手淫遺精者最可靠治本之良法也。（未完）</p>
<h3>一個「生殖素」服者的來信</h3>
<p>— （編者）</p>
<p>冒牌『生殖素』瓶裝僞品的危險</p>
<p>編輯先生：我非常慚愧，因為當我在發育之年，就曉得手淫行為，不到二年，就爆發了很劇烈的遺精病，甚至有時操勞過度，竟至滑精，因此驚惶萬分，後在貴刊上見到「希米脫氏固精片」可治遺精，及「生殖素」可治神經衰弱及發育不全等症，乃向〇〇藥房購得瓶裝胃牌藥品各三瓶，不料服後，病不减輕，反引起失眠及腹瀉之苦，心中大起疑寳，乃持空瓶向另一藥房詢問仔細，方始得知僞品，當然我心有不甘，向該出售僞藥的藥房交涉，不料他一片飾遁之辭，當購時有憑有據，自當據理交涉。鄙人受此欺騙之後，即復購得眞貨各兩盒，（槪裝鐵盒）。病始痊愈，想同病者殊多，恐有受欺，故懇請將此函登入　貴刊以揭破其黑幕，諒可允許。即頌撰安　陳立帆啓</p>
<p>月經停止</p>
<p>編者先生：女人的月經，關係康健很大，可是我兩月以來月經忽然停止，同時發現胸膈氣悶，心煩易怒，精神萎疲，人也瘦了不少，曾經醫師診斷，並非受孕，但服藥無效，請先生告我調經良方，幸甚，（白麗娟）</p>
<p>答：月經停止，純係內分泌生殖腺素衰弱所致，速服生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」立可調經强身。</p>
<p>胃痛難支</p>
<p>編者先生：人生最苦的是患胃痛，我就在胃痛的蹂躪下過生活，偶然多吃一些東西，都能惹起劇烈的疼痛，並且嘔吐酸水，受盡痛苦，請賜治療根斷辦法為感（錢均）</p>
<p>答：胃痛之特效藥，祗有「胃痛靈」可以勝任，同時再服「健胃素』輔助消化以强胃，即可根斷。</p>
<p>白帶何多</p>
<p>編者先生：俗語說：十女九帶，可見白帶本是很普遍的，我幾個朋友，差不多都有，可是我所患的就不同了，多而且膩，惡臭異常，請示治法（章慧玲）</p>
<p>答：白帶過多，此係體弱所致，除購外用藥「療帶靈」外再服『女用生殖素」增强體力短期可愈。</p>
<p>床幃隱病</p>
<p>先生：我倆結婚經年，因我發育不全兼有包皮，更使性器渺小，閨房之中毫無樂趣，請介紹治療名藥，不勝感謝，（周斌）</p>
<p>答：速就詹念曾醫師割除包皮，並內服「生殖素」以輔助發育，二月後必如常人之滿意樂趣。</p>

<h3>靑年為色慾衝動的　手淫弊害治療</h3>
<p>— 英國醫學博士楊家實</p>
<p>據多數醫學者研究所得！靑年中有百分之九十以上（大部分不知手淫弊害，），一達到適當年齡，就會犯手淫惡癖。關於靑年手淫問題，外國研究家有不少報告的。在日本近來，亦時常有靑年手淫的報告。</p>
<p>關於手淫的弊害，德國性病學者哈威愛羅克和英國著名的生理學家潑利斯氏有所證實，據彼等表示，手淫可使全身的發育受阻，神經衰弱，早洩，陰萎，精神不振等等弊害。原因由於手淫過度，精關受損，神志恍惚，夢交遺精難免。如遷延不戒，由遣精而滑精，情形就更險惡了。</p>
<p>靑年旣這樣如醉如在耽溺手淫，罔顧厲害。所以各國學者都在努力研究一種盡善盡美的根治法。</p>
<p>德國佈勒庫氏是全世界有名的性病醫生，據他統計因靑年犯手淫而罹遺精者，百人中倒有九十七人。最可靠的療法，是以鞏固精關，尅止遺精為最效，應服以「希米脫氏固精片」使遺精短期停止，同時再以「生殖素」根治因手淫而起的早洩，陰萎，及發育不全等症，此法行之三年，治愈的年以數十萬計，此誠為遺精靑年唯一對症良藥，當余在英倫皇家醫院研究時，每月時有被該藥根治而出院的男女，無可統計，故該藥之功效，巳遍見於各國，實無庸贅述也。我國靑年之有手淫癖者數不在少，故遺精異常普遍，欲恢復康健，捨此實無他途。</p>
<p>戒烟心得</p>
<h3>戒煙的利害問題</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>怎樣戒煙纔能安全而無痛苦　怎樣可避免疾病的侵襲牽累　這裏可明白告訴你戒絕方法</p>
<p>戒煙人的心理，在未戒之前，總希冀着能够一戒就絕，安全無恙，可是事實上那裏辦得到，要知道吸煙的人，差不多都由精神不佳或因疾病關係而吸，因之日久生癮，遂一日不可無此君了。假使一旦丟掉煙槍，精神即失了與奮的刺激，而因頓疲勞，有疾病的仍舊百病叢生，無疾病的更能引起各種疾病如神經衰弱，腎虧腰痠，遺精骨痛等，因了這些原因，故吸煙的人莫不視戒煙如畏途，因之戒而復吸的不知凡幾。</p>
<p>好了，現在科學萬能，上述的困難與痛苦，可用不到担心了，道就是現代最流行的培補戒煙法，因為人的吸煙，旣如上述的精神不佳，或疾病關係所致，這精神不佳或疾病的造成，純係內分泌生殖腺失了固有的健全，神經即趨萎疲，吸煙是因刺激神經而興奮，越使生殖腺蒙受損傷，所以培補戒煙法就為人推崇，投以大量生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以促進生殖腺之健康，育維賜保命增强體力，除毒斷癮，效騐最靈，余用此而戒除煙毒之吸者何止千萬，均達到勝利的成功，絕無絲毫的痛苦。</p>
<h3>具有尖銳勾引性的女子乳峯</h3>
<p>— 東南醫科大學畢業周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>歐美的女子每因乳癟求治而使美容院戶限為穿　月經不調發育不全認為是失去健美的重要因素　並有十九位女子前往割除處女膜可謂別開生面</p>
<p>不能否認，女子的健美完全與丰腴的臀部及高聳的乳峯發生密切的關連。女子的高聳乳峯，確含有最尖銳勾引能力和偉大的康健效果。面部的美，或姿態的美，都要藉飲食，運動，沐浴及有意義的科學保養而獲得，如不幸而喪失這種健美所必需的豐腴發育，那末除了用科學的方法補救之外，實在沒有更好的方法了。</p>
<p>面部的柔媚，和體態的健美，根本是在體素的堅强與活潑，而獲得這些健美表微之一個完全的方法，是在保持身體的適宜，內分泌的充足，新陳代謝的機能促進。一九三四年法國最著名的美容專家克拉夫啻愛畢格氏Krafft　Ebing說：用女用生殖腺素內分泌製劑可以治愈乳癟和臀部發育不美及皮膚枯燥，面無血色的女子，氏並證實曾以此法，治愈乳癟的女子二百十七人，面容蒼老的女子一百二十五人，月經不調的女子七百九十二人。後來一九三五年，英國的一位著名醫學博士阿曼得路斯氏Armand　Ronth與德國的一位美容專家馬克林氏Maclran曾合作在柏林開一摩登美容院，完全用女用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」治療不美的女子，十星期之內，曾有三千四百餘人前往求治，此三千四百餘人。中德國籍女子佔十分之七十，法國籍女子佔十分之一五，奧國及英美與日本都有，中國亦有二人前往診視，然均因乳癟而求高聳之法，據氏統計，月經不調佔十分之三二，共一千一百〇四人，乳癟的女子佔十分之一五，約八百六十三人，美容的佔十分之一七，的五百八十七人，並有十九位摩登女子前往割除處子膜云云，據說歐美女子對於貞操問題，並不以處女膜之有無為標準，因新婚時每因處女膜的堅靱難破增加不少的痛苦，故時有自動前往割除者，有的與未婚夫同往，故不以為奇。</p>
<p>『生殖素』對於美容上的成功，巳為各國著名學者公認的事實，科學萬能，信不誣也</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>淋病猖獗與傳佈的可怕</h3>
<p>— 英國醫學博士奧利生作　周笑涵醫師　節譯</p>
<p>據德國布利肯瑞治Breckenicge氏同懷提浩斯氏Whitehocuse二位花柳病醫生報告云：近來診察有花柳病嫌疑的男子五千七百四十三名，其中有三千九百三十八名確患淋濁。同時女子也有相當的數字，計患花柳病者共二千三百二十五人，其中患淋帶病者竟達一千二百十一人，可見女于患淋帶病之多，這些婦女，大都是娼妓之流，而男子大都傳自於浮浪不潔的賣淫女子。</p>
<p>這多數患有淋病的男女在三個月之中，完全治愈的達百分之八七，計四千九百九十六人，病勢减輕者佔百分之一三，計七百四十七人，彼唯一可靠的治法，完全以黃色素和伐克卒合製劑「安敵淋」內服，此外以洗滌法，注射劑為其補助治法。淋病一症向來視為難治，現在有此特效劑，至少總算向前進了一步。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>骨痛者之得失之途</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>最要緊認明治療之法，　有因治不得法而加劇，　有因對症而即離痛苦，　全在自己精密的選擇。</p>
<p>骨痛的治療，最為複雜而麻煩，偶一不愼，非但得不到治療的效果，反致加劇病患，故在選擇藥品治療之時，最宜精密謹愼，得失即在此時。</p>
<p>美國强斯登氏發明的「强斯登氏骨痛片」，為治療本症的唯一對症特效藥，無論因操勞過度的骨節痠痛，四肢痠麻，或因手淫房勞及花柳後之血份不潔，及瘋濕內蘊之瘋濕骨痛，腎部酸痛，關節炎痛，筋終牽痛等症，莫不一服見功，至多服四五瓶，無論各種痠麻骨痛，無不根斷，更能防止動脈硬化，腎臟炎，中風，尿毒等症狀之發生，故「强斯登氏骨痛片」實為骨痛者唯一救星</p>
<p>患者吳新陸，年三十六歲，曾因操勞過度並受風寒而患骨痛，壯年時復患過白濁，以故內部血份更不淸潔，瘋濕內藏，骨痛更烈，發作時痛澈心肺，週身痠痛得不能動彈，延醫服藥，皆不對症，反更加劇，經余以「强斯登氏骨痛片」治之，一瓶即見止痛，連服二月餘，四肢百骸，節節經鬆，無論天陰節氣，皆不覺痠痛，迄今五月未發云。</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>新章實行後收發報人値得注意的幾點（續前）</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>（五）新章適用之範圍　按照現行國內電報營業通則第一條之規定，凡中國境內往來之電報，雖於其傳遞之過程中曾經交由烟台大連水綫，或上海香港水綫，或天津瀋陽間陸綫，或國際電台及上海電報局直達無綫電路經轉者，均視為國內電報。故新章對於發往東北四省及香港澳門往來電報另有特定價目外，所有國內各處發往關外各處電報，不論經由烟大水綫或津瀋陸綫傳遞，均係一律按照國內電報價目計費，並不加收任何資費。</p>
<p>（六）關於鐵路經轉電報收報地名之書寫方法　凡發往未設電局而有車站地方之電報，祗須由發報人書明車站名稱作為收報地名，無須於地名之後贅以車站兩字，俾可减少收報地名之字數，以省報費。例如發往奔牛車站投送之電報，祗須書明「奔牛」二字作為收報地名，母庸書為「奔牛車站」也。</p>
<p>（七）報費總數之五厘尾數　現行國內電報價目表內規定之出省華文新聞電報價目為每字二分五厘，本省華文官電價目為每字三分五厘，因此新聞電及官電每電之報費總數往往帶有五厘尾數。例如發寄本省華文官電一通共計一百十五字，應付報費四元零二分五厘。惟各地現時大都尚未流行半分輔幣，故發報人對於上項五厘尾數除用銅元照電局規定之兌換價率繳付外，亦可用半分郵票代替，以資便利。</p>
<p>（八）郵轉及浙江省電話局代送電報之收報地名凡發往未設電報局而有郵局地方之郵轉華文電報及發往浙江省電話局代送之華文電報，其收報地名之前均須加註接轉該電之最近電局名稱，例如南京句容或諸曁義烏，上項地名，應按實有之字數連同收報人住址名稱之字數一併計算，以二字作一字計費。例如「南京句容東大街聚興祥」共有十字，應作五字計費。又依照國內電報營業通則第八十三條說明第（二）項之規定，各種洋文電報之收報地名曁收報人住址名稱，應一律按實有之字數計費。所有洋文郵轉電報之收報地名，例如Nanking　Kuyung，自應按二字計費也。</p>
<p>（九）納費公電補充或更正住址名稱各字之計費辦法發報人發出華文電報後，如因接到電局通知原電因收報人姓名住址欠詳及錯誤而無法投遞，欲請電局代發補充或更正收報人姓名住址之納費公電，所有補充或更正之住址名稱各字，自可適用新章，以二字作一字計費之規定。例如補充或更正住址四字，祗須繳付二字報費。</p>
<p>（十）關於電報收發處名稱　凡已在電報局名簿內載明投送釆報，並經規定呼號之電報收發處名稱，例如上海之吳淞，南京之下關，厦門之鼓浪嶼，均可由發報人書為「吳淞」「下關」「鼓浪嶼」，或用羅馬字拚為Shanghaiws，Nankingshn，Amoykls，作為收報地名，母庸加註上海，南京或厦門地名，以省地名字數。惟其他不送來報之電報收發處名稱，例如上海之曹家渡，西門界路等，祇可作為區名，仍須加註「上海」地名，以免錯誤。</p>
<p>（十一）較短之地名及簡稱地名　同一地方而有兩個名稱者，例如石家莊又名枕頭，發報人為减省收報地名之字數起見，對於發往石家莊等處之電報往往採用較短名稱，電局對於此項採用較短名稱作為收報地名之電報，雖可照收，但以該項地名業已刊入電報局名簿或曾經交通部核准者為限。惟此項較短名稱或為一般收報員所未熟諳，必須查閱電報局名簿後方可明瞭「枕頭」卽係石家莊」之別名，該電收下後勢必因翻查地名而耗費相當時間，不免稍受躭延，如因繕寫不淸而誤發他處，豈不損失更巨。且新章內規定，收報地名應連同收報人住址名稱字數一併計算，以二字作一字計費。倘該電之收報地名及收報人住址名稱，例如「石家莊大馬路新安旅社」共有十字，如不用「右家莊」而用「枕頭」亦有九字，照章均作五字計費，事實上並未節省報費，故發報人為避免錯誤及稽延起見，不如仍用正式地名為宜也。至渝，蓉，滬，漢等字為簡稱地名，其性質與上述之石家莊又名枕頭者不同，用於電文內固無不可，但不能書為收報地名，因此項簡稱地名僅有一字極易發生錯誤也。</p>
<h3>電報掛號移戶問題之解釋</h3>
<p>— 張維善</p>
<p>按電報掛號章程第十六條：「電報掛號不得轉讓他人，如須改換字樣或變更收報人姓名行號，均應另繳掛號費換取新照。」又第十八條：「期滿取消之掛號字樣，在斯滿後六個月內，其他收報人非得原掛號戶書面同意者，不得用以掛號。」上項規定，為避免誤收電報？並尊重收報人權益而定者也。近來商行要求更改字號者甚多，亦有商店已經到閉，而另開同一性質之新商號，想將掛號保留以資熟識者。此種情事，在請求人，以為無大關係，可以隨便借用，但電局必須照章辦理。因為一種章程之釐訂，當然根據已往之事實，其着重點，還在尊重發報人之權利。本來電報局對於不續掛之電報，原可不必照送，因為旣未盡納費掛號之義務，當然不能享受掛號省費之權利，掛號期滿保留六個月內者，電局已盡優待之能事。</p>
<p>嘗見許多商號，將電報掛號字樣，印在信紙賬單或信封上者，因其來報無多，為省費起見，不續掛號。電局倘使即將此項字樣另掛新戶，如老戶偶然來張電報，就不能分曉此係誰家電報？貽誤事機，莫此為甚！電局為補救此種弊病起見，所以代為保留六個月，以期服務之周密。</p>
<p>一張電報送錯，不僅延誤收報人之事，誤收之人也會發生誤會，所以轉讓掛號一節，在新舊商戶之間，均須愼重考慮。</p>
<p>此外關於掛號之點，尚須申述者如下：（一）掛號滿期，商行應如期續掛，否則不但補費麻煩，誤會在所不免。（二）掛號字碼，不必選定一個字，比如「德」字，當然好記，可是「一七九五」數碼，却不容易記。而「一二三四」數碼，比任何普通字好記，所以與其選字，反不如選一個好記之數碼。（三）尚有商行未曾來局掛號，巳將掛號字碼印在信紙上，或竟發電通知對方，待到電局去掛號，方知該字碼，已有人掛去，電局遇有此項來電，勢必將電報送給已經掛號之人，俟其拒收後，才有機會領取，所以在掛號手續未辦以前，最好不必先事宣揚。（四）依照以前掛號章程，掛號戶要遷移住址者，應將憑照送交報局更改住址。現為便利發報人起見，依照新章，祗要　函知電局卽可，但須將掛號字樣書寫，否則掛號底冊，無從改正，以致電報不得不仍照原址投送，多費周折，延誤事機，電局不能負責。以上數點，應請掛號各戶注意者也。</p>
<h3>交部主辦之長途電話業務兩種新猷</h3>
<p>查京漢等處電話局，營業區域遼闊，開放長途來話傳呼通知後，對於距離話局較遠之受話人，若一一由話局派差傳呼，來局通話，則信差往返需時，話務必多稽延。為謀迅速起見，訂定「長途電話來話傳呼須知，」由各電報收發處協同辦理該項通話業務。又查市內代辦長途電話之各電報收發處之營業時間，頗不一致，為便利發話人通話起見，規定「電報收發處代辦長途電話移轉辦法」一種，以資遵守。茲將兩項辦法之要點，申述如下：</p>
<p>甲，關於長途電話來話傳呼者</p>
<p>長途台接到來話傳呼通知後，卽按照發話局所報地址，就地圖上查明所劃區域內之電報收發處，由電話通知該收發處，告以傳呼種類，原來號數，來話地點，及受話人之地址，門牌號數，姓名，時分等項。電報收發處卽按照上述各項，分別塡寫於「長途電話來話通知單」上，並加蓋戳記等手續畢，隨時派差按址投送。</p>
<p>派差傳送後，如因（一）受話人地址不明無從傳達者，（二）或經傳達後受話人不來接話者，隨時須由經送報差或收發處，用電話通知長途台，以憑通知發話局，作「納費銷號」取銷該次之通話。</p>
<p>自傳知後，受話人聲明準卽到某處答話者，始將通知單交付受話人塡經送到時刻並簽字蓋章後，報差將其下聯收據帶回收發處。</p>
<p>受話人持有此項通知單，到原收發處或就近收發處答話時，收發處人員經騐明單上所蓋戳記及經手人簽字無訛後，卽用電話通知長途台，告知本收發處之電話號碼，及答話人姓名，已來接話，掛上聽筒，靜候通話。</p>
<p>乙，關於電報收發處代辦長途電話移轉者</p>
<p>凡附設各郵局內之電報收發處在辦公鐘點終了時，如有代辦長途電話已經掛號，尚未通話者，得與話局長途台接洽移轉至指定之附近電報收發處（以二十四小時工作者為限）通話。在移轉電話時，應將預塡收費憑據收回註銷，並於憑據存根借話欄內，註明「移轉〇〇〇收發處」字樣，以便查考。另塡給發話人「移轉長途電話通知單」一紙，以憑持向指定之收發處通話，其預收話費，暫存該處，留待指定通話之收發處翌日持單兗取。</p>
<p>發話人經指定在附近某收發處通話時，應卽持通知單前往守候，不得中途逗留，亦不得藉詞拒絕。</p>
<p>指定通話之收發處，接到移轉長途電話通知單時，應立卽用電話通知電話局長途台，告知發話人已到達該處，以便接綫通話，並將移轉電話通知單，視作現金留存該處，俟發話人通話完畢後，按照其應付話費數目，多退少補，另塡正式收費憑據，交給發話人，作為該處之收入。</p>
<h3>最近完成之電信建設</h3>
<p>甲，關於電報綫路部份</p>
<p>（一）建設省際電報綫路</p>
<p>交通部為謀省際通信之便利起見，對於相鄰省區邊境電報局而無綫路聯絡者，均建設新綫路，以免報務之週轉。八月份中完成者，有關係豫皖省際通信周家口至毫縣工程中，豫省綫路，計長一百零八公里。關係蘇皖省際通信衆興至泗縣工程中，皖省綫路，計長六十六公里。曁關係浙閩省際通信之廣豐至浦城綫路，計長九十八公里。</p>
<p>（二）貴陽至關嶺及赤水渡修綫</p>
<p>貴陽關嶺間及貴陽經　節至赤水淺之電報桿綫，年久失修，茲由貴州電政管理局，加以修整，並各加掛一綫，前者長二百十九公里，後者長二百五十七公里。</p>
<p>（三）孝感至老河口及巴東至恩施修綫</p>
<p>孝感至老河口電報綫路，計長四百七十八公里，巴東至恩施電報綫路，計長二百十一公里，關係鄂省西北西南一帶之電信交通，至為重要。交通部特飭由湖北電政管理局派員分別修整，俾資通暢，並於巴恩綫全體加掛一綫，孝老綫樊城至老河口一段，亦加掛一綫。</p>
<p>乙，關於長途話綫部份</p>
<p>（一）夾江至嘉定綫</p>
<p>查川省自成都至峨嵋，曾建設長途話綫一對，距峨嵋不遠之夾江，南迤卽為嘉定，該處為川省重埠，商業繁盛，成都嘉定間通信，極為繁要。交通部卽建設夾江至嘉定話綫一對，雖僅長四十七公里、，而建設完成後，原有成峨話餞，卽可充分利用。</p>
<p>（二）吉安至贛縣綫</p>
<p>吉安贛縣同為贛南重地，自匪亂平靖後，繁榮可期。交通部特派員分段架設長途話綫一對，自泰和以下，卽加掛於原有報桿上，泰和以上，另設新桿木，訐長二百三十公里。茲已全部竣工，開始營業，並與原有南昌吉安長途綫聯絡通話。</p>
<p>（三）京漢綫帮電設備</p>
<p>京漢長途電話，原係九省長途電話網計劃中五大幹綫之一，其設綫工程，已於本年六月份完成，當以京漢距離遙遠，而中間局帮電設備，尚未裝竣，一時不能開放直達通話，遂先在沿經重要城市間局部開放通話，一面並與京銅，蕪屯，九南諸綫。就通話聲音有效距離範圍以內，試騐聯絡通話。現在京漢間之九江殷家匯兩處帮電機，業已裝竣，京漢直達通話，遂於九月一日正式開放商用。</p>
<p>交通部新添長途電話營業各處及增加通話地點各處（七八兩月份）</p>

<h3>宋元理學述略</h3>
<p>— 吳承仕</p>
<p>序譚丕模著「宋元明思想史網」</p>
<p>舊同學譚丕模君，多年從事於宋元明理學研究的工作，現在把他的心得寫成一本名為「宋元明思想史網」的小册子，要我作序。我覺得在所謂「太極河洛天人理氣」的模胡影響的王國裏，能够用哲學的立塲，歷史的方法，去發現牠的眞實：是一種有意義的嘗試和有效能的創作；雖然用新觀點去研究舊歷史的幷不創始於譚君此書。</p>
<p>找對於宋元理學，素無修養和認識；祗能把粗疏的直觀所得，略陳於下方。同意的可作為補充，不同意的可作為貢獻：</p>
<p>陸子靜說：「東海有聖人出，此心司，此理同；西海南海北海有聖人出，此心同，此理同。千百世之上有聖人出，此心同，此理同；千百世之下有聖人出，此心同，此理同。」「心」是思維，「理」是思維的範　或路線。但是，思維是决定於存在的。假使物質的基礎——存在——不同，那反映出的心理，當然不同；不必說東西海千百年，就是同時同地的人，「理」也幾乎不能相喻。子靜的老兄子美說：「治家「不問」貧富「皆當」取九年熟必有三年蓄之法，以所人留十之二三，毋毀所蓄以壞「定規」，家不至廢而身不至有非理之求。」我想：一箇衣租食稅的世襲地主——陸氏是大地主，不能想像赤貧者瀕於飢餓線的悲哀，正和一箇無產者，不能想像豪紳所謂「皆當」「必有」「定規等等的說敎，是同樣的眞實：這足以證明陸氏兄弟的觀念論的階級性，同時也證明了「心同理同」這半截公式，不能作為比附援引的護身符</p>
<p>有人說：「易經的『乾』即是阿賴邪識，為萬法緣起，故曰『資始』，恒轉如瀑流，故曰『行建；『坤』即末那識，末那執我，故日『得主』，恒審思量，故日『有常』。同時也可以說：「『有天地然後有萬物，有萬物然後有男女，有男女然後有夫婦，有夫婦然後有父子，有父子然後有君臣，有君臣然後有上下，有上下然後禮義有所錯。』即是說：先有太陽系和地球而後才有動植物，而後才有兩腿直立的人類，而後才由雜交進到固定婚姻，而後才由母系進到父系的家族，而後才有封建的國家和階層的領主和農奴，而後才建立好些『道德』『法律』等支配工具」。可是佛家的大乘，是從婆羅門勝論數論轉來的，唯物論辯證法，是從費爾巴哈黑格爾等轉來的；同時也是適應於牠們的社會基礎而發生發展的。誰敢全稱肯定說。。易傳的一切環境，和唯識論辯證法的環境完全相同呢？所以我們應該把那「心同理同」的上半截公式，建築在社會基礎的「存在」上面，才可拿來作為批判哲學的基準。否則只是「概念的游戲」而已</p>
<p>我們應該從歷史上分析具體事實，從哲畢上把握正確觀點；更困難的是：在支配者一手包辦的記載中，去「伐毛洗髓」幷「披沙揀金」，才能得到建設的材料。當然，我們要克服道種困難，幷且正確利用這些材料，不要隨牠「散錢滿地」而沒有一條繩子來穿牠。</p>
<p>從別一方面觀察，宋元理學是比漢學進步些，雖然他們同樣是觀念論者：鄭康成說：「天帝有六：五方五色帝而外，尚有天皇大帝——北極燿魄寶。」鄭注中庸「天命之謂性」云：「木神則仁，火神則禮，金神則義，水神則智，土神則信。」他說仁義等是性，木火等是天，天一面是自然，一面是人格，同時又是空中的星座，同時又都有名有姓：這是多末幼稚素樸神秘多元的戲論啊！一到宋儒，他要求有一箇統一的世界觀和絕望的眞理觀。所以把五行統於陰陽，再把陰陽統於太極；猶以為未足，太極之上又加無極：將中庸和易經混合起來作為整箇的哲學體系。假如問漢儒，「太極是甚麽？」也許回答你，「是北辰，」再問「北辰是甚麽」？也許回答你「北辰名呌耀魄寶。若宋儒就高明多了，他設：一太極者究竟至極無名可名之謂也：」只將這點作比較，也可證明牠由較低階段發展至較高階段的歷史過程。</p>
<p>宋儒的修養，本竊自禪宗的「打坐」和「看活頭，」他的宇宙觀所謂「太極先天河圖洛書，」本傳自陳希夷。前者是周程張朱以至陸王等所通用的；後者那些圈圈點點方圓黑白種種玩意兒，只有朱晦菴大張旗鼓的宣傳提倡。因為道士傳下來的太極圖，加上五行的成分，竟把朱子攪得頭昏眼花，到晚年還鑽到注「參同契」看風水的牛角尖裏去。但是他們在倫理的所謂「三綱」方面，意識的或非意識的都盡了很大的義務。尤其是朱子努力最大，黨徒最多，著作最富，又將神秘的太極圖載在「性理」書的頭上，證明「道之大原出天；」其實却變成心猿孫行者頭上一道緊箍咒。當時的聖明天子，正好互相利用，於是四書小學近思錄啓蒙本義等書，竟統治了六百餘年的科舉王國。除掉少數激烈分子是從沒有覬覦非分的了。</p>
<p>然而歷史的「存在」，終究是要進展的，所以學術也不得不隨之而進步。即就方法論的考據方面看，也可窺見一斑：</p>
<p>當時與朱學對抗的，一方是心學的金谿派，一方是經制之學的永嘉派。朱氏篤信「無極而太極，」陸象山即面紅耳赤的力爭「無極」二字不見於經傳，葉正則更根本否認「太極」二字是孔子之言。可是陸葉等的考據功夫，幷沒有以「道問學」自命的朱氏那末結實，所以終竟不能損其毫末。</p>
<p>司馬君實歐陽永叔葉正則袁機仲林黃中等都不信河洛，朱氏最後而且唯一的辯護武器，祗有「無奈顧命繫辭論語皆有是言」這一句。可是要知道：顧命繫辭論語固然有河圖洛書之說，但幷沒有說河圖是五十五箇圈子，洛書是四十五箇圈子！</p>
<p>朱氏疑心梅氏尚書是假的，誠然是驚人的發見。可是他建設「道統，」又不能不把「危微精一」「以義制事以禮制心」「善無常主協於克一」等格言，認為聖聖相傳的心印。不知「人心道心，」是出於「道統」以外主張性惡的荀子，「制心協一，」是出於不足齒數的王肅鄭冲之流</p>
<p>一到淸初，黃太冲兄弟閻百詩胡朏明惠定宇等，用精密的分析，廣博的立證，將河圖洛書先天後天無極太極惟精惟一一切根本基礎，打得東倒西歪。兪理初很輕薄的說：「陳搏無機心，無是非，確見其人半明半昧如太極圖。」經過種種嚴重打擊，王國於是乎崩潰，道統於是乎瓦解了。我們知道：哲學是跟着自然科學和科學方法的進化而進化的：淸儒蘇州派的打倒宋學，和徽州派用「求是不求古」的口號打倒漢學或宋學，這，或許是新興哲學將要發揮光大的曙光吧！</p>
<p>雜亂無章的寫了如上一番話，以復於譚君。幷希望他不斷努力完成此種偉大工作。</p>
<h3>夏丐尊先生和「平屋雜文」</h3>
<p>— 何似</p>
<p>「平屋雜文」開明書店出版　每册四角五分</p>
<p>認識夏巧尊先生的人很多，知道他的自然益發多了——雖然談到他時，甚至寫信給他時，照例把「丐尊」寫成丐尊」。我所知道他的，並不比一般人多了什麽，僅僅能够弄淸楚「丐」與「丐」而巳。</p>
<p>他的對於日本文學的翻譯，從量的方面講並不多；從質的方面講，在中國新文學運動興起以後，也曾經是幾個可信託的譯者中的一個。許多知道他的人，大概也從這方面知名的。可是他自己一向就沒有標榜過是「文人」，好像也沒有想成為作家的金圖。他自己寫的文字那麽少，在各方面很少有使人了解的機會。所以儘管有着許多知道他的人，而實在了解他的，怕只是和他有實際往來的寥寥的幾個朋友而已</p>
<p>今年一月間，他把所寫的文字收集了一部分，用着「平屋雜文的書名出版。我是因為想多了解一點他的生活和思想的那種心情，把它來讀了的。</p>
<p>這誠然是一個雜文集，評論，小說，隨筆，各種性質的文字都有。但是不管文字的性質怎樣，而內容所寫述的，除出一部分時事評論外，幾乎全是作者自己身世的感念和對於生活的體騐。誠如朱佩弦先生給他的信里、（見第七期本刊）所說，「如少年時的回憶，中年時的惆悵。……說理的文字自然也是經騐之談。」</p>
<p>不等你讀完這個集子，你就會分明地感覺到，有一種「一貫的精神」流注在這裏邊。那就是作者情感的眞摯，態度的坦白，文字的樸素洗鍊，和他所寫述着的生活體騐的親切，使你衷心地感受了它。自然，這種「一貫的精神」是每個作者都應具備的；不過像寫「平屋雜文」那種自我表現的文字，難得多少觀察」和「想像」的帮助，益發覺得這種精神的重要。</p>
<p>因為「平屋雜文」是作者生活和思想的眞切的記錄，所以像我這樣想多知道他一點的讀者，會感得分外的滿足的。當然，文藝的欣賞，也不會讓你輕易地忽略過去的。</p>
<p>至於在道三十三篇文字中，指出什麽，什麽幾篇，說是說明作者生活的；指出什麽，什麽幾篇，說是說明作者思想的；或竟摘引原文若干段，作為例證：我想都是不必要的。因為別的「平屋雜文」的讀者，也許所得比我更多些！</p>
<h3>「西洋名畫巡禮」</h3>
<p>— 士佼</p>
<p>豐子愷著—九角—開明書店出版</p>
<p>你想知道一些美術的基本知識嗎？你想讀到一本淺近而完備的美術史嗎？你願意讀一些名畫家的傳記嗎？或者你愛聽許多有趣的美術故事嗎？那麽，我要介紹道本「西洋名晝巡禮」給你，使你滿足這些慾望。</p>
<p>凡是讀過豐子愷先生文章的人，誰都喜歡他那親切·柔和·雋永·富有詩意的語調，和那趣味的結構。他的小品文如此，他的藝術理論文字也是如此，道就是本書的第一個特點。</p>
<p>如果把這本書比做一個炮仗，那麽，書中名畫的鑑賞可說是導火線，各畫的作者傳記和軼事是火藥，而給與讀者的對於美術的學習鑑賞理解等知識，就是那宏大而淸晰的爆聲了。</p>
<p>書中共載名畫二十四幅，是二十二位大畫家的代表作。有的光怪陸離，有的淸淡幽雅，有的秀麗細緻，有的雄偉粗壯。把四百年來，美術變遷的情形，瞭然揭示出來。</p>
<p>講話十二篇，每篇都至少有一個極美麗動人的故事。其中引人發笑的，如「一個銅板的晝家官司」中，說一個英國著名的學問家拉斯金（Ruskin）因為批評當時的美國印象派畫家輝斯勒（J．A．Whistler）的畫「是把顏料瓶倒翻在晝布上了給大家看」，便被輝斯勒向法庭起訴，結果法官判拉斯金拿出一個銅板的罰金。又如「自己割了耳朶的畫家」說一位荷蘭的痴畫家谷訶（V.V.Gogh）的種種可笑的軼事，也很有趣。其中能够使人感動流淚的，如「貧乏的大畫家」中，寫近代法國畫家米葉（Mille）的種種貧困情形：他為了要實行祖母臨終時吩咐他的「為永遠而描寫」，竟不管當時人們喜歡裸體女人和王侯貴人的畫的心理，而儘力去做人所厭棄的含有大衆價値的畫，結果，他竟被貧困顚倒了一生。其中又有使人感到離奇的，如「富貴的美術家」中，寫近代西洋畫祖師，法國古典派畫家達微特（L．David）一生命運變幻的不測，竟像一篇童話了。</p>
<p>每篇講話中都連帶述及許多關於美術上的種種知識，非常詳明，叙述的生動有趣，正不减於那些美麗的故事。例如他在講到鑑賞圖畫的方法時，他這樣地說：</p>
<p>我們靜靜地坐在畫的面前，使畫面上的形象照到我們的眼中，便「覺得」畫的布置。遠近。明暗，都非常美妙，好比吃一杯新鮮的牛乳：又肥·又鮮·又甜·又香·但倘有人問你這滋味到底怎樣，你就說不出來，你只能請他自己吃一杯看。看整也是這樣的…（第二十二頁）</p>
<p>又如他為了要解釋特拉克洛亞的「市街戰」，就把整個法國革命的歷史，寫成一個極簡短有趣的故事，也很難得。全書講到繪畫的方法加色粉筆畫·木炭畫·寫生畫·水彩畫·人體寫生·透視·調色·光·位置的安排·中國畫和油畫的比較·畫派的論斷等，都很詳細。第十二講的新興藝術。賞」，總述上面各講並加以正確的批評，和給於讀者親切的指示，使他們能够藉此得到一條研究美術的途徑，更可珍貴。</p>
<p>藝術是人生樂趣的要素，是養成偉大的胸懷的原子。我們雖然不能希望每人都能够成功一個藝術家，但至少不能不對於它有着相當的認識，因此，我以至誠介紹這本最能使人興起閱讀興趣的「西洋名畫巡禮」，貢獻給一般預備前進的靑年們。</p>
<h3>讀「朗誦法」後</h3>
<p>— 曹揆百</p>
<p>一，題外的話</p>
<p>從綠衣人手裏接到「朗誦法」時，恰巧有二個同學在旁邊，A君未經我的允許，巳先搶去看了。滿想他們這麽倉着看，定是對於這書有特別的愛好和興味，决不是新出版或新寄到的緣故。不料A君僅看了看面上的書名，就往B君手裏扔！</p>
<p>「你還去學一般老學究的死法則，買這種書來做什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>我本想有充分的理由告訴他，B君巳把它翻了兩翻，不自然地遞給了我：</p>
<p>「或許還沒明白書的內容，所以買了來——這種書，不過輾轉抄集一些古文學家的讀書方法罷了！跟「古今讀書法」那樣的東西有什麽不同？」</p>
<p>他們倆都不滿意這本書。但我對於他們的態度不敢贊同，因為他們先自犯了下面的二個錯誤：</p>
<p>一·在沒有看淸書的內容之前，决不可妄加批評。</p>
<p>二，不能以一已愛憎，作為批評的標準。</p>
<p>在買道本朗誦法前，已有二個問題糾纏着我，不得不去研究朗誦法：第一個問題，為什麽中學國文程度日漸低落？一定有學習上不得其法的地方在。第二個問題，是一般敎育家，或國文敎員所提倡的閱讀，除不妨礙他人自修，適合團體生活外，對於我們國文程度的進步上有什麽效益？因為有道兩個問題在心中，自幼沒學過朗誦法的我，便毅然一讀這本同學們認為落伍的科學——「朗誦法」了。</p>
<p>用了一個星期日的下午，讀完這本朗誦法。不覺使我「啊！」地驚呼起來，這非但不是落伍的科學，簡直是現代研究文學的重要著述，研究國文的良好指針。它不但告訴了我們自修，創作的經騐，並且在結論裏替我們這些陷在國文程度低落裏的學生，向一般國文導師說；「吾人苟欲增進今日學生之國文程度，激發其愛好本國文學的興味，補救其貧乏枯窘，實非提倡朗誦法不為功。」（第一五〇頁）</p>
<p>二，讀書方法的檢討</p>
<p>靑年沒有讀書經騐，往往誤認一般人的所謂「多閱」「略閱」為讀書的最好方法。約略多看了幾本書，就自詡謂「博覽羣書。」結果對於書的描寫技術，含意，幽默，都沒有領悟的機會，朗誦法的緒論裏就有這樣惋惜的話：「偉大作品之値得記憶成誦者，僅以一講一看而了之。」接下就引了朱子的意見：『大抵觀書，先須熟讀，使其言皆出於吾之口，繼以精思，使其意皆出於吾之心，然後可有得爾。」此眞可謂為讀書有得，體貼人微之妙語』（第五頁）讀書是要做到這一點，而能「口誦心維，」那末可以感到「讀書之樂樂無窮。一</p>
<p>緒論中又說：「今人之祇知看而不重讀，或讀之而不得其中神味與妙旨者，皆不免於「望城而止」之譏耳』（第六頁）道實是極力矯正我們偏重「多閱」「略閱」之錯誤，及因無導師指導，即讀也不得法。可見這朗誦法是想提高我們國文程度，指導我們讀書方法而產生的。</p>
<p>朗誦法雖是鼓吹「朗誦主義」的，然對涉獵的閱讀，並不因此而看輕。其中有一句話：「看與讀眞是兩種工夫」（第六頁）質言之，就是「閱與讀，兩者缺一不可。」但要做到蔡元培先生所說的：「食肉者窠其骨，食果者棄其核，未有渾淪而吞之者也」（文明之消化）的讀書，當然要推崇朗誦的讀法。</p>
<p>不過可以朗誦的書籍也有限，如要每篇偉大的作品都成誦，在精力方面無論怎樣是不可能的。在作者黃先生也巳看到這一點，所以說：『崑山方唯一先生詩文淸雋卓拔，一代名家，自謂：「胸中爛熟，而可背誦如流者，不過百篇而已』（結論第一四七頁）</p>
<p>最後說到背誦的方法，這自然是朗誦的最後目的：「悟性之推進與記憶之鍜鍊，相關至為密切。故凡了解愈透徹之文字，亦愈易記憶成誦。」這句話是現在朗誦法的新意見，新理論，一掃從前一般私塾裏的强誦强記的死讀書方法。所以我們要記住：我們的朗誦法是活的，能動的。</p>
<p>三，創作的必要條件</p>
<p>朗誦法不但明白的告訴了我們讀書方法，它並且直接的告訴了我們創作的方法。我的讀書，和我的創作都是犯了朗誦法第七頁緒論所謂：「近人所作語體散文與詩歌大都不可卒讀。或竟未經吟哦，推敲，一揮寫就，逕以付印。購閱者亦祇求其新奇，快意，不暇計及其修辭。於是新作家競於立意，運思，繪色，寫景，叙人，記事各點用力甚勤，而忽於詩文之銀鍊字句……」的毛病。雖有好的寫作材料，往往因缺乏字句鍜鍊，不能極體貼的表達出來。卽使表達出來，也因沒有推敲，吟詠的琢磨，缺點連自己都不知道。因此我們的創作要做到</p>
<p>「吾人創作無論為文言語體，韻句或散文，脫稿時，如能朗誦一過，必立卽發現其選字不精，造句未妥，音節失諧，聲調有誤，種種不洽意處；於是重複朗誦，屢加修改，至於心安理得而後止。」（緒論第九頁）</p>
<p>我想，創作時能够做到這一點，已够了。</p>
<p>朗誦法的是好是壞，草率讀了一遍的我，不敢就下批評。這裏不過報告我讀後的一點心得。　得每個讀者自己去發現。</p>

<h3>Paying Attention to the Tokyo Area: When Will Chairman Chiang Return to Nanjing? Believing that There is No Progress in the Sino-Japanese Situation, Hoping that Chiang Will Meet with Kawagoe, The Nanjing Side Sends Zhang Qun and Kawagoe to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) All eyes here are focused on when Chairman Chiang will return to Nanjing. According to general observations, if Chairman Chiang and Ambassador Kawagoe can meet, then even if the future is full of thorns, the current stalemate can ultimately be alleviated to some extent. Japanese newspapers attach great importance to the military leaders' meeting of the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army, and they all publish it in a prominent position. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that there has been no progress in the Sino-Japanese situation since it deteriorated, and strongly stated that although a deadline has not yet been set, tolerance has almost reached its limit. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Exercises in the Suburbs of Beiping: Frequent Military Maneuvers Between Beiping and Fengtai</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, there were machine gun sounds in Beiping City, which were emitted by Japanese soldiers during exercises in the suburbs.

<h3>China's Important Role as a League of Nations Councilor</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>In this session of the League of Nations General Assembly, the issue most relevant to us is the increase in the number of non-permanent councilors of the Executive Yuan, with China obtaining a seat. According to foreign news reports, the First Committee, the Legal and Regulatory Committee, of the League of Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 24th of last month to discuss this issue. A resolution was passed recommending to the General Assembly that the number of non-permanent councilors of the Executive Yuan be increased from nine to eleven, with one seat given to China and the other retained by Portugal. Although the League of Nations General Assembly has not yet passed the report of the First Committee, according to past practice, the General Assembly will not fail to pass the recommendations of the committee. Therefore, from this session of the League of Nations General Assembly onwards, China will again obtain a seat as a non-permanent councilor in the Palace of Peace in Geneva.</p>
<p>China is the first major country in Asia and the strongest supporter of the League of Nations. However, the League of Nations has paid too little attention to our position in the Far East. In the past ten years, China has been elected as a non-permanent councilor of the Executive Yuan only three times, and has failed to win the election or request re-election three times. The last failure was in 1934, when the aggressor in the Far East announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. There was no representative of an Asian country in the Executive Yuan. At that time, China requested re-election, believing that it would definitely have a chance of being elected. However, the limited number of councilors of the League of Nations had already been allocated to several countries in each continent, so China did not even get the chance to be re-elected. Since this election failure, we have changed our approach and raised the issue of increasing the number of councilors at last year's League of Nations General Assembly. The Executive Yuan then decided to form a councilor allocation committee to study the issue. This committee decided in April to recommend to the Executive Yuan that the number of councilors be increased by two, with one seat held by China. The Executive Yuan Standing Committee in May passed the motion as usual. It has now been submitted to the General Assembly for approval. After years of arduous struggle, our goal has finally been achieved.</p>
<p>China should occupy an important position in the Executive Yuan for very good reasons. As Dr. Wellington Koo said, "Since 1934, there has been no representative of an Asian country in the Executive Yuan. However, the Executive Yuan should be based on the principle of all-encompassing. The events that occur in Asia can have an impact on the whole world. The Executive Yuan should directly obtain information. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and its population is the largest in the world. Its cooperation with the League of Nations has been extremely close from the beginning. It is very suitable to represent Asia." (Speech in the First Committee on the 24th).</p>
<p>But what benefits will this result, which we have achieved through such hard work, bring to China? On this point, we can explain it from the change in the nature of the League of Nations. In the past, the League of Nations was a group of powerful imperialists. But in recent years, due to the withdrawal of the most aggressive imperialist countries and the accession of peace-loving countries (such as the Soviet Union and Turkey), the League of Nations has become more of a peace-keeping organization. China is the country in the world that most strongly supports peace. Now it can cooperate closely with international peace organizations, which is of great importance to the future of world peace. At the same time, it also has a great impact on our work of opposing aggression and supporting peace. But this does not mean that we can rely on the League of Nations and not struggle ourselves. If we think this way, we will not only step on the wrong path of the past and head towards the path of destruction, but also weaken the power of the League of Nations. Because the League of Nations itself has no power. Its power is entirely based on the member states. The so-called power of the member states is to support peace and resist aggression. Therefore, after we are elected as a councilor of the Executive Yuan, we must not only not have the heart to rely on others, but also use our own power to resist aggression to enrich the power of the League of Nations. Because the strength of the League of Nations is actually the greatest blow to the aggressive imperialists.</p>

<p>(London) At yesterday's meeting of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War, the representatives of Italy and Russia had a major disagreement. The committee had to announce a postponement and will continue the meeting in the middle of next week. The reason is that the Italian representative insisted on discussing the reservations proposed by his country (the Italian reservations called for all countries concerned to stop the public from donating money and aiding and abetting volunteers for both sides of the Spanish conflict). Although the representatives of other countries have all reserved their attitude on the content of this issue, they have also accepted to discuss it.

<h3>League of Nations Continues General Debate; Little Entente Clarifies Position; Opposes Revision of the Covenant; Implementation Must Be Thoroughly Reformed; Mysterious Declaration by the Argentine Representative</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly continued the general political debate this afternoon. After the Chinese representative Gu Weijun delivered a speech, the Czech Foreign Minister Krofta took the floor and explained the position of the Little Entente countries on the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. He said that although there have been many incidents in the past year, the policy adopted by the Little Entente countries is still based on the League of Nations and has not changed. The common claims of the Little Entente countries are as follows: (1) The League of Nations should concentrate all its efforts to limit armaments. (2) There is no need to revise the League of Nations Covenant, but the League of Nations should revise the implementation of the basic provisions of the Covenant based on past experience, especially the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant. Article 16 should be supplemented by regional agreements because all countries are unwilling to provide military assistance for events that are not directly related to their own interests. (3) The Little Entente countries' views on Article 19 of the Covenant (i.e., regarding the revision of treaties) have always been the same, that is, the revision of treaties must be freely permitted by all parties to the signing. The Little Entente countries are now prepared to cooperate with the League of Nations on various steps to enhance the effectiveness of the Covenant and the League of Nations. All measures that weaken the League of Nations and the Covenant are opposed by the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>Next, the Australian representative Bruce, the Indian representative Aga Khan, and the New Zealand representative Jordaan successively delivered speeches. The meeting was adjourned at 6 pm. When the General Assembly continues its meeting tomorrow, the speakers scheduled to speak are the Abyssinian representative and the Portuguese representative Monteiro.

<h3>Ardent Speech of the Argentine Representative: Ready for Great Sacrifices to Protect National Rights</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly today continued the general debate on political issues. The Abyssinian representative, Dache Chez, first delivered an ardent speech, stating that the Abyssinian emperor is now ready "to make great sacrifices" to protect the lives of the people and to defend the independent rights of the Abyssinian nation. (After this statement was made, there were rumors that the Abyssinian emperor was abdicating.) Or it is said that the Italian-Abyssinian issue has come to an end. In fact, the decision made by this session of the League of Nations General Assembly (referring to allowing the Abyssinian delegation to attend, thereby recognizing Abyssinia as still a member of the League of Nations) is by no means the end of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, if our country's borders are blockaded, and all countries still prohibit the transportation of military supplies to our country, so that we lack the tools of defense, how can we expect it to be effective even if we continue to resist the enemy? In addition, Italy's cruelty is extreme, even using poisonous gas to achieve its aggressive ambitions. How many countries are militarily stronger than our country, and if they have also suffered this kind of aggression, would they not be defeated by it? My emperor was previously allowed by the government of his country to go to Europe in order to personally file a complaint with the League of Nations. The League of Nations should now take decisive action, not hesitate and wait, so that the aggressor can benefit from it. As for the member states, it is fortunate that they should take what our country has experienced as a warning. As far as the League of Nations Covenant is concerned, its wording is clear and practical, and there is no need to revise it. However, based on experience, its implementation must always be thoroughly reformed. Otherwise, it is difficult to expect the Covenant to be effective. "After the Abyssinian representative finished speaking, the Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro took the floor and said that Portugal is maintaining neutrality on the Spanish issue. He then mentioned the League of Nations Covenant and said that it must be strengthened. Afterwards, Argentine representative Cantillo and Haitian representative Mayard successively delivered speeches, and Chairman Lemas immediately announced the adjournment. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the Abyssinian king has expressed that if the Italian side can recognize the government that Abyssinia currently governs in the un-occupied areas, he would also be willing to recognize the part of the Abyssinian territory that Italy has already conquered. From this, it can be clearly understood the mysterious declaration made by the Abyssinian representative Tai Chai Porcelain at the League of Nations General Assembly, because Tai Chai mentioned that Italy is now planning to attack the various ethnic groups that are still expressing opposition. In order to avoid sacrificing lives and to maintain an independent country for his people, the Abyssinian king believes that it is necessary to sacrifice the League of Nations' guarantee of his rights. After the declaration was made, the general public initially thought that the Abyssinian king's abdication was still pending, but later it became clear that the Abyssinian king was immediately prepared to contact Italy. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian King Not Intending to Abdicate: Declaration by the Abyssinian Ambassador in London</h3>
<p>(London) When the Abyssinian representative Dache Chez gave a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly today, he had a phrase that the Abyssinian emperor was prepared to make great sacrifices. The outside world made various speculations, saying that the Abyssinian emperor intended to abdicate. The Abyssinian Embassy in the United Kingdom recently issued a special announcement to deny this, stating, "Our emperor now proclaims to the world that he is willing to make all kinds of sacrifices, so that the League of Nations can mediate and reach a compromise with Italy within the scope of the Covenant. This purpose remains the same now as in the past, but sacrifice does not mean giving up any rights. Our emperor will never abdicate, nor will he give up his sovereignty. The people of all countries are afraid that the Italian-Abyssinian issue may cause a world war. Our emperor is now willing to do his best to avoid it. As for our country's representative to the League of Nations, our emperor does not want to order him to withdraw from Geneva." (30th Havas)</p>
<h3>Chieftain of Abyssinia Petitions England: Requesting Trusteeship of Western Territory, British Government Politely Declines</h3>
<p>(London) Sixty chieftains of the Galla tribe in western Abyssinia, representing two million people, submitted a petition in August to the British Consul in Gore, western Abyssinia, requesting him to forward it to the British government. They asked the British government to accept the trusteeship of 50,000 square miles of land in western Abyssinia. The British government politely declined. The Abyssinian Legation in London issued a press release tonight, expressing regret and denying rumors of unrest in western Abyssinia. It stated, "Since the Italian army inhumanely used asphyxiating gas against the Abyssinian people, the League of Nations has failed to provide assistance to the Abyssinian people as stipulated in the covenant, which is clear. Previously, some Abyssinian chieftains, seeing that trustee territories around the world were gaining liberation, believed that Abyssinia should seek British trusteeship; otherwise, Abyssinia would inevitably be occupied by Italy and could not avoid it, nor could it maintain its sovereign independence. At that time, the Abyssinian government was aware of these chieftains' movement but did not wish to obstruct it. Unfortunately, the British government ultimately did not accept the trusteeship system, which the Emperor of Abyssinia deeply regrets," (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Czech Chief of Staff Observes French Military Exercise</h3>

<h3>Loan Issue: French-Polish Negotiations Stall</h3>
<p>Warsaw: According to well-informed sources here, one of the important consequences of the French franc's devaluation is that negotiations for the second French loan, intended for the construction of railways in mining areas, which began during the French Minister of Commerce's visit to Warsaw, have broken down. The planned trip to Paris by relevant ministers has been indefinitely postponed, and negotiations on the detailed terms of the planned French loan for Polish rearmament have also been deferred.

<h3>US Invites Countries to Participate: Tripartite Monetary Agreement Can Help International Financial Stability; No Fixed Exchange Rate for Dollar and Pound</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau formally invited countries today to participate in the recently established Anglo-Franco-American monetary agreement, stating that if other countries could join unanimously, it would greatly contribute to the stability of international finance. The absence of an equalization fund would not matter. Secretary Morgenthau is paying close attention to the exchange market and is prepared to use the equalization fund of 200 million yuan at any time to prevent the depreciation of the pound. It is also understood that the United Kingdom is prepared to use its equalization fund of 180 million yuan to curb fluctuations in the dollar. Regarding the contents of the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement, the Secretary declared that there are no other secret clauses in the agreement and that no fixed exchange rate has been set for the dollar and the pound. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau stated today during a meeting with members of the press that the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement does not contain provisions for the mutual exchange of dollars and pounds, nor does it involve the issue of war debts. Morgenthau declined to comment on whether the agreement would form the basis for considering the war debt issue. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(New York) What Wall Street is most concerned about now is the relationship between the dollar and the pound. According to exchange experts, Britain is currently eager to stabilize the pound at a price no lower than the originally set rate of 4.86, but the United States may be willing to go even higher than this price. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Indian Government Does Not Want to Lower Currency Value</h3>
<p>Simla: Sir James Grigg, Finance Member of the Governor-General's Executive Council, stated today in the Legislative Assembly that the Indian government has decided not to compete with other countries by lowering its currency value. The government intends to maintain the current exchange rate between the pound and the rupee, which is beneficial to India and international recovery. The knight made this statement when addressing criticisms of the government for not publishing its monetary policy motions. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>French Senate Discusses New Monetary Bill; Finance Committee's Review Slightly Modifies Original Bill</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate convened at 9:40 this morning to discuss the new monetary bill proposed by the government. The Chairman, Speaker Jeanneney, heard the report from the rapporteur of the Senate Finance Committee, Caillaux, on the results of the committee's review. The report advocated passing the first thirteen articles of the new monetary bill, namely the various clauses concerning the technical aspects of currency devaluation. As for the other twelve articles, which authorized the government to stipulate compensation measures to adapt to the cost of living, it was proposed to delete them and replace them with revised text. After the report was completed, several senators spoke in succession, expressing disagreement with the government's original proposal. The Chairman then announced that the meeting would be adjourned until 2:30 in the afternoon for a vote. General observers believe that Senator Caillaux, former Prime Minister and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, whose slogan is "Currency devaluation is enough; nothing else is desired," will likely have most senators base their decisions on Caillaux's words when voting this afternoon and vote against the last twelve articles of the government's original bill. People in the senators' lounge also believe that because the Senate Finance Committee's amendments to the last twelve articles of the original bill are very different from the original bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, the two houses will likely have to send the bill back and forth several times before a final vote can be taken. (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The result of the Senate Finance Committee's review of the monetary bill is that it has decided to accept the opening articles of the monetary bill, namely the provisions concerning the reduction of the gold content of the franc, but advocates separating these articles from the other articles of the monetary bill. As for the compensation measures for the losses suffered by various citizens due to the devaluation of the franc, it is proposed that they be stipulated separately in future laws and not necessarily within the monetary law. The Finance Committee also does not approve of the provision "authorizing the government to maintain the purchasing power of the franc," believing that according to the law of August 20 this year, the government could originally prohibit improper price increases at any time. Therefore, if anyone raises prices in the future on the grounds of the devaluation of the franc, the government can prohibit it. However, if the price of raw materials increases after the devaluation of the franc, the government should not prohibit the rise in prices. Regarding the method of levying the profits obtained from hoarding gold after the devaluation of the franc, the Finance Committee also believes that it should be amended, namely that exporters of gold and silver jewelry should be treated as an exception and that the levy of profits should be limited to those who hoard cash.

<h3>Swiss Parliament Authorizes Government to Safeguard Economic Order</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: The Swiss House of Representatives has granted the government full powers to safeguard economic order. (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Bern, the Swiss capital: After thirteen hours of debate, the Swiss lower house finally passed, by a vote of 99 to 6, the government's actions to devalue the Swiss franc and temporarily prohibit the export of cash at midnight. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Dutch New Currency Law Passed by Both Houses</h3>
<p>The Hague: Prime Minister Colijn presented a new monetary bill to Parliament yesterday, which included (1) prohibiting the export of cash, (2) establishing an exchange equalization fund of 300 million guilders, and (3) preventing price increases. This bill was passed by both houses today. (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Prime Minister Colijn explained the government's monetary policy in the Upper House this afternoon, saying, "The government has no intention of changing the currency laws, nor has it determined the new gold content of the guilder. In other words, the government is not attempting to devalue the statutory value of the guilder. However, the current turbulent international market situation is indeed unfavorable to the guilder and may gradually lead to a decline in the exchange rate of the guilder. Its future is unpredictable. Therefore, although the Dutch National Bank has sufficient cash reserves, it has no choice but to temporarily abandon the gold standard. After the gold standard is abandoned, the actual new exchange rate of the guilder may be beneficial to trade, which is what I hope for. As for the exchange rate between the Dutch guilder and the guilder used in the Dutch East Indies, it will remain unchanged." (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Small Central European Countries Consider Adopting New Measures</h3>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic: Cabinet members met today to discuss the impact of the franc devaluation on the Czech currency. If the Czech government decides to take similar measures to devalue the Czech currency, it must first convene Parliament to pass it, as the plenary powers law previously passed by Parliament does not stipulate that the government can order monetary measures. (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romanian capital: Finance Minister Cancicov recently consulted with the Minister of Commerce and the President of the Romanian Central Bank on the international monetary situation created by the devaluation of the franc. Afterwards, Cancicov issued a declaration, stating briefly that the Romanian monetary system is not affected by the devaluation of the franc and there is no need to change it. Even if the Romanian government is forced to take action, it should be done after consulting with its allies (referring to the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente). (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>

<h3>Compromise Reached Between Japan and Russia on North Sakhalin Oil Extraction Issue</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Negotiations between the Soviet Russian government and the Japanese Petroleum Company on the issue of Japan's extraction of crude oil and mineral resources on the Russian-controlled northern Sakhalin Island have been underway here for more than four months. It is now learned that these negotiations have been completed, and the two parties will sign an agreement in early next month. The original term for Japan's oil extraction in northern Sakhalin was due to expire in December of this year. After negotiations between the Japanese Petroleum Company and the Soviet Russian authorities, the Soviet Russian government agreed to extend it for three years, while Japan advocated an extension of five years. The manager of the company, Rear Admiral Sakonji, came to Russia in late June to continue negotiations. As a result, the Soviet Russian government agreed to grant the company certain rights, and the Japanese side also made promises to improve the treatment of workers, especially workers' housing. The two sides were able to reach a compromise. (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Naval Battle Between Spanish Government and Rebel Forces South of Gibraltar: One Government Ship Sunk, Large Numbers of Rebel Troops Cross Sea for Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: Spanish government and rebel warships engaged in a fierce naval battle today west of Tarifa in the Strait of Gibraltar. One government warship, a destroyer, was sunk, and another was heavily damaged. Participating in the battle on the rebel side were the cruisers "Baleares" and "Admiral Cervera," while on the government side were the destroyers "Admiral Fernández" and "Guadalquivir." The rebel cruisers were better armed, so the government destroyers were unable to resist. "Admiral Fernández" was hit repeatedly and sank. The French mail ship "Cordoba" rescued the ship's crew. "Guadalquivir," although pursued by "Baleares" and heavily damaged, managed to escape to the port of Casa Blanca, where the wounded were taken ashore. This naval battle is of great significance, as the rebels immediately transported troops and ammunition from Ceuta across the strait to Algeciras after the battle. The purpose of the rebel cruisers was to clear the sea to allow the transport fleet to cross the sea safely. The fleet consisted of one transport ship flying a gold and yellow flag, nineteen fishing boats, escorted by four aircraft and followed by one torpedo boat and the cruiser "Admiral Cervera." The rebels' second cruiser remained in Ceuta to guard. The fleet crossed the sea safely without any losses. It is reported that it will return to Ceuta within days to continue transporting 2,000 troops. It is also reported that a rebel column of 8,000 cavalry and artillery is planning a major offensive against the government naval base of Malaga north of Gibraltar within the week. This operation will be assisted at sea by the cruisers "Admiral Cervera" and "Baleares." (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Government troops are actively preparing to retreat to the capital today. Various artisans have been conscripted to make Madrid an invincible fortress. Barber shops have now been ordered to close, causing barbers to join the militia to fight. The Ministry of the Interior has now implemented food rationing to prevent hoarding.

<h3>Government Intensifies Defenses Around Madrid</h3>
<p>Toledo: After receiving news that rebel forces have begun attacking the capital, the government is working day and night around Madrid, building three lines of defense. Meanwhile, according to a broadcast from the Seville radio station, some cabinet members have gone to the southwestern coastal port of Alicante to prepare to move the government there. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Madrid: General Franco, commander of the rebel southern front, previously issued a radio statement saying that he intended to occupy the railway lines southeast of the capital, especially the city of Aranjuez, where the railway lines intersect, in order to cut off Madrid's traffic with the Mediterranean Sea. Recognizing that the capital would be in imminent danger if Aranjuez were to fall, the government troops have intensified defenses in the southeast near Madrid in preparation for this. In addition, government aircraft were very active on the western front yesterday, in order to relieve the pressure of the rebel forces. Our correspondent witnessed five government aircraft flying to the Maqueda and Torrijos areas, dropping bombs. (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Relief of Fortress: Garrison Awarded Medals</h3>
<p>City of Toledo: The Nationalist forces, who had been besieged in the Alcázar fortress for more than two months, have now been relieved. General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist forces, held a medal-awarding ceremony in the ruins of the Alcázar. He awarded the highest Spanish honor, the Grand Cross of Saint Ferdinand, to Colonel Moscardó, commander of the Alcázar garrison. All officers and soldiers were also given the same medal. General Franco also gave a speech in the rubble, saying, "The garrison of the Alcázar is the pride of Spain. The Alcázar of the past was the place where generations of officers were trained. It has now been destroyed. We must build a brand new Alcázar. You are its model. From now on, we must also take on the role of builders of the Spanish Empire. Long live Spain!" (Havas Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Account by Rescued Wounded Soldier: Conditions of the Siege of the Fortress, The Garrison's Resistance is Laudable</h3>
<p>Talavera, Southern Front: A wounded soldier who was among the first to be rescued from the Alcázar fortress and has been admitted to the city hospital today told Mr. Holme, Reuters special correspondent on the southern front, about the indelible and indestructible fighting. The man was severely wounded, with a high temperature, and his condition was pitiful. At the time, he was only covered in dirty rags and was extremely hungry, but as he recounted the hardships endured by the fortress's soldiers during the seventy-day siege and their brave resistance against the superior government forces, a look of pride appeared on his face. Among the 1,200 soldiers, there was only one doctor, who worked tirelessly day and night. Food was extremely scarce, with only one horse being slaughtered each day to supplement the meager food thrown into the fortress from the sky by rebel aircraft. Garrison Commander Major Moscardó established a hospital, calling on women with higher education to serve as nurses. Discipline in the fortress was strict, with everyone having to attend Holy Communion daily. The garrison was greatly encouraged by listening to military news broadcasts on the radio, and they published a humorous daily newspaper, handwritten on blank paper from old books, to relieve the soldiers' boredom. Last week, two babies were born in the fortress, causing great excitement among the people, and morale was boosted. The warriors formally swore again that they would rather die in battle than let the newborn babies fall into the hands of the enemy. Although the detonation of landmines was always expected, when the first major explosion occurred, it was as if the end of the world had come. Many died, and the women endured the pain and dared not shed tears, fearing to discourage the soldiers' courage. The wounded soldier continued, "On Sunday, when we were at the juncture of life and death, we suddenly heard the sound of artillery fire, knowing that help had arrived. The excitement at that time was indescribable. The soldiers in the fortress were greatly emboldened and rushed out to chase after the militia, who fled like rabbits and ran towards Madrid. The daily newspaper published in the fortress contained a story last week about a loyal and tragic news event. The militia headquarters telephoned Major Moscardó, telling him that if he did not surrender the fortress, they would kill his son. Moscardó asked to speak to his son, so Moscardó ordered his son on the phone to die generously, not losing the nature of a hero, and ordered his son to pray to God at that time and shout 'Long live Spain!' It is said that his son was shot by government troops that morning. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Italian Officers Involved in the Rebellion on Mallorca: Spanish Government Plans to Appeal to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) The Paris "Le Matin" recently revealed that the rebel forces on the Spanish island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean are led by Italian General Rossi. Responsible sources here are not entirely unaware of this fact, but in order to avoid submitting the matter to international bodies and causing disputes, they do not want to publicize it. However, if the progress of the Spanish unrest is sufficient to disrupt international order, and once the Spanish rebel forces win and the situation in the country returns to normal, if Italian General Rossi is still serving the rebel forces, then the United Kingdom may change its attitude and take strong action to deal with it. It is generally believed that Spanish Foreign Minister del Vayo will lodge a complaint with the League of Nations regarding the involvement of Italian officers in the rebellion on the Spanish island of Mallorca. France and Russia advocate that the matter be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee for discussion, while Britain does not want it to be submitted to the Committee. (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Editor-in-Chief of Pravda Arrested: Suspected of Aiding Counter-Revolutionaries</h3>

<h3>Martial Law Implemented in Palestine: Authority of British Military Commander to be Expanded if Necessary</h3>
<p>(London) The government gazette has published an order stipulating that martial law be immediately declared in Palestine. According to the martial law, Lieutenant General Dill, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Palestine, may take all measures to strengthen defenses and maintain public security. General Dill will also enjoy various privileges, the most important of which is the establishment of military courts. All those who violate the laws and regulations promulgated by the local military authorities will be tried by the court. The laws and regulations that the military authorities may promulgate are as follows: (1) All publications, including maps and photographs, may be inspected; (2) All persons may be arrested, detained, expelled, or relocated; (3) Ports, ships, airfields, and all means of transportation may be managed; (4) In certain circumstances, ownership of people's property may be cancelled; (5) In the event of disturbances, even if the main offenders cannot be apprehended, the authorities may impose collective fines on the residents of the area. General Dill and his representatives may take various decisions, and no one may appeal to the judiciary. Responsible sources here have stated that although this martial law has been promulgated, the Arab national leaders in Palestine may still invite neighboring monarchs to mediate in order to bring the strike and market boycott movement and disturbances to an end, so as to preserve their dignity. However, if the Arab nation disregards making peaceful gestures to end the dispute, the British government will take strong measures to deal with it. British troops are now continuously heading to Palestine. In the future, the government will use military institutions to handle the disputes in the area until the dispute is resolved and order is restored. If a solution cannot be reached, order will be restored by force. (Havas Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt’s Campaign Speech: Denies Belief in Communism</h3>
<p>New York State, Syracuse—The state's Democratic Party of New York recently held a convention here. President Roosevelt immediately delivered a speech to kick off his election campaign. In response to criticisms from the outside world regarding the New Deal policies implemented by the current government, which accused them of having communist leanings, the President sternly refuted these claims. He stated that the Republican Party, during its twelve years in power, had disregarded monetary and social issues, nearly leading the United States into the abyss of communism, and should therefore be held accountable. As for the bankers and business leaders who have benefited greatly from the New Deal, they are still complaining. It's like the old saying: an old man fell into a river and was fortunate enough to be rescued by a friend. Upon being rescued, instead of expressing gratitude, he blamed his friend for not retrieving his hat that was lost in the river. Is such resentment appropriate? The government is now striving to promote the well-being of society. Voters should take a moment to consider whether the government's actions resemble communist ideals in any way. After the President concluded his speech, the audience of 6,000 people applauded enthusiastically in agreement. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Poland's Ethnic Minorities: German Assimilation Policy</h3>
<p>Warsaw—Germany is currently implementing an assimilation policy towards the Polish ethnic minority within its borders, hoping to bring them under the umbrella of Germanic ideology. For example, the names of villages that were originally in Polish are now being changed to German. Within churches, the use of Polish in hymns is also prohibited. According to a Polish newspaper report from Silesia in Germany, there is a severe shortage of grain within Germany, and the smuggling of grain into Germany from the border area is rampant. Officials here expressed great displeasure upon learning of this, stating that although Germany and Poland have signed a non-aggression pact, such a phenomenon still exists, which is regrettable.

<h3>Key Figures from Hebei and Chahar Gather in Tianjin: No Discussions on the Current Situation: Qin States Meeting Was Coincidental: Song to Return to Beiping in Three or Four Days</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It was rumored that Qin Dechun, Guo Zihua, Lin Shize, Liu Ruming, Ge Dingyuan, Jia Deyao, Jia Yuzhang, Zhang Zizhong, and other Hebei-Chahar personnel had gathered in Tianjin and met at Song Zheyuan's private residence to discuss the current situation and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China. This morning, Qin Dechun stated that everyone was in Tianjin to report to Song Zheyuan, and their meeting was coincidental. Rumors of meetings to discuss the current situation and Sino-Japanese cooperation are purely speculative. Song will return to Beiping in three or four days. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Apart from the Fengtai incident, there have been no recent diplomatic developments in North China. The two issues of Hebei and Chahar have been shelved for some time. The "clarified" government advocated by a certain party is vague and offers no concrete plan. The authorities are dealing with all sudden problems with a calm approach, gradually resolving them. Song will leave Tianjin and return to Beiping after his private affairs are completed. The rumors circulating are mostly spread by those with ulterior motives. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan summoned Song Meicun, the chief of staff of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Headquarters, to Tianjin to give him instructions. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun said that although rumors in Beiping and Tianjin are rampant, the people are quite calm. This is because the Japanese army has recently resumed exercises, but in reality, there are no other problems. According to my observation, nothing unexpected will happen. Chairman Song will return to Beiping in two or three days to take charge of everything. The situation in eastern Suiyuan seems more tense, but the defenses there are tight, and it is unlikely that bandits will succeed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>England to South Africa Air Race: Nine Participating Aircraft</h3>
<p>(London) The England-Johannesburg air race began at 6:30 AM yesterday at the Plymouth flying field. A total of nine aircraft are participating, departing at one-minute intervals. Currently in the lead is Captain Halse, who landed in Khartoum (capital of Sudan in East Africa), halfway to the destination, at 1:52 AM this morning, the first of the remaining five competitors to arrive. Halse was also the first to arrive in Cairo after flying 2,200 miles in twelve and a half hours. Nine and a half minutes later, Aviation Officer Clouston's plane followed. However, Halse only took 31 minutes to refuel, while Clouston took 37 minutes, so Halse was able to reach Khartoum first. Scott (the winner of the London-Melbourne air race in Australia) and Guthrie, as well as Lewellin and Houston, may have jointly arrived in Cairo first. Scott landed at 11:14 PM last night and took off again at 11:34 PM. Lewellin landed at 11:18 PM and took off again at 11:36 PM. The two even shook hands across their planes. Ross and Bagshaw's plane damaged its undercarriage while on the ground in Cairo, making it the fourth plane to drop out of the race. The first to drop out was Ardington and Bush's plane, which was forced to land near Regensburg in Bavaria. The second was Miller's plane, which ran out of fuel and landed in Ruma, Hungary. The third was South African aviator Smith's plane, which landed in Skopje, Seville due to a change in oil. The planes that arrived in Cairo were greatly welcomed. The flying field was illuminated like daytime, and thousands of car headlights shone on the nearby desert. The organization was very complete. After the planes arrived, sentry lines were set up to prevent interference from spectators, and loudspeakers were used to report the progress of the competitors. Sir Sassoon, the Under-Secretary of State for Air, and Air Marshal Popham were both in attendance. The entire race is 6,150 miles long and was initiated by Schlesinger, a well-known South African industrialist. The winner will receive a prize of 10,000 pounds, as he wants to demonstrate that Johannesburg is less than two days' flight from England. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Cairo—Captain Halse, participating in the 10,000-pound air race from Portsmouth to Johannesburg, is still far ahead. He arrived in Mbeya, Northern Rhodesia, at noon today.

If successful, Halse will have traveled 6,110 miles from Portsmouth in less than 36 hours. Lewellin is currently in second place. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>High-Altitude Flight: British Pilot Sets New Record: 9.5 Miles Above Ground</h3>
<p>(London) Squadron Leader Swain, currently a member of the test flight department at the Farnborough air force factory, has set a new world altitude record of 49,967 feet, or approximately 9.5 miles. The previous record was set six weeks ago by French aviator Detre, at 48,698 feet. The plane used to break the record was reportedly a Bristol Type 138A, used by the British Air Force for altitude testing, equipped with a specially made Pegasus engine. Official representatives from the Royal Aero Club were present to observe the event. The aircraft took off from the Farnborough flying field and landed at Nysalas Farm thirty minutes later. Swain said afterwards that his body quickly became weak due to the high altitude. He urgently cut open his flight suit with a knife to save his life. When he reached an altitude of 46,000 feet, he checked the fuel level and found that it was only enough for a little over an hour of flight. Glancing down, the light was dazzling, and the entire coastline of England was visible. He couldn't help but feel that England was extremely small. At this point, he began to feel that his flight suit was very uncomfortable, making it difficult to move his hands and feet, but breathing was not yet difficult. When he reached 51,000 feet, he felt that he could no longer ascend and began to prepare for descent. At that time, the goggles on his leather helmet were completely covered in steam, and the small windows of the plane were covered in frost, making it difficult to distinguish the steering wheel inside the aircraft. He then felt difficulty breathing and gradually became weak. He tried to open the plane window, but to no avail. He was forced to cut a small hole in his flight suit with a knife to allow air in and avoid suffocation. He knew that the fuel was about to run out, so he urgently descended. At that time, he did not know that he had broken the altitude record. The plane was equipped with two altimeters, which have now been sent to the Teddington National Physical Laboratory for inspection. The flight suit worn by Swain was also specially made, and the fuselage of the plane was tightly sealed. The aircraft used was ordered by the Air Ministry from the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1934.

<h3>Japanese Troops Gather in Beiping to Hold Large-Scale Exercises; Scheduled for Ten Days with Nearly Two Thousand Participants; Everything Based on Actual Combat Standards</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the increase of Japanese garrison troops in North China, Japanese soldiers have been constantly conducting exercises in the suburbs of Beiping, Fengtai, Lugouqiao, Changxindian and other places. Recently, it was decided to hold a large-scale exercise in late October. The Japanese garrison troops in Beiping, Fengtai, and Tongxian, totaling three thousand men, were originally scheduled to start the exercise on the 26th of this month for ten days. Later, due to circumstances, the start was postponed to the 30th, still for ten days. More than three hundred Japanese soldiers stationed in Tongxian, carrying eight small cannons, arrived in Beiping by special train at 6:15 AM on the 29th. Around 2 PM in the afternoon, another five hundred Japanese soldiers from Fengtai and Tongxian, in seven heavy trucks, thirty-five motorcycles with sidecars, and five tanks, arrived in Beiping from Tongxian. After entering Chaoyangmen, they went straight to the Dongdan Pailou parade ground via Dongsi Pailou to assemble. The more than three hundred Japanese soldiers who arrived in Beiping in the morning also participated. Major General Kawabe Masazo, the brigade commander of the Japanese garrison in Beiping, Koshiro Takayoshi, the head of the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Beiping Agency, Takeo Imai, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, and Mutaguchi, the commander of the military police, gave speeches to the Japanese soldiers. At the same time, the Japanese Embassy notified more than a thousand Japanese residents, men and women, in Beiping to go to the Dongdan parade ground to welcome them. The expatriates held small flags, displaying their might, attracting the extreme attention of the general public. Around Dongdan, the onlookers were like a fortress. The event ended around 5 PM. After the increase, the Japanese garrison in Beiping had already reached a thousand men. Now, with the arrival of another eight hundred men, the Japanese barracks were unable to accommodate them. The newly arrived Japanese soldiers were introduced by the Japanese military and lodged in the residences of Japanese merchants such as Mitsui &amp; Co., Okura &amp; Co., and Xinchang &amp; Co., as well as Japanese expatriate residences in Xiguan Yin Temple in Dongdan, with three to five, ten to twenty or more people staying in each home. Dinner was hosted by the Japanese expatriates. Tonight, Japanese merchants also prepared a thousand lunch boxes for the Japanese soldiers to use during the exercises. After the troops arrived in Beiping, the temporary headquarters was set up in the Mitsubishi Company in Dongdan. That night, Japanese officers and others held a meeting in the company to discuss various matters related to the exercises. At midnight, a unit of about a hundred soldiers who arrived in Beiping set off and rested in the Dongchang'an Street area. As a result, rumors started again in Beiping tonight, and the people were in a state of panic. In order to prevent any eventuality, the authorities imposed an invisible curfew tonight. According to sources, although there have been many rumors lately, the facts are not yet such. There should be no changes in the short term.</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops from Fengtai and Tongxian arrived in Beiping, they assembled again at the Dongdan parade ground at 8 AM on the 30th. Nearly two thousand Japanese soldiers from the Beiping garrison set off for exercises in various locations. One part was in the area of Da Jing Village outside Guang'anmen within the Beiping city limits, one part was in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, north of Baoding and south of Zhuozhou, and one part was in the western section of the Beinning Railway near Fengtai. After the ten-day exercise, they will leave Beiping. What they are practicing is guerrilla warfare, simulated city attacks, and tank maneuvers, all based on actual combat standards, in order to conduct on-the-ground surveys of the terrain for military reference. Therefore, the Japanese military's purpose in holding another large-scale exercise of the Japanese garrison in North China after this exercise is noteworthy. (29th)</p>
<h3>Large Fire in Guangzhou City; More Than One Hundred Shops Destroyed in Yongsheng XiasSha District</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of autumn, the wind has been high and the weather dry. Fire alarms have been frequent in Guangzhou City. A large fire broke out in Yongshengsha at 8 PM on the 25th, and another fire broke out on Xihua Road at 9 AM on the 27th, causing casualties and significant losses. The following is a summary of the disaster:</p>
<p>Xihua Road: Xihua Road Tail is located in the old Ximen Rainbow Bridge area, with dozens of houses and shops located next to each other. At 9:30 AM on the 27th, unlisted address at the bus stop, the remnants of a cigarette end ignited a straw canopy. In an instant, the flames soared into the sky, spreading to the neighboring lumber store, and soon turned into a prairie fire. The fire brigade rushed to the scene with fire engines to put out the fire. After a while, nearby shops such as Longtai Store, Huancaili Yongxiang Store, Yongli Store, and more than ten unlisted houses were all burned down. A young child of about four years old from the Su family was burned to death, and two firefighters were injured while fighting the fire.</p>
<p>Yongshengsha: This place is located in the east of Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Former Jian Branch. The place name is Yongsheng XiasSha, mostly inhabited by poor people and boat dwellers. XiasSha Main Street also has three horizontal lanes, with a population of two thousand. It is close to the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's Aquaculture Farm, facing the Dasha Head Small River and backing onto hundreds of acres of vegetable ponds. The streets are narrow, and the shops are densely packed. There are a total of two to three hundred households. In addition to the boat dwellers, most residents are engaged in the manufacture of "joss sticks". There are several incense factories, with ten or dozens of workers each, being a rare survival of old-fashioned handicraft industry. At around 8 PM on the 25th, a fire suddenly broke out at the Lian'an Incense Store , at No. 19 to No. 21, a row of three buildings, all incense factories, with dozens of workers. It is not known how the fire started, but it happened after the workers had finished work and were leaving for the day. Most of the other houses are low, supported by wooden frames, making them easily flammable. The northwest wind was strong that night, fanning the flames, making them even fiercer. In just fifteen minutes, the flames soared into the sky, spreading to the neighbors. A loud explosion suddenly occurred at the fire scene, the sound shaking the entire city. The citizens were shocked and thought that an accident had occurred. At this time, most of the firefighters who went to put out the fire also retreated. After the loud noise, there were continuous string of firecrackers, as dense as a string of beads. Moreover, the houses there were built close to the shore, making firefighting even more difficult. As a result, in the blaze, the refugees supported the old and carried the young, shouting and running for their lives, blocking the road. Many people fell into the water due to the crowding. Fortunately, the river was not deep, so they were not drowned, but those who were injured and moaning could be heard from a distance. After the fire brigade worked hard to put out the fire, the fire gradually subsided at around 10 PM and was completely extinguished by 12 PM. It is estimated that the entire Yongsheng XiasSha district, one street and three lanes, were completely destroyed. Hundreds of shops were turned into rubble. The refugees were displaced and their cries shook the sky. Except for those who went to stay with relatives and friends overnight, most were sleeping in the open, in a miserable situation. That night, the fire brigade and the convenience hospital rescue team rescued twelve men and women, including Wang Peng and others, who had been burned. The Public Security Bureau dispatched personnel overnight to take in those who were homeless, but the number of people was too large to provide relief to all. Subsequent investigations revealed that the loud noise at the fire scene that night seemed to be caused by explosive materials. It was said that there was a shop in a certain alley in the street that usually bought old miscellaneous items.

<h3>Anhui Province Organizes; Land Tax Collection on Abandoned Land; 4.3 Million Mu of Abandoned Land; Confiscation if Tax is not Paid After Deadline</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The amount of abandoned land in Anhui Province has now reached more than 4.3 million mu, accounting for more than one-tenth of the cultivated land. Therefore, the Department of Finance regards the collection of land tax on abandoned land as an important policy for reorganizing finances. In addition to instructing the county magistrates to strictly organize it, it has also sent commissioners to supervise and urge them, and has formulated supplementary measures to allow the people to report it. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be treated as official property. As for the reorganization of official property and official wasteland, it has also convened meetings of the heads of the official property reclamation bureaus of various counties, as well as the special commissioner for clearing the official property in Huo Qiu (i.e., Zhang Jingyao's confiscated property) and the supervisory committee for official property reclamation in Tongcheng County to discuss the methods to be adopted in the future to facilitate progress and increase tax revenue. The newly reclaimed land in the various districts of Wuhu was originally mostly water storage lakes and marshes, close to 45,000 mu. The county government has repeatedly received orders from the province to organize the collection of land tax. However, due to repeated internal disputes among the reclamation companies over the years, with constant mutual accusations, the embankments of the enclosed weirs were not strong, and they collapsed during the rainy season, resulting in no autumn harvest. The losses of each weir were very heavy. The county government, seeing that the facts were all there, did not actively carry out the issue of land tax collection. Now that the weather has been favorable this year and the autumn harvest has been bountiful, it has assigned personnel to specialize in the matter of land tax collection. Among all the newly reclaimed weirs, the area of Yi Tai Weir is the largest, so the land tax collection for that weir will be handled first, followed by the other weirs. The supplementary measures for land tax collection on abandoned land formulated by the Department of Finance are recorded below: Article 1: For abandoned land in various counties that has not been applied for land tax collection by the end of June of the 25th year, it is still allowed to retroactively apply for land tax collection. Article 2: For abandoned land that is retroactively applied for land tax collection, before the end of June of the 26th year, the land tax for the past three years will still be paid according to the original method. From July 1st to the end of December of the 26th year, for land that is retroactively applied for land tax collection, in addition to paying the land tax for the past three years, penalties will also be imposed according to the following regulations: (1) For those who collect land tax within July and August of the 26th year, a fine of up to 20% of the land price will be imposed. If the owner of the abandoned land is a self-cultivating farmer or an organization, and the land is not connected to official wasteland due to lake or river siltation, and the application for land tax collection is made voluntarily, the penalty may be reduced or a special request may be made to exempt it from the penalty. Article 3: All land that has not been taxed by the end of December of the 26th year will be regarded as official wasteland and handled in accordance with the official wasteland regulations. Article 4: Hidden land is allowed to be publicly reported by the people. After verification and collection of land tax, 5% of the land tax paid will be allocated as a reward for the reporting. Article 5: The affairs of retroactive land tax collection in various counties will still be handled by the original established offices, and the Department of Finance will send personnel to supervise and urge them, depending on the circumstances.

<h3>Industries; Successfully Passing Autumn Festival; Silver and Banking Industries Take Holiday Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Li Qingxuan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Successful Results from Northern Trip to Negotiate Anti-Smuggling Measures</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Li Qingxuan, a consultant of the Ministry of Finance, was ordered to travel north to negotiate anti-smuggling issues in North China with the Hebei-Chahar authorities. The matter has been completed, and he returned to Beijing the night before last to report to Minister Kong. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning in the same car as Mr. Kong. According to inquiries from Central News Agency reporters, Mr. Li's trip was successful, and the anti-smuggling measures have been negotiated with some progress. The main points are as follows: (1) The Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office, formerly known as the Cangyan Coast Defense Inspection Office, has been established for a long time and was originally responsible for inspecting bandits, firearms, and drugs. Although someone previously suggested to Chairman Song that the office should collect light taxes on smuggled goods, Song did not adopt the suggestion. Therefore, the office has not only never collected taxes, but has also stopped the inspection work it once engaged in. This issue has become a thing of the past and does not need to be discussed further. (2) Separate discussions are being held on supplementary tax payment and sales methods for existing smuggled goods in Tianjin and Beijing, and there are already some clues. However, whether to implement the original plan depends on reporting to Minister Kong and waiting for his decision. (3) At the same time, discussions have also been held on fundamental measures to prevent smuggling, but the matter is of great importance and requires detailed deliberation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Social Education Bureaus Merged Today, Internal Organization Set Up Five Sections and One Office, Annual Savings of More Than 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>After the vacancy of Wu Xingya, the former director of the Municipal Social Bureau, the Municipal Government immediately ordered Pan, the director of the Education Bureau, to act as a substitute, and requested the approval of the Executive Yuan to merge the two bureaus, with Pan Gongzhan as the director of the Social Bureau. It is learned that the merger plan of the two bureaus has been drafted by Mr. Pan and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, which will be implemented in the near future. A Central News Agency reporter visited Director Pan at the Social Bureau yesterday (30th) and was granted an interview. The situation of the conversation is recorded as follows: (Question) When will your bureau be merged? (Answer) It will be merged and reorganized according to the approved plan tomorrow (October 1st). (Question) What are the details of the reorganization? (Answer) After the reorganization, the Social Bureau will be divided into five sections and one office, which is three sections and one office less than the previous Social Education Bureaus. The detailed organization and budget have not yet been fully determined. (Question) What is the amount of the budget? (Answer) This time, the Municipal Government merged and reorganized the Social Education Bureaus for the purpose of saving expenses. I have repeatedly consulted with the Mayor and decided that the annual expenditure must be reduced by more than 100,000 yuan, which is about 10,000 yuan less per month than before. (Question) With the implementation of this austerity measure, will it affect the cause? (Answer) There are considerable difficulties in both personnel and the cause. For example, in handling the cause, the affiliated institutions have to be reduced in quantity. Although all the newly appointed staff are hired as old employees as much as possible, there are still more than one-third of those who are left out. There are many experienced and specialized talents among them, but it is helpless due to the limitations of the facts. (Question) Can you show me a thing or two about the future administrative policy? (Answer) In the short term, we should start with the regulation and reorganization of the relevant internal departments. In the second step, we should seek to rationalize the cause, and strive for the fact that the money is not wasted and the matter is practical. This year, various places are fortunate to report a bumper harvest. I would like to take this opportunity to carry out the construction of the meeting and accumulate grain to regulate the people's food. However, in fact, the municipal treasury is very short of funds, and there are still various obstacles. We are actively discussing it.</p>

<h3>Purple Dike, Gentlemen Please List, Hou Tongzeng as a Local Sage of Jiangsu, Submitting to the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Chengbo, a local gentleman of Zidi (that is, Zhuzhai Town) in this city, Hou Zhongjie Gong Tongzeng, who rose up in Jiading at the end of the Ming Dynasty, resisted the Manchu Qing Dynasty, fought bloody battles for more than 20 days, and devoted his strength to martyrdom, was a national hero, and his articles, morality, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, propriety, justice, integrity, and shame were all available, which can be a model for thousands of years. A few days ago, Chairman Chiang ordered all provinces to select local sages. Mr. Hou is likely to be included in the local sages of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, he and Hou Shuda, a descendant of Mr. Hou, jointly submitted to the Provincial Government, requesting that he be listed as a local sage of Jiangsu Province, and ordered the Jiading County Government to set up a stone monument in Zilongjiang Village, the hometown of Mr. Hou, that is, Zhuzhai Town, to encourage future generations, and attached the complete works of Mr. Hou for reference. The text of the submission to the Provincial Government said, (omitted above) The public was doubtful when he was young. When he was in his dancing years, he and his brothers Minzeng and Qizeng entered the school together. The officials were surprised by his early wisdom and praised his hut. The three phoenixes in Jiangnan were talented and famous all over the world. The scholar-officials in Wuzhong followed him. Soon after, he was awarded the post of director of the Military Selection Department of the Liudu as a scholar. He did not go to office due to external difficulties. Later, he was awarded the post of director of the Ministry of Officials, but he resigned. He was changed to the director of the Nanjing Literary Selection Department. Later, he moved from the Xunxun Department to the Jiangxi Learning Procuratorate. He was in office for four years, upholding justice and without dogs. He cleared up the malpractices that had accumulated for decades. He respected the elders and encouraged customs, promoted literature and education, established a hundred-year plan, and retained the regulations of academic administration. He did not care about offending the powerful feudal lords. His public service and law-abiding were like this, and his political achievements continued to be remarkable, shocking the country. Later, he was transferred to the Deputy Envoy of Guangdong, and he resigned due to the old age of his parents. He was worshiped as the Right Counselor of Zhejiang, and his name spread far and wide. Zheng Sanjun, the Minister of Personnel, mentioned five people with virtuous abilities in the world, and the public was among them. He was recalled as the vice magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture, but before he went, the capital was captured by Li Chuang, and Emperor Chongzhen devoted himself to the country. At that time, Wu Sangui introduced wolves into the house, and the Tartars usurped the title of emperor. The public heard the news and beat his chest and cried bitterly, vowing to go to the national crisis. He took capital to Nandu, hoping to plan major events together. Unexpectedly, he encountered thieves on board and was rescued after being almost drowned. He returned to bedridden, and even in his coma, he was still concerned with redeeming the national shame. When Hongguang took office in Nanjing, he was summoned as the Left Nayen Tongzhengshi. At first, the public believed that the country had been rebuilt, and it was righteous to expel the captives and unify the country, but unexpectedly, Ma Shiying, Ruan Dachuan, and others stole power and stole the country, and revenge and killing were the matter, bribery was rampant, and they procrastinated. The monarch was昏庸 and the ministers were treacherous. The public knew that there was no long-term ambition, and they did not think that Nansong was safe. He repeatedly claimed illness and refused to come out, but his heart to protect the country and restore the ancestral shrine was not gone. Before long, Nandu was captured, Hongguang fled, enemy riders were rampant, and the atmosphere of Hu was everywhere. The counties in Jiangnan were captured in order. A large number of enemy troops gathered in Wujun to spy on Qiyi (that is, Jiading). The public was bedridden in Longjiang. When he heard about it, he stood up and roared, and the mountains responded. In less than a day, thousands of people gathered. The public entered the city, and tens of thousands of people bowed and welcomed him, and cheered along the road, and then regarded him as the master. Huang Chunyao, Yuan Yao, and Kunzhong, the Jinshi, and the gentlemen in the city, as well as the two sons of the public, Xuan Yan and Xuan Jie, assisted him. The public took out his family property to reward the soldiers and inspire the public. He grasped the key points in an orderly manner, and fought a desperate battle with Li Cheng, the enemy general of Hu. There were dozens of battles of all sizes. The enemy was repeatedly injured. He maintained for more than 20 days. There were no reinforcements from outside, and no food and weapons inside. In the end, the city collapsed due to heavy rain, and the enemy took advantage of it. The city was almost undefended. The public went back to the family temple and committed suicide in Yepu to go to the national crisis. The two sons of the public, Xuan Yan and Xuan Jie, also assisted in righteousness and died. (Omitted in the middle) I beg you to carefully review and approve to be included in my local sages of Jiangsu, to be matched with the virtuous ancestral hall, to be a model for a hundred generations, and to be a model for thousands of years. I also beg you to order the Jiading County Government to set up a stone monument in Longjiang Village, the hometown of Mr. Hou, that is, Zhuzhai Town, which is now Zidi Town (that is, Zhuzhai Town), to make it immortal, to comfort the loyal soul, to worship the sages, to show encouragement, and to encourage future generations. Is there anything appropriate? I beg you to approve and follow. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Children's Savings Starts Today, In order to Cultivate Children's Thrift and Give Interest Increase, Special Casting Savings Post Box and Increase Savings Bag</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's children's savings will be officially launched today. It has issued a circular to all postal districts across the country to implement it at the same time. In order to facilitate children's savings of scattered sums, the bureau has specially cast 7,000 savings post boxes and distributed them to various places for sale, and savings bags are given free of charge. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Two Notices</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau issued a notice saying that the bureau will start handling children's savings business on October 1st of this year. The interest rate of this savings is set at five per cent per week. The procedures for establishing accounts and depositing and withdrawing 款 etc. apply to the regulations of passbook savings. In order to facilitate savers to save scattered 款, new savings bags are available and given to savers free of charge. They can be obtained from the savings counter. I am afraid that it is not fully known, so I hereby announce it. Another notice says that in order to facilitate depositors to save scattered small 款, this bureau has specially made savings post boxes, each with the same key, for sale at one yuan in national currency. From now on, they will be sold at the savings counter of this bureau. I am afraid that it is not fully known, so I hereby announce it. Director Shen Shuyu,</p>
<p>Encouraging Savings</p>
<p>The Children's Savings Regulations have been passed by the Executive Yuan and have been ordered to be opened on schedule in all postal districts across the country. The annual interest rate is set at five percent, which is half a percent higher than ordinary savings, to show the intention of encouraging children's savings. All procedures apply to the regulations of the passbook savings regulations, but the opening of a passbook is reduced to half a yuan. At the same time, it is stipulated that the maximum amount per household shall not exceed 200 yuan, and the withdrawal of 款 is also limited to a maximum of two times per month, and each time shall not exceed one-fifth of the saved 款. In order to avoid the trouble of scattered deposits, special savings bags are prepared, which are made of cardboard and can store two yuan in new currency. There is also a small post box made of lead, with dark green paint and yellow letters, and a key in the shape of a golden airplane, which is exquisite, solid, and sold at a low price for children to save small 款.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Assistance</p>
<p>According to Director Zhang of the Savings Department of the bureau, the purpose of children's savings is purely to promote children's savings and cultivate a frugal virtue, so the interest rate is increased. However, in order to prevent the outflow of currency, all procedures have been carefully studied. Because it is the first time to handle it in our country, it is necessary to make thorough preparations. Although the opening date has been clearly notified, it is feared that postal districts in remote provinces may not be able to realize it at the same time due to the urgency of time. At the same time, for the convenience of handling, the Executive Yuan has been ordered to order the Ministry of Education to notify the education authorities in various provinces and cities to assist, and a universal savings movement will be launched in various places to arouse children's interest.</p>
<p>Opened Today</p>
<p>Datong News Agency said that the children's savings business of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, which opened today, is temporarily limited to the postal administration bureaus in various provinces and cities and their subordinate branches. The bureau has also printed a variety of children's savings publicity brochures, and exquisite and beautiful savings bags, which are divided into compartments and can store new auxiliary coins of five cents, ten cents, and twenty cents, have been distributed to various post offices that handle the children's savings business for application.

<h3>Autumn Native Products Festival Closed Yesterday; Tongqiao Held Native Dish Picnic; All Sectors Plan to Establish Native Products Market</h3>
<p>The Autumn Native Products Festival initiated by the China Native Products Promotion Association has been well received by various sectors of society. Yesterday (30th) was the closing date of the Autumn Native Products Festival. Members were busy moving around, and the situation became even more tense. The Shanghai West People's Livelihood Education Experimental Zone held an expanded native products sports meet. Zhenxin, Sangang, Xu Jing, Zhong'an, and Beiqiao schools in Shanghai South also convened the public to hold native products sports promotion meetings. Hongying No. 2 Elementary School, in conjunction with the Shanghai suburban improvement zone, held seven days of native product patriotism speeches starting yesterday. The Tongqiao Rural Improvement Association, in conjunction with Hongying No. 3 Elementary School, also held a native product promotion speech at 5 PM yesterday. More than 200 people attended. Yu Wenhuan, the chairman, reported on the progress of the native products movement and its relationship to the national economy and people's livelihoods. Next, Zhang Yi, the initiator of the native products movement, gave a speech entitled "Native Products for Birthday Celebrations," stating that the China Native Products Promotion Association's proposal to collect famous native products from all over the country and present them to Chairman Chiang to celebrate his 50th birthday was deeply meaningful. Our country has been surrounded by powers for a long time. Recently, the insatiable encroachment of Japanese imperialism has turned native products into imports, which is very hateful to talk about. Previously, for Mussolini's birthday and Hitler's birthday, the people of those countries picked vegetables and fruits to present. This year, for the leader's birthday, our people can also follow the example of Europe and the West, and present native products to express their birthday wishes, which will benefit the people's livelihood greatly. I hope everyone will respond and jointly support the precarious national foundation and complete the Three Principles of the People. At 7 PM, a picnic was held with more than 50 participants. The wine, dishes, fruits, and snacks were all native products. With the bright moon in the sky, the joy was truly incomparable. It is also reported that the people of Xinzhi County have decided to actively promote the native products movement after the Autumn Native Products Festival has closed. It has been decided to set up a native products market in Beiqiao Town for three days starting on the 21st of this month. Notices have been sent to merchants in various places.</p>
<h3>Yang Hucheng Lingers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yang Hucheng, Director of the Xi'an Pacification Office, has been recuperating in Shanghai for many days. He is currently still at the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road. According to Yang's entourage, Yang is waiting to have his decayed teeth extracted and replaced. However, Yang also suffers from heart disease, and treatment will take time. Therefore, he will stay in Shanghai for many days. It is still difficult to determine when he will return to Shaanxi. The trip to Guangdong has been decided to be cancelled because Chairman Chiang has already returned north and can pay his respects in Nanjing in the future.</p>
<h3>Lime Exempt from Production Tax; Tax Affairs Department Orders Compliance</h3>
<p>According to news from the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, lime is made from limestone and is actually a kind of refined product, which is different from pure ore. It should be exempt from mineral production tax. The Ministry of Finance has issued a notice to all tax collection agencies to comply with this order, thereby benefiting the livelihood of the poor.</p>
<h3>British, American, French, and Japanese Warships Gather in Shanghai; Total of Three Naval Commanders; Ten Thousand Naval Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that many warships will sail into the port of Shanghai in the next few days. The number will be the largest since 1932, like an international naval base. However, the authorities quickly stated that this has nothing to do with the tense situation in Shanghai. Tomorrow (October 1st), the American cruiser Augusta, carrying Rear Admiral Murphy, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will be the first to arrive. Following Shanghai are the French cruisers Lamotte-Picquet and Admiral Charnier, which are expected to arrive from Qingdao around October 7th and are ordered to stay in Shanghai for a month. There is currently a French gunboat in the harbor. At that time, the entire U.S. Asiatic Fleet, except for one or two ships being repaired in Manila, can arrive in port one after another. The fleet includes the cruiser Black Hawk and eleven destroyers, as well as a submarine tender and six submarines. It is also reported that the British 10,000-ton cruiser Cumberland has recently been renovated in the United Kingdom and has been completed. It can also arrive in Shanghai in mid-October. The British cruiser Kent can arrive in port on October 7th first and is planned to be moored at the British naval pontoon. By October 14th, the position will be vacated to allow the British aircraft carrier Hermes. The British cruiser Duncan, currently docked in the port, will leave Shanghai after the Kent arrives. There are currently nine Japanese warships in the port. It is reported that they will be stationed for a long time. Therefore, after the American, French, and British ships arrive, Shanghai will have about 10,000 naval officers and soldiers, which is rare in the port of Shanghai. It is heard that the newly appointed Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, will arrive in Shanghai in late October to take office. At that time, there will be three naval commanders in Shanghai, because French Fleet Commander Admiral Esteva will also arrive in Shanghai on the French cruiser Lamotte-Picquet. The U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment and naval officers stationed in Shanghai have scheduled a dance party at the Race Club around the end of October. In addition, several groups are also preparing welcome events. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Exercised on Tongji Road Yesterday; No Significant Movement of Japanese Troops in Various Places; Fewer Japanese Troops Patrolling</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the situation in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas yesterday was as peaceful as usual. However, around 10 AM, more than 100 Japanese marines exercised at the vacant lot of Doi Garden on Tongji Road for about an hour. At that time, there were a few Japanese soldiers on guard on Tongji Road, but they were withdrawn in the afternoon. The Japanese troops at the Jiangwan Road Huayuan Street bottom square and the Tanaya brewery have not yet withdrawn. At the Japanese defense posts in front of the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road and at the intersection of D'Este Wei Road and Qimei Road, one armored vehicle and one military truck, two motorcycle are stationed in front of each post. Japanese troops are also stationed at the Ouyang Road Japanese Women's School defense post. There are fewer Japanese soldiers patrolling the roads than before.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Leases Datong Steamer to Restore Shanghai-Yichang Route; Approved to First Sail from Shanghai on October 2nd; Trial Run for One Month to Determine Contract Based on Performance</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau's plan to restore the Shanghai-Yichang line has been successful. It has leased the Datong fast steamer from Yixiang Shipping Company and is approved to sail on October 2nd. The details are as follows:</p>

For the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in addition to sending the Kuailey steamer (1,293 gross tons, 879 net tons) to run the Hankou-Yichang line, the Yichang-Chongqing line and the Shanghai-Yichang line have been temporarily abandoned. General Manager Cai Zengmou has made every effort to plan the restoration and has been successful. The Shanghai-Yichang line will be restored first.</p>
<p>Leasing Steamer for Operation: The China Merchants Bureau has leased the Datong steamer from Yixiang Shipping Bureau, stating that it will first conduct a trial run for one month. If the speed and other factors are good, a formal contract will be signed. The steamer is 1,096 gross tons, 640 net tons, has a speed of 9 nautical miles per hour, was built in Shanghai in 1891, and has 480 horsepower. It is now approved to sail from Shanghai to Yichang for the first time on October 2nd, stopping at Hankou and Shashi.

<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement previously announced a house tax assessment, which has caused dissatisfaction among residents.

Therefore, the Bureau is re-issuing an announcement for public knowledge. The original text reads: "For Announcement Matters: It is hereby announced that any taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the rental value assessed for the collection of house tax may, within thirty days of receiving the valuation notice from this Bureau, obtain the prescribed appeal form from the Donation and Tax Section, complete it, and submit it to this Bureau to appeal to the House Rental Valuation Appeal Committee.

<h3>Public Notarization Activities in the First Special District Court Over the Past Two Months</h3>
<p>The establishment of a public notary office is to confirm the establishment of the people's legal acts and the occurrence of facts concerning private rights, so as to prevent legal disputes and reduce the people's litigation burden. This system has long been implemented in European and American countries and Japan. The First Special District Local Court of this city, following the order of the Ministry of Justice, established a notary office on August 1 of this year. It has been two months since then. However, according to the provisional rules for public notarization, if the person requesting public notarization does not know the public notary office judge, he or she should first submit a certificate from the district chief, chamber of commerce, or police chief, or prove that the requester is the person with a witness known to the judge. This regulation, before the household registration survey is fully implemented, greatly hinders the promotion of the public notarization system. The Ministry of Justice issued an order to the courts handling public notarization in August of this year, stating that the court may send personnel to investigate and report. If the requester is actually the person, it will also be considered to have the effect of proof. After the implementation of this method, merchants and the public felt it was convenient. Therefore, many people have recently gone to apply for notarization. It is heard that the court authorities are preparing to print a Public Notarization Guide for the general public to understand the public notarization system. That is, the main provisions of the Public Notarization Rules will be divided into outlines, listing the organization of the public notarization agency and the procedures for applying for notarization, etc., compiled into a table, striving for simplicity, so that readers can understand it at a glance. This expression has been sent to the printer. Also, because the public notarization system is being tested, some people may not fully understand what kind of legal acts, due to facts concerning private rights, should be requested for public notarization or can be requested for public notarization. The public is referred to the order of the articles of the Civil and Commercial Laws and a table listing the items that can be requested for public notarization will be made.</p>
<h3>Scenery Unchanged: Yesterday Competed to Appreciate the Festival; Silver Shops and Factories All on Holiday; Amusement Parks and Movie Theaters Packed</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the old calendar. The silver shops all followed the tradition of taking a holiday, and the exchanges also stopped trading.

The shop assistants served the hosts and guests, running back and forth, appearing to be exhausted. At the same time, some hospitals also closed for the festival, such as the Baolong Hospital, which stopped seeing patients in the afternoon. Amusement parks and movie theaters took advantage of the holiday to stage new plays or show new movies to attract customers. There was a welcoming crowd. But if one looks at the tense situation on North Sichuan Road and Zhabei Baziqiao, do the residents also have a feeling that the scenery is unchanged, and that they are looking at mountains and rivers?</p>

<h3>French Franc Devaluation; French Merchants Stop Buying Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been on the market for two weeks. Cocoon shops have successively collected and weighed cocoons. Because overseas silk sales have been sluggish this year, silk merchants are mostly pessimistic about the silk industry. According to reporter investigations, last week, before the devaluation of the French franc, French silk merchants frequently purchased cocoons. After the devaluation of the French franc, French merchants stopped buying Chinese silk. Although the president of the American Silk Industry Association, Mr. Qian Li, expressed his appreciation for Chinese silk in the United States, because Chinese silk has no ability to promote sales in the international market and is no match for the dumping policy of Japanese silk, there has been no progress. However, American silk merchants are quite satisfied with the quality of Chinese silk, and the future may gradually move into a better situation. As for the current price of silk, it is still around 650 yuan. Chinese silk merchants have lower cocoon collection costs, so if Chinese silk has sales, the profits are still quite high.</p>

<h3>Woman Accuses Husband of Assault: Examination Reveals No Injuries, Dares to Bribe Doctor; Court Now Initiates Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>A woman, Pan Zhang, aged forty-eight, recently filed a lawsuit against her husband, Pan Yuqi, and others for assault.

<h3>Ox Escapes Slaughterhouse: Squeals to Improvement Society; Strange Tale Before Animal Day</h3>
<p>In the Xiyingfangqiao area, west of the Seventh Bridge on Hu-Min Road, which is within the boundary of Songjiang County, a shrew, Ma Jin, gathered hooligans to privately slaughter oxen. By chance, the smell of blood reached the village. On the evening of the 29th of last month, an ox (a yellow cow) awaiting slaughter at Ma Jin's slaughterhouse bit through its tether and ran to the front of the Zhuanqiao Township Rural Improvement Society on Jianshe Road, squealing incessantly. A passerby, Xu Jinsheng, found the situation strange and stepped forward to hold the ox's rope, preventing it from running away. He also woke up the staff of the Improvement Society, explaining the situation. Zhang Yi, the chairman of the Improvement Society, instructed Ru Xiaojiang to temporarily care for the ox. Upon hearing this, the ox seemed to express joy. Later, a farmer, He Ruitang, bought the ox from Ma Jin and took it home to raise. The ox leaped and called out endlessly.

<p>Zhao Xingxi, a local resident of Yongshou Lane, No. A6, Lane 584, Xiafei Road, French Concession, aged forty-one, previously worked as a compradore at the Anli Foreign Firm, accumulating considerable wealth. Because he had no sons, he took Mao Aba, the eldest daughter of Mao Weiqing, the accounting clerk of the Anqing Steamer, as a concubine five years ago through a matchmaker. After she entered the household, she lived peacefully with the first wife. However, recently, their relationship soured. On the 18th of last month, Aba took advantage of an opportunity to steal two deposit slips from Zhao Xingxi's accounts at the Bank of China branch and Wing On Company, exchanging them for 3,100 yuan in cash. She absconded without a trace, taking their daughter, Meizhen, with her. Zhao searched everywhere and reported the matter to the police. He also hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special Court against his concubine, Mao Aba, seeking to terminate their cohabitation relationship. The court accepted the lawsuit, and yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu presided over the hearing in Civil Court 7. The defendant could not be reached, so only the plaintiff and his lawyer appeared in court, recounting the previous events. They requested permission for a one-sided argument and a judgment of separation.

<h3>Wife Catches Husband in Adultery: Husband Angered and Commits Violence</h3>
<p>Xu Shannan, a Bao Shan native in his thirties and owner of the Xu Da Shun Cotton Shop at 62 Ximen Road, Taiping Bridge, French Concession, married Wang (the same age as Xu) from Suzhou in 1925 through a matchmaker. They lived together harmoniously for 11 years. Recently, Xu had an affair with Gong Qilan, a local woman (25 years old), and rented a room at No. 15, Alley 946, Albert Road, living there with her. His attitude towards Wang changed abruptly and he often did not return home at night. At the end of last month, Wang discovered that her husband was committing adultery and cohabitating with Gong. She gathered two female friends and went to catch them in the act. Xu, seeing his wife, became enraged and beat her. Wang reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Xu and Gong. After investigation, only a public prosecution for assault was filed against Xu Shannan. The portion of the case of Gong Qilan endangering the family was not prosecuted because the procedures were not in accordance. Xu Wang hired a lawyer and went to the criminal court of the Second Special Court and submitted a private prosecution for Gong Qilan for endangering the family and requested the law to punish Gong in accordance with Article 239 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the lawsuit, and yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing in Criminal Court 2. Both parties complied with the summons and appeared in court.

<h3>Yang Wendao et al.: Extended Detention for Two Months; Court Delivered Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cantonese Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong are suspected of having been involved in the shooting death of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Baole An Road on the night of November 9 last year. They were arrested by the Public Police and prosecuted for murder in the First Special Court. Because the case was complicated and the investigation of evidence took a considerable amount of time, the trials were repeatedly opened, but could not be concluded.

Yesterday, the court made a second ruling to extend the detention period for two months. The order has been delivered to the defendants and their defense lawyers yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Runs Over and Kills Police Officer: Driver Ordered to Pay Damages; Compensation for Corpse Belongs to Damage 1,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Fu Yu, a policeman at the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei, was ordered to deliver official documents to the headquarters in May of this year. While riding his bicycle on the way to the intersection of Xinzha Road and Chi Bang Road, he was hit by a Route 10 public bus coming head-on. He was knocked down and crushed to death. After the police investigation, it was believed that the driver, Wang Jinfa, was not at fault and would not be prosecuted. The head of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai Jingjun, thought that human life was of the utmost importance. He couldn't accept a resolution before the court could rule on whether the driver was at fault. So he commissioned the legal consultant of the Bureau, lawyer Zhan Jifeng, to represent the family of the deceased and file a private prosecution with the criminal court of the First Special Court. After the trial, Wang Jinfa was found to be responsible for the death caused by negligence. He was sentenced to six months in prison. Wang did not accept the sentence and appealed to the Second High Court. The appeal was rejected and the judgment has been confirmed. Then lawyer Zhan represented the family of the deceased and filed a lawsuit for damages against Wang Jinfa in the court of first instance. Judge Tao summoned the parties several times. The decision was announced yesterday. Wang Jinfa should compensate the plaintiff, Fu Zhu, with 1,500 yuan of the national currency. The litigation costs are borne by the defendant. The aforementioned compensation amount should be subject to provisional execution.</p>

<h3>Huang Lijuan Sues Kong Zuan at Special Court 2; Demands 30,000+ Gold for Living Expenses; Special Court 1 Approves Withdrawal of Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Kong Zuan, a minor owner of the Renhe Weaving Factory on Beile Road, French Concession, was previously sued in the Second Special Court by Huang Lijuan, a young woman from Hunan, along with her four-year-old child, for seduction and abandonment. Because the location of the crime was in the Public Concession, the case was transferred to the First Special Court. After examination, it was ruled that Kong Zuan, for failing to provide the necessary care and protection for the livelihood of a person without the ability to save themself, was sentenced to six months in prison with a one-year suspension. All other parts of the verdict were not guilty. All of this has already been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is learned that Huang Lijuan, still engaging lawyer Hu Yongde, has filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special Court against Kong Zuan, requesting that he be ordered to pay for living expenses and the education of the child born with Kong, totaling more than 30,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu presided over the hearing in Civil Court 7. The defendant did not arrive. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit, requesting that the defendant Kong Zuan be ordered to pay Huang Lijuan a monthly living allowance of 60 yuan until she turns 60 years old, and a monthly education and support fee of 40 yuan for the child, who is currently four years old, until he turns 20 years old, totaling more than 36,000 yuan. The court reasoned that the defendant's address was in the French Concession, so the Second Special Court should handle the case. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested to withdraw the lawsuit and file another lawsuit in the Second Special Court. The court approved the request.</p>

<h3>Financial Observers on the Franc Devaluation</h3>
<p>According to New News Agency, since the French currency devaluation has been realized, its financial relationship with our country has been repeatedly recorded in the newspapers. New News Agency reporters have also collected general opinions from economists and bankers from all aspects. All agree that the French government's currency devaluation, the implementation of leaving the gold standard, and the implementation of the new economic policy are the steps that should be taken to cope with the current international financial situation and domestic financial panic. This is because the difficulties and losses suffered by the national finance and domestic economy because of the French government's past practice of maintaining the value of the French franc to avoid losses to the general petty-bourgeois class and those who rely on salaries can no longer be tolerated. To put it simply, it cannot be denied that the gold standard can no longer adapt to the current international economic environment. At the current international financial situation, the changes caused by the devaluation of the French franc are indeed a very important issue. However, the degree of its evolution cannot be predicted. From a superficial observation, if the new currency agreement between Britain, the United States, and France can be well-maintained by the three countries, it should not put international finance in danger. It is well known that the economic power of Britain, the United States, and France can control the entire economic action of Europe and the United States. As for the direct and indirect relationship between my country's financial situation and the international financial changes, although the currency has no ties with the currency of any country, it will not be affected. It can also benefit from the joint stabilization of international finance by European and American countries. Therefore, the reasons for the ups and downs in the gold market in recent days, although not without shadow, are mostly caused by the speculation of general speculators. This kind of improper market cannot last.</p>

After the social gathering, they left Beijing on the 11:00 PM overnight express train and returned to Shanghai. They arrived in the city at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. After getting off the train, they returned to the consulate on Jing'an Temple Road. Starting yesterday morning, Maxander Laysky officially took office. They are scheduled to pay visits to Mayor Wu, Director Zhou of the Foreign Affairs Department's Shanghai Office, the consuls of various countries in Shanghai, and the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the next few days. Osdovan is scheduled to leave Shanghai by boat on the 5th, passing through Mumbai, India, and returning home to take office.</p>
<h3>Medical Association Releases Survey on Workers' Diets</h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association has released a report on a survey of workers' diets conducted by physicians from the Department of Physiology at the Lester Institute of Medical Research. The material is based on the results of a survey of seven factories in Shanghai, their employees, and their families. In addition, three types of non-factory employees were surveyed, namely, technical workers, hospital employees, and patients, for comparison. The following is an excerpt from the contents of the report: (1) The diets of ten types of factory workers were surveyed, and the results were compared with the results of surveys of the diets of two types of non-factory employees and several types of patients. (2) The results of the survey found that the diets of child laborers, both in terms of quality and quantity, were below the standard required levels and were worse than the diets of other types of workers in Shanghai. (3) The results of the survey found that the diets of workers contained too many carbohydrates, resulting in an imbalance and insufficient nutrition. (4) The diets of workers contained insufficient amounts of animal fat and animal protein, and the quality of the animal fat they consumed was poor. (6) Regarding the mineral content of the diets of workers in Shanghai, the results of the survey showed that it was very suitable for adults, but for child laborers, the content of noodles and phosphorus was insufficient. (6) The results of the survey found that the diets of workers in Shanghai lacked good quality fat, so vitamins must also be lacking. (7) The weight and height of workers in Shanghai, compared with students in Shanghai, clearly showed that workers were malnourished. Compared with other races, the physique of these workers was similar to that of the malnourished people in tropical regions such as Sri Lanka and Africa who ate vegetables.</p>
<h3>Brothers Settle Inheritance Dispute Out of Court</h3>
<p>Lu Zhongfu, the late Chinese manager of the real estate department of the British firm Tyrie, had a great deal of property, which was divided among his children. After the division, Lu's children, Lu Zhangci and Lu Fengqin, alleged that one unit located at the corner of Guiyang Road, Yangshupu, had not been publicly divided and had been seized and sold by their eldest brother, Lu Zhangde. They hired lawyer Chen Yun to file a lawsuit against their brother Zhangde for encroachment. The First Special Court had already summoned the parties once. All details were reported in this newspaper on the 25th of last month. At the previous hearing, Lu Zhangde claimed that the land was given to him by his late father during his lifetime and presented a deed of property transfer written by his uncle, Lu Wenbin, as proof. Lu Zhangci later discovered that the handwriting on the deed was clear and fresh, which was suspicious. He invited his uncle, Lu Wenbin, to his home. Lu Wenbin claimed that Lu Zhangde had forced him to create the deed with a pistol. Lawyer Chen Yun then filed a request with the court for investigation. Since the occurrence of this case, the relatives of the Lu family, considering that they were brothers, could not endure a family feud, so they came forward to mediate and a settlement was reached. At 1:00 PM yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened a hearing in Criminal Court 5. The plaintiff's lawyer Chen Su declared that a settlement had been reached and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit. After Judge Pan reviewed the evidence and determined that it was true, he approved the withdrawal of the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Car Stolen Yesterday</h3>
<p>Case No. 11022</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a black-plated private car with concession case number 11022 was stolen and disappeared in the Public Concession. The owner of the car immediately reported the incident to the police, who ordered all district police stations to investigate and notified the Chinese and French police authorities to assist in the investigation.</p>
<h3>The Reasons for China's Economic Backwardness</h3>
<p>— Zong Hua</p>
<p>The development of China's economy is currently lingering at a crossroads between handicraft production and mechanical industrial construction. Compared to advanced countries, it is backward, a fact that is widely acknowledged. However, the reasons for China's economic backwardness are viewed differently by everyone.</p>
<p>But broadly speaking, there are two schools of thought:</p>
<p>(1)  Imperialist economic aggression and the dumping of foreign goods into China destroyed the development of China's national industries.</p>
<p>(2)  Poor transportation, deep-rooted conservative thinking, and especially years of internal strife, have prevented China's economy from developing.</p>
<p>Both of these views have their merits. However, we must understand that if the first explanation is absolutely correct, then before the Opium War, China's social productivity did not develop either and was only able to be self-sufficient or semi-self-sufficient. This cannot be blamed on the evils of imperialism in any way, but should be attributed to the second factor. At the same time, conversely, if the second explanation is absolutely correct, then Shanghai and its surrounding areas, as well as the areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, should have experienced smooth and prosperous industrial development, without the risk of bankruptcy or closure. The opposite is true, which cannot be denied as the evil of imperialist economic aggression. From a comprehensive perspective, China's economic backwardness is two-sided: external oppression and internal constraints are intertwined, causing China's economic development to advance one step and retreat one step.</p>
<p>(1)  The opening of ports and the dumping of foreign goods into China could have stimulated the launch of China's national industries. Due to the reflection of foreign investment and the alignment of modern trends with the psychology of emerging figures, China's industrialization ideology has become increasingly strong. However, the opposite is also true. The dumping of technologically advanced foreign goods is sufficient to destroy the development of China's national industries. The explicit provisions in the Treaty of Shimonoseki between China and Japan, which allowed foreigners to establish factories in coastal ports at will, allowed foreigners to manipulate and dominate the development of China's national industries. As a result, the more China's industry developed, the more China's people went bankrupt. At the same time, the process of colonization deepened, and the people could not benefit from it. The process of China's industrialization was just beginning.</p>
<p>(2)  Poor transportation and deep-rooted conservative thinking could have created a convenient situation for the promotion of Chinese domestic goods. Years of internal strife should have deterred foreign investors and created a military boom for national industries due to the needs of war. However, the opposite is again true. Although conservative thinking in psychology is strong, the idea of cheap and high-quality goods is instead eye-catching. As a result, foreign goods can travel to remote areas without hindrance, despite poor transportation, while China's inherent handicrafts have been defeated. At the same time, during the civil war, foreign merchants, backed by treaty guarantees of military support, had no scruples about the tyranny of feudal warlords. They could instead take the opportunity to develop their power (such as the improved business of Jardine Matheson and Swire's ships during the civil war) or annex and buy out domestic factories (during the civil war, Chinese people were often happy to be able to sell their factories and recover their capital). Even arms trading with warlords and the military boom created opportunities for foreigners. The so-called industrial development of China has become the development of foreign power.</p>
<p>These two processes have a common trend: after the opening of ports, China's industry developed, but foreign power developed even more. In other words, China's industrial development is colonial in nature. Therefore, development reaches a certain stage and is then destroyed and shrinks by external forces. However, compared to the static society of closed doors, there is already a completely different feeling. The national stage can no longer move forward, so it is clearly backward.</p>
<p>Judging from this, we can see that the reason for China's economic backwardness cannot be entirely blamed on the dumping of foreign goods. The dumping of foreign goods can stimulate the development of China's national industries. Nor can it be said that the dumping of foreign goods has no impact on China, because at least it has restricted the development of China's national industries to a certain stage. In addition to the above reasons, there are still main reasons for China's economic backwardness. This is what the other faction believes, that poor transportation and years of internal strife are the reasons. This will be explained below:</p>
<p>(1)  Poor transportation isolates China's inland areas from cities, like two different worlds. Therefore, industrial development cannot be universal as a result. As a result, it has only become a distorted and one-sided Westernization, that is, the so-called consumption chooses foreign goods. In terms of production, the cost of transportation from the inland to the city is even more expensive than transportation from overseas to China. Therefore, from the comparison of the cost theory of merchants, economic development is considered unnecessary. Economic backwardness has its origins.</p>
<p>Years of internal strife drove capital to flee to the cities, making land speculation one way to invest. Or depositing money in banks and using banks as a transition to invest in public bonds for a parasitic life of usury. That is what the world calls the concentration of hot money in cities. Therefore, production cannot develop, and China's economy can only regress.</p>
<p>These two reasons are greater than the impact of the dumping of foreign goods. The internal self-destruction is a major reason for China's economic backwardness.</p>
<p>Those who question this may say: these so-called internal constraints, such as war and internal strife, are still the result of the imperialist economic aggression and the dumping of foreign goods destroying the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, internal strife is connected to external disasters. I used to agree with this view. Now, I have some reservations. Internal strife is a product of Chinese history and did not begin after the opening of ports. Moreover, even if what you say is true, imperialists can only manipulate the existence of a separatist situation and cannot directly advocate the existence of a separatist situation. Without internal strife, where would external disasters come from? In the final analysis, China's internal strife is self-inflicted by the Chinese people. China's economic backwardness should also be attributed to the account of internal strife that has been self-inflicted by the Chinese people. Placing full responsibility on imperialism is acceptable for shifting blame. However, it is not acceptable for exploring the reasons for economic backwardness and proposing practical remedies. Therefore, to sum it up in an old saying, the greatest prerequisite for developing China's economy is to ensure long-term security in the inland.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Tragedy by Nietzsche: The Rise and Fall of Gonorrhea in Europe</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>...In two years, more than 60 anti-gonorrhea groups were organized to work hard...Definitive treatment strategies for gonorrhea were established, and every venereal disease hospital was ordered to strictly comply.</p>
<p>Because China is a nation that values physical education, gonorrhea is far less rampant than in Western countries. Anyone who pays attention to Western customs and conditions knows that Europe holds a strong and progressive view of sexual desire. Especially in ancient times, syphilis and gonorrhea were prevalent among them. Although they were common and easily seen at the time, they did not know that these were two different diseases, often thinking that the latter was a mild form of the former.</p>
<p>The term syphilis was not coined until the fifteenth century. It is said that Nietzsche, the literary giant who advocated the theory of the will to power and shone a unique brilliance in the German ideological world, was also attacked by this disease. Li Pandok said that he had this disease after reading his book "The Birth of Tragedy." However, at this time, gonorrhea was still considered a special symptom of syphilis. Since Neisser discovered gonococcus in 1879, the general understanding of gonorrhea and its treatment methods have had a correct goal. However, many of the treatments are not yet good. The failure of the transmucosal sterilization therapy is because it only cares about the local area and does not care about the gonorrhea in the body.</p>
<p>Seeing that gonorrhea is becoming more and more rampant, various European countries have launched a general union of the European medical community to organize anti-gonorrhea groups. According to news from the press, they have organized more than 60 groups in two years to work together to eradicate gonorrhea. The only weapon they trust to eliminate gonorrhea is the protein chromophore preparation "Kelinon." Originally, Kelinon was the crystallization of Dr. Bided's 28 years of research in Germany. The doctor is the authority on European gonorrhea. All other gonorrhea experts and medical doctors who created gonorrhea drugs are students of Biede. Therefore, regardless of the emergence of gonorrhea drugs like mushrooms after rain, the governments of various countries still unanimously strive to promote "Kelinon," and order all venereal disease hospitals in Europe to strictly comply with the implementation of this agent. Therefore, the treatment of gonorrhea with "Kelinon" has become a classic treasure. (Daonan's note: After graduating from Moscow Labor Medical University in Russia, I served as the director of the Genitourinary Hospital in Moscow. All men and women with acute and chronic gonorrhea and joint true orchitis, etc., were cured by me. However, for leucorrhea in women, it is better to use "Carter's" vaginal suppositories at the same time!</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate the Disease of Indulgence and Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Many ignorant young people often get married due to sexual impulses and the temptation of bad friends, or because their parents are eager to have grandchildren, so they let immature young people get married to fulfill their wishes. How can they know that indulgence harms the body, making the ejaculatory tube and erection nerves fragile and losing their healthy structure, so the suffering of nocturnal emission suddenly comes. And gradually develops into premature ejaculation habits. If it is a case of nocturnal emission that is not deep, taking "Nels Nocturnal Emission Pills" is most effective. This pill can calm the nerves, consolidate the sperm gate, and prevent the pain of semen escaping for no reason. I used this pill to treat a young man surnamed Fang. He suffered from nocturnal emission due to excessive masturbation. Fortunately, he was treated early. I taught him to take this pill according to the law. In less than three weeks, the bad habit of masturbation stopped and never occurred again, so the bad habit was quit, and the suffering of nocturnal emission was also cured. However, the symptoms of memorizing pictures and dizziness were not eliminated. This was caused by neurasthenia caused by masturbation. He was instructed to take "Butikang" for about two weeks and was cured. He is now studying at university, and he is always at the top of the list in every test.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Consultation Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Negligence in Transforming Gonorrhea</p>
<p>What is called an unexpected disaster is a misfortune that comes without cause. For example, most gonorrhea patients start from prostitution. This is the result of one's own carelessness. However, patients know that the disease has the danger of infecting the opposite sex and do not cherish their wives. They often unintentionally transmit gonorrhea to her. If the wife is infected with gonorrhea and is not cured, she may unintentionally contaminate the child's eyes with leucorrhea, resulting in blindness. Gonorrhea, which can be cured, is only neglected and not treated, resulting in an unexpected disaster for his wife. It is truly heartbreaking to say.</p>
<p>Originally, gonococcus has strong anti-toxic power and is highly contagious. Even one accidental contact can transmit it, not to mention husband and wife sharing the same bed? According to my statistics from the past ten years of clinical practice, all married patients, 100% of wives and children, have gonorrheal leucorrhea. Here is an example of a patient named Kuang Jingyin, who lives in a lane on Shanxi Road. After prostitution, he contracted gonorrhea. He did not seek medical treatment and hid it from his wife, causing his wife to also contract severe gonorrhea. A child was born and became blind shortly after, and soon died young. The couple was very sad. Later, she became pregnant again. Fearing that they would repeat the same mistake, they decided to ask me for treatment. After diagnosis, I knew that he had also developed chronic prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis. I immediately gave him German "Kelinon" to scour the gonococcus in the depths of the lesion, surround it, and kill it. I also used X-rays and electrotherapy to maximize the sterilization power of "Kelinon." In less than four weeks, the inflammation subsided, the pain stopped, and the urine became clear. However, after checking with a microscope, there was a slight gonorrhea system. He continued to take it for more than ten days and was completely cured. In addition to taking "Kelinon" internally, his wife used "Carter's Vaginal Suppositories" as a suppository. She also recovered in four weeks. Not long after, she gave birth to a child who was fat and cute and had no disease.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Nanyang</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Graduate of Japanese Imperial Medical University</p>
<p>Freedom of marriage, public love under the coconut trees</p>
<p>As the wind of lust intensifies, sexually transmitted diseases are becoming more prevalent.</p>
<p>The race is weakening, but fortunately, the authorities have made appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>The Gayas are a relatively uncivilized people in Nanyang. They have a peculiar custom, which is that men and women have intercourse in the daytime instead of at night, in the wild forest instead of in the house. They use fragrant grass as a cushion and the forest as a curtain. Their reason is that it is not clear at night, and children are pestering them in the house. We often see pairs of lovers singing and dancing enthusiastically under the coconut trees in that beautiful scenery of blue sky and dark sea. This kind of eroticism is intoxicating to anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Due to their early maturity, miscegenation, and indulgence, they all suffer from a common sexually transmitted disease, that is, incomplete development of the genitals and the prevalence of nocturnal emission. Therefore, men in their twenties show signs of aging. Fortunately, the Dutch authorities have paid attention to this and sent personnel to investigate and take appropriate measures. The year before last, I traveled to Nanyang with Dr. Gauss from Germany. He also expressed strangeness when he saw the sexual life of the people in this place. Later, we Westerners lived in the home of a local so-called gentleman. This gentleman looked about fifty years old and spoke English. There were many people in the family, especially women, about twenty years old. After living there for a few days, we figured it all out. It turned out that most of these men were hired workers, and most of the women were his wives and concubines. There were only two daughters. (They don't necessarily need sons.) He was actually only thirty years old. Later, they also knew that we were doctors, so he asked us to see him and described his symptoms in fluent English, saying that his illness started with nocturnal emission, but he still did not know how to restrain himself and was immersed in alcohol and sex every day. Therefore, he went from nocturnal emission to ridiculousness, often ejaculating before even touching a woman's body. Symptoms such as headache, insomnia, backache, and forgetfulness were increasing every day. This is obviously sexual neurasthenia. He was told to take "Butikang." Later, he bought two dozen in Singapore. Before he finished taking them, he was completely cured. He also looked much younger, only like thirty years old. It can be said that he was completely different before and after. This is entirely because "Butikang" is made with hormones from strong animals, and its effectiveness is great and lasting. All men who masturbate excessively or engage in excessive sexual activity can take it for incomplete development, sexual neurasthenia, etc., and can be cured in one month. The treatment of the Gaya gentleman's disease has already been made into a paper by Dr. Gauss and published in the Asian Medical Journal, Volume 17, Issue 12. Therefore, "Butikang" has won the honor of being adopted by physicians all over the world.</p>
<h3>New Trends in Europe and America for the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<p>From the Overthrow of Superficial Treatments Like Phlegm Reduction and Cough Suppression to the Advocacy of Surgical Procedures, Creating the Newest Oral Medications by Gathering Opinions from Two Thousand Tuberculosis Experts</p>
<p>Dr. Deng's Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road Consultation Hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis has undergone countless evolutions to reach its newest form today. Naturally, this is due to the rapid advancement of 20th-century science. Those superficial treatments for pulmonary tuberculosis, such as phlegm reduction and cough suppression, which are not practical drug therapies, are now completely discarded. Anyone with basic medical knowledge must know that the latest trend in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in modern European countries is artificial pneumothorax, which was successfully researched by Saugmann V., Muron Brauer, and others, as well as Dr. Sauerbruch's phrenic nerve resection, and thoracoplasty, which was improved by Sauerbruch. Although these treatments belong to surgery, their purpose and effect are to keep the diseased lung still and quiet, and to promote the proliferation of calcareous material in the affected area to encapsulate the tubercle bacilli. On the other hand, due to the decrease in respiratory function caused by pulmonary tuberculosis, the supply of oxygen to the lesion tissue can be reduced, and the tubercle bacilli will lose their ability to survive.</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty of performing surgery and the need for patients to have a suitable environment, drug treatment has gradually and subtly re-established its power in recent years. About two thousand or more tuberculosis experts from Germany, Guangdong, and Switzerland gathered opinions and believed that based on the principles of the efficacy of the above-mentioned surgical treatments, oral medications could be produced to achieve the practical benefits of surgical treatment and avoid the risks of surgery. In 1910, Dr. Meyer York invented calcium preparations, which can increase the calcareous material in the lungs and have been widely praised by scholars. Later, Dr. Tuomei, a famous Swiss pulmonologist, improved his drug, gathered wisdom and created "Bufei Na'er," a drug used for various symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in men and women, such as hemoptysis, cough, expectoration, chest pain, fever, night sweats, etc., and it has special efficacy. This is how lung disease treatment transitioned to this latest new stage. Originally, the pharmacological action of "Bufei Na'er" can shrink the respiratory function of the affected lung, reduce oxygen, supply calcareous material, and give the tubercle bacilli a great setback! Therefore, its effectiveness has been highly praised by famous doctors all over the world. If patients also suffer from neurasthenia, insomnia, emaciation, male spermatorrhea and impotence, or female menstrual disorders, they can simultaneously take "Buti Kang" for men and "Bunu Rong" for women, which will naturally invigorate the spirit or easily increase weight.</p>
<h3>Chlorosis in Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>What are the causes?</p>
<p>How to cure it radically? What are the dangers of not treating it?</p>
<p>The main cause of chlorosis in women is nothing more than the dysfunction of the uterus and ovaries. We often see women with irregular menstruation, neurasthenia, and poor breast development suffering from this disease. Their complexion is sallow, their lips and nails are pale, and their limbs are tired, presenting a state of extreme anemia. Moreover, due to irregular menstruation, there is often palpitation, back pain, weak legs, leucorrhea, abdominal distension or stabbing pain. Pleasure is reduced, and they are often infertile after prolonged marriage.</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lun of Germany, an authority in endocrinology in the 20th century, invented "Buti Kang" for men and "Bunu Rong" for women, which are new contributions to science. The drug "Bunu Rong" has indeed remarkable effects on chlorosis among women's diseases. Because it can regulate ovarian function, correct uterine physiology, and also promote breast development. When I was studying at Nanyang Medical University, I read a paper by Dr. Luke, a medical doctor from Greece (Professor of Gynecology at the University of Edinburgh), who said that he used the drug "Bunu Rong" to cure a 28-year-old unmarried woman with chlorosis, whose symptoms were complicated, as described above. After five weeks of treatment, she was completely cured. Since I established my own hospital after graduation, I have used "Bunu Rong" to cure hundreds of people with this disease. For those with leucorrhea, I also use "Ka's Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Following this treatment method, every patient can also treat themselves without having to seek the door of a doctor.</p>
<h3>The Dangerous Signs of Urethral Stricture and Infiltration</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Reduction of Urethral Longitudinal Folds Difficult Urination</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang Chongdao, 31 years old, suffered from gonorrhea and repeatedly relapsed, resulting in urethral stricture and infiltration of chronic posterior urethritis. When examined with a urethroscope, the infiltrated part could not detect the longitudinal folds of the mucosa, and completely lost its healthy state. The epithelial mucosa occasionally fell off and became eroded, and the corpus cavernosum was closed (as shown in Figure 1). Urination was extremely difficult, so he often suffered from uremia due to urine retention, resulting in loss of consciousness, which was quite dangerous. Friend Mr. Fang Shun'an discussed with me to rescue him, so I performed surgery to drain the urine to relieve his urgency, and then prescribed German "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, prevent corrosion, and promote urination. After three weeks, the disease had greatly improved, and urination was quick and easy. Re-examination with a urethroscope showed that the longitudinal folds gradually increased, but had not yet fully recovered to a healthy state. I still instructed him to continue taking "Kelinong" for another week, and then examined him with a urethroscope, and the longitudinal folds had increased to a healthy state (as shown in Figure 2). According to this case, if he is not urgently treated, it will always lead to proliferation of connective tissue and loss of urethral elasticity, and even death from uremia. It is also a dangerous symptom in gonorrhea.</p>

<h3>The Misfortune of People with Indigestion</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>…Detailed Description of Various Pathological Conditions of Stomach Yang Obstruction… Appetite is the Most Important Condition for Health and Should Not Be Neglected</p>
<p>Professor Coulber, a biologist, once said that the first condition for the survival of organisms is diet. They must have sufficient nutrition to prolong their lives. Conversely, they will wither and be unable to resist nature. This is an eternal truth. Just look at the strong and healthy people among humans, they all have a large appetite. This proves that people with good digestion must have rich nutrition and strong physical strength. In medicine, strength is essential, otherwise, it is a pathological condition. Therefore, people with indigestion have signs of pathological changes in stomach yang. In the initial stage, people often do not realize it. When the disease deepens, vomiting, nausea, acid reflux, belching, etc., follow. Some develop stomach pain, and some worsen into massive hematemesis from gastric ulcers, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>After graduating from the Army Medical University, I served as a military doctor for many years. Soldiers suffered from many gastrointestinal diseases due to coarse tea and rough food. I repeatedly used "Qiangwei Jing" for those with the aforementioned stomach diseases, and all achieved rapid results. It is also remarkably effective for constipation, abdominal pain, or excessive drinking of soup and water, and stomach distension. Other symptoms such as bad breath, fear of eating, diarrhea due to cold, and dysentery, will all be cured by taking this medicine.</p>
<h3>A Simple Guide to Coughs</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Prolonged Coughing Weakens the Lungs This Has Become a Golden Rule…How to Save Yourself…Elderly People's Phlegm and Wheezing Are Prone to Recurrence in Autumn…How to Eradicate Them</p>
<p>The dangerousness of cough complications has become a well-known fact. And the most dangerous are pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis. According to the statistics of Kolermoje (an Austrian pulmonologist), on average, 79 out of every 80 people develop pulmonary tuberculosis from colds and coughs. And the cause of pneumonia is 100% due to colds. Pneumonia can cause sudden death, and mild cases will turn into pulmonary tuberculosis. Indeed, if you are not careful in the autumn, you will catch a cough. People with coughs, even if they do not understand how dangerous pneumonia can be, should remember the saying that prolonged coughing injures the internal organs, and think about saving themselves. When I was at Nantong Medical University, after studying the profound theories of Dr. Tuomei, a world-renowned lung disease specialist, I firmly believed in the pharmacological effects of his invented "Bufei Na'er." After graduation, I worked in the West Lake Tuberculosis Hospital and used this medicine to test the effects of relieving coughs and suppressing phlegm in many cases. Especially for elderly people's asthma and phlegm, and children's pertussis, it can achieve special results immediately after taking it. Because it contains egg yolk protein, it is remarkably effective for dry coughs in weak people and after illness, and for smokers' coughs and phlegm.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines have been specifically designated by doctors who have graduated from specialized universities at home and abroad. Be sure to recognize them and purchase them carefully.

<p>Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Weiling: Suffering from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility for many years, back pain, small genitals like fingers, insomnia, etc., you can take "Buti Kang" to invigorate hormones, then the genitals will naturally be healthy, develop perfectly, and all symptoms will disappear immediately. However, for nocturnal emission, you must also take "Nai'er's Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to astringe the vas deferens.</p>

<h3>Humphrey Davy (1778-1829)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shuying</p>
<p>The Chemist Who Invented the Safety Lamp</p>
<p>In the past, the thing coal miners feared most was firedamp in the coal pits, which, when it came into contact with flames, would cause a massive explosion like a mountain collapsing and the earth splitting. Because this kind of massive explosion would not only cause the entire pit to collapse, but also cause all the workers working in the pit to lose their lives. However, this does not mean that there will be an explosion as soon as there is firedamp in the pit. Its explosion is caused by contact with flames. If you try your best to prevent it from coming into contact with flames, it will not explode into a disaster. Therefore, lights and fires are not allowed in the pit, but the workers are mining coal in the pit. Since there are no lights and fires in the pit, and no other light shines in, they work miserably in the dark, and their suffering goes without saying. Therefore, they all hoped that someone could invent a safety lamp that would never cause an explosion for them to use. Later, Davy really invented the ideal safety lamp for them. The workers were extremely happy, and they called him a great benefactor. Such a scholar who has contributed to society is indeed worthy of our utmost admiration.</p>
<p>Davy was born in 1778 in the village of Penzance in England. His father was a poor sculptor. When Davy was young, he was more lively than his peers, and had a very strong memory. He achieved excellent grades in primary school. He liked to gather children nearby and tell extremely interesting stories. This kind of storytelling skill was also something he practiced himself while being run errands or walking. One day, his mother said, "Davy: Your aunt is sick. Hurry up and send this medicine bottle over." Davy agreed and immediately took the bottle and left. On the way, he was still constantly memorizing the story and practicing telling it. He completely forgot what he was holding in his hand and unconsciously lost the medicine bottle. It was not until he arrived at his aunt's house that he realized the medicine bottle was gone. The next morning, a milkman passed by the place where he had lost the bottle and picked it up and returned it to him.</p>
<p>When Davy was fifteen years old, his father unfortunately died of a sudden illness. He had five brothers, and he was the eldest. At this time, he had to bear the burden of supporting the entire family. After careful consideration of his future, he decided: "From now on, I will focus on studying chemistry, which I am good at! As long as I can make my mother and brothers feel at ease." But after making this decision, he lacked the funds to go to a higher-level school. He had no choice but to start looking for an opportunity to study and work at the same time. As a result, he had to ask his father's friend, Brigham, to work as a clerk in his store. Fortunately, Brigham, who was a surgeon and pharmacist in the city of Penzance, was willing to take Davy in.</p>
<p>Because Davy was determined to study chemistry, he was different from other employees. He was particularly diligent in his work and worked harder in his studies, so he was highly praised by his boss. He lived an extremely busy life every day, but what he was most eager for was chemical experiments. He found many old bottles, cigarette pipes, teacups, rice bowls, and gas containers to use as experimental equipment. As long as his official duties were completed, he would take the opportunity to conduct various experiments. Because he was the son of his boss Brigham's deceased friend, his boss paid close attention to his actions. One night, he experimented with a certain chemical substance, and the stench filled the sky, so the boss said to him, "Davy: Stop your experiments! No one can stand smelling such a stinky thing." But Davy was very enthusiastic about studying chemistry and refused to stop experimenting just because others stopped him. He had no choice but to politely ask his boss for forgiveness while moving the things he was experimenting with to a place farther away from people to work. He carefully studied the acid emitted by plant leaves and the air action of seaweed cells.</p>
<p>Later, Davy was able to enter a good library to do research work. And in the library, he met Gregory (son of Watt), who taught him a lot of chemistry knowledge. Soon he went to Bristol to work as an assistant at the "Air Therapy Experiment Institute." At this time, he began to be interested in studying gases. After repeated activities, he got a job in a gas research institute. He was always someone who was scolded while still experimenting, so after arriving at the research institute, he was like a hungry dog ​​looking for food, studying bit by bit, constantly and enthusiastically researching, and made important experiments on "laughing gas." He observed its special physiological effects, and from this invented anesthetics, making a great contribution to surgery. Later, he improved the battery and published the results of his research, which was greatly respected by scientists around the world. In 1803, when he was only twenty-three years old, he was hired as a lecturer at the Royal Society of London. He was originally just a drugstore clerk, but after only a dozen years of hard work, he became a professor. But not only did he not show any pride, but he became even more enthusiastic about research. No wonder he became a world-famous chemist.</p>
<p>At that time, the coal industry in England was very prosperous, but because explosions often occurred in the pits, the workers were all terrified. Their lives were precarious, so the explosion became one of the biggest problems at the time. Everyone hoped that someone would invent a method to prevent firedamp explosions. One day, Davy came to the coal mountain. The miners already knew that he was a famous chemist, and they all asked him if he could invent a safety lamp that would not cause coal pit explosions.</p>
<p>Before Davy, although many scholars and technicians had studied safety lamps, they had not succeeded. In 1813, Dr. Clanny of England also invented a safety lamp, but it was troublesome to use and extremely unsuitable. The second was the inventor of the steam car, George Stephenson, who made a kind of safety lamp, which was also used as a treasure by the miners at the time, but its structure was not very perfect.</p>
<p>After accepting this difficult problem, Davy first studied the properties of explosive firedamp and often went to the mines to conduct field research. At first, he discovered the surprising fact that "flames cannot pass through extremely thin tubes." After careful research, he further understood that "thin wire mesh is also a collection of thin tubes." So he used thin wire mesh to make a cylinder. This thin wire cylinder can not only allow the air needed by the oil lamp to enter, but also prevent the flame from reaching the outside. According to general imagination, firedamp is also a gas, so it will naturally enter with the air and cause an explosion, right? Actually, that's not the case. Although firedamp will also enter the cylinder, it will immediately turn into a flame. Since the flame does not come into contact with the firedamp outside, it will not cause an explosion. What an amazing discovery! After many experiments, he invented the safety lamp.</p>
<p>When Davy was experimenting with the safety lamp, a pastor named Hudson also helped him from time to time, believing in the power of science. Davy's first safety lamp was successfully invented, and Hudson was the first person to carry it into a coal pit full of firedamp for a risky experiment. When he entered the depths, a miner in the distance, working in the damp darkness, watched someone bringing fire in from afar, and was so frightened that he shouted loudly, "Extinguish the fire! Extinguish the fire!" He believed that the light in the pit was leading them to their death. But the light gradually came in, and he had to kneel down and pray to God to protect his life. However, although the light approached his side, it did not cause an explosion. What an incredible and mysterious fire! Davy's safety lamp has since been guaranteed by iron. After this experiment was successful, Davy was overjoyed, and the world gave him praise. The workers were so grateful for this life-saving treasure that they shed tears. The British coal industry also held a grand celebration banquet for him and presented him with valuable souvenirs. Russia also sent him a letter of thanks and a large vase.</p>
<p>In addition to inventing the safety lamp, Davy also invented the arc lamp, which is the origin of all electric lights, X-rays, and wireless telephones.</p>
<p>Davy was elected president of the Royal Society in 1820, and in 1821 he was awarded a title by the government. He has made such great contributions in the scientific community that he is already worthy of worship, but what is even more unforgettable is that he promoted Faraday. Faraday later became a world-famous chemist who invented electromagnetic induction, almost entirely due to Davy's cultivation. They both became the greatest figures in modern electrical science.</p>
<p>Davy devoted himself to research throughout his life, but unfortunately, his health was damaged by experimenting with firedamp. In his later years, he became more ill and could not do intense research, so he had to travel overseas. In May 1829, he died of illness on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland, at the age of only fifty-one.</p>
<h3>Zhou Chu</h3>
<p>— By Xu Ruben</p>
<p>During the Jin Dynasty in Yixing, there was a man named Zhou Chu, whose courtesy name was Ziyin. His father had served as the prefect of Duyang. In his youth, Zhou Chu loved martial arts, developing great strength, surpassing ordinary people. His father was an honest official who left no savings upon his death. Zhou Chu took his mother back to Yixing, supporting her through hunting.</p>
<p>Without proper guidance, Zhou Chu gradually went astray. Soon, he indulged in drinking, gambling, and prostitution, leaving no vice untouched. Furthermore, he was hot-tempered and quick to pick fights, making him hated and feared by the elders of the village. Some would even run away at the sight of his shadow. Observing this, Zhou Chu gradually became aware of his faults, thinking to himself, "This is all my fault. I usually engage in drinking, gambling, and meddling in others' affairs, and I offend people with my waywardness. How can people not dislike me? Now that I am older, I should resolve to be a proper person and accomplish something great, instead of being a rascal for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>Brooding over these thoughts, he strolled aimlessly into the countryside. Suddenly, he encountered an old man with white hair, his face etched with sorrow, as if burdened by great hardship. Zhou Chu was immediately filled with compassion and asked:</p>
<p>"Elder, the times are good, and the world is at peace. Why do you look so troubled and unhappy?"</p>
<p>The old man glanced at him and sighed, saying, "There are three great scourges in this area that have not been eliminated. How can one speak of happiness?"</p>
<p>Zhou Chu asked in surprise, "What are you talking about? I don't understand."</p>
<p>The old man replied, "The white-browed tiger of Nanshan, the great蛟dragon under the Changqiao Bridge, and... you! Aren't these three great scourges?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Chu said without hesitation, "What's the big deal? I will eliminate them for you, wouldn't that be good?"</p>
<p>The old man, hearing his words, replied with a tone of skepticism and sarcasm, "If you can truly eliminate them, it would be the happiness of the entire county, not merely the removal of scourges."</p>
<p>Zhou Chu said nothing. He went home, took his bow and arrows, and donned his sword. Alone, he went into Nanshan to find the white-browed tiger. After searching for a whole day, he finally found it. Zhou Chu was furious. He drew a sharp arrow, nocked it on his bowstring, aimed at the tiger, and released it with all his might. The arrow shot out like a shooting star, hitting the tiger squarely. The tiger, wounded, roared and ran wildly. The brave Zhou Chu chased after it, and with a few punches and kicks, he killed it.</p>
<p>The next day, shirtless, he stood on Changqiao Bridge, preparing to dive into the water to slay the 蛟dragon. The people of Yixing, hearing that Zhou Chu was going to slay the 蛟dragon, all rushed to watch.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard a "boom" sound, and Zhou Chu jumped into the water. The onlookers were staring intently when suddenly a large wave rushed towards them. Everyone knew that the great蛟dragon had arrived. They were terrified and scattered in all directions, leaving only Zhou Chu struggling in the waves.</p>
<p>Zhou Chu endured great hardship, forgetting the danger, the hunger, forgetting everything. He pursued it for three days and three nights, chasing it for more than forty miles, before finally killing the deadly 蛟dragon. He then jumped out of the water and went ashore, heading to the city.</p>
<p>The people of Yixing, having seen Zhou Chu jump into the river and not return for three days and three nights, had assumed that he had been killed by the great蛟dragon or drowned. Everyone thought that at least one scourge had been eliminated, and they rejoiced and congratulated each other.</p>
<p>When Zhou Chu returned to the city and found that no one cared about him, he said angrily, "With such people's hearts and such a bad environment, I cannot stay here any longer. I shall leave! I want to achieve merit and establish a career, do something earth-shattering, and show them."</p>
<p>He immediately went home to bid farewell to his elderly mother. He went to Wu to find Lu Yun. He told Lu Yun about his situation in Yixing, where he was ignored by everyone, and said, "I now want to improve myself, but I am already old. I am afraid it is too late." Lu Yun said, "The ancients said, 'If one hears the Way in the morning, one can die content in the evening!' How can it be too late? Your future is boundless. The only thing to fear is a lack of ambition, not the failure to achieve fame and success."</p>
<p>Hearing Lu Yun's words, Zhou Chu from then on applied himself diligently to his studies and behaved prudently. His morals and knowledge improved day by day, and he became a completely different person.</p>
<p>Within a year of leaving his hometown, Zhou Chu became the Left Secretary of the East Pavilion, and later the Grand Administrator of Xinping in Luoyang. In that area, the Rongdi and Guirenm tribes often caused trouble. Fortunately, Zhou Chu governed with wisdom and was able to subdue them. Later, he became the Grand Administrator of Guanghan. After taking office, he impartially resolved cases that had remained unresolved for over thirty years.</p>
<p>He was a very filial son. While serving as an official far away, he would resign and return home to care for his mother with medicine as soon as he heard that she was ill. He would only return to his post after his mother recovered.</p>
<p>Some time later, Qi Wannian of the Di people in the Western Regions rebelled. Some in the court, disliking Zhou Chu's upright character, wanted to use this opportunity to send him on a distant expedition, falsely claiming, "Zhou Chu is the son of a famous general, loyal, resolute, and courageous. He is fit to fight against the Western Rong."</p>
<p>Only General Fubo Sun Xiu knew of the conspiracy and sympathized with Zhou Chu. He said to Zhou Chu, "You have an elderly mother. You can use that as a reason to firmly decline." Zhou Chu replied generously, "When loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled, one must choose loyalty over filial piety. I have already resolved to sacrifice myself for the country. Thank you for your kindness!"</p>
<p>As the situation became more urgent, the court hurriedly dispatched Prince Liang Tong, Xiahou Jun, and Zhou Chu to lead a large army to quell the Western Rong. Qi Wannian of the Western Rong, leading a large army, was stationed at Liangshan, near Xiahou Jun's camp. Xiahou Jun sent five thousand troops to attack. Zhou Chu said:</p>
<p>"An army without reinforcements is certain to be defeated. Although we are determined to die in battle, it is not worth it to bring shame upon the nation!" Although his words made sense, Xiahou Jun did not listen.</p>
<p>Just before the battle was about to begin, Zhou Chu's troops had not yet eaten when Prince Liang Tong forced him to attack and cut off his reinforcements. Knowing that he would be defeated, Zhou Chu decided to rally his spirits and use his skills in slaying tigers and dragons to fight the enemy to the death. He, along with General Zhenwei Lu Bo and Governor of Yongzhou Xie Xi, attacked Qi Wannian at Liu Mo.</p>
<p>From evening until dawn, Zhou Chu and the others killed over ten thousand enemy soldiers. But in the end, they were defeated and surrounded because they were outnumbered. At this time, Lu Bo and Xie Xi, following Prince Liang Tong's secret orders, stood by and did not come to their aid. Zhou Chu's aides advised him to retreat temporarily. He widened his eyes, grabbed his sword, and said angrily:</p>
<p>"This is the day for me to serve my country! Why retreat? In ancient times, good generals always left through the gate of misfortune, showing their determination to advance and never retreat. Now that the armies are disloyal, the situation certainly cannot be turned around. Since I am a minister, is it not good to die for my country?"</p>
<p>After speaking, he roared and charged forward again, sacrificing himself under a hail of arrows.</p>
<p>When this tragic news arrived, everyone mourned. The court posthumously granted him the title of General Pingxi and provided land and property to support his mother. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Jin, he was posthumously honored as Lord Xiao. Because his loyalty and courage were moving, the more time passed, the more people admired him.</p>

<h3>The Abnormal Development of the Magazine Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fei</p>
<p>Due to the weak purchasing power of the reading community, which has led to the decline of standalone books in the book market, the rise of magazines in Shanghai (which can also represent the entire country) over the past year or two has been an inevitable trend. We believe that the essence of magazines is that they can replace standalone books. However, the reality has been very disappointing. The current magazine industry is heading down a path of abnormal development!</p>
<p>During the heyday of *The Analects* magazine, the dangerous future of the Chinese magazine industry was already clearly revealed. To put it bluntly, it also revealed the dangerous future of Chinese intellectual youth. Whether university students or middle school students, almost the first thing they would say when they met was, "Have you bought this issue of *The Analects*?" The carefree and playful atmosphere poisoned them. The effect of these magazines was merely to provide the youth with a moment of leisure while lying in bed or squatting in the toilet.</p>
<p>Since opening up this distorted path, the Chinese magazine industry has unfolded an even more frightening scene. Stepping into the threshold of magazine companies, what is revealed before our eyes is that the covers are invariably women, and the content is invariably low-grade and salacious. Rather than saying that what one sees are magazines, it is better to say that one is visiting a photo exhibition. If a knowledge-seeking youth wants to search for some proper nourishment in the magazine jungle, then he is truly destined to be disappointed.</p>
<p>We deeply lament this undesirable phenomenon of abnormal development and hope that publishers will realize that this is the act of a murderer who is killing young people!</p>
<h3>Introducing the "Shanghai Municipal Yearbook"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>Shanghai, the world's fifth largest city, holds a very important position in terms of industry, commerce, education, culture, and financial status. Its prosperity and decline not only affect the entire China but also affect the entire world. The position of Shanghai is so important, and the content of all undertakings in Shanghai is constantly changing and complex. Within this ever-changing and complex situation, there are naturally historical causes and effects, personnel changes, and various reasons for the world's influence on Shanghai or Shanghai's influence on the world. Because of this, all politicians, historians, economists, entrepreneurs, etc., urgently need a special book that records the situation in Shanghai. However, the past Shanghai municipal authorities did not pay attention to this, nor did the Shanghai publishing industry have the great power to supply this special book that is urgently needed by both Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office published a "Shanghai Municipal Yearbook" for 1935. Although the content was not very detailed and complete, it has won the praise of people from all walks of life, and various circles find it very convenient. This year, the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office has published another "Shanghai Municipal Yearbook" for 1936. After browsing through it, I deeply feel that the breadth and depth of the material taken, the conciseness and clarity of the compilation, and the completeness of the content are far better than before. This is something that we find deeply gratifying.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the following points in the book can be said to be the most satisfying. First, in addition to detailing the course of the year in each department, the history of the department is briefly described, and the origin and evolution are clearly understood. After reading this article, it is as if one has personally experienced the situation, which feels quite intimate and detailed. Second, in addition to using text records for each department, statistical tables are also used for detailed enumeration, which is clear and understandable, and is better than using text alone. Third, in addition to noting the national calendar year, month, and day for each event in the yearbook, the Gregorian calendar is also attached, which is also very convenient for readers.</p>
<p>The yearbook is divided into twenty-four categories: The first category is specials, including the new construction in the city center, etc.; the second category is a summary of major events, which details the National Games, literacy campaign, anti-smoking campaign, New Life Movement, National Salvation Through Aviation Movement, etc. in 1935; the third category is land and population; the fourth category is weather and climate; the fifth category is party affairs, which lists the history of Shanghai party affairs, the status of work, etc. one by one; the sixth category is administration, starting from the history of Shanghai City, and then describing the organization and administrative status of various Shanghai municipal agencies; the seventh category is justice, starting from the historical changes of the Shanghai judicial organs, and elaborates on the current organization and status of various judicial organs; the eighth category is foreign affairs, which gives concise and detailed records of the history, powers, and work overview of the diplomatic organs stationed in Shanghai; the ninth category is military preparations, which records the organization of Shanghai military organs, the current situation of the Chinese army, navy, and air force in Shanghai, and the statistics of the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai; the tenth category is finance, which has clear investigations on financial administration, the state of revenue and expenditure, the situation of municipal public bonds, and the current state of the central financial organs stationed in Shanghai; the eleventh category is finance, which has detailed records of the historical struggles of the Shanghai financial industry, the current situation of financial institutions, and the current situation of the silver and money industries; the twelfth category is education, which lists the vertical description of Shanghai's education and the horizontal status quo; the education statistics are particularly detailed; the thirteenth category is transportation, which has detailed records on railways, highways, shipping, transportation tools, roads, and docks; the fourteenth category is industry, with the yearbook using the "January 28th Incident" as the dividing line for the historical part; and there is also a detailed description of the current situation of various industries and the competition between Chinese and foreign industries in Shanghai; the fifteenth category is labor, with a clear narrative on the investigation of the living conditions of workers, the current status of labor administration, labor groups, labor disputes, and labor welfare undertakings; the sixteenth category is commerce, with accurate investigations and statistics on commercial institutions, commercial groups, international trade, and the status of various industries; the seventeenth category is agriculture, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry, with concise descriptions of agriculture, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, etc.; the eighteenth category is academic arts, with the trend of the cultural circles in 1935, the status of the publishing circles, and the investigation of cultural groups; the nineteenth category is religion; the twentieth category is social undertakings, including health undertakings, news undertakings, sports undertakings, charity undertakings, film undertakings, etc.; the twenty-first category is the evolution, population, and administrative status of the first special district, the Public Concession; the twenty-second category is the evolution, population, and administrative status of the second special district, the French Concession; the twenty-third category is a journal of current events; and the twenty-fourth category is an appendix. There are two concise tables in this appendix that are particularly worthy of our attention. The first table is the Shanghai calendar for 1937, with one table per month, with the dates of the solar terms, the sunrise and sunset times, public holidays, and memorial days noted on the top; the bottom notes the fire events in Shanghai's history for reference. The second table is a simple comparison table of the Western and Chinese calendars for nearly a hundred years before the Republic of China, which is very convenient for checking the past.</p>
<p>This "Shanghai Municipal Yearbook" published in 1936 is indeed much more detailed than the "Shanghai Municipal Yearbook" published in 1935. It can be used as a reference for modern people and is also the most reliable historical material. I would like to solemnly introduce it to the people of the country!</p>
<h3>From "The Analects" to "Yi Jing"</h3>
<p>— Yifu</p>
<p>However, in March, two other fraternal publications came out, namely "Heaven, Earth, and Man" and "Yi Jing." "Heaven, Earth, and Man" was edited by Xu Jie and Sun Cheng, and the president of "Yi Jing" was Jian Youwen, and the editor was Xie Yuyun. Both Xu Jie and Jian Youwen had been involved with "Ren Jian Shi," so on the surface, it can still be regarded as a sister publication of the "Analects" group, no, or it is more appropriate to think of it as a brother.</p>
<p>But a closer examination of the contents of the journal reveals that it is clearly different from the "Analects" group. Xu Jie, the editor of "Heaven, Earth, and Man," clearly stated that he is not a humorist or an advocate of the late Ming essays. He said:</p>
<p>"I have also written some fragmentary poems and prose, but they are nothing more than my inner feelings, or my feelings about the environment... I don't know much about essays, especially the late Ming essays, which I have read too little... Since I recited the Four Books and Five Classics in my childhood, I have only read collections of ancient prose and anthologies of poems by eighteen masters, etc. After that, I casually read only books of philosophy, and I haven't read any of the late Ming essays. This is his confession, which shows that he has not been influenced by the late Ming essays. He is running "Heaven, Earth, and Man" because he wants to become a "relatively youthful" publication, saying his own words, the content includes practical knowledge, wants to help each other at any time, advises at any time, does not suspect jealousy, and becomes a "big, intimate atmosphere, close to modern youth." Then this attitude of sincerity and solemnity is naturally different from the humorous tone. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Letter from Chen Duxiu</h3>
<p>To the reporters of the publishing world section of the Shen Bao Supplement:</p>
<p>I have seen several times in the publishing world section of your newspaper supplement that there is someone with the same name as me. In the future, I hope you will use my full name or even the same surname, that is, you should clarify that it is not me who is in prison, so as to distinguish and avoid confusing readers. I also ask you to publish this letter in the letters column. I am looking forward to it. I wish you good health. Signed, Chen Duxiu, September 27th.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Revises Secondary School Teacher Service Guidelines</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to all secondary schools and education bureaus yesterday, stating: "This Department previously believed that the responsibilities of secondary school teachers were becoming increasingly heavy and that methods of service should be requested in order to increase service efficiency. Therefore, thirty articles of the 'Jiangsu Province Secondary School Teacher Service Guidelines' were compiled into a booklet and issued as a cold telegram in December of the 22nd year of the Republic. Now, although the original articles are still applicable, the implementation of national salvation education in recent years has resulted in repeated promulgation. While the burden on students has indeed increased due to the importance of various important measures, the responsibilities that teachers should have have also increased with them. There are items that are not available in the original booklet. Therefore, after reviewing the needs of the situation, three amendments have been added, totaling thirty-three articles, recompiled and printed into a booklet, and issued to each school for compliance and ease of assessment. In addition to distribution, this letter is combined with the issuance of the aforementioned guidelines to order the school and bureau directors to immediately comply."</p>

<p>Hitler Sends Representative to Give Speech</p>
<p>The opening ceremony on the 18th was delayed until noon due to the late arrival of the athletes' delegation. In addition to the students and athletes, Dean Dai, Ambassador Cheng, and Military Attaché Feng Ti also attended. The German government also attached great importance to this conference. The Führer Hitler specially sent Justice Minister Frank Boht to attend and give a speech. After the opening speech by the president of the association, Chen Pusheng, Frank gave a speech first. His speech was simple and profound, enough to inspire deep thought. He said that the organization of the General Association of Chinese Students in Europe shows that the Chinese are striving for unity in all aspects, and that unity is the only way for China to become strong. Germany, like China before, was divided and disorganized. Later, with a good leader and the enthusiastic support of the people, the country was unified, creating today's status. China's current leader is someone we greatly admire. If all the people unite under his leadership, with China's size and population, it would not be difficult to achieve Germany's current status. Dean Dai cited the example of Premier Sun Yat-sen's diligent study during difficult times in London, and encouraged everyone with the legacy of "set great goals and do great things." Ambassador Cheng elaborated on the importance of the General Association in terms of cultivating body and mind, exchanging knowledge, strengthening relationships, and unifying will, which were all insightful and wonderful, leaving a deep impression on everyone. On the eve of the closing of the annual conference, the German Oriental Association held a banquet. More than 60 young German men and women who studied Eastern issues traveled from Berlin specifically for the event. The atmosphere during the banquet was extremely cheerful. After the banquet, a dance party was held, and fireworks were set off. This annual conference not only successfully completed its own mission, but also made a great contribution to the friendship between China and Germany.</p>
<p>Overview of Students from Various Countries Studying Abroad</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Chinese Students Association in Germany held a tea party and a general assembly for all of Germany. During the event, the presidents of student associations from various countries reported on the situation of students from their respective countries and their student associations. According to Jiang Hong, president of the Chinese Students Association in Germany, the number of Chinese students in Germany has increased significantly in recent years due to the low cost of living in Germany and the use of registered marks. There are now a total of 900 students, with more than 200 in Berlin. In every major city with Chinese students, there are branch organizations of the student association. The Chinese Students Association in Germany has been established for more than 20 years. In recent years, it has held a Sino-German friendship meeting and a dance party once a year, and the income from ticket sales is sufficient to cover the expenses of the student association. Shi Xiaoxian, president of the Chinese Students Association in Italy, said that there were only three Chinese students in Italy 20 years ago, and the number increased to six eight years ago. Only three years ago did the number gradually increase. There are now a total of 123 students. The student association was established only in April of this year and has considerable contact with the Italian Fascist Party and the diplomatic community. Recently, it launched a fundraising campaign to purchase an aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday and has already raised 15,000 lire. The student association's own funds are very tight. Chen, president of the Chinese Students Association in the Netherlands, said that there are about 100 Chinese students in the Netherlands, most of whom are local overseas Chinese students. The student association has been established for a long time and has ample funds. However, the overseas Chinese have been away from their home country for a long time, and many have grown up abroad, and are not familiar with the language and writing of their motherland. Efforts should be made to remedy this. Zheng Kangqi, president of the Chinese Students Association in the UK, said that the Chinese Students Association in the UK has a history of 40 years. There are currently 11 branch associations in the UK, which meet once every summer vacation. There are currently 400 Chinese students in the UK, most of whom are in London. Half of them study social sciences and the other half study natural sciences. Due to the taciturn nature of the British people and the bad weather, most students bury themselves in their studies and rarely engage in extracurricular activities or entertainment. Xu Zhongqi, president of the Chinese Students Association in Austria, replied that there are 30 Chinese students in Austria, most of whom are studying medicine, with 12 students. There are also five police officers, three in music and chemistry each, two in political economy and engineering each, and one in paper making, law, and diplomacy each. The student association was also established this year. Wu Yungeg, representative of the Chinese Students Association in Belgium, said that the cost of living in Belgium is the lowest in Europe, and the industry is also the most developed. Therefore, most of the people who come to Belgium to study are poor students studying engineering. The student association has been organized several times, but has been dissolved several times because there is nothing to do. It was reorganized again in the past year and stipulated that a general assembly should be held in Brussels every year on Double Ten Day. In the future, it may be possible to make the organization more sound. Guo Baozhu, representative of the Chinese Students Association in France, said that there are more than 400 Chinese students in France. Recently, due to the high cost of living in France, the number has gradually decreased. The study locations are mainly Paris and Lyon. The student association has never had a complete organization. There is a bookstore and a Chinese student association in Paris, but it is not an organization for all male students. After participating in this conference, efforts should be made to organize the student association. There is only one Chinese student studying in Poland, Fang Fusen. He was sent by the Sino-Polish Cultural Association and is currently studying road engineering at the University of Technology. He will be able to finish in two or three years. Mr. Fang also came to attend the conference. When he was forced to report on his situation as a student in Poland alone, it caused a roar of laughter in the whole place.</p>
<p>Chen Jiesheng's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Chen Jiesheng, president of the General Association, delivered an opening speech at the opening ceremony, explaining the significance of the conference in great detail. An introduction is as follows: This is the third grand gathering of Chinese students in Europe. The first was held in London, with students from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands participating. It was at this meeting that the General Association of Chinese Students in Europe was formally established. The second was held in the Netherlands, with students from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France participating. This is the second annual conference being held here, and it is considered the third gathering of the association. The holding of this annual conference comes right after the World Games. Due to the need to welcome the Chinese athletes of the World Games and the students from various countries coming to Germany beforehand, there was not enough time to prepare. The members of the association felt very sorry. Fortunately, the students attending this time are particularly enthusiastic compared to the past. In addition to the student associations from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Austria formally sending representatives to attend, there are also more than a dozen students from France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland who have voluntarily participated. At the same time, we are honored by the guidance of Dean Dai, Ambassador Cheng, and other gentlemen, as well as Minister Frank, the representative of the German government. The ambassadors and ministers have bestowed gifts, making the significance of this annual conference even greater. I, on behalf of the members of the association, sincerely thank all the gentlemen for the honor they have given to the association.</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the function of science has become increasingly prominent in Western countries. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation between Europe and Asia at the time, this function was not yet recognized by our country. It was not until after the Opium War that the Eastern countries realized the power of foreign guns and cannons and understood the function of science. Therefore, both China and Japan sent people to Europe to study abroad. The purpose of both countries sending students abroad was the same, but the results were completely opposite. Ito Hirobumi and Yan Fu were students sent by China and Japan at about the same time. However, Ito Hirobumi completed the Meiji Restoration in Japan, while Yan Fu only left behind a few translations. Although a student named Sun Yat-sen, who carried on the past and opened up the future, and his few loyal followers emerged, the revolutionary cause still could not be completely successful after decades of arduous struggle because most of the students were not up to par. For decades, the important figures on the political stage in China and Japan were almost all students who had studied abroad. However, Japan became strong because of its students who had studied abroad, while China, despite having students who had studied abroad, still cannot avoid falling into the tragic situation it is in today. Reviewing the past and observing the present, we cannot but admit that our policy of studying abroad has failed. We believe that there are many reasons for this failure, but one of the most important reasons is the lack of a spirit of unity and a unified will among the students.</p>
<p>We know that to save the Chinese nation from danger and extinction, there is no other way but the unity and struggle of the entire nation. Because the progress of human civilization and the completion of all undertakings cannot be separated from the division of labor and cooperation. Without the division of labor, conflict, chaos, and constraints are inevitable. To eliminate these contradictions, everyone must abandon personal prejudices, break down the barriers of schools of thought, and work together with one heart and one mind. Only in this way can we strengthen our strength, give full play to our abilities, achieve our goal of revenge and wipe out our humiliation, and fulfill the responsibilities that students who have studied abroad have failed to fulfill for decades. The General Association of Students in Europe was born under this meaning.</p>

<h3>You Sheng Soccer Team Slightly Defeats the Mint Yesterday</h3>
<p>The You Sheng soccer team played a friendly match with the Central Mint team at the factory's field yesterday. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. The Central Mint team is a newly formed team and has recently participated in the China Football "Class One League." The captain is Feng Yunyou, and the vice-captain is Lin Rongji. Although it is a new team, its strength is quite sharp. However, the team's coordination is not as skillful and experienced as that of You Sheng. In the 30th minute of yesterday's game, Li Songyun of You Sheng scored a goal. Soon, Huang Shiliang, the right wing of the Mint team, also scored a goal. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. You Sheng made many changes in the second half and was particularly active. Center Cao Qinfang scored a penalty kick. Although the Central Mint team had the general Feng Yunyou, he was alone and unable to make a difference. In the end, the result was that the You Sheng team won 2-1.

<p>Marital Knowledge</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<h3>Methods of Showing Love that Constitute Marital Affection</h3>
<p>……To form a happy family, one must have a strong physique……If men and women do not pay attention to sexual hygiene, their love will inevitably encounter waves.</p>
<p>Based on facts and experience, imparting some essential knowledge of sexual life can comfort thousands of pitiful men and women who are disturbed by these difficult situations. I will reveal a few key points for the benefit of both sexes, and reveal some secret and effective remedies for sexual life.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, if men and women can form a brilliant and happy family, with mutual intimacy and joy, the basic conditions must be a strong physique and a clever and alert mind. However, these two basic conditions are obviously encountering hidden reefs in the current licentious society. Although some of these hidden reefs are due to neglecting sexual hygiene during the honeymoon period, most are due to neglecting health care before marriage. For women, this includes improper handling of menstruation or insufficient attention to health care, or having a habit of masturbation, causing problems with the uterus, physical weakness, and incomplete development. But the most common reason is that men are immoral and suffer from venereal diseases. Excessive masturbation in the early stages can hinder development, most notably with small testicles and a short, weak penis; or due to masturbation, spermatorrhea and neurasthenia erupt, leading to premature ejaculation and impotence, causing pain and trouble in sexual life after marriage, or even complete stagnation. In addition, suffering from gonorrhea, lingering for months, and turning into chronic old turbidity, premature ejaculation and impotence are unavoidable. The most important key to solving this problem is that both men and women must quickly use medication and hygiene methods to remedy it.</p>
<p>A famous British venereologist, Dr. Havelook Ellis, MD, has conducted extensive research on endocrinology. He confirmed that underdeveloped development and impotence and premature ejaculation can be treated with the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" without fail. Indeed, when I was studying at the Butterson Hospital in the United States, a local famous medical doctor, Dr. Lucian, used "Gonadotrophin" as the main treatment for premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdeveloped development. For women with breast atrophy and menstrual disorders, he used "Female Gonadotrophin," which he confirmed never failed. However, if you suffer from gonorrhea or sexual neurasthenia caused by gonorrhea, then you must take the yellow pigment and varkoxin compound preparation "Anti-Lymph" to clear the leukorrhea and achieve the goal of radical cure.</p>
<p>Sexual Education, Volume 1</p>
<h3>Lesson 1: Types of Abnormal Sexual Desires</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dr. L. Tachb, British Medical Doctor, Edited by Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Humans all have sexual desires. Needless to say, sexual desire and appetite are the two major instincts of animals: no matter what class, no matter what situation, people do not have it. However, sometimes this sexual desire is pathological and manifests externally; in medicine, sexual desire is pathological and manifests externally, and is divided into two types: masturbation and homosexuality.</p>
<p>The so-called masturbation is common among young men and women. Those who indulge in it will have their energy cut off, their essence gate damaged, and nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea will occur, which will move with the depth of the bad habit. Newly adult men and women, if they masturbate excessively, their development will inevitably be hindered. This drawback is particularly evident in men, such as the shortness and weakness of the genitals, sparse pubic hair, testicular atrophy, and abnormally thin limbs. In women, menstruation is blocked, or menstruation is abnormal, causing problems with the health of the body. Regarding remedial methods, medical experts in Europe and the United States all attach importance to consolidating the essence gate and stopping nocturnal emission, and they all promote the effectiveness of "Hemit's Essence Consolidating Tablets." Based on our daily medical experience, this method is indeed the most reliable and fundamental cure for those with masturbation and nocturnal emission. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Letter from a "Gonadotrophin" User</h3>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>The Danger of Counterfeit "Gonadotrophin" Bottled Products</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am very ashamed because I knew about the act of masturbation when I was in my developmental years. In less than two years, I suffered from very severe spermatorrhea, and even spermatorrhea due to overwork. As a result, I was extremely panicked. Later, I saw in your publication that "Hemit's Essence Consolidating Tablets" can treat spermatorrhea, and "Gonadotrophin" can treat neurasthenia and underdeveloped development. I bought three bottles each of bottled counterfeit drugs from the 〇〇 pharmacy. Unexpectedly, after taking them, my illness did not lessen, but instead caused insomnia and diarrhea. I became suspicious, so I took the empty bottle to another pharmacy to inquire carefully, and only then did I learn that it was a counterfeit product. Of course, I was unwilling and negotiated with the pharmacy that sold the counterfeit drugs. Unexpectedly, they gave an excuse. When I bought them, there was evidence, so I should negotiate reasonably. After being deceived, I bought two boxes each of the genuine products (packaged in iron boxes). The illness began to heal. I think there are many people with the same illness, and I am afraid that they will be deceived, so I would like to ask you to publish this letter in your publication to expose its black curtain, which I hope will be allowed. Sincerely, Chen Lifan</p>
<p>Cessation of Menstruation</p>
<p>Dear Editor: A woman's menstruation is very important to her health, but my menstruation has suddenly stopped for two months. At the same time, I have found that my chest is tight, I am easily irritable, my spirits are weak, and I have lost a lot of weight. I have been diagnosed by a doctor and it is not pregnancy, but the medicine is ineffective. Please tell me a good way to regulate menstruation, it would be greatly appreciated. (Bai Lijuan)</p>
<p>Answer: Cessation of menstruation is purely due to the weakening of the endocrine gonadotropic hormones. Quickly take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Female Gonadotrophin" to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body immediately.</p>
<p>Unbearable Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The most painful thing in life is suffering from stomach pain. I live under the ravages of stomach pain. Even eating a little more food can cause severe pain and vomiting of acid water. I have suffered all kinds of pain. Please give me a method of treatment to eradicate it for good. (Qian Jun)</p>
<p>Answer: The only effective medicine for stomach pain is "Stomach Pain Relief," and at the same time, take "Stomach Strengthening Tablets" to help digestion and strengthen the stomach to eradicate it for good.</p>
<p>Too Much Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Dear Editor: As the saying goes: ten women have nine discharge, which shows that leukorrhea is very common. Almost all of my friends have it, but what I have is different. It is excessive, greasy, and abnormally foul-smelling. Please tell me the treatment method. (Zhang Huiling)</p>
<p>Answer: Excessive leukorrhea is caused by physical weakness. In addition to purchasing the external medicine "Leukorrhea Treatment," take "Female Gonadotrophin" to enhance physical strength and you can recover in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Hidden Illness in the Bedroom</p>
<p>Sir: We have been married for many years, but because I am underdeveloped and have a foreskin, my genitals are even smaller, and there is no joy in the bedroom. Please introduce a famous medicine for treatment, I would be very grateful. (Zhou Bin)</p>
<p>Answer: Quickly go to Dr. Zhan Nianceng to remove the foreskin, and take "Gonadotrophin" internally to assist development. After two months, you will surely have the satisfactory pleasure of a normal person.</p>
<p>Popular Medicine</p>
<h3>The Treatment of the Harmful Effects of Masturbation Caused by Sexual Impulses in Young People</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Jiashi, British Medical Doctor</p>
<p>According to research by most medical scholars! More than 90% of young people (most of whom are unaware of the harmful effects of masturbation) will develop the bad habit of masturbation when they reach the appropriate age. There are many reports by foreign researchers on the issue of masturbation among young people. In Japan recently, there have also been frequent reports of masturbation among young people.</p>
<p>Regarding the harmful effects of masturbation, German venereologist Harvey Elock and British physiologist Boris have confirmed that masturbation can hinder the development of the whole body, causing neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, mental depression, and other harmful effects. The reason is that excessive masturbation damages the essence gate, causing mental confusion, and nocturnal emission is inevitable. If it is delayed and not stopped, spermatorrhea will result from nocturnal emission, and the situation will be even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Young people are so drunk and indulged in masturbation, ignoring the harm. Therefore, scholars in various countries are working hard to study a perfect and complete cure.</p>
<p>German Bruleku is a world-famous venereologist. According to his statistics, 97 out of 100 people suffer from spermatorrhea due to masturbation among young people. The most reliable treatment is to consolidate the essence gate and stop nocturnal emission, which is the most effective. You should take "Hemit's Essence Consolidating Tablets" to stop nocturnal emission in a short period of time. At the same time, use "Gonadotrophin" to radically cure premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdeveloped development caused by masturbation. This method has been used for three years, and hundreds of thousands of people have been cured annually. This is truly the only targeted medicine for young people with spermatorrhea. When I was studying at the Royal Hospital in England, there were often men and women who were cured by this medicine and discharged from the hospital every month, which was uncountable. Therefore, the efficacy of this medicine has been seen in various countries, and there is really no need to repeat it. There are not a few young people in our country who have a habit of masturbation, so nocturnal emission is very common. If you want to restore health, there is really no other way.</p>
<p>Experience in Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>How to quit smoking safely and without pain? How to avoid the attacks and troubles of diseases? I can tell you the method of quitting here.</p>
<p>Before quitting, people who quit smoking always hope that they can quit completely at once, safely and without any problems. However, in fact, how can that be possible? You must know that people who smoke almost all smoke due to mental exhaustion or illness. As a result, they become addicted over time and cannot do without it for a day. If you drop the cigarette gun, your spirits will lose the stimulus to struggle, and you will become fatigued. Those with illnesses will still suffer from all kinds of diseases, and those without illnesses can cause various diseases such as neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, back pain, spermatorrhea, bone pain, etc. Because of these reasons, people who smoke all see quitting smoking as a difficult road. Therefore, there are countless people who quit and then smoke again.</p>
<p>Well, now science is all-powerful, and the difficulties and pains mentioned above can be avoided. That is the most popular method of cultivating and supplementing to quit smoking. Because people smoke, as mentioned above, due to mental exhaustion or illness. The cause of this mental exhaustion or illness is purely that the endocrine gonads have lost their inherent health, and the nerves tend to weaken. Smoking is to stimulate the nerves and become excited, which makes the gonads suffer more damage. Therefore, the method of cultivating and supplementing to quit smoking is praised, and a large amount of the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" is given to promote the health of the gonads, promote life, enhance physical strength, remove toxins and break addiction. The effectiveness is most sensitive. I have used this to quit smoking addiction for no less than thousands of people, and all have achieved successful success, without the slightest pain.</p>
<h3>The Sharply Alluring Female Breasts</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan, Graduate of Southeast Medical University</p>
<p>In Europe and America, women often seek treatment for flat breasts, making beauty salons extremely popular. Menstrual irregularities and incomplete development are considered important factors in losing beauty and health. Furthermore, nineteen women went to have their hymens surgically removed, which can be described as quite unconventional.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that a woman's beauty is closely related to her plump buttocks and high, erect breasts. A woman's high breasts certainly contain the most sharply alluring power and great health benefits. The beauty of the face or the beauty of the figure can be achieved through diet, exercise, bathing, and meaningful scientific care. If, unfortunately, one loses the plump development necessary for this beauty and health, then there is really no better method than to remedy it with scientific methods.</p>
<p>The softness of the face and the health and beauty of the figure are fundamentally based on the strength and vitality of the body's elements. A complete method of achieving these beautiful and healthy external signs is to maintain the body's suitability, sufficient endocrine function, and the promotion of metabolic functions. In 1934, France's most famous beauty expert, Krafft Ebing, said: "Female gonadal hormone endocrine preparations can cure women with flat breasts, unsightly buttocks development, dry skin, and bloodless faces." He also confirmed that he had used this method to cure 217 women with flat breasts, 125 women with old-looking faces, and 792 women with menstrual irregularities. Later, in 1935, a famous British medical doctor, Armand Ronth, and a German beauty expert, Maclran, collaborated to open a modern beauty salon in Berlin. They used exclusively female gonadal hormone preparations, "Gonadal Hormone," to treat unattractive women. Within ten weeks, more than 3,400 people sought treatment. Among these 3,400 people, 70% were German women, 15% were French women, and there were also women from Austria, England, the United States, and Japan. Two Chinese women also went for consultation, both seeking methods to raise flat breasts. According to his statistics, 32% had menstrual irregularities, totaling 1,104 people; 15% had flat breasts, about 863 people; 17% sought beauty treatments, 587 people; and there were also 19 modern women who went to have their hymens surgically removed. It is said that European and American women do not use the presence or absence of the hymen as a standard for chastity. Because the toughness of the hymen often increases a lot of pain during the wedding night, they often voluntarily go for surgical removal, some even going with their fiancés, so it is not considered strange.</p>
<p>The success of "Gonadal Hormone" in beauty has been recognized by famous scholars from various countries. The power of science is truly undeniable.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Rampant Spread and Terrible Nature of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by British Medical Doctor Olison, Abridged and Translated by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>According to a report by two venereal disease doctors, Breckenicge and Whitehocuse, in Germany, among 5,743 men recently examined for suspected venereal disease, 3,938 were confirmed to have gonorrhea. At the same time, there were also a considerable number of women, totaling 2,325 venereal disease patients, of whom as many as 1,211 suffered from gonorrhea. It is evident that many women suffer from gonorrhea. These women are mostly prostitutes, and the men mostly contract it from promiscuous and unclean prostitutes.</p>
<p>Among these men and women suffering from gonorrhea, 87%, or 4,996 people, were completely cured within three months, and 13%, or 747 people, saw a reduction in their condition. The only reliable treatment method is oral administration of the yellow pigment and vaccine combination preparation "Antilymph." In addition, washing methods and injections are used as supplementary treatments. Gonorrhea has always been considered difficult to treat, but now that there is such an effective drug, at least it is a step forward.</p>
<p>Knowledge about Bone Pain</p>
<h3>The Path of Gains and Losses for Those with Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The most important thing is to identify the method of treatment; some worsen due to improper treatment, while others are relieved of pain immediately due to the right treatment, all depending on one's own careful selection.</p>
<p>The treatment of bone pain is the most complex and troublesome. Even a slight carelessness can not only fail to achieve the effect of treatment but also worsen the illness. Therefore, the most appropriate approach when choosing medicines for treatment is to be precise and cautious. Gains and losses are determined at this moment.</p>
<p>"Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets," invented by Johnston in the United States, are the only effective medicine specifically for treating this disease. Whether it is bone and joint pain due to overwork, numbness and tingling in the limbs, or blood impurity after masturbation, sex, and venereal diseases, as well as rheumatic bone pain with internal rheumatic accumulation, kidney pain, arthritis pain, tendon pain, etc., one dose will show effectiveness. At most, after taking four or five bottles, all kinds of pain, numbness, and bone pain will be completely eliminated. It can also prevent the occurrence of arteriosclerosis, nephritis, stroke, uremia, and other symptoms. Therefore, "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" are truly the only savior for those with bone pain.</p>
<p>Patient Wu Xinlu, 36 years old, suffered from bone pain due to overwork and exposure to wind and cold. He also suffered from spermatorrhea in his prime, which further impure his internal blood, leading to the internal accumulation of rheumatism and more severe bone pain. When it flared up, the pain pierced his heart and lungs, and the pain throughout his body made him unable to move. He consulted doctors and took medicine, but they were all ineffective, and it only worsened. After I treated him with "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets," one bottle immediately relieved the pain. After taking it continuously for more than two months, his limbs and bones felt relaxed in every joint. Regardless of cloudy weather or seasonal changes, he no longer felt pain. It has been five months since the last flare-up.</p>

<h3>Several Points Worth Noting for Telegraph Senders and Receivers After the Implementation of the New Regulations (Continued from Previous)</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>(5) Scope of Application of the New Regulations: According to Article 1 of the current Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations, all telegrams exchanged within China, even if they have been transferred via the Yantai-Dalian submarine cable, or the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable, or the Tianjin-Shenyang landline, or the international radio station and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's direct radio circuits during their transmission process, are considered domestic telegrams. Therefore, except for the specific prices for telegrams sent to and from the four northeastern provinces and Hong Kong and Macau, all telegrams sent from various domestic locations to locations outside the customs are charged according to the domestic telegraph rates, regardless of whether they are transmitted via the Yantai-Dalian submarine cable or the Tianjin-Shenyang landline, and no additional fees are charged.</p>
<p>(6) Method of Writing the Receiving Place Name for Telegrams Transferred via Railway: For telegrams sent to places without telegraph offices but with train stations, the sender only needs to write the name of the station as the receiving place name, without adding the words "train station" after the place name, to reduce the number of characters in the receiving place name and save on telegraph fees. For example, for a telegram sent to the Benniu train station for delivery, only the two characters "Benniu" need to be written as the receiving place name, and it is not necessary to write "Benniu Train Station."</p>
<p>(7) Five-Cent Remainder in the Total Telegram Fee: The current domestic telegraph rate schedule stipulates that the rate for Chinese news telegrams sent out of the province is two and a half cents per character, and the rate for Chinese official telegrams within the province is three and a half cents per character. Therefore, the total telegram fee for each news telegram and official telegram often has a five-cent remainder. For example, if an official Chinese telegram is sent within the province with a total of 115 characters, the payable fee is four yuan, two cents, and five li. However, most places currently do not have half-cent auxiliary coins, so the sender can either pay the above five-cent remainder in copper coins according to the telegraph office's exchange rate or use a half-cent stamp as a substitute for convenience.</p>
<p>(8) Receiving Place Name for Telegrams Transferred by Post and Telegrams Delivered on Behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau: For Chinese telegrams transferred by post to places without telegraph offices but with post offices, and for Chinese telegrams delivered on behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau, the name of the nearest telegraph office transferring the telegram must be added before the receiving place name, such as Nanjing Jurong or Zhuji Yiwu. The above place names should be calculated according to the actual number of characters, together with the number of characters in the name and address of the recipient, with two characters counted as one character for charging purposes. For example, "Nanjing Jurong East Main Street Juxingxiang" has a total of ten characters, which should be counted as five characters for charging purposes. Also, according to item (2) of the explanation in Article 83 of the Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations, the receiving place name and the recipient's name and address in all foreign language telegrams should be charged according to the actual number of characters. The receiving place name for all foreign language telegrams transferred by post, such as Nanking Kuyung, should be charged according to two characters.</p>
<p>(9) Charging Method for Adding or Correcting Address Names in Paid Official Telegrams: If a sender sends a Chinese telegram and receives a notification from the telegraph office that the original telegram cannot be delivered due to the recipient's name and address being incomplete or incorrect, and wishes to ask the telegraph office to send a paid official telegram to add or correct the recipient's name and address, all the characters in the added or corrected address name can be charged according to the new regulations, with two characters counted as one character. For example, adding or correcting four address characters only requires paying the fee for two characters.</p>
<p>(10) Regarding the Names of Telegraph Receiving and Sending Points: For the names of telegraph receiving and sending points that have been listed in the telegraph office directory for delivery and have been assigned a call sign, such as Wusong in Shanghai, Xiaguan in Nanjing, and Gulangyu in Xiamen, the sender can write "Wusong," "Xiaguan," "Gulangyu," or use Roman letters to spell Shanghaiws, Nankingshn, Amoykls as the receiving place name, without adding the place names Shanghai, Nanjing, or Xiamen, to save on the number of characters in the place name. However, the names of other telegraph receiving and sending points that do not send telegrams for delivery, such as Caojiadu and Ximenjie Road in Shanghai, can only be used as district names and must still be accompanied by the place name "Shanghai" to avoid errors.</p>
<p>(11) Shorter Place Names and Abbreviated Place Names: If the same place has two names, such as Shijiazhuang, also known as Zhentou, the sender often uses the shorter name for telegrams sent to Shijiazhuang, etc., to reduce the number of characters in the receiving place name. The telegraph office can accept telegrams that use this shorter name as the receiving place name, but only if the place name has been entered into the telegraph office directory or has been approved by the Ministry of Communications. However, this shorter name may not be familiar to the average receiving operator, and it is necessary to consult the telegraph office directory to understand that "Zhentou" is an alias for "Shijiazhuang." After the telegram is received, it will inevitably take a considerable amount of time to look up the place name, which will inevitably cause some delay. If it is mistakenly sent to another location due to unclear writing, wouldn't the loss be even greater? Moreover, the new regulations stipulate that the number of characters in the receiving place name should be calculated together with the number of characters in the recipient's name and address, with two characters counted as one character. If the receiving place name and the recipient's name and address in the telegram, such as "Shijiazhuang Dama Road Xin'an Hotel," have a total of ten characters, using "Zhentou" instead of "Shijiazhuang" still has nine characters, and both are charged as five characters according to the regulations. In fact, no telegram fee is saved. Therefore, to avoid errors and delays, it is better for the sender to use the official place name. As for characters such as Yu, Rong, Hu, and Han, which are abbreviated place names, their nature is different from the above Shijiazhuang, also known as Zhentou. It is okay to use them in the text of the telegram, but they cannot be written as the receiving place name because this abbreviated place name has only one character, which is very prone to errors.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Telegraph Registered Code Transfer Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhang Weishan</p>
<p>According to Article 16 of the Telegraph Registered Code Regulations: "Telegraph registered codes shall not be transferred to others. If it is necessary to change the characters or change the name of the recipient's name or company, a new registration fee shall be paid to obtain a new certificate." Also, Article 18: "The registered code that has been canceled after the expiration date shall not be used for registration by other recipients within six months after the expiration date without the written consent of the original registered user." The above regulations are established to avoid misdelivery of telegrams and to respect the rights and interests of the recipient. Recently, many commercial firms have requested to change their company names, and some stores have already closed down and opened a new business with the same nature, wanting to retain the registered code for familiarity. In the opinion of the requester, these matters are not of great importance and can be borrowed casually, but the telegraph office must handle them in accordance with the regulations. Because the formulation of a regulation is based on past facts, and the focus is on respecting the rights of the sender. Originally, the telegraph office could not send telegrams for which registration was not renewed, because since the obligation to pay the registration fee has not been fulfilled, the right to enjoy the fee-saving benefit of registration cannot be enjoyed. The telegraph office has done its best to provide preferential treatment by reserving the registration for six months after the expiration date.</p>
<p>It has been seen that many commercial firms print their telegraph registered code on letterhead invoices or envelopes. Because they do not receive many telegrams, they do not renew their registration in order to save money. If the telegraph office immediately registers this code for a new user, if the old user accidentally sends a telegram, it will be impossible to distinguish whose telegram it is, and there could be a serious delay! In order to remedy this drawback, the telegraph office reserves it for six months to ensure thorough service.</p>
<p>A wrong delivery of a telegram not only delays the recipient's business but also causes misunderstandings for the person who receives it by mistake. Therefore, the transfer of registration must be carefully considered between new and old businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the following points regarding registration need to be stated: (1) After the expiration of the registration, the commercial firm should renew the registration on time, otherwise, not only will it be troublesome to pay the fee, but misunderstandings will also be inevitable. (2) The registered code does not have to be a single character. For example, the character "德" (virtue) is certainly easy to remember, but the numerical code "1795" is not easy to remember. And the numerical code "1234" is easier to remember than any ordinary character, so it is better to choose an easy-to-remember numerical code than to choose a character. (3) Some commercial firms have not yet registered with the telegraph office but have already printed the registered code on their letterhead or even notified the other party by telegram, only to find out when they go to the telegraph office to register that the code has already been registered by someone else. When the telegraph office encounters such a telegram, it will inevitably send the telegram to the person who has already registered, and only after they refuse to accept it will there be an opportunity to pick it up. Therefore, before the registration procedure is completed, it is best not to publicize it in advance. (4) According to the previous registration regulations, if a registered user wants to move their address, they should send the certificate to the telegraph office to change the address. Now, for the convenience of the sender, according to the new regulations, it is only necessary to notify the telegraph office by letter, but the registered code must be written, otherwise, the registration ledger cannot be corrected, so the telegram will still have to be delivered to the original address, causing more trouble and delaying business, for which the telegraph office cannot be responsible. All registered users should pay attention to the above points.</p>
<h3>Two New Initiatives for Long-Distance Telephone Services Organized by the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>It has been found that the Beijing-Hankou and other telephone bureaus have vast operating areas. After opening long-distance call notification services, if the telephone bureau sends messengers to notify each recipient who is far away from the telephone bureau to come to the bureau to talk, the messengers will take time to go back and forth, and the telephone business will inevitably be delayed. In order to seek speed, a "Notice to Call for Long-Distance Telephone Calls" was formulated, and the telegraph receiving and sending points cooperated to handle this telephone business. It has also been found that the business hours of the telegraph receiving and sending points that handle long-distance telephone services in the city are quite inconsistent. In order to facilitate the callers to make calls, a "Method for Transferring Long-Distance Telephone Services Handled by Telegraph Receiving and Sending Points" was stipulated for compliance. The main points of the two methods are stated below:</p>
<p>A. Regarding Long-Distance Telephone Call Notifications</p>
<p>After receiving a call notification for a long-distance call, the long-distance operator immediately checks the map for the telegraph receiving and sending point within the area drawn according to the address reported by the calling bureau, and notifies the receiving and sending point by telephone, informing them of the type of call notification, the original number, the location of the call, and the recipient's address, house number, name, time, etc. The telegraph receiving and sending point immediately fills in the above items on the "Long-Distance Telephone Call Notification Form," adds a stamp, and completes other procedures, and then sends a messenger to deliver it to the address at any time.</p>
<p>After sending the messenger for delivery, if (1) the recipient's address is unknown and cannot be delivered, or (2) the recipient does not come to answer the call after being notified, the delivering messenger or the receiving and sending point must notify the long-distance operator by telephone at any time, so that the calling bureau can be notified and the call can be canceled as a "paid cancellation."</p>
<p>If the recipient states that they will answer the call at a certain place immediately after being notified, the notification form will be handed over to the recipient to fill in the time of arrival and sign and stamp, and the messenger will bring the lower part of the receipt back to the receiving and sending point.</p>
<p>When the recipient holds this notification form and comes to the original receiving and sending point or a nearby receiving and sending point to answer the call, the staff of the receiving and sending point, after verifying that the stamp and the signature of the handler on the form are correct, immediately notifies the long-distance operator by telephone, informing them of the telephone number of the receiving and sending point, the name of the person answering the call, hangs up the handset, and waits quietly for the call.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Transfer of Long-Distance Telephone Services Handled by Telegraph Receiving and Sending Points</p>
<p>When the business hours of the telegraph receiving and sending points attached to various post offices are over, if there are long-distance telephone services that have been registered but have not yet been connected, they may contact the long-distance operator of the telephone bureau to transfer the call to a designated nearby telegraph receiving and sending point (limited to those that work 24 hours a day) to connect the call. When transferring the telephone service, the pre-filled payment receipt should be taken back and canceled, and the words "Transferred to 〇〇〇 Receiving and Sending Point" should be noted in the call column of the receipt stub for reference. A "Long-Distance Telephone Transfer Notification Form" should be filled out and given to the caller to hold for making a call at the designated receiving and sending point. The pre-collected call fee should be temporarily stored there and kept by the designated receiving and sending point for collection the next day.</p>
<p>When the caller is designated to make a call at a nearby receiving and sending point, they should immediately go to wait with the notification form and should not linger on the way or refuse for any reason.</p>
<p>When the designated receiving and sending point receives the long-distance telephone transfer notification form, it should immediately notify the long-distance operator of the telephone bureau by telephone, informing them that the caller has arrived at the point, so that the line can be connected and the call can be made. The transfer telephone notification form should be regarded as cash and stored at the point. After the caller has finished the call, a formal payment receipt will be filled out according to the amount of the call fee payable, with any excess refunded or any deficiency collected, and given to the caller as the income of the point.</p>
<h3>Recently Completed Telecommunications Construction</h3>
<p>A. Regarding Telegraph Lines</p>
<p>(1) Construction of Inter-Provincial Telegraph Lines</p>
<p>In order to facilitate inter-provincial communication, the Ministry of Communications has built new lines for telegraph offices on the borders of neighboring provinces and regions that do not have line connections, so as to avoid the turnaround of telegram business. The ones completed in August included the Henan provincial line in the Zhoujiakou to Hao County project related to the communication between Henan and Anhui provinces, which is 108 kilometers long. The Anhui provincial line in the Zhongxing to Si County project related to the communication between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, which is 66 kilometers long. And the Guangfeng to Pucheng line related to the communication between Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, which is 98 kilometers long.</p>
<p>(2) Repair of the Guiyang to Guanling and Chishui Du Lines</p>
<p>The telegraph pole lines between Guiyang and Guanling and between Guiyang via Jie to Chishui Qian have been in disrepair for many years. The Guizhou Telecommunications Administration has repaired them and added a line to each, the former is 219 kilometers long and the latter is 257 kilometers long.</p>
<p>(3) Repair of the Xiaogan to Laohekou and Badong to Enshi Lines</p>
<p>The Xiaogan to Laohekou telegraph line is 478 kilometers long, and the Badong to Enshi telegraph line is 211 kilometers long, which is very important for telecommunications traffic in the northwest and southwest of Hubei Province. The Ministry of Communications specially ordered the Hubei Telecommunications Administration to send personnel to repair them separately to ensure smooth communication, and a line was added to the entire Baen line, and a line was also added to the Fancheng to Laohekou section of the Xiaolao line.</p>
<p>B. Regarding Long-Distance Telephone Lines</p>
<p>(1) Jiajiang to Jiading Line</p>
<p>It has been found that Sichuan Province has built a pair of long-distance telephone lines from Chengdu to Emei. Jiajiang, which is not far from Emei, and Jiading to the south, is an important port in Sichuan Province with thriving commerce, and communication between Chengdu and Jiading is extremely important. The Ministry of Communications built a pair of Jiajiang to Jiading telephone lines, which is only 47 kilometers long, but after its completion, the original Chenge telephone line can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>(2) Ji'an to Gan County Line</p>
<p>Ji'an and Gan County are both important places in southern Jiangxi. Since the bandit rebellion was quelled, prosperity can be expected. The Ministry of Communications specially dispatched personnel to erect a pair of long-distance telephone lines in sections. From Taihe downwards, they were added to the existing telegraph poles, and new wooden poles were set up above Taihe, which is 230 kilometers long. It has now been fully completed and put into operation, and is connected to the original Nanchang-Ji'an long-distance line for communication.</p>
<p>(3) Booster Equipment for the Beijing-Hankou Line</p>
<p>The Beijing-Hankou long-distance telephone was originally one of the five major trunk lines in the nine-province long-distance telephone network plan. The line construction project was completed in June of this year. However, because the distance between Beijing and Hankou is long, and the booster equipment in the middle bureaus has not yet been installed, direct communication could not be opened for a while. So, it was first partially opened for communication between important cities along the line, and at the same time, it was connected to the Beijing-Tong, Wuhu-Tunxi, and Jiujiang-Nanchang lines for trial communication within the effective distance of the telephone voice. Now that the booster engines in Jiujiang and Yinjiahui between Beijing and Hankou have been installed, direct communication between Beijing and Hankou was officially opened for commercial use on September 1.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications newly added various long-distance telephone business locations and increased the number of communication locations (July and August)</p>
<p>A. Inter-Provincial Communication</p>
<p>1. Between Anhui and Henan Provinces: Bengbu opened communication with Kaifeng and Zheng County.</p>
<p>Huoqiu, Zhengyangguan, Bengbu, Shouxian, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and Tianjia'an opened communication with Gushi, Huangchuan, Luoshan, and Shangcheng.</p>
<p>2. Between Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces: Huaining opened communication with Shanghai, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Tongshan, and Changshu.</p>
<p>3. Between Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces: Jiading opened communication with Hangzhou and Jiaxing.</p>
<p>4. Between Jiangsu and Jiangxi Provinces: Nanjing opened communication with Nanchang.</p>
<p>5. Between Anhui and Hubei Provinces: Huaining opened communication with Hankou (Hanyang and Wuchang).</p>
<p>6. Between Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces: Changsha opened communication with Nanchang, Gao'an, Shanggao, and Wanzai.</p>
<p>7. Between Hunan and Guizhou Provinces: Huang County opened communication with Tongren and Zhenyuan.</p>
<p>B. Provincial and Regional Communication</p>
<p>1. Anhui Region: Huaining and Bengbu opened communication.</p>
<p>2. Hubei Region: Laohekou communicated with Fancheng, Zaoyang, Sui County, and Anlu.</p>
<p>3. Jiangxi Region: Ninggang opened communication with Yongxin. Xiajiang opened communication with Xingan. Taihe, Suichuan, and Gan County opened mutual communication and communicated with Nanchang and other places. Haihuisi opened communication with Jiujiang.</p>
<p>4. Fujian Region: Chuanshishan opened communication with Changmen and Guantou.</p>

<h3>A Brief Account of the Rational Learning of the Song and Yuan Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Wu Chengshi</p>
<p>Preface to Tan Pimo's "An Outline of the History of Thought in the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties"</p>
<p>My old classmate, Mr. Tan Pimo, has been engaged in the study of the rational learning of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties for many years. Now he has written his insights into a booklet called "An Outline of the History of Thought in the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties" and asked me to write a preface. I feel that in the kingdom of so-called "Taiji, Heluo, Heaven-Man, Liqi" vague influences, being able to use a philosophical standpoint and historical methods to discover its truth is a meaningful attempt and effective creation. Although using new perspectives to study old history did not originate with Mr. Tan's book.</p>
<p>I have no cultivation or understanding of the rational learning of the Song and Yuan dynasties. I can only present my crude and direct observations below. What I agree with can be used as a supplement, and what I disagree with can be used as a contribution:</p>
<p>Lu Zijing said, "When a sage appears in the East Sea, this heart is the same, this principle is the same; when a sage appears in the West Sea, South Sea, North Sea, this heart is the same, this principle is the same. When a sage appears above a thousand generations, this heart is the same, this principle is the same; when a sage appears below a thousand generations, this heart is the same, this principle is the same." "Heart" is thinking, and "principle" is the category or route of thinking. However, thinking is determined by existence. If the material basis—existence—is different, then the reflected psychology will naturally be different. Not to mention the East and West Seas for thousands of years, even people in the same place at the same time can hardly understand each other's "principles." Zijing's elder brother, Zimei, said, "Managing a family 'regardless' of wealth or poverty 'should' adopt the method of storing up for three years when nine years are bountiful, retaining two or three tenths of the income, and not destroying what is stored to break the 'established rules,' so that the family will not decline and the individual will not have unreasonable demands." I think: a hereditary landlord who pays rent and taxes—the Lu family was a large landlord—cannot imagine the sorrow of the extremely poor on the verge of starvation, just as a proletarian cannot imagine the so-called "should," "must have," "established rules," etc. preached by the wealthy. This is equally true, which is enough to prove the class nature of the Lu brothers' idealism, and at the same time proves that the half-sentence formula of "same heart, same principle" cannot be used as a protective talisman for analogy and reference.</p>
<p>Someone said: "The 'Qian' of the Book of Changes is the Alaya consciousness, which is the origin of all dharmas, hence it is said to 'begin,' and it constantly revolves like a waterfall, hence it is said to 'act strongly'; the 'Kun' is the Manas consciousness, and Manas clings to self, hence it is said to 'obtain a master,' and it constantly deliberates, hence it is said to 'have constancy.'" At the same time, it can also be said: "'After there is heaven and earth, then there are all things; after there are all things, then there are men and women; after there are women and men, then there are husband and wife; after there are husband and wife, there are father and son; after there are father and son, there are ruler and subject; after there are ruler and subject, there are superiors and inferiors; after there are superiors and inferiors, then ritual and righteousness have a place.' That is to say: first there is the solar system and the earth, and then there are plants and animals, and then there are two-legged upright humans, and then there is a transition from promiscuity to fixed marriage, and then there is a transition from matrilineal to patrilineal families, and then there are feudal states and hierarchical lords and serfs, and then some 'morality' and 'laws' and other means of control are established." But the Mahayana Buddhism came from the Brahman Samkhya, and materialism dialectics came from Feuerbach Hegel, etc.; at the same time, it is also adapted to their social foundation and developed. Who dares to fully and affirmatively say that the entire environment of the Book of Changes is completely the same as the environment of dialectics? Therefore, we should build the first half of the "same heart, same principle" formula on the "existence" of the social foundation before we can use it as a criterion for criticizing philosophy. Otherwise, it is just a "game of concepts."</p>
<p>We should analyze concrete facts from history and grasp correct viewpoints from philosophy. What is even more difficult is: in the records monopolized by the rulers, we must "remove the fur and wash the marrow" and "sift gold from the sand" in order to obtain constructive materials. Of course, we must overcome all kinds of difficulties and correctly use these materials, and not let them be "scattered money all over the ground" without a rope to string them together.</p>
<p>From another aspect, the rational learning of the Song and Yuan dynasties was somewhat more advanced than the Han learning, although they were both idealists. Zheng Kangcheng said: "The Heavenly Emperor has six: in addition to the five emperors of the five directions and five colors, there is also the Heavenly Emperor—the Polaris Yaopo Bao." Zheng commented on the Doctrine of the Mean, "What Heaven ordains is called nature," saying: "The wood god is benevolence, the fire god is propriety, the metal god is righteousness, the water god is wisdom, and the earth god is trustworthiness." He said that benevolence, righteousness, etc. are nature, and wood, fire, etc. are heaven. Heaven is both nature and personality, and at the same time it is a constellation in the sky, and at the same time it has a name and a surname: this is extremely childish, simple, mysterious, and pluralistic nonsense! By the time of the Song Confucianists, they demanded a unified worldview and a desperate view of truth. Therefore, they unified the five elements under yin and yang, and then unified yin and yang under the Taiji; still feeling that it was not enough, they added Wuji above the Taiji, mixing the Doctrine of the Mean and the Book of Changes to form an entire philosophical system. If you ask the Han Confucianists, "What is Taiji?" they might answer you, "It is Polaris," and if you ask "What is Polaris?" they might answer you, "Polaris is called Yaopo Bao." But the Song Confucianists were much smarter. They set it up: "The one Taiji is ultimately the ultimate that has no name that can be named." Just comparing this point can prove the historical process of its development from a lower stage to a higher stage.</p>
<p>The Song Confucianists' cultivation was stolen from the Chan sect's "meditation" and "watching huatou," and their cosmology, the so-called "Taiji, Pre-Heaven Hetu Luoshu," was passed down from Chen Xiyi. The former was commonly used by Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, Zhu, and even Lu Wang, etc.; the latter, those circles, dots, squares, rounds, black and white and other trinkets, were only vigorously promoted by Zhu Xi. Because the Taiji diagram passed down by the Taoists, plus the components of the five elements, actually made Zhu Zi dizzy, and in his later years he still drilled into the dead end of annotating the "Cantong Qi" and looking at Feng Shui. But they did a great duty, consciously or unconsciously, in terms of the so-called "three bonds" of ethics. Especially Zhu Zi made the greatest efforts, had the most followers, and the richest writings. He also placed the mysterious Taiji diagram at the beginning of the "Nature and Principle" book, proving that "the great origin of the Dao comes from Heaven," but in fact it turned into a golden hoop on the head of the Monkey King Sun Wukong. The wise and enlightened emperors at that time just took advantage of each other, so the Four Books, Elementary Learning, Reflections at Hand, and Enlightenment Benyi and other books actually ruled the imperial examination kingdom for more than six hundred years. Except for a few radical elements, there was no one who coveted what was not due to them.</p>
<p>However, the "existence" of history is bound to progress, so learning has to progress accordingly. Even from the perspective of methodological textual research, a glimpse can be seen:</p>
<p>At that time, what opposed Zhu's learning was the Jinxi School of Mind Learning on the one hand, and the Yongjia School of Economic Governance on the other. Zhu believed in "Wuji and Taiji," but Lu Xiangshan argued red-facedly that the two words "Wuji" were not found in the classics, and Ye Zhengze even fundamentally denied that the two words "Taiji" were the words of Confucius. However, Lu, Ye, and others' textual research was not as solid as Zhu's, who claimed to "ask about learning through the Dao," so they ultimately could not damage it in the slightest.</p>
<p>Sima Guang, Ouyang Yongshu, Ye Zhengze, Yuan Ji, Zhong Lin, Huang Zhong, etc. all did not believe in Hetu Luoshu. Zhu's last and only defensive weapon was only the sentence "Helplessly, Gu Ming, Xi Ci, and Analects all have these words." But you must know: Gu Ming, Xi Ci, and Analects do have the sayings of Hetu Luoshu, but they do not say that Hetu is fifty-five circles, and Luoshu is forty-five circles!</p>
<p>Zhu suspected that Mei's Book of Documents was fake, which was indeed a shocking discovery. But to build the "Daotong," he had to regard the maxims "Danger, subtlety, refinement, and unity," "Using righteousness to control affairs and using propriety to control the mind," and "Good has no constant master, but it is in harmony with oneness" as the heart seal passed down from saint to saint. He did not know that "the human heart and the Dao heart" came from Xunzi, who advocated the evil nature of man outside the "Daotong," and that "controlling the heart and unifying it" came from the unworthy Wang Su and Zheng Chong.</p>
<p>By the early Qing Dynasty, Huang Taichong and his brothers, Yan Baishi, Hu Huiming, and Hui Dingyu, etc., used precise analysis and broad-based proof to knock down the Hetu Luoshu, Pre-Heaven Post-Heaven, Wuji Taiji, and everything on the fundamental basis to the east and west. Yu Lichu said very frivolously: "Chen Bo has no calculating heart, no right and wrong, and it is clear that he is half-bright and half-dim like the Taiji diagram." After various serious blows, the kingdom collapsed and the Daotong disintegrated. We know that philosophy evolves with the evolution of natural science and scientific methods: the Suzhou School of the Qing Dynasty overthrew Song Learning, and the Huizhou School used the slogan "seeking truth, not antiquity" to overthrow Han Learning or Song Learning. Perhaps this is the dawn of a new philosophy that is about to shine brightly!</p>
<p>I have written the above words in a jumbled manner to reply to Mr. Tan. I also hope that he will continue to work hard to complete this great work.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xia Gaizun and "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House"</h3>
<p>— He Si</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House," 45 cents per volume</p>
<p>There are many people who know Mr. Xia Gaizun, and the more naturally know him better—although when talking about him, or even writing letters to him, they usually write "Gaizun" as "乞尊" (beggar Zun). What I know about him is not much more than the average person, just enough to distinguish "丐 (gai, beg)" from "乞 (qi, beg)" only.</p>
<p>His translation of Japanese literature is not much in terms of quantity; in terms of quality, after the rise of the New Literature Movement in China, he was also one of several trustworthy translators. Many people who know him probably know him from this aspect. But he himself has never advertised himself as a "literary man," and he doesn't seem to have any desire to become a writer. He himself wrote so little, and there were few opportunities for people to understand him in various aspects. Therefore, despite the fact that there are many people who know him, those who really understand him are probably just a few friends who have actual dealings with him.</p>
<p>In January of this year, he collected a portion of what he had written and published it under the title "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House." I read it because I wanted to understand his life and thoughts a little more.</p>
<p>This is indeed a collection of miscellaneous essays, with commentaries, novels, essays, and various types of writing. But regardless of the nature of the writing, what is written in the content, except for a part of current affairs commentary, is almost entirely the author's own feelings about his life and his experiences of life. As Mr. Zhu Peixian said in his letter to him (see the seventh issue of this magazine), "Such as memories of youth, sorrows of middle age... The words of reasoning are naturally also experiences."</p>
<p>Before you finish reading this collection, you will clearly feel that there is a "consistent spirit" flowing through it. That is the author's sincerity of emotion, frankness of attitude, simplicity and refinement of writing, and the intimacy of the life experiences he writes about, which makes you feel it from the bottom of your heart. Of course, this "consistent spirit" is something that every author should have; however, for writing like "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House," which is a self-expression, it is difficult to get much help from "observation" and "imagination," and it is even more important to feel this spirit.</p>
<p>Because "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House" is a true record of the author's life and thoughts, readers like me who want to know more about him will feel extra satisfied. Of course, the appreciation of literature and art will not let you easily overlook it.</p>
<p>As for pointing out which few of the thirty-three articles are said to explain the author's life; pointing out which few are said to explain the author's thoughts; or even quoting a few paragraphs from the original text as examples: I think it is all unnecessary. Because other readers of "Miscellaneous Essays from a Flat House" may gain even more than I do!</p>
<h3>"A Pilgrimage of Western Masterpieces"</h3>
<p>— Shijiao</p>
<p>Written by Feng Zikai—90 cents—Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Do you want to know some basic knowledge of art? Do you want to read an accessible and complete history of art? Do you want to read some biographies of famous painters? Or do you like to hear many interesting art stories? Then, I want to introduce to you this "A Pilgrimage of Western Masterpieces" to satisfy these desires.</p>
<p>Everyone who has read Mr. Feng Zikai's articles likes his kind, gentle, witty, and poetic tone, and his interesting structure. His essays are like this, and his art theory writings are also like this. This is the first feature of this book.</p>
<p>If this book is compared to a firecracker, then the appreciation of famous paintings in the book can be said to be the fuse, the biographies and anecdotes of the authors of each painting are the gunpowder, and the knowledge of art learning, appreciation, and understanding given to the readers is the grand and clear explosion.</p>
<p>The book contains a total of twenty-four famous paintings, which are representative works of twenty-two great painters. Some are bizarre and colorful, some are light and elegant, some are beautiful and delicate, and some are majestic and robust. The situation of the changes in art over the past four hundred years is clearly revealed.</p>
<p>There are twelve lectures, each with at least one extremely beautiful and moving story. Among them, the ones that make people laugh, such as "A Painter's Lawsuit for a Copper Plate," say that a famous British scholar Ruskin criticized the American impressionist painter Whistler's paintings at the time, saying that "he turned over paint bottles on the canvas for everyone to see," so Whistler sued him in court. As a result, the judge ordered Ruskin to pay a fine of one copper plate. Another example is "The Painter Who Cut Off His Ear," which tells the various ridiculous anecdotes of the Dutch mad painter Gogh (V.V.Gogh), which is also very interesting. Among them, the ones that can make people feel moved and cry, such as "The Poor Great Painter," write about the various poor situations of the modern French painter Millet (Mille): In order to practice what his grandmother told him on her deathbed, "to describe for eternity," he did not care about the psychology of people at that time who liked paintings of naked women and princes and nobles, but tried his best to make paintings with public value that people hated. As a result, he was turned upside down by poverty all his life. Among them, there are also those that make people feel bizarre, such as "The Wealthy Artist," which writes about the unpredictable changes in the life and fate of David (L.David), the modern ancestor of Western painting and the French classical painter, which is like a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Each lecture mentions many kinds of knowledge about art, which is very detailed and the narration is lively and interesting, which is no less than those beautiful stories. For example, when he talked about the methods of appreciating pictures, he said:</p>
<p>We sit quietly in front of the painting, so that the image on the screen shines into our eyes, and then "feel" the arrangement of the painting. The distance. The brightness and darkness are all very beautiful, like eating a glass of fresh milk: it is fat, fresh, sweet, and fragrant. But if someone asks you what the taste is like, you can't say it. You can only ask him to eat a glass and see for himself. Seeing the whole is also like this... (Page 22)</p>
<p>For example, in order to explain Delacroix's "Street Fighting," he wrote the entire history of the French Revolution into a very short and interesting story, which is also very rare. The whole book talks about painting methods, plus chalk painting, charcoal painting, sketching, watercolor painting, figure drawing, perspective, color mixing, light, arrangement of position, comparison between Chinese painting and oil painting, discussion of painting schools, etc., which are all very detailed. The twelfth lecture, "Emerging Art. Appreciation," summarizes the above lectures and gives correct criticisms, and gives readers kind instructions, so that they can get a way to study art, which is even more valuable.</p>
<p>Art is an essential element of the joy of life and an atom for cultivating a great mind. Although we cannot hope that everyone can succeed as an artist, we must at least have a considerable understanding of it. Therefore, I sincerely introduce this "A Pilgrimage of Western Masterpieces," which is most likely to arouse reading interest, to the general youth who are preparing to move forward.</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Art of Recitation"</h3>
<p>— Cao Kuibai</p>
<p>1. Extraneous Remarks</p>
<p>When I received "The Art of Recitation" from the green-clothed man, there happened to be two classmates beside me. Mr. A snatched it to read without my permission. I thought they were so eager to read it, it must be because they had a special love and interest in this book, definitely not because it was newly published or newly sent. Unexpectedly, Mr. A only looked at the title on the cover and threw it into Mr. B's hands!</p>
<p>"Why are you still learning the dead rules of old scholars? What's the use of buying this kind of book?"</p>
<p>I wanted to tell him with sufficient reason, but Mr. B had already flipped through it twice and handed it to me unnaturally:</p>
<p>"Maybe he hasn't understood the content of the book, so he bought it—this kind of book is just a roundabout collection of the reading methods of some ancient literary scholars! What's the difference from things like 'Ancient and Modern Reading Methods'?"</p>
<p>Neither of them was satisfied with this book. But I dare not agree with their attitude, because they first committed the following two mistakes:</p>
<p>1. Do not rashly criticize before seeing the contents of the book clearly.</p>
<p>2. Do not use personal preferences and dislikes as the standard of criticism.</p>
<p>Before buying the book "The Art of Recitation," there were two questions that bothered me and forced me to study the art of recitation: The first question was, why is the level of Chinese language in middle schools declining day by day? There must be something wrong with the learning method. The second question is, what benefits do the reading advocated by general educators or Chinese language teachers have for the improvement of our Chinese language level, except for not hindering others' self-study and being suitable for group life? Because I had these two questions in my mind, I, who had never learned the art of recitation since I was a child, resolutely read this science that my classmates considered outdated—"The Art of Recitation."</p>
<p>I spent a Sunday afternoon reading this book on the art of recitation. I couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!" This is not only not an outdated science, it is simply an important modern work on the study of literature and a good guide for the study of Chinese language. It not only tells us the experience of self-study and creation, but also says to the general Chinese language teachers in the conclusion for us students who are trapped in the decline of Chinese language level: "If we want to improve the Chinese language level of today's students, stimulate their interest in loving our national literature, and remedy their poverty and poverty, we must not fail to advocate the art of recitation." (Page 150)</p>
<p>2. Review of Reading Methods</p>
<p>Young people have no reading experience and often mistakenly believe that what people generally call "reading more" and "browsing" are the best methods of reading. After reading a few more books in general, they boast of "reading widely." As a result, they have no opportunity to understand the book's descriptive techniques, meaning, and humor. There is such a lament in the introduction to the art of recitation: "Great works that are worth memorizing and reciting are only understood after one lecture and one reading." Then it quotes Zhu Zi's opinion: "Generally speaking, when reading a book, you must first read it carefully, so that the words all come out of my mouth, and then think carefully, so that the meaning all comes out of my heart, and then you can gain something." This can be said to be the wonderful saying of gaining something from reading and being considerate of people's subtle feelings' (Page 5) To read a book is to achieve this point, and if you can "recite it orally and think about it in your heart," then you can feel "the joy of reading is endless."</p>
<p>The introduction also says: "Today's people only know how to read but do not value reading, or those who read but do not get the divine taste and wonderful meaning in it, all cannot avoid the ridicule of 'stopping at the city'" (Page 6) This is really trying to correct our mistake of emphasizing "reading more" and "browsing," and because there is no guidance from a teacher, even if we read, we do not get the method. It can be seen that this art of recitation is produced to improve our Chinese language level and guide our reading methods.</p>
<p>Although the art of recitation advocates "recitationism," it does not look down on the reading of browsing because of this. There is a sentence in it: "Reading and reading are really two kinds of work" (Page 6) In other words, "reading and reading are both indispensable." But to achieve what Mr. Cai Yuanpei said: "Those who eat meat spit out their bones, and those who eat fruit discard their cores. No one swallows it whole" (Digestion of Civilization), of course, we must promote the reading method of recitation.</p>
<p>However, the books that can be recited are also limited. For example, if you want to recite every great work, it is impossible in terms of energy. The author, Mr. Huang, has also seen this point, so he said: "Kunshan Fang Weiyi's poems and prose are clear, handsome, and outstanding. He is a famous master of a generation. He said himself: 'There are no more than a hundred articles that I am familiar with and can recite fluently'" (Conclusion, Page 147)</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the method of memorization, this is naturally the ultimate goal of recitation: "The advancement of comprehension and the tempering of memory are closely related. Therefore, the more thoroughly understood the text, the easier it is to memorize and recite." This sentence is the new opinion and new theory of the current art of recitation, sweeping away the dead reading method of strong recitation and strong memorization in the former private schools. So we must remember: our art of recitation is alive and dynamic.</p>
<p>3. Necessary Conditions for Creation</p>
<p>The art of recitation not only clearly tells us the method of reading, but also directly tells us the method of creation. My reading and my creation have both committed the mistake mentioned in the introduction on page 7 of the art of recitation: "The modern vernacular prose and poetry are mostly unreadable. Or even without chanting or deliberation, they are written in one stroke and sent to print. Those who buy and read it also only seek novelty and pleasure, and do not care about its rhetoric. Therefore, new writers compete to work hard on conceiving ideas, thinking, coloring, writing scenery, narrating people, and recording events, but ignore the silver chains of words and sentences in poetry and prose..." Although there are good writing materials, they are often not expressed in the most considerate way due to the lack of word and sentence training. Even if it is expressed, the shortcomings are not even known to oneself due to the lack of deliberation and chanting. Therefore, our creation must achieve</p>
<p>"When we create, whether it is classical Chinese or vernacular, rhyme or prose, when the manuscript is finished, if we can recite it once, we will immediately find that the words are not well chosen, the sentences are not well constructed, the syllables are not harmonious, the tones are wrong, and all kinds of unsatisfactory points; then we will repeat the recitation and repeatedly modify it until we feel comfortable." (Introduction, Page 9)</p>
<p>I think it is enough to be able to achieve this point when creating.</p>
<p>I dare not make a criticism on whether the art of recitation is good or bad after reading it hastily. This is just a report on a little bit of my experience after reading it. Each reader should discover it for themselves.</p>
