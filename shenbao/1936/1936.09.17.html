<p>李宗仁等的就職在六日國府發表新令的時候。就可以料到了。但是大家知道廣西同題是相當複雜的。尤其是近一月來所造成的恢復十九路軍和北海日人被害這兩種事件。使廣西問題的解决增加了不少的困難。現在李濟琛蔡廷鍇已經到香港去休養。把所統轄的部隊交給李白處置。翁照垣部也準備于二十日以前退出北海。而李宗仁等就在這時候就了新職。國人對于廣西問題的隱憂因此可以消釋大半了。</p>
<p>廣西問題所以能够順應着全國民衆的心理。在不流一滴血的條件之下。獲得和平的解决。這似乎不得不歸因于中央當局的寬大容忍。和廣西諸軍事領袖的「公而忘私」的精神。在中央方面。蔣委員長對於廣西。始終採取着寬大坦白的態度。絕不計較過去的恩怨。幾决三番派遣代表向李白疏通。無非要用和平的方式完成全國的統一。在廣西方面。李白等軍事領袖先前雖然對中央不滿。有過異動的表示。然而他們所提出的政治主張。郤始終以國家和民族的安全為前提。因此他們可以獲得中央的諒解。在明白了中央的誠意以後。也可以接受中央的新令。</p>
<p>以上所說不過是表面的原因。我們要知廣西問題所以趨于和平解决。實在還是中國當今的客觀環境所决定的。原來中國這一個國家又大又窮。無論在政治上外交上和軍事上。中央和地方當局的意見都很難一致。過去統一局面所以不容易完成就為此。然而五年來國家所遭逢的危機已經使全國民衆一致認識到當前最急要的問題是什麼。為了整個國家和整個民族的安全。非拋棄了其他一切問題的成見。團結一致地來應付這唯一的問題不可。這一種民衆心理。實就是盤根錯節的廣西局勢賴以順利解决的主要關鍵。</p>
<p>因此。我們可以說。李宗仁等的就職不僅表示着統一的最後一環的完成。而且表示着全國軍民準備團結一致。來應付中國當前最急要的問題了。</p>

<p>（柏林）西班牙蒲爾哥斯城國民軍政府國防委員會主席加巴納拉斯、頃向德意志通信社特派員發表吿德國人民書、略謂「西班牙國防委員會主席加巴納拉斯將軍、昭吿德意志人民曰、西班牙人民今為保護祖國、反對無政府及共產主義之破壞而奮鬥、乃承德國人民予以友誼之同情、精神之援助、西班牙人民自當永矢勿忘、抑吾人為抵抗共產主義馬克斯主義之在潮而努力奮鬥、其意義何在、此惟能負荷歷史使命之德國人民知之最審、蓋每遇歷史上最危難之時期、上天必授命西班牙以保護歐洲、勿受野蠻勢力之侵陵、今日之事亦猶然、彼莫斯科之徒欲奴役全世界、而貴國領袖與人民乃挺身而出、擔任東方之前衛、今吾人自亦深願擔任西方之前衛、則以値茲歐洲前途危急之秋、西方前衛亦與東方前衛同其重要也」云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西革命如成功　將實施軍人獨裁</h3>
<p>穆拉將軍之表示</p>
<p>蒲爾哥斯　西班牙北部叛軍司令穆拉將軍、今日在此間演說、以自信之語氣、斷言西班牙之前途、必將另有一番新氣象、穆氏宣稱、使西班牙喪失其殖民地國家地位之一輩人物、巳在無謂之感傷中、渡過其歲月、並以詭辯之辭、掩蔽其本身之錯誤、目下靑年義勇軍之熱望、卽欲造成統一與强有力之天主教西班牙、並恢復其在天主教戰勝時代所處之地位、穆氏復警吿全國、謂此次獲勝後、因當前各問題之性質及知識上之關係、一切建設工作、皆應由軍人擔任之云云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒反共言論　企圖破壞集體安全制　俄報著文痛加抨擊英輿論印象亦欠佳</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）消息報撰一社論題名為「火藥庫上持炬跳舞」、綜論德國社黨紐綸堡大會云云、「從紐綸堡之嗥呌中、吾人可析出兩種主要音調、一方面掩飾國內之耳目、使無視國內不安之景象·食物之缺乏·失業·貧困·破產等諸如此類狂掃而來之災難、別方面則用法西斯戰爭準備之瘋在示威、及其龐大之軍備、恐嚇及威脅鄰邦、對於內政、紐綸堡應係一帖奇重之新麻醉劑、對外則為實行敲詐勒索之恫喝、」</p>
<p>消息報繼略述希特勒之演說及德國經濟狀况問題、指出希特勒已完全承認其舊口號「吾人要槍砲而不要乳油」、申斥增加工資减少工時之建　為在囈、並暢談經濟繁榮、而實際則人民正忍受無邊痛苦、紐綸堡已宣佈第二「四年計劃」、使德國不再依賴外國原料之化學四年計劃、乳油脂肪肉則仍然無有、而竟稱之為「以便防止失望」云、</p>
<p>「如此、不但結果已完全明白、卽前瞻亦已預先决定」、第一四年曾刦掠德國以供養克虜伯、第二「四年計劃」將使「顏料托拉斯」壟斷贓物、紐綸堡之丑劇重心、决不在希特勒式經濟理論之展覽、實集中於宣傳與侵略之發動、正為此故、雖職業的德外交家曾屢致忠吿、希特勒仍昌然宣言要求殖民地、使第三帝國在英之友人戚極大之不安、而希特勒則得意忘形、竟白日狂囈、云彼需要蘇聯頒土、以便在德境內創造「樂園」、不但鳥克蘭、甚至烏拉爾及西伯利亞均在內、不多亦不少、此種荒謬絕倫之夢囈、除心靈全為虜刦掠奪等慾念所迷之狂人外、蓋無人能作者也</p>
<p>「希特勒旣如此、則其助手戈培爾羅森堡之流、亦繼起如斷鍊瘋犬之奔突、自無足怪、此種帮匪伎倆、此種口吻、此種屠殺製造家實國際歷史上所僅見、從此種瘋犬之毒液、此種熱昏之狂曍、此種讕言誹語、吾人祗有惟一結論可作「卽彼等方毛遂自薦、願為進攻蘇聯十字軍之前鋒、」然而以為德國法西斯主義惟一澎漲路綫、乃在東向之諸君乎、其慎勿安然自得、須知紐綸堡此批狂嗥及謔語之主旨、乃在用一切代價破壞歐洲已成之集體安全體系、此批戰爭煽動家全部怒焰之主要對象、乃法蘇互助公約、而不惜任何代價以破壞蘇捷公約、亦為德國法西斯主義之旣定目標、孤立捷克以便吞併之、鞏固其中歐地位以便挿利刃入法國心頭、待至軀體日肥、乃進一步對英國提出最後通牒式之威脅、爭取殖民地、斷然要求犧牲英國以重分配全世界、君等不信乎、法西斯蒂卽在今日巳昌言之矣、凡此蓋均據居歐洲心腹全身武裝之軍事壁壘之坦白計劃、且已開始實行矣、</p>
<p>「德帝國主義之毒爪目前已在西班牙活動、希特勒已抄至法國後方、同時更與意法西主義携手、圖謀將其大砲描準直布羅陀、歐羅巴將食其結果，戈培爾羅森堡之流方求援於英國、直至現在仍堅信英國傳統外交固定方法之份子、此種方法乃犧牲第三者以對侵略者讓步、戈培爾羅森堡之流亦在求援於法國、企圖將科不材士（德國萊因區一省）僑民心理、注入現代法國之徒、彼等不但甘願犧牲第三國並願犧牲共本國廣大羣衆、以便對德國法西斯蒂作任何讓步、法西斯匪徒正乞援於一切繼續作斯皮里金游戲之徒、彼輩已創造所謂「導行侵略他流」、「使戰爭局部化」等新理論此種手段並非俏皮思想、亦非俏皮外交、實不過希特勒之「我的奮鬥」之發展、在該書中實行刦掠之逐步計劃及階段、早經詳細說明矣、「紐綸堡實為洛迦諾五强會議之不坯的序幕、法西斯蒂德國已有條不紊地挖絕該會議之　株、目前合理的問題乃為蘇聯將如何應付該項血腥氣之宗教劇、蘇聯億兆羣衆現正與平時相同努力共創造工作、吾國社會主義之建設及威力之增固、决無片刻停止之時、吾國內較紐綸堡之狂嗥意義超過百倍之事業、正不知幾千百萬也」</p>
<p>眞理報社論略云、「紐綸堡大會之反蘇狂囈適得其絕對相反之結果、希特勒及戈培爾之演說、已從德國法西斯主義之戰爭企圖上完全揭破其口頭和平之面具、法西斯主義德國之赤裸的侵略者及戰爭煽動家面目、已完全暴露於全世界、該大會之舞台經理已遭可恥之失敗」（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國元首希特勒最近在紐倫堡國社黨大會發表演說、猛烈攻擊蘇聯、此間觀察家對於希特勒此項演說、印象殊為不佳、認為足以妨碍羅卡諾會議之進行、蓋英法兩國均欲設法在羅卡諾會議成立歐洲天空安全公約、今希特勒如欲摒蘇聯於談判之門外、則此項天空公約、殊無成功之可能也、負責方面人士咸以為羅卡諾會議倘欲召集開會、則尙須期以「相當」時日、或須有六星期之時間、方可作必要之準備、且此項會議、斷不能摒除任何大國於門外、此外有關於歐洲之任何問題、應無有例外、一槪提出討論云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅卡諾會議　召集日期未定　意德均主延期開會</h3>
<p>（倫敦）羅卡諾公約列强卽英法德意比會議、雖經長時期之外交談判、迄未决定開會日期、其會務之第一事、將為起草一新協定、以代替本年初為德元首希特勒所抨擊之羅卡諾萊茵公約、英政府現建議在十月杪舉行會議、可望由法比兩國政府同意、聞兩政府並將贊同會議在倫敦舉行、但意德政府仍欲延期開幕、據德國覆稱、會議在十月間舉行、其時間不足供繼續籌備事務之討論、意國則宣稱、在確切决定會議日期之前、仍應繼續外交上之交換意見、由上述情形觀之、開會日期仍須績加討論始能决定、但衆料該間題不難解决云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英國政府前邀請意國派代表參加在倫敦舉行之羅卡諾條約五國會議、本日意大利政府已照會英國駐意代辦應格蘭、表示意國在原則上接受英國此項邀請、但附帶一條件、卽在五國會議開會前、應先就外交途徑作預備談判云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意奧進行談話　一般認含有重要政治意味謀拉攏小協約國加入集團</h3>
<p>（羅馬）奧國外長史密德於昨日來意國、迭與外長齊亞諾伯爵、首相墨索里尼、舉行談話、對於談話內容、官方雖取保留態度、然一般人均認為有重要之政治意味、傳聞史密德來意以後、奧國總理休樞尼格或將接踵來羅馬聘問、至本日史密德與墨索里尼之談話、大概係商量如何使奧國在意國小協商諸國及德國之間、担任聯絡之責、此間觀察家以為意國與小協商三國關係之改善、曁捷克與奧國商的之簽訂（按捷克與奧國於本年四月四日簽訂商約、以促進兩國間之貿易）此兩事原屬殊途而同歸、蓋小協商諸國與加入羅馬集團之國家、實行經濟合作、實當以捷奧商的為其嚆矢也、抑近頃羅馬尼亞外交政第改變、有接近德意之勢、而意國與南斯拉夫商的談判、亦正在進行中、如是則小協商與羅馬集團之聯繫、自必日益密切云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>葡萄牙組民軍　反共鬥爭為目標</h3>

<p>（巴黎）里爾織工四萬人罷工要求改善工作狀况與增加工資、其情况現已大見寗靜、昨夜工人舉行會議後、各工廠代表同意接受資方之建議、决定立時復工、今日淸晨北省織工工團拒絕考慮將罷工延以消除法總理白倫·內長薩朗格羅氏·及不管部閣員旭丹·將於今日分別接見列里區工廠勞費雙方之代表團、預料屆時政府將提出一仲裁辦法、（十六日路透電）</p>

唐翠婷女士：所患便血後重，食减疲倦，坐骨脹痛，可「袖女容」增旺體力。　　白濁　本市黃健君：尊恙白濁睾腫，尿中濁絮甚多，可請姚菊巖醫師行最新抗淋血清一治療，未治前服「克淋儂」亦愈。　　遺精　蚌埠吳超可君：所染遺精每週五六次，只有進服「耐而斯遺精片」始能全治，其他失眠腦弱，可服「補體康」，至令友欬血肺病，可服「補肺拿爾」補縣裏滅癆。　　小產　南昌岳峰君：尊夫人迭次小產，白帶頻仍，小腹用痛，月經不正，可服「補女容」調經種子，外用「卡而雪地」納入陰道內為坐藥治帶。　　讀者如有疑難各病，請附回郵，並詳示尊年，寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥社，當卽照答。秋天的切身問題　怎樣才可使食慾增進  宋忠鈺醫師　　秋天患下痢的人應注意實際的療法　　時令已經入了秋天，在夏季患　夏，或是食慾不振的人，到秋天應該設法增加食量，以彌補以前的損失。而且，冬天一到，身體就需要大量的養料，這種大量的養料，只能是供給體力消耗的餘剩物，正像人們有多餘的錢，才能存積起來一樣。所以，秋天若不多進食物，到冬天只好讓養料塡補以前的不足，無法使它儲蓄起來。　　「怎樣才可使食慾增進」這是一個秋天的切身問題，即使食量由服健胃的藥物而增加了，那些食物是否能吸收還是一個問題。讀者知道，一些健胃的藥物，是沒有帮助養料吸收的，而且更沒增進營養的效用，只有德國的「强胃精」不特有强胃（較「健」胃力大，故云）的殊功，更因含有維他命ADB效賴因配（Vitamin-ADB-Choleinaure）黃色針狀結精，服後能夠與膽汁酸結合，故又有增進養料吸收和補給營養的偉力，凡慢性胃病胸悶，嘔吐作嘈，口苦舌淡，胃脹胃痛，一般虛弱和病後失調的胃呆，以及缺乏維他命B的脚氣症，服「强胃精」約四——七瓶前後，便立可全治。　　秋天「下痢」的病也很多，「强胃精」有作用於腸部防腐消毒之功，故下痢腹痛，洩瀉，大便閉結，瓦斯多而放屁，服了「强胃精」確然可以治愈。這是我的臨床實騐報告。</p>

<p>通俗講座蒙恬的功業  蘇子涵　　秦始皇手下　　將蒙恬，是中國歷史上有名的人物。蒙恬的祖先原是齊國人民，蒙恬的祖父蒙驚，在齊國出不了頭，才投奔到齊國去，在秦國做了將官，立下不少的功勞。蒙恬的父親蒙武也做了秦國的將軍，同着大將軍汪翦，東征西剿，替秦國開拓了不少的土地。蒙恬是將門之後，又是功臣之子，做將軍是很容易的事。　　蒙恬雖然是將門之後，但他並不是單講匹夫之勇的，他讀過詩書，學過兵法，是一員有勇有謀的良將。所以他能够建立了很大的事業，這些事業都是對國家民族有利益的。　　秦始皇併吞了六國，天下統一了，於是就把天下分成三十六郡，又把天下百姓們的兵器收集攏來，溶化了，另外鑄成十二個金人。秦始皇自己覺得，天下百姓沒有兵器，自然不會反抗皇帝，天下也就太平了。　　誰知燕人產生，一個遊方的道士，却奏上一本，說：在某處得到一往篇圖書就等於現的預言，上寫着：「亡秦者胡也—」　　秦始皇聽了，不覺大驚，面上却裝着鎭靜，心裏想：「朕雖然把天下平定了，但是還有北邊的胡人還沒有平定，他們同朕搗起亂來，朕的龍位仍然坐不安穩，總要把胡打平才成。」　　秦始皇想到平胡，自然而然就想到領兵平胡的元帥也自然而然的想到蒙恬的身上。　　秦始皇想！「這事須得蒙恬去，要這樣謀勇並備的人，才負得起這樣大的責任。」　　於是，秦始皇下詔，命蒙恬為帥，帶領三十萬人馬，出塞驅逐匈奴。　　那時匈奴活動的區域是在現在內外蒙古及綏遠一帶，趙武靈王曾經打啟過他們，展拓了不少地土，於是在新邊界上，從代郡現在察哈兩蔚縣東北起，至高闕現在河套西北角外止，修上一帶邊城，並在境內設立，代，雁門，雲中三郡。隨得秦趙相爭，中國多事，匈奴趁勢又把這些地方奪過去了，秦始皇命蒙恬爭奪的也就是這些地方。　　在邊境一上刀一槍同胡人打仗，建功立業，是中國古來的英雄豪傑頂高與幹的事。蒙恬奉了驅逐匈奴的命令，正是他發展抱負，建功立業的好機會。所以他得了旨意，就急急忙忙的把一切準備好，率領人馬，出征去了。　　秦始皇三十二年，大將軍蒙恬，帶領三十萬大兵，從郡現在陝西北部出塞，殺奔匈奴盤　着的代雁門，雲中三郡。　　兩軍還沒有打仗，蒙恬你要规划拒绝是你：「胡人是不大講道理的，他們害怕的是勢力比他們大的人。我何妨先打一場獵，給胡人觀看我國兵將的威風，也許能够先聲奪人哩。」　　於是蒙恬下令，第二天留十萬人馬守營，調二十萬大兵出去會獵。二十萬是多大一個數目，會起獵來應該多有聲威。在會獵這一天眞是旌旗耀目，刀槍射目。戰鼓喧天，威聲振地，將士個個驍勇，兵丁也人人矯捷。一天會獵的結果，得到的飛禽走獸眞不計其數。　　果然先聲奪人，這次會獵過後，匈奴的人馬都有些畏懼秦兵的勇悍。隨後兩軍對陣，匈奴先有了害怕的心，人人怯戰，回回大敗。蒙恬的大兵接連大勝，勢如破竹，不但把代，雁門，雲中三郡仍然奪得了，並且渡過黃河，把陽山也佔據了。蒙恬的威名震動了匈奴。　　蒙恬是有勇有謀的大將，他雖然把匈奴驅逐走了，但他並不從此便住手。他要想一個頂好的謀策，使中國的邊境萬年平安。　　代，雁門，雲中三郡，—現在的河套一地勢本來險要，土地也很肥美。趙國已經在邊界上修得有邊城，燕國因備東胡那時的另一種胡人，活動地帶在現在東北四省，也修有邊城，從造陽現在察哈爾宣化東北起，至喪平現在遼寗遼陽北止。在邊城裏面，設了上谷，溪陽，在北平，遼西，遼東五郡。秦國因為備西戎，在現在陝甘兩省也修有邊城。　　於是蒙恬相度地勢，擬好了方案，奏明奏始皇。秦始皇批准，蒙恬着手實行他的計畫。　　這時，除了代，雁門，雲中三都外，又加上河套外新設的九原郡。秦始皇三十四年，便開始做第一樣保護邊境的工作，便是把秦趙燕舊有的邊城，大加修理，加高加厚；又把這三叚邊城連結起來，在山谷險要的地方，設立了許多要隘，派兵把守起來也方便。這邊城眞不短，西邊從　西郡的臨洮—現在甘肅　縣—起，沿着棄趙燕三國的舊邊城，直到遼東郡的碣石—現在遼寗省達陽縣西—止，蜿蜿萬餘里；這就是有名的萬里長城。在那用刀鎗弓箭做武器的時代，這種長城直是一夫當關，萬夫莫敵哩。　　秦始皇三十五年，又呌蒙恬開始做第二種保護邊境的工作，就是從九原郡起，修一條「直道」，直通關內的雲陽—現在陝西浮化縣西北—從這裏，就有涇河渭河可以通秦朝的都城咸陽了。這條「直道」長計一千八百里，中間有山的地方便把牠挖開，有谷式溪溝的地方，便把　牠塡起，遇着容易崩塌的地方，便打下銅春；路身眞修得非常堅固。這條「直道」寬五十步，路邊第隔三丈，便種一株靑松，又可以保護路身了。萬一邊境上有事，有了這條「直道」運起兵非常便利；所以，就說是很遠的邊境，中央的軍隊開去救援也就很快的了。　　上面這兩個巨大的工程，雖然都是蒙恬在提調，在他的物裏修好，但是那底下也埋了不少無名英雄的血汗同骨肉呢？這些無名英雄就是那時修路的工人了。　　蒙恬不但在武功上替國家幹了許多事業，便是在文化上也替國家盡了不少的力量。我們現在用來定字的毛筆，便是蒙恬製造的。也正是蒙恬出征匈奴的時候。對於三十萬大兵，發號施令，提　調革這類的事，一天不知有多少；幷且隔咸陽有兩千多里路，軍事上政治上要春天明秦始皇才能够決定的事也不少。蒙恬便覺得用刀子把字刻在竹簡木讀上那種法子，旣不方便，又太遲緩，帶在路上又非常笨重；軍情如火，軍事又頂要秘密，萬一誤事，那還了得！蒙恬從前帶兵滅液晶　的時候，就在想造一種比較方便的東西來寫字；現在掌握了三十萬大兵，更需要一種方便的東西來寫字了。　　在那天因為要示威，才帶領了二十萬大兵出去會獵，打得不計其數的飛禽走獸的時候，蒙恬看見那一地的死獸，雖然血跡模糊，但是毛片都很好看，幷且看起來都很柔和，他忽然心機一，便想：「我如果把這些比較融合的獸毛拔下來，束成像扡們尾巴那樣，上粗下尖，或者可以寫字。你看扡們的尾巴打濕了　在地下不是弄成橫一條豎一條約痕跡嗎？」　　蒙恬就照着他想的去做，他先選那一些獸毛柔和點，結果他覺得鹿毛同羊毛頂合他的意。於是便拔了一些鹿毛同羊毛，又削了一枝枯枝，把鹿毛束在裏面，鹿毛的外面又束上幾層羊毛，弄成上粗下尖。蒙恬想做的東西做成功了，便拿來寫字，頗能圓轉如意，蒙恬大喜，便扡扡呌做筆。　　（筆便這樣做成功了。後代又加改良，便成了現在我們的筆；但是發明的功勞終歸是蒙恬的。　　蒙恬對於國家，在武備同文化上都有功勞，在武備專制時代都有功勞，但可惜專制時代是不講理的，不管你有天大的功勞，敵不過皇帝一時的喜怒。秦始皇死了過後，秦二世皇帝聽了宦官趙高的讒言，把蒙恬囚了起來，非弄死他不可，蒙恬便只好自殺了。牛頓1642－1727  李酉山　　牛頓（Isaac　Newton）於一六四二年生於英格蘭的林肯鄕，他出世的那一天，剛巧是耶穌的誕生日。他的家住在荷蘭斯少潑地方，父親薄薄有點田產，可是僅能維持一家的生活wbn的母親名字呌做安斯考夫，是他父親三十六歲那年娶過來的，娶後沒有幾個月，他的父親就去世了，又過了半年光景，才生下了牛頓。　　牛頓幼小的時候，身體非常孱弱，誰都以為他一定不能成長，不料長大後竟聰明過人。他的母親性情非常和順，並且很會處理家務。牛頓二歲那年的母親又嫁給北成脫姆的一個牧師史密斯（Barnabas　Smith），不久就遷到北威脫姆去住，把家務田事及他的敎育托他的外祖母管理，並且將嫁後所得田產的一部份給牛頓，那時半頓每年可得到租金八十鎊。　　他小時候，在村中的一個書墊中讀書，不多時進了格蘭脫姆　（Granthan）的蒙學館。他生性好動，不肯勤讀，所以在班中，他的成績最劣，可是遊對時的智巧勇謀，則為他人所不及。他曾經用紙做成燈，　在風箏的尼巴上，鄕人看見了驚為彗星有一天，他受了大孩子的欺侮淩辱，發憤鬥爭，竟獲得了勝利，從此他好勝的心，就推及到功課及後來的事業上了，凡事比人努力，結果凡事勝人，牛頓十五歲的那年。他的母親回到荷爾斯少潑來，就呌牛頓學做田事，每星期呌一個忠誠的僕人，帶他到格蘭脫姆去做買賣。可是他喜歡讀書，不願做買賣，便把這些事全部委託僕人，自己躱在在蒙學館讀書時所租的小房子裏讀書。後來素性不再到格蘭脫，單山僕人一人去，自己在路旁籬笆間讀讀書製製模型，等待他的僕人回來。在格蘭脫姆時，牛頓曾在屋中做了一雙水鐘，報告時刻非常準確，後來又在他家裏的牆壁上裝成了兩雙日規。　　一天，他正在籬笆間讀書的時候，被他的舅父看見了，嚴厲地斥責他為什麼不去做買賣，後來知道他是在研究算學，於是便勸他的母親再送他上蒙學館去讀書。畢業後，升入肯勃力期的脫靈業端（Trinity）大學。　　他因為在蒙學館時沒有學過科學，所以進了大學以後，盡力於名學和凱帕勒爾（Kepler）的光學，後來又從專研究歐克立特（Euclid）及狄卡兒（Descarter）的形學，深得其中奧妙，不久發明代數二項式乘方定理，二十一歲時，開始研究數學中最難解的無窮級數式及微分學。　　一六六四年，他初次看到月　，古時的人看見月　，以為是天將雨的預兆，但他說　月旁的圈，是由於空氣中水球或去片與光綫相遇到的作用而成。這年的冬天，他畢業於大學，得碩士學們。一六六五年，因為肯勃力期有大疫，避歸荷爾斯少潑，潛心研究他在學校中所得到的理想，發見離心力，並利用這種力來觀察行星的運動，後來又繼續加雷略研究動律，結果發明了物理學上最著名的運動定律，就是近人所稱的牛頓運動三律（Newton＇s　three　laws　or　motion）（　）　　一，情性定律　就是一切物體，靜止的總是靜止，運動的總是運動，其狀態決不變更。　　二，反作用定律　就是作用和反作用大小相等，方向相反。譬如將手用力蔽物體，物體也用同樣大小的力敲手，不過這兩種力的方向是相反的。　　三，運動定律　就是物體沿力的作用方向得一加速度，加速度的大小和作用的力為正比，和物體的質量為反比。譬如用手投擲石子，石子就沿着投的方向飛去，投擲的力愈大，扡的速度也愈大，假使用的力是一定的話，那末石子愈小的速度愈大。　　根據了他的三定，他又證明太陽與行星的距離的三方常和扡所行時間的平方成正比例。　　有一天，他獨自坐在園裏思想，忽然看見一雙蘋菒從樹上掉了下來，撲的一聲，打斷了他的思想。本來，樹上掉下一雙蘋菒來，是極平凡的事，照我們一般人的想像，蘋菒成成熟了或是受了風吹，原是要掉下來的，然而牛頓的智慧，竟與常人不同，他開始研究為什麼蘋菒不向上面掉，不向左右前後掉，而偏偏向着下面掉呢？結果，他發見了萬有引力定律。萬有引力定律，就是說兩個物體之間互相吸引的力量，和兩個物體相距離遠近的平方成反比例。　　一六六七年，他開始研究光學，自己製造天文望遠鏡觀察星斗，起初，他所製造的鏡片，不能完美，百改無效，他就以或者不是鏡片本身的緣故，於是取三稜鏡實地實驗光繞的性質，又被發見了光綫的性質，又被發見了光綫受了阻折，不僅光綫的形狀變成偏斜屈折，就是光的參差，亦大不相同。牛頓手製的第一個迴光天文鏡，現在尙存在美國皇家學會的藏書館。同時他發見白色的光為赤，橙，黃，綠，靑，藍，紫七色合成，並且說各種物體的所以有顏色，不是各種物體本身有這種顏色，不過不能吸收這種顏色而已。太陽光照着各種物體，各種物體皆吸收其所受的顏色，而反射其所不能吸受的顏色。從此顏色的眞性就明白了。此外航海用的六分儀也是他發明的。　　後來肯勃力期的大疫消滅了，他仍舊入脫靈業端大學繼續研究光學，不久校中的算學敎授巴路博士（Dr．Isaac　Barrow）辭職，就推　牛頓替代，他盡心盡力為母校擔任這個敎職三十年，其間從沒有離開過學校一步。　　他先後曾經做過皇家　會社員，上議院議員，鑄錢廠廠長及皇家學會會長，自小很信奉耶敎，並且很喜致研究神學，他一生沒有娶妻，人家和他談起，他總是這樣說：「我牛頓一生沒有滴出一點精液，也不欲犧牲上點精液。」　　一七二七年因病死於耶路撤冷公會所，年紀八十五歲，後來移葬在西憫斯脫寺。　　牛頓一生發明的東西，雖然不及愛迪生那麼多，可是亦不能算少，科學的進展，到了牛頓才大放光明。他對於力學及光學貢獻最大，數學上的定理，他發明的也很多。他那聰明的天資，勤耐的思想，好學不倦的精神，謙遜誠正的態度。使他成就了一生偉大的發明事業。出版界「本國文化史大綱」評  叔寒　　楊東　編　北新書局出版　　在近時出版的文化史著作中，楊先生這本書，編制方面，比較的還算新頴而有系統的。但錯誤亦頗多，最大的就是楊先生對於史料的抉擇，太不嚴整，致令「人錯亦錯」之處。數見不一見。今請舉其學學大者數端於下，以見一斑：　　（一）耒相的名稱，混淆已久，向來的注家都以為耒下入土的耓，或金。楊先生信而不疑謂「相以起土，耒為其柄」。（頁三四）實則耒與耜為兩種根本不同的農具。耒下歧頭相下一刃；耒為做傚樹枝式的農具，耜為倣傚木棒式的農具。今人徐中舒先生曾作耒耜考一文刋於國立中央研究院歷史語言研究所集刋第二本，證引極為　博。學者對此問題，如有興味，不妨參閱一下。　　（二）編者據後魏賈思勰齊民要術序，謂牛耕始於漢武帝時搜粟都尉趙過。（頁三六）不知此說前人已駁之矣，江永羣經補義雜說云：「有謂漢武帝時，趙過始敎民牛耕，非也。　冉伯牛司馬牛之名字，　耕用牛久矣。更有一切證，國語實　對趙簡子曰：「宗廟之犧，為??畝之勤」。謂貴者降而為賤，如宗廟犧牲，恐服勤於田也。豈非牛耕之謂乎？」雖江氏所舉證據，亦有可議處，如冉伯牛司馬牛之名字，王引之春秋名字解詁云：「古者耕以人力，不以牛力，作耕非本義、耕當為牼。說文牼牛　下骨也。引春秋傳曰：「宋司馬牼字牛」，卽司馬耕也……冉耕亦當為冉牼，古假借字耳。」於此可知名耕字牛者與牛耕無關。但實　所言「宗廟之犧，為畎畝之勤」，却可為春秋時已有牛耕之切證。　　（三）編者謂「秦與廢封建，為郡縣。」不始於秦。春秋時，趙簡子誓衆，有上大夫受縣，下大夫受郡之語。戰國時，秦惠文十一年，有魏納上郡十五縣的記載。」（頁一六三）編者旣知郡縣制，非自秦始，何不破廢些時間，於正文中略加考證，使讀者得些新鮮的見解？而仍要賣那「秦興，廢封建，為郡縣」的祖傳老藥呢？又編者所引郡縣制起源的證據，亦頗有可議處，蓋前者所言的郡實比縣小，與後世郡大縣小之制異致。若此可作郡縣制起源之證，則郡縣制西周時已有，固不待春秋矣；周書作　篇：「千里百縣，縣有四郡」，皀其明證。然則郡制究始於何時耶？史記：「吳王發九郡兵伐齊」；范　對楚王曰：「楚南塞門，而江東」；甘茂謂秦王曰：「宜陽大縣，名曰縣，其實郡也。」春申君言於楚王曰：「淮北地邊齊，其事急，請以為郡便」；匈奴傳曰：「趙武　王置雲中雁門代郡，燕置上谷漁陽右北平遼西遼東郡，以拒胡」；又言「魏有河西上郡，以與戎邊界」；則郡之統縣，始於七國之世，不亦昭然若揭乎？而後者亦非探源之論，周官遂人一五家為鄰，五　為鄙，五鄙為縣，五縣為遂，」固不必可信，而左傳僖公三十三年：「晋襄公以先茅之縣賞胥臣，宣公十一年：「楚子縣陳」，十二年注：「楚滅江漢間小國後，改為九縣，」昭公二十八年：晋分祁氏之田，以為七縣，「却足證縣制春秋時已有，不自戰國始。　　（四）編者於「詩部風靑靑子矜序云：「子矜剌學校廢也」……足見當時學校不修……（頁二〇六）按鄭風子矜本是一篇相思曲，硬被注解附會為「剌學校廢也，亂世則學校不修焉」。近人關之者甚多，而楊先生猶引為春秋戰國學校不修之證，可謂毫無史識者矣！　　（五）編者謂「始皇所焚的詩書百家語，只是民間所藏的，至於「博士官所職」，是沒有燒的」。所坑的儒亦僅是四百六十餘望星氣求仙藥的方士，而非眞正的儒生；因而斷言「焚書坑儒沒有絕滅的厄運」。眞正能算做學術厄運的事件，要推「罷黜百家，表章六經」一事。（見三五一—三五七頁）說得好像極有理，實則這也只是其一不知具二的說法。秦博士所藏之書，固未為始皇所燬；而「項習入關網校　秦降王子嬰，收其貨寶婦女，燒秦宮室，火三月不滅，而後唐虞三代之法制，古聖先賢之徴言，乃始蕩為灰燼。昔蕭至咸陽，收秦丞相御史律令圖書，於秦博士所藏書，獨不聞收而寶之。設使蕭何能與其律令圖書，並收而藏之，則項習不能燒；項習不能燒。則聖人之經猶在也」。（見劉海峯焚書辯却不能不說是學術的厄運。兩漢四百餘年之間，為什麼搜集經籍，費去極大的勞力，為什麼經術的傳授，感到異常的困難？為什麼學者除訓話外，竟不能有其他的新貢獻？論其原因，雖極多端，而項習焚秦宮，使博士所藏之收，悉付一，的實不能不推為主要的原因。楊先生不追識此，而以我國學術之眞正厄運，舍漢武帝「罷黜百家，表章六經」莫屬；就事論事，殊欠公允也。　　右述的幾個錯鋘是最大的此外尙有一二見解或敘事失當處，亦於順便指出：如編者以「文化卽生活」（頁一）未免太範統。若果如楊先生所言，則吃飯睡覺亦可以文化目之了。可是事實上，古今中外却從無認此為文化的學者。蓋文化雖屬生活形態，而此種生活形態，乃必須經過「勞働過程」而產生者；如衣食可稱為文化，而吃飮睡覺則否，卽其明證。初不若楊先生所說「文化卽生活之籠統也。又如編者敘述唐代茶稅云：「唐以前沒有茶稅，茶稅實始於唐德宗時。唐文宗時，宰相王涯始變茶法：禁民栽茶製茶，將民間所植的茶樹，移到官場，官自焙製，賣與商人。」（見九一頁）細味其言，若謂自王涯變茶法後，終唐之世，皆採官植，官製，官賣政策者。但此與事實不符，文獻通考：「王涯為相判二」民，復置榷茶，自領之，使民徒茶樹於官場，榷其舊積者，天下大怨。令狐楚代為鹽鐵使兼榷茶使，復令納榷加價而已」。舊唐書食貨志：「九年十二月，左　射令狐楚秦新置榷茶使額：「昨者忽奏榷茶，實為蠢政。蓋是王涯破滅將至，怨怒合歸；豈有令百姓移茶樹就官場中裁摘，茶葉於官場中造？有同兒戲，不近人情……伏乞特廻聖聽，下鑒愚誠，速委宰臣，除此使額……伏望聖慈早賜處分，一依舊法。」詔可之。先是鹽鐵使王涯表請，使茶由之人，移植根本，舊有貯積，悉令焚棄，天下大怨。及是楚主之，故奉罷焉一。考王涯「九年五月正拜司空，始變　法」，（見新唐書王涯傳）下距令狐楚奏罷　七月；故其法曾否實行，尙待考證，何可遽作如是籠統之敘述，以惑亂者之心目哉？簡愛自傳（五）  陳友琴　　英C白朗底女士作　李霽野譯　　生活書店世界文庫出版　　這當兒，忽然發生一件嚴重的事情，就是聖約翰要求簡愛和她正式訂婚，將來好一同到印度去傳敎，這個問題壽擣碎了簡愛的心了。　　照表面看，聖約翰年靑美貌，人格高尙，彼此又是姑表之親，簡愛沒有拒絕的理由，但是管愛認為他是嚴竣冷酷獻身宗敎的殉道者，絕不能拿出整個心靈來熱烈的愛一個女人，而且她對於羅契司特爾的情　並未斬絕。她須要回到桑恩費爾得去看她的舊主人，於是婉詞把他要求訂婚的念頭打消，告訴他她決不能做他的妻子，頂多只能做他一個事業上的助手而已。　　她向狄安那和瑪利說明她要離開她們四天，於是檢點行裝向桑恩費爾得去訪問曾熱烈愛過她的羅契司特爾，誰知事變出乎意料之外，桑恩費爾得府邸，被瘋婦人放一把火燒光了，（隨後她自己也跳樓身死，）羅契司特爾被一根屋墚落下打壞他兩雙眼睛，愛成又瞎又殘廢的人了。於是他搬到一個十分荒涼呌做芬丁的地方養老去了。　　簡愛聽到這樣的消息，立刻套車到芬丁去，在那荒涼陰　可怕的屋子裏，會到了羅契司特爾那瞎子，毫不猶疑地回到他的懷抱中，這對於羅契司特爾當然是天外的厚賜，於是他二人正式結婚了，並且後來他的兩眼竟有一雙恢復了光明，等他頭生子抱在他懷裏的時候，他可以看見這孩子有他以前一樣的眼睛—大，黑，而且明亮。　　其餘的人物結局，狄安那和一位海軍大佐結了婚，瑪利和一位牧師結了婚，聖約翰孤身一人離開英格蘭到印度傳散殉道去了。　　至於華特謝德府中的人物，也值得一提，因為那是簡愛兒時居住的地方。簡愛的舅母里德夫人一死，她的兒女們幾乎沒有一個如她的意，小約翰里德放蕩縱慾而死，自私自利的喬治安那找了一個有綫的丈夫絲毫不顧念她的母親走了，以利沙到法國道院去做女修道士去了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊可怕之梅毒螺旋菌  （振聲）　　梅毒一症，為弱國滅種之疾患，其禍不亞乎鴉片，我國之有梅毒，實始於明孝宗弘治未葉，時當西歷一千五百年，葡萄牙人航海至印度之果阿，由果阿抵我廣東，始有此病，其時呼曰廣東瘡，厥後寢染寢廣，流毒全國，今則無處靡不有梅毒之足跡，至其原因，前哲所論，紛紛不一，至西歷一千八百八十九年（淸光緒十五年）希姚丁，霍夫孟兩氏，始發見其病原菌，謂之梅毒螺旋菌形狀細小軟弱，長四——一四秒，幅約〇·二五秒，彎曲整齊且急　，極似螺旋，彎曲之數不等，大概多則二十以上，少不過四五，兩端尖銳，各具一細長之鞭毛，運動非常活潑，或迴轉，或進退屈曲，狀如蛇行，其繁殖力，異常旺盛，生活力亦强，彼淋菌在試騐管內，於室溫或孵卵器內，其壽命不過一週間，而梅毒蝶旋菌在試騐管內，於攝氏表三十七度即與人體之溫度相同，尙能生活二年三年五年不等，夫梅毒螺旋菌，好繁殖於濕潤之處，故人之口腔，肛門，陰戶，陰莖，皆為其最適常之住所，此菌旣侵入人體，發生症狀，不加醫治，直接危及個人生命，感染妻妾，遺傳子女，間接影響社會國家，衰弱民族、其禍之烈，不可勝言，皆其所賜，夫梅毒之可怕，盡人能知，故宜從速治療，然治療而不得其道，則貽害更深，且往往有一般患者，徒欲恃自療以求愈，是烏乎可，不過海上醫院林立，擇醫亦非易易，此中比較有悠久之歷史，深長之經騐，與相當之信譽者，當以法租界寗波路六十四號，父子醫院為最，該院歷來治療成績，與設備之週，昭昭在人耳目，可不贅述，敢就大略，以吿一般息花柳梅毒者。短波電療治淋之卓效  （見靑）　　靑年男子。涉足花業。不幸感染淋疾。或怠於治療。或惑於一針斷根。三天包好等不合法之治療。或妄貪便宜。購服假藥。致陷於數月·數年·以至數十年未能全治之慢性淋。不但危害自身。而且傳染妻妾。其結果。男子無精。女子不絍。世稱淋病能滅人宗祧者。良有以也。老慢性淋疾。即俗所謂老白濁者。尿道粘膜上。病　漫患侵淫而成普遍之創面。在後尿道者。允甚於前尿道。其粘膜顆粒及腺體。皆浸潤肥腫。尿中含有絲條。濁液時有時無。大率稀薄。惟早晨起牀後。尿道口為少許粘液所封閉。其他毫無痛苦，此際淋菌不易證明。蓋淋疾旣轉為慢性。淋菌多深入粘膜下而潛伏。遇有機緣。則復乘勢發作。故欲於粘液中發見淋菌。殊非易事。現今慢性淋之診斷。多利用漿苗之注射。使潛伏深藏之淋菌復出而現於稀薄粘液之內。再以顯微鏡檢查。即得證明。是故慢性淋之治療。非有可靠之診斷與夫優良之器械。胥不足以奏根治之效也。前人謂慢性淋為永不斷根之痼疾。良以診斷未得其道。及無相當器械以為之用耳。近世科學益昌。電療醫術。蒸蒸日上。乃有短波電療機之發明。用以治療淋病。特於慢性淋。功效之卓著。超越一切療法。發　高度熱力。深透尿道粘膜之內。對於組織。毫無損書。對於淋菌。可使完全死滅。誠不愧為治淋之利器也。（編者按。工欲善其事。必先利其器。而况醫乎。法租界。寗波路。父子醫院。對於治療淋病之電療器械。可稱有美皆備。如短波透熱電療機一項而論。該院所辦。種類允多。故往治者。均因症而施治。莫不斷根迅速。其得力於電療。誠非淺鮮也。）免費檢驗男女淋病  （聞琴）　　因為有幾種生殖器病。如攝護腺炎。尿道炎。精液漏等。很像是淋病的微象。普通人往往不容易辨別。因而私心惴惴。雜藥亂投。反而把病弄壞了。還有一種是淋病未愈。或初染淋病。却不把他認做淋病。因而遷延貽誤。豈不謬哉。要鑒別這種病的原因。最好是用顯微鏡來檢騐小便。可以分別出有沒有淋菌。就可斷定是不是淋病。這樣就不致有盲從醫藥的弊病了。在上海。設有檢騐琳病。而且是不收費用的。那末只有法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院了。就是婦女之患白帶。而欲檢查是否為淋病者。也很便利。而且是同樣的優待。白帶與生育  （景秋）　　白帶者。指女性生殖器漏出物之總稱也。此白帶。為女性所最煩惱之一事。然白帶之種類極多。凡生殖器之各郁疾患。皆能致此。夫健康之子宮體粘膜。其分泌物不多。不過排出少量之漿液性分泌物。而子宮頸管之粘膜。司掌粘液之分泌。通常外子宮口為玻璃樣粘液所閉鎖。若滑脫則自陰道漏泄。以潤澤外陰部。倘其分泌量一旦增加。則漏出不絕。而使外陰部沒其周圍或下衣為之汚染濡濕。是日白帶。而白帶之九五％由子宮而來。其主症為慢性子宮內膜炎。現時謂白帶之來於子宮頸管粘哎炎者。寗比子宮內膜炎為多。漏出之白帶。其色不一。有似玻璃樣之粘稠性者。有帶白色粘液膿樣者。有厚而稠若膿者。夫白帶之漏出也。外陰部為之濕潤。自覺非常不快。在肥胖婦女。外陰部及大腿內側之皮膚。因分泌物之刺　。而發腫脹。灼熱而至糜爛。痛癢俱來。殊為苦惱。其經過極慢。患者精神為之不舒。而陷於神經衰弱者不少。考白帶之原因。最多者。由於傳染。其主要者為淋病。故患白帶之婦女。宜速就醫診察。探其原因。原因除去。則白帶自愈。凡淋菌旣侵入子宮粘膜。發生子宮內膜炎者。幸而受胎。着床於子宮粘膜。然經二三月。必起流產。吾國婦女。染有淋疾者頗多。然大都羞不肯醫。以致淋菌上行。蔓延而起子宮頸　粘膜炎。子宮內膜炎。喇叭管炎。卵巢炎。子宮周圍腹膜炎。而卒妊娠不能。豈非大謬也哉。今有極簡易之方法。能使染有淋菌之白帶。及普通之白帶。均可即最短時期。霍然而愈。其法乃購藥二種。一為內服白帶片。一為外用白帶藥。同時並用。內外兼施。無不克奏全功。該二藥發售處在上海法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院便是。凡因白帶而艱於生育者。盍一試之。赤白帶下  （嘯雲）　　赤白帶下。為我國婦女獨多之疾病。月經時之不攝生。產前後之保養不得當。平時洗滌用品之不淸潔。皆足以釀成子宮　道之疾患。其結果為炎症性分泌物增强。輕者為黃白色而點膩之物。此曰白帶。重則內部黏膜發生潰瘍。表在血管腐損。其分泌物中混有血液。此曰赤帶。有因子宮　部發生腫瘍而赤白帶下者。有因于花柳病毒者。亦有因於體弱萎黃。急慢性單純性之泌尿生殖器疾息者。旣有此赤白帶下之症狀。自有一定之病因。奈吾女界。往往因羞於就醫。遷延時日。致病勢進行。釀成不治。殊深浩嘆。今上海法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院內。經售之『內服白帶丸』及『外用白帶藥』兩種。治婦女淋濁性白帶。以及單純性赤白帶。功效極著。為一般羞於就醫。及偏僻於內地而乏良醫良藥者之唯一自療之聖劑。我婦女界患者其注意之。漫性淋之流弊  （啓浤）　　旣染淋病之後。不事衛生之道。每易延成慢性淋病。此慢性淋病表面視之。初無皮肉之痛苦也。然而病菌之與日俱增。為當然之事。在潛伏時期。固無絲毫之感覺。但一旦爆發。則病勢之烈。有過於患急性病時之痛苦幾倍之。且淋病釀成之睪丸炎。攝護腺炎。淋巴腺炎。四肢關節腫痛等症。於極盛時代。固極痛苦。即使炎勢减退。往往留有結節。小則動輒發炎。重則器管為之失其效力。其最著者。即一度患過睪丸炎後。子嗣即生阻礙。攝護腺一經發炎後。時有早洩陽萎等症之續發。故凡有琳病者。宜早期醫治。並治之必至斷根為止。切弗因循誤事。致流弊叢生。悔之晚矣。然而治療不得其當。則弊害更深。是所以擇醫不得不愼也。上海法租界寗波路六十四號父子醫院。為滬上花柳病院之較可靠者。聘有男女醫師。臨診上之經騐豐富。一切電療等設備之完善。診治時之悉心週到。均有足可取者。肺腑語　　肺為司呼吸唯一之重要器管，亦頗易受病菌侵襲之區域也，我國病肺者獨多，因肺癆菌之散播力甚强，一旦被染，即起種種咳嗽吐血萎黃盜汗等症，肺部之潰爛亦日益擴大，而人體不支矣，但肺病之初期，自覺症狀極微，故人多忽之，方今科學昌明，有X光可以透視肺部，凡有疾病，均可一望而知，今有法租界寗波路父子醫院，公開肺部健康檢查，取費甚廉，故紳商學界，前往檢查者。絡繹不絕，誠醫界之好消息也，談言豐收  夢若　　我國頻年災荒迭見，全國農民生活，苦不堪言，本歲幸因氣候適宜，故吿豐收，皖省且突破三十年來的紀錄。在農村破產聲中，這實在是一個奇跡！然今年的豐收，對於一般農民，果有大好處嗎？這恐怕很難說吧。　　從表面上看，豐收無疑是農民的幸福。本來我國各地農民，平時終歲辛勞，秋收所獲，除納租完稅，自己祇够一飽，一逢凶年，情形就極悽慘！飢餓是不算什麼一回事的，有的還要賣妻　子，才能勉强度日。近年大部份農民，便是這樣在和生活掙扎。因是本歲各地農產，旣吿豐收，農民生活，雖不見得就能寬裕起來，但當比往年舒適不少。這是値得欣慰的！　　可是這僅是一個表面的視象，實際今年的豐收，對於我國一班農民生活，仍不能有怎樣好影響。因災荒給予農民之苦，是太殘酷的！今日全國農村的衰敗，未始不是遭歷年災荒所打擊。是故本年農產雖是豐收，各地農民生活，因往歲受創過鉅，實也不足補救於萬一，至多祇能暫時喘息而已。兄榖賤傷農，這次豐收，若不相當的調劑，農民說不定更要吃苦呢。　　然卽使是暫時的喘息，也就很難得。不觀近日各地農民，紛紛舉行獻榖禮，並集欵演劇，其歡躍之狀，可以想見。政府方面，也通令舉行豐收慶祝會，以資慶賀。不過說起樂豐年，舉行慶祝會，給農民娛樂一下，原是可以的。因我國一般農民，常時委實過於辛苦，難得有娛樂的餘隙。如要用來點綴昇平，便大可不必。因目前各地的農村情形，還未有分毫使人樂觀的地方。偶然的豐收，也掩不盡慘淡的面目！蘇州的抗租潮，還不是不久以前發生的事嗎？　　所以與其「慶賀」，不如宣傳一些，關於改良農業，增進生產，以及如何復興農村的知識，並指導農民改善自身的生活，倒還略有意義。藉娛樂以施農運，這就是時候了！老牛  休羊　　趕集的那天早晨，天沒有發光阿順就起身來了。房里沒有燈亮，他黑暗里在床邊習慣地拿過旱烟袋來，習慣地裝上烟，在腰兜子里掏出火柴來劃着燃了。在亮着火柴的一剎那間，他看見妻子睡得正濃，於是昨夜口角時的情形又在黑暗中開展在他眼前。　　鎭上每月有二次趕集。每次趕集的隔晚，阿順總得向阿婆商量一點東西，小麥，大荳，菜油子，那些他們的食糧，到集上去變賈。但是阿順是個酒糊塗，賣來了錢，他就在合興酒店坐到太陽落山，把袋里的錢完全灌進了肚子，才打跌着踏着月亮回來。這樣，老伙伴倆每次趕集總要鬥口，有時侯阿順仗着酒性也會把老婆打一頓的。　　昨天晚上阿順又向老婆商量東西了，老婆半响沒有回答他的話，阿順賭氣着把後屋的麻袋和缸蓋都打開了，總共量得半升大荳。　　「噌，你說：」阿順回進房里，把半升大荳向床脚邊一摔，冲着老婆：「把大麥藏到什麼地方去了？」　　老婆對他瞥了一眼，還是默默地沒有回答。阿順似乎眞的生起氣來了，他用拳頭碰着桌子，都盞燈亮的火舌頭冒了二冒，吐了一股黑烟。　　「老妖子，問你大麥藏到什麼地方去了？」　　老婆把燈亮捻亮了，才回答她的丈夫：　　「還問我嗎？問問你自己的肚子吧！」　　「什麼？」阿順肚子里正冒一股氣，他更重地碰着桌子，那燈亮祗一冒就熄滅了。但是他馬上從腰兜里掏出火柴來點上了，一我的肚子吃得下那末許多嗎？」　　老婆冷笑了一聲。　　「吃不下這許多，可是灌得下這許多呵！老牛！」　　阿順眞像一頭牛似的呼了一口氣倒在竹椅上了。他盤算着八畝田收多少大麥，完租，還債，賸下多少，現在已是七月半了，從開春到現在，趕了十三回集，又變賣了多少，算到這里，他注意着床脚邊的半升大荳，又看看老婆那張虎起了的妖子臉，他搖搖頭，想把那些算着的數目搖去似的，低下頭去埋在自己的手掌里。　　「老牛，」不提防老婆却開口了：「算淸楚了沒有？我問你下半年拿什麼來下肚？」　　現在阿順沒有話回答了。他怨恨着自己種的田太少，祇有八畝，有八十畝不是很好嗎？明年一定多租幾畝田來種，城里張老爺，，朱三爺，阿順祗要去說幾句好話，沒有不肯放給他種的！於是他像個八十畝的佃農似的想到牛棚里那頭老牛實在不中用了，種八畝田，打水，翻犂還要阿順忙不過來，種八十畝那老牛幹什麼用呢？好！阿順從手掌中抬起頭來，眼前已充滿着八十畝的希望。　　「老妖子！他說：「明年我們多種幾畝田，把那老牛賣去，變一頭新的……」　　「什麼？老牛（指阿順）！」老婆搶着說：「你做夢—把老牛賈了！」　　「我要種八十畝，那頭老牛幹什麼用呢？」　　老婆面色都發靑了，她的兩支手抖顫着，從扳凳上站起身來，走到老伴面前，幾乎要哭出來了：　　「老牛，想想淸楚吧！把牛……牛賈了，我們怎樣過活呢？」　　「你懂什麼！」阿順覺得老婆太殺風景，重重地把她一推，爬上床去睡了。在夢里似乎聽見老婆的哭聲。　　阿順抽完一袋烟，天色已亮了。他第一眼就瞧見床脚邊的半升荳，回過頭去老婆還是睡着，他輕輕地背起大荳的麻袋出門去了。走過牛棚的時候，他上了料，親切地拍着「老牛，我不賣了，我們是一樣的！」那頭老牛呌了一聲，似乎懂得主人的意思。　　阿順才興匆匆地上集去了。鼓浪嶼  麗天　　鼓浪嶼是南方的小靑島，是我們福建的金庫。在這不滿十方里的小島上，有着我們福建挺壯麗的洋樓別墅，和披滿綠蔭的淸幽小道。雖是一班權貴，僅能以花轎代步：間也可看到中國式的類似廟宇的房屋點綴其中，但這並沒損牠高傲絲毫，而且更能顯示出牠的寂靜與古風味。　　「怪怪，這是個什麼樣的地方啊！」　　每個北方的流浪漢或鄉下士佬，當踏入牠的肚腹時，總要被引得驚訝起來。就連島上的居民，也常引以自豪。　　「去啦！到我們鼓浪嶼去玩一玩啦！」　　的確的，鼓浪嶼是個好地方，幽美不過的。在那裏，不僅有高聳的銀行，有高貴的旅舍，有「救世」「博愛」的醫院，有在總會跟影戲院，且有一百元就可討到老婆的「婢女救援團」。在內地裏的人，雖沒有福份去往宿一夜天，但總把望去觀望一趟。尤其是一當地方發生變故，一班紳豪，就相率携家帶眷，像世外桃源似的「隱居」去了。為的它是萬國租界，且是跟鷺島—厦門遙對沒三里遠的孤島啦！　　在那兒的居民，有着類似盎格爾薩克遜民族的意味。他們很講禮節，厭棄內地人的粗喉嗄啞大半的人虔誠於耶穌敎。全島十幾間的中小學，幾全部是教會立的；今夏全國第二次基督教徒的</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>沐經大會，就在島上舉行。為了它不是商業都市，沒有那種布儈的喧囂，所以一班的居民，總像很舒適安聞的。尤其是千金小姐，他們的修飾，是不亞於　上；只是也許太過於曠閒吧，她們總像永不厭煩地在交談着別人家各色各樣的家庭瑣事；只要一剎那前　人因失戀自殺或求愛　火，　　上　　　每個人　耳朶裏去。沒多久前，我到那兒去拜訪一個友人，他很幽默地這樣吿訴我：「我姐姐的一些女友，前兩天才討論着：『在鼓浪嶼　地方所噢到的是不是　經味』這樣一個問題哩！」但她們却擁有五六百個中年未出嫁的姑娘，她們都很虔　地宣稱要把生命獻給主—耶穌基督只是沒多久前，有一些）善良的主婦，為了島上工部局勵行婢女登記而苦惱着。　　「一個婢女要月捐十塊錢，倒不如僱個娘姨要省錢！」　　她們就儘在這樣相互訴說着。這是確實的，每個娘姨一個月頂多五六塊錢就够了。據一般人的推測：在兩萬的島上居民中，有五分之一是屬於娘姨婢女階層的。　　是的，那是是個好地方，在夏天，我們總可以看到在週遭的海灘上，有着無數的靑年男女「游泳家」，穿着各色各樣的緊身游泳衣，鼓着笑臉窩，在跟波浪嘻戲「搏擊」。　　但是，它畢竟是神秘的。那兒不僅有新舊十八猛或三十六猛的流氓集團，有時常被破獲的綁匪機關，有各種黨徒潛伏的人物；且有那魔鬼似的黑手，在策劃着，盤算着怎樣把閩南，把福建，甚而把全華南掠到那沒多遠的一個島上去，那黑手，現在已在閩南的每個角落，扮演着「自治」劇目。舊同事  里昂　　小病後痿癩地躺在那張破舊的籐交椅上，賣麵包的呌破了巷弄的沉寂的時候，溫淡的秋陽祇留一斜角塊貼在小窗上端，　蟲在箴　裏呌着牠最後的命運，妻近來為我的病不安心，再也不把餵靑豆放在心裏，篾籠裏的豆子己經乾癟發黑，亦許牠為着食糧而呌之不已吧。這對於為生活而呼號的象徵，一支銳針似的，又挑痛了我的創疤：自己是被生活摒棄了，兩三年來，常把牙齒咬住嘴唇，把一長串活泥般的日子打發過的。　　想到以後的生活怎樣彌補？正茫然地對着卽將隱沒的窗上的陽光時，樓梯上起了一陣熟悉的脚步聲，『又是朱沛生』，我聽出他的破皮鞋後跟釘有鐵釘子。不錯，絲毫都不錯，一張棕色油光光的三角臉在房門口出現了，兩三個月沒剪的頭髮跟烏鴉窠般的。鬢脚已伸到耳下，把襯托得格外小而骯髒，柳條斜紋襯衫沒裝領子，白帆布西褲連縫條也找不出了。他是我三年前在烟廠裏的同事，一個結實的年輕夥子，出身是那樣悽慘，從小喪亡了爹媽被送進孤兒院的。烟草廠裏的經理便是孤兒院的董事。畢業後被派在廠裏葉子間做事，日夜吞烟灰，見不到明朗的陽光，十分苦的差使呵。那時我在廠裏管機務間賬目，當他每次用尊稱的口吻呌我『陳先生』的時候，我總是對他微笑，點點頭。　　現在和三年前一樣，他每次來仍呌我『陳先生』，我呢，仍對他微笑，點點頭。然而，雙方的心境可變得厲害，在相同地失去了生活的倚持，我是苦惱着有一個家的負擔，他是苦惱着孑然一身，沒有固定的歸宿。他現在雖仍陷落孤境中，『孤兒院』却巳沒有他的份了。他萎靡地走進房裏來，我四他在舖上坐，他沒坐下，便從褲袋裏掏出一疊紙片來，邊檢出那對『職業指導所』的油印信，和一張四號鉛字排印的保證書，留着許多待塡的空白，邊說：『事是我到一樁了，一家新開的內衣　，馬上可影評徵文選映蘇聯三大名片公映地址上海戲院　　第一名三百元　第二名一百五十元　第三名七十五元　　本公司為引起觀衆興趣及增進對蘇聯影片認識起見，特舉辦蘇聯影片批評徵文比賽大會，獎金第一名三百元，第二名一百五十元，第三名七十五元，茲將辦法開列於後。　　一，特選蘇聯名片三部，在四川路上海大戲院公演，每月一部，第一部為「無國遊民」（Gypade），餘片名稱，按月公佈。　　二，徵求評論之影片公演後，觀衆即可應徵，但須於開演後三日內將徵文寄到，各徵文收到後即送交本埠各大報紙每片各選佳作四篇於各該報發表。　　三，迨三片均行公演，即將在各報前後發表之徵文彙訂成冊，分交各評判員評定。　　四，評判委員會由本埠各大報紙，各大文化團體及本公司代表各一人組成之。　　五，徵文請勿署姓名及筆名，而將姓名住址另封與徵文同時寄來，該信封由本公司嚴行保管，僅於信封及徵文上註明號碼以資鑑別而免弊端，微文經評判員判定後即按號啓封，依名次之前後發獎，以昭大公無私。　　六，徵文請寄北四川路上海大戲院收轉。　亞洲影片公司謹啓</p>

<p>以進去的，可是呌我到那兒去打保單呢？還要殷實舖保，』他收拾了其餘的紙片扔進裨袋，接着又說：『陳先生，我這樣一個孤單的人找誰去？唉，唉……』我是明白他的意思了。他的希望的眼睛在向我進逼，我仍躺在藤交椅上，側着頭，心想『怎樣給他說呢？』自己是『心有餘而力不足』。　　『這……這……倒需要想想法子的，……（好一刻的靜默）……　　譬如你院長那裏，他不是社會上很有面子的人嗎！你可以去找他，並且他是有名的慈善家，不至於拒絕你吧？可惜我不能够帮助你，你亦明白我……』　　朱沛生的臉色跟着陽光的隱褪而灰黯了。他左手掌磨擦着右手掌，眼光從我臉上移到他自己的脚上，不息地　着眼睛，跟三年前受着經理斥責時的神情一樣，低着頭，嘴一癟一癟。有着滿肚皮怨氣似的——『不成功呵』，他搖搖頭；『院長不要我見他的面，他恨死了我，時常在同夥面前罵我不長進，沒出息的爛料胚，說我把他面子坍光了，』他又吿訴我，烟廠經理曾把他一點『不名譽事』報知了院長，因此，他將永久地被奚落，被摒棄於生活圈外了，社會眞是神聖不可侵犯的嗎？否則，何以不能寬恕一個孤兒，一個偶然行為失檢的年輕人！名譽，呵呵，這東西是社會的銳齒，多少人被吞噬，永遠地給埋葬了。　　對於眼前的這位舊同事，沒有什麼話可以對他說，自己沒有『身價』『地位』給他做保證，空洞的慰藉，和不切實際的設法，那無異跟他開玩笑。於是，相對地靜默着，靜默着，小窗外的陽光亦完全隱沒了，賣麵包的聲音早已杳然，祇剩下篾籠裏的山蟲呌若牠最後的命運。某夜  費向東　　黃昏是多麼短促呢，從友人家裏辭別出來，他就開始向着回家的路上走；因為窮，連電車也不乘，就這樣在微凉的秋風裏走着，很快地天就完全黑下來了。　　靜寂的衖堂裏，淡黃的燈光照射着水門汀的地板，有幾個好玩的孩子還在這裏捉迷藏。他挨過這些孩子們底身邊，不覺太息了一下：「我底黃金色的童年呢？」那麼自問着拐了彎，轉進自己寄居的那家屋底後門。橫面衝出來的不凑巧正是房東太太——這碩胖的女人，在往日看來蠻可親，而此刻却露出一副兇惡的臉孔，用粗厲的聲音對她底房客討債似地說道：　　「華先生，對不起我底房錢總得勞你付一付了！一共是兩個月，你想想吧，人家底房子可以白白送給你們住的麼？」　　「江太太，眞對不起你……我實在因為……因為……過三五天吧，我準給你設法。」靑年房客冷不防給這麼一問，全身不自主地戰抖起來了，回答的話是吱唔着的。　　「三五天給我設法——華先生你這話說了多少遍啦？我算是客氣的了；要是別人那可不是這樣好商量的呀！」　　「是的……是的！」　　趁着房東太太底身子一側，出門空了一個不很大的縫，他就用非常敏捷的姿勢閃了進去，咚咚地上樓去了。　　當這年靑的房客在後門和房東太太說話的時候，住在三樓前房的妻已經聽見了。她坐在床沿，望着床上熟睡着的孩子，不住地流淚。生活給予她的苦味她是嘗得太多了。現在，丈夫失業，孩子生了病……幸福之門是和他們隔離得那麼遙遠！兩年前，那是他們初婚的時候，一切對於她都是幸福的，誰會想到好日子總是短促的呢？　　聽着丈夫上樓來的脚步聲，她忙拭乾了眼淚。於是門被推開了，他拖着疲倦的身子，跨了進來。兩個人相視默然了一會，他才走近床邊，望了一望閉着雙眼甜睡的孩子。　　他問：「孩子什麼時侯睡去的？沒有什麼異樣吧？」　　「今天下午還算是很好的，」她抬起頭來，向他說道。「睡去不到一刻鐘呢。……你到外邊去借到錢沒有？」　　一提到錢，他底眉頭就緊緊鎖起來了。他吿訴妻說：整天下午他奔跑着，先去找一個在貿易所做事的友人，在寫字間，在他家裏，都沒有會到。他再去找一個舊同學，這傢伙好像早就知道了他底來意似地，儘開口說着窮，說得他啟不了口。他早就想走了，但是那舊同學却又慇　地要他吃一頓晚飯。這樣，他就一直到天黑了才回來……　　妻却把煮好了的飯留起來，等他回來時一同吃。現在他吃過了，那她祇好自己坐到小四方桌那裏去，孤獨地用她底晚餐。可是，她那裏吃得下呢？舉起筷子的時候，又回轉頭來問他道：　　「剛才房東太太又催你付房錢吧？怎麼好呢？」　　是的，怎麼好呢？平常自以為相當能幹的他也沒法來回答了。不過，看着妻底悒鬱的面影，他又只好忍着悽悲來安慰她：「不要緊的，房錢的數目不大，我有辦法的……」　　夜深了，衖堂底周遭更加靜寂，秋風蕭索地吹着，景像顯得悽共。和妻一同躺在床上，眼睛直釘着天花板，覺得夜是那樣長，永無終止似地延續着。還遠地傳來午夜底鐘聲，掠過他底耳邊，又漸漸地消散了。</p>

<h3>Entering Guangxi via the Southern Route: Weng's Troops Began Gradual Withdrawal Yesterday; Cai Tingkai and Li Jishen Flew to Hong Kong; Kawagoe Visited Foreign Minister Zhang Again Yesterday to Discuss the Beihai Incident</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Weng's troops, who entered Guangxi via the southern route, accepted the Li-Bai order and began withdrawing in batches from the 16th. The Beihai incident may not escalate. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yongning: It is confirmed that Cai Tingkai has left Yongning. One account states he actually went to Yulin. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ling Shifen, unable to investigate in Beihai, arrived in Hong Kong on the Fu'an warship on the 15th and transferred to a train to return to the province to report to Diao Zuqian. Diao stated on the 16th that the truth of the Nakano case has not yet been clarified, so there is no way to negotiate. Japanese Deputy Consul-General Yoshitake visited again on the 16th and was informed of this. Currently, the Saga warship is still outside Beihai port and has not sent personnel to land. I have already telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report and will send personnel to investigate after receiving a reply. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sources related to the matter received a telegram on the 16th stating that Ling Shifen, the secretary dispatched by Diao Zuqian to Beihai to investigate the matter, had returned to Guangzhou on the 15th and reported the details of his trip to Diao. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Zhang on the 16th to convey the Japanese government's instructions regarding the Beihai incident, hoping that our government would quickly find a way to allow the investigators sent by the Japanese side to go and investigate. Foreign Minister Zhang agreed to telegraph the Guangdong provincial authorities and asked the Japanese side to wait patiently. No other matters were discussed. He departed at 4:20 PM. It was not determined on the 16th whether Kawagoe would visit Foreign Minister Zhang again on the 17th. Additionally, Japanese Consul-General Suma simultaneously visited Chen Jue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a long discussion about routine cases, departing after one hour. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to news announced today, Cai Tingkai has taken the route through Guangzhou Bay to Hong Kong, and the disposition of his troops has been handed over to Li Zongren, the Pacification Commissioner of Guangxi Province. Therefore, the situation in Beihai has tended to ease considerably. At the same time, according to Chinese sources, Bai Chongxi has accepted Generalissimo Chiang's invitation and abandoned his proposal to go abroad. It is said that Bai has agreed to take the position of Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission as appointed by the central government, and will soon come to Guangzhou to meet Chiang. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe, accompanied by Secretary Shimizu, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM on the 16th to convey the Japanese government's instructions regarding the Beihai incident, hoping that our government would quickly find a way to allow the investigators sent by the Japanese side to go and investigate. Foreign Minister Zhang agreed to telegraph the Guangdong provincial authorities and asked the Japanese side to wait patiently. No other matters were discussed. The Japanese ambassador departed at 4:20 PM. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Ling Shifen, the Chinese official appointed to investigate the Beihai case, has returned here. He has not yet been able to determine the surrounding circumstances of the case. According to Ling, the Japanese authorities requested that the Chinese government appoint a representative to go to Beihai with the Japanese investigators. At the same time, news from Nanning remains optimistic about the current situation. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu all took their new central government-appointed positions today. Deng Shizeng, Chief of Staff of the Guangdong Army, and Cheng Qian, Chief of the General Staff, the government's peace representatives who were sent to Nanning a few days ago, returned to Guangdong by plane today. According to Deng and Cheng, the Guangxi problem has been completely resolved. Bai Chongxi will come to Guangdong soon to meet with Generalissimo Chiang. The reorganization of the province's troops and finances are the most pressing issues for the leaders of Guangxi, and they have decided to start immediately. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) On the 14th, Chiang Kai-shek requested Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi to withdraw Weng Zhaoyuan's troops from the southern route. At the same time, he telegraphed Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong, who are currently in Nanning, to discuss the Beihai incident and the withdrawal of Weng's troops with Li and Bai. Guangxi should implement the compromise conditions established between the central government and Guangxi, and quickly withdraw Weng's troops from the southern route in order to turn the incident into a diplomatic matter, otherwise it would cause a major international dispute. Therefore, Li and Bai acknowledged the need to withdraw Weng's troops on the afternoon of the 15th. (16th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe, who held his first negotiation with Foreign Minister Zhang Qun yesterday, convened military attachés Kita (Army) and Sato (Navy), Consul-General Suma, and resident military attachés Amemiya (Army) and Nakahara (Navy) at his residence at 10:00 AM this morning to explain in detail the negotiations yesterday and to discuss the fundamental policies for the future. (16th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kurasima Shukei, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Isogai, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, on the afternoon of the 15th to exchange views on the Chengdu and Beihai incidents. (16th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Beihai, 13th: Ling Shifen and others arrived in Beihai on the Fu'an warship on the 12th. They landed on a Customs steamer. Weng's troops deployed along the coast and did not allow them to land. Only after Ling and others explained were they allowed to pass. Ling and others returned to the Fu'an because they were unable to investigate and told the Saga warship not to send personnel to land. The Saga is currently docked 7,000 meters offshore from Beihai, waiting for Weng's troops to withdraw before sending personnel to land. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li, Bai, and Huang Sworn into Office; Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong Presided over the Oath-Taking Ceremony and Gave Instructions; Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu Will Fly to Guangdong Today; Bai Chongxi's Trip Eastward Will Be Slightly Delayed</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu were sworn into office on the morning of the 17th. Li also started using the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office and seal. Order has been restored in the counties of Xing'an, Quanxian, Ziguan, and Gongcheng. Martial law has been lifted throughout Guangxi Province, and demobilization orders have also been issued. However, with over 300,000 mobilized, demobilization will still take time. All previously requisitioned vehicles have been returned. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi Provincial Government issued a proclamation opening up the import and export of rice, grain, and other goods. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yongning: Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu were sworn into office at 8:00 AM on the 16th in the assembly hall of the provincial Kuomintang headquarters. Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong presided over the oath-taking ceremony and gave instructions. Li responded, saying that from now on they will certainly unite sincerely, resist every enemy with one heart, realize the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, and complete the National Revolution. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yongning: Bai Chongxi will definitely delay his trip eastward because he has handled Guangxi affairs personally over the years. Now that he has left Guangxi, he urgently needs to deal with them himself, especially the demobilization matters, which need to be presided over by him. Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu will go to Guangdong to meet Generalissimo Chiang for instructions. Li and Huang are scheduled to fly to Guangdong on Ford civilian aircraft with Cheng Qian before noon on the 17th. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi army will be mixed and reorganized with Cai Tingkai's troops into the Fifth Route Army, totaling eight divisions. Guangxi will have five divisions and Cai will have three. Li Zongren will be the commander-in-chief, Deng Shizeng will be the chief of staff, and Wang Zanbin, Qin Lianfang, Su Zuxin, Weng Zhaoyuan, Ou Shounian, Qiu Zhaochen, Zhou Zuhuang, and He Shaozhen are tentatively appointed as division commanders. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Deng Shizeng flew from Yongning to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 15th to report to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Yu Hanmou on his trip to Guangxi. Deng stated that Li, Bai, and Huang took their new positions in Yongning on the morning of the 16th. After Cheng Qian presided over the oath-taking ceremony, he returned to Guangdong with Huang Shaoxiong in the afternoon. Bai also intends to come to meet Chiang, and then, in the name of a Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, go abroad for observation, and then take office in Nanjing. However, Bai needs to stay in Guangxi to assist with the reorganization of the Guangxi army, so it is difficult to determine whether Bai will come together on the 16th. Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai flew from Yongning to Longzhou and then to Hong Kong on the 15th. Li Jishen will also go abroad for a trip before taking office in Nanjing. Cai's troops have been handed over to Li and Bai for handling. Cai's troops who entered the southern route were ordered on the 13th to begin withdrawing from the Guangxi border starting on the 16th. Guangxi's rehabilitation will start with troop reductions and financial reorganization. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lin and Tang Shoumin, from the Kong Xiangxi faction, will go south on the 18th to inspect Guangxi's finances. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yongning: Li Zongren gave a special interview to reporters on the 15th. Director Li was wearing military uniform and long boots, his temples slightly gray, but his heroic spirit was undiminished. The reporter congratulated him, and Li nodded his thanks. The reporter asked if the Commissioner's Office would be moved to Guilin. Li replied, "Indeed. The terrain in Yongning is low-lying and prone to flooding. Guilin is higher and drier, and transportation to the central government is more convenient." The reporter then asked about the demobilization situation. Li said that the order had been issued and was being carried out in various ways. However, the quota for the Guangxi army is only over 20,000 people, and this time more than 300,000 were mobilized, so demobilization will require a lot of expense. Li believes that the allocation of troops in Guangxi Province should be determined according to the intentions and needs of the central government. Guangxi Province has a foundation for local politics, and soldiers can become good citizens after being discharged, so troop reduction is very easy. The reporter then asked about the withdrawal of troops from the southern route and the existence of newly formed troops outside the provincial army. Li said that the southern route troops have been withdrawn on schedule. At this point, Li suddenly told the reporter, "General Cai has already gone to Hong Kong." The reporter asked again to be informed about the existence of Cai's troops. Li replied, "This is only to preserve the country's strength to resist aggression, and the troop quota is actually only one division." Li continued to talk about the administration of Guangxi over the past few years and the issue of international publicity, speaking tirelessly. The reporter was impressed. After talking for two hours, Li kept the reporter talking for another hour because he enjoyed the conversation so much. When the reporter said goodbye, he told Li that the people of the whole country hoped that Director Li would take the opportunity of Generalissimo Chiang's visit to the south to meet with him in Guangdong and asked Director Li to spare some time for a trip. Li gladly said, "If there is an opportunity after the demobilization is completed, I would also like to meet Generalissimo Chiang." Director Li was humble and sincere, and did not leave until the reporter boarded the car. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yongning: Bai Chongxi, the newly appointed Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a special two-hour interview to a Central News Agency reporter on the evening of the 15th. The reporter first expressed his respect and told him that he had listened to his teachings several times at the Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week in the 16th year of the Republic. Ten years have passed, and Commander Bai's heroic posture is still the same, which is truly admirable. Bai raised his head and smiled, as if recalling the situation in Beijing ten years ago. The reporter asked if he would be taking office tomorrow morning. Bai said yes, and that the Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission should not have taken office here originally, but the Generalissimo's intention was like this, so he complied. Regarding the observation abroad, Commander Bai said that this ambition has been nearly ten years, and he still hopes to be able to achieve his wish, hoping to be able to make more contributions to the country in the future. The reporter told him about the expectations of the whole country and asked if he could first go to Nanjing and then plan for a foreign trip. Commander Bai thought for a moment and said, "This idea is very good, but my personal desire for observation is very strong. If the country needs me, I will return immediately." The reporter said, "Then will you make a final decision after meeting with the Generalissimo?" Bai replied, "I should ask for instructions at that time." The reporter then told him that the people of Guangzhou have prepared a warm welcome and asked if he could fly to Guangdong with Commander Cheng immediately. Commander Bai said that he wanted to go east as soon as possible, but Director Li has spent little time in Guangxi in recent years, and all demobilization matters need to be handled by him, so he may have to stay a little longer. The reporter asked if he could decide before taking office tomorrow morning. Bai said that he would have to ask Director Li to decide. Then he talked to the reporter about the news business, his logic was clear, as if he had been engaged in this business. Finally, the reporter said that during the Battle of Longtan, the reporter personally heard the sound of artillery in Nanjing, and ultimately relied on Commander Bai to command the elite troops and Minister He to attack and annihilate the enemy, and the new capital of the revolution was turned from danger to safety. To this day, the citizens of the capital still praise and have not forgotten. I hope that Commander Bai will use the spirit of defending the capital in those years and the experience of administering Guangxi over the years to assist the Generalissimo in leading comrades across the country, defending the nation, and governing the country. The citizens of the capital will surely come out in droves to welcome him, and the people of the whole country are even more hopeful. I earnestly hope that Commander Bai will comfort them. Commander Bai seemed very excited when he heard the reporter's words, smiled and nodded, and recounted the events of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic to the reporter. Commander Bai was wearing cloth shoes and leggings, gentle and humble, seemingly better than his previous intelligence and competence, which can be seen in his clear and sharp eyes. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiang Hanping said on the 16th that Bai Chongxi has decided to stay in Guangxi to reorganize the troops. After completing this next month, he will go abroad for observation. Li Pinsian, Xia Wei, Wei Yunsong, Liao Lei and others will form an observation group and travel together. Bai will definitely come to meet Chiang before going abroad. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu plan to fly to Guangdong on the 17th to meet with Chiang and ask for instructions. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: According to a telegram from Nanning, Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai suddenly flew to Hong Kong on the 15th. When Cai left, he told reporters in Nanning that the troops under his command were entrusted to Li and Bai. (16th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Illicit salt transported to Tianjin from eastern Hebei is being dumped in Tianjin, using a certain concession as a stronghold, at a price of 14 catties per yuan.

(16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tashiro and Hashimoto Convene an Important Meeting on the Current Situation; Military Attachés from Various Regions and Senior Staff from the Military Participate; Strengthening Policies Towards China is the Focus of Discussion</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 1:00 PM on the 16th, Tashiro and Hashimoto convened an important meeting on the current situation. Participants included Kawabe, Mutaguchi, Suzuki, Kayashima, Shinabe, Kagawa, Ikeda, Ichiki, Kimoto, troop leaders and regimental commanders from various garrisons, and military attachés Matsumuro, Imai, Hamada, and Hosoki. Staff officers from the garrisons, including Iida, Wachi, Ikeda, Asai, and Senta, representatives from the Ministry of the Army Koizumi and Nakamura, representatives from the Kwantung Army Tanaka, and over 40 other people. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM and will continue on the 17th. The matters discussed on the 15th included mobilization during a state of emergency, enhancing the mission of the garrison troops, strengthening policies towards North China, promoting the clarification of the current regime. In addition, the final policies regarding the situations in Hebei-Chahar, eastern Hebei, and eastern Suiyuan were discussed. Economic development issues related to Kwantung and military affairs were also given special consideration. Koizumi and Nakamura reported the intentions of the Ministry of the Army, and Tanaka stated the Kwantung Army's support for the plans of the North China Military Department. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major General Koizumi and Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura, attached to the Ministry of the Army, arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 16th, having traveled from the Northeast. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Whether the puppet organization in eastern Hebei will be abolished depends on the results of this important meeting between the Japanese sides in Tianjin. The North China and Kwantung armies seem to have conflicting opinions on this matter. Wachi, a staff officer of the Japanese military in Tianjin, is the strongest advocate for abolition. Yin Rugeng is waiting for news in Tianjin for this reason. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities have determined that economic development in North China should be accepted under two basic conditions: it should be beneficial to us and to them, or beneficial to them and not detrimental to us. They hope that the other party will create a plan to gradually implement this, to avoid insatiable demands. However, the other party's military department is unwilling to directly present any plans, as it would seem to interfere with the responsibilities of the embassy and does not want to create a plan that restricts itself. Kawagoe went to Nanjing to discuss this with us. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawabe returned to Beiping with his adjutant Noguchi after the meeting in Tianjin on the 16th. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kawabe, the commander of the Japanese garrison brigade in Beiping, and Mutaguchi, the commander of the infantry, went to Tianjin to participate in the military attaché meeting of the Tianjin Japanese garrison. This evening, he led 22 junior military attachés from Tianjin to Beiping. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Visits Zhang Hu; There are Rumors that Zhang Hu or Li Sihao Will Succeed as Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee; Qin Dechun Did Not Meet with Wang Kemin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan visited former Minister of Finance Zhang Hu on Akiba Street in the Japanese concession at 3:00 PM on the 16th. Chen Juesheng accompanied him. They talked for about an hour. Song will host a banquet for Zhang in the next few days. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee, has firmly resigned. It is widely rumored that Zhang Hu or Li Sihao, the general manager of the Shanghai Bank of China, will succeed him.

<h3>Li Zongren and Others Take Office</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu took office in Yongning yesterday as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner, Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, respectively, positions to which they were recently appointed by the National Government. Cheng Qian, a special envoy from the central government, presided over the oath-taking ceremony. This symbolizes the elimination of the deep-seated separation between the central government and Guangxi. In today's precarious national situation, this is especially worthy of our celebration.</p>
<p>Li Zongren and others taking office could be foreseen when the National Government issued its new order on the 6th. However, everyone knows that the Guangxi issue is quite complex, especially the two incidents of restoring the 19th Route Army and the killing of Japanese in Beihai that have occurred in the past month, which have added many difficulties to the resolution of the Guangxi issue. Now Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai have gone to Hong Kong to recuperate and have handed over the troops under their command to Li and Bai. Weng Zhaoyuan's troops are also preparing to withdraw from Beihai before the 20th. And Li Zongren and others took their new positions at this time. The Chinese people's hidden worries about the Guangxi issue can therefore be largely dispelled.</p>
<p>The Guangxi issue was able to comply with the psychology of the people of the whole country and achieve a peaceful resolution without shedding a drop of blood. This seems to have to be attributed to the central government's magnanimity and tolerance and the "selfless" spirit of the military leaders of Guangxi. On the central government side, Generalissimo Chiang has always adopted a magnanimous and frank attitude towards Guangxi and never haggled over past grievances. He repeatedly sent representatives to communicate with Li and Bai, with the sole purpose of completing the unification of the whole country in a peaceful manner. On the Guangxi side, although the military leaders such as Li and Bai were previously dissatisfied with the central government and had expressed dissenting intentions, the political views they put forward have always been based on the safety of the country and the nation. Therefore, they can gain the understanding of the central government and can accept the new order of the central government after understanding the sincerity of the central government.</p>
<p>What has been said above is only the superficial reason. If we want to know why the Guangxi issue is tending towards a peaceful resolution, it is actually determined by the current objective environment in China. Originally, China is a large and poor country, and it is very difficult for the central and local authorities to agree on opinions in politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. This is why it was not easy to complete the unified situation in the past. However, the crises that the country has encountered in the past five years have made the people of the whole country unanimously realize what the most urgent problem is at present. For the sake of the safety of the entire country and the entire nation, they must abandon all other biased views and unite to deal with this only problem. This kind of popular psychology is actually the main key to the smooth resolution of the deeply entrenched Guangxi situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the taking office of Li Zongren and others not only represents the completion of the final link in unification, but also represents that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country are prepared to unite to deal with the most urgent problem currently facing China.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee was established on the 16th. (Special dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chiang Kai-shek's address to the inauguration ceremony of the Guangdong Provincial Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee on September 16th, titled "The Essential Tasks of the National Economic Construction Movement in Guangdong," is recorded below. Chiang Kai-shek deeply believes that the fundamental crisis in China today lies in the decline of the national economy. People cannot fully exert their strength, land cannot be developed for its benefits, and industry and commerce cannot fully utilize their supply and circulation functions, causing the national strength to weaken and the national situation to be in danger. The survival of the nation has no guarantee. If we do not concentrate the manpower and wisdom of the whole country to catch up quickly and seek to save the situation, the revolution will be empty talk, and the people's difficulties will have no way to be relieved. Therefore, in August of last year, I telegraphed the authorities of various provinces to promote the National Economic Construction Movement. In October, I further elaborated on its purpose to arouse the attention of the people. Over the past year, due to the concerted efforts of the government and the people, this movement has progressed from the stage of official promotion and discussion to the completion of national organizations at all levels. The Guangdong Provincial Branch is also announcing its establishment today, when the revolutionary base has been re-established. From now on, the government and the people will work together to seek the development of the province's economy and the improvement of the people's lives. The establishment of a model province of the Three People's Principles and a new Guangdong must begin with this. However, any movement has its universal goals, and it must also have its specific priorities that suit the facts of the time and place. Regarding the current situation and needs of Guangdong Province, I will briefly mention the key points of the future work, and I hope that all compatriots and comrades in the province will pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>First, the movement should strive for universality. The implementation items of national economic construction have a wide scope and complex content. The work is indeed extremely difficult. It is not possible to accomplish it solely by relying on the government's promotion. It is necessary to first conduct in-depth propaganda among the people to awaken the widespread self-awareness of the general public. All aspects of changing the people's habit of neglecting production, eliminating superstitious and conservative ideas, explaining the necessity of various local economic constructions, and assisting the government in implementing economic construction policies, as well as improving production methods and management methods, must be deeply understood by the people, and they must be guided to participate universally and actively in order to promote them to the fullest extent. In the past, the compatriots in Guangdong Province have suffered greatly from oppression and deception. It is even more necessary to dispel their doubts and worries and promote their automatic awareness through sincere persuasion and widespread propaganda. This work depends on the public associations to lead the intellectuals of the province in enthusiastic persuasion and widespread propaganda. All levels of party, government, and military organs and civil servants in the province should set an example and take on the responsibility of official guidance at any time and any place in order to gather the enthusiasm of the people of the province and unite the full strength of the people from all walks of life in agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia to cooperate in division of labor and proceed consistently within the scope of government laws and policies to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Second, advocate thrift and cultivate the people's habit of diligence and production. This is the primary task in the National Economic Construction Movement. The biggest crisis in our national economic life today lies in the backwardness of production. Everything is inferior to others, while in terms of consumer goods, we strive for luxury and are unrestrained, resulting in the outflow of money and the depletion of resources. The weakness of the country and the poverty of the people are all due to this. Therefore, if the habits of extravagance and waste are not changed, we will forever suffer the pain of being exploited and have no way to improve ourselves. The most important plan to seek improvement must be to advocate thrift and encourage savings. Whether it is production or consumption, we should strive to comply with the principles of economic rationality, obtain the greatest effect with the least consumption, and make the best use of everything. Saving one cent of waste is equivalent to saving one cent of savings. If individuals can practice thrift, they can increase their production activities. If a family can practice thrift, they can increase their production capacity. If everyone in every county in the province can practice thrift, not only can they reduce unnecessary consumption, but also completely eradicate the bad habits of extravagance, waste, idleness, and frivolity, then the increase in the productivity of the entire society will be immeasurable. Moreover, the so-called productivity, in a broad sense, is not limited to materials and money, but also includes human labor and the time of potential labor. All those who can truly practice thrift must live frugally and be full of energy. They can not only increase the money and materials needed for production invisibly due to the reduction of consumption, but also know how to save their energy and time to engage in various production constructions. This is especially important for our compatriots in Guangdong Province. The customs of Guangdong Province are more accustomed to extravagance and waste than other provinces. Without discussing other aspects, just the bad habits of opium, gambling, and prostitution that fill the province have consumed an unknown amount of manpower and financial resources, and the extravagance of daily food and drink of people in the cities exceeds the ordinary and reasonable limits, which is enough to be shocking. If we can make up our minds to eliminate the old habits, practice thrift, advocate diligence, and transfer useful money to meet the needs of production, and save wasted time to work for production, then with the richness of natural resources and the abundance of manpower and material resources in Guangdong Province, it can directly surpass foreign countries, not to mention being the best in the country. Therefore, the primary and urgent task of the National Economic Construction Movement in this province is to eliminate idleness and extravagance in the negative aspect, and to advocate hard work and practice thrift in the positive aspect. Diligence will prevent scarcity, and thrift will cultivate integrity. The simplicity of folk customs and the abundance of people's livelihood will all begin with this.</p>
<p>Third, welcome overseas Chinese investment to develop local construction projects. Guangdong Province is located in the southern border, with convenient transportation to foreign countries. The general character of the people is rich in the spirit of adventure and enterprising. They often leave the country at a young age and go to Southeast Asia and Europe and the United States to work hard and accumulate huge amounts of money. The funds remitted back to the country every year are an important component of making up for the trade deficit. Overseas Chinese compatriots are far away in foreign countries but do not forget their motherland. Many people have been longing to return home for years in their places of residence. Because their hometown politics are dark, they have not moved forward. Now domestic production and construction are suffering from a lack of funds and talents. If Guangdong Province can widely advocate, solicit funds, give them preferential treatment, and provide them with guarantees after the administration is rectified, and appeal to their feelings for their homeland with sincerity, everyone will respond enthusiastically. Loving the hometown and loving the country are the same, and they will be happy to operate in other towns and villages. Guangdong Province has so many overseas Chinese compatriots, so there is no need to worry about the lack of capital and manpower for economic construction. It is up to those who preside over the National Economic Construction Movement in Guangdong Province to make good use of the unique advantages of this province, pay close attention to it, and make practical efforts. Fourth, protect the safety of investment and assist people in their management to promote the development of industry. The depth of the economic foundation of Guangdong Province and the superiority of private wealth surpass all provinces in the country, but all public and private industries have not been able to develop healthily because the local government in the past lacked proper and sound policies. Not only did it not provide protection for private investment, but it even levied excessive taxes and suppressed and devastated it. In the future, we should strive to correct this malpractice and strictly abide by the principles of the People's Livelihood advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. On the one hand, the people must assist the government in developing national capital to promote large-scale material construction. On the other hand, the government must protect and encourage the progress of private investment to promote the development of national economic construction. Especially for the people's investment in production businesses, we should provide detailed guidance and various assistance. What kind of business is suitable for large-scale investment, and how to operate it can achieve healthy development. We should give detailed and comprehensive guidance and assistance based on the research and design of experts. This requires the government to preside over it at the top, and it also depends on the enthusiastic support of intellectuals and experts in general to be successful. As for the reorganization and unification of the currency system and the improvement and rectification of donations and taxes, they are all intended to directly and indirectly encourage people's investment and promote the development of industry, and we must concentrate our efforts to plan for them. The above four points are considered in light of the current needs of Guangdong Province, and they are listed as the priorities for the first efforts. Other general implementation methods and work steps for promoting the National Economic Construction Movement have been explained in detail in my past documents and speeches. The General Assembly also has compilations. At the beginning of the province's implementation, I hope that the responsible personnel will consult in detail and study them to use them as the basis for propaganda and guidance. As for the work of the branches and local governments, I hope that they will implement them earnestly in accordance with the existing regulations to achieve consistent progress. In short, if we want to build Guangdong into a model province of the Three People's Principles to consolidate the revolution and complete the great cause of rejuvenation, we must promote the foundation of national economic construction in this province as much as possible to achieve complete success, so that we can teach and enrich the people without distinction between first and last, and both the people's livelihood and the national economy will benefit. I hope that the authorities and all compatriots in Guangdong Province will work together to achieve this. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>US Secretary of State Delivers Speech on Good Neighbor Policy, Deeply Regrets the Disregard of the Sacred Treaty, Advocating for the Transformation of International Trade to Eliminate Discord</h3>
<p>(New York) Secretary of State Hull delivered a speech at the annual dinner of the Good Neighbor Association tonight, stating that the United States is prepared to reciprocate with mutual harmony and implement all attempts to limit armaments. The so-called good neighbor is the giving and taking in our common life, which is always mixed together. President Roosevelt's governance has always taken the good neighbor policy as its main principle. Now, several strong countries are taking the opportunity to disregard the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is regrettable. The common countries are now continuing to work to establish security through new treaties. This new treaty must be more durable than the treaties that have already been broken. The US government is willing to welcome the success of this move. Hull then advocated for the revival of international trade, saying that the reconstruction of international trade is sufficient to give governments an excellent opportunity to improve the living conditions of their people and obtain the necessary means to purchase the necessities of happiness and the raw materials necessary for manufacturing. If such a result can be achieved, one of the main causes of discord and possible war can be eliminated. Hull's speech was broadcast nationwide by radio. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ministry of the Army's Outline of National Defense Plan, Completion of Military Build-up in Six Years Requires 3.3 Billion Yen, Budget Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army's budget for the next year and the outline of its six-year national defense plan were submitted to the Ministry of Finance on the 15th. This time, the Army's budget includes an unprecedented national defense plan, and this permanent plan is its major feature. Initially, the national defense plan drafted by the General Staff based on the international situation required an expenditure of 10 billion yen. However, after careful review by the military and political authorities, it was decided to implement a six-year plan of 3.3 billion yen, and the 300 million yen required in the first year is to achieve the four major goals of (1) increasing air and air defense forces, (2) strengthening troops stationed in Manchuria, (3) enriching combat data, and (4) improving general military equipment. The Army authorities claimed that this plan is the first step in building a permanent military build-up to cope with the international situation, and this budget is the minimum limit that the Army should demand, and it is absolutely indispensable to fulfill the mission of national defense. The authorities have a strong determination to require the Ministry of Finance to approve the overall plan. The content of the Ministry of the Army's budget for the next year is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Base budget: 33.6 million yen, (2) Manchurian Incident expenses: 16.6 million yen, (3) First year of the new national defense plan: 30 million yen, for a total of 82.2 million yen. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decides to Revamp Diplomatic Lineup, Summons Ambassadors to Europe Back Home, Nanyang Section to Be Established Next Month</h3>

<h3>Conflicting Opinions Between Army and Cabinet on Japan's Diplomatic Policy Towards Russia, One Advocating Toughness and One Advocating Caution</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to take advantage of the retirement of Ota Kiyoshi and the upcoming appointment of Shigemitsu Mamoru to comprehensively decide on its diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union. Terauchi, the Minister of the Army, and the young officers are yearning for the glory of Japan's victory during the Russo-Japanese War. They still strongly advocate expanding military equipment in Manchuria, demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops stationed in the Far East, and vigorously promoting the special situation in North China and establishing a Far East and Soviet Union alliance to achieve the goal of occupying Siberia. However, Maba, the Minister of Finance, and the industrial capitalists advocate caution, considering the Soviet Union's proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty and first resolve the outstanding issues of oil and fishery. This is because the situation of domestic financial bankruptcy and people's impoverished lives during the previous Russo-Japanese War is still vivid in their minds, and the current domestic situation is indeed a hundred times more difficult than it was then. Judging from the current situation, the military faction that insists on tough demands is more dominant. Therefore, the future of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is difficult to have the hope of clarification. (China United Press dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Terauchi Plans to Request the Government to Fundamentally Reform the Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The military has always advocated the fundamental reform of the administrative structure, including (1) reducing the number of ministers of state, (2) establishing ministers without portfolio, and (3) expanding the investigation bureau to fundamentally reform the cabinet system. The government considers this impossible from the perspective of legal theory and practical issues, and only takes the establishment of the Trade Bureau and the abolition or merger of bureaus and sections as reform items. The Army is dissatisfied with the government's attitude and Terauchi, the Minister of the Army, is determined to submit a concrete proposal to the government and demand its implementation. The timing will be before the Army holds its autumn exercises. The government's attitude towards this matter is unknown. The issue of reforming the administrative organs and the issue of military budget are currently the most important issues in the political world, and their future is quite noteworthy.

<h3>US Department of Agriculture Releases Report on Progress in China's Sugar Production, Imports of Foreign Goods Decreasing Year by Year, Smuggling in North China Affecting Domestic Production</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Department of Agriculture today released its latest report on China's sugar production. It is reported that in recent years, China's sugar production has increased compared to the past, because the Chinese government has actively encouraged the planting of sugarcane, purchased more sugarcane seeds with higher sugar content from the Philippines and Java, assisted rural lending institutions, guaranteed sugarcane prices, handled sugar production monopolies, and increased import tariffs on sugar, so sugar production has greatly progressed. However, for several months, according to a report by Rosig, Assistant Commissioner of the US Department of Agriculture stationed in Shanghai, a large amount of smuggled sugar has been imported from North China. If it cannot be prohibited, it may have an adverse effect on the expansion of sugarcane production. The number of acres planted with sugarcane is currently not statistically accurate, and it varies from year to year. Roughly, it is between 400,000 and 500,000 acres, and the total sugar production is 6.7 million tons. In South China, foreign varieties have recently been intermittently adopted. Last year, foreign sugarcane in Guangdong accounted for about 6%, and Guangxi also produced a small amount of planting. Compared with other countries in Asia, the cost of sugarcane planting in China is actually higher due to unsuitable climate, poor selection of seeds, and insufficient fertilizer. Therefore, the Chinese government deeply feels that it must increase import tariffs to protect domestic production. According to the situation, China's sugar production has always been lacking. Between 1928 and 1930, it imported 900,000 tons annually, ranking fourth among sugar-importing countries in the world. However, it has gradually decreased in recent years. Last year, it only imported 287,128 tons, while domestic sugar production reached 433,225 tons. As for the total amount of consumption, it is difficult to calculate. Between 1921 and 1930, sugar prices were very low, and consumption also increased. In 1931, sugar prices increased, and consumption decreased. From 1926 to 1930, excluding Manchuria, the national average annual consumption was 1.1 million tons, which is more than five pounds per person. After the increase in taxes, a lot of smuggled sugar was imported. The smuggled sugar imports between 1929 and 1935 were mostly transported from the Philippines and Java to the provinces of South China. Since last winter, smuggling in North China has been rampant, and domestic sugar production has been more affected. However, the Chinese government still intends to maintain tax rates and stop smuggling, and South China will still consider encouraging increased sugar production.

<h3>Maine Election Results Announced: Republican Party Achieves Major Victory; General Election Situation Remains Uncertain</h3>
<p>Portland, USA – The results of the Maine state elections for Senator, Representatives, and Governor have been fully revealed. News of a major Republican victory has been confirmed. The Republican candidate for Senator, the incumbent Senator White, secured 159,484 votes, winning re-election. The Democratic candidate, the incumbent Governor Brann, received 154,403 votes. As for the gubernatorial election, the Republican candidate Barrows obtained 172,511 votes, while the Democratic candidate Hubbard garnered only 132,783 votes. The Republican candidate was also elected as a Representative for the state’s third district. For the past two years, the Representatives from that district have been Democrats. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Portland, Maine, USA – Yesterday's voting results for the Maine Senate election show a victory for the Republican Party. As a result, the Republican Party has won a Senate seat and the governorship of the state. This Maine Senate election is generally considered a barometer for the general election in November of this year. It is not difficult to predict who will win or lose between the Republicans and Democrats in the November general election based on the results of this election. The incumbent Governor of Maine, Brann, is a Democrat, and the incumbent Senator White is a Republican. In this election, the Republican Party nominated White as the Senate candidate and Barrows as the gubernatorial candidate. The Democratic Party nominated the incumbent Governor Brann as the Senate candidate and DuBauer as the gubernatorial candidate. Although the Republican Party won the Senate election yesterday, White only received 5,000 more votes than Brann. According to political experts, the Republican Party needs to secure a majority of 45,000 votes in the Maine election to have a good chance of winning the November general election. Since the current majority is far from that, Democratic President Roosevelt may still have hope of winning re-election. In other words, the situation in the November general election remains uncertain. The reason for Republican Senate candidate White's election victory is that he received support from farmers, while Democratic candidate Brann received more votes in major cities. Moreover, the governorship of Maine has been held by the Democratic Party for four years, but now it has been taken over by the Republican Party. Republican presidential candidate Landon recently delivered an important speech criticizing President Roosevelt's New Deal. According to Republican sources, the Republican Party's victory in the Maine election is largely due to Landon's speech. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Approaching: Revision of the Covenant as the Main Agenda; Argentina Decides to Send a Representative</h3>
<p>(London) The annual General Assembly of the League of Nations is imminent. The most important agenda item of this session is the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. Political figures here feel that it is difficult to expect the discussion of this issue at the Assembly to produce practical results. This can be seen from the difficulties in preparing for the Locarno Five-Power Conference. The British side insists that resolving Germany's relationship with the League of Nations is a prerequisite for revising the Covenant. However, Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations is still unclear. Therefore, there is little hope of success in discussing the revision of the Covenant at the League of Nations Assembly. However, political figures believe that the British delegation attending the League of Nations Assembly may still put forward some technical and theoretical suggestions, such as taking into account regional interests when dealing with violations of the Covenant by member states, and advocating that the League of Nations should set up a special committee to be responsible for studying the overall issue of revising the Covenant.

In addition to Eden as the chief representative, there are also the Lord Privy Seal Viscount Halifax, Foreign Office official Viscount Cranborne, and Dominion Minister MacDonald. It is reported that the representative of Abyssinia will attend the League of Nations meeting, but it seems that Italy will not be absent because of this. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Southern Route of Spanish Rebel Army Reinforced: Preparing to Attack Madrid; Coast of the Bay of Biscay Blockaded; City of Bilbao Becomes a World of Terror</h3>
<p>Seville – The National Army authorities here recently issued a war report stating that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route, is still transferring fresh troops from the Moroccan territory to the country to assist in the war. The National Army on the Northern Route defeated a column of government troops in the province of Asturias. General Mola, the commander-in-chief of that route, recently allowed his subordinates to take four days of rest in shifts in order to recuperate and launch a large-scale attack on the city of Madrid two weeks later. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Because the Guadarrama Mountains and El Barco serve as barriers for Madrid, making it difficult to attack, the rebel army is now launching a vigorous flanking attack on Talavera, 26 miles north of Toledo, hoping to directly attack the capital from the side. The government army has been sparing no effort to reinforce that area for three days. Today, a large number of militia members are still pouring out of the capital. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>San Sebastián – Today, the rebel army leaders blockaded the cities of Bilbao and Santander along the coast of the Bay of Biscay, in an attempt to force the 400,000 soldiers and civilians in the cities to surrender to the rebel army due to hunger. At the same time, the rebel army has also warned foreign ships to leave the two cities by noon today. At that time, the rebel army will use mines to destroy the two ports and will use warships to patrol the coast. According to refugees, the city of Bilbao has become a world of terror because all the anarchist parties have been armed. People are killed in the streets every day, typhoid fever is prevalent, and there is an imminent danger of food shortages. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Burgos – The military government of the National Army formally notified various shipping companies this morning that the ports of Bilbao and Santander have been mined since 1:00 AM on September 17, and ordered all ships coming and going to pay attention. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>

After the capture of Toledo, the capital can be taken without a fight. In addition, the National Army issued a message from the Tatuan radio station, stating that the National Army can now mobilize 170,000 troops to attack Madrid, while the total number of soldiers deployed by the National Army reaches 500,000, and within a month, new recruits can be trained to increase the number to 1 million.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Leader Flirts with Germany: Expressing Gratitude for Sympathy and Assistance; Willing to Serve as the Western Vanguard Against Communism</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Gabannelas, Chairman of the National Defense Committee of the National Army Government in Burgos, Spain, recently issued a letter to the German people to a special correspondent of the German News Agency, which reads: "General Gabannelas, Chairman of the National Defense Committee of Spain, announces to the German people that the Spanish people are now fighting to protect their motherland and to oppose the destruction of anarchy and communism. They have received the friendly sympathy and spiritual assistance from the German people, and the Spanish people will never forget it. What is the significance of our efforts to resist the tide of communism and Marxism? Only the German people who can shoulder the mission of history know it best. Whenever the most difficult period in history comes, God must order Spain to protect Europe from the invasion of barbaric forces. Today's events are the same. The disciples of Moscow want to enslave the whole world, and your leaders and people have stepped forward to serve as the vanguard of the East. Now we are also willing to serve as the vanguard of the West, because in this autumn of crisis for Europe, the western vanguard is as important as the eastern vanguard." (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>If the Spanish Revolution Succeeds, Military Dictatorship Will Be Implemented</h3>
<p>General Mola's Remarks</p>
<p>Burgos – General Mola, the commander of the rebel army in northern Spain, spoke here today, confidently asserting that the future of Spain will have a new look. Mola declared that the generation of people who caused Spain to lose its colonial status have spent their years in unnecessary grief and used sophistry to cover up their own mistakes. The aspirations of the young volunteers now are to create a unified and strong Catholic Spain and restore its position in the era of Catholic victory. Mola also warned the country that after this victory, due to the nature of the current problems and intellectual relations, all construction work should be undertaken by the military.

<h3>Hitler's Anti-Communist Remarks: Attempting to Disrupt the Collective Security System; Russian Newspaper Criticizes Vigorously; British Public Opinion Also Unfavorable</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Izvestia newspaper published an editorial entitled "Dancing with a Torch on a Powder Keg," summarizing the Nuremberg Congress of the German Nazi Party, saying: "From the howling of Nuremberg, we can analyze two main tones. On the one hand, it conceals the domestic news and makes people ignore the domestic unrest, the lack of food, unemployment, poverty, bankruptcy, and other disasters that swept in. On the other hand, it uses the madness of Fascist war preparations to demonstrate, and its huge military preparations to intimidate and threaten neighboring countries. For domestic affairs, Nuremberg should be a particularly heavy new anesthetic, and for foreign affairs, it is a blackmailing threat."</p>
<p>Izvestia then briefly described Hitler's speech and the German economic situation, pointing out that Hitler has completely admitted his old slogan "We want guns, not butter," denouncing the proposal to increase wages and reduce working hours as nonsense, and talking about economic prosperity, while in reality, the people are suffering endless pain. Nuremberg has announced the second "Four-Year Plan," making Germany no longer dependent on foreign raw materials. The chemical four-year plan still has no butter, fat, or meat, but it is called "in order to prevent disappointment."</p>
<p>"Thus, not only is the result completely clear, but the prospect has also been decided in advance." The first four years had robbed Germany to feed Krupp, and the second "Four-Year Plan" will allow the "dye trust" to monopolize the spoils. The focus of the Nuremberg farce is definitely not on the exhibition of Hitlerian economic theory, but on the launch of propaganda and aggression. For this reason, although professional German diplomats have repeatedly offered advice, Hitler still boldly declared his demand for colonies, causing great unease to the friends of the Third Reich in Britain. Hitler was so proud that he even daydreamed that he needed Soviet territory in order to create a "paradise" within Germany, including not only Ukraine, but even the Urals and Siberia, no more, no less. This kind of absurd dream can only be made by a madman whose mind is completely blinded by the desire for robbery and plunder.</p>
<p>"Since Hitler is like this, it is not surprising that his assistants Goebbels and Rosenberg follow suit like mad dogs running with broken chains. This kind of gangster trick, this kind of tone, this kind of massacre manufacturer is only seen in international history. From the venom of this kind of mad dog, the delirium of this kind of heatstroke, and this kind of slanderous remarks, we can only draw one conclusion: that they are volunteering to be the vanguard of the crusade against the Soviet Union." However, do you think that the only path for the expansion of German fascism is eastward? Be careful not to be complacent. You must know that the main purpose of this batch of howls and jokes in Nuremberg is to destroy the established collective security system in Europe at all costs. The main target of all the anger of this batch of war-mongers is the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, and the established goal of German fascism is to destroy the Soviet-Czech Pact at any cost, isolate the Czech Republic in order to annex it, consolidate its Central European position in order to insert a sharp knife into the heart of France, and then further threaten Britain with an ultimatum to fight for colonies and resolutely demand the sacrifice of Britain to redistribute the world. Do you not believe it? The Fascists have already declared it today. All of this is based on a frank plan for a fully armed military fortress in the heart of Europe and has begun to be implemented.</p>
<p>"The poisonous claws of German imperialism are currently active in Spain. Hitler has copied to the rear of France, and at the same time, he is joining hands with Italian Fascism to plan to aim his cannons at Gibraltar. Europe will eat its consequences. Goebbels and Rosenberg are seeking help from Britain, to those who still firmly believe in the fixed methods of traditional British diplomacy, which is to sacrifice third parties to make concessions to aggressors. Goebbels and Rosenberg are also seeking help from France, attempting to inject the mentality of the Coblenz (a province of Germany in the Rhineland) expatriates into modern France, they are not only willing to sacrifice third countries, but also willing to sacrifice the vast masses of their own country in order to make any concessions to German Fascism. Fascist bandits are begging for help from all those who continue to play Spiridon games. They have created new theories such as so-called "guiding aggression to others" and "localizing the war." This kind of means is not a witty idea, nor is it witty diplomacy, it is just a development of Hitler's "Mein Kampf." The step-by-step plan and stages for implementing robbery in that book have long been explained in detail. "Nuremberg is actually an unseemly prelude to the Locarno Five-Power Conference. Fascist Germany has methodically uprooted the root of the conference. The reasonable question now is how the Soviet Union will deal with this bloody religious drama. The hundreds of millions of people in the Soviet Union are now working hard on creative work as usual. The construction and strengthening of our country's socialism will never stop for a moment. Our country's cause is more meaningful than the howling of Nuremberg by hundreds of millions of times."</p>
<p>The editorial of the Pravda newspaper briefly stated, "The anti-Soviet ravings of the Nuremberg Congress have had the exact opposite result. The speeches of Hitler and Goebbels have completely exposed the mask of verbal peace from the war attempts of German fascism. The naked aggressor and war-monger face of Fascist Germany has been completely exposed to the world. The stage manager of the Congress has suffered a shameful failure." (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Observers here have a very unfavorable impression of the recent speech by German leader Hitler at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, which fiercely attacked the Soviet Union. It is believed that it is enough to hinder the progress of the Locarno Conference, because both Britain and France want to find a way to establish a European sky security pact at the Locarno Conference. Now, if Hitler wants to exclude the Soviet Union from the negotiations, then this sky pact is unlikely to succeed. Responsible parties generally believe that if the Locarno Conference wants to be convened, it will still take "considerable" time, or six weeks, to make the necessary preparations, and this conference must not exclude any major powers, and there should be no exceptions to any issues concerning Europe, all of which should be put forward for discussion.

<h3>Locarno Conference: Date of Convocation Undecided; Both Italy and Germany Advocate Postponing the Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The Locarno Pact powers, namely the conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium, have not yet decided on a date for the meeting despite a long period of diplomatic negotiations. The first task of the meeting will be to draft a new agreement to replace the Locarno Rhineland Pact, which was criticized by German leader Hitler earlier this year. The British government has now suggested holding the meeting in late October, which is expected to be agreed upon by the French and Belgian governments. It is reported that the two governments will also agree to hold the meeting in London, but the Italian and German governments still want to postpone the opening. According to the German response, there is not enough time in October to continue discussing preparatory matters. Italy has declared that diplomatic exchanges should continue before a definite date for the meeting is decided. Judging from the above situation, the date of the meeting still needs to be discussed before a decision can be made, but it is expected that the issue will not be difficult to resolve. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The British government previously invited Italy to send representatives to the five-power conference of the Locarno Treaty to be held in London. Today, the Italian government has notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Inglan, stating that Italy accepts Britain's invitation in principle, but with the condition that preparatory negotiations should be conducted through diplomatic channels before the five-power conference is held.

<h3>Italian-Austrian Talks Underway: Generally Considered to Have Important Political Implications; Seeking to Draw the Little Entente Countries into the Group</h3>
<p>(Rome) Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt came to Italy yesterday and held talks with Foreign Minister Count Ciano and Prime Minister Mussolini. Although the officials have taken a reserved attitude towards the content of the talks, it is generally believed to have important political implications. It is rumored that after Schmidt's visit to Italy, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg may follow suit and come to Rome for a visit. As for the talks between Schmidt and Mussolini today, they were probably discussing how to make Austria take on the responsibility of liaison between Italy, the countries of the Little Entente, and Germany. Observers here believe that the improvement of relations between Italy and the three countries of the Little Entente and the signing of the Czech-Austrian Commercial Agreement (the Czech Republic and Austria signed a commercial agreement on April 4 this year to promote trade between the two countries) are originally different paths leading to the same goal. The economic cooperation between the countries of the Little Entente and the countries joining the Rome Group should take the Czech-Austrian Commercial Agreement as its starting point. Moreover, the recent changes in Romanian foreign policy have shown a tendency to approach Germany and Italy, and the commercial negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia are also in progress. If so, the connection between the Little Entente and the Rome Group will inevitably become closer and closer. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>

After holding a meeting last night, the representatives of the factories agreed to accept the suggestions of the management and decided to resume work immediately. This morning, the textile workers' union in the Nord province refused to consider extending the strike in order to eliminate French Prime Minister Blum, Interior Minister Salengro, and Minister without Portfolio Juddin, who will meet with the labor and management representatives of the Lille area separately today. It is expected that the government will propose an arbitration method at that time. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>Various Perspectives on the Mediation of the Guangxi Situation</p>
<p>Liu Weizhang Returns to Guangxi with the Seals of the Fifth Route Army; the Central Government Decides to Incorporate Cai Tingkai's Troops into the Guangxi Army</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After days of back-and-forth communication between envoys of both sides in the Guangxi affair, the atmosphere of peace seems to be gradually thickening. Earlier, Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, and Zhu Peide returned to Guangdong. Guangxi Province sent senior staff member Mr. Liu Weizhang to accompany Zhu, Cheng, and others to fly to Guangdong to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation with Chairman Chiang in detail. Until the 10th of this month, Mr. Liu returned to Guangxi with his mission. The Southwest Civil Aviation plane he was on was originally scheduled to take off at 8:00 a.m. on the 10th, but in the morning, a telegram from Bai Chongxi in Guangxi suddenly arrived. Mr. Liu took the telegram to Huangpu to see Chiang, so it was delayed until about 11:00 a.m. before Liu and Deng Shizeng took the Beidou Civil Aviation plane to fly west. It is said that Mr. Liu carried two important letters that day, addressed to Li and Bai respectively, and two prepared seals, one for the Guangxi Pacification Office and one for the Headquarters of the Fifth Route Army. The plane arrived in Nanning at 5:00 p.m. that day. Besides holding an important meeting the next day, it is said that regarding the reorganization of the Guangxi Army, the Guangxi authorities requested to be reorganized into ten divisions and one independent brigade, following the precedent of Guangdong Province. The authorities here have not yet responded to this point, only appointing Li Zongren as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army. The position of Deputy Commander has not been mentioned. One theory is that Cai Tingkai's troops will be incorporated into the Guangxi Army, and Mr. Cai hopes to be the Deputy Commander of the Fifth Route Army. The troops of Weng Zhaoyuan, Qu Shounian, and others are still stationed in Lianzhou, Beihai, Lianjiang, Hua County, and other places, and have not withdrawn to the Guangxi border. Martial law has not been lifted in Wuzhou, Nanning, and other places. The inspection of inbound passengers in Wuzhou has been doubled recently. Female detectives are on duty day and night, and those suspected of being arrested are heard of every day. Riverbank houses above Wuzhou were ordered to be demolished within two days on the morning of the 10th because they hindered military operations. A few days ago, about 500 to 600 members of the militia Yang Yan's unit in Teng County were disarmed by the army in Jinji because they expressed opposition to the war. Dozens of people were captured, and the leader Yang Yan was also arrested and escorted back to the Seventh Army headquarters for interrogation. On the 10th of this month, he was sentenced to be shot. A five-household joint guarantee in Wuzhou City was organized on the 10th and must be completed by the 16th. The method is to use the house number as each unit. First, each homeowner guarantees the resident, and then five homeowners jointly guarantee each other. Also, in order to prevent air raids, the Wuzhou Garrison Headquarters initiated the organization of a wartime relief association to handle air defense equipment and food storage. The authorities allocated 80,000 yuan for the above two items. In Guilin, a fire-fighting volunteer team has been formed recently and can be established on the same day. As for the militia in various places, they have been actively recruited in recent days. As the number of militia members increases, the demand for lower-level cadres and officers becomes more urgent. Yesterday, the Guangxi Army Headquarters issued a notice to recruit them and assign them to serve in various counties, and ordered all troops not to arbitrarily transfer current village chiefs and deputy cadres in order to emphasize political affairs.

<p>Japanese and Korean People Arrive in Hebei to Conduct Activities One After Another</p>
<p>Recently, the number has reached more than 100, with different activity areas, organizational purposes, and different organizations.</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Sends Personnel to Investigate the Actual Situation of the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Hebei Province has long become the gateway to North China due to the changes in circumstances. Although the provincial government has moved from Tianjin to Baoding, the implementation of provincial administration, local construction, and the activities of the people are all valued by a certain party. Our authorities, in order to promote good relations between the two countries, strictly prohibit any matters that may harm the friendship between the two countries, and provide strict protection for the actions of foreigners entering the province, fearing that a slight accident may cause disputes. Since the provincial government moved from Tianjin to Baoding last year, only the rogue vagrants who forcibly occupied Cang County and sold drugs were assisted in being cracked down on by the provincial government and the Japanese Consul in Tianjin with a sincere attitude. Since then, there has been no contact. However, the provincial government has almost no time to receive the Japanese and Korean people who enter the province to carry out any activities. According to the statistics of recent months alone, the number of Japanese and Korean people who have come to the province to conduct investigations of various natures has reached more than 100. Among them, some are of a group nature, some are individual actions, and some are free organizations of one or two people. They almost look at each other. As for the locations where these Japanese and Korean people have been, Cang County in southern Tianjin, Wanping on the Pinghan Line, Zhengding, Shijiazhuang, Jingxing, Dingxian, Anguo, and Gaoyang counties are the most numerous. Secondly, counties such as Boye, Lixian, Handan, Shahe, Cixian, Lincheng, Neiqiu, Pingshan, Lingshou, and Huolu are constantly following their traces. The matters they investigate are nothing more than the coal mines in Jingxing, Cixian, Lincheng, Wanping, and Mentougou, the weaving and dyeing industry in Gaoyang, the medicinal materials in Anguo, the factories in Cang County and Shijiazhuang, the Ping Church in Dingxian, the cotton in Zhengding, and local products such as asbestos, horticulture, agriculture, and forestry. Other aspects, such as transportation, highways, mountains, rivers, rural people's livelihood, etc., are all investigated in detail, and all hold cameras to take real scenes. Recently, Mr. Fujishingsi, a Japanese staff member of the South Manchuria Railway, went from Beiping to Changxindian to investigate the factories on the Pinghan Railway, and further investigated the rails and engineering equipment on the Pinghan Railway along the Pinghan Line to Zhengzhou. The Tokyo Imperial University horticulture professor came to Baoding a few days ago to inspect the provincial agricultural college. After the provincial government allowed them to enter the country, it immediately sent personnel to follow, take care of, and provide thoughtful hospitality. It can be said that it is meticulous, only hoping that they will leave the country safely, so even if a certain amount of money is spent, it is not regrettable. The Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital specially arranged personnel at Baoding Railway Station to take care of the entry and exit of Japanese and Korean people. The provincial government also specially hired two Japanese consultants, each with a monthly salary of 300 yuan, and there is also a Japanese counselor, Chen Qingyun, who is specially responsible for it. The preparations for receiving the Japanese can be described as extremely thorough. The provincial government also prepares food and accommodation for all Japanese and Korean people who come to the province at the Lianchi Guesthouse and officially notifies all county governments to take good care of and provide extra convenience for Japanese and Korean people entering the country to visit or investigate any matters. They are also treated preferentially in terms of food and accommodation, with the overall purpose of ensuring that they enter the country safely and leave the country safely. As for the actual content of their investigation, we cannot restrict them in any way, and they have absolute freedom. However, their ultimate goal should be understood by us, but we can only sit back and watch them do whatever they want, which is really heartbreaking. In the future, I really don't know what kind of new tricks will happen, but the underlying reasons cannot ignore their activities today.</p>
<p>The Beihai Nakano Case</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Commissioners are Investigating</p>
<p>The Fuan warship and two Japanese warships are temporarily docked in the port; our investigators advise Japanese personnel not to land hastily</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Nakano Junzo case in Beihai, the Guangxi Army stationed in Beihai, Weng Zhaoyuan, etc., tightened martial law starting from the 4th in order to protect foreigners and prevent future misunderstandings. The day after the case occurred, Weng, etc., wired Li Bai of Guangxi Province in Hepu County, saying: Received a phone call from Beihai at 6:00 p.m. on the 1st. Nakano Junzo, a Japanese man who runs the Maruichi Optical Shop in Beihai City, was beaten to death by the public on the road at around 5:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month. Respectfully reported, Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Zhaochen respectfully kowtow. The Guangxi authorities immediately replied, saying: Commander Weng Zhaoyuan of Heshan, Jian, Jiangsu, everything is known. Since the Beihai people have performed this kind of unfortunate event, I ordered the local county police to pay attention to protecting foreigners and assisting in the arrest of the murderers. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Song (5th). The highest authorities in Guangdong also telegraphed Jiang Tingkai, etc., to withdraw the troops stationed in the southern Guangdong province in order to investigate the case, and to allow the diplomatic commissioner to conduct the case negotiation without interference. However, the Beihai garrison still has the responsibility of defending the territory and has not withdrawn. On the 8th, the Japanese Acting Consul General in Guangdong, Yoshitake Sadaji, personally visited Diao Zuqian, the diplomatic commissioner of Liangguang, to exchange views on sending personnel to investigate. The Japanese deputy consul also requested that both sides first send personnel to Beihai to investigate the truth, but the Japanese investigators must be protected by our side, and the murderer in the murder case must be arrested as soon as possible. The Diplomatic Commissioner's Office immediately agreed. After the Japanese acting consul left, they sent two officials, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Guangdong, Nemoto Naganosuke, and Secretary Hirobu Hiroto, on the 9th to go to Beihai to investigate. After the two were ordered, they took a boat to Hong Kong on the evening of the 9th, transferred to the Japanese warship Sagami, and departed from Hong Kong to Beihai on the 11th. The Liangguang Diplomatic Commissioner's Office also sent Secretary Ling Shifen and three attendants, who took the Fuan warship from Guangzhou to Beihai to investigate. On the 13th, the Japanese warship Sagami and our Chinese warship Fuan arrived outside the port of Beihai one after another. For the sake of prudence, our investigating commissioner Ling Shifen first landed to conduct an investigation. The garrison strictly maintained law and order. After Ling's investigation, he returned to the Sagami warship and reported the local situation to the Japanese deputy consul, advising the Japanese warship to temporarily stop at the port and not to land lightly to avoid further incidents. The Japanese deputy consul accepted the advice and ordered the Sagami to temporarily dock outside the port of Beihai and reported the situation to the Japanese Acting Consul General stationed in Guangdong. On the same day, the Japanese warship Wakatake also arrived in Beihai, claiming to protect overseas Chinese, and temporarily docked in the port. After receiving the report, the Japanese Acting Consul General telegraphed the personnel of the two Japanese warships not to land for the time being, and Yoshitake Sadaji, the Acting Consul General, went to the Liangguang Diplomatic Commissioner's Office on the 14th to visit Diao Zuqian, requesting him to be responsible for protecting the Japanese investigators to land and investigate the Nakano case, and inquiring about the report obtained after the joint Chinese investigation. The talks lasted for 30 minutes before he left. It was also heard that the merchants in Beihai were nervous because two Japanese warships had come to protect overseas Chinese and the land defense forces had also stepped up martial law. Rumors spread that the Japanese warships Yubari and Kuma were also continuing to open up Beihai. At present, the Guangdong authorities have telegraphed to urge the Guangxi army stationed in Beihai to withdraw in order to facilitate a peaceful investigation by both sides, and after completion, it will be resolved in accordance with international law.

<p>Quanzhou Branch Customs Uncovers a Major Smuggling Organization</p>
<p>The main culprit is the current head of the land and water security corps; the organization is strict and scientific</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the customs has increased the number of anti-smuggling ships and the provincial government has set up provincial tax inspection offices along the coast to jointly crack down on smuggling, many cases have been cracked in recent months, and the wind of smuggling has been greatly reduced. In August, the Xiamen Customs collected more than 990,000 yuan in taxes, of which import taxes reached more than 930,000 yuan, which is the highest record this year. However, coastal merchants and local ruffians colluding with a certain party who are still trying to struggle to smuggle goods. The Quanzhou Branch Customs under the jurisdiction of Xiamen Customs, together with the Sixth Branch of the Provincial Tax Inspection Office stationed in Quanzhou, cracked down on a large-scale smuggling organization in Xunpu Township, more than ten miles outside Tumen, Quanzhou, on the 13th. At 9 am on the 13th, Chen Shiyong, Director of the Quanzhou Branch Customs, based on a secret report from Qianmin, said that there was a large-scale smuggling organization in Xunpu Township, and the main culprit was Huang Yansui, the head of the 210th Security Corps of Jinjiang County in the township. Huang convened the backbone members of the organization, Huang Fuqing, Huang Dachuan, and Huang Hexue, at his house on that day to discuss how to deal with the government's recent strict anti-smuggling measures. Chen reported, and immediately met with Wen Shaoping, Director of the Sixth Inspection Office, and more than 20 tax police officers, and set off on the Tongxing ship and the Customs patrol boat. They arrived in Xunpu and landed at 10 o'clock. Because Qianmin was afraid of Huang's power, he did not dare to lead the way, so he visited Huang Jiayou, the head of the local security corps, (later found out that he was not the head of the security corps) and ordered him to lead the way to Huang Yansui's house. Unexpectedly, Huang Jiayou detoured and detoured in the township for half an hour. He arrived at 11 o'clock. Yansui and other main criminals had already heard the news and fled first. Only three women and a man named Zhuang Han were found. In Huang's bedroom, letters from a certain business in Taiwan and his son's correspondence with Taiwan were found, all of which were related to smuggling, as well as private cargo account books, receipts, and cloth samples from a factory in Taipei. The letters stated that each smuggling cargo was worth thousands of yuan, and the recent three smuggling runs amounted to more than 10,000 yuan. A draft of a letter described the strictness of the government's anti-smuggling efforts and the difficulties in dealing with them, and stated that the last time they were cracked down, they suffered heavy losses, and the previous debts could not be repaid. At 8 pm that day, the three women and Zhuang Han were taken into the city and temporarily detained for interrogation. According to Chen Shiyong, the Xunpu smuggling organization has a strict organization and is jointly organized by the head of the land and water security corps. It is extremely hateful for current civil servants to secretly engage in smuggling. The main culprit, Huang Yansui, the head of the security corps, will be requested to be wanted by the government. Wen Shaoping also said that the Xunpu smuggling organization is scientific. In addition to using agile and rapid methods to smuggle goods into the country, the storage, transportation, and sales are extremely secret. Recently, there are often women who pick vegetables or grains into the city for sale, but in fact, there are mostly smuggled sugar underneath. They are currently being closely investigated. According to Quanzhou newspapers, Xunpu smugglers have suffered heavy losses due to frequent crackdowns, and they have moved their hatred to the Qianmin who reported them. There have been eight people who have been brutally killed, so Qianmin are afraid to lead the way this time. (September 16)</p>
<p>The Accident on the Yuehan Railway</p>
<p>A collision with a car in Hunan caused many casualties; the responsibility lies with the car driver's carelessness; the entire line is transported in three sections and operates in five zones</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The 22nd train from Guangzhou to the north on the Yuehan Railway, which was opened to traffic, collided with a car from the Hunan Highway Bureau from Changsha to Hengzhou at a place between Yijiawan Station and Datopu Station near Changsha at 5 am on the 13th. As a result, one locomotive and three third-class passenger cars were knocked down, killing eight passengers and seriously injuring thirteen. 300 feet of railway tracks were damaged. The highway bureau's car was also smashed to pieces, and the number of deaths and injuries is unknown. According to the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the Engineering Department was ordered to rush to repair the tracks, lift the vehicles, send the injured to nearby hospitals, and wait for relatives to identify the dead and issue condolences in accordance with railway regulations, and to severely punish the personnel who caused the accident on the road. The Xujiapeng Station of the Yuehan Railway specially issued a notice saying, "Yesterday, an traffic accident occurred between Yijiawan Station and Datopu Station due to a car breaking into the road, causing the 2nd direct train that left Guangzhou last Friday to be delayed until 6:10 am on the 15th before leaving Changsha. It is expected to arrive at this station at 7:30 pm on the 15th, and the 6th express train is also expected to arrive at this station at 1 pm." However, the train did not arrive in Wuchang until the 15th. As for the issue of responsibility for this accident, according to the person in charge of the railway bureau, because the highway and railway lines are parallel, the highway car drivers are actually bold and reckless and actually drive the car to race with the train. Because the wind is very strong when the train passes, the car drivers are accidentally careless, causing the entire car to be rolled into the water tank car behind the locomotive. The water tank car was blocked and jumped up, derailing the locomotive, and three third-class cars were turned over one after another. The responsibility for the problem rests entirely on the highway bureau's driver's carelessness, which is very obvious. If the car had temporarily stopped the horsepower at that time, then the accident would not have been caused by the train rolling it. At present, the Yuehan trains are passing normally, and the damaged vehicles are being repaired at the Xinhe Engine Factory. The aftermath issues will be handled after the return of Director Ling Hongxun and Deputy Director Zhou Zhongqi. After the opening of the Yuehan Railway, the first organizing committee meeting is scheduled to be held in Guangzhou on the 18th. Chen Yanjiong went south to Guangzhou to preside over this matter. Ling and Zhou are expected to return to Hubei at the end of September. In addition, the transportation section, the entire line has been divided into three sections, with Xujiapeng to Zhuzhou as the first section, Zhuzhou to Lechang as the second section, and Lechang to Huangsha as the third section. Each section is more than 400 miles long, and the shorter one is 260 or 70 miles. Each section is assigned one section chief and one deputy section chief. Guangzhou Erzhiqian is separately set up as a transportation branch section, which is managed by the third section. The engineering section, in addition to the Zhushao section engineering office, still manages the routes under the jurisdiction of the former Zhushao section engineering bureau, which are handled separately by the engineering office of that section. The unfinished projects will be changed to the second engineering section in the future, and the division locations of the first and third sections are the same as the transportation sections. As for the business aspect, it is planned to refer to the local economic conditions and the flow of goods to divide Hankou to Yueyang into one section, called Wuhan Zone, Matang to Lukou into one section, called Changsha Zone, Sanmen to Gaotingsi into one section, called Hengyang Zone, Loufengdu to Dakengkou into one section, called Qujiang Zone, and Shakou to Guangzhou into one section, called Guangzhou Zone. In terms of factory affairs, Xujiapeng and Guangzhou each have an engine factory, and materials are also set up in two factories in the north and south. The above-mentioned division of sections, Director Ling Hongxun has discussed and agreed with Chen Yanjiong, the director of the organizing committee, and reported it to the Railway Department for filing. In addition, the Zhuping branch line of the Yuehan Railway is scheduled to be handed over to Zhejiang-Jiangxi to take over on the 15th.</p>

<p>Xu, a Woman, Arrested for Carrying a Handgun</p>
<p>Supervisors Jiang Fu and Wang Ruchong, along with investigators Zhang Daorong, Shen Jinshu, Weng Huanzhang, and Wang Baoming from the French Concession Police Department, while patrolling near the intersection of Minxing Road at 26 Yangxing Street outside Xiaodongmen around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, found a man acting suspiciously. Upon searching him, they found a handgun and five bullets. He was taken to the police station, where he gave his name as Xu Wenbin, 28 years old, from Pudong. He also confessed to robbing Ying Zhengquan's house at 640 Beile Road on January 18th of this year, stealing two gold rings worth 24 yuan. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the police department explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation for a detailed review of the case before prosecuting. The investigators also reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest and presented the handgun and bullets as evidence. After Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed the report and questioned the defendant, he approved a postponement of the hearing to the 23rd, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Zeng Feihong Passed Away Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Feihong, an executive member of the Shanghai branch of the Lianyi Overseas Exchange Department and a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, dedicated his life to supporting the revolution and was renowned for his contributions. In the 28th year of Emperor Guangxu's reign, Zeng believed that the despotism of the imperial court and the failures of diplomacy could only be remedied by a national revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. That year, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Tokyo, Zeng joined the party and took on the responsibility of propaganda, going to Luzon, Chile, Sydney, Australia, and other places to carry out propaganda work. He was well-received by the local overseas Chinese. Later, he personally raised more than 1,800 pounds of British gold, which he remitted to the newspaper office at 8 Chinatown, London (the London branch of the Tongmenghui) for revolutionary needs. After the revolution's success, he returned to China and was appointed as the captain of the Northern Expeditionary Army's detachment by Mr. Huang Xing. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he was again dispatched by Dr. Sun Yat-sen to American and Chinese postal ships to raise funds and conduct propaganda, as well as secretly transport military equipment back to China for future use. In the 8th year of the Republic, he was appointed as the chief of investigation and procurement by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's military government. In the 9th year, when Chen Jiongming rebelled, he was again sent to Chinese and Nanjing postal ships to perform the same duties, raising millions of dollars and transporting countless military equipment. After the reorganization of the party in the 13th year of the Republic, he was recommended by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as the captain of the Pingnan warship in the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau. In the 16th year, he served as a member of the reorganization committee of the Seamen's General Union. In the 18th year, he returned to Hong Kong to conduct propaganda and liaison work with various organizations. In January of the 21st year of the Republic, he came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and was appointed as the deputy chief of police of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway by Wang, who was also the Minister of Railways. In the winter of the 22nd year, he was transferred to the position of commissioner by Minister Gu. He resigned from his position in the Railway Department in December of last year due to illness from overwork and devoted himself to managing Lianyi and various social organizations. Unexpectedly, due to excessive overwork, he passed away from a heart attack at 10:00 AM on the 16th, at the age of 59.

<p>New Traffic Regulations for the Public Concession Will Be Implemented in Mid-October</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Re-Discusses</p>
<p>The Police Chief Prepares a Written Opinion</p>
<p>Regarding the amendment of traffic regulations by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the addition of restrictions on automobile parking, the Board of Directors, in a show of fairness due to strong opposition from the automotive industry, had previously decided to temporarily postpone the implementation date of September 5th to allow for further consideration after the end of the Board's recess. Recently, relevant departments of the Public Works Department have carefully considered the arguments from all sides. The Board of Directors also re-discussed this issue at a routine meeting held the day before yesterday. As a result, it was decided that the new traffic regulations should be implemented on the 15th of this year. The Police Chief also attended the Board meeting the day before yesterday and prepared various diagrams and detailed reports in advance for the directors' review. The report explained the arguments in the presentation submitted to the Public Works Department by the Chinese Automobile Association and the criticisms published in various Western newspapers. He stated that critics apparently lacked a clear understanding of the regulations and were confined to personal convenience and interests, unwilling to consider the interests of others. Therefore, he felt that the doubts of various sectors regarding the new traffic regulations could still be explained, while opposition motivated solely by personal gain could be justifiably dismissed. According to the Police Chief, the proposed new regulations have been carefully considered and are extremely simple and easy to understand. These new regulations are consistent with the principles followed in other parts of the world. The unrestricted parking of automobiles on public roads is tantamount to treating the roads as garages. Therefore, prohibiting it except in designated areas is a universally accepted principle. Similarly, temporary stops for picking up or dropping off passengers should also be subject to certain restrictions, except in designated areas. Since these principles are already implemented elsewhere, there is no reason why they should not be implemented in the Shanghai Public Concession. As for areas with particularly congested traffic in the city center, special provisions should be made, but these should not conflict with the general regulations. Therefore, Article 28 of the new regulations stipulates that parking is prohibited on certain roads, while Article 48 stipulates that temporary stops of up to one hour are permitted on certain roads at certain times, except in certain areas. These provisions can be modified at any time as circumstances change without affecting the overall framework of the new regulations. These clauses are worded very clearly, but some still criticize them as difficult to understand. This is simply due to personal interests. According to the Police Chief, the unrestricted parking of automobiles on public roads is a past mistake, and the implementation of the new regulations is intended to correct this mistake. After the new regulations are implemented, there may be some inconvenience for a small number of car owners, but for the sake of public interest, there is no reason to abandon the effort for fear of choking.</p>
<p>Chinese Yangtze River Pilots' Delegation Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Hopes for Transfer to Ministry of Communications Management</p>
<p>Will Be Decided by Inter-Ministerial Consultation</p>
<p>Feng Fucheng and others, representatives of the Chinese Yangtze River pilots, who petitioned in Beijing to reclaim piloting rights, transfer management to the Ministry of Communications, and stop the Pilot Committee from changing licenses, have returned to Shanghai. The outcome of this trip was very positive. According to reports, regarding the cancellation of the Pilot Committee's partial authority, the Central Department of Civil Training has prepared a plan, which has been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review by various ministries. A meeting will be convened soon to discuss it. As for the cessation of license changes, the Pilot Committee has reportedly stopped the inspections and exempted the issuance of new licenses. Instead, pilots are only required to bring their old licenses to be stamped to indicate that they have been updated. However, although the committee has stopped inspections and exempted new licenses, it still charges fees when pilots bring their old licenses to be stamped, which is close to exploitation (as a fee of fifteen yuan is required for each stamp). Therefore, all the pilots have to request the government to expressly waive the fees to avoid unnecessary costs. It is understood that various ministries also consider the committee's fees to be unreasonable and have adopted the pilots' request, with the Ministry of Finance forwarding the issue to the committee for reply and temporarily suspending the fees.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society</p>
<p>Second Annual Account Report</p>
<p>Certified by Lixin Accounting Firm</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Concession Accepted and Filed</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, the first annual income and expenditure accounts, ending on July 31 of this year, have been submitted to the Board of Directors for approval by the society's financial management committee, consisting of Messi, Xu Jiting, and Ci Ganchen. The accounts have been certified as accurate and correct by accountant Pan Xulun and, in accordance with the society's regulations, a copy of the accounts has been submitted to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession for filing. The full text of the management committee's report and accounts is published below.</p>
<p>Upon review, since the establishment of the Mutual Aid Society, all matters have been new and innovative. Therefore, it was not until the end of the first year that a basic structure was seen. The expenses in the first year cannot be compared with those of the second year. However, in general terms, the income was over 19,152.50 yuan, which is not much different from the first year. Special donations increased from 400 yuan in the previous year to 2,171 yuan this year. These donations are all voluntary donations from rickshaw owners who admitted to violating license regulations and paid fines in lieu of suspension of their licenses. Voluntary donations decreased from 64.50 yuan last year to 58 yuan this year. Bank interest increased from 2,663.48 yuan last year to 4,716.67 yuan this year. The income from the dormitory cooperation fund increased from just over 470 yuan at the beginning of last year to 1,499.31 yuan this year. On the expenditure side, the total expense excluding rickshaw pullers' license fees increased from only 35,141 yuan last year to 140,111 yuan this year. However, the payment of rickshaw pullers' license fees decreased from over 37,000 yuan last year to 16,450 yuan. Major expenditure items included medical expenses of over 44,800 yuan, mutual aid expenses of over 13,600 yuan, and education expenses of over 12,400 yuan. The mutual aid expenses were only for four days, as the rickshaw pullers' life insurance plan was established in May, and there was no need for the society to allocate additional relief funds. Furthermore, the profit on the income statement for this year was over 14,839.55 yuan. Adding the profit of over 101,000 yuan from the previous year, the total profit was over 116,900 yuan. After deducting 29,000 yuan for the insurance fund and 10,000 yuan for the rickshaw pullers' pension, there was still a profit of 86,910.54 yuan. The management committee is extremely satisfied with this situation, as this amount can be retained as a reserve for future work, and the regular income can be fully used for the welfare of rickshaw pullers. The above accounts were prepared by Tang Sheng Accountant and audited by Pan Xulun, Chief Accountant of Lixin Accounting Firm, and passed at the Board meeting on September 8. The certification from Lixin Accounting Firm is transcribed below: "We have reviewed the accounts of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, managed by the society's accountant, for the period from August 1, 1935, to July 31, 1936. All revenue items during the above period have been verified and reconciled with bank statements. All payment vouchers have also been audited and found to be correct. This is to certify that all items listed in the attached tables are accurate. Certified by Pan Xulun, Chief Accountant of Lixin Accounting Firm, Shanghai, September 4, 1936." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Suspicious Loan of 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>An Elderly Woman Accuses Fraud</p>
<p>After Checking the Stamps and Authenticating the Handwriting</p>
<p>The Loan Document Appears to Be Forged</p>
<p>Gu Pingzhen, also known as Gu Baoru, who resides at No. 1 Yuqing Lane, Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi, and runs the Congbaoli Pattern Factory, recently sued Yin Weng, an elderly woman residing at Xicangqiao, Chengnan, in the Shanghai District Court, claiming that her late grandmother, Gu Gong, had loaned her 20,000 yuan on December 10, 1930, plus 10,000 yuan in interest, totaling 30,000 yuan. The intermediary was the woman's second son-in-law, Cheng Jizhi (who lives on Danfeng Road inside Xiaodongmen and is the son of the late Pearl Industry Director Cheng Xinbo, and a partner in Zhang Ruxin's Xingxing Pearl Company, which has a sole proprietorship capital of 200,000 yuan). The guarantor on the loan document was the woman's eldest son-in-law, He Shuhe (who lives at No. 11 Lichuan Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, and is the former manager of the bankrupt He Hengchang Silk Shop inside Xiaodongmen). After being summoned by the court, the woman stated that she had never met the Gu family before and had no dealings with them. Moreover, she owns many properties in Zhengjia Muqiao and other places, with substantial rental income each month. She has assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan. Why would she borrow 20,000 yuan from someone she did not know in 1930? As for her two sons-in-law, Cheng Jizhi and He Shuhe, she used to give them each 50 yuan per month. Recently, due to rent arrears from tenants and the lack of tenants for her properties, she stopped paying them. Therefore, they colluded to forge the loan document to defraud her of money. Furthermore, she has two sons who are adults and have been handling matters for her for the past nineteen years. She has never personally handled matters herself, which is further proof. She requested the termination of the civil lawsuit and filed a criminal lawsuit against Gu Pingzhen, He Shuhe, Cheng Jizhi, and others for forgery and fraud. Judge Wu Xiangzu held a court hearing and summoned Gu Wenhua, Gu Pingzhen's sister, to testify. Gu Wenhua testified that her mother, Gu Gong, passed away on April 10, 1933, and that she was present when her mother made her will, only instructing them to be careful in their dealings. Her mother had never mentioned giving Gu Pingzhen a loan document worth 10,000 yuan. Moreover, her mother had always lived with her and did not bring a single box when she was taken to Gu Pingzhen's house when she became seriously ill. The loan document was inexplicable. After hearing the testimony, the judge detained all the defendants. Later, Cheng Jizhi was released on bail by Zhang Ruxin of the Samsung Pearl Company because he was only the intermediary on the loan document and had less responsibility. The judge ordered the loan document to be authenticated by calligrapher Wang Xishen. Judge Wu also discovered that the stamp on the loan document was a recent, new type. Therefore, he personally went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate the account books from 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933. The stamp on the account books did not match the stamp on the loan document. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. Lawyers Fang Junjie, Gu Yiyi, and Peng Yi attended on behalf of the plaintiff, while lawyers Peng and Ma Shouhua attended on behalf of the defendant. The judge first had them examine the stamps on the account books from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce one by one. Then, Wang Xishen reported that the handwriting on the loan document was similar to that of He Shuhe. At this point, the judge questioned the three defendants, who still claimed that they had not committed forgery. The judge then ordered the beginning of arguments and announced the end of arguments. The verdict will be announced on the 23rd. Cheng was released on his original bail, and the others were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Domestic Halibut Liver Oil Essence</p>
<p>Manufactured by Zhongshan Port Lirenyao Hall</p>
<p>Sold by Sincere Company in This City</p>
<p>Halibut liver oil essence is rich in both Vitamin A and Vitamin D and is an excellent natural supplement. It is particularly effective in treating tuberculosis, insomnia, heart weakness, stomach weakness, and smoking cessation. It is also very beneficial for infant development and postpartum care for women. The daily dose is extremely small, but the effect is significant. Three drops are equivalent to one teaspoon of ordinary cod liver oil and are eighty times more potent than ordinary cod liver oil. Previously, this type of halibut liver oil essence was imported, and the amount of money leaked overseas each year was difficult to calculate. Zhuo Shuhe, the owner of the Zhongshan Port Lirenyao Hall in Guangdong Province, traveled to the East and West Sand Islands in his youth and discovered that there were many halibut produced there. After years of research, he extracted the purest oil essence from the livers of halibut using the latest scientific methods. The quality and efficacy are no different from imported products. He has now named his product "Loyalty and Forgiveness" brand halibut liver oil essence and launched it on the market. It is sold by the Western Medicine Department of Sincere Company on Nanjing Road in this city. The price is about two to three times cheaper than imported products.</p>

<p>To Eradicate the Root Cause of Gonorrhea Bacteria</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Zongkun, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Only By Increasing the Phagocytic Power of White Blood Cells</p>
<p>Eliminating Orchitis in Men and Oophoritis in Women is the Most Appropriate Treatment</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea must start with eradicating its root cause. Therefore, the sooner one seeks medical attention, the faster and more complete the recovery will be. If the acute phase is delayed, and the gonococci spread into the blood, treatment becomes difficult. Even if it becomes chronic and local membrane-penetrating sterilization therapy is still used, the root cause cannot be eliminated. Although a temporary cure may be achieved, recurrence is inevitable.</p>
<p>In Japan, when I was studying medicine at the Imperial University, I had already heard of famous Western scholars such as Dr. Weichardt and Professor August Bier and his student Professor Zimmer advocating for therapies to increase the number of white blood cells (Lencocytoseitlerapie). This therapy uses the secondary decomposition products of proteins to promote the phagocytic action of white blood cells and increase their number. As a result, the gonococci in the blood are killed by the attack of white blood cells. White blood cells can also seep out of the blood vessel walls and enter the tissues. Therefore, gonococci in all parts of the body can be eliminated. Once the root cause is removed, gonorrhea naturally heals. However, at that time, this theory had not yet been put into practice.</p>
<p>After I returned to China, protein was combined with pure pigments by Dr. Biedel of Germany to create the drug "Kelinong." Because this drug increases the number of white blood cells, its effectiveness in fighting systemic bacterial toxins is particularly strong, without causing adverse stimulation or stomach upset. I have used it on many male and female patients with gonorrhea, and the results have been very rapid. However, in addition to taking "Kelinong," women with gonorrhea-induced leukorrhea must also use "Ka'erxuedi" as a suppository externally. According to my and Dr. Vipchow's experience, chronic male patients with prostatic urethritis, orchitis, bladder gonorrhea, and arthritis can be cured completely with about six to ten bottles. The sooner one starts taking it, the faster the recovery!</p>
<p>How to Eliminate Evil Thoughts</p>
<p>Seminal Emission is More Serious Than Bleeding</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Some People Ejaculate at the Sight of Beauty</p>
<p>Some People Seek Pleasure in Dreams!</p>
<p>Semen is dozens of times more valuable than blood for a person's health. Yet, people regret losing a little blood but lightly dismiss daily seminal emissions. The most common cause of seminal emission in young people is masturbation. Masturbation loosens the seminal vesicle and weakens the sexual nerves. The function of the gonads is also damaged by this abominable habit.</p>
<p>To remedy seminal emission, one must first resolve to quit this bad habit. However, internal medicine is still necessary. According to the years of experience of Tolstoy and Pic, seminal emission caused by masturbation can only be cured with "Nairis Seminal Emission Pills." These pills not only strengthen the seminal vesicle but also calm the nerves, reducing evil thoughts in young people, making it easier to quit masturbation. This is an effect that no other seminal emission pills have. However, if one has suffered from seminal emission for a long time, and the sexual nerves and body are extremely weak, "Butikang" can be taken at the same time for a synergistic effect.</p>
<p>Treatment for Insomnia and Impotence</p>
<p>Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>In the spring, a Mr. Nie Huanian came to the clinic complaining of insomnia, neurasthenia, tinnitus, dizziness, memory loss, back pain, premature ejaculation, and impotence. I diagnosed that his nerves had been severely depleted. After questioning, I learned that this was caused by early marriage, which damaged his sexual function, resulting in hypersensitivity of the peripheral nerves. The marriage was in name only, offspring were difficult, and family conflicts were frequent, almost leading to a divorce. Mr. Nie's illness initially presented as premature ejaculation. He took various tonics, which damaged his reproductive glands, resulting in impotence. Fortunately, he was introduced to me by his friend, Mr. Zhu Fanyao. I prescribed a large dose of "Butikang" to increase hormone production and correct the function of his reproductive glands. After about two bottles, his sexual function improved greatly. After another four weeks of treatment, all his neurasthenia symptoms were completely relieved. Life was full of vigor, and the relationship was harmonious!</p>
<p>Creating a Happy Family</p>
<p>Family Harmony is Built on the Love of Husband and Wife</p>
<p>But Love is Built on the Sexual Desire of Men and Women</p>
<p>Since the ancient Eve ate the fruit of wisdom, love has arisen between men and women, and all the rights and wrongs between the sexes have arisen from this. We often see harmonious families with very strong love between husband and wife. But why are so many families constantly arguing and becoming enemies? To be honest, their harmony and love are entirely due to the disharmony of sex between husband and wife. This can be proven by the facts in our medical field.</p>
<p>Many young men or youths who are developing have their sexual function prematurely damaged and prevented from developing due to bad external temptations, destroying the sexual system and causing incomplete development. Those who are short and childlike are those who have already developed. If they damage their reproductive function due to masturbation and excessive sexual activity, such as seminal emission, premature ejaculation, frequent erotic dreams, and incomplete erection, they will follow one after another.</p>
<p>I ask, can a husband with such hidden illnesses get his wife's love? Of course not. Therefore, men with these diseases are always in a state of worry. Happy families are destroyed by these diseases. So, to solve the problem, to restore a harmonious family and the love of husband and wife, all the diseases must be cured. For such treatments, hormone therapy is popular in modern times. Simmond and Payr have published amazing papers at international research institutes. Later, German Mellen studied hard based on the theories of various families and, after 30 years of hard work, finally invented the drug "Butikang." It is extracted from the hormones of strong animals, and after taking it, it can make sexual organs develop normally. It can cure sexual neurasthenia, such as premature ejaculation, seminal emission, and incomplete erection. Therefore, the drug "Butikang" can be found in major cities in various countries. It is truly an essential element for increasing the love of husband and wife and rebuilding a happy family.</p>

<p>Why Did Qingwen in "Dream of the Red Chamber" Have to be Cremated After Death? Jia Baoyu Couldn't Answer. How Long Can the Tuberculosis Bacteria Live? Is There a Way to Kill It?</p>
<p>The pathogen of tuberculosis, the tuberculosis bacteria, has a very strong vitality. Even if the patient develops a fever of more than 40 degrees Celsius in the human body, it cannot kill it. Even if it is placed in boiling water at 100 degrees Celsius, it must be boiled for half an hour to end its life. Chinese people originally did not know what tuberculosis bacteria was, but they generally knew that there were tuberculosis worms. Therefore, the things used by tuberculosis patients must be burned completely after the person dies. Sometimes they also cremate the corpses of tuberculosis patients. It is said that if they do not do this, tuberculosis moths will fly out and enter other people's lungs, thus causing the disease. Chinese doctors call this transmission "ghost qi."</p>
<p>Qingwen, Baoyu's maid in "Dream of the Red Chamber," died of "daughter's tuberculosis," and his sister-in-law cremated her for this reason. I remember that Baoyu also wrote a eulogy.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis bacteria are simply not easy to kill except by burning. If there are tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs, it is best to take the latest calcium-replicating "Bufei Naer" to increase the amount of lime around the affected area, and then take "Butikang" for men and "Bunuyong" for women to strengthen the body. On the one hand, the tuberculosis bacteria are trapped in the lime, and on the other hand, the tuberculosis bacteria are eliminated by strengthening the body. It is very easy to cure lung disease this way. Taking these medicines for about ten weeks can cure the disease completely. "Bunuyong" can treat women's tuberculosis, amenorrhea, neurasthenia, and insomnia. If there is leukorrhea, "Ka'erxuedi" can be used externally as a suppository. "Butikang" can treat men's tuberculosis, kidney atrophy, seminal thinning, loss of sleep. If there is seminal emission, "Nairis Seminal Emission Pills" can be taken at the same time. As for "Bufei Naer," it can treat lung tuberculosis, cough, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, and weight loss. After taking it, it can make people energetic and strong, so lung tuberculosis can be cured forever.</p>
<p>Appropriate Treatment of New and Old Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>There is No Other Secret to Curing Leukorrhea,</p>
<p>Directly Attack the Bacteria Nest to Eradicate the Root Cause.</p>
<p>Only "Kelinong" in the World Can Do This!</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, whether new or old, can only be completely eradicated. However, in acute gonorrhea, the toxin is concentrated in the front of the urethra, so it is easy to capture and kill, and the risk of complications can be avoided. But once it becomes chronic, the only way is to thoroughly treat it by taking "Kelinong" internally, so that the medicinal power reaches the lesion and shrinks until it is completely cured.</p>
<p>When I was studying at the Medical School of the Russian Labor University in Moscow, I knew for a long time that this drug was effective quickly and accurately. Specialist professors in the school and famous local hospitals all recommended it. Therefore, the drug "Kelinong" was highly praised by the Russian people. Since the Russian Revolution, there have been many liberations on the issue of sex, so venereal diseases are very prevalent, and this drug is actually a special drug for gonorrhea. This is what I personally experienced during my internship in Russia. Since returning to China after graduation, whenever I encounter gonorrhea, I order "Kelinong" to be taken, and the effect is immediately apparent. However, I also used other miscellaneous brands of gonorrhea drugs later, and I did not expect that the side effects were often very large, destroying healthy tissues, expanding the lesions, and increasing the difficulty of treatment. I began to realize that I had been deceived. Therefore, those who purchase and take "Kelinong" in the future must identify the name of the drug and never mistakenly take other inferior drugs. As for those whose wives are also infected with gonorrhea-induced leukorrhea, in addition to taking "Kelinong" internally, the vagina can be used with "Ka'erxuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Then the effect will be even faster.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea That Has Become a Bad Disease</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is the easiest disease to cure in the world, but it is often due to improper treatment or taking the wrong medicine, so mild cases turn into severe cases, and severe cases turn into dangerous cases, especially those who suffer from gonorrhea. In the acute stage of gonorrhea, although the surface symptoms are very dangerous, if proper treatment is given at this time, it is not difficult to cure it completely. However, experience tells us that many cases of gonorrhea become bad diseases due to taking the wrong inferior medicine and unskilled surgery, which leads to toxins entering the body and causing various complications. Gonococcus is a bacterium that is good at running away. If you take the wrong inferior medicine, the gonococcus will follow the inferior medicine and destroy tissues, adding fuel to the fire, making the disease worse. This is the reason why gonorrhea becomes a bad disease.</p>
<p>The so-called bad diseases, such as arthritis, orchitis, urethral stricture, etc., can all be regarded as one of the bad diseases of gonorrhea. Minor cases will regret it for the rest of their lives, and severe cases will</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance November Issue Debuts, Bidding Closes with Gradually Increasing Buying Interest, Resulting in a Rise of Two Yuan Three Jiao Compared to Previous Closing, Approximately Half a Yuan Decrease Even with Swaps.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw the debut of the November issue. The market had difficulty rallying because pure gold was still falling. Later, it rebounded as buying interest gradually increased. Even with swaps, the result was still a decrease of about half a yuan. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed no change in both London and New York. Floor traders said that there were a few large sellers after the market closed, but the U.S. Treasury Department was said to have absorbed them. Forward silver prices in Montreux remained unchanged across the board, and exchange rates remained long. London spot gold decreased by one penny. The Central Bank's rates for both the British pound and the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. The Customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard bid gold price was listed, reduced to 1116 yuan and eight jiao. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened at 22 yuan and a half to three yuan, then rose again to above three yuan, with limited transactions. The morning opening was slightly higher, but after calculating with swaps, it actually fell by about one yuan. After the opening, there were many sellers taking advantage of the high price, and it continued to fall back. Large investors maintained their positions at the low, and it was then pulled up. HSBC's listed rates were announced, with no change in both the British pound and the U.S. dollar, and no change in the silver equalization tax. There were not many changes mid-way, and the trend was gradually rising, but it mostly hovered. After entering the market, buying interest increased and prices rose due to a lack of supply.

Yesterday, the difference between the spot and November issue was posted by the longs at two yuan, eight mao and four jiao. The half-day market situation will be recorded below.

After the opening, banks conducted reciprocal transactions, but the situation remained slightly tight. HSBC's listed rates, both the pound and the dollar remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. The overall trend hovered, and later sellers were on the sidelines. Therefore, although banks engaged in many reciprocal transactions, the near-term remained tight, mainly due to swap closeouts. The noon closing near-term selling prices were one shilling two pence three one two five and two five against each other for the pound, and twenty yuan one two five for the dollar, with the pound tightening by 0.046875 and the dollar tightening by 0.09375 compared to the previous closing.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Business Securities Exchange, the market returned to stability. As the rumors of the previous day were not true, market prices became stable and stagnant. Currently, without significant changes or very clear performance, market prices are difficult to move. Although delivery is near, there is unlikely to be much squeeze. Yesterday, the Type Wu opened with a rise of one jiao and a half, and the market situation was immediately stable. Subsequently, most of the listed varieties improved by five fen. After this, the market situation became stagnant and hovering, with no ups and downs. Transactions were also light. Only swap transactions slightly adorned the trading floor. The dull situation seemed impossible to break. People's hearts were scattered, so the resulting market prices were still mixed, hovering between five fen and one jiao. The total transaction volume was 3,825,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan). Yarn and Cotton: Longs and Shorts Stalemate, Yarn Market Feels Stagnant.</p>
<p>However, there were reports that several thousand bales of arbitrage yarn were delivered this month. The yarn market was flat, and the situation was stagnant. The overseas yarn and cotton situation was calm, and spot yarn sales turned bleak. Moreover, a certain merchant sold whenever the price rose, creating significant pressure. Although there was a shortage of new yarn chips for delivery this month, there were also reports that several thousand bales of arbitrage yarn were delivered.</p>
<p>The post-market for bid yarn is exceptionally loose.</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for bid yarn was mediocre due to the foreign cotton situation. The trend was very weak, and the reduction in stored yarn tended to favor the longs. Therefore, the struggle between the longs and shorts was fierce, and the hovering force was even greater. The situation in the second and third sessions was quite poor, with chaotic price calls, entering the 200 yuan level. Subsequently, the shorts worked hard to push forward, and Chang · · Xincheng · Dachang · batches were dragged in, and the market price rebounded. The closing rose by seven or eight jiao. However, Huamao · Shenji · Yongda · Xinhua and others threw out a lot. As a result, the near-month closing price fell by two jiao compared to the previous day, and the far-month rose by one or two jiao. The market atmosphere was exceptionally loose after the afternoon opening, a phenomenon rarely seen recently. Transactions were very rare, with only two or three jiao traded in each month. As a result, each month fell slightly by one, two, or four jiao compared to the morning closing price. Checking the sales, Huamao sold 3,250 bales, Minghua 650 bales, Yukang 700 bales, Changyu 1,000 bales, Shenji 1,850 bales, Yongda 1,150 bales, and Xinhua 1,500 bales. Buying included Mingde 2,600 bales, Gengfeng 2,600 bales, Changfeng 5,650 bales, Dachang 1,390 bales, Xincheng 1,300 bales, and Fukang 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Bleak.</p>
<p>Checking the statistics, all gangs bought a total of 690 bales throughout the day. The selling price was similar to the previous day. The buying amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 300 Guangdong: 320 Wuhu: 10</p>
<p>Shantou: 40 Nanjing: 10 Hankou: 10</p>
<p>Yuda Hedging Sales, Near-Month Cotton Drops Sharply by Four Jiao and a Half.</p>
<p>The cotton market trended weak due to the sluggish American and Indian cotton markets, and the weather cleared up. Cotton was about to be picked, benefiting greatly. Moreover, the former longs had already heavily turned short, using coarse cotton to pressure the October issue. Therefore, the distance between near-term and long-term prices widened. However, shipments from various production areas were not strong, and factories were eagerly snatching new cotton. The spot cotton market situation was quite high.</p>
<p>The distance between near-term and long-term prices widened.</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for bid cotton was mediocre due to the American cotton market lacking momentum, continuing to fall by three to six points. Indian cotton fell by one and a half rupees, and Osaka first-grade cotton fell by five fen to one jiao. In addition, the weather was clear and people's hearts turned frustrated. The near-term fell by three or four jiao, and the far-term fell by one jiao. The second session was still flat and weak. In the third session, the yarn market rebounded. Gengfeng, Chengji, Hengyi, Dachang, and Changhe still purchased, but Ningbo gangs Yuanxingchang, Yuda, Yukang, Zhenda, Renfeng, Hexing, etc., sold. As a result, the near-month closing price fell by one and a half to three jiao compared to the previous day, and the far-term rose by five fen. The market state after the afternoon opening was ordinary, and transactions were very light. Both long and short parties stood still. However, Changhe still purchased, but Yuda hedged sales heavily this month. As a result, October fell by two jiao, and the far-term was flat. Checking the sales, Dafu sold 1,300 dan, Juxing 1,200 dan, Yukang 1,900 dan, Yuda 6,100 dan, Zhenda 1,900 dan, Hexing 2,100 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Runkang 2,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,600 dan, and Yongchang 1,400 dan. Buying included Changhe 6,300 dan, Yicheng 1,300 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, Jinghua 2,700 dan, Gengfeng 9,600 dan, Dachang 1,500 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Dafeng 1,600 dan, Chengji 2,100 dan, and Jifeng 1,500 dan.

<p>American cotton opened, and Liverpool news was good. Peers and foreign companies bought in, and each month rose by two to five points. It was sold by local gangs, and there was a reaction. Although the western cotton area received rain, it did not benefit the cotton harvest. Spot prices were firm and high, and demand was weak. At the same time, large-scale purchases were overturned by the surge in collection fees. The cloth market was firm and lively, and the closing was flat and weak. Spot cotton fell by five points, and futures fell by three to six points. English spot cotton fell by seven points, and futures fell by three to four points. Indian cotton European exporters sold sporadically, absorbed by the previous day's sellers. Pingle fell by 1.5 rupees, Omla fell by 0.75 rupees, and Bairo fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 15th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation remained generally stable. White goods and Dongpi's morning market heard that bid yarn and cotton had fallen, and each brand of fine cloth and fine twill fell by two and a half to five fen per piece. By the noon market, the yarn and cotton closing prices had recovered, and market prices also rebounded by two and a half fen. The fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth market prices of this factory and the British company Jardine Matheson remained stable. The blue double-chicken fine cloth produced by Yuhua Factory in Hankou rose by one jiao per piece in Shanghai because the sales in Hankou had increased. This factory's fine cloth was scarce, and the supply greatly declined. In recent days, Anhui gangs and Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong gangs have all handled about 200 pieces. Coarse cloth was most needed by this street and inland gangs. Yesterday, more than 200 pieces were traded. The arrival of 18-pound Derby coarse cloth from Hankou was not smooth, and it was sold out as soon as it arrived. Seasonal flannelette and finished printed and dyed cloths were slightly less needed by the Yangtze River gangs, but inland gangs and Guangdong, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong still had a large appetite. During the price reduction period in this street and inland, the sales of various goods were lively. Light blue standard color cloth was most suitable for women's cheongsams and was very popular for a time. Grain: Factories Hedge Very Little, Flour Seems to Carry a Firm and Stable Color.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented an image of initial stability followed by continued stability in the morning opening across all months. Chicago wheat prices fluctuated by a few jiao in both directions, while Canadian wheat prices were better by about three or four jiao. At the time of the opening price, the market atmosphere was very quiet due to cautious buying and selling, roughly the same as the previous day. After the second session, the current month slightly supplemented due to floating shorts, and the factories did not move at all, so the opening price immediately increased by about one fen. Until the afternoon opening, the wheat market was flat, actual sales lacked significant activity, and people's hearts were slightly tired. However, since the factories hedged very little and outside buyers continued to absorb, the quoted price seemed unable to loosen too much. However, in terms of actual sales, there was little hope for excessive fluctuations in the future. Many Floating Shorts Emerge, Futures Wheat Falls Back in the Afternoon - Spot Goods Also See Stability</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally flat and tired in the morning opening across all months. Although Canadian wheat prices were better by three or four jiao, the tone of the telegrams suggested that there might be a downward trend in the future, so people's hearts were lonely. Both buyers and sellers had no developments. The current month was better by one fen, and the far term was slightly smaller by one to three fen. Until the afternoon opening, the current month immediately fell back by a small two or three fen due to the release of floating shorts. Transactions in the far term were very rare and also carried a small one or two fen. If flour sales do not improve in the future, the wheat market will have nothing to offer. The current wheat market remains stable, with Shandong Wuhe Yingzhou wheat opening at five yuan and five fen, Hefei at four yuan and nine jiao, Bengbu wheat at five yuan, and the second grade at four yuan and nine jiao and a half, Shahe wheat at five yuan and five fen, and the second grade at five yuan, Yanghe wheat at four yuan and nine jiao and nine fen, Mingguang wheat at five yuan and five fen, Yaowan wheat at four yuan and nine jiao and a half, Suqian wheat at four yuan and eight jiao and a half, Hushu wheat at four yuan and eight jiao and two fen, and Wuhu wheat at four yuan and six jiao and a half, handled by Fuxin for 5,000 bags, and Shenda for 3,000 bags.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total source from various gangs arrived at the 14th and 15th, with more than 3,000 shi of goods in total. The sales market on this street was still sluggish. Dalian handled nearly 300 bags of specially thin rice, so the market situation was still soft. The asking price for thick early rice was fixed. However, thin rice was short of high-quality materials, and the market showed a slight increase. Dong Xin Geng had no significant changes, only special goods rose slightly. Xin Lu Yangjian was still soft. Yinbian Yuan was similar to the previous.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of incoming goods from various gangs in Hexia was 31 and 32. The sales of various varieties on the market were slow for white broken indica.

<p>Blue lead transactions have been very sluggish recently because the customer gangs have stopped operating. Because of not prosperous.

For example, foreign lead is sold at 25 yuan per dan, and local lead is also sold at 23 yuan, both of which are more than 2 yuan higher than before. However, checking the current market base, there is very little stock, the popularity is consolidated, and the market situation is unlikely to loosen easily in a short time. Silk and Tea: Sichuan Yellow and White Silk Gradually Becomes Active.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai silk market did not make progress in foreign locked silk due to the sluggish foreign silk prices. Only domestic white silk prices were slightly soft and transactions were not enthusiastic. However, Sichuan's Yellow and White silk has seemed to gradually become active recently, and foreign companies and users have been inquiring frequently. The line market has also risen slightly compared to before. Yesterday, the city traded 305 packages, with domestic and foreign silk sales each accounting for half. Needle Eyebrow Pearl Tea Has Some Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign company tea market was still sparse. Although the British company Xie He Yanghang continued to search for and prepare for Qidou black tea, no transactions were made due to market price relations. The green tea market was also very flat. The sales of Zhenmei did not see significant progress. Only items such as needle eyebrow pearl tea had some sales, and the market was trending consistently downward.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Warehouse Industry Union report, green tea has still not had much activity in recent days. Various foreign companies are blending to prepare for loading onto ships. Although foreign countries have sent telegrams offering prices for the stored teas, no transactions have been made due to the low prices, resulting in extremely sparse transactions. Yesterday, Xiehe entered a little over a hundred boxes of small needle eyebrows, priced at 23 yuan. Huacha continued to enter dozens of boxes of Chouzhen, and Baitouhang had a few transactions of Gongxi Yuantou, etc. It is observed that the selling prices were slightly lower than before.

However, tea merchants see this situation, and people's hearts are empty, and many are willing to lower prices and seek sales. Therefore, the general phenomenon this month is that transactions are not lonely under the lure of frequent price declines.</p>

<p>The Dreaded Syphilis Spirochete (Zhen Sheng)</p>
<p>Syphilis is a disease that weakens nations and destroys races, its harm no less than opium. Syphilis in our country actually began in the late reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming (Hongzhi), around the year 1500 in the Western calendar. Portuguese sailors traveled to Goa, India, and from Goa arrived in Guangdong, bringing this disease with them, which was then called “Guangdong Sore.” Afterward, it gradually spread, poisoning the entire nation. Now, there is nowhere without traces of syphilis. As for its cause, previous scholars have debated it in many ways. It was not until 1889 (15th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of Qing Dynasty) that Xiyaoding and Hofman discovered the pathogen, calling it the “syphilis spirochete.” It is small and weak, measuring 4-14 microns in length and about 0.25 microns in width, with regular and sharp curves, very much like a spiral. The number of curves varies, generally more than twenty, but at least four or five. Both ends are pointed, each with a thin flagellum, and its movement is very active, either rotating, moving back and forth, or bending, resembling a snake. Its reproductive ability is extremely strong, and its vitality is also strong. Gonococci, in test tubes at room temperature or in incubators, survive for only one week, while syphilis spirochetes in test tubes, at 37 degrees Celsius, the same as human body temperature, can survive for two, three, or even five years. The syphilis spirochete thrives in moist environments, so the human mouth, anus, vulva, and penis are its most suitable places to live. Once this bacterium invades the human body, it causes symptoms that, if left untreated, directly endanger the individual's life, infect wives and concubines, and are inherited by children, indirectly affecting society and the nation, weakening the race. The intensity of its harm cannot be overstated, all thanks to it. Everyone knows how dreadful syphilis is, so it should be treated promptly. However, if the treatment is not correct, it can cause even greater harm. Moreover, there are often patients who want to rely solely on self-treatment to seek recovery, which is impossible. However, with numerous hospitals lining the coast, choosing a doctor is not easy. Among them, the one with a long history, deep experience, and considerable reputation should be the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. The hospital's past treatment results and comprehensive equipment are well known and need not be repeated. I dare to offer a brief overview to those suffering from venereal diseases and syphilis.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Effectiveness of Shortwave Electrotherapy for Gonorrhea (See Qing)</h3>
<p>Young men who frequent brothels unfortunately contract gonorrhea. Some are negligent in treatment, while others are deceived by illegal treatments such as "one injection cures all" or "cured in three days," or they greedily buy fake medicines, resulting in chronic gonorrhea that cannot be completely cured for months, years, or even decades. This not only harms themselves but also infects their wives and concubines. As a result, men have no sperm, and women cannot conceive. It is said that gonorrhea can destroy a family line, and there is good reason for this. Old chronic gonorrhea, commonly known as "old white discharge," causes extensive sores on the urethral mucosa. In the posterior urethra, it is even worse than in the anterior urethra. The mucosal granules and glands are all infiltrated and swollen. The urine contains threads, and the discharge is sometimes present and sometimes not, generally thin. However, in the morning after waking up, the urethral opening is sealed by a small amount of mucus. Otherwise, there is no pain. At this time, gonococci are not easily demonstrated because, once gonorrhea becomes chronic, the gonococci often penetrate deep under the mucosa and lie dormant. When the opportunity arises, they will take advantage of the situation and relapse. Therefore, it is not easy to find gonococci in the mucus. Currently, the diagnosis of chronic gonorrhea mostly utilizes the injection of serum to cause the deeply hidden gonococci to reappear in the thin mucus. Then, microscopic examination can confirm it. Therefore, the treatment of chronic gonorrhea requires reliable diagnosis and excellent equipment to achieve radical cure. Previous people said that chronic gonorrhea is a stubborn disease that can never be cured because the diagnosis was not correct and there was no appropriate equipment to use. In recent times, science has become increasingly prosperous, and electrotherapy is booming. The invention of the shortwave electrotherapy machine is used to treat gonorrhea, especially chronic gonorrhea. Its effectiveness surpasses all other therapies. It emits high heat and penetrates deep into the urethral mucosa. It does not damage the tissue and can completely kill the gonococci. It is indeed a useful tool for treating gonorrhea. (Editor's note: To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools, especially in medicine. The Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession has a full range of electrotherapy equipment for treating gonorrhea. For example, regarding the shortwave diathermy machine, the hospital has many types, so those who go for treatment are treated according to their symptoms, and all are quickly and radically cured. The benefits of electrotherapy are indeed not shallow.)</p>
<h3>Free Testing for Gonorrhea in Men and Women (Wen Qin)</h3>
<p>Because several genital diseases, such as prostatitis, urethritis, and spermatorrhea, resemble the symptoms of gonorrhea, ordinary people often find it difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, they are secretly anxious and take all kinds of medicines indiscriminately, which only worsens the disease. There is also the case where gonorrhea is not cured, or gonorrhea is newly contracted, but it is not recognized as gonorrhea, resulting in delays. How wrong is that? To identify the cause of such diseases, it is best to examine the urine under a microscope, which can distinguish whether there are gonococci and determine whether it is gonorrhea. This avoids the drawbacks of blindly following medication. In Shanghai, there is a place that provides gonorrhea testing and does not charge a fee. That is only the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. It is also very convenient for women who suffer from leukorrhea to check whether it is gonorrhea, and they receive the same preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea and Fertility (Jing Qiu)</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea refers to the general term for secretions from the female reproductive organs. This leukorrhea is one of the most troubling issues for women. However, there are many types of leukorrhea. All diseases of the reproductive organs can cause it. The healthy uterine lining does not secrete much, only a small amount of serous secretion. The cervical canal is responsible for mucus secretion. Normally, the external cervical os is blocked by glassy mucus. If it slips, it leaks from the vagina to lubricate the vulva. If the amount of secretion increases, it leaks out constantly, contaminating and wetting the vulva and surrounding area or underclothes. This is leukorrhea, and 95% of leukorrhea comes from the uterus. The main symptom is chronic endometritis. Currently, it is said that leukorrhea coming from cervical canal mucositis is more common than endometritis. The color of the leaked leukorrhea varies. Some are glassy and viscous, some are white, mucous, and purulent, and some are thick and purulent. When leukorrhea leaks out, the vulva is moist, and one feels very uncomfortable. In obese women, the skin of the vulva and inner thighs becomes swollen and inflamed due to the stimulation of the secretions, leading to erosion, pain, and itching, which is very distressing. The course is very slow, and the patient's mind is uneasy, leading to neurasthenia in many cases. Examining the cause of leukorrhea, the most common cause is infection, mainly gonorrhea. Therefore, women suffering from leukorrhea should seek medical attention as soon as possible to find the cause. Once the cause is removed, the leukorrhea will heal itself. If gonococci invade the uterine mucosa and cause endometritis, and conception happens to occur, implantation will occur in the uterine mucosa. However, after two or three months, miscarriage is inevitable. Many women in our country are infected with gonorrhea, but most are too ashamed to seek medical treatment, leading to the ascent of gonococci and the spread of cervical mucositis, endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, and perimetritis, resulting in infertility. Isn't that a big mistake? Now, there is a very simple method that can cure gonorrheal leukorrhea and ordinary leukorrhea in the shortest possible time. The method is to purchase two types of medicine: one is an oral leukorrhea pill, and the other is a topical leukorrhea medicine. Use both at the same time, internal and external application, and complete success can be achieved. These two medicines are sold at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, the Father and Son Hospital. Those who have difficulty conceiving due to leukorrhea should try it.</p>
<h3>Red and White Leukorrhea (Xiao Yun)</h3>
<p>Red and white leukorrhea is a disease unique to women in our country. Not taking care during menstruation, improper postpartum care, and uncleanliness of daily cleaning supplies can all lead to diseases of the uterus and vagina. The result is increased inflammatory secretions. Mild cases involve yellowish-white and greasy substances, which is called white leukorrhea. In severe cases, ulcers occur on the internal mucosa, and superficial blood vessels are damaged. The secretions contain blood, which is called red leukorrhea. Some cases of red and white leukorrhea are caused by tumors in the uterus, some are caused by venereal viruses, and some are caused by weak and chlorotic constitutions and acute and chronic simple urogenital diseases. Since there are symptoms of red and white leukorrhea, there is a definite cause. However, women often delay seeking medical treatment due to shame, leading to the progression of the disease and becoming incurable, which is deeply regrettable. Now, the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, Shanghai, sells two types of medicine, "Oral Leukorrhea Pills" and "Topical Leukorrhea Medicine," which are extremely effective in treating gonorrheal leukorrhea and simple red and white leukorrhea in women. They are the only self-treatment remedies for those who are too ashamed to seek medical treatment and for those who live in remote inland areas lacking good doctors and medicines. Women sufferers should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Drawbacks of Chronic Gonorrhea (Qi Hong)</h3>
<p>After contracting gonorrhea, if one does not pay attention to hygiene, it is easy to develop chronic gonorrhea. On the surface, this chronic gonorrhea does not cause any pain. However, the number of bacteria increases day by day, which is a natural occurrence. During the latent period, there is no feeling at all, but once it breaks out, the severity of the disease is several times greater than the pain of the acute disease. Moreover, gonorrhea can lead to orchitis, prostatitis, lymphadenitis, and swollen and painful limbs and joints. Even if the inflammation subsides, nodules often remain. If small, they will become inflamed, and if severe, the organs will lose their function. The most obvious case is that once orchitis has been suffered, procreation will be hindered. Once the prostate gland becomes inflamed, premature ejaculation and impotence may follow. Therefore, those with gonorrhea should seek early treatment and ensure that it is completely cured. Do not delay, causing many drawbacks and regretting it too late. However, improper treatment can cause even greater harm, so choosing a doctor must be done with caution. The Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession in Shanghai is a more reliable venereal disease hospital in Shanghai. It employs both male and female doctors with rich clinical experience and complete electrotherapy equipment. They are attentive and thorough during diagnosis and treatment, all of which are commendable.</p>
<h3>Words from the Heart</h3>
<p>The lungs are the only important organ responsible for breathing, and they are also a region susceptible to pathogen invasion. Many people in our country suffer from lung disease because tuberculosis bacteria spread very easily. Once infected, various symptoms such as coughing, spitting blood, emaciation, and night sweats occur. The ulceration of the lungs also expands daily, and the human body cannot withstand it. However, in the early stages of lung disease, the symptoms are very mild, so people often ignore it. Now that science is advanced, X-rays can be used to see through the lungs. Any disease can be seen at a glance. Now, the Father and Son Hospital in Ningbo Road, French Concession, offers public lung health examinations at a very low cost. Therefore, gentlemen, merchants, and scholars go for examinations in an endless stream. It is indeed good news for the medical community.</p>
<h3>Talking About a Bumper Harvest (Meng Ruo)</h3>
<p>Our country has suffered from frequent disasters in recent years, and the lives of farmers across the country are unspeakably miserable. Fortunately, the weather this year was suitable, resulting in a bumper harvest. Anhui Province even broke a 30-year record. Amidst the bankruptcies in the countryside, this is truly a miracle! However, does this year's bumper harvest really benefit the average farmer? I'm afraid it's hard to say.</p>
<p>On the surface, a bumper harvest is undoubtedly good for farmers. Farmers in various parts of our country work hard all year round, and what they harvest in the autumn, after paying rent and taxes, is only enough to fill their stomachs. In bad years, the situation is extremely miserable! Hunger is not even worth mentioning. Some even have to sell their wives and children to barely make a living. In recent years, most farmers have been struggling with life in this way. Because of this year's bumper harvest in various places, the lives of farmers may not be prosperous, but they should be more comfortable than in previous years. This is something to be thankful for!</p>
<p>However, this is only a superficial view. In reality, this year's bumper harvest will still not have much of a good impact on the lives of the average farmer in our country because the suffering that disasters inflict on farmers is too cruel! The decline of rural areas across the country today is not unrelated to the impact of years of disasters. Therefore, although this year's harvest is bountiful, the lives of farmers in various places cannot be compensated even by a fraction of what they suffered in previous years. At most, they can only catch their breath temporarily. The cheap grain hurts farmers, and if this bumper harvest is not properly adjusted, farmers may suffer even more.</p>
<p>However, even a temporary respite is hard to come by. Do not look at the recent celebrations in various places, where farmers hold grain-offering ceremonies and raise funds to put on plays. The joy can be imagined. The government has also issued orders to hold bumper harvest celebrations to commemorate the occasion. However, when it comes to celebrating a good year and holding celebrations to entertain the farmers, it is permissible because the average farmer in our country is usually too hard-working and rarely has time for entertainment. If it is to be used to embellish peace, it is completely unnecessary because the current situation in rural areas in various places does not give any cause for optimism. An occasional bumper harvest cannot hide the bleak reality! The anti-rent movement in Suzhou did not happen long ago!</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of "celebrating," it is better to promote some knowledge about improving agriculture, increasing production, and how to revitalize rural areas, and to guide farmers to improve their own lives. Using entertainment to promote rural development would be timely!</p>
<h3>Old Cow, Rest Sheep</h3>
<p>The morning of the market day, Ashun got up before dawn. There was no light in the room. In the darkness, he habitually picked up his dry tobacco pipe by the bed, habitually loaded it with tobacco, and took out a match from his pocket to light it. In the moment the match lit, he saw his wife sleeping soundly, and the scene of last night's quarrel unfolded before his eyes in the darkness.</p>
<p>There were two market days in the town every month. The night before each market day, Ashun always had to discuss something with his wife, wheat, soybeans, vegetable oil seeds, those things that were their food, to the market to exchange for money. But Ashun was a drunkard. After selling the goods, he would sit in the Hexing Hotel until sunset, pouring all the money in his pocket into his stomach before staggering home under the moonlight. In this way, the old couple would quarrel every market day, and sometimes Ashun would even beat his wife due to his drunken state.</p>
<p>Last night, Ashun asked his wife for something again. His wife did not answer him for a long time. Ashun opened the hemp sacks and jar lids in the back room in a fit of pique, measuring out half a liter of soybeans in total.</p>
<p>"Hey, you say," Ashun returned to the room and threw half a liter of soybeans at the foot of the bed, shouting at his wife, "Where did you hide the barley?"</p>
<p>His wife glanced at him and remained silent. Ashun seemed to be really angry. He hit the table with his fist, and the flame of the lamp flickered twice, emitting a puff of black smoke.</p>
<p>"Old hag, I'm asking you where you hid the barley?"</p>
<p>His wife turned up the lamp before answering her husband, "Are you still asking me? Ask your own stomach!"</p>
<p>"What?" Ashun's stomach was full of anger. He hit the table even harder, and the lamp went out with just one flicker. But he immediately took out a match from his pocket and lit it, "My stomach can't hold that much!"</p>
<p>His wife sneered, "It can't hold that much, but it can pour that much down! Old cow!"</p>
<p>Ashun took a breath like a cow and fell back into the bamboo chair. He calculated how much barley he could harvest from eight acres of land, how much rent he would pay, how much debt he would repay, and how much would be left over. It was already the middle of July. Since the beginning of spring, he had gone to the market thirteen times and sold how much. At this point, he noticed the half a liter of soybeans at the foot of the bed and looked at his wife's fierce hag face. He shook his head, trying to shake off the numbers he was calculating, and lowered his head to bury it in his palms.</p>
<p>"Old cow," unexpectedly, his wife spoke, "Have you figured it out clearly? I'm asking you what you're going to put in your stomach for the second half of the year?"</p>
<p>Now Ashun had no words to answer. He resented that he had too little land, only eight acres. Wouldn't it be great if he had eighty acres? Next year, he would definitely rent a few more acres to farm. Old Master Zhang and Zhu Sanye in the city, Ashun only had to say a few nice words, and they would definitely let him farm! So, like a tenant farmer with eighty acres, he thought that the old cow in the cowshed was really useless. Farming eight acres, drawing water, and plowing the land were already too much for Ashun. What was the old cow good for if he farmed eighty acres? Good! Ashun raised his head from his palms, his eyes already filled with the hope of eighty acres.</p>
<p>"Old hag!" he said, "Next year, we'll farm a few more acres and sell that old cow to get a new one..."</p>
<p>"What? Old cow (referring to Ashun)!" his wife interrupted, "You're dreaming—sell the old cow!"</p>
<p>"I want to farm eighty acres. What's that old cow good for?"</p>
<p>His wife's face turned green. Her hands trembled as she stood up from the stool, walked to her husband, and almost cried, "Old cow, think clearly! Sell the cow... how are we going to live?"</p>
<p>"What do you know!" Ashun felt that his wife was too unromantic. He pushed her heavily and climbed into bed to sleep. In his dream, he seemed to hear his wife crying.</p>
<p>Ashun finished smoking a pipe of tobacco, and the sky was already bright. The first thing he saw was the half a liter of soybeans at the foot of the bed. He turned his head back. His wife was still asleep. He gently carried the hemp sack of soybeans out the door. As he walked past the cowshed, he added feed and patted the "old cow" affectionately, "Old cow, I won't sell you. We're the same!" The old cow mooed, seeming to understand its master's meaning.</p>
<p>Ashun went to the market excitedly.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu (Li Tian)</h3>
<p>Gulangyu is the Little Qingdao of the South, the treasure trove of our Fujian. On this small island of less than ten square li, there are magnificent Western-style villas and quiet paths covered with greenery. Although even the powerful and wealthy can only use sedan chairs for transportation, one can occasionally see Chinese-style buildings similar to temples dotted among them, but this does not detract from its pride and adds to its tranquility and ancient charm.</p>
<p>"Wow, what kind of place is this!"</p>
<p>Every vagabond or country bumpkin from the north is always surprised when they step onto it. Even the island's residents often boast about it.</p>
<p>"Come on! Come and play on our Gulangyu!"</p>
<p>Indeed, Gulangyu is a good place, incomparably beautiful. There, not only are there towering banks and noble hotels, hospitals like "Salvation" and "Charity," general associations and cinemas, but also a "Maid Rescue Group" where you can marry a wife for just a hundred yuan. People in the mainland, even if they are not fortunate enough to spend a night there, always want to take a look. Especially when a change occurs in the area, the gentry and rich all bring their families and "retire" to this utopia because it is an international concession and an isolated island facing Luyu—Xiamen, only three li away!</p>
<p>The residents there have something of the Anglo-Saxon spirit. They are very polite and dislike the coarse and hoarse voices of mainlanders. Most of them are devout Christians. All of the island's dozen or so primary and secondary schools are established by the church. This summer, the second national Christian</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>Baptism Conference was held on the island. Because it is not a commercial city, there is none of the hustle and bustle of a businessman, so the residents generally seem very comfortable and peaceful. Especially the young ladies; their attire is no less than that in Shanghai; it's just that perhaps they are too idle. They always seem to be endlessly talking about various household affairs of other families. As long as a moment ago someone committed suicide because of unrequited love or set fire for love, everyone hears about it. Not long ago, I went to visit a friend there. He told me humorously, "Some of my sister's friends were just discussing, 'Does Gulangyu have a sutra flavor?'" But they have five or six hundred middle-aged unmarried women who piously declare that they want to dedicate their lives to the Lord—Jesus Christ. However, not long ago, some kind housewives were troubled by the island's Bureau of Works' enforcement of maid registration.</p>
<p>"A maid has to pay ten dollars a month in donations, it's cheaper to hire a Nanny!"</p>
<p>They just kept telling each other this. This is indeed true. A Nanny costs at most five or six dollars a month. According to general estimates, one-fifth of the island's 20,000 residents belong to the Nanny and maid class.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a good place. In the summer, we can always see countless young men and women "swimmers" on the surrounding beaches, wearing all kinds of tight-fitting swimsuits, showing smiling faces, playing and "fighting" with the waves.</p>
<p>However, it is ultimately mysterious. There are not only new and old Eighteen Tigers or Thirty-six Tigers gangster groups, frequently busted kidnapping organizations, and figures lurking with various party affiliations, but also a devilish black hand plotting and calculating how to plunder southern Fujian, Fujian, and even all of South China to an island not far away. That black hand is now in every corner of southern Fujian, playing the "autonomy" drama.</p>
<h3>Old Colleague (Li Ang)</h3>
<p>After a minor illness, I lay weakly on that worn rattan chair. When the bread seller's cry broke the silence of the alley, the warm autumn sun only left a diagonal piece stuck on the top of the small window. An insect was chirping in the cage, foreshadowing its final fate. My wife had been worried about my illness lately and no longer cared about feeding the green beans. The beans in the bamboo cage were already shriveled and black. Perhaps it was chirping endlessly for food. This symbol of shouting for a living, like a sharp needle, pricked my scar again: I had been abandoned by life. For the past two or three years, I had often bitten my lips to get through the long string of mud-like days.</p>
<p>How to make up for life in the future? I was blankly facing the sunlight on the window that was about to disappear when familiar footsteps came up the stairs. "It's Zhu Peisheng again," I recognized his broken leather shoes with iron nails on the heels. That's right, without a doubt, a brown, shiny, triangular face appeared at the door. His hair, which had not been cut for two or three months, was like a crow's nest. His sideburns had extended below his ears, making his face look particularly small and dirty. His willow-striped shirt had no collar, and the white canvas trousers had no seams. He was a colleague from the tobacco factory three years ago, a strong young man who came from a very miserable background. He had lost his parents when he was young and was sent to an orphanage. The manager of the tobacco factory was a director of the orphanage. After graduation, he was assigned to work in the leaf department of the factory, swallowing smoke ash day and night, unable to see the bright sunshine, a very hard job. At that time, I was in charge of the accounts in the machine room of the factory. Every time he called me "Mr. Chen" in a respectful tone, I always smiled and nodded at him.</p>
<p>Now, as three years ago, he still calls me "Mr. Chen" every time he comes, and I still smile and nod at him. However, the state of mind of both parties has changed drastically. Having lost the support of life in the same way, I am distressed by the burden of having a family, and he is distressed by being alone without a fixed home. Although he is still trapped in a lonely situation, the "orphanage" is no longer his. He walked into the room weakly. I asked him to sit on the bed. He did not sit down, but took out a stack of paper from his pocket. While checking the mimeographed letter from the "Career Guidance Center" and a guarantee with size four lead type, leaving many blanks to be filled in, he said: "Something has happened to me, a newly opened underwear shop, I can go in right away, but they asked me to get a guarantee. They also want a reliable shop as a guarantor." He put the rest of the pieces of paper into his pocket and continued, "Mr. Chen, I am such a lonely person, who can I find? Alas, alas..." I understood what he meant. His hopeful eyes were pressing me. I was still lying on the rattan chair, turning my head, thinking, "How can I tell him?" I am "willing in spirit but powerless in strength."</p>
<p>"This...this...it needs some thinking...(a long silence)...</p>
<p>For example, your director's place, isn't he a very respected person in society! You can go to him, and he is a famous philanthropist, he wouldn't refuse you, would he? Unfortunately, I can't help you, you also understand me..."</p>
<p>Zhu Peisheng's face became as gloomy as the sunlight faded. His left palm rubbed against his right palm, his eyes moved from my face to his own feet, and he blinked incessantly, with the same expression as when he was reprimanded by the manager three years ago, with his head lowered and his mouth twisted. He seemed to have a belly full of grievances—"It won't work," he shook his head; "The director doesn't want to see me, he hates me to death, he often scolds me in front of his colleagues for not being progressive, for being useless trash, saying that I have ruined his reputation." He also told me that the tobacco factory manager had reported some "disgraceful things" about him to the director. Therefore, he would be permanently ridiculed and excluded from the living circle. Is society really sacred and inviolable? Otherwise, why can't it forgive an orphan, a young man who accidentally misbehaved! Reputation, ha ha, this thing is the sharp teeth of society, how many people are swallowed and buried forever.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could say to this old colleague in front of me. I had no "status" to guarantee him. Empty comfort and impractical ways were no different from joking with him. So, we remained silent to each other. The sunlight outside the small window had completely disappeared, and the sound of the bread seller had long gone. Only the mountain insect in the bamboo cage chirped as if it were its last fate.</p>
<h3>A Certain Night (Fei Xiangdong)</h3>
<p>How short is dusk? After saying goodbye at a friend's house, he started walking towards home because he was poor and couldn't afford the tram. So, he walked in the cool autumn wind, and soon it was completely dark.</p>
<p>In the silent alley, dim yellow light shone on the terrazzo floor. Several playful children were still playing hide-and-seek here. He passed by these children and couldn't help but sigh, "Where is my golden childhood?" He asked himself and turned the corner, entering the back door of the house where he lived. Coincidentally, the landlady—this stout woman—came out. She looked quite amiable in the past, but at this moment she showed a fierce face, demanding rent from her tenant in a harsh voice:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hua, I'm sorry, but you have to pay the rent! It's been two months in total. Do you think people's houses can be given to you for free?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Jiang, I'm really sorry... I really because of... because... Give me three to five days, and I'll definitely find a way." The young tenant was caught off guard by the question and trembled involuntarily. His answer was stuttering.</p>
<p>"Three to five days to find a way—how many times have you said that, Mr. Hua? I've been polite. If it were someone else, they wouldn't be so easy to talk to!"</p>
<p>"Yes...yes!"</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the landlady's body turning to one side, leaving a not-very-large gap in the doorway, he flashed in with a very agile posture and went upstairs with a thud.</p>
<p>When this young tenant was talking to the landlady at the back door, his wife, who lived in the front room on the third floor, had already heard it. She sat on the edge of the bed, looking at the sleeping child on the bed, and kept crying. She had tasted too much of the bitterness of life. Now, her husband was unemployed, and her child was sick... The door to happiness was so far away from them! Two years ago, when they were newly married, everything was happiness for her. Who would have thought that good days were always short-lived?</p>
<p>Hearing her husband's footsteps coming upstairs, she hurriedly wiped away her tears. Then the door was pushed open, and he dragged his tired body in. The two looked at each other in silence for a while before he approached the bed and looked at the sleeping child with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>He asked, "When did the child fall asleep? Was there anything unusual?"</p>
<p>"This afternoon was still quite good," she raised her head and said to him. "She fell asleep less than a quarter of an hour ago... Did you borrow any money outside?"</p>
<p>As soon as money was mentioned, his brows furrowed tightly. He told his wife that he had been running around all afternoon, first looking for a friend who worked in a trading company, but he couldn't find him in the office or at his house. Then he went to look for an old classmate, but this guy seemed to have known his intentions for a long time and kept talking about being poor, making him unable to open his mouth. He had wanted to leave for a long time, but the old classmate insisted on him having dinner. So, he didn't get back until it was dark...</p>
<p>His wife had kept the cooked rice aside, waiting for him to come back and eat together. Now that he had eaten, she had to sit alone at the small square table and have her dinner alone. However, how could she eat? When she picked up her chopsticks, she turned her head and asked him again:</p>
<p>"The landlady urged you to pay the rent again just now, didn't she? What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>Yes, what were they going to do? Even he, who usually thought he was quite capable, couldn't answer. However, looking at his wife's depressed face, he had no choice but to endure the sadness and comfort her: "It's okay, the amount of rent isn't that much, I'll find a way..."</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the surroundings of the alley were even more silent. The autumn wind blew bleakly, and the scene looked desolate. Lying on the bed with his wife, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, he felt that the night was so long, continuing as if there was no end. The midnight chimes came from afar, swept past his ears, and gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>He couldn't sleep all night. At dawn, in the twilight, he found his wife crying secretly, her tears wetting the pillow and quilt. So, he couldn't help but let his tears flow out too.</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Shanxi Person (Sheri)</h3>
<p>I pushed open the door, and at a glance, it was him again!</p>
<p>His hair was already gray, his cheeks were thin, and wrinkles were piled up on his forehead. He was old! But he still didn't grow a beard, and his chin was cleanly shaved.</p>
<p>—Why don't you grow a beard, old man?</p>
<p>Once, I asked him this. He touched his chin and frowned:</p>
<p>—A beard is the most annoying thing!</p>
<p>He was from Shanxi, and he sang a good Qinqiang opera. Two years ago, he still loved to hum. In the lonely dusk, after a dizzy drink, he would tap on the edge of the table with his fingernails and hum, murmuring. With his unique deep voice and local flavor, he temporarily placed that wanderer's heart in the memories of the song.</p>
<p>Oh, wanderer of the world!</p>
<p>He hadn't returned to his hometown for fifteen years, but he remembered the appearance of his hometown: how high the mountains were, how deep the water was, how many forests there were, he remembered it very clearly. That day, he talked to me about his home: he had a daughter-in-law, and when he left home fifteen years ago, she was still very pretty. He really couldn't bear to leave her! But there was no way, his hometown couldn't support him. He left with tears in his eyes; once he left, he didn't go home for fifteen years.</p>
<p>He also had a son, who his daughter-in-law told him about in a message a month after he left. Counting it, he should be fifteen years old this year, and he hadn't even seen his father, that little thing! (To be continued)</p>
