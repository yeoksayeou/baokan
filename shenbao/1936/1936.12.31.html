<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>在日本，只內閣的更迭也呌做『政變』。</p>
<p>自廣田組閣以來，「政變說」是每月都可以見到的。但，直到今日，廣田內閣仍然存在。然而，到今日，替廣田內閣算命的人們，也更多了。例如：十二月十九日的東京讀賣新聞，載有「內閣的運命」；改造新年號有「廣田內閣的運命」；以及十二月二十一日的東京朝日新聞，載有「政黨的反政府態度」等。當然，决沒有永遠不變的政，也沒有永遠不更迭的內閣。日本的政變，廣田內閣的沒落，也是不能逃出此種運命的。</p>
<p>决定廣田內閣之運命的主要問題，是：廣田內閣應完成的政治任務已經完成否？若未完成，今後尙能完成否？廣田內閣的任務，在內政方面的有二：第一，卽所謂「庶政一新」；第二，卽通過龐大的預算案。在外交方面的也有二：第一爲中日交涉，第二爲日俄交涉。這也可以說：在內政方面爲「準戰時的統制强化」；在外交方面爲「大陸政策的强化」。</p>
<p>現在，大體上可以說是完成的，只有在閣議上已經通過龐大預算案。至於「庶政一新」呢？軍部雖已提出『行政機構改革案』，但至今日尙未實現。說到廣田外交，則樞密院，各政黨，以及一般日本輿論，都認爲失敗了。</p>
<p>但是閣議通過了的空前預算案，現在正成爲被攻擊的一個焦點。高興這一預算案的，只有軍部和日本、的軍需工業資本家等，多數的日本國民只有縐眉頭。預算膨脹的基礎，大半建立在增稅上。此次的增稅，一舉便是六億元。別的稅不用說，舉個小小的例子吧：香烟爲一般國民的日常必需品，日本香烟中，有一種呌做「金鼠牌」的，十枝一盒，每盒價格七仙，這差不多是中小商人及勞動者所愛吸的。據朝日新聞的估計，因增稅的結果，此種烟漲到八仙一盒，每年政府可增收三千萬元。此種負擔的加重，是一般人民極易感到的。至於勞動者們，因增稅之故，物價上騰，實質上便等於减少工資。這眞所謂「月兒灣灣照九洲，幾家歡喜幾家愁」了。廣田內閣所完成的此種工作（增稅），固是廣田內閣尙未倒塌的主因之一，但也正是一般人民反對的主因之一。資產階級的各政黨，倒不是眞要反對政府的大增稅，只不過是利用之爲政爭的工具，期圖在新年後的議會中，打擊廣田內閣吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c54">百靈廟慰勞歸來（下） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 亮東</p>
<p>在武川的一夜，誰都凍得够受了。我到夜半耐不住冷便獨自起來，聽外面戍兵號聲，東方慢慢的露出曙光，景象是十分壯烈的。</p>
<p>十三日一早我們繼續北發，氣候是更冷了。但武川以北的形勢，看來又不同了，極目瞭望，一片荒野的草原漠地，不見一棵樹，也不見一條河，天和地好像格外接近了。汽車在草原上走，也無所謂道路，結果走錯了六十多里地，到一個烏蘭花洞的地方，已經是下午二點多鐘了。那面遠遠的可以看見敵人投彈炸燬的土坑和馬屍，烏蘭花洞也是要地，我們的士兵正在那兒修建碉堡等工事，在他們的駐防所裏伸一伸腰，繼續北發。</p>
<p>四時，許多野羊整着跟我們跑了一陣，百靈廟在望了，於是大家又興奮地歌唱起來。我們在百里不見人烟的漢地亂跑了一整天，忽兒見宮殿巍峨的廟宇，四周山環水抱，各口要嶺多有我軍荷槍實彈的守兵，經省府代表接洽後，便直開廟行。剛到廟門時，見地上滿飛着碎紙條，黃的白的，據說是喇嘛們唸的經卷。廟東有許多蒙古包聽說以前都是蒙旗貴族住的，現在全跑光了。蒙古包就在廟裏也有，那是因爲蒙民住不慣瓦房的綠故。</p>
<p>我們下車後當承一位孟副官長股勤招待，料理我們住所晚餐，連聲說：「你們辛苦了，這地方苦得很，住得不舒服。」他們的招待眞是使我們威到漸愧。我們一組分住在第八連第五班，當我們行李搬進去時，他們連忙替我們收拾坑地，屋子裏都是用牛馬糞晒乾了來生火的。一忽兒又有位周副官來談，在他的談話裏可以知道這次百靈廟的收復，他們確是用死的决心和毅力來戰勝的，他說因爲隊伍從武川出發，到二分子已都凍餓得够了，士兵都下决心打下百靈廟去吃飽肚子，因爲到大廟附近若是退下來，不是凍死也便要餓死，隊伍攻佔百靈廟眞是用肉搏衝鋒奪過來的</p>
<p>晚餐是一大盆麵片見，伙伕欣然說還有團部裏送來的菜，原來那僅是由包頭慰勞團送來的豆子辣醬，一碗豆子辣醬，就很難得，於此可見他們生活的苦况。但我們吃得非常高興，因爲麵都是敵人的東西，後來團部裏還提一壺酒來，說也是敵人的特產，請我們嘗那勝利品　。</p>
<p>餐後我們都到團部去見孫蘭峯旅長和袁慶榮參謀長，由代表分別致慰勞辭，袁參謀長代孫旅長一一詳細答謝，每一句話都是充滿着抗敵的熱忱，尤其對於目前國際形勢以及敵人在滿蒙經營的意義，精密地剖析，眞使我們欽佩，欽佩我們目前的武裝同志對於政治經濟能認識得如此淸楚。他說這次攻克百靈廟乃是全國民衆一致抗敵的要求的勝利，我們所以要收復百靈廟乃是爲保衛新，甘，寗的咽喉。此次從敵人手裏得到最可貴的並不是報章所載的幾百萬袋麵和幾百萬槍彈，而是所有關於敵人侵略內蒙的秘密計劃，好比關於內蒙的軍用地圖，直到現在我們還沒有這樣縮形萬分之一的精細地圖，若要親自測繪，時間且不算，單就經費就要化三千多萬的估價呢。記者因爲在綏遠担任一點蒙旗的教育工作，順便問及此次德王變節後對於蒙旗的關係，百靈廟有個小學校，裏面就以日，蒙文爲主，以前還有一個蒙古軍官學校，專以造就蒙古軍人，這些也無不有某國人在裏面策劃。</p>
<p>十四日一早，我們就上山去看工事，山谷裏還有不少屍體，凍得和鐵一般僵硬，爲狀極慘，最難看的是兩個某國軍官的屍體，面目被血肉汚塗，我們拉出光亮的地方照了幾個相，我在一個屍體近旁還拾着一個臂布章，上面寫着：「蒙古陸軍騎兵第二軍第七師第二十一團第二連第二排第四班二等兵古爾札布」的字樣。</p>
<p>在山口頂上，滿堆着機關槍彈殼，據說我軍曾在那兒肉搏過十七决之多。現在我軍的防禦工事可鞏固了，只是整天整夜輪流守衛的情形太苦，尤其是在深夜每二連有一個蒙古包在山下，雖然一小時換班一次，但冰天凍地的山嶺上，荷槍實彈巡哨，景象是很嚴肅而堅苦的。</p>
<p>下山回廟，我們又訪問最近廟北達爾罕旗雲王的代表沙貝子先生，許多蒙古喇嘛，都如喪家之犬那樣，沉着臉在收拾殘破的遺物。他們都不會說漢話，行動很遲笨，絳紅色的長袍，髒得比刮刀布都厲害，高登靴看來極不方便。據說這些喇嘛第一次回來又偸偸的回去吿密，夜裏還把我方的電綫破壞，我軍受害不少，因此現在返廟的都要有人確保才成了。</p>
<p>十時半我們告別了百靈廟登車重上歸途，臨行時我們一邊歌唱一邊喊起宏亮的口號來：</p>
<p>「抗敵的戰士萬歲！百靈廟萬歲！卅五軍萬歲！中華民族萬歲！全國民衆一致團結起來！」</p>
<p>回返歸綏已是萬家燈火的時候了，我們越過山南，就覺得綏遠的氣候好像和暖如春。的確，百靈廟慰勞歸來，帶給我們不少民族戰鬥的朝氣和春意。（十二月廿四日於歸綏。）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c55">這一年的回顧 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>民國二十五年已到最後一天了。這一年來國事的演變在民族復興的過程上有着莫大的意義。我們今天就在這裏簡略地來探討一番。</p>
<p>在這一年中。我國是從極大的危難中得救了。現在綏遠戰爭雖然還未結束。然而經過了這幾月來前敵將士的英勇抗戰。和全國民衆的熱烈援助。敵人卽使頑强。終究有些喪膽餒氣了。僞匪軍根據地百靈廟和大廟子的先後收復。不但使我們愈加增强了自信心。而且還把中華民族的偉大力量。顯示給全世界看。在今日的情勢之下。僞匪軍背後的國際武力總該澈底明白我全國民衆已經抱定用全力來保衛國土的决心了罷。</p>
<p>綏遠戰爭的勝利固然是中國復興的曙光。然而在過去一年中間。還有値得我們無限慶幸的。就是兩廣異動和西安事變的和平解决。這兩大事件。在外患如此嚴重的情勢之下。很有動搖國本的可能。可是挑撥離間的陰謀只不過起了暫時的作用。而中央當局爲國爲民的偉大精神。和全國民衆對於和平統一的迫切要求。終於使這兩大不幸事件。在很短約期間。獲得了和平而妥善的解决。這結果。全國人心。在中央領導之下。愈加團結起來中國統一的基礎也就愈加鞏固了。</p>
<p>中國各省在文化經濟各方面。程度不齊。要統一本是非常困難的。今年的兩大不幸事件的解决。無疑地克復了統一前途不少的困難。可是統一局面的進展。有大部分却還得歸功於經濟建設。這一年來國內雖屢經重大的憂患。而社會金融和國際外匯始終穩定。這顯然是法幣政策的成效。此外在交通方面。今年完成了南北主要幹綫粵漢鐵路。擴展了公路和航空綫數千公里。在農業方面。合作社和倉庫的設施也大有發展。這種經濟建設的成績當然是促進中國眞正統一的重要因素。</p>
<p>今日的中國正堅穩地向眞正統一的目標邁進着。誰想阻擋這一種趨勢。誰就得在我全民族的一致咀咒之下。自趨於滅亡。全國民衆在蔣委員長蒙難期間的憂急。以及在他回京以後的歡祝。正是要求統一的意志最顯著的表現。因爲今日的世界是把他當作統一的中國的象徵的。</p>
<p>在這歲序更新之際。蔣委員長一再表示着倦勤的意思。這是我國當今的局勢所不能容許的。昨日中央常會第二次决議懇切挽留。民衆的公意。當然也是如此。我們素知蔣委員長勇於負責。逆料他在出處上。總會順應全民的要求的。</p>

<p>— 費仁</p>
<p>—「爲着幾千人死了我們父子兩人也不要緊的」—</p>
<p>福建東岸沿海，有無數巨石大礁立在水中，有時出水成爲一堆堆小島，有時沒入水裏，航海家一不小心就碰上去，把船撞個粉碎。同時那些出水的小島又往往作成海盜的魔窟，乘機搶刦。福建本位置在東海與南海交流的衝要上，風浪特別險要。平時好好的，但雲頭一起，兇黑的風暴立刻爆發，掀翻航輪，否則要就把牠打到礁石上去。自然，這些危險在白天裏總是較少，可以防備，因爲礁石上總有警吿的記號，經騐深熟的航海家也是會看雲頭風色的。可是夜裏，夜裏是福建海上航海家的難星！</p>
<p>一切危險中之最危險的地方是柘洋島外的一羣礁島！</p>
<p>自然界爲人類預備了磨難，難道人類就削滅了猛進的雄心不成？不會的。爲着征服牠，人類就發明了燈塔的用處。法子很簡單，就是在近岸一個較大的島上築一座極高的塔，在塔頂上燃一個極大極亮的大燈可以照到全海面幾十百里之遠，使航海家行到這危險地帶仍然有白日那種光明的保障，不致於碰到意外的禍事。燈塔旣這樣要緊，所以守塔的人也就非常重要。他必須家庭簡單無掛慮，必須有相當大的年齡，尤其必須身子結實無嗜好。因爲這樣所以五十歲的麥林作了柘洋島外島燈塔的守塔者。他別無親屬，只有個九歲的女兒瑞思。父女兩人守在那孤島上伴着孤獨的燈塔，每天晚上按時點上那一盞大燈，保護千千萬萬，貧富老少的過往航客，從沒有失過事。</p>
<p>說起這父女兩人的過去歷史也是很苦的。父親原是柘洋灣裏的漁夫。灣裏魚多，這男人身子壯，能挽幾百斤的大網，又能入水捕捉海參蝦蚌。在魚市塲上他的買賣不算壞。可是日子久了，他的生意不好起來。那時進口的海菜太多，從琉球，從臺灣和東洋每年運來無數海菜魚類。人家捕魚是用大輪船在遠海用大機器起網，用槍打魚，捕魚船上人手非常多，所以旣無危險，所得的效果非常大。捕得的魚用輸船裝運由他們的政府免稅，有時還免了運費。送來中國。中國因爲條約上的關係，對於這些洋貨只能收很少的稅，有時免稅。當然這些進口海貨就要比中國漁人的魚類賤得多，人家都愛買他們的。中國漁人賣了自己的性命才弄得點魚，一家衣食所在，還要付很高的稅，賣時自然要貴，加以又有魚行販子轉一道手脚，又賺點錢，就更其貴了。</p>
<p>那時那麥林一家四口：他的大兒子，他的妻，還有一個小瑞思只有七歲。他們都是身子堅强，只除了麥大娘因爲生育太多，體弱不堪，只能作作管管家裏的事。小瑞思雖只七歲，却一向跟她父兄在海上生活。漁船一駕出去，父子兩人撒網，她就把舵。父親沒入水裏去，她就逼着哥哥守船，自己也跳下水去撈一些蝦蟹之類。偶而不小心，手被蟹子夾了一下，總是緊握着拳頭，把個小臉蹩得鐵靑，一句話也不說。哥哥問她，她反而瞪眼說哥哥藐視她。她最喜歡用鐃鈎去刺魚。父親特爲作一個較輕的鐃鈎給她，三人同時捕魚。這海面旣是多礁多險，就不免常常闖禍。有時燈塔上失事，或守塔人失職，或因塔建築不好被風吹倒，不但夜裏出亂子，連白天也有壞事的時候。父子三人遇見待救的人，聽到呼救聲，總要將漁船划出去。這時節瑞思很勇敢的站在船頭或伸下鐃鈎槳竿給水中的人，或是自己跳下水去，從來不肯讓父兄搶先。她的力氣大，海水把她刷鍊得筋骨壯，海上的危險生活又養得她豪勇剛强，愛好工作。她不知什麽呌危險，更不知世上有難事。所以環境雖糟，生活雖無保障，有他們三人支持着，打魚生活也並非絕對過不下去的，如若沒有下文那種新的敲剝事情發生。</p>
<p>政治不良，社會不安，鬧出亂子就該人民去受罪。福建海上原有海盜，都是一班無衣無食，好勇鬭狠的窮漢。始而他們盤踞在海島上打刦爲生，那些坐領乾薪，躱避職務的水警局，只要海盜們不來找尋他們已是大幸，那裏肯去觸犯他們？最好是海盜也體貼他們，從來不去驚動那些偉人將軍們的船隻，只不過打刦商人，搜括一些半窮半富的旅客們。海盜的勢力坐大起來，實行劃分勢力範圍，佔據洋面來作水上大王。他們吩咐海岸漁戶按月繳納海面稅，才可自由打魚，誰若不繳，便把誰綁去吊打，限期交費，過期再不交，連人綑上大石拋下海底去。漁民對於大王們只有服從，因爲自己抵抗是不行的，沒有傢伙：若告到官裏，反而有洩漏消息給海盜的危險呢。</p>
<p>麥家的日子因爲這樣就更麻煩。起先是衣服不够穿，吃倒不成問題，除了那病瘦的母親外，父子三人都頗肉硬筋强，不像不够吃的。後來連吃的方面竟也有點顧不週全。該吃四碗的，吃了兩碗半，摸摸肚子，再喝一碗水，也就覺得可以對付了，把該煮飯的米改煮稀粥的時候也不少。福建人吃粥當飯原是常事，但那粥却實在就是爛飯，不是這班窮漁人鍋裏的東西。麥家三個人减食並有有减輕他們的困難。賣體力的人少吃束西力量就不足，工作也不好。小瑞思的大圓臉蛋慢慢光起來，她爸爸和哥哥的眉頭常是蹙起。捐稅債務他們欠了一大堆。</p>
<p>一天，瑞思的哥哥獨自駕船出海去，到黑沒回。麥林帶着女兒瑞思借了別人的船划出海去找尋，又走到家家朋友和相熟的酒店裏去打聽，都沒一點消息。小瑞思想哥哥必是在海上失了事，她倚仗自己的本事，一夜哭着要爸爸和她再下海去找，爸爸却不理她。兩個大人的心裏有些擔心，怕兒子不是掉在海裏倒是失落在島上了，但是他們却不把這話對瑞思講，哄她睡去。第二天他們由酒店得到了兒子的消息。果然，三個月沒交海面稅的禍事已經爆發，兒子現在被綑在海盜的地牢裏，限在兩天之內將錢交淸了才能出去，這件事怎樣去對付呢？作主人的人剜空了心思也不會想得到奴才的苦處，因爲他根本不知道錢是不容易弄到手的東西，他只覺得你是有錢，却捨不得拿出來交稅，這種惡毒奸詐的心情就可恨可殺：實際上作奴才的已經是山窮水盡：只能借不能還，最後人家旣不肯借，自己也不敢開口；凡東西可以典賣的又早都去凈，不能保留到現在來救災解厄</p>
<p>結果誰也知道。時間和期限是再也不原諒人不肯爲人緩走一步的，海盜也和時間一樣的心狠。麥家的兒子等丢了命，麥大娘聽到兒子的結果，當時就哭死了去，一家四口只剩下了一老一小父女兩個！</p>
<p>麥林經過這塲傷心事，漁業也丢了，帶起女兒離開了舊居，靠着朋友帮忙走進水警局去當一名巡丁，因爲瑞思生長在海上，一天不見海，臉上就發愁，一天不划出小船在海裏鼓盪幾次，她就要害病，海風海浪就是她的空氣，沒有這些她怎樣能生活呢？若說那父親自己，他是望着那茫茫無涯的大海，守着那被豪浪摧折了的桅檣就掉眼淚。</p>
<p>他們在水警局躭了不久，就退了下來承受守護燈塔的職務。留島上一無居人，只有一個極大的塔矗立雲霄，塔頂是一所玻璃的空屋，裏面懸掛一個反射力極强的大燈，站在燈下朝海上望，那些怪石嶮戲的小島都淸淸楚楚，遠處記危險灘沙的紅標全在眼前，什麼鬼秘風險沒有一點能藏過去。點這大燈的人站在萬里光芒之下，親眼看見一隻隻載得得膨膨脹脹的大船得得的衝破白浪，長嘯而去，撇得那些陰謀險狠的礁島面面相覷，動彈不得，心裏非常之安慰，非常之快意的。</p>
<p>麥林艱苦半生，落得妻兒不保，想不到到了這傷心之極時候，海上生活還能給他一點値得留戀的意義，精神上鼓舞了許多。女兒瑞思年齡比先大了，更加懂事，除了跟父親划起燈塔下的小船去海上外自己會按照母親的老法子將米淘三次放在鍋裏加一倍多的水去蒸，近岸有魚蝦貝螺，她小心的撈起來照母親法子炒給父親下酒。小屋後面原有個小菜園，父親厭惡打魚，就把力氣用在種植靑菜羅卜上面。父親種菜時，瑞思就去井裏弔水，一桶一桶提來一點不費事。最後父親就會說够了，呌她站在旁邊歇歇。她會把手在腰裏一又，挺起胸說：「嗯，誰累！不過兩桶水不是！」於是她就拿起大木飄來替父澆水父親就要問：「瑞思？你今年幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「九歲。作什麽？」</p>
<p>「怕不怕？」</p>
<p>「怕什麼？」</p>
<p>「怕拐子拐你，怕大魚吃你，怕掉在海裏淹死。」</p>
<p>「嗯，拐子我拿槳打牠，大魚我拿網拖牠起來給爹喝酒；掉在海裏呀，嗯，海淹不死人，人會泅水，不是跑掉了麼？」</p>
<p>父親就抬起頭來朝她看一看說：</p>
<p>「大船上淹死幾千人哩，孩子。我們還救過人的，難道人家都不會泅水？」</p>
<p>瑞思憂愁起來，不作聲。父親又怕悶了她，就說：</p>
<p>「倒底怕了麽？」</p>
<p>瑞思搖搖頭，蹲下去，扳過父親的脖子臉對臉正色說道：</p>
<p>「爹！有我們守着燈，大船上還會淹死幾千人麽」？</p>
<p>爹說：「夜裏保得，日裏那能說？」</p>
<p>瑞思因爲這個心裏憂愁。無論黑夜白日聽見海上刮風就爬到自己對海的窗上去望，看遠處島上有不有遇難的船隻。有一天天還沒亮，瑞思在夢中忽然被大風雷雨驚醒，她猛的從床上跳起，跑到窗前去看，雖在烈風暴雷的黑暗之中，燈塔的光仍然火焰四射，照耀整個海面，遠遠見斷腸島邊似乎有斷桅破船，並且隱約有東西在那兒爬動，像人她轉身奔到她父親屋裏去，見她父親擁被坐在床上，面朝窗外看。閃電掠過他臉上，極其痛苦可怕。瑞思奔上去扯住父親說：</p>
<p>「爹！起來，去！救人去！」</p>
<p>麥林慢慢轉過臉來，摸着瑞思說：</p>
<p>「孩子，這風雨大得很呢，怕去不得。」</p>
<p>「不，不，一定要去！有我們守在塔上，不許大船上死人！他們爲什麼要死呢？不，救人去！救人去！說完她帶着鼻涕眼淚往外就跑。她父親立刻跳下來拉住她給她穿衣服，說：</p>
<p>「好，好孩子，我們就去。爲着幾千人，死了我們父子兩人也不要緊的！」一面說，一面把衣服穿好，帶上救生圈，收拾好船隻走下船去。天色已是漸亮，風浪並沒减少。父子兩人竭力支撑小船在掀騰的大浪中掙扎前進，有時被浪拋去半空中，有時落下來像掉在深谷裏，雨打浪澆，兩人的衣服頭髮全都濕淋淋的。終淤靠他們精熟的技術，把船穩的穩駕到斷腸島上，父親爬上岸去，瑞思將船泊在避風地方。島旁果然躺着一隻半沉的破船，露出半個烟筒，海上漂着一些雜亂東西和幾具浮屍，也被波浪，拋擲擊打着，毫無一點抵抗。一時答林從島上馱了一個人來，後面隨着許多人，個個鳩形鵠面，衣服破碎，濕濕的掛在身上，一齊上船，已經受傷的人都背了來讓牠們躺在船底，駕回留島去。瑞思不顧疲勞，趕緊把她父親的衣服搬出來四大家換，自己又抱了柴生火，讓大家烤烤衣服，把家裏的存糧作來給大家吃飽，傷了的，她也是一樣的伏侍，跳出跳進，說說笑笑，逗得那些遭了難，丢了親人的人們個個喜歡，喊她是他們的救星，是他們的喜神。</p>
<p>失事的那隻船據難客講，因爲汽鍋壞了，船不易行動，一遇風浪，更其失了駕馭，隨風打到島上，觸了大礁，全船粉碎，一船幾百人就只剩下了這次得救的十二個。十二條生命完全是瑞思父女打算犧牌了自己才救出來的。大家說來簡直又感激又傷心，不知怎樣報答。夜來了，麥林因受寒太過，病了。瑞思一個人安置了許多人歇宿的地方，自己又摸索着冒了大風大雨，爬上高塔，仍然點着了那一盞光芒萬丈救苦救難的大燈。</p>

<h3 id="c140">「一年來的總結算」 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 玉坡</p>
<p>文化建設十二月號</p>
<p>我們讀了今年（民國二十五年）文化建設月刊社所出版的文化建設月刊十二月號之後，便覺得。：該社從事於中國文化建設工作的熱心和成績，十分可嘉。這不是盲目的讚頌，我們只須看看該刊十二月號內的文章，便會相信無疑。</p>
<p>在全刊中，最重要的題材，當然推「一年來的總結算」一類的文章。共有六篇，的；（一）家禾的一年來的中日關係；（二）武育幹的一年來的中國國際貿易；（三）張素民的一年來的中國金融與財政；（四）許性初的一年來的內政與外交：（五）會建異的一年來的國際政治關係；（六）蕭艾的一年來平津的新聞紙。第一篇和第四篇，是屬於記載和報吿的文章；作者在叙述了眞實的史事之外，還指示了對該問題的正確的意見，藉此可以打掃外人對我國的誤見和謬論。第二和第三，是屬於研究和統計的文章，也能盡其本職。至於第六篇呢，可說是很稀有的調査材料；把平津一帶地方新聞紙的變遷，及其受强敵壓迫的情形分析得很淸楚，所以是極有意義的價値的工作。</p>
<p>總之，我們對於上述的六篇文章，認爲相當的滿意；尤其對於第一，和第六兩篇，可稱爲牠們中最好的成績，其他如；樊仲雲的綏遠戰事與國際現勢，李建芳的論中國共產黨與其最近的轉變，和李衡之的日本出版界印像記三篇，也可說是很値得一讀的文章·結論的來說，我們對於道一期文化建設月刊，還認爲滿意。但是，我們却希望着：該刊以後，在材料方面，還有擴充之必要：因爲文化建設的工作，除了政治，外交，經濟等問題之外，還有其他同等重要的問題，如：宗敎，藝術，科學等，這些事際上也是不能忽視的。</p>
<h3 id="c141">出版界與質年片 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 田之祺</p>
<p>賀年片是慶祝新年的一種禮物，牠的式樣文采很多，也和人類一樣，有表現兒童時代的，有表現少年時代的，有表現大人時代的，要之牠以多樣美雅淸新的姿態，來傳達人類間的友情。</p>
<p>因此每到新，出版界便有大量賀年片的產生，供給人們的需要。因爲人類的心是好新奇的，所以賀年片的花樣，一年新似一年，眞是千變百化，不可勝數。</p>
<p>目下市塲上所發售的賀年片，花樣雖多，但是仔細看起來，眞正好看的也不甚多，還有一種是從外國販買過來的賀年片，數量竟居大多數，片子上全是英文字的，自然一個漢字都沒有，雖然那種是預備給西洋人用的，但是所占的數量總是太多，同時許多同胞也以用此種式樣爲榮，所以西文的賀年片盛行於我國，今日已成爲普通的現象，實際平心說來，這也是一種自家文化的自侮政策，也就是次殖民地的人民的濃厚色彩。所以我們覺得賀年片雖是小事，但是我們也應該希望它能改造過來，製造出各種新的有意味的樣式，能充分的表現情俗風土的意識和國家民族的觀念，或是關於個人和團體生活的進修及新事物的認識等等，所以我以爲今後的出版界對於製作賀年片，在文字和圖景方面，應該多多注意下列各項：</p>
<p>（一）古今名人的格言——中國歷代先哲名賢的格言，對於處世立身之道，待人接物之方，指示極詳，很多有語語如金石者，可奉爲一生修養自進的標凖，尤宜選取其精長，印在賀年片上，作爲朋友間的五相規導引進，自然有很大的得益。</p>
<p>（二）古今著名人物的畫像和攝影——關於這方面的材料很多，如古今著名的賢哲，政治家·文學家·科學家·革命家·以及其他在歷史上有德行，有氣節，有功績，爲國民所信仰的人物，都可以作爲賀年片上製印之用，我們相信牠能給予人們有許多啟示和感奮的。</p>
<p>（三）歷史上的古蹟和文物——我國有數千年悠久的歷史，每一個朝代所留存的著名古蹟，如長城，天壇，明孝陵，頣和園，滕王閣，或是重要的文物等等，都是絕好的材料。</p>
<p>（四）各省市著名的風景及其特異的產物——這種材料更是多了，中國固不乏名山大川，三峽的星河，蜀道的天險，落日的黃河，片練似的長江，五嶽的巍峨黃山·匡廬。天台·雁蕩·峨嵋·天日諸山的勝景以及各處之著名產物，如森林，礦物，稻黍，菓樹，牛羊等等的製影，都是非常有趣味的，而且可於怡情悅神中得到一點常識。</p>
<p>（五）古今有名的書畫的製影——我國關於書畫的材料，眞多到不可勝數，可擇其名著如山水人物花卉虫鳥等作及古今人的法寄，攝影製印，此外又如現代的優良的木刻，油畫等，亦可選用，要之以能有美感撲人或能動人的姿態，都可印用的。</p>
<p>（六）現代國內偉大的新建築物的攝影——近年來我國的各項建築，都很有進步，而偉大的建築物如錢塘大鐵橋，上海之體育塲等等，均可攝印片上，使國民都能目覩其縮影，一方面對於國家建築上有許多欽仰，一方面也可藉此以爲神往，這自然是非常需要的。</p>
<p>以上隨便舉出數種，都足爲製印賀年片的材料，利用賀年片來宣揚自己國家的文化，在新年快樂的時候，灌輸一點優良的智識與觀感，這是誰都歡迎的，所以中國目下的出版尤是要負起這種平常爲一般所不注意的使命，這是我關於賀年片所感覺到一點小小的意見。</p>
<h3 id="c142">袁昌英的孔雀東南飛及其他 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 夔風</p>
<p>孔雀東南飛　（二）</p>
<p>至於人物性格的描寫，也許作者着重於她固有認識觀點，在那些過於堆砌的對話裏，反而晦澀了眞正的性格。仲卿的懦怯無能，焦母的孤僻易怒，是比較寫得顯見的，也可說是比較成功的。此外，最値得人同情的悲劇主角蘭芝，我們看不到她的一種深沉堅决的個性，頗是憾事。也許有人以爲深沉堅决形容個性，失於獨斷。但是，一個勇於受難，敢於犧牲的人，沒有深沉的態度，堅决的意志，絕不能爲愛情而忍受責打，絕不能爲愛情而視死如歸，雖說終究做了一個犧牲的弱女子，但她是有犧牲的代價的，這代價就是永久的精神的勝利。</p>
<p>Ｄ幾點提供討論的意見</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>關於人物，已在前一段裏略爲提出了一點意見，就是蘭芝的性格寫的太弱，失於晦澀。也許這是作者個人的理解有異同，當然，筆者不能强不同爲同。不過，這却是一個値得思索的意見。天下最聰明的人是瘋子，天下最勇敢的人是自殺者。人有勇氣做到自殺行爲最後决定，這勇氣他可以做許多別人所不能做的事物。自殺不是消極，更不是弱者的表現，蘭芝的結果，是自動地邀同伊卿同歸於盡，在臨死以前，她未嘗不是在希望中活着，所以她能忍受別人所忍受不了的痛苦。這並不是說，要將蘭芝描寫成一個精明果敢的女人，絕對不是。而是說，在蘭芝的動作中，言語裏，雖然她在流淚，雖然她在哀訴着命運，却應該有一股力，表達出她那獨特的性格來。這是劇作者寫作的時候所賦予的生命，現在我作爲意見提出，也許難於爲人理解的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>不知道作者的籍贯是什麽地方，可是能够斷言的，作者的「母語」應是長江上遊，兩湖的語音爲多。這種語音充滿在全劇台詞裏，是小小的一個缺點。這不是抹殺地方性，有時候爲了應付當前環境，會特別寫一種完全是土語的劇本，但，究屬例外。話劇的性質旣泛及全國，自以國語做台詞爲上。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>一個完整的劇本，最忌是獨白。劇作者是寗可多穿揷一點事件與人物，將要獨白的一段，曲折表達出來·獨白的缺點，一是拘泥演員表情，一是不能得到觀衆的同情。因爲，旣是戲，觀衆絕對討厭直達的情節，旣枯燥，又乏味。（未完）</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之四十一）</p>
<p>至民國二十二年春季，有嗬囒人J．L．Stellingweff及W．Stellingweff等，集資國幣十萬元開設國際紫氣電光公司（National　Neon　Lighbts　Co．Inc．U．S．A．），設廠於倍開爾路三十六號。二十三年四月復有陳其煒經營之百業貿易公司，創辦大來氝光燈行。然自二十二年後，滬市遭受世界不景氣浪潮之打擊，百業業蕭條。霓紅燈營業，直接受其影響，各公司營業，大不如前。國際紫氣電光公司以經營不善，於二十三年宣吿停業。福來勝，華德二廠亦已停止製造霓紅燈，專製燈泡。通明公司旋亦停止製造，改爲掮客性質·新光，美登，紫光等廠相繼改組·其他各較小廠家，倒閉者頗多。至此霓虹燈營業已現衰落之象矣！</p>
<p>考其寰落原因，由於不景氣之應響，固屬其最主要者，但其他原因亦多。蓋斯業範圍可大可小，其機件裝置，所費亦較其他各業爲少。故在該業興旺時代，各較大廠家之工人職員，稍有積蓄，輒各自設廠經營，於是小廠林立，跌價競爭。然霓紅燈爲較永久之用品，各商家之力能裝置者，咸已置備，外埠營業，又以資力短絀，無法開拓，遂呈供過於求之概，影響之下，小廠因此不支而倒閉，資力較大者亦因競爭而蒙巨大損失。</p>
<p>目前所存者，全市共十五家，計東方，麗安，大來，登美，新光，紫光，大同，光明，通明，大上海，麗華等。其中外商僅存麗安一家，餘均爲國人所營，以東方爲最大，堪執斯業之牛耳。</p>
<p>去年曾由東方發起，組織「上海市年紅業同業公會」，以冀劃一步驟，共圖發展。但卒因他故而未底於成。至今仍處於無組織之狀况下</p>
<p>三，原料及製造方院</p>
<p>霓紅燈普通分紅藍黃綠四色。其製造原料，以年紅氣玻璃管爲主。附屬原料有方棚，水銀鐵壳鐵架，紫銅，電綫等，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）年紅氣Neon　Gas，計分氫氣（NeoGnas），氬氣（Argon），海勒姆（Helju日）等三種。氫氣用於紅色，氬氣用於紅藍二色，海勒姆用於黃色。綠色則以二種氣體併製而成。此三種氣體，國人尙不能自製，本埠所用，均來自德美國，其中以美國貨居多。進口時固封於瓶內，本身係無色透明體，故視之一若無物。每瓶約一千CC，目前市價，氬氣每一千CC約五十七元三角，氬氣的五十元弱，海勒姆的五十元左右。雖略有漲跌，但所距尙微。本埠經營者有德孚洋行化學部（卽前億利登藥廠）科發藥房，雅利洋行等數家。年紅氣日人亦能自製，惟目前市上尙無日貨進口。</p>
<p>（二）玻璃管Glass　Tubing——玻璃管有組細數種，普通所用以三號管爲多，裝於櫉窗內者較細。其售價以磅計，普通每磅的二元（長約十尺）左右。本埠各玻璃廠家如三星，同興，中央等廠均能自製。各廠除東方現已自製外，餘大半均採用國貨</p>
<p>（三）電氣變壓器（Transloroes．）——俗稱方棚，大小以磅計。蓋以霓虹燈所用電流，較電燈爲高，故無論大小，必需裝置方棚，始能發光。其數量亦以磅計。本市各霓虹廣吿所用，最大爲一萬八千磅，最小僅四千磅。市上國貨外貨均有。外貨以韋司登脾爲最佳。本市百祿洋行，謙信機器公司，開能達有限公司，通用電氣公司，孔士洋行，西門子洋行等均有經售。亞洲電器公司，亞光製造廠，華生電器廠等較大工廠均能自製。日貨亦有進口，售價較廉，但據云較易損壞。方棚售價爲霓虹燈原料中之最勗貴者。警通小者數十元，大者　二三百元云。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c167">印犯处絞刑未死　中外資為譚助　印犯之妻言乃夫獲上帝之佑　英大使減刑之電訓尙未公布　西報述歷史上事件極饒趣味 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>大美晚報云、印人阿特瑪辛氏、於星期二日晨間、在華德路監獄中受絞刑時、繩忽中斷、雖於陸地之際腦部受震、但並不嚴重、可望復原、共人現仍臥捕房醫院中、報館訪員赴該翳院探詢阿氏知未絞死後作何感想者、均不能償願、因醫院中人僅誚阿氏現仍生存、其他不欲有所言也、大美晚報訪員、今晨（星期三日）往榆林路訪阿氏之婦、婦於談話時、欣喜幾不能自支、謂其夫之不死、全賴上帝保佑、自其夫判罪後、伊卽堅信上帝必佑善人、必不致死、訪員詢以絞繩中斷之故、婦答此由上帝之力斷之、其夫服務捕房時、每日輒在廟中禮拜四小時、故有此報也、該婦率其兒童現所寓之處、並非其家、阿氏夫婦原寓普陀路捕房附近、阿氏犯罪後、婦乃移寓友人之家、婦又謂當局不許伊往晤其夫、惟伊信其夫必能復原、因上帝將佑之故也、謂其夫今必能獲赦云、</p>
<p>此事發生後、滬人士均大爲詫異、駐滬英法總領事白理南爵士今晨會親赴華德路監獄澈查、蓋恐行刑者有溺職或舞弊情事也、聞今日下午尙擬再往、一部分人士、現頗憤行刑者玩忽職務、當局與獄吏現爲保護共人起見、均不願宜佈其姓氏、聞其人近吿長假、歸來未久、據監刑者稱、行刑之前、其人狀確漫不經心、又聞本年九月間、另一印人在華德路監獄</p>
<p>受絞刑時</p>
<p>行刑者名古定氏、猶爲副手、此次則爲正手云、此次所用之繩、前一夕會經試騐、覺甚堅靱適用、外間謠傳、該繩曾於夜間爲人換去、但此謠至今日午後猶不能徵實之、聞行刑時、僅有官員一小團臨塲監視、其中多人、直至行刑者大呼『天乎此眞慘事」時、始知</p>
<p>發生意外</p>
<p>阿氏身高四呎八吋許、重一百六十四磅、身量並不巨重、若謂繩不能勝之、則無是理也、阿氏於一九零四年生於印度、一九二四年加入公共租界警隊、平時服務、尙稱謹愼、英總領事白理南爵士以此事電陳北平英大使許閣森爵士後、聞已接到電訓、令將阿氏减刑、但今日下午</p>
<p>猶未公布</p>
<p>大美晚報之訪員一人、會就本埠法學家徵求關於此事之意見、彼等皆以爲按諸各國法律、均不應减刑或赦罪、如一次行刑不死、未始不可再刑之、普通人民因歷史上會有極少之人受絞未死、而獲赦罪、遂誤以爲受絞不死者、按律</p>
<p>當予赦免</p>
<p>今阿氏紋而未死、英國法律實未有不能再絞之明文、但此事將全聽英大使裁决、法律雖無不能再紋之明文、然减刑或赦罪、亦非絕無前例也、四五十年前、英國某處有一殺人犯受紋刑、絞架之機關、臨時忽不活動、致人不懸空、乃將機關修整、而仍不活動、接連三次皆然、至第四次、獄長宣佈、不願</p>
<p>凌虐生靈</p>
<p>乃將共人釋下、後改無期徒刑、終乃獲赦、其人繼爲倫敦之出版家、且以受紋三次未死、而馳名全國、臨終、頗有資產焉、往時英國醫學家得領刑斃之屍、以作醫學實騐、某次有醫曾將所領受紋之屍救活、迨當道知之、乃赦其人之罪、此爲一</p>
<p>有名故事</p>
<p>但從未經人微實也本埠意國當道謂意國今日絕無此種事件、因意國今日刑人、均予槍斃故也、惟在百年之前、會有一人受紋未死、而經赦罪、德國在七百年前封建時代、刑人以刃、行刑者頗不易爲、蓋若一刀不能斷罪犯之頸、則將因此獲咎而自喪其頭顱也、美國</p>
<p>刑人以電</p>
<p>一次不死、可再爲之、至死而後已、但往日肘紋刑時、會有一人因繩斷而獲救、後悉是人之判罪、乃屬寃枉、蓋眞犯曾出認罪也、中國會有一故事、某犯受刑時、請劊子手先斷其髮、以試刀之利否、劊子手如其言、該犯眷屬乃趨前大呼、謂犯人只有一刀之罪、今旣斷髮、不應再斷其首、縣官語塞、遂赦該犯、而置劊子手於法、</p>

<p>— 佳</p>
<p>又是一年了！一組新的日曆從我的手里已經撕到最後的一頁了，另一組新的日曆又將代替它的位子；而另一組日子也要從我的手里像現在的一樣撕到最後一天的，一年復一年，時光水一般地流去了，自己祇是悵然地覺得將要老了！</p>
<p>雖然在每個年頭的開始，總立下了許多願望和計劃，希望在新的一年中比較有一點竇貴的收穫，無論對於自己，對於社會，對於國家。但是生活太不能如意了，願望和計劃彷彿是鏡中之花，水中之月，到每年的今日，才轉過一口氣來把未完成的工作移到又一新年的賬上。</p>
<p>但是每次的失敗，是否願望和計畫太奢，或者是自己的不努力，有以致之。這里我不想替自己辯護，每一個青年都是好高騖遠，他們的願望，他們的計劃，或許在另一種目光看來簡直是夢想，永遠沒有成功的一天。這，我自然知道得很清楚。年靑人祇有成功，沒有失敗，成功了是我們的責任，失敗却是我們的恥辱！不過一塊警吿牌立在我們的前面—穩重！不許你動一動，於是無數的靑年徘徊在歧途上，無所適從。</p>
<p>然而年靑人又負着未來的國家主人翁的重任的，我們不但自己希望着，同時也被大希望着，但是沒有一個人把我們從歧路上救回來送上康莊大道，卽是偶然被我們發現了直上大道的路由，阻止我們前進的却又是我們自己人。你還想計劃嗎，還想立下願望嗎？又是一年的最後一天了！</p>
<p>「我願意我是個盲子！讓我在黑暗中模索！」我想起這兩句話來了。但是誰願意把自己的眼睛閉起來呢？看看前面，我又在立卞我的希望和計劃，在今天。</p>

<p>傍晚的市街。</p>
<p>肉鋪　沒有了血淋淋的猪頭，小攤前的菜葉留給小鷄啄食着的時候，在揪隘的市街上，傍晚的綫條是更其渾沌了。風那麼緊，冬天裏的日子黑得那麼早</p>
<p>冷靜的街上，敲着梆子的餛飩擔子走來了，灶肚裏的火光在風中擺曳着，一盞　　的小豆油燈搖曳着，旁邊站着幾個羞答答的小孩子，貪饞的眼光也搖曳着，一隻手指頭本能地放在嘴裏啃着，肚子裏不知怎的嘓地響了一聲。</p>
<p>賣餛飩的人像走江湖的人一樣，把鍋子裏熱騰騰的湯盛了上來，又慢吞吞地倒淮鍋裏去，像盛進碗裏去那　地挑撥着孩子們的食慾。他隔着一層蒸氣織成的霧，矜誇似地瞅着貪饞的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子們含羞似地跑開了，回到家裏則晚飯的小菜也是可口的。兩邊店家的門漸漸地關緊：不，不是人關了門，而是門關住人。</p>
<p>市街上是更其憂鬱了，而且還有賣夜食者在敲着梆子，疎落地測量着無底的夜。</p>

<p>— 聖路</p>
<p>橫着江面，有一艘破舊的渡船，沒有蓬，沒有槳，有一支細竹梢扦住在那里。對面半車棚下坐着一個瞌睡的老人，他就是撐渡船的舟子了。</p>
<p>他似乎沒有睡足的時候，一有空就坐在車輪上打瞌睡。或者是過渡的人太少吧？</p>
<p>四面是一片曠野，風在空中打着唿哨，不曉得從那一面吹來，吹向什麼方向去。老人只感到有一陣唿哨打着的時候，車棚的茅草縫里，就有像鋼針那樣尖銳的寒氣逼進來，他就微微移動了坐位，彷彿這樣可以和暖一點似的。那一雙羞澀的眼睛也跟着瞇開一條縫，看看對江有沒有一個喚渡的人。他又默算着袋里已經有了幾枚銅元，一個，二個，三個……算到十一個上沒有下文了。過渡是每人一枚銅元，那末今天有十一個人在江面上渡過了。但是不，他記得很淸楚，黃大娘的兒子生病，黃大娘早上渡江到鈸上去請醫生，她說袋里沒有零錢，回來時總算。於是他又對江的對岸瞥了一眼，他還有兩枚銅元的收入呵！</p>
<p>江面突然咆哮起來，它彷彿要吞噬了他的破舊的渡船似的。漸漸地浪潮翻上岸來，或許連這所唯一避避風雨的牛車棚也要被冲毁吧？但是老人馬上淸醒過來了，今天從東家溝到高鎭通行汽油船了，早上不是也拍拍拍的一陣，把江底的黃泥都翻了起來，江面染成了焦黃的一片，他的渡船就像斷了綫的風箏，在岸灘上顚來擺去，船頭上灑滿了污水。</p>
<p>他看着那隻汽油船從柬面開來，向西面駛去，那樣快，像箭一樣。</p>
<p>——假使，他想着，他有這樣一隻汽油船，擺一次渡恐怕祗要二分鐘，並且自己可以站在船尾上，不費一點氣力，像一個軍官什麼的。他不由地挺挺胸脯，他看見汽油船上那個穿中山裝的人就那末樣神氣地看着江的前面。</p>
<p>但是那是一個惡夢！汽油船過去了後，江面漸漸穩定了，黃色的泥漿也沉澱下去，江水又像鏡面那樣明朗，在太陽底下自己的破船停在那里，連細竹梢的影子都穩靜地躺在江面上。</p>
<p>這艘破渡船，常常使那些出一枚銅元過波一次的客人不滿，「爲什麼不做個蓬呢？」他們好像責怪老人不應該收了渡錢不使客人安全。下雨下雪天，要在渡口獃上半天，那艘渡船才有氣無力地搖攏來，有時老人睡得糢糊的時候，過渡的客人還要拉直嗓子喚醒他。到了船上，本來可以舒一口氣，坐一坐的，但是船里同樣積着水，而連蓬也沒有一個。他們看着老人披着一件破蓑衣也覺得他太舒服了。</p>
<p>「哼！你披了蓑衣，就讓大家雨里淋着嗎？爲什麼不做一個蓬？」</p>
<p>對於這樣的責問，老人祗有免强打了個哈哈「窮呢！想多積幾個渡錢，明</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>年一定做個蓬，明年一定做個蓬。」</p>
<p>但是他已經五十開外的人了。</p>
<p>對江有人喚渡了，他二才放下了那夢一樣的希望，站起身來。他知道一定是黃大娘從鎭上回來了。跳到船里，他使出年靑時的腕力來，沒有二篙子已經駛過半江。現在他看淸楚了，喚渡的人不是黃大娘，是一個陌生人。雖然覺得再等下去天將要黑了，不過這一枚銅元的生意倒底是多做的。</p>
<p>重回到牛車棚里，風似乎更緊了。黃大娘爲什麼沒有回來呢？</p>
<p>又有人喚着自己的名字，那聲音是從背後送來的，是黃大娘鄰居的阿根哥，他說黃大娘從鎮上坐汽油船回來了，她的渡錢明天送來。</p>
<p>天空更黑了，他眼前幾乎看不見什麼。明年一定做個蓬，這希望在他心底里重重地錘着。風吹着他頦下的鬚子，他咳嗽起來了。</p>

<p>喧傳已久的非常影片「壯志凌雲」今日起在本埠金城大戲院公映了，這是新華公司在這個非常時期貢獻給全國同胞的一部偉大作品。故事的取材是在中國的某一個邊省裏，農民爲了生存而作壯烈的抵抗的戰史，這個題材在今日的中國無疑是極其需要的。</p>
<p>演出方面，導演吳永剛拿他過去的成就足以保證諸位滿意，而主演人員陣容的整齊，如金燄，王人美，陳娟娟，王次龍，韓蘭根，田方黎明健，章志直等這幾位紅人的演技，把這部片子充滿活躍的情調，更是值得吿訴諸位的地方。該院爲調劑擁擠計，元旦日起至三日爲止，每天上午十時加映一塲。又新華公司煞費心機冒險攝得之「綏遠前綫新聞」亦同時上映。</p>

<p>性戚明星梅蕙絲新作</p>
<p>梅蕙絲可以說是銀幕上的一個獨一無二的尤物，他不但善於演戲，並且還會編劇本，寫對白，我們如果僅把「風騷」「浪漫」的眼光來看她，那是不够的。像過去的「風鹿奇女」等片，和今天起在國泰大戲院開映的「銀星醜史「（Go　West　Young　Man）一片，都是她自己所寫的劇木。她在「銀星醜史」中，祖任主角，扮演一位風流女明星，她覺得都市中的男子，沒有一個當意者，後來忽於無意中在鄉間遇着一個孔武有力的機師，她就用種種方法去引誘他，可惜他是一個不解風情的男子，弄得梅蕙絲神魂飄蕩。她那極端奔放的情緒，忸怩媚蕩的姿態，把一個浪漫女人的心理遭遇，描摹盡致，這樣的好戲，恐怕祇有梅蕙絲才寫得出和演得出吧。</p>

<p>民族危機日益深刻的現在，組織民衆最有效的武器的戲劇，雖然受着很嚴重的外力的壓迫，新近也居然很有些蓬蓬勃勃的樣子，這自然不能不說是一種好現象。</p>
<p>最近在許多話劇團體先後成立、準備公演中，醞釀了許久的「戲劇工作社」，也宣告成立了。該社主要的負責人，是鳳子，吳鐵翼等從前復日劇社的榦部，贊助人則包括了歐陽予倩，應雲衛，趙景深，阿英，金性堯……等諸氏，基木演員多敎是復旦劇社的社員，都是頗爲覜衆所熟悉的。</p>
<p>「戲劇工作社」第一次公演的劇本，已經决定爲曹禺先生新作，轟動一時的四幕劇「日出」，導演一席，原來打算在歐陽予倩和應雲衛二氏請一位担任，現在應氏因爲事忙，决定由歐陽氏担任導演，日來正在積極排練中，大概不出一個月左右，常可在舞台上與觀衆相見了。</p>
<p>「日出」乃曹禺今年完成的力作，發表以後，劇壇公認是比曹氏的「雷雨」更爲成功之作，「雷雨」最初在上海公演，卽由鳳子女士及復旦劇社的演員所演出，導演者也是歐陽予倩先生，現在山「雷雨」的全班人馬來演「日出」，駕輕就熟，將來的哄動，大概也不靴預卜了吧。</p>

In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, he visited Gao again and exchanged documents resolving the Beihai case, and concluded discussions on the resolution of the case, expressing mutual gratitude. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Chengdu and Beihai cases in the Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Embassy authorities, after months of negotiation, have now reached a complete resolution. At 4:30 PM on the 30th, Gao Zongwu, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, brought Minister Zhang's note to the Japanese Embassy, while Suma, First Secretary of the embassy, brought Ambassador Kawagoe's reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. The two parties formally exchanged documents to conclude the cases. Suma is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 30th to spend the New Year. It is said that after the New Year, discussions on the Shanghai and Hankou cases will continue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially released the exchanged documents for the two cases on the 30th as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Chengdu Incident</p>
<p>Minister Zhang's Note: Respectfully, regarding the incident on August 24th this year in which four Japanese nationals encountered an accident in Chengdu, resulting in two injuries and two deaths, I, as Minister, on behalf of the government, express my sincere apology to your government. At the time of the incident, the local authorities made efforts to suppress and rescue, but the Provincial Capital Garrison Commander Jiang Shangpu and the Public Security Bureau Chief Fan Chongshi were negligent in their defense. The Chinese government has dismissed these two officials. In addition, Cao Wukun, Battalion Commander of the Garrison Command, Liu Yaogu, Company Commander, Deng Jiexiong, Section Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Sun Yuejun, Squad Leader, Kang Zhen, Branch Chief, etc., have all been given respective punishments. The ringleaders of this incident, Liu Chengxian and Su Debo, have been executed. Other perpetrators, Cen Qun, Wang Shuqing, Peng Dingzhai, Liu Ziyun, etc., have also been given respective prison sentences. The Chinese government will provide the bereaved families of the deceased, Watanabe Senzaburo and Fukagawa Keiji, with actual loss expenses and appropriate condolence money, and will provide the injured, Tanaka Takeo and Seto Hisashi, with actual medical expenses and actual loss expenses, the amounts of which will be notified separately. As this incident has been handled in accordance with the above measures, the Chinese government considers it to be resolved. I hereby inform Your Excellency Ambassador for your consideration and reply. I, as Minister, extend my highest regards to Your Excellency Kawagoe Shigeru, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Empire of Japan to the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe's Reply: Respectfully, I have received Your Excellency Minister's note dated December 30th of this year, stating (the text is the same as the note above, omitted) (omitted in the middle) etc., which I have read with understanding. The Chinese government's payment to the bereaved families of the deceased and various expenses to the injured, totaling 98,887.10 Chinese national currency, has also been received by this embassy. The Japanese government now considers this incident to be resolved. I hereby inform Your Excellency Minister for your consideration and reply. I, as Ambassador, extend my highest regards to Your Excellency Zhang Qun, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(B) Beihai Incident</p>
<p>Minister Zhang's Note: Respectfully, regarding the incident on September 3rd this year in which Japanese merchant Nakano Junzo encountered an accident in Beihai, Guangdong, I, as Minister, on behalf of the government, express my sincere apology to your government. At that time, the situation in Beihai was unique, and due to the suddenness of the incident, although the relevant authorities took appropriate measures, the protection was not thorough. However, Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Guozhen, who were actually guarding the area at the time, had already been dismissed, and Chen Zhen, the Chief of the Beihai Public Security Bureau, had also left his post, making it impossible to impose further punishments. The perpetrators of this incident have been given respective punishments according to the severity of their offenses. The Chinese government will provide the bereaved family of the Japanese merchant Nakano Junzo with 30,000 yuan as condolence money. As this incident has been handled in accordance with the above measures, the Chinese government considers it to be resolved. I hereby inform Your Excellency Ambassador for your consideration and reply. I, as Minister, extend my highest regards to Your Excellency Kawagoe Shigeru, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Empire of Japan to the Republic of China.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission believes that with the Xi'an Incident resolved, martial law in all areas under martial law, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and Zhenjiang, should be lifted immediately. In addition to separate telegrams to inform them, a special report was submitted to the National Government for review and record. The National Government issued an order to the commission on the 30th, approving the record. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chengdu) When the Chengdu case occurred, Fan Chongshi, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, made efforts to suppress the situation and personally rescued the Japanese national Tanaka Takeo. However, due to the chaotic situation at the time, an unfortunate incident occurred. The provincial government believes that Fan's prevention was still inadequate and has recently issued an order for his dismissal, and Zhou Zhizong has been temporarily appointed to take over the bureau's affairs.

<h3 id="e3">Chairman Chiang Repeatedly and Sincerely Requested to Resign; Difficult to Approve Given the Current Difficult Times; Central Government Unanimously Resolved to Retain Him; Granted One Month's Leave for Recuperation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 32nd Standing Committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th. The Standing Committee members present were Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Yu Youren, Lin Sen, Wu Jingheng, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Ji, Zeng Yangfu, Zhou Fohai, Zhou Qigang, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Fang Zhi, etc., with Zou Lu as the chairman. The resolutions were as follows: (1) Regarding Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's repeated request to resign from his concurrent positions as President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, it was resolved that Comrade Chiang sincerely expressed his desire to resign from his concurrent positions. Yesterday, the Central Committee unanimously resolved to earnestly retain him. Now he has submitted his resignation again, with sincere words. The Central Committee deeply knows that Comrade Chiang has been bearing heavy responsibilities for the country and the people for many years, and his mind and body are exhausted, different from ordinary people. However, considering that Comrade Chiang is admired by both China and foreign countries and is the protector of the nation, and given the current difficult times, it is difficult to approve his resignation. Regarding his repeated request to resign, it was unanimously resolved to retain him and grant him one month's leave for recuperation. (2) The celebration of the founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1937, will be chaired and reported by Committee Member Yu Youren. Visit to the Mausoleum at 8:00 AM on the morning of that day, and a memorial service will be held at 9:00 AM. (3) Next Monday's memorial week at the Central Party Headquarters will be chaired and reported by Committee Member Zou. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang submitted his resignation to the Central Government and the National Government due to the Xi'an Incident, requesting to resign from his concurrent positions. The Central Government and the National Government separately retained him. Chairman Chiang submitted his resignation again on the 30th. In addition to the Central Committee's unanimous resolution at its morning meeting on the 30th to retain him and grant him one month's leave for recuperation, the National Government also issued an order to Chairman Chiang in the afternoon of the 30th, earnestly retaining him and granting him one month's leave. The original order stated: "Your report has been received. The President of the Yuan and Chairman is highly respected and relied upon by the people. At this time of difficulty, it is hoped that he will prioritize the overall situation, shoulder the heavy responsibility, lead the people, and strive for the early completion of the great cause of national revival. It is said that his mind and body are exhausted, which is deeply concerning. One month's leave should be granted for recuperation. After the leave, he should immediately return to duty to promote peace and comfort public opinion. This is what is earnestly hoped for. This order." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang submitted another report to the Central Committee on the 29th, firmly stating his previous request, earnestly requesting to resign from his concurrent positions as President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. The Central Standing Committee resolved on the 30th that it was difficult to approve his request and granted him one month's leave for recuperation. The text of his repeated resignation is recorded below: "Respectfully submitting this report, yesterday, I, Zhongzheng, believed that because of the Xi'an Incident, as the superior officer, I should bear the primary punishment. I submitted a sincere report, earnestly requesting permission to be relieved of my concurrent positions and to be severely punished to uphold the law and discipline. All my requests came from sincerity, but they were not approved and were instead comforted with a generous retention. Upon hearing this, I was apprehensive and could not sleep peacefully. I believe that the fate of the nation depends on discipline and the hearts of the people are moved by integrity. I, Zhongzheng, have repeatedly taught the military and civilians with the aim of being responsible and abiding by discipline. Now that I have caused this major incident due to my negligence and dereliction of duty, if I evade responsibility and remain in my position, how can I demonstrate credibility to the people and lead my subordinates? From the perspective of responsibility, I, Zhongzheng, must immediately step down and await punishment. Moreover, I, Zhongzheng, have dedicated myself to the Party and the country and should do my best. I dare not cherish my life, but I have been bearing too heavy a burden for years, with internal worries and external physical damage. My mind and body are exhausted, and my wisdom is declining. With this exhausted body, if I were to continue to shoulder heavy responsibilities, I would inevitably make mistakes, accumulate faults, and fail to help with the difficulties, thus betraying expectations. I know that the Central Committee can assign tasks according to ability and will never force a sick and exhausted body to bear the heavy responsibility of delaying and making mistakes. Therefore, I again express my sincerity and firmly state my previous request, earnestly requesting permission to resign from my concurrent positions as President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and to be punished. I respectfully request your approval, and I await your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission."

The association immediately sent all the poor smokers to the police department for temporary accommodation and hired doctors to treat them, as a show of relief.

<h3 id="e53">Theory of Political Change in Japan (Part 1) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>In Japan, even a cabinet change is called a "political change."</p>
<p>Since Hirota's cabinet was formed, the "theory of political change" could be seen every month. But, until today, the Hirota cabinet still exists. However, today, there are more people divining the fate of the Hirota cabinet. For example: the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun of December 19th published "The Fate of the Cabinet"; Kaizo Shin Nian Go has "The Fate of the Hirota Cabinet"; and the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of December 21st published "The Anti-Government Attitude of Political Parties," etc. Of course, there is no eternally unchanging regime, nor is there an eternally unchanging cabinet. Political change in Japan and the downfall of the Hirota cabinet cannot escape this fate.</p>
<p>The main question determining the fate of the Hirota cabinet is: Has the Hirota cabinet completed the political tasks it should have completed? If it has not been completed, can it be completed in the future? The Hirota cabinet has two tasks in domestic affairs: first, the so-called "renewal of all government affairs"; second, the passage of the massive budget. It also has two tasks in foreign affairs: first, negotiations with China; second, negotiations with Russia. It can also be said that in domestic affairs it is "strengthening wartime control"; in foreign affairs it is "strengthening the mainland policy."</p>
<p>Now, it can be generally said that only the massive budget has been passed in the cabinet meeting. As for the "renewal of all government affairs," the military has submitted an "administrative organization reform plan," but it has not been implemented to this day. Speaking of Hirota's diplomacy, the Privy Council, various political parties, and general Japanese public opinion all believe it has failed.</p>
<p>However, the unprecedented budget that has been passed by the cabinet is now becoming a focus of attack. Only the military and Japan's military-industrial capitalists are happy with this budget; the majority of the Japanese people are only frowning. The basis for the inflated budget is largely built on tax increases. This time, the tax increase is a staggering 600 million yuan. Not to mention other taxes, let's take a small example: cigarettes are a daily necessity for the general public. Among Japanese cigarettes, there is a brand called "Golden Rat," which costs seven cents per box of ten cigarettes. This is almost what small and medium-sized merchants and laborers like to smoke. According to the Asahi Shimbun's estimate, as a result of the tax increase, this kind of cigarette will rise to eight cents a box, and the government can increase its revenue by 30 million yuan per year. The increase in this kind of burden is extremely easy for the general public to feel. As for the laborers, due to the tax increase, prices rise, which is essentially the same as reducing wages. This is truly "the moon is curved, shining on the nine continents, some families are happy, others are sad." This kind of work (tax increase) completed by the Hirota cabinet is indeed one of the main reasons why the Hirota cabinet has not collapsed, but it is also one of the main reasons why the general public opposes it. The various political parties of the bourgeoisie do not really want to oppose the government's large tax increase, but are only using it as a tool for political struggle, hoping to attack the Hirota cabinet in the parliament after the New Year.</p>

<p>— Liang Dong</p>
<p>In Wuchuan, everyone suffered from the cold. I couldn't stand the cold in the middle of the night, so I got up alone and listened to the sentry horn outside. The east slowly revealed the dawn, and the scene was very magnificent.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 13th, we continued north. The climate was even colder. But the situation north of Wuchuan seemed different again. Looking as far as the eye could see, it was a desolate prairie desert, without a single tree or a single river. Heaven and earth seemed particularly close. The car was driving on the prairie, and there was no so-called road. As a result, we went sixty miles in the wrong direction to a place called Wulanhua Cave, which was already after 2 pm. In the distance, we could see the enemy's bomb-destroyed earth pits and horse corpses. Wulanhua Cave was also an important place, and our soldiers were building bunkers and other fortifications there. We stretched our backs in their garrison and continued north.</p>
<p>At 4 pm, many wild goats ran along with us for a while. Bailingmiao was in sight, so everyone excitedly sang again. We had been running around in the Han Chinese area, where we had not seen any people for a whole day. Suddenly, we saw the majestic temples with palaces and mountains and rivers surrounding them. Many important mountain ridges were guarded by our soldiers carrying guns and live ammunition. After negotiations by representatives of the provincial government, we drove straight to the temple. As soon as we arrived at the temple gate, we saw the ground covered with flying strips of paper, yellow and white, which were said to be the scriptures recited by the lamas. To the east of the temple, there were many Mongolian yurts, which I heard were formerly inhabited by Mongol banner nobles, but now they have all run away. There are also Mongolian yurts inside the temple, because the Mongols are not used to living in tiled houses.</p>
<p>After we got out of the car, we were diligently received by a Deputy Adjutant Meng, who took care of our accommodation and dinner, and said repeatedly, "You have worked hard. This place is very bitter and the accommodation is uncomfortable." Their hospitality really made us feel a bit ashamed. Our group was divided and lived in the 5th Squad of the 8th Company. When we moved our luggage in, they hurriedly cleaned up the bunk for us. The room was heated by burning dried cow and horse dung. After a while, Deputy Adjutant Zhou came to talk. From his conversation, we could know that they had indeed used the determination and perseverance of death to win this recovery of Bailingmiao. He said that because the team started from Wuchuan, they were all frozen and hungry enough when they reached Erfenzi. The soldiers were determined to take down Bailingmiao to get a full stomach, because if they retreated near the temple, they would either freeze to death or starve to death. The team captured Bailingmiao by rushing forward in hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Dinner was a large pot of noodles. The cook happily said that there were also vegetables sent by the regiment headquarters. It turned out that it was only bean chili sauce sent by the Baotou Comfort Group. A bowl of bean chili sauce was very rare, which shows the hardship of their lives. But we ate very happily, because the noodles were all enemy's property. Later, the regiment headquarters also brought a pot of wine, saying that it was also a special product of the enemy's, and invited us to taste the spoils of victory.</p>
<p>After dinner, we all went to the regiment headquarters to see Brigade Commander Sun Lanfeng and Chief of Staff Yuan Qingrong. The representatives gave comfort speeches, and Chief of Staff Yuan Qingrong gave detailed thanks on behalf of Brigade Commander Sun. Every word was filled with enthusiasm for resisting the enemy. Especially his precise analysis of the current international situation and the significance of the enemy's management in Manchuria and Mongolia made us admire him, admire our current armed comrades for being able to understand politics and economics so clearly. He said that this capture of Bailingmiao was a victory for the national people's unanimous demand to resist the enemy. The reason why we want to recover Bailingmiao is to protect the throat of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia. The most valuable thing we got from the enemy this time was not the millions of bags of noodles and millions of bullets reported in the newspapers, but all the secret plans about the enemy's invasion of Inner Mongolia, such as military maps of Inner Mongolia. We still don't have such detailed maps with a reduced scale of 1/10,000. If we want to survey and map them ourselves, not only will the time not be counted, but the cost alone will be estimated at more than 30 million. Because the reporter is in charge of some Mongolian banner education work in Suiyuan, I asked about the relationship with the Mongolian banners after De Wang's defection. There is a small school in Bailingmiao, which mainly teaches in Japanese and Mongolian. There used to be a Mongolian military officer school specializing in training Mongolian soldiers, all of which were planned by someone from a certain country.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 14th, we went up the mountain to see the fortifications. There were still many corpses in the valley, frozen as stiff as iron, which was extremely tragic. The most difficult to look at were the corpses of two officers from a certain country, whose faces were smeared with blood and flesh. We pulled them out to a bright place and took a few photos. Near one of the corpses, I also picked up a cloth arm patch with the words "Second Class Soldier Gu'er Zabu, 4th Squad, 2nd Platoon, 21st Regiment, 7th Division, 2nd Cavalry Army, Mongolian Army" written on it.</p>
<p>At the top of the pass, there were piles of machine gun shells. It is said that our army had fought seventeen deadly battles there. Now our army's defensive fortifications are very solid, but the situation of taking turns guarding day and night is too bitter. Especially in the middle of the night, every two companies have a Mongolian yurt at the foot of the mountain. Although the shifts are changed every hour, the scene of patrolling on the icy and freezing mountain with guns and live ammunition is very solemn and difficult.</p>
<p>After going down the mountain and returning to the temple, we visited Mr. Shabazi, the representative of Prince Yun of Darhan Banner, north of the temple. Many Mongolian lamas were packing up the broken relics with gloomy faces, like dogs of the bereaved family. They couldn't speak Chinese, and they moved very slowly. The crimson robes were dirtier than wiping cloths, and the high-topped boots seemed extremely inconvenient. It is said that the lamas who returned for the first time secretly went back to inform the enemy, and even destroyed our communication lines at night, causing a lot of damage to our army. Therefore, those who return to the temple now must be secured by someone.</p>
<p>At 10:30 am, we bid farewell to Bailingmiao and boarded the car to return. Before leaving, we sang and shouted loud slogans:</p>
<p>"Long live the anti-Japanese soldiers! Long live Bailingmiao! Long live the 35th Army! Long live the Chinese nation! Unite all the people of the country!"</p>
<p>When we returned to Guihua and Suiyuan, it was already evening. When we crossed the south of the mountain, we felt that the climate of Suiyuan was as warm as spring. Indeed, the return from comforting Bailingmiao brought us a lot of national fighting spirit and spring. (December 24th in Guihua and Suiyuan.)</p>

<h3 id="e55">This Year's Review <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Should</p>
<p>The year of the 25th year of the Republic of China is coming to its last day. The evolution of national affairs this year has had a great significance in the process of national rejuvenation. Today we are here to briefly explore it.</p>
<p>During this year, our country was rescued from great difficulties. Although the Suiyuan War has not yet ended, after the heroic resistance of the frontline soldiers and the enthusiastic assistance of the national people in the past few months, even if the enemy is stubborn, they will eventually lose their courage. The successive recovery of Bailingmiao and Damaozi, the bases of the puppet bandits, not only strengthened our self-confidence, but also showed the great power of the Chinese nation to the world. Under the current situation, the international forces behind the puppet bandits should thoroughly understand that our national people have resolved to defend the country with all their strength.</p>
<p>The victory of the Suiyuan War is indeed the dawn of China's rejuvenation. However, in the past year, there are also things that are worthy of our infinite celebration, that is, the peaceful resolution of the Liangguang unrest and the Xi'an Incident. These two major events, under the circumstances of such serious foreign troubles, had the potential to shake the foundation of the country. However, the conspiracy of instigation only played a temporary role, and the great spirit of the central authorities for the country and the people, and the urgent demands of the national people for peace and unification, finally made these two unfortunate events achieve a peaceful and proper resolution in a very short period of time. As a result, the hearts of the people across the country have become more united under the leadership of the central government, and the foundation of China's unification has become more solid.</p>
<p>The degree of cultural and economic aspects of China's provinces is uneven, and unification is very difficult. The resolution of the two major unfortunate events this year undoubtedly overcame many difficulties in the future of unification. However, the progress of the unification situation is mostly due to economic construction. Although the country has experienced major troubles this year, the social finance and international foreign exchange have remained stable. This is obviously the effectiveness of the legal currency policy. In addition, in terms of transportation, the north-south main line Guangdong-Hankou Railway was completed this year, and the number of highways and air routes was expanded by thousands of kilometers. In terms of agriculture, the facilities of cooperatives and warehouses have also greatly developed. The achievements of this economic construction are of course an important factor in promoting the true unification of China.</p>
<p>Today's China is steadily moving towards the goal of true unification. Anyone who wants to stop this trend will be doomed to destruction under the unanimous curse of our entire nation. The anxiety of the national people during Chairman Chiang's plight and the celebration after his return to Beijing are the most obvious manifestations of the desire for unification. Because today's world regards him as a symbol of a unified China.</p>
<p>At this time of the year's renewal, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly expressed his intention to retire, which is not allowed by the current situation in our country. Yesterday, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Standing Committee resolved to earnestly retain him. The public opinion of the people is of course the same. We have always known that Chairman Chiang is brave in taking responsibility, and we expect that he will always comply with the demands of the whole people in his comings and goings.</p>

<p>Vatican The Pope's condition suddenly deteriorated tonight. His left leg is swollen and shows signs of blood clots. Doctors believe that the condition is dangerous. The Pope must now rest quietly. The Pope's left leg often has severe pain. Today, he suffered from neuritis, so the pain was even worse. The attending physician, Milani, performed electrotherapy, but it was ineffective. Mr. Mi is now paying close attention to the Pope's heart, but the heart is still good at present. Fortunately, the Pope has not had asthma today, only a slight symptom in the early morning, so the symptoms of heart deficiency have been reduced. According to officials, the Pope's condition has not changed, only due to leg pain and lack of sleep, the resistance has been reduced. The atmosphere here is full of pessimism and depression. The authorities have ordered various church organizations to hold special prayers for the Pope, but to avoid panic, they have not instructed the churches to take similar actions. It is heard that although the Pope's condition has worsened, he still met with the Minister of Religious Affairs this morning to deal with routine government affairs. (Reuters telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Vatican According to today, the blood clot in the Pope's leg has dissipated, and the pain has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the deep concern of the general public has been slightly relieved. It is said that if the Pope's condition continues to improve, he will be able to get out of bed in about two months. At present, the Pope's left leg still cannot be laid flat, but some people advocate setting up a specially made chair so that the patient will not be confined to bed for a long time.

<p>(Paris) In view of the Pope's serious illness, newspapers here urgently sent many reporters to the Vatican to collect news today. (National telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Hungarian Capital Archduke Frederick of the Habsburg royal family, the uncle of the Spanish deposed King Alfonso and the commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Allied Forces during the Great War, passed away here today at the age of eighty. It is reported that Mr. Fei joined the army at the age of fifteen and was promoted to the rank of general at the age of thirty-eight in 1894. Sixteen years later, he was appointed as the commander-in-chief. After the end of the Great War, Mr. Fei lived in Switzerland. It was not until 1918, after General Hothai overthrew the communist government of Hungary, that he returned to his motherland and settled in Megjarofoly. Mr. Fei originally had a lot of inherited land properties, but they were all confiscated. Mr. Fei married Countess Qiao Teke in 1878 and had nine children. Now only one son remains, Archduke Albert.

<p>(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently held talks with Hasse, the German Ambassador to Italy, and Lima, the Portuguese Minister, to discuss how to reply to the notes submitted by Britain and France some time ago, which advised Germany, Portugal, and Italy not to send any more volunteer soldiers to Spain to help in the war. Regarding the situation of the talks, semi-official figures did not disclose anything, only saying that the issue raised by the British and French notes was the same as the non-intervention method proposed by France in August of this year. Political figures said that the current situation is very different from that of August. If they accept the proposals of Britain and France now, it is tantamount to falling into the trap of communism, which Germany, Portugal, and Italy do not want to do. As for Italian public opinion, they have all re-emphasized the anti-communism touted by Italy and Germany, firmly believing that communism must be stopped, and saying that it is surprising that Britain and France jointly submitted the above-mentioned notes at a time when Britain and Italy are about to sign a gentleman's agreement to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean. The reason is that this policy of Britain will change the status quo in Spain and make it profitable for the Red Army (i.e., the government army). (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the British and French governments submitted notes to Germany, Italy, and Portugal yesterday, advising those countries not to send any more volunteer soldiers to Spain, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano conducted talks with German Ambassador Hasse and Portuguese Minister Lima yesterday to prepare a reply. Until this morning, he consulted with Hasse again. In addition, Ciano signed a trade and shipping treaty between Italy and Turkey with Turkish Ambassador Huaxi. (Havas telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A famous Italian reporter, Xue Niuleiti, recently published an article in the "Stanba" newspaper, severely criticizing the notes submitted by Britain and France, roughly saying that the Republican government in Valencia, Spain, and the Catalan Autonomous Government only have the support of tens of thousands of communists in the country. If the dispatch of volunteer soldiers from various countries to Spain is stopped, the result will only be beneficial to those governments. "The Spanish war is still spreading. The Soviet Union is the principal offender, and the French government cannot escape the responsibility of complicity. Is the intention of the note submitted by the French government to assist its 'Spanish comrades'?" Referring to the attitude adopted by Britain, Xue Niuleiti believes that it is ambiguous and unclear, and said that peace in Spain and its territorial integrity can only be guaranteed after General Franco wins. Why can't Britain see this? Finally, referring to the Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement that Britain and Italy should sign, he said, "The term 'status quo in the Mediterranean' has many meanings and should not be limited to the so-called Italian desire. If a Bolshevik country is formed in Spain and is controlled by the Soviet Union, the status quo in the Mediterranean will be destroyed, and it should be prevented at any cost. As for the British-Italian Gentleman's Agreement, it will probably not be announced until early January next year." (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Britain and France recently submitted notes to Germany, Portugal, Italy, and Russia, advising those countries not to send any more volunteer soldiers to Spain to help in the war. The Soviet government recently sent a reply to Britain and France, accepting this method in principle. The preamble of the reply roughly said that the dispatch of a large number of volunteer soldiers to Spain by various countries is sufficient to endanger peace, as stated in the notes of Britain and France. However, the Spanish Nationalist army initially only had Moroccan indigenous troops. Later, a large number of Germans joined the battle. These people are not volunteer soldiers in nature. This behavior of Germany is actually aiding the rebels in order to achieve their goal of overthrowing the legitimate democratic government. In order to maintain peace, the Soviet Union is now prepared to sign an agreement with Germany, Portugal, and Italy, but it is attached to the following four conditions:</p>
<p>(1) This agreement should be subject to effective supervision; (2) This agreement should take effect as soon as it is signed, without waiting for the implementation of the supervision system; (3) Before the implementation of the supervision system, each signatory country should send personnel to supervise the departure and arrival of volunteer soldiers and publish reports to the public; (4) This agreement must be signed as soon as possible to prevent certain countries from taking the opportunity to continue sending a large number of volunteer soldiers to Spain before signing.

<p>(London) The current US Neutrality Act only applies to foreign wars and not to domestic wars. Therefore, the US government cannot prohibit the export of aircraft to Spain. This is understood by British officials, but they believe that Britain and France have made many efforts to maintain peace in order to promote the implementation of the non-intervention agreement. Other countries should not hinder this. Officials are also afraid that the shipment of US aircraft to Spain will have two effects. One is that Germany, Italy, and other countries may use this as an excuse to refuse to accept the supervision method of the non-intervention agreement. The second is that even if Germany, Italy, and other countries accept the supervision method, when the US aircraft arrive in Spain, the international supervisors may come out to stop it. In this case, conflicts may occur between the London Adjustment Committee and the US government. Regarding this matter, Sir Monsuy, Assistant Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with Mr. Aderton, Counselor of the US Embassy, at 4 pm for discussions. (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt spoke with a group of reporters today and expressed his disapproval of American businesses transporting aircraft to Spain. The President stated that although this is legal, it is unpatriotic. He also stated that the existing Neutrality Act should be amended to give the president the power to take action. Adding the words "civil unrest" to the clauses would broaden its scope. At the same time, Senator Nye, chairman of the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee, also stated that he would request the State Department to announce who is supplying the Weimar Company with these semi-new and old engines and airplanes for investigation. Senator Pittman further stated that he is prepared to introduce an amendment to the Neutrality Act in Congress to include civil wars. If Congress passes this proposal, then because the Weimar Company's engines and airplanes will not be shipped for two months, the State Department may be able to revoke the licenses issued before shipment. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Deputy Undersecretary of State Moore expressed regret over the lack of laws preventing the export of aircraft to Spain, and said that the human instinct for profit will unfortunately continue to exist in times of war. Moore also stated that the government currently has no other way to deal with the aforementioned trade other than issuing permits, and that the public should understand this fact. Senator Pittman also stated that exporting aircraft to Spain is a clear violation of the spirit and intent of the Neutrality Act. He intends to introduce a bill immediately when Congress reconvenes on January 6th to prohibit the export of all munitions and bullets to Spain. Pittman also expressed his hope that the proposed bill can be quickly passed by Congress, so that the aircraft and automobiles worth $2,777,000 that Spain has ordered can be cancelled in time, as this batch of goods will not be shipped for two months. This new bill will also expand the scope of the existing Neutrality Act to include all large-scale civil wars. According to a spokesperson for an aircraft brokerage firm that recently obtained a license to export to Spain, all aircraft prepared for export to Spain are old commercial aircraft and have not been modified for combat.

<p>(Moscow) The All-Union Population Census to be held on January 6th next year will show the great economic and social changes in the Soviet Union since the general census of 1926. This census will show a sharp increase in the urban population. At the end of 1926, the urban population of the Soviet Union accounted for only 18% of the total. It is now estimated to be about 30%. The increase in the urban population in the past nine years is more than double the increase in the urban population in Russia in the sixty years before the revolution. Many new cities that sprang up due to the industrialization plan did not exist at the time of the 1926 census. For example, Magnitogorsk now has 200,000 people, and Karaganda has 120,000 people. The population of Sverdlovsk has increased two and a half times in recent years, and Lyubinsk has increased five times.

<p>The widow of the late Sir Houston, a famous British shipowner, passed away today, leaving an estate worth over £5 million. Lady Houston donated a great deal of money to public welfare undertakings. In 1933, she funded the Mount Everest flight expedition. In 1931, she donated £100,000 for the Schneider Trophy air race. Last year, she was willing to donate £200,000 to supplement London's air defense funds, but it was rejected by the British government. Lady Houston strongly advocated women's suffrage and was very concerned about the happiness of women. She donated funds to establish a sanatorium for nurses who retired due to overwork during the European War, and maintained it independently for two years. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in a conversation with reporters today, strongly stated that bad habits such as employing child labor, excessively long working hours, and excessively low wages should be stopped immediately. The President believes that one-tenth of the industry is competing unfairly by taking advantage of loopholes, so measures must be taken to prohibit it. Since the National Industrial Recovery Act expired, there have been no restrictions on working hours and wages in the industry. If any action is taken in the future, it should be implemented universally throughout the country, and individual states cannot provide relief alone. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e89">After the Opening of Sino-Japanese Air Routes in North China, It Is No Different from Exclusive Military Flights for the Japanese. The Kwantung Army Plans to Expand Air Routes Again. Traitor Yin Again Occupies Xinhe Salt Flats <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: It has been half a month since the opening of Sino-Japanese air routes in North China on November 18. In these forty-five days, the aviation business operated under the name of the Huitong Company has shown no improvement. The four routes originally planned with Tianjin as the central hub - Tianjin-Dalian, Tianjin-Jinzhou, Tianjin-Chengde, and Tianjin-Zhangjiakou - have seen very few passengers on the latter three routes, despite the specified routes. Recently, they have become irregular routes. Even on the Tianjin-Dalian route, most of the passengers are Japanese, mostly army and navy personnel, with very few Chinese. Because the pseudo-Manchukuo does not allow Chinese to enter and exit freely, those with business in that area are unwilling to risk going by air and are often restricted. The irregular flights on the Tianjin-Chengde, Tianjin-Jinzhou, and Tianjin-Zhangjiakou routes are mostly due to the lack of ordinary passengers. Therefore, Huitong is nominally a privately-run airline, but in reality, it is still an air squadron under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Higuchi of the Japanese military department. Zhang Yunrong, the chairman of the company, has been claiming illness and has returned to Peiping since the opening of the routes. He has not returned to Tianjin even after nearly fifty days. The reason for this is nothing more than the difficulty of handling affairs, and the measures taken by the counterpart are not fully compliant with the various regulations concluded in the agreement. A few days ago, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, O, announced that between February and March of next year, the Manchuria Aviation Company and the Huitong Company will jointly connect the Tianjin-Changchun and Tianjin-Harbin air routes, with Jinzhou, Dalian, and Chengde as exchange stations. There will be three round trips per week. These two routes will then form an air route network between North China and Manchuria. If realized, transportation will become more convenient. The air route connecting Dalian with Japan will also be held between April and May, with Fukuoka as the central exchange station. Departing in the morning and arriving in the evening, it will take only ten hours to travel from Tokyo to Tianjin, or from Tianjin to Tokyo. The aircraft currently operating between Tianjin and Dalian is only one Ford-style eight-seat three-engine aircraft. Huitong Company has ordered one A.T. type eight-seat super-speed all-metal aircraft from the Nakajima Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Osaka, which will be completed in February of next year. It will be used to operate the Tianjin-Dalian section and for connecting flights to Fukuoka. The aircraft will be able to fly from Tianjin to Dalian in one hour, shortening the time by about one hour compared to the current aircraft. The aircraft will have smoking and washing facilities, making it more modern than the current types of aircraft. The company's capital was originally set at 5.4 million yuan. In addition to the 2.7 million yuan that has already been raised, the remaining amount is being raised to expand operations and purchase aircraft. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council should be responsible for 1.35 million yuan, which will be raised by the Hebei Provincial Bank. There has been no contact with our postal authorities regarding the attachment of mail, but in fact, the company has been collecting and sending it on its own, and parcels are also transported at will. The only difference is that it has not publicly announced the collection and sending of mail. It is said that when the various joint air routes are completed in April of next year, the company will officially operate its own postal air service. The Tanggu salt flats under the jurisdiction of the Changlu Salt Transport Administration were occupied by the Japanese military headquarters in October of this year and designated as military land. After many negotiations, the stakes and nets have not been removed. There are various rumors about what the land will be used for. This matter has not been resolved. Yesterday, we received a report from the salt flat residents of Xinhe, stating that the pseudo-government of eastern Hebei has notified the salt flats that it intends to occupy the flats on New Year's Day, and will sell the salt produced there itself. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance as quickly as possible to find a way to negotiate and stop it, the Changlu Salt Transport Administration has also cancelled the 100,000 yuan of subsidies per month, which had been privately agreed with the pseudo-regime since this spring, with the condition that the salt flats would not be disturbed, to show its resistance. Based on all of this, it is predictable that this matter will not be easily resolved. As for the pseudo-government's takeover of the salt flats, it is rumored to be at the instigation of a certain party, because that party urgently needs Changlu salt to produce chemical salt. This year, 70,000 tons were transported there. Next year, it is planned to purchase 250,000 tons. Fearing that it would affect the people's food supply, we did not agree. The party then instigated the pseudo-government to forcibly take over, in order to facilitate the purchase of goods. (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">A Spy from the Puppet Army Was Captured in Linhe, Western Sui Province. According to His Confession, He Worked in Zhang HaiPeng's Army. There Were More Than Forty Other Traitors Who Came with Him. <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Linhe Correspondence: Linhe is located on the western border of Sui Province, at the junction of Sui, Ningxia, and western Mongolia. It is a thoroughfare between Baotou and Ningxia and the gateway to the western border of Sui Province. It has always been a place where bandits and traitors haunt. In order to prevent villains from mixing in, the military and political authorities here have long tightened security in western Sui Province. Communication and delivery networks and anti-communist reserve teams have been organized in various villages to be on strict guard in order to ensure safety. On the 20th of this month, the anti-communist standing team of the fourth district of Linhe captured a spy from the puppet army at the junction of Balian West Set and Alxa Banner. He was taken to the county government for interrogation on the same day. According to the prisoner's confession, his name is Liu Jinfa, 49 years old, from Lingyuan County, Rehe. He is currently a spy in the Zhang HaiPeng puppet army. He was sent to western Sui Province under the guise of buying fur to investigate the strength and weakness of the rear of the national army. He arrived here at the beginning of this month and has been lurking in the countryside for nearly twenty days. There are more than forty traitors who came to the Hetao area with him. According to the confession, the Linhe county government immediately took the prisoner into strict custody and informed the local garrison to arrest the remaining fugitives and bring them to justice. It is also reported that, according to the prisoner's confession, they only earn 30 cents a day for serving as traitors in the puppet army. (December 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Beijing Seriously Cleans Up Opium and Drugs: New Regulations for Drug Prohibition and Punishment Determined to Be Implemented on New Year's Day; Mayor Ma Reports on Beijing's Drug Prohibition Progress <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing dispatch: The municipal government held a memorial service for the Premier at 8 a.m. on the 28th. All staff members attended. After Mayor Ma, as chairman, led the ceremony, he delivered a report on the spot. He began by saying, "In the past two weeks, people across the country and in various countries around the world have expressed their grief and concern over the ordeal of Chairman Chiang. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang's great personality inspired Zhang, Yang and others to thoroughly repent. This unprecedented incident was eliminated invisibly. Now the leader has safely returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday. The whole country is celebrating, a grand occasion unprecedented since the founding of the Republic. Although our losses in this incident are not small, the gains are also extremely great. This incident proves that the entire country, regardless of whether they were usually dissatisfied with the leader, the Party, or the government, could unanimously work hard to rescue the leader from danger, support the government, and support the Party. This is sufficient proof that the country has a very solid foundation, and the nation has an extremely cohesive unity. In the future, anyone who wants to harm the Party, the country, or the leader will undoubtedly fail. However, while we are celebrating the leader's escape from danger, we should not forget the seriousness of the national crisis. We should work together to 'strive forward to break through the national crisis and revive the nation.'" Mayor Ma continued, "The year 25 is coming to an end, and the year 26 is about to begin. The government's newly formulated regulations for drug prohibition, opium prohibition, and punishment will be strictly enforced in a few days. Therefore, I specially report this, hoping that all citizens will pay special attention. The government has spared no effort in publicizing and promoting drug and opium prohibition for the past three to four years. Our city first established a drug rehabilitation hospital in the 23rd year. The number of beds gradually increased from 150 to 2,270. By the end of January of the 24th year, as the number of opium addicts gradually decreased, the drug rehabilitation hospital was merged into one location at Chaotian Palace. After June of this year, due to special circumstances, the drug rehabilitation hospital was moved to Chaoku Street and Chuanban Lane successively, with a total of 750 beds. As for the expenditures, from the establishment on February 9th of the 23rd year to October of this year, a total of more than 178,600 yuan was spent. A total of 22,728 opium addicts have been discharged after successful rehabilitation. There are still more than 700 opium addicts currently undergoing rehabilitation. However, there are still many citizens in the city who smoke opium and have not undergone rehabilitation. Nanjing is an absolutely opium-free area, and it is still like this. The situation in other places can be imagined. The reason for this is that the general public regards government policies as mere formalities. At the same time, they are afraid of difficulties and procrastinate, leading to this situation. The harm of opium and drugs is known to everyone and does not need to be repeated. Now, in addition to using military force and economic aggression, the enemy is using the most vicious and cruel poisoning policy, smuggling large quantities of heroin, morphine, and other drugs to lure our people into addiction in order to realize their ambition to destroy our country and exterminate our race. This kind of poisoning policy is more harmful than any other aggressive policy. Once the people are poisoned, their bodies and minds will undergo various changes. Neurologically, there are symptoms such as selfishness, forgetfulness, dishonesty, lying, and deception. Physically, there are symptoms such as constipation, heart weakness, and slow breathing. Its toxicity can also be passed on to future generations, causing endless harm. Now, countries around the world are striving for eugenics. How can we not thoroughly eliminate this kind of opium and drugs that weaken the country and the race in order to eliminate the obstacles to strong countries and strong races? As the saying goes, there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart. The enemy's poisoning policy is precisely intended to kill our hearts. Therefore, in order to save the country and revive the nation, the government has decided to strictly enforce drug and opium prohibition. From New Year's Day of the 26th year, new regulations for drug prohibition, opium prohibition, and punishment will be implemented. Here are the most important articles for reporting: (1) Article 8 of the Drug Prohibition and Punishment Regulations: From the 26th year of the Republic of China, those who commit the crimes in Articles 3 to 7 of these regulations (i.e., manufacturing, transporting, selling, or using drugs, or administering morphine injections to others) shall be sentenced to death. (2) Article 5 of the Opium Prohibition and Punishment Regulations: Those who transport, sell, or possess opium with the intention of selling it shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than five years, and may also be fined not more than 3,000 yuan. If the quantity is more than 500 taels, the sentence shall be death. Those who transport, sell, or possess poppy seeds with the intention of selling them shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than ten years, and may also be fined not more than 1,000 yuan. Those who import opium or poppy seeds from foreign countries shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than ten years, and may also be fined not more than 5,000 yuan. The same applies to those who export them to foreign countries. Article 6: Those who set up places with the intention of making profits, providing opium and smoking paraphernalia for people to smoke, shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than five years, and may also be fined not more than 3,000 yuan. Article 8: Those who smoke opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than two years, and may also be fined not more than 300 yuan. Addicts shall also be required to go to the hospital for compulsory rehabilitation within a time limit. Those who voluntarily surrender for rehabilitation and commit the aforementioned crime again shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than three years, and may also be fined not more than 500 yuan. Addicts shall still be required to go to the hospital for compulsory rehabilitation within a time limit. Those who commit the first crime again after compulsory rehabilitation shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than ten years, and may also be fined not more than 1,000 yuan. Addicts shall still be required to go to the hospital for compulsory rehabilitation within a time limit. Those who commit the crime for the third time shall be sentenced to death. School teachers, staff, and students who commit any of the above three crimes shall be punished according to the highest penalty for each item. There are only a few days left before New Year's Day of the 26th year. The critical moment of life and death is imminent. I hope that all those who smoke opium will wake up as soon as possible and voluntarily go to the drug rehabilitation hospital to request rehabilitation. You should know that the government will keep its word. Do not test the law with your own bodies and regret it too late. Finally, I hope that if any of my colleagues in this government smoke opium, they should inspect each other and quit as soon as possible. They should take on the responsibility of leadership for the citizens and persuade them at any time and anywhere in order to save themselves and others. We cannot bear to punish without teaching. In these few days, we should mobilize the entire staff to publicize to the citizens as much as possible so that opium and drugs can be completely eliminated in the shortest possible time. From now on, if we turn back and rely on our own efforts for regeneration, it will not be difficult for the country and the nation to achieve the goal of prosperity and revival in three to five years," he said.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Xiamen Inn Association Asks for the Abolition of the Water Police Subsidy Fee, Originally a Temporary Exaction, but the Provincial Government Regards It as a Local Tax <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen dispatch: The Second Detachment of the Fujian Water Police stationed in Xiamen, due to insufficient funds this summer, decided with the Chamber of Commerce, innkeepers, and shipping companies through the detachment leader Zhang Xijie that overseas Chinese going abroad would pay an additional 5 jiao (0.5 yuan) of national currency as a subsidy fee for the water police when purchasing tickets. The inns would collect the fee on behalf of the water police and hand it over to the shipping companies, who would then transfer it to the Second Detachment of the Water Police. This has been implemented since September of this year. Each month, 5,000 to 6,000 overseas Chinese leave Xiamen. Calculated at 5 jiao per person, the monthly income is approximately between 2,500 and 3,000 yuan. Recently, the provincial government issued an order that all donations be collected by the Xiamen Municipal Government Finance Bureau. The Finance Bureau ordered the shipping companies and inns to directly hand over the subsidy fee they collected to the Finance Bureau. However, the shipping companies and inns believe that the subsidy fee was originally of a temporary nature and should not be considered a regular tax, placing a long-term burden on overseas Chinese going abroad. Therefore, they refused to collect the fee on behalf of the Finance Bureau. The Finance Bureau then sent personnel accompanied by water and land police to intercept overseas Chinese boarding ships at the docks and coasts to collect the fee. Although the overseas Chinese all paid the fee, they had many complaints. On the 27th, the Inn Association submitted a petition to the Finance Bureau, requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial government to clearly abolish the subsidy fee. The main points of the petition are: "(1) When the Second Detachment of the Water Police launched the subsidy fee, it was originally for the purpose of building electric boats and consolidating coastal defense, and it was a temporary measure. (2) It was agreed to temporarily collect the fee for six months and then abolish it. (3) Since December 1st, the fee has been directly collected by your bureau, becoming a local tax. (4) Most overseas Chinese going abroad are laborers, and they have to borrow money in every possible way for travel expenses. They have no way to pay this subsidy fee and have no doubt about it. Because they thought it was temporary, they reluctantly obeyed the order. Now that it has become a local tax, it is inevitable that it will go against the intention of caring for overseas Chinese. Please forward the situation to the provincial government and approve the clear abolition of the subsidy fee in order to comply with the feelings of the overseas Chinese." It has been investigated that the subsidy fee is actually a kind of exorbitant tax. Most of the Chinese who go abroad are laborers who are unemployed in China. Their travel expenses are usually borrowed. The burdens of boat tickets, passports, vaccinations, etc. are already huge. Moreover, the establishment of the subsidy fee was only at the intention of the Second Detachment of the Water Police. The permission of the shipping companies and inns was only obtained through the water police team's announcement that if there were no objections from overseas Chinese and relevant agencies and organizations within two weeks, the shipping companies and inns would collect the fee from passengers going abroad. There is no legal or rational basis for this. Moreover, the so-called "no objection from overseas Chinese" means that those who are going abroad have not yet started their journey, so how can they be qualified to object? Therefore, it is actually an illegal exorbitant tax that adds a burden to overseas Chinese going abroad. (December 30th)</p>

After explaining the reasons to the province, requesting that the free status be continued, the Finance and Construction Departments subsequently instructed that the exemption be granted. However, the needs of each organization should be verified and the number of vehicles limited. If the free licenses are found to be transferred and used on privately owned bicycles, they will be revoked immediately and not reissued, and a fine of ten times the donation amount will be imposed. In addition, post offices, telegraph offices, and other guilds will be required to pay donations and obtain licenses from New Year's Day of the 26th year.</p>

<p>The Donghua Sports Association, in order to celebrate the safe return of leader Chiang Kai-shek to Beijing, specifically contacted the Capital Lizhi Society and scheduled to go to Beijing on New Year's Day to perform a congratulatory performance with the Capital Mixed Team. The next day, they will compete against Jinling University. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the association originally planned to depart on the Capital Express train leaving at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. However, the result of ticket purchases was that the train, because it is still in its inaugural run, all seats are assigned by number and have been fully booked. Therefore, they had to change to the Shanghai-Beijing Express train leaving at 8:35 AM from Shanghai. However, the arrival time in Beijing is already 2:35 PM. Therefore, the competition time has been telegraphed to the Lizhi Society to change to 3:30 PM. In order to discuss the matters related to going to Beijing, the association has scheduled a meeting for all team members at 5:00 PM this afternoon at the association's clubhouse on Jisi Feier Road. All Donghua Reserve Team members who were selected in the list announced yesterday must attend. If anyone is unable to attend due to unavoidable reasons, they must also notify Mr. Ding Zhaocheng by telephone at 20756 between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM in order to determine the number of people going to Beijing. As for the friendly match between the association and the Beining Railway team, although Beining had a prior agreement to play against the French Chamber of Commerce, the French Chamber of Commerce was unable to play tomorrow, so this match is still scheduled for New Year's Day (tomorrow) at 3:00 PM at the Shen Garden. The association also plans to invite Fudan athletes Liu Zuru and Liu Zuxiu to temporarily play for Donghua and participate in the match against Beining. Therefore, both Liu are also requested to attend today's meeting. The Beining team left Tianjin the evening before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. They will be staying at the New Asia Hotel.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association Women's League had three games scheduled yesterday. However, because Jida played against Jizhong in a school match, only two games were played in Shen Garden. (1) Dongya vs. Jiangjiang: Dongya was obviously superior in strength, but the Jiangjiang ladies tried their best to resist. In the first quarter, they once took the lead 9-8. However, Dongya's momentum suddenly increased and became smooth sailing, winning 48-17. They completed this season's schedule with five wins in five games and won the championship. The Xie Jin Association presented a silver shield for encouragement. (2) Liangliang vs. Shangzhong: One side is a sports specialist, and Shangzhong is not a real opponent. However, after several games, Shangzhong's skills have greatly improved. Sun Defang, their forward, is very brave. Therefore, even under strong pressure, she can still play well. As a result, Liangliang won 35-21. The scores of the two games are listed below.</p>

<p>Chih-Chih Avenges Loss, Defeats Shanghai College</p>
<p>Two Western Youth basketball games were held last night. In the university division, Chih-Chih faced Shanghai College again. Chih-Chih had carelessly lost in the first round, indirectly costing them the university division championship. Last night, eager for revenge, the team members were cautious. Shanghai College proved to be inferior, and in a one-sided game, Chih-Chih overwhelmingly won with a score of 68 to 36. The score for the first half was 34 to 17, a difference of half. In the second game, in the independent division, Xin-Tong played against the Hornets. Xin-Tong, in the previous round, had also been too careless, nearly stung by the Hornets. Last night, they dared not be careless, and ultimately, with superior skill, overwhelmingly won with a score of 44 to 17. The score for the first half was 23 to 11. Tonight is New Year's Eve, and tomorrow night is New Year's Day 1937, so games are suspended as usual, and will resume on the 2nd, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Prohibits Borrowing for Construction and Additions <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To Avoid Irreparable Consequences</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructed all counties that the construction and additions of county-run schools should be investigated for necessity by the county education bureau director or section chief, as well as the supervisor and educational committee. The situation should be reported to the bureau meeting or county government meeting (in counties without a bureau), taking into account the actual state of the county's education funds, making overall arrangements, and preparing various attachments and requests for funds to be submitted to the province for approval and allocation of funds. If public funds are insufficient and the school must raise all or part of the funds itself, construction and procurement must wait until the funds to be raised have been collected, and the approved public funds must be received before proceeding with construction and procurement. As for the construction and additions of private schools, the funds required should be the responsibility of the school board to raise themselves. It is absolutely not permissible to disregard the economic situation, borrow heavily, and be burdened by interest, falling into a state of being unable to maintain operations. However, it is often found in county fund request cases that county school principals and private school board members and principals arbitrarily borrow heavily for construction and additions, making it impossible to remedy. The principal and interest on the debt gradually increase, leading to an unmanageable situation. County schools then request the bureau and county to issue funds for maintenance, while private schools request to be taken over by the county to transfer the debt. Such trends directly harm local education funds and indirectly affect the stability of educational undertakings. If strict prohibition is not enforced, the consequences will be dire. From now on, county and private school principals or private school board members who disregard their economic capabilities and have no proper remedies, and arbitrarily borrow for construction and additions, should be instructed to manage the matter themselves, and the education bureau or county government may not subsequently request funds or allocate subsidies on their behalf. Private schools with such debts will not be taken over by the county until the school board has properly settled the matter. In addition to separate orders, you are to comply and instruct your subordinate bureaus, schools, and social education organizations to take note. This order.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the bond market trend was firmly upward, and buying interest was strong. Due to vigorous pulling by major players, both B-Class and A-Class Consolidated Bonds exceeded their highest prices since trading began. However, in the later market, due to a gradual profit-taking by long positions, there was a slight pullback. Nevertheless, the strength of the market did not seem to diminish. Today is the last day of the year, and the bond market is expected to be in a better state as the financial sector settles accounts. The course of yesterday's trading: in the morning, selling of No. 35 bonds was very active, and E-Class bonds fell by 5 to 20 cents.

<p>The standard yarn and cotton market, due to handling delivery procedures at the end of this month, traditionally suspended meetings. However, spot yarn merchants still came to the market to do business. Customer spot yarn transactions were normal, but they had a strong interest in next year's futures yarn, with very healthy appetites. It was found that a total of 1,552 bales of futures and spot yarn were traded by various groups throughout the day. Japanese yarn prices rose by 2, 3, or 4 yuan, and other prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e123">1,700 Bales of Cotton Arrive <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<p>Jinji brand yarn for December futures began trading on July 3rd of this year at a price of 205 yuan and 80 cents. At that time, estimated reductions in US cotton acreage and rising market prices, coupled with rumors of the issuance of circulating notes in this port, made people even more confident and prices rose step by step, reaching a peak of nearly 220 yuan. Subsequently, due to favorable weather conditions in our country and a bumper cotton harvest, cotton prices fell, and selling became more active. The financial sector turned from long to short positions, breaking through the 200 yuan mark. Later, in the autumn, with bountiful harvests of agricultural products nationwide and booming cloth trading, various groups actively came to purchase for the autumn sales season. Factories had no spot yarn supply, and first bought up all 30,000 bales of yarn stored in yarn and cloth warehouses. The booming yarn sales set a new record for the past five years. More recently, factory labor strikes and severe Qingdao strikes made short positions even more apprehensive, and market prices soared, reaching a maximum of 268 yuan, the highest price since 1918. The final closing price was 263 yuan, a sharp increase of 57 yuan and 20 cents from the starting price. As a result, 17,750 bales remained to be delivered, an increase of 15,200 bales compared to last month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 263 yuan, an increase of 19 yuan compared to last month. The delivered goods consisted of 20s, 16s, and 10s yarn, totaling 7,700 bales, of which 10s coarse yarn accounted for 3,000 bales. It is reported that China Cotton Corporation exclusively accepted the goods, with Yong'an Factory delivering the most. The brokerage firm license numbers and quantities of the receiving and delivering parties are recorded below.</p>
<p>Standard cotton for December futures began trading on July 3rd of this year at a price of 41 yuan and 35 cents. At that time, favorable news from US cotton, a greater-than-expected reduction in cotton acreage, and a rise of 60 points per pound caused excitement in the market. In addition, the large rise in the yarn market led to a recovery in the closely related cotton market, and buying momentum increased again. Market prices rose step by step to around 44 yuan. Subsequently, on August 20th, the first report from the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association indicated that this year's rainfall in our country was uniform, coupled with the high cotton prices of the previous year, which expanded cotton planting areas and benefited from favorable rainfall, resulting in a national bumper harvest estimated at over 16 million dan. The market shook, and prices turned downstream to above 37 yuan. Until recently, brisk yarn sales led to continuous advances in market prices, and the cotton market followed suit, rising again to 44 yuan and 30 cents. The final closing price was 42 yuan and 90 cents, an increase of 1 yuan and 55 cents from the starting price. As a result, 64,300 dan remained to be delivered, an increase of 37,000 dan compared to last month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 42 yuan and 50 cents, an increase of 2 yuan and 10 cents compared to last month. The delivered goods included Tongzhou cotton, Huoji cotton, and Shashi cotton. The brokerage firm license numbers and quantities are recorded below.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the government will sell 3 million bales below the spot price</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with sluggish demand from foreign merchants and brokers. Long positions were unwinding, and prices for each month ranged from up one point per pound to down three points per pound. Selling interest was not strong, with only limit orders being sold. Afterwards, when market prices returned to 12.5 cents, buying interest was hampered, and the industry waited for developments in the overseas situation, fearing that cotton purchased with loans after the New Year would be sold off. Therefore, they adopted a cautious attitude. However, during the price decline, the industry still bought in. Finally, according to unofficial news, the government would sell 3 million bales at 25 points below the spot price, and selling pressure increased again. As a result, spot prices fell by 16 points, and futures prices fell by 16 to 25 points. UK cotton spot prices rose by one point, and futures prices fell by three or four points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by European exporters and brokers, but later short covering was overturned by arbitrage selling, resulting in increases of half a rupee for Pingor, and decreases of 1.25 rupees for Umla, and 0.75 rupees for Bai Luo Xi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 29th).</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 30th was 227.5 rupees for Bai Luo Xi, 207.25 rupees for Aomura, and 175.75 rupees for Pingor, all down 1.75 rupees.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Particularly Active in Futures; White Goods and Fine Cloth for February and March Are Already Sold Out <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to be firm. Spot transactions were mostly speculative. Customer spot purchases were slightly quieter due to the year-end closing. After Japanese factories opened large numbers of futures positions, customer interest remained strong. White goods and fine cloth for February and March have already been sold out, and prices rose by 5 to 10 cents. Due to month-end lending in the spot market, a small amount of cheap goods were released into the market, and prices increased by 2.5 to 5 cents (per piece). The spot market atmosphere was weaker than the futures market. Color goods, Dongpi Juxiancun straight satin, 200 cases were opened by Qingdao Gang yesterday, price (per yard) 31.5 cents. Futures for February and March of Sijunzi Serge also soared (per yard) by one cent. Spot prices also rose by 5 to 7.5 li. Fine twill from this factory sold briskly, and prices also rose, increasing (per piece) by 5 cents from the previous day. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, and patterned goods were all stable. Blue cloth and colored twill were also raised in price by (per piece) one dime due to grey cloth. Velvet was falling in price due to off-season demand. The highest price for 15-pound Gengyu brand was previously 13.9 yuan, but has now been reduced to 12.8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Grain: Thick Japonica Rice is Popular in Local Purchases <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 50 sources of goods from various groups, totaling 11,000 to 12,000 shi. Thin indica rice accounted for over 40 sources. Although the Tianjin, Qingyan, and other groups continued to handle 5,000+ packages of the product, the market had limited change. Thick Japonica rice was, conversely, scarce and local sales were rather robust, leading to an increase in price of 10 cents. Du Yang pointed rice remained similar to previous values, and the path to Yin Yuan rice broaded, resulting in a rise of almost 10 cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources of goods from various He Xia routes were sparse, approximately 20 sources. Local sales of white japonica rice, upper-middle tier goods, continued to be secured, but scattered sales and higher-priced transactions were quiet. The market situation for high-tier japonica rice was stable, with mid-tier goods in particular being tight. Conversely, white japonica rice was weak, with prices being down 3 to 5 cents. Early thin indica rice sales were average and prices were stable. Yang Du Bu pointed rice prices were fixed, and white yuan scattered sales were ongoing, with prices rising about 10 cents.

<p>Yesterday, the market for Customer Indica rice turned robust, and market prices showed a turning point. Though it was the end of the Gregorian calendar year, due to reduced arrivals over the past few days and goods being held en route, yesterday, there were even hoarders asking about purchasing. Both the Northern and Guangdong groups had over 1,000 packages in transactions, and Henan also had some volume. Local purchasing interest was high, and general market sales opened above 10,000, so prices rose by about 10 cents. Full-day sales opened with 5,040 packages of Jiangxi rice, 3,300 packages of Hunan rice, 2,075 packages of Wental Jiaxing rice. In addition, 500 packages of small, twisted rice from the local market were sold as aged goods. The production cost of small twisted rice must be 13 or 14 yuan, which is difficult to coordinate. Yesterday's market opened at 11.1 yuan, a price that was about 1 yuan higher than the price sold the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Special Report: Production, Sales, and Manufacturing of Qihong Tea (Part 3) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>From the above table, the market price of Qihong tea is highest in May and June, as it is the time when new tea enters the market, and exporters compete to purchase it. After that, prices show a downward trend. Distinguishing by year, the highest price was in 1931, and the lowest was in 1928, which is due to the influence of fluctuating silver prices. The average price for each year was also highest in 1931 and lowest in 1929, but even in that year, the price per dan was above 100 yuan. This refers specifically to top-grade Qihong, so it is insufficient to represent the general monthly wholesale market price of Qihong.</p>
<p>The following is a table of the average price of Qihong per market dan, compiled based on the monthly sales prices published in the China Bank Monthly over the past five years:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Table of Average Market Prices of Qihong Tea in the Last Five Years (Unit: Yuan per Picul) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The trend of Qihong tea market price fluctuations in the above table is similar to that recorded in the Shanghai Commodity Prices Monthly. The difference is that the Bank of China compiles its data based on the total monthly transaction values, while the Commodity Prices Monthly uses the market price on the 15th of each month as the standard for compilation and only includes top-grade Qihong tea, excluding medium and lower-grade teas. This is the difference between the two tables. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e139">Macris <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>— "It doesn't matter if we father and daughter die for the sake of thousands of people." —</p>
<p>Along the coast of eastern Fujian, countless massive rocks and reefs stand in the water. Sometimes they emerge to form clusters of small islands, and sometimes they submerge beneath the surface. If navigators are not careful, they will collide with them and shatter their ships into pieces. At the same time, these emergent islands often become lairs for pirates, who take advantage of the opportunity to plunder. Fujian is located at the crucial intersection of the East and South China Seas, and its winds and waves are especially treacherous. Things may be calm usually, but as soon as clouds gather, a fierce and dark storm can erupt immediately, overturning ships, or else smashing them against the reefs. Naturally, these dangers are always less during the day and can be guarded against, because there are always warning signs on the reefs, and experienced navigators can also read the clouds and wind. But at night, night is the bane of navigators on the Fujian seas!</p>
<p>The most dangerous place of all is a cluster of reef islands outside Zheyang Island!</p>
<p>Nature prepares hardships for mankind. Does that mean mankind should diminish their ambition to advance? No. In order to conquer it, mankind invented the use of lighthouses. The method is very simple: build a very tall tower on a larger island near the shore. At the top of the tower, burn a very large and bright light that can illuminate the entire sea surface for dozens or hundreds of miles. This gives navigators the same kind of bright security as daylight even when traveling in this dangerous area, so they won't encounter unexpected disasters. Because lighthouses are so important, the lighthouse keepers are also very important. He must have a simple family with no worries, he must be of a considerable age, and especially he must be physically strong and have no vices. Because of this, 50-year-old Merlin became the keeper of the lighthouse on an island outside Zheyang Island. He had no relatives except for his nine-year-old daughter, Macris. The father and daughter lived on that isolated island, accompanying the lonely lighthouse, lighting the great lamp on time every night, protecting the thousands upon thousands of passing travelers, rich and poor, young and old, and never failing.</p>
<p>Speaking of this father and daughter's past history, it was also very bitter. The father was originally a fisherman in Zheyang Bay. There were many fish in the bay, and this man was strong enough to haul nets weighing hundreds of pounds, and he could also dive into the water to catch sea cucumbers, shrimp, and shellfish. His business at the fish market was not bad. But as time went on, his business declined. At that time, there was too much seaweed being imported. Countless seaweeds and fish were shipped in every year from Ryukyu, Taiwan, and Japan. People used large ships to fish in the open sea, using large machines to raise nets and using guns to catch fish. There were very many people on the fishing boats, so there was no danger, and the results were very great. The caught fish were loaded onto transport ships and exempted from taxes by their governments. Sometimes even the shipping costs were waived. They were sent to China. Because of treaty relations, China could only collect very low taxes on these foreign goods, and sometimes they were even tax-free. Of course, these imported seafoods were much cheaper than the fish of Chinese fishermen. People all loved to buy them. Chinese fishermen risked their lives to catch some fish, which was the source of their family's food and clothing, and they had to pay very high taxes. When they sold the fish, they naturally had to charge more. In addition, the fish brokers also took a cut, earning some money, which made the fish even more expensive.</p>
<p>At that time, Merlin's family consisted of four people: his eldest son, his wife, and little Macris, who was only seven years old. They were all strong, except for Madam Mai, who was weak from giving birth too many times and could only do housework. Although little Macris was only seven years old, she had always lived on the sea with her father and brother. When the fishing boat went out, the father and son cast the nets, and she steered the boat. When her father dived into the water, she forced her brother to guard the boat, and she would jump into the water herself to catch some shrimp and crabs. Occasionally, if she wasn't careful and her hand got pinched by a crab, she would always clench her fist, turning her small face iron-gray, without saying a word. When her brother asked her, she would glare at him and say that he was looking down on her. She liked to use a harpoon to spear fish the most. Her father made a lighter harpoon for her, and the three of them fished together. Because the sea was full of reefs and dangers, they inevitably ran into trouble often. Sometimes there were accidents at the lighthouse, or the lighthouse keeper was derelict in his duty, or the tower was poorly built and blown down by the wind. Not only were there problems at night, but there were also bad things happening during the day. When the father and son encountered people in need of rescue, hearing cries for help, they would always row the fishing boat out. At this time, Macris bravely stood at the bow of the boat or extended the harpoon and pole to the people in the water, or she would jump into the water herself, never letting her father and brother get ahead of her. She was strong, and the seawater had tempered her muscles and bones. The dangerous life at sea had also nurtured her heroic and unyielding spirit, and she loved to work. She didn't know what danger was, and she didn't know that there were difficult things in the world. Therefore, although the environment was bad and life was insecure, with the support of the three of them, fishing was not absolutely impossible, if the new exploitation mentioned below had not occurred.</p>
<p>When politics are bad and society is unstable, the people suffer. There were originally pirates on the Fujian seas, all of them poor men without clothes or food, who were brave and fierce. At first, they occupied the islands and made a living by robbery. The water police stations, which were paid to do nothing and evaded their duties, were already lucky if the pirates didn't come looking for them, so how could they dare to offend them? It was best if the pirates were considerate of them and never disturbed the ships of those great men and generals, but only robbed merchants and extorted from some semi-poor, semi-rich travelers. The pirates' power grew, and they implemented a division of spheres of influence, occupying the sea lanes to become aquatic overlords. They ordered the coastal fishing households to pay sea taxes every month in order to fish freely. If anyone didn't pay, they would tie them up and beat them, setting a deadline for payment. If they didn't pay after the deadline, they would tie them to large stones and throw them into the sea. The fishermen could only obey the overlords, because they couldn't resist themselves, and they didn't have the equipment. If they reported to the officials, there was a risk of leaking information to the pirates.</p>
<p>The Mai family's days became even more troublesome because of this. At first, they didn't have enough clothes to wear, but eating wasn't a problem. Except for the sick and thin mother, the father and son were quite strong, and it didn't seem like they weren't getting enough to eat. Later, even eating became a bit difficult. Those who should eat four bowls ate two and a half, patted their bellies, and drank another bowl of water, and they felt like they could manage. There were also many times when they changed the rice that should be cooked into porridge. It was common for Fujian people to eat porridge instead of rice, but that porridge was really just mushy rice, not what these poor fishermen had in their pots. Reducing food did not alleviate the Mai family's difficulties. People who sell their strength don't have enough strength if they eat less, and their work also suffers. Little Macris's round face slowly lost its color, and her father and brother's brows were often furrowed. They owed a lot of taxes and debts.</p>
<p>One day, Macris's brother went out to sea alone, and he didn't return at night. Merlin took his daughter Macris and borrowed someone else's boat to row out to sea to search for him. He also went to the homes of friends and acquaintances and the taverns to inquire, but there was no news at all. Little Macris thought that her brother must have had an accident at sea. Relying on her own skills, she cried all night and wanted her father to go out to sea with her again to search, but her father ignored her. The two adults were a little worried, fearing that their son had not fallen into the sea but had been lost on an island. However, they didn't tell Macris this, and they coaxed her to sleep. The next day, they got news of their son from the tavern. Sure enough, the disaster of not paying the sea tax for three months had already erupted. The son was now tied up in the pirates' dungeon, and he had to pay the money within two days in order to get out. How could they deal with this? The master can't understand the plight of the slave, because he doesn't know that money is not easy to obtain. He only feels that you have money but are reluctant to take it out to pay taxes. This kind of malicious and treacherous heart is hateful and murderous. In reality, the slave has already reached the end of his rope. He can only borrow but cannot repay. Finally, people are unwilling to lend, and he himself doesn't dare to ask. Everything that can be pawned has already been used up, and it can't be saved to this point to relieve the disaster.</p>
<p>The result is known to everyone. Time and deadlines never forgive people and are unwilling to take a slow step for anyone. The pirates are as ruthless as time. The Mai family's son lost his life. When Madam Mai heard the result of her son's fate, she cried to death on the spot. The family of four was reduced to just an old father and a young daughter!</p>
<p>After this heartbreaking event, Merlin also gave up fishing. He took his daughter and left his old home. With the help of friends, he went to the water police station to become a patrolman. Because Macris grew up on the sea, her face grew sullen if she didn't see the sea for a day. She would get sick if she didn't row a small boat out to sea and stir up the waves a few times. The sea breeze and waves were her air. How could she live without these? As for the father himself, he would look at the vast and boundless sea, guarding the masts that had been broken by the mighty waves, and shed tears.</p>
<p>They didn't stay at the water police station for long before they retired and took on the duty of guarding the lighthouse. There were no residents on the island. There was only a very large tower standing tall in the clouds. At the top of the tower was a glass room with a large lamp with a strong reflection hanging inside. Standing under the light and looking out at the sea, the strange and dangerous small islands were clearly visible. The red markers indicating dangerous shoals and sands in the distance were all in sight. No ghostly secret dangers could be hidden at all. The person who lit this great lamp stood under the light of thousands of miles and watched with his own eyes as the large ships, loaded and bulging, broke through the white waves and roared away, leaving those scheming and treacherous reef islands to stare at each other, unable to move. He felt very comforted and very happy.</p>
<p>Merlin had struggled for half his life and lost his wife and children. He never expected that at this most heartbreaking time, life at sea could still give him a little meaning worth cherishing, and he was greatly encouraged in spirit. His daughter Macris was older than before and more sensible. In addition to rowing the small boat under the lighthouse with her father to go to sea, she herself could follow her mother's old method of washing the rice three times, putting it in the pot, and adding more than twice as much water to steam it. There were fish, shrimp, shellfish, and snails near the shore. She carefully scooped them up and cooked them according to her mother's method for her father to eat with wine. Behind the small house was originally a small vegetable garden. The father hated fishing, so he put his strength into planting green vegetables and turnips. When the father was planting vegetables, Macris would go to the well to draw water, bringing it up bucket by bucket without any effort. Finally, the father would say that it was enough and tell her to stand aside and rest. She would put her hands on her hips, stick out her chest, and say, "Huh, who's tired! It's just two buckets of water!" Then she would pick up a large wooden ladle to water the plants for her father. The father would ask, "Macris? How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Nine years old. What for?"</p>
<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>
<p>"Afraid of kidnappers kidnapping you, afraid of big fish eating you, afraid of falling into the sea and drowning."</p>
<p>"Huh, I'll hit the kidnappers with a paddle, I'll drag the big fish up with a net for Dad to drink wine; falling into the sea, huh, the sea can't drown people, people can swim, didn't I just run away?"</p>
<p>The father would lift his head and look at her and say:</p>
<p>"Thousands of people have drowned on big ships, child. We have rescued people before. Don't people know how to swim?"</p>
<p>Macris became worried and didn't say anything. The father was afraid of boring her, so he said:</p>
<p>"Are you afraid after all?"</p>
<p>Macris shook her head, squatted down, turned her father's neck, and said face to face seriously:</p>
<p>"Dad! With us guarding the lamp, will thousands of people still drown on the big ships?"</p>
<p>Dad said, "We can protect them at night, but how can we say about during the day?"</p>
<p>Macris was worried about this. Whether it was day or night, whenever she heard the wind blowing at sea, she would climb to her window facing the sea to look, to see if there were ships in distress on the islands in the distance. One day, before dawn, Macris was suddenly awakened from a dream by a great wind, thunder, and rain. She jumped out of bed and ran to the window to look. Although in the darkness of the fierce wind and thunder, the light of the lighthouse still shone with flames in all directions, illuminating the entire sea. In the distance, she saw what appeared to be broken masts and a wrecked ship near Broken Heart Island, and she vaguely saw things crawling there, like people. She turned around and ran to her father's room, and saw her father sitting on the bed wrapped in a quilt, facing the window. Lightning flashed across his face, which was extremely painful and frightening. Macris ran up and grabbed her father, saying:</p>
<p>"Dad! Get up, go! Go save people!"</p>
<p>Merlin slowly turned his face, touched Macris, and said:</p>
<p>"Child, this wind and rain are very strong, I'm afraid we can't go."</p>
<p>"No, no, we must go! With us guarding the tower, we can't let people die on the big ships! Why should they die? No, go save people! Go save people!" After saying this, she ran outside with tears streaming down her face. Her father immediately jumped down, grabbed her, and put clothes on her, saying:</p>
<p>"Okay, good child, we'll go. It doesn't matter if we father and daughter die for the sake of thousands of people!" As he said this, he put on his clothes, put on a life buoy, packed up the boat, and walked down to the boat. The sky was gradually brightening, but the wind and waves had not diminished. The father and daughter tried their best to support the small boat, struggling forward in the surging waves. Sometimes they were thrown into the air by the waves, and sometimes they fell down as if they were falling into a deep valley. The rain and waves washed over them, and their clothes and hair were all soaked. Finally, relying on their expert skills, they steadily drove the boat to Broken Heart Island. The father climbed ashore, and Macris parked the boat in a sheltered place. Next to the island lay a half-sunken wrecked ship, revealing half of a chimney. There were some scattered objects and several floating corpses drifting on the sea, which were also being thrown and beaten by the waves, without any resistance at all. After a while, Merlin carried a person from the island, followed by many people, all with emaciated faces and broken clothes, hanging wetly on their bodies. They all got on the boat. Those who had been injured were carried on the back and laid on the bottom of the boat to drive back to Liudao. Macris, regardless of fatigue, quickly took out her father's clothes for everyone to change, and she hugged firewood to make a fire so that everyone could roast their clothes. She made the food in her house for everyone to eat their fill. She also served those who were injured in the same way, jumping in and out, talking and laughing, amusing those who had suffered misfortune and lost their relatives so that everyone liked her, calling her their savior and their god of joy.</p>
<p>According to the survivors of the shipwrecked ship, because the steam boiler was broken, the ship could not move easily. When it encountered wind and waves, it lost control even more and was blown onto the island, hitting a large reef. The entire ship was shattered, and only these twelve people who were rescued this time were left out of several hundred people on board. These twelve lives were completely saved by Macris and her father's willingness to sacrifice themselves. Everyone spoke of it with gratitude and sadness, not knowing how to repay them. Night came, and Merlin fell ill because he was too cold. Macris alone arranged places for many people to rest, and she groped in the great wind and rain, climbed up the high tower, and still lit that great light that rescued people from suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e140">"A Year-End Summary" <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Po</p>
<p>Culture and Construction, December Issue</p>
<p>After reading the December issue of the Culture and Construction Monthly, published this year (Republic of China Year 25) by the Culture and Construction Monthly Society, we feel that the society's enthusiasm and achievements in engaging in Chinese cultural construction work are very commendable. This is not a blind praise; we only need to look at the articles in the December issue of the journal to believe it without a doubt.</p>
<p>Among all the articles in the journal, the most important topic is of course the "Year-End Summary" type of articles. There are six articles in total: (1) Jia He's "Sino-Japanese Relations in the Past Year"; (2) Wu Yugan's "China's International Trade in the Past Year"; (3) Zhang Sumin's "China's Finance and Fiscal Policy in the Past Year"; (4) Xu Xingchu's "Domestic Affairs and Foreign Affairs in the Past Year"; (5) Hui Jianyi's "International Political Relations in the Past Year"; (6) Xiao Ai's "The Newspapers of Beiping and Tianjin in the Past Year." The first and fourth articles are descriptive and reporting articles; in addition to describing the true historical facts, the authors also point out the correct views on the issues, which can be used to dispel foreigners' misunderstandings and fallacies about our country. The second and third articles are research and statistical articles, and they also fulfill their duties. As for the sixth article, it can be said to be a very rare piece of research material; it analyzes the changes in the newspapers of the Beiping and Tianjin areas and the oppression they have suffered from powerful enemies very clearly, so it is a very meaningful and valuable work.</p>
<p>In short, we are quite satisfied with the above six articles; especially the first and sixth articles can be called the best achievements among them. Other articles, such as Fan Zhongyun's "The Suiyuan War and the International Situation," Li Jianfang's "On the Chinese Communist Party and Its Recent Transformation," and Li Hengzhi's "Impressions of the Japanese Publishing Industry," can also be said to be very worthwhile to read. In conclusion, we are still satisfied with this issue of the Culture and Construction Monthly. However, we hope that the journal will have to expand its materials in the future; because in addition to political, diplomatic, economic, and other issues, there are other equally important issues in cultural construction work, such as religion, art, and science. These matters should not be ignored in practice.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Publishing Industry and New Year's Cards <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Zhiqi</p>
<p>New Year's cards are a kind of gift to celebrate the New Year. They have many styles and literary styles, and like human beings, they have expressions of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In short, they convey friendship between human beings with diverse, beautiful, elegant, and fresh postures.</p>
<p>Therefore, every New Year, the publishing industry produces a large number of New Year's cards to supply people's needs. Because human hearts are fond of novelty, the patterns of New Year's cards are newer year after year, truly changing in a myriad of ways, countless.</p>
<p>Although there are many patterns of New Year's cards sold on the market today, after careful inspection, there are not many that are truly good-looking. There is also a kind of New Year's card that is bought from abroad, and the quantity actually accounts for the majority. The cards are all in English, and naturally there is not a single Chinese character. Although that kind is prepared for Westerners, the quantity it occupies is always too large. At the same time, many compatriots also take pride in using this kind of style, so Western New Year's cards are prevalent in our country, and this has become a common phenomenon today. In fact, in all fairness, this is also a kind of self-humiliating policy of our own culture, that is, the strong color of the people of a semi-colonial area. Therefore, we feel that although New Year's cards are a small matter, we should also hope that they can be transformed to create various new and meaningful styles that can fully express the consciousness of customs and culture and the concepts of the country and the nation, or the improvement of personal and group life and the knowledge of new things, etc. Therefore, I believe that the publishing industry should pay more attention to the following items in terms of text and images for the production of New Year's cards in the future:</p>
<p>(1) Aphorisms of Famous People Past and Present—The aphorisms of sages and worthies of China in the past dynasties provide very detailed instructions on the way to conduct oneself in the world, the way to treat people, and the way to deal with things. Many of them are as precious as gold and stone, and can be regarded as the standard for self-improvement for life. It is especially appropriate to select their essence and print them on New Year's cards to guide friends to introduce each other, which will naturally be of great benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Portraits and Photographs of Famous People Past and Present—There are many materials in this regard, such as famous sages, philosophers, politicians, writers, scientists, revolutionaries, and other people who have virtue, integrity, and achievements in history and are believed by the people, all of which can be used for printing on New Year's cards. We believe that they can give people many inspirations and encouragements.</p>
<p>(3) Historical Sites and Cultural Relics—Our country has thousands of years of long history, and the famous historical sites left by each dynasty, such as the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven, the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, the Summer Palace, the Tengwang Pavilion, or important cultural relics, etc., are all excellent materials.</p>
<p>(4) Famous Scenery and Unique Products of Various Provinces and Cities—There are even more materials of this kind. China is indeed not lacking in famous mountains and rivers, the Milky Way in the Three Gorges, the natural barrier of the Shu Road, the setting sun over the Yellow River, the Yangtze River like a piece of white silk, the towering Mounts of the Five Sacred Mountains, Huangshan, Mount Lu, Tiantai, Yandang, Emei, the scenic spots of Mount Tiantai, Yandang, Emei, and the Sun and Moon Mountains, and the filming of the famous products of various places, such as forests, minerals, rice, millet, fruit trees, cattle, and sheep, etc., are all very interesting, and you can gain a little common sense in a pleasant and joyful way.</p>
<p>(5) Filming of Famous Calligraphy and Paintings Past and Present—There are so many materials about calligraphy and paintings in our country that they are countless. Famous works such as landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, etc., and the legal scripts of ancient and modern people can be selected for filming and printing. In addition, excellent modern woodcuts, oil paintings, etc., can also be selected. In short, those with an aesthetic or touching appearance can be printed.</p>
<p>(6) Photography of Great New Buildings in Modern China—In recent years, China's various buildings have made great progress, and great buildings such as the Qiantang River Iron Bridge and the Shanghai Sports Stadium can be photographed and printed on cards, so that the people can see their miniature, on the one hand, they can have many admiration for the country's construction, and on the other hand, they can also use this as a yearning, which is naturally very necessary.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples, all of which are sufficient materials for making New Year's cards. Using New Year's cards to promote our own national culture and instilling a little good knowledge and feelings at the time of New Year's happiness is welcomed by everyone. Therefore, the publishing industry in China today must take on this mission that is usually not noticed by the public. This is a small opinion I have about New Year's cards.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Yuan Changying's "The Peacock Flies Southeast" and Others <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Kui Feng</p>
<p>"The Peacock Flies Southeast" (II)</p>
<p>As for the depiction of the characters' personalities, perhaps the author focused on their inherent viewpoints. The true personalities become obscured in the overly elaborate dialogues. Zhongqing's cowardice and incompetence, and Jiao's mother's isolated irritability, are relatively well-written and can be considered relatively successful. However, it is a pity that we do not see a deep and resolute personality in Lanzhi, the tragic protagonist who deserves the most sympathy. Some may think that describing personality as deep and resolute is too arbitrary. However, a person who is willing to suffer and dares to sacrifice cannot endure beatings for love, nor can they face death for love, without a deep attitude and a resolute will. Although she ultimately became a sacrificed weak woman, she had a price for her sacrifice, and that price is the eternal spiritual victory.</p>
<p>D. Some Points for Discussion</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Regarding the characters, a few opinions have been briefly put forward in the previous paragraph, that is, Lanzhi's character is written too weakly and is too obscure. Perhaps this is due to differences in the author's personal understanding. Of course, the writer cannot force agreement. However, this is an opinion worth pondering. The smartest people in the world are madmen, and the bravest people in the world are those who commit suicide. If a person has the courage to make the final decision to commit suicide, that courage can enable them to do many things that others cannot. Suicide is not passive, let alone a sign of weakness. Lanzhi's ending was to automatically invite Yiqing to die together. Before her death, she was not without hope, so she could endure pain that others could not bear. This is not to say that Lanzhi should be portrayed as a shrewd and decisive woman, absolutely not. Rather, it is to say that in Lanzhi's actions and words, even though she is shedding tears and lamenting her fate, there should be a force that expresses her unique personality. This is the life that the playwright gave during the writing process, and now I am putting it forward as an opinion, which may be difficult for people to understand.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I don't know the author's place of origin, but it can be asserted that the author's "mother tongue" should be the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with the accents of Hubei and Hunan being the most common. This kind of accent permeates the entire play's lines, which is a small shortcoming. This is not to obliterate regionalism. Sometimes, in order to cope with the current environment, a play written entirely in local dialect is specially written, but this is an exception. Since the nature of spoken drama extends to the whole country, it is best to use Mandarin Chinese as the dialogue.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The most taboo thing in a complete script is soliloquy. The playwright would rather insert a little more events and characters to express the part that needs to be a soliloquy in a roundabout way. The shortcomings of soliloquy are, first, it constrains the actor's expression, and second, it cannot gain the audience's sympathy. Because, since it is a play, the audience absolutely hates direct plots, which are both boring and dull. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e144">Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve; Silver and Money Industries Handle Closing Accounts; All Banks and Firms Extend Hours Internally and Externally; Finance is Very Stable; Money Supply Remains Loose <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve for the silver and money industries to close their accounts. All banks and firms are extending their working hours internally and externally. The bank clearing house is increasing the clearing once. The profits of all banks and firms will be collected and published by the association. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Two Industries Close Accounts</p>
<p>The closing of accounts in the banking industry has always been at the end of the Lunar New Year. The interest on savings deposits in the savings and commercial departments has been implemented one after another. Because the closing of accounts is approaching, the internal office hours yesterday were extended by two or three hours. Today is Lunar New Year's Eve, and the external office hours will be extended by one or two hours. The internal office hours will be extended until all accounts are cleared. The time for accepting bills in the money industry will be extended to 4:00 p.m., and the time for returning bills will be extended to 8:00 p.m. The internal office hours will also be extended until all accounts are cleared.</p>
<p>Increased Clearing</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Bank Clearing House on January 10th, 1933, the member banks of the association have joined as clearing banks or entrusted the reserve committee to clear on their behalf. At the same time, the Central Bank has joined as a primary clearing bank. Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve. In addition to the usual clearing at 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., an additional clearing will be added at 5:00 p.m. As for the total clearing amount yesterday, it has increased to 10,469,396.71 yuan.</p>
<p>Financial Stability</p>
<p>This year, agricultural products in various places have been harvested, and various industries are very active. The loans issued by the silver and money industries, whether credit or mortgage, can be recovered on time. At the same time, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank are making every effort to regulate interbank finance and are lending as much as possible to relieve various industries. Therefore, even though yesterday was the day before the Lunar New Year's Eve, the Shanghai market's overnight interest rate still stood at 9 points per thousand yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, which is very different from previous years, which is enough to prove the stability of Shanghai's finance.</p>
<p>Banks and Firms' Profits</p>
<p>After the annual closing of accounts, each bank will take a four-day holiday from the first day in accordance with the regulations of the association, including the end-of-year holidays. As for the profits of each bank, they will be reported to the association after each bank has calculated them, and then the association will collect and publish them. The large commercial banks can all make a slight profit. As for the money firms, they will take a three-day holiday from the first day. Although they will close their accounts once on the Lunar New Year's Eve, their final closing of accounts will still be on February 16th (i.e., the end of the lunar year). Therefore, the profits of each firm must be published by the association after the end of the lunar year, it is said.</p>

The representative delegation's office of the association has long been established and has been approved by the Executive Yuan for record. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Railways will provide assistance. As for the product collection method, it is divided into two parts: cultural education and industrial and commercial technology. Regarding cultural and educational competition products, the Ministry of Education will issue a notice to the education departments of all provinces, the municipal education bureaus, various specialized schools, vocational schools, and cultural institutions and scientific groups to produce and compete. Regarding industrial and commercial technology products, in addition to the producers who participated in the Belgian Independence Centennial Exposition last time, the representative delegation's office will send a letter to them to solicit them, and the recently organized members of the micro-collection product committee will work hard to collect them. The representative delegation's office sent a letter to all parties to collect products and recorded it on the left: "Dear Sirs, the French government has decided to hold the International Exposition of Modern Literature and Technology in Paris on May 1 next year.

It is believed that the friendly relations between China and France have always been extremely strong. The French government is holding an international exposition in Paris this time, and many people from all countries will go to visit. Because Paris is the most prosperous city in the world, with talented people gathered and merchants gathered, our country's participation in this competition is not only related to international prestige and international status, but also an important key to communication between Chinese and foreign cultures and promotion of foreign trade. We should actively carry out the work in order to achieve success. However, the collection of items depends on the cooperation and support of the educational, cultural, industrial, and commercial circles in the country.

<h3 id="e152">Paramount Restaurant Creditors' Meeting Passes Settlement - 15% Cash Repayment Per Hundred Yuan, Submitted to Court for Approval and Supervision of Implementation <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the closure of the Paramount Restaurant, the debtor, Dacheng Company, immediately applied to the First Special District Court for bankruptcy. The court accepted the case and formally ruled the bankruptcy on the 30th of last month. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the first creditors' meeting was convened at Jincheng Villa on Jing'an Temple Road. A Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the meeting details below:</p>
<p>Creditors' Meeting</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included Judge Jiang Gongliang from the First Special District Court, bankruptcy administrator Accountant An Shaoyun, debtor Zhu Hongru, and creditors with a total claim of over 262,000 yuan (the declared claim amount totals over 310,000 yuan). Judge Jiang presided over the meeting and announced the purpose of the meeting. Then, Accountant An reported on the total debt and asset situation of the Paramount. Finally, the debtor Zhu Hongru proposed a settlement plan. After the creditors discussed and amended it item by item, the whole body voted for approval. Judge Jiang then announced that the settlement plan had been approved by the whole body and would be submitted to the court for approval, after which the debtor would be supervised to implement it. The meeting adjourned at just after 4 PM.</p>
<p>Settlement Proposal</p>
<p>The reconciliation plan passed by yesterday's creditors' meeting is recorded as follows: "Upon investigation, the Paramount Restaurant operated by Dacheng Co., Ltd. suffered business failure due to the post-war economic downturn, and its capital was almost entirely lost. On July 10, 1936, a temporary emergency shareholders' meeting resolved to elect four representatives to fully represent all shareholders to find a better way to deal with the closure and liquidation. Unexpectedly, a case of more than 100,000 yuan in unpaid rent occurred, resulting in the execution and auction of the Paramount's assets, causing huge sacrifices and even greater losses. As a last resort, we had no choice but to request a declaration of bankruptcy. Hongru's sin is unforgivable. Fortunately, after pleading everywhere, a portion of cash was raised, so that 15 yuan can be obtained for every 100 yuan of allocated claim amount. It is clear that this method is originally difficult to satisfy people, but the people who lent the money declared that they were all committed to settling matters and helping to achieve coordination after bankruptcy. Only after the settlement is established can it be handed over to the bankruptcy administrator for legal distribution. It is not easy to obtain, and the opportunity is rare. Please, creditor gentlemen, give Hongru extra forgiveness and reluctantly accept it to bring it to an end. The settlement plan is listed below: Within two weeks after the establishment of the settlement, the debtor shall raise cash according to 15% of the claim amount and submit it to the bankruptcy administrator for distribution. The creditors agree to waive the remaining amount as final settlement, Zhu Hongru."</p>
<h3 id="e153">Fire at Jiru Lane, Girl Suffocated and Body Claimed <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Faji National Goods Umbrella Factory at No. 6 Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street, French Concession, was opened by Zhu Changfa (31 years old) from Zhenjiang. The business was relatively developed. The factory building was a three-story, two-up, two-down building with a wing room. Zhu's family also lived in the factory. At 0:35 AM on the 29th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the factory, and a girl was suffocated to death. The details have been briefly recorded in the newspaper. When the fire broke out at 8 AM, factory owner Zhu Changfa and his family and workers were awakened from their sleep. Zhu first rescued two children and escaped. He then wanted to turn back to rescue another girl, Liu Fengying (13 years old), but was blocked by the flames and could not enter. The girl had already been awakened and wanted to escape, but was suffocated by the flames. The fire brigade arrived, poured water to rescue, and rescued the girl Fengying, but she was unconscious. She was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but died before treatment could be administered. The police sent the body to the autopsy office. The factory was extinguished after one hour of emergency rescue. The police sent detectives to investigate the cause of the fire and reported to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who came to the scene with forensic scribes to verify the body of Fengying. Because factory owner Zhu Changfa surrendered to the police station for investigation and was unable to claim the body, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall to transfer the body to the family. Yesterday morning, Zhu Changfa, accompanied by the deceased's uncle Liu Yandao, requested the prosecutor of the Second Special Court to claim the body for burial. The request was approved. It is reported that the factory had fire insurance, and the loss this time was quite large. What was obtained could hardly compensate for what was lost.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Tong Hanchun Pharmaceutical Company Debt Lawsuit Trial <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Tong Hanchun Pharmaceutical Company in Xiaodongmen has a history of more than 100 years and its business is thriving. It was managed by Tong Guangfu. In July 1932, it was sold to the Xu family in Hangzhou, and Song Fuchen was replaced as manager. Previously, when Tong Guangfu was the manager, the company owed the Minghua Bank a principal and interest of 39,386.45 yuan. The Minghua Bank went bankrupt, and its bankruptcy liquidator, Lawyer Li Mian, sued Tong Hanchun Pharmaceutical Company and Tong Guangfu, requesting joint and several repayment of the full amount. The current manager of the company, Song Fuchen, also hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that the Tong Hanchun Pharmaceutical Company had been sold to the Xu family in Hangzhou and had been renamed Xingji, etc. Yesterday, Judge Pang held a trial. The plaintiff stated the facts and said that there was no proof of when Xingji was added. At this point, Tong Guangfu's lawyer stated that Tong Guangfu had deposited 250,000 yuan in the bank in the name of Maoji. The remaining amount was offset elsewhere, and there were still more than 50,000 yuan in deposit slips, which were sufficient for offsetting. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer said, "If there are such deposit slips, why not deposit them in the name of Tong Hanchun and Guangfu, etc.? Why deposit them in the name of Maoji? There is obviously a question that should be investigated further." At this point, witness Chen Caishao testified that he was formerly an accountant at Tong Hanchun and is now a counter clerk. It was formerly opened by the Tong family of the Renli, Renxiao, and Renti branches. The Renti branch is Tong Guangfu. At the end of July 1932, it was reorganized, and the new shareholders were Xu Kong, Shen, and others. The Tong family withdrew completely. The official ordered a postponement to January 9 at 1:30 PM for further hearing.</p>

<p>Defamation Verdict</p>
<p>Lawyer Tao Gan, previously because Tao Longtu (reportedly his nephew) and Zhang Zhiman from Jiangbei were involved in a fraud case, Tao Longtu was sentenced to six months in prison by the local court. However, during the litigation, Tao Longtu's wife hired Tao Gan to send a letter to the Xinzha Branch to accuse Wu Yanling, the owner of Hengtong Hotel and a fellow villager, of robbery. After Wu was cleared, he sued Tao Gan in court for instigating false accusations. Subsequently, after the newspaper published a correction by Tao Gan, he pointed out that Wu was an illegal person who had been involved in trafficking people, etc. Wu then sued the court accusing Tao Gan of defamation. Yesterday, Judge Zhang ruled that Tao Gan spread words defaming others and fined him 100 yuan. If he performs labor service instead, it will be calculated at one yuan per day.</p>

Now, he is contributing what he has researched for more than 20 years to society. His great wish is to promote national glory, which cannot be compared with ordinary profit-seeking. Therefore, his prices are extremely low and he uses small plates, so it is convenient to have small drinks, which will make the customers obtain extremely satisfactory results at the lowest cost, breaking the long-standing practice of Sichuan cuisine with large wine vessels and high prices.

<p>To the Editor: We have examined the news item "State-owned China Merchants Bureau Opens Joint Transport, Exchange, and Delivery of Goods" published on page 11 of the third edition of your newspaper on the 8th of this month. The various articles listed in the "Notice to Merchants on Exchange" are inconsistent with the most recent regulations. The following corrections are made: 1. Direct ticketing for Shantou-Guangzhou joint cargo is still transshipped through Shanghai. 2. The handling fee for collecting the price of goods is slightly charged at 1% of the amount collected. 3. The latest regulations between the road and the ship stipulate that for water-joint cargo within the scope of the voyage, if losses are discovered, the ship bureau shall be liable to the cargo owner for compensation in the same amount as the railway department according to the "Regulations on Railway Cargo Transportation" issued by the Ministry of Railways, with the value of the goods at the time of shipment as the maximum limit. 4. For water and fire disasters, since July 1 of this year, the railway department has regarded the loss of goods due to fire as ordinary loss and is responsible to the cargo owner according to the regulations. The shipping company is now also preparing to be equally responsible for losses from water and fire disasters within the scope of sea transportation and is currently in the process of making regulations. Correspondingly inform you, I hope you will check and correct it to be in line with the facts and avoid misunderstandings. To show our friendship, to the editorial department of Shen Bao, China Merchants Bureau, December 29, 1936.</p>

<p>Li Daochai, also known as Yuqing, the general manager of the Shenglida Victory Medical Instrument Company in the Zhonghe Building on Shanxi Road, is from Ningbo. His family lives at No. 2, Shunde Lane, No. 340 Aiwenyi Road. At 9:30 AM on the 28th of this month, he suddenly received a threatening letter from a bandit party named He Yeshan. It briefly stated, "I have long heard of your great name, like thunder in my ears. Please consider the friendship of being from the same hometown and borrow 2,000 legal currency. If someone plots against you in the future,</p>
<p>I will prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>Also, please send the money to Feilong Dance School at No. 3 Yuren Lane, Yuqiaqing Road at 3 PM on the 29th." Li then took the letter to report to the Xinzha Police Station, which specially dispatched Chinese Detective Huang Siming to go with Li Daochai on time the day before yesterday. The detectives ambushed outside, and Li entered the Feilong Dance School alone. After a while, He A'wu, a Ningbo native, came forward and asked Li, and invited Li to negotiate in Room 239 of the Old Oriental Hotel on Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Li pretended to agree</p>
<p>and went out together. He was arrested by the detectives. When they went to the Old Oriental Hotel to arrest his accomplice He Shihui, he had already fled after hearing the news. He was arrested and detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and stated the case, requesting a postponement in order to verify the handwriting and arrest the accomplices. Then, according to the Old</p>
<p>Oriental Hotel</p>
<p>Tea server Chen Youfa surrendered himself and presented the circulation book, proving that Room 2 was opened by He Shihui, but the room fee was paid by the defendant. When questioned, the defendant He A'wu confessed that he was previously a sailor leader on a certain ship of the Jardine Matheson Shipping Company and knew He Shihui well, but had not seen him for many years. The day before yesterday, in Nanshi,</p>
<p>Zhonghua Tea House,</p>
<p>they met. He said that he had a relative surnamed Li and wanted to go to the Feilong Dance School tomorrow. He wanted to borrow money from Li, so he asked me to invite Li to the Oriental Hotel. That's why I went to Feilong yesterday to invite Li out and was arrested. It was found that the threatening letter was written by He. The presiding judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and a postponement of seven days for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Drug Offenders' Last Chance for Survival - All Drug Offenders Will Be Shot from Tomorrow Onward - Unlicensed Smokers Will Be Punished as Private Smokers - Foreign Drug Offenders Without Consular Jurisdiction Will Be Punished According to the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Laws <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Since receiving the instructions from the Anti-Smoking Headquarters, the municipal public security authorities have intensified and expanded anti-drug propaganda this week to encourage drug offenders to confess and quit as soon as possible to avoid the legal net. Director Dai Changye and others from the Public Security Bureau's competent department supervised the city's police to set out in groups to conduct publicity and investigation with all their might. According to Director Ye of the Public Security Bureau's Fourth Division, who spoke to a Guomin News Agency reporter, the anti-drug matters in this city will be implemented in accordance with the anti-drug laws promulgated by the central government. The end of the month (ie today) is the last chance to confess and the last chance for drug offenders to survive. From tomorrow on, all drug offenders arrested will be dealt with by military law and sent to the headquarters for execution by firing squad to emphasize political orders. The third phase of license renewal for smokers in this city is also scheduled to end today. From tomorrow on, unlicensed smokers will be punished as private smokers. Therefore, today (ie today) drug offenders in this city should quickly confess voluntarily, then they can still be saved. Otherwise, while others celebrate New Year's Day, drug offenders will directly throw themselves to their deaths. As for foreign drug cases without consular jurisdiction, the two temporary regulations on punishing smoking and drug crimes will also apply. Therefore, drug offenders cannot take refuge in the concession and remain at large.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a provincial order to conduct a general review from January 1 to January 31, 1937. Drug offenders who are arrested will be sentenced to death. The county government began to conduct propaganda in various districts from the 16th of this month, allowing those who have not been reported to confess and receive rehabilitation to avoid criminal penalties. Now it has received another provincial order that, as the end of the year is very near, propaganda should be carried out daily in teams to ensure that propaganda work penetrates the people and promotes their awareness. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to distributing a large number of propaganda materials for posting, also sent personnel to the Anti-Smoking Association to give lectures on the harm of drugs in various townships every day. The day before yesterday, people were sent from various districts to beat gongs and inform households until the 31st. The general review will begin on New Year's Day in 1937. All implementation measures have been notified for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Shanghai Neon Light Manufacturing Industry (Continued) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor, China Credit</p>
<p>(Forty-First Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], J.L. Stellingweff and W. Stellingweff of Holland, along with others, raised ten thousand yuan in national currency to establish the International Neon Lights Co. Inc. U.S.A., setting up a factory at 36 Route Doumer [now East Huaihai Road]. In April of the 23rd year [1934], Chen Qiwei, who operated the Baiye Trading Company, founded the Dalai Neon Light Company. However, from the 22nd year onwards, the Shanghai market suffered from the impact of the global economic recession, and all industries were in decline. The neon light business was directly affected, and the business of various companies was far from what it used to be. The International Neon Lights Company, due to poor management, announced its closure in the 23rd year. The Fulaisheng and Huade factories had also stopped manufacturing neon lights and specialized in making light bulbs. The Tongming Company also soon stopped manufacturing and became a brokerage. The Xinguang, Meideng, and Ziguang factories reorganized one after another. Many other smaller factories went bankrupt. At this point, the neon light business was showing signs of decline!</p>
<p>Examining the comprehensive reasons, the impact of the economic recession was undoubtedly the main one, but there were also many other reasons. The scope of this industry could be large or small, and the cost of its machinery and equipment was less than that of other industries. Therefore, during the prosperous period of this industry, workers and staff of the larger factories, with a little savings, would set up their own factories, resulting in a proliferation of small factories and price competition. However, neon lights were relatively permanent goods, and merchants who could afford to install them had already done so. Furthermore, the business in other cities was unable to expand due to a lack of capital, resulting in a situation of oversupply, which led to the collapse of smaller factories and significant losses for larger ones due to competition.</p>
<p>Currently, there are fifteen companies remaining in the city, including Dongfang, Lian'an, Dalai, Dengmei, Xinguang, Ziguang, Datong, Guangming, Tongming, Da Shanghai, and Lihua. Among them, only Lian'an is still foreign-owned, while the rest are operated by Chinese. Dongfang is the largest and can be considered the leader in this industry.</p>
<p>Last year, Dongfang initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Neon Industry Trade Association" in the hope of coordinating steps and jointly seeking development. However, it ultimately failed due to other reasons. To this day, it remains in an unorganized state.</p>
<p>Three, Raw Materials and Manufacturing Methods</p>
<p>Neon lights are commonly available in four colors: red, blue, yellow, and green. The main raw material for their manufacture is neon gas glass tubing. Auxiliary materials include transformers, mercury iron shells, iron frames, copper, electric wires, etc., which are described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Neon Gas - including hydrogen (Neon Gas), argon (Argon), and helium (Helium). Hydrogen is used for red, argon for red and blue, and helium for yellow. Green is made by combining two gases. Chinese manufacturers are unable to produce these three gases themselves. The gases used in this city are all imported from Germany and the United States, with American goods being the most common. They are sealed in bottles during import and are colorless and transparent, so they appear to be nothing. Each bottle contains approximately 1000 CC. The current market price is approximately 57.3 yuan per 1000 CC of argon, slightly less than 50 yuan for argon, and around 50 yuan for helium. Although there are slight fluctuations, the difference is still minimal. Local dealers include the De Fu Foreign Firm Chemical Department (formerly Yilideng Pharmaceutical Factory), Kefa Pharmacy, Yali Foreign Firm, and several others. Japanese companies can also produce neon gas, but there are currently no Japanese goods imported to the market.</p>
<p>(2) Glass Tubing - There are several types of glass tubing, with size 3 being the most commonly used. Those used in shop windows are thinner. The price is calculated by the pound, with an average price of around two yuan per pound (approximately ten feet long). Local glass factories such as Sanxing, Tongxing, and Zhongyang factories can all produce them. Except for Dongfang, which now manufactures its own, most factories use domestic goods.</p>
<p>(3) Electrical Transformers (Transformers) - commonly known as transformers, their size is calculated by the pound. Because the current used by neon lights is higher than that of electric lights, transformers must be installed, regardless of size, to produce light. Their quantity is also calculated by the pound. The largest used by neon advertisements in this city is 18,000 pounds, and the smallest is only 4,000 pounds. Both domestic and foreign goods are available on the market. Foreign goods are best from the Westinghouse brand. Local companies such as Bailu Foreign Firm, Qianxin Machinery Company, Kainengda Co., Ltd., General Electric Company, Kongshi Foreign Firm, and Siemens Foreign Firm all sell them. Larger factories such as Asia Electric Company, Yaguang Manufacturing Factory, and Huasheng Electric Factory can all produce them. Japanese goods are also imported, with lower prices, but they are said to be more prone to damage. The price of transformers is the most expensive of the neon light raw materials. Small ones cost tens of yuan, while large ones cost two to three hundred yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e167">Indian Criminal Sentenced to Hanging Survives; Chinese and Foreign Funding Provided; Indian Criminal’s Wife Says Husband is Blessed by God; British Ambassador’s Telegram on Reduced Sentence Not Yet Announced; Western Newspaper Recounts Historically Interesting Events <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that an Indian man, Mr. Atma Singh, was being hanged in the Ward Road Prison on Tuesday morning when the rope suddenly broke. Although he suffered a brain injury upon falling to the ground, it was not serious, and he is expected to recover. He is currently in the police hospital. Reporters who went to the hospital to inquire about Mr. Singh’s reaction to not being hanged were unsuccessful, as hospital staff only stated that Mr. Singh was still alive and declined to comment further. This morning (Wednesday), a reporter from the North China Daily News visited Mr. Singh’s wife on Yulin Road. During the conversation, the wife was overjoyed, saying that her husband’s survival was entirely due to God’s blessing. Since her husband was convicted, she had firmly believed that God would bless the good and prevent him from dying. When asked about the broken rope, the wife replied that it was broken by the power of God. Her husband served in the police force and would pray in the temple for four hours every day, so this was his reward. The wife and her children are currently residing at a place that is not their home. The Singhs originally lived near the police station on Putuo Road, but after Mr. Singh committed the crime, the wife moved to a friend’s house. The wife also said that the authorities did not allow her to visit her husband, but she believed that her husband would recover because God would bless him. She said her husband would now be pardoned.</p>
<p>After this incident, the people of Shanghai were greatly surprised. The British and French Consuls-General in Shanghai, Sir Brenan, personally went to the Ward Road Prison this morning to investigate, fearing that the executioner had been derelict in his duty or had committed fraud. It is said that he intends to go again this afternoon. Some people are quite angry at the executioner for neglecting his duties. The authorities and prison officials are currently unwilling to disclose his name to protect him. It is said that he recently took a long leave and had only recently returned. According to the execution supervisor, the executioner was indeed absent-minded before the execution. It is also said that in September of this year, another Indian man was hanged in the Ward Road Prison.</p>
<p>The executioner's name was Mr. Gu Ding, who was an assistant at the time, but this time he was the main executioner. The rope used this time had been tested the previous night and was found to be very strong and suitable. Rumors from outside suggest that the rope was secretly replaced at night, but this rumor could not be confirmed as of this afternoon. It is said that only a small group of officials were present to supervise the execution. Many of them did not know what was happening until the executioner shouted, "Heavens, this is a tragedy!"</p>
<p>An accident occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh is about four feet eight inches tall and weighs one hundred and sixty-four pounds. He is not particularly large, so it is unreasonable to say that the rope could not bear his weight. Mr. Singh was born in India in 1904 and joined the Shanghai Municipal Police in 1924. His service was generally considered conscientious. After British Consul-General Sir Brenan telegraphed the British Ambassador in Beijing, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, about the matter, it is said that he received a telegram instructing him to reduce Mr. Singh’s sentence. However, as of this afternoon, it had not yet been announced.</p>
<p>A reporter from the North China Daily News consulted legal experts in the city regarding this matter. They all believed that, according to the laws of various countries, the sentence should not be reduced or pardoned. If a person does not die after one execution, they can be executed again. Common people mistakenly believe that those who survive hanging should be pardoned according to the law, because historically, there have been very few people who survived hanging and were pardoned.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Singh has been hanged but not died, British law does not explicitly state that he cannot be hanged again. However, this matter will be entirely decided by the British Ambassador. Although the law does not explicitly state that he cannot be hanged again, there are precedents for reducing or pardoning sentences. Forty or fifty years ago, in a certain place in England, a murderer was sentenced to hanging. The mechanism of the gallows suddenly did not work, so the person was not suspended in the air. The mechanism was repaired, but it still did not work. This happened three times in a row. On the fourth time, the warden announced that he did not want to</p>
<p>torture a living being.</p>
<p>So he released the person, who was later given a life sentence and eventually pardoned. He then became a publisher in London and became famous throughout the country for surviving three hangings. He died with considerable wealth. In the past, British doctors were allowed to take the bodies of those executed to conduct medical experiments. Once, a doctor revived the body of someone he had received. When the authorities found out, they pardoned the person. This is a</p>
<p>famous story</p>
<p>but it has never been verified. The Italian authorities in this city said that such an event would never happen in Italy today because people are executed by firing squad in Italy today. However, a hundred years ago, there was a person who was hanged but did not die and was pardoned. In Germany seven hundred years ago, during the feudal era, people were executed with a blade. The executioner’s job was quite difficult because if he could not sever the criminal’s neck with one stroke, he would be blamed and lose his own head. In America,</p>
<p>people are executed by electricity.</p>
<p>If a person does not die once, it can be done again until they die. However, in the past, when people were hanged, there was a person who was saved because the rope broke. It was later discovered that the person had been wrongly convicted because the real criminal had confessed. There is a Chinese story about a criminal who asked the executioner to cut off his hair first to test the sharpness of the knife. The executioner did as he was asked. The criminal’s family then rushed forward and shouted that the criminal only deserved one cut, and now that his hair had been cut off, his head should not be cut off again. The county magistrate was speechless and pardoned the criminal, punishing the executioner instead.</p>
<p>Reuters Shanghai, 30th. The British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Brenan, has instructed Reuters to publish the following announcement regarding the investigation into the case of the Indian man Atma Singh surviving hanging: "Today, the British Consul-General and a judge from the British Supreme Court for China inspected the case of Atma Singh surviving hanging in the Ward Road Prison, assisted by several rope experts. After detailed investigation and taking statements from many witnesses, the investigating committee is certain that the rope broke during the hanging due to unforeseen reasons. No one secretly replaced the rope. A detailed report on this case will be submitted to the British Ambassador to China soon."</p>
<h3 id="e168">Drug Trafficking Case Criminal to be Sentenced Today <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The French police recently cracked down on a private heroin trafficking operation at 21, Lane 505, Route Cardinal Mercier [now South Maoming Road], arresting two Japanese traffickers, as well as a Russian customer and a Chinese man named Huang Changsheng. Forty-six small packets of heroin were confiscated, each packet priced at two jiao. They were taken back to the police station, and the Japanese men, along with the evidence, were handed over to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. The Russian man escaped after being detained. The next day, only Huang was handed over to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. This newspaper has reported on these events twice. Yesterday, Judge Wang presided over a session in Criminal Court One to continue questioning Huang. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen prosecuted him according to Article 257 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, Huang denied trafficking, saying that he was looking for a child named A Da when he was arrested. However, the forensic doctor鉴定determined that Huang had no drug addiction. According to the Western detective, no drugs were found on Huang's body at the time of the search, but a packet of drugs was found near his heel, indicating that he was throwing it away out of guilt. The police lawyer argued that although the defendant's trafficking and addiction could not be actively proven, he could not escape the charge of possession. Moreover, the police stated that the Japanese men had confessed that Huang often went to buy drugs, requesting that the court investigate and handle the case according to the law. After the defendant's defense lawyer argued, the court debate concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the 31st (today). The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Gao Changfu, a Japanese national who works as an employee at the Shintalley foreign firm, residing at 26 Gujiazhai, east of Hongzhen in northern Shanghai, found a threatening letter sent by bandits at his doorstep on October 9 of this year. The letter demanded a ransom of two thousand yuan. Gao ignored the letter. The bandit gang, seeing that their plan had failed, broke into the bedroom on the morning of the 23rd of this month at 9:00 a.m., taking advantage of Gao’s family’s unpreparedness, and kidnapped Gao’s five-month-old son, Xinggen. Later, Gao’s wife, Gu, discovered that her son had been kidnapped and ran to tell her husband, reporting it to the police for investigation. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it was discovered that Xinggen had been killed by the kidnappers, who suffocated the child and placed him in a dung pit near Gujiazhai. He had been dead for a long time. The Gao couple was overcome with grief and reported it to the Linping Road police station. In addition to reporting to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation, yesterday, they ordered the local bailiff, Song Gentao, to report it to the local court for examination. Examiner Tang and other examiners arrived to examine the body.</p>

<p>Zhou Furong (age 42), a native of Chongming, recently became extremely poor and unable to make a living. At around 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, he sneaked into an open space near Huade Road near Linqing Road, pried open a small coffin of a four-year-old boy who had recently died, took out the child's body, and stripped off his four pieces of clothing worth two yuan, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes and socks, wrapped them in paper, and was about to escape when he was spotted by passersby Li Dehua, Tao Zhirong, Tao Zhisheng, and Yan Kexue, who questioned him and argued with him. They called in Chinese Constable 1327, who arrived and arrested Zhou, along with the clothes and iron shovel, and took him to the Yangshupu police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department of the First Special District Court, filed a public prosecution against Zhou Furong for the crime of harming a grave under Article 249, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, requesting severe punishment. Then, according to witnesses Li Dehua and Chinese Constable 1337, who reported the incident, the evidence was presented for inspection, and the defendant was questioned. His confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Zhou Furong to ten months in prison for stealing burial objects and confiscated the iron shovel. The burial objects were still sealed by the police in the original coffin.</p>

Former County Magistrate Ye copied and issued the regulations and investigation forms, ordering the Public Security Bureau and various district offices to investigate, create, and send them to the County Government for reporting and inclusion in this year's local budget. Now, County Magistrate Li believes that half of this year has passed and that the tax should be levied immediately. Therefore, in addition to ordering the local tax collection offices to urge the collection of old debts from previous years and rush to produce tax slips for tax collection, this year's tax collection will also be distributed to various district offices, chambers of commerce, and the Public Security Bureau for assistance. Yesterday, excerpts from the regulations were announced for public knowledge. The shop tax is levied at 10% of the rent, and the housing tax is levied at 5%. For self-owned shops, the tax is one yuan per month for every 1,000 yuan of property value, and for housing, it is 5 jiao per month.</p>

<p>At 2:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, a ship carrying 310 bags of cake flour was waiting to be unloaded at Pier No. 6652, outside the Xianghe Steamer at Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. At that time, a German merchant ship arrived there. When the engine propeller turned, a huge wave surged up, and the cargo ship, because it was heavily loaded, was sunk by the waves. Many of the goods it was carrying were lost, and those that were not lost were completely submerged in the water, resulting in a great loss. That night, shipowner Huang Changlin reported it to the Water Patrol Police for filing.</p>

<p>Scamming Cosmetics; Teahouse Waiter Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Yimin, a native of Zhejiang, recently rented a house on the seventh floor of the Xintai Building on Sixing Road in the British Concession to set up a Women’s Service Society, serving as manager himself, recruiting female employees, and purchasing goods from various cosmetics companies, all using checks. Last month, he purchased more than 140 yuan worth of goods such as fragrant powder from Shengsheng Society (i.e., Dai Chunlin) at 52 Fangbang Road in the city, all of which were three checks from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. When the checks were cashed upon maturity, they were returned, all of which were bad checks, using this to falsely set up a name to swindle goods. When the society’s manager, Zhao Guohua, negotiated with Wang, he had already fled. Yesterday, he was caught on the way by a teahouse waiter named Zhao Yejing and taken to the Town God’s Temple police station for investigation. Because the case occurred in the concession, he was instructed to report it to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Chen Qiucao's Painting Exhibition to Aid Suiyuan Opens on New Year's Day <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Qiucao, director of the renowned artistic group White Goose Painting Society, adhering to his spirit of dedicated hard work, early in his career co-founded White Goose with his close friends Fang Xuegu, Pan Sitong, and others. Furthermore, to provide amateur art enthusiasts with opportunities to study correct painting techniques, he successively established the Painting Research Institute and Correspondence Research Department. His guidance was earnest, and the facilities were perfect, making it the earliest initiator of free art research groups in the country. Through years of diligent management, it achieved considerable scale. However, the January 28th Incident suddenly erupted, and because of its strategic location, everything was destroyed. Those who heard about it deeply regretted it. Nevertheless, Chen and others persevered, unwavering in their original aspirations, and without relying on external forces, they have strived to recover over the past four years, reorganized their forces, and greatly increased their followers. Chen, considering the frequent misfortunes of the country and the increasing foreign aggression, has devoted himself to writing, creating many emotionally charged works, full of extraordinary spirit, sweeping away the decadent and pleasure-seeking atmosphere. At this time of need for support in Suiyuan, Chen, based on his sincere advocacy of the artistic salvation movement, will specifically exhibit more than one hundred of his recent works from January 2nd to 10th at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. Admission tickets cost one dime, and it is planned to remit half of the ticket revenue and proceeds from the sale of paintings to the soldiers defending the country at the front line. The art world's advocacy of aiding Suiyuan starts with this initiative, making it a prelude. The exhibition period coincides with the New Year, and a grand occasion can be anticipated.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Opening Hotels Under Business Names May Conceal Illegal Activities, Police Department Strictly Suppressing <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Police Affairs Department of the Public Concession Police Force has recently received reports stating that some individuals are opening small inns within the jurisdiction of the Old Gate Police Station. To avoid paying taxes and obtaining permits, they are not using the name of "inn" but are instead hanging signs with business names to evade the notice of the police. The department considers such incidents extremely dangerous because if these establishments harbor illegal activities, investigation becomes very difficult. Therefore, the department has ordered Lu Dagong, the Chinese detective head of the Old Gate Police Station, to investigate and suppress these activities. Detective Lu conducted separate investigations yesterday and discovered that the Tongyi establishment at No. 16, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road; the Yongkang establishment at No. 8, Lane 21, Hubei Road; the Taifengyong establishment at No. 54, Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road; the Minkang establishment in the same lane; the Heyuanxing establishment at No. 10, Lane 47, Xishanglin; and the Tongshungong establishment at No. 10, Lane 438, Edward Road, are all disguised inns. He has ordered them to quickly pay taxes and obtain licenses, or face prosecution and sealing by the court. At the same time, one opium pipe, three opium lamps, fifteen opium pellets, and a can of ash were found in the Tongshun establishment, and they were immediately taken to the police station. Yesterday, a request was submitted to the First Special District Court for confiscation.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Tang Youren Assassination Case, Suspects Continued to be Interrogated Yesterday, Police Investigation Procedures Not Completed, Request for Extension of Interrogation Granted <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tang Youren, from Hunan, was assassinated and seriously wounded to death on December 25th of last year in front of his private residence at Gan Cun, Gan Si Dong Road in the French Concession. The local authorities issued a reward for the arrest of the escaped perpetrators. Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, in conjunction with the Public Concession Police, arrested the main culprit, Liu Zhennan, at No. 228, Roberts Road, in western Shanghai. Additionally, the Public Concession Police arrested two robbers, Qiu Jiyu, and others in July. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the French Police sent detectives to transfer the suspects, Liu and Qiu, into custody and transported them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, pending investigation. During the investigation by the Fraud Bureau, the two suspects confessed to firing the shots that killed Tang and implicated their accomplices Yang Yousheng, Xiao Kaihui, Xiang Xingchang, Xu Zhimou, Tang Yongchang, and others, stating that Xiao and Xiang rented a house next door to Tang's residence to wait. This has been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. Yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, continued the trial at the First Criminal Court, ordering Liu and Qiu to be brought before the court. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer from the Police Affairs Department, stated that the investigation procedures in this case are quite complicated and have not yet been completed. He requested an extension so that after completing the investigation procedures, he could request a trial. According to Qiu Jiyu's testimony in court, five shots were fired at Tang, hitting him. Yang Yousheng rented the house next door to Tang's residence, and Xiao, Xu, and Tang lived there. During the assassination, Tang and Xu were responsible for lookout duties. Liu Zhennan requested permission from the court to recount the events of the assassination. He testified that Yang Yousheng approached him to kill someone. He was a worker at a Japanese cotton mill who had lost his job due to oppression. His family, including his elderly mother, wife, and younger sister, were suffering. Because he was illiterate, he was temporarily moved and committed the crime. He asked the court to investigate. After reviewing the testimony, the court adjourned the trial to January 8th of the 26th year [1937].</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, entered Nanjing on the 20th of this month to meet with Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi and Foreign Minister Zhang Qun to inquire about the safety of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After spending ten days there, now that Chairman Chiang has safely returned to Nanjing, Kawagoe, accompanied by his family, Counselor Shimizu, Secretary Hoshida, and others, took an early express train from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning, arriving at the North Station at 2:18 PM. Attache Wakasugi of the Japanese Embassy, Naval Attache Honda, Assistant Naval Attache Okino, Army Attache Kita, Intelligence Chief Yoshioka, Consul General in Shanghai Kawai, and representatives of the Japanese residents all welcomed him at the station. Wang Changchun, a commissioner from the Shanghai Municipal Government, Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, and Liang Fuchu, chief of the North Station Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also led police officers to protect him at the station. After disembarking, Kawagoe returned to his residence on Bixun Road to rest. Counselor Shimizu, who arrived in Shanghai with Ambassador Kawagoe, told reporters from the Central News Agency at the station that Ambassador Kawagoe's visit to Nanjing was solely to inquire about the safety of Chairman Chiang. Now that Chiang is safe, Kawagoe is very pleased. Witnessing the enthusiastic cheers and celebrations in the capital demonstrates the national fervor and extreme support for its leader, which is deeply admired. Due to the approaching New Year, he left Nanjing for Shanghai. Reports that the ambassador will return to Japan are not accurate. There has been no decision made to convene a conference of naval and army attaches after the ambassador's return to Shanghai. The Chengdu and Beihai incidents have been under negotiation for several months and will be resolved soon. Other Sino-Japanese issues remain to be discussed.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that it would continue to levy income tax from New Year's Day next year, the banking and finance industries held a joint meeting on the previous day to discuss the tax on deposit interest and resolved to comply with the Ministry's order. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Finance Industry Association held a regular meeting for its members. Pei Yunqing, a member of the Income Tax Research Committee, attended to report on the progress and decided to hold another meeting today afternoon to discuss the collection procedures. After passing the research report of the subcommittee, they will jointly submit their opinions to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Accept the Principle</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the banking and finance industries yesterday that the opinions of the banking and finance industries on income tax have been discussed by representatives of the two associations and Liang Hejun, deputy director of the Central Income Tax Affairs Office, and it has been decided to submit written opinions to the Ministry for consideration in the coming days. Regarding the case of foreign banks collecting income tax, the banking and finance industries hope to implement it simultaneously to prevent the outflow of deposits from Chinese banks and financial institutions. After Deputy Director Liang contacted the foreign banks, the principle of collection has been accepted, and there should not be many major problems. Liang has now gone to Nanjing to report the progress to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>Cable Request to Announce Collection Guidelines</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a cable to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: The association previously stated that according to Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income of profit-making enterprises may be settled annually according to the customs of each industry. In accordance with the annual settlement practices of each industry, which usually differ from January 1st of the Gregorian calendar by about forty days, to avoid misunderstandings, the association cabled your ministry on November 5th of this year, requesting a circular explanation for compliance. On November 20th of the same month, your ministry replied with Order No. 11385, stating that the matter mentioned has been considered and will be clearly stipulated in the Collection Guidelines for Category 1 Income Tax, which are currently being drafted, and will be publicly announced when collection begins. Now that the date of January 1st of the 26th year [1937] is approaching, various industries in this city are flocking to the association to inquire, making it difficult to provide reliable answers. Therefore, we are submitting this cable to your attention, requesting that you promptly announce the aforementioned collection guidelines so that we can comply. We are eagerly awaiting. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e187">Representatives of Ninety-Eight Trade Associations Discuss the Implementation of Income Tax, Yesterday Invited Three Accountants to Lecture at the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is a place where representatives of various trade associations in the city use their spare time to exchange ideas and connect with each other. It has been established for seven years. Recently, with the implementation of income tax imminent, it specially convened a dinner meeting for its members yesterday to discuss the implementation of income tax. More than 100 representatives from 98 trade associations, as well as accountants Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Jiang Wanping, and others attended. Chairman Luo Qinghua delivered a speech first, stating that since the National Government announced the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementing Rules, several months have passed, and the implementation date is approaching. Everyone knows that income tax is a good tax. Advanced countries in Europe and America use this tax revenue as a major source of national income. At this time when the country is facing serious difficulties and defending against aggression, funds are needed everywhere. Therefore, the financial authorities are introducing income tax at this time to enrich the national treasury, which is naturally understood by the people of the country. We, the people of industry and commerce, have always been patriotic and will naturally jointly support this good tax. However, since this is a new undertaking, and the calculation of income tax and the methods of collection are very complicated, if we do not prepare in advance due to the immaturity of accounting in our country's industry and commerce, obstacles will inevitably arise. We may either bear unfair tax rates due to inaccurate calculations or incur charges of concealment and evasion due to incomplete records. The Chamber of Commerce, recognizing the great importance of this to industry and commerce, has specially invited colleagues to openly discuss it in order to promote the best possible implementation, so that the good tax can achieve its true name. The Chamber of Commerce has already started organizing a research group and welcomes all members to come to the Chamber of Commerce in their spare time to discuss together, hoping that after the implementation of income tax, we can achieve the good results of enriching the national treasury and maintaining the livelihood of the people. Next, Xu Yongzuo spoke on "The Understanding and Preparation that the Business Community Should Have Regarding Income Tax," Pan Xulun spoke on "Accounting Issues of Income Tax," and Jiang Wanping spoke on "Practical Estimation of Income Tax." The following are excerpts: Xu Yongzuo's speech, titled "The Understanding and Preparation that the Business Community Should Have Regarding Income Tax," stated that income tax is a tax levied on the income of the people, so it is the most reasonable, fair, and progressive tax system. Everyone has income, which means everyone pays taxes, so the tax base is universal and complete, and it is also flexible. However, the taxation procedures for income tax are extremely cumbersome, and the calculation methods are extremely complex. Therefore, we should not only strive to support it so that it can be implemented smoothly, but also have a deep understanding of the current system and make corresponding preparations. However, given the immaturity of the intellectual level of our country's people and the uncleanness of private accounts, it is not easy to achieve the best possible implementation. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, recognizing this, has jointly organized a lecture series with our firm to give public lectures. The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has also commissioned our office to draft tax payment guidelines for various types of income tax, as well as various reporting forms and valuation rules. After two or three months of research, we believe that in order to pay income tax, the industrial and commercial sectors should, in addition to having a thorough understanding of the current system, urgently prepare two points: one is the improvement of accounting books, and the other is the organization of capital property. The calculation of income cannot be fabricated out of thin air, and the reporting form, balance sheet, income statement, and property inventory must be based on clear accounts and vouchers. Otherwise, the tax office will directly determine the income amount, and even if it is unfavorable, there is no way to argue. However, with the accounting system and bookkeeping methods currently used by most merchants, it is difficult to achieve the goal of accuracy and clarity. Therefore, it is necessary to improve them in a timely manner. As for capital and public bonds, they are important components in determining the tax rate, and the verification of their amounts is very important. However, merchants in our country have not paid much attention to this point in the past. The actual investment amount may be greater than the capital amount on the books, and the actual property value may not match the value on the books. All of this has a significant impact on the calculation of income tax. Therefore, before the opening of the tax, it is necessary to re-estimate and thoroughly clean up. Pan Xulun's speech on accounting issues of income tax briefly stated that the calculation of the income tax amount is a relatively specialized issue. According to the income tax laws and regulations in our country, the calculation method for profit income is to deduct various business expenses and other deductible items from the total income of an organization. The remaining amount is the net income. Then, the ratio of the net income to the capital amount can be used to determine the tax rate and the tax amount to be paid. Therefore, accounting issues related to profit income can be divided into three categories. The first is how to determine the capital amount, the second is how to determine the total income, and the third is how to determine the deductible amount. However, these three categories of issues, judging from the income tax collection situations in various countries, seem to be full of complexities and changes. Therefore, industrial and commercial organizations in various countries often entrust accounting experts to handle tax matters on their behalf. This is similar to the situation in our country recently, where lawsuits are often entrusted to lawyers. Accountant Jiang Wanping spoke on income tax issues, stating that it is most important for taxpayers to pay attention to the integrity of accounting matters in order to ensure that all calculations are reasonable and legal. On the other hand, there should be proof of moderation in order to reduce the trouble of direct investigation by government offices. Therefore, the original draft of the income tax regulations had provisions for accountant certification, but due to the small number of accountants in our country, it is difficult to achieve universality, so it is temporarily difficult to formulate. However, we hope that those who cannot universally obtain suitable certification should still seek other ways to moderate. As for the procedures for reporting, confidential investigation, review, tax refund, and appeal, they should be as simple and convenient as possible to facilitate matters. Now that the implementation of income tax is approaching, there is not enough time to fully prepare for improvements. For urgent needs, it seems that each trade association should quickly unify accounting subjects and standardize the names of books and records based on the industry's situation. Then the bookkeeping procedures and processes will naturally be roughly determined, and they will be distributed to each trade for uniform use. Those who do not understand can consult with a specialist designated by the trade association or its accounting consultant for guidance. Various books and forms should be prepared monthly for month-end settlement, which can change the old accounting situation and gradually enter the path of rationality.</p>

<h3 id="e189">National Labor Maritime Conference Delegate Wang Zigang Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday to Report on the Proceedings <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zigang, the employer representative who attended the 21st and 22nd International Labor Conference Maritime Meetings, returned to China and visited the authorities of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing on the 25th of this month to report on the proceedings of the meeting. He hosted a press conference at the Shipping Club at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the proceedings. The following is a record of his report:</p>
<p>Once Every Three Years</p>
<p>Wang first stated that the Labor Conference discusses all industrial and commercial issues on land, while the Maritime Meeting specifically discusses maritime issues. The meeting was held on October 16th and closed on October 24th. The Labor Conference is held annually due to the complexity of the affairs, while the Maritime Meeting is held every three years. China first decided to attend the Maritime Meeting at the 13th session, with Chen Ganqing as the representative. This time, Wang represented China for the second time.</p>
<p>This Year's Meeting</p>
<p>The Maritime Meeting held a preliminary meeting last year to determine the agenda for this year's meeting. This time was the 21st and 22nd sessions combined because the League of Nations convention stipulates that all motions must be passed by two sessions before they can be established. The purpose of the Labor Conference and the Maritime Meeting is to seek equal treatment for land and sea workers. A total of over two hundred representatives from fifty countries attended the Maritime Meeting. Each country had four representatives, divided into two government representatives and one labor and capital representative each. Consultants and secretaries were appointed as needed. Each representative had one voting right. The government representatives from China were Li Pingheng and Bao Huaguo, the labor representative was Zhao Banfu, and the capital representative was Wang.</p>
<p>Five Major Proposals</p>
<p>There were five major proposals at this year's meeting: (1) regulations on working hours for seafarers and the issue of personnel allocation; (2) the responsibilities of shipowners to seafarers and the issue of seafarer illness insurance; (3) the issue of paid leave for seafarers; (4) the technical issues of officers and engineers working on ships; and (5) the equipment of each port for the safety, entertainment, and medical treatment of seafarers.</p>
<p>Form a Committee</p>
<p>During the meeting, a committee was formed for each issue to study everything. Each committee had government, labor, and capital representatives participating. At last year's preliminary meeting, the five proposals were distributed to various countries, and the opinions and proposals of various countries were compiled into draft conventions for discussion item by item. The first article was fiercely contested by European countries because it was related to international shipping and their interests were at stake. Wang participated in the discussion of the second and fourth articles because they were closely related to China.</p>
<p>Pass the Convention</p>
<p>Many conventions were amended and passed during the meeting, such as the convention on seafarer trainees, which originally stipulated fourteen years old as the youngest limit, but has now been changed to fifteen years old. All conventions passed are distributed by the Labor Bureau to the labor bureaus of various countries, requiring them to be submitted to the legislative bodies of their respective governments for approval and implementation within eighteen months, and to report the annual situation to the Labor Bureau (countries that do not approve the convention have no obligation to fulfill it). All normal international affairs are handled by the Labor Bureau.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the Inspection</p>
<p>Wang continued, stating that after the meeting, he went to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries for inspection. There were two important impressions from this trip: (1) It is undeniable that our country's shipping industry is backward. The only solution is for all shipping companies to cooperate to strengthen the domestic organization and then seek to develop international shipping. (2) International shipping is related to import and export trade. National cooperation is necessary to develop outward. If national finances are solid and foreign exchange is balanced, then all matters will be easy to handle. If industries are divided and work is carried out without internal friction, then the future is infinitely hopeful. At present, various countries have a considerable understanding of us and are willing to cooperate with each other. For example, the United Kingdom sent Patrick, a representative for export credit loans to China. Wang met with him in England and hoped to help China develop international shipping.</p>

<p>More than one hundred workers from five locations of the Shanghai YMCA have a joint celebration every year during Christmas, usually holding a dinner and distributing gifts. This year, the workers decided to donate the celebration expenses of more than 150 yuan directly to Suiyuan to comfort the soldiers, motivated by the sense of responsibility that every citizen has for the rise and fall of the nation. Their ambition is truly commendable.</p>

<p>Qian Dajun, director of the Military Affairs Committee Chairman's Office, and Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Pacification Office, flew to Shanghai on the same plane the night before. Zhu rested at his private residence on Masnan Road, while Qian entered Hong'en Hospital on Daxi Road that night for treatment. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun, Commander of the Security Regiment Ji Zhangjian, as well as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, and others visited to offer comfort. Mayor Wu introduced Cao Chentao, director of surgery at the Shanghai Municipal Hunan Hospital, to the hospital for treatment. X-rays were taken twice yesterday morning to examine the extent of the lung injury. Following the doctor's advice that hospitalization was unnecessary, returning to his residence would be more convenient. Therefore, he was discharged from the hospital at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning and returned to his private residence on Haige Road for rest. Earlier, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited the hospital in the morning and was received by Ouyang Ju, chief of staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. He said that Qian's bullet wound entered from the left back, passed through the apex of the lung, and exited from the right shoulder blade. Qian received medication only at 11:00 AM, after being wounded at 4:00 AM in the morning, bleeding for six hours. Fortunately, he was physically strong and had strong resistance, so there was no major problem. Qian is still in good spirits and eating as usual, but the doctor instructed him not to see many guests in order to recover as soon as possible, so he can rest carefully. He will recover in a few weeks. Furthermore, according to Qian's family last night, the results of Qian's X-ray examination were very good. The injury to the apex of the lung was not critical.</p>

<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city held a graduation ceremony for the students of the New Movement Training Class yesterday at 2:00 PM on the third floor of the Chamber of Commerce. A dinner party was also held last night at the Tongxinglou restaurant. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Guests Present</p>
<p>The graduation ceremony was held yesterday at 2:00 PM. The attendees included instructor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan), Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Chief of General Affairs Jiang Hao, Dong Ping from the Second Branch of the High Court, Cai Jinjun from the Public Safety Bureau (represented by Han Fen), Huang Boqiao from the Two-Roads Administration, Chen Chengshi from the Special Party Branch of the Two-Roads, Zhang Lianke from the Steel Plant of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Cheng Deyuan from the Seamen's Union, Yang Hu from the Songhu Garrison Command (represented by Lu Jingshi), Yang Zhonghan from the Special Party Branch of the Seamen, Sheng Juncai from the International Trade Bureau, Shen Xuejun from the Accountants Association, Qin Liankui from the Lawyers Association, and over one hundred students.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremony began, Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating that the New Movement Association held this New Movement Training Class. All the students usually serve in various agencies, organizations, and schools, and they took time out to participate. Now that the training period is over, they should put what they have learned into practice. Regarding this training class, he had two points to make: (1) In the recent days of national rejoicing and dancing, we expressed our support for the Supreme Leader. The Leader's support from the national populace stems from the influence of his personality and spirit. In recent years, the New Movement advocated by the Leader is a great manifestation of his personality and spirit. Therefore, to support the Leader, we must strive to promote the New Movement, making Shanghai, in both public and private life, do its best to make progress day by day. (2) During this time, you all studied and learned together, and you must have understood the theory of the New Movement and clearly understood the principles of the New Movement. From now on, you should work hard to put it into practice. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's preface to his book, "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction", states that this book is not for reading, but is equivalent to the drill of infantry. The New Life Movement should not only be talked about, but also learned and practiced. Now that the work of purchasing is complete, we must all work hard to promote it, making public and private life in the city all transformed by the New Life Movement. This is the infinite hope I hold.</p>
<p>Report on General Affairs</p>
<p>Jiang Hao then gave a report on general affairs, stating that the training period of the association was two months, with 46 hours of instruction. The subjects included: (1) The Three Principles of the People and the New Life Movement; (2) The Theory and Practice of the New Life Movement; (3) The New Life Movement and the Cultural Construction Movement; (4) The New Life Movement and the National Economic Movement; (5) The New Life Movement and National Rejuvenation; (6) The Promotion of the Three-Part Plan and the Organization and Training Methods of the Labor Service Corps; (7) Music; (8) Air Defense Knowledge; (9) First Aid Knowledge. Regarding the occupational statistics of the students, 24 belonged to Party affairs, 39 to public affairs, 12 to public security, 15 to universities, 39 to middle schools, 36 to organizations, and 14 were recommended individually. Regarding academic qualifications, 50 were university graduates, 17 were university students, 64 were middle school graduates, 30 were middle school students, and 18 were unspecified, totaling 179 people.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<p>Commander Yang's representative, Lu Jingshi, gave a speech, stating that everyone here has studied the New Movement for two months and has a better understanding of it. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that knowing is difficult, but doing is easy. Now that you all "know" the New Movement, it will be easier to "do" it in the future. Wang Yangming also said that knowledge and action should be united. Therefore, after "knowing", you must "act". The environment in Shanghai is filled with smog and foul air, making the promotion of the New Movement even more necessary. Therefore, you should all promote and develop the New Movement in the future, so that Shanghai can be replaced with a new vitality. If this is extended to the whole country, the nation can be saved. Director Huang Boqiao gave a speech, stating that China has a civilization history of five thousand years. All aspects of life are only well-spoken of in writing, but have not yet been put into practice. The New Life Movement proposed today is still to put forward the unique morals of China, so that everyone can follow them without deviation. He recently traveled along the Yangtze River and saw that the cities along the river have been焕然一新 compared to the past. This is the effect of promoting the New Movement. This is praised by both Chinese and foreigners. If all 450 million people can earnestly follow the New Movement, then no country in the world will dare to insult our country again, and our country will surely be strong. He is in charge of transportation and pays special attention to the New Movement. If traveling merchants can follow the New Movement, it will be more convenient to manage. Chen Chengshi and student Fan Zhenbang also gave speeches, with the length of the speeches omitted. Then the ceremony was declared over, and photos were taken before everyone dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Written on the Last Page <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Another year has passed! A set of new calendars has been torn to the last page from my hand, and another set of new calendars will take its place; and another set of days will be torn from my hand as it is now to the last day. Year after year, time flows away like water, and I only feel lost that I am getting old!</p>
<p>Although at the beginning of each year, I always set many wishes and plans, hoping to have a little bit of precious harvest in the new year, whether for myself, for society, or for the country. But life is too unsatisfactory, and wishes and plans seem like flowers in a mirror and the moon in the water. Only on this day of each year can I take a breath and move the unfinished work to the account of another new year.</p>
<p>But each time I fail, is it that my wishes and plans are too extravagant, or is it my own lack of effort, leading to this result? Here I don't want to defend myself. Every young person is ambitious and far-sighted. Their wishes and their plans, perhaps in another's eyes, are simply dreams, never to be successful. This, of course, I know very clearly. Young people only have success, not failure. Success is our responsibility, but failure is our shame! However, a warning sign stands in front of us—steadiness! You are not allowed to move. Thus, countless young people wander on detours, at a loss.</p>
<p>However, young people bear the heavy responsibility of being the future masters of the country. We not only hope for ourselves, but are also greatly hoped for. But no one saves us from detours and puts us on the broad road. Even if we accidentally discover the road to the broad road, it is our own people who prevent us from moving forward. Do you still want to plan? Do you still want to make wishes? It's the last day of another year!</p>
<p>"I wish I were blind! Let me grope in the darkness!" I remember these two sentences. But who wants to close their eyes? Looking ahead, I am making my hopes and plans again, today.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Street <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>The city street at dusk.</p>
<p>When the butcher shop no longer has bloody pig heads and the vegetable leaves in front of the small stalls are left for the chicks to peck at, the lines of the evening are even more blurred on the narrow city street. The wind is so strong, and the days in winter get dark so early.</p>
<p>On the quiet street, a wonton vendor walks by, tapping his clapper. The firelight in the stove sways in the wind, and a small bean oil lamp flickers. Several shy children stand next to it, their greedy eyes also flickering. A finger instinctively goes into their mouths to gnaw on, and their stomachs rumble somehow.</p>
<p>The wonton seller, like a wandering performer, scoops the hot soup from the pot, then slowly pours it back into the pot, teasing the children's appetites as he scoops it into the bowl. He looks at the greedy children proudly through the fog woven by the steam.</p>
<p>The children run away shyly, and when they return home, the side dishes for dinner are also delicious. The doors of the shops on both sides are gradually closing tightly: no, it is not people closing the doors, but the doors closing in the people.</p>
<p>The city street is even more melancholy, and there are still vendors selling late-night snacks, tapping their clappers, sparsely measuring the bottomless night.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Ferry <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Lu</p>
<p>Across the river, there is an old ferry, without an awning or oars, with a thin bamboo pole stuck there. An old man sits dozing under half of a cart shed, and he is the boatman who poles the ferry.</p>
<p>He never seems to get enough sleep, and he dozes off on the cartwheel whenever he has time. Or perhaps there are too few people crossing the river?</p>
<p>All around is a wilderness, and the wind whistles in the air, not knowing where it comes from or where it is going. The old man only feels that when a whistle blows, there is a cold air as sharp as steel needles逼进 from the thatched cracks of the cart shed, so he moves his seat slightly, as if this can make him warmer. His shy eyes also squint open a slit, looking to the opposite bank to see if there is anyone calling for the ferry. He also silently counts the copper coins he already has in his pocket, one, two, three...counting to eleven without further ado. The fare is one copper coin per person, so eleven people have crossed the river today. But no, he remembers very clearly that Huang Da Niang's son is sick, and Huang Da Niang crossed the river in the morning to go to Ba to ask a doctor. She said that she didn't have any change in her pocket, and she would pay when she came back. So he glanced at the opposite bank again. He still has the income of two copper coins!</p>
<p>The river suddenly roars, as if it wants to devour his old ferry. Gradually the waves roll ashore, perhaps even the only oxcart shed that can shelter from the wind and rain will be washed away? But the old man immediately wakes up. Today, gasoline boats are running from Dongjia Ditch to Gao Town. In the morning, there was also a series of "pa pa pa" sounds, stirring up the yellow mud at the bottom of the river, dyeing the river surface a scorched yellow. His ferry is like a kite with a broken string,颠来摆去 on the shore, and the bow of the boat is covered with sewage.</p>
<p>He watches the gasoline boat sailing from the east and heading west, so fast, like an arrow.</p>
<p>——If, he thinks, he had such a gasoline boat, it would probably only take two minutes to cross the river once, and he could stand at the stern of the boat without any effort, like an officer or something. He can't help but puff out his chest. He sees the person in the Zhongshan suit on the gasoline boat looking at the front of the river so smartly.</p>
<p>But that is a nightmare! After the gasoline boat passes, the river gradually stabilizes, the yellow mud also settles down, and the river water is as clear as a mirror. Under the sun, his broken boat is parked there, and even the shadow of the thin bamboo pole is lying quietly on the river surface.</p>
<p>This broken ferry often makes the guests who pay one copper coin to cross the river dissatisfied. "Why don't you make an awning?" They seem to blame the old man for not making the guests safe after collecting the fare. On rainy and snowy days, they have to stay at the ferry for half a day before the ferry slowly and weakly搖攏 comes over. Sometimes, when the old man is vaguely asleep, the guests crossing the river have to raise their voices to wake him up. When they get on the boat, they can breathe a sigh of relief and sit down, but the boat is also full of water, and there isn't even an awning. They look at the old man wearing a worn raincoat and think he is too comfortable.</p>
<p>"Humph! You are wearing a raincoat, but you let everyone get wet in the rain? Why don't you make an awning?"</p>
<p>To such questions, the old man can only勉强 laugh and say, "I'm poor! I want to save up a few more fares. Next year, I will definitely make an awning, next year I will definitely make an awning."</p>
<p>But he is already over fifty years old.</p>
<p>Someone on the opposite bank is calling for the ferry, and he puts down his dreamlike hope and stands up. He knows it must be Huang Da Niang coming back from town. Jumping into the boat, he uses the strength of his wrist from his youth, and he has already sailed halfway across the river in two strokes. Now he sees clearly that the person calling for the ferry is not Huang Da Niang, but a stranger. Although he feels that it will be dark soon if he waits any longer, this one copper coin business is still worth doing.</p>
<p>Back in the oxcart shed, the wind seems to be stronger. Why hasn't Huang Da Niang come back?</p>
<p>Someone is calling his name again, the voice is coming from behind, it is A Gen Ge, Huang Da Niang's neighbor. He says that Huang Da Niang came back from town on a gasoline boat, and she will send the fare tomorrow.</p>
<p>The sky is getting darker, and he can hardly see anything in front of him. Next year, I will definitely make an awning. This hope hammers heavily in his heart. The wind blows the whiskers under his chin, and he coughs.</p>

<h3 id="e202">New Type of Comedy "The Sequel to Incarnation Girl" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The appearance of Incarnation Girl not only laid the foundation for Chinese comedy with the most beautiful posture, but also flaunted the audience with the most skillful techniques, so that the general public also believed that the Chinese film industry can also produce a perfect and interesting comedy. After the film was released, it caused a sensation everywhere, winning the welcome of a large number of audiences. The producer, Yihua Film Company, also produced a sequel, written by the original screenwriter Huang Jiamo and directed by the original director Fang Peilin, who spent eight months filming it. Yuan Meiyun plays the incarnation girl, and Han Lagen and Guan Hongda play Laurel and Hardy. In addition to the original cast from the previous film, three more stars were added: a glamorous star Lu Ming, a suave villain Wang Naidong, and a dull-witted Liang Dusheng. This created a gorgeous sequel, and the plot and acting skills broke the record of the previous film. It is expected to re-attract the audience of Incarnation Girl, allowing all movie lovers to get a real and valuable enjoyment of two hours. The film is scheduled to be released on New Year's Day at the Carlton Theater.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Time Cinema New Year's Issue Published <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Time Cinema New Year's Issue was published today. The content is more exciting than before. The sixteen-page photogravure pictorial is edited by Xi Yuqun and features new poses and new photos. The texts include topics such as the material problems of Chinese films and the breasts of female stars from the perspective of bodybuilding. Each copy is still sold for 2 dimes and is distributed by the Time Bookstore Company at No. 240 Avenue Joffre, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e204">"Soaring Aspirations" Premieres Today <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The highly anticipated film "Soaring Aspirations" premieres today at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre in this city. This is a great work that Xinhua Company contributes to compatriots throughout the country during this extraordinary period. The story is based on a province in China, where farmers wage a heroic resistance for survival. This theme is undoubtedly extremely necessary in China today.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, director Wu Yonggang's past achievements are enough to guarantee your satisfaction. The complete cast, such as Jin Yan, Wang Renmei, Chen Juanjuan, Wang Cilong, Han Langan, Tian Fang, Li Mingjian, Zhang Zhizhi, and other popular actors, fills this film with a lively atmosphere. This is definitely something worth telling you all. In order to alleviate crowding, the theater will add a show at 10:00 AM every day from New Year's Day to the 3rd. Furthermore, "Suiyuan Frontline News," which Xinhua Company took great pains to film at risk, is also being screened simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Cathay Screens "Silver Screen Scandal" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Mae West's New Work of Sensuality</p>
<p>Mae West can be said to be a unique beauty on the screen. She is not only good at acting but also writes scripts and dialogues. It is insufficient to merely view her through the lens of "flirtatiousness" and "romance." Like her previous films "I'm No Angel," etc., and "Go West Young Man," which opens today at the Cathay Grand Theatre, are all plays she wrote herself. In "Silver Screen Scandal," she plays the lead role, portraying a glamorous movie star. She feels that none of the men in the city are suitable for her. Later, she unexpectedly encounters a strong and powerful pilot in the countryside. She uses various methods to seduce him, but unfortunately, he is a man who does not understand romance, leaving Mae West feeling lost and confused. Her extremely unrestrained emotions and coquettish demeanor vividly depict the psychological experiences of a romantic woman. Such a good play can probably only be written and performed by Mae West.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Drama Workshop Actively Rehearsing "Sunrise" Ouyang Yuqian to Direct <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Now that the national crisis is becoming increasingly profound, drama, the most effective weapon for organizing the masses, is experiencing a vigorous resurgence, despite being subjected to severe external pressure. This is naturally a good sign.</p>
<p>Recently, amidst the successive establishment and preparation for public performances by many drama groups, the "Drama Workshop," which has been in the works for a long time, has also announced its establishment. The main people in charge of the society are Feng Zi and Wu Tieyi, former leaders of the Fudan Drama Society. The sponsors include Ouyang Yuqian, Ying Yunwei, Zhao Jingshen, A Ying, Jin Xingyao... and others. Most of the basic actors are members of the Fudan Drama Society, and they are all quite familiar to the audience.</p>
<p>The first play to be performed by the "Drama Workshop" has been decided as Mr. Cao Yu's new work, the sensational four-act play "Sunrise." It was originally planned to have either Mr. Ouyang Yuqian or Mr. Ying Yunwei take on the role of director, but now, due to Mr. Ying's busy schedule, it has been decided that Mr. Ouyang will direct. They have been actively rehearsing in recent days, and it is expected that they will be able to meet the audience on stage in about a month.</p>
<p>"Sunrise" is Cao Yu's accomplished work completed this year. After its publication, the theater world acknowledged it as an even more successful work than Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm." "Thunderstorm" was first performed in Shanghai by Ms. Feng Zi and the actors of the Fudan Drama Society, and the director was also Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. Now that the entire team from "Thunderstorm" is performing "Sunrise," they are familiar with the work, and the future sensation can probably be predicted.</p>
